    "text": "The Mongol invasions of Vietnam or Mongol-Vietnamese Wars refer to the military campaigns launched by the Mongol Empire, and later the Yuan dynasty, against the kingdom of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t ruling by Tr\u1ea7n dynasty (modern-day northern Vietnam) and the Champa (modern-day southern Vietnam) in 1258, 1282-1284, 1285, and 1287-88\\. In studies of China and Mongolia, the campaigns are often treated as a success due to the establishment of tributary relations with \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t despite the Mongols suffering several military defeats. In contrast, Vietnamese historiography emphasizes the Dai Viet military victories. The first invasion began in 1258 under the united Mongol Empire, as it looked for alternative paths to invade Song China. The Mongol general Uriyangkhadai was successful in capturing the Vietnamese capital Thang Long (modern-day Hanoi) before turning north in 1259 to invade the Song dynasty in modern-day Guangxi as part of a coordinated Mongol attack with armies attacking in Sichuan under M\u00f6ngke Khan and other Mongol armies attacking in modern-day Shandong and Henan. The first invasion also established tributary relations between the Vietnamese kingdom, formerly a Song dynasty tributary state, and the Yuan dynasty. In 1282, Kublai Khan and the Yuan dynasty launched a naval invasion of Champa that also resulted in the establishment of tributary relations. Intending to demand greater tribute and direct Yuan oversight of local affairs in \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t and Champa, the Yuan launched another invasion in 1285. The second invasion of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t failed to accomplish its goals, and the Yuan launched a third invasion in 1287 with the intent of replacing the uncooperative \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t ruler Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng with the defected Tr\u1ea7n prince Tr\u1ea7n \u00cdch T\u1eafc. By the end of the second and third invasions, which involved both initial successes and large losses for the Mongols, the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t and Champa decided to accept the nominal supremacy of the Yuan dynasty and serve as tributary states in order to avoid further conflicts. ==Background== By the 1250s, the Mongol Empire controlled large amounts of Eurasia including much of Eastern Europe, Anatolia, North China, Mongolia, Manchuria, Central Asia, Tibet and Southwest Asia. M\u00f6ngke Khan (r. 1251-59) planned to attack the Song dynasty in southern China from three directions in 1259. Therefore, he ordered the prince Kublai to pacify the Dali Kingdom. Uriyangkhadai led successful campaigns in the southwest of China and pacified tribes in Tibet before turning east towards \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t by 1257. In the autumn of 1257, Uriyangkhadai addressed three letters to Vietnamese ruler Tr\u1ea7n Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng (known as Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u1eadt C\u1ea3nh by the Mongol) demanding passage through to southern China. Tr\u1ea7n Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng opposed the encroachment of a foreign army across his territory to attack their ally, and so prepared soldiers on elephants to deter the Mongol troops. After the three successive envoys were imprisoned in the capital Thang Long (modern-day Hanoi) of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t, Uriyangkhadai invaded \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t with generals Trechecdu and Aju in the rear. The ancestors of the Tr\u1ea7n clan originated from the province of Fujian and later migrated to \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t under Tr\u1ea7n Kinh \u9673\u4eac (Ch\u00e9n J\u012bng), the ancestor of the Tr\u1ea7n clan in 1127. Their descendants, the later rulers of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t who were of mixed-blooded descent later replaced the house of L\u00fd, established the Tr\u1ea7n dynasty in 1226, which ruled Vietnam (\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t); despite many intermarriages between the Tr\u1ea7n and several royal members of the L\u00fd royals alongside members of their royal court as in the case of Tr\u1ea7n L\u00fd and Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1eeba, some of the mixed-blooded descendants of the Tr\u1ea7n dynasty and certain members of the clan could still speak Chinese such as when a Yuan dynasty envoy had a meeting with the Chinese-speaking Tr\u1ea7n prince Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c Tu\u1ea5n in 1282. p. 190. Kublai Khan, the fifth Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, and the founder of the Yuan dynasty Historian Liam Kelley noted that people from Song dynasty China like Zhao Zhong and Xu Zongdao escaped to \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t after the Mongol invasion of the Song and helped the Vietnamese fight against the Mongol invasion. The ancestors of the Tr\u1ea7n clan originated from the Fujian region of China as did the Daoist Chinese cleric Xu Zongdao who recorded the Mongol invasion and referred to them as \"Northern bandits\". He quoted the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t S\u1eed K\u00fd To\u00e0n Th\u01b0 which said \u201cWhen the Song [Dynasty] was lost, its people came to us. Nh\u1eadt Du\u1eadt took them in. There was Zhao Zhong who served as his personal guard. Therefore, among the accomplishments in defeating the Yuan [i.e., Mongols], Nh\u1eadt Du\u1eadt had the most.\u201dproof that he runs the blog Southern Song Chinese military officers and civilian officials left to overseas countries, went to Vietnam and intermarried with the Vietnamese ruling elite and went to Champa to serve the government there as recorded by Zheng Sixiao. Southern Song soldiers were part of the Vietnamese army prepared by emperor Tr\u1ea7n Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng against the second Mongol invasion. == First Mongol invasion in 1258 == First Mongol - Tr\u1ea7n war (1257-1258) ===Background=== In 1258, a Mongol column under Uriyangkhadai, the son of Subutai, invaded \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t. According to Vietnamese sources, the Mongol army consisted of at least 30,000 soldiers of which at least 2,000 were Yi troops from the Dali Kingdom. Modern scholarship points to a force of several thousand Mongols, ordered by Kublai to invade with Uriyangkhadai in command, which battled with the Viet forces on 17 January 1258. ===Campaign=== 13th-century sword \u0111ao and iron-hooks. Tr\u1ea7n dynasty period, National Treasure, Vietnam Military History Museum A battle was fought in which the Vietnamese used war elephants: king Tr\u1ea7n Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng even led his army from atop an elephant. Aju ordered his troops to fire arrows at the elephants' feet. The animals turned in panic and caused disorder in the Vietnamese army, which was routed. The Vietnamese senior leaders were able to escape on pre-prepared boats while part of their army was destroyed at No Nguyen (modern Viet Tri on the Hong River). The remainder of the Dai Viet army again suffered a major defeat in a fierce battle at the Ph\u00fa L\u1ed9 bridge the day after. This led the Vietnamese monarch to evacuate the capital. The \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t annals reported that the evacuation was \"in an orderly manner;\" however this is viewed as a embellishment because the Vietnamese had to retreat in disarray to leave their weapons behind in the capital.Descending Dragon, Rising Tiger: A History of Vietnam by Vu Hong Lien, Peter Sharrock, Chapter 6. King Tr\u1ea7n Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng fled to an offshore island, while the Mongols occupied the capital city Th\u0103ng Long (modern-day Hanoi). They found their envoys in prison, however one of whom died. Although the Mongols had successfully captured the capital, the provinces around the capital were still under Vietnamese control. While Chinese source material is sometimes misinterpreted as saying that Uriyangkhadai withdrew from Vietnam due to poor climate, Uriyangkhadai left Thang Long after nine days to invade the Song dynasty in modern-day Guangxi in a coordinated Mongol attack with armies attacking in Sichuan under M\u00f6ngke Khan and other Mongol armies attacking in modern-day Shandong and Henan. The Mongol army gained the popular local nickname of \"Buddhist enemies\" because they did not loot nor kill while moving north out to Yunnan. After the loss of a prince and the capital, Tr\u1ea7n Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng submitted to the Mongols. In 1258, the Vietnamese monarch commenced regular diplomatic relations and a tributary relationship with the Mongol court, treating them as equals to the embattled Southern Song dynasty without renouncing their ties to the Song. == Invasion of Champa in 1282 == King Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng was the political leader of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t during the Mongol invasion, ruled from 1278 to 1293 Portrait of Prince Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c Tu\u1ea5n (1228-1300), was known to the Mongol as H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o \u0111\u1ea1i V\u01b0\u01a1ng, the military hero of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t during the second and third Mongols invasion, 19th century Vietnamese painting. With the defeat of the Song dynasty in 1276, the newly established Yuan dynasty turned its attention to the south, particularly Champa and \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t. In late 1281, Kublai decided to make Champa to be a new province of the Yuan Empire, and announced the invasion of Champa. Sogetu of the Jalairs, the governor of Guangzhou, was dispatched to demand the submission of Champa. Although the king of Champa accepted the status of a Mongol protectorate,Grousset, R. (1970) p. 290 his submission was unwilling. In March 1282, Sogetu led a maritime invasion of Champa with 5,000 men, but could only muster 100 ships because most of the Yuan ships had been lost in the invasions of Japan.Delgado, J. (2008) p. 158 Sogetu's fleet arrived and landed in Champa's capital Vijaya in 17 February 1283, and captured the city two days later, but then withdrew and set up camps outside the city. The aged Champa king Indravarman V retreated out of the capital, avoiding Mongol attempts to capture him in the hills. The Cham king and his prince both refused to visit Mongol camp, and ambushed Sogetu's troops in the mountains. His son would wage guerrilla warfare against the Mongols for the next two years, eventually wearing down the invaders.Delgado, J. (2008) p. 159 Stymied by the withdrawal of the Champa king, Sogetu asked for reinforcements from Kublai but sailed home in March 1284 just as another Mongol fleet with more than 15,000 troops under Ataqai and Arigh Khaiya embarked on a fruitless mission to reinforce him. Sogetu presented his plan to have more troops invade Champa through \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t. Kublai accepted his plan and put his son Toghan in command, with Sogetu as second in command. ==Second Mongol invasion in 1285== Second Mongol invasion of Vietnam (1284-1285) Mobile trebuchets deployed by both Mongol Yuan and the Vietnamese in Vietnam ===Background=== In 1266, the Vietnamese monarch Tr\u1ea7n Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng (son of Tr\u1ea7n Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng) agreed in 1266 to acknowledge the overlordship of Kublai Khan, however in the following year, he rejected the \"Six-Duties of a vassal state\" of the Mongol Emperor gave, included the permit the stationing of a darughachi (regional general) with authority over the local administration. In 1278, Tr\u1ea7n Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng retired and made crown prince Tr\u1ea7n Kh\u00e2m (as known as Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng) as the successor. Kublai Khan was dissatisfied with the tributary arrangement, which granted the Yuan dynasty the same amount of tribute as the former Song dynasty had received, and requested greater tributary payments. These demands included taxes to the Mongols in both money and labor, \"incense, gold, silver, cinnabar, agarwood, sandalwood, ivory, tortoiseshell, pearls, rhinoceros horn, silk floss, and porcelain cups\", and direct oversight from a Mongol-appointed darughachi. In 1283, Khubilai Khan sent word to \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t that he intended to send Yuan armies through Vietnamese territory to attack the kingdom of Champa, with demands for provisions and other support to the Yuan army. In 1284 Kublai appointed his son Toghan () to conquer Champa. Toghan demanded from the Vietnamese a route to Champa, which would trap the Champan army from both north and south. While Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng and Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng initially accepted the demand reluctantly, then denied, and ordered an defensive war against the Mongol army. A Yuan envoy recorded that the Vietnamese had already sent 500 ships to help the Cham. As the Mongol invasion was imminent, in 1284, king Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng held the All-Vietnamese Central Executive Conference of Di\u00ean H\u1ed3ng (Vietnamese: H\u1ed9i Ngh\u1ecb Di\u00ean H\u1ed3ng), with the participation of all nobles and officials. All members of the Conference agreed to resist the Mongol invasion rather than accept the \"darughachi\" system. The king ordered all regulars and military to tattoo on their hands two words \"S\u00e1t Th\u00e1t\" (, death to the Tatars).Vtudien dictionary ===Campaign=== The main Yuan army led by Toghon was said in History of Yuan to consist of 8 tumens, with some 20,000 unarmed Jurchen and Han Chinese supporters, and many Yuan veterans such as Ariq Qaya (Uyghur), Li Heng (Tangut), Bolqadar, and Mangqudai.History of the Yuan Dynasty, vol. 209 Yuan troops crossed the Friendship Pass (Sino-Vietnamese border's gate) in 27 January 1285. After passed the mountainous terrains with collecting nails, traps along the highway, Mongol forces captured 400 Song officers who were fighting alongside with the Vietnamese. In the Red River Delta, the combined Yuan land forces attacked the Vietnamese forces by land and river, destroyed several Vietnamese catapults (Hu dun pao) along the Red River, successful captured \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t's capital Th\u0103ng Long and drove the Vietnamese forces and the Royal family to the coast. Planning to weaken the enemies first, the Vietnamese royal family abandoned the capital and retreated south while enacting a scorched earth campaign by abandoning empty capital and cities, burning villages and crops where the Mongols occupied. At the same time, Sogetu moved his army up north in an attempt to envelop the Vietnamese royal family in a pincer movement, but Kinh Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng and his army managed to escape to Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh, and re-concentrated here. The king tried to prevent Sogetu from linking with Toghon, but failed and forced royal family retreated to the coastal Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh province. The Yuan forces under Omar launched two naval offensives in April and again drove the Vietnamese forces to the south. Sogetu's army was weakened by the summer heat and the lack of food, so they stopped chasing the royal family and move north to join with Toghan. Seeing the Mongols\u2019 movement, prince Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c Tu\u1ea5n concluded that the Mongol army was weakened and decided to take the opportunity to strike, selecting battlefields where the Mongol cavalry could not be fully employed. The Cham were in pursuit of Sogetu as he was heading north, and killed him and defeated his army.Delgado, J. (2008) p. 160 However, according to Vietnamese history, Sogetu was defeated in H\u00e0m T\u1eed, H\u01b0ng Y\u00ean and was killed by the Vietnamese in his retreat. In May 1285, situation began changing as Yuan's supplies running low. Take avdantage, a Vietnamese fleet under prince Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c Tu\u1ea5n sailed to the north and attacked V\u1ea1n Ki\u1ebfp, the important Mongol camp and cut off the Mongol supplies. As the Yuan forces bogged down in the Red River delta, dispersing their power, Prime Minister Quang Kh\u1ea3i personally launched a large counterattack at Ch\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng and V\u1ea1n Ki\u1ebfp, forcing Toghan to withdraw. Toghan returned without a huge loss of the army under him thanks to the Kipchak officer Sidor and his navy. The Yuan retreated back to China in June 9, 1285. ==Third Mongol invasion, 1287-88== Third Mongol invasion of Vietnam (1287-1288) ===Background=== In 1286, Kublai Khan appointed Tr\u1ea7n Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng's younger brother, Prince Tr\u1ea7n \u00cdch T\u1eafc, as the King of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t from afar with the intent of dealing with the uncooperative incumbent Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng. Tr\u1ea7n \u00cdch T\u1eafc, who had already surrendered to the Yuan, was willing to lead a Yuan army into \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t to take the throne. Kublai Khan cancelled plans underway for a third invasion of Japan to concentrated miltary preparations in the south. In October 1287, the Yuan land forces commanded by Toghon moved southwards from Guangxi and Yunnan in three divisions led by general Abachi and Changyu, while the naval expedition led by generals Omar, Zhang Wenhu, and Aoluchi. The army was complemented by a large naval force that advanced from Qinzhou, with the intent to form a large pincer movement against the Vietnamese. The force was composed of Mongols, Jurchen, Han Chinese, Zhuang, and Li troops. ===Campaign=== Wooden stakes from the Bach Dang river in Museum of Vietnam The Yuan were successful in the early phases of the invasion, occupying and looting the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t capital. In January 1288, as Omar's fleet passed through the Ha Long Bay, followed by Zhang Wenhu's supply fleet, the Vietnamese navy under prince Tr\u1ea7n Kh\u00e1nh D\u01b0 attacked and destroyed Wenhu's fleet. The Yuan land army under Toghan and naval fleet under Omar, both already in V\u1ea1n Ki\u1ebfp (today H\u1ea3i D\u01b0\u01a1ng province), were unaware of the loss of their supply fleet. Toghon returned back to the capital Th\u0103ng Long to loot food, while Omar destroying king Tr\u1ea7n Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng's tomb in Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh. Due to a lack of food supplies, Toghon and Omar's army retreated from Th\u0103ng Long to their fortified main base in V\u1ea1n Ki\u1ebfp (northeast of Hanoi) on 5 March 1288. They planned to withdraw from \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t but waited for the supplies to arrive before departing. As food supplies ran low and their positions became untenable, Toghon decided on 30 March 1288 to return to China. Toghon boarded a large warship for himself and the Yuan land force could not withdraw in the same way from which they came. Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o, aware of the Yuan retreat, prepared to attack. The Vietnamese had destroyed bridges, roads and creating traps along the retreating Yuan route. They pursued Toghon's forces to L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n, where in April 10, Toghon was forced to abandoned his ship, avoided highway and was escorted back to China by his few remaining troops through the forests. Most of Toghon's land force were killed or captured. Meanwhile, the Yuan fleet commanded by Omar were retreating through the B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng river. At the B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng River in April 1288, the Vietnamese prince Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o ambushed Omar's Yuan fleet in the third Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng. The Vietnamese forces placed hidden metal-tipped wooden stakes in the riverbed and attacked the fleet once it had been impaled on the stakes. Omar himself was taken as a prisoner of war. The Yuan fleet was destroyed and the army retreated in disarray without supplies. In 1288, the Yuan army engaged the Vietnamese army at the Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh River in a battle during which Toghan was struck by a poisoned arrow. Several thousand Yuan troops, unfamiliar with the terrain, were lost and never regained contact with the main force. An account of the battle from L\u00ea T\u1eafc, a Vietnamese scholar who defected to the Yuan in 1285, said that the remnants of the army followed him north in retreat and reached Yuan-controlled territory on Lunar New Year's Day in 1289. After three further months in \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t, the Yuan army were withdrawn before malaria season. ==Aftermath== ===Yuan=== As late as 1293, Kublai Khan planned a fourth military campaign to install Tr\u1ea7n \u00cdch T\u1eafc as the King of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t, but the plans for the campaign were halted when Kublai Khan died in early 1294. According to the book History of Yuan, the Yuan dynasty had mobilized up to 1 million people (troops, civilians) for the second and third invasion of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t and Champa. ===\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t=== The Tr\u1ea7n monarchs of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t decided to accept the supremacy of the Yuan dynasty in order to avoid further conflicts. In 1289, \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t released most of Mongol prisoners of war back to China, but Omar, whose return Kublai particularly demanded, was intentionally drowned when the boat transporting him was contrived to sink. In the winter of 1289\u20131290, the Tr\u1ea7n ruler Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng led an attack into modern-day Laos, against the advice of his advisors, with the goal of preventing raids from the inhabitants of the highlands. Famines and starvations ravaged the country from 1290 to 1292. There were no records of what caused the crop failures, but possible factors included neglect of the water control system due to the war, the mobilization of men away from the rice fields, and floods or drought. In 1293, Kublai detained the Vietnamese envoy, \u0110\u00e0o T\u1eed K\u00ed, because Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng refused to go to Beijing in person. Kublai's successor Tem\u00fcr Khan (r.1294-1307), later released all detained envoys and resumed their tributary relationship initially established after the first invasion, which continued to the end of the Yuan. The The Travels of Marco Polo describes Marco Polo's 1288 visit to \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t: > Caugigu [Giao Ch\u1ec9] is a province towards the east, which has a king. The > people are Idolaters, and have a language of their own. They have made their > submission to the Great Kaan, and send him tribute every year. And let me > tell you their king is so given to luxury that he hath at the least 300 > wives; for whenever he hears of any beautiful woman in the land, he takes > and marries her.

The initial Mongol goal of placing \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t, a tributary state of the Southern Song dynasty, as their own tributary state was accomplished after the first invasion. However, the Mongols failed to impose their demands of greater tribute and direct darughachi oversight over \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t's internal affairs during their second invasion and their goal of replacing the uncooperative Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng with Tr\u1ea7n \u00cdch T\u1eafc as the King of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t during the third invasion. Nonetheless, friendly relations were established and Dai Viet continued to pay tribute to the Mongol court.Simons, G. The Vietnam Syndrome: Impact on US Foreign Policy. Palgrave Macmillan; 1998 edition (October 27, 1997). p. 53. Walker, Hugh Dyson. East Asia: A New History. AuthorHouse (November 20, 2012). p. 242. Vietnamese historiography emphasizes the Vietnamese military victories. The three invasions, and the Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng in particular, are remembered within Vietnam and Vietnamese historiography as prototypical examples of Vietnamese resistance against foreign aggression. ==Notes== ==References== ===Sources=== * * * * *. * *. * * * ===Primary sources=== * * *Polo, Marco.
