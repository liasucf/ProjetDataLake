    "text": "Izhar Cohen (; born March 13, 1951) is an Israeli singer who won the 1978 Eurovision Song Contest. ==Biography== Izhar Cohen was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, and raised in Giv'atayim, to a family of singers of Yemenite-Jewish descent \u2013 Shlomo Cohen (the Great Soliman), Sarah Cohen, and Hofni, Pini, and Vardina Cohen. ==Singing and stage career== Cohen started to sing when he was a child and joined his father in his performances. At 18, Cohen joined the IDF's \"Nachal\" singers group. During the 1970s Cohen was one of the most played singers in Israel. Representing Israel, he won the 1978 Eurovision Song Contest with the group Alphabeta performing \"A-Ba-Ni-Bi\" with music by Nurit Hirsh and words by Ehud Manor. The title of the song is the Hebrew word \"ani\" (first person singular pronoun) expressed in the popular children language game \"Bet language\" (equivalent to \"Pig Latin\"). Cohen later represented Israel again (this time with an unnamed group of backing singers) at the 1985 contest performing \"Ol\u00e9, Ol\u00e9\" (music \u2013 Kobi Oshrat, words \u2013 Hamutal Ben-Ze'ev) where he finished 5th. He attempted to represent Israel again in 1982 and 1996 but did not win the national final. Cohen was an actor in the Haifa Theater, and today he is an owner of a jewelry shop. ==See also== *Music of Israel == References == ==External links== *https://web.archive.org/web/20170212014526/http://www.izhar-cohen.eu.pn/ *A-ba-ni-bi lyric with English translation *Ole ole lyric with English translation * *VIDEO: Eurovision 1978 - Israel - Izhar Cohen & Alpha Beta - A-ba-ni-bi - \u05d0-\u05d1-\u05e0\u05d9-\u05d1\u05d9 *Facebook page Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Israeli Jews Category:Israeli male singers Category:Israeli male stage actors Category:Israeli people of Yemeni-Jewish descent Category:Eurovision Song Contest winners Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants for Israel Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants of 1978 Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants of 1985 Category:Hebrew-language singers Category:Jewish singers Category:People from Givatayim ",
