    "text": "\"My Name Is Prince\" is a song by Prince and The New Power Generation. It is the second single from the 1992 Love Symbol album. The song is about Prince himself and his musical prowess. The rap sequence is performed by NPG member Tony M. Prince's vocals range from the low note of C3 to the high note of C6. The B-sides were \"Sexy Mutha\", a clean remix of \"Sexy MF\", and \"2 Whom It May Concern\", a preview of songs from the then-upcoming Love Symbol album. ==Critical reception== Dave Sholin from Gavin Report commented, \"Clever as ever and fuuunnky to the max, this track once again displays how versatile, creative and unpredictable Prince truly is, and why he must be considered musical royalty.\" ==Music video== The music video features Kirstie Alley as news reporter Vanessa Bartholomew and Lauren Green as a studio anchor.http://aleteia.org/2017/08/28/fox-news-lauren-green-shines-light-on- faith/http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/the-death-of-prince-reported-by-some- media-others-more-cautious/291248 In the video, fans are rioting to see Prince perform onstage. However, instead of performing onstage, he dances with his band in an alleyway while shooting his latest music video, wearing the outfit from the single's artwork (a police uniform and cap with chainmail obscuring his face), singing into a microphone in the shape of a gun, and inciting riots and general chaos. ==Track listing== ===UK 7\"=== #\"My Name Is Prince\" (Edit) \u2013 4:05 #\"2 Whom It May Concern\" \u2013 4:02 ===US 7\"=== #\"My Name Is Prince\" (Edit) \u2013 4:05 #\"Sexy Mutha\" \u2013 3:55 ===UK 12\" picture disc=== #\"My Name Is Prince\" (LP version) \u2013 6:38 #\"Sexy Mutha\" \u2013 3:55 #\"2 Whom It May Concern\" \u2013 4:02 ===UK CD1=== #\"My Name Is Prince\" (Edit) \u2013 4:05 #\"Sexy Mutha\" \u2013 3:55 #\"2 Whom It May Concern\" \u2013 4:02 #\"My Name Is Prince\" (LP version) \u2013 6:38 ===UK CD2=== #\"My Name Is Prince\" (Original Mix Edit) \u2013 8:06 #\"My Name Is Prince\" (12\" Club Mix) \u2013 8:11 #\"Sexy M.F.\" (12\" Remix) \u2013 7:34 ===US CD=== #\"My Name Is Prince\" (Original Mix Edit) \u2013 8:06 #\"My Name Is Prince\" (12\" Club Mix) \u2013 8:11 #\"My Name Is Prince\" (House Mix) \u2013 7:18 #\"My Name Is Prince\" (Hard Core 12\" Mix) \u2013 7:55 #\"Sexy M.F.\" (12\" Remix) \u2013 7:34 ===Japan CD maxi single=== #\"My Name Is Prince\" (Original Mix Edit) \u2013 8:06 #\"My Name Is Prince\" (12\" Club Mix) \u2013 8:11 #\"My Name Is Prince\" (House Mix) \u2013 7:18 #\"My Name Is Prince\" (Hard Core 12\" Mix) \u2013 7:55 #\"Sexy M.F.\" (12\" Remix) \u2013 7:34 #\"Sexy Mutha\" \u2013 3:55 #\"Sexy M.F.\" (Clean version) \u2013 5:24 #\"2 Whom It May Concern\" \u2013 4:02 ==Chart performance== \"My Name Is Prince\" returned Prince and The NPG to radio and the Top 40 in the US after their previous single, the provocative \"Sexy MF\" failed to chart on any airplay charts. \"My Name Is Prince\" received modest airplay on Mainstream Urban and Rhythmic radio stations, earning respectable positions of number 25 on the R&B;/Hip-Hop chart, number 20 on the Rhythmic Top 40, and number 36 on the Hot 100.
