As a founding member of the Toronto School of Theology, students can avail themselves of the wide range of courses from Canada's largest ecumenical consortium. Wycliffe College trains those pursuing ministry in the church and in the world, as well as those preparing for academic careers of scholarship and teaching. ==History== Old postcard depicting Wycliffe College In response to the Liberal Catholic perspective of Trinity College, which is the Toronto diocesan seminary, the Church Association of the Diocese of Toronto, a lay evangelical group at the Cathedral Church of St. James, founded the independent Protestant Episcopal Divinity School in 1877 to provide an alternative source for evangelical and low-church theological training. Like its Oxford counterpart, Wycliffe Hall, the name Wycliffe College was inspired by John Wycliffe, a 14th-century English scholastic philosopher, theologian, biblical translator, and reformer. The name was given first to the college's building and then to the college itself. To ensure its long-term viability, Wycliffe College began considering various forms of union with the University of Toronto towards the end of the 19th century. Wycliffe College became affiliated with the University of Toronto in 1885 and federated in 1889. Wycliffe College had a close association with the Anglican Church of the Epiphany in Parkdale. The church's founding rector, Bernard Bryan, had been one of the nine men who constituted the first class at Wycliffe in 1877. This connection continued in 1959 when the Church of the Epiphany's rector, Leslie Hunt, was appointed Principal of Wycliffe College.

Northern facade of the main building In 1969, the Toronto School of Theology (TST) was created as an independent federation of seven schools of theology, including the divinity faculties of Wycliffe College. Within its own federation, the University of Toronto granted degrees except theology or divinity degrees. Since 1978, by virtue of a change made in its charter, the University of Toronto has granted theology degrees conjointly with Wycliffe College and other TST member institutions. An act respecting Wycliffe College, being chapter 112 of the Statutes of Ontario, 1916, was repealed and the Wycliffe College Act, 2002 was substituted.http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/source/private/english/2002/elaws_src_private_pr02001_e.htm Wycliffe College Act, 2002, S.O. 2002, c.
