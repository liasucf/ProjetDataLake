    "text": "The Adventures of Robby Roto! (Robby Roto for short) is a 1981 arcade game produced by Bally/Midway. In Robby Roto, the player digs through a dirt-filled maze collecting items while avoiding pursuing creatures. It is one of the few games made available to legally download on the official website of MAME, a video game emulator. ==Reception== Robby Roto sold fewer than 2,000 units and was much less popular than 1982's Dig Dug. Co-developer Dave Nutting claimed, \"it was a very complex game and those who played it found themselves on the defensive--most were intimidated. Gamers like to be aggressive.\" ==References== ==External links== * *MAME download page Category:1981 video games Category:Maze games Category:Midway video games Category:Arcade games Category:Arcade-only games Category:Video games developed in the United States ",
