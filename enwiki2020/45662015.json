    "text": "Quigley's Castle is a historic house museum and garden at 274 Quigley Castle Road, off Arkansas Highway 23 south of Eureka Springs, Arkansas, and is one of the most unusual houses in northwestern Arkansas. The house was designed by Elise Quigley and built in 1943 by Albert Quigley and a neighbor, using lumber from the property. The exterior of the house is decorated with the collection of rocks Elise Quigley had accumulated since childhood. The house was specifically designed by Quigley to accommodate a two-story space for tropical plants. Over the years Elise Quigley's gardens expanded to take over much of the property. In 1950 the family began charging admission to tour the home, a practice that continues today. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Carroll County, Arkansas ==References== ==External links== *Quigley's Castle web site Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1943 Category:Houses in Carroll County, Arkansas Category:Museums in Carroll County, Arkansas Category:Historic house museums in Arkansas Category:Buildings and structures in Eureka Springs, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Carroll County, Arkansas ",
