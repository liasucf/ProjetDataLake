    "text": "The Fox Ministry was the second responsible government to be formed in New Zealand. It formed in 1856, but lasted less than a month, from 20 May to 2 June 1856. From the outset, William Fox served as Prime Minister as well as Attorney-General. ==Background== Fox was the leader of a 'Wellington Party' of provincial supporters in opposition to the government of Henry Sewell during the 1856 session of Parliament. He moved resolutions which led to the Sewell Ministry's demise. Fox subsequently formed a new ministry at the Governor's invitation. His provincial policies were seen as too extreme for many members, particularly from Auckland. Fox remained much respected in Wellington though had few supporters elsewhere. His administration lasted only weeks and it was not long before he in turn was succeeded by a more centrist, long-lasting administration led by Edward Stafford, which governed until 1861. ==Ministers== The following members served on the Fox Ministry: {|border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" width=60% |- !Name !Image !Office !Term |- | rowspan=2 | William Fox | rowspan=2 | 75px | Member of Executive Council | rowspan=2 | 20 May 1856 \u2013 2 June 1856 |- | Attorney-General |- | rowspan=2 | John Hall | rowspan=2 | 75px | Member of Executive Council | rowspan=2 | 20 May 1856 \u2013 2 June 1856 |- | Colonial Secretary |- | rowspan=2 | Charles Brown | rowspan=2 | 75px | Member of Executive Council | rowspan=2 | 20 May 1856 \u2013 2 June 1856 |- | Colonial Treasurer |- | William Daldy | 75px | Member of Executive Council | 20 May 1856 \u2013 2 June 1856 |- | Ralph Richardson | 75px | Member of Executive Council | 24 May 1856 \u2013 2 June 1856 |- | Robert Wynyard | 75px | Member of Executive Council | 24 May 1856 \u2013 2 June 1856 |} ==Notes== ==References== * ==See also== * Government of New Zealand Category:Governments of New Zealand Category:19th century in New Zealand Category:1856 establishments in New Zealand Category:1856 disestablishments in New Zealand Category:Cabinets established in 1856 Category:Cabinets disestablished in 1856 ",
