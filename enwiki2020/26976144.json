    "text": "Fort Apache Napoli () is a 2009 Italian biographical film directed by Marco Risi about the fight against the Camorra and subsequent assassination of journalist Giancarlo Siani, played by Libero De Rienzo. ==Plot== The film tells the story of Giancarlo Siani, a young Neapolitan journalist who works in the editorial room of Il Mattino in Torre Annunziata. He works the crime beat (cronaca nera). While writing about crimes and murders by the Camorra, Siani begins to investigate the Camorra's alliances with the politicians of Torre Annunziata, and to discover large areas of corruption and collusion between politicians and organized crime. Despite the somewhat veiled threats of the local political class, Siani continues his inquiries, especially after the \"massacre of the circle of fishermen\". His articles particularly annoy the local Camorra bosses because they undermine their political and criminal alliances. So, after he was transferred to Naples by his paper, the Camorra meet, and decide to kill, Siani. Siani is shot outside his girlfriend's house, in the residential district of Vomero, on 23 September 1985. Siani was only 26. ==Cast== ==Soundtrack== The soundtrack includes the following tracks: *Ogni Volta - Vasco Rossi *La torre di Babele - Edoardo Bennato *Tu ca nun chiagne - Ciro Capano *Pe' sempre - Ciro Capano *O bene mio - Ciro Capano *Napule e - Pino Daniele *Jesce sole - R.
