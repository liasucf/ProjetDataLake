    "text": "On March 9, 2004, an attack on a restaurant in the Kartal district of Istanbul, Turkey killed H\u00fcseyin Kurug\u00f6l, a waiter in the restaurant, and injured five others. The two Islamic militants who carried out the attack, Engin Vural and Nihat Do\u011fruel, were holding automatic weapons and had ten homemade pipe bombs strapped to their flak jackets when they entered the restaurant frequented by freemasons. Shooting the guard in his feet, they entered the dining hall and began firing at the forty people in the room. Then they detonated bombs at the entrance, killing Kurug\u00f6l. One of the militants died in the attack, the other was seriously injured. This attack occurred 911 days after 9/11. On March 11, the newspaper Al-Quds Al-Arabi received a statement which claimed that an al-Qaeda affiliated group, Jund al-Quds, ('Soldiers of Jerusalem'), had carried out the attack. The statement's primary purpose was to claim responsibility for the March 11, 2004 Madrid attacks. In August 2004, the trial of the suspects began. While Turkish authorities said there was likely an al-Qaeda link, the surviving bomber, Engin Vural, claimed it was an independent act he planned along with the dead bomber, Nihat Do\u011fruel. The prosecution charged that a man named Adem \u00c7etinkaya, who was also charged, organized the attack and was also planning to bomb a private television station. ==References== ==External links== * Raid On Mason Lodge: They Were To Be Burnt, in H\u00fcrriyet 11 March 2004 * * A list of Engin Vural news on Turkish media * https://web.archive.org/web/20080628212915/http://www.barobirlik.org.tr/calisma/basinda_yargi/2004/03/16.htm * https://web.archive.org/web/20120208115823/http://www.mehmetfarac.com/belge.asp?select=254 Attack on Istanbul restaurant Attack on Istanbul restaurant Category:2000s in Istanbul Category:Attacks on restaurants in Asia Category:Attacks on restaurants in Europe Attack on Istanbul restaurant Attack on Istanbul restaurant Category:March 2004 crimes Category:March 2004 events in Asia Category:Murder in Istanbul Category:Terrorist incidents in Istanbul Istanbul restaurant Category:Explosions in Istanbul ",
