    "text": "The Panometer Leipzig The Leipzig Panometer is an attraction in Leipzig, Germany. It is a visual panorama displayed inside a former gasometer, accompanied by a thematic exhibition. The current theme is \"Carolas Garten\". The Panometer was created in 2003 by the Austrian-born artist Yadegar Asisi, who coined the name as a portmanteau of \"panorama\" and \"gasometer\". He opened another Panometer in Dresden in 2006. His panoramas are also displayed in Berlin, Pforzheim, Wittenberg, Hanover and Rouen.Official homepage ==Building== The Leipzig Panometer occupies a disused telescopic gas holder in Connewitz. The gasometer was built in 1909, under Hugo Licht, and was in operation until 1977. It has a diameter of and a total height of , including the cupola with lantern. From 2002 to 2005 it was renovated to allow the transformation into Asisi's panoramic display. The final step was the addition of a glass foyer, which connects it to an adjacent gasometer and also contains the restaurant.Gasbeh\u00e4lter (Gasometer) und Gaswerke in Deutschland Oliver Fr\u00fchsch\u00fctz. ==Panorama and exhibition== So far the panoramic pictures have been in circumference and around in height, making them currently the largest such pictures in the world. (The one in Dresden is slightly less tall.) Digital technology is used to combine photos, drawings and paintings into a single large picture file, which is then printed onto individual strips of textile. The strips are combined into a circular picture which is then hung up as a single piece. The panorama is viewed from a raised platform in the centre. Perspective distortion is used to create an impression of space. There are also light and sound effects, including a simulated day-night cycle, sounds from nature, and music composed especially by the Belgian composer Eric Babak In the area between the panorama and the outer wall there is an exhibition on a theme related to the picture (currently the Titanic), as well as a film viewing room. ==Themes== 2003\u201305: Mount Everest. The viewer's vantage point was from the Valley of Silence. The accompanying exhibition showed the history of Western journeys to Everest on one side of the building, and the viewpoint of local Buddhist inhabitants on the other. This included a mandala made from coloured sand and a stupa constructed in Nepal (both sacred artworks).Asisi Panometer \u2013 \u00bb8848Everest360\u00b0\u00ab The pilot project 2005\u201309: Ancient Rome. A recreation of an 1889 panorama of Rome by Alexander von Wagner, portraying Constantine the Great's entry into the city following his success in the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312. The exhibition covered the day-to-day life and architecture of Ancient Rome, and featured plaster casts from the University of Leipzig's antiques collection along with paintings, architectural drawings and models of famous Roman buildings. It included a reconstruction of the partly destroyed, high Colossus of Constantine, rebuilt as an anamorphosis (a kind of visual illusion). Since December 2014 this panorama and the colossus are displayed in the Pforzheim Gasometer.Gasometer Pforzheim 2009\u201313: Amazonia. This was made to honour the 150th anniversary of the death of Alexander von Humboldt, the German naturalist who explored South America. The panorama shows a diverse and detailed image of the flora and fauna of the rainforest, in which some smaller animals are only visible with a telescope. The sound and light effects include animal calls and a simulated tropical rainstorm. Humboldt had expressed his desire for a panorama which would \"show nature in its wild luxuriance and the fullness of life\".AMAZONIA \u2013 Yadegar Asisi\u2018s magical picture of nature The exhibition includes a large model (60:1) of a mosquito. 2013-2015: Leipzig 1813.
