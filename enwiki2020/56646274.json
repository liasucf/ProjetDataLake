In 2015 Bangladesh Anti Corruption Commission filled 56 cases regarding the corruption in the bank. According to Bangladesh Bank, 45 billion taka in total was embezzled from the bank from 2010 to 2013, during the chairmanship of Bachchu. In July 2017 Bangladesh High Court ordered Bangladesh Anti Corruption Commission to investigate his alleged role in the Basic Bank scam. He was interrogated by Bangladesh Anti Corruption Commission on 5 December 2017 for the first time since the cases were filled. He was interrogated by the Commission again on 8 January 2018. According to the investigation of Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit in 2014, 200 million taka was transferred from firms that received fraudulent loans from Basic Bank to the accounts of the younger brother of Bachchu. Bachchu's younger brother, Sheikh Shariar Panna, used to help arrange loans from the bank while talking a large percentage of the loans as \"consultancy fees\". The Finance Minister of Bangladesh, Abul Maal Abdul Muhith, said that massive embezzlement took place in Basic Bank and that Bachchu was responsible for it. ==References== Category:Bangladesh Jatiya Party politicians Category:Living people Category:Bangladeshi bankers Category:4th Jatiya Sangsad members Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
