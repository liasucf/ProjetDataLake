The first associations were founded in 1974, and their number then increased to reach 170 today. Most of them manage local fair trade shops (also called worldshops), but their tasks include also awareness raising activities, and educational interventions in schools. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Artisans du Monde, a non-profit federation of all the local associations based in Paris, represents them and coordinates their activities. It owns the majority of the capital of Solidar'Monde, a fair trade corporation which provides most of the products sold in the local shops of the Artisans du Monde network. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Artisans du Monde is a member of the French Plate-forme fran\u00e7aise pour le commerce \u00e9quitable, and of the World Fair Trade Organization. == External links == * Website of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Artisans du Monde Category:Fair trade organizations Category:Organizations established in 1974 ",
