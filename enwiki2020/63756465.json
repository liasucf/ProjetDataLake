    "text": "Devastator is the fifth studio album by American rock band Phantom Planet. It was released on June 18, 2020 by Gong Records and preceded by the singles \"Balisong\", \"Party Animal\", \"Time Moves On\" and \"Only One\". This is their first studio album in 12 years since Raise the Dead (2008). The album was originally scheduled to be released on May 8, 2020, but was pushed back to June 19, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The release was later moved up one day earlier, as a sign of respect to the Black Lives Matter movement so it would not fall on the same day as Juneteenth. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits for Devastator adapted from Discogs. ===Musicians=== ;Phantom Planet *Alex Greenwald \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar *Sam Farrar \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals *Darren Robinson \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals *Jeff Conrad \u2013 drums ===Production=== *Tony Berg \u2013 producer *Patricia Sullivan \u2013 mastering *Shawn Everett - mixing *Will Maclellan - Engineer, Mixing *Joseph Lorge - Engineer, Mixing * ==References== Category:2020 albums Category:Phantom Planet albums Category:Albums postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic ",
