    "text": "Dakar (; ; ) is the capital and largest city of Senegal. The city of Dakar proper has a population of 1,030,594, whereas the population of the Dakar metropolitan area is estimated at 2.45 million. The area around Dakar was settled in the 15th century. The Portuguese established a presence on the island of Gor\u00e9e off the coast of Cap-Vert and used it as a base for the Atlantic slave trade. France took over the island in 1677. Following the abolition of the slave trade and French annexation of the mainland area in the 19th century, Dakar grew into a major regional port and a major city of the French colonial empire. In 1902, Dakar replaced Saint-Louis as the capital of French West Africa. From 1959 to 1960, Dakar was the capital of the short- lived Mali Federation. In 1960, it became the capital of the Independent Republic of Senegal. ==History== The Cap-Vert peninsula was settled no later than the 15th century, by the Lebou people, an aquacultural ethnic group related to the neighboring Wolof and Serer. The original villages\u2014Ouakam, Ngor, Yoff and Hann\u2014still constitute distinctively Lebou neighborhoods of the city today. In 1444, the Portuguese reached the Bay of Dakar, initially as slave-raiders.Dinis Dias doubled Cap-Vert in 1444, but it is unclear if he sailed into the bay itself. \u00c1lvaro Fernandes anchored at the uninhabited island of Goree and lured and captured two natives off a Lebou fishing canoe before being driven off. The large slaving fleet of Lan\u00e7arote de Freitas anchored in the bay, but their attempts to reach the mainland shore were fended off by missile fire and took no captives. The subsequent fleets of Est\u00eav\u00e3o Afonso (1446) and Valarte (1447) stopped briefly at Goree, but were also fended off the shores and took no captives. In the aftermath, Prince Henry the Navigator suspended all Portuguese expeditions beyond Cap-Vert for nearly a decade. There are no more recorded attempts until contact was made in 1456. (As reported in the 1453 chronicle of Gomes Eanes de Zurara)B.W. Diffie and G.D. Winius (1977) Foundations of the Portuguese empire, 1415-1580 Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, pp.83-85A. Teixeira da Mota (1946) \"A descoberta da Guin\u00e9\", Boletim cultural da Guin\u00e9 Portuguesa, Vol. 1. No. 2 (Apr), p. 273-326. Peaceful contact was finally opened in 1456 by Diogo Gomes, and the bay was subsequently referred to as the \"Angra de Bezeguiche\" (after the name of the local ruler).A. Teixeira da Mota (1968) \"Ilha de Santiago e Angra de Bezeguiche, escalas da carreira da India\", Do tempo e da historia, Lisbon, v.3, pp.141-49. The bay of \"Bezeguiche\" would go on to serve as a critical stop for the Portuguese India Armadas of the early 16th century, where large fleets would routinely stop, both on their outward and return journeys from India, to repair, collect fresh water from the rivulets and wells along the Cap-Vert shore and trade for provisions with the local people for their remaining voyage. (It was famously during one of these stops, in 1501, where the Florentine navigator Amerigo Vespucci began to construct his \"New World\" hypothesis about America.Vespucci's letter from Bezeguiche is reproduced in F.A. de Varnhagen (1865) Amerigo Vespucci, pp.78-82.) The Portuguese eventually founded a settlement on the island of Gor\u00e9e (then known as the island of Bezeguiche or Palma), which by 1536 they began to use as a base for slave exportation. The mainland of Cap-Vert, however, was under control of the Jolof Empire, as part of the western province of Cayor which seceded from Jolof in its own right in 1549. A new Lebou village, called Ndakaaru, was established directly across from Gor\u00e9e in the 17th century to service the European trading factory with food and drinking water. Gor\u00e9e was captured by the United Netherlands in 1588, which gave it its present name (spelled Goeree, after Goeree-Overflakkee in the Netherlands). The island was to switch hands between the Portuguese and Dutch several more times before falling to the English under Admiral Robert Holmes on January 23, 1664, and finally to the French in 1677. Though under continuous French administration since, m\u00e9tis families, descended from Dutch and French traders and African wives, dominated the slave trade. The infamous \"House of Slaves\" was built at Gor\u00e9e in 1776. In 1795, the Lebou of Cape Verde revolted against Cayor rule. A new theocratic state, subsequently called the \"Lebou Republic\" by the French, was established under the leadership of the Diop, a Muslim clerical family originally from Koki in Cayor. The capital of the republic was established at Ndakaaru. In 1857 the French established a military post at Ndakaaru (which they called \"Dakar\") and annexed the Lebou Republic, though its institutions continued to function nominally. The Serigne (also spelled S\u00ebri\u00f1, \"Lord\") of Ndakaaru is still recognized as the traditional political authority of the Lebou by the Senegalese State today. The slave trade was abolished by France in February 1794. However, Napoleon reinstated it in May 1802, then finally abolished it permanently in March 1815. Despite Napoleon's abolition, a clandestine slave trade continued at Gor\u00e9e until 1848, when it was abolished throughout all French territories. To replace trade in slaves, the French promoted peanut cultivation on the mainland. As the peanut trade boomed, tiny Gor\u00e9e Island, whose population had grown to 6,000 residents, proved ineffectual as a port. Traders from Gor\u00e9e decided to move to the mainland and a \"factory\" with warehouses was established in Rufisque in 1840. A public water well, 1899 Large public expenditure for infrastructure was allocated by the colonial authorities to Dakar's development. The port facilities were improved with jetties, a telegraph line was established along the coast to Saint-Louis and the Dakar-Saint-Louis railway was completed in 1885, at which point the city became an important base for the conquest of the Western Sudan. Gor\u00e9e, including Dakar, was recognised as a French commune in 1872. Dakar itself was split off from Gor\u00e9e as a separate commune in 1887. The citizens of the city elected their own mayor and municipal council and helped send an elected representative to the National Assembly in Paris. Dakar replaced Saint-Louis as the capital of French West Africa in 1902. Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 93 A second major railroad, the Dakar-Niger built from 1906\u20131923, linked Dakar to Bamako and consolidated the city's position at the head of France's West African empire. In 1929, the commune of Gor\u00e9e Island, now with only a few hundred inhabitants, was merged into Dakar. Dakar Entrep\u00f4t. ca. 1900 Urbanization during the colonial period was marked by forms of racial and social segregation\u2014often expressed in terms of health and hygiene\u2014which continue to structure the city today. Following a plague epidemic in 1914, the authorities forced most of the African population out of old neighborhoods, or \"Plateau\", and into a new quarter, called M\u00e9dina, separated from it by a \"sanitary cordon\". As first occupants of the land, the Lebou inhabitants of the city successfully resisted this expropriation. They were supported by Blaise Diagne, the first African to be elected Deputy to the National Assembly. Nonetheless, the Plateau thereafter became an administrative, commercial, and residential district increasingly reserved for Europeans and served as model for similar exclusionary administrative enclaves in French Africa's other colonial capitals (Bamako, Conakry, Abidjan, Brazzaville). Meanwhile, the Layene Sufi order, established by Seydina Mouhammadou Limamou Laye, was thriving among the Lebou in Yoff and in a new village called Camb\u00e9r\u00e8ne. Since independence, urbanization has sprawled eastward past Pikine, a commuter suburb whose population (2001 est. 1,200,000) is greater than that of Dakar proper, to Rufisque, creating a conurbation of almost 3 million (over a quarter of the national population). In its colonial heyday Dakar was one of the major cities of the French Empire, comparable to Hanoi or Beirut. French trading firms established branch offices there and industrial investments (mills, breweries, refineries, canneries) were attracted by its port and rail facilities. It was also strategically important to France, which maintained an important naval base and coaling station in its harbor and which integrated it into its earliest air force and airmail circuits, most notably with the legendary Mermoz airfield (no longer extant). In 1940, Dakar became involved in the Second World War when General de Gaulle, leader of the Free French Forces, sought to make the city the base of his resistance operations. The object was to raise the Free French flag in West Africa, to occupy Dakar and thus start to consolidate the French resistance of its colonies in Africa. The plan had British naval support when fighting alone against the Axis powers. However, due to delays and the plan becoming known, Dakar had already come under the influence of the German controlled will of the Vichy government. With the arrival of French naval forces under Vichy control and faced by stubborn defences onshore, de Gaulle's proposals were resisted and the Battle of Dakar ensued off the coast lasting three days September 23\u201325, 1940, between the Vichy defences and the attack of the Free French and British navy. The enterprise was abandoned after appreciable naval losses. Although the initiative on Dakar failed, General de Gaulle was able to establish himself at Duala in the Cameroons which became the rallying point for the resistance of the Free French cause.Winston Churchill, The Second World War, Vol 2 Book II Chapter xxiv `Dakar`.John Williams, The Guns of Dakar: September, 1940 (Heinemann Educational Books, 1976).Martin Thomas, \"The Anglo\u2010French divorce over West Africa and the limitations of strategic planning, June\u2010December 1940.\" Diplomacy and Statecraft 6.1 (1995): 252-278. In November 1944 West African conscripts of the French army mutinied against poor conditions at the Thiaroye camp, on the outskirts of the city. The mutiny was seen as an indictment of the colonial system and constituted a watershed for the nationalist movement. Dakar was the capital of the short-lived Mali Federation from 1959 to 1960, after which it became the capital of Senegal. The poet, philosopher and first President of Senegal L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor tried to transform Dakar into the \"Sub-Saharan African Athens\" (l\u2019Ath\u00e8nes de l\u2019Afrique subsaharienne), as his vision was for it. Dakar is a major financial center, home to a dozen national and regional banks (including the BCEAO which manages the unified West African CFA currency), and to numerous international organizations, NGOs and international research centers. Dakar has a large Lebanese community (concentrated in the import-export sector) that dates to the 1920s, a community of Moroccan business people, as well as Mauritanian, Cape Verdean, and Guinean communities. The city is home to as many as 20,000 French expatriates. France still maintains an air force base at Yoff and the French fleet is serviced in Dakar's port. Beginning 1978 and until 2007, Dakar was frequently the ending point of the Dakar Rally. ==Geography== View of Dakar from the International Space Station in 2011 It is located on the Cap- Vert peninsula on the Atlantic coast and is the westernmost city on the African mainland. ===Climate=== The Dakarois climate is generally warm. Dakar has an ocean-influenced hot semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: BSh), with a short rainy season and a lengthy dry season. Dakar's rainy season lasts from July to October while the dry season covers the remaining eight months. The city sees approximately of precipitation per year. Dakar between December and May is usually pleasantly warm with daily temperatures around . Nights during this time of the year are comfortable, some . However, between May and November the city becomes decidedly warmer with daily highs reaching and night lows a little bit above . Notwithstanding this hotter season Dakar's weather is far from being as hot as that of African cities inland, such as Niamey and N'Djamena, where temperatures hover above for much of the year. Dakar is cooled year-round by sea breezes. ==Administration == The city of Dakar is a commune (also sometimes known as commune de ville), one of the some 125 communes of Senegal. The commune of Dakar was created by the French colonial administration on June 17, 1887 by detaching it from the commune of Gor\u00e9e. The commune of Gor\u00e9e, created in 1872, was itself one of the oldest Western-style municipalities in Africa (along with the municipalities of Algeria and South Africa). The commune of Dakar has been in continuous existence since 1887, being preserved by the new state of Senegal after independence in 1960, although its limits have varied considerably over time. The limits of the commune of Dakar have been unchanged since 1983. The commune of Dakar is ruled by a democratically elected municipal council (conseil municipal) serving five years, and a mayor elected by the municipal council. There have been 20 mayors in Dakar since 1887. The first black mayor was Blaise Diagne, mayor of Dakar from 1924 to 1934. The longest-serving mayor was Mamadou Diop, mayor for 18 years between 1984 and 2002. The commune of Dakar is also a department, one of the 45 departments of Senegal. This situation is quite similar to Paris, which is both a commune and a department. However, contrary to French departments, departments in Senegal have no political power (no departmental assembly), and are merely local administrative structures of the central state, in charge of carrying out some administrative services as well as controlling the activities of the communes within the department. The department of Dakar is divided into four arrondissements: Almadies, Grand Dakar, Parcelles Assainies (which literally means \"drained lots\"; this is the most populous arrondissement of Dakar), and Plateau/Gor\u00e9e (downtown Dakar). These arrondissements are quite different from the arrondissements of Paris, being merely local administrative structures of the central state, like the Senegalese departments, and are thus more comparable to French departmental arrondissements. The Assembl\u00e9e nationale on the Plateau, the heart of old Dakar In 1996 a massive reform of the administrative and political divisions of Senegal was voted by the Parliament of Senegal. The commune of Dakar, whose population approached 1 million inhabitants, was deemed too large and too populated to be properly managed by a central municipality, and thus on August 30, 1996 Dakar was divided into 19 communes d'arrondissement. These communes d'arrondissement were given extensive powers, and are very much like regular communes. They have more powers than the arrondissements of Paris, and are more akin to the London boroughs. The commune of Dakar was maintained above these 19 communes d'arrondissement, and it coordinates the activities of the communes d'arrondissement, much as Greater London coordinates the activities of the London boroughs. The 19 communes d'arrondissement belong to either of the four arrondissements of Dakar, and the sous-pr\u00e9fet of each arrondissement is in charge of controlling the activities of the communes d'arrondissement in his arrondissement. Dakar Central Station The commune d'arrondissement of Dakar-Plateau (34,626 inhabitants), in the arrondissement of Plateau/Gor\u00e9e, is the historical heart of the city, and most ministries and public administrations are located there. The densest and most populous commune d'arrondissement is M\u00e9dina (136,697 inhabitants), in the arrondissement of Plateau/Gor\u00e9e. The commune d'arrondissement of Yoff (55,995 inhabitants), in the arrondissement of Almadies, is the largest one, while the smallest one is the commune d'arrondissement of \u00cele de Gor\u00e9e (1,034 inhabitants), in the arrondissement of Plateau/Gor\u00e9e. Dakar is one of the 14 r\u00e9gions of Senegal. The Dakar r\u00e9gion encompasses the city of Dakar and all its suburbs along the Cape Verde Peninsula. Its territory is thus roughly the same as the territory of the metropolitan area of Dakar. Since the administrative reforms of 1996, the r\u00e9gions of Senegal, which until then were merely local administrative structures of the central state, have been turned into full-fledged political units, with democratically elected regional councils, and regional presidents. They were given extensive powers, and manage economic development, transportation, or environmental protection issues at the regional level, thus coordinating the actions of the communes below them. ==Notable sites== Deux Mamelles seen from afar, with African Renaissance Monument on the left and Les Mamelles Lighthouse on the right The city of Dakar is a member of the Organization of World Heritage Cities, and contains several landmarks. One of the most notable is Deux Mamelles, twin hills located in Ouakam commune. The hills are the only high ground in the city, providing views of the entire area and sweeping views of the city. The first hill is topped with Mamelles Lighthouse built in 1864. The second hill has the newly completed African Renaissance Monument built on top, which is considered the tallest statue in Africa.Les Mamelles \u2013 Dakar's Breasts. Lonely Planets.

When it is time to eat a typical meal someone will say \"kay lekk\" which means 'come eat'. Everyone will come together and sit around the plate and eat with their hands. Some famous dishes include Cebbu J\u00ebn (Ti\u00e9boudienne) and Yassa. The etiquette of people in Dakar is very simple but very vital. To not greet someone upon sight is to portray rudeness and oftentimes ignorance. Due to French colonialism the children of Dakar have a unique school system. The school will get a break at about midday and return home to get some rest. Since the population is majority Muslim there are daily activities such as going to the mosque at noon prayer and attending the mosque on Fridays. Music has a big influence on the youth with famous artists like Daara J Family who use their voice to represent the problems in their communities. Dakar is home to multiple national and international festivals, like World Festival of Black Arts, Festival international du film de quartier de Dakar, Dakar Biennale. It was also the location of Taf Taf, an international artist residency program. ===Museums=== IFAN Museum of African Arts. *IFAN Museum of African Arts or Musee Theodore Monod *Henriette-Bathily Women's Museum *House of Slaves *Village des Arts *Parc Forestier et Zoologique de Hann, aka the Senegal Zoo *Museum of Black Civilisations *Dynamic Museum ==Sports== Sports club AS Douanes are based in Sicap-Libert\u00e9; they play in the Senegal Premier League and previously won the 2014\u201315 Ligue 1 (Senegal) season.
