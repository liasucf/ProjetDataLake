It was the first popular feminist women's magazine published in Turkey. ==History and profile== Kad\u0131nca was established in 1978. The first issue was published in December 1978. The founder and launch editor- in-chief was Turkish journalist Duygu Asena. Her tenure ended on 1 March 1992. Kad\u0131nca which was published on a monthly basis was modeled on British second- wave feminist magazine Spare Rib and American second-wave feminist magazine Ms. The target audience of Kad\u0131nca was Turkish women between the ages of 20\u201330 from middle and lower middle classes. Following its launch in 1978 Kad\u0131nca began to cover topics that were not common in Turkish media discourse, including abortion, unwanted pregnancy, birth control, problems of housewives and professional women, violence against women, female sexuality and marriage problems. It also featured interviews with women from the fields of literature and business. Over time the magazine became one of the most significant supporting media outlet for feminist movement in Turkey. The magazine argued that women should have economic independence and have equal rights in society and in marriage. In 1998 Kad\u0131nca folded due to financial causes. ==References== Category:1978 establishments in Turkey Category:1998 disestablishments in Turkey Category:Defunct magazines published in Turkey Category:Feminism in Turkey Category:Feminist magazines Category:Magazines established in 1978 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1998 Category:Magazines published in Istanbul Category:Second-wave feminism Category:Turkish-language magazines Category:Women's magazines published in Turkey ",
