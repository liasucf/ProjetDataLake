Writing for Nintendo Life, Morgan Sleeper gave Kamiko 9/10 stars, stating that the game \"Nails the feeling of general progression\" while praising the gameplay as making up for what little the game has to offer. He also enjoyed the fact that the three playable characters lent \"an entirely different flow\" to the game which \"helped extend the replay value of what is otherwise a very brief experience\". In his review for Nintendo World Report, Daan Koopman gave the game an 8/10. He called the game's retro aesthetic \"lovely\" and its flow \"grand\". He also noted the games \"slower moments\" that \"never really\" dragged the game down. Koopman also disliked the shortness of Kamiko, but felt that it \"absolutely owns up\" to its brief length.
