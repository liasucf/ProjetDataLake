His principal mediums are antler, horn, ivory, and bronze, from which he creates sculpture in his signature style, a juxtaposition of abstract organic and non-organic shapes, best seen in his moose skull sculpture \"Duality\". Originally beginning with other art forms which included drawing, acrylic painting and clay sculpture, his interest in antler carving was sparked in 1985 when he attended a show of antler carvings by Maureen Morris, a well-known sculptor from Atlin, British Columbia. After moving to the Yukon in 1987, Shane began experimenting with antler carving and found great creative and tactile potential in the medium. He has since worked in antler, bone, horn, mammoth tusk, stone, and now bronze. His bronze series entitled \"Skullpture\"http://www.skullpture.ca/ includes cast, carved skulls of moose, wolf, seal, grizzly and black bear, human and wolverine. Shane has taught the art of antler carving during Red Deer College's \"Series: Summer School of the Visual Arts\". ==The 2007 Canada Winter Games Torches== In 2006, Shane was commissioned to create three torches to be used in the pan-Northern Relay prior to the 2007 Canada Winter Games. Each torch was carved from a full caribou antler, and each was representative of one of the three Canadian Territories. ==The Great Antler Heist== On Saturday, September 15, 2007, Whitehorse, Yukon was hit by the \"Great Antler Heist\" or \"Yukon's Thomas Crown Affair\", as it was variously dubbed in the national media. During an unplanned, city-wide power outage at approximately 6:30 am, a thief or thieves broke into the Canada Games Center and stole the giant piece \"Yukon Seasons\", carved from a complete moose skull and antler set. It was the only item taken during the brazen robbery. On April 8, 2008 an anonymous person returned Yukon Seasons to the Whitehorse detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). The person was not associated with the theft, according to the RCMP spokesperson. Apart from some discolouration and a broken tine (recovered at the scene of the crime), Yukon Seasons was recovered intact. On December 2, 2008, the restored Yukon Seasons was unveiled to the public in its old home at the Canada Games Centre in Whitehorse, Yukon. Valery Monahan, a conservator with the Yukon Government, performed the restorative work on the sculpture. Yukon Government Minister for Tourism and Culture, Elaine Taylor and Whitehorse Mayor, Pam Buckway, were on hand for the opening and spoke at the event. Shane Wilson was also in attendance and thanked those who helped with the recovery and restoration of the sculpture. ==Shows== *Sculpted Dimensions Buckhorn Fine Art Festival, Buckhorn, Ontario, Canada, 2011 *International Year of the Forests Exhibition, Algonquin Art Centre, Algonquin Park, Ontario, Canada, 2011 *Art of the Commons, Wildlife Art Journal (online), Jan - Feb 2011 *Art of the Commons, Wildlife Art Journal (online), Spring 2010 *Instructors' Show - Series: Summer School for the Visual Arts, Red Deer College Library, Red Deer College, Red Deer, Alberta, Canada, 2008 *The Art of Change: Works from the Yukon Permanent Art Collection, Yukon Arts Centre Gallery, Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada, 2005 *Explore and Embrace a Special Wild Place, (Sponsored by The Wildlife Viewing Program, Yukon Government, in collaboration with the Yukon Art Society, Yukon Art Society Gallery, Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada, 2005 *The Vernacular of Robert Service Festival Show, MacBride Museum, Whitehorse, Yukon, 2005 *Tenth Anniversary Annual Robert Service Dinner: Commemorating the 100th Anniversary of Robert Service's Arrival in Yukon, \"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\", 2004 *The International Exhibitions of Sculptural Objects and Functional Art (SOFA) 2004, Accepted to attend with Portfolio as a member of Canada's Trade Mission, organized by the Canadian Consulate General in Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA, 2004 *Instructors' Show - Series: Summer School for the Visual Arts, Red Deer College Library, Red Deer College, Red Deer, Alberta, Canada, 2004 *Grand Opening Show, Yukon Artists @ Work Gallery, Whitehorse, Yukon, 2004 *Redism.com: A New Kind of Art Gallery: Virtual Art Competition and Gallery (sponsored by Bass Beer): First Place - Sculpture, 2003 *Yukon Arts Centre Gallery Tenth Anniversary Show, Yukon Arts Centre Gallery, Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada, June\u2013July 2002 *FNAWS - Foundation for North American Wild Sheep Convention, 2001, Reno, Nevada, USA, 2001 *Euroart 2000, Barcelona, Spain, (selected by Euroart 2000 to represent Canada), 2000 *New Beginnings, Odd Gallery - Grand Opening, Dawson City, Yukon, Canada, (Gallery and Show opened by Her Excellency, the Right Honorable Adrienne Clarkson, Governor General of Canada), 2000 *Convergence: The Exhibition of the 2000 Arctic Winter Games, Yukon Arts Centre Gallery, Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada, (Show opened by Her Excellency, the Right Honorable Adrienne Clarkson, Governor General of Canada), 2000 *Light, Yukon Arts Centre Gallery, Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada, 1999 *Northern Encounters '99: A Circumpolar Festival of the Arts,Toronto and Kleinburg, Ontario, Canada, 1999 *Love, Romance and Erotica, The Guild, Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada, 1999 *The Great Northern Arts Festival, Inuvik, NWT., Canada, 1998 *The Fireweed Festival, Faro, Yukon, Canada, (First Place: Carving, Fine Art), 1998 *Whitehorse International Airport, Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada (Ongoing display 1997\u20132001) *Yukon Native Products, Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada (Show and demonstration), 1996 *Arts-Fest 95, Faro, Yukon, Canada, 1995 ==Public collections and commissions== *The Four Seasons Hotel Toronto Contemporary Art Collection: \"Candle Ice Two\", 2012 *The Haines Junction Permanent Art Collection: \"Skullpture Series - Gaia, 2009\" (Donated in full by the artist), 2009 *The Yukon Arts Centre Gallery Permanent Collection: \"Self Portrait, 2009\" (Donated by Earl Bennett and the artist), 2009 *The Yukon Arts Centre Gallery Permanent Collection:\"Candle Ice, 1999\", 2008 *The Haines Junction Permanent Art Collection: \"Skullpture Series, 2007\" (Fourteen works in bronze, donated in full by the artist), 2007 *The Governments of Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut: Three Torches representing Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut (each Torch donated by the Canada Winter Games Host Society to the respective Territory for permanent display, 2007) *The Whitehorse 2007 Canada Winter Games: Three Torches representing Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut (Commissioned by Touch The North Inc. for donation to the Canada Winter Games Host Society, 2006) *The Yukon Permanent Art Collection: \"Yukon Seasons, 2003\" (Donated in full to the Yukon Permanent Art Collection by the artist, dedicated, with gratitude, to Ruth McCullough, for her hard work and singular dedication to fostering visual art and fine craft in Yukon, 2006) *The Yukon Hospital Foundation: \"Tundra Swan, 2007\" (commissioned as a symbol for the \"Under Our Wings\" Fundraising Campaign, 2005 *J.C.
