    "text": "Tevnia jerichonana is a species of giant tube worm in the family Siboglinidae, living in a unique deep-sea environment. These deep sea marine species survive in environments like hydrothermal vents. These vents give off gas and toxic chemicals with the addition of having superheated temperatures. The giant tube worm prefers environments such as these despite the harsh temperature and toxic sea water.Animalia (animals). (n.d.).

On the Vestimentifera, new phylum: Six new species, and other taxa, from hydrothermal vents and elsewhere. Bulletin of the Biological Society of Washington, 6: 117-158 ==Description== The giant tube worm lives inside a long narrow tube made from a chitin, that is the hard material of its outer skeleton, and it attaches to the ocean floor.Giant tube worm photo. (n.d.). Retrieved June 1, 2015, from http://www.arkive.org/giant-tube-worm/riftia- pachyptila/image-G78006.html It possesses a retractable plume that is extended when the worm is not disturbed. Its size can go up to tall. The plume is a complex structure that has tightly stacked sheets of tentacles forming a gill-like organ.Giant tube worm photo. (n.d.).

The plume also has blood vessels containing large amounts of haemoglobin, which gives the animal a blood-red colouration.Giant tube worm photo. (n.d.).

Hydrothermal vents arise when Earth's tectonic plates spread apart, where magma interacts with sea water to create an environment for certain types of microbes. T. jerichoana is spread eastern Pacific Ocean, particularly in the East Pacific Rise. They live in water depths between , as well as water temperatures of 1.82 to 2.89 degrees Celsius.Measurements and facts about Tevnia jerichonana - Encyclopedia of Life. (n.d.).
