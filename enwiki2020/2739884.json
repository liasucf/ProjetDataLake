Following ABC's LMA of WWCS from owner Birach Broadcasting, operations for the station moved from its transmitter building at 38 Angerer Road (Strang Lane) in Canonsburg to 400 Ardmore Boulevard in Wilkinsburg, the home of WEAE (ESPN Radio 1250) and WTAE-TV. Under ABC, the station carried Radio Disney. WWCS ceased to carry Radio Disney upon the expiration of ABC's lease of WWCS on December 31, 2010; the network's programming then moved to Disney-owned WEAE (renamed WDDZ), which disaffiliated from ESPN Radio. From January to February 2011, the station aired a music loop directing listeners to WDDZ. In February 2011, a Spanish music format began airing as a simulcast of WSDS from Detroit. The simulcast was replaced by Fox Sports Radio programming on January 1, 2012; the network was previously cleared in Pittsburgh on WBGG, which dropped it when it replaced WEAE as the area's ESPN Radio affiliate. It now carries SB Nation programming full-time. WWCS is programmed and operated by Birach Holdings Corp. by and through its chairman and CEO, Sima Birach Jr. ==References== ==External links== *540 simulcasting Spanish station WCS Category:Washington County, Pennsylvania Category:Birach Broadcasting Corporation stations Category:Former subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company ",
