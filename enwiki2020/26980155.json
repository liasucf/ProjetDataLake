Later Ekaette served in the Federal Ministries of Industries (1975), Information (1977\u20131979), Education (1979) and National Planning (1979\u20131983). He was secretary, Public Service Department and Head of Service (1984). He was director, External Finance at the Federal Ministry of Finance (1985\u201386).

In April 2007, his wife Eme Ufot Ekaette was elected senator for Akwa Ibom South on the People's Democratic Party (PDP) platform. On 24 December 2008 he was sworn in as Minister for Niger Delta Affairs. His appointment was criticized by the militant Joint Revolutionary Council, who said that he lacked the drive and leadership required, and questioned the sincerity and commitment of Yar'Adua in making this choice. Talking to oil company executives in February 2009, he said that the low level of development in the Niger Delta region and the crisis in the Niger Delta could have been avoided if the local people had received benefits from oil and gas development. He pointed out that in many cases workers had been brought in from other areas of the country, while locals suffered from pollution and lack of basic facilities. In March 2010 the Joint Revolutionary Council called for the removal of Ekaette for alleged duplication of development projects in the Niger Delta. A statement said among other things that \"Chief Ufot Ekaette is incompetent and unqualified to lead a ministry as sensitive as the Ministry of Niger Delta.\" ==References== Category:1939 births Category:Living people Category:Federal ministers of Nigeria Category:People's Democratic Party (Nigeria) politicians Category:Nigerian Permanent Secretaries Category:People from Akwa Ibom State Category:University of Ibadan alumni Category:King's College, Lagos alumni ",
