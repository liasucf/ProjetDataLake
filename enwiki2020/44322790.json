    "text": "19 Days in New York is a studio album recorded by ARIA award winning artist, Kate Ceberano. It was released in September 2004 and consisted entirely of cover versions of previously released material. ==Background== On 6 January 2004, Ceberano gave birth to her first child, a daughter named \"Gypsy\" before travelling to New York City to record 19 Days in New York. She says; \u201cNew York is a strong part of my musical dreaming. When I was a kid I always had ambitions to go to New York to either live, play music and be part of the musical scene. If I have lived in a past life, I am sure I would have lived there because I have such a fondness for the atmosphere. I love the fact they celebrate their artists, they embrace eccentricities, they have more patience and tolerance for not so ordinary artists. It made me feel completely relaxed and in my element.\u201d ==Singles== Although no official singles were released from the album, promotional videos for Higher and Higher and At Last were released late in 2004. ==Track listing== ==Credits== *Acoustic Bass: Wilbur Bascomb *Arranged By: George Bergold (tracks: 2, 7, 8) & Leonard Caston (tracks: 1, 3 to 6, 9, 10) *Backing Vocals: La Tanya Hall, Leonard Caston, Nicki Richards *Bass: Jonathan Sanborn, Victor Flowers *Drums: Buddy Williams, Reggie Flowers *Engineer: George Karras *Executive-Producer: Pierre Baroni, Ralph Carr *Guitar: Gerald Flowers, Lou Volpe *Mastered By: David Briggs, Steve Scanlon *Mixed By: Steve Scanlon *Piano: Eric Reed, George Pearson *Producer: Billy Davis, Leonard Caston * Exclusively licensed to Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
