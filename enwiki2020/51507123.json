Waves measuring 30 cm in height were recorded by tide gauges at East Cape and Great Barrier Island, and although the warning was later cancelled advisories remained in place for strong currents and abnormal sea level fluctuations. Power outages temporarily affected 300 homes near Rototahi and Waimata north of Gisborne while KiwiRail issued a precautionary shutdown notice for part of the rail network in Auckland. While no injuries or significant damage occurred, a spokesperson for the Earthquake Commission said they had received 48 claims for damage compensation by 4:30 pm local time on the day of the earthquake. Damage was localised to coastal towns near the epicentre of the earthquake, including in Te Puia Springs where Puketiti Homestead and Stable, a Category 1 historic building, suffered damage to a chimney and fireplace. == References == == External links == * Category:Earthquakes in New Zealand Te Araroa Te Araroa Category:History of the Gisborne District Te Araroa ",
