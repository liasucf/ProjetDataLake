    "text": "In enzymology, a cobalt-factor II C20-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cobalt-factor II \\rightleftharpoons S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + cobalt-factor III The two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and cobalt-factor II; its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and cobalt-factor III. This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one- carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:cobalt-factor-II C20-methyltransferase. This enzyme is also called CbiL. This enzyme is part of the biosynthetic pathway to cobalamin (vitamin B12) in anaerobic bacteria such as Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus megaterium. ==See Also== * Cobalamin biosynthesis ==References== * Category:EC 2.1.1 Category:Enzymes of unknown structure ",
