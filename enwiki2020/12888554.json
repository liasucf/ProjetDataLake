However, after the independence of India in 1948, his father decided they moved to Japan to take over his brother's business.

However it was a revelation to Wahba, who grew up in a multicultural community with a synagogue composed of Jews from all over the world, to realize that most American Jews at that time in the 1970s did not understand that a Jew could be of Middle Eastern/African heritage. Everything Jewish was defined by the Ashkenazi experience. The Eastern Jew did not exist except in the Torah. Wahba remains an activist, teaching that Jews are a multicultural people, that Yiddish was only one of many Jewish languages and dialects, including Judeo-Arabic and Ladino, and Jewish cuisine is equally international. Wahba serves on the Advisory Board of JIMENA (Jews Indigenous to the Middle East and North Africa). ==Works== She has published several anthologies relating to being a Mizrahi/Sephardi Jew of Egyptian and Iraqi-born parents and the indignities suffered by Jews who were forced into second-class (dhimmi) status in their homelands, as well as cultural dominance of the Ashkenazi Jews in countries like the United States, where it was difficult for her as she did not share their language, history or food, making it hard for her to identify with American Jews, which are overwhelmingly of Eastern European origin.A Measure of Community She has also published essays in psychoanalytic approaches to work with women and lesbians. ==Personal life== Rachel Wahba is also co-founder and co-owner (with her former wife, Judy Dlugacz), of Olivia Travel, a lesbian travel and resort company.
