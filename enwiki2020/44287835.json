Nanappan decided to dump the garbage in Sivaramapuram village with the support of corrupted politicians. Sivaramapuram is a village of calm and serene beauty where people living peacefully away from corruptions and pollutions. Ponnayya Thevar's family owned three-fourths of the land in Sivaramapura. Majority of the villagers were farmers doing agriculture by leasing land from Thevar. Thevar was always hungry for making money. Lalgudy manages to impress Thevar by agreeing a big amount as rental for giving space for waste disposal. Waste from the city starts flowing to Sivaramapuram.
