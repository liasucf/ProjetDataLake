Programming includes the UNLV Rebels football and men's basketball teams, ESPN Radio talk shows and play-by-play, and various local talk shows. Its studios are in the unincorporated community of Spring Valley in Clark County and its transmitter is in North Las Vegas. ==Station history== KWWN officially signed on in December 2007, and was running tests for several months on its transmitter. These tests were mainly to arrange the nighttime directional signal of the station, so it would not interfere with nearby KNZZ or other stations on 1100 kHz. While testing, the station ran at half power (10,000 watts day and 1,000 watts night) to further limit the possibility of interference. 1100 AM is a United States clear-channel frequency, on which WTAM in Cleveland, Ohio is the dominant Class A station. KWWN is currently running at its normal power.KWWN Update from Shortwave Blogspot.KWWN, an interview with Bill Croghan. Originally, KWWN simulcast sister station KBAD.
