    "text": "Slingshot is the 35th animated cartoon short subject in the Woody Woodpecker series. Released theatrically on July 23, 1951, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal International. ==Plot== A shooting contest (carrying a $1,000 prize) in a Western frontier town narrows itself down to two pretty sharp-eyed finalists: Indian Buzz Buzzard and his bow and arrow, and tenderfoot Woody Woodpecker. In Woody's hands, \"Slingshot \" is a weapon to be reckoned with. ==Notes== * There is no director's credit for this film. Lantz himself has claimed to have directed Slingshot , but does not receive on-screen credit. * Some of the animation at the tail end, where Woody begins walking away from the screen, was recycled from Puny Express. * There is no dialogue in the film. However, this entry marks the first performance of voice actor Dal McKennon in the Woody series, doing vocal effects for Wally Walrus, Buzz Buzzard, and a few for Woody as well (actress Grace Stafford provided Woody laugh and the rest of Woody sound effects in this film). McKennon would alternate with Stafford in providing Woody's vocal effects until 1954 (while she would perform his laugh and, starting in 1952, his dialogue), and eventually provided the dialogue voice for Wally and Buzz regularly in 1952, while mainly providing their vocal effects for the 1951 releases. Also, some dialogue from Woody is heard throughout the cartoon, although soon after the tree he pecks falls over, it turns out to be his thoughts. * The cartoon is a parody of the movie Winchester '73, released one year before. ==References== *Cooke, Jon, Komorowski, Thad, Shakarian, Pietro, and Tatay, Jack. \"1951\".
