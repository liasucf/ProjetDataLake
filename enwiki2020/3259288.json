    "text": "Cardinal Stritch University is a private Roman Catholic university in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Its motto, Ut probetis potiora (\"To value the better things\"), is taken from . Cardinal Stritch University enrollment as of Fall 2016 was 2,464. Tuition varies based on program; full-time traditional undergraduate tuition is $29,998 per year for the 2018\u201319 academic year. ==History== Cardinal Stritch University was founded in 1937 as St. Clare College by the Sisters of St. Francis of Assisi on Milwaukee's south side as an institution to help the order's sisters effectively train as teachers. The sisters opened a reading clinic in 1943 to help promote literacy in the area, still existing today as the Cardinal Stritch University Literacy Centers operating throughout the Milwaukee area. In 1946, the college was renamed Cardinal Stritch College in honor of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee's Cardinal Samuel Stritch. The college opened its programs to lay women for the first time and was subsequently accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools in 1953. Stritch established its first graduate program in 1956, offering majors in special education and reading. The university also opened its doors to men that year, becoming fully co-educational in 1970. Stritch moved to its current campus in the northern Milwaukee suburb of Fox Point in 1962. This new campus allowed the college to begin many new programs such as the nursing program in 1980 and its College of Business and Management in 1982. Cardinal Stritch College was renamed Cardinal Stritch University in 1997 with the university's first doctorate program offered the following year, the Doctorate in Leadership for the Advancement of Learning and Service. A $14 million expansion and renovation of the university occurred in 2006 with the introduction of online degree programs. ==Campus== In addition to campus, Cardinal Stritch University offers degree programs online. ===Campus=== The campus is located on a 40-acre campus 9 miles north of Milwaukee in the suburbs of Fox Point and Glendale.
