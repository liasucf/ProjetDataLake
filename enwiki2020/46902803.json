    "text": "Just days after the passing away of the great writer Octavian Paler, Daniel Cristea-Enache's latest volume, Conversations with Octavian Paler was published at Corinth Publishing House. The reviewer's novel is an atypical conversation because the author, of profound respect for Paler, let him unburden his soul, shed his replies at the addressed questions, in his own manner: by the grave, honestly and thoroughly touch of pen to the paper.Convorbiri cu Octavian Paler, by Dan C. Mihailescu, http://jurnalul.ro/cultura/carte/convorbiri-cu-octavian-paler-95670.html ==The book== The book is a conversation between generations, from November, 2005, when Octavian Paler had just been awarded the Opera Omnia of the Writers Union, to April, 2007, the last recorded day being the 29th of April, just days before the writer's passing away.Convorbiri cu Octavian Paler, by Andrei Rosca, http://www.bookblog.ro/altele/convorbiri-cu-octavian-paler/ Writing to the proximity of death, Paler thought about the search for life's meaning and the maturity of old age, as in the statement: \u201cUntil old age we don\u2019t have time to ask what is the meaning of life. We are too busy to live. At the old age we have time (even too much!) to do it, but then we face a painful discovery: life has meaning only if you\u2019re not looking for it!\u201d Conversations with Octavian Paler, by Daniel Cristea-Enache, Corinth, page 17 But this statement does not fade his love for life itself: \u201cTo love too much life is equal to no longer stand it.\u201d Conversations with Octavian Paler, by Daniel Cristea-Enache, Corinth, page 15 ==See also== * Octavian Paler * List of Romanian writers ==References== ==External links== * Convorbiri cu Octavian Paler Category:2007 books ",
