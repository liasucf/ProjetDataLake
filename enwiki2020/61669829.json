He explored the image of the Wehrmacht in newspapers and documentaries. To this end, he published a book called The Wehrmacht legend. Pollak spent five years as the head of anti- discrimination projects at the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA). In 2003 he started as a radio producer at the free Viennese radio station Orange 94.0 where he designed programs for the political magazine Radio Voice. Pollak received the \"Radio Prize of Adult Education\" for this work. In 2005, Pollak joined the European Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC), which in 2008 was transformed into the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA). Pollak acted as project leader for anti- discrimination projects. In early 2011 Pollak took over the position as spokesman and co-CEO of the Austrian human rights organization SOS Mitmensch.SOS Mitmensch-Sprecher: \u201eHadere keine Sekunde\u201c In: Standard. 21.
