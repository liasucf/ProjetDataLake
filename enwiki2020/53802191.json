    "text": "Finedon Cally Banks is a 2.5 hectare nature reserve north-east of Wellingborough in Northamptonshire. It is managed by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire. The site was formerly used to burn ironstone to remove impurities, leaving a layer of calcine, which produces poor soil in which wildflowers flourish. The reserve also includes a stretch of railway embankment for transporting the iron ore. Flora include common spotted orchids, great reedmace, kidney vetch and meadowsweet. There is access by a footpath from Harrowden Lane and along the railway embankment from Finedon. ==References== Category:Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire reserves Category:Finedon ",
