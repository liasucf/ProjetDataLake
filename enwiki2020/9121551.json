    "text": "Andr\u00e9 L\u00e9ri (1875 - 8 September 1930) was a French neurologist born in Paris. He studied medicine in Paris, where he was a student of Joseph Babinski (1857\u20131932) and Pierre Marie (1853\u20131940). In 1904 he obtained his doctorate with a dissertation on eye changes associated with tabes dorsalis. During World War I, L\u00e9ri was in charge of diagnosing soldiers with battle-inflicted neuroses. He was the author of works in the fields of neurology, ophthalmology and psychiatry, but is largely remembered for contributions made in osteology, particularly in his research of bone disorders. He described a type of mesomelic dwarfism combined with deformed forearms, which was to become known as L\u00e9ri-Weill dyschondrosteosis. With Pierre Marie, the \"Marie-L\u00e9ri syndrome\" is named, which is a hand disorder caused by osteolysis of the articular surfaces of the fingers. == Bibliography == * Spondylose rhizom\u00e9lique, Handbuch der Neurologie.
