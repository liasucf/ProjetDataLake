In 2010, Genocide Watch was the first organization to assert that the 1980s Gukurahundi massacres in Zimbabwe met the definition of genocide, calling for the prosecution of Zimbabwean leaders including president Robert Mugabe. In 2019, the organization issued alerts regarding the risk of genocide of the Muslim population in the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir and Assam. In 2020, the organization joined in signing an open letter by various rights groups urging the U.N. Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to investigate the actions of the Chinese government regarding Turkic Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region, and \"develop strategies\" to end the alleged violations which they consider to be acts of genocide. In the case of Bosco Ntaganda within the International Criminal Court investigation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Genocide Watch submitted amicus curiae observations along with the Antiquities Coalition and Blue Shield International, on the interpretation of attacks on cultural property in the Rome Statute. ==Publications== === Articles === * The Ten Stages of Genocide * See Other Articles by Dr. Gregory Stanton * QAnon is a Nazi Cult Rebranded by Gregory Stanton * Emerging paradigms in Genocide Prevention (with Andrea Bartoli and Tetsushi Ogata) ==References== ==External links== *The Call TEDx The Call *Biography at George Mason University website * *Bio at Armenian Foreign Ministry Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Oberlin College alumni Category:People from Fredericksburg, Virginia Category:University of Mary Washington faculty Category:American human rights activists Category:Yale Law School alumni Category:Harvard Divinity School alumni Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:Peace Corps volunteers ",
