Italy's first major new designs of the post\u2013World War II era, these ships were primarily designed for anti-submarine warfare tasks. Initially planned for three ships, the two ships that were constructed, and served until 1991 in both active and training capacities. The Andrea Doria class formed the basis for the larger that followed them. ==Design== Ordered in the 1957-58 Naval Programme, the Andrea Doria class were designed to operate the RIM-2 Terrier surface-to-air missile (SAM) system and Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King helicopters as both a platform for anti-air and anti-submarine warfare. The hull was based on the , with a length of and an enlarged beam to allow for the installation of a flight deck and hangar, measuring . The vessels had a draught of and displaced 5,000 tons standard and 6,500 tons loaded.Gardiner and Chumbly, p.204-205 The flight deck measured and was placed aft of the superstructure. It was cantilevered out at the stern to provide extra operational space. ===Power and propulsion=== The class was powered by four Foster Wheeler boilers. These provided the power to two double reduction geared steam-powered turbines creating which drove two shafts.Moore, p.258 This gave the cruisers a maximum speed of and an operating range of at . ===Armament=== For anti-air warfare the Andrea Dorias were equipped with one Mk 10 twin-arm launcher with 40 RIM-2 Terrier missiles placed forward. The ships were also provided with eight Oto Melara 76 mm/62 MMI guns to be used for point-blank anti-aircraft defence. The class was originally intended to be armed with the SMP 3 76 mm/62 gun found on the , however that gun was rated poorly and was replaced. The choice to arm the cruisers with the 76 mm guns was based on a decision taken in 1958 that only guns of that size were adequate in point blank air defence. The guns were placed in six single turrets amidships abreast the funnel and the bridge. The cruisers were also equipped with six Mk32 torpedo tubes in two triple mounts. These were for use against submarines. In conjunction with the torpedo systems, the Andrea Dorias could embark up to four helicopters. The Sea Kings were found to be too large for the class and the Italians instead chose to use Agusta-Bell AB 212 helicopters modified for anti-submarine warfare. ===Electronics=== Initially, the Andrea Doria class was equipped with SPS-12 and SPS-39A radars for air search and surveillance and SPQ-2 for navigation. They also carried SQS-39 sonar. The guns were automatically controlled by the Italian-designed NA-9 Orion fire control system guided by the SPG-70 radar. ==Ships== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=8|Andrea Doria-class cruisers |- !Name !Pennant number !Hull number !Builder !Laid down !Launched !Commissioned !Fate |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | || C 553 || 248 || CNR, Riva Trigoso || 11 May 1958 || 27 February 1963 || 23 February 1964 || Stricken 1991 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | || C 554 || 629 (777) || Castellammare di Stabia || 16 May 1958 || 22 December 1962 || 30 November 1964 || Stricken 1991 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | Enrico Dandolo || C 555 ||colspan=6 align=center|Cancelled |} ==History== The class consisted of two vessels both commissioned in 1964 and in service into the late 1980s. A third, Enrico Dandolo (C555), was cancelled. Andrea Doria was modernised in 1976-78, exchanging the RIM-2 missiles for the SM-1ER surface-to-air missile. The ship received an updated electronics package, mounting SPS-40 2-D air search radar, SPG-55C fire control radar and SQS-23 sonar. Caio Duilio received only a marginal modernisation in 1979-80 and instead was modified to become a training ship. Its aft hangar was removed and replaced with classrooms and two of its 76mm mounts were removed aft. In 1980 it replaced San Giorgio as the fleet's training vessel. Both ships mounted new electronic warfare packages, SPS-768 long-range search radars and SPR-4 intercept and SLQ-D jammers. ==Similar ships== * * * ==Notes== ==Sources== * Gardiner, Robert; Chumbley, Stephen & Budzbon, Przemys\u0142aw (1995).
