It is closely related to the parables of Salt and Light and Lamp under a bushel. ==Gospel accounts== ===Referring to himself=== In Jesus applies the title to himself while debating with the Jews and states: Jesus again claims to be Light of the World in , during the miracle of healing the blind at birth, saying: New Testament christology by Frank J. Matera 1999 page 235 :When I am in the world, I am the Light of the World. This episode leads into where Jesus metaphorically explains that he came to this world, so that the blind may see. In the Christological context, the use of the title Light of the World is similar to the Bread of Life title in where Jesus states: \u201cI am the bread of life: he who comes to me shall not hunger.\u201dChristology in Context by Marinus de Jonge 1988 page 147 These assertions build on the Christological theme of where Jesus claims to possess life just as the Father does and provide it to those who follow him.The person of Christ by Gerrit Cornelis Berkouwer 1954 page 163 The term \u201cLife of the World\u201d is applied in the same sense by Jesus to himself in John 6:51. ===Referring to his disciples=== Jesus also used that term to refer to his disciples in : This application of \"light compared with darkness\" also appears in which applies it to God and states: \"God is light, and in him is no darkness at all\".John by H. A. Ironside 2006 pages 199-202 ==Johannine Dualism== Examples of Dualistic concepts in the Gospel of John: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\" |- ! Light !! Darkness |- | Known || Unknown |- | Jesus Christ || Moses |- | Heavenly || Earthly |- | Above || Not Above |- | Spirit || Flesh |- | Sight || Blindness |- | Insiders || World |- | Day || Night |} *Light and Darkness ::Light and darkness in John\u2019s gospel is an antithesis that has symbolic meaning and is essential to understanding the author of John. The fourth gospel expresses certain ideas using the antithesis more frequently than any other writings in the New Testament. The Johannine community may have borrowed the symbolic use of the antithesis Light-Darkness from Essene literature, \u201cwhich considered History as a permanent conflict between Good and Evil, using Light as a symbol of Truth and Righteousness and Darkness as that of Falsehood and Evil\u201dTrocm\u00e9, E. (1995). Light and Darkness in the Fourth Gospel. Disdaskalia (Otterburne, Man.), 6(2), 3-13 The following are antithetical quotes from John: *Known and Unknown :*John 12:35 :::You are going to have the light just a little while longer.

Those who define darkness as sin also define light as good and righteous. However, in the Gospel of John light is never defined as righteous. Light is defined as life, as seen in John 1:4, \u201cIn Him was life; and the life was the light of men\u201d. Those have faith through Him will have eternal life. This \u201clife\u201d is a gift Jesus brought from God into a dying world. In John, \u201cdarkness is present in the absence of light; the absence of eternal life,\u201d and darkness referring to death, spiritually.Baylis, Charles P., \"The Meaning of Walking \"In the Darkness\" (1 John 1:6).\" Bibliotheca Sacra 149, no. 594 (1992). 219 Those who walk in darkness do not have eternal life because they are unknown to God. The only way to receive \"life\" is to be known of the light through God and his promises. ==Extra-biblical sources== In the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas, a used similar phrase appears, \"There is light within a man of light, and he lights up the whole world. If he does not shine, he is darkness\".Gospel of Thomas, 24 ==See also== * I am (biblical term) * Jesus in Christianity * Life of Jesus in the New Testament ==References== ==External links== * Category:Sayings of Jesus Category:New Testament words and phrases Category:Gospel of John World ",
