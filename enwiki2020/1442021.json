    "text": "Guinea elects on the national level a head of state\u2014the president\u2014and a legislature. The president is elected for a five-year term by the people through a two-round system (i.e. if no candidate secures a majority of the votes, there is a runoff between the top two vote-getters). The National Assembly (Assembl\u00e9e Nationale) has 114 members, elected for five-year terms, 38 members in single-seat constituencies and 76 members by proportional representation. Voters must be at least 18 years old and Guinean citizens in full possession of civil and political rights. Candidates must be at 18, either Guinean by citizenship or naturalized and resident in the country for at least 10 years. There are also various disqualifications. ==History== When Guinea gained its independence from France in 1958, Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 became its first president, as his Parti d\u00e9mocratique de Guin\u00e9e (DPG, Democratic Party of Guinea) had won 56 of 60 seats in the 1957 Territorial Assembly election. By 1960, he had declared the DPG the only legal party, so, for the next 24 years, all the voters could do was elect the DPG candidates to the National Assembly, while Tour\u00e9 ran unopposed for the presidency three more times. After Tour\u00e9's death in 1984, Colonels Lansana Cont\u00e9 and Diarra Traor\u00e9 seized power in a bloodless coup d'\u00e9tat, with Cont\u00e9 assuming the presidency. In December 1990, a new constitution created a unicameral Parliament. In April 1992, legislation was passed making Guinea a multi-party state. The following year, Cont\u00e9 announced a return to civilian rule, with Guinea's first multi- party presidential election taking place in 1993, followed by a legislative election in 1995. Cont\u00e9 remained president, with 51.7% of the vote, while his Party of Unity and Progress (PUP, Parti de l'Unit\u00e9 et du Progr\u00e8s) won 71 of the 114 seats in the Assembly. He was re-elected president in 1998, with 56.1% of the vote, and 2003, with 95.6% of the vote after all the major opposition leaders boycotted the election. His party also won 85 seats in the Assembly in 2002, with some opposition parties choosing to boycott. Shortly after Cont\u00e9's death in December 2008, Moussa Dadis Camara seized power. In December 2009, Camara was shot in the head in an assassination attempt and left the country to obtain medical care. The following month, Camara agreed to a return to civilian rule. No candidate won a majority of the votes in the first round of the 2010 presidential election, so Cellou Dalein Diallo and Alpha Cond\u00e9, the top vote-getters (with 43.69% and 18.25%, respectively), contested a second round, which was delayed several times. Cond\u00e9 finally emerged victorious, with 52.54% of the ballots. His Guinean People's Assembly party (RPG, Rassemblement du Peuple Guin\u00e9en) took 53 of the 114 Assembly seats in the repeatedly delayed 2013 election, and seven seats won by allies gave the RPG a majority. He himself was re-elected in 2015. ==Latest elections== === 2015 presidential election === Alpha Cond\u00e9 is re-elected. {| class=wikitable style=text- align:right !Candidate !Party !Votes !% |- |align=left|Alpha Cond\u00e9||align=left|Rally of the Guinean People||2,285,827||57.85 |- |align=left|Cellou Dalein Diallo||align=left|Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea||1,242,362||31.44 |- |align=left|Sidya Tour\u00e9||align=left|Union of Republican Forces||237,549||6.01 |- |align=left|Faya Lansana Millimouno||align=left|Liberal Bloc||54,718||1.38 |- |align=left|El Hadj Papa Koly Kourouma||align=left|Generations for Reconciliation, Union, and Prosperity||51,750||1.31 |- |align=left|Lansana Kouyat\u00e9||align=left|National Party for Hope and Development||45,962||1.16 |- |align=left|Ghandi Faraguet Tounkara||align=left|Guinean Union for Democracy and Development||19,840||0.50 |- |align=left|Marie Madeilein Dioubat\u00e9||align=left|Guinea Ecologists Party||13,214||0.33 |- |align=left colspan=2|Invalid/blank votes||179,804||\u2013 |- |align=left colspan=2|Total||4,131,026||100 |- |align=left colspan=2|Registered voters/turnout||6,042,634||68.36 |- |colspan=4 align=left|Source: CENI (98.2% of polling stations reporting) |} ===2020 legislative election=== The elections were boycotted by the main opposition parties.
