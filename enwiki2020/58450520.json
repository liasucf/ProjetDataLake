This situation has created tensions between the two sides, like the Battle of Qamishli (2016). == The clashes == The clashes erupted on 8 September 2018. According to Kurdish sources, the fighting took place after a Syrian government patrol consisting of three vehicles entered areas controlled by the Asayish, arrested civilians, and targeted their forces with light and medium weapons. They then responded to the attack. The Syrian government claims that the soldiers were on their way to the Qamishli Airport, which is under its control, when they were attacked. According to a source within the Syrian military, the soldiers that the Asayish targeted had previously prevented United States troops from entering Qamishli. The attack was believed to have taken place in retaliation for this confrontation with American troops. The clashes left 11 government soldiers killed and 2 wounded and 7 Asayish members killed and one wounded. == See also == * Battle of Qamishli (2016) * Rojava\u2013Syria relations == References == Category:Conflicts in 2018 Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War in 2018 Category:September 2018 events Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Syrian government Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Syrian Democratic Forces Category:Al- Hasakah Governorate in the Syrian Civil War Category:Battles of the Syrian Civil War ",
