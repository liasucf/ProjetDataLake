For the similarly named house in Virginia, please see Slaughter\u2013Hill House The Slaughter\u2013Hill Ranch, in Roswell, New Mexico, also known as Cunningham Homestead, Estancia Pavo Real, or the Canning Farm, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. It was the first homestead of Sam Cunningham, from Missouri, who built the hand-hewn log house. The building is the only surviving example of a hand-hewn log first homestead in the Roswell area. The ranch is significant also for association with C.C. Slaughter, a Texas cattleman who established a registered Hereford cattle herd here of national reputation. with After C.C. Slaughter died in 1919, ownership of the property eventually went to George Slaughter's daughter Eloise and her husband Curtis Hill, a lawyer. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Chaves County, New Mexico ==References== Category:Ranches on the National Register of Historic Places in New Mexico Category:Buildings and structures in Chaves County, New Mexico Category:National Register of Historic Places in Chaves County, New Mexico Category:Log houses ",
