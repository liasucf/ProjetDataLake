He has previously been the manager of the Zambian national team, with whom he won the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations; he also won the competition in 2015 Africa Cup of Nations with the Ivory Coast, becoming the first coach to win two Africa Cup of Nations with different countries. ==Playing career== Born in Aix-les-Bains, Renard played as a defender for French sides AS Cannes, Stade de Vallauris and SC Draguignan in a playing career which lasted from 1983 to 1998. After retiring as a professional player he worked as a cleaner, working there in the morning and training with Draguignan in the evening, eventually starting his own cleaning company. ==Coaching career== ===Early years=== Renard began his coaching career with SC Draguignan in 1999, leaving in 2001. He was Assistant at Chinese side Shanghai Cosco with head coach Claude Le Roy from 2002 to 2003, and managed English side Cambridge United in 2004, having first joined the club with Le Roy to serve as a coach. He became manager of Vietnamese club Song Da Nam Dinh in 2004, leaving them after several months. He became manager of AS Cherbourg in 2005, leaving them in 2007. He next became Assistant to Claude Le Roy for the Ghana national side. In May 2008, he was appointed manager of the Zambia national team. At the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations, he led Zambia to the quarter final stage of the tournament for the first time in 14 years.

He led the team to their first victory in the African Cup Of Nations in 2012. The win was dedicated to the 18 players who perished in April 1993, after a plane carrying the squad crashed just miles from the site of the 2012 final in Gabon. In May 2012, Chishimba Kambwili, the Zambian sports minister, announced he expected Renard to sign a new contract by the end of the month. After Zambia were eliminated from the group stages of the 2013 African Cup of Nations, Renard said that it was his fault. He later criticised CAF for not allowing Zambia, as the 2012 winners of the AFCON, the chance to compete at the 2013 Confederations Cup. Renard was released from his contract by the Football Association of Zambia in October 2013, in preparation for a role with French club FC Sochaux. ===Sochaux=== On 7 October 2013 it was announced that Renard was appointed as the new manager of French Ligue 1 side Sochaux. In April 2014 he was linked with the Morocco national job. The club was involved in a relegation fight in May 2014, and after being relegated, he left the club later that month. In July 2014 he was announced to be on the shortlist for the Ivory Coast job. ===Ivory Coast=== Renard was appointed as manager of the Ivory Coast national team in July 2014. He was manager at the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, and praised the organization of the tournament. He won the competition, becoming the first coach to win two Africa Cup of Nations with different countries. ===Lille=== Renard became manager of French club Lille in May 2015. On 11 November 2015, he was sacked after getting only 13 points in 13 league games. ===Morocco=== In February 2016, Renard was linked with the vacant Morocco national team job. Later that month he was appointed as the new Morocco manager. In October 2016 he was linked with the vacant Algeria national team job.

In July 2019 the Moroccan team was eliminated from the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, with Renard taking responsibility for the \"shock exit\". He resigned a few days later, on 15 July 2019. ===Saudi Arabia=== Later in July 2019 he became manager of Saudi Arabia, the first French to do so. On 10 September 2019, he managed his first official match against Yemen in the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification, which ended with a surprising 2\u20132 draw. ==Personal life== Renard is in a relationship with Viviane Di\u00e8ye, the widow of coach Bruno Metsu. ==Honours== ===As a manager=== Zambia *COSAFA Cup: 2013 *Africa Cup of Nations: 2012 Ivory Coast *Africa Cup of Nations: 2015 ==References== Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:People from Aix-les-Bains Category:Association football defenders Category:French footballers Category:AS Cannes players Category:SC Draguignan players Category:Ligue 1 players Category:French football managers Category:SC Draguignan managers Category:Cambridge United F.C. managers Category:AS Cherbourg Football managers Category:Zambia national football team managers Category:Angola national football team managers Category:USM Alger managers Category:FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard managers Category:Ivory Coast national football team managers Category:Lille OSC managers Category:Morocco national football team managers Category:French expatriate football managers Category:French expatriate sportspeople in England Category:Expatriate football managers in England Category:French expatriate sportspeople in Vietnam Category:Expatriate football managers in Vietnam Category:French expatriate sportspeople in Zambia Category:Expatriate football managers in Zambia Category:French expatriate sportspeople in Angola Category:Expatriate football managers in Angola Category:French expatriate sportspeople in Algeria Category:Expatriate football managers in Algeria Category:French expatriate sportspeople in Ivory Coast Category:Expatriate football managers in Ivory Coast Category:French expatriate sportspeople in Morocco Category:Expatriate football managers in Morocco Category:2010 Africa Cup of Nations managers Category:2012 Africa Cup of Nations managers Category:2013 Africa Cup of Nations managers Category:2015 Africa Cup of Nations managers Category:2017 Africa Cup of Nations managers Category:2018 FIFA World Cup managers Category:Sportspeople from Savoie Category:Cambridge United F.C. non-playing staff Category:2019 Africa Cup of Nations managers Category:Saudi Arabia national football team managers Category:French expatriate sportspeople in Saudi Arabia Category:Expatriate football managers in Saudi Arabia ",
