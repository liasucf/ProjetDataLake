To date, the character has been portrayed by eight child actors; Holly Bowyer, Rebecca Pike, Louisa Morris, Rachel and Sarah Corker, Madison Hampson, Amber Chadwick and Elle Mulvaney, making her the most recast character in Coronation Street. Although Amy's surname has stayed Barlow, Chadwick was credited as Amy McDonald for three episodes from 2009 to 2010.

Pike continued in the role until July 2005 when she was replaced with Louisa Morris. Morris departed two months later and the role was briefly taken over by twins Rachel and Sarah Corker for two episodes in September. Amy was once again recast later that month with Madison Hampson. Hampson quit Coronation Street in early 2006. Amber Chadwick was cast as Amy Barlow when Hampson departed with Chadwick first appearing onscreen in March 2006. Chadwick played the role until 2010 when the decision was made to recast Amy to tie in with the return of her onscreen mother Tracy. The casting of seven- year-old Elle Mulvaney was announced in March 2010. A spokeswoman said \"Amy has some big storylines coming up so we decided to recast an older child who could play younger. This is common practice. For example, Alex Bain is two years older than Simon is on screen.\" Mulvaney first appeared onscreen in May 2010. ==Development== ===Early development=== In April 2011, Tracy was accused of poisoning Amy: when Amy came down with a mysterious illness, Becky blamed Tracy. A source said \"Becky loves Amy and can't bear to see her suffering. She also can't bear seeing Steve and Tracy together. She is jealous and she quickly realises that Tracy is feeding off the attention Steve is giving them both. Becky can handle herself but Tracy is a dangerous enemy to make,\" the insider added. \"If Steve believes Tracy over Becky, it could signal the end of their marriage.\" In May 2011, Amy was diagnosed as being Lactose intolerant and Tracy found out that Amy had been drinking milk to make herself ill in order to make her parents nicer. Kate Ford said of Amy's actions \"[Tracy] catches Amy taking milk from the fridge. Amy drops the milk and locks herself in the front room and Tracy calls Steve round to coax her out. Amy tells them she's been making herself ill because then Steve comes round and her parents are nicer to each other...both she and Steve feel very guilty. They haven't behaved well and at times have forgotten that there's a child involved.\" In November 2015, it was announced that Simon would lash out at Amy at Christmas as part of Simon's domestic abuse plot, where he has been attacking his stepmother, Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson). A source said that \"The Barlows are going to be central to Coronation Street in the run up to Christmas. The close-knit family will be put under extreme strain and viewers will be left wondering if they can get through the turmoil.\" ===Teenage pregnancy=== Coronation Street producer Iain MacLeod said there are \u201cgreat things coming up at Christmas\" for \"the unlikely character\" Amy; speculation arose Amy could kill Tracy due to recent storylines and Amy's \"menacing nature in the past.\" In November 2018, it was reported that Amy would fall pregnant in a \"dramatic\" and \"scandal[ous]\" storyline that leaves Tracy and Steve in \"turmoil\" as they \"hit the roof\" and \"lose their rag\"; Amy's life will also be turned \"upside down\" as she seeks support from Liz. Duncan Lindsay from Metro said Amy's storylines \"don't come much more major than this\" as well as believing Mulvaney \"will be at the centre of some highly dramatic scenes.\" Lindsay also added that similarities will be drawn between Amy's teenage pregnancy and that of Sarah Platt's (Tina O'Brien) from 2000. ==Reception== During the May 2015 episodes, which saw a fire started by Tracy at the Victoria Court flats, Amy was one of the characters trapped in the fire. Duncan Lindsay for the Metro said of Amy's performance in these episodes \"The performances from Corrie acting titans such as Kate Ford [Tracy], Alison King [Carla] and Jane Danson [Leanne] always add to the drama, and young Elle Mulvaney, who plays Amy, is surely now a contender for next year's Young Performance prize at the British Soap Awards.\" For her portrayal as Amy, Mulvaney has been longlisted 3 times in 2010, 2011 and 2012 at the Inside Soap Awards for Best Young Actor. Mulvaney won the Best Young Actor award at The British Soap Awards 2017. In August 2017, Mulvaney was longlisted for Best Young Actor at the Inside Soap Awards. She did not progress to the viewer-voted shortlist. ==See also== *List of Coronation Street characters (2004) *List of soap opera recasts *List of soap opera villains ==References== ==External links== *Amy Barlow at itv.com Category:Coronation Street characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2004 Category:Child characters in television Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional bullies Category:Female villains Category:Fictional people from Manchester ",
