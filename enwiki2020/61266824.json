    "text": "There were multiple newspapers published in the Ottoman Empire. ==European influences== The first newspapers in the Ottoman Empire were owned by foreigners living there who wanted to make propaganda about the Western world.Stavrianos, p. 211. The earliest was printed in September 1795 by the Palais de France in Pera (now Beyo\u011flu), during the embassy of Raymond de Verninac-Saint-Maur. It was issued fortnightly under the title \"Bulletin de Nouvelles\", until March 1796, it seems. Afterwards, it was published under the name \"Gazette fran\u00e7aise de Constantinople\" from September 1796 to May 1797, and \"Mercure Oriental\" from May to July 1797.Groc & \u00c7a\u011flar, p. 6. Its main purpose was to convey information about the politics of Post-Revolutionary France to foreigners living in Istanbul; therefore, it had little impact on local population. In 1800, during the French occupation of Egypt, a newspaper in Arabic, al-Tanbih (The Alert), was planned to be issued, with the purpose of disseminating in Egypt the ideals of the French Revolution.Wendell, p. 143. It was founded by the general Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Menou, who appointed Ismail al- Khashab as its editor. However, there is doubt the newspaper was actually ever printed. Menou eventually capitulated after Alexandria was besieged by British forces in 1801. In 1828, Khedive of Egypt Muhammad Ali ordered, as part of the drastic reforms he was implementing in the province, the local establishment of the gazette Vekayi-i Misriye (Egyptian Affairs), written in Ottoman Turkish in one column with an Arabic translation in a second column (Ottoman Turkish text was in the right one and Arabic text in the left one). It was later edited in Arabic only, under the Arabic title \"al-Waqa'i` al-Misriyya\" (The Egyptian Affairs).Tripp (ed.), p. 2; Amin, Fortna & Frierson, p. 99; Hill, p. 172. The first official gazette of the Ottoman State was published in 1831, on the order of Mahmud II. It was entitled \"Moniteur ottoman\", perhaps referring to the French newspaper Le Moniteur universel. Its weekly issues were written in French and edited by Alexandre Blacque at the expense of the Porte. A few months later, a firman of the sultan ordered that a Turkish gazette be published under the named \"Takvim-i Vekayi\" (Calendar of Affairs), which would be effectively translating the Moniteur ottoman, and issued irregularly until November 4, 1922. Laws and decrees of the sultan were published in it, as well as descriptions of court festivities. The first non-official Turkish newspaper, Ceride-i Havadis (Register of Events), was published by an Englishman, William Churchill, in 1840. The first private newspaper to be published by Turkish journalists, Terc\u00fcman-\u0131 Ahv\u00e2l (Interpreter of Events), was founded by \u0130brahim \u015einasi and Agah Efendi and issued in October 1860; the owners stated that \"freedom of expression is a part of human nature\", thereby initiating an era of free press as inspired by the ideals of 18th century French Enlightenment.\u00c1goston & Masters, p. 433. In the meantime, the first private newspaper written solely in Arabic, Mir'at al-ahwal, had been founded by a Syrian poet, Rizqallah Hassun, in 1855, but it had been suspended a year later by Ottoman authorities because of its critical tone regarding their policies. Subsequently, several newspapers flourished in the provinces. A new press code inspired by French law, Matbuat Nizamnamesi, was issued in 1864, accompanied by the establishment of a censorship office. When Sultan Abdulhamid II revoked the constitution, Ottomans established newspapers based in foreign countries as they felt they could no longer operate freely in the empire.Kendall, p. 338. Elisabeth Kendall, author of \"Between Politics and Literature: Journals in Alexandria and Istanbul at the End of the Nineteenth Century,\" wrote that therefore by the 1880s \"purer cultural journalism\" became the focus of publications that remained in the imperial capital.Kendall, p. 340. ==By city== The Ottoman capital, Constantinople (now Istanbul), was the centre of the press activity.Kendall, p. 339. In 1876 there were forty-seven journals published in Constantinople. Most were in minority and foreign languages, and thirteen of them were in Ottoman Turkish.Kendall, p. 331. Many newspapers in non-Muslim minority and foreign languages were produced in Galata, with production in daylight hours and distribution at nighttime; Ottoman authorities did not allow production of the Galata-based newspapers at night. \\- Volume 12 of Bamberger Orientstudien - Old // Cited: p. 40 Kendall wrote that Constantinople by the 1870s lacked specialised literary journals found in Alexandria, Egypt. What journals that were in Constantinople had a general focus,Kendall, p. 337. and Kendall stated that the potential audience base being \"extremely limited\" frustrated the development of these journals. An 1875 stamp duty caused, in Kendall's eyes, \"more marginal\" ones to vanish. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire Constantinople, now Istanbul, remained the centre of Turkish journalism. ==Turkish== Vekayi-i giridiyye, a newspaper published in Egypt after 1830, was the first newspaper in the Turkish language in the empire. It also had a bilingual Turkish-Greek version.Strauss, \"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire,\" p. 22 (PDF p. 24) Johann Strauss, author of \"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire: Translations of the Kanun-\u0131 Esasi and Other Official Texts into Minority Languages,\" wrote that the press in Ottoman Turkish began to \"rise\" after 1860, after press in Christian languages had already developed.Strauss, \"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire,\" p. 25 (PDF p. 27) Ottoman Turkish publications included: * BasiretStrauss, Johann. \"Twenty Years in the Ottoman capital: the memoirs of Dr. Hristo Tanev Stambolski of Kazanlik (1843-1932) from an Ottoman point of view.\" In: Herzog, Christoph and Richard Wittmann (editors).

Other publications in Karamanli were Anatol Ahteri (\u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03bb \u0391\u03c7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03af), Angeliaforos, Angeliaforos co\u00e7uklar i\u00e7un, \u015eafak (\u03a3\u03b1\u03c6\u03ac\u03ba), and Terakki (\u03a4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03ba\u03ae). The second and third were created by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Demetrius Nicolaides also applied to make his own Karamanli publication, Asya (\"Asia\"), but was denied. Evangelina Baltia and Ay\u0219e Kavak, authors of \"Publisher of the newspaper Konstantinoupolis for half a century,\" wrote that they could find no information explaining why Nicolaides' proposal was turned down. // Cited: p. 42 ==Arabic== The first Arabic-language newspaper in Egypt was al-Tanbih, published by the French, and headquartered in Alexandria, around the start of the 1800s. The first official Egyptian newspaper, in Arabic and based in Cairo, was Jurn\u0101l al-Khid\u012bw and appeared over ten years after al-Tanbih. The Arabic newspaper Al-Jaw\u0101\u02beib began in Constantinople, established by F\u0101ris al- Shidy\u0101q a.k.a. Ahmed Faris Efendi (1804-1887), after 1860. It published Ottoman laws in Arabic, including the Ottoman Constitution of 1876.Strauss, \"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire,\" p. 34 (PDF p. 36) Several provincial newspapers (vilayet gazeteleri in Turkish) were in Arabic. The first such newspaper was \u1e24ad\u012bqat al-Akhb\u0101r, described by Johann Strauss, author of \"Language and power in the late Ottoman Empire,\" as \"semi-official\".Strauss, Johann. \"Language and power in the late Ottoman Empire\" (Chapter 7). In: Murphey, Rhoads (editor). Imperial Lineages and Legacies in the Eastern Mediterranean: Recording the Imprint of Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman Rule. Routledge, 7 July 2016. (, 9781317118442), Google Books PT192. Published by Khal\u012bl al-Kh\u016br\u012b (1836 \u2013 1907), it began in 1858.Strauss, \"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire,\" p. 26 (PDF p. 28) Others include the Tunis-based Al- R\u0101\u02beid at-T\u016bnis\u012b and a bilingual Ottoman Turkish-Arabic paper in Iraq, Zevra / al-Zawr\u0101\u02be; the former was established in 1860 and the latter in 1869. Strauss said the latter had \"the highest prestige, at least for a while\" of the provincial Arabic newspapers.Strauss, \"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire,\" p. 25-26 (PDF p. 27-28) Strauss, also author of \"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire: Translations of the Kanun-\u0131 Esasi and Other Official Texts into Minority Languages,\" stated that \"some writers\" stated that versions of the Takvim-i Vekayi in Arabic existed. ==Armenian== * Jamanak * Takvim-i Vekayi Armenian version ==Bulgarian== Bulgarian newspapers in the late Ottoman period published in Constantinople were Makedoniya, Napred\u016dk or Napred\u01cek (\"Progress\"), Pravo, and Turtsiya; Strauss described the last one as \"probably a Bulgarian version of [the French-language paper] La Turquie.\"Strauss, \"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire,\" p. 36. Other Bulgarian newspapers included the official newspaper of Danube Vilayet, Dunav/Tuna; Izto\u010dno Vreme; and one published by Protestant Christian missionaries from the United States, Zornitsa (\"Morning Star\"). Strauss wrote that Izto\u010dno Vreme was \"a sort of Bulgarian edition of the Levant Times\". (info page on book at Martin Luther University) - Cited: p. 34 (PDF p. 36) ==Greek== There was a bilingual Turkish-Greek version of Vekayi-i giridiyye (\u039a\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03c6\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03c2 in Greek). There was a Greek-language newspaper established in 1861, Anatolikos Ast\u0113r (\"Eastern Star\"). Konstantinos Photiadis was the editor in chief,Strauss, \"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire,\" p. 32 (PDF p. 34) and Demetrius Nicolaides served as an editor. In 1867 Nicolaides established his own Greek-language newspaper, K\u014dnstantinoupolis. Johann Strauss, author of \"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire: Translations of the Kanun-\u0131 Esasi and Other Official Texts into Minority Languages,\" wrote that the publication \"was long to remain the most widely read Greek paper in the Ottoman Empire.\" During periods when K\u014dnstantinoupolis was not in operation Nicolaides edited Thrak\u0113 (\"Thrace\"; August 1870 \u2013 1880) and Avgi (\"Aurora\"; 6 July 1880 \u2013 10 July 1884). \\- Volume 12 of Bamberger Orientstudien - Old // Cited: p. 37 Also: * Chrysalis \\- Volume 12 of Bamberger Orientstudien - Old // Cited: p. 34 * Pandora * Takvim-i Vekayi Greek version ==Judaeo-Spanish (Ladino)== A 1902 Issue of La Epoca, a Ladino newspaper from Salonica (Thessaloniki) In 1860 Jurnal Yisraelit was established by Yehezkel Gabay (1825-1896). Johann Strauss stated that he was perceived as a founder of the practice of journalism within the Turkish Jewish community.Strauss, \"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire,\" p. 24 (PDF p. 26) ==Persian== Akhtar (\"The Star\"), a newspaper in Persian There was a Persian-language paper, Akhtar (\"The Star\"), which was established in 1876 and published Persian versions of Ottoman government documents, including the 1876 Constitution. Strauss stated that \"some writers\" stated that versions of the Takvim-i Vekayi in Persian existed. ==Western languages== ===French=== The French had also established a newspaper in Constantinople in 1795, but it closed as French journalists moved their base to Alexandria, Egypt after the French campaign in Egypt and Syria. The cities of Constantinople (Istanbul), Beirut, Salonika (Thessaloniki), and Smyrna (\u0130zmir) had domestically-published French-language newspapers.Strauss, Johann. \"Language and power in the late Ottoman Empire\" (Chapter 7). In: Murphey, Rhoads (editor). Imperial Lineages and Legacies in the Eastern Mediterranean: Recording the Imprint of Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman Rule. Routledge, 7 July 2016. (, 9781317118459), p. 122. The publications were also active in the eastern Mediterranean Sea area. Non- Muslim ethnic minorities in the empire used French as a lingua franca and therefore used these publications. In addition French businesspeople and vocational workers used French-language media to get in touch with clients in the empire. French-language journalism was initially centred in Smyrna but by the 1860s it began shifting towards Constantinople. In addition, newspapers written in other western European languages had editions in French or editions with portions in French. In the history of the empire over 400 titles of periodicals were partially or entirely in the French language, with about 66% fully in French and the rest with other languages; the total includes about 131 titles from Ottoman Egypt. Takvim-i Vekayi had versions in French. Non- Muslim ethnic minorities in the empire used French as a lingua franca and therefore used these publications. In addition French businesspeople and vocational workers used French-language media to get in touch with clients in the empire. Lorans Tanatar Baruh of SALT and Sara Yontan Musnik of the National Library of France stated that the post-1918 Ottoman government favored the French-language media. The use of French continued by the time the empire ended in 1923, and remained for about a decade more in the Republic of Turkey.
