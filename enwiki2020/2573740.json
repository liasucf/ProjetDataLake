The council was first incorporated as the \"Municipal District of Smithfield and Fairfield\" on 8 December 1888, and the council's name was changed to the \"Municipality of Fairfield\" in 1920, before being proclaimed a city in 1979. The City of Fairfield comprises an area of and as of the had a population of . The Mayor of the City of Fairfield is Cr. Frank Carbone, the first popularly-elected independent mayor of Fairfield. Fairfield is considered one of the most ethnically diverse suburbs in Australia. At the 2016 census, the proportion of residents in the Fairfield local government area who stated their ancestry as Vietnamese and Assyrian, was in excess of sixteen times the national average. The area was linguistically diverse, with Vietnamese, Arabic, Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, or Cantonese languages spoken in households, and ranged from two times to seventeen times the national averages. The Smithfield-Wetherill Park Industrial Estate is the largest industrial estate in the Southern Hemisphere and is the centre of manufacturing and distribution in GWS, with more than 1,000 manufacturing, wholesale, transport and service firms.Smithfield- Wetherill Park ==Geography== A few small areas of the original bushland remain, including examples of Cumberland Plain Woodland, which is listed under the Threatened Species Conservation Act. There are 580 parks (60 of which are major parks), including, one of the largest urban parks in the world, Western Sydney Parklands. Fairfield City is mainly residential in nature with large- scale industrial estates at Wetherill Park and Smithfield. Fairfield Showground is an important cultural venue. Prominent roads such as Cumberland Highway and The Horsley Drive wind through it. ==Suburbs in the local government area== Suburbs in the City of Fairfield are: ==History== Cabramatta Civic Hall, completed in 1944 to a design by J. A. Dobson, was the Cabramatta and Canley Vale seat from 1944\u20131948 and the Fairfield Council seat from 1949.Master Builders' Federation of Australia. and Illuminating Engineering Society of Australia (N.S.W.). Building and engineering 1942 http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-319042287 For more than 30,000 years, Aboriginal people from the Cabrogal\u2013Gandangara tribe have lived in the area. One of Sydney's oldest trees, the Bland Oak, was planted in the 1830s in Carramar. European settlement began early in the 19th century and was supported by railway construction in 1856. At the turn of the century the area had a population of 2,500 people and with fertile soils, produced crops for distribution in Sydney. The council was first incorporated as the \"Municipal District of Smithfield and Fairfield\" on 8 December 1888, becoming the \"Municipality of Smithfield and Fairfield\" from 1906. On 26 October 1920, the council's name was changed to the \"Municipality of Fairfield\", in recognition of the changing centre of business in the council area. Rapid population increase after World War II saw the settlement of many ex-service men and European migrants. Large scale Housing Commission development in the 1950s swelled the population to 38,000. From 1 January 1949, under the Local Government (Areas) Act 1948, the Municipality of Cabramatta and Canley Vale was amalgamated into the Municipality of Fairfield. In the , the population had reached 114,000 and was becoming one of the larger local government areas in New South Wales. On 18 May 1979, the Municipality of Fairfield was granted city status, becoming the \"City of Fairfield\". On 26 November 2001, the former Deputy Mayor of Fairfield and councillor from 1987 to 1999, Phuong Ngo, was convicted to life imprisonment for the 1994 murder of the local state MP for Cabramatta (and former Deputy Mayor), John Newman, a crime which has been described as Australia's first political assassination. Controversy has arisen in the years since then of the presence Ngo's name on various council plaques from his time on council. In September 2006, Fairfield Council announced the introduction of a trail ban on spitting in public on public health grounds. However, it was reported that advice provided to council from NSW Health was that spitting does not impact on the transmission of infectious diseases. The law proved difficult to prosecute. == Heritage listings == The City of Fairfield has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Bonnyrigg, Cartwright Street: Bonnyrigg House * Bonnyrigg, Lot 1 Cartwright Street: Male Orphan School land * Fairfield, Great Southern railway: Fairfield railway station, Sydney * Horsley Park, 52\u201358 Jamieson Close: Horsley complex * Lansvale, Hume Highway: Lansdowne Bridge ==Demographics== At the there were people in the Fairfield local government area, of these 49.3 per cent were male and 50.7 per cent were female.
