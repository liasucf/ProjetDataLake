    "text": "The Have a Nice Day Tour was a worldwide concert tour by American rock band Bon Jovi. It took place between November 2005 and July 2006. The tour supported their ninth studio album Have a Nice Day. The tour was a significant commercial success, as the group played to ~2,000,000 fans, and the tour grossed a total $132 million.http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/949447/bon-jovi-billboards-top- touring-act-of-the-year The tour was the third-highest-grossing tour of 2006, just behind The Rolling Stones' A Bigger Bang World Tour and Madonna's Confessions Tour. ==The show== Dublin May 2006 The set lists greatly varied between concerts, so after each show its set list was posted on the official website. Most concerts began with the song \"Last Man Standing\" from the Have a Nice Day record, with the show beginning as Jon Bon Jovi suddenly appeared on a small platform in the middle of the audience at the far end from the stage, followed by \"You Give Love a Bad Name\". \"Livin' on a Prayer\" was almost always played as the final\u00e9 before any encores. At some shows, Jennifer Nettles performed with the band in the song \"Who Says You Can't Go Home\". On one show in the National Bowl at Milton Keynes, 1500 fans sat in the bar watching England play and win their first-round match in the 2006 FIFA World Cup; Jon Bon Jovi performed the encore in a red England 'away' top. At the concert in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, the band played their longest song, \"Dry County\", for the first time in over ten years.https://bjtours.jimdo.com/let-s-go-on- tour/2005-2006-have-a-nice-day/63-2006-05-13-ltu-arena-d\u00fcsseldorf-germany/ The final concert of the tour at New Jersey's Giants Stadium was the only concert at which the band played the Have a Nice Day song \"I Am\", so that they would fulfill their commitment of playing every song from the album on the tour.https://bjtours.jimdo.com/let-s-go-on-tour/2005-2006-have-a-nice- day/88-2006-07-29-giants-stadium-east-rutherford-new-jersey-usa/ At several of the band's summer stadium shows, the band was known to play extremely long setlists, some of them running nearly three hours, totaling approximately 25 songs, including encores that sometimes had as much as seven songs. ==Opening acts== For the first North American leg of the tour as well as the United Kingdom dates of the European leg, each city had a local band open for Bon Jovi; the band had decided this for a chance to promote local talent. Canadian band Nickelback, who had great success with their latest release (All The Right Reasons) supported Bon Jovi on the European leg of the tour, as well as on the band's summer stadium tour in North America. ==Personnel== ===Bon Jovi=== *Jon Bon Jovi \u2013 lead vocals, guitar, maracas for Keep the Faith *Richie Sambora \u2013 lead guitar, slide guitar, lead vocals for I'll Be There For You, backing vocals, talk box *Hugh McDonald - bass, backing vocals *David Bryan \u2013 keyboards, backing vocals *Tico Torres \u2013 drums, percussion ===Additional musicians=== *Bobby Bandiera - rhythm guitar, backing vocals *Jeff Kazee - keyboards, Hammond organ, backing vocals ==Set list== As in most Bon Jovi tours, Bon Jovi changed their set-list every night, but they have similarities. Especially during the first North American leg of the tour the various set-list only had minor differences. While most songs played were from the album \"Have a Nice Day\", the title track and Who Says You Can't Go Home were even played at every concert, older hits like Livin' on a Prayer, You Give Love a Bad Name, It's My Life, Bad Medicine and Wanted Dead or Alive were also present at every single gig. Here the average set-list: # \"Last Man Standing\" # \"You Give Love a Bad Name\" # \"Complicated\" # \"Born to Be My Baby\" # \"Story of My Life\" # \"I'll Sleep When I'm Dead\" # \"Runaway\" # \"The Radio Saved My Life Tonight\" # \"Novocaine\" # \"I Won't Back Down\" (Tom Petty cover) # \"Have a Nice Day\" # \"Who Says You Can't Go Home?\" # \"It's My Life\" # \"I'll Be There for You\" # \"Blaze of Glory\" (cover) # \"Bed of Roses # \"Bad Medicine\" # \"Raise Your Hands\" # \"Livin' on a Prayer\" Encore: # * \"Welcome to Wherever You Are\" # * \"In These Arms\" # * \"Everyday\" # * \"Wanted Dead or Alive # * \"Someday I'll Be Saturday Night\" ==Tour dates== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of concerts, showing date, city, country, venue, tickets sold, amount of
