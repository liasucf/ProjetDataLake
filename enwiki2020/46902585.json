    "text": "Milo\u0161 Vojinovi\u0107 (; 1332) was a Serbian nobleman who served Emperor Stefan Du\u0161an (r. 1331\u201355) as stavilac, the son of general Vojin and brother of Vojislav and Altoman. He is a hero of the pre-Kosovo cycle in Serbian epic poetry. Milo\u0161 was the eldest son of Vojin, a vojvoda (general) that served King Stefan De\u010danski and King Stefan Du\u0161an and held the title of knez of Hum. Vojin was one of the more powerful nobles of King Stefan De\u010danski, while his sons were in Young King Du\u0161an's circle. When a conflict occurred between the King and his son, Du\u0161an, however, Vojin and other noblemen joined the Young King Du\u0161an (1330\u201331). Vojin's support of Du\u0161an further elevated the Vojinovi\u0107 family. Metropolitan Arsenije of Prizren, kaznac Baldovin, vojvoda Gradislav, \u017eupan Vratko, knez Grgur Kurjakovi\u0107, stavilac Milo\u0161 (title mentioned for the first time), vojvoda Dejan Manjak, Gradislav Su\u0161enica, Nikola Bu\u0107a, and archdeacon Marin Barani\u0107, all signed the document issued by Stefan Uro\u0161 III, dated 22 January 1325, for the sale of some maritime possessions to the Republic of Ragusa.Srpska akademija nauka i umetnosti 1908, p. 252Istorijski institut u Beogradu, SANU 1976, p. 21 The possessions, Ston and Pelje\u0161ac, were officially handed over in 1333, with Milo\u0161 also being present. After the death of Milo\u0161's father Vojin, his sons divided their father's province. Soon after Vojin's death, Milo\u0161 died without progeny, his possessions being divided among his brothers Vojislav and Altoman. __NOTOC__ ==Legacy== ===Serbian epic poetry=== In Serbian epic poetry Milo\u0161 is celebrated as a central hero, most notably in the famous Wedding of Emperor Du\u0161an. He is depicted as the youngest of the three Vojinovi\u0107 brothers, as a carefree and cheerful soul rejecting his noble background to be a shepherd in the \u0160ar Mountains. Though carefree and simple-minded, Milo\u0161 is depicted as one of the strongest warriors in Du\u0161an's empire and as being very strategic and adept in battle. It is believed that there once existed an entire epic cycle dedicated to Milo\u0161, however the poems did not survive to when Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107 began documenting Serbian epics in 1814. Milo\u0161 is the central character in the following epic poems: * Wedding of Emperor Du\u0161an (\u0416\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0434\u0431\u0430 \u0414\u0443\u0448\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430) (recorded by Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107 1814) * Milo\u0161 Vojinovi\u0107 and the Fiery Lions (\u041c\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0448 \u0412\u043e\u0458\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b \u0438 \u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u043e\u0433\u045a\u0435\u043d\u0438) (recorded by Bogoljub Petranovi\u0107 1870) * Milo\u0161 Vojinovi\u0107 and the Duke of Kotor (\u041e\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0430) (recorded by Sima Milutinovi\u0107 1837) ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:14th-century Serbian nobility Category:People of the Serbian Empire Category:Characters in Serbian epic poetry Milos Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown ",
