While still a student, he started working in journalism in 1970 as a freelancer for the newspaper Presse-Oc\u00e9an. His work for this newspaper started on the occasion of a trip to Norway where he proposed a story about the football club Str\u00f8msgodset IF, champions of Norway in 1970, that the FCN (FC Nantes) was scheduled to meet later in the European Cup. Later, in the afternoon of 28 January 1972, during his journalism work, he found himself at the Saint-Pierre square when a fire started in the Nantes Cathedral; he was the first journalist at the scene, following the fire-fighters right to the fire in the attic of the building, and his report was an essential part of the paper the next day, the first page only contained a picture of the fire and the words \"16 hours 19 \".Jean-Charles Cozic et Daniel Garnier, La Presse \u00e0 Nantes de 1757 \u00e0 nos jours === Television === In 1973 he joined the ORTF Ile- de-France. He started work at TV station Antenne 2 in 1975 and took control of the news show at 18:45 the following year, from 1976 up to 1979.

He started editing again in July 1981, as editor of the society department, and he also started presenting Journal de 20 heures in summer 1982. In February 1984 he left Antenne 2 for TF1 where he presented their Journal de 20 heures. His work there then stalled against the tandem of rival TV presenter team Christine Ockrent / Bernard Rapp. Uncomfortable with the editing of TF1 and opposed to the style of the news show they put on the air in January 1985, which was dramatized and sensationalized, he remained nostalgic for channel A2 and eventually returned to his earlier employ in January 1986 to present the 20 hours alternating with Bernard Rapp He was dropped from the 20 heures news show in July 1987 for having \"abused\" the chief of police of Paris in the Malik Oussekine case.

He also copresented for ten years Telethon and Nuits des \u00e9toiles alongside Hubert Reeves. During one telethon broadcast, while interviewing Michel Boujenah who was telling incredible stories, Claude S\u00e9rillon became known for a very crazy laugh. === France 2 === 17 August 1998, he took the reins of 20 heures on France 2, where he then proposed a revamped news journal show, but the ratings were nevertheless lower than those of channel 1. On 13 September 1999, true to his reputation for independence, he made an interview without concession of Lionel Jospin then Prime minister,Interview de Lionel Jospin par Claude S\u00e9rillon au JT de France 2 date=13 September 1999 sur le site de l'Ina which was severely criticized.. With the Presidential campaign approaching, S\u00e9rillon, as in 1987, became an interviewer \"boud\u00e9 \u00e0 gauche et peu appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 \u00e0 droite\" (snubbed by the Left and little appreciated by the Right). On 12 July 2001 he stopped doing the news show, and, Olivier Mazerolle, the new boss of news at the channel, retired Claude from the show.. In September, he was replaced by David Pujadas, who had just left LCI. Thereafter, he left France 2 and then found his full freedom of speech.
