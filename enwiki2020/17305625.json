    "text": "The Politics of Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol, Italy takes place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democracy, whereby the President of Regional Government is the head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the Regional Government and Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Regional Council. However, since a constitutional reform in 1972, almost all the executive and legislative powers are devolved to the two provinces of which the region is composed: Trentino and the South Tyrol. The politics of Trentino takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democracy, whereby the governor is heads of government, while the politics of South Tyrol retains a parliamentary system, in which the governor is usually the most voted provincial deputy and heads the provincial government. ==Executive branch== The Regional Government (Giunta Regionale, Landesregierung) is presided by the President of the Region (Presidente della Regione, Landeshauptmann) and is composed by the President and the Ministers (Assessori), who are currently 5, including two Vice Presidents. Since 2001, the Presidents of the two Provinces alternate as President of the Region, with the one who's not in charge serving as First Vice President. ===Current composition=== *President: Ugo Rossi (PATT\u2013Trentino) *First Vice President: Arno Kompatscher (SVP\u2013South Tyrol) *Vice President: Roberto Bizzo (PD\u2013South Tyrol) *Minister: Luigi Chiocchetti (UAL\u2013Trentino) *Minister: Martha Stocker (SVP\u2013South Tyrol) ===List of Presidents=== ===Provincial executives=== ====Trentino==== ====South Tyrol==== ==Legislative branch== The Regional Council of Trentino-Alto Adige (Consiglio Regionale del Trentino-Alto Adige) is composed of 70 members, 35 from Trentino and 35 from South Tyrol. The regional deputies are elected separately as provincial deputies. In practice the Regional Council is the meeting of the two Provincial Councils. ==Local government== ===Municipalities in Trentino=== {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:150px\" | Municipality ! colspan=1 | Inhabitants ! colspan=2 style=\"width:150px\" | Mayor ! colspan=1 style=\"width:180px\" | Party ! colspan=1 | Election |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Trento |117,317 |Alessandro Andreatta |Democratic Party |2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Rovereto |39,289 |Francesco Valduga |Independent |2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text- align: left;\" | Pergine Valsugana |21,280 |Roberto Oss Emer |Independent |2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Arco |17,526 |Alessandro Betta |Democratic Party |2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Riva del Garda |16,926 |Adalberto Mosaner |Democratic Party |2015 |} ===Municipalities in South Tyrol=== {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:150px\" | Municipality ! colspan=1 | Inhabitants ! colspan=2 style=\"width:150px\" | Mayor ! colspan=1 style=\"width:180px\" | Party ! colspan=1 | Election |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Bolzano |106,441 |Renzo Caramaschi |Democratic Party |2016 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Merano |39,462 |Paul R\u00f6sch |Greens |2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Brixen |21,535 |Peter Brunner |South Tyrolean People's Party |2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Laives |17,700 |Christian Bianchi |Lega Nord Alto Adige \u2013 S\u00fcdtirol |2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Bruneck |16,109 |Roland Griessmair |South Tyrolean People's Party |2014 |} ==Political parties and elections== The Region has actually two different system of parties: one for each Province. Since the constitutional reform of 2001, regional elections are nothing more than two separate provincial elections and the Region does not provide anymore vote totals region-wide. ===Latest provincial elections=== ====Trentino==== ====South Tyrol==== ===Latest general election in Trentino- Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol=== ==Sources== *Trentino Alto-Adige Region \u2013 Elections *Provincial Council of Trento \u2013 Legislatures *Provincial Council of Bolzano \u2013 Legislatures *Provincial Government of Trento \u2013 Elections *Provincial Government of Bolzano \u2013 Elections *Cattaneo Institute \u2013 Archive of Election Data *Parties and Elections in Europe \u2013 Province of Trento *Parties and Elections in Europe \u2013 Province of Bolzano *Ministry of the Interior \u2013 Historical Archive of Elections *\"Political parties in Alto Adige from 1945 to 2005\", an essay by Gunther Pallaver ==External links== *Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol Region *Constitution of Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol *Provincial Government of Trento *Provincial Council of Trento *Provincial Government of Bolzano *Provincial Council of Bolzano Category:Government of Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol ",
