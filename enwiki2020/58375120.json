    "text": "Pom-Bear is a brand of teddy bear shaped snack food made out of potatoes. They are produced by Intersnack and are sold in over 30 European countries. They were first introduced in 1987 in Germany where they are known as Pom-B\u00e4r and were later introduced to the UK in 1990. Pom-Bear come in three main flavours (original, cheese and onion, and salt and vinegar) as well as other regional varieties. Over the years the brand has also been sold in a variety of limited edition flavours and shapes, including pizza and snowmen. In 2008 the British consumer rights organisation Which? criticised the smiling bear mascot featured on Pom-Bear packaging for promoting unhealthy snacks to children. The manufacturer responded to growing concerns over unhealthy snacks by reducing the level of unsaturated fat in the product. In 2010 a specially produced advertisement featuring a 3D Pom-Bear was shown before screenings of Shrek Forever After and Toy Story 3. ==See also== * List of brand name snack foods * List of fictional bears ==References== Category:Brand name snack foods Category:Brand name potato chips and crisps ",
