    "text": "The Nissan S20 engine was a straight-6, DOHC internal combustion engine produced by Nissan (designed by the former Prince engineers) from 1969 to 1973. It was essentially a revised production variant of the 1966 Prince GR8 engine from Prince/Nissan's R380 racecar. It produces at 7000 rpm and of torque at 5600 rpm. The S20 weighs . This engine is not to be confused with the unrelated Nissan SR20, which is a straight 4 cylinder petrol engine used in other Nissan models. The S20 powered Nissan's Skyline GT-R (C10 and C110) and Fairlady Z432 models. == In Motorsport == Compared to the Nissan L series straight six engines, the S20 was too small and too complex. In the 1970 All- Japan Fuji 1000km race, 6 Fairlady Z 432R models were entered with the S20, and one with an L24 fitted. The Z fitted with the L24 won easily, and due to its simpler and more robust design, the L- series went on to become the favored engine in motorsport and tuning,https://www.classiczcars.com/forums/topic/56870-l24-battles- six-s20s-guess-who-wins/ while the S20 remains relatively obscure. ==History== S20 engine installed in Fairlady Z432 The S20 was one of the technical carryovers to the Nissan brand from Prince technology. The Skyline model - built as a Prince car since the model's inception in the 1950s - received the new engine. The Skyline GT-B in 1969 saw the introduction of the PGC10 GT-R, followed by the KPGC10 GT-R with a shorter wheelbase and 2 fewer doors in 1970. This model would later win 49 straight touring car victories. For 1972, Nissan introduced the C110 Skyline powered by the L series of engines. A small number of KPGC110 GT-R would be built utilizing the remainder of the S20s. The S20 was later fitted to the Nissan Fairlady Z432, a sports racing model of the Nissan Fairlady Z (S30) model line. The S20 features a dual overhead cam, cross-flow head with four valves per cylinder, and pent-roof combustion chamber. Most engines utilized triple Mikuni-Solex 40PHH dual-choke carburetors; models after 1969 offered optional Lucas mechanical fuel injection. In racing trim, the fuel-injected motors reportedly produced over , with for larger tracks like Fuji Speedway. This engine was used in the following vehicles: * Skyline GT-R (PGC10 type) 4-door sedan 1969 - 1970. (832 units) * Skyline GT-R (KPGC10 type) 2-door coupe 1970 - 1972. shorter wheelbase than the PGC10. (1,197 units) * Skyline GT-R (KPGC110 type) January\u2013April 1973. (197 units) * Fairlady Z432 (PS30) 1969 - 1972 * Fairlady Z432R (PS30SB) Z432 race car based nearly lighter than production Z432.
