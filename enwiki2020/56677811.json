So 'radical' were the ideas of Taliaferro that the convention refused to print his protest in the pages of [its journal].\"John D.

At the secession convention he said: \"Sir, I am behind no man in attachment to Louisiana. I am unable to see that higher and grander position which gentlemen say Louisiana is to assume by the act of secession. Clouds and darkness rather, are before me. The dimness of age, perhaps, prevents me from penetrating the gloom and seeing the bright skies and green fields beyond. In the exercise of my best judgment, and under my honest convictions of the ruinous tendency of this measure, I must pronounce it an act of madness and of folly. Sir, I vote Nay.\" Taliaferro had many children, several died young. ==References== Category:1798 births Category:1876 deaths Category:Reconstruction Era Category:Justices of the Louisiana Supreme Court ",
