    "text": "SV G\u00f6ppingen is a German association football club from the city of G\u00f6ppingen, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The team was established on 13 October 1905 as 1. G\u00f6ppingener Fu\u03b2ballverein and lays claim to being the oldest football club in the city. On 24 April 1920, soon after World War I the club merged with Athletiksportverein 1895 G\u00f6ppingen and took on its current identity. The origins of predecessor side ASV go back to 11 August 1895 formation of 1. Athletik Klub G\u00f6ppingen. This club merged with Kraftsportverein Fortuna G\u00f6ppingen in 1901 to become Athleten-Klub Foruna G\u00f6ppingen. They adopted the name Athletiksportverein G\u00f6ppingen early in 1907, and in 1911 merged with Sportclub G\u00f6ppingen.Gr\u00fcne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag __TOC__ ==History== SV first came to notice in 1934 when they became part of the Gauliga W\u00fcrttemberg, one of 16 top-flight divisions created in the reorganization of German football under the Third Reich a year earlier. The club only spent the 1934\u201335 and 1936\u201337 seasons in first division play, being sent down on both occasions after 10th-place finishes. They returned to the Gauliga in 1943, captured the division title, and then went out in the opening round of the national playoffs to KSG Saarbr\u00fccken (3:5). The following season was that last before World War II interrupted play across the country. After the war, G\u00f6ppingen took up play in the Landesliga W\u00fcrttemberg (II), but was sent down in 1948 after just three seasons. It was not until 1968 that they returned to third tier competition in the Amateurliga Nordw\u00fcrttemberg. They finished second and the next year took the division title, which led to their participation in the national amateur championship playoffs. SV moved on to the semifinals where they were eliminated 1:0, 2:1 by SC J\u00fclich 1910. In league play, a successful promotion playoff advanced SV to the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (II) where they found themselves overmatched. They returned to the Amateurliga Nordw\u00fcrttemberg (III) which later (1980) became the Amateuroberliga Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (III). They enjoyed a string of strong finishes through the late 70s before slipping away to lower tier local play in the mid-80s. It was during this period that they made appearances in the opening rounds of the German Cup tournament (1975, 1980, 1984). SV played first in the Oberliga Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (III) until 1985, then in the Verbandsliga W\u00fcrttemberg (IV) until 1991 and then descended through the Landesliga W\u00fcrttemberg (V) to the Bezirksliga (VI) in 1994. Since 2007, SV have played in the Landesliga W\u00fcrttemberg (VI), from where they earned promotion back to the Verbandsliga in 2009. In 2013\u201314 and 2014\u201315 the club finished runners-up in the league and thereby earned the right to compete in the promotion round to the Oberliga. In 2014 it missed out to FC Germania Friedrichstal and, in 2015, to 1. CfR Pforzheim, thereby remaining in the Verbandsliga. Finishing runners-up in the league for a third consecutive time in 2015\u201316 the club took part in the promotion round once more, this time defeating TSG Weinheim on aggregate and moving up to the Oberliga, ending a 31-year absence for the club. ==Honours== * Gauliga W\u00fcrttemberg (I) ** Champions: 1944 * Amateurliga Nordw\u00fcrttemberg (III) ** Champions: 1970 * Verbandsliga W\u00fcrttemberg ** Runners-up: 2014, 2015, 2016 ==Recent seasons== The recent season-by-season performance of the club: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#dfdfdf\" | Season | Division | Tier | Position |- align=\"center\" | 2003\u201304 | align=\"left\"| Bezirksliga Neckar/Fils | rowspan=4|VII | 11th |- align=\"center\" | 2004\u201305 | align=\"left\"| Bezirksliga Neckar/Fils | 6th |- align=\"center\" | 2005\u201306 | align=\"left\"| Bezirksliga Neckar/Fils | 3rd |- align=\"center\" | 2006\u201307 | align=\"left\"| Bezirksliga Neckar/Fils | style=\"background:#ddffdd\"| 1st \u2191 |- align=\"center\" | 2007\u201308 | align=\"left\"| Landesliga W\u00fcrttemberg II | VI | 5th |- align=\"center\" | 2008\u201309 | align=\"left\"| Landesliga W\u00fcrttemberg II | VII | style=\"background:#ddffdd\"| 2nd \u2191 |- align=\"center\" | 2009\u201310 | align=\"left\"| Verbandsliga W\u00fcrttemberg | rowspan=7| VI | 8th |- align=\"center\" | 2010\u201311 | align=\"left\"| Verbandsliga W\u00fcrttemberg | 4th |- align=\"center\" | 2011\u201312 | align=\"left\"| Verbandsliga W\u00fcrttemberg | 3rd |- align=\"center\" | 2012\u201313 | align=\"left\"| Verbandsliga W\u00fcrttemberg | 3rd |- align=\"center\" | 2013\u201314 | align=\"left\"| Verbandsliga W\u00fcrttemberg | 2nd |- align=\"center\" | 2014\u201315 | align=\"left\"| Verbandsliga W\u00fcrttemberg | 2nd |- align=\"center\" | 2015\u201316 | align=\"left\"| Verbandsliga W\u00fcrttemberg | style=\"background:#ddffdd\"| 2nd \u2191 |- align=\"center\" | 2016\u201317 | align=\"left\"| Oberliga Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg | V | |} * With the introduction of the Regionalligas in 1994 and the 3.
