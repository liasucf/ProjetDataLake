It has a capacity of 40,192 seats and is the centerpiece of Vietnam's National Sports Complex. It was officially opened in September 2003 and was the main venue for the Southeast Asian Games later that year, hosting the opening and closing ceremony as well as the men's football and athletics events. The stadium is home to the Vietnam national football team, and hosts its home international friendly matches. It is also home to Th\u1ec3 C\u00f4ng. Located 10 kilometres north-west of central Hanoi, the 40,000-seat stadium is the second biggest in the country in terms of capacity and was built at a cost of US$53 million. Arched roofs cover the grandstands on the east and west sides of the arena, providing shelter for half of the seats. The area provides training facilities for the teams with two football training grounds located next to the stadium. ==History== Ideas for a new national stadium in Vietnam were marked up in 1998 as the government conducted a prefeasibility study for a national sports complex. In July 2000, Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan V\u0103n Kh\u1ea3i approved a project of a stadium at the heart of Vietnam's National Sports Complex in preparation for hosting the 2003 Southeast Asian Games. Four firms, namely Hanoi International Group (HISG - China), Philipp Holzmann (Germany), Bouygues (France) and Lemna-Keystone (United States), participated in the bidding of the stadium's construction. The process was controversial due to violations of technical and financial requirements in HISG and Holzmann's bids, corruption allegations involving a French donation as well as the intransparency in the panel's decision making. In the end, HISG won the bid and signed a commitment contract on August 14, 2001. Construction on the stadium started in 2002. During the developmental phase, the stadium was referred to as S\u00e2n v\u1eadn \u0111\u1ed9ng Trung t\u00e2m (\"central stadium\"). The stadium was architecturally complete in June 2003. In August 2003, the stadium was officially named M\u1ef9 \u0110\u00ecnh National Stadium, taking after the name of the commune area the stadium is located within.
