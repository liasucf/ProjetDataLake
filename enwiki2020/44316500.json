    "text": "Inocybe bongardii is an agaric fungus in the family Inocybaceae. It was originally described as a species of Agaricus by German botanist Johann Anton Weinmann in 1836. Lucien Qu\u00e9let transferred it to the genus Inocybe in 1872. It is a common species with a widespread distribution. Fruit bodies grow on the ground, often in clay soils, and typically with broadleaf trees. The fruit bodies are suspected to be toxic, as they contain muscarine. ==See also== *List of Inocybe species ==References== ==External links== * bongardii Category:Poisonous fungi Category:Fungi described in 1836 Category:Fungi of Europe Category:Fungi of North America ",
