    "text": "Richard \"Rick\" Allen (born September 24, 1963), also known by the ring name Sunny Beach, is an American retired professional wrestler and promoter. He is perhaps best known for his tenure in the Universal Wrestling Federation where he was one-half of Wet N' Wild with Steve Ray. As the promotion's top \"babyface\" tag team, Wet N' Wild battled Cactus Jack and Bob Orton, led by manager \"Coach\" John Tolos, with their feud concluding at the company's first PPV event UWF Beach Brawl in 1991. He was also the final UWF SportsChannel Television Champion before the company folded. Allen began his career in the World Wrestling Federation where he was a featured preliminary wrestler from 1988 to 1992. He had stints in other wrestling promotions including, most notably, the American Wrestling Federation, Global Wrestling Federation, International Championship Wrestling Alliance, International World Class Championship Wrestling and Stampede Wrestling. Allen also wrestled overseas for All Japan Pro Wrestling, the Americas Wrestling Federation and World Wrestling's Stars. ==Early life== Allen was born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida.

Allen made his first WWF television appearance on the October 8th episode of WWF Superstars where he and Rusty Riddle took on The Rockers (Marty Jannetty and Shawn Michaels) at the Market Square Arena. Allen joined \"Iron\" Mike Sharpe on the October 16 episode of WWF Wrestling Challenge in a losing effort against The Young Stallions (Jim Powers and Paul Roma) at Louisville Gardens. Allen spent the rest of the month in bouts against Dave Peterson and Lanny Poffo. He also faced Casey at Madison Square Garden on the October 11 episode of WWF Prime Time Wrestling. On the October 29th episode of WWF Superstars, Allen once again took on The Rockers with tag team partner Brian Costello at the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum. He and Costello also wrestled The Powers of Pain (The Barbarian and The Warlord), accompanied by The Baron, the following week on WWF Wrestling Challenge. Allen's last WWF appearance was on October 10, 1988, against Jim Powers at Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton, Alberta. ===Stampede Wrestling (1989)=== Allen was befriended by The British Bulldogs while in the WWF and was brought to Calgary, along with Don Muraco, The Moondogs and The Power Twins (David Power and Larry Power), when they became the bookers for Stampede Wrestling.

He was one of the wrestlers recruited by promoters Rob Russen and Pete Lucic when they started the International Wrestling Association in Girard, Ohio. On August 27, 1990, Sunny Beach and The Terminator became the inaugural IWA Tag Team Champions after defeating The Motor City Madmen in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The team defended the belts until Sunny Beach left the promotion a month later and was replaced by Rage. ===Universal Wrestling Federation (1991)=== Allen joined the Universal Wrestling Federation in early 1991. He wrestled as \"Sunny Beach\", a \"surfer boy\" gimmick complete with a neon green wet suit and surfboard. Allen's first appearance on UWF television was on the January 28, 1991 episode of UWF Fury Hour, where he defeated Mike Williams. On the February 25 episode of UWF Fury Hour, at the Penta Hotel, Allen wrestled Bob Orton. Near the end of the bout, Orton's manager, \"Coach\" John Tolos, began attacking Allen while the referee was distracted and saw Steve Ray came to Allen's rescue. Cactus Jack followed Ray into the ring moments resulting in a four-way brawl. In the post-match interview, Tolos introduced Cactus Jack as the newest member of his stable and began a feud with the two young wrestlers lasting nearly three months. The duo proved popular with the UWF audience, one of its few homegrown stars, and who quickly became the promotion's top \"babyface\" tag team. They had their first tag team match together on the March 4, 1991 episode of UWF Fury Hour against The Power Twins. The team was dubbed Wet N' Wild by Captain Lou Albano during an interview on \"Capt. Lou's Corner\" the following week. Allen and Ray finally met Bob Orton and Cactus Jack on the March 18 episode of UWF Fury Hour which ended in a time-limit draw. A rematch held the following week ended in a double-disqualification. On April 26, Allen lost to Cactus Jack in a no-disqualification match at Plainedge High School. Coach Tolos also recruited The Power Twins in his war against Wet N' Wild. The two teams met at Universal Studios on the May 13 episode of UWF Fury Hour. Ray initially wrestled both twins in a handicap match as his partner was supposedly stranded at the airport. Allen later appeared in the ring while The Power Twins were double-teaming his partner and attacked them with his suitcase. In the post match interview, the team accused John Tolos of preventing Allen from arriving at the arena. Wet N' Wild later came to the rescue of Malia Hosaka when she was thrown out of the ring by The Blackhearts. On May 26, Allen served as a guest co-host on Pro Wrestling Spotlight, a WEVD radio program, with John Arezzi. In addition to taking live callers and discussing pro wrestling news, they also interviewed both former WWF Women's Champion The Fabulous Moolah and Allen's then rival Cactus Jack. On the June 3 episode of UWF Fury Hour, Wet N' Wild and The Power Twins fought to a double- disqualification at the Hotel Pennsylvania. Allen and Ray's feud with Coach Tolos' stable was finally settled at UWF Beach Brawl, the promotion's first- ever PPV event, with Wet N' Wild defeating Bob Orton and Cactus Jack. Tolos was suspended in a cage over the ring to prevent the manager from interfering in the match. Cactus Jack, who was pinned by Allen, was blamed for the loss and attacked by Orton after the match. In spite of the PPVs failure, \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams counted Allen among the most talented wrestlers on the card. Wet N' Wild were broken up shortly after due to personal issues between Ray and promoter Herb Abrams. Their last appearance on UWF television on the June 10 episode of UWF Fury Hour against Brian Donahue and The Messenger. ===Global Wrestling Federation (1991)=== A few weeks after Beach Brawl, Wet N' Wild appeared in the Global Wrestling Federation. The two wore bright and flashy wrestling tights and brought inflatable beach balls with them to the ring. Their female fans were referred to as \"beach bunnies\". They were among the 24 tag teams competing in a two-day tournament at the Dallas Sportatorium to crown the first-ever GWF Tag Team Champions. They defeated Chico Torres and El Azteca in the opening rounds on July 26, 1991, but were eliminated in the second by The Royal Family (Jack Victory and Rip Morgan). ===All Japan Pro Wrestling (1991)=== Allen was one of several U.S. independent stars invited to tour with All Japan Pro Wrestling.

He also wrestled for numerous independent promotions in the Northeastern United States and briefly ran his own promotion, All-Star Championship Wrestling, in Staten Island. One of Allen's shows featured a wild brawl between Cactus Jack and himself which later aired on local television. ===American Wrestling Federation (1991\u20131992)=== It was during this period that Allen became involved with the American Wrestling Federation as a booker and performer. Allen's brief tenure as booker was criticized by both Mike Lano and AWF owner Gordon Scozzari. The promoter, in particular, claimed it was Allen's poor relationship with local wrestlers that forced him to import more expensive talent from outside the Northeast region. Scozzari also blamed the wrestler for losing the original heavyweight title alleging Allen had loaned it to then champion Paul Orndorff without his knowledge. Orndorff told Allen he wanted to use it in a TV commercial with Hulk Hogan but failed to return it. On December 16, 1991, on the AWF's second television taping in Lowell, Massachusetts, Allen and Jeff Gaylord wrestled Bob Orton and Barry Horowitz, accompanied by manager Ronnie P. Gossett, in the co-main event. He and Gaylord continued teaming together and later became the promotion's first tag team champions.

In February 1992, the team traveled to Puerto Rico's Americas Wrestling Federation where they were billed as the \"AWF International Tag Team Champions\".

A year later, Allen was among the original UWF alumni to appear for the promotion's final PPV at the MGM Grand Arena. On September 23, 1994, at UWF Blackjack Brawl, Allen defeated Dr. Feelgood (with Missy Hyatt) via disqualification to win the vacant UWF SportsChannel Television Championship.
