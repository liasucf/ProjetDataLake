    "text": "The Wright State University 2019 faculty strike was a strike organized by the Wright State chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in response to employment conditions imposed by the university. The strike began on January 22, 2019, after nearly two years of failed contract negotiations between the AAUP and the Wright State University administration. The strike ended on February 10, 2019. At a length of twenty days, it was one of the longest faculty strikes in the history of U.S. higher education. University President Cheryl B. Schrader received widespread criticism for her handling of the strike and stepped down from her position as a result. ==Background== ==Lead-up to Strike== ==Strike== On January 22, 2019, following almost two years of failed contract negotiations and unexpected employment conditions imposed by the administration, the Wright State chapter of the American Association of University Professors began a strike that would ultimately become the second-longest public university strike in U.S. history. Most of the 560 unionized faculty participated in the strike. Striking faculty and other supporters picketed entrances to the university. Protesters chanted for resumed negotiations, and for Schrader \"to go.\" The strike received national attention, and the faculty union garnered widespread support from other universities, alumni, and lawmakers. Many letters of support were addressed to Schrader personally. Schrader and her administration ultimately received much criticism for how the stike was handled, especially after the faculty union ended up getting many of their demands. Schrader had remained publicly optimistic in the face of the strike, downplaying the liklihood of the strike and its potential impact on the university. She gave the assurance that \"classes will continue\" during the strike, with the caveat that some might be \"consolidated.\" When the strike began, Schrader kept the university running, instructing students to \"go to class,\" even as an online petition called for her resignation. Schrader reportedly took over teaching two courses herself. Despite such efforts made by the university, there were widespread reports from students that their classes had no instructors, or that \"covered\" classes provided minimal or inadequate instruction. The effect of the strike on the students was apparently profound, as reflected in social media posts. Many students expressed frustration about being \"caught in the middle\" between the striking faculty and the administration. Some students said they felt betrayed by the university; others expressed concern about the effect the strike was having on the reputation of the institution and how it would affect the value of their degree. One student said students were being \"bombarded with information\". Messages to students were later described as \"confusing and sometimes intimidating.\" A number of students joined the picket lines alongside the faculty, although they were reportedly discouraged from doing so by threats against their financial aid. Near the end of the strike, the AAUP chapter president said between 75 and 250 students picketing with the striking faculty every day. There were also independent protests by students. Two separate student protests were held outside Schrader's office. The second, which occurred on day 16 of the strike, was a round-the-clock \"sit-in\" by some 30 students. The students had a list of demands, which included tuition reimbursement for course time lost. The demonstration ended after 42 hours, when Schrader agreed to meet with the students. Throughout the strike, Schrader and the administration continued to publicly downplay the impact it was having on the university, maintaining that 80 percent of classes were covered. A February 6 statement added that the number was \"climbing\" as more union faculty returned to the classroom. The faculty union disputed this, noting all the problems that they're having just running basic classes.\u201d Some university statements did indeed seem inconsistent with university actions. On the third day of the strike, Schrader stated the university was \"open and operating largely without issue,\" in spite of the widespread student complaints. That same day her administration filed a complaint with the Ohio State Employee Relations Board (SERB) asking that the strike be declared illegal. When the board ruled that the strike could continue, she stated that the union's actions were \"having a significant toll.\" As the strike entered its third week, the true impact of the strike became more evident. The university advertized nationally for \"long term\" adjunct faculty in more than 80 fields, apparently to replace striking faculty. The school also began cancelling some \"specialized\" courses, which affected advanced students near graduation. It was reported that approximately 3,500 students had been affected by cancelled classes. While the university offered advising sessions to affected students, the faculty union asked Ohio Governor Mike DeWine to intervene, citing a belief that the administration was \"losing touch with reality.\" The faculty union became increasingly vocal in their accusations of \"union busting.\" === Deal to End the Strike === With pressure mounting to end the strike, and no deal in sight, a federal negotiator was brought in. On Sunday February 10, day 20 of the strike, after a long weekend of negotiating, the faculty union and the administration negotiators reached a tentative agreement to end the strike. The faculty returned to work on Monday February 11. \"Both parties made substantial concessions to help move the university forward together,\" Schrader said. The faculty union admitted it made some \"serious financial concessions,\" such as agreeing to no pay raises until 2021, but kept protections on job security, workload, merit pay, and perhaps most significantly, the right to bargain over health care. On the whole, the faculty union hailed the agreement and considered the strike a success. ==Aftermath== ==Notes== ==References== Category:2019 labor disputes and strikes Category:Education labor disputes in the United States Category:Labor disputes in Ohio Category:Labor relations in Ohio ",
