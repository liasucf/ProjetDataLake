    "text": "I. C. Massim (or Ioan C. Massimu; 1825-1877) was a Romanian linguist and a founding member of the Romanian Academy. According to Theodor Massim, his great-grandson, I. C. Massim was born Ion Floricel in the village of M\u0103xineni, near the Danube port of Br\u0103ila as the son of a country priest. He changed his name to Maxim, derived from the name of his birthplace, and signed his books as I. C. Massimu. The crowning achievement of Massim's linguistic career was the 1875 publication, together with August Treboniu Laurian, of the first complete dictionary of the Romanian language, a monumental work that included two volumes of words of Latin origin and a comprehensive glossary of words \"of foreign, dubious or unknown origin\".
