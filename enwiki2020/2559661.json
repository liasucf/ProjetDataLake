There's a director's cut version of the movie featuring additional 17 minutes of footage and alternative cut of the dance scene at competition. ==Plot== Former acclaimed dancer Na Young-sae (Park Gun-hyung) attempts to make a comeback after his opponent, Hyun-soo (Yoon Chan), purposely injures him at a dance competition. At the suggestion of dance studio manager Ma Sang-doo (Park Won-sang), Young-sae then brings to Korea Jang Chae-ryn (Moon Geun-young), an ethnic Korean from China whom he presumes is a renowned, talented dancer. To his surprise, Young-sae learns Chae-ryn knows nothing about dancing and her soon-to-be married, older sister, Jang Chae-min, is the talented dancer. With only three months until the national dance championship, Young-sae trains Chae-ryn, vowing to turn her into a world-class dancer. ==Cast== * Moon Geun- young as Jang Chae-min * Park Gun-hyung as Na Young-sae * Park Won-sang as Ma Sang-doo * Yoon Chan as Jung Hyun-soo ==Awards and nominations== ;2005 Grand Bell Awards * Nomination \u2013 Best Actress \u2013 Moon Geun-young * Nomination \u2013 Best New Actor \u2013 Park Gun-hyung * Nomination \u2013 Best Costume Design \u2013 Lee Ji-young ;2005 Blue Dragon Film Awards * Nomination \u2013 Best New Actor \u2013 Park Gun-hyung ;2005 Korean Film Awards * Best New Actor \u2013 Park Gun-hyung ==Critical reception== The film received mixed to negative reviews.
