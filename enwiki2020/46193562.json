    "text": "|} The Webster Cup Chase is a Grade 2 National Hunt chase in Ireland which is open to horses aged five years or older. It is run at Navan over a distance of 2 miles (3,219 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late March or early April. The race was first run in 2000, as the Navan Commercials Truck Importers Chase. From 2003 until 2010 it was known as the An Uaimh Chase (An Uaimh is Irish for Navan) and was awarded Grade 3 status in 2004. The race was awarded Grade 2 status in 2011 and renamed as the Webster Cup Chase. It was run over 2 miles and 4 furlongs until 2017 but was reduced to its current distance in 2018 when Fairyhouse and Navan agreed to swap the distances of their two Graded Chases scheduled for the spring, leading to the creation of the Devenish Chase. ==Winners== {| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\" |- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\" | style=\"width:36px\" | Year | style=\"width:160px\" | Winner | style=\"width:30px\" | Age | style=\"width:180px\" | Jockey | style=\"width:180px\" | Trainer |- | 2000 | Danoli | 12 | Shay Barry | Thomas Foley |-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |2001Cancelled due to foot-and-mouth crisis |- | 2002 | Moscow Express | 10 | Ruby Walsh | Frances Crowley |- | 2003 | Rince Ri | 10 | Ruby Walsh | Ted Walsh |- | 2004 | Rathgar Beau | 8 | Shay Barry | Dusty Sheehy |- | 2005 | Native Upmanship | 12 | Conor O'Dwyer | Arthur Moore |- | 2006 | Watson Lake | 8 | Paul Carberry | Noel Meade |- | 2007 | Nickname | 8 | Ruby Walsh | Martin Brassil |- | 2008 | Sher Beau | 9 | Andrew McNamara | Philip Fenton |- | 2009 | Royal County Star | 10 | David Casey | Tony Martin |- | 2010 | Glencove Marina | 8 | Ruby Walsh | Willie Mullins |- | 2011 | Hughies Grey | 7 | Mick Darcy | Mervyn Torrens |- | 2012 | Tranquil Sea | 10 | Barry Geraghty | Edward O'Grady |- | 2013 | Sumkindasuprstar | 9 | Ben Dalton | John O Clifford |- | 2014 | Bog Warrior | 10 | Paul Carberry | Tony Martin |- | 2015 | Felix Yonger | 9 | Ruby Walsh | Willie Mullins |- | 2016 | Smashing | 7 | Johnny Burke | Henry de Bromhead |- | 2017 | A Toi Phil | 7 | Ruby Walsh | Gordon Elliott |- | 2018 | Great Field | 7 | J S McGarvey | Willie Mullins |- | 2019 | Darasso | 6 | Barry Geraghty | Joseph O'Brien |- | 2020 | Castlegrace Paddy | 9 | Bryan Cooper | Pat Fahy |} ==See also== *List of Irish National Hunt races ==References== *Racing Post: **, , , , , , , , **, , , , , , , , Category:National Hunt chases Category:National Hunt races in Ireland Category:Navan Racecourse ",
