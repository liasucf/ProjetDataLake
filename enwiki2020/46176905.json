    "text": "Monet painted 37 works of Venice which he began during his stay in the city in 1908. These include a series of canvases of the Grand Canal. He had the habit of studying the same subject in a varying light, at different times of the day, which resulted during his career in many distinct series, like for example the Water Lilies series, Poplar series, Rouen Cathedral series, Haystacks series and Charing Cross Bridge series. During his stay in Venice, Monet's accommodation was on the Grand Canal, firstly in the Palazzo Barbaro and secondly in a hotel nearby.The hotel's name was the Britannia: it has since changed. See Westin website He painted six views of this stretch of the waterway, near the church of Santa Maria della Salute. He also painted individual buildings on the Grand Canal such as the Palazzo Dario. ==List of the paintings== * All works listed are described as Painting - oil on canvas . * The Catalog Nos are as defined by Daniel Wildenstein in the Monet: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:0.5em; text- align:left\" !

This was a rare occurrence because no museum owns or exhibits more than two in a permanent collection. The three paintings exhibited were the examples from the following collections: * Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco * Nahmad Collection, Monaco ==See also== * Le Grand Canal * San Giorgio Maggiore, Monet series ==References== Category:Paintings of Venice by Claude Monet Category:Series of Claude Monet paintings Category:Churches in art Category:Water in art ",
