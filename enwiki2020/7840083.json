    "text": "The Iowa International Center (previously known as the Iowa Council for International Understanding) is a non-profit organization based in Des Moines, Iowa. == History == The organization was founded in 1938 based on the work of volunteers assisting World War II refugees. In 1941, the center partnered with a group of community organizations to sponsor a Panamanian student\u2019s trip to Iowa, a venture that led to the formation of the Pan American Board of Education. In the 1940s, this organization sponsored 150 college students from Panama and changed its name to the Iowa Children\u2019s Institute of Language and Culture. Elinor Robson was hired as director. In the 1950s, the leaders of the Children\u2019s Institute decided that building a cultural and international awareness was a task that needed a broader objective, and again, they changed the name of the organization to the Boards of International Education (BIE). Throughout the 1960s the name changed to the Des Moines Area Council for International Understanding. The council\u2019s translation service became actively engaged in both emergencies and business work. In 1976, the Council joined the National Council for International visitors (now called Global Ties), placing it, for the first time, in a national network of agencies to receive and schedule international visitors from the United States information agency. Over thousands of emerging international leaders and industry professionals have visited Iowa through this program. The organization joined the National Council for International Visitors in the 1970s, placing it for the first time in a national network of agencies to receive and schedule international visitors from the United States Information Agency. Over 4,000 international guests have visited Iowa through this program.http://iowainternationalcenter.org/about/history/ In 1978, Thomas Grouling was hired as Executive Director and served the Council until June 1992. The name Iowa Council for International Understanding was adopted by the board in December, 1992. Dr. Judy Conlin served as Executive Director of the Iowa International Center from 2008 until January 2017. Patricia Grote is the current Executive Director. In August 2011, the Iowa Council for International Understanding changed its name to the Iowa International Center to better capture and describe the scope of its services and programs. The organization has resided in several locations around Des Moines, and is currently in the Merle Hay Mart. == Current operations == ===Education=== ===Meredith- Iowa International Center International Dialogue Series=== The Iowa International Center, in conjunction with Meredith Corporation, facilitates a monthly conversation on international issues with experts in various fields, which are designed to explore the interdependent relationship between global events and local actions.
