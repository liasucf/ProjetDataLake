    "text": "The Copland River is a river on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand. It flows for from its headwaters in the Southern Alps to its confluence with the Karangarua River. The headwaters of the Copland lie only northwest of Aoraki / Mount Cook in a valley overlooked by the peaks of Mount Sefton and Mount La Perouse. A popular tramping track follows the river and leads to the Welcome Flat hot springs. The track leads onto the Copland Pass and the Copland Glacier. The river lies within the Westland Tai Poutini National Park. ==References== Category:Westland District Category:Rivers of the West Coast, New Zealand Category:Westland Tai Poutini National Park Category:Rivers of New Zealand ",
