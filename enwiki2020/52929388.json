    "text": "The House of Cash was a house and museum in Hendersonville, Tennessee, devoted to the life and work of Johnny Cash. It was located at 700 Johnny Cash Parkway, and is closed. Cash did not live there, however; he and his wife lived nearby at 200 Caudill Drive in Hendersonville which was Cash's home from 1968 until his death in 2003. The museum fell into disrepair toward the end of Cash's life, when it was featured extensively in the music video for Cash's version of the song \"Hurt\" in 2002. In accordance with Cash's will, his house of residence was sold after his death in 2003. Barry Gibb purchased the property; while it was under renovation, it burned down in an accidental fire in 2007. A new, unrelated Johnny Cash Museum was opened in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2013. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Sumner County, Tennessee Category:Johnny Cash ",
