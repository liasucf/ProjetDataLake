    "text": "Pierre-Louis Lions (;CORE Fields Medal Talk: Pierre-Louis Lions on Mean Field Games born 11 August 1956) is a French mathematician. He is a recipient of the 1994 Fields Medal. ==Biography== His parents were Jacques-Louis Lions, a mathematician and at that time professor at the University of Nancy, who became President of the International Mathematical Union, and Andr\u00e9e Olivier, his wife. He graduated from the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure in 1977. Refusing to take the agr\u00e9gation in Mathematics, he chose to carry out research in applied mathematics and received his doctorate from the University of Pierre and Marie Curie in 1979. Lions received the Fields Medal, for his work on theory of nonlinear partial differential equations, in 1994 while working at the University of Paris-Dauphine. He was the first to give a complete solution to the Boltzmann equation with proof. He was an invited professor at the Conservatoire national des arts et m\u00e9tiers (2000).Pierre-Louis Lions, \u00ab Analyse, mod\u00e8les et simulations \u00bb, Universit\u00e9 de tous les savoirs, 4, 86-92, \u00c9ditions Odile Jacob, Paris, 2001. He is a doctor honoris causa of Heriot-Watt University (Edinburgh), Narvik University College (2014), and of the City University of Hong-Kong and is listed as an ISI highly cited researcher. He holds the position of Professor of Partial differential equations and their applications at the Coll\u00e8ge de France in Paris as well as a position at \u00c9cole Polytechnique. In the paper \"Viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations\" (1983), written with Michael G. Crandall, he introduced the notion of viscosity solutions. This has had an effect on the theory of partial differential equations. In 1986, Lions received the Prix Paul Doistau\u2013\u00c9mile Blutet. ==Bibliography== * * * * * Pierre-Louis Lions, Equations aux d\u00e9riv\u00e9es partielles et applications, Cours et travaux du Coll\u00e8ge de France, Paris, 2002-2015.
