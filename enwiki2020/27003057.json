His older brother, Chase, is also a professional baseball player. D'Arnaud also has a younger sister, Lindsey. A fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers growing up, his favorite player was Mike Piazza.

He was also awarded an ABCA/Rawlings High School Gold Glove award in 2007. D'Arnaud had committed to play college baseball for the Pepperdine Waves of Pepperdine University after high school, the same school for which his brother played, but was selected by the Philadelphia Phillies in the supplemental first round of the 2007 Major League Baseball draft, the 37th overall pick. He chose to void his college commitment and signed a minor league contract for $832,500. ==Professional career== ===Philadelphia Phillies=== In 2007, d'Arnaud started his professional career with the Philadelphia Phillies' Rookie League affiliate, the Gulf Coast League Phillies.

Wallace was then traded to the Houston Astros for center-field prospect Anthony Gose.
