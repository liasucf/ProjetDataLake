According to an MTA (Metropolitan Transit Authority) study of pedestrian traffic in New York City, almost 1,800 (1,000 during off-peak travel times) pedestrians passed by the sound booth per hour. Over 60 DJs and hosts provide 16 hours of free live programming a day, in two-hour show blocks, seven days a week. Programming features a mix of music, news, comedy and commentary. Music ranges from indie to new wave to coldwave to hip hop and post punk to vintage jazz, funk and soul to house, techno and ambient electronic. EVR supports the free radio movement. == History == East Village Radio was established in June 2003, and broadcast on the airwaves at 88.1 FM. After an article in The New York Times described the station, the FCC sent a cease-and-desist letter as the station was unlicensed to use the airwaves. Due to the difficulty of obtaining new FM licenses, the decision was made to make EVR an internet radio station. The East Village Radio storefront studio back in 2010. Some time after this, it was decided to move the studio from its original location above a restaurant to a storefront booth on First Avenue in Manhattan. This was seen as a way of reconnecting EVR with the East Village community since the station was no longer literally on-the-air. East Village Radio's DJ line-up included British multi-platinum artist and producer Mark Ronson. One of its final guests before closing and relaunching was artist and Vector Gallery creator/curator JJ Brine on the AndewAndrew show. East Village radio has now relaunched on Dash Radio and is live as of June 3, 2015. ==Shows/DJs == *Accidental Rhythm /Jason Eldredge *Adequate Underground / Oblib, Jubei, Ged (w/ guests Cuba & Nano) *Analog Soul /Jacky Sommer & DatKat *Andrew Andrew Sound Sound /AndrewAndrew *Authentic Sh!t / Mark Ronson *Atlantic Tunnel / Ed Rogers & Gaz Thomas *Ballers Eve / DJ Dirrty, Minski Walker & Kat Daddy Slim *Beyond Beyond is Beyond / Mike Newman *Chances with Wolves / Mikey Palms, DJ Kool Kear & Kray *Chillin' Island / Dapwell from Das Racist / Despot (rapper) *Coalition Chart Show / Mike Joyce *Contemporary Adult / Michael Hirsch *Death By Audio / Edan Wilber *Delancey Music Service / Stretch Armstrong & Eli Escobar *Fast Forward Reverse / TimmyG *Forty Deuce / Geebee, Keene & ExPee *Fat Beats / Monster *Friction on EVR / Bobby Friction *Jamaica Rock / Queen Majesty *Gay Beach / Tedward *Gold River Show / Jerry Jones *Guilty Pleasure / DJ Elhaam *Happy Medium / Lane LaColla *JetLag / Andy Rourke *La D\u00e9cadanse / Melody Nelson *Minimal Wave / Veronica Vasicka *Modern Products / Harris Smith *Morricone Youth / Devon E.
