It is based on the South Korean television show King of Mask Singer created by Seo Chang-man. Televisa is the second network in the Americas to obtain the franchise of said program. It is hosted by Omar Chaparro. It premiered on Las Estrellas on August 25, 2019. The series has been renewed for a second season, that premiered on October 11, 2020. Filming of the second season began on August 24, 2020. ==Format== A group of celebrities hide behind a character and, week after week, a panel of researchers will try to discover who is behind the mask. Competitors are matched in face-off competitions and perform a song. The studio audience votes for their favorite performance and the masked singer with the most votes is safe for the week, while the celebrity with the least votes is nominated for elimination. The panelists decide which of the nominated celebrities will not continue in the competition. The eliminated celebrity removes their mask to reveal their identity. ==Panelists and host== The panelists of the first season consisted of actor and comedian Adri\u00e1n Uribe, singer Yuri, actress and comedian Consuelo Duval, and singer Carlos Rivera. Adri\u00e1n Uribe did return for season two and was replaced by Juanpa Zurita. The show is hosted by Omar Chaparro. Occasionally, there are guest panelists that appear as the fifth panelist. In the first season, they were football coach Miguel Herrera (episode 6), actress Paz Vega (episode 7), and actress Michelle Renaud (episode 7). ==Series overview== == Ratings == == Awards and nominations == {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Award ! scope=\"col\" | Category ! scope=\"col\" | Nominated ! scope=\"col\" | Result |- | 2020 | TVyNovelas Awards | Best Reality | Miguel \u00c1ngel Fox | |- |} ==Spin-offs== ===\u00bfQui\u00e9n es la m\u00e1scara?
