Theocrit. i. 65; Ellis, p. l. a daughter of Uranus and Gaia or of Briareus. Stephanus of Byzantium says that according to one account Aetna was a daughter of Oceanus.Stephanus of Byzantium, s.v. \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03c7\u03b7; Ellis, pp. l-li. Simonides said that she had acted as arbitrator between Hephaestus and Demeter respecting the possession of Sicily. By Zeus or Hephaestus she became the mother of the Palici.Servius. ad Aen., ix. 584. Mount Aetna in Sicily was believed to have derived its name from her and under it Zeus buried Typhon, Enceladus, or Briareus. The mountain itself was believed to be the place in which Hephaestus and the Cyclops made the thunderbolts for Zeus.Euripides. Cyclops, 296.Propertius, iii. 15. 21.Cicero.
