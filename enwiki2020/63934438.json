He was one of the first victims in the battles for the liberation of Smederevo. As a respectable merchant, \u0110u\u0161a was a legitimately elected leader of the insurgent Serbs from the Smederevo nahija and he led his people in the fight against the Turks. Petar Joki\u0107, the commander of Kara\u0111or\u0111e's personal guard, states that there were 200 of them, and with Dr. Miroslav Djordjevi\u0107 the number of insurgents increased to 400, and that, according to an Austrian report, on 25 February, Kara\u0111or\u0111e was in Azanja with his main detachment. He was also accompanied by Belgrade Metropolitan Leontije, Pavle (Stojko) Krivoku\u0107a of Ad\u017eibegovac and other insurgents. The same author says \"how Kara\u0111or\u0111e was in close contact with \u0110u\u0161a and that he first transmitted Kara\u0111or\u0111e's orders to the Pozarevac nahija through him. According to these instructions, the uprising spread in eastern Serbia as well.\u201d\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0440 \u0408\u043e\u043a\u0438\u045b After a year and a half of war, the Duke of Smederevo, \u0110u\u0161a Vuli\u0107evi\u0107, died bravely in a battle with the Turks on the bridge (near today's church) in Smederevo. Historian Milan Mili\u0107evi\u0107 writes that he was first buried in the gate near the Old Church in Krnjevo and that the following year the remains were transferred to the Pinosava Church, between Azanja and Ku\u0161atko, where they are still located today. The death of Duke \u0110u\u0161a and the conquest of Smederevo was sung in the song \"Kara\u0111or\u0111e took Smederevo\" by Joksim Novi\u0107-Oto\u010danin back in 1864. \u0416. \u0422\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043d, \u041c\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u0442\u0430\u043c\u0458\u0430\u043d\u0430, \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0421\u0430\u0434, 2014, 15 After the death of Duke \u0110u\u0161a, the people of the Smederevo and region chose Vujica Vuli\u0107evi\u0107, \u0110u\u0161a's younger brother, as their leader. Today, \u0110u\u0161ina Street in Belgrade carries the name in his honour. ==Origin== According to scholar Borivoje Drobnjakovi\u0107 (1890-1961), the Vuli\u0107evi\u0107 family hailed from Kosovo. The grandfather of Vujica and \u0110u\u0161a had two sons, Vuli\u0107 and \u0110or\u0111e, so the Vuli\u0107evi\u0107s and \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107s were born. Upon arrival, their houses were in the area of today's village center, more precisely in the lower part near the bus station. Like other insurgent leaders, they were engaged in the trade before the uprising, thus gaining capital to fight the Turks. This put them in a position to be one of the organizers of the First Serbian Uprising. == References == Category:1771 births Category:1805 deaths ",
