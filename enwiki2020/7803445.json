    "text": "Rowing at the 1936 Summer Olympics featured seven events, for men only. The competitions were held from 11 to 14 August on a regatta course at Gr\u00fcnau on the Langer See. The competition was dominated by the hosts, Germany, who medaled in every event and took five of the seven gold medals. The final race, men's eights, was won by a working-class United States team from the University of Washington who, in what had become their trademark, started slow and outsprinted the competition to an exceedingly close finish, with only one second separating the top three finishers at the end of a six-and-a-half minute race.Michael J. Socolow, Six Minutes in Berlin, Slate.com. Published 23 July 2012. Retrieved 23 July 2012.
