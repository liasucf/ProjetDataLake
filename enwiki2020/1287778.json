    "text": "Thompson is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created by redistribution in 1968 from parts of Churchill and Rupertsland, and has formally existed since the provincial election of 1969. Thompson is located in the north of the province. It is bordered by Rupertsland to the north and east, Keewatinook to the north and west, and The Pas to the south. The city of Thompson was incorporated shortly before the riding's creation, and is its only major urban centre. Almost half of the riding's residents live in that community. The riding's population in 1996 was 19,349. In 1999, the average family income was $56,402, and the unemployment rate was 12.60%. The riding's character is primarily working-class, with 17% of its economy coming from the mining sector. Forty-two per cent of the riding's residents are aboriginal, the third highest rate in the province. Thompson is usually considered safe for the New Democratic Party, which represented the riding almost continually since its creation. The current MLA, New Democrat Danielle Adams defeated Progressive Conservative Kelly Bindle in the 2019 election. Bindle had previously defeated longtime MLA Steve Ashton as part of his party's landslide victory in the 2016 election. Bindle was only the second Tory ever to win the seat, and the first since 1977. ==List of provincial representatives== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Name ! Party ! Took Office !
