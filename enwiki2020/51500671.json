In comparison with the classical single-barrier photodiode, he obtained high values of photosensitivity from 5 to 15 A / W, which is one - one and a half orders of magnitude higher than (0.5-1 A / W) in the known analogues. Dr. A.V. Karimov regularly participates at various part in high-profile international scientific conferences, including lectures and latest publicationsin in Prague, 13\u201317 October 2002, Berlin, 23\u201325 June 2003, Paris, 7\u201311 June 2004, Kiev and Odessa 2004-2007 at international conferences physical processes in phototransformator, photodiodes, phototransistors, and the problems of the physical processes in the pn-junctions. He was a member of the organizing committee of the conference held in Baku and Odessa (2004-2007 biennium) on Information and electronic technologies. Dr. A.V. Karimov was an active participant as a research manager of international projects UZB-31 \u201cDevelopment of solar energy photoconverters based on novel structures: ion- beam modified and diamond-like layers of polycrystalline silicon\u201d (01.04.2000-31.06.2002), and UZB-56(J) \u201cDevelopment and investigation of micro-layer photoconverters with InGaAs/GaAs and AlGaAs/GaAs heteroepitaxial junctions\u201d (01.10.2002-31.12.2004) jointly ith Ukrainian Science and Technology Center. The physical basics of the technology and original designs of multiple barrier photodiode structures with internal photoelectrical amplification were developed under his guidance in Uzbekistan in the early 90th [Karimov A.V.

Compared to the classical one-barrier photodiode structures, Dr. A.V. Karimov obtained high value of photosensitivity ranging from 5 to 15 A/V, which is by 1-1.5 fold higher than that (0.5-1 A/V) in the existing samples. Dr. A.V. Karimov, as a leading expert and professional in his field, he is listed in the Biographical Collection 10th Anniversary Edition of Who's Who in Science and Engineering/Marquis Who's Who in Science and Engineering, and also in International list of the International Biographical Centre Melrose Press Ltdhttp://www.internationalbiographicalcentre.com/ (registered in Great Britain under #965274 with an office at Saint Thomas Place, ELY, Cambridgeshire, CB7 4GG, Great Britain). He was admitted as an International scientist for the year 2008. At present Dr. A.V.
