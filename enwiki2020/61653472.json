This is a List of emeralds by size. ==Emeralds== Emerald is a gemstone and a variety of the mineral beryl (Be3Al2(SiO3)6) colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Beryl has a hardness of 7.5\u20138 on the Mohs scale. Most emeralds are highly included, so their toughness (resistance to breakage) is classified as generally poor. Emerald is a cyclosilicate. Emeralds in antiquity were mined in Egypt at locations on Mount Smaragdus since 1500 BCE, and India, and Austria since at least the 14th century CE. The Egyptian mines were exploited on an industrial scale by the Roman and Byzantine Empires, and later by Islamic conquerors. Mining ceased with the discovery of the Colombian deposits; only ruins remain.\"Romans organized the mines as a multinational business...\" Finlay, Victoria. Jewels: A Secret History (Kindle Location 3098). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. Colombia is by far the world's largest producer of emeralds, constituting 50\u201395% of the world production, with the number depending on the year, source and grade.Carrillo, V. (2001).

INGEOMINAS Emerald production in Colombia has increased drastically in the last decade, increasing by 78% from 2000 to 2010. The three main emerald mining areas in Colombia are Muzo, Coscuez, and Chivor.Emerald Mining Areas in Colombia , with location map of these three districts. Rare \"trapiche\" emeralds are found in Colombia, distinguished by ray-like spokes of dark impurities. Zambia is the world's second biggest producer, with its Kafubu River area deposits (Kagem Mines) about southwest of Kitwe responsible for 20% of the world's production of gem-quality stones in 2004.Behling, Steve and Wilson, Wendell E. (January 1, 2010) \"The Kagem emerald mine: Kafubu Area, Zambia\", The Mineralogical Record In the first half of 2011, the Kagem Mines produced 3.74 tons of emeralds. ==Notable emeralds== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !scope=\"col\" | Emerald !scope=\"col\" | Origin !Date !scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\" | Uncut size !Cut size !scope=\"col\" | Location !Ref |- |Bahia Emerald |Brazil |2001 | | | Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department | |- |Carolina Emperor |United States |2009 | | |North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, Raleigh | |- |Chalk Emerald |Colombia | | | |National Museum of Natural History, Washington | |- |Duke of Devonshire Emerald |Colombia | | | |Natural History Museum, London | |- |Emerald of Saint Louis |Austria | | | |National Museum of Natural History, Paris | |- |Gachal\u00e1 Emerald |Colombia |1967 | | |National Museum of Natural History, Washington | |- |Mogul Mughal Emerald |Colombia | | | |Museum of Islamic Art, Doha, Qatar | |- |Patricia Emerald |Colombia |1920 | | |American Museum of Natural History, New York | |- |Mim Emerald |Colombia |2014 | | |Mim Museum, Beirut | |} ==See also== *List of gold nuggets by size *List of individual gemstones ==Bibliography== Notes References * * * \\- Total pages: 240 * * \\- Total pages: 352 * * * Emeralds ",
