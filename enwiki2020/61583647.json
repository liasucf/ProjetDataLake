    "text": "The Institute for the Elderly and Social Services (IMSERSO) is an agency of the Government of Spain responsible for the management of social services that complement the benefits of the Social Security System, disability and retirement pensions, in its non-contributory modalities, as well as the exercise of the powers of the General State Administration in matters relating the elderly and dependent persons. The IMSERSO is categorized as a \"Management Entity of the Social Security\". Despite the large scope of work covered by the Institute, it is mostly known for its programs related to tourism and social thermalism for elderly. The main tourist destinations organized by IMSERSO are located within Spain, Portugal and Andorra. As of March 2019, the Institute provided services to almost 1.1 million people. The Institute is headed by a Director-General appointed by the Minister for Social Rights and 2030 Agenda after hearing the Council of Ministers. The current director-general is Luis Alberto Barriga Mart\u00edn. == History == Before of the creation of the Institute, it existed a protection and social services system with limited benefits, with no specialized institutions and personnel and very close to the private- religious fields. The IMSERSO was created in 1978 under the name of National Institute for Social Services (INSERSO) by assuming the powers of the Recovery and Rehabilitation Service for the Physically and Psychically Handicapped of the Social Security (SEREM) and the Pension Assistance Service (SAP). Since its creation, many of the social assistance competencies have been decentralized, creating local social services in 1985 and regional services in 1988. It was during these period when the IMSERSO transferred to the Spanish regions its Residential Centers and Pensioners' Homes. In 1997, due to the increase in migratory flows to Spain, and the increase in the immigrant population, the government delegated into the Institute the provision of social services to immigrants, renaming the agency to Institute for Migrations and Social Services (IMSERSO). In 2004, a second delegation of powers occurred, assuming the Institute the powers on elders, the social protection for dependent people and population aging. The Institute was renamed \"Institute for the Elderly and Social Services\" (Instituto de Mayores y Servicios Sociales). In 2020, the agency was integrated in the Ministry of Social Rights and 2030 Agenda. ==Organization chart== Currently, the Institute for Elderly and Social Services is integrated in the Ministry of Health through the Secretariat of State for Social Services.
