He is the fourth of five children and grew up in France. ==Life== Dor\u00e9mus wrote his first pieces of poetry before the age of ten. He also began to learn to play the guitar. He spent his first years between Metz and Avignon to finally settle down in Paris at 21, after passing a cinematographic Performing Arts bachelor's degree in 2001, and finishing his first novel.\"A 20 ans je me voyais plut\u00f4t \u00e9crivain, mais mon premier roman \u00e9tait une catastrophe. Je me suis mis alors plus s\u00e9rieusement \u00e0 faire des chansons. J\u2019ai vite pig\u00e9 que cette discipline \u00e9tait carr\u00e9ment pour moi. \u00c7a m\u2019a cadr\u00e9, recentr\u00e9.\" He had his first concerts in 2003 within the very close Parisian fields. His songs, mostly influenced by Eminem or the famous French singer-songwriter Renaud, very popular since the '70s, often describe his bipolarity between music and literature, Philippe Djian being his favourite author concerning the latest. The texts regularly deal with a recurring character called \"Benito\" or \"Adesias Benito\", a hardly hidden allegory for himself. His first album, Pas en parler (French for \"[I'd rather] Not talk about it\"), came to be known by the professionals,Article du journal Chorus and among them, Renaud in 2005, thanks to the singer Sarclo, who introduced him to him. Renaud enjoyed it and decided to produce it (label EMI). He also did a personal cover of Rien \u00e0 te mettre (French for Nothing to wear) in his 2006 album Rouge sang. In October 2007, his last album Jeunesse se passe (French for The Youth is passing by, label Ceci-Cel\u00e0, EMI Group) received good reviews, especially from the daily newspaper Lib\u00e9ration.Article de Lib\u00e9ration He also recently appeared on the 15-year-old music TV-Show TaratataThe Artist's page on the Show's website ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * 2004 : Pas en Parler # J'apprends le m\u00e9tier # Conditionnel # Rien \u00e0 te mettre # Ca ne me manquait pas # J'\u00e9cris faux, je chante de la main gauche # Les bulles # 17 ans # Ce que \u00e7a fait de la revoir # Retour \u00e0 l'envoyeur # Beaupadre # Un poison # Pas en parler # Accord\u00e9on pour cinq d'entre elles # Je viens du cirque * 2007 : Jeunesse se passe # J'\u00e9cris faux, je chante de la main gauche # Je m'en rappelle pas # J'apprends le m\u00e9tier(acte 1) # Rien \u00e0 te mettre # L'enfer (acte 2) # 17 ans # Pas \u00e0 me plaindre # Deux dans mon \u00e9gotrip(acte 3) # Beaupadre # Un poison # Un arracheur de sacs # Les bulles # Paris ==References== ==External links== * * Beno\u00eet Dor\u00e9mus on Myspace.com Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:French singer-songwriters Category:People from Besan\u00e7on Category:21st-century French singers ",
