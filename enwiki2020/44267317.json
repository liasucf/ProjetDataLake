She successfully advocated for five tobacco-control laws, including a complete ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship; a ban on smoking in all public and indoor work areas; the implementation of graphic warnings on cigarette packaging; and an increase in tobacco taxes. According to the World Health Organization's 2011 report on tobacco, Ukraine moved from 4th to 29th in the world for prevalence of smoking, due largely to efforts lead by Hopko.

Hopko was one of a group of young MPs who rode the 2014 revolutionary wave of youth into the upper echelons of Ukrainian politics. The group's supporters considered them less corruptible, as they weren't part of the country's old elite networks that consisted mostly of men who'd gained wealth and power through backdoor deals after the fall of Communism. Supporting the ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, Hopko stated: \"It is a demonstration of readiness to build a rule-of-law state in which it is possible to punish for crimes against humanity and genocide.\" On 31 August 2015, Hopko and four other MPs of the Self Reliance party voted in support of amendments to the Ukrainian Constitution that would lead to decentralization. As a result, she and the other MPs were ousted from the party \"with great honor\". Hopko stated that the constitutional amendment was \"an important step towards comprehensive change in Ukraine\" and contained \"no concessions to Russia\". Hopko is now a non-affiliated People's Deputy. In May 2017, she co- sponsored a bill in the Ukrainian parliament requiring 75% of national television programming, and 50% of local programming, to be in the Ukrainian language. Hopko and her associates believe that widespread use of the Russian language undermines Ukrainian statehood.
