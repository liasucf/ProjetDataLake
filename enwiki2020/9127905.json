    "text": "\"Atr\u00e9vete-te-te\" () is a Grammy-nominated reggaeton song by Puerto Rican urban duo Calle 13 from their eponymous debut album Calle 13, released in February 2006, by White Lion Records. It is one of the duo's best known songs. It was a hit single in many Latin American countries. The video for this single won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2006. This song is featured in the soundtrack of Grand Theft Auto IV. The song was later named the second best single of the decade by Latin music website Club Fonograma. ==Song information== \"Atr\u00e9vete-te-te\" is based on a Colombian cumbia beat and a clarinet riff also typical of traditional music from Colombia's coast. It was especially popular in that country. The lyrics found in the song contain Spanglish words such as \"est\u00e1rter\" and anglicisms such as lighter and wiper are used to create rhymes, a reflection of the use of English on the island due to Puerto Rico's status as a Commonwealth in free association with the United States.CIA - The World Factbook - Puerto Rico accessed on November 13, 2006. The song has been featured in an MTV Tres commercial. It was used in a version of the song for Manuel Rosales' 2006 presidential campaign in Venezuela. Rosales' campaign motto was Atr\u00e9vete. ==Pop culture references== The song makes several references to different pop culture themes, such as: * The Japanese videogame Street Fighter * The British rock band Coldplay * The American punk rock band Green Day * The 2003 Quentin Tarantino film, Kill Bill: Volume 1 * The music genre, Latino punk Ag\u00fceyban\u00e1, the last indigenous cacique in Puerto Rico's history is also mentioned, as are the cities of Bayam\u00f3n and Guaynabo, Puerto Rico (this last one mentioned as to reinforce the song subject's aloofness and scorn for Latino and Puerto Rican influences, versus her liking of the rather \"foreign\" references mentioned above). The dancers on the song's video are Marilyn Monroe lookalikes, each dressed in blonde wig and a skimpier version of Monroe's famed The Seven Year Itch dress. ==Credits and personnel== * Vocals: Ren\u00e9 P\u00e9rez * Production: Eduardo Cabra * Lyrics: Ren\u00e9 P\u00e9rez * Instruments: clarinet, bass, dembow * Mixing: Colin Michaels ==Chart performance== The song became a big success on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart, peaking at number 15.[ Billboard.com - Artist Chart History - Calle 13] It also peaked at number six on the U.S. \"Latin Tropical Airplay\" chart.[ Top Music Charts - Hot 100 - Billboard 200 - Music Genre Sales - Calle 13 - Atrevete te te] ===Charts=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (2006) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot Latin Songs | style=\"text- align:center;\"|15 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Latin Tropical Airplay | style=\"text-align:center;\"|6 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Latin Rhythm Airplay | style=\"text-align:center;\"|20 |- |Venezuela Top Latino (Record Report).
