    "text": "The California Climate Credit is a program administered by the California Public Utilities Commission and the California Air Resources Board in which ratepayers receive a refund on their gas and electricity bills. The refund is paid in biannual installments for residential customers and monthly for small businesses. The funding for the refund comes from the utility providers who pay a carbon tax for polluting the air, and the refund is the dividend portion of the carbon fee and dividend program created by the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006. The refund represents only a portion of the carbon tax collected, with the rest of the funds collected going towards programs to fight climate change. The program is only applied to customers of for-profit utilities. Municipal utilities do not pay the carbon tax that funds the program. The program was announced in 2014 with the first payments made in 2015. The program is set to expire in 2020. For residential customers, each customer gets the same credit amount, regardless of how much energy the customer consumes. For small businesses, the credit is proportional to the amount of energy used. The credit is normally given twice a year, in April and October. In 2020 the credit was modified slightly in response to COVID-19. The credit in April was disbursed as normal, but the October credit was disbursed 50% in May and 50% in June. ==References== ==External links== * California Climate Credit at the California Public Utilities Commission * California Climate Credit at the California Air Resources Board Category:Climate change policy Category:Carbon finance Category:Environment of California Category:Air pollution in California Category:Politics of California ",
