Following the 2018 Yilan train derailment in November, premier William Lai expanded the purview of the ASC via a directive. Proposed legislation regarding the ASC reformation began the draft process later that month. It took the form of an amendment to the Organizational Act of the Aviation Safety Council. The amendments were approved by the Legislative Yuan in April 2019. The renaming of the council to the Taiwan Transportation Safety Board was announced in July 2019, and took effect on 1 August 2019, with Young remaining in the chairmanship role. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Taiwanese mechanical engineers Category:National Taiwan University alumni Category:University of New South Wales alumni Category:Taiwanese expatriates in Australia Category:21st-century engineers Category:20th-century engineers Category:National Taiwan University faculty Category:Political office-holders in the Republic of China on Taiwan Category:21st-century Taiwanese politicians Category:Engineering academics ",
