    "text": "Auto-Destructive Art (ADA) is a form of art coined by Gustav Metzger, an artist born in Bavaria who moved to Britain in 1939. Taking place after World War II, Metzger wanted to showcase the destruction created from the war through his artwork. This movement took place in England and was launched by Metzger in 1959.Jeffries, S. (2012, November 26). Gustav Metzger: 'Destroy, and you create' Retrieved October 13, 2016, from https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/26/gustav-metzger-null- object-robot This term was invented in the early 1960s and put into circulation by his article \"Machine, Auto-Creative and Auto-Destructive Art\" in the summer 1962 issue of the journal Ark. == History == This movement sparked after World War I. Before World War I, artists approached art very traditionally, with paint and paper. As seen in Impressionism and Expressionism, artwork before war was inspired by everyday life. After World War I, artists began to introduce new styles of art that used different medias and techniques. Cubism and Dadaism were at the heart of these new techniques. Auto-Destructive Art follows these newer techniques by taking everyday objects and causing damage. Destructive art is similar to Dadaism in the way it rejects past concepts in order to not only redefine art, but also to bring light to issues. Although similar to Dadaism, ADA was a movement of its own due to the style and time period. After World War II, many artists turned to Abstract Expressionism, but ADA differed with its focus on destruction. == Influences == Auto-Destructive Art was highly influenced by World War II. After the many casualties and mass destruction, people around the world were distraught and horrified. In comparison to World War I, World War II had a different influence on art due to the extensive use of aircraft and the introduction of nuclear weapons. These weapons greatly inspired artists to approach art using new means such as corrosion, stress, or heat. ADA represents the war and its casualties. Artists in this time period wanted to explore issues in new ways. In order to explore these issues in the industrial society, Metzger encouraged artists to work with scientists and engineers.Beaven, K. (2012, July 16).

By allowing stress and natural forces to create damage after an initial mark, the art is auto- created. This represents how man sparked and created destruction. The destruction also represents the chaos caused by the government. Politics was a major driving force of ADA artists. In interviews, Metzger expressed his dislike of politics and commercialism. Metzger believed the \u201caesthetic of revulsion\u201d would add to the idea of the corrupt, capitalist system.Home, S. (1988, January 1). The Assault on Culture by Stewart Home chapter on auto- destructive art. Retrieved October 18, 2016, from https://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ass/auto.htm By damaging the art itself, Metzger is able to question the idea of what art is. He goes against the idea of egocentrism in the artistic world. Metzger believed that in order to bring light to the corruption in politics, he must remove himself and his work from the art.Lewis, B.

They wanted to withdraw from mass production, commercialism, and manufacturing. == Artists == Gustav Metzger grew up during the Holocaust, which greatly inspired his artwork. In 1943, Metzger lost his parents to Nazi attacks. Metzger quotes \u201cFacing up to the Nazis and the powers of the Nazi state coloured my life as an artist.\u201d Metzger would spark the damage of the art piece to represent mankind\u2019s destruction. He then allowed natural forces to take over which symbolized how mankind\u2019s spark can result in much more destruction than intended. Metzger later used his art to speak out against the violence we do to each other and nature.Flailing Trees Gustav Metzger. (2009, July 3\u201319).

Latham used stacks of books to create towers that he then set on fire. This demonstration was controversial due to the recent Nazi attacks and book burnings that took place. Latham noted that he was not against the content in the books, but rather the idea that books are the only source of knowledge. Beaven, K. (2012, July 16).

This piece included a machine that created noise, paintings, and smoke before being stopped by a firefighter. The piece was meant to self-destruct and although was not able to complete its actions, still succeeded as an art piece. Tinguely believed this piece symbolized a freeing from material because once the performance was over, it was cleaned up and there was nothing left.Tinguely, J., & Landy, M. (2009, September 1).

Jeff Keen, a film-maker, included forms of destruction in his \u201ccollaged films\u201d. Keen would cut and edit scenes from pop culture, comics, and other films to create \u201cmulti-screen projections\u201d. His films were seen as disconnected and jumbled which confused viewers. Keen symbolizes destruction in his cut and edit skills of previous works. By using other sources and editing them together, Keen has destructed the old and created something new.Beaven, K.

Metzger used bricks, cloth, and other objects as a base for his work. He then used multiple types of harming materials such as acid or fire to create the destruction. For one piece, Metzger threw hydrochloric acid on a nylon sheet and noted that while the acid did destroy the sheet, it did create shapes.Jeffries, S. (2012, November 26).

Metzger was against the art dealer system and aimed to get Auto-Destructive Art publicly funded, but the government would not provide funding. Metzger was against art dealing because dealers were uninterested in the \u201cfundamental technical change\u201d. This resulted in Metzger and John Sharkey to organize DIAS in 1966, which was a volunteer based event that showcased different art forms from diverse individuals across the world. One significant performance at this event was Yoko Ono\u2019s \u201cCut\u201d piece.Home, S. (1988, January 1). The Assault on Culture by Stewart Home chapter on auto-destructive art.

Band member Keith Moon dramatically followed suit by placing explosives into his drums (at some points nearly blowing himself to pieces).Amazing Journey: The Story of The Who In 2013, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., would open an exhibit giving focus to destruction in art.
