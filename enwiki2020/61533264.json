Elias Jackson \"Lucky\" Baldwin (April 3, 1828 \u2013 March 1, 1909) was a pioneer of California business, an investor, and real estate speculator during the second half of the 19th century. He earned the nickname \"Lucky\" Baldwin due to his extraordinary good fortune in a number of business deals.
