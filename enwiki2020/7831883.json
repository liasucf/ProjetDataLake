Norrish spent his early diplomatic career in Wellington and Paris, with a posting to Paris from 1955 to 1958. In 1961, Norrish was posted to New York City as New Zealand\u2019s deputy permanent representative to the United Nations. Norrish was appointed New Zealand\u2019s Ambassador to the European Community, in Brussels, in 1967. In 1972, he became Acting High Commissioner to London, before returning to Wellington as Deputy Secretary of Foreign Affairs in 1973. During his time as Deputy Secretary, he was considered to be more closely aligned to the United States' foreign policy position than his Secretary, Frank Corner. In 1978, Norrish became New Zealand\u2019s Ambassador to the United States in Washington, D.C., and Mexico. In 1980, Norrish was appointed New Zealand Secretary of Foreign Affairs, a post he held until his retirement in 1989. During that period, Norrish was the key foreign policy official during New Zealand\u2019s withdrawal from ANZUS and the nuclear ship controversy. Norrish is understood to have warned Prime Minister David Lange not to antagonise British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher by participating in the Oxford Union debate, and was responsible for implementing New Zealand's nuclear-free policy against his personal instincts. Norrish was Secretary of Foreign Affairs when French secret agents bombed the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior in 1985. In retirement, Norrish served as Chairman of New Zealand On Air, and the France- New Zealand Friendship Fund. ==Honours== In the 2002 Queen's Birthday and Golden Jubilee Honours, Norrish was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for public services. ==References== *An eye, an ear and a voice: 50 years in New Zealand\u2019s external relations edited by Malcolm Templeton (1993, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Wellington NZ) Category:1926 births Category:Ambassadors of New Zealand to the United States Category:Ambassadors of New Zealand to Mexico Category:Ambassadors of New Zealand to the European Union Category:Living people Category:New Zealand public servants Category:University of Canterbury alumni Category:High Commissioners of New Zealand to the United Kingdom Category:People from Ashburton, New Zealand Category:Companions of the New Zealand Order of Merit Category:People educated at Ashburton College Category:People educated at Christchurch Boys' High School ",
