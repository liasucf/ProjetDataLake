Industrial action is usually organized by trade unions or other organised labour, most commonly when employees are forced out of work due to contract termination and without reaching an agreement with the employer. Quite often it is used and interpreted as a euphemism for strike or mass strike, but the scope is much wider. Industrial action may take place in the context of a labour dispute or may be meant to effect political or social change. This form of communication tends to be their only means to voice their concerns about safety and benefits. == Types == *Strike *Occupation of factories *Work-to-rule *General strike (mass strike) *Slowdown (or Go-slow) *Overtime ban *Blue flu ==See also== *Nonviolent resistance *Civil resistance ==References== Category:Labor disputes ",
