    "text": "Jackson W. Crawford (born August 28, 1985) is an American scholar and poet who specializes in Old Norse. As of August 2017, he teaches at University of Colorado, Boulder (previously at University of California, Berkeley and University of California, Los Angeles). He has a YouTube channel with over 100,000 subscribers, where he posts videos twice per week. ==Biography== Crawford\u2019s research focuses on the history of the Scandinavian languages, specializing in Old Norse, Modern Icelandic, and Nynorsk. He earned an M.A. in Linguistics from the University of Georgia, specializing in Indo-European languages, and a Ph.D. in Scandinavian Studies from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, specializing in Old Norse. The focus of his Ph.D. dissertation, as well as several published and forthcoming articles, were on colors in the languages. He has argued, among other things, that Old Norse bl\u00e1r meant blue (rather than black), and that the language classified warm colors with an intriguing system that distinguished ideal reds with a distinct term, rau\u00f0r, but lumped non-ideal reds and other warm colors into a vague category weakly focused on yellow, bleikr. Crawford is the Instructor of Nordic Studies, and Coordinator of the Nordic Program. Crawford teaches courses in the Old Norse language, Norse mythology, and the history of the Scandinavian languages. He received B.A. in Classics and Classical Languages, Literatures, and Linguistics from Texas Tech University; an M.A. in Linguistics from the University of Georgia (focusing on Indo-European historical linguistics); and a Ph.D. in Scandinavian Studies from the University of Wisconsin, Madison (specializing in Old Norse). Crawford has published several books, including The Poetic Edda: Stories of the Norse Gods and Heroes, intended for the use of undergraduate students and general readers, published in 2015 by Hackett Publishing Company. This was followed in 2017 by The Saga of the Volsungs: With the Saga of Ragnar Lothbrok, also published by Hackett Publishing Company. In 2019, he published his book The Wanderer's H\u00e1vam\u00e1l, which serves as a dual language edition of the poem H\u00e1vam\u00e1l with his own commentary for each stanza. The appendix of this book features his poem The Cowboy H\u00e1vam\u00e1l. He has also published creative writing in both English and Norwegian. ==References== == External links == * \"Tatt\u00fa\u00edn\u00e1rd\u01ffla saga: If Star Wars Were an Icelandic Saga\" * Colorado.edu Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Old Norse studies scholars Category:Translators from Old Norse Category:University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison alumni Category:University of California, Berkeley College of Letters and Science faculty Category:University of California, Los Angeles faculty Category:University of Colorado Boulder faculty Category:American YouTubers Category:Translators of the Poetic Edda ",
