    "text": "The 1964 Oakland Raiders season was the team's fifth in both Oakland and the American Football League. The campaign saw the team attempt to improve upon its impressive 10\u20134 record from 1963. The Raiders' efforts, however, would prove fruitless. The team staggered out to an abysmal 1\u20137\u20131 record over its first nine games. While the Raiders pulled themselves together over the final five games of the season (in what amounted to a 4\u20130\u20131 run), their slow start ensured that they would miss the postseason for a fifth consecutive year. During the preseason, the Raiders played the Houston Oilers in Las Vegas at Cashman Field in the first professional football game ever held there. 56 years later, the Raiders would relocate to the Las Vegas metropolitan area. ==Season schedule== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
