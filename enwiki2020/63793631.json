    "text": "Ian Watson Is a former ice hockey goaltender who played for the California Golden Bears before the team lost its varsity status in 1949. Watson was the starting goaltender beginning in at least 1947\u201348 and was selected as the best college goaltender for that season. He repeated the performance the following year, but due to the demise of all of Cal's local rivals by 1949, the team was shuttered. Watson does not appear to have played organized hockey since. ==Awards and honors== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Award !
