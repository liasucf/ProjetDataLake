She studied at the Kala Bhavan in Shantiniketan, and at the Government College of Art and Craft, Kolkata, where she completed a Master of Arts in painting. She went to Paris and studies print-making under Monsieur Ceizerzi. She is a member of an extended family of eminent artists: her husband, Paresh Maity; uncle Sakti Burman who lives and works in France, though he is considered an Indian artist; and her cousin, Maya Burman. In 2005, she helped create an exhibition called \"The Family\" featuring work of all these artists. Burman works mainly in watercolor, using rich strong hues and bold themes with a mythic element\u2014strange hybrid animals with human heads, female figures. She has won several prizes for her art (which?). Her work has been exhibited in India, and overseas. == Exhibitions == Exhibitions 2010'Art Celebrates 2010: Sports and the City', represented by Art Alive Gallery at Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi to coincide with the hosting of the Commonwealth Games 2010'Summer Show 2010', Centre of International Modern Art (CIMA), Kolkata 2010 Annual Exhibition, Chawla Art Gallery, New Delhi 2008'Moderns', Royal Cultural Centre, Amman, Jordan organized by Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi in collaboration with Embassy of India, Amman, Jordan 2004 Annual Exhibition, Art Musings, Mumbai 1991 Annual Exhibition of Graphics, Paintings and Sculptures, Gallery BF-\u00ad\u201014, Kolkata 1987 International Triennale, Intergraphic, Germany 1986 Bharat Bhavan Biennale, Bhopal 1983 - 85 National Exhibition, Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi National Exhibition, Lalit Kala Akademy, Kolkata All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society (AIFACS), New Delhi Solo Exhibitions Selected Solo Exhibitions 2014\u2018Gazing into Myth\u2019, by Gallery Sumukha, Hong Kong 2010\u2018Fables and Folklore\u2019, presented by Art Musings at Jehangir Art Gallery, Mumbai 2010\u2018The Mythical Universe\u2019, Art Alive Gallery, New Delhi 2006\u2018Sacred Feminine\u2019, Art Musings, Mumbai 2005\u2018 Fairytales and Laments: The Mythology of Jayasri Burman\u2019, Arts India, Palo Alto 2004 Jehangir Art Gallery, Mumbai 2002 Gallery Sumukha, Bangalore 2004, 2000, 1999, 1997 Gallerie Ganesha, New Delhi 1992 Pundole Art Gallery, Mumbai == Awards & Recognition == Jayasri Burman has been previously honoured by the Department of Posts & Ministry of Women & Child Development by the government of India in the year 2007.
