    "text": "Host is the seventh studio album recorded by British band Paradise Lost. The singles \"So Much Is Lost\" and \"Permanent Solution\" both have music videos released; in an interview, Holmes and Mackintosh explained that the videos were higher budget compared to other videos they made.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_4PzbxRkuQ Due to an injury, Gregor Mackintosh often played keyboards instead of guitar while touring the album with his guitar technician playing his guitar parts. The album saw the band moving further away from their previous metal sound to something more akin to a melancholy style of synthpop incorporating downtempo, leftfield, and trance electronic styles. Songs were constructed primarily of programmed drums and synthesizer melodies, with simple, rock-style guitar added for choruses. Vocalist Nick Holmes resolved to simple melodies with his clean singing style, often doubled and harmonized; the resultant material resembled crossover acts like Psykosonik. While the album was critically well received, opinion about it continues to be split. Holmes commented on this album in 2007, stating: Aedy said Host is the \"darkest\" Paradise Lost album, but noted the band wasn't happy with the production;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNHTZxlOjLo the album was remastered and re-released in 2018. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ===Paradise Lost=== * Nick Holmes \u2013 lead vocals and lyrics * Gregor Mackintosh \u2013 lead guitar on (1\u201311, 13\u201316), keyboards, programming, string arrangements on (1, 2, 4, 6, 10 & 13) and all music * Aaron Aedy \u2013 rhythm guitar, lead guitar on \"Year of Summer\" * Steve Edmondson \u2013 bass guitar * Lee Morris \u2013 drums & backing vocals ===Additional Personnel=== ====Cellists and Other String Arrangements==== *Audrey Riley \u2013 strings arrangements & cello on (1, 4 & 10) *Sally Herbert \u2013 string arrangements on (2, 6 & 13) *Dinah Beamish \u2013 cello on (2, 6 & 13) ====Violists==== *Sue Dench on (1, 4 & 10) *Claire Orster on (2, 6 & 13) ====Backing vocals==== *Shereena Smith \u2013 chanting on \"Harbour\" & backing vocals on (4, 6 & 13) ====Production==== *Howie Weinberg \u2013 mastering *Steve Lyon \u2013 engineering, mixing & programming *Matt Cullen \u2013 engineer assistance ====Album Design==== *Paul Postle \u2013 photography *Stylorouge \u2013 design & art direction ====Violinists==== ;On (1, 4 & 10) *Chris Tombling *Leo Payne ;On (2, 6 & 13) *Anne Stephenson *Gini Ball *Jocelyn Pook *Julia Singleton *Sally Herbert ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !
