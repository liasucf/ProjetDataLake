It is a transfer point between Line 14 of the Paris Metro and the RER C. It is situated on the Paris\u2013Bordeaux railway. ==History== The station was opened in 1998 when Line 14 was first opened. Its architecture is the work of Antoine Grumbach, a different architect from the one who designed the other stations of Line 14. In the hall where one transfers between the two transit lines, the steps of the stairs are arranged in the arc of a circle and are marked with the letters of different humanistic writings. From the opening of Line 14 until 25 June 2007, this station functioned as the line's southern terminus. Further work extended the line to a new station to the southwest, Olympiades, which opened on 26 June 2007. It is expected that the line will eventually be extended to the station Maison Blanche and will take over the southern branch of Line 7 that terminates at Villejuif \u2013 Louis Aragon. When the station was opened, the station Mass\u00e9na of the RER C was closed and replaced by this station in order to permit the transfer between the m\u00e9tro and RER lines. ==Nearby attractions== This station serves the area known as Tolbiac, between the Seine and the train tracks of the network of the Gare d'Austerlitz, which includes the BnF and the headquarters of the R\u00e9seau Ferr\u00e9 de France, the French equivalent of the UK's Network Rail), and the BnF's large new cinema, etc. From this station, it is possible to reach on foot via the rue de Domr\u00e9my the church of Notre-Dame de la Gare, on the Place Jeanne-d'Arc. == Station layout == {| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 valign=top|G |style=\"border- top:solid 1px gray;\" width=100 valign=top|Street Level |style=\"border- top:solid 1px gray;\" width=400 valign=top|Exit/Entrance |- |style=\"border- top:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 valign=top|B1 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=100 valign=top|Mezzanine |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=400 valign=top|to Exits/Entrances |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 rowspan=4 valign=top|B2 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border- left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2| |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100|Northbound |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=390|\u2190 toward Saint-Lazare |- |Southbound | toward Olympiades \u2192 |- |style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border- bottom:solid 1px gray;text-align:center;\" colspan=2| |} ==Gallery== File:Station de Bibiotheque Nationale Ligne 14 - Quais 02-03-06.jpg|Line 14 platforms at Biblioth\u00e8que Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand ==See also== *List of stations of the Paris M\u00e9tro *List of stations of the Paris RER ==External links== * * Category:Paris M\u00e9tro stations in the 13th arrondissement of Paris Category:R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional stations Category:Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand Category:Railway stations in France opened in 1998 ",
