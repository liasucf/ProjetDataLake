It was noted that the border remained closed, except to humanitarian relief and the efforts of Serbia and Montenegro in this regard. The Council underlined the importance it attached to there being no provision of military assistance to Bosnian Serb forces. At the same time, streamlined procedures adopted by the Committee established in 724 (1991) were welcomed, concerning legitimate humanitarian assistance requests and transshipment on the Danube River. Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the international sanctions placed on Serbia and Montenegro were suspended until 18 September 1995. The resolution also called for the mutual recognition between the states of the former Yugoslavia, with recognition between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro being an important first step in the process. The situation would remain constantly under review by the Security Council. Resolution 1003 was adopted by 14 votes to none against, with one abstention from Russia. ==See also== * Bosnian War * Breakup of Yugoslavia * Croatian War of Independence * List of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1001 to 1100 (1995\u20131997) * Yugoslav Wars ==References== ==External links== * *Text of the Resolution at undocs.org 1003 1003 Category:1995 in Yugoslavia Category:1995 in Bosnia and Herzegovina 1003 Category:July 1995 events ",
