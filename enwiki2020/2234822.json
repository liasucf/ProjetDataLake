Born in Fleury-les-Aubrais in Loiret, France, Carr\u00e9 studied at l'\u00e9cole Saint-Joseph and the coll\u00e8ge Sainte- Croix de Neuilly before entering the Dominican order in 1926 and being ordained a priest in 1933. Not long thereafter, he was to edit, from 1936 until 1939, the Revue des Jeunes. Under the German Occupation, following the capitulation of the French government to the Nazis during the Second World War, Carr\u00e9 aided those persecuted by the Vichy government, regardless of their religion or ethnicity; for this, he was awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur and the Croix de guerre. Both before and after the war, he preached many sermons and participated in conferences in France and abroad (especially in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, and Belgium). He preached the Lenten sermons many times at Notre Dame de Paris, and in 1964, Paul VI called him to present spiritual exercises at the Vatican. He was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise on 26 June 1975, replacing Jean Cardinal Dani\u00e9lou, a post he held until his death on 15 January 2004 at Ancourt, in France. ==External links== *A bibliography of his works Category:1908 births Category:2004 deaths Category:French Roman Catholic priests Category:French Dominicans Category:Members of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise Category:Grand Officiers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur Category:20th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:Burials at Montparnasse Cemetery ",
