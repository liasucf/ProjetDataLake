    "text": "The Ch\u00e2teau de Breteuil The Ch\u00e2teau de Breteuil (previously called the Ch\u00e2teau de Bevilliers) is a ch\u00e2teau situated in the Vall\u00e9e de Chevreuse in Yvelines department of France, to the south-west of Paris. The ch\u00e2teau was designated a monument historique in 1973. The family of the Marquis de Breteuil gave three ministers to the Kings of France. The ch\u00e2teau is still owned by the de Breteuil family. The design is similar to the Ch\u00e2teau de Dampierre-en-Yvelines by Jules Hardouin-Mansart. ==Relations with England== On March 12, 1881, the Marquis Henri de Breteuil organized a secret meeting at the Ch\u00e2teau with the Prince of Wales, future King Edward VII, and L\u00e9on Gambetta, President of the Chamber of Deputies. This constituted the beginnings of the Entente Cordiale. In 1912, another Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VIII and after his abdication Duke of Windsor, stayed with the Breteuil family for four months to improve his French. Five years later, Fran\u00e7ois de Breteuil played the significant role in the Prince's love life by introducing him to the Parisian courtesan Marguerite Alibert during the Great War. == See also == * List of Baroque residences ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Ch\u00e2teaux in Yvelines Category:Gardens in Yvelines Category:Historic house museums in \u00cele- de-France Category:Museums in Yvelines ",
