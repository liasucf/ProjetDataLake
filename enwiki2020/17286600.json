When talking about the songs on the album Perry said that she released the single \"Ur So Gay\" as an introduction to the album: ==Music and lyrics== ===Themes and influences=== Although Perry's musical style and way of composing ironic and bawdy songs has been heavily compared to the style of singers Avril Lavigne and Lily Allen, the singer was influenced by Queen and Freddie Mercury in particular. All songs on the album were written by Perry, assisted by musicians Greg Wells, Max Martin, Dr. Luke, Cathy Dennis, Desmond Child, Andreas Carlsson, Sam Hollander, Dave Katz, S*A*M and Sluggo, Ted Bruner, Scott Cutler, Anne Preven, Dave Stewart, and Glen Ballard. The album includes several tracks that tell stories \u2014 a balance of sad songs and happier tunes.

I've put everything into [this album] and I feel like it's my baby.\" ===Songs=== Perry performing \"I Kissed a Girl\" at the Life Ball in May 2009 in Vienna, Austria The opening track is the title track \"One of the Boys\", where Perry express that she does not want to \"be one of the boys of her love interest\", describing the song, Charles A. Hohman from PopMatters noted that \"she used to belch the alphabet and tape down her tits, but one summer, the tomboy lifestyle just didn't hold her interest, so she started 'studying Lolita religiously' and noticing guys noticing her.\" The second track is the lead single \"I Kissed a Girl\" generated some controversy, dealing with the subject of lesbianism.

Reviewing the song, editor CT from Billboard described it as \"a mid-'90s No Doubt pop/rock palette\". The fifth track is \"Mannequin\". \"Ur So Gay\" was composed as a tool of revenge by the singer on her ex-boyfriend, where Perry satirizes his exaggerated emo style and metrosexual attitude. It is a trip hop track with a moderate tempo. In the seventh track \"Hot n Cold\", Perry discusses the theme of uncertainty and the ups and downs of relationships. It is a synthpop song which utilizes guitars and synthesizers. \"If You Can Afford Me\" cops a mixed message about female materialism.

Perry performing the opening act for YouTube Live in 2008 Upon its release, the singer has been heavily criticized for her song, \"Ur So Gay\", considered by the site The New Gay to be homophobic. The author of the publication added, \"It's time to Katy Perry to stop talking nonsense\" because \"the song trots out a number of tired gay stereotypes to condemn one of Perry's ex-boyfriends and includes a paradoxical chorus\". Jane Czyzselska from The Guardian commented that \"Perry's song is a rather sweet, refreshing antidote to the avalanche of overtly sexualized boy- grinds-girl songs.\" She promoted the song in Portugal, and it was not very well received by the public. Her first single, \"I Kissed a Girl\", became a worldwide controversy. Despite the context, Perry mentioned several times that she does not define herself as heterosexual https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj9Ar0eX4AE.

So I went to hell.\" To promote the album Perry embarked on three tours: the Warped Tour 2008, her first solo world tour, the Hello Katy Tour, with 89 shows performed, and No Doubt's Summer Tour 2009 as its opening act. ==Singles== The album's lead single, \"I Kissed a Girl\" was released in late April and subsequently soared up the charts. \"I Kissed a Girl\" was a commercial success.

A highly positive review came from Kerri Mason of Billboard, who felt it was \"packed with potential hits.\" Blender argued, \"Perry's creative-writing-class punch lines don't always justify her self-congratulatory drag-queen tone. But she hiccups quirkily enough, and myriad big-name producers (from Dr. Luke to Glen Ballard) keep the new-wave synth hooks hopping.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic initially gave the album two out of five stars, remarking it \"sinks to crass, craven depths that turn One of the Boys into a grotesque emblem of all the wretched excesses of this decade\"; however, the rating was eventually upgraded to 3 and a 1/2 out of 5. Uncut wrote, \"Gwen Stefani should be nervous\", while Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine criticized Perry's vocal performances, and compared the title track to \"No Doubt's 'Just a Girl' sans personality and conviction\". Alex Miller of NME discouraged music consumers with \"even a passing interest in actually enjoying a record\" from buying it. Robert Christgau gave the album a two-star honorable mention in his Consumer Guide review, citing \"I Kissed a Girl\" and \"One of the Boys\" as highlights while writing, \"She stopped taping her 'suckers' down, and kissing her girlfriend was just an experiment, but trumpeting her vulnerability she's as loud and laddish as a hockey fan\". ===Year-end lists=== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- !
