    "text": "Cos\u00ec fan tutte is a 178-minute studio album of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's opera, performed by Jules Bastin, Philippe Huttenlocher, Kiri Te Kanawa, David Rendall, Frederica von Stade and Teresa Stratas with the Choeurs de l'Op\u00e9ra du Rhin and the Strasbourg Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of Alain Lombard. It was released in 1978. ==Background== The album omits some of Mozart's recitative, and also cuts two numbers in their entirety: No. 7, the duettino \"Al fato dan legge\" for Ferrando and Guglielmo, and No. 24, the aria \"Ah lo veggio\" for Ferrando.Stereo Review, August 1978, pp. 132-133 ==Recording== The album was recorded using analogue technology in May 1977 in the Palais de la Musique et des Congr\u00e8s, Strasbourg.Mozart, W. A.: Cos\u00ec fan tutte, cond. Alain Lombard, Erato CD 2292-45683-2, 1991 ==Cover art== The cover of the first CD version of the album, designed by Mister Brown, features a detail of J. Pillement's painting \"Les jardins de Benfica\" (1785), a work in the collection of the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs, Paris. ==Critical reception== Mozart painted by Joseph Lange in 1790 The musicologist Stanley Sadie reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in May 1978. Comparing it with rival recordings conducted by Herbert von Karajan and Karl B\u00f6hm, he acknowledged that these classic readings offered singing of a \"subtlety and poise\" that Alain Lombard's version could not equal. On the other hand, the new album's students at Don Alfonso's school for lovers came to their classroom with \"youthful timbre[s] and natural high spirits\" that were nicely appropriate to their roles. As Fiordiligi, Kiri Te Kanawa was \"magnificent\", singing \"in her best, creamiest voice\". Aristocratic in \"Come scoglio\" and meditatively introspective in \"Per piet\u00e0\", she infused her role with tenderness and feminity. Her only fault was that she sometimes sang slightly flat. Frederica von Stade's Dorabella was \"hardly less distinguished, with ample, broad phrasing, much well shaped detail in 'Smanie implacibili' and a graceful and spirited account of 'E' amore un ladroncello'.\" David Rendall, although sharing Te Kanawa's tendency to sing below the note, offered a Ferrando with the requisite honey for \"Un' aura amorosa\" and the requisite fire for \"Tradito, schernito\". Philippe Huttenlocher gave a \"very polished performance\" as Guglielmo, acting the part convincingly, using his words intelligently and bringing a laudable legato to \"Non siate ritrosi\". Jules Bastin's Alfonso was sung forcefully but without much expressiveness, a charge that could not be levelled at Teresa Stratas. Her Despina was vivid and extremely musical, but it was \"a pity that she felt the need to squeak and squawk so grotesquely in her impersonations of a doctor and a notary\". The chief failings of the album, though, had nothing to do with any of its soloists. The orchestral playing suffered from \"a lack of finesse\", and the conducting from a dearth of dramatic conviction and \"a general lack of sparkle\". Sadie did not take exception to Lombard's bias towards slow tempi, but he was disappointed that the album evinced no care over appoggiaturas. (A further instance of negligence was the clipping of bar 49 of \"Come scoglio\" by a clumsy editor.) Overall, the album was a good one, but not good enough to compete with the best of its many illustrious predecessors,Gramophone, May 1978, pp. 1929-1930 An unattributed portrait of Lorenzo da Ponte in the library of Columbia University J. B. Steane reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in July 1978. He was sad that it was one of those opera recordings in which excellence was betrayed by the mediocrity surrounding it. The excellence in question was provided by the two ladies from Ferrara. Kiri Te Kanawa sang Fiordiligi with an acute sensitivity to her music's meaning, her voice \"at its most beautiful, warm and well-rounded\". As Dorabella, Frederica von Stade was Te Kanawa's perfect foil, her timbre complementing the soprano's so well that their voices blended in their duets in a way that could hardly be bettered. But Teresa Stratas, although a vivid Despina, sang with a tone that gave little pleasure. As Guglielmo, Philippe Huttenlocher was \"inelegant\". As Ferrando, David Rendall sang with a piano tone that lacked focus and a forte that sounded muffled. And worst of all, Alain Lombard seemed unable to distinguish between passages where a slow tempo was heavenly and others where it was laughable. \"Instead of placing the partnership of Te Kanawa and von Stade in the place where it belongs, classic in freshness, beauty and character\", the album's flaws had in Steane's view consigned it to the margins of the Cos\u00ec fan tutte discography. \"You do not wear a diamond in a leaden ring.\"Gramophone, July 1978, p. 167 Vienna's Burgtheater, where Cos\u00ec fan tutte was first performed George Jellinek reviewed the album on LP in Stereo Review in August 1978. Like Sadie and Steane, he singled out Kiri Te Kanawa for especial praise, lauding her \"abundant musicality and tone of creamy richness throughout most of the range\". However, he thought that the cruel vocal assault course that Mozart had created for Fiordiligi had been difficult for her to negotiate. Frederica von Stade sang just as beautifully, and it was not her fault if her timbre was too like Te Kanawa's to allow an ideal degree of contrast between them. Teresa Stratas was an older Despina than some, and she took the comedy of her notary too far, but the gaiety of her approach was mostly enjoyable. The album's gentlemen were not quite as impressive as its ladies. As Ferrando, David Rendall had an \"agreeable and malleable light tenor\" but his technique sometimes left something to be desired. Philippe Huttenlocher was a solid but bland Guglielmo. Jules Bastin sang stylishly, but without either the force or the comfortable upper notes that an Alfonso needed. Recitatives were hampered by some pedestrian harpsichord continuo work. The orchestra, if not the most sumptuous of ensembles, played with warmth and accuracy and was blessed with some first-rate woodwinds. Alain Lombard's conducting was animated and accommodating, although it was marred by an unfortunate bias towards slow tempi. The album's audio quality, if \"not particularly spacious\", was perfectly acceptable. All things considered, though, Lombard's Cos\u00ec fan tutte could not really compete with alternative recordings conducted by Karl B\u00f6hm, Erich Leinsdorf or Georg Solti.
