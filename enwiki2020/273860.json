    "text": "Colony is the fourth studio album by Swedish metal band In Flames, released on 21 May 1999 via Nuclear Blast Records. It is the first In Flames album to feature the band's classic line-up; Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte switched to lead guitar to replace Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m and Daniel Svensson filled the drummer position left vacant by Gelotte. Peter Iwers became the new bass player, replacing Johan Larsson. With Anders Frid\u00e9n and Jesper Str\u00f6mblad remaining on vocals and rhythm guitar respectively, this lineup remained unchanged until 2010. ==Music== ===Lyrics and musical style=== The album deals with various aspects of religion, society, and spirituality, from the somewhat positive light of Embody the Invisible and The New Word, to the more negative Zombie Inc. and Scorn. Colony features a faster, tighter, and more energetic approach to the music than displayed on the previous album, Whoracle, though the song-writing approach is similar. ===Songs=== The title of the song The New Word is subject to debate. According to the track list on the back cover of the original 1999 release, the official In Flames web site, and the lyrics printed in the original 1999 CD booklet, the correct title is The New Word; however, according to the heading of the lyrics printed for the song in the original booklet, the track list on the 2004 re-release, and the official Nuclear Blast Records web site, the song is called The New World. The 2009 re-release Colony: Reloaded did nothing to clear up this issue, with the insert and the booklet containing the same inconsistency as the original 1999 release. The song's lyrics themselves, meanwhile, suggest that The New Word is indeed the correct title. \"Pallar Anders Visa\" means \"The Ballad of Anders the Thief\". It is also an instrumental, just like the bonus track, \"Man Made God\". The song Embody the Invisible appears in the soundtrack for the video game Tony Hawk's Underground. The tracks Behind Space '99 and Clad in Shadows '99 (which are only available on different issues of this album) are both remakes of the tracks first heard on Lunar Strain, although Behind Space '99 excludes the acoustic guitar outro present on the original version. ==Track listing== === Deluxe edition (2004) === Contains the following, in addition to the above tracks: * Photo gallery * Ordinary Story music video (directed by Tamara Jordan) * Computer wallpapers * A screensaver * Winamp skins * Song lyrics (contains numerous spelling errors) === Colony: Reloaded (2009) === The enhanced re-release contains the same bonus content as the 2004 deluxe edition. The original 1999 cover is brought back, and the back insert is custom-shaped to fit into the \"Super Jewel Box\" case that is used. ==Credits== ===In Flames=== *In Flames - arrangements, engineering and mixing **Anders Frid\u00e9n \u2013 vocals, lyrics (1\u20135, 7, 8, 10, 11) **Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte \u2013 lead guitar, co- composition (1\u20138, 10, 11, 13) **Jesper Str\u00f6mblad \u2013 rhythm guitar, all music, hammond organ **Peter Iwers \u2013 bass **Daniel Svensson \u2013 drums ===Additional personnel=== *Prophecies Publishing \u2013 publishing *Niklas Sundin \u2013 translation *Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m \u2013 hammond organ, slide guitar, engineering and mixing *Mikael Stanne - lyrics (\"Behind Space '99\" & \"Clad In Shadows '99\") *Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m \u2013 co-composition (\"Behind Space '99\" & \"Clad In Shadows '99\") *Kee Marcello \u2013 second guitar solo (\"Coerced Coexistence\") *Peter Wildoer \u2013 drum technician *Charlie Storm \u2013 programming *G\u00f6ran Finnberg \u2013 mastering *Andreas Marschall \u2013 front cover illustration *Flea Back \u2013 art direction ==References== Category:In Flames albums Category:1999 albums Category:Nuclear Blast albums Category:Albums produced by Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m ",
