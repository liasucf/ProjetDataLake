He also rode L'Escargot to victory in the Cheltenham Gold Cup the following year, this time beating Leap by 10 lengths. In 1973, Carberry was victorious on Inkslinger in the Champion Chase at the Cheltenham Festival. 1975 proved to be a great year for Carberry as he came home first in the Cheltenham Gold Cup, Aintree Grand National and the Irish Grand National. Ten Up in the Cheltenham Gold Cup was his third win in the race. His Aintree Grand National win was on L'Escargot when he beat Red Rum who was trying for a third successive victory in the race. His 1975 Irish Grand National success was on Brown Lad who he also rode to victory with in the following year. In 1980, Carberry rode Tied Cottage in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. The horse finished the race first but Tied Cottage was later disqualified for testing positive for a banned substance. When he retired from riding, he started training. His son Paul Carberry was also a jockey, when he won the 1998 Irish Grand National with BobbyJo and the 1999 Grand National. Prior to the victory in the 1999 Grand National, the last victory by an Irish trained horse was in 1975. ==Personal life== He married Pamela Moore in 1970.
