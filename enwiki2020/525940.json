    "text": "The Mouvement Souverainet\u00e9-Association (MSA, English: Movement for Sovereignty-Association) was a separatist movement formed on November 19, 1967 by Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque to promote the concept of sovereignty-association between Quebec and the rest of Canada. Formerly a member of the Quebec Liberal Party, Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque quit the party with a few hundred others after his proposal of a sovereign Quebec associated to the rest of Canada was rejected during a party convention. The MSA quickly began to move for a merger of all the independence movements in Quebec, which at the time were the Rassemblement pour l'ind\u00e9pendance nationale (RIN) and the Ralliement national (RN). In January 1968, the MSA published the manifesto Option Qu\u00e9bec. From April 19 to 21, it held its first Congr\u00e8s d'orientation with its 7300 members. The convention led to the publication of a groundwork document entitled Ce pays qu'on peut b\u00e2tir (This country that we can build) and the decision to create a new political party dedicated to Sovereignty-Association. From October 11 to 14, the MSA held its first national congress in Quebec City. The merger of the MSA and the RN created the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ). MSA leader Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque was elected president of the PQ, and RN leader Gilles Gr\u00e9goire became vice-president. On October 26 Pierre Bourgault, leader of the RIN, dissolved the party and invited its members to join the PQ. The short-lived MSA had served its purpose: sovereigntist forces in Quebec were united under a single party. Three elections later, the PQ won the 1976 provincial election, with historic consequences. ==References== ==See also== * Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois * Quebec Sovereignism * Politics of Quebec * List of Canadian political parties * Secessionist movements of Canada Category:Secessionist organizations in Canada Category:Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque ",
