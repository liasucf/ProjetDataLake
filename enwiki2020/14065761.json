Stanford Rees, opened up his doctor's office in Gunnison and began practicing Family Medicine. From that small office in 1932, the practice grew and Dr. Rees expanded and built a hospital in Gunnison in the 1940s. That hospital was the first hospital in the entire county of Sanpete. In 1970 the hospital moved to a new building and new location, which is the location where the hospital still resides.Id. The hospital experienced financial difficulties in the late 1980s to the early 1990s.Source: Utah Transparency Advisory Board Meeting Minutes of March 22, 2011 at page 4: \"When the hospital experienced financial difficulties in the late 1980s, early 1990s, it was realized that there needed to be some capital improvements to the facility to continue on. The hospital was organized as an inter-local agreement which was an agreement of the towns and cities in the Gunnison Valley to own and operate the hospital. They found that it was impossible to get funding from the normal sources for the capital improvements. They went to the Community Impact Board for funding and found that they would need to change their organization to a Special Service District. In 1994 they became a Special Service District and were able to apply for the loan and did receive the loan through the CIB for the capital improvements that were necessary for the hospital. \"One of the reasons the CIB agreed to give the loan on the hospital was because the citizens of Gunnison Valley voted to form the Special Service District for the hospital and they could be taxed as collateral on the loan.\" In 1994 the citizens of the area voted to support and back the hospital with tax payer funds by making the hospital a public entity in the form of a Special Service District formed under Utah's laws.Id.
