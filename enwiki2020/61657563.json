The ground was built in the 1950s to replace Old Wanderers, which had been built over in 1947, as Johannesburg's major cricket ground. The ground opened in 1956 and the first Test match was played on the ground the same year. The ground's first One Day International (ODI) was played in 1992 and its first Twenty20 International played in 2005.The Wanderers Stadium, CricInfo. Retrieved 2020-03-11.

In cricket, a five- wicket haul (also known as a \"five-for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement.Pervez MA (2001) A Dictionary of Cricket, p.31. Hyderabad: Sangam Books (India). This article details the five-wicket hauls taken on the ground in official international Test matches, One Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals. The first five-wicket haul taken in an international match on the ground was taken by England bowler Trevor Bailey who took five wickets for the cost of 20 runs (5/20) against South Africa in the ground's first Test match in 1956.First Test match, England v South Africa 1956\u201357, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1958.
