    "text": "The Ch\u00e2teau de Petit-Bois is a 19th-century mansion in Cosne-d'Allier in the Allier d\u00e9partment in the Auvergne region of France. The ch\u00e2teau was noted for the design of the park, which by the use of an artificial channel and a screen of trees, gave it the appearance of standing on an island. Its former grounds have been destroyed, however. *Summed up and translated from the equivalent article at French Wikip\u00e9dia, 6 November 2007 Category:Houses completed in the 19th century Category:Ch\u00e2teaux in Allier ",
