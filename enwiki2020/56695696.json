    "text": "The Stearns Golf Course, at 131 Clubhouse Dr. in Stearns, Kentucky, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. The nomination included including the golf course, a log clubhouse built in 1936, and a kidney-shaped in-ground pool. The clubhouse and pool were funded by the Works Progress Administration. It was located in a coal company town and the NRHP nomination described it as \"'a very unusual place, as well as a significant one. It shows the lengths that some coal companies went to create a familiar experience in a very foreign place, importing a feature of urban leisure in a place of rural work.'\" ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Kentucky Category:McCreary County, Kentucky ",
