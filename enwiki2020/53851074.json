    "text": "Atari 2600 four-switch \"wood veneer\" model The best-selling video game of all- time on the Atari 2600 console is Pac-Man, a port of the arcade game of the same name programmed by Tod Frye. Originally created by Toru Iwatani and released in 1980, Pac-Man was later ported to many home video game consoles, beginning with the Atari 2600 in 1982. Within months it became the best- selling home video game of all-time, with more than 1.5 million units pre- ordered by customers before its release. Pac-Man went on to sell over 7.7 million units worldwide. The second best-selling Atari 2600 game is Pitfall!, designed by David Crane for Activision, which has sold over 4 million units. Of the top 22 best-selling Atari 2600 video games, ten were developed and/or published by the console's manufacturer, Atari, Inc. Other publishers with multiple entries in the top 20 are Activision (six titles), Imagic (three titles) and Parker Brothers (two titles). Three of the games in the top 20 were programmed by David Crane, three by Howard Scott Warshaw, three by Rob Fulop, and two by Bradley G. Stewart. The Atari 2600 port of Space Invaders, programmed by Rick Maurer for Taito, was the first video game to sell a million copies, while the console port of Asteroids was the best-selling video game prior to the release of Pac-Man. ==Video games== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |+ List of best-selling video games on the Atari 2600 !scope=\"col\"|Title !scope=\"col\"|Developer(s) !scope=\"col\"|Publisher(s) !scope=\"col\"|Programmer(s) !scope=\"col\"|Release date !scope=\"col\"|Sales !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref. |- |Pac-Man |Atari, Inc. |Atari, Inc. |Tod Frye | | |align=\"center\"| |- |Pitfall! |Activision |Activision |David Crane | | |align=\"center\"| |- |Asteroids |Atari, Inc. |Atari, Inc. |Bradley G.
