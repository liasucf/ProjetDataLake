He is known for his villainous roles. == Career == Ram started his acting career with the television series Ethanai Manithargal that aired on Doordarshan as a thug. He made his film debut with Mudhalvan (1999), where he played a sub-inspector of police. The film, however, failed to provide the actor a major break. Ram survived a head injury while shooting for Dheena (2001). After Dheena, he starred in several films as a thug. About twenty years later, Ram landed in a meaty role in Thimiru Pudichavan (2018). Post Thimiru Pudichavan, he garnered acclaim for his performance as an aghori in Kanchana 3. Ram signed Thatrom Thookrom, where he essays the main antagonist. == Filmography == ; Films * Mudhalvan (1999) * Vallarasu (2000) * Pennin Manathai Thottu (2000) * Dheena (2001) * Thavasi (2001) * Kalatpadai (2003) * Anjaneya (2003) * Jana (2004) * Vasool Raja MBBS (2004) * Aathi (2006) * Aalwar (2007) * Pokkiri (2007) * Dhandayuthapani (2007) * Piragu (2007) * Kelvikuri (2007) * Rameswaram (2007) * Pattaya Kelappu (2008) * Karthik Anitha (2009) * Kadhal Kadhai (2009) * Janakan (2010; Malayalam) * Madrasapattinam (2010) * 365 Kadhal Kadithangal (2010) * Agam Puram (2010) * Sevenes (2011; Malayalam) * Velayudham (2011) * Sattam Oru Iruttarai (2012) * Kalla Thuppakki (2013) * Isaac Newton S/O Philipose (2013; Malayalam) * Goli Soda (2014) *Vallinam (2014) * Gajakesari (2014; Kannada) * Athithi (2014) * Jaihind 2 (2014) * Ponge Ezhu Manohara (2014) * Yennai Arindhaal (2015) * Kaaki Sattai (2015) * Maari (2015) * Adhibar (2015) * Puli (2015) * Octopus (2015; Kannada) * Manjal (2016) * Arthanari (2016) * Kabali (2016) * Tamilselvanum Thaniyar Anjalum (2016) * Spyder (2017; also in Telugu) * Theru Naaigal (2017) * Nimir (2018) * Chanakya Thanthram (2018; Malayalam) * Thimiru Pudichavan (2018) * Viswasam (2019) * Boomerang (2019) * Kanchana 3 (2019) * 100 (2019) * Kolaigaran (2019) * Ettuthikkum Para (2020) * Asuraguru (2020) * Kaadan (TBA) * Thatrom Thookrom (TBA) * Madai Thiranthu (TBA) ; Television *Ethanai Manithargal (Doordarshan) == References == == External links == * Category:Tamil male actors Category:Indian male film actors Category:20th- century Indian male actors Category:21st-century Indian male actors Category:Male actors in Malayalam cinema Category:Male actors in Kannada cinema Category:Male actors in Tamil cinema Category:Male actors in Telugu cinema Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
