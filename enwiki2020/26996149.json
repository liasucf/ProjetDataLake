    "text": "London Rockin' Rollers (LRR) is a WFTDA aligned flat-track roller derby league based in London, England. Founded in 2007, the league is a member of both the United Kingdom Roller Derby Association (UKRDA) and the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA), and plays by WFTDA rules. ==History== The league was started in 2007. At the time, there were only two other roller derby teams in the UK, the London Rollergirls and the Birmingham Blitz Dames. Later that year the team participated in the UK's first ever interleague scrimmage with Birmingham on 1 July. They made history again in 2007 when they played the Stuttgart Valley Roller Girlz in Europe's first interleague bout on 14 October. In 2009, the league presented their first home bouting season at the historic York Hall in Bethnal Green. The league also hosted its very first intraleague bout on 27 February 2010, a closely fought bout between the Voodoo Skull Krushers and the NeanderDolls Four league members were involved in the 2011 Roller Derby World Cup: Jack Attack and then-member The Mighty Mighty Bash representing Team England (3rd place), Kit Kat Power representing Team Sweden (6th place) and Dr D Zaster, the league's then head referee as a referee. In January 2012, London Rockin' Rollers competed in, and won, the UKRDA's Tattoo Freeze Tournament. In June, several of LRR were part of the Olympic Games opening ceremony and the Paralympic Games opening ceremony. In September, Kit Kat Power represented Team Sweden against Team USA and Jack Attack represented Team England, also against Team USA. In October 2012, the league was accepted as a member of the Women's Flat Track Derby Association Apprentice Programme,\"22 Leagues Join WFTDA Apprentice Program \", WFTDA, 18 October 2012 and it became a full member of the WFTDA in September 2013. ==Teams== The London Rockin' Rollers founded three new home teams late in 2009, the NeanderDolls, Voodoo Skull Krushers now known as VSK, and the Goldie Lookin' Chain Gang, known as Goldies. Members from the home teams compete against other leagues on either of the league's travel teams; the London Rockin' Rollers Allstars, and the London Rockin' Rollers Rising Stars who became known as London Rockin' Rollers Badasses. The Rising Stars, who are the 'B' travel team, were formed in late 2010 and have already competed in international bouts against Kallio Rolling Rainbow in Helsinki, Finland, and Crime City Rollers in Malm\u00f6, Sweden. They are now known as the London Rockin' Rollers Badasses. ==WFTDA rankings== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Season !Final ranking\"Current Rankings\", WFTDA !Playoffs !Championship |- |2014 |201 WFTDA |DNQ |DNQ |- |2015 |217 WFTDA |DNQ |DNQ |- |2016 |250 WFTDA |DNQ |DNQ |} ==Competitive History== ===2014=== ===2013=== Home :23 March London Rockin' Rollers 252 : 104 Hot Wheel Roller Derby :11 May London Rockin' Rollers 196 : 135 Hellfire Harlots :22 June London Rockin' Rollers 150 : 149 Paris Rollergirls :29 June London Rockin' Rollers (B) 166 : 155 Hells Belles Roller Derby :6 July London Rockin' Rollers 120 : 145 Copenhagen Roller Derby :4 September London Rockin' Rollers 119 : 205 Gent Go Go Rollergirls :13 October London Rockin' Rollers (B) 111 : 208 Mean Valley Roller Girls :26 October London Rockin' Rollers 41 : 769 Southern Discomfort Roller Derby :14 December London Rockin' Rollers (B) 87 : 237 Malmo Crime City Rollers B :14 December London Rockin' Rollers 144 : 283 Malmo Crime City Rollers Away :9 March London Rockin Rollers 210 : 237 Brighton Rockers Roller Derby :6 June London Rockin' Rollers 62 : 255 Stockholm Roller Derby :3 August London Rockin' Rollers 255 : 76 Birmingham Blitz Dames (Feel Good Hits Of The Summer) :3 August London Rockin' Rollers 121 : 190 Middlesbrough Milk Rollers (Feel Good Hits Of The Summer) ===2012=== Home :9 June London Rockin' Rollers 244: 209 Dublin Rollergirls :20 October London Rockin' Rollers 100: 172 Stockholm Roller Derby :15 December GLCG 83: 98 VSK :15 December VSK 46: 85 Neanderdolls :15 December Neanderdolls 128: 84 GLCG :15 December VSK 84: 71 Neanderdolls Away :15 January London Rockin' Rollers 122 : 44 Lincolnshire Bombers Roller Girls (Tattoo Freeze) :15 January London Rockin' Rollers 78 : 61 Auld Reekie Roller Girls (Tattoo Freeze) :15 January London Rockin' Rollers 105: 23 Central City Rollergirls (Tattoo Freeze) :18 February London Rockin' Rollers (B) 123: 165 Dolly Rockit Rollers :31 March London Rockin' Rollers (B) 84: 254 Tiger Bay Brawlers :19 May London Rockin' Rollers 109: 223 Central City Rollergirls :16 June London Rockin' Rollers 119: 91 Leeds Roller Dolls :19 August London Rockin' Rollers 145: 122 Big Bucks High Rollers :25 August London Rockin' Rollers 114: 168 Glasgow Roller Derby (Chaos On The Clyde) :25 August London Rockin' Rollers 152: 107 Stuttgart Valley Rollergirlz (Chaos On The Clyde) :26 August London Rockin' Rollers 92: 173 Auld Reekie Roller Girls (Chaos On The Clyde) ===2011=== Home :5 February Goldie Lookin' Chain Gang 98 : 109 Voodoo Skull Krushers (2010 Final) :19 March London Rockin' Rollers 172 : 31 Leeds Roller Dolls :19 March London Rockin' Rollers (B) 112 : 73 Tiger Bay Brawlers :1 May London Rockin' Rollers 101 : 123 Central City Rollergirls :1 May Neanderdolls 86 : 73 VSK :2 July London Rockin' Rollers (B) 170 : 44 Bedfordshire Roller Girls :2 July GLCG 117 : 92 Neanderdolls :3 September London Rockin' Rollers 149 : 110 Auld Reekie Roller Girls [Twisted Thistles] :3 September London Rockin' Rollers (B) 124 : 126 Auld Reekie Roller Girls [Cannon Belles] :16 October London Rockin' Rollers (A) 212 : 115 Stuttgart Valley Rollergirlz :16 October Voodoo Skull Krushers 178 : 118 Goldie Lookin' Chain Gang :10 December London Rockin' Rollers 218 : 102 Southern Discomfort Roller Derby Away :15 January London Rockin' Rollers 117: 63 Auld Reekie Roller Girls (Tattoo Freeze) :15 January London Rockin' Rollers 76 : 96 London Rollergirls (B) (Tattoo Freeze) :16 January London Rockin' Rollers 116 : 55 Central City Rollergirls (Tattoo Freeze) :14 May Central City Rollergirls 99 : 90 London Rockin' Rollers :23 July Crime City Rollers 300 : 43 London Rockin' Rollers (B) :19 November Berlin Bombshells (B) 150 : 149 London Rockin Rollers (B) :19 November Berlin Bombshells (A) 187 : 195 London Rockin' Rollers (A) ===2010=== Home :27 February NeanderDolls 95 : 98 VSK :15 May London Rockin' Rollers: 105 : 88 Rainy City Roller Girls [Manchester Motley Crew] :21 August VSK 118 :120 Goldie Lookin' Chain Gang :14 November Neanderdolls 65: 109 GLCG Away :13 February Glasgow Roller Girls [Irn Bruisers] 116 : 102 London Rockin' Rollers :19 June Leeds Roller Dolls [Rotten Rollers] 94 : 116 London Rockin' Rollers :7 August Auld Reekie Roller Girls 93: 117 London Rockin' Rollers :16 October Stuttgart Valley Roller Girlz 85 : 116 London Rockin' Rollers :30 October Royal Windsor Roller Girls 72 : 158 London Rockin' Rollers :4 December Kallio Rolling Rainbow 64 : 192 London Rockin' Rollers -
