Originally the race was held in early March and consisted of five stages. However, due to Spain's financial turmoil, the race was scaled back to three stages in 2011 and two stages in 2012. From 2013 to 2018 the Vuelta a Murcia was organised as a single-day race and shifted to mid-February on the international calendar. In 2019 the race was expanded to two stages.Vuelta Ciclista a la Region de Murcia (2.1) on BikeRaceInfo. It is part of the UCI Europe Tour as a 2.1 event. ==Controversies== All Italian teams were banned from taking part in 2010 edition of the race by the race organizers. This decision was made due to the banning of Spanish cyclist Alejandro Valverde by the Italian Olympic Committee due to his links with the Operaci\u00f3n Puerto blood doping ring. In 2011 Alberto Contador won both the overall and points classification after winning Stage 2 and the Stage 3 individual time trial. However, in February 2012 he was suspended and all his results after July 2010 were voided, awarding J\u00e9r\u00f4me Coppel of Saur Sojasun the overall victory. ==Past winners \u2013 men's race== ==Past winners \u2013 women's race== ==References== ==External links== * Murcia Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1981 Category:1981 establishments in Spain Category:Sport in the Region of Murcia Category:UCI Europe Tour races ",
