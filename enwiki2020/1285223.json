His work Brahma Sutras is variously dated from 500 BCE to 450 CE. The Brahma Sutras of B\u0101dar\u0101yana, also called the Vedanta Sutra, were compiled in its present form around 400\u2013450 CE, but \"the great part of the Sutra must have been in existence much earlier than that\". Estimates of the date of B\u0101dar\u0101yana's lifetime differ between 200 BCE and 200 CE. Badarayana is regarded as having written the basic text of the Vedanta system, the Ved\u0101ntas\u016btra a.k.a. Brahmas\u016btra. He is thus considered the founder of the Ved\u0101nta system of philosophy. ==References== ==Sources== * * * Category:Vedanta Category:Hindu philosophers Category:Ancient Indian philosophers ",
