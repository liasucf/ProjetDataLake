The team had only ever made the final once before back in 2006, but lost the final, in extra-time, to Warwickshire. On the way to the title they beat Yorkshire and Kilkenny before beating Warwickshire in the final to a scoreline of 3-10 to 2-07. This set up an All-Ireland Junior Semi- final with Cavan. However they were defeated on the day to a scoreline of 1-17 to 0-06. Most recently the Scotland Men won the All-Britain title in 2019 against a tough Warwickshire team. They went on to contest the All-Ireland Quarter Final versus Kerry. 2015 became a momentous year for the Scotland ladies team as they reached the All-Ireland Junior Final to be played at Croke Park. They beat Derry with a score line of 1-13 to 2-05 at Fingallians GAA ground. They played a tough game against Louth at Croke Park on 27 September 2015. The ==Hurling== In 1905, Lancashire and Glasgow entered the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship at the quarter-final stage. Lancashire returned for one more championship campaign in 1913, whilst Glasgow returned for the 1910 and 1913 championships. In 2019, Ceann Creige Hurling and Camogie Club was formed and they have teams of all ages in hurling and camogie, ranging from minor to senior level. ==References== GAA Category:Gaelic games governing bodies in the United Kingdom Category:Sport in Scotland ",
