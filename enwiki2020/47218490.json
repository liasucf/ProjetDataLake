As part of the coaching set-up Rob Moffat joined him as assistant coach. During Dixon's tenure Glasgow Caledonians dropped its merged identity and rebranded itself back to Glasgow Rugby in 2002. Dixon was replaced as Warriors boss by New Zealander Kiwi Searancke on 27 June 2002. when he became the SRU's Head of Coach Development. He was to retain some input to the Warriors as he was to become official team manager offering advice to his successor. Glasgow's assistant Rob Moffat was to become Head Coach of the newly reformed Border Reivers. Searancke's reign at Glasgow was short-lived as it was felt he was overly critical of the players. This meant Dixon had to step in as caretaker in April 2003 when the New Zealander left the club. The caretaker role only lasted a few weeks as the club quickly settled on Hugh Campbell as the new Glasgow Head Coach. === Border Reivers === As well as Head of Coach Development, Dixon was made Assistant Coach at Border Reivers in 2006. However, financial troubles caused the Borders club to fold in 2007. === SRU === Dixon held the SRU's coaching development role until 2009 when he fell victim to cost cutting. === Georgia === In 2010 he was to become the national coach of the Georgian rugby team and coached them at the World Cup. He was awarded the country's Honorary Order of Excellence by the President for services to rugby in Georgia. === World Rugby === In 2012 he became a project manager for World Rugby advising emergent countries. He has special remit for Georgia and Romania. ==Honours== ===As a coach=== * ' ** Five Nations Championship *** Runner-up: 1996 ** Centenary Quaich *** Winner: 1996, 1997 * Glasgow Warriors ** Scottish Inter-District Championship *** Winner: 1999-2000 ==References== ==External links== * Richie Dixon on Andy Nicol Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Glasgow Warriors coaches Category:Glasgow District players Category:Jordanhill RFC players Category:Barbarian F.C. players Category:Scottish rugby union players Category:Scottish rugby union coaches Category:Scotland national rugby union team coaches ",
