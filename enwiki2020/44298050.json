    "text": "Blacketts were a small department store chain based in the north east of England with its flagship store located in Sunderland. == History == Blackett & Sons was opened in Sunderland in 1826 by William Blackett, a draper. The business grew from a drapery to a full line department store based on the corner of Union & High Street. Stores were opened in Barnard Castle, Bishop Auckland and Stockton-on-Tees (1939), while they purchased the department store of D Hill, Carter & Company in Hartlepool during the Second World War. In 1963. the Blacketts group of stores was purchased by fellow department store group Hide & Co. In 1970, the Hartlepool store was closed, becoming a discount superstore before being converted into The Hill Carter hotel. The Stockton on Tee store was sold to Waring and Gillow, a furniture company. The main store in Sunderland closed in 1972 due to the competition of department stores in the town. == References == Category:Defunct department stores of the United Kingdom Category:Defunct retail companies of the United Kingdom Category:Retail companies established in 1826 Category:British companies established in 1826 Category:1826 establishments in England Category:1972 disestablishments in England Category:British companies disestablished in 1972 ",
