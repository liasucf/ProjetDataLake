    "text": "The Neuch\u00e2tel Crisis (1856-1857) was the result of a diplomatic question between the Swiss Confederation and the King of Prussia regarding the rights of the Royal House of Prussia to the Principality of Neuch\u00e2tel. The Principality of Neuch\u00e2tel was granted to the King of Prussia in 1707, then was ruled by Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte after Frederick William III of Prussia was deposed as Prince of Neuch\u00e2tel. In 1814, the Principality was again granted to Frederick William, and the following year he agreed to allow the Principality to join the Swiss Confederation (which was an alliance of semi-independent states rather than a single country) while remaining under his rule. The Principality successfully revolted against Prussian rule in 1848. In 1849, the Prussian government began to press for recognition of their right to Neuch\u00e2tel. Several states proposed that Neuch\u00e2tel be separated from but remain allied with the Swiss Confederation. The British government sought to establish a diplomatic agreement, with the support of the French. The King of Prussia continued to press for his rights on the matter. On September 2\u20133, 1856, there was a revolt by the Neuch\u00e2tel royalists, loyal to the prince, which brought the situation to a crisis point. The revolt failed and the royalists were made hostage. Negotiations began between France, the United Kingdom, Prussia and Russia for the future of Neuch\u00e2tel, with the United Kingdom strongly supporting the independence of the Principality. This conference took place in 1857. Prussia finally yielded its claim to Neuch\u00e2tel at the insistence of the other powers. ==References== Category:Canton of Neuch\u00e2tel Category:19th century in Switzerland ",
