    "text": "Language of Love () is a 1969 Swedish sex educational film directed by Torgny Wickman. It was an international success. It gained publicity when 30,000 people gathered on Trafalgar Square in London to protest against a nearby movie theatre showing it, one of the protesters being pop singer Cliff Richard. Lord Longford and Raymond Blackburn decided to pursue a matter of pornography classification for the film Language of Love into the Court of Appeal and lost the writ of mandamus against the Police Commissioner, who had refused to intrude upon the British Board of Film Classification remit.Reported as [1973] 1 Q.B. 241 (C.A.) United States customs were known to have confiscated copies of the film. Following such events, it was marketed as a sexploitation film of the \"white coater\" variety in some places \u2014 a pornographic film masquerading as a documentary or scientific film. The film had two sequels, Mera ur k\u00e4rlekens spr\u00e5k in 1970 and K\u00e4rlekens XYZ in 1971. In 1973 the three films were edited together into a new film, Det b\u00e4sta ur K\u00e4rlekens spr\u00e5k-filmerna (\"The Best from the Language of Love Films\"). Mera ur k\u00e4rlekens spr\u00e5k (More from the Language of Love) had equally successful box office though it dealt more with alternate sexuality and lifestyles and also with the disabled. Remakes of the first two films appeared in 2004 (K\u00e4rlekens spr\u00e5k a.k.a. K\u00e4rlekens spr\u00e5k 2000) and in 2009 (Mera ur k\u00e4rlekens spr\u00e5k), both directed by Anders Lennberg. The film included split screen visions of couples having sex with Ravel's Bolero playing in the background. ==Cast== * Inge Hegeler * Sten Hegeler * Maj-Briht Bergstr\u00f6m-Walan * Sture Cullhed * Barbro Hiort af Orn\u00e4s * Stig Johanson * G\u00f6the Grefbo * G\u00f6sta Krantz * Julie Bernby * B\u00f6rje Nyberg * Lennart Lindberg * Margaretha Henriksson * Conny Ling ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:Swedish films Category:Swedish documentary films Category:1969 films Category:Sexuality in Sweden Category:Sexploitation films Category:Swedish-language films Category:1960s documentary films Category:Documentary films about sexuality Category:Sexual revolution ",
