    "text": "right Adam Piero\u0144czyk (born 24 January 1970) is a Polish jazz saxophonist and composer. He plays tenor and soprano saxophones, as well as the zoucra. ==Early life== Piero\u0144czyk was born in Elblag, Poland, on 24 January 1970. He learned the piano for three years from the age of eight, and later switched to saxophone. After moving with his parents to Germany, he \"enrolled in the jazz department at the Higher Music School\". ==Later life and career== Piero\u0144czyk has won awards from the Polish magazine Jazz Forum: New Hope of Polish Jazz in 1997, and the readers' choice as Best Soprano Saxophonist in 2003 and 2004. His tribute to Krzysztof Komeda, Komeda: The Innocent Sorcerer, was released in 2010. His Adam Piero\u0144czyk Quartet, from around the same time, was based on saxophone and trombone, without chordal instruments. ==Playing style== The Jazz Book describes Piero\u0144czyk as an \"emotionally enormously powerful stylist [...] whose playing is deeply founded in the great black tenor [saxophone] tradition\". His playing on Adam Piero\u0144czyk Quartet was described by a New York City Jazz Record reviewer as: \"folk-futurist along the lines of Ornette Coleman, [...with] nursery-rhyme melodies that seem to change key every few bars, stringing together fragmented phrases\". ==Discography== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
