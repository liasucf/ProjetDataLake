    "text": "Thomas Latter (1816 \u2013 8 December 1853) was a military officer of the Bengal Army and a scholar of the Burmese language. ==Biography== Latter was born in India in 1816, the son of Major Barr\u00e9 Latter, an officer who distinguished himself in the Anglo\u2013Nepalese War. He obtained a commission in 1836 from the East India Company in the 67th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry, then stationed in Arakan. There he devoted his leisuretime to the study of the Burmese language, and in 1845 he published a Burmese grammar. Although subsequent to the primers of Adoniram Judson, the American missionary, his work was the first scholarly treatise on the subject. At the commencement of the negotiations respecting breaches of the 1826 Treaty of Yandabo, Latter left his regiment to serve as chief interpreter to Commodore George Lambert's expedition, and on the outbreak of the Second Burmese War he served Sir Henry Thomas Godwin in the same capacity. On 14 April 1852 he led the storming party despatched by Godwin against the eastern entrance of the Shwedagon Pagoda. He acted so gallantly that W. F. B. Laurie, the historian of the war, called him the \"Chevalier Bayard of the expedition.\" He took part in the capture of Pegu in June 1852. When shortly afterwards the town of Prome, which was one of the chief rallying-places of the enemy, was occupied, Latter was appointed resident deputy commissioner on 30 December 1852. The post was rendered a particularly difficult one by the fact that, although open warfare had ceased, the Burmese were still avowedly hostile to British influence\u2014an anomalous state of things which lasted until the definitive treaty of 1862. The vigilance and activity which Latter exhibited in repressing disaffection in the area of Prome during the following year rendered him specially obnoxious to the Burmese monarchy, and at 2:00 A.M. on the morning of 8 December 1853 he was murdered in his bed. He was buried at Prome with military honours on the following day. ==References== ==Works cited== * Category:1816 births Category:1853 deaths Category:British Army personnel of the Second Anglo- Burmese War Category:British East India Company Army officers Category:Linguists from the United Kingdom Category:English people murdered abroad Category:People murdered in Myanmar Category:Murdered military personnel ",
