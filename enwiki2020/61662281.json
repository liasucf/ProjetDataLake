    "text": "The 2019 CONMEBOL South American Beach Soccer League is the third edition of the South American Beach Soccer League (named natively in Spanish as the CONMEBOL Liga Sudamericana de F\u00fatbol Playa), a continental league competition for South American men's national beach soccer teams. Organised by the governing body for South American football, CONMEBOL, as part of its Development Department's Evolution Program, all ten members of the continental confederation take part, with both senior and under 20s national teams participating in the league events. The teams are first divided into two geographically based zones (North and South) to compete in a round robin tournament against other members of their own zone during the regular season; the points earned by both the senior and under 20s teams are combined. This season, the make-up of the zones was changed for the first time. The winners of each zone then proceeded to face each other in the finals to contest the title. Brazil are the defending champions. ==Format== The league operates under the same format established for the inaugural season. ==Calendar== The calendar was revealed on 7 August. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !width=80|Phase !width=\"220\"| Dates !width=\"130\"| Country !width=\"130\"| City !width=\"130\"| Event !colspan=2 width=50|Zone |- | style=\"border-bottom: 2px solid grey\" rowspan=2 align=center |Regular season|| 4\u20138 September 2019 || || Rosario || South zone || || bgcolor=#b4dced align=center width=25|S |-style=\"border-bottom: 2px solid grey\" | 1\u20135 October 2019 || || Manta || North zone ||bgcolor=#ffdd96 align=center width=25|N|| |- | align=center|Finals || TBA 2020 || TBA || TBA || Finals ||bgcolor=#ffdd96 align=center|N||bgcolor=#b4dced align=center|S |} ==Teams== Zone composition of the 2019 SABSL The ten member nations of CONMEBOL enter two teams each: their respective senior and under 20s national teams. In total, 20 teams will compete. For this season, CONMEBOL have altered the existing composition of the two zones, deciding that Brazil and Peru of the north zone and Paraguay and Uruguay of the south zone, will swap conferences. (This effectively makes Paraguay and Uruguay exclaves of the north zone as they are only bordered by nations of the south). The numbers in parentheses show the South American ranking of each team prior to the start of the season (rankings only apply to the senior teams). ===North zone=== * (6th) * (5th) * (2nd) * (3rd) * (9th) * * * * * ===South zone=== * (4th) * (1st) * (10th) * (8th) * (7th) * * * * * ==South zone== The Paran\u00e1 River at Caribe Canalla The South zone regular season took place in the Argentinian city of Rosario.
