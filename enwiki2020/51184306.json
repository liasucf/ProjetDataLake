    "text": "Voxpro is a large corporate multinational provider of outsourced multilingual customer service and technical support services for international brands. It is the largest in its industry in Ireland or the UK. ==History== Voxpro was founded in 1999 by husband and wife team Dan and Linda Kiely. Since its inception its headquarters have been in Cork, Ireland, over a Marlboro Street public house. It also has offices in Dublin, Sacramento, San Francisco and Bucharest. The initial team was six people but employment expansion occurred fast. It focuses on customer service \u2013 but for companies that fit with its vision. ==Notable clients== Today Voxpro's clients include: Airbnb, Google, Nestlabs. ==Further development== Voxpro more than trebled its US workforce after announcing 450 positions at its base in California. According to Jon Ward, General Manager of Voxpro US, \u201cVoxpro\u2019s North American expansion is in full swing with the imminent announcement of another new site. Our announcement today of 450 additional roles in Folsom will ensure sufficient highly trained individuals are in position for our continued expansion. We are also looking to the east coast where we will open a sales and marketing office in New York later this year, together with an east coast centre of excellence.\u201d The firm\u2019s plans comprise a \u2018futuristic call centre with 750 jobs, and a lot of open space, mirroring Google\u2019s design. In terms of its likeness to Google, Voxpro\u2019s Managing Director Aidan O\u2019Shea claimed that it is \u201csimilar, but different.\u201d O\u2019Shea believes the firm has a very clear picture on its targeted industries in the future. The firm has no intention for example, on focusing on banks, utility or telecommunications companies. Rather, it is looking into the financial services industry. He also claims that it is a place young people want to work at and has a very different feel to other standard outsourcing firms. As such Voxpro looks for a certain type of employee. CEO Kiely said that an initial public offering will be a viable option once revenue hits around \u20ac100m. ==Awards and acclaim== According to an article in Biz Journals, \u201cVoxpro has made waves in Europe with an approach to business that focuses on mirroring the culture of its clients within its service centers, and this approach is readily apparent upon entering the new office.\u201d In 2013, Voxpro won the High Growth Company award at the it@Cork Leaders Awards. In 2014, the Cork Chamber/ Vodafone Company of the Year award, as well as the 2013/2014 Deloitte Best Managed Companies Award. Both Kielys were named MSL Cork Business People of the Year in October 2013 and in the same year, Linda won the Entrepreneur of the Year at the IMAGE Businesswoman of the Year awards 2013. In 2015, Voxpro received the Grand Prix Award at the eir Elevation Fast Company Awards 2015, for \u201cingenuity and economic growth potential of businesses across Ireland. In 2016 Voxpro was named as one of Ireland\u2019s \u2018Best Managed\u2019 companies in the Deloitte Best Managed Companies Awards Programme. This award recognizes indigenous firms in Ireland \u201coperating at the highest levels of business performance.\u201d ==References== Category:Information technology consulting firms of Ireland Category:Customer communications management Category:Technology companies established in 1999 Category:1999 establishments in Ireland ",
