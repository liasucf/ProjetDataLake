    "text": "Megan Martha White (born December 10, 1974) is an American former musician and singer best known for her work as the drummer of Detroit rock duo the White Stripes. Her music career began when, on a whim, she played on her future White Stripes bandmate Jack White's drums in 1997. Inspired by her minimalist and untrained drumming style, he decided to form a band with her and they began performing two months later. The band quickly became a Detroit underground favorite before achieving international fame. White has been nominated for various awards as a part of the White Stripes, receiving four Grammy Awards. White's drumming style has been called \"primal\" for its simplicity, and has drawn both praise and criticism. Her musical influences are wide and varied, with Bob Dylan being her favorite artist. She calls herself \"very shy\" and is known for keeping an extremely low public profile, also inspired by Dylan. She and Jack publicly portrayed themselves as siblings, but public records emerged in 2001 that showed they were not related; in fact, they had married in 1996 and divorced in 2000, before the White Stripes became popular. In 2009, she married guitarist Jackson Smith, the son of musicians Patti Smith and Fred \"Sonic\" Smith. They divorced in 2013. While on tour in support of the White Stripes' 2007 album Icky Thump, White suffered a bout of acute anxiety and the remaining dates of the tour were cancelled. After a few public appearances and a hiatus from recording, the band announced in February 2011 that they would be disbanding. White has not been active in the music industry since. ==Early life== Megan Martha White was born in the affluent Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan, on December 10, 1974, the daughter of Catherine and Walter Hackett White Jr. She has an older sister, Heather.\"Meg White Biography\".

She attended Grosse Pointe North High School and, according to one classmate, was \"always the quiet, obviously artistic type, and she just kept very much to herself\". While still in high school, she decided not to go to college and instead pursue a career as a chef. She began to work at Memphis Smoke, a restaurant in downtown Royal Oak, where that she first met budding musician Jack White, a fellow high school senior from a Detroit neighborhood known as Mexicantown, and they frequented the coffee shops, local music venues, and record stores of the area. They began dating and were eventually married on September 21, 1996.
