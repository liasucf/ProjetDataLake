    "text": "The men's 82.5 kg weightlifting competitions at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London took place on 11 August at the Empress Hall of the Earls Court Exhibition Centre.Official Report, p. 476. It was the sixth time the light- heavyweight class competition was held, all at 82.5 kg. Each weightlifter had three attempts at each of the three lifts. The best score for each lift was summed to give a total. The weightlifter could increase the weight between attempts (minimum of 5 kg between first and second attempts, 2.5 kg between second and third attempts) but could not decrease weight. If two or more weightlifters finished with the same total, the competitors' body weights were used as the tie-breaker (lighter athlete wins).Official Report, p. 481. ==Records== Prior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows. {| class=\"wikitable\" |rowspan=4|World record | Press | | 141.5 kg | | 1947 |- | Snatch | | 131.5 kg | | 1947 |- | Clean & Jerk | | 169 kg | | 1945 |- | Total | | 425 kg | Paris, France | 18\u201319 October 1946 |- |rowspan=5|Olympic record | Press | | 110 kg | Berlin, Germany | 3 August 1936 |- | Snatch | | 117.5 kg | Berlin, Germany | 3 August 1936 |- |rowspan=2| Clean & Jerk | | 150 kg | Berlin, Germany | 3 August 1936 |- | | 150 kg | Berlin, Germany | 3 August 1936 |- | Total | | 372.5 kg | Berlin, Germany | 3 August 1936 |} ==Results== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" !rowspan=2 | Rank !rowspan=2 | Athlete !rowspan=2 | Nation !rowspan=2 | Body weight !colspan=4 | Press (kg) !colspan=4 | Snatch (kg) !colspan=4 | Clean & Jerk (kg) !rowspan=2 | Total |- !1 !2 !3 !Result !1 !2 !3 !Result !1 !2 !3 !Result |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 80.66 || 122.5 || 127.5 || 130 || 130 || 122.5 || 130 || ~~132.5~~ || 130 || 157.5 || ~~165~~ || ~~165~~ || 157.5 || 417.5 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 80.85 || 105 || ~~110~~ || 110 || 110 || 112.5 || ~~117.5~~ || 117.5 || 117.5 || 142.5 || 150 || 152.5 || 152.5 || 380 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 82.49 || 105 || 110 || ~~112.5~~ || 110 || 115 || ~~120~~ || 120 || 120 || 145 || ~~150~~ || ~~150~~ || 145 || 375 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 82.20 || 100 || 105 || 107.5 || 107.5 || 107.5 || 112.5 || ~~115~~ || 112.5 || 142.5 || 147.5 || 150 || 150 || 370 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 81.42 || 100 || 105 || ~~107.5~~ || 105 || 105 || 110 || 115 || 115 || 135 || 142.5 || 147.5 || 147.5 || 367.5 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 80.84 || 105 || 110 || 112.5 || 112.5 || 105 || 110 || 112.5 || 112.5 || 135 || 140 || ~~145~~ || 140 || 365 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 80.98 || 95 || 100 || ~~102.5~~ || 100 || 110 || 115 || ~~117.5~~ || 115 || 140 || ~~145~~ || ~~145~~ || 140 || 355 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 81.15 || 102.5 || 107.5 || 110 || 110 || 100 || 105 || 110 || 110 || 130 || 135 || ~~140~~ || 135 || 355 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 82.24 || 105 || 110 || ~~115~~ || 110 || 105 || ~~110~~ || ~~110~~ || 105 || 135 || ~~140~~ || 140 || 140 || 355 |- | 10 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 82.40 || 95 || 100 || 102.5 || 102.5 || 105 || 110 || 112.5 || 112.5 || 135 || 140 || ~~142.5~~ || 140 || 355 |- | 11 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 82.50 || 97.5 || ~~102.5~~ || ~~102.5~~ || 97.5 || 107.5 || ~~112.5~~ || 112.5 || 112.5 || 140 || ~~150~~ || ~~150~~ || 140 || 350 |- | 11 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 82.50 || 97.5 || 102.5 || ~~105~~ || 102.5 || 100 || 105 || 107.5 || 107.5 || 132.5 || 137.5 || 140 || 140 || 350 |- | 13 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 79.92 || 90 || ~~95~~ || 95 || 95 || 102.5 || ~~107.5~~ || 107.5 || 107.5 || 137.5 || ~~145~~ || 145 || 145 || 347.5 |- | 14 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 82.09 || 95 || ~~100~~ || 100 || 100 || 107.5 || ~~112.5~~ || ~~112.5~~ || 107.5 || 135 || ~~140~~ || ~~140~~ || 135 || 342.5 |- | 15 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 80.75 || ~~97.5~~ || 97.5 || ~~102.5~~ || 97.5 || 97.5 || ~~102.5~~ || 102.5 || 102.5 || 127.5 || 132.5 || ~~135~~ || 132.5 || 332.5 |- | 16 ||align=left|Lee Yeong-hwan ||align=left| || 81.39 || 100 || ~~105~~ || ~~105~~ || 100 || ~~105~~ || 105 || ~~110~~ || 105 || ~~145~~ || ~~145~~ || ~~145~~ || 0 || 205 |} ==New records== {|class = \"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- | Press |130 kg |align=left| | |- | Snatch |130 kg |align=left| | |- |Clean & Jerk |157.5 kg |align=left| | |- |Total |417.5 kg |align=left| | |} ==References== Category:Weightlifting at the 1948 Summer Olympics ",
