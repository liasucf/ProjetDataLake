He began his studies on art during childhood with lessons held by Master Eugenio Da Venezia, starting around a post-impressionistic figurative way of expression generated by a group of modern artists working before and world war II in Italy. He studied art history and business administration at university, but he doesn't like to write these qualifications with the dr abbreviation or similar (doctor, phd, dottore, ext). More research, to deepen his education on contemporary art, has been done in cities such as London, Paris, Madrid as well as Milan, Venice and Rome. In Venice he is one of the last artistic director to defend a nineteenth century masters group characterized by exploring nature, still life and portraits (Marco Novati, Eugenio Da Venezia, Neno Mori, Carlo Dalla Zorza, Fioravante Seibezzi, Cosimo Privato, Mario Varagnolo for example). In this context the art monographs \u201cGigi Candiani Tessere di vita\u201d,Publication details: A. Chivil\u00f2 \"Gigi Candiani Tessere di vita\" Alcione editore, 2013. \u201cMarco Novati Volti Vissuti\u201dPublication details: A. Chivil\u00f2 \"Marco Novati Volti Vissuti\". A.

Moro Editore, 2016. triggered in Italy a debate about the importance of these figurative artists in modern Italian art. Source details: Gigi Candiani book presentation. Ateneo Veneto Venice 10/23/2014 As freelance writer he is collaborating with magazines as Art Review, Drawing, Art Style, Art Calling, Art&trA.; During his career Chivil\u00f2 interviewed artists as for example Sir Anthony Caro, Marc Quinn, Shozo Shimamoto, Hermann Nitsch, Jacques Villegl\u00e9, Fabrizio Plessi, Gianni Berengo Gardin, Riccardo Licata, Eugenio Carmi, Rabarama, Achille Perilli, Luca Alinari, Alberto Biasi, Xu Deqi, Helidon Xhixha. On June 2017 all these art contacts, that involved him, have been published in a new book: \"Tracce Segni Macchie Bruciature Concetti Scatti Tagli Buchi\".Publication details: A. Chivil\u00f2 \"Tracce Segni Macchie Bruciature Concetti Scatti Tagli Buchi\" A. Moro Editore, 2017. As art critic a simplicity of expression (not banality) is a fundamental feature of his texts. Source details: Marco Novati book presentation, Caio Giulio Cesare hall Mestre 5/11/2015 As art curator fundamental are the collaboration with Italian critics, for example Giovanni Faccenda and Vittorio Sgarbi. He has also organised exhibitions at Villa Pisani, Stra (Venice), Casa dei Carraresi (Treviso) and in other different Italian locations as Milan and Rome. From 2013 to 2016 he studied and analyzed the ignorance and lack of communication in the Italian culture (different geographical areas). The project called Quod erat demonstrandum was a sort of global provocative act denouncing the current strength of commonplace generated by a culturally superficial society. Now he attempts to form the society towards a philosophy based on deepening and listening. == Publications == Recent edited anthologies include: Marco Novati Volti Vissuti 2015, Gigi Candiani Atmosfere Rarefatte 2016 and Tracce Segni Macchie Bruciature Concetti Scatti Tagli Buchi 2017.
