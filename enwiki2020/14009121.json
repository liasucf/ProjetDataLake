    "text": "Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life (2007) is a non-fiction book by Barbara Kingsolver detailing her family's attempt to eat only locally grown food for an entire year. ==Description== The book revolves around the concept of improving the family's diet by eating only foods that her family was able to grow themselves or obtain locally (save for grains and olive oil). Kingsolver, along with her husband and daughters, start a farm in Virginia where they grow and can different varieties of tomatoes, learn about rooster husbandry, make cheese, and adjust to eating foods only when they are locally in season. The book contrasts this with the ecological costs of growing food in factory farms, transporting it thousands of miles, and adding chemical preservatives so it will not spoil. An excerpt was published in the May/June 2007 issue of Mother Jones magazine, and is available online.Excerpt of Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life at motherjones.com There are also audio files of a May 16, 2007 discussion between Kingsolver and her husband at an hour-long presentation at a bookstore in Corte Madera, California. ==Critical reception== Time magazine's Lev Grossman named it one of the Top 10 Nonfiction Books of 2007, ranking it at #7.Grossman, Lev; Top 10 Nonfiction Books; time.com Rick Bass wrote in The Boston Globe that \"this text will fold quietly into the reader's consciousness, with affecting grace and dignity, because of its prose and sensibilities.\" and that \"Kingsolver is no pious soapboxer, but instead explores these ideas with enthusiasm and the awe of discovery.\" ==See also== * Locavore * Local food ==References== ==External links== *Animal, Vegetable, Miracle official website *Good Eatin' Barbara Kingsolver grows her own, the Boston Phoenix Category:American non-fiction books Category:2007 non-fiction books Category:Health and wellness books Category:Sustainability books Category:Organic food Category:Rural community development Category:Books by Barbara Kingsolver Category:Books about Appalachia Category:Books about food and drink Category:HarperCollins books ",
