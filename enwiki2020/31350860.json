As well, within the realm of major arts agencies, Louisville Chorus is only one year younger than the Louisville Orchestra. The Louisville Chorus has filmed concerts for international broadcast on EWTN, the largest religious media network in the world and has recorded music for Hollywood in the making of movies. The Louisville Chorus is also a member of Chorus America and has had music chosen for nationwide broadcast on the first nationally distributed radio series to focus exclusively on the art of choral music performance. A professional chorus of auditioned singers, Louisville Chorus thrills audiences with an immense repertoire ranging from choral masterworks with orchestra to pops, family-oriented, Broadway, and celebrations of Christmas, Valentine\u2019s Day, Fourth of July, and more. This chorus offers a very active season of concerts, multimedia events, and outreach programs. It performs with other arts agencies including adult and youth ensembles, and offers concerts for arts series and other events throughout Kentuckiana. The Kentucky Arts Council, the state arts agency, provides partial operating support to The Louisville Chorus with state tax dollars and federal funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. Louisville Chorus is supported by the Louisville Fund for the Arts. ==History== In 1939, Father Joseph Emrich founded The Holy Name Choral Club, which later became The Choral Club of Louisville in 1972 and Louisville Chorus in 1987. The late Joseph Herde succeeded Father Emrich. Richard Spalding, Conductor Emeritus, lovingly devoted 20 years to this choral arts agency and made possible its 1985 European Sister Cities Concert Tour. From 1991-2002, Music Director Daniel Spurlock ushered this high-calibre ensemble and its audiences into inspirational, poignant, and emotional musical experiences. In January, 2003, The Louisville Chorus was pleased to welcome the expertise of S. Timothy Glasscock as Artistic Director. Therese Davis, Executive Director and Pianist, has collaborated with the music directors since 1969 to ensure high standards and the successful growth and development of the Chorus. In June 2009 Daniel Spurlock returned as our dynamic Music Director of the Louisville Chorus. ===Highlights=== Ongoing Annual Events: MasterWorks with orchestra \u2022 Performance collaborations with other arts institutions, including the youth \u2022 Local and Outreach Concerts \u2022 Celebrations of Christmas, Valentine's Day, Fourth of July, and more \u2022 Active season of concerts, incorporating widely diversified repertoire and performance venues 2018 Implementation of Apprentice Connection program\u2014for HS singers\u2014To rehearse & perform in a professional choral ensemble environment and to apply & build upon education gained from current HS choral director 2016 Performance of the Dan Forrest (Young/Living/Contemporary composer) Requiem for the Living (His largest work\u2014Published in 2013) joined by Louisville Philharmonia\u2014the Musicians' Orchestra, chorus and soloists 2009 6/09\u2014Return of Daniel Spurlock as Music Director 2009 Filming for perpetual INTERNATIONAL Broadcast on EWTN, largest global religious media network 2006 Collaborative performances of A German Requiem (Brahms) with Jewish Community Center Orchestra and YPAS Concert Choir 2003 Appointment of S.
