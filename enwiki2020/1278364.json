St Augustine Gospels, Parker Library MS 286, late 6th century Sedulius (sometimes with the nomen Coelius or Caelius, both of doubtful authenticity) was a Christian poet of the first half of the 5th century. ==Biography== Extremely little is known about his life. Sedulius is the Latin form of the Irish name Siadhal, referring to the a family, sept or \"siadhal\" meaning \"seed.\" The only trustworthy information is given by his two letters to Macedonius, from which we learn that he devoted his early life, perhaps as a teacher of rhetoric, to secular literature. Late in life he converted to Christianity, or, if a Christian before, began to take his faith more seriously. One medieval commentary states that he resided in Italy. He is termed a presbyter by Isidore of Seville and in the Gelasian decree. ==Works== His fame rests mainly upon a long poem, Carmen paschale, based on the four gospels. In style a bombastic imitator of Virgil, he shows, nevertheless, a certain freedom in the handling of the Biblical story, and the poem soon became a quarry for the minor poets. His description of the Four Evangelists in Carmen Paschale became well-known; the English translation below is from . His other writings include an Abecedarian hymn in honour of Christ, A solis ortus cardine, consisting of twenty-three quatrains of iambic dimeters. This poem has partly passed into the liturgy, the first seven quatrains forming the Christmas hymn \"A solis ortus cardine\";This incipit was borrowed for the Carolingian Planctus de obitu Karoli; see Peter Godman (1985), Latin Poetry of the Carolingian Renaissance (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press), 206-211. and the Epiphany hymn, \"Hostis Herodes impie.\" A \"Veteris et novi Testamenti collatio\" in elegiac couplets has also come down, but we have no grounds for ascribing to him the Virgilian cento, \"De verbi incarnatione.\" ==Editions== *Faustino Ar\u00e9valo (Rome, 1794), reprinted in Jacques Paul Migne's Patrologia Latina vol. xix. *Johann Huemer (Vienna, 1885). *Victoria Panagl (Bearb.), Sedulius, Opera Omnia, Ex Recensione Iohannis Huemer (Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum, 10), Wien, 2007, XLVII, 532 S. * ==Further reading== *Roger P H Green, Latin Epics of the New Testament: Juvencus, Sedulius, Arator, Oxford UP 2008 (reviewed by Teresa Morgan in the article \"Poets for Jesus\", Times Literary Supplement 4 April 2008 p 31). ==References== * This work in turn cites: **Johann Huemer, De Sedulii poetae vita et scriptis commentatio (Vienna, 1878) **Max Manitius, Geschichte der christlich-lateinischen Poesie (Stuttgart, 1891) **Teuffel- Schwabe, History of Roman Literature (Eng. trans.), 473 **Herzog-Hauck, Realencyklop\u00e4die f\u00fcr protestantische Theologie, xviii.
