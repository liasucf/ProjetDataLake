He graduated from the present-day University of Economics in Bratislava and was a bank employee of the St\u00e1tn\u00ed banka \u010deskoslovensk\u00e1 and of other banks. As such, he spent some years in London and in Cuba in the 1960s. During the Normalization he was subject to some persecution. ==Political career== During and after the Velvet Revolution, from 12 December 1989 to 17 May 1991 (when he resigned) Kov\u00e1\u010d was the Finance Minister of the Slovak (Socialist) Republic. In early 1991, he was one of the founders and the vice-chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia. As such, he was elected as a deputy to the Federal Assembly of Czechoslovakia in 1990. After the 1992 election he served as the Chairman of the Federal Assembly from 25 June to 31 December 1992. He played an important role in the process of the preparation of the Dissolution of Czechoslovakia. ===President (1993\u201398)=== Kov\u00e1\u010d was elected president by the National Council of Slovakia in February 1993 (because he was a candidate of the biggest parliamentary party\u2014the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia) and inaugurated on 2 March 1993. He soon became a strong opponent of Prime Minister Vladim\u00edr Me\u010diar and by giving a critical presidential address to parliament in March 1994, Kov\u00e1\u010d significantly contributed to the deposition of the then Me\u010diar government and the creation of the Morav\u010d\u00edk government (which only lasted until the next parliamentary election in the autumn of 1994). In 1995 the Me\u010diar-Kov\u00e1\u010d conflict intensified and the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia cancelled Kov\u00e1\u010d's (formal) membership in the party. In August 1995 Kov\u00e1\u010d's son, who had been accused of financial crimes by German authorities (the accusation was later withdrawn), was kidnapped and taken to Austria. The president, opposition parties and Austrian court accused the Slovak intelligence service (SIS) and the government of having organized this kidnapping. The investigation of new secret intelligence service director Mitro and Slovak police after collapse of Meciar's regime in the end of 1998 confirmed the participation of the SIS on this kidnap but the Slovak justice rejected the trial with its suspected actors because of an amnesty (also called self-amnesty) issued by Vladimir Meciar on 3 March 1998. Kov\u00e1\u010d's term ended on 2 March 1998. His candidature in the first direct 1999 Slovak presidential election was unsuccessful. He was not very visible in Slovakian politics after this time and appeared only at a few symbolic events. ==Health and death== On 10 July 2008 the Slovak media reported that Kov\u00e1\u010d probably suffered from Parkinson's disease. The former president did not confirm this information but admitted that he had some health problems. On 5 October 2016, Kov\u00e1\u010d died from complications of Parkinson's disease in Bratislava, aged 86. ==Honours== *: Grand Master and Grand Cross (or 1st Class) of the Order of the White Double Cross. *: Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland (1994) *: Order of the White Eagle (1997) *: Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (1997) *In 1993, Kovac became the first winner of the Golden Biatec Award, the highest award bestowed by Slovakia\u2019s Informal Economic Forum - Economic Club.http://www.hospodarskyklub.sk/index.cgi?klub2001 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1930 births Category:2016 deaths Category:People from Humenn\u00e9 District Category:People's Party \u2013 Movement for a Democratic Slovakia politicians Category:Presidents of Slovakia Category:Finance ministers of Slovakia Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of the White Double Cross Category:University of Economics in Bratislava alumni ",
