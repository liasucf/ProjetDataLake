The original students came primarily from the Carson Road and Pineview neighbourhoods. During the 1980s and early 90s, students from Fallingbrook in Orleans were bussed to the school. Eventually, the entire school was home to students bussed from Orleans while a new campus was built at its current location on Tenth Line Road. After moving to the new location, students from Pineview/Carson Road attended Gloucester High School and the building was eventually purchased by the French Catholic school board as the new home for Coll\u00e8ge Catholique Samuel-Genest. == School layout == Sir Wilfrid Laurier is a two-story school. It includes a full resource library, and number of computer labs which hosts classes and individual work. The gym can be split into three divisions, creating space to host multiple activities or host larger sports games. Close to the gymnasium is a fitness room which includes treadmills, bench press equipment, and a variety of exercise machines. There is also a track at the back of the school and an outdoor basketball court. With the connection to the Ray Friel Recreational Complex, gym classes are able to access the swimming pool, skating rink, and public library. The school also has a broadcasting lab which is used for its broadcasting program. == Extra-curricular activities == The school participates in a wide range of sports for both males and females.
