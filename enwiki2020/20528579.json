    "text": "Hall/Nimbus is a train station in Beaverton, Oregon, United States, that is served by TriMet as part of its WES Commuter Rail line. The station is the second southbound stop of the five-station, line that runs from Beaverton in the north to Wilsonville in the south in the Portland metropolitan area. At the northern terminus at Beaverton Transit Center, passengers can connect to the Blue and Red lines of MAX Light Rail. Opened in January 2009, the TriMet- owned station includes a 50-car park-and-ride lot and a connection to TriMet bus route 76\u2013Hall/Greenburg. It is located near Washington Square along Oregon Route 217 (OR 217). ==History== Plans for a commuter rail line running between Beaverton and Wilsonville began as early as 1996. A design proposal in 2002 envisioned a station serving the Washington Square mall on Scholls Ferry Road west of OR 217 called \"Scholls Ferry/Washington Square\", later shortened to just \"Washington Square\". An environmental analysis resulted in the steering committee's support for a northerly shift of this station to just south of Hall Boulevard to leverage opportunities associated with nearby developments and anticipated transit improvements. The Federal Transit Administration approved the rail line\u2019s construction in 2004. Work on the overall project began in October 2006. By 2008, TriMet had renamed the station \"Hall/Nimbus\" and construction began that year; it was the last station to be built. On September 3, the public artwork was installed at the still-under-construction station. Originally scheduled to open in the fall, the station and the line opened on February 2, 2009. ==Station details== {|table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=60 rowspan=4 valign=top|Platform level |- |style=\"border- top:solid 1px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2| |- |width=100| Northbound |width=420|\u2192 WES toward Beaverton Transit Center (Terminus) \u2192 |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Southbound |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"| \u2190 WES toward (Tigard Transit Center) |} Hall/Nimbus station is one of five on the WES Commuter Rail line that utilizes Portland and Western Railroad\u2019s freight rail line. WES operates only during the morning and evening commute times from Monday through Friday.

The public artwork at the stop is an interactive sculpture created by Frank Boyden and Brad Rude made of steel and bronze, with blue accents. The Interactivator features bronze heads and a U-shaped vehicle designed to represent the train and the variety of people who ride the line.
