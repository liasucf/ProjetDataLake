    "text": "Youbian dubian (), or dubanbian (), is a rule of thumb people use to pronounce a Chinese character when they do not know its exact pronunciation. A longer version is (y\u01d2u bi\u0101n d\u00fa bi\u0101n, m\u00e9i bi\u0101n d\u00fa zh\u014dngji\u0101n lit. \"read the side if any; read the middle part if there is no side\"). Around 90% of Chinese characters are phono-semantic compounds that consist of two parts: a semantic part (often the radical) that suggests a general meaning (e.g. the part \u8c9d [shell] usually indicates that a character concerns commerce, as people used shells as currency in ancient times), and a phonetic part which shows how the character is or was pronounced (e.g. the part \u7687 (pinyin: hu\u00e1ng) usually indicates that a character is pronounced hu\u00e1ng in Mandarin Chinese). The phonetic part represents the exact or almost-exact pronunciation of the character when the character was first created; characters sharing the same phonetic part had the same reading. Linguists rely heavily on this fact to reconstruct the sounds of ancient Chinese. However, over time, the reading of a character may be no longer the one indicated by the phonetic part due to sound change and general vagueness.Cf. Qiu Xigui, Chinese Writing, trans. Gilbert L. Mattos and Jerry Norman, Early China Special Monograph Series No. 4, Berkeley: The Society for the Study of Early China and the Institute of East Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley, 2000, \u00a78.6. When one encounters such a two-part character and does not know its exact pronunciation, one may take one of the parts as the phonetic indicator. For example, reading \u8a63 (pinyin: y\u00ec) as zh\u01d0 because its \"side\" \u65e8 is pronounced as such. Some of this kind of \"folk reading\" have become acceptable over time - listed in dictionaries as alternative pronunciations, or simply become the common reading. For example, people read the character \u753a ting in \u897f\u9580\u753a (Ximending) as if it were \u4e01 ding. It has been called a \"phenomenon of analogy\", and is observed in as early as the Song Dynasty.Zhu Jianing \u7afa\u5bb6\u5be7, \"Songdai yuyin de leihua xianxiang\" \u5b8b\u4ee3\u8a9e\u97f3\u7684\u985e\u5316\u73fe\u8c61, in Jindai yin lunji \u8fd1\u4ee3\u97f3\u8ad6\u96c6, Taipei: Taiwan xuesheng shuju, 1994, pp. 159-172. ==See also== * The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy ==Notes== ==External links== * Feng, Shouzhong (S: \u51af\u5bff\u5fe0, T: \u99ae\u58fd\u5fe0, P: F\u00e9ng Sh\u00f2uzh\u014dng), \u300a\u4e0e\u8bfb\u534a\u8fb9\u6709\u5173\u7684\u5e38\u7528\u5b57\u300b (Archive), \u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u5b57\u7f51 Y\u01d4y\u00e1n W\u00e9nz\u00ec W\u01ceng\u3002 Category:Chinese characters ",
