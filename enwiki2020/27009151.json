    "text": "This page documents the tornadoes and tornado outbreaks of 1991, primarily in the United States. Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes, however by the 1990s tornado statistics were coming closer to the numbers we see today. ==Synopsis== The Tornado \"Season\" of 1991 looks generally very average on paper. The spring months of March, April, May and June all saw very large numbers of tornadoes and tornado outbreaks. The fall, sometimes referred to as a \"second season\", was very quiet. The Andover, Kansas outbreak of April 26, 1991 was famous for its violent tornadoes, incredible video and is the signature event of this tornado season. 1991 saw one F5 tornado touch down in Kansas. ==Events== Confirmed tornado total for the entire year 1991 in the United States. ==January== There were 29 tornadoes confirmed in the US in January. ==February== There were 11 tornadoes confirmed in the US in February. ==March== There were 157 tornadoes confirmed in the US in March. ===March 22=== Tornadoes killed six people in Kentucky and Tennessee. An 11-year-old boy was killed in Olmstead in Logan County, Kentucky when an F2 tornado picked up a mobile home and slammed it against a tree. ===March 26\u201327=== March 26 saw an outbreak of 21 tornadoes, including an F4 twister near Hutchinson, Kansas (no fatalities). Two more people were killed by tornadoes in Wisconsin and Indiana on March 27. ===March 29=== An F1 tornado in Talladega County, Alabama killed five people. ==April== There were 204 tornadoes confirmed in the US in April. === April 26 === This violent tornado outbreak of 55 tornadoes took place on April 26, 1991, killing 24 people and injuring hundreds more. The killer Andover tornado was rated F5, while four others were rated F4, including the monstrous Red Rock tornado. At the time, the Red Rock tornado generated the highest wind speeds, detected by mobile doppler radar, until the May 3, 1999, Bridge Creek-Moore F5 tornado. This is also the outbreak from which the infamous video was shot by a news crew hiding under an overpass in Kansas. This early viral video spread the myth that sheltering underneath an overpass was safer during a tornado. The television crew was hit by a F2 tornado. ==May== There were 335 tornadoes confirmed in the US in May. ===May 10=== Three tornadoes formed in Lazbuddie, Texas. ===May 15=== An outbreak of five tornadoes struck Western and Northwestern Oklahoma. The strongest was a 800\u2013900 yard wide F3 tornado that tracked 11.5 miles near Laverne, injuring three people. The same cell also dropped hail up to the size of grapefruits. ==June== There were 216 tornadoes confirmed in the US in June. ===June 14=== An F0 tornadic waterspout (starts as a tornado) reported near Lake Okeechobee, Florida created a surreal nighttime sight of a tornado and lightning while only doing minor damage. A famous photo of the event, which includes a mixture of brown and black color of the tornado accompanied with a lightning strike, was taken by Fred Smith, who was photographing the tornado from his backyard. ==July== There were 64 tornadoes confirmed in the US in July, including one in Cass County, Minnesota featured on some tornado-themed documentaries. ==August== There were 46 tornadoes confirmed in the US in August. ==September== There were 26 tornadoes confirmed in the US in September. ==October== There were 21 tornadoes confirmed in the US in October. ==November== There were 20 tornadoes confirmed in the US in November. ===November 29=== An F4 tornado tore through areas near Springfield, Missouri, killing two people. ==December== There were 3 tornadoes confirmed in the US in December. ==See also== * Tornado ** Tornadoes by year ** Tornado records ** Tornado climatology ** Tornado myths * List of tornado outbreaks ** List of F5 and EF5 tornadoes ** List of North American tornadoes and tornado outbreaks ** List of 21st-century Canadian tornadoes and tornado outbreaks ** List of European tornadoes and tornado outbreaks ** List of tornadoes and tornado outbreaks in Asia ** List of Southern Hemisphere tornadoes and tornado outbreaks ** List of tornadoes striking downtown areas * Tornado intensity ** Fujita scale ** Enhanced Fujita scale ==References== ==External links== * U.S. tornadoes in 1991 - Tornado History Project * Tornado deaths monthly Category:1991 meteorology Category:Tornado-related lists by year Torn ",
