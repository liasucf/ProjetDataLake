    "text": "The Williamsport Crosscutters are a Class A-Short Season Minor League Baseball team based in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, in the United States. They are a Philadelphia Phillies affiliate in the short-season New York\u2013Penn League, playing their home games at BB&T; Ballpark at Historic Bowman Field, the second oldest minor league ballpark in the United States. ==History== Through 1993, the club was the Geneva Cubs, playing in Geneva, New York. For the 1994 season, the club moved to Williamsport, occupying a historic facility that had not been used for professional baseball for the previous two seasons. The club became known as the Williamsport Cubs, a Class A short season affiliate of the Chicago Cubs, retaining that name through 1998. In 1999, the team switched affiliations from the Chicago Cubs to the Pittsburgh Pirates and the team name became \"the Crosscutters\". At the end of the 2006 season, the team became an affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies, with the Pittsburgh affiliation switching to the State College Spikes. The Crosscutters shared the New York\u2013Penn League championship with the Brooklyn Cyclones in 2001, after losing the first game of the series. Both teams were declared champions after the remainder of the series was canceled in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks. The Crosscutters again made the playoffs in 2002 but were eliminated in the first round. However, the team returned to win the championship series, against the Cyclones, in 2003. The name \"Crosscutters\" reflects the logging heritage of Williamsport, once known as the \"Lumber Capital of the World.\" The city, historically having the largest amount of millionaires per capita, is on the West Branch Susquehanna River, and logging barons once lived in mansions along Fourth Street, which became known as \"Millionaires' Row\". To this day, sports teams at Williamsport Area High School are known as the Millionaires. The 2015 season saw the Williamsport Crosscutters clinch their first Pinckney Division Championship since 2001. On September 18, 2017, the Crosscutters announced that its Player Development Contract (PDC) had been extended by the Phillies through the 2020 season. In 2017, the team\u2019s total attendance at BB&T; Ballpark at Bowman Field was 61,082. ==Championships== In 2001, the Crosscutters and Brooklyn Cyclones were declared the New York\u2013Penn League's co-champions. The Crosscutters lost the first game of the best of three championship series, and the rest of the series was cancelled after the September 11, 2001 attacks. In 2003, the Crosscutters won the New York\u2013Penn League championship outright, defeating the Cyclones in two games to sweep the series. In 2015, the Crosscutters won the New York-Penn League Pinckney Division, posting a league best record of 46-30. The Crosscutters would be eliminated from the playoffs by the West Virginia Black Bears two games to one. The Black Bears would go on to win the 2015 New York Penn League Championship. ==Playoffs== *2001: Defeated Jamestown 2-1 in semifinals; declared co-champions with Brooklyn. *2002: Lost to Staten Island 2-0 in semifinals. *2003: Defeated Auburn 2-0 in semifinals; defeated Brooklyn 2-0 to win championship. *2005: Lost to Staten Island 2-0 in semifinals. *2015: Lost to West Virginia 2-1 in semifinals. ==Logos and uniforms== File:Williamsport Crosscutters (logo).png|Cutters' secondary File:Cutters.PNG|Cutters' former primary File:Williamsport Crosscutters Logo.PNG|Cutters' primary The official colors of the Williamsport Crosscutters are Phillies red, navy blue, gray, dark tan, and ivory.Crosscutters new identity The team most recently changed its brand prior to the 2008 season, one year following an affiliation change from the Pittsburgh Pirates to the Philadelphia Phillies.
