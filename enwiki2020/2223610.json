    "text": "\"Show You the Way to Go\" is a song written by Gamble and Huff and recorded by the Jacksons for their 1976 CBS debut album, The Jacksons. Released as a single in early 1977, it was the only number-one song for the group in the UK. It was later covered by Dannii Minogue in 1992. ==The Jacksons version== \"Show You the Way to Go\" became a hit for the Jacksons, (formerly known as \"The Jackson 5\") after their departure from Motown nearly two years prior. The move made it easy for the brothers to write and produce their own material. They spent a couple of years under the production and direction of Gamble and Huff and were signed to Philadelphia International Records. This was one of the songs that the producers wrote for the brothers. This song was released after \"Enjoy Yourself,\" released a year earlier. Michael sang lead and background vocals. Marlon Jackson, and the rest of the brothers (Randy having replaced Jermaine) had backup parts. The song reached No. 6 US Billboard R&B; chart, No. 28 US Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart. After recording the album Goin' Places in 1977, the Jacksons left Philadelphia International for Epic. The single's B-side was \"Blues Away\", which was the first song Michael Jackson wrote entirely himself. ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1977) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Canada | style=\"text-align:center;\"|52 |- |align=\"left\"|Ireland | style=\"text-align:center;\"|5 |- |align=\"left\"|UK | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |align=\"left\"|US Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|28 |- |align=\"left\"|US Billboard R&B; | style=\"text-align:center;\"|6 |- |align=\"left\"|US Cash Box Top 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|45 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1977) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Position |- |UK | style=\"text-align:center;\"|28 |- |US Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|171 |} ===Personnel=== *Lead vocals by Michael Jackson *Background vocals by Michael Jackson, Tito Jackson, Marlon Jackson, Jackie Jackson and Randy Jackson *Instruments by Tito Jackson, Randy Jackson, MFSB ==Dannii Minogue version== Dannii Minogue's version was produced by Bruce Forest and Andy Whitmore and was the first single released from her second album, Get into You.
