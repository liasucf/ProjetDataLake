The tournament was held in Cairo, Egypt from 18 to 25 August 2017. 12 teams from the 5 confederations competed in the tournament. Argentina defeated defending champions Russia 4\u20132 in the final to claim their first title in the competition. This marked Argentina's first ever world title at any age group. Cuba won the bronze medal outclassing Brazil 4\u20131. Germ\u00e1n Johansen from Argentina was elected the MVP. After this tournament, FIVB declared that \"As per decision of May 2019 FIVB Board of Administration, the U23 WCH has been abolished.\" ==Qualification== The FIVB Sports Events Council revealed a proposal to streamline the number of teams participating in the Age Group World Championships. {| class=\"wikitable\" width=930 |- !width=32% colspan=\"2\"|Means of Qualification!!width=21%|Date!!width=19%|Venue!!width=6%|Vacancies!!width=17%|Qualifiers |- |colspan=\"2\"|Host Nation||2 February 2016|| Lausanne||align=\"center\"|1|| |- |colspan=\"2\"|2016 South American Championship||21\u201325 June 2016|| Cartagena||align=\"center\"|1|| |- |colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|2016 European Qualifiers||rowspan=\"2\"|27\u201331 July 2016||rowspan=\"2\"| Zagreb||rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"|2|| |- | |- |rowspan=\"3\"|2016 Pan-American Cup||For CSV||rowspan=\"3\"|5\u201310 September 2016||rowspan=\"3\"| Guanajuato City||align=\"center\"|1|| |- |rowspan=\"2\"|For NORCECA||rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"|2|| |- | |- |colspan=\"2\"|2017 African Championship||21\u201322 February 2017|| S\u00e9tif||align=\"center\"|1|| |- |colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|2017 Asian Championship||rowspan=\"2\"|1\u20139 May 2017||rowspan=\"2\"| Ardabil||rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"|2|| |- | |- |colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|World Ranking||rowspan=\"2\"|January 2017||rowspan=\"2\"| Lausanne||rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"|2|| |- | |- !colspan=\"4\"|Total!!12!! |} ==Pools composition== Teams were seeded following the Serpentine system according to their FIVB U23 World Ranking as of January 2017. FIVB reserved the right to seed the hosts as head of pool A regardless of the U23 World Ranking.

Matches in Cairo will be played to best-of-seven sets with each set to 15 points (with at least a two-point difference needed). Three ranking points will be awarded to teams winning 4\u20130, 4\u20131 or 4\u20132. Two points go the winner of a 4\u20133 match with one point for the loser. It is hoped that the new scoring system will reduce overall duration of matches, while making each set more attractive and exciting \u2013 much as tie-breaks are under the current regulations. The interval between sets is reduced to two minutes (from three). Teams will switch ends after the second set - and also, if needed, after sets 4, 5 and 6. In addition, there will be no technical timeouts \u2013 just two regular thirty-second timeouts per team per set. The basic principles for the new scheme were tested for the first time in the Dutch League in the 2016\u201317 season. Further testing of the scheme will be conducted at the Women's U23 World Championship in Ljubljana. During and after the competition, players, coaches, referees and officials will be evaluating the new system through a questionnaire, while duration and scoring statistics will be gathered and analysed. This is the second time that the Men's U23 World Championship serves as a testbed for new regulations. Matches of the inaugural edition in 2013 in Uberl\u00e2ndia were played to 21-point sets. In addition to the scoring system, a new serving regulation will be tried out in Cairo, with the server not allowed to land inside the court after a jump service. The testing of the new rules has been received with criticism from the volleyball community. ==Pool standing procedure== # Number of matches won # Match points # Sets ratio # Points ratio # Result of the last match between the tied teams Match won 4\u20130, 4\u20131 or 4\u20132: 3 match points for the winner, 0 match points for the loser Match won 4\u20133: 2 match points for the winner, 1 match point for the loser ==Preliminary round== *All times are Eastern European Time (UTC+02:00). {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |- |width=10px bgcolor=#ccffcc| ||Qualified for the Semifinals |- |width=10px bgcolor=#dfefff| ||Qualified for the 5th\u20138th semifinals |} ===Pool A=== ===Pool B=== ==Final round== *All times are Eastern European Time (UTC+02:00). ===5th\u20138th places=== ====5th\u20138th semifinals==== ====7th place match==== ====5th place match==== ===Final four=== ====Semifinals==== ====3rd place match==== ====Final==== ==Final Standing== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !width=40|Rank !width=180|Team |- | |align=left| |- | |align=left| |- | |align=left| |- |4 |align=left| |- |5 |align=left| |- |6 |align=left| |- |7 |align=left| |- |8 |align=left| |- |rowspan=2|9 |align=left| |- |align=left| |- |rowspan=2|11 |align=left| |- |align=left| |} {| style=\"text-align: center; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\" |- |12\u2013man Roster |- |Mat\u00edas S\u00e1nchez, Brian Melgarejo, Jan Mart\u00ednez, Edgar Vieira, Ignacio Luengas, Gaspar Bitar, Santiago Danani, Liam Arreche, Gast\u00f3n Fern\u00e1ndez (c), Agust\u00edn Loser, Andr\u00e9s Arduino, Germ\u00e1n Johansen |- |Head Coach |- |Camilo Soto |} ==Awards== *Most Valuable Player : Germ\u00e1n Johansen *Best Setter : Mat\u00edas S\u00e1nchez *Best Outside Spikers : Denis Bogdan : Miguel Guti\u00e9rrez *Best Middle Blockers : Ivan Iakovlev : Matheus Santos *Best Opposite Spiker : Hisham Ewais *Best Libero : Rog\u00e9rio Filho ==See also== *2017 FIVB Volleyball Women's U23 World Championship ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:FIVB Volleyball Men's U23 World Championship FIVB Volleyball Men's U23 World Championship Category:International volleyball competitions hosted by Egypt Category:2017 in Egyptian sport FIVB Volleyball Men's U23 Category:Sports competitions in Cairo ",
