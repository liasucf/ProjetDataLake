    "text": "The Vienna Hofoper (now Staatsoper), pictured in 1898 during Mahler's conductorship The Repertory of the Vienna Court Opera under Gustav Mahler is an account of the ten years during which Gustav Mahler held the office of director and when he directed the productions of more than 100 different operas, of which 33 had not previously been staged at the Hofoper and three were world premieres. Another 55 were presented in either entirely new or substantially revised productions. In all, almost 3,000 performances took place at the Hofoper during Mahler's tenure,De La Grange, Vol. 3 pp. 391\u201394 of which Mahler conducted more than 600. Mahler, well known as a symphonic composer, joined the Vienna Court Opera (the Hofoper) in May 1897 as a staff conductor and director-designate, pending confirmation of his appointment as director. After his confirmation in October 1897, he remained in the post until his resignation in November 1907. Conducting duties were shared among staff conductors whose numbers included at various times Gustav Brecher, Johann Nepomuk Fuchs, Joseph Hellmesberger, Jr., Karl Luze, Hans Richter, Franz Schalk, Francesco Spetrino, Bruno Walter and Alexander Zemlinsky. At the start of Mahler's tenure, stage designs were under the control of Anton Brioschi, the Hopfoper's official designer since 1886, and his assistant Heinrich Lefler.De La Grange, Vol. 2 p. 516 However, from 1903, new designs were increasingly the work of Alfred Roller, a member of the Secessionist group of artists into which circle Mahler had been introduced by his wife Alma. (7. Vienna 1897\u20131907) Roller was appointed to the Hofoper from June 1903; his innovative and experimental stage designs have been called \"more remarkable than [Mahler's] additions to the repertoire\".Blaukopf, p. 168 ==Operas performed, 1897\u20131907== ===Performances of existing repertory works=== The following operas were in the Hofoper repertory when Mahler assumed the directorship in 1897. Each had one or more revivals during the period of Mahler's tenure. Most of these older productions were significantly revised under Mahler; in some instances, entirely new productions of the works were mounted. The list does not included ballets or other entertainments. {|Class = \"wikitable sortable\" |- !Opera title !Composer !Total performances 1897\u20131907 !Notes !Refs |- |Africaine, L' |Meyerbeer, Giacomo |align=\"center\"|19 | |De La Grange, Vol. 3 p. 941 |- |Aida |Verdi, Giuseppe |align= \"center\"|84 |New production from 11 May 1903 | |- |Am W\u00f6rther See |Koschat, Thomas |align= \"center\"|6 | | |- |Ballo in Maschera, Un |Verdi, Giuseppe |align= \"center\"|29 |Revised production from 5 March 1898 Second revision from 19 May 1906 | |- |Barbiere di Siviglia |Rossini, Giaochino |align= \"center\"|16 |Revised production from 25 December 1906 | |- |Bartered Bride, The |Smetana, Bed\u0159ich |align= \"center\"|57 |Revised production from 20 September 1899, designed Anton Brioschi | |- |Carmen |Bizet, Georges |align= \"center\"|85 |Revised production from 26 May 1900, designed Brioschi | |- |Cavalleria rusticana |Mascagni, Pietro |align= \"center\"|131 | | |- |Cosi fan tutti |Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus |align= \"center\"|8 |New production from 4 October 1900, designed Brioschi.
