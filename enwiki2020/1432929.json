    "text": "Hans Heinrich Lammers (27 May 1879 \u2013 4 January 1962) was a German jurist and prominent Nazi politician. From 1933 until 1945 he served as Chief of the Reich Chancellery under Adolf Hitler. During the 1948\u20131949 Ministries Trial, Lammers was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity and sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. == Early life == Born in Lublinitz (now Lubliniec, Poland) in Upper Silesia, the son of a veterinarian, Lammers completed law school at the universities of Breslau (Wroc\u0142aw) and Heidelberg, obtained his doctorate in 1904, and was appointed judge at the Amtsgericht (district court) of Beuthen (Bytom) in 1912. During World War I, as a volunteer and officer of the German Army, he received the Iron Cross, First and Second Class. After World War I he joined the national conservative German National People's Party (DNVP) and resumed his career as a lawyer reaching by 1922 the position of undersecretary at the Reich Ministry of the Interior. == Nazi career == In 1932, Lammers joined the Nazi Party and achieved rapid promotions: he was appointed head of the police department, and, after the Nazi seizure of power in 1933 State Secretary and Chief of the Reich Chancellery. At the recommendation of Reichsminister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick, he became the centre of communications and chief legal adviser for all government departments. From 1937, he was a member of Hitler's cabinet as a Reichsminister without Portfolio, and from 30 November 1939 a member of the Council of Ministers for the Defence of the Reich. In this position, he was able to review all pertinent documents regarding national security and domestic policy even before they were forwarded to Hitler in person. Historian Martin Kitchen explains that due to the centralization of power accorded to the Reich Chancellery and therefore to its head, Lammers became \"one of the most important men in Nazi Germany\". From the vantage point of most government officers, Lammers seemed to speak on behalf of Hitler, the ultimate authority within the Reich. Lammers was also one of the first officials to sign government correspondence with \"Heil Hitler\", which became a requisite greeting for civil servants and eventually so ubiquitous that failure to use it was considered an \"overt sign of dissidence\" which could trigger attention from the Gestapo. In 1940, Lammers was also promoted to honorary SS- Obergruppenf\u00fchrer. From January 1943, Lammers served as President of the cabinet when Hitler was absent from their meetings. Along with Martin Bormann, he increasingly controlled access to Hitler. By early 1943, the war produced a labour crisis for the regime. Hitler agreed to the creation of a three-man committee with representatives of the State, the army, and the Party in an attempt to centralise control of the war economy and over the home front. The committee members were Lammers (Chief of the Reich Chancellery), Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, chief of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Armed Forces High Command; OKW), and Bormann, who controlled the Party. Hitler seemed to be in agreement with this proposal since none of them posed a threat to his leadership nor would they disagree with him. The committee was intended to independently propose measures regardless of the wishes of various ministries, with Hitler reserving most final decisions to himself. The committee, soon known as the Dreierausschu\u00df (Committee of Three), met eleven times between January and August 1943. However, they ran up against resistance from Hitler's cabinet ministers, who headed deeply entrenched spheres of influence and were excluded from the committee. Seeing it as a threat to their power, Joseph Goebbels, Albert Speer, Hermann G\u00f6ring and Heinrich Himmler worked together to bring it down. The result was that nothing changed, and the Committee of Three declined into irrelevance. Over time Lammers lost power and influence because of the increasing irrelevancy of his position due to the war and as a consequence of Martin Bormann's growing influence with Hitler. ===1945=== In April 1945, Lammers was arrested by SS troops during the final days of the Nazi regime, in connection with the upheaval surrounding Hermann G\u00f6ring. On 23 April, as the Soviets tightened the encirclement of Berlin, G\u00f6ring consulted Luftwaffe General Karl Koller and Lammers. All agreed that G\u00f6ring was not only Hitler's designated successor but was to act as his deputy if Hitler ever became incapacitated. G\u00f6ring concluded that, by remaining in Berlin to face certain death, Hitler had incapacitated himself from governing. Acting on the matter, G\u00f6ring sent a telegram from Berchtesgaden, Bavaria, arguing that since Hitler was cut off in Berlin, he, G\u00f6ring, should assume leadership of Germany. G\u00f6ring set a time limit of 22:00 that night (23 April), after which he would consider Hitler incapacitated. The telegram was intercepted by Bormann, who convinced Hitler that G\u00f6ring was a traitor and that the telegram was a demand to resign or be overthrown. Hitler responded angrily, ordering SS troops to arrest G\u00f6ring. Soon afterward, Hitler removed G\u00f6ring from all of his offices and ordered G\u00f6ring, his staff and Lammers placed under house arrest at Obersalzberg. Lammers was taken prisoner by American forces, but in the meantime his wife, Elfriede (n\u00e9e Tepel), committed suicide near Obersalzberg (the site of Hitler's mountain retreat) in early May 1945, as did his younger daughter, Ilse, two days later. ===Post-war insights=== Lammers in 1947 facing trial for crimes against humanity Following the war's conclusion, Lammers provided Allied interrogators with some insights into the nature of the Third Reich's hierarchy. Postwar mythology was such that many were convinced Hitler had completely ostracized the aristocratic officers under his command, but the truth was somewhat different. Lammers reported to the Allies that Nazi kingpins and high-ranking Wehrmacht officers received lavish gifts, severance packages, expropriated estates, and huge cash awards. Recipients of such benefits included Generals Heinz Guderian, Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist, Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb, Gerd von Rundstedt, and one of the Holocaust's chief architects, Reinhard Heydrich. ==Trial and conviction== In April 1946, Lammers was a witness at the Nuremberg tribunal. Starting in April 1949, he was tried in the Ministries Trial, one of the subsequent Nuremberg trials, and sentenced to 20 years in prison. The sentence was later commuted to 10 years by U.S. High Commissioner John J. McCloy, and on 16 December 1951, he was released from Landsberg Prison. Lammers died on 4 January 1962 in D\u00fcsseldorf, and was buried in Berchtesgaden in the same plot as his wife and daughter. ==See also== *Bribery of senior Wehrmacht officers *Friedrich Wilhelm Kritzinger, Lammers' deputy, who represented the Reich Chancellery at the Wannsee Conference ==Notes== ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== * * from The Simon Wiesenthal Center * Category:1879 births Category:1962 deaths Category:People from Lubliniec Category:People from the Province of Silesia Category:Nazi Party politicians Category:People convicted by the United States Nuremberg Military Tribunals Category:SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Category:Nazi Party officials Category:Nazis who served in World War I Category:Recipients of the Iron Cross (1914), 1st class Category:University of Breslau alumni Category:Heidelberg University alumni Category:German prisoners and detainees Category:Prisoners and detainees of the United States military Category:Recipients of German presidential pardons Category:German jurists Category:German people convicted of crimes against humanity Category:Prussian Army personnel ",
