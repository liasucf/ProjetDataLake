Exceptions are three seasons when participants of Montenegrin Republic League gained promotion in Yugoslav First League or in the qualifiers for the top-flight, and five seasons when members of Republic League went to Yugoslav Third League. ===Lower tier=== Since 1968, Montenegrin regional league system was founded as official competition of fourth-tier. League was structured through three groups - Central (Srednja regija), South (Ju\u017ena regija) and North (Sjeverna regija).http://sjevernaregija.me/http://juznaregija.me/http://srednjaregija.me/ Winners of each group gained promotion to Montenegrin Republic League. From the other side, since 1968, three worst-placed members of Montenegrin Republic League were relegated to regional system, while the group depended from their geographical position. Same structure is kept in the competition of Montenegrin Third League since 2006. == See also == *Montenegrin clubs in Yugoslav football competitions (1946-2006) *Montenegrin Republic Cup (1947\u20132006) *Montenegrin Football Championship (1922-1940) *Montenegrin First League *Montenegrin First League playoffs *Montenegrin Cup *Montenegrin clubs in European football competitions *Montenegrin Derby *Montenegrin Second League *Montenegrin Third League *Football in Montenegro ==References== 3 Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1946 Category:1946 establishments in Montenegro ",
