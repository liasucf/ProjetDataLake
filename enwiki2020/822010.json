Its houses, chapels and churches are testimony to the height of the gold rush era. The history of the town, which is intertwined with the history of Goi\u00e1s state, and certain reminders of the wealth of past centuries carved in gold, can be seen in places such as the Museu das Bandeiras, built in 1761; the Col\u00e9gio Sant'Ana, founded in 1879 by Dominican friars; the church of Nossa Senhora d'Abadia, constructed in 1790, with its altar painted in blue and gold; and the Casa da Fundi\u00e7\u00e3o, dating from 1752, where the gold from the mines was cast. Surrounded by the Serra Dourada, Goi\u00e1s Velho is the native city of the poet Ana Lins dos Guimar\u00e3es Peixoto Bretas (1889-1985), better known as Cora Coralina. Although she started writing at 14 years of age, she published her first book when she was 75. In order to survive, she made and sold crystallised sweets. The house where she lived, one of the oldest in the city, dating from 1782, has become a museum, containing her furniture, personal possessions, documents and letters from illustrious correspondents such as the poet Carlos Drummond de Andrade (1902-1987) and the Bahian writer Jorge Amado, one of the main representatives of the literature of the North East region and one of the most widely read Brazilian authors both inside and outside the country. ==Festivals== In Goi\u00e1s, one of the most popular festivals is the Procession of the Fogar\u00e9u, which occurs on the Wednesday before Easter Sunday. It is one of the most traditional events of Holy Week in Brazil and only in Angra dos Reis is a similar procession celebrated. During the ceremony the farricocos (the people dressed in medieval robes and hoods that accompany processions of penitence) simulate Jesus' arrest by the Roman soldiers by running through the streets of the town at midnight with torches to the sound of drums. There is a great resemblance with some traditions that take place in Spain at the same time of year especially in Toledo and Sevilla. The darkness, the torches, and the speed of the men with covered faces create a medieval atmosphere. It was believed that the devil was loose in the streets of the town on that night, frightening all, especially the children. Originally, only men could participate but today that has changed. Superstitions like the presence of a werewolf and a headless mule are also manifested in this popular festival. Tourists come from far and wide to witness the spectacle. In 2006, according to the Diario da Manh\u00e3 a newspaper from Goi\u00e2nia, 10,000 tourists came to watch the procession. For photos see and . Another notable festival that happens yearly in the town is the FICA (Festival Internacional de Cinema e Video Ambiental, or International Environmental Film and Video Festival). The goal of FICA is to promote, screen and award prizes to short, medium and feature- length films, in the animation, fiction or documentary genres, that address environmental themes, as well as to promote actions in production and education in the film and environmental fields.
