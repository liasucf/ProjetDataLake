    "text": "The M-87 Orkan is a Yugoslavia fully automated self-propelled multiple rocket launcher. The generic M-87 project was configured with 12 launch tubes mounted on a FAP 2832 truck. It has a range of about 50 to 120 km, with the ability to deliver warheads, anti-tank and anti-personnel mines. The production of Orkan M-87 ceased in the early 1990s due to break-up of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. ==History== Development started as a joint SFRY and Iraqi project under the name of KOL-15 with professor Obrad Vu\u010durovi\u0107 as concept designer and chief engineer on projecthttp://www.vti.mod.gov.rs/fs/155/155.htm. In early talks with Iraq, Yugoslavia offered two options: *Development of a MRL with 12 barrels and a 50 km range *Development of a MRL with 4 barrels and a 120 km range Iraq chose the first option as did Yugoslavia. At the start of development two prototypes were built: one for Yugoslavia and one for Iraq. In accordance with requests from purchasers rockets were developed with cluster warheads. According to the chief operating officer of the Artillery department of Military Technical Institute Belgrade Professor Obrad Vu\u010durovi\u0107, Orkan was never a copy of any previous designs. The Yugoslav doctrine when developing the system was based on the premise that countries who copy designs are at least five years behind those who have the weapons developed. ==Characteristics== One battery of M-87 Orkans consist of: *four 8\u00d78 launchers *four 8\u00d78 resupply vehicles (each with 24 rockets) *one 8\u00d78 command post vehicle *two 4\u00d74 topographic survey light vehicles *two 4\u00d74 observation post light vehicles *one 4\u00d74 meteorological survey vehicle The FAP 2832 vehicle with its base platform is fitted with a central tyre pressure regulation system which is operated by the driver from within the cab, and to provide a more stable firing platform four stabilisers are lowered to the ground by remote control one at either side to the rear of the second roadwheel and two at the very rear. When travelling, the launcher is traversed to the front and the whole launcher is covered by a tarpaulin cover with integral bows. ===Rockets=== The rocket is 4.6 metres long and it is packed in a glass-ceramic housing and transported by the vehicle. Rockets are re-loaded by the FAP 3232 with a built-in crane. The rocket speed is 1000 m/s. Rockets with extended range are 4.88 m long and weigh 404 kg. A battery of 4 launchers with 16 barrels and 192 rockets can cover a target area of 3\u20134 km\u00b2. The following types of rockets are known: *M-87-APHE with a fragmentation warhead to 91 kg. Range 50 km. *M-87-APHE-ER with a fragmentation warhead to 91 kg. Range 65 km. *M-87-PFHE-ER pre-fragmented warhead containing double- size balls. Range 65 km. *M-87-ICM-AT with 288 piece shaped charge bomblets type KB-2 . Range 50 km. *M-87-ICM AP with 420 piece splinter bomblets. Range 50 km. *M-87-AT with 24 piece YU-S-AT (KPOM) mines with Magnetos. Range 50 km. Some of the rockets are no longer in production. ===Features=== Unique features at the time of introduction (1987) when compared to other MRLs operational at the time include: * Ability to disperse anti-tank or anti- personnel mines up to 50 km from the firing location. * Semi-automatic loading. * Preparations to fire take two minutes. * Automatic leveling. Automatic Leveling of weapon was very precise. The system has a TV camera corrector for correcting missile path. *Automatic barrel sight. *Hard chromed barrels without the need for cleaning. *Mines KB-2 with wings and parachutes with two fuses (magnetic and mechanism for self-destruction after 24 or up to 48 hours) According to Obrad Vu\u010durovi\u0107, Orkan's main feature was the ability to disperse anti-tank or anti-personnel mines from 5 to 50 km from the firing location. ==Modifications and versions== Orkan II in Partner 2011 military fairThere were a few modifications of Orkan M-87: * The first modification was made by Army of Republic of Srpska with two barrels placed on Luna R-65 launcher (ZIL-135). * FR Yugoslavia modified Krupp M-418/37 and placed two Orkan barrels on it. * Serbia developed the M-96 Orkan II modification. The simplest solution was to integrate four 262mm launch tubes on a ZIL-135 launcher as it required minimum investment. The basic purpose of these modified launchers can be restored. Newly developed rockets increased range of Orkan II to 65 km. * Orkan CER developed by Yugoimport SDPR based on KamAZ-6350. * Dominator M2/12 MLRS multi-caliber multiple launch rocket system developed by Yugoimport SDPR which uses 16 262mm Orkan rockets. ==Origins of TOROS artillery rocket system== In 1990s Turkey faced USA reluctance to share modern defense technology. In order to have domestic supply of multiple rocket launcher rockets and domestic launchers Turkey used reverse engineering and shortcuts in order to develop its own versions. In order to have a supply of 227mm rockets they reverse engineered M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System M26 rocket under project designation SAGE 227. For continuing work on development of domestic MRLS Turkey obtained Orkan M-87 documentation, launcher and rockets from Bosnia and Herzegovina Novi Travnik \"Bratstvo\" factory in 1995. They used them for development of a domestic 260mm rockets and launcher thus shortening development for more than 5 years. First launches of new 230 and 260mm rockets respectively based on 227 M26 and 262 Orkan rockets produced in Turkey from Orkan M-87 launcher were conducted in April 1999.http://www.bitav.org.tr/TR/pdf/TUBITAK_90lar_CGO_SOS.pdfhttp://rbase.new- factoria.ru/sites/default/files/gallery/s.gurov/11/01/14/toros_260a.jpg ==Operational history== Republic of Serbian Krajina used M-87 Orkan to retaliate after Croatian forces attacked United Nations Protected Areashttp://www.un.org/Depts/DPKO/Missions/unprof_b.htm where Serbs lived.Operation Flash#cite note-\u0160trbac 2005 225-102 ==Operators== Map with M-87 operators in blue and former operators in red ===Current operators=== * - 4 M-96 Orkan II ===Former operators=== * - 1 non-operational unit in Banja Luka, 1 completed and 3 partially assembled units destroyed along with rockets. * - 1 in reserve due to lack of adequate rocket ammunition, 1 in a museum * - 1 prototype and 4 Orkan launchers called \"Ababeel 50\" + 4 reload vehicles.
