    "text": "In differential geometry, Kawasaki's Riemann\u2013Roch formula, introduced by Tetsuro Kawasaki, is the Riemann\u2013Roch formula for orbifolds. It can compute the Euler characteristic of an orbifold. Kawasaki's original proof made a use of the equivariant index theorem. Today, the formula is known to follow from the Riemann\u2013Roch formula for quotient stacks. == References == *Tetsuro Kawasaki. The Riemann-Roch theorem for complex V-manifolds. Osaka J.
