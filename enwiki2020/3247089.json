    "text": "Khunyang Chhish or Kunyang Chhish ()is the second-highest mountain in the Hispar Muztagh, a subrange of the Karakoram mountains in Pakistan. Alternate variations of the name include Kunyang Kish and Khiangyang Kish, among others. Its height, also sometimes given as , is ranked 21st in the world and 8th in Pakistan (in a disputed territory). ==Location== Khunyang Chhish lies in the heart of the Hispar Muztagh, north of the Hispar Glacier, one of the major glaciers of the Karakoram. It rises on the southwest side of the Khunyang Glacier while Distaghil Sar (the highest peak of the Hispar Muztagh) dominates the glacier on its northern end. ==Notable features== Khunyang Chhish is the twenty-first-highest independent mountain in the world. It is also notable for its rise above local terrain: for example, it rises almost above its southern base camp on the Khunyang Glacier, and it rises above the Hunza valley in about . It is a steep, pointed, and complex peak; it easily rivals the slightly higher Distaghil Sar to the North, which has a more rounded profile. Not counting the two Pumari Chhish summits to the ENE, the Kunyang Chhish massive has five peaks: * Kunyang Chhish Main, * Kunyang Chhish South, , 700 m SSW, with a prominence of only about * Kunyang Chhish East , 2 km ESE, prominence. * Kunyang Chhish West, , 1.5 km W, prominence. Also known as Pyramid Peak. * Kunyang Chhish North, , 6 km NNE, prominence.

R. F. Jones. Their bodies were never recovered. The next attempt was in 1965 by a Japanese party mainly consists of the University of Tokyo members. They chose the south ridge of Khunyang Chhish, but another climber Takeo Nakamura died after the collapse of a narrow ridge at . The first ascent was accomplished by a Polish team led by Andrzej Zawada in 1971. They climbed a long route up the South Ridge of the peak from the Pumari Chhish Glacier. However, one of their members was killed in a crevasse accident. The second, and only other recorded ascent, climbed the Northwest Spur to the North Ridge. Two British climbers, Mark Lowe and Keith Milne, completed this route on July 11, 1988. The route had first been attempted in 1980, and had been attempted again in 1981, 1982 and 1987. The Himalayan Index lists three recent attempts on this peak, in 2000 and 2003. After four failed expeditions, starting in 2003, the East summit was first ascended in July 2013 by an Austrian/Swiss team over the South Wall. ==See also== * List of mountains in Pakistan * Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan * Highest mountains of the World * List of Ultras of the Karakoram and Hindu Kush ==References== * Jill Neate, High Asia: An Illustrated History of the 7000 Metre Peaks, * Orographical Sketch Map of the Karakoram by Jerzy Wala, 1990.

A Japanese expedition from Hokkaido University in 1979 was led by Kohei Echizenya climbed the north ridge of Kunyang Chhish (23,321 feet) to make the first ascent. Base Camp was placed on the Kunyang Glacier at 14,300 feet on June 17. They followed the same route as the expedition to Pumari Chhish as far as the north col. Three camps, the highest Camp IV at 22,000 feet, were established on the north ridge. All eight climbers got to the summit on July 11.
