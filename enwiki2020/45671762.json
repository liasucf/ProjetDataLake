Accessed January 15, 2020. \"Leyla McCalla has traveled a winding path as a musician, from the European classical canon to the folkways of her Caribbean heritage. Born into a Haitian-American family in Queens, she was raised in Maplewood, and brought up in the New Jersey public school system.\" where she attended Columbia High School. She lived in Accra, Ghana for two years as a teen. After a year at Smith College, she transferred to New York University to study cello performance and chamber music. In 2010 she then moved to New Orleans where she honed her craft playing music on the streets of the French Quarter. In addition to cello, she also plays banjo and guitar. ==Career== From 2011 to 2013, McCalla was a member of the Carolina Chocolate Drops. As of 2019 she is a member of Our Native Daughters. As of 2017, McCalla was touring with her New Orleans-based trio, which also included her Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois husband Daniel Tremblay on guitar, banjo, and iron triangle (ti fer); and Free Feral on vocals and guitar.

McCalla says the first song she wrote for the album was \"Heart of Gold\" because it provided \"a window into Hughes' thinking\". McCalla chose to dedicate this work to Hughes because she says \"reading his work made me want to be an artist.\" McCalla started working on the album 5 years prior to its release. Commentators have noted the influence of Louisiana musical traditions such as old Cajun fiddle melodies and trad-jazz banjo on the album. Members of the Carolina Chocolate Drops appear on the album. The album was financed at least in part through a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter which exceeded its goal of $5,000 to raise $20,000. ==Personal life== As of 2019, McCalla is married to fellow musician, and electrician, Daniel Tremblay. They live in the New Orleans area and have three children. ==Discography== * Vari-Colored Songs: A Tribute to Langston Hughes (February 4, 2014, Music Maker) * A Day for the Hunter, A Day for the Prey (May 20, 2016, Jazz Village/Harmonia Mundi) * Capitalist Blues (January 25, 2019, Jazz Village/PIAS) ===Collaborations=== * Carolina Chocolate Drops: Leaving Eden (February 24, 2012, Nonesuch) * Our Native Daughters: Songs of Our Native Daughters (February 22, 2019, Smithsonian Folkways) ==References== Category:Living people Category:1985 births Category:Columbia High School (New Jersey) alumni Category:People from Maplewood, New Jersey Category:Musicians from New York City Category:Musicians from New Orleans Category:African-American musicians Category:American musicians of Haitian descent Category:American cellists Category:American folk musicians Category:21st-century American musicians Category:Women cellists Category:Singers from Louisiana Category:21st-century American women musicians Category:21st-century American singers Category:21st-century American women singers Category:Carolina Chocolate Drops members ",
