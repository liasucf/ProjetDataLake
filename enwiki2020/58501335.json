    "text": "The Loyal Rangers, or Jessup's Loyal Rangers, was a volunteer regiment of Loyalists in the American Revolution established in 1781 by the amalgamation of several smaller units, including the King's Loyal Americans. They were commanded by Major Edward Jessup. Since they were formed late in the war they served mainly a defensive role, being stationed in Yamaska, Rivi\u00e8re-aux- Chiens, \u00cele aux Noix, and Dutchman\u2019s Point in present-day Vermont near Alburg. After the close of the revolution the regiment was disbanded and received grants of land from the British Crown in Upper Canada, now the province of Ontario, Canada: Edwardsburgh, Augusta, and part of Elizabethtown, now Brockville, on the St Lawrence River, as well as Ernestown, near Cataraqui (Kingston, Ontario). ==See also== *Upper Canada ==References== ==External links== * The King's Men: Loyalist Military Units * Category:Loyalist military units in the American Revolution ",
