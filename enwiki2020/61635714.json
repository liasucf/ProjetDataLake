There are separate competitions for Classic and Freestyle. In the Classic event, competitors are to fly horizontally with their arms and legs extended in an X-formation until they hit the water. Competitors curl into a fetal position just before entering the water, breaking the surface tension with their feet, knees and elbows to avoid serious injury; dives are judged on how long the diver holds the original pose.
