Arnold Arbor. 6: 145. 1925 The plant spreads by vigorous underground rhizomes which run along just beneath the soil surface, producing plantlets at the nodes. These can be used to propagate new plants, but if not removed they can become invasive. The species Pleioblastus variegatus (green and cream stripes), and P. viridistriatus (green and yellow stripes) have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Genetic research suggests that this genus may properly be part of the genus Arundinaria. ;SpeciesThe Plant List search for Pleioblastus ;formerly included see Acidosasa Ampelocalamus Chimonocalamus Drepanostachyum Oligostachyum Pseudosasa Sasaella Sinobambusa Yushania ==References== Category:Bambusoideae Category:Flora of China Category:Flora of Japan Category:Bambusoideae genera Category:Taxa named by Takenoshin Nakai ",
