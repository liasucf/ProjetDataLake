Fifteen years later, Daichi Ozora, a member of Xio's Lab Team who was orphaned when his parents got lost in the Ultra Flare, bonds and transforms into Ultraman X to battle threats from both aliens and monsters. He soon learns of the truth behind Ultra Flare and resolves to help Ultraman X to regain his physical body after the incident had trapped him in the form of computer data. In the middle of the series, Daichi learns how to properly summon a Cyber Monster and thus, bringing forth Cyber Gomora, a monster modelled after his childhood Spark Doll, Gomora, becoming one of Xio's new allies and an alternative for Daichi whenever X is unable to fight.

Because the energy's effect also weakens X, it nearly killed him during his fight with Tsurugi Demaaga, the first victim of Dark Thunder Energy.
