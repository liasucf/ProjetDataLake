    "text": "The Lanai Pumped Storage Project is a proposed pumped-storage hydropower facility in Lanai Island, Hawaii, United States. If built, it would offer a power generation capacity of 300 MW. pumped hydro energy-storage project for Hawaii. It is currently (as of 2020) under feasibility study by Gridflex Energy. The main purpose of the pumped storage project is to assist an increase in carbon-free but variable wind and solar power generation in Hawaii, by improving grid flexibility. Pumped storage is thus part of Hawaii's plan to get 70% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. In the proposal, Pacific Ocean would be used as the lower reservoir, reducing significantly construction cost, as only an upper reservoir would have to be built.https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2010/10/15/2010-25961/lanai- hydro-llc-notice-of-preliminary-permit-application-accepted-for-filing-and- soliciting-comments Although the United States already have 43 operating pumped-storage plants , this would be the first ever seawater pumped storage facility in the country. ==See also== *Energy in Hawaii *Wind power in Hawaii ==References== == External links == * http://www.renewgridmag.com/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.6106 * http://www.disappearednews.com/2010/10/more-industrialization-for-lanai.html * https://renewablesnow.com/news/us-gridflex-energy-to-build-300-mw-wind-energy- storage-facility-in-hawaii-121764/ Category:Pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations in the United States Category:Hydroelectric power plants in Hawaii Category:Energy in Hawaii Category:Wind power in Hawaii Category:Proposed hydroelectric power stations ",
