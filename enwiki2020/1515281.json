    "text": "People Just Like Us is the third live praise and worship album of contemporary worship music by Hillsong Church. ==Making of the album== People Just Like Us was recorded live at the Hills Entertainment Centre by Geoff Bullock, Darlene Zschech and the Hillsong team. It has the first release of one of the most famous modern Christian worship songs of all time, Shout to the Lord by Darlene Zschech. The Majority of the songs were written by Geoff Bullock, Russell Fragar, and Paul Iannuzzelli. == Reception == In December 1997 Norman Smith of Cross Rhythms rated the album as 2 out of 10 and described the video as showcasing \"glitzy, good looking, manufactured, well dressed, designer, brand new hairdo worship\" where \"only the beautiful, the groomed and the young are on display\". He opined that \"Although the songs themselves are sung with a certain conviction ... no matter how it's dressed up, and this dog's dinner of an offering ... [is a] contextless collection of schmaltzy, Sydney soap song[s]\". ==Track listing== # \"Introduction\" # \"People Just Like Us\" (Russell Fragar) - Lead Vocals: Debbie Steinhardt, Geoff Bullock & Darlene Zschech # \"Father of Lights\" (Geoff Bullock) - Lead Vocals: Darlene Zschech & David Evans # \"In the Name of the Lord\" (Bullock) - Lead Vocals: Darlene Zschech, David Evans & Geoff Bullock # \"You Rescued Me\" (Bullock) - Lead Vocal: Rob Eastwood # \"The Power and the Glory\" (Bullock) - Lead Vocals: David Evans & Darlene Zschech # \"Have Faith in God\" (Bullock) - Lead Vocals: David Evans, Geoff Bullock & Darlene Zschech # \"Your Love Keeps Following Me\" (Fragar) - Lead Vocals: Lucy Fisher # \"I Just Want to Praise the Lord\" (Bullock) - Lead Vocals: Darlene Zschech, David Evans & Geoff Bullock # \"Longin' for Your Touch\" (Paul Iannuzzelli & Tim Uluirewa) - Lead Vocal: David Evans # \"In the Silence\" (Iannuzzelli) - Lead Vocals: Darlene Zschech & David Evans # \"Just Let Me Say\" (Bullock) - Lead Vocals: Debbie Steinhardt & Geoff Bullock # \"Shout to the Lord\" (Darlene Zschech) - Lead Vocals: Darlene Zschech # \"Faith\" (Bullock) - Lead Vocals: Darlene Zschech, David Evans & Geoff Bullock ==Credits== Worship Pastor * Geoff Bullock Music Director * Russell Fragar Vocals Director * Darlene Zschech Choir Directors * Annabelle Chaffey * Janine Bullock Lead Vocals * Darlene Zschech * David Evans * Geoff Bullock * Lucy Fisher * Debbie Steinhardt * Rob Eastwood Backing Vocals * Lucy Fisher * Gail Dunshea * Deborah de Jong * Debbie Steinhardt * Steve McPherson * Rob Eastwood * The Hillsong Choir Piano * Geoff Bullock Additional Piano & Keyboards * Russell Fragar Keyboards * Paul Iannuzzelli Guitars * David Moyse * Allan Chard Bass Guitar * Paul Ewing Drums * Adam Simek Percussion * Stuart Fell Trumpet * Mark Gregory Saxophone * Paul Iannuzzelli * Jun Javier Flute * Jun Javier Executive Producer * Brian Houston Producers * Geoff Bullock * Darlene Zschech * Russell Fragar Engineer * Jeff Todd Post Production & Mixdown @ Rich Music Studios Assistant Engineers * Frazer Stuart * Phil Munroe Mastered by: William Bowden (at Festival Records) Front Of House Engineer * Nick Asha Foldback Engineer * Heath Graham Technical Director * Cameron Wade Photographer * Victoria Hawkins Artwork * Chris Perry Graphic Design * Asher Gregory == References == Category:1994 live albums Category:Hillsong Music live albums ",
