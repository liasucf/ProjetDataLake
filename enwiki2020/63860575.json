    "text": "Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape Architects (NBW) is an American landscape architecture firm based in New York, Charlottesville, and Houston, founded in 1985 by Warren Byrd and Susan Nelson, and led by Thomas Woltz. ==History== Warren Byrd and Susan Nelson founded Nelson Byrd Landscape Architects in 1985 in Charlottesville, Virginia. Thomas Woltz became a named partner in 2004 and sole owner of the firm in 2013. Building upon the work of Byrd, who was Woltz's mentor and professor at the University of Virginia, the firm has expanded its focus over the past ten years to include restoring damaged ecological landscapes and developing projects that combine agriculture, ecological restoration, and cultural use. Today, NBW projects include public parks, academic institutions, botanical gardens, memorial landscapes, corporate campuses, and urban planning. The firm has worked in Mexico, Italy, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada, China, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. The firm guided the cultural and ecological revitalization of Memorial Park, a nearly 1,500-acre municipal park in Houston. The project incorporated the many disparate parts of the park\u2019s program while supporting its overall ecology. At the Citygarden Sculpture Park, NBW transformed an unused plot within the 1.1-mile-long strip of open space called the Gateway Mall, located on one of downtown St. Louis\u2019s busiest streets, into a series of meandering paths meant to evoke the nearby Mississippi River. The park features sculptural work from contemporary and modern artists. The park, which opened in July 2009 to coincide with the Major League Baseball\u2019s All-Star Game to be held in the city that year, was conceived to be a \u201csculpture garden, urban park, and urban garden\u201d that took advantage of the existing change in elevation of the terrain to create distinct areas or bands containing trees, gardens, support and maintenance buildings, lawns, and water areas, with sculptures sited throughout. Another significant project is the Hudson Yards Plaza at the Hudson Yards development in New York City. Located within the largest private development in United States history, the plaza is formed by a series of elliptical forms that give shape to landscaped spaces. The attached public square has 28,000 plants and 225 trees, located on the platform upon which Hudson Yards is built, which is itself located on top of an active train yard. The plaza's southern side includes a canopy of trees, while the southeast entrance also contains a fountain. A \"'seasonally expressive' entry garden\" stands outside the entrance to the New York City Subway's 34th Street\u2013Hudson Yards station. The plaza also connects to the High Line, an elevated promenade at its south end. ==Notable Projects== * Rothko Chapel Master Plan, Houston, Texas * Mt.
