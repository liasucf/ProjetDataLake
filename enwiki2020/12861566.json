He was based in Merthyr Tydfil which was also home to Leo Callaghan, one of only three Welsh referees to control the English FA Cup Final. ==Career== ===Domestic=== King became a Football League linesman in 1977 and three years later was promoted to the referees List, aged thirty three. He featured quite frequently in the top division over the next few years and was selected as one of the first Premier League referees for 1992-93 while also continuing to referee Football League matches. His first ever match in the Premier League was the 2-1 home win by Coventry City over Middlesbrough at Highfield Road on 15 August 1992.First ever Premiership match, Coventry v.

He was having injury problems, as he had at various points in his career, and as a result left the List at the end of season 1993-94, a year before he was due to reach retirement age. ===International & Europe=== Internationally, he refereed the England against Northern Ireland Home International at Wembley in 1983.Home Internationals, England v.
