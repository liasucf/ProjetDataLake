    "text": "Midnight Marauders is the third studio album by American hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest, released on November 9, 1993, by Jive Records. Recording sessions for the album occurred at Battery Studios, Platinum Island Studios and Scorcerer Sound in New York City. Its production was mainly handled by Q-Tip, with contributions from Skeff Anselm, Large Professor and the group's DJ, Ali Shaheed Muhammad. A culmination of the group's two previous albums, it features an eclectic, gritty sound based on jazz, funk, soul and R&B; samples, in addition to socially conscious, positively-minded, and humorous lyrics. Midnight Marauders debuted at number eight on the Billboard 200 and number one on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The first two singles, \"Award Tour\" and \"Electric Relaxation\", charted on the Billboard Hot 100, before the release of the final single, \"Oh My God\". On January 14, 1994, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with shipments of 500,000 copies in the United States. It was certified platinum by the RIAA nearly a full year later, on January 11, 1995, with shipments of one million copies. The album received mostly positive reviews from critics. In the following years, Midnight Marauders has acquired further acclamation from within the hip hop community for its production, chemistry and influence, with some regarding it as the group's best work, and one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time. Several writers have credited it as a contributor to a \"second golden age\" of hip hop in the mid-1990s, as well as the pinnacle of the Native Tongues movement. ==Recording== A Tribe Called Quest sought to further develop the bass-heavy sound of its previous album, The Low End Theory, with group member Q-Tip setting up his production equipment in the house basement of fellow member Phife Dawg's grandmother.Large Professor Remembers His 'Witty, Sharp, Smooth' Friend Phife Dawg Billboard. Accessed on January 9, 2018. Phife Dawg explained, \"my grandmother gave him a key, the whole nine, he used to just go in and do his thing.\" Most of the album was planned in the basement, though Q-Tip also worked on outside projects there, including the beat for Nas's single \"One Love\", which appeared on his debut album Illmatic (1994). Rapper and producer Large Professor recalled the inviting, relaxed atmosphere in the basement: \"[Phife Dawg] would just be there chilling, watching a basketball game or something, playing a video game and just listening to the beats, like, 'Yeah, yeah, I like that right there.' It was just so casual and cool ... just kind of sitting there and chillin' out, going to get something to eat, going through sounds and picking the sounds out. Telling a few jokes, watching some television like that; it was really nice. It wasn't forced in any way.\" Phife Dawg recalled the pressure that the group faced to make a solid follow-up to The Low End Theory: \"Obviously, that's a two-year wait, so there was a lot of pressure like, 'Can they do it again?' Q-Tip is really hands on, Tip is a genius, so by the time he was finished sequencing the album, I was lookin' at him sayin, 'Yo, b, we did it again.'\" The album's title, Midnight Marauders, originated from Q-Tip's lyrics in the song \"Vibes and Stuff\" from The Low End Theory, though it was later interpreted by group member Ali Shaheed Muhammad that \"A Tribe Called Quest are like sound thieves looting for your ears.\" Recording sessions for Midnight Marauders took place at Battery Studios, Platinum Island Studios and Scorcerer Sound in New York City, over a period of nine months, and ended in September 1993. All songs were mixed at Battery Studios and mastered at The Hit Factory in New York City. Production was mainly handled by Q-Tip, with contributions from Skeff Anselm, Large Professor and Ali Shaheed Muhammad, who also contributed DJ scratching.Exclusive: Q-Tip Interview. MOOVMNT.com. Retrieved on 2018-01-09. Raphael Saadiq (credited as Raphael Wiggins) played bass guitar on the song \"Midnight\". The group hired Jive secretary Laurel Dann to be the album's \"tour guide\", having liked her voice, which is digitized throughout the album. With a sample of Cal Tjader's \"Aquarius\" as a backdrop, Dann opens the album on the track \"Midnight Marauders Tour Guide\", introducing herself as the woman on the album cover and describing the album's sound. She resurfaces on interludes at the end of some songs, providing information and adding to the overall aesthetic of the album. Q-Tip explained the decision to use her voice: \"Everybody was used to hearing that kind of voice whether they were calling a phone company or they were on hold. There was always some type of monotone female voice that had a computerized vibe that was giving you information. So I thought how cool would it be if you called to pay your bill and then you would hear this female voice start rattling shit off like, 'Keep bouncing?'\"Midnight Marauders--A Tribe Called Quest (1993) Vibe. Accessed on January 9, 2018. Despite Jarobi White leaving the group midway through recording The Low End Theory, the group maintained a \"revolving door policy\" with him, in which he would continue to attend recording sessions and supply the group with humor that became part of their songwriting process. Clarifying his role, he stated, \"You come in [to the studio]. You might have had a bad day today. Some lady might have pushed you on the train ... I walk in the studio and I'm bringing all my rambunctious silly stupid jokes and now we're all laughing.\" Because of his efforts, White is referenced on Midnight Marauders. ==Music== ===Production=== The production on Midnight Marauders is a return to the eclectic sampling that the group was originally known for, featuring samples of mainly 1970s jazz, funk, soul and R&B.;A Tribe Called Quest\u2019s \u201cMidnight Marauders\u201d Just Turned 24 \u2014 Here\u2019s a 18-Track Playlist To Celebrate Medium. Accessed on January 9, 2018. The sound is noticeably grittier and funkier than The Low End Theory, with John Bush of AllMusic noting that the group \"moved closer to their harder contemporaries\" and praising them for producing \"the most inviting grooves heard on any early-'90s rap record.\"Bush, John. A Tribe Called Quest - Biography by John Bush. AllMusic. Accessed on January 9, 2018. The album has been described as \"hooky\" and was given critical praise for its frequent horn hooks. Q-Tip implemented his drum layering technique to great effect on the album, varying the drum frequencies on each song.Q-Tip Red Bull Music Academy. Accessed on January 9, 2018. Describing the album's drum programming to Vibe, Q-Tip said: Q-Tip also experimented with vocal sampling techniques on the album. For the song \"Lyrics to Go\", he sampled a portion of \"Inside My Love\" by Minnie Riperton, in which Riperton's whistle register is sustained throughout, giving \"Lyrics to Go\" a droning backdrop. The song \"Sucka Nigga\" contains a slowed-down sample of Rodney Cee's voice, taken from \"M.C. Battle\" with Busy Bee, which was featured in the old school hip hop film Wild Style (1983). While DJing at a party, Q-Tip played Jade's hit \"Don't Walk Away\"; noting the positive crowd reaction when the song's bassline began playing, he was inspired to sample the bassline for the album's lead single, \"Award Tour\".Jade\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Walk Away\u201d Inspired Q-Tip to Make \u201cAward Tour\u201d Medium. Accessed on January 9, 2018. For The Low End Theory, engineer Bob Power removed all excess noise from the samples, however, Q-Tip instructed him to leave the noise in the samples on Midnight Marauders, adding to the gritty nature of the album.Interview: Bob Power on D'Angelo, Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul Red Bull Music Academy. Accessed on January 9, 2018. In addition, Q-Tip has stated that the album has more \"sheen\" to it than The Low End Theory, having been recorded on an SSL mixing console rather than the Neve console they previously used. ===Lyrics=== The lyricism on Midnight Marauders is often regarded as the best on any A Tribe Called Quest album, and the group's biggest improvement since their debut People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm. The group's documentary director Michael Rapaport stated, \"They followed a classic and upped the ante. Put it like this: [The Low End Theory] would be the first run at the championship ring, but it takes a different mentality to stay focused and do it again.\" Subject matter on the album includes social issues, use of the word nigger and everyday life, as well as several sports references. Building on the lyrical interplay that was established on The Low End Theory, Q-Tip and Phife Dawg are \"practically telepathic\" on some songs, providing a contrast in both delivery and style. AllMusic's John Bush described this contrast as \"focused yet funky\" and \"polished but raw.\" All aspects of the group's lyricism improved on the album, including cadence, flow, diction and use of metaphors. The song \"8 Million Stories\" finds Phife Dawg storytelling, as he details \"a laundry-list of mundane annoyances.\" On the single \"Oh My God\", he refers to himself as a \"funky diabetic\" in a moment of self-deprecation. Throughout the album, the group blends their brand of intelligence, reflection and positivity with humorous anecdotes. James Bernard of Entertainment Weekly praised the group for managing to \"hold our attention without resorting to gun references or expletives.\" Tom Breihan of Stereogum noted that Q-Tip and Phife Dawg \"sounded slicker and more comfortable than they ever had before.\" Owing to that comfort and their chemistry, the two occasionally performed each others's lyrics during the recording sessions. Describing the \"Electric Relaxation\" session to XXL, Phife Dawg said, \"On that record, [Q-Tip] wrote my lines and I wrote his\u2014actually, we wrote our own lines, and when we recorded, we traded. That's why the whole back and forth, you know what I mean?\" ==Cover artwork== The back vinyl cover of Midnight Marauders The album cover artwork depicts a woman painted in Afrocentric colors, continuing the artistic theme found on The Low End Theory. According to Ego Trip's Book of Rap Lists, there are a reported 71 different hip hop luminaries and radio DJs who adorned Midnight Marauders.

In his consumer guide for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau gave the album an A\u2212 rating and noted that the double bass sounds of The Low End Theory \"rock the house, literally\" on Midnight Marauders, which \"never contents itself with concept.\" Colson Whitehead of Spin praised Q-Tip and Phife Dawg for \"complementing each other's styles perfectly\" and lauded the album's \"smooth textures that bubble up from unseen, mellow depths.\" In a negative review, Glenn Kenny of Rolling Stone felt that the \"lively wit\" of the group's previous work had been \"replaced with tired boasts\", also stating, \"The music still has its beguiling moments, but nothing approaches the revelatory jazz stylings and laid-back cool of past work.\" ===Retrospect=== John Bush of AllMusic praised the album for being \"impeccably produced\", \"artistically adept\" and \"lyrically inventive.\" Bush also stated that it cemented the group's status as \"alternative rap's prime sound merchants\" and hailed them as \"authors of the most original style since the Bomb Squad first exploded on wax.\" In Oliver Wang's book Classic Material: The Hip-Hop Album Guide, writer Joseph Patel noted how the album helped unify hip hop in the early 1990s: Writing in The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, Mac Randall wrote that it \"certainly doesn't skimp on the funk.\" For About.com's 10 Essential Hip-Hop Albums, where the album was ranked seventh, writer Henry Adaso declared, \"No other album showcased this amalgamation of jazz, soul, and rap better.\" Steve Juon of RapReviews.com lauded its \"unparalleled level\" of \"lyrical brilliance by both Tip and Phife.\" It was ranked number 75 on Pitchforks list of the Top 100 Favorite Records of the 1990s, with Rollie Pemberton stating that the group \"produced a jazz-hop clinic that finds itself equal parts Pete Rock, Buckshot and Diamond D.\" === Accolades === Since its release, Midnight Marauders has been included on several \"best of\" lists compiled by music writers and journalists.

Q: 142. March 1997.. Accessed on January 11, 2018. In a conversation with NME, producer Mark Ronson said that the album \"changed the sound of East Coast hip-hop, which before was very noisy and aggressive. But Midnight Marauders just had this sheen to it \u2014 it wasn't too cleaned-up or sanitised, the snares still had that amazing 'crack' to them, but it sounded like nothing you'd ever heard before. It changed everything.\" In 2003, Pitchfork writer Rollie Pemberton stated that \"a deep listen to this record unveils the sound that helped promote the current chilled vibe-oriented underground\", citing the J Dilla-produced duo Frank n Dank, Madlib and 9th Wonder's former group Little Brother as examples. Other underground artists influenced by the album include Terrace Martin, Jean Grae, Currensy, RJD2, Oddisee, Hiatus Kaiyote and Karriem Riggins. In a 20th anniversary review of the album for XXL, rapper Talib Kweli gave it a perfect \"XXL\" rating and stated, \"It established Tribe as a commercial, mainstream almost pop group, but it did it by being completely true to their rudiments, and it did it by finding the greatest jazz samples and making the most classic underground hip-hop they could make. They were so good at making underground hip-hop that it went pop.\" The singer Bilal names it among his 25 favorite albums, explaining that, \"It's just a special album to me. I like where they were as far as beat making. I think it changed a lot in hip-hop on that record.\" ==Track listing== *All songs produced by A Tribe Called Quest, except track 4 produced by Skeff Anselm and track 11 produced by Large Professor. == Personnel == Credits are adapted from AllMusic. *Skeff Anselm \u2013 producer *Busta Rhymes \u2013 guest artist *Pete Christensen \u2013 assistant engineer *Tom Coyne \u2013 mastering *Patrick Derivaz \u2013 assistant engineer *Chris Flam \u2013 assistant engineer *Eric Gast \u2013 assistant engineer *Gerard Julien \u2013 assistant engineer *Large Professor \u2013 guest artist, producer *Tim Latham \u2013 engineer *Hoover Le \u2013 assistant engineer *Ali Shaheed Muhammad \u2013 DJ *Phife Dawg \u2013 vocals *Bob Power \u2013 engineer, mixing *Q-Tip \u2013 vocals *Brad Schmidt \u2013 assistant engineer *George Spatta \u2013 assistant engineer *A Tribe Called Quest \u2013 engineer, mixing, primary artist, producer *Trugoy the Dove \u2013 guest artist *Carol Weinberg \u2013 photography *Raphael Wiggins \u2013 guest artist, bass guitar ==Charts and certifications== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1993) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1994) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums (Billboard) | 24 |} ===Certifications=== ==See also== *List of number-one R&B; albums of 1993 (U.S.) *List of hip hop albums considered to be influential == Bibliography == * * ==References== ==External links== * Category:1993 albums Category:A Tribe Called Quest albums Category:Albums produced by Large Professor Category:Albums produced by Q-Tip (musician) Category:Jive Records albums ",
