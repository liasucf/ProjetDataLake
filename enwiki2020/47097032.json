    "text": "The biblical Tamar poses as a harlot to seduce Judah (Horace Vernet, 1840) The oldest profession in the world (or the world's oldest profession) is a phrase that, unless another meaning is specified, refers to prostitution. However, it did not start to acquire that meaning until 1889, after a Rudyard Kipling story, and it did not do so universally until after World War I. Formerly, various professions vied for the reputation of being the oldest. ==Earlier senses== The claim to be the oldest profession was made on behalf of farmers,\"The farmer, therefore, can boast of being a member of the oldest profession\" (Annual Report of the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture, Michigan, 1878). cattle drovers,\"He reminded his audience that theirs was the very oldest profession in the world\" (Bury and Norwich Post, Suffolk, 19 June 1883, p.5. horticulturalists,\"\u2026 certainly we are representatives of the oldest profession of which we have any knowledge\" (Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Ohio State Horticultural Society, 1890, p.35. barbers,South Bucks Standard, 30 August 1895, p.5. engineers,\"\u2026 we belong to the oldest profession in the world\" (The Stevens indicator, vol. 9, 1892, p.167). landscape gardeners,\"I need hardly speak of its antiquity, the oldest profession in the world\" (Preston Chronicle, Lancashire, 9 November 1889, p.2.) the military,Speech by Lord Wolseley, Morning Post, 21 December 1895. doctors,The Clinic: A Weekly Journal of Practical Medicine, 1875, p.245. nurses,Nursing World, vols 21\u201322, 1898, p.123. teachers,The Ohio Educational Monthly, vol 57, 1908, p.294. priests,Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, 1902. lay preachersIslington Gazette, 29 April 1902, p.4. and even lawyers.\"A lawyer, then, is a member of the oldest profession extant; for as he lives upon the rottenness of human nature, the first human crime made room for a lawyer\" (Alfred Butler, Elphinstone, vol 1, 1841, p.189). Perhaps the earliest recorded claim to be the world's oldest profession was made on behalf of tailors. The Song in Praise of the Merchant-Taylors, attested from 1680, which was routinely performed at pageants at the Lord Mayor's Show, London, if the current mayor happened to belong to the tailors' guild,Percy Society, Early English Poetry, Ballads and Popular Literature of the Middle Ages, vol. XIX (London, 1846), p.74. began: Of all the professions that ever were nam'd, The taylor's, though slighted, is much to be fam'd': For various invention, and antiquity, No trade with the tayler's compar\u00e8d may be: After pointing out that Adam and Eve made garments for themselves, and were therefore tailors, it continued: Then judge if a tayler was not the first trade. The oldest profession, and they are but raylers,Bitter deriders or scoffers. Who scoff and deride men that be merchant-taylers. The Irish poet Henry Brooke (1701\u20131783) declared that humbugging (i.e. scamming) was the oldest profession:Samuel Johnson, The Works of English Poets, from Chaucer to Cowper, vol 17, p.428. Of all trades and arts in repute or possession, Humbugging is held the most ancient profession. The phrase had also been applied to murderers. In The Secret Societies of All Ages and Countries (1875),(London, Richard Bentley and Son), vol 2, p.324. Charles William Heckethorn, describing the Thugs of India, said: > The hierophant, on initiating the candidate, says to him: \"Thou hast chosen, > my son, the most ancient profession, the most acceptable to the deity. Thou > hast sworn to put to death every human being fate throws into thy hand...\" ==Association with prostitution== A Courtesan Unveiling, unknown Indian artist, 1800s (Wellcome Collection) The phrase began to be associated with prostitution in the last decade of the nineteenth century following Rudyard Kipling's short story about an Indian prostitute, On the City Wall (January 1889). Kipling, after citing a biblical reference,Joshua ii. 15. began: > Lalun is a member of the most ancient profession in the world. Lilith was > her very-great-grandmamma, and that was before the days of Eve as every one > knows. In the West, people say rude things about Lalun's profession, and > write lectures about it, and distribute the lectures to young persons in > order that Morality may be preserved. In the East where the profession is > hereditary, descending from mother to daughter, nobody writes lectures or > takes any notice; and that is a distinct proof of the inability of the East > to manage its own affairs. In a scathing article on the morals of the aristocracy in the mass circulation Reynold's Newspaper, 22 July 1894,Page 4. the reference was repeated: > In ancient Rome, under the empire, ladies used to go to baths to meet a > certain class of men, while men resorted thither to meet a certain class of > ladies. The ladies belonged to what has been called \u201cthe oldest profession > in the world\", a profession which is carried on in Piccadilly, Regent > street, and other parts of London with great energy every night \u2026 In the same year the Pall Mall Gazette12 November 1894, page 6. reported a speech in which \"Mrs. Ormiston Chant \u2026 implored us to stand shoulder to shoulder and destroy what Kipling has called 'the oldest profession in the world'\". The phrase was frequently used as a euphemism when delicacy forbade direct reference to prostitution. ==Residual usage of the phrase in its reputable sense== There is some evidence that unworldly speakers (e.g. of the older generation) or unsophisticated audiences (e.g. in small towns or rural areas) were not at first aware of the phrase's newly acquired meaning. Thus for some time the following could be said in English newspaper reports without apparent embarrassment: \u201cA certain proportion of the cadets were now leaving to enter the oldest profession in the world\u201d (1895).(The profession of arms.) Speech of Lord Wolseley to the Royal Military Academy, Morning Post, 21 December 1895, page 2. \u201cThis gentleman's name often figures high in local prize lists, and he is considered an enthusiast in 'the oldest profession in the world'\" (1902).(Gardener.) Folkestone, Hythe, Sandgate & Cheriton Herald, 17 May 1902, page 7. \u201cMr Petrie heard the voice of God and observed the working of His hand in ways that are denied to most of us. His speech, and especially his prayers, exhibited a rare consciousness of the beauty of holiness, and were fragrant with phrases of singular charm. As you all know, Mr Petrie followed the oldest profession in the world\u201d (1915).(Gardener). Stirling Observer, 12 November 1915, page 8. \"In conclusion, he [Lord Eustace Percy] reminded the teachers that they were the most ancient profession in the world, having descended from the Academy of Plato, and they must always remember that fact (1924).\"Surrey Mirror, 19 December 1924, p.6. However, those 'innocent' uses of the phrase tended to die out as awareness of the newly acquired meaning increased; as did the appreciation that antiquity, of itself, did not make a profession respectable. ==See also== * World's second oldest profession ==References== ==External links== Nominations for the second-oldest profession: Category:Prostitution Category:English phrases Category:Lists of English phrases Category:English-language idioms ",
