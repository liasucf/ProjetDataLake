    "text": "\"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\" is the second single by American singer- actress Cher from her second album, The Sonny Side of Ch\u00e9r. Written by her then-husband Sonny Bono and released in 1966, the song reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart and No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 for a single week (behind \"(You're My) Soul and Inspiration\" by The Righteous Brothers), eventually becoming one of Cher's biggest-selling singles of the 1960s. ==History== The single proved successful, charting high in several countries worldwide. It became Cher's first million-selling single and her first top 3 hit in the UK (and her last until \"The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)\" reached No. 1 in 1991). Critic Tim Sendra, in his album review of The Sonny Side of Cher, gave the song a mixed review: \"The only track that has any real zest is the Bono- written novelty 'Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down),' the kind of dramatic song Cher could knock out in her sleep but also a song with no real heart.\" On the other hand, the reviewer for Cashbox said the song was \"inventive,\" and predicted it would become a \"blockbuster\" hit. The reviewer praised its \"plaintive, blues-soaked\" style, as well as the \"interesting Gypsy-ish backing.\" \"Record Reviews,\" Cashbox, March 5, 1966, p. 16. In 1987, Cher recorded a rock version of the song for her 1987 Platinum-certified comeback album Cher. Produced by Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, and Desmond Child, the song featured backing vocals by Jon Bon Jovi and Michael Bolton, among others, and was released as a promotional single in 1988. Cher performed this version on her Heart of Stone Tour and on Living Proof: The Farewell Tour, and it was played instrumentally on the Dressed to Kill Tour in 2014. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !Chart (1966) !Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (Kent Music Report)David Kent Australian Chart Book 1940-1969 | 11 |- |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"| Italian Singles (FIMI) | 8 |- !scope=\"row\"|Japanese Singleshttp://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive- Cash-Box-IDX/60s/1966/CB-1966-08-27-OCR-Page-0070.pdf | 5 |- |- !scope=\"row\"|New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ)Scapolo, Dean (2007).

Her version features tremolo guitar, played by her arranger, Billy Strange, and had a resurgence in popularity when it was used in the opening credits of the 2003 Quentin Tarantino film Kill Bill Volume 1. In the sequence preceding the credits, Tarantino creates a literal, bloody interpretation of the song's chorus and the third verse, about a wedding day. Her version also was the theme for BBC coverage of the 2005 Wimbledon tennis championships, and has been sampled on several hip-hop recordings, including the Audio Bullys (featuring Nancy Sinatra) top 3 UK hit \"Shot You Down\" in 2005. ===Dalida=== The song was also very popular in Italy in 1966 when it was covered in Italian by Dalida. The song reached #1 and stayed for 2 months winning her a gold record. Following her recording, several Italian singers including Mina, and the psychedelic bands Equipe 84 and I Corvi covered her version. Her version was also included as main song of 2010 drama film Heartbeats. Besides Dalida and Sinatra, artists who covered the song in 1966 include Stevie Wonder on his album Down to Earth, The Beau Brummels on Beau Brummels '66; Petula Clark on her album I Couldn't Live Without Your Love; and G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3 on his album Spellbinder.
