    "text": "The reprojection error is a geometric error corresponding to the image distance between a projected point and a measured one. It is used to quantify how closely an estimate of a 3D point \\hat{\\mathbf{X}} recreates the point's true projection \\mathbf{x}. More precisely, let \\mathbf{P} be the projection matrix of a camera and \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} be the image projection of \\hat{\\mathbf{X}}, i.e. \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{P} \\, \\hat{\\mathbf{X}}. The reprojection error of \\hat{\\mathbf{X}} is given by d(\\mathbf{x}, \\, \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}), where d(\\mathbf{x}, \\, \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) denotes the Euclidean distance between the image points represented by vectors \\mathbf{x} and \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}. Minimizing the reprojection error can be used for estimating the error from point correspondences between two images. Suppose we are given 2D to 2D point imperfect correspondences \\\\{\\mathbf{x_i} \\leftrightarrow \\mathbf{x_i}'\\\\}. We wish to find a homography \\hat{\\mathbf{H}} and pairs of perfectly matched points \\hat{\\mathbf{x_i}} and \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_i', i.e. points that satisfy \\hat{\\mathbf{x_i}}' = \\hat{H}\\mathbf{\\hat{x}_i} that minimize the reprojection error function given by : \\sum_i d(\\mathbf{x_i}, \\hat{\\mathbf{x_i}})^2 + d(\\mathbf{x_i}', \\hat{\\mathbf{x_i}}')^2 So the correspondences can be interpreted as imperfect images of a world point and the reprojection error quantifies their deviation from the true image projections \\hat{\\mathbf{x_i}}, \\hat{\\mathbf{x_i}}' ==References== * Category:Geometry in computer vision ",
