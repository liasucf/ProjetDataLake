    "text": "The Gibraltar Parliament is the legislature of the British overseas territory of Gibraltar. Between 1969 and 2006, it was called the Gibraltar House of Assembly. ==Functions== The House of Assembly, set up under the 1969 constitution, was a unicameral body originally consisting of 15 members elected by the Gibraltar electorate, plus two appointed members including the Attorney-General. The term \"House of Assembly\" has been commonly used for the legislatures of British territories that are less than fully sovereign. It was replaced by the current Gibraltar Parliament by the new 2006 constitution, reflecting an increase in its sovereignty. All 17 of the new Parliament's members are elected. Under the election system, each voter was allowed to vote for ten members of the Assembly. Due to the small area of Gibraltar and its territorial continuity, precincts served only as polling places, not political units, and there are no electoral districts served by the members, who were instead elected \"at large\" to serve the territory as a whole. The system lends itself to block votingeach of the parties or electoral coalitions tended to nominate a slate of ten candidates and encourage its supporters to vote for all of them. In most cases, the winning party or coalition would have all ten of its nominees elected, with the other seven elected members coming from the second-place party. ==Parliament building== Chamber of the Parliament The Parliament sits in a building overlooking Main Street and John Mackintosh Square. It was constructed in 1817 and previously served as the Exchange and Commercial Library. In 1951, the building was refurbished to host the Legislative Council. Under the 1969 Constitution, the House of Assembly was established, superseding the Legislative Council. The first session of the House of Assembly was opened on 28 August 1969 by the then Governor, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Varyl Begg. ==Current membership== The 17 Members of the Gibraltar Parliament, as of the most recent election, are: {| class=wikitable !colspan=2|Candidate !Party |- |style=\"background-color: \" | |Paul Balban||GSLP |- |style=\"background-color: \" | |Joseph Bossano||GSLP |- |style=\"background-color: \" | |John Cortes||GSLP |- |style=\"background-color: \" | |Albert Isola||GSLP |- |style=\"background-color: \" | |Gilbert Licudi||GSLP |- |style=\"background-color: \" | |Fabian Picardo||GSLP |- |style=\"background- color: \" | |Samantha Sacramento||GSLP |- |style=\"background-color: \" | |Vijay Daryanani||LPG |- |style=\"background-color: \" | |Joseph Garcia||LPG |- |style=\"background-color: \" | |Steven Linares||LPG |- |style=\"background- color: \" | | Keith Azopardi || GSD |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | Damon Bossino || GSD |- |style=\"background-color: \" | |Roy Clinton || GSD |- |style=\"background-color: \" | |Daniel Feetham||GSD |- |style=\"background- color: \" | |Elliott Phillips|| GSD |- |style=\"background-color: \" | |Edwin Reyes||GSD |- |style=\"background-color: \" | |Marlene Hassan Nahon|| TG |- |} ==Latest election== Summary of the 17 October 2019 Gibraltar Parliament election results {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right !colspan=4|Party !Votes !% !+/\u2013 !Seats !% !+/\u2013 |- | rowspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"\" | | colspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:left;\" rowspan=\"3\"|Alliance | bgcolor=\"\" | |align=left|Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party||58,576||37.00||-10.8||7||41.2||\u00b10 |- | bgcolor=\"\" | |align=left|Liberal Party of Gibraltar||24,546||15.50||-5.1||3||17.6||\u00b10 |- | rowspan=\"1\" bgcolor=\"\" | |align=left bgcolor=#efefef colspan=1|Total Alliance||align=right bgcolor=#efefef colspan=1|83,122||align=right bgcolor=#efefef colspan=1|52.50||align=right bgcolor=#efefef colspan=1|-15.9||align=right bgcolor=#efefef colspan=1|10||align=right bgcolor=#efefef colspan=1|58.8||align=right bgcolor=#efefef colspan=1|\u00b10 |- | bgcolor=\"\" | | colspan=\"3\" align=left|Gibraltar Social Democrats||40,453||25.55||-6.0||6||35.3||-1 |- | bgcolor=\"\" | | colspan=\"3\" align=left|Together Gibraltar||32,455||20.50||+20.5||1||5.9||+1 |- | bgcolor=\"\" | | colspan=\"3\" align=left|Independents||2,298||1.45||+1.4||0||0.0||\u00b10 |- |align=left bgcolor=#efefef colspan=4|Total||align=right bgcolor=#efefef colspan=1|158,328||align=right bgcolor=#efefef colspan=1|100||align=right bgcolor=#efefef colspan=1|-||align=right bgcolor=#efefef colspan=1|17||align=right bgcolor=#efefef colspan=1|100||align=right bgcolor=#efefef colspan=1|- |- !colspan=10| |- |align=left colspan=4|Valid votes|| 16,767 || 97.85||colspan=4 rowspan=4 bgcolor=#F4F4F4| |- |align=left colspan=4|Invalid/blank votes|| 368|| 2.15 |- |align=left colspan=4|Total votes cast||17,135||100 |- |align=left colspan=4|Registered voters/turnout||24,189 ||70.84 |- |align=left colspan=10|Source: Parliament of Gibraltar, Gibraltar Parliament General Election, Registered |} ==See also== * Gibraltar Constitution Order 2006 * 2006 Gibraltarian constitutional referendum * Speaker of the Gibraltar Parliament ==References== ==External links== * Parliament Parliament Category:Legislatures of British Overseas Territories Category:1969 establishments in Gibraltar Category:2006 establishments in Gibraltar Category:Parliaments by country Gibraltar ",
