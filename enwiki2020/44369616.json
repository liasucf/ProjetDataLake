The host of ATCV-1 is Chlorella heliozoae; it was demonstrated that \"ATCV-1 neither attaches to nor infects\" Chlorella variabilis. ==Human infection== DNA from ATCV-1 has been isolated from the mucous membranes of the noses of humans. In both humans and mice, the presence of ATCV-1 on the oropharyngeal mucosa was associated with lower scores in tests of cognitive and motor skills. Injection of purified algal virus ATCV-1 intracranially results in long-lasting cognitive and behavioural effects in mice via induction of inflammatory factors. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses Category:Phycodnaviridae ",
