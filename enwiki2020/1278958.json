Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine. In 2008, Cleveland Clinic became the first healthcare provider in the United States to become a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact and the second in the world. == History == ===Beginnings=== The organization grew out of the surgical practice of Frank J. Weed (died 1891) at 16 Church Street on the near-west side of Cleveland.English, Peter C. (1980). Shock, Physiological Surgery and George Crile. Greenwood Press, p. 62. The practice was purchased by his two assistants, Frank E. Bunts and George Washington Crile. In 1892 they were joined by Crile's cousin, William E. Lower, and in 1897 the practice moved to the Osborn Building on Prospect Avenue, downtown Cleveland. A four-story outpatient building was constructed, and Cleveland Clinic was dedicated at a private ceremony on February 26, 1921.Retrieved from http://blog.cleveland.com/medical/2008/09/07CGCLINICTIME.pdf, August 26, 2015 It opened its doors two days later to the public and registered 42 patients.Clifton, Brad and Carmosino, Jessica (April 10, 2013). \"Creating Cleveland Clinic\". Center for Public History and Digital Humanities, Cleveland State University. By April 1921, it had 60 employees, including 14 physicians and four nurses. In 1922 the founders purchased four private homes nearby for hospitalization, radiation treatment, and administration.Rowland, Amy; Feather (1938). The Cleveland Clinic Foundation. A fifth house was acquired as a residence for patients with diabetes receiving insulin treatments. To meet rising patient volume, a 184-bed hospital was built in 1924, located at East 90th Street and Carnegie Avenue. A power plant, laundry, and ice plant were also built.Sheldon, William C. (2008). Pathfinders of the Heart, the History of Cardiology at Cleveland Clinic. Xlibris, p. 60. A research laboratory was constructed in 1928.Rose, William Ganson (1950). Cleveland: The Making of a City. Kent State University Press, p. 1011. ===Cleveland Clinic fire=== Cleveland Clinic's original building, built in 1921 On May 15, 1929, nitrocellulose x-ray films stored in the basement of the outpatient building ignited.Brown, Gary. \"The Monday After: X-ray films burn noxious fumes at Cleveland Clinic\". CantonRep.com, July 14, 2014.Bellamy, John Stark II (1995). They Died Crawling: And other Tales of Cleveland Woe. Cleveland: Gray & Company, 218\u2013232.Time Magazine, May 27, 1929, 15\u201316. An explosion sent a cloud of toxic oxides of nitrogen and carbon though the building. One hundred and twenty-three people lost their lives, including John Phillips, one of the founders. A dozen investigating agencies were not able to determine what had caused the fire. Cleveland Clinic's own inquiry narrowed the possible causes down to spontaneous combustion caused by heat; a discarded cigarette or match; and contact with an extension cord light hung over a stack of films. Philanthropist Samuel Mather formed a committee of 36 community leaders to help Cleveland Clinic reestablish itself in temporary quarters across the street.Plain Dealer123 Die in Clinic Disaster; Poison Gas Seeps into System; Explosion Rocks Building, August 23, 1998Reading Times, May 17, 1929, p2 Patient care services resumed five days later. The 1921 building was completely renovated, and a new three-story clinic building, with a new main entrance, was added in 1931. All debts were repaid by 1941.Profiles in Performance: Business Intelligence Journeys and the Roadmap for Change, Howard Dresner, Wiley & Sons, 2010, p. 57 ===Growth of specialization=== George Washington Crile, one of the founders Cleveland Clinic built new operating rooms in the early 1970s to accommodate the growth of cardiac surgery. The Martha Holden Jennings Education Building opened in 1964, with an auditorium named for Dr. Bunts. A new hospital building (currently home to Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital) opened in 1966, and a research building opened in 1974 (demolished in 2007). A pathology and laboratory medicine building was constructed on Carnegie Avenue in 1980.Porter, Michael; Teisberg, Elizabeth (2014). Cleveland Clinic: Growth Strategy 2014. Harvard Business School, pp. 4\u20135. Willian S. Kiser, chairman of the board 1977\u20131989, led the development of a strategic plan to accommodate growing patient volumes in the late 1970s. This resulted in a group of buildings known as the Century Project. Completed in 1985, the Century Project includes a 14-story outpatient building (now known as the Crile Building) designed by architect Cesar Pelli.retrieved from http://pcparch.com/project/crile-clinic, on August 26, 2015 == Research and education == The Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute (LRI) conducts biomedical research in a 480,000-square-foot building that opened in 1999, following a $16 million donation from Al and Norma Lerner in 1997, the largest single charitable donation made to the Cleveland Clinic up until that point. LRI hosts graduate student research through joint PhD programs in conjunction with nearby universities, including Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland State University (including an NIH-funded PhD program for minority and underrepresented students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), Kent State University and the University of Akron. In 2002, the Lerners eclipsed their previous gift and made a $100 million donation to establish the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine (CCLCM) of Case Western Reserve University, which opened in 2004. Physician researcher Eric Topol played an important role in securing the donation from the Lerner family. Topol served as Provost and Chief Academic Officer at CCLCM until 2006, when his position was eliminated amid controversy regarding his criticism of Vioxx and disagreements with other Cleveland Clinic leaders, including then-CEO Toby Cosgrove. CCLCM is a five-year medical school program affiliated with the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine with 32 students per class, each receiving a scholarship for full tuition and fees. While traditional MD-granting medical schools in the U.S. are four-year programs, the extra year in the program is dedicated to a year of research. The curriculum is notable for its lack of class rank, pre-clinical or clinical grading, or end-of-course examinations. In 2019, Cleveland Clinic and Case Western opened the Samson Pavilion Health Education Campus on the campus of the Cleveland Clinic, a $515 million building project, amid a multi-million dollar joint fundraising campaign between CWRU and the Cleveland Clinic. The campus houses students Case Western Reserve School of Medicine (CCLCM and traditional MD programs), Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing and Case School of Dental Medicine, all of which\u2014with the exception of CCLCM\u2014had previously held classes on the campus of CWRU and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. The move, announced in 2013, was a major contributing factor for University Hospitals to shift its name from University Hospitals Case Medical Center to University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center in 2016, as well as renegotiate its affiliation agreement with CWRU that same year. Cleveland Clinic publishes the peer-reviewed Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine monthly, focusing on internal medicine, endocrinology, and diabetes. == Reputation == Cleveland Clinic is consistently regarded as one of the top hospital systems in the United States and in the world, and it is well regarded particularly in technological management systems. === Rankings === In 2020\u20132021, Cleveland Clinic was ranked as the #2 overall hospital in the United States by the U.S. News & World Report, behind the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.https://health.usnews.com/health-care/best- hospitals/articles/best-hospitals-honor-roll-and-overview A total of 4,656 hospitals were considered in 12 main data-driven medical and surgical specialty areas and four additional specialty areas, collating data on patient safety, performance measures, and complication rates.

Between 2010 and 2013, CMS undertook an extensive series of investigations into the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, with at least a dozen inspections and follow-up visits triggered by patient complaints. An analysis of Medicare inspection data between 2011 and 2014 found that the Cleveland Clinic Foundation was one of at least 230 instances in which validated serious incidents\u2014dubbed \"immediate jeopardy\" complaints\u2014led CMS to threaten loss of ability to serve Medicare patients unless the problems were fixed immediately. Due to numerous serious ongoing safety violations, the Cleveland Clinic Foundation was on payment termination track for 19 months, placing at stake $1B in annual Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement. The citations were reported and analyzed in detail by Modern Healthcare, which posted some of the safety documents. In its 2020 Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings, CMS gave a five- star rating to the Cleveland Clinic, as well as several community hospitals in the Cleveland Clinic system, including Fairview Hospital, Hillcrest Hospital, and Lutheran Hospital. In these ratings, Cleveland Clinic Martin North Hospital received a one-star rating. During the COVID-19 pandemic, administration at the Cleveland Clinic initially instructed physicians that they were not allowed to wear face masks outside of patient care areas. The Cleveland Clinic stated this made this decision as they felt the evidence did not support them. Other hospitals however require such masks. Later, the policies were revised, and all staff members were required to wear cloth or protective masks. Masks were obtained from a variety of sources, including Amish and sports apparel manufacturers, among other suppliers. == Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital == Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital (CCCH) is a pediatric acute care children's teaching hospital located in Cleveland, Ohio on the main campus of Cleveland Clinic.
