    "text": "Rambouillet (, , ) is a commune in the Yvelines department in the \u00cele-de- France region of France. It is located on the outskirts of Paris, southwest from the centre. Rambouillet is a sub-prefecture of the department. Rambouillet lies on the edge of the vast Forest of Rambouillet (For\u00eat de Rambouillet or For\u00eat de l'Yveline), and is famous for its historical castle, the Ch\u00e2teau de Rambouillet, which hosted several international summits. Due to its proximity to Paris and Versailles, Rambouillet has long been an occasional seat of government. ==Transport== Rambouillet is served by the SNCF Rambouillet railway station on the Transilien Paris - Montparnasse suburban rail line to Chartres. ==Features== *The Ch\u00e2teau de Rambouillet, a former medieval fortress, was acquired by Louis XVI of France in 1783 as a private residence because of its ideal situation in the game-rich forest of Rambouillet. It became a bien national during the French Revolution of 1789, and one of the imperial residences of Napol\u00e9on I during the First French Empire. At the time of the Bourbon Restoration, the castle became royal residence, and it is there that Charles X signed his abdication on 2 August 1830. Sometimes neglected at times of political unrest, the ch\u00e2teau de Rambouillet became the official summer residence of the French President of the Republic after President F\u00e9lix Faure chose it as summer residence for himself and his family in 1896; Rambouillet thus became the official summer residence of the Presidents of the Third Republic and has retained its position ever since.G. Lenotre, Le ch\u00e2teau de Rambouillet : six si\u00e8cles d'histoire, \u00c9ditions Calmann-L\u00e9vy, collection \u00ab Ch\u00e2teaux : d\u00e9cors de l'histoire \u00bb, Paris, 1930. *The Palais du Roi de Rome. In 1784, on a parcel adjacent to the gardens of the castle, Louis XVI had ordered the construction of the H\u00f4tel du Gouvernement, which was restored during the reign of Napol\u00e9on I, and renamed Palais du Roi de Rome as the official Rambouillet residence of Napoleon's infant son. Its entrance is situated in the rue Charles de Gaulle, Rambouillet's main street. *The H\u00f4tel de Ville, the former Bailliage (Bailiwicks building) was built in 1786 at the request of Louis XVI by the architect Jacques-Jean Th\u00e9venin. It was given by Napol\u00e9on I to the inhabitants of Rambouillet to serve as their City Hall. The inscription over the doors of the City Hall reads \"Donated to the inhabitants of Rambouillet by Napoleon the Great, [in the] Year 1809\". *The new Saint-Lubin church was built between 1868 and 1871. Its architect was Anatole de Baudot, a student of Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le- Duc. *The Bergerie nationale was built on the grounds of the Domain of Rambouillet at the request of Louis XVI, and is the home of the Rambouillet Merino sheep since 1786. *The Laiterie de la Reine, the Queen's Dairy also built on the grounds of the Domain of Rambouillet, is adjacent to the Bergerie. It was built in 1787 at the request of Louis XVI for his wife Marie Antoinette and designed by the architect Jean-Jacques Th\u00e9venin. *The Chaumi\u00e8re des coquillages, a thatched-roof cottage with its marble interior decorated with shells and mother of pearl, was built in 1779-1780 in the English garden of the Domain of Rambouillet by Claude-Martin Goupy, the architect of the duc de Penthi\u00e8vre, for the princesse de Lamballe, Penthi\u00e8vre's widowed daughter- in-law. *The Mus\u00e9e Rambolitrain, situated across from the Saint-Lubin church, is a museum featuring miniature trains. We find a faithful reconstruction of a Parisian toy store of the 1930s. *The Monument Am\u00e9ricain (The American Eagle Monument), is situated at the south entrance of the town on the D 906 road to Chartres, at the site of two ambushes in which seven American soldiers were killed, on 16 August 1944. The monument was erected in 1947. It bears the inscription: \"\u00c0 la m\u00e9moire des soldats am\u00e9ricains tomb\u00e9s pour la lib\u00e9ration de notre r\u00e9gion en ao\u00fbt 1944\", \"In memory of the American soldiers fallen for the liberation of our region in August 1944\". The names of nine American soldiers are inscribed on a plaque on the monument. Commemorative ceremonies are held at the monument every 19 August.
