When cooked, sole meuni\u00e8re has a light but moist texture and a mild flavor. Since sole is a flatfish, a single fish will yield four filets rather than the two filets that a roundfish will produce. When preparing sole meuni\u00e8re, a true Dover sole is preferred. In classic service, the whole sole is first saut\u00e9ed in butter. Then, when cooking is finished, the fish is boned and plated by the waiter tableside. ==See also== *Meuni\u00e8re sauce *Fish and chips, the typical fried dish from English cuisine Category:Fish dishes Category:French cuisine ja:\u30e0\u30cb\u30a8\u30eb ",
