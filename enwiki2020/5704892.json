His concert career began in 1978 and brought him to about 40 countries all over the world. Invitations to international music festivals in Europe and overseas, as well as to the Royal Academy of Music (London), the Manhattan School of Music (New York) and the University of Southern California (Los Angeles), have been further highlights of his multifaceted career. 2003 - 2005 he was invited to teach as a guest professor at the Music University in Pite\u00e5 (Sweden). He has made several radio, television and commercial recordings, both solo and with other musicians including the pianist Alexis Weissenberg, tenor Christoph Pr\u00e9gardien, cellist Peter Wolf and the Rubio String Quartet. He also publishes music, including songs by Schubert, modern works written specially for him (Karl-Wieland Kurz's I giardini del sogno,Karl-Wieland Kurz: I giardini del sogno (info) for example), his own compositions and arrangements of music from the Baroque period. Besides his career as a recitalist, Hoppstock teaches international guitar classes at the Akademie f\u00fcr Tonkunst Darmstadt (Academy of Music at Darmstadt, Germany). In 2013 Tilman Hoppstock has received the \u201dDarmstadt Music Award 2013\u201d for his livework as guitarist, teacher, musicologist and publisher. In 2014 he obtained one's doctorate with his dissertation about 'The Polyphony in Bach's Lute Fugues'.published in PRIM Musikverlag (PRIM 1750-PEE) == Reviews == * Hoppstock is an exceptional player, with a fine sense of style and unfailing sensitivity, and a technician of the first water; his tone is refined and beautifully nuanced, his delivery is clean and sure even in the passages where the utmost dexterity is called for, and his command of varied articulation is admirable Gramophone (2/1998)initials \"JD\" in the music magazine Grammophone (2/1998) about the CD \"Classic Guitar\" (SIGNUM X75-00) * A playful interchange of light and dark shades with endless worlds of sound full of passion and conscientiousness...Tilman Hoppstock belongs to those artists who make you forget the instrument. Alexis Weissenberg (Paris, 1992)Alexis Weissenberg in a letter to Tilman Hoppstock, which had been published in Booklet SIGNUM X41-00 * Tilman Hoppstock\u2018s perfect performance, his extreme sensibility and a broad range of timbres and nuances, but also this extraordinary articulation in his playing makes him to one of the greatest guitarists in our century. Les Cahiers de la Guitare (Paris, No. 66/1998)Danielle Ribouilault in music magazine \"Les Cahiers de la guitare\" No. 66/1998 * The work is quite an extraordinary achievement and emphasizes how Hoppstock\u2019s evolution through the years of interpreting Bach is of itself a fascinating aspect of his musicianship which deserves close attention. The quality of these recordings is first-class throughout and superbly well re-mastered, so there is none of the jarring technological dislocation that often afflicts compilations of tracks from various years. This is a recording which should be on every self- respecting guitarist\u2019s shelf, no doubt cheek-by-jowl with Hoppstock\u2019s published books on Bach.
