He was also the State Assemblyman for Kota Damansara in Selangor from 2008 to 2013. He is a former Chairman of INSAN and Social Research Institute. Mohd Nasir had left Malaysian People's Party (Parti Rakyat Malaysia; PRM) and led a dissent group to form the new PSM in 1998 after the controversy of Malaysian People's Socialist Party (Parti Sosialis Rakyat Malaysia; PSRM)'s name reversion to PRM by the party's congress and the new leadership of Syed Husin Ali elected in 1989. Mohd Nasir was arrested and detained without trial under the Internal Security Act 1960 (ISA) for 15 months at the Kamunting Detention Centre during Operation Lalang, a government-sponsored crackdown that saw the arrest of many people, including activists, intellectuals and opposition politicians in 1987. ==Election Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\" |+ Parliament of Malaysia Results only available from the 2004 election.
