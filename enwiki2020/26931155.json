It is within walking distance of the Castle Heights and Cheviot Hills neighborhoods. The station location is adjacent to I-10, just west of the three-way intersection of National, Palms and Exposition boulevards and perched on an embankment above National Boulevard. Access is provided by stairs and elevators at the east end of the station. Construction incorporated an existing steel bridge from the Air Line era and added a new concrete bridge, both immediately east of the station over the National/Palms intersection, as well as re-used an existing rail tunnel west of the station.Project alternatives ==History== The Palms original depot building from 1875 now at Heritage Square Museum. Station sign from The Palms train depot now in Heritage Square Museum Bay View was a stop on the Los Angeles and Independence Railroad. It was renamed The Palms in 1886.\" \"The local of this paper the other day had a look at the 'Palms,' an incipient town on the line of the S. P. road, some five miles from Santa Monica. It is no longer a misnomer as the proprietors have planted two large palms near the depot and some 160 plants on the various driveways.\" \u2014 Newspaper account quoted in Ingersoll's Century History, Santa Monica Bay Cities, page 353\" The Eastlake style Palms-Southern Pacific Railroad Depot building was situated approximately west of the present station location, on the south side of the tracks, and remained in active rail service until the closure of the Santa Monica Air Line in 1953. Used in many motion pictures, the building eventually fell into disrepair and abandonment, but was declared a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1963. A grassroots organization, S.O.S. (Save Our Station), moved it in February 1976 to the Heritage Square Museum grounds in the Montecito Heights community of the Arroyo Seco. It now serves as the museum's gift shop and visitor center.George Garrigues, Los Angeles's The Palms Neighborhood, Charleston:Arcadia Press (2009), page 26 ==Nomenclature== Originally slated to be renamed \"National/Palms\" on re- opening, it remains \"Palms\" as a result of a request by the Palms Neighborhood Council. The council's resolution stated that: :: > the Pacific Line Palms station was an important landmark on the west side of > the city, and the community that grew around it is one of the oldest on the > west side of Los Angeles. Our stakeholders feel the naming of the station is > not only an important branding opportunity for Palms, but an opportunity for > Los Angeles to reinstate a link to the history in one of its oldest and most > diverse communities.Palms station letter On April 25, 2013, the Metro board of directors voted in favor of \"Palms\" as the official name of the station.Steve Hymon, \"Board approves station names for Expo Line Phase 2,\" The Source, April 25, 2013 ==Bus connections== * Santa Monica Big Blue Bus: 5, 17 * Flixbus ==References== ==External links== * Metro.net: Metro Expo Line website * Metro.net: \"More to Explore, 7 New Expo Line Stations\" \u2014 opened 20 May 2016. *Metro Expo Line Construction Authority website \u2014 all projects. *Metro Rail Expo Corridor, Phase 2 Project Website \u2014 opened 20 May 2016. *Youtube.com: Location of old Palms Station \u2014 seen on time lapse video of pre\u2212upgraded section of line from near Robertson Boulevard northwest through Palms and Cheviot Hills to Pico Boulevard.
