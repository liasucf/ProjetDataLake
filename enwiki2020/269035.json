    "text": "penny The cent is a monetary unit of many national currencies that equals of the basic monetary unit. Etymologically, the word 'cent' derives from the Latin word meaning hundred. The cent sign is commonly a simple minuscule (lower case) letter . In North America, the c is crossed by a diagonal stroke or a vertical line (depending on typeface), yielding the character . The United States one cent coin is generally known by the nickname \"penny\", alluding to the British coin and unit of that name. Canada ended production of their 1\u00a2 coin in 2012. ==Symbol== The cent may be represented by the cent sign, written in various ways according to the national convention and font choice. Most commonly seen forms are a minuscule letter c crossed by a diagonal stroke or a vertical line, with a tick above and below, or by a simple c, depending on the currency (see below). Cent amounts from 1 to 99 can be represented as one or two digits followed by the appropriate abbreviation (2\u00a2, 5c, 75\u00a2, 99c), or as a subdivision of the base unit ($0.75, \u20ac0.99) In some countries, longer abbreviations like \"ct.\" are used. Languages that use other alphabets have their own abbreviations and conventions. ===North American cent sign=== The cent sign appeared as the shift of the 6 key on American manual typewriters, but that position has been taken over by the freestanding circumflex on computer keyboards. The character (offset 162) can still be created in most common code pages, including Unicode and Windows-1252: * On DOS- or Windows-based computers, is held while typing or on the numeric keypad.See Alt code for more information. If there is no numeric keypad, as on many laptops, is typed in Windows Wordpad followed by and copy/paste the resulting \u00a2 into the target document. For the US International keyboard c is typed (Windows). * On Macintosh systems, is held and on the number row is pressed. * On Unix/Linux systems with a compose key, and are typical sequences. ===Orthography=== When written in English, the cent sign (\u00a2 or c) follows the amount (with no space between)for example, 2\u00a2 and $0.02, or 2c and \u20ac0.02. Conventions in other languages may vary. ==Usage== Russian one- kopek coin ===Minor currency units called cent or similar names=== Examples of currencies around the world featuring centesimal () units called cent, or related words from the same root such as c\u00e9ntimo, cent\u00e9simo, centavo or sen, are: * Argentine peso (as centavo) * Aruban florin * Australian dollar * Barbadian dollar * Bahamian dollar * Belize dollar * Bermudian dollar * Bolivian boliviano (as centavo) * Brazilian real (as centavo) * Brunei dollar (as sen) * Canadian dollar * Cayman Islands dollar * Chilean peso (as centavo).
