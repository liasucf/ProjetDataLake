Calhoun II, the grandson of John C. Calhoun and brother of Patrick Calhoun, and his wife Lennie Adams, the daughter of Betsy Johnson of the Lakeport Plantation. The plantation came with 20 black laborers, and Calhoun brought 150 more from his family plantations in Alabama. By 1883, there were 260 black laborers. According to Frank Wilkeson, Calhoun made sure they were not in debt, and earning enough to live in relative comfort. In 1915, the plantation was listed for sale by the heirs of Joseph P. Alexander and advertised as \"a baronial estate at the price of a farm\", with \"5,000 acres, 34 good mules, residence and 40 tenant houses.\" In 1953, Jack Vaughan sued Carneal Warfield over the ownership of the plantation.VAUGHAN, v.
