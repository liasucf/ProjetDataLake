    "text": "James Maurice Daniels (August 26, 1924 - June 12, 2016) was a Canadian Oxford- educated physicist, inventor, author, and former university professor. He was a physics professor at the University of British Columbia, from 1953 to 1960, then a year as a visiting professor at Instituto de Fisica J.A. Balseiro in Bariloche, Argentina, before becoming a professor of Physics at the University of Toronto. He also served 5 years as Chairman of the department. He retired as Professor Emeritus in the late 1980s to live near Princeton, where he had been a visiting senior researcher in 1984-85. == Education == Daniels received his degrees from Jesus College, Oxford; a BA in 1948, an MA in 1949 and DPhil in 1952. == Awards and honors == * Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada * Fellow of the Institute of Physics (London) * Chartered Physicist (United Kingdom) * Guggenheim Guggenheim Fellowship (1978). * Alfred P. Sloan Fellow (1963) * ICI Research Fellow (1952) * Nuffield Research Fellow (1951) * Member of the Canadian Association of Physicists and the American Physical Society. He is the inventor in three US patents: Instrument to measure the polarization of a hyperpolarized substance Device to measure the polarization of a hyperpolarized resonant substance Means and apparatus for analysing and filtering polarized light and synthesizing a scene in filtered light He is the author of the book Oriented Nuclei \"Oriented Nuclei\" (Academic Press, 1965). He authored many scientific articles in areas such as nuclear orientation, and applications of Mossbauer spectroscopy to magnetic materials and minerals. For example: He specialized in low temperature physics and oriented spin of nuclei especially at low temperatures. He also researched Mossbauer spectra and their applications to crystallography. He was the PhD supervisor of several physicists who became university professors in Canada, including: Gilles Lamarche (UBC-phD, University of Ottawa), Marcel Leblanc (UBC-PhD, University of Ottawa), Denis Rancourt (Toronto-PhD, University of Ottawa), and Stephen Julian (Toronto-PhD, University of Toronto). He was also notable for his capability to design and implement experiments, and in many visiting professor positions, helped design and implement the equipment necessary. ==Later life== Dr. James Daniels died on June 12, 2016 in Summit, New Jersey. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1924 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Canadian inventors Category:Canadian physicists Category:Alumni of Jesus College, Oxford Category:University of British Columbia faculty Category:University of Toronto faculty Category:Canadian expatriates in the United Kingdom ",
