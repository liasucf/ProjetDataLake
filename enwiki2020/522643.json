Its founder, William \"Bill\" Esper, is often referred to as the best-known of Meisner's first generation teachers, and his most \"authentic protege\". The William Esper Studio was listed as one of The 25 Best Drama Schools for a Master of Fine Arts numerous times. ==Background== When Esper was a young man, he saw Eli Wallach and Maureen Stapleton in a touring production of The Rose Tattoo. As Esper later recounted: \"[I] was so struck by the acting ...[A]fter the play was over, I decided to go around the corner to get a cup of coffee so I could think about it some more. I walked into a little drugstore, and Eli was sitting there having a bite to eat...\" Esper talked to the actor, and Wallach told him he had studied at Sanford Meisner's Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre. After graduating Case Western Reserve University in his native Ohio, Esper moved to New York City and began studying with Meisner, who was famous for his repetition exercise.Backstage Magazine NY feature on Studio In 1962 Esper undertook training as a teacher and director with Meisner and proceeded to work closely with him for the next 15 years.
