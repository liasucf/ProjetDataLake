In 1982 at Abbey Road Studios, they recorded a cover of the Shangri-Las' song \"Past, Present and Future\". It peaked at #56 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1983. The same year their version of \"Terry\", originally by Twinkle, was released. The group split up soon thereafter, and Whalley concentrated on her career as an actress. ==References== ==External links== *Cindy & The Saffrons at Discogs Category:English vocal groups Category:English girl groups Category:Musical groups with year of establishment missing ",
