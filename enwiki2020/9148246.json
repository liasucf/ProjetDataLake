    "text": "Snakes and Ladders is the fourth album by Gerry Rafferty. It was released in 1980, following the success of his previous two albums, City to City and Night Owl. The album charted at No. 15 in the UK but only reached No. 61 in the US. The album was released on CD in 1998 [EMI 7 46609-2] but deleted soon after that, and it got reissued on CD on August 2012 as a 2-CD set with \"Sleepwalking.\" Some of the songs are available on compilation albums. Four of the songs, \"The Garden of England\", \"I was a Boy Scout\", \"Welcome to Hollywood\" and \"Bring it all Home\" were recorded at Beatles producer George Martin's AIR studio in Montserrat. All the songs were original Rafferty compositions, though one \u2013 \"Johnny's Song\" \u2013 was a remake of a song which had been previously released by his former band Stealers Wheel, and another \u2013 \"Didn't I\" \u2013 was a remake of a song from Rafferty's 1971 album Can I Have My Money Back?. ==Track listing== All tracks composed by Gerry Rafferty #\"The Royal Mile\" \u2013 3:48 #\"I Was a Boy Scout\" \u2013 4:15 #\"Welcome to Hollywood\" \u2013 5:17 #\"Wastin' Away\" \u2013 3:29 #\"Look at the Moon\" \u2013 2:18 #\"Bring It All Home\" \u2013 4:40 #\"The Garden of England\" \u2013 4:08 #\"Johnny's Song\" \u2013 3:25 #\"Didn't I\" \u2013 4:14 #\"Syncopatin Sandy\" \u2013 4:24 #\"Cafe Le Cabotin\" \u2013 4:51 #\"Don't Close the Door\" \u2013 3:45 ==Charts== Album {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (1980) !align=\"left\"|Position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) |align=\"center\"|31 |- |} ==Personnel== Adapted from Snakes and Ladders vinyl LP liner notes. *Gerry Rafferty \u2013 lead vocals (all tracks), backing vocals (track 9), acoustic guitar (tracks 1-3, 9, 11) *Mo Foster \u2013 bass guitar (tracks 1-3, 6, 7, 11, 12) *Pete Zorn \u2013 bass guitar (tracks 4, 8-10) *Ian Lynn \u2013 keyboards (tracks 1, 5, 8, 10, 11), synthesizers (tracks 3, 7) *Jerry Donahue \u2013 guitar (tracks 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11) *Richard Brunton \u2013 guitar (tracks 3, 6, 7, 11, 12) *Richard Harvey \u2013 penny whistle (track 1) *Bryn Haworth \u2013 slide guitar (tracks 2, 12) *Betsy Cook \u2013 backing vocals (track 9) *Liam Genockey \u2013 drums (tracks 1-4, 6-12) *Billy Livsey \u2013 piano (tracks 2, 3, 6, 11) , clavinet (track 3), mystery voice (track 3), polymoog (track 6), keyboards (track 7), pianica (track 11) *Wil Malone - string arrangement (tracks 5, 7, 10), clarinet arrangement (track 10) *Chris Mercer - brass arrangement (track 2) *Raphael Ravenscroft \u2013 saxophone (tracks 3, 6) *Frank Ricotti \u2013 percussion (tracks 1, 3, 4, 8, 11), congas (track 2), tambourine (track 9), woodblocks (track 10) *Pete Wingfield \u2013 organ (tracks 2, 6, 12), piano (track 12) *Gavyn Wright - string leader (tracks 5, 7, 10) *The Baron de Bon Bon - intro (track 11) ;Technical *Barry Hammond, Stephen Lipson \u2013 engineer *John Patrick Byrne \u2013 cover *Michael Gray \u2013 photography, management ==References== ==External links== * Category:Gerry Rafferty albums Category:1980 albums Category:United Artists Records albums ",
