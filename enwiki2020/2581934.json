Latty's Pleasure Grounds, the Butterfly Hall, Hollywood Park and the Lansdowne Reserve were popular ventures which fringed the river and lakes system. The amusement parks were struggling by the time of the Great Depression and eventually the land that they occupied was acquired by the council for public reserves.Book of Sydney Suburbs, p.148 It is a little-known fact that the first games of Rugby League football in Australia, in early 1908, were trial games that took place in Lansvale, at Latty's Pleasure Grounds. This was before the first official competition games tookplace at venues closer to the City of Sydney, and well before professional Rugby League clubs came to the further western suburbs of Sydney, such as Parramatta, Canterbury-Bankstown and Western Suburbs. The suburb developed in the 1950s when the peripheral areas of Bankstown municipality assumed identities of their own. One popular housing estate is known as River Heights, where stylishly designed houses with every modern detail and a luxurious finish have been built. A local landmark is Lansdowne Bridge, a sandstone bridge built between 1834 and 1836, designed and supervised by David Lennox. The bridge is listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, 1981, p.2/24 Magic Kingdom was an amusement park that operated in Lansvale from the 1970s to the 1990s. == Heritage listings == Lansvale has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Hume Highway: Lansdowne Bridge ==People== According to the 2016 census, Lansvale had a population of 2,570 people with a median age of 39, which was slightly higher than the national median age of 38.
