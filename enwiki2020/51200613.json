    "text": "The Latin American and Caribbean Economic Association (LACEA) is an international association of economists with common research interests in Latin America. It was founded in July 1992, to encourage professional interaction and foster increased dialogue among researchers and practitioners whose work focuses on the economies of Latin America and the Caribbean. Since 1996, its Annual Meetings bring together scholars, practitioners and students to discuss research papers and listen to invited keynote speakers who present the latest academic findings in economic and social development issues. LACEA fosters several thematic research networks, publishes the academic journal Economia, and administers the digital repository LACER-LACEA. == Objectives of LACEA == The objectives of the Latin American and Caribbean Economic Association are: * To encourage research and teaching related to the economies of Latin American and Caribbean countries and to foster dialogue among researchers and practitioners whose work focuses on the economies of the region. As a matter of policy, LACEA welcomes economists of all nationalities, theoretical orientations and policy perspectives. * To encourage interaction among scholars, teachers and policy-makers residing and working in Latin America and the Caribbean and professionals residing outside the region. * To sponsor programs, meetings, conferences and other opportunities for scholarly exchange among individuals and organizations concerned with the economies of Latin American and Caribbean nations. In this capacity, LACEA can act both independently and as a member of other professional or nonprofit associations. == A Brief History == How it all started The Latin American and Caribbean Economic Association (LACEA), or Asociaci\u00f3n de Econom\u00eda de Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe, was founded in July 1992 in order to encourage greater professional interaction and foster increased dialogue among researchers and practitioners who focus their work on the economies of Latin America and the Caribbean. The idea of creating such an association of economists was first put into action during the April 1991 Washington, DC meetings of the Latin American Studies Association by Michael Conroy, then a professor of economics at the University of Texas at Austin. At a meeting attended by close to forty participants, a seven-member Organizing Committee, led by Nora Lustig, was appointed. The Organizing Committee quickly obtained enthusiastic support for the idea of creating an association from a dozen leading scholars in the field, including Albert Hirschman, Eliana Cardoso, John Williamson, and Albert Fishlow. This early support was critical to the success of the efforts to create LACEA. Soon after, the Organizing Committee identified the initial Executive Committee, drafted the association\u2019s bylaws, and applied for membership of the Allied Social Science Association (ASSA), officially launching LACEA. Over one hundred prominent economists from throughout the region were invited and accepted the invitation to be charter members of LACEA. The first Executive Committee was selected and Albert Fishlow, then professor at the University of California, Berkeley was invited to become the first President of LACEA. Nora Lustig, then at the Brookings Institution, was selected as Vice-President, and Darryl McLeod, professor at Fordham University, was invited to become the Treasurer of the association. The other members of the Executive Committee were: Edmar Bacha, Carlos Bazdresch, Guillermo Calvo, Michael Conroy, Vittorio Corbo, Carmen Diana Deere, Sebastian Edwards, Raul Feliz, Daniel Heymann, Ricardo Hausmann, Patricio Meller, and John Welch. On July 1, 1994 the charter members officially approved LACEA's Bylaws and its first Executive Committee. In January, 1993, under Albert Fishlow\u2019s presidency (1993\u201397) LACEA became a member of the Allied Social Science Association and soon began to host sessions at the annual meetings of the American Economics Association, the Latin American Studies Association and the Latin American Meetings of the Econometric Society. In 1996, LACEA began to host annual international meetings of its own. The first meeting was hosted by ITAM, in Mexico City, and featured 157 papers and over 200 participants. The 1997 meeting was held in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia and was co-organized by Fedesarrollo and Universidad de los Andes. At this meeting, close to 250 participants attended and 208 papers were presented. Ever since, the meetings have taken place annually (see the Lacea's Annual Meeting section above), attracting larger numbers of participants and papers. On average since 2010, 560 economists have attended LACEA's meetings, and 280 papers have been presented during the three-day conference. Under Nora Lustig\u2019s presidency (1998\u201399), LACEA expanded its activities in several directions. In conjunction with the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank, it created the Network on Inequality and Poverty in 1998. It also started the Network on Political Economy and a series of seminars on International Economics and Finance, a joint initiative with the Center for International Economics at the University of Maryland. All these activities were carried out in conjunction with academic centers in Latin America and the Caribbean. In 1999, at the Fourth Annual Meetings in Santiago, LACEA announced the launching of a new academic Journal, Economia. Professor Andres Velasco was appointed as Editor of the journal, which was modeled on the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity and Economic Policy. The first issue was released in 2000. Another significant event in 1999 was the awarding of a major grant to LACEA from the Development Grant Facility of the World Bank (later transformed into the Global Development Network), which gave support to the annual meetings, the research networks, and the journal. Since 2000, Professors Fishlow and Lustig have played many influential roles in the Association, most importantly as advisers to the presidents and the Executive Committee, and as goodwill ambassadors of the Association before other international organizations and academic institutions. In recognition of their contributions, the title of President Emeritus was awarded to Professors Fishlow and Lustig at the 2017 Lacea meeting in Buenos Aires (November 9\u201311). Developments: meetings and networks Subsequent presidents have expanded the activities of the Association in many directions. Under Guillermo Calvo's presidency (2000\u201301) LACEA started to explore holding annual meetings outside the region. Negotiations started in 2000 with CEMFI, Spain, and came to fruition under Sebastian Edwards's presidency (2002\u201303). Thus, the 2002 meeting took place in Madrid, hosted by CEMFI, attracting researchers and scholars from Europe and broadening the LACEA network outside the region. Similarly, the 2005 meeting was held in Paris, under Mariano Tomassi\u2019s presidency (2004\u201305), and hosted by the American University in Paris. More recently, efforts have been made to hold the meetings in cities other than capitals of countries. Medell\u00edn (Colombia) in 2010 under Ricardo Hausmann\u2019s presidency (2010\u201311) and again in 2016 under Eduardo Lora\u2019s presidency (2016\u201317) hosted the meetings, organized by Eafit. Similarly, Santa Cruz de la Sierra (Bolivia) was the venue of the 2015 meeting under Eduardo Engel\u2019s presidency (2014\u201315), organized by the Bolivian Society of Economists (SEBOL), the Institute for Advanced Development Studies (INESAD) and the Private University of Santa Cruz de la Sierra (UPSA). These efforts have substantially enlarged the membership of the Association and strengthened its relations with a wider net of academic institutions within the region. In the same vein, it is expected that the 2018 meeting will take place in Guayaquil, hosted by Escuela Superior Polit\u00e9cnica del Litoral (ESPOL), under Santiago Levy\u2019s presidency (2018\u201319). Since 2006, under Andr\u00e9s Velasco\u2019s presidency (2006\u201307), the annual meetings have been jointly organized with the Latin American Chapter of the Econometric Society (LAMES). The joint LACEA-LAMES conference is currently regarded as one of the most prestigious gatherings of academic economists in the developing world, not just in Latin America. In addition to the annual meetings, LACEA holds a variety of specialized meetings, a practice initiated by its first presidents and continued by Sebastian Edwards with the Inter-American Seminar on Economics and by subsequent presidents. In parallel, the number of specialized networks has grown to eight, currently covering the following areas: Inequality and Poverty; Political Economy; Trade, Integration and Growth; Impact Evaluation; Finance; Crime; Labor and Economic History. A new network on Health Economics was created in late 2017 and will have its first meeting in 2018. Developments: research dissemination and academic awards The Econom\u00eda Journal of the Latin American and Caribbean Economic Association, launched in 2000, has continued apace, with major reorganizations under Roberto Rigob\u00f3n\u2019s presidency (2012-13), when the reviewing process through bi-annual panel meetings was substituted by the standard peer reviewing (keeping the panel meetings for discussion purposes), and in 2017 under Carlos Vegh\u2019s leadership as Editor, when the bi-annual call for submissions was replaced by on-line rolling submissions. The Journal has boasted an impressive list of Editors: Andr\u00e9s Velasco, Eduardo Engel, Francisco Ferreira, Roberto Rigob\u00f3n, Rodrigo Soares, Ugo Panizza, Raquel Bernal, Marcela Eslava, Sergio Urz\u00faa, Juli\u00e1n Messina and Alexander Monge- Naranjo. Many more distinguished scholars have been Associate Editors. Economia has become the outlet of choice for some of the best research on Latin America and is currently ranked 71st among nearly 2000 journals worldwide evaluated by RePec and undergoing an accreditation process. Other channels of research dissemination administered by LACEA include the internet site Vox.LACEA, created under Mauricio C\u00e1rdenas\u2019 presidency (2008\u201309), and the Latin American and Caribbean Economic Repository, LACER, created under Roberto Rigob\u00f3n\u2019s (2012-13). M\u00e1ximo Rossi is currently the editor of Vox.LACEA and LACER. A new dissemination channel was added to this list: the LACEA Working Paper Series (LACEA.WPS), which was launched at the Buenos Aires meeting. Established researchers based on Latin America or with ties to LACEA, who have an outstanding record of publications in top journals, will become LACEA Associates and will have the exclusive right to publish their (not yet peer- reviewed) research in the LACEA Working Paper Series. The first Editor-in- chief of LACEA.WPS is Irene Brambilla. In order to encourage high-quality research and recognize talented scholars\u2019 contributions, several awards have been established. The Carlos D\u00edaz-Alejandro Prize, created in 1998, has been awarded every two years to outstanding scholars who have made significant contributions to economic policy issues of especial relevance to the region. Edmar Bacha, Arnold Harberger, Rudiger Dornbusch, Guillermo Calvo, Jere Behrman, Hugo Hopenhayn, Sebastian Edwards, Carmen Reinhart and Orazio Attanasio have been recipients of this distinction. Under Ricardo Hausmann\u2019s presidency (2010-11), the Juan Luis Londo\u00f1o Prize was created to encourage research in social policy issues. Francois Bourguignon was the first recipient of the Prize. It is currently awarded every two years to the best paper on social issues presented at the LACEA meeting by a young researcher. How LACEA\u2019s governance has evolved The foundational Bylaws approved in 1998 have served the organization well, with only one revision in 2015 introduced during Eduardo Engel\u2019s presidency, by which a system of permanent committees was established and the responsibilities of the Executive Committee members and of some of the leading administrative positions were redefined. Also under Eduardo Engel, a protocol was signed with the Latin American Chapter of the Econometric Society (LAMES) in order to clarify the terms of collaboration between the two associations for the organization of the joint LACEA-LAMES meetings. Every two years, the active members of the Association have voted to elect the new Vice-President (who becomes the President after two years) and six new members of the Executive Committee (who serve for four years). Seven of the 12 members of the current Executive Committee (2016-2017) are women, as well as the next Vice-President (2018-19) and President (2020-21), Raquel Fern\u00e1ndez. Since the presidency of Mauricio C\u00e1rdenas (2008-09), the Secretariat of LACEA is hosted at Fedesarrollo in Bogot\u00e1. The current Executive Secretary is Ana Mar\u00eda D\u00edaz, assisted by Elena Zadic. Executive Secretaries have been crucial for the success of the organization. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Years !!
