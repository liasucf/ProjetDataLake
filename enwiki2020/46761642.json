The helicopter has a turbo-charged engine to enable it to operate at high altitude, and its payload is installed under the chin. Specification: *Endurance (h): > 1 *Max payload (kg): 30 *Ceiling (km): 6 *Max speed (km/h): 150 *Remote control range (km): > 60 *Date transmission (km): > 10 *Wind allowed for operation (m/s): 18.5 *Temperature allowed for operation (\u2070C): - 20 to 50 *Relative humidity allowed for operation: 95% *Engine MTBF (h): > 1000 ==Multirotors== As of 2015, two multicopters are fielded by PowerVision, the quadcopter PowerQuad, and the octocopter PowerOcta. These multicopters are mainly intended for aerial photography, cinematography and surveying applications. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%; margin-right: 0;\" |- ! style=\"background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;\"| Model ! style=\"background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;\"| PowerQuad ! style=\"background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;\"| PowerOcta |- | Depth (mm): | 560 | 1380 |- | Width (mm): | 690 | 1380 |- | Height (mm): | 200 | 250 |- | Rotors (blades x pair): | 2 x 2 | 2 x 4 | |- | Endurance (min): | 25 | > 60 |- | Max payload (kg): | 1.5 | 4 |- | Max speed (km/h): | > 50 | > 50 |- | Ceiling (km): | 5.5 | 6 |- | Remote control range (km): | 5 \u2013 50 | > 60 |- | Data transmission (km): | 5 | 5 |- | Max wind allowed for operation (m/s): | 12 | 12 |- | Temperature range for operation (\u2070C): | - 20 to 50 | - 20 to 50 |- | Noise level (dB): | < 70 | < 70 |- |} ==PowerSeeker== PowerSeeker is a fixed-wing UAV in low wing configuration with canards and winglets, but without vertical tail. Propulsion is provided by a propeller driven pusher engine mounted at the empennage. The tricycle landing gear is fixed. The UAV adopts modular design, which enables it can be rapidly assembled or taken apart within an hour and stored in a container that less than two meters long, thus making it easy for storage and transportation. PowerSeeker is mainly intended for aerial survey missions. Specification: *Endurance (h): 12 \u2013 20 *Max payload (kg): 30 *Max take-off weight (kg): 90 *Ceiling (km): 10 *Max speed (km/h): 280 *Min speed (km/h): 70 *Remote control range (km): > 80 *Wingspan (m): 2.5 *Take-off & landing distance (m): < 200 *Deployment time (h): < 1 ==See also== List of unmanned aerial vehicles of China ==References== Category:Unmanned aerial vehicles of China ",
