From January 2017 until January 2020, she was the managing director of the John Lewis department store chain. ==Early life== Nickolds was born in February 1973. Her father, Clive Nickolds, was a senior director at Marks & Spencer, and head of its international operations. She earned a bachelor's degree in history from the University of Southampton. ==Career== In 1994, Nickolds joined John Lewis as a graduate trainee at their Oxford Street flagship store. In January 2017, she succeeded Andy Street as managing director of John Lewis; she thereby became the first woman to hold this position in the company's 153-year history. She unexpectedly left the company in January 2020, along with two of John Lewis' most senior, long serving executives, just as it looked to navigate a radical overhaul to merge its grocery and department store businesses. ==References== Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:British businesspeople Category:British women in business ",
