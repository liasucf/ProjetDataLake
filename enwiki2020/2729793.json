    "text": "White mustard seeds (right) compared with rice seeds (left) White mustard (Sinapis alba) is an annual plant of the family Brassicaceae. It is sometimes also referred to as Brassica alba or B. hirta. Grown for its seeds, used to make the condiment mustard, as fodder crop, or as a green manure, it is now widespread worldwide, although it probably originated in the Mediterranean region. ==Description== White mustard is an annual, growing to 70 cm high with stalkless pinnate leaves, similar to Sinapis arvensis.Webb, D.A., Parnell, J. and Doogue, D. 1996. An Irish Flora. Dundalgan Press Ltd., Dundalk. ==Distribution== Most common in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, it can be found worldwide. It has been found as far north as Greenland,Beesley, S. and Wilde, J. 1997. Urban Flora of Belfast. The Institute of Irish Studies and The Queen's University of Belfast. . and naturalized throughout Great Britain and Ireland.Clapham, A.R., Tutin, T.G. and Warburg, E.F. 1968 Excursion Flora of the British Isles. Cambridge University Press. ==Culinary uses== The yellow flowers of the plant produce hairy seed pods, with each pod containing roughly a half dozen seeds. These seeds are harvested just prior to the pods becoming ripe and bursting. White mustard seeds are hard round seeds, usually around in diameter, with a color ranging from beige or yellow to light brown. They can be used whole for pickling or toasted for use in dishes. When ground and mixed with other ingredients, a paste or more standard condiment can be produced. Sinapis alba is used to make the commonplace yellow table mustard, with additional yellow coloring provided by turmeric in some formulations. The seeds contain sinalbin, which is a thioglycoside responsible for their pungent taste. White mustard has fewer volatile oils and the flavor is considered to be milder than that produced by black mustard seeds. In Greece, the plant's leaves can be eaten during the winter, before it blooms. Greeks call it vrouves (\u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03b2\u03b1) or lapsana (\u03bb\u03b1\u03c8\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1). The blooming season of this plant (February\u2013March) is celebrated with the Mustard Festival, a series of festivities in the wine country of California (Napa and Sonoma Counties). ==Other uses== White mustard is commonly used as a cover and green manure crop in Europe (between UK and Ukraine). A large number of varieties exist, e.g. in Germany, Netherlands, mainly differing in lateness of flowering and resistance against white beet- cyst nematode (Heterodera schachtii). Farmers prefer late-flowering varieties, which do not produce seeds, as they may become weeds in the subsequent year. Early vigour is important to cover the soil quickly to suppress weeds and protect the soil against erosion. In rotations with sugar beets, suppression of the white beet-cyst nematode is an important trait. Resistant white mustard varieties reduce nematode populations by 70-90%. ==Gallery== Image:Sinapis alba 1.JPG|flowering plant Image:Sinapis alba Habitus 2010-4-11 DehesaBoyalPuertollano.jpg|plant Image:Gele mosterd bloemen Sinapis alba.jpg|flowers Image:Sinapis alba fruits IP0307031.jpg|seed pods Image:Gele mosterd groenbemesting (Sinapis alba green manuring).jpg|cover crop ==See also== * Mustard plant * Mustard seed ==References== ==External links== * http://www.maltawildplants.com/CRUC/Sinapis_alba.php Comprehensive profile for Sinapis alba. * Sinapis alba Flowers in Israel Category:Spices Category:Brassicaceae Category:Medicinal plants Category:Plants described in 1753 ",
