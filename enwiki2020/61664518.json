Gallant (credited as Michael Gallant), who also directed the film, and co-produced with Rob Bonet. The film was shown in film festivals and then released on home video by Ariztical Entertainment on November 23, 2004. In the film, after ending his ten-year relationship, a 30-ish gay West Hollywood caterer must either find his perfect match within ten dates or return to his hometown. The film has received mixed reviews. ==Plot== A gay West Hollywood caterer Josh Stevens (Jason Stuart) in his 30s ends his ten-year relationship with his partner who is cheating on him with another man. Josh's friend Brendon (Christopher Cowan) bets newly single Josh that Josh can either find his suitable mate within ten dates or, if neither of ten dates suits Josh well, return to his hometown Cleveland, Ohio. Josh assumes his first suitor Jimmy (Michael Lee Haring) to have been using drugs Calamia does not name characters whom he describes respectively as an \"unemployed cokehead\" and a \"self-important bore\". when Jimmy quickly returns from a restroom. His second suitor Bryce (Scott Kennedy) gives Josh a magazine filled with Bryce's writings on celebrities' faces, including Bryce's circles on heterosexual male celebrities whom Bryce admires. The third suitor Billy (David Faustino) wants Josh involved in a threesome proposed by Billy's girlfriend, which Josh rejects. The fourth suitor whom Josh briefly dates at a Los Angeles Pride parade is a US Marine soldier and a circuit boy. Josh comes into an apartment of his fifth suitor who apparently wants a one-night stand.Most of the scenes with Josh's fifth suitor did not make the final cut. See #Production. The sixth suitor goes to gay bathhouses, which Josh does not want to experience at. The seventh suitor Steven (Hilliard Guess) angrily scolds a bartender for putting a lemon on Steven's drink instead of lime that he requested and throws a lemon on the bartender. When Josh ends the date, Steven splashes a drink on Josh. The eighth suitor \"does nothing but talk about himself\". The ninth suitor Leo (Joey Vieira), a hustler whom Josh met at group therapy sessions, reveals his dark past to and, after their first date, then has sex with Josh against Josh's wishes to date more, making Josh feel regretful and feel like one of Leo's escorts. The tenth and final suitor Nick (Scott Larson) at first seems to be Josh's perfect match after their several dates. However, then Nick has not shown up to the latest date with Josh, who is unaware of Nick's active marriage with his wife and affair with a drag queen. Depressed, Josh becomes intoxicated for the whole night. The following week, after his failed ten dates, Josh decides to return to Cleveland for a while. At a train station, he encounters his former schoolmate Jack Langford (Fritz Greve), also Josh's bully back in high school, who is also heading to Cleveland and then reveals himself as gay by telling Josh that Jack ended his own relationship with his boyfriend. As both are heading to the train to Cleveland, Jack admits his guilt to the pain he caused on Josh and asks him how to make up the bad times. ==Cast and characters== Actor Jason Stuart (pictured in 2010), also one of film producers and one of story improvisers, portrays the film's main character Josh Stevens. * Jason Stuart as Josh Stevens, a gay West Hollywood caterer in his 30s who, after ending his ten-year relationship with Lyle (Rusty Updegraff) who cheats on him with a 19-year-old Todd (Ben Crowley), re- enters the dating scene and then eventually returns to his hometown Cleveland, Ohio after finding neither of his ten suitors to be his soulmates ** Joseph Cohen as young Josh in October 1979 * Jim J.

It then was screened as part of the 2006 Out In Africa South African Gay and Lesbian Film Festival. ==Critical reception== Stonewall News Northwest reviewer Christopher Lawrence in December 2004 criticized the acting, the improvisation as \"border[line] shallow\", the audio quality, and the use of \"home video camera\" as part of cinematography. Nevertheless, Lawrence praised the appearances of Jason Stuart, Judy Tenuta, and then-newcomer Christopher Cowan, whom Lawrence characterized as \"charmingly sweet and more convincing than most of the other men.\" Filmcritic.com writer Don Willmott in the same year rated the film three out of five stars, criticizing the film for exaggerating clich\u00e9s of West Hollywood's gay dating scene and its \"clunky ending\". Willmott also criticized the film production as rushed. The Independent Critic writer Richard Propes graded the film a \"B+\" and three and a half out of four stars, calling it \"enjoyable\" despite being one of \"quirky, bad films.\" Propes also called the ending \"refreshing and well written.\" Pride Source writer Don Calamia in 2016 criticized the film as \"predictable\", writing that \"the story is far too familiar\" and irrelevant to those living outside West Hollywood. Calamia also criticized the main protagonist's potential suitors as \"recycled jerks\" already done in other films and exaggeration of West Hollywood clich\u00e9s. However, he praised the ending as \"'O. Henry'-ish\", \"the most original aspect of the story\", and suitable to believers of \"fairy tales.\" ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Category:2004 LGBT-related films Category:2000s direct- to-video films Category:LGBT-related romantic comedy films Category:2000s romantic comedy films Category:Films shot in Los Angeles County Category:Improvised films Category:Films set in Los Angeles County, California Category:Gay-related films Category:2004 comedy films ",
