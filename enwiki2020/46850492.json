Garden Reach was later taken out. Post-independence developments saw the introduction of adult franchise in municipal elections in 1962. The number of wards increased from 75 to 100. Tollygunge was merged with Kolkata in 1953. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act 1980, which came into effect in 1984, extended the boundaries of Kolkata by including South Suburban, Garden Reach and Jadavpur municipalities in Kolkata. With the addition of Joka to Kolkata, the number of wards rose to 144. ==Geography== Ward No. 97 is bordered on the north by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Road and Graham Road; on the east by Nagendra Narayan Dutta Road; and on the south and the west by Tolly\u2019s Nullah.
