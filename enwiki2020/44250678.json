He arrived in Jayavarman VII's court in 1182 from Tumpraukvijaya, and was educated as a prince \"in all branches of knowledge and all weapons\". In 1190 he took part in the war against Champa and seized the capital Vijaya, capturing King Jaya Indravarman IV. Adopting the title of Shri Suryavarmadeva, he made himself king of Panduranga. He made Prince In, a brother-in-law of Jayavarman VII, \"King Suryajayavarmadeva in the Nagara of Vijaya\" (or Suryajayavarman).Maspero, G., 2002, The Champa Kingdom, Bangkok: White Lotus Co., Ltd., In 1191, a revolt at Viajaya drove Suryajayavarman back to Cambodia and enthroned Jaya Indravarman V.
