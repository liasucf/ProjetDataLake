Their haul is snatched from them by another gang under the notorious Gr\u00e9gori, wanted by several crime-fighting agencies. One is the FBI, whose top man in France is Jeff Gordon, posing as an international gangster. With back-up from the local police, he gets on the trail of Gr\u00e9gori and the loot. Clues lead him to a manor in the country run by a Dr Mercier as a rest home for rich invalids, particularly neurotic women, but his initiatives keep getting foiled by a young woman named Lisa. After much competition between the two, she eventually admits she is a private investigator hired by the insurers to find the diamonds and agrees to co-operate. She gets a lawyer to name her part-owner of the manor and Jeff gets admitted as a patient. While they try to sniff out Mercier's racket and discover if Gr\u00e9gori is there. the gang that lost the diamonds are also preparing to assault the manor. Snooping about, Jeff discovers a hidden operating theatre where Mercier alters the faces and fingerprints of criminals. Next day he is going to operate on Gr\u00e9gori, but Jeff replaces him in the theatre robes and mask. The operation does not proceed because the other gang attack the manor in force with automatics and grenades, followed shortly by squads of police. Jeff gets away, leaving Gr\u00e9gori's diamonds with Lisa, but she is stuck in a tooth and nails fight with an equally pretty patient who also had her eye on Jeff. ==Cast== * Eddie Constantine as Jeff Gordon * Perrette Pradier as Lisa Lambert * Daniel Emilfork as Yanakos - le grec * Cl\u00e9ment Harari as Lorenz/Dr Gordon/Dr Mercier * Jean Galland as Le commissaire * Paul Bonifas as Le notaire * as Barbara * Sophie Hardy as Claudine * Bernard Musson as M.
