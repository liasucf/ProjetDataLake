    "text": "\"Soul Passing Through Soul\" is the second single released by Toyah Willcox as a solo artist. The song, and its b-side were taken from her debut solo album Minx. Released in June 1985, it failed to enter the Top 40, peaking at number 57. It spent 3 weeks on the UK Singles Chart. Like many of the tracks on Minx the song suffers from a somewhat sterile mid-80's production, where fans may have been hoping for some of the punk energy of her previous work. The Extended Mix which features on the 12\" vinyl was added to the Minx 2005 CD reissue. ==Track listing== === 7\" Vinyl === * A: Soul Passing Through Soul [Willcox/St. James] * B: All in a Rage [Willcox/Bogen] Catalogue Number: A 6359 === 12\" Vinyl === * A: Soul Passing Through Soul (Extended Mix) [Willcox/St. James] * B1: Soul Passing Through Soul [Willcox/St. James] * B2: All in a Rage [Willcox/Bogen] Catalogue Number: TA 6359 Produced by Christopher Neil. == Personnel == * Toyah Willcox : vocals, backing vocals * Mike St. James : backing vocals * Chris Neil : backing vocals * Andy Brown : bass * Peter Van Hooke : drums * Al Hodge : guitar * Ian Wherry : keyboards * Frank Ricotti : percussion * Ray Beavis: saxophone * John Earle : saxophone == References == Category:Toyah Willcox songs Category:1985 singles Category:Songs written by Toyah Willcox Category:1985 songs Category:Portrait Records singles ",
