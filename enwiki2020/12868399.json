    "text": "Tied & Tickled Trio is a German electronica/dub/jazz musical collective. It was founded in 1994 by Markus Acher and Christoph Brandner in Weilheim, Bavaria as a polyrythmic duo playing drums only. After the joining of sculptor Andreas Gerth (electronics) and Markus' brother Micha (bass), the core of \"Tied & Tickled Trio\" was formed and their style turned to jazz.
