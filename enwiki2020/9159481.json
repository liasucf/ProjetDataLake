    "text": "Barney Live In New York City (originally titled Barney Live! At Radio City, also known as Barney & Friends: Live in New York City) is a Barney & Friends stage show, taped at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on March 6, 1994 and released on video on August 26, 1994. It was also the largest Barney & Friends stage show, much to its size. ==Plot== Barney and his friends take the stage to delight and entertain everyone at Radio City Music Hall. They all work together to make a special surprise for the audience using items from \"The Barney Bag\". But before they are able to share it, a new visitor, The Winkster, steals the bag and runs away with it. Throughout the show, the kids are trying to catch The Winkster and teach him that it is important to have friends and to share. Also, the chase takes everyone to \"Barney's Imagination Circus\" with fun-loving clowns and some dancing bears. ==Cast== * Barney (voice) - Bob West * Barney (costume) - David Joyner/Carey Stinson * Baby Bop (voice) - Julie Johnson * Baby Bop (costume) - Jeff Ayers * B.J.
