This would be her last Grand Slam title, as well as her final US Open appearance. Maria Sharapova was the defending champion, but was defeated by the 30th seed Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska in the third round. This was the final appearance of former world No. 1 and five-time Grand Slam singles champion Martina Hingis in a Grand Slam singles tournament, who retired in November 2007 (Hingis would later return to Grand Slam competition in 2013, however she focused on doubles and mixed doubles until she retired for good at the end of the 2017 season). She was beaten in the third round by Victoria Azarenka. It was also the first US Open main draw appearance for future World No. 1 and two-time US Open finalist Caroline Wozniacki, who lost in the second round to Aliz\u00e9 Cornet. ==Seeds== # Justine Henin (Champion) # Maria Sharapova (Third Round) # Jelena Jankovi\u0107 (Quarterfinals) # Svetlana Kuznetsova (Final) # Ana Ivanovic (Fourth Round) # Anna Chakvetadze (Semifinals) # Nadia Petrova (Third Round) # Serena Williams (Quarterfinals) # Daniela Hantuchov\u00e1 (First Round) # Marion Bartoli (Fourth Round) # Patty Schnyder (Third Round) # Venus Williams (Semifinals) # Nicole Vaidi\u0161ov\u00e1 (Third Round) # Elena Dementieva (Third Round) # Dinara Safina (Fourth Round) # Martina Hingis (Third Round) # Tatiana Golovin (First Round) # Shahar Pe'er (Quarterfinals) # Sybille Bammer (Fourth Round) # Lucie \u0160af\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1 (Third Round) # Alona Bondarenko (Third Round) # Katarina Srebotnik (Second Round) # Tathiana Garbin (First Round) # Francesca Schiavone (Second Round) # Mara Santangelo (First Round) # Sania Mirza (Third Round) # Vera Zvonareva (Third Round) # Ai Sugiyama (Second Round) # Samantha Stosur (First Round) # Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska (Fourth Round) # Anabel Medina Garrigues (Third Round) # Micha\u00eblla Krajicek (Second Round) ==Qualifying== ==Draw== ===Finals=== ===Top Half=== ====Section 1==== ====Section 2==== ====Section 3==== ====Section 4==== ===Bottom Half=== ====Section 5==== ====Section 6==== ====Section 7==== ====Section 8==== ==External links== * Draws *2007 US Open \u2013 Women's draws and results at the International Tennis Federation Women's Singles Category:US Open (tennis) by year \u2013 Women's Singles Category:2007 in women's tennis Category:2007 in American women's sports ",
