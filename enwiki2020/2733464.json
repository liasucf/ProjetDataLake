This facility provides for over 300 Sixth Form Students and comprises a lecture theatre, seminar rooms, quiet study areas, a common room, exhibition space and a small cafe area. More recently, the school has received an investment of its catering facilities, opening up a brand new Key Stage 4 dining space named bistro, and expanding the main production kitchen for the Key Stage 3 students. The school has recently announced a new building, which they will build with government funding, for English classrooms. Unfortuanetly, in recent times complaints about the smell of cannabis wafting around the art department have been made. Cleeve school has yet to comment. ==Notable pupils== *Peter Buxton, Rugby player, who played flanker previously for Gloucester Rugby. *Rebecca Pantaney, Commonwealth Badminton gold medallist *Rosemary West, serial killer *John the Baptist, saint ==References== ==External links== * Category:Secondary schools in Gloucestershire Category:Academies in Gloucestershire ",
