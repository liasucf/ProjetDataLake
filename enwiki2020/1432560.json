Situated a mile and a half from Haarlem center, in those days it was situated in the middle of a town called Schoten. In 1403 it was given to Margaret of Cleves (c.1375-1411), and has since retained that name.Castles in the Netherlands During the Siege of Haarlem in 1572 it was the headquarters of the Spanish army, under the leadership of the duke of Alva. It was blown up in 1573 and badly damaged, the rubble was used for city expansion. The house nearby with a tower called the \"Kaatsbaan\" was long considered the only building left standing, though recent archeological research suggests that the foundations have older stones than the rest and perhaps it was itself rebuilt after the explosion. The property changed hands several times until it was purchased by the city of Haarlem in 1713. The name \"Kaatsbaan\" refers to the sport Jeu de paume, an indoor precursor of tennisMark Zegeling (2015).

The St. Eloy's Hospice, an old guild hall in the center of Utrecht, similarly became a center for the Kolf sport after the guilds were disbanded. Stones from the central castle ruin can still be seen in surrounding buildings. The Kaatsbaan was used as a residence for former owners and is now also in use by the city gardens. In February 2006, the City of Haarlem agreed to a proposal to restore the court at Huis ter Kleef, if the Real Tennis Club Huis ter Kleef could raise the necessary funds (approximately \u20ac1,450,000).Real Tennis Club Huis ter Kleef, Project Status ==See also== *List of castles in the Netherlands *Castle Brederode, another castle ruin nearby, open to the public *Berkenrode, another castle ruin nearby, though privately owned ==References== ==External links== * Dutch Real Tennis Association * Real Tennis Club Huis ter Kleef Category:Ruined castles in the Netherlands Category:Castles in North Holland Category:Buildings and structures in Haarlem Category:History of Haarlem Category:Rijksmonuments in Haarlem Category:Jeu de paume ",
