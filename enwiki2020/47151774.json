However, official knowledge of these beings is officially kept under wraps by the governments of the world. The Japanese government has quietly set up the \"Super Population Research Laboratory\", the \"Superhuman Bureau\", to keep track of all superhuman beings in the country and eliminate them if they pose a threat to humanity. In the present, Bureau member Jiro Hitoyoshi finds himself recruiting new superhumans for the Bureau in the course of his job.
