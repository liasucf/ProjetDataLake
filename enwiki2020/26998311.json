    "text": "The BSSN formalism is a formalism of general relativity that was developed by Thomas W. _B_ aumgarte, Stuart L. _S_ hapiro, Masaru _S_ hibata and Takashi _N_ akamura between 1987 and 1999. It is a modification of the ADM formalism developed during the 1950s. The ADM formalism is a Hamiltonian formalism that does not permit stable and long-term numerical simulations. In the BSSN formalism, the ADM equations are modified by introducing auxiliary variables. The formalism has been tested for a long-term evolution of linear gravitational waves and used for a variety of purposes such as simulating the non-linear evolution of gravitational waves or the evolution and collision of black holes. ==See also== *ADM formalism *Canonical coordinates *Canonical gravity *Hamiltonian mechanics == References == Category:Mathematical methods in general relativity Category:Formalism (deductive) ",
