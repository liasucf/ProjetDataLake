Columbia Helicopters, Incorporated (CHI) is an aircraft manufacturing and operator company based in Aurora, Oregon, United States. It is known for operating tandem rotor helicopters; in present times, exclusively the Boeing Vertol 107 and Boeing Vertol 234. These helicopters are used in stream restoration and forestry including heli-logging, aerial firefighting, oil exploration, construction, government support, film production, disaster response and many other activities. In addition the company operates a large FAA repair station supporting customers around the world. ==History== ===Founding and early days=== Columbia Helicopters was founded on April 24, 1957 by Wes Lematta with a single Hiller 12B helicopter. With help from his brothers, he supported his young company with many odd jobs ranging from carrying Santa Claus to trapeze acts. He performed most of his flying on the weekends while still working as a truck driver during the week. Lematta gained great notoriety on September 15, 1957 by rescuing 15 sailors from a sinking dredge near Coos Bay, Oregon. For his heroic actions the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers awarded him the Army Air Medal. ===Direct Visual Observational Control=== After purchasing the more powerful Hiller 12E, Lematta began to operate more lift jobs. One of these large jobs was working on the John Day Dam on his company's namesake, the Columbia River. Here Lematta began performing precision lift jobs by using a longer than average cable. The concept was that the pilot could lean out the side of the aircraft and see directly where the load would be placed. A few years later, Wes' brother Jim was flying a Sikorsky S-61 in the Colorado Rockies. He was so cold he was forced to land. To fill the need for an enclosed cockpit, Columbia developed the first pilot bubble window. ===\"First in Heli-Logging\"=== Jack Erickson, of Erickson Air-Crane fame, and Lematta were able to demonstrate the first financially successful run of helicopter logging, or \"heli-logging\", in 1971. This was done with Lematta's Sikorsky S-61, registration number N318Y, on a U.S. Forest Service log sale near Taylorsville, California in the Plumas National Forest. The following year the 107s were used. Since the project used Lematta's helicopter and Erickson had purchased the timber, both Columbia Helicopters and Erikson Air-Crane claim to be the first successful \"heli-loggers\". Another unusual feat was pulling a hoverbarge on snow, ice and water in 1982.\"Happy birthday to Columbia Helicopters! Oregon-based company celebrates its 50th anniversary\" Vertical (magazine), 18 April 2007. Retrieved: 24 August 2012.\"The hover barge\" Columbia Helicopters. Retrieved: 24 August 2012. ===Type certificates=== As of December 15, 2006 Columbia Helicopters had purchased the type certificate of the Model 107 and Model 234 from Boeing. Currently the company is seeking FAA issuance of a production certificate (PC) to produce parts, with eventual issuance of a PC to produce both aircraft. ===In popular media=== Columbia Helicopters' Kawasaki Vertol KV-107 II, painted in a special grey paint scheme, at Fox Field Columbia Helicopters aircraft have appeared in several motion pictures: * Coogan's Bluff * Demolition Man - BV-234 N241CH serves as a Los Angeles Police Department helicopter. * King Kong Lives - BV-107 N191CH, a former US Navy CH-46, carries away King Kong in his cage. * The Lost World: Jurassic Park - BV-234 N241CH flies in a large cage to capture dinosaurs. * More American Graffiti * Runaway Train * Starman - KV-107 N185CH can be seen in company colors hauling away actor Jeff Bridges' spaceship. * Straight Up: Helicopters in ActionStraight Up: Helicopters in Action \\- CHI BV-234 N239CH demonstrates the lifting capability of the Super Grapple during heli-logging operations. * Under Siege - KV-107 N192CH flies Tommy Lee Jones' band out to the battleship. * X2: X-Men United - KV-107 N192CH performs various flight sequences and serves in the background of several scenes. ==Fleet== Columbia currently operates eight Boeing-Vertol Model 234s and 14 Boeing-Vertol 107-IIs tandem rotor helicopters. Many of the latter were obtained from New York Airways. In addition to the flying fleet, in 2005 CHI purchased eight surplus Canadian Forces CH-113 Labrador helicopters for fleet expansion. For fleet support CHI operates a Beechcraft 200C Super King Air.N111NS on Airliners.net When the 234s operate internationally, five containers are used for support tasks.Huber, Mark. \"Erickson and Columbia: Keeping The Big Blades Flying\" AINonline, 5 October 2014.
