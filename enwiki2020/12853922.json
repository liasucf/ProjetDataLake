    "text": "Alectryon macrococcus, known as Alaalahua or M\u0101hoe in Hawaiian, is a species of flowering tree in the soapberry family, Sapindaceae, that is endemic to Hawaii. Alectryon macrococcus var. auwahiensis has been found growing naturally only (endemic) in Maui, where it grows in Hawaiian tropical dry forests on the south slope of Haleakal\u0101 at elevations of . It is threatened by habitat loss. Alectryon macrococcus var. macrococcus inhabits mesic forests at elevations of on Kauai, Oahu, Molokai and western Maui. These trees can reach tall. Their leaves are each made up of oval-shaped, asymmetrical, net-veined leaflets. Variety auwahiensis has leaflets with rusty-red undersides. The fruits contain a seed with a bright red aril. The arils are sweet-tasting and were food for native Hawaiians. The seeds also attract rats, whose consumption of them prevents the plants of this endangered species from reproducing. The black twig borer (Xylosandrus compactus) destroys the twigs. ==References== ==External links== macrococcus Category:Plants described in 1890 Category:Endemic flora of Hawaii Category:Trees of Hawaii Category:Critically endangered plants Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
