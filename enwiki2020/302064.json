    "text": "A Monte Cristo sandwich is an egg-dipped ham and cheese sandwich that is pan or deep fried, a variation of the French croque-monsieur. In the 1930s\u20131960s, American cookbooks had recipes for this sandwich under such names as \"French sandwich\", \"toasted ham sandwich\", and \"French toasted cheese sandwich\". ==Description== In most regions, the sandwich is savory rather than sweet. Traditionally, it is dipped in its entirety in egg batter and pan-fried, though it may also be deep-fried.Zaballos, Nausica. Mythes et Gastronomie de l'ouest am\u00e9ricain : sur la route ! Le Square, 2014, p. 27. Regional variations may include sliced turkey. In some areas of the contiguous U.S. it is served grilled; in others, it is an open sandwich with only the bread battered and the assembled sandwich heated slightly under a grill or broiler. Some restaurants serve a variation that is batter-dipped and deep-fried. The Monte Cristo is sometimes covered in powdered sugar and served with maple syrup or preserves. ==See also== * Cheese dream * Croque-monsieur * Cuisine of New York City * French toast * Grilled cheese * List of sandwiches * Reuben sandwich * Welsh rabbit ==References== ==External links== * Count the Monte Cristos at The Stranger Category:American sandwiches Category:Cheese sandwiches ",
