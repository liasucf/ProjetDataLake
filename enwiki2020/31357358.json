    "text": "The Bolivian Yungas is a tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest ecoregion in the Yungas of central Bolivia and eastern Peru. ==Setting== The ecoregion occurs in elevations ranging from on the eastern slopes of the Andes in Bolivia. It forms a transition zone between the Southwest Amazon moist forests to the northeast and the Central Andean puna and wet puna to the southeast. ==Climate== The climate in this ecoregion varies from tropical rainforest to tropical monsoon. Fog and rain deposited by northern trade winds contribute to the high humidity and precipitation of the Yungas. ==Flora== Epiphytes are abundant and include bromeliads, orchids, and tree-ferns (Cyathea). Chusquea bamboo is an indicator species of the ecoregion. ==Fauna== Mammals found in this ecoregion include the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), Geoffroy\u2019s cat (Leopardus geoffroyi), lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris), jaguar (Panthera onca), jaguarundi (Puma yagouaroundi), pacarana (Dinomys branickii), and brocket deer (Mazama chunyi). Interesting bird species include the diademed tapaculo (Scytalopus schulenbergi), green-capped tanager (Tangara meyerdeschauenseei), Andean cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola peruvianus), and southern helmeted curassow (Pauxi unicornis). ==Natural areas== Steep terrain, high precipitation, and difficult access have kept much of this ecoregion in a natural state. Protected areas include: *Tambopata- Candamo *Carrasco National Park *Madidi National Park *Ambor\u00f3 National Park *Isiboro S\u00e9cure National Park and Indigenous Territory *Pil\u00f3n Lajas Biosphere Reserve and Communal Lands ==References== Category:Yungas Category:Ecoregions of the Andes Category:Ecoregions of Peru Category:Ecoregions of Bolivia Category:Forests of Bolivia Category:Forests of Peru Category:Neotropical tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests Category:Montane forests ",
