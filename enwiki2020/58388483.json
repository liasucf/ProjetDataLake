MacNeil (1960), Tertiary and Quaternary Gastropoda of Okinawa; Professional Paper 339; USGS There seems to be confusion about the accepted name of this species. According to the University of Tokyo, the accepted name is Crassispira pseudoprincipalis,University of Tokyo: Crassispira pseudoprincipalis (Yokoyama, 1920) while according to the World Register of Marine Species, the accepted name is Inquisitor pseudoprincipalis.MolluscaBase (2018). Inquisitor pseudoprincipalis (Yokoyama, 1920). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at: http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=761950 on 2018-10-16 Both rely on the basionym Pleurotoma (Drillia) pseudoprincipalis Yokoyama, 1920. ==Description== The length of the shell attains 27.5 mm, its diameter 8.3 mm. According to Makiyama (1927, p. 104), Japanese specimens of this species differ from Crassispira bataviana (Martin, 1895) in having a shorter siphonal canal. The same appears to be true of the Okinawan and Formosan specimens. ==Distribution== Fossils have been found in Miocene in Japan and in Pliocene strata in Okinawa, Japan. ==References== * Yokoyama, 1920.
