    "text": "Southern Funen's List (Danish: Sydfyns Borgerliste) is a regional political party set in the municipalities on the southern parts of Funen, more specifically Faaborg-Midtfyn and Svendborg. ==History== In 2005 and 2009, Southern Funen's List ran in Svendborg, Gudme and Egebjerg Municipality. After a fairly poor election in 2009, the party was dissolved. In 2013, Jan Valbak, Palle Petersen and Palle Andersen re-founded the party, this time with more focus on Faaborg. The party received 1.505 votes, ensuring them a seat in the municipal council. The name of the party was changed to Borgerlisten in the 2017 election, where the party did not receive enough votes for a seat in the municipal council. ==Politicians from Southern Funen's List== *Leif Nybo: Former chairman. *Jan Valbak: Co-founder and current chairman.Medietorvet, 2013 \"Portr\u00e6t: Faaborg i hjertet, Faaborg i Hjernen\" *Palle Petersen: Co- founder.Ugeavisen Faaborg, 2013. \"Valbak - en af valgets store vindere\" *Palle Andersen: Co-founder.Ugeavisen Faaborg, 2013. \"Valbak - en af valgets store vindere\" ==Election results== === Municipal elections === {|class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Date ! rowspan=\"2\"| Votes ! colspan=\"2\"| Seats |- ! # ! \u00b1 |- ! 2005 | 1.168 | |New |- ! 2009 | 579 | | 1 |- ! 2013 |1.505 | | 1 |- ! 2017 | 718 | | 1 |} ==References== Category:Political parties in Denmark Category:Regionalist parties Category:Political parties with year of establishment missing ",
