    "text": "The Tranky Doo (also called Trunky Doo) is a jazz dance choreography. A source states it was choreographed by Frankie Manning himself and \u2033...named in tribute to the chorus girl who inspired it.\u2033Frankie Manning - Ambassador of Lindy Hop At that time, it was danced to Tuxedo Junction, however many modern day performances of the dance use other swing jazz songs. It is most common these days to perform the dance with the song \"Dipsy Doodle\" by Ella Fitzgerald because the dance appears in the Spirit Moves documentary film with a playback of the song. However the film originally had no sound, and the song \"Dipsy Doodle\" was artificially superimposed on that section of the film. Dipsy Doodle's structure does not fit the structure of the Tranky Doo, since the song is a 12-bar blues structure and the choreography is 32-bar swing structure. It was common to Lindy hoppers, like the shim sham.
