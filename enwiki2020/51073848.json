    "text": "Tazewell Merriman Starkey (1829-1901) (also known as \"T. Marian Starkey\") was a prominent farmer, banker and civic leader in Roanoke County, Virginia. Born in Franklin County, Virginia and moved to Roanoke County, Virginia, in 1850. \"He was a son of Mr. and Mrs. Jack Starkey, and was educated in the private schools of his native county... In May, 1865, he was married to Henrietta P. Harvey, daughter of Colonel and Mrs. Robert Harvey, of Roanoke County, and as a result of that union there were four children; namely, Mrs. Junior W. White, of Cave Spring; Mrs. Eliza B. Smith, of Roanoke; II. Clay Starkey, of Roanoke; and Joseph G. Starkey, who resides at the old homestead.\"Jack, George S., and Edward Boyle Jacobs. History of Roanoke County. [Roanoke, Va.]: [Stone], 1912. http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/6132439 During the Civil War, he served in the 5th Virginia Cavalry. He was wounded during the Seven Days Battles and had three horses shot out from underneath him during the war. ==Speedwell Plantation== After his marriage of Henrietta P. Harvey, he and his wife lived in Speedwell Plantation. The address is 6135 Merriman Rd., Cave Springs, VA. \"Speedwell\" was built by Colonel Lewis Speedwell Harvey (1785-1842). In 1819, he acquired a 7,000 acre tract in the south part of Roanoke County, Virginia. Harvey built a furnace for iron production near what is now the village of Starkey. As a result of the abundant supply of brown Hematite found in the area, the Harvey Furnace soon gained an excellent reputation for producing iron of very high quality. His house was completed in 1831. Soon after it was named for the English ship, the Speedwell, that according to family tradition brought Harvey's ancestors to America. \"Speedwell\", is a classic I-form Virginia house made of brick. Harvey's granddaughter, Henrietta Powers Harvey Starkey, contracted Gustave A. Sedon for remodeling work and to construct a Greek Revival porch and door case on the I-form in May 1877. The unusual door case at Speedwell is in the style of Sedon's work, who also worked on the 1849 Greek Revival home, Belle Aire, in Roanoke. The similarity between back porch columns on Hollins College's main dormitory (records show Sedon as the carpenter) and the front porch columns of Speedwell confirm his work on both.Whitwell, W. L., and Lee W. Winborne. The Architectural Heritage of the Roanoke Valley.

Established to facilitate the financial transactions of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad, the First National Bank subsequently followed a career that closely paralleled the growth of the city into the leading financial and industrial center of Southwest Virginia.\"United States Department of the Interior.
