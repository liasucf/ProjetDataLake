Hill denied allegations of a relationship with Kelly, saying that her estranged husband, whom she described as \"abusive\", was doing everything he could to humiliate her, and that her political opponents were exploiting a private matter for political gain. Her husband denied the allegations of abuse and Hill's subsequent marriage dissolution petition did not allege abuse nor wrongdoing. Hill reached out to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi to deny the allegations. RedState also published nude photos of Hill as part of the story.

The House Ethics Committee announced on October 23, 2019, that it would conduct an investigation into the allegation that Hill had an affair with a male staffer, which, if true, would be in violation of House ethics reforms that were implemented in 2018 in response to the #MeToo movement.

In her last speech before Congress on October 31, 2019, Hill said there was a \"double standard\" and \"misogynistic culture\" that resulted in her decision to step down from her position when faced with allegations of an improper relationship with a staff person. In the address to Congress she said, \"I'm leaving, but we have men who have been credibly accused of intentional acts of sexual violence and remain in boardrooms, on the Supreme Court, in this very body, and worst of all, in the Oval Office.\" She closed by saying, \"as my final act I voted to move forward with the impeachment of Donald Trump on behalf of the women of the United States of America.\" On December 7, 2019, Hill penned an op-ed in The New York Times in which she described the events that led to her decision to resign, and mentions that she was suicidal during that time period. In the special election held in the spring of 2020, Hill endorsed her longtime friend, State Assemblywoman Christy Smith, who ultimately lost the election. Hill, whose PAC contributed $200,000, said that Smith had been considered \"the mom of Democratic politics\" in the district for years, and that \"there's no one else that I could even think of that I would want to run for this.\" Some Democrats regretted Hill's involvement in the campaign.
