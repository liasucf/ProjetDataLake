(An earlier Dundas Road District had existed from 1895 to 1918 before amalgamating to form the Norseman district.) It was declared a shire and named the Shire of Dundas with effect from 1 July 1961 following the passage of the Local Government Act 1960, which reformed all remaining road districts into shires. ==Towns== * Norseman * Balladonia * Caiguna * Cocklebiddy * Dundas * Eucla * Madura * Mundrabilla * Princess Royal ==Notable councillors== * Emil Nulsen, Dundas Roads Board chairman 1929\u20131931; later a state MP ==See also== * Dundas, Western Australia ==References== ==External links== * Dundas Category:Nullarbor Plain Category:Norseman, Western Australia ",
