    "text": "Night Life is the sixth album by country western singer and guitarist Ray Price, backed by his regular touring band, the Cherokee Cowboys. The album was released in 1963 on the Columbia Records label.Prestige Records discography accessed March 8, 2013 The album was included in Robert Dimery's 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. ==Reception== Night Life was Ray Price's first LP to hit the charts. It was released in April, 1963, but Billboard didn't start publishing a Country Album chart until January, 1964. At that time, it was still selling well enough to appear and in the chart's second week, it was the number one album, the first of five to reach #1 during Price's career.Ultimate Twang review accessed July 8, 2015 Cub Koda in an Allmusic retrospective review felt that the album was \"the last gasp of true honky tonk, the first stab at mainstreaming it into the Nashville sound of the 1960s, or country music's first concept album\".Cub Koda Allmusic review accessed July 8, 2013 == Track listing == # \"Introduction and Theme / Night Life\" (Walt Breeland, Paul Buskirk, Willie Nelson) - 2:05 / 4:41 # \"Lonely Street\" (Carl Belew, Kenny Sowder, W.S.
