The meaning of its name in Chinese is \u201cUniversity Road\u201d, as it was first a road near West China Union University (; now the Huaxi District of Sichuan University; ) in 1910. ==Orientation== Daxue Road is located in the south of Chengdu, running a west\u2013east direction. It begins from South Renmin Road (\u4eba\u6c11\u5357\u8def) and continues eastward towards Hongxing Road (\u7ea2\u661f\u8def). The road is about long and wide. 116 phoenix trees (Stercuiia platanitolia) lining the street and divided it into 3 parts, 2 for pedestrian, 1 for cars. ==History== In the beginning of 20th Century In 1905, West China Union Middle School was established as a union intervention of the American Mutual Foreign Mission Society, the Friends' Foreign Mission Association of Great Britain and Ireland, the General Board of Missions of theMethodist Church of Canada, (later the United Church of Canada) and the Board of Foreign Missions of the Methodist Episcopal Church USA. Then West China Union University opened in 1910 under the same supervision and built according to the plans set out mainly by Fred Rowntree. The Daxue Road was one of the interior roads of the university at that time. Moreover, it was called \"Main road to city south gate\" and \"road to city east gate\" as the gateway road of the university to the city. On the north side of the street there were mainly dormitories of university students and staff accommodations of West China Union Middle School and on the south side were the teaching area of university. Along the street there are the Whiting Memorial Administration Building (), The Lamont Library and Harvard-Yenching Museum (), education offices(not existed today), Religious Room (not existed today) etc. After the foundation of the P.R. China to the 21st Century As the mushrooming of urban construction in Chengdu, in 1960, the newly planned South Renmin Road separated the university into two parts. And as the increasing of residence housings built in and around this district, Daxue Road, from an interior university road, gradually became a city street serving for all the citizens. In the 1990s, it was one of the major markets in Chengdu, named as \"Daxue Road Market ()\". Between every phoenix tree there was one or two stalls, strengthened to the pedestrian area. The total area of the market reached about 8,000 m2. During the night, there was night market, mobile stalls selling cheap food and small commodities everywhere. Pedestrians, bicycles and cars all went through in the center of the road. From 2006 to present Current Streetscape of Daxue Road, Chengdu (\u6210\u90fd\u5927\u5b66\u8def\u8857\u9053\u5373\u666f) In 2006, Chengdu government listed Daxue Road as one of the important reforming Culture Blocks. A new Market building was built and all the former venders had been asked to move in. Buildings along the street had been repainted. Brick walls enclosing the campus had been replaced by iron railings or hedges in order that people walking on the street could see the campus buildings. After this renewal, although on the ground floor of the buildings along this street are mostly small restaurants and groceries, Daxue Road became one of the main transportation roads west\u2013east orientation of Chengdu. ==Sightseeing== Along the street there are two buildings listed in the Heritage buildings in Chengdu in 2001. ; The Whiting Memorial Administration Building The Whiting Memorial Administration Building () was originally the studio of West China Union University ().
