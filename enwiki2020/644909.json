In the late 1990s, the company released a security product initially called Interpol and later branded SonicWALL, a dedicated hardware appliance with firewall and VPN software intended for the small-business market. As sales for the security appliances rapidly accelerated, the company exited the Apple add-on networking business and refocused exclusively as a network security company. In late 1999, the company changed its name from Sonic Systems to SonicWALL, Inc. to represent the shift to a network security company, and in November 1999 SonicWall went public with the symbol SNWL. In 2001, SonicWall upgraded its Global Management System (GMS) software to manage more VPN devices. Matthew T. Medeiros (formerly of Philips Components) became CEO in March 2003. SonicWall acquired a number of companies through the years, expanding its product line in the process. In 2005, SonicWall announced the acquisition of enKoo. In 2007, SonicWall announced the acquisition of Aventail Corporation. On July 23, 2010, SonicWall announced that it had completed its merger with affiliates of an investor group led by Thoma Bravo, LLC, which included the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan through its private investor department, Teachers' Private Capital.
