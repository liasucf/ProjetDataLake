He was the head coach of the Manly- Warringah Sea Eagles in the National Rugby League (NRL). A former Australia international and New South Wales State of Origin representative , he played during the 1990s and 2000s for the Illawarra Steelers before they merged to form the St George Illawarra Dragons, with whom he won the 2000 Dally M Medal. Barrett also had a two-season spell in the Super League with England's Wigan Warriors and was named in 2007's Super League Dream Team before finishing his career back in Australia with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. After co- coaching the St George Illawarra under 20s side and coaching the Country New South Wales rugby league team for four seasons Barrett started coaching in the NRL with the Sea Eagles. ==Background== Barrett was born in Temora, New South Wales on 18 November 1977. He is a cousin of Australian rules footballer Luke Breust, NRL footballer Liam Martin and Australian water polo player Anthony Martin. While attending St Gregory's College, Campbelltown, he played for the Australian Schoolboys team in 1995. ==Playing career== ===1990s=== Barrett started his professional career in the 1996 ARL season with the Illawarra Steelers. Within two years he had been selected to play his first State of Origin match. Barrett was the stand-out player of the 1998 Illawarra Steelers season, top scoring with 18 tries and winning the BHP Medal as player of the year. His first season at the new joint-venture of the St. George Illawarra Dragons was marred by controversy as the incessant media hype over an alleged feud with Anthony Mundine and whether by playing out of position at half-back was affecting his form. He played at halfback in the Dragons' 1999 NRL Grand Final loss to Melbourne. ===2000s=== With the shock departure of Mundine from the Dragons in 2000, Barrett was allowed to move back to his original position of and he received the Dally M Medal in 2000. At the end of the 2001 NRL season, he went on the 2001 Kangaroo tour. In 2003, while Barrett was captain of St George Illawarra, Nathan Brown who was the coach at the time famously slapped Barrett across the face in a tense sideline spray alongside Lance Thompson. Brown admitted many years later it was one of the biggest regrets in his coaching career but said he had moved on from the incident.https://wwos.nine.com.au/2016/04/18/19/18/nathan-brown-admits-trent- barrett-slap-was-biggest-regret-of-his-career Barrett made history during the 2005 Tri-Nations by becoming the first-ever Kangaroo to be sin-binned twice in one match. He was sin-binned in the first half for what he claimed was a 'nothing' incident, and was dismissed in the 70th minute for illegally tackling a Great Britain player on his way to the tryline. The Kangaroos won the match 26\u201314. Following a Round 12, 2006 game against the Newcastle Knights, Barrett received a grade-five striking charge on Newcastle Knights's Brian Carney. The incident initially went unnoticed throughout the entire weekend but it is understood a Channel Nine producer picked up the incident. Barrett was suspended for six matches, ruling him out of Dally M Medal contention. Barrett playing for Wigan in 2008 Barrett had two years left on his St George Illawarra Dragons contract, but a get-out clause enabled him to quit the club for a move to England. He signed a three-year deal with the Wigan Warriors on 4 May 2006, despite their position at the bottom of the Super League and the threat of relegation to National League Division 1. Barrett made his Wigan Warriors d\u00e9but in a 16\u201310 defeat against Warrington at the JJB Stadium on 9 February 2007. In October 2007, Barrett was named as the Rugby League Players' Player of the Year but missed out on the \"Man of Steel\" although he had been tipped to be named. James Roby of St. Helens received the award. Barrett playing for the Sharks in 2010 Following a release from the final year of his three-year contract with Wigan, Barrett signed with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in June 2008, on a two-year deal, commencing in 2009. He earned the five-eighth spot for the New South Wales team in the 2nd State of Origin match that year. In his Origin comeback, Barrett was charged following a reckless tackle on Queensland's Greg Inglis, and as a result was suspended for two club matches. It did not, however, deter him from playing in the third and final Origin match in which he set up several tries as NSW defeated Queensland in the dead rubber, Queensland having won the series with victory three weeks prior. Barrett announced his retirement on 22 July 2010. ===Statistics=== ==== Representative games ==== *\"Club:\" Played 199 games for the Illawarra Steelers and the St George Illawarra Dragons *Country: Played for Country in City vs Country Origin *State of Origin: Played 11 games in total for New South Wales *International: Played 13 tests to date for Australia including the 2000 World Cup ==== Awards ==== *Dally M: Dally M Player of the Year in 2000 * Super League Players' Player of the Year 2007 ==Post-playing== After retiring from playing, Barrett worked as a commentator on television show NRL Daily and was assistant coach for New South Wales Rugby League Team.

In 2016, Trent Barrett became the head coach for Manly Warringah Sea Eagles. In Barrett's first season as Manly coach the club finished 13th on the table and missed the finals. The following season, Barrett took Manly to a 6th place finish on the table and qualified for the finals but were eliminated in controversial circumstances against Penrith in week one of the finals. In 2018, Manly and Barrett suffered a horror year on and off the field with the club finishing second last and narrowly avoiding the wooden spoon. The club was also plagued with infighting and there were reported disagreements between Barrett and the Manly owners over lack of chairs and whose responsibility it was to provide them. Trent eventually supplied the chairs himself but the effort was too late to save the season.https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl- premiership/manly-want-trent-barrett-to-serve-12-month-notice-until-july/news- story/a9030fef2f70c78b52fa807805b66a9a On 22 October 2018, Manly announced that former two-time premiership-winning coach Des Hasler would be appointed as the new Manly head coach for 2019 despite the fact that Barrett still had 12 months remaining on his contract and was not officially terminated by the club.https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/teams/sea-eagles/what- about-trent-barrett-five-burning-questions-for-des-haslers-sea-eagles/news- story/9800324bdf97b4718e2b43f3c04427d9 On 6 August 2019, Barrett spoke to the media and said that in some way he deserved credit for Manly's form reversal in 2019 which saw the club go from finishing second last in 2018 to contenders the following season. Barrett said \u201cI\u2019d actually like to think I left them well-educated, A few of the boys I got there like Siro (Curtis Sironen) were coming out of reserve grade, No one else wanted Moses Suli. He\u2019d been punted by the Wests Tigers and the Bulldogs, Tommy Turbo had only played five games when I started\". Barrett's comments were later slammed online by the daughter of Bob Fulton, Kirstie Fulton took to Facebook and wrote \u201cHistory will not be rewritten, no way. I sit back and watch and read people take credit for many things and it\u2019s hard to digest at times because I know who has been and continues to be instrumental in driving a lot of the change behind the scenes but I won\u2019t accept this at all. Is he kidding? His arrogance and ego nearly tore the place apart\". On August 16, 2019, it was announced that Barrett would be returning to Penrith as assistant coach to Ivan Cleary beginning in 2020. On 23rd July 2020, it was announced that Barrett would be the head coach of Canterbury-Bankstown from 2021 onwards on a 3 year deal. ==Footnotes== ==External links== *Manly Sea Eagles profile *NRL profile * Trent Barrett Wigan Career Page on the Wigan RL Fansite. * Super League profile * 2001 Ashes profile * State of Origin Official website Rugby League Player Stats Category:1977 births Category:Rugby league players from New South Wales Category:Rugby league five-eighths Category:Illawarra Steelers players Category:Australia national rugby league team players Category:St. George Illawarra Dragons players Category:Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks players Category:Wigan Warriors players Category:New South Wales Rugby League State of Origin captains Category:Country New South Wales Origin rugby league team players Category:New South Wales Rugby League State of Origin players Category:Australian rugby league coaches Category:Country New South Wales rugby league team coaches Category:Manly Warringah Sea Eagles coaches Category:Living people ",
