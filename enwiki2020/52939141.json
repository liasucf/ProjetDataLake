He was also affectionately called Baba-e-Filmi Sahafat (Pioneer of Film Journalism) in Pakistan. His son, Aslam Ilyas Rashidi temporarily suspended the annual awarding of Nigar Awards from 2005 to 2012 due to a then ongoing decline in Pakistani film industry during that period. In 2012, Aslam Ilyas Rashidi announced plans to revive the Nigar Awards for films and stated that this time it would also include awards for the Pakistani television industry. ==References== Category:1997 deaths Category:Pakistani magazine founders Category:Pakistani publishers (people) Category:Pakistani magazine editors Category:People from Karachi Category:Journalists from Sindh Category:Pakistani male journalists Category:Year of birth missing ",
