As the band leader, St. Nicholas hired East Prussian-born front man John Kay when Jack London left The Sparrows, and they became Sparrow. He moved the band south to New York for a modest record deal with Columbia Records, then drove Sparrow non-stop to California. St. Nicholas was one of the driving forces in music of the hippie counterculture movement, the Summer of Love.
