He also started to greatly improve the economy of the colony: in those years indeed it was started the Italian colonization of the area of Genale, in southern Somalia, forming a group of small and medium-sized farms. Most settlers consisted of old fascist militants of Turin. The first informal association between farmers, however, arose only in 1928, promoted by Corni.Italian emigration in Somalia; pag. 11 (in Italian) The main crop of the area was cotton and was done by small farms owned by those Italian settlers: about one hundred with an area varying between 75 and 600 hectares (with an average that oscillated about 200) with a total area of about 20,000 hectares. At least until 1931 the cotton was the main crop, later replaced by the banana production,Banana harvest in Genale whose harvest was sold to the Italian State, that did the marketing in Italy as a monopoly. In March 1946 died near Genova. ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * Bartolacelli, Giuliano and Enzo. Un imprenditore modenese. Fermo Corni e il castello di Monfestino.
