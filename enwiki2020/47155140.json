Tamburawa Water Treatment Plant has the capacity to deliver 150 million litres of potable water per day to the city of Kano and surrounding areas. The raw water is sourced from the Kano River, and treated using conventional treatment processes to produce potable water that readily exceeds World Health Organisation\u2019s minimum requirements for drinking water. The multi-billion project was accomplished by COSTAIN Construction Company, which provided employment opportunity to the people of Tamburawa because of the availability of labour. Pfizer in 2009 reached a separate $75 million settlement with Kano State government to compensate victims of the experimental antibiotic Trovan on children during a meningitis outbreak without receiving adequate prior consent. Following the choice of the Kano State Government, and provision of land by the state government, the board commenced work on construction of a Diagnostic and Disease Control Centre in Tamburawa, Kano State in 2010. The over $25.5 million (4.4 billion Naira) facility sits on 9.6 hectares of land with a built-up area of approximately 2.9 hectares. The health facility, which has been completed and fully equipped, is already handed over to the Kano State government. The centre contains various facilities including: public health laboratory, micro biological reference laboratory, diagnostic centre, 100 beds patient ward facility, ultra-modern kitchen and dining facility, staff quarters and mortuary Gains for Kano. The state-of-the-art medical facility is a unique medical facility that has the potential to uplift health care in Kano in particular and Nigeria in general. It provides facilities for the training of medical doctors and other key health care professionals in the country. It houses special facilities for conducting research for infectious diseases such as malaria, cholera, poliomyelitis and meningitis among others. The DDCC has facilities to quarantine patients during epidemic outbreak just like the recent Ebola outbreak. Experts said the facility will assist medical personnel in tracking individual strains of causative agents and diseases so as to determine the required medication. The facility which has a functional public health laboratory to conduct research into other aspects of medicine bordering on public safety will as well boost research efforts in Nigeria. The Medical Centre currently employs security men, gardeners and artisans from the local population.
