    "text": "New Swears is a four-piece Canadian band consisting of Sammy J. Scorpion, Beej Eh, Nick Nofun, Stoney and S-Mike. Their music has been classified as garage punk or power pop. == History == New Swears was formed in 2012 in Ottawa, Ontario at the Fun Boy Club House, where the band lived. New Swears are composed of brothers Beej Eh and Sammy J. Scorpion, with Nick Nofun, and Scru Bar. The band released its first LP, Funny Isn't Real, in 2013 on cassette under Bruised Tongue Records and released it on vinyl shortly thereafter through Dirt Cult Records and Bachelor Records. Their second album, Junkfood Forever, Bedtime Whatever (reviews), was released in 2014 under Bachelor Records and later under Dirt Cult Records. New Swears signed with Dine Alone Records on October 7, 2016 and in that same month released as singles, Brand New Spot and Sugar Heavy Metal on 7\" vinyl and digital formats under Dine Alone Records. Their third full-length LP, And the Magic of Horses (reviews ), was released in June 2017 under Dine Alone Records. New Swears released two singles, \"Illuminati Knights\" and \"Happy Birthday\" under Dine Alone Records in December 2017. All proceeds from the sale of the tracks went towards For Pivots Sake and Girls + Skate 613 in support of access to skateboarding for the youth of Ottawa. In 2018 there were a few changes to the bands structure with Scru Bar leaving the band. Sammy J. Scorpion took his place as co-guitar player with his brother Beej Eh. Nick Nofun moved from the drums to replace Sammy on the bass and Stoney stepped up as the new member, and locally experienced drummer. S-Mike provided added sound on occasion as keyboard player. On March 28, 2019 Pure Grain Audio leaked the song and music video for their new single \"Angel\". On April 18, 2919 Dine Alone Records announced the date of release of their newest album, \"Night Mirror\", on June 13, 2019 and made available two singles from the album, \"Bon Voyage\" and \"Rolling Stone\". ==Live Performances== The band completed their first tour of Europe in the fall of 2014. In 2015 the New Swears performed at the Ottawa Bluesfest (reviews). They also performed at the Arboretum Festival, Maker Space North, and Ottawa Explosion. In June 2017, under Dine Alone Records, they embarked on a tour across Canada and the US as well as a three-week tour over to Europe in the Fall of 2017. The band continued touring Canada through 2018 with a string of shows on their way to an appearance at Elora Riverfest. The band is well known for their energetic live shows that has traditionally involved confetti cannons, silly string, costumes, wigs and other party props. The band members have been known to assemble into human pyramids on stage without missing a beat. ==Current Band members== *Sammy J.
