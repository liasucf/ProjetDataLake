The Diocese of Banks and Torres is one of the nine current dioceses of the Anglican Church of Melanesia. Founded on 12 May 1996 and currently made up of thirteen islands, divided into three regions and sixteen districts (parishes), the diocese was the first from which indigenous Melanesians were ordained into the priesthood. Veverao, on Mota, was the first Christian village established, and the Mota language was used by the first Christian missions to Melanesia. The Mass was first celebrated there by John Patteson. ==List of bishops== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 95%;\" |- ! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #7F1734; color: white;\" | Bishops of Banks and Torres |- ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 8%;\" | From ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 8%;\" | Until ! style=\"background- color: #D4B1BB; width: 33%;\" | Incumbent ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 46%;\" | Notes |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1996 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2000 | Charles Ling | First bishop; consecrated and installed at the inauguration of the Diocese on 12 May 1996.List of small publications in the Archives of the Anglican Church of Melanesia (in the National Archives of Solomon Islands) p. 20.
