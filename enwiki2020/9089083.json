    "text": "Because of its pivotal role in European and world history, the Battle of Waterloo has a prominent place in military history and is frequently mentioned in popular culture and the arts. == Idiom == The phrase \"to meet your Waterloo\" or some variation thereof, has entered the English language as a phrase signifying a great test with a final and decisive outcome, generally one resulting in failure and exposing vulnerability in something or someone who had, before then, seemed unbeatable. === Examples of usage === *In the film The Living Daylights, arms dealer Brad Whitaker (Joe Don Baker) stalks James Bond (Timothy Dalton) through a military museum in his home, wearing seemingly impenetrable body armor and carrying an assault rifle that easily outguns Bond's pistol. Bond ambushes him with a bomb concealed behind a bust of Wellington, which knocks Whitaker down over a scale model of the Battle of Waterloo. Bond later remarks, over Whittaker's dead body, \"He met his Waterloo.\" *Jim DeMint, a Republican United States Senator of South Carolina, made a well-publicized comment during a conference call with conservative activists on July 17, 2009 in which he encouraged conservatives to go after President Barack Obama's Health Care Reform efforts, saying \"[i]f we're able to stop Obama on this, it will be his Waterloo. It will break him.\"Waterloo Or Verdun? July 22, 2009 In response, DeMint's Facebook fan page was spammed with hundreds of postings of the link to the YouTube video of Abba's Waterloo. After the passage of the health care reform bill, conservative pundit David Frum criticized the opposition strategy exemplified by DeMint's comment, saying, \"it\u2019s Waterloo all right: ours.\" Some liberal commentators claimed that it was his Waterloo, as DeMint predicted, but that Obama played the role of Wellington rather than Napoleon. ==Commemorative memorials and places== :For a comprehensive list of places named Waterloo see Waterloo (disambiguation). There are many memorials and places named after the battle; perhaps the most famous is Waterloo station in London. In the 1990s, after Waterloo station was chosen as the British terminus for the Eurostar train service, Florent Longuep\u00e9e, a municipal councillor in Paris, wrote to the British Prime Minister requesting that the station be renamed, because he said it was upsetting for the French to be reminded of Napoleon's defeat when they arrived in London by Eurostar.UK Waterloo insult to French visitors BBC News website November 6, 1998 ==Books== ===Fiction=== *Clarke, Susanna: Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is a fantasy novel in which the battle of Waterloo is described from the point of view of a magician who aids the Duke of Wellington.

Sharpe's Waterloo or Waterloo: Sharpe's Final Adventure Campaign is a novel which sets Cornwell's fictional hero Richard Sharpe at the battle on the staff of the non-fictional Prince of Orange.

The chapter consists of two short stories which were originally published separately. Project Gutenberg:The Adventures of Gerard (Audio Book) * Gilbert, William Schwenck: In his burlesque \"La Viviandi\u00e8re\" (1868) Gilbert pillories the bad manners of English tourists in France when Lord Pentonville says: \"When Frenchmen have conversed with me or you, We've always turned the talk to Waterloo.\"W.S. Gilbert: His Life and Letters *Goscinny, Ren\u00e9 (stories) and Uderzo, Albert (illustrations), Asterix in Belgium: The entire battle between Julius Caesar and the Belgians in Asterix in Belgium is a parody of the battle of Waterloo. The arrival of Caesar and his troops resembles a similar painting depicting Napoleon and his army. In the French version, the text which accompanies the battle on paper is a parody of Victor Hugo's poem about the Battle of Waterloo. Asterix, Obelix and Vitalstatistix lead a surprise attack on Caesar's troops just when the Romans seem to win the battle. This is of course, exactly what happened to Napoleon in Waterloo. * Graham, Winston. The Twisted Sword. This novel, the penultimate book in the Poldark series, deals extensively with the fictional Poldark family members' involvement in Waterloo. *The Battle of Waterloo is covered in some detail from the viewpoint of the fictional Morland family in The Campaigners, Volume 14 of The Morland Dynasty, a series of historical novels by author Cynthia Harrod-Eagles. * Heyer, Georgette.

There are so many critical turning points in the battle, it's explained, that a time traveler would have many opportunities to affect the outcome. Oddly - whether by accident or design - Willis consistently refers to the battle as taking place on 18 June 1814, precisely one year earlier than it did. ===Nonfiction=== *Creasy, Edward Shepherd.
