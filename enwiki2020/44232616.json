Indha Rajagopal, the author of \"The Glass Ceiling in the Vertical Mosaic: Indian Immigrants to Canada,\" analyzed the 1986 Census of Canada. She concluded that in Toronto Indo-Canadians had salaries lower than other people in Toronto, including native-born persons and people who immigrated. Rajagopal stated that credentials obtained from institutions abroad were possibly not being recognized in Canada, so even though Ontario Indo-Canadians had higher likelihoods of completing university studies than the general population, the Indo-Canadians were unable to get higher income levels.Li, Peter S. \"The Market Value and Social Value of Race\" (Chapter 1). In: Kwok, Siu-ming and Maria A. Wallis (editors). Daily Struggles: The Deepening Racialization and Feminization of Poverty in Canada. Canadian Scholars\u2019 Press, 2008. , 9781551303390. Start: 21.

In 1990 Bruce Ally, the author of an article about Indo-Guyanese in Toronto, wrote that they were \"relative newcomers\".Ally, p. 20 (Archive). When Indo-Guyanese first arrived, many of them did not find advantageous work, despite having high levels of education and skills, due to a lack of credentials, a need for adaptation to Canadian society, and racism from existing Canadians. Many of them lived in cramped dwellings and this forced elders into retirement houses; in Guyana the housing spaces are larger and accommodate entire extended families. In addition many Indo-Guyanese who first settled Toronto lived in neighbourhoods far away from worship centres, and those centres were often not majority Indo-Guyanese and did sermons in languages not understood by Indo-Guyanese.Ally, p. 18 (Archive). As of 1990 many Indo-Guyanese were underpaid in relation to their qualifications and skills, and compared with their political situation in their homeland they had not achieved as much political power by 1990. Indo- Guyanese students attended university at rates higher than the Canadian average due to pressure from parents and a cultural commitment to education, although the people had reduced enthusiasm for achieving this education.Ally, p. 19 (Archive). ===Maharashtrians=== As of that year most Maharahstrians worked as professionals, although there were others doing other occupations.Wagle, p. 23 (Archive). Those who worked as professionals generally belonged to higher castes, such as Brahmins, Marathas, and Kayasthas.Wagle, p. 24 (Archive) ===Sri Lankans=== A wave of Sri Lankans arrived in Toronto from 1970 to 1975. ==Language== Punjabi was historically the most common Indian language among South Asians in Toronto. As immigration from other South Asian countries increased coupled with an increase of immigration from other regions within India, the percentage of Punjabi speakers out of the total South Asian population declined. Today, Urdu, Punjabi and Tamil are the three most spoken languages in Toronto's South Asian community, while Gujarati and Marathi are the fastest-growing. ==Media== Channel Punjabi programs are broadcast in the Toronto area. In 1980 there Toronto area had several Indo-Pakistani language periodicals, including two in Gujarati and one each in Hindi and Urdu. At that time the Toronto area had no Punjabi periodicals.Johnston, Hugh. 1988. \u201cThe Development of Punjabi Community in Vancouver since 1961\u201d.

Ram Mulgund, an actuary in a Canadian insurance company who served as the president of Brihan Maharashtra Mandal (BMM), stated that the high level of education of Maharashtrian women meant that they were the primary persons operating the Marathi Bhashik Mandal. ==Commerce== In 2012 Dakshana Bascaramurty of The Globe and Mail wrote that the popularity of ethnic shopping centres declined and that many Indo-Canadians are preferring to go to mainstream retailers. Because the prices of saris and salwar kameezes are higher in Toronto than in India and South Asia, many prefer to travel to South Asia to buy the clothing items.Bascaramurty, Daksha. \"The rise and fall of the ethnic mall.\" The Globe and Mail.

It operated on Sundays with each class lasting two to three hours. It used Balabharati, Marathi texts from India, as instructional materials due to a lack of English-medium teaching materials. At the time the school had classes of five students each. A Canadian federal grant supported this program from 1978 to 1989. ==Legacy== There is a large statue of Mohandas Gandhi in Shanti Uddyan on Yonge Street. ==Notable residents== * Vasu Chanchlani * Aditya Jha * Deepa MehtaWaugh, Thomas.
