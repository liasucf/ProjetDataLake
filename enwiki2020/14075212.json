    "text": "Sir Herbert Lloyd, 1st Baronet (22 July 1720 \u2013 19 August 1769) was a Welsh politician. Lloyd was born in Llanddewibrefi and educated at Jesus College, Oxford. His father, Walter Lloyd of Voelallt, Cardiganshire, was attorney- general for south Wales and was succeeded by Herbert's elder brother, John Lloyd. Herbert Lloyd also trained as a lawyer, and was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1742. In 1761 he became MP for Cardigan Boroughs, and in 1763 he was created a baronet. His later years were marked by increasing debt, the loss of his parliamentary seat and poor health. He died en route to Bath; there is no foundation for the tradition that he committed suicide. Although he was married twice, he left no heir. ==Sources== *Dictionary of Welsh Biography Online Category:1720 births Category:1769 deaths Category:Alumni of Jesus College, Oxford Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of Great Britain Category:Members of the Inner Temple Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for Welsh constituencies Category:British MPs 1761\u20131768 ",
