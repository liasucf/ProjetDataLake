The awards were distributed each August and photographs and biographies of the inductees were placed in City Hall to inspire others to aim for excellence. August was chosen to commemorate the passage of the 19th Amendment, which occurred on August 26, 1920. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:98%\" |+Chicago Women's Hall of Fame Inductees |- ! scope=\"col\" width=\"25%\" | Name ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" width=\"5%\" | Image ! scope=\"col\" width=\"10%\" | Birth\u2013Death ! scope=\"col\" width=\"5%\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" width=\"10%\" |Area of achievement |- | |100px |(1860\u20131935) |1988 |Social Reform |- | | | |1989 |Business |- | | | |1991 |Health |- | | |(1928\u20132015) |1991 |Arts |- | | | |1990 |Religion |- | | |(1915\u20132010) |1989 | |- | | | |1988 | |- |Dr. Effie Ellis | |(1913\u20131994) |1989 | |- | | | | |Business |- | | | |1989 |Education |- | | | |1989 |Government |- | | |(1932\u2013 |1989 | |- | scope=\"row\" | http://www.athe.org/associations/12588/files/ATHE_25th_FINAL_7.29.2011.pdf ||https://theatre.depaul.edu/about/faculty-and- staff/emeritus/PublishingImages/Bella%20Itkin.jpg ||(1920\u20132011) || 1990 || Arts and literature |- | | |(1915\u20131999) | |Nursing/Native American advocacy |- | | | |1990 |Health |- | | | |1990 |Education |- | | | |1989 |Civic development |- | | | |1989 |Communications |- | | | |1989 |Social Services |- | | | |1989 |Women's Rights Advocacy |- | | | |1990 |Government |- | | | |1990 |Social services |- | | | |1990 |Business |- | | | | |Labor |- | | | |1990 |Law |- | | | |1989 |Law |- | | | |1990 |Civic |- | | | |1990 |Communications / Media |- | | | | |Labor |- | | | | | |- | | | |1990 |Women's rights |- | | |(1922\u20132016) |1989 |Labor |- | |100px |(1862\u20131931) |1988 |African-American activist. |- | | | |1990 |Labor |- | | | |1990 |Military |- |} == References == == External links == *Mollie West at Induction Ceremony Category:Women's halls of fame Category:1988 establishments in Illinois Category:Halls of fame in Illinois ",
