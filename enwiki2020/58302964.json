Like many of her class, she was not named and is properly referred to by her hull designation. == Construction == LST-39 was laid down on 23 April 1943, at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania by the Dravo Corporation; launched on 29 July 1943; sponsored by Mrs. L. A. Mertz; and commissioned on 8 September 1943. == Service history == During World War II, LST-39 was assigned to the Asiatic-Pacific theater, but saw no combat action. She sank 21 May 1944, as part of the West Loch disaster and she was struck from the Navy list on 18 July 1944. YF-1079 beached and damaged in Buckner Bay, Okinawa, after Typhoon Louise ravaged that port in October 1945. Photographed in November 1945. The image shows the after portion of her starboard side, which was damaged by a collision with another YF during the storm. Another service craft, possibly YF-757, lies sunken to the left. She was later refloated, converted to a spare parts issue barge, and redesignated YF-1079. In early October 1945, YF-1079 was in Buckner Bay, when typhoon Louise passed over. She was one of over 200 US military vessels to be grounded or severely damaged. During the storm she was struck by another ship, severely damaging her starboard side. She was again struck from the Navy list 25 February 1946, and destroyed August 1946. == See also == * List of United States Navy ships * Landing craft * List of United States Navy LSTs == References == == Bibliography == * * * Category:World War II amphibious warfare vessels of the United States Category:Ships built in Pittsburgh Category:1943 ships Category:LST-1-class tank landing ships of the United States Navy Category:Maritime incidents in May 1944 Category:Maritime incidents in October 1945 Category:Ships sunk by non-combat internal explosions Category:Ships built by Dravo Corporation ",
