    "text": "SC Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster (English: Prussia M\u00fcnster) is a German sports club based in M\u00fcnster, North Rhine-Westphalia which is mostly recognised for its football section. The football team currently plays in Regionalliga West which is the fourth tier in German football. Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster also fields teams in tennis, athletics, handball and fistball. ==History== The club was founded as FC Preu\u00dfen on 30 April 1906 and has its roots in a group formed at the Johann- Conrad-Schlaun Grammar School. Historians consider patriotic reasons for naming the club after Prussia. At first the club did not have its own ground and was playing at a parade ground of the army at Loddenheide. General Baron von Bissing gave permission only if the goals would be taken down again after training. On 24 June 1907 the Eagles won their first game against FC Osnabr\u00fcck with 5\u20130. After successfully applying for the Western German League system, the team initially competed in the second tier. In 1908 the Eagles were promoted to the first league and in 1914 they won the Westphalian Championship. Between 1916 and 1926 the club played on M\u00fcnstermannplatz, which was close to the current ground, the Preu\u00dfenstadion. In 1921 they won the Championship a second time and also took on their current name.Dahlkamp, Hubert; Schulze-Marmeling, Dietrich (2006). 100 Jahre Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster. G\u00f6ttingen: Die Werkstatt GmbH. S. 13\u201330. . In 1933, Preu\u00dfen advanced to the Gauliga Westfalen, one of sixteen top-flight leagues established through the re-organization of German football under the Third Reich. They earned only mediocre results there and were relegated twice. Their second demotion in 1941 left them out of first division football until after World War II. Historical chart of Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster league performance after WWII The team played three seasons in the Landesliga Westfalen Gr. 2 (II) before returning to the top- flight in the Oberliga West in the 1948\u201349 season. That arrival was accompanied by some notoriety, as Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster became the first German football club to build a team by buying players, something previously unheard of in a country committed to the ideal of amateurism. Siegfried Rachuba, Adolf Preissler, Rudolf Schulz, Felix Gerritzen, and Josef Lammers formed a front five dubbed by the press as the \"Hundred-Thousand-Mark Line\", even though that much money never did change hands. Rachuba is still M\u00fcnsters most successful first tier striker of all times with 97 goals in 238 games. The investment paid dividends as the club appeared in the 1951 national final in front of 107,000 spectators at Berlin's Olympic Stadium against 1. FC Kaiserslautern. Preu\u00dfen striker Gerritzen scored first but the team lost after two goals from Ottmar Walter.Dahlkamp, Hubert; Schulze-Marmeling, Dietrich (2006). 100 Jahre Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster. G\u00f6ttingen: Die Werkstatt GmbH. S. 65\u201378. . ===Founding member of the Bundesliga=== Their results as a mid-table side in the tough Oberliga West in the ten years prior to the formation of the Bundesliga in 1963 were good enough to earn Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster the admission as one of the five teams from that league to earn a place in Germany's new sixteen-team professional circuit. The club made only a cameo appearance in the Bundesliga, being relegated after a next-to-last 15th-place finish. ===Post Bundesliga play=== Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster played out the 1960s and 1970s as a second division side in the Regionalliga West and 2. Bundesliga Nord. In the 1970s the Preu\u00dfen made several attempts to return to Bundesliga. Under club president G\u00fcnter Wellerdieck (from 1970 to 1978) the club took a considerable financial risk to achieve the promotion to first tier. Preu\u00dfen failed to do so by finishing on 5th place in the 1973\u201374 season and on 3rd place in the 1977\u201378 and 1978\u201379 seasons. After Wellerdieck and other staff of the club's management resigned due to financial difficulties and accusations of tax fraud in 1978, the decline of Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster continued. They slipped to the Amateur Oberliga Westfalen (III) in the 1981\u201382 season, and except for a short adventure in the 2. Bundesliga in the 1990 and 1991 seasons, played third tier football in the Regionalliga West/Sudwest (1993\u20132000) and Regionalliga Nord until 2006. During this period, they captured the German Amateur Championship in 1994 with a 1\u20130 win over Kickers Offenbach. In 2006, the club was relegated to the Oberliga Westfalen, now a fourth tier circuit. Management subsequently invested significant financial resources into a high-profile team of experienced second- and third-tier players in pursuit of immediate re-promotion. The attempt ended in failure and the club re-built itself with young players in place of expensive veterans and also put in place a young and relatively unknown coach, Roger Schmidt. The re-worked side finished in first place in the 2007\u201308 season, and so qualified for the new Regionalliga West which replaced the Oberliga in the league system. They ended the season in fourth place in the Regionalliga in 2008\u201309, and in sixth in 2009\u201310. For season 2008\u201309 the club qualified for the DFB-Pokal the first time since season 1997\u201398 (where they were defeated by 1.FSV Mainz 05). The opponent was VfL Bochum which competed in Bundesliga at that time. After a penalty shootout Preu\u00dfen lost 5\u20136. In the following year the Eagles were defeated in the extra time against another first tier team, Hertha BSC. The match ended 1\u20133. 111-year anniversary logo used in 2017 They were finally promoted to 3. Liga after finishing as champions of the West Group of the Regionalliga in the 2010\u201311 season. The manager of that time was Marc Fascher. Preu\u00dfen were defeated by another Bundesliga team in the German cup, VfL Wolfsburg (1\u20132). The first season 2011\u201312 in the third tier of German football after five years ended with a 12th place. In the following seasons the team finished significantly better and even had chances to get promoted again to 2. Bundesliga. In season 2012\u201313 they almost succeeded and ended in fourth place. In that season the team was also able to defeat the Bundesliga team Werder Bremen in the first round of the DFB-Pokal, 4\u20132 after extra time. In the second round the club lost against FC Augsburg. In season 2013\u201314 they ended in sixth place. Again the club managed to win against a team from a higher league in the DFB-Pokal, FC St. Pauli from 2. Bundesliga. In the next round Preu\u00dfen was defeated again by FC Augsburg. In the 2014\u201315 season, the club had a promising start, and was during winter even at the top of the league. Unfortunately the team was not able to keep up the good results and finished 8th. The season 2015\u201316 also started with good results, but again the team lost ground in the long turn and finished ninth. During the season the club switched managers, from Ralf Loose to Horst Steffen. The following season brought up big changes in the club administration. After changing the coach from Horst Steffen to the former SCP-player Benno M\u00f6hlmann several high ranking positions in the club were also manned with new personalities. To serve as chairman Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster could win over Christoph Str\u00e4sser, a former politician of the German Bundestag. Among others, the board of directors now contains Walther Seinsch who is well known in German football for his work with then fourth tier club FC Augsburg. Furthermore, with Friedrich Lucas the club's board now has a fans' representative for the first time in the history of Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster. In April 2017, Malte Metzelder manned the position of director of football. He is also a former player of the Eagles. In 2017, Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster celebrated the club's 111th anniversary. In celebration, the club used a special anniversary logo in 2017. The logo contained the text \"111 Jahre\" (111 years) on top and \"1906\u20132017\" on the bottom, along with the club's usual Prussian eagle surrounded by a wreath. The club also gave away 111 litres of free beer to fans at the stadium. ==Honours== The club's honours: * German championship ** Runners-up: 1951 * German amateur championship ** Champions: 1994 * Regionalliga West (IV) ** Champions: 2011 * Amateur Oberliga Westfalen (III) ** Champions: 1988, 1989, 1992, 1993 * Westphalia Cup ** Winner: 1997, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2014 ** Runners-up: 1987, 1998, 2012 ==Players== ===Current squad=== ==Staff== * Manager: Sascha Hildmann * Assistant manager: Louis Cordes * Goalkeeping coach: Milenko Gilic * Director of sport: Malte Metzelder * Scout: Harald Menzel * Kit manager: J\u00fcrgen Keseberg ==Manager history== * Season 1948\u201349 Rudolf Prokoph * Season 1949\u201350 Willi Multhaup * Season 1950\u201351 Willi Multhaup * Season 1951\u201352 Willi Multhaup * Season 1952\u201353 Willi Multhaup * Season 1953\u201354 Ludwig Tretter * Season 1954\u201355 Paul B\u00f6hm * Season 1955\u201356 Paul B\u00f6hm * Season 1956\u201357 G\u00fcnter Hentschke * Season 1957\u201358 G\u00fcnter Hentschke * Season 1958\u201359 Kuno Kl\u00f6tzer * Season 1959\u201360 Kuno Kl\u00f6tzer * Season 1960\u201361 Kuno Kl\u00f6tzer * Season 1961\u201362 Richard Schneider * Season 1962\u201363 Richard Schneider * Season 1963\u201364 Richard Schneider * Season 1964\u201365 Richard Schneider * Season 1965\u201366 Richard Schneider * Season 1966\u201367 Povoslav Mihailovic * Season 1967\u201368 Bernhard \"Bert\" Trautmann * Season 1968\u201369 Bernhard \"Bert\" Trautmann \u2013 from 17 September 1968 Rudolf Schnippe \u2013 from 31 December 1968 Richard Schneider * Season 1969\u201370 Richard Schneider \u2013 Dagmar Drewes * Season 1970\u201371 Richard Schneider \u2013 Falk D\u00f6rr \u2013 from 11 December 1970 Alfred Schmidt * Season 1971\u201372 Alfred Schmidt * Season 1972\u201373 Slobodan Cendic * Season 1973\u201374 Slobodan Cendic \u2013 from 18 March 1974 Bernd Kipp and G\u00fcnter Wellerdieck * Season 1974\u201375 Werner Olk \u2013 from 1.

Once considered one of the most modern stadiums in Germany, the arena slowly fell into disrepair which resulted in reducing the capacity from 40,000 in the 1950s to the current 15,000. Construction of a new facility was considered in the 80s, but the idea was abandoned in December 2000. In spring 2008 it was decided to renovate, to make the stadium more attractive and fitting to modern standards. The seating area was replaced by a new one including 2,931 seats and VIP lounges. Some of the terraces which were still uncovered got a roof. The works finished in May 2009. Further plans have been brought up to continue to modernize the stadium and actions were taken in 2014 to change the development plan of the stadium area by the local administration. Results are pending but in the end, the club wants to rebuild the western and eastern stand to give spectators more comfort and make the club more competitive financially. Furthermore, the Eagles want to extend training possibilities for the professional team and the junior teams. ==Fans== Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster fans in 2006 Due to the club's promotion from Regionalliga West to 3. Liga, average attendance significantly. During its years in fourth tier of the German league system, the average crowd never exceeded 4,500 fans, with the exception of the 2010\u201311 season, during which the club was promoted, with an average attendance of 5,628. In the following years the average crowd grew from 7,025 people in 2011\u201312 season to 8,986 people in season 2012\u201313. In season 2013\u201314 there was a decrease to 7,958 people. The fans of M\u00fcnster have rivalries especially with supporters of Arminia Bielefeld and VfL Osnabr\u00fcck. The close proximity between the three cities which are located within a 65-kilometer radius led the press to the name of the Bermuda Triangle of M\u00fcnster, Osnabr\u00fcck and Bielefeld in 3. Liga.http://www.wn.de/Lokalsport/Preussen-Muenster/1807187-Das-Bermudadreieck- in-Liga-drei-Muenster-nervenstark-und-stabil Another minor rival of Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster supporters is Rot Weiss Essen.
