    "text": "Jeffrey Glassberg is an American biologist and author. Following a distinguished academic career he pioneered and patented work in DNA Fingerprinting . Later he founded the North American Butterfly Association (NABA) and is the leading proponent of moving interest in butterflies from hobbyist collecting and nets to butterflying with binoculars and cameras.New York Times Editorial. (July 2, 1995). \"Of Cabbage Whites and Monarchs\" The New York Times. p. 10.George Plimpton. (September 3, 1995). \"Stalking the\u2026 Great Spangled Fritillary?\". The New York Times Magazine. pp. 38-41.Ehrlich, Paul R. (2001). \"Twitching Butterflies\". Science 293 2007-2008. He has written a number of field guides as well as numerous articles. == Life == === Early life === Jeffrey Glassberg was born in Brooklyn, New York, on November 27, 1947, where his family lived until 1952 when they moved to Long Island, New York. His father established his own company making automobile seat covers and his mother worked there as well. Glassberg's early years were devoted to nature; bird-watching, chasing butterflies, and, with his younger brother, to chemistry experimentation. Moving from the buildings of New York City to a place of forests and meadows on Long Island where his parents allowed him to roam stimulated his interest and love of nature which continues. === Family life === Jeffrey Glassberg met his future wife, Jane Scott, in a seminar course on bacteriophage lambda at Rice University. When he moved to Stanford University School of Medicine in 1972, she accompanied him and was a post- doctoral fellow at the University of California, San Francisco. In 1979 they both moved to Rockefeller University, where she worked on virology in the laboratory of Purnell W. Choppin. == Education and academic career == Glassberg graduated from Tufts University School of Engineering with a degree in civil engineering in 1969, but turned to biology after travels to South America with a colleague to study butterflies. He took summer biology courses and taught high school biology on the North Shore of Long Island, before acceptance into the graduate program at Rice University, Houston, Texas, in 1972. Glassberg received his PhD in biology from Rice University in 1977, working on the genetics of bacteriophage SP01 DNA replication in the laboratory of Charlie Stewart.Glassberg, J.; Slomiany, R.A.; Stewart, C.R. (1977). \"Selective screening procedure for the isolation of heat- and cold- sensitive DNA replication-deficient mutants of bacteriophage SP01 and preliminary characterization of the mutants isolated\". Journal of Virology 21 54-60.Glassberg, J.; Franck, M.; Stewart, C.R. (1977). \"Initiation and termination mutants of Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage SP01\". Journal of Virology 21 147-152.Glassberg, J.; Franck, M.; Stewart, C.R. (1977). \"Multiple origins of replication for Basillus subtilis phage SP01\". Virology 78 433-441. He then spent three years in the Biochemistry Department at the Stanford University School of Medicine where he was a post-doctoral fellow in Arthur Kornberg's laboratory doing research on DNA-binding proteins.Meyer, R.R.; Glassberg, J.; Kornberg, A. (1979). \"An Escherichia coli mutant defective in single-strand binding protein is defective in DNA replication\". Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76 1702-1705.Glassberg, J.; Meyer, R.R.; Kornberg, A. (1979). \"Mutant single-strand binding protein of Escherichia coli: genetic and physiological characterization\". J. Bacteriol. 140 14-19.Meyer, R.R.; Glassberg, J.; Scott, J.V.; Kornberg, A. (1980). \"A temperature-sensitive single-strand DNA binding protein from Escherichia coli\". J. Biol. Chem. 255 2897-2901.Meyer, R.R.; Rein, D.C.; Glassberg, J. (1982). \"The product of the lexC gene of Escherichia coli is single-strand DNA-binding protein\". J. Bacteriol. 150 433-435. Glassberg moved to Rockefeller University, New York City in 1979 and worked on creating a genetic system using the eukaryote, Crithidia fasciculata, a trypanosomatid parasite of mosquitos.Glassberg, J.; Miyazaki, L.; Rifkin, M.R. (1985) \"Isolation and partial characterization of mutants of the trypanosomatid Crithidia fasciculata and their use in detecting genetic recombination\". J. Protozool. 32 118-125. == DNA Profiling (DNA Fingerprinting) == Glassberg continued his scientific work as one of the founders of ACTAGEN (an acronym for advanced clinical testing and genetics) in March 1982. This company, renamed as Lifecodes played a major role in the early period of DNA fingerprinting. This included providing the test cases for the first court trials in the United States as well as the first training of F.B.I. personnel in DNA forensics. One of the first F.B.I. scientists trained was Bruce Budowle, a Senior Scientist, who initially headed the F.B.I.\u2019s effort in this area and who later became the Executive Director of the Institute of Applied Genetics at the Univ. of North Texas health Science Center, Ft. Worth, Texas. Glassberg is the inventor on the patent \"Method for forensic analysis\" (US 5593832 A), with a priority date of February 28, 1983. From the abstract: \"This invention relates to a method for identification of samples collected as physical evidence for forensic analysis. The identification is based upon an analysis of DNA length polymorphisms generated by the action of restriction endonucleases.\" Versions of this patent was applied for in a number of countries and in most was granted in 1984. The US patent went through a number of extensions and was finally granted on January 14, 1997. * Belgium as BE899027A1, filing No. 899.027, priority date of February 28, 1983 was granted August 28, 1984. \"Essai Pour la D\u00e9termination \u00e9 La Paternit\u00e9 et Pour L'Etablissement de L'Identite Genetique Individuelle\" .

He is an adjunct faculty member at Rice University in the department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology Graduate Program Faculty . == Conservation with butterflies == In November 1992, Glassberg founded the North American Butterfly Association to engage the public in the support of conservation. As president he has been a driving force behind NABA's growth, including the founding of the National Butterfly Center in southern Texas. == Field guides == He is the author of seven butterfly field guides that use photographs of live butterflies, in addition to initiating and editing a field guide to dragonflies and one to wildflowers. Glassberg was the first to write a butterfly field guide intended for readers to identify butterflies using binoculars. \"His new book, Butterflies Through Binoculars: A Field Guide to Butterflies in the Boston-New York-Washington Region, published this year by Oxford University Press, is the first to focus on netless butterflying.\" \"His own Butterflies through Binoculars, published in 1993, is credited with revolutionizing the pursuit of butterflies with its emphasis on observation in the field\".Nicole Arthur. Washington Post \"Wings of Desire\". The Burlington Free Press. July 6, 2000. p. C1. In 1999, Robert Robbins, then chair of the Department of Entomology at the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s National Museum of Natural History, stated that \"Glassberg\u2019s butterfly guides have provided a new way for amateur naturalists to identify species without collecting them or dissecting them. Previously, he said, butterfly books distinguished between species using technical, almost microscopic details. But in Mr. Glassberg\u2019s years of field observation, Dr. Robbins said, he has found variations in the way butterflies appear that allow species \u2013 or the sex of individuals of a species \u2013 to be distinguished simply by looking. The option of just watching butterflies and understanding what you\u2019re seeing just wasn\u2019t there before\".Revkin, Andrew C. (July 20, 1999). \"Letting Butterflies Flutter Free\". New York Times. The Metro Section. pp. B1, B8 Glassberg's 2001 book, Butterflies Through Binoculars: The West received first place in the nature guidebook category of the 2001 National Outdoor Book Awards.http://www.noba- web.org/books01.htm. p.4. == Books == ____ As sole author: *Butterflies through Binoculars: The Boston-New York-Washington Region.
