    "text": "Frank Neville Hosband Robinson (13 April 1925, West Bromwich, Staffordshire, England \u2013 19 October 1996, Colmar, France) was an English physicist. Neville Robinson was educated at The Leys School in Cambridge, England, and Christ's College, Cambridge, where he read Physics. Robinson initially worked as a civil servant at the Services Electronic Research Laboratory (SERL) in Baldock, Hertfordshire, under the director Robert Sutton. He then moved to the Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford University to undertake a DPhil doctorate degree in low temperature physics, as a Nuffield Research Fellow (1950\u201354). With Jim Daniels and Michael Grace, he produced an example of nuclear orientation for the first time. Then in 1951, in the first nuclear cooling experiment, he produced the lowest temperature ever achieved until then at only ten millionths of a degree Kelvin above absolute zero. Robinson was an English Electric Research Fellow from 1955\u201359. He was a Faculty Fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford from 1958 to 1961, immediately followed by becoming a founding Fellow of St Catherine's College, Oxford where he stayed until his retirement in 1992. He was also a Senior Research Officer at Oxford University during 1959 to 1992, working at the Clarendon Laboratory. During his career, he visited Bell Telephone Laboratories in New Jersey, United States, three times while on sabbatical leave (during 1954\u201355, 1965\u201366, and 1973\u201374). In 1973, Robinson published the book Macroscopic Electromagnetism, a standard text. His paper Microwave shot noise and minimum noise factor was awarded the Clerk Maxwell Prize in 1954 by the British Institution of Radio Engineers. Importantly, he invented the Robinson oscillator in the field of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), which now forms the underlying basis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems used in many hospitals. ==Family== Robinson married Daphne Coulthard in 1952. They had one son, the author Andrew Robinson and two daughters. He died of a heart attack, aged 71, in Colmar, France. ==References== ==External links== * Books by Neville Robinson from Amazon.co.uk Category:1925 births Category:1996 deaths Category:People from West Bromwich Category:People educated at The Leys School Category:Alumni of Christ's College, Cambridge Category:Alumni of Nuffield College, Oxford Category:English civil servants Category:English nuclear physicists Category:Fellows of Nuffield College, Oxford Category:Fellows of St Catherine's College, Oxford Category:Scientists at Bell Labs ",
