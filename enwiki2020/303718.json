    "text": "Carmarthen Town Association Football Club () is a Welsh semi-professional football club based in Carmarthen. The team play their home games at Richmond Park. The club colours, reflected in their crest and kit, are gold and black. Formed in 1950, Carmarthen Town was elected into the Welsh Football League in 1953. Their first league honour came in 1959\u201360, with promotion from Division 2 West to the First Division of the Welsh League. Carmarthen Town's first trophy was the Welsh Football League Cup, which they won in the 1995\u201396 season. Since then the club have gone on to win the Welsh Cup once and the Welsh League Cup twice. They have also qualified for UEFA competitions on four occasions. Carmarthen Town currently play in Cymru Premier and have yet to win a league title, despite being in the top tier of Welsh football since 1996\u201397. The club had their highest finish in 2000\u201301, with third place, which qualified them for European competition for the first time. ==Stadium== Clay Shaw Butler Stand, alt=A grandstand at a sports venue.
