    "text": "General chemical structure of an anilide Anilides (or phenylamides) are a class of chemical compounds which are acyl derivatives of aniline. ==Preparation== Aniline reacts with acyl chlorides or carboxylic anhydrides to give anilides. For example, reaction of aniline with acetyl chloride provides acetanilide (CH3-CO-NH-C6H5). At high temperatures, aniline and carboxylic acids react to give anilides. ==Uses== * Herbicides ==References== ==External links== * ",
