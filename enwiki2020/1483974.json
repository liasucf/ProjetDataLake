He is a longstanding French politician and, from 2014 until 2019, served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for North West France (allied with the Socialist Party and the Party of European Socialists). ==Early life and education== After a degree in Philosophy at Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne University (class of 1980), Peillon became a high school teacher (junior teaching qualification in 1984 and senior teaching qualification in 1986). He remained a teacher until 1992. He worked one year at Henri Emmanuelli staff at the Assembl\u00e9e nationale and resumed his teaching between 1993 and 1997. Peillon completed graduate studies at Pantheon-Sorbonne University, graduating with a PhD in Philosophy in 1992. He was Senior Research Fellow at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique between 2002 and 2004, working on ante- marxist socialism. ==Political career== ===Early career=== * Secretary of the Socialist Party's group of experts (1993\u201394) * Seconded to the First Secretary of the Socialist Party (1995\u201397) * National research secretary of the Socialist Party (1997\u20132000) * Member of the Socialist Party national bureau (since 1994) ===Member of the National Assembly, 1997\u20132002=== Peillon served as a Member of the National Assembly from 1997 until 2002. During his time in office, he was the chairman of the National Assembly's inquiry into money laundering (1999\u20132002). He also served as the Socialist Party's national spokesman (2000\u201302). In a 2000 report co-authored with Arnaud Montebourg, Peillon alleged that Monaco had lax policies with respect to money laundering, including within its famed casino, and that the government of Monaco had been placing political pressure on the judiciary, so that alleged crimes were not properly investigated. In a move to counter efforts by former Socialist Finance Ministers Laurent Fabius and Dominique Strauss-Kahn to recast the Socialist Party as centrist and market-friendly, Peillon joined Montebourg and Julien Dray in 2002 in writing an article for the newspaper Lib\u00e9ration, saying the Socialists faced a \"crisis of confidence\" under its chairman Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. In a clear challenge to the party's free-market wing, the three called on Socialists to \"fight more effectively and resolutely against the ferocity of the new capitalism and the excesses of deregulation.\"Carol Matlack (October 21, 2002), A Party at War with Itself Bloomberg News. In 2007, Peillon joined S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal's campaign team as a spokesperson, alongside Najat Vallaud-Belkacem and Montebourg. ===Minister of Education, 2012\u20132014=== After the election of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Vincent Peillon was appointed Minister of Education on May 16, 2012.
