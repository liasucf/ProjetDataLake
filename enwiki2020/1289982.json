    "text": "The incipit for the Gregorian chant introit from which Laetare Sunday gets its name Rose chasuble (Sunday Gaudete and Laetare), formerly Speyer Cathedral, now Stiftskirche Neustadt / Weinstra\u00dfe Laetare Sunday ( or ) is the fourth Sunday in the season of Lent, in the Western Christian liturgical calendar. Traditionally, this Sunday has been a day of celebration, within the austere period of Lent. This Sunday gets its name from the first few words (incipit) of the traditional Latin entrance (Introit) for the Mass of the day. \"Laetare Jerusalem\" (\"Rejoice, O Jerusalem\") is Latin from Isaiah 66:10. ==History== The term \"Laetare Sunday\" is used by most Roman Catholic and Anglican churches, particularly those with Latin liturgical traditions. The word comes from the Latin laetare, the singular imperative of laetari: \"to rejoice\". The full Introit reads: > Laetare Hierusalem et conventum facite omnes qui diligitis eam; gaudete cum > laetitia, qui in tristitia fuistis, ut exsultetis et satiemini ab uberibus > consolationis vestrae. Psalm: Laetatus sum in his quae dicta sunt mihi: in > domum Domini ibimus. > Rejoice ye with Jerusalem; and be ye glad for her, all ye that delight in > her: exult and sing for joy with her, all ye that in sadness mourn for her; > that ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations. > Psalm: I was glad when they said unto me, We will go into the house of the > Lord. ==Alternative names== This Sunday is currently also known as Mothering Sunday, Refreshment Sunday, mid-Lent Sunday (in French mi-car\u00eame) and Rose Sunday (either because the golden rose (sent by Popes to Catholic sovereigns) used to be blessed at this time, or because the use of rose-colored (rather than violet) vestments was permitted on this day). Historically, the day was also known as \"the Sunday of the Five Loaves,\" from the story of the miracle of the loaves and fishes. Before the adoption of the modern \"common lectionaries\", this narrative was the traditional Gospel reading for this Sunday in Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, and Old Catholic churches. The station church at Rome for this day was Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, one of the seven chief basilicas; the Golden Rose, sent by Popes to Catholic sovereigns, used to be blessed at this time and for this reason the day was sometimes called Dominica de Rosa. ==Customs== Anglican Bishop of Willesden (London), wearing rose-pink vestments on Laetare Sunday, accompanied by three of his priests, also in rose-pink stoles, at North Acton parish church In Roman Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran and Old Catholic churches flowers may appear on the high altar and the organ may be played as a solo instrument. Priests are given the option to wear rose-colored vestments at Mass held on this day in place of the violet vestments normally worn during Lent.The traditional use of rose-pink vestments on this day by Anglican clergy is suggested in the liturgical colour sequence notes of Common Worship of which an on-line version may be found here (see near bottom of page). The term \"rose\" is used to describe this lighter shade of the color violet in the Roman Rite. The Sunday is considered a day of relaxation from normal Lenten rigours; a day of hope with Easter at last within sight. Traditionally, weddings (otherwise banned during Lent) could be performed on this day,See for example, Laetare Sunday extract and servants were released from service for the day to visit their mothers (hence 'Mothering Sunday'). ==Date== Laetare Sunday is exactly 21 days before Easter Sunday, a moveable feast based on the cycles of the moon.
