Despite the festival's name it was not solely a rock festival but presented music from all genres, especially mainstream and electronic music. The festival was last held in 2013, being cancelled permanently after that. == Beginnings == A View of the main stage at the 2006 event Fatboy Slim took his 'Brighton Beach Party' to the shores of Loch Ness to create the first festival which was held on Saturday 24 June 2006.
