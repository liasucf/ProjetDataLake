    "text": "Giosue Giuppone on a Peugeot Motorcycle Giosu\u00e8 Giuppone (Calco, 29 September 1878 \u2013 Wirwignes, 16 September 1910) was an Italian track cyclist, motorcycle racer and race car driver in the early 1900s. He was racing Peugeot motorcycle and automobiles until his death in 1910.Auto Racing Comes of Age, 2013. Robert Dick, McFarland, ==Biography== Giuppone's sporting career began in bicycling, and he won two Italian national championships in middle-distance racing. He moved to motorcycle racing in the early 1900s, most notably for the Peugeot racing team. He was the second Italian rider to compete in the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy. His races for Peugeot included extensive track racing on the large-capacity, ultra-lightweight racers of the early 1900s, which typically weighed a maximum of 110lbs, but had unlimited engine capacity, as much as 2liters at times. He also raced Peugeot automobiles as part of the factory team, winning the Coupe des Voiturettes in 1909, the Torino Cup and the Circuito delle Madonie in 1908.Motos Peugeot; 1898-1998 100 Ans D'histoire. 1998, Bernard Salvat, Didier Ganneau. Editions EBS, France. The accident that cost him his life occurred during testing of the Coupe des Voiturettes, 1910: a cyclist crossed the street while Giuppone's car was racing at high speed. In an effort to avoid the cyclist, Giuppone made a sharp turn, which caused a spin and the rollover of his Peugeot. Left crushed by his car, Giuppone died instantly, while his mechanic (Paul P\u00e9an) was slightly wounded. A monument to Guippone was built at the site of the accident. Giosu\u00e8 Giuppone was a cousin of cyclists Stefano and Serafino Giuppone. ==References== Category:1878 births Category:1910 deaths Category:Italian male cyclists Category:Italian motorcycle racers ",
