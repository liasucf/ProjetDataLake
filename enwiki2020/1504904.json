    "text": "Crookston (, ) is a residential suburb on the southwestern edge of the city of Glasgow, Scotland. Two distinct and geographically separate neighbourhoods about apart on opposite sides of the White Cart Water are known by the Crookston name, owing to factors in their development. Both areas share the same main road (A736 Crookston Road) and fall within the same U.K. and Scottish Parliamentary constituencies (as of 2019 boundaries), but the northern area falls under the Cardonald ward for Glasgow City Council and is within the G52 postcode zone, while the southern area is in the Greater Pollok ward and the G53 postcode zone. ==History== ===Crookston Estate=== The lands of Crookston were named after the feudal Anglo-Norman lord, Robert Croc who was granted the deeds by David I of Scotland, via Walter fitz Alan,Crookston Heritage Trail, Glasgow City Council in 1170 and soon built Crookston Castle ( in Scottish Gaelic) on a small knoll. In addition to the first wooden version of the castle \u2013 John Stewart of Darnley had the surviving stone version built in around 1400 \u2013 Robert Croc had a chapel constructed as well as a hospital,The Topographical, Statistical, and Historical Gazetteer of Scotland, Volume 1 (page 270), A.

View from Crookston Castle towards west Pollok, Leverndale and Crookston Road (2005) The area north of the castle, between the Levern Water and the White Cart Water, was forested and known as Crookston Wood (Iron Age remains were found there during a 1959 archaeological excavation),Glasgow, Pollok | Earthwork (Period Unassigned), Fort (Iron Age), Canmore while several farms surrounding the castle also shared the name: Crookston House and Farm to its west, Nether Crookston just to its south, Old Crookston further south and Mains of Crookston to its east.The Mains of Cruickston (Pollok House, 1830), The Glasgow Story The castle was captured in the mid-1500sCruckston Castle (Pollok House, 1830), The Glasgow Story and its importance diminished, although it was restored in the mid-19th century by the Maxwells of PollokCrookston Castle, The Castles of ScotlandBattle begins to reclaim castle for local community, Evening Times, 31 July 2013 and was donated by the family to the National Trust for Scotland in 1931, being the first property the organisation managed. ===Crookston Station area=== Motor trading business on Paisley Road West, just within Glasgow at its boundary with Ralston, Renfrewshire Abandoned buildings (now converted to houses) and tracks at Crookston railway station (1986) View of the White Cart Water at Howford Bridge from NCR 7 which runs beneath it Although other names such as Cardonald, Hillington, Ingleston, Ralston and Rosshill were associated with the territory north of the White Cart river, in 1885 the Crookston name was still sufficiently prominent locally for it to be chosen as the name of a station on the Glasgow and South Western Railway's new route between Glasgow and Paisley \u2013 sited between the White Cart and the main road between the towns (A761 Paisley Road West), the tracks followed the trajectory of the abandoned Glasgow, Paisley and Johnstone Canal and was thus titled the Paisley Canal line). Over the next few decades, a small commuter suburb consisting mostly of large villas, was constructed around the station, and inevitably this community became known as Crookston.
