    "text": "Julian Wylie (1 August 1878 \u2013 6 December 1934), originally Julian Ulrich Samuelson Metzenberg, was a British theatrical agent and producer. He began as an accountant and took an interest in entertainment through his brothers, Lauri Wylie and G. B. Samuelson. About 1910, he became the business manager and agent of David Devant, an illusionist, then took on other clients, and formed a partnership with James W. Tate. By the end of his life he was known as the 'King of Pantomime'. ==Early life and background== Born in Southport, Lancashire, Wylie was the son of Henschel and Bertha Samuelson, tobacconists originally from Prussia.1881 United Kingdom census, 41, Nevill Street, Southport, at ancestry.co.uk, accessed 5 May 2020 Although Wylie's parents used the name Samuelson, between 1876 and 1889 the births of their five children were registered under the name Metzenberg, with Samuelson as a middle name.\"Metzenberg, Sydney Samuelson / Ormskirk 8b 744a\" (1876); \"METZENBERG Julian Ulric S / Ormskirk 8b 788\" (1878); \"METZENBERG Maurice Laurence S / Ormskirk 8b 785\" (1880); \"METZENBERG Rahleen May S / Ormskirk 8b 782 (1887); \"Metzenberg George Berthold S / Ormskirk 8b 787\" (1889); in General Index to Births in England and Wales In fact, the name of Samuelson was a patronymic drawn from Henschel's father, Samuel Metzenberg, of Lissa in the Prussian Grand Duchy of Posen. Henschel, born in 1829, left home in 1841 and lived with an uncle in Dublin before settling in Southport in about 1873. The surname of Wylie, later adopted by some of his children, was an anglicisation of Mrs Samuelson's name before her marriage.Gabriel A. Sivan, \"George Berthold Samuelson (1889\u20131947): Britain's Jewish film pioneer\" in Jewish Historical Studies, vol. 44 (2012) p. 204 A daughter of Solomon Weile, she was Bertha Weile when marrying Henschel Metzenberg in Kensington in 1875.\"METZENBERG Henschel & WEILE Bertha/ Kensington 1a 335\" in General Index to Marriages in England and Wales, 1875 The Samuelsons are believed to have been the first Jews in Southport.\"Jewish Southport\" at southportsynagogue.co.uk, accessed 6 May 2020 Wylie's father died in 1889, and his death was recorded in the name of Henschel Samuelson Metzenberg.\"Metgenberg [sic] Henschel S, 60 / Ormskirk 8b 539\" in General Index to Deaths in England and Wales, 1889 In the 1891 and 1901 censuses, his widow Bertha Samuelson was still carrying on the tobacconist business in Southport.1891 United Kingdom census, 41, Nevill Street, Southport; 1901 United Kingdom census, 41, Nevill Street, Southport; at ancestry.co.uk, accessed 5 May 2020 ==Career== David Devant, Wylie's first artiste Julian Wylie began his career as an accountant. His earliest contacts with the world of entertainment came through his younger brothers, Lauri Wylie, who was first active as an actor in the late 1890s, and G. B. Samuelson, who operated cinemas. About 1910, Julian Wylie became the business manager and agent of David Devant, a leading illusionist.Albert Edward Wilson, Pantomime pageant: a procession of harlequins, clowns, comedians (1946) p. 126: \"Wylie was a Lancashire man and began as an accountant. His first association with the entertainment industry was when he became business manager to David Devant, the illusionist. After that he joined forces with James W. Tate...\" Another story is that Wylie married a much older woman with a small son, she lent him one pound, and he established himself in London as an agent. In any event, soon after his connection with Devant he was acting as agent for other variety artistes.\"THE IMPRESARIOS WYLIE\u2013TATE\" at its-behind- you.com, accessed 5 May 2020 In December 1911, from an office at 50 Langham Street, Wylie advertised his services in The Sporting Life as \"An Ideas Agent\".\"AN IDEAS AGENT.

Tate, with offices at 125 Shaftesbury Avenue and later in Oxford Street. The two men were quite different, Tate mild and genial, getting on easily with everyone, Wylie suspicious and aggressive, with a deep sense of inferiority. A nervous personality, Wylie suffered from mood swings, from rage to cheerful optimism. He has been called \"a large and enthusiastic north countryman\", and his favourite words of approval were \"Tremenjus! Tremenjus!\" Writing on Wylie, James Harding notes that \"He never took to drink \u2013 he took to Ice-Cream. Buckets of it...\"James Harding, in George Robey & the Music Hall, quoted in \"THE IMPRESARIOS WYLIE\u2013TATE\" at its- behind-you.com, accessed 7 May 2020 The first Wylie and Tate co-production was a revue called I Should Worry, at the Palace Theatre in August 1913. By 1915 Wylie was producing plays written by his younger brother Lauri Wylie, who had developed into a writer.The Stage Year Book, 1915 Wylie was an enthusiast for lighting and always planned it carefully himself.

Name Julian Ulric Samuelson, Birth abt 1878, 7 September 1920 After the First World War, Wylie and Tate concentrated more on pantomime, and the business flourished through the Roaring Twenties, despite the sudden death of Tate in February 1922, and on into the 1930s. Through the skill of Wylie, the Drury Lane pantomime was briefly brought back to Drury Lane in 1929. By the end of his life he had produced over a hundred pantomimes and was known as \"the King of pantomime\", a title also given to others later. ==Death== Willesden Jewish Cemetery Wylie died suddenly on 6 December 1934 at 3:15 in the morning, aged 56.
