    "text": "The House of Ch\u00e2teaudun is a medieval lineage that once possessed the Viscounty of Ch\u00e2teaudun, the County of Perche, and the County of Anjou. == Origin of the House of Ch\u00e2teaudun == The House of Ch\u00e2teaudun descended from Gauzfred I (or Geoffrey I) whom Count Theobald I of Blois made Viscount of Ch\u00e2teaudun in 956. Recent research makes him a direct-line agnatic descendant of the Frankish family Rorgonides. For a list of the Counts and Viscounts of Ch\u00e2teaudun, see the article Counts of Ch\u00e2teaudun. == Branches of the House of Ch\u00e2teaudun == The House of Ch\u00e2teaudun split in two distinct branches. Descended from Fulcois du Perche, probably the second son of Gauzfred I, were: * The lineage of the Counts of Perche, extinct by 1217, with Thomas du Perche;extinction delayed until 1226 with death of Thomas's uncle William. * The line of viscounts of Ch\u00e2teaudun, extinct by 1249, with Geoffrey VI of Ch\u00e2teaudun; * The lineage of the counts of Anjou, who acquired the land by the marriage of a grandson of Fulcois, Geoffrey II, Count of G\u00e2tinais with Ermengarde of Anjou, heiress of the House of Ingelger. Their great-grandson in direct agnatic line will be Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou. The Plantagenets are descended from this line. == Genealogy == Note: The dotted lines represent hypothetical relationships. It is not clear whether Hugh, Archbishop of Tours, and Adalaud of Ch\u00e2teau- Chinon are sons or grandsons of Geoffrey I of Ch\u00e2teaudun. Some sources say that Geoffrey had a son called Hugh, who was himself viscount of Ch\u00e2teaudun, and both the Archbishop of Tours and the Lord of Ch\u00e2teau-Chinon would in turn be his sons. The number of people called \"Hugh\" who were viscounts of Ch\u00e2teaudun is thus unclear, and the numbering of each viscount with this name could be wrong by 1. The parentage of Fulcois is also disputed. Some sources put him as the son of Geoffrey I of Ch\u00e2teaudun. Others claim he was his grandson-in-law through marriage to a granddaughter of Geoffrey called Melisende. == Sources == * France Balade : ** les vicomtes de Ch\u00e2teaudun ** les comtes du Perche * Foundation for Medieval Genealogy : ** Vicomtes de Ch\u00e2teaudun ** Comtes du Perche, comtes de Mortagne ==References== Category:Counts of Ch\u00e2teaudun Category:French noble families ",
