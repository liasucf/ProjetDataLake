    "text": "{| |} MS Regina Baltica is a cruiseferry owned by the Estonian shipping company Tallink. She was built in 1980 as Viking Song by W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Perno shipyard, Finland for Rederi Ab Sally, one of the owners of the Viking Line consortium. She has also sailed under the names Braemar (for Fred Olsen Lines) and Anna Karenina (for Baltic Shipping Co.). ==History== Viking Song in Stockholm, 1984. ===Viking Line and Fred. Olsen service=== Braemar in 1986. Delivered in August 1980, Viking Song was the last newbuilding delivered to Rederi Ab Sally for use on Viking Line's routes. She served alongside her sister Viking Saga on the route connecting Helsinki, Finland to Stockholm. Although she was the newer of the two ships, when SF Line brought their new Mariella to Helsinki\u2013Stockholm service in 1985, the Viking Song was withdrawn from service and sold to Norwegian Fred. Olsen Lines. After rebuilding at Blohm + Voss, Hamburg where a second storey was added to her nightclub, Viking Song emerged as Fred. Olsen's new MS Braemar. She was initially set on a route connecting Oslo, Norway with Harwich, UK, although her route varied a lot during the next five years, with Hirtshals, Denmark replacing or appearing alongside Harwich as the main destination. In December 1990 Fred. Olsen sold their ferry operations to the new Color Line, however Braemar was not included in the sale and she was laid up. ===Russian Army and Baltic Line=== In January 1991 Braemar was chartered to Baltic Shipping Company and renamed Baltica for planned service between St. Petersburg, Russia and Stockholm. This service was never realised however, and for the time being the only change was moving the ship to Hamburg where she was again laid up. Later in the same month the ship was sub-chartered to the Russian army for transporting troops out of former East Germany. The ship, renamed Anna Karenina, was badly vandalised by the troops transported on board, and had to be docked in Hamburg afterwards for repairs. March 1991 finally saw the beginning of a service out of St. Petersburg, when Anna Karenina started traffic on the St. Petersburg\u2013Nyn\u00e4shamn\u2013Kiel route for Baltic Line. In 1995 St. Petersburg was dropped from the itinerary. In January 1996 Baltic Line was declared bankrupt and Anna Karenina (soon renamed Anna K.) returned to Fred. Olsen for laying up in Germany. ===EstLine and Tallink=== Anna K. was sold to EstLine (a daughter company of Nordstr\u00f6m & Thulin, Sweden and ESCO, Estonia) in 1996 for service between Tallinn, Estonia and Stockholm, Sweden. She was renamed Regina Baltica. In 1997 Nordstr\u00f6m & Thulin withdrew from Estline leaving ESCO as the sole owner of the company. ESCO later changed its name to Hansatee Shipping. At the end of 2000 the name Estline was abandoned and the Tallinn\u2013Stockholm service became a part of Tallink. In May 2004 a call at Mariehamn was added to maintain tax-free sales on board. In spring 2005 the ship was temporarily chartered to NATO for training exercises in Norway. On 28 September 2005 the ship ran aground in Swedish waters near Kapellsk\u00e4r. There were no victims in the accident, which happened on the day of the 11th anniversary of the sinking of the Estonia. In April 2006 Regina Baltica made three trips between Tallinn and Helsinki, due to the ice situation being so bad that all of Tallink's normal ships on the route could not traffic. On May of the same year MS Romantika replaced her on the Tallinn\u2013Mariehamn\u2013Stockholm route, and Regina Baltica was moved to Stockholm\u2013Riga route, where she replaced Fantaasia. In August of the same year the Regina Balticas homeport was changed from Tallinn to Riga. ===Acciona Trasmediterr\u00e1nea=== The Regina Baltica was withdrawn from service with Tallink in April 2009, when she was replaced by Romantika in the Stockholm\u2013Riga service. Subsequently she was chartered to the Spain-based Acciona Trasmediterr\u00e1nea and entered service their Almer\u00eda\u2013Nador route on 25 June 2009. On 20 September 2009 she was returned to Tallink and laid up in Riga. In the end of May 2010 Regina Baltica was again chartered to Acciona Trasmediterr\u00e1nea, serving first on their Algeciras\u2013Tangier route and from June on the Almeria\u2014Nador route. This charter will last until 3 September 2010. ===Strandfaraskip Landsins=== Regina Baltica en route from V\u00e1gur, Su\u00f0uroy to T\u00f3rshavn in the Faroe Islands on 17 September 2010. On 11 September 2010 Regina Baltica arrived in V\u00e1gur, Faroe Islands. She was chartered to Strandfaraskip Landsins for four weeks from 17 September onwards for use on the service linking T\u00f3rshavn to Tv\u00f8royri in Su\u00f0uroy while the regular ferry on the route \u2013 the \u2013 undergoes a docking in Denmark.SSL.fo , (in Faroese) The first journey was from V\u00e1gur in Su\u00f0uroy, but the rest of the time Regina Baltica was embarking and disembarking from Krambatangi ferry port near Tv\u00f8royri. The schedule had to be changed, because it takes longer time to embark with Regina Baltica, therefore the ferry can't sail 3 times daily from T\u00f3rshavn three times weekly like Smyril did, but two times daily every day.SSL.fo , Fer\u00f0\u00e6tlan hj\u00e1 M/F Regina Baltica (Time Schedule of M/F Regina Baltica).
