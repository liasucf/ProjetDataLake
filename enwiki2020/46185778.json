Saints of Irish origin who were particularly revered included various figures called St Faelan and St. Colman, and saints Findbar and Finan.G. W. S. Barrow, Kingship and Unity: Scotland 1000\u20131306 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , p. 64. Columba remained a major figure into the fourteenth century and a new foundation at the cite of his bones was endowed by William I (r. 1165\u20131214) at Arbroath Abbey.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (Random House, 2011), , p. 76.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (New York City, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 52\u20133. In Strathclyde the most important saint was St Kentigern, whose cult (under the pet name St. Mungo) became focused in Glasgow.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , p. 46. In Lothian it was St Cuthbert, whose relics were carried across Northumbria after Lindisfarne was sacked by the Vikings before being installed in Durham Cathedral.A. Lawrence-Mathers, Manuscripts in Northumbria in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2003), , p. 137. After his martyrdom around 1115, a cult emerged in Orkney, Shetland and northern Scotland around Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney.H. Antonsson, St. Magn\u00fas of Orkney: A Scandinavian Martyr-Cult in Context (Leiden: Brill, 2007), . ===Veneration of Saint Andrew=== St Andrew is the patron saint of Scotland and has a long history of veneration there.St Andrew, Patron Saint of Scotland The cult of St Andrew was established on the east coast at Kilrymont by the Pictish kings as early as the eighth century.G. W. S. Barrow, Robert Bruce and the Community of the Realm of Scotland (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 4th edn., 2005), , p. 11. The shrine, which from the twelfth century was said to have contained the relics of the saint brought to Scotland by Saint Regulus.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (New York City, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), , p. 55. ===Developments in the Late Middle Ages=== By the twelfth century it had become known simply as St. Andrews and it became increasingly associated with Scottish national identity and the royal family. Queen Margaret was canonised in 1250 and after the ceremonial transfer of her remains to Dunfermline Abbey emerged as one of the most revered national saints. In the late medieval period, as the doctrine of Purgatory gained in importance in the period, the number of chapelries, priests and masses for the dead within them grew rapidly,Andrew D. M. Barrell, Medieval Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , p. 254. along with the number of altars to saints, with St. Mary's in Dundee having perhaps 48 and St Giles' in Edinburgh over 50,P.

Williams, A Companion to Medieval Scottish Poetry (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2006), , pp. 26\u20139. as did the number of saints celebrated in Scotland, with about 90 being added to the missal used in St Nicholas church in Aberdeen.C. Peters, Women in Early Modern Britain, 1450\u20131640 (Palgrave Macmillan, 2004), , p. 147. ===Impact of the Reformation=== The Reformation made the veneration of saints illegal and removed almost all evidence of saints and shrines from churches,J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 1991), , p. 153. although Catholicism continued as a minority religion. The period created only one Catholic saint, the convert and martyr John Ogilvie (1569\u20131615).J. Buckley, F. C. Bauerschmidt, T. Pomplun, eds, The Blackwell Companion to Catholicism (London: John Wiley & Sons, 2010), , p. 164. ==List of saints== A * Adomn\u00e1n * Adrian of May * Almus * Andrew the Apostle B * Barvitus * Blane C * Cainnech of Aghaboe * Cathan * Cathr\u00f3e of Metz * Colman * Columba * Constantine of Strathclyde * Conval * Curet\u00e1n * Cuthbert D * David I of Scotland * Donald of Ogilvy * Donn\u00e1n of Eigg * Drostan * Duthac E * Magnus * Ernan F * Fergus * Finan * Fillan of Pittenweem * Fillan * Finbarr of Cork G * Gervadius * Gilbert de Moravia H * Himelin I * Inan K * Kessog * Ronald of Orkney L * Ludan M * Machan * Machar * Margaret of Scotland * Marnock * Medan * Mirin * Modan * Molaise of Leighlin * Moluag * Monan * Mungo * Munn N * Nathalan * Ninian O * Oda * Odran of Iona * John Ogilvie P * Psalmodius R * Regulus * Rufus S * Serf T * Teneu * Ternan * Triduana W * Wendelin of Trier * William of Perth ==References== ",
