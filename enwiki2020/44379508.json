Chief superintendent Jim Leslie said: Generally the behavior of fans this year has been excellent. Praise must go to them for playing their part in keeping crime figures down; for the majority, people were in tremendous spirits and focused on being here for the right reasons, to enjoy music and have a great time with friends. The number of visits to the medical tent also dramatically dropped in 2014, with the medical team reporting 980 visits to the hospital tent. This is a sharp decrease when compared with the 1160 visits in 2013. The visits to the medical tent were all minor, such as: weather related ailments and sprains and strains. ==Reception== Most festival-goers were happy with conditions at the festival, and remarked positively on the strength and variety of the headliners. ==New location== Strathallan Castle In 2015, the festival was relocated to Strathallan Castle. This was due to a section of the festival grounds being situated over the Fortes Pipeline, causing the Health and Safety Executive(HSE) to request for the festival to be relocated away from its current site at Balado. According to HSE, an accident could result in a large number of casualties and people receiving a dangerous dose of thermal radiation. ==See also== *List of music festivals in the United Kingdom ==References== Category:2014 in Scotland Category:2014 in British music Category:T in the Park Category:July 2014 events in the United Kingdom Category:2014 music festivals ",
