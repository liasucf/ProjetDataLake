    "text": "100cc is an compilation album by the English rock band 10cc. It was released in 1975 by UK Records, the band's original label, to capitalize on the then 10cc's recent departure to Mercury Records and band's success in the immediate aftermath of the release of their third album, The Original Soundtrack, and the \"I'm Not in Love\" single. The UK edition of the compilation contains a selection of singles on the first side, while the second side contains all of the non-album b-sides from the first two albums' singles. Around the same time \"Waterfall\" b/w \"4% of Something\" was released as a single by UK Records. ==Track listing== ===U.K. edition=== ;Side one # \"Rubber Bullets\" (Kevin Godley, Lol Creme, Graham Gouldman) \u2013 5:18 # \"Donna\" (Godley, Creme) \u2013 2:54 # \"The Dean and I\" (Godley, Creme) \u2013 3:03 # \"The Wall Street Shuffle\" (Eric Stewart, Gouldman) \u2013 4:02 # \"Silly Love\" (Creme, Stewart) \u2013 3:56 ;Side two # \"Waterfall\" (Stewart, Gouldman) \u2013 3:41 # \"4% of Something\" (Stewart, Creme) \u2013 4:01 # \"Gismo My Way\" (Stewart, Gouldman, Godley, Creme) \u2013 3:44 # \"Hot Sun Rock\" (Stewart, Gouldman) \u2013 3:01 # \"Bee in My Bonnet\" (Stewart, Gouldman) \u2013 2:02 # \"18 Carat Man of Means\" (Gouldman, Stewart, Godley, Creme) \u2013 3:27 ===U.S. edition=== ;Side one # \"Old Wild Men\" (Godley, Creme) \u2013 3:18 # \"The Wall Street Shuffle\" (Stewart, Gouldman) \u2013 3:30 # \"Somewhere in Hollywood\" (Godley, Creme) \u2013 5:28 # \"Rubber Bullets\" (Godley, Creme, Gouldman) \u2013 4:41 # \"Waterfall\" (Stewart, Gouldman) \u2013 3:41 ;Side two # \"The Worst Band in the World\" (Creme, Gouldman) \u2013 2:45 # \"Donna\" (Godley, Creme) \u2013 2:54 # \"The Dean and I\" (Godley, Creme) \u2013 3:03 # \"Fresh Air for My Momma\" (Godley, Creme, Stewart) \u2013 3:02 # \"Silly Love\" (Creme, Stewart)\u2013 3:56 ==Personnel== * Eric Stewart \u2013 guitar, keyboards, vocals * Graham Gouldman \u2013 bass, guitar, percussion, vocals * Lol Creme \u2013 guitar, keyboards, percussion, vocals * Kevin Godley \u2013 drums, percussion, vocals ==References== Category:10cc albums Category:1975 compilation albums ",
