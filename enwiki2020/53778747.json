The palace was property of the Radziwi\u0142\u0142 family until the first half of the nineteenth-century. In 1823 the building was sold to Ludwik Micha\u0142 Pac who, following architect Enrico Marconi's designs, carried out a reconstruction of the palace into the Classisist architectural style. The palace was partially destroyed during World War II, with reconstruction works carried out between 1948 and 1951. Presently, the palace houses the headquarters of the Ministry of Health.
