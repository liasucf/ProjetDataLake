Made by a graduate of the first generation of students from the film school at San Antonio de los Ba\u00f1os, Cuba, this black and white parody of bureaucracy in Cuba features a cleaning woman who discovers that her boss is making obscene phone calls. The film was directed by Juan Carlos Cremata, then a Cuban student at the EICTV (International Film School of San Antonio de los Ba\u00f1os). The short made the festival rounds winning several awards and is now considered a Latinamerican Classic. ==Awards== * Gran Premio \"El Chicuelo\".
