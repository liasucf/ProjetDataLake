It was withdrawn after three years. The company then launched an off-peak service between Leek and Buxton which was also later withdrawn. In 1998 Bakers' were awarded Cheshire County Council contracted route 27 between Macclesfield and Knutsford. The route was initially operated every two hours with one bus, but was doubled in frequency in 1999. The contract was lost in 2008. Contracted journeys on route 99 (Biddulph - Congleton) were also taken over in 1998. The company joined Julian Peddle's newly formed Status Group in 1999, and the trading name BakerBus was adopted for local services. The company left Status Group in 2002. In 2001, two new routes were started, both to the AstraZeneca factory near Alderley Edge. Both were withdrawn in 2007 as passenger numbers had fallen and AstraZeneca withdrew funding. However the company's route 99 was made fully commercial in 2006 and extended to operate to Macclesfield and continued to serve the AstraZeneca site at nearby Hurdsfield.Interim Review of the Bus Services Working Group In September 2004, First Potteries had its operator licence cut, and abandoned several routes with BakerBus taking over three routes in the Newcastle-under-Lyme area, losing one after three years but retaining the other two routes, 33 and 33A Newcastle-under-Lyme - Westlands on a long-term basis. They were registered commercially, and eventually taken over by D&G; Bus. It also gained route 77 between Hanley and Congleton, which it also registered commercially. This too, is now operated by D&G; Bus. In February 2005 a new limited stop route, X1, was launched between Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent railway station and Stafford. It was funded by Staffordshire University, whose campus it served. Once the university closed the Beaconsfield campus, the service was withdrawn. From 2006, route X1 covered for the suspended train service between Stafford and Stone, Barlaston and Wedgwood, with funding from Central Trains; Stone had its services restored in 2008, but the others were still served only by the bus. At the same time the X1 service ceased to operate into Stafford Town Centre, and now terminated at the Staffordshire University campus at Beaconside.
