Unlike other multiplexes, the regional ITV broadcaster has control over which services are to be broadcast on their allotted amount of the capacity, leading to small regional differences across the country. ==See also== *List of digital terrestrial television channels (UK) Category:ITV (TV network) Category:Channel 4 ",
