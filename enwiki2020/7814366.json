Savinian should not be confused with another early French martyr, Sabinian of Troyes. Gregory of Tours does not mention them,Catholic Encyclopedia: Sens nor does the Hieronymian Martyrology, which was revised before 600 at Auxerre or Autun. One source states that \"it is considered likely that Sabinian and Potentian were bishops of Sens, with Potentian succeeding Sabinian.\"Sts.
