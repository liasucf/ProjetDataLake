    "text": "The California Capitol Christmas Tree (known as the California Capitol Holiday Tree between 1999 and 2003) is an annually erected decorated tree outside the California State Capitol in Sacramento, California, United States. Initiated in 1950, the tree has been a tradition ever since and is decorated during the second week of December each year. In December 1999, during his first Christmas season in office, Governor Gray Davis changed the name of the tree to the California Capitol Holiday Tree, a spokesperson describing this as a name that \"more accurately symbolizes the diversity of what the holidays are in California\". After the 2003 California recall, Gray Davis was replaced with Arnold Schwarzenegger, who changed the name back from the Christmas of 2004. A similar occurrence took place with the Capitol Christmas Tree in Washington, DC, which took on the \"holiday\" generic name from 1999-2005\\. ==References== Category:Individual Christmas trees Category:Individual trees in California Category:Culture of Sacramento, California Category:Christmas in the United States Category:Tourist attractions in Sacramento, California Category:Recurring events established in 1950 Category:1950 establishments in California ",
