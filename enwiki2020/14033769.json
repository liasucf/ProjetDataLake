He is primarily known for his abstract paintings that have been widely exhibited in the United States and in Europe since the 1960s. His work is associated with Minimal Art, Post-minimalism, and Lyrical Abstraction. Young has participated in more than a hundred group exhibitions and he has had more than forty solo exhibitions in important contemporary art galleries throughout his career. He currently lives in Bisbee, Arizona.Ben la Rocco, TRACKS: Peter Young: An Unlikely Artist ==Career== He began his career as an abstract painter in New York City during the mid-1960s. During the 1960s and 1970s his paintings were included in two annual exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and group exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Leo Castelli Gallery among several other important venues. In April 1971 his work was discussed at length and appeared on the cover in ArtForum magazine, written by art historian and professor of modern art at Oberlin College, Ellen H. Johnson. During the summer and early fall of 2007 Young had a major retrospective exhibition of his paintings from the period from 1963 through 1977 at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Queens and at the Mitchell Algus Gallery in Chelsea in New York City.NY Times review, accessed, November 2, 2007 ==Awards== * 1968 : National Endowment for the Arts Grant. * 1969 : Theodoran Award, Solomon R.
