In 1819, Samuel Brooks, son of one of the founders, opened a branch of the bank in Manchester. In the 1820s, a second generation Cunliffe opened a London house, at 29 Lombard Street. In 1844, the Manchester bank was listed in an Act of Parliament as one of ten provincial banks working under an arrangement with the Bank of England. The London house merged with Alexanders, a discount house, in 1864, but a new London house, Brooks and Co., was opened at 81 Lombard Street by the sole partner in the Blackburn bank.
