The following year, under the influence of a disappointment in love, he left teaching and took orders. He was noted for his preaching talents. At the French Revolution, he broke his vows and turned to theater. Around 1797, he was in charge of French literature at the French Prytan\u00e9e, former Louis-le- Grand college. He remained professor of rhetoric at the Imperial High School at the time of the reorganization of the University. He was then called to the Latin poetry chair at the Sorbonne. In 1805, he gave his poem in six songs Achille \u00e0 Scyros, his best known work. Imitated from the Achilleid by Statius, it is a book written with care, which includes interesting and ingenious features descriptions, even if the whole lacks of movement and relieves some boredom. In theater, Luce Lancival won his greatest success shortly before his death, with his tragedy Hector, shown in 1809 at the Com\u00e9die fran\u00e7aise. On a topic drawn from the Iliad, the play caused a sensation with a character judged by the very contemporary faithful to the spirit of ancient Greece. Napoleon rewarded the author by giving him a pension of 6,000 French francs. His love of life, pushed to debauchery, was famous in his time. He was to lose a leg in an accident and used a wooden substitute. Despite this weakness and failing health, he committed himself with great dedication to the teaching of literature and was an outstanding educator. Stendhal wrote \"Luce Lancival had a wooden leg and kindness\".Memoirs of an Egotist, chap.IXHis early death was caused by syphilis.
