    "text": "New Alcatraz (named Boa on VHS and DVD), is a 2002 American direct-to-video science fiction action horror film. It was directed by Phillip Roth and starred Dean Cain. In the middle of Antarctica, a high maximum-security prison called New Alcatraz has recently become operational. When a mining crew inside the prison accidentally drills into a strange rock formation, a giant, prehistoric boa constrictor is unleashed upon the prison and goes on a killing rampage. It is up to the prison staff, inmates, two paleontologists, and a group of soldiers to hunt down and eliminate the beast. ==Plot== In New Alcatraz, the world's most secure prison located in Antarctica, a drilling operation inadvertently releases a giant boa constrictor from a large, hollow rock that had been preserving it in suspended animation. The snake chews a hole through the ice, enabling it to escape into the prison. The hole is discovered by workers and a guard is placed on it until the engineers can assess the hole and block it up. In the meantime, the snake attacks and kills the guard, along with the engineers before moving further into the prison. The prison sends out a distress call which is received by the United States military. They hire paleontologist Robert Trenton and his wife Jessica to assist a military team in the search to destroy the snake. When they arrive at the prison, they discover a group of survivors, led be head of security Quinn and prison warden Fred Riley. The security and military personnel split up and set out to find and kill the snake whilst Robert, Jessica and Fred watch on in the control room. One by one, the snake kills the personnel. Robert and Jessica join in the hunt. After a skirmish with the snake, a gas pipe ruptures and explodes, killing the remaining security and military members. Robert and Jessica survive and flee from the snake, but Jessica is seemingly killed. Robert returns to the security room and convinces Fred to release the prisoners to help in their escape. Fred releases the prisoners, and the group devises a plan to escape. During the escape, one of the prisoners, Kelly Mitich, attempts to save himself, only to be killed by the snake and accidentally causing another gas explosion, killing Fred. Meanwhile, the other group led by Russian prisoner Yuri Breshcov finds Jessica alive, and they take her in. The snake then kills two of the prisoners, but Yuri and Jessica escape to the surface. Meanwhile, Robert and prisoner Patricia O'Boyle attempt to escape, although the snake kills Patricia while Robert escapes to the surface. Robert, Jessica, and Yuri attempt to escape on the military plane, although the snake sneaks onboard and kills one of the pilots. In the ensuing battle, the snake is ejected from the plane, but Yuri is dragged out with it, and the two fall to their deaths. Robert and Jessica, bewildered but alive, fly to safety. ==Cast== *Dean Cain as Dr. Robert Trenton *Elizabeth Lackey as Dra.

Boa was a critical failure, with reviews citing bad acting and poor special effects. ==Sequel== Boa vs. Python was released after the success of the Python franchise and the failure of Boa; Boa vs. Python was also a critical failure. The filmmakers had decided to make a crossover with Python and Boa, involving the two types of snakes fighting each other. It has been noted that Boa vs. Python was inspired by Alien vs. Predator (2004). ==Release== Both the DVD and VHS versions have been out of print as of 2010, but they can be found online and at Netflix. ==See also== * List of killer snake films ==External links== * Category:2002 television films Category:2002 films Category:2002 horror films Category:2000s action thriller films Category:Natural horror films Category:Films about snakes Category:American prison films Category:American films Category:2000s prison films Category:Giant monster films Category:Horror television films Category:Films set in Antarctica Category:Sony Pictures direct-to-video films ",
