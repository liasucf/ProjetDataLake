Selected U.S. Naturalization Records - Original Documents, 1790-1974 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2009. was an American rabbi and dean of the worldwide Kabbalah Centre organization. Berg was a great populariser of Ashlagian Kabbalah. Having written a number of books on the subject of Kabbalah, Berg expanded its access to a greater audience than traditionally permitted, one which included secular Jews, non-Jews and women. Berg initially aimed at returning alienated Jews to their heritage through the teachings of Yehuda Ashlag, however he later adopted a more universalitic approach. There is disagreement about whether Berg's teachings, as relayed through the Kabbalah Centre, have sufficient grounds and/or genuine authority according to halakha (Jewish law), as they include some dogmas and translations differing markedly from those of more-traditional Kabbalists. Some Jewish scholars emphatically reject such teachings, deeming them as foreign to both the Kabbalah in particular and to Judaism in general. In poor health following a stroke in 2004, Berg died on September 16, 2013. ==Biography== Berg was born as Shraga Feivel Gruberger in 1929 in Brooklyn, to an Orthodox Jewish family.Udovich, Mim. \"Kabbalah Chronicles: Inside Hollywood's hottest cult\", Radar Online, June 15, 2005. (Copy at ) His father, Max Gruberger, immigrated from Nadvorna, Galicia (now in Ukraine), and worked as a clothes presser in Williamsburg. In his youth, Berg underwent Talmudic education at Lakewood Yeshiva under Aharon Kotler.28 Questions and Answers About Kabbalah - Kabbalah Learning Centre 1992 He later returned to Williamsburg, where in 1951 at age 22 he received ordination from Yeshiva Torah Vodaas. Berg went into the business world and worked as an insurance agent for New York Life. He also became involved in real estate, and by 1962 it is claimed he was a millionaire. It is likely that he began to be called Philip during this time, as it is usual practice among jews with Yiddish names to use an English equivalent to be more comfortable in a secular environment. Bergs first wife, Rivkah Brandwein, had an uncle named Yehuda Brandwein, whom Berg first met on a trip to Israel in 1962. Brandwein, a Hasidic rabbi from the Stretiner Hasidic dynasty and a close student in the Kabbalistic circle around Yehuda Ashlag, would become Berg's Kabbalistic mentor. Brandwein was the head of the Religious Department of the Israeli national workers union, Histadrut, and established Yeshivat Kol Yehuda (named after Ashlag) as a continuation of his mentor's yeshiva/publishing house \"Beit Ulpana Itur Rabbanim\". The uniqueness of Kol Yehuda was that students focused on kabbalistic study. The students would receive a salary to cover their living expenses so they could devote themselves to full-time learning. However, Brandwein faced difficulty in finding funds for the yeshiva and publishing. Berg had become Brandwein's book distributor and fund raiser in the United States, and it is likely he was encouraged by Brandwein to establish the \"National Institute for the Research in Kabbalah\" in New York in 1965 to aid the yeshiva. Berg was studying with another of Ashlag's American students, Levi I. Krakovsky, of Brooklyn. Krakovsky was interested in publishing his books through the National Institute, but Brandwein did not agree. In Brandwein's letters to Berg, he also clarified that he did not encourage seeking or accepting funds from non-Jews for the yeshiva, as this was forbidden according to halakha. Eventually, Brandwein allowed Berg to teach one student Kabbalah, and in 1966 Berg received an additional rabbinic ordination from Brandwein which certified his knowledge of Kabbalah, conferring him to the highest rabbinical rank. After Brandwein's death in 1969, Berg returned to the United States and began working again with his former secretary (and future wife) Karen, on the condition that she let him teach her Kabbalah, a discipline he claimed was reserved exclusively for men. In 1971, Philip and Karen married and traveled to Israel. It was there that they changed their surname from Gruberger to Berg, as it was a common practice to shorten a European Jewish surname upon moving to Israel. In 1973, the Bergs returned to Queens, New York, where they established their full-time headquarters during the 1980s. Philip Berg's grave in the 177x177px Berg, who had been ill since suffering a stroke in 2004, died on September 16, 2013. He was generally reported to be 86 (although the Los Angeles Times reported that according to public records he was 84). He is survived by his wife Karen and two sons, Yehuda and Michael, who have led the Kabbalah Centre since his stroke. He also had eight children from his first marriage. ==The Research Centre of Kabbalah== In July 1965, Berg was initially involved in the founding of a publishing house called \"The National Institute for the Research in Kabbalah\"The Kabbalah Centre and Contemporary Spirituality Jody Myers along with Aslag's American student Levi Krakovsky, who died the following year. This Institute was most likely a fundraising branch of Brandwein\u2019s Yeshiva Kol Yehuda, as books published by the Institute have Brandwein named as the senior figure, while Berg was listed as its president. Old City of Jerusalem|240x240px Krakovsky was an emissary of Ashlag\u2019s yeshiva \"Itur Rabbanim\",Krakovsky, If eventually - why not now? Kabbalah Foundation (1936). and had translated some of Ashlag\u2019s writings into English to support the yeshiva. He also wrote his own English introductory books to Kabbalah, and in the 1930s established his own yeshiva in the United States for the purpose of teaching Kabbalah in English. Krakovsky\u2019s writings were also published by the new Institute. In 1970, Berg legally changed the name of the National Institute to \"The Research Centre of Kabbalah\", establishing it as an independent Centre and publishing books of his own. His writings ranged from a basic introduction and explanation of Lurianic and Ashlagian Kabbalah to astrology and reincarnation. In 1971, Berg moved to Israel where he strengthened the Centre, gave lectures and disseminated his books. In 1980, he established a yeshiva, \"Or Hozer le\u2019Limud ha-Nigleh ve ha-Nistar\" (Returning Light for the Study of the Revealed and the Concealed) in Tel Aviv, which circulated various kabbalistic works. On his return to the United States in 1984 with a number of Israeli students called the \"Hevre\" (friends), Berg expanded the Centre to more locations. The aim of the now independent Research Centre was to resolve a widespread spiritual crisis affecting Jews, where many found traditional Judaism dry and unfulfilling. Large numbers of young Jews were seeking eastern spiritual practices, involving themselves in dangerous cults or resorting to atheism. Berg, who believed Judaism was being taught dogmatically, was determined to show inquisitive soul searching Jews that the answers could be found in Kabbalah. === Controversy === There is some disagreement over who succeeded Brandwein as dean of the 80-year-old Yeshiva Kol Yehuda in Jerusalem. Berg has claimed to have replaced Brandwein, his ex- uncle-in-law by his first wife, in that role; that claim is disputed by Brandwein's son Avraham, who is the current dean. The Los Angeles Task Force on Cults and Missionaries claimed he was not affiliated with the yeshiva,Ellin, Abby; Sacks, Adam J. \"The Kabbalah Centre Wants your Heart - and your Money: The String that Binds\" in The Village Voice, August 11, 2004. although a letter sent to him by Brandwein in July 1968 indicated he was President of the yeshiva. In 2010, the Internal Revenue Service launched an investigation, reportedly investigating whether funds were directed to the personal enrichment of the Berg family, and subpoenaed financial records of the organization and two affiliated charities connected to Madonna. The Centre called the allegations \"merit-less\", and said it \"intends to defend the case vigorously\". ==Publications of Phillip S. Berg and The Research Centre of Kabbalah== *Philip S.
