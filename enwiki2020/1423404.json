He was taught how to use the astrolabe by Sarcephalus (Christopher Hauptfleisch), a librarian in Breslau (Wroc\u0142aw). He also studied astronomy and medicine at the University of Strassburg (Strasbourg).Ioan James. Remarkable Physicists: From Galileo to Yukawa. Cambridge University Press, 2004. Tigris, a constellation introduced around 1613 by Petrus Plancius, as depicted by Jakob Bartsch In 1624 Bartsch published a book titled Usus astronomicus planisphaerii stellati containing star charts that depicted six new constellations introduced around 1613 by Petrus Plancius on a celestial globe published by Pieter van den Keere. These six new constellations were Camelopardalis, Gallus, Jordanis, Monoceros (which he called Unicornu), Tigris and Vespa. He also mentioned but did not depict Rhombus, a separate invention by Isaac Habrecht II. Bartsch was often wrongly credited with having invented these figures. Only Camelopardalis and Monoceros survive today.Jacob Bartsch and seven new constellations \u2013 Ian Ridpath's Star Tales Bartsch married Johannes Kepler's daughter Susanna on 12 March 1630James A.
