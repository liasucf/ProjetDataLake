    "text": "Mezzotint by Dunkarton & Ward after W. R. Bigg, The Soldier's Widow, dated 1800. Note the two cricket bats on the left. 1800 was the 14th season of cricket in England since the foundation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). It is one of the more difficult seasons to analyse because of several matches involving prominent town clubs like Rochester, Woolwich, Homerton, Richmond, Storrington, Montpelier and Thames Ditton. ==Honours== * Most runsNote that scorecards created in the 18th century are not necessarily accurate or complete; therefore any summary of runs, wickets or catches can only represent the known totals and the missing data prevents computation of averages \u2013 William Barton 226 (HS 51) * Most wickets \u2013 John Ward 47 (BB 7\u2013?) ==Events== * Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) made revisions to the Laws of Cricket which were republished in their entirety.Haygarth, pages 266\u2013267. * Robert Robinson is believed to have been the first batsman to try to introduce leg guards but his experiment was unsuccessful.Bowen, page 268. * John Ward had an outstanding debut season by scoring 213 runs, taking 47 wickets and holding 9 catches. He was the leading bowler, second highest run-scorer and one of the best fielders. * William Beldham with 11 ct, 1 st was the leading fielder in 1800, just ahead of Thomas Ray who took 11 ct. Nottingham wicket-keeper Joseph Dennis made an impression with 3 ct, 7 st. John Ward took 9 catches in addition to his 47 wickets. * Two matches between northern teams were significant in terms of the spread of cricket throughout England. Nottingham v Sheffield was the first known 11-a-side game involving a Yorkshire county team. In the Leicester v Nottingham match, Leicester was dismissed for 15 and 8, an aggregate of 23 which Rowland Bowen described as \"probably the lowest recorded aggregate for both innings in an important match\". * Cricket may have been feeling the impact of Great Britain's war against the Napoleonic Empire through a loss of investment which was reducing the number of first-class matches with only 7 recognised in 1800. ==First-class matches== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! style=\"width:125px; text-align:left;\"| Date ! style=\"width:250px; text- align:left;\"| Match Title ! style=\"width:125px; text-align:left;\"| Venue ! style=\"width:200px; text-align:left;\"| Result |- | 19\u201321 May (M\u2013W) | R Whitehead's XI v J Gibbons' XIHaygarth, page 267.CricketArchive \u2013 match scorecard.
