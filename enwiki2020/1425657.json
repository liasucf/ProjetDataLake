Ryerson used to have a football team which was coached, for much of its existence, by former Toronto Argonauts player Ted Toogood, who also served as Ryerson's first Athletic Director from 1949 to 1961. In 1958, the Rams won the Intermediate Intercollegiate Ontario-Quebec Conference championship. The football program was ended following the 1964 season due to costs, the lack of proper facilities, and poor attendance. == Championships == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Sport !National Championship !National Appearance !Conference Championship |- |Men's Basketball |0 |7 (1999, 2012, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019) |2 (2016, 2017) |- |Women's Basketball |0 |4 (2015, 2016, 2019, 2020) |1 (2016) |- |Women's Volleyball |1 (2018) |4 (2002, 2017, 2018, 2019) |1 (2018) |- |Men's Volleyball |0 |1 (2016) |0 |- |Men's Soccer |0 |1 (2013) |0 |} ==Facilities== Until the end of the 2011-2012 season, the Rams' basketball and volleyball teams played primarily out of Kerr Hall West Gymnasium, a triple gym in Kerr Hall West. The men's hockey team also played off campus, using the ice rinks at George Bell Arena in The Junction. The men's and women's soccer teams play their home games at Downsview Park Sports Centre near York University. In November 2009, Ryerson University announced that Maple Leaf Gardens would become the new home of the Rams' athletes. The school partnered with the Canadian Government and supermarket company Loblaws to cover funding for the project. Approximately $20 million was contributed by Ryerson students, $20 million given by Federal Government and $15 million from Peter Gilligan. In addition, Loblaws, the grocery retailer, made significant financial contributions. The renovation took place over nearly three years, with the ground level hosting a Loblaws Supermarket, connected with the Loblaw Atrium and floor two through four holding the Ryerson Ram's facilities which include: an NHL-sized ice rink, known as Mattamy Home Ice, a fitness centre as well as a multipurpose court for basketball and volleyball called the Coca- Cola Court. BBB Architects & Stadium Consultants International has designed the new facility - the Mattamy Athletic Centre at the Gardens - which was completed in time for the 2012-13 OUA season. == Awards and Honours == The Ryerson Rams have seen numerous awards given out to student athletes across a multitude of sports. ===Mens Basketball - U SPORTS/CIS/CIAU Honours=== * Tevaun Kokko - U SPORTS Second Team All-Canadian (2019-2020) * Jean-Victor Mukama - U SPORTS Second Team All-Canadian (2018-2019) * Ammanuel Diressa - U SPORTS First Team All-Canadian (2017-2018) * Adika Peter-McNeilly - U SPORTS First Team All-Canadian (2016-2017) * Aaron Best - U SPORTS Second Team All- Canadian (2015-2016) * Patrick Tatham - CIS Coach of the Year (2015-2016) * Jahmal Jones - U SPORTS Second Team All-Canadian (2014-2015) * Jahmal Jones - CIS All-Rookie Team (2010-2011) * Boris Bokovic - CIS All-Roookie Team (2006-2007) * Bill Crowdis - CIS All-Canadian Honourable Mention (1999-2000) * Alex Beason - CIS Second Team All-Canadian (1993-1994, 1994-1995) === Mens Basketball - OUA/OUAA Honours === * Tanor Ngom - OUA All-Rookie Team (2017-2018) * Keevon Small - OUA All-Rookie Team (2016-2017) * Patrick Tatham - OUA Coach of the Year (2015-2016) * Jean-Victor Mukama - OUA East Rookie of the Year (2013-2014) * Boris Bakovic - OUA East Rookie of the Year (2006-2007) * Terry Haggerty - OUA East Coach of the Year (1999-2000) * John-Michael Nation - OUA East Playoffs Most Valuable Player (1998-1999) * Ben Gorham - OUA East Rookie of the Year (1998-1999) * Alex Beason - OUAA East Most Valuable Player (1993-1994) * Phil Scholte - OUA East Coach of the Year (1980-1981) === Women's Basketball - U SPORTS/CIS/CIAU Honours === * Sofia Paska - U SPORTS Second Team All-Canadian (2017-2018) * Marrin Scotten - U SPORTS All-Rookie Team (2017-2018) * Sofia Paska - U SPORTS Second Team All-Canadian (2016-2017) * Keneca Pingue-Giles - CIS First Team All-Canadian (2015-2016) * Keneca Pingue-Giles - CIS Player of the Year (2015-2016) * Cassandra Nofuente - CIS All-Rookie Team (2012-2013) * Mandi-May Bond - CIS All-Rookie Team (1998-1999) * Darcel Wright - CIS Rookie of the Year (1990-1991) === Women's Basketball - OUA/OUAA Honours === * Marin Scotten - OUA Rookie of the Year (2017-2018) * Nicole DiDomenico - Joy Bellinger Award of Merit (2016-17) * Keneca Pingue- Giles - OUA Player of the Year (2015-2016) * Keneca Pingue-Giles - OUA Defensive Player of the Year (2015-2016) * Cassandra Nofuente - OUA East Rookie of the Year (2012-2013) * Lisa Greig - Joy Bellinger Award of Merit (2006-07) * Ashley Keohan - Joy Bellinger Award of Merit (2003-04) === Women's Volleyball - U SPORTS/CIS/CIAU Honours === * Cailin Wark - U SPORTS First Team All-Canadian (2019-2020) * Jasmine Rivest - U SPORTS All-Rookie Team (2019-2020) * Theanna Vernon - U SPORTS Athlete of the Year Finalist (2018-2019) * Theanna Vernon - U SPORTS First Team All-Canadian (2018-2019) * Lauren Wong - U SPORTS All-Rookie Team (2018-2019) * Dustin Reid - U Sports Coach of the Year (2018-2019) * Theanna Vernon - U SPORTS Athlete of the Year Finalist (2017-2018) * Theanna Vernon - U SPORTS Second Team All-Canadian (2017-2018) * Veronica Livingston - CIS All-Rookie Team (2012-2013) * Chelsea Briscoe - CIS All-Rookie Team (2011-2012) === Women's Volleyball OUA/OUAA Honours === * Cailin Wark - OUA East Most Valuable Player (2019-2020) * Jasmine Rivest - OUA East Rookie of the Year (2019-2020) * Dustin Reid - OUA East Coach of the Year (2019-2020) * Theanna Vernon - OUA East Most Valuable Player (2018-2019) * Lauren Wong - OUA East Rookie of the Year (2018-2019) * Dustin Reid - OUA East Coach of the Year (2018-2019) * Dustin Reid - OUA East Coach of the Year (2017-2018) * Julie Longman - Dale Iwanoczko Award of Merit (2017-2018) * Theanna Vernon - OUA East Rookie of the Year (2014-2015) * Julie Longman - OUA East Libero of the Year (2013-2014) * Dustin Reid - OUA East Coach of the Year (2009-2010) * Brianne Koning - OUA East Rookie of the Year (2004-2005) * Arif Nathoo - OUA East Coach of the Year (1999-2000) ==Logos== alt= Since Ryerson opened in 1948, the logo for the Rams has changed along with the former technical institute becoming a university.
