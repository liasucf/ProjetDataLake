Named for the chef Paul Bocuse, the event takes place during two days near the end of January in Lyon, France at the SIRHA International Hotel, Catering and Food Trade Exhibition, and is one of the world's most prestigious cooking competitions.Chavich, Cinda, The Globe and Mail (May 14, 2008).

Paul Bocuse, appointed Honorary President of the exhibition, conceived the idea of a culinary competition to take place during the exhibition, with preparation of all dishes taking place live in front of an audience. Several gastronomy contests were already in existence, however none of them presented a \"live performance\" and consequently one could not actually see the work performed in the kitchens of the chefs' restaurants.bocusedorasia.com History of the Bocuse d'Or The initial Bocuse d'Or took place in January 1987.Warwick, Joe, The Independent (July 20, 2008).

Beyond the Bocuse d\u2019Or also arranges other contests of culinary skill, including the Coupe du Monde de la P\u00e2tisserie (World Pastry Cup) and in recent years Mondial du Pain (World of Bread Contest). The audience atmosphere of the Bocuse d'Or evolved in 1997 when the support for the Mexican candidate included a mariachi band, foghorns, cowbells, cheering and yelling from the stands, marking the beginning of a tradition of noisy spectator presence.Hallock, Betty, Los Angeles Times: Daily Dish (January 27, 2009).

In 2017 the U.S. won the competition, finishing ahead of Norway in second place and Iceland in third. The team's head chef was Mathew Peters and his commis, or helper, was Harrison Turone. Both had previously worked at Keller's New York City restaurant Per Se. ===Semi-finals=== After its 20th anniversary, the format was expanded, with the first Bocuse d'Or Asia contest taking place in May 2008 in Shanghai and Bocuse d'Or Europe in July 2008 in Stavanger.

However, the Spanish candidate finished in the next to last place (a cited reason was that the warm dish produced such condensation to the inside of the egg that the judges were nearly unable to see the presentation), producing heated reactions from the Spanish delegation who called the jury old-fashioned and outdated, and members of the Spanish media who claimed that the chauvinistic jury despised the creativity of Spanish cooking and called the Bocuse d'Or a competition for buffet and catering.Portero, Pilar El Mundo (January 28, 2005).

Doble decepci\u00f3n en el concurso Bocuse d'Or Controversy arose during the 2007 Bocuse d'Or, as allegations of cheating were raised against the winning chef Fabrice Desvignes, due to the late delivery of two metal containers leading to claims that these contained prepared precooked ingredients.Bremner, Charles. Tourres, Marie. The Times (January 29, 2007). We were whipped by cheat chef, say the losing cooks A contest director responded that the containers were delivered to Desvignes two minutes before he started work because snow delayed their overnight arrival, and these contained silverware and foie gras, not prohibited by the rules. Two days later the German daily newspaper Die Welt published the article \"Gourmet-Skandal: Ist der weltbeste Koch wirklich ein Franzose?\" (Gourmet Scandal: Is the World's Best Chef Really a Frenchman?), featuring testimony by the German assistant chef Khabbaz Hicham who described four men that brought black crates with prepared and semi-prepared ingredients, an hour and thirty minutes into the competition.de Frumerie, Mattias, Restaurant\u00f6ren (February 22, 2007).

Furthermore, 3 entrants are selected from national application, as well as 2 wild card selections. Each team consists of two chefs, one lead chef, and a commis/assistant chef who must be under 22 years of age at the time of the competition. The team has 5 hours and 35 minutes to prepare two elaborate presentations, a meat dish and a fish dish.Houck, Jeff, The Tampa Tribune (September 24, 2008). A Top Chef Looks Ahead To America's Next GenerationLa Rose, Lauren, The Canadian Press (May 28, 2008). Canadian chef to battle for culinary honours Taking place in an open \"culinary theatre\", fully equipped kitchens are lined up side by side, facing an area for the jury, members of the press and audiences, with spectator numbers limited to ca. 1,000 people. From the 2009 contest, a designated coach located on the outside of the kitchen area is permitted to communicate with the team. Also as of 2009, inspectors control equipment and products the backstage zone, as no vegetables may be pre-cut, although teams may pre-peel garlic, portion oil, salt, flour and other ingredients, and bring stocks made in advance.Sciolino, Elaine; Katz, Basil, The New York Times: Diner's Journal (January 27, 2009). Blogging the Bocuse d\u2019Or Competition The jury consists of 24 renowned chef judges who make their evaluations based on the level of perfection in the presentation, in terms of technical skill, cooking sophistication, creativity and visual beauty. The jury is divided into two groups of 12, each half to judge either the fish dish or the meat dish. The food's quality determines two-thirds of the score, 40 points; presentation determines 20 points. In the event of a tie, another 20 points will be awarded based on factors such as organization, teamwork, cleanliness and lack of waste. Judges have included Heston Blumenthal, Ferran Adri\u00e0, Wolfgang Puck, Eyvind Hellstr\u00f8m, Thomas Keller and past winners such as Fabrice Desvignes, Mathias Dahlgren and L\u00e9a Linster. The Bocuse d'Or trophies The chef with the highest overall score is awarded the Bocuse d'Or trophy, a golden effigy of Paul Bocuse in his chef's outfit, receiving the grand prize of \u20ac20,000. The Silver Bocuse medalist receives \u20ac15,000, and the Bronze Bocuse medalist receives \u20ac10,000. Additional prizes are awarded for the best fish and meat dishes, best national culinary identity, best apprentice and best posters. ===2013 rule changes=== Ahead of the 2013 event, a set of alterations to the rules were announced in November 2012. In contrast to previous years when the fish and meat themes were announced six months ahead of the finals, the announcement of the fish theme was withheld until two months before the competition in order to \"encourage the chefs to display even more creativity and spontaneity.\"Rodbard, Matt, Food Republic (November 26, 2012). Bocuse d\u2019Or Competition Announces Fish Course, Other Top Cheffian Changes At this time, other changes were announced concerning the allowed condiments, that \"on the eve of the contest, the candidates will have 30 minutes to choose seasonal fruit and vegetables from the five continents market\" to prepare two of the three garnishes in the contest, and the third garnish would be \"typical of the candidates\u2019 respective countries,\" with an aim to \"highlight the different national culinary heritages and encourage diversity\". Further changes describe that the candidates with their coach and commis, having acquired the ingredients, \"will have one hour in which to design and write down the recipe for their dish\". Finally, the competitions depart from the large tray presentation format of previous years as the candidates this time are required to prepare fourteen plates \"in order to remain close to the actual restaurant environment.\" ==Medalists== Geir Skeie, winner of the 2008 Bocuse d'Or Europe and 2009 Bocuse d'Or {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- !Year !Bocuse d'Or !Silver Bocuse !Bronze Bocuse |- |1987 | Jacky Freon | Michel Addons | Hans Haas |- |1989 | L\u00e9a Linster | Pierre Paulus | William Wai |- |1991 | Michel Roth | Lars Erik Underthun | Gert Jan Raven |- |1993 | Bent Stiansen | Jens Peter Kolbeck | Guy Van Cauteren |- |1995 | R\u00e9gis Marcon | Melker Andersson | Patrick Jaros |- |1997 | Matthias Dahlgren | Roland Debuyst | Odd Ivar Solvold |- |1999 | Terje Ness | Yannick Alleno | Ferdy Debecker |- |2001 | Fran\u00e7ois Adamski | Henrik Norstr\u00f6m | H\u00e1kon M\u00e1r \u00d6rvarsson |- |2003 | Charles Tjessem | Frank Putelat | Claus Weitbrecht |- |2005 | Serge Vieira | Tom Victor Gausdal | Rasmus Kofoed |- |2007 | Fabrice Desvignes | Rasmus Kofoed | Frank Giovannini |- |2009 | Geir Skeie | Jonas Lundgren | Philippe Mille |- |2011 | Rasmus Kofoed | Tommy Myllym\u00e4ki | Gunnar Hvarnes |- |2013 | Thibaut Ruggeri | Jeppe Foldager | Noriyuki Hamada |- |2015 | \u00d8rjan Johannessen | Philip Tessier | Tommy Myllym\u00e4ki |- |2017 | Mathew Peters | Christopher William Davidsen | Viktor \u00d6rn Andr\u00e9sson |- |2019 | Kenneth Toft-Hansen | Sebastian Gibrand | Christian Andr\u00e9 Pettersen |} ==References== * List of prizewinners ; ; Bocusedor.com ;Footnotes ==External links== *Bocuse d'Or official site Category:gastronomy Category:Cooking competitions in France Category:Recurring events established in 1987 Category:1987 establishments in France ",
