    "text": "Hagar International is a Swiss-based global humanitarian nonprofit organization offering services and assistance to people who have escaped sexual slavery and/or human trafficking in Cambodia, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Singapore. It is focused on helping victims with recovery, and was founded in Cambodia in 1994 by Pierre Tami. Hagar started providing services to Afghanistan and Vietnam in 2009. It expanded to Myanmar in 2014. Hagar International has been noted for working with male victims in addition to women and children. A main goal is to help victims achieve stability and financial independence though skill-based training and job opportunity programs. Hagar International recommends an ongoing process which starts with the victim, then the victim's family, and finally helps integrate them into the community. The organization often works directly with local and federal governments to improve social services. Several children from their special \"catch-up\" schools have been able to graduate and go to university. They have a legal protection unit, which was established in 2011, and helps provide legal services and representation in court. Hagar International was named after the biblical character Hagar from Genesis 16-21. Hagar, a slave, was raped and impregnated by her master, then abused by her master's jealous wife. Hagar ran away, but was forced by God to go back to slavery and bear her master's son. Hagar International's goal is to help people like Hagar who are suffering from sexual abuse. == References == Category:Non-profit organisations based in Cambodia Category:International non-profit organizations ",
