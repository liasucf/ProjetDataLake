    "text": "The Huntington Hotel is one of the landmark luxury hotels at the top of the Nob Hill district of San Francisco, California. It is located at 1075 California Street, corner of Taylor Street. The hotel is a twelve-story, Georgian-style brick building that features 135 guest rooms and suites. == Description == The hotel is named after Collis P. Huntington, one of the Big Four railroad tycoons of the Old West. However, it is across California Street from the location of Huntington's mansion, on the site of a mansion owned by the Tobin family, founders of the Hibernia Bank. It was originally designed by Weeks and Day as the Huntington Apartments in 1922, and was converted to a hotel by real estate developer Eugene Fritz, who bought the property in 1924. Fritz's grandchildren ran the hotel until selling it in 2011 to Singapore- based Grace International. The hotel closed on January 4, 2014 and reopened in May 2014 as The Scarlet Huntington, following a $15 million renovation. It was sold on September 28, 2018, to Los Angeles-based Woodridge Capital and returned to its historic name, the Huntington Hotel.https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Investor-buys-fourth- historic-hotel-atop-SF-s-13264664.php == References == == External links == * * Category:Hotels in San Francisco Category:Landmarks in San Francisco Category:Nob Hill, San Francisco Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1922 Category:Weeks and Day buildings Category:Historic Hotels Worldwide ",
