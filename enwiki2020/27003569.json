The program premiered on 9 July 2016 and runs from 7am to 10am (AEST) on Saturday mornings. It was originally planned to have the show break out for 30 minutes to allow Pyne & Marles to air, however that program was moved to Friday afternoons after Saturday Edition premiered. The program replaces the bulk of First Edition as Sky News' breakfast program. The program was hosted by Paul Murray, along with Paul Murray Live. Coinciding with the launch of Saturday Edition, the Friday episode of Paul Murray Live became a highlights package of scenes from the previous week. In 2016, Jaynie Seal presented news updates and Jim Callinan presented sport. In 2017, Caroline Marcus was added as co-host of the program and Greg Thomson replaced Callinan as sports presenter, while Seal exited. From 4 March 2017, Seal and Thomson became main anchors of the program, with both Murray and Marcus exiting without notice. The pair also host Sunday Edition from 7am AEDT, but the program is 60 minutes in duration, prior to Speers On Sunday. == References == ==External links== *Sky News Official site Category:Sky News Australia Category:Australian non- fiction television series Category:English-language television shows Category:2016 Australian television series debuts ",
