Upon the establishment of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia Jolly was elected a member of the first Board. He was the director of the National Bank of Australia after it merged with the Queensland National Bank. He was councillor of Kings College at the University of Queensland, a member of the Board for the YMCA and a long-term member of the Brisbane Rotary Club. He was elected an alderman of the Windsor Town Council in 1912, becoming the Mayor between 1918 and 1923. In 1925, the present City of Brisbane was created through the amalgamation of the city (which previously covered only the innermost suburbs) with all of the local government areas that contained its suburbs (known as the Greater Brisbane scheme). Jolly was elected the first Lord Mayor of Brisbane in 1925 and held that role until 1931. After seven years of agitation, Brisbane's tram service was extended to Grange in July 1928. The opening ceremony was attended by Jolly, and two Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, James Stevingstone Kerr and Charles Taylor. The mayor had previously threatened not to attend any ceremony for the opening of the tram service because two rival groups were organising separate celebrations; he would only attend if there was a single ceremony. In 1928, artist Caroline Barker painted a portrait of Lord Mayor of Brisbane William Jolly in his mayoral robes and exhibited it at the Royal Queensland Art Society. Charles Herbert Gough was so impressed by the work that he initiated a public subscription to purchase the portrait as a gift for the mayor from the citizens of Brisbane. As Jolly was a popular mayor, the public were generous in their donations and the portrait was presented to the mayor in December 1928 together with a string of pearls for his wife, the Lady Mayoress. During his time as Lord Mayor, Jolly was responsible for many civic developments, especially the arterial road network in Brisbane. The Grey Street Bridge (renamed the William Jolly Bridge shortly after his death) was built during his time in office. In 1937 and 1940, he stood and was elected the UAP member for the Federal Division of Lilley.
