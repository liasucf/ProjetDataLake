He moved to Lille with his family in 1853. From an early age he showed an interest in art and became a student of Alphonse Colas at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Lille, winning a gold medal in 1867. From 1868 a grant from the D\u00e9partement du Nord allowed him to continue his studies in Paris at the famous \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts in the studio of Alexandre Cabanel. There he came under the influence of orientalism. Comerre first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1871 and went on to win prizes there in 1875 and 1881. In 1875, he won the Grand Prix de Rome for his painting \"L\u2019Ange annon\u00e7ant aux bergers la naissance du Christ\" (The Angel announcing the birth of Christ to the shepherds). This led to a scholarship at the French Academy in Rome from January 1876 to December 1879. In 1885 he won a prize at the \"Exposition Universelle\" in Antwerp. He also won prestigious art prizes in the USA (1876) and Australia (1881 and 1897). He became a Knight of the Legion of Honour in 1903.Archives nationales (France), Base de donn\u00e9es L\u00e9onore, L\u00e9gion d'Honneur He exhibited in London at the Royal Academy and the Royal Society of Portrait Painters, and in Glasgow at the Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts.Short Biog (Jeffery Winter Fine Arts).
