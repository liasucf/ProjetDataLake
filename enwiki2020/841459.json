The latest data issued by the country's government is used, and those subdivisions which are the largest in their respective countries are shown in bold. Countries which have a high proportion of their population enumerated in the largest subdivision include the United Kingdom (80.3% in England) and Pakistan (53.7% in Punjab). England appears on this list but does not have a single government because it is a constituent country. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ |- ! Rank !! Subdivision !! Country !! Capital !! !!

and they go by many names, such as counties, districts, divisions, and regions, but these names vary by country. The list below displays every single second-level subnational division in the world with a population over 10 million, as well as what they are called (a district, county, region?), area, density, the country and first-level subdivision they belong to, the date the population figure dates from, and a country of comparable population size. Only districts and divisions that have a unified administration or government of any kind are listed, so for example, non-governmental statistical regions, such as Media Markets or Combined Statistical Areas in the U.S. are excluded, but Indian Divisions, as they involve some form of administration (mostly concerning revenue), are included. The table below is under construction, and only consists of certain Chinese prefectures, U.S. Counties, Pakistani Divisions, and Indian Divisions at the moment.
