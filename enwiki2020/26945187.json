The environs of Benwee Head (Gaelic: An Bhinn Bhu\u00ed 'the yellow cliff') County Mayo, with its cliffs, arches, stacks and islands, offers some of the most dramatic coastal scenery in Ireland. These cliffs tower over Broadhaven Bay in the Atlantic Ocean and there are way-marked cliff walking trails along them for which maps can be obtained from Comhar D\u00fan Chaoch\u00e1in Teo in Carrowteige. To appreciate the cliffs fully, you need to see them from the sea. Benwee Head is in the townland of Kilgalligan in the parish of Kilcommon, Erris, a townland whose microtoponyms (field place names) and folklore traditions has been studied in detail in the 1975 book, The Living Landscape: Kilgalligan.The Living Landscape: Kilgalligan, Erris, Co. Mayo by Seamas O Cathain & Patrick O'Flanagan An Bhinn Bhu\u00ed is the 1001st highest summit in Ireland and is all the more spectacular as its north sides drop vertically into the wild Atlantic Ocean. An Bhinn Bhu\u00ed is the most northerly summit in the North Mayo area. ==The north coast of Mayo== The remote and rugged north coast of Mayo is one of Ireland\u2019s best kept secrets. Its majestic cliffs, rugged headlands, rocky coves and jagged stacks are apparent only to those willing to walk away from the main thoroughfares to discover them. ==Dun Chaoch\u00e1in peninsula== The Dun Chaoch\u00e1in peninsula in Kilcommon parish, Erris is one of great physical beauty and has retained many of its old traditions and culture. The Irish language is still in full vigour as the vernacular. ==Dun Chaochain cliffs== The spectacular Dun Chaochain cliffs have featured in various walking guidebooks and walks during the summer periods are organised by Comhar D\u00fan Chaoch\u00e1in Teo in Carrowteige, the main village on the D\u00fan Chaoch\u00e1in peninsula. Benwee Head at 255m high is the crowning glory. ==Stags of Broadhaven== The Stags of Broadhaven (a group of four precipitous rocky islets rising to almost 100m) are located about 2 km north of Benwee Head and are a site of ornithological importance. ==Walks== The looped walk incorporates the Children of Lir Tir Saile sculpture. The well-known legend tells the tale of children who were turned into swans and condemned to wander the countryside for 900 years. The key feature of the loop is the black ditch \u2013 a dry ditch which runs parallel to the coastline and clifftops and probably marked the boundaries of lands in previous times. The looped walks along the cliffs are marked with red, green and blue arrows according to the type of walk the individual or group wishes to follow. ==Map data== Benwee Head Cliffs (Gaelic: An Bhinn Bhu\u00ed 'the yellow cliff'), County Mayo, Ireland. * Height: 304 metres * OS 1/50k Mapsheet: 22 for top * Grid Ref: F816 443 * Latitude: 54.333659 * Longitude: -9.820924 * ITM: 481576 844301 * Prominence: 230m * Isolation: 5.4 km ==See also== *Glinsk *Glengad *Rossport *Carrowteige *Comhar D\u00fan Chaoch\u00e1in Teo *Erris *Kilcommon *Broadhaven Bay *Sruwaddacon Bay ==References== ==Further reading== * Ireland - things to see and do * Ni Gearraigh, T.
