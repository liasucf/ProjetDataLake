She then passed her Second State Examination in 1933, but was not allowed to work as a lawyer or assessor following the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, twhichhat targeted Jews in civil service.

She moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1937 to work as a secretary for Harry Shulman at Yale University. After completing law school, Wallach worked as a cataloger at the law library at the University of Michigan. She became a US citizen in 1942. She worked as a lawyer in Washington D.C. with the Office of Price Administration and then the National Labor Relations Board. She was also a member of the Wisconsin State Bar Association. After World War II, Wallach was an advisor on international legal aspects of war crimes. In 1947, she returned to librarianship at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In 1949 Wallach moved to Baton Rouge to be an assistant professor for the Louisiana State University law school. Also a member of the library at the law school, she increased the number of books from 75,000 to 205,464 by her retirement. She also conducted academic research, and published Bibliographical History of Louisiana Civil Law Sources, her most important work, in 1955, along with Research in Louisiana Law in 1958, and Union List of Basic Latin American Legal Materials in 1971. She became a chair of the library in 1964, and received a JD in 1966. She resigned from administrative work with the library in 1970.
