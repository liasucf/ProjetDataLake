    "text": "The Proclamation of the Birth of Christ, Kalenda Proclamation, or Christmas Proclamation, is a chant sung before the Midnight Mass for Christmas in the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church. The long text is a timeline, in which each verse represents the years from an historical event, either secular or religious, until birth of Jesus Christ, and the number of years \u2013 expressed in centuries or years \u2013 decreases until the day of the first Christmas. == Ceremonial == Originating from the Roman Martyrology, traditionally read during the hour of Prime, the proclamation places the birth of Christ \"within the context of salvation history.\" Prime was suppressed as part of the liturgical reforms following Vatican II, but Pope John Paul II restored the usage of the Proclamation during the 1980 Papal Christmas Midnight Mass. Since then, many parishes re-instituted the Proclamation as well. In the Ordinary Form of the Roman Rite, the Christmas Proclamation is chanted during Midnight Mass. ==Translations== As the official Latin text of the Roman Martyrology has been updated, the English translation of the Proclamation has changed as well. === 1584 text === {| |- !
