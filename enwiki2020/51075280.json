    "text": "The gens Lamponia was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome, known from only a few individuals. The most important was Marcus Lamponius, one of the leaders of the allies during the Social War. ==Members== * Marcus Lamponius, a native of Lucania, was one of the Italian commanders during the Social War. He defeated Publius Licinius Crassus, who was forced to retreat into Grumentum with considerable losses. An ally of Gaius Marius and the populares, Lamponius lived to see Sulla's victorious return in 82 BC, and prudently disappeared after the Battle of the Colline Gate together with many other persons fleeing the expected persecution.Frontinus, Strategemata, ii. 4, 16.Appian, Bellum Civile, i. 40, 41, 90, 93.Plutarch, \"The Life of Sulla\", 29.Florus, iii. 21.Eutropius, v. 8.Diodorus Siculus, xxxvii.
