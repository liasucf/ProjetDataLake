Ferguson Jenkins pitched a complete game and Glenn Beckert hit a home run. *April 14 \u2013 In his Major League debut, Billy Rohr of the Boston Red Sox has a no-hitter broken up with two out in the ninth inning\u2014and one strike to go\u2014of a 3-0 victory over the New York Yankees and Whitey Ford at Yankee Stadium. A single by Elston Howard breaks up the bid; this will be the only hit Rohr will allow. Exactly one week later, Rohr again defeats the Yankees in a complete game victory, this time at Fenway Park\u2014the second of: 1) the only two games Rohr will win this season and 2) the only three he will win as a Major Leaguer. *April 16 \u2013 At Busch Memorial Stadium, in the St. Louis Cardinals' fourth game of the season, Lou Brock hits two home runs in an 11-8 victory over the Houston Astros. With two home runs against the Los Angeles Dodgers the day before and a fifth against the San Francisco Giants on Opening Day, he becomes the first player to hit five home runs in his team's first four games of the regular season. *April 20 \u2013 Tom Seaver earns his first major league victory, 6-1, over the Chicago Cubs. *April 30 \u2013 Steve Barber and Stu Miller combine for a no-hitter, but the Detroit Tigers score twice in the ninth on walks, a wild pitch and an error for a 2-1 win over the Baltimore Orioles. ===May\u2013August=== *May 14 \u2013 The New York Yankees' Mickey Mantle becomes the 6th member of the 500-home run club in New York's 6-5 victory over the Baltimore Orioles at Yankee Stadium. Mantle connects while batting left-handed off Baltimore's Stu Miller. *May 16 \u2013 Carl Yastrzemski hits his 100th career home run in an 8-5 Boston Red Sox loss to the Baltimore Orioles at Fenway Park. *June 7 \u2013 Willie Stargell hits his 100th career home run helping Pittsburgh Pirates beat New York Mets 3-0. *June 15 \u2013 At the Astrodome, Jimmy Wynn becomes the first Houston Astro to hit three home runs in one game. The shots, all with the bases empty, come in the 4th, 6th and 8th innings of the Astros' 6-2 victory over the San Francisco Giants. *June 18 \u2013 At the Astrodome, Don Wilson of the Houston Astros no-hits the Atlanta Braves 2-0, the first no-hitter ever pitched either in a domed stadium or on artificial turf. Along the way, he records 15 strikeouts, including Hank Aaron for the final out. *July 2 \u2013 The Chicago Cubs moved into a tie for first place with the St. Louis Cardinals after defeating the Cincinnati Reds 4-1 before 40,464 at Wrigley Field. After the game, many in the crowd waited until the pennant flags on the scoreboard were rearranged with the Cubs flag placed on the top. It was the first time the Cubs were in first place since the 1945 season. *July 4 \u2013 The Niekro brothers face each other for the first time, with Phil Niekro pitching for the Atlanta Braves and Joe Niekro hurling for the Chicago Cubs. Phil beat Joe in an 8-3 decision in the first game of a double- header in Atlanta. The Braves also won the second game 4-2. *July 11 \u2013 At Anaheim Stadium, Tony P\u00e9rez ends the longest All-Star Game (15 innings, three hours and 41 minutes) with a home run off Catfish Hunter in a 2-1 National League victory over the American League. Solo homers by Richie Allen and the AL's Brooks Robinson account for the other runs, as P\u00e9rez is named MVP. *July 14 \u2013 Eddie Mathews of the Houston Astros becomes the seventh member of the 500 home run club. Juan Marichal of the San Francisco Giants serves up the home run; the first time in history a future Hall of Fame pitcher serves up a 500th home run. *July 25 \u2013 The Chicago Cubs lose 4-3 to the St. Louis Cardinals in St. Louis to drop into 2nd place, the Cubs would not regain first place for the rest of 1967. *August 18 \u2013 Tony Conigliaro of the Boston Red Sox is beaned by the California Angels' Jack Hamilton. Hit on the left cheekbone, just below the eye socket, Conigliaro will miss the rest of 1967 and all of 1968. He was hitting .267 with 20 home runs and 67 RBIs in 95 games in 1967. Despite the loss of Tony C., the Red Sox will sweep the four-game series with the Angels. The sweep, however, still leaves the Minnesota Twins in first place, with Boston, the Detroit Tigers and the Chicago White Sox all within two games. *August 20 \u2013 In the first game of a double header, Al Kaline hits his 300th career home run helping the Detroit Tigers beat the Cleveland Indians, 4-2. Kaline has another home run in the second game with Detroit winning, 4-0. *August 25 \u2013 Minnesota Twins pitcher Dean Chance no-hits the Cleveland Indians. He walks five and allows one run. Nineteen days earlier, Chance throws five perfect innings in a game shortened by rain. ===September\u2013December=== *September 10 \u2013 Joe Horlen of the Chicago White Sox no-hits the Detroit Tigers 6-0, in the first game of a doubleheader at Comiskey Park. The White Sox also shut out the Tigers in the nightcap, with Cisco Carlos gaining his first Major League victory, and pull into a third- place tie with the Tigers and within games of the first-place Minnesota Twins. *September 27 \u2013 In the tight AL pennant race, the possibility of a four-way tie is eliminated as the Twins and Red Sox both lose (5-1 to California and 6-0 to Cleveland, respectively). Minnesota now has a 91-69 won-lost record and Boston is 90-70, and the only games left for those two teams are two games against each other. *September 29 \u2013 The White Sox lose 1-0 to the Washington Senators and are eliminated from the AL pennant race. Chicago is now 89-71, and can win a maximum of 91 games, and must finish behind the Twins or the Red Sox (those two teams only have the two games against each other left to play). The only remaining tie possibilities are Twins-Tigers or Red Sox-Tigers. **Ferguson Jenkins wins his 20th game of the 1967 season with a 4-1 decision over the Cincinnati Reds in Cincinnati. It was the first of seven 20-win seasons for Jenkins in his career, six of which were with the Cubs. *October 1: **One of the closest American League pennant races ever enters the season's final day with the Red Sox and Twins tied for first place and the Tigers one- half game back. The Red Sox and Twins play a game against each other, with the winner clinching a tie for the pennant and the loser being eliminated. In that game, eventual American League MVP Carl Yastrzemski goes 4 for 4 as the Red Sox beat the Twins 5-3. The Tigers can tie the Red Sox if they sweep a doubleheader from the California Angels in Detroit. The Tigers win the first game 6-4, but their bullpen fails in the finale and the Angels win 8-5 to give the Red Sox the pennant with no playoff. **Today's doubleheader is the second in as many days for the Tigers and the Angels. The doubleheaders are the result of earlier postponements of games which are needed in the deciding of the pennant race. Many years later, also in the AL, there will be a case of a day doubleheader scheduled on the day after a twi-night doubleheader; there will be a player protest to AL president Bobby Brown, who will rule that there will be only one game on the second day. **For the first time since 1937 both Chicago teams succeed in winning at least 85 games during the regular season. For the Cubs it was only their 2nd winning season (1963 being the other one) since 1946. **In the Minnesota Twins' loss today (to Boston), their third baseman, C\u00e9sar Tovar, sets an American League season record by playing in 164 games. Maury Wills holds the NL record at 165 (1962). *October 5 \u2013 In Game 2 of the World Series, Boston's Jim Lonborg is brilliant as he retires the first 19 Cardinals before walking Curt Flood with one out in the seventh inning. His no-hit bid is broken up with two out in the eighth by a Juli\u00e1n Javier double. Lonborg has to settle for pitching the fourth one-hitter in World Series history as the Red Sox even the series with a 5-0 win. *October 12 \u2013 In Game Seven of the World Series, the St. Louis Cardinals earn their second World Championship of the decade with a 7\u20132 victory over pitcher Jim Lonborg and the Boston Red Sox. Pitcher Bob Gibson notches his third win in the Series with a three-hitter, in which he records 10 strikeouts and a fifth-inning home run, while outfielder Lou Brock has two hits and three stolen bases for a record seven steals in a seven-game World Series. *October 18: City officials from Kansas City, Oakland and Seattle were invited by Joe Cronin to discuss the A's relocation plans. United States Senator Stuart Symington attended the meeting and discussed the possibility of revoking baseball's antitrust exemption if the A's were allowed to leave Kansas City. The owners began deliberation and after the first ballot, only six owners were in favour of relocation. The owner of Baltimore voted against, while the ownership for Cleveland, New York and Washington had abstained.Charlie Finley: The Outrageous Story of Baseball's Super Showman, p.113, G. Michael Green and Roger D. Launius. Walker Publishing Company, New York, 2010, In the second ballot, the New York Yankees voted in favour of the Athletics relocation to Oakland. To appease all interested parties, the Athletics announced that MLB would expand to Kansas City and Seattle no later than the 1971 MLB season.Charlie Finley: The Outrageous Story of Baseball's Super Showman, p.114, G. Michael Green and Roger D. Launius. Walker Publishing Company, New York, 2010, *October 22 \u2013 Kansas City Athletics owner Charlie Finley hires Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio as the team's vice president. DiMaggio will also serve as a coach for the newly transplanted Oakland Athletics. DiMaggio needed two more years of baseball service to qualify for the league's maximum pension allowance.Charlie Finley: The Outrageous Story of Baseball's Super Showman, p.119, G. Michael Green and Roger D. Launius. Walker Publishing Company, New York, 2010, *November 22 \u2013 Minnesota Twins second baseman Rod Carew wins the American League Rookie of the Year Award. Receiving 19 of 20 first place votes, Carew easily outdistances Reggie Smith of the Boston Red Sox. *November 29 \u2013 The Chicago White Sox reacquire SS Luis Aparicio, along with OF Russ Snyder and 1B/OF John Matias, from the Baltimore Orioles, in exchange for pitchers Bruce Howard and Roger Nelson and IF Don Buford. ==Births== ===January=== *January 3 \u2013 Jimmy Rogers *January 4 \u2013 Ted Wood *January 4 \u2013 Clint Zavaras *January 5 \u2013 Chris Nabholz *January 7 \u2013 Rob Maurer *January 8 \u2013 Matt Maysey *January 8 \u2013 Randy Nosek *January 10 \u2013 Kevin Baez *January 11 \u2013 Nikco Riesgo *January 12 \u2013 Mike Simms *January 14 \u2013 Paul Fletcher *January 15 \u2013 Bill Wertz *January 22 \u2013 Kevin Higgins *January 26 \u2013 Jeff Branson *January 26 \u2013 Tim Pugh ===February=== *February 1 \u2013 Juan Guerrero *February 1 \u2013 Tim Naehring *February 1 \u2013 Hiromoto Okubo *February 9 \u2013 Todd Pratt *February 11 \u2013 John Patterson *February 11 \u2013 Scott Pose *February 13 \u2013 Eddie Pye *February 17 \u2013 Lonnie Maclin *February 18 \u2013 John Valentin *February 18 \u2013 Matt Turner *February 19 \u2013 Keith Kessinger *February 20 \u2013 Kurt Knudsen *February 26 \u2013 David Howard *February 26 \u2013 Scott Service ===March=== *March 8 \u2013 Lance Barksdale *March 8 \u2013 Joel Johnston *March 9 \u2013 Vince Horsman *March 11 \u2013 Dwayne Hosey *March 15 \u2013 Bobby Rose *March 16 \u2013 Don Florence *March 18 \u2013 Ken Edenfield *March 23 \u2013 Jerry Brooks *March 25 \u2013 Brian Barnes *March 26 \u2013 Jarvis Brown *March 26 \u2013 Shawn Hare *March 27 \u2013 Jaime Navarro *March 27 \u2013 Candy Sierra *March 28 \u2013 Shawn Boskie *March 28 \u2013 Larry Gonzales *March 29 \u2013 Brian Jordan *March 29 \u2013 Ger\u00f3nimo Pe\u00f1a ===April=== *April 3 \u2013 Miguel Garc\u00eda *April 3 \u2013 Danilo Le\u00f3n *April 5 \u2013 Greg Smith *April 6 \u2013 Tommy Greene *April 8 \u2013 Rich Batchelor *April 9 \u2013 Graeme Lloyd *April 10 \u2013 Mike Humphreys *April 14 \u2013 Mike Trombley *April 17 \u2013 Marquis Grissom *April 18 \u2013 Brian Dubois *April 20 \u2013 Greg Brummett *April 23 \u2013 Rheal Cormier *April 24 \u2013 Omar Vizquel *April 25 \u2013 Mike Sarbaugh *April 27 \u2013 Tony Eusebio ===May=== *May 5 \u2013 Charles Nagy *May 12 \u2013 Kenny Greer *May 15 \u2013 John Smoltz *May 16 \u2013 Doug Brocail *May 16 \u2013 Frank Seminara *May 18 \u2013 Eric Young *May 19 \u2013 Turk Wendell *May 24 \u2013 Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez *May 26 \u2013 Stacy Jones *May 29 \u2013 Bill Risley *May 31 \u2013 Kenny Lofton *May 31 \u2013 Bill Miller ===June=== *June 1 \u2013 James Hurst *June 2 \u2013 Mike Stanton *June 4 \u2013 Scott Servais *June 4 \u2013 Rick Wilkins *June 5 \u2013 Ray Lankford *June 6 \u2013 Ken Ramos *June 8 \u2013 Steve Chitren *June 11 \u2013 John Doherty *June 13 \u2013 Daren Brown *June 14 \u2013 Jerry Spradlin *June 14 \u2013 George Tsamis *June 14 \u2013 Brian Turang *June 23 \u2013 Hensley Meulens *June 27 \u2013 Lee Hancock *June 28 \u2013 Matt Karchner *June 28 \u2013 Ron Witmeyer *June 29 \u2013 John Wehner ===July=== *July 3 \u2013 Brian Cashman *July 4 \u2013 Vinny Castilla *July 5 \u2013 Tim Worrell *July 6 \u2013 Omar Olivares *July 10 \u2013 Lee Stevens *July 11 \u2013 Andy Ashby *July 11 \u2013 Donne Wall *July 13 \u2013 Pat Rapp *July 14 \u2013 Robin Ventura *July 21 \u2013 Lance Painter *July 25 \u2013 Ed Sprague ===August=== *August 1 \u2013 Gregg Jefferies *August 2 \u2013 Scott Taylor *August 4 \u2013 Steve Bieser *August 7 \u2013 Jason Grimsley *August 8 \u2013 Kevin Belcher *August 8 \u2013 Matt Whiteside *August 9 \u2013 Deion Sanders *August 10 \u2013 Chuck Carr *August 14 \u2013 Joe Grahe *August 15 \u2013 Mike James *August 16 \u2013 Bret Barberie *August 17 \u2013 Kelly Mann *August 19 \u2013 Scott Fredrickson *August 20 \u2013 Andy Benes *August 22 \u2013 Bill Welke *August 25 \u2013 Euclides Rojas *August 26 \u2013 Shinji Sasaoka *August 27 \u2013 Brian McRae *August 27 \u2013 Willie Smith *August 28 \u2013 Darren Lewis *August 31 \u2013 Stan Royer ===September=== *September 2 \u2013 Jamie McAndrew *September 3 \u2013 Luis Gonz\u00e1lez *September 12 \u2013 Pat Listach *September 13 \u2013 Rod Correia *September 15 \u2013 Paul Abbott *September 15 \u2013 Dennis Moeller *September 16 \u2013 John Ericks *September 19 \u2013 Jim Abbott *September 22 \u2013 John Briscoe *September 22 \u2013 P.
