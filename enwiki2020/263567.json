The exception was during the COVID-19 pandemic. Located in the historic Beyo\u011flu (Pera) district, it is an elegant pedestrian street, long, which houses boutiques, music stores, bookstores, art galleries, cinemas, theatres, libraries, caf\u00e9s, pubs, nightclubs with live music, historical patisseries, chocolateries and restaurants. The avenue, surrounded by late Ottoman era buildings (mostly from the 19th and early 20th centuries) that were designed with the Neo-Classical, Neo-Gothic, Renaissance Revival, Beaux- Arts, Art Nouveau and First Turkish National Architecture styles; as well as a few Art Deco style buildings from the early years of the Turkish Republic, and a number of more recent examples of modern architecture; starts from the northern end of Galata (the medieval Genoese quarter) at T\u00fcnel Square and ultimately leads up to Taksim Square. Galatasaray Square is located at approximately the center of the avenue and is home to the oldest secondary school in Turkey: the Galatasaray High School (Galatasaray Lisesi), originally known as the Galata Saray\u0131 Enderun-u H\u00fcmayunu (Galata Palace Imperial School). \u00c7i\u00e7ek Pasaj\u0131 (Flower Passage), also known by its French name Cit\u00e9 de P\u00e9ra, is one of the many historic buildings that adorn the avenue. In the historic Karak\u00f6y (Galata) district towards the southern end of the avenue, it is possible to see the world's second-oldest subway station, generally known and referred to as simply T\u00fcnel (The Tunnel) which entered service in 1875.

A view from \u0130stiklal Avenue During the Ottoman period, the avenue was called Cadde-i Kebir (Grand Avenue) in Turkish or Grande Rue de P\u00e9ra. It was a popular spot for Ottoman intellectuals, European and the local Italian and French Levantines. When 19th-century travelers referred to Constantinople (today, Istanbul) as the Paris of the East, they were mentioning the Grande Rue de P\u00e9ra (\u0130stiklal Caddesi) and its half-European, half-Asian culture. With the declaration of the Republic on 29 October 1923, the avenue's name was changed to \u0130stiklal (Independence) for commemorating the triumph at the Turkish War of Independence. In September 1955, during the anti-Greek Istanbul pogrom, the Avenue was pillaged in one night, while it was covered with pieces of glass, clothes, smashed white goods, rolled down and burned automobiles and other goods, all belonging to the wrecked shops.Binnaz Tugba Sasanlar.

However, during the late 1980s and early 1990s, a massive restoration process took place, which was master-planned and executed by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality and Beyo\u011flu Municipality (including the restoration of the historic buildings, new pavements for full pedestrianization, and the reinstallation of the historic trams), bringing the avenue its old charm and popularity. \u0130stiklal Avenue once again became the center of fine arts and leisure in Istanbul, with real estate prices skyrocketing as a result. Numerous new art galleries, bookstores, caf\u00e9s, pubs, restaurants, shops and hotels were opened. The venues around the avenue became the host of many international art festivals, such as the annual Istanbul Film Festival. \u0130stiklal Avenue is also a popular venue for all sorts of parades (such as the annual Istanbul Pride), marches, gatherings and protests (such as the 2013 Gezi Park protests) in the city. On 19 March 2016 it was the location of a suicide bombing attack that killed 5 people. ==See also== * Abdi \u0130pek\u00e7i Avenue * Ba\u011fdat Avenue * List of upscale shopping districts ==References== ==External links== * istiklal caddesi / istiklal.caddesi.com * \u0130stiklalCaddesi.net - A news website of the Avenue Category:Streets in Istanbul Category:Shopping districts and streets in Turkey Category:Pedestrian streets in Turkey Category:Beyo\u011flu Category:Tourist attractions in Istanbul Category:Restaurant districts and streets in Turkey Category:Entertainment districts in Turkey ",
