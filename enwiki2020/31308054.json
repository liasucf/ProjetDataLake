    "text": "The International Literacy Foundation (ILF) is an independent, international nonprofit organisation, founded in 2010 with the aim of tackling illiteracy globally and therefore improving living standards around the world. == Overview == The organisation has a mandate of alleviating illiteracy throughout the world. The core belief of the organisation and its affiliates is that literacy is the 'quintessential cornerstone of education', key to reducing poverty and therefore raising living standards around the world. It maintains a dedicated focus on individual causes, with the potential to make a positive impact on underprivileged groups and their quality of life. The ILF seeks to meet these objectives through the administration of literacy-based projects, which is achieved through several methods: * Conducting presentations and seminars * The donation of educational material, such as books and computer technology * Developing and expanding library facilities === Mission statement === The mission of the ILF is based on its commitment to invest in initiatives encouraging and supporting literacy and education, with a primary focus on literacy, as well as making grants to other organisations supporting similar educational causes, including those in which members and volunteers are engaged. As the organisation has its roots in education, however, it has a firm belief in the power of volunteers to collaborate, creating human opportunity and exerting a positive impact on the quality of life of those who are less fortunate. Funding provided will therefore target selected initiatives and activities that promote education through literacy.
