    "text": "This is a list of men's collegiate wrestling programs in the United States that compete in NCAA Division I. For the 2019\u201320 NCAA Division I men's wrestling season, 79 schools in the United States sponsor Division I varsity men's wrestling. This list reflects each team's conference affiliation as of the 2020\u201321 season. ==Wrestling conferences== * The Big Ten Conference (Big Ten) is the only all-sport conference whose members (14) all compete in wrestling. * The six wrestling schools in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) are all currently full members of the conference. * The Mid-American Conference (MAC) has 10 affiliate members in addition to five full members after adding the seven members of the Eastern Wrestling League (EWL) as new affiliates starting in the 2019\u201320 season. * The Pac-12 Conference (Pac-12) has six wrestling members in 2019\u201320. It had operated with three full members plus two affiliates after the elimination of Boise State's program, but restored its wrestling membership to the six required for NCAA recognition by adding Little Rock as an associate member in 2019\u201320. However, full member Stanford will drop its wrestling program after the 2020\u201321 season. * The Southern Conference (SoCon) with three full members meets the membership requirement by having five associate members, with the newest associate, Presbyterian, being the most recent addition in 2019\u201320. * The Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association (EIWA) is a wrestling-only conference that had 16 members in the 2018\u201319 season, and added another member for 2019\u201320 and beyond. Six members are also full members of the Ivy League and compete for that conference's dual meet championship during the EIWA season. EIWA member Franklin & Marshall is the only Division III school competing in Division I wrestling. Joining for 2019\u201320 were the LIU Sharks, created by the merger of Long Island University's two athletic programs\u2014the Division I LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds, which did not sponsor wrestling, and the Division II LIU Post Pioneers, which did. The former LIU Post wrestling program has continued to compete as the LIU Sharks. * The Big 12 Conference (Big 12) had lost its NCAA recognition when wrestling membership fell to only four full member schools, despite the fact that three of those four schools had won a combined 49 NCAA Division I wrestling team titles. On July 29, 2015, the Big 12 announced that the members of the Western Wrestling Conference (which had six members, but was not recognized by the NCAA) had been accepted as affiliate members of the Big 12, increasing the number of participating schools to ten and restoring the conference's automatic bids. The Big 12 has since added two more wrestling affiliates, though one of these, namely Fresno State, will drop the sport after the 2020\u201321 season. ==Current Division I schools== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- valign=baseline ! style=\"width:250px;\"|School ! style=\"width:50px;\"|Location ! style=\"width:20px;\"|State ! style=\"width:50px;\"|Nickname ! style=\"width:50px;\"|Conference ! style=\"width:200px;\"|Primary conference ! style=\"width:200px;\" data-sort- type=\"number\"|National titles |- | American University | Washington | DC | Eagles | EIWA | Patriot League | 0 |- | Appalachian State University | Boone | NC | Mountaineers | SoCon | Sun Belt | 0 |- | Arizona State University | Tempe | AZ | Sun Devils | colspan=2|Pac-12 | 1 \u2013 1988 |- | Binghamton University | Vestal | NY | Bearcats | EIWA | America East | 0 |- | Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania | Bloomsburg | PA | Huskies | MAC | PSAC (Div.
