Launched towards geostationary orbit in 1969 it failed to achieve orbit. == Design == The first of eight Intelsat III satellites to be launched, Intelsat III F-5 was built by TRW. It was a spacecraft equipped with two transponders to be powered by body-mounted solar cells generating 183 watts of power. It had a design life of five years and carried an SVM-2 apogee motor for propulsion. == Launch == Intelsat III F-5 was launched on the maiden flight of the Delta M rocket, flying from Launch Complex 17A at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The launch took place on July 26, 1969, with the spacecraft bound for a geosynchronous transfer orbit. Due to a failure in the third phase of the launch process made the satellite not reach the desired orbit. ==See also== * 1969 in spaceflight ==References== Category:Intelsat satellites Category:Spacecraft launched in 1969 Category:1969 in spaceflight Category:Satellite launch failures ",
