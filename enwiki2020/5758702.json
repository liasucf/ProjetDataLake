The Mitsubishi Proudia (Japanese: \u4e09\u83f1\u30fb\u30d7\u30e9\u30a6\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2 Mitsubishi Puraudia) is a luxury car manufactured by Mitsubishi Motors, positioned just below the flagship Mitsubishi Dignity limousine in the company's range. Its name is a portmanteau derived from the English word \"proud\", and \"diamond\" (referring to the company's logo),\"Luxury sedan and limousine models\" , Mitsubishi Motors press release, December 20, 1999 In Japan, it was sold in 2012 as a large luxury sedan exclusive to Japanese buyers, and was reintroduced 2012 to Japan based on the Nissan Fuga. It was sold at a specific retail chain called Galant Shop. ==Series S32A (1999\u20132001)== Mitsubishi Proudia (Japan) The entire Proudia/Dignity range was designed by Mitsubishi Motors and co-manufactured with Hyundai of South Korea, who marketed their own version as the Hyundai Centennial/Hyundai Equus.\"Mitsubishi's new flagships\" , Jack Yamaguchi, Automotive Engineering International Online, March 2000 The Proudia was introduced as a competitor to the Nissan Cima and Toyota Celsior as a full size luxury car, however Mitsubishi chose to use a transversely installed engine with front wheel drive. Production was discontinued after only 1227 vehicles were produced during three years. The Proudia was priced from \u00a54.6 million to \u00a56.4 million, and came in three specifications labelled A, B or C. A and B featured a 6G74 3497 cc GDi V6 producing at 5500 rpm and of torque at 2500 rpm, while specification C featured the 8A80 4498 cc GDi V8 producing at 5000 rpm and at 4000 rpm. The car was equipped with several advanced features like CCD cameras to monitor adjacent lanes and behind the car, and a lidar activated adaptive cruise control. It used MacPherson struts for the front suspension and a multi-link suspension for the rear wheels. The Dignity and Proudia's combined volumes fell far shy of Mitsubishi's estimated 300 sales per month, and they were available for only fifteen months from their introduction on February 20, 2000, before Mitsubishi's financial difficulties forced the company to discontinue both models in an effort to streamline its range and reduce costs.\"Streamlining of production capacity and model portfolio\" , MMC press release, March 28, 2001 Sales of the Proudia in Japan were affected by the fact that it didn't comply with Japanese Government dimension and engine displacement regulations for \"compact\" sized cars and Japanese buyers were liable for additional taxes, and the economic fallout due to the collapse of the \"bubble economy\". The Proudia's engine displacement also made Japanese buyers liable for higher annual road tax. The Hyundai Equus proved more commercially successful and would remain in production until replaced in 2008.\"Future Vehicles Preview: 2008 Hyundai Equus Large Sedan\" , Inside Line, edmunds.com ===Production and sales=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center\" |- ! style=\"width:15em\" | Year ! style=\"width:25em\" | Production ! style=\"width:25em\" | Sales |- | 1999 | 383 | - |- | 2000 | 759 | 852 |- | 2001 | 85 | 97 (+1 export) |- |} (Sources: Fact & Figures 2000, Fact & Figures 2005, Mitsubishi Motors website) ==Series BY51 (2012\u20132016)== Mitsubishi Proudia Announced in early 2012, Mitsubishi Motors is cooperating with Nissan to sell their own version of the Nissan Fuga Y51 under the Proudia name after an 11-year hiatus, and sales of the Nissan Fuga-based Proudia started July 26, 2012, replacing the discontinued Mitsubishi Galant. A stretched wheelbase version is also sold as the Dignity. Compared to its predecessor, the height is slightly higher; however the length and width have been reduced, resulting in reduced weight. In addition, all models are now in compliance with Japanese Government 2005 emission standards, resulting in a 75% reduction level over the previous model. The Mitsubishi trim packages are aligned with their Nissan Fuga counterparts. The Proudia \u201c250 A\u201d is the equivalent Fuga \u201c 250 GT\u201d, the \u201cProudia 250 VIP\u201d to the \"Fuga 250 VIP\u201d, and the \u201cProudia 370 VIP\u201d to the \u201cFuga 370 VIP\u201d. The \u201cProudia 370 4WD\u201d is the equivalent to the \u201cFuga 370 GT Four\u201d, the first time the Proudia is offered with All-wheel-drive. The hybrid engine option offered on the Fuga is not offered on the Proudia, and is only available on the longer Dignity limousine. The term \"VIP\" reflects a high status car in Japan. The Proudia is cosmetically different from the Fuga, using a Mitsubishi specific grille and appearance items. Many of the items in the Fuga are also available in the Proudia, to include the pollen filter, Nissan\u2019s \u201cSafety Shield\u201d packages, such as intelligent cruise control, ECO pedal, intelligent brake assist, with optional items on Nissan-branded products also available on equivalent Proudia trim packages.
