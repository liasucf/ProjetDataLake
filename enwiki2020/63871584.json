    "text": "Misinchinka Ranges, is the largest subdivision range of the Hart Ranges, of the Northern Rockies in British Columbia, Canada. The boundaries of the Misinchinka Ranges generally lie between the Rocky Mountain Trench to the west, Clearwater Creek and the Sukunka River to the east, the Peace Arm of Williston Reservoir to the north and Monkman Provincial Park to the south. The Misinchinka Range contains 33 officially named mountain peaks, including one ultra-prominent peak, Mount Crysdale. Many peaks within the range are named for local Canadian soldiers killed in action during World War I and World War II. While there are no permanent settlements within the Misinchinka Ranges, the range is bordered by the communities of Mackenzie, Bear Lake, Tumbler Ridge and Prince George and lies within the traditional territories of the Treaty 8 First Nations; Blueberry River First Nation, Doig River First Nation, Halfway River First Nation, Mcleod Lake Indian Band, Saulteau First Nation and West Moberly First Nation. Two 6.0 kilometre electrified train tunnels were constructed by BC Rail through the Misinchinka Range in the early 1980s to connect the coal mines of Tumbler Ridge to the provincial rail network. The line ceased operations in 2000. The Coastal GasLink Pipeline project will pass through the Misinchinka Range between Mount Kinney and Alexis Peak. Construction began in 2019 and is expected to be in service in 2023. == Prominent Peaks == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+Official Mountains of the Misinchinka Range With At Least 500 Meters of Topographic Prominence !Ranking !Mountain Peak !Coordinates !Elevation !Prominence !Isolation !Nearest Higher Neighbour |- |1 |Sentinel Peak |54\u00b054\u203228\u2033N 121\u00b057\u203241\u2033W |2,513 m 8,245 ft |1,454 m 4,764 ft |86.5 km ESE |Weaver Peak |- |2 |Mount Vreeland |54\u00b034\u20328\u2033N 121\u00b025\u203258\u2033W |2,464 m 8,084 ft |1,275 m 4,183 ft |30.3 km SE |Mount Bulley |- |3 |Mount Crysdale |55\u00b056\u203218\u2033N 123\u00b025\u203215\u2033W |2,427 m 7,963 ft |1,548 m 5,079 ft |104.7 km N |Unnamed Peak |- |4 |Mount Selwyn |55\u00b059\u203230\u2033N 123\u00b036\u203224\u2033W |2,291 m 7,516 ft |950 m 3,117 ft |11.8 km ESE |Unnamed Peak |- |5 |Mount Dudzic |54\u00b056\u203221\u2033N 121\u00b052\u20324\u2033W |2,169 m 7,116 ft |746 m 2,448 ft |6.9 km WSW |Sentinel Peak |- |6 |Alexis Peak |55\u00b02\u203255\u2033N 122\u00b01\u203250\u2033W |2,123 m 6,965 ft |593 m 1,946 ft |14.3 km ESE |Unnamed Peak |- |7 |Mount Myhon |54\u00b047\u20325\u2033N 121\u00b031\u203225\u2033W |2,119 m 6,952 ft |659 m 2,162 ft |9.6 km SSE |Unnamed Peak |- |8 |Gable Mountain |54\u00b030\u20321\u2033N 121\u00b040\u203227\u2033W |2,095 m 2,182 ft |665 m 2,182 ft |12.5 km ENE |Unnamed Peak |- |9 |Mount Abbl |54\u00b041\u20321\u2033N 121\u00b042\u203232\u2033W |2,012 m 6,601 ft |646 m 2,343 ft |12.0 km E |Unnamed Peak |- |10 |Mount Kinney |55\u00b05\u203258\u2033N 122\u00b010\u203225\u2033W |1,996 m 6,549 ft |714 m 2,343 ft |8.0 km ESE |Unnamed Peak |- |11 |Mount Whitford |54\u00b052\u20323\u2033N 121\u00b052\u203218\u2033W |1,987 m 6,519 ft |583 m 1,913 ft |6.5 km W |Unnamed Peak |- |12 |Mount Bracey |54\u00b054\u203217\u2033N 122\u00b06\u203220\u2033W |1,954 m 5,411 ft |597 m 1,959 ft |7.7 km ENE |Unnamed Peak |- |13 |Mount Aiken |55\u00b01\u20326\u2033N 122\u00b022\u203231\u2033W |1,854 m 6,083 ft |673 m 2,208 ft |15.7 km ENE |Mount Kinney |- |14 |Old Friend Mountain |55\u00b015\u20322\u2033N 122\u00b036\u203254\u2033W |1,844 m 6,050 ft |588 m 1,929 ft |13.0 km E |Mount Hunter |- |15 |Mount Morfee |55\u00b025\u203249\u2033N 123\u00b02\u20323\u2033W |1,775 m 5,823 ft |521 m 1,709 ft |22.1 km E |Mount Murray |- |16 |Lavitah Mountain |55\u00b013\u203232\u2033N 122\u00b046\u203246\u2033W |1,699 m 5,574 ft |545 m 1,788 ft |10.8 km E |Old Friend Mountain |} == Other Mountains == Other official mountain peaks under 500 m of prominence include: Mount Irwin, Azu Mountain, Uguznasechi Mountain, Thabah Mountain, Mount Garbitt, Mount Crocker, Mount Barton, Mount Wendt, Mount McPhee, Patches Mountain, Mount West, Dathseykaly Mountain, Tsahunga Mountain, Mount Thomas, Burden Peak, Mount Emmet, Powder King Peak. == References == Category:Geography of British Columbia Category:Northern Interior of British Columbia Category:Mountain ranges of British Columbia ",
