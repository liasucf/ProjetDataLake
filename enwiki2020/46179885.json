(2016). Policing and Social Media: Social Control in an Era of New Media.\" Lanham, MD: Lexington Books | Rowman & Littlefield His book Policing and Social Media: Social Control in an Era of New Media illustrates the process by which new information technology\u2014namely, social media\u2014and related changes in communication formats have affected the public face of policing and police work in Canada.

Retrieved July 8, 2016. According to a review in the academic journal Symbolic Interaction, \"Policing and Social Media is essential reading for scholars of media and crime.\" A review in the Police Journal: Theory, Practice and Principles said \"This book is timely and of major importance given the increasingly central role social media now occupies in global policing, governance and accountability discourses. Alexandre Turgeon writes in the American Review of Canadian Studies: \"In light of the many high-profile and recent police shootings in the United States, and the way that they were framed on YouTube and other social media sites, this book is a significant contribution on the field of policing and information\". The book has also been profiled extensively in news media.Public education and outreach efforts earn BU professor national award, Brandon University, November 13, 2017 A review in Canadian news magazine Maclean's called Policing and Social Media \"surprisingly populist\". Community activist and freelance writer Tom SandbornSandborn, T.. (2015). The 5-Minute Freelancer Q&A; #20 - Tom Sandborn. Posted on April 22, 2015. (in a review he wrote published in the Vancouver Sun), called the book \"important\" continuing \"Schneider has done a fine job with this study, and anyone in Canada who cares about policing, privacy, civil liberties and personal freedom should read it\". Sandborn, however also lamented that Schneider\u2019s \u201cprose style is unfortunately a bit fusty and mannered, as is so often true of those who write from a faculty office.\u201d Likewise, Maclean\u2019s described the book as \u201cdense with academic terminology\u201d. Tom Sandborn suggests that Schneider misses the mark because \u201che unfortunately pays more attention to how Canadian police forces use various net platforms to communicate with the public than to how those same cyber entities can be tapped by government spies to illicitly harvest information about Canadians\u201d. While some reviews were positive, others noted some weaknesses with Schneider\u2019s approach. Christopher D. O\u2019Conner noted a \u201csubstantial critique of the book is that Schneider\u2019s analysis is limited to texts. At times, the author makes claims regarding police intent without conducting interviews with officers about their own social media use. While text analysis is a completely valid methodological approach, interviewing officers would have provided a more well-rounded picture of the impact social media is having on policing.\u201d https://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/3365/3521 Likewise, Sarah Lageson sounds a note of caution about the book: \u201cBecause Schneider relies heavily on qualitative media analysis, readers might sense they are receiving a second-order interpretation of what happened. We don\u2019t get direct ethnographic insight into the internal processes of police departments as they grapple with using social media in their own PR and investigatory work.\u201d Lageson, Sarah (2017) \u201cReview of Policing and Social Media: Social Control in an Era of New Media\u201c Contemporary Sociology: v47 n2: 217-219.
