After her 1991 PhD thesis, titled 'Long-term creep modeling of wood using time temperature superposition principle' , she moved to Lincoln University, rising to full professor. Much of Samarasinghe's work involves software modelling of complex biological systems. == Selected works == * Samarasinghe, Sandhya.
