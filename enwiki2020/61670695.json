    "text": "Hercules is a musical based on the Walt Disney Animation Studios 1997 film of the same name. The music and lyrics were written by Alan Menken and David Zippel with a book by Kristoffer Diaz. The production is also loosely based on the legendary hero of the same name, the son of Zeus, in Greek mythology. Produced by Disney Theatrical Productions, the musical had a tryout at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park in August 2019 and was met with a mixed to positive critical response. == Development == In July 2017, Alan Menken announced that he is working on a stage adaptation of the 1997 film, Hercules. On February 6, 2019, it was announced that the theatrical adaptation would premiere later that year. == Production == === Manhattan (2019) === The world premiere occurred at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, Manhattan, New York, as part of its Public Works program from August 31 until September 8. Menken and David Zippel returned to compose and write the songs, while Kristoffer Diaz wrote the book, Lear deBessonet directed and Chase Brock choreographed. The cast included Jelani Alladin (Hercules), Roger Bart (Hades), Jeff Hiller (Panic), Nelson Chimilio (Pain), James Monroe Iglehart (Phil), Ramona Keller (Thalia), Tamika Lawrence (Calliope), Krysta Rodriguez (Meg), and Rema Webb (Terpsichore). Menken wrote new songs for the musical, as well as reusing the film's original works. === Future === On March 22, 2020, Alan Menken appeared on Rosie O'Donnell's livestream benefit for the Actors Fund, where he talked about his upcoming projects, saying \"I'm working on Disenchanted, the sequel to Enchanted, and I have another Broadway show\" and in a separate thought, he added \"Hercules is coming to the stage. Of course we did that in Central Park last summer.\" Disney Theatricals subsequently confirmed that they intend to make the product available for licensing. In May 16, 2020, it was reported that Robert Horn will write a new iteration for the musical, with Lear deBessonet returning as director. In August 18, 2020, Menken confirmed that the musical is indeed being adapted to Broadway. == Musical numbers == The music was composed by Alan Menken, with lyrics by David Zippel.

Thom Geier, of TheWrap, praised the production, saying it \"works better than bigger- budgeted recent efforts like Frozen\". Jessica Derschowits, of Entertainment Weekly, welcomed the \"lively but low-key production that feels in many ways like the polar opposite of Disney's string of megawatt Broadway hits \u2014 which is a big part of its charm\". Jesse Green, of The New York Times, gave a positive review by commenting on the \"shrewd casting and amateur performers joining professionals onstage, a middling 1997 animated Disney musical becomes a pageant of civic engagement\". Matt Windman, of AM New York Metro, gave a mixed review by commenting on \"the lighthearted tone of the film, Kristoffer Diaz's new book features countless zingers and inside jokes. Diaz also tries to deliver an underlying moral on the difference between being a hero and a celebrity. However, Diaz may have gone too far in changing around some of the original sequencing, which has made the second half of the show very messy\". == References == Category:2019 musicals Category:Broadway musicals Category:Greco-Roman mythology in popular culture Category:Heracles in fiction Category:Hercules (franchise) Category:Musicals based on animated films Category:Musicals by Alan Menken Category:Musicals by David Zippel Category:Plays set in ancient Greece Category:Walt Disney Theatrical ",
