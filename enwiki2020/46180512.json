His first art lessons were at the \"\u0218coala Na\u021bional\u0103 de Arte Frumoase\" (now the Bucharest National University of Arts) in Bucharest under Theodor Aman. He also studied basic medicine with Dr.Carol Davila. On the doctor's urging, he participated in the Russo-Turkish War (known as the \"War of Independence\" in Romania), and was attached to army headquarters where he was commissioned to paint military campaign scenes and related subjects.Picturi create de George Demetrescu Mirea, \u00een colectiile Muzeului de Art\u0103 Constan\u021ba from Cultura, October 2007, @ Telegraf With the patronage of Ion Ghica, and a recommendation from Nicolae Grigorescu, he was awarded a scholarship to study at the \"\u00c9cole des Beaux Arts\" in Paris. His primary instructor was Carolus-Duran and he remained there until 1884. That same year, he was commissioned to provide murals for the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in Constan\u021ba, which he executed in conjunction with the architect Ion Mincu. They were, however, destroyed during World War II. From 1887 to 1888, he decorated the \"Casa Vernescu\" (built in 1820; named after its second owner, George Vernescu, a government Minister); again working with Mincu, who was doing renovations there. Today, the building is a casino and restaurant. The following year, he became a teacher at the Normal School in C\u00e2mpulung. In 1891, he was appointed a Professor at his old alma mater, the \"\u0218coala Na\u021bional\u0103\". Eight years later, he became Director, a position he held until 1927. He also painted murals at the National Bank of Romania and Alexandru Ioan Cuza University. A street near the Arcul de Triumf is named after him. ==Selected paintings== File:George Demetrescu Mirea - Profil de femeie.jpg|Female Profile File:George Demetrescu Mirea - Nicolae Petra\u015fcu in Hidalgo.jpg|Nicolae Petra\u015fcu as a \"Hidalgo\" File:George Demetrescu Mirea - Fetita cu pisici.jpg|Little Girl with Cats File:George Demetrescu Mirea - Sotia pictorului.jpg|Portrait of his wife in 18th-Century Costume File:George Demetrescu Mirea - Copil asezat.jpg|A Baby, Sitting ==References== ==Further reading== *George Dragomirescu and Ion Frunzetti, G.
