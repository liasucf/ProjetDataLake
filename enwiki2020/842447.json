    "text": "Theodore Austin-Sparks (1888\u20131971), often known as \"Mr. Sparks\" or \"TAS\", was a British Christian evangelist and author. ==Early life== After his birth in London in 1888, Theodore was sent at a young age to live in Scotland with his father's relatives. There, at the age of 17, he determined to become a Christian as he listened to a group of young street-preachers in Glasgow. Within a short time, he was also giving his public testimony alongside this group.http://www.austin-sparks.net/english/000534.html An Appreciation of T. Austin-Sparks by Harry Foster ==Career== Mr Austin-Sparks was ordained as a Baptist minister at the age of 24. From 1912 to 1926, he led three congregations in Greater London. During 1923-26, he spoke at conferences with Jessie Penn-Lewis and was associated with her publication and speaking ministry, The Overcomer Testimony. In 1926, Austin-Sparks broke with this organization. http://www.austin-sparks.net/pdf/searchable/AWAT1927.pdf See page 100: A Further Word Following a spiritual crisis in 1926,http://www.austin-sparks.net/english/books/004495.html Letter by T. Austin-Sparks Mr Austin-Sparks resigned his Baptist ordination. Later that year the congregation at Honor Oak all agreed to leave the Baptist denomination (see Church Notes in the 1926 A Witness and A Testimony magazines).http://www.austin-sparks.net/pdf/searchable/AWAT1926.pdf A Witness and A Testimony magazine, 1926. Together with like-minded Christians, he established a conference and training center at Honor Oak in southeast London. A great number of Christians participated in conferences and classes at the center while staying at available guest quarters, some living there for years at a time participating in Bible courses, practical services, and church meetings. There was a similar conference center maintained during the summers at Heathfield House in Kilcreggan, Scotland which was owned by Honor Oak Christian Fellowship. A Trust was set up for the house in 1931. https://www.austin-sparks.net/english/005273.html In 1960 Kilcreggan was gifted to the interdenominational faith mission, WEC International. \"My Dear C.U.M.B.: Norman Grubb's Letters To The Cambridge University Missionary Band 1922-1989\", see pages 127-128 From the Honor Oak Christian Fellowship Centre Mr Austin-Sparks and his co-workers ran a publishing operation that printed a bi-monthly magazine, A Witness and a Testimony.http://www.austin- sparks.net/magazines_chrono.html A Witness and A Testimony magazines online This magazine was printed from 1923 until Austin-Sparks' death in 1971.

Mr Austin-Sparks believed that what was from God and of God would be taken care of by Him, he wrote: \"God only takes responsibility to supply and to carry on that which is essentially heavenly, and in the measure in which a thing is heavenly, and only in that measure (but surely in that measure), God takes responsibility for it\".https://www.austin-sparks.net/about.html He and his wife Florence, had 4 daughters and 1 son.
