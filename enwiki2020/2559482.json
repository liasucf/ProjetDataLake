Stacey Jones is the first and only life member of the New Zealand Warriors club whose records for most appearances, tries and points he held at the time of his retirement. Jones' vision and ability to control the game when his team was on attack earned him the sobriquet \"the little general\", a reference also to his small stature in comparison to that of most rugby league players. Jones was often able to find players with a high bombing kick at either sides of the field or place a sneaky through ball for oncoming players to pounce on. ==Early years== Of M\u0101ori descent,http://www.maoritelevision.com/news/galleries/2014-maori-sports- awards-results Stacey Jones was born in Auckland, New Zealand on 7 May 1976, a grandchild to New Zealand rugby league great Maunga Emery.Coffey and Wood The Kiwis: 100 Years of International Rugby League He played junior grades for the Ponsonby Ponies and Mt Albert Lions before moving to the City-Pt Chev Pirates when he was 9.

On 23 April 1995 Jones made his first- grade d\u00e9but in Sydney, coming off bench to score a try in the Warriors' 40\u20134 win over the Parramatta Eels. The Warriors' halfback Greg Alexander missed Rounds 10 and 11 through injury which resulted in Jones taking over at halfback. Jones played well enough to retain the position and force Alexander to move to fullback upon his return. He also quickly established his place in the international scene, replacing Gary Freeman as the New Zealand national rugby league team halfback during the 1995 World Cup. Over the next several years Jones cemented his spot in both the Warriors and Kiwis, sticking with the Warriors despite the lack of success on and off the field. Between 1995 and 1999 he played over 100 consecutive first grade games for the Warriors.

It was under the new management where he first became club captain \u2013 in 2001 co-captaining with Kevin Campion \u2013 and although already considered in the top reaches of halfbacks in the NRL, he started to show he was on an equal par with the games' best halfbacks at the time. In the 3-year period 2001-03 he led the Warriors to 3 successive finals appearances. In 2002 the club not only won the Minor Premiership, but also reached the 2002 NRL grand final against the Sydney Roosters. Playing at scrum half back, Jones captained the losing side that evening but scored a great try in which he beat 3 Roosters defenders from 30 metres out to go over from dummy half. He was then selected to go on the 2002 New Zealand rugby league tour of Great Britain and France and won the George Smith Medal as player of the series against Great Britain. Also in 2002, Jones became only the second New Zealand player to win the Golden Boot Award for the best international rugby league player. thumb In his career, he has also represented New Zealand at two World Cups (1995 and 2000), three Tri Nations series (1999, 2005, 2006), and has played 41 games for the New Zealand Kiwis.
