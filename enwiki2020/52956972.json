    "text": "A Nissan Leaf electric car in Hong Kong. The adoption of electric vehicles in Hong Kong is actively supported by the HK government, which recognizes battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids, and conventional hybrid electric vehicles to be environmentally friendly and eligible for financial incentives. As of 31 October 2017, there were 11,039 electric vehicles in Hong Kong, up from less than 100 in 2010. At present, 73 EV models from eight countries have been approved by the Transport Department to be eligible for the incentives. These include 51 models for private cars and motorcycles and 22 models for public transport and commercial vehicles. ==Current electric vehicle policy== In March 1994, the government waived the First Registration Tax for EVs. The tax was extended several times, and the most recent extension lasted until March 2017. However, EVs are yet to be popular in Hong Kong. Since the 2009\u201310 Policy Address, a series of schemes and policies have been implemented by the government to actively promote and encourage the use of EVs. In order to coordinate the work in promoting EVs, the Steering Committee on the Promotion of Electric Vehicles was established in April 2012. The committee is chaired by the Financial Secretary with two-year terms, along with 16 other members who represent government departments and the private sector.Legislative Council. (2012). Information note on the use of electric vehicles. The government's aim is to have zero emission buses running across the territory. The government allocated $180 million to purchase 36 single-deck electric buses, which includes 28 battery-electric buses and 8 super-capacitor buses. 18 battery-electric buses and 2 super-capacitor buses have commenced operation. Most of the remaining electric buses were expected to be put into service progressively in late 2017 or early 2018. ==Reasons for the promotion of electric vehicles== === Environmental aspect === In 2014, the Hong Kong Emission Inventory Report indicated that the road transport sector was the largest local air pollution source; 60% of carbon monoxide emissions came from transportation. The replacement of gasoline with electricity in EVs improves the air quality in cities, since carbon emissions are reduced. Along with minimising various pollution problems and lowering the risk of respiratory illnesses, noises and vibrations are also eliminated since EVs do not use chemical combustions.Rinkesh.

With technological advancements, EVs have a higher battery capacity that allows 100 km of traveling distance after a single charge, far higher than the original 40 km in early development. By comparing EVs with petrol vehicles over the energy cost, the price of the latter is around 13.6 times higher in the case from Tuen Mun to Mong Kok (30 km; HKD4.7:HKD36.7).Walden, V. (2016).

Retrieved November 6, 2016 Over 1,300 public chargers are spread throughout all 18 local districts, whereas one public charger is available for use by four EVs on average. 921 chargers are standard, 239 are medium, 15 are CHAdeMO quick chargers and 145 are quick chargers with transferable charging standards. The chargers can fully charge an EV within 30 minutes, compared to 8 hours previously. The government and other stakeholders are determined to enhance the charging efficiency of these public charging infrastructures through various ongoing infrastructure-led collaborations. For example, Charge Hong Kong, a non-profit organisation, is working to increase charging facilities in public areas and upgrade the existing public standard chargers to the medium or multi-standard quick type. Under the Pilot Green Transport Fund, 92 EVs were included for trial under a total subsidy of around $96 million in total.For discussion on 21 July 2015 Legislative Council Panel On Environmental Affairs progress report on the pilot green transport fund.

These reflected that EVs are compatible with local operating conditions with huge green innovative development potentials in the future. == Promotion == The government is committed to promoting the use of EVs within different sectors of society. A number of favourable measures have been adopted to boost the use of EVs. === Economic incentives === Economic incentives have lowered the overall cost of EVs and encouraged their use. An exemption of the first registration tax on EVs was introduced in 1997 to promote the use of greener vehicles.Kwan, W. S. (2011). Analysing the potential of electric vehicles in improving the air quality of Hong Kong. HKU Theses Online (HKUTO).

Budget Speech. Hong Kong Financial Secretary\u2019s Office. Moreover, enterprises purchasing EVs will enjoy another tax deduction, which is a full \u201cprofits tax reduction for the capital expenditure on the EVs in the first year of procurement\u201d. === Financial support === To encourage the public transport sector to use EVs, the government offered the industry some financial assistance programs, such as the \u201cPilot Green Transport Fund\u201d.Please refer to the above section Development Progress of Electric Vehicles(See the above section.) The fund targets public transport service providers and attracts them to use innovative and green technologies for trial. Other financial assistance have been put in place, such as the one-off grant to PLB owners and the allocation of $180 million HKD for franchised bus runners to purchase electric buses. The former aims to upgrade PLB emission standard to that of EV, while the latter serves to test the use of EVs and promote the use of EVs. === Infrastructure and technical support === The government has dedicated itself to increasing the number of charging sockets,CLP. (2012). CLP Extends Free Vehicle Charging through 2013. as well as to collaborating with EV manufacturing firms to develop more advanced charging facilities. Apart from infrastructure support, the government has also issued a set of guidelines on the safe use of EV chargers and provides hotline service for information and technical support.Electrical and Mechanical Services Department. (2015). Technical Guidelines on Charging Facilities for Electric Vehicles. === Promotional activity === In an effort to promote the use of EVs in Hong Kong, the government provides a range of support, ranging from introducing preferential policies to holding promotional activities. The government prioritizes replacing government vehicles with EVs. In 2013, it was estimated that over 200 government vehicles were EVs.Press Releases. (27 November 2013). LCQ 14: Electric Vehicles.

There were nearly 500 public chargers in Hong Kong Island, whereas fewer than 400 in New Territories and Island Districts, which cover the most area of Hong Kong (see Diagram 1 below). Therefore, the insufficiency of chargers in rural areas is a great concern to some EV drivers.Bauhinia Foundation Research Centre.

Some drivers opined that it is not ideal to rely on public chargers, in particular when one could hardly find a parking space in Hong Kong.Ng, N. (2016, October 20). Electric cars on the rise in Hong Kong but building management are failing to plug a home-charging gap. SCMP.

The installation of chargers in private buildings has to undergo an array of procedures. According to the guidelines from the government, individual owners of EVs have to consult the owner of the car park space, the dealer of the EV, the property management company and the registered electrical contractor.\u88dd\u96fb\u52d5\u8eca\u5145\u96fb\u8a2d\u65bd \u90b1\u9a30\u83ef\u7c72\u6cd5\u5718\u914d\u5408 - \u9999\u6e2f\u6587\u532f\u5831 (2011, November 24).

By launching EV test-bed and forming agreement with Chinese companies to introduce EV into their public transportation, the determination of the government to utilize EVs as environmental policy to combat air pollution is clearly shown. However, surprisingly, as opposed to Hong Kong, the most popular EV model in Singapore is not Tesla. One may suggest the biggest obstacles come from the international oil company, which considers Singapore as the hub of oil refinement and trading center, hence acting as the tripping stone for the government to continuously promote the use of EVs.Tam, Eddie.

The program included a range of incentives, government support, legislation and education programs, suggesting that by 2020 all new cars sold in the UK should be either hybrid or electric. Apart from large-scale subsidies and tax reductions to incentivize the purchase of EVs, the government launched \u201cPlugged-in-Places\u201d to increase vehicle recharging points and convenience, as well as a 100% discount for the London Congestion Charge. The British government's comprehensive strategy resulted in a more than 20-fold increase of EVs being registered in the UK from 2011 to 2015.Yu, K.
