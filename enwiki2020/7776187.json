    "text": "The Silcis (sometimes spelled \"Sil'is\" or \"Seles\" in historical texts) are a Somali subclan. They are part of the Gorgate subclan of the Hawiye clan,Puccioni 1937, 37, Luling 1971, 30, and Cassanelli 1973, 30 which is one of the major clans of Somali people. The Silcis inhabit the traditional coastal region of Benadir in the southern part of Somalia. This region should not be confused with the much smaller present day Banaadir administrative region (gobol) which contains Somalia\u2019s capital Mogadishu. Silcis live, or have historically lived, along the Shabeelle River in towns such as Afgooye and Jowhaar, as well as along the coast, especially in Mogadishu and Warsheekh. ==Emergence and early history== The Silcis rose to prominence in the Shabeelle River region following the disintegration of the Ajuuraan Sultanate, which controlled a large part of southern Somalia, and with which the Silcis are connected.Luling 1990, 111 Cassanelli points out that in Geledi oral history accounts, the Silcis are often viewed as \"that section of the Ajuran who governed the Afgoy district\".Cassanelli 1973, 38 He asserts that Geledi accounts \"attest to the continuity and similarity of Ajuran and Sil'is rule\". The Silcis centre of power was in Lama Jiidle (present day Afgooye).Luling 1971, 30 Lama Jiidle means \"two roads\" in Somali. Barile erroneously claims that Afgooye's previous name was simply \"Seles\" (the common Italian spelling of Silcis).Barile 1935, 109 The Silcis imposed taxation on their subject clans, such as the Wacdaan, a fellow subclan of the Gurgate Hawiye, and the Geledi, a Rahanweyn subclan.Cassanelli 1982, 111 According to Virginia Luling, \"The Sil'is imposed their dominion on the Geledi, who had to pay as tribute a measure (suus) of grain every day from each household; it was collected and loaded on a camel, others say a donkey. A tax was also imposed on those who brought their stock to water at the river\u201d.Luling 1971, 30\u201331 Barile also describes the taxes levied by the Silcis.Barile 1935, 79-80 A controversial aspect of traditional Geledi and Wacdaan accounts of Silcis rule is the imposition by the Silcis sultan of ius primae noctis.Cassanelli 1973, 38 According to Eno, \"it was \u2018Xeer\u2019 [customary] for every Geledi bride... to celebrate her honeymoon [first] with a Silcis-Gorgaate male before she could celebrate the occasion with her official marital husband\".Eno 2005, 108 Luling, however, points out that ius primae noctis was \"A habit regularly attributed to tyrants in this part of Somalia\u201d.Luling 1971, 36 It is thus possible that the accounts of the Silcis practice were exaggerated by the clans they ruled. It is not known to what extent the Silcis sultans engaged in this practice. However, the importance of this account to Geledi and Wacdaan history should not be discounted or dismissed. ==Overthrow of Silcis== The final ruler of the Silcis in Lama Jiidle (Afgooye) was the sultan 'Umur Abukar Abroone.Luling 1971, 31 According to Luling, \"His daughter Imbia used to go round collecting the daily tribute of grain, accompanied by her slaves\" Luling 1971, 31 from her father's Wacdaan and Geledi subjects. Oral accounts hold that one day, \"when the Sultan's daughter came round to collect the tribute, she got a beating instead of the grain\", as the Geledi refused to pay.Luling 1971, 31 When Imbia reported this event to her father, he exclaimed \"waa la i afgooye\", literally \"they have cut off my mouth\", meaning that the regime's source of provision had been terminated. Lama Jiidle's name became Afgooye to commemorate this victory over the Silcis. According to Cassanelli, \u201cthe Geledi (Rahanweyn) and Wa'dan (Darandolle Gurgate) allied to drive the Sil'is from Afgoy\u201d.Cassanelli 1973, 41 The Silcis Sultanate in the Afgooye region was replaced by the Geledi Sultanate.Cassanelli 1973, 56 ==Later history== Some authors claim that the Silcis ceased to be a significant group after their overthrow in Afgooye. Puccioni states that \"the Silcis were reduced to a small, sparse grouping along the Shabeelle from Afgooye to Bulo Mererta [\u201ci Seles sono ridotti a piccoli raggruppamenti sparsi lungo lo Scebeli da Afgoi a Bulo Mererta\u201d].Puccioni 1937, 39 Luling claims that the Silcis \"became an insignificant, scattered people\u201d.Luling 1971, 32 It is apparent, however, from the historical record beginning in the 19th century that the Silcis became established at Warsheekh and that this became their new centre. The Italian colonial administration signed a \"TREATY of Peace, Friendship and Protection\" with the \"Chiefs of Warsheekh (Seles Gorgate and Abgal)\" on August 26, 1894.Haji 2001, 73 The Italians also confirmed Haji Mao Mallim Elmi, a Silcis member, as the chief of Warsheekh in 1897.Haji 2001, 75 In 1951, a large number of representatives of the Silcis submitted an appeal to the United Nations Advisory Council for the Trust Territory of Somaliland under Italian Administration, in order to protest the taking of Silcis lands by Italians. The signatories submitted the appeal \u201con behalf of the Seles Gorgate inhabitants living in Warsheikh, Giohar, Harar, Jigjiga, Mogadishu and Afgoi\".Haji 2001, 150\u2013151 ==Notes== ==References== *Barile, Pietro.
