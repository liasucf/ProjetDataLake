    "text": "Kasriel Broydo (1907\u20131945) was a songwriter, singer and coupletist. He was born in Vilnius and played in various troupes and marionette-theaters. His lyrics and songs, like (The sun has spread around), were the folk songs of his place and time. After the first World War Broydo moved to France and continued to work in theater. When Germany invaded Poland, he returned to Vilna. He was an integral and cherished participant, as writer, director and actor, to almost all the revi-theater programs in the Vilna ghetto theaters. An example of his inspirational skill was (Toward a better tomorrow), a 1943 song of hope which he wrote when it seemed the Soviet forces might prevail against the Germans. His last program in the Vilna ghetto, called (Hold on, Moyshe!), was almost ready for performance when, during the liquidation of the ghetto in September 1943, Broydo was seized by the Gestapo.Music and the Holocaust He was taken to Estonia, where he and his friends, Sime and Marek Shapiro, although interred, created performances for their fellow inmates in the labor camp. It was at this time that Broydo became religious.Zalmen Zylbercweig, , Book five, 4367-4370 Broydo's song (It's always dark for us), music by Henech Kon, written on a motif by Moshe Broderzon, was taken into Sh.
