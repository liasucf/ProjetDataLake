In 1892, the government of General Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reina Barrios promoted her to the post of Inspector General of Girls' Schools in Guatemala City. She wrote a book dedicated to Christopher Columbus in honor of that year's fourth centenary of his landing. Her teaching career was put on hold when she married Pr\u00f3spero Morales, in 1894, but after his death in 1898, she started teaching again. ==Biography == G\u00f3rriz de Morales graduated from Instituto Bel\u00e9n in 1884 with a teacher diploma, and the next year she also obtained a high school diploma. Shortly after graduating she became principal of the only complementary school that existed in Guatemala City at the time under then Secretary of Public Instruction, Antonio Batres J\u00e1uregui and eventually moved to the Instituto Bel\u00e9n faculty where she taught Pedagogy and Grammar with a method that she invented and that kept her students interested in the class and allowed them to reach a professional level even before graduating as teachers. G\u00f3rriz lobbied for and eventually got that the government of general Manuel Lisandro Barillas Berci\u00e1n on 28 June 1888 decreed the creation of the Escuela Normal de Se\u00f1oritas (Normal School for girls) which began started working in the old instituto Bel\u00e9n. In 1891 was named school principal and in 1892 was promoted to General Inspector of Elementary Public Instruction in Guatemala City. She was also president of the Guatemalan Teachers Central Academy and a member of the Madrid Geographic Society. In 1894, she married then Secretary of Infrastructure and War, Pr\u00f3spero Morales and left her career to focus on her family. === Pr\u00f3spero Morales resignation === Pr\u00f3spero Morales, Natalia G\u00f3rriz husband. But her marriage with Morales was soon going to undergo serious difficulties; in January 1897, some rebellions started against Reina Barrios; after a mild battle, a group of invaders were defeated and their leaders were taken prisoners, judged and summarily executed on the same day. The opposition press was also critical of the president, accusing him of tyranny given that he had not allowed opposition political parties to prosper. On 5 March 1897, her husband Pr\u00f3spero Morales resigned as Secretary of Public Instruction in order to participate as a presidential candidate in the upcoming elections. . Opposition newspaper La Rep\u00fablica editors accused the government -and particularly Pr\u00f3spero Morales, former Secretary of Infrastructure, and president Reina Barrios- of wasting the few resources the country had trying to do all their projects at once: besides the Northern Railroad -which in case of had been the only project built would have brought considerable benefits to the country- boulevards, parks, squares, public buildings, and luxurious office buildings had been built as well, not to mention the three millions pesos wasted on the failed Exposici\u00f3n Centroamericana. On 31 May 1897 the president dissolved the National Assembly and by August the situation was critical. Pr\u00f3spero Morales moved with G\u00f3rriz and his family to San Marcos and joined the revolutions that rose against Reina Barrios in Quetzaltenango. === Pr\u00f3spero Morales death === After the September Quetzaltenango Revolution of 1897 failed, Morales and G\u00f3rriz fled Guatemala and moved into Tapachula, M\u00e9xico where he learned that former Secretary of the Interior Manuel Estrada Cabrera had been appointed as interim president after Reina Barrios was murdered on 8 February 1898, Pr\u00f3spero Morales made the decision to be a presidential candidate in the 1898 elections. However, when he realized that Estrada Cabrera was using his position to ridge the elections, Morales went to M\u00e9xico City to recruit people for an invasion to Guatemala. Back in Tapachula we received support from colonels Rodrigo Castilla and V\u00edctor L\u00f3pez, who lived on the Guatemalan side of the border, in San Marcos -where Morales was born-. On 22 July 1898, approximately 1500 rebels entered Guatemala from Mexico equipped with Mauser rifles to end Estrada Cabrera regime, but their adventure was swiftly neutralized, as Estrada Cabrera sent twelve thousand troops to stop them, declared Martial Law and secured the help of a British navy ship to attack the Port of Oc\u00f3s if needed. The commander in chief of the Guatemalan Army was former president Manuel Lisandro Barillas Berci\u00e1n, who defeated the rebels in Vado Ancho on 5 August of that year. After the invasion failure Morales followers split; some of them went back to Mexico while a few stayed with him, until he surrendered on 14 August. He eventually died on 17 August. === Restarting her teaching career === After the death of her husband, she published her book Compedio de geograf\u00eda descriptiva (Descriptive Geography handbook) in 1904 and then was named director of the International School for Girls, where the Guatemalan elite sent their daughters to get an education. In 1922, the Pan American Feminist Congress took place in Baltimore in the United States and twenty Latin American congress sent their delegates; in the Congress it was evident the enormous inequality between the American delegates their Latin American counterparts, as well as the preeminence of the Americans on all the topics and the negative attitude some of them had over Latin America. After noticing this, Mexican writer and philanthropist Elena Arizmendi, who attended the Congress as observer, announced the formation of a Spanish and Hispanic American Women League -or Women of the Race League- which started in 1923; in Guatemala, professor G\u00f3rriz de Morales was the League delegate. When specialized Kindergarten teaching formally began in Guatemala on 28 June 1928, professor G\u00f3rriz de Morales was among the first batch of instructors who served pro bono. == Notes and references == === References === === Bibliography === * * * * * * * * * * * === Works by G\u00f3rriz de Morales === * * * Category:1868 births Category:Year of death missing Category:Guatemalan women writers Category:Guatemalan educators Category:People from Chimaltenango Department ",
