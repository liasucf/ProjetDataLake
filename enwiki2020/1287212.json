    "text": "West Virginia's folk heritage is a part of the Appalachian folk music tradition, and includes styles of fiddling, ballad singing, and other styles that draw on Ulster-Scots music. West Virginia consists of a mostly rural region, although its few relatively urban centers are prominent spots of musical innovation. The Capitol Music Hall, in Wheeling, is the oldest performing place of its kind in the state, and has hosted a wide variety of acts, from national tours to the local Wheeling Symphony Orchestra. Other music institutions in West Virginia include the Mountaineer Opera House in Milton. The West Virginia Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1939, as the Charleston Civic Orchestra, before becoming the Charleston Symphony Orchestra in 1943. The first conductor was William R. Wiant, followed by the prominent conductor Antonio Modarelli, of the Wheeling Symphony Orchestra. The town of Glenville has long been home to the annual West Virginia State Folk Festival. == Music history == West Virginia's historical contributions to musical development include WWVA Jamboree, a radio show that began in 1933 and soon became a very prominent regional show, based out of the Capitol Music Hall in Wheeling. WWVA, the radio station that has long broadcast WWVA Jamboree, hosts the Jamboree in the Hills every July in St. Clairsville, Ohio, just across the border from Wheeling.Byron, pgs. 323 - 324 The town of Oak Hill was the site of country legend Hank Williams' death, which is commemorated by a plaque in front of the public library in Oak Hill.Byron, pg. 324 Daniel Johnston, born in California, grew up in New Cumberland. ==Music festivals== {| border=\"0\" |- |valign=\"top\"| *All Good Music Festival, Masontown *Appalachian String Band Festival, Clifftop *Dvorak/Gershwin Black History Month Festival, Charleston *Gazette-Mail Kanawha County Majorette and Band Festival, Charleston *Elkhenge Music Festival, East Dailey *Festivall Charleston, Charleston *Gardner Winter Music Festival, Morgantown *Heritage Music Blues Fest, Wheeling |valign=\"top\"| *Mountain Stage NewSong Festival, Charles Town *PattyFest, Morgantown *Robin Kessinger Festival & WV State Flatpick Guitar Championship, Gandeeville *Stonewall Jackson Heritage Arts & Crafts Jubilee, Weston *Upper Potomac Dulcimer Fest, Shepherdstown *Vandalia Gathering, Charleston *West Virginia State Folk Festival, Glenville *West Virginia Independent Music Festival, Logan |} ==Notable musicians== {| border=\"0\" |- |valign=\"top\"| *Hasil Adkins, rockabilly musician *Elbern Alkire, Hawaiian guitar *Cuba Austin, jazz drummer *Leon \"Chu\" Berry, jazz saxophonist *Bobaflex, nu metal band *Andy Boarman, banjo and autoharp player *Byzantine, melodic death metal band *Mark Carman, gospel, country Grammy-nominated producer, musician, songwriter *Wilma Lee Cooper and Stoney Cooper, country *Billy Cox, bassist for Jimi Hendrix *William Jennings \"Billy\" Cox, early country singer, nicknamed the \"Dixie Songbird\" *George Crumb, composer *Hazel Dickens, bluegrass singer from Mercer County *Little Jimmy Dickens, country singer *Russel Fluharty, dulcimer player *Ed Haley, old-timey fiddler from Logan County *Hammons Family, Pocahontas county old-timey musicians, including fiddler Edden Hammons\"The Edden Hammons Collection\", WVU Press Sound Archives Series, ASIN B00004S8ZH *Hawkshaw Hawkins, country singer *Blind Joe Hill, blues singer, one-man band *Frank Hutchison, country blues and Piedmont blues musician and songwriter *Johnnie Johnson, piano player and blues musician *Dick Justice, blues and folk musician *Musa Kaleem, jazz saxophonist and flautist *Karma to Burn, progressive alternative-metal band *Robin Kessinger, National Flat Pick Champion, 1985 Walnut Valley Festival, Winfield, KS *The Lilly Brothers, bluegrass musicians *The Love Coats, acoustic rock/pop *Kathy Mattea, country singer *Mind Garage, psychedelic rock *Landau Eugene Murphy, Jr., jazz singer *John & Emery McClung Brothers & old-time musicians ca. 1930 *Tex McGuire, old-time musician *Sylvia O'Brien, a renowned banjoist *Tim O'Brien, bluegrass musician *Mollie O'Brien, bluegrass, Americana *Molly O'Day, pioneering country vocalist *Brad Paisley, country singer and songwriter from Wheeling.
