A series of lightning strike fires in the Olympic Mountains were visible from the Seattle area and lowered air quality to \"moderate\" levels as rated by the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency. On August 23, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency in 20 of Washington's 39 counties, mostly in Eastern Washington, citing limited local firefighting resources.
