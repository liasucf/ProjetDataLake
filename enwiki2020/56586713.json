    "text": "The Van Veghten House is a historic building in the Finderne section of Bridgewater Township, Somerset County, New Jersey. The house was built and served as the headquarters of Quartermaster General Nathanael Greene during the second Middlebrook encampment (1778\u201379) in the American Revolutionary War. The Somerset County Historical Society has the house as its headquarters, including a museum and library. The early-18th-century Old York Road, connecting Philadelphia to New York City, passed by here. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 10, 1979, and noted as representing \"one of the few remaining Raritan River mansions\". ==History== In 1697, Michael Van Veghten (also spelled Van Vechten, 1663\u20131737) purchased 834 acres along the Raritan River near Finderne. After his first wife died, he then married Jannetje Dumont on April 2, 1691. Their son Derrick (also spelled Dirck, 1699\u20131781) inherited the property when Michael died in 1737. During the second Middlebrook encampment, Derrick Van Veghten, a patriot of the American Revolution, gave Quartermaster General Nathanael Greene and his wife, Catharine Littlefield Greene, the use of the house for his headquarters and the farm for an encampment of his troops, without asking for any compensation. On March 19, 1779, General Greene described an event attended by General George Washington that was held at the Van Veghten House in a letter to Colonel Jeremiah Wadsworth: On August 30, 1781, the First Brigade of the French Army, the Exp\u00e9dition Particuli\u00e8re, under command of the French general Comte de Rochambeau, marched past this house, along the route to Yorktown, Virginia. The day's march was from the campground at Bullion's Tavern in Liberty Corner to the campground at Somerset Courthouse, now Millstone, New Jersey. The Second Brigade followed on August 31. The American Continental Army marched nearby along different roads as part of this joint effort. After Derrick died in 1781, the estate passed to his son Michael Van Veghten (1764\u20131831). ==Description== The house is two and a half stories plus a cellar. Brownstone is used for the foundation, and the first story features Flemish bond brickwork on the south and west walls; otherwise common bond brickwork is used. Iron beam anchors, which are both functional and decorative, are visible on the south wall by the arches of brick voussoirs above the window heads. The house was renovated in the style of Greek Revival and features four mantelpieces of that style. It is currently owned by and the headquarters for the Somerset County Historical Society, 9 Van Veghten Drive, Finderne, NJ 08807, website: https://somersethistorynj.org. ==Gallery== File:Van Veghten House, Finderne, NJ - looking west.jpg|Van Veghten House, looking west File:Van Veghten House, Finderne, NJ - brickwork detail.jpg|South wall Flemish bond brickwork, brownstone foundation, and iron beam anchors File:Derrick Van Veghten House, Finderne, NJ - information sign.jpg|Somerset County historical information File:Van Veghten House, Finderne, NJ - Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route.jpg|Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route File:Nathanael Greene by John Trumbull 1792.jpeg|Nathanael Greene, by John Trumbull, 1792 ==See also== * Van Veghten's Bridge :Other houses used as headquarters during the second Middlebrook encampment (1778\u201379): * Wallace House \u2013 General George Washington * Van Horne House \u2013 General William Alexander, Lord Stirling * Staats House \u2013 General Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben * Jacobus Vanderveer House \u2013 General Henry Knox ==References== ==External links== * * * Van Veghten House * * * * * Category:National Register of Historic Places in Somerset County, New Jersey Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in New Jersey Category:New Jersey Register of Historic Places Category:Historic house museums in New Jersey Category:Greek Revival houses in New Jersey Category:1725 establishments in the Thirteen Colonies Category:Houses completed in 1725 Category:Bridgewater Township, New Jersey Category:American Revolutionary War museums in New Jersey Category:Historic places on the Washington\u2013Rochambeau Revolutionary Route Category:Brick buildings and structures Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in New Jersey Category:American Revolution on the National Register of Historic Places Category:New Jersey in the American Revolution ",
