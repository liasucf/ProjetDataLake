Her 2005 season was cut short, and her only notable competition appearance was at the SPAR European Cup in Firenze, Italy where she won the 800 (2:00.88) and placed second in the 1500 (4:07.39). Cioncan's last competition on the top international level was the 2006 World Indoor Championships, where she failed to progress past the first heat of the 800m. Earlier that indoor season she ran an indoor personal best of 2:01.70. On January 21, 2007, Cioncan died in a car accident near Pleven, Bulgaria. She was returning from a training camp in Greece when her vehicle flipped over and struck a tree, killing her instantly. ==Achievements== {| |- !colspan=\"6\"|Representing |- |rowspan=2|1999 |rowspan=2|European U23 Championships |rowspan=2|Gothenburg, Sweden | \u2013 |800 m |DNF |- |7th |1500 m |4:14.00 |- |2001 |World Indoor Championships |Lisbon, Portugal |16th (h) |1500 m |4:17.47 |- |2002 |European Indoor Championships |Vienna, Austria |11th |3000 m |9:08.07 |- |rowspan=3|2003 |World Indoor Championships |Birmingham, United Kingdom |16th (h) |1500 m |4:14.52 |- |rowspan=2|World Championships |rowspan=2|Paris, France |9th (sf) |800 m |2:00.72 |- |9th |1500 m |4:02.80 |- |rowspan=4|2004 |rowspan=2|Olympic Games |rowspan=2|Athens, Greece |7th |800 m |1:59.62 |- |bgcolor=\"cc9966\" | 3rd |1500 m |3:58.39 |- |rowspan=2|World Athletics Final |rowspan=2|Monte Carlo, Monaco |8th |800 m |2:04.55 |- |10th |1500 m |4:08.09 |- |2006 |World Indoor Championships |Moscow, Russia |16th (h) |800 m |2:05.17 |} ===Personal bests=== *800 metres - 1:59.44 min (2004) *1500 metres - 3:58.39 min (2004) *3000 metres - 8:57.71 min (2002) ==External links== * * *http://www.focus- fen.net/index.php?id=n103809 Category:1977 births Category:2007 deaths Category:Romanian female middle-distance runners Category:People from Bistri\u021ba-N\u0103s\u0103ud County Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic athletes of Romania Category:Road incident deaths in Bulgaria Category:Olympic bronze medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Medalists at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Romania ",
