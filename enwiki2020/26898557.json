    "text": "The 1984 Summer Paralympics medal table is a list of National Paralympic Committees (NPCs) ranked by the number of gold medals won by their athletes during the 1984 Summer Paralympics, held in Stoke Mandeville, United Kingdom from July 22 to August 1, 1984, and New York City, United States, from June 17 to 30, 1984. ==Medal table== The ranking in this table is based on information provided by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and is consistent with IPC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a \"nation\" is an entity represented by a National Paralympic Committee). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IPC country code. To sort this table by nation, total medal count, or any other column, click on the image:Sort both.gif icon next to the column title. ==References== * ==See also== * 1984 Summer Olympics medal table * 1984 Winter Paralympics medal table ==External links== *International Paralympic Committee Medal table Category:Summer Paralympics medal tables ",
