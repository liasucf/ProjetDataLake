The board responded positively and in the end the entire \u00c1rmann team transferred over. Stjarnan finished first in the second-tier 1. deild kvenna in 2015 and defeated Njar\u00f0v\u00edk in the playoffs to win promotion to the top-tier \u00darvalsdeild kvenna for the first time in its history. After a disappointing first season, where high scoring guard Chelsie Schweers was fired mid-season and head coach Baldur Ingi J\u00f3nasson resigned before the seasons end, Stjarnan bounced back in 2016-2017 behind Danielle Rodriguez stellar play and made it to the playoffs. They were beaten 3-0 by Sn\u00e6fell in the semi-finals. On 13 February 2019, behind Rodriguez 33 points, including a three-point heave from just inside the half-court line to finish the first half, Stjarnan's won Brei\u00f0ablik, 103-82, in the Icelandic Cup semi-finals, advancing to the Cup finals for the first time in its history. On June 7 2019, the board of Stjarnan withdrew the team from the \u00darvalsdeild for the upcoming season and registered for the second- tier 1. deild kvenna, stating that it was necessary after several of its starters had left the team. On 22 August it was reported that the board had withdrew the team from the 1. deild kvenna after it delayed hiring a new head coach. A spokesperson for the board stated that it did not want to field a team that relied to much on non-homegrown players. The club was criticized for its actions in withdrawing the team, including by former player Ragna Margr\u00e9t Brynjarsd\u00f3ttir, especially since the argument of homegrown players did not apply to its men's team where the wast majority of players did not come up through Stjarnan's youth program. ==Season by season== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%\" !Season !Tier !League ! ! ! !Icelandic Cup |- |style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2009\u201310 | align=\"center\"|2 | 1. deild kvenna | align=\"center\" | 4th | 7\u20138 | align=\"center\"| DNQ | 1st Round |- |style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2010\u201311 | align=\"center\"|2 | 1. deild kvenna | align=\"center\" style=\"background:gold \"| 1st | 12\u20132 | bgcolor=silver|Runner-up | 1st Round |- |style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2011\u201312 | align=\"center\"|2 | 1. deild kvenna | align=\"center\" | 3rd | 11\u20134 | DNQ | 2nd Round |- |style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2012\u201313 | align=\"center\"|2 | 1. deild kvenna | align=\"center\" style=\"background:silver \"| 2nd | 12\u20134 | bgcolor=silver|Runner- up | 2nd Round |- |style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2013\u201314 | align=\"center\"|2 | 1. deild kvenna | align=\"center\" | 4th | 8\u20136 | DNQ | 1st Round |- |style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2014\u201315 | align=\"center\"|2 | 1. deild kvenna | align=\"center\" style=\"background:silver \"| 2nd | 8\u20134 | bgcolor=gold \"| Promotion | 1st Round |- |style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2015\u201316 | align=\"center\"|1 | \u00darvalsdeild kvenna | align=\"center\" | 6th | 3\u201321 | DNQ | |- |style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2016\u201317 | align=\"center\"|1 | \u00darvalsdeild kvenna | align=\"center\" | 4th | 14\u201314 | | |- |style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2017\u201318 | align=\"center\"|1 | \u00darvalsdeild kvenna | align=\"center\" | 5th | 14\u201314 | DNQ | 1st Round |- |style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2018\u201319 | align=\"center\"|1 | \u00darvalsdeild kvenna | align=\"center\" | 3rd | 18\u201310 | | style=\"background:silver \"|Runner-up |- |style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2019\u201320 |colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#efefef;text-align:center;\"| Did not participate |- |style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2020\u201321 | align=\"center\"|2 | 1. deild kvenna | align=\"center\" | TBD | 0\u20130 | TBD | TBD |- |} ==Trophies and awards== ===Trophies=== * 1. deild kvenna (1): :2011 ===Awards=== \u00darvalsdeild Women's Domestic All-First Team * Ragna Margr\u00e9t Brynjarsd\u00f3ttir \u2013 2017 \u00darvalsdeild Women's Foreign Player of the Year * Danielle Rodriguez \u2013 2018 \u00darvalsdeild Women's Defensive Player of the Year * Au\u00f0ur \u00cdris \u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir \u2013 2019 ==Notable players== {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" |- !Criteria |- | To appear in this section a player must have either: * Played at least three seasons for the club. * Set a club record or won an individual award while at the club. * Played at least one official international match for their national team at any time. * Played at least one official WNBA match at any time. |} ==Coaches== ==References== ==External links== *Official Website *Eurobasket team profile *KK\u00cd: Stjarnan \u2013 kki.is Category:Stjarnan (basketball) ",
