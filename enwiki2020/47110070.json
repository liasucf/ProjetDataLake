He also trained in Muay Thai for a couple of years before switching to mixed martial arts at the age of 22. Fighting out of Tr\u00eas Rios, he made his professional debut competing in the welterweight division in December 2011. He compiled a record of 11-2-1 (1), including a two-fight stint for Bitetti Combat while competing exclusively for regional promotions in his native Brazil. After taking a unanimous decision victory over Joilton Santos, Oliveira signed with the UFC in early 2015. ===Ultimate Fighting Championship=== Oliveira made his promotional debut as a short notice replacement against Gilbert Burns on March 21, 2015 at UFC Fight Night 62, filling in for an injured Josh Thomson.

Oliveira won the fight via KO in the third round. Oliveira faced Tim Means on December 30, 2016 at UFC 207. The bout was halted in the first round after Means landed several knees to the head of Oliveira while he was considered a grounded opponent. As a result, Oliveira was unable to continue after the foul occurred. Subsequently, referee Dan Miragliotta judged that the foul was accidental, and in turn, the result was scored a No Contest. A rematch with Means eventually took place on March 11, 2017 at UFC Fight Night 106. Oliveira won the bout via submission in the second round. Oliveira faced Ryan LaFlare on July 22, 2017 at UFC on Fox 25. He won the fight via knockout in the second round, after landing a well timed right uppercut.

Oliveira has ten children from various relationships. === Grenade attack on Christmas Eve 2018 === Oliveira suffered a leg injury and went for a surgery on Christmas Eve in 2018 to remove fragments of a grenade when he went to get gasoline for his mother\u2019s car in Tres Rios, Brazil and a grenade was thrown toward his direction while his family members were in an altercation with thugs armed with machetes, knives and a grenade. ===Incidents in May 2019=== According to reports, seemingly intoxicated Oliveira got into an altercation with a security guard during a party on May 24, 2019. In the next morning, Oliveira showed up at his wife's apartment where he allegedly assaulted her, fleeing the scene on a motorcycle with their baby daughter. The child was found on May 26 at one of Oliveira's sister's apartment, and Oliveira had generally been understood to be reported missing until his early March 2020 arrival in Las Vegas for the UFC 248 fight card which he competed on. In an interview Oliveira denied punching his wife but did not comment on other indictments. Oliveira also said they were only having an argument and that they haven't separated: on the contrary his wife is pregnant again. ==Championships and accomplishments== * Ultimate Fighting Championship ** Performance of the Night (Three times) vs Piotr Hallmann, Ryan LaFlare and Carlos Condit ** Fight of the Night (Two times) vs Yancy Medeiros, Mike Perry * ESPN ** 2017 Fight of the Year vs. Yancy Medeiros ==Mixed martial arts record== |- |Win |align=center|22\u20138\u20131 (2) |Peter Sobotta |Decision (unanimous) |UFC on ESPN: Whittaker vs. Till | |align=center|3 |align=center|5:00 |Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates | |- |Win |align=center|21\u20138\u20131 (2) |Max Griffin |Decision (split) |UFC 248 | |align=center|3 |align=center|5:00 |Las Vegas, Nevada, United States | |- |Loss |align=center|20\u20138\u20131 (2) |Nicolas Dalby |Decision (unanimous) |UFC Fight Night: Hermansson vs. Cannonier | |align=center|3 |align=center|5:00 |Copenhagen, Denmark | |- |Loss |align=center|20\u20137\u20131 (2) |Mike Perry |Decision (unanimous) |UFC Fight Night: Jacar\u00e9 vs. Hermansson | |align=center|3 |align=center|5:00 |Sunrise, Florida, United States | |- |Loss |align=center|20\u20136\u20131 (2) |Gunnar Nelson |Submission (rear naked choke) |UFC 231 | |align=center|2 |align=center|4:17 |Toronto, Ontario, Canada | |- |Win |align=center|20\u20135\u20131 (2) |Carlo Pedersoli Jr. |TKO (punches) |UFC Fight Night: Santos vs. Anders | |align=center|1 |align=center|0:39 |S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil | |- |Win |align=center|19\u20135\u20131 (2) |Carlos Condit |Submission (guillotine choke) |UFC on Fox: Poirier vs. Gaethje | |align=center|2 |align=center|3:17 |Glendale, Arizona, United States | |- |Loss |align=center|18\u20135\u20131 (2) |Yancy Medeiros |TKO (punches) |UFC 218 | |align=center|3 |align=center|2:02 |Detroit, Michigan, United States | |- |Win |align=center|18\u20134\u20131 (2) |Ryan LaFlare |KO (punch) |UFC on Fox: Weidman vs. Gastelum | |align=center|2 |align=center|1:50 |Uniondale, New York, United States | |- |Win |align=center|17\u20134\u20131 (2) |Tim Means |Submission (rear-naked choke) |UFC Fight Night: Belfort vs. Gastelum | |align=center|2 |align=center|2:38 |Fortaleza, Brazil | |- |NC |align=center|16\u20134\u20131 (2) |Tim Means |NC (illegal knees) |UFC 207 | |align=center|1 |align=center|3:33 |Las Vegas, Nevada, United States | |- |Win |align=center|16\u20134\u20131 (1) |Will Brooks |KO (punches) |UFC Fight Night: Lineker vs. Dodson | |align=center|3 |align=center|3:30 |Portland, Oregon, United States | |- |Win |align=center|15\u20134\u20131 (1) |James Moontasri |Decision (unanimous) |UFC on Fox: Holm vs. Shevchenko | |align=center|3 |align=center|5:00 |Chicago, Illinois, United States | |- |Loss |align=center|14\u20134\u20131 (1) |Donald Cerrone |Submission (triangle choke) |UFC Fight Night: Cowboy vs. Cowboy | |align=center|1 |align=center|2:33 |Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States | |- |Win |align=center|14\u20133\u20131 (1) |Piotr Hallmann |KO (punch) |UFC Fight Night: Belfort vs. Henderson 3 | |align=center|3 |align=center|0:51 |S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil | |- |Win |align=center| 13\u20133\u20131 (1) |Joe Merritt |Decision (unanimous) |UFC Fight Night: Machida vs. Romero | |align=center|3 |align=center|5:00 |Hollywood, Florida, United States | |- | Win |align=center| 12\u20133\u20131 (1) |K.J.
