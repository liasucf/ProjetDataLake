Al-Nassr were once again the defending champions for this season, having won the previous two editions in 2013\u201314 and 2014\u201315, their 7th title in total.https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/club=1895079/index.html The League comprised 14 teams, 12 from the 2014\u201315 campaign and two new teams promoted from the 2014\u201315 First Division, champions Al-Qadisiyah and Al-Wehda who replaced relegated Al-Orobah and Al-Shoulla. The League started on 19 August 2015 and concluded on 14 May 2016. On 24 April 2016, Al-Ahli won the league title after defeating Al-Hilal 3\u20131 in a home match. It was their first title since 1984 and their third overall. Al-Ahli, Al-Hilal and Al-Taawoun all secured a berth for the 2017 AFC Champions League via league position. At the bottom, Najran and Hajer were relegated to the First Division. ==Teams== First Division champions Al-Qadisiyah return for the first time since being relegated in the 2011\u201312 campaign and were joined by Al-Wehda who return after relegation in 2012\u201313 campaign. They replaced relegated sides Al-Orobah and Al-Shoulla. This brings top flight football back to Makkah and Khobar. ===Stadiums and locations=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! style=\"width:75px;\"| Team ! style=\"width:70px;\"| Home city ! style=\"width:180px;\"| Stadium ! style=\"width:75px;\"| Capacity |- | Al-Ahli | Jeddah | King Abdullah Sports City | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Al- Faisaly | Harmah | King Salman Sport City (Al Majma'ah) | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- | Al-Fateh | Al-Hasa | Prince Abdullah bin Jalawi | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Al-Hilal | Riyadh | King Fahd International | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Al-Ittihad | Jeddah | King Abdullah Sports City | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Al-Khaleej | Saihat | Prince Saud bin Jalawi (Khobar) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Al-Nassr | Riyadh | King Fahd International | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Al-Qadisiyah | Khobar | Prince Saud bin Jalawi | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Al-Raed | Buraidah | King Abdullah Sport City Stadium | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Al- Shabab | Riyadh | King Fahd International | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Al-Taawoun | Buraidah | King Abdullah Sport City Stadium | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- | Al-Wehda | Makkah | King Abdul Aziz | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- | Hajer | Al-Hasa | Prince Abdullah bin Jalawi | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Najran | Najran | Al-Akhdoud Club | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |} ;Notes ===Personnel and kits=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left; font-size:95%\" |- !

In order to preserve the chronological evolution, any postponed matches are not included to the round at which they were originally scheduled, but added to the full round they were played immediately afterwards. If a club from the Saudi Professional League wins the King Cup, they will qualify for the AFC Champions League, unless they have already qualified for it through their league position. In this case, an additional AFC Champions League group stage berth will be given to the 3rd placed team, and the AFC Champions League play-off round spot will be given to 4th. ==Results== ==Season progress== ==Relegation play-offs== Al-Raed which finished 12th will play against Al-Batin, 3rd of the 2015\u201316 Saudi First Division for a two-legged play-off. The winner on aggregate score will take part in the 2016\u201317 Saudi Professional League. Al-Raed won 5\u20133 on aggregate and secured their place in the next season. ===First leg=== ===Second leg=== ==Statistics== ===Top scorers=== {| class=wikitable |- !Rank !Scorer !Club !Goals |- !1 | Omar Al-Somah | Al-Ahli | align=center|27 |- !2 | Gelmin Rivas | Al-Ittihad | align=center|19 |- !3 | Carlos Eduardo | Al-Hilal | align=center|14 |- !4 | Abdulmajeed Al-Ruwaili | Al-Taawoun | align=center|13 |- !5 | \u00c9lton | Al-Fateh | align=center|12 |- !6 | Ali Awagi | Al-Wehda | align=center|11 |- ! rowspan=2|7 | Paul Efoulou | Al-Taawoun | align=center rowspan=2|10 |- | Adrian Mierzejewski | Al-Nassr |} ===Top assists=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Rank !Player !Club !Assists |- !1 | Jehad Al-Hussain | Al-Taawoun | align=center|10 |- !2 | Salman Al-Moasher | Al-Ahli | align=center|9 |- !3 | Fahad Al-Muwallad | Al-Ittihad | align=center|8 |- ! rowspan=2|4 | Eric Pereira | Najran | align=center rowspan=2|7 |- | Paul Efoulou | Al-Taawoun |- ! rowspan=7|6 | Adrian Mierzejewski | Al-Nassr | align=center rowspan=7|6 |- | \u00c9lton | Al-Fateh |- | Gelmin Rivas | Al-Ittihad |- | Giannis Fetfatzidis | Al-Ahli |- | Marcos Pizzelli | Al-Raed |- | Nawaf Al-Abed | Al-Hilal |- | Taisir Al-Jassim | Al-Ahli |} ===Clean sheets=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Rank !Player !Club ! !Clean Sheets |- ! rowspan=2|1 | Khalid Sharhili | Al-Hilal | align=center|20 | align=center rowspan=2|10 |- | Yasser Al-Mosailem | Al-Ahli | align=center|22 |- !3 | Mohammed Al-Owais | Al- Shabab | align=center|22 | align=center|8 |- !4 | Faisel Masrahi | Al- Qadisiyah | align=center|26 | align=center|7 |- !5 | Abdullah Al-Owaishir | Al-Fateh | align=center|19 | align=center|6 |- ! rowspan=4|6 | Assaf Al-Qarni | Al-Ittihad | align=center|15 | align=center rowspan=4|5 |- | Mansoor Al- Najai | Al-Faisaly | align=center|20 |- | Moslem Al Freej | Al-Khaleej | align=center|22 |- | Fayz Al-Sabiay | Al-Taawoun | align=center|22 |} ===Hat- tricks=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !
