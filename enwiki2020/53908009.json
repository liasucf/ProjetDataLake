They are active from mid summer to fall. == Distribution and Habitat == O. vulgare is distributed across much of North America. They prefer fields and low meadows, where they perch on clumps of grass. They adapt best in moderate temperature climates, and cannot handle extreme heat or humidity. == Identification == O. vulgare can be characterized by their red eyes, green faces, and a distinctly curved ovipositor. They have green bodies and brown legs that allow for them to camouflage themselves with their environment. Two black lines can be found on their dorsal shield. The size ranges from 22\u201340 mm with the females being larger than the males. == Diet == This species is known to consume a variety of plant species. It has even been recorded eating other Orthoptera. == Ecology == O. vulgare like most katydids, functions as a food source for other organisms. ==References== vulgare Category:Insects described in 1862 ",
