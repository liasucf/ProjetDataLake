He identifies and executes projects that affect change in the short term and continue to deliver positive long-term effects with minimum intervention and investment. His philanthropic process is one of taking up relevant projects only after fully understanding the needs of the local community. This is followed by executing the project in the minimum amount of time while meeting all the set goals. Once the project is completed, he sets long-term goals for local community members to ensure that the project delivers the right results for the maximum amount of time. Every project is handheld for a brief period of time until it starts producing the desired results. Instead of keeping it as a one-way monologue, he believes in fully engaging with the local stakeholders to increase the projects' viability, effectiveness, sustainability, and overall reach. == References == Category:Living people Category:Indian billionaires Category:1953 births ",
