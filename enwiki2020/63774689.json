Scantrust solutions offer protection and traceability for various industries, such as luxury goods, food products, industrial machines, water filters, cables, agrochemical products and fiscal stamps. Nathan J. Anderson is the current Scantrust CEO == History == Justin Picard, Nathan J. Anderson, and Paul Landry founded Scantrust at the end of 2013, and the company won the VentureKick prize in 2014. A seed round led by SOSV was raised in 2015, and a series A led by Credit Suisse was raised in 2017. In 2016, the company concluded a partnership with Agfa-Gevaert to integrate its solution into Agfa's security software. In 2017 the National Seeds Institute of Argentina released a fiscal stamp printed with Scantrust secure QR Code. The same year, Scantrust was chosen by VentureKick as Global Shaper for year 2013. In 2018, at a hackathon organised by the European Commission \"to shape and deliver the future anti- counterfeiting infrastructure\", Scantrust and BigChainDB won both the consumer challenge and the customs challenge (team name Fides). It also entered into a partnership with Hyperledger and implemented blockchain-enabled traceability using Hyperledger Sawtooth. In 2019, the Dutch Standards organisation NEN announced they would use Scantrust secure QR codes to ensure the authenticity of their certificates. The same year, Scantrust entered into a partnership with HP Indigo to integrate its solution on labels printed with HP commercial printers. In 2020, Scantrust entered into a partnership with SAP to deliver an end-to-end traceability solution. ==Product authentication and traceability== The company has developed a QR Code system with an additional layer of protection against copying, based on inserting a copy detection pattern or secure graphic which loses information when it is copied. The technology does not require special materials, inks, and modifications to printing equipment to implement. Related product authentication and traceability data can be stored into a blockchain. QR Codes used in Scantrust authentication and traceability systems are printed on product packaging and scanned with a smartphone to authenticate and track products. The company provides a free app to consumers which can be used to scan products with the copy detection pattern and help detect counterfeits. Scanning of a code with a smartphone can also offer a traceability feature with origin and supply chain information made about the product made availableAli, I., Satie, S., & Thai, V. (2020).

Page 2. \"An IoT- supported digital food packaging system (for example, ScanTrust) integrates internet with 2-D bar codes (Hadsel-Mares, 2017) printed on labels, cartons, and documents. Scanning of a code with a smartphone allows consumers to trace back information about the product and actively converse with the products\u2019 supplier(s). Barcodes also allow businesses to track the product at all stages through the distribution channel and to facilitate the collection of statistics about individual consumers, thus potentially improve the control of product quality along the SC and facilitate response to customers\u2019 needs in a more effective way (Hadsel-Mares, 2017).\" An enterprise app is also provided for employees, distributors and forensic inspections. == References == == External links == * *BigChainDB Website Category:Technology companies of Switzerland Category:Technology companies established in 2013 Category:2013 establishments in Switzerland ",
