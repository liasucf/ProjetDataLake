The village is in the north part of the parish and is located two miles (3 km) south of the town of Newton Abbot, from the seaside resort of Torquay and from the city of Plymouth. The A381 road between Newton Abbot and Totnes runs down the western side of the parish and the main railway line between these two towns forms part of its eastern boundary. ==History== The settlement that is now Abbotskerswell was called C\u00e6rswylle in 956, Carsvelle in 1086 and Kareswill in 1242, meaning 'cress spring' from the Old English c\u00e6rse + wylle. The name 'Abbotskerswell' itself is derived from 'Kerswell belonging to the abbot' [of Horton] and was recorded as Karswill Abbatts in 1285, Abbotescharswelle in 1314 and Abbots Keswell in 1675. In the Domesday Book Abbotskerswell was listed as Carsuella in the ancient hundred of Kerswell, and was held by the abbot of Horton Abbey, Dorset.Open Domesday Online: Abbotskerswell, accessed July 2017 The name kerswell means cress spring.
