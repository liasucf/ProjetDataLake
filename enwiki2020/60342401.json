The book follows Neverfell, the apprentice and adopted daughter of the cheese maker Grandible, as she becomes entangled in a net of conspiracies and betrayal.

The Guardian writes \"One of the most joyous aspects of A Face Like Glass is that, from a brilliant premise, Hardinge goes on to weave a richly textured world in which that premise fits naturally, and the reader is able to suspend their disbelief.\" NPR writes: \"Let me begin by stating that this is a perfect book. [...] It's perfect in the way that excellent clockwork is perfect: intricate, precise, and hiding all its marvels in plain sight.\" Kirkus Reviews writes \"Hardinge excels at wordplay and worldbuilding; witty but not trite, her utterly original setting and chaotic, fidgety protagonist anchor a cracking good story that raises important ideas surrounding the nature of friendship, the value of honesty, and the danger of too much, whether luxury, ambition, power, or desire.\" == References == Category:2012 British novels Category:British fantasy novels ",
