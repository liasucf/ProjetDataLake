He studied at the Vienna Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. After graduating, he joined Max Reinhardt in Berlin in 1911 and then Leopold Jessner in 1916. After his breakthrough performance in Ernst Toller's Transfiguration in 1919, he became one of Germany's best-known character actors and the nation's foremost performer of Expressionist works. He also appeared in over ninety films beginning in 1916. His specialty was in playing sinister and threatening roles, although he also appeared in the title role of Dreyfus (1930). He originally gained attention for his explosive energy on stage and his powerful voice, but as the 1920s progressed his work began to incorporate greater realism as he opted for a more controlled delivery and greater use of gestures. With the coming to power of the Nazis, the Jewish Kortner fled Germany in 1933, returning first to his native Vienna and, from there, on to Great Britain, and finally, in 1937, to the United States,\"The Jewish Actor Who Would Not Be Intimidated\", forward.com; accessed 10 February 2018. where he found work as a character actor and theater director. He returned to Germany in 1949, where he became noted for his innovative staging and direction of classics by William Shakespeare and Moli\u00e8re, such as a Richard III (1964) in which the king crawls over piles of corpses at the finale. ==Death== Kortner died at Munich in 1970, aged 78, of leukemia. ==Selected filmography== * Manya, die T\u00fcrkin (1915) * Im Banne der Vergangenheit (1915) * Das Geheimnis von D.14 (1915) * Police Nr. 1111 (1915) - Mac Waldy * Das zweite Leben (1916) * Martyr of His Heart (1918) - Ludwig van Beethoven * The Other I (1918) - Professor * Frauenehre (1918, Short) - Mathias Enger * Der Sonnwendhof (1918) * Else of Erlenhof (1919) * The Eye of the Buddha (1919) - indischer Diener * Without Witnesses (1919) * Satan (1920) - Pharao Amenhotep * Gerechtigkeit (1920) * Va banque (1920) - S.
