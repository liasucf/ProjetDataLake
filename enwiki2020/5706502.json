Every year, during the Labour Day weekend in September, the community welcomes people from everywhere for their Annual Labour Day Picnic. In 2008, Quinan celebrated its 125th Annual Picnic. There are activities like bingo, rose tables and rides. Each Spring, the community hosts a Wild Game Evening that includes a supper and auction that attracts more people than can be served.
