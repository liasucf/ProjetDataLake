It\u2019s a solid stalk and chase slasher film mixing \u201cDeath Proof\u201d and \u201cThe Hitcher\u201d and director Pavia delivers a strong genre entry suitable for a lazy Friday night and some beers.\u201c Vasquez Jr., Felix.

Retrieved 2016-07-19 Matt Donato of We Got This Covered was more lukewarm indicating that although \u201cMakenzie Vega asserts herself as a future genre star,\u201d \u201cfilmmaker Mark Pavia dilutes an original idea with stale, musty slasher generics that have been dominating too many of my reviews lately. A select few moments shine \u2013 mostly involving gnarly gore effects \u2013 but the sum of this creepy driver\u2019s rampage is nothing but a bland home invasion/slasher wannabe told through a weak, timid voice.\u201d Donato, Matt.

Retrieved 2016-07-19 Jake Dee of The Joblo Network rates the film a 5 out of 10 citing lack of originality and \u201cover-trampled\u201d \u201cHalloween-like tropes\u201das drawbacks while redemption comes in the slick pacing and ever increasing gore and violence culminating in its avoidance of a pat Hollywood ending which \u201cmake the movie a bit better than perhaps it should be.\u201d Dee, Jake.
