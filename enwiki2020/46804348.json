    "text": "Bruce George Lindsay (March 7, 1947 \u2013 May 5, 2015) was an American statistician best known for his contributions to mixture modeling and likelihood theory. ==Biography== Lindsay was born in 1947 in The Dalles, Oregon. He has earned a B.A. in mathematics from the University of Oregon in 1969 and a Ph.D. in biomathematics from the University of Washington in 1978. Between his undergraduate and graduate studies he has served in the U.S. Coast Guard for four years during the Vietnam War. Centre Daily Times obituary, May 10, 2015 He joined the Pennsylvania State University faculty in 1979, heading the Department of Statistics in 1998 - 2000 and 2006 - 2012, and rising to the rank of Eberly Chair in Statistics in 2012. He was also a Visiting Professor at the Johns Hopkins University in 1987, the Yale University in 1990, and North Carolina State University in 2004-2005. He was elected to be a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics in 1987, of the Guggenheim Foundation in 1996, and of the American Statistical Association in 1998. ==Selected publications== * Lindsay, Bruce G. \"Mixture models: theory, geometry and applications.\" NSF-CBMS regional conference series in probability and statistics.
