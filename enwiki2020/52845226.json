    "text": "Modular Surface of The Upsilon function The Upsilon function, , is a function of a complex variable s that analytically continues the sum of the infinite series :\\Upsilon(s) =\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac 1 {n^2+s^2} for s eq ki, k\\in\\mathbb{Z}-\\\\{0\\\\} It was suggested in 2016 by Mohamad Emami and Alireza Jamali, analogous to the Riemann zeta function. ==Definition== The original Upsilon function is defined as :\\Upsilon(s) =\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac 1 {n^2+s^2} = \\frac \\pi {2s} \\coth(\\pi s) - \\frac 1 {2s^2} For all complex numbers s\\in\\mathbb{C}-\\\\{ki \\in\\mathbb{Z}\\mid k eq 0\\\\} . The Upsilon function \u03a5(s) is a meromorphic function of a complex variable s, which has isolated singularities at points ki where k is a non-zero integer. At point s=0 the function has a removable singularity; one can readily remove this singular point by assigning the value \\zeta(2)=\\frac{\\pi^2}{6} ( see Basel problem ). The Upsilon function is actually Generalized Upsilon function of order \u03c0 when the generalized Upsilon function of order u is defined as : \\Upsilon_ u(s)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac 1 {s^2 + (\\frac{n\\pi} u)^2} = \\frac u {2s}\\coth( u s)-\\frac{1}{2s^2} ==Singularities== Anyway, we know that at s=0 the function has a removable singularity and we can remove it as mentioned above. ==Roots and Upsilon conjecture== It was conjectured by Emami and Jamali that All roots of the Upsilon function have the form of s=ix for all x\\in\\mathbb{R}-\\\\{0\\\\} satisfying the equation \\pi x=\\tan\\pi x . So far, it is not known whether all roots are of the above form or not, leaving it as an open problem (Upsilon conjecture). ==Specific values== *\\Upsilon_1(\\log\\sqrt{x})=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac 1 {(\\log\\sqrt{x})^2 +(n\\pi)^2} = \\frac 1 {2\\log x} \\left(\\frac{x+1}{x-1} - \\frac 1 {\\log x}\\right) ::Known as the Jamali's identity, first appeared in a paper by Alireza Jamali and Mohamad Emami. *\\Upsilon_\\pi(0)=\\zeta(2)=\\frac{\\pi^2}6. See Basel problem. *\\Upsilon_1(\\log\\varphi) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac 1 {(\\log\\varphi)^2 + (n\\pi)^2} = \\frac 1 {2\\log\\varphi} \\left(\\sqrt{5}-\\frac 1 {\\log\\varphi}\\right), where \u03c6 is the Golden Ratio (Jamali's series).
