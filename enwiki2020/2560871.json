It was published by the University of Chicago's Journal of Political Economy. It synthesized differential game-theoretic models of capitalism, due to Kelvin Lancaster and Richard M. Goodwin. Gale's general equilibrium handbooks on monetary economics acknowledge Merhling's assistance.* * == Money View == Perry Mehrling's brainchild, the Money View, is a monetary-financial school of thought that links the (usually separate) intellectual realms of economics and finance. It offers an integrated approach for conceptualizing money, finance and (shadow) banking, which it sees as the fundamental infrastructure of capitalismPerry Mehrling, 2017. \"Financialization and its discontents\", Finance and Society 3(1), pp. 1\u201310.. Other than most economic theories, it denotes analytical importance to the notion of liquidity as well as to the centrality of profit-seeking dealers as market makers. The Money View has first been developed, formulated and put forward by Mehrling and is now - despite still being an academic minority view - popularized by scholarsSteffen Murau, 2017. \"Shadow Money and the Public Money Supply: The Impact of the 2007-09 Financial Crisis on the Monetary System\", Review of International Political Economy 24(5)., central bankers and market practitionersZoltan Pozsar, 2014. \"Shadow Banking: The Money View\", Office of Financial Research 14(4).Perry Mehrling, Zoltan Pozsar, James Sweeney, Daniel Neilson, 2013. \"Bagehot was a shadow banker: shadow banking, central banking, and the future of global finance\", Shadow Banking Within and Across BordersWorld Scientific Publishing Company. around the world. === Description === The speciality of the Money View it its ability to adequately synthesize current features of our integrated monetary and financial system, which Mehrling describes as 'money market funding of capital market lending', a.k.a. shadow banking, by paying attention to both the money market and the capital market. The Money View includes elements of theories and insights by H.P. Minsky, Charles Kindleberger, Marcia Stigum, to name just a few. === Central institutions === Money, as a means of payment, to facilitate (final) settlement. Credit, as a promise to pay (money). Finance, to facilitate valuation of promises to pay. Banking, as a means of allocation of credit.Perry Mehrling, 2017. \"Financialization and its discontents\", Finance and Society 3(1), pp. 1\u201310. === Hierarchy of Money === Inspired by Minsky's Hierarchy of Money, the Money View recognizes the de facto inequality of economic agents or entire countries in their capacity to issue something called money. A privileged few at the top of the hierarchy may issue money while the rest can only issue mere promises to pay money, i.e. credit (further down the hierarchy). The US dollar is at the top of the international hierarchy of money. === Politics === The Money View is inherently political. Its political dimensions are manifold and include the following: * a direct application of values the Enlightenment as a philosophical movement purports (by, inter alia, sustaining from vulgar assumptions on the nature of human beings that often prevails in economics, such as the homo economicus) *ideas centered on reason as the primary source of knowledge * a recognition of the \"difficulty of money\" * an open rejection of equilibrium accounts of the economy (and therefore of mainstream economic thought & teaching) * a refutation of the quantity theory of money * critical thinking about the monetary-financial system (as opposed to proficient manipulation of formal models) * an emphasis on liquidity as compared to solvency === Epistemology === The Money View relies on comparatively few assumptions and uses reason as the primary source of knowledge. Generally, its analytical framework is based on viewing every monetary entity in terms of their stylized balance sheet, which serves as basic tools for asset-liability management, i.e. to measure sources and uses of funding. The Money View has been categorized by Zoltan Pozsar as 'monetary reality' (in contrast to monetary theory) because of its reliance on balance sheets and T-accounts. == References == == External links == * Perry Mehrling at Barnard College / Columbia University Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American economists Category:Barnard College faculty Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Institute for New Economic Thinking ",
