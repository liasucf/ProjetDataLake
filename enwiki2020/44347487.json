    "text": "The 2014 Portugal legionellosis outbreak was an outbreak caused by Legionella bacteria in multiple cities of Portugal's Lisboa district. It began in November 2014 in P\u00f3voa de Santa Iria, Forte da Casa and Vialonga (Vila Franca de Xira, Lisbon). As of 5 December 2014, 336 people have become infected and eleven have died. Cases in Luanda, Angola and Lima, Peru were suspected to be connected to the outbreak, but were later found to be unrelated. Paulo Macedo, the Health Minister, declared the outbreak over on 21 November. He stated however that, new deaths could be registered. ==Sources== The source of the outbreak is yet to be discovered. Authorities have stated that the source may be a public location such as a water conduct and that more cases are to be expected. The source is being tracked and water sample analysis are to be performed. A total of 20 locations were examined on November 8. Another 5 locations, 4 factories and 1 hotel, have been examined on November 9. No traces so far of the bacteria have been discovered. Up until now, the infected individuals have not been found to have participated in the same events in the last 14 days. On 11 November, Solvay confirmed that the first results from their factory in P\u00f3voa de Santa Iria came positive for Legionella, but the results of more comprehensive tests, done at Ricardo Jorge National Health Institute (INSA) are not available yet. These tests include samples from other factories in the region, such as Adubos de Portugal (ADP) and Central de Cervejas. Later on the same day, it was also reported that the ADP factory will be further investigated. It is expected that the new investigation will shed some light on whether there was criminal activity behind the outbreak. On 21 November, it was confirmed that the ADP factory was the source of the outbreak. ==Current status== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto;\" ! Date !! Cases !! Fatalities !!
