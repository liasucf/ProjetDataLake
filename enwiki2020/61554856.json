    "text": "The tenth series of The Great British Bake Off began on 27 August 2019, with this being the third series to be broadcast on Channel 4. It is presented by returning hosts Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig, and judged by returning judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith. The series was won by David Atherton, who became the first winner never to have won the Star Baker title since it was introduced. Alice Fevronia and Steph Blackwell finished as runners-up. This series started with 13 bakers instead of the usual 12, which meant one episode featured a double elimination, as was previously done in the fourth series. == Bakers == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
