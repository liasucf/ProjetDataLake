The car has been badge engineered and sold as the Daihatsu Materia, Scion xB and Subaru Dex. __TOC__ == First generation (XP30; 2000\u20132005) == The first generation bB was based on the Toyota Vitz and the development was led by Toyota chief engineer Tetsuya Tada. While the box- shaped mini MPV was initially targeted towards Japanese men in their twenties, it is also popular with women buyers, and has also been at least privately imported to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand. Production of the bB occurred between January 2000 and April 2005 at the Takaoka plant in Toyota, Aichi. Production occurred at the former Central Motors between August 2004 and December 2005 for the bB; export Scion xB model continued until December 2006. === Engines === Engine choices include 1.3- and 1.5-litre inline-four engines. === Marketing === In the United States, the first generation bB was sold under the Scion brand as the xB from June 2003 to 2007. For the Scion xB, the front passenger area was also changed significantly with the bB's front bench seat replaced with bucket seats and the column-mounted shifter changed to a floor-mounted shifter. === Open Deck (2000\u20132001) === The bB Open Deck was a coupe utility version of the bB. === Gallery === File:2000 Toyota bB 02.jpg|Japanese spec bB File:06-Scion- xB.jpg|North American spec xB File:2004-Scion-xB-RS-1.0.jpg|xB Release Series 1.0 variant File:Toyota bB Open Deck 004.JPG|bB Open Deck == Second generation (QNC20; 2005\u20132016) == The second generation bB was unveiled at the 2005 Tokyo Motor Show. Production version went on sale in Netz dealers. The second generation Scion xB is not based on the bB, but was specifically designed by Toyota to appeal to American buyers, which was sold in Japan as Toyota Corolla Rumion. Badge engineered Daihatsu and Subaru models were also produced, but production ceased in 2012, leaving just the Toyota model. Production of the Toyota model was also ceased in May 2016, with sales ended in Japan in July 2016, and it was replaced by the Toyota Tank and its twin counterpart the Toyota Roomy, which is a rebadged Daihatsu Thor. === Design === The vehicle was designed as \"A Car-shaped Music Player\" to hopefully satisfy the preferences of the younger generation. The Daihatsu version can be identified by a wider and shallower grille and indicator layout. === Body styles === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Chassis codes!!(DBA-)QNC21-BHSGK!!(DBA-)QNC25-BHSGK!!(DBA-)QNC20-BHSXK!!(DBA-)QNC25-BHSXK |- |Model||Z 1.5 2WD||Z 1.3 4WD||S 1.3 2WD||S 1.3 4WD |- |Drive||FWD||4WD||FWD||4WD |- |Engine||3SZ-VE||K3-VE||K3-VE||K3-VE |} === Engines === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Code!!Type/code!!Power, torque@rpm |- |3SZ-VE|| (72.0 mm x 91.8 mm) I4|| @6000, @4400 |- |\"3SZ-VET\" (South Africa)|| (72.0 mm x 91.8 mm) I4|| @5750, @4800 |- |K3-VE|| (72.0 mm x 79.7 mm) I4|| @6000, @4400 |} === Transmissions === All models include Super ECT 4-speed automatic transmission. === Daihatsu Coo/Materia === Daihatsu Coo (Japan) The Daihatsu Materia (Daihatsu Coo in Japan) replaced the Daihatsu YRV and is largely identical to the second generation of the Toyota bB.
