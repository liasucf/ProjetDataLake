In 1975, McCully returned to the NASL with the Hartford Bicentennials. In 1976, Hartford traded him to the Washington Diplomats. He retired at the end of the season. McCully was regarded as someone with a nose for the goal, and a player with eyes in the back of his head (he was extremely aware of every man's position on the pitch). Charlie was also regarded as a great teacher of the game. He always had time to talk and mentor the younger players. He was a very giving person. ==National team== McCully earned eleven caps with the U.S. national team between 1973 and 1975. His first game with the national team came in a 1\u20130 win over Poland on August 12, 1973. His last game was a 2\u20130 loss to Mexico on August 25, 1975 in the Mexico Cup.
