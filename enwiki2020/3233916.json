In need of first-team experience, he joined Doncaster Rovers on loan in December 2003,Rovers sign Hynes making his league debut on 13 December 2003 when he came on as a late substitute for Gregg Blundell in Rovers' 3\u20131 defeat away to Cheltenham Town.

Despite scoring the late winner which consummated Dublin City's memorable reversal of a 0\u20132 deficit into a 3\u20132 victory away to Derry City late in the 2004 season. In contrast to his uninspired form with Dublin City, Hynes proved markedly more productive in the colours of Dundalk, whom he joined in 2005, scoring six goals from midfield in 2005. He formed, alongside Philip Hughes (with whom he played at Dublin City) one half of a prolific forward pairing which manoeuvred Dundalk into a strong position in the League of Ireland First Division. However, he was released by Dundalk following a breach of club discipline on 14 November 2006. In January 2007 he joined Newry City,Newry include new signings but just over a month later on 28 February (the transfer deadline day for League of Ireland clubs), he signed for Derry City.\"City add striker to squad: Peter Hynes signs from Newry\", CityWeb, 28 February 2007. The clubs agreed that Hynes would move for free but the agreement also contained a clause which would allow his former club to claim 30% of any future transfer fee if the player was to be sold on. However, Hynes was not initially eligible to play for Derry City as FIFA's rules stated that no player could play for more than two different clubs between 1 July of one season and 30 June of the following year. In Hynes' case, he had already played for both Dundalk and Newry City between 1 July 2006 and his signing for Derry City in February 2007.\"Clubs hit with two-club ruling\", Eleven-a-side.ie, 9 March 2007. The Football Association of Ireland argued that, as they ran a league with an unconventional Summer season, such a state of affairs ought to be permissible for players playing in the League of Ireland. With two weeks of the league season completed the association had yet to come to an agreement with FIFA. The player's clearance eventually came on 5 April.\"FIFA grant clearance to Hynes \", FAI eircom League, 5 April 2007. When Hynes was finally granted eligibility to play for Derry he struggled to make an impact with the candystripes. He was loaned out during the July transfer window to UCD for whom he made 8 appearances. Hynes parted ways with Derry City at the end of the 2007 season to join new League of Ireland franchise Sporting Fingal who were making their debut in the 2008 First Division.
