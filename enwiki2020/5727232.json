His voice matured early into its adult timbre, and at the age of 15, he auditioned for conductor Francesco Molinari-Pradelli, who encouraged him to pursue an operatic career. He began vocal studies with Ettore Campogalliani, and was accepted at age 16 as a student at the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory in Milan. He then continued his studies in Rome, under the guidance of Teresa Pediconi and Armando Piervenanzi. After having won the National Competition for young opera singers in Spoleto, he made his debut in the same city in the role of Colline in La Boh\u00e8me in the Festival dei Due Mondi. Subsequently, an opportunity arose for him at the Teatro dell'Opera in Rome when he was called upon to substitute in the role of Procida in Giuseppe Verdi's I Vespri Siciliani, and he received enormous success from the public and the critics. The young singer was very shy and stiff at first, but his early directors helped him, and he was soon an accomplished opera actor. ===Opera, film and television star=== Raimondi's career soon extended to the major opera houses in Italy, such as La Fenice in Venice, the Teatro Regio in Turin, Teatro Comunale in Florence and abroad, beginning with the Glyndebourne Festival (Don Giovanni in 1969). His La Scala debut was as Timur in Turandot in 1968, his Metropolitan Opera debut was as Silva in Ernani in 1970, and his Covent Garden debut was as Fiesco in Simon Boccanegra in 1972. In 1975, he made his Paris Opera debut as Procida, followed by the title role in Boris Godunov, and his Salzburg Festival debut in 1980 as the King in Aida. In 1986, he first directed a production of Don Giovanni, and decided to continue his career as a director as well. Some of his most important roles have been King Philip in Verdi's Don Carlos; Fiesco; the title roles in Boris Godunov (including the Andrzej \u017bu\u0142awski film) and Attila; Silva; Escamillo in Bizet's Carmen (including the Francesco Rosi film, 1984, with Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Julia Migenes); the title role in Don Giovanni (including the Joseph Losey film, 1979); Count Almaviva in The Marriage of Figaro; and Don Alfonso in Cos\u00ec fan tutte; the title role in Don Quichotte by Massenet; and Scarpia in a recording of Tosca produced by Ardermann and later filmed live from Rome, with Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Catherine Malfitano, conducted by Zubin Mehta. He also made the television film Six characters in search of a singer. In 2008 he appeared in the Mini-Series \"Les Sanglot des Anges\" on French TV, in which he played the role of an Italian opera singer. In July 2011 he played the role of Pagano in Verdi's I Lombardi alla prima crociata on the rooftop of the Duomo of Milan. The concert was organized to celebrate the 150th Anniversary of the Italian Unity by the Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo di Milano . ==Recordings== ===Audio recordings=== *Mozart: Don Giovanni | Sony | 1978 *Mozart: Le nozze di Figaro | Decca | 1985 *Mussorgsky: Boris Godunov | Erato | 1989 *Puccini: Turandot | Deutsche Grammophon | 1981 *Puccini: Tosca | Deutsche Grammophon | 1979 *Rossini: Il barbiere di Siviglia | Deutsche Grammophon | 1993 *Rossini: Il barbiere di Siviglia | EMI | 1973-74 *Rossini: Il barbiere di Siviglia (w/bonus DVD) DVD | Decca | 1993 *Rossini: Il viaggio a Reims | Deutsche Grammophon | 1984 *Rossini: La Cenerentola| Decca | 1987 *Rossini: L'italiana in Algeri | Deutsche Grammophon | 1989 *Verdi: Aida | Deutsche Grammophon | 1981 *Verdi: I Vespri Siciliani | RCA Red Seal | 1973 *Verdi: Attila | Philips | 1972 *Verdi: Don Carlos | Deutsche Grammophon | 1985 *Verdi: Un ballo in maschera | Deutsche Grammophon | 1980 *Verdi: I Masnadieri | Phillips | 1975 ===TV=== *2008 : Le Sanglot des Anges, mini series directed by Jacques Otmezguine *2005 : Cos\u00ec fan tutte staged by Patrice Ch\u00e9reau *2001 : Il turco in Italia with Cecilia Bartoli at Zurich Opera House *1992 : Glyndebourne Festival Opera: a Gala Evening Directed by Christopher Swann *1992 : Tosca: In the Settings and at the Times of Tosca, Directed by Brian Large (with Malfitano and Domingo) *1992 : Le nozze di Figaro Directed by Brian Large *1991 : Jos\u00e9 Carreras and Friends: Opera Recital *1985 : Faust staged by Ken Russell at the Vienna State Opera *1983 : The Metropolitan Opera Centennial Gala Directed by Kirk Browning *1983 : Ernani Directed by Kirk Browning (with Milnes and Pavarotti) *1982 : Verdi's Requiem *1981 : Six personnages en qu\u00eate d'un chanteur by Maurice B\u00e9jart *1980 : Boris Godunov staged by Joseph Losey at Op\u00e9ra National de Paris ==Filmography== *2019 : Beaux-parents by H\u00e9ctor Cabello Reyes *2001 : Tosca by Beno\u00eet Jacquot, with Angela Gheorghiu & Roberto Alagna *1997 : Les couleurs du Diable by Alain Jessua *1989 : Boris Godunov by Andrzej \u017bu\u0142awski *1984 : Carmen by Francesco Rosi, with Pl\u00e1cido Domingo *1983 : La vie est un roman by Alain Resnais *1982 : La Truite by Joseph Losey *1979 : Don Giovanni by Joseph Losey, with Jos\u00e9 van Dam, Kiri Te Kanawa == Honours == * : Commander of the Order of Cultural Merit (November 1999)Sovereign Ordonnance n\u00b0 14.274 of 18 Nov. 1999 : promotions or nominations ==See also== * Debussy: Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (Herbert von Karajan recording) == References == * ==External links== *Raimondi website *Profile of Raimondi dead link 01/11/10 *Answers.com profile * *Interview with Ruggero Raimondi, November 16, 1987 Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century Italian opera singers Category:Operatic bass-baritones Category:Grammy Award winners Category:People from Bologna Category:Italian theatre directors Category:Commanders of the Order of Cultural Merit (Monaco) Category:20th- century male singers Category:21st-century Italian opera singers Category:21st-century male singers ",
