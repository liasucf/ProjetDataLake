    "text": "The International One Metre (IOM) is a class of Radio Sailing Boat used for racing under the World Sailing - Racing Rules of Sailing. It is a measurement- controlled box rule originally created by the ISAF-RSD (now the International Radio Sailing Association) in 1988 in an attempt to harmonise the various one metre rules created around the world. The IOM Class Rules specify a standardised sail plan and control of the other major performance dimensions (displacement, length, and draught) while allowing some freedom in hull design. The IOM is now the largest and arguably most competitive of all radio sailing classes. ==History== The International One Metre Class Association was formed in 2003 as an owners association to support the class and promote racing. This function was originally carried out by the International Radio Sailing Associationhttp://www.radiosailing.org/ (previously known as the ISAF- RSD or Radio Sailing Division). The continuing association with IRSA entitles the class to hold World Championships officially recognised by the World Sailing.https://www.sailing.org/classesandequipment/IOM.php ==Events== ===World Champions=== ===European Champions=== {| |- |border 1996, Fleetwood 60 Boats | Own Design Redwine | | |- |border 1998, Leixoes 53 Boats | Own Design Ikon | Design Scoop | Design Mirage |- |border 2000, St Cyr 74 Boats | Design Widget | Design Ikon | Own Design Italiko |- |border 2002, Fleetwood 80 Boats | Design Widget | | |- |border 2004, Arcos della Frontera 82 Boats | Own Design Topiko | Design Isotonic | Design Ikon |- |2006 |NOT HELD | | |- |border 2008, Dubrovnik 70 Boats | Design - | Design Pikantot | Design Topiko |- |border 2010, Pierrelatte 70 Boats | Design Pikanto | Own Design BritPOP | Own Design Pikanto' |- |border 2012, Cres, 76 Boats | Own Design BritPOP | Own Design Kantun | Design BritPOP |- |border 2014, Campione del Garda 76 Boats | Own Design POP | Design BritPOP | Design BritPOP |- |border 2016, Vitoria 76 Boats | Own Design POP | Design BritPOP | Design BritPOP |- |border 2018, Split https://www.radiosailing.org/championship-history/one-metre- champions 76 Boats | Own Design Kantun 2 | Design Kantun 2 | Design BritPOP|- |} ==References== ==External links== * Official One Metre Class Association Website * International Radio Sailing Association Website * ISAF One Metre Microsite Website Category:Classes of the International Radio Sailing Association Category:Keelboats Category:Development sailing classes ",
