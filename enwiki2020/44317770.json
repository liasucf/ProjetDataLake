Loreen turned the guitar pop track into a moody, electronic ballad which starts out with just her voice and some synths, but halfway through explodes with a lush production and more vocal power. Michael from 'A Bit of Pop Music said; \"This type of moody electro ballads suits her powerful and mystical sounding vocals the best.\" requesting more of this on her second album. Scandipop said; \"\"Under Ytan\" [is] a stark and dramatic new production that builds into something special.\" In 2017, Kikki Danielsson recorded the song during S\u00e5 mycket b\u00e4ttre. The song was then called \"At the Border\", depicting the situation of refugees throughout the world. == References == Category:1994 singles Category:2015 singles Category:Swedish songs Category:Swedish-language songs Category:1994 songs Category:Songs written by Uno Svenningsson Category:Kikki Danielsson songs Category:Loreen (singer) songs Category:Uno Svenningsson songs ",
