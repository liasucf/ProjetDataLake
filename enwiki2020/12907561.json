The center hosts an IMAX 3D theatre, an energy park, a hall of science, Planet Earth, an amphitheatre, Life Science Park and dancing musical fountains among others. The center also provides housing for students preparing for science exams. For last few years, a program called \"Vacation Training Program on Bioresources for school children\" is being organised by Science city with the help of government funds to encourage students regarding Bioresources. It is a month-long program for students who gave their SSC exams, each from every district of the state. As of 2012, Science City is awaiting the opening of a long-anticipated Earth Pavilion - an earth-shaped dome created in 2009 whose goal is to showcase live experiences with natural disasters. The Pavilion will detail each continent and allow visitors to participate in hands-on activities. ==See also== * Science Centre, Surat * Swami Vivekananda Planetarium, Mangalore ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Museums in Ahmedabad Category:Science museums in India Category:Education in Gujarat Category:Science and technology in Gujarat ",
