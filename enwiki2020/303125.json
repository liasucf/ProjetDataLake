He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball from 1971 to 1987 for the Milwaukee Brewers, Kansas City Royals, St. Louis Cardinals, and Texas Rangers. The four-time All-Star was known for his excellent defensive skills and power hitting ability. He struggled but was never able to overcome a substance abuse problem, yet went on to become the most valuable player of the 1982 World Series with the St. Louis Cardinals. Porter died from an accidental drug overdose in 2002 at the age of 50. ==Biography== ===Playing career=== Born in Joplin, Missouri, Porter was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the first round of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft. He made his major league debut on September 2, 1971, with the Brewers at age 19. He finished third in the Rookie of the Year voting.1973 American League Rookie of the Year voting results at Baseball Reference Porter was selected to the American League All-Star team in 1974. On December 6, 1976, the Milwaukee Brewers traded Porter along with Jim Colborn to the Kansas City Royals for Jamie Quirk, Jim Wohlford and Bob McClure. Porter replaced Buck Martinez as the Royals starting catcher. He had the best season of his career in 1979 when, he posted a .291 batting average along with 20 home runs, 112 runs batted in and led the league with 121 walks. He became only the sixth catcher in Major League history to score 100 runs and have 100 runs batted in.Darrell Porter Joins a Select Group of Catchers, Baseball Digest, January 1980, Vol. 39, No. 1, The feat had previously been accomplished by Mickey Cochrane, Yogi Berra, Roy Campanella, Johnny Bench, and Carlton Fisk\u2014all in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Only Porter and Cochrane had 100 walks, 100 runs, and 100 RBI in a single season. He ended the 1979 season ranked third in Wins Above Replacement behind Fred Lynn and his Royals teammate George Brett. With the Royals, he was selected to three consecutive American League All-Star teams. ====Drug problems==== Porter told the Associated Press that during the winter of 1979\u20131980, he became paranoid, and he was convinced that baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn\u2014who was known to be tough on drug use\u2014knew about his drug abuse. Porter said he believed that Kuhn was trying to sneak into his house and planned to ban him from baseball for life. Porter found himself sitting up at night in the dark watching out the front window, waiting for Kuhn to approach while clutching billiard balls and a shotgun. During spring training in 1980, former Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Don Newcombe paid a visit to the Kansas City clubhouse. He asked the players ten questions, the point of which being if a player answered three or more of the questions with an affirmation, the player might have a problem with drugs or alcohol. Porter affirmed all ten questions and checked himself into a rehabilitation center, admitting he had abused alcohol, cocaine, Quaaludes, and marijuana. ====Later career==== After checking into the rehab center, Porter became a born-again Christian, married, and became a spokesman for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. His production on the field declined after rehab, and he never again approached his 1979 levels. He went on to play in three World Series\u2014in 1980 with the Royals and in 1982 and 1985 with the St. Louis Cardinals. Porter won both the 1982 National League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award and the 1982 World Series MVP Award.Post-Season World Series MVP Awards & All- Star Game MVP Award Winners at Baseball Reference At the time, Porter was only the second player in baseball history to win both awards in a single postseason; Willie Stargell of the Pittsburgh Pirates won both awards in 1979.

He appeared in his final major league game on October 4, 1987 and retired at the age of 35. ==Career statistics== In a 17-year major league career, Porter played in 1,782 games, accumulating 1,369 hits in 5,539 at bats for a .247 career batting average along with 188 home runs, 826 runs batted in and a .354 on-base percentage.
