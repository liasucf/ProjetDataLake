He graduated from Elizabethtown High School in June 1943. During his final year of high school, he was a page in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from January to May 1943. Robert Reem married Donna Z. Mayo He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in August 1943, completed his recruit training at Parris Island, South Carolina, in October and was selected for appointment to the Naval Academy at that time. He attended the Naval Academy Preparatory School at the Naval Training Center, Bainbridge, Maryland, before entering the Academy in June 1944. He was commissioned a Marine Corps second lieutenant on June 4, 1948, upon his graduation from Annapolis. In June 1949, he completed the Basic School at Quantico, Virginia, where he remained with the Special Training Regiment until that August. In December 1949, after several months at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, with the 3rd Battalion, 6th Marines, 2nd Marine Division, he was assigned with that battalion to duty with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. In August 1950, the battalion was ordered to Korea, where it joined the 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division. 2Lt Reem fought with his battalion in the Inchon landing, the capture of Seoul and the advance to the Chosin Reservoir. The 26-year-old Marine was commanding an infantry platoon near Chinhung-ni, North Korea, on November 6, 1950. He was preparing his men for an assault on an enemy position when the grenade landed among them. Without hesitation, he smothered the grenade's explosion with his own body to save the rest of the group from death or serious injury. For this action, he was awarded the Medal of Honor. The Medal of Honor was presented to his widow by Secretary of the Navy Dan A. Kimball in ceremonies on February 8, 1952 in Washington, D.C. He initially was buried in the United Nations Cemetery near Hamhung, North Korea. His body was later returned to the United States for burial in Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Virginia. His grave can be found in section 6, Grave 9376-B, Map Grid X/18. As of 2010, he was the only NAPS graduate and, along with Baldomero Lopez, the latest graduates of the Naval Academy to receive a Medal of Honor. (Admiral Stockdale received one for Vietnam War service, but was a 1946 graduate.) Reem is memorialized at the US Naval Academy with a special dormitory room, the Reem room, with brass plaque. ==Awards and decorations== 2LT Reem's awards include: {| |- | | | |- | | | |- |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |Medal of Honor |Purple Heart |Presidential Unit Citation with 1 bronze star |- |American Campaign Medal |World War II Victory Medal |Korean Service Medal with 2 bronze stars |- |} ==Medal of Honor citation== The President of the United States takes pride in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR posthumously to SECOND LIEUTENANT ROBERT D.
