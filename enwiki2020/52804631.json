    "text": "Le Phare de Qu\u00e9bec (English: The Quebec Lighthouse) is an approved project located on Laurier boulevard in Sainte-Foy\u2013Sillery\u2013Cap-Rouge, a borough of Quebec City. The complex consists of 4 towers: Tour 1 at 250 metres and 65 floors, Tour 2 at 180 metres and 50 floors, Tour 3 at 110 metres and 30 floors, and Tour 4 at 60 metres and 17 floors. Tour 1 would become the tallest building in Quebec and the tallest building in Canada east of Toronto. The 25,083 square-metre site sits on the former location of Hotel Governors, which was demolished in 2013. The total floor area of the complex will be more than 186,000 square metres, consisting primarily of office, commercial, residential, and hotel space. The complex will also feature a 750-seat multimedia concert hall. The construction of the complex has been controversial for the city's residents. Concerns include aesthetics, increased local wind speeds, and unfair competition with buildings in neighbouring boroughs due to the building's large floor space. ==See also== *List of tallest buildings in Quebec City *List of tallest buildings in Quebec ==References== ==External links== *Redevelopment plans for Sainte-Foy specific to the Le Phare project; Ville du Quebec * Category:Proposed buildings and structures in Canada Category:Proposed skyscrapers in Canada Category:Buildings and structures in Quebec City ",
