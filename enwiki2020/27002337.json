    "text": "In quantum field theory, a Slavnov\u2013Taylor identity is the non-Abelian generalisation of a Ward\u2013Takahashi identity, which in turn is an identity between correlation functions that follows from the global or gauged symmetries of a theory, and which remains valid after renormalization. The identity was originally discovered by Gerard 't Hooft , and it is named after Andrei Slavnov and John C. Taylor who rephrased the identity to hold off the mass shell. . ==References== == External links == * Slavnov-Taylor identities Category:Quantum field theory ",
