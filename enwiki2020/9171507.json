In June 2003, while he was 17 years old, Aleksandrov signed with Chernomorets Burgas and made his debut in the A Group. In the summer of 2005, due to the big financial crisis at the club, he was released and several weeks later he accepted the offer from Cherno More Varna. === Cherno More === Aleksandrov made his league debut for Cherno More on 17 September 2005, appearing as a substitute in a 4\u20130 home win against Belasitsa Petrich.

On 5 April 2011, Aleksandrov was sent off against CSKA Sofia in a 2\u20130 defeat of the Bulgarian Cup, his first red card in a Cherno More shirt. Two weeks later, he signed a two-year contract extension, keeping him at Cherno More until 2013. === Ludogorets Razgrad === Aleksandrov signed with Bulgarian champions Ludogorets Razgrad in January 2014 and made his first A Group appearance for the team on 30 March 2014, playing the full 90 minutes in the 1\u20131 home draw against Botev Plovdiv. === Return to Cherno More === On 18 June 2017, Aleksandrov was announced as Cherno More's new signing.

In March, 2008, the Bulgarian national coach Plamen Markov called Aleksandar in the Bulgaria national football team for the friendly match with Finland. Lyuboslav Penev gave him his debut on 30 May 2013 in an away friendly against Japan when Aleksandar came on as a substitute for the injured Iliya Milanov.
