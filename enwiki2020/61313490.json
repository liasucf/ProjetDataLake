According to Gregory, Rozwell Kid was a substantial influence on much of his early songwriting. The band's name is derived from a game that Gregory played with the band's \"merch guy\" at recess in elementary school.https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/cg17nz/my_name_is_kornie_boi_from_prince_daddy_the_hyena/eudvwnf?utm_source=share&utm;_medium=web2x&context;=3 Prince Daddy & The Hyena began in 2015 with the release of an extended play titled Adult Summers.
