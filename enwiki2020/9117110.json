    "text": "Nair is a hair-removal product manufactured by Church & Dwight. It was purchased from Carter-Wallace in 2001 via a partnership with Kelso. Also in 2001 Nair introduced its line of men's products. The brand is mainly known for its depilatories that work by breaking the disulfide bonds of the keratin molecules in hair. This reduces the tensile strength of the keratin so greatly that the hair can be wiped away. Nair's slogans include: \"The Less That You Wear the less you have to fix your hair, the More You Need Nair!\"; \"Like Never Before\"; and \"We wear short shorts, Nair for short shorts\". The initial ad for the \"short shorts\" commercial won a Clio. It was based on the 1958 song \"Short Shorts\". Nair is a portmanteau of \"No hair.\" As of 2007, Nair had 25 products ranging from hair removal waxes to bleaches. ==Active ingredients== Calcium hydroxide is an active ingredient that chemically breaks down the hair for removal. Earlier products used sodium hydroxide (lye), which could cause chemical burns. Some formulations also contain potassium thioglycolate, which breaks down the bonds in the hair's keratin. The products often include softening agents, such as mineral oil, to help offset the harsh active ingredients. ==References== ==External links== * Nair * Nair for Men Category:Hair removal Category:Church & Dwight brands Category:Personal care brands Category:Carter-Wallace Category:Products introduced in 2001 ",
