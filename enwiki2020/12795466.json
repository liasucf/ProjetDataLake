    "text": "Mitch Silpa (born January 9, 1973) is an American writer, actor and director, who starred in NBC's The Rerun Show, and has appearances in shows such as Brothers & Sisters, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Desperate Housewives, Gilmore Girls, I'm with Her, One on One, Kitchen Confidential, Reno 911!, and Joey. ==Life and career== Silpa was born in Los Angeles, California. He is a member of The Groundlings, an improv and sketch comedy troupe based in Los Angeles. Silpa is perhaps best known on the Internet for his David Blaine street magic parodies. In these parodies, Silpa masquerades as an intentionally low-quality likeness of the world-renowned magician. Actors Mikey Day and Michael Naughton also appear in these parodies, as best friends Evan and Peter whom Silpa terrorizes with his \"magic\". Silpa has had small roles in sitcoms such as 2 Broke Girls, and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Although known for a more mature sense of humor, Silpa also acts in television shows that are for a younger audience such as I'm In the Band on Disney XD and iCarly on Nickelodeon. Silpa also plays more serious roles like the character Deputy Everhardt in the television drama, In Plain Sight. As for big screen appearances, one of Silpa's more notable characters is a flight attendant named Steve in the 2011 comedy film, Bridesmaids. He has been working on the pilot for a new Fox show titled Just Posted. Silpa is a co-executive producer for the show, but also took part in writing the script and acting in the first episode. Another one of his reoccurring projects that is outside of television and film is with The Groundlings as he performs with other cast troupe members in a show entitled Cookin' with Gas. In this show the members take suggestions from the audience which changes every week and create songs and sketches based on these ideas. == References == == External Links == * Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:American male television actors Category:Male actors from Los Angeles Category:21st-century American male actors Category:American male film actors ",
