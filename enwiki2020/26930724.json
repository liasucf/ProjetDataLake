    "text": "The Hotel Ross is an old hotel in the Chilean city of Pichilemu. It was created by Agust\u00edn Ross Edwards in 1885, and remodeled in December 1987. The park is located on Agust\u00edn Ross Avenue, in front of the old Ross Casino. The hotel was originally named Great Hotel Pichilemu (). The once grand Ross Hotel was constructed at the same time. Although the hotel, one of the oldest in Chile, is still partially open to guests, it is in a high state of disrepair. It is a National Monument of Chile, as part of the Sector de Pichilemu typical zone. ==See also== *Agust\u00edn Ross Cultural Center *Agust\u00edn Ross Park ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Hotels in Chile Category:Buildings and structures in Pichilemu Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1885 Category:Organizations based in Pichilemu ",
