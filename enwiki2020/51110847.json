After a stay in Warsaw at the court of John III Sobieski, he returned to the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise 21 March 1702 and was received 18 October. Disgraced by nature, he one day harangued the audience by throwing \"Gentlemen, it is easier for you to accustom yourself to my face, that for me to change it.\" If he never gave up the stage (he even played the role of Ma\u00eetre Robert in his last play Les Amazones modernes in 1727, written in collaboration with Louis Fuzelier), he devoted part of his time to writing theater plays (forty in all), sometimes to the Com\u00e9die fran\u00e7aise, sometimes to the Comedie Italienne, and once even for a Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la foire, the op\u00e9ra comique, Les Animaux raisonnables, 1717. Le Roi de Cocagne (1718) is usually considered to be his masterpiece. While he was composing the play Cartouche ou les voleurs (1721), he pushed the sake of realism as far as visiting in prison the famous brigand to document the argot.Claudine N\u00e9d\u00e9lec, \"Marc-Antoine Legrand : Cartouche, ou les Voleurs (1721) : analyse et \u00e9tude de l\u2019argot\", in Les dossiers du Grihl == References == == Bibliography == === Studies on Legrand === * Burnet, Mary Scott, Marc-Antoine Legrand, acteur et auteur comique, Paris, Droz, 1938. * Lauro, Carlo, 'Foire' et utopia nel teatro di M.-A.
