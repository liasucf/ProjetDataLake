    "text": "is an anime series that aired from 1983 to 1984 in Japan, Latin America, Spain and Italy. There were 45 episodes aired at 25 minutes each. Other loosely translated names are \"Arbegas\", \"Arebegas\", \"Lightspeed ElectroGod Arbegas\" and \"Arbegas: El Rayo Custodio\". ==Original story== Three talented students of a technical high school, Daisaku, Tetsuya, and Hotaru, create award-winning robots as part of a school competition. At this time, the evil Derinja race that plans control of all space extends its ambitions to Earth. To combat this threat, Hotaru's father, Professor Mizuki, takes the three robots and modifies them for battle. Albegas, a super robot, is born. ==Concept== The three individual robots form by stacking on top of one another to form a super robot called Albegas. There are six stackable formations. Each one serves a special function. Individually, the name of the robots are derived from the first 3 letters of the Greek alphabet (Alpha, Beta, and Gamma). Albegas' weapon of choice is the Sanbai Plasma Sword, with which he defeats enemy Derinja robots (called \"Mecha-Fighters\") by splitting them in half. Each robot also uses an individual sword. ==Staff== * Director Kozo Morishita * Additional Directors Masamitsu Sasaki Masao Ito Noriyasu Yamauchi Keiji Hisaoka Takao Yoshisawa Masayuki Akehi * Screen Writers Akiyoshi Sakai * Designers Shigenori Kageyama Koichi Ohata * Animation Hajie Kaneko Toshio Mori * Music Michiaki Watanabe ==Characters== ===Albegas members=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Their giant robots, called \"Mecha-Fighters\" and often prefixed with \"Mecha-\", act as monsters of the week. A few are piloted, and the pilot is usually killed when Albegas splits their Mecha-Fighter in half. Duston (in Episode 27), Azass (Episode 29) and Bios (Episode 45) suffer this fate as well, while Dari (Episode 44) is badly hurt but taken prisoner by the Albegas staff, dying later in their headquarters. All remaining Derinja (as well as Bios' second orbital base/mothership) are dematerialized in Episode 45 when Albegas destroys Grand Deram and makes the Deram planet explode. {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !

The three aircraft could also combine into a single jet called the Super Abega. They were very quickly replaced by a different set of small aircraft that could transform into different bipedal droid forms, and similarly combined into the New Super Abega. {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !

However, die-cast Albegas toys were still released as \"Voltron II (a.k.a., \"Gladiator Voltron\") in the Matchbox Voltron toyline, and Albegas made a brief appearance as Gladiator Voltron in the Voltron comic book series. ==Unreleased Arcade Game== Albegas was intended to become a laserdisc arcade game to be produced by Sega, with Toei Animation to produce the animation for it. It was going to be published by Bally Midway for the U.S. under the title of Cybernault and a prototype video was made to demonstrate what the game would be like. However the release of the game was cancelled. Prior to its cancellation, Japanese magazine Game Machine listed Albegas on their July 1, 1984 issue as being the most-successful upright arcade unit of the year. ==References== ==External links== * * Atari HQ * System 16 * Collection dx Category:1983 anime television series Category:Super robot anime and manga Category:TV Tokyo original programming Category:Voltron Category:Toei Animation television ",
