Charri\u00e8re was sentenced to serve time in a maximum security prison on Devil's Island in French Guiana. He and several inmates managed to escape from French Guiana to Brazil and settled in the area of present-day Normandia. While Charri\u00e8re left the settlement after four or five years, other inmates became permanent residents. The Municipality of Normandia (Municipio de Normandia) was created by Federal Law No. 7,009 of July 1982, with land separated from the state capital of Boa Vista. ==Lake Caracaran\u00e3== Lake Caracaran\u00e3, located in Normandia, is one of the tourist destinations of the state of Roriama.
