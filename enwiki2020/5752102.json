    "text": "The Empty Mask (1928) is a painting by Belgian surrealist Ren\u00e9 Magritte. In his essay Words and Images, published in 1929, Magritte observed that each image \"suggests that there are others behind it\". Viewed through a freestanding frame of irregular shape, these images are a sky, a lead curtain festooned with sleigh bells, a house fa\u00e7ade, a sheet of paper cut-outs, a forest and a fire. The title evokes the fear of the invisible which pervades the artist's work and reflects the surrealists' fascination with the subconscious. The painting was purchased in 1973 and is usually on display in the National Museum of Wales. ==Sources== *National Museum Wales Category:Paintings by Ren\u00e9 Magritte Category:Surrealist paintings Category:1928 paintings Category:Paintings of the National Museum Cardiff ",
