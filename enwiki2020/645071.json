    "text": "The Kingdom (Danish title: Riget) is an eight-episode Danish television mini- series, created by Lars von Trier in 1994, and co-directed by Lars von Trier and Morten Arnfred. It has been edited together into a five-hour film for distribution in the United Kingdom and United States. The series is set in the neurosurgical ward of Copenhagen's Rigshospitalet, the city and country's main hospital, nicknamed \"Riget\". \"Riget\" means \"the realm\" or \"the kingdom\", and leads one to think of \"d\u00f8dsriget\", the realm of the dead. The show follows a number of characters, both staff and patients, as they encounter bizarre phenomena, both human and supernatural. The show is notable for its wry humor, its muted sepia colour scheme, and the appearance of a chorus of dishwashers with Down syndrome who discuss in intimate detail the strange occurrences in the hospital. The first quartet of episodes ended with numerous questions unanswered, and in 1997, the cast reassembled to produce another group of four episodes, Riget II (The Kingdom II). This second series ended with even more questions unanswered than the first, and a third series was planned. However, due to the death in 1998 of Ernst-Hugo J\u00e4reg\u00e5rd (who played Stig Helmer) and the subsequent death of Kirsten Rolffes (who played Mrs Drusse) in 2000, the likelihood of a third series is now very remote. Von Trier actually wrote the third and final season, but the production was not picked up by DR. At that point, five regular cast members had died and it seemed impossible to continue the series. The abandoned scripts were sent to the producers of Stephen King's Kingdom Hospital, but it is unclear whether they used the scripts or not. Despite being a mini-series, The Kingdom appears as one of the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Von Trier has credited Twin Peaks and the 1965 French miniseries Belphegor as inspirations. ==Plot== Each episode of Riget and Riget II begins with the same prologue, detailing how the hospital, Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, was built on the site of the \"bleaching ponds\", which recur in the name of the street of the hospital's official address, Blegdamsvej, although the exact significance of the reference is never explicitly discussed in the series. The show begins with the admission of a spiritualist patient, Sigrid Drusse, who hears the sound of a girl crying in the elevator shaft. Upon investigation, Drusse discovers that the girl had died decades earlier, having been killed by her father to hide her illegitimacy. In order to put the spirit to rest, Drusse searches for the girl's body and ultimately finds it preserved in a specimen jar in the office of the hospital's professor of pathology, Professor Bondo (Baard Owe). Meanwhile, neurosurgeon Stig Helmer, a recent appointee from Sweden to the neurosurgery department, tries to cover up his responsibility for a botched operation which left a young girl in a persistent vegetative state. Pathologist Dr. Bondo attempts to convince the family of a man dying from liver cancer to donate his liver to the hospital for Bondo's research. (In fact, Bondo wants it as a trophy, as it is the second largest hepatosarcoma ever recorded.) When his request is denied, Bondo has the cancerous liver transplanted into his own body (as the patient signed an organ donor form), so that the cancer will become his personal property and can be kept within the hospital. Amongst other plotlines, a young medical student becomes attracted to the nurse in charge of the sleep research laboratory, a ghostly ambulance appears and disappears every night, a junior doctor runs a black market in medical supplies, and a neurosurgeon discovers that she was impregnated by a ghost and that the baby in her womb is developing abnormally rapidly. In every episode, two dishwashers (each with Down syndrome) in the cellar discuss the strange happenings at Riget, and Stig Helmer screams his famous catchphrase: Danskj\u00e4vlar (subtitled as \"Danish scum\", but literally \"Danish devils\"). ==Cast== *Ernst-Hugo J\u00e4reg\u00e5rd \u2013 Stig Helmer *Kirsten Rolffes \u2013 Sigrid Drusse *Holger Juul Hansen \u2013 Einar Moesgaard *S\u00f8ren Pilmark \u2013 J\u00f8rgen 'Hook' Krogsh\u00f8j *Ghita N\u00f8rby \u2013 Rigmor Mortensen *Jens Okking \u2013 Bulder Harly Drusse *Otto Brandenburg \u2013 Hansen *Annevig Schelde Ebbe \u2013 Mary Kr\u00fcger *Baard Owe \u2013 Palle Bondo *Birgitte Raaberg \u2013 Judith Petersen *Peter Mygind \u2013 Morten 'Mogge' Moesgaard *Vita Jensen \u2013 Female dishwasher *Morten Rotne Leffers \u2013 Male dishwasher *Solbj\u00f8rg H\u00f8jfeldt \u2013 Camilla *Udo Kier \u2013 \u00c5ge Kr\u00fcger / Little Brother *Birthe Neumann \u2013 Secretary to Moesgaard, later to Helmer *Erik Weders\u00f8e \u2013 Ole *John Hahn-Petersen \u2013 Secretary Nivesen *Henning Jensen \u2013 Director Bob *Louise Fribo \u2013 Sanne Jeppesen *Laura Christensen \u2013 Mona Jensen *Vera Gebuhr \u2013 Gerda *Ole Boisen \u2013 Christian *Nis Bank-Mikkelsen \u2013 Priest *Thomas Bo Larsen \u2013 The Falcon *Henrik Koefoed \u2013 Radiologist *Poul H\u00fcttel \u2013 Steenb\u00e6k *Helle Virkner \u2013 Emma Mogensen *Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd \u2013 The Swedish lawyer ==Episodes== ===Riget=== *Day 1: \"Den hvide flok\" / \"The Unheavenly Host\" *Day 2: \"Alliancen kalder\" / \"Thy Kingdom Come\" *Day 3: \"Et fremmed legeme\" / \"A Foreign Body\" *Day 4: \"De levende d\u00f8de\" / \"The Living Dead\" ===Riget II=== *Day 5: \"Mors in Tabula\" / \"Death on the Operation Table\" *Day 6: \"Tr\u00e6kfuglene\" / \"Birds of Passage\" *Day 7: \"Gargantua\" *Day 8: \"Pand\u00e6monium\" ==Release== ===Home media=== The film is currently available on DVD in Australia and New Zealand on Madman Entertainment's Directors Suite label, in the UK from Second Sight, and in the United States from Koch-Lorber Films ==Reception== ===Critical reception=== Critical reception for The Kingdom has been mostly positive, with many critics praising its atmosphere and direction. Film critic Leonard Maltin, who reviewed the two-part theatrical version, awarded it three and a half out of a possible four stars, calling it \"a must-see for those who think they've seen everything\". In the best-selling book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, the film is called \"a medical horror epic\", with its supernatural elements described as being both eerie and magical. ===Awards=== *1995 \u2013 Bodil Award \u2013 Best Actor (Ernst-Hugo J\u00e4reg\u00e5rd), Best Actress (Kirsten Rolffes), Best Supporting Actor (Holger Juul Hansen), Best Film (Lars Von Trier) *1995 \u2013 30th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival \u2013 the film was nominated for the Crystal Globe and won the Best Director Award (Lars von Trier), and the Best Actor Award (Ernst-Hugo J\u00e4reg\u00e5rd) *1995 \u2013 Robert Award \u2013 Best Actor (Ernst- Hugo J\u00e4reg\u00e5rd), Best Actress (Kirsten Rolffes), Best Cinematography (Eric Kress), Best Original Score (Joachim Holbek), Best Screenplay (Lars von Trier, Niels V\u00f8rsel), Best Sound (Per Streit) *1995 \u2013 Seattle International Film Festival - Golden Space Needle Award for Best Film *1996 \u2013 Adolf Grimme Award \u2013 Series/Miniseries (Lars von Trier) *1996 \u2013 Golden Cable \u2013 Bronze Cable for Innovation (Lars von Trier) ==Remake== American horror writer Stephen King developed a 13-episode mini-series based on Riget, under the title Stephen King's Kingdom Hospital, which was broadcast in 2004. The plot retained many of the elements of Riget, transferring the location of the hospital to Lewiston, Maine and placing it on the site of a mill built before the Civil War. Many of the characters derived their names from the Danish original (e.g., Sigrid Drusse became Sally Druse and Stig Helmer became Dr. Stegman). A significant difference in the American series was the introduction of a talking giant anteater character in the role of spirit guide/death/Anubis/Antubis. ==See also== *List of ghost films ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1994 Danish television series debuts Category:1997 Danish television series endings Category:1994 horror films Category:Horror fiction television series Category:DR television dramas Category:Danish drama television series Category:Down syndrome in television Category:Television series by Entertainment One Category:Health in Denmark Category:1990s Danish television series Category:Zentropa films Category:1994 films Category:Lars von Trier Category:Danish-language television shows ",
