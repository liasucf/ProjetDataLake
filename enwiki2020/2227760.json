    "text": "Artigas Department (, ) is the northernmost department of Uruguay, located in its northwestern region. Its capital is the city of Artigas, which borders on the Brazilian city of Quara\u00ed. Artigas Department has an area of , making it the fifth largest in the country. The population is 73,378 inhabitants, according to the 2011 census. It is bordered on the north and east by Brazil, from which it is separated by the Cuareim River. To the south, Artigas Department borders on Salto Department, and to the west is Argentina, from which it is separated by the Uruguay River. Artigas is the only Uruguayan department that borders two other countries. The department and its capital city are named after Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas (1764\u20131850), leader of the Orientales (inhabitants of the Banda Oriental, the Eastern bank of the Uruguay River) during Uruguay's wars of independence. ==History== Owner region of a prehistoric past which later became \"no man's land\" between the Spanish and Portuguese empires. The initial indigenous predominance (chan\u00e1s-charr\u00faas- Guarani) was displaced by the native settlement and subsequent colonies of immigrants. Artigas department was created by law on 1 October 1884, on territory previously belonged to the department of Salto; from that date it is designated to Villa de San Eugenio as capital, which in 1915 passed to the category of city with the name of Artigas, capital of the department with the same name in tribute to the national hero of Uruguay Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas. He was linked to the fact Colonel Carlos Lecueder, first politician and police chief Artigas. Sacred Heart Church Its capital Artigas comes at the end of the \"Guerra Grande\" in order to consolidate the borders with Brazil, with the name of San Eugenio del Cuareim. It was founded on September 12, 1852 by Don Carlos Catala, choosing as the best site located on the banks of the Cuareim River opposite the Villa San Juan Bautista on the other side of the river, which was a military settlement that was then transformed into what is today the city of Quara\u00ed. With the name of Santa Rosa del Cuareim was founded the current Bella Union by Fructuoso Rivera and refugees Guarani after the campaign Eastern Missions against Brazil in 1829. In 1852 after winning the allies Colorados Brazil national, territory north of Cuareim was yielded to Brazil which prompted an evacuation of the population. It was refounded in 1853 under the name of Santa Rosa de la Bella Union Quareim. In 1929 the national government to mark the centenary of the campaign of Missions, sent a bill to the Senate, which established the name Bella Union, which for that time was a villa . ==Geography and climate== Topographic map of Artigas Department showing main populated places and roads Two portions of the department's border with Brazil are disputed (Isla Brasilera or Brazilian Island near Bella Uni\u00f3n, and an area called Rinc\u00f3n de Artigas near Masoller), but unlike many border disputes between Latin American countries, this issue has not strained Uruguay's relations with Brazil, which remain friendly. Two main geostructural regions can be found inside Artigas' limits: *The central and eastern area, which includes a basaltic cuesta, and some sedimentary plains near the Cuareim River. Also found in the region are some hill ranges, such as Cuchilla de Bel\u00e9n. *The western area, which consists of a narrow alluvial plain. Artigas Department's average temperature is the highest in the whole country (over 19\u00b0C or 66\u00b0F, and may go as high as 47\u00b0C or 116\u00b0F during the summer months). So are its precipitation levels (up to an annual average of 1400 mm). ==Economy== Plantations in Bella Uni\u00f3n, north of Artigas. The unique climatic conditions of Artigas has made possible the development of an important agro-industrial centre around the city of Bella Uni\u00f3n. Several crops are planted, namely fruits and vegetables, sugar cane, and rice. In the rest of the department, the main economic activity is livestock raising. Semi- precious gemstones, such as agates and amethysts, are also found in the department, and an entire industry has risen up around their extraction and manufacturing, especially near the capital city of Artigas. The proximity of the department to Brazil has made it possible for an important flow of trade to be established here, but unfortunately this is generally unfavorable to Uruguayan economic interests. Nevertheless, this partially compensates for the fact that the per capita income is the lowest of the country, and the percentage of households in poverty is the highest in the country (13.19% of the inhabitants). ==Population and Demographics== A polished slice of an amethyst stalactite from Artigas Department As of the census of 2011, the Artigas Department had a population of 73,378 (36,079 male and 37,299 female) and 26,231 households.
