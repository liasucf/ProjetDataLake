The ch\u00e2teau, which has the air of an English Palladian house, with four Ionic columns under an arced pediment, raised upon a high rusticated basement, was owned by Pauline Bonaparte, Napoleon's sister and wife of General Charles Leclerc who employed Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9onard Fontaine to raise the house by adding an attic storeySee French Wikipedia: \"Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois- L\u00e9onard Fontaine\" and reference about 1798 and transformed the parterre into a terrace overlooking the park, which was re-landscaped in the naturalistic fashion, \u00e0 l'anglaise, with meadows and clumps of trees and specimens against a background of woodland.

The outbuildings were constructed before 1831, when they appear on an estate map. The pair of entrance pavilions date after 1835. In the early twentieth century the office of Achille Duch\u00eane reorganized the grand terrace: a semi-circular parterre was flanked by terraces connected by stairs. The ch\u00e2teau passed by inheritance to mar\u00e9chal Davout, then to the Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s and Suchet d'Albuf\u00e9ra families. Today the chateau belongs to the Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s and Suchet d'Albuf\u00e9ra families. Since 1974 it has housed a collection of wooden ware (\"treen\") and some 3000 different tools. ==Notes== ==External links== * The gardens and park *Patrimoine de France: Montgobert This article depends on architectural history presented here. chateaudemontgobert.com ==Further reading== *Comte Maxime de Sars, Montgobert et son ch\u00e2teau *\"Note sur la construction du ch\u00e2teau de Montgobert\", 'M\u00e9moires de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019Histoire et d\u2019Arch\u00e9ologie de l\u2019Aisne 12 (1966).
