    "text": "Snapped is an American true crime television series produced by Jupiter Entertainment. The series depicts high profile or bizarre cases of women accused of murder. Each episode outlines whether the motivation for murder was revenge against a cheating husband or lover, a large insurance payoff, or the ending to years of abuse, with each murder's circumstances as unique as the women profiled. Snapped premiered on August 6, 2004 on Oxygen. It has since become the network's longest-running original series, with its 24 defined seasons and fourteen years in production (and two spin-offs) outlasting the seventeen seasons and thirteen years of the Bad Girls Club. The show also played a large role in the decision by parent company NBCUniversal to relaunch Oxygen as a crime network in 2017. , 488 original episodes of Snapped have aired. ==Synopsis== The series features non-fiction narratives of people who have committed murder or attempted murder or have been accused of committing or attempting to commit murder. Often the target is the individual's spouse. The program is edited in a documentary style, using a central voice-over narration by actress Jody Flader, as well as interviews with people in possession of first-hand knowledge of the case, including law-enforcement officials, lawyers, journalists, friends and family members of both the victims and the accused, and at times the criminals or victims themselves. A few rare episodes during the series run have centered on male perpetrators, while a larger number of episodes have featured men who conspired with the central female perpetrator in the crime. ==Production== Snapped first aired on August 6, 2004, with the pilot episode, \"Celeste Beard Johnson\" The series is currently in its twenty-seventh season of production at Jupiter Entertainment. Actresses Laura San Giacomo and Ronnie Farer narrated the first and second seasons, respectively. Sharon Martin took the role of narrator in its third season, with a distinctive and pronounced oral cadence. She acquired an additional credit as a supervising producer of the series. In February 2018, Martin announced she would no longer narrate the series. The new narrator is actress Jody Flader, according to the end-of-episode credits and Flader's web site.
