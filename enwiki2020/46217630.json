It is run at Fairyhouse over a distance of 2 miles and 4 furlongs (4,023 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in April. The race was originally run at the course's Easte Festival but in 2017 it was moved to a fixture in early April to avoid clashing with similar races at the Punchestown Festival. The race was awarded Grade 2 status in 2004. ==Winners== {| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\" |- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\" ! style=\"width:36px\" | Year ! style=\"width:160px\" | Winner ! style=\"width:30px\" | Age ! style=\"width:180px\" | Jockey ! style=\"width:180px\" | Trainer |- | 1992 | Dee Ell | 6 | Tom Taaffe | Arthur Moore |- | 1993 | Belvederian | 6 | Charlie Swan | Mouse Morris |- | 1994 | Court Melody | 6 | Shane Broderick | Michael Hourigan |- | 1995 | Major Rumpus | 7 | F Woods | Arthur Moore |- | 1996 | Macallister | 6 | Richard Dunwoody | Victor Bowens |- | 1997 | Moscow Express | 5 | Charlie Swan | Aidan O'Brien |- | 1998 | Verrazano Bridge | 6 | Conor O'Dwyer | Tom Taaffe |- | 1999 | Winter Garden | 5 | Paul Carberry | Noel Meade |- | 2000 | Boley Lad | 6 | Paul Carberry | Noel Meade |- | 2001 | Risk Accessor | 6 | Charlie Swan | Christy Roche |- | 2002 | Thari | 5 | Paul Carberry | Noel Meade |- | 2003 | Pay It Forward | 5 | Timmy Murphy | Jessica Harrington |- | 2004 | Sadlers Wings | 6 | David Casey | Willie Mullins |- | 2005 | Sher Beau | 6 | David Casey | Philip Fenton |- | 2006 | Vic Venturi | 6 | Tony McCoy | Philip Fenton |- | 2007 | Aitmatov | 6 | Paul Carberry | Noel Meade |- | 2008 | Cooldine | 6 | Ruby Walsh | Willie Mullins |- | 2009 | Oscar Dan Dan | 7 | Ruby Walsh | Thomas Mullins |- | 2010 | Magnanimity | 6 | Davy Russell | Dessie Hughes |- | 2011 | Lambro | 6 | Emmet Mullins | Willie Mullins |- | 2012 | Jenari | 5 | Tony McCoy | Jessica Harrington |- | 2013 | Mala Beach | 5 | Davy Condon | Gordon Elliott |- | 2014 | Lieutenant Colonel | 5 | Benji O'Connell | Dessie Hughes |- | 2015 | Shaneshill | 6 | Ruby Walsh | Willie Mullins |- | 2016 | Acapella Bourgeois | 6 | Johnny Burke | Sandra Hughes |- | 2017 | Al Boum Photo | 5 | Paul Townend | Willie Mullins |- | 2018 | Pallasator | 9 | Davy Russell | Gordon Elliott |- | 2019 | Dommage Pour Toi | 6 | Rachael Blackmore | Henry de Bromhead |} ==See also== * Horse racing in Ireland * List of Irish National Hunt races ==References== *Racing Post: **, , , , ,, , , , **, , , , , , , , , **, , , , , , , Category:National Hunt races in Ireland Category:National Hunt hurdle races Category:Fairyhouse Racecourse ",
