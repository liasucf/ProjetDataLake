Shortly afterwards, his first album Paradoxes, along with his first single, Les Mots Bleus, were released, Paradoxes coming 3rd in the top 50 albums of its opening week. After three years, Thierry released his second album on the 20 November 2006, titled eponymously Thierry Amiel. The album gained 16th place in the top selling albums of France, with the single C\u0153ur Sacr\u00e9 peaking at 6th place in top singles. On 1 September 2007, Thierry competed in the Sopot Festival 2007 in Poland, representing France; his rivals were other music stars like: Sophie Ellis-Bextor, September, The Cloud Room and Monrose. He placed third. In 2010, Thierry was chosen to play the lead role of Adam, in the musical comedy, Adam et Eve, La Seconde Chance (Adam and Eve, the Second Chance), by Pascal Obispo.
