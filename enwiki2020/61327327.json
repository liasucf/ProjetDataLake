In 1989, election were held for the Mayor of Christchurch plus other local government positions. The polling was conducted using the standard first-past-the-post electoral method. ==Background== Sitting Mayor Hamish Hay retired and was succeeded by Labour Party councillor Vicki Buck who became Christchurch's first female mayor. There was deadlock on the city council with a four-way split in its membership. The Labour Party won a plurality of seats with eight seats, the United Citizens won seven, the new Christchurch Action ticket with six seats and the remaining three seats won by independent candidates.

Christchurch Action was set up, comprising former councillors from districts that merged with the city as part of the 1989 local government reforms. ==Results== The following table gives the election results: ==Ward results== Candidates were also elected from wards to the Christchurch City Council. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! !!
