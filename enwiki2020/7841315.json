She attended school in the Boise school system and after graduation from Boise High School, she enrolled at the College of Idaho in Caldwell, where, in chemistry class, she met Joe Albertson. They married on New Years Day in 1930. Together, they started the grocery store chain that bears their name (Albertsons). Kathryn was there for Joe and for their daughter, Barbara, as the store they created grew to be one of the largest supermarket chains in America. When Joe died in 1993, Kathryn remained active on the Albertson Corporation Board of Directors for several more years. In 1998, the company honored her by designating her Albertson\u2019s first Director Emeritus, an honorary lifetime position on the board of directors. ==J.A. and Kathryn Albertson Foundation== Kathryn and Joe believed strongly that \u201conce you make it, you need to give back.\u201d Together, they began to give to a number of charitable causes, often to help students who wanted to further their education. In 1966, they created the J.A. and Kathryn Albertson Foundation to help administer their personal giving. A walking park in Boise along the Boise River bears her name, a gift to the city from her husband in 1989. ==Death== Kathryn died at age 93 on April 30, 2002, and is interred next to her husband at Morris Hill Cemetery in Boise. ==References== ==External links== *J.A. & Kathryn Albertson Foundation *City of Boise: Kathryn Albertson Park *The College of Idaho - official website * Category:1908 births Category:2002 deaths Category:People from Boise, Idaho Category:College of Idaho alumni Category:Philanthropists from Idaho Category:American women philanthropists Category:20th-century philanthropists ",
