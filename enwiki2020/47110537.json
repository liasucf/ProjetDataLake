It is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, with a wide gable roof pierced by gabled dormers. A single-story porch wraps around the east and north sides, with brick posts and a dentil course in the eave. The main entrance is flanked by pilasters and sidelights, with a distinctive transom window that has semi-circular sections joined by a straight section. Built in 1906, it is one of the best-preserved examples of housing built in the city's most fashionable neighborhood of that period. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Pulaski County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1906 Category:Houses in North Little Rock, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Pulaski County, Arkansas Category:1906 establishments in Arkansas ",
