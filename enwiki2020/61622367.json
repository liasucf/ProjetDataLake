Johnny Sauter took the lead afterwards, but also lost it, to Sheldon Creed. The first caution occurred when Harrison Burton spun in the tri-oval. Creed maintained the lead and won Stage 1. Ross Chastain took the lead, but Tyler Dippel wrecked and brought out a caution. During stage 2, Moffitt and Friesen were found to be locking bumpers, causing NASCAR officials to force them to take a pass-through penalty. Both teams and some of the broadcasters disagreed with NASCAR\u2019s assessment. Stewart Friesen won Stage 2 after passing Brett Moffitt and Austin Hill. On lap 87, a large wreck occurred that took out Chastain after he turned across Creed's nose while trying to maintain his lead. In the final lap, Johnny Sauter held the lead until the tri-oval, where a block on Riley Herbst forced Herbst below the double yellow line. After NASCAR reviewed the footage, they deemed that Sauter's block caused Herbst to go below the yellow line. The race win was ultimately given to Boyd, while Sauter was demoted to 14th place. Chastain and Tyler Ankrum left the race below the cutoff point for the playoffs. Due to Boyd's win, none of the other playoffs drivers were locked into the final round. ===Stage Results=== Stage One Laps: 20 {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:98% |- ! Pos ! ! Driver !
