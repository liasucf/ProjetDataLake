From 1936 and 1945, it was known as Wyoming Highway 387. After 1945, the road was known as Wyoming Highway 59. U.S. Route 185 was commissioned in 1926 to run from Cheyenne to Orin. It was proposed that US 185 continue north to Gillette, via US 20 between Orin and Douglas, and via Wyoming Highway 59 between Douglas and Gillette. But the road now carrying WYO 59 did not exist. So when Highway 59 was constructed in the late 1920s and early 1930s, it carried the designation US 185. After the Great Recommissioning of 1936, Wyoming 185 was renumbered to Wyoming 387, since the route directly connected to the new U.S. 87, not U.S. 85. In 1945, the 387 designation was changed to WYO 59.Wyoming @ AARoads.com - Wyoming Highway 59 ==Major intersections== ==Wyoming Highway 59 Connector== Wyoming Highway 59 Connector is a long connector route of WYO 59 in Douglas.
