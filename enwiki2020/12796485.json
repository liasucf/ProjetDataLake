    "text": "Blind Dog at St. Dunstans is the seventh studio album by Canterbury Scene rock band Caravan. It was released in 1976. This album has a lighter feel than Caravan's previous releases, shifting toward shorter, \"poppier\" songs. The lighter feel is due in part to the prominence of Pye Hastings on the album. He wrote and sang eight out of nine songs. Moreover, Jan Schelhaas replaced Dave Sinclair on keyboards, moving away from lengthy organ-based instrumentals toward piano and synthesizer. ==Album cover and title== The cover art and title bring together several elements relating to Canterbury. St. Dunstan was Archbishop of Canterbury and patron saint of the blind, after whom a home for the blind was named. The title comes from a No\u00ebl Coward explanation to a child for why one dog had mounted another: one dog was blind and the other was pushing him to St. Dunstan's. At the end of the song \"Jack and Jill\", amongst dogs barking, two speaking voices can be heard: > First voice: \"What are those two doggies doing over there?\" Second voice > \"Well, the doggie in front is blind and his friend behind is pushing him all > the way to St Dunstan's\" The album cover shows St. Dunstan's Street leading to the old West Gate in Canterbury. Members of Caravan used to frequent the pubs near the St. Dunstan area. The cover notes gives special thanks to No\u00ebl Coward. ==Reception== AllMusic described it as \"'A major turn for the worse'\" and said the album was detrimental to Caravan's career. ==Track listing== All songs composed by Pye Hastings, except where noted. ;Side one ;Side two ==Personnel== ;Caravan * Pye Hastings \u2013 vocals (tracks 1, 3-9); electric and acoustic guitars * Geoffrey Richardson \u2013 viola, electric guitar, flute, night-shift whistle * Jan Schelhaas \u2013 keyboards * Mike Wedgwood \u2013 vocals (track 2); bass guitar, congas * Richard Coughlan \u2013 drums ;Additional personnel * Jimmy Hastings \u2013 flute, alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, clarinet * David Hitchcock \u2013 producer * Chanter Sisters \u2013 backing vocalist, backing vocals ;Credits * Lead vocals on all songs by Pye Hastings, except track 2, by Mike Wedgwood. * \"Here Am I\": lead guitar \u2013 Pye Hastings * \"A Very Smelly, Grubby Little Oik\": lead guitar \u2013 Geoffrey Richardson * \"Bobbing Wide\": flutes \u2013 Geoffrey Richardson * \"Come on Back\": lead guitar & flute \u2013 Geoffrey Richardson; tenor sax and clarinet \u2013 Jimmy Hastings * \"Oik (reprise)\": lead guitar & flute \u2013 Geoffrey Richardson; tenor sax and clarinet \u2013 Jimmy Hastings * \"Jack and Jill\": lead guitar \u2013 Pye Hastings * \"All the Way (with John Wayne's single-handed liberation of Paris)\": flute, alto sax \u2013 Jimmy Hastings ==Live recordings== Surprise Supplies (later renamed Here Am I) is a live album featuring all the Blind Dog at St. Dunstans songs, except for \"Jack and Jill\", recorded at a concert of 4 May 1976.
