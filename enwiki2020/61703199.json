    "text": "New Ideas () is a Salvadoran political party founded on August 21, 2018 and based in San Salvador. It was founded by the current President of the Republic of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele. It was legalized by the Supreme Electoral Court (TSE) on August 24, 2018. Its first secretary general was Federico Gerardo Anliker and was later succeeded by Xavier Zablah Bukele. It is defined, according to its statutes, as a \"democratic, decentralized, plural, and inclusive political party without obsolete ideologies, but at the forefront of the struggle for the recognition of all rights for all citizens, without exclusion or privileges. Among its principles are: building a free El Salvador, defending diversity of thought, a free market and social economy, assuming political activity and the exercise of power as an act of commitment to the country.\" ==History== === Foundation === After the then-Mayor of San Salvador Nayib Bukele was expelled on from the FMLN on 10 October 2017, he announced on 25 October through his social networks the foundation of a citizen movement called \"New Ideas\", seeking for it to become a political party and thus allowing him to compete in the 2019 presidential elections under its banner. Ultimately, this did not materialize, and Bukele ran a successful one-time campaign under the Grand Alliance for National Unity. By legal requirement, Bukele called on his supporters to go to the more than 90 signature collection centers throughout the country to support the creation of the political party. They managed to collect approximately 200,000 signatures in three days. ==Leaders== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! style=\"background :#449adf; color:white\"|1 (46) | Nayib Bukele || 80px || 1 June 2019 || 1 June 2024 || F\u00e9lix Ulloa |} ==References== == External links == * Website of Nuevas Ideas Category:Political parties in El Salvador Category:Political parties established in 2018 ",
