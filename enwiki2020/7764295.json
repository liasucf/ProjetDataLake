She did not compete in the 2006 and 2007 seasons, but improved on her personal best time in 800 metres in 2008. In the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Andrianova was 5th in the final, so in the 2005 World Championships she was a favourite. When she received a bronze medal, she regarded it as a defeat. \u201cI was so upset with that bronze,\u201d Andrianova says. \u201cI was already planning to get married and give birth to my child, and I was not sure I would be back on the track again. I was thinking probably it was my last World Championships. That\u2019s why, when the things went wrong from the very beginning, it made me so nervous\u201d.Maryanchik, Natalia (2008-08-05). Focus on Athletes - Tatyana Andrianova. IAAF. Retrieved on 2009-09-21. In 2006, she had her worst results but after the birth of her son Nikita, Andrianova began training as she was sure that her best results were about to come In the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, Andrianova was hoping for a medal as she so narrowly missed out in the 2004 Olympics, however, she was placed 8th in the finals. ==Achievements== {| |- !colspan=\"6\"|Representing |- |rowspan=3|2004 |World Indoor Championships |Budapest, Hungary |5th |800 m | |- |Olympic Games |Athens, Greece |5th |800 m | |- |World Athletics Final |Monte Carlo, Monaco |7th |800 m | |- |rowspan=2|2005 |World Championships |Helsinki, Finland |bgcolor=\"cc9966\" | 3rd |800 m | |- |World Athletics Final |Monte Carlo, Monaco |8th |800 m | |} ==Personal bests== *800 metres - 1:56.00 min (2008) *1500 metres - 4:12.02 min (2005) ==Doping suspension== The IAAF reported in December 2015 that Andrianova would be retroactively suspended for testing positive for the performance-enhancing drug stanozolol. The test invalidated her results from August 9, 2005 through August 8, 2007. On April 14, 2016 the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has overturned an Andrianova's two-year doping suspension because her sample was retested beyond the eight-year statute of limitations. \"As the eight-year statute of limitations had expired prior to January 1, 2015, the 10-year statute of limitations provided under the new 2015 anti-doping rules cannot apply,\" CAS said in a statement. ==References== ==External links== * * Photographs at sportphoto.ru Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Russian female middle- distance runners Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic athletes of Russia Category:Sportspeople from Yaroslavl Category:World Athletics Championships medalists ",
