    "text": "Beginning of a recitative (St Matthew Passion, No. 61), the Bible words written in red The Evangelist in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach is the tenor part in his oratorios and Passions who narrates the exact words of the Bible, translated by Martin Luther, in recitative secco. The part appears in the works St John Passion, St Matthew Passion, and the Christmas Oratorio, as well as the St Mark Passion and the Ascension Oratorio Lobet Gott in seinen Reichen, BWV 11. Some cantatas also contain recitatives of Bible quotations, assigned to the tenor voice. Bach followed a tradition using the tenor for the narrator of a gospel. It exists (and is also often called the Evangelist) in earlier works setting biblical narration, for example by Heinrich Sch\u00fctz (Weinachtshistorie, Matth\u00e4uspassion, Lukaspassion, Johannespassion). In contrast, the vox Christi, voice of Christ, is always the bass in Bach's works, including several cantatas. == Music and sources == The Evangelist reports in secco recitatives accompanied by basso continuo only. In the St John Passion the story consists of chapters 18 and 19 of John the Evangelist, the St Matthew Passion tells the complete chapters 26 and 27 of Matthew the Evangelist. The first versions of the St. John Passion contained two additional lines from Matthew mentioning the weeping of the disciple Peter and the tearing of the temple curtain. Bach composed the weeping in an expressive melisma and the tearing in a forceful downward run followed by tremolo, but removed the parts in later versions. The Christmas Oratorio follows Luke the Evangelist for parts 1 to 4, and St. Matthew for Parts 5 and 6. A St Mark Passion after Mark the Evangelist is lost, but has been reconstructed by several scholars. In the Ascension Oratorio the story is compiled verse by verse from different biblical sources. The Easter Oratorio is an exception, as a play of four biblical characters without narration.Alfred D\u00fcrr. 1971. \"Die Kantaten von Johann Sebastian Bach\", B\u00e4renreiter 1999, (in German) ==Evangelist singers== Some tenors are known especially for their rendition of the Evangelist, including: * Theo Altmeyer * Gervase Elwes * Karl Erb, mentioned in Thomas Mann's novel Doctor Faustus as Erbe (in English: Heritage) * Kurt Equiluz * John van Kesteren * Peter Pears * Christoph Pr\u00e9gardien * Peter Schreier * James Taylor * Steuart Wilson == Evangelist in cantatas == The Evangelist narrates in several cantatas.

The tenor as the Evangelist begins the narration from the verse 31, ' (Jesus gathered the twelve to Himself). The bass as the vox Christi (voice of Christ) sings the announcement of the suffering, ' (Behold, we go up to Jerusalem), A choral fugue illustrates the reaction of the disciples. In Am Abend aber desselbigen Sabbats, BWV 42 (8 April 1725, first Sunday after Easter), the tenor opens after a Sinfonia, accompanied by the continuo in repeated fast notes, possibly illustrating the anxious heart beat of the disciples, when Jesus appears, \"On the evening, however, of the same Sabbath, when the disciples had gathered and the door was locked out of fear of the Jews, Jesus came and walked among them\", . In Er rufet seinen Schafen mit Namen, BWV 175 (22 May 1725, Pentecost Tuesday), the tenor sings the opening recitative, \"Er rufet seinen Schafen mit Namen und f\u00fchret sie hinaus\", .
