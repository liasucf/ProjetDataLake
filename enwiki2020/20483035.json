He was the son of Johann Nicolaus Stupanus (1542\u20131621), Professor of Theoretical Medicine at the University of Basel, and his second wife, Katharina Iselin. He was married to Judith Z\u00f6rnlin; one of his granddaughters, Judith Stupanus, was to become the wife of Jacob Bernoulli. Stupanus completed his Gymnasium education in 1603. The next year he was sent to the University of Geneva, where he studied philosophy under Esa\u00efe Colladon and Gaspard Laurent. In 1607 he returned to Basel, having first privately defended the Baccalaureus and later publicly the A.L.M. degree. He continued to study medicine, following the lectures of his father, and Gaspard Bauhin and Felix Plater. After visiting well-known Universities in Germany, France and Italy he was awarded the degree of Medical Doctor from Basel under Petrus Ryff, in 1613. He also took classes in Ancient Greek from Jacob Zwinger, philosophy from Heinrich Justus, and rhetoric from Friedrich Castellio.
