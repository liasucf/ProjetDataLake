    "text": "Symphorce was a German progressive power metal band, originally assembled in 1998. == History == The band was formed in October 1998 by singer Andy B. Franck. He created the name Symphorce as a play of words, a portmanteau of symphony and force. It was a few months later, in 1999 that they released their first album Truth to Promises on Noise Records. The release had them touring as support act for Mercyful Fate. After this first tour, a big step happened in the history of the band, when Andy had to replace two bandmembers. It was the arrival of guitarist C\u00e9dric \"Cede\" Dupont and bassist Dennis Wohlbold, that gave the band an entire new sound. A year later, in 2000, their combined songwriting resulted in the second album Sinctuary. It led to the band being quoted as one of the most promising acts in Germany at the time. Andy began to combine Symphorce with singing in the band Brainstorm at the same time. Two years later, C\u00e9dric \"Cede\" Dupont joined the band Freedom Call on top of his part in Symphorce, and two new members have given the band a complete new energy. Sasha Sauer on drums and Markus Pohl on second guitars give the others more breathing space, and in 2002 the new album phorcefulAhead is released, now on Metal Blade, their new label. In 2005, the guitarist Markus Pohl joined Mystic Prophecy as a full-time member, after previously just been a touring member. Drummer Sascha Sauer left in 2005 after a tour of Europe and the United States. On September 2, 2006, it was announced that his replacement was Steffen Theurer. In 2009, Symphorce began work on a new album. C\u00e9dric \"Cede\" Dupont had an interview on Dave Softee's Meltdown on Metal Messiah Radio on February 17, 2009 informing about new plans for Symphorce and his new formed band Downspirit. The band released their current album, Unrestricted, on October 15, 2010 via AFM Records. On October 10, 2011, vocalist Andy B. Franck announced that Symphorce had disbanded.
