    "text": "Lars Gustav Gabriel Hollmer (21 July 1948 \u2013 25 December 2008) was a Swedish accordionist, keyboardist and composer, whose work drew on music ranging from Nordic folk tunes to progressive rock. He has been a member and/or founder of over half a dozen groups, most of whose work has been recorded at The Chickenhouse, his well outfitted home studio in his hometown of Uppsala. His work with the band Samla Mammas Manna, in the late 1960s and early 1970s and up to 2002, when the re-formed group played at the two-day ProgDay festival in North Carolina, was and is considered progressive rock. However, he is most centrally an empathetic and generous collaborator: whether as a member of Accordion Tribe, while working with the experimental guitarist Fred Frith, or while spending several months with Japanese jazz players, he seems to find a style that brings his partners to the fore while remaining identifiably himself. Though his work is little known in the United States, he won a Swedish Grammis award in 1999 for his record Andetag. He has also composed extensively for Swedish film, as well as for theatre and dance productions. Consistent elements of his music throughout his career included use of irregular time signatures (often changing several times within a piece), a daring sense of improvisation (particularly vocal improvisation that utilized nonsense syllables), and used complex polyrhythms. Hollmer died in December 2008 of cancer, aged 60. He is buried in Berth\u00e5ga Cemetery in Uppsala. ==Discography== ===With Samla Mammas Manna=== *Samla Mammas Manna 1971 *M\u00e5ltid 1973 *Klossa Knapitatet 1974 *Snorungarnas Symfoni 1976 *Kaka 1999 *Dear mamma 2002 ===With Zamla Mammaz Manna=== *Schlagerns Mystik / F\u00f6r \u00c4ldre Nybegynnare (The Mystery of Popular Music / For Older Beginners) 1977 *Familjesprickor (Family Cracks) 1980 ===With von Zamla=== *Zamlaranamma 1982 * \"1983\" (Live) 1983 *No Make Up 1984 ===With Raml\u00f6sa Kv\u00e4llar=== * Raml\u00f6sa Kv\u00e4llar (Nights Without Frames) 1977 ===With Fem S\u00f6ker En Skatt=== *Fem S\u00f6ker En Skatt 1995 ===With Looping Home Orchestra=== *Vendeltid 1987 *Lars Hollmer.
