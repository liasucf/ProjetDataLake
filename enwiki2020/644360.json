    "text": "Home is the sixth studio album by American country music band Dixie Chicks, released on August 8, 2002, through Monument and Columbia Records. It is notable for its acoustic bluegrass sound, which stands in contrast with their previous two country pop albums. The group was promoting the album when lead singer Natalie Maines made controversial comments about U.S. President George W. Bush criticizing his role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The album's third single, \"Travelin' Soldier\", was #1 on the Billboard Country Chart the week that Maines' comments hit the press. The following week, as many stations started a still-standing boycott of the Chicks' music, the song collapsed. None of their following singles gained traction with country radio. Despite these events, the album was certified 6\u00d7 Multi-platinum status by the RIAA and has sold 5,979,000 copies in the United States up to November 2008.Grein, Paul. \"Chart Watch Extra: Ropin' The Biggest Country Hits\" .
