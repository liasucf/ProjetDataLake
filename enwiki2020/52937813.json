The ships have been in service with the Argentine Navy since 1978. The class is named after the southern coastal area of Argentina which was designed to service. == Design == The Costa Sur class was part of a program to replace cargo ships then in service and reaching obsolescence; three ships were ordered by the Argentine Navy in 1975, and designed and built by the Pr\u00edncipe, Menghi y Penco shipyard, located in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The design is optimised for Patagonic coastal service, which sometimes require them to beach on the shore. ARA Canal Beagle docked in Buenos Aires, 2010. The ships in this class have a steel hull and the superstructure at the stern, with a single mast and a single funnel atop, behind the bridge; the cargo area is located in the middle of the ship and three \u201cLiebherr\u201d cranes serve the three cargo holds: one 5 ton crane serves hold 1, one 12.5 ton crane serves hold 2, and one 12.5 ton crane serves hold 3; the latter can be used simultaneously to provide a 25-ton joint lifting capacity into either hold 2 or 3.For Canal Beagle, the cranes serving holds 2 and 3 have 20 ton lifting capacity individually and 40 ton when used together. The ships have a bulk cargo capacity of or 6,800 tons (e.g.: coal, cereals, live cattle), a refrigerated cargo capacity of , and can carry up to 140 containers. The ships are powered by two 6-cylinder Sulzer 6 ZL 40/48 marine diesel engines of each, driving two variable-pitch propellers; with a maximum speed of . == Service history == With the ships then operating with \u201cNaval Transport Service\u201d ( Servicio de Transportes Navales) approaching obsolescence, the Argentine Navy was authorized (via decree 3/10/1975) to order the local construction of three cargo ships for the southern coastal service. The ships, with hull optimised for Patagonic coastal service, were designed and built by the Argentine Pr\u00edncipe, Menghi y Penco shipyard, at Buenos Aires, Argentina, in the late 1970s and are denominated the Costa Sur class. The first ship in the Costa Sur class, Canal Beagle, was laid down on 10 January 1977 and launched on 19 October 1977; she was commissioned on 29 April 1978 and assigned to the Argentine Navy\u2019s Naval Transport Service with the pennant number B-3. The second ship, Bah\u00eda San Blas, was laid down on 11 April 1977 and launched on 29 April 1978; she was commissioned on 27 November 1978 and assigned to the Naval Transport Service with pennant number B-4. The third (and last) ship in the class, Cabo de Hornos, was launched on 4 November 1978;Cabo de Hornos was launched as Bah\u00eda Camarones, being renamed later. she was commissioned on 28 June 1979 and assigned to the Naval Transport Service with pennant number B-5. ARA Bahia San Blas (B-4) in Gona\u00efves, Haiti In addition to coastal and riverine activities in Argentina, the Costa Sur-class ships also operated overseas. In 1981\u201382 Cabo de Hornos transported from France to Argentina the then new Super \u00c9tendard aircraft incorporated by the Argentine Naval Aviation. In 1989, Canal Beagle and Cabo de Hornos helped remove oil from the shipwreck of the polar transport , in an effort to reduce pollution in the Antarctic waters. In 1991 Bahia San Blas was deployed to the Persian Gulf during operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm carrying humanitarian aid and providing logistic support to the Argentine warships in the area. In 1992 the three ships were involved transporting to the Gulf of Fonseca, Honduras, the four Baradero-class patrol boats used under United Nations mandate ONUCA; and then back to Argentina. Also in 1992, Cabo de Hornos transported troops, vehicles, and supplies of the Argentine Army to Yugoslavia, as part of the UNPROFOR peace mission. In 1998, after the retirement of the tank landing ship , Bah\u00eda San Blas was converted to an amphibious cargo ship and became the main vessel for use by the Argentine Marines. Since 2004, an Argentine contingent was deployed to Haiti under MINUSTAH mandate and she has been used for logistic support making several voyages to the Caribbean island.Operaci\u00f3n Hait\u00ed: misi\u00f3n de paz en el Caribe (accessed 2017-01-14) In 2005, Canal Beagle was part of the naval deployment contributing to the security of the 4th Summit of the Americas ( IV Cumbre de las Am\u00e9ricas) hold in the Argentine city of Mar del Plata. Starting in late 2007, Canal Beagle took part in the Argentine Antarctic Program replacing the icebreaker in the resupply of the Argentine bases in Argentine Antarctica. As of late 2016, the three ships in the class remain in service with the Argentine Navy. == Specifications == == Ships in class == Three ships were built as part of this class. {|width=\"100%\" border=\"2\" !width=\"16%\" align=\"left\" |Ship Name !width=\"16%\" align=\"center\" |Pennant Number !width=\"16%\" align=\"center\" |Other names !width=\"16%\" align=\"center\" |Builder !width=\"16%\" align=\"center\" |Laid down !width=\"16%\" align=\"center\" |Launched !width=\"16%\" align=\"center\" |Service entry !width=\"16%\" align=\"center\" |Decommissioning |- |align=\"center\" |ARA Canal Beagle |align=\"center\" |B-3 |align=\"center\" |none |align=\"center\" |Pr\u00edncipe, Menghi y Penco |align=\"center\" |1977] |align=\"center\" |1977 |align=\"center\" |1978 |align=\"center\" |in service |- |align=\"center\" |ARA Bah\u00eda San Blas |align=\"center\" |B-4 |align=\"center\" |none |align=\"center\" |Pr\u00edncipe, Menghi y Penco |align=\"center\" |1977 |align=\"center\" |1978 |align=\"center\" |1978 |align=\"center\" |in service |- |align=\"center\" |ARA Cabo de Hornos |align=\"center\" |B-5 |align=\"center\" |Bah\u00eda Camarones |align=\"center\" |Pr\u00edncipe, Menghi y Penco |align=\"center\" | |align=\"center\" |1978 |align=\"center\" |1979 |align=\"center\" |in service |} == See also == * List of ships of the Argentine Navy == Footnotes == == References == === Notes === === Bibliography === * == Further reading == * * == External links == * Argentine Navy official site, Costa Sur class page * COMANDO DE TRANSPORTES NAVALES \u2013 Listado de Buques desde 1950 a 2005 at Histarmar Category:Costa Sur class cargo ships Category:Transports of the Argentine Navy Category:Ships built in Argentina Category:1970s ships ",
