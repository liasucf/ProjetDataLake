Retrieved on February 20, 2010. The company's business model is to stimulate demand by providing frequent and affordable air service to underserved markets throughout Brazil. The company was named Azul (\"Blue\" in Portuguese) after a naming contest in 2008, where \"Samba\" was the other popular name. It was established on May 5, 2008 by Brazilian-born David Neeleman (founder of American low-cost airline JetBlue), with a fleet of 76 Embraer 195 jets. The airline began service on December 15, 2008. According to the Brazilian Civil Aviation Authority (ANAC), between January and December 2019 Azul had 23.5% of the domestic and 5.0% of the international market shares in terms of revenue passenger kilometers (RPK), making it the third largest domestic and second largest international airline in Brazil. ==History== Azul Linhas A\u00e9reas Brasileiras S.A. was the fourth airline launched by JetBlue founder David Neeleman (after Morris Air, WestJet and jetBlue). Azul inaugurated services in the Brazilian domestic market on December 15, 2008 between three cities: Campinas, Salvador, and Porto Alegre. It launched operations with three Embraer 195 and two Embraer 190 aircraft. Another three aircraft were added in January 2009 to introduce nonstop service from Campinas to both Vit\u00f3ria and Curitiba. On May 28, 2012, Azul announced the acquisition of TRIP Linhas A\u00e9reas, the largest regional carrier in Brazil. Azul and Trip started comprehensive code-sharing operations on December 2, 2012, with all flights carrying only the IATA code of Azul. On March 6, 2013 Brazilian authorities gave the final approval for the merger with a few restrictions related to code-sharing with TAM Airlines and slot use at Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont Airport. On May 6, 2014 the merger process was completed with the final approval from Brazilian authorities. That day the brand TRIP ceased to exist and all TRIP assets were transferred to Azul. While the airline is not currently a full member in an airline alliance, it signed a codeshare agreement with Star Alliance airline United Airlines in January 2014, which made it possible for MileagePlus members to earn points when flying with Azul beginning April 1, 2014. Since 2015, Azul is also an equal partner in a Brazilian-Portuguese joint venture that is the majority owner of TAP Air Portugal, another Star Alliance member. In December 2014, Azul started its first scheduled international flights; to Fort Lauderdale on December 2 and Orlando on December 15, both in the United States. In early 2015 it was announced that Azul had signed a purchase agreement for 35 Airbus A320neo aircraft. It is also to lease a further 28 of the aircraft type. In mid-2015, Azul finalised a deal for 30 Embraer E195-E2 aircraft (including 20 options) first announced at the 2014 Farnborough International Air Show. The first delivery is scheduled for 2020. On November 24, 2015 it was announced that the Chinese HNA Group, owner of Hainan Airlines, would invest US$450 million in Azul, becoming the largest single shareholder of Azul SA. This follows the US$100 million investment of United Airlines closed in June 2015. Azul proposed to acquire Avianca Brazil, as the carrier signed a non-binding deal to buy its assets on 11 March 2019. Its acquisition plan includes the rehiring of all Avianca Brazil's staff and the merger between the two carriers, with Azul as the surviving brand. Currently, Azul is not a member of Star Alliance despite partnering with its members such as United and TAP, while Avianca Brazil is a member, joining the alliance in 2015. On 14 January 2020 Azul Brazilian Airlines signed an agreement to purchase TwoFlex. On March 27, 2020 the Brazilian regulatory bodies gave the nihil obstat to the purchase and sale of flights started on April 14, 2020. TwoFlex operates as feeder airline to Azul. ==Destinations== An ATR 72-600 of Azul Brazilian Airlines at S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto Airport, Brazil Azul's Embraer 195 in a special Azul Viagens (the airline's travel operator) livery PR-AIV, one of Azul's Airbus A330-200s painted in a special livery at Ft.
