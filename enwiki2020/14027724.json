    "text": "Watershed is the debut solo album by Grant McLennan, founding member of The Go-Betweens released under the name G. W. McLennan. The album was recorded nine months after The Go-Betweens called it quits and was released in 1991. It featured contributions by singer-songwriters Paul Kelly and Dave Dobbyn, ex- Go-Between Amanda Brown (who was now half of Cleopatra Wong with Lindy Morrison) and Phil Kakulas of Blackeyed Susans. Despite this stellar line-up, the album received disappointing sales. ==Track listing== All tracks written by Grant McLennan. # \"When Word Gets Around\" \u2013 4:33 # \"Haven't I Been a Fool\" \u2013 3:23 # \"Haunted House\" \u2013 3:00 # \"Stones for You\" \u2013 3:20 # \"Easy Come Easy Go\" \u2013 4:00 # \"Black Mule\" \u2013 4:45 # \"Putting the Wheels Back On\" \u2013 4:15 # \"You Can't Have Everything\" \u2013 3:09 # \"Sally's Revolution\" \u2013 3:57 # \"Broadway Bride\" \u2013 3:42 # \"Just Get That Straight\" \u2013 3:17 # \"Dream About Tomorrow\" \u2013 5:57 ==Personnel== * Grant McLennan \u2013 guitars, vocals * Paul Kelly * Amanda Brown * Dave Dobbyn \u2013 guitars, keyboards * Huey Benjamin * Ian Belton \u2013 bass * James Cruickshank * Kenny Davis Jnr * \"Diamond Jim\" Elliott * Phil Hall * Phil Kakulas * Francine McDougall * Astrid Munday * Sarah Peet * Stephen Philip * Kit Quarry * Tim Rollinson \u2013 guitar * Kathy Wemyss ==References== Category:1991 debut albums Category:Grant McLennan albums ",
