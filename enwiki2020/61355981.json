    "text": "Ecclesiastes 2 is the second chapter of the Book of Ecclesiastes in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible.Holman Illustrated Bible Handbook. Holman Bible Publishers, Nashville, Tennessee. 2012. The book contains philosophical speeches by a character called Qoheleth (=\"the Teacher\"; Koheleth or Kohelet), composed probably between 5th to 2nd century BCE. Peshitta, Targum, and Talmud attribute the authorship of the book to King Solomon. The chapter continues the presentation of memoir in the previous chapter with more observation on human efforts in life (related to the question in Ecclesiastes 1:3, the sufferings and the enjoyment of life in light of a divine dispensation. ==Text== The original text was written in Hebrew. This chapter is divided into 26 verses. ===Textual witnesses=== Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text, which includes Codex Leningradensis (1008). There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: \\mathfrak{G}S; 4th century), and Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century). The Greek text is probably derived from the work of Aquila of Sinope or his followers. ==The failure of pleasure-seeking (2:1\u201311)== ===Verse 11=== :Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun. KJV This conclusion is an echo from the statements in . *\"Vexation of spirit\" (NKJV: \"grasping for the wind\"; ESV: \"a striving after wind\"): or a 'chasing after wind'. ==A sure fate for all (2:12\u201323)== Ecclesiastes 2:10-26 on the right page and Ecclesiastes 3:1-14 on the left page of the Bible in Hebrew (reading from right to left). The question in this part \u2013 'is there any preference between wisdom and pleasure- seeking?' \u2013 comes out of the problem of life () and two failed remedies ( and 2:1\u201311). The answer is given in verse 13\u201314 where on one hand, wisdom is better than pleasure-seeking, but on the other hand both are equally unable to deal with the problem of death. For Christians, the answer and consolation can be found in the New Testament: \"your labor in the Lord is not in vain\" (). ==The generous God (2:24\u201326)== So far God is only mentioned in , but in this part God is acknowledged as the 'controller of his world, creator of beauty, judge of injustices'. Therefore, the ability to perceive that one should enjoy life is 'a divine dispensation' given only to the righteous people who please God, whereas the remainders have to work on behalf of the righteous. ==See also== * Related Bible parts: Ecclesiastes 1, 1 Corinthians 15 ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * ==External links== * Jewish translations: ** Kohelet \u2013 Ecclesiastes - Chapter 2 (Judaica Press) translation [with Rashi's commentary] at Chabad.org * Christian translations: ** Online Bible at GospelHall.org (ESV, KJV, Darby, American Standard Version, Bible in Basic English) * Ecclesiastes Chapter 2 King James Version * Various versions 02 ",
