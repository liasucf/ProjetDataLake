    "text": "Greatest Hits is the first \"greatest hits\" collection from singer Jody Watley. Executive-produced by Watley, the album highlights her MCA years (1987\u20131994) and contains all of her well-known pop hits, among them \"Looking for a New Love\", \"Real Love\" and \"Everything\"; two of Watley's classics, \"Don't You Want Me\" and \"Some Kind of Lover\", were presented in their more familiar remixed forms. Additionally, Watley (who compiled the collection with Andy McKaie) took care to include lesser-known songs like \"Still a Thrill\" and \"Most of All\". ==Track listing== # \"Looking for a New Love\" (Andr\u00e9 Cymone/Jody Watley) (Single Mix) # \"I Want You\" (A.
