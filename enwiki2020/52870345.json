    "text": "In Broad Daylight is a 1971 American TV film starring Richard Boone, Stella Stevens and Suzanne Pleshette. It was directed by Robert Day and written by Larry Cohen. == Plot == A blind actor comes up with an elaborate scheme to murder his wife and her lover. == Cast == * Richard Boone as Anthony Chapel * Suzanne Pleshette as Kate * Stella Stevens as Elizabeth * John Marley as Bergman * Fred Beir as Alex * Whit Bissell as Moss * Paul Smith as Charles * Ken Sansom as Dr. Grant == Production == Cohen thought \"it wasn't a bad movie\" except for the casting of Boone; Cohen felt Boone's face was so distinctive the concept of the film did not work. Cohen says there was some talk of remaking the film years later as a vehicle for Andrea Bocelli but it did not proceed because of concerns over Bocelli's acting ability. The film was executive produced by Aaron Spelling. == Reception == Academic Tony Williams called the film \"one of Cohen's most innovative works\" despite the miscasting of Boone. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1971 films Category:1971 television films Category:ABC Movie of the Week Category:Adultery in films Category:American films Category:American thriller films Category:English-language films Category:Films about actors Category:Films about blind people Category:Films about murder Category:Thriller television films ",
