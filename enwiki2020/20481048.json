    "text": "Mount Labo, is a potentially active stratovolcano in the province of Camarines Norte, in the Bicol Region (Region V), on Luzon Island, in the Philippines. It is located at the northwest end of the Bicol Peninsula. ==Physical features== Labo is a forested andesitic stratovolcano, surrounded by numerous andesitic to dacitic satellite lava domes. It has an elevation of asl. Base diameter of this complex volcano is . Labo is thermally active with both warm and hot springs. ==Economic activities== Mount Labo has been the object of an extensive geothermal exploration program. ==Eruptions== Mid-Pleistocene eruptions beginning about 580,000 years ago formed lava domes on the northern side of the complex. The present edifice was formed beginning about 270,000 years ago, and flank lava dome emplacement took place from about 200,000 to about 40,000 years ago. The latest activity from Mt. Labo produced pyroclastic flows from the summit cone about 27,000 years ago. There have been no eruptions since. ==Geology== Rock type is predominantly hornblende-biotite andesite to dacite. Tectonically, Labo is part of the Bicol Volcanic belt. ==Listings== The Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program lists Labo as Pleistocene. Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) lists Labo as Potentially Active. ==See also== * List of active volcanoes in the Philippines * List of potentially active volcanoes in the Philippines * List of inactive volcanoes in the Philippines * List of Ultras of the Philippines * Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology * Pacific ring of fire ==References== ==External links== * Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS), Labo page (archived) Category:Stratovolcanoes of the Philippines Category:Subduction volcanoes Category:Volcanoes of Luzon Category:Mountains of the Philippines Category:Landforms of Camarines Norte Category:Potentially active volcanoes of the Philippines ",
