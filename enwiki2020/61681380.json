Cold Days: Judy Ledgerwood, Chicago: The Renaissance Society, 1999. Her early work investigated gender issues encoded in 19th-century landscape painting and mid-20th-century Abstract Expressionism through formal choices informed by being female.Hixson, Kathryn. \"Speakeasy,\" New Art Examiner, January 1996, p. 14\u20135. Her later work has shifted toward less referential, more direct abstraction focused on structure, light, color, decorative motifs, and physical presence and experience; it directly or indirectly references antecedents including Op Art, Matisse, Warhol, and the Pattern and Decoration movement.Waspe, Roland. \"The Instant Joy of Painting,\" Judy Ledgerwood, Ostfildern, Germany: Hatje Cantz, 2009. Retrieved August 19, 2019. Critics identify as central to her work: transgressive use of color as a vehicle for content and critique; imposing scale; attention to spatial relationships between picture plane and edge and surrounding physical space; freely painted, shifting motifs of patterned basic shapes; an emphasis on performative and material aspects of painting; a phenomenological embrace of tenuousness and optical effects regarding the viewing experience.Pagel, David. \"Why Paint?\" Why Paint?: Judy Ledgerwood, Jim Lutes, Kay Rosen, Kevin Wolff, Chicago: The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago, 1992. ===Landscape-related abstraction (1988\u20131993)=== Critic Kathryn Hixson described Ledgerwood's early paintings as cunningly painted \"commodity object[s] of seemingly inspired, moody, atmospheric space\" appropriated from the sublime traditions of Romanticism (Turner, Ryder) and color-field painting (Rothko, Newman), rather than inspired by nature.Hixson, Kathryn. \"Cool, Conceptual, Controversial,\" New Art Examiner, May 1988, p. 30\u201333.

Maureen Sherlock suggested that Ledgerwood's canvasses restaged domestic, \"demure and private gestures\" in powerful, public form through their highly charged synthetic colors (pinks, roses, reds), which evoked female domains (cosmetics, the body, interior design), and intimate markmaking (dabs, finger-painting), which deflated the mythic power and profundity of Abstract-Expressionist gesture. David Pagel described the work as orchestrating a \"double-sided viewing\" that \"surreptitiously traced the power of American abstraction back to nature\" and played havoc with simplistic oppositions such as abstract/representational, pure paint/illusionism, culture/nature. Judy Ledgerwood, \"Sunny Days\" exhibition, 1301PE (Los Angeles), Installation view, 2002 ===Circular-motif abstraction (1993\u20132002)=== In the early 1990s, Ledgerwood transitioned toward patterned abstraction with directly drawn, sharper-edged circular forms that suggested shimmering light (e.g., Blackness Light, 1992;Art Institute of Chicago. \"Blackness Light, 1992, Judy Ledgerwood\", Artworks. Retrieved August 20, 2019. Rainlight, 1993) and increasingly delved into the experience of perception. This work employed monochromatic or limited palettes and dissolving grid arrangements of dots, circles or loops, creating complex, flat plays of oscillating color, tone, surface finish and figure-ground based on light conditions, viewer position and retinal effects; critics suggest that this indeterminacy introduces elements of extended time, discovery, and \"unknowability\" into the viewing experience.Yood, James. \"Post-hypnotic: University Galleries of Illinois State University,\" Artforum, April 1999, p. 120.Ledgerwood, Judy. In ON PTG, Michelle Grabner (ed,), Manawa, WI: Poor Farm Press, 2012. Retrieved August 19, 2019. Ledgerwood explored this motif in various color palettes, combining blacks with pinks, purples, magentas and ultramarine (e.g., Tranquilizer, 1997; Basement Love, 1999) in a series exploring sexuality, and yellows on silver and white in another, Op-Art-like series.Byrd, Cathy. \"Eye-popping aesthetic: Dots, stripes and squiggles vibrate at ACA and Swan Coach House Galleries,\" Atlanta Creative Loafing, February 12, 2000, p. 37\u201338.Hawkins, Margaret. \"Exhibit shows why Op is on top,\" Chicago Sun-Times, May 3, 2000, p. 52.Horodner, Stuart. \"Flat mates,\" Surface, Summer 2000, p. 72\u201373. One of the latter works (the 17' x 35' Groovin' on Lemon, 1995) comprised half of a temporary, site-specific installation commissioned for the new MCA Chicago building, which Ledgerwood described as \"a meditation on light and rhythm.\"Carr, Christopher. \"A grand reopening: The new MCA connects art and life,\" MOSAIC, Northwestern University, Fall 1996, p. 4-5.Artner, Alan G. \"Bigger not Better,\" Chicago Tribune, June 30, 1996, Sec 7, p. 12. The adjacent, same-sized companion, Groovin' on Violet, fully emerged only after a viewer's eyes adjusted, replicating the afterimage formed from viewing the other work. In 1999, Ledgerwood presented \"Cold Days\", a body of work specifically created to interact with the changing winter light that would flood its January exhibition at Chicago's Renaissance Society.Artner, Alan G. \"Judy Ledgerwood\u2019s new works interact with winter light,\" Chicago Tribune, February 5, 1999, Sec. 7, p. 53. The show's centerpiece was a wall of five, 8' x 9' works painted in subtly modulating lilacs, pastel blues, greens, browns and metallic silvers that functioned as an environment. Bearing titles drawn from Miles Davis's Kind of Blue album, the paintings opened to a wide range of allusions, from pop culture, fashion and design to the glamour and effervescence of champagne bubbles to climate (brittle temperatures, the sheen of ice, winter light, whiteouts) and states of contemplation.Wilk, Deborah. \"Judy Ledgerwood,\" New Art Examiner, April 1999, p. 44\u201345.Walker, Hamza. \"The Weeds of Winter,\" Exhibition materials, \"Judy Ledgerwood: Cold Days,\" Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago Newsletter, 1999. Critics compared the work's myriad shifts between obscurity and clarity to those of the Rothko Chapel and Light and Space installations of Robert Irwin. Craig Adcock wrote that the paintings resided \"between being and nonbeing, just between the abyss inside and the boundless horizon outside. The operative category is the sublime, shorn of its macho, Kantian implications.\" In 2002, Ledgerwood created a comparable body of work for exhibition in Los Angeles, titled \"Sunny Days\" (1301PE, 2002). Judy Ledgerwood, Chromatic Patterns for the Graham Foundation, site-specific Installation at Graham Foundation Madlener House, Chicago, 2014 ===Patterned abstraction and wall paintings (2002\u2013 )=== Ledgerwood's later work shifted toward repeated vernacular motifs (chevron and diamond, quatrefoil, and floral patterns) and a more confrontational approach embracing discordant color, an integration of painting and drawing, and greater co-optation of architectural space, including that between painting and viewer.Grabner, Michelle. \"Judy Ledgerwood,\" art US, January-February, 2004, p. 18.Snodgrass, Susan. \"Judy Ledgerwood at Rhona Hoffman Gallery,\" Art In America, January 2004, p. 110.Johnson, Ken. \"Judy Ledgerwood: 'Spring Fever',\" The New York Times, May 27, 2005, p.

Other critics, such as John Yau and Roberta Smith, have focused on an anarchic element in the work, which foregrounds imperfection and irregularity, process and messiness, humor and female sexuality, and challenges notions of the sublime and beautiful.Yau, John. \"Judy Ledgerwood 'April Showers': Tracy Williams,\" The Brooklyn Rail, June 2011, p.52.
