    "text": "The 1974 Alabama gubernatorial election took place on November 5, 1974. Incumbent Democratic Governor George Wallace was reelected in a landslide over his Republican opponent, businessman Elvin McCary. Wallace was the first Alabama governor to win election to a second consecutive term, as the state's Constitution was amended in 1968 to allow governors to serve a maximum two elected consecutive terms. This was also Wallace's first campaign after having been paralyzed following being shot by Arthur Bremer in an assassination attempt during Wallace's run for the 1972 Democratic presidential nomination. ==Democratic primary== * George Wallace, incumbent Governor ==Republican primary== * Elvin McCary, businessman ==Results== ==References== 1974 Gubernatorial Alabama Alabama gubernatorial election ",
