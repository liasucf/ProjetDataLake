Cambremer is located in the heart of the Pays d'Auge, between Lisieux and Caen. ==Etymology== We do not know the exact etymology of the name of the town. The village is mentioned, however, from the seventh century under the Latinized form of Cambrimaro. The second element is probably the Germanic meaning lake or pond (see Old English meri: lake, pond, now in place names -M\u00e8re). Common in the north of France (see Mortemer ). ==History== In 1972, the commune of Grandouet in the canton of Cambremer and those of Saint-Aubin-sur-Algot and Saint-Pair-du-Mont, in the township of M\u00e9zidon- Canon, were incorporated in Cambremer.
