    "text": "Operation S.I.N. is a five issue comic book miniseries published by Marvel Comics. ==Publication history== The series was published in 2015 and designed to capitalize on the premiere of \"Marvel's Agent Carter\" on ABC and to tie into the 2014 Marvel crossover event Original Sin. ==Plot== In the early 1950s, an alien energy source is discovered in Russia. Peggy Carter and Howard Stark try to find it - but a newly risen terrorist group named Hydra is also on the hunt for it. When the mysterious Woodrow McCord enters the picture and Stark accidentally causes a UFO to fire on Moscow, Peggy and her team must go underground. They discover a Hydra-run gulag that hides a mysterious woman just as Soviet scientists open a portal between worlds, and ancient terror is released. ==Reception== Matt Little of CBR.com expressed that the comic had a well-designed debut full of great art and stylish dialogue, but it didn't do much to distinguish itself outside of being a period piece. Jesse Schedeen of IGN stated that story in this issue is pretty unremarkable but that the characters are charming and have a good relationship, the setting is well-done and the art is good. ==Collected editions== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
