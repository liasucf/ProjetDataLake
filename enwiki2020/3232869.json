The song was written by Michael, Patrice Rushen, Freddie Washington and Terri McFaddin with production by Michael and Jon Douglas. The song received positive reviews from music critics. Commercially, the song topped the charts in six countries: Australia, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom, and it also reached number one on the Canadian RPM Adult Contemporary chart. It was Michael's seventh and final number-one single in the UK during his lifetime and is his seventh-most downloaded track there, earning him a Gold certification from the British Phonographic Industry. It has sold 465,504 copies in the UK and was nominated for Best Single at the 1997 Brit Awards. In the United States it peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Michael his fifteenth top-ten hit and final single to reach the top 100. The song's music video which directed by Vaughan Arnell and Anthea Benton, was nominated for the video category at the Brit Awards and three MTV Video Music Awards in 1996, eventually won the International Viewer's Choice Award\u2014MTV Europe. ==Release== \"Fastlove\" is an energetic tune about the need for gratification and fulfillment without concern for commitment. The song was the second single taken from Michael's third studio album Older, which was his first studio album in six years and only the third of his solo career. For the single's B-side, a remake of the Wham! classic \"I'm Your Man\" was used. Entitled \"I'm Your Man '96\", it was an update of one of their last singles, a decade earlier. Jon Kutner from 1000 UK Number One Hits said the line \"Stupid Cupid keeps on calling me and I see lovin' in his eyes\" had a dual interpretation which could imply Michael's homosexuality. ==Critical reception== While reviewing Older, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic said although \"Fastlove\" is the album's only dance track, but it still \"lacks the carefree spark of his earlier work.\" He later still chose the song as his one of his \"track picks.\" Larry Flick from Billboard described the song as a \"sleek groove that is a direct descendant of \"Good Times\" by Chic.\" He noted that Michael \"deftly cruises between breathy sensuality and full-bodied belting\", adding that the \"icing on the cake is a chorus and refrain that are immediate sing-along fodder.\" Cash Box wrote that \"Fastlove\" \"pumps up both the volume and the velocity for a terminally danceable, happy-feet track that's sure to become a staple in discos across the U.S.\" They also said that it features \"the sort of ultra-lush, opulent soul vibe that's been Michael's hallmark throughout his career.\" Entertainment Weekly's Jim Farber gave the song an \"A\", he stated: \"It took real guts to release a salute to a one-night stand in this, the era of abstinence,\" also praising its \"devilishly seductive bass\" and \"sleekly probing horns\". Ferber concluded his review by calling the track \"best slow-groove dance record since Lisa Stansfield's 'All Around the World.'\" Hans-Petter Kj\u00f8ge from Norwegian newspaper Fredrikstad Blad described it as \"quality pop of the best brand.\" Swedish newspaper G\u00f6teborgs-Tidningen said it is \"nicely funky\".G\u00f6teborgs-Tidningen. 10 May 1996. Music & Media called it a \"uncomplicated, good-time funky dance track in which the repetition of the title has a lasting effect.\" They also commented that the production and atmosphere is \"owing much to late-'70s disco grooves\". Writing about the album for Rolling Stone, Al Weisel called the track a \"bouncy disco concoction\" and \"flavored with Dr. Dre-style whistling synths.\" Michael E. Ross from Salon Magazine said that Michael \"gets back to bold, bumptious funk, the singer clearly reveling in those buoyant rhythms of the not-too-distant past.\" In 2014, Brendon Veevers from British webzine Renowned for Sound ranked the song at number 4 on his \"Top 10 George Michael Hits\" list, stating: \"[The song] is a slick, ultra-modern dance-pop track that sits quite contrasting to the rest of the Older tracks but has held up exceptionally well over the past almost-20 years since it was offered to us.\" In 2017, Dave Fawbert of ShortList Magazine called Fastlove \"one of the greatest songs ever made\", noting that, at a time when Britpop was at its height \"George Michael decided to completely ignore it and release a truly slinky R&B;/soul number which announced, with the utmost style, that he would be just as relevant in the '90s as he had been in the '80s.\" He was also full of praise for Fastlove Part II, although criticized the \"Summer Mix\" of the song as lacking \"the fruity bass of the original\".\"A nine-and-a-half-minute long version of George Michael's 'Fastlove' exists and it will change your life\", Shortlist, Accessed 12 April 2017 Fawbert later produced a half-hour version of Fastlove as a homage.\"George Michael's 'Fastlove' is not long enough, so I made a half-hour long version\", Shortlist, Accessed 12 April 2017 This song is featured in the 2019 Universal Picture Last Christmas alongside its soundtrack. ==Chart performance== The song reached the number one spot in United Kingdom, where it stayed for three weeks.
