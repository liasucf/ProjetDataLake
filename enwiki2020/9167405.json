His father was a lawyer, a leader of Egypt's nationalist movement and an art patron who promoted the development of the arts in Egypt. After high school, Wassef wanted to become a sculptor but changed his mind and studied architecture in France at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts de Paris. His thesis project \"A Potter's House in Old Cairo\" received the first prize in 1935. He had a passion for beauty in form and believed \"one cannot separate beauty from utility, the form from the material, the work from its function, man from his creative art \" After Wassef's death, his family donated his original architecture drawings to the Rare Books and Special Collections Library at the American University in Cairo. == Architectural and design career== Banque Misr Building and Hotel at Opera Square - Perspective Old Cairo Potter's HouseAt the beginning of his career in 1935, Wassef was struck by the beauty of the medieval towns and the old quarters of Cairo. He felt that ancient craftsmen had managed to derive from their traditional heritage an infinite variety of expression and created effects distinguished by local character. He developed an architectural style that bore the stamp of his own strong personality and responded to the challenge of the times without breaking away from the past. Impressed as he was by the beauty of the Nubian houses in the villages around Aswan, which still preserved the domes and vaults, inherited form the earliest Pharaonic dynasties, he resolved to maintain their presence in his own architectural work for reasons of aesthetics, climate and economics. He made use of traditional craftsmen such as stonecutters, traditional carpenters, glass blowers and potters who had inherited the techniques and traditions of the Egyptian vernacular heritage. Wassef taught architecture and art at the Department of Architecture, College of Fine Arts, Cairo, which he also chaired. ==Designs== *Potter's House in Old Cairo *French College of Daher *French School of Cairo * Mahmoud Mokhtar Sculpture Museum (), Cairo * Saint Mary Coptic Church in Zamalek, Cairo * Several churches in Cairo, Alexandria and Damanhour, including the Church of St. George in Heliopolis * The Junior Lycee school at Bab al-Louq Cairo * His home in Agouza, Cairo and several private houses along the Saqqara road near the Pyramids * Adam Henein House, Harrania Giza.

Collection of The Children's Museum of Indianapolis. Wissa Wassef founded the Ramses Wissa Wassef Art Centre in 1951, located in the Harrania district of Giza, near the Giza pyramids in the Greater Cairo region. He established it to teach young Egyptian villagers how to create art, including tapestries. He believed that children are endowed with creative power and potential. Wissa Wassef wanted to prove that artistic creativity is innate in everyone, and regardless of deadening influences from mass-produced objects, it can flourish within supportive settings such as the Art Centre. The Ramses Wissa Wassef Art Centre won the Aga Khan Award for Architecture from the Aga Khan Development Network in 1983. The Art Centre is open to the public, with an art museum exhibiting its early tapestry works, and a museum shop selling contemporary tapestry works by Art Centre artists. Tours are available, upon contacting the Art Centre in advance to schedule. The Ramses Wissa Wassef Art Centre has operated continuously since opening in 1951, with its artists creating tapestries there for over 60 years. The Centre's artists create the designs and weave the tapestries directly from their imaginations onto the looms. Pre- designed patterns have never been used, proving Wissa Wassef's belief that artistic creativity is intrinsic, and can be expressed when a supportive context is available. The renowned textile artists Ali Selim and Karima Ali, who began as children at the Centre in the 1960s and 1970s, continue to weave tapestry masterworks, now up to in width. ==Exhibitions== The tapestries have been internationally recognized since the late 1950s. Many exhibitions have been held in Europe and the Smithsonian Institution organized a traveling exhibit in the USA in 1975-76. The most recent exhibition was at the Coningsby Gallery in London, UK, during November 2012. A simple paperback catalog was published for the 2006 for an exhibition at the School of Oriental and African Studies in the University of London to mark the center's 50th anniversary. \"Egyptian Landscapes\" is a book of photographs that highlights the work of the center. 1954 - Organized by the group Amities Francaises,Cairo, Alexandria and Ismallia, Egypt 1954 - Egyptian Art Exhibition,Italy 1956 - The Near East College Association, New York, USA 1958 - Gewerbemuseum, Zurich & Basel, Switzerland 1959 - Bilddteppiche, Krefeild, Germany 1960 - Museum of Modern Art, Stockholm, Sweden 1961 - Kunstindustrimusset, Germany 1961 - National Museum of Modern Art, Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmo, Sweden 1962 - Fodor Museum, Amsterdam, The Netherlands 1963 - Museum Am ost Wall Dortmund, Munich, Germany 1964 - Stedelijk Museum, Groninger Museum Voor Stad en Lande, The Netherlands 1964 - Neue Sammlung Munchen, Munich, Germany 1965 - Musee D\u2019 Arts Decoratifs, Rosenthal Studio-Haus-Delvaux, Paris, France 1966 - Museum of Modern Art, Skovde Konsthall Skovde, Stockholm, Lunds, Sweden 1966 - Congress Mondial, Prague, Czechoslovakia 1967 - Musee D\u2019Arts Decoratifs, Lausanne, Switzerland 1967 - Museum of Modern Art, Stockholm, Sweden 1969 - Royal College of Art, London, England 1971 - Gallery Brand Strupp, Oslo, Norway 1972 - Ideal Home Exhibition, London, England 1973 - Gallery La Demeure, Paris, France 1974 - Al Palazzo Dellarejario, Milan, Italy 1975 - New York Natural History Museum, New York City, USA 1975 - Textile Museum, Washington, DC, USA 1975 - Gallery La Demeure, Paris, France 1977 - Italian Culture Centre, Cairo, Egypt 1978 - Touring exhibition, Berlin, Essen, Stuttgart, Germany 1978 - Gallery La Demeure, Paris, France 1979 - Roemer - und Pelizaeus - Museum, Hildesheim, Germany 1979 - Anneberg Gallery, San Francisco, USA 1979 - Modern Art Museum, Stockholm, Sweden 1981 - University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA 1981 - Egyptian Art Academy, Rome, Italy 1985 - The Barbican Centre, London, UK 1985 - Polytechnic Gallery, Newcastle, UK 1986 - ArtSpace, Aberdeen, UK 1986 - City of Edinburgh Art Centre, Edinburgh, UK 1986 - Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea, Wales, UK 1990 - First Tapestry Triennale, Tournai, Belgium 1991 - Musee Jean Lurcat, Angers, France 1993 - Institut Du Monde Arabe, Paris, France 1995 - Culture Centre, Ha, Norway 1995 - Lebanese/ Egyptian Businessmen\u2019s Association, Beirut, Lebanon 1999 - Egyptian Culture week, Tones, Tunisia 2000 - United Nations, Geneva, Switzerland 2001 - Conservatoire et Jardin Botanique, Geneva, Switzerland 2003 - Green Art Gallery, Dubai, UAE 2004 - Frankfurt Book Fair, Frankfurt, Germany 2006 - Brunei Gallery, SOAS, University of London, London, UK 2009 - Nature in Art Trust, Gloucestershire, UK 2012 - Children's Museum, Take Me There: Egypt!, Indianapolis, USA 2012 - The Coningsby Gallery, London, UK ==Publications== In 1961, renowned photographer Werner Forman discovered the Art Centre by accident while shooting in Egypt.
