    "text": "Albert Kitchener Iles (9 October 1914 \u2013 30 November 1979) was a professional association footballer who played in The Football League for Bristol Rovers prior to the outbreak of World War II. ==Football career== Iles began his footballing career playing in the Southern League for Tunbridge Wells Rangers. His prolific scoring record at that level earned him a professional contract with Bristol Rovers, signed on 24 September 1937. He immediately adjusted to the standard of football in Division 3 (South) of The Football League, and ended the 1937\u201338 season as The Pirates' top goalscorer with 14 goals from 31 games. The following season, he scored a further five goals in fifteen League appearances, as well as featuring regularly for the reserve team. He played once in the aborted 1939\u201340 Football League season, and scored 16 goals in 29 wartime guest appearances for Rovers. He also made two guest appearances for Bristol City. After the war he played for Street, and was later trainer at Bristol St. George. ==Non-footballing life== In 1939 Iles was working as a fitter at the Bristol Aeroplane Company, and he later spent many years working at SWEB in Bristol. ==References== Category:1914 births Category:1979 deaths Category:People from Royal Tunbridge Wells Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Tunbridge Wells F.C. players Category:Bristol Rovers F.C. players Category:Bristol Rovers F.C. wartime guest players Category:Bristol City F.C. wartime guest players Category:Street F.C. players Category:Southern Football League players Category:English Football League players Category:Western Football League players ",
