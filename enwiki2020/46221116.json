The creative small group dynamic developed by Braxton over several decades is very much in evidence as he interacts with bassist Andy Eulau, percussionist Kevin Norton, and guitarist Kevin O'Neil. Braxton's choices are astute and varied enough to make this an exceptionally satisfying effort\". All About Jazz reviewer Glenn Astarita noted \"they inject a modernist edge into the roads previously traveled. With sterling musicianship, the quartet expressively melds sheer firepower with elegance, and a persuasive mode of execution, which seeds a refreshing ambiance into these time-honored standards\".All About Jazz Review, August 18, 2010 ==Track listing== Disc One: # \"Four\" (Miles Davis) - 8:24 # \"Body and Soul\" (Johnny Green, Robert Sour, Frank Eyton, Edward Heyman) - 17:03 # \"G.
