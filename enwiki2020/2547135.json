It was released on August 25, 1981 by Twin/Tone Records. ==Music and lyrics== The track \"Somethin' to D\u00fc\" is a reference to the band H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, contemporaries of The Replacements and their Saint Paul counterparts. The track \"Johnny's Gonna Die\" is a reference to influential guitarist Johnny Thunders of the Heartbreakers and New York Dolls. The song refers to his increased heroin addiction and resultant sloppy live performances. Thunders died, possibly of drug-related causes, in 1991. ==Release== Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash was released on August 25, 1981 by the independent record label Twin/Tone Records.

The album was remastered and reissued by Rhino Entertainment on April 22, 2008, with 13 additional tracks. ==Critical reception== Retrospectively, AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash to be \"one of the best LPs the entire scene produced in the early '80s.\" In a very positive review, Punknews.org praised the album for being different from its counterparts of the hardcore punk scene, stating that the album \"never sacrificed its pop appeal for throat-searing screams and whiplash speed.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Paul Westerberg - vocals, rhythm guitar, producer *Bob Stinson - lead guitar *Tommy Stinson - bass guitar *Chris Mars - drums *Peter Jesperson - producer *Steven Fjelstad - producer, engineer *Paul Stark - mixer *Laurie Allen - photography *Erik Hanson - photography *Greg Helgeson - artwork *Pat Moriarity - artwork *Bruce Allen - artwork ==References== ==External links== * Category:1981 debut albums Category:Albums produced by Paul Westerberg Category:The Replacements (band) albums Category:Rhino Entertainment albums Category:Twin/Tone Records albums ",
