It continuously maintained a trp ranging 1.6 to 1.8. Producer Sandiip Sikcand speaking about the end of the series said, \u201cThe ratings never went above 1.8. The moment we brought in some drama during Sonakshi's wedding, which was very TV\u2014 a psychopath lover and all that, the ratings touched 2.3. And everybody was abusing us. So we said wedding is done, let's come back to our normal KHKT storytelling. Again we came down to 1.7-1.8. And then when the whole drama against Sonakshi was going on we touched a 1.9 again. All this analysis has made one thing very clear, that online everyone say, 'excellent show', but that does not translate into ratings.\" SOL productions founder and managing director Fazila Allana explained, \u201cStar had maintained from the start that they want to break the 2 GRP barrier for the 9pm slot. It is a tough spot and is against a number one show. We came close but couldn't cross it. The channel probably had their own research and decided that they want to experiment with a different kind of story. Even KHKT was an experiment and it worked up to a point.\u201d ==Soundtrack== Written and sung by Shivangi Bhayana, Kahaan Hum Kahaan Tum is composed by Shubham Sundaram. ==Reception== Times Now said, \u201cKahaan Hum Kahaan Tum is a fresh, never seen before love story between a television actress and a doctor.\u201d Times of India noted, \u201cDipika and Karan's fresh pairing looks quite interesting. Both of them have perfectly portrayed their inner vulnerabilities.\u201d The Indian Express stated, \u201cKahaan Hum Kahaan Tum is different from what Indian television has to offer now.\u201d The Quint reviewed, \u201cKahaan Hum Kahaan Tum steers clear of melodrama, and takes a more realistic approach. And the ensuing drama is also peppered with a good dose of well- written humour and lighthearted moments. Dipika is very natural, looks beautiful and really owns every scene she is in, proving her versatility as an actor. Karan\u2019s expressions and comic timing really work for the show. Karan and Dipika\u2019s onscreen relationship is progressive, and their chemistry, in comic, emotional and romantic scenes, is easy and refreshing.\u201d Times of India also appreciated Karan Grover and Dipika Kakar's chemistry. ==Adaptations== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; |- !
