    "text": "Meresankh II (\"She Loves Life\") was a Queen of Egypt who lived during 4th Dynasty. ==Family== Meresankh II's parents are assumed to be King Khufu and Queen Meritites I given that they are mentioned in Meresankh's mastaba. She is never explicitly called their daughter however.Giza pyramids a website maintained by the Boston Museum of Fine Arts; G 7410-7420 Assuming Meresankh's filiation as stated, this would make Meresankh II a full sister of Prince Kawab and Queen Hetepheres II. She was also a sister of Princess Meritites II who was later married to the Palace Director Akhethotep (Akhtihotep). Meresankh II shares her name with her great-grandmother Meresankh I, mother of Sneferu. Meresankh III was a niece of Meresankh II. It is assumed that Meresankh II married her half-brother Horbaef and they had children named Djaty, Nefertkau III and Nebty-tepites.Aidan Dodson & Dyan Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, Thames & Hudson (2004)http://gizapyramids.org Tomb 7410 page * Prince Djaty U29-t-A-i-i His titles: King's son of his body, Overseer of the expedition.

Meresankh II has the titles of a queen and it is usually assumed that her husband Horbaf died and that Meresankh remarried one of the subsequent kings. It is possible that she married her half-brother Djedefre, but it is also possible she married Khafra. ==Titles== The titles of Meresankh II include: * Great one of the hetes-sceptre (wrt-hetes) * She who sees Horus and Seth (m33t-hrw-stsh) * King's Wife (hmt-nisw) * Attendant of Horus (kht-hrw) * King's Daughter of his body (s3t-niswt-nt-kht.f)Grajetzki, Ancient Egyptian Queens \u2013 a hieroglyphic dictionary, London, 2005 ==Tomb and burial== Meresankh II was buried in a double mastaba G 7410\u20137420 with her first husband Horbaef. The tomb was excavated by George Andrew Reisner. Meresankh was buried in a shaft (G 7410B) with two rooms. Horbaef was buried in shaft G 7420A. Meresankh's sarcophagus was found and removed during the 1927 excavations and is now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The sarcophagus is made of red granite and is inscribed on all four sides.
