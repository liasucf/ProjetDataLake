    "text": "Midway Campaign is a strategy game developed by Avalon Hill in 1980 (released across multiple platforms through 1983). It is a wargame using ASCII text for the visuals and is written in BASIC. ==Gameplay== The game reenacts the events between June 4 and June 7, 1942 during the Battle of Midway, which was the turning point for Allied Forces in the Pacific Theater. Gameplay is turn based with each turn representing one hour of the battle. The player controls Task force 16, comprising the Enterprise and Hornet aircraft carriers, Task force 17 comprising Yorktown, and Midway Island. Each task force may be moved on a map in any direction by providing a direction in degrees. During each turn Consolidated PBY Catalinas scout out the location of the enemy Task force comprising Akagi, Kaga, Soryu, Hiryu, and Zuiho. Once a Task Force has been identified and are within range a strike group may be launched from neighboring ships. Planes are generally in three conditions throughout the game. They can be below deck (protected from enemy strikes), on deck arming for a strike, or in the air moving towards or away from a target. Fighters (F4F Wildcats or A6M Zero 'Zekes') can also be established in a combat air patrol (CAP) to protect their carrier. The game ends when either sides carriers are all lost, or if one of the task forces leave the map. ==Reception== Glenn Mai reviewed Midway Campaign in The Space Gamer No. 45. Mai commented that \"Overall this is a very good game, and I highly recommend it for anyone who likes matching wits with the computer.\" ==References== ==External links== * *Review in 80 Micro Category:1980 video games Category:Apple II games Category:Atari 8-bit family games Category:Avalon Hill video games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:Commodore PET games Category:Commodore VIC-20 games Category:DOS games Category:FM-7 games Category:TRS-80 games Category:TRS-80 Color Computer games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in the 1940s Category:Video games set in Oceania ",
