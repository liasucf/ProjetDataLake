The meme can be thoughts, concepts, ideas, theories, opinions, beliefs, practices, habits, songs, or icons. Distortions of corporate logos are also referred to as subvertising.See also Stephen Downes, Hacking Memes (First Monday, volume 4, issue 11) for a detailed description of meme hacks. Another definition is: \"Intentionally altering a concept or phrase, or using it in a different context, so as to subvert the meaning.\"downloaded 21/11/12 from Samizdata ==See also== ==Notes== Category:Culture jamming techniques Hack ",
