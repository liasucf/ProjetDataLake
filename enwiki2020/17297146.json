It is near the National Park of Duna-Ipoly. The B\u00f6rzs\u00f6ny-creek flows through the village. == History == The earlier name of this village was B\u00f6rzs\u00f6ny and was, in all probability, founded in the 12th century by King G\u00e9za II of Hungary. In medieval times, it was able to grow into a full-fledged mining town due to its proximity to various ores, including gold. Documents dating from 1312 already describe these mines. However, the most significant part in the mines' history took place in the eighteenth century. In 1789, P\u00e1l Kitaibel officially discovered the element Tellurium in the Nagyb\u00f6rzs\u00f6ny ores. Two other Hungarians were also noted for their research of the element. In 1782, Franz-Joseph M\u00fcller von Reichenstein, otherwise known as (M\u00fcller Ferenc), independently named the element. A third Hungarian who also laid claim to Tellurium was Ignaz von Born. Muller was from Sibiu/Nagyszeben in what is now Transylvania, and von Born worked in Vienna. In 1798, the new element was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth; the name is derived from the Latin word \"tellus\", meaning earth. Tellurium has thermoelectric applications, and was used in alloys within the steel industry. The element eventually played an important role in the making of the outer shell of the first atom bomb. ==Transport== It is the terminus of a narrow-gauge railway to Szob.https://borzsony-kisvasut.webnode.hu/ == Sightseeings == * The main attraction of the village is an architectural one: The \u00c1rp\u00e1d age romanesque church Szent Istv\u00e1n-templom, built in the 13th century.
