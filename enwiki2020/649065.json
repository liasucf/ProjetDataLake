Until 1376, Lubaczow was spelled Lubacew or Ljubacew. Upon receiving town charter (1376), the spelling of the name was changed into Lubaczow. Until 1462, Lubaczow was governed by the Dukes of Mazovia, a Polish fief. In that year, it was directly annexed into the Kingdom of Poland, as part of the newly created Belz Voivodeship, in which it remained until 1772. During the Polish\u2013Ottoman War (1672\u201376), the Battle of Niemirow took place near Lubaczow (October 7\u20138, 1672). From 1772 until 1918 Lubaczow belonged to Austrian Galicia, as the town was annexed by the Habsburg Empire after the first partition of Poland. In 1868, Austrian authorities moved the seat of the county to nearby Cieszan\u00f3w, while in 1880, Lubaczow received rail connection with Jaros\u0142aw. in 1896 a hospital was built, but three years later, most of the town burned in a large fire. In 1918, Poland was declared an independent state: Lubacz\u00f3w became part of Second Polish Republic\u2019s Lwow Voivodeship. Lubaczow Company of the Polish Army took part in the Polish\u2013Ukrainian War (1918\u20131919). In mid-September 1939, during the Invasion of Poland, heavy fighting between the advancing Wehrmacht and retreating Polish 21st Mountain Infantry Division commanded by General Jozef Kustron. On September 16, the Battle of Oleszyce took place near Lubaczow, in which General Kustron was killed. On September 7, 1939: Lubacz\u00f3w was bombed by German planes, and five days later, the town was occupied by the Germans. On September 26, however, the Red Army seized Lubaczow (see Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact). The town remained under Soviet occupation until June 22, 1941, while German occupation lasted until July 1944, when Lubaczow was recaptured by the Soviets. After World War II, Lubacz\u00f3w was one of few locations of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lw\u00f3w to remain within Poland, when the national boundaries were redrawn in 1945. As a result, former parish church in Lubaczow was named a cathedral, and the part of Lwow Archiodiocese, which remained in Poland, was named the Lubaczow Archdiocese, as Communist government banned all traces of Polish presence of the city of Lwow. In 1984, an inventory of the parish records from the archdiocese of the church archive established there was drawn up. In 1992, the position of the Lubacz\u00f3w area within the Polish diocesan structure was regularized and it became part of the Diocese of Zamo\u015b\u0107-Lubacz\u00f3w. There was still a church archive in Lubacz\u00f3w. In 1999 Lubacz\u00f3w became part of the Subcarpathian Voivodeship. Following World War II and the change of borders, several relics from Eastern Borderlands were transported to Lubaczow. Among them was the miraculous picture of Our Lady of Belz, relics of Blessed Jakub Strzemie, and the urn with heart of Archbishop Jozef Bilczewski. Furthermore, from 1946 until 1980, the miraculous painting of Our Blessed Lady from Latin Cathedral, Lviv was kept at Lubaczow. It was brought here by Archbishop Eugeniusz Baziak. ==Jews of Lubacz\u00f3w == * 1498: The Jews of Lubacz\u00f3w are mentioned for the first time, when they were granted a lease to collect Lubacz\u00f3w customs duties that year. * 1532: The Polish King forbade the Jews of Lubacz\u00f3w to do any business with the population in the surrounding villages. * 1538: Tax records show that there were eighteen Jewish families living in Lubacz\u00f3w who paid taxes to the King. * 1565: The lustration of this year mentions only three Jewish families living in the town. * 1621, 1633 & 1639: Lubacz\u00f3w Jews were involved in trade and crafts, and also had the right to brew beer.
