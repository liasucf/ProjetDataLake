    "text": "Catherine Leigh Osterman (born April 16, 1983) is an American, former collegiate 4-time All-American and 2-time medal winning Olympian, unretired 6-time pro All-Star, left-handed softball pitcher and former softball Assistant Coach originally from Houston, Texas. She completed her college eligibility in 2006 at the University of Texas at Austin, where she was a starting pitcher for the Longhorns since 2002. Osterman pitched on the USA Women's Softball Team which won the gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics and the silver medal in the 2008 Summer Olympics. Osterman holds the Big 12 pitching Triple Crown for leading in career wins, ERA, strikeouts, as well as shutouts, no-hitters, WHIP and perfect games, additionally claiming the NCAA Division I record for strikeout ratio (14.34). In the National Pro Fastpitch, Osterman is the career leader in strikeout ratio (10.90) and no-hitters (6). She owns numerous other records for the Longhorns and within the NCAA Division I, where she is also one of five pitchers to strikeout 1,000 batters with 100 wins, an ERA of under 1.00, and averaging double digit strikeouts. Osterman currently is a member of Team USA softball that has qualified for the postponed 2020 Summer Olympics as well as the independent \"This is Us\" team. In May of 2020, she also signed to join a new softball pro league under Athletes Unlimited that will begin play in August 2020. Osterman was also named #3 Greatest College Softball Player. ==Early years== She started playing softball in first grade before quitting to play soccer and basketball. Osterman found her way back to the diamond in fifth grade, when she was filling in as a backup pitcher for a little league team. Osterman was born in Houston, Texas to parents Gary and Laura Osterman. Her younger brothers are Craig and Chris. She attended Cypress Springs High School in Cypress, Texas from 1997 to 2001, where she set several records on the school's softball team. In 2001, she struck out 33 batters in a 14-inning 1\u20130 shutout over Cy- Fair High School. The performance ranked 16th on the list of strikeouts in a single game. As such, she set a national record for strikeouts in a game less than 20 innings, beating Jenny Stallard's previous record of 31 in 19 innings in 1978; she also set a national record for strikeouts in a 14-inning game, breaking Michele Granger's former record of 31 in 1985. ==University of Texas== ===2002: Freshman year=== Osterman was named a National Fastpitch Coaches' Association Second Team All-American. She was also named Big 12 First Team and \"Pitcher of The Year.\" She broke and set UT single-season records for wins (led the NCAA), innings pitched, games started, shutouts, strikeouts, strikeout ratio (led the NCAA) and appearances. Currently only her inning pitched and games started remain top season records from this year. Her freshman ERA was and is a top-5 school record. Osterman also set the UT single-game record for innings-pitched (14) and single game strikeouts. She also tied the UT single-season record for complete games. Osterman debuted on February 6, tossing six shutout innings, allowing two hits and fanning 11 of the Texas A&M;\u2013Corpus Christi Islanders. In a March 20 no-decision against the Texas State Bobcats, she struck out 24 in over 10-innings for a career best. That game also was and is a top-5 NCAA record for combined strikeouts at 34, which she shares with Nicole Neuerburg and tied Osterman fourth for an individual pitcher's total in a single game all-time. Osterman became the first UT freshman to be named Big 12 Conference Pitcher of the Week, for the week of February 19, in which she threw two no-hitters. The first, a 3\u20130 win over the Utah Utes on February 13 and then a 4\u20130 win over the Texas State Bobcats on February 15. They were only the third and fourth no-hitters by a UT freshman, and Osterman became only the second Longhorn pitcher to accomplish the feat, along with Natalie King in 2001. She also threw the first perfect game in UT history in a game against Stephen F. Austin State Lumberjacks on February 26. She proceeded to throw two more in her freshman season to match and set two all-time NCAA Freshman Class records for season no-hitters (5) and perfect games (3), the latter record has since been surpassed. ===2003: Sophomore year=== Osterman repeated honors as an All-American, now a First Team selection, as well as Big 12 \"Pitcher\" and \"Female Athlete\" of The Year. She also earned her first USA Softball Collegiate Player of the Year award. Osterman threw 4 no-hitters and a perfect game, while breaking her own UT records for ERA, shutouts and strikeout ratio (all-time NCAA Sophomore Class record), of which she also led the NCAA in, except shutouts; the strikeout ratio was a new NCAA season record. She also tied her own shared record for complete games and posted career records in wins (68), shutouts (35), strikeouts (1,042), and opponents-batting-average (.105). From April 22 \u2013 May 22, she pitched a career high and UT record 65 consecutive scoreless innings. The streak began with a win against the Texas A&M; Aggies and was broken in a 3\u20132 win over the ULL Ragin' Cajuns; the streak ran over 12 games (7 complete) and 11 wins and included 115 strikeouts, 16 hits and 9 walks. Osterman is so far the second pitcher in NCAA history to strike out 1,000 batters in only two seasons and in that very same game on May 22, during the Women's College World Series vs. the ULL Ragin' Cajuns, she struck out 11 to reach the milestone. Osterman also is noted for just needing over 500 innings pitched to get into the club, the fewest of any NCAA Division I pitcher. With that win, Osterman and the Longhorns the next day advanced to meet the California Golden Bears, whom Osterman shutout with 17 strikeouts to tie Lisa Ishikawa's WCWS record for a single game performance. In a doubleheader on the 25, the Longhorns lost to the UCLA Bruins in back-to-back games and were eliminated. Osterman was named to the All-Tournament Team for her efforts. ==2004: XXVIII Olympiad== Osterman redshirted from UT to participate with fellow college softball pitcher Jennie Finch in the Olympic Games in Athens. ===Aiming for Athens=== Osterman went undefeated in 24 appearances during the USA Softball National Team's 53-game schedule. On February 20, she struck out 9 batters in four perfect innings and combined with Finch for a no-hitter. On May 17, she struck out 7 of 9 batters over three innings, after which Finch struck out the final six batters in a row to combine for a perfect game and defeat the Sonic Stars, 10\u20130. On July 10, she struck out 13 batters over 5-innings for another no- hitter, this time missing perfection on a lone error by first-baseman Stacey Nuveman in a 16\u20130 win over the Fort Worth All-Stars. ===Olympic Games=== Osterman picked up two wins and a save in the Olympiad. She followed Finch and Lori Harrigan of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas by striking out the final two batters in Team USA's 7\u20130 victory over Italy on August 14; she gave up one hit and struck out 11 batters over 8-innings in Team USA's 3\u20130 victory over Japan on August 16; and she gave up one hit and four walks while striking out 10 batters over 6-innings in Team USA's 3\u20130 victory over Chinese Taipei on August 20. Her 23 strikeouts led Team USA. ==Return to the University of Texas== ===2005: Junior year=== Osterman received her second First Team All- American citation and repeated honors from the Big 12 and USA Softball. She also added the Honda Sports Award for softball that year as well. Osterman was named the 2005 Sportswoman of the Year (in the team category) by the Women's Sports Foundation. She also topped her previous UT single-season records for ERA (career best), strikeouts, strikeout ratio (all-time NCAA Junior Class record), shutouts, opponents batting average and complete games. The opponents BA remains the school record and Osterman again led the NCAA in ERA and strikeout ratio in addition; the ratio was another new all-time record. Finally, she set Big 12 records in ERA, strikeouts and opponents batting average, of which only the strikeouts has been surpassed. She finished the season at third place on the all-time NCAA single-season strikeout list. Osterman threw 6 no-hitters (an NCAA top-5 season record) and three more perfect games (another NCAA top-3 and Junior Class season tying record) while setting a career best WHIP. Osterman was and is still the only pitcher to have two three perfect game seasons, including 2002. On February 27, Osterman combined with Anjelica Selden of the UCLA Bruins to strike out 31 batters in an 8-inning win for the Longhorns. She also struck out 20 or more batters in four separate games, one of which came on March 17 vs. the No. 1 Arizona Wildcats; Osterman struck out 23 in a 10-inning shutout. The game tied her combination strikeouts record of 34, this time with Alicia Hollowell. Beginning on March 4, the Longhorn posted a career best 24.2 consecutive hitless innings when she surrendered a first-inning hit to the Evansville Purple Aces to open a three-game series before shutting them down for the rest of the game. The next day, Osterman threw the final 1.2 innings by striking out all batters faced in an eventual win for the Aces. On March 9, Osterman struck out her 1,200th batter to tie Lisa Ishikawa of Northwestern University for 10th place on the NCAA all-time strikeout list; the victory was also her sixth career perfect game. On March 11, she moved past Ishikawa and passed Jocelyn Forest of the University of California, Berkeley to take ninth place with a second consecutive no-hitter against the UTEP Miners. Finally, on March 14, Osterman came on in relief vs. the UCLA Bruins and retired the first five batters before the streak ended with a sixth-inning leadoff single. Overall, Osterman allowed only two walks and struck out 64 batters in four wins over 5 games during the streak. On March 15, she reached 1,229 to surpass Amanda Renfro of Texas Tech for eighth place; on March 17, she passed Shawn Andaya of Texas A&M; to take seventh place. On March 23, she struck out her 1,291st batter, passing Sarah Dawson of the University of Louisiana at Monroe for sixth place.

On April 6, she passed Danielle Henderson for fifth place on the NCAA all-time strikeout list; on April 10, she struck out 7 in 3.1 innings to surpass Britni Sneed for fourth place. On April 13, she passed Nicole Myers to take third place; on April 16, she struck out 13 in a 3\u20132 win over the University of Missouri to become the third member of the 1,400-strikeout club (along with Michele Granger and Courtney Blades). Later she would again whiff 24 to match her own school record vs. the Texas Tech Red Raiders and along with Erin Crawford combined for another 31 strikeouts on April 26. On May 12, she crested the 1,500-strikeout plateau; on June 3, she broke the 1,600-strikeout mark. On June 2, Osterman opened her WCWS by matching her shared record with 17 strikeouts vs. the Alabama Crimson Tide. The team eventually lost to the UCLA Bruins on June 5, who in turn lost to the eventual champions the Michigan Wolverines, to whom the Longhorns had also lost to earlier in the tournament. Osterman and Alicia Hollowell set a new WCWS record for combined strikeouts at 30 in their 11-inning battle; Osterman was named All-Tournament. ===2006: Senior year=== Osterman earned honors for a final time from the NFCA, Big 12 and USA softball. Again Osterman also collected her second Honda Award. She broke and set her final set of Longhorn records in wins, strikeouts, shutouts and strikeout ratio (all-time NCAA Senior Class record), all were career highs. Osterman became one of the first pitchers to have three 500-strikeout seasons to her credit. For a fourth time in her career, Osterman led the NCAA in ERA and strikeout ratio, setting a new all-time season record in the latter category at 15.4. These would help her to a Big 12 pitching Triple Crown for the best in wins, ERA and strikeouts for that year. Osterman pitched 5 no-hitters (NCAA top-5 season record) and opened the season with six consecutive shutouts, including an opening day no-hitter and a 16\u20130 romp over the Oklahoma Christian Lady Eagles. On February 11 she won her 100th career game, 3\u20130, against the Northwestern Wildcats in shutout fashion.

Later she also struck out 20 batters in a 7-inning, 5\u20131 win over the UTSA Roadrunners on February 21 (the Senior Class record for a regulation game), which is tied second most in NCAA history and her career best at Texas for a regulation game.

On March 3, she recorded her 110th career win over Ole Miss Rebels to pass Salinger and tie Jenny Voss for 15th place; the next day, she recorded her 111th career win over the Houston Cougars to pass Voss and tie Samantha Iuli at 14th place. In a win over the Washington Huskies on March 16, Osterman combined with Danielle Lawrie for 32 strikeouts in regulation, then the highest combined total in the NCAA for a single 7-inning game. On March 17, Osterman struck out 13 Michigan Wolverines batters in her first loss of the season (following 17 consecutive wins) to become the first pitcher in NCAA Division I history to enter the 1,900 Strikeout Club.

On June 1, Osterman recorded her 136th and final NCAA career win, finishing in sixth place on the all-time list. In the win, Osterman struck out 18 Arizona State Sun Devils to set a new WCWS 7-inning game record; she also brought her season total to 608, passing Monica Abbott's 2005 strikeout total for second place on the single-season strikeouts list, 33 behind Courtney Blades's all-time record. The win was also her 85th NCAA career shutout, putting her in second place behind Michele Granger's career record 94 shutouts. Osterman's NCAA career hopes for a World Series championship ended on June 3; following a 2\u20130 loss to the Arizona Wildcats on June 2, she lost her second game in a row, 2\u20130 again, to the Bruins (who had ended the Longhorns run for a championship in 2003 and 2005). Osterman ended her career with school records in wins, strikeouts, ERA, WHIP, innings pitched, shutouts, strikeout ratio and opponents batting average. She continues to hold the crown for all categories. Osterman claims the Big 12 records for all the same categories minus the innings pitched and opponents batting average.

On August 28, Osterman made her television broadcast debut when she was the color commentator for ESPN2's broadcast of the National Pro Fastpitch championship and all-star games. In 2007, Osterman appeared sparingly on ESPNU broadcasts as a color commentator for certain college softball games, including the game in which Monica Abbott surpassed her own career strikeout record. ==Professional career== On February 15, 2006, Osterman was the first overall pick in the National Pro Fastpitch (NPF) softball league draft. She was chosen by the Connecticut Brakettes. The Brakettes were formerly known as the Stratford Brakettes of the Amateur Softball Association. However, even though Osterman had been on their amateur roster for the five seasons prior to being drafted, she chose not to sign with them, making her officially a free agent on September 30. On December 19, 2006, the Rockford Thunder of the NPF announced that they signed Osterman to a contract for the 2007 season. Per team policy, terms of the deal were not disclosed. On May 29, 2007, Osterman pitched her professional debut, striking out 24 batters in a 12-inning, 1\u20130, win over the Chicago Bandits, which tied the league single game strikeout record.

On August 23 The Pride won the Cowles Cup championship, and she helped throwing two shutout wins resulting in back-to-back MVP awards on August 23. She also threw her fifth career no-hitter on July 5. Osterman opened the 2015 season with three wins for 21 consecutive victories dating back to 2013, a career highlight.
