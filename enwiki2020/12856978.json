    "text": "Coat of arms of the Prince Royal of Portugal Prince Royal of Portugal (Portuguese: Pr\u00edncipe Real de Portugal), officially Prince Royal of Portugal and the Algarves (Pr\u00edncipe Real de Portugal e dos Algarves), was the title held by the heir-apparent or presumptive to the Kingdom of Portugal, from 1825 to 1910. From 1815 to 1825 the title was Prince Royal of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. == History == The title was created in 1815, as Prince Royal of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves (Pr\u00edncipe Real de Portugal, Brasil, e os Algarves), when John VI of Portugal, at the time Prince-Regent for Maria I, elevated colonial Brazil to the rank of a Kingdom, creating the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. When Portugal recognized the independence of Brazil, in 1825, the title of the Portuguese heir apparent was changed to Prince Royal of Portugal and the Algarves. With the deposition of the Portuguese monarchy, in 1910, and King Manuel II's death in 1932, the title became abeyant. ==List of Princes Royal== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Name !Lifespan !Tenure !Notes !Parents !Image !Heir To |- |align=\"center\"| Jo\u00e3o |align=\"center\"| 13 May 1767 \u2013 10 March 1826 |align=\"center\"| 16 December 1815 \u2013 20 March 1816 |align=\"center\"| Later: King Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal and the Algarves |align=\"center\"| Maria I of Portugal Pedro III of Portugal |align=\"center\"| 100px |align=\"center\"| Maria I of Portugal |- |align=\"center\"| Pedro |align=\"center\"| 12 October 1798 \u2013 24 September 1834 |align=\"center\"| 20 March 1816 \u2013 10 March 1826 |align=\"center\"| Later: King Pedro IV of Portugal and the Algarves |align=\"center\"| Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal Carlota Joaquina of Spain |align=\"center\"| 100px |align=\"center\"| Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal |- |align=\"center\"| Pedro |align=\"center\"| 16 September 1837 \u2013 11 November 1861 |align=\"center\"| 16 September 1837 \u2013 15 November 1853 |align=\"center\"| Later: King Pedro V of Portugal and the Algarves |align=\"center\"| Maria II of Portugal Fernando II of Portugal |align=\"center\"| 100px |align=\"center\"| Maria II of Portugal |- |align=\"center\"| Carlos |align=\"center\"| 28 September 1863 \u2013 1 February 1908 |align=\"center\"| 28 September 1863 \u2013 19 October 1889 |align=\"center\"| Later: King Carlos I of Portugal and the Algarves |align=\"center\"| Lu\u00eds I of Portugal Maria Pia of Savoy |align=\"center\"| 100px |align=\"center\"| Lu\u00eds I of Portugal |- |align=\"center\"| Lu\u00eds Filipe |align=\"center\"| 21 March 1887 \u2013 1 February 1908 |align=\"center\"| 19 October 1889 \u2013 1 February 1908 |align=\"center\"| Premature death |align=\"center\"| Carlos I of Portugal Am\u00e9lie of Orl\u00e9ans |align=\"center\"| 100px |align=\"center\"| Carlos I of Portugal |- |align=\"center\"| Afonso |align=\"center\"| 31 July 1865 \u2013 21 February 1920 |align=\"center\"| 1 February 1908 \u2013 5 October 1910 |align=\"center\"| Monarchy abolished |align=\"center\"| Lu\u00eds I of Portugal Maria Pia of Savoy |align=\"center\"| 100px |align=\"center\"| Manuel II of Portugal |- |} ==See also== *Prince of Portugal *Prince of Brazil *Prince of Beira *Infante *List of Portuguese monarchs *List of heirs to the Portuguese throne Category:Heirs to the throne Category:Princes of Portugal Category:Portuguese monarchy Category:Princes Royal of Portugal ",
