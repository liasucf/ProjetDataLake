    "text": "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland competed at the 2002 Winter Paralympics held in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States, from 7 to 16 March 2002. The team was known by it shortened name of Great Britain, for identification purposes. The team was able to be made up of athletes from the whole United Kingdom; athletes from Northern Ireland, who elected to hold Irish citizenship under the pre-1999 article 2 of the Irish constitution, were eligible to represent either Great Britain or Ireland at the Paralympics. However no Northern Irish athletes took part in the Winter Paralympics until 2010 in Vancouver. In order to be eligible to take part in the Games athletes had to have a disability that fell into one of the six Paralympics disability categories. Two British athletes competed, both in alpine skiing events, and no medals were won. The size of the team was a decrease from that which had entered previous Games, in the 1998 Winter Paralympics 20 British athletes had participated. One reason for this is that whilst funding for the two athletes was provided by the British Paralympic Association, it totalled only \u00a31,500 compared to the \u00a34 million worth of funding available to British athletes at the 2002 Winter Olympics. ==Alpine skiing== Both of Britain's athletes at the Games competed in alpine skiing events, funding for the two athletes was provided by the British Paralympic Association. Russell Docker, who was paralysed from the waist down following a skiing accident in 1995, appeared at the Paralympics for the first time and competed in the LW12 classification. He crashed out in the downhill event and failed to complete his other three races. Stephen Napier, who was disabled after being knocked off a motorbike by an unmarked police car in 1995, also competed in four events in the LW10 classification. His highest finish was sixth in the Super-G and he also had three seventh-place finishes. In each of his events Napier was the lowest ranked athlete to complete the course. ;Calculated time To ensure a fair event when athletes with differing disabilities compete, times achieved are sometimes modified by a factor percentage, to produce a result known as \"Calculated Time\". It is this time that decides the result of the races. Actual times recorded is also listed. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:90%\" |- !Athlete !Event !Time !Factor (%) !Calculated time !Rank |- |rowspan=4|Russell Docker |Downhill LW12 |align=center colspan=4|Did not finish |- |Giant slalom LW12 |align=center colspan=4|Did not finish |- |Slalom LW12 |align=center colspan=4|Did not finish |- |Super-G LW12 |align=center colspan=4|Did not finish |- |rowspan=4|Stephen Napier |Downhill LW10 |align=center|2:13.93 |align=center|81.27254 |align=center|1:48.85 |align=center|7 |- |Giant slalom LW10 |align=center|3:43.04 |align=center|79.52176 |align=center|2:57.37 |align=center|7 |- |Slalom LW10 |align=center|3:34.38 |align=center|66.95783 |align=center|2:23.55 |align=center|7 |- |Super-G LW10 |align=center|1:54.33 |align=center|79.98729 |align=center|1:31.45 |align=center|6 |} ==See also== *Great Britain at the Paralympics *Great Britain at the 2002 Winter Olympics ==References== ==External links== *International Paralympic Committee official website Category:Nations at the 2002 Winter Paralympics 2002 Paralympics Category:Winter sports in the United Kingdom ",
