Like their previous album Vessel (2013), the album takes influence from various genres, including hip hop, rock, pop, reggae, and indie. Lyrically, the album incorporates themes of mental health, doubt, and religion. It contains the successful singles \"Stressed Out\" and \"Ride\", which both reached the top-five on the Billboard Hot 100. Blurryface was well-received by critics, who complimented its themes and musical diversity. It is considered to be the band's breakthrough album, becoming their first to reach number one on the Billboard 200. The album has sold over 1.5 million copies in the United States as of April 2017. In 2018, Blurryface became the first album in the digital era to have every track receive at least a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. On May 15, 2019, it reached the milestone of being on the Billboard Top 200 Album chart for four years, never leaving the chart. == Background and recording == Twenty One Pilots at Brixton Academy, London Following the release of their third album Vessel (2013), the band toured extensively in support of the album worldwide. While on tour the band had a portable recording studio that allowed them to lay down ideas. \"Heavydirtysoul\", \"Fairly Local\", \"Tear in My Heart\", \"Lane Boy\" and \"Doubt\" were recorded with producer Ricky Reed at Serenity West Recording in Hollywood, California. \"Stressed Out\", \"Polarize\", \"Hometown\" and \"Not Today\" were recorded with producer Mike Elizondo at Can Am in Tarzana, California. \"Ride\" was recorded with Reed at Sonic Lounge Studios in Grove City, Ohio. \"The Judge\" was recorded with producer Mike Crossey at Livingston Studios in London. \"We Don't Believe What's on TV\" and \"Goner\" were recorded with Reed at Paramount Recording Studios in Hollywood, California. \"Message Man\" was recorded with Tim Anderson at Werewolf Heart in Los Angeles, California. The album was mixed by Neal Avron, with assistance from Scott Skrzynski, at The Casita in Hollywood, California. The album was mastered by Chris Gehringer at Sterling Sound in New York City. ==Title and artwork== The album is named after a character the band created called Blurryface. According to Joseph, he \"represents all the things that I as an individual, but also everyone around, are insecure about.\" Joseph wears black paint on his hands and neck during his live shows and music videos for the album, to represent Blurryface, saying: \"Very dramatic, I know, but it helps me get into that character.\" Art direction and design was done by Brandon Rike, Reel Bear Media and Virgilio Tzaj. Rob Gold was the art manager, while Josh Skubel was in charge of packaging production. Jabari Jacobs provided photography. Rike mentions on his blog about the different feel of the artwork from Vessel and how the red on Blurryface is \"the color of passion, violence, and anger\", although the band is famous for their content being open to interpretation. ==Release== On March 17, 2015, the band announced the album's title, track listing and release date.
