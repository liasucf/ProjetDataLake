    "text": "The Sula (; ) is a left tributary of the Dnieper with a total length of 363 km and a drainage basin of 19,600 km\u00b2. The river flows into the Dnieper through the Kremenchuk Reservoir, with which it forms a large delta with numerous islands, on which rare kinds of birds live. An important tributary is the Uday, smaller ones being Orzhytsya, Sliporid, Romen and Tern. Large cities located on the river are Romny, Lokhvytsia and Lubny. The river's name evokes slow or muddy waters considering the words it is related to: Lithuanian/Latvian sul\u00e0 \"birch sap\", Old Prussian sulo \"curdled milk\", Norwegian dialectal saula \"dirt\", Sanskrit s\u00far\u0101 \"spiritous liquor\", and Avestan hur\u0101 \"intoxicating drink, kumis\".Orel, Vladimir. A Handbook of Germanic Etymology. Leiden, Netherlands: Brill, 2003: 320. Another etymology of the hydronym Sula is the Turkic suly, 'filled with water, wet'.Yu.N.
