WENRA want to be a European network of chief regulators of EU countries with nuclear power plants (and Switzerland as well as of other interested European countries which have been granted observer status) to improve nuclear safety. ==Missions== The main purpose of WENRA are to develop : * a European approach to nuclear safety ; * provide an independent capability to examine nuclear safety in applicant countries ; * to be a network of chief nuclear safety regulators in Europe ; * to be a place where exchanging experience and discussing significant safety issues for regulators. ==Members== They are the representatives of authorities or nuclear regulators from 10 countries (in 1999) brought to 17 countries (March 2003), including at least : * Belgium \u2013 Federal Agency for Nuclear Control (FANC) (http://www.fanc.fgov.be) * Belgium \u2013 BEL V (http://www.belv.be) * Bulgaria \u2013 Nuclear Regulatory Agency (NRA) (http://www.bnsa.bas.bg) * Czech Republic \u2013 State Office for Nuclear Safety (S\u00daJB) (http://www.sujb.cz) * Finland \u2013 Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK) (http://www.stuk.fi) * France \u2013 DGSNR * France \u2013 Agence de s\u00fbret\u00e9 nucl\u00e9aire (ASN) (http://www.asn.fr) * France \u2013 Institute de Radioprotection et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nucl\u00e9aire (IRSN) (http://www.irsn.fr) * Germany \u2013 Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) (http://www.bmu.de) * Hungary \u2013 Hungarian Atomic Energy Authority (HAEA) (http://www.haea.gov.hu) * Italy \u2013 Department of Nuclear, Technological and Industrial Risk National Agency for Environmental Protection and for Technical Services (ISPRA) (http://www.apat.gov.it) * Lithuania \u2013 State Nuclear Power Safety Inspectorate (VATESI) (http://www.vatesi.lt) * Netherlands \u2013 Inspectorate of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (VROM) (http://www.vrom.nl/international) * Romania \u2013 National Commission for Nuclear Activities Control (CNCAN) (http://www.cncan.ro) * Slovak Republic \u2013 (Nuclear Regulatory Authority of the Slovak Republic (\u00daJD) (http://www.ujd.gov.sk) * Slovenia \u2013 SNSA (Ministry of Environment, Spatial Planning and Energy) (http://www.gov.si/ursjv) * Spain \u2013 Spanish Nuclear Safety Council (CSN) (http://www.csn.es) * Sweden \u2013 Swedish Radiation Safety Authority (SSM) (http://www.stralsakerhetsmyndigheten.se) * Switzerland \u2013 Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate (ENSI) (http://www.ensi.ch) * UK \u2013 Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) (http://www.onr.org.uk) * Armenia \u2013 Armenian Nuclear Regulatory Authority (ANRA) (http://www.anra.am) * Austria (observateur) \u2013 Ministry for Agriculture and Forestry, Environment and Water Management (BMLFUW) (http://www.lebensministerium.at/en) * Ireland (observateur) \u2013 Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) (http://www.rpii.ie) * Luxembourg (observateur) \u2013 Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) (http://www.ms.etat.lu) * Norway (observateur) \u2013 Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority (NRPA) (http://www.nrpa.no) * Poland (observateur) \u2013 Nuclear Atomic Energy Agency (PAA) (http://www.paa.gov.pl) * Russian Federation \u2013 Federal Environmental, Industrial and Nuclear Supervision Service (Rostechnadzor) (http://www.gosnadzor.ru/) * Ukraine \u2013 State Nuclear Regulatory Committee of Ukraine (SNRCU ) (http://www.snrc.gov.ua/nuclear/en/index) And three more observers invited (Armenia, Russian Federation and Ukraine) in 2009 ==Publications by WENRA == * RHWG Progress towards harmonisation of safety for existing reactors in WENRA countries (January 2011) * WGWD Waste and spent fuel storage safety reference levels report (version 2.1, February 2011) * WENRA statement on safety objectives for new nuclear power plants (November 2010) * 2010: Revised WENRA Terms of Reference * WGWD Waste and spent fuel storage safety reference levels report (version 2.0, March 2010) * RHWG Safety Objectives for New Power Reactors (Study report December 2009, safety objectives in their final wording are presented in the statement November 2010) * WENRA Presentation (August 2009) * RHWG Safety Reference Levels (January 2008) * RHWG Safety Reference Levels (Modifications of March 2007) * RHWG PSA Explanatory Note (March 2007) * WGWD -
