The event took place on November 26, 2000 from the U.S. Cellular Arena in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. ==Storylines== The event featured wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. ==Event== {| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\" |+ Other on-screen personnel !Role: !Name: |- |rowspan=3|Commentator |Tony Schiavone |- |Mark Madden |- |Stevie Ray |- |Interviewer |Gene Okerlund |- |rowspan=4|Referee |Mark Johnson |- |Nick Patrick |- |Charles Robinson |- |Billy Silverman |- |rowspan=2|Ring announcer |Michael Buffer |- |David Penzer |} Twelve matches were contested at the event. The main event was a straitjacket steel cage match between Booker T and Scott Steiner for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Steiner won the title by knocking Booker out with a Steiner Recliner after hitting him with a steel chair. Other prominent match on the card was Goldberg versus Lex Luger, with the stipulation that Goldberg would be forced to retire if he lost. The event featured many title matches including a WCW World Tag Team Championship match, in which Perfect Event defended the titles against The Insiders in a rivalry stemming from the New Blood versus Millionaire's Club angle from earlier in the year. ==Results== ==References== ==External links== *Mayhem 2000 Category:WCW Mayhem Category:Events in Milwaukee Category:2000 in Wisconsin Category:Professional wrestling in Milwaukee Category:November 2000 events in the United States Category:2000 World Championship Wrestling pay- per-view events ",
