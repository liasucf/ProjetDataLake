    "text": ":This page discusses a class of topological groups. For the wrapped loop of wire, see Solenoid. The Smale-Williams solenoid. In mathematics, a solenoid is a compact connected topological space (i.e. a continuum) that may be obtained as the inverse limit of an inverse system of topological groups and continuous homomorphisms :(Si, fi), fi: Si+1 -> Si, i \u2265 0, where each Si is a circle and fi is the map that uniformly wraps the circle Si+1 ni times (ni \u2265 2) around the circle Si. This construction can be carried out geometrically in the three-dimensional Euclidean space R3. A solenoid is a one-dimensional homogeneous indecomposable continuum that has the structure of a compact topological group. In the special case where all ni have the same value n, so that the inverse system is determined by the multiplication by n self map of the circle, solenoids were first introduced by Vietoris for n = 2 and by van Dantzig for an arbitrary n. Such a solenoid arises as a one-dimensional expanding attractor, or Smale\u2013Williams attractor, and forms an important example in the theory of hyperbolic dynamical systems. == Geometric construction and the Smale\u2013Williams attractor == A solid torus wrapped twice around inside another solid torus in R3 The first six steps in the construction of the Smale-Williams attractor. Each solenoid may be constructed as the intersection of a nested system of embedded solid tori in R3. Fix a sequence of natural numbers {ni}, ni \u2265 2\\. Let T0 = S1 \u00d7 D be a solid torus. For each i \u2265 0, choose a solid torus Ti+1 that is wrapped longitudinally ni times inside the solid torus Ti. Then their intersection : \\Lambda=\\bigcap_{i\\ge 0}T_i is homeomorphic to the solenoid constructed as the inverse limit of the system of circles with the maps determined by the sequence {ni}. Here is a variant of this construction isolated by Stephen Smale as an example of an expanding attractor in the theory of smooth dynamical systems. Denote the angular coordinate on the circle S1 by t (it is defined mod 2\u03c0) and consider the complex coordinate z on the two-dimensional unit disk D. Let f be the map of the solid torus T = S1 \u00d7 D into itself given by the explicit formula : f(t,z) = \\left(2t, \\tfrac{1}{4}z + \\tfrac{1}{2}e^{it}\\right). This map is a smooth embedding of T into itself that preserves the foliation by meridional disks (the constants 1/2 and 1/4 are somewhat arbitrary, but it is essential that 1/4 < 1/2 and 1/4 + 1/2 < 1). If T is imagined as a rubber tube, the map f stretches it in the longitudinal direction, contracts each meridional disk, and wraps the deformed tube twice inside T with twisting, but without self-intersections. The hyperbolic set \u039b of the discrete dynamical system (T, f) is the intersection of the sequence of nested solid tori described above, where Ti is the image of T under the ith iteration of the map f. This set is a one-dimensional (in the sense of topological dimension) attractor, and the dynamics of f on \u039b has the following interesting properties: * meridional disks are the stable manifolds, each of which intersects \u039b over a Cantor set * periodic points of f are dense in \u039b * the map f is topologically transitive on \u039b General theory of solenoids and expanding attractors, not necessarily one-dimensional, was developed by R. F. Williams and involves a projective system of infinitely many copies of a compact branched manifold in place of the circle, together with an expanding self-immersion. == Pathological properties == Solenoids are compact metrizable spaces that are connected, but not locally connected or path connected. This is reflected in their pathological behavior with respect to various homology theories, in contrast with the standard properties of homology for simplicial complexes. In \u010cech homology, one can construct a non-exact long homology sequence using a solenoid. In Steenrod-style homology theories,http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Steenrod- Sitnikov_homology the 0th homology group of a solenoid may have a fairly complicated structure, even though a solenoid is a connected space. == p-adic solenoids == Solenoids whose n_i have the same value p are known as p-adic solenoids \\mathbb{T}_p.https://www.individual.utoronto.ca/jordanbell/notes/padicsolenoid.pdfhttp://www- users.math.umn.edu/~garrett/m/mfms/notes/02_solenoids.pdfhttp://www- users.math.umn.edu/~garrett/m/mfms/notes_2013-14/12_1_adeles.pdf A ring structure could be defined on \\mathbb{T}_p in one of two ways: as the direct product of the circle ring \\mathbb{T} = \\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z} and the ring of p-adic integers \\mathbb{Z}_p, or in a process similar to the algebraic construction of the p-adic numbers by inverse limits as follows: We start with the inverse limit of the rings (see modular arithmetic): a -adic solenoid is then a sequence such that is in , and if , then . Every real number when expressed in base p defines such a sequence by and can therefore be regarded as a -adic solenoid. For example, in this case tau as a 2-adic solenoid would be written as the sequence (0.2831853071..., 0.2831853071..., 2.2831853071..., 6.2831853071..., 6.2831853071..., 6.2831853071..., ...). The operators of the ring amount to pointwise addition and multiplication of such sequences. This is well defined because addition and multiplication commute with the \"\" operator; see modular arithmetic. As a result, -adic solenoids have a base p doubly infinite positional notation representation, similar to p-adic integers or real numbers. ===Profinite real numbers=== A profinite real number is an element of the ring :\\widehat{\\mathbb{R}} = \\varprojlim \\mathbb{R}/n\\mathbb{Z} = \\prod_p \\mathbb{T}_p where \\varprojlim \\mathbb{R}/n\\mathbb{Z} indicates the profinite completion of \\mathbb{R}, the index p runs over all prime numbers, and \\mathbb{T}_p is the p-adic solenoid. ==See also== *Protorus, a class of topological groups that includes the solenoids *Pontryagin duality *Inverse limit *p-adic number *Profinite integer == References == * D. van Dantzig, Ueber topologisch homogene Kontinua, Fund.
