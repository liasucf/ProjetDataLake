State of Texas In 1866 he was elected to the legislature from the Seventy- first District, where he strongly supported ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, designed to protect the citizenship of recently freed slaves. He felt that failure to support the amendment would be interpreted as disloyalty to the Union. Black did not stand for re-election. Black's attempt to form a strong local Union League has been debated as a factor in his murder by friend George Washington \"Tom\" Wall in October 3, 1867. Others offer the point of view that the murder was the result of a falling out between the two friends over money from a business deal.
