    "text": "Caffeine is the eponymous debut album by the free improvisation trio consisting of Jim Baker on piano, Steve Hunt on percussion and Ken Vandermark on reeds. It was recorded in 1993 and released on Okka Disk. By the time of recording, Vandermark and Hunt were members of the NRG Ensemble.Caffeine at Okka Disk ==Reception== In his review for AllMusic, Alain Drouot states \"the music is extremely dense, despite the fact that the session only involves a trio and the musicians avidly seek to fill all the spaces. Despite its shortcomings, Caffeine manages to sustain the listener's interest due to, in particular, Hunt's and Baker's attention to details.\" The Penguin Guide to Jazz notes that \"'with Baker and Hunt, Vandermark is slightly too exposed.\" The Chicago Tribune review by Howard Reich says \"Baker's restless pianism, Vandermark's penetrating reed work and Hunt's meticulous percussion perpetually react to one another in unexpected, novel ways.\"Reich, Howard. Caffeine review at Chicago Tribune The Down Beat review by Bill Shoemaker states \"Caffeine provides high-energy blow-outs followed by explorations of space and color. Baker's first recorded outing is appetite-whetting, as he skillfully skirts Taylor's long shadow.\"Shoemaker, Bill. Caffeine review. Down Beat September 95: page 46.
