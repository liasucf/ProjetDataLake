The Basler L\u00e4ckerli (also Leckerli or L\u00e4ggerli, lecker meaning \"delicious\" in German and -li being a diminutive suffix) is a traditional hard spice biscuit originating from Basel, Switzerland. It is made of honey, hazelnuts, almonds, candied peel, and Kirsch. The flat baked dough is, when still hot, cut into rectangular pieces. It is then topped with a sugar glaze. Basler L\u00e4ckerli were originally created by local spice merchants over 700 years ago and are available year-round. ==See also== *Culinary Heritage of Switzerland ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Biscuits (British style) Category:Culinary Heritage of Switzerland Category:Swiss confectionery Category:Cuisine of Basel Category:Nut dishes ",
