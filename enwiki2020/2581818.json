    "text": "Opening Night is a 1977 American drama film written and directed by John Cassavetes, and starring Gena Rowlands, Ben Gazzara, Joan Blondell, Paul Stewart, Zohra Lampert, and Cassavetes. ==Plot== Myrtle Gordon is a famous, middle-aged actress performing out-of-town previews of a new play called The Second Woman before its Broadway run. While leaving the theatre after a performance, Myrtle signs autographs and encounters an obsessive teenaged fan, Nancy, who runs after Myrtle into the street and is struck by a car. Myrtle is unsettled by the incident, and even goes to the girl's shiva, though her family greets her coolly. Myrtle struggles to connect with the character she is playing in The Second Woman, finding her to have no motivation beyond her age. Over the course of numerous performances, Myrtle departs from the play's script in myriad ways, including changing her lines, throwing props around the set, breaking the fourth wall, and collapsing on stage. This frustrates others involved with the play. The writer, Sarah Goode, attempts to force Myrtle into facing her age. Myrtle admits to her that she sees visions of Nancy\u2014the teenager killed in the car accident\u2014which Myrtle considers a projection of her youth. Myrtle's state of mind deteriorates. She imagines Nancy attacking her, and later she throws herself against the walls of Sarah's hotel room, breaking her sunglasses and slashing her face. After storming out of a rehearsal, Myrtle visits Sarah's spiritualist and has another violent encounter with her vision of Nancy, this time fighting back and \u201ckilling\u201d Nancy's ghost. Myrtle attempts to seduce Maurice Aarons\u2014her leading man and a former lover\u2014but he refuses. Myrtle doesn't show up on time for her call on opening night. When she finally arrives, Myrtle is so drunk that she can barely stand. With the audience growing restless, director Manny Victor demands the show go on. Myrtle struggles through the show's opening scenes, collapsing before her entrance and again on stage. As the show continues, Myrtle finds something of a rhythm. By the end, she and Maurice go off script and improvise the play's final act, to the producers\u2019 chagrin and the audience's rapturous applause. ==Cast== * Gena Rowlands as Myrtle Gordon * Ben Gazzara as Manny Victor * Joan Blondell as Sarah Goode * Paul Stewart as David Samuels * Zohra Lampert as Dorothy Victor * John Cassavetes as Maurice Aarons * John Tuell as Gus Simmons * Laura Johnson as Nancy Stein * Lady Rowlands as Melva Drake ==Release== In common with earlier films, Cassavetes struggled to get Opening Night distributed in the United States. After a number of preview screenings, it opened on December 25, 1977, at the Fox Wilshire Theater, Los Angeles where it played to almost empty houses, and closed in February having never been commercially shown elsewhere. Screenings in New York City that March were similarly ignored. The film was only picked up by an American distributor in 1991, two years after Cassavetes' death. In 1978, it was entered into the 28th Berlin International Film Festival, where Gena Rowlands won the Silver Bear for Best Actress. The film was screened out of competition at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival. ==Reception== Opening Night was critically panned in the US on its release. The review in Variety that appeared after a press screening concluded, \"One must question whether more than a handful of moviegoers are interested in the effort, whether audiences have not already seen enough of Cassavetes' characters ... He's made these films before and not many seemed interested in them.\" When it opened in New York, the film was not reviewed at all in most newspapers and magazines. The film was better received in Europe, and its reputation has improved since its initial release. It currently holds a 96% \"fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 26 reviews; the consensus states: \"Opening Night is as dense and difficult as one would expect from John Cassavetes, but even the director's detractors will be unable to deny the power of Gena Rowlands' performance.\" Film critic Dan Schneider wrote, of the film's narrative structure: > Many critics have taken this film to be a portrait of an alcoholic ... But > this is wrong, for alcohol isn't her problem - nor is her chain smoking. > They are merely diversions from whatever thing is really compelling her to > her own destruction, and much to Cassavetes' credit, as a storyteller, he > never lets us find out exactly what's wrong with Myrtle, and despite her > coming through in the end, there's no reason to expect that she has really > resolved anything of consequence. This sort of end without resolution links > Cassavetes directly with the more daring European directors of the recent > past, who were comfortable in not revealing everything to an audience, and > forcing their viewers to cogitate, even if it hurts. ==In pop culture== The Hold Steady's 2008 album Stay Positive makes various allusions to the film; the closing song \"Slapped Actress\" is the most explicit. Savages' 2013 album Silence Yourself starts with sampled dialogue from the film. 'Back to the Beat', an EP from the band, Motion City Soundtrack, features a song titled \"Opening Night\", in reference to the film. Pedro Almod\u00f3var repeats the film's accident scene in his film All About My Mother as the center of the dramatic conflict. ==References== ==Further reading== *Ray Carney.
