    "text": "The Hyde Exploring Expedition, sponsored by brothers Talbot and Fred Hyde Jr., and directed by Dr. George H. Pepper, conducted excavations in Chaco Canyon from 1896 to 1901, when accusations of impropriety levied by Edgar L. Hewett put an end to their archeological surveys. A subsequent investigation by Steven Holsinger of the US General Land Office vindicated the Hydes and their partner, Richard Wetherill. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Category:Archaeology of the United States Category:Chaco Canyon Category:Chaco Culture National Historical Park Category:Colorado Plateau Category:New Mexico Territory ",
