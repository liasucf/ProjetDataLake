    "text": "During the early 17th century, England's relative naval power deteriorated, In the course of the rest of the 17th century, The office of the Admiralty and Marine Affairs steered the Navy's transition from a semi-amateur Navy Royal fighting in conjunction with private vessels into a fully professional institution, a Royal Navy. Its financial provisions were gradually regularised, it came to rely on dedicated warships only, and it developed a professional officer corps with a defined career structure, superseding an earlier mix of sailors and socially prominent former soldiers.Rodger, Safeguard, pp. 395\u20138; Rodger, Command, pp. 33\u201355, 95\u2013122Ollard, 1984, ch.16; ==Historical overview== Sovereign of the Seas After 1603 the English and Scottish fleets were organized together under James I but the efficiency of the Navy declined gradually, while corruption grew until brought under control in an inquiry of 1618. James concluded a peace with Spain and privateering was outlawed. Between 1618 and 1628, a Navy Commission temporarily replaced the Navy Board, due to misappropriation of public funds by board commissioners. After the inquiry was over the office of the Lord High Admiral (held by the Duke of Buckingham) was restored. However, he was murdered and King Charles I put the office into commission. This led to the creation of a new Board of Admiralty which in its early formation was just the Privy Council in another reincarnation. This in turn also led to the removal of the Admiralty Court from direct control of the Lord High Admiral's. His office was temporarily restored again in 1638, but then put in commission once more after 1679 the Lords Commissioners of Admiralty became the permanent officers responsible for administration of the Navy. ==Organization in the seventeenth century== ===Admiralty of England=== File:Tudor Ensign 1485-1603.svg|Tudor Ensign 1600-1603 File:Stuart Royal Navy Squadron Ensign of 1620.svg|Stuart Navy Squadron Ensign 1603-1620 File:English White Ensign 1620.svg|English Navy White Ensign 1620-1707 ====Commanders-in-chief==== * Queen Elizabeth I * King James I & VI * King Charles I * Lord Protectors, Oliver Cromwell, Richard Cromwell * King Charles II * King James II & VII * King William III and Queen Mary II * Queen Anne ====Naval Lords of England==== *Office of the Lord High Admiral of England **Vice-Admiral of England and Deputy Lord High Admiral ***Rear-Admiral of England ====Civil administration of the Navy==== Notes: the Secretary of State England for the period 1628 to 1679 was responsible for all policy decisions and direction on behalf of the government due to a continued state of war. =====Board of Admiralty===== The Board of Admiralty and the Lord's Commissioners executing the office of the Lord High Admiral * The Board of Admiralty First Commissioner and First Lord of the Admiralty **First Lord of the Admiralty, and member of the English government ***Clerk of the Admiralty ****Messenger of the Admiralty, appointed, 1687 ****Housekeeper of the Admiralty appointed (1687 - 1799) ****Doorkeeper of the Admiralty, 1687 ****Gardner of the Admiralty appointed (1687 - 1799) Civil Commissioner *Chief Secretary to the Admiralty (1628 - 1652) *First Secretary to the Admiralty (1652 - 1871) Naval Commissioner * Naval Lord from (1682 - 1689) * Senior Naval Lord from (1689\u20131771) Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty 91 commissioners served during the 17th century.

At that time there were three such Courts, appointed by Admirals responsible for waters to the north, south and west of England. In 1483 these local courts were amalgamated into a single High Court of Admiralty, administered by the Lord High Admiral of England. The Deputy Lord High Admiral presided over the High Court. ====Admiralty courts==== *Lord High Admiral of England **Vice Admiral of England and Deputy Lord High Admiral ***Advocate General to the office of the Lord High Admiral Legal advisors to the admiralty courts *Office of the Lord High Admiral **Counsel to the Admiralty,(1673 - 1824), attached originally to the Navy Board **Solicitor for the Affairs of the Admiralty and Navy, appointed (1692 - 1799) ====High court of the admiralty==== *Office of the High Court of the Admiralty Court (1450 - 1875) **Judge of the High Court of Admiralty **Judge Advocate of the Fleet ***Deputy Judge Advocate of the Fleet **Proctor of the High Court of Admiralty **Marshall of the High Court of Admiralty **Droits of the High Court of Admiralty ====Vice admiralty courts==== The Vice-Admiral of the Coast was responsible for the defence of one of the twenty maritime counties of England, the North and South of Wales. As a Vice-Admiral, the post holder was the chief of naval administration for his district. His responsibilities included deciding the outcome of the Prize court (captured by pirate ships), dealing with salvage claims for wrecks, and acting as a judge in relation to maritime issues. * Vice-Admiral Cheshire (1559 - 1835) * Vice-Admiral Cornwall (1559 - 1917) * Vice-Admiral Cumberland (1559 - 1835) * Vice-Admiral Devon (1559 - 1835) * Vice-Admiral Dorset (1559 - 1835) * Vice-Admiral Durham (1559 - 1835) * Vice-Admiral Essex (1559 - 1835) * Vice-Admiral Gloucestershire (1559 - 1835) * Vice-Admiral Hampshire (1558 - 1846) * Vice-Admiral Kent (1558 - 1846) * Vice-Admiral Lancashire (1569 - 1861) * Vice-Admiral Lincolnshire (1565 - 1862) * Vice-Admiral Norfolk (1554 - 1846) * Vice-Admiral Northumberland (1559 - 1847) * Vice-Admiral Somerset (1561 - 1865) * Vice-Admiral Suffolk (1554 - 1947) * Vice-Admiral Sussex (1559 - 1860) * Vice-Admiral Westmorland (1559 - 1802) * Vice-Admiral Yorkshire (1559 - 1860) Vice Admiralty jurisdictions and prizes abroad By appointing Vice-Admirals in the colonies, and by constituting courts as Vice-Admiralty Courts, the terminology recognized the existence and superiority of the \"mother\" court in the United Kingdom. Thus, the \"vice\" tag denoted that whilst it was a separate court, it was not equal to the \"mother\" court. In the case of the courts abroad, a right of appeal lay back to the British Admiralty Court, which further reinforced this superiority. In all respects, the court was an Imperial court rather than a local Colonial court.
