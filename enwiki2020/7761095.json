The following year, the album was nominated for Blockbuster Rock Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 1998. ==Chart Performance== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1998) !Peak position |- |- |} ==Reception== Critics gave differing opinions on the music and lyrics of Smile and Wave. When reviewing the album's music, the Calgary Herald said the album went for the \"rock jugular from start to finish\", though the Toronto Star called the Headstones' work \"a murky, steaming cauldron of pungent rock 'n' roll\". Alternatively, reviewers gave mixed reviews for Hugh Dillon's performance. The Edmonton Journal said Dillon's personality was better than his singing, while the Ottawa Journal felt that Dillion's sarcastic lyrics were almost too much for the album. ==References== Category:1997 albums Category:Headstones (band) albums Category:MCA Records albums Category:Albums recorded at Metalworks Studios ",
