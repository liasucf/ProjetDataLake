Over the next forty years it expanded into providing education and training for jockeys, stable staff, racehorse breeders, racehorse trainers and other people involved in the thoroughbred industry. It is located in Curragh House, formerly the home of William Hall-Walker, an important figure in thoroughbred racehorse breeding. The campus has extensive landscaped grounds and is located near the Curragh Racecourse and many training establishments. RACE is a not- for-profit educational establishment and registered charity and is supported by the racing industry and various state agencies. Students from over thirty countries have been trained here, and many have moved on to make considerable contributions to the global racing sector. The chairman is trainer John Oxx. ==References== ==External links== * RACE official website Category:Education in County Kildare Category:Sport in County Kildare Category:Horse racing in Ireland Category:Educational institutions established in 1973 Category:1973 establishments in Ireland Category:Jockey schools ",
