    "text": "The map shows the division of the Norwegian dialects within the main groups. The Norwegian dialects are commonly divided into 4 main groups, 'Northern Norwegian' (nordnorsk), 'Central Norwegian' (tr\u00f8ndersk), 'Western Norwegian' (vestlandsk), and 'Eastern Norwegian' (\u00f8stnorsk). Sometimes 'Midland Norwegian' (midlandsm\u00e5l) and/or 'South Norwegian' (s\u00f8rlandsk) are considered fifth or sixth groups. The dialects are generally mutually intelligible, but differ significantly with regard to accent, grammar, syntax, and vocabulary. If not accustomed to a particular dialect, even a native Norwegian speaker may have difficulty understanding it. Dialects can be as local as farm clusters, but many linguists note an ongoing regionalization, diminishing or even elimination of local variations. Normalized speech, following the written languages Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk or the more conservative Riksm\u00e5l and H\u00f8gnorsk, is not in common use, except in parts of Finnmark (where the original Sami population learned Norwegian as a second language), in much of \u00f8stlandet, certain social groups in major urban areas elsewhere (e.g. Trondheim), in national broadcasting, and in courts and official decrees. == Dialect groups == * West and South Norwegian ** South Norwegian (Aust-Agder, most of Vest- Agder and Fyresdal, Nissedal, Drangedal and Krager\u00f8 in Telemark) ** South-West Norwegian (inner parts of Sogn og Fjordane, Hordaland (except the city of Bergen), Rogaland, and western parts of Vest-Agder) ** Bergen Norwegian or Bergensk (Bergen) ** North-West Norwegian (Romsdal, Sunnm\u00f8re, Nordfjord, Sunnfjord and outer parts of Sogn) * North Norwegian **Helgeland Norwegian (Nordland county south of Saltfjellet, except for Bindal) ** Nordland Norwegian (Nordland county north of Saltfjellet) ** Troms Norwegian (Troms county, except for Bardu and M\u00e5lselv) ** Finnmark Norwegian Finnmark county, except for Northern Kautokeino, Northern Karasjok, Tana and Nesseby. * East Norwegian ** Vikv\u00e6r Norwegian (Vestfold, \u00d8stfold, and adjacent lowland parts of Telemark, Buskerud , Oslo and Akershus) ** Middle East Norwegian (Ringerike and Romerike ** Oppland Norwegian (southern Hedmark and south-eastern Oppland) ** \u00d8sterdal Norwegian (northern Hedmark and Bardu in northern Norway) * Midland Norwegian ** Gudbrandsdal Norwegian (northern Oppland) ** Valdres and Hallingdal Norwegian (south-west Oppland and western Buskerud) ** Western Telemark Norwegian (Vinje, Tokke and Kviteseid) ** Eastern Telemark Norwegian (Tinn, Hjartdal, and upper Numedal) * Tr\u00f8ndelag Norwegian ** Outer Tr\u00f8ndelag Norwegian (Nordm\u00f8re, outer S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag, and Fosen) ** Inner Tr\u00f8ndelag Norwegian (inner S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag, Innherad, Lierne, and Sn\u00e5sa) ** Namdal Norwegian (Namdalen and surrounding coastal areas) ** South-eastern Tr\u00f8ndersk (R\u00f8ros, Selbu, Tydal, Holt\u00e5len, Oppdal) == Dialect branches == * National Norwegian ** (Northern Norway) *** (Bod\u00f8) *** Br\u00f8nn\u00f8y dialect (Br\u00f8nn\u00f8y) *** (Helgeland) *** other dialects ** Tr\u00f8ndersk (Tr\u00f8ndelag) *** (Fosen) *** (H\u00e4rjedalen) *** J\u00e4mtland dialects (J\u00e4mtland province) *** Meldal dialect (Meldal) *** (Tydal) *** other dialects ** Vestlandsk (Western and Southern Norway) *** West (Vestlandet) **** Bergen dialect (Bergen) **** (Haugesund) **** (J\u00e6ren district) **** (Karm\u00f8y) **** (Nordm\u00f8re) ***** (Sunndals\u00f8ra) **** (Romsdal) **** Sandnes dialect (Sandnes) **** Sogn dialect (Sogn district) **** (Sunnm\u00f8re) **** Stavanger dialect (Stavanger) **** (Midhordland district) *** South (S\u00f8rlandet) **** Arendal dialect (Arendal region) **** (Upper Setesdal, Valle) *** other dialects ** (Eastern Norway) *** (Lowland districts) ****Vikv\u00e6rsk dialects (Viken district) ***** (Andebu) ***** (Bohusl\u00e4n province) ***** (Grenland district) ***** Oslo dialect (Oslo) **** (Mid-east districts) ***** (Ringerike district) ****** (H\u00f8nefoss) ****** (\u00c5dal) ****** (Modum) **** (Opplandene district) ***** Hedmark dialects (Hedmark) ****** (Sol\u00f8r) **** (Hadeland district) **** (Viken district) ***** S\u00e4rna-Idre dialect (S\u00e4rna and Idre) *** (Midland districts) **** Gudbrandsdal dialect (Gudbrandsdalen, Oppland and Upper Folldal, Hedmark) **** Hallingdal- Valdres dialects (Hallingdal, Valdres) ***** ***** Valdris dialect (Valdres district) **** Telemark-Numedal dialects (Telemark and Numedal) ***** *** other dialects == Evolution == Owing to geography and climate, Norwegian communities were often isolated from each other until the early 20th century. As a result, local dialects had a tendency to be influenced by each other in singular ways while developing their own idiosyncrasies. The community of Oppdal, for example, has characteristics in common with coastal dialects to the west, the dialects of northern Gudbrandsdalen to the south, and other dialects in S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag from the north. The linguist Einar Haugen documented the particulars of the Oppdal dialect, and the writer Inge Krokann used it as a literary device. Other transitional dialects include the dialects of Romsdal and Arendal. On the other hand, newly industrialized communities near sources of hydroelectric power have developed dialects consistent with the region but in many ways unique. Studies in such places as H\u00f8yanger, Odda, Tyssedal, Rjukan, Notodden, Sauda, and others show that creolization has effected the formation of new dialects in these areas. Similarly, in the early 20th century a dialect closely approximating standard Bokm\u00e5l arose in and around railway stations. This was known as stasjonsspr\u00e5k (\"station language\") and may have contributed to changes in dialect around these centers. == Social dynamics == Until the 20th century, upward social mobility in a city like Oslo could in some cases require conforming speech to standard Riksm\u00e5l. Studies show that even today, speakers of rural dialects may tend to change their usage in formal settings to approximate the formal written language. This has led to various countercultural movements ranging from the adoption of radical forms of Oslo dialects among political radicals in Oslo, to movements preserving local dialects. There is widespread and growing acceptance that Norwegian linguistic diversity is worth preserving. The trend today is a regionalisation of the dialects causing smaller dialectal traits to disappear and rural dialects to merge with their nearest larger dialectal variety. There is no standard dialect for the Norwegian language as a whole, and all dialects are by now mutually intelligible. Hence, widely different dialects are used frequently and alongside each other, in almost every aspect of society. Criticism of a dialect may be considered criticism of someone's personal identity and place of upbringing, and is considered impolite. Not using one's proper dialect would be bordering on awkward in many situations, as it may signal a wish to take on an identity or a background which one does not have. Dialects are also an area from which to derive humour both in professional and household situations. == Distinctions == There are many ways to distinguish among Norwegian dialects. These criteria are drawn from the work of Egil B\u00f8rre Johnsen (ed.) (1987) V\u00e5rt Eget Spr\u00e5k/Talem\u00e5let, H. Aschehoug & Co. . These criteria generally provide the analytical means for identifying most dialects, though most Norwegians rely on experience to tell them apart. === Grammars and syntax === ==== Infinitive forms ==== One of the most important differences among dialects is which ending, if any, verbs have in the infinitive form. In Old Norwegian, most verbs had an infinitive ending (-a), and likewise in a modern Norwegian dialect, most of the verbs of the dialect either have or would have had an infinitive ending. There are five varieties of the infinitive ending in Norwegian dialects, constituting two groups: One ending (western dialects) * Infinitive ending with -a, e.g., \u00e5 vera, \u00e5 bita, common in southwestern Norway, including the areas surrounding Bergen (although not in the city of Bergen itself) and Stavanger * Infinitive ending with -e, e.g., \u00e5 v\u00e6re, \u00e5 bite, common in Troms, Finnmark, areas of Sogn og Fjordane and M\u00f8re og Romsdal, Southern counties, and a few other areas. * Apocopic infinitive, where no vowel is added to the infinitive form, e.g., \u00e5 v\u00e6r, \u00e5 bit, common in certain areas of Nordland Two different endings (eastern dialects) * Split infinitive, in which some verbs end with -a while others end with -e; e.g. \u00e5 v\u00e6ra versus \u00e5 bite, common in Eastern Norway * Split infinitive, with apocope, e.g., \u00e5 v\u00e6ra (v\u00e6rra/v\u00e5rr\u00e5/varra) versus \u00e5 bit, common in some areas in S\u00f8r- Tr\u00f8ndelag and Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag The split distribution of endings is related to the syllable length of the verb in Old Norse. \"Short-syllable\" (kortstava) verbs in Norse kept their endings. The \"long-syllable\" (langstava) verbs lost their (unstressed) endings or had them converted to -e. ==== Dative case ==== The original Germanic contextual difference between the dative and accusative cases, standardized in modern German and Icelandic, has degenerated in spoken Danish and Swedish, a tendency which spread to Bokm\u00e5l too. Ivar Aasen treated the dative case in detail in his work, Norsk Grammatik (1848), and use of Norwegian dative as a living grammatical case can be found in a few of the earliest Landsm\u00e5l texts. However, the dative case has never been part of official Landsm\u00e5l/Nynorsk. It is, however, present in some spoken dialects north of Oslo, Romsdal, and south and northeast of Trondheim. The grammatical phenomenon is highly threatened in the mentioned areas, while most speakers of conservative varieties have been highly influenced by the national standard languages, using only the traditional accusative word form in both cases. Often, though not always, the difference in meaning between the dative and accusative word forms can thus be lost, requiring the speaker to add more words to specify what was actually meant, to avoid potential loss of information. ==== Future tense ==== There are regional variations in the use of future tense, for example, \"He is going to travel.\": : Han kommer/kjem til \u00e5 reise. : Han blir \u00e5 reise. : Han blir reisan. : Han skal reise. ==== Syntax ==== Syntax can vary greatly between dialects, and the tense is important for the listener to get the meaning. For instance, a question can be formed without the traditional \"asking-words\" (how, where, what, who..) For example, the sentence Hvor mye er klokken? (in Bokm\u00e5l), Kor mykje er klokka? (in Nynorsk), literally: \"How much is the clock?\" i.e. \"What time is it?\" can be put in, among others, the following forms: : E klokka mykje? (Is the clock much?) (stress is on \"the clock\") : E a mytti, klokka? (Is it much, the clock?) (stress on \"is\") : Ka e klokka? (literally: \"What is the clock?\") : Ka klokka e? (literally: What the clock is?), or, using another word for clock, Ke ure' e? : \u00c5 er 'o? (literally: What is she?). === Pronunciation of vowels === ==== Diphthongization of monophthongs ==== Old Norse had the diphthongs , , and , but the Norwegian spoken in the area around Setesdal has shifted two of the traditional diphthongs and innovated four more from long vowels, and, in some cases, also short vowels. Authors state that the Setesdal dialect is \"perhaps the most distinctive and most difficult to understand\" among all Norwegian dialects. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" ! rowspan=2 | Old Norse ! Modern Norwegian |- ! SetesdalTo hear them pronounced, go to The section Uttale av vokalane needs to be selected manually. |- | | |- | | |- | | |- | | |- | | |- | | |} West Norwegian dialects have also innovated new diphthongs. In Midtre you can find the following: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" ! rowspan=2 | Old Norse ! Modern Norwegian |- ! Midtre |- | | |- | | |- | | |} ==== Monophthongization of diphthongs ==== The Old Norse diphthongs , , and have experienced monophthongization in certain dialects of modern Norwegian. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" ! rowspan=2 | Old Norse ! colspan=2 | Modern Norwegian |- ! Urban East ! Some dialects |- | | | |- | | | |- | | | |} This shift originated in Old East Norse, which is reflected in the fact that Swedish and Danish overwhelmingly exhibit this change. Monophthongization in Norway ends on the coast west of Trondheim and extends southeast in a triangle into central Sweden. Some Norwegian dialects, east of Molde, for example, have lost only and . ==== Leveling ==== (Jamning/Jevning in Norwegian) This is a phenomenon in which the root vowel and end vowel in a word approximate each other. For example, the old Norse viku has become v\u00e5kk\u00e5 or vukku in certain dialects. There are two varieties in Norwegian dialects \u2013 one in which the two vowels become identical, the other where they are only similar. Leveling exists only in inland areas in Southern Norway, and areas around Trondheim. ==== Vowel shift in strong verbs ==== In all but Oslo and coastal areas just south of the capital, the present tense of certain verbs take on a new vowel (umlaut), e.g., \u00e5 fare becomes fer (in Oslo, it becomes farer). === Pronunciation of consonants === ==== Eliminating in the plural indefinite form ==== In some areas, the is not pronounced in all or some words in their plural indefinite form. There are four categories: * The is retained \u2013 most of Eastern Norway, the South-Eastern coast, and across to areas north and east of Stavanger. * The disappears altogether \u2013 Southern tip of Norway, coastal areas north of Bergen, and inland almost to Trondheim. * The is retained in certain words but not in others \u2013 coastal areas around Trondheim, and most of Northern Norway * The is retained in certain words and in weak feminine nouns, but not in others \u2013 one coast area in Nordland. ==== Phonetic realization of ==== Most dialects realize as the alveolar tap or alveolar trill . However, for the last 200 years the uvular approximant has been gaining ground in Western and Southern Norwegian dialects, with Kristiansand, Stavanger, and Bergen as centers. The uvular R has also been adopted in aspiring patricians in and around Oslo, to the point that it was for some time fashionable to \"import\" governesses from the Kristiansand area. In certain regions, such as Oslo, the flap has become realized as a retroflex flap (generally called \"thick L\") , which exists only in Norway, a few regions in Sweden, and in completely unrelated languages. The sound coexists with other retroflexions in Norwegian dialects. In some areas it also applies to words that end with \"rd,\" for example with \"gard\" (farm) being pronounced . The uvular R has gained less acceptance in eastern regions, and linguists speculate that dialects that use retroflexes have a \"natural defense\" against uvular R and thus will not adopt it. However, the dialect of Arendal retains the retroflexes, while featuring the uvular R in remaining positions, e.g. rart ==== Palatalization ==== In areas north of an isogloss running between Oslo and Bergen, palatalization occurs for the n (IPA ), l (), t () and d () sounds in varying degrees. Areas just south and southwest of Trondheim palatalize both the main and subordinate syllable in words (e.g., ), but other areas only palatalize the main syllable (). ==== Voicing of plosives ==== Voiceless stops () have become voiced () intervocalically after long vowels (, vs. , ) on the extreme southern coast of Norway, including Kristiansand, Mandal and Stavanger. The same phenomenon appears in S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag and one area in Nordland. ==== Segmentation ==== The geminate in southwestern Norway has become , while just east in southcentral Norwegian the final is lost, leaving . The same sequence has been palatalized in Northern Norway, leaving the palatal lateral . ==== Assimilation ==== The second consonant in the consonant clusters , , and has assimilated to the first across most of Norway, leaving , , and respectively. Western Norway, though not in Bergen, retains the cluster. In Northern Norway this same cluster is realized as the palatal lateral . ==== Consonant shift in conjugation of masculine nouns ==== Although used less frequently, a subtle shift takes place in conjugating a masculine noun from indefinitive to definitive, e.g., from bekk to bekkjen (, [be\u00e7\u02d0en] or ). This is found in rural dialects along the coast from Farsund to the border between Troms and Finnmark. ==== The kj - sj merger ==== Many people, especially in the younger generation, have lost the differentiation between the (written ) and (written ) sounds, realizing both as . This is by many considered to be a normal development in language change (although as most language changes, the older generation and more conservative language users often lament the degradation of the language). The functional load (the sum total of words that use this - distinction) is relatively small, and as often happens, similar sounds with small functional loads merge. === Tonemes and intonation === There are great differences between the intonation systems of different Norwegian dialects. === Vocabulary === ==== First person pronoun, nominative plural ==== Three variations of the first person plural nominative pronoun exist in Norwegian dialects: * Vi, (pronounced ), common in parts of Eastern Norway, most of Northern Norway, coastal areas close to Trondheim, and one sliver of Western Norway * Me, m\u00f8 or mi, in Southern and most of Western Norway, areas inland of Trondheim, and a few smaller areas * Oss, common in areas of S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag, Gudbrandsdalen, Nordm\u00f8re and parts of Sunnm\u00f8re. ==== First person pronoun, nominative singular ==== There is considerable variety in the way the first person singular nominative pronoun is pronounced in Norwegian dialects. They appear to fall into three groups, within which there are also variations: * E(g) and \u00e6(i)(g), in which the hard 'g' may or may not be included. This is common in most of Southern and Western Norway, Tr\u00f8ndelag, and most of Northern Norway. Some places in Western Norway, it's common to say \"Ej\". * I (pronounced ), in a few areas in Western Norway (Romsdal/Molde) and Sn\u00e5sa in Nord Tr\u00f8ndelag * J\u00e9 , j\u00e8 , or jei , in areas around Oslo, and north along the Swedish border, almost to Trondheim, as well as one region in Troms ==== Personal pronouns ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
