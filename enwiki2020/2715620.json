The various Serbian principalities and kingdoms were organised around a number of different royal dynasties. Many of these invested in symbols of royalty which has led to a number of distinctive crowns, jewels and other treasures of incredible wealth surviving to the present day. As far as is known, there are four royal crowns once worn by Serbian kings or princes that have survived to the present day, of which just one is kept in the modern Republic of Serbia today. ==Nemanji\u0107 Crowns== The Nemanji\u0107 Crown Jewels are the oldest of the surviving pieces of Serbian royal regalia. They were used in the coronation ceremonies of members of the medieval House of Nemanji\u0107. The 14th Century Crown of King Stephen III is kept at Cetinje Monastery in the Republic of Montenegro.Cetinje Another crown which had once belonged to medieval Serbian rulers is kept in the Kaiserliche Schatzkammer (Imperial Treasury) in Vienna, Austria. Also, at the Kaiserliche Schatzkammer are found two further crowns once worn by members of the medieval Nemanji\u0107 dynasty; one of which was later attributed to Stephen Bocskai. Together with these is a golden mantle (buckle) of unknown origin which is believed to have been captured by the Serbs from the Ottomans at Brasov. ==Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 Crown== The Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 Crown Jewels were created in 1904 for the coronation of King Peter I. The pieces were made from materials that included bronze taken from the cannon Kara\u0111or\u0111e used during the First Serbian Uprising. This gesture was symbolic because 1904 was the 100th anniversary of that uprising. The regalia was made in Paris by the famous Falise brothers jewellery company and is currently the only Serbian crown kept in the territory of the Republic of Serbia. ==Regalia== The Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 Serbian Royal Regalia consist of the following: *Royal crown (Also known as the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 Crown), with details such as the Serbian coat of arms *Royal orb *Royal scepter *Royal mantle buckle *Royal mantle The crown, scepter, and orb are decorated with gemstones found in Serbia and enameled in the national colours of red, blue, and white. The royal mantle is made of purple velvet, embroidered with gold and lined with ermine fur. ==Gallery== File:KrunaKaradjordjevica.jpg|Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 Crown File:Two-Headed Eagle from Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 crown.jpg|Coat of arms of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 on the crown File:King Peter I after coronation, 21 September 1904.jpg|King Peter I wearing the regalia File:King Peter I of serbia - coronation.jpg|King Peter I's coronation (1904) File:Royal Coat of arms of Serbia (1882\u20131918).svg|Coat of arms of the Kingdom of Serbia ==See also== *History of Serbia *List of Serbian monarchs *Kingdom of Serbia *Serbian Empire ==References== ==External links== *Official Website Category:Crowns (headgear) Serbia Category:National symbols of Serbia Category:National symbols of Yugoslavia Category:Serbian monarchy ",
