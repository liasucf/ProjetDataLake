At the age of eighteen months, an undiagnosed viral infection resulted in her developing motor neuropathy in her trunk and legs. Williams holds dual nationality as an Irish national having inherited this from her mother's Irish citizenship. She attended Altrincham Grammar School for Girls and proceeded to graduate with a first class honours Bachelor of Science degree in social psychology from Loughborough University. \"There were loads of different reasons for coming to Loughborough University,\" she explained. \"The course was one of them; it\u2019s one of the only universities in the country that does social psychology and that was important for me. The sport as well, obviously. I applied for the 2012 scholarship and got it and the facilities are really good. But the atmosphere was also a big factor. It\u2019s one of the best student experience universities in the country.\" Immediately following her studies at Loughborough, Williams pursued postgraduate education at the University of Alabama, graduating with a Master of Science degree in Human Development Studies. ==Sporting career== When she was 13, Williams began wheelchair athletics and wheelchair racing. While attending the Greater Manchester Youth Games in 2005, she was asked to try out for wheelchair basketball. She found that she loved the physicality of the game and the social aspects of being part of a team, and started playing competitively in 2008. Her team mates called her \"whippet\" on account of her speed on the basketball court. She played for the Nottingham Coyotes in the National League and is classified as a 2.5 point player. In 2009 Williams made her debut with Team Great Britain at the 2009 BT Paralympic World Cup in Manchester, and in 2010 was part of the team that came sixth at the World Championships in Birmingham \u2013 Britain's best ever performance. She was then part of the team that won silver at the U22 European Championships in Italy later that year. She won bronze at the European Championships in Nazareth in 2011 and Frankfurt in 2013, and at the U25 World Championship in St. Catharines, Canada in 2011. She made her Paralympic debut in front of a home crowd at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. Whilst studying at University of Alabama, Williams was part of the university wheelchair basketball team, and participated in their successfully winning their fourth National Championship in seven years in 2015, with a 58\u201352 win over the University of Illinois. In 2015 she was co-captain (with Amy Conroy) of the U25 team at the 2015 Women's U25 Wheelchair Basketball World Championship in Beijing, winning gold. She then played with the senior team that defeated France to take bronze in the 2015 European Championship.
