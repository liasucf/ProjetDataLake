It was performed in New York City in 1980 and 1983, and spawned an ongoing comics series and audioplays. == Plot == In a distant future, humanity has spread across the stars. In the wake of a toppled galactic dictator, a period of freeform chaos exists with factions from every side vying for control. The United Federation of Female Freedom Fighters have sent Captain Galatia 9 and her compatriots to ensure the safety of Glorianna, a charismatic leader who may tip the balance toward a just society. But Glorianna has been kidnapped by the villains on the ship Siren 3, commanded by Galatia's lifelong nemesis, Verloona Ti. The struggle between the two ships and their eccentric crews will decide the future of the universe. == Characters == * Captain Galatia 9: The swashbuckling captain of the Female Freedom Fighter ship, the Harpy. * Brucilla the Muscle: The hotheaded mechanic, fighter, and pilot * Erotica Ann: The brilliant brain trapped in a sex droid body. * Sister Bronwyn of the Cosmic Veil: A befuddled psychic nun. * EEEEEEEEEluh: A merwoman empath. * Verloona Ti: Leader of the villains, captain of the Siren 3. * Kalif Bajar: A fallen aristocrat and schemer. * Rah El Rex: A schizoid dandy. * Orga the Killer Cyborg: A beast enslaved by Verloona. * Norm: The computer for the Siren 3. * Dwannyun: A villain wanna-be who tries out as Zun the Warlord, Grad the Illegible, and Captain Chaos. == Background and creation == Elaine Lee earned a 1980 Daytime Emmy nomination for best supporting actress on NBC's soap opera \"The Doctors\". She then created the Wild Hair production company in Manhattan as an outlet for stronger roles for female actors. With her sister, Susan Norfleet Lee, she co-wrote two plays that they produced and starred in with their company: \"Brief Cases\" and \"The Contamination of the Kokomo Lounge\". The third play, \"Starstruck: A Space Opera\", was written by Elaine Lee, with dialogue contributions from Susan Norfleet Lee and Dale Place, as a parody and tribute to science-fiction cliches. Elaine Lee attributes the huge success of Star Wars, a lifetime of 50's and 60's science fiction movies, feminist science fiction novels, and a predominantly female cast as major influences on her approach to the script.Susan Adamo. \"Starstruck: Artist Mike Kaluta's Designs For This SF-Comedy Satire\".
