    "text": "Nebraska map showing location of Pawnee Reservation and other Indian territories in 1873 The Pawnee Reservation in Nebraska was located on the Loup River in Platte and Nance counties in mid-central Nebraska. The Kawarakis Pawnees, the ancestors of the Chaui, Kitkehahki, and Pitahawirata Bands, settled in southeastern Nebraska in approximately 900. Under three treaties with the United States in 1833, 1843, and 1857, the Pawnee ceded all of their lands to the United States government except a reservation wide by long along the Loup River in Nebraska. After the state of Nebraska was admitted into the Union, the state government extinguished the tribe's rights to their land. It soon sold the land and used the proceeds to defray expenses to obtain lands elsewhere for the Indians.(1902) \"Kennard v. State of Nebraska, 186 U.S. 304 (1902)\", FindLaw. Retrieved 11/29/08. In the mid-1870s the remainder of the reservation was sold, and in 1876 the tribe was relocated to its present-day location in central Oklahoma.\"History-Introduction\", Pawnee Nation.
