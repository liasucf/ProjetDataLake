Mount Narthacium () was a mountain famed in the mythology and history of ancient Thessaly. Taking its name from the nearby ancient town of Narthacium, nearby was the scene of a battle where Agesilaus, on his return from Asia in 394 BCE, gained a victory over the Thessalian cavalry. The Thessalians, after their defeat, took refuge on Mount Narthacium, between which and a place named Pras, Agesilaus set up a trophy. On the following day he crossed the mountains of the Achaean Phthiotis.Xenophon, Ages. 2.3-5.Plutarch, Apophth. p. 211 The ancient town of Pharsalus was built on its northern slopes. The legendary city of Phthia also stood on its flank. ==References== Category:Geography of ancient Thessaly Narthacium ",
