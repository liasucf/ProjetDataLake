On 23 June 1941, Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen's 8th Air Corps decimated the corps, operating as part of Western Front, when the 6th Cavalry Corps attempted a counterattack near Grodno. Richthofen threw all available aircraft at the thrust and played a vital role in its defeat. The Soviet corps suffered 50 per cent casualties, mostly from air attack. Richthofen's 8th Air Corps claimed 30 tanks, and 50 motor vehicles in 500 sorties. == Organization == * 4th Cavalry Division * 6th Cavalry Division * 11th Cavalry Division == References== === Citations === === Bibliography === * Category:Cavalry Corps (Soviet Union) Category:Soviet invasion of Poland ",
