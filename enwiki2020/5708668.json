    "text": "Behea or Bihiya is a nagar panchayat town in Bhojpur district in the Indian state of Bihar, as well as an associated sub-district. The sub-district comprises 76 rural villages, along with the town of Bihiya itself and 22 uninhabited villages. As of 2011, the population of the sub-district was 151,722, of whom 26,707 lived in the town of Bihiya itself. ==History== A branch of the Harihoban Rajputs once ruled Bihiya. According to tradition, in 1528, the scion of the Bihiya Harihobans, whose name is given as either Ram Pal Singh or Bhopat Deo, raped a local Brahmin woman named Mathin or Mahini, in line with the custom of \"taking of dola\", which allowed the local Rajput lord to sleep with a lower-caste woman on her wedding night. Mathin then committed suicide, but not before laying a curse upon the Harihobans, who eventually left Bihiya and moved to Ballia across the Ganges. A temple called the Mathin Dai was built in Bihiya in her memory. This legend still resonates with women of the region, especially Dalit women, as it encapsulates the sexual violence long perpetrated by upper-caste men against lower-caste women. When The Imperial Gazetteer of India was published in 1885, it mentioned the existence of Bihiya as a village of Shahabad district, with a station on the East Indian Railway. Bihiya was mentioned as being a center of local trade. A Bihiya Canal was also described, branching off from the Arrah Canal. Bihiya was first listed as a nagar panchayat town in the 1980s. ==Demographics== As of the 2001 census, the population was approximately 25,000, of which 17% were below age 6.
