    "text": "Chai Lifeline is a chesed organization founded in 1987 by Rabbi Simcha Scholar to help families with \"children battling a deadly disease.\" Although they have professional staff, much of their work depends on volunteers, whose ranks include those who, in their younger years, received services and survived. Their goal is to \"restore the light of childhood to children whose innocence ended when life-threatening or lifelong illness was diagnosed.\" While most Chai Lifeline programs operate year-round, their upstate NY summer program \"for children with catastrophic illnesses\" helps \"Jewish children from around the world.\"(Camp Simcha) ==History== Scholar's initial guidance was from Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, and the focus was Jewish pediatric cancer patients in the NYC area. By 1990, they had offices in Florida and Jerusalem, with another planned for California. Subsequent expansion included services to other major Jewish areas such as Baltimore and the West Coast. Their Los Angeles office was described as \"provides services to .. families of all Jewish denominations\" and \"depends on foundation and individual donations.\" ===Mission Expansion=== Yeshiva University hosted the first university-based Shabbaton to give exposure and training for Chai Lifeline college-age volunteers, under a Fighting Illness With Love banner. As of 2015 their first (2008) Canadian outreach still seemed limited to Montreal, like Federation CJA, with whom they affiliated. By 2018 the Toronto Star had reported the expansion of Chai Lifeline Canada to Toronto and somewhat beyond. By 2012, small scale Chai Lifeline groups had begun in UK and Belgium, with support from the New York-based main office's professionals. ==Services== While not all services were available in all locations as of 2015, some of the programs offered by a blend of professionalsdegrees among various articles include MD, MSW, LSW and volunteers are: *i-Shine: an after-school program for \"support to siblings of sick children, children living with an ill parent, and those living with untimely loss in their homes\" ==Camp Simcha== Camp Simcha is a campus located in Glen Spey, NY.San Diego Jewish Journal: Special Camps for Special Kids NY that offers children with cancer a chance to enjoy traditional camp activities. Besides mini-golf, arts & crafts workshops, modified sports, color war, and talent shows there are helicopter rides and concerts. An innovative swimming pool ramp and water-submersible wheelchairs enables more children to enjoy swimming. They have a motorboat, paddle and bumper boats, and a pontoon boat capable of holding an entire bunk, including wheelchair- dependent children. The camp program is directed by Dr. Peter Steinherz and an entire team of oncologists, pediatric oncology nurses, EMTs, social workers and physical therapists. In case of emergencies, an acute transport ambulance is on-site at all times, and accompanies campers on any trips. A Medevac helicopter is on call, and can reach the camp within five minutes. ===Camp Simcha Special=== Camp Simcha Special was created in 2001 to meet the medical and social needs of children and teens with disabilities, chronic diseases, or genetic diseases.
