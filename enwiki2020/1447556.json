Lockhart, William J. DuikerThe A to Z of Vietnam p374 Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o commanded the Vietnamese armies that repelled two out of three major Mongol invasions in late 13th century.The Tran Dynasty and the Defeat of the Mongols His multiple victories over the Yuan Dynasty under Kublai Khan are considered among the greatest military feats in Vietnamese history. ==Origins== Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o was born as Prince Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c Tu\u1ea5n (\u9673\u570b\u5cfb) in 1228 to Prince Tr\u1ea7n Li\u1ec5u, the elder brother of the new child emperor, Tr\u1ea7n Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng, after the Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty replaced the L\u00fd family in 1225 AD. Some time later, Tr\u1ea7n Li\u1ec5u-- the Empress L\u00fd Chi\u00eau Ho\u00e0ng\u2019s brother-in-law at the time-- was forced to defer his own wife (Princess Thu\u1eadn Thi\u00ean) to his younger brother Emperor Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng under pressure from Imperial Regent Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ed9 to solidify Tr\u1ea7n clan\u2019s dynastic stability. The brothers Tr\u1ea7n Li\u1ec5u and Emperor Tr\u1ea7n Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng harboured grudges against their uncle Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ed9 for the forced marital arrangement. Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c Tu\u1ea5n, his father Tr\u1ea7n Li\u1ec5u, and Emperor Tr\u1ea7n Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng had a very close relationship. Li\u1ec5u would find great tutors to teach his son, Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c Tu\u1ea5n, with the hope of one day becoming a great leader of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t and regain his family honour. On his deathbed, Li\u1ec5u told his son to avenge what he felt was personal shame forced upon him and his brother, Tr\u1ea7n Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng, by the Imperial Regent Tran Thu Do. ==The first Mongol invasion== During the first Mongol invasion of Vietnam in 1258, Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o served as an officer commanding troops on the frontier. ==The second Mongol invasion== In 1285, Kublai Khan demanded passage through \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t for his Yuan army in order to invade of the Kingdom of Champa (the Central of modern-day Viet Nam). When the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t government refused, the Mongol army, led by Prince Toghan, attacked \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t and captured the imperial capital Th\u0103ng Long (modern day Hanoi). The Emperor Emeritus Tr\u1ea7n Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng and Emperor Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng appointed Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o as the Commander-in-chief of the armies (Qu\u1ed1c c\u00f4ng ti\u1ebft ch\u1ebf th\u1ed1ng l\u0129nh ch\u01b0 qu\u00e2n). The prince of H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o initially built defensive lines the frontier areas, but those were rapidly broken by Toghan's armies. It was in that episode that his loyal servant, Y\u1ebft Ki\u00eau, saved him from being nearly captured by the Mongols. Then he retreated to V\u1ea1n Ki\u1ebfp, where he had a discussion with Emperor Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng. The two agreed to call 200.000 troops from north-east areas to assemble in V\u1ea1n Ki\u1ebfp. Here, on 11 February 1285, Viet navy under the direct commander of the emperor and the prince of H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o fought a huge battle with Toghan's fleet. The Yuan fleet suffered heavily but they managed to win the battle. Emperor Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng and Prince of H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o eventually retreated to the imperial capital, Th\u0103ng Long. The Yuan forces pursued to Th\u0103ng Long and broke its defenses; however, the prince of H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o's troops kept the enemy at bay long enough for the two emperors to escape from the city with the imperial family and the bulk of the army. The prince of H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o and other generals escorted the royal family, staying just ahead of the Mongol army in hot pursuit. The Yuan army effectively controlled most of Annam, and surrounded the remaining Dai Viet leadership on land; however the latter fled to an island. Despite their martial success, the Yuan forces struggled greatly with heat and disease. As a result, the Yuan forces again retreated to wait until colder weather.Descending Dragon, Rising Tiger: A History of Vietnam By Vu Hong Lien, Peter Sharrock Then Viet forces, divided into field armies commanded by the two emperors; Grand Chancellor Tr\u1ea7n Quang Kh\u1ea3i, Grand Prince of Chi\u00eau Minh; Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u1eadt Du\u1eadt, Prince of Chi\u00eau V\u0103n; and Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c Tu\u1ea5n, Prince of H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o conducted highly effective counterattacks, killing many Yuan generals like Sogetu. ==The third Mongol invasion== In 1287, Kublai Khan this time sent one of his favorite sons, Prince Toghan to lead another invasion campaign into \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t with a determination to occupy and redeem the previous defeat. The Yuan Mongol and Chinese forces formed an even larger infantry, cavalry and naval fleet with the total strength estimated at 500,000 men according to the [need an original accounting of a source or book] original Viet history. During the first stage of the invasion, the Mongols quickly defeated most of the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t troops that were stationed along the border. Prince Toghan's naval fleet devastated most of the naval force of General Tr\u1ea7n Kh\u00e1nh D\u01b0 in V\u00e2n \u0110\u1ed3n. Simultaneously, Prince Ariq-Qaya led his massive cavalry and captured Ph\u00fa L\u01b0\u01a1ng and \u0110\u1ea1i Than garrisons, two strategic military posts bordering \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t and China. The cavalry later rendezvous with Prince Toghan's navy in V\u00e2n \u0110\u1ed3n. In response to the battle skirmish defeats at the hands of the Mongol forces, the Emperor Emeritus Tr\u1ea7n Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng summoned General Tr\u1ea7n Kh\u00e1nh D\u01b0 to be court-martialed for military failures, but the general managed to delayed reporting to the court and was able to regrouped his forces in V\u00e2n \u0110\u1ed3n. The cavalry and fleet of Prince Toghan continued to advance into the imperial capital Th\u0103ng Long. Meanwhile, the trailing supply fleet of Prince Toghan, arriving at V\u00e2n \u0110\u1ed3n a few days after General Tr\u1ea7n Kh\u00e1nh D\u01b0's had already occupied this strategic garrison, the Mongol supply fleet was ambushed and captured by General Tr\u1ea7n Kh\u00e1nh D\u01b0's forces. Kh\u00e1nh D\u01b0 was then pardoned by the Emperor Emeritus. The Mongol main occupying army quickly realized their support and supply fleet has been cut off. The capture of the Mongol supply fleet at V\u00e2n \u0110\u1ed3n along with the concurring news that General Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o had recaptured \u0110\u1ea1i Than garrison in the north sent the fast advancing Mongol forces into chaos. The \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t forces unleashed guerrilla warfare on the weakened Mongol forces causing heavy casualties and destructions to the Yuan forces. However, the Mongols continued advancing into Th\u0103ng Long due to their massive cavalry strength, but by this time, the emperor decided to vacate Th\u0103ng Long to flee and he ordered the capital to be burned down so the Mongols wouldn't collect any spoils of war. The subsequent battle skirmishes between the Mongols and \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t had mixed results: the Mongols won and captured Y\u00ean H\u01b0ng and Long H\u01b0ng provinces, but lost in the naval battles at \u0110\u1ea1i B\u00e0ng. Eventually, Prince Toghan decided to withdraw his naval fleet and consolidated his command on land battles where he felt the Mongol's superior cavalry would defeat the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t infantry and cavalry forces. Toghan led the cavalry through N\u1ed9i B\u00e0ng while his naval fleet commander, Omar, directly launched the naval force along the B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng River simultaneously. ===The Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng River=== The Mongol naval fleet were unaware of the river's terrain. Days before this expedition, the Prince of H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o predicted the Mongol's naval route and quickly deployed heavy unconventional traps of steel-tipped wooden stakes unseen during high tides along the B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng River bed. When Omar ordered the Mongol fleet to retreat from the river, the Viet deployed smaller and more maneuverable vessels into agitating and luring the Mongol vessels into the riverside where the booby traps were waiting while it was still high tide. As the river tide on B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng River receded, the Mongol vessels were stuck and sunk by the embedded steel-tipped stakes. Under the presence of the Emperor Emeritus Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng and Emperor Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng, the Viet forces led by the Prince of H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o burned down an estimated 400 large Mongol vessels and captured the remaining naval crew along the river. The entire Mongol fleet was destroyed and the Mongol fleet admiral Omar was captured. The cavalry force of Prince Toghan was more fortunate. They were ambushed along the road through N\u1ed9i B\u00e0ng, but his remaining force managed to escape back to China by dividing their forces into smaller retreating groups but most were captured or killed in skirmishes on the way back to the border frontier. ==Death== Statue of Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o in Quy Nh\u01a1n In 1300 AD, he fell ill and died of natural causes at the age of 73. His body was cremated and his ashes were dispersed under his favorite oak tree he planted in his royal family estate near Th\u0103ng Long in accordance to his will. The Viet intended to bury him in a lavish royal mausouleum and official ceremony upon his death, but he declined in favour of a simplistic private ceremony. For his military brilliance in defending \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t during his lifetime, The Emperor posthumously bestowed Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o the title of H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o \u0110\u1ea1i V\u01b0\u01a1ng (Grand Prince H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o). == Family == *Father: Prince Y\u00ean Sinh *Mother: Lady Thi\u1ec7n \u0110\u1ea1o *Consort: Princess Thi\u00ean Th\u00e0nh *Issues: #Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c Nghi\u1ec5n, later Prince H\u01b0ng V\u0169 #Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c Hi\u1ec7n, later Prince H\u01b0ng Tr\u00ed #Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c T\u1ea3ng, later Prince H\u01b0ng Nh\u01b0\u1ee3ng, father of Empress Consort B\u1ea3o T\u1eeb of Emperor Tr\u1ea7n Anh T\u00f4ng #Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c Uy, later Prince H\u01b0ng Hi\u1ec3n #Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb Trinh, later Empress Consort Kh\u00e2m T\u1eeb B\u1ea3o Th\u00e1nh of Emperor Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng #Empress Tuy\u00ean T\u1eeb #Princess Anh Nguy\u00ean, later wife of General Ph\u1ea1m Ng\u0169 L\u00e3o ==Legacy== ===Placenames=== The majority of cities and towns in Vietnam have central streets, wards and schools named after him.Andrea Lauser, Kirsten W.
