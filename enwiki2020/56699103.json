Among his early publications were books by Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger. The company was renamed Andr. H\u00f8st & S\u00f8n when H\u00f8st's son Peter Chr. Muusfeldt H\u00f8st (1847-1900) became a partner on 1 January 1873. By then its activities also included import of books.
