By the tournament's conclusion, the Cairns Marlins were crowned as the best male basketball club in Australia and the Townsville Flames were crowned women's champions. ==Tournament overview== The Cairns Marlins defeated the Dandenong Rangers 110\u201398 in the men's Grand Final. Nothing could split the sides in the first half but the Rangers, who finished runners-up for the second year in a row, could not contain the offensive strength of the Marlins, who had five players score 16 points or more. Cairns Taipans National Basketball League stars Aaron Grabau and Gary Boodnikoff netted 24 points and 23 points respectively to lead the Marlins with Grabau going on to be named Grand Final MVP. Future Australian Boomer Nathan Jawai also chipped in with a 21-point, 13-rebound double-double and proved to be the difference in the decisive third quarter. In the women's final, the Townsville Flames defeated the Hume City Broncos, 92\u201349. Australian Opal Rohanee Cox was outstanding for Townsville, netting a game-high 30 points while Townsville Fire Women's National Basketball League guard Celeste Heilbronn added 21 points and 9 rebounds in support. The Broncos were missing Opal Sharin Milner and Under 21 World Championship silver medalist Elyse Penaluna through injury and couldn't match the offensive power of the Flames. ==Participants== To qualify for the event, teams had to be crowned Champion of their respective Leagues. There were also a number of wildcard entries. ===League champions=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" | League || Men || Women |- | Big V || Dandenong Rangers || Hume City Broncos |- | CABL || North Adelaide Rockets || West Adelaide Bearcats |- | QABL || Cairns Marlins || Townsville Flames |- | SEABL || Bendigo Braves (South) & Geelong Supercats (East) || Bendigo Braves |- | Waratah || Sutherland Sharks || Hornsby Spiders |- |} ===Wildcards=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" | League || Men || Women |- | Big V || || Waverley Falcons |- | CABL || || Norwood Flames |- | QABL || Rockhampton Rockets || |- | SEABL || || Ballarat Miners |- | Waratah || Sydney Comets || |- |} ==Results== ===Quarter-finals \u2013 men=== ===Quarter-finals \u2013 women=== ===Semi-finals \u2013 men=== ===Semi-finals \u2013 women=== ===Grand Finals=== ==All- Star Five== ===Men=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" | Name || Team |- | Aaron Grabau (Grand Final MVP) || Cairns Marlins |- | Nathan Jawai || Cairns Marlins |- | Scott Cook || Cairns Marlins |- | Ash Cannan || Dandenong Rangers |- | Brent Hobba || Dandenong Rangers |- |} ===Women=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" | Name || Team |- | Rachael Flanagan || Townsville Flames |- | Rohanee Cox (Grand Final MVP) || Townsville Flames |- | Kristi Harrower || Bendigo Braves |- | Kellie Burbridge || Hume City Broncos |- | Naomi Pedro || Hume City Broncos |- |} ==See also== *Australian Basketball Association ==References== ==External links== *Basketball Australia 2007 Annual Report *The Road to the ABA National Finals Category:Australian Basketball Association Club ",
