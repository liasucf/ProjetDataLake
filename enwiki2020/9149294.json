    "text": "Another World is the ninth studio album by Gerry Rafferty. The album was released in 2000 on the Icon Music label to good reviews. It was re-released in 2003 on the Hypertension label with a slightly amended track order, and with \"La Fen\u00eatre\" replaced by \"Keep It To Yourself\", the latter track also being released a single in Europe and the UK. Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits appears throughout the album, providing rhythm guitar and lead fills. The album was originally only available through Gerry's website to download. ==Track listing 2000 edition== All songs were written and arranged by Gerry Rafferty, except where noted. #\"All Souls\" \u2013 5:20 #\"Land of the Chosen Few\" \u2013 5:13 #\"Sweet Surrender\" \u2013 4:02 #\"Sweet Love\" \u2013 4:27 #\"Whose House Is It Anyway?\" (Rafferty, Julian Littman) \u2013 4:31 #\"It's Better This Way\" \u2013 4:00 #\"Conscious Love\" \u2013 4:26 #\"La Fen\u00eatre\" \u2013 3:17 #\"Everytime I Wake Up\" \u2013 5:52 #\"Xavier & Honor\" \u2013 3:10 #\"You Put Something Better Inside of Me\" (Rafferty, Joe Egan) \u2013 4:53 #\"Metanoia\" \u2013 3:24 #\"Children of the Sun\" \u2013 4:04 #\"Another World\" \u2013 10:40 #*Contains the hidden track \"The Grinches\" ==Track listing 2003 edition== All songs were written and arranged by Gerry Rafferty, except where noted. #\"All Souls\" \u2013 5:20 #\"Land of the Chosen Few\" \u2013 5:13 #\"Keep It To Yourself\" \u2013 5:42 #\"Sweet Love\" \u2013 4:27 #\"Whose House Is It Anyway?\" (Rafferty, Julian Littman) \u2013 4:31 #\"It's Better This Way\" \u2013 4:00 #\"Conscious Love\" \u2013 4:26 #\"Sweet Surrender\" \u2013 4:02 #\"Everytime I Wake Up\" \u2013 5:52 #\"Xavier & Honor\" \u2013 3:10 #\"You Put Something Better Inside of Me\" (Rafferty, Joe Egan) \u2013 4:53 #\"Metanoia\" \u2013 3:24 #\"Children of the Sun\" \u2013 4:04 #\"Another World\" \u2013 10:40 #*Contains the hidden track \"The Grinches\" ==Personnel== *Gerry Rafferty \u2013 vocals, acoustic guitar, synthesizer, bass guitar, keyboards, piano, Fender Rhodes *Giles Twigg \u2013 drums, percussion, programming, bass guitar *Mel Collins \u2013 saxophone *Arran Ahmun, Dave Suttle \u2013 percussion *Cindy Legall, Tamara Marshall & Karen Griffiths \u2013 background vocals *Bryn Haworth \u2013 electric guitar, slide guitar *Julian Littman \u2013 electric guitar, accordion, background vocals *Kenny Craddock \u2013 keyboards, accordion, Hammond organ *Bryn Haworth \u2013 slide guitar, mandolin *Mark Knopfler \u2013 electric guitar, lead guitar *Mo Foster, Pino Palladino \u2013 bass guitar ==References== Category:Gerry Rafferty albums Category:2000 albums ",
