The election was the first to be contested under new ward boundaries, and as a result the entire council was up for election. The Labour Party regained control of the council, which it had lost to the Conservative Party at the previous election in 2000. ==Overall results== |- | colspan=2 style=\"text-align: right; margin-right: 1em\" | Total | style=\"text- align: right;\" | 57 | colspan=5 | | style=\"text-align: right;\" | 57,303 | style=\"text-align: right;\" | ==Ward results== ===Budshead=== Location of Budshead ward ===Compton=== Location of Compton ward ===Devonport=== Location of Devonport ward ===Drake=== Location of Drake ward ===Efford and Lipson=== Location of Efford and Lipson ward ===Eggbuckland=== Location of Eggbuckland ward ===Ham=== Location of Ham ward ===Honicknowle=== Location of Honicknowle ward ===Moor View=== Location of Moor View ward ===Peverell=== Location of Peverell ward ===Plympton Chaddlewood=== Location of Plympton Chaddlewood ward ===Plympton Erle=== Location of Plympton Erle ward ===Plympton St Mary=== Location of Plympton St Mary ward ===Plymstock Dunstone=== Location of Plymstock Dunstone ward ===Plymstock Radford=== Location of Plymstock Radford ward ===St Budeax=== Location of St Budeaux ward ===St Peter and the Waterfront=== Location of St Peter and the Waterfront ward ===Southway=== Location of Southway ward ===Stoke=== Location of Stoke ward ===Sutton and Mount Gould=== Location of Sutton and Mount Gould ward ==References== Category:2003 English local elections Category:May 2003 events in the United Kingdom 2003 Category:2000s in Devon ",
