    "text": "A whip pan is a type of pan shot in which the camera pans so quickly that the picture blurs into indistinct streaks. It is commonly used as a transition between shots, and can indicate the passage of time or a frenetic pace of action. This technique is used liberally by directors Anatole Litvak, Sam Raimi, Wes Anderson and Edgar Wright. It is also frequently seen in 1970s martial arts movies. ==See also== * Saccadic eye movement Category:Cinematography ",
