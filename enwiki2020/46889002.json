Two years later Martin joined the 2nd AIF to serve in World War II after several years serving in the Army Reserve. In September 1941 he was posted to Singapore and was commissioned as an officer a month later. He was captured in the fall of Singapore in February 1942 and was interred in the Changi Camp.
