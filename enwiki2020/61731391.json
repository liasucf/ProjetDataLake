In fact, one would give it chances only in multiplexes and even here only select audience with patience and observation might be able to fully appreciate it. Niche, is what we would like to call it. Congrats, director Krishna Shehsadri Komadam for being daringly different.\" Rediff wrote \"Commercial movie-lovers might not find this to their taste but if you're a lover of fairly realistic cinema, capturing the life of an urban metrosexual's life and times, then M3V is for you\". == References == Category:2008 films Category:Tamil-language films Category:Indian independent films Category:2008 directorial debut films Category:Indian films ",
