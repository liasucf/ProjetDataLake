    "text": "Nescau is a chocolate brand by Nestl\u00e9 which is available only in Brazil. It was launched in 1932 with the name Nesc\u00e1o. The name is a fusion between Nestl\u00e9 and \"Cac\u00e1o\"(Cacau), the word for cocoa in Brazilian Portuguese at the time. In 1954, with the orthographical reforms in Brazil, the name was changed to Nescau to avoid confusion, as people read \"Nesc\u00e1o\" as \"Nesc\u00e3o\". In 1961, the formula was changed. In 1972, the product gained a better solubility and vitamins. == Products == * Chocolate powder Nescau 2.0; * Chocolate powder Nescau Power * Chocolate powder Nescau Tradicional (discontinued) * Chocolate powder Nescau Light * Ready drink Nescau Prontinho * Ready drink Nescau Prontinho Light * Ready drink Nescau Fast * Nescau cereal * Nescau Ball chocolate * Nescau cookies. ==References== Category:Brazilian brands Category:Nestl\u00e9 brands Category:Chocolate drinks Category:Brand name dairy products ",
