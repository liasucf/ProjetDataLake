    "text": "Peter Hans Sch\u00f6nemann (July 15, 1929 \u2013 April 7, 2010) was a German born psychometrician and statistical expert. He was professor emeritus in the Department of Psychological Sciences at Purdue University. His research interests included multivariate statistics, multidimensional scaling and measurement, quantitative behavior genetics, test theory and mathematical tools for social scientists. He published around 90 papers dealing mainly with the subjects of psychometrics and mathematical scaling. Sch\u00f6nemann\u2019s influences included Louis Guttman, Lee Cronbach, Oscar Kempthorne and Henry Kaiser. Sch\u00f6nemann was a persistent critic of what he considered to be scientifically sanctioned racism in psychology. In particular, he claimed that (1) Arthur Jensen and others routinely confuse the first principal component (PC1) with g as Charles Spearman defined it, and that (2) the high IQ heritability estimates reported in the literature derive from restrictive formal models whose underlying assumptions are rarely tested and usually violated by the data.Models and muddles of heritability.

Sch\u00f6nemann (1994). Heritability. In R Sternberg (Ed.), Encyclopedia of Human Intelligence. New York: McMillan, p. 528\u2013536. ==g theory== Spearman's hypothesis asserts a correlation between the g-loadedness of IQ tests and measures of their hereditability, a concept put to work in Arthur Jensen's discussion of black--white race differences from the 1980s. Sch\u00f6nemann regarded this work as resting on a conceptual confusion. Sch\u00f6nemann argued for the non-existence of psychometric g. He wrote that there is a fundamental difference between g, first defined by Charles Spearman as a latent one-dimensional variable that accounts for all correlations among any intelligence tests, and a first principal component (PC1) of a positive correlation matrix. Spearman's tetrad difference equation states a necessary condition for such a g to exist.Famous artefacts: Spearman's Hypothesis. Cahiers de Psychologie Cognitive / Current Psychology of Cognition, 16, 665\u2013698: The important proviso for Spearman's claim that such a g qualifies as an \"objective definition\" of \"intelligence\", is that all correlation matrices of \"intelligence tests\" must satisfy this necessary condition, not just one or two, because they are all samples of a universe of tests subject to the same g. Sch\u00f6nemann argued that this condition is routinely violated by all correlation matrices of reasonable size, and thus, such a g does not exist.Psychometrics of Intelligence. K. Kemp-Leonard (ed.) Encyclopedia of Social Measurement, 3, 193\u2013201: ==Twin studies== In a number of publications, Sch\u00f6nemann argued that the statistical heritability estimates used in most twin studies rest on restrictive assumptions which are usually not tested, and if they are, often are found to be violated by the data.Sch\u00f6nemann, P. H. & Sch\u00f6nemann, R. D. (1994). Environmental versus genetic models for Osborne's personality data on identical and fraternal twins. Cahiers de Psychologie Cognitive \u2013 Current Psychology of Cognition 13, 141\u2013167: He argued that this was true for the monozygotic twins raised apart vs. together (MZT) studies (Burt, Shields, Jinks and Fulker, Bouchard) as well as for the more widely used MZT vs dizygotic twins raised together studies.Sch\u00f6nemann, P. H.(1994).Heritability. In R Sternberg (Ed.), Encyclopedia of Human Intelligence. New York: McMillan, p. 528\u2013536. For example, the narrow heritabilities of responses to the question \"did you have your back rubbed\" work out to 0.92 heritable for males and 0.21 heritable for females. Using the statistical models published in Loehlin and Nichols (1976) the question \"Did you wear sunglasses after dark?\" is 130% heritable for males and 103% for females.Totems of the IQ Myth: General Ability (g) and its Heritabilities (h2, HR). 1995 Meetings of the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences ==References== ==External links== * Sch\u00f6nemanns' publication list * Power Tables for Analysis of Variance * Alternative measures of fit for the Sch\u00f6nemann-carroll matrix fitting algorithm * Complexity, extremity, and affect in male and female judgments Category:German statisticians Category:Purdue University faculty Category:Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich alumni Category:University of G\u00f6ttingen alumni Category:University of Illinois alumni Category:Race and intelligence controversy Category:1929 births Category:2010 deaths Category:German emigrants to the United States Category:Psychometricians ",
