The brand was officially established in 2002Department of Intellectual Property, Vietnam, Decision No. 5596/QD-DK, on 31 October 2013 following application No. 4-2002-05110 on 22 August 2002 (C\u1ee5c s\u1edf h\u1eefu tr\u00ed tu\u1ec7 c\u1ea5p theo Q\u0110 s\u1ed1 5596/Q\u0110-\u0110K ng\u00e0y 31/10/2003 theo \u0111\u01a1n 4-2002-05110, ng\u00e0y n\u1ed9p l\u00e0 22/08/2002) although a variety of its products were already produced in 1997 though without official branding. S\u01a1n Tinh liquors are based on a distillate from sticky rice and consist of a clear distillate and 11 liqueurs made by maceration of Vietnamese traditional herbs, spices and fruits. The liquors are traditionally drunk straightPeters, Erica J. Appetites and Aspirations: Food and drink in the long nineteenth century 2012 Page 66 in small glasses, however the brand has introduced more modern ways to drink it; on ice, as ingredients of a cocktail or as a mixed alcoholic drink. == History == Markus Madeja, the founder and originator of the S\u01a1n Tinh liquors, is Swiss-born with a background in social anthropology and linguistics. In 1993, Markus Madeja traveled to Vietnam where his fascination with traditional handicrafts and Vietnamese culture triggered his interest in rice liquor. Like most other traditional handicrafts in North Vietnam liquor production is organized in traditional handicraft villages in which most of the inhabitants pursue the same profession.List of Vietnamese handicraft villages Markus\u2019 starting point was the village of Phu Loc in Cam Giang district of Hai Duong province where he studied the traditional way of producing rice liquor. Adopting the villagers\u2019 way of liquor production while adding modern methods of production from his native Switzerland he started a small-scale production of sticky rice liquor together with local villagers. The resulting liquor was further used to macerate traditional herbs and local fruits. The herbal recipes of S\u01a1n Tinh are inspired by traditional herbal recipes. By 1999 Markus had refined more than 20 recipes and together with his business partner, Dan Dockery, and wife, Vu Thi Thoa, opened a small liquor bar, Highway4, in Hanoi in 2000. Markus\u2019 stated goal is to \u201cpreserve a traditional Vietnamese handicraft product and not only save it from getting lost by the rapid encroachment of globalisation but bring it to a wider international audience\u201d. == Production == During the initial years of production maceration of the ingredients was done in traditional earthen jars with a volume of up to 220 litres in the home of Markus Madeja involving many manual tasks. By 2004 this way of production didn't fulfill the rising demand of the, by then two, Highway4 restaurants anymore. As a result, a new production facility was built in the village of L\u1ec7 Chi in the suburban district of Gia L\u00e2m, Hanoi. At this time distillation was switched from a traditional pot still to a modern, German-built copper still with fractioning column. Maceration of herbs and fruits was now moved to chrome steel tanks. The time of maceration for a typical batch ranges from 1 to 5 years. After filtration the liquor is further matured for 2\u20133 years. As all ingredients of the S\u01a1n Tinh liquors are natural, and cold-filtration is avoided to preserve the full flavour, some sedimentation might appear in the bottled products, or the liquor might show some cloudiness when cooled to very low temperatures or when water is added. == Products == The range of S\u01a1n Tinh products currently (as of 2014) consists of 12 different types, all produced from natural raw materials without the addition of any artificial flavouring, colouring or clearing agents. Almost all raw materials (with the excption of Korean white ginseng) are sourced in Vietnam. The products come in 2 different strengths of alcohol, 27% Vol. (for all the fruit types and the Nep Cam type), and 38% Vol. (for all the herbal types and the clear Nep Phu Loc distillate) The 12 flavours are: * Rose Apple (T\u00e1o M\u00e8o); 27% alc. Vol.: The Tao Meo fruit tree (Docynia indica (Wall)) is grown semi-cultivated in north-western Vietnam's mountain regions of Yen Bai, Lao Cai and Tuyen Quang. As there is no common English name for the fruit and the tree is in the family of the roses (Rosaceae) the owners of Son Tinh decided to give it the name \u201cRose Apple\u201d. * Apricot (M\u01a1 V\u00e0ng); 27% alc. Vol.: The apricots used are grown semi-cultivated in forested orchards in the northern Vietnamese mountain region of Bac Kan. The variety is similar to Japanese apricots. The fruits are deep yellow when ripe and small (1.5\u20133 cm in diameter), with a thick skin and a relatively big stone. The taste is sour and very tart making the fruits almost inedible by themselves. * Red Plum (M\u1eadn \u0110\u1ecf); 27% alc. Vol.: The plums are grown in north- western Vietnam's mountain regions of Lao Cai, Dien Bien and Son La. The fruits are similar to the English Victoria plum with yellow flesh and a red to green skin. The variety from Sa Pa in Lao Cao province, however, has deep red flesh and is called \u201cBlood plum\u201d (M\u1eadn m\u00e1u). * Passionfruit (Chanh Leo); 27% alc. Vol.: Most of the Passionfruits in Vietnam are grown in the Central Highlands, a mountain region in southern Vietnam. The fruits used are of the purple variety. * Red Sticky Rice (N\u1ebfp C\u1ea9m); 27% alc. Vol.: Both the method of production and the taste of S\u01a1n Tinh N\u1ebfp C\u1ea9m is similar to Portuguese port. In mid-fermentation the residual natural sugar is preserved in the rice by adding clear sticky rice liquor. Red sticky rice fermented with local yeast (similar to Japanese koji) is used for a wide range of very traditional dishes and drinks. * Sticky Rice (N\u1ebfp Ph\u00fa L\u1ed9c); 38% alc. Vol.: This is a clear distillate from a fragrant sticky rice variety grown in the Red River delta. The sticky rice used is unpolished, which preserves the distinct fragrance of the rice. Combined with slow distillation in a copper still the resulting distillate has flavours of young rice kernels, fresh bread and butter. * Minh M\u1ea1ng Herbal Blend; 38% alc. Vol.: Vietnam's most famous herbal liquor is associated with the name of Emperor Minh M\u1ea1ng who ruled in the 19th century. S\u01a1n Tinh Minh M\u1ea1ng is an adaptation of one of his herbal concoctions. The Minh M\u1ea1ng blend is made from 19 herbal ingredients. * V\u01b0\u01a1ng T\u1eedu Herbal Blend; 38% alc. Vol.: This herbal concoction is based on a traditional recipe produced for a Chinese empress, T\u1eeb Hy Th\u00e1i H\u1eadu (vietn.). The Empress was renowned for her virility and joy of life. The V\u01b0\u01a1ng T\u1eedu blend is made from 27 herbal ingredients. * White Ginseng Herbal Blend (B\u1ea1ch S\u00e2m); 38% alc. Vol.: The 6-year old white ginseng used for this herbal blend is imported from South Korea. * B\u1ed5 Sa Pa Herbal Blend; 38% alc. Vol.: The formula for this herbal liquor was developed and refined by herbalists in the mountain resort town of Sa Pa, Lao Cai province\", which is located in the mountainous far north-west of Vietnam. It contains more than 30 ingredients. * M\u1ef9 T\u1eedu Herbal Blend; 38% alc. Vol.: The M\u1ef9 T\u1eedu blend consists of 11 ingredients grown mainly in the mountainous regions of north-western Vietnam. * Nh\u1ea5t D\u1ea1 Herbal Blend; 38% alc. Vol.: The formula for this herbal liquor was created in the tradition of stimulating and invigorating Vietnamese bitters with more than 30 ingredients. == Drinking style and usage == Traditionally Vietnamese drank liquor in small tea cups or glasses in a \u201cbottom-up\u201d way. In an effort to move away from the \u201cin a small shot glass\u201d way of drinking, S\u01a1n Tinh has in 2011 introduced in its Highway4 restaurants a bulb-shaped glass with a wider opening. This was to increase the focus of drinking on taste and fragrance, aspects that were traditionally of minor importance. Another trend set by Son Tinh was to drink the sweeter fruit types with ice in larger glasses. In 2012 S\u01a1n Tinh was approached by a bar consultant from the UK, John Collingwood, who was intrigued by the unique flavours of the Son Tinh liquors and their potential use as ingredients in Western-style cocktails. In close cooperation S\u01a1n Tinh and John Collingwood developed a range of cocktails that merge international and Vietnamese ingredients with the flavours of S\u01a1n Tinh liquors and international liquors creating new variations of classic cocktails. Examples of such fusion cocktails: * Bitter Sweet Salute: This cocktail is a variation of the classic Negroni cocktail. However the Campari and Gin have been replaced with S\u01a1n Tinh's V\u01b0\u01a1ng T\u1eedu and N\u1ebfp Ph\u00fa L\u1ed9c respectively. * Highway4 Old Fashioned: A variation of the \u201cOld Fashioned\u201d cocktail with B\u1ed5 Sa Pa and M\u1eadn \u0110\u1ecf (Red Plum). == International awards == In 2011 S\u01a1n Tinh decided to subject its only locally known products to the scrutiny of international experts by submitting them to a number of renowned international spirits competitions. In these competitions the submitted products undergo blind tasting with a number of criteria relevant to the quality of the products, e.g. complexity, taste, colour, consistency, etc. While some competitions only award medals in different categories some also apply a point scoring method. Over the last 4 years S\u01a1n Tinh has received the following awards and nominations: International Wine and Spirits Competition (IWSC) 2011, London, UK: Silver Medal \u2013 Best in Class for S\u01a1n Tinh Rose Apple (T\u00e1o M\u00e8o) Liquor Silver Medal for S\u01a1n Tinh M\u1ef9 T\u1eedu Herbal Blend World Spirits Awards (WSA) 2012, Klagenfurt, Austria: Gold Medal (93 points) for S\u01a1n Tinh N\u1ebfp Ph\u00fa L\u1ed9c Sticky Rice Liquor Gold Medal (92 points) for S\u01a1n Tinh B\u1ed5 Sa Pa Herbal Blend Gold Medal (90 points) for S\u01a1n Tinh Minh M\u1ea1ng Herbal Liquor Hong Kong International Wine & Spirit Competition (HKIWSC) 2012, Hong Kong: Bronze Medal for S\u01a1n Tinh N\u1ebfp Ph\u00fa L\u1ed9c Sticky Rice Liquor Bronze Medal for S\u01a1n Tinh Apricot (M\u01a1 V\u00e0ng) Liquor Bronze Medal for S\u01a1n Tinh Minh M\u1ea1ng Herbal Liquor San Francisco World Spirits Competition (SFWSC) 2013, San Francisco, US: Bronze Medal for S\u01a1n Tinh N\u1ebfp Ph\u00fa L\u1ed9c Sticky Rice Liquor Bronze Medal for S\u01a1n Tinh Red Plum (M\u1eadn \u0110\u1ecf) Liquor Bronze Medal for S\u01a1n Tinh Rose Apple (T\u00e1o M\u00e8o) Liquor Bronze Medal for S\u01a1n Tinh White Ginseng (B\u1ea1ch S\u00e2m) Liquor Beverage Testing Institute (BTI) 2013, Chicago, US: Silver Medal (86 points: Highly Recommended) for S\u01a1n Tinh N\u1ebfp Ph\u00fa L\u1ed9c Sticky Rice Liquor New York International Spirits Competition (NYISC) 2013, New York, US: Silver Medal for S\u01a1n Tinh Passionfruit (Chanh Leo) Liquor Distillery of the Year \u2013 Category Liqueurs Superior Taste Awards by the International Taste & Quality Institute (ITQI) 2014, Brussel, Belgium: 2 Golden Stars (overall mark in between 80 and 90%: remarkable taste) for S\u01a1n Tinh N\u1ebfp Ph\u00fa L\u1ed9c Sticky Rice Liquor Asian Spirits Masters (ASM) 2014, London, UK: Gold Medal for S\u01a1n Tinh M\u01a1 V\u00e0ng (Apricot) Liquor Silver Medal for S\u01a1n Tinh N\u1ebfp Ph\u00fa L\u1ed9c Sticky Rice Liquor Silver Medal for S\u01a1n Tinh Nh\u1ea5t D\u1ea1 Herbal Blend Melbourne International Spirits Competition (MISC) 2014, Melbourne, Australia: Silver Medal for S\u01a1n Tinh N\u1ebfp Ph\u00fa L\u1ed9c Sticky Rice Liquor Bronze Medal for S\u01a1n Tinh Rose Apple (T\u00e1o M\u00e8o) Liquor Bronze Medal for S\u01a1n Tinh V\u01b0\u01a1ng T\u1eedu Herbal Blend Vietnam Distillery of the Year 2014 Beverage Testing Institute (BTI) 2015, Chicago, USA: Gold Medal for S\u01a1n Tinh N\u1ebfp C\u1ea9m Red Sticky Rice Liquor (94 Points, Exceptional) The 50 Best Competition in New York, USA: Gold Medal for S\u01a1n Tinh Rose Apple (T\u00e1o M\u00e8o) Silver Medal for S\u01a1n Tinh Nh\u1ea5t D\u1ea1 Herbal Blend New York International Spirits Competition 2016: Gold Medal for S\u01a1n Tinh N\u1ebfp Ph\u00fa L\u1ed9c Sticky Rice Liquor Vietnam Distillery of The Year Singapore World Spirits Competition (SWSC) 2019: Silver Medal for S\u01a1n Tinh N\u1ebfp Ph\u00fa L\u1ed9c Sticky Rice Liquor == Category branding == Since the first submission to an international spirits competition, S\u01a1n Tinh faced the lack of an appropriate category for its submission. Staunchly refusing to register its distinctively Vietnamese liquor as vodka, shochu or any other nationally branded variety, S\u01a1n Tinh had for years to resort to the category \u201cOthers\u201d. However, in 2014 the Asian Spirits Masters competition of The Spirits Business publication from London for the first time acknowledged \u201cRuou\u201d as a liquor category in its own right ==References== == External links == * * Markus Madeja: Schnapsbrenner in Hanoi * Pfl\u00fcmli aus Vietnam * * Vietnam Culture by the Glass * Reisschnaps mit Hoden * Category:Vietnamese wine Category:Vietnamese alcoholic drinks Category:Distilled drinks Category:Vietnamese brands Category:Drink companies of Vietnam ",
