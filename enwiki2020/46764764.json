    "text": "Horse Park Drive is an arterial road in the Gungahlin district of Canberra, Australia. It is named for the homestead Horse Park, built in 1853 which is located in the suburb of Jacka. The road provides a bypass of the Gungahlin town centre, linking the western suburbs of the district to the Federal Highway to Goulburn and Majura Parkway, linking to the Monaro Highway and Canberra Airport. The road is a single carriageway for most of its length and is prone to traffic congestion at peak times. Work to duplicate Horse Park Drive between Well Station Drive and Anthony Rolfe Avenue has been completed, and duplication of the remainder of the road between the Federal Highway and Bernard Heinze Avenue has also been completed. ==See also== ==References== Category:Streets in Canberra ",
