Spare Miami-bass beats provide the apt low end for her below-the-belt rhymes on Da Baddest Bitch. And a song about the pain of loving a violent, cash-obsessed thug shows that she's as skilled at speaking truths as she is at hawking fantasies.\" Billboard says, \"Rap divadom has a new challenger. Trina makes her solo debut with the single, \"Da Baddest Bitch,\" off the album of the same name. The 21-year-old rapper, who made her debut on Trick Daddy's party anthem \"Nann,\" proudly carries the torch lit by female MCs like Lil' Kim and Foxy Brown before her, as an artist not afraid to use her feminine wiles to get what she wants. The Miami bass-influenced track, produced by the Black Mob, has Trina making some serious demands on her men in a slow and steady Florida flow. The hook borrows liberally from Michael Jackson's classic \"Bad,\" as it asks, \"Who's bad?\" Trina shows that female MCs can boast just like the big boys of rap.\" === Commercial performance === The album debuted at number 33 on the US Billboard 200 and number 11 on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart. In November 2000, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling 700,000 copies in the United States.RIAA \u2013 Gold & Platinum Searchable Database \u2013 December 27, 2012 Da Baddest Bitch stayed on the Billboard 200 chart for 29 weeks and on the Top Hip-Hop/R&B; chart for 49 consecutive weeks in the United States. == Track listing == == Personnel == Credits for Da Baddest Bitch adapted from AllMusic.Da Baddest Bitch \u2013 Trina : Credits : AllMusic *Robert Alexander \u2013 art direction *Derrick Baker \u2013 producer *Richard Bates \u2013 art direction, photography *Black Mob Group \u2013 producer *Hugo Boss \u2013 producer *Thomas Bricker \u2013 art direction, design *Mike Caren \u2013 art direction *Charles Harrison \u2013 producer *Solomon \"Sox\" Hepburn \u2013 executive *JV \u2013 engineer *Alan Lewis \u2013 creative director *Mr. Seay \u2013 mixing *Deuce Poppito of 24 Karatz \u2013 performer *Red Spyda \u2013 producer *Righteous Funk Boogie \u2013 engineer, producer *Leland Robinson \u2013 producer *Alvin Speights \u2013 mixing *Trick Daddy \u2013 performer *Trina \u2013 liner notes *Dwayne Webb \u2013 producer == Charts == {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
