While the Howling Commandos are successful in defeating the mutated crew members, they merged into one giant plantlike monster. Man-Thing used his touch to burn the giant plantlike monster where its link to the Earth Idol of Golthana caused it to burn as well.Howling Commandos of S.H.I.E.L.D. #1 The next mission that S.T.A.K.E gives to the Howling Commandos involves them fighting Sphinx and Adversary which led to them getting Glyph on their team.Howling Commandos of S.H.I.E.L.D #2\u20135 During the Avengers: Standoff! storyline, Paul Kraye caught Orrgo going through some S.T.A.K.E. files and informed Maria Hill enough for Orrgo to be sent to Pleasant Hill.
