    "text": "Amanita muscaria var. formosa, known as the yellow orange fly agaric, is a hallucinogenic and poisonous basidiomycete fungus of the genus Amanita. This variety, which can sometimes be distinguished from most other A. muscaria by its yellow cap, is a European taxon, although several North American field guides have referred 'A. muscaria var. guessowii' to this name. American mycologist Harry D. Thiers described a yellow-capped taxon that he called var. formosa from the United States, but it is not the same as the European variety. ==Controversy== Recent DNA evidence has shown Amanita muscaria var. formosa to be a distinct species from Amanita muscaria and it will be getting its own species status soon. Amanita muscaria var. formosa has been described as 'Amanita muscaria var. guessowii'. ==See also== *List of Amanita species ==References== ==External links== * Category:Fungi of Europe Category:Poisonous fungi muscaria var. formosa ",
