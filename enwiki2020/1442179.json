According to 13th-century poet Snorri Sturluson, he is the brother of Loki and B\u00fdleistr. == Name == The Old Norse name Helblindi has been translated as 'Helblind'. Helblindi is also one of the many names of the god Odin, as found in Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l (The Lay of Gr\u00edmnir) or Gylfaginning (The Beguiling of Gylfi). == Attestations == In the Prose Edda, Helblindi is several times noted as the brother of Loki and, implicitly, as the son of Laufey and F\u00e1rbauti.Rydberg (2003:24); Sykes (2002:85); Guelpa (2009:123-124). == Theories == Although it is not directly attested in original sources, scholars have considered Helblindi to be a son of F\u00e1rbauti. His exact role in the ancient mythic complex surrounding Loki's family remains unclear, however.; Kock (1899:100-102). == References == === Bibliography === * * Category:J\u00f6tnar Category:Names of Odin ",
