    "text": "Cinco y Diez pedestrian bridge La Cinco y Diez (lit. \"The Five and Ten\", also written \"La 5 y 10\"), is the name of an intersection, pedestrian overpass over that intersection, public transportation hub and major retail district in La Mesa borough, Tijuana, Mexico. The name exists because a branch of the Luj\u00e1n/Cardenas family's \"La Cinco y Diez\" five and dime store once stood here, and Tijuana residents taking taxis or buses would ask to be let off by \"La Cinco y Diez\". The area has multiple branches of some chain retailers. Shopping centers include: *Plaza Carrousel, with a Cin\u00e9polis multicinema, Soriana S\u00faper supermarket, and a Sears * Plaza Cedros with an Elektra appliance/electronics/motorcycle store * Plaza 5 y 10 with a Ley supermarket and Coppel department store * Plaza D\u00edaz Ordaz with a Calimax supermarket * Plaza Las Brisas with a Coppel department store, \"Soriana h\u00edper\" hypermarket, and Elektra appliance/electronics/motorcycle store * \"Serviplaza mesa 5 y 10\" with Coppel and FAMSA department stores and a \"Soriana h\u00edper\" hypermarket * Swap Meet 5 y 10 * Swap Meet Las Carpas * a free-standing Smart & Final supermarket * a free-standing Parisina department store * a Caliente casino ==References== Category:Neighborhoods in Tijuana Category:Shopping malls in Tijuana Category:Edge cities in Mexico Category:Shopping districts and streets in Mexico ",
