    "text": "The United Sabah National Organisation (New) () is a political party in Sabah, Malaysia. The new United Sabah National Organisation (Usno Baru) was one of 20 new political parties approved nationwide by the Registrar of Societies (RoS) in 2013 and was formed after the old United Sabah National Organisation (Usno), founded by Sabah's third chief minister Datu Mustapha Harun in 1967, was deregistered by the RoS in 1996. The party on 29 November 2018 elected a new party president Ibrahim Linggam replacing pro tem president Dulli Tiaseh, and its office-bearers ending five years of hiatus due to an internal squabble over who among three of its leaders should be president since the new party inception in 2013. == See also == * Politics of Malaysia * List of political parties in Malaysia * United Sabah National Organisation (Old) == References == == External links == * * Category:Political parties in Sabah Category:Political parties established in 2013 Category:2013 establishments in Malaysia ",
