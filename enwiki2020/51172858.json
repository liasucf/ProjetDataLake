McMenamins became the custodian of the property in 1999. == History == In 1917, plans were developed for the Masonic and Eastern Star Home for the State of Oregon, and construction began in 1920. It was established as a home for elderly and infirm Masons, and began operations in 1922. A smaller building, called the Children's Cottage, was built in 1926 to house orphans, but the orphanage closed in 1928 after conflict between the children and the elders. Throughout the 1930s, the home struggled financially. The building suffered roof damage in 1962 after the Columbus Day Storm. In 1999 the Masons began building new facilities with the intention of moving out of the original Masonic Home and Children's Cottage. McMenamins began renovations fall 1999, and reopened the building as McMenamins Grand Lodge in March 2000. The building now contains hotel rooms, meeting spaces, and a movie theatre. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Buildings and structures in Forest Grove, Oregon Category:McMenamins Category:Hotels in Oregon Category:Hotels established in 2000 ",
