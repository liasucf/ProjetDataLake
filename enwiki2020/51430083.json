Its local significance grew when the Socola Monastery church underwent repairs, leaving it the only functioning place of worship in the area. Made of brick on a stone foundation, the church is small in size. It is trefoil in shape, with a foyer, vestibule, nave and altar. There are two symmetrical semicircular apses, each with a narrow arched window. Other windows ensure that light streams into the building. The outside walls are plastered and lack decoration; the roof is simple, in two sections. The interior walls are not painted. There is a hexagonal spire above the foyer, with a window on each face. Throughout, the ceilings are flat, made of varnished beams. The foyer and bell tower above the entrance were rebuilt in 1995. The church underwent restorations, including painting of the whole interior, from 2006 to 2012. The iconostasis features the relics of Saints Charalambos, Pantaleon, Cosmas, with Luke the Evangelist added later.
