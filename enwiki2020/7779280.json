    "text": "A Bush coconut The Bush coconut, or bloodwood apple, is an Australian bush tucker food, often eaten by Indigenous people of Central Australia. The bush coconut is, in fact, a combination of plant and animal: an adult female scale insect, Cystococcus pomiformis, lives in a gall induced on a bloodwood eucalypt (Corymbia terminalis). The gall looks like a small, knobbly woody fruit, ranging in size from a golf ball to a tennis ball, with a milky white flesh inside upon which the insect and its male offspring feed.Gullan, P. J. and A. Cockburn. 1986. Sexual dichronism and intersexual phoresy in gall- forming coccoids. Oecologia 68:632-634. Bush coconut is called Merne arrkirlpangkwerle in the Arrernte language of Central Australia. The gall is picked and then cracked open with a rock. The Arrernte call the insect angure. ==See also== *Mulga apple ==References== Category:Bushfood Category:Australian Aboriginal bushcraft Category:Insects as food Category:Insects of Australia Category:Galls ",
