Although he and McCormack admitted constructing the bomb, which was intended to be used to destroy a power station, they claimed not to be involved in planting the bomb. Se\u00e1n MacBride, a former Chief-of-Staff for the IRA and Irish barrister, attempted to secure their release claiming they were being illegally held without a writ of habeas corpus.Coogan, Tim Pat. On the Blanket: The Inside Story of the IRA Prisoners' \"Dirty\" Protest. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2002. (p. 38). However, charged with murder along with McCormack, Brigid O'Hara, Joseph and Mary Hewitt on 12 December, all five pleaded not guilty before the court at Birmingham Assizes.\"Five Charged with Murder by Bomb\". Irish Press. 12 December 1939. Brigid O'Hara issued statements between 28 August and 4 September to Scotland Yard and Birmingham police denying any knowledge of the bombings,\"Bomb Murder Charge.

Their trial and execution resulted in a public outcry in Ireland against Neville Chamberlain and the British Government as Peadar O'Donnell and other prominent Irish writers signed a petition campaigning for leniency towards the condemned men.\u00d3 Drisceoil, Donal. \"Peadar O'Donnell\".
