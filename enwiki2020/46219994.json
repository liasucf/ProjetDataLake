It was the 109th edition of the annual Monte Carlo Masters tournament, which was sponsored by Rolex for the seventh time. It took place at the Monte Carlo Country Club in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France (though billed as Monte Carlo, Monaco). ==Points and prize money== ===Points distribution=== Because the Monte Carlo Masters is the non-mandatory Masters 1000 event, special rules regarding points distribution are in place. The Monte Carlo Masters counts as one of a player's 500 level tournaments, while distributing Masters 1000 points.Ranking points {|class=wikitable style=font- size:90%;text-align:center |- |style=\"width:130px; background:#dfe2e9;\"|Event |style=\"width:80px; background:lime;\"| |style=\"width:85px; background:thistle;\"| |style=\"width:85px; background:#ff0;\"| |style=\"width:85px; background:#ffebcd;\"| |style=\"width:85px; background:#afeeee;\"|Round of 16 |style=\"width:85px; background:#afeeee;\"|Round of 32 |style=\"width:85px; background:#afeeee;\"|Round of 64 |width=85| |width=85| |width=85| |- !style=\"background:#ededed;\"|Men's Singles |rowspan=2|1,000 |rowspan=2|600 |rowspan=2|360 |rowspan=2|180 |rowspan=2|90 |rowspan=2|45 |10 |25 |16 |0 |- !style=\"background:#ededed;\"|Men's Doubles |0 | | | |} ===Prize money=== The total prize money pot for the 2015 competition is \u20ac3,288,530, distributed throughout both competitions. ==Singles main draw entrants== ===Seeds=== {|class=wikitable !width=70| Country !width=175| Player !Rank !Seed |- | |Novak Djokovic |1 |1 |- | |Roger Federer |2 |2 |- | |Rafael Nadal |5 |3 |- | |Milos Raonic |6 |4 |- | |David Ferrer |7 |5 |- | |Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych |8 |6 |- | |Stan Wawrinka |9 |7 |- | |Marin \u010cili\u0107 |10 |8 |- | |Grigor Dimitrov |11 |9 |- | |Gilles Simon |13 |10 |- | |Jo-Wilfried Tsonga |14 |11 |- | |Roberto Bautista Agut |15 |12 |- | |Ernests Gulbis |17 |13 |- | |Ga\u00ebl Monfils |18 |14 |- | |John Isner |19 |15 |- | |Tommy Robredo |20 |16 |} *Rankings are as of April 6, 2015 ===Other entrants=== The following players received wildcards into the main draw: * Benjamin Balleret * Ga\u00ebl Monfils * Lucas Pouille * Mikhail Youzhny The following players used a protected ranking to gain entry into the main draw: * Florian Mayer The following players received entry from the qualifying draw: * Norbert Gombos * Denis Kudla * Andrey Kuznetsov * Beno\u00eet Paire * Albert Ramos-Vi\u00f1olas * \u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin * Diego Schwartzman The following players received entry as lucky losers: * Robin Haase * Jan-Lennard Struff ===Withdrawals=== ;Before the tournament * Nicol\u00e1s Almagro \u2192replaced by Robin Haase * Julien Benneteau \u2192replaced by V\u00edctor Estrella Burgos * Pablo Cuevas \u2192replaced by Borna \u0106ori\u0107 * Richard Gasquet \u2192replaced by Andreas Haider-Maurer * Nick Kyrgios \u2192replaced by Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta * Sam Querrey \u2192replaced by Jan-Lennard Struff ===Retirements=== * V\u00edctor Estrella Burgos * Milos Raonic (right foot injury) ==Doubles main draw entrants== ===Seeds=== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- ! width=\"70\"| Country ! width=\"175\"| Player ! width=\"70\"| Country ! width=\"175\"| Player !
