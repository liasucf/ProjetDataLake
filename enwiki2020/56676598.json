Before dedicating his time fully to swimming he chose to go to college and finish his education. He returned to the pool in 1982 and began competed in class S3 events up until he retired due to ill health just before the 2008 Paralympic Games in Beijing.

Cairns made his Paralympic Games debut in 1984, winning four gold medals, one individual silver, and a team silver in the relay.While this would prove to be his greatest Paralympic performance he was able to win at least one medal in every Paralympic Games from 1992 to 2004, finding particular success in the freestyle events. Between 1990 and 2006 Cairns won 16 medals in World Championship competitions, including 7 golds, and 21 medals in European Championships until 2001. He swam relay events with Mike Kenny and Sascha Kindred amongst others. Now retired, Cairns continues to support swimming galas around the country that are organised by Scottish Disability Sport. At one such event Cairns met and inspired Andrew Mullen who went on to find World Championship and Paralympic swimming success.}} ==References== Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Paralympic gold medalists for Great Britain Category:Medalists at the 1984 Summer Paralympics Category:Medalists at the 1992 Summer Paralympics Category:Medalists at the 1996 Summer Paralympics Category:Medalists at the 2000 Summer Paralympics Category:Medalists at the 2004 Summer Paralympics Category:Paralympic medalists in swimming Category:Swimmers at the 1984 Summer Paralympics Category:Swimmers at the 1992 Summer Paralympics Category:Swimmers at the 1996 Summer Paralympics Category:Swimmers at the 2000 Summer Paralympics Category:Swimmers at the 2004 Summer Paralympics Category:Paralympic swimmers of Great Britain ",
