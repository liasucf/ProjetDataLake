The overarm bowling issue came to a head in a controversial match at The Oval. ==Important matches== * 1862 match list ==Events== 26 August. Surrey v. England at The Oval. Edgar Willsher of England was no-balled six times in succession by John Lillywhite (son of FW Lillywhite) for bowling with his hand above the shoulder. For some years previously, Willsher and others had bowled in this way and the incident at The Oval put the issue into context. The drama was exaggerated when Willsher and the other eight professionals in the England team walked off the field. Play continued next day but with a replacement umpire. ==Leading batsmen== Thomas Hayward was the leading runscorer with 661 @ 31.47 ==Leading bowlers== George Tarrant was the leading wicket-taker with 96 @ 10.07 ==References== ==Annual reviews== * Fred Lillywhite, The Guide to Cricketers, Lillywhite, 1863 * Arthur Haygarth, Scores & Biographies, Volume 7 (1861-1862), Lillywhite, 1863 ==Further reading== * Derek Birley, A Social History of English Cricket, Aurum, 1999 ==External links== * CricketArchive - season summaries Category:1862 in English cricket Category:English cricket seasons from 1816 to 1863 ",
