The albums can be loosely described as a series of sound clashes, collaborations and musical experiments that veer off the path of conventional dance music. The first Hawke album, Namaquadisco, was released in 1998 on Sunburn Recordings in the USA and Distance in France. The album was recorded in Hyde Street Studios in San Francisco, CA's Tenderloin district. Heatstroke, recorded in the Hardkiss Studio based at Frisco Studios in the Lower Haight in San Francisco, was released by Six Degrees Records in 2000. The single Party People was a breakout into Billboard Magazine's Dance Charts. Love Won Another was recorded in a farm house in Calistoga California and released on Eighth Dimension Records in 2004. The album spawned two remix albums and several music videos. In 2009, an album titled +++, recorded in San Diego and San Rafael California, was released on Eighth Dimension Records. It was inaugurated with a series of art gallery shows in San Francisco, CA, Los Angeles and Orlando featuring multi-media works inspired by songs from the album. In 1998, Gavin Hardkiss created a three part musical landscape entitled Museo Hypnotica for the Jean Giraud designed Airtight Garage environment at the Sony Metreon in San Francisco. In 2008, Hardkiss worked with the Zukov Ballet Theater on original music production and DJ performance at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco. Between 2011 and 2013, Gavin Hardkiss had a weekly radio show on pirate Radio Valencia called In My Boom, which highlighted local San Francisco dance music. In 2017, the Hawke album Love In Stars was released through a PledgeMusic crowdfunding campaign that included a treasure hunt for Gold USBs containing Hawke music which were hidden in the hills around the Bay Area. Insomniac Magazine called it a \"Willy Wonka-style ... experiment in giving both artistic and economic value to a digital music project.\" Hardkiss has also recorded music under aliases including The Lower Haight High Hitters, Curious Yellow and Sunburn Kidz. == References == == External Links == * Hardkiss Music Website \u2013 http://www.hardkiss.org/ * Gavin Hardkiss Blog \u2013 http://gavinhardkiss.com/ * Discography \u2013 http://www.discogs.com/artist/16473-Gavin-Hardkiss * Soundcloud - https://soundcloud.com/gavin-hardkiss * Facebook \u2013 https://www.facebook.com/gavinhardkiss Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:South African dance musicians ",
