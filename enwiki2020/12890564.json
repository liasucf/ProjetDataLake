Born in Leeds and currently living in Gateshead, he is the founding principal of Gateshead Jewish Academy for Girls. ==Biography== His works were first published weekly for years in the English edition of the chareidi Litvish newspaper Yated Ne'eman, under the pseudonym Tuvia Cohen in columns explaining and observing nature through popular science with a creationist perspective, and was later published by Feldheim Publishers and ArtScroll in three separate books: # Designer World # Our Amazing World # Our Wondrous World He credits his works by being inspired through his mentor the late Rabbi Avigdor Miller.In the Acknowledgments of his 3 books He begins each chapter with a look at a familiar everyday or interesting worldly phenomenon or a quirk of human nature and presents it with classic anecdotal and dry British wit. Then he takes the reader to a closer look, using his foreword as a stepping stone and analogy to the broader scientific subject, presenting the deep wisdom of plan and purpose in every single minute detail of creation and life. Every chapter looks at a different issue, from the animal kingdom to the plant world, and from the vast universe of cosmos to the functions and details of the human body and physique. Katz takes his readers behind the scenes of nature and shows the hand and wisdom of a planner, designer and facilitator, through scientific facts and explanations. Rabbi Matisyohu Salomon the spiritual leader of Lakewood Jewish community and his acquaintance from his native Gateshead, writes that \"the works of Rabbi Katz is [sic] an updated Sha'ar Habechina,\"in the haskama (preface-blessing) to the book Our Wondrous World meaning that this style and form of teaching to make people aware of the wonders of nature was first done by the Chovot ha-Levavot, which is now very primitive and outdated form of science, mainly in his second chapter, Sha'ar HaBechina. This is now revived and updated by Rabbi Katz. ==Works== * Designer World * Our Amazing WorldExcerpt: 88 Hours Non-Stop Excerpt: The Long Sleep * Our Wondrous WorldExcerpt: Parenting Instincts in Our Wondrous World ==References== Category:English Jews Category:British Jewish writers Category:Haredi rabbis in Europe Category:Jewish creationists Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
