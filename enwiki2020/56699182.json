He died after a controversial car accident where his car collided with a military vehicle. == Early life == Raif Denkta\u015f was born on January 26, 1951 in Nicosia to Ayd\u0131n and Rauf Denkta\u015f, the founder and the former President of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. He attended to the K\u00f6\u015fkl\u00fc\u00e7iftlik Primary School which was later renamed as \u015eehit Tuncer Primary School following the death of his primary school teacher during the 1963 intercommunal violence between Turkish and Greek Cypriots. Before graduating from T\u00fcrk Maarif Koleji in 1969, he studied a part of his secondary education in TED Ankara College and in Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Maarif College during his father's exile in Turkey. Denkta\u015f fought during the 1963 incidents at the age of 12. He was also on military service for the 22nd Squad as a high school student from 1968 to 1969. He returned to his squad temporarily in 1974 after the coup d'\u00e9tat organised by the Greek Junta and stayed until the completion of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. == Academics == Raif Denkta\u015f received his bachelor's degree in public administration from the Middle East Technical University, followed by a master's degree in political science from the University of Oxford. Denkta\u015f received an offer from the latter institution to complete his PhD in sociology of politics in 1982, however he opted to return to Cyprus and pursue a political career. He taught in Eastern Mediterranean University from September 1985 to his death in December 1985. == Political career == In the 1976 General Elections he was elected for the Federated Assembly as a National Unity Party MP. Even though he worked as the Secretary General, he resigned from the NUP in 1981 citing a difference in views. He founded the Alliance of Patriotic Intelligentsia in 1982 and the Social Democratic Party on December 30, 1982. He represented his party at the Founding Parliament of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus as an MP, following the establishment of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in 1983. He also changed his affiliation to the broader Social Democracy Group but had to reverse this move due to legal complications. Denkta\u015f was known as a strong critic to his father. Regardless of this, he was appointed by him as the Political Adviser to the President in 1985. He also opposed heavily to the government and the National Unity Party during the preparations of the constitution. As a Kemalist, he wrote many articles on Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk's ideas but fiercely supported independence over a possible annexation by Turkey. He was also known for endorsing the Cyprus peace process. His visit to the southern part of the Cyprus in 1984 along with the Communal Liberation Party leader \u0130smail Bozkurt and the Secretary General of the Republican Turkish Party, Naci Talat Usar was reported as the first visit by Turkish Cypriots since their displacement in 1974. This visit was criticised heavily by the nationalists and the visitors were called as \"traitors\" by Birlik newspaper. == Musical career == Raif Denkta\u015f played the bass guitar for the school band of TED Ankara College where two of his compatriots were also playing. Upon his return to Cyprus, he joined Bayrak Kuartet in 1968. The band was supported by the army personnel and they practised at the basement of the headquarters of the 22nd Squad where Raif was deployed. In 1969, S\u0131la 4 was formed by Raif, Ferahzat G\u00fcrsoy, Erdin\u00e7 G\u00fcnd\u00fcz and Ayd\u0131n Kalfao\u011flu. Raif sang and played bass guitar for the band. S\u0131la 4 is regarded as the most influential music band which has shaped the Turkish Cypriot music, combining folk tunes and lyrics together and arranging them to the contemporary context. Raif Denkta\u015f composed many different songs including Gariban and Ayr\u0131l\u0131k which was not only popular in Cyprus, but also in Turkey. == Death == During 1985, Raif Denkta\u015f was subjected to many criticism and alleged defamation by both the Turkish and the Turkish Cypriot press. Many different news, composed of hoaxes were being published including claims that Raif was hiding H\u00fcseyin Kocaba\u015f, a Turkish assassin at his home or he was drug trafficking in Cyprus. National Intelligence Organization of Turkey later admitted that the stories were fabricated by their agents and the agents were fired. Raif's father Rauf, claimed that he was attacked for not agreeing to Turkey's political demands at that time. Two weeks after the claims on drug trafficking were published, he sustained fatal injuries in a car crash near Cihangir on his way back from Famagusta after lecturing at the Eastern Mediterranean University on December 24, 1985. A military vehicle collided with the car Raif was driving. He was moved to Ankara for treatment, but died on December 26, 1985. == References == Category:1951 births Category:1985 deaths Category:People from Nicosia Category:National Unity Party (Northern Cyprus) politicians Category:Members of the Assembly of the Republic (Northern Cyprus) Category:Children of national leaders Category:Road incident deaths in Cyprus Category:T\u00fcrk Maarif Koleji alumni Category:Faculty by university or college in Northern Cyprus ",
