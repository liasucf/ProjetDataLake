Starting from 2006, every two years Institute holds a conference \"Mathematical Biology and Bioinformatics\". ==History== ===Milestones=== The Institute of Mathematical Problems of Biology RAS (IMPB RAS) was founded in 1972. When organized, the Institute received the name of the Research Computing Centre (RCC) of the USSR Academy of Sciences. In 1992 the Research Computing Centre was reorganized into the Institute of Mathematical Problems of Biology RAS. As a result of the reorganization in RAS of 2015\u201316 The order on accession IMPB to the KIAM IMPB has become a branch of KIAM since 15 February 2016. ===Principals=== * 1972\u201398 Molchanov, Albert Makarievich, director, mathematician. * 1998\u20132016 Lakhno, Viktor Dmitrievich, director, mathematician. * since 2016 Lakhno, Viktor Dmitrievich, branch manager, mathematician. ===Famous faculty and alumni=== * Dedus, Florence Fyodorovich * Molchanov, Albert Makarievich * Shnol, Emmanuel El'evich ==References== ==External links== * Institute web site Category:Educational institutions established in 1972 Category:Mathematical institutes Category:Institutes of the Russian Academy of Sciences Category:Universities and institutes established in the Soviet Union Category:Research institutes in the Soviet Union Category:1972 establishments in the Soviet Union ",
