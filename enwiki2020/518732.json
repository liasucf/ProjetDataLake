He was actually not among those originally chosen for the semi-final round, but was put through when contestant Donnie Williams was disqualified for a drunk driving arrest. ==American Idol== Huff was not voted through to the final round from his group of semi-finalists, but got another second chance when he was brought back for the wildcard round and put through as a finalist by contest judge Simon Cowell. During this period, New Orleans Fox Affiliate WVUE would hold specials including Huff's family cheering George on during the latest episodes. On May 5, 2004, Huff was voted off in fifth place after two renditions of Fred Astaire's \"Cheek to Cheek\" and Louis Armstrong's \"What a Wonderful World\" during big band week. ===American Idol performances=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Week/Theme !Date Sung !Song Sung !Artist !Status |- |Semi-finals [N/A] |March 2, 2004 |\"Always and Forever\" |Heatwave |Eliminated |- |Wild Card [N/A] |March 9, 2004 |\"Lean on Me\" |Bill Withers |Selected |- |Top 12 Soul week |March 16, 2004 |\"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\" |Otis Redding |Safe |- |Top 11 Country week |March 23, 2004 |\"I Can Love You Like That\" |John Michael Montgomery |Safe |- |Top 10 Motown week |March 30, 2004 |\"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\" |The Temptations |Safe |- |Top 9 Elton John |April 6, 2004 |\"Take Me to the Pilot\" |Elton John |Safe |- |Top 8 Cinema |April 14, 2004 |\"Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)\" \\- from \"Against All Odds\" |Phil Collins |Safe |- |Top 7 Barry Manilow |April 20, 2004 |\"Tryin' to Get the Feeling Again\" |Barry Manilow |Safe |- |Top 6 Gloria Estefan |April 27, 2004 |\"Live for Loving You\" |Gloria Estefan |Bottom 2 |- |Top 5 Big band week |May 4, 2004 |\"Cheek to Cheek\" \"What a Wonderful World\" |Fred Astaire Louis Armstrong |Eliminated |} ==After Idol== His album, Miracles, was released by Word Records, on October 11, 2005.
