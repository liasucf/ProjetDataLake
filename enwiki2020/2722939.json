    "text": "Michael Golden is an American comics artist and writer best known for his late-1970s work on Marvel Comics' The Micronauts, as well as his co-creation of the characters Rogue and Bucky O'Hare. His work is known to have influenced the style of artist Arthur Adams. ==Career== After starting his illustration career in commercial art, Golden entered the comics industry in late 1977, working on such DC Comics titles as Mister Miracle and Batman Family. His first work for Marvel Comics was \"The Cask of Amontillado\", a backup story in Marvel Classics Comics #28 (1977) adapting an Edgar Allan Poe short story. In 1978, he collaborated with Bill Mantlo on Marvel's Micronauts which he illustrated for the series' first 12 issues. He drew a number of Marvel series throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including Doctor Strange, the Howard the Duck black-and-white comics magazine, and Marvel Fanfare. Writer Chris Claremont co-created Rogue with Golden in The Avengers Annual #10 (1981).DeFalco, Tom \"1980s\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 203: \"[Rogue's] first published appearance occurred in The Avengers Annual #10 by Chris Claremont and Michael Golden.\" At Continuity Comics, Golden and writer Larry Hama introduced Bucky O'Hare in Echo of Futurepast #1 (May 1984). Back at Marvel, The 'Nam series was launched in 1986 by Doug Murray and Golden.DeFalco \"1980s\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 229: \"[Editor Larry] Hama immediately called Doug Murray, a veteran who had served in Vietnam...Hama also called artist Michael Golden to draw the new title.\" Golden drew covers for the licensed series G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero, Rom, U.S. 1, and The Saga of Crystar. Golden also penciled parts of the Marvel No-Prize Book . In the early 1990s, Golden was an editor for DC ComicsNolen- Weathington in Modern Masters Volume 12: Michael Golden p. 44 and later in the decade served as Senior Art Director for Marvel Comics.Nolen-Weathington in Modern Masters Volume 12: Michael Golden p. 52-55 In the 2000s, he drew covers for DC Comics' Nightwing, Superman: The Man of Steel, and Vigilante. Despite his considerable amount of work in comics, Golden has stated that he still finds advertising and commercial design work to be more fulfilling than comics, because \"it's something different each time.\" Golden's art style later inspired a number of later comics creators, including Arthur Adams. Golden's work was also appropriated by Glenn Danzig as a logo for his bands Samhain and Danzig. He is managed by Ren\u00e9e Witterstaetter (a former comics colorist, writer, and editor) of Eva Ink Publishing. In a 1997 interview with Wizard magazine, Golden explained that he had not attended a comics convention since 1979, because he is uncomfortable with the cult of personality treatment of comics creators. By the 2000s, however, he had been known to make appearances at conventions. == Bibliography == ===Interior art=== ====Continuity==== * Bucky O'Hare #1\u20132, 4\u20135 (1991\u201392) * Echo of Futurepast (Bucky O'Hare) #1\u20136 (1984\u201385) * ====DC Comics==== * Batman #295 (\"Unsolved Cases of The Batman\") #303 (1978) * Batman Special #1 (1984) * Batman Family (Man-Bat) #15\u201317; (Batman) #18\u201320 (1978) * Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight Annual #1 (1991) * Batman: Odyssey #1 (2010) * Batman: Odyssey vol. 2 #1\u20132 (2011\u20132012) * Birds of Prey #66 (2004) * DC Special Series (Batman) #15 (1978) * Deathstroke, The Terminator #12 (1992) * Detective Comics (The Demon and Bat-Mite stories) #482 (1979) * Ghosts #67, 88 (1978\u20131980) * House of Mystery #257, 259, 266 (1978\u20131979) * House of Secrets (Abel) #148\u2013149 (one page each), #151 (1977\u20131978) * Justice League Europe Annual #2 (four-pages inks over John Beatty, among other artists) (1991) * Mister Miracle #23\u201325 (1978) * Mystery in Space #113 (1980) * Secrets of Haunted House #10 (1978) * Superman: The Man of Steel Gallery #1 (pin-up) (1995) * Who's Who in the DC Universe (Man-Bat profile) #12; (Blackfire profile) #13 (two pages each) (1991) ====Marvel Comics==== * The Avengers Annual #10 (1981) * Bizarre Adventures #25, 28 (1981) * Daredevil vol. 2 #65 (five pages, among other artists) (2004) * Defenders #53\u201354 (among other artists) (1977) * Doctor Strange #46, 55 (1981\u20131982) * Epic Illustrated #3\u20134, 32 (1980\u20131985) * Fantastic Four Roast #1 (two pages, among other artists) (1982) * G.I.
