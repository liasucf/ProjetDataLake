There are two trains, which are launched by a flywheel track. The sidecars were initially designed to be in the middle of the trains. Riders are held on the ride through a clamshell restraint system, where the top part of the bike folds over the rider's legs. The ride has two cameras: one on the launch run, the other halfway through the ride. The ride's queue features informational decorations that teach about the history of motorcycle racing. Riders must be in height to ride on the main motorcycle cars and tall to ride in the sidecars. The ride is estimated to handle 746 passengers per hour, and has a launch speed of in two seconds due to its hydraulic system, the second of its kind worldwide. ==See also== * Jet Rescue ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Roller coasters introduced in 2007 Category:Roller coasters in Australia Category:Roller coasters operated by Ardent Leisure Category:Dreamworld (Australian theme park) ",
