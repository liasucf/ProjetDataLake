Dhritiman Chatterjee portrayed the protagonist character of Professor Shanku. The film released theatrically on 20 December 2019. ==Plot== This is an adventure story of the fictional genius scientist and inventor Professor Shanku visiting the heart of the Amazon forests in search of the mythical city of El Dorado. One day, a typical Bengali gentleman Nakur Chandra Biswas alias Nakur Babu comes to meet him in Shanku's house in Giridih. He lives in Makardaha. Shanku realises that Nakur Babu has supernatural power having the ability to read other's minds and see the future. Nakur Babu warns him about the upcoming incidents of Sau Paulo. Seeing his extrasensory power, an amazed Shanku goes to Brazil with Nakur Babu to join a science conference and the mystery begins ending in the fabled city of El Dorado deep inside the Brazilian Amazon ==Cast== * Dhritiman Chatterjee as Professor Shanku * Subhasish Mukhopadhyay as Nakur Babu *Eduardo Munniz as Lobo *Ricardo dantas as Jeremy Saunders *Roney Facchini as Wilhelm Krol *Jacqueline Mazarella as Professor Emilia Rodriguez *Augusto Cesar as Hyter *Meyerbeer Tapaj\u00f3s as Mike * Felipe Montanari as Bob *Fernando Coelho as Solomon Bloomgarten *Udayshankar Pal as Prahlad *Subhrajit Dutta as Samaresh *Ratan Sarkhel as Tarak ==Reception== The Times of India gave the film 3 stars out of five and said, \"Despite a perfect look and sharp glances, Dhritiman remains less convincing as Shanku. An indefinable stiffness engulfs his performance that questions the spontaneity of the character. Meanwhile, Subhashish too goes overboard with emotion as Nakurbabu. The film involves a lot of foreign actors and they deliver a decent performance. The overall CGI also appears to be a bit flimsy. In children\u2019s literature, Shanku makes a clean sweep with his scientific masterstrokes. However, his on-screen journey starts with a bumpy ride. Let\u2019s hope for a better future for him.\" Firstpost gave the film 3 stars out of five and said,\"One of the distinguishing features of anything Satyajit Ray has ever written is the conciseness of it all. There is always something happening. Each page, each sentence is loaded with information, and often as the story progressed, a certain sense of urgency crept in. It is this sense of urgency that is missing in Sandip Ray\u2019s screenplay.\" The Indian Express Bangla gave the film 3 and a half stars out of five.https://www.bengali.indianexpress.com/entertainment/bengali-film- professor-shonku-o-el-dorado-review-172758/lite/ ==References== ==External links== * Category:Indian children's films Category:Bengali-language films Category:Indian films Category:Films based on Indian novels Category:Films directed by Sandip Ray Category:2010s science fiction adventure films Category:Indian science fiction adventure films Category:2010s Bengali- language films Category:2019 films ",
