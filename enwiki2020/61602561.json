The dj's of NPO Radio 2 awarded Amy the TopSong of the week immediately after this performance. The single was well received in the domestic as well as foreign press. The Belgian music site \"Dansende Beren\" in a review: \"Jett Rebel plays a catchy pop song that is the result of a minimalist line-up. However, he makes that minimalism shine, adds his voice to it and you have the recipe for success. On June 8, 2018, Jett Rebel released his second single Good Boy. Two days later, a music video followed. NPO Radio 2 named Good Boy to 5 star track on June 18, 2018 and NPO 3FM makes Good Boy the new 3FM Megahit on June 22, 2018. Two Good Boy remixes followed on July 13, 2018. These remixes were provided by Emiel van den Dungen and Ferry Strange. Van den Dungen is a cousin of Rebel and rumor has it that Strange is a pseudonym of Rebel himself. The last single of the album was Perfect Lady, which was released on September 7, 2018. On this day the album cover was also shown to the public on which a naked Rebel can be seen on a pink satin sheet. The accompanying music video was released on September 26, 2018. ==Recording== The album was recorded in Rebel's own analogue studio: Gold Foil Studio, Nunspeet.

Lennart Koster in review for Nieuweplaat felt \"About 7 we can be brief: Jett Rebel did it. A banger of a record, with which he both returns to the music he made years ago, and manages to surprise. With 7 the singer shows us what he has to offer, and that's a lot. The whole package is exactly what the album was supposed to be', Tuinstra said in an interview with the ANP and it has indeed become a total package\".https://www.nieuweplaat.nl/album/jett-rebel-7/ The editors of Timpaan Muziek gave rebel an 8.7 as a rating and felt about 7: \"With Amy and (Again) Girl Rebel has a great opening of this record. Funky, rousing rhythms and supple melodies are also reminiscent of Stevie Wonder at times of Songs in the Key of Life. And before you know it you have a record full of references to musical heroes, but one that has nothing of its own. Jett Rebel knows how to avoid that pitfall. He makes a record that is unmistakably his own. The temptation is great to give Jett Rebel a 7, but that would do the record an injustice. 7 is a wonderful, world-class album.\" The album was in the Dutch Album Top 100 for three weeks, foreign listings are unknown. ==References== Category:Jett Rebel albums Category:2018 albums ",
