He went on to play in seventy-three games for the club, whilst also scoring five goals in Primera D Metropolitana. G\u00e1speri went up to Primera B Metropolitana in 2003, signing for Brown. One goal in sixty-four matches in two seasons followed. Stints with San Telmo and Luj\u00e1n, of Primera C Metropolitana, then occurred for G\u00e1speri, as the defender appeared ninety times for the two sides. In 2008, G\u00e1speri joined Estudiantes. Two hundred and ten appearances and eight goals came across six campaigns in tier three, with his last goal coming in a win away to Deportivo Armenio on 13 April 2013. On 30 June 2014, G\u00e1speri moved across Primera B Metropolitana to join Deportivo Mor\u00f3n. He was sent off in his second match for them, receiving a red card after fifty-nine minutes of a fixture with Los Andes. Deportivo Mor\u00f3n won promotion to Primera B Nacional in 2016\u201317, though G\u00e1speri had departed midway through the season after agreeing terms with former team Brown. He made twenty-three appearances in his second spell. In July 2018, Acassuso completed the signing of G\u00e1speri. His bow arrived on 9 October versus UAI Urquiza, with his opening goal coming days later in a 2\u20131 loss to Estudiantes; another ex-club of G\u00e1speri's. ==Personal life== G\u00e1speri's brother, Federico, also played football at a professional level. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"1\"|San Telmo |2005\u201306 |rowspan=\"3\"|Primera B Metropolitana |15||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||15||0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Estudiantes |2012\u201313 |31||3||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||32||3 |- |2013\u201314 |28||1||5||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||33||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !59!!4!!6!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!65!!4 |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Deportivo Mor\u00f3n |2014 |rowspan=\"4\"|Primera B Metropolitana |12||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||12||0 |- |2015 |32||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||3Appearance(s) in the Primera B Metropolitana play-offs||0||35||0 |- |2016 |15||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||16||0 |- |2016\u201317 |8||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||8||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !67!!0!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!3!!0!!71!!0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Brown |2016\u201317 |rowspan=\"2\"|Primera B Nacional |11||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||11||0 |- |2017\u201318 |9||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||3Appearance(s) in the Primera B Nacional play-offs||0||12||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !20!!0!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!3!!0!!23!!0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Acassuso |2018\u201319 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera B Metropolitana |19||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||19||1 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !180!!5!!7!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!6!!0!!193!!5 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:People from Campana, Buenos Aires Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Primera D Metropolitana players Category:Primera B Metropolitana players Category:Primera C Metropolitana players Category:Primera B Nacional players Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Puerto Nuevo players Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Brown footballers Category:San Telmo footballers Category:Club Luj\u00e1n footballers Category:Estudiantes de Buenos Aires footballers Category:Deportivo Mor\u00f3n footballers Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Acassuso footballers ",
