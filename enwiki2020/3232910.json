King, Radiohead, R.E.M., Deftones, Soulfly, Steve Vai, and Neil Young have recorded at the studio. ==History== In 1991, Nancy and Ann Wilson of the band Heart entered into a partnership with Steve Lawson, who owned Kaye-Smith Studios where many of their 1970s hits, as well as their 1980 album B\u00e9b\u00e9 le Strange, had been recorded. They upgraded the facility to the state-of-the-art, and renamed it Bad Animals Studio. The studio was named after Heart's 1987 album, Bad Animals. Ann and Nancy sold the studio back to the Lawsons in 1997, and it was renamed Studio X. In May 1993, Nirvana entered Bad Animals Studios to remix the songs \"Heart-Shaped Box\" and \"All Apologies\" for their album In Utero.Azerrad, 1994. p. 337\u201338 The music video for Soundgarden's 1994 single \"Fell on Black Days\" was filmed at the studio.
