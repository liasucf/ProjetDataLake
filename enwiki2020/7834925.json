He was subsequently elected Governor when then-Governor Gray Davis was successfully recalled and served the remainder of Davis' term between 2003 and 2007. Schwarzenegger was then reelected to a second term in 2006 to serve his first full term between 2007 and 2011. Schwarzenegger was unable to run for a third term due to term limits imposed by Constitution of California, but has still been involved in politics and the promotion of environmentalism. == Early politics == Schwarzenegger with President Ronald Reagan at the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas In Austria, Schwarzenegger was officially a member of the youth weightlifting team of the Austrian People's Party (\u00d6VP).

On September 7, 2007, Schwarzenegger said, \"I am proud to be a member of the party of Abraham Lincoln. I am proud to be a member of the party of Ronald Reagan.\" In the documentary, Pumping Iron, Schwarzenegger said, \"I was always dreaming about very powerful people\u2014dictators and things like that.

The New Yorker's Connie Bruck called Schwarzenegger \"supermoderate\". Andrew Gumbel of The Independent wrote, \"[Schwarzenegger is] a man of surprises. He mixes in the social circles of Hollywood's liberal elite...yet he has always regarded himself as a staunch Republican\u2014among other things, an act of rebellion against the staunch social democratic values of his native Austria.\" Los Angeles Times writer Joe Mathews wrote that Schwarzenegger routinely sides with business and asserts quasi- libertarian views on individual freedom but has crossed borders and associated with groups whose experiences seem foreign to his own. Daniel Weintraub of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, \"[Schwarzenegger] is liberal on some issues, conservative on others and, sometimes, but not always, in the middle.\" Rob Long, a television writer and producer, wrote on NPR that Schwarzenegger is a \"Hollywood Republican, meaning he's mellow about gays and abortion and marijuana\". Civil rights attorney Shannon Minter of the National Center for Lesbian Rights gave Schwarzenegger a B- grade on gay and lesbian issues, calling his decision not to appeal Perry v. Schwarzenegger, which struck down Proposition 8, \"a really quite dramatic stand for a Republican governor to have taken.\" === Scales and rankings === In October 2003, On The Issues rated Schwarzenegger as a \"moderate liberal populist\". In April 2008, the organization reclassified Schwarzenegger as a \"centrist\".
