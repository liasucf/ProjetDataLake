SDASSDAS Kinglist, tablet IM 60484, ii 28. and NassouhiNassouhi Kinglist, Istanbul A. 116 (Assur 8836), ii 32.) agree on.

Evidence of his construction activities survives, with four short inscriptions commemorating work building the temple of Bel-ibr\u012bia on bricks recovered from an old ravine, restoring the Abaru forecourt and rebuilding the S\u00een-\u0160ama\u0161 (Moon-god/Sun-god) temple, called the \u00e9.\u1e2b\u00fal.\u1e2b\u00fal.dir.dir.ra, \u201cHouse of Surpassing Joys,\u201d which would be later restored by Tukulti-Ninurta I and A\u0161\u0161ur-n\u0101\u1e63ir-apli II. He ruled in a peaceful and uneventful period of Assyrian history following the overthrow of the Babylonians and Amorites by Puzur-Sin c. 1732 BC and the rise of the Mitanni in the 1450s BC. He was succeeded by his son Puzur-A\u0161\u0161ur III. ==Inscriptions== ==References== Category:16th-century BC Assyrian kings Category:Assyrian kings Category:16th-century BC rulers ",
