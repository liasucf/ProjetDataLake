FN Herstal's firearms are used by the militaries of over 100 countries. ==History== 1913 FN motorcycle with four-cylinder in-line engine and shaft drive 1931 FN cabriolet FN Browning Hi-Power pistol FN Herstal originated in the small city of Herstal, near Li\u00e8ge. The Fabrique Nationale d'Armes de Guerre (French for National Factory of Weapons of War) was established in 1889 to manufacture 150,000 Mauser Model 89 rifles ordered by the Belgian Government. FN was co- founded by the major arms makers of the Li\u00e8ge region, with Henri Pieper of Anciens Etablissements Pieper being the driving force and the primary shareholder of the new company. In 1897, the company entered into a long- lasting relationship with John Moses Browning, a well-known American firearms designer. FN was an important manufacturer of motor vehicles in Belgium, a development championed by Alexandre Galopin as managing director. Cars were produced in Herstal in the early 1900s until 1935. Production of FN motorcycles continued until 1965, and production of trucks until 1970. In 1973, FN changed its name to reflect a product line diversified far beyond just \"weapons of war\", adopting the current name of Fabrique Nationale d'Herstal.Stevens, R. Blake The Browning High Power Automatic Pistol. Collector Grade Publications (1990). . One of Fabrique Nationale's handguns, a Model 1910 semi-automatic pistol in 9\u00d717mm (.380 ACP) (serial number 19074) was one of four weapons that were taken from the assassins of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, although it is unknown which of the four weapons fired the fatal round. Browning began development of the GP35 \"High Power\" pistol, the GP standing for Grande Puissance (French for high power), which is well- known as the Browning Hi-Power. The weapon was finalized by FN's Dieudonn\u00e9 Saive and did not appear until 1935, nearly a decade after Browning's death; it remained in production until 2017. The FN Manufacturing LLC plant in Columbia, South Carolina, is part of the military division of FN. It is primarily responsible for the production of U.S. military weapons, such as M16 rifles, M249 light machine guns, M240 machine guns, and M2 machine guns. ==Weapons== Mitrailleuse d\u00b4Avion Browning - F.N.
