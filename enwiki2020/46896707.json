Chenillo is the first female filmmaker to have directed a Best Picture-winning film at Mexico\u2019s Ariel awards. She accomplished that feat with her bitingly funny Cinco d\u00edas sin Nora, a comedy about the five days following Nora\u2019s suicide which she\u2019d planned to bring her family back together. And while she\u2019s tried her hand at TV (directing episodes of Soy tu fan and Netflix\u2019s Club de Cuervos) she followed up her critically acclaimed film with Para\u00edso a look at what happens when a couple moves from the middle-class suburban area of Naucalpan to Mexico City proper, which is bustling and stressful. ==Selected filmography== * Para\u00edso (Paradise) (2013) * Revoluci\u00f3n (2010) * Nora's Will (Cinco d\u00edas sin Nora)(2008) ==References== ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Mexican film directors ",
