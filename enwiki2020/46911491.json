    "text": "Love in Every Port (Spanish:En cada puerto un amor) is a 1931 American drama film directed by Carlos F. Borcosque and Marcel Silver and starring Jos\u00e9 Crespo, Conchita Montenegro and Juan de Landa. It is the Spanish-language version of Way for a Sailor directed by Sam Wood. Translating and altering the original script was overseen by Edgar Neville, a Spaniard with strong connections in the United States, and was part of a trend of making multiple language versions during the early years of sound before dubbing became more commonplace.Bentley p.51 ==Cast== * Jos\u00e9 Crespo as Jack * Conchita Montenegro as Elena * Juan de Landa as Tripode * Romualdo Tirado as Timon * Elena Landeros as Margot * Rosita Granada as Lulu == References == ==Bibliography== * Bentley, Bernard.
