It serves especially as a tourism hub for those who visit the Pacific coast and western Costa Rica. The airport is named for Daniel Oduber Quir\u00f3s, who served as president of Costa Rica from 1974 to 1978. The airport is west-southwest of the city of Liberia in Guanacaste Province. The Liberia VOR-DME (Ident: LIB) is located on the field. ==History== Main building interior, passenger check- in area. The idea for an airport in Guanacaste Province was initially conceived during the government of Daniel Oduber Quir\u00f3s (1974\u20131978). The airport was initially named \"Llano Grande\", due to the name of the area that it was built in. It would later be named \"Aeropuerto Tomas Guardia,\" and the last name it received is that of ex-president Daniel Oduber Quir\u00f3s, in honour of his work for the province of Guanacaste. However, most people call it \"Liberia International Airport\". In October 1995 the airport was re- inaugurated as an international airport. To support this expansion of operations, the pavement on the runway was redone and special landing lights were installed. Also a firefighter station was added to comply with FAA and international regulations. Initial response from commercial airlines to the expansion was timid; however, after one year the airport went from having only one weekly charter flight to one almost every day. In 2006, to manage increased demand of the airport, the government and local tourism chamber boards set aside funds to increase the parking capacity of the tarmac from five to eight airplanes, and for the construction of a parallel taxiway. However, the government made it clear that the solutions were only temporary and that a private company would need to be contracted to expand and operate the airport in the future. Also in 2007 a new waiting area and airport counters were opened, the airport was by then receiving more than 180,000 visitors yearly. ==Expanded terminal and new operator== The government of Costa Rica awarded CORIPORT, S.A., a 20-year concession to design, finance, construct and operate a new terminal building and its associated landside facilities, as well as approximately of airport land currently occupied by the existing terminal and associated facilities. CORIPORT's shareholders include MMM Aviation Group, Emperador Pez Espada S.R.L., Inversiones Cielo Claro LTDA, Cocobolo Inversiones S.R.L., and ADC&HAS; Airports Worldwide who is also the project's operator. The new terminal building, encompassing approximately , features a contemporary design that both increases efficiency and capacity over the existing facility. Construction started on 19 October 2010; the terminal opened on 12 January 2012. Further expansion of the terminal commenced in January 2017 and was completed in November; the expansion adds capacity for the airport to receive 5 new airlines. ==Airlines and destinations== ==Statistics== Daniel Oduber Quir\u00f3s International airport is the country's second and Central America's sixth busiest airport. In 2019, Liberia International Airport reported the passenger's record. {| style=\"border:solid 1px #aaa;\" cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\" |+ LIR passenger totals, 2000\u2013present (thousands) |- | ImageSize = width:auto height:250 barincrement:29 PlotArea = left:35 bottom:15 top:10 right:15 AlignBars = justify Period = from:0 till:1500 TimeAxis = orientation:vertical Colors = id:gray value:gray(0.5) id:line1 value:gray(0.9) id:line2 value:gray(0.7) ScaleMajor = start:0 increment:250 gridcolor:line2 ScaleMinor = start:0 increment:125 gridcolor:line1 PlotData= color:blue width:20 bar:2000 from:start till:91 bar:2001 from:start till:87 bar:2002 from:start till:62 bar:2003 from:start till:98 bar:2004 from:start till:204 bar:2005 from:start till:303 bar:2006 from:start till:392 bar:2007 from:start till:423 bar:2008 from:start till:443 bar:2009 from:start till:396 bar:2010 from:start till:311 bar:2011 from:start till:540 bar:2012 from:start till:669 bar:2013 from:start till:680 bar:2014 from:start till:780 bar:2015 from:start till:878 bar:2016 from:start till:1146 bar:2017 from:start till:1092 bar:2018 from:start till:1117 color:darkblue bar:2019 from:start till:1149 |- |Source: Directorate General of Civil Aviation |} Current domestic routes from LIR.
