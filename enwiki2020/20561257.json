    "text": "Kathryn Stott (born 10 December 1958)Morrison B. \"Stott, Kathryn\" in Grove Music Online (Oxford University Press) (accessed 8 December 2008) is a British classical pianist who performs as a concerto soloist, recitalist and chamber musician. Her specialities include the English and French classical repertoire, contemporary classical music and the tango. She teaches at the Royal Academy of Music and Chetham's School of Music, and has organised several music festivals and concert series. Grove Music Online describes Stott's playing as \"marked by a vivid sense of immediacy and personal communication.\" A review of her fiftieth birthday gala concert in The Times describes her as \"one of the most versatile pianists on the circuit\".Morrison R. Kathryn Stott Gala at Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool. The Times (8 December 2008) (accessed 8 December 2008) ==Early life and education== Stott was born in Nelson, Lancashire. Her mother was a piano teacher and she began to learn the piano at the age of five.Church M. Many hands make light work. Independent (4 February 2000) (accessed 5 December 2008) She attended the Yehudi Menuhin School, where her teachers included Nadia Boulanger, Marcel Ciampi, Barbara Kerslake and Ravel specialist, Vlado Perlemuter, and then studied at the Royal College of Music with Kendall Taylor.Royal Academy of Music: Kathryn Stott (accessed 5 December 2008) ==Performance and recording career== Stott's career as a soloist was launched after she gained fifth place in the Leeds International Piano Competition in 1978.Leeds International Pianoforte Competition: Previous Finalists (accessed 5 December 2008) Her London d\u00e9but was at the Purcell Room the same year. She has since toured throughout Europe, Asia, America and Australia with a concert repertoire that encompasses concertos, solo piano music and chamber music. She is unusual in always performing from a score. Stott has a particular affinity with English music, and her series of recordings of works by Frank Bridge, George Lloyd, John Ireland and William Walton is described as \"distinguished\" in Grove. She is also known for her love of French music, particularly the works of Gabriel Faur\u00e9, whose complete piano works she has recorded to critical acclaim. Contemporary classical music is another of Stott's specialities. She has given the first performances of many works, including a concerto by Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Michael Nyman's The Piano Concerto and Graham Fitkin's Circuit (with Noriko Ogawa).Nyman M, sleeve notes of The Piano Concerto & MGV (Argo; 1994) Since the mid-1990s, she has also been interested in tango and other Latin dance music, which she describes as \"primitive music, hard to place, both abrasive and tender\".Stott K. I've been tangoed. Guardian (29 November 2008) (accessed 5 December 2008) Stott first met her long-time collaborator, the noted American cellist Yo-Yo Ma, in 1978 when she \"discovered a Chinese man in his underpants playing the cello\" in her flat after returning from holiday. (Ma had rented the flat from Stott's flat-mate, violinist Nigel Kennedy, without realising that it was shared). Stott and Ma have worked together since 1985; the pair frequently tour together and have made several joint recordings, including Soul of the Tango and Obrigado Brazil, which received Grammy Awards in 1999 and 2004. She also has long-standing collaborations with cellists Truls M\u00f8rk, Christian Polt\u00e9ra and Natalie Clein, violinist Janine Jansen, and pianist Noriko Ogawa.Kathryn Stott: Pianist: Biography (accessed 8 December 2008) ==Artistic direction== Stott has directed several successful music festivals and concert series in the north of England. In 1995, she organised a Faur\u00e9 festival in Manchester to mark the composer's 150th anniversary. According to the Independent, the event was \"transformed by her enthusiasm and her own sumptuous performances of this neglected composer's works.\" The success of the festival led to her appointment as Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government.Kathryn Stott: Pianist: Artistic Director (accessed 8 December 2008) She directed two major piano festivals at the Manchester Bridgewater Hall in 2000 and 2003. As Stott considers \"It's very important at an event like this that we should let people play\", both festivals featured multiple Steinway grands that the public were allowed to try, as well as a variety of novelty pianos including a red \"Ferrari\" Steinway, an \"exploded\" piano revealing the internal workings, a grove of woven pianos, and a concert grand fitted with a pool which played a variety of watery sounds.Ward D. Piano hits right note for festival. Guardian (5 December 2002) (accessed 9 December 2008) In 1998, Stott directed a concert series \"Out of the Shadows\" with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, featuring two neglected female composers, Clara Schumann and Fanny Mendelssohn. More recently, she has directed the series \"Chopin: The Music and the Legacy\" at Leeds College of Music (2004\u201305) and \"Paris\" at the Sheffield Crucible (2006).
