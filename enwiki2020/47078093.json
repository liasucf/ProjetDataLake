He previously played for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Farmer made his major league debut on July 30, 2017. ==Career== ===Amateur sports=== Farmer graduated from the Marist School in Atlanta, Georgia, where he played baseball and football. While at Marist, Farmer appeared in the major Hollywood film The Blind Side (2009), playing a high school quarterback. During his college baseball career at the University of Georgia (UGA), Farmer played shortstop, hitting for a .308 batting average and recording a .968 fielding percentage, a UGA Bulldogs Baseball team record at the shortstop position. In 2011, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Bourne Braves of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Farmer was originally drafted by the New York Yankees in the 35th round of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign. He was then drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 8th round (244th overall pick) of the 2013 Major League Baseball draft and signed a contract with the team. ===Minor leagues=== The Dodgers made the decision to convert Farmer into a catcher. In 2014, he made his pro baseball debut with the Ogden Raptors of the Pioneer League, then was promoted to the Great Lakes Loons of the Midwest League, later that year. After 57 games with Great Lakes \u2014 where he hit .310 \u2014 Farmer was promoted again to the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes of the California League, where he batted .238 in 36 games. Farmer began 2015 with the Quakes, where he was selected to the mid-season All-Star team. Farmer did not play in the game due to his subsequent promotion to the Double-A Tulsa Drillers of the Texas League. Farmer was selected to represent the Dodgers organization at the All-Star Futures Game, in 2015. He played in 76 games for Tulsa and hit .272. Farmer returned to Tulsa to start the 2016 season and was selected to the mid- season all-star game. He played in 74 games for the Drillers in 2016, hitting .256 with five home runs and 31 runs batted in (RBI). The Dodgers added Farmer to their 40-man roster, after the season. He was promoted to the Triple-A Oklahoma City Dodgers during the 2017 season. ===Major leagues=== ====Los Angeles Dodgers==== Farmer was first called up to the big leagues, on July 28, 2017. Two days later, in his first major league at bat, Farmer hit a walk-off two-run double off of Albert Su\u00e1rez of the San Francisco Giants, in the bottom of the 11th inning, giving the Dodgers a 3\u20132 win. Farmer appeared in 20 games for the Dodgers in 2017, primarily as a pinch hitter, and had six hits in 20 at-bats (.300). He made the Dodgers roster for the 2017 NLDS and 2017 NLCS, having four at bats as a pinch hitter, without recording a hit. In 2018 Farmer appeared in 24 games in the field for the Dodgers, 22 of them at third base. He posted a stat line of .235/.312/.324 in 68 at bats. ====Cincinnati Reds==== On December 21, 2018, the Dodgers traded Farmer to the Cincinnati Reds, along with Yasiel Puig, Alex Wood, Matt Kemp, and cash considerations in exchange for Homer Bailey, Jeter Downs, and Josiah Gray. ==Personal life== Farmer proposed to his girlfriend, Courtney Sayre, in July 2017. (Originally published on August 4, 2017.)
