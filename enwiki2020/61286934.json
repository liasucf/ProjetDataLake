Also described in the book is the carret designed by Carvalho for transportation. In the hinterland, the Imperial Commission traveled 113 kilometers in 126 days to the train station. From there they embarked for Salvador \u2013 a distance of 363 kilometers \u2013 and arrived in the capital of Bahia on 22 May 1888. Heavy, the meteorite was then 5,360 kg.
