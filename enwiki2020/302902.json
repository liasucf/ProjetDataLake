Today it is nearly extinct, and fewer than 100 people still speak it.Stina Sieg, \"Do You Harp A Slib Of The Ling? One Small Town's Opaque Language\" at NPR.org, 17 January 2015 It has an IANA sub-tag of `boont` (i.e. en- boont).https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language- subtag-registry ==History and description== Although based on English, many of Boontling's unusual words are unique to Boonville, California. Scottish Gaelic and Irish, and some Pomoan and Spanish words also contribute to this jargon.Haddock, Vicki. \"Hamlet's Dying Lingo\" in San Francisco Chronicle, February 5, 2001. Boontling was invented in the late nineteenth century and had quite a following at the turn of the twentieth century. It is now mostly spoken by aging counter-culturists and native Anderson Valley residents. Because the town of Boonville has only a little more than 700 residents, Boontling is an extremely esoteric jargon, and is quickly becoming archaic. It has over a thousand unique words and phrases. ===Origins=== The Anderson Valley, of which Boonville is the largest town, was an isolated farming, ranching, and logging community during the late nineteenth century. There are several differing versions as to the origin of Boontling. Some assert that the jargon was created by the women, children, and young men in the hop fields and sheep shearing sheds as a means of recreation, and that it spread through the community as the children continued using it when they grew up.A Little Boont at the Anderson Valley Museum Myrtle R. Rawles explains that Boontling was started by the children of Boonville as a language game which enabled them to speak freely in front of elders without being understood.Rawles, Myrtle R. (1967); Boontling: The Strange Boonville Language. Mendocino Historical Society, p.3 It is believed that the jargon originated from Ed (Squirrel) Clement and Lank McGimsey, circa 1890. ===Documentation=== Based on interviews of family and neighbors, Rawles wrote an article, \"'Boontling': Esoteric Speech of Boonville, California,\" published in 1966 by the California Folklore Society (presently Western States Folklore Society) in Western Folklore, Volume 25, No. 2, and reprinted under the title Boontling, or the strange Boonville language by the Mendocino County Historical Society in 1967.Boontling, or the strange Boonville language at Amazon.com Researcher Charles C. Adams studied the lingo in the 1960s and wrote a doctoral dissertation based on his research. In 1971 University of Texas Press published his book, Boontling: an American Lingo, which included an extensive dictionary.\"Hamlet's Dying Lingo\" in San Francisco Chronicle Boontling briefly enjoyed a national audience in the mid-1970s when a Boontling speaker named Bobby (Chipmunk) Glover was a regular guest on the well-known The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson on the NBC television network. Boontling historian Jack (Wee Fuzz) June appeared on the game show To Tell the Truth and was so well known by this point that panelist Kitty Carlisle had to disqualify herself from the judging. Because Boontling is a spoken jargon rather than a written one, spellings of its words vary greatly. Most spellings were not formalized until the 1970s, primarily by the writings of Jack (Wee Fuzz) June. ==A== * abe \u2013 to butt or crowd in so as to push a person out of line and take his or her place. * airtight \u2013 a sawmill. * applehead \u2013 a young girl; girlfriend or wife. * ark \u2013 to wreck something: an anagram, probably from \"wreck\". ==B== * back-dated chuck \u2013 a person who is ignorant or behind the times * bahl \u2013 good, great * bahlness \u2013 a very attractive woman * barlow \u2013 a knife: taken from the trade name Barlow knife. * bat \u2013 to masturbate. * batter \u2013 a bachelor; a masturbator. * bearman \u2013 a story teller: Allen Cooper, an innkeeper, who was a bear hunter and a story teller. * beelch \u2013 sexual intercourse. * beemsch \u2013 good show: a blend of bahl (good) and show. * beeson tree \u2013 a stock saddle: Beeson was a trade name. * beeljeck \u2013 a rabbit: a blend of Belgian hare and jack rabbit. * belhoon \u2013 a dollar. * bilch \u2013 sexual intercourse. * Bill Nunn \u2013 syrup; a sobriquet: Bill Nunn put syrup on nearly everything he ate. * bird- stock \u2013 a man with a large family. * blooch \u2013 to prattle on, to talk aimlessly. * bloocher \u2013 a 'bullshitter'; also, a masturbator. * blue-birded \u2013 to be bucked off a horse: One of the boys got bucked off a horse and afterwards *said, \"I got thrown so high that a blue-bird could have built a nest on my ass.\" * blue grass \u2013 whiskey. * blue-tail \u2013 a rattlesnake. * boo \u2013 a potato.
