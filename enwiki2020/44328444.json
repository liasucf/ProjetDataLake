K. undertook the film's cinematography and editing respectively. After being in pre-production phase since March 2014, principal photography began on 5 November 2014 and lasted till 15 March 2015. The film was shot in and around Chennai and Tuticorin. Maari was released on 17 July 2015, coinciding with Ramzan festival. The film received mixed reviews upon its release, but had a decent collection at the box office. It was dubbed in Telugu as Maas and was released on 29 April 2016, and was remade in Bengali as Bossgiri (2016). A sequel titled Maari 2 was released on 21 December 2018. == Plot == Police Constable Arumugam (Kaali Venkat) talks to the new Sub-Inspector, Arjun (Vijay Yesudas), about Maari (Dhanush), a local rowdy who rose to fame after killing a rival rowdy. Maari is an irritating guy, who, along with his henchmen Sanikilamai (Robo Shankar) and Adithangi (Kalloori Vinoth), constantly pesters the people in the area and extorts money from them. His main line of work is in training racing pigeons. His boss is Velu (Shanmugarajan), a bigger don who also is involved in the pigeon races, as well as the smuggling of sandalwood. Maari constantly has fights with \"Bird\" Ravi (Mime Gopi), another local rowdy who is also working under Velu. One day, a lady named Sridevi (Kajal Aggarwal) enters the business, trying to open a boutique in Maari's area. Maari forcefully becomes her partner in the business, which angers her after she loses some customers. She decides to help Arjun catch Maari by getting close to him, pretending to fall in love with him, and incriminating him with evidence of his confession: he had tried to kill the rival rowdy, but failed. She shoots the talk with Maari in the drunken state, who describes about the murder, saying that somebody else had killed him, and he took the credit. Maari is soon arrested by Arjun. Seven months later, when he is released, he finds out that Velu also has been arrested, Arjun is actually a corrupt cop, and he and Ravi are working together and have arrested some people in the area under the pretext of smuggling, to extort money. Maari decides to take revenge on the duo. He first frees the local people from the extortion by Ravi's gang, while Sridevi also falls in love with him for real. Later, Maari captures one of Arjun's smuggling vehicles and the driver, by which he forces Arjun to release Velu. When Arjun takes revenge by burning Maari's pigeon coop, which kills 10 of his pigeons, he gets angry and beats up Ravi and Arjun, with the former agreeing to confess to everything. Angered, Arjun stabs Ravi but eventually gets arrested by the Revenue Department after Aarumugam reveals all of his secrets. Finally, Sridevi approaches Maari to confess her love to him, which he rejects, returning to pester the local people and extort them for cash. == Cast == *Dhanush as \"Maari\", a local gangster who pesters the citizens in the Chennai vicinity and extorts money from them *Kajal Aggarwal as Sridevi, an entrepreneur who starts a business in Maari's land *Vijay Yesudas as Inspector Arjun Kumar, a police officer who wants to get rid of Maari to take charge of his land *Kalloori Vinoth as Robert (Adithangi), Maari's henchman *Robo Shankar as Sanikilamai, Maari's henchman *Kaali Venkat as Aarumugam, a constable who works for Arjun but supports Maari in the end *Mime Gopi as \"Bird\" Ravi, a local gangster who wants to get rid of Maari with Arjun *Shanmugarajan as Velu Anna, a local underworld don *Sriranjini as Sridevi's mother *Supergood Subramani as TV Shop Owner * Azhagu as Anbu * Sampath Ram as Pandi * Prem as Prem * Kamalesh Kumar * Chelladurai * George Vijay Nelson * Sharmila * Sharath * Raja Rani Pandian *Anirudh Ravichander as himself (Guest appearance) * Baba Bhaskar (special appearance in the song \"Maari Thara Local\") *Balaji Mohan in a cameo appearance == Production == === Pre- production === The collaboration between Listin Stephen and Raadhika's production house and director Balaji Mohan was first revealed in early January 2014, with Dhanush and Kajal Aggarwal being signed on to be a part of the \"romantic entertainer\". The first look poster released later indicated that Dhanush was a co-producer of the film. Mohan wanted the film not to be a bilingual like his previous ventures as he found the process difficult to shoot the same shot twice and to retain the same energy in both of them. He said in an interview in March 2014 that he narrated a one-liner to Dhanush, on whose consent, he would develop the complete script after releasing Vaayai Moodi Pesavum (2014), adding that this film would \"definitely not be a love story\".

Kajal Aggarwal, who was supposed to work with Dhanush in Polladhavan (2007), was cast on Dhanush's insistence, who wanted to gain a foothold in Telugu cinema by cashing in on Aggarwal's stardom there. She said in an interview that she overcame her fear of birds due to her experiences with pigeons during the film's shoot. Although Kajal Aggarwal was signed during the film's initial stages of production, she joined the sets in November 2014.
