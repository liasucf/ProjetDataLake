    "text": "Greatest Hits, Vol. 1 is a greatest hits compilation released in October 2004 by American nu metal band Korn. The album features select tracks from their first six studio albums presented in reverse chronological order. There are two previously unreleased songs on the compilation: a cover of Cameo's \"Word Up!\", and a compilation of all three parts of Pink Floyd's \"Another Brick in the Wall\" and \"Goodbye Cruel World\". These were the final songs recorded with their full original lineup as their former guitarist Brian Welch, who leaves the band shortly after the album's release in February the following year, until his return in 2013. Greatest Hits, Vol. 1 debuted and peaked at number four on the Billboard 200, achieving a Platinum certification by the RIAA. For unspecified reasons Korn left off three of their hits, \"Thoughtless\", \"No Place to Hide\" and \"Good God\" but included songs \"Trash\" and \"Twist\" on the album, though neither were released as singles. The version of \"Freak on a Leash\" on this album features an extended intro. Because of this, the back cover lists the length of the track as being 4:15 (the length of the album version on Follow the Leader), when the length of the version on this album is 4:27. ==Track listing== ===Bonus DVD: Live at CBGB's (Limited edition only)=== ===Charts=== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (2004) !Peak position |- |Australia (ARIA) |align=\"center\"|8 |- |Austria (\u00d63 Austria Top 40) |align=\"center\"|10 |- |Belgium (Ultratop Flanders)Peak chart positions for Korn in Belgium: * * |align=\"center\"|35 |- |Belgium (Ultratop Wallonia) |align=\"center\"|38 |- |Canada (Jam!
