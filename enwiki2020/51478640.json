    "text": "The lakes Les Laussets (French: Lacs Les Laussets) are a group of three lakes in the Tin\u00e9e valley, Alpes-Maritimes, Alps, France. They are located at an elevation of 2400 m, south-east to the Cr\u00eate des Terres Rouges, and close to the T\u00eate des Mourres. Of note, a group of lakes can be found in the vicinity of the lakes Les Laussets: the lakes of Morgon. ==Itinerary== On the way of the Col de la Bonette from the Saint-\u00c9tienne-de-Tin\u00e9e side, two main itineraries are possible. ===From the Hameau du Pra=== From the hamlet of Pra, follow the trail that goes up in the south-facing slope, and reach the small plateau of Morgon. Quit the marked route leading to the forest house of Tortisse, and climb in the valley of Morgon, find a pastoral hut and then walk through a scree slope. On the left, climb the rocky spine to find a secondary valley. Follow the small torrent and then reach the lakes Laussets. ===From the Camp des Fourches=== From the Camp des Fourches, go to the Col des Fourches. Follow the GR 5 to go down in the Cougnas ravine. Leave the GR at tag 37 (2100 m), cross a ravine, and follow on the right the small footpath in the Cabane valley, along the Salso Moreno torrent. Enter a small rocky gorge on the right, and find the Big Lake of Morgon. From there, walk west to reach the three lakes Les Laussets. ==References== ==External links== * Location of the lakes Les Laussets on a geographical map, G\u00e9oportail (IGN).
