    "text": "Compsaraia samueli is a species of apteronotid electric fish that exhibits pronounced sexual dimorphism in which mature males develop extremely elongated snouts and oral jaws. This phenotype is found in several other apteronotid species and is used in agonistic jaw-locking behaviors between males. A study comparing skull shape and jaw-closing performance in males and females of Compsaraia samueli suggested that males with elongated faces for use in fights also had lower mechanical advantages, indicating a trade-off between sexual weaponry and jaw leverage. ==References== Category:Fish described in 2009 Category:Electric fish Category:Apteronotidae ",
