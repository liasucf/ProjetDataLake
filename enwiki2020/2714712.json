He joined Norwich City in March 2000 on a free transfer. The following season he made 6 starts and 6 substitute appearances. He also scored his first goal for the club in a 1\u20130 home win against Wolverhampton Wanderers. The following season he scored 10 goals as Norwich reached the final of the Division One play-offs. In the 2002\u201303 campaign he was the club's top scorer with 15 goals.

The following season he scored 5 goals in over 40 appearances and helped Norwich win promotion to the FA Premier League. During the 2004\u201305 season in the Premier League, McVeigh made 20 first team appearances, and his highlight was when he scored at Old Trafford in Norwich's first away game. McVeigh was made available for transfer by manager Nigel Worthington at the start of the 2005\u201306 season although towards the end of 2005 injuries forced Worthington to start McVeigh. McVeigh played incredibly well for the remainder of the season scoring vital goals at Leeds, Leicester and Sheffield United. This helped gain him the player of the month award in December and January and he signed a one-year contract extension. He started off the 2006\u201307 season from the bench but got a run in the team by October. McVeigh made a bad first impression on new manager Peter Grant when he was sent off for headbutting in injury time during the 1\u20130 win over Cardiff. McVeigh got very few opportunities under Grant and was loaned out to Burnley for the last few months of the season where he scored 3 goals helping them to survive in the championship. McVeigh was released by Norwich at the end of the 2006\u201307 season. In July 2007 McVeigh trained with the Italian Serie B side PisaFlown From the Nest \u2013 Paul McVeigh before Plymouth Argyle manager Ian Holloway gave him a trial with a view to signing him.

He featured in the game against Bradford City on 4 October, and then played regularly until late December, scoring his first goal for the club in the 2\u20131 victory against Dagenham & Redbridge. On 19 May 2009 he began a short trial with MLS team San Jose Earthquakes in a bid to gain a contract after being released from Luton on a free transfer.

McVeigh made his second debut for Norwich in their 5\u20132 victory over Wycombe.
