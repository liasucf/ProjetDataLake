    "text": "In the thirteen years the Weimar Republic was in existence, some forty parties were represented in the Reichstag. This fragmentation of political power was in part due to the peculiar parliamentary system of the Weimar Republic, and in part due to the many challenges facing German democracy in this period. ==Weimar political parties== ===Left-wing=== *Kommunistische Arbeiter-Partei Deutschlands (KAPD) -- Was an ultraleftist party that split from the KPD in 1920. They rejected participation in the Parliament and called for immediate revolutionary action. Immediately after its formation the party endured a series of splinters and lost much of the little influence it had. *Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands (KPD) -- Formed out of a number of left- wing groups, including the left wing of the USPD and the Spartacist League. It was a Marxist-Leninist party that advocated revolution by the proletariat and the creation of a communist regime according to the example of the Soviet Union. The party's major paper was the Die Rote Fahne (The Red Flag). (Against the government) *Vereinigte Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands (VKPD) (Against the government) *Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands (Opposition) (KPO) -- Split from the KPD in 1928, representing the \"Right Opposition\" of the Bukharinist against the Stalinist \"Center\" and the Trotskyist \"Left Opposition\". It never intended to be a real political party, but to influence the KPD. *Unabh\u00e4ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (USPD) --, \"Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany\" - left wing faction that had split from the SPD in 1917. Parts of it split off, forming the Communist Party, while the majority reunited with the MSPD in 1922. It was a Marxist party that sought change through parliament and social progressive programs. (later splinter party) (Against the government) *Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands (SAPD) --, \"Socialist Workers' Party of Germany\" - left wing faction that had split from the SPD in 1931. Parts of the USPD and dissenters from the KPD and the KPO joined it, but it remained small. Its political positions were near to those of the USPD, wavering between the SPD and the KPD. (splinter party). *Sozialistischer Bund (splinter party). *Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (SPD) -- (between 1917 and 1922 also called Mehrheitssozialdemokratische Partei (MSPD) - Majority Social Democrats); they supported the parliamentary system of democracy, and extensive social programs in the economy. Its party newspaper was the Vorw\u00e4rts. (Pro-Weimar Republic) ===Centre=== *Deutsche Demokratische Partei (DDP) -- German Democratic Party. A social-liberal party. One of the two main liberal parties. Their party newspapers were the Vossische Zeitung and the Volkswacht. (Pro-Weimar Republic) *The German State Party (DStP) -- Formed in 1930 by the DDP, the People's National Reich Association and remains of the Christian Trade Unionists. In 1930, it published a \"Manifesto of the German State Party\". (Pro-Weimar Republic) *Wirtschaftspartei.

It established two labor unions; one for the blue-collar worker (the DNAB) and one for the white-collar worker (DNAgB), which had been politically unimportant. The DNVP was the main authoritarian right party of Weimar Germany, but moved to the radical right after coming under the control of press baron Alfred Hugenberg in 1928. It organized the National Opposition in 1929, together with leaders of the Stahlhelm, Dr. Schacht, the president of the central bank and Hitler's Nazi Party, to oppose Chancellor Hermann M\u00fcller's Grand Coalition.
