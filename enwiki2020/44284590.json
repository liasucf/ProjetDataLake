    "text": "Professor Shazia Sadiq is a computer scientist based in Queensland, Australia. == Background == Originally from Pakistan, Shazia was one of a handful of women to undertake studies in a computer science program within Pakistan at Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan in 1980s, and wrote her first computer program in Fortran using punched cards. Later she received a NORAD scholarship to undertake masters in computer science from the Asian Institute of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand. She then went on to do a PhD in Information Systems at the University of Queensland, Brisbane Australia, with Professor Maria Orlowska. Since 2001 Sadiq has been based in the School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, at the University of Queensland, which she conducts research and teaching in databases and information systems. She serves as deputy chair on the Australian Academy of Science\u2019s National Committee on Information and Communication Sciences and formerly as vice president of the Asia Pacific Chapter of IQ International - the International Association of Information and Data Quality. == Education == * Doctor of Philosophy (The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia, 2002)Researcher Profile Retrieved 12 August 2014 * Masters in Computer Science (Asian Institute of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand, 1993) * Masters in Computer Science (Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan, 1989) ==Research and Advocacy== Sadiq\u2019s research is focussed on developing innovative solutions for Business Information Systems. She has published over 100 publications in prestigious journals and conferences such as SIGMOD, VLDBJ, TKDE, WWWJ, ISJ, CAiSE, ER, and BPM.Publications Record. Retrieved 12 August 2014 and received grants. Her work on declarative modelling of complex and dynamic business requirements has been applied in the areas of business process management, and GRC (governance, risk and compliance) with close to a 1000 citations on the collective works. Sadiq is leading a world-class group of researchers and students in the area of big data quality and integration with novel applications in transportation, social media and learning analytics. In addition to the research work, Sadiq also contributes to the professional community of data and information quality professionals through her role as a board member of the AsiaPacific Chapter of the International Association of Information and Data Quality and as convener of the Queensland Data Quality Roundtable. Sadiq has also contributed to the enhancement of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) education for the last fifteen years. She has devoted considerable energy towards raising awareness of the importance of ICT skills for a number of disciplines, while ensuring that ICT students are equipped with the knowledge and confidence to tackle the rising challenges of a constantly evolving ICT landscape and a data driven society. Her teaching innovations have been recognized through publications in leading conferences and journals, leadership roles at national and international ICT educational forums and University awards for teaching excellence. Sadiq is an active supporter of initiatives towards improving female participation in ICT. She developed an interactive workshop series, which has been delivered to over a thousand high school students since 2006. The aim of the initiative is to promote interest in ICT related study and professional pursuits especially for female students. The basic rationale behind the design of the workshops is to demonstrate computing principles and techniques by masking them in various socially relevant applications such as health, forensics, genetics, fashion, movie making, game design, environment modeling etc. Sadiq also gives role model talks; and participates in various girls in ICT events, such as \u201cGIDGITS\u201d and \u201cTechnology Takes You Anywhere\u201d. ==Awards== * Women in Technology Award for InfoTech Research 2012 * The University of Queensland Award for Teaching Excellence 2012Winner: 2012 UQ Award for Teaching ==External links== * Professor Shazia Sadiq, Australian Academy of Science * * ==References== Category:Australian women scientists Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
