    "text": "On the Ropes is the debut album by British electronica duo Mint Royale, released in 1999 on the Faith & Hope label. In June 2001, a new version of the album was published for the U.S. market by MCA Records, featuring a different cover (with a close-up photo of a pinball machine) and a different track list.
