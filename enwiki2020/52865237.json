Amygdalus davidiana, Persica davidiana, Prunus persica var. davidiana) is a species in the genus Prunus in the family Rosaceae. It is also known by the common names David's peach and Chinese wild peach. It is native to China, preferring to grow in forests and thickets, on slopes in mountain valleys, and in waste fields, from 800 to 3200m. It is resistant to frost, and to a number of pests and diseases of cultivated peach, and is the subject of many studies for the genetic improvement of peaches. ==Description== Deciduous, upright tree. *Height and Spread: Reaches a maximum height and spread of 9 m (30 ft) by 9 m (30 ft). *Branches: Young branches whippy, upright, and smooth. *Bark: smooth, dark purplish-red *Leaves: Dark green, glabrous leaves are lanceolate-narrow ovate in shape, ranging in length from 5\u201312 cm (2\u20135 in).
