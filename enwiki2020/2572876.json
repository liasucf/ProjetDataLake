Her missions included enforcement of all U.S. maritime laws and treaties, fisheries conservation, marine pollution response, defense readiness, and search and rescue. Chase was one of the first naval vessels built with a combined diesel and gas turbine propulsion plant. Chases engineering plant includes two diesel engines, and two gas turbines, which can achieve a top speed of . Two diameter controllable pitch propellers, combined with a retractable and rotatable bow propulsion unit, giving Chase high maneuverability. Chases capabilities are enhanced by advanced air search and surface search radars including the AN/SPS-73 digital surface radar system that incorporates a state of the art computerized collision avoidance system. Chase uses the Shipboard Command and Control System (SCCS) which uses a network of computers including large screen displays and a dedicated satellite network for communications. A closed circuit TV system will enable the commanding officer to monitor flight deck operations, machinery conditions, towing, damage control, and related activities from the bridge. ==Vietnam and the 1970s== After being commissioned in 1968, Chase participated in Operation Market Time.

In 1989, Chase was temporarily decommissioned and entered Bath Ironworks Shipyard in Portland, Maine, to undergo the Fleet Renovation and Modernization (FRAM) program. At Bath, Chase was virtually torn apart and reassembled with substantial improvements to many of her systems. Approximately seventy five percent of the shipboard electronics were changed or modified; a third of the existing engineering systems were overhauled or replaced; and major internal space reconfigurations improved the crew\u2019s living conditions. ==1990s== On March 22, 1991, Chase returned after completing FRAM, and was recommissioned.
