    "text": "Debuccalization or deoralization is a sound change or alternation in which an oral consonant loses its original place of articulation and moves it to the glottis (usually , , or ). The pronunciation of a consonant as is sometimes called aspiration but in phonetics, aspiration is the burst of air accompanying a stop. The word comes from Latin , meaning \"cheek\" or \"mouth\". Debuccalization is usually seen as a sub-type of lenition, often defined as a sound change involving the weakening of a consonant by progressive shifts in pronunciation. As with other forms of lenition, debuccalization may be synchronic or diachronic (i.e., it may involve alternations within a language depending on context or sound changes across time). Debuccalization processes occur in many different types of environments such as the following: * word- initially, as in Kannada * word-finally, as in Burmese * intervocalically, as in a number of English varieties (e.g. litter ), or in Tuscan (the house /la kasa/ \u2192 [la \u02c8ha\u02d0sa]) ==Glottal stop== ===Arabic=== is debuccalized to in several Arabic varieties, such as northern Egyptian, Lebanese, western Syrian, and urban Palestinian dialects, partially also in Jordanian Arabic (especially by female speakers). The Maltese language, which was originally an Arabic dialect, also shows this feature. ===British and American English=== Most English-speakers in England and many speakers of American English debuccalize to a glottal stop in two environments: in word-final position before another consonant (American English IPA) *get ready *not much *not good *it says and before a syllabic following , , , or a vowel. Here the may also be nasally released. (American English IPA) *Milton *Martin *mountain *cotton *Latin ===Cockney English=== In Cockney English, is often realized as a glottal stop between vowels, liquids and nasals (notably in the word bottle), a process called t-glottalization. ===German=== In German, voiceless stops are commonly debuccalized before syllabic nasals in the following clusters: , which thus become . For example, (\u201crags, tatters\u201d) is pronounced . In some dialects, debuccalization may also occur before syllabic , though this is less common. Voiced stops are not usually debuccalized. However, many Upper German and East Central German dialects merge voiced and unvoiced stops at least word- internally and these merged consonants will be debuccalized. Thus in Bavarian, (\u201cducks\u201d) and (\u201cAndes\u201d) are both pronounced . Speakers are often unaware of this. ==Glottal fricative== ===Slavey=== All coda consonants in Slavey must be glottal. When a non-glottal consonant would otherwise be positioned in a syllable coda, it debuccalizes to : * \u2192 ('hat') * \u2192 ('scar') * \u2192 ('rope') ===Scots/Scottish English=== In some varieties of Scots (and Scottish English), particularly on the West coast, a non word-final th shifted to , a process called th-debuccalization. For example, is realised as . ===Proto- Greek=== In Proto-Greek, shifted to initially and between sonorants (vowels, liquids and nasals). * Proto-Indo-European \u2192 Ancient Greek () \"seven\" (vs. Latin ) Intervocalic was lost by the time of Ancient Greek, and vowels in hiatus were contracted in the Attic dialect. * post-PIE *\u01f5\u00e9nesos \u2192 Proto-Greek \u2192 Ionic () : Attic () \"of a race\" Before a liquid or nasal, an was assimilated to the preceding vowel in Attic-Ionic and Doric and to the following nasal in Aeolic. The process is also described as loss of and subsequent lengthening of a vowel or consonant to keep the syllable the same length (compensatory lengthening). * PIE \u2192 Proto-Greek \u2192 Attic-Ionic () : Aeolic () \"I am\" ===Sanskrit=== In Sanskrit, becomes (written in transliteration) when utterance-final, e.g., \"erotic love\" becomes . Additionally, the Indo-European aspirated voiced palato-velar *\u01f5\u02b0- became , e.g. \"arm\" becomes Sanskrit . ===West Iberian=== ====Spanish==== A number of Spanish dialects debuccalize at the end of a syllable to or . ====Galician==== In many varieties of Galician as well as in Galician-influenced Spanish, the phoneme may debuccalize () to in most or all instances, though and are also possible realizations. There is also an inverse hypercorrection process of older or less educated Galician speakers replacing the phoneme of the Spanish language by , what is called . ====Portuguese==== Portuguese is much less affected by debuccalization, but it is especially notorious in its Brazilian variety. All over Brazil, the phoneme (historically an alveolar trill that moved to an uvular position) has a rather long inventory of allophones: . Only is uncommon. Few dialects, such as and , give preference to voiced allophones; elsewhere, they are common only as coda, before voiced consonants. In such dialects, especially among people speaking an educated variety of Portuguese, it is usual for the rhotic coda in the syllable rhyme to be an alveolar tap, as in European Portuguese and many registers of Spanish, or to be realized as or . In the rest of the country, it is generally realized as , even among speakers not normally using this allophone or deleting it entirely, as is common in the vernacular. However, in some - and -influenced rural registers, is used but as an allophone of (rhotic consonants are most often deleted), a merger, instead of the much more common and less stigmatized merger characteristic of all Brazilian urban centers except for those bordering Mercosur countries, where coda was preserved, and the entire North and Northeast regions. Its origin is the replacement of indigenous languages and by Portuguese, which created , and r-colored vowel as allophones of both (now mostly ) and (now mostly ) phonemes in the coda since Natives could not easily pronounce them (caipira dialect). The later Portuguese influence from other regions made those allophones become rarer in some areas, but the merger did not disappear in a few isolated villages and towns. Finally, many registers, especially those of the poor and of the youth, most northern and northeastern dialects, and, to a much minor degree, all other Brazilian dialects, debuccalize (that is, ) but less so than in Spanish. However, a merger or even a merger occurs: \"but even so\" or \"though, right, the same (f) one\" ; light \"lighter, more slim\", or also \"less caloric/fatty\" ; \"but from me, no\" or \"not more from me\" . A coda rhotic in the Brazilian dialects in the Centro-Sul area is hardly ever glottal, and the debuccalized is unlikely to be confused with it. ===Romanian=== In the Moldavian dialect of Romanian, is debuccalised to and so, for example, becomes . The same occurred in Old Spanish, Old Gascon and Old Japanese and occurs today in Sylheti. ===Goidelic Languages=== In Scottish and Irish Gaelic, s and t changed by lenition to , spelled sh and th. ==Loanwords== Debuccalization can be a feature of loanword phonology. For example, while Korean allows certain coda obstruents, Japanese does not. Those consonants realized in Korean as unreleased voiceless stops () may be realized in Japanese as glottal stops: * \u2192 ('porridge') * \u2192 ('neck') * \u2192 ('flavor') *\u2192 ('tower') Similarly, debuccalization can be seen in Indonesian loans into Selayar. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * ==External links== * \"Debuccalization\" (Chapter 4 of Paul D. Fallon's The Synchronic and Diachronic Phonology of Ejectives [Routledge, 2001]) gives many other terms that have been proposed for the phenomenon. * Debuccalization and supplementary gestures Category:Phonology ",
