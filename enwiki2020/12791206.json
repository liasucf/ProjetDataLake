    "text": "Turandot or the Whitewashers' Congress is an epic comedy by the German modernist playwright Bertolt Brecht. It was written during the summer of 1953 in Buckow and substantially revised in light of a brief period of rehearsals in 1954, though it was still incomplete at the time of Brecht's death in 1956 and did not receive its first production until several years later.Kuhn and Constantine (2004, 252). It premi\u00e8red on 5 February 1969 at the Z\u00fcrich Schauspielhaus, in a production directed by Benno Besson and Horst Sagert, with music by Yehoshua Lakner.Kuhn and Constantine (2004, xxii). The story is loosely based on Count Carlo Gozzi's commedia dell'arte play Turandot (1762), a production of which Brecht saw in Moscow in 1932, directed by Yevgeny Vakhtangov.Brecht's library contains a copy from 1925 of Gozzi's play, in a German translation by Karl Vollmoeller. Yevgeny Vakhtangov's production in 1932 treated the play as a grotesque farce. See Kuhn and Constantine (2004, 250-251). From 1930 onwards, Brecht began to develop a version of his own, which became part of a wider complex of projects exploring the role of intellectuals (or \"Tuis,\" as he called them) in a capitalist society.Kuhn and Constantine (2004, 250-251). Brecht's word \"Tui\" is a neologism that results from the acronym of a word play on \"intellectual\" (\"Tellekt-Ual-In\"). The material that Brecht developed in the mid-1930s for his so-called Tui-Novel\u2014a satire on intellectuals in the German Empire and Weimar Republic\u2014also belongs to this complex of projects. See Kuhn and Constantine (2004, xix, 251). Brecht's protagonist is coarse, lacking the whimsical charm of Gozzi's portrayal and the aspiration to nobility in Schiller's adaptation (1801).Thomson (1994, 25). The play consists of 27 subdividing pictures in 10 major scenes. Its plot is about how to explain high cotton prices, although of a vast harvest. The prize for best explanation is Turandot. The big topic is the abuse of intellectual skills. The play had its British premi\u00e8re in an amateur production in 1970 and a professional production at the Oxford Playhouse in 1971.Jacobs and Ohlsen (1977, 88, 91). ==Notes== ==Sources== * Brecht, Bertolt. 2004.
