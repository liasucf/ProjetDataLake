    "text": "Auburn Tunnel was a 19th-century canal tunnel built for the Schuylkill Canal near Auburn, Pennsylvania. It was the first transportation tunnel in the United States. The tunnel was deliberately added to the canal as a novelty, as the hill it was bored though could have easily been bypassed. It became a major attraction, with people traveling over upriver from Philadelphia to see it. It was periodically shortened, and in 1857 was daylighted to become an open-cut. == See also == * Montgomery Bell Tunnel \u2013 a slightly earlier aqueduct tunnel in the United States * Staple Bend Tunnel \u2013 the first railroad tunnel in the United States == References == Category:Canals in Pennsylvania Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania Category:Tunnels in Pennsylvania Category:Schuylkill River Category:Tunnels completed in 1821 Category:Canal tunnels in the United States Category:Water transportation in Pennsylvania Category:1821 establishments in Pennsylvania ",
