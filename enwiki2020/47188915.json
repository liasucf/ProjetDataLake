    "text": "W213 Facelift The Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W213 and S213) series represent the fifth-generation of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class range of executive cars, including sedan (W213) and station wagon (S213) configurations. Sold from 2016 (as a 2017 model), it is the successor to the W212/S212 E-Class models. Unlike the previous generation, this generation coupe/convertible share the same platform as the sedan/wagon. The high-performance Mercedes-AMG E 63 and E 63 S versions of the W213 has been available as well from 2016 (as a 2017 model). Since the mid 1990s, the Mercedes-Benz E-Class had been equipped with quad headlights and a differentiated design compared to the C-Class and S-Class. With the 2017 model, Mercedes decided to take a more streamlined direction, first seen with the 2014 E-Class mid-generational refresh and then going in an entirely new direction with the all-new 2017 model. Launched in spring 2016 following a world debut at the 2016 North American International Auto Show in January, the 2017 E-Class was the most technologically advanced car Mercedes had ever produced at the time. == Development and launch == The whole development process stretched over 48 months. In that time, Mercedes-Benz produced 1,200 prototypes and drove a combined 12 million kilometres in some of the world's toughest conditions, from sub-zero temperatures in the snow through to the world's hottest deserts.http://www.carscoops.com/2015/12/mercedes-benz-has-tested- upcoming-e.html In testing the car, Mercedes-Benz also had its prototypes conduct over 10,000 autonomous braking procedures and 5,000 automated lane changes as part of the Distronic suite of semi-autonomous driving features.http://www.motortrend.com/news/watch-the-2017-mercedes-benz-e-class- undergo-extreme-testing/ Moreover, it took 1,200 engineers to make the fifth- generation E-Class. After Mercedes-Benz invested close to \u20ac1 Billion into the development of the extensive refresh to the 2014 mid-life facelift of W212 E-Class, the W213 E-Class was unveiled at the 2016 North American International Auto Show. The 2017 E-Class has a design similar to that of the larger W222 S-Class and the smaller W205 C-Class. While its predecessor had a tighter surface and harder edges, the 2017 model is curvier and more flowing. An official design sketch was released in late December 2015, which confirmed that the new E-Class mirrors the styling of the C-Class and S-Class. Official photos of the 2017 E-Class were leaked on the internet on 4 January 2016 ahead of its unveiling.http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1101673_2017-mercedes- benz-e-class-leaked The W213 was first released in the saloon configuration, which went on sale in the summer 2016. The Estate, offering a similar 695-litre luggage capacity to its predecessor, went to sale towards the end of 2016. A two-door Coupe arrived in 2017, before the Convertible completes the line-up towards the end of 2017. The W213 E-class was deemed one of Car and Driver's \"10 Best vehicles\" in 2019. == Design == File:2018 Mercedes-Benz E 300 (W 213) sedan (2018-11-02) 03.jpg| Sedan (W213) File:Mercedes-Benz E-Class V213 02 China 2017-03-30.jpg|Sedan (long wheelbase) (V213) 2020-09-22 MB-E200 W213-MOPF.jpg| Sedan Facelift (W213) File:2017 Mercedes-Benz E220d AMG Line Premium Estate 2.0 Rear.jpg| Station wagon (S213) File:2017 Mercedes-Benz E220d AMG Line Premium+ 2.0 Rear.jpg| Coupe (C238) File:2017 Mercedes-Benz E220d AMG Line Cabriolet Rear.jpg| Cabriolet (A238) Stylistically, the 2017 E-Class followed the latest C-Class, the GLA, and the S-Class coup\u00e9. Its front end features Mercedes\u2019 familiar bullet-shaped headlights and an upright grille, while its rear end gets a pair of LED taillights, with similarities to the 2014 E-Class models,http://www.gtspirit.com/2015/11/02/next-gen-mercedes- benz-e-class-spied-almost-undisguised/ that extend into the quarter panels. As on other recent models, the 2017 E-Class features two distinct front-end treatments: a traditional chrome grille and a more sporting blade grille. The aerodynamic efficiency have been refined as the drag coefficient improved from 0.25 in the previous model to a class-leading 0.23. === W212 facelift comparison === The W213 adopts Mercedes\u2019 modular MRA platform, as used by the contemporary C-Class and S-Class models. The W213 E-Class grew 43 mm in length to . Wheelbase was also extended 65 mm to , resulting in shorter overhangs. It is 2 mm narrower and 6 mm lower than its predecessor. The increased use of high-strength steel and aluminium is claimed to make the car up to 100 kg lighter than the W212 E-Class. The W213 E-Class is based on the F800 Style design language, previously used on the larger W222 S-Class (2013) and the smaller W205 C-Class (2014). However, the facelifted W212 (2013) also incorporates several design cues from the F800 Style, thus the two vehicles share several design traits.http://indianautosblog.com/2016/01/mercedes-e- class-w213-vs-w212-old-vs-new-210378 The W213 E-Class' front bumper is reminiscent of the facelifted W212's optional sport kit (dubbed the AMG Sports Package), as it is governed by two air intakes united by a mesh grille. Compared to the standard front bumper of the W212, which is similar to the one used on the W205 C-Class, the W213 E-Class' proposal is more aggressive, composed and simple.http://www.carscoops.com/2016/01/evolution-or-revolution- new-vs-old.html The classic iconic grille, has simpler, flowing lines, with a more imposing presence on W213, while the sport variant (with the big logo in the middle) isn't so different from the W212. The S-Class inspired, sweptback (first time in Mercedes executive-class history) and rather compact headlights are the styling feature of the W213 model. On both cars the doors sit pretty high, squeezing the windows, but the W212 masks this \"trait\" with a subtle slope towards the headlights. In fact, on the profile of the facelifted W212, it still retains the edgy lines that came out in 2009. At the back, the W213 adopted a fresh design for the lights similar to the S-Class. However, the tailpipes finishers are similar to the ones found on the W212, with the rear bumper keeping its overall shape. === Interior === The interior with two 12.3-inch full HD screens housed within a single unit. The interior of the 2017 E-Class was unveiled by Mercedes-Benz in December 2015, which was previewed on the Concept IAA (Intelligent Aerodynamic Automobile) that Mercedes showed in September 2015 at the Frankfurt Auto show. The interior mounts two 12.3-inch full HD screens housed within a single unit. Most E-Class models receives the widescreen set-up as standard. However, base Avantgarde versions features traditional analogue dials with a seven-inch multi- information display, along with an 8.4-inch central infotainment screen. Mercedes-Benz claimed a first for the automotive industry, adding a pair of touch-sensitive control buttons on the steering wheel, which respond to finger swipes to control the car's infotainment system. The more traditional Command controller is also retained on the centre console. == Equipment == The W213's technology was previewed at a technical presentation in July 2015. The launch of the 2017 E-Class saw Mercedes move a step closer to autonomous driving, with nine all-new or comprehensively updated driver assistance systems to feature. The car took many of the features seen in the latest S-Class and took them on to a new level. === Autonomous driving === A number of sensors, cameras and radars has allowed semi-automated driving. There may be fewer sensors and cameras than before (12 and four respectively over the W212 model), but they all feature increased functionality which reduces cost and complexity. The next level of Drive Pilot (code-named Intelligent Drive) featured on the 2017 E-Class enables the car to negotiate bends on the motorway, while maintaining a safe distance from slower moving vehicles in front at up to speeds of . The system is not a hands free operation and an audible alert will prompt the driver into regaining control if the car detects their attention has wandered. The Steering Pilot function uses visible road markings to navigate bends at speeds of up to . The car is able scan the surrounding area as well as the car in front if road markings are unclear to maintain lane discipline. The system is also able to automatically increase or decrease the E-Class's speed by reading speed limit signs if the driver fails to take any action. === Safety innovations === Active Brake Assist and Evasive Steering Assist work in tandem to warn of and prevent potential collisions in the 2017 E-Class. The first system now features increased functionality, able to provide visible warning of potential danger as well as being able to automatically apply the brakes in an emergency. The system is now also able to detect and analyze moving traffic at junctions ahead. Evasive Steering Assist can detect when a driver is making an evasive action and apply additional steering force to ensure the pedestrian or vehicle is avoided. Car-to-X Communication is another safety system which enables vehicles on the same road to warn each other of upcoming potential hazards or accidents. If an unavoidable side collision is detected, PRE-SAFE Impulse Side rapidly inflates the side bolster to move the occupant away from the point of impact, while at the same time PRE-SAFE Sound pumps noise waves through the speakers to reduce hearing damage following a collision. === Mobile connection === A brand new remote parking smartphone app, called Remote Parking Pilot, will allow drivers to park their vehicle from outside of the car to allow for easier ingress and egress. The system only works at very low speeds of 2 mph, with the vehicle also able to lock, unlock and start itself from the app. Another new smartphone feature is Digital Car Key, which allows the driver's smartphone to be used as a vehicle key - essentially replacing a conventional key fob. The system uses near field communication which also allows the car to be locked and unlocked even if the phone is out of battery. === Adaptive LED Matrix Lighting === Adaptive LED Matrix Lighting Introduced on the CLS for 2014, Mercedes\u2019 Multibeam LED headlamps are enhanced for the 2017 E-class. The individual LED count increases from 24 to 84, each individually controllable\u2014switching between high- and low-beams, and the curve-following adaptive-lighting functions are now achieved entirely via electronics. The light pattern is also altered in city driving or via information from the navigation system (such as when approaching intersections). Additionally, the light unit glows blue. As with the mid-cycle refresh of W212, the 2017 E-Class features two larger units instead of the four-eyes headlights, though unique LED light bars within the headlamps still gives the night-time effect of four individual units. Prior to its world debut, a teaser video previewing the car's multibeam LED headlamps was released in January 2015. === Drift Mode === Introduced in the Mercedes-AMG E 63 S 4MATIC+, drift mode allows the car to completely cut the front axle from its all-wheel-drive 4MATIC system and transfer all and of torque to the rear axle of the car. This allows the driver to engage in easier drifts due to the nature of the rear wheel drive function. To enable drift mode, the driver must select Race mode, turn ESP off, and put the automatic gearbox into manual shifting. Next, the driver must pull both the paddles towards them and an option for drift mode arises. To fully enable drift mode, the driver must pull the right paddle and drift mode is now enabled. Drift mode can be equipped with E-Class AMG models only. == Variants == === Estate/All-Terrain === In a departure from previous generations, the Estate is offered in two distinct variants: a traditional on-road model and an All-Terrain version to directly rival the Audi A6 Allroad and Volvo V90 Cross Country.https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-paris-motor- show/mercedes-e-class-all-terrain-estate-revealed Unveiled at the 2016 Paris Motor Show, the Estate All-Terrain features a 29 mm higher ride height due to the Air Body Control air suspension (15 mm) and 20 in wheels fitted as standard (14 mm). There is also external plastic cladding to protect the body from scratches and scrapes, as well as the 4Matic permanent four-wheel-drive system with 31/69 front-rear torque split. === E 300 (2016-) === An E 300, with a 2.0-litre turbo petrol engine, will join the range at launch. This engine was previously available in the facelift W212 E-class in some markets. This engine produces in the E 200, in the E250 and in the E 300. Like the W212 facelift, the W213 E 300 produces and and accelerates from 0\u2013100 km/h (62 mph) in 6.2 seconds. === E 350 (2019-) === An E 350, with an updated 2.0-litre turbo petrol engine, will join the range for the 2020 model year. This engine is also used in the facelift W205 C-Class and X253/C253 GLC-Class, as well as the W167 GLE-Class. In the E 350, it produces at 5,800 - 6,100 RPM, with an additional if paired with EQ Boost, and at 3,000 - 4,000 RPM. It has a 0- acceleration time of 5.9 seconds.https://www.mercedes- benz.co.id/passengercars/being-an-owner/brochure-price/md- saloon/_jcr_content/par/interactions.attachments.1.E-Class_W%20123_E200_E300_E350_Brochure_Tablet.pdf === E 400 (2016-) === An E 400 with a 3.0-litre turbo M276 V6 petrol engine. It is carried over from the W212 facelift E class and it produces and of torque. It accelerates from 0\u2013100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.9 seconds, a full second faster than the E 300. === E 400 Wagon (2016-) === E 400 Wagon An E 400 with the same 3.0-litre M276 V6 petrol engine as the sedan version. This car share many similarities with the E 400 sedan but shows differences in its styling and engine. Unlike the E 400 sedan's single turbo engine, the E 400 wagon is equipped with a twin turbo V6 producing and of torque. The main difference seen in this particular model is the fact that it has an increased cargo area. The E 400 wagon has a maximum space of 64.3 cubic feet of load space compared to with 57.4 in the sedan version. The E 400 wagon can also be equipped through options with third row seating allowing more passengers to ride in the car. It can sprint from 0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 5.1 seconds and do the quarter mile in 13.7 seconds at due to its 4MATIC all wheel drive system. === E 450 (2019-) === A more powerful 3.0 liter V6 engine with output of 362 PS and 51kgm; otherwise similar to the E 400. For the 2020 Facelift, the E450 has updated its powertrain to the new 3.0L Inline 6 turbo with EQ Boost. The horsepower is the same at 362PS and 51kgm === E 350e Plug-in Hybrid (2016-) === E 350e Plug-in Hybrid The E 350e is a plug-in hybrid, equipped with a turbocharged inline-four coupled with an electric motor between the engine. The E 350e's transmission is a nine-speed automatic gearbox. Mercedes claims that the car has a electric only range. The hybrid plug to charge the car is connected on rear bumper through a small door similar to how the gas door is setup. The E 350e can sprint from 0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 6.2 seconds. Mercedes claims the E 350e weighs about , compared to the E 300's weight of . The way to distinguish an E 350e from a non-hybrid E 300 is the badging. An E 350e badge is placed on the rear trunk as well as a blue \"Plug-in Hybrid\" on the side of the car. Mercedes offers an option to paint the brake calipers the same blue as the \"Plug-in Hybrid\" as well. == Engines (2017\u20132020) == Engine options for the 2017 E-Class saw a major update, thanks to the switch to inline-6 engines from the current V6 engines, along a new generation of four- cylinder diesel engines (OM654) and existing four-cylinder petrol engines (M274). All engines, save for the AMG V8, come standard with Mercedes\u2019 9G-Tronic nine-speed automatic gearbox; the AMG V8 uses a 9-speed AMG Speedshift gearbox. Until April 2018, the E 200 was available with a 6-speed manual transmission in Europe, but it was discontinued and 9G-Tronic became standard. Alongside standard rear-wheel drive, select engines are offered with optional four-wheel drive. In 2020, Mercedes-Benz launched the E 180 model utilizing the M274 DE16 LA engine in select markets, such as the Philippines and Singapore. {| class=\"wikitable\" !Model!!Years!!Configuration!!Displacement!!Power!!Torque!!0\u2013100 km/h (0-62 mph)!!Top speed |- ! colspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:center\" |Petrol engines |- |E 180 (Asia) |2020-||Inline-4||1595 cc||||||8.6 s||226 km/h (140 mph) |- |E 200||2016-2019||Inline-4||1991 cc||||||7.7 s|| 240 km/h (149 mph) |- |E 200 |2019- |Inline-4 + 48V Mild Hybrid (EQ Boost) |1991 cc | | |7.5 s |240 km/h (149 mph) |- |E 250||2016-2020||Inline-4||1991 cc|||||| 6.9 s | 250 km/h (155 mph) (electronically limited) |- |E 300||2016-||Inline-4||1991 cc||||||6.3 s|| 250 km/h (155 mph) (electronically limited) |- |E 300e||2019-||Inline-4 PHEV||1991 cc||||||5.4 s|| 250 km/h (155 mph) (electronically limited) |- |E 350||2019-||Inline-4 + 48V Mild Hybrid (EQ Boost)||1991 cc||||||5.9 s|| 250 km/h (155 mph) (electronically limited) |- |E 350e||2016-2020||Inline-4 PHEV||1991 cc||||||6.2 s|| 246 km/h (153 mph) (electronically limited) |- |E 400||2016-2018||V6||2996 cc||||||5.2 s|| 250 km/h (155 mph) (electronically limited) |- |E 450 |2019- |V6 |2996 cc | | |5.6 s |250 km/h (155 mph) (electronically limited) |- |AMG E 43||2016-2018||V6||2996 cc||||||4.6 s|| 250 km/h (155 mph) (electronically limited) |- |AMG E 53||2018-||Inline-6 + 48V Mild Hybrid (EQ Boost)||2999 cc||||||4.5 s|| 250 km/h (155 mph) (electronically limited) |- |AMG E 63||2016-||V8||3982 cc||||||3.5 s|| 250 km/h (155 mph) (electronically limited) |- |AMG E 63 S||2016-||V8||3982 cc||||||3.4 s|| 300 km/h (186 mph) (electronically limited) |- |- ! colspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:center\" |Diesel engines |- ||E 200d||2016-||Inline-4||1950 cc||||at 1,400\u20132,800||8.4 s || 224 km/h (139 mph) |- ||E 220d||2016-||Inline-4||1950 cc||||at 1,600\u20132,800||7.3 s || 240 km/h (149 mph) |- ||E 300de||2018-||Inline-4 PHEV||1950 cc||||at 1,700\u20133,300||5.7 s || 250 km/h (155 mph) |- ||E 350d||2016-2018||V6||2987 cc|||| at 1,600\u20132,400||5.9 s || 250 km/h (155 mph) |- ||E 350d||2018-||Inline-6||2925 cc|||286 PS (210 kW; 282 bhp)||at 1,200\u20133,200||5.7 s || 250 km/h (155 mph) |- ||E 400d 4MATIC||2018-||Inline-6||2925 cc|||||at 1,200\u20133,200||5.1 s || 250 km/h (155 mph) |} ^ - Only available in selected markets, including but not limited to - Philippines, Singapore. ==Mercedes-AMG models == === AMG E 43 (2016\u20132018) === The all-wheel-drive only Mercedes-AMG E 43 joined the range in September 2016, powered by a twin-turbo 3.0-litre V6, producing of torque, mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission. Acceleration from 0 to takes 4.6 seconds. Top speed is electronically limited to 250 km/h (155 mph).http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-new-york-motor- show/mercedes-amg-e43-4matic-revealed-new-york-motor-show The AMG E 43 was the first of the new AMG 43 series with a higher output of 401 PS vs 367 PS of the existing AMG 43 series. === AMG E 53 4MATIC+ (2018\u2013) === Mercedes-AMG E 53 4MATIC+ A mid-level AMG version, E 53 4MATIC+, is fitted with a 3-litre 6-cylinder inline M256 E30 DEH LA G engine, producing and . Due to the higher volume of mid-level AMG version, this type of engine is tuned by AMG and built on the assembly lines by people and robots at the manufacturing plants rather than \"one man, one engine\" approach. The Mercedes-AMG coup\u00e9 and cabriolet versions were introduced once again after skipping C207/A207 (2010\u20132017). AMG E 53 4MATIC+ remains the sole AMG version for both coup\u00e9 and cabriolet. ===AMG E 63 4MATIC+ and AMG E 63 S 4MATIC+ Saloon/Sedan (2016\u2013)=== Presented in November 2016, the new Mercedes-AMG AMG E 63 4MATIC+ and AMG E 63 S 4MATIC+ received AMG M177 twin-turbo 4.0-litre V8 in two states of tune and with fully variable all-wheel-drive. The standard AMG E 63 4MATIC+ has 420 kW (563 hp) and accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.5 seconds. The AMG E 63 S 4MATIC+ has same engine but with higher output rate at 450Kw/612 HP and accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.4 seconds. Both versions are electronically limited to 250 km/h (155 mph), however this can be increased to with the AMG Driver's Package.http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-la-motor- show/2017-mercedes-amg-e-63-arrives-la-quickest-amg-yet === AMG E 63 4MATIC+ and AMG E 63 S 4MATIC+ Estate/Wagon (2016\u2013) === Just like the AMG sedan versions, the E 63 wagon is also equipped with 4MATIC+ fully variable AWD and is also equipped with the 4.0 litre V8 in two states of tune. The AMG E 63 wagon's styling cues and features are much different from the base model to distinguish that it is a performance variant of the car. The front bumper is wider, a front splitter is added, and large opening flanks are seen on the AMG-branded grille. The car also has various AMG branding throughout the it to show its significance and the badging on the rear trunk lid depicts that it is in fact an AMG E 63 (S) wagon. The AMG E 63 wagon is equipped with 64 cubic feet of cargo volume compared to the AMG E 63 sedan's 57.4 cubic feet. The vehicle is also used as the official F1 medical car. ==Facelift== Estate facelift. For the 2021 model year, the E-Class has received updated front and rear fascias along with a new mild-hybrid 6-cylinder inline engine for the E450 model; the E350e and All-Terrain will now be available in the United States as well. Inside, COMAND is replaced by MBUX with a 12.3-inch touchscreen and revised touch-sensitive controls. Driver-assistance technology has also been updated featuring an advanced capacitive hands-off detection system. Mercedes-AMG announced on 27 May 2020 that the updated Mercedes-AMG versions of coup\u00e9 and cabriolet are now available.
