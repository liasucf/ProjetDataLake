    "text": "Mon Ch\u00e9ri is an internationally known brand name of the Italian Ferrero company for a chocolate confectionery. The phrase \"mon ch\u00e9ri\" is French for \"my darling\". The Mon Ch\u00e9ri is a single-wrapped combination consisting of a \"heart\" of cherry (18%) floating in a liqueur (13%) and contained in a bittersweet chocolate housing (69%). Each praline contains 46 kilocalories and is packaged in a red/pink wrapper. Ferrero website Mon Ch\u00e9ri appeared for the first time in Italy in 1956. From 1960 it was produced and marketed on the French and UK markets, and from 1961 on the German market. The name was chosen as a reference to the French way of life and was quickly adopted as brand name for the international market. For the American market Mon Ch\u00e9ri was actually filled with hazelnuts and did not contain liqueur, similar to the Ferrero K\u00fcsschen that are sold in Germany and Denmark. After more than 20 years this variety was discontinued, except in Puerto Rico where it is imported from Germany as \"Mon Cheri.\" Most other markets still sell the cherry-filled Mon Ch\u00e9ri. ==See also== * List of confectionery brands ==References== ==External links== *Ferrero Mon Ch\u00e9ri official website Category:Ferrero SpA brands Category:Chocolate ",
