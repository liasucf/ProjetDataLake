    "text": "Palingeniidae is a family of mayflies, members of which are known as spiny- headed burrowing mayflies. These are generally quite large mayflies with more than four longitudinal cross-veins on their wings. Males have short, wide pronotums and the legs are well-developed in both sexes. The cerci (tails) on females are shorter than the body. The nymphs live burrowed in the mud at the bottom of large streams and rivers. ==References== Category:Mayflies Category:Insect families ",
