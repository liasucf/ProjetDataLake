    "text": "Emily Taylor (born 28 June 1987 in Lincoln) is a former British rower. She was part of the British crew that won the silver medal in the Women's Eight at the 2008 European Rowing Championships, having won Bronze in the Women's Coxless Four at the World Rowing U23 Championships the previous year. Taylor also competed in the 2011 European Rowing Championships. She was the spare for the British Women's Eight crew at the 2008 Summer Olympics and would later criticise rowing coach Paul Thompson for creating a 'culture of fear' within the training squad. The accusation prompted British Rowing to launch an internal review. Taylor learned to row at Durham University. ==References== ==External Links== * Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:English female rowers Category:Durham University Boat Club rowers Category:Alumni of Hatfield College, Durham Category:European Rowing Championships medalists ",
