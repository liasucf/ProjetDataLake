Cooley, The Cambridge Manual of Latin Epigraphy (Cambridge: University Press, 2012), p. 459 Bartolomeo Borghesi has argued that Gaius Petronius is the same person as Gaius Petronius Umbrinus, who is mentioned in an inscription from Rome as curator locorum publicorum iudicandorum;; Borghesi, \u0152uvres compl\u00e8tes de Bartolomeo Borghesi (1860), III p. 343 this is unlikely since all known Petronii in the first half of the first century belong to the branch of the Petronii lacking a cognomen. Petronius was grandson of Publius Petronius Turpilianus, one of the tresviri monetalis, and probably grandson of Publius Petronius, prefect of Egypt. Publius Petronius, suffect consul in 19, was probably his older brother.Rudolf Hanslik, \"Petronius 22\", Realencyclop\u00e4die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft (Stuttgart, 1937) Vol. 19,1, Col. 1199 == References == Category:1st-century Romans Category:Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Category:Petronii ",
