    "text": "David Mathieson (born 18 January 1978 in Dumfries, Scotland) is a retired Scottish professional association footballer. A goalkeeper, he played for Queen of the South and Gretna and made three appearances for Scotland under-21s. ==Queen of the South== David Mathieson joined a Queen of the South in 1996 with new chairman Norman Blount getting the wheels moving on the club's revival. In 1997 Queen of the South reached the Scottish Challenge Cup final for the first time. Second Division Queens lost 1-0 to 1st Division Falkirk despite a rousing Queens display at Motherwell's Fir Park; a performance that included the man of the match award going to Queens veteran central midfield playmaker Tommy Bryce and an early career appearance for Jamie McAllister. A late chance for a Derek Townsley equaliser went agonisingly over for Queens. David Mathieson played in goals for Queens. At the end of season 1998-99 David Mathieson was the Queen of the South fan club player of the year. While at Queen of the South David Mathieson gained 3 Scotland under 21 caps. The opponents were Latvia, Colombia and Germany. Mathieson left Palmerston Park in 2001 after five seasons. ==Gretna== After leaving Palmerston Park he rejoined the former Queens player and manager, Rowan Alexander who was now the manager of non-league club Gretna. Gretna however successfully applied for admission to the Scottish League in 2002. The club were soon taken over by millionaire Brooks Mileson. Bank-rolled by Mileson, Gretna embarked upon an ambitious recruitment strategy. With high calibre players for the division on board, Mathieson picked up the 2005 Scottish Third Division championship. Mathieson then found himself out of favour when the club signed former St Johnstone goalkeeper Alan Main. Mathieson only had four appearances in season 2005-06 and his final appearance was in the Scottish Challenge Cup, early in season 2006-07. ==Honours== * Queen of the South \u2014 1997 Scottish Challenge Cup Finalist * Gretna \u2014 2004\u201305 Scottish Third Division winner ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Living people Category:1978 births Category:Scottish footballers Category:St Johnstone F.C. players Category:Queen of the South F.C. players Category:Gretna F.C. players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Scotland under-21 international footballers Category:Sportspeople from Dumfries Category:St Cuthbert Wanderers F.C. players Category:Rangers F.C. players ",
