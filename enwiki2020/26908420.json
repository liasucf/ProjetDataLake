    "text": "Phi Delta Kappa (\u03a6\u0394\u039a) was an American collegiate fraternity. ==History== It was founded in 1874 at Washington & Jefferson College in Washington, Pennsylvania when a chapter of Iota Alpha Kappa resolved to continue after Iota Alpha Kappa's dissolution. Chapters were founded at Western University in 1876, Thiel College in 1876, Lafayette College in 1876, and the University of Louisiana in 1878. By 1880, all of the chapters except for Washington & Jefferson College had become extinct. That chapter sought to survive by joining another fraternity. In 1881, the Washington & Jefferson College chapter joined Phi Gamma Delta, taking the designation of Alpha chapter, a designation that had belonged to the founding chapter of Phi Gamma Delta at Jefferson College. ==References== Category:Student organizations established in 1874 Category:1881 disestablishments in the United States Category:Student societies in the United States Category:Defunct fraternities and sororities Category:1874 establishments in Pennsylvania ",
