    "text": "\"You Won't Find Another Fool Like Me\" is a 1973 single by British pop group The New Seekers. Written by Tony Macaulay and Geoff Stephens, arranged by Gerry Shury and produced by Tommy Oliver. Featuring lead vocals by member Lyn Paul (the first time she had sung lead on a single), the song became the group's biggest hit for two years as it remained in the top five over Christmas 1973. \"You Won't Find Another Fool Like Me\" went on to be the band's second and final number-one single in the UK Singles Chart, spending a single week at the top of the chart in January 1974. The song was included on the group's final album as an active band, Together, as they announced their decision to split a month later. ==References== Category:1973 singles Category:UK Singles Chart number-one singles Category:Irish Singles Chart number-one singles Category:Songs written by Tony Macaulay Category:Songs written by Geoff Stephens Category:1973 songs Category:Polydor Records singles Category:The New Seekers songs ",
