The station is owned by John Garabedian, through licensee CodComm, Inc., with studios located on South Street in Hyannis and its transmitter is located in West Barnstable. ==History== WPXC's logo from 2003 until 2012 In February 2005, Ernie Boch, Sr. sold WPXC, WTWV, WDVT, WCOD, and WXTK to Qantum Communications. Due to the FCC's rules on ownership caps, Qantum had to put WTWV, WDVT, and WPXC up for a pending sale. In March 2005, Nassau Broadcasting Partners bought the three stations from Qantum Communications. WPXC's sister stations WTWV and WDVT became WFRQ and WFQR. Over the past seven years, WPXC has played more Classic Rock music than Active Rock while being owned by Nassau. On May 4, 2012, Nassau Broadcasting and its lenders auctioned off all of their Cape stations to John Garabedian. John Garabedian has made no change WPXC's format or staff, but CodComm has designed new logos and websites for Pixy 103 and Frank FM. On May 1, 2014, WPXC started transmitting an HD Radio digital signal.https://licensing.fcc.gov/cdbs/cdbs_docs/ef/Form335/335_101.cfm?form=335_101.cfm&acct;=0&appn;=101635239&fac;_num=54620&formid;=335 WPXC started simulcasting WFRQ on the HD2, and WKFY on the HD3 to feed the translators on 94.7 (W230AW) and 100.5/103.5 (W263CU)/(W278DW) respectively.https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn;=101630968&formid;=349&fac;_num=140929https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn;=101628286&formid;=349&fac;_num=140925 ==References== ==External links== * * CodComm Website PXC Category:Mainstream rock radio stations in the United States Category:Barnstable, Massachusetts PXC Category:Radio stations established in 1987 Category:1987 establishments in Massachusetts ",
