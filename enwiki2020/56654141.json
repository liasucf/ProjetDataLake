    "text": "Denarius of Gaius Renius, 138 BC. The obverse features a head of Roma, while the reverse depicts Juno Caprotina in a biga driven by two goats. The gens Rennia, occasionally written Renia, was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. No members of this gens obtained any of the higher offices of the Roman state, but the family is known from inscriptions, and coins issued by a certain Gaius Renius, depicting the head of Roma on the obverse, and on the reverse Juno Caprotina in a chariot pulled by two goats.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 645 (\"Renia Gens\").Eckhel, vol. v, pp. 291, 292.PW, s. v. Renius.Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage, pp. 264, 265. ==Origin== The appearance of Juno Caprotina suggests that the Rennii may have originated at Lanuvium, where Juno was particularly revered. The etymology of the nomen Rennius is uncertain; Chase suggests a possible connection with the Latin renes, kidneys.Chase, p. 131. ==Praenomina== Like other families known chiefly from imperial times, the Rennii seem to have confined themselves to the most common praenomina, and particularly Lucius, Gaius, and Marcus. The only other names found among the Rennii are Publius, Quintus, and Decimus, of which only the last was relatively uncommon. ==Branches and cognomina== The Rennii do not appear to have been divided into distinct families, and all of their surnames appear to have been personal cognomina, many of them probably having been the original names of freedmen of the gens. Of those that were more typical of Roman surnames, Aestivus refers to the summer, and was probably given to someone born during that season. Candidus means gleaming white, and could refer to one's hair or clothing. Crispinus, a diminutive of Crispus, referred to someone with curly hair.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. aestivus, candidus, crispus.Chase, p. 110. Faustus, fortunate, and Proculus were old praenomina, which came to be used as surnames in the later Republic and imperial times. Felix, happy, and Firmus, strong, Hilarus, cheerful, Rufus, red, and Venustus, charming or handsome, were all common names; Laetus, glad, and Orientis, eastern, were more distinctive. A number of other surnames borne by both the men and women of the Rennii were also old praenomina, or similar individualizing cognomina, including Maxima, eldest, Prima, first, Secundus, second, and Tertius, third.Chase, pp. 110, 111, 145, 150, 165, 167, 171, 172.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. faustus, felix, firmus, hilarus, rufus, venustus, laetus, oriens. ==Members== * Rennia \u0186. l., a freedwoman, and the wife of Lygidus, buried at Opitergium in Venetia and Histria, in a tomb built by Marcus Fulvius Marcellinus.. * Rennius, a centurion in the first cohort of the praetorian guard.. * Gaius Renius, triumvir monetalis in 138 BC.
