TNT typically makes up 25% to 33% of the mixture. Because of the high density of barium nitrate, Baratol has a density of at least 2.5 g/cm3. Baratol, which has a detonation velocity of only about 4,900 metres per second,High explosive compound - Patent 3956039 was used as the slow- detonating explosive in the explosive lenses of some early atomic bombs, with Composition B often used as the fast-detonating component. Atomic bombs detonated at Trinity in 1945, the Soviet Joe 1 in 1949, and in India in 1972 all used Baratol and Composition B.
