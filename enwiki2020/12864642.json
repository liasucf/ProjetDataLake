    "text": "Norfenfluramine, or 3-trifluoromethylamphetamine, is a never-marketed drug of the amphetamine family that behaves as a serotonin and norepinephrine releasing agent and potent 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C agonist. The action of norfenfluramine on 5-HT2B receptors on heart valves leads to a characteristic pattern of heart failure following proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts on the tricuspid valve, known as cardiac fibrosis. This side effect led to the withdrawal of fenfluramine as an anorectic agent worldwide, and to the withdrawal of benfluorex in Europe, as both fenfluramine and benfluorex form norfenfluramine as an active metabolite. It is a human TAAR1 agonist. ==See also== * Fenfluramine * Benfluorex * Norfenfluramine is the precursor to flucetorex ==References== Category:5-HT2B agonists Category:Substituted amphetamines Category:Anorectics Category:Trifluoromethyl compounds Category:Serotonin receptor agonists Category:Serotonin-norepinephrine releasing agents Category:TAAR1 agonists Category:Human drug metabolites ",
