He was killed by friendly fire before the start of World War II. ==Biography== Josifovi\u0107 was born in the village of Makedonski Brod in Pore\u010d. He joined the Serbian Chetnik Organization in 1905 under the command of Rade Radivojevi\u0107-Du\u0161an. After the death of his commander in 1907, Mihailo Josifovi\u0107 served as voivode in 1908 until the Young Turk Revolution. From 1911 he was acting as the commander in Pore\u010d with a nominal salary of three Turkish liras per month. When the Second Balkan War broke out in 1913, he defended Ki\u010devo along with Vasilije Trbi\u0107, Bo\u0161ko Virjanac, Jovan Dolga\u010d, and Dane Stojanovi\u0107. After the war, he acquired 10 hectares of land in Makedonski Brod where he settled down to raise a family. ==Death== Vojvode Mikajle was killed at the beginning of World War II in an altercation with a sentry. He was killed by a guard, who asked Mikajle to lay down his weapon, unaware that he was a voivode (Duke). At the soldier's request to disarm, Mikajle kept defiantly approaching him with the question, \"Do you know who I am?\" A shot followed, killing him instantly. == References == Category:1870 births Category:1941 deaths Category:People from Pore\u010d Category:People from Kosovo Vilayet Category:Serbian military personnel of the Balkan Wars Category:Serbian people of World War I Category:19th-century Serbian people Category:20th-century Serbian people ",
