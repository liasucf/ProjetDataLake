In an interview with The Masters Review, Link explains that when writing she often thinks about the conventions of storytelling, which allows her to mix so many different genres within her stories. For her writing, there is no \"real\" or unreal\" elements when developing stories. Link has also stated that her stories are not written to fit specific themes and that many of her stories were written for different editors for previous publications. For this book, there was no specific time frame for her to complete her stories, and states that \"The New Boyfriend\" and \"The Summer People\" both took about a week to write, whereas \"I Can See Right Through You\" took longer than a year. == Reception == The collections received generally positive reviews. From The New York Times, author Scarlett Thomas wrote that \"Link's stories are never fully realist, but they are always beautifully written\" and commends her ability to get readers to reflect and focus on \"the small stuff of life.\" A critic from Kirkus Reviews compared it to the Grimm Brothers and stated, \"Exquisite, cruelly wise and the opposite of reassuring, these stories linger like dreams...\" Publisher's Weekly wrote \"Link's characters, driven by yearning and obsession, not only get in trouble but seek trouble out\u2014to spectacular effect.\" === Accolades === The book was a finalist for two awards in 2016: the Pulitzer Prize in Fiction and the Indies Choice Book Award in the \"Book of the Year - Adult Fiction\" category. The story \"The Summer People\" won the 2011 Shirley Jackson Awards for best novelette. == References == Category:2016 short story collections ",
