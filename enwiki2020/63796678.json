    "text": "The R11 is a line of Rodalies de Catalunya's regional rail service, operated by Renfe Operadora. It runs northwards from the Barcelona area to the French border town of Cerb\u00e8re, passing through the Vall\u00e8s Oriental, Selva, Giron\u00e8s and Alt Empord\u00e0 regions. With a total line length of , it extends notably beyond the limits of the Barcelona metropolitan area, reaching the Pyrenees mountains. R11 trains run primarily on the Barcelona\u2013Cerb\u00e8re railway, using and/or Cerb\u00e8re as their northeasternmost terminus, and as its southwestern one. They use the Arag\u00f3 Tunnel in Barcelona, where they share tracks with Rodalies de Catalunya's Barcelona suburban lines , and and regional rail lines , , and , calling at Sants and Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia stations, while they continue to share tracks with Barcelona commuter rail service as far as , and with the Girona commuter rail service from Ma\u00e7anet-Massanes to . The Ma\u00e7anet-Massanes- Portbou section had not previously been considered part of the Barcelona commuter rail service; designated Ca2, the services running on it were part of Renfe Operadora's regional rail division in Catalonia. In 2010, after the administration of the Barcelona commuter rail service was transferred to the Catalan government, the line was passed from the Catalan regional rail division to Rodalies de Catalunya. ==History== The current line scheme of the R11 started operating on , after the transfer of the services from Media Distancia Renfe to the Generalitat of Catalonia. Earlier, all the regional rail services carryoing out the line Barcelona-Girona-Figueres-Portbou were branded as Ca2 for the Catalan rail division, and 33 in the nationwide regional rail network. Before 2014, it was the only conventional line to serve the cities of Girona and Figueres (excluding the high-speed lines), until the creation of the Girona commuter rail service , running from Barcelona to Figueres initially, being later extended to Portbou. ==Infrastructure== Like the rest of Rodalies de Catalunya lines, the R11 runs on the Iberian gauge mainline railway system, which is owned by Adif, an agency of the Spanish government. All of the railway lines carrying Rodalies de Catalunya services are electrified at 3,000 volts (V) direct current (DC) using overhead lines. The R11 operates on a total line length of , entirely double-track. The trains on the line call at up to 28 stations, using the following railway lines, in order from south to north: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! From !! To !! Railway line !!

Between and Barcelona Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia stations, it shares tracks with Rodalies de Catalunya's Barcelona commuter rail service lines , and , regional rail lines , , and , as well as a number of long- distance services to southern Spain, using the Arag\u00f3 Tunnel through central Barcelona. After Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, R11 trains R2 Sud trains, together with the R13, R14, R15 and R16, as well as long-distance services, branch off to Barcelona's Estaci\u00f3 de Fran\u00e7a, terminating there. R11 services continue northwards through the Arag\u00f3 Tunnel, calling at El Clot-Arag\u00f3 railway station, and share tracks with the R2 and R2 Nord only. North of Mollet-Sant Fost railway station, Barcelona commuter rail service line and several freight services join their route. The R8 terminates further north at so that the R11 only shares tracks with the R2 and freight services from this point on up to Ma\u00e7anet-Massanes. From Ma\u00e7anet-Massanes, R11 trains share tracks with the Girona commuter rail service RG1 and freight trains for the remainder of their journey. ==Operation== All services that initiate from as their southern terminus terminate at either , or continue all the way to and Cerb\u00e8re. All services terminating at Cerb\u00e8re call at all stations. Trains termating at Girona, Figueres or Portbou, run either calling at all stations, or stopping at only some stations. The first trains run about 6:00 in the morning, with the latest arriving at about 11:00 at night. The designation of the services on the line depends on the route they operate. Services calling at all stations are branded as R (Regional), operated by RENFE Class 447 trains, while semi-fast services are branded as MD (Media Distancia/Mitjana Distancia), operated by RENFE Class 449 trains, Renfe Operadora's newest rolling stock for regional lines, and are more expensive than R trains.. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
