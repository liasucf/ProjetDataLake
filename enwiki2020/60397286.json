    "text": "The Eastern Africa Power Pool (EAPP), is a collaborative effort by eleven countries in Eastern Africa to interconnect their electricity grids and take advantage of excess capacity within the network and facilitate trade of electric power between the members. ==Location== The secretariat of the Eastern Africa Power Pool organisation is located at Wereda 02, House 059, Bole Sub City, in Addis Ababa, the capital and largest city of Ethiopia. ==History== In February 2005, seven countries in the Eastern African region came together because they saw mutual benefit in having one power pool. The original countries were, Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, and Sudan. Later, Tanzania (2010), Libya (2011), Djibouti and Uganda (2012) joined the pool. The objectives of the Eastern Africa Power Pool include (a) the reduction of power costs within the region (b) facilitation of power trade between the members (c) increasing energy availability to citizens of member countries (d) increase the grid security of the member countries. As a prerequisite to the success of these efforts, power grid interconnections between the member countries need to be established. Such interconnections include the interconnection between Ethiopia and Kenya via the Sodo\u2013Moyale\u2013Suswa High Voltage Power Line Other such linkages are the Bujagali\u2013Tororo\u2013Lessos High Voltage Power Line, between Uganda and Kenya, the Isinya\u2013Singida High Voltage Power Line, between Kenya and Tanzania, the Kawanda\u2013Birembo High Voltage Power Line, between Uganda and Rwanda, the Nkenda\u2013Mpondwe\u2013Beni High Voltage Power Line, between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. and the Karuma\u2013Juba High Voltage Power Line between Uganda and South Sudan. ==Pool capacity== Te table below, outlines the installed capacity, peak demand and the excess capacity or deficit for each of the eleven countries in the Eastern Africa Power Pool, as of June 2019. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin: 0.5em auto\" |+ Members and capacities of countries in the Eastern Africa Power Pool !
