    "text": "The Tune is a 1992 animated musical-comedy film directed by Bill Plympton. ==Plot summary== Del, a hard-working songwriter, is trying to write the perfect song for his slimeball boss, Mr. Mega, so he can keep his job and his girlfriend Didi. As he rushes to work, he gets lost in a cloverleaf highway and ends up lost in a town called Flooby Nooby, where he meets the town's singing and swingin' mayor, an Elvis-impersonating dog, a noseless cab driver, and a psychotic bellhop as he tries to get to Mr. Mega's office to deliver the song. ==Production== The Tune, was Bill Plympton's first feature-length film and incorporates earlier shorts released by Plympton, including The Wiseman (1991), Dig My Do (1990), and Tango Schmango (1990). It was self-funded and took two years to make. Its music was composed by Maureen McElheron, a longtime friend of Plympton's who has composed the music for most of his films. ==Reception== The Tune premiered April 25, 1992 at the Sundance Film Festival. It was also shown at the Cannes Film Festival before being released in the United States on September 4, 1992. At least one critic observed that the incorporated shorts seemed out-of-place with the film's original material.http://tech.mit.edu/V112/N48/tune.48a.html The Tune was nominated for a number of awards in 1992 and 1993. The film was preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2016. ==See also== *The Point! *List of animated feature films ==References== ==External links== * Category:1992 films Category:American films Category:American musical comedy films Category:Films directed by Bill Plympton Category:Animated feature films Category:1990s American animated films Category:1990s musical comedy films Category:1992 comedy films ",
