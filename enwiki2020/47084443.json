    "text": "Dengir Mir Mehmet F\u0131rat (8 August 1943 \u2013 11 July 2019) was a Kurdish politician who was one of the founders of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in 2001. He served as a Member of Parliament for the Grand National Assembly from 1999 to 2011 and again from 2015 to 2018 as a member of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP). ==Early life== F\u0131rat was born in the district of Kahta in Adyaman on 8 August 1943. His grandfather, Hac\u0131 Bedir F\u0131rat, was an MP during the first, second and third Parliaments of the Turkish Republic, serving from Malatya for the first and second and from Kars for the third Parliament. His uncle H\u00fcseyin Fehmi F\u0131rat was a Democratic Party politician who also served as an MP for three terms. His cousin, Mehmet S\u0131rr\u0131 Turanl\u0131, was an MP for Ad\u0131yaman in the 11th Parliament and was later also a senator. In Kurdish, the name 'Dengir' means \"great voice\" while the name 'M\u00eer' means bey (local leader). Mir Mehmet was the name of one of F\u0131rat's forefathers. From a Kurdish background, F\u0131rat's grandfather was given a medal by Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk.http://www.radikal.com.tr/haber.php?haberno=223380&tarih;=06/06/2007 After graduation, F\u0131rat served as a freelance lawyer, a farmer and an export tradesman. He was a member of the Executive Board of the Mediterranean Exporters Association. ==Political career== ===Felicity Party, 1999-2001=== F\u0131rat was elected as a Member of Parliament for Adyaman from the Islamist orientated Virtue Party (FP) in the 1999 general election. The party saw a split between traditionalist Islamists and moderate conservatives over the course of the Parliament, with a party leadership election contested by the most modern Abdullah G\u00fcl and traditionalist incumbent Recai Kutan yielding a victory for Kutan. In the 2000 presidential election, F\u0131rat put his name forward as a candidate, but withdrew and was defeated by cross-party candidate Ahmet Necdet Sezer. The party was closed down in 2001 by the Constitutional Court for violating state secularism, after which traditionalist MPs formed the Felicity Party (SP) while moderate conservatives formed the Justice and Development Party (AKP). F\u0131rat was one of the founding members of the AKP and joined the party after the FP's dissolution. ===Justice and Development Party, 2001-14=== As one of the founders of the AKP, F\u0131rat served as a Deputy leader of the party under Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. He was elected in the 2002 general election as a Member of Parliament for Mersin and re-elected in the 2007 general election as a Member of Parliament for Adana. He did not contest the 2011 general election. Despite the AKP forming a majority government in both 2002 and 2007, F\u0131rat was not made a Minister despite being one of the AKP's founders. In an interview given to the New York Times in 2008, F\u0131rat caused controversy after criticising Atat\u00fcrk for his secular revolutions for causing a 'trauma' within society. Serving as the party's deputy leader, F\u0131rat resigned from this role in November 2008 after accusations of corruption during a live debate with Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, the parliamentary group leader of the Republican People's Party. He resigned from the AKP completely on 27 July 2014, positing his decision on Facebook. ===Peoples' Democratic Party, 2015-2019=== F\u0131rat defected from the AKP to the HDP in February 2015, with the intention of running for Parliament from Mersin as a HDP candidate. He claimed that the HDP could become the main opposition party in future elections. His defection was one of the high-profile defections that the AKP had suffered to the HDP, which was perceived to be taking large portions of the AKP vote in the Kurdish south-east of Turkey. He was elected to Parliament in the June 2015 general election after his party succeeded in surpassing the 10% election threshold needed to gain seats in Parliament. He was subsequently put forward by the HDP as their candidate for Parliamentary Speaker in the June\u2013July 2015 speaker elections, but was eliminated in the third round. He died on 11 July 2019, aged 75, from lung cancer. ==See also== *Selahattin Demirta\u015f *Figen Y\u00fcksekda\u011f *Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan ==References== ==External links== *Collection of all relevant news items at Radikal.com *Collection of all relevant news items at Haberler.com *Collection of all relevant news items at H\u00fcrriyet *Collection of all relevant news items at Sondakika.com *Collection of all relevant news items at Milliyet Category:1943 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Turkish Kurdish people Category:Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey) politicians Category:Justice and Development Party (Turkey) politicians Category:People from Ad\u0131yaman Category:Deaths from cancer in Turkey Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:Deputies of Mersin Category:Members of the 25th Parliament of Turkey Category:Members of the 23rd Parliament of Turkey Category:Members of the 22nd Parliament of Turkey Category:Members of the 21st Parliament of Turkey Category:Members of the 26th Parliament of Turkey Category:Ankara University alumni ",
