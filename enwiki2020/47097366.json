    "text": "The sport of ski jumping has seen the use of numerous different techniques, or \"styles\", over the course of its more than two-hundred-year history. Depending on how the skis are positioned by an athlete, distances have increased by as much as within the past century. ==Kongsberger== Harald Pfeffer using the Kongsberger technique, 1959 The Kongsberger technique (Norwegian: Kongsbergknekk) was created by Jacob Tullin Thams and Sigmund Ruud in Kongsberg, Norway. Developed after World War I, the technique was characterised by the athlete's upper body being bent at the hip, with arms extended at the front in the manner of a \"superhero\",Mooallem, Jon (6 March 2018). \"Once Prohibited, Women's Ski Jumping Is Set to Take Flight\". The New York Times. The New York Times Company. Retrieved 3 April 2018. and skis held parallel to each other. Sometimes the arms would be waved or 'flapped' around vigorously in a bird-like manner. This technique extended jumping lengths from to over , and was used in ski jumping until being superseded by the Windisch and D\u00e4scher techniques in the 1950s.MacArthur, Paul J.

Retrieved 22 May 2015. ==Windisch== Miro Oman using the Windisch technique, 1958 The Windisch technique, created by Erich Windisch in 1949, was a modification of the Kongsberger technique. The athlete's arms are instead placed backwards toward the hips for a closer, more aerodynamic lean. ==Parallel/classic/D\u00e4scher== Hans-Georg Aschenbach using the parallel style, 1973 The parallel style,Ito, Shinichiro; Seo, Kazuya; Asai, Takeshi (2008). \"An Experimental Study on Ski Jumping Styles (P140)\".

Retrieved 11 February 2020.] or D\u00e4scher technique was created by Andreas D\u00e4scher in the 1950s, as a modification of the Kongsberger and Windisch techniques. No longer was the upper body bent as much at the hip, enabling a flatter, more aerodynamic position in the air. This style became the standard for ski jumping as a whole until the development of the V-style. In the 1980s, Matti Nyk\u00e4nen created a variation of the parallel style in which the skis were pointed diagonally off to the side in order to increase surface area, essentially forming a crude \"half 'V'\".Higdon, Hal (March\u2013April 1991). Snow Country, pp. 48\u201351, at Google Books. Retrieved 23 May 2015. ==V-style== Primo\u017e Peterka using the V-style, 1997 The V-style, sometimes called the Graf\u2013Bokl\u00f6v technique,Maryniak, Jerzy; \u0141ady\u017cy\u0144ska-Kozdra\u015b, Edyta; Tomczak, Sfawomir (2009-12-14).

It became the predominant jumping technique following the D\u00e4scher/parallel style, which was last used in the early 1990s. The originator of the V-style was Miros\u0142aw Graf, a Polish ski jumper from Szklarska Por\u0119ba.Johnson, Wayne (2007). White Heat: The Extreme Skiing Life. Graf discovered the technique as a child in 1969, but it was not taken seriously by his contemporaries. He was nonetheless aware that the V-style was highly effective, as his jumps became considerably longer. In the early 1980s, Steve Collins used a modified variation of the V-style, or \"delta style\", with the ski tips held together in front instead of at the rear.\"USASJ Story Project- Dec 31 Bakke\". USA Ski Jumping Story Project. 31 December 2012. Archived from the original on 4 March 2016. Retrieved 5 February 2017. Collins was the youngest winner of a World Cup event at the age of fifteen, but his technique never caught on. During this era, any technique aside from the parallel style was considered inappropriate by FIS judges. Although it enabled much longer jumps \u2013 up to ten per cent more than the parallel style \u2013 judges made it an issue to award poor marks to those who used it. The V-style only became recognised as valid by judges in the early 1990s, following wins and high rankings by Jan Bokl\u00f6v and Ji\u0159\u00ed Malec, who insisted on using the technique despite receiving low style points. By the mid-1990s it had become the predominant style of jumping used by all athletes, and was therefore no longer penalised as it had proven to be both safer and more efficient than the parallel style. ==H-style== L\u00e9a Lemare using the H-style, 2017 In the H-style, the skis are spread very wide apart and held parallel in an \"H\" shape,German commentary following Lucile Morat's first-round jump, from the ORF broadcast in Sapporo on 12 January 2019. with minimal or no V-angle.Tiilikainen, Tomi (24 September 2010). \"V-tyylist\u00e4 kohti H-tyyli\u00e4 - \"Uran kovin muutosten kausi\"\" (in Finnish).
