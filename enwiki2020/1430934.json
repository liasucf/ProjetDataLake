    "text": "The Second Battle of Athenry ( ) took place at Athenry () in Ireland on 10 August 1316 during the Bruce campaign in Ireland. ==Overview== The collective number of both armies are unknown, and can only be estimated. Martyn believes the royal army to have been as much as or more than a thousand, while that of Athenry was probably several hundred less. The list of deceased participants on the Irish side alone indicates that exceptionally high numbers were involved.The Battle of Athenry, Adrian Martyn, in East Galway News and Views, August 2008 - May 2009. ==Outcome== Unlike the First Battle of Athenry in 1249, no account is given of the battle itself in any surviving account. Even the site of the battle itself is uncertain. Rickard de Bermingham and William Liath de Burgh led an Anglo-Irish force to victory. John Clyn states that \"According to common report a sum of five .... thousand in all [were killed] the number decapitated was one thousand five hundred.\"The Annals of Ireland by Friar John Clyn, p. 164, edited by Bernadette Williams, 2007. The battle was a devastating defeat for the Connacht Gaels, who were allied with the Scotsman Edward Bruce. Among those killed were kings Fedlim \u00d3 Conchobair and Tadhg \u00d3 Cellaigh King of U\u00ed Maine.A Dictionary of British History. 2001, 2004 by Oxford University Press. Retrieved 12 Mar. 2008.
