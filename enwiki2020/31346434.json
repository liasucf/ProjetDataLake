    "text": "The Littlest Groom is a reality television miniseries that aired for two episodes on the Fox network in 2004. Modelled on The Bachelor, the miniseries followed salesman Glen Foster, a 4'5\" dwarf, in his search for love within a group of both dwarf women and women of average height. ==Reception== The show was subjected to considerable negative criticism from media critics and the general public, due to its purportedly exploitative \u201clatter-day freak show\u201d dimensionRobert McRuer. Crip Theory: Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability (New York University Press, 2006), p. 58. Note that, after outlining this conventional interpretation, McRuer foregrounds the ways in which we can \u201cread the show against the grain\u201d (60) to identify signs of resistance to it; see Crip Theory, pp. 58-63. or \u201ccarnival-like\u201d quality.Michelle Brophy-Baermann. \u201cTrue Love on TV: A Gendered Analysis of Reality-Romance Television\u201d. Poroi, 4.2 (2005): art. 2, para. 3 Nonetheless, at least one of the little women who appeared on the show explicitly rejected this interpretation, as did Foster himself. Similarly, Matt Roloff, then- president of the advocacy group Little People of America, commented on the potential for The Littlest Groom to provide a positive media representation of little people as individuals \u201cjust being themselves\". \u201c[H]iding us behind closed doors or in funny costumes\u201d, he observed, \u201cwill never give us the exposure needed to desensitize society to us\u201d.
