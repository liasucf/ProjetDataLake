    "text": "William Walond (b Oxford, bap. 16 July 1719; d Oxford, bur. 21 Aug 1768) was an English composer and organist. ==Career== After four years as Assistant Organist of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, Walond graduated from Christ Church, Oxford in 1757. His setting of Alexander Pope's Ode on St Cecilia's Day had served as his exercise. He also published two sets of voluntaries for the organ or harpsichord (op. 1, c. 1752 and op. 2, 1758) and the anthem Not unto us, O Lord. Of his fourteen children, his eldest son William Walond Jr. (c. 1750-1836) deserves to be mentioned. He became the last Organist of Chichester Cathedral before the post was merged with 'Master of the Choristers' in 1801. == External links == * == References == Category:British composers Category:British organists Category:British male organists Category:1719 births Category:1768 deaths Category:18th-century composers Category:18th-century male musicians Category:18th-century keyboardists ",
