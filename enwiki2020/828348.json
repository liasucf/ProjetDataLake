    "text": "Edvard Munch () is a 1974 biographical film about the Norwegian Expressionist painter Edvard Munch, written and directed by English filmmaker Peter Watkins. It was originally created as a three-part miniseries co-produced by the Norwegian and Swedish state television networks NRK and SVT, but subsequently gained an American theatrical release in a three-hour version in 1976. The film covers about thirty years of Munch's life, focusing on the influences that shaped his art, particularly the prevalence of disease and death in his family and his youthful affair with a married woman. The film was screened at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, but wasn't entered into the main competition. ==Style== Like Watkins' other films, Edvard Munch uses a docudrama approach; scenes from Munch's life are re-enacted by a large cast (mostly Norwegian non- professional actors), but there is also a voiceover narration by Watkins, and there are moments when the characters speak directly to camera, as if being interviewed about their own lives or their opinions of Munch. Some of the dialogue was improvised by the cast, especially in the interview segments. To convey the hostile response Munch's work often received during his lifetime, Watkins recruited Norwegians who genuinely disliked the paintings. ==Distribution and responses== After its initial broadcast, the film was briefly an international success but was not widely available for many years afterward. Watkins has said that network officials tried to suppress its distribution, and tried to bar it from competition in the Cannes Film Festival, because they disapproved of its use of non-professional actors and anachronistic dialogue. After NRK relinquished rights to the film in 2002, it gained a wider international release. Ingmar Bergman called the film a \"work of genius\". ==Cast== *Geir Westby as Edvard Munch *Gro Fraas as Fru Heiberg *Johan Halsbog as Dr. Christian Munch *Lotte Teig as Laura Cathrine Bj\u00f8lstad *Gro Jarto as Laura Cathrine Munch *Rachel Pedersen as Inger Marie Munch *Berit Rytter Hasle as Laura Munch *Gunnar Skjetne as Peter Andreas Munch *Kare Stormark as Hans J\u00e6ger *Eli Ryg as Oda Lasson *Iselin Bast as Dagny Juell *Alf K\u00e5re Strindberg as August Strindberg *Eric Allum as Edvard - 1868 *Amund Berge as Edvard - 1875 *Kerstii Allum as Sophie - 1869 *Inger-Berit Oland as Sophie - 1875 *Susan Troldmyr as Laura - 1868 *Camilla Falk as Laura - 1875 *Ragnvald Caspari as Peter - 1868 *Erik Kristiansen as Peter - 1875 *Katja Pedersen as Inger - 1868 *Anne-Marie D\u00e6hli as Inger - 1875 ==References== ==External links== *Notes on Edvard Munch on Peter Watkin's website * * *Stanford Museum document on screening of film Category:1974 films Category:1970s biographical drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Peter Watkins Category:French-language films Category:Norwegian films Category:Norwegian-language films Category:Swedish films Category:Biographical films about painters Category:Films set in the 1890s Category:Films set in Norway Category:Swedish biographical drama films Category:Norwegian biographical films Category:Cultural depictions of Edvard Munch Category:Cultural depictions of August Strindberg Category:1974 drama films ",
