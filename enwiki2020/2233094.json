As the eldest surviving grandson of Vsevolod III, he succeeded to Vladimir in 1272 and to Novgorod the following year. He was one of the first princes who didn't bother to leave their own town (i.e., Kostroma) and settle in Vladimir. His descendants continued to rule Kostroma for half a century after his death in January 1276. ==See also== * Rulers of Russia family tree Category:1241 births Category:1276 deaths Category:Grand Princes of Vladimir Category:Rurik dynasty Category:Yurievichi family Category:13th-century princes in Kievan Rus' Category:Eastern Orthodox monarchs ",
