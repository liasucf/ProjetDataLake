He is a Senator of the 2nd District of Antofagasta and was the 2017 Presidential candidate of the New Majority. Guillier ran in the New Majority primary for the 2017 election and was the coalition's standard bearer in the 2017 Presidential Elections to replace term-limited president Michelle Bachelet. Among others, he faced former PPD President Ricardo Lagos before the latter's withdrawal from the contest. Polling showed him to be competitive against Chile Vamos candidate Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, although his support slipped in the run up to the election and after a series of splits between the traditional left coalition block. Gullier is a freemason and a member of the Valpara\u00edso Parliamentary Lodge since 2014. ==References== ==External links== * Biography by CIDOB (in Spanish) Category:1953 births Category:Candidates for President of Chile Category:Chilean Freemasons Category:Chilean journalists Category:Chilean television presenters Category:Chilean people of French descent Category:Living people ",
