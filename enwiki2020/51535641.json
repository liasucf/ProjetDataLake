    "text": "Isaiah Nigel Johnson (born October 14, 1992) is an American football safety who is a free agent. He played college football at South Carolina and Kansas. ==College career== Initially Johnson attended Western Carolina but was granted a medical redshirt. In 2012 he played for Iowa Western Community College where he led the nation in interceptions and helped lead them to an NJCAA National Championship. Johnson then played at Kansas. In 2013 Johnson played safety at Kansas and finished second on the team in tackles with 73 total tackles, and also had 5 interceptions. Johnson was named Big 12 Defensive Newcomer of the Year. In 2014, Johnson was second on the team in tackles again with 75 total tackles, and also had 1 interception. Johnson graduated from Kansas with a degree in sociology and then transferred to South Carolina to play college football for his final season of eligibility. At South Carolina in 2015, Johnson was named one of the team captains. Johnson finished his final season of college football at South Carolina as the second leading tackler with 74 tackles and an interception. Overall, Johnson started all 36 of his career Division 1 college football games. ==Professional career== ===Tampa Bay Buccaneers=== Johnson was signed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an undrafted free agent on May 2, 2016. He was released on September 3, 2016 during final roster cuts and was signed to the practice squad. He spent the entire season on the practice squad and signed a reserve/future contract with the Buccaneers on January 2, 2017. On September 2, 2017, Johnson was waived by the Buccaneers and was signed to the practice squad the next day. He was promoted to the active roster on October 5, 2017. He was waived on October 24, 2017 and re- signed to the practice squad. He was promoted back to the active roster on December 20, 2017. On September 4, 2018, Isaiah Johnson makes the 53 man roster. On March 10, 2019, Tampa bay buccaneers extend tender to Johnson. The Buccaneers extended a tender to Johnson on Friday, Scott Smith of the team's official site reports. Johnson spent his first two years in the league unable to maintain a consistent role with a team, but he was on the active roster for all 16 games in 2018, recording 48 tackles and an interception. His contract tender basically guarantees he'll be with the Buccaneers in 2019, and he'll likely stick in a similar reserve role since Justin Evans and Jordan Whitehead are still under contract. On April 5, 2019, Johnson signed his exclusive rights tender prior to the start of offseason workouts Monday, Scott Smith of the Buccaneers' official site reports. The undrafted free agent played in 15 games during the 2018 season, logging four starts. Johnson acquitted himself well over that span, posting 48 tackles (40 solo), two passes defensed, one interception and one fumble recovery. In addition to serving as valuable depth in the secondary, Johnson also played extensively on special teams. Looking ahead to 2019, Johnson will look to reprise both roles under new coordinators Todd Bowles and Keith Armstrong, respectively. On August 31, 2019, Johnson was released by the Buccaneers. ===Winnipeg Blue Bombers=== Johnson signed with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers on February 28, 2020. After the CFL canceled the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson chose to opt-out of his contract with the Blue Bombers on August 27, 2020. ==References== ==External links== * South Carolina Gamecocks bio * Tampa Bay Buccaneers Tender * CBS SPORTS * Kansas Jayhawks Bio Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:American football safeties Category:Iowa Western Reivers football players Category:Kansas Jayhawks football players Category:People from Cary, North Carolina Category:Players of American football from North Carolina Category:South Carolina Gamecocks football players Category:Tampa Bay Buccaneers players Category:Western Carolina Catamounts football players Category:Winnipeg Blue Bombers players ",
