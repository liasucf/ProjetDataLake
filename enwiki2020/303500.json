    "text": ":Details, animated GIF version) In elementary algebra, completing the square is a technique for converting a quadratic polynomial of the form :ax^2 + bx + c to the form : a(x-h)^2 + k for some values of h and k. Completing the square is used in * solving quadratic equations, * deriving the quadratic formula, * graphing quadratic functions, * evaluating integrals in calculus, such as Gaussian integrals with a linear term in the exponent, * finding Laplace transforms. In mathematics, completing the square is often applied in any computation involving quadratic polynomials. ==Overview== ===Background=== The formula in elementary algebra for computing the square of a binomial is: :(x + p)^2 \\,=\\, x^2 + 2px + p^2. For example: :\\begin{alignat}{2} (x+3)^2 \\,&=\\, x^2 + 6x + 9 && (p=3)\\\\\\\\[3pt] (x-5)^2 \\,&=\\, x^2 - 10x + 25\\qquad && (p=-5). \\end{alignat} In any perfect square, the coefficient of x is twice the number p, and the constant term is equal to p2. ===Basic example=== Consider the following quadratic polynomial: :x^2 + 10x + 28. This quadratic is not a perfect square, since 28 is not the square of 5: :(x+5)^2 \\,=\\, x^2 + 10x + 25. However, it is possible to write the original quadratic as the sum of this square and a constant: :x^2 + 10x + 28 \\,=\\, (x+5)^2 + 3. This is called completing the square. ===General description=== Given any monic quadratic :x^2 + bx + c, it is possible to form a square that has the same first two terms: :\\left(x+\\tfrac{1}{2} b\\right)^2 \\,=\\, x^2 + bx + \\tfrac{1}{4}b^2. This square differs from the original quadratic only in the value of the constant term. Therefore, we can write :x^2 + bx + c \\,=\\, \\left(x + \\tfrac{1}{2}b\\right)^2 + k, where k \\,=\\, c - \\frac{b^2}{4}. This operation is known as completing the square. For example: :\\begin{alignat}{1} x^2 + 6x + 11 \\,&=\\, (x+3)^2 + 2 \\\\\\\\[3pt] x^2 + 14x + 30 \\,&=\\, (x+7)^2 - 19 \\\\\\\\[3pt] x^2 - 2x + 7 \\,&=\\, (x-1)^2 + 6. \\end{alignat} ===Non-monic case=== Given a quadratic polynomial of the form :ax^2 + bx + c it is possible to factor out the coefficient a, and then complete the square for the resulting monic polynomial. Example: : \\begin{align} 3x^2 + 12x + 27 &= 3(x^2+4x+9)\\\\\\ &{}= 3\\left((x+2)^2 + 5\\right)\\\\\\ &{}= 3(x+2)^2 + 15 \\end{align} This allows us to write any quadratic polynomial in the form :a(x-h)^2 + k. ===Formula=== ====Scalar case==== The result of completing the square may be written as a formula. For the general case:, Section Formula for the Vertex of a Quadratic Function, page 133\u2013134, figure 2.4.8 :ax^2 + bx + c \\;=\\; a(x-h)^2 + k,\\quad\\text{where}\\quad h = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad k = c - ah^2 = c - \\frac{b^2}{4a}. Specifically, when a = 1: :x^2 + bx + c \\;=\\; (x-h)^2 + k,\\quad\\text{where}\\quad h = -\\frac{b}{2} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad k = c - \\frac{b^2}{4}. ====Matrix case==== The matrix case looks very similar: :x^{\\mathrm{T}}Ax + x^{\\mathrm{T}}b + c = (x - h)^{\\mathrm{T}}A(x - h) + k \\quad\\text{where}\\quad h = -\\frac{1}{2}A^{-1}b \\quad\\text{and}\\quad k = c - \\frac{1}{4}b^{\\mathrm{T}}A^{-1}b where A has to be symmetric. If A is not symmetric the formulae for h and k have to be generalized to: :h = -(A+A^{\\mathrm{T}})^{-1}b \\quad\\text{and}\\quad k = c - h^{\\mathrm{T}}A h = c - b^{\\mathrm{T}} (A+A^{\\mathrm{T}})^{-1} A (A+A^{\\mathrm{T}})^{-1}b. ==Relation to the graph== In analytic geometry, the graph of any quadratic function is a parabola in the xy-plane. Given a quadratic polynomial of the form :(x-h)^2 + k \\quad\\text{or}\\quad a(x-h)^2 + k the numbers h and k may be interpreted as the Cartesian coordinates of the vertex (or stationary point) of the parabola. That is, h is the x-coordinate of the axis of symmetry (i.e. the axis of symmetry has equation x = h), and k is the minimum value (or maximum value, if a < 0) of the quadratic function. One way to see this is to note that the graph of the function \u0192(x) = x2 is a parabola whose vertex is at the origin (0, 0). Therefore, the graph of the function \u0192(x \u2212 h) = (x \u2212 h)2 is a parabola shifted to the right by h whose vertex is at (h, 0), as shown in the top figure. In contrast, the graph of the function \u0192(x) + k = x2 + k is a parabola shifted upward by k whose vertex is at (0, k), as shown in the center figure. Combining both horizontal and vertical shifts yields \u0192(x \u2212 h) + k = (x \u2212 h)2 + k is a parabola shifted to the right by h and upward by k whose vertex is at (h, k), as shown in the bottom figure. ==Solving quadratic equations== Completing the square may be used to solve any quadratic equation. For example: :x^2 + 6x + 5 = 0, The first step is to complete the square: :(x+3)^2 - 4 = 0. Next we solve for the squared term: :(x+3)^2 = 4. Then either :x+3 = -2 \\quad\\text{or}\\quad x+3 = 2, and therefore :x = -5 \\quad\\text{or}\\quad x = -1. This can be applied to any quadratic equation. When the x2 has a coefficient other than 1, the first step is to divide out the equation by this coefficient: for an example see the non-monic case below. ===Irrational and complex roots=== Unlike methods involving factoring the equation, which is reliable only if the roots are rational, completing the square will find the roots of a quadratic equation even when those roots are irrational or complex. For example, consider the equation :x^2 - 10x + 18 = 0. Completing the square gives :(x-5)^2 - 7 = 0, so :(x-5)^2 = 7. Then either :x-5 = -\\sqrt{7} \\quad\\text{or}\\quad x-5 = \\sqrt{7}, In terser language: :x-5 = \\pm \\sqrt{7}. so :x = 5 \\pm \\sqrt{7}. Equations with complex roots can be handled in the same way. For example: :\\begin{array}{c} x^2 + 4x + 5 \\,=\\, 0 \\\\\\\\[6pt] (x+2)^2 + 1 \\,=\\, 0 \\\\\\\\[6pt] (x+2)^2 \\,=\\, -1 \\\\\\\\[6pt] x+2 \\,=\\, \\pm i \\\\\\\\[6pt] x \\,=\\, -2 \\pm i. \\end{array} ===Non-monic case=== For an equation involving a non-monic quadratic, the first step to solving them is to divide through by the coefficient of x2. For example: :\\begin{array}{c} 2x^2 + 7x + 6 \\,=\\, 0 \\\\\\\\[6pt] x^2 + \\tfrac{7}{2}x + 3 \\,=\\, 0 \\\\\\\\[6pt] \\left(x+\\tfrac{7}{4}\\right)^2 - \\tfrac{1}{16} \\,=\\, 0 \\\\\\\\[6pt] \\left(x+\\tfrac{7}{4}\\right)^2 \\,=\\, \\tfrac{1}{16} \\\\\\\\[6pt] x+\\tfrac{7}{4} = \\tfrac{1}{4} \\quad\\text{or}\\quad x+\\tfrac{7}{4} = -\\tfrac{1}{4} \\\\\\\\[6pt] x = -\\tfrac{3}{2} \\quad\\text{or}\\quad x = -2. \\end{array} Applying this procedure to the general form of a quadratic equation leads to the quadratic formula. ==Other applications== ===Integration=== Completing the square may be used to evaluate any integral of the form :\\int\\frac{dx}{ax^2+bx+c} using the basic integrals :\\int\\frac{dx}{x^2 - a^2} = \\frac{1}{2a}\\ln\\left|\\frac{x-a}{x+a}\\right| +C \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\int\\frac{dx}{x^2 + a^2} = \\frac{1}{a}\\arctan\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right) +C. For example, consider the integral :\\int\\frac{dx}{x^2 + 6x + 13}. Completing the square in the denominator gives: :\\int\\frac{dx}{(x+3)^2 + 4} \\,=\\, \\int\\frac{dx}{(x+3)^2 + 2^2}. This can now be evaluated by using the substitution u = x + 3, which yields :\\int\\frac{dx}{(x+3)^2 + 4} \\,=\\, \\frac{1}{2}\\arctan\\left(\\frac{x+3}{2}\\right)+C. ===Complex numbers=== Consider the expression : |z|^2 - b^*z - bz^* + c, where z and b are complex numbers, z* and b* are the complex conjugates of z and b, respectively, and c is a real number. Using the identity |u|2 = uu* we can rewrite this as : |z-b|^2 - |b|^2 + c , which is clearly a real quantity. This is because : \\begin{align} |z-b|^2 &{}= (z-b)(z-b)^*\\\\\\ &{}= (z-b)(z^*-b^*)\\\\\\ &{}= zz^* - zb^* - bz^* + bb^*\\\\\\ &{}= |z|^2 - zb^* - bz^* + |b|^2 . \\end{align} As another example, the expression : ax^2 + by^2 + c , where a, b, c, x, and y are real numbers, with a > 0 and b > 0, may be expressed in terms of the square of the absolute value of a complex number. Define : z = \\sqrt{a}\\,x + i \\sqrt{b} \\,y . Then : \\begin{align} |z|^2 &{}= z z^*\\\\\\ &{}= (\\sqrt{a}\\,x + i \\sqrt{b}\\,y)(\\sqrt{a}\\,x - i \\sqrt{b}\\,y) \\\\\\ &{}= ax^2 - i\\sqrt{ab}\\,xy + i\\sqrt{ba}\\,yx - i^2by^2 \\\\\\ &{}= ax^2 + by^2 , \\end{align} so : ax^2 + by^2 + c = |z|^2 + c . ===Idempotent matrix=== A matrix M is idempotent when M 2 = M. Idempotent matrices generalize the idempotent properties of 0 and 1. The completion of the square method of addressing the equation :a^2 + b^2 = a , shows that some idempotent 2 \u00d7 2 matrices are parametrized by a circle in the (a,b)-plane: The matrix \\begin{pmatrix}a & b \\\\\\ b & 1-a \\end{pmatrix} will be idempotent provided a^2 + b^2 = a , which, upon completing the square, becomes :(a - \\tfrac{1}{2})^2 + b^2 = \\tfrac{1}{4} . In the (a,b)-plane, this is the equation of a circle with center (1/2, 0) and radius 1/2. ==Geometric perspective== 250px Consider completing the square for the equation :x^2 + bx = a. Since x2 represents the area of a square with side of length x, and bx represents the area of a rectangle with sides b and x, the process of completing the square can be viewed as visual manipulation of rectangles. Simple attempts to combine the x2 and the bx rectangles into a larger square result in a missing corner. The term (b/2)2 added to each side of the above equation is precisely the area of the missing corner, whence derives the terminology \"completing the square\". ==A variation on the technique== As conventionally taught, completing the square consists of adding the third term, v 2 to :u^2 + 2uv to get a square. There are also cases in which one can add the middle term, either 2uv or \u22122uv, to :u^2 + v^2 to get a square. ===Example: the sum of a positive number and its reciprocal=== By writing : \\begin{align} x + {1 \\over x} &{} = \\left(x - 2 + {1 \\over x}\\right) + 2\\\\\\ &{}= \\left(\\sqrt{x} - {1 \\over \\sqrt{x}}\\right)^2 + 2 \\end{align} we show that the sum of a positive number x and its reciprocal is always greater than or equal to 2. The square of a real expression is always greater than or equal to zero, which gives the stated bound; and here we achieve 2 just when x is 1, causing the square to vanish. ===Example: factoring a simple quartic polynomial=== Consider the problem of factoring the polynomial :x^4 + 324 . This is :(x^2)^2 + (18)^2, so the middle term is 2(x2)(18) = 36x2. Thus we get :\\begin{align} x^4 + 324 &{}= (x^4 + 36x^2 + 324 ) - 36x^2 \\\\\\ &{}= (x^2 + 18)^2 - (6x)^2 =\\text{a difference of two squares} \\\\\\ &{}= (x^2 + 18 + 6x)(x^2 + 18 - 6x) \\\\\\ &{}= (x^2 + 6x + 18)(x^2 - 6x + 18) \\end{align} (the last line being added merely to follow the convention of decreasing degrees of terms). The same argument shows that x^4 + 4a^4 is always factorizable as :x^4 + 4a^4 =(x^2+2a x + 2a^2)(x^2-2 ax + 2a^2) (Also known as Sophie-Germain Identity). ==References== *Algebra 1, Glencoe, , pages 539\u2013544 *Algebra 2, Saxon, , pages 214\u2013214, 241\u2013242, 256\u2013257, 398\u2013401 ==External links== * Category:Elementary algebra Category:Articles containing proofs Category:Articles containing video clips ",
