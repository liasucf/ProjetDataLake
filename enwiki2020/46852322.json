It was operated as a taxi bus service by two owner/drivers, Joe Bowden and Roy Berglund. In 1950, it was rerouted via Liverpool, Elizabeth, Park and George Streets to terminate in Bathurst Street outside the Sydney Town Hall.\"Town Hall to Tamarama\" Australian Bus issue 66 November 2014 pages 10-17 On 26 February 1950, Bowden's commenced operating route 244 Waverley to Bondi Junction under contract to the Department of Government Transport (DGT) after the previous operator ceased trading. It was taken over by the DGT on 21 February 1952. In September 1953, Bowden's assumed full control of route 79. With declining patronage and pick up restrictions in areas already served by Public Transport Commission, the service became unprofitable and services ceased on 5 June 1974. The Public Transport Commission's Waverley depot took over the route the following day, later renumbering it 376. ==Fleet== When operations ceased in June 1974, Bowden's operated 11 buses. ==References== Category:Bus companies of New South Wales Category:Bus transport in Sydney Category:Transport companies established in 1948 Category:Transport companies disestablished in 1974 Category:Australian companies established in 1948 Category:Defunct bus companies of Australia Category:Australian companies disestablished in 1974 ",
