    "text": "The Grand Hotel Wien is a five-star luxury hotel in Vienna, Austria. It is located on the Ringstra\u00dfe at K\u00e4rntner Ring 9. ==History== The hotel has a long history and tradition. The architect was Carl Tietz, and it was opened as the first Viennese luxury hotel in 1870. It originally had over 300 rooms, 200 bathrooms, a steam-powered elevator, and a telegraph office. The hotel became an instant hit with the aristocracy and became a popular meeting place, since it was centrally located for the Korso restaurant. In 1894, the waltz king Johann Strau\u00df II celebrated his 50-year stage anniversary at the hotel. In 1911, the hotel was extended into the neighbouring buildings at K\u00e4rntner Ring 11 and 13. Also, all rooms had their own telephones installed. After World War II, the hotel housed Soviet troops from 1945 to 1955. The hotel reopened for regular business in 1958, but was sold to the Austrian government. The government rented the building to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which located its headquarters there until 1979, when IAEA moved to the Vienna International Centre. Ten years later, All Nippon Airways purchased the hotel and began an ambitious reconstruction. The hotel was reduced to its original size and completely refurbished and renovated. The historical fa\u00e7ade by Tietz was restored, while the interior was modernized. The hotel was renamed \"ANA Grand Hotel\" and reopened in 1994. ANA sold the hotel in 2002 to the JJW Hotels & Resorts group, and the name reverted to \"Grand Hotel Wien\". ==References== * Fodor's Vienna to Salzburg - Inc.
