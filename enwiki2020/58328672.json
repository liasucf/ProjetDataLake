A member of the Northern Branch (Hokke) of the Fujiwara clan, he was the second son of and the younger brother of Fujiwara no Tomoie. He reached the Junior Second Rank at court, and founded the Kamiyagawa lineage (\u7d19\u5c4b\u6cb3\u5bb6 Kamiyagawa-ke) within the Rokuj\u014d branch of the Fujiwara clan. He is occasionally mentioned in the Azuma Kagami as a court envoy to Kant\u014d (\u95a2\u6771\u7957\u5019). He died on the eighth day of the eleventh month of Bun'ei 11 (1274). == Poetry == Akiuji was a central figure in the Kamakura waka poetic circle, and in Kyoto helped establish the anti- faction, along with his brother Tomoie and Fujiwara no Mitsutoshi. His poetry was a regular fixture in the uta-awase contests and other poetic gatherings organized by the members of this faction, but it was not highly appreciated. His poems were included in the records of a large number of uta-awase, including the Kasuga Wakamiya-sha Uta-awase (\u6625\u65e5\u82e5\u5bae\u793e\u6b4c\u5408) and the Munetaka-shinn\u014d- ke Hyakugoj\u016b-ban Uta-awase (\u5b97\u5c0a\u89aa\u738b\u5bb6\u767e\u4e94\u5341\u756a\u6b4c\u5408), as well as in the H\u014dji On-hyakushu (\u5b9d\u6cbb\u5fa1\u767e\u9996). His poems were also included in private anthologies that collected the works of Kamakura poets, including the T\u014dsen Waka Rokuj\u014d (\u6771\u64b0\u548c\u6b4c\u516d\u5e16), the Genzon Waka Rokuj\u014d (\u73fe\u5b58\u548c\u6b4c\u516d\u5e16) and the Un'y\u014d Wakash\u016b. Eleven of his poems were included in imperial anthologies from the Shoku Gosensh\u016b on. He left a personal collection, the Akiuji-sh\u016b, == References == === Citations === === Works cited === * * Category:Waka poets Category:13th-century Japanese poets Category:Kuge Category:1207 births Category:1274 deaths ",
