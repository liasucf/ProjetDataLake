Marat Safin could not defend his 2005 title, due to an injury he suffered in late 2005. Roger Federer won his second Australian Open title, defeating Marcos Baghdatis in the final in four sets. Serena Williams was unsuccessful in defending her 2005 title, losing in the third round against Daniela Hantuchov\u00e1. Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo won her first Australian Open title, defeating 2004 champion Justine Henin in the final; Henin-Hardenne was forced to retire at 1\u20136, 0\u20132 down due to a stomach virus. It began Henin-Hardenne's run of reaching the final of all four Grand Slam events, winning the French Open. == Leadup == Several leading men's players declined to attend the Open due to injury, including Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal and defending champion Marat Safin. The women's tournament had no absentees among the top 20 ranked players. It was Martina Hingis' first grand slam event in her comeback to the game. Lindsay Davenport and Serena Williams were among those who welcomed her return to the circuit as a positive step forward for women's tennis. == Day- by-day schedules == === Day 1 (16 January) === {| class=\"wikitable collapsible uncollapsed\" !colspan=4| |- !colspan=4|Matches on Rod Laver Arena |- !Event !Winner !Loser !Score |- | Women's Singles 1st Round | Lindsay Davenport [1] | Casey Dellacqua [WC] | 6\u20132, 6\u20131 |- | Men's Singles 1st Round | David Nalbandian [4] | Danai Udomchoke [Q] | 6\u20132, 6\u20132, 1\u20136, 6\u20137(4\u20137), 6\u20131 |- | Women's Singles 1st Round | Maria Sharapova [4] | Sandra Kloesel | 6\u20132, 6\u20131 |-bgcolor=\"#FFFFCC\" | Women's Singles 1st Round | Serena Williams [13] | Li Na | 6\u20133, 6\u20137 (1\u20137), 6\u20132 |-bgcolor=\"#FFFFCC\" | Men's Singles 1st Round | Andy Roddick [2] | Michael Lammer [Q] | 6\u20134, 6\u20132, 6\u20132 |- !colspan=4|Matches on Melbourne Arena |- !
