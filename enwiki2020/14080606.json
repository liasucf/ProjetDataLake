Massive Snowboarding allows the player to choose from up to five different characters in different modes.Score, Avery. Massive Snowboarding for Mobile Review. GameSpot. September 6, 2005. Retrieved November 4, 2007. In the main career mode, there are three different types of gameplay available: Ride Challenge, Rival Race, and Video Shoot. Most of the game takes place in Ride Challenge, where you are given certain objectives to complete before reaching the bottom of the slope, ranging from gaining a certain number of points through tricks to executing a certain trick. Rival race is just as it sounds - racing another player down the slope. Video shoot tasks you with earning a certain point value on only one huge jump. Control is simple. Hold down the \"5\" button on the keypad to crouch - let go of it to jump. By pressing other buttons, you can execute tricks in the air and string together combos. ==Reception== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Reviews and awards !Publication !Score !Comment |- |IGN |9.0/10 |Wireless Buyer's Guide pickIGN Holiday Buyer's Guide 2005 .
