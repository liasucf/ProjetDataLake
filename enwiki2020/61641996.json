    "text": "Line segments with identical markings are parallel. If the sides of the triangleA'B'C' are parallel to the according cevians of triangle ABC, which are intersecting in a common point V', then the cevians of triangle A'B'C', which are parallel to the according sides of triangle ABC intersect in a common point V' as well Maxwell's theorem is the following statement about triangles in the plane. :For a given triangle ABC and a point V not on the sides of that triangle construct a second triangle A'B'C', such that the side A'B' is parallel to the line segment CV, the side A'C' is parallel to the line segment BV and the side B'C' is parallel to the line segment AV. Then the parallel to AB through C', the parallel to BC through A' and the parallel to AC through B' intersect in a common point V'. The theorem is named after the physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831\u20131879), who proved it in his work on reciprocal figures, which are of importance in statics. == References == * Daniel Pedoe: Geometry: A Comprehensive Course.
