    "text": "The voiced velar nasal, also known as agma, from the Greek word for 'fragment', is a type of consonantal sound used in some spoken languages. It is the sound of ng in English sing as well as n before velar consonants as in English and ink. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is `N`. The IPA symbol is similar to , the symbol for the retroflex nasal, which has a rightward-pointing hook extending from the bottom of the right stem, and to , the symbol for the palatal nasal, which has a leftward-pointing hook extending from the bottom of the left stem. Both the IPA symbol and the sound are commonly called 'eng' or 'engma'. As a phoneme, the velar nasal does not occur in many of the indigenous languages of the Americas or in many European or Middle Eastern or Caucasian languages, but it is extremely common in Australian Aboriginal languages and is also common in many languages of Sub- Saharan Africa, East Asia, Southeast Asia and Polynesia. While almost all languages have and , is rarer.. The oral counterparts are found together in almost all languages Only half of the 469 languages surveyed in had a velar nasal phoneme; as a further curiosity, a large proportion of them limits its occurrence to the syllable coda. In many languages that do not have the velar nasal as a phoneme, it occurs as an allophone of before velar consonants. An example of it used this way is the English word ingredient, which can be pronounced as either or . An example of a language that lacks a phonemic or allophonic velar nasal is Russian, in which is pronounced as laminal denti- alveolar even before velar consonants. Some languages have the pre-velar nasal,Instead of \"pre-velar\", it can be called \"advanced velar\", \"fronted velar\", \"front-velar\", \"palato-velar\", \"post-palatal\", \"retracted palatal\" or \"backed palatal\". which is articulated slightly more front compared with the place of articulation of the prototypical velar nasal, though not as front as the prototypical palatal nasal - see that article for more information. Conversely, some languages have the post-velar nasal,Instead of \"post-velar\", it can be called \"retracted velar\", \"backed velar\", \"pre-uvular\", \"advanced uvular\" or \"fronted uvular\". which is articulated slightly behind the place of articulation of a prototypical velar nasal, though not as back as the prototypical uvular nasal. ==Features== Features of the voiced velar nasal: ==Occurrence== {| class=\"wikitable\" !colspan=2| Language !!
