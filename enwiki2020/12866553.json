The lantern room and stairs inside the lighthouse were removed, and the wood roof, the lighthouse keeper, door and windows are missing. Currently, no humans live on the island, and it is mostly inhabited by birds. It is an important nesting and loafing area for gulls, terns and cormorants; furthermore, the island provides a stopover site for migratory birds such as Canada geese. In 1977, the Canadian government established the island as Mohawk Island National Wildlife Area to protect nesting birds.
