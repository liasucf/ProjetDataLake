He is a former player for the Indonesia U-23 Team. During his first 3 seasons at Semen Padang, Rommy just sat on the bench. In 2003, his career took off under the direction of his coach, Suhatman Imam, and he was featured in the premier line-up. That confidence was repaid with good performances, and guaranteed a strong defence for Semen Padang. His performance received special appreciation from Sergei Dubrovin, coach of the national team of Vietnam for the Sea Games XXII. He became the first choice as defence of the \u2018Merah Putih\u2019 team. \"More his age, he more adult or mature.
