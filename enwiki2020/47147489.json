EDICs have the typical landing craft utility design with a bow ramp and have a large aft superstructure compared to the derivative CDIC. The EDIC vessels were constructed in three groups, the first were launched in 1958, the second in 1967\u20131969 and the third in 1987. A sub class, called the Engin de d\u00e9barquement ateliers or EDA was constructed between the first and second groups but were fitted out as repair craft. In French service, they predominately were used in the French Pacific territories. ==Design and description== The EDIC type landing craft were constructed in three batches and had differences between them. They were designed as tank landing craft for the French Navy. The first and second batches as built had a standard displacement of and at full load. They were long with a beam of and a draught of . They were powered by two MGO diesel engines driving two shafts rated at . They had a maximum speed of and a complement of 16 including one officer. They could carry eleven trucks or five tracked landing vehicles. They mounted two anti-aircraft (AA) guns. The third EDIC group were constructed to a modified design with a standard displacement of and at full load. The vessels measure long with a beam of and a draught of . They are powered by two SACM Uni Diesel UD30 V12 M3 diesel engines driving two shafts rated at . They have a maximum speed of and a range of at 12 knots. The EDIC III type have capacity for of vehicles and can carry up to 180 personnel. They landing craft have a complement of ten. They mount a Racal Decca 226 radar, two 20 mm mod\u00e8le F2 guns for AA defence and two machine guns. ===Lebanese Navy=== Two vessels in service with the Lebanese Navy are of EDIC III design. They have a displacement of at full load and measure long with a beam of and a draught of . The two landing craft are powered by two SACM MGO 175 V12 M1 diesel engines turning two shafts rated at . The ships have a maximum speed of and a range of at . They can carry up to 96 troops and 11 AML 90 / Humvee lightweight fighting vehicles or 8 M113 armored personnel carrier. The vessels mount two Oerlikon 20 mm cannon, one mortar, two 12.7 mm machine guns and one machine gun. ===EDA type=== Four ships were constructed to similar dimensions and propulsion system to the first two EDIC groups in 1964\u20131965 and called the Engin de d\u00e9barquement ateliers or EDA. Instead of being landing craft, they were equipped as repair and logistics ships for service on overseas stations. L 9084 was classified as an auxiliary electrical stores ship. ==Ships in class== {|border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable collapsible\" |- | colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#eee;\" align=center | EDIC |- !

Seven were built by Chantier Naval Franco-Belge, three by the Toulon Dockyard and two by La Perri\u00e8re in France. The EDIC IIIs were built by SFCN at Villeneuve-la- Garenne, France. On 1 July 1974 L 9095 was transferred to Senegal and renamed La Falence. Most of the class was deployed to the French territories in the Pacific. In 1981, L 9082 was paid off. On 28 September 1985, L 9082 was sold to Madagascar and renamed Aina Vao Vao. The ship was repaired in 1996. L 9083 and L 9073 were stricken from the French Navy in 1986, L 9091, L 9093, L 9096 in 1988, L 9094 in 1991 and L 9072 in 1993. Sabre and Dague were given their names on 29 April 1999. On 7 November 1983, the Lebanese Navy loaned L 9096 from the French Navy and renamed the vessel Sour. The ship was later returned to the French Navy. That year, they ordered two EDIC III vessels from SFCN to be built in Villeneuve-la-Garenne, France. The two ships, named Sour and Damour, were commissioned into the Lebanese Navy on 28 March 1991. Both had been damaged in 1990 and repaired the following year. ==Citations== ==References== * * * * Category:Amphibious warfare vessel classes Category:Cold War amphibious warfare vessels of France ",
