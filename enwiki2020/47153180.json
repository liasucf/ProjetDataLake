The eventual heir of de Raleigh was the Chichester family. The de Raleigh family subinfeudated Ruxford to de Sully. The inquisition post mortem of Sir John Chichester (d. 1569) of Raleigh dated 2 January 1569 lists Ruxford as held by him from Queen Elizabeth \"as of her Manor of Bradninch\", which is the last surviving record of its dependency from the feudal barony of Bradninch.Maddock, vol.1, p.22 =====Sully===== Effigies of Sir John de Sully (1282-1388), KG, and his wife Isobel exist in Crediton Parish Church.
