She was one of six children of James S. Wadsworth and Mary Craig Wharton Wadsworth. Adair grew up in a wealthy family who owned over 50,000 acres of land near Geneseo, New York. Her Wadsworth ancestors established Hartford, Connecticut, after moving from the Massachusetts Colony. She became an accomplished horserider which encouraged her interests in traveling across the prairies of the western United States. In 1876, her second husband became a partner with Charles Goodnight to found the JA Ranch. When her second husband died, she became partner. She enjoyed hunting and participated at roundups. She founded a hospital, and supported building the Clarendon YMCA building. In addition to her life on the ranch, Adair \"spent much of her time in her fashionable house in London\" and stayed at a Rathdaire, Ireland, cottage and at her Glenveagh Castle in Donegal, Ireland. In retirement, she built a home in Bath, England. == Family == She was married to Montgomery Ritchie from 1857 until his death in 1864 from complications after serving in the Civil War. They had two children. In 1869, she married John George (Jack) Adair, a Scottish-Irish businessman and landowner. Following the wedding, the couple moved to Geneseo, New York. The couple divided their time between Ireland, England, and New York until his death in Missouri in 1885. Her great-grand daughter is Cornelia Wadsworth Ritchie, who continued the family's ownership of JA Ranch. Adair died in London while on vacation. == Works == * My diary, August 30 to November 5, 1874 introduction by Montagu K. Brown, illustrations by Malcolm Thurgood.
