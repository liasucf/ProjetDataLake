    "text": "Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles de las Heras Ortiz (4 October 1944 \u2013 25 March 2006), better known professionally as Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal (), was a Spanish singer and actress. In 2005 D\u00farcal received a Latin Grammy Award for musical excellence, a prize that is awarded by the Governing Board of the Recording Latin Academy to artists who have made creative contributions of outstanding artistic significance during their careers. == Career == D\u00farcal began her artistic career by participating in various radio song festivals and competitions, secretly supported by her paternal grandfather, who always believed in her talent and became her first fan. In 1959, with the approval of her parents, she participated in the television program Primer Aplauso, broadcast by Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola. The theme that she chose for the contest was the traditional song \"La sombra vendo\". Luis Sanz, a Madrid manager who watched the show, was impressed by her talent and personality. Sanz contacted the program for the name and the address of the young contestant. === Acting === Her first film was Canci\u00f3n de Juventud (1961) directed by Luis Lucia. The plot of the film portrayed a teenager with her own personality. The movie scored huge box office and critics success. This success was repeated in other Spanish-speaking countries where the movie was shown. Immediately D\u00farcal became the star of Roc\u00edo de La Mancha. Following this, she got her first record deal with transnational Phonogram (now Universal Music). The songs the artist played in both films served to make her first album, Las pel\u00edculas de Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal (1962). In D\u00farcal's third film, Tengo 17 a\u00f1os (1964), she put aside her role of \"child star\". That same year, she appeared in her first theater play, Un domingo en Nueva York, in which she was revealed as a great theatrical actress. In 1965 she filmed M\u00e1s bonita que ninguna; the band Los Brincos wrote some songs for the movie. In 1966, she shared the spotlight with Enrique Guzm\u00e1n in the film Acomp\u00e1\u00f1ame. She began to perform duets with such singers as Jaime Morey and Amalia de Isaura. Then she co-starred in the film Amor en el Aire (1967) with the then young Argentine singer-songwriter Palito Ortega. In 1968 she filmed Cristina Guzm\u00e1n, the first of her films that was aimed at an audience over 18. Her last film was with B\u00e1rbara Rey in Me Siento Extra\u00f1a in 1977. === Singing === In 1970 D\u00farcal married Filipino-born musician Antonio Morales (known professionally as J\u00fanior), who would manage her singing career. In 1972, Antonio Morales began a series of television shows in Spain and Latin America singing with his wife as a duet. Their first child, Spanish actress Carmen Morales de las Heras, was born in December 1970. After the birth of their second child, Antonio Morales de las Heras, in April 1974, Morales decided to give up his career to devote time to their children. D\u00farcal meanwhile continued her film and singing career. In 1979 she had her third child, Shaila Morales de las Heras, who took up a singing career under the stage name of Shaila D\u00farcal and is also a successful singer. In 1977, D\u00farcal signed a contract with Ariola Eurodisc (with singer-songwriter Camilo Sesto supporting her in her projects) dedicating herself to the musical career. That year, while in Mexico, she met the Mexican singer-songwriter Alberto Aguilera Valadez, better known as Juan Gabriel, who decided to record a whole album of rancheras performed by Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal entitled Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal canta a Juan Gabriel. Without further advertising, the LP received high levels of sales, so D\u00farcal and Juan Gabriel considered the possibility of a new recording together. They ended up doing 5 LPs, marking the revival of Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal as a singer. The final collaboration between D\u00farcal and Juan Gabriel emerged in 10 albums. D\u00farcal's album named Canta A Juan Gabriel Volumen 6 (1984) is among the top ten best-selling albums in the history of Mexico. For this album Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal received her first Grammy Award nomination. The collaboration of D\u00farcal with Juan Gabriel was interrupted by disagreements between the artists and because of problems of Juan Gabriel with his record label, so D\u00farcal continued to record albums with other songwriters such as Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds and Rafael P\u00e9rez Botija (with whom under his leadership in 1981 she recorded the album of ballads Confidencias). In 1988 she recorded the album Como Tu Mujer with producer Marco Antonio Solis. In 1990, she recorded her first album on CD format entitled Si Te Pudiera Mentir. In 1991, Durcal offered a concert at the National Auditorium in Mexico City, recorded in a double disc El Concierto... En Vivo. Between 1992 and 1993 she recorded the album Desaires, produced by the Mexican singer and songwriter Joan Sebasti\u00e1n. In this album she reprises ranchera. In 1995 she launched her production Hay Amores Y Amores, with songs written and produced by the Argentine Roberto Livi. For this album she is nominated again to the Grammy Awards in the category \"Best Latin Pop Album\". In 1997 the double album Juntos Otra Vez brought Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal and Juan Gabriel together again for the last time. That album was made by an engagement with the record company and not by the desire of both artists to continue to cooperate. In 1998, under the direction of her discoverer Luis Sanz, D\u00farcal starred in the Spanish TV Show Los negocios de mam\u00e1, broadcast by Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola. In 2000, she celebrated 40 years in the industry. In that year she returned to ranchera music with the album Caricias, under the production of songwriter and producer Bebu Silvetti. In 2001 Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal recorded Entre Tangos Y Mariachi, again produced by Bebu Silvetti, an album that includes 10 of the most famous Argentine tango arrangements interpreted with ranchero/bolero style like her previous album. In the summer of 2001 D\u00farcal made a successful tour in Spain, after 13 years of no shows in Spain. After a year and a half absence, she returned to the stage on 19 September 2002 with a concert at the National Auditorium in Mexico, which was recorded in a double album that was released on CD and then on DVD on 22 October 2002, En Concierto... Inolvidable. The album was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award. In 2003, the artist received another Latin Grammy Award nomination for her album Caramelito, produced by Kike Santander. In May 2004 she returned to Spain to record what would be her last album Alma Ranchera, which was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award, but did not win. == Illness and death == Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal's crypt at Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City In 2001, after recording her album Entre Tangos y Mariachi, D\u00farcal was diagnosed with uterine cancer. D\u00farcal canceled her tours while subjected to medical treatments, and came back to her tours in 2002. In 2003, from Spain, she collaborated with the Mexican singer Julio Preciado for a duet in the song \"Si nos dejan\" included in his album Que me siga la tambora. Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal died on 25 March 2006 at the age of 61 from uterine cancer at her home in Torrelodones, Madrid. She was cremated and a portion of her ashes were scattered in Spain while the remainder of her ashes were deposited into a crypt at Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City, the same place where years later a portion of the ashes from her husband Antonio Morales who died in 2014, were also deposited next to her. == Select discography == === Albums === ; Philips-Phonogram * 1962: Canci\u00f3n de Juventud * 1963: Roc\u00edo de la Mancha * 1963: Las Pel\u00edculas de Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal * 1964: La Cenicienta Del Barrio (La Chica del Tr\u00e9bol) * 1964: Roc\u00edo, Canta Flamenco (EP) * 1964: Tengo 17 A\u00f1os * 1964: Villancicos de Roc\u00edo (EP) * 1964: Villancicos con Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal (EP) * 1965: M\u00e1s Bonita Que Ninguna * 1966: Acomp\u00e1\u00f1ame * 1967: Buenos D\u00edas, Condesita * 1967: Amor En El Aire * 1968: Cristina Guzm\u00e1n * 1970: Las Leandras * 1972: La Novicia So\u00f1adora (La Novicia Rebelde) ; Ariola Eurodisc * 1977: Una Vez M\u00e1s (Pronto) * 1977: Canta a Juan Gabriel Volumen I (Pronto) * 1978: Canta a Juan Gabriel Volumen II (Pronto) * 1979: S\u00faper \u00c9xitos De Juan Gabriel (Canta a Juan Gabriel Volumen III) (Pronto) * 1980: Canta con Mariachi Volumen IV (Producida por Juan Gabriel) (Pronto) * 1981: Canta a Juan Gabriel Volumen V (Cuando Decidas Volver) (Pronto) * 1981: Confidencias (La Gata) (Pronto) * 1982: Canta Lo Rom\u00e1ntico De Juan Gabriel (Boleros) (Pronto) * 1983: Entre T\u00fa y Yo (Ariola) * 1984: Canta A Juan Gabriel Volumen 6 (Jardin De Rosas) (Ariola) * 1986: Siempre (Ariola) * 1987: Canta 11 Grandes \u00c9xitos De Juan Gabriel (Ariola) * 1988: Como Tu Mujer (Ariola) * 1990: Si Te Pudiera Mentir (Ariola) * 1992: El Concierto...
