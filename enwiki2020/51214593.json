    "text": "Front page of the first issue Le Moderniste Illustr\u00e9 was a short-lived French illustrated weekly published in Paris on Saturdays from 6 April to 28 September 1889. A total of 23 issues were produced on modernist art and literature. The editor-in-chief was Andr\u00e9 Henry and the managing editor was Albert Aurier. Issues were sold for 20 centimes. The complete run was reprinted in facsimile by Slatkine Reprints in Geneva in 1971. The journal is primarily remembered for Aurier's favourable early critique of the, then obscure, artist Vincent Van Gogh. In Le Moderniste he described Van Gogh's paintings as \"tremendous in their ardor, intensity, sunshine.\" Aurier would later go on to champion the work of Van Gogh in Mercure de France. ==References== Category:1889 establishments in France Category:1889 disestablishments in France Category:Defunct literary magazines published in France Category:French-language magazines Category:Magazines established in 1889 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1889 Category:Magazines published in Paris Category:Weekly magazines published in France ",
