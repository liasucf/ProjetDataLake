The film was released by Warner Bros. on March 18, 1950. ==Plot== Gold-mine operator \"Boss\" Kruger (Raymond Massey) has certainly earned his nickname. A frontier dictator, Kruger runs his mine like a prison colony. Most of his workers are, in fact, fugitives from justice and are given dubious \"protection\" by Kruger. Two of the laborers are Judith Burns (Ruth Roman) and Bob Peters (Dane Clark), both on the lam from the law. Judith and Bob befriend lawyer Aubrey Milburn (Robert Douglas), who seeks to prove that Kruger is a murderer. == Cast == * Dane Clark as Bob Peters * Raymond Massey as Boss Kruger * Ruth Roman as Judith Burns * Robert Douglas as Aubrey Milburn * Morgan Farley as The Judge * Walter Coy as Benson * George Stern as Tippy * Robert Griffin as Kirby * Frank Marlowe as Brandy * Tony Mart\u00ednez as Peso == References == == External links == * * * * Category:1950 films Category:American films Category:English- language films Category:Warner Bros. films Category:American Western (genre) films Category:1950 Western (genre) films Category:Films directed by Peter Godfrey Category:Films scored by William Lava Category:Mining in film ",
