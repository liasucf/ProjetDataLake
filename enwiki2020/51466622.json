The club was member of the Workers' Confederation of Sports (AIF) and was an early rival of V\u00e5lerengens Idrettsforening. ==History== Jordal IF was founded in 1921 as Olymp. The club was not accepted into the Football Association of Norway after applying in both 1921 and 1922. Instead it joined the Workers' Confederation of Sports which had been formed in 1924 as a socialist counterweight to the Norwegian Confederation of Sports. Over the years, the club had sections for association football, athletics, bandy, ice hockey, handball, and volleyball. Jordal Idrettsforening was dissolved in 2011. ==References== ==External links== Category:Association football clubs established in 1921 Category:Bandy clubs established in 1921 Category:1921 establishments in Norway Category:Football clubs in Oslo Category:2011 disestablishments in Norway Category:Defunct bandy clubs in Norway Category:Arbeidernes Idrettsforbund ",
