Medieval chronicles unanimously stated that the Sz\u00e9kelys were descended from the Huns and settled in the Carpathian Basin centuries before the Hungarians (or Magyars) conquered the territory in the late 9th century. This theory is refuted by most modern specialists. According to a widely accepted modern hypothesis, the Sz\u00e9kelys were originally a Turkic people who joined the Magyars in the Pontic steppes. Other scholars say, the Sz\u00e9kelys were descended from the border guards of the Kingdom of Hungary who settled in the easternmost region of the Carpathian Basin and preserved their special privileges for centuries. According to a fourth theory, the Sz\u00e9kelys' origin can be traced back to the Late Avar population of the Carpathian Basin. == Medieval chronicles == Medieval chronicles associated the Sz\u00e9kelys with the Huns, also claiming that both the Huns and the Hungarians were descended from the Scythians. Medieval scholars also agreed that the Sz\u00e9kelys had already been present in the Carpathian Basin before the Hungarians (or Magyars) conquered the territory. The early 13th- century Gesta Hungarorum was the first to mention that the Sz\u00e9kelys \"were previously the peoples\"Anonymus, Notary of King B\u00e9la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 50.), p. 109. of Attila the Hun. According to the same source, the Sz\u00e9kelys \"gave their sons as hostages along with diverse gifts\" to the Hungarian chieftain, \u0150sb\u0151, at the K\u00f6r\u00f6s River before joining his campaign against Menumorut. Simon of K\u00e9za stated that the Sz\u00e9kelys were \"remnants of the Huns\" who \"remained on the field of Csigla\"Simon of K\u00e9za: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 21.), p. 71. after the fall of the Hunnic Empire. In contrast with the Gesta Hungarorum, K\u00e9za said, the Sz\u00e9kelys joined the Hungarians \"on the borders of Ruthenia\" when the Hungarians crossed the Carpathian Mountains. All subsequent Hungarian chronicles repeated K\u00e9za's story and most scholars accepted the identification of the Sz\u00e9kelys with the Huns for centuries. The theory was also mentioned in Istv\u00e1n Werb\u0151czy's Tripartitum, which was published several times in Sz\u00e9kely Land after 1517. As a consequence, it cannot be decided whether the Sz\u00e9kelys' well-documented own tradition of their Hunnic origin is a genuine part of their folklore, or it is only an adoption of a medieval scholarly fabrication. Most Sz\u00e9kelys still regard themselves as descendants of the Huns, but the majority of modern scholars refute this theory. == Modern scholarship == The linguist P\u00e1l Hunfalvy was the first scholar to question the association of the Sz\u00e9kelys with the Huns in the 1870s. However, scholars have not reached a consensus about the origin of the Sz\u00e9kelys. The modern theories can be divided into three major groups. === Late Avars === Medieval chronicles are evidence that the Sz\u00e9kelys were regarded as a distinct ethnic group which had settled in the Carpathian Basin before the Hungarians. Some scholars (especially Gyula L\u00e1szl\u00f3 and P\u00e1l Engel) say that the Sz\u00e9kelys are the direct descendants of the \"Late Avar\" population of the region. The \"Late Avar\" period started around 700 A.D., and lasted for about a century. Artifacts (mostly buckles and strap ends) decorated with floral patterns and griffins are the most featured items of the assemblages for this period. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 and Engel attribute this new archaeological horizon to a group of Onogurs who had fled from the Pontic steppes to the West after the Khazars destroyed their empire around 680. According to most scholars, the Onogurs spoke a Turkic language, but L\u00e1szl\u00f3 proposed that they were a Hungarian- speaking group. A charter of Louis the German, King of East Francia, mentioned the Wangariorum marcas (\"Wangars' frontier\") around 860, implying that Onogurs still lived in the westernmost region of the Carpathian Basin in the second half of the 9th century. Most scholars refute the association of the Sz\u00e9kelys with the \"Late Avars\" or Onogurs. === Social group: Hungarian border guards === The Sz\u00e9kelys speak the Hungarian language \"without any trace of a Turkic substratum\", indicating that they did not have a language shift during their history, according to scholars, who propose that the Sz\u00e9kelys were descended from privileged Hungarian groups. Most place names in Sz\u00e9kely Land are of Hungarian origin, showing that the Sz\u00e9kelys spoke Hungarian when they settled in the region. The three main Hungarian dialects of Sz\u00e9kely Land are closely connected to the Hungarian variants spoken along the western and southwestern borders of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. The dialect of the Sz\u00e9kelys of Marossz\u00e9k is similar to the dialects spoken by the Hungarian communities near Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia) and in southern Burgenland. The Hungarian variant of Udvarhelysz\u00e9k is closely related to the tongue of the Hungarians in Baranya County and Slavonia. The easternmost Sz\u00e9kely communities' dialect is connected to the Hungarian variant of Burgenland. Other important social phenomenon supports the social group thesis. If Sz\u00e9kely men moved to the cities or towns in Sz\u00e9kelyland, they lost their Sz\u00e9kely social status and identity immediately, moreover the new townsmen and the Sz\u00e9kely villagers considered each other as extraneous. It also confirms that Sz\u00e9kelys considered themselves as a special Hungarian social group rather than a real separate ethnic group in the medieval and early modern period.Judit Balogh: Sz\u00e9kelyudvarhely v\u00e1rosi elitj\u00e9nek kialakul\u00e1sa a 16-17. sz\u00e1zad fordul\u00f3j\u00e1n (The development of the elite of the towns in Sz\u00e9kelyudvarhely) LINK: A very similar social phenomenon and a new strong local identity emerged in Hajd\u00fas\u00e1g region of Hungary in the early modern period, when the Hajd\u00fa soldiers got feudal privileges and own territory from prince Stephen Bocskai. === Associated people === According to a widely accepted scholarly theory, the Sz\u00e9kelys had originally been a Turkic people who joined the Magyars in the Pontic steppes (to the east of the Carpathian Basin). Written sources evidence, the Sz\u00e9kelys were regarded a separate ethnic group in the Middle Ages. Simon of K\u00e9za wrote of the \"Hungarian and Sz\u00e9kely forces\"Simon of K\u00e9za: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 71.), p. 145. of Andrew II of Hungary; a charter of William, Bishop of Transylvania, distinguished the Hungarians and Sz\u00e9kelys in 1213. The Sz\u00e9kelys were listed along with other peoples in the Middle Ages, also indicating that they were considered an ethnic group. In 1250, a royal charter enumerated the Saxons, Vlachs, Sz\u00e9kelys and Pechenegs when mentioning a campaign against Bulgaria; the 14th-century Hungarian chronicles wrote of Sz\u00e9kelys and Pechenegs participating in the Battle of Ol\u0161ava. == Alternative theories == Humanist scholar Petrus Ransanus was the first to propose an alternative theory about the origin of the Sz\u00e9kelys. Based on the Latin Siculus form of their ethnonym, he said that Sicilian soldiers who allegedly fought in the army in Attila the Hun were the Sz\u00e9kelys' ancestors. Jesuit priest Ferenc Fasching stated that the Sz\u00e9kelys were descended from a Jasz group whom B\u00e9la IV of Hungary had supposedly settled in Transylvania. Nicolae Iorga proposed that the Sz\u00e9kelys were originally Romanians, but he abandoned this theory. == References == == Sources == === Primary sources === * Anonymus, Notary of King B\u00e9la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (Edited, Translated and Annotated by Martyn Rady and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Veszpr\u00e9my) (2010).
