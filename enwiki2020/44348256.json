It is managed by the Moran Yacht & Ship chartering business, and is owned by Pakistani-American billionaire Shahid Khan. The word kismet means \"destiny\" or \"fate\" in many languages. It was finished in a luxurious style by Reymond Langton and Espen \u00d8eino, with an expensive interior design. The fittings were specified to be better than a \"five star hotel\", featuring a deck of black marble and a large bath made of solid onyx. The yacht is complete with a swimming pool, barbecue area, movie theatre, sauna, helipad, elevator and gymnasium. Other amenities and provisions include an onboard internet connection, underwater lighting, and stabilizers at the anchor and underway. Kismet can carry 28 crew members at a time, and has eight state rooms which provide a capacity for 16 guests. Its design includes large and open public spaces for lounging and dining, and the rooms are stylized with exotic woods, handcrafted textiles, marble and leather. The exterior is notable for its large-sized windows across all decks. According to Yacht Harbour, Kismet is worth an estimated $200 million. It has a charter price of $1.2 million per week, excluding food, fuel and dockage costs. In mid-2018, the yacht was rented by Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 during a vacation to Italy. Kismet was featured in the 2019 Netflix film 6 Underground starring Ryan Reynolds. ==References== ==External links== * *Moran Yacht & Ship - Kismet project Category:2014 ships Category:Motor yachts Category:Shahid Khan Category:Ships built in Bremen (state) ",
