His father was named Malek Qorkhmaz, and he had a brother named Malek Atabek (Atabegi). One of his uncles, Tahmaspqoli, who was bestowed with the title An\u012bs ol-Dowleh, was the first influential gholam from the family. Safiqoli rose steadily through the Safavid ranks to become a yuzbashi (officer) early on in his career. Later on, in 1618-1619, he became prefect (darugha) of New Julfa in Isfahan, and was made governor (beglarbeg) of Hamadan shortly after, in 1619-1620. Following king Abbas I's recapture of Baghdad in 1624 during the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1623-1639, which ended many decades of Ottoman rule, Safiqoli was appointed as its new beglarbeg. In addition, he was made the local qurchi-bashi of the shrine city of Najaf. His two close relatives included Mihrab Khan (d. 1648/49) and Manuchehr (sometime beglarbeg of Shirvan). ==References== == Sources == * * * * Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1631 deaths Safiqoli Category:Iranian people of Georgian descent Category:Persian Armenians Category:Safavid governors of Baghdad Category:Safavid military officers Category:Safavid governors of Hamadan Category:Safavid prefects of New Julfa Category:Nobility of Georgia (country) Category:Ghilman Category:Shia Muslims from Georgia (country) Category:Ethnic Armenian Shia Muslims Category:17th- century people of the Safavid Empire ",
