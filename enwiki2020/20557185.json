    "text": "\"Life in Technicolor II\" (stylized \"Life in Technicolor ii\"), is a song by British rock band Coldplay and the first single from the band's 2008 EP, Prospekt's March. The song is the full, vocal version of the instrumental track \"Life in Technicolor\" from Coldplay's fourth studio album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends. A promo CD single for the song was released in December 2008. The official single was released on 2 February 2009 on 7\" vinyl and digital download. The single includes the previously unreleased and unheard track \"The Goldrush\", one of the few Coldplay songs featuring lead vocals by drummer Will Champion. It was nominated for two Grammy Award for the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards; \"Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal\" and \"Best Music Video\". \"Life in Technicolor II\" starts with a loop consisting of a santoor accompanied by tabla-like percussion. The loop is then repeated through the verses and part of the chorus. ==Music video== Coldplay performing \"Life in Technicolor II\" at the Parque Simon Bolivar, Bogota, Colombia, on March 4, 2010 The music video premiered on 20 January 2009 on 4Music and Channel 4. The video starts out with kids sitting and awaiting a traditional Punch and Judy puppet show and features the band performing as puppets in the Aldenham War Memorial Hall. However, the puppet show becomes increasingly extravagant as the video goes on, eventually featuring pyrotechnics and frontman Chris Martin crowd surfing over the children. Finally, the puppet band members board a small helicopter and after taking off, drummer Will Champion throws his drumsticks onto a random child before crashing through a window as they fly away.http://www.tampabays10.com/news/local/morning/story.aspx?storyid=100810&catid;=25 James Clarkson and Coldplay's fifth member, Phil Harvey, can be seen in the video.
