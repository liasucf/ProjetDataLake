    "text": "The Ni\u0161 Declaration () was a public declaration of war objectives of the Kingdom of Serbia made on 7 December 1914 after successful offensives of the Royal Serbian Army. The government issued a statement in Ni\u0161, approved by the National Assembly, which included a call for Yugoslav unification. It was stated that Serbia's objective was to unite the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes into a common state, to be established 'on the ruins of Austria-Hungary'. This state would become a pillar of stability in Europe, it was said. The Ni\u0161 Declaration did not recognise Macedonians as a separate \"tribe\". They were seen together with Bosniaks as an \"unformed element\" that could be eventually assimilated as Serbs. ==See also== *Corfu Declaration ==References== * * * Category:Yugoslav unification Category:Serbia in World War I Category:1914 in military history Category:1914 in politics Category:Politics of World War I Category:December 1914 events Category:Austria-Hungary\u2013Serbia relations Category:1914 in Serbia Category:1914 documents Category:History of Ni\u0161 ",
