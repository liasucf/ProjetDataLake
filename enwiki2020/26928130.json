It is crossed by the Ashland Mill Bridge in Griswold, Connecticut, a bridge which is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. == History == The Pachaug River was used by the Mohegan Indians, who constructed stone weirs to direct the water flow and funnel fish to the center of the stream for trapping. In 1974 and 1977, a fishing advisory said it was in good to excellent fishing location. In the 1970s, a plan was drawn up to pump 7.5 million gallons of water a day from the river into the Rattlesnack Brook, which in turn would feed the Broad Brook. ==See also== *List of rivers of Connecticut *List of rivers of Rhode Island ==References== Category:Rivers of New London County, Connecticut Category:Griswold, Connecticut Category:Rivers of Connecticut Category:Rivers of Rhode Island Category:Tributaries of the Thames River (Connecticut) ",
