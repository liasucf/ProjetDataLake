    "text": "This article provides information on the under 16 premiership deciders of rugbyleague competitions held on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia. The Match Details sub-section details the individual point-scorers in a match, where known. The current competition is conducted under the auspices of the Central Coast Division Junior Rugby League, an affiliate of NSW Country Rugby League and the New South Wales Rugby League. A predecessor to Under 16 and Under 17 competitions was D Grade, which was held from 1955 to 1966. When Group status was obtained in 1967, C and D Grade became Under 19 and Under 17. The following year they were changed to Under 18 and Under 16. Between 1979 and 1982 the two competitions reverted to Under 19 and Under 17. In 2000, Third Grade and Under 18s were replaced by Under 19 and Under 17 competitions. There has been an Under 17 competition in each subsequent season, apart from 2012. Since 2015, Under 17s has been run by the junior body and played on Saturdays, rather than as a curtain-raiser to Sunday grade matches. ==List== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+Under 17 Grand Finals !
