    "text": "In Your House 6 (retroactively titled In Your House 6: Rage in the Cage) was the sixth In Your House professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), which took place on February 18, 1996, at the Louisville Gardens in Louisville, Kentucky. The main event of the show was a Steel Cage match, in which reigning WWF World Heavyweight Champion Bret Hart defended the championship against Diesel. With the launch of the WWE Network in 2014 this show became available on demand, but does not include the three dark matches held after the main show. ==Storylines== The professional wrestling matches at In Your House 6 featured professional wrestlers performing as characters in scripted events pre- determined by the hosting promotion, World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Storylines between the characters played out on WWF's primary television programs, Monday Night Raw. At the 1995 Survivor Series Bret Hart defeated Diesel to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Diesel, who had been a face throughout his time as champion, began showing more and more heel tendencies both in his wrestling style and comments towards other wrestlers; at the 1996 Royal Rumble he attacked referee Earl Hebner during Hart's title match against The Undertaker, costing the latter his opportunity for the championship. After this, Bret Hart was scheduled to defend the championship against Diesel on In Your House 6. To prevent any outside interferences this match was placed inside a Steel cage. Another rivalry leading into the event was between Shawn Michaels and Owen Hart. In autumn 1995, Michaels took a hiatus from wrestling due to an injury sustained in a real-life attack. Michaels teased retirement but returned in January 1996 to win the 1996 Royal Rumble match, earning him a title opportunity at Wrestlemania XII. However, Owen Hart taunted Michaels, claiming credit for the injury, leading to a match at the event, in which Michaels put his title opportunity on the line. ==Event== During the main event Steel Cage match The Undertaker emerged inside the steel cage by breaking through the floor of the wrestling ring and attacked Diesel, dragging him through the hole in the floor to allow Bret Hart to climb over the top of the cage to win the match. After the matches shown live on pay-per-view, three untelevised dark matches were contested at the venue. ==Aftermath== As a result of his victory against Owen Hart, Shawn Michaels challenged Bret Hart for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in the main event of WrestleMania XII in an Iron Man match. Michaels won the match and his first WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Bret Hart took a six- month hiatus from wrestling. Following the Undertaker's interference in the Steel Cage match, he wrestled and defeated Diesel at WrestleMania XII. ==Results== ==Other on-screen personnel== {|border=\"0\" |valign=\"top\"| ;Commentators *Vince McMahon *Jerry Lawler ;Interviewers *Todd Pettengill *Dok Hendrix |valign=\"top\"| ;Ring announcer *Howard Finkel ;Referees *Tim White *Mike Chioda *Jack Doan *Earl Hebner |} ==References== 06 Category:Events in Louisville, Kentucky Category:1996 in Kentucky Category:Professional wrestling in Kentucky Category:1996 WWF pay-per-view events Category:February 1996 events in the United States ",
