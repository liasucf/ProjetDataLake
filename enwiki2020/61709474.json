    "text": "The Wha Ti First Nation is a T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb First Nations band government in the Northwest Territories. The band's main community is What\u00ec, known before 1996 as Lac La Martre and before 2005 as Wha Ti, where 635 of its 681 members live. In 2005, Wha Ti became part of the T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb Government, and collectively holds title to 39,000 square kilometers of T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb land. The new What\u00ec Community Government has assumed most of the band's powers and responsibilities. However, the federal government still recognizes Wha Ti for Indian Act enrollment purposes. ==References== Category:First Nations in the Northwest Territories Category:Dene governments ",
