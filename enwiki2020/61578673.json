    "text": "The 1910 New South Wales state election involved 90 electoral district returning one member each. This was the first NSW election using a second ballot system. All previous elections had used a first past the post voting system, where a candidate might be elected with less than 50% of the vote especially where two or more similar candidates split the vote. Under the second ballot system, if a candidate failed to achieve at least 50% of the vote in an electorate, a run-off election would take place in the following weeks. In this election, 3 electorates proceeded to second round elections. At Durham and St Leonards the second round ballot was won by the leading candidate; however, at Hastings and Macleay the support fom the Labour Party saw the independent overtake sitting Liberal Reform member to take the seat. The Labour Party fielded a candidate in every electorate, with the result that the only 3 uncontested seats, Broken Hill, Cobar and The Murray, were all held by the Labour Party. There were 15 seats that elected a member from a different party and a further 11 seats where the member retained the seat but changed party. For a comprehensive list, see . The election saw the final demise of the Progressive Party, with the four surviving members, Gordon McLaurin (Albury), George Briner (Raleigh), Robert Levien (Tamworth) and Robert Donaldson (Wynyard) retaining their seats having campaigned as Independent Liberals. == Election results == === Albury === | | | colspan=\"2\" | Member changed to Ind Liberal from Progressive (defunct) | style=\"text- align:right;\" | Swing | style=\"text-align:right;\" | -6.03 === Alexandria === === Allowrie === === Annandale === === Armidale === === Ashburnham === === Ashfield === === Balmain === === Bathurst === === Bega === === Belmore === *Edward O'Sullivan had won Belmore at the 1907 election as a Former Progressive; however, he joined the Labour Party in 1909 and died in April 1910.
