    "text": "Robert Dillon, 2nd Earl of Roscommon PC (Ire) (died 1642) became earl of Roscommon only a bit more than a year before his death. He was one of the keepers of the King's seal and, for a short time, a Lord Justice of Ireland. ==Birth and origins== Robert was born in Ireland, the eldest son of James Dillon and his wife Eleanor Barnewall. His father was the 1st Earl of Roscommon. His family was Old English and descended from Sir Henry Dillon who came to Ireland with Prince John in 1185. His family held substantial lands in Meath, Westmeath, Longford and Roscommon. Robert's mother, who was also called Helen, was a daughter of Christopher Barnewall of Turvey House, Dublin. Her family also was Old English. Robert was one of seven brothers and had six sisters. {| !align=\"left\"|Robert listed among his brothers |- |He heads the list of his brothers below as the eldest: #Robert (died 1642); #Lucas of Twomere, or of Trinity Island, County Cavan, from whom the 9th, 10th and 11th earls descended, married Mary, daughter of Sir John Thorpe; #Thomas, died unmarried; #Christopher, died unmarried; #George, died unmarried; #John, died unmarried; and #Patrick, from whom the 12th and last Earl descended, married Jame Malone, daughter of Baron Malone. |} {| !align=\"left\"|Robert's six sisters |- | #Jane, married in 1604 her distant cousin Sir Christopher Dillon, son of Theobald Dillon, 1st Viscount Dillon, #Elizabeth, married Hussey, Baron Galtrim; #Frances, married the playwright and politician Henry Burnell and had many children, including the poet Eleanor Burnell. #Margaret, married Nugent of Drumcree; # Mary, married sir John Bellew; and # Alison, married Roger O'Farrell of Morrin, chief of his name. |} ==Marriages and children== Dillon married three times and had five sons from his three wives. Nothing seems to be known about his daughters. ===First marriage=== In about 1600 Dillon married Margaret Barry. She was a daughter of David FitzDavid de Barry (died 1605), grand-daughter of David de Barry, 5th Viscount Buttevant and sister of David Barry, 1st Earl of Barrymore. His wife's family, the de Barrys, was Old English like his own. With Margaret he had: #James (c. 1605 \u2013 1649), became the 3rd Earl Roscommon; #Lucas, died childless; #David, died an infant. ===Second marriage=== He married secondly Dorothy, fourth daughter of George Hastings, 4th Earl of Huntingdon, widow of Sir James Steuart. With Dorothy he had: #Henry (died 1640), died unmarried. ===Third marriage=== He married thirdly Anne, dowager Baroness Folliott, daughter of Sir William Strode (or Stroud). With Anne he had: #Carey (1627\u20131689), became the 5th Earl Roscommon. ==Career== On 24 January 1620 his father was raised to the peerage with the title of Baron Dillon of Kilkenny-West, in the Peerage of Ireland. in a ceremony performed by the Lord Deputy Oliver St. John in the Presence Chamber of Dublin Castle on 25 January. On 5 August 1622 Robert's father was furthered honoured by being made Earl of Roscommon. In consequence of his fathers advancement, Robert, the heir apparent, was styled Lord Kilkenny-West, as a courtesy title from 1622 to 1641. His mother died on 11 October 1628. On 14 July 1634, his father took his seat in the Irish House of Lords. On 26 May 1638 a \"Robert Lord Dillon\" was appointed as one of the keepers of the King's seal. It seems that people found that Lord Kilkenny-West was a bit cumbersome as a title and called him Lord Dillon instead. Soon after Lord Deputy Christopher Wandesford's death on 3 December 1640 Charles I appointed Lord Dillon (i.e. Lord Kilkenny-West) together with Sir William Parsons Lords Justices for Ireland, but Dillon was considered to have been too closely associated with Strafford and was soon replaced. John Borlase was chosen as his successor. His father died in March 1641 and he succeeded as the 2nd Earl of Roscommon. ==Death and timeline== Lord Roscommon, as he was finally now, died on 27 August 1642 in Oxmantown, a quarter in Dublin's Northside. {| !colspan=3|Timeline |- !align=\"left\"|Age!!align=\"left\"|Date!!align=\"left\"|Event |- |0||1585, estimate||Born. |- |||1603, 24 Mar||Accession of King James I, replacing Queen Elizabeth I. |- |||1604, Nov||Sister Jane married Christopher Dillon of Ballylaghan, the heir apparent of Theobald Dillon, 1st Viscount Dillon. |- |||1605, about||Birth of his eldest son, James. |- |||1620, 24 Jan||Father created Baron of Kilkenny-West. |- |||1622, 5 Aug||Father elevated to Earl of Roscommon. |- |||1625, 27 Mar||Accession of King Charles I, replacing King James I. |- |||1628, 11 Oct||His mother died. |- |||1634, 14 Jul||His father took his seat in the Irish House of Lords. |- |||1638, 26 May||Appointed one of the Lord Keeper of the seal. |- |||1640, Dec||Appointed one of the Lord Justices of Ireland. |- |||1641, Mar||Succeeded his father as the 2nd Earl of Roscommon. |- |||1641, 12 May||Strafford beheaded. |- |||1642, 27 Aug||Died in Oxmantown, Dublin. |} ==Notes and references== * \u2013 1603 to 1642 * \u2013 Abdy to Hutchinson (for Dillon) * \u2013 Ibbetson to Zouche (for Roscommon) * (for Strafford) * \u2013 N to R (for Roscommon) * - Scotland and Ireland * \u2013 Viscounts (for Dillon) * (for his wife, Margaret Barry) * (for Table of reigns) * \u2013 From the Rebellion to the Cessation * ==External links== *Genealogy of Robert Dillon 2nd Earl of Roscommon on The Peerage website Category:1642 deaths Category:16th-century Irish people Category:17th-century Irish people Category:Earls of Roscommon Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland Category:Year of birth uncertain ",
