A monastery was present by 1123. Priests from the Order of Canons Regular of the Lateran were officiating by 1480. Reconstruction was commissioned in the early 17th century by the Girolamini order from the architect Pietro Fiorini, and construction proceeded from 1608 to 1618 for the church and the adjacent convent. The church has a single nave with four chapels. In 1797, the convent was suppressed and in 1806 the church was closed. All the artwork has been removed.Biblioteca Salaborsa, entry on church.
