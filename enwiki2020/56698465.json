    "text": "O Jogo (English: The Game) was a Brazilian reality show Broadcast on Rede Globo between May 27 and July 29, 2003, on Tuesday nights. It was a Brazilian version of the FOX Television show, Murder in Small Town X. == Premise == The plot of the program focused of the murder of businessman Wagner Klein, director of Paes Brasil School, in the fictional city of Santo Ant\u00f4nio. Was one of the Candidate's for mayor of the city, Wagner was married with Professor of Biology Priscila Klein, a woman unhappy with her marriage with him, and had a son, Maur\u00edcio Klein, mysterious young Man who despite relying on his fathers income, distanced himself from the family. After his mysterious murder, it was discovered that the director was also a man full of enemies - with at least 12 suspects who could have committed the crime. The murder, committed on the Klein family's boat, was recorded by the murderer himself who, without showing his identity, proposed a game, describing 12 suspects - one among them as him/her - and asking a question: \"Who am I?\". To unravel the mystery, 12 wannabe investigators, entered the fictional city to solve the mystery and claim the cash reward. Each week, the investigators were sent out on varying missions around the town in order to discover clues to clear suspects. Additionally, the murderer would strike again, clearing suspects as well. At the beginning of each episode, one investigator would be appointed as the Lead Investigator, who would have specific responsibilities and powers. The investigators would be split into teams by the Lead Investigator, and sent down different \"leads\". During the investigation, the team would be given a task by the killer to take out one of the innocent suspects for a chance to accumulate R$25,000 for every time they get the correct suspect for the day. Failing to do the task or giving the wrong answer would mean the money wasn't added to the total pot. A maximum potential was R$250,000 (Adjusted for 2020's value, R$652,764) for clearing all ten suspects correctly, however the team got two suspects wrong meaning the final pot was left at R$200,000 for solving the case. At some point during the investigation days in each episode the killer would leave some form of message, consisting of maps with the two locations attached, usually accompanied by the taunting words 'coming out to play?', Signaling the start of each episodes elimination, The Killers Game. Every investigator except the lead investigator could vote and the investigator with the most votes would be chosen as the first person to play the Killer's Game. The Lead Investigator would then choose any investigator to be the second person for the Killer's Game. The two chosen investigators pick from two envelopes to decide who will go to either of the two locations given. In the finale episode, two killer games were played. In the Killer's Game, the two selected investigators would be sent to two different remote locations completely alone, with their movements recorded only by a head-mounted camera and a flashlight, they also had to follow a map to where the \"clue\" would be located. One of the chosen investigators would discover an important clue that would help solve the mystery, whereas the other investigator would be eliminated from the show as \"murdered by the killer\". The eliminated contestant would choose the Lead Investigator for the next episode, by means of a prerecorded \"last will and testament\". == The Investigators == The following list are the contestants that took part in the show, in the order of Elimination. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Investigator !Job !Eliminated !Final Killer's Game Location |- |Tatiana |align=\"center\"|Columnist |align=\"center\"|12th Place |align=\"center\"|Unknown |- |Marcelo |align=\"center\"|Scientist |align=\"center\"|11th Place |align=\"center\"|Unknown |- |Fernanda |align=\"center\"|Business Student |align=\"center\"|10th Place |align=\"center\"|Unknown |- |Sidney |align=\"center\"|Administrator |align=\"center\"|9th Place |align=\"center\"|Unknown |- |Rebeca |align=\"center\"|Interior Design Student |align=\"center\"|8th Place |align=\"center\"|Unknown |- |Marco |align=\"center\"|Street Artist / Circus Musician |align=\"center\"|7th Place |align=\"center\"|Unknown |- |Henrique |align=\"center\"|Architect |align=\"center\"|6th Place |align=\"center\"|Unknown |- |Ant\u00f4nio |align=\"center\"|Writer |align=\"center\"|5th Place |align=\"center\"|Unknown |- |Joana |align=\"center\"|Film Student / Director |align=\"center\"|4th Place |align=\"center\"|Unknown |- |Priscila |align=\"center\"|Beauty Salon Owner |align=\"center\"|3rd Place |align=\"center\"|Unknown |- |Breno |align=\"center\"|Student / Lawyer |align=\"center\"|Runner Up |align=\"center\"|Unknown |- |Elaine |align=\"center\"|Former Advertising Agent |align=\"center\"|Winner |align=\"center\"|The Chapel |- |} == The Suspects == The Following list are the suspects that the investigators had to figure out who the murder was. {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Suspect !Job !Outcome !Notes |- |Petr\u00f4nio Lav\u00ednio (Pep\u00ea) |align=\"center\"|Village Hermit |align=\"center\"|Unknown |align=\"center\"| |- |Telma Werner |align=\"center\"|Newspaper Journalist |align=\"center\"|Unknown |align=\"center\"| |- |Otto Ventura |align=\"center\"|Psychiatrist |align=\"center\"|Unknown |align=\"center\"| |- |Belisa Hoffman |align=\"center\"|Village Mayor |align=\"center\"|Unknown |align=\"center\"| |- |L\u00facio |align=\"center\"|Fisherman |align=\"center\"|Unknown |align=\"center\"| |- |Cida |align=\"center\"|The Village Mystic |align=\"center\"|Unknown |align=\"center\"| |- |Alice Erthal |align=\"center\"|Ex Wife to Maur\u00edco |align=\"center\"|Unknown |align=\"center\"| |- |Silv\u00e9rio Santar\u00e9m (Br\u00f3der) |align=\"center\"|Bar Owner |align=\"center\"|Unknown |align=\"center\"| |- |Rodolfo Muller |align=\"center\"|Rival Businessman |align=\"center\"|Unknown |align=\"center\"| |- |Oscar Acioly |align=\"center\"|Chief of Police |align=\"center\"|Cleared |align=\"center\"| |- |Tadeu Reigel |align=\"center\"|Village Dentist |align=\"center\"|11th Cleared |align=\"center\"| |- |Maria Ritinha |align=\"center\"|Social Worker |align=\"center\"| The Murderer |align=\"center\"| |- |} == Winning Moment == In the final event of the show, Both Breno and Elaine were the last two investigators left in the show.
