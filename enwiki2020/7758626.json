    "text": "Black Hearts in Battersea is a children's novel by Joan Aiken first published in 1964. The second book in the Wolves Chronicles, it is loosely a sequel to her earlier Wolves of Willoughby Chase. The book is set in a slightly altered historical England\u2014during the reign of King James III\u2014in the early 19th century, and follows the adventures of Simon, an orphan whose plans to study painting in London are derailed by high adventure. Aiken was inspired to create an atmosphere of important events having already transpired offstage (which was helped by the fact that a great deal of the beginning had to be left out due to length), and also included an involved \"Dickensian plot\" which she believed to complement the habit many children have of rereading or having a book reread to them. ==TV adaptation== In 1995, the book was adapted by James Andrew Hall into a television series by James Andrew Hall, airing on BBC1 from 31 December 1995 to 11 February 1996.Black Hearts in Battersea at IMDb ===Cast list=== * Mark Burdis as Scrimshaw * Jade Williams as Dido * Roger Bizley as Captain Dark * Annette Badland as Dolly Buckle * John Altman as Midwink * Gemma Sealey as Sophie * William Mannering as Simon * Richard Woods as Boy with Wheelbarrow ==Radio adaptation== A BBC Radio dramatisation by Lin Coghlan, directed by Marc Beeby, of Joan Aiken's classic children's adventure.
