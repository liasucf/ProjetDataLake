He formerly served as a city councilman in Wasilla. Wilson was elected to the Senate at the age of 35. He narrowly defeated Representative Lynn Gattis in the Republican primary to succeed longtime Senator Charlie Huggins, who was retiring, in August 2016. He was endorsed in his campaign by the conservative Republican Assembly but did not run with the backing of the Alaska Republican Party. He was previously an unaffiliated voter, registering with the Republican Party less than a year before his primary victory. Upon being sworn in on January 17, 2017, Wilson became the first African-American elected to the Senate from Alaska's Matanuska-Susitna Valley, Wilson is the eighth African-American to serve in the Alaska Legislature. Of those eight, he is the third Republican, the second senator, the first Republican senator and the first to represent an area of Alaska outside of Anchorage or Fairbanks. == Slapping Incident == On May 2, 2017, Wilson allegedly slapped Nathaniel Herz of the Alaska Dispatch News during an encounter in the Alaska State Capitol in Juneau. The event was recorded by Herz's smartphone as the reporter was questioning Wilson on his reaction to a recent article about a bill proposed by Wilson. Herz filed a police report that day. On December 12, 2017, The Alaska Office of Special Prosecutions declined to pursue charges against Wasilla Republican Sen. David Wilson for a May incident in which he allegedly slapped Anchorage Daily News reporter Nathaniel Herz. In a letter Tuesday to Juneau police, Chief Assistant Attorney General Andrew Peterson wrote that it is unlikely the state will be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Wilson acted with the specific intent to harass or annoy Herz, the standard for determining harassment in the second degree. == Harassment and Retaliation charges == Wilson was cleared of sexual harassment claims by a female legislative aide who claimed he placed a cell phone near her legs. He was, however, found responsible for retaliatory actions against the person who made the complaint by talking about it. Senate President Pete Kelly ordered that Wilson be given a probationary period, during which he would be restricted in travel, demonstrate he knows proper decorum and understands retaliation.

He attended Alaska Pacific University, earning a degree in psychology, where he met his wife, Aleta. ==See also== * Black conservatism in the United States * List of African-American Republicans * List of first African-American U.S. state legislators ==References== Category:1980s births Category:African-American Christians Category:African-American state legislators in Alaska Category:Alaska city council members Category:Alaska Pacific University alumni Category:Alaska Republicans Category:Alaska state senators Category:Living people Category:People from California Category:People from Wasilla, Alaska Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
