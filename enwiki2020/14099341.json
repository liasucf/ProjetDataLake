    "text": "Black Squirrel Radio (BSR) is a non-commercial internet radio station run by students of Kent State University, broadcasting exclusively online. Black Squirrel Radio is overseen by faculty from Kent State University's Journalism and Mass Communication program. ==History== Established on October 2, 1950, the university's WKSU-FM (88.1) originally served as an outlet for Kent State students to broadcast; prior to 1950, the university's Radio Workshop program produced original programming for WADC from 1940 to 1943, and on WAKR from 1945 to 1950. In January 1965, an unlicensed carrier current radio station was activated bearing the unofficial \"WKSU\" call sign. Students were given more responsibility at this station than at WKSU-FM, but by 1970, \"WKSU\" had ceased operations. Some students continued on with WKSU-FM, though all were eventually replaced with professionals when WKSU-FM became an affiliate of National Public Radio (NPR) in 1974. The same students dismissed from WKSU-FM chose to revive WKSU-AM as WKSR. The closed-circuit station's reach was limited to on campus; throughout the 1970s, 80s, and the early 90s, WKSR was often referred to as \"roommate radio.\" In 1999, WKSR began streaming over a Kent State campus cable channel. In the fall of 2005, WKSR began broadcasting online. The new internet radio station soon adopted the name \"Black Squirrel Radio\"; the WKSR \"call letters\" were never assigned by the FCC to the Kent State student-run station, but rather to WKSR-FM, a radio station licensed to Loretto, Tennessee. Since the name change, Black Squirrel Radio has been expanding the breadth of their content to include podcasting and talk radio shows in addition to music shows. Black Squirrel Radio currently has over 120 students on its staff. Black Squirrel Radio now calls Franklin Hall its home. The station was formerly located in the Music & Speech Building. ==Programming== Urban contemporary, Rock music and \"Local music\" all account for the programming on the station. Black Squirrel Radio's mascot, \"URL the Squirrel\", is an acronym for \"Urban-Rock-Local\", in addition to the Uniform Resource Locator, a pun alluding to the station's exclusive online format. BSR is an affiliate of UWIRE,http://uwire.com/affiliates/ which gathers, edits, and re-distributes student-created content,http://uwire.com/about/ and broadcasts news at 15 minutes before the hour and at 15 minutes past the hour. ==References== ==External links== * *KentWired.com Category:Kent State University Category:College radio stations in Ohio Category:Radio stations in Akron, Ohio Category:2005 establishments in Ohio Category:Internet radio stations in the United States ",
