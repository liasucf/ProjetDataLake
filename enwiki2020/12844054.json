At 110 acres it is the third largest cemetery in the United Kingdom. ==History== Monument to Frank Baselow The cemetery was opened in 1859 and originally had two chapels: one Anglican and the other non-conformist, and each including its own porte-coch\u00e8re. The cemetery has a Roman Catholic section, where a Roman Catholic chapel was built later. In the Second World War, air raids damaged Cathays Cemetery with a number of bombs and an aerial mine. In the 20th century all three chapels were neglected and in the 1980s the Roman Catholic one was demolished. Since 2008 the Anglican and non-conformist chapels have been undergoing restoration. The chapels, as well as the cemetery gateway and forecourt walls, are Grade II listed buildings. During the early/mid 1970s the cemetery was split into two sections to allow the building of the A48 Eastern Avenue which was a continuation of the A48(M). One of the most imposing memorials is that of Frank Baselow, thought to be a result of Baselow's European heritage (his actual name was Franz) and the taste on the Continent for grand memorials. ===War graves=== Commonwealth War Graves section The cemetery has a Commonwealth War Graves (CWGC) section, marked by a Cross of Sacrifice made to the standard design devised by Reginald Blomfield. The section was established in the First World War, when Cardiff's nearby main hospitals treated numerous servicemen who had been wounded in action, or who contracted influenza in the 1918\u201319 influenza pandemic. The war graves section includes a number of graves of Australian and Canadian servicemen, one New Zealander who died while serving in the Royal Defence Corps, and one soldier of the Prince of Wales's Leinster Regiment. Also present is the grave of Jacques Vaillant de Gu\u00e9lis, a Special Operations Executive agent. The cemetery includes the graves of 21 French Navy sailors from the First World War, mostly are in the Roman Catholic section, and a similar number of Norwegian sailors from the Second. Elsewhere in the cemetery are numerous other Commonwealth War Graves from both the First and Second World Wars. The cemetery contains in all the graves of 685 service personnel that are registered and maintained by the CWGC. ==Notable interments== *Robert Bird, Liberal Party politician *Sir James Cory, 1st Baronet, shipowner and Conservative Party politician *Jim Driscoll, boxer *John Emlyn-Jones, shipowner and Liberal politician *John Humphrey England, founder of Edward England Potatoes. *John Cuthbert Hedley, Roman Catholic bishop *Archibald Hood, colliery owner *Thomas Rowland Hughes, writer *Hilary Marquand, Labour Party politician *Sir William Henry Seager, shipowner and Liberal politician *Frances Batty Shand, founder of Cardiff Institute for the Blind *Sir William Reardon Smith, 1st Baronet, shipowner *William Tatem, 1st Baron Glanely, shipowner *Sir Tudor Thomas, ophthalmic surgeon *Alfred Thomas, 1st Baron Pontypridd, Liberal politician *Maurice Turnbull, Glamorgan and England cricketer *Ernest Willows, aviation pioneer and airship builder *Several Senghenydd Colliery Disaster victims ==Notes== ==Sources and further reading== * * ==External links== *The Friends of Cathays Cemetery * * * \u2014 photographs * \u2014 photographs Category:1859 establishments in Wales Category:Cathays Category:Cemeteries in Cardiff Category:Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries in Wales ",
