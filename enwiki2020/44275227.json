    "text": "The Western Crusaders (Foxes) are a women's gridiron team based in Footscray, which is west of Melbourne, in Victoria, Australia. They were the first women's gridiron team established in Victoria and are affiliated with the Western Crusaders Gridiron Football Club. ==History== The Western Foxes became the first full kit women's gridiron team in Victoria in 2012, growing from a handful of players in the early stages of the year to a fully fledged squad within months. In October 2012, the Foxes made history by playing the first ever game of women's gridiron in the state, with an intra-club scrimmage that saw the offensive team take on the defensive unit. The team played four scrimmages in the latter stages of 2012 before playing representative teams from both Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory in March 2013. Women's gridiron continued to grow at a rapid rate, which resulted in the creation of two new teams in Victoria: the Northern Lady Raiders and the Melbourne Uni Chargers. These three teams competed for the inaugural women's championship in 2013, with the Foxes progressing through the season undefeated to claim the inaugural Women's Vic Bowl title. The Vic Bowl MVP was Foxes #89, Jaz Drewry. The Crusaders went on to win back to back VicBowls in 2014 Gridiron Victoria women's competition. In 2017, they plan to re-form the team in order to gain entry into the 2017 Competition. ==2013 Players== ===Playing Squad=== ==See also== Gridiron Victoria ==References== ==External links== * Western Crusaders Official Website Category:American football teams in Victoria (Australia) Category:Women's American football teams Category:American football teams established in 2012 Category:2012 establishments in Australia Category:Women's sports teams in Australia ",
