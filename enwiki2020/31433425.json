    "text": "The 800 class were a class of diesel locomotives built by English Electric, Rocklea for the South Australian Railways in 1956/57. They were nearly identical to the earlier Jamaican Railways 81 class. ==History== The 800 class were diesel shunter locomotives operated by the South Australian Railways. Although built for shunting duties in Adelaide, they also operated trip workings between Dry Creek and Mile End, pick up trains around Port Adelaide and passenger services. In March 1978 all were included in the transfer of the South Australian Railways to Australian National. In 1986, a new computer system required the class leaders of the former South Australian Railways to be renumbered as the last member of the class, with 800 becoming 810.\"Australian National Broken Hill Line Report\" Railway Digest October 1986 page 314 They were withdrawn in the early 1990s.Broad Gauge 800-class diesel locomotives Chris's Commonwealth Railways Pages800 Class Railpage800 Class Rail SA800 Class Vicsig One has been preserved by the National Railway Museum, Port Adelaide.801 National Railway Museum ==Model railways== ===HO Scale=== SDS Models in 2019 announced a range of 800 class locomotives, The Range will Have Tangerine 800 and 807.
