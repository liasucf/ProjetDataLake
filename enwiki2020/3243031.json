The corporation regulates visual and audio broadcasting in the Kingdom of Bahrain. It broadcasts programs in both Arabic and English. ==Radio Bahrain== Radio Bahrain was established in 1955, was taken over by BRTC in 1971, and became an independent body in 1993. Its English-language radio service has been on-air since 1977, broadcasting four hours a day from a studio in Isa Town. In 1982 the station was moved to a building in Adliya. On- air time was extended to 18 hours a day. A second station, Radio 2, began broadcasting 6 hours a day. In 1989 a new studio was established in the Ministry of Information building, and the following year the station went 24 hours. In 2007 Radio Bahrain switched its frequency from 101.0FM to 99.5FM. ==Bahrain TV== Bahrain TV was formed in 1973 and has produced many Bahraini- created and produced shows, the most prominent being youth shows such as Chat with Batelco, and Hala Bahrain.
