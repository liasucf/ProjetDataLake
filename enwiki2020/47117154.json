    "text": "Pump-handle is a movement of the ribs that results in a change in the anteroposterior diameter of the thorax.https://www.dartmouth.edu/~humananatomy/part_4/chapter_20.html ==Definition== One of the most important functions of the ribs and diaphragm is the change in volume of the thorax that helps inspiration and expiration.Drake, Richard L.; Vogl, Wayne; Tibbitts, Adam W.M. Mitchell; illustrations by Richard; Richardson, Paul (2005). Gray's anatomy for students. Philadelphia: Elsevier/Churchill Livingstone. . In general, the ribs move around two axes. The anterior end of the rib is lower than the posterior end; therefore, during elevation of the rib, the anterior end also moves forwards. Movement at costovertebral joints 2 to 6 about a side-to-side axis results in raising and lowering the sternal end of the rib, the \"pump-handle\" movement. This occurs mostly in the vertebrosternal ribs. In elevation, this increases the anteroposterior diameter of the thorax.http://www.dartmouth.edu/~humananatomy/figures/chapter_20/20-7.HTM ==See also== * Bucket handle movement ==References== *http://www.duhs.edu.pk ==External links== * Category:Thorax (human anatomy) Category:Respiration ",
