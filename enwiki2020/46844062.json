The semifinals and championship game were played again at the UNCG Soccer Stadium in Greensboro, North Carolina during December 1998. Florida defeated North Carolina in the final, 1\u20130, to win their first national title. Coached by Becky Burleigh, the Gators finished the season 26\u20131. Florida won the championship in just their first appearance in the College Cup, a feat matched only by USC in 2007. The Most Outstanding Offensive Player was Danielle Fotopoulos from Florida, and the Most Outstanding Defensive Player was Meredith Flaherty, also from Florida. Fotopoulos and Flaherty, along with ten other players, were named to the All-tournament team. The tournament's leading scorer, with 3 goals, was Meredith Florance from North Carolina. ==Qualification== All Division I women's soccer programs were eligible to qualify for the tournament.
