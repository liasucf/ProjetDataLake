The three-story brick building was built in 1927. Architects McNally and Quinn designed the Tudor Revival building. The building's design features arched entrances, projecting bays, limestone window moldings, decorative gargoyles, and a parapet with several gables. The Tudor design continues in the building's interior, which includes wood panels in its lobby, wrought iron balustrades on its staircases, and marble fireplaces in the apartments themselves. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 15, 1984. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Cook County, Illinois Category:Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Buildings and structures in Evanston, Illinois Category:Apartment buildings in Illinois Category:Tudor Revival architecture in Illinois Category:Residential buildings completed in 1927 ",
