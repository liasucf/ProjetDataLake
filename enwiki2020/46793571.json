    "text": "The research project SCALARE (SCALing softwARE) is a European ITEA 2 project. The aim of the international project SCALARE is to develop a Scaling Management Framework (SMF). The SMF is envisaged to be a roadmap for all organizations to guide them in growing their software delivery capacity. The key motivation for the project is the observation that all companies are becoming increasingly dependent on software, in particular traditional hardware-focused companies. The project partners all encounter different types of challenges in scaling up their capacity to deliver software. The project aims to identify these challenges, identify the common approaches taken and offered in the scientific software engineering literature and to offer a systematic approach to implement these approaches. ;Project data :Supporting organisations: ITEA2, Enterprise Ireland, VINNOVA :Duration: 01.12.2013 - 1.12.2016 ==General information== The main objective of SCALARE is to support the software industry in scaling their software delivery capacity. The term scaling is used not only in the traditional sense, namely the size of software systems expressed in lines of code, but also to scale in two other dimensions: the processes and methods used to deliver software systems, and the organizations that deliver software. ===Technical and Scientific Objectives of SCALARE=== # Establishment of Software scaling as a multi-dimensional phenomenon. # Develop a pattern language for Scaling Software. # Study how scaling software happens in practice through industry case studies. # Demonstrate the use of the SCALARE pattern language and the Scaling Management Framework. # Support organizations to grow their software delivery capacity. ===Participants=== *Aalto University *Addalot *Tieto Sweden *Kugler-Maag Cie *QUMAS *Goshido *Lero, the Irish Software Research Centre *Telvent *Husqvarna *Lund University *Sigrun *Softhouse *Sony Mobile ===Work Packages and Tasks=== *WP 1: Scaling Management Framework *WP 2: Scaling Products, Systems and Services *WP 3: Scaling Organizations and Business Domains *WP 4: Scaling Processes and Methods *WP 5: Project Management and Dissemination == Main results == === The Scaling Management Framework === One of the main results of the project is the definition of a Scaling Management Framework. It is a model that addresses the questions and challenges organizations face when they need to transform their software development in order to meet new business requirements. The SMF consists of the following main parts: * Business drivers * Current abilities * Software model * Wanted abilities Scaling is affected by the business drivers for the organization and the development. The current abilities of the organization is described in terms of observable characteristics, like lead time, quality and effort. The wanted abilities are defined based on the business drivers and the current abilities. The software model describes the development in terms of the product view, the organization view, and the process view. A main feature of the SMF is that transformations always are analysed with respect to all these dimensions. ==External links== *SCALARE project website *SCALARE project at ITEA website *ITEA 2 website *Eureka *Enterprise Ireland website *VINNOVA website == Project Publications == # U.
