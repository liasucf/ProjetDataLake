    "text": "The Armagh county football team represents County Armagh, Northern Ireland, in men's Gaelic football and is governed by Armagh GAA, the County Board of the Gaelic Athletic Association. The team competes in the three major annual inter-county competitions; the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, the Ulster Senior Football Championship and the National Football League. Armagh's home ground is the Athletic Grounds, Armagh. The team's manager is Kieran McGeeney. The team last won the Ulster Senior Championship in 2008, the All- Ireland Senior Championship in 2002 and the National League in 2005. ==History== Antrim manager Liam Bradley (left) at the launch of the 2009 Dr McKenna Cup Armagh became only the second team to win the Ulster Senior Football Championship in 1890. In the early years of the GAA, a club that won its county championship went on to represent the county and would also wear the county colours. Armagh Harps represented Armagh in the Ulster final, beating Tyrone (Cookstown's Owen Roes), but losing to All-Ireland Champions Cork (Midleton) in the All-Ireland Semi-Final. Despite early success at provincial level, national success at junior and minor level and All-Ireland final appearances in 1953 and 1977, it took until 2002 for Armagh to win their first and only All-Ireland Senior Football Championship under manager Joe Kernan. The county won the All-Ireland Minor Football Championship, in 1949 and again in 2009, but lost the 1957 All-Ireland Minor final to Meath. After a disappointing 2009 campaign which resulted in Armagh being defeated by Tyrone, Peter McDonnell stepped down as Armagh manager. He was replaced by Paddy O'Rourke, who is from the neighbouring county of Down. Paddy O'Rourke was replaced by Paul Grimley who managed Armagh for the 2013 and 2014 seasons. In 2015 Kieran McGeeney took over as manager in a five-year contract that was extended by a year in 2019 to 2020. ===The Era of the Two Brians (1995 - 2001)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! !! style=\"background:orange\"|NFL !! ! style=\"background:orange\"|Provincial !! ! style=\"background:orange\"|All Ireland !!! style=\"background:orange\"| Total |- | style=\"background:orange\"|Games Played || 38 || 13 || 5 || 56 |- | style=\"background:orange\"|Games Won || 18 || 7 || 2 || 27 |- | style=\"background:orange\"|Percentage Won || 47.37% || 53.85% || 40.00% || 48.22% |} ===Joe Kernan's Golden Era (2002 - 2006) === Joe Kernan is widely regarded as Armagh's most successful manager having won one League title, four Ulster Championships and one All Ireland Championship. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! !! style=\"background:orange\"|NFL !! style=\"background:orange\"|Provincial !! style=\"background:orange\"|All Ireland !! style=\"background:orange\"|Total |- | style=\"background:orange\"|Games Played || 38 || 18 || 14 || 70 |- | style=\"background:orange\"|Games Won || 23 || 14 || 10 || 47 |- | style=\"background:orange\"|Percentage Won || 60.53% || 77.77% || 71.43% || 67.14% |} ===Peter McDonnell Era (2007 - 2009)=== Peter McDonnell was appointed Armagh managed for the 2007\u20132009 seasons.

In his first season as Armagh manager, McGeeney secured promotion to division 2 of the National Football League after beating Fermanagh in the final. In his first Ulster championship game as manager, Armagh were defeated by Donegal on a scoreline of 0\u20138 to 2-11. Armagh's championship continued through the qualifiers where they managed a win over Wicklow but were then defeated by Galway in round 2. The 2016 NFL campaign ended with four teams finishing on the same points but by virtue of having a poor scoring difference Armagh were relegated to division 3. In the 2016 Ulster championship, Armagh suffered a defeat at the hands of Cavan forcing Armagh to continue their championship through the backdoor which resulted in a defeat to Laois in round 1. Armagh's 2017 NFL campaign ended with Tipperary beating Armagh in the last league game, this resulted in Armagh missing out on promotion back to division 2. In the Ulster championship Armagh went out to neighbours Down. However, Armagh recovered with wins over Fermanagh, Westmeath, Tipperary and Kildare to book a place in the All Ireland quarter finals where they were defeated by rivals Tyrone. Armagh started the 2018 season with promotion to division 2 but their Ulster championship ended with a loss to Fermanagh in the quarter final. Armagh continued their championship in round 1 of the qualifiers where they beat Westmeath, Sligo and Clare GAA but were unable to overcome Connacht finalists Roscommon. The 2019 campaign started off with Armagh securing their division 2 status. Armagh's 2019 Ulster championships started off with a quarter final win against neighbours Down which would mark Kieran McGeeney's first win in Ulster as manager of Armagh. In the quarter final Cavan and Armagh were inseparable in the first game but Cavan took the victory in the replay. In the qualifiers Armagh were pitted against Monaghan winning the game 2\u201317 to 1-12. In round 3 of the qualifiers Armagh were drawn against Mayo who would eventually defeat the Orchard county by a point. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! !! style=\"background:orange\"|NFL !! ! style=\"background:orange\"|Provincial !! ! style=\"background:orange\"|All Ireland !! style=\"background:orange\"|Total |- | style=\"background:orange\"|Games Played || 40 || 6 || 14 || 61 |- | style=\"background:orange\"|Games Won || 23 || 1 || 9 || 34 |- | style=\"background:orange\"|Percentage won || 57.5% || 16.66% || 64.29% || 55.74% |}[As of 8 March 2020] ==Honours== All-Ireland Senior Football Championships: 1 {|class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"background:orange\"| Year ! style=\"background:orange\"| Squadhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/northern_ireland/2270744.stm ! style=\"background:orange\"| Scoreline |- | 2002 | Benny Tierney, Enda McNulty, Justin McNulty, Francis Bellew, Aidan O'Rourke, Kieran McGeeney, A.
