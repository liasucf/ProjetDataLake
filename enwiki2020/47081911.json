    "text": "Wild Heart of the Young is the third album by singer/songwriter Karla Bonoff. The album includes Bonoff's only Top 40 hit, \"Personally\", which peaked at No. 19 on the Billboard singles chart.Whitburn, Joel (2000). The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, 7th Edition, p. 76. Billboard Books, New York. It is unusual in that it was not written by Bonoff. ==Track listing== All songs written by Karla Bonoff, except where noted. ==Reception== Rolling Stone's Stephen Holden notes that with this album Bonoff \"has finally stopped playing the role of the passive loser\u2026\" and \"strengthened her style to the point that she no longer sounds like an all-too-willing victim of love.\" He relates that \"[i]n her finest performance, she turns Paul Kelly's \"Personally,\"\u2026 into a sly tour de force of sexual tease.\" And concludes of the album that \"at its best it says goodbye to the smoggy, posh romanticism of Seventies L.A. with a confident kick of the heels.\" AllMusic's William Ruhlmann retrospectively describes \"Personally\" as \"a coy and catchy pop song utterly uncharacteristic of Bonoff's other work.\" He opines that \"Bonoff's original songs, which made up the bulk of the album, simply were not up to the standard set by her debut, and Wild Heart Of The Young was the weakest of her three Columbia Records albums.\" ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1982) !Peak position |- |US Billboard 200http://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/1982-11-20 |align=\"center\"|49 |- |} ===Year End Charts=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
