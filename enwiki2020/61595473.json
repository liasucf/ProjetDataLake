    "text": "The 1960 Formula Two season was the last season of 1.5 litre Formula Two racing which was to become Formula One for 1961. Two championships were held over the same five events, the Formula Two Constructors' Championship and the Formula Two Drivers' Championship, in addition to many non-championship Formula Two events. The Constructors' Championship was won in a draw by Cooper-Climax and Porsche, while the Drivers' Championship was won by Jack Brabham. ==Championship Schedule== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%\" |- !

Although it didn't appear in any championship events, Ferrari's first mid/rear-engined racing car, the Ferrari 156, appeared in non- championship events, notably winning the Solitude Grand Prix against strong opposition from Porsche. ===Race by race=== ====Race 1: Syracuse Grand Prix==== Ferrari entered the Syracuse Grand Prix with a heavily revised version of their 1959 cars for Wolfgang von Trips. Team Lotus entered two cars, one of which was the new Lotus 18 making its European debut driven by Innes Ireland. Neither the factory Coopers nor the factory Porsches were entered, however many private Coopers appeared, notably including factory driver Jack Brabham self entered in an older car, Equipe Nationale Belge and Yeoman Credit Racing entered two Coopers each, and Maurice Trintignant also self entered a Cooper. Porsche were represented by just a single entry from Rob Walker Racing Team for Stirling Moss. In practice, Moss established the fastest time, followed by Innes Ireland and Olivier Gendebien in one of the Equipe Nationale Belge Coopers who joined Moss on the front row. von Trips was not considered a serious contender for the win and qualified in seventh. In the race Moss lead from the start, building up a sizeable lead. Surprisingly, and to the Italian crowd's pleasure, von Trips was in second place by the end of the first lap, followed closely by Ireland and the Coopers, lead by Brabham. Brabham was able to push up into second place, with Ireland third and von Trips fourth, before Brabham was first overtaken by Ireland then forced to retire. Light rain arrived around lap 23, which favoured the Ferrari, allowing von Trips into second. Soon after Moss suffered an engine failure which caused him to retire, handing the lead to von Trips. Trintignant's private Cooper finished second, and Gendebien third, with Ireland finishing fourth due to minor engine trouble. ====Race 2: Brussels Grand Prix==== The Brussels Grand Prix was held over two heats, with overall positions determined by adding the two finishing positions in the heats, with ties decided by number of laps completed. Wolfgand von Trips, although entered in a Ferrari, did not appear, whilst the Lotuses were quite uncompetitive, so the racing was between the Rob Walker Porsche of Stirling Moss and the various different Coopers. The first heat, held in the dry, was won by Moss from Brabham and Trintignant. The second heat, held in wet conditions at the start, which did not suit the Porsche, was won by Brabham from Trintignant and Moss. This gave the overall win to Brabahm, from Moss and Trintignant. ====Race 3: Pau Grand Prix==== ====Race 4: Aintree 200==== In Aintree, Moss and Porsche were able to make up for their bad luck in earlier races and finally gain a championship win, locking out the podium. Moss made a poor start from pole, with the lead going to Brabham for much of the race, followed initially by Roy Salvadori (in a private Cooper), who was soon overtaken by Innes Ireland in a Lotus. Ireland would however misjudge his braking point at Tatts corner, taking some time to get going again. So then for the next several laps Brabham lead Salvadori, followed quite some distance back by Graham Hill in one of the factory Porsches. The battle for third place was fierce, with eventually Moss in his Rob Walker Porsche pulling away from the factory Porsches, and the Lotuses struggling. On lap 26, however, first Brabham, and then Salvadori came into the pits, both with engine trouble, giving the lead to Moss. Moss lead to the finish, although Jo Bonnier in the other factory Porsche came within a few seconds of him by the end of the race, with Hill in third and John Surtees in fourth in the first of the Coopers. ====Race 5: German Grand Prix==== == Formula Two Constructors' Championship final standings == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\" |- !
