All the courses are valid in the country and also, UGC has announced a \u201cCredit Framework for Online Learning Courses through SWAYAM\u201d Regulations, 2016 in the Gazette of India on July 19, 2016 where credit transfer for SWAYAM courses is defined. The UGC regulation requires Universities to make changes in their rules and regulation to incorporate provision for credit mobility and MOOC courses under the SWAYAM platform. The certificates of degrees and diploma will be given on clearing the criteria of course taken and that certificate will be a credit mobility for academic credits. The current guideline of UGC constrains just 20 percent of the courses for a degree-level program. == Local chapter == NPTEL is a joint initiative of the IITs and IISC, NPTEL offers online courses and certification in various fields.

Further under the SWAYAM-NPTEL webpage, two more departments are operated, i.e. NPTEL news and SWAYAM-NPTEL Local chapter news. NPTEL news highlights bulletins about SPOC timeline, list of active local chapters, local chapter\u2019s ratings, etc. And other department shows news from local chapters i.e. local chapter colleges/universities. == SWAYAM PRABHA== SWAYAM PRABHA is an education learning platform initiated by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) available 24x7 through 34 (initialy 32) DTH channels.
