    "text": "|} This is a list of electoral district results for the 1926 Queensland state election. At the time, the voting system in Queensland was based on contingency voting, which was similar to the modern optional preferential voting system. In electorates with 3 or more candidates, preferences were not distributed if a candidate received more than 50% of the primary vote. If none received more than 50%, all except the top two candidates were eliminated from the count and their preferences distributed between the two leaders, with the one receiving the most votes declared the winner. == Results by electoral district == === Albert === === Aubigny === === Balonne === ==== By-election ==== * This by-election was caused by the death of Edward Land.
