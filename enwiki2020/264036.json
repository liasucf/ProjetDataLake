    "text": "Peter K\u00fcrten (; 26 May 1883 \u2013 2 July 1931) was a German serial killer known as \"The Vampire of D\u00fcsseldorf\" and the \"D\u00fcsseldorf Monster\". He committed a series of murders and sexual assaults between February and November 1929 in the city of D\u00fcsseldorf. In the years before these assaults and murders, K\u00fcrten had amassed a lengthy criminal record for offences including arson and attempted murder. He also confessed to the 1913 murders of a nine-year-old girl in M\u00fclheim am Rhein and a 17-year-old girl in D\u00fcsseldorf. Described by as \"the king of the sexual perverts,\" K\u00fcrten was found guilty of nine counts of murder and seven counts of attempted murder for which he was sentenced to death by beheading in April 1931. He was executed in July 1931 at age 48. K\u00fcrten became known as the \"Vampire of D\u00fcsseldorf\" because he occasionally made attempts to drink the blood from his victims' wounds, and the \"D\u00fcsseldorf Monster\" both because the majority of his murders were committed in and around the city of D\u00fcsseldorf, and the savagery he inflicted upon his victims' bodies. ==Early life== ===Childhood=== Peter K\u00fcrten was born into a poverty- stricken, abusive family in M\u00fclheim am Rhein on 26 May 1883, the third of 13 children (two of whom died at an early age). K\u00fcrten's parents were both alcoholics who lived in a one-bedroom apartment, and K\u00fcrten's father frequently beat his wife and children, particularly when he was drunk. When intoxicated, K\u00fcrten's father often forced his wife and children to assemble before him before ordering his wife to strip naked and engage in intercourse with him as his children watched.The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers p. 151 He was jailed for 15 months in 1894 for committing incest with his eldest daughter, who was aged 13.Crimes of Horror p. 138 Shortly thereafter, K\u00fcrten's mother obtained a separation order, and later remarried and relocated to D\u00fcsseldorf.World Famous Murders pp. 393-394 In 1888, K\u00fcrten attempted to drown one of his playmates. Four years later, he befriended a local dog-catcher who lived in the same building as his family, and began accompanying him on his rounds. This individual often tortured and killed the animals he caught, and K\u00fcrten soon became an active and willing participant in torturing the animals. Being the eldest surviving son, K\u00fcrten was the target of much of his father's physical abuse. Although he was a good student, he later recollected his academic performance suffered due to the extensive physical violence he endured from his father. He frequently refused to return home from school.Monsters of Weimar p. 222 From an early age, K\u00fcrten often ran away from home for periods of time ranging from days to weeks. Much of the time K\u00fcrten spent on the streets was in the company of petty criminals and social misfits. Via these acquaintances, K\u00fcrten was introduced to various forms of petty crime, which he initially committed as a means of feeding and clothing himself when living on the streets.Monster: The True Story of Serial Killer Peter K\u00fcrten p. 33 K\u00fcrten later claimed to have committed his first murders at the age of nine, when he pushed a school friend who he knew was unable to swim off a log raft. When a second boy attempted to save the drowning youngster, K\u00fcrten held this boy's head underwater in order that both boys drowned. Both deaths were ruled by authorities as being accidental. ===Adolescence=== At the age of 13, K\u00fcrten formed a relationship with a girl his age who, although happy to allow K\u00fcrten to undress and fondle her, would resist any attempts he made to engage in intercourse.Monsters of Weimar p. 237 To relieve his sexual urges, K\u00fcrten resorted to acts of bestiality with the sheep, pigs and goats in local stables, but later claimed he obtained his greatest sense of elation if he actually stabbed these animals just before his achieving orgasm.Monster: The True Story of Serial Killer Peter K\u00fcrten p. 29 Thus, he began stabbing and slashing animals with increasing frequency to achieve orgasm, although he was adamant this behaviour ended when he was observed stabbing a pig. He also attempted to rape the same sister his father had earlier molested.World Famous Murders p. 394 In 1897, K\u00fcrten left school. At his father's insistence, he obtained employment as an apprentice molder. This apprenticeship lasted for two years before K\u00fcrten stole all the money he could find in his household, plus approximately 300 marksMonster: The True Story of Serial Killer Peter K\u00fcrten p. 30 from his employer, and ran away from home. He relocated to Koblenz, where he began a brief relationship with a prostitute two years his senior who, he claimed, willingly submitted to every form of sexual perversion he demanded of her. He was apprehended just four weeks later and charged with both breaking and entering and theft, and subsequently sentenced to one month's imprisonment. He was released from prison in August 1899 and reverted to the life of petty crime he had lived before his arrest. ==First attempted murder== K\u00fcrten claimed to have committed his first murder in November 1899.Serial Killers: True Crime p. 96 In his 1930 confessions to investigators, K\u00fcrten claimed to have \"picked up an 18-year-old girl at the Alleestra\u00dfe\", and persuaded her to accompany him to the Hofgarten. There, he claimed to have engaged in sex with the girl before strangling her to death with his bare hands.Monsters of Weimar p. 193 No contemporary records exist to corroborate K\u00fcrten's claims. If this attack did take place, the victim likely survived this assault. Nonetheless, K\u00fcrten later stated that, via his committing this act, he had proven to himself that the greatest heights of sexual ecstasy could only be achieved in this manner.One was Not Enough p. 108 ===First convictions=== Shortly thereafter, in 1900, K\u00fcrten was arrested for fraud. He would be rearrested later the same year on the same charge, although on this second occasion, charges pertaining to his 1899 D\u00fcsseldorf thefts, plus the attempted murder of a girl with a firearm were added to the indictment. Consequently, K\u00fcrten was sentenced to four years' imprisonment in October 1900. He served this sentence in Derendorf, a borough of D\u00fcsseldorf. Released in the summer of 1904, K\u00fcrten was drafted into the Imperial German Army; he was deployed to the city of Metz in Lorraine to serve in the 98th Infantry Regiment, although he soon deserted. That autumn, K\u00fcrten began committing acts of arson, which he would discreetly watch from a distance as emergency services attempted to extinguish the fires. The majority of these fires were in barns and haylofts, and K\u00fcrten would admit to police he had committed around 24 acts of arson upon his arrest that New Year's Eve. He also freely admitted these fires had been committed both for his sexual excitement and in the hopes of burning sleeping tramps alive. As a result of his desertion, K\u00fcrten was tried by the military court and convicted of desertion in addition to multiple counts of arson, robbery and attempted robbery (the latter charges pertaining to acts he had also committed that year), and was subsequently imprisoned from 1905 to 1913. K\u00fcrten served his sentence in M\u00fcnster, with much of his time spent in solitary confinement for repeated instances of insubordination.Monsters of Weimar p. 189 He would later claim to investigators and psychologists this period of incarceration was that in which he first encountered severe forms of discipline, and as such, the erotic fantasies he had earlier developed while incarcerated in Derendorf expanded to include graphic fantasies of his striking out at society and killing masses of people; these fantasies became ever more paramount and overbearing in his mind, and K\u00fcrten later claimed that he derived the \"sort of pleasures from these visions that other people would get from thinking about a naked woman\",Monsters of Weimar pp. 274-275 adding that he occasionally spontaneously ejaculated while preoccupied with such thoughts.Monster: The True Story of Serial Killer Peter K\u00fcrten p. 34 {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 0.5em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#t5dbf1; color:black; width:27em; max-width: 27%;\" cellspacing=\"5\" | style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"It was on 25 May 1913. I had been stealing, specialising in public bars or inns where the owners lived on the floor above. In a room above an inn at K\u00f6ln-M\u00fclheim, I discovered a child of about 10 asleep. Her head was facing the window. I seized it with my left hand and strangled her for about a minute and a half. The child woke up and struggled but lost consciousness ... I had a small but sharp pocketknife with me and I held the child's head and cut her throat. I heard the blood spurt and drip on the mat beside the bed. It spurted in an arch, right over my hand. The whole thing lasted about three minutes. Then I locked the door again and went back home to D\u00fcsseldorf.\"Crimes of Horror p. 140 |- | style=\"text-align: left;\" | Peter K\u00fcrten, recounting the murder of Christine Klein at his trial, 1931 |} ==Murders== ===First murders=== Christine Klein The first murder K\u00fcrten definitively committed occurred on 25 May 1913. During the course of a burglary at a tavern in M\u00fclheim am Rhein, he encountered a nine-year-old girl named Christine Klein asleep in her bed. K\u00fcrten strangled the child, then slashed her twice across the throat with a pocket knife, ejaculating as he heard the blood dripping from her wounds onto the floor by her bed.Monsters of Weimar p. 195 The following day, K\u00fcrten specifically returned to K\u00f6ln to drink in a tavern located directly opposite that in which he had murdered Klein, in order that he could listen to the locals' reactions to the child's murder. He later recollected to investigators that he derived an extreme sense of gratification from the general disgust, repulsion, and outrage he had heard in the patrons' conversations.Monster: The True Story of Serial Killer Peter K\u00fcrten p. 21 Moreover, in the weeks following Klein's funeral, K\u00fcrten occasionally travelled to M\u00fclheim am Rhein to visit the child's grave, adding that when he handled the soil covering the grave, he spontaneously ejaculated.Monsters of Weimar p. 254 Two months later\u2014again in the course of committing a burglary with the aid of a skeleton key\u2014K\u00fcrten broke into a home in D\u00fcsseldorf. Discovering a 17-year-old girl named Gertrud Franken, K\u00fcrten manually strangled the girl, ejaculating at the sight of blood spouting from her mouth. K\u00fcrten managed to escape from the scene of both this murder and that of Klein undetected.Monsters of Weimar p. 197 ==Imprisonment and release== Just days after the murder of Franken, on 14 July, K\u00fcrten was arrested for a series of arson attacks and burglaries. He was sentenced to six years' imprisonment, although his repeated instances of insubordination while imprisoned saw his incarceration extended by a further two years. K\u00fcrten served this sentence in a military prison in the town of Brieg (then part of the German Empire). Released in April 1921, K\u00fcrten relocated to Altenburg, where he initially lived with his sister. Through his sister, K\u00fcrten became acquainted with a woman three years his senior named Auguste Scharf, a sweet shop proprietor and former prostitute who had previously been convicted of shooting her fianc\u00e9 to death, and to whom K\u00fcrten initially posed as a former prisoner of war. Two years later, K\u00fcrten and Scharf married, and although the couple regularly engaged in sex, K\u00fcrten later admitted he could consummate his marriage only by fantasising about committing violence against another individual, and that, after their wedding night, he engaged in intercourse with his wife only at her invitation. For the first time in his life, K\u00fcrten obtained regular employment, also becoming an active trades union official, although with the exception of his wife, he formed no close friendships. In 1925, he returned with his wife to D\u00fcsseldorf, where he soon began affairs with a servant girl named Tiede and a housemaid named Mech. Both women were frequently subjected to partial strangulation when they submitted to intercourse, with Tiede once being informed by K\u00fcrten, \"That's what love means.\"Monsters of Weimar p. 197 When his wife discovered his infidelity, Tiede reported K\u00fcrten to police, claiming he had seduced her; Mech alleged K\u00fcrten had raped her. The more serious charge was later dropped, although Tiede's allegations were pursued, thus earning K\u00fcrten an eight-month prison sentence for seduction and threatening behaviour. K\u00fcrten served six months of this sentence, with his early release being upon the condition he left D\u00fcsseldorf. He later successfully appealed the ruling that he relocate from the city.Monsters of Weimar p. 197 ==1929== On 3 February 1929, K\u00fcrten stalked an elderly woman named Apollonia K\u00fchn. Waiting until K\u00fchn was shielded from the view of potential witnesses by bushes, K\u00fcrten pounced upon her, grabbing her by the lapels of her coat and shouting the words, \"No row! Don't scream!\"Monsters of Weimar p. 165 before dragging her into nearby undergrowth, where he proceeded to stab her 24 times with a sharpened pair of scissors.World Famous Murders p. 390 Although many of the blows were inflicted so deeply that the scissors struck her bones, K\u00fchn survived her injuries.Monsters of Weimar p. 199 The scissors used by Peter K\u00fcrten in many of his murders and attempted murders. On 8 February, K\u00fcrten strangled a nine- year-old girl named Rosa Ohliger into unconsciousness before stabbing her in the stomach, temple, genitals and heart with a pair of scissors, spontaneously ejaculating as he knifed the child. He then inserted his semen into her vagina with his fingers.Monster: The True Story of Serial Killer Peter K\u00fcrten p. 48 K\u00fcrten then made a rudimentary effort to hide Ohliger's body by dragging it beneath a hedgeMonsters of Weimar p. 163 before returning to the scene with a bottle of kerosene several hours later and setting the child's body alight, achieving an orgasm at the sight of the flames. Ohliger's body was found beneath a hedge the following day. Five days later, on 13 February, K\u00fcrten murdered a 45-year-old mechanic named Rudolf Scheer in the suburb of Flingen Nord, stabbing him 20 times, particularly about the head, back and eyes.Monsters of Weimar p. 201 Following the discovery of Scheer's body, K\u00fcrten returned to the scene of the murder to converse with police, falsely informing one detective he had heard about the murder via telephone. Despite the differences in age and sex of these three victims, the fact that all three crimes had been committed in the Flingern district of D\u00fcsseldorf at dusk, that each victim had received a multitude of stab wounds likely inflicted in rapid succession and invariably involving at least one wound to the temple, plus the absence of a common motive such as robbery, led investigators to conclude the same perpetrator had committed all three attacks. Furthermore, the seemingly random selection of these victims led criminologists to remark as to the abnormal nature of the perpetrator.Monsters of Weimar p. 166 Although K\u00fcrten did attempt to strangle four women between March and July 1929, one of whom he claimed to have thrown into the Rhine River,Monsters of Weimar p. 203 he is not known to have killed any further victims until 11 August when he raped, strangled, then repeatedly stabbed a young woman named Maria Hahn. K\u00fcrten had first encountered Hahn\u2014whom he described as \"a girl looking for marriage\"\u2014on 8 August, and had arranged to take her on a date to the Neandertal district of D\u00fcsseldorf the following Sunday. After several hours in Hahn's company, K\u00fcrten lured her into a meadow in order that he could kill her; he later admitted Hahn had repeatedly pleaded with him to spare her life as he alternately strangled her, stabbed her in the chest and head, or sat astride her body, waiting for her to die.Maria Hahn Hahn died approximately one hour after K\u00fcrten had begun attacking her. Fearful his wife might connect the bloodstains she had noted on his clothes with Hahn's murder, K\u00fcrten later buried her body in a cornfield, only to return to her body several weeks later with the intention of nailing her decomposing remains to a tree in a mock crucifixion to shock and disgust the public; however, Hahn's remains proved too heavy for K\u00fcrten to complete this act, and he simply returned her corpse to her grave before embracing and caressing the decomposing body as he lay beneath her remains.Monsters of Weimar p. 244 He then reburied Hahn's body. According to K\u00fcrten's later confession, both before and after he had attempted to impale Hahn's corpse to a tree, he \"went to the grave many times and kept improving on it; and every time I thought of what was lying there and was filled with satisfaction.\" Three months after K\u00fcrten had murdered Hahn, he posted an anonymous letter to the police in which he confessed to the murder, adding that her remains had been buried in a field. In this letter, K\u00fcrten also drew a crude map describing the location of her remains. This letter would prove sufficiently detailed to enable investigators to locate Hahn's remains on 15 November.Serial Killers: True Crime p. 97 Following the Hahn murder, K\u00fcrten changed his choice of weapon from scissors to a knife in an apparent effort to convince police more than one perpetrator was responsible for the unfolding crime spree. In the early morning of 21 August, K\u00fcrten randomly stabbed an 18-year-old girl, a 30-year-old man, and a 37-year-old woman in separate attacks. All three were seriously wounded, and all stated to police their assailant had not spoken a word to them before he had attacked them.One was Not Enough p. 114 Three days later, at a fairground in the suburb of Flehe,Crimes of Horror p. 134 K\u00fcrten observed two foster sisters (aged 5 and 14) walking from the fairground, through adjoining allotments, en route to their home. Sending the older girl, Luise Lenzen, on an errand to purchase cigarettes for him upon the promise of being given 20 pfennig, K\u00fcrten lifted the younger child, Gertrude Hamacher, off the ground by her neck and strangled her into unconsciousness before cutting her throat and discarding her body in a patch of runner beans. When Lenzen returned to the scene, K\u00fcrten partially strangled her before stabbing her about the torso, with one wound piercing her aorta.Monsters of Weimar p. 172 He also bit and twice cut her throat before sucking blood from the wounds.Monster: The True Story of Serial Killer Peter K\u00fcrten pp. 61-63 Neither girl had been sexually assaulted, and the fact only Lenzen's footprints were found within seven meters of her body suggests she may have attempted to flee from her attacker before collapsing. The following day, K\u00fcrten accosted a 27-year-old housemaid named Gertrude Schulte, who he openly asked to engage in sex with him. Upon being rebuffed, K\u00fcrten shouted, \"Well, die then!\"Monsters of Weimar p. 174 before repeatedly stabbing the woman in the head, neck, shoulder, and back. Schulte survived her injuries, although she was unable to provide investigators with a clear description of her assailant, beyond assuming his age to be around 40.Crimes of Horror p. 135 K\u00fcrten attempted to murder two further victims\u2014one by strangulation; another by stabbing\u2014in September, before opting to predominantly use a hammer in his murders. ===Hammer attacks=== Elizabeth D\u00f6rrier On the evening of 30 September, K\u00fcrten encountered a 31-year-old servant girl named Ida Reuter at D\u00fcsseldorf station. He successfully persuaded Reuter to accompany him to a caf\u00e9, then for a walk through the local close to the Rhine River.Monsters of Weimar p. 210 At this location, he repeatedly struck her about the head with a hammer both before and after he had raped her. At one stage in this assault, Reuter regained consciousness and began pleading with K\u00fcrten to spare her life. In response, K\u00fcrten simply \"gave her other hammer blows on the head, and misused her\". Eleven days later, on 11 October, he encountered a 22-year-old servant girl named Elizabeth D\u00f6rrier outside a theatre. As had been the case with Reuter, D\u00f6rrier agreed to accompany K\u00fcrten for a drink at a caf\u00e9 before the pair took a train to Grafenberg, with view to a walk alongside the Kleine D\u00fcssel river, where she was struck once across her right temple with a hammer, then raped. K\u00fcrten struck her repeatedly about the head and both temples with his hammer and left her for dead.Monsters of Weimar p. 212 D\u00f6rrier was found at 6:30 a.m the following morning, although she died from her injuries the following day, without awakening from the coma in which she was discovered. On 25 October, K\u00fcrten attacked two women with a hammer; both survived, although in the second instance, this was only because K\u00fcrten's hammer broke in the attack. On 7 November 1929, K\u00fcrten encountered a five-year-old girl named Gertrude Albermann in the Flingern district of D\u00fcsseldorf; he persuaded the child to accompany him to a section of deserted allotments, where he seized her by the throat and strangled her, stabbing her once in the left temple with a pair of scissors as he did so. When Albermann \"collapsed to the ground without a sound\", K\u00fcrten stabbed the child 34 further times in the temple and chest, before leaving her body in a pile of nettles against a factory wall.Monsters of Weimar pp. 210-211 ==Investigation== By the late summer of 1929, the murders committed by the individual the press had dubbed \"The Vampire of D\u00fcsseldorf\" were receiving considerable national and international attention.Monsters of Weimar p. 162 Due to the sheer savagery of the murders, the diverse background of the victims, and the differing methods in which they had been assaulted and/or murdered, both the police and the press theorized the spate of assaults and murders were the work of more than one perpetrator. By the end of 1929, D\u00fcsseldorf police had received more than 13,000 letters from the public. With assistance from surrounding police forces, each lead was painstakingly pursued. As a result of this collective investigation into the killings, more than 9,000 individuals were interviewed,Killers: The Ruthless Exponents of Murder p. 388 2,650 other clues painstakingly pursuedMonsters of Weimar p. 161 and a list of 900,000 different names were compiled upon an official potential suspect list.World Famous Murders p. 392 Two days after the murder of Gertrude Albermann, a local communist newspaper received a map revealing the location of the grave of Maria Hahn.World Famous Murders p. 391 In this drawing, K\u00fcrten also revealed precisely where he had left Albermann's body (which had been found earlier that day), describing the exact position of her corpse, which he stated could be found face-down among bricks and rubble. An analysis of the handwriting revealed the author was the same individual who had anonymously informed police in a letter dated 14 OctoberMonsters of Weimar p. 179 that he had killed Hahn and buried her body \"at the edge of the woods\". Each letter K\u00fcrten had thus far sent to newspapers and police describing his exploits and threatening further assaults and murders was examined by a graphologist,Monster: The True Story of Serial Killer Peter K\u00fcrten p. 58 who confirmed the same individual had written each letter, thus leading Ernst Gennat, chief inspector of the Berlin Police, to conclude that one man was responsible for most or all of the spate of assaults and murders. ===1930=== The murder of Gertrude Albermann proved to be K\u00fcrten's final fatal attack, although he did engage in a spate of non-fatal hammer attacks and attempted strangulations between February and May 1930,Monsters of Weimar p. 192 maiming 10 victims in these assaults. All recipients survived and many were able to describe their attacker to police. On 14 May 1930, an unknown man approached a 20-year-old woman named Maria Budlick at D\u00fcsseldorf station.Crimes of Horror p. 136 Discovering Budlick had travelled to D\u00fcsseldorf from K\u00f6ln in search of lodgings and employment, he offered to direct her towards a local hostel. Budlick agreed to follow the man, although she became apprehensive when he attempted to lead her through a scarcely populated park. The pair began to argue, whereupon another man approached the duo, asking whether Budlick was being pestered by her companion. When Budlick nodded, the man with whom she had been arguing simply walked away.Monster: The True Story of Serial Killer Peter Krten p. 89 The identity of the man who ostensibly came to Budlick's aid was Peter K\u00fcrten.One was Not Enough p. 117 K\u00fcrten invited the distressed young woman to his apartment on Mettmanner Stra\u00dfe to eat and drink before Budlick\u2014correctly deducing the underlying motive for K\u00fcrten's hospitality\u2014stated she was uninterested in engaging in sex with him.Monsters of Weimar p. 184 K\u00fcrten calmly agreed and offered to lead Budlick to a hotel, although he instead lured her into the Grafenburg Woods, where he seized her by the throat and attempted to strangle her as he raped her. When Budlick began to scream, K\u00fcrten released his grasp on her throat, before allowing her to leave. Budlick did not report this assault to police, but described her ordeal in a letter to a friend, although she addressed the letter incorrectly. As such, the letter was opened at the post office by a clerk on 19 May. Upon reading the contents of the letter, this clerk forwarded the letter to the D\u00fcsseldorf police. This letter was read by Chief Inspector Gennat, who assumed there was a slim chance Budlick's assailant might be the D\u00fcsseldorf murderer. Chief Inspector Gennat interviewed Budlick, who recounted her ordeal, further divulging one of the reasons K\u00fcrten had spared her was because she had falsely informed him she could not remember his address. She agreed to lead the police to K\u00fcrten's home, on Mettmanner Stra\u00dfe. When the landlady of the property let Budlick into the room of 71 Mettmanner Stra\u00dfe, Budlick confirmed to Chief Inspector Gennat this was the address of her assailant. The landlady confirmed to the chief inspector the tenant's name was Peter K\u00fcrten.World Famous Murders p. 393 ==Arrest and confession== Mug shots of K\u00fcrten, taken after his May 1930 arrest Although K\u00fcrten was not at home when Budlick and Chief Inspector Gennat searched his property, he spotted the pair in the communal hallway, and promptly left. Knowing that his identity was now known to the police and suspecting they may also have connected him to the crimes committed by the Vampire of D\u00fcsseldorf, K\u00fcrten confessed to his wife he had raped Budlick and that because of his previous convictions, he may receive 15 years' penal labour. With his wife's consent, he found lodgings in the Adlerstra\u00dfe district of D\u00fcsseldorf, and did not return to his own home until 23 May. Upon returning home, K\u00fcrten confessed to his wife he was the Vampire of D\u00fcsseldorf. With K\u00fcrten's full consent, he urged his wife to collect the substantial reward offered for his capture.The World's Most Evil Murderers: Real-Life Stories of Infamous Killers p. 23 Auguste K\u00fcrten contacted the police the following day. In the information provided to detectives, K\u00fcrten's wife explained that although she had known her husband had been repeatedly imprisoned in the past, she was unaware of his culpability in any murders. She then added that her husband had confessed to her his culpability in the D\u00fcsseldorf murders, and that he was willing to likewise confess to police. Furthermore, he was to meet her outside St. Rochus church later that day. That afternoon, K\u00fcrten was arrested at gunpoint.Crimes of Horror p. 137 K\u00fcrten freely admitted his guilt in all the crimes police had attributed to the Vampire of D\u00fcsseldorf, and further confessed he had committed the unsolved murders of Christine Klein and Gertrud Franken in 1913. In total, K\u00fcrten admitted to 68 crimes including 10 murders and 31 attempted murders. He made no attempt to excuse his crimes, but justified them upon the basis of what he saw as the injustices he had endured throughout his life. Nonetheless, he was adamant he had not tortured any of his child victims.Monsters of Weimar p. 269 K\u00fcrten also admitted to both investigators and psychiatrists that the actual sight of his victim's blood was, on many occasions, sufficient to bring him to orgasm,Cannibal Serial Killers: Profiles of Depraved Flesh-eating Murderers p. 189 and that, on occasion, if he experienced ejaculation in the act of strangling a woman, he would immediately become apologetic to his victim, proclaiming, \"That's what love is all about\". He further claimed to have drunk the blood from the throat of one victim, from the temple of another, and to have licked the blood from a third victim's hands. In one of these instances, he had drunk so much blood from the neck wound he had inflicted upon victim Maria Hahn that he vomited. K\u00fcrten also admitted to having decapitated a swan in the spring of 1930 in order that he could drink the blood from the animal's neck, achieving ejaculation in the process.Cannibal Serial Killers: Profiles of Depraved Flesh-eating Murderers p. 190 ===Psychological study=== As K\u00fcrten awaited his trial, then later as he awaited his execution, he was extensively interviewed by Dr. Karl Berg. In these interviews, K\u00fcrten stated to Dr. Berg that his primary motive in committing any form of criminal activity was one of sexual pleasure, and that he had begun to associate sexual excitement with violent acts and the sight of blood via indulging in both day-dreams and masturbation fantasies \u2014 particularly when he had been isolated from human contact. The majority of his assaults and murders had been committed when his wife had been working evenings, and the number of stab or bludgeoning wounds K\u00fcrten inflicted upon each victim had varied depending upon the length of time it had taken him to achieve an orgasm. Furthermore, the actual sight of his victim's blood had been integral to his sexual stimulation. K\u00fcrten further elaborated to Dr. Berg that once he had committed an attack or murder, the feeling of tension he experienced before the commission of the crime would be superseded by one of relief.Monsters of Weimar p. 229 In reference to the actual choice of weapon used in his attacks, K\u00fcrten stressed that although he had changed his actual method of attack to deceive investigators into believing they were seeking more than one perpetrator, the weapon he used was inconsequential in reference to his ultimate objective of seeing his victim's blood. Elaborating, K\u00fcrten stated: \"Whether I took a knife or a pair of scissors or a hammer in order to see blood was a matter of indifference to me or mere chance. Often after the hammer blows the bleeding victims moved and struggled, just as they did when they were throttled.\"Monsters of Weimar p. 243 K\u00fcrten further confided that although he had occasionally penetrated his female victims, he had only done so to feign the act of coitus as a motive for his crimes. He also confessed that many of his later strangulation victims had only survived his attacks because he had achieved an orgasm in the early throes of the assault. However, K\u00fcrten contradicted these claims by proclaiming to both Dr. Berg and legal examiners that his primary motive in all his criminal activities was to both \"strike back at [an] oppressive society\" for what he considered the injustice of his being repeatedly incarcerated throughout his life, and as a form of revenge for the neglect and abuse he had endured as a child.Monster: The True Story of Serial Killer Peter K\u00fcrten p. 118 These desires had fermented in his mind throughout the long periods he had been confined in solitary confinement for various forms of insubordination, and K\u00fcrten explained that he deliberately broke minor prison rules as a means of guaranteeing that he would be sentenced to solitary confinement in order that he could indulge in these psychosexual fantasies.Crimes of Horror p. 139 To Dr. Berg and the legal examiners, K\u00fcrten did not deny that he had sexually molested his female victims, or to have stroked or digitally penetrated their genitals as he stabbed, slashed, strangled or bludgeoned their bodies, although throughout his trial K\u00fcrten consistently claimed the sexual assault of his victims was not his primary motive. Both Berg and other psychologists concluded K\u00fcrten was not insane, was fully able to control his actions, and appreciated the criminality of his conduct. Each ruled K\u00fcrten was legally sane and competent to stand trial. ==Trial== On 13 April 1931, Peter K\u00fcrten stood trial in D\u00fcsseldorf. He was charged with nine counts of murder and seven of attempted murder, and was tried before Presiding Judge Dr. Rose. K\u00fcrten pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to each of the charges.Monster: The True Story of Serial Killer Peter K\u00fcrten p. 100 Aside from when delivering testimony, K\u00fcrten would spend the duration of his trial surrounded by a heavily guarded shoulder-high iron cage specifically constructed to protect him from attack by the enraged relatives of his victims, and his feet were shackled whenever he was inside this cage.Monster: The True Story of Serial Killer Peter K\u00fcrten p. 103 Proceedings began with the prosecution formally reciting each of the charges against K\u00fcrten, before they recited the formal confession he had provided to police following his arrest. When then asked by the presiding judge to describe why he had continued to commit acts of arson throughout 1929 and 1930, K\u00fcrten explained: \"When my desire for injuring people awoke, the love of setting fire to things awoke as well. The sight of the flames excited me, but above all, it was the excitement of the attempts to extinguish the fire and the agitation of those who saw their property being destroyed.\" {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 0.5em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#t5dbf1; color:black; width:27em; max-width: 27%;\" cellspacing=\"5\" | style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"I have none. Never have I felt any misgiving in my soul; never did I think to myself that what I did was bad, even though human society condemns it.

That was why I had no pity for my victims. \" |- | style=\"text-align: left;\" | Peter K\u00fcrten, responding to the presiding judge's question as to whether he possessed a conscience at his trial, 1931 |} Having first claimed that his initial confession had been delivered to simply allow his wife to recoup the reward money offered for the capture of the D\u00fcsseldorf Vampire,Monster: The True Story of Serial Killer Peter K\u00fcrten p. 104 several days into his trial, K\u00fcrten instructed his defence attorney that he wished to change his plea to one of guilty. Addressing the court, K\u00fcrten proclaimed: \"I have no remorse. As to whether recollection of my deeds makes me feel ashamed, I will tell you [that] thinking back to all the details is not at all unpleasant. I rather enjoy it.\" Further pressed as to whether he considered himself to possess a conscience, K\u00fcrten stated he did not.Monster: The True Story of Serial Killer Peter K\u00fcrten p. 6 Nonetheless, when pressed as to his motivation in confessing, K\u00fcrten reiterated: \"Why don't you understand that I am fond of my wife, and that I am still fond of her? I have done many wrongs; have been unfaithful over and over again. My wife has never done any wrong. Even when she heard of the many prison sentences I have served, she said: 'I won't let you down, otherwise you'll be lost altogether.' I wanted to fix for my wife a carefree old age.\"Monsters of Weimar p. 217 To counteract K\u00fcrten's insanity defence, the prosecution introduced five of the most eminent doctors and psychiatrists in Germany to testify at the trial; each testified that K\u00fcrten was legally sane and had been perfectly in control of his actions and impulses at all times. Typical of the testimony delivered by these experts was that of Professor , who testified as to K\u00fcrten's actual motivation in his crimes being the desire to achieve the sexual gratification he demanded, and that this satisfaction could only be achieved by acts of brutality, violence and K\u00fcrten's knowledge of the pain and misery his actions caused to others.Crime and Criminal Justice in Modern Germany p. 224 Dr. Karl Berg testified that K\u00fcrten's motive in committing murder and attempted murder was 90 percent sadism, and 10 percent revenge relating to his perceived sense of injustice for both the neglect and abuse he had endured both as a child and the discipline he endured while incarcerated.Monsters of Weimar p. 260 Moreover, Dr. Berg stated that despite K\u00fcrten's admission to having embraced and digitally penetrated the corpse of Maria Hahn, and to have spontaneously ejaculated while holding the soil covering the coffin of Christine Klein, his conclusion was that K\u00fcrten was not a necrophiliac.Monsters of Weimar p. 284 Further proof of K\u00fcrten's awareness was referenced by the premeditated nature of his crimes; his ability to abandon an attack if he sensed a risk of being disturbed; and his acute memory of both his crimes and their chronological detail. Also disclosed in the first week of the trial were the deaths of the two boys whom K\u00fcrten had confessed to drowning at the age of nine, with the prosecution suggesting these deaths indicated K\u00fcrten had displayed a homicidal propensity dating much earlier than 1913. However, this view was disputed by medical witnesses, who suggested that although indicative of an inherent depravity, these two deaths should not be compared to K\u00fcrten's later murders as to a child, the death of a friend can be seen as nothing more than an inconsequential passing. Upon cross-examination, K\u00fcrten's defence attorney, Dr. Alex Wehner,Monster: The True Story of Serial Killer Peret K\u00fcrten\" p. 110 did challenge these experts' conclusions, arguing the sheer range of perversions his client had engaged in was tantamount to insanity. However, each doctor and psychiatrist remained adamant as to K\u00fcrten being legally sane and responsible for his actions. In a further attempt to discredit the validity of many of the charges recited at the opening stages of the trial, Wehner also questioned whether the occasional physical inaccuracies of the crimes described in his client's confession equated to K\u00fcrten having fabricated at least some of the crimes, thus supporting his contention K\u00fcrten possessed a diseased mind. In response, Dr. Karl Berg conceded that sections of K\u00fcrten's confessions were false, but argued that the knowledge he possessed of the murder scenes and the wounds inflicted upon the victims left him in no doubt as to his guilt, and that the minor embellishments in his confessions could be attributed to K\u00fcrten's narcissistic personality.Monsters of Weimar p. 231Monster: The True Story of Serial Killer Peret K\u00fcrten\" p. 101 ===Conviction=== The trial lasted ten days. On 22 April, the jury retired to consider their verdict. They deliberated for under two hours before reaching their verdict:One was Not Enough p. 119 K\u00fcrten was found guilty and sentenced to death on nine counts of murder. He was also found guilty of seven counts of attempted murder. K\u00fcrten displayed no emotion as the sentence was passed, although in his final address to the court, he stated that he now saw his crimes as being \"so ghastly that [he did] not want to make any sort of excuse for them\". K\u00fcrten did not lodge an appeal of his conviction, although he submitted a petition for pardon to the Minister of Justice, who was a known opponent to capital punishment.Monsters of Weimar p. 288 The petition was formally rejected on 1 July. K\u00fcrten remained composed upon receipt of this news, and asked for permission to see his Confessor, to write letters of apology to the relatives of his victims, and a final farewell letter to his wife. All of these requests were granted. ==Execution== On the evening of 1 July 1931, K\u00fcrten received his last meal. He ordered Wiener Schnitzel, a bottle of white wine, and fried potatoes. K\u00fcrten devoured the entire meal before requesting a second helping. Prison staff decided to grant his request. At 6 o'clock on the morning of 2 July, Peter K\u00fcrten was executed by Carl Gr\u00f6pler with the guillotine in the grounds of Klingelputz Prison, Cologne.About the decapitation by executioner Carl Gr\u00f6pler read in detail: Blazek, Matthias, Scharfrichter in Preu\u00dfen und im Deutschen Reich 1866-1945, Stuttgart 2010, p. 74 He walked unassisted to the guillotine, flanked by the prison psychiatrist and a priest. Shortly before his head was placed on the guillotine, K\u00fcrten turned to the psychiatrist and asked the question: \"Tell me... after my head is chopped off, will I still be able to hear, at least for a moment, the sound of my own blood gushing from the stump of my neck? That would be the pleasure to end all pleasures.\"On Trial for Murder p. 54 When asked whether he had any last words to say, K\u00fcrten simply smiled and replied, \"No.\" ==Aftermath== Following K\u00fcrten's 1931 execution, his head was bisected and mummified; the brain was removed and subjected to forensic analysis in an attempt to explain his personality and behaviour. The examinations of K\u00fcrten's brain revealed no abnormalities. The autopsy conducted upon K\u00fcrten's body revealed that, aside from his having an enlarged thymus gland, K\u00fcrten had not been suffering any physical abnormality. The interviews K\u00fcrten granted to Dr. Karl Berg in 1930 and 1931 proved to be the first psychological study conducted upon a sexual serial killer. These interviews also formed the basis of Berg's book, The Sadist. Shortly after World War II, K\u00fcrten's head was transported to the United States. It is currently on display at the Ripley's Believe It or Not! museum in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin. ==Media== ===Film=== * The first film to draw inspiration from the murders committed by Peter K\u00fcrten, M, was released in May 1931.
