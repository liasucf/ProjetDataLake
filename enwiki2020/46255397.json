    "text": "Billy & the Kids is an American rock band formed in 2014 by Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann, Joe Russo's Almost Dead guitarist Tom Hamilton, Tea Leaf Green bassist Reed Mathis and the Disco Biscuits keyboardist Aron Magner. ==Origins and history== In September 2014 Bill Kreutzmann appeared at the second annual Lockn' Festival with a band billed as Bill Kreutzmann's Locknstep Allstars. The band was assembled to help fill in for Bob Weir & RatDog who cancelled their appearance at the festival and it consisted of Kreutzmann, Hamilton, Magner, Oteil Burbridge and Steve Kimock. They were joined for some songs by special guests Keller Williams, Taj Mahal, and Papa Mali. In late 2014 Kreutzmann announced the formation of Billy & the Kids which consists of almost the same lineup as the Locknstep Allstars, without Steve Kimock and with Reed Mathis playing bass in place of Oteil Burbridge.\"Bill Kreutzmann Confirms Billy and the Kids Lineup\", Jambands.com, October 8, 2014.
