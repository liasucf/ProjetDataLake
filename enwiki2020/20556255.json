    "text": "The Queen's College Boat Club (abbreviated QCBC) is the rowing club for members of The Queen's College, Oxford. It is one of the oldest boat clubs in the world, being founded in 1827. ==History== In 1837, the Club represented Oxford in a race against Lady Margaret Boat Club, representing Cambridge, and won. This event, held on the River Thames at Henley-on-Thames, is credited with leading to support from the town for the establishment of the Henley Royal Regatta. The club was last Head of the River in Eights in 1957, and in Torpids in 1958. A women's boat first competed in 1981 after admission of women to the college. It has since risen to as high as 2nd on the river during the 2006 Torpids competition, and 10th on the river during Summer Eights 2005. In recent years the men's first and second boats have risen steadily through the rankings of Summer Eights with the first eight now positioned at 15th on the river and second eight at 51st as of 2019. Notably, both boats achieved 'blades' (bumping on each day of the competition) in both the 2015 and 2017 regattas. ==See also== *The Queen's College, Oxford *Torpids *Summer Eights ==References== * ==External links== * Official website Category:1827 establishments in England Category:Rowing clubs of the University of Oxford Boat Club Category:Sports clubs established in 1827 Category:Rowing clubs in Oxfordshire Category:Rowing clubs of the River Thames ",
