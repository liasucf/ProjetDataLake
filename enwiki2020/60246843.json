    "text": "Grand Canyon Pioneer Cemetery, also known as Pioneer Cemetery, is a historic cemetery located near the Grand Canyon's South Rim. The cemetery is home to some 400 individual graves. Burial criteria include a three-year stint at the Park, and a significant contribution thereto. Among those buried there are pioneers, NPS administrators of Grand Canyon National Park and residents of Grand Canyon Village including John Hance, Pete Berry, Ralph Cameron, William Wallace Bass, Emery Kolb and M.R. Tillotson. Hance is the first to have been buried there. Also buried in the cemetery are the unidentified remains of the victims on the United Airlines flight involved in the 1956 Grand Canyon mid- air collision. The cemetery closed to new burials in 2017, but remains open for visitation. ==References== Category:Cemeteries in Arizona Category:Coconino County, Arizona ",
