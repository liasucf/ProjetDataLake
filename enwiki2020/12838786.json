    "text": "Live in Vienna, 1980 is a live collaborative album by German electronic music outfit Cluster and percussionist Joshi Farnbauer. It is the first of four live albums recorded by Cluster, and their only work with Farnbauer. The album was released as a limited edition cassette on the British York House Records (YHR) label. It was reissued in Germany on the Transmitter label.The Gruene Kraft In August 2010, the album was reissued as a double CD by the American label Important Records, including remastered audio and new artwork by Dieter Moebius. ==Background== On June 12, 1980 Cluster performed at the Wiener Festwochen Alternativ with Farnbauer. The style of much of the music is highly experimental and discordant and very reminiscent of Moebius and Roedelius' early work with Conrad Schnitzler in Kluster, albeit with updated electronic instrumentation. Two notable exceptions are \"Piano and \"Ausgang\", which are melodic in style. \"Piano\" concludes with a live rendition on \"Manchmal\" which originally appeared on the album Grosses Wasser (1979). Two excerpts from this album, were included as bonus tracks on the Hypnotic CD reissues of the first two Kluster albums, Klopfzeichen and Zwei-Osterei. A 15:56 long excerpt of \"Metalle\" beginning about 3:03 was included with \"Klopfzeichen\". A 15:10 long excerpt of \"Service\" beginning about 3:01 was included with \"Zwei-Osterei\" ==Track listing== #\"Service\" \u2013 32:00 #\"Kurz\" \u2013 4:30 #\"Piano\" \u2013 5:30 #\"Drums\" \u2013 13:30 #\"Metalle\" \u2013 25:15 #\"Ausgang\" \u2013 6:45 ==Personnel== *Hans-Joachim Roedelius \u2013 composer, performer *Dieter Moebius \u2013 composer, performer, artwork on CD reissue *Joshi Farnbauer \u2013 composer, performer *Michael J\u00fcrs \u2013 percussion on \"Metalle\" *Paul Rapnik \u2013 percussion on \"Metalle\" *Eric Spitzer- Marlyn \u2013 recording engineer ==Notes== == References == * Discogs Cluster & Joshi Farnbauer - Live In Vienna.
