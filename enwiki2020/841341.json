Clay's term as governor ended early when he was appointed by the state legislature to the United States Senate in 1837 (this was before popular election of senators). ===Spring Hill College=== In 1836, Governor Clay signed a legislative act which chartered Spring Hill College in Mobile, Alabama, the third oldest Jesuit college in the United States. The charter gave it \"full power to grant or confer such degree or degrees in the arts and sciences, or in any art or science as are usually granted or conferred by other seminaries of learning in the United States.\" The college resulted from the strong French Catholic traditions in the city, founded as a French colony. ===Creek War of 1836=== Clay\u2019s term in office was dominated by the Creek War of 1836 arising from resistance to Indian Removal, which had taken place in the Southeast since 1830.

The Creek were relocated to the Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) west of the Mississippi. Confrontations between Indians and white settlers occurred. ===Panic of 1837=== During the Panic of 1837, the United States suffered a financial crisis brought on by speculative fever. This crisis caused a run on the Bank of the State of Alabama. Clay ordered the bank to provide a detailed report of its finances, but it was unable to do so. ==United States Senate== After election by the state legislature, Clay served in the United States Senate from June 19, 1837 until his resignation on November 15, 1841.
