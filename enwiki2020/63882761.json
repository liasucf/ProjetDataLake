    "text": "Lapillicoccus is a genus of Gram positive, nonmotile, non-sporeforming bacteria. The bacteria are strictly aerobic and mesophilic. Cells of the genus are coccoid. The genus name is derived from Latin lapillus (a little stone) and coccus, referring to its original isolation from a stone and the shape of the cells. The genus is monospecific, with L. jejuensis as the only species. ==References== Category:Gram-positive bacteria Category:Bacteria genera Category:Actinomycetales Category:Monotypic bacteria genera ",
