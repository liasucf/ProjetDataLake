    "text": "The Far Eastern University \u2013 Nicanor Reyes Medical Foundation (also referred to as FEU NRMF - Institute of Medicine) is a medical school in the Philippines. It is related to, but independent from, Far Eastern University. FEU-NRMF created some of the finest names in the field of Philippine healthcare: seven Philippine Medical Association Presidents, six Presidents of the Philippine College of Surgeons, four Secretaries of Health, and one President of the World Medical Association. ==History== In 1952, the Institute of Medicine was established. The medical school was a dream of the founder of Far Eastern University, Dr. Nicanor Reyes, Sr. He was killed in World War II in 1946 in the battle for the liberation of Manila and never saw his dream realized. In the same year, the Board of Trustees under the chairmanship of Don Jose Cojuangco commissioned a Medical School Committee composed of Drs. Lauro H. Panganiban, Treasurer of FEU, Aureo F. Gutierrez, Director of the FEU Medical Clinic and Ricardo L. Alfonso to recruit faculty members and establish an Institute of Medicine. Faculties were contacted and equipment and facilities readied and in June 1952, the Institute of Medicine opened its doors to its first students. FEU-NRMF was founded by Dr. Nicanor B. Reyes, Sr. On October 22, 1955, the FEU Hospital opened its doors as a charitable institution and provided hospital training for students in medicine and nursing. It was erected on a trapezoidal lot at the northeastern part of the campus in Morayta Street (now Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. St.). It was built and equipped at a cost of \u20b11.5 billion and designed by architect Felipe Mendoza in collaboration with the hospital committee chaired by Lauro Panganiban, M.D., Nicanor M. Reyes Jr., Angel Palanca, and Ricardo Alfonso, M.D., who later became the first hospital director. Fe del Mundo, M.D., later named as National Scientist, headed the Department of Pediatrics; Carlos Sevilla, M.D., chaired the Ophthalmology Department; Gloria Aragon, M.D., the OB-GYN Department; Liborio Gomez, M.D., the Pathology Department; Jose Tirona, M.D., the X-Ray Department; Perpetuo Gutierrez, M.D., the Medicine Department; Jesus Nolasco, M.D., the Physiology Department. In 1970, the Institute of Medicine, School of Medical Technology, FEU Hospital and the Student Health Service Clinic were converted into a non-stock, non-profit educational foundation known as the FEU Dr. Nicanor B. Reyes Medical Foundation. ==West Fairview Campus and Medical Complex== On December 22, 1996, Dr. Josephine S. Cojuangco- Reyes (NRMF chairman and former FEU president) presided over the groundbreaking of the new P500 million modern medical school and hospital, assisted by Ricardo L. Alfonso, M.D., former FEU Hospital Director and I. M. Dean, and Philip S. Chua, M.D., FACS, FPCS, president (1995-1999) and Chairman (2002-2004) of the FEU-DNR School of Medicine Alumni Foundation, USA, and member of the FEUNRMF Board of Trustees (1998-2008). In 2001, the new facilities of the Medical Foundation were formally inaugurated. The ceremony was attended by former President Corazon Aquino as guest of honor. FEU-NRMF Medical Center is the only Level 3 university hospital situated in District 5, Quezon City. The hospital operates with 300 Hospital Beds, 10 Clinical Departments, 10 Accredited Residency Training Programs, and 6 Accredited Fellowship Programs. Its Medical Center is also accredited by PhilHealth as a Center of Excellence and the Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (PCHRD) has named the school as a Center of Excellence in Research. At the last meeting of the Association of Philippine Medical Colleges, CHED presented the five-year summary of board passing rank of medical schools. FEU-IM ranked third overall with the highest passing averages.
