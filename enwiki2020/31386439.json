Rani goes to Colombo for the University Sports Tournament, and while winning every single event she enters there, she injures her leg and is in hospital. Meanwhile, Kamini and Raja marry secretly, since he knows his woman-hating, upper caste father will never agree to this marriage. Captain Sundar, Kamini's childhood friend, comes from Rangoon and wants to marry Kamini, but is shattered as he finds out she is married to Raja. Raja's parents are told of the wedding and they call him home asking him to forget the marriage and marry a girl of their choice.

One sees his potential for zany comedy that would go on to flower fully in films like Aasha (1957), Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958) and Half Ticket (1962)\". == Box office == At the end of its theatrical run, the film grossed around 1,50,00,000, and became the second highest-grossing film of 1953 with a verdict of \"hit\". == Table of Penn and its remakes == {| class=\"wikitable\" !
