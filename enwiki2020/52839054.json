    "text": "The International African American Museum (IAAM) is a museum of African- American history being built in Charleston, South Carolina, on the site where Gadsden's Wharf, the disembarkation point of up to 40% of all American slaves, once stood. Construction of the IAAM began in January of 2020 after 20 years of planning. ==Conception and construction== The idea of the museum was initiated by former Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. The city had previously sold the land to a restaurateur however after construction on the site discovered traces of Gadsden's Wharf Riley decided to repurchase the land. The construction budget of the museum is $75 million. Joe Riley raised money for the project as a private citizen. The $25 million private donation goal was met in 2018. The South Carolina General Assembly delayed a $25 million contribution to the project which delayed construction of the 40,000-square-foot facility. The city of North Charleston donated $1 million to the project. Keith Sumney, the mayor of North Charleston, stated that he hoped the museum would include an exhibit on Liberty Hill, a historically black neighborhood in North Charleston. The design architect is Harry Cobb, of Pei Cobb Freed & Partners, working in collaboration with Moody Nolan architectural firm of Columbus, Ohio; the exhibition designer is Ralph Appelbaum Associates and the landscape designer is Walter Hood, of Oakland, California.Kimmelman, Michael (28 March 2018). \"Charleston Needs That African American Museum.
