When the government announces a plan to collectivize all the farms, Krestan is reluctant to hand over his property, and his neighbors share his sentiments. But when they realize the great advantages of collective ownership, they happily join in. ==Cast== * Hans Wehrl as Krestan Serbin * Lotte Loebinger as Serbinowa * Irene Korb as Lena * Kurt Oligm\u00fcller as Peter * Erich Franz as Gessner * Fritz Schlegel as Ladusch * Lore Frisch as Sonja * Fabian Wander as Herbert * Johannes Arpe as M\u00fcller * Dorothea Thiesing as Marta * Aribert Grimmer as Baumann * Hans Joachim Sch\u00f6lermann as Professor * William Gade as Kubank * Heinz Kammer as Rinke ==Production== The film was adapted from Jurij Br\u011bzan's novel by the same name, published in 1953. 52 Weeks Make One Year was the first East German film about the collectivization of agriculture in the country. ==Reception== The Socialist Unity Party of Germany's magazine, Einheit, dubbed 52 Weeks as one of the films \"that were completely supportive of the struggle for German unity and against imperialism and war.\"Zentralkomitee der Sozialistischen Einheitspartei Deutschlands. Einheit, 1956. p. 638. Sylvia Kl\u00f6tzer wrote that the film was made in Socialist Realist style.Sylvia Kl\u00f6tzer. Satire und Macht: Film, Zeitung, Kabarett in der DDR. B\u00f6hlau Verlag (2005). . p. 91. Johannes von Moltke noted that while \"suffused with images of rural bliss... rhythms of nature and local tradition\" typical to the genre of Homeland films, 52 Weeks \"is not entirely irreconcilable with the belief in progress\" and is an example to the East German agrarian pictures that focused on the benefits of the collectivization.Johannes von Moltke. No Place Like Home: Locations of Heimat in German Cinema. University of California Press (2005). . pp. 171\u2013172. The Catholic Film Service called it \"formalistic, but with good acting.\"52 Wochen sind ein Jahr on the German Film Lexicon. ==References== ==External links== * *52 Wochen sind ein Jahr original poster on ostfilm.de.
