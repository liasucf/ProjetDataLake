Grenville is located on Grenville Bay, about halfway up the east coast of the Caribbean island of Grenada and is heavily involved in the agriculture export industry. Grenville's Anglican Church and school stand at the north end of Victoria Street, the main thoroughfare along the bay. The town has a population of about 2,400 residents, with many more in the surrounding region. It serves as an economic and transportation hub for that part of the island, and once was home to the largest nutmeg-processing plant in Grenada. The town's marketplace houses a variety of fruit, vegetable, craft and meat stalls. Although opened everyday, the most popular day for activity is Saturday, the island's traditional 'market day'. A newly opened bus terminal on Sendal street allows for public transport in the form of minibuses to and from the town. On the outskirts of the town is Pearls Airport, Grenada's first airport. It is no longer used for aviation, but skeletons of abandoned Air Cuba planes are still present.
