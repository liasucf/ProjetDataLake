    "text": "This is a list of the major football derbies in Italy. Some derbies have developed on the basis of intra-city rivalries (locally called stracittadine, \"crosstowns\" in English), others on a regional basis and others are formed due to sporting or political rivalry and have little to do with geographical proximity. ==City derbies and their history== Early Italian football was characterised by numerous meetings between teams of the same cities, as teams would compete in regional preliminary phases in order to compete at the national level. During the 1920s, the fascist leaders noted the great propaganda potential in what had become the first national sport. Most Italian cities were restricted to a single club could play a professional, although this rule was relaxed in three major cities of Northern Italy: Genoa, Milan and Turin, places where Italian football was born, which meant that the individual clubs' cultures were by that point too ingrained. Further, due to the strong resistance of Lazio to join Roma, the same treatment was accorded to Rome, the capital. The first derby in the Italian top flight was played in Turin on 8 May 1898 between the F.B.C. Torinese and Internazionale F.C. Torino, teams that would merge to create Torino Football Club. When the Serie A began in 1929, three derbies were played in the top flight, which became four in 1935\u20131936. Eighty years later, a fifth derby took place for the first time in 2001\u201302 when former amateur side Chievo contested the Verona Derby with the more traditional Hellas Verona. The following city derbies are those that have been played at least once in Serie A. *Derby della Lanterna (Derby of the Lighthouse): Italy's oldest derby sees Genoa clash with Sampdoria. Sampdoria was formed in 1946, but other clubs from the city (which became the modern day Sampdoria) have contested the derby against Genoa since 1902.
