    "text": "Duck galantine Galantine with vegetables In French cuisine, galantine () is a dish of de-boned stuffed meat, most commonly poultry or fish, that is poached and served cold, coated with aspic. Galantines are often stuffed with forcemeat, and pressed into a cylindrical shape. Since deboning poultry is thought of as difficult and time-consuming, this is a rather elaborate dish, which is often lavishly decorated, hence its name, connoting a presentation at table that is galant, or urbane and sophisticated. In the later nineteenth century the technique's origin was already attributed to the chef of the marquis de Brancas.As in A. Kettner (pseudonym of Eneas Sweetland Dallas), Kettner's Book of the Table: A Manual of Cookery, 1877. Louis, marquis de Brancas, prince de Nisaro (1672\u20131750), had been governor of Provence and French ambassador to Spain; at the end of the Ancien R\u00e9gime his son held the sinecure of governor of Nantes (\u00c9tat militaire de France pour l'ann\u00e9e 1789). In the Middle Ages, the term galauntine or galantyne, perhaps with the same connotations of gallantry,Galantyne was a suitable name for a spirited horse mentioned in Sir William St Loe's accounts 1559\u201360 (Mary S. Lovell, Bess of Hardwick, Empire Builder 2005:144, note 3). referred instead to any of several sauces made from powdered galangal root, usually made from bread crumbs with other ingredients, such as powdered cinnamon, strained and seasoned with salt and pepper. The dish was sometimes boiled or simmered before or after straining, and sometimes left uncooked,Austin, Thomas Austin, Two fifteenth- century cookery-books. London: Oxford University Press, 1964. Pp. 77\u201378, HARLEIAN MS. 4016, ca. 1450CE depending on the recipe. The sauce was used with fish and eels,Easy Medieval SaucesA Newe Boke of Olde Cokery and also with geese and venison. The extravagant hyperbole of declarations of courtly love were burlesqued by Geoffrey Chaucer: > Was nevere pik walwed in galauntine > As I in love am walwed and vwounde.Norton Anthology: Chaucer, \"To Rosamond\" > : \"There was never a pike wallowed in galauntine sauce as I in love am > wallowed and rolled\". To Rosamond\" During the Siege of Leningrad in 1941\u20131942, the authorities created galantine from 2,000 tons of mutton guts that had been found in the seaport, and later, calfskin, to feed the starving residents of Leningrad. ==See also== * Ballotine * Head cheese * List of stuffed dishes * Terrine * Turducken ==References== ==External links== *Peter Hertzmann on galantine Category:Garde manger Category:Charcuterie Category:Stuffed dishes Category:French chicken dishes ",
