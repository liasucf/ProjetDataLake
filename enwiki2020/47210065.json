    "text": "XHUAX-FM is a radio station serving Toluca in the State of Mexico. It is the radio station of the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma del Estado de M\u00e9xico and broadcasts on 99.7 FM from its campus, with a transmitter on the Radio y Televisi\u00f3n Mexiquense tower in Metepec. ==History== XHUAX received its permit in February 2006 as part of the last round of permits awarded by the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation. The university, however, stalled in its efforts to plan for the station. With just months left to get the station on air, the project transferred from the cultural outreach department to university communications. Tests began in November, and XHUAX signed on February 21, 2007. ==References== Category:Radio stations in the State of Mexico Category:University radio stations in Mexico ",
