    "text": "The Naked Archaeologist was a television show produced for VisionTV in Canada and History International in the US, that was hosted and prepared by the Emmy Award\u2013winning journalist Simcha Jacobovici together with Avri Gilad. The show ultimately reviews Biblical stories, then tries to find proof for them by exploring the Holy Land looking for archaeological evidence, personal inferences, deductions, and interviews with scholars and experts. Subsequent to its original run on VisionTV, it was picked up in the U.S. by The History Channel and its sister network, History International. The third and final season began airing on Vision TV on March 22, 2010 and on History International on November 8, 2010. == Episodes == === Season 1 (2005) === # \"Delilah's People\" (5 September 2005) # \"Who Invented the Alphabet?\" (12 September 2005) # \"Jerusalem & The Black Prince\" (19 September 2005) # \"What Killed Herod?\" (26 September 2005) # \"Real or Fake?\" (3 October 2005) # \"Fame & Forgery?\" (10 October 2005) # \"Accidental Archaeology\" (17 October 2005) # \"Biblical Food\" (24 October 2005) # \"Jesus: The Early Years\" (31 October 2005) # \"John the Baptist\" (7 November 2005) # \"True Blue\" (14 November 2005) # \"Return of the Hilazon\" (21 November 2005) # \"Last Man Standing\" (28 November 2005) # \"Crucifixion\" (5 December 2005) # \"King David\" (12 December 2005) # \"Jezebel: Bible Bad Girl\" (19 December 2005) # \"The Oldest Leper\" (26 December 2005) # \"Joshua\" (2 January 2006) # \"Masada\" (9 January 2006) # \"Who Wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls?\" (16 January 2006) # \"Holy Hot Spot\" (23 January 2006) # \"Biblical Epicentre - Temple Mount\" (30 January 2006) # \"The Mother of Archaeology - St. Helena\" (6 February 2006) # \"Who Wrote the Bible?\" (13 February 2006) # \"Where is Mount Sinai?\" (20 February 2006) # \"The Real Mount Sinai\" (27 February 2006) === Season 2 (2008) === # \"The Would-be Messiah\" (16 May 2008) # \"The Search for St. Peter\" (History Channel International: 23 May 2008) # \"A Nabatean By Any Other Name\" (History Channel International: 30 May 2008) # \"Chasing the Temple Booty \u2013 Part One\" (History Channel International: 5 May 2008) # \"Chasing the Temple Booty \u2013 Part Two\" (History Channel International: 5 May 2008) # \"The Legacy of King Solomon \u2013 Part 1\" (History Channel International: 21 May 2008) # \"The Legacy of King Solomon \u2013 Part 2\" (History Channel International: 2008) # \"Decoding Ezekiel's Vision\" (History Channel International: 11 June 2008) # \"Jewish Rome\" (History Channel International: 18 June 2008) # \"The Giants of Genesis\" (History Channel International: 20 June 2008) # \"All in the Family\" (History Channel International: 2008) # \"The Curse of the Macabee Tomb \" (History Channel International: Fall 2008) # \"The Search for King David's Harp \" (History Channel International: Fall 2008) # \"Hangin' with Judas \" (History Channel International: Fall 2008) # \"The Miracle Workers of Galilee\" (History Channel International: 17 September 2008) # \"The Collector\" (History Channel International: 24 September 2008) # \"Cleanliness is Next to Godliness\" (History Channel International: 1 October 2008) # \"What Happened to the JC Bunch?
