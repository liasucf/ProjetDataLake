Horn Professor of Geosciences at Texas Tech University and Curator of Paleontology at the Museum of Texas Tech University.Texas Tech University :: Young Investigators He earned his Ph. D. from the University of Calcutta in 1970 and was a Post- doctoral Fellow at the Smithsonian Institution from 1977-1978. Dr. Chatterjee's has focused on the origin, evolution, functional anatomy, and systematics of Mesozoic vertebrates, including basal archosaurs, dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and birds.Handbook of Texas Online - VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY He has researched Late Triassic reptiles in India, such as phytosaurs, rhynchosaurs, and prolacertiformes. He is best known for his work on vertebrates recovered in the 1980s from the Post Quarry in the Late Triassic Cooper Canyon Formation (Dockum Group) of West Texas. The material includes the large rauisuchian Postosuchus, which was named for the nearby town of Post. It also included controversial specimens Chatterjee identified as being avian (Protoavis). The identification of these specimens as avian would push back the origin of birds by at least 75 million years.Paleontology Division: Dr. Sankar Chatterjee In 2008, Chatterjee and Rick Lind designed a 30-inch unmanned aerial vehicle with a large, thin rudder inspired by the crest of Tupandactylus, to be called a Pterodrone. The large, thin rudder-like sail on its head functioned as a sensory organ that acted similarly to a flight computer in a modern-day aircraft and also helped with the animal's turning agility. \u201cThese animals take the best parts of bats and birds,\u201d Chatterjee said. \u201cThey had the maneuverability of a bat, but could glide like an albatross. Nothing alive today compares to the performance and agility of these animals. They lived for 160 million years, so they were not stupid animals. The skies were darkened by flocks of them. They were the dominant flying animals of their time.\u201d \u201c[W]e\u2019ve found they could actually sail on the wind for very long periods as they flew over the oceans.... By raising their wings like sails on a boat, they could use the slightest breeze in the same way a catamaran moves across water. They could take off quickly and fly long distances with little effort.\u201d == Genera named == The following Genera were named by Prof. Chatterjee : {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" |- !
