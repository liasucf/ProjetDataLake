In 1979, BYU led the country in passing offense, total offense, and scoring offense during the regular season, and quarterback Jim McMahon finished fifth in the Heisman vote. In 1982, head coach LaVell Edwards named Chow as principal offensive play-caller. Chow continued to call all the offensive plays for the rest of his 17 years at BYU. In 1983, the offense, led by quarterback Steve Young, set NCAA single-season records for pass completion percentage (71.3%) and total yards per game (584.2). Young finished second in the Heisman vote. In 1984, the unbeaten BYU team won the consensus national championship. Quarterback Robbie Bosco finished second in the nation in total passing and third in the Heisman vote. Chow became quarterbacks and receivers coach in 1986. In 1990, the Cougars upset defending national champion and top- ranked Miami, FL., 28-21, with nearly 500 yards of offense and Ty Detmer went on to win the Heisman. In 1996, Chow was officially given the title of assistant head coach / offensive coordinator / quarterback / receivers coach. That season, the Cougars with Steve Sarkisian as quarterback, won the WAC and earned its first ever New Year's Day Bowl. BYU came from behind to beat Kansas State in the Cotton Bowl, and finished with No. 5 ranking and a 14\u20131 record, setting an NCAA record for most wins in a season by Division I football team.Loren Jorgensen, \"1996 Cotton Bowl: BYU 19, Kansas State 15 -- Cougars cotton to historic 14th win\" Deseret News 1997-01-02 Sarkisian finished the season with a quarterback rating of 162.0, the third highest in the country.

However, the Bruins' 2010 season proved to be an offensive disappointment: UCLA finished ranked 116th out of 120 teams nationally in passing yardage and 118th in passing efficiency, as they tried to install a pistol offense; in his three seasons, the team had a 15\u201322 record. On January 22, 2011, Chow departed UCLA after negotiating a buyout to the contract extension that would have paid him $1 million over the next two seasons rather than remain at UCLA and be demoted to a lesser coaching position.Chris Foster, UCLA fires Norm Chow, hires Mike Johnson, Los Angeles Times, January 22, 2011, Accessed January 23, 2011. While Chow made his reputation by developing quarterbacks, Ramona Shelburne of ESPNLosAngeles.com said he never really had one to develop at UCLA due to injuries to their quarterbacks. ===Utah=== Chow was immediately hired as the offensive coordinator of the Utah Utes, a team that was getting ready to enter its first season in the Pac-12. \"Rick [Neuheisel] did a nice job with [facilitating his exit at UCLA]. And [Utah] is a good football situation,\" said Chow. \"I went to school there, you know? I have two degrees from there. I met my wife there, my kids were born in Salt Lake.
