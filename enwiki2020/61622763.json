    "text": "One clean qubit quantum circuit that estimates the trace of U The One Clean Qubit model of computation is performed an n qubit system with one pure state and n-1 maximally mixed states. This model was motivated by highly mixed states that are prevalent in Nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computers. It's described by the density matrix \\rho = \\left|0\\right\\rangle \\langle 0| \\otimes \\frac{I}{2}, where I is the identity matrix. In computational complexity theory, DCQ1; also known as the Deterministic quantum computation with one clean qubit is the class of decision problems solvable by a one clean qubit machine in polynomial time with an error probability of at most 1/3 for all instances. ==Trace Estimation== Trace estimation is complete for DCQ1. Let U be a unitary 2^{n} \u00d7 2^{n} matrix. Given a state |\\psi\\rangle, the Hadamard test can estimate \\left\\langle\\psi\\mid U\\mid\\psi\\right\\rangle where \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathcal{Re}(\\left\\langle\\psi\\mid U\\mid\\psi\\right\\rangle) is the probability that the measured clean qubit is 0. I/2^{n} mixed state inputs can be simulated by letting |\\psi\\rangle be chosen uniformly at random from 2^{n} computational basis states. When measured, the probability that the final result is 0 is \\frac{1}{2^{n}} \\sum_{x \\subset \\\\{0, 1\\\\}^{n}}\\frac{1+\\mathcal{Re}\\left\\langle\\psi\\mid U\\mid\\psi\\right\\rangle}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\mathcal{Re}(Tr(U))}{2^{n}} . To estimate the imaginary part of the Tr(U), the clean qubit is initialized to \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle - i\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\right) instead of \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle +\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\right). ==DCQ1-complete Problems == In addition to unitary trace estimation, estimating a coefficient in the pauli decomposition and approximating the Jones polynomial at a fifth root of unity are also DCQ1-complete. In fact, trace estimation is a special case of pauli decomposition coefficient estimation. ==References== Category:Quantum computing ",
