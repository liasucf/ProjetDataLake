There are the customary fades, popular at the time, and a light, though constant, beat throughout that makes the music both accessible and even danceable, an impressive feat considering that virtually all the tunes are originals. ... With well-constructed arrangements, strong soloing, and catchy melodies, Brecker knew he was onto something, and this album was the first of several successful ventures\". ==Track listing== All compositions by Randy Brecker except where noted # \"Bangalore\" \u2013 4:34 # \"Score\" (Hal Galper) \u2013 7:17 # \"Name Game\" (Galper) \u2013 5:14 # \"The Weasel Goes Out to Lunch\" (traditional) \u2013 1:21 # \"Morning Song\" \u2013 4:09 # \"Pipe Dream\" \u2013 4:33 # \"The Vamp\" (Galper) \u2013 5:14 # \"The Marble Sea\" \u2013 5:44 ==Personnel== *Randy Brecker \u2013 trumpet, flugelhorn, arranger *Michael Brecker \u2013 tenor saxophone *Jerry Dodgion \u2013 alto flute *Larry Coryell \u2013 guitar *Hal Galper \u2013 piano, electric piano, arranger *Eddie G\u00f3mez \u2013 bass *Chuck Rainey \u2013 Fender bass *Bernard Purdie, Mickey Roker - drums == References == Category:Solid State Records (jazz label) albums Category:Randy Brecker albums Category:1969 albums Category:Albums produced by Duke Pearson Category:Albums recorded at Van Gelder Studio ",
