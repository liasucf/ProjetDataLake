    "text": "Dewtron (Design Engineering (Wokingham) Ltd. or D. E. W. Ltd.) were a small British manufacturer of modular synthesizers which were sold to customers in kit form or as built units. It was founded by Brian Baily on 5 February 1964 in Wokingham, Berkshire. By 1970 the company's products included oscillators, voltage controlled amplifiers, sample and hold and envelope shapers. Mike Rutherford used a Dewtron \"Mister Bassman\" bass pedal synthesizer on Genesis albums from Nursery Cryme (1971) onwards, before replacing it with a Moog Taurus I for the album A Trick of the Tail (1976). Yes' frontman Jon Anderson used a similar unit in live performances. Chris Carter, later to form Throbbing Gristle, experimented with Dewtron kit-based synthesizers early in his music career. The company later moved to the Ferndown area in Dorset (near Wimborne Minster) and shipped some synthesizer modules and related products from there before closing. == See also == * List of synthesizer manufacturers == References == == External links == * Dewtron, or how to hide your magic (if you have it) * 1970's Dewtron \"Mister Bassman\" Bass Pedal Synth Dewtron \"Mister Bassman\" Bass Pedal Synth * An article about Dewtron \"Mister Bassman\" Bass Pedal Synth * Dewtron at SynthMuseum.com Category:Synthesizer manufacturing companies Category:Musical instrument manufacturing companies of the United Kingdom ",
