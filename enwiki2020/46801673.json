Kar\u0142owska became an apprentice seamstress in Berlin and started to collaborate with her elder sister as well as ill people in the area even after she had returned to Poland. In November 1892 she met a poor girl named Franke and this encounter inspired her to aid the neglected and abandoned after hearing her talk about her life. The nun fostered an intense devotion to the Sacred Heart. Her religious congregation was established on 8 September 1896 and she \u2013 as well as several others \u2013 made her solemn profession as a nun on 20 June 1902; she served as the Superior General from the founding until her death.
