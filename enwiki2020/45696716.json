When extending the concept of line to the line at infinity, a set of parallel planes can be seen as a sheaf of planes intersecting in a line at infinity. To distinguish it from the more common definition the adjective parallel can be added to it, resulting in the expression: parallel sheaf of planes.Vitutor: Sheaf of Planes ==See also== *Book embedding, a notion of graph embedding onto sheafs of half-planes ==Notes== Category:Geometry Category:Surfaces Category:Mathematical concepts ",
