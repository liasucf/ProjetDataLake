    "text": "\"Polly Wolly Doodle\" is a traditional American children's song. It was sung by Dan Emmett's Virginia Minstrels, who premiered at New York's Bowery Amphitheatre in February 1843,Lee Davis, Scandals and Follies: The Rise and Fall of the Great Broadway Revue (New York: Limelight Editions, 2000), p. 31., according to http://civilwartalk.com/threads/polly-wolly-doodle.15345/ and is often credited to Emmett (1815\u20131904). It was known to have been performed by the Yale Glee Club in 1878 and was first published in a Harvard student songbook in 1880. \"Polly Wolly Doodle\" appears in the existing manuscript for Laura Ingalls Wilder's These Happy Golden Years (1943) exactly as it is used in the published version. The melody of this song as it is usually sung formed the basis for Boney M.'s hit \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday\" in 1979,https://www.sonymusic.de/kuenstler/boney-m; in German and also for Alexandra Burke's song \"Start Without You\". The tune is also found in children's music, including the Sunday school song \"O-B-E-D-I-E-N-C-E\", the German group die Lollipops' \"Radio Lollipop\", and the Barney & Friends songs \"Alphabet Soup\" (though only using the first verse's tune) and \"If I Had One Wish\" (which uses both verses). == Notable recordings == * 1917: Harry C.
