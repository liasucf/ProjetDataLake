    "text": "is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by S\u014dsuke Kaise, published by Kadokawa Shoten's Sh\u014dnen Ace in 2003. The manga was adapted into an animated television series in 2004. The anime series aired on WOWOW from October 14, 2004 to January 13, 2005, totaling twelve episodes. == Plot == Grenadier follows the travels of Rushuna Tend\u014d, an expert gunfighter, and the samurai Yajir\u014d Kojima, a mercenary swordsman. A Senshi or \"Enlightened\" is one who is skilled to some degree in the use of guns. The series begins with Yajir\u014d and a small army of samurai launching a frontal assault against a fort in an attempt to free their lord, which was taken over by a group of gunners. The assault fails. Yajir\u014d orders a retreat, but is spotted by the enemy and chased to a small cliff, which he jumps off of to escape. With his pursuers still following, he follows a nearby hot-water stream upcurrent where he finds Rushuna bathing in a hot spring. She seems undisturbed by his presence or her own nudity and hides him in the hot spring with her ample breasts as cover until the enemy passes them by. After this, she introduces herself as a traveler and reveals the ultimate battle strategy to Yajir\u014d; to avoid battle by removing an enemy's will to fight. Hearing the gunfire of the renewed assault upon the fort, Yajir\u014d leaves Rushuna to rejoin combat. He arrives in time to see the leader of the gunners use a Gatling gun to decimate the samurai. Rushuna also arrives at this point and shows her considerable gun talent and effectively ends the battle by defeating the lead gunner and rescuing the lord by herself. Something in him changing, Yajir\u014d decides to become Rushuna's partner and travel with her. During their travels, Rushuna and Yajir\u014d face a mysterious masked figure known only as \"The Jester\" who is responsible for a weapon called \"Enlightened Evil\". Then they discover that Tenshi, who sent Rushuna to travel in order to learn the \"Ultimate Battle Strategy\", had apparently put a price on her head. Joined by a young girl named Mikan Kurenai, a balloon maker, Rushuna and Yajir\u014d make their way to the capital of Tento. Along the way they overcome many of the Juttensen, Tenshi's elite personal bodyguard. When the three reach Tento they discover the truth and the final showdown against the Jester begins. == Media == ===Manga=== Grenadier was published in Kadokawa Shoten's Sh\u014dnen Ace in 2003.

But if you like the idea of a skimpily-clad lead female character who reloads her revolver by bouncing six bullets out of her cleavage and loading them into her gun in midair then you should check out this title.\" \u2014 Matthew Alexander, Mania. :\"Yes, Rushuna is eye-candy and there are plenty of upskirt shots to keep most otaku happy, but she's also a complete badass with a gun. Hopefully future volumes will develop her character more so this isn't all we have to judge her on.\" \u2014 A. E. Sparrow, IGN. ;Anime :\"The character of Yajiro is a refreshing change from the typical male sidekick seen in this genre. Rushuna's character is not quite as appealing at the start, but her ties to the underlying main plot, along with the plot itself, have great potential.\" \u2014 Luis Cruz, Mania. :\"Well, Rushuna seems to have a penchant for baths and hotsprings, which means nudity of the non-explicit variety. There are also a lot of battles and fights, which does lead to red shirt death and bleeding wounds. Things never get really messy, though, so the show is probably fine for teenagers.\" \u2014 Stig H\u00f8gset, T.H.E.M.
