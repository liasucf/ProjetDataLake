It was debuted at the 2005 Vision Festival with the Nancy Zendora Dance Company and video art by Jo Wood-Brown.Original Liner Notes by Rob Brown ==Reception== The All About Jazz review by Sean Patrick Fitzell notes that \"The textural range of the instrumentation, particularly the exotic percussion and the music's spaciousness of form allows for non-idiomatic exploration that is not strictly free improvisation.\"Fitzell, Sean Patrick. Sounds review at All About Jazz The Penguin Guide to Jazz states \"A logical move to employ Levin, given how much Brown seems to relish a singing bass tone and long, legato lines... Things as 'Stutter Step' underline how much of Brown's language still comes from the '60s avant-garde, but there is considerable more going on here.\" ==Track listing== :All compositions by Rob Brown except as indicated # \"Sounds part I Archaeology\" \u2013 12:30 # \"Sounds part II Antics\" \u2013 6:27 # \"Sounds part III Astir\" \u2013 10:34 # \"Sutter Step\" \u2013 4:25 # \"Tibetan Folk Song\" (Traditional) \u2013 8:47 # \"Sinew\" \u2013 7:33 # \"Moment of Pause\" \u2013 7:23 ==Personnel== *Rob Brown \u2013 alto sax *Daniel Levin - cello *Satoshi Takeishi \u2013 percussion ==References== Category:2007 albums Category:Rob Brown (saxophonist) albums Category:Clean Feed Records albums ",
