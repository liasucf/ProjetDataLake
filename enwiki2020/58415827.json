Journal of Physical Chemistry (USSR), v. 32(8), p. 1893, 1958; {| |style = width:100| ||style = width:500 | ||style = width:100| |- | || L = L_0 \\tanh\\left( \\frac{L T_C}{L_0 T}\\right) || (1) |} where L is the latent heat of vaporization at the temperature T, T_C is the critical temperature, L_0 is the parameter that is equal to the heat of vaporization at zero temperature (T \\rightarrow 0). This equation was obtained in 1955 by Yu. I. Shimansky, at first empirically, and later derived theoretically. Shimansky equation does not contain any arbitrary constants, since the value of T_C can be determined experimentally and L_0 can be calculated using (1) if L has been measured experimentally for at least one given value of temperature T. Shimansky equation describes quite well the heat of vaporization for a wide variety of liquids. For chemical compounds that belong to the same class (e.g. alcohols) the value of L_0/T_C ratio remains constant. For each such class of liquids, Shimansky equation can be re-written in a form of : \\frac{L}{AT_C} = \\tanh\\frac{L}{AT}, where A = L_0/T_C = \\text{const} . The latter formula is a mathematical expression of structural similarity of liquids. The value of T_C plays a role of the parameter for a group of curves of temperature dependence of L. == Sources == *Shimansky Yu.
