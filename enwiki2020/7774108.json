    "text": "Grypania is an early, tube-shaped fossil from the Proterozoic eon. The organism, with a size over one centimeter and consistent form, could have been a giant bacterium, a bacterial colony, or a eukaryotic alga. The oldest probable Grypania fossils date to about 2300 million years ago (redated from the previous 1870 million)Schneider, D. A., Bickford, M. E., Cannon, W. F., Schulz, K. J., & Hamilton, M. A.
