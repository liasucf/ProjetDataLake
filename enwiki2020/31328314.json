This evidence is based on randomized allocation of community-driven development programs across regions in Sierra Leone (with Katherine Casey and Edward Miguel). * A randomized evaluation on the impact of Microfinance in India showed that microcredit group-based lending had little impact on consumption, health, education, women's empowerment, average business profits, starting a new business, and on average monthly expenditure per capita. Yet positive effects were found on durable goods expenditure and business investments (with Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, and Cynthia Kinnan). * In a research of behavioral economics of complying with tuberculosis medication in Pakistan, researches measured the impact of daily SMS medication reminders of treatment outcomes to patients of tuberculosis. No impact was found between the SMS messages and patients' self-reported adherence to treatment regimes, physical health, and psychological health (with Aamir Khan and Shama Mohammed). ==References== Category:Development economists Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:Alumni of Birkbeck, University of London Category:British economists Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Harvard Institute for International Development Category:20th-century economists Category:21st-century economists Category:British women economists ",
