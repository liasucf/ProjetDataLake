    "text": "The Portia White Prize is the largest prize of its type awarded by the Province of Nova Scotia and is named for Portia White, a Nova Scotian artist who rose through adversity to achieve international acclaim as a classical singer on the stages of Europe and North America. Although Portia White began her career teaching in Africville, she eventually turned her energy to developing her enormous musical talent. Portia White became a world-renowned contralto through much hard work and dedication and the financial support of the Nova Scotia Talent Trust, a charitable organization created in 1944 by the Halifax Ladies Music Club, the music community and the Province. Upon retiring from the stage, Ms. White devoted her time to teaching and coaching young singers. Her achievements continue to instill a sense of pride in the African Nova Scotian community and stand as a model to all Nova Scotians. The purpose of the Portia White Prize is to recognize cultural and artistic excellence on the part of a Nova Scotian artist who has attained professional status, mastery and recognition in their discipline. To enable the province of Nova Scotia to promote excellence in the arts by honouring an outstanding Nova Scotian artist who has made a significant contribution to the province\u2019s cultural life. The primary recipient, who is an established artist, either born in Nova Scotia or resident in the province for at least the past four years, will receive $18,000 and a certificate of recognition. A secondary recipient, also called the \"prot\u00e9g\u00e9\", who is an emerging Nova Scotian artist or a Nova Scotian cultural organization selected by the primary recipient, will receive $7,000 and a certificate of recognition. ==Recipients== 2013 Laurie Swim 2012 Thom Fitzgerald 2011 James MacSwain 2010 Mary Jane Lamond 2009 Mary Vingoe 2008 Walter Ostrom 2007 Joleen Gordon 2006 Wayne Boucher 2005 Walter Borden 2004 Jim Morrow 2003 Charlotte Wilson-Hammond 2002 Sylvia Hamilton 2001 Alistair MacLeod 2000 Garry Kennedy 1999 Georg Tintner 1998 George Elliott Clarke ==References== ==External links== * Category:Nova Scotia awards Category:Canadian art awards ",
