Aimed at pre-schoolers, when the Corn Popper is pushed or pulled, colored balls inside a plastic dome bounce and create a popping, bouncing noise.Fisher Price Logo ==History== The Corn Popper was invented in 1957 by Arthur Holt, who died in April 1996, and sold to Fisher-Price for $50.Inventor Arthur Holt Dies of Cancer at 74, NPR All Things Considered, 9 April 1996, (retrieved 8 September 2010 from HighBeam Research) The Corn Popper is one of the most popular toys for young children in history, and was designed to help them learn to walk. It sends tiny, colorful, gumball size balls flying and hitting the plastic dome, to create its signature loud popping noise. ==Accessories== Corn Popper keyrings are also on the market; they are miniature versions and can still pop corn. ==References== ==External links== *Official website * Category:Products introduced in 1957 Category:Fisher-Price Category:Physical activity and dexterity toys ",
