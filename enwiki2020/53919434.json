    "text": "Miss Bates is a supporting character in Jane Austen's 1815 novel Emma. Shabby genteel, and a compulsive talker, she is memorably insulted on one occasion by the book's heroine, to the latter's almost immediate remorse. ==Background== Living in genteel poverty with her ageing widow of a mother, and only one servant, Miss Bates was nonetheless on visiting terms with the best in Highbury society.E. Copeland, The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen (Cambridge 1997) p. 125-6 At the same time, she was dependent on her neighbours for much support \u2013 pork from Mr. Woodhouse, apples from Mr Knightley.E. Copeland, The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen (Cambridge 1997) p. 107 and p. 141 Those who see Austen as painting uncritically a rural Tory paradise should remember the latter's words to Emma:R. Jenkins, A Fine Brush on Ivory (Oxford 2007) p. 153 \u201cShe is poor; she has sunk from the comforts she was born to; and if she live to old age, must probably sink more\u201d.Jane Austen, Emma (Penguin 1973) p. 368 (Ch. 43) ==Characteristics== Miss Bates has as her main characteristic an unending flow of trivial speech, freely associating from one unimportant event to another \u2013 something which was to make her an immediate comic success among Austen's first readership.C. Harman, Jane's Fame (Edinburgh 2009) p. 74 Many of the clues to the book's intrigue are in fact artfully concealed and revealed within her verbose patter.P. Graham, Jane Austen and Charles Darwin (2016) p. 37 Her speech is overtly a recognition of her grateful dependence on her neighbours, but it can also be seen, in its overwhelming impact on all other discourses, as almost tyrannical in its passive-aggressive self-assertion.E. Auerbach, Searching for Jane Austen (2004) p. 209 ==Possible inspiration== Austen was, like Miss Bates, the single daughter of a clergyman's widow, and, while she herself was notoriously silent in company,C. Harman, Jane's Fame (Edinburgh 2009) p. 66-7 her letters by contrast have a rambling, inconsequential flow that has been compared to the speech of her creation:E. Copeland, The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen (Cambridge 1997) p. 104 \u201cmy coarse spot, I shall turn it into a petticoat very soon. - I wish you a Merry Christmas, but no compliments of the Season\u201d.Deirdre Le Faye ed, Jane Austen's Letters (Oxford 1995) p. 30 While she herself has thus been seen as a possible model for Miss Bates,P. Graham, Jane Austen and Charles Darwin (2016) p. 53 another single spinster, Miss Milles, who \u201ctalked on...for half an hour, using such odd expressions & so foolishly minute that I could hardly keep my countenance\u201d, has also been suggested as a possible external influence.Deirdre Le Faye ed, Jane Austen's Letters (Oxford 1995) p. 245, p. 332 and p. x ==See also== ==References== Category:Emma characters Category:Literary characters introduced in 1815 Category:Female characters in literature ",
