    "text": "Lan Samantha Chang (\u5f35\u5d50; pinyin: Zh\u0101ng L\u00e1n) is an American writer of novels and short stories. She is the Elizabeth M. Stanley Professor in the Arts at the University of Iowa and the Director of the Iowa Writers' Workshop. == Life and career == Lan Samantha Chang was born in Appleton, Wisconsin and attended college at Yale where she earned her bachelor's degree in East Asian Studies. She worked in publishing in New York City briefly before getting her MPA from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. She is a graduate of the Iowa Writers' Workshop and was a Wallace E. Stegner Fellow in Fiction at Stanford. She is currently the Elizabeth M. Stanley Professor in the Arts at the University of Iowa and the Director of the Iowa Writers' Workshop. She is the first woman, and the first Asian American, to hold that position. Chang's first book is a novella and short stories, titled Hunger (1998). The stories are set in the U.S. and China, and they explore themes of home, family, and loss. The New York Times Book Review called it \"Elegant.\u2026 A delicately calculated balance sheet of the losses and gains of immigrants whose lives are stretched between two radically different cultures\" while The Washington Post called it \"A work of gorgeous, enduring prose.\" Her first novel, Inheritance (2004), is about a family torn apart by the Japanese invasion during World War II. The Boston Globe said about it: \"The story\u2026is foreign in its historical sweep and social detail but universal in its emotional truth.\" Chang's latest novel, All Is Forgotten, Nothing is Lost (2011), follows two poets and their friendship as they explore the depths and costs of making art. The book received a starred review from Booklist and praise: \"Among the many threads Chang elegantly pursues\u2014the fraught relationships between mentors and students, the value of poetry, the price of ambition\u2014it is her indelible portrait of the loneliness of artistic endeavor that will haunt readers the most in this exquisitely written novel about the poet\u2019s lot.\" Chang has received fellowships from the MacDowell Colony, the American Library in Paris, the Guggenheim Foundation, the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, and the National Endowment for the Arts. == Awards and Distinctions == * 1993 : James Michener-Copernicus Award, University of Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop * 1993 : Wallace E.
