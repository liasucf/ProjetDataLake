She left McKinsey to become Chief Executive Officer of NursingHands, Inc., a web-based business that provided continuing education, e-commerce and job placement for healthcare professionals. Coleman sold NursingHands in 2002 to strategic investor Jobson PLC, which merged the company with its multimedia property NurseWeek. In 2004, the combined business was bought by the media company Gannett. ==The Council on Foreign Relations== Returning to international affairs, Coleman became a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, where she focused on the political economy of the Middle East. In 2002, she founded CFR\u2019s Women and Foreign Policy program to focus foreign policy attention on the importance of improving the status of women around the world. In 2010, she became the founding director of CFR\u2019s Civil Society, Markets and Democracy program. Coleman is well known for her writing on women and economic development, including her groundbreaking article, \u201cThe Payoff From Women\u2019s Rights\u201d (Foreign Affairs, May 2004). She has also published widely about gender in the Middle East, including her 2010 book Paradise Beneath Her Feet: How Women are Transforming the Middle East (Random House), which the Los Angeles Times described as \u201coutstanding\u201d and The Economist as \u201cnuanced.\u201d.

She appeared before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations for a confirmation hearing on December 2, 2014. In her statement before the Committee, Coleman noted the significant gap between the promise of the UN and the reality of its shortcomings, and vowed to ensure that the \u201cUN is deploying its resources in the most efficient and effective way.\u201dhttp://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Coleman_Testimony.pdf She was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on December 16, 2014. Coleman led U.S. efforts to reform the $40 billion UN system by imposing fiscal discipline, increasing transparency and accountability, and driving structural changes. During her tenure, the U.S. secured more than $500 million in annual peacekeeping budget reductions through the right-sizing of missions; the elimination of hundreds of UN back-office positions through automation; the first revision to the compensation package for UN staff, resulting in annual savings of more than $100 million; and significant efficiencies in the use of UN real estate. Coleman was also a leader on the U.S. efforts to combat sexual exploitation and abuse by UN peacekeepers, helping to secure watershed resolutions that increased transparency through the naming of those countries with troops accused of abuses, and increased penalties through the repatriation of entire military contingents in the case of unaddressed or repeated abuse. She was the administration's chief spokesperson on these issues, testifying several times before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Additionally, she fought to end the unfair exclusion of Israel within the UN system, including by successfully negotiating a milestone agreement to recognize Yom Kippur as an official UN holiday. During the fall of 2016 and early 2017, Coleman represented the United States in the UN Security Council, with responsibility for Africa, Asia and peacekeeping issues. In that capacity, she negotiated Security Council resolutions on South Sudan, Darfur, The Gambia, Liberia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and North Korea. She was also the lead negotiator of UN Security Council Resolution 2320 for stronger cooperation between the UN and the African Union. ==Awards== In 2007, she was named the Isabel Benham Award winner by the Women\u2019s Bond Club (WBC) of New York.http://womensbondclub.com/events/annual-awards/isabel-benham-award/ This award includes the privilege of directing a $25,000 donation from the WBC to a charity of the winner\u2019s choice.
