The 2017 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship was the 130th staging of the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship since its establishment by the Gaelic Athletic Association in 1887. The championship began on 23 April 2017 and ended on 3 September 2017. The draw for the championship was held on 13 October 2016 and was broadcast live on RT\u00c92. Tipperary, the 2016 champions, were defeated by Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final. Meath fielded a team in the championship for the first time since 2004. On 3 September 2017 Galway won the championship following a 0-26 to 2-17 defeat of Waterford in the All- Ireland final. This was their fifth All-Ireland title and their first in 29 championship seasons. ==Format== The All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship was a double-elimination tournament based on the Leinster and Munster provincial championships and the Christy Ring Cup. Fifteen teams took part. The 2017 championship was the last to feature mostly knock-out Leinster and Munster championships. On 30 September 2017, the Special Congress held at Croke Park voted by 62% to restructure the Leinster and Munster championships as two provincial groups of five teams who compete on a round-robin basis. ===Leinster and Munster Championship Formats=== Leinster Senior Hurling Championship Seven of the twelve Leinster counties compete. Galway and Kerry, though not in Leinster, also participate. The competition begins with a qualifier group consisting of the four weakest teams. Two teams from the qualifier group progress and the remainder of the competition is knock-out. Most of the beaten teams enter the All-Ireland qualifiers \u2013 the two bottom teams in the Leinster qualifier group do not. In 2017 the bottom team in the Leinster qualifier group will be relegated to next year's Christy Ring Cup (2nd tier). Their place in next year's Leinster qualifier group will be taken by the winner of 2017's Christy Ring Cup. Meath qualified for this year's Leinster Championship by winning the 2016 Christy Ring Cup. Munster Senior Hurling Championship Five of the six Munster counties compete. Kerry participates in The Leinster Hurling Championship (see above). The competition has a knock-out format. All of the beaten teams enter the All-Ireland qualifiers. ===Qualifiers Format=== The eight teams beaten in the quarter- finals and semi-finals of the Leinster and Munster Hurling Championships enter the All-Ireland hurling qualifiers. The GAA congress held in February 2017 voted to allow the winners of the 2017 Christy Ring cup to enter the 2017 qualifiers in a new preliminary round. The qualifiers are knock-out and eventually result in two teams who progress to the two All-Ireland quarter- finals. ===All-Ireland Format=== The beaten finalists in the Leinster and Munster championships play the two winning teams from round two of the qualifiers in the two All-Ireland quarter-finals. In the semi-finals, the Leinster and Munster champions play the winners of the two quarter finals. The final normally takes place on the first Sunday in September. ===Non- participating Provincial Championships=== Connacht and Ulster teams can compete in the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship (tier 1) by gaining promotion through the tiers of hurling \u2013 the Christy Ring Cup (tier 2), the Nicky Rackard Cup (tier 3) and the Lory Meagher Cup (tier 4). Connacht Senior Hurling Championship This competition is no longer organised. Galway represent Connacht and participate in the Leinster Championship. Ulster Senior Hurling Championship Although this competition takes place, it is not part of the All- Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. Currently no Ulster teams qualify to play in this year's Leinster championship which means that winning the Christy Ring cup is their only route into this year's All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. == Summary == === Championships === === Other Championship Tiers === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Level on Pyramid !Competition !Champions !Runners Up |- |Tier 1 |2017 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship |20x20px Galway |20x20px Waterford |- |Tier 1 (Leinster) |2017 Leinster Senior Hurling Championship |20x20px Galway |20x20px Wexford |- |Tier 1 (Munster) |2017 Munster Senior Hurling Championship |20x20px Cork |20x20px Clare |- |Tier 1 (Ulster) |2017 Ulster Senior Hurling Championship |20x20px Antrim |20x20px Armagh |- |Tier 2 |2017 Christy Ring Cup |20x20px Carlow |20x20px Antrim |- |Tier 3 |2017 Nicky Rackard Cup |20x20px Derry |20x20px Armagh |- |Tier 4 |2017 Lory Meagher Cup |20x20px Warwickshire |20x20px Leitrim |} == Leinster Senior Hurling Championship == === Leinster Format === Nine counties compete - seven from Leinster plus Galway and Kerry. Last year's Leinster champions receive a bye into the semi-final. The championship begins with a qualifier group involving the four weakest teams. The group winners and runners-up join four of the five strongest teams in the three Leinster quarter finals as the competition continues in a knock-out format. Two semi-finals and a final follow. === Leinster Qualifier Group === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" ! !

The remaining six teams (four seeded teams plus the qualifier group winners and runners-up) play in three quarter-finals. An informal system of promotion or relegation operates in this round; if a team from the qualifier group wins their quarter-final, they will be seeded in next year's Leinster championship and the beaten seeded team will compete in next year's Leinster qualifier group. Leinster Quarter-Finals ==== Leinster Semi- Finals ==== Last year's Leinster champions receive a bye into the semi-finals. They are joined by the winners of the three quarter-finals. ==== Leinster Final ==== == Munster Senior Hurling Championship == === Munster Format === Five of the six Munster counties participate. Kerry compete in the qualifier group of the Leinster championship. The competition is entirely knock-out. === Munster Quarter-Final === === Munster Semi-Finals === === Munster Final === ==All-Ireland Qualifiers== ===Qualifiers Overall Format=== A total of nine teams enter the qualifiers \u2013 five of the seven teams eliminated in Leinster before the final (three losing quarter-finalists and two losing semi- finalists), all three teams knocked-out in Munster before the final and the winners of 2017's Christy Ring Cup. The fixtures are decided by draws which are detailed in the sections below. All qualifier matches are knock-out and eventually result in two teams who progress to the two All-Ireland quarter- finals. ===Qualifiers Preliminary Round=== ====Qualifiers Preliminary Round Format==== The GAA congress held in Feb 2017 voted to allow the winners of the 2017 Christy Ring cup to enter the 2017 qualifiers in a new preliminary round. The Christy Ring cup winners play the losers of one of the three Leinster quarter finals. ====Qualifiers Preliminary Match==== ===Qualifiers Round 1=== ====Qualifiers Round 1 Format==== After the qualifiers preliminary round, the eight remaining qualifier teams play in four matches. A draw is made such that the three Munster teams are paired with three teams beaten in the Leinster championship. Teams who have already met in the Leinster championship cannot be drawn to meet again if such a pairing can be avoided. The draw was made on the morning of the 26 June. ====Qualifiers Round 1 Matches==== ===Qualifiers Round 2=== ====Qualifiers Round 2 Format==== The four winners of round 1 play in two matches.

Teams who have already met in the Leinster or Munster championships cannot be drawn to meet again if such a pairing can be avoided. This year, as Cork had met both Tipperary and Waterford in the Munster championship, a repeat pairing could not be avoided. The draw took place on 24 July to decide the fixtures. ===All-Ireland Final=== ==Championship Statistics== ===Top scorer overall=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Rank ! Player ! County ! Tally !
