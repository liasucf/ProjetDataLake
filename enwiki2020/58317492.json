    "text": "Mount Lico is an inselberg mountain in the Alto Molocue District of Zambezia Province in northern Mozambique, most notable for its old-growth rainforest and its lack of penetration by humans. Mount Lico is approximately above sea level but is distinctive in having sheer rock walls of up to above the surrounding countryside which have prevented almost all human intrusion. The forest on top, within a volcanic crater, covers only about . In 2012 Mt Lico was \"discovered\", or more correctly, identified as a place of special scientific interest, by Julian Bayliss of Oxford Brookes University, who had earlier similarly identified Mount Mabu some to the south-west, by using Google Earth to search for significant landforms and vegetation features. In May 2018, Bayliss led a multidisciplinary expedition to scale the sheer walls of Mount Lico and begin the study of its unique habitat. Although it had been considered unlikely that humans would have entered the mountain's forest prior to this expedition, evidence of some limited human visitation was discovered in the form of several pots which had been placed, possibly for religious reasons, at the source of a stream on the mountain top. ==See also== *Afromontane *Mount Mabu ==References== ==External links== * Audio: Exploring a hidden rainforest on an isolated mountain in Mozambique * Why we explored an undisturbed rainforest hidden on top of an African mountain * Lico: Mountain of Mystery * The story of an expedition into an unexplored forest... * Scientists are exploring a lost rainforest hidden in a Mozambique volcano for the first time * Mozambique: the secret rainforest at the heart of an African volcano * The Secret Garden: How Google Earth led a team of scientists to discover an untouched mountaintop rainforest * Mongabay: Secrets revealed: Researchers explore unique, isolated forest in Mozambique * Lonelyplanet: A hidden mountain rainforest has been uncovered using Google Earth * DMM Climbing: Monte Lico\u2019s rainforest \u2018lost world\u2019 * BBC News Mundo: El cient\u00edfico que descubri\u00f3 gracias a Google Earth un bosque rec\u00f3ndito a m\u00e1s de 8.000 kil\u00f3metros de distancia de su casa (Spanish) * Julian Bayliss: Mount Lico photos (Feb17, Nov17, May18 expedition) * Outthere.fr: Comment Google Earth permet de faire d\u2019incroyables d\u00e9couvertes naturelles (French) * The man who discovered an unseen world Lico Category:Alto Molocue District Lico Lico Category:Inselbergs of Africa ",
