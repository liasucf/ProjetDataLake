    "text": "In mathematics, a nonlocal operator is a mapping which maps functions on a topological space to functions, in such a way that the value of the output function at a given point cannot be determined solely from the values of the input function in any neighbourhood of any point. An example of a nonlocal operator is the Fourier transform. ==Formal definition== Let X be a topological space, Y a set, F(X) a function space containing functions with domain X, and G(Y) a function space containing functions with domain Y. Two functions u and v in F(X) are called equivalent at x\\in X if there exists a neighbourhood N of x such that u(x')=v(x') for all x'\\in N. An operator A: F(X) \\to G is said to be local if for every y\\in Y there exists an x\\in X such that Au(y) = Av(y) for all functions u and v in F(X) which are equivalent at x. A nonlocal operator is an operator which is not local. For a local operator it is possible (in principle) to compute the value Au(y) using only knowledge of the values of u in an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of a point x. For a nonlocal operator this is not possible. ==Examples== Differential operators are examples of local operators. A large class of (linear) nonlocal operators is given by the integral transforms, such as the Fourier transform and the Laplace transform. For an integral transform of the form : (Au)(y) = \\int \\limits_X u(x)\\, K(x, y)\\, dx, where K is some kernel function, it is necessary to know the values of u almost everywhere on the support of K(\\cdot, y) in order to compute the value of Au at y. An example of a singular integral operator is the fractional Laplacian : (-\\Delta)^sf(x) = c_{d,s} \\int\\limits_{\\mathbb{R}^d} \\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{|x-y|^{d+2s}}\\,dy. The prefactor c_{d,s} := \\frac{4^s\\Gamma(d/2+s)}{\\pi^{d/2}|\\Gamma(-s)|} involves the Gamma function and serves as a normalizing factor. The fractional Laplacian plays a role in, for example, the study of nonlocal minimal surfaces. ==Applications== Some examples of applications of nonlocal operators are: *Time series analysis using Fourier transformations *Analysis of dynamical systems using Laplace transformations *Image denoising using non-local means *Modelling Gaussian blur or motion blur in images using convolution with a blurring kernel or point spread function ==See also== *Fractional calculus *Linear map *Nonlocal Lagrangian *Action at a distance ==References== == External links == *Nonlocal equations wiki Category:Mathematical analysis Category:Functions and mappings ",
