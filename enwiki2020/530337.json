    "text": "Abu Mansur Ali ibn Ahmad Asadi Tusi () was a Persian poet, linguist and author. He was born at the beginning of the 11th century in Tus, Iran, in the province of Khorasan, and died in the late 1080s in Tabriz. Asadi Tusi is considered an important Persian poet of the Iranian national epics. His best- known work is Garshaspnameh, written in the style of the Shahnameh. == Life == Little is known about Asadi's life. Most of the Khorasan province was under violent attack by Turkish groups; many intellectuals fled, and those who remained generally lived in seclusion. Asadi spent his first twenty years in \u1e6c\u016bs. From about 1018 to 1038 AD, he was a poet at the court of the Daylamite Ab\u016b Na\u1e63r Jast\u0101n. Here, in 1055\u201356, Asadi copied Ab\u016b Man\u1e63\u016br Mowaffaq Herav\u012b's Ket\u0101b al-abn\u012ba al-adw\u012ba. He later went to Nakhjavan and completed his seminal work, the Garsh\u0101sp-nama (dedicated to Abu Dolaf, ruler of Nakhjavan), in 1065\u20131066. Asadi then served at the court of the Shaddadid king Manuchehr, who ruled Ani. The poet's tomb is in the city of Tabriz. == Works == Asadi's most significant work is Garsh\u0101sp-nama (The Book [or Epic] of Garsh\u0101sp). His other important contribution is a lexicon of the modern Persian language (). Five of Asadi's Mon\u0101\u1e93ar\u0101t () (Debates in the form of poetry between two people or objects or concepts) also still exist. === Garshaspnama (The Epic of Garsh\u0101sp) === The Garshaspnama () epic, with 9,000 couplets, is Asadi Tusi's major work. The hero of the poem is Garshasp (father of Kariman and great-grandfather of \u0160am), identified in the Shahnameh with the ancient Iranian hero K\u0259r\u0259s\u0101spa- (Avestan language). In Avestan he was the son of \u0398rita- of the Yama clan. The poet adapted the story from a book, The Adventures of Garsh\u0101sp, saying that it complements the stories of the Shahnameh; although the poem was part of folklore, it was based on written sources. The poem begins with Yama (or Jamshid), the father of Garsh\u0101sp, who was overthrown by Zahhak and flees to Ghurang, king of Zabulistan (near modern Quetta). In Zabulistan, Jamshid falls in love with the king's daughter and she gives birth to Garsh\u0101sp. Jamshid is forced to flee. When Garsh\u0101sp's mother poisons herself, he spends much of his life with his grandfather and grows up to be a warrior like Jamshid. After Ghurang's death Zahhak was to become king, although the secret remains until the birth of Kariman. Zahhak, as king, visits Z\u0101bulist\u0101n and challenges the young Garsh\u0101sp to slay a dragon. Equipped with an antidote to dragon poison and armed with special weapons, Garsh\u0101sp kills the monster. Impressed with the child's prowess, Zahh\u0101k sends Garsh\u0101sp to India, where the king (a vassal of Zahh\u0101k's) has been replaced by the rebel prince Bahu (who does not acknowledge Zahh\u0101k's rule). Garsh\u0101sp defeats the rebel and remains in India to observe its marvels and engage in philosophical discourse. He then goes to Sarandib (Ceylon), where he sees the footprint of the Buddha (in Muslim sources, identified with the footprint of Adam). Asadi then recounts many legends about Adam, the father of mankind. Garshasp then meets a Brahman, whom he questions in detail about philosophy and religion. The words Asadi Tusi attributes to the Brahman relate to his Islamic neo-Platonism. Garshasp later visits Indian islands and sees supernatural wonders, which are described at great length. The hero returns home and pays homage to Zahak. He woos a princess of Rum, restores her father (E\u1e6fre\u1e6d) to his throne in Z\u0101bol after his defeat by the King of K\u0101bol and builds the city of Sist\u0101n. He has anachronistic adventures in the Mediterranean, fighting in Kairouan and C\u00f3rdoba. In the West, he meets a \"Greek Brahman\" and engages in philosophical discourse with the wise man. When he returns to Iran his father dies, and Garsh\u0101sp becomes king of Z\u0101bolest\u0101n. Although he has no son of his own, he adopts Nar\u0113m\u0101n (Rostam's great-grandfather) as his heir. At this time Fer\u0113d\u016bn defeats Zahak and becomes king of Iran, and Garsh\u0101sp swears allegiance to him. Garsh\u0101sp and his nephew then go to Turan and defeat the Faghf\u016br of Chin (an Iranian title for the ruler of Central Asia and China, probably of Sogdian origin), bringing him as a captive to Fer\u0113d\u016bn. Garsh\u0101sp fights a final battle with the king of Tanger, slaying another dragon before he returns to Sist\u0101n in Z\u0101bolest\u0101n and dies. === Lo\u1e21at-e fors (Khorasani Persian dictionary) === The dictionary was written to familiarize the people of Arran and Iranian Azerbaijan with unfamiliar phrases in Eastern Persian (Dar\u012b) poetry. It is the oldest existing Persian dictionary based on examples from poetry, and contains fragments of lost literary works such as Kalila and Dimna by Rudaki and Vamiq and 'Adhra by Unsuri. A variety of manuscripts exist in Iran and elsewhere; the oldest (1322) may be at the Malek Library in Tehran, although the one written in Safina-yi Tabriz is also from the same period. === Mon\u0101\u1e93ar\u0101t (debates) === Five debates survive in the Persian poetic form of qasida. Although qasida is unprecedented in Arabic or New Persian, it is part of the Middle Persian (Pahlavi) tradition. The Pahlavic poetic debate Draxt i Asurik indicates the history of this form of debate. The surviving debates are Arab o 'Ajam (The Arab vs. the Persian), Mogh o Mosalman (The Zoroastian vs. the Muslim), Shab o Ruz (Night vs. Day), Neyza o Kaman (Spear vs. Bow) and Asman o Zamin (Sky vs. Earth). The Persian wins the Persian-versus-Arab debate, while the Muslim defeats the Zoroastrian. ==See also== *Persian literature *List of Persian poets and authors *Nozhat al-Majales ==References== ==Further reading== *Encyclopedia Iranica, \"Asadi Tusi\", Dj.
