    "text": "Saint Veranus of Cavaillon (, Vrain; ) (died c. 590) was a French saint, with a cultus in Italy. He was born at Vaucluse and was bishop of Cavaillon. Gregory of Tours writes of miracles performed by Veranus, including the expulsion of a dragon. He is also remembered as a leader in charitable works and as a patron of local monasteries, not only in France but also in Italy, particularly in the city of Albenga, where he was instrumental in the conversion of the people to Christianity. In the early 11th century some of his relics were transferred from his place of burial to Orl\u00e9ans. In the 13th century most were transferred again, to Cavaillon Cathedral, which is dedicated to him, but some were sent to Albenga Cathedral in Liguria, where they are still preserved in a shrine. ==Placenames== The French village of Saint-V\u00e9ran is named after him.In the U.S., localities seemingly dedicated to the saint, such as Fort Saint Vrain, Colorado, and St. Vrain, New Mexico, as well as the St. Vrain Creek in Colorado, are mostly derived from Ceran St. Vrain (May 5, 1802 - October 28, 1870), co-founder of the Bent-St. Vrain Company. In Fontaine de Vaucluse there is a church called after the Saint. It was the place of his birth and in the small church there is a tomb reputed to be that of the Saint. ==Notes== ==External links== *Musee de Conte *Santiebeati.it: San Verano di Cavaillon *Saint of the Day, October 19: Veranus of Cavaillon at SaintPatrickDC.org *Catholic Online: Veranus Category:Bishops of Cavaillon Category:6th-century bishops Category:590 deaths Category:6th-century Frankish saints Category:Year of birth unknown ",
