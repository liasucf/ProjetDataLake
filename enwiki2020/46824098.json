This book was updated by Jane Elliott (academic) in 2008. The Cathie Marsh Institute for Social Research (CMIST) at the University of Manchester was named after her. The computing room in her old faculty at the University of Cambridge, SPS, Faculty of Human, Social, and Political Science, University of Cambridge, was renamed the Cathie Marsh Machine Room after her death. ==References== Category:British sociologists Category:British statisticians Category:Women sociologists Category:Women statisticians Category:1951 births Category:1993 deaths ",
