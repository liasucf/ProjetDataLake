Some skits from the show were shown around the internet months before the show premiered. The skits caused a mixed reaction from the fans of Eric's previous TV series Celebrity Deathmatch, which he left to work on this show. The response from critics was mostly positive. For example, Variety said: \"Starveillance isn't the kind of concept likely to have significant staying power, but it feels like a logical step for E! as the channel seeks to branch out beyond its limited reality-TV profile into somewhat more ambitious fare -- the kind of show whose best moments are tailor-made to be sliced, diced and repurposed on YouTube.\" - Brian Lowry, Variety ==Syndication== Teen channel The N aired the episodes from April 11, 2009 to May 16, 2009. ==External links== * *Starveillance MySpace Category:2000s American adult animated television series Category:2000s American satirical television series Category:2007 American television series debuts Category:2007 American television series endings Category:2000s Canadian adult animated television series Category:2000s Canadian satirical television series Category:2007 Canadian television series debuts Category:2007 Canadian television series endings Category:American adult animated comedy television series Category:Canadian adult animated comedy television series Category:American stop-motion adult animated television series Category:Canadian stop-motion animated television series Category:Crossover animated television series Category:English-language television shows Category:E! original programming Category:American parody television series Category:Television series by Cuppa Coffee Studios Category:Television series created by Eric Fogel ",
