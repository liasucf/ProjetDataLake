    "text": "George Theodore Berthon's Francis Gore Francis Gore, (Blackheath, London 1769 - 3 November 1852) was an English officer and British colonial administrator. Gore was commissioned into the 44th Foot in 1787, but transferred to the 54th Foot in 1794 and the 17th Light Dragoons in 1795. He retired with the rank of major and became Governor of Bermuda from 1805 to 1806, and then Lieutenant- Governor of Upper Canada from 1806 to 1811. Gore's administration built roads, reorganised the militia and founded schools. He was absent on leave during the War of 1812 as military authorities ran the province. His stand-in during this time was Isaac Brock, who \"sought an active role in the impending war as keenly as Gore sought to escape it\". Gore resumed his role as lieutenant- governor from 1815 to 1817. During his second term, Gore prorogued the Legislative Assembly after it challenged his ban on issuing land grants to American refugees and made other criticisms of his administration. Robert MacIntosh, in his book Earliest Toronto, describes Gore as \"a man who was clearly the most incompetent and disliked Lieutenant Governor in the history of Upper Canada\". Gore Vale, a north\u2013south street on the eastern boundary of Trinity Bellwoods Park on the west side of downtown Toronto, is named after him. Gore left Canada after his posting in 1817 and died in Brighton, England, on 3 November 1852. Most historians believe that the township municipality of Gore, Quebec, was named after him. ==References== == External links == * Category:1769 births Category:1852 deaths Category:54th Regiment of Foot officers Category:17th Lancers officers Category:Lieutenant-Governors of Upper Canada Category:People from Blackheath, London Category:Governors of Bermuda Category:44th Regiment of Foot officers ",
