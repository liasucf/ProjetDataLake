    "text": "The John D. Hart House is a historic home in Pennington, New Jersey built ca. 1800. It is an example of a clapboard house from Mercer County. Its builder is presumed to be a relation, perhaps a nephew, of John Hart, who was a signer of the Declaration of Independence and lived in nearby Hopewell. The house is notable for its similarity to the John White House in Lawrenceville. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Mercer County, New Jersey ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Mercer County, New Jersey Category:Houses in Mercer County, New Jersey Category:Pennington, New Jersey Category:New Jersey Register of Historic Places ",
