    "text": "The Geul (Dutch; in , in ) is a river in Belgium and in the Netherlands, where it is a right-bank tributary to the river Meuse. The source of the Geul is at about above sea level in northeastern Belgium near the German border, south of the German town of Aachen. From there, after flowing some in a northwestern direction, it leaves Belgium and enters the Netherlands at Cotessen in the Vaals municipality. After a further in a west-northwestern direction through the most southern part of Limburg, which in its turn is the most southern province of the Netherlands, it flows into the Meuse, north of the city of Maastricht. A tributary of the Geul is the Gulp. Places through which the Geul passes are among others Kelmis (Belgium), Valkenburg aan de Geul and Meerssen (Netherlands). ==Pollution== The water of the Geul is polluted seriously with heavy metals zinc and lead and as a result also is a serious source of heavy metal inflow into the Meuse. This pollution is a result of former zinc and lead mining activities near the Belgian towns of Kelmis (La Calamine) and Plombi\u00e8res (formerly named Bleiberg). The last ones of these mines have closed early in the 20th century. One of the reasons for giving up mining activities in Plombi\u00e8res was the occasional flooding of the mine by the Geul, as the bedrock (mainly Carboniferous limestone) contains many faults and fissures. Although mine factory buildings have been demolished, old railway dikes still are abundantly present in the area. They provide ideal hiking routes, that are known for the presence of so-called \"zinc flora\" (zinc-tolerant plants, such as yellow calamine violet and Viola calaminaria). ==Gallery== File:Kelmis Tueljebach - Geul.jpg|At Kelmis Tueljebach File:Schin op Geul-Geul- Schoonbron-1.JPG|At Schin op Geul File:Geul bij Strabeek Limburg.jpg|At Strabeek File:Geul voulwammes.jpg|Estuary at Voulwammes ==References== Category:International rivers of Europe Category:Rivers of the Ardennes (Belgium) Category:Rivers of Belgium Category:Rivers of the Netherlands Category:Rivers of Li\u00e8ge (province) Category:Rivers of South Limburg (Netherlands) Category:Gulpen-Wittem Category:Kelmis Category:Meerssen Category:Plombi\u00e8res Category:Raeren Category:Valkenburg aan de Geul ",
