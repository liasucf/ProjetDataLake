The monument was erected in 1905 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. At the base are the busts of four Confederate generals -- Robert E. Lee, P. G. T. Beauregard, Stonewall Jackson and Henry Watkins Allen -- and it is topped by a statue of a Confederate soldier. The monument also includes a statue of Greek mythology figure Clio, who is pointing to the word \"Love\" on the monument and holding a scroll with the word \"History.\" The monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. In 2017, the Caddo Parish Commission voted to remove the monument. In August 2019, the commission asked the United Daughters of the Confederacy to remove it within 90 days.} In July 2020, with the monument still not removed, the Caddo Parish Commission voted to build a box around the monument. On July 21, 2020, the United Daughters of the Confederacy agreed to allow the parish to move the monument to private land. ==See also== * List of Confederate monuments and memorials * National Register of Historic Places listings in Caddo Parish, Louisiana ==References== Category:Confederate States of America monuments and memorials in Louisiana ",
