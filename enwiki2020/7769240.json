    "text": "Sylt Frisian, or S\u00f6l'ring, is the dialect of the North Frisian language spoken on the island of Sylt in the German region of North Frisia. S\u00f6l'ring refers to the S\u00f6l'ring Frisian word for Sylt, S\u00f6l. Together with the Fering, \u00d6\u00f6mrang, and Heligolandic dialects, it forms part of the insular group of North Frisian dialects. It differs from the mainland dialects because of its relatively strong Danish influence. Due to mass tourism on Sylt, the dialect has been largely displaced by forms of German and S\u00f6l'ring is spoken only by a few hundred people, many of whom no longer reside on Sylt. Although it is taught in several primary schools, its prospects for survival are unfavorable compared with other insular dialects. ==Sample text== {| class=\"wikitable\" | S\u00f6l'ring | English |- | \u00dc\u00fcs S\u00f6l\u2019ring L\u00f6n\u2019, d\u00fc best \u00fc\u00fcs helig; D\u00fc blefst \u00fc\u00fcs ain, d\u00fc best \u00fc\u00fcs Lek!
