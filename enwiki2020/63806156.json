    "text": "Conophytum obcordellum is a species of flowering plant in the family Aizoaceae, native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is a small clump- forming succulent, growing to 10cm tall and 1m broad, forming glossy grey pebble-shaped growths, heavily marked with dots and lines. Daisy-like, silky white or pink night-scented flowers are borne on mature plants in Spring (or late Summer in the Northern Hemisphere). Conophytum obcordellum is cultivated as an ornamental. In temperate zones it must normally be grown under glass, as it does not tolerate freezing temperatures. Plants require similar conditions to cactus plants, grown in free-draining medium with full sun and low moisture levels. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. ==References== obcordellum Category:Succulent plants Category:Flora of the Cape Provinces ",
