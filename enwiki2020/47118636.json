    "text": "The Palmip\u00e8de was an early steamboat created in 1774 by French engineer and inventor Marquis Claude de Jouffroy . It was tested in June and July 1776 on the Doubs river between Besan\u00e7on and Montb\u00e9liard and thus became the first steam-powered vessel. The boat was driven by a Newcomen steam engine and was the predecessor of the Pyroscaphe, also made by Jouffroy. It had a length of 13 m (42 ft). The steamboat was not considered a success due to its lower than desired speed, which led to the development of the first paddle steamer.Dalton, Anthony. \"Introduction.\" Fire Canoes: Steamboats on Great Canadian Rivers.
