    "text": "Sonja Kehler (2 February 1933 \u2013 18 January 2016) was a German actress and chanson singer, known internationally for her interpretation of works by Bertolt Brecht, first playing his characters on the theatre stage, then focused on singing his songs and those of others in solo programs. She also taught acting in Danish at the theatre academy in Odense, appeared in films, worked as stage director and presented literary programs. == Career == Born in Haldensleben, Kehler first studied Romance languages, planning to become a theatre critic. When she played a small role in a student theatre project, she was called by the Theaterhochschule Leipzig. She studied acting there and performed at several theatres in East Germany, playing for example Luise in Schiller's Kabale und Liebe, Shen Te in Brecht's Der gute Mensch von Sezuan and Grusche in his Der kaukasische Kreidekreis. She also turned to musical theatre as Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady and Seer\u00e4uber-Jenny in the Dreigroschenoper. She was a member of theatres in Brandenburg and Karl-Marx- Stadt. The musical parts in Brecht's plays led to her singing chansons, during her student years when she was called \"singende Schauspielerin\" (the singing actress). She took part in the first chanson competition in the GDR in 1967 and was awarded the special prize \"Sonderpreis des Rundfunks\". In 1971 she performed her first Brecht programme, singing settings by Paul Dessau, Hanns Eisler, Tilo Medek and Kurt Weill. Her recordings also appeared in West Germany and internationally. She turned to singing chansons in several languages. Tours took her to Algeria, Austria and most European countries including Belgium, Denmark, England, Finland, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. From the mid 1980s, she taught at the drama school at Odense Teater in Denmark. After gaining fluency in Danish, she performed at Team Teatret, Herning, and Folketeatret, Copenhagen, remaining attached to Denmark for some 30 years. There she is remembered in particular for singing \"Den sidste turist i Europa\" (The Last Tourist in Europe) in Lars von Trier's film The Element of Crime\". After the German Reunification, she also worked as a stage director at the Exzellenzhaus Trier and presented literary programmes on authors such as Brecht, K\u00e4stner, Tucholsky, Ringelnatz, Heinrich Heine and Else Lasker- Sch\u00fcler, often with the pianist Milan \u0160amko.
