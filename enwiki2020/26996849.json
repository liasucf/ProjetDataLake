Patrick Weston Joyce said the name Beanntra\u00ed means \"descendants of Beann [Ban]\", a son of Conchobar mac Nessa; similarly for the Wexford barony of Bantry. The barony borders the top end the southern shore of Bantry Bay. On the opposite shore is the barony of Bear. It is also bordered by Carbery West (West Division to the south and East Division to the southeast), and Muskerry West to the northeast. To the north is County Kerry. ==Legal context== Baronies were created after the Norman invasion of Ireland as divisions of counties and were used the administration of justice and the raising of revenue. While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they have been administratively obsolete since 1898. However, they continue to be used in land registration and in specification, such as in planning permissions. In many cases, a barony corresponds to an earlier Gaelic t\u00faath which had submitted to the Crown. ==Settlements== Settlements include the town of BantryBantry: towns and BallylickeyBantry: population centres and Kilkeel. ==Geography== * Whiddy IslandBantry: islands and archipelagos == See also == * List of civil parishes of County Cork * List of townlands of the barony of Bantry in County Cork ==References== From : From other sources: Category:Baronies of County Cork ",
