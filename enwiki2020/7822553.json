It has an established history of church-planting as well as providing educational, medical and social services in Singapore and the neighbouring region. The Diocese of Singapore is in communion with the See of Canterbury. St Andrew's Cathedral is the cathedral church of the diocese. Currently, the diocese is headed by the bishop and former vicar of St John-St Margaret Church, the Right Reverend Rennis Ponniah. ==Diocesan coat of arms== The coat of arms of the Diocese of Singapore which belongs to the category of ecclesiastical heraldry, consists of a mitre surmounted on a St Andrew's Shield. The mitre symbolises apostolic authority and divine endorsement to govern the Anglican diocese in the region. The crozier symbolises the bishop's episcopate and the key represents the access to heaven. Emblazoned upon the St Andrew's Shield are four bunches of wheat symbolising the harvest fields which God has entrusted to the diocese. ==History== After falling under jurisdiction of the bishop of Labuan and Sarawak (and no longer Calcutta) in 1869, St. Andrew's Cathedral was made the cathedral church of the diocese in 1870. Officially titled Diocese of Singapore, Labuan and Sarawak in 1881, a diocese over such a large area was quite unmanageable. In 1909 Singapore was made a separate diocese covering the Straits Settlements, Peninsular Malaya, Siam, Java, Sumatra and adjacent islands, with Bishop Charles J. Ferguson-Davie as the first bishop of the diocese. On 6 February 1960, it was renamed to Diocese of Singapore and Malaya. On 8 April 1970, the diocese was dissolved and split into Diocese of Singapore and Diocese of West Malaysia. ==Parishes== As of 2018, there are 27 Anglican parishes in the diocese: *St Andrew's Cathedral *All Saints' Church *Chapel of Christ the King *Chapel of Christ the Redeemer *Chapel of the Holy Spirit *Chapel of the Resurrection *Church of Our Saviour *Church of the Ascension *Church of the Epiphany *Church of the Good Shepherd *Church of the True Light *Holy Trinity Parish *Light of Christ Church Woodlands *Marine Parade Christian Centre *My Saviour's Church *Parish of Christ Church (Tamil) *St Andrew\u2019s City Church *St Andrew's Community Chapel *St George's Church *St Hilda's Church *St James' Church *St John's Chapel *St John's\u2013St Margaret's Church *St Matthew's Church *St Paul's Church *St Peter's Church *Yishun Christian Church (Anglican) ==Deaneries== There are six deaneries in the Diocese of Singapore: *Cambodia *Laos *Indonesia *Nepal *Thailand *Vietnam A dean oversees the mission work in each deanery and regularly reports to the director of missions of the Diocese of Singapore. ==Schools== Anglican schools in Singapore: *Anglican High School *Christ Church Secondary School *Saint Hilda's Primary School *Saint Hilda's Secondary School *St. Margaret's Primary School *St. Margaret's Secondary School *Saint Andrew's Junior School *St. Andrew's Secondary School *St. Andrew's Junior College *St. Andrew's Autism School Additionally, there are five kindergartens and six childcare centres as of 2020: * Kindergartens * Ascension Kindergarten * Queenstown Good Shepherd Kindergarten * St. Hilda's Kindergarten * St. James' Church Kindergarten * St. Paul's Church Kindergarten * * Childcare Centres * Ascension Kindercare - A Little Seeds Preschool * Kiddy Ark Kindercare - A Little Seeds Preschool * Praiseland Kindercare - A Little Seeds Preschool * Sonshine Kindercare - A Little Seeds Preschool * St. Andrew's Kindercare - A Little Seeds Preschool * St. James' Kindercare - A Little Seeds Preschool * ==Medical services== St Andrew's Community Hospital, Simei The St Andrew's Mission Hospital (SAMH) is a non-profit voluntary welfare organisation under the Diocese of Singapore.
