It forms a parallel street to Packhusgr\u00e4nd and Norra Bankogr\u00e4nd. The alley appears in historical records as Tollhuus grenden in 1626, stora Tullhus gr\u00e4nden in 1693, Store Si\u00f6tullsgr\u00e4nden in 1704, Stora Tull gr[\u00e4nd] in 1733, and finally as Tullgr\u00e4nd in 1885. The name is derived from Tullhuset (\"the Customs Building\") located in the block north of the alley in 1686, and the warehouse built in the 1780s. By the early 18th century, the alley was known as Solgr\u00e4nden (\"The Sun Alley\") after the tavern Lilla Solen (\"The Small Sun\") which was located there (see also Packhusgr\u00e4nd and Solgr\u00e4nd.) == See also == * List of streets and squares in Gamla stan == References == == External links == * hitta.se - Location map Category:Streets in Stockholm ",
