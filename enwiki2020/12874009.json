In 1989, KWYD-FM was sold to Optima Communications which flipped the station to a new-age music/smooth jazz format as KBZE, using the on-air moniker \"The Breeze.\" (On October 31, 2008 the KWYD- FM call letters were picked up by a radio station in Boise, Idaho, which broadcasts a rhythmic contemporary format.) Two years later, the call letters and format were changed again. The station became a country outlet with the call sign KHII, using the on-air handle \"K-High.\" Optima Communications entered into a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Pikes Peak Broadcasting Company to operate the station in 1993. In the fall of 1996, Pikes Peak flipped the station back to a smooth jazz format. This time it was called \"Sax 105.5\" and adopted the KSKX call letters. The station remained smooth jazz until News Press & Gazette (NPG) took over the management of the station for a News/Talk format as KRDO-FM in August 2006. In 2015, Optima Communications sold KRDO-FM to NPG. ==KRDO-FM call sign history== The KRDO-FM call letters had previously been used on 95.1 MHz in the Colorado Springs radio market, the original sister station to AM 1240 KRDO. That FM station signed on in 1969 broadcasting a beautiful music format. In 1994 KRDO-FM dropped easy listening music and flipped to adult contemporary music, using the moniker \"Peak 95.1.\" In 1998 Peak 95.1 evolved into a Hot AC format which it maintained until Citadel Broadcasting (now Cumulus Media) took over operations of the station in the early 2000s. When the Cumulus-owned station gave up the KRDO-FM call letters in 2006, Pikes Peak Broadcasting acquired that call sign for 105.5. The 95.1 frequency is now home to Cat Country 95.1 KATC-FM. ==References== ==External links== * RDO-FM Category:News-Press & Gazette Company Category:Radio stations established in 1973 Category:1973 establishments in Colorado Category:Denver Broncos broadcasters ",
