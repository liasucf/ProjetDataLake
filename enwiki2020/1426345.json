Within three years, it became an independent city. In the early 1920s, streetcars ran from Ocean View in Norfolk, to South Norfolk. There was a ferry that docked at the end of Indian River Road and crossed the Southern Branch Elizabeth River to Portsmouth. The much larger independent city of Norfolk expanded rapidly into the adjacent communities after World War II. In 1963, after a referendum in South Norfolk and Norfolk County and with approval from the Virginia General Assembly, South Norfolk and Norfolk County merged to form the independent city of city of Chesapeake in 1963. The new name was also selected through a voter referendum. ==Revitalization== The Gateway at SoNo was the city's first major redevelopment project generated by the city's South Norfolk Revitalization Plan. When completed, The Gateway at SoNo, which will span , will feature 133 condominiums and loft apartments as well as of retail and office space. Harris-Judah LLC, the builder/developer behind The Gateway at SoNo, has announced that affordable, single family homes are available in Chesapeake's South Norfolk area.
