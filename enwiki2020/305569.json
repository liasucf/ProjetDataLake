There has been much confusion over whether McKay was born in 1889 or 1890. His birth certificate lists 1889. McKay asserted that he was born in 1890 and, in a letter to Alain Locke, directly rejected the claim of 1889. \u2013 May 22, 1948) was a Jamaican writer and poet, and was a central figure in the Harlem Renaissance. He wrote five novels: Home to Harlem (1928), a best-seller that won the Harmon Gold Award for Literature, Banjo (1929), Banana Bottom (1933), Romance in Marseille (published in 2020), and in 1941 a manuscript called Amiable With Big Teeth: A Novel of the Love Affair Between the Communists and the Poor Black Sheep of Harlem which remained unpublished until 2017.Felicia R. Lee, \"New Novel of Harlem Renaissance Is Found\", The New York Times, September 14, 2012. McKay also authored collections of poetry, a collection of short stories, Gingertown (1932), two autobiographical books, A Long Way from Home (1937) and My Green Hills of Jamaica (published posthumously in 1979), and a non-fiction, socio-historical treatise entitled Harlem: Negro Metropolis (1940). His 1922 poetry collection, Harlem Shadows, was among the first books published during the Harlem Renaissance. His Selected Poems was published posthumously, in 1953. McKay was attracted to communism in his early life, but he always asserted that he never became an official member of the Communist Party USA. However, some scholars dispute that claim, noting his close ties to active members, his attendance at communist-led events, and his months-long stay in the Soviet Union in 1922-23, which he wrote about very favorably.Tyrone Tillery, Claude McKay: A Black Poet's Struggle for Identity. University of Massachusetts Press, 1992, pp. 64\u201365, 68\u201370. He gradually became disillusioned with communism, however, and by the mid-1930s had begun to write negatively about it.Wayne F. Cooper, Claude McKay: Rebel Sojourner in the Harlem Renaissance, Louisiana State University Press, 1987, pp. 294\u2013295. By the late 1930s his anti-Stalinism isolated him from other Harlem intellectuals,Shlomo Katz, \"From a Russian Shtetl to the Founding of Midstream.\" Midstream, June/July 1982, p. 33. and by 1942 he converted to Catholicism and left Harlem, and he worked for a Catholic organization until his death.\"Claude McKay\", Encyclopedia Britannica. Last updated September 11, 2018. Retrieved October 9, 2018. ==Early life in Jamaica == Festus Claudius McKay, known as Claude McKay, was born September 15, 1889 or 1890 in Nairne Castle near James Hill in upper Clarendon Parish, Jamaica. He referred to his home village as Sunny Ville, a name given to the area by locals. He was the youngest child of Thomas Francis McKay and Hannah Ann Elizabeth Edwards, well-to-do farmers who had enough property to qualify to vote. He had seven siblings. McKay's parents were active and well-respected members of the Baptist faith. Thomas was a strict, religious man who struggled to develop close relationships with his children due to his serious nature. In contrast, Hannah had a warmth that allowed her to give love freely to all of her children. Thomas was of Ashanti descent, while Hannah traced her ancestry to Madagascar. Claude recounted that his father would often share stories of Ashanti customs with the family.Tillery, Tyrone. Claude Mckay : A Black Poet's Struggle for Identity. University of Massachusetts Press, 1992. At the age of four, McKay went to school at Mt. Zion Church. Around the age of nine, he was sent to live with his oldest brother, Uriah Theodore, also known as U'Theo, a teacher, to be given a proper education. His brother also enjoyed being a journalist, even though he did not professionally do this for a living. Due to his brother's influence, McKay became an avid reader of classical and British literature, as well as philosophy, science and theology. With the time he had on his hands, he would read poems during that time and other material; a lot of material he read was William Shakespeare's work. When McKay was in elementary school, he became very intrigued and passionate about poetry, which he started to write at the age of 10. As a teenager in 1906, he became apprenticed to a carriage and cabinet maker known as Old Brenga, maintaining his apprenticeship for about two years. During that time, in 1907, McKay met a man named Walter Jekyll, who became a mentor and an inspiration for him, who also encouraged him to concentrate on his writing. Jekyll convinced McKay to write in his native dialect, and then set some of McKay's verses to music. Jekyll helped McKay publish his first book of poems, Songs of Jamaica, in 1912. These were the first poems published in Jamaican Patois (dialect of mainly English words and African structure). McKay's next volume, Constab Ballads (1912), was based on his experiences of joining the constabulary for a brief period in 1911.Freda Scott Giles, \"Claude McKay's Life\", Modern American Poetry. McKay's poem \"The Tropics in New York\" highlights his memory of the Caribbean. The poem takes place in New York, where he worked as a labor worker. The fruits in New York causes the speaker of the poem to feel nostalgic. The poem describes the many Caribbean fruits integrated into the New York \"cityscape,\" such as,\"alligator pears, mangoes, and tangerines\". The color of the fruits remind him of the colors and the diversity in Jamaica. He incorporates figurative language in order to; explain his longing for old ways. For example, the speaker describes how he is \"hungry for old familiar ways/ a wave of longing through my body wept\". He reminiscences on his life back home in Jamaica, which explains why he identifies with the many fruits sold on the New York city streets. ==First stay in the U. S. A.== McKay left for the U.S. in 1912 to attend Tuskegee Institute. He was shocked by the intense racism he encountered when he arrived in Charleston, South Carolina, where many public facilities were segregated; this inspired him to write more poetry. At Tuskegee, he disliked the \"semi-military, machine-like existence there\" and quickly left to study at Kansas State University. At Kansas State, he read W. E. B. Du Bois' Souls of Black Folk, which had a major impact on him and stirred his political involvement. But despite superior academic performance, in 1914 he decided he did not want to be an agronomist and moved to New York City, where he married his childhood sweetheart Eulalie Lewars. McKay published two poems in 1917 in The Seven Arts under the pseudonym Eli Edwards while working as a waiter on the railways. In 1919, he met Crystal and Max Eastman, who produced The Liberator (where McKay would serve as co- executive editor until 1922).The Chicago Defender (National edition) (1921\u20131967); April 2, 1921; ProQuest Historical Newspapers: Chicago Defender (1910-1975), p. 1. It was here, as the co-editor of The Liberator, that he published one of his most famous poems, \"If We Must Die\", during the \"Red Summer\", a period of intense racial violence against black people in Anglo- American societies. The poem was reportedly later quoted by Winston Churchill during World War II.According to David Freeman (\"Churchill quoted radical poet Claude McKay\"; originally published in Finest Hour 125, Winter 2004-025) , while Churchill may have been familiar with McKay's words there is no documented evidence of him citing the poem in any speech. The Churchill Centre and Museum at the Churchill War Rooms, London. In this period McKay joined the Industrial Workers of the World. He also became involved with a group of black radicals who were unhappy both with Marcus Garvey's nationalism and the middle-class reformist NAACP. These included other Caribbean writers such as Cyril Briggs, Richard B. Moore, and Wilfred Domingo. They fought for black self-determination within the context of socialist revolution. Together they founded the semi-secret revolutionary organization, the African Blood Brotherhood. Hubert Harrison had asked McKay to write for Garvey's Negro World, but only a few copies of the paper have survived from this period, none of which contain any articles by McKay. McKay soon left for London, England, writing later that it was to take advantage of an all-expense paid trip, but growing pressure from the Justice Department might also have played a part in his sudden decision to leave the country. ==Sojourn in the United Kingdom== In 1919, McKay arrived in London, where he would frequent two clubs, a soldiers' club in Drury Lane, and the International Socialist Club in Shoreditch. A militant atheist, he also joined the Rationalist Press Association. It was during this period that his commitment to socialism deepened and he read Marx assiduously. At the International Socialist Club, McKay met Shapurji Saklatvala, A. J. Cook, Guy Aldred, Jack Tanner, Arthur McManus, William Gallacher, Sylvia Pankhurst and George Lansbury. McKay was soon invited to write for Workers' Dreadnought. In April 1920, the Daily Herald, a socialist paper published by George Lansbury, included a racist article written by E. D. Morel. Entitled \"Black Scourge in Europe: Sexual Horror Let Loose by France on the Rhine\", it insinuated gross hypersexuality on black people in general. Lansbury refused to print McKay's response. This response then appeared in Workers' Dreadnought. In response to the \"Black Horror on the Rhine\" stories that the Daily Herald was running, McKay wrote: > Why this obscene maniacal outburst about the sex vitality of black men in a > proletarian paper?\" Rape is rape; the colour of the skin doesn't make it > different. Negroes are no more over-sexed than Caucasians; mulatto children > in the West Indies and America were not the result of parthenogenesis.

Bourbons of the United States will thank you, and the > proletarian underworld of London will certainly gloat over the scoop of the > Christian-Socialist pacifist Daily Herald.Reindeers, Robert, \"Racialism on > the Left: E.D. Morel and the 'Black Horror on the Rhine'\", International > Review of Social History, Volume 13, 1968 (pp. 1\u201328), p. 17. Since January 1920, McKay had been involved with the Workers' Dreadnought and the Workers' Socialist Federation, a Council Communist group active in the East End and which had a majority of women involved in it at all levels of the organization. He became a paid journalist for the paper; some people claim he was the first black journalist in Britain. He attended the Communist Unity Conference that established the Communist Party of Great Britain. At this time he also had some of his poetry published in the Cambridge Magazine, edited by C. K. Ogden. When Sylvia Pankhurst was arrested under the Defence of the Realm Act for publishing articles \"calculated and likely to cause sedition among His Majesty's forces, in the Navy, and among the civilian population,\" McKay had his rooms searched. He is likely to have been the author of \"The Yellow Peril and the Dockers\" attributed to \"Leon Lopez\", which was one of the articles cited by the government in its case against Workers' Dreadnought. ==Trip to Russia== McKay with Grigory Zinoviev and Nikolai Bukharin in 1923 When Russia was under the rule of Communist Party led by Lenin he was invited to Russia during the reconstruction of the country. In November 1922, in what he referred to as his \"Magic Pilgrimage,\" he traveled to Russia with Max Eastman to take part in the Fourth Congress of the Communist International in Petrograd and Moscow. McKay financed his trip to Russia by repackaging and selling Harlem Shadows, \"complete with a signed photograph and an inflated price tag\" to members of an NAACP donor list. He was greeted in Russia with an \"ecstatic welcome\" and \"rock-star treatment.\" A couple years later, McKay visited Russia again and when he arrived there was greeted with enthusiasm and friendliness. He was so well known in Russia that the brother of Nicholas the Second let him stay at his palace. People from all walks of life in Russia knew or heard of him and all had a desire or interest to learn what life was like for a Negro person in the United States. For example, soldiers in the Soviet army wanted to know what life was like for a Negro soldier in the United States military system and the Russian women were also interested of how well a Negro woman and white woman worked together. However, McKay also noticed life in Russia was very similar to the life of a Negro man in the United States. He noticed that people who were of a certain faith or religion were not given the same rights or opportunities as other people were able to receive. For example, people who practiced Judaism, were not allowed to apply for higher positions or jobs in the Soviet army. McKay also noticed that Russians had little understanding of why Negroes were treated so horribly in the United States and tried to enlighten them. ==Visit to Morocco== McKay wrote about his travels in Morocco in his 1937 autobiography A Long Way from Home. Before this journey he went to Paris, where he contracted a severe respiratory infection and required hospitalization. After recovering he continued traveling, and for 11 years ventured around Europe and parts of Northern Africa. During this stint he published three novels, and the most notable title from this period was Home to Harlem. This novel was published in 1928 where it was viewed various different ways. In The Negro Novel in America Robert Bone thought that it represented \"different ways of rebelling against Western civilization\", adding that McKay was not entirely successful in articulating his protagonists. However, other people thought that the novel provided a detailed portrayal of the underside of black urban life with its prostitutes and gamblers. Banana Bottom was another work he created during this 11-year span. Here McKay presented a clear depiction of his principal theme, that black individuals quest for cultural identity in a white society. Critics of the book all agreed that Banana Bottom is McKay's most skillful delineation of black individuals' predicament in white society. His final year abroad brought the creation of Gingertown, a collection of 12 short stories. Half of these tales depict his life in Harlem and the others revolve around his time in Jamaica. == Literary movements and traditions == Portrait of McKay in 1920 === Participation in Harlem Renaissance === McKay flourished as a poet during the Harlem Renaissance, a major literary movement in the 1920s. During this time, his poems challenged white authority while celebrating Jamaican culture. He also wrote tales about the trials and tribulations of life as a black man in both Jamaica and America. McKay was not secretive about his hatred for racism and felt that racist people were stupid and could not look past their shortsightedness and hatred. In tales such as Home to Harlem (1928), he depicts a culture in Harlem that is full of drug use, prostitution, and a variety of sexual encounters. His depiction was criticized as a negative portrayal of Harlem and its lower-class citizens by prominent figures such as W. E. B. DuBois, but was later applauded as a literary force in the Harlem Renaissance. McKay's poetry brought awareness to the racist treatment that many black individuals faced. One of his works that challenges racial discrimination in the Harlem Renaissance is his poem If We Must Die (1919). It looks to defend black rights and threatens for prejudice and abuse. He wanted his people to fight with determination and courage to those who would murder them. It calls to any race or anyone being discriminated against to fight for their freedom and what is right. What influenced him to write this poem was the clash between white and African Americans. McKay was afraid of the dangers that were happening all over the United States. The hangings, the shootings, the murders. Working as a porter on the railways, he would go from town to town not knowing what to expect. Some nights he would stay indoors because of the fear of danger going on outside. The creation of this poem had pushed him to become one of the most influential spokesman that promoted radicalism in America. McKay divested himself from many aspects and growing prescriptions of modernism. By the beginning of the 20th century, the sonnet form had become an antiquated poetic style, but McKay found it an ideal a medium to convey his ideas. Many modernists, however, rejected and criticized his use of the sonnet. Despite their reaction, he persevered and created a significant number of modern sonnets. Having spent time among the artists of Paris in the 1920s, he was intimately acquainted with the dynamics between painters and models and the manner in which modernist painters presented African subjects and African culture. In her article \"Caribbean Models for Modernism in the Work of Claude McKay and Jean Rhys\" Leah Rosenberg writes: \"The fascination with African art and its identification with female sexuality was characteristic of modernist and avant-garde primitivism\". The inclination to stereotype and caricature the African physical form created, however inadvertently, a form of hegemony reminiscent to McKay of the colonialism he grew up with in Jamaica. \"Sexuality and black culture,\" Rosenberg explains, \"held a privileged place in modernist and avant-garde art from Picasso to Gertrude Stein\". In need of money, McKay posed nude for the Cubist painter Andr\u00e9 Lhote. Through his experience, McKay saw first-hand how the larger social hegemony between European white supremacy and people of Afro-Caribbean descent could play itself out between the artist and its subject. McKay critically recalled the experience in various ways in many of his most notable works. In doing so, he shone a critical light on a cornerstone of modernism and once again pushed back against a system in which he found himself. == Political views and social activism == McKay joined the Industrial Workers of the World in autumn 1919, while working in a factory following his time as a dining-car waiter on the railways. According to his autobiographies A Long Way From Home and My Green Hills of Jamaica, he claimed he was drawn to the Communist party because it offered independence. McKay believed that the Communists in the US had other things on their agenda, and the African Americans were not part of that at all. Furthermore, he thought that they were using the Negro race to fight their battles. Because of his views on communism in America, he sought out help from Russia. McKay had seen and heard of the Russians' acceptance toward other communists and individuals, for their goal was to unite non-Europeans and normalize homosexual relationships, and felt a kinship to the movement. He addressed the Communists in Russia with his speech \"Report on the Negro Question\" and argued that America was not fully accepting of the Negro Communists. After his speech, he was asked by the Communist Party in Russia to explore this idea more in the form of a book. He wrote Negry v Amerike in 1923. He wrote this in Russian, and it was not translated into English until 1979. Later in life, he came to the conclusion that the Communist Party suppressed the idea of individuality and independent thought. Before coming back to America, he denounced the Communist thoughts, as documented in his autobiography A Long Way From Home. and looked for other areas to meet his needs. Past McKay's Communist ideologies, he engaged in activism through his literature that reached many countries and territories globally, with the city of Harlem, within the US, being especially effected by it. As a specific example, McKay urged the acceptance of strong African-American individuals as well as romantic relationships between homosexual couples within his novel Home to Harlem, which is the first in a series that follows the lives and experiences of black men with stable incomes and the courage to stand up for themselves and their beliefs. Through the eyes of one of the main characters those who read Home to Harlem can feel how much animosity McKay feels toward Harlem as the epicenter for African Americans. It is obvious that McKay sees Harlem as too complacent and submissive to the hetero-normative lifestyle and he wished for it to be a place all African American people, no matter the orientation, could live comfortably and happily. When broken down though, McKay worked toward equality and the welcoming of diversity within a population. With the concept of the new negro taking hold within America and beyond in the twenties, McKay wrote poems and prose to strengthen the movement and urge others to regard their race and sexuality as valid. == Sexuality == It is widely assumed that McKay was bisexual, as he pursued relationships with both men and women throughout his life. He particularly enjoyed the simultaneous secrecy of New York City; he never officially \"came out\" nor explicitly stated his sexual preference, but he was able to enter the \"clandestine\" homosexual communities of New York and find acceptance within them. Despite never having confirmed his sexuality, homosexual sentiments are clear in several of his poems. In others, the gender of the speaker is not identified, which leaves to interpretation the nature of the relationships presented in said works. Some key evidence that could support the idea of Mckay being bisexual could be his relationship with Walter Jekyll. Some say that it may have been a homosexual relationship between a younger man seduced by an older man. According to Josephine Herbst, she claims that he was bisexual. During his life, McKay was attracted to several men, including Max Eastman from The Liberator, Frank Harris, who was an editor for Pearson's Magazine, and Bishop Henry Sheil who worked for the Catholic Church. Walter Jekyll's influence on Mckay resulted in a combination of social implications. In the 1910s and 1920s he maintained an on-off relationship with the English labor advocate, poet, and translator Charles Ashleigh. ==Works== In 1928, McKay published his most famous novel, Home to Harlem, which won the Harmon Gold Award for Literature. The novel, which depicted street life in Harlem, would have a major impact on black intellectuals in the Caribbean, West Africa, and Europe. Home to Harlem gained a substantial readership, especially among people who wanted to know more about the intense, and sometimes shocking, details of Harlem nightlife. His novel was an attempt to capture the energetic and intense spirit of the \"uprooted black vagabonds.\" In Home to Harlem McKay looked among the common people for a distinctive black identity. Despite this, the book drew fire from one of McKay's contemporaries, W. E. B. Du Bois. To Du Bois, the novel's frank depictions of sexuality and the nightlife in Harlem only appealed to the \"prurient demand[s]\" of white readers and publishers looking for portrayals of black \"licentiousness.\" As Du Bois said, \"Home to Harlem ... for the most part nauseates me, and after the dirtier parts of its filth I feel distinctly like taking a bath.\" Modern critics now dismiss this criticism from Du Bois, who was more concerned with using art as propaganda in the struggle for African-American political liberation than in the value of art to showcase the truth about the lives of black people. McKay's other novels were Banjo (1929) and Banana Bottom (1933). Banjo was noted in part for its portrayal of how the French treated people from its sub-Saharan African colonies, as the novel centers on black seamen in Marseilles. Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire stated that in Banjo, blacks were described truthfully and without \"inhibition or prejudice\". Banana Bottom, McKay's third novel, is said to follow a principal theme of a black individual in search of establishing a cultural identity in a white society. The book discusses underlying racial and cultural tensions. McKay also authored a collection of short stories, Gingertown (1932), two autobiographical books, A Long Way from Home (1937) and My Green Hills of Jamaica (published posthumously in 1979), and a non-fiction, socio-historical treatise entitled Harlem: Negro Metropolis (1940). His collection Selected Poems (1953) was published posthumously and included an introduction by John Dewey. McKay became an American citizen in 1940. In 1943, one year before his conversion into Catholicism, McKay started \"Cycle Manuscript\", a collection of 44 poems, mostly sonnets. In addition, he wrote a letter to Max Eastman, editor of the socialist journal The Liberator, Harlem Renaissance leader, and McKay's close friend, asking Eastman \"to look through\" all the poems and to make any needed \"revisions\". Despite Eastman's revisions, McKay's collection would never be published. The \"Cycle Manuscript\" remains to be a typescript at the Beinecke Library at Yale University, as the \"Cycle Manuscript\" is an important document that illustrates the reflections of an emotional poet who was seeking self-actualization at his point of his life. Becoming disillusioned with communism, McKay embraced the social teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, to which he converted in 1944.James, Winston (2001). A Fierce Hatred of Injustice: Claude McKay's Jamaica and His Poetry of Rebellion (London: Verso), p. 46. He died from a heart attack in Chicago at the age of 58 and is buried at Calvary Cemetery (Queens, New York).Wilson, Scott. Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons, 3rd edn: 2 (Kindle Location 29279). McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition. == Religion == Toward the end of his life, McKay embraced Catholicism, retreating from Communism entirely. His sudden conversion to Catholicism puzzled many for over half a century. When he converted to Catholicism in his final years, he was perceived to be suffering from poverty, health problems, and political and social exclusion by his own beloved Harlem. Before his actual conversion, he wrote to long-time friend and mentor, Max Eastman, about \"doing a lot of reading and research, especially on Catholic work among Negroes----Because if and when I take the step I want to be intellectually honest and sincere about it\". (McKay to Eastman, June 1, 1944). Five months later, when McKay was baptized into the Holy Roman Catholic Church, he wrote to Eastman to assure him that \"I am not less the fighter\" for doing so (McKay to Eastman, October 16, 1944, Rpt. in Passion 305). ==Legacy== In 1977, the government of Jamaica named Claude McKay the national poet and posthumously awarded him the Order of Jamaica for his contribution to literature. In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Claude McKay on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans.Asante, Molefi Kete (2002). 100 Greatest African Americans: A Biographical Encyclopedia. Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books. . McKay is regarded as the \"foremost left-wing black intellectual of his age\" and his work heavily influenced a generation of black authors including James Baldwin and Richard Wright.\"Mckay, Claude (1890-1948)\", from St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture. 2005\u20132006 Thomson Gale.
