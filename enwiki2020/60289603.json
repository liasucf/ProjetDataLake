Golson leads a septet of trombonist Curtis Fuller plus mostly studio musicians from the Los Angeles area, performing a set of generally well-known tunes written by the leader ... trumpeter Oscar Brashear is a pleasant surprise with his lyrical, forward- looking solos. Golson is a pleasure to hear, too, on both tenor and soprano saxophones. Largely, the recording is fairly ordinary, though, with a sense that much of this has been done before, only better, by groups led by Golson. There is better Golson available elsewhere\". == Track listing == All compositions by Benny Golson # \"California Message\" \u2013 5:41 # \"Soul Talk\" \u2013 6:41 # \"Blues March\" \u2013 5:56 # \"The Berliner\" \u2013 5:48 # \"Whisper Not\" \u2013 8:55 # \"Free Again\" \u2013 7:15 # \"I Remember Clifford\" \u2013 6:30 == Personnel == *Benny Golson \u2013 tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone *Curtis Fuller \u2013 trombone *Oscar Brashear \u2013 trumpet *Thurman Green \u2013 trombone *Bill Mays \u2013 piano *Bob Magnusson - bass *Roy McCurdy \u2013 drums ===Production=== *Fumimaru Kawashima, Makoto Kimata \u2013 producer *Ron Nadel \u2013 engineer == References == Category:Benny Golson albums Category:1981 albums Category:Baystate Records albums Category:Timeless Records albums ",
