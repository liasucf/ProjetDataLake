    "text": "Molar refractivity, A, is a measure of the total polarizability of a mole of a substance and is dependent on the temperature, the index of refraction, and the pressure. The molar refractivity is defined as : A = \\frac{4 \\pi}{3} N_A \\alpha, where N_A \\approx 6.022 \\times 10^{23} is the Avogadro constant and \\alpha is the mean polarizability of a molecule. Substituting the molar refractivity into the Lorentz-Lorenz formula gives, for gasses : A = \\frac{R T}{p} \\frac{n^2 - 1}{n^2 + 2} where n is the refractive index, p is the pressure of the gas, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the (absolute) temperature. For a gas, n^2 \\approx 1, so the molar refractivity can be approximated by :A = \\frac{R T}{p} \\frac{n^2 - 1}{3}. In SI units, R has units of J mol\u22121 K\u22121, T has units K, n has no units, and p has units of Pa, so the units of A are m3 mol\u22121. In terms of density \u03c1, molecular weight M, it can be shown that: :A = \\frac{M}{\\rho} \\frac{n^2 - 1}{n^2 + 2} \\approx \\frac{M}{\\rho} \\frac{n^2 - 1}{3}. ==References== * Born, Max, and Wolf, Emil, Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light (7th ed.), section 2.3.3, Cambridge University Press (1999) Category:Physical chemistry Category:Physical optics ",
