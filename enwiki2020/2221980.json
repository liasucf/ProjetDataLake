Though legends vary, all agree that a Scota was the ancestor of the Gaels, who traced their ancestry to Irish invaders, called Scotti, who settled in Argyll and Caledonia, regions which later came to be known as Scotland after their founder. ==Early sources== Edward J. Cowan traced the first mention of Scota in literature to the 12th century.Myth and Identity in Early Medieval Scotland, EJ Cowan, Scottish Historical Review lxiii, No. 176 (Oct. 1984) pp.111\u201335. Scota appears in the Irish chronicle Book of Leinster (containing a redaction of the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn). However, a text found in the 11th-century Historia Brittonum contains an earlier reference to Scota.The Irish identity of the kingdom of the Scots in the 12th and 13th centuries, Dauvit Broun, Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 1999, p. 78. 12th-century sources state that Scota was the daughter of an Egyptian pharaoh, a contemporary of Moses, who married Geytholos (Go\u00eddel Glas), the founder of the Scots and Gaels after being exiled from Egypt.W. Matthews, \"The Egyptians in Scotland: the Political History of a Myth\", Viator 1 (1970), pp.289\u2013306. The earliest Scottish sources claim Geytholos was a king of Greece, Neolus or Heolaus, while the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn describes him as a Scythian. Other manuscripts of the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn contain a variant legend where M\u00edl Esp\u00e1ine appears as Scota's husband, and connects him to ancient Iberia.A dictionary of Celtic mythology, James MacKillop, Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 330. A variant myth in the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn states that there was another Scota. She was the daughter of an Egyptian pharaoh named Cingris, a name found only in Irish legend. She married Niul, son of F\u00e9nius Farsaid. Niul was a Babylonian who traveled to Scythia after the collapse of the Tower of Babel. He was a scholar of languages and was invited by the Pharaoh to Egypt to take Scota's hand in marriage. Scota and Nuil had a son, Go\u00eddel Glas, the eponymous ancestor of the Gaels, who created the Gaelic language by combining the best features of the 72 languages then in existence. ==Scota and the Stone of Scone== Baldred Bisset is credited with being the first to connect the Stone of Scone with the Scota foundation legends in his 1301 work Processus, putting forward an argument that Scotland, not Ireland, was where the original Scota homeland lay.The Irish identity of the kingdom of the Scots in the 12th and 13th centuries, Dauvit Broun, Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 1999, p. 120. Bisset wanted to legitimize a Scottish (as opposed to English) accession to the throne when Alexander III of Scotland died in 1286. At his coronation in 1249, Alexander himself heard his royal genealogy recited generations back to Scota. Bisset attempted to legitimize a Scottish accession by highlighting Scota's importance as the transporter of the Stone of Scone from Egypt during the exodus of Moses to Scotland. In 1296, the Stone was captured by Edward I of England and taken to Westminster Abbey. In 1323, Robert the Bruce used Bisset's legend connecting Scota to the Stone in an attempt to return it to Scone Abbey in Scotland.Reading the medieval in early modern England, Gordon McMullan, David Matthews, Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 109. The 15th- century English chronicler John Hardyng later attempted to debunk Bisset's claims.Glastonbury Abbey and the Arthurian tradition, James P. Carley, Boydell & Brewer, 2001, p. 275 ff. ==Later sources== Andrew of Wyntoun's Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland and John of Fordun's Chronica Gentis Scotorum (1385) are sources of the Scota legends, alongside Thomas Grey's Scalacronica (1362). Hector Boece's 16th-century Historia Gentis Scotorum (\"History of the Scottish People\") also mentions the Scota foundation myth. Walter Bower's 15th-century Scotichronicon included the first illustrations of the legends. ==Grave of Scota== Signpost on by-road, south of Tralee The grave of Scota (or Scotia's Grave) allegedly lies in a valley south of Tralee Town, Co. Kerry, Ireland. The area is known as Glenn Scoithin, \"Vale of the Little Flower\", but is more popularly referred to as Foley's Glen (Foley's Glen). A trail from the road leads along a stream to a clearing where a circle of large stones marks the grave site, as indicated by a County Council signpost. ==Sources== *Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn *Geoffrey Keating, Forus Feasa ar \u00c9irinn * Seumas MacManus, The Story of the Irish Race (February 1970 The Devin-Adair Company New York) * Seumas MacManus, The Story of the Irish Race (1990 edition printed by Wings Books) * Michael O'Clery, Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland (1616\u20131636 Donegal) * Benedict Fitzpatrick's (1901\u20131963) \"Ireland and the Foundations of Europe\" ==See also== * Scotia's Grave * Scotia ==References== Category:Legendary Irish people Category:Scottish mythology Category:British traditional history Category:Legendary Scottish people ",
