    "text": "McJoe Arroyo Acevedo (born December 5, 1985) is a Puerto Rican professional boxer who held the IBF junior bantamweight title from 2015 to 2016. As an amateur, he represented Puerto Rico in international competition, winning a bronze medal at the 2007 World Amateur Boxing Championships in the bantamweight category. His twin brother, McWilliams Arroyo, is also a professional boxer. The brothers are the only pair of twins to win medals at the World Amateur Boxing Championships, and the second twins to qualify for the Olympics in boxing. ==Early life== McJoe was born along his twin brother, McWilliams, in the municipality of Ceiba in the northeast coastal region of Puerto Rico's main island. Arroyo and his twin, were introduced to boxing in their childhood. At the age of 12, they entered Gimnasio Fito Ramos, a gymnasium located in the municipality of Fajardo, Puerto Rico. In this locale they met Anthony Otero, a retired amateur boxer, who became their trainer during this stage of their careers. They initially took up the sport as a hobby, but after six fights they began establishing a pattern of only spending a limited amount of time inactive during a month, visiting the gymnasium at least every two weeks. Since the early stages of their careers, the brothers decided to fight in different divisions, in order to avoid fighting against each other. However, they participated in sparring sessions, performing as they would do against other sparring partners. ==Amateur career== Arroyo represented Puerto Rico in international competition. He won Bronze at flyweight at 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games. In 2007 he participated at the Amateur World Championships and lost in the semifinals to eventual Russian winner Sergey Vodopyanov 9:20, qualifying for the 2008 Olympic Games. After recovering, Arroyo participated in the XXVIII International Golden Belt Tournament organized in Constanta, Romania. Here he defeated local Alex Spatariu in his first fight, who abandoned the fight in the third round. In the semifinals he defeated Mirzhan Rakhimzanov of Kazajistan by points, with scores of 21-16. In the finals he fought against Veira de Jes\u00fas of Brazil, defeating him by points (28-16). As part of their training the boxing team moved to South Korea, in order to assimilate the time changes. After training and participating in a series of exhibition matches, the team traveled from Korea to Beijing. ==Professional career== On December 8, 2009, the Arroyo brothers issued a press release through their mother, Milagros Acevedo, informing that they were no longer interested in continuing their amateur careers. In the letter, they report differences with the criteria used to provide economical support to high-performance athletes, as well as schedule conflicts with their original plans to pursue a professional career after the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games. These concerns were restated in a subsequent press conference, where they noted that supporting their respective families was the main reason to pursue a professional career. On January 12, 2010, PR Best Boxing announced the official signing of both brothers. Arroyo's debut was scheduled for February 27, 2010, where he competed in the bantamweight division as part of a card titled \"Haciendo Historia\", where Wilfredo V\u00e1zquez, Jr. fought Marvin Sonsona for the super bantamweight world championship. His opponent, Giovanni Rivera, had a previous experience of two professional fights. The fight began with Rivera moving around the ring, while Arroyo pursued him while engaging on the offensive, eventually scoring a knockdown. After 25 seconds of the second round had passed, he scored a second knockdown, prompting the referee to stop the contest by technical knockout. In his second fight, Arroyo defeated Steve Cannell by unanimous decision, winning all four rounds. Next he won a consecutive decision over Jairo Delgado. In his first six-round fight, Arroyo defeated Jason Rorie by technical knockout. On August 28, 2010, he scored a unanimous decision win over Sigfredo Medina. Arroyo then entered the first knockout streak of his career, which began with a first round victory over Israel Rojas. This run was completed by third and first-round technical knockouts over Eduardo Mel\u00e9ndez and Ivan Moxey. However, Arroyo was forced to rest eight months between these two fights after suffering a chin fracture, making his return in the super flyweight division. He then faced Shawn Nichol in consecutive fights, winning both by unanimous decision in six rounds. On September 27, 2012, Arroyo defeated former world champion Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez by technical knockout in four rounds. He repeated this performance against Felipe Rivas, winning the World Boxing Organization's Latino championship. Arroyo returned with a unanimous decision wins over Jairo Hern\u00e1ndez in eight rounds. He won the next fight in equal fashion, this time against former contender David Quijano. On June 14, 2014, Arroyo scored an eleventh-round technical knockout over former world champion Hern\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez in an International Boxing Federation title eliminator. He gathered knockdowns in the first, fourth, eighth and final rounds. == Professional boxing record == {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\" |- ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes |- |21 |Loss |18\u20133 |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Luis Nery | |4 (10), |16 Mar 2019 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |20 |Win |18\u20132 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Sander Diaz | |8 |2 Jun 2018 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |19 |Loss |17\u20132 |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Rau'shee Warren |UD |12 |29 Jul 2017 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |18 |Loss |17\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Jerwin Ancajas |UD |12 |3 Sep 2016 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |17 |Win |17\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Arthur Villanueva | |10 (12), |18 Jul 2015 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |16 |Win |16\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Mark Anthony Geraldo |UD |12 |20 Dec 2014 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |15 |Win |15\u20130 |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Hern\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez |TKO |11 (12), |14 Jun 2014 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |- |14 |Win |14\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|David Quijano |UD |8 |28 Apr 2014 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |13 |Win |13\u20130 |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Jairo Ochoa |UD |8 |20 Apr 2013 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |12 |Win |12\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Felipe Rivas |TKO |4 (10), |2 Feb 2013 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |11 |Win |11\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez |TKO |4 (10), |27 Sep 2012 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |- |10 |Win |10\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Shawn Nichol |UD |6 |10 Mar 2012 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |9 |Win |9\u20130 |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Shawn Nichol |UD |6 |7 Oct 2011 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |8 |Win |8\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Ivan Moxey |TKO |1 (6), |2 Sep 2011 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |7 |Win |7\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Eduardo Melendez |TKO |3 (6), |22 Jan 2011 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |6 |Win |6\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Israel Rojas |TKO |1 (6), |16 Oct 2010 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |5 |Win |5\u20130 |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Sigfredo Medina |UD |6 |28 Aug 2010 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |4 |Win |4\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Jason Rorie |TKO |6 (6), |10 Jul 2010 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |3 |Win |3\u20130 |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Jairo Delgado |UD |4 |29 May 2010 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |2 |Win |2\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Steve Cannell | |4 |17 Apr 2010 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |1 |Win |1\u20130 |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Giovanny Rivera | |2 (4), |27 Feb 2010 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |} ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Bantamweight boxers Category:Boxers at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic boxers of Puerto Rico Category:People from Ceiba, Puerto Rico Category:Twin sportspeople Category:Twin people from Puerto Rico Category:Puerto Rican male boxers Category:AIBA World Boxing Championships medalists Category:Central American and Caribbean Games bronze medalists for Puerto Rico Category:Competitors at the 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games Category:Central American and Caribbean Games medalists in boxing ",
