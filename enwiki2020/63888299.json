    "text": "M\u00f2ji\u0101ng virus (MojV), officially Mojiang henipavirus, is a virus in the family Paramyxoviridae. Based on phylogenetic studies, M\u00f2ji\u0101ng virus is placed in the genus Henipavirus or described as a henipa-like virus. Antibodies raised against M\u00f2ji\u0101ng virus glycoproteins are serologically distinct from other Henipaviruses (among which higher cross-reactivity is observed). It was first identified in 2012 when a cluster of patients were diagnosed with severe pneumonia connected to an abandoned mine in Mojiang Hani Autonomous County, Yunnan Province in China. Samples from mammal species present in the cave including Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rattus flavipectus, and Crocidura dracula were tested for viruses and sequenced. There were 38 sequence reads obtained closely related to members of the Henipavirus genus. Infectious virus particles could only be recovered from 4 samples of R. flavipectus and were cultured in Vero E6, BHK-21, and HEp-2 cells. While no person-to-person transmission was documented, the full range of mammalian hosts susceptible M\u00f2ji\u0101ng virus is unknown. The cell surface receptor for M\u00f2ji\u0101ng virus remains unknown. Unlike all other known Henipavirus members, M\u00f2ji\u0101ng virus does not bind Ephrin B2/B3. The M\u00f2ji\u0101ng virus attachment glycoprotein (MojV-G) lacks an Ephrin B2 binding site and does not bind other common paramyxovirus receptors, including sialic acid or CD150, in cell culture. == References == Category:Paramyxoviridae ",
