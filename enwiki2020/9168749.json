He made several vain attempts to win the lost prestige. When Kakatiyas were fighting Yadavas, he seized the opportunity and reoccupied Verlanadu including places like Chandolu and Vengi. However he lost to Kakatiyas and Nellore Chodas starting from 1201 to 1207 AD. == References == * Durga Prasad, History of the Andhras up to 1565 A. D., P. G.
