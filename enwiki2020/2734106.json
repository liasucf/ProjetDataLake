    "text": "Cecil Lee Upshaw Jr. (October 22, 1942 \u2013 February 7, 1995) was an American professional baseball right-handed relief pitcher, who had a nine- year career in Major League Baseball (MLB) (1966\u20131969, 1971\u20131975), for the Atlanta Braves and Houston Astros of the National League (NL), and the Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees, and Chicago White Sox of the American League (AL). Born in Spearsville, Louisiana, Upshaw attended Bossier High School (Louisiana) and played college baseball at Centenary College of Louisiana, in Shreveport. He is a member of the Centenary Athletics Hall of Fame. While at Centenary, Upshaw was a member of the Kappa Sigma fraternity. Upshaw was among the top ten in saves four times in the National League between 1968 and 1972. He was primarily a sidearm pitcher. In the Braves\u2019 division-winning campaign, Upshaw had a 6\u20134 win\u2013loss record, with a 2.91 earned run average (ERA), and a career- high 27 saves (to finish second in the league). Upshaw\u2018s career was cut short due to an unfortunate incident in 1970. He and two other Braves players were walking down a San Diego sidewalk and one of the other players bet him he could not jump up and touch an overhead awning. Upshaw did reach the awning, but a ring on his pitching hand ring finger got caught on a projection off of the awning and tore ligaments in his hand. He never fully recovered, but he was considered one of the better relief pitchers in major league baseball up to that time. He was traded along with Chris Chambliss and Dick Tidrow from the Indians to the Yankees for Fritz Peterson, Steve Kline, Fred Beene and Tom Buskey on April 26, 1974. The Yankees were criticized for giving away four pitchers as opposed to the two it got in return and a failure to land a starting second baseman.Chass, Murray. \"Yankee\u2010Indian Trade Brings Confusion, Anger and Leaves 2d\u2010Base Question,\" The New York Times, Sunday, April 28, 1974.
