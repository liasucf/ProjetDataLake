Voters went to the polls to elect, on the local level, a new Governor of Chiapas to serve a six-year term. ==Gubernatorial election== Five candidates registered as candidates to fight the election. However, on August 10, Francisco Rojas Toledo of the National Action Party and Emilio Zebad\u00faa of New Alliance announced that they were withdrawing from the election and throwing their support behind the Institutional Revolutionary Party's Jos\u00e9 Antonio Aguilar Bodegas in order to present a united front to prevent Juan Jos\u00e9 Sabines Guerrero, representing the Alliance for the Good of All and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of incumbent governor Pablo Salazar Mendiguch\u00eda, from winning. Rojas and Zebad\u00faa called on their supporters to vote for Aguilar Bodegas instead; however, their names still appeared on the ballot papers and votes were cast for both \u2014 in amounts greater than the difference between the two leading candidates. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=#cccccc !
