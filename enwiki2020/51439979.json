The shrub typically grows to a height of and has non-glaucous branchlets. It has simple, flat, terete and undissected leaves with a blade that is long and wide. It blooms from July to September and produces an axillary raceme irregular inflorescence with red or pink flowers and orange or pink styles. Later it forms wrinkled ellipsoidal glabrous fruit that is long. It is similar to Grevillea decipiens which has 7\u20139 longitudinal ridges on the upper leaf surface and a densely brown-silky outer perianth surface which is white of G. sparsifolia. Grevillea pauciflora is also similar, but has a different style. Grevillea sparsiflora is found between Mount Ragged, to the east of Esperance and has a range that extends as far east as Twilight Cove. It grows on sand dunes, limestone cliffs and in Eucalypt woodlands in sandy and loamy soils. ==See also== * List of Grevillea species ==References== sparsiflora Category:Endemic flora of Western Australia Category:Eudicots of Western Australia Category:Proteales of Australia Category:Taxa named by Ferdinand von Mueller ",
