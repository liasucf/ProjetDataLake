In high school he took up the tenor saxophone and began studying jazz. He later attended the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. Speed has lived in New York City since 1992. ==Career== He leads or co-leads the groups Pachora (with Jim Black, Sk\u00fali Sverrisson, and Brad Shepik); Human Feel (with Andrew D'Angelo, Black, and Kurt Rosenwinkel); The Clarinets (with Oscar Noriega and Anthony Burr), yeah NO (with Black, Sverrisson, and Cuong Vu); Trio Iffy (with Ben Perowsky and Jamie Saft), Endangered Blood (with Black, Noriega and Trevor Dunn) and the Chris Speed Trio (with Dave King and Chris Tordini). The latter groups predominantly feature Speed's compositions. Speed has performed with the avant-garde jazz groups Bloodcount (Tim Berne, Jim Black, Michael Formanek, and sometimes Marc Ducret); The Claudia Quintet (John Hollenbeck, Matt Moran, Ted Reichman, and Drew Gress); Alasnoaxis (Jim Black, Sverrisson, and Hilmar Jensson); and Heroic Frenzies (Craig Taborn, Dave King, and Chris Lightcap). In partnership with other NY musicians like Jim Black, bassist Skuli Sverrisson, and guitarist Brad Shepik he participated in the band Pachora. Formed in 1992, Pachora played music from Greece, Bulgaria and Macedonia. Evolving from this Speed began using the melodies of Balkan music interpreting it into jazz-based music. Being a part of the Pachora he made a lot of performances throughout North America and Europe and playing in their original manner - Pachora 1997, Unn 1999, Ast 2000 and Astereotypical 2003. Speed also took part in the traditional Slavic Soul Party in the period of 1996-2004 showing his involvement with East European music. He was experimenting with clarinet improvisation in trio \"The Clarinets\" with Oscar Noriega and Anthony Burr. They created \"an acoustic ambient music of unusual grace and beauty\" issuing two albums \"The Clarinets\" 2006 and \"Keep On Going Like This\" 2012. In 1996 Speed based the band \"Yeah NO\" and released an unusual mixture of \"free jazz, modern rock, eastern folk and minimalism\". In April 2006 he issued Skirl Records - a brand dedicated to creative music of Brooklyn which now has 31 releases.Speed Retrieved on 27 Jan 2018 ==Gallery== Chris Speed in Aarhus, Denmark.
