    "text": "The 2018 Sun Belt conference football season began on August 30, 2018, and ended on November 24, 2018. It was a part of the 2018 season of the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), the top level of NCAA Division I football. The Sun Belt Conference Football Championship Game was played on December 1, 2018, with Appalachian State winning the inaugural game. The entire schedule was released on February 27. ==Preseason== ===Coaches predictions=== The 2018 preseason coaches football poll was released on July 19, voted from the 10 coaches of the conference. Appalachian State and Arkansas State were chosen to be the finalist for their division, with the Red Wolves predicted to win the first ever Sun Belt Championship Game. East Division *1. Appalachian State (6 first-place votes) *2. Troy (4) *3. Georgia State *4. Georgia Southern *5. Coastal Carolina West Division *1. Arkansas State (9) *2. Louisiana\u2013Monroe *3. South Alabama (1) *4. Louisiana *5. Texas State ==Season== This will be the first season with 10 teams as the New Mexico State left the conference to become independent and Idaho downgraded to FCS and compete in the Big Sky Conference. The scheduling format for the ten members were reset for the 2018 season. Each member will play eight other members in the conference with four at home and four away. The conference was split up with five teams representing the east and the other five representing the west division. A team will play each team within their division (4 teams) and four from the other division (two at home and two away). South Alabama (west division) and Troy (east) will be the only two teams to play each other every year due to their rivalry and proximity to each other. ==Schedule== ===Regular season=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Index to colors and formatting |- style=\"background:#cfc;\" |Sun Belt member won |- style=\"background:#fcc;\" |Sun Belt member lost |- |Sun Belt teams in bold |} ====Week One==== Players of the WeekWeek 1 Sun Belt Conference Football Players of the Week Announced. sunbeltsports.org (2018-09-03).
