All parts of the plant, with the highest concentration being in the roots and seeds, contain aconitine, which is a potent nerve poison. ==Conservation== In Poland, Aconitum firmum is a protected species, along with all other monkshood species in Poland. The subspecies A. firmum subsp. moravicum is recognized as Near Threatened by the IUCN Red List, although A. firmum itself has not been evaluated by the IUCN. ==Taxonomy== ===Name=== Aconitum firmum was named by Ludwig Reichenbach.
