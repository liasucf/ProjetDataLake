    "text": "Robert Michael \"Bobby\" Thompson (18 November 1911 \u2013 16 April 1988) was a stand-up comedian, actor and entertainer from Penshaw, Sunderland. Although he was raised in Penshaw, he also lived in Great Lumley and Barley Mow, near Chester-le-Street, later moving to Whitley Bay. ==Early years== He was the seventh child of John and Mary Thompson, both of whom died by the time Bobby was eight years old. He was then raised by his elder sister in the village of Fatfield. After leaving school at fifteen, he started worked at North Biddick Colliery, earning seven shillings and sixpence a week. He would supplement his income by playing the harmonica around local working men's clubs and competing in domino tournaments. His first stand-up performance took place at the Gem Cinema in Penshaw as a young boy. Thompson was married three times. His second wife, Phyllis, died on 25 April 1967. He announced his engagement to Mary Douglass, 62, of Annfield Plain a few years later, but the engagement was called off. In 1980, Thompson married his housekeeper, Eleanor Cicely Palmer, more commonly known as Cissy Ward (n\u00e9e Wake). Thompson was her third husband and she was famous for being taller than him. ==Career== Famous for his broad Pitmatic (County Durham pit village) accent (often mistaken for Geordie), self-deprecating humour and mastery of the mother-in-law joke, Thompson was affectionately known as The Little Waster due to his short stature, which he often played on during his act, describing himself as 'Little Bobby'. His most famous outfit was a worn out stripey jumper (Wooly gansey) and flat cap. His ever-present Woodbine cigarette stub, hanging from the corner of his mouth, was also an integral part of his on-stage persona. His attempts to move beyond North East England were limited by his accent and the regional bias of his humour, although he did enjoy some success with the BBC show, Wot Cheor Geordie. He was also renowned for his problems with the tax man, stemming from the fact that he never seemed to pay any. This was an unfortunate fact that he turned to humour in his stage act. Bobby made recordings of three comedy songs written for him by local composer Eric Boswell: You Little Waster, The Golden Voice of Bobby and When I Was A Lad. The songs incorporated jokes from Bobby's act and When I Was A Lad was even released as a single locally. Problems with drink, finances and his health affected his career in the 1970s, but he remained a North East favourite, particularly on the club scene, until shortly before his death. ==Quotes== *\"The dole is my shepherd, I shall not work.\" *\"She shouts from upstairs, Bobby can yer fix the string on wa carrier bag . . . why am nae engineer.\" *\"I'll give ya a bottle o' Brandy if you can tell us you pay the 'lectric bill before you get the red letter.\" *\"A man come to oor door.
