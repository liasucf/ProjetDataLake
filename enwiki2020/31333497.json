Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 2006. ==Poetry== The rare books collection at Harvard University's Yenching Library possesses the only known copy of an eight fascicle work by Jakdan titled Jabduha ucuri amtanggai baita (. The first seven fascicles contain 345 poems or songs translated from Chinese into Manchu, some of which appear to be Zidishu. Bosson and Toh were the first to note that the eighth fascicle of Jabduha ucuri amtanggai baita did not contain translations, but rather original poetry.Bosson, James, and Toh Hoong Teik. \"Jakdan and His Manchu Poetry.\" Proceedings of the First North American Conference on Manchu Studies, vol. 1, pp. 13-25, Tunguso-Sibirica no. 15.
