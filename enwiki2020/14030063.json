Former Steeler's charity work with NFL group does Pittsburgh proud, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette After starting his final (36) with Arizona State University which included three Bowl Game appearances (Holiday, Rose and Freedom), Kalis was the 17th offensive lineman (the fifth guard) in the fourth-round (108th pick) of the Minnesota Vikings in the 1988 NFL Draft. ==Early life== Kalis was born in Stillwater, Minnesota. He spent his early childhood there before moving with his father, mother and two sisters to Hudson, Wisconsin. Shortly thereafter he moved again to Phoenix where he attended Thunderbird High School and lettered in football, tennis and track and field. ==Playing career== Kalis was heavily recruited out of high school for football and tennis. He accepted an offer from head coach Darryl Rogers to play at Arizona State University. Kalis preferred to stay in his hometown which allowed his parents the opportunity to attend his home games on Saturday nights in Tempe, Arizona. Kalis redshirted his freshman season in 1983 with the Sun Devils playing defensive end. In 1984 Kalis met with head coach Darryl Rogers prior to the start of spring practice. Kalis was told by Rogers he would be moved to the offensive line following the conclusion of spring practice if he did not secure either a first or second string position. Kalis contemplated the conversation and returned the next day to tell head coach Darryl Rogers to move him to the offense immediately. Kalis believed Rogers had already made up his mind to move him to the offensive line so Kalis decided not to wait to get a head start on the new position. Kalis participated in the 1984 spring practice sessions as an offensive tackle. In 1985 Arizona State University hired head coach John Cooper. Prior to the spring practice sessions Kalis was asked by offensive line coach Tom Freeman to move to the right guard position. Kalis competed and won the first string right guard position and started every game for the Sun Devils in 1985. The Sun Devils completed the season with an 8\u20133 record and an invitation to play in the 1985 Holiday Bowl against the Arkansas Razorbacks at Jack Murphy Stadium. On December 22, 1985 Arizona State lost to the Arkansas Razorbacks 18-17. The 1986 Arizona State University football season proved to be a very historic year for the Sun Devils. Arizona State finished the regular season with a record of 9\u20131\u20131 and won the Pac-10 Conference title and received an invitation to play the Michigan Wolverines in the 1987 Rose Bowl.

The Vikings finished the regular season 11\u20135 and reached the NFL playoffs as a NFC Wild Card team and beat the Los Angeles Rams 28-17 on December 26, 1988.

The San Francisco 49ers went on to win Super Bowl XXIII. The Minnesota Vikings finished the season 2nd in the NFC Central Division. In 1989 Kalis was given the opportunity to compete for the starting right guard position on the offensive line. He was successful and started every 1989 regular season game as well as the 1990 playoff game versus the San Francisco 49ers. Kalis joined fellow starting offensive lineman Tim Irwin (right tackle), Kirk Lowdermilk (center), Randall McDaniel (left guard/Hall of Fame 2009) and Gary Zimmerman (left tackle/Hall of Fame 2008).

On January 2, 1993 the Vikings played the Washington Redskins at the Metrodome in Minnesota and even though the Vikings had the home field advantage, they lost the game 24\u20137. The Minnesota Vikings finished the season with a record of 11\u20135 and 1st in the NFC Central Division. The 1993 season was a year of recovery for Kalis. Following an extensive rehabilitation regimen due to the knee injury from the previous year, Kalis battled and recaptured the starting right guard position. As the season progressed so did his play and the Vikings returned to the NFC playoffs for the fourth time during his six-year tenure as a Viking. The team finished 9\u20137 and secured a Wild Card Playoff berth. On January 9, 1994 the Vikings played against the New York Giants at Giants Stadium with Jim McMahon as their starting quarterback. The Vikings lost the game 17\u201310 and Kalis played his last game as a Minnesota Viking. The Minnesota Vikings finished the season 2nd in the NFC Central Division. ===Pittsburgh Steelers 1994=== During the off season prior to the 1994 regular season Kalis worked with his agent G. Bruce Allen to find a new NFL home. On May 20, 1994 he signed a new three-year contract and began his career with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He competed and won the right guard position and joined fellow starting offensive lineman Leon Searcy (right tackle), Dermontti Dawson (center/Hall of Fame 2012), Duval Love (left guard), John Jackson (left tackle). On November 20, 1994 the Steelers faced the Miami Dolphins in week (12) of the regular season. The Steelers lost the game in overtime 16-13 and also lost Kalis for the rest of the season due to a broken ankle suffered in overtime while completing a downfield block for running back Barry Foster. The Steelers finished the season 12-4-0, won the AFC Central Division title and defeated the Cleveland Browns 29-9 on January 7, 1995 in the AFC Division Playoff game at Three Rivers Stadium. On January 15, 1995 the Steelers faced the San Diego Chargers in the AFC Conference Championship Game. Late in the fourth quarter the Steelers marched from their own 17-yard line to the San Diego 3 to put themselves in position for a potential winning touchdown. However, on fourth down, Chargers linebacker Dennis Gibson sealed the victory by tipping away Neil O'Donnell's pass intended for running back Barry Foster. The San Diego Chargers won the game 17-13 and went on to lose 49-26 to the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIX. The Pittsburgh Steelers finished 1st in the AFC Central Division. ===Cincinnati Bengals 1995=== Kalis began the 1995 season by attending training camp in Latrobe, Pennsylvania with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was returning from a season ending ankle surgery and was surprised to find himself being asked to play the left guard position during the pre-season. He started all (4) pre-season games at left guard due to an illness that Tom Newberry had battled throughout training camp. On the last day of training camp Kalis was released by the Steelers. Two days later he was in Cincinnati signing a new contract with the Bengals. Kalis saw limited action early in the season at both left and right guard. Kalis replaced Bruce Kozerski as the starting right guard when Kozerski suffered a season/career ending ankle injury. Kalis was the starting right guard for the Cincinnati Bengals for the last game ever played at Cleveland Municipal Stadium on December 17, 1995. At the time it was believed to be the last Cleveland Browns game ever to be played in Cleveland. Kalis was on the field when a time out was called by the officials to allow the Bengals to relocate to the other end of the field. The officials wanted to create more distance between the Bengals players and the fans who had already begun to tear seats out of the stadium and throw them onto the field. Kalis started his final NFL football game on December 24, 1995 beating the Minnesota Vikings 27-24 at Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Cincinnati Bengals finished the season with a record of 7-9 and 2nd in the AFC Central Division. ===NFL Alumni=== Kalis began his work with the NFL Alumni, a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization after being voted President of the Pittsburgh Chapter in June 2000.
