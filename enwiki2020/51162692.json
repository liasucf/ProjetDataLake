    "text": "\"Too Young\" is a song by American rapper Post Malone. Originally released on April 23, 2015 on SoundCloud. It was released on October 9, 2015, by Republic Records as the second single from his debut studio album, Stoney. The track was written by Austin Post, Michael Hernandez, Carlos Suarez, Justin Mosley, Trocon Roberts Jr. and Steven Bolden. This song was dedicated to ASAP Yams, Christian Taylor and Chinx. ==Background== Post Malone said in an interview with Genius that \"After A$AP Yams passed I recorded this song, so it's kind of an ode to him. We weren't friends but I think it was so cool how he was a cultural icon and he inspired so many people to do what they wanted to do. And he had such an influence on the youth of today. I think it was a tragedy that he went so soon. I just thought it was the right thing, to pay tribute to him. Then, in Dallas, this kid Christian Taylor passed. And he was on to this song before he was killed, and that is surreal. I was living with a kid in Dallas and I don\u2019t know what happened but apparently the cops shot him and a couple days before he was killed he did the lyrics to my song. That is a crazy scenario. Fans have said it means a lot to them and I think that\u2019s cool how a song reminds us that we can reach others with a different perspective and it can mean something to them as well. Everybody can relate to something in a certain way.\" ==Music video== The song's accompanying music video premiered on October 22, 2015 on Post Malone's Vevo account on YouTube. The music video was directed by John Rawlins. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Bubbling Under R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles (Billboard) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 8 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal (AFP) | 1927 |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !Region !Date !Format !Ref. |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| United States | rowspan=\"1\"| October 9, 2015 | rowspan=\"1\"|Digital download | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- |} ==References== ==External links== * *Lyrics of this song at Genius Category:2015 singles Category:2015 songs Category:Republic Records singles Category:Post Malone songs Category:Songs written by Post Malone Category:Songs written by FKi 1st Category:Songs written by Michael Hernandez (songwriter) ",
