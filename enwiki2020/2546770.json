    "text": "The Church of St Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire, is a parish church in the Church of England. The church is Grade II* listed as it is a particularly significant building of more than local interest. ==Background== It is set in a peaceful churchyard overlooking the market place in the centre of the town. The building itself is of great architectural interest and is built on the site of an old Saxon church. The church tower which stands high above the town was constructed in stages between the 12th and 14th century whilst the porch was built in 1320. The medieval church consisted only of a chancel, nave, north aisle and tower but it was considerably enlarged in the Victorian period. The top stage of the tower is 14th century as is the south porch.Pevsner, N. (1951) Nottinghamshire. Harmondsworth: Penguin; p. 85 The rest of the building is the result of extensive restoration work which began in 1872. The south aisle was added by Evans and Jolly between 1872 and 1874, and the transepts by Robert Charles Clarke in 1887 and 1888. In 1888 the Lady Chapel was re-built, a beautiful example of nineteenth century craftsmanship. The Victorian baptistery which used to contain the 14th century font has now been converted into a Visitor Centre where display boards and wall panels give visitors a chance to find out a little more about the Church. There are also many beautiful carvings and wall mosaics around the church. In 2004, there was a carved stone cross, a Khatchkar, given to the church in memory of the work that the rector had done for Armenia. Hucknall - the only two khatchkar town in Western Europe , St Mary Armenian Church, Toronto, accessed 25 September 2008 The stone which had been at Holgate School was given in thanks for the British people's contributions which enable the rebuilding of Lord Byron School in Gyumri which had been destroyed by an earthquake in 1988. It was thought that the original stone may have been damaged by football fans who confused Armenia with Albania.Byron festival finale, 16 June 2004, Hucknall Dispatch, accessed 25 September 2008 ==Current parish status== It is in a group of parishes which includes: *Church of St John the Evangelist, Hucknall *Church of St Mary Magdalene, Hucknall *Church of St Peter and St Paul, Hucknall ==Gallery== Image:StMaryHucknall.JPG| Image:StMaryHucknall1.JPG| Image:StMaryHucknall2.JPG| Image:StMaryHucknall3.JPG| ==Burials== ===Byron family=== St Mary Magdalene served as the traditional burial place of the Byron family who maintained a family vault there.
