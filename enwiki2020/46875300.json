It is principally a middle-class and industrial neighbourhood located between the barrios of Villa Martelli and Munro, also in the same partido (department). == Location == The city is located between Avenida de los Constituyentes (in the limit with General San Mart\u00edn Partido) and the Autopista Pascual Palazzo (mostly known as \"Panamericana\" or \"Acceso Norte\"). This highway divides the district into two neighborhoods: Florida Este (from Panamaricana to Maip\u00fa Avenue) and Florida Oeste (from Panamericana to Constituyentes Avenue). The other boundaries are Antonio Malavar (at north) and Carlos F. Melo (at south) streets. Florida Oeste is served by the Belgrano Norte Line, which provide easy access to the city of Buenos Aires as well as north of GBA, such as Boulogne Sur Mer, Grand Bourg and Del Viso. Florida Oeste's main commercial areas are centered on General San Mart\u00edn and Mitre Avenues. == History == Colegiales, the most notable club of the neighborhood. Santa Mar\u00eda Magdalena church. Ram\u00f3n Carrillo health centre. In 1907 the C\u00f3rdoba Central Railway extended its tracks to the lands where Florida Oeste exists nowadays. The station was a precarious stop with no name, informally nicknamed La Trocha (The Gauge). In 1913, a local company, Narciso Ag\u00fcero & C\u00eda., was granted a concession to pave San Mart\u00edn Avenue. While works were in progress, a big poster with the name of the company was placed there so people named it as \"Ag\u00fcero\". In 1920 the old roof was replaced with a building with sheds. By request from the neighborhoods, the station was officially named \"Florida\".Historia del Ferrocarril al Norte del Gran Buenos Aires: Ferrocarriles Mitre y Belgrano by Ariel Bernasconi - Dunken Editorial (2012) - Helped by the railway, many families came to the region and settled their stores, selling goods to farmers and railway workers. The increasing development of Florida brought other transportations, such as buses with Fano and Boraso companies among them. The first sport clubs were also founded by then, American Football Club (a predecessor of Florida Football Club) in 1934, Uni\u00f3n Florida in 1929 and the Florida Club (after the merging of Asociaci\u00f3n de Fomento Vecinal and Florida FC).

The first church was Parroquia Santa Mar\u00eda Magdalena, opened in 1963. The Santa Rosa Hospital and Maternity was founded in October 1944, being the 2nd among the most important health centers of Vicente L\u00f3pez. Originally a maternity only, the building was successively remodeled and enlarged to host more services.\"Florida Oeste\" at Vicente L\u00f3pez website In July 2013 was opened the \"Unidad de Respuesta Inmediata\" (URI) Ram\u00f3n Carrillo, a health center for emergencies that also handles dentistry, pediatrics, cardiology, traumatology and mental health among other medical specialities.
