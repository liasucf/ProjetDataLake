    "text": "Al Stillman (n\u00e9 Albert Irving Silverman; 26 June 1901 Manhattan, New York \u2013 17 February 1979 Manhattan, New York) was an American lyricist. ==Biography== Stillman was born to Jewish parents Herman Silverman and Gertrude Rubin (maiden). He adopted the name \"Albert Stillman\" as a professional pseudonym. He chose the name, reportedly, because it was the recognizable surname of a well-known New York banking family. He was Jewish. He attended New York University. After graduation, he contributed to Franklin P. Adams' newspaper column, and in 1933 became a staff writer at Radio City Music Hall, a position he held for almost 40 years. Stillman collaborated with a number of composers: Fred Ahlert, Robert Allen, Percy Faith, George Gershwin, Ernesto Lecuona, Paul McGrane, Kay Swift, and Arthur Schwartz. Many of his collaborations with Allen were major hits in the 1950s for The Four Lads; the Stillman/Allen team also wrote hit songs for Perry Como and Johnny Mathis. Stillman was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1982. ==Songs for which Stillman wrote lyrics== === Music by Robert Allen === ==== Perry Como hits ==== *\"Home for the Holidays\" (1954) (Still played during the Christmas holiday.) *\"My One and Only Heart\" (1953) *\"You Alone (Solo Tu)\" (1953, redone in 1961) ==== Four Lads hits ==== *\"Enchanted Island\" (1958) *\"Moments to Remember\" (1955) *\"No, Not Much\" (1956) *\"There\u2019s Only One of You\" (1958) *\"Who Needs You?\" (1956) ====Johnny Mathis hits==== *\"Chances Are\" (1957) *\"It's Not For Me to Say\" (1957) *\"Teacher, Teacher\" (1958) === Music by Ernesto Lecuona === *\"The Breeze and I\" (1940) *\"In Spain They Say \u2018Si Si\u2019\" (co-written with Francia Luban) *\"You're the One\" as recorded by Kathy Kirby in 1964 ===Others=== *\"Air Cadet Song (music by Louis E.De Francesco, 1944 (published by Sam Fox Pub Co.
