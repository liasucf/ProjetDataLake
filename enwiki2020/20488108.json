    "text": "Jo\u00eblle Ceccaldi-Raynaud (born 9 February 1951) is a French politician. As a member of parliament, she represents one of the districts of the Hauts-de- Seine department (close to Paris). As a politician, she is affiliated to the Union for a Popular Movement party. She is Puteaux city mayor as well. Ceccaldi-Raynaud's constituency in the department of Hauts-de-Seine had been held by future President Nicolas Sarkozy, and includes the town of Neuilly- sur-Seine, of which he was mayor for many years. When Sarkozy resigned the seat in 2002 to join the Government of Jean-Pierre Raffarin, newly appointed as Prime Minister by President Chirac, Ceccaldi-Raynaud filled the post. Her father, Charles, had held the seat when Sarkozy resigned it a first time in 1993 to join the \u00c9douard Balladur Cabinet. Ceccaldi-Raynaud retired from the National Assembly of France at the 2012 elections ; the assembly's constituencies have been redrawn for that election. ==References== Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:French people of Italian descent Category:People from Algiers Category:Knights of the National Order of Merit (France) Category:Women mayors of places in France Category:The Republicans (France) politicians Category:Women members of the National Assembly (France) Category:Deputies of the 12th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:Deputies of the 13th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:Politicians from \u00cele-de-France ",
