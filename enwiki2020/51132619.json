    "text": "is a downloadable maze arcade game in the Pac-Man series which was released for PlayStation 4, Microsoft Windows, and Xbox One on September 15, 2016; an updated version featuring an exclusive 2-player co-op mode, Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 Plus, was released for Nintendo Switch on February 22, 2018. It was developed and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment, and is a direct sequel to Pac-Man Championship Edition, making it an indirect follow-up Pac-Man Championship Edition DX. ==Gameplay== Pac-Man being pursued by ghosts while eating Pac-Dots. Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 builds upon the gameplay introduced in Championship Edition and Championship Edition DX, which add faster gameplay to the traditional Pac-Man formula. Taking control of Pac-Man, players go through various mazes collecting pellets while avoiding roaming ghosts. Gathering enough pellets reveals either a piece of fruit that sends Pac-Man to the next maze, or a Power Pellet that can be used to eat ghosts. Unlike previous iterations of Pac-Man, in which touching ghosts would instantly kill Pac-Man, ghosts can now be bumped into up to three times in succession before they enter an Angry state, during which touching them will cause Pac-Man to lose a life. Similar to Championship DX, passing by sleeping ghosts will add them to a trail behind the other ghosts, allowing for large point bonuses when eaten. Players can also use jump pads to jump over parts of a maze and bombs to instantly return to the start of a maze. The game features two main modes: Score Attack, in which players must try and rack up a high score within a time limit, and Adventure, which requires players to clear several objectives, including fighting giant bosses.http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pac-man-championship- edition-2-review/1900-6416518/ The Nintendo Switch 'Plus' version also features a co-op mode. ==Reception== Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics according to Metacritic. ==Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 + Arcade Game Series== A retail disc for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One containing Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 compiled with three games from the Arcade Game Series (Pac-Man, Galaga, and Dig Dug) was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on November 1, 2016 in North America. ==Namco Museum Arcade Pac== Namco Museum Arcade Pac is a retail video game compilation for Nintendo Switch that includes Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 Plus along with all of the games included in Namco Museum for Nintendo Switch.http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/07/namco_museum_arcade_pac_is_a_2-in-1_bundle_coming_exclusively_to_switch ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Category:2016 video games Category:Maze games Category:Pac-Man Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Nintendo Switch games ",
