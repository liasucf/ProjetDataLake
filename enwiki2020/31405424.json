He has worked in the areas of control, communication networks and transportation systems. He is the author of High- Performance Communication Networks (with Jean Walrand and Andrea Goldsmith) (2nd edn., Morgan-Kaufmann, 2000). In 1980, Varaiya became a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). In 1999, he was elected to membership of the National Academy of Engineering and in 2006 he became Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2002, he received the IEEE Control Systems Award, \"for outstanding contributions to stochastic and adaptive control and the unification of concepts from control and computer science\". \\- In 2008, he received the Richard E. Bellman Control Heritage Award from the American Automatic Control Council, \"for pioneering contributions to stochastic control, hybrid systems and the unification of theories of control and computation\". Among his students was Jan van Schuppen. ==References== Category:Control theorists Category:American electrical engineers Category:Living people Category:Richard E.
