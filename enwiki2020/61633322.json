    "text": "The 1922 Auckland Rugby League was the 14th in its history. There were 68 teams playing across the various grades. City Rovers won the first grade championship for the 5th time, with Ponsonby winning the Roope Rooster for the 2nd time. City Rovers also defended the Challenge Shield, warding off efforts from Petone, Tongariro, and Huntly to lift it from them. Bill Davidson set a record for points scored in an Auckland club rugby league season with 116 for City Rovers. He and his brothers Ben and George between them scored 186 of City Rover's 339 points which was also a competition record for a team in a single season. City scored a further 19 points in the Roope Rooster competition and 85 points in their 3 Challenge Shield matches for 443 points in all official games. It was an incredibly busy year for the Auckland representative team. They played more matches than some club teams had played in earlier seasons with ten matches in total. There was also an Auckland Provincial team match against New South Wales, and one Auckland B fixture with the team making the trip down to Cambridge to play the local side. Bill Davidson also led the representative team in scoring with 37 points. == Carlaw Park == At a pre-season meeting of the management committee it was discussed that Carlaw Park needed more \u2018modern equipment\u2019, and it was decided that \u201cthe establishment of more modern methods of dealing with the turf and the purchase of more efficient machinery shall be an early charge on the new season's funds\u201d. Sufficient money was made from gates at club and rep fixtures at Carlaw Park and the Auckland Domain to begin improvements on the ground at the conclusion of the season. == New clubs and name changes == The Auckland Rugby League accepted a new club into the fold, named Central Mangere. They entered a team in the 2nd Grade. The Maritime club also changed their name to \u2018Athletics\u2019 and in 1926 they were to change their name again to Grafton Athletic. This was not to be confused with Grafton Athletic who had existed as a team from 1914\u20131920 under the leadership of Karl Ifwersen and were now playing under the name of 'Fire Brigade'. Richmond Rovers applied for entry into the Senior A Grade competition and this was approved. This made the competition an even 8 teams meaning 4 matches per round and no byes. Unlike most previous seasons there were no byes, no defaults, and no postponed matches meaning 56 matches were played in total, easily the most in the competitions history. Richmond would go on to finish 7th with 3 wins and 11 losses. == George Davidson's return == George Davidson played for Maritime (now named Athletics) in the 1919 season but had missed most of the 1920 and 1921 seasons as he was training for and competing at the Antwerp Olympics where he came 5th in the 200m final. He stated that over those two seasons he had only played for Maritime on two or three occasions as he was seeking a transfer to the City Rovers where his two brothers Bill and Ben played. Athletics were denying his request and Davidson appealed to the league who then asked the Athletics club to reconsider his request \"favourably\". He would eventually have his transfer to City approved. == First grade championship == === Final standings === {| |- | {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !width=175 |Team !width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld !width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W !width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D !width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L !width=20 abbr=\"For\" |F !width=20 abbr=\"Against\" |A !width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|City Rovers |14||11||0||3||339||157||22 |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Ponsonby United |14||10||0||4||205||169||20 |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Marist Old Boys |14||9||1||4||258||192||19 |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Devonport United |14||7||1||6||223||194||15 |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Newton Rangers |14||6||1||7||197||219||13 |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Athletic |14||6||0||8||242||208||12 |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Richmond Rovers |14||3||0||11||141||295||6 |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Fire Brigade |14||2||1||11||143||313||5 |- |} === First grade fixtures === ==== Round 1 ==== ==== Round 2 ==== In the match between Athletic and Ponsonby Eric Grey had a highly unusual collection of points after he scored a try, and kicked a conversion, a penalty, a goal from a mark, and a drop goal. Bert Laing transferred to Devonport during the week and had the unusual distinction of scoring against a team and then for a team in the space of a week. ==== Round 3 ==== ==== Round 4 ==== ==== Round 5 ==== ==== Round 6 ==== ==== Round 7 ==== ==== Round 8 ==== ==== Round 9 ==== ==== Round 10 ==== ==== Round 11 ==== ==== Round 12 ==== ==== Round 13 ==== ==== Round 14 ==== ==Roope Rooster knockout competition== ===Round 1=== ===Semi finals=== ===Final=== ==Top try scorers and point scorers== These lists include tries and points scored in the First Grade competition and the Roope Rooster competition only. Ben Davidson set a record for the number of points scored by a single player in a season. While earlier seasons were often incomplete with some points unattributed his 116 points was well ahead of the previous highest of 78 by Karl Ifwersen in the 1915 season. P Gallagher of Marist was the top try scorer with 15. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !Rank!!Player!!Team!!Tries |- |1||P Gallagher||Marist Old Boys||15 |- |2||Ivan Littlewood||Maritime & Ponsonby United||13 |- |3||Ben Davidson||City Rovers||12 |- |4||Stan Webb||Devonport United||11 |- |5||George Davidson||City Rovers||10 |- |5||Eric Grey||Athletic||10 |- |7||Bert Avery||Athletic||9 |- |8||Bill Davidson||City Rovers||8 |- |8||George Yardley||Athletic||8 |- |8||Maurice Wetherill||City Rovers||8 |- |11||Jack Keenan||City Rovers||7 |- |11||Wilson||City Rovers||7 |- |11||Frank Delgrosso||Ponsonby United||7 |- |11||Hanlon||Ponsonby United||7 |- |11||James Hing||Ponsonby United||7 |- |11||Arthur Singe||Marist Old Boys||7 |- |11||Wareing||Fire Brigade||7 |- |11||Little||Richmond Rovers||7 |- |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !Rank!!Player!!Team!!Tries!!Con!!Pen!!Mark!!Drop Goal!!Points |- |1||Bill Davidson||City Rovers||8||33||13||0||0||116 |- |2||Eric Grey||Athletic||10||10||4||1||5||70 |- |3||Thomas McClymont||Ponsonby United||6||18||1||0||0||56 |- |4||Wareing||Fire Brigade||7||6||11||0||0||55 |- |5||Clarrie Polson||Newton Rangers||5||12||4||0||0||47 |- |5||P Gallagher||Marist Old Boys||15||1||0||0||0||47 |- |7||Ivan Littlewood||Athletic & Ponsonby United||13||1||0||0||0||41 |- |8||Ben Davidson||City Rovers||12||1||0||0||1||40 |- |8||George Yardley||Athletic||8||5||3||0||0||40 |- |10||Maurice Wetherill||City Rovers||8||5||2||0||0||38 |- |} == Challenge shield matches == City Rovers came into the season as holders of the trophy after defeating Ponsonby United the previous season. The shield had taken the place of the Thacker Shield which had been taken from Ponsonby and returned to the Canterbury Rugby League after a dispute over who was eligible to compete for it. City went on to defend the shield 3 times during the season defeating Petone, Tongariro, and Huntly. ===City v Petone=== ===City v Tongariro=== The Tongariro team was \u201cmade up of Maori players drawn from the scattered settlements of the King Country\u201d according to the New Zealand Herald match report, though were missing some of their best players. The Auckland Star reported that many of their players were graduates of Te Aute College. ===City v Huntly=== Huntly came to Auckland as the South Auckland (Waikato) champions and were expected to provide a stern test to City however after a competitive first half they fell away badly in the second half with City ending up running in 11 tries. == Lower grades == === Lower grade clubs === There were 6 lower grades in 1922 if you include the Sixth Grade which was split into an A and B grade. Grades were made of the following teams with the winning team in bold: *Second Grade: Athletics, City, Devonport United, Ihumatao (misspelt as 'Ihumata' in the Newspapers), Mangere, Manukau, Newton, Northcote, Otahuhu, Ponsonby, Richmond, (City defeated Devonport 16\u201313 in the final). *Third Grade Myers Cup: Athletics, City A, City B, Coromandel, Devonport, Ellerslie, Kingsland, Manukau, Newton, Northcote, Parnell, Point Chevalier, Ponsonby (undefeated), and Richmond. *Fourth Grade: Athletics, City, Devonport United, Ellerslie, Newton, Otahuhu, Parnell, Ponsonby, and Richmond. *Fifth Grade Endean Memorial Shield: Devonport, Marist Old Boys, Marist Old Boys, Manukau, Newton, Northcote, Ponsonby, Richmond, and Takapuna. *Sixth Grade A: City, Athletics A, Athletics B, Ellerslie, Kingsland, Manukau A, Manukau B, Northcote, Otahuhu, Parnell, Ponsonby, Richmond *Sixth Grade B: Athletics, City, Manukau, Marist Old Boys, Northcote, Parnell, Richmond *Cadet Competition: Athletic Cadets, 22nd (Eden) Company, 26th Company, 29th Company, 36th (Northcote) Company == Representative season == It was an extremely busy season for the Auckland representative side. They played ten matches in total, while many members of the side also played for the Auckland Provincial team, and an Auckland B team also played a match in Cambridge. Of the ten matches they lost 6 and won 4. The first representative fixture of the season was played on 20 May between Auckland and the Maori team which was preparing to visit Australia and play a series of matches. There were 7,000 in attendance and gate receipts totaled \u00a3297 2s 6d. On 19 June the touring Australian Universities Rugby League team arrived in Auckland on board the \u2018Manuka\u2019. They were welcomed at a function at the Auckland Town Hall by a large assembly of Auckland politicians including the Mayor Mr. J.H. Gunson, and representatives of Auckland Rugby League and the New Zealand League Council. The Australians acquitted themselves well by beating Auckland twice, and losing to them once and a loss to the South Waikato team in Hamilton. The games were played over the space of just 8 days. After the NZ M\u0101ori team returned from their tour of Australia seven members of their team were transferred to the Fire Brigade Club, though only four played in their round 9 match (Pitman, Gardner, Yeats and Te Whata). History was made on 2 September when Auckland was defeated for the first time in a Northern Union Challenge Cup match. They had held the Cup for over a decade, but had to hand it over when they were defeated by South Auckland 21 to 20 on Carlaw Park in front of a large crowd. On 16 September they met the touring New South Wales team at the Auckland Domain and in front of a huge crowd of 20,000 they went down in a \u201ctremendously fast and exciting game\u201d by 45 points to 25. ===Auckland v New Zealand Maori=== ===Auckland v Australian Universities=== The Australian University team was made up of players from Sydney University and Brisbane University. ===Auckland v Australian Universities=== ===Auckland v Australian Universities=== ===Auckland v Cambridge=== ===Auckland v Hawkes Bay (Northern Union Challenge Cup)=== ===Cambridge v Auckland B=== ===Auckland v South Auckland (Northern Union Challenge Cup)=== ===Auckland v New South Wales=== Auckland played the touring New South Wales team in front of 20,000 spectators at the Auckland Domain but was heavily defeated with Australian legend Frank Burge running in 5 tries. ===Auckland Province v New South Wales=== A few days after the match with New South Wales an Auckland provincial team took on the touring side. The Auckland team was largely made up of Auckland club players but also included Bill Te Whata who had played in Australia for the New Zealand M\u0101ori side, and a handful of others from the Waikato. They lost a tight match by 21 points to 20. Frank Burge was ordered off for disputing Wilson's try late in the match. ===South Auckland v Auckland (Northern Union Challenge Cup)=== ===Bay of Plenty v Auckland=== ==Auckland representative matches played and scorers== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !No!!Name!!Club Team!!Play!!Tries!!Con!!Pen!!Mark!!Points |- |1||Bill Davidson||City Rovers||6||5||7||3||1||37 |- |2||Craddock Dufty||Athletic||4||2||5||4||0||24 |- |2||Bert Avery||Athletic||8||8||0||0||0||24 |- |4||Nelson Bass||Marist Old Boys||7||6||1||0||0||20 |- |4||George Davidson||City Rovers||6||6||1||0||0||20 |- |6||Clarrie Polson||Newton Rangers||8||3||5||0||0||19 |- |7||Lou Brown||Newton Rangers||4||6||0||0||0||18 |- |8||Maurice Wetherill||City Rovers||9||4||2||0||0||16 |- |9||Eric Grey||Athletic||1||3||0||0||0||9 |- |10||Bert Laing||Devonport United||5||2||1||0||0||8 |- |11||H Hawkes||City Rovers||8||2||0||0||0||6 |- |11||John Lang||Marist Old Boys||4||2||0||0||0||6 |- |11||Ivan Littlewood||Ponsonby United||5||2||0||0||0||6 |- |11||M Webb||Athletic||1||0||2||1||0||6 |- |15||Sam Lowrie||Ponsonby United||2||1||1||0||0||5 |- |16||Arthur Singe||Marist Old Boys||5||0||1||1||0||4 |- |17||Frank Delgrosso||Ponsonby United||4||1||0||0||0||3 |- |17||Wally Somers||Newton Rangers||7||1||0||0||0||3 |- |17||Ben Davidson||City Rovers||3||1||0||0||0||3 |- |17||F Wilson||City Rovers||2||1||0||0||0||3 |- |17||Nelson||Marist Old Boys||1||1||0||0||0||3 |- |17||J Johnson||Devonport United||2||1||0||0||0||3 |- |23||Bill Stormont||Marist Old Boys||6||0||1||0||0||2 |- |23||Stan Webb||Devonport United||2||0||1||0||0||2 |- |23||Thomas McClymont||Ponsonby United||3||0||0||1||0||2 |- |23||W Flynn||Athletic||1||0||1||0||0||2 |- |27||F Turner||Marist Old Boys||2||0||0||0||0||0 |- |27||Charles Woolley||Fire Brigade||2||0||0||0||0||0 |- |27||Ernie Herring||Fire Brigade||2||0||0||0||0||0 |- |27||J McGregor||Athletic||2||0||0||0||0||0 |- |27||W Hanlon||Ponsonby United||2||0||0||0||0||0 |- |27||Harry Douglas||Devonport United||2||0||0||0||0||0 |- |27||P Gallagher||Marist Old Boys||1||0||0||0||0||0 |- |27||George Duane||Marist Old Boys||1||0||0||0||0||0 |- |27||Alf Townsend||City Rovers||1||0||0||0||0||0 |- |27||Joe Meadows||Ponsonby United||1||0||0||0||0||0 |- |27||C Nicholson||Newton Rangers||1||0||0||0||0||0 |- |27||G Reid||City Rovers||1||0||0||0||0||0 |- |27||Harrison||Devonport United||1||0||0||0||0||0 |- |27||Scott||Devonport United||1||0||0||0||0||0 |- |27||Mackie||Fire Brigade||1||0||0||0||0||0 |- |27||Mitchell||City Rovers||1||0||0||0||0||0 |- |27||Charles Hand||Devonport United||1||0||0||0||0||0 |- |27||Neville St George||Devonport United||1||0||0||0||0||0 |- |27||Jim O'Brien||Devonport United||1||0||0||0||0||0 |- |} == References == == External links == * Auckland Rugby League Official Site Category:Auckland Rugby League seasons Auckland Rugby League ",
