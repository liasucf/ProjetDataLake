    "text": "Tomislav Krizman (1882\u20131955), was a Croatian painter, graphic artist, costume and set designer, teacher, author and organizer of cultural events. He painted in oils and tempera, although he is principally remembered for his remarkable graphic art. He was of the founders of the Meduli\u0107 Society, and the Zagreb Spring Salon of 1916. He exhibited in Zagreb, Belgrade, Ljubljana, Vienna, Paris and Rome. == Biography == Tomislav Krizman was born on 21 July 1882 in Orlovac (now part of Karlovac). He attended the Commerce Academy (Trgova\u010dka akademija), while also studying painting and drawing with Bela \u010ciko\u0161 Sesija, Robert Auer and Menci Clement Crn\u010di\u0107. From 1903 to 1907 he went to Vienna, where he attended the School of Crafts and Academy of Fine Arts studying with William Unger. Krizman remained in Vienna for ten years, an important time in his artistic development, spending time with other artists of the avant-garde secession. He incorporated their ideas into his own art, and participated in the group exhibitions Hagenbund, Jungbund, K\u00fcnstlerhaus and Secesija (\"Secession\"). From 1912, Krizman worked in Zagreb, first as a teacher at the Arts and Crafts School (\u0160kola primijenjene umjetnosti i dizajna), then from 1922 in the Graphics Department of the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb. He died on 24 October 1955 in Zagreb. == Legacy == Krizman is principally remembered for his remarkable graphic work. He loved to travel, and draw what he saw: views of Vienna, Hrvatsko Zagorje, Bosnia, and Dalmatia. His unusual views of Bosnia, Hercegovina, Kosovo and Macedonia are very evocative and fresh. He created some memorable portraits, including Mary Delvarda, Portret djevoj\u010dice (\"Portrait of a Girl\"), Autoportret (\"Self-portrait\"), Me\u0161trovi\u0107 and Brat Hinko (\"Brother Hinko\"). His knowledge of graphic techniques was published in a book \"On Graphical Arts\" (O grafi\u010dkim vje\u0161tinama), (1952). He wrote books and magazine articles and worked as a costume and set designer for opera and drama. The appearance of posters corresponds with the emergence of the secession or art nouveau movements that arrived in Zagreb in 1898. The poster was a popular image form of the new era, and Tomislav Krizman created memorable poster art for various events of culture, sports, entertainment, and politics. One of his first posters was of the cabaret singer Marya Delvard, who had delighted audience in Vienna and Munich before arriving in Zagreb in 1907. Krizman's image perfectly captured the essential femme-fatale type of art nouveau woman. ==Works== * Portrait of Marya Delvard * Portrait of a Girl (Portret djevoj\u010dice) * Self-portrait (Autoportret) * Portrait of Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107 * Brother Hinko (Brat Hinko) * A Street in Ohrid (Ulica u Ohridu), 1930 * Travel drawings and etchings ==Exhibitions== ===Solo shows=== Recent solo exhibitions include * 1995 Tomislav Krizman retrospektivna izlo\u017eba - Art Pavilion, Zagreb ===Group shows=== During his lifetime, Krizman exhibited with the Meduli\u0107 Society, and the Spring Salon.
