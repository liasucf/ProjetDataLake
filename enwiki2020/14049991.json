    "text": "Suddenly is the fifth studio album by British recording artist Billy Ocean, released in 1984. It featured his first major U.S. pop hit single \"Caribbean Queen (No More Love on the Run)\", which reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 record chart. Prior to that, his biggest success in the U.S. charts had been a #22 placing for \"Love Really Hurts Without You\" in 1976, which was one of a number of British hits he had achieved by the release of this album. Despite these earlier hits, Suddenly became Ocean's first charting album in the UK, reaching #9 on the UK Album Chart. It also reached #9 in the US, and produced two additional US Top Five singles in the title track and \"Loverboy\". \"Caribbean Queen\" and \"Suddenly\" were also top ten hits on the UK Singles Chart. ==Track listing== All songs written by Keith Diamond and Billy Ocean, except where noted. # \"Caribbean Queen (No More Love on the Run)\" - 5:04 # \"Mystery Lady\" (Diamond, Ocean, James Woodley) - 5:02 # \"Syncopation\" (Diamond, Ocean, Jolyon Skinner) - 5:20 # \"The Long and Winding Road\" (John Lennon, Paul McCartney) - 4:40 # \"Loverboy\" (Diamond, Ocean, Robert Lange) - 5:16 # \"Lucky Man\" - 4:21 # \"Dancefloor\" (Diamond, Ocean, Barry J.
