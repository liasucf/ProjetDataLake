It was the primary basketball venue in Istanbul for two decades and hosted many (mostly the international) games of Istanbul's four top basketball clubs Anandolu Efes, Fenerbah\u00e7e, Galatasaray and Besiktas, as well as many other sports events and concerts. However, its significance declined after the opening of Sinan Erdem Dome in 2010, which surpassed Abdi \u0130pek\u00e7i Arena as the biggest and most state of the art arena in Istanbul. === Closure === After the 2016/2017 season, the arena was closed. It got demolished in early 2018. In its place, a basketball training and performance center is to be built. Basketball teams Anadolu Efes and Galatasaray are now playing their games at Sinan Erdem Dome beginning with the 2017/18 season. Galatasaray also plans to move into a newly built own arena in the coming years. Fenerbah\u00e7e already moved into their own \u00dclker Sports Arena in 2012. ==Facilities== The arena had an audience seating capacity of 12,270. It hosted national and international sports events, such as basketball, volleyball, wrestling, and weightlifting, as well as concerts and congresses, among other events. The facility contained a multi-faced visual scoreboard, six online-system counters, four locker rooms, two internet rooms, a press room, two multi-purpose offices, VIP rooms, etc. Its parking lot had a capacity of 1,500 cars. ==Events== The professional basketball teams of Galatasaray men's basketball team and Galatasaray women's basketball team played their Turkish League home matches since the 2009\u201310 season in the Abdi \u0130pek\u00e7i Arena.
