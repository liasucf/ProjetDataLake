    "text": "The King Clancy Memorial Trophy is a sports award given annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) player who best exemplifies leadership qualities on and off the ice and who has made a significant humanitarian contribution to his community. The winner is chosen by \"a special panel of representatives\" from the Professional Hockey Writers' Association and the NHL Broadcasters' Association. The trophy is named in honour of Francis M. \"King\" Clancy, a former player for the original Ottawa Senators and the Toronto Maple Leafs who later went on to become a coach, referee, and team executive. The trophy was first awarded in 1988 and was presented to the NHL by Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard, who called Clancy \"one of the greatest humanitarians that ever lived\". It honours similar community service as the Charlie Conacher Humanitarian Award, which was retired in 1984. Five teams have had more than one player win the award. Three members of the Vancouver Canucks, Edmonton Oilers, Calgary Flames, and Boston Bruins have each won the award, with Ray Bourque and Dave Poulin winning the award in consecutive years for the same team for the only time in the history of the award. Two New York Islanders and Detroit Red Wings have also won the award. Players from the seven different Canadian teams have won the trophy on 12 of the 28 occasions that it has been awarded. Three members each from the Edmonton Oilers, Calgary Flames, and Vancouver Canucks, two from the Minnesota Wild, as well as one each from the Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, and the original Winnipeg Jets have each won the award. Henrik Sedin is the only player who has won it more than once. Henrik and his brother Daniel are the only recipients to have won the trophy jointly. == Winners == Matt Dumba, 2020 winner Jason Zucker, 2019 winner {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !scope=\"col\"| Season !scope=\"col\"| Winner !scope=\"col\"| Team !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Player's humanitarian contribution |- | | |Calgary Flames |Supporter of numerous charities in Toronto and Calgary. |- | | |New York Islanders |Worked with numerous charities, including the Special Olympics, the Long Island \"Just Say No to Drugs\" program, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation. |- | | |Edmonton Oilers |Although very busy as a player and with the NHLPA, he was made the honorary Chairman of the Edmonton City Christmas Bureau, a charity which fed needy persons. |- | | | Los Angeles Kings |Did a lot of charity work with his team, and also assisted persons with speech impediments, as he had previously overcome one. |- | | | Boston Bruins |Involved in numerous charities; he was most notably the honourable Chairman for Boston's Floating Hospital for Infants and Children. |- | | | Boston Bruins |Spent a lot of time helping charities; he was Co-Chairman of the March of Dimes \"Walk for Life\" fundraiser. |- | | |New York Rangers |Was previously recognized by his team and city for his extensive community work.
