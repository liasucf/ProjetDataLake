    "text": "The Ca\u00f1ad\u00f3n Calc\u00e1reo Formation is an Oxfordian to Kimmeridgian-aged geologic formation, from the Ca\u00f1ad\u00f3n Asfalto Basin in Chubut Province, Argentina, a rift basin that started forming since the earliest Jurassic.Figari et al., 2015, p.142 It was formerly thought to date into the Cretaceous, but the age has been revised with Uranium Lead dating as likely being solely Late Jurassic in age. It is a subunit of the Sierra de Olte Group, close to the city Cerro Condor in the Chubut Province of northwestern Patagonia, in southern Argentina. The formation is composed primarily of fluvial sandstones alongside shales and volcanic tuffites The formation preserves fishes, crocodylomorphs and some dinosaur taxa, as well as conifers. == Geology == The Ca\u00f1ad\u00f3n Calc\u00e1reo Formation is composed mainly of fluvial deposits, that are found close to the Ca\u00f1ad\u00f3n Asfalto Formation. While originally thought to be part of the Ca\u00f1ad\u00f3n Asfalto, there is a lack of calcareous rocks, and the geologic faulting and folding is weaker. The Ca\u00f1ad\u00f3n Calc\u00e1reo Formation is overlain by the Chubut Group, the rocks of which lack synsedimentary deformation. The area of the Ca\u00f1ad\u00f3n Calc\u00e1reo also includes lacustrine and palustrine rocks, including shales, pelites, psammites and coarse clastics. === Age === The age of the Ca\u00f1ad\u00f3n Calc\u00e1reo Formation was originally presumed to be Late Jurassic, probably Kimmeridgian to Tithonian in age. However, it has also been suggested to span the entire Late Jurassic, beginning in the Oxfordian, although this could also be because of the uncertainty of the youngest age Ca\u00f1ad\u00f3n Asfalto Formation. A 2009 study of the palynology from a section of the formation revealed an age that was Hauterivian, which suggests that the formation extends from the Late Jurassic into the Early Cretaceous. == Dinosaurs == An unnamed brachiosaurid sauropod is also known from the Ca\u00f1ad\u00f3n Calc\u00e1reo Formation. It is known from a single humerus. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\" | Dinosaurs reported from the Ca\u00f1ad\u00f3n Calc\u00e1reo Formation |- ! Genus ! Species !
