He and his ex-prostitute lover Rose Slater also have moved into the Grayson manor, childhood home of Rockwell Grayson, who has been away fighting in the war. After ostensibly going to see inspector general Hildebrandt to request he investigate Hale's activities, Rock instead returns to form an alliance with Hale, offering to become his tax collector and siding with him publicly against the townspeople. Jane Colfax, his former sweetheart, is shocked by Rock's behavior, as are others. Rose's greed leads her to purchase a nearby plantation with Hale's ill-gotten gains and offer to cut Rock in on their profits. She also persuades Hale to sign a document bequeathing his possessions to her should anything happen to him. Rock is revealed to be working undercover on the general's behalf, gaining information to use against Hale. A former union officer, Kirby, learns of Rock's real mission. Rock is shot and reveals his true purpose to Jane, who forgives him and threatens Rose with a pair of scissors. Rose then shoots Hale, possibly by mistake, possibly not. Rock gets the better of Kirby and reunites with Jane. == Cast == *John Payne as Rockwell 'Rock' Grayson *Jan Sterling as Rose Slater *Coleen Gray as Jane Colfax *Lyle Bettger as Roger Hale *Willard Parker as Captain Kirby *Roy Gordon as Doctor Colfax *John Dierkes as General Morris *Charles Evans as General Hildebrandt *Strother Martin as Scott *Ellen Corby as Mrs. Barbour *Ernestine Barrier as Mrs. Colfax *Russell Gaige as Reverend Babcock *Leslie Kimmell as Colonel Ellansby *Voltaire Perkins as Harvey Giddens *Sam Flint as Connors *Freeman Morse as Randy Williams *Denver Pyle as Fairchild *Richard Shannon as Lieutenant Adams *Karen Sharpe as Lucy Colfax ==Production== In May 1951 Pine-Thomas Productions signed a contract with Paramount to turn out at least eight films in 1952 and 1953.
