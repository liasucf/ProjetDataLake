English Nature reports that it was originally a mere within a glacial hollow; since the 17th century the water has become filled with vegetation creating a raised peat bog. Adders can be found on the site. Neighbouring sites such as White Moss have been excavated for commercial peat production. ==See also== *St Luke's Church, Oakhanger ==External links== * Category:Villages in Cheshire ",
