The name may refer to a river named Spalding, derived from the Old English spald \"ditch or fenland river\", which also gave its name to Spalding Moor. The River Spalding is not recorded, but would be the river now known as the River Foulness. The name may also be derived from the tribe known as the Spalda mentioned in the 7th century Tribal Hidage, which gave rise to the tribe or district known as the Spaldingas, the \"dwellers by the Spald\". If that explanation is correct, Spald could refer to some other fenland river or rivers. The Spaldingas also gave their name to the town of Spalding in Lincolnshire. Spaldington (Spellinton) was listed as being in the manor of Wressle (Weresa) in the Domesday Book of 1086. In around 1200 Eustace de Vesci and William Fitzpeter were joint lords of the manor; after de Vesci's death the manorship passed to Fitzpeter, then to his sister, to her eldest daughter who had married Peter dela Haye, then to the Vasavour's by the marriage of Isabella de la Haye to John Vavasour, father of John Vavasour died 1506.
