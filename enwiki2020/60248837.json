Phillips was born in Hove, Sussex, in around 1900. He played for Brighton & Hove Amateurs during and after the First World War, and turned professional with Albion in 1920. He was a member of their reserve team that won the 1920\u201321 Southern League title, and made his debut in the Football League in September 1921. Illness put an end to his football career during the following season, and he died in Hove in March 1924 at the age of 23. Albion's reserves played a benefit match against Southampton in support of his family. ==References== Category:1900 births Category:1924 deaths Category:People from Hove Category:English footballers Category:Association football fullbacks Category:Association football outside forwards Category:Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Southern Football League players ",
