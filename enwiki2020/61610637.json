He established his own company in 1882, which had by the 1890s developed into the largest company of its kind in Denmark. Its former headquarters is located at Skindergade 45-47 in Copenhagen. The current building is from 1900. ==Early life and education== Bestle was born on 18 March 1855 in Copenhagen, the son of vintner Christopher Wilhelm Friderich Bestle (1821\u201392) and Trine Marie Engelsen (1826\u201398). His father had in 1853 acquired a wine house which traced its history back to 1730. Bestle apprenticed as a wine merchant in his father's company from 1870 and then continued his education abroad where he spent most of his time in Bordeaux. ==Career== Georg Bestle's former building at Skindergade 45-47 in Copenhagen Bestle was licensed as a vintner in 1882 and purchased a minor wine store in N\u00f8rre Voldgade.

His wine house experienced a commercial breakthrough in 1888 and over the next few years developed into the largest company of its kind in Denmark. Hans Christian Rodian (1854\u20131919) was a key employee. He took over his father's wine company in 1892 and merged it with his existing operations in Skindergade.

Bestle was also chairman of United Wine Import, a company founded in 1919 through the merger of Georg Bestle and Riis & Dreyers vinhandel. In 1891\u20131906, he was also a board member of the Danish Vintners' Association (Vinhandlerforeningen for Danmark). His company later relocated to modern premises at Meterbuen 24-28 in Skovlunde. ==Other activities== Georg Bestle was interested in the preservation of historic buildings.

He succeeded his father as member of the Irkeinspektionen for Hellig\u00e5ndskirken and though a number of donations contributed significantly to its interior decoration. He was also a board member of Aktieselskabet til oprettelsen af billige pantel\u00e5nerkontorer i K\u00f8benhavn and a driving force behind the establishment of nderst\u00f8ttelsesfondet in 1924.
