Its population centre was the town of Deloraine in Tasmania's north-east between the centres of Launceston and Devonport. The seat was created ahead of the Assembly's first election held in 1856, and was abolished when the Tasmanian parliament adopted the Hare-Clark electoral model in 1909. ==Members for Deloraine== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Member!!Term |- | Adolphus Rooke | 1856\u20131862 |- | John Meredith | 1862\u20131863 |- | Charles Grant | 1863\u20131866 |- | William Archer | 1866\u20131868 |- | Adolphus Rooke | 1868\u20131869 |- | Henry Douglas | 1869\u20131871 |- | Samuel Shorey | 1871\u20131872 |- | Samuel Henry | 1872\u20131880 |- | William Sleigh | 1880\u20131882 |- | Henry Rooke | 1882\u20131886 |- | John Hart | 1886\u20131893 |- | Norman Cameron | 1893\u20131894 |- | Jonathan Best | 1894\u20131897 |- | Norman Cameron | 1897\u20131899 |- | Jonathan Best | 1899\u20131909 |} ==References== * * * Parliament of Tasmania (2006).
