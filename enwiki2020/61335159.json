The center piece of the park is the approximately Pisgah View Ranch, which has rental cabins, equestrian trails, a swimming pool, tennis courts and other amenities. The ranch has been privately owned by the Cogburn Family since the late 1700s, and the state acquired an option to purchase the property over a five year period. The Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy has raised $1 million to aid with the purchase. The Cogburns will donate a portion of the land's value to the state. ==History== The North Carolina General Assembly authorized Pisgah View State Park on July 19, 2019.
