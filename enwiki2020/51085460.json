Charles de Schomberg is best known for his victory against the Spanish at the Battle of Leucate on 28 September 1637. Following this victory, he was made a Marshal of France. He was Governor of Languedoc between 1633 and 1644. Then he became Governor of the Citadel of Metz and of the Trois-\u00c9v\u00each\u00e9s between 1644 and his death in 1656. He was also Colonel-general of the Cent-Suisses et Grisons between 1647 and 1656. He first married Anne, Duchess d'Halluin, who had divorced Henry de Nogaret de La Valette. This made him Duke of Halluin, but Henry de Nogaret de La Valette also kept his title, which led to complicated situations at the French Court. Anne died without children in November 1641. Charles de Schomberg remarried on 24 September 1646 with Marie de Hautefort (1616\u20131691), Lady-in-waiting of Queen Anne of Austria and former confidante of King Louis XIII of France.Jacques Magne, Marie de Hautefort, le grand amour de Louis XIII, They had no children. == References == Category:1601 births Category:1666 deaths Category:People of the Ancien R\u00e9gime Category:French generals Category:Marshals of France Category:Peers created by Louis XIII ",
