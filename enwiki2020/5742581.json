    "text": "Doyleston is a minor Canterbury town in the South Island of New Zealand. It was named after Joseph Hastings Doyle, a publican from Christchurch who moved to the locality. Doyleston promised to be one of the main townships in the Ellesmere area, but before long Leeston overtook it and some businesses moved there. Doyleston had a school for many years, but it consolidated with Leeston School in the late 1930s. Doyleston featured a hall on the main street (the second on the site), but partly due to a car crash it was pulled down, making way for new housing. Doyleston's main attraction now is Osborne Park, which has been the centre for junior football in Ellesmere for a number of years. ==References== == External links == * Doyleston at the Selwyn District Council Category:Selwyn District Category:Populated places in Canterbury, New Zealand ",
