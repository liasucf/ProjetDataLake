    "text": "Marinduque's at-large congressional district, also known as Marinduque's lone district, is the sole congressional district of the Philippines in the province of Marinduque. Marinduque has been represented in the country's various national legislatures since 1898. The first congressional delegation consisted of two members in the First Philippine Republic legislature known as the Malolos Congress. Since 1922 when it was re-established as a regular province separate from Tayabas, Marinduque has been entitled to one member in the House of Representatives of the Philippines, elected provincewide at- large, except for a brief period between 1943 and 1944 when it was again eliminated and included as part of Tayabas's at-large representation for the National Assembly of the Second Philippine Republic. The district is currently represented by Lord Allan Jay Velasco of the PDP\u2013Laban. ==Representation history== {| class=wikitable |- ! rowspan=2 | # ! colspan=2 | Term of office ! rowspan=2 | National Assembly | rowspan=2 | ! colspan=4 | Seat A | rowspan=2 | ! colspan=4 | Seat B |- style=\"height:3em\" !Start!!End ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | Member !
