It was commissioned by Associated Rediffusion. It was directed by Ray Memnuir who had recently returned to Australia after several years in London. Scenes were shot on Sydney's North Shore, the Cahill Expressway, a Sydney beach, and the Harbour Bridge. It was telerecorded and later shown in London by Associated- Rediffusion. It was the first of a series of exchange programs between the ABC and the British television company. ==Reception== Rod Serling saw the play and disliked the script but praised the acting. The TV critic from the Sydney Morning Herald said \"there was polish in the filming and the script\" of The Right Thing but \"the fun is wearing a little thin... The insistence on heavily accented Australiana may be more acceptable to overseas audiences than home viewers but the comedy was very well handled.\" The Sunday Sydney Morning Herald called it \"one of the biggest turkeys the ABC has given us this season... a dreary and slow moving 90 minutes... almost redeemed by the first class acting of its stars.\" The Bulletin wrote that in the play \"Australians are pre-1939 characters who drive 1963 cars and live in contemporary homes. The males are Flintstones; publicans and beach boys in conflict with a kind of supple European valor which baffles them, though the girls understand it well enough.... A ll of the players acted splendidly to the script, and with an English television showing lined up, Raymond Menmuir and his crew were able to step beyond the usual confines and do a fine indoors-outdoors production.\" ==See also== *List of television plays broadcast on Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1960s) ==References== ==External links== *The Right Thing at IMDb Category:1960s Australian television plays Category:1963 television plays Category:Australian films ",
