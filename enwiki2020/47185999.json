In most cases, he couldn't find any that were \"motivating\". At the time, he had just finished directing Chain Letter, an independent horror film. It didn't \"hit [Taylor]\" the way he wanted, and Taylor claimed the only thing he learned from Chain Letter was \"how to shoot [a film] quickly with no money\". While in Los Angeles, Taylor met with producer Vincent Cirrincione, who was \"a fan of [his] work at the time\". Cirrincione said he had \"this script\", but \"didn't know\" if it was right for Taylor because it was \"one of those movies that could go either way\". Taylor asked for the script and read it while flying back to Sacramento. He claimed to have called Cirrincione \"immediately\" after landing, and asked for a \"few more days to wrap [his] head around the project\". After reading the script a \"few more times\", Taylor \"fell in love with [the] movie\" and \"called [Cirrincione] back\". After \"[making] a deal\" with Cirrincione, Taylor had to find a producer willing to finance the film; he \"ended up finding about a million dollars\". ===Background research=== Taylor stated he \"spoke with the family\" that was taken hostage; having an \"incredible conversation\" with them about everything that \"went down\". He didn't \"have enough time\" to speak with Scully; who was on \"death row\" at the time, so he \"couldn't get [an] entire story\". Taylor said he \"[solely] went with the family's perspective\" because it was all \"[he could] do\". ===Screenplay=== The screenplay was written by Eric J. Adams, an award-winning producer, writer and journalist. Adams also co-wrote Archie's Final Project (aka My Suicide), winner of 21 major international film festival awards including the Crystal Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival. === Casting === Anderson, Glover, and Dawn Olivieri were the first to be cast; the announcement was made on February 9, 2012 by Indiewire.Obenson, Tambay A.\"Danny Glover Set To Star In Indie Based On Real Story Of White Supremacist Who Takes Black Family Hostage\", Indiewire, published 02-09-2012.

Retrieved 11-02-2015. ===Principal photography=== Taylor couldn't achieve the \"look [he] wanted\" with an \"HD camera\", so he shot the movie on 16 mm film instead. Reportedly expensive, Taylor had to consult \"all of the producers\" beforehand, and although he didn't \"have enough money\" to use 16 mm film as much as he wanted, he did have enough to shoot \"one or two takes\" of each scene and \"move on\". Due to time constraints, principal photography lasted just 17 days.Meyer, Carla. \"Fear, racial tension fuel new film \u2018Supremacy\u2019\", The Sacramento Bee, published 02-02-2015. Retrieved 10-29-2015. The ethnic slur \"nigger\" is used heavily in the film; this caused \"one day\" of \"really tough\" filming for Taylor. The first day of principal photography involved a scene where \"a black teenager, a young black baby, and Danny Glover\" are all threatened with a gun; while being referred to as \"niggers\". Taylor said it was \"very difficult to work\" this way, and he had to sit down with each of the actors and explain to them what was going to happen beforehand. According to Taylor, it took \"a few days\" for everyone to \"[get] into a rhythm\". ==Release== The worldwide premiere took place at the Los Angeles Film Festival on June 12, 2014;Obenson, Tambay A.. \"Danny Glover, Evan Ross, Lela Rochon Are A Family Held Hostage By A White Supremacist In Trailer For 'Supremacy'\", Indiewire, published 05-07-2014.
