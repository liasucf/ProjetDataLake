    "text": "Sikhotealinia is a genus of beetle containing a single species, Sikhotealinia zhiltzovae, the only living representative of the family Jurodidae. It was discovered in the Sikhote-Alin mountains in Outer Manchuria. This \"living fossil\" is unique in having three ocelli on their forehead, a condition otherwise unknown in the entire order Coleoptera, whether extinct or living - though it is common in other orders, and generally considered a groundplan character for neopteran insects. Sikhotealinia and its extinct relative Jurodes are considered as a sister group to all other archostematan beetles. ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Illustration * Most mysterious representative of beetles - Sikhotealinia zhiltzovae Lafer, 1996 Photos Category:Archostemata Category:Monotypic Archostemata genera ",
