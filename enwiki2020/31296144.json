Widlak has been married for ten years to a woman, Lale. However, someone in the local Polish community, later revealed it was attorney Christopher Kurczaba,https://huffingtonpost.com/faith- cheltenham/will-a-bisexual-journalis_b_4222625.html reportedly went to authorities and claimed that Ivo and Lale were in a sham marriage, and that Ivo was in fact homosexual. The Widlaks are not a same-sex couple, so they do not fall under the protection of a recent executive order that President Obama signed in September 2012. That order stated that foreigners in a same-sex relationship with an American citizen have the same anti-deportation protections as foreigners married to an American citizen.http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/12/14/polish-journalist-says-he-risks- being-deported-from-usa-for-being-bisexual-and-not- gay/https://huffingtonpost.com/faith-cheltenham/the-curious-case-of-ivo- widlak_b_2317756.html ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Ivo Widlak on Facebook *Ivo Widlak on Twitter Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:People from Knur\u00f3w Category:People from Chicago Category:Polish emigrants to the United States Category:American television reporters and correspondents Category:American male journalists Category:Journalists from Illinois Category:American people of Polish descent Category:Polish American Category:Polish journalists ",
