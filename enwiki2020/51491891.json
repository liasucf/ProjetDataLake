The special won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program. It was followed by Cathy's Last Resort (1988) and Cathy's Valentine (1989). ==Plot== Cathy Andrews is an unmarried woman who dreams of having both a career as president of a conglomerate and a relationship with \"Mr. Right,\" a man who is sensitive, nurturing and sexy. While claiming the 1980s are a golden age to be single, she is envious seeing her friends becoming engaged in droves. She justifies her casual relationship with a man named Irving to her mother, but everyone is disappointed Irving will not be attending her workplace awards ceremony, where Cathy is nominated for employee of the year. One Saturday night, she visits Irving's apartment, to find he is entertaining another woman, Brenda. Although both women storm out on Irving, Cathy returns, and Irving attempts to explain himself. Despite momentarily thinking the affair was brief, Cathy looks into Irving's refrigerator and finds butter on a plate, lasagna and ice trays filled, and realizes it has gone on for weeks. Cathy's friend Andrea takes her out to look for another man, despite her mother's insistence she stay in the apartment and wait for Irving to call. When Cathy returns, she is disappointed to find her answering machine blank. After a failed attempt to look through personal ads, she accepts a blind date, but Andrea drives the man away with mace when he arrives, sees them both, and jokes about having two women. When Irving calls to get his possessions back, Cathy tells him to meet her at the awards ceremony, where she wins employee of the year. They then dance. ==Voices== ==Production== Cathy Guisewite with her Emmy Award. At the time a Cathy special was announced, the comic strip was being published in 500 newspapers.
