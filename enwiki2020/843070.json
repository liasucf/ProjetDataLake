    "text": "Alan Warner (born 1964) is a Scottish novelist who grew up in Connel, near Oban. His notable novels include Morvern Callar and The Sopranos \u2013 the latter being the inspiration for the play Our Ladies of Perpetual Succour. ==Life and career== ===Early life=== Warner's father was a Yorkshireman who served in World War Two. His parents were in their forties when he was born, and ran a coal delivery business in Mull, a shop in Kilchoan, and a small hotel in Oban, before in 1963 buying the 42-bedroom Marine Hotel, close to Oban ferry terminal.https://www.scotsman.com/whats-on/arts-and-entertainment/interview- alan-warner-author-deadmans-pedal-1624672 He attended Oban High School,http://www.alanwarner.net/ and his interest in reading was sparked when he was fifteen, after he bought three novels whose covers suggested stories with a sexual dimension: Charles Webb's The Graduate, Andr\u00e9 Gide's The Immoralist and Albert Camus' The Outsider. He explained in an interview with the Scottish Review of Books in 2011: \"I had presumed novels were an art form which only happened elsewhere and had died out in Scotland around the time of Walter Scott. What a very curious but genuine assumption. On the other hand, I could argue this was because local bookshops were stuffed with Scott and not a single work of modern Scottish literature.\" After moving to London, he studied at Ealing College. On his return to Scotland he studied at Glasgow University, where he wrote a dissertation on Joseph Conrad and the theme of suicide. He then spent some time participating in the Spanish rave scene, before working in Scotland as a train driver, musician, bouncer and barman.https://www.scottishreviewofbooks.org/2011/08/the-srb-interview-alan- warner-extended-version/ ===Novels and other fiction=== Warner's debut novel, the acclaimed Morvern Callar (1995), won a Somerset Maugham Award.
