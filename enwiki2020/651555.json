    "text": "African diaspora religions are a number of related religions that developed in the Americas in various nations of the Caribbean, Latin America, and the Southern United States. They derive from traditional African religions with some influence from other religious traditions, notably Christianity. ==Characteristics== Afro-American religions involve ancestor worship, and include a creator deity along with a pantheon of divine spirits such as the Orisha, Loa, Vodun, Nkisi, and Alusi, among others. In addition to the religious syncretism of these various African traditions, many also incorporate elements of Folk Catholicism including folk saints and other forms of Folk religion, Native American religion, Spiritism, Spiritualism, Shamanism (sometimes including the use of Entheogens) and European folklore. Various \"doctoring\" spiritual traditions also exist such as Obeah and Hoodoo which focus on spiritual health. African religious traditions in the Americas can vary. They can have non-prominent African roots or can be almost wholly African in nature, such as religions like Trinidad Orisha. == List of religions and spiritual traditions == === Brazil === * Batuque * Candombl\u00e9 ** Candombl\u00e9 Bantu ** Candombl\u00e9 Jej\u00e9 ** Candombl\u00e9 Ketu * Catimb\u00f3 * Macumba * Quimbanda * Santo Daime * Tambor de Mina * Umbanda * Xang\u00f4 de Recife (Yoruba religion, Brazil)Xango de Recife === Cuba === * Abaku\u00e1 * Arar\u00e1 religion * Cuban Vod\u00fa * Palo * Santer\u00eda === Cura\u00e7ao === * Montamentu === Dominican Republic === * Dominican Vud\u00fa === Guyana === * Comfa === Haiti === * Haitian Vodou === Jamaica === * Convince * Jamaican Maroon religion ** Kromanti dance * Kumina * Myal * Obeah * Rastafari ** Bobo Ashanti ** Nyabinghi ** Twelve Tribes of Israel === Puerto Rico === * Sans\u00e9 Espiritismo === Saint Lucia === * K\u00e9l\u00e9 === Suriname === * Winti === Trinidad and Tobago === * Spiritual Baptist * Trinidad Orisha === United States === * Hoodoo (Gullah Voodoo/Lowcountry Voodoo) * Louisiana Voodoo ==See also== * Black theology * Ring shout * Traditional African religion ==References== ==External links== * Roots and Rooted ",
