After his slight accident he remained in good condition. There were no bad thoughts in his mind about the incident until he overheard his mom speaking about her concern for Billy. She expressed her worries if he would become forgetful later in life because of the fall Billy suffered from. Billy begins to worry that he will have an issue in 2nd grade because of his fall and believes his mom's concerns will become reality. Billy begins to think he is not smart enough for 2nd grade, thinking he needs to do more than is expected to succeed. As the school year goes by, Billy learns to navigate 2nd grade at his best ability. Billy is later inspired by a classmate of his. Billy also starts to appreciate his family for who and what they are. Billy recognizes and appreciates the hard working mother and father he has and a sister he learns to treat with much more respect. Billy is surrounded by people who care very much about him, and though there are easy and there are hard times, everyone will always be there for him. ==Characters== *Billy Miller A typical 7 year old boy with unrealistic worries. *Mama Working mother, High school teacher who would do anything for her son Billy. *Papa Stay at home father.
