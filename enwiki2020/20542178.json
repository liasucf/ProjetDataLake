    "text": "The rufous-fronted bushtit or rufous-fronted tit (Aegithalos iouschistos) is a small passerine bird of the eastern and central Himalayas belonging to the long-tailed tit family, Aegithalidae. ==Taxonomy and systematics== The rufous- fronted bushtit forms a superspecies with the black-browed bushtit and white- throated bushtit. They have sometimes been regarded as a single species but are now usually treated as distinct. The ranges of the rufous-fronted and black-browed bushtits overlap slightly in China with no evidence of hybridization. ==Description== The rufous-fronted bushtit is 11 cm long. The adult has grey upperparts and reddish-brown underparts. The head is reddish- buff with a black mask and a silver bib with black streaks and a black edge. Juveniles are paler and duller than the adults. The black-browed bushtit is similar but has a white forehead and belly and a white edge to its bib. The white-throated bushtit has a white forehead and bib and a dark breastband. ==Distribution and habitat== The rufous-fronted bushtit is found in the eastern and central Himalayas in Bhutan, China, India and Nepal. It occurs in montane forests, both broad-leaved and coniferous, up to 3,600 m above sea- level. It typically feeds in flocks. ==References== * Grimmett, Richard, Carol Inskipp & Tim Inskipp (1999) Pocket Guide to the Birds of the Indian Subcontinent, Christopher Helm, London. * MacKinnon, John & Karen Phillipps (2000) A Field Guide to the Birds of China, Oxford University Press, Oxford. ==External links== *Oriental Bird Images: Rufous-fronted bushtit rufous- fronted bushtit Category:Birds of Bhutan Category:Birds of Northeast India Category:Birds of Nepal rufous-fronted bushtit rufous-fronted bushtit ",
