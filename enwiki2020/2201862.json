    "text": "The Council of Rome was a meeting of Catholic Church officials and theologians which took place in 382 under the authority of Pope Damasus I, the then current bishop of Rome. It was one of the fourth century councils that \"gave a complete list of the canonical books of both the Old Testament and the New Testament.\"The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church The previous year, the Emperor Theodosius I had appointed the \"dark horse\" candidate Nectarius as Archbishop of Constantinople. The bishops of the West opposed the election result and asked for a common synod of East and West to settle the succession of the see of Constantinople, and so the Emperor Theodosius, soon after the close of the First Council of Constantinople in 381, summoned the Imperial bishops to a fresh synod at Constantinople; nearly all of the same bishops who had attended the earlier second re assembled again in early summer of 382. On arrival they received a letter from the synod of Milan, inviting them to a great general council at Rome; they indicated that they must remain where they were, because they had not made any preparations for such long a journey; however, they sent three--Syriacus, Eusebius, and Priscian--with a joint synodal letter to Pope Damasus, Ambrose, archbishop of Milan, and the other bishops assembled in the council at Rome. == Decretum Gelasianum and damasine == The Decree of the Council of Rome (AD 382) on the Canon of Scripture during the reign of Pope Damasus I (AD 366\u2013384) reads thus: The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, states: Catholic apologist and historian William Jurgens writes: ==Notes== == Further reading == * Geoffrey Mark Hahneman, The Muratorian Fragment and the Development of the Canon, Oxford University Press, 1992 - pages 158\u2212161 ==External links== *The \"Damasine List\" Rome Rome Category:Ancient city of Rome Category:Development of the Christian biblical canon Category:4th century in Italy Category:380s in the Roman Empire Category:382 ",
