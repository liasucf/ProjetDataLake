    "text": "Abane Ramdane (June 10, 1920, Larba\u00e2 Nath Irathen \u2013 December 27, 1957) was an Algerian political activist and revolutionary born in Kabylie. He played a key role in the organization of the independence struggle during the Algerian war. His influence was so great that he was known as \"the architect of the revolution\". He was also the architect of the Soummam conference Bejaia in 1956 and was very close to Frantz Fanon. The National Liberation Front (FLN) had him killed, supposedly for creating a cult of the individual rather than the collective leadership. He was \"super-political\" and his murder was disturbing to many FLN members including President Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne who, according to the book, A Savage War of Peace, kept the assassins out of his future Algerian government. A few years after independence, he was reburied in his native village of Azouza in Tizi Ouzou Province. ==References== ==External links== *http://www.kabyle.com/article.php3?id_article=9353 Category:1920 births Category:1957 deaths Category:Algerian Berber politicians Category:Assassinated Algerian people Category:Kabyle people Category:Members of the National Liberation Front (Algeria) Category:Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Liberties politicians Category:People from Larba\u00e2 Nath Irathen ",
