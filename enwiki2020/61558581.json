He says he will reach out to Kushner and Flynn to find out who the \"key person or people\" are that Dmitriev should meet with.

Flynn later pleads guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Kislyak regarding the new sanctions. In December 2017, McFarland tells Mueller's team that Flynn said that Russia will not escalate in response to the sanctions because they want a good relationship with the new administration. ** Obama also amends Executive Order 13964 to authorize sanctions on individuals who interfere in U.S. elections.

Putin) \u2013 I always knew he was very smart!\" This action is widely interpreted as praising Putin's actions. ** Flynn texts a summary of his Kislyak call to McFarland, who forwards the information by email to Kushner, Bannon, Priebus, and other transition team members. The text and email deliberately omit the sanctions discussion because Flynn doesn't want it documented due to its political sensitivity. * December 31: Kislyak calls Flynn to tell him that Russia has decided not to retaliate based upon Flynn's request.

In addition to Trump, the other people present are incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, incoming CIA Director Mike Pompeo, incoming National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, and Vice President- elect Mike Pence.

In 2018 Nader tells Mueller's team that Prince led him to believe that Bannon was aware of the Dmitriev meeting, and, separately, Prince tells them it was fair for Nader to think he was representing the transition team, but Bannon tells them that Prince didn't inform him of the meeting in advance. * January 9: ** Cohen and Vekselberg meet at Trump Tower to discuss their mutual desire to improve Russia's relationship with the U.S. under the Trump administration.
