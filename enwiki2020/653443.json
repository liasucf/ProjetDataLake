In 2006 she published Daniel Stein, Interpreter (\u0414\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044d\u043b\u044c \u0428\u0442\u0430\u0439\u043d, \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0447\u0438\u043a), a novel dealing with the Holocaust and the need for reconciliation between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Ulitskaya herself belongs to a group of people formed by the realities of the former Soviet Union, who see themselves ethnically and culturally as Jews, while having adopted Christianity as their religion. Sasha Senderovich, Translations, book review in Tablet Magazine, 29 June 2011 ==Biography== Ulitskaya was born in the town of Davlekanovo in Bashkiria and grew up in Moscow where she received a degree in genetics from the Moscow State University. Having worked in the field of genetics and biochemistry, Ulitskaya began her literary career by joining the Jewish drama theatre as a literary consultant. Her first published short fiction appeared in 1990. Today, Lyudmila Ulitskaya divides her time between Moscow and Israel.Andrey Kurkov in: \"Das kann ein bisschen mehr Anarchie mitbringen\". Ukraine im Gespr\u00e4ch, part 4: Andrej Kurkow im Gespr\u00e4ch mit Katja Petrowskaja, Essay und Diskurs, Deutschlandfunk, 28 December 2014, German ==Fiction== ===Style=== In her fiction, Ulitskaya seemingly describes and observes her characters at an equal distance from each one. Rather than going in for character development or delving into the tortured workings of her characters\u2019 psyches otherwise perceived as the hallmark of Russian writing, Ulitskaya favors capsule descriptions, though she acknowledges that her characters are tortured. Generally speaking, she makes little use of dialogue. Masha Gessen, in her tribute article in The New Yorker in October 2014, finds that Ulitskaya's writing makes for compelling, addictive reading. Gessen reports that she was driven entirely by the desire to learn what happens next.Masha Gessen, The Weight of Words. One of Russia\u2019s most famous writers confronts the state, in: The New Yorker, 6 October 2014 ===Themes=== Among her interlinked themes are: the need for religious and ethnic tolerance; the problem of the intelligentsia in Soviet culture; how women shape new gender roles in society; and everyday life as a literary subject. ==Other activity== Lyudmila Ulitskaya on Bolotnaya Square in Moscow in February 2012 Ulitskaya authored two movie scripts produced in the early 1990s: The Liberty Sisters (\u0421\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u041b\u0438\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0438, 1990) and A Woman for All (\u0416\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445, 1991). She regularly publishes commentary on social issues and is actively involved in philanthropic projects increasing access to literature. In March 2014 Ulitskaya was among the key speakers at the Moscow Anti-War demonstration. ==Reception== Ulitskaya's first novella, Sonechka (\u0421\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043a\u0430), published in Novy Mir in 1992, almost immediately became extremely popular, and was shortlisted for the Russian Booker Award. Her works have been translated into several languages including English, and received several international and Russian literary awards, including the Russian Booker for The Kukotsky Enigma, Northwestern University Press catalog. (\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0443\u0441 \u041a\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0446\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e; 2001). Ulitskaya was the first woman to receive this distinguished prize. In Germany her novels have been added to bestseller lists thanks to the featuring of her works on a television program hosted by literary critic Elke Heidenreich. Today her writing is much admired by the general reading public and critics in Russia and many other countries. ==Awards== Lyudmila Ulitskaya as guest of honour at the 2009 16th International Book Festival, Millen\u00e1ris, Budapest * Penne Prize (1997, Italy) * Medici Prize (1998, France) * Giuseppe Acerbi Award :it:Premio Letterario Giuseppe Acerbi (1998, Italy) for her novel Sonechka * Russian Booker Prize (2002, Russia) for the novel The Kukotsky Enigma * Chevalier of the Ordre des Palmes Acad\u00e9miques (2003, France) * Novel of the Year Prize (2004, Russia) for the novel Sincerely yours, Shurik * Best Writer of the Year Ivanushka Prize (2004, Russia) * Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (2004, France) * National Literature Prize (2005, China) for Sincerely yours, Shurik * Penne Prize (2006, Italy) for the novel The Kukotsky Enigma * National Olympia Prize of Russian Academy of Business (2007, Russia) * National Literary Award Big Book (2007, Russia) for the novel Daniel Stein, Interpreter * Father Alexander Men Award (2008, Germany-Russia) * 2009 Man Booker International Prize nominee, along with 14 authors from 12 countries: Mario Vargas Llosa, E.L Doctorow and 2001 Nobel Prize winner V.
