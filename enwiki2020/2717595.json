    "text": "The Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann 8200 Class electrical multiple units were built for the Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART). The units were two-car sets, of which there were five. They were numbered in the sequence 820X+840X. 820X units are power cars while 840X units are unpowered driving trailers. ==History== The units first entered service in 2000. The units had operated in multiple with the 8500 and 8510 classes. The five members of this class spent long periods out of service, the most recent being from summer 2007 until March 2008. Following a brief return to service of all coaches with the exception of 8204/8404, all units were withdrawn from service yet again, with Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann citing frequent breakdowns and small seating as their reason for early withdrawal. They were stabled in Fairview DART depot during these periods of being out of service. In 2012 the units were tendered for sale, but were not sold. They remain decommissioned at Inchicore Works, clear of catenary. There was some suggestion of Irish rail looking at options to get a locomotive to haul them in 2015/6. == Fleet details == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Class !Operator !Number !Year Built !Cars per Set !Unit nos. !Withdrawn !Notes |- |8200 Class |DART |align=center|5 |align=center|1999-2000 |align=center|2 |8201/8401 \u2013 8205/8405 |align=center|2007-2008 |All stored at Inchicore Works |} ==See also== *Multiple Units of Ireland *Dublin Area Rapid Transit *IE 8500, 8510 and 8520 Classes ==External links== * Irish Rail Fleet Information webpage Category:Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann multiple units ",
