Stephen Curry and Viola Davis are executive producers; Mariska Hargitay is a co-producer. Emanuel first received critical acclaim at the 2018 Geena Davis\u2019 Bentonville Film Festival, where it won the Jury Prize for Best Documentary. The film also won the Heartland International Film Festival audience choice award. Emanuel\u2019s limited theatrical release opened June 17, 2019\u2014exactly four years after the shootings. == Synopsis == After 21-year-old white supremacist Dylann Roof opened fire during a prayer service in a Charleston, South Carolina church, nine African Americans were killed. Forty- eight hours later, the families of the Emanuel Nine stood in court facing the killer and offered words of forgiveness. Featuring interviews with survivors and family members, the documentary examines the history of race relations in Charleston, the significance and impact of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, and the effect on the community from the offered forgiveness. == Production == When director Brian Ivie first heard of the Charleston church shooting, he knew it was a story he wanted to tell. But he also wanted to give the families time to heal. A year later, he began filming the movie in Charleston, with interviews conducted at Emanuel AME Church and the homes of victims\u2019 families, among other locations. == Distribution == In January, 2020, the film made its television debut on Starz, in conjunction with the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. The film was later released free to the public for a two-week window beginning on June 2, 2020 to encourage education on racial injustice. == Themes == Justice, faith, peace and forgiveness are key themes throughout the documentary. == Impact == The producers of Emanuel are donating their profits from the film to the survivors of the shooting and the families of the victims. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2019 films Category:2019 documentary films Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:English-language films ",
