    "text": "The 2015\u201316 Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team represented Gonzaga University in the 2015\u201316 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team was led by head coach Mark Few, who was in his 17th season as head coach. The team played its home games at McCarthey Athletic Center, which had a capacity of 6,000. The Bulldogs (also informally referred to as the Zags) played in their 36th season as a member of the West Coast Conference. They finished the season 28\u20138, 15\u20133 in WCC play to finish in a share for the WCC regular season championship. They defeated Portland, BYU, and Saint Mary's to be champions of the WCC Tournament and earn the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. As a #11 seed, they defeated Seton Hall and Utah to advance to the Sweet Sixteen where they lost to Syracuse. ==Previous season== The 2014\u201315 Gonzaga Bulldogs team were predicted to finish atop of the conference by the West Coast Conference Preseason Poll. The Zags finished in first place in the West Coast Conference Standings for the 18th time with a 17\u20131 conference record after BYU defeated the Zags in the regular season finale, snapping the nation's longest active home winning streak of 41 games, as well as Gonzaga's school record 22-game winning streak. The Bulldogs then went on to beat BYU in the West Coast Conference Tournament, and claimed their 14th WCC tournament title, along with punching their 18th ticket to the NCAA Tournament. Gonzaga entered the 2015 NCAA Tournament as a #2 seed in the South region, and dismantled #15 seed North Dakota State, #7 seed Iowa, and #11 seed UCLA, to gain its second trip to the Elite Eight, as well as Mark Few's first as head coach. The Zags then fell to #1 seed (and eventual national champion) Duke, and finished the season with a 35\u20133 record, which were the most wins in school history. ==Offseason== ===Coaching Changes=== ====Additions to Staff==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\" border=\"1\" !

He was granted a medical hardship waiver and will have 4 years of eligibility remaining effective at the start of the 2015\u201316 season. * Jesse Wade graduated high school in 2015, but before enrolling in college at Gonzaga, he left for a 2-year LDS mission in Lyon, France, and will arrive on campus as a freshman in Fall 2017. * Przemek Karnowski did not play after the Bulldogs' fifth game of the season, a November 27, 2015 win over UConn, due to back problems. On December 31, it was announced that he would undergo surgery and miss the rest of the season. At the time his surgery was announced, it had not been decided whether Karnowski would apply for a medical hardship waiver and play at Gonzaga in 2016\u201317, or turn professional after this season. He ultimately chose to remain at Gonzaga and play in the 2016\u201317 season. ===Depth chart=== ===Coaching staff=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\" border=\"1\" |- !Name !!Position !!Year at Gonzaga !!Alma Mater (year) |- |Mark Few|| Head Coach || 17th || Oregon (1987) |- |Tommy Lloyd || Associate Head Coach || 15th || Whitman (1998) |- |Donny Daniels || Assistant Coach || 6th || Cal State Fullerton (1976) |- |Brian Michaelson ||Assistant Coach || 3rd || Gonzaga (2005) |- |Doug Wojcik ||Special Assistant to the Head Coach || 1st || Navy (1987) |- |John Jakus || Director of Basketball Operations || 2nd || Trinity International (1999) |- |Mike Hart || Video Coordinator || 2nd || Gonzaga (2012) |- | Riccardo Fois || Director of Analytics || 2nd || Pepperdine (2009) |- |Jennifer Nyland || Athletic Trainer || 17th || Washington State (1998) |- |Travis Knight || Strength & Conditioning Coach || 10th ||Gonzaga (2000) |} ==Rankings== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;text- align:center;\" |+ Ranking movement Legend: \u2588\u2588 Increase in ranking. \u2588\u2588 Decrease in ranking.
