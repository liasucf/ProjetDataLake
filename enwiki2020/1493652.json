It is the international feed of the National Television of Chile. ==History== The first national satellite broadcasts of TVN began in 1986, reaching also some parts of Latin America. TV Chile, as an independent signal from TVN, began officially in 1989.http://www.tvn.cl/corporativo/identificacionbasica/ Things would change radically for the network during the 2000s, when it made a contract with DirecTV, which allowed TV Chile to reach over 140 countries worldwide, which roughly constitutes 66 percent of the world's countries. The channel's current programming consists basically of variety and music shows, as well as programs dedicated to tourism, comedy and news. In the year 2000, TV Chile was able to reach Australia for the first time after signing a television contract with TARBS. The service has been intermittently operating, as once TARBS shut down operations in 2004, UBI World TV began carrying it. The channel is currently being distributed in the region via Luso Vision. ==References== ==External links== * Official site Category:Televisi\u00f3n Nacional de Chile Category:Television stations in Chile Category:International broadcasters Category:Spanish-language television stations Category:Television channels and stations established in 1989 Category:Companies based in Santiago Category:1989 establishments in Chile ",
