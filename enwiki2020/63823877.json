The gum was depleted by 1919, and suggestions were made to use the land for settlement of returning soldiers from World War I, or planting trees on it. The land was covered with a noxious weed, hakea. An experimental farm was established in the late 1920s. This was not promising at first, but by the mid 1940s the experiment was much more successful. Kapiro became a rich dairying area. A vineyard was established from 2007. ==References== Category:Far North District Category:Populated places in the Northland Region ",
