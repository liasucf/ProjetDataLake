    "text": "Italienzug (also known as Romfahrt or Romzug, Latin expeditio italica) was king of the Roman's march to Rome, where he would be crowned the Holy Roman emperor. Prior to the reforms of Frederick Barbarossa, the kings of the Romans struggled to muster an army for the expedition, for they need the formal approval of the Reichstag. If such permission was granted, the king had permission to recruit knights for their military service in Italy for 410 days. However, the nobility was generally disinterested and would rather substitute the service with a monetary payment. Therefore, the small force tended to be composed out of mercenaries and high ranking clergymen, reinforced by loyal Italian cities. Occasionally the substitution wasn't enough and kings like Henry V ended up using their dowry to fund their Italienzug. Following Barbarossa's struggles against the Lombard League towards the end of the 12th century, the system was reformed by banning monetary substitution and requiring each prince to contribute a fixed amount of troops for the cause. ==References== Category:History of the Holy Roman Empire Category:Medieval Italy Category:History of Rome ",
