    "text": "Lis\u00edstrata is a 2002 Spanish comedy film directed by Francesc Bellmunt. It is based on a comic book by the German cartoonist Ralf K\u00f6nig, which in turn is loosely based on the play Lysistrata by Aristophanes. ==Plot== It is the year 411 BC and the Peloponnesian War between Sparta (among others) and Athens has been raging for some 20 years. The women who want to see the conflict finally ended use a trick to make their husbands comply: led by the Feminist Lis\u00edstrata (Maribel Verd\u00fa), they barricade themselves on the Acropolis, where the Athenian treasure is kept, and refuse to have sex with their husbands until peace is restored. The men soon sport gigantic erections, which as in Aristophanes' play are depicted by huge prosthetics that protrude from under the actors' clothes. This unfortunate state of \"blue balls\" hinders them in their capacity to fight. Luckily, the Spartans have the same problem. To the rescue comes Hepatitos (Juan Luis Galiardo), the local homosexual and transvestite, who disguises himself as a medical doctor and advises the generals to order circumstantial homosexuality as a way to relieve the pressure in their men. At first, the soldiers refuse, but quickly warm up to the idea -- and soon everyone lives rather happily in male-male relationships. The women are not amused by this, as their plan has been foiled. However, as the soldiers begin to fall in love with enemy soldiers instead of fighting them, peace is finally established. The women end their strike (not to the delight of all men) and it is hinted that in the future, homosexual and heterosexual relationships will be regarded as relatively exchangeable. While the film is primarily a bawdy comedy (even more so than the Greek play), it also contains interesting tidbits of historic truth, such as a relatively accurate life-size replica of the Pallas Athene statue by Phidias in the Parthenon. The scene in which one soldier is about to kill an enemy fighter, but is moved by his beauty so much that he spares him and arranges a t\u00eate-\u00e0- t\u00eate with him after the battle, can be seen as being based on the legend of Achilles and Troilus, son of Priam. ==Cast== * Maribel Verd\u00fa as Lis\u00edstrata * Juan Luis Galiardo as Hepatitos * Javier Gurruchaga as Ajax * Jes\u00fas Bonilla as Cinesias * Tet\u00e9 Delgado (billed as Tete Delgado) as Mirrina * Aitor Mazo as General Termos * Gl\u00f2ria Cano as Sabrina * Eduardo Antu\u00f1a as Harpix * Antonio Belart as Potax * Cristina Sol\u00e0 as Lampito * Anna Maria Barbany (billed as Anna M\u00aa Barbany) as Papila * Albert Trifol as General Bonus * Sonia Ferrer (billed as S\u00f2nia Ferrer) as Cleonice * Sergio Pazos as Oficial Bit\u00f3n * Jos\u00e9 Corbacho as Soldado Lico ==See also== * List of films based on military books (pre-1775) ==External links== * Category:2002 films Category:2002 comedy films Category:Films based on works by Aristophanes Category:Films based on adaptations Category:Spanish LGBT-related films Category:Spanish films Category:Catalan-language films Category:Spanish-language films Category:Films based on German comics Category:Live-action films based on comics Category:Spanish comedy films Category:Works based on Lysistrata ",
