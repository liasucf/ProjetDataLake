In 1564 Pergo\u0161i\u0107 was a rector of a school in Zagreb. He was one of four most important members of the Vara\u017edin literary circle, besides Antun Vramec, Bla\u017e \u0160krinjari\u0107 and Bla\u017e Antilovi\u0107. Pergo\u0161i\u0107 was tolerant to Protestantism. == Decretum == Pergo\u0161i\u0107 published his works in Zagreb and Vara\u017edin. In 1574 he printed a translation of \u201cTripartitum\u201d written by Istv\u00e1n Werb\u0151czy. Pergo\u0161i\u0107 referred to the language he used in this translation (titled Decretum) was Slavic (Szlouienski in original, ) and in its preface Pergo\u0161i\u0107 emphasized that it was written for \"Slavs and Croats\". It is assumed that he used terms Slavs and Croats to refer to the people of two administrative regions of Habsburg Monarchy (Kingdom of Slavonia and Kingdom of Croatia) without any sort of ethnic connotation. Pergo\u0161i\u0107's 1574 translation of \u201cTripartitum\u201d is considered the first printed book on Kajkavian dialect and the first printed work of Kajkavian literature. == References == == Sources == * * * * * * * Category:1521 births Category:1592 deaths Category:History of the Serbo-Croatian language ",
