    "text": "Tang Dynasty () is a Chinese rock band formed in 1989. They are often credited as being the first Chinese heavy metal band. ==Biography== Singer and rhythm guitarist Ding Wu, bassist Zhang Ju, and Chinese-American guitarist Kaiser Kuo co-founded Tang Dynasty in early 1989. Kaiser left shortly after to return to the United States. Liu \"Lao Wu\" Yijun took his place and, according to Kaiser, went on to become China's first \"guitar hero.\" In 1991, the band released its metal/rock version of \"The Internationale\" in Chinese. Tang Dynasty rose to fame with their eponymous debut album, released in December 1992. The album officially sold about 2,000,000 authentic copies throughout Asia and abroad, not counting the multitudes more of infringing copies. Their sound is part progressive rock and artistic metal and part traditional Chinese vocal technique. The lyrical poetry and musical arrangements meant to hearken back to the glorious days of ancient Chinese civilization; in particular, the art and cultural epitome of Chinese history as popularly represented by the era of the Tang dynasty. Bassist Zhang Ju died on May 11, 1995, when his motorcycle collided with a truck on the Zizhuqiao freeway overpass in western Beijing. Gu Zhong became bass player, but in August Liu left the band. Co-founder Kaiser Kuo rejoined as guitarist in August 1996. The band's 1998 release Epic was their second album, seven years after their debut record. Kaiser again parted company with Tang Dynasty in June 1999 and later formed another well- recognized metal/rock band, Spring and Autumn (Chunqiu).Kaiser Kuo: Biography Kaiser was replaced by former Iron Kite frontman Yu Yang, and then by young guitar virtuoso Chen Lei in late 2000. After some more member changes, Liu rejoined the group in 2002.
