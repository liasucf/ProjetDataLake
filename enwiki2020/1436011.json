    "text": "The tzimtzum or tsimtsum (Hebrew ' \"contraction/constriction/condensation\") is a term used in the Lurianic Kabbalah to explain Isaac Luria's doctrine that God began the process of creation by \"contracting\" his Ohr Ein Sof (infinite light) in order to allow for a \"conceptual space\" in which finite and seemingly independent realms could exist. This primordial initial contraction, forming a \u1e25\u0101l\u0101l happ\u0101nuy \"vacant space\" () into which new creative light could beam, is denoted by general reference to the tzimtzum. In contrast to earlier, Medieval Kabbalah, this made the first creative act a concealment/Divine exile rather than unfolding revelation. This dynamic crisis-catharsis in the Divine flow is repeated throughout the Lurianic scheme. Because the tzimtzum results in the \"empty space\" in which spiritual and physical Worlds and ultimately, free will can exist, God is often referred to as \"Ha-Makom\" ( lit. \"the Place\", \"the Omnipresent\") in Rabbinic literature (\"He is the Place of the World, but the World is not His Place\"Parshat Vayeitzei: Yalkut Shimoni on the verse \"He arrived...\" Also, alternate sages in Midrash Bereishit Rabbah 68:9. HaMakom article, inner.org). In Kabbalistic interpretation, this describes the paradox of simultaneous Divine presence and absence within the vacuum and resultant Creation. Relatedly, Olam \u2014 the Hebrew for \"World/Realm\" \u2014 is derived from the root \u05e2\u05dc\u05dd meaning \"concealment\". This etymology is complementary with the concept of Tzimtzum in that the subsequent spiritual realms and the ultimate physical universe conceal to different degrees the infinite spiritual lifeforce of creation. Their progressive diminutions of the Divine Ohr (Light) from realm to realm in creation are also referred to in the plural as secondary tzimtzumim (innumerable \"condensations/veilings/constrictions\" of the lifeforce). However, these subsequent concealments are found in earlier, Medieval Kabbalah. The new doctrine of Luria advanced the notion of the primordial withdrawal (a dilug - radical \"leap\") in order to reconcile a causal creative chain from the Infinite with finite Existence. ==Lurianic thought== Isaac Luria introduced four central themes into kabbalistic thought, tzimtzum, Shevirat HaKelim (the shattering of the vessels), Tikkun (repair), and Partzufim. These four are a group of interrelated, and continuing, processes. Tzimtzum describes the first step in the process by which God began the process of creation by withdrawing his own essence from an area, creating an area in which creation could begin. Shevirat HaKelim describes how, after the tzimtzum, God created the vessels (HaKelim) in the empty space, and how when God began to pour his Light into the vessels they were not strong enough to hold the power of God's Light and shattered (Shevirat). The third step, Tikkun, is the process of gathering together, and raising, the sparks of God's Light that were carried down with the shards of the shattered vessels.James David Dunn, Windows of the Soul, p.21-24 Since tzimtzum is connected to the concept of exile, and Tikkun is connected to the need to repair the problems of the world of human existence, Luria unites the cosmology of Kabbalah with the practice of Jewish ethics, and makes ethics and traditional Jewish religious observance the means by which God allows humans to complete and perfect the material world through living the precepts of a traditional Jewish life.J.H. Laenen, Jewish Mysticism, p.168-169 ==Chabad view== In Chabad Hassidism the concept of tzimtzum is understood as not meant to be interpreted literally, but rather to refer to the manner in which God impresses his presence upon the consciousness of finite reality: thus tzimtzum is not only seen as being a real process but is also seen as a doctrine that every person is able, and indeed required, to understand and meditate upon. In the Chabad view, the function of the tzimtzum was \"to conceal from created beings the activating force within them, enabling them to exist as tangible entities, instead of being utterly nullified within their source\".Tanya, Shaar Hayichud veHaEmunah, ch.4 The tzimtzum produced the required \"vacated space\" (chalal panui , chalal ), devoid of direct awareness of God's presence. ==Vilna Gaon's view== The Vilna Gaon held that tzimtzum was not literal, however, the \"upper unity\", the fact that the universe is only illusory, and that tzimtzum was only figurative, was not perceptible, or even really understandable, to those not fully initiated in the mysteries of Kabbalah.E. J. Schochet, The Hasidic Movement and the Gaon of Vilna Others say that Vilna Gaon held the literal view of the tzimzum.Allan Nadler, The Faith of the Mithnagdim Shlomo Elyashiv articulates this view clearly (and claims that not only is it the opinion of the Vilna Gaon, but also is the straightforward and simple reading of Luria and is the only true understanding). He writes: However, the Gaon and Elyashiv held that tzimtzum only took place in God's will (Ratzon), but that it is impossible to say anything at all about God himself (Atzmus). Thus, they did not actually believe in a literal tzimtzum in God's essence. Luria's Etz Chaim itself, however, in the First Shaar, is ambivalent: in one place it speaks of a literal tzimtzum in God's essence and self, then it changes a few lines later to a tzimtzum in the Divine Light (an emanated, hence created and not part of God's self, energy). ==Inherent paradox== A commonly heldsee for example Aryeh Kaplan, \"Paradoxes\" (in \"The Aryeh Kaplan Reader\", Artscroll 1983. ) understanding in Kabbalah is that the concept of tzimtzum contains a built-in paradox, requiring that God be simultaneously transcendent and immanent. On the one hand, if the \"Infinite\" did not restrict itself, then nothing could exist\u2014everything would be overwhelmed by God's totality. Existence thus requires God's transcendence, as above. On the other hand, God continuously maintains the existence of, and is thus not absent from, the created universe. Rabbi Nachman of Breslav discusses this inherent paradox as follows: ==Application in clinical psychology== An Israeli professor, Mordechai Rotenberg, believes the Kabbalistic-Hasidic tzimtzum paradigm has significant implications for clinical therapy. According to this paradigm, God's \"self- contraction\" to vacate space for the world serves as a model for human behavior and interaction. The tzimtzum model promotes a unique community- centric approach which contrasts starkly with the language of Western psychology. ==In popular culture== Tsimtsum is central to the plot of Aryeh Lev Stollman's 1997 novel The Far Euphrates. \"Tsim Tsum\" is the title of a collection of vignettes by Sabrina Orah Mark (published 2009). In Yann Martel's novel Life of Pi and its 2012 film adaptation, a cargo ship called the Tsimtsum sinks at a pivotal point of the plot, despite the name being entirely irrelevant to the Judaic concept of tzimtzum. ==See also== * Acosmism * Apeiron (cosmology) * Big Bounce * Monism * Nondualism ==Notes== ==References== * Jacob Immanuel Schochet, Mystical Concepts in Chassidism, especially chapter II, Kehot 1979,3rd revised edition 1988. * Aryeh Kaplan, \"Paradoxes\", in \"The Aryeh Kaplan Reader\", Artscroll 1983. * Aryeh Kaplan, \"Innerspace\", Moznaim Pub.
