Its other boundaries are the same as those of the parish. The ward contains Shuttleworth College, Padiham Primary School and a Nursery. Also Padiham Town Hall, Police Station and Fire Station, as well as the retail district and Market. As previously mentioned the River Calder passes through the ward, as does the A671. The ward is almost entirely urban in nature, with a single farm in its north-west corner. In 2001, 75.8% of dwellings where in the lowest Council Tax band. ==Demography== The United Kingdom Census 2001 showed a total resident population for this ward of 6,119 of which 2,918 are male and 3,201 female, with a mean age of 37.92 Years.
