    "text": "Fast Racing League (stylized as FAST Racing League) is a racing game developed and published by Shin'en Multimedia and released for Wii as a WiiWare title on 27 May 2011. It has spawned two sequels, Fast Racing Neo and Fast RMX. == Gameplay == Fast Racing League is a fast-paced, futuristic racing game similar to F-Zero and Wipeout. However, unlike other racing games, it features a \"phase shift mechanic\" which allows the player to switch their vehicle between light and dark phases. These can be used to take advantage of colored pads on the track to boost the player's speed or launch the vehicle into the air, which only work if the vehicle is the same color. The player must collect energy orbs scattered across the track to fill their energy meter, which allows them to switch phases, adding extra challenge to the game. ==References== ==External links== * Game page on Shin'en Multimedia website Category:2011 video games Category:Futuristic racing games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Germany Category:WiiWare games Category:Wii-only games Category:Wii games ",
