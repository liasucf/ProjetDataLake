He was in Scotland in the King's service in June 1291. In April 1294 he had a writ of protection from the King when he travelled overseas with the King's daughter, Eleanor of Bar. He served in Gascony in 1295 and 1296, and was present at the action around Bordeaux on 28 March 1296, when his standard bearer was captured by the French. In 1297 he was summoned for service in the Franco-Flemish War, and attended Councils in Rochester and London in that year. ===War against the Scots=== He was summoned for service against the Scots in 1297-1313. He fought in the Vanguard at the Battle of Falkirk on 22 July 1298. King Edward's army at that battle consisted of 12,000 infantry, including 10,000 Welsh, and 2,000 cavalry. William Wallace, the Scottish leader accepted battle in a withdrawn defensive position. Wallace had few cavalry and few archers; but his solid \"schiltrons\" (circles) of spearmen were almost invincible. The armoured cavalry of the English vanguard were hurled back with severe losses. Edward brought up his Welsh archers in the intervals between the horsemen of the second line, concentrating their arrows on specific points in the Scottish schiltrons. It was into these gaps that the English knights forced their way, and once the Scottish order was broken the spearmen were quickly massacred. ===Siege of Caerlaverock=== Alan was at the siege of Caerlaverock Castle in July 1300. His presence is recorded in the contemporary \"Caerlaverock Poem\", being an early roll of arms: :Aleyn de la Souche tresor Signiioit ke fust brians Sa rouge baniere a besans Car bienscai ki a dependu Tresor plus ke en burce pendu \"Sa rouge baniere a bezants\" (as re-stated in modern French) \"his red banner bezant\u00e9e\", is the description of the coat of arms he bore at the siege. ==Subsequent career== He was summoned to Edward II's coronation on 18 January 1307/08. In December of that year he had a protection to go on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. He was the Constable of Rockingham Castle and the Keeper of the forests between the bridges of Oxford and Stamford. ==Marriage and issue== He married Eleanor de Segrave, daughter of Nicholas de Segrave, 1st Baron Segrave. At his death he left no male progeny and the barony went into abeyance between his three daughters and co-heiresses: *Ellen la Zouche, married Alan de Charlton; also married Nicholas de St Maur, 1st Baron St Maur (d.1316)Burke, John, A General and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerages of England, Ireland, and Scotland Extinct, Dormant and in Abeyance, London, 1831, pp.461-2, Baron St Maur *Maud la Zouche, married Robert de Holland, 1st Baron Holand; she was the mother of Thomas Holland, who married Joan of Kent. *Elizabeth la Zouche, married John Ingham (1320-12 Dec. 1365), son of Oliver de Ingham (1294\u20131344). ==References== Category:1267 births Category:1314 deaths Category:Barons in the Peerage of England ",
