    "text": "President Donald Trump formally announced Operation Warp Speed on May 15, 2020 in the White House Rose Garden. Operation Warp Speed is a public\u2013private partnership, initiated by the Trump administration, to facilitate and accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. Operation Warp Speed was introduced in early April 2020, after a round-table meeting with Trump, Pence and industry executives at the White House on March 2. It will promote mass production of multiple vaccines based on preliminary evidence allowing for faster distribution if clinical trials confirm one of the vaccines is safe and effective. The plan anticipates that some of these vaccines will not prove safe or effective, making the program more costly than typical vaccine development, but potentially leading to the availability of a viable vaccine several months earlier than typical timelines. Congress allocated on March 27 nearly $10 billion for Operation Warp Speed through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, with $6.5 billion designated by Congress for countermeasure development through BARDA, along with $3 billion for NIH research. Operation Warp Speed is an interagency program that includes components of the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority; the Department of Defense; private firms; and other federal agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. ==History== After it was first revealed in the press on 29 April, President Trump officially announced the public-private partnership on May 15, 2020. Operation Warp Speed will coordinate existing Health and Human Services-wide efforts, including the NIH ACTIV partnership for vaccine and therapeutic development, the NIH RADx initiative for diagnostic development, and work by BARDA. The Food and Drug Administration announced on June 30, 2020 that the vaccine will need to be at least 50% effective to gain approval, in at least diminishing the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. ==Leadership and budget== After Rick Bright, the BARDA Director was reassigned on or about April 22 following his resistance of \"efforts to fund potentially dangerous drugs promoted by those with political connections,\" Moncef Slaoui was named in May by the Trump administration as Operation Warp Speed chief adviser. Slaoui is a vaccine researcher and, formerly, Chairman of Global Research and Development and Chairman of Global Vaccines at GlaxoSmithKline, where he led the development of five major novel vaccines. General Gustave F. Perna, who served as commanding general of Army Materiel Command, was named Operation Warp Speed chief operating officer. The project has other scientists, physicians, and military officers involved in management of the key focus areas of development, manufacturing, and distribution. The project has a budget of $10 billion, with additional funds allocated through BARDA. ==Engaged in OWS== As of August, eight companies were chosen for funding of some $11 billion to expedite development and preparation for manufacturing their respective vaccine candidates. In June, agreements of $1.2 billion for successful vaccine were signed with AstraZeneca and $483 million with Moderna. In July, Operation Warp Speed agreed to pay $1.6 billion to Novavax if clinical trials are successful to produce 100 million doses of its candidate vaccine. Novavax is a company with no history of marketed products. Also in July, Pfizer and BioNTech received an order of $2 billion to manufacture 100 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine when it is shown to be safe and effective, and is licensed. On July 31, Sanofi and GSK were funded for $2.1 billion. The vaccine developers engaged in the operation are: * Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceutical) * AstraZeneca\u2013University of Oxford and Vaccitech * Pfizer-BioNTech * Moderna * Merck and IAVI * Novavax * Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline Indirectly funded companies include: * Vaxart (in collaboration with Emergent BioSolutions) * Inovio Operation Warp Speed also funds potential drugs for treatment and prevention, although to a lesser degree. As of early October 2020, Warp Speed had \"spent less than $1 billion to support the development and manufacturing of three monoclonal antibody treatments, versus almost $10 billion on six vaccines.\" * Regeneron was to receive $450 million to develop and supply a monoclonal antibody drug, as the government announced on July 7, 2020. ==Criticism== ===Timeline=== The goals of the project to develop, manufacture, and distribute hundreds of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses by the end of 2020 have been criticized as being unrealistic, based on decades of experience in developing viral infection vaccines which normally require years or decades for assuring the chosen vaccine will not be toxic and has adequate efficacy. Most viral infections do not have vaccines because the vaccine technology has failed in early-stage clinical trials. Because many vaccines cause side effects, such as pain at the injection site, headaches, and influenza symptoms, safety testing requires years of observation in thousands of clinical trial participants. Similarly, sufficient time - a year or usually many years - is needed to be certain a vaccine has durable efficacy while the virus remains pandemic. For these reasons, despite extensive previous research attempts to produce safe, effective vaccines against coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, all vaccine candidates for coronavirus infections have failed during clinical research, and no vaccine exists to prevent any coronavirus infection. To prepare for manufacturing and distribution, Operation Warp Speed will expend resources and financing before the safety and efficacy results of vaccine candidates are known, possibly wasting vaccine doses and their costs. ===Competition=== There is potential that the Warp Speed project will expend effort and funding in direct competition with publicly-traded American vaccine companies already fully engaged and financed for development. There is also the possibility that a billion dollars or more of U.S. taxpayer money will be expended on only American efforts or a narrow alternate choice, such as investing in one other vaccine platform - the University of Oxford-AstraZeneca candidate for which the U.S. already paid billion in May 2020 to receive 300 million doses for American use, if the AstraZeneca vaccine is successful in advancing to proof of safety and efficacy beyond its status as an early-stage Phase I\u2013II trial in May. Warp Speed will not partner with Chinese vaccine development organizations, or with the World Health Organization (WHO), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, or the European Commission, which are coordinating and financing international programs for multiple vaccine development, having raised $8 billion together from international partners on May 4 for a Coronavirus Global Response. The U.S. government chose not to include Operation Warp Speed as part of the international Solidarity trial on vaccine development, organized by the WHO. ===Vaccine hesitancy=== There is concern that the name and intended shortened timeline of Operation Warp Speed could encourage the antivaccine movement, with one expert stating: \"I don\u2019t see a path by which you can collect enough efficacy and safety data by the end of the year.\" Failure of the public to have confidence in a new vaccine and refuse vaccination is a global health concern called vaccine hesitancy, which increases the risk of further viral spreading that could lead to ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks during 2020\u201321. A September 2020 survey found that half of American adults surveyed said they would not accept a vaccination if it was available at that time, and three-quarters expressed concerns about the pace of the process and fears that a vaccine might be confirmed before its safety and effectiveness are fully understood. ===Leader neutrality=== The leader of the Operation Warp Speed project, Moncef Slaoui, had been a board member of the U.S. vaccine developer, Moderna, and divested his shares in Moderna stock, at a potential personal gain of $10 million, raising questions of his neutrality in judging vaccine candidates. Although Slaoui resigned from the Moderna board when named to head Warp Speed, his share value in Moderna stock increased by $3 million in one day when Moderna announced an advance in vaccine clinical research. ===Exaggerated claims made by some involved companies=== Shareholders have sued Inovio claiming the company exaggerated evidence for its coronavirus vaccine's efficacy in order to boost its stock price. A class action lawsuit has been filed against Vaxart in Northern California U.S. District Court for alleged securities fraud,Himmelberg v. Vaxart, Inc., No. 20-cv-05949 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 24, 2020) a concern also reported in the press. ==References== Category:COVID-19 pandemic in the United States Category:Federal government of the United States Category:Non-combat military operations involving the United States Category:Presidency of Donald Trump Category:United States Department of Health and Human Services ",
