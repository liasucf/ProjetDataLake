    "text": "\"Adoro te devote\" is a Eucharistic hymn written by Thomas Aquinas.Christopher Howse, 'Not a hymn but a personal poem,'. The Telegraph. 17 Jan 2015. retrieved 5 Nov 2015. Adoro te devote is one of the five Eucharistic hymns, which were composed and set to music for the Solemnity of Corpus Christi, instituted in 1264 by Pope Urban IV as a Solemnity for the entire Roman Catholic Church. Since the beginning of its composition and it being set to music, Adoro te devote was chanted as an Eucharistic Hymn during the Saint Mass in honorem SS. Sacramenti (in honour of the Most Blessed Sacrament), as it was written in the Latin manuscripts. So it was also chanted for the Eucharistic adoration. The authorship of the hymn by Aquinas was previously doubted by some scholars. More recent scholarship has put such doubts to rest. Aquinas seems to have used it also as a private prayer, for a daily adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. Adoro te devote is one of the medieval poetic compositions, being used as spoken prayers and also as chanted hymns, which were preserved in the Roman Missal published in 1570 following the Council of Trent (1545\u20131563). The hymn is still sung today, though its use is optional in the post-Vatican II ordinary form. ==Text and literal translation== {| class=wikitable !Latin text !literal English translation |- |- |valign=top| : Adoro te devote, latens deitas, : Qu\u00e6 sub his figuris vere latitas; : Tibi se cor meum totum subjicit, : Quia te contemplans totum deficit. : Visus, tactus, gustus in te fallitur, : Sed auditu solo tuto creditur. : Credo quidquid dixit Dei Filius; : Nil hoc verbo Verit\u00e1tis, at the points: 1:10, 2:00, 3:46 minutes verius. : In Cruce latebat sola Deitas, : At hic latet simul et Humanitas, : Ambo tamen credens atque confitens, : Peto quod petivit latro p\u0153nitens. : Plagas, sicut Thomas, non intueor: : Deum tamen meum te confiteor. : Fac me tibi semper magis credere, : In te spem habere, te diligere. : O memoriale mortis Domini, : Panis vivus, vitam pr\u00e6stans homini, : Pr\u00e6sta me\u00e6 menti de te v\u00edvere, : Et te illi semper dulce sapere. : Pie Pelicane, Jesu Domine, : Me immundum munda tuo Sanguine: : Cujus una stilla salvum facere : Totum mundum quit ab omni scelere. : Jesu, quem velatum nunc aspicio, : Oro, fiat illud quod tam sitio: : Ut te revelata cernens facie, : Visu sim be\u00e1tus tu\u00e6 glori\u00e6. Amen. |valign=top| : I devoutly adore you, hidden deity, : Who are truly hidden beneath these appearances. : My whole heart submits to You, : And in contemplating You, it surrenders itself completely. : Sight, touch, taste are all deceived in their judgment of you, : But hearing suffices firmly to believe. : I believe all that the Son of God has spoken; : There is nothing truer than this word of Truth. : On the cross only the divinity was hidden, : But here the humanity is also hidden. : Yet believing and confessing both, : I ask for what the penitent thief asked. : I do not see wounds as Thomas did, : But I confess that You are my God. : Make me believe much more in You, : Hope in you, and love You. : O memorial of our Lord's death, : Living Bread that gives life to man, : Grant my soul to live on You, : And always to savor your sweetness. : Lord Jesus, Good Pelican, : wash my filthiness and clean me with Your Blood, : One drop of which can free : the entire world of all its sins. : Jesus, whom now I see hidden, : I ask You to fulfill what I so desire: : That the sight of Your Face being unveiled : I may have the happiness of seeing Your glory. Amen. |} There are two variant readings of the Latin text, with slightly different nuances to some of the words: \"most of the variations occur in the first two verses. The substitution of the words \"posset omni sc\u00e9lere\" in place of \"quit ab omni sc\u00e9lere\" in the second-to-last verse and \"cupio\" for \"sitio\" in the closing one are practically the only other changes\". This does not affect the overall meaning of the lines or stanzas so that \"either variant may be legitimately used according to local custom.\" ==Poetic English translations== There have been at least 16 significant English translations of Adoro te devote, reflecting its popularity as a prayer and hymn,Catholic Encyclopedia 1917, Adoro te devote. retrieved 5 Nov 2015 including versions by Edward Bouverie Pusey, Edward Caswall, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. One translated version is the popular hymn \"Humbly We Adore Thee\". The melody is Benedictine plainsong from the 13th century.\"Adoro Te Devote\", Hymnary == Liturgical use == This hymn was added to the Roman Missal in 1570 by Pope Pius V, and also it has more quotations in the Catechism of the Catholic Church (n. 1381). This Eucharistic hymn was generally chanted with a genuflection in front of the Blessed Sacrament. The hymn is typically used as an Eucharistic hymn and is sung either during the distribution of communion at Mass, or during the Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. == Final prayer == Until the first half of the nineteenth century, the (Eucharistic) chant Adoro te devote was often used to be followed by this second Thanksgiving prayer, referred to Jesus Christ God: :Obsecro Te, sancte Domine Jesu :Christe, ut passio tua sit mihi virtus :qua muniar atque defendar, :vulnera tua sit mihi cibus potusque :quibus pascar, inebrier atque delecter; :aspersio sanguinis tui sit mihi ablutio :omnium delictorum meorum; :resurrectio tua sit mihi gloria :sempiterna. In his sit mihi refectio, :exultatio sanitas et dulcedo :cordis mei. Qui vivis et regnas in :unitate Patri et Spiritus Sancti Deus :per omnia saecula saeculorum. :Amen. The 13 December 1849, Pope Pius IX stated a period of some days of indulgence in favour of any Christian people having declaimed this prayer.Giuseppe Riva, Manuale di Filotea, Milano, 1860, pag. 213 ==See also== * Veni Creator Spiritus * Lauda Sion * Pange Lingua * Sacris solemniis * Verbum supernum prodiens ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== * * \"Humbly We Adore Thee Category:Latin-language Christian hymns Category:Eucharist in the Catholic Church Category:13th-century poems Category:13th-century hymns Category:13th-century Latin literature Category:Medieval literature Category:Works by Thomas Aquinas Category:Thomas Aquinas Category:Italian Christian hymns ",
