She married Duke Francis of Brunswick-Gifhorn (1508\u20131549) on 29 September 1547 in the Saxe-Lauenburgian castle at Neuhaus in Darzing. The couple were greatly loved by their subjects even if their short marriage of convenience was unlucky. Clara, who was very benevolent and went into medicine, used to prepared an herbal beer (Kr\u00e4uterbier) for the poor and sick, which was produced long after her death.H. Ch.
