Johannes Petrus Hoogenboom was born in Rotterdam to Johannes Petrus Hoogenboom senior and Catharina Schipperheijn. He was baptised on 4 May 1778 in Het Steiger. He made a career in the colonial administration of the Dutch Gold Coast and became acting governor-general after the death of Pieter Linthorst. During his time in office the Dutch cemetery was constructed. In an ironic twist of fate, Hoogenboom became one of the first people interred in the Dutch cemetery, after he was murdered by an angry mob outside the officer's club in Elmina on 4 August 1808. == Notes == == References == * * * * Category:1778 births Category:1808 deaths Category:Colonial governors of the Dutch Gold Coast ",
