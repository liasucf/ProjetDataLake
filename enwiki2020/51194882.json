He competed at the 1956 and 1960 Summer Olympics and placed fourth in 1960; he also finished fourth at the 1954 European Championships. Kutenko was seriously injured during a 1963 Soviet-American meetup in San Francisco, breaking several ribs and spending 40 days in a hospital. The accident left him with a failed kidney and forced him to retire. He later had a two-decade-long career as an athletics coach with the Soviet Army Sports Club. ==References== Category:1932 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Olympic athletes of the Soviet Union Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1956 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1960 Summer Olympics Category:Ukrainian decathletes Category:Soviet decathletes ",
