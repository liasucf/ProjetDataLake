    "text": "St. Paul's Chapel is an historic Carpenter Gothic style Episcopal church at Crownsville, Anne Arundel County, Maryland. It is a small board-and-batten frame church composed of a simple rectangular nave, a small entrance porch, a small deep chancel, and two very small utility sections added to the sides of the chancel. There is a small cemetery on the property dating from the 1860s. It may be an example of a church built by following plans of Richard Upjohn, the noted 19th-century American architect. St. Paul's Chapel is now part of St. Paul's Anglican Church in the Anglican Province of America. Its current rector is the Rev. Thomas Burr. Rev. Wesley Walker is the curate. The Right Rev. Robert Samuel Loiselle, Sr., who is also assistant bishop of the Anglican Province of America is the rector emeritus. In 2008, a new larger church building, designed to be compatible architecturally with the chapel was built next to it and the two were joined together.St. Paul's Anglican Church website Regular services using the 1928 Book of Common Prayer are held in the chapel and the main church at 8:00 am (chapel), 9:15 and 11:00 am every Sunday.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. ==References== ==External links== *, including undated photo, at Maryland Historical Trust *St. Paul's Anglican Church website Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Maryland Category:Episcopal church buildings in Maryland Category:Churches in Anne Arundel County, Maryland Category:Churches completed in 1865 Category:19th-century Episcopal church buildings Category:Carpenter Gothic church buildings in Maryland Category:National Register of Historic Places in Anne Arundel County, Maryland ",
