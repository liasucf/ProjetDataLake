Some blue cheeses are injected with spores before the curds form, and others have spores mixed in with the curds after they form. Blue cheeses are typically aged in a temperature-controlled environment such as a cave. Blue cheese can be eaten by itself or can be spread, crumbled or melted into or over foods. ==Blue cheeses== * \u00c4delost * Aura cheese * Beenleigh Blue * Bleu B\u00e9n\u00e9dictin * Bleu d'Auvergne * Bleu de Bresse * Bleu de Gex * Bleu des Causses * Bleu du Vercors-Sassenage * Bleuch\u00e2tel * Blue Cheshire * Brighton Blue * Buxton Blue * Cabrales cheese * Cambozola * Carr\u00e9 d'Aurillac * Cashel Blue * Castello * Cherni Vit * Danish Blue Cheese * Dolcelatte * Dorset Blue Vinney * Dovedale cheese * Dragon's Breath Blue * Fourme d'Ambert * Fourme de Montbrison * Gamalost * Gorgonzola * Grinzola * Kariki Tinou * Lanark Blue * Lymeswold cheese * Maytag Blue cheese * Norbury Blue * Oxford Blue * Pic\u00f3n Bejes-Tresviso * Remberter * Rogue River Blue * Rokpol * Roquefort * Saga * Saint Agur Blue * Shropshire Blue * Stichelton * Stilton cheese * Valde\u00f3n cheese * Wensleydale cheese ==See also== * List of cheeses * Blue cheese ==References== ==External links== * Category: Blue cheeses Category: Lists of cheeses ",
