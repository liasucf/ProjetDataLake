    "text": "Oregon Route 164 is an Oregon state highway running from Interstate 5 in Marion County north of Millersburg to I-5 at Millersburg in Linn County. OR 164 is known as the Jefferson Highway No. 164 (see Oregon highways and routes). It is long and runs north-south, primarily functioning as a loop road to Jefferson. OR 164 was established in 2002 as part of Oregon's project to assign route numbers to highways that previously were not assigned, and, as of July 2017, was unsigned. == Route description == OR 164 begins at an intersection with I-5 approximately north of Millersburg. It heads southeast and south to Jefferson, and then turns southwest to rejoin I-5 at Millersburg. == History == The Jefferson Highway was designated as US 99E in 1926. After the completion of the Willamette Valley section of Interstate 5 in the 1960s, US 99E between Salem and Albany was realigned to travel as one co-signed road with the new freeway. OR 164 was assigned to the Jefferson Highway in 2002. == Major intersections == == References == * Oregon Department of Transportation, Descriptions of US and Oregon Routes, https://web.archive.org/web/20051102084300/http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/HWY/TRAFFIC/TEOS_Publications/PDF/Descriptions_of_US_and_Oregon_Routes.pdf, page 27. * Oregon Department of Transportation, Jefferson Highway No. 164, ftp://ftp.odot.state.or.us/tdb/trandata/maps/slchart_pdfs_1980_to_2002/Hwy164_1997.pdf 164 Category:Transportation in Marion County, Oregon Category:Transportation in Linn County, Oregon ",
