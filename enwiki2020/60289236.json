Sex and gender as factors in romantic partnerships and best friendships. Journal of Relationships Research. 2013 Oct;4. ===Fatherhood=== As an evolutionary anthropologist, Machin believes that both mothers and fathers have been primed by evolution to parent their children. She has studied father-child relationships and takes the position that human fatherhood would not have developed unless the investment that fathers make in their children is vital for the survival of the species. She has concluded that fatherhood was fundamental to the development of humans and humanity, with fathers performing critical parenting tasks in coaching and educating their children. Machin has also studied the expectations and reality of fatherhood, and systemic impediments to fathers' involvement in their children's lives. ==Popular media== Machin has been interviewed and cited about fatherhood and love relationships by a variety of popular media outlets, including the New Scientist,Jessica Hamzelou, Dad power: The surprising new science of fatherhood, New Scientist, March 21, 2018.
