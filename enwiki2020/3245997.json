    "text": "Siu Sai Wan Extension is a proposed extension of the Island Line to Siu Sai Wan on the eastern end of the Hong Kong Island. A plan was revealed in 2001 after many calls from the Eastern District Board (later District Council) since 1991. Although the population size in Siu Sai Wan is large enough to support a station, the plan was later shelved, despite continued calls from the District Council. ==Proposals== In February 2013 review and update of the Railway Development Strategy 2000, Highway Departments proposed three schemes to extend the current railway network to Siu Sai Wan area, either by extending after the current Chai Wan Terminus, branching off from Heng Fa Chuen Station or constructing a new medium capacity railway system from Heng Fa Chuen. ===Extension=== An extension will extend the Island Line from the current south-eastern terminus Chai Wan Station to Siu Sai Wan. The alignment of the existing Island Line, however, makes it difficult to extend the line from the terminus Chai Wan Station. Such an extension would require a U-shaped tunnel passing through the Pottinger Peak. Certain nearby buildings will be demolished to make space for the extension. ===Bifurcation=== An alternative plan was to build a Y-shaped branch from Heng Fa Chuen Station. A bifurcation will require reclamation of the Chai Wan Cargo Handling Basin. However, because of the spur line, some trains will not stop at Chai Wan station, resulting in a lower train frequency. ===Feeder=== Siu Sai Wan residents using this feeder line will need to interchange at Heng Fa Chuen Station to the Island Line. This is similar to other road-based transport systems. While reclamation might not be required, private land and land for recreational purposes will need to be used for the construction of the feeder line. As the feeder line is built in the form of a viaduct, it will create permanent visual and noise impacts to nearby buildings. ==References== Category:MTR stations on Hong Kong Island Category:Siu Sai Wan Category:Proposed railway stations in Hong Kong ",
