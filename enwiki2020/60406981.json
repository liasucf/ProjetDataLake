    "text": "Palmyra is an unincorporated community in Lee County, in the U.S. state of Georgia. ==History== The community was named after the ancient city of Palmyra, in Syria. The Georgia General Assembly incorporated Palmyra as a town in 1840. With the construction of the railroad through the area and concerns that the community's low elevation was prone to mosquito-borne diseases, business activity shifted to nearby Albany, and the town's population dwindled. The Palmyra post office closed in 1891. The town's municipal charter was repealed in 1995. ==References== Category:Former municipalities in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Unincorporated communities in Lee County, Georgia Category:Populated places disestablished in 1995 ",
