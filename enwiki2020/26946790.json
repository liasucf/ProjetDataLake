    "text": "The Termite-leu RNA motif is a conserved RNA structure discovered by bioinformatics. It is found only in DNA sequences extracted from uncultivated bacteria living in termite hindguts, and has not yet been detected in any known cultivated organism. In many cases, Termite-leu RNAs are found in the likely 5\u2032 untranslated regions of multive genes related to the synthesis of the amino acid leucine. However, in several cases it is not found in this type of location. Therefore, it was considered ambiguous as to whether Termite-leu RNAs constitute cis-regulatory elements. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Cis-regulatory RNA elements Category:Non-coding RNA ",
