His family moved to Kansas, where he worked on the business and advertising staffs of The Wichita Eagle and Wichita Beacon newspapers. In 1942 he became an account executive of the San Francisco News and then sales manager of San Francisco radio station KYA, rising to president and general manager and collecting a Peabody Award for a program he developed. Los Angeles radio station KTMR was added to his charge when the New York Post bought it and KYA. KTMR became KLAC and added a television broadcast in 1948. Fedderson was in charge of radio and TV broadcasts for five years. Fedderson formed his own television company in 1953 and signed Liberace to a contract that put him before a nationwide TV audience. It was one of several shows starring the flamboyant pianist on network and syndicated television. Fedderson also produced the syndicated series \u2033Life With Elizabeth\u2033 starring Betty White in 1953-54, \u2033The Millionaire\u2033 with Marvin Miller on CBS from 1955-60, and \u2033Date with the Angels,\u2033 again with Miss White, on ABC in 1957-58. Fedderson\u2019s company became TV consultants to bandleader Lawrence Welk in 1954 and put him on ABC from 1955-71, then syndicated his program widely until 1982. Fedderson produced \u2033The Smith Family,\u2033 an ABC series starring Henry Fonda as a detective from 1971-72; \u2033To Rome With Love,\u2033 with John Forsythe, on CBS from 1969-71; and \u2033Family Affair,\u2033 starring Brian Keith as a substitute father for a nephew and two nieces, and Sebastian Cabot as his servant, which ran on CBS from 1966-71. Fedderson also delved successfully into game shows. He produced \u2033Do You Trust Your Wife\u2033 with Edgar Bergen as host of the primetime quiz show on CBS from 1956 to 1957. It then switched to ABC as a daytime show called \u2033Who Do You Trust?\u2033 starring Johnny Carson, who was joined in 1958 by sidekick Ed McMahon. The future \u2033Tonight Show\u2033 duo left in 1962, and the show, which by then sported a \u2033Whom\u2033 instead of a \u2033Who\u2033 in its title, ran through 1963 with host Woody Woodbury. Fedderson's biggest success on television, however, began in 1960 with My Three Sons, starring Fred MacMurray, of which Fedderson served as the executive producer. The show aired for five years on ABC and another seven on CBS, producing a total of 380 episodes, making it the fourth longest- running live-action sitcom amongst American prime-time network programs. On November 14, 1974, Fedderson received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contribution to the television industry, at 1735 N. Vine Street. ==Personal life== Fedderson was married to actress Helen Macie \"Tido\" Minor from 1938 to 1968. He fathered seven children, two of whom became actors: Gregg Fedderson and Mike Minor.
