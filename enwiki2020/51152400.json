It was formed to promote the interests of Kshatriya varna (caste) of the Indian society. Since 2004 Kunwar Haribansh Singh is Current National President.http://orahan.in/kunwar-harivansha-singh- mumbai/ ==Early years== Akhil Bhartiya Kshatriya Mahasabha came into existence on 19 Oct 1897, creating a platform to promote the cause of the Kashatriyas. A news letter called ' Rajput Monthly' was launched in 1898. The association had its first conference in the Rajput Boarding House at Agra. Maharaja Sir Pratap Singh of Jammu & Kashmir sponsored the launching of an Urdu publication called the Rajput Gazette as a fortnightly form Lahore. At that time the princely states rulers and large zamindars held the sway and they started various schools and colleges in their territories for education and giving preference to students of Kshatriya community. At the time of its foundation in 1897, during British India, the Kshatriyas held commanding position in the society, however, after independence, the situation changed dramatically for the upper Kshatriya caste and its influential members. The princely states were merged into the Union of India and later Zamindari was also abolished and association was directionless. But immediately after independence of India in 1947, under president ship of Babu Ram Narayan a meeting was held at Ujjain and association was revived. ==Centenary== The centenary celebration of the association was held in 1987 at New Delhi under president-ship of Raja Digvijaysinhji Prajapsinhji Jhala.Akhil Bharatiya Kshatriya Mahasabha ==Activities== As back as in year 1980 the association demanded that reservation should be given on economic basis rather than on caste basis. Again in the year 2001, a memorandum containing lacs of signatures was submitted to Hon'ble President of India through District Collectors, demanding reservation on economic basis rather than on caste basis. A nationwide rath yatra from Jammu to Kanyakumari demanding reservation on economic basis rather than on caste basis was flagged off in October 2010, which ended in March 2011. The association is today active in raising the issues related to Kshatriya community, for example in 2004 is launched a major campaign for released of various Kshatriya caste members jailed by Mayavati government. \ud835\udc0a\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc30\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc07\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc21 \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc21 \ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1f \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc25 \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc1a \ud835\udc0a\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc1a \ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfce\ud835\udfce\ud835\udfd2http://berojgarokitoli.com/harivansh-singh-elected- unopposed-president-of-akhil-bhartiya-kshatriya-mahasabha/\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0938\u092d\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u092b\u093f\u0930 \u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0930\u094b\u0927 \u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092f \u0905\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0937 \u091a\u0941\u0928\u0947 \u0917\u090f \u0915\u0941\u0902 \u0939\u0930\u093f\u0935\u0902\u0936 \u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939 - \u0905\u091c\u092f \u0915\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0930 \u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939 - https://parivartanchakra.page/FAAMJb.html On February 22, 2004, for the first time in history, Honorable Kunwar Haribansh Singh was elected the national president in a three-day open session.
