The nearest island is Rimatara situated to the ESE. The atoll consists of four islets (\u00eeles), with a dense atoll forest and a very shallow lagoon, supporting numerous bird species. The atoll is uninhabited now, but at one time was the site of a penal colony. Copra is occasionally harvested at the island. The four islands are: # \u00cele du Sud # \u00cele Centrale # \u00cele de l' Ouest # \u00cele du Nord\u00eat The \u00celes Maria should not be confused with Maria Atoll in the Gambier Islands, also in French Polynesia, which is sometimes differentiated with the name \"Maria Est\" (East). There is also another island once known as Hull Island in the Phoenix Islands, which is now known as Orona. ==History== Another left According to Polynesian legend, the uninhabited island was discovered by Chief Ama'itera'i of Rurutu in ancient times. It was made a place of exile by King Teuruarii IV and his mother and regent Taarouru. The island was also claimed by the neighboring island kingdom of Rimatara. The territorial dispute wouldn't be settled until 1937, when two of the four atolls were awarded to each party. This atoll is named for the whaler Maria, who sighted the island in 1824, It was captained by George Washington Gardner, a Nantucket sea captain (1778-1838).Dunmore, John (1992); Who's Who in Pacific Navigation, Australia:Melbourne University Press, , pp114-115 ==Administration== The atoll \u00celes Maria is administratively part of Rimatara commune (municipality) in the Tubuai (Austral Islands) division of French Polynesia. == References == ==External links== * - from OceanDots Category:Islands of the Austral Islands Category:Atolls of French Polynesia ",
