    "text": "Walter Alberto L\u00f3pez Gasco (born 15 October 1985) is a Uruguayan footballer who currently plays for Italian club Salernitana in defence or midfield. ==Career== Born in Montevideo, L\u00f3pez began his career at hometown club Racing Club and spent time in Argentina with San Mart\u00edn de Tucum\u00e1n, before moving to Uruguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n side River Plate Montevideo in 2005. While registered to the club, he spent time on loan in Spain, with Xerez, and in Mexico, with Tecos. He signed for West Ham United on 5 September 2008. On joining West Ham he was described by caretaker manager Kevin Keen as \"a very attacking full-back who can get forward. Like David Di Michele, he is another West Ham-type player who will hopefully show everyone at the club what he can do\". Michele had been signed by the club on loan around the same time. L\u00f3pez made his debut for West Ham United in a League Cup third round tie, playing the full game in an away defeat at Watford on 23 September 2008. He made his Premier League debut as a late substitute in West Ham's 1\u20130 win over Manchester City on 1 March 2009. L\u00f3pez failed to cement a place in the first team due to the presence of Congolese international H\u00e9rita Ilunga and, having made five substitute Premier League appearances, was subsequently released by West Ham at the end of the 2008\u201309 season. He returned to Uruguay and signed for Primera Divisi\u00f3n side Cerro. He was then loaned to Brescia of Italy's Serie B. He managed one goal for the Italians, his first outside of South America, in 29 appearances. In the summer of 2010, L\u00f3pez was loaned to Romanian Liga 1 side FC Universitatea Craiova. After a six-month loan, at the start of 2011, the club decided to buy the player and L\u00f3pez signed a contract for three years. In July 2011, L\u00f3pez moved back to Uruguay and joined Pe\u00f1arol. While signed to the club, he spent time on loan at Paraguayan club Cerro Porte\u00f1o in 2012. In March 2013, he was arrested and sentenced to 90 days of community service for \"crime simulation\", after setting fire to his truck and reporting it stolen in order to claim insurance money. L\u00f3pez left Pe\u00f1arol in September 2013, moving back to Italy to join Serie C club Lecce. After two seasons, he moved once again to Paraguay and joined Sol de Am\u00e9rica. A further spell in Italy followed, firstly with Campania club Benevento, before moving to Spezia in Liguria in August 2017. On 19 July 2018, he signed a two-year contract with another Serie C club Ternana. On 31 January 2019, he moved to Serie B club Salernitana. L\u00f3pez also holds a Spanish passport. ==International career== L\u00f3pez made three appearances for Uruguay in 2006. ==Honours== ;Cerro Porte\u00f1o *Paraguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n: 2012 Apertura ;Pe\u00f1arol *Uruguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n: 2012\u201313 ==References== ==External links== * * *Where Are They Now?: Walter Lopez, Moore Than Just A Club * Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Montevideo Category:Association football defenders Category:Uruguayan footballers Category:Uruguayan expatriate footballers Category:Uruguay international footballers Category:River Plate Montevideo players Category:Cerro Porte\u00f1o players Category:Pe\u00f1arol players Category:Tecos F.C. footballers Category:West Ham United F.C. players Category:Brescia Calcio players Category:Xerez CD footballers Category:San Mart\u00edn de Tucum\u00e1n footballers Category:FC U Craiova 1948 players Category:U.S. Lecce players Category:Benevento Calcio players Category:Spezia Calcio players Category:Ternana Calcio players Category:U.S. Salernitana 1919 players Category:Uruguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Premier League players Category:Serie B players Category:Liga I players Category:Serie C players Category:Paraguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Expatriate footballers in Argentina Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Expatriate footballers in Italy Category:Expatriate footballers in Mexico Category:Expatriate footballers in Paraguay Category:Expatriate footballers in Romania Category:Uruguayan expatriate sportspeople in Italy Category:Uruguayan expatriate sportspeople in Spain Category:Uruguayan expatriate sportspeople in England Category:Uruguayan expatriate sportspeople in Paraguay Category:Uruguayan expatriate sportspeople in Romania Category:Uruguayan expatriate sportspeople in Mexico Category:Uruguayan expatriate sportspeople in Argentina ",
