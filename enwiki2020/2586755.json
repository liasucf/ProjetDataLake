    "text": "Walter Gerardo Pandiani Urquiza (born 27 April 1976) is a Uruguayan former professional footballer who played as a striker, and a manager. His performances for Pe\u00f1arol earned him a move to Deportivo in Spain, where he remained for the vast majority of his career, also representing Mallorca, Espanyol (twice) and Osasuna. He also spent a year with Birmingham City in England. Over 12 seasons, Pandiani amassed La Liga totals of 279 games and 82 goals. ==Club career== ===Early years / Deportivo=== Born in Montevideo, Pandiani started his career with hometown club Progreso, moving on to Bas\u00e1\u00f1ez and Pe\u00f1arol, the latter also in the country's capital. In December 1999 he agreed terms to join Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a as a replacement for his compatriot Sergio Mart\u00ednez, and the move was officially completed the following January when he signed a five-and-a-half-year deal for an undisclosed fee, still remaining with Pe\u00f1arol until the end of the season. Pandiani made his debut for the Spaniards on 27 August 2000, coming from the bench for Diego Trist\u00e1n in a 2\u20130 win over Espanyol at Estadio Riazor in the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a return match. Despite never being an undisputed starter for the Galician team he was one of their most important attacking elements, often scoring as a substitute, netting 13 goals during the 2003\u201304 season. Pandiani, who had a successful loan stint at Mallorca while still at Depor, moved to Birmingham City in the Premier League, also on loan, in January 2005, after a series of run-ins with coach Javier Irureta. He scored a goal on his debut against Southampton in a 2\u20131 home win, and went on to score three more in the season, prompting manager Steve Bruce to sign him on a permanent contract for a reported fee of \u00a33 million. ===Espanyol=== Having failed to continue to display his previous form, Pandiani returned to Spain on 13 January 2006, after completing a move to Espanyol for \u00a31 million. In his first full season he scored only seven La Liga goals, including a first-half hat-trick against eventual champions Real Madrid in the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium, but was top scorer in the 2006\u201307 UEFA Cup with eleven as his club reached the final, which they lost on penalties to Sevilla. ===Osasuna=== For 2007\u201308, Pandiani joined Osasuna. Scarcely used in his first year, he was instrumental for the Navarrese in the following campaign, especially after the arrival in mid-October of coach Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho, finishing as the club's top scorer. Osasuna's first goal of the 2010\u201311 season only came in the fourth matchday, and the 34-year-old Pandiani scored it through a header as the team came from behind to win it 3\u20131 against Real Sociedad, at home. On 30 January 2011, during half-time of a 1\u20130 home win against Real Madrid, he was involved in a \"verbal spat\" with Cristiano Ronaldo, suggesting afterwards that \"As a footballer he is a phenomenon but to do the things he does, maybe he has a screw loose.\" ===Later career=== The 35-year-old Pandiani returned to Espanyol for 2011\u201312, signing a one-year contract and acting mainly as backup to youth graduate \u00c1lvaro V\u00e1zquez. On 22 September he came from the bench to score the game's only goal at home against Getafe, in stoppage time. On 27 October he repeated the feat, albeit not so late in the game, with a powerful header at home to Real Betis. In late August 2012, Pandiani signed a one-year contract with Segunda Divisi\u00f3n club Villarreal, where his 18-year-old son Nico was a C-team player. On his debut, at home to Guadalajara on 2 September, he entered the game as a second- half substitute and scored the winning goal, and did the same the following week in another narrow win, at Ponferradina. In late January 2013, Pandiani and Nico left Villarreal and joined Atl\u00e9tico Baleares of the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B. They both started in Nico's second senior match, and Pandiani scored in the 2\u20131 defeat away to Sant Andreu on 12 May. In October 2013, the pair returned to Uruguay and signed for Primera Divisi\u00f3n club Miramar Misiones. Pandiani scored three times in the six remaining matches of the 2013\u201314 Apertura, as his team finished next to bottom, and played regularly during the Clausura but scored only twice as they repeated their previous finish, which contributed to relegation. Pandiani returned to the Barcelona area where he spent the 2014\u201315 season coaching junior teams at Masnou, where two of his sons played. He said that although he had always wanted to coach, he still thought of himself as a player and was open to offers; in June 2015, he signed for Lausanne-Sport of the Swiss Challenge League, with the remit of supervising and teaching the tricks of the trade to the 15-year-old striker Andi Zeqiri, who had already made his first-team debut. Pandiani announced his retirement on 16 June 2016 after a 23-year professional career, at the age of 40. ===Coaching=== Pandiani returned to Masnou after retiring, now as a first-team manager. Sacked on 2 November 2016, he was appointed at the helm of Europa's Juvenil A squad on 13 December. On 27 June 2017, Pandiani was named manager of Hospitalet's youth squad. ==International career== Despite his relatively successful career in Spain, Pandiani only received four caps for Uruguay, the first coming on 28 March 2001 in a 1\u20130 home defeat against Paraguay in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers. ==Style of play== Nicknamed El Rifle (the rifle), Pandiani's best assets were his strength and aerial ability. ==Career statistics== ===International=== :Source: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |colspan=\"3\"|Uruguay |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |2001||1||0 |- |2002||0||0 |- |2003||1||0 |- |2004||2||0 |- !Total!!4!!0 |} ==Honours== Pe\u00f1arol *Uruguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n: 1999 Deportivo *Copa del Rey: 2001\u201302 *Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a: 2000, 2002 Mallorca *Copa del Rey: 2002\u201303 Espanyol *Copa del Rey: 2005\u201306 *UEFA Cup runner-up: 2006\u201307 ==References== ==External links== * *Deportivo archives * * * Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Montevideo Category:Uruguayan footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Uruguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Progreso players Category:Pe\u00f1arol players Category:Miramar Misiones players Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a players Category:RCD Mallorca players Category:RCD Espanyol footballers Category:CA Osasuna players Category:Villarreal CF players Category:CD Atl\u00e9tico Baleares footballers Category:Premier League players Category:Birmingham City F.C. players Category:Swiss Challenge League players Category:FC Lausanne-Sport players Category:Uruguay international footballers Category:Uruguayan expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Expatriate footballers in Switzerland Category:Uruguayan expatriate sportspeople in Spain Category:Uruguayan expatriate sportspeople in England Category:Uruguayan football managers Category:Lorca FC managers Category:Uruguayan expatriate football managers Category:Expatriate football managers in Spain ",
