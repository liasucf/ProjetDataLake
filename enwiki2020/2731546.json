    "text": "Kutch\u00e9 is a studio album from Algerian artists Cheb Khaled and Safy Boutella. It is the only collaboration between the two artists. Khaled would later rise to be one of the most famous ra\u00ef artists outside Algeria, while Safy Boutella would continue his career as a jazzman in Europe. The album was re-released by Stern's Music and Intuition Music. The title track Kutch\u00e9 is the cover of a popular Moroccan song, originally named Moul el Koutchi, covered by the Moroccan singer Milouda and in particular by the Moroccan singer Fay\u00e7al in 1986. This name comes from the Spanish coche and indicates horse-drawn carriages used for the transport of people, now mainly tourists, in cities like Marrakech or Meknes. The lyrics are very allusive and can be interpreted in different ways. La Camel is a cover of a Cheikha Rimitti song and Chebba is a cover of an Ahmed Zergui song. ==Track listing== # \"La Camel\" \u2013 5:33 # \"Kutch\u00e9\" \u2013 5:59 # \"El Lela\" \u2013 5:02 # \"Baroud\" \u2013 3:58 # \"Chebba\" \u2013 5:48 # \"Hana-Hana\" \u2013 5:26 # \"Chab Rassi\" \u2013 5:04 # \"Minuit\" \u2013 5:51 ==References== Category:Khaled (musician) albums Category:1988 albums ",
