Despite the name, the Sheffield Business Awards allows nominations for all businesses who are situated in the 'S' postcode area. This allows businesses in some areas of Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster to take part in the event. Businesses can nominate themselves or be nominated for one or more of several categories which are then judged by a panel of independent business leaders, Sheffield Chamber of Commerce representatives and representatives from the sponsoring organisations. The Outstanding Business of the Year Award is decided from all short-listed companies excluding Business Person of the Year and Young Business Person of the Year. ==The Ceremony== Each year a ceremony is held around the first week of December at Ponds Forge International Sports Centre. The event usually comprises a three course meal where several awards are presented between each course, culminating in the final award presented to the 'Outstanding Business of the Year'. The 2018 ceremony was hosted by BBC Breakfast\u2019s Dan Walker (broadcaster). The 2012 ceremony was hosted by Paul Zenon with local magician Steve Faulkner. The 2011 ceremony was again hosted by comedian and impressionist Jon Culshaw, back by popular demand. The 2010 ceremony was hosted by comedian and impressionist Jon Culshaw.
