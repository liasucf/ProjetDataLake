It is located between Chacewater and St Day villages and is three miles (5 km) east of Redruth.Ordnance Survey One-inch Map of Great Britain; Truro and Falmouth, sheet 190. 1961 During the 19th century, Todpool was an important site for tin mining due to its proximity to Poldice mine. Today, disused mineshafts and derelict engine houses are scattered throughout the area. Todpool was once busy enough to support a pub (now a private house) and a church, but is now a quiet backwater of miners' cottages. The road that runs through Todpool is Bownder An Sycamor, which translates from Cornish as Sycamore Lane. ==References== ==External links== Category:Hamlets in Cornwall ",
