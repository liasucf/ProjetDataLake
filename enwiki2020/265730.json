    "text": "The femtometre (American spelling femtometer, symbol fm derived from the Danish and Norwegian word femten, \"fifteen\" (15), Ancient Greek: , ', \"unit of measurement\") is an SI unit of length equal to 10\u221215 metres, which means a quadrillionth of one. This distance can also be called a fermi and was so named in honour of physicist Enrico Fermi, as it is a typical length-scale of nuclear physics. ==Definition and equivalents== 1000 attometres = 1 femtometre = 1 fermi = 0.001 picometre = femtometres = 10 \u00e5ngstr\u00f6m = 1 nanometre. For example, the charge radius of a proton is approximately 0.831 femtometres while the radius of a gold nucleus is approximately 8.45 femtometres.Blatt, John M.; Weisskopf, Victor F. (1952), Theoretical Nuclear Physics, New York: Wiley, pp. 14\u201316. 1 barn = 100 fm2 ==History== The femtometre was adopted by the 11th Conf\u00e9rence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Poids et Mesures, and added to the SI in 1964. The fermi is named after the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi (1901\u20131954), one of the founders of nuclear physics. The term was coined by Robert Hofstadter in a 1956 paper published in Reviews of Modern Physics entitled \"Electron Scattering and Nuclear Structure\".Hofstadter, Robert, Department of Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, California, \"Electron Scattering and Nuclear Structure,\" Rev. Mod. Phys. 28, 214\u2013254 (1956) \u00a9 1956 The American Physical Society The term is widely used by nuclear and particle physicists. When Hofstadter was awarded the 1961 Nobel Prize in Physics, it subsequently appeared in the text of his 1961 Nobel Lecture, \"The electron-scattering method and its application to the structure of nuclei and nucleons\" (December 11, 1961).Hofstadter, Robert, \"The electron-scattering method and its application to the structure of nuclei and nucleons,\" Nobel Lecture (December 11, 1961) ==References== 8\\. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/femtometre Category:Units of length de:Meter#Dezimale Vielfache ru:\u0424\u0435\u043c\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440 ",
