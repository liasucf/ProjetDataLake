    "text": "The May consultations were an underground gathering of the Central Committee (Politburo) of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CPY) and leaders of its regional branches held after World War II in Yugoslavia started, on the initiative of Josip Broz Tito in early May 1941 in Zagreb, at the time part of the so-called Independent State of Croatia (modern-day Croatia). The exact place and date of the consultations is unknown, but based on the first records about it, it is assumed that it was held in Zagreb at the beginning of May 1941. The participants were communists from regional committees of Croatia, Slovenia and Montenegro. The communists from Serbia and Macedonia did not attend it. The purpose of the consultations was to discuss the reasons for the defeat of the Yugoslav Royal Army during the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia and the consequences of the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, and consequent further directives for the members of the CPY. The conclusions were subsequently interpreted and published in different records, and contained several key points aimed against Greater Serbian reactionary bourgeoisie, considered by them to be truly at fault for the war, and in favor of a Croatian state that would not actually be a fascist puppet state. At the time, however, their main point was to present to the Yugoslav public that communists of Yugoslavia had plans to struggle against the Axis occupation despite the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact. The CPY decided to organize the Military committees with each of its regional branches in Yugoslavia, similar to the Military committee of the Politburo established on 10 April 1941. == April meetings of communists in Zagreb == After the beginning of the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia during April 1941, the Central Committee of the CPY and the Communist Party of Croatia held several meetings in April 1941 about the activities of the communists in Axis occupied Yugoslavia.:\"..Pitanje utvr\u0111ivanja sudionika Savjetovanja usko je povezano s pitanjem same svrhe toga sastanka I priprema za nj. Rije\u010d je o tome da su sastancima \u010dlanova CK KPJ i Ci This meetings determined the necessity to organize May consultations with representatives of the national and regional Yugoslav communist leaders.:\"..Po svoj prilici je na toj sjednici III ubrzo nakon nje donesena odluka o sazivanju \u0161irega jpartljskog savjetovanja na koje bi se pozvali predstavnici nacionalnih I pokrajinskih loikovodstava. ,...\" On 15 April 1941 the CPY published proclamation from which Tito in his later interpretations emphasized that \"It was necessary to inform people in advance - the struggle will be very bloody because there will be no return to old Yugoslavia, in which workers were exploited and people without any rights\".:\"...nema povratka na staro, na staru Jugoslaviju u kojoj su radne mase bile ugnjetene i' eksploatisane, a narodi obespravljeni,...\" == Date of the consultations == The first sources, including text published in Proleter, explained that the consultations were organized in the beginning of May 1941. Different later interpretations about the exact date of the consultations from Vladimir Dedijer, a main official biographer of Josip Broz, raised doubts that this consultations even happened at all.:\"Bez ikakvih novih argumenata Iskonstruirao je kvalitetno nove podatke o Savjetovanju, dovode\u0107i u sumnju njegovo odr\u017eavanje\" Some historians, including Veselin \u0110ureti\u0107, believe that the consultations have never happened. The communist historiography explained the different interpretations of the exact date with necessity to keep the date as secret, but this argument is not valid.:\"Tvrdnja da se u spomenutim primarnim dokumentima \u00bbzbog konspiracije\u00ab nije dao tobo\u017enji pravi datum, tj. da je Savjetovanje odr\u017eano potkraj travnja, nema nikakve \u010dvr\u0161\u0107e osnove\" == Participants == The consultations of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia were initiated by Josip Broz Tito and attended by delegates from almost all parts of Axis occupied Yugoslavia. The meeting was attended by all members of the Politburo except Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107::\"...Najprije treba konstatirati da su Savjetovanju prisustvovali svi \u010dlanovi Politi\u010dkog biroa Centralnog komiteta KPJ osim Aleksandra Rankovi\u0107a.

Protiv takve 'nezavisne' dr\u017eave Hrvatske nismo samo mi, ve\u0107 i 99 posto hrvatskog naroda.\u00ab\" One of the most important remarks of the leaders of Yugoslav Communist Party was their determined rejection of accusations coming from Greater Serbian circles that Croats are responsible for \"quick capitulation of Yugoslav Army\".:\"Jedna od bitnih i najzna\u010dajnijih ocjena rukovodstva KPJ na Savjetovanju sastojala se u odlu\u010dnom suprotstavljanju svim optu\u017ebama koje su potjecale iz velikosrpskih krugova: da hrvatski narod snosi glavnu krivicu za \u00bbbrzu kapitulaciju jugoslavenske vojske\u00ab. \" The Yugoslav Communists concluded that most important reason for quick defeat of Yugoslav Army in April war was policy of Greater Serbian bourgeoisie which exploited for more than 20 years people of Yugoslavia.:\"Majsko savjetovanje posebnu je pozornost obratilo analizi uzroka onako munjevitog sloma Kraljevine Jugoslavije u travanjskom ratii. U toj je analizi rukovodstvo KPJ istaklo nekoliko presudnih \u010dinilaca: politiku nacionalnog tla\u010denja koju su provodili re\u017eimi velikosrpske bur\u017eoazije vi\u0161e od _dvadeset godina; \" The Yugoslav communists underlined that they know that Serbs have nothing in common with those treacherous Serbian gentlemen.:\" kao \u0161to nema ni\u0161ta zajedni\u010dko ni srpski narod sa izdajni\u010dkom klikom vladaju\u0107e srpske gospode.\" The Yugoslav communists emphasized that Serbian reactionary bourgeoisie is guilty for the tragedy of Serbs and all other Yugoslav nations and that Serbs will first invite them to meet the justice at the right time because Serbian bourgeoisie is main cause of all evil that happened to Serbs and other nations of Yugoslavia.:\" Ali srpski narod predobro zna da je glavni krivac sada\u0161nje njegove tragedije, kao i tragedije svih naroda Jugoslavije, ba\u0161 srpska reakcionarna vladaju\u0107a bur\u017eoazija i nju \u0107e u prvom redu pozvati na odgovornost kada za to kucne \u010das. Ona je glavni krivac svega zla koje je zadesilo kako srpski tako i ostale narode Jugoslavije.\u00ab \" The Yugoslav Communists rejected accusations of Usta\u0161e propaganda that they were against Independent State of Croatia (NDH) because they were against independence of the Croats. The conclusions of the May consultations rejected such accusations and emphasized that Yugoslav Communists are not against independence of Croats, underlining that majority of Croats and Croatian nationalists knew very well that the main cause of the struggle of Yugoslav communists is liberation of all Yugoslav nations from exploitation of the Greater Serbian bourgeoisie, but in the first place for liberation of Croat nation.:\" KP je odlu\u010dno odbijala optu\u017ebe, koje joj je tada upu\u0107ivala usta\u0161ka propaganda, da su komunisti \u00bbprotiv nezavisnosti hrvatskog naroda\u00ab. U vezi s tim u zaklju\u010dcima Savjetovanja isti\u010de se: \u00bbRazumije se da je to obi\u010dna la\u017e i kleveta. Mislimo da je dovoljno dobro poznato ve\u0107ini hrvatskog naroda, a i nekim frankovcima koji su sjedili na robiji zajedno s komunistima, da smo mi, komunisti, ba\u0161 zbog toga i navukli veliku mr\u017enju na sebe od strane velikosrpske bur\u017eoazije \u0161to smo se borili za nacionalno oslobo\u0111enje ugnjetenih naroda Jugoslavije, a u prvom redu hrvatskog naroda\" The CPY stated that it is against NDH because it is not an independent Croatia, but a simple Italian province subjected to robbery of Italian and German imperialist thieves. That kind of \"independent\" Croatia is what they are against, together with 99% of Croats.:\" Istina je da smo mi protiv takve 'Nezavisne Dr\u017eave Hrvatske' kakva je danas, kakvu su skrpili Paveli\u0107 i njegova bratija zajedno sa Mussolinijem i Hitlerom, jer to nije nikakva nezavisna dr\u017eava Hrvatska, nego obi\u010dna talijanska provincija, objekt plja\u010dke njema\u010dkih i talijanskih imperijalisti\u010dkih razbojnika.

The absence of the written documents from this consultations and different interpretations of the key details brought into doubt that these consultations has even occurred. == Report to Comintern about the consultations == After May consultations Tito went to German occupied Belgrade where he resided until September 1941. At that time the Soviet Union had its embassy in Belgrade which was active even after the Axis occupied Yugoslavia because the Soviet Union and Germany were still allies until 22 June 1941. Tito delivered report to Moscow trough officer in Soviet Embassy in Belgrade. His report had two main points::\"Tito je u svom izvje\u0161taju rukovodstvu Kominterne ukazao na dva bitna momenta.
