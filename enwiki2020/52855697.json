The game was first released worldwide as a launch title for the Nintendo Switch in March 2017, and later for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in June 2018. It is also the first main Bomberman entry in over six years, as well as being the first to be developed following the dissolution of original series developer Hudson Soft on March 1, 2012. The game received mixed reviews, though many of the criticisms were addressed with post-release patches. By August 2018, the game had sold over a million units worldwide. Its battle royale spin-off, Super Bomberman R Online, was released on Stadia on September 1, 2020. ==Gameplay== Super Bomberman R is an action game in which players move through a two-dimensional grid environment and must trap and drop bombs to defeat their opponents. The game features story mode spanning 50 stages and supports cooperative gameplay for two players. The game also features an eight-player competitive multiplayer mode. The online mode contains a league system (Baby A/B, Novice A/B, Amateur A/B, Pro A/B, Champ A/B and God A/B). Starting in Baby league B the player has to win matches to gather and earn points for advancement. Battle mode includes 19 battlegrounds in total. Besides the classic arena, it also offers a multi-level arena with springboards, ice-patterns, moveable blocks, etc., each with a unique style. In addition to the eight Bomberman Bros. and the Five Dastardly Bombers, Super Bomberman R also features a selection of new characters based on Konami Originals, such as Dracula Bomber, Vic Viper Bomber, Goemon Bomber and more. In total, there are 27 characters, each with special abilities. Grand Prix was introduced with an update in November 2017. It contains 3 vs 3 battles in offline or online matches within 3 different arenas. Alongside new characters (with unique abilities) the player's goal is to collect as many gems as possible within the given time. Alternate mode is team fight which counts the total wins (blow-ups). ==Characters== Alucard Bomber's special ability is Mist (\u30df\u30b9\u30c8, misuto). He can transform into a ball of mist for about one second. During this time, he is invulnerable to explosions and hazards, and can pass through bombs. His movement speed does not change. When the effect ends, he pauses in place to revert to his base form; this pause also lasts about one second. There is a cooldown of about seven seconds before he can use Mist again. Option Bomber A & B - Trace: Copies the abilities and special abilities of characters upon contact. Reiko Bomber - Body Shield: Activates a surrounding shield that blocks characters and bomb blasts from entering. Shiori Fujisaki Bomber - Tokimeki Field: Stops all nearby characters from moving for a short time. Jehuty Bomber - Zero Shift A: Warps next to the first opponent in the direction the character is facing, up to a maximum of 8 squares away. Anubis Bomber - Zero Shift B: Swaps positions with the first opponent in the direction the character is facing, up to a maximum of 8 squares away. Dracula Bomber - Dark Curse: Set up to 4 invisible magic circles that deflect bombs placed on top of them. Princess Tomato Bomber - Princess Light: Characters touched will become immune to explosions. Bubble Head Bomber - Cursed: Inflict the Skull effect on yourself. Goemon Bomber - Oedo Blaster: Place as many bombs as possible in front of you. Simon Belmont Bomber - whip can also stun opponents. Magnet Bomber will slide towards opponents if they're in the bomb's lane. Golem Bomber Golem Bomber's special ability is the Golem Bomb (\u30b4\u30fc\u30ec\u30e0\u30dc\u30e0, g\u014dremu bomu). This alternate bomb type is heavy, and cannot be punched or kicked by any character other than Golem Bomber or another copy of him. Any character hit by a punched or thrown Golem Bomb, including Golem Bomber himself, w Phantom Bomber can drop fake bombs to throw opponents off. Karaoke/Sexy Bomber (and another character) has a proximity bomb that will automatically explode if an opponent is in its radius. Plasma Bomber drops a bomb with a unique timer. The longer you hold the special button, the longer the timer on the bomb. If you simply tap the button, it'll explode in half of the time of a regular bomb. Pretty Bomber Octopus Bomber Pyramid Head Bomber Dracula Bomber Vic Viper Bomber Max Bomber (Nintendo Switch Exclusive) Ratchet & Clank Bomber (Rachet & Clank Series, PS4 exclusive) Master Chief Bomber (Halo Series, Xbox One Exclusive) P-Body Bomber (Portal Series, Steam Exclusive) Xavier Woods Bomber Ayako Katagiri Bomber's special ability is the Tokimeki Love Song (\u3068\u304d\u3081\u304d\u30e9\u30d6\u30bd\u30f3\u30b0, tokimeki rabusongu). When activated, she will stand still and sing for three seconds. She can cancel this ability at any time by pressing the special ability button again. There is no cooldown for using this ability normally. However, when a character touches Ayako Katagiri Bomber during her song, the song ends immediately, and there will then be a ten second cooldown before Ayako Katagiri Bomber can trigger the ability again. While Ayako Katagiri Bomber is singing, any character who touches her will gain an \"Action Power Up\" effect, which gives them the Punch, Bomb Kick, and Power Glove abilities for thirty seconds. This does not generate new item panels. If a character who has been granted the Power Glove is still holding a bomb when the effect ends, they will still be able to carry the bomb indefinitely and throw it on command. However, if the character kicks a bomb, they cannot stop the kicked bomb after the effect ends. If a character who has the Action Power Up effect touches Ayako Katagiri Bomber during her song, the effect's length will be reset to thirty seconds. Toro ==Plot== The game features a rebooted plot of previous Super Bomberman games. It starts in a robot scrapyard, where Emperor Buggler resurrects five robots to be his new henchmen, the Five Dastardly Bombers. Meanwhile, on Planet Bomber, live the Bomberman Brothers; eight robotic lifeforms created to be heroes of the universe. Unfortunately, only the eldest brother, White, has the mentality and discipline associated with this role and has no luck getting his younger siblings to take their mission seriously. Black is a self-absorbed slacker, Pink is more concerned about fashion and gossip, Blue sleeps all day, Red is an out-of-control hothead, Yellow is innocent to a fault, Aqua hates violence, and Green is a cunning sneak who uses his status as the baby brother to manipulate his siblings. During yet another of White's attempts to get his siblings to train with him, their television begins broadcasting a signal from Buggler, who proclaims his goal to conquer the universe and shows that his army has taken control of the five planets of the Starry Sky Nebula; swearing that all other planets will soon follow. He offers a challenge to anyone who would defy him to fight his Five Dastardly Bombers. White immediately takes up the challenge and forces his siblings to come with him as he heads to the Starry Sky Nebula to face the Buggler army. ==Release== Super Bomberman R was developed by Konami and HexaDrive, and several people involved in the game are former Hudson Soft staff who had worked in past Bomberman titles.
