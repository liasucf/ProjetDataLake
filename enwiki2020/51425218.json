Essentially a garden railway, the line is unusual for its gauge of , usually associated with more extensive rail networks. The line is powered by overhead electric cables, with the power transmitted to the tramcars via pantograph, which is also highly unusual in the gauge. Although few private homes are able to accommodate a railway of gauge, the Pindal Electric Tramway operates, by agreement with the City of Oakville, partly on Pindal's private property, and partly on land owned by the City. ==Rolling stock== The Pindal Electric Tramway operates a fleet of seven scale electric tramcars, and several passenger trailers, as well as a small number of flatbed and freight trailers. ==References== Category:15 in gauge railways ",
