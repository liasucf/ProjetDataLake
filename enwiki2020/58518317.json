    "text": "Malcolm Keith Stephens (17 February 1930 \u2013 6 February 2005) was an English professional footballer who played as an inside forward in the Football League for Brighton & Hove Albion, Rotherham United and Doncaster Rovers. ==Life and career== Stephens was born in 1930 in Doncaster, which was then in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Described as a \"stocky little inside forward\", he joined Brighton & Hove Albion straight from his Royal Navy service, and scored at a rate of a goal every other game. However, in competition with Albert Mundy and Denis Foreman, he was unable to establish himself as a first-team regular, and moved on to Rotherham United and then Doncaster Rovers. He died in Plymouth, Devon, in 2005 at the age of 74. ==References== Category:1930 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Doncaster Category:English footballers Category:Association football inside forwards Category:Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. players Category:Rotherham United F.C. players Category:Doncaster Rovers F.C. players Category:English Football League players ",
