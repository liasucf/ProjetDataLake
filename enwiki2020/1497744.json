The series was also a joint collaboration between Ishimori Productions and Toei and was shown on TV Asahi from January 28, 2001 to January 27, 2002. The series served as an indirect sequel to Kamen Rider Kuuga and the first Kamen Rider series to not have an ending sequence. ==Story== A man named Shouichi Tsugami has no memory of who he was, where he came from, or how he came upon his peculiar circumstances to transform into a powerful superhuman, Kamen Rider Agito, whenever in the presence of the beings referred by the police as the \"Unknown\". Known as the Lords, these powerful monsters perceived themselves as humanity's defenders and kill certain people in a series of murders that force the police department to make Makoto Hikawa the user of the Kamen Rider G3 powersuit which was modeled after Kamen Rider Kuuga. Shouichi and Makoto, both initially hesitant of the other at first, are joined by Ry\u014d Ashihara, who becomes a pre-Agito known as Kamen Rider Gills and seeks the truth behind his father's suicide. These mysteries and many others collide as the true nature of Agito would ultimately determine the fate of humanity. ==Episodes== # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # ==Movies and specials == Aratanaru Henshin Title Banner *TV Special: Originally aired on October 1, 2001 between Episodes 35 and 36, the special features all three Riders plus the first appearances of G3 Mild and Agito Shining Form. Shouichi encounters psychologist Azuma Kunieda, who had once nursed him back to health, fights an Unknown at night and reaches Burning Form, but goes out of control. Then, Kunieda helps him control it. All three Riders fight against the Beetle Lord. The story ended with a mysterious girl stalking G4 and was to be continued in the movie. There is a difference concerning the series' plot and the special's plot. In the special, T\u014dru H\u014dj\u014d finds out the truth about Shouichi's identity by secretly hearing a conversation between him and Kunieda as he stands behind a window and listens to them. In the series, however, H\u014dj\u014d ambushes Agito as he flees from the battle scene and sees as he reverts to Shouichi, ultimately arresting him. It is possible, however, that he did not believe Shouichi in his conversation without physical evidence. * Released in theatres on 22 September 2001, Project G4 was a double bill with the Hyakujuu Sentai Gaoranger movie, \"Fire Mountain Howls!\".
