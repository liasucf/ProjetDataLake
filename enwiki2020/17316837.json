The Mulliner version of the story was included in the collection Mulliner Nights (1933).McIlvaine (1990), pp. 63\u201364, A48. \"Best Seller\" was rewritten from an earlier story, \"Parted Ways\", which was published in the UK in the Strand in December 1914, and in the US in Pictorial Review in June 1915. ==Plot== Egbert Mulliner, a literary critic, falls in love with Evangeline Pembury while recovering from an overdose of interviewing female novelists. After ensuring that she doesn't secretly write novels or short stories, he confesses his love to her and she reciprocates. Love, however, makes Evangeline write a romantic novel 'Parted Ways' which ends up becoming a best seller. A literary agent arrives, Egbert finds himself cut off from his love, and the couple 'part ways'. A change comes over Egbert and, whenever a female novelist has to be interviewed, Egbert boldly goes. Thus, he finds himself interviewing Evangeline for an article for his paper. Evangeline breaks down, confesses that she has committed to writing three novels and several short stories but cannot write another word, and Egbert steps into the breach with novels that he had written when but a struggling young man. ==Publication history== \"Best Seller\" was illustrated by James Montgomery Flagg in Cosmopolitan.McIlvaine (1990), p. 148, D17.49.
