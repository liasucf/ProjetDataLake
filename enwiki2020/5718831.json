    "text": "Edmund Dantes Lowe (March 3, 1890 \u2013 April 21, 1971) was an American actor. His formative experience began in vaudeville and silent film. ==Biography== Lowe was born in San Jose, California. His father was a local judge. His childhood home was at 314 North 1st Street, San Jose. He attended Santa Clara College and entertained the idea of becoming a priest before starting his acting career. He died in Woodland Hills, California, of lung cancer and is buried at San Fernando Mission Cemetery, Mission Hills, California.Wilson, Scott. Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons, 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Locations 28770-28771). McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition. ==Film career== Lowe's career included over 100 films in which he starred as the leading man. He is best remembered for his role as Sergeant Quirt in the 1926 movie, What Price Glory. (Lowe reprised his role from the movie in the radio program Captain Flagg and Sergeant Quirt, broadcast on the Blue Network September 28, 1941 - January 25, 1942, and on NBC February 13, 1942 - April 3, 1942.) Making a smooth transition to talking pictures he remained popular but by the mid 1930s he was no longer a major star although he occasionally played leading man to the likes of Mae West and Claudette Colbert. He portrayed the young doctor trying to get out of an affair with Wallace Beery's character's wife, played by Jean Harlow, in Dinner at Eight (1933). He remained a supporting actor at the major studios while continuing in leads for such \"Poverty Row\" studios as Columbia Pictures where his skills could bolster low budget productions. He also starred in 35 episodes of the 1950s television show, Front Page Detective and appeared as the elderly lead villain in the first episode of Maverick opposite James Garner in 1957. ==Marriages== After his first marriage to Esther Miller ended in early 1925, Lowe met Lilyan Tashman while filming Ports of Call. Lowe and Tashman were wed on September 21, 1925. The wedding occurred before the release of the film. The two had California homes in Beverly Hills and Malibu. They were married until Tashman's death from cancer at age 37 in 1934. Seventy years after Tashman\u2019s death, a book author named E.J. Fleming claimed that Edmund Lowe was a homosexual and that Tashman was a lesbian.The Fixers: Eddie Mannix, Howard Strickling and the MGM Publicity Machine By E.J. Fleming p.104 If the claims were true, fan magazine writers and newspaper columnists made no mention of them during Tashman\u2019s lifetime or for seventy years after her death.The Fixers: Eddie Mannix, Howard Strickling and the MGM Publicity Machine By E.J. Fleming p.104 Lowe's third wife was costume designer Rita Kaufman. They were married from 1936 to 1950. ==Filmography== Lowe with Dolores del R\u00edo and Victor McLaglen in What Price Glory?
