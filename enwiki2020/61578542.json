    "text": "Yassin Karim, (born 1 February 1997) is an Iraqi goalkeeper who currently plays for Al-Minaa in the Iraqi Premier League. ==Club Career== ===Al Mina'a=== Yassin signed for Basrawi club Al-Minaa on August 2016 from Iraq Division One side Al-Sulaymaniyah FC. In his first season with the club, he played 27 games, keeping 15 clean sheets. He helped the club achieve a 6th place finish in the league and reached the semi-final of the Iraq FA Cup, losing on penalties to Naft Al-Wasat. Yassin caused controversy by refusing to play against Zakho FC, presumably because of his Kurdish heritage. He was released following the end of the season and trained with Al-Talaba and signed with Al-Najaf but returned to Al-Minaa before the start of the season. The following season, Yassin and the entire team underperformed heavily as the team fell from sixth to fifteenth in the season due to administrative problems. Yassin kept six clean sheets in sixteen games. In the 18-19 season, administrative and financial problems continued to hit Al-Minaa, and the club narrowly avoided an exit from the top flight, finishing two places above the relegation zone in 17th. Yassin played 26 games in the league, keeping eight clean sheets. He missed a game through injury against Al-Hussein. Yassin once again renewed his contract with Al Minaa for the 2019-2020 season In the 19/20 season, Yasin Karim started off the season with a clean sheet in a 1-0 victory over Zakho FC == sources == Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Iranian people of Iraqi descent Category:People from Naqadeh Category:Iranian footballers Category:Iraqi footballers Category:Kurdish sportspeople Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Al-Mina'a SC players ",
