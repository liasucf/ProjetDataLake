    "text": "Kamila Valeryevna Valieva (, ; born 26 April 2006) is a Russian figure skater. She is the 2020 Junior World champion, the 2019 Junior Grand Prix Final champion, and the 2020 Russian junior champion. She currently holds the junior world records for the highest total and free skate scores. She maintains the title of Junior Grand Prix champion due to the cancellation of all Junior Grand Prix events for the 2020-21 season. https://www.goldenskate.com/2020-21-isu-figure-skating-results/ At the 2019 JGP France she became the second female skater behind Alexandra Trusova to land the quadruple toe loop jump. == Personal life == Valieva was born in 2006 in Kazan, Russia. On January 12, 2019, Valieva's coach Eteri Tutberidze uploaded a photo of Valieva in her short program for the season 2018/19 with the caption 'My favourite programme of the year'. After watching Valieva's performance in her 2018/19 short program which was inspired by a painting Girl on a Ball by Pablo Picasso, his granddaughter Diana Widmaier Picasso invited Kamila to Paris. == Career == === Early career === Valieva at the 2018 Rostelecom Cup gala Valieva began skating in 2009 in RSDUSSHOR in Kazan. Her first coach was Ksenia Ivanova, then later she was coached by Marina Kudriavtseva and Igor Lyutikov, then Natalia Dubinskaya.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDzS6yce1T8&t;=4s When she turned 6 she moved to Moscow and started training in SSHOR 'Moskvich'. Although the girl in contrast with her team mates obviously stood out, there was not much progress and her mother wanted her to quit figure skating. But before doing so, they decided to switch skating clubs and tryout at Sambo-70, where Eteri Tutberidze decided to allow Valieva to join her group. In the 2018-2019 season, prior to her international debut, recordings of Valieva's short program set to Spiegel im Spiegel by Arvo P\u00e4rt and inspired by Pablo Picasso's painting Girl on a Ball received worldwide attention. Among other victories that season, she won the Russian Younger Age Championships ahead of training mate Sofia Akatieva and Sofia Samodelkina. It was later announced that she would keep her short program for her international debut in the upcoming season. === 2019\u20132020 season: Junior World champion === Valieva's international debut came in late August 2019 at a 2019\u201320 ISU Junior Grand Prix (JGP) competition in Courchevel, France. Ranked third in the short program and first in the free skate, she won the gold medal ahead Wi Seo-yeong of South Korea and teammate and training partner Maiia Khromykh. At this competition, Valieva became only the second female ever to land quadruple toe loop in competition. Her total score at the event was the fourth highest score achieved by a ladies' single skater on the junior level, behind her teammates Alexandra Trusova, Anna Shcherbakova, and Alena Kostornaia. Valieva also became the fourth junior lady to score above 200 points under the current GOE (Grade of Execution) system. One month later, at the 2020 JGP Russia, she placed first in both programs with personal best scores to take the title ahead of compatriots Ksenia Sinitsyna and Viktoria Vasilieva. She attempted two quadruple toe loops in the free skate for the first time, landing one. With two gold medals, she qualified in first place to the 2019\u201320 Junior Grand Prix Final in Turin, Italy. Prior to the 2019\u201320 Junior Grand Prix Final in December, a minor injury prevented Valieva from training the quadruple toeloop jump. She entered the final as a co-favorite for the title along with Alysa Liu of the United States. After placing fourth in the short program, Valieva delivered a clean free skate to take the title ahead of Liu, who dropped from first place in the short program after under-rotating several of her jumps, and training mate Daria Usacheva. At 13 years old, Valieva was too young to enter the senior-level 2020 Russian Championships in December. In early February, Valieva instead competed at the 2020 Russian Junior Championships, which she won after placing first in both programs ahead of training mates Sofia Akatieva and Daria Usacheva. She once again included two quadruple toeloop jumps in her free skate, after recovering from her previous injury, stepping out on one and landing another in combination with a double toeloop. After the competition, she was named to the Russian team for the 2020 World Junior Championships in along with teammates Usacheva, who placed third, and Khromykh, who placed fifth, as silver medalist Akatieva and fourth-place finisher Sofia Samodelkina were too young to be eligible. The 2020 World Junior Championships were again seen by many as a showdown between Valieva and Alysa Liu, who had recently defended her title at the senior-level 2020 U.S. Championships. Valieva placed first in the short program ahead of Lee Hae-in of South Korea and Usacheva, setting a new personal best. Her score of 74.92 points was the second highest short program score ever for a junior lady, only behind training partner Alena Kostornaia's short program at the 2018\u201319 Junior Grand Prix Final. In the free skate, she performed similarly to the Russian Junior Championships, stepping out on her opening quadruple toeloop and landing all other jumps cleanly, including a second quadruple toeloop in combination. She placed first in that segment with a new junior world record score of 152.38 points, surpassing training partner Alexandra Trusova's free skate score at the 2019 World Junior Championships. She won the title and become the new Junior World Champion ahead of Usacheva and Liu. Valieva remarked afterward that \"there was a little mistake on the toe loop, but basically I am pleased with my performance.\" === 2020\u20132021 season === Valieva skated at the 2020 Russian Test Skates in Moscow, showcasing her new programs for the 2020-21 season. She executed a quad toe combination in her free skate.https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/stories/news/detail/kolyada-comeback- medvedeva-new-choreo-5-things-from-russian-test-skate/She competed at the second stage of the Russian Cup. There, she placed first in the short program with a flawless performance, but placed third for the free program with several unexpected mistakes causing her to obtain second place, winning the silver medal.https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/stories/news/detail/kolyada- comeback-medvedeva-new-choreo-5-things-from-russian-test-skate/ == Programs == {|class=wikitable style=text-align:center !
