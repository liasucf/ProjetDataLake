    "text": "The Mexican box turtle (Terrapene mexicana) is a species of box turtle belonging to the family Emydidae. It is sometimes treated as a subspecies of Terrapene carolina (Terrapene carolina mexicana). ==Geographic range== This species is endemic to Mexico. It is found in the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz and San Luis Potos\u00ed.iNaturalist ==Habitat== It lives in areas with tropical climates within humid forests at shallow rainwater puddles.Herpetomania ==Description== Terrapene mexicana can reach a length of about . The carapace is long and dome-shaped, with rather variable color and markings. The adult males show gray-blue nuances on the head and red or orange nuances on the front legs. ==Biology== The Mexican box turtle does not have much information on them because very few of them are domesticated (kept as pets). However, we do know that they have a lifespan of 100 years. Usually these turtles have water nearby homes and a bush to hide. Having a home by the water will attract insects, which are a big part of their diet. ==Gallery== Image: Emydidae - Terrapene mexicana (Mexican Box Turtle) (2).jpg|Terrapene mexicana at the Zoo Atlanta Image:Terrapene carolina mexicana.jpg|A Mexican box turtle on display in Gothenburg Natural History Museum Image: CistudoMexicanaFord.jpg|Illustration from Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London 1848-1849 File:Terrapene mexicana, Mexican Box Turtle, Tamaulipas.jpg|Mexican box turtle (Terrapene mexicana) in the field in southern Tamaulipas, Mexico ;Bibliography *Rhodin, Anders G.J.; van Dijk, Peter Paul; Inverson, John B.; Shaffer, H.
