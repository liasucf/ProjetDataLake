    "text": "Paige Marie Renkoski (born February 2, 1960) is a woman from Okemos, Michigan, who disappeared on May 24, 1990. She was last seen talking to a man on the shoulder of Interstate 96 near Fowlerville, Michigan. Her disappearance is one of Michigan's longest running cold cases. ==Disappearance== At around 11:30 a.m. on May 24, 1990, Paige Renkoski drove her mother to Detroit Metropolitan Airport and then visited a friend in Canton, Michigan. She was seen between 2:30 p.m. and 2:45 p.m. at a store that has since closed down, west of Interstate 275 in Canton, where she bought a beer that was later found in her car. The store clerk remembered seeing Renkoski because she was wearing \"distinctive multi-colored, loose-fitting, flower-patterned pants and a distinctive necklace\". Renkoski was last seen on the shoulder of Interstate 96 near Fowlerville, talking to a man who was standing next to a maroon-colored minivan. Hours later, the 1986 Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais she had been driving was found still idling, with her shoes and purse inside. Many people claimed to have seen Renkoski driving west on I-96. One was a woman who said she might have seen her at a rest-stop kiosk. Others include two long-haul truck drivers who reported seeing an attractive blonde matching Renkoski's description and may have passed her when she was driving her vehicle on I-96. Renkoski was last seen wearing a white silk shirt, with a long beaded necklace, and silk patterned slacks. In his book Death of a Model, which is about the death of a different young woman, investigative journalist and true crime author Clifford L. Linedecker discusses Renkoski's \"baffling\" disappearance, describing her as a \"statuesque five foot seven inch blue-eyed blond with a model's figure.\" ==Investigation== Investigators found Renkoski's Oldsmobile, but it was not processed as a crime scene because at the time it was considered by the responding officer to be an abandoned vehicle. The car was undamaged and the door was unlocked. The vehicle was later towed. Someone had reported seeing Renkoski near her car at about 3:00pm, and officers had not responded to the scene until after 6:00pm. They then had learned that Renkoski was in fact missing and the car was not abandoned. When examining the vehicle, police found several fingerprints and palm prints, but a match has yet to be identified on any law enforcement databases. In May 2011, authorities began searching a pond in Handy Township using ground-penetrating radar. A woman reported seeing a pair of cement-covered boots there around the time of Renkoski's disappearance. In November 2011, the FBI, state and local police began a dig operation in Conway Township in search of Renkoski's remains. Cadaver dogs identified the site a week before the dig started. Investigators went to the property after reviewing a 1999 case file, which included a \"hand drawn map indicating Renkoski's remains were buried there\". ==Aftermath== The police have ruled the case a homicide, even though her body has never been located and no one has been charged in her disappearance or death. Michigan Crime Stoppers is offering a cash reward of up to $2,500 for any information about Renkoski. On June 27, 1990, workers began erecting billboards featuring Renkoski along Interstate 96; a total of 25 billboard ads were planned. In May 2013, authorities announced that they would be erecting billboards featuring Renkoski and two other missing women. On February 2, 2018, a dual memorial service was held for Renkoski and her mother, who died in December 2017. ==See also== *List of people who disappeared ==References== ==External links== *Paige Marie Renkoski at The Charley Project. * Category:1990 in Michigan Category:1990s missing person cases Category:Crimes in Michigan Category:History of Michigan Category:Missing person cases in Michigan ",
