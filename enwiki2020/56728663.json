    "text": "The Trimble House is a Queen Anne home built in 1905 at 725 North Fourth Street in Wickliffe, Kentucky, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. The Kentucky Heritage Council released: > As with any house, many influences impacted the Trimble House: the > architects, a Kentucky owner, and the culture along the banks of the > Mississippi River. The home was constructed by a town banker, Isaac N. > Trimble, who originally resided in a Victorian-era home before he and his > neighbors were displaced by two railroads \u2013 the Gulf, Mobile, and Ohio and > the Illinois Central. Trimble relocated to Dennett Heights, a prominent high > spot in town, and in 1905 built one of the town\u2019s first brick houses > featuring a simply detailed yet complex Queen Anne-style structure. The > home\u2019s architects were J.B. Legg and C.S. Holloway of St. Louis, who also > designed the Ballard County Courthouse and Methodist Episcopal Church. > Current owners Martha and Jim Wilson have lived in the house since 1954 and > recently completed an extensive remodeling. ==References== Small text ==External links== * Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Kentucky Category:Queen Anne architecture in Kentucky Category:Houses completed in 1905 Category:Ballard County, Kentucky Category:1905 establishments in Kentucky ",
