It got its nickname from the resemblance to a Thermos flask. ==Development== With the end of the Battle of France and the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from the port of Dunkirk between 26 May and 4 June 1940, a German invasion of Great Britain seemed likely.Mackenzie, p. 20 The British Army was not well-equipped to defend the country in such an event; in the weeks after the Dunkirk evacuation it could only field twenty-seven divisions.Lampe, p. 3 The Army was particularly short of anti-tank guns, 840 of which had been left behind in France leaving only 167 available in Britain; ammunition was so scarce for the remaining guns that regulations forbade any being used for training purposes. As a result of these shortcomings, new anti-tank weapons had to be developed to equip the British Army and the Home Guard with the means to repel German armoured vehicles.Hogg, pp. 237\u2013239 Many of these were anti-tank hand grenades, large numbers of which could be built in a very short space of time and for a low cost. They included the grenade, hand, anti-tank No. 74, also known as the \"sticky bomb\", which was coated with a strong adhesive and stuck to a vehicle, and the No. 76 special incendiary grenade, essentially a simple white phosphorus incendiary contained in a breakable glass container, like a more sophisticated variation of the Molotov cocktail (which simply uses a flammable liquid such as gasoline and a burning rag as a \"fuse\").Hogg, pp. 239\u2013240 Ian Hogg states that the simplest of these grenades was the No. 73 grenade. ==Design== The No. 73 grenade had a roughly cylindrical shape and plastic screw-on cap,Rottman, World War II Infantry Assault Tactics, p. 25 similar to that of a Thermos flask, from which the \"Thermos bomb\" nickname was derived.Longmate, p. 77 It was approximately in diameter and in length,Rottman, World War II Infantry Assault Tactics, p. 62 and weighed . Its explosive content consisted of of polar ammonal gelatine dynamite or nitrogelatine \u2013 both of which were highly flammable and could be detonated by the impact of small-arms fire. When thrown at a tank or other vehicle, a weighted tape held in the users hand unravelled and pulled free a safety pin, which was attached to a Type 247 \"all-ways\" fuze (the same type used in the Gammon bomb and No. 69 grenade); this armed and then detonated the grenade.Bull, p. 30 Its weight meant that it could only be thrown short distances, limiting its range to between , and its detonation could injure the user if they did not find cover before it detonated. It was able to penetrate of armour,Rottman, World War II Infantry Anti-Tank Tactics, p. 62 and \"damage severely any light tank.\" It was best used against the tracks of a tank, which it could easily blow off and force its crew to waste time by stopping and repairing it.Bull, pp. 30\u201331 ==Operational history== The No. 73 grenade was first issued in the last months of 1940, but it was rarely used as an anti- tank grenade; instead the fuze was usually removed and it was used as a demolition charge. It was withdrawn from service within a year, and reissued again in 1943 for the express purpose of being used for demolition work. On 27 May 1942, a modified version of the grenade was used in the assassination of SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Reinhard Heydrich, when paratrooper Jan Kubi\u0161 threw it at Heydrich's car in Prague. The bomb used for this purpose had been shortened.\u0160olc, Ji\u0159\u00ed: Nikdo n\u00e1s nezastav\u00ed.
