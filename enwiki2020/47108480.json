    "text": "Abdul Raziq Achakzai (; ) (1979 \u2013 October 18, 2018) was a warlord and a police chief in the Afghan National Police. His father and uncle were killed by the Taliban in 1994. Raziq started fighting against the Taliban in 2001, eventually overthrowing them in the Kandahar area. He was considered to be one of the most powerful security officials in Afghanistan for the last few years of his life. After surviving several assassination attempts over the years by the Taliban, Raziq was killed in an insider attack by a bodyguard of the provincial governor, who opened fire on him and other security officials after a meeting with the U.S. Army General Scott Miller at the governor's compound in Kandahar. Raziq was succeeded by his brother, Tadeen Khan, who has no military related experience. Tadeen's nomination was a result of heavy pressure from powerful tribal elders who pressured the Afghan government to overlook his lack of experience and training. ==Personal life== Abdul Raziq Achakzai was born in 1979 in the town of Spin Boldak, Kandahar Province, where he was raised. He was a member of the Adozai Achakzai tribe of the Pashtuns. He and his family left Afghanistan after the Taliban took control of Afghanistan. Raziq's prominent uncle and father were killed by the Taliban in 1994, as they rose to power in Kandahar. He and his family returned after the U.S-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. Raziq was illiterate and had three wives. Abdul Raziq Achakzai is thought to have received annual kickbacks from customs revenues exacted at border crossings. He became extremely wealthy as a result of his control over the province and a major border thoroughfare. He also spent time in Dubai and had been heavily involved in horse trading. Abdul Raziq also has businesses abroad. ==Military career== In November 2001, Raziq joined anti-Taliban forces, under Fayda Mohammad and Gul Agha Sherzai, which overthrew the Taliban in Kandahar, southern Afghanistan. Although he was unknown in 2001, he nevertheless rose to command the Afghan Border Police on Afghanistan's border between Kandahar and Pakistan's Balochistan Province. ==Human rights abuses== Abdul Raziq Achakzai was alleged to have committed numerous human right violations including extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances and torture in the Kandahar province. In 2017, the United Nations committee on torture wanted Abdul Raziq to be prosecuted for allegations of torture and enforced disappearances. The committee also stated that Abdul Raziq was 'operating secret detentions centers' where people were being tortured. Abdul Raziq denied all the allegations made against him by the U.N. committee. Apart from Human right organizations and United Nation, locals of Kandahar also accused him of being involved in human right violations. Some Tribal elders and legislators from the province expressed relief over his death. One legislator said that the Kandahar province became less violent after his death. Former president of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai and other powerful allies sheltered Abdul Raziq from being prosecuted for many years. In 2007, Hamid Karzai blocked western efforts to have Abdul Raziq fired over human rights concerns. In August 2011, United States military banned the transfer of detainees to Afghan authorities in Kandahar. U.S. military stated that they are investigating reports regarding abuse of prisoners by provincial police chief as they have received \"credible allegations\" that detainees are being mistreated while in the custody of Abdul Raziq Achakzai. U.S. military spokesman, Col. Gary Kolb, said that U.S. forces won't be handing over detainees to Afghan officials until they are sure that there are no issues. ==Drug smuggling and corruption== Abdul Raziq was also accused of being involved in drug smuggling and corruption cases. US Military officials have acknowledged in front of the members of Congress that Raziq had made millions by collecting major cuts from all the trucks that pass through Spin Boldak crossing. Similarly Canadian Brig.Gen. Jonathan Vance, former commander of NATO-led forces, acknowledged that Abdul Raziq was directly involved in drug smuggling. Matthieu Aikins, in his investigative story in Harper's Magazine, stated that Abdul Raziq made $5 to $6 Million dollars every month through drug smuggling. In 2010, the head of Afghan customs revenue, Bismullah Kammawie, said that every year Afghan government is receiving only a 'fifth of what the government should collect' in customs revenue from the Spin Boldak crossing in Kandahar province. In 2015, an Afghan newspaper, Khaama Press, also reported that the Afghan government was only receiving 1/5th what it should be receiving from the customs border which was under the control of Abdul Raziq. Raziq maintained full control of Spin Boldak crossing until his death. ==References== Category:1979 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Afghan military personnel Category:People from Kandahar Province Category:Pashtun people Category:Assassinated Afghan people ",
