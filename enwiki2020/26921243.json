It was noted that the border remained closed, except to humanitarian relief and the efforts of Serbia and Montenegro in this regard. There was greater co- operation between Serbia and Montenegro and the Mission of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia. Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the international sanctions placed on Serbia and Montenegro were suspended until 18 March 1996. Restrictions and arrangements in resolutions 943 and 988 would continue to apply. The situation would remain constantly under review by the Security Council. ==See also== * Bosnian War * Breakup of Yugoslavia * Croatian War of Independence * List of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1001 to 1100 (1995\u20131997) * Yugoslav Wars ==References== ==External links== * *Text of the Resolution at undocs.org 1015 1015 Category:1995 in Yugoslavia Category:1995 in Bosnia and Herzegovina 1015 Category:September 1995 events ",
