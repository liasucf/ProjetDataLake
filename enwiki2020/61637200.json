William was baptised in King's Stanley, Gloucestershire on 25 August 1833. He was the son of a millwright. His first marriage was to Joyce Webb in 1858 and his initial career was as a teacher in Cainscross, Gloucestershire. Joyce bore William three sons before dying, and WIlliam remarried Mary Ann Aga in 1865. In 1868 he bought the photographic business of William Cobb of Ipswich and the family settled in London Road, Ipswich. Cobb had been the photographic assistant to Richard Dykes Alexander, the prominent banker and pioneer photographer who had lived across the road from Cobb at Alexander House until his death in 1865. Vick described himself as a \"photographic artist\" in the 1871 and 1881 censuses, but subsequently simply used the term \"photographer\". ==Gallery== Vick (1890) Curson Lodge.jpg|Curson Lodge1890 W.
