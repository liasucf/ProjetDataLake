    "text": "The cobbled surface of the Paddestraat in Zottegem. The Paddestraat (English: Toad Street) is a 2.3 km long cobbled road in the municipality of Zottegem, in East Flanders, Belgium. The road is a regular location of the springtime cycling classics in Flanders. In 1995, the cobbled road of the Paddestraat was classified as a protected monument by the Flemish government. ==Characteristics== The road is situated entirely in Zottegem. The cobbled part starts at the bridge over the Zwalm, a small river at 18 m altitude, on the border between Zwalm and Zottegem. It runs northeasterly towards the Roman Square in Velzeke, a part of Zottegem, at 50 m altitude. Most altitude gain happens in the first 800 m, before flattening out in the latter 1.500 m, totalling ca. 2.350 m of cobbled surface. The road dates back to Roman times, when it was a part of the historic road from Boulogne-sur-Mer to Cologne. An archeological museum, the provincial archeological centre Velzeke (AVE), is situated at the northeasterly entrance of the Paddestraat. Some important archeological findings from Gallo-Roman culture, including the bronze Venus of Velzeke, were made at the site. The Dutch name of the road (English: Toad Street) is taken from the common toad, which are found in large number at the site near the river during mating season. ==Cycling== The site is best known from cycling, as it is a regular feature in the Tour of Flanders. The Paddestraat was first included in the course in 1973, and has been a fixed location in the both the men's and women's race, except for the 1988 event, when the road was under repair. The Paddestraat also features occasionally in Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Dwars door Vlaanderen and the Tour of Belgium, as well as many junior and U-23 events. ==Gallery== File:Ronde van Vlaanderenroute 03.jpg File:Gesloten hoeve, Paddestraat, Velzeke-Ruddershove 01.jpg File:Hof de Moriaan Zottegem 05.jpg File:Paddestraat 01.jpg ==References== Category:Cobbled streets Category:Tour of Flanders Category:Mountains and hills of East Flanders ",
