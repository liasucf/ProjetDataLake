Later in mid-2011, it was formed in the heart of the United Arab Emirates to support agencies and governments in the decision- making phase. The centre rarely publishes its researches due to confidentiality reasons. However, there are many blogs and other sister- centers through which it releases publications, such as the Middle East Briefing, Ixyria and many others.http://www.orientresearchcentre.com/about- orc/ The Orient Research Centre's slogan is THINK ARABIC, and in other words those who conduct researches for ORC are Arabs and they give their point of view of what's happening around the world as Arabs.https://www.facebook.com/pages/ORC-Orient-Research- Centre/353424114855861 ORC holds from five to eight closed seminars per year in which the subject varies depending on the needs of the political momentum.
