It consists of the ruins of a square brick tower facing east and is preceded by a laterite terrace. This is all that remains of this temple which must be one of many that originally surrounded the Bakheng. A sacred treasure consisting of five gold leaves arranged in a quincunx, the central leaf of which carried the image of Nandi, was found here.Ancient Angkor guide book by Michael Freeman and Claude Jacques, p.73, published in 2003 == See also == *Baksei Chamkrong *Phnom Bakheng *Prasat Bei == References == Category:Angkorian sites in Siem Reap Province ",
