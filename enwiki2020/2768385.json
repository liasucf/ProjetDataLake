It is double track for about until it reaches the approach to Belmont where it becomes single track. The line continues from Belmont through Banstead and terminates at Epsom Downs in Surrey. The \"Downs\" referred to in the name are part of the North Downs. ==History== The line was proposed in 1863 by the Banstead and Epsom Downs Railway, which became incorporated into the London Brighton and South Coast Railway in July 1864. It was opened for traffic on 22 May 1865. ==Infrastructure== The line was electrified at 660 V using the third rail system in 1928, with electric services starting on 17 June. The line was reduced to single track in 1982 when all signalling was controlled from Victoria Signalling Centre. The line was shortened by when a new station was built at Epsom Downs. This opened on 13 December 1989. ==Services== There are four stops on the line: *Sutton - zone 5 *Belmont - zone 5 *Banstead - zone 6 *Epsom Downs - zone 6 All services on the line are currently operated by Southern, and form part of the Sutton & Mole Valley Line services.
