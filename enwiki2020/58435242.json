    "text": "Alpine valley of the Pi\u0161nica The Pi\u0161nica River forms at the confluence of the Velika Pi\u0161nica and Mala Pi\u0161nica streams in the Julian Alps in the Kranjska Gora region of northwest Slovenia. The Pi\u0161nica joins the Sava Dolinka and runs through the central area of the Triglav National Park. At the confluence lies a small, natural canyon and an hydroelectric power plant. Because the source is glacial, the river's temperature remains cold (5-10\u00b0C) in the summer. Category:Rivers of Slovenia ",
