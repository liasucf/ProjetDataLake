A hustle player, he does the little things that help his team with a physical and high- energy style. In attack, he starts from the perimeter, working off the dribble or moving without the ball to set up a scoring opportunity. He is deceptively fast and can burst past defenders, using shot fakes and step throughs on the way, though he can lose control of his run and the ball or try low percentage shots. His size and strength allow him to muscle his way to the hoop, shielding the ball with ease, he can finish even through contact. With a good mid-range jump shot, he's hard to guard due to his size, adding his play in the paint it makes him an all-around scoring threat when in form. He shines more in defense, where his hustle play and non-stop effort allow him to make an impact, most notably in rebounding on a statistical front. His physical attributes allow him to guard anyone, from point guard to power forward, though he has been noted to struggle against perimeter players. Never afraid to mix it up he uses his athleticism to keep his man off-balance. Observers feel that for him to play in the NBA, as a 3, he needs to consistently and confidently make shots from the three point line, getting his shot off quicker and smoother. Finishing college at 24, he was not foreseen at the time to change his playing style radically or develop exponentially, though his work ethic was expected to ensure a long, sustained career. ==Personal life== The son of Gordon and Marva James, Delroy has seven siblings, including three sisters and four brothers. Three of his older brothers played basketball at a professional or collegiate level: :-Shawn James played with Serie A club EA7 Emporio Armani Milano. :-Gordon has played professionally in Japan and Latin America. :-Lex played for St. Francis without going professional. His parents moved to the United States from Guyana in 1990 along with four children. They left Delroy with two siblings whilst they made arrangements for them to join them, something that proved possible about 3 years later. Arriving in Brooklyn, New York aged 7, he struggled to adapt to a completely different environment. Though he skipped classes, he also avoided getting involved in the gangs that were rife in his neighbourghood. He has a son, Jaylen, he cites fatherhood as one of his greatest accomplishments, another is graduating and a declared future goal of his would be to use his sociology degree to become a guidance counselor or mentor to children. ==Career statistics== |- | align=center | 2015-16 | align=left | Enisey Krasnoyarsk | align=center | VTB United | 30 || 27.6 || .436 || .341 || .791 || 6.5 || 2.8 || 1.1 || .9 || 12.5 |- | align=center | 2016-17 | align=left | Best Balikesir | align=center | TBL | 16 || 32.1 || .497 || .426 || .776 || 5.7 || 2.4 || 1.3 || .9 || 15.8 |- | align=center | 2016-17 | align=left | Grissin Bon Reggio Emilia | align=center | LBA | 15 || 18.1 || .337 || .188 || .571 || 3.5 || 1.5 || .9 || .9 || 5.1 |- | align=center | 2017\u201318 | align=left | A.E.K. | align=center | GBL | 25 || 20.5 || .404 || .227 || .691 || 3.5 || 1.7 || 1.0 || .4 || 7.1 |- | align=center | 2017-18 | align=left | A.E.K. | align=center | BCL | 20 || 22.0 || .453 || .312 || .700 || 4.4 || 1.6 || 1.1 || .8 || 8.7 |- | align=center | 2018-19 | align=left | A.E.K. | align=center | GBL | 27 || 20.0 || .456 || .184 || .853 || 3.3 || 1.5 || .6 || .6 || 7.0 |- | align=center | 2018-19 | align=left | A.E.K. | align=center | BCL | 9 || 17.3 || .455 || .300 || .800 || 3.6 || 1.8 || 1.0 || 1.1 || 5.7 |- | align=center | 2018-19 | align=left | Royal Hali Gaziantep | align=center | T-BSL | 11 || 24.8 || .364 || .333 || .708 || 4.4 || 1.1 || .6 || .5 || 9.1 |- | align=center | 2018-19 | align=left | Meralco Bolts | align=center | PBA | 3 || 41.2 || .485 || .409 || .650 || 8.7 || 6.7 || 1.7 || 2.0 || 28.7 |- |-class=sortbottom | align=\"center\" colspan=2 | Career | All Leagues | 169 || 22.0 || .437 || .310 || .736 || 4.3 || 1.8 || .9 || .7 || 8.9 ==References== ==External links== *RealGM.com Profile *Eurobasket.com Profile *Greek Basket League Profile *Italian League Profile *Turkish BSL Profile Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:AEK B.C. players Category:American expatriate basketball people in Greece Category:American expatriate basketball people in Israel Category:American expatriate basketball people in Italy Category:American expatriate basketball people in the Philippines Category:American expatriate basketball people in South Korea Category:American men's basketball players Category:American people of Guyanese descent Category:Basket Ferentino players Category:Basketball players from New York (state) Category:Best Bal\u0131kesir B.K. players Category:BC Enisey players Category:Bnei HaSharon players Category:Gaziantep Basketbol players Category:Guyanese men's basketball players Category:Israeli Basketball Premier League players Category:Lega Basket Serie A players Category:Meralco Bolts players Category:New Basket Brindisi players Category:Pallacanestro Reggiana players Category:Philippine Basketball Association imports Category:Power forwards (basketball) Category:Rhode Island Rams men's basketball players Category:Seoul Samsung Thunders players Category:Sportspeople from Brooklyn Category:Tulsa 66ers players ",
