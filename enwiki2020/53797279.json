He completed a bachelor's degree in business administration from Pacific Western University in the United States. ==Political career== In his early political career, Chen served as an aid to Li Yuan-tsu. He was first elected to the Legislative Yuan in 1998 and reelected in 2001. Despite his Kuomintang membership, Chen was active in the Alliance for Independent Lawmakers. He was named a member of a new legislative coalition in 2001. However, group leader Lo Fu-chu postponed its formation in July. In June 2002, Chen defied the Kuomintang caucus by submitting his vote on a group of government appointees. For ignoring the Pan-Blue Coalition's attempt to boycott the proceedings, Chen was expelled from the KMT. In the 2004 legislative elections, Chen ran under the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union, winning a third term. He represented the NPSU in the 2008 elections, but finished second to Chen Hsiu-ching. By 2011, Chen had joined the Democratic Progressive Party and registered for the 2012 legislative elections. He did not win a seat, but the next year he was considered a potential DPP candidate for the Changhua County magistracy, a post eventually won by fellow DPP member Wei Ming-ku. Chen was subsequently named the DPP director for Changhua County. ==Political stances== Chen believes the Republic of China and Taiwan to be equivalent entities. ==References== Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Changhua County Members of the Legislative Yuan Category:Members of the 4th Legislative Yuan Category:Members of the 5th Legislative Yuan Category:Members of the 6th Legislative Yuan Category:Kuomintang Members of the Legislative Yuan in Taiwan Category:Expelled members of the Kuomintang Category:Non-Partisan Solidarity Union Members of the Legislative Yuan Category:Democratic Progressive Party (Taiwan) politicians Category:National Chung Hsing University alumni Category:National Chengchi University alumni ",
