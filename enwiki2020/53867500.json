    "text": "Gems is a British television soap opera produced for the ITV network by Thames Television. Three seasons of the programme were transmitted between 1985 and 1988. Devised by Tessa Diamond, who had previously created ITV's first television soap, Emergency Ward 10, Gems was the name of a fictional fashion design company based in Covent Garden and managed by the Stone brothers, Alan and Stephen, whose differences in outlook and temperament meant that the business was often in choppy waters. The professional problems and personal lives of the employees of the company were the focus of the soap's storylines. Gems was one of a series of ITV soap operas transmitted in afternoon slots during the 1980s produced by various ITV regional companies. The other British ITV \"daytime\" soaps included: Together (Southern), For Maddie with Love (ATV), Taff Acre (HTV), Miracles Take Longer (Thames) and Take the High Road (Scottish). Gems was screened thrice weekly during its initial run in 1985, followed by a twice-weekly season in 1986 and returned to a thrice-weekly slot for its third and final run in 1988. The series directors included: Mervyn Cumming (Series 1-2), Christopher Baker (Series 1-2), Stuart Orme (Series 1), Keith Washington (Series 1), Brian Lighthill (Series 3) and Jane Howell (Series 3).
