An exhaustive ballot method was used, so that the support of 29 of the 56 MPs were required to elect the leader. Bridges was elected party leader after two rounds of voting. Bennett and Collins ran for the deputy leadership, and Bennett was re-elected to the position. ==Outcomes== On 6 March Joyce announced his retirement from politics following speculation he would lose the finance portfolio. Joyce wouldn't confirm or deny this but said Bridges offered him a \"high-ranking\" portfolio. On 11 March Bridges announced his shadow cabinet which saw Adams, Collins and Mitchell receive promotions; ranked 3rd, 4th and 7th respectively. Two weeks later, former leadership contender Jonathan Coleman resigned from Parliament; Adams announced her own upcoming retirement in early 2019. Bridges held the leadership for two years, before being successfully challenged for the role by Todd Muller. ==See also== * 2018 Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand female co-leadership election * 52nd New Zealand Parliament ==References== Category:2018 elections in New Zealand 2018 Category:February 2018 events in New Zealand ",
