The school had been founded in 1863 as the Wesleyan Collegiate Institute with the Rev. James Egan Moulton as Headmaster awaiting the arrival of Thomas Johnston in that role. Johnston then developed a sound academic program at Silverwater but Fletcher was keen to further this and so Metcalfe with his BA, a notable achievement in the mid-1860s, was deemed a worthy successor. At this time Metcalfe was seen as a \"finished classical scholar with an intense appreciation of the great Greek and Latin writers\". In 1868 he was awarded a Master of Arts from the University of Sydney.Alumni Sidneienses Retrieved 14 April 2017. At Newington, accommodation and catering were managed by Miss Gilligan.
