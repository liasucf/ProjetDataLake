    "text": "Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties () is the designation under which the UNESCO has included several tombs and burial complexes into the list of World Heritage Sites (WHS). These tombs date from the Ming and Qing dynasties of China. Tombs were included in the list in 2000, 2003 and 2004. Three Imperial tombs in Liaoning Province, all built in the 17th century, were added in 2004: the Yongling tomb, the Fuling tomb and the Zhaoling tomb were constructed for the founding emperors of the Qing dynasty and their ancestors. These tombs feature rich decoration of stone statues and carvings and tiles with dragon motifs, illustrating the development of the funerary architecture of the Qing dynasty. The three tomb complexes, and their numerous edifices, combine traditions inherited from previous dynasties and new features of Manchu culture. ==Properties included in the World Heritage Site== WHS No. 1004ter includes the following tombs or tomb groups: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Serial ID No.!!Tomb!!Province!!Location!!Coordinates!!Area (m\u00b2)!!Buffer (m\u00b2)!!
