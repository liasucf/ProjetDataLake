It operates scheduled domestic passenger services and regional international services. == History == The airline was established and started operating in 1980. The airline's historic links go back to 1958 to the airline Air Taxi Co., which was rebranded as Pars Air in the 1970s and later Iran Aseman Airlines. In March 2007, it was owned by Iranian Civil Pension Fund Investment Company and had 298 employees. It has since been privatized. In July 2016, the CEO of the airline was issued an arrest warrant because of an alleged sum of approximately $37 million in public debts to Iran Airports & Air Navigation Company.http://www.yjc.ir/fa/news/5663910/\u062d\u06a9\u0645-\u062c\u0644\u0628-\u0645\u062f\u06cc\u0631\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0644- \u0634\u0631\u06a9\u062a-\u0647\u0648\u0627\u067e\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u06cc-\u0622\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0646-\u0635\u0627\u062f\u0631-\u0634\u062f In February 2017, it emerged that Aseman Airlines was in talks with an Irish firm to lease seven Airbus A320neos.
