His selection for the final came about because the Uruguayans disputed the selection of Dutch referee Johannes Mutters after a acrimonious semi final victory over the Dutch. As a result Slawick's name was drawn out of a hat.https://www.fifa.com/en/comp/olympicsmen/0,3664,116-OLY-1924,00.html Slawick refereed four games in the Olympics between 1924 and 1928.Reyes, Macario. \"Football Tournament 1924 Olympiad\".
