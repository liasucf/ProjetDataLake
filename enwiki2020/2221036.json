    "text": "Georgios Tsitas (1872 - 1940s) was a Greek wrestler. He competed at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens. In the first round of the wrestling competition, held in a roughly Greco-Roman format, Tsitas had a bye to guarantee a top three finish before he even had a match. The semifinal pitted Tsitas against fellow Greek Stephanos Christopoulos. Tsitas won the match by throwing Christopoulos. In the final, Tsitas wrestled with Carl Schuhmann of Germany, an exceptional gymnast, for 40 minutes before the match was postponed due to darkness. Tsitas did not last long the following day, being defeated to finish in second place. ==References== * Category:1872 births Category:1940s deaths Category:Greek male sport wrestlers Category:Olympic wrestlers of Greece Category:Olympic silver medalists for Greece Category:Olympic medalists in wrestling Category:Wrestlers at the 1896 Summer Olympics Category:19th-century sportsmen Category:Medalists at the 1896 Summer Olympics ",
