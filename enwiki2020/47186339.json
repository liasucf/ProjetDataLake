The competition replaced the NSW Super League as the top-tier competition in New South Wales. The season moved away from a winter league to a summer league to align with the then premier national competition, the National Soccer League. The second-tier competition became the NSW Winter Super League. The competition began on Friday, 3 November 2000 at St George Stadium for the Round 1 fixture between St George Saints and Canterbury- Marrickville. The competition concluded with the Grand Final being played on Sunday, 8 April 2001 at Marconi Stadium, with Bonnyrigg White Eagles FC taking out the title by defeating Premiers Blacktown City FC 3\u20131. ==Clubs== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:100%;\" !
