She is remembered for starting the Portuguese tradition of bringing gifts of clothes, toys and sweets to children in hospital at Christmas. She fought successfully to have conditions for female prisoners significantly improved. In addition to her award-winning poetry, Lutgarda de Caires published articles in the press calling for equal opportunities for women and improvements to their property rights. ==Biography== Born in Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio in 1873, Lutgarda Guimar\u00e3es was the daughter of Mar\u00eda Teresa de Barros y Jos\u00e9 Rodrigues Guimar\u00e3es. After her mother died when she was still a small child, she and her brother were lovingly cared for by her father who introduced them to the harp, violin and sitar. While still young, Guimar\u00e3es left the Algarve and moved to Lisbon where she met and later married Jo\u00e3o de Caires, a lawyer from Madeira. He founded the Sociedade de Propaganda de Portugal which met regularly in their home, bringing together guests interested in discussing literature. Guimar\u00e3es also took part in the meetings but was initially saddened by the death of her infant daughter. It was her daughter's death that encouraged her to take clothes, toys and sweets to the children in the Hospital da Estef\u00e2nia. From 1905, she began to contribute articles on social issues to newspapers and journals. As for her poetry, her first work was Glic\u00ednias (1910). Other popular works were Papoilas (1912) and A Dan\u00e7a do Destino, contos e narrativas (1913). In 1923, her sonnet Florinha da Rua won the first prize in the Hispano-Portuguese Floral Games in Ceuta. In 1911, the Ministry of Justice invited her to undertake a study of the conditions in which prisoners lived, especially women. As a result of her criticisms, improvements followed. In June 1913, she, Ana Augusta de Castilho, Beatriz Pinheiro, Joana de Almeida Nogueira and Maria Veleda were part of the Portuguese delegation at the Seventh Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance in Budapest. Lutgarda Guimar\u00e3es de Caires died in Lisbon in 1935. ==References== Category:1873 births Category:1935 deaths Category:People from Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio Category:Portuguese feminists Category:Portuguese women's rights activists Category:Portuguese philanthropists Category:20th-century Portuguese poets Category:Portuguese women writers Category:Order of Saint James of the Sword ",
