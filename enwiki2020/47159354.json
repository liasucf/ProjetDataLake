    "text": "Robert Half International, or commonly referred as, Robert Half, is a global human resource consulting firm based in Menlo Park, California founded in 1948. It is a member of the S&P; 500, and is credited as being the world's first and largest accounting and finance staffing firm, with over 345 locations worldwide. Robert Half has a variety of divisions. The Company operates through three segments: temporary and consultant staffing, permanent placement staffing, and risk consulting and internal audit services. Through its Accountemps, Robert Half Finance & Accounting, Robert Half Management Resources divisions, it provides temporary, full-time and project professionals in the fields of accounting and finance. Other divisions include Robert Half Technology, providing software, application, IT infrastructure and operations professionals, OfficeTeam, which specializes in administrative and customer service staffing, The Creative Group, that focuses on design, artistic, and creative talent, and Robert Half Legal that offer flexible and direct-hire staffing for legal professionals. In 2002, Protiviti Inc. was founded as a subsidiary of Robert Half, which provides internal audit, financial, operations, technology, governance, and risk consulting services. Robert Half is listed by Fortune magazine as among the \"World's Most Admired Companies\" in the temporary-help industry for 21 years consecutively (as of 2019) since it first made the list in 1998. ==History== The company's founding was in 1948, in New York City, with its original name being variously reported as being Robert Half Inc., Robert Half Finance & Accounting, and Robert Half Personnel Agency. The founding, in any case, is reported to have been of two separate business entities, the Robert Half (RH) portion as \"an employment agency for accountants,\" and the Accountemps portion \"to supply accountants and other financial professionals\u2026 on a temporary basis.\" Founder Robert Half had previously managed the hiring of accounting staff for a sizeable textile manufacturing concern, and saw an opportunity as no placement agency had been focusing on this sector of the market. In the mid- to late-1980s, Robert Half (RH) altered its prior focus\u2014which had been like that of the field in general\u2014from relatively undifferentiated temporary clerical and light industry staffing, to providing temporary workers at higher skill levels via new \"professional staffing divisions\". Having grown to over 150 locations in the United States and launched an aggressive campaign to re-purchase many of the separate franchises, the firm went public in 1987, then expanded its operations into Europe in 1993. This information is derived from the following source: Note, this compilation reports, to a significant degree, information self-reported by the company, and so constitutes information not strictly third-party in nature. In addition to their Accountemps brand, the firm expanded to include specialty groups focusing on technology, legal and creative services personnel. Inroads into the legal sector began with the company's 1991 acquisition of \"The Affiliates, a firm in Southern California that placed temporary and permanent paralegal, legal administrative, and other legal support personnel,\" with it being renamed as Robert Half Legal. Robert Half went on to establish itself as a key information provider for government agencies and others seeking statistics and trends regarding employment, with its market-specific salary guides being used as a resource by the U.S Department of Labor in the preparation of their own forecasts. In addition to their main staffing line of business, RH also provides independent risk consulting, internal audit and information technology consulting services via its Protiviti subsidiary, which was founded in 2002 with the acquisition of former employees of Arthur Andersen. Since then, the group has grown from 700 to over 2,900 staff, and continues to be led by Andersen alumni. In 2003, the company was finally able to buy back the last of the few remaining independent franchise operations. In 2006, RH (through subsidiary Proviti Inc.) acquired the assets of PG Lewis & Associates, a leading national provider of Data Forensics and Cyber Security services founded in 2003 by serial technology entrepreneur, Paul G. Lewis. Financial terms were not disclosed. ==Published works== Founder Robert Half's tradition of authoring books on the industry\u2014such as Making It Big in Data Processing and How to Get a Better Job in This Crazy World\u2014was continued by the CEO of this date, Harold M. \"Max\" Messmer, in the form of works like Job Hunting for Dummies. ==See also== * Protiviti * Human resource consulting * Arthur Andersen ==References== ==Further reading== ===Verified sources=== * AT Staff, \"Staffing Firm Founder Robert Half Dead at 82,\" Accounting Today, September 24, 2001, p. 56\\. * Brandstrader, J.R., \"It's an Ill Wind,\" Barron's, March 25, 1996, p. 18\\. * Byrnes, Nanette, et al., \"The Good CEO,\" Businessweek, September 23, 2002. * Caldwell, Douglas E., \"The New Economy's Gold Digger,\" Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal, March 16, 2001, p. 38\\. * Desloge, Rick, \"Robert Half, Kelly Services Share in Temp Firm Growth,\" St. Louis Business Journal, December 1, 1997, p. 24\\. * Fleming, Eric C., \"Job-Recruiter Blues: Will Paltry Demand Drain Robert Half Shares?,\" Barron's, November 11, 2002, p.
