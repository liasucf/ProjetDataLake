    "text": "Entrance The Angladon Museum - Jacques Doucet (French - Mus\u00e9e Angladon - Collection Jacques Doucet) is a museum at 5 rue Laboureur in Avignon. It is based in the h\u00f4tel de Massilian, a former h\u00f4tel particulier built in the 18th century. The museum was established in 1996 according to the wishes of Jean and Paulette Angladon-Dubrujeaud, heirs to the widow of the Parisian couturier Jacques Doucet (1853-1929). Its collections includes artworks from the 18th to 20th century. == History == Jacques Doucet set up one of the first haute- couture fashion houses in Paris, based at rue de la Paix from 1895 to 1927 rue de la Paix. With the wealth he gained from this ventured he collected drawings, paintings, furniture and objets d'art from the 18th century to the present-day. He was also an active patron of the arts, financially supporting writers such as Louis Aragon, Andr\u00e9 Breton, Robert Desnos, Max Jacob, Andr\u00e9 Suar\u00e8s, Antonin Artaud, Blaise Cendrars and Pierre Reverdy and donating two whole libraries to the Universit\u00e9 de Paris, made up of several thousands of books and documents and now forming the Biblioth\u00e8que d'art et d'arch\u00e9ologie Jacques Doucet (now the library of the INHA) and the Biblioth\u00e8que litt\u00e9raire Jacques Doucet respectively. Doucet died in 1929 and twenty-nine years later his widow made Jean Dubrujeaud her heir. He in turn left the Doucet fortune and collection to his son Jean Angladon-Dubrujeaud, a painter and engraver living in Avignon and going by the name Jean Angladon (1906-1979). His wife Paulette (1905-1988) was also an artist, going by the name Paulette Martin. Together the couple donated some works from the collection to museums such as the Louvre, sold others but also acquired others to replace them. They had no children and decided to leave their collection - via the Fondation de France - to the Fondation Angladon-Dubrujeaud. This foundation was established in Avignon in 1993 and charged with setting up an art gallery, which it opened on 15 November 1993 and still runs. == H\u00f4tel de Massilian == The museum is housed in h\u00f4tel de Massilian, named after the family which owned it in the 18th century. It was built in 1694 to designs by Jean P\u00e9ru. Abb\u00e9 Massilian, historian of Avignon and provost-coadjutor of the church of Saint-Didier there, was born in the h\u00f4tel on 11 April 1721.Joseph Girard, \u00c9vocation du Vieil Avignon, Les \u00c9ditions de Minuit, Paris, 2000, p. 284. The h\u00f4tel was left to the Fondation Angladon-Dubrujeaud by Jean and Paulette Angladon-Dubrujeaud at the same time as their collection. It includes a historic staircase and elements of the original decor on the main floor.
