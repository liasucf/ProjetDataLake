    "text": "This article describes the history of West Indies cricket from 1946 to 1970. First-class cricket in the West Indies had begun in February 1865 and the federation began playing Test cricket in 1928, but it was not until the 1965-66 West Indian cricket season that a formal domestic competition was founded, this being the Shell Shield which has subsequently evolved into the Carib Beer Cup. ==Post-war cricket to 1970== West Indies cricket received a tremendous boost when its team defeated England in the 1950 Test series. The preceding few years had seen the emergence of truly great players like Frank Worrell, Everton Weekes and Clyde Walcott, and Gary Sobers followed during the 1950s. In 1965, Shell Oil sponsored its Shell Shield and the West Indies at last had a true domestic championship. At first the new competition involved Barbados, British Guiana, Jamaica, Trinidad & Tobago and the Combined Islands team which was an amalgam of Leeward Islands cricket team and Windward Islands cricket team. ===Shell Shield winners to 1970=== * 1965\u201366 Barbados * 1966\u201367 Barbados * 1967\u201368 no competition * 1968\u201369 Jamaica * 1969\u201370 Trinidad and Tobago ===International tours to 1970=== ====England 1947\u201348==== * 1st Test at Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados \u2013 match drawn * 2nd Test at Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad \u2013 match drawn * 3rd Test at Bourda, Georgetown \u2013 West Indies won by 7 wickets * 4th Test at Sabina Park, Kingston \u2013 West Indies won by 10 wickets ====India 1952\u201353==== * 1st Test at Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad \u2013 match drawn * 2nd Test at Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados \u2013 West Indies won by 142 runs * 3rd Test at Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad \u2013 match drawn * 4th Test at Bourda, Georgetown \u2013 match drawn * 5th Test at Sabina Park, Kingston \u2013 match drawn ====England 1953\u201354==== * 1st Test at Sabina Park, Kingston \u2013 West Indies won by 140 runs * 2nd Test at Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados \u2013 West Indies won by 181 runs * 3rd Test at Bourda, Georgetown \u2013 England won by 9 wickets * 4th Test at Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad \u2013 match drawn * 5th Test at Sabina Park, Kingston \u2013 England won by 9 wickets ====Australia 1954\u201355==== * 1st Test at Sabina Park, Kingston \u2013 Australia won by 9 wickets * 2nd Test at Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad \u2013 match drawn * 3rd Test at Bourda, Georgetown \u2013 Australia won by 8 wickets * 4th Test at Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados \u2013 match drawn * 5th Test at Sabina Park, Kingston \u2013 Australia won by an innings and 82 runs ====E.
