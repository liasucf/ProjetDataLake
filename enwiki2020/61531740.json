The film received very good reviews from Los Angeles Times (\u201cWarsaw Uprising\u201d is not only a unique, remarkably assembled documentary-narrative hybrid but also a powerful look at the personal and public devastation that can occur during wartime. Movies rarely feel as authentic as this\u201d) to Village Voice (Despite its context in a global conflict, \u201cUprising\u201d is a strangely intimate film.) to Times of Israel (\u2026a mesmerizing account of the fierce house-to-house fighting against the German.) Warsaw Uprising was awarded with Golden Reel Award 2015 for Best Documentary and Polish Film Award for Best Documentary and Best Sound Design. His biggest box office success came with a blockbuster he wrote and directed - an epic period film Warsaw 44 (2014). He wrote the script in January 2006 and the film took 8 years to produce.
