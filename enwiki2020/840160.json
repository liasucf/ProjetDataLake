Schloss Reichenberg Schloss Reichenberg entrance ===Schloss Reichenberg=== Today\u2019s Schloss Reichenberg (palace) came into being as Richenburg Castle in the 13th century, and had its first documentary mention in 1307. Worth noting is the Herrenhaus (\u201cLord\u2019s house\u201d), or Palas. The Palas was called the Crooked Building (Krummer Bau) for its crooked footprint. Here on 14 February 1776, Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck, who later became a prominent botanist, zoologist and mycologist, was born. He was a friend of Goethe\u2019s, a cofounder of the University of Bonn and the Bonn Botanical Garden, President of the Leopoldina for 40 years and Director of the Botanical Garden in Breslau (now Wroc\u0142aw in Poland), where he died on 16 March 1858. Until the mid 19th century, the castle was undergoing continual changes in noble ownership. From 1876 to 1924, the castle, now styled Schloss Reichenberg, was used as a private upperclass boys\u2019 school. Thereafter, the Siefert family from the Frohnhof took over the palace. They sold some of the buildings in 1963 as a holiday home to Deutsche Bundespost. In July 1979, Schloss Reichenberg was bought by the ecumenical community Offensive Junger Christen (OJC, literally \u201cYoung Christians\u2019 Offensive\u201d, but known in English as the Reichenberg Fellowship). They converted it into a publicly accessible international meeting and conference centre with a palace caf\u00e9. The upper, older part of the palace, the so-called Crooked Building, is currently being renovated. ==Economy and infrastructure== ===Transport=== By way of Bundesstra\u00dfen 47 (Nibelungenstra\u00dfe between Michelstadt and Worms) and 38 (between Ro\u00dfdorf bei Darmstadt and Weinheim/Mannheim), which together run through the community, Reichelsheim is linked to the long-distance road network. Bus connections to Bensheim, F\u00fcrth im Odenwald, Reinheim and Michelstadt afford a link to the public railway network (Deutsche Bahn and Odenwaldbahn). ==Sons and daughters of the community== Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck (1855) * Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck (1776-1858), botanist and natural philosopher * Carl Geist (1870-1931), German landscape painter ==References== ==External links== * Reichelsheim\u2019s official website * Unter-Ostern * Beerfurth Category:Odenwaldkreis ",
