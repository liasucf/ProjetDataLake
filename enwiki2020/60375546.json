The band is composed of drummer Ed Charreun, guitarist Bryan Elkins, bassist and vocalist Susan Lutin, and lead guitarist and vocalist Michael Tarlazzi. Tarlazzi is the former drummer for the groups Thomas Francis Takes His Chances, and Polina and the Pyramids. Their music is called \"everything your mom didn't want you listening to\" by The Jersey Journal and \"achingly melancholy to High on Fire heavy\" by MetalSucks, and classified as a blend of 1970s metal, psychedelia, punk and hard rock. The band cites musical influence from Deep Purple, Black Sabbath and Thin Lizzy. A three-track demo Other, produced by Mike Tar, was released on 28 January 2014. Their debut four-track EP Black Wail was released on 25 September 2014. It was recorded at Moonlight Mile Studios, mixed by Mike Moebius and mastered by John Seymour.
