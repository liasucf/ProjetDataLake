    "text": "The Kitsap BlueJackets were an amateur baseball team located in Bremerton, Washington. They played in the West Coast League, a collegiate summer baseball league, from 2004 to 2016. Kitsap called the Gene Lobe Field at Kitsap County Fairgrounds and Event Center home. The BlueJackets' mascot was Jack the BlueJacket. ==History== In 1946, local community leaders had a dream about establishing professional baseball on the Kitsap Peninsula. The result was the Bremerton Bluejackets, the county\u2019s first and only professional baseball team. In 2004, another group of baseball entrepreneurs led by Rick Smith, bought the Kitsap Bluejackets and became an inaugural member of the prestigious West Coast League, a collegiate woodbat league founded in 2011. In 2015, a new ownership group with MACK Athletics and Matt Acker purchased the team. In 2016, ownership relocated the team to Port Angeles, Washington and renamed them the Port Angeles Lefties. ==References== ==External links== * West Coast League official website Category:Amateur baseball teams in Washington (state) Category:Bremerton, Washington Category:2004 establishments in Washington (state) Category:Baseball teams established in 2004 Category:2016 disestablishments in Washington (state) Category:Sports clubs disestablished in 2016 ",
