The building which was used as the main entrance block remains a Grade II listed building. ==History== The facility has its origins in a small hospital for sick children established by a Mr and Mrs Tudor in a private house in Brandon Road. It moved to Salisbury Road as the Leyton, Walthamstow and Wanstead Hospital in 1880. After acquiring additional premises in Orford Road, the facility became the Children's and General Hospital for Leyton, Leytonstone, Walthamstow and Wanstead in 1894. It was renamed the Connaught Hospital after its patron, the Duchess of Connaught, in 1928. It acquired additional facilities in Orford Road in 1930 and, after joining the National Health Service in 1948, expanded further acquiring the old town hall in Orford Road as well in 1959. After patients had been transferred to the North Middlesex Hospital, it closed in 1977 and, while most of the buildings were subsequently demolished, the old town hall was converted into an I-Kuan Tao temple and the former pathology department became the Waltham Forest Asian Centre. ==References== Category:Defunct hospitals in London Category:Hospitals established in 1878 Category:1869 establishments in England ",
