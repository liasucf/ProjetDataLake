He played local football with Sevenoaks Town and then in the Northampton area with Northampton Nomads and Higham Ferrers Town, and had unsuccessful trials with Football League clubs Northampton Town and Bristol Rovers, before signing for Norwich City in late 1934, initially as an amateur. He scored nine goals from 32 Second Division matches over two seasons, and then dropped down a level to join Brighton & Hove Albion for a \"sizeable\" fee in June 1937. After three months in the reserves, he displaced Jimmy Cargill from the team and established himself as first-team regular. In the 18 months before league football was suspended for the duration of the Second World War, he played in 56 matches in all competitions and scored nine goals. Goffey served as an Army physical training instructor. He was evacuated from Dunkirk in 1940, and went on to serve in Italy where he was mentioned in despatches in 1944. After the war, he settled in Northampton where he worked on the railway. He died in the town in 1991 at the age of 80. ==References== Category:1911 births Category:1991 deaths Category:People from Sevenoaks Category:English footballers Category:Association football inside forwards Category:Sevenoaks Town F.C. players Category:Higham Ferrers Town F.C. players Category:Northampton Town F.C. players Category:Bristol Rovers F.C. players Category:Northampton Nomads F.C. players Category:Norwich City F.C. players Category:Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. players Category:English Football League players ",
