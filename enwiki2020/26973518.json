    "text": "The United States Senate elections of 1888 and 1889 were elections that coincided with Benjamin Harrison's victory over incumbent President Grover Cleveland. Both parties were unchanged in the regular elections, but later special elections would give Republicans an eight-seat majority, mostly from newly admitted states. As these elections were prior to ratification of the seventeenth amendment, Senators were chosen by state legislatures. == Results summary == Senate Party Division, 51st Congress (1889\u20131891) * Majority Party: Republican (39 to 51) * Minority Party: Democratic (37 to 35) * Other Parties: (0) * Total Seats: 76 to 88 == Change in Senate composition == === Before the elections === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=750px |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | colspan=2 | |- | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | RA |- | colspan=9 align=right | Majority with Readjuster in caucus \u2192 | rowspan=2 | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | colspan=2 | |} === After the elections === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=750px |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | colspan=2 | |- | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | V |- | colspan=9 align=right | Majority due to vacancy \u2192 | rowspan=2 | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | colspan=2 | |} === Beginning of the next Congress === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=750px |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | colspan=2 | |- | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | rowspan=2 | R |- | colspan=9 align=right | Majority \u2192 |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | colspan=2 | |} === End of 1889 === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=750px |- | colspan=9 | | | D |- | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | R | | R | | R | rowspan=2 | R |- | colspan=9 align=right | Majority \u2192 |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | colspan=9 | | | R |} {| |- valign=top !
