    "text": "Constance of York, Countess of Gloucester ( \u2013 28 November 1416) was the only daughter of Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, and his wife Isabella of Castile, daughter of King Peter of Castile and his favourite mistress, Mar\u00eda de Padilla. ==Family== Constance was born in about 1375, the only daughter of Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, and his wife, Isabella of Castile, the youngest daughter of King Peter of Castile and his mistress, Mar\u00eda de Padilla. ==Plots against Henry IV== Constance married Thomas le Despenser, 1st Earl of Gloucester who was created Earl of Gloucester by King Richard II on 29 September 1397, but after Richard's deposition and the accession of King Henry IV some of Thomas's lands were seized and he was degraded from the earldom. In consequence in late December 1399 he and others joined in a plot, known as the Epiphany Rising, to assassinate King Henry and restore King Richard to the throne. According to a French chronicle the plot was betrayed to the King by Constance's brother, Edward; however contemporary English chronicles make no mention of Edward's alleged role. Gloucester escaped immediate capture, but was eventually turned in to the authorities at Bristol, where he was beheaded on 13 January 1400.; . After her husband's death, Constance was granted a life interest in the greater part of his lands and custody of her son due her close kinship to the king.; . In February 1405, during the rebellion of Owain Glynd\u0175r, Constance herself instigated a plot to abduct the young Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, and his brother, Roger Mortimer, from Windsor Castle, apparently intending to deliver the young Earl, who had the best claim to the throne of any of Henry IV's rivals, to his uncle Sir Edmund Mortimer, who was married to Glyndwr's daughter. The young Edmund Mortimer and his brother were recaptured before entering Wales. Constance implicated her elder brother, Edward, in the plot, as a result of which he was imprisoned for 17 weeks at Pevensey Castle, but was eventually restored to Henry IV's favour as well as the seized property of Constance who had been sent to Kenilworth Castle. Constance died in 1416 after the accession of Henry V, outliving her both siblings, but she was buried at the High Altar in Reading Abbey as late as 1420. ==Marriage and issue== Shortly before 7 November 1379 Constance married Thomas le Despenser, 1st Earl of Gloucester (1373\u20131400),Pugh, T.
