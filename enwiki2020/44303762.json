Her father is from Chimbote, Peru, and her mother is from Chiclayo, Peru. She lived in Peru from age 12 to 17, when she returned to the United States to attend college. Morales graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor's degree in Global Affairs and French and a master's degree in public policy. She received a juris doctorate from the University of Maryland School of Law and received a public service award from the law school. While in law school, Morales competed in the National Latina/o Law Student Association's sixth annual moot court competition. ==Career== Morales served as Senate Special Assistant to District 19 Senator Roger Manno. She currently works as a prevailing wage investigator for the District of Columbia Building Construction Trades Council. Morales ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in 2014, to represent the state's 19th legislative district, which includes parts of Silver Spring, Aspen Hill, and Gaithersburg. She ran to replace Sam Arora, who did not seek reelection. Morales supports equal educational opportunities for all Marylanders. She also emphasizes labor laws protecting immigrants from exploitation. Her candidacy was endorsed by CASA in Action, Maryland State and District of Columbia AFL-CIO, Montgomery County Volunteer Fire and Rescue Association, Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 35, United Auto Workers, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1994, NARAL Pro-Choice Maryland PAC, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Maryland, Maryland Votes for Animals, and Maryland League of Conservation Voters. The Washington Post's editorial board endorsed her campaign. Morales won the general election, and her term of office began on January 14, 2015. For her first term of office, Morales is a member of the Judiciary Committee, the Criminal Justice Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, the Family Law Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, and the Women Legislators of Maryland. In addition, Morales joined the newly formed Maryland Latino Legislative Caucus, a caucus formed to express the views of the Latino community, increase Latino voting, support Latino businesses, and support Latinos in local leadership. Morales co-sponsored the \"Death with Dignity Act\", which would allow a licensed health care professional to withhold or withdraw a medically administered life-sustaining procedure to an adult with a terminal illness if the person requests so, both orally and in writing, witnessed by two individuals. The Death with Dignity National Center supports the bill, calling it a tremendous comfort to patients who are terminally ill and to their families. The Maryland Catholic Conference is opposed to the bill, saying the bill does not require medical professionals to assess the patient for depression, it does not require an independent witness when administering the dose, and it does not require patients to notify family members. Morales is a member of the Workgroup to Study Safe Harbor Policy for Youth Victims of Human Trafficking. The Workgroup is studying the subject of minors who are victims of human trafficking and what legal protections and services Maryland should offer them. Morales did not win reelection in 2018. In the Democratic primary election, where the top three candidates advance to the general election, Morales came in fourth place with 16 percent of the vote. ==Election history== ===2014 primary election=== ===2014 general election=== ===2018 primary election=== ==References== ==External links== *Campaign website Category:1987 births Category:American lawyers Category:American people of Peruvian descent Category:George Mason University alumni Category:Hispanic and Latino American women in politics Category:Living people Category:Maryland Democrats Category:Members of the Maryland House of Delegates Category:People from Arlington County, Virginia Category:People from Silver Spring, Maryland Category:University of Maryland School of Law alumni Category:Women state legislators in Maryland Category:21st-century American politicians Category:21st-century American women politicians ",
