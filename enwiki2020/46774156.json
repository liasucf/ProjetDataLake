    "text": "Twelve Reasons to Die II is the twelfth studio album by American rapper and Wu-Tang Clan member Ghostface Killah. It is the sequel to his 2013 album Twelve Reasons to Die. The album was released on July 10, 2015, by Linear Labs. The album features guest appearances from Raekwon, RZA, Scarub, Vince Staples, Lyrics Born, Chino XL and Bilal. ==Critical reception== Twelve Reasons to Die II received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72 based on 18 reviews, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\". David Jeffries of AllMusic said, \"Like the films Superman 2 and Aliens, the concept LP Twelve Reasons to Die II meets, and for action junkies exceeds, the high standard set by its predecessor.\" Dan Caffrey of Consequence of Sound said, \"If we\u2019re only judging Twelve Reasons to Die II on this kind of story-driven criteria, then it\u2019s a knockout. As with its predecessor, the narrative is a marriage of exploitation horror and urban street drama, an elaboration on the kind of grit-meets-gimmick composition that the various members of Wu-Tang Clan have been pulling off for over two decades.\" Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork Media said, \"If Twelve Reasons to Die is a comic, then its sequel is the cinematic adaptation or a reboot of the franchise; the source material is the same, but the execution is tightened in places. It has a bigger-budget feel\u2014stronger guests, better pacing, and a more careful consideration for its audience.\" Kevin Ritchie of Now said, \"What it lacks is an interesting emotional \u2013 and thus truly cinematic \u2013 dimension. The vast majority of lyrics are either narrative exposition or revelling in the primordial thrill of gangsterism, and Ghostface rarely delves beneath the violent macho facade. When he does, it\u2019s only during the climactic and clich\u00e9d moment of rebirth.\" Jesse Fairfax of HipHopDX said, \"The majority of Twelve Reasons To Die II is Adrian Younge\u2019s mere reinterpretation of Ghostface Killah\u2019s beloved crime tales. \u201cBlack Out\u201d comes close to a vintage feel, but the tracks ultimately distract from the album\u2019s plot. Narrated by RZA, the surprise ending sets up an inevitable yet unnecessary third part to come down the line.\" ==Track listing== *All songs are produced by Adrian Younge. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !
