    "text": "The Bonneville House is a historic house at 318 North 7th Street in Fort Smith, Arkansas. It is a two-story brick structure, with a metal hip roof and a brick foundation. Built in 1880, its styling is predominately Second Empire, with elaborate window hoods, heavy paired brackets in the eaves, and a full- width porch with turned balusters and posts with finely-detailed capitals. In addition to its locally distinctive architecture, the house is historically significant as the home of explorer Benjamin Bonneville. The house has been restored and is available for event rentals. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Sebastian County, Arkansas ==References== ==External links== * Bonneville House - official site Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1880 Category:Houses in Fort Smith, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Sebastian County, Arkansas ",
