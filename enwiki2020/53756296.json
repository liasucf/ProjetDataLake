    "text": "Guan Yi (; born 1962) is a Hong Kong virologist. In 2014, he was ranked as 11th in the world by Thomson Reuters (now known as Clarivate Analytics) among global researchers in the field of microbiology. He obtained his PhD in microbiology at the University of Hong Kong and is now a professor of microbiology at his alma mater. His research on the viral respiratory disease SARS helped the Chinese government avert the 2004 outbreak of this disease. He is the current Director (China affairs) of the State Key Laboratory for Emerging Infectious Diseases University of Hong Kong. In early 2017, Guan warned that the H7N9 influenza virus \"poses the greatest threat to humanity than any other in the past 100 years.\" ==Education== Guan received his MD degree from the Medical College of Nanchang University (also known as Jiangxi Medical College), his advanced medical degree from Peking Union Medical College, and his PhD from the University of Hong Kong. ==Career== Focusing his research on influenza viruses throughout his career, Guan has identified all the major precursors and transmission pathways of the H5N1 variant that circulates in Southeast Asia, Europe and Africa and has provided most of the World Health Organization recommended pre-pandemic H5N1 vaccines strains. Guan has, also, initiated the systematic study of H9N2 viruses, which, along with H5 viruses that are now regarded as the most likely novel influenza subtypes to cause a pandemic. Guan has defined the role of domestic ducks in harboring and spreading influenza viruses and made major contributions in recognizing the emergence, evolutionary history and development of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus and revealed the genesis, infection source, evolutionary pathway and possible transmission route of the 2017 emerging H7N9 influenza virus. Guan has also contributed to the identification of animal reservoirs for coronaviruses, leading a team to identify bats as a reservoir host for SARS- CoV and palm civets as an intermediate host for SARS-CoV. ==COVID-19 pandemic== Guan Yi has given expert comments on SARS-CoV-2 when interviewed by Caixin, warning that the coronavirus could be 10 times worse than the 2003 Sars outbreak. He said to media, \"\"I have been through so many [disease outbreaks], and I have never been scared. Most [of the outbreaks] are manageable, but this time I am scared.\" What he said in his interview with Caixin were apparently different from that in most Chinese media, and it became highly controversial as journalists of state media reposted his previous statement, which he made on 15 January, claiming that the disease was manageable. The journalists also reposted the information that Guan's lab was once fined by the government in 2005. Wang Duan, the Caixin journalist who interviewed Guan Yi, described such behavior as \"personal attacks\" and complained that no expert had so far come forward to refute what Guan said. Guan Yi didn't give interview since 23 January.in English news and in Chinese news In mid July when a cluster of resurgent cases in Beijing was reported, Guan was interviewed by iNewsweek journal \uff08\u4e2d\u56fd\u65b0\u95fb\u5468\u520a\uff09 which shared his supportive opinion to the speculation that the virus imported into Beijing via contaminated frozen salmon fishes. ==Appearances in popular media== In 2005, Time featured Guan as one of its 18 \"Global Health Heroes\", and in 2006, named him an \"Asian Hero\" for his influenza virus research work. ==Academic publications== Guan's publication record contained in the United States National Institutes of Health PubMed database shows his having over 280 peer- reviewed articles with over 26,000 citations and an h-index of 79. == References == Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of Hong Kong Category:Biologists from Jiangxi Category:Chinese virologists Category:Nanchang University alumni Category:Peking Union Medical College alumni Category:People from Ganzhou Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:University of Hong Kong faculty Category:Coronavirus researchers ",
