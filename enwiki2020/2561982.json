    "text": "The Regina Capitals were a professional ice hockey team originally based in the city of Regina, Saskatchewan in the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL), founded in 1921. ==Western Canada Hockey League Capitals (1921\u20131926)== 1921 was the Regina Capitals' first season in the new Western Canada Hockey League, they finished second overall and then upset the Edmonton Eskimos in the playoffs to win the league championship. Winning the league championship meant that the team had to face the winner of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) before being able to challenge for the Stanley Cup. Unfortunately, the up-start Capitals lost to the Vancouver Millionaires of the PCHA. Vancouver went on to face the Toronto St. Patricks of the National Hockey League (NHL), but would lose the best-of-five series for the Stanley Cup 3 games to 2. They finished second overall in each of their first three seasons, with their third season only one point behind first place, but that first season would be the only one in which they would win the playoffs and advance to the next series. After three seasons well above .500, they fell to last place overall in their fourth season (1924\u201325) with only 8 wins in 28 games. The Capitals tried spending their way out of their difficulties, but that only caused more problems. With the team in debt and losing money, they followed the NHL's example of heading south across the border and moved to Portland, Oregon for the start of the 1925\u201326 WHL season. The Regina Capitals renamed themselves the Portland Rosebuds, which was a rekindling of an older, then defunct, team from the PCHA. With that move, they became the only United States-based team in their league. Since they moved to the States, the league had to change its name to reflect that not all of its teams were based in Canada anymore. So, the \"Canada\" part of the league's name was dropped and it was renamed the Western Hockey League. The move didn't help the on-ice performance of the team very much. They didn't finish last overall, but with an extra eight games played from the previous season, they only managed to better their total wins by 4 giving them 12 wins in 36 games. After that season, the Western Hockey League folded. The National Hockey League bought every contract of ever player from the WHL for $258,000. The former Capitals/Rosebuds players would go on to form the nucleus of the expansion Chicago Black Hawks franchise, which began play the following season. ==Prairie Hockey League Capitals (1926\u20131927)== With the collapse of the WHL, many of the players and teams that didn't become part of the NHL re-grouped and formed a new semi-pro league called the Prairie Hockey League (PrHL). A \"new\" Regina Capitals were born. They finished third overall in the inaugural season of the PrHL, but faltered badly for the second season with only two wins in 26 games. That second season would be the final season for both the Regina Capitals and the Prairie Hockey League as the league disbanded following the season's end. ==Season-by-season record== Note: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, GF= Goals For, GA = Goals Against, Pts = Points {| cellpadding=5 |- bgcolor=\"#dddddd\" | Season ||Team name & League || GP || W || L || T || PTS || GF || GA || Finish || Playoffs |- |1921\u201322 ||Regina Capitals (WCHL) || 24 ||14 ||10|| 0 ||28|| 94 ||78 || 2nd in WCHL || Won league Championship |- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |1922\u201323 ||Regina Capitals (WCHL) || 30|| 16|| 14 || 0 || 32||93 ||97 || 2nd in WCHL || Lost in WCHL finals |- |1923\u201324 ||Regina Capitals (WCHL) || 30|| 17 ||11 ||2 ||36 ||83 ||67 || 2nd in WCHL || Lost in WCHL finals |- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" ||1924\u201325 ||Regina Capitals (WCHL) || 28 ||8 ||20 ||0 ||16 ||72 ||121 || 6th (last) in WCHL || Out of playoffs |- |1925\u201326 ||Portland Rosebuds (WHL) || 36 ||12 ||16|| 8 ||26|| 84 ||106 ||4th in WHL || Out of playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |1926\u201327 || Regina Capitals (PrHL) || 32|| 14 ||16 ||2|| 30|| 110 ||117 || 3rd in PrHL || |- ||1927\u201328 || Regina Capitals (PrHL) ||26|| 2 ||19|| 5 || 9|| 46 ||89 ||3rd (last) in PrHL || |} ==Head coach== *Wes Champ ==Notable players== * Eddie Shore, 1924\u20131925 (later to Edmonton, then to Boston Bruins (NHL)) * Dick Irvin, 1922\u20131925 Chicago Black Hawks ==See also== *Western Canada Hockey League *Pacific Coast Hockey Association *List of pre-NHL seasons *Portland Rosebuds *Chicago Black Hawks *List of ice hockey teams in Saskatchewan ==References== * * * Category:Defunct ice hockey teams in Canada Category:Defunct sports teams in Saskatchewan Category:Sport in Regina, Saskatchewan Category:Ice hockey teams in Saskatchewan Category:Ice hockey clubs established in 1921 Category:1921 establishments in Saskatchewan Category:1928 disestablishments in Saskatchewan Category:Sports clubs disestablished in 1928 ",
