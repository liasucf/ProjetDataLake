Sir Herbert Scarisbrick Naylor- Leyland, 1st Baronet (24 January 1864 \u2013 7 May 1899), was a British politician. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Naylor-Leyland was the only son of Colonel Tom Naylor-Leyland, and was born 24 January 1864. He was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and entered the Second Life Guards in 1882, becoming Captain in 1891. From 1892, he pursued a political career. ===Career=== Naylor-Leyland was returned to Parliament for Colchester as a Conservative in 1892, a seat he held until 1895 when he accepted the Chiltern Hundreds. The latter year he was created a Baronet, of Hyde Park House, Albert Gate, in the County of London. He then broke with the Conservatives and joined the Liberal Party (it was said that he was rewarded with a Baronetcy because he changed from being a Conservative to Liberal and voting with the Liberals and winning an important Vote), and represented Southport in this party's interest between 1898 and his early death in May 1899 of laryngitis, aged only 35. ===Personal life=== He was married in 1889 (aged 25) to Jeanie Willson Chamberlain, daughter of Mr and Mrs William Selah Chamberlain, of Cleveland, Ohio, USA; they had two sons.\"Captain Naylor-Leyland dead\"(full text) The New York Times, 8 May 1899.
