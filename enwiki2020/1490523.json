    "text": "Dragomir () is a Slavic masculine name, mostly found in Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Russia, and Ukraine as well as Romania. It is composed of the Slavic words drag (dear, precious) and mir (peace), both very common in Slavic dithematic names. It can be translated as To whom peace is precious, i.e. He who cares about peace. However, the ending mir, found in many Slavic names, has developed from the Old Slavic term *meru which meant 'large, great, greatly'. Thus the original Old Slavic meaning of the name would be He who is very dear or He who is very precious (to his family). The female form of the name is Dragomira (or Drahom\u00edra), Dragomirka and is also very popular. ==Notable people== *Dragomir Bojani\u0107 (1933\u20131993), Serbian actor, nicknamed Gidra *Dragomir Brajkovi\u0107 (1947\u20132009), Serbian writer, journalist, editor of Radio Belgrade, poet *Dragomir \u010cumi\u0107 (born 1937), Serbian actor *Dragomir Dujmov, Serbian poet, novelist and short story writer from Hungary *Dragomir of Duklja (born 1018), ruler of Travunia and Zachlumia *Dragomir Hurmuzescu (1865-1954), Romanian physicist *Dragimir Hvalimirovi\u0107, \u017dupan of Travunia *Dragomir Jovanovi\u0107 (1902\u20131946), Serbian politician *Dragomir Markov (born 1971), retired swimmer from Bulgaria *Dragomir Mihajlovi\u0107, Serbian rock guitarist *Dragomir Milo\u0161evi\u0107 (born 1942), Serbian commander and war criminal *Dragomir Nikoli\u0107, Serbian football manager *Dragan Okuka (born 1954), Serbian football manager and a former player *Dragomir R.
