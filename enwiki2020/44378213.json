    "text": "Thomas Murray Richard Waller FRS (d. 1715) was an English naturalist, translator and illustrator, long-time member and secretary of the Royal Society. Little is known about his early life. He became a member of the Royal Society on 27 April 1681, acting as secretary from 1687 to 1709, and again from 1710 to 1714, and member of its council from 1686 to 1699, Vice-President during Isaac Newton\u2019s presidency. Waller edited the Philosophical Transactions from 1691 to 1695, also acting as translator for submissions from abroad. Mulligan, L.: \"Waller, Richard (c.1660\u20131715)\". In: Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press, 2008 His Essays of Natural Experiments, a translation of the collection of essays Saggi di naturali esperienze of the Accademia del Cimento is one of the important early publications by the Royal Society. The archive of the Royal Society also holds a number of botanical illustrations by Waller, possibly intended for a publication by John Ray. His fossil drawings were rediscovered together with Robert Hooke\u2019s drawings in the British Library. On Hooke's death in 1703, his records were entrusted to Waller, parts of which were edited by Waller and published as Hooke\u2019s Posthumous Works (1705). Waller had an extensive library, and often exchanged books with Hooke. In 1685, Waller married Anne Blackwell (1669-1744), a daughter of the Bristol wine merchant, Jonathan Blackwell (d. 1676), and noted for funding the construction of the Christmas Steps. Waller\u2019s children did not survive to adulthood. Accordingly, Waller\u2019s estate, including the library and a house in Northaw, Hertfordshire, passed to his widow Anne. She in turn made her younger brother, Jonathan Blackwell, her sole heir. Jonathan was also a Fellow of the Royal Society, and had been nominated by Waller, though apparently he was not scientifically active. https://picturingscience.wordpress.com/2013/12/05/in-search-of-richard- wallers-library/ Waller most likely died at his residence in Northaw, Hertfordshire, at some point between 23 December 1714 and 13 January 1715. == Bibliography == Tabula Colorum Physiologica, 1686 ;Philosophical Transactions * Observations on the Cicindela Volans, or Flying Glow-Worm, with the Figure Thereof Made, and Dsiegned by Richard Waller Esq.
