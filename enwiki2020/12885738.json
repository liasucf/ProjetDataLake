    "text": "Audience with the Mind is the fourth studio album by British alternative rock band The House of Love. It was the band's final new release until 2005. ==Background== Audience With the Mind was recorded following the departure of the band\u2019s third successive lead guitarist in three years, Simon Mawby. This resulting in group leader Guy Chadwick recording all of the album\u2019s guitar parts himself (although Sean O'Hagan of The High Llamas provided additional acoustic and slide guitars). As had been the case on the band\u2019s previous album, Babe Rainbow, former band member Andrea Heukamp provided backing vocals. The album generated one single, \"Hollow\". Close to the album\u2019s release in 1993, House of Love drummer Pete Evans announced his own departure to the group. Chadwick was left to promote the finished album by himself: unsupported by live appearances, it performed poorly commercially. The House of Love would split up entirely shortly afterwards and would not reunite until 2005. ==Critical reception== MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide called the album \"uncharacteristically dreary\" and \"a tough listen.\" Trouser Press wrote that \"even half-baked and shoddily written, House of Love could routinely extract a tension, drama and resignation rarely found in modern pop.\" ==Track listing== (All songs written by Guy Chadwick except where noted) # \"Sweet Anatomy\" (Pete Evans) -3:37 # \"Audience with the Mind\" -3:34 # \"Haloes\" -3:34 # \"Erosion\" (Chris Groothuizen) -3:21 # \"Call Me\" -4:11 # \"Shining On\" -3:59 # \"Portrait in Atlanta\" -4:29 # \"Corridors\" -3:34 # \"Hollow\" (Chris Groothuizen) -4:49 # \"All Night Long\" -2:29 # \"Into the Tunnel\" -8:11 # \"You've Got to Feel\" -4:33 ==Personnel== *Guy Chadwick - lead vocals, guitars *Chris Groothuizen - bass guitar *Pete Evans - drums with *Andrea Heukamp - backing vocals *Sean O'Hagan - acoustic & slide guitars == References == Category:The House of Love albums Category:1993 albums Category:Fontana Records albums ",
