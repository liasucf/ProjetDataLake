    "text": "Victor Baltard (9 June 180513 January 1874) was a French architect famed for work in Paris including designing Les Halles market and the Saint-Augustin church. ==Life== Victor was born in Paris, son of architect Louis-Pierre Baltard and attended Lyc\u00e9e Henri IV. During his student days Baltard, a Lutheran, attended the Calvinist Temple du Marais with other Protestant students including Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann with whom he would collaborate in the latter's renovation of Paris. He later studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux- Arts, where he garnered the Prix de Rome for designing a military school in 1833. He went on to study at the French Academy in Rome, Italy, from 1834 to 1838 under the direction of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. Saint-Eustache From 1849 on, he was Architect of the City of Paris. In this office, he was responsible for the restoration of several churches, as well as the construction of the Catholic Saint-Augustin (1860-67), in which he united the structural values of stone and steel. His most popular achievement was, however, the building of Les Halles, the central market in Paris, during the years 1853 to 1870. In 1972 and 1973, however, these halls were torn down. A single hall (completed in 1854) was classified as a historical monument and moved to Nogent-sur-Marne in 1971, where it is now known as the Pavillon Baltard. Victor Baltard also built the slaughterhouses and the cattle market of Les Halles de la Villette, as well as the tombs of composer Louis James Alfred Lef\u00e9bure-W\u00e9ly at the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery and of jurist L\u00e9on Louis Rostand at Montmartre Cemetery. He was largely instrumental in introducing a regular scheme of fresco decoration by modern artists in the churches of Paris, to take the place of the heterogeneous collections of pictures of all kinds with which their walls had been promiscuously decorated. ==Works== Drawing of the main facade of the Church of Saint Augustin, Paris ;Architecture *The tomb of the composer Louis James Alfred Lef\u00e9bure-W\u00e9ly (1817\u20131869) at the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery *The 12 pavilions of Les Halles in Paris (1853\u20131870) (the Pavilion Baltard No. 8 was moved to Nogent-sur-Marne in 1971) *Cattle market of Les Halles de la Villette *Construction of the Church of St. Augustine (1860\u20131871) *Facade of Notre-Dame-des-Blancs-Manteaux: originally from the Church of St-Elois-des-Barnabites which was then located in the Ile de la Cit\u00e9, but was destroyed during the work of Haussmann and reassembled by Baltard in 1863. ;Restorations *Restoration of the church of Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois, in collaboration with Jean-Baptiste Lassus from 1838 to 1855. *Restoration of the church of Saint-Eustache, Paris in 1844. *Restoration of the chapel of Pentemont Abbey as a Protestant church in 1844. *Restoration of the church of Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont: he directed the construction of the chapel of Catechisms and restored the facade of the church between 1861 and 1868. *Restoration of the church of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s. *Restoration of the church of Saint-S\u00e9verin, Paris. *Restoration of the church of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis: The architect is responsible primarily for the redevelopment of the choir and the refurbishment of the facade. ==Gallery== File:Interior of \u00e9glise Saint-Augustin de Paris 22.JPG|Church of Saint- Augustine showing the cast iron shafts and iron-framed roof File:Pavillon Baltard - Nogent-sur-Marne.jpg|The Pavillon Baltard in Nogent-sur-Marne, the last surviving hall from Baltard's Les Halles File:Cand\u00e9labre Panth\u00e9on.JPG|Candelabra of the Panth\u00e9on File:Ingres - Mme Victor Baltard & sa fille Paule.jpg|Portrait of Victor Baltard's wife (born Adeline Lequeu) and their daughter Paule by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres ==References== Attribution: * ==External links== *\"Victor, membre de la famille\" Category:1805 births Category:1874 deaths Category:Architects from Paris Category:19th-century French architects Category:Prix de Rome for architecture Category:Alumni of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts Category:Members of the Acad\u00e9mie des beaux-arts Category:French Lutherans Category:Officiers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur ",
