    "text": "Vice President of Chile was a political position in Chile from 1826 to 1833. In 1826, jointly with the establishment of the title of President of the Republic, the position of Vice President was created, whose function was to replace the President in the cases of illness, absence and others. Agust\u00edn Eyzaguirre was elected as the first vice president in the election of 1826. Francisco Antonio Pinto was designated in the position in the election of following year. The Constitution of 1828, the only Chilean constitution that established the vicepresidency as a permanent position, provided that in case of death or physical or moral impossibility of the president, he would replace him in his post. The required qualities were the same as those required from president. The appointment of Joaqu\u00edn Vicu\u00f1a as vice president, after the election of 1829, the first under the rule of the Charter of 1828, was the object of a great controversy and is considered one of the triggers of the Revolution of 1829. The permanent position of vice president was abolished with the 1833 Constitution, Diego Portales being the last to occupy it. Since then, Vice President of the Republic is only a title for the first in the order of succession to discharge the duties of the president in case of temporary impediment or vacancy. The Vice President, in the performance of his duties, has all the powers that the Constitution confers on the President of the Republic. ==Vice Presidents== {|class=\"wikitable\" !Name !Took office !Left office !President !
