    "text": "The East Anglian derby is a sobriquet used to describe football matches held between Norwich City and Ipswich Town, the only fully professional football clubs in the neighbouring East Anglian counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, respectively. In recent years it has sometimes been humorously called the Old Farm derby, a reference to the Old Firm derby played between Celtic and Rangers, and the prominence of agriculture in East Anglia. The derby has been described as the second-fiercest rivalry in England. There have been 148 instances of the derby, with Ipswich winning 60 to Norwich's 58. The series began in the early 20th century, when both clubs were amateur organisations, with the first derby between the two professional clubs taking place in 1939. The most recent derby was on 10 February 2019, which Norwich City won 3\u20130 at their ground, Carrow Road. It has been over 10 years since Ipswich last won the derby, with their last win coming on 19 April 2009 in a 3\u20132 win at Portman Road. Winning the derby is one measure used to determine which club from the region can declare itself the \"Pride of Anglia\". Currently, there is no scheduled competitive East Anglian derby for the foreseeable future; Norwich play in the second tier of English football, while Ipswich play in the third tier. The only way the two teams could meet is if they are drawn together for a cup game, such as the FA Cup. ==Style and atmosphere== According to the Football Rivalries Report 2008, the East Anglian derby is the second-fiercest rivalry in England, after the Black Country derby between West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers. The report stated, \"The gap of 40 miles doesn't make those East Anglia 'Old Farm' derbies any less intense, and this, combined with the regularity and closeness of the games, and the recent fortunes of both clubs, put it ahead of all but one rivalry in League football.\" Former referee Keith Hackett said of the East Anglian derby: > \"As for the most aggressive atmosphere that I\u2019ve ever encountered, believe > it or not it was at Carrow Road for Norwich v Ipswich Town. There are > certain derby fixtures that you always know are going to be highly charged, > but the East Anglian derby tops the lot. The players came out of the tunnel > as if they were ready for a boxing match. The noise was intense and > aggressive.\" Rob Hadgraft, who wrote The Old Farm, suggested some reasons for the intensity of the rivalry: \"I think it's because each club represents the entire county ... There's only one club in Norfolk, and the same goes for Suffolk ... The people live up to 40 miles apart, so they don't mingle and have pals who support the other lot ... you've got two sets of fans who never really mingle or mix, and there's no proper friendships. They really do despise each other.\" ==History== Portman Road The first derby was held between the two clubs on 15 November 1902, when both sides were still playing at an amateur level. The Norfolk & Suffolk League fixture was played in Norwich and finished 1\u20130 to Norwich City. Norwich turned professional in 1905, Ipswich following in 1936. Ipswich was elected to the Football League in 1938, and the first league game between the two clubs (in the Third Division (South)) was on 2 September 1939. Played at Portman Road, Ipswich, the match finished 1\u20131, although the league was abandoned owing to the outbreak of the Second World War. Carrow Road As the clubs have tended to play in the same division over the years, the derby has been contested in most seasons since this time, the longest gap being for a period of six seasons between 1986\u201387 and 1991\u201392. Occasionally the two teams play in different divisions, resulting in the derby not being contested. This will happen in the season 2019-20 after Norwich finished top of the Championship, achieving promotion, and Ipswich finished bottom, being relegated. Two of the more notable meetings between the two clubs have come in cup competitions. In the 1972\u201373 season Ipswich beat Norwich 4\u20132 on aggregate to win the two-legged Texaco Cup, with 2\u20131 wins in both games.Anglo-Scottish Cup & Texaco Cup \u2013 Full Results. RSSSF.com Retrieved 8 May 2011. In 1985 the clubs met in the semi-final of the League Cup, with a place in the Wembley final at stake. Ipswich won the first leg 1\u20130 at Portman Road, but Norwich scored early in the return leg at Carrow Road to level the tie. With extra- time looming, Steve Bruce scored a late winner to send Norwich to Wembley.Norwich Milk Cup special: Day 3, Norwich Evening News, 24 March 2010. Retrieved 2011-05-13. In the 2014\u201315 season there were four East Anglian derbies, because the sides met in a two legged Football League Championship play-off semi-final in addition to the regular two league games played during the season. The first match of the season was held at Portman Road on 23 August; it finished with Norwich winning 1\u20130. The reverse fixture at Carrow Road was on 1 March and Norwich again won, this time 2\u20130. The two play-off ties were held on 9 and 16 May, the first at Ipswich. The first leg finished 1\u20131, and the second leg finished with Norwich taking their third derby victory of the season by winning 3\u20131 and therefore booking their place in the play-off final at Wembley Stadium. ==Statistics== The derby has been contested 115 times in competitive games, 58 of which have been played at Ipswich and 57 at Norwich. In all, Norwich have 47 victories and Ipswich 45 with 23 matches having finished as draws. The clubs have also played each other in friendlies and testimonial matches.
