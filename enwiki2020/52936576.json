    "text": "Jean-Vincent Plac\u00e9 (born 12 March 1968) is a South Korean-born, French Green politician. Adopted by a French family as a child, Plac\u00e9 entered politics as a member of the Radical Party of the Left before joining Europe Ecology \u2013 The Greens. He and fellow Green Fran\u00e7ois de Rugy left the party in 2015 to found their own Ecologist Party. He formerly was Senator for the department of Essonne, Secretary of State for State Reform and Simplification in the Second Valls government, and president of political group Union des d\u00e9mocrates et des \u00e9cologistes. == Early life and career == Little is known about Plac\u00e9's origins, apart from the fact that he spent part of his childhood in an orphanage in Suwon, South Korea. Although his birth certificate states he was born Kwon Oh-bok () in Seoul on 12 March 1968, Plac\u00e9 himself has expressed doubts about the date because of his situation as an orphan; at the time of his adoption by a French family in 1975, he reportedly appeared younger than his official age. He then grew up with his adoptive family in Normandy. After studying economics, Plac\u00e9, then 26 years old, met La Rochelle mayor and Parliament member Michel Cr\u00e9peau and became active within his party \"Movement of Radicals of the Left\" (later Radical Party of the Left). According to L'Obs, Plac\u00e9 also joined the Grand Orient de France, France's largest Masonic organization. He became an attach\u00e9 to Cr\u00e9peau until Cr\u00e9peau's death in 1999, after which Plac\u00e9 left the Radical Party and joined The Greens, which later became Europe Ecology \u2013 The Greens (EELV). == Political career == The 2004 French regional elections saw Jean-Vincent Plac\u00e9 being elected as a member of the regional council of \u00cele-de-France, on a list of candidates led by Socialist Jean-Paul Huchon, as the result of an alliance between The Greens and the Socialist Party. Plac\u00e9 was subsequently elected as the head of the Green group within the council. In 2011, under EELV membership, Plac\u00e9 was elected as senator for the department of Essonne. In 2012, he became the first president of the newly-formed Ecologist group in the French Senate. In 2014, Plac\u00e9 publicly criticized the \"leftist\" direction his party was allegedly taking and lamented it had become \"the party of Romani people and Palestine\" instead of focusing on environmental issues. Eventually, in 2015, upset by talks of alliance between EELV and the Left Front for the regional elections, Jean-Vincent Plac\u00e9 and Fran\u00e7ois de Rugy both left EELV and founded their own centre-left, green party, \u00c9cologistes ! (later the Ecologist Party). The party then participated in the creation of political group Union des d\u00e9mocrates et des \u00e9cologistes (UDE) of which Plac\u00e9 became the first president. From 2016 to 2017, he was appointed by then-Prime Minister Manuel Valls as \"Secretary of State for State Reform and Simplification\" in Valls's second government. In order to access government office, Plac\u00e9 stepped down from his positions as senator and president of the Senate's Ecologist group. In 2016, Plac\u00e9 applied for the honorary title of Colonel of the citizen reserve forces within the 13th Parachute Dragoon Regiment. In December 2016, when Bernard Cazeneuve was appointed Prime Minister, Plac\u00e9 retained his position within his government as Secretary of State for State Reform and Simplification. In the 2017 Socialist primaries, Jean-Vincent Plac\u00e9 showed support for former Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who eventually lost the primary to Beno\u00eet Hamon. Plac\u00e9 then backed the Socialist candidate Hamon during the presidential campaign. Following the formation of Prime Minister \u00c9douard Philippe's first government in 2017, Plac\u00e9 was no longer a member of the French government and took back his position within the Senate, this time as a member of the Socialist and Republican group. In September 2017, after being mugged in the streets of Paris, he publicly expressed his desire to put his political career on hold, thus declining to stand in the then-upcoming senatorial elections. When Plac\u00e9 made his announcement, his name was not on any candidate list for the Senate. He remained a member of the regional council of \u00cele-de-France. In April 2018, following issues with alcoholism and a publicized incident in a Paris nightclub, Plac\u00e9 resigned from his position as president of UDE. == Legal issues == In 2011, during an appearance on television, Plac\u00e9 reacted to then- UMP member of Parliament Christian Vanneste's recent comments about same-sex marriage, by calling Vanneste \"despicable\" and claiming he had a reputation for \"homophobic\", \"racist\", \"maybe even antisemitic\" remarks. Vanneste then sued Plac\u00e9 for defamation. A Paris court eventually sentenced Plac\u00e9 to a fine and ordered him to pay Vanneste in damages. In 2013, an investigation by newspaper Le Canard encha\u00een\u00e9 revealed that Plac\u00e9 owed more than to the region of \u00cele-de-France, mostly in unpaid traffic fines. Plac\u00e9, who acknowledged his mistake, explained he was \"not a man of numbers\" and swore to pay his fines. In 2014, he stormed out of a talk show where the topic was brought up again, saying his situation was now resolved. In September 2017, Plac\u00e9 was assaulted in the streets of Paris: the robbers took his cellphone, credit card, and watch. Plac\u00e9 later told the press he was considering putting his political career on hold. On the night between 4 and 5 April 2018, an intoxicated Plac\u00e9 was arrested outside a Paris nightclub by French police and kept into custody for 37 hours. He was charged with \"disrespect towards police officers\", \"racial insults\" and \"violent behavior under the influence\", and brought to the courts. Plac\u00e9 then resigned from his position as president of UDE. In an interview with Paris Match, Plac\u00e9 apologized for disorderly intoxication and revealed he had been struggling with alcoholism for several months. However, he denied allegations of any sexist or racist behavior. In September 2018, a Paris court found him guilty of \"acts of violence\" and gave him a fine and a three-month suspended sentence, while dismissing the charge of \"racial insults\". == Personal life == Although Plac\u00e9 was born in South Korea and spent part of his childhood there, he claims little relation to his birth country and credits his identity to education within the \"School of the [French] Republic\". After being adopted in 1975 by a French family he describes as politically \"Gaullist\", he did not set foot in South Korea again until an official visit in 2011. While there, he said to the local press \"France is my country\" and reportedly told locals he was unable to speak their language. Plac\u00e9 was previously in a relationship with fellow Green politician C\u00e9cile Duflot. After the end of what Plac\u00e9 calls a \"love story\", he began a relationship with another Green politician, French Parliament member \u00c9va Sas. Together they had a daughter who was born in November 2013. Plac\u00e9 and Sas separated in 2014. ==Authored books== * ==References== Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:French politicians of Korean descent Category:French Senators of the Fifth Republic Category:South Korean adoptees Category:Senators of Essonne Category:South Korean emigrants to France Category:People from Seoul Category:Knights of the National Order of Merit (France) Category:University of Caen alumni Category:Government ministers of France ",
