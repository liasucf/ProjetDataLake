    "text": "\"Make Me Feel\" is a song by American singer Janelle Mon\u00e1e, released on February 22, 2018 as the lead single from her third studio album, Dirty Computer. This marks her reunion after a 3 year hiatus. departure from her longtime songwriting-production team of Nathaniel Irvin III and Roman GianArthur Irvin, Mon\u00e1e co-wrote the song with Julia Michaels, Mattias Larsson, Robin Fredriksson, and Justin Tranter. Several critics compared it to the work of Prince, while Mon\u00e1e herself has stated that Prince helped create sounds for the album, including for \"Make Me Feel\". It became Mon\u00e1e's second single as a lead artist to chart on the US Billboard Hot 100, debuting at number 99 on the week of March 10, 2018. ==Critical reception== Writing for Pitchfork, Marcus J. Moore says of Mon\u00e1e and the song, \"The polymath unpacks a rubbery funk tune that recalls the likes of Prince and Sheila E. Her 1980s influences are clear, down to each massive synth line and the feeling of raw sensual energy woven throughout the song.\" Tatiana Pile of Spin wrote, \"The single is a high-energy funk song with some reverent similarities to Prince's 'Kiss' ... With this bouncy single, Mon\u00e1e taps into her unique soul-pop sound to deliver a song reminiscent of past tracks such as 'Q.U.E.E.N.' and 'Dance Apocalyptic'.\" ==Music video== The single's official music video was uploaded to YouTube on February 22, 2018, the day of the single's release. Directed by frequent music video collaborator Alan Ferguson, the music video features Mon\u00e1e and actress Tessa Thompson in a nightclub. Referred to by Mon\u00e1e as an \"emotion picture\", the video heavily resembles the nightclub and plot shown in the Black Mirror episode, \"San Junipero\". Throughout the video, Mon\u00e1e is seen flirting with both Thompson and a man; at one point she runs between the two as if she cannot decide which one she wants. Ultimately, she dances with both. Also throughout the video, the colors of the bisexual pride flag are displayed in the overhead lighting, so-called \"bisexual lighting\". The music video, as well as the song, was praised as a \"bisexual anthem.\" Writing for Billboard, Natalie Maher states the video, \"takes a more Prince-inspired approach, both musically and aesthetically, with the actress hitting an '80s-esque club with actress Tessa Thompson, and serving some of the best moves and looks we've seen from her. The video also features what seems to be an allusion to Robert Palmer's iconic '80s videos, with Monae playing a similarly white guitar, backed by her own group of funky female dancers.\" The video received two nominations at the 35th MTV Video Music Awards in the categories \"Best Art Direction\" and \"Best Editing\". ==Live performances== Mon\u00e1e has performed the song live on The Voice, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Austin City Limits, 61st Annual Grammy Awards, and 2019 Lollapalooza. ==Track listings== * Kaskade Remixes single # \"Make Me Feel\" (Kaskade Sunsoa Remix) # \"Make Me Feel\" (Kaskade REDUX Remix) * EDX Dubai Skyline Remix single # \"Make Me Feel\" (EDX Dubai Skyline Remix) * KC Lights Remix single # \"Make Me Feel\" (KC Lights Remix) # \"Make Me Feel\" (KC Lights Dub) ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) !scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Heatseekers (RMNZ) | 7 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Romania (Airplay 100) | 25 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) !scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Belgium (Ultratop Wallonia) | 90 |} ==Release history== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| Various | February 22, 2018 | Digital download | Bad Boy | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\"| United States | February 27, 2018 | Contemporary hit radio | rowspan=\"3\"| Atlantic | |- | March 5, 2018 | Hot adult contemporary radio | |- | March 6, 2018 | Urban radio | |} ==References== Category:2018 singles Category:2018 songs Category:Janelle Mon\u00e1e songs Category:Songs written by Janelle Mon\u00e1e Category:LGBT-related songs Category:Funk songs Category:Song recordings produced by Mattman & Robin Category:Songs written by Julia Michaels Category:Songs written by Justin Tranter Category:Songs written by Mattias Larsson Category:Songs written by Robin Fredriksson ",
