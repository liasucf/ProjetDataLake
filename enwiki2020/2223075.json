Marcelo Fernan Bridge is an extradosed cable-stayed bridge located in Metro Cebu in the Philippines. It spans across Mactan Channel connecting Mandaue City to Lapu-Lapu City in Mactan Island. It is currently the longest cable-stayed bridge in the Philippines Before it was named the Marcelo Fernan Bridge, it was called the Consolacion Bridge (which was a temporary name), named after the Municipality of Consolacion, which is 1.6 miles (or 2.6 kilometers) from the north end of the bridge. == History == Marcelo Fernan Bridge was opened in August 1999 to decongest the traffic from the older Mactan\u2013Mandaue Bridge. The bridge has a total length of 1237 meters (4058.40 feet) with a center span of 185 meters (606.96 feet), and was completed and inaugurated by President Joseph Estrada on August 3, 1999. The bridge is one of the widest and longest bridge spans in the Philippines. The bridge was constructed with the help of the Japanese Government. It was named after Senator Marcelo Fernan, a political figure from Cebu City. == Additional information == On the Mactan Island side of the bridge, there is a park called the Millennium Park at the base of the bridge's piers, and the Filipino Seafarers Memorial is located in that park. Also, the bridge has two pedestrian walkways, one on the north side of the bridge, and one on the south side. On the Cebu Island side of the bridge, there is Mandaue City, and the bridge is accessed via United Nations Avenue. The Mactan Island side of the bridge, which is in Lapu-Lapu City, is accessed by Old Patiller Road, a spur road of the Manuel L. Quezon National Highway. The bridge also sits astride the northern end of the Mactan Channel, which is a gateway to the Cebu International Port which is managed by the Cebu Port Authority, where about 80% of domestic and international shipping operators and shipbuilders in the Philippines are located. The Mactan-Mandaue Bridge is located about 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) south of the Marcelo Fernan Bridge. == See also == * Extradosed bridge * Cable-stayed bridge == References == ==External links== * Marcelo Fernan Bridge @ Structurae * * WebSite for Mandaue City * WebSite for Lapu-Lapu City * Picture of the Filipino Seafarers Memorial. * Picture of the Millenium Park under the bridge and another picture as well.
