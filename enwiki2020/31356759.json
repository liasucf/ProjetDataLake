    "text": "Vita Christi by Ludolph of Saxony, Vol. 1, folio. The Vita Christi (Life of Christ), also known as the Speculum vitae Christi (Mirror of the Life of Christ) is the principal work of Ludolph of Saxony, completed in 1374.Catholic encyclopedia The book is not just a biography of Jesus, but also a history, a commentary borrowed from the Church Fathers, and a series of dogmatic and moral dissertations, spiritual instructions, meditations, and prayers. It was so popular in its time that it has been called a summa evangelica. ==Sources== Sr Mary Immaculate Bodenstedt mentions Ludolph's particular debt to the Meditations on the Life of Christ.Sr Mary Immaculate Bodenstedt (1944), The Vita Christi of Ludolphus the Carthusian: A dissertation, Washington: Catholic University of America Press. British Library ref. no Ac.2692y/29.(16)at page 31. \"Ludolph makes textual borrowings from more than sixty chapters out of a total of one hundred from the Mediationes of Ps.-Bonaventure especially in his sections in the Vita Christi on the Infancy of Jesus and his Passion. Bodenstedt argues that Ludolph also follows Ps.-Bonaventure in his visual method of meditation.Sr Mary Immaculate Bodenstedt (1944), The Vita Christi of Ludolphus the Carthusian: A dissertation, Washington: Catholic University of America Press. British Library ref. no Ac.2692y/29.(16), at page 31. \"He [Ludolph] frequently exhorts the reader to centre his mind upon some situation in the life of Christ by some such words as CONSPICE, CONSIDERA or VIDE\u2014similar exhortations are in the Meditationes by Thomas a Kempis. ==Influence== Vita Christi by Ludolph of Saxony. Woodcut. 1487. The great popularity of the Vita Christi is demonstrated by the numerous manuscript copies preserved in libraries and the manifold editions of it which have been published, from the first two editions of Strasbourg and Cologne, in 1474, to the last editions of Paris: folio, 1865, published by Victor Palme (heavily criticised by Father Henry James Coleridge, SJ; see below), and 8vo, 1878. It has also been translated into Catalan (Valencia, 1495, folio, Gothic), Castilian (Alcala, folio, Gothic), Portuguese (1495, 4 vols., folio), Italian (1570), French, \"by Guillaume Lernenand, of the Order of Monseigneur St. Fran\u00e7ois\", under the title of the \"Great Life of Christ\" (Lyons, 1487, folio, many times reprinted), by D. Marie-Prosper Augustine (Paris, 1864), and by D. Florent Broquin, Carthusian (Paris, 1883).Charles Abbott Conway, The Vita Christi of Ludolph of Saxony and late medieval devotion centred on the incarnation: a descriptive analysis, (Salzburg, 1976), p2 The Vita Christi had significant influence on the development of techniques for Christian meditation. Although Aelred of Rievaulx (d. 1167) had introduced the concept of immersing and projecting oneself into a Biblical scene in his De institutione inclusarum, and St. Bonaventure (d. 1274) had borrowed heavily from that work in his Lignum Vitae,Marsha L.. Dutton, \"The Cistercian Source: Aelred, Bonaventure, and Ignatius,\" in Goad and Nail: Studies in Medieval Cistercian History, X, ed. E. Rozanne Elder, Cistercian Studies series 84 (Kalamazoo: Cistercian Publications, 1985), 157\u201378. Ludolph's massive work (which quoted Aelred extensively but credited his work to Anselm) helped to spread this devotional practice into the Devotio Moderna community and to Ignatius of Loyola (as discussed below).Christian spirituality: an introduction by Alister E. McGrath 1999 pages 84\u201387 The Vita Christi was translated into Spanish in 1502 by Ambrosio Montesino and was printed in Alcala.The third spiritual alphabet by Francisco de Osuna 1981 pages 3\u20134 The methods of meditation in the Vita Christi thus entered Spain and were known in the early part of the 16th century.Teresa of Avila's autobiography by Elena Carrera 2004 page 28 St Teresa and St Francis de Sales frequently quote from it. ==Influence on St Ignatius of Loyola== Saint Ignatius of Loyola used these techniques in his Spiritual Exercises, e.g. self-projection into a Biblical scene to start a conversation with Christ in Calvary. Ludolph's Vita Christi is mentioned in almost every biography of St Ignatius of Loyola. St Ignatius read it whilst recovering from the cannon-ball wound after the siege of Pamplona in a Castilian translation.Michael Foss (1969), The founding of the Jesuits, 1540, London: Hamilton, p. 68. Ludolph proposes a method of prayer which asks the reader to visualise the events of Christ's life (known as simple contemplation). In his commentary on the Gospel for the Feast of Saint Mary Magdalen, the story where Mary the sister of Lazarus, comes into the house of the Pharisee where Jesus is eating, and washes his feet with her tears and then dries his feet with her hair, Ludolph repeatedly urges the reader to see (that is, visualise) the scene of the washing, and so on. He also has insights into the humanity and attractiveness of Jesus. He explains why Mary the public sinner overcame her shame and entered the house of the Pharisee by noting that the Pharisee was a leper and disfigured from the disease. St Mary Magdalen could see that since Jesus was prepared to eat with a leper, he would not reject her. This simple method of contemplation outlined by Ludolph and set out in Vita Christi, in many of his commentaries on the gospel stories that he chooses it can be argued influenced the Spiritual Exercises of St Ignatius of Loyola.Sr Mary Immaculate Bodenstedt (1944), The Vita Christi of Ludolphus the Carthusian: A dissertation, Washington: Catholic University of America Press. British Library ref. no Ac.2692y/29.(16). Indeed, it is said that St Ignatius had desired to become a Carthusian after his pilgrimage to Jerusalem, but was dissuaded by a Carthusian Prior. To this day members of the Society of Jesus may enter a Charterhouse, and if a vocation there does not work out, they may return to the Society of Jesus without penalty. This closeness between the Carthusians and Jesuits is arguably due to the great influence of Ludolph of Saxony's De Vita Christi on the future founder of the Society of Jesus. Michael Foss is dismissive of the influence of Ludolph on the Exercises of St Ignatius, saying \"The Exercises show a bit of Ludolph.\" Then, writing of St Ignatius, recovering from the cannon-ball wound at the Castle of Loyola, Foss says, \"Bored, as only a man of action can be when driven to bed, he was driven by desperation to a few unappetising volumes that the Castle of Loyola offered. He found a Castilian translation of the long, worthy and popular Life of Christ by a certain Ludolph of Saxony, a 14th Century writer.\"Michael Foss (1969), The founding of the Jesuits, 1540, London: Hamilton, p. 92. ==Modern Editions== Father Henry James Coleridge, SJ, a grand-nephew of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in his article of 1872, in the \"Review of Famous Books\" section of The Month, urges future translators of the Vita Christi to be cautious with the Folio edition published by Palme in 1865 since it is marred by poor punctuation, and based on a poor manuscript.Fr Henry James Coleridge (1872), \"Ludolph's Life of Christ\", The Month, Vol. 17 (July\u2013Dec 1872), pp. 337\u2013370 in a footnote on page 342, \"We are sorry to say that the text in the Folio is not so correct as earlier editions. No translator should use it without having one of the latter by his side\u2014this is more to be regretted, as the Editor has taken great pains to multiply the marginal references, and in other ways to make the text more available for use.\" The work has recently been translated into English from the Bodenstedt edition by Milton Walsh and will appear in 2017 from Cistercian Publications. Various portions of the work have been translated over the years. The meditations of the Hours of the Passion were translated by Henry James Coleridge in 1887. The Prologue was translated by Milton Walsh,Milton Walsh, \u201c\u2018To Always be Thinking Somehow about Jesus\u2019: The Prologue of Ludolph\u2019s Vita Christi,\u201d Studies in the Spirituality of Jesuits 43/1 (2011): 1\u201339 and Walsh's translation of the Easter Meditations appeared in 2016 from Cistercian Publications\u201cYour Hearts will Rejoice: Easter Meditations from the Vita Christi of Ludolph of Saxony, Carthusian,\u201d Monastic Wisdom series (Athens, OH: Cistercian Publications, 2016).
