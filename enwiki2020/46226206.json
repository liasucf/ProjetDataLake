    "text": "Jaipur is a card game for two players. It was created by S\u00e9bastien Pauchon in 2009 and published by Asmodee. Players assume the roles of powerful merchants in Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan. The aim is to receive two \"seals of excellence\" and be invited to the court of the Maharaja. The game focuses on buying, exchanging, and selling at better prices, all while keeping an eye on both your camel herds. == Reception == Overall, the board game has received favorable reviews, many acknowledging its simplicity, yet sufficient depth. Shut Up & Sit Down have suggested that \"great game for seasoned vets but also something you could easily introduce to people who don\u2019t play a lot\" whereas iSlayTheDragon said \"Jaipur is a blast to play\". Board Game Land has suggested that the game was \"one of the top card games for couples\". ==Honors== * 2010 Fairplay \u00c0 la carte Winner (Germany) * 2010 Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game Nominee (USA) * 2010 Golden Geek Best Card Game Nominee (USA) * 2010 International Gamers Award - General Strategy: Two-players (Global) * 2010 Lys Grand Public Finalist (France) * 2010 Spiel des Jahres Recommended (Germany) * 2011 Games Magazine Best New Family Card Game Winner (USA) * 2014 Juego del A\u00f1o Winner (Spain)PremioJdA.es: == References == == External links == * Jaipur at BoardGameGeek.
