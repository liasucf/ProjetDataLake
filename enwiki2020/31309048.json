    "text": "Auser Musici is a period instrument ensemble centered in Pisa that specializes in early music repertory from the Tuscan region of Italy. ==History, Mission, and Activities== The ensemble was founded in 1997 by the flautist Carlo Ipata and has performed throughout the continent of Europe, especially in Italy, as well as in the United States. Its concerts feature vocal and instrumental works composed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, frequently including selections from the series Tesori Musicali Toscani, a collection of early music published in Pisa. The home concert venue of Auser Musici is located in the Teatro Giuseppe Verdi of Pisa. The ensemble is named for an ancient river of the Pisan region. Auser Musici has released recordings continuously since the year 1998, presently under exclusive contract with Hyperion Records. In 2010, its recording of flute concertos by Neapolitan composers was singled out by the International Record Review as an Editor\u2019s Choice.See International Record Review (April 2010) with these comments from the reviewer: \u201c\u2026Ipata\u2019s playing is impeccable in both technique and style. His tone is neither whispy and reticent, as characterized by some baroque flautists; I assume the ornamentation in the lovely middle movement of the Jommelli concerto is by him and not written by the composer. If so, it is among the most impressive examples I have heard a soloist perform. The members of Auser Musici play their period instruments with Mediterranean sparkle and wit \u2026\u201d; an issue of Gramophone (April 2010) features these remarks: \u201c\u2026the performances are a delight. What with Ipata\u2019s liquid tone and secure virtuosity, and the brightness, nimbleness and transparency of the one-to-a- part strings of Auser Musici (excellently captured by the recording), this unassuming but funny and attractive music has surely achieved its finest hour.\u201d ). The principal singers who perform regularly with Auser Musici are the sopranos Maria Grazia Schiavo and Elena Cecchi Fedi and the baritone Furio Zanasi. The organization is administered under the direction of Piero Torrigiani and Pierpaolo Corradini. Auser Musici maintains a reciprocal relationship with Musica Toscana of Louisville, Kentucky, another organization devoted to the promotion of music from the Tuscan region of Italy. ==Recordings== *Francesco Barsanti: Sei sonate Op. 2 per flauto traverso, Agor\u00e0 AG 157.1 (1998) *Antonio Brunelli: Fioretti Spirituali, Agor\u00e0 AG 187.1 (1999) *Luigi Boccherini: Giuseppe Riconosciuto, Bongiovanni GB 2298/99-2 (2001) *Pietro Nardini: Overtures and Flute Concertos, Agor\u00e0 Musica AG 157.1 (2002) *Francesco Barsanti: Concerti Grossi, Op. 3 (nos. 1, 4, 6, 7, 10), Tactus Records TC.690201 (2003) *Cristiano Giuseppe Lidarti: Musica da camera e concerto per clavicembalo, Tactus Records TC.733701 (2003) *Francesco Geminiani: Concerti grossi, Op. 2, Symphonia SY 02200 (2003) *Francesco Gasparini: Dori & Daliso \u2013 Mirena & Floro, Symphonia SY 03207 (2004) *Antonio Brunelli: Arie, scherzi, canzonette & madrigali per suonare & cantare, Symphonia SY 04209 (2005) *Luigi Boccherini: Flute Quintets, Op. 19, Hyperion CDA67646 (2008) *Christian Joseph Lidarti: Violin Concertos, Hyperion CDA67685 (2008) *Nicola Porpora: \u201dOr s\u00ec m\u2019aveggio, oh amore\u201d: Cantatas for Soprano, Hyperion CDA67621 (2008) *Antonio Cesti: Le disgrazie d\u2019amore, Hyperion CDA67771 (2010) *Neapolitan Flute Concertos [by Antonio Palella, Genaro Rava, Giuseppe de Majo, Nicol\u00f2 Jommelli, and Tommaso Prota], Hyperion CDA67784 (2010) ==See also== Flute Historically informed performance Baroque music List of early music ensembles ==External links== *http://www.ausermusici.org/ Official website *https://web.archive.org/web/20110723052633/http://www.tesorimusicalitoscani.org/ *https://www.youtube.com/ausermusici * :it:Auser musici ==References== Category:Early music orchestras Category:Italian classical music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1997 ",
