In limited circumstances, the creditors involved in a bankruptcy case can elect a trustee. In a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy (\"Liquidation\") the trustee gathers the debtor's non-exempt property, managing the funds from the sale of those assets, and then paying expenses and distributing the balance to the owed creditors. In a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy (\"Reorganization\") the trustee is responsible for receiving the debtor's monthly payments and distributing those funds proportionally to the debtor's creditors. The Bankruptcy Trustee will act on behalf of the debtor to guarantee that both the creditors\u2019 and the debtor's interests are maintained in accordance with the bankruptcy laws, and will often be required to act as a negotiator between the two parties. Since the 1990s, duties similar to those of a trustee are sometimes performed by an individual called a Chief restructuring officer (CRO), generally prior to, or subsequent to, a bankruptcy proceeding (generally, a Chapter 11 proceeding). A CRO is an official of the company who has direct contact with the creditors and who has executive power to implement changes. The advantage of using a CRO is that the arrangement gives both the creditor and debtor more say over the future of the company than might be the case where a Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee is appointed. == See also == *Receiver (legal) ==References== == External links == *National Association of Bankruptcy Trustees *DOJ U.S. Trustee Program Category:Legal professions Category:United States bankruptcy law Category:Insolvency da:Kurator ",
