Travis first recorded the song at the Radio Recorders Studio B in Hollywood, California, on August 8, 1946. Cliffie Stone played bass on the recording. It was first released in July 1947 by Capitol on Travis's album Folk Songs of the Hills. The song became a gold record. The line \"You load sixteen tons and what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt\" came from a letter written by Travis's brother John. Another line came from their father, a coal miner, who would say: \"I can't afford to die. I owe my soul to the company store.\" A 1955 version recorded by Tennessee Ernie Ford reached number one in the Billboard charts, while another version by Frankie Laine 1956 was released only in Western Europe, where it gave Ford's version competition. On March 25, 2015, Ford's version of the song was inducted into the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry. ==Authorship== The sole authorship of \"Sixteen Tons\" is attributed to Merle Travis on all recordings beginning with Travis's own 1946 record and is registered with BMI as a Merle Travis composition. George S. Davis, a folk singer and songwriter who had been a Kentucky coal miner, claimed on a 1966 recording for Folkways Records to have written the song as \"Nine-to-ten tons\" in the 1930s;John Cohen, liner notes to the album George Davis: When Kentucky Had No Mining Men (Folkways FA 2343, 1967) he also at different times claimed to have written the song as \"Twenty-One Tons\". There is no supporting evidence for Davis's claim. Davis's 1966 recording of his version of the song (with some slightly different lyrics and tune, but titled \"Sixteen Tons\") appears on the albums George Davis: When Kentucky Had No Union MenFolkways FA 2343, 1967 and Classic Mountain Songs from Smithsonian.Folkways Recordings ASIN B000S9DIHK, 2002 According to Travis, the line \"another day older and deeper in debt\" from the chorus was a phrase often used by his father, a coal miner himself. This and the line \"I owe my soul to the company store\" are a reference to the truck system and to debt bondage. Under this scrip system, workers were not paid cash; rather they were paid with non-transferable credit vouchers that could be exchanged only for goods sold at the company store. This made it impossible for workers to store up cash savings. Workers also usually lived in company-owned dormitories or houses, the rent for which was automatically deducted from their pay. In the United States the truck system and associated debt bondage persisted until the strikes of the newly formed United Mine Workers and affiliated unions forced an end to such practices. ==Other versions== Tennessee Ernie Ford recorded \"Sixteen Tons\" in 1955 as the B-side of his cover of the Moon Mullican standard \"You Don't Have to Be a Baby to Cry\". With Ford's snapping fingers and a unique clarinet-driven pop arrangement, it quickly became a million seller. It hit Billboard's country music chart in November and held the No. 1 position for ten weeks, then crossed over and held the number 1 position on the pop music chart for eight weeks, besting the competing version by Johnny Desmond. In the United Kingdom, Ford's version competed with versions by Edmund Hockridge and Frankie Laine. Nevertheless, Ford's version was the most successful, spending four weeks at number 1 in the UK Singles Chart in January and February 1956. Laine's version was not released in the United States but sold well in the UK. Ford's version was released on 17 October, and by 28 October had sold 400,000 copies. On 10 November, a million copies had been sold; two million were sold by 15 December.
