    "text": "In enzymology, a (+)-abscisic acid 8'-hydroxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :(+)-abscisate + NADPH + H + O \\rightleftharpoons 8'-hydroxyabscisate + NADP + HO The four substrates of this enzyme are (+)-abscisate, NADPH, H, and O, whereas its three products are 8'-hydroxy-abscisate, NADP, and HO. This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, to be specific those acting on paired donors, with O as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor. This enzyme participates in carotenoid biosynthesis. == Nomenclature == The systematic name of this enzyme class is abscisate,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (8'-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include * (+)-ABA 8'-hydroxylase and * ABA 8'-hydroxylase. ==References== * * Category:EC 1.14.13 Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes Category:Enzymes of unknown structure ",
