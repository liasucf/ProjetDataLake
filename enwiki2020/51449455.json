    "text": "Certified Blue is the fourteenth studio album by Australian rock band The Black Sorrows. The album was released in April 2014. In an interview in October 2013, Camilleri said \"I think it\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve done in 25 years! But I always say exactly the same thing \u2013 I should have a tape just of me saying that! Nah, I think this record is a pretty special record. You just keep going \u2013 you\u2019ve gotta keep going. People say to me, \u2018why are you making another record? One came out 15 months ago!\u2019 I say, \u2018Because I have to!\u2019 I\u2019ve just gotta do it. That\u2019s what I do \u2013 the money I save on not smoking and not drinking, that\u2019s what I spend it on.\" ==Reception== Scott Podmore from The Herald Sun gave the album 4 out of 5 saying \"Joe and gang are smokin\u2019 in an hour\u2019s worth of songs that insist you move and keep coming back for more.\" Noel Mengel from The Courier Mail gave the album 4.5 out of 5 saying \"[Certified Blue is]..an impeccably crafted trip through all the ingredients that made rock'n'roll in the first place, from gospel to sweet soul, raw blues to country...Blasting Certified Blue in the car, as I have been for a week, I didn't want it to end. It's that good.\" Paul Cashmere from Noise 11 said \"Certified Blue... is a masterpiece.
