The islet is the site of the Leleuvia Island Resort, previously operated by the Chinese-Fijian businessman Emosi Yee Shaw. Only recently in early 2006 has the Island been leased by a Company called Saluwaki Limited with the intention to refurbish the island resort. Leleuvia Island is popular among beachcombers and kite surfers. There is snorkelling directly off the beach. ==External links== *Official Website Category:Islands of Fiji Category:Lomaiviti Province Category:Private islands of Fiji ",
