    "text": "Elmer Crumbley (1 August 1908 \u2013 1993) was an American trombonist. == Biography == Crumbley made a lifetime out of music mainly in the traditional swing tradition, as with the Cab Calloway and Earl Hines bands of the 1960s and '70s. He joined the Dandie Dixie Minstrels in 1926 with bandleader Lloyd Hunter. He played with the George E. Lee Band, western swing pioneer Tommy Douglas, and Bill Owens. But he continued to work with Hunter as well as players such as Jabbo Smith and Erskine Tate. Crumbley founded his own ensemble in Omaha in 1934, and joined up with the Jimmie Lunceford Band the same year. He also played with Eddie Wilcox, Lucky Millinder, and Erskine Hawkins. He toured Europe in the late 1950s with Sammy Price, a period when he also became part of the scene at the Apollo in Harlem with a lively combo led by Reuben Phillips. == References == Category:1908 births Category:1993 deaths Category:American jazz trombonists Category:Male trombonists Category:20th- century trombonists Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:American male jazz musicians ",
