Oh My My became the band's highest-charting debut to date, landing at No. 3 on the Billboard 200. ==Background and composition== Talking to Wonderland Magazine about Oh My My, OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder spoke about what fans could expect from the album: \"Everything \u2013 you could do an entire album on a laptop these days, and some of the biggest records are all electronic laptop driven, and there's a lot of humanity, I think, missing in radio. And so we wanted to make sure that you could actually hear the human beings and the actual instruments that are in the actual songs, so that's the last thing I'll say. It's new and very modern but there's still a big dose of humanity in it because you can actually hear the players.\" In a later interview with Billboard, Tedder revealed that the album took eighteen months to record, which was \"the longest amount of time [the band had] ever spent on one project[...]We did a lot of living in the last four years -- there was a lot to write about.\" On August 25, the band tweeted that the new album was called Oh My My and would come out on October 7, 2016. The artwork for the album was revealed six days later. ==Promotion== OneRepublic has promoted the album at the 2016-2017 NFL Kickoff Concert: in Denver, Colorado, and shows such as The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Today, and The Ellen DeGeneres Show ===Tour=== The band promoted the album on the Honda Civic Tour. ==Singles== The album's official first single, \"Wherever I Go\", was released on May 13, 2016. The song has peaked at number 55 on the Billboard Hot 100 as of July 2016. The second single, \"Kids\", was released on August 12, 2016. In November 2016, the band announced that \"Let's Hurt Tonight\" would be featured on the official soundtrack of the film Collateral Beauty. They later performed the song at the MTV Europe Music Awards. On December 6, 2016, after performing at The Voice, an official video for the song was released on their VEVO channel, featuring some scenes from Collateral Beauty. The song was sent to US Hot AC radio on January 9, 2017.http://playiga.com/track/onerepubliclets-hurt-tonight/ ===Promotional singles=== \"Future Looks Good\" was released as the first promotional single along with the pre-order on September 8, 2016; it was used in the video of Canada/Mexico/United States' bid for 2026 FIFA World Cup. The second promotional single was \"A.I.\", which featured Peter Gabriel, the former frontman of Genesis. ==Commercial performance== Oh My My debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 with 46,000 units, of which 35,000 were traditional album sales. Unlike their two previous albums Waking Up and Native, Oh My My proved not to be a slowburner and left most of the major music markets' charts notably fast, most likely due to the lack of a hit single. Ryan Tedder later addressed the band's absence from promoting the album, citing anxiety and mental fatigue as the key reason. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Adapted from AllMusic. ===OneRepublic=== * Ryan Tedder \u2013 lead vocals, writer, producer, rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, keyboard, tambourine, djembe * Brent Kutzle \u2013 bass guitar, writer, producer, cello, acoustic guitar, keyboard, backing vocals * Zach Filkins \u2013 lead guitar, viola, acoustic guitar, backing vocals * Drew Brown \u2013 rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar, keyboard, glockenspiel, tambourine, backing vocals * Eddie Fisher \u2013 drums, percussion ===Additional personnel=== *Noel Zancanella \u2013 writer, producer, programming *Andrew Foster \u2013 background vocals *Peter Gabriel \u2013 featured artist *Santigold \u2013 featured artist *Cassius \u2013 featured artist *Tyler Spry \u2013 pedal steel, engineer, instrumentation *Robert Stevenson \u2013 arrangement *Riley Bell \u2013 assistant *Jeff Jackson \u2013 assistant * Matthew Tryba \u2013 assistant *David Wise \u2013 assistant *Richard Chappell \u2013 engineer *John Hanes \u2013 engineer *Christopher Henry \u2013 engineer *Mike Piersante \u2013 engineer *Rich Rich \u2013 engineer * Dave Schwerkolt \u2013 engineer *Steve Wilmot \u2013 engineer, vocoder, additional producer *Matt Green \u2013 assistant engineer *Serban Ghenea - mixing *Joe Zook \u2013 mixing *Chris Galland \u2013 mixing *John Hanes \u2013 mixing *Benny Blanco \u2013 producer *Brandon Collins \u2013 producer *MojaveGhst \u2013 producer *Cassius \u2013 additional producer *Katalyst \u2013 additional producer *Zach Skeleton \u2013 additional producer *Robert Stevenson \u2013 vocal producer ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Greek Albums (IFPI Greece) | 26 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |+ List of release dates, showing region, formats, label, editions and reference |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| Edition(s) |- ! scope=\"row\" | Various | October 7, 2016 | | | |} ==References== Category:2016 albums Category:Albums produced by Ryan Tedder Category:OneRepublic albums ",
