    "text": "Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa Londo\u00f1o (born September 30, 1954, Washington, DC) is a Colombian politician. He was mayor of Bogot\u00e1 from 1998 until 2001 and elected again in 2015 for the 2016\u20132019 term. He has also worked as a journalist and consultant on urban and transportation policy. In 2009, Pe\u00f1alosa was elected president of the board of directors of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), a non-profit organization headquartered in New York. Pe\u00f1alosa resigned from the ITDP board in 2015 upon his election. ==Early life and education== Pe\u00f1alosa was born in Washington, DC to Cecilia Londo\u00f1o and Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa Camargo, former Minister of Agriculture at the UN and permanent ambassador for Colombia to the UN. During his childhood, Pe\u00f1alosa studied at Gimnasio Campestre and the Colegio Refous. His family moved to the United States when he was 15 years old for his father's work as the ambassador of Colombia to the UN. He attended Duke University through a partial football scholarship, where he earned a bachelor of arts in Economics and History. ==Entry into politics== Pe\u00f1alosa began his political life by attending the liberal presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan's Youth groups of followers in Bogot\u00e1 while working for the state-owned water supply company, Empresa de Acueducto de Bogot\u00e1 (EAAB). He later supported Julio C\u00e9sar S\u00e1nchez, a Cundinamarca local political chief, who in return, helped him get elected as that department's Deputy. He was later chosen by president Virgilio Barco, a friend of his father, as an economic advisor in 1986. In 1990, he ran for the congressman without the support of any politician and got elected with 22,000 votes. He only remained in that position for a year because the Colombian Congress was closed in the eve of the new Colombian Constitution. However, in those 12 months, he presented many initiatives and managed to pass a reform law, notable for a first-timer congressman. In 1991, he decided to run for mayor of Bogot\u00e1 with the same tactics he used to gain his seat for Congress, without the support of any politicians and just by doing face-to-face contact while touring the city walking, biking or riding on public transportation. He ran against Jaime Castro Castro who ultimately won the election. In 1994, he ran for a second time against Antanas Mockus, who defeated him by a large margin. ==Mayor of Bogot\u00e1 (1998-2000)== In 1997, he ran a third time, now facing Carlos Moreno de Caro winning by a close margin of votes. Pe\u00f1alosa received from Mayor Mockus a city in good fiscal condition and with a District Council that was mostly independent. Pe\u00f1alosa included many of his political friends in his cabinet including long time friend Carlos Alberto Sandoval, who had worked with him in Barco's presidency, who he appointed as Secretary of Economy, and Gilma Jim\u00e9nez in the Family Welfare Institute. Enrique's brother, Gil Pe\u00f1alosa, became Commissioner of Parks. During his mayorship he developed five megaprojects: the bank of lands, the District's system of Parks (including the Bogot\u00e1's Bike Paths Network), the District's system of libraries, the Transmilenio mass transit system, and road construction and maintenance. The impact of Pe\u00f1alosa and Antanas Mockus on the development of Bogot\u00e1 is described in a documentary film released in October 2009 with the title Bogot\u00e1 Change. It is promoted as being \"the story of two charismatic mayors, Antanas Mockus and Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa who, with unorthodox methods, in less than 10 years turned one of the world's most dangerous, violent and corrupt capitals into a model city. Mockus and Pe\u00f1alosa along with key members of their staff as first hand witnesses, the film uncovers the ideas, philosophies and strategies that underlie the changes in Bogot\u00e1 and which are now being exported to cities worldwide\". Throughout the first half of his time as mayor, Pe\u00f1alosa underwent very low approval ratings, even surviving a recall election process mid-term. As public infrastructure projects started to progress, his popularity increased very significantly, such that by the end of his term his approval ratings were some of the highest of any Bogot\u00e1 mayor in recorded history. ===Controversy during his first term=== According to most public analysts in Colombia, Pe\u00f1alosa was the third in a series of three mayors who significantly improved the public conditions in the city of Bogot\u00e1 in the late 1990s. Mayor Jaime Castro finished his term with low popularity, but was able to reform the city's financial structures. This led to a period of budgetary surpluses, which continued during Antanas Mockus term. Mockus began an important change in Bogot\u00e1's civic culture with his Cultura Ciudadana (Citizen Culture) campaign, which encouraged civic behavior and strived to create a sense of belonging for the inhabitants of the city. Pe\u00f1alosa's six biggest policy actions during his first period as mayor included the relocation of informal vendors who occupied the public zones and streets, the improvement of all the city parks and the construction of several new ones, the construction of major public libraries and large public schools in the poorest areas in the city, the renovation of important avenues such as the 15th Avenue and Autopista Norte, the removal of cars from sidewalks by raising them and installing bollards, and starting construction of the first Mass Transit System in Bogot\u00e1, the heavy BRT called TransMilenio, whose construction started under Pe\u00f1alosa to be finished under Antanas Mockus's second term (2001-2003). Some of his policies were unpopular with certain political groups within the city. Among these were his intent to buy the Country Club of Bogot\u00e1 to build a public park, which brought him in conflict with some of the wealthiest neighborhoods in Northern Bogot\u00e1. He also faced problems when he installed bollards along some avenues in highly congested sectors to prevent cars from parking on the sidewalk in front of the buildings and shops. Pe\u00f1alosa also lost popularity, but improved the city's mobility, by introducing the Pico y Placa, a restriction on the rush hour circulation of private vehicles. (Pico y placa roughly translates to \"rush hour and license plate\"; during rush hour licence plates ending with a given number couldn't circulate on a specific days of the week, four ending numbers each day, thus about 40% of the vehicles). The construction of the city's first \"Cicloruta\" (translation for \"Bike route or Bike way\") which are two-way roads that run along some of the city's main avenues, was another great development of the city as an invitation for people to avoid using private motor vehicles, and to provide a cheap and healthy transportation route for those who didn't have access to one. Their construction brought some controversy at first, as the Cicloruta's corridors crossed in front of private houses were in the majority of the cases space was taken from their front sidewalk without their consent and with no remuneration. The legal property documents weren't edited either, which meant that whoever owned the house in front of the sidewalk where the Cicloruta was built, was its actual owner and had to pay taxes on it. For his activities in promoting public transportation, bike use and public space in urban areas in his first term in office, Pe\u00f1alosa was awarded several international sustainability and urban planning awards, and was selected as a distinguished guest in urban policy studies at NYU. Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa Londo\u00f1o at the 2009 Sustainable Transport Awards ===Candidate for a second term as Mayor=== Although he was a possible candidate for the 2010 Colombian presidential election and led the Por el Pais que Queremos Foundation (PPQ), Spanish for \"For the Country we Want\", he chose to run again for mayor in 2007. He was defeated by Alternative Democratic Pole candidate Samuel Moreno by 15 percentage points. In 2011, Pe\u00f1alosa decided to run his candidacy again for the Bogot\u00e1 city hall, but this time, as the official candidate for the Colombian Green Party. He lost the election to Gustavo Petro who won the mayoral race with 32% of the vote against 25% for Pe\u00f1alosa. In 2015 he won the mayoral elections with 33 percent of the vote, defeating former labour minister Rafael Pardo Rueda. ===Presidential candidate=== Pe\u00f1alosa ran for elections in the 2014 presidential election. He represented the Green Party and his Vice Presidential candidate was Isabel Segovia a former Vice Minister of Education. ==Mayor of Bogot\u00e1 (2016-2019)== Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa was elected mayor of Bogot\u00e1 a second time in October 25, 2015, where he won with 906.052 votes and 33.1 percent of the electorate. Even before taking office for his 2016\u20132019 term, Pe\u00f1alosa was subject to low approval ratings similar to those in the first half of his first term as mayor. In 2015 and onwards, politics in Bogot\u00e1 was deeply polarized between Pe\u00f1alosa's center-right policies and leftist populist policies, represented by former mayor Gustavo Petro. Pe\u00f1alosa was the first center-right candidate to be elected as mayor after 12 years of leftist populist politicians in office, with Luis Eduardo Garzon (2004\u20132007), Samuel Moreno Rojas (2008\u20132011) and Gustavo Petro (2012\u20132015). His principal policy proposals in his second administration include the construction of Bogota's first Rapid transit line, to be complemented by several new BRT corridors following Transmilenio's early 2000 plan - including in landmark avenues such as 7th, 68th and Boyac\u00e1 Avenues, the construction of 30 public schools and 6 public hospitals, the implementation of 1.500 surveillance cameras to prevent petty crime, the construction of large highways and avenues such as Avenida Longitudinal de Occidente and Tintal-Alsacia-Constituci\u00f3n, selling all public participation in Empresa de Telefonos de Bogot\u00e1 (ETB), and the expansion of Bogot\u00e1's metropolitan area in its northern edges, in areas currently occupied by the Thomas Van Der Hammen natural reserve. Pe\u00f1alosa has been in controversy with several interest groups for these proposals -specifically environmental, education, and health citizen groups, as well as his political opponents from leftist groups strong in the city. As of late 2017, a recall election attempt on Pe\u00f1alosa is being spearheaded by ETB's unions (who oppose privatization) and Gustavo Petro's political group, supported by other citizen groups. On October 27, 2019, Claudia L\u00f3pez Hern\u00e1ndez, a member of the Green Alliance Party, was elected to succeed Pe\u00f1alosa as mayor of Bogot\u00e1.https://www.losangelesblade.com/2019/10/28/lesbian-elected-mayor-of- colombian-capital/ https://thecitypaperbogota.com/news/claudia-lopez-elected- mayor-of-bogota-and-first-woman-to-govern-colombias-capital/23027 Democratic Center candidate Miguel Uribe Turbay, who served Pe\u00f1alosa's Secretary-General, came in fourth place during the election.https://thecitypaperbogota.com/news/claudia-lopez-elected-mayor-of- bogota-and-first-woman-to-govern-colombias-capital/23027 ===Graduate degrees scandal=== Penalosa's critics have recently claimed that he has repeatedly misstated his professional graduate studies throughout his career. Pe\u00f1alosa claims he earned a Dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es (DESS) at the University of Paris. In response to these allegations, he has claimed that this DESS title has been repeatedly misinterpreted as a PhD. Further investigation into his studies revealed that he earned a graduate degree in Government Affairs at the University of Paris II, and later earning a DESS at the Institut international d\u2019administration publique (also known as \u00c9cole nationale de la France d'outre-mer), which in 2002 was merged into \u00c9cole nationale d'administration. The scandal was triggered in 2016 by an opinion article published in the Colombian newspaper El Espectador, which reported in April 2016 that Pe\u00f1alosa did not hold a doctoral degree as had been widely reported by several sources, including in the personal profile section in several of his published books. Opinion writers in El Espectador discovered that Pe\u00f1alosa did not hold a doctoral degree, after contacting the University of Paris which confirmed that it did not offer any academic program that would grant a PhD in Public Administration. The magazine Semana also reported that during the swearing-in ceremony of the Mayor on January 2016, a leaflet had been circulated among news media that presented Pe\u00f1alosa as a PhD of Public Administration, which the mayor dismissed as typing errors by someone in his team. According to an opposition group actively promoting Pe\u00f1alosa's 2015 election to be recalled, Pe\u00f1alosa has been misrepresenting his graduate degrees for 35 years. The group denounced that in an interview with the Brazilian newspaper O Globo, Pe\u00f1alosa had directly stated that he held a PhD in public administration, however only the edited interview was ever published, and given the differences between the Spanish and Portuguese languages, other proof of this statement remained unverified, including a direct statement from the lead reporter of said interview. Pe\u00f1alosa himself has repeatedly claimed that he has never mentioned in public that he has a PhD degree, and that he firmly believes that his two graduate degrees earned in France are equivalent to master's degrees in the Colombian education system, while stating that his political opponents are actively trying to tarnish his academic credentials with unsubstantiated attacks while promoting his election to be recalled. In his first term as mayor, Pe\u00f1alosa also went through a significant Recall election attempt by his political opponents. According to Pe\u00f1alosa's official public curriculum vitae presented to Colombian authorities when elected as mayor, Pe\u00f1alosa holds a bachelor's degree in Economics and History (Earned in May, 1977), a Master's in Government Affairs (Earned in September, 1979) and a \"third cycle graduate title in Public Management\", referring to the DESS title (Earned in September, 1980). ==Awards== * Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Journalism Award 1986 for his economy related journalism section in El Espectador newspaper. * Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Journalism Award 1990 for his documentary Capitalismo, la mejor opci\u00f3n. ==Bibliography== ===Books=== * Capitalismo: \u00bfLa mejor opci\u00f3n? * Democracia y Capitalismo: retos para el pr\u00f3ximo siglo ===Documentaries=== * Capitalismo, la mejor opci\u00f3n (documentary) (1990) ===Articles=== He has written articles for El Tiempo, Nueva Frontera, Econom\u00eda Colombiana, Carta Financiera and Revista Diners. ===Conferences=== * Holcim Forum 2007 of the Holcim Foundation, ==References== * ==External links== * * * * * CV page in English * Institute for Transportation and Development Policy |- Category:1954 births Category:Colombian Liberal Party politicians Category:Duke University Trinity College of Arts and Sciences alumni Category:Living people Category:Mayors of Bogot\u00e1 Category:Members of the Chamber of Representatives of Colombia Category:People from Washington, D.C.
