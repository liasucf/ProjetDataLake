While this provides a smooth transit at international borders to countries of the former Soviet Union, the railway in China has the standard gauge of ; thus there is a break-of-gauge at Dostyk and at Khorgas/Altynkol. KTZ controls about track (2005) which is being expanded. The Kazakhstan sections of the old Trans-Aral Railway, the Trans-Caspian railway, and the Turkestan-Siberia Railway have been incorporated into the KTZ. 3000 km are electrified at 25 kV 50 Hz AC. == Operation == KTZ is the largest employer in Kazakhstan with about 143,000 employees (2008).CBonds: Moody's places KTZ's and Kaztemirtrans' ratings on review for possible downgrade It manages over 80,000 wagons, 50,000 of them state-owned, and the remainder in private hands.

Current rail transport between China and Europe as part of the Eurasian Land Bridge goes over the Trans-Siberian railway, is lengthy, and requires bogie exchanges. KTZ is engaging on a major railroad project to link China and Southeast Asia to Europe for a length of . Currently the plan is to run the railway through Turkmenistan to Iran; Iran is linked to Turkey and Europe's standard gauge systemTKTR project In May 2013, a new rail link opened between Uzen (Kazakhstan) and Serhetyaka (Turkmenistan), crossing the border at Bolashak. The railway is 146 km long and cost 65bn tenge. The railway is Russian gauge; there would be a break of gauge when the railway reaches the Iranian border. Construction for the new line will start at the eastern border town of Druzhba to go to Aktau on the Caspian Sea. Construction is expected to start in 2006 and take four years. The total cost of the project is $5\u20137 billion.TKTR project A link from Aktau to Iran is also required. The transport corridor through Kazakhstan has the potential to provide a railway-ship link between China and the east coast of North America through the Northern East West corridor.* Northern East West Corridor === Railway links with adjacent countries === * Russia \u2013 same gauge (former Soviet Union railway system) * China \u2013 break of gauge /; border stations at Druzhba (connecting to Alashankou on the Lanxin railway) and at Korgas. * Kyrgyzstan \u2013 same gauge (former Soviet Union railway system) * Uzbekistan \u2013 same gauge (former Soviet Union railway system) * Turkmenistan \u2013 same gauge (former Soviet Union railway system) \u2013 new rail link opened in 2013. == Rolling stock == In October 2010, Kazakhstan Temir Zholy ordered 295 KZ8A electric locomotives from Alstom, for both freight and passenger services.
