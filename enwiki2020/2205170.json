Together they had three daughters \u2013 Saleha, Sabiha, and Qudsia - and a son, the cricketer Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi.

In 1960, upon the death of her father, she became titular ruler of Bhopal. Her older sister, Abida, was the heiress apparent to the title but had emigrated to Pakistan in 1950 and declined to return to Bhopal permanently; her son declined also. Sajida was formally recognised as the Nawab Begum of Bhopal in 1962, with recognition being effective from 1960. She died on 5 September 1995 at the age of 80.
