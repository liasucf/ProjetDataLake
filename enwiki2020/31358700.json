    "text": "Arequipa-Antofalla is a basement unit underlying the central Andes in northwestern Argentina, western Bolivia, northern Chile and southern Peru. Geologically, it corresponds to a craton, terrane or block of continental crust. Arequipa-Antofalla collided and amalgamated with the Amazonian craton about 1000 Ma ago during the Suns\u00e1s orogeny. As a terrane Arequipa-Antofalla was ribbon-shaped during the Paleozoic, a time when it was bounded by the west by the Iapetus Ocean and by the east by the Puncoviscana Ocean. == References == Category:Cratons Category:Geology of Argentina Category:Geology of Bolivia Category:Geology of Chile Category:Geology of Peru Category:Terranes Category:Precambrian South America Category:Geology of the Andes ",
