She is best known for her viral Dubsmash videos and her role as Yaya Dub in the noontime variety show Eat Bulaga! segment \"Kalyeserye\", previously aired on GMA Network and worldwide via GMA Pinoy TV. Her rise to fame is often described as phenomenal and unconventional due to the unscripted forming of AlDub love team in Eat Bulaga! on July 16, 2015 where she was paired with Alden Richards. AlDub is a portmanteau of Richards' first name and Mendoza's character in \"Kalyeserye\". Beyond Eat Bulaga!, Mendoza featured in the 2015 film My Bebe Love: #KiligPaMore, for which she won Best Supporting Actress at the 41st Metro Manila Film Festival. She was the lead actress in the 2016 film Imagine You & Me, where she also wrote and sang its theme song. Mendoza has a passion for writing, having been a blogger even before she entered show business. In October 2017, she released her first autobiographical book entitled Yup, I Am That Girl., which is an unfiltered version of her personal blog Pessimistic Optimist Bella. ==Early life== Maine Mendoza was born on March 3, 1995 in Santa Maria, Bulacan, Philippines to Mary Ann and Teodoro Mendoza.
