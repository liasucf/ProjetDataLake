    "text": "The X167 Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class is a third generation full-size luxury SUV and began production in October of 2019. It replaces the Mercedes-Benz GL- Class/GLS-Class (X166). The new X167 is developed to be \"the S-Class of SUVs\" in mind, offering the luxurious equipment. == Development and launch == The third generation X167 GLS-Class debuted at the 2019 New York International Auto Show. It is launched in October 2019 in the United States and at the end of 2019 for Europe and rest of the world. The X167 is 7.7 cm longer and 2.2 cm wider than X166 for greater driving and riding comfort. The wheelbase is 6 cm longer, which improves the body proportion and interior space for the second row seats. Additionally, X167 GLS-Class is first SUV from Mercedes-Benz to have fully electrically-adjustable three rows of seats and to offer the optional six-seat configuration with captain seats for second row. The second and third row seats can be folded electrically flat with a touch of a button. == Equipment == The MULTIBEAM LED headlamp system with total of 112 LED bulbs per headlamp are fitted as standard along with daytime running lights containing three LED segments. The optional extra-charge Rear Seat Comfort Package Plus has Android tablet fitted to the second row centre armrest: the tablet allows the second row passengers to access MBUX comfort and entertainment functions as well as five-level climate control. The controls can be overridden by the driver if wished. The new instrument cluster has two large 31.2 cm screens side-by-side for displaying and accessing the latest generation of MBUX (Mercedes-Benz User Experience) to control many functions by touchscreen, trackpad, switches and buttons on steering wheel, or by hand gestures. The extra-charge options for reducing the driving fatigue, especially over the long distance, are Acoustical-Comfort Package that acoustically cancels the noise within the interior and Energizing Package and Energizing Package Plus that use artificial intelligence to manage the maximal driving comfort and attention. The suspension system uses the Airmatic air suspension system carried over from X166. For greater driving comfort, the optional E-Active Body Control suspension can counteract body roll, pitching, and squat by controlling individually spring and damping forces individually at each wheel. E-Active Body Control uses the road surface scan and curve inclination functions to determine the best suspension configuration. == Models == ===Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600 4MATIC=== A first Maybach version of GLS-Class, GLS 600 4MATIC, was unveiled at 2019 Guangzhou International Motor Show on 21 November 2019. The engine is a detuned version of the M177 V8 Biturbo found in the Mercedes-AMG GLS 63 4MATIC+, but with a 48-Volt mild hybrid system. Although Mercedes-Benz has registered both GLS 600 4MATIC and GLS 680 4MATIC nomenclatures, the latter was designated exclusively to the Chinese market due to the auspicious nature of number 8, closely associated with luck and wealth, as the manufacturer has done with Mercedes-Maybach S 680 (known as the S 650 in other markets). The GLS 600 4MATIC isn't based on the Mercedes-Maybach Vision Ultimate Luxury concept vehicle shown at 2018 Shanghai Motor Show. This version is the first time that a three-point star stand-up ornament affixed to the hood/bonnet on a SUV rather than the large \"jet- engine\" three-point star filling up the grill space as found in every SUV from Mercedes-Benz since 1979. ===Mercedes-AMG GLS 63 4MATIC+=== The second generation AMG version of the GLS-Class, GLS 63 S 4MATIC+, was introduced at the same time as Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600 4MATIC. The 4.0-litre M177 V8 Biturbo is rated at , making the GLS 63 4MATIC+ the most powerful GLS ever. The novel feature is the \"reintroduction\" of classical AMG monoblock alloy wheels, which were popular option in the 1980s and 1990s. Due to its large size and poor environmental record, Environmental Action Germany nominated the car for their Goldener Geier (Golden Vulture) 2020 award. ===Engines (2019\u2013present) === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Model!!Years!!Configuration!!Displacement!!Power!!Torque!!0\u2013100 km/h (0-62 mph)!!Top Speed!!Fuel Consumption/Efficiency (EU-Norm combined) |- ! colspan=\"9\" style=\"text-align:center\"|Petrol Engines |- |GLS 450 4MATIC |10/2019\u2013present |Inline-6 biturbo (M 256 E30 DEH LA G R) + 48V Mild Hybrid EQ Boost |3.0 L (2,999 cc) | at 5,900-6,100 rpm (Engine) / (Electric) | (Engine) / (Electric) |6.2 seconds | | (USA) |- |GLS 580 4MATIC |10/2019\u2013present |V8 biturbo (M176) + 48V Mild Hybrid EQ Boost |4.0 L (3,982 cc) | at 5,900-6,100 rpm (Engine) / (Electric) | (Engine) / (Electric) |5.3 seconds | | |- |Maybach GLS 600 4MATIC |2020\u2013present |V8 biturbo (M177) + 48V Mild Hybrid EQ Boost |4.0 L (3,982 cc) | at 6,000\u20136,500 rpm (Engine) / (Electric) | (Engine) / (Electric) |4.9 seconds | | |- |AMG GLS 63 4MATIC+ |2020\u2013present |V8 biturbo (M177) + 48V Mild Hybrid EQ Boost |4.0 L (3,982 cc) | at 6,000\u20136,500 rpm (Engine) / (Electric) | (Engine) / (Electric) |4.2 seconds | / with optional Driver's Package | |- ! colspan=\"9\" style=\"text- align:center\"|Diesel engines |- |GLS 350 d 4MATIC |10/2019\u2013present |Inline-6 biturbo (OM 656 D 29 R SCR) + 48V Mild Hybrid EQ Boost |2.9 L (2,925 cc) | at 3,400\u20134,600 rpm | at 1,200\u20133,200 rpm |7.0 seconds | | |- |GLS 400 d 4MATIC |10/2019\u2013present |Inline-6 biturbo (OM 656 D 29 R SCR) + 48V Mild Hybrid EQ Boost |2.9 L (2,925 cc) | at 3.600-4.200 rpm | at 1.200-3.200 rpm |6.3 seconds | | |- |} Rear view === Transmission (2019\u2013present)=== {| class=wikitable |- !Model!!Years!!Types |- |GLS 450 4MATIC||10/2019\u2013present||9-speed automatic 9G-TRONIC |- |GLS 580 4MATIC||10/2019\u2013present||9-speed automatic 9G-TRONIC |- |AMG GLS 63 4MATIC+||2020\u2013present||9-speed automatic 9G-TRONIC AMG SPEEDSHIFT |- |Maybach GLS 600 4MATIC||2020\u2013present||9-speed automatic 9G-TRONIC |- |GLS 350 d 4MATIC||10/2019\u2013present||9-speed automatic 9G-TRONIC |- |GLS 400 d 4MATIC||10/2019\u2013present||9-speed automatic 9G-TRONIC |- |} ==References== == External links == * GLS-Class (X167) Category:Cars introduced in 2019 Category:Luxury sport utility vehicles Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles Category:2020s cars ",
