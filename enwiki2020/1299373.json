Ingerman and Rotrude had one daughter: * Ermengarde. She married into the Frankish royal family, the Carolingians and was the first wife of King Louis the Pious, Son of Charlemagne. ==Primary sources mentioning Ingoram== There seems to be only one primary source directly mentioning Ingoram. In a medieval life story of Emperor Louis the Pious, by Thegan of Trier, Louis's wife Ermengarde is said to be a daughter of the noble duke Ingorammus, who was son of a brother of Hruotgangi \"sancti pontificis\".MGH SS II p.591 This in turn is believed to refer to Saint Chrodegang, the Bishop of Metz. Chrodegang in turn was named in one medieval record as having parents who were nobles from Hasbania (Hesbaye).Gesta Episcoporum Mettensis MGH SS II, p.267. ==References== ==Sources== * Category:Counts of Hesbaye Category:8th- century Frankish nobility Category:750s births Category:818 deaths Category:Year of birth uncertain ",
