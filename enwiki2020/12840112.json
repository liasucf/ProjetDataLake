Like his older brother and predecessor, Enrico, he had learning difficulties and was the titular pretender of Parma from 1939 until 1950. His younger brother and successor, Elias, took up the role as head of the family in 1907 and acted as regent, although Giuseppe continued to be considered by monarchists as Joseph I of Parma. Giuseppe died unmarried and without issue and was succeeded as titular pretender of Parma by his brother Elias upon his death in 1950. ==Ancestry== ==See also== *Duchy of Parma *House of Bourbon-Parma Category:Pretenders to the throne of Parma Category:Regents of Parma Category:Dukes of Parma Category:Princes of Bourbon- Parma Category:Princes of Parma and Piacenza Joseph I Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece Joseph I of Parma Joseph I of Parma ",
