It is likely associated with the Bell Beaker culture and, possibly, the Celts. This haplogroup is found among an absolute majority of the male inhabitants of Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Brittany; is also found at significant levels in England, Northern France, and north-west Iberia (Northern Portugal Galicia and Asturias). It is found at lower levels in Belgium and the Netherlands. DF13 is ancestral to many subclades commonly found in the above areas, including: R-L513/S215/DF1, R-L1335, R-Z253, R-ZZ10, R-Z251, R-Z255/S219, and R-FGC33712/FGC33755. == References == == External links == ",
