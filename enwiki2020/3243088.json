    "text": "Phil \"Philth\" Ondich is an American drummer from near Mansfield, Ohio. In 1997, Ondich was playing in hard rock band Raging Slab. Having met Zakk Wylde several times while he was touring for his 1996 solo record Book of Shadows, the two agreed to work together on a project Wylde had been planning. Ondich became a founding member of Wylde's Black Label Society in 1998, and played on their first two albums before exiting the band in July 2000. During his time with Black Label Society, Ondich endorsed Pearl Drums and Pro-Mark Sticks. Much of the artwork that Black Label Society still uses today was created by Ondich when he was with the band. In 2001, Ondich was featured on Raging Slab's album The Dealer, although his drum tracks were recorded before he left the band in 1998. When Slab frontman Greg Strzempka was asked about this in his Metal Sludge 20 Questions interview, he responded with \"...as far as the tracks on the new record- Phil is an EXCELLENT drummer...and the songs he recorded with us were really good -and when you've NAILED it- why do it again?\" \"Metal Sludge - 20 Questions With Greg Strzempka, 9/25/01\", Metal Sludge website, accessed June 15, 2007. ==Discography== * With Black Label Society **Sonic Brew (1999) **Stronger Than Death (2000) **Kings of Damnation 98\u201304 (2005; on tracks 5, 8, and 9) **Nuns and Roaches \u2013 Tasty Little Bastards (2019) *With Kansas City Bastards **Alcoholic Superman (2012)\"Kansas City Bastards - Alcoholic Superman (featuring Phil Ondich and Gil Cole)\", Youtube, accessed March 25, 2013. *With L.I.E. **Die Trying (2005; title track only) *With Raging Slab **The Dealer (2001; on tracks \"Real Good Time\", \"The Ballad of Truly Mae\", \"Roadless Rider\", and \"That Ain't What I Meant\") ==References== Category:American heavy metal drummers Category:Musicians from Ohio Category:Living people Category:American rock drummers Category:Black Label Society members Category:Raging Slab members Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
