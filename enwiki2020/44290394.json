    "text": "Francis Bashforth (8 January 1819, in Thurnscoe, Yorkshire - 12 February 1912, in Woodhall Spa, Lincolnshire) was a British applied mathematician who studied ballistics. Bashforth studied mathematics at the University of Cambridge, where he was Second Wrangler (second highest-scoring candidate) in the 1843 Tripos examination. Later he was a fellow at St. John's College, Cambridge. He was ordained in the Anglican Church. From 1857 until 1892, he was the school rector at Minting in Lincolnshire. Between 1864 and 1880 he undertook some systematic ballistics experiments that studied the resistance of air. He invented a ballistic chronograph. He received an award from the British government in the amount of \u00a32000 (). stating, \"Lord Hartington, Secretary of State for War, when he conferred the government award of \u00a32000, in 1885, fully recognised the value of the services rendered by me to the War Department (315).\" See also note 315 on page 54. At times, he was also a professor of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He also studied liquid drops and surface tension. The Adams\u2013Bashforth method (a numerical integration method) is named after John Couch Adams (who was the 1847 Senior Wrangler) and Bashforth. They used the method to study drop formation in 1883. == Writings == * * * * * * * ==References== * ==External links== *https://books.google.com/books?id=gO4pAAAAYAAJ&pg;=PA42&lpg;=PA42&hl;=en&sa;=X&f;=false states \"Second Wrangler 1843\", \"Rector and Vicar of Minting\". *http://armiestrumenti.com/2010/11/03/introduzione-alla-balistica-esterna/ (Italian); has picture of Bashforth *This article was translated from the corresponding article in the German Wikipedia.
