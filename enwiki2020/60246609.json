    "text": "Marjolein Dijkstra (born 1967) is a Dutch condensed matter physicist. She works as a professor in the Debye Institute for NanoMaterials Science at Utrecht University, and the Soft Condensed Matter group of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Utrecht. ==Education and career== Dijkstra was born on 26 September 1967 in The Hague. She earned two master's degrees, one in chemical engineering in 1990 from Wageningen University under the supervision of Yehudi K. Levine and Tjeerd Schaafsma, and another in experimental physics in 1990 from Utrecht University under the supervision of Daan Frenkel. She completed her Ph.D. in 1994, with Frenkel as her doctoral advisor. Her dissertation was The effect of entropy on the structure and stability of complex fluids. After postdoctoral research at the University of Oxford with Paul Madden and Jean-Pierre Hansen, at the Shell Research and Technology Centre Amsterdam, and at Bristol University with Michael P. Allen and Robert Evans, she joined the Utrecht faculty in 1999. She has been a full professor there since 2007, and was named director of the Debye Institute in 2015. ==Recognition== Dijkstra won the Minerva Prize of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research in 2000. This prize is given every two years for outstanding research by a female physicist; Dijkstra won it for her work with Ren\u00e9 van Roij and Robert Evans on \"Phase diagram of highly asymmetric binary hard-sphere mixtures\". Dijkstra was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2020. ==References== ==External links== *Home page * Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Dutch physicists Category:Dutch women physicists Category:Condensed matter physicists Category:Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences Category:Utrecht University alumni Category:Utrecht University faculty Category:Wageningen University and Research alumni ",
