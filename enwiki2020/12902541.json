Built in 1911\u201312, it is one of only two New Hampshire bridges (along with the Mount Orne Covered Bridge) built with Howe trusses, and is one of the last covered bridges built in the historic era of covered bridge construction in both states. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. ==Description and history== The Columbia Bridge stands in southeastern Lemington and northwestern Columbia, both rural communities in the northern parts of their respective states. It carries Columbia Bridge Road between United States Route 3 in New Hampshire and Vermont Route 102 in Vermont. It is in a rural agricultural setting, and is oriented northwest-to-southeast across the Connecticut River, on abutments of dry laid stone that have been faced in concrete. It is a wood-iron Howe truss design, with a single span that is long. The bridge has a total width of and a roadway with of , and an internal clearance of . The exterior is sheathed in vertical board siding, which extends a short way into each portal to protect the truss ends. The siding on the north side rises to a height of , leaving an open space between it and the gabled roof. The bridge was built by Charles Babbitt in 1912, replacing one destroyed by fire the previous year, and is the third to stand on the site. The bridge is considered to be one of the last built in either state during the historic period of covered bridge construction. It was rehabilitated by the state of New Hampshire in 1981 at a cost of $143,000. == See also == * List of crossings of the Connecticut River * List of covered bridges in New Hampshire * List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire * National Register of Historic Places listings in Co\u00f6s County, New Hampshire * List of covered bridges in Vermont * List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Vermont * National Register of Historic Places listings in Essex County, Vermont ==References== == External links == * *Columbia Bridge, NH Division of Historical Resources Category:Covered bridges in Vermont Category:Covered bridges in New Hampshire Category:Buildings and structures in Lemington, Vermont Category:Bridges over the Connecticut River Category:Bridges completed in 1912 Category:Covered bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire Category:Covered bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Vermont Category:Tourist attractions in Coos County, New Hampshire Category:Bridges in Coos County, New Hampshire Category:Bridges in Essex County, Vermont Category:Tourist attractions in Essex County, Vermont Category:Road bridges in New Hampshire Category:Road bridges in Vermont Category:1912 establishments in New Hampshire Category:National Register of Historic Places in Coos County, New Hampshire Category:National Register of Historic Places in Essex County, Vermont Category:Road bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire Category:Road bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Vermont Category:Wooden bridges in New Hampshire Category:Wooden bridges in Vermont Category:Howe truss bridges in the United States Category:1912 establishments in Vermont Category:Interstate vehicle bridges in the United States ",
