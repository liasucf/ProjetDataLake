Edward Digby, son of William Digby, 5th Baron Digby. His mother was Charlotte Fox, daughter of Sir Stephen Fox and sister of Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland. He was a close connection of the Foxes, and from 1744 on regularly attended their annual shooting-party in Wiltshire. On 13 June 1751, he was returned at Malmesbury on Henry Fox's interest after the death of James Douglas. Around this time, he was appointed a Groom of the Bedchamber to George, Prince of Wales. On 27 November 1752, he succeeded his grandfather William as Baron Digby, an Irish peerage which did not oblige him to vacate his seat in the Commons. He resigned his bedchamber office in 1753 as a result of his succession, by which he inherited Sherborne Castle in Dorset. Digby intended to contest Dorset, where he had large estates, in the next general election and asked for the support of the Duke of Newcastle, but when George Trenchard nominated him at the county meeting of gentlemen in August 1753, there was no enthusiasm for his candidacy and he dropped the plan. Instead, Fox had him returned for Wells at the 1754 election on a joint interest with Charles Tudway. As befitted a connection of Fox, Digby was a Whig, but took relatively little interest in politics. His health was poor, and he hoped to obtain a higher peerage, either a British title or an Irish earldom, an object left unfulfilled. In 1756, he was operated on for kidney stones by Dr. Adair Hawkins. He survived the surgery, but the wound was slow to heal, and he was left an invalid until he died on 30 November 1757. Digby was known for acts of great benevolence. In particular, he was known to visit the Marshalsea Debtors' prison at least twice annually, at Christmas and Easter, and each time secure the release of a number of prisoners by paying off their debts. He would then take the newly freed individuals to George Inn in Borough for dinner.The Penny Story-Teller, 2 January 1833. Digby never married and was succeeded in the barony by his younger brother Henry, who was created Earl Digby in 1790. ==References== Category:1730 births Category:1757 deaths Category:Barons in the Peerage of Ireland Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:British MPs 1747\u20131754 Category:British MPs 1754\u20131761 Category:Whig (British political party) MPs Edward ",
