    "text": "Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (also known as TJHSST, TJ, or Jefferson) is a Virginia state-chartered magnet school in Fairfax County, Virginia. It is a regional high school operated by Fairfax County Public Schools. In its 2019 report evaluating almost 18,000 public high schools, U.S. News & World Report ranked TJ as the best overall high school in the United States. Attendance at the school is open to students in six local jurisdictions based on prior academic achievement, recommendations, and essays. TJ removed its admissions test in 2020. The selective admissions program was initiated in 1985 through the cooperation of state and county governments, as well as corporate sponsorship from the defense and technology industries. The school occupies the building of the previous Thomas Jefferson High School (constructed in 1965). It is one of 18 Virginia Governor's Schools, and a founding member of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology. In 2016, the school placed first in Newsweek's annual \"America's Top High Schools\" rankings for the third consecutive year and fifth in US News & World Report's 2016 High School Rankings. == Students == In 2015 and 2016, the ratio of acceptances to applications was 17% and 17.9%, respectively. The ethnic demographics of the students admitted in the graduating class of 2022 was 65.2% Asian/Asian American, 22.9% Caucasian/white American, 5.1% other (including people of Native American, Pacific Islander, and multiple racial backgrounds), 4.7% Hispanic or Latino American, and 2.1% African American or black. Hispanic and black students make up less than seven percent of student body, while the same groups constitute about thirty percent of the student population in the area. In 2012, a civil rights complaint against the school was filed with the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights by Coalition of the Silence, an advocacy group led by former county School Board member Tina Hone, and the Fairfax chapter of the NAACP. In response, the Office of Civil Rights, in September 2012, opened an investigation. The school is part of the Fairfax County Public Schools system of Fairfax County, Virginia. Students from Fairfax, Arlington, Loudoun, and Prince William counties and from the City of Falls Church are also eligible for admission. == Awards and distinctions == In 2016, the school placed first in Newsweek's annual \"America's Top High Schools\" rankings for the third consecutive year. Previously, it ranked 8th in the 2013 rankings and 10th in the 2012 rankings, the first year it was included. It was ranked fourth in \"America's Best High Schools\" by U.S. News and World Report in 2019. In the same rankings, it placed third in 2018, sixth in 2017, fifth in 2016, third in 2015, fourth in 2014 and 2013, and second in 2012 and 2011. The average SAT scores for various graduating classes has consistently been above 2150. The school had 14 Intel Science Talent Search Semifinalists in 2007, 15 in 2009, and 13 in 2010. In 2007, for schools with more than 800 students in grades 10\u201312, TJ was cited as having the highest- performing AP Calculus BC, AP Chemistry, AP French Language, AP Government and Politics, U.S., and AP U.S. History courses among all schools worldwide.http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/about/news_info/ap/2007/2007_ap- report-nation.pdf In 2014, 3864 AP Exams were taken by students; over 97% earned a score of 3, 4, or 5. President Barack Obama signed the America Invents Act into law on September 16, 2011 at the school. The law was made to reform U.S. patent laws. === Renovation === The school underwent renovation, completed in April 2017, for a cost of about $89 million, including $67.4 million for construction. A replica of Thomas Jefferson's Monticello dome graces the school's entrance, colloquially known as \"The Dome\" by students and staff. The renovation overhauled the school's aging facilities, many of which had not been updated since it was built in 1964. As of April 2017, renovations have completed, including the improvement of various science and technology laboratories. == Notable alumni == * Chris Avellone, game designer * Sandra Beasley, poet * Bob Bland, fashion designer and activist * Ian Caldwell, author * Lisa Desjardins, political journalist * Mike Elias, baseball executive * Mark Embree, Rhodes Scholar * Eric Froehlich, World Series of Poker * Stephanie Hannon, CTO of Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016 * Darius Kazemi, programmer, artist, and co-founder of Feel Train * Andrew Kirmse, game developer and computer programmer * Ehren Kruger, screenwriter * Christo Landry, professional long-distance runner * Howard Lerman, entrepreneur * George Little, former Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs. * Jose Llana, actor * Ashley Miller, screenwriter * Aparna Nancherla, comedian * Amna Nawaz, broadcast journalist * Thao Nguyen, vocalist * Michael H.

Orbital Sciences Corporation donated the CubeSat Kit to the school on December 6, 2006 and provided the launch for the satellite. After a successful launch at 8:15PM, TJ3SAT became the first satellite launched into space that was built by high school students. The launched satellite contained a 4-watt transmitter operating on amateur radio frequencies, and a text-to-speech module to allow it to broadcast ASCII-encoded messages sent to it from Jefferson. === Computer Systems Lab === Linux mascot. The school's computer systems lab is one of the few high school computing facilities with a supercomputer. In 1988, a team from the school won an ETA-10P supercomputer in the SuperQuest competition, a national science competition for high school students. The ETA-10P was damaged by a roof leak in the 1990s. Cray Inc. donated a new SV1 supercomputer, known as Seymour, to the school on December 4, 2002, which is on display as of 2020.https://documentation.tjhsst.edu/machines/obsolete/cray-sv1-supercomputer The lab also supported a number of Sun Microsystems thin clients for use by students enrolled in AP Computer Science. In 2008, the school received a grant from Sun Microsystems for $388,048, which was student- written.https://livedoc.tjhsst.edu/index.php?title=Sun_Academic_Excellence_Grant_(AEG)#Overview The Syslab was given 7 Sun workstations, 12 Sun servers, and 145 Sun Rays for distribution throughout the school. These were placed in the existing AP Computer Science Lab and the science classrooms, support backend services, and serve as kiosks placed around the school for guests, students, and faculty. However, the Sun Rays were taken out of the AP Computer Science Lab due to teachers' objections. By 2014, the Sun Ray clients were decommissioned, and replaced with Linux-based thin clients running LTSP. Since 2000, students have built and maintained an Intranet application used to give students access to school resources remotely, and to manage the Eighth Period program. Three iterations of the application have been developed: the original system, built in 2000 as an early PHP application; Intranet2, known as Iodine, which used object-oriented PHP; and Ion, written in Python using the Django web framework.https://livedoc.tjhsst.edu/wiki/Intranet2https://ion.tjhsst.edu/about === Arts === In 1997, 2000, 2013, and 2017, the wind ensemble of the school was among fifteen high-school bands invited to the Music for All National Concert Band Festival in Indianapolis. == References == == Further reading == * Lindsey, Drew. \"Success Factory: Inside America\u2019s Best High School\", Washingtonian, October 1, 2009.
