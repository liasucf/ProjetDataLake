He took the college oath on 27 January 1668\u20139, and was ordained as a secular priest on 16 April 1672. He was admitted into the Society of Jesus at Rome, by the father- general, Oliva, on 4 January 1673 \u2013 1674, and left for Watten to make his noviceship on 5 April or 4 June 1674. He was professed of the four vows on 15 August 1684. A catalogue of the members of the society, drawn up in 1693, states that he took the degree of D.D. at Cologne, and had been prefect of studies and vice-rector of the college at Li\u00e8ge, and of the \"College of St. Ignatius, London.\" He was appointed confessor to the exiled king, James II, at Saint-Germain, and attended that monarch during his last illness. He died at Saint-Germain on 19 February 1709\u201310. The jesuit father, Fran\u00e7ois Bretonneau, published \u2018\"Abr\u00e9g\u00e9 de la Vie de Jacques II, Roy de la Grande Bretagne, &c.; Tir\u00e9 d'un \u00e9crit Anglois du R. P. Fran\u00e7ois Sanders, de la Compagnie de Jesus, Confesseur de Sa Majest\u00e9,\" Paris, 1703, 12mo. This appeared in English, under the title of: \"An Abridgment of the Life of James II \u2026 extracted from an English Manuscript of the Reverend Father Francis Sanders \u2026 done out of French from the Paris edition,\" London, 1704. An Italian translation was published at Milan in 1703, and at Ferrara in 1704; and a Spanish translation, by Francesco de Medyana y Vargas, appeared at Cadiz in 1707, 4to.
