    "text": "\"Lean On\" is a song recorded by Jamaican-American electronic dance music group Major Lazer. Featuring French DJ and record producer DJ Snake with vocals from Danish singer M\u00d8, it was released on March 2, 2015 as the lead single from Major Lazer's third studio album, Peace Is the Mission (2015). It was written by Karen Marie \u00d8rsted (M\u00d8), Thomas Pentz, William Grigahcine and Phillip Meckseper, and produced by Major Lazer and DJ Snake. It is an EDM, electronic and moombahton song. \"Lean On\" was a critical and commercial success, peaking at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the UK Singles Chart. It reached number one in several other countries including Argentina, Australia, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Mexico and Switzerland; as well as the top 10 in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, France, Israel, Italy, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden. In November 2015, \"Lean On\" was named by Spotify as the most streamed song of all time, and has over 1 billion streams globally as of June 2017; however, it was later overtaken by Drake's \"One Dance\" (2016). The accompanying music video for \"Lean On\" was filmed in ND Studios, Karjat, Kaul Heritage City, in Vasai in Maharashtra, India and in the Golden Hall in Stockholm City Hall. The video premiered on March 23, 2015 and has over 2.8 billion views on YouTube as of May 2020. According to IFPI, \"Lean On\" was the fifth best selling song of 2015 worldwide, and one of the best-selling singles of all time, with global sales of 13.1 million. ==Background== Regarding the creative process behind \"Lean On\", producer Diplo of Major Lazer said, \"We wrote this song with M\u00d8 very early from an instrumental Jr Blender created in some sessions in Trinidad. It was a strong hook. Very big to me but the production was lacking an attitude we needed. A year later I remixed the song at a completely different tempo and asked DJ Snake for a signature post chorus. After he did his thing, me, M\u00d8 and Blender rewrote the song at the new tempo in Las Vegas and made something very unique that became our album's lead-off single. We're super proud of this song.\" Diplo offered a slower reggae arrangement of the song to Rihanna, who rejected it. He also offered said arrangement of the song to Nicki Minaj, who turned it down as well. Diplo called this turn of events \"a blessing in disguise. M\u00d8 sounds better than anybody was going to sound on that record.\" ==Critical reception== The song has received critical acclaim. Brennan Carley of Spin wrote, \"It's as if No Doubt met the C+C Music Factory\". Consequence of Sounds Michelle Geslani called the song a 'bouncy banger' and complimented M\u00d8's \"siren-like\" vocals. David Jeffries from AllMusic praised M\u00d8 and DJ Snake for helping the track \"deliver the sentimental lyrics and sensual house music at an intoxicating half-speed tempo.\" Billboard's Matt Medved called the song and the recent Diplo's collaboration with Skrillex on Jack \u00dc's \"Where Are \u00dc Now\" \"both innovates and finds crossover appeal\", with the first being called \"a pop gloss.\" Rolling Stone ranked \"Lean On\" at number 48 on its year-end list to find the 50 best songs of 2015, while Billboard listed it number one on its Top 10 Dance/Electronic songs of 2015. The latter magazine also ranked \"Lean On\" at number 3 on its year-end critics' poll for 2015: \"The Grammys got it wrong. It's rare that a dance record of this quality reaches this level of ubiquity\u2014after all, this is Spotifys most streamed song of all-time as of Nov. 2015. Despite being independently released, the infectious three-minute single became the poster child for dance crossover, dominating both radio and festival play and hitting No. 4 on the Hot 100. By Billboard's measure, \"Lean On\" was the dance/electronic song of the year.\" The prestigious Village Voice ranked \"Lean On\" at number 25 on their annual year-end critic's poll. On January 26, 2016, \"Lean On\" reached #3 on Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2015. ==Commercial performance== \"Lean On\" was a global commercial success.

This entry makes it Major Lazer and M\u00d8s highest-charting hit in the country at the time making Major Lazer's first top 10 and top 40, also making M\u00d8's first top 10 and second top 40 (\"Cold Water\", a collaboration with Justin Bieber, reached number two in 2016); \"Lean On\" also ties with DJ Snakes \"Turn Down for What\", which also reached number four in June 2014.
