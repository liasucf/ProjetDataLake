    "text": "The Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) is the highest honor bestowed by the United States government on outstanding scientists and engineers in the early stages of their independent research careers. The White House, following recommendations from participating agencies, confers the awards annually. To be eligible for a Presidential Award, an individual must be a US citizen, national or permanent resident. Some of the winning scientists and engineers receive up to a five-year research grant. == History == In February 1996, the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), was commissioned by President Bill Clinton to create an award program that would honor and support the achievements of young professionals at the outset of their independent research careers in the fields of science and technology. The stated aim of the award is to help maintain the leadership position of the United States in science. Originally, 60 recipients received the PECASE award per year. Due to increased participation by the Department of Defense, this has increased to 100 per year. The 2002 PECASE awards were not announced until May 2004 due to bureaucratic delays within the Bush administration. The 2013 PECASE awards were announced in February 2016 after a 2-year delay. The Trump administration announced the 2015, 2016, and 2017 awardees in 2019 with the awards being presented by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. == Agencies == The agencies participating in the PECASE Awards program are: * Department of Agriculture * Department of Commerce * Department of Defense * Department of Energy * Department of Education * Department of Health and Human Services: National Institutes of Health * Department of the Interior: United States Geological Survey * Department of Transportation * Department of Veterans Affairs * Environmental Protection Agency * National Aeronautics and Space Administration * National Science Foundation * Smithsonian Institution * United States Intelligence Community == Recipients == === 2015-2017 === On July 2,
