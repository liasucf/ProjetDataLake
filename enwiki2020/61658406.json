    "text": "The Westerplatte Monument, also known as the Monument of the Coast Defenders (Polish: Pomnik Obro\u0144c\u00f3w Wybrze\u017ca) is a war memorial located in Gda\u0144sk, Poland, on the Westereplatte Peninsula in the Gda\u0144sk harbour channel constructed between 1964\u20131966 to commemorate the Polish defenders of the Military Transit Depot (Wojskowa Sk\u0142adnica Tranzytowa, or WST) in the Battle of Westerplatte, one of the first battles in Germany's invasion of Poland, which marked the outbreak of World War II in Europe. ==History== The urban project including an unrealized museum was drafted by Adam Haupt, while the monument itself was designed by sculptors Franciszek Dusze\u0144ko and Henryk Kitowski. The project by Dusze\u0144ko and Kitowski was selected from 63 proposed projects. The construction of the monument was initiated by the Council for the Protection of Struggle and Martyrdom Sites (Rada Ochrony Pami\u0119ci Walk i M\u0119cze\u0144stwa) and consists of 236 granite blocks transported from the quarries in Strzegom and Bor\u00f3w and weighing 1,150 tons. The monument is decorated with bas-reliefs and inscriptions, which pay tribute to the defence of the Polish sea coast, the naval battles of WWII in which Polish sailors and soldiers took part as well as the Battle of Lenino, Battle of Studzianki and Battle of Ko\u0142obrzeg. The memorial also includes the inscription \"Glory to the Liberators\" (Chwa\u0142a wyzwolicielom). The shape of the monument resembles in its appearance a jagged bayonet impaled in the ground. Seven candle lights at the foot of the monument symbolically represent the seven days of heroic defence of Westerplatte by Polish soldiers against the numerically superior Nazi German army. The 22-meter high artificial mound on which the monument is located was erected from the earth collected from the redevelopment of the Port of Gda\u0144sk. The construction of the monument took 2 years to complete and it was ceremonially unveiled on 9 October 1966 on the anniversary of the Battle of Lenino. Each year, official state ceremonies to commemorate the outbreak of the Second World War take place at the foot of the monument and have been attended by prominent Polish and foreign dignitaries and heads of states. ==Gallery== File:Westerplatte 2846.JPG|Westerplatte Monument File:79th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II (3).jpg|79th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II in Gda\u0144sk File:Pomnik Obro\u0144c\u00f3w Wybrze\u017ca na p\u00f3\u0142wyspie Westerplatte 1.jpg|Westerplatte Monument seen from the distance File:Pomnik Obro\u0144c\u00f3w Wybrze\u017ca na Westerplatte.jpg|Inscriptions on the monument ==See also== *Museum of the Second World War *September Campaign *Battle of Wizna ==References== Category:1966 sculptures Category:Outdoor sculptures in Poland Category:World War II monuments and memorials in Poland Category:Buildings and structures in Gda\u0144sk Category:Sculptures in Poland ",
