This touristy, winemaking village is situated on the Route des Grands Crus in the C\u00f4te de Nuits. The village is noted for the Grand cru Burgundy wine that is produced from its vineyards, the most famous of which is Chambertin. ==Geography== Gevrey-Chambertin is one of the wine villages of the C\u00f4te de Nuits which lies along the foot of the C\u00f4te-d'Or escarpment, to the south of Dijon and with the broad Sa\u00f4ne valley plain to its east. It produces red Burgundy wine from vineyards at the village, Premier Cru and Grand Cru level. The vineyards on the slope of the C\u00f4te d'Or form a strip below and east of the woodland on the Jurassic limestone hills. In the plain of the Sa\u00f4ne to the east, there are large fields. The commune is also traversed by the A31 road and the railway from Dijon to the south with a large marshalling yard (Gevrey- Triage). There is also a stretch of Roman road from Dijon to the southern end of the Forest of C\u00eeteaux, to the south of the abbey. ==Population== ==History== === Origins=== As in England, \u00cele de France and in the South of France, vines in Burgundy were planted very early on. Only in Gevrey- Chambertin, however, have archaeological digs been able to find Gallo-Roman vines dating back to the 1st Century BC. The outline of 120 vine stocks was discovered in 2008, during the expansion of a residential development that was updating 300 septic tanks all lined up in an area of 6 km2. This archaeological discovery corroborates with texts written by Pliny the Elder and Columella, making it credible that the Gallo-Roman vines in Gevrey- Chambertin were the first vines to be planted in Bourgogne. The vines were planted in rows, just as they would be today, but the choice of land used and its exposure were quite different: the Gallo-Roman vines were planted on plains, as opposed to the terraces that most of today's C\u00f4tes de Nuits is grown on. Furthermore, wines made from these vines would have had a different taste, notably because the Gallo-Romans added spices as preservatives. ==Administration== {| align=\"center\" rules=\"all\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border: 1px solid #999; border-right: 2px solid #999; border-bottom: 2px solid #999; background: #f3fff3\" |+ style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em\"| List of mayors |-style=\"background: #ddffdd\" !
