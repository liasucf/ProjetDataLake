    "text": "Rachel M. Ewald is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Foster Care Support Foundation, Inc. The Foster Care Support Foundation FCSF is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that provides clothing, infant care equipment, and toys to an average of 4500 foster and displaced children throughout the state of Georgia annually. The services are free for those raised on basic state per-diem and for grandparents and relatives raising their grandchildren, nieces or nephews without the biological parent/s present in the home or in their children's lives. In 1996, Ms. Ewald began collecting and distributing clothing and toy donations from neighbors to give to local foster children in need. The program and need grew quickly and the Foundation was incorporated in 2000 and has provided for over 66,000 children since its incorporation. Ewald, a foster parent herself for fourteen years to over 50 children and mother of five, understood the difficulty for some to raise a child on the small per diem the state offered at that time. The center allows for more foster parents to afford to care for state children, while also allowing the children to acquire their own clothes, toys, and school supplies to be like any other child. This could be difficult after losing everything when pulled from their biological homes. The organization's donation/distribution center, located at 115 Mansell Place in Roswell GA is set up like a retail store and is fully stocked with clothing, toys, bikes, highchairs, school supplies and other necessities, where foster and relative care parents or grands raising grands throughout the state can access either by appointment or mail out for free. Rachel Ewald has also written a set of transition guidelines \"Healthy Children, Healthy Adults\" for foster care and adoption, with the intent of reducing disruption and trauma in foster and adoptive homes and when moving children to reunify them with their biological families or to an adoptive home. FCSF provides much needed support with clothing, toys, school supplies and infant items to Grandparents who are the sole caretakers of their grandchildren, the faster growing population of foster care in the country. The Foundation provides an event called 'Prom-A-Palooza' in February where teen girls in foster, relative, grandparent and group homes from all over the State of Georgia attend to select prom a dress, jewelry, shoes, accessories and make up with consultation and a photo opt so that they can be a part of their own high school proms with their friends without worry of the cost. This is a wonderful event that is always rewarding for all involved. Funded by private individual donations, corporate sponsors, foundation grants, and faith based organizations, FCSF receives no government or federal money for the program. FCSF is a private/public partnership with the State Division of Family and Children's Services. Funds and sponsors are always needed to operate the foundation as the Ms Ewald continues to reach out to thousands of children across the State needing FCSF's services every year. The Hope 4 Tomorrow mentoring program launched in 2016 carefully matches teens with professional and caring adults to help mentor and guide them through their middle and high school years as they prepare to age out into adult life. == Recognition == Rachel Ewald has been recognized by many groups and organizations throughout the United States for her efforts in changing the face of foster care in Georgia.
