    "text": "The PIE extension after Nanyang Flyover, looking towards Tuas. The Pan Island Expressway (Abbreviation: PIE) is the oldest and longest of Singapore's expressways. Currently, it is also Singapore's longest road.The Book of Singapore Record It extends along the length of the island, connecting Tuas in the west to Singapore Changi Airport in the east. Its length is . ==Construction== Construction of the PIE started in 1964 and took place in four phases. The first phase involved widening the stretch of Whitley Road from Mount Pleasant Flyover to Thomson Flyover, Jalan Toa Payoh, Jalan Kolam Ayer, and Paya Lebar Way, and replacing all the traffic light junctions on these roads with grade-separated interchanges. Those stretches were completed in 1969. Similarly, a second phase was constructed in 1969 and was completed in 1975 from Whitley Road (Mount Pleasant Flyover) all the way to Jalan Anak Bukit. Subsequently (third phase), the section from Jalan Eunos to East Coast Parkway, which involved the construction of a new road, started construction in 1976 and thus led to the proposed interchanges, Bedok North Road Interchange, Upper Changi Road East Interchange and the connecting T-interchange at East Coast Parkway. This was completed in 1980. The western end started construction in 1977 to parallel via Jurong Road. The fourth phase, the western end from Jalan Anak Bukit to Corporation Road was completed in 1981. The expressway was long when completed. On 1 September 1982, the interchange at Simei Avenue/PIE was completed, together with the opening of Simei Avenue from Tampines Avenue 5 to Upper Changi Road. ==Expansion== The Pan Island Expressway (PIE) is being extended and realigned from Jurong Camp to Pioneer Road North. The extension and realignment are part of an 8-km extension from Hong Kah Circle to Upper Jurong Road at Safti, since 2 October 1991. The Public Works Department is also undertaking an extension from Hong Kah Flyover to Tuas. Modification and extension of the western end of the expressway started on 1 October 1991 to connect it to the Kranji Expressway which was being built at that time. A new section was built. It forked from the existing PIE at Hong Kah Flyover, intersecting the Kranji Expressway at Tengah Flyover and ending at the Tuas Flyover with the Ayer Rajah Expressway. It replaces some roads - Hong Kah Circle, Lorong Kabong, Bulim Cemetery, Gek Poh Road and Joo Tiong Road. The section of the old PIE from Hong Kah Flyover to Corporation Road was downgraded to an arterial road and renamed Jurong West Avenue 2. On 3 December 1993, the PIE extension was opened from Jurong Road all the way to Upper Jurong Road, and converting parts of Upper Jurong Road into Pan Island Expressway. As the amount of traffic using the KJE and PIE to Jurong Industrial Estate increased, the Land Transport Authority upgraded the stretch of the PIE between Tengah Flyover and Tuas Road to a four-lane dual carriageway from a three-lane dual carriageway. The work started in March 2004 and ended in March 2006. Beginning in July 2011, the stretch of the PIE between Clementi Avenue 6 and Adam Road was widened. The widening work involved adding one lane to both sides of the expressway as well as the structural expansion of the existing Eng Neo, Chantek and Anak Bukit Flyovers. The widened portions were progressively opened to traffic from July 2013. ==List of exits== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; color: black; border-collapse:
