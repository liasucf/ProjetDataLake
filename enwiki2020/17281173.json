    "text": "Williamson Road is a Roanoke, Virginia neighborhood located in north, central Roanoke. It borders the neighborhoods of Roundhill and Preston Park on the north, Belmont on the south, Hollins on the east, and Gainsboro and Washington Park on the west opposite Interstate 581. The neighborhood is bisected by the road of the same name Williamson Road. ==History== The area that encompasses the Williamson Road was annexed from Roanoke County in two separate annexations, with the areas south of present-day U.S. 460 (Orange Avenue) annexed in 1882 and those north annexed in 1949. Much of the residential development within the neighborhood reflects that of typical suburban development following World War Two. Today the neighborhood is the location of the Roanoke Civic Center and Bowman Park. ==References== ==External links== * Williamson Road Area Plan which includes the Williamson Road neighborhood Category:Neighborhoods in Roanoke, Virginia ",
