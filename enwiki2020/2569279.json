This is one of two German speaking municipalities located in the majority French-speaking Bernese Jura (Jura Bernois). The other is Seehof. ==History== Schelten is first mentioned in 1563 as la Schilt. In 1914 it was mentioned as Schelten. For most of its history it was owned by the provost of Moutier-Grandval under the Prince-Bishop of Basel. When many of the nearby cities and towns converted to the new faith of the Protestant Reformation, Schelten remained Catholic along with the sous les Roches region. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Schelten became part of the French D\u00e9partement of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the D\u00e9partement of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Schelten was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. The village is part of the parish of Mervelier. In 1861 the Chapel of St. Anthony was built in the village. The chapel was restored in 1985\u201387. Traditionally the village was French speaking, but after it became a part of the Canton of Bern in 1815 the number of German speakers increased. In 1914 its name changed from La Scheulte to Schelten to reflect the growing German speaking population. The village became a stronghold of German culture and generally opposed Jurassic separatism.
