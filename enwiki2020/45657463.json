    "text": "Rinaldo Paluzzi (May 27, 1927 \u2013 March 27, 2013) was an American-Spanish Abstract Art and Geometric abstraction painter and sculptor in the post-World War II era. He was born in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, and died in Madrid, Spain. Paluzzi\u2019s works are in a number of permanent collections, from the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden at the Smithsonian to the Union Fenosa Museum of Contemporary Art in Coruna, Spain.http://www.javierbmartin.com/index.php/pintores-javier-b- martin/222-rinaldo-paluzzi ==Education and works== After serving in the U.S. Navy during WWII, he was a student at the John Herron School of Art (now part of the Indiana University) from 1948 to 1950. He then left to attend the Accademia di Belle Arti in Rome Italy until the end of 1951. After returning to the Herron, he received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1953. He remained at the Herron, where in 1957 he was awarded a Master of Fine Arts. The following is from the Herron Chronicle (published in 2003). ::Twenty-seven students received their diplomas and degrees at commencement on June 9, 1957. One of the graduates in attendance was Rinalo (Randy) Paluzzi who received his MFA that day and a top $2,000 Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation grant. He was just as surprised as anyone that such honors were coming to him, considering that a mere eight years before he had been at home in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, discharged from the Navy, with no high school diploma, no clear prospects, and no interest in art at all. His elder brother Guarino had just transferred to Herron, and he suggested that Randy use his G.I. Bill and follow him there. Paluzzi recalled that his first drawings in Harry Davis' class were \"terrible.\" Since the Tiffany grant could be used without restrictions, Paluzzi decided to spend it in Italy, parceling it out to last a full year. Aiming to take his wife, former classmate Claudine Kelsey, and his three infant daughters along, and realizing the grant would not stretch that far, he spent the summer of 1957 working 12-hour shifts driving a mail truck to raise another $1,000. The Paluzzis left for Rome on October 2.Pages 127-130 of The Herron Chronicle by Harriet Warkel, Martin Krause, and S.L. Berry with an index by Jennifer L.
