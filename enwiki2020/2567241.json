The Rimpau Loop in Mid-City was an important terminus of the Los Angeles Railway (\"Yellow Cars\") streetcars. The Pico Blvd. city streetcar line \"P\" turned around here in the Rimpau Loop.\"LARY: Rimpau Look / PE: Vineyard Junction, 1938\", PERYHS site From here, Santa Monica city buses ran to Downtown Santa Monica, and to this day, Pico and Rimpau is the terminus for several Santa Monica Transit lines. Vineyard Junction in Mid-City was where Pacific Electric \"Red Car\" lines converged. The lines ran from Downtown Los Angeles south to Venice Boulevard, then West along Venice to Vineyard Junction. From here they went along Venice Blvd. to Venice and Redondo Beach; while others went along San Vicente Blvd. northwest toward what is now West Hollywood as well as via Beverly Hills to Santa Monica. It was the site of an accident on July 13, 1913, in which two wooden streetcars crashed into each other, with 14 people dead and 200 people injured. As a result, the Pacific Electric ordered its future cars to be made of steel, and it was recommended that signaling be introduced on the PE's lines. ===Today=== As part of their long-range plans, the Los Angeles County MTA has proposed the Metro Crenshaw/LAX Line, which would place a rail transit station in Mid-City. The proposed rail stop is at the intersection of Pico and San Vicente Boulevards\u2014site of the old Vineyard Junction. The old Vineyard Junction site is now occupied by the end terminal for the Santa Monica Big Blue Bus. The Crenshaw Light Rail Line would allow Mid-City residents to easy access to the city's east/west rail lines: the D Line along Wilshire Boulevard, the E Line from Downtown Los Angeles to Downtown Santa Monica, and the C Line from Norwalk to Redondo Beach and soon near LAX. Currently, the Mid-City alignment is unfunded, and part of the Crenshaw Corridor's \"Northern Feasibility Study\".
