The airport's development started in 1936 and the gravel runway completed in 1938. That same year, Kamloops acquired another , as well as land for airport use. The Department of Transport, now known as Transport Canada, granted money for airport development in 1939, with the airfield's runway finishing in that year. On April 13, 1939, an Aeronca aircraft made the first official landing on the runway. The airport was publicly opened on August 5, 1939, along with an air show presented at the structure itself with over 30 aircraft. \u2013 via Google News Archive Later that month, it was classified as a port of entry by the Canadian government. During World War II, additional activity occurred at the airport. In April 1942, Vancouver-based Gilbert Flight School transferred its service to Kamloops, as civil flights provided in British Columbia's Lower Mainland were canceled. In addition, the airport was used by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) as an alternate route for the no longer existent Air Transport Command (ATC) for flights to the Soviet Union. During the war Kamloops gained access to for further airport expansion, as well as the addition of taxi and apron services. However, after World War II, part of the airport's land were sold to Canada's Department of Agriculture, with the size reducing to . In May 1944, the Governor General of Canada at that time, Earl of Athlone, entitled the structure Fulton Field, in honor of John Fulton, a Wing Commander server born in Kamloops. This was confirmed by George H. Greer, the secretary of the Kamloops Board of Trade at the time. Throughout its history, a number of airlines have served it. Canadian Pacific Air Lines provided daily flights in 1950 connecting to the communities of Quesnel, Prince George, Williams Lake and Vancouver. By 1951, the airport founded and became headquarters of Central British Columbia Airways, which was later known as Pacific Western Airlines, but is no longer existent. However, the following year, its headquarters was transferred to Richmond's Vancouver International Airport. The federal Department of Transport regained rights to the airport in 1961, beginning an expansion program. The airfield saw its runways expand in 1963 and 1964. In 1966, Canadian Pacific Air Lines was serving the airport with a Vancouver - Kamloops - Prince George - Fort. St. John - Grande Prairie - Edmonton round trip flight operated with a Douglas DC-6B propliner six days a week and also a Kamloops - Williams Lake - Quesnel - Prince George round trip flown with a Douglas DC-3 six days a week as well with both of these services not operating on Sundays.http://www.timetableimages.com, April 24, 1966 Canadian Pacific Airlines system timetable The first air traffic controllers started working at Kamloops Airport in 1967. That year the airport served approximately 29,200 passengers. There had previously been proposals for relocating the airport due to low public visibility during the fall and winter seasons of a specific year. The move was never carried out because another location could not be found. Instead the airport was expanded by 1969. This saw its administrative buildings, offices, baggage area and coffee shop being improved, costing $85,000. Also by 1969, jet service had arrived at Kamloops as Pacific Western Airlines had begun nonstop Boeing 737-200 jetliner flights to Vancouver and Calgary with additional nonstop service to Vancouver being operated by the air carrier with Convair 640 turboprop aircraft which the airline called the \"Javelin Jet-Prop\".http://www.timetableimages.com, Sept. 28, 1969 Pacific Western Airlines system timetable= There was a flood threat close to the airport in 1972, while in the following year, the airfield's runways were extended.

Its catchment area has a population of approximately 138,000 residents. Kelowna International Airport, an international airport operated in nearby city of Kelowna, has had a small impact on this airport, since they both share the same catchment area. About 13 percent of the local residents in 2007 choose the Kelowna International Airport over the Kamloops Airport to fly to regional destinations, specifically due to its significant growth. Despite this, some Kelowna residents choose the Kamloops Airport over their local airport. On 17 May, 2020, a Canadair CT-114 Tutor plane from the Snowbirds, Canada's military flight demonstration squadron, crashed in Kamloops shortly after takeoff, injuring the pilot and killing a passenger. The largest aircraft to visit Kamloops was an RCAF Airbus CC-150 Polaris bringing in the investigators for the aforementioned crash. ==419 (City of Kamloops) Squadron== John Fulton is an alumnus of the class of 1929 at Kamloops Secondary High School. While growing up in Kamloops, John became enamored of flying. For a short while he tried banking, but he had a longing for something more. After only a year he abandoned banking and went down to the Boeing School of Aeronautics in Oakland, California. He was attracted to the military way of life and in 1934 travelled to England to join the Royal Air Force. In 1935 he received his commission as a Pilot Officer with a bomber transport squadron. He was deployed to Egypt and stayed there for just over two years. With the start of hostilities of World War 2, he came back to England and flew with a bomber squadron. As the pace of operations intensified John flew over twenty missions in three months. In September 1940 he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross then in January 1942 he received the Air Force Cross and in August of the same year he also received the Distinguished Service Order. When the RCAF decided to organize its own 419 Squadron, the first senior officers were Canadians on loan from the RAF. John Fulton was the first Commanding Officer. He enjoyed great popularity among the officers and men of the squadron. Indeed, his Squadron often referred to themselves as \"Moosemen\" after the John\u2019s nickname. On the night of August 2, 1942, the Squadron went to Hamburg. On the way home, John\u2019s aircraft was set upon by enemy fighters. A single message was transmitted by the aircraft - \"Wounded \u2026 fighters \u2026 five hundred feet.\" The aircraft was lost over the sea. The high esteem in which the men of No.419 Squadron held their missing leader was demonstrated by the adoption of his nickname as their own thus immortalizing the first commanding officer of \"Moose\" Squadron for all time. No. 419 was the only Canadian squadron to be named after a person. Today 419 Tactical Fighter (Training) Squadron conducts the NATO Flying Training Canada program for Canada, Denmark, Italy, Singapore and the Royal Air Force at 4 Wing in Cold Lake, Alberta. This program prepares future fighter pilots for training on CF-18 class aircraft. Members of the Squadron continue to refer to themselves as \"Moosemen.\" On May 29, 1964, the Kamloops Airport was \"Dedicated in Honour of Wing Commander John Fulton, D.S.O., D.F.C., A.F.C., and the men of the air service from Kamloops and District\" by His Excellency Major General Earl of Athlone K.G.
