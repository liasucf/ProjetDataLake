    "text": "The University of Southern Queensland (USQ) is a medium-sized, regional university based in Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia, with three university campuses at Toowoomba, Springfield and Ipswich. It offers courses in law, health, engineering, the sciences, business, education, and the arts. The institution was established in 1969 as the Darling Downs campus of the Queensland Institute of Technology. In 1970, the institution had provided studying programs for rural Queensland and international communities. In 1971, it became the Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education, then the University College of Southern Queensland in 1990 and finally the University of Southern Queensland in 1992. It operates three research institutes and seven research centres which focus on a wide range of business, agricultural, scientific, environmental, and technological issues. The University is recognised for having the largest Japanese-designed garden in Australia, Australia's largest solar integrated carpark, and a library with rainforest and water features. In 2017, the University won the international Green Gown award for its approach to sustainability focusing on renewable energy, waste reduction, water retention, and integration of sustainability into strategic planning. In 2012, the University's archaeologists discovered the oldest Australian rock art of 28,000 years old in the Northern Territory, and in 2018, the University's astronomers discovered a new planet that orbits an ancient star almost 2 billion years older than the sun. The University is recognised for its efforts in preventing violence against women and cited as employer of choice for gender equality by the Federal Government's Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA). ==History== === Dellys Kelly === At the age of 26, Dellys Kelly was working as a manager at East Greenmount. In 1958, with a bought map, she drove to Canberra to start her campaign for a new university in Toowoomba. After driving to the Parliament House and asking to meet with Prime Minister Robert Menzies, she was challenged by him to raise \u00a330,000 before he would discuss the issue. She received strong support from the community, and after eleven weeks, the money was raised. In 1960, the Darling Downs University Establishment Association was founded. === Overview === Queensland Institute of Technology (Darling Downs) opened on 2 February 1967 in Toowoomba. It had 140 foundation students. In 1971, the institute became the Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education (DDIAE). Managed by its own College Council, DDIAE educated 75% of the country's international students in the 1986-1987 school year. From 1980 to 1990, DDIAE grew significantly from 1,000 to 8,000 full-time student equivalents (EFTSL). It became the University College of Southern Queensland (UCSQ) in 1990, under the sponsorship of the University of Queensland. In 1992, the institution became the University of Southern Queensland (USQ) when it gained full university status. USQ was a founding member of the Regional Universities Network that was launched in 2011. The Network's research in 2013 showed that USQ generated $411.7 million into the economy of Queensland every year as well as household income of $255.4 million and 3,313 jobs in the communities of Toowoomba, Fraser Coast, and Springfield. Along with Toowoomba's investments in data centers, landscaped and business parks, air and land infrastructures, USQ has been contributing an important part in making the region a centre of agribusiness, sustainable development, and trade. === Milestones === * 2004, 8 July: Groundbreaking was held at Springfield campus. * 2006, 11 August: Springfield campus was officially opened by Minister for Education and Science Julie Bishop. * 2007, Semester 1: The first students started their studies at Springfield campus. * 2014, 5 March: Health & Recreation Club worth of $1.2 million and Engineering Laboratory were opened at Springfield campus. * 2015, 7 January: Ipswich campus was formally transferred to USQ. * 2015, 10 August: Clinical simulation labs worth of $1.7 million were opened at Ipswich campus. * 2015, 26 August: Building B (Awarded 6 Star Green Star by Green Building Council of Australia) worth of $45 million was opened at Springfield campus. * 2016, Semester 1: Bachelor of Aviation was launched at Springfield campus and Bachelor of Midwifery was launched at Ipswich campus. * 2016, 20 June: Psychology and Counselling Clinic was opened at Ipswich campus. * 2017, 1 March: Midwifery Simulation Centre and Paramedic Simulation House were opened at Ipswich campus. * 2017, 27 October: Boeing 737 flight simulator worth of $1 million went into operation at Springfield campus. * 2017, Semester 2: The first students of Bachelor of Paramedicine were farewelled at Ipswich campus. ==Campuses== Toowoomba campus USQ ensures that, as a regional university, its curriculum serves local and regional employment needs, it engages in regional social and economic development, and serves the regional community.

Based on competitive grants won and industry funded research collaborations, USQ has significant and core research strength in the broad area of agriculture and the environment. This core research strength generated over $10 million in new grant and industry funding, announced by vice- chancellor Bill Lovegrove in 2008.Jim Campbell 16 December 2008, The Morning Bulletin, In 2003, the university established the Institute for Agriculture and the Environment (IAgE) with improved biotechnology and pathology laboratories. In 2017, the Queensland Drought Mitigation Centre (QDMC) was established as a result of collaboration between the university and the government. In 2017, as a part of the mega $15m campus expansion, the university started upgrading the Agricultural Science and Engineering Precinct (ASEP) to facilitate agricultural and material engineering development, including constructing new microbiology laboratories, glasshouses, dehumidified storage, and controlled ecological environments, developing methods of soil pathogen resistance, and applying vision sensing and robotics trials. In 2017, the university hosted Australia's first regional meeting with Australia-ASEAN Council (AAC) in Toowoomba Campus to discuss the issue of trade and agriculture in preparation for the Sydney ASEAN-Australia Special Summit in 2018. The participants addressed the global demand for food, the current problems in the industry, and the development of new technologies in environmental science, engineering, and agribusiness. In 2018, a new climate project of $8 million was established by the University, the Queensland government, and the MLA, bringing together world scientists to find better solutions for managing drought and predicting seasonal climates. USQ researchers undertake different roles with international climate organisations, such as the President of the United Nations\u2019 World Meteorological Organization (with the commission to design better services for global agribusiness and climate risk management) and ocean expeditor in the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (with the mission to examine how ocean currents affect the world's weather).
