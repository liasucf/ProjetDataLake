    "text": "Salty Dog was an American rock band from Los Angeles formed in 1986 by guitarist Scott Lane, bassist Michael Hannon, and drummer Khurt Maier. Later, they were joined by lead singer Jimmi Bleacher. The band was managed by Vicky Hamilton, who also managed Poison, Faster Pussycat, and Guns N' Roses. ==History== Before the recording of their debut album, guitarist Scott Lane was replaced by Pete Reeven in 1987. The band signed a record deal with Geffen, and recorded their debut album Every Dog Has Its Day. The record was recorded in Wales, and the band was reportedly not told by the label they had to pay back the recording costs. Salty Dog appeared on a flexi-disc along with the thrash metal band Nuclear Assault which appeared in issue 280 of Kerrang! magazine, where they covered the Sonny Boy Williamson song Sad To Be Alone. Released in 1990, Every Dog Has Its Day peaked at #176 on the Billboard charts. In 1991, Jimmi Bleacher was replaced by Darrel Beach, and by 1993 the band had ceased activity. Members of Salty Dog would go on to join bands such as Dangerous Toys, American Dog, Bogus Toms, Mudpie, and Tweed. On December 10, 2011, Salty Dog reunited to perform a one off reunion show at The Key Club in Hollywood, California. On March 23, 2018, the French record label Escape Music released Lost Treasure, a collection of previously unreleased demos recorded with Darrel Beach. == Members == === Every Dog Has His Day and reunion lineup === * Jimmi Bleacher- Vocals, guitar, keyboard, piano, harmonica * Pete Reeven- Guitar, banjo, backing vocals * Michael \"Hilljack\" Hannon- Bass, backing vocals * Khurt Maier- Drums, percussion === Other members === * Scott Lane- Guitar * Darrel Beach- Vocals == Discography== * Every Dog Has Its Day (1990, Geffen) * Lost Treasure (2018, Escape) ==References== Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles ",
