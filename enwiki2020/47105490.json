    "text": "The Hermagoras Society ( or ) is Slovenia's oldest publishing house and has branches in Klagenfurt (Austria), Celje (Slovenia), and Gorizia (Italy). Named after Catholic Saint Hermagoras of Aquileia it originated on July 27, 1851 at the behest of Bishop Anton Martin Slom\u0161ek for the purpose of instructing Slovenes in reading and writing. By 1918 the society had over 90,000 members and had published more than 16.3 million books. In 1940 during World War II both the Klagenfurt and Celje locations were closed down by the Nazis, who confiscated the printing presses and destroyed books. After World War II ended, the printing presses were returned, and the Hermagoras Society resumed operation. Since then the Gorizia branch of the Hermagoras Society has published the monthly magazine Dru\u017eina in Dom (Family and Home) and the encyclopedia Primorski Biografski Leksikon (Encyclopedia of Littoral Biography). The branch cooperates with the Klagenfurt location in publishing an annual almanac (Slov. Koledar). The Celje location, meanwhile, was nationalized after World War II and forced to publish exclusively socialist materials until 1970, when it was reorganized. While its membership has fluctuated from 60,000 members in 1970 to 25,000 in 1990, as of 1991 it remained one of the three largest publishers in Slovenia. In 2001 the Hermagoras Society celebrated its 150th anniversary, and the first president of Slovenia, Milan Ku\u010dan, gave a speech commemorating the society's publication of 40 million books in Slovene since its founding. ==References== ==External links== * The A to Z of Slovenia by Leopoldina Plut-Pregelj and Carole Rogel, pg. 434 Category:Book publishing companies Category:Publishing companies of Slovenia Category:Publishing companies established in 1851 Category:Cultural history of Slovenia Category:1851 establishments in the Austrian Empire ",
