    "text": "Highway 104 in Nova Scotia, Canada, runs from Fort Lawrence at the New Brunswick border near Amherst to River Tillard near St. Peter's. Except for the portion on Cape Breton Island between Port Hawkesbury and St. Peter's, it is part of the Trans-Canada Highway. Highway 104 mostly supplants the former route of Trunk 4. In 1970, all sections of Trunk 4 west of New Glasgow were renumbered, although the number was added back in the Mount Thom and Wentworth Valley areas in the 1990s when new alignments of Highway 104 opened to traffic. The provincial government named the highway the Miners Memorial Highway on 8 September 2008 one month before the 50th anniversary of the Springhill Mining Disaster of 23 October 1958. ==Route description== View of Cobequid Pass, toll section of Highway 104 through Colchester County. Highway 104 outside Westville, Nova Scotia (Exit 21). The highway's present alignment measures long, of which the western between the inter-provincial border with New Brunswick at Fort Lawrence through to Sutherlands River is a 4-lane divided freeway. The eastern from Sutherlands River to River Tillard is a mixture of 2-lane controlled access freeway known as a Super 2, uncontrolled access 2-lane highway, and 4-lane divided freeway sections. Highway 104 is divided into two distinct sections; the Trans-Canada Highway section which runs from the New Brunswick border to Port Hastings, and a smaller section on Cape Breton Island between Port Hawkesbury and St. Peter's. === Trans Canada Highway === From the inter-provincial border at Fort Lawrence, Highway 104 is a 4-lane divided freeway with posted speed limit of and runs east for past the towns of Amherst and Oxford to Thomson Station. This section had been built in the 1960s as a Super 2 and was upgraded to a 4-lane divided freeway that opened in 1993. From Thomson Station the highway runs southeast for to Masstown, this segment is a tolled section known as the Cobequid Pass, which opened on 15 November 1997. From Masstown, the highway runs east and northeast for to the rural community of Onslow, near Truro, and intersects Highway 102, the main 4-lane divided freeway connecting the Trans-Canada Highway with Halifax and southern Nova Scotia. Highway 104 continues for , past Westville, to Highway 106, a branch of the Trans-Canada Highway that connects to Prince Edward Island via ferry. The highway continues east for to Stellarton and New Glasgow, with the highway passing through Sellarton; however, New Glasglow is located just to the north of the highway. The highway continues to Sutherlands River, were it reaches the eastern extent of the end of the 4-lane divided freeway. East of Sutherlands River, Highway 104 becomes a Super 2 with a posted speed limit of . The highway runs east for to Barney's River Station, and was built between 1964 and 1965 as a Super 2 and remains as a controlled access highway with dedicated passing lanes. East of Barney's River Station, the highway runs southeast for to James River as an uncontrolled access highway which was formerly part of Trunk 4. Past James River, the highway runs east for to Addington Forks as a Super 2, controlled access highway, where the highway runs east for to South River Road along a new alignment of 4-lane divided freeway that opened on September 19, 2012. Prior to this new alignment opening, Highway 104 ran east on the present alignment of Trunk 4 and Post Road in the town of Antigonish and included three intersections controlled by traffic lights. The highway continues from South River Road as a 4-lane divided freeway, which opened October 22, 2016, for to Dagger Woods. Prior to this new alignment opening, this section was an uncontrolled access highway (formerly Trunk 4). From the end of the freeway section at Dagger Woods, the highway runs east for to Pomquet Forks as a Super 2 and remains as a controlled access highway, although there are several at-grade intersections. East of Pomquet Forks, the highway runs east for to Heatherton as an uncontrolled access highway (formerly Trunk 4) and speed limit reduces . Past Heatherton, the highway runs east for to Auld's Cove and speed limit increased back to . At Auld's Cove, the highway becomes an uncontrolled access highway with a posted speed limit of and begins a concurrency with Trunk 4. It crosses the Strait of Canso along the Canso Causeway to Port Hastings on Cape Breton Island. At Port Hastings, the highway intersects Trunk 4, Trunk 19 and Highway 105 at a roundabout where Highway 105 proceeds east carrying the Trans-Canada Highway designation. === Cape Breton Island === From the roundabout at Port Hastings, the is a gap in Highway 104 which is connected by Trunk 4, passing the town of Port Hawkesbury. The highway reappears at the Exit 43 interchange for Trunk 4 in Melville, just outside of Port Hawkesbury. A Highway 104 bypass from Port Hastings to Melville has been proposed in the past. Concept designs have shown a new alignment of 4-lane freeway being built around the northwest side of Port Hastings, crossing Highway 105 at a new interchange near an electrical substation. The new alignment of Highway 104 would proceed east and then southeast approximately following a power line corridor to the Exit 43 interchange in Melville. From Port Hawkesbury, the highway runs east as a controlled access Super 2 for to its current eastern terminus at an at-grade intersection with Trunk 4 in River Tillard, near St. Peters. An extension of Highway 104 from River Tillard to Sydney River has been proposed in the past. The Nova Scotia provincial government has designated the entire length of Highway 104 from Fort Lawrence to River Tillard as a \"strategic highway\" to qualify for federal cost-sharing of maintenance and future upgrades. This designation has also been applied to the remaining Trunk 4 corridor in Cape Breton along the south shore of Bras d'Or Lake from St. Peters to Sydney River. It is eventually envisioned that the Trans-Canada Highway will follow the entire length of Highway 104 from Amherst to Sydney River as a 4-lane freeway, upgraded from the existing two-lane freeway and uncontrolled access sections of the highway. == History == Highway 104 was upgraded in various stages as follows: * KM 0 to 49, section from the New Brunswick border to Thomson Station had been built in the 1960s as a Super 2 and was upgraded to a 4-lane divided freeway in 1993. *KM 49 to 92, section from Thomson Station to Masstown had been built as a 4-lane divided freeway that opened November 15, 1997; tolled section known as Cobequid Pass. *KM 92 to 146, section from Masstown to Salt Springs had been built in the 1960s as a Super 2 and was upgraded to a 4-lane divided freeway that opened in the early 1990s. * KM 146 to 159, section from Salt Springs to Westville Road was built as a new alignment of 4-lane divided freeway that opened in the late 1990s. Prior to this new alignment opening, Highway 104 ran east on the present alignment of Trunk 4. * KM 159 to 166, section from Westville Road to Plymouth had been built in the 1960s as a Super 2 and was upgraded to a 4-lane divided freeway that opened in the early 1990s. * KM 166 to 174, section from Plymouth to Pine Tree had been built in the 1960s as a Super 2 and was upgraded to a 4-lane divided freeway that opened in fall 2011. * KM 174 to 177, section from Pine Tree to Sutherlands River had been built in the 1960s as an uncontrolled access highway (formerly Trunk 4) and was upgraded to a 4-lane divided freeway that opened in fall 2012. *KM 177 to 219, section from Sutherlands River to Addington Forks had been built in the 1960s as a Super 2. *KM 219 to 228, section from Addington Forks to South River Road, built in the 2010s as a 4-lane divided freeway that opened September 19, 2012. *KM 228 to 235 section from South River Road to Dagger Woods, built in the 2010s as a 4-lane divided freeway that opened October 22, 2016. *KM 235 to 236, section from Dagger Woods to Pomquet Forks had been built in the 1960s as a Super 2. *KM 236 to 239, section from Pomquet Forks to Heatherton had been built in the 1950s; originally part of Trunk 4. *KM 239 to 269, section from Heatherton to Aulds Cove had been built from 1965-1969 as a Super 2. *KM 269 to 274, section from Auld's Cove to Port Hastings had been built and upgraded in the 1950s and 1960s, with the Canso Causeway opening in 1955. *KM 282 to 319, section from Port Hawkesbury to River Tillard has been built in the 1970s as a Super 2. == Future == The Province of Nova Scotia awarded the P3 contract that will twin a section of Highway 104 between Sutherlands River and Antigonish to Dexter Nova Alliance. As part the project, there will be of existing highway upgraded and a new, realigned section; the bypassed section of Highway 104 between Barney's River Station and Marshy Hope would revert to being part of Trunk 4. Construction is scheduled to begin the spring of 2020, with a completion date of no later than the end of 2023. ==Exit list== ==References== 104 Nova Scotia 104 Category:Limited-access roads in Canada 104 104 104 104 104 104 104 Category:Antigonish, Nova Scotia Category:Transport in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia ",
