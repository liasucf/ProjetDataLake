The nation's first flower show was held in Philadelphia in 1829, and showcased many exotic and native plants. The flower show moved to the now-demolished Philadelphia Civic Center in 1966, where it remained each year until 1996, when it moved to its present location at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. Today, PHSHistory of the Philadelphia Flower Show contributes to the local economy and the green life of Philadelphia and the region. Proceeds from the Flower Show support thousands of revitalization projects in communities. In recent years, a youth division was added to the pressed flower category, with the most recent winner being Kendall Wolson, a 17-year-old student from New Jersey who created a scene depicting two bears catching fish in a river. ==References== ==External links== *Philadelphia International Flower Show official site *Pennsylvania Horticultural Society Category:Culture of Philadelphia Category:Tourist attractions in Philadelphia Category:Flower shows Category:Annual events in Pennsylvania Category:March events Category:Recurring events established in 1829 Category:1829 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:Agricultural shows in the United States ",
