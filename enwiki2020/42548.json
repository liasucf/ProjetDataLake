    "text": "The Gulf of Guinea is the northeasternmost part of the tropical Atlantic Ocean from Cape Lopez in Gabon, north and west to Cape Palmas in Liberia. The intersection of the Equator and Prime Meridian (zero degrees latitude and longitude) is in the gulf. Among the many rivers that drain into the Gulf of Guinea are the Niger and the Volta. The coastline on the gulf includes the Bight of Benin and the Bight of Bonny. ==Name== The origin of the name Guinea is thought to be an area in the region, although the specifics are disputed. Bovill (1995) gives a thorough description: The name \"Guinea\" was also applied to south coast of West Africa, north of the Gulf of Guinea, which became known as \"Upper Guinea\", and the west coast of Southern Africa, to the east, which became known as \"Lower Guinea\". The name \"Guinea\" is still attached to the names of three countries in Africa: Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Equatorial Guinea, as well as New Guinea in Melanesia. ==Geography== The main river shedding its waters in the gulf is the Niger River. Different definitions of the geographic limits of the Gulf of Guinea are given; the International Hydrographic Organization defines the southwest extent of the Gulf of Guinea as \"A line from Cap Lopez (), in Gabon, northwestward to Ihl\u00e9u Gago Coutinho (Ilh\u00e9u das R\u00f4las) (); and thence a line from Ihl\u00e9u Gago Coutinho northwestward to Cape Palmas (), in Liberia.
