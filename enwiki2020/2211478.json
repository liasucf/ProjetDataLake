The motto literally translates to \"Excellence in action is Yoga\" essentially implying that doing your work well is (true) yoga or \"Diligence leads to Excellence\". It is sourced to Sri Krishna's discourse to Arjuna in Bhagavad Gita, chapter 2 verse 50. This quote in its larger context of Gita urges man to acquire equanimity because such a soul endowed with the mind of equanimity allows him to shed the effects of his good and evil deeds in this world itself. Equanimity is the source of perfection in Karmic endeavours while leading to Salvation. ==Departments, centres and schools== Department of Electronics and Communication Department of Computer Engineering ===Engineering departments=== * Architecture * Chemical Engineering * Civil Engineering * Computer Science & Engineering * Electrical Engineering * Electronics and Communication Engineering * Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Engineering * Mechanical Engineering * Indian Institute of Information Technology, Kota (temporary campus) \u2013 Computer Science Engineering and Electronics & Communication Engineering ===Centres=== * Energy and Environment * Earthquake and Disaster Mitigation Centre * Innovation and Incubation Centre * Advance Materials Research Centre * Tribology Laboratory * Electronics & ICT Academy * Stones ===Science departments=== * Applied Biology * Mathematics * Physics (Photonics and Electronics ) * Chemistry ===Allied departments=== * Humanities and Social Sciences * Department of Physical Education ==Campus== Hostel No. 9 (Aurobindo Hostel) Aravali Hills covered in clouds, Hostel 9 MNIT's 317-acre campus is located in Jaipur, Rajasthan, approximately 2.5 miles (4 km) from Jaipur International Airport.
