The school, founded in 1969, was designed to emulate a small college campus, with a large central \"quad\" and an open campus policy. ECR serves portions of Woodland Hills and West Hills and also maintains a sizable \"traveling\" student population from other areas of the district. ECR's Academic Performance Index was 832 out of 1,000 in 2012. El Camino Real Senior High in WOODLAND HILLS, CA | Best High Schools | US News On March 31, 2009, El Camino Real High School became a California Distinguished School.
