    "text": "Thicker Than Water is a 1999 film directed by Richard Cummings Jr. and starring a host of rappers and urban entertainers such as Fat Joe, Mack 10, Ice Cube, MC Eiht, Big Pun, and others. The film contains rappers from both the East and the West Coast, as it was made after the end of the East Coast- West Coast feud. ==Plot== In Los Angeles, two rival gang leaders are also trying to be music producers. When DJ's (Mack 10) equipment shorts out and Lonzo (Fat Joe) is cut out of the action by a record producer, the two join forces, which also requires a tentative peace between gangs. With backing from Gator (CJ Mac), a smooth New Orleans drug king, DJ and Lonzo start drug dealing, organizing their gangs into pushers. Just as their finances are looking up, one of Gator's team pulls a double cross and two of DJ and Lonzo's gang bangers start a shooting war. Can the erstwhile music producers salvage anything of their bond or their plans? ==Cast== *Mack 10 as Darius \"DJ\" Stone *Fat Joe as Charles \"Lonzo\" Medina *Ice Cube as Fred \"Slink\" Stone *MC Eiht as Lil' Ant *CJ Mac as Gator *Big Pun (as Big Punisher) as Punny *K-Mack as Tyree *Tom'ya Bowden as Leyla *Kidada Jones as Brandy *Krayzie Bone as Man on Plane *Flesh-N-Bone as Man on Plane *Bad Azz as Badass ==Soundtrack== A soundtrack containing hip hop music was released on October 5, 1999 by Priority Records.
