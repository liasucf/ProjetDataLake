    "text": "On the morning of August 29, 2016, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant conducted a powerful car suicide bombing on an army camp in Aden, Yemen, killing 72 and wounding 67. The attack took place as new military recruits were signing up in a local government school. Despite Al-Qaeda's large presence in the area, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant were the only ones to claim responsibility for the bombing. ISIS claimed responsibility and referred to the bombing as a \"martyrdom operation\". ==Incident== On 29 August 2016, recruits at an army training camp had queued in line for breakfast, which was brought into the compound by a truck. According to military sources, the recruitment was for the Yemeni and Saudi Arabian led coalition army, fighting the Huthi rebels at the northern border with Saudi Arabia. The suicide bomber, a suspected member of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, entered the compound behind this truck. He then drove his vehicle into the gathering of people, blowing himself up in a suicide car bomb attack and killing himself. The blast also caused a roof to collapse, burying recruits beneath it. ==See also== *List of terrorist incidents, 2016 *Yemeni civil war (2015\u2013present) *23 May 2016 Yemen bombings *June 2016 Mukalla attacks *May 2016 Yemen police bombings ==References== Category:2016 murders in Yemen Category:2016 in military history Category:2016 murders in Asia Category:Suicide car and truck bombings in Yemen Category:Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present) Category:Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Yemen Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in 2016 Category:August 2016 crimes in Asia Category:Terrorist incidents in Yemen in 2016 Category:Mass murder in 2016 Category:21st century in Aden Category:Suicide bombings in 2016 ",
