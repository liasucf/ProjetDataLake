His name means \"Thomas of Kempen\", Kempen being his home town. He was a member of the Modern Devotion, a spiritual movement during the late medieval period, and a follower of Geert Groote and Florens Radewyns, the founders of the Brethren of the Common Life.Van Engen, John, Sisters and Brothers of the Common Life: The Devotio Moderna and the World of the Later Middle Ages, (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008). ==Life== Thomas was born in Kempen in the Rhineland. His surname at birth was Hemerken (or Hammerlein), meaning the family's profession, \"little hammer,\" Latinized into \"Malleolus.\" His father, Johann, was a blacksmith and his mother, Gertrud, was a schoolmistress. In 1392, Thomas followed his brother, Johann, to Deventer in the Netherlands in order to attend the noted Latin school there. While attending this school, Thomas encountered the Brethren of the Common Life, followers of Gerard Groote's Modern Devotion. He attended school in Deventer from 1392 to 1399. After leaving school, Thomas went to the nearby city of Zwolle to visit his brother again, after Johann had become the prior of the Monastery of Mount St. Agnes there. This community was one of the canons regular of the Congregation of Windesheim, founded by disciples of Groote in order to provide a way of life more in keeping with the norms of monastic life of the period. Thomas himself entered Mount St. Agnes in 1406. He was not ordained a priest, however, until almost a decade later. He became a prolific copyist and writer. Thomas received Holy Orders in 1413Scully, 1912. and was made sub-prior of the monastery in 1429. His first tenure of office as subprior was interrupted by the exile of the community from Agnetenberg (1429). A dispute had arisen in connection with an appointment to the vacant See of Utrecht. Pope Martin V rejected the nomination of Bishop- elect Rudolf van Diepholt, and imposed an interdict. The Canons remained in exile in observance of the interdict until the question was settled (1432). During this time, Thomas was sent to Arnhem to care for his ailing brother. He remained there until his brother died in November, 1432. Otherwise, Thomas spent his time between devotional exercises in writing and in copying manuscripts. He copied the Bible no fewer than four times, one of the copies being preserved at Darmstadt, Germany, in five volumes. In its teachings he was widely read and his works abound with biblical quotations, especially from the New Testament. As subprior he was charged with instructing novices, and in that capacity wrote four booklets between 1420 and 1427, later collected and named after the title of the first chapter of the first booklet: The Imitation of Christ. Thomas More said it was one of the three books everybody ought to own.\"Thomas \u00e0 Kempis\", Christian History, August 8, 2008 Thirteen translations of the Imitatio Christi and three paraphrases in English seem to have been published between 1500 and 1700 Crane, D. (1975). English Translations of the Imitatio Christi in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries. Recusant History, 13(2), 79-100. doi:10.1017/S0034193200032489. Thomas died near Zwolle in 1471. ==Works== Opera spirituale, 1568. Thomas \u00e0 Kempis wrote the biographies of New Devotion members\u2014Gerard Groote, Floris Radewijns, Jan van de Gronde, and Jan Brinckerinck. His important works include a series of sermons to the novices of St. Augustine Monastery, including Prayers and Meditations on the Life of Christ, Meditations on the Incarnation of Christ, Of True Compunction of Heart, Soliloquy of the Soul, Garden of Roses, Valley of Lilies, and a Life of St. Lidwina of Schiedam. Kempis's 1441 autograph manuscript of The Imitation of Christ is available in the Biblioth\u00e8que Royale in Brussels (shelfmark: MS 5455-61). ==Quotations== The following quotes are attributed to him: :\"Without the Way, there is no going, :Without the Truth, there is no knowing, :Without the Life, there is no living.\" :\"If thou wilt receive profit, read with humility, simplicity, and faith, and seek not at any time the fame of being learned.\" :\"At the Day of Judgement we shall not be asked what we have read, but what we have done.\" \u2014 The Imitation of Christ, Book I, ch. 3 :\"For man proposes, but God disposes\" \u2014 The Imitation of Christ, Book I, ch. 19 :\"If, however, you seek Jesus in all things, you will surely find Him. \" \u2014 The Imitation of Christ, Book II, ch. 7 :\"In angello cum libello\" (with slight variations), \"In a little corner with a little book\" ::\u2014 Shortened form of a motto often ascribed to, or associated with, Thomas a Kempis. The complete saying as reported by an early biographer is a mixture of Latin and Dutch and runs as follows: \"In omnibus requiem quaesivi, sed non inveni, nisi in hoexkens ende boexkens\", \"I have sought everywhere for peace, but I have found it not, save in nooks and in books.\"See F.A. Wright & T.A. Sinclair, A history of later Latin literature (1931), p. 361. Franciscus Tolensis, Vita Thomae a Kempis, 12: \"Ostenditur adhuc ejus effigies, sed admodum deformata poen\u00e8que obliterata, cum hoc insigni symbolo, In omnibus requiem quaesivi, sed non inveni, nisi in hoexkens ende boexkens: Hoc est, in abditis recessibus & libellulis.\" (Thomae a Kempis opera omnia, ed. Henricus Sommalius, 1759 edition, I, p. 29) ==Veneration== A monument was dedicated to his memory in the presence of the archbishop of Utrecht in St Michael's Church, Zwolle, on November 11, 1897. In 1964, this church closed, causing his shrine to be moved to a new St. Michael's Church outside the centre of Zwolle. In 2005, this church also closed and his shrine was moved to the Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-ten- Hemelopneming kerk (Assumption of Mary church) in the centre of Zwolle. ==Notes== == References == *This article incorporates Public Domain material from the New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Vol. VI: Innocents \u2014 Liudger, Schaff, Philip. * * * * * * ==External links== *Read Imitation of Christ online *Quotes from Thomas \u00e0 Kempis * * * * Imitation of Christ in PDF * Devotio Moderna Category:1380 births Category:1471 deaths Category:People from the Electorate of Cologne Category:German expatriates in the Netherlands Category:Augustinian canons Category:People from Zwolle Category:Medieval German theologians Category:15th-century Roman Catholic theologians Category:15th-century Christian mystics Category:Dutch Roman Catholic theologians Category:Dutch Roman Catholic priests Category:German Roman Catholic priests Category:15th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:Canonical Augustinian theologians Category:Roman Catholic mystics Category:Devotio Moderna Category:Medieval European scribes Category:Pre- Reformation Anglican saints Category:Medieval Christian devotional writers Category:Burials in Overijssel Category:Dutch male writers Category:German male non-fiction writers Category:15th-century German people Category:15th- century German writers Category:15th-century Christian theologians Category:15th-century German theologians Category:15th-century Latin writers Category:15th-century biographers Category:German biographers Category:Dutch biographers Category:Male biographers Category:Christian hagiographers ",
