    "text": "Hiyya Rofe ( 1620) was rabbi of Safed. Having studied Talmud under Solomon Sagis and Cabala under Hayyim Vital, Hiyya was ordained in accordance with the old system (\"semikah\") reintroduced into Palestine by Jacob Berab. In 1612 Hiyya gave his approbation to Issachar Baer Eylenburg's \"Be'er Sheba'.\" Most of Hiyya's works have been lost; the remainder were published by his son, Me\u00efr Rofe, under the title \"Ma'aseh \u1e24iyya\" (Venice, 1652), containing novell\u00e6 on several of the Talmudic treatises, and twenty-seven responsa. These were revised by Moses Zacuto, who added a preface. == References == Category:16th- century births Category:1620 deaths Category:17th-century rabbis ",
