It is located off the eastern tip of Baffin Island's Blunt Peninsula, close to the mouth of Frobisher Bay. It has an area of and a coastline of 206 km. The local Inuktitut name for the island is Takuligjuaq. Loks Land was the site of one of the stations in the Distant Early Warning Line radar defence network, and had the code number BAF-4A. The island was visited by Martin Frobisher and is named for Michael Lok, a London financier who was one of the patrons of Frobisher's Arctic expeditions of the 1570s. Frobisher's first expedition found ore which was purported to contain gold, leading to a second and third expedition which failed to find any of the precious metal. These later speculative ventures almost bankrupted Lok. ==External links== *Michael Lok *DEW Line stations Category:Islands of Baffin Island Category:Uninhabited islands of Qikiqtaaluk Region Category:Islands of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago Category:Islands of Frobisher Bay Category:Former populated places in the Qikiqtaaluk Region ",
