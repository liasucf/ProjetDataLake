Today, the markets are administered by the Baltimore Public Market Corporation, which was established in 1995 as a non- profit organization. ==History== In 1751, twenty years after the founding of Baltimore Town, the first public market house was introduced. Twelve years later, the first market was constructed. At the peak of their operation, there were eleven markets across the city. Responsibility for the markets interchanged to the Baltimore Comptroller's Office in 1857, and then transferred again to the Mayor's Office in 1983. ==Current Markets== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
