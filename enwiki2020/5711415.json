    "text": "The Vekoma Junior Coaster is a model of steel roller coaster built by Vekoma. It is commonly referred to as a Roller Skater due to the roller skate shaped cars found on some of the installations. ==Design and operation== The track layouts for the two most common models. Most Vekoma Junior Coasters consist of a single train made up of several cars, each with a single row of riders. Some, such as Flight of the Hippogriff at Islands of Adventure in Orlando, operate with two trains. There are three basic models (85 meters, 207 meters, and 335 meters), although Vekoma also provides custom models. Instead of the chain lift found on most roller coasters, Vekoma Junior Coasters usually use friction wheels to carry the train up the lift hill. ==Installations== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
