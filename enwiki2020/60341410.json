It was recorded and mixed at Moonlight Mile Recordings in Jersey City, New Jersey, by Mike Moebius, and mastered at Joe Lambert Mastering in Jersey City by Joe Lambert. Gold Glitter Shoes contains six original songs, and a cover of \"We Got the Beat\" by the Go-Go's. The album draws comparison to the music of Joan Jett. Several of the songs on the album appear on Rock N Roll Hi Fives' debut album Re-introducing the RocknRoll Hi- Fives. ==Reception== A review of Gold Glitter Shoes in Star-News describes the record as \"dipp[ing] its finger in glam rock and a little pop-punk, all led by Eilee's sugar-and-snarl vocals.\" while likening her voice to \"Debbie Harry with a smidge of Courtney Love.\" CoolDad Music writes \"from the first spaced- out sounds of \"Planets\" the edges of my mouth start to curl upwards. \"What was I even worrying about again?\" I think to myself as Eilee and Joe Centeno sing about narrowing the hundred-million mile distance between two people down to an actual planetary collision.\" ==Tracklisting== ==Personnel== *Eilee Centeno \u2013 vocals *Evren Centeno \u2013 drums *Gloree Centeno \u2013 bass *Joe Centeno \u2013 guitars and backing vocals ==References== ;Citations ;Bibliography * * * Category:2015 EPs Category:Rock-and-roll albums Category:Rock N Roll Hi Fives albums ",
