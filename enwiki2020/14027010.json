In 2004, Smith was project Director of the Kigali Memorial Centre, the genocide memorial museum and education centre in Kigali, Rwanda. Aegis was commissioned by Kigali City Council to establish the Kigali Memorial Centre, which opened in 2004 and still operates today. Smith is a member of the United States delegation to the Inter-governmental Taskforce on Holocaust Education, Remembrance and Research (ITF), founded by Sweden, the US and the UK on the personal initiative of the then Swedish Prime Minister, G\u00f6ran Persson. He was a member of the British delegation from 1998, when the ITF was founded, moving to the American delegation in 2009 following appointment to the USC Shoah Foundation Institute (see below). Over 20 countries are now part of the ITF. Smith was an advisor to G\u00f6ran Persson's series of intergovernmental conferences, the Stockholm International Forum. The four conferences addressed, The Holocaust (2000); Combatting Intolerance (2001), Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation (2002), Preventing Genocide (2004). One early outcome of the work of the ITF was the development of the UK's national Holocaust Memorial Day, inaugurated in 2001. Smith played a central role in this and served as an advisor to the Home Office on the Day's development over the years, and was appointed the inaugural Chair of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust in November 2004 when the decision was made that the running of the Day should be handed over to a non- Governmental charitable body. Smith has developed a reputation for his contribution to the field in the UK and abroad. Recognition for his work includes being made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (2000), the Interfaith Gold Medallion (2000), and Honorary Doctorate in Law from the University of Leicester (2007) and an Honorary Doctor of Letters from Nottingham Trent University (2010). Smith's publications include Making Memory: Creating Britain's First Holocaust Centre, Forgotten Places: The Holocaust and the Remnants of Destruction, and The Holocaust and the Christian World, which he co-edited with Carol Rittner and Irena Steinfeldt. Smith also co-produced \"Death March: A Survivor's Story\", which was broadcast on BBC Two and BBC Four. He is currently working on a memoir of his interviews with Holocaust survivor Pinchas Gutter. On 15 August 2009, Smith took up the post of Executive Director of the USC Shoah Foundation Institute, the archive of Holocaust survivor testimonies initiated by Steven Spielberg in 1994. == References == == External links == * www.usc.edu/vhi * www.theholocaustcentre.net * www.aegistrust.org * www.kigalimemorialcentre.org * www.hmd.org.uk Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:People from Nottinghamshire Category:Alumni of the University of London Category:Alumni of the University of Birmingham Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire ",
