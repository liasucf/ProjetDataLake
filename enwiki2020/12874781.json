    "text": "Fingertips are a Pop/Rock band from Portugal formed in 2002. They launched their debut album \"All 'Bout Smoke 'n Mirrors\" in 2003 and achieved #1 on radio airplay with the first single \"Melancholic Ballad\" where it also included \"Picture Of My Own\" as the soundtrack of a major TV commercial and \"How Do You Know Me\". \"Catharsis\", is the second album released in 2006. Singles are \"You're Gone\", \"Cause to Love You\" (#1 radio airplay) and \"Move Faster\". In 2009, Fingertips released \"Magic Heart EP\" and single \"Do It (Magic Colors)\" achieved #1 radio airplay and a #1 on iTunes. They've performed in Rock in Rio Lisbon, Vilar Mouros Festival and shared the stage with Queen and Paul Rodgers, The Corrs, George Michael, Nelly Furtado and The Cure. By the end of 2009 the vocalist Z\u00e9 Manuel had departed from the band. In 2010, Fingertips set a new course and choose Joana Gomes to be the new voice of the band. They released two albums \"Venice\" (2011) and \"2\" (2012). In 2015, Fingertips traveled to Los Angeles and the city had become the epicentre of the band's inspiration when they were recording at The Ballroom Studios and East West Studios with Mark Needham (Imagine Dragons, The Killers, Fleetwood Mac). In 2018, Fingertips announced the return of Z\u00e9 Manuel to the band to celebrate the 15\u00ba anniversary and released the first single of the year \"My Everyday\". == History == ===2002\u20132009: Formation and early years=== It all started in March 2003 when a brand new Portuguese band delivered their debut album to the stores. That album was called \"All 'Bout Smoke N' Mirrors\". The band, Fingertips. The band, formed by Z\u00e9 Manuel and Rui Saraiva, began to walk their way in the modern Portuguese music scene. Nothing to chance, nothing by accident. All with intention, all for wanting. With the need to win and conquer their place in the sun. In English. For Portugal and the World! In \"All 'Bout Smoke N' Mirrors\", all lyrics were written by Z\u00e9 Manuel, who despite being 16 years old, already showed a very advanced poetic maturity in which he mixed, in a simple way, his melodramatic side, nostalgic, ironic and dreamy. These songs were composed by Rui Saraiva and Helder de Matos in a simple but bold way, fitting the poems perfectly. \"All 'Bout Smoke N' Mirrors\" was one of the biggest hits of 2003, with two of the most downloaded/listened singles on Portuguese radio stations: \"Melancholic Ballad (For The Leftlovers)\" and \"How Do You Know Me\". But not only sound made the Fingertips. The image is an important tool and the band by knowing this, bet heavily on that. Not only in the promotional photos, but also in the visual care of the videos \"Melancholic Ballad (For The Leftlovers)\" and 3D innovation with \"How Do You Know Me\". \"Melancholic Ballad (for the Leftlovers)\", directed by Jo\u00e3o Costa Menezes and with the special participation of actress D\u00e9bora Monteiro, was selected for International Festivals in Torrelavega (Spain), Leicester and London (England) and Clermont Ferrand (France). This song was responsible for all the madness that invaded the Portuguese radio and television in the year 2004: in the radio, the song reached the 1st place of the most played songs and the band won the best award for national artist on the Nova Era radio station; in television, the theme was part of the soundtrack of the telenovela \"Celebridade\" and made the band to be nominated for two golden globes in the categories of Best Song and Best Group. In 2004 the song \"Picture Of My Own\" was the theme chosen by a Portuguese beer brand to serve as a soundtrack for their new campaign. A single action that stopped all National TV channels at 22:00 in April 2004, presented the biggest advertisement (3.00 min) ever made in Portugal. During this year, Fingertips opened the first part of The Corrs concert, in the Municipal Stadium of Braga, they acted in the main stage of the Vilar de Mouros Festival. To end the year, they played the New Year with Nelly Furtado. For the rest of the year, Fingertips presented their audiences with a series of acoustic concerts under the title N 'Outros Luares, an intimate concert and sharing of emotions. On 19 January 2005, the Fingertips recorded their first live DVD, based on an acoustic concert given at nightclub ACT Porto. In July 2005, they ascend the stage in the Stadium of the Restelo opening the concert for the legendary English band Queen, in a tour with Paul Rodgers. Fingertips began the recordings of a new album released in March 2006: Catharsis (Greek word meaning explosion of feelings). Continuing along the path of the debut album, the second, and always difficult album \"Catharsis\" confirmed the Fingertips not as a promise of national music but as a certainty. Proof of this is the single \"Cause To Love You\", a ballad in the style of the Fingertips: melancholy, passionate, intense and captivating. In October 2006 and after a summer with the important participation at Rock in Rio Lisboa, the Fingertips present another single \"Move Faster\", in addition to the normal version the band decided to invite Nuno Nobre aka Hydro, to make a remix of the theme. Connecting the 80s to today's dance floors was the challenge that the Fingertips put to Nuno Nobre, who masterfully worked the Rock-Electro-Dance triangle and marked the remix with a mix of notable influences. May 2007 is the month chosen to release the double single \"Outsider N\u00ba 12\" and the ballad \"You're Gone (Everybody Knows That)\" as new bets for the promotion of the album \"Catharsis\". The reason the band decided to release this double single is that these themes were chosen among fans as their favorites. During the same month the band debuts on its official website the music of the song \"18th March\", recorded on the occasion of Portugal Fashion. Also in May, another Fingertips surprise of the year comes as they are invited for the opening act at George Michael's debut concert in Portugal. 2008 is the year of the first Fingertips live album: \"Live ACT\" that comes as the fulfillment of a promise, by bringing the live record of the unforgettable Christmas concert the band held on 21 December 2007 at ACT Porto. It was a unique event, materialized in support of the group to the Portuguese Association of Missing Children, for which it reversed part of the revenues. From revelation in 2003, the Fingertips had become, once and for all, one of the most interesting and fundamental Portuguese groups, anchored in the voice and poetry of Z\u00e9 Manuel, showing in all their fullness in this concert captured live, under the title \"Live ACT\". 2009 marks the return of Fingertips to the creation of new themes and musical charts. \"Do It (Magic Colors)\", accelerates the rotation in Portuguese radio stations and in April 2009 reached the 1st place on national airplay and 1st place on iTunes. But 2009 was a turbulent year, after the first places hit, singer Z\u00e9 Manuel announces to the press in November his departure from the Fingertips. ===2010\u20132017: A New Voice=== In 2010, the Fingertips led by their lead composer Rui Saraiva decided to take a new turn. The need for a new voice, new sounds, a new image and attitude that complemented the group was emerging and they went in search of that voice. On 24 February 2010, from the partnership between LG Electronics, RFM (one of the most heard Portuguese radios) and the Fingertips launched an unprecedented contest. The objective was to find the vocalist of the band, led by Rui Saraiva. The RFM / LG Challenge toured eight cities in the country in the first phase, with a set of hearings for the candidates who signed up for the competition. On 8 May 2010, the final with 6 finalists was held in S\u00e3o Pedro do Sul, Viseu district, with Joana Gomes becoming the new voice of the Fingertips. With the arrival of Joana, the band finalized some ideas they had in the studio and released the advance single \"Simple Words\", their first song recorded with Joana Gomes. \"Simple Words\" puts the new melodic and intense sound of the band on the horizon. A ballad with the sweet and sensual voice of Joan, where you can listen to a melodic piano. The guitar solo brings back memories of past decades and delicate cuts with passion, in an individual and intense chorus. Composed by producers Rui Saraiva and Helder de Matos and marks the arrival of lyricist Virg\u00edlio Fino, a Londoner with big Portuguese roots. On 30 May 2010, the Fingertips took the stage at Rock in Rio Lisbon with the new vocalist Joana. In the concert, two special guests participated: the guitarist Alexandre Almeida and the Brazilian musician/singer Z\u00e9 Ricardo, who performed the first single from the band \"Simple Words\" as a duet. Between months in studio and concerts in Portugal, the album \"Venice\" was released worldwide on the music market in March 2011. The Fingertips presented the work \"Venice\" with a special concert during Portugal Fashion 2011, with an image created by the designer J\u00falio Torcato, (friend of the band for many years) because Portugal Fashion is a place of fashion, and because fashion it is also what you hear. \"Venice\" includes the singles \"Simple Words\", \"Thinking About You\" and \"Dreaming of the Moon\". The song \"Dreaming of the Moon\" was remixed by DJ Pete Tha Zouk. The energy and spirit of the elements of the band made them inspired and there was still a lot of material to work on. The ideas were more and the need to put them in the studio was the main thought of the band. After six months in the studio, the album \"2\" arrives to the public on 5 March 2012. The album \"2\", the band's second album with Joana, means the duality that exists daily: right and wrong, night and day, white and black, silence and noise. Where music is emotion, communication and relationship. \"Running Out of Time\" was the first single from the album \"2\" and showed us that in our day and age we live against time, that it passes through us without realizing it and that sometimes we need to stop, calm down and let it go with the flow. A theme that reflects well the band's daily life and the stage that they went through, between work, stress and without being able to stop and have quiet moments. Basically, living against the time that insists on passing quickly. The band started a tour in Portugal by visiting more than 20 cities, from March 2012 to September 2012. Each concert in each city demonstrates a history, the history of the band, the history of life and the history of each of us. The strenuous energy and liveliness experienced in each concert is shown on the attitude of the band, who don't want to make music for the masses, but rather Music in its true sense and suitable to all those who have gotten used to listening to the great hits of this band with quality and good taste. This tour was supported by RFM radio station, SIC television and partners PT/TMN, MusicBox, Tiffosi and Terras do Demo. Fingertips is music, is communication, is emotion and much more than that. The solidarity aspect associated with music is a social commitment that the band defies and leads to know several institutions/foundations throughout their tour \"2\". Fingertips showed that music and solidarity can and should be united, helping those who need it most. To this end, they created the solidarity ticket, which consists of a discount of the ticket for the concert for people who bring a food package that will be reverted to the aided institutions. Caritas, Red Cross, Acreditar, Bank food against hunger among many others were the institutions included in this \"2\" tour. In October 2012 the Fingertips made their first appearance in Asia with several concerts in Shanghai and Hangzhou. In 2013 the Fingertips inspired by their Asia experience begin to prepare a new path for the international promotion of their music. They develop a new creative work in their studio and receive the support of Safta Jaffery (Muse, Stone Roses, Coldplay, Radiohead) and Ron Saint Germain (Jimi Hendrix, U2, Michael Jackson, Red Hot Chili Peppers, etc.). They are invited to create the official song of Eurogym 2013. The song \"Let's Share\" was presented at the presentation ceremony of the Stadium in Coimbra. In 2014 the Fingertips began the international promotion with concerts in Brazil (S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro) and in China at the West Bund Music Festival. In 2015 they travel to Los Angeles to record new original material with producer Mark Needham (The Killers, Imagine Dragons, Fleetwood Mac, Moby, etc.). Meanwhile, the international promotion continues with showcases in Los Angeles, Toronto, Brighton, Amsterdam, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo, Shanghai, Berlin and other cities. Still in the year of 2015 they publish the single \"Out of Control\", produced and mixed by Mark Needham in The Ballroom in Hollywood. Many international radio airplay singles are featured (KROQ Los Angeles, CA), (KNDD Seattle, WA), (WRUR Rochester, NY), (KKDO Sacramento, CA), (Triple MMM, Australia) among many others. They return to Shanghai to film the video of the single \"Out of Control\" with director Vasco Mendes. In 2016 they began a trip through Europe, passing through Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Berlin where they film a video documentary under the direction of director Vasco Mendes. They return to Hollywood in April to record with Mark Needham the single \"Kiss Me\" and invited the director Vasco Mendes to produce the new video, taking advantage of the landscapes of Hollywood, Santa Monica and Venice Beach. Still in 2016 the Fingertips presented at the Casa da M\u00fasica in Porto a concert to the Portuguese audience that mirrors the creative work they have developed in recent months. In the year 2017 they edited the single \"Somebody New\" and chosen their hometown Viseu to film the official video. ===2018-present: Return of Z\u00e9 Manuel=== 2018 arrives as a year that promises to be very special to the fans.
