The decree dissolved the former Benefices and Parishes of: * Harlech and Llanfair juxta Harlech * Llanfihangel-y-Traethau and Llandecwyn * LLanenddwyn (otherwise Dyffryn) with Llanddwywe * Llanbedr with Llandanwg The former Churches within Bro Ardudwy Uchaf were then raised to the status of Parish Churches within the area and consisted of: * St Tanwg's Church, Harlech * St Michael's Church, Ynys * St Tecwyn's Church, Llandecwyn * Christ Church, Talsarnau * St Peter's Church, Llanbedr * St Mary's Church, Llanfair * St Tanwg's Church, Llandanwg * St Enddwyn's Church, Dyffryn * St Ddwywe's Church, Llanddwywe The new Ministry Area was overseen by a Ministry Area Council that had the same powers as the former PCC's of the former Parishes. ==Enlargement== On 3 September 2015 the Bishop of Bangor signed another decree that formed Bro Ardudwy and removed the portion of 'Uchaf' from its name. The new area of Bro Ardudwy included all of the previous Churches but also included the Churches of the Benefice and Parishes of Llanaber with Barmouth and Caerdeon with Bontddu which were all raised to the status of Parish Churches.
