It is written by Stuart Rutherford, Jonathan Morduch, Orlanda Ruthven, and Daryl Collins. == Background == The book is the culmination of 10 years of research into the financial lives of the lowest classes of Bangladesh, India, and South Africa\u2014with a focus on those living on less than two dollars a day per person. == Reception == In 2015, Mark Zuckerberg announced that he highly recommended everyone read Portfolios of the Poor. He wrote: \"It's mind-blowing that almost half the world \u2014 almost 3 billion people \u2014 live on $2.50 a day or less. More than one billion people live on $1 a day or less. This book explains how these families invest their money to best support themselves. I hope reading this provides some insight into ways we can all work to support them better as well.\" The New Yorker reported \"while the authors do offer prescriptions for how to expand those options, it\u2019s their scrupulous attention to actual behavior that makes this book invaluable.\" Reuters wrote \"Portfolios of the Poor includes concrete ideas for moving forward. Getting there, though, requires us to first step back and listen.\" \"The book's methodology and conclusions are fascinating,\" Publishers Weekly concluded. == References == == External links == * Category:2009 non-fiction books Category:Business books Category:Books about poverty Category:Princeton University Press books ",
