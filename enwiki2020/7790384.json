    "text": "Waldo Alonso Ponce Carrizo (born 4 December 1982 in Los Andes, Chile) is a Chilean football defender. ==Club career== ===Universidad de Chile=== Ponce made his professional debut with Universidad de Chile in 2001. In his three years with regular play with Universidad de Chile, Ponce displayed good aerial ability both in defence and attack. This, combined with his strong and accurate free kicks, led Ponce to be loaned to German team VfL Wolfsburg, being this his first international club. In this club, Ponce only played two league matches. Ponce returned to Universidad de Chile at the end of 2004. He was immediately inserted into the starting lineup and was an integral part of Universidad de Chile's making an appearance in the 2005 Copa Libertadores. Ponce reached the final of the tournament Clausura 2005 but his team lost when he missed the final penalty which was saved by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Buljubasich. In 2007, Ponce lived one of his best moments on Universidad de Chile, but on 11 April 2007, he was injured during a training of the club. The player was nearly three months injured, however he fully recovered in September 2007. ===V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield=== In February 2008, Ponce joined V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield of Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n for a three-year contract with a transfer fee of $800,000. He was frequently injured and missed many matches, but on 13 April 2008, he made his V\u00e9lez debut against San Mart\u00edn de San Juan, in a 2\u20130 V\u00e9lez's victory. Ponce scored his first team goal against Gimnasia La Plata, in a 2\u20131 loss. Due to the departure of Hern\u00e1n Pellerano to UD Almer\u00eda, Ponce became a more consistent player in V\u00e9lez' lineup. But he got injured once again, and missed the Torneo Clausura tournament for one month. The injury allowed Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi to take his place in the starting line-up. In the Torneo Clausura 2009, Ponce played very few matches, but V\u00e9lez were crowned champions. During the Torneo Clausura, he scored two goals in the same match against Tigre, for 3\u20130 V\u00e9lez victory, being the man of the match. During the summer of 2010, he was released from the club. After nearly signing with Premier League Wigan Athletic, he signed with O'Higgins on a one-year deal. ===Universidad Cat\u00f3lica and Spain=== On 4 February 2010, Ponce joined Universidad Cat\u00f3lica on a six-month loan for O'Higgins. On 5 February 2010, Ponce was officially presented as player of Cat\u00f3lica. Shortly after the player's presentation, the coach of the club, Marco Antonio Figueroa, expressed that he had not asked the player to join the team. On 17 February 2010, he made his Cat\u00f3lica debut against his former club O'Higgins, in a 1\u20130 Catolica away loss. Seven days later on 24 February 2010, Ponce made his 2010 Copa Libertadores debut against the Brazilian club Flamengo, in a 2\u20130 loss. After the Chilean earthquake on 27 February of the same year, he played against his former club Universidad de Chile for the Libertadores, in a 2\u20132 draw. However the club failed to advance to the second stage, and he ended with zero goals in six appearances in the Copa Libertadores. Because of his good performance at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Ponce returned to O'Higgins, but was loaned to Liga BBVA club Racing de Santander on 31 August 2010 for a fee of $400.000 on a six-month deal. He made his Racing debut against Real Sociedad in a friendly match with three times, in a 4\u20133 Racing's victory. On 3 October 2010, Ponce made his official Racing debut against Villarreal CF, in a 2\u20130 defeat. He was on the bench on many occasions, and he played his second league match against Real Madrid. ===Cruz Azul=== In January 2011, Ponce was supposed to play for O'Higgins, but was then transferred to Cruz Azul of Mexican Primera Divisi\u00f3n for a one-year deal. On 8 January 2011, Ponce made his Cruz Azul debut against Estudiantes Tecos on a 4\u20131 victory for the Cementeros. ==International career== Ponce made his debut for the Chile national team at the 2006 Pacific Cup against Peru. On 24 March 2006, Ponce scored in a friendly match against Paraguay with a free kick for a 3\u20132 Chile victory. He would have been a member of Chile's 2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica squad, but because of an injury during a training session with Universidad de Chile he missed the tournament. During the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification, Ponce was a consistent player in Chile's lineup. He scored his first official goal during a qualification match in a 4\u20132 win against Colombia. In June 2010, he was selected for Chile's FIFA World Cup 2010 squad. Ponce played in the opening match for Chile at the World Cup against Honduras, a 1\u20130 Chile victory. In the third group match against Spain, he received his second yellow card and received a one-match ban, missing the Round of 16 match against Brazil, which Chile lost 3\u20130, eliminating them from the tournament. Shortly after Chile's World Cup participation, the Chilean team were presented at the Moneda Palace by Chilean president Sebastian Pi\u00f1era, and Ponce along with his team, were presented with the Bicentenario medal. ===International goals=== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! # !!
