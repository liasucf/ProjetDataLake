He then worked at Tetratech Inc. in Southern California as a project engineer conducting environmental impact studies before attending graduate school at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he obtained MS. and Ph.D. degrees in Environmental Engineering as a Rackham Fellow. His academic career started at the University of Iowa, Iowa City, where he also served as Associate Director for the Center for Biotechnology and Bioprocessing. Alvarez is the 2012 Clarke Prize laureate for outstanding research in water science and technology, and also won the 2014 AAEES Grand Prize for excellence in environmental engineering and science. Past honors include President of the Association of Environmental Engineers (AEESP); the AEESP Frontiers in Research Award, the AEESP Perry L. McCarty Founder\u2019s Award for sustained and outstanding contributions to environmental engineering education and practice; the WEF McKee Medal for Groundwater Protection; the SERDP cleanup project of the year award; the Brown and Caldwell Lifetime Achievement Award for Site Remediation; and various best paper awards with his students. Alvarez has served on the EPA\u2019s Science Advisory BoardEPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board and the National Science Foundation Engineering Directorate Advisory Committee,National Science Foundation Engineering Directorate Advisory Committee and as Associate Editor of Environmental Science and Technology. Alvarez\u2019s research interests include environmental implications and applications of nanotechnology, bioremediation, fate and transport of toxic chemicals, water footprint of biofuels, water treatment and reuse, and antibiotic resistance control. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in recognition for his pedagogical and practical contributions to bioremediation and environmental nanotechnology. Alvarez is also an honorary professor at Nankai University, Zheijang University, and Chinese Academy of Sciences, and adjunct professor at the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina in Florianopolis, Brazil.\"Pedro J.
