Ko\u1e5f\u1e5favai (), also spelled Kotravai or Korravai, is the goddess of war and victory in the Tamil traditions. She is the mother of Murugan \u2013 the god of war, and the wife of Shiva. She is also the mother goddess and the goddess of fertility, agriculture and hunters. In the latter form, she is sometimes referred to by other names and epithets in the Tamil tradition of South India and Sri Lanka, such as Athaaa, Mari, Suli, and Kavuri. She is among the earliest documented goddesses in the Tamil Sangam literature, and also found in later Tamil literature particularly those related to Shaivism and Shaktism. She is mentioned in the many poems in Parip\u0101\u1e6dal , though the dedicated poem to her in among those that have been lost to history. She is mentioned in the Pattuppattu anthology \u2013 the long Tamil poems dated between 300 BCE to 300 CE, including the Ne\u1e6dunalv\u0101\u1e6dai, Maturaikkanci, Poru\u1e47ar\u0101\u1e5f\u1e5fuppa\u1e6dai, and Pa\u1e6d\u1e6di\u1e49app\u0101lai.JV Chelliah (1946), Pattupattu - Ten Tamil Idylls (Tamil Verses with Englilsh Translation), Tamil University (1985 print), pp. xv\u2013xxvi, 1\u201312 In the Tamil epic Silappadikaram (c. 2nd-century), she is described as the wife of Shiva, and the sister of Vishnu.\"Kotravai was perhaps the earliest and the most widely worshipped goddess of the ancient Tamil people.\" Tiwari (1985). Depending on the context and her fierceness, she is identified with Durga-Mahisasuramardini and Kali goddess avatars of Parvati in other parts of India. This may be the result of a fusion of regional goddesses during the ancient proto-literate era into a unified goddess version over the centuries, in the form of a pan-Hindu deity. Her name is derived from the Tamil word korram, which means \"victory, success, bravery\". The earliest references to Kotravai are found in the ancient Tamil grammar Tolkappiyam, considered to be the earliest work of the ancient Sangam literature. She is also seen as a mother goddess, a symbol of fertility and success in agriculture. Traditional rural communities offer the first harvest to her. As war goddess who is blood thirsty, some texts such as the Silappadikaram and Ahamnanuru mention that warrior devotees would, in a frenzy, offer their own head to the goddess.

In Tamil Nadu, the blackbuck (Kalaimaan) is considered to be the vehicle of the Hindu goddess Korravai She is sometimes shown as riding a lion, as in the 7th-century Mahishasuramardini mandapa of the Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu.
