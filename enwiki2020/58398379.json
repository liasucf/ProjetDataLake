In 1958, he moved to Barcelona and formed part of the founding team, which also included F\u00e9lix Huerta Herrero, Anton Wurster, Rafael Termes, Juan Ferr\u00e1n Nadal and Carlos Cavall\u00e9.Pampliega Nogu\u00e9s, Javier (2012). \u201cLa historia del IESE: Una gran Business School en Pedralbes.

With Valero, he travelled to numerous educational institutions around Europe to get a firsthand perspective of the best practices in business education. During their visit to the L'\u00c9cole d'Administration des Affaires in Lille, it was decided that Pereira would stay there to finish his teacher training.Valero Vicente, Antonio (2001). \u201cLos comienzos del IESE: el impulso del Beato Josemar\u00eda.\u201d Anuario de Historia de la Iglesia X: 759-771. A year later, he joined IESE's Department of Information and Economic Control as a professor.Torres Olivares, Beatriz (2015). \u201cLa fundaci\u00f3n del Instituto de Estudios Superiores de la Empresa (IESE).\u201d Los or\u00edgenes del IESE. Madrid: LID. p. 118. . In addition to his teaching responsibilities, Pereira actively promoted and developed research at IESE, serving as the university's research director (1959-1964) as well as its director of executive education programs. After serving on the board of directors, he was named the school's dean (1970-1978), succeeding Juan Ginebra Torra.La Vanguardia Espa\u00f1ola (September 17, 1970) \u201cRelevo acad\u00e9mico en el IESE. El nuevo director, profesor Pereira, tom\u00f3 posesi\u00f3n del cargo.\u201d He was known as a leader who listened to the opinions of others, and who surrounded himself with a trustworthy team, making important decisions collaboratively.Heukamp, Franz (April 17, 2018). \u201cFernando Pereira (1930-2018).

His tenure saw the flourishing of the Harvard-IESE Committee and the launch of the IAE Business School in Buenos Aires, which would later become part of the Universidad Austral. He also contributed to the creation of the Instituto Panamericano de Alta Direcci\u00f3n de Empresa (IPADE), which eventually formed part of the Universidad Panamericana de M\u00e9xico. Another milestone in his leadership was the opening of the IESE campus in Madrid in 1974, in order to promote training for business leaders and executives in the Spanish capital. Under his direction, the alumni association grew into a vibrant source of support and advice, and a means of continued contact between current and former students, faculty and academic leadership.Actualidad Econ\u00f3mica (September 30, 1978) \u201cLos empresarios estudian. Veinte a\u00f1os del IESE\u201d, pp.64-66. In 1978, for health reasons, he was replaced as IESE's dean by Juan Antonio P\u00e9rez L\u00f3pez, but remained on the board of directors (1978-1981). Later, he served as associate dean under Pedro Nueno (1981-1992). An avid reader, he was a great connoisseur of English authors such as G.K. Chesterton, C.S. Lewis, R. Knox and H. Newman. == Professor of Accounting == Pereira was a professor of accounting and financial management at IESE for decades, both in the MBA and the executive education programs. In 2001, he was named professor emeritus. As a professor, he had a gift for making complex accounting principles accessible and engaging, able to captivate a full classroom with his rhetorical questions and sense of humor. His book \"Accounting for Management\" is a classic among accounting textbooks. In the prologue, he gives some basic advice for solving complicated problems: > \u00abComplex problems are solved with the help of a pencil, an eraser and a > sheet of paper\u201d The book is aimed at anyone who is not a professional accountant but who requires a knowledge of accounting. While highly practical, it is also academically rigorous, thanks to the author's experience in the private sector and as a professor.La Vanguardia (March 25, 1971) \u201cContabilidad para Direcci\u00f3n\u201d p. 12 == Publications == === Books === * Pereira, F.
