    "text": "Pleurotus ostreatus Gilled fungi with laterally-attached fruiting bodies are said to be pleurotoid (Gr.: pleur\u0113 + \u014dtos + -oid, literally \"side-ear form\" or \"having the likeness of Pleurotus ssp.\"). Pleurotoid fungi are typically wood- decay fungi and are found on dead and dying trees and coarse woody debris. The pleurotoid form is polyphyletic, having evolved a number of times within the Basidiomycota. Many species of pleurotoid fungi are commonly referred to as \"oyster\" mushrooms. Laterally-attached fungi with pores rather than gills are referred to as bracket fungi. ==Genera== Tectella operculata ===Agaricales=== * Cheimonophyllum * Crepidotus * Hohenbuehelia * Hypsizygus * Ossicaulis * Panellus * Phyllotopsis * Pleurocybella \u2014 Angel wings * Pleurotus \u2014 Oyster mushrooms * Resupinatus \u2014 Oysterlings * Schizophyllum * Tectella ===Polyporales=== * Lentinus * Panus ===Russulales=== * Lactifluus - some species * Lentinellus * Russula - some species ==References== ==External links== * * * *Magic Mushrooms Effects & How To Grow Magic Mushrooms Retrieved 2020-10-06. pleurotoid ",
