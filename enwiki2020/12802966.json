The corps was originally formed in 1805 and was reorganized several times until it was dissolved in 1815. ==History== From 1805\u20131807, the corps composed mostly of French troops, and was commanded by Marshals Jean Lannes, \u00c9douard Mortier, Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Lefebvre, and Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na as well as G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Division Anne Jean Marie Ren\u00e9 Savary. ===Polish Corps d'Arm\u00e9e=== In 1812, the V Corps was made up entirely of Polish soldiers from the Duchy of Warsaw under the command of General J\u00f3zef Poniatowski. It was one of several non-French corps of the Grande Arm\u00e9e and at its peak consisted of around 36,000 soldiers. The corps took part in Napoleon's invasion of Russia and fought in the Battle of Smolensk and the Battle of Borodino. The corps suffered heavy casualties during the retreat, but managed to reach Warsaw and was later reinforced with new recruits. In 1813, the corps was sent to Saxony, passing Bohemia. The corps was temporary disbanded with the remaining troops and Poniatowski reassigned to the VIII Corps. ===Revival=== After the disastrous Russian campaign, the V Corps was rebuilt in Magdeburg from newly formed French units in the spring of 1813. These troops were under the command of General Jacques Lauriston. Participating in the War of the Sixth Coalition the corps was disbanded again after Napoleon's abdication. ===War of the Seventh Coalition=== In March 1815, the V Corps was again rebuilt and placed under the command of General Jean Rapp. Ordered to defend the north-eastern frontier of France, it missed the Battle of Waterloo instead winning the Battle of La Suffel. ==Organization== The V Corps varied in strength and organization. In the beginning of each campaign it had: * 14,000 French in 1805 * 18,000 French in 1806\u20131807 * 36,000 Polish in 1812 * 20,000 French in 1813 * 20,000 French in 1815 ==1805== * Infantry Division \u2013 General Louis-Gabriel Suchet * Combined Grenadier Division \u2013 General Nicolas OudinotGeorge Nafziger, Oudinot's Grenadier Advanced Guard Division 8 September 1805, United States Army Combined Arms Center. ** 1st Brigade under G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Brigade Morti\u00e8ret *** 2\u00e9me R\u00e9giment d'Infanterie de Ligne *** 9\u00e9me R\u00e9giment d'Infanterie de Ligne *** 11\u00e9me R\u00e9giment d'Infanterie de Ligne *** 58\u00e9me R\u00e9giment d'Infanterie de Ligne *** 81\u00e9me R\u00e9giment d'Infanterie de Ligne ** 2nd Brigade *** 2\u00e9me R\u00e9giment L\u00e9g\u00e8re *** 3\u00e9me R\u00e9giment L\u00e9g\u00e8re *** 28\u00e9me R\u00e9giment L\u00e9g\u00e8re *** 31\u00e9me R\u00e9giment L\u00e9g\u00e8re ** 3rd Brigade *** 12\u00e9me R\u00e9giment L\u00e9g\u00e8re *** 15\u00e9me R\u00e9giment L\u00e9g\u00e8re * Light Cavalry Division \u2013 General Anne- Fran\u00e7ois-Charles Trelliard, then Antoine Charles Louis de Lasalle ==1806\u20131807== * Infantry Division \u2013 General Louis-Gabriel Suchet * Infantry Division \u2013 General Gazan * Light Cavalry Division \u2013 General Trelliard ==1812== * 16th Infantry Division \u2013 General J\u00f3zef Zaj\u0105czek, then Izydor Krasinski and Franciszek Paszkowski * 17th Infantry Division \u2013 General Jan Henryk D\u0105browski * 18th Infantry Division \u2013 General Ludwik Kamieniecki, then Karol Kniaziewicz * Cavalry Division \u2013 General Michal Ignacy Kamie\u0144ski ==1813== * 16th Infantry Division \u2013 General Nicolas Joseph Maison * 17th Infantry Division \u2013 General Jacques-Pierre-Louis Puthod * 19th Infantry Division \u2013 General Marie Joseph Rochembeau ==1815== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:75%;\" |+V Corps !Division !Brigade !Regiment |- | rowspan=\"4\" |15th Infantry Division: General de Rottembourg | rowspan=\"2\" |1st Brigade |39th Line Regiment |- |40th Line Regiment |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2nd Brigade |36th Line Regiment |- |103rd Line Regiment |- | rowspan=\"4\" |16th Infantry Division: General Joseph Albert | rowspan=\"2\" |1st Brigade |10th Light Regiment |- |32nd Line Regiment |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2nd Brigade |18th Line Regiment |- |57th Line Regiment |- |rowspan=\"4\" |17th Infantry Division: General Charles Grandjean | rowspan=\"2\" |1st Brigade |Line Regiment |- |Line Regiment |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2nd Brigade |Line Regiment |- |Line Regiment |- | rowspan=\"5\" |Light Cavalry Division: General Antoine Fran\u00e7ois Eug\u00e8ne Merlin | rowspan=\"2\" |1st Brigade | |- | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2nd Brigade | |- | |- |3rd Brigade |Mixed Cavalry (2-4 squadrons) |- |National Guard Division: General de Berckheim |Haut-Rhin/Bas- Rhin National Guard |6 battalions |- |} ==References== ==Sources== * * Town notes of Strasbourg * Letters of Napoleon Category:1805 establishments in France GAI05 Category:Duchy of Warsaw Category:Military history of Poland Category:Military units and formations established in 1805 ",
