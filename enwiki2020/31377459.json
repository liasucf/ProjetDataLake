He has had several plays produced at the National Theatre and at Birmingham Rep. Stafford's adaptation of Michael Morpurgo's novel War Horse was first produced in London in 2007, where it is still running; other productions have been staged on Broadway, and in Toronto, Canada. Five of his plays have been published by Faber and Faber.
