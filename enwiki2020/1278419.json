It was part of Province of Greater Poland, and its capital was in \u0141\u0119czyca. The voivodeship had the area of 4,080 square kilometers, divided into three counties. Local sejmiks took place at \u0141\u0119czyca. The city of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, which until the 19th century was a small town, for centuries belonged to \u0141\u0119czyca Voivodeship. The voivodeship was created by King Wladyslaw Lokietek, out of the territory of Duchy of \u0141\u0119czyca, which had been established after the 1138 Testament of Boles\u0142aw III Krzywousty. It had five senators in the Senate of the Kingdom of Poland (since 1569 the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth). These were: Voivode of \u0141\u0119czyca, Castellan of \u0141\u0119czyca, Castellan of Brzeziny, Castellan of Inowlodz, and Castellan of Konary. At the sejmiks, local nobility elected four deputies to the Sejm of Poland, and two deputies to the Greater Poland Tribunal at Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski. Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland gives a detailed description of \u0141\u0119czyca Voivodeship: \"Following the testament of Boleslaw Krzywousty, the Land of \u0141\u0119czyca was a separate duchy, ruled by princes of the Piast dynasty (...) King Wladyslaw Lokietek reunited the duchy with Poland, making it a separate voivodeship. Local residents were used to their own legal system, so King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o decided to keep a separate official there. In 1418, the szlachta of \u0141\u0119czyca established its own rules, the 27 Articles of Constitutiones Terrae Lanciciensis generales (...) The voivodeship had the area of 80 square miles, stretching from Klodawa in the north, to the Pilica river in the south, where it bordered Sandomierz Voivodeship. In the 16th century, it had 74 Roman-Catholic parishes, 25 towns and 875 villages. It was the second most densely populated voivodeship of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, behind Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski Voivodeship (...) \u0141\u0119czyca Voivodeship had five senators: the Voivode of \u0141\u0119czyca, the Castellan of \u0141\u0119czyca, and the Castellans of Brzeziny, Inowlodz, and Konary (...) Of the three counties, the largest one was \u0141\u0119czyca County, which covered more than half of the area of the voivodeship. Local sejmiks took place at \u0141\u0119czyca, where four deputies were elected to the Sejm, and additional two to the Greater Poland Tribunal at Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski. Main starostas resided at \u0141\u0119czyca, Inowlodz, Zgierz and Klodawa\".
