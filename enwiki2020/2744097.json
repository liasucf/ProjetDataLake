    "text": "James Brown, OBE, DL (16 December 1862 \u2013 21 March 1939) was a Scottish Labour politician. James brown was born in the Whitletts area of Ayr but lived most of his life in Annbank where he went to school. He had started working in pits from the age of 12 and he later would become Secretary of the Ayrshire Miners' Union and of the Scottish Miners' National Union. He unsuccessfully contested North Ayrshire in January 1910 and was the Member of Parliament (MP) for South Ayrshire from 1918\u20131931 and from 1935 until his death in 1939. He was awarded the OBE in 1917, appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1930. He was Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1924, 1930 and 1931, and he also taught in the local sunday school in Annbank. He was a member of the Scottish National War Memorial committee formed in 1918 by the then Secretary of State for Scotland, the Liberal Party MP Robert Munro, which was tasked with forming a permanent memorial for World War I at Edinburgh Castle. In 1927 he criticised the decision to include Walter Thomas Monnington's painting Parliamentary Union of England and Scotland, 1707 in the Palace of Westminster which he said in a debate should \"get rid of this disgraceful picture and put something in its place which would be more true to history than it is.\" His Labour Party colleague, Dundee MP Tom Johnston further described the outrage at the inclusion of the painting by saying \"the only historical painting in St Stephen's Hall representing an incident in Scottish history deals with an act of national humiliation.\" In his authorised biography Bill Shankly said that Brown won the election in South Ayrshire as the local voters \"wouldn't vote Conservative\" but that he was \"too mild\" and not a \"keen socialist\" for some of the more militant Labour members. He was granted the Freedom of the Royal Burgh of Ayr in 1930, and of Girvan in 1931 and was awarded an Honorary LLD by the University of Glasgow in 1931. He was a Deputy Lieutenant of Ayrshire. His life story \"From Pit To Palace\" by Alexander Gammie was published in 1931. He was the great-great uncle of the future first Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament David Steel. ==References== == External links == * Category:1862 births Category:1939 deaths Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Ayrshire Category:Scottish Labour Party MPs Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Miners' Federation of Great Britain-sponsored MPs Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:UK MPs 1918\u20131922 Category:UK MPs 1922\u20131923 Category:UK MPs 1923\u20131924 Category:UK MPs 1924\u20131929 Category:UK MPs 1929\u20131931 Category:UK MPs 1935\u20131945 Category:Scottish miners Category:Lords High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland Category:People from South Ayrshire ",
