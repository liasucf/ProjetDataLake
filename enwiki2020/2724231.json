The center-right coalition of Thorbj\u00f6rn F\u00e4lldin had earlier suffered a loss upon the breakup of the government in 1981, the year before the election, when the rightist Moderate Party chose to withdraw from the government, protesting against the centrist tax policies of the F\u00e4lldin government. After regaining power, socialist leader Olof Palme succeeded in being elected Prime Minister again, having earlier held power between 1969 and 1976. The 2,533,250 votes for the Social Democrats is, in spite of a larger electorate, as of 2018 the highest number of people voting for a single party in Swedish electoral history, although the party had previously recorded higher percentage shares. ==Results== There were 5,594,594 valid ballots cast. {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right |- |colspan=7|300px |- !Party !Votes !% !Seats !+/\u2013 |- |align=left|Swedish Social Democratic Party||2,533,250||45.6||166||+12 |- |align=left|Moderate Party||1,313,337||23.6||86||+13 |- |align=left|Centre Party||859,618||15.5||56||\u22128 |- |align=left|People's Party||327,770||5.9||21||\u221217 |- |align=left|Left Party Communists||308,899||5.6||20||0 |- |align=left|Christian Democratic Unity||103,820||1.9||0||0 |- |align=left|Green Party||91,787||1.7||0||New |- |align=left|Workers Party Communists||5,745||0.1||0||0 |- |align=left|Other parties||10,376||0.2||0||0 |- |align=left|Invalid/blank votes||52,001||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013 |- |align=left|Total||5,606,603||100||349||0 |- |align=left|Registered voters/turnout||6,130,993||91.4||\u2013||\u2013 |- |align=left colspan=5|Source: Nohlen & St\u00f6ver |} ===By municipality=== Image:Sweden.1982.coalition.largest.map.svg|Votes by municipality.
