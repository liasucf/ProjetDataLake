    "text": "Agnes Waters (born Agnes Murphy Mulligan on July 1, 1893; died sometime after 1960) was a real estate person and member of the Mothers' movement who has been called \"the most inflammatory lecturer on the Mothers' circuit in the 1930s and 1940s.\" Although she had initially deemed herself \"liberal\", and worked with National Woman's Party for women's suffrage, she is better known for her later strongly antisemitic and white nationalist positions. She embraced the antisemitic forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and claimed mainline Christianity was \"controlled by Jews and blacks.\" She also stated a hostility to what she termed \"the invasion of the Asiatic races\" and felt the Chinese should stay in China. She ran for President in 1948.WOMAN IN PRESIDENT RACE; Agnes Waters Winds Up Her Campaign in Philadelphia, The New York Times of Nov. 3, 1948 == References == Category:American real estate businesspeople Category:American suffragists Category:American white nationalists Category:Antisemitism in the United States Category:Female candidates for President of the United States Category:1893 births Category:Date of death missing ",
