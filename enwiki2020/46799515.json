He is most well known for winning the second season of Megaszt\u00e1r. ==Personal life== Caramel was born on 1 February 1982 in the town of Szolnok. He is of Hungarian Roma descent. At age 16, he moved to T\u00f6r\u00f6kszentmikl\u00f3s with his stepfather, mother and siblings. His parents' relationship deteriorated after his brother was killed in a car crash, leading him to move out at age 17. Work was hard to find because of his herniated disc. He got his nickname Caramel from a friend when he received a negative response from a publisher. ==Musician== In 2004, he applied to Megaszt\u00e1r. In 2005, Caramel narrowly won over fellow contestant Tam\u00e1s Palcs\u00f3 to become the first contest's winner. He started to compile his first album in his apartment. In 2005, he released two albums: a compilation of the songs he sang at Megaszt\u00e1r, the second one being called Nyugalomter\u00e1pia. Both reached number one at the JAHASZ charts. In December of that year, he held his first release concert with other artists, such as Istv\u00e1n Lerch, Eszter Szab\u00f3, Joci P\u00e1pai, and Eszter Bart\u00f3k. In 2006, he released his next album, \u00dajrahangolva, with music videos filmed in London. More albums followed in 2010, 2011 and 2014. He took part in multiple music shows as judges, including the Hungarian version of The Voice, and Az \u00e9nek iskol\u00e1ja, a school-inspired music competition show. In 2011, Caramel was selected as a contestant for A Dal 2012, the first edition for the national selection of Hungary in the Eurovision Song Contest, with the song \"V\u00edzi\u00f3\". It was one of the top 4 by televoting, but lost to Compact Disco. He was a judge for the only season of The Voice \u2013 Magyarorsz\u00e1g hangja. He was a judge in A Dal 2017 and was also a jury member for Hungary for the Eurovision Song Contest 2017. ==References== Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Hungarian male singers Category:Hungarian Romani people Category:People from Szolnok Category:21st-century Hungarian singers Category:21st-century male singers ",
