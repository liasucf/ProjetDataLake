At first, Flatman denied any claims that he is gay. However, when a new Avenger recruit called Living Lightning first approached the Great Lakes Avengers (usually abbreviated as GLA), he thought they were actually the Gay/Lesbian Alliance. After apologizing, he left quickly, but his willingness to come out to others gave Flatman the courage to do it himself.GLA: Misassembled #2 He revealed that he is in fact gay to his teammates, though he felt one-upped by Mr. Immortal being dubbed the pinnacle of human evolution (using the ambiguous phrase \"Homo Supreme\"). Over time, Flatman's doctoral degree began to come into question. He is not able to present a degree to prove his education and when asked by Doorman what he was a doctor of, he replies that he is a doctor of \"stuff\". When told by a fellow doctor (who had confused him for Mr. Fantastic) that time moved in only a single direction, Flatman asked which direction that was.GLA: Misassembled #3 ===GLA: Misassembled=== During the G.L.A. mini- series, the team took on Maelstrom who was trying to destroy the universe.

Soon after, they hear an alarm on a nearby factory and encounter the Grasshopper, who was battling Batroc the Leaper and his lackeys. During the battle, Flatman offers Grasshopper membership in the team and he accepts. Seconds later, Zaran, one of Batroc's minions, kills him. Refusing to let the deaths of Dinah Soar and Grasshopper get him down, Flatman continued to try to persuade the team to further research Maelstrom's plans for universal destruction. However, it was not until Mr. Immortal regained his sanity that the team rallied together to defeat Maelstrom. During the final battle, Big Bertha tried to save Flatman, who was seemingly sucked into a vortex created from Maelstrom's device. However, it turned out that only his clothes had been sucked off and he was merely standing at an extreme angle so he wouldn't be seen naked. With the GLA possessing a stronger resolve than ever, they returned to their headquarters only for Flatman to find that Tony Stark had sent a cease and desist notice ordering them to stop using the Avengers name. After discovering that they were all mutants, the team changed their name to the Great Lakes X-Men, complete with new costumes.GLA: Misassembled #1\u20134 (2005) ===GLX-Mas Special=== During the GLX-Mas Special, the team confronted Dr. Tannenbaum, who had released an army of living Christmas trees on the citizens of Wisconsin.GLX-Mas Special #1 ===Great Lakes Champions=== The team was invited to the annual Superheroes Poker Tournament.

The two came to blows over Deadpool's financial misadventures, and Flatman unveiled 'Origami Fu', but was defeated when he became a boat at Deadpool's urgings.
