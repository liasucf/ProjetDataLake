The novel tells the story of the fictional Old Hollywood star Evelyn Hugo, who at the age of 79 decides to give a final interview to an unknown journalist, Monique Grant. According to Reid, Evelyn Hugo was loosely based in part on actresses Elizabeth Taylor, who was married eight times to seven different men, and Ava Gardner, who revealed the secrets of her life to a journalist which was eventually published as Ava Gardner: The Secret Conversations. Reid also discusses how Rita Hayworth was a big influence on the character Evelyn Hugo. Hayworth, a Spanish woman, had a very similar start to Hugo which can be seen in the beginning of the novel.

Jennifer Beals and Ilene Chaiken, who worked on The L Word, will be producing the show.

Dealing with her professional career going nowhere and her husband leaving her, Monique is at an all time low. Having worked for the prestigious Vivant for less than a year, she had not yet been given many opportunities, thus stalling her writing career. One day, she learns some life-changing news from her editor: actress Evelyn Hugo, a famous actress from the 1960s, has agreed to an interview with Vivant under the condition that Monique is the one to do the interview. Though she is stunned by the request, Monique realizes the opportunity could make her career, that is if she doesn't allow herself to be star struck by one of the most famous actresses in the world. Evelyn Hugo takes Monique on a tempestuous ride as she uncovers the truth of her glamorous life and career. These truths form a connection between Monique and Evelyn until too many truths lead their lives to intersect in a tragic way. == Publication and influences == Pre-release Reid garnered excitement for the novel by releasing the book cover and an excerpt of the book with Entertainment Weekly on December 6, 2016.
