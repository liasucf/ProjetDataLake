    "text": "Walter Alfredo Novellino (born 4 June 1953; ), is an Italian football manager and former player, who played as a midfielder. ==Club career== Novellino was born at Montemarano, province of Avellino. After spending his childhood in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, he later returned to Italy, and started his professional career with Torino, then obtaining his major successes with Perugia and A.C. Milan, and being nicknamed Monzon (after an Argentine boxer) due to both his physical resemblance to him and his determination on the pitch. Novellino announced his retirement in 1987. In his first season with Milan, he helped the club to their tenth Serie A title in 1979. When the club was relegated following their involvement in the Totonero 1980 match-fixing scandal, he remained with the team and helped Milan win the Serie B title and immediately obtain promotion back to Serie A; during the 1980\u201381 Serie B season, he notably scored the goal against Monza which secured promotion for the club. ==International career== Novellino won one cap for the Italy national football team in 1978. ==Style of play== A talented yet tenacious and hard-working midfielder, Novellino was known for excellent technical ability, offensive capabilities, fighting spirit, and dribbling skills. Although he was usually played as an attacking midfielder, he was also capable of playing as a winger, as a second striker, or as a forward. ==Managerial career== Novellino made his debut in management in 1992 with Perugia of Serie C1, but this was short-lived. Next season, he moved to Gualdo whom he led in two years to win first Serie C2 and then to a spot in the Serie C1 promotion play-off finals which they eventually lost to Avellino. He then went on to Serie B sides Perugia, Ravenna and then in Venezia whom he led to Serie A for the first time in the club history. In 2000, he led Napoli to a Serie A promotion, and repeated the feat the following season with Piacenza. In 2002, he joined Sampdoria, immediately leading the team to a Serie A promotion, the fourth time he'd helped a team achieve this goal. In his first Serie A season with Sampdoria, they achieved a 5th place and a UEFA Cup qualification, but lost the battle with Udinese for the last UEFA Champions League place. He left Sampdoria in 2007 to join Torino, where he was fired on 16 April 2008 following disappointing results that left the team in the relegation zone; he was replaced by Gianni De Biasi who ultimately managed to save the granata from relegation. On 8 December, only a few months after his dismissal, he was called back to Torino following the sacking of De Biasi, taking over the team in 18th place and 12 only points achieved in 15 games. He was fired once again on 24 March 2009, after a sequence of negative results that left Torino in deep relegation zone, being replaced by Giancarlo Camolese. In July 2009 he was appointed new head coach of Reggina, with the aim to lead the Calabrians promptly back to the top flight. However, he managed to achieve only nine points in ten games, being ultimately dismissed on 24 October following a 0\u20132 loss to his former club Torino. On 14 February 2011 he was unveiled as new head coach of Serie B club Livorno, replacing Giuseppe Pillon at the helm of the Amaranto, until 21 December 2011 when he rescinds the contract by mutual agreement with the company. On 10 March 2016 he was appointed Palermo manager.http://www.football-italia.net/81069/official-palermo-appoint- novellino He was sacked on 11 April 2016.http://www.football- italia.net/82665/novellino-%E2%80%98palermo-have-sacked-me%E2%80%99 On 29 November 2016 he was called in by struggling Serie B side Avellino to replace outcoming manager Domenico Toscano. He was dismissed by Avellino on 3 April 2018. ==Style of management== Novellino favours a 4\u20134\u20132 formation which makes use of a zonal marking defensive system, a deep-lying playmaker in midfield, and a physical centre-forward fielded alongside a more mobile and talented second striker. ==Managerial statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align: center\" |+ Managerial record by team and tenure |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Team !rowspan=\"2\"|Nat !rowspan=\"2\"|From !rowspan=\"2\"|To !colspan=\"8\"|Record |- ! ! ! ! ! |- | align=\"left\"|Perugia | |align=left|3 December 1992 |align=left|23 June 1993 |- | align=\"left\" |Gualdo | |align=left|23 June 1993 |align=left|1 July 1995 |- | align=\"left\" |Perugia | |align=left|1 July 1995 |align=left|26 September 1995 |- | align=\"left\" |Ravenna | |align=left|2 June 1996 |align=left|18 June 1997 |- | align=\"left\" |Unione Venezia | |align=left|18 June 1997 |align=left|15 June 1999 |- | align=\"left\" |Napoli | |align=left|15 June 1999 |align=left|13 June 2000 |- | align=\"left\" |Piacenza | |align=left|13 June 2000 |align=left|4 June 2002 |- | align=\"left\" |Sampdoria | |align=left|4 June 2002 |align=left|31 May 2007 |- | align=\"left\" |Torino | |align=left|6 June 2007 |align=left|15 April 2008 |- | align=\"left\" |Torino | |align=left|8 December 2008 |align=left|24 March 2009 |- | align=\"left\" |Reggina Calcio | |align=left|11 June 2009 |align=left|24 October 2009 |- | align=\"left\" |Livorno | |align=left|14 February 2011 |align=left|21 December 2011 |- | align=\"left\" |Modena | |align=left|20 March 2013 |align=left|28 February 2015 |- | align=\"left\" |Palermo | |align=left|10 March 2016 |align=left|12 April 2016 |- | align=\"left\" | Avellino | |align=left|28 November 2016 |align=left|4 April 2018 |- | align=\"left\" \"| Catania | |align=left|27 February 2019 |align=left|6 May 2019 |- | colspan=4 | Career total |} ==Honours== ===Player=== ;Milan *Serie A (1): 1978\u201379 *Serie B (1): 1980\u201381 *Mitropa Cup (1): 1981\u201382 ;Perugia *Coppa Piano Karl Rappan (1): 1978 ===Manager=== ;Gualdo *Serie C2 (1): 1993\u201394 (girone B) ===Individual=== *A.C.
