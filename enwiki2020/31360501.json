Introduced to western cultivation in 1908, B. officinalis was accorded the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Merit three years later,Hillier & Sons. (1977). Hilliers' Manual of Trees and Shrubs, 4th Edition. David & Charles, Newton Abbot, England. and the Award of Garden Merit (record 689) in 2002. ==Description== Buddleja officinalis largely resembles the commoner B. davidii in shape and size, growing to less than 2.5 m in height. The inflorescences are honey-scented mauve panicles, shorter (under 8 cm) than those of davidii, and more conical. The leaves are lanceolate, under 15 cm long, softly pubescent, the upper surface rich green in colour, the underside grey. 2n = 38.Chen, G, Sun, W-B, & Sun, H. (2007). Ploidy variation in Buddleja L.

The Linnean Society of London. ==Cultivation== Buddleja officinalis is not fully frost hardy, unable to survive temperatures lower than \u221210\u00b0 C, and is best grown against a south-facing wall. The shrub should be cut back hard each year immediately after flowering in spring. Propagation by softwood cuttings is easily accomplished, using vermiculite as a rooting medium. In the UK the shrub is often grown as a nectar source for vanessid butterflies such as the peacock on emergence from hibernation.Brookes, A. H. (2007). Winter flowering buddlejas.
