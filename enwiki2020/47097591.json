For the new potpourri of comedy, farce and drama, which opened yesterday at the Paramount Theatre, is a singularly shapeless and unrewarding entertainment. Not being acquainted with the play, we wouldn't know whether Leonard Spigelgass, the scenarist, tampered to any great extent with the original. But (and this is the only thing that matters right now) it is quite evident that Mr. Spigelgass certainly didn't contribute any improvements. He wrote an abundance of dialogue, to be sure, but most of it is witless.\" == References == == External links == * Category:1947 films Category:1947 comedy films Category:American films Category:American comedy films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:American films based on plays Category:Films directed by Lewis Allen Category:Films produced by Hal B.
