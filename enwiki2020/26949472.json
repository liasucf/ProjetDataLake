    "text": "Israel Peace Week is an annual event on college campuses worldwide aimed at presenting Israel as \"a democratic, peace-seeking nation attempting to coexist with neighbors.\" It is scheduled each year for the week after Israeli Apartheid Week as a pro-Israel response. The international event is organized independently by student groups at every campus it operates on. 2010 was the first year of the event, and it reached 31 campuses in the United States and Australia. It later expanded to additional universities and English-speaking countries. ==References== * * * * * * ==External links== * Israel Peace Week on Facebook Category:Zionism in the United States ",
