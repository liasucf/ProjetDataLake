After school at Marseille, he studied in Paris at the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand.\"Brunetiere, Ferdinand\", The Catholic Encyclopedia and Its Makers, New York, the Encyclopedia Press, 1917, p. 21 Desiring a teaching career, he entered for examination at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, but failed, and the outbreak of war in 1870 prevented him trying again. He turned to private tuition and literary criticism. After the publication of successful articles in the Revue Bleue, he became connected with the Revue des Deux Mondes, first as contributor, then as secretary and sub-editor, and finally, in 1893, as principal editor. ===Career=== In 1886 Bruneti\u00e8re was appointed professor of French language and literature at the \u00c9cole Normale, a singular honour for one who had not passed through the academic mill; and later he presided with distinction over various conferences at the Sorbonne and elsewhere. He was decorated with the Legion of Honour in 1887, and became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1893. The published works of Bruneti\u00e8re consist largely of reprinted papers and lectures. They include six series of Etudes critiques (1880-1898) on French history and literature; Le Roman naturaliste (1883); Histoire et Litt\u00e9rature, three series (1884-1886); Questions de critique (1888; second series, 1890). The first volume of L'Evolution de genres dans l'histoire de la litt\u00e9rature, lectures in which a formal classification, founded on Darwinism, is applied to the phenomena of literature, appeared in 1890; and his later works include a series of studies (2 vols, 1894) on the evolution of French lyrical poetry during the 10th century, a history of French classic literature begun in 1904, a monograph on Honor\u00e9 de Balzac (1906), and various pamphlets of a polemical nature dealing with questions of education, science and religion. Among these may be mentioned Discours acad\u00e9miques (1901), Discours de combat (1900, 1903), L'Action sociale du Christianisme (1904), Sur les chemins de la croyance (1905). ===Political activity=== Bruneti\u00e8re was a leading member of the anti- Dreyfusards.Blake Smith, The Religion of Liberal Democracy, Tablet Magazine, November 15, 2019 https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/arts- letters/articles/the-religion-of-liberal-democracy ===Religious views=== Before 1895 Bruneti\u00e8re was widely known as a rationalist, freethinking scholar. That year, however, he published an article, \"Apr\u00e8s une visite au Vatican,\" in which he argued that science was incapable of providing a convincing social morality and that faith alone could achieve that result.Jennifer Michael Hecht. The End of the Soul: Scientific Modernity, Atheism and Anthropology in France, New York: Columbia University Press, 2003, pp. 172-176\\. Shortly afterwards, he converted to Roman Catholicism. As a Catholic, Bruneti\u00e8re was orthodox and his political sympathies were conservative. He authored the article on \"Literary and Theological Appreciation of Bousset\" for the Catholic Encyclopedia. ==Works== * \u00c9tudes Critiques sur l\u2019Histoire de la Litt\u00e9rature Fran\u00e7aise (8 vols., 1880\u20131907). * Le Roman Naturaliste (1883). * Histoire et Litt\u00e9rature (3 vols., 1884). * Questions de Critique (1888). * Nouvelles Questions de Critique (1890). * \u00c9volution de la Critique (1890). * \u00c9volution des Genres dans l\u2019Histoire de la Litt\u00e9rature (2 vols., 1890). * Epoques du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais (2 vols., 1891\u20131892). * Histoire de la Litt\u00e9rature Fran\u00e7aise Classique (4 vols., 1891\u20131892). * Essais sur la Litt\u00e9rature Contemporaine (1892). * \u00c9volution de la Po\u00e9sie Lyrique en France au dix-neuvi\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle (2 vols., 1892\u20131894). * La Science et la Religion (1895). * Nouveaux Essais sur la Litt\u00e9rature Contemporaine (1895). * Bases de la Croyance (1896). * La Renaissance de l'Id\u00e9alisme (1896). * Manuel de l\u2019Histoire de la Litt\u00e9rature Fran\u00e7aise (1898). * Discours Acad\u00e9miques (1901). * Les Raisons Actuelles de Croire (1901). * Victor Hugo (2 vols., 1902). * Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s Litt\u00e9raires (1904). * Cinq Lettres sur Ernest Renan (1904). * Sur les Chemins de la Croyance (1904). * Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, 1799\u20131850 (1906). * Discours de Combat (3 vols., 1900\u20131907). * Lettres de Combat (posthumous, 1912).
