The team shirt features a diagonal stripe (traditionally blue on white on the home kit, and a combination of different colors on the away kits) that crosses the chest diagonally from right to left, which is considered a distinctive element of its identity. Since 1904, the city of Puebla had an official football team. It started as club Puebla AC, founded by Englishmen. It was later incorporated into the Mexican football league during the amateur era. In the 1944\u201345 season, they won their first official tournament, the Copa Mexico (nowadays known as Copa MX). They won that trophy again in the 1953\u201354 season. Their first league title came in the 1982\u201383 season after defeating Guadalajara on penalty kicks. The team won a third Copa Mexico on the 1987\u201388 season, and in the 1989\u201390 season, they won both their fourth Copa Mexico and their second league title after beating Universidad de Guadalajara. This feat (winning both the league and the Copa Mexico championships) earned the team the right to be counted among the \"Campeon\u00edsimos\". In 1991, they defeated Police from Trinidad and Tobago for their first CONCACAF championship. In the 1992\u20131993 season, the team ended as runner up, as they lost the league title final 2\u20130 against Leon in overtime. The team was relegated to Primera A (the second tier league of Mexico) at the end of the 1999 season, but the club owners bought the franchise of the promoted team (this practice was later banned by the league). The team was relegated again at the end of the Clausura 2005 season. The team won the Primera A Apertura 2006 tournament beating Salamanca in the final; in the following tournament, Clausura 2007, they were knocked out in the semi- finals by Leon. Having won one of the tournaments of the yearly cycle, they earned the right to compete for the promotion against the winners of the other tournament. On May 26, 2007, Puebla was promoted again by defeating Dorados de Sinaloa in the promotion game, in an overcrowded Cuauht\u00e9moc Stadium with more than 45,000 fans. Celebrations all around the city of Puebla ensued, remembering the celebrations in 1983 and 1990 when the team won the league championship. Puebla spent the following years eluding relegation in the top tier league, but in the Clausura 2009 season, against the odds, they managed their way to the tournament knockout stage, reaching the semi-finals, where they were eliminated by the eventual champion, Pumas UNAM. ==History== ===Early years=== Puebla has competed since 1904, when an English Athletic club Puebla AC joined the Liga Mexicana de Football Amateur Association.

In that position, the coach Ra\u00fal C\u00e1rdenas did not ask for any players from the draft and brought five players from Yugoslavia which were a disappointment. This tournament was the worst in the club's history, with only 9 points in 2 victories, 3 draws, and 12 losses, with 13 goals in favor and 41 against.

Alfredo Tena took over as coach and brought some reinforcements as Mart\u00edn Ubaldi, Fran\u00e7ois Omam Biyik, Rub\u00e9n Ruiz D\u00edaz, and Miguel Pardeza. Puebla did not improve, and Tena was replaced by Jos\u00e9 Mari Bakero as coach.

Then Valente Aguirre said that there was no way Leon was moving out of Guanajuato. In response, Francisco Bernat said, \"If we bought the club was to move it to Puebla, we're from Puebla and it's our duty to our fans to have a club in first division... now, if they want the club to remain in Leon, they'll have to pay us the 9 millions that we paid\". That situation gave way to an uproar from the supporters of Leon who did not want their club disappearing. On June 23, it was announced that Puebla would remain in first division, also that Leon would remain in Leon by purchasing Uni\u00f3n de Curtidores, the other team based in Leon. Only the players changed teams. Puebla took the players from Leon, and Leon took the players from Curtidores. The club that was relegated would become BUAP. ===21st century=== Puebla obtained only 20 points in the Winter 1999 tournament, and Jos\u00e9 Mari Bakero was replaced by Mario Carrillo as coach. In the summer of 2000, Miguel Mejia Bar\u00f3n took over as head coach, and the club qualified for quarter-finals, after beating Atlas 5\u20131, where they lost 9\u20130 on aggregate to Toluca.

After drawing the first match 1\u20131, Puebla won the second leg, in Oaxaca, 1\u20130, giving them the 2005 Primera A title. Jorge Aravena resigned as head coach, and was succeeded by Paul Moreno. At the start of the Clausura 2006, once again Puebla fell victim to poor administration errors. First, they let go of Eudalio Arriaga and brought Leandro Alvez and Carlos Mar\u00eda Morales. Second, they changed coaches, provoking the club to fall into last place with 14 points. When they played the promotion match, they brought in as head coach C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti, who took the club to Argentina for a short pre-season action and later they named C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti as coach. With all this going on, when the day came to face Quer\u00e9taro, the club was not at 100% and fell in the first match 1\u20132 in the Estadio Cuauht\u00e9moc and 3\u20130 in the Estadio La Corregidora. At the start of the 2006 Apertura, once again they had built a plan in order for the club's promotion to the first division. The owners started off first by naming Jos\u00e9 Luis S\u00e1nchez Sol\u00e1, who was not known and by some was not accepted and criticized harshly. Jos\u00e9 Luis S\u00e1nchez Sol\u00e1 had previously worked with the club's inferior division, with players such as Juan Carlos Garc\u00eda, Sergio Rosas, Sergio P\u00e9rez, Rodrigo Salinas, Luis Miguel Noriega and the goalkeeper Jorge Villalpando, who he brought up to the first team and were crucial players that year. He also brought in veteran player \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez, who went on to win to scoring titles in 2006 and 2007. He also brought in the unknown at the time, an amateur player Jorge Dami\u00e1n \"El Ruso\" Zamogilny who quickly became a fan favorite. In the 3rd round2006 primera A champion of the tournament, the club defeated Tampico Madero 2\u20130, and snapped a 15-match winless streak. The club qualified to the play-offs after finishing first in the first group, with 33 points. In the play-off, they faced Coatzacoalcos, beating them 5\u20133. In semi-finals, they faced Cruz Azul Hidalgo, which they ended up drawing a 2\u20132 tie, which Puebla would advance for better position in the tournament. In the finale Puebla faced Salamanca who was the leader in the tournament that year. The first match was a 1\u20131 draw, played in the Estadio Cuauht\u00e9moc, with a little over 40,000 Puebla supporters. In the second game, the clubs once again tied, now with a score of 2\u20132. That finale was decided in a penalty shoot out which Puebla won, after Jorge Zamogilny scored the fifth goal and Adri\u00e1n Dominguez missed Salamanca's fifth goal. In the Clasura 2007, the club had a better tournament than the previous, finishing 1st place in group one, with 36 points and once again \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez winning the goal scoring title with 15. In quarter-finals they would face Pumas Morelos, winning that series with a score of 4\u20133. They advanced and faced Club Le\u00f3n in semi-finals. The first match was played in the Nou Camp in Le\u00f3n, with a score of 2\u20130, with Leon taking home advantage. The second match was played in Puebla in the Estadio Cuauht\u00e9moc, with over 45,000 Puebla supporters. That game ended in a 3\u20133, in a match that is still talked about today, and that some speculate has started a riverbed between these 2 clubs. Puebla waited for the champion of the Clausura 2007 that would be disputed by Club Le\u00f3n and Dorados de Sinaloa. Dorados would be that champion 4\u20135, and so faced Puebla in a promotional match to determine the club that would be promoted to the first division. The first match was played in the Estadio Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez in Sinaloa. The game would finish in a 1\u20131 draw. Scoring for Puebla was the lead scoring champion \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez, and Carlos Casartelli for Dorados. The second game was played on Sunday May 26, 2007, in a packed Estadio Cuauht\u00e9moc, with over fans, which the club later would be cited for being over- capacity.2007 promotion final Puebla defeated Dorados with a score of 3\u20132, \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez scored 2 goals in the '8, and in the '45 Hugo Ruiz scored the second in the '26. Scoring for the Dorados were Mario Padilla and Lucas Silva. The promotion had finally come, after 2 years of first division absence. Players who took part of this achievement in 2007 were: Orlando Rinc\u00f3n, Sergio P\u00e9rez, Luis Miguel Noriega, Sergio Rosas, Jorge Villalpando, \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez, Jorge Dami\u00e1n el ruso Zamogilny and the captain Joaqu\u00edn Vel\u00e1zquez. In the 2007 Apertura tournament, the club hosted club America in the first round, after 2 years of absence. The club finished with 17-point by means of 4 wins, 5 draws and lost 8. The squad was mostly formed with players who obtain the promotion and was poorly reinforce with poor reinforcement such as players Mateo Figoli and Juan Quiroga. The starting line up: were Lupe \"La Pantera Rosa\", Walter V\u00edlchez, \"El Ruso\" Zalmogilny, Quiroga, Adrian S\u00e1nchez, \"El Bola\", Vel\u00e1zquez, Noriega, Hugo Ru\u00edz, Orlando Rinc\u00f3n, Mateo Figoli. At the end off the Apertura 2007, Puebla FC was once again involved in scandal. Then a Mexican newspaper company stated that the club had been sold to a Brazilian businessman, Aurelio Almeida, owner of the Brazilian club Real Brazil. A day after this came to surface, owner Francisco Bernat held a conference where he stated that the club had not being sold, claiming that his signature had been forged. After weeks of speculations, it was on November 21 when it was decided that the contract and signatures were not valid. In the 2008 Clausura, the club made a complete reconstruction, with 12 new players including: Gilberto Mora, Melvin Brown, Felipe Ayala, Javier C\u00e1mpora and Nicolas Olivera. It would seem that the club would not have any problem avoiding relegation, but at mid- tournament, the club had fallen to the bottom. So, manager Jos\u00e9 Luis S\u00e1nchez Sol\u00e0 \"El Chelis\" was fired. This stirred up problems with the fans and the players, leading to the board of directors reversing the decision. With the manager back in the club, they beat their direct opponent in relegation, Tiburones Rojos in Veracruz. In the 16th round the club officially avoided regulation after Veracruz had lost to Pumas UNAM. In the last game played in Puebla, the club faced Atlante and drew 2\u20132, which kept them out of the play- off that year. In the 2008 Apertura the club managed 15 points by means of 2 wins, 9 draws and 6 losses. Mario Carrillo took over as coach after Jos\u00e9 Luis S\u00e1nchez Sol\u00e1 was let go. In mid tournament Mario Carrillo separated long time club players \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez and Joaqu\u00edn Vel\u00e1zquez from the club, with the excuse of not attending a psychic reading by his personal psychic Mama Tona. At the end of the tournament, both players were released, and weeks later, Mario Carrillo was replaced once again by Jos\u00e9 Luis S\u00e1nchez Sol\u00e1. In the Clausura 2009, Puebla started out the off season by signing veteran players Daniel Osorno and Duilio Davino along with foreign players Ram\u00f3n N\u00fa\u00f1ez and Alejandro Acosta. The club started off the season by first falling 4\u20130 to Monterrey, in Monterrey, which concerned the fans and the owners. However, the players quickly adapted to their new teammates and went on to lose only one match in their next 10 matches. They finished the tournament with 26 points by means of 7 wins 6 draws and 6 losses. The club qualified to the quarterfinals for the first time since 2001 and faced Monterrey in their first match. Having Monterrey beat 4\u20130 in the first game of the tournament, no one gave Puebla a chance, but in the first match, Puebla surprised everyone by winning 3\u20131 goals by Gerardo Galindo 4' (own goal), Alejandro Acosta in the 6' and Sergio P\u00e9rez in the 56', Humberto Suazo scored Monterrey's only goal in the 48'. In the second game held in the Estadio Tecnol\u00f3gico in Monterrey, the clubs drew a 2\u20132 draw, with a final score of 5\u20133 advancing Puebla to face Pumas in The semi- finals. In the first game played in a jam-packed Estadio Cuauht\u00e9moc in Puebla, Puebla fell 2\u20131 in a last-minute goal scored by Marco Antonio Palacios. In the second game played in the Estadio Ol\u00edmpico Universitario, Puebla came out strong scoring the 2 goals that would advance them to the finals but in the minute 89' Dar\u00edo Ver\u00f3n scored for Pumas. The game ended in a 2\u20131 victory for Puebla, but the final score was a 3\u20133 draw, which advance Pumas to the finals where they would eventually defeat Pachuca. At the end of the tournament, having finished 5th overall along with Monterrey, both clubs qualified to the 2009 Copa Sudamericana. Shortly after the Mexican federation protest against the CONMEBOL, after clubs Guadalajara and San Luis were being discriminated and about to be disqualified from the Copa Libertadores after the Swine flew had broken out in Mexico, claiming they were a health hazard to the rest of the clubs, some clubs even refuse to play their games in Mexico. With this problem at hand the federation decide to pull out of all CONMEBOL tournament which were the Copa Libertadores, Copa Sudamericana and the Copa Am\u00e9rica which Mexico had been a part of since the early 1990s. After both sides came to an agreement Mexico decided to return to the competition but this time the CONCACAF decided not to allow Mexico to take part of the Copa Sudamericana claiming that the Mexicans clubs should focus more in the CONCACAF Champions League which was its own domestic tournament. In the Apertura 2009, the club began the tournament by signing players Jared Borgetti, Nicol\u00e1s Mart\u00ednez, Nicol\u00e1s Vigneri, Carlos \"El Pescadito\" Ru\u00edz and the return of Joaqu\u00edn Vel\u00e1zquez and Nicol\u00e1s Olivera, who had been on loan to Tiburones Rojos de Veracruz. The club quickly adapted with the new players and did not see a loss until the 10th round. It was a controversial game were Puebla lost against Monterrey due to bad calls and a disallowed goal that was proven to be legit. The club once again finished with 26 points, by means of 6 wins 9 draws and 4 losses, which qualified them to the quarter-finals. Cruz Azul was the opponent in that series, and the first match was held in Puebla, where the game ended in a 4\u20134 draw with Puebla scoring 4 goals in the first half. Cruz Azul scored 2 polemic goals which determined to be crucial in the outcome of the series. The second match was held in the Estadio Azul; the game ended in a 3\u20132 victory for Cruz Azul, where once again controversy occurred, when Cruz Azul scored its first goal that was a clear offside. Cruz Azul advanced and eventually made it to the final, which they lost to Monterrey. And so it came to an end, with Puebla having qualified to 2 consecutive playoffs, not since the 1991\u20131992 tournament. At the start of the 2010 year, Puebla along with Club Am\u00e9rica, Monterrey, Chiapas, Estudiantes Tecos, Club Santos Laguna, Tigres de la UANL and Atlante played the 2010 InterLiga. Puebla finished first in group B with 2 wins no draws and 1 loss, scored 6 goals and allowed 3 for a total of 6 points. The club qualified for the final in which they faced group A second place which was Estudiantes Tecos. That match took place on January 13, 2010 played in front of 27,000 in The Home Depot Center. Puebla's Alejandro Acosta scored the first goal in the fourth minute of play followed by Nicol\u00e1s Olivera goal in the 47'. In the second half Estudiantes Tecos scored 3 consecutive goals and so qualifying to the 2010 Copa Libertadores. In the Clausura 2010 the club started off the preseason by signing players Marcelo Palau, Herculez Gomez and Alexandro \u00c1lvarez also bringing back players \u00c1lvaro Fabi\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, Hiber Ru\u00edz and Marco Capetillo who had not played since 2007. The club started the tournament by losing 1\u20130 to Tigres de la UANL at home. The club won its sound game 3\u20132 against Estudiantes Tecos on the road. The club would not fair to good having the 2nd worst defense in the league but tied third for the best offense, finishing 13 overall with a record of 5 wins 4 draws losing 8, a scoring 28 goals allowing 31 for a total of 19 points. Herculez Gomez led the club as well as the league in goals scored with ten. That tally earned him the goal scoring title in a tie with Javier Hern\u00e1ndez. However, Herculez Gomez had scored his 10 goals in fewer minutes played than the other two, scoring 6 of his goals coming in as a substitute. A crisis came into the club with owner Ricardo Henaine, until he resigned, this caused the ninth spell of manager Jos\u00e9 Luis S\u00e1nchez Sol\u00e1 as puebla manager. ==Badge== Cuauhtemoc Stadium during a match.

It was on May 21, 1959 when Alvarez scored his last goals with Puebla before leaving the club to join Veracruz. Ricardo Alvarez left a record of 86 goals in 125 games through a career that spanned 5 years. Half a century later, the name of \"La Changa\" Alvarez is still the best goal scorer ever in the history of Puebla FC in first division. Even with the club's constancy in first division, playing a total of 54 championships, no other player has reached Alvarez's number of goals scored and only one player has obtained the league goal scoring title in 1996. It was the Spanish Carlos Mu\u00f1oz who gave Puebla FC their only one goal scoring title in 1996 with 15 goals. Thanks to 4 good tournaments, Carlos Mu\u00f1oz placed himself in the list of the best goal scorers in the club's history but still far from the 86 scored by Ricardo Alvarez. Two players were close to beat Alvarez's record: Silvio Fogel in The 1970s and Carlos Poblete in the 1980s. Silvio Fogel scored 84 goals and now is the scoring runner-up in Puebla's history. Carlos Poblete scored 83 and now is third place in the all- time scoring list. Carlos Poblete is at the top of the list in goals scored in playoffs with 15 goals scored. Carlos Poblete and Silvio scored over 100 goals each one, but this was done playing with different clubs. And Ricardo Alvarez did the same scoring 113 goals in his career playing for Puebla FC, Moctezuma, and Veracruz. {|-table style=\"width: 100%; text-align: left;\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"2\" |- | style=\"width:65%; vertical-align:top; text-align:center;\"| All time Goal Leaders {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:60%;\" |- style=\"background:#ddd; text-align:center; color:black;\" !width=\"5\"|Position !width=\"60\"|Player !width=\"5\"|Goals !width=\"70\"|Years |- align=center |*1 |Mexico Ricardo \u00c1lvarez |87 |1945\u201350 |- align=center |*2 |Argentina Silvio Fogel |84 |1975\u201383 |- align=center |*3 |Chile Carlos Poblete |83 |1986\u201396 |- align=center |*4 |Uruguay \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez |75 |2006\u201310 |- align=center |*5 |Chile Jorge Aravena |66 |1988\u201391 |- align=center |*6 |Mexico Guadalupe Vel\u00e1squez |61 |1943\u201349 |- align=center |*7 |Argentina Matias Alustiza |64 |2012-16 |- align=center |*8 |Brazil Muricy Ramalho |57 |1979\u201385 |- align=center |*9 |Mexico Paul Rene Moreno |45 |1982-89 |- align=center |*10 |Mexico Carlos Mu\u00f1oz |33 |1996\u201398 |} | style=\"width:35%; vertical-align:top; text-align:center;\"| Goal Scoring Champions {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\" |- style=\"background:#ddd; text-align:center; color:black;\" !
