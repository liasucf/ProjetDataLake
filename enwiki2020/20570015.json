    "text": "Michal Ha\u0161ek (born 17 April 1976) is a Czech politician and former Governor of South Moravian Region. From 2002 until 2014, Ha\u0161ek was a member of the Chamber of Deputies (MP). He also served as shadow Minister of Agriculture in the shadow cabinet of former Prime Minister Ji\u0159\u00ed Paroubek. ==Career== Ha\u0161ek is a graduate of the Faculty of Law of Masaryk University. He also has a juris degree, though it's validity has been called into question as it was obtained at an obscure law school in the southwestern Slovakian town of Sl\u00e1dkovi\u010dovo. Furthermore, his thesis was led by a friend of Ha\u0161ek and a social democrat from Slovakia's Smer party, leading to allegations of clientelism. In October 2013, shortly after the Czech legislative election, Ha\u0161ek and his allies from \u010cSSD called on party Chairman Bohuslav Sobotka to resign following the party's poor election result and excluded him from the team negotiating the next government. However, it was subsequently revealed that Ha\u0161ek and his allies had attended a secret post-election meeting with Czech President Milo\u0161 Zeman, and were alleged to have negotiated a \"coup\" in the \u010cSSD with him. Ha\u0161ek had previously denied the accusations, stating on Czech Television that \"there was no meeting\". However, his allies, deputies Milan Chovanec, Zden\u011bk \u0160kromach, Jeron\u00fdm Tejc and Ji\u0159\u00ed Zimola, later admitted that the meeting took place. The event sparked public protests in the country and led to a public apology from Ha\u0161ek, though he refused to resign. ==Personal life== Ha\u0161ek is married and has one daughter. ==References== ==External links== * Homepage * Chamber of Deputies profile Category:1976 births Category:People from Brno Category:Living people Category:Czech Social Democratic Party MPs Category:Masaryk University alumni Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic (2013\u20132017) Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic (2010\u20132013) Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic (2006\u20132010) Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic (2002\u20132006) ",
