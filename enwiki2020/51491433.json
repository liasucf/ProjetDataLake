    "text": "William H. Fauver Youth Correctional Facility (Formerly known as Mountainview Youth Correctional Facility) is a New Jersey Department of Corrections state prison young adult offenders ages 18-30, located in the Annandale section of Clinton Township in Hunterdon County, New Jersey, United States. The present- day facility has a maximum capacity of 808 juvenile inmates. The grounds encompass \"747 acres of rolling hills\", first used by the state in 1913 for a farm facility for the mentally ill. It was redesignated as a corrections site for males between 16 and 26, \"Annandale Farms\", in 1929. From at least 2008, William H. Fauver Youth Correctional Facility has had a difficult history. Two inmates have been murdered inside in recent years (Carl J. Epps, Jr. in August 2010, and Joshua Jones in August 2012), amid a long litany of assaults, drugs offenses, and inappropriate romantic relationships. ==References== == External links == * A set of vintage photographs Category:1929 establishments in New Jersey Category:Clinton Township, New Jersey Category:Prisons in New Jersey Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1929 Category:Buildings and structures in Hunterdon County, New Jersey ",
