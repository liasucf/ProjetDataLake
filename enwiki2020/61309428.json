He was one of the first Native American leaders to establish trade with European settlers in the area. In 1794, he was involved in the Battle of Fallen Timbers, which was the final battle of the Northwest Indian War. During the War of 1812, Noonday was allied with Tecumseh during the Battle of the Thames. Tecumseh was killed in this battle, and Noonday inherited his tomahawk and hat. ==Legacy== The Chief Noonday Outdoor Center and Chief Noonday Recreational Heritage Route in that area are named after him. In 2010, sculptor Antonio Tobias Mendez completed a seven-foot-tall bronze statue of Noonday. The statue was placed near Grand Valley State University's Eberhard Center, along the Grand River in Grand Rapids. Part of the Grand Rapids Community Legends Program, the statue is one of 25 planned sculptures intended to educate the public about local historical figures. ==References== ==External links== *Yankee Springs Recreation Area *Noahquageshik statue entry in the GVSU art gallery Category:Native American leaders Category:18th-century Native Americans ",
