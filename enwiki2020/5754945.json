    "text": "Mercury(I) sulfide or mercurous sulfide is a hypothetical chemical compound of mercury and sulfur, with elemental formula . Its existence has been disputed; it may be stable below 0 \u00b0C or in suitable environments, but is unstable at room temperature, decomposing into metallic mercury and mercury(II) sulfide (mercuric sulfide, cinnabar). Ronald L. Rich (2007): \"Zinc through Mercury\". In: Inorganic Reactions in Water, pages 289\u2013306. Published by Springer. ==History== This compound was described in the 19th century by Berzelius as a black precipitate obtained by passing hydrogen sulfide through solutions of mercury(I) saltsBerzelius, Lehrb.Berzelius: Archiv des Apotheker Vereins im n\u00f6rdlichen Deutschland.Charles Baskerville (1903): \"Mercurous sulphide\". Journal of the American Chemical Society, volume 25, issue 8, pages 799\u2013800. . As of 1825, the London Pharmacopoeia listed a compound called \"Ethiops- mineral\" or Hydrargyri Sulphuretum Nigrum (\"black sulfide of mercury\"), a black powder that was obtained by combining solid sulfur and mercury at room temperature. This preparation did not leave the characteristic stain of metallic mercury when rubbed onto gold. When a large amount of Ethiops-mineral was vigorously ground, however, it formed mercury and cinnabar with evolution of smoke and heat. However, the existence of mercurous sulfide was disputed in 1816 by French pharmacist N. Guibourt. In his thesis he claimed that the precipitate obtained in such a manner was nothing more than an intimate mixture of mercury(II) sulfide (mercuric sulfide, cinnabar) and metallic mercury , which could be separated by heating or grinding. (Guibourt also denied the reality of mercurous oxide , for the same reason.)Nicolas-Jean- Baptiste-Gaston Guibourt (1816): \"Th\u00e8se sur le Mercure et sur ses Combinaisons avec l\u2019Oxig\u00e8ne et le Soufre\". \u00c9cole Sp\u00e9ciale de PharmacieNicolas-Jean- Baptiste-Gaston Guibourt (1816): \"Th\u00e8se sur le Mercure et sur ses Combinaisons avec l\u2019Oxig\u00e8ne et le Soufre\".

Reviewing Guibourt's article in 1825, British chemist W. T. Brande disputed his conclusions. He observed that the proportions of mercury and sulfur in the precipitate are stoichometric for the formula ; and that nitrogen triiodide, silver fulminate, and mercury fulminate were accepted compounds, even though they were decomposed by slight friction. He claimed that the black precipitate did not show any sign of metallic mercury or cinnabar (although it was easily decomposed into them). He also noted that hot nitric acid does not attack cinnabar, whereas it quickly turns precipitated \"mercurous sulfide\" to mercuric nitrate without leaving any residue. In 1894, Italian chemists Antony and Sestini claimed to have determined that mercurous sulfide was stable at \u201310 \u00b0C, but disproportionated into and when heated to 0 \u00b0C.Ubaldo Antony and Quirino Sestini (1894): Gazetta chimica italiana, volume 24 (XXIV), issue 1, pages 193-198.W. J. P. abstractor (1894): \"Mercurous sulphide\".Journal of the Chemical Society, Abstracts, volume 66, pages B318\u2013B319. ==Chemical properties== According to W. T. Brande, mercurous sulfide is easily decomposed by trituration, exposure to sunlight, or heating to 300 \u00b0F. It reacts with hot nitric acid yielding mercuric nitrate. Boiling with potassium carbonate (\"potassa\", potash) removes part of the sulfur leaving pure cinnabar as residue. ==Structure== The structural formula is supposed to contain two mercury atoms bound to each other, as in the real compound mercury(I) chloride (calomel), . The latter is an ionic compound with the dimercury(I) cation, or +Hg\u2013Hg+, and chloride anions . However, like cinnabar, may be a covalent polymer rather than an ionic compound. Many stable polymeric mercury compounds with the bonding system E-Hg-Hg-E (E = N,P,As,Sb,O,S,Se,Sn) have been described since 1958.Klaus Brodersen, G\u00fcnter Liehr, and Wolfgang R\u00f6lz(1975): \"Stabile Quecksilber(I)\u2010Schwefel\u2010Verbindungen, 1\". Chemische Berichte, volume 108, issue 10, pages 3243\u20133246, One may also note that the stable compound , recently synthesized, was found to consist of two-dimensional polymeric cations [\u2013(S\u2013)\u2013Hg\u2013Hg\u2013(S\u2013Hg\u2013)\u2013Hg\u2013 balanced by one-dimensional polymeric anions [\u2013\u2013. In the cations, the sulfur atoms are trivalent, and the mercury atoms are divalent. In each unit, two of the mercury atoms form S\u2013Hg\u2013S bridges, while the other two form an S\u2013Hg\u2013Hg\u2013S bridge.Alois Lecker (2011): \"Synthese, Strukturchemie und physikalische Untersuchungen an Mangan-, Eisen- und Quecksilber-Chalkogenometallatverbindungen\". Dr. rer. nat. thesis, University of Regensburg; page 95.Alois Lecker and Arno Pfitzner (2008): \"Synthese und Charakterisierung von \". Zeitschrift fur anorganische und allgemeine Chemie, volume 634, issue 11, pages 2057. ==Preparation== ===New insight=== New insights that might lead to the successful synthesis of has been coming since 1958 through the work of Klaus Brodersen and others. The reaction between dimercury(I) salts and Lewis bases in polar solvents normally destroys the Hg\u2013Hg bond. The successful preparation of S\u2013Hg\u2013Hg\u2013S compounds can be achieved with nonpolar solvents, weak Lewis bases, and NH acidic nitrogen compounds. ===Older claims=== In the 19th and early 20th centuries, several preparation routes for have been described, but their reliability is questionable. According to W. T. Brande (1825), mercurous sulfide can be reliably obtained by passing through a very dilute solution of mercurous chloride (calomel) or nitrate, and carefully filtering the black precipitate. According to 19th- century pharmacopoeia, the preparation Ethiops-mineral, claimed to be mercurous sulfide, was prepared by gentle grinding of equal parts of mercury and sulfur, until the mercury globules were no longer visible. According to Scherer, could be obtained by reaction of mercurous nitrate and sodium thiosulfate . However, a review of the procedure by J. T. Norton in 1900 cast doubts on the claim.John T. Norton Jr. (1900), \"The Titration of Meroury by Sodium Thiosulphate\". American Journal of Science, volume 10, issue 55, article V, pages 48\u201354. A report from 1903 by American chemist Charles Baskerville claims that sulfuric acid left over metallic mercury in a closed bottle for over 5 years developed a crust over the metal that was found to be mercurous sulfide. ==References== Category:Hypothetical chemical compounds Category:Mercury(I) compounds ",
