They were active in the period 1736-1783 and usually signed their works in Greek \"By the hands of Konstantinos and Athanasios from Korytsa (Kor\u00e7\u00eb)\" ().Kirchhainer p. 152 Konstantinos signed many of his works (usually portable icons) as \"\u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 A\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2\" (aka, Konstantinos the Albanian). Their surname, Zografi, means \"painter\" in , . ==Technique== The work of the Zografi brothers has a marked tendency towards the baroque, with linear depictions of the religious figures, and at the same time adopting an ornamental style using a wide variety of brown and bright colors.Kirchhainer p. 188 The main colors used in their works were white, bright blue, and dark red.Kirchhainer p. 189 Zografi brothers together with David Selenicasi continued the tradition of the Palaeologan art that was revived at Mount Athos during 18th century. ==References== ==Sources== * ==External links== *Karin Kirchhainer: Die Malereien in den Gew\u00f6lbezonen der Kuppelbasiliken von Voskopoje (Moschopolis).
