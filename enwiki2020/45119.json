The Luna 21 spacecraft landed on the Moon and deployed the second Soviet lunar rover, Lunokhod 2, in January 1973.Lunokhod 02, NASA Solar System Exploration; page updated March 15, 2018. Retrieved May 31, 2018.NSSDC Catalog, Luna 21/Lunokhod 2, version March 21, 2017. Retrieved May 31, 2018. The primary objectives of the mission were to collect images of the lunar surface, examine ambient light levels to determine the feasibility of astronomical observations from the Moon, perform laser ranging experiments from Earth, observe solar X-rays, measure local magnetic fields, and study the soil mechanics of the lunar surface material. == Lunokhod 2 rover and subsystems == Detail of Lunokhod's wheels The rover stood high and had a mass of . It was about long and wide and had eight wheels each with an independent suspension, electric motor and brake. The rover had two speeds, about . Lunokhod 2 was equipped with three television cameras, one mounted high on the rover for navigation, which could return high resolution images at different frame rates\u20143.2, 5.7, 10.9 or 21.1 seconds per frame. These images were used by a five-man team of controllers on Earth who sent driving commands to the rover in real time. Power was supplied by a solar panel on the inside of a round hinged lid which covered the instrument bay, which would charge the batteries when opened. A polonium-210 radioisotope heater unit was used to keep the rover warm during the long lunar nights. There were four panoramic cameras mounted on the rover. Scientific instruments included a soil mechanics tester, solar X-ray experiment, an astrophotometer to measure visible and ultraviolet light levels, a magnetometer deployed in front of the rover on the end of a 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) boom, a radiometer, a photodetector (Rubin-1) for laser detection experiments, and a French-supplied laser corner reflector. The lander carried a bas relief of Vladimir Lenin and the State Emblem of the Soviet Union. The lander and rover together massed 1814 kg. == Mission == The Proton-K/D launcher put the spacecraft into Earth parking orbit followed by translunar injection. On January 12, 1973 Luna 21 was braked into a lunar orbit. On January 13 and 14, the perilune was lowered to altitude. == Landing and surface operations == On January 15 after 40 orbits, the braking rocket was fired at altitude, and the craft began to de- orbit. At an altitude of the main thrusters began firing, slowing the fall until a height of was reached. At this point the main thrusters shut down and the secondary thrusters ignited, slowing the fall until the lander was above the surface, where the engine was switched off. Landing occurred at 23:35 UT in Le Monnier crater at 25.85 degrees N, 30.45 degrees E. After landing, the Lunokhod 2 took TV images of the surrounding area, then rolled down a ramp to the surface at 01:14 UT on January 16 and took pictures of the Luna 21 lander and landing site, driving for 30 metres. After a period of charging up its batteries, it took more pictures of the site and the lander, and then set off to explore the moon. The rover would run during the lunar day, stopping occasionally to recharge its batteries with the solar panels. At night the rover hibernated until the next sunrise, heated by the radioactive source. * January 18, 1973 to January 24, 1973: The rover drives 1,260 metres * February 8 to 23: The rover drives 9,086 metres further * March 11 to 23: The rover drives 16,533 metres further * April 9 to 22: The rover drives 8,600 metres further * May 8 to June 3: The rover drives 880 metres further Scheme of Lunokhod mission == End of mission == On June 4, 1973 it was announced that the program was completed, leading to speculation that the vehicle probably failed in mid-May or could not be revived after the lunar night of May\u2013June. More recently, Alexander Basilevsky related an account in which on May 9, the rover's open lid touched a crater wall and became covered with dust. When the lid was closed, this dust (a very good insulator) was dumped on to the radiators. The following day, May 10, controllers saw the internal temperature of Lunokhod 2 climb as it was unable to cool itself, eventually rendering the rover inoperable. On May 11, signal from the rover was lost. == Results == Driving Distances by rovers on Mars and the Moon. Lunokhod 2 operated for about four months, and the original estimate was that it covered of terrain, including hilly upland areas and rilles, and sent back 86 panoramic images and over 80,000 TV pictures. Many mechanical tests of the surface, laser ranging measurements, and other experiments were completed during this time. Lunokhod 2 was thought to have covered based on wheel rotations but Russian scientists at the Moscow State University of Geodesy and Cartography (MIIGAiK) revised that to an estimated distance of about based on Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) images of the lunar surface.

On March 17, 2010 Phil Stooke at the University of Western Ontario announced that he had located Lunokhod 2 in NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) images, Space.com. but later images showed the initial identification was incorrect (the identified point was a mark in the rover tracks near the end of the route, made as Lunokhod 2 turned around), and the LRO LROC team identified the correct location of the rover in March 2012.NASA, LROC Coordinates of Robotic Spacecraft 2013, Update September 25, 2013.

Garriott), who stated in a 2001 interview with Computer Games Magazine's Cindy Yans that: :I purchased Lunakod 21 from the Russians. I am now the world's only private owner of an object on a foreign celestial body.
