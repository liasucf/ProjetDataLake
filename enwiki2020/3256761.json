    "text": "A Lord of the Bedchamber, previously known as a Gentleman of the Bedchamber, was a courtier in the Royal Household; the term was first used in 1718. Their duties originally consisted of assisting the monarch with dressing, waiting on him when he ate, guarding access to his bedchamber and closet and providing companionship. Such functions became less important over time but provided proximity to the monarch and the holders were thus trusted confidants and often extremely powerful. The offices were in the gift of The Crown and were originally sworn by Royal Warrant directed to the Lord Chamberlain.
