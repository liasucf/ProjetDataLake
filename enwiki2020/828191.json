    "text": "Peter Anthony Salisbury (born 24 September 1971) is an English rock drummer, best known as the drummer for The Verve, whom he co-founded in 1989. == Personal life == Salisbury resides in Derbyshire with his wife Pam, sons Ben and Isaac, and step son Joe. == The Verve == The Verve reunited in June, 2007 for a new tour and a future album. Pete is believed to have been the one behind getting the ball rolling in terms of reuniting the band. After Ashcroft (currently residing in Liverpool) learned that Salisbury, was in contact with the former guitarist, Nick McCabe, over a possible side project, Ashcroft used this as an excuse to call McCabe. Ashcroft made peace with him and bassist Simon Jones and the band reformed. In a band interview with the NME in 2007, Salisbury said that the problems between them were not that bad in the first place. == Other musical projects == After the band's demise in 1999, Salisbury played with various bands including Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. He filled in on a UK/EU tour in 2002 when their original drummer Nick Jago could not get a working visa for BRMC's British gigs. Salisbury owns and runs a drum shop, \"Drummin\", in Stockport, England. He played drums on the first three of Richard Ashcroft's solo albums. In October 2010, Salisbury played drums on The Charlatans UK tour while their regular drummer Jon Brookes was undergoing treatment for a brain tumour. Brookes died in 2013, and Salisbury has continued to work as The Charlatans drummer since then, though he has not been made a full member of the band. ==References== Category:English drummers Category:British male drummers Category:Living people Category:1971 births Category:Musicians from Bath, Somerset Category:The Verve members Category:21st-century drummers ",
