It is owned by CPS Media and is known as Radiante FM. ==History== XHPSJC was awarded in the IFT-4 radio auction of 2017 and came to air on September 3, 2018. It was the last of the three Radiante stations to sign on. CPS Media, an arm of Grupo Editorial Tribuna, was formed from the three FM stations won in the IFT-4 auction by Compa\u00f1\u00eda Period\u00edstica Sudcaliforniana (San Jos\u00e9 del Cabo, La Paz and Puerto Vallarta), as well as the three TV transmitters in the same cities that were won in the IFT-6 television station auction. Attempts by Tribuna to enter broadcasting had stretched back to 1995, when the company made requests for the federal government to make available new commercial radio stations. While these were approved in early 2000, the government of Vicente Fox did not award any of the stations. ==References== Category:Radio stations in Baja California Sur Category:Radio stations established in 2018 Category:2018 establishments in Mexico ",
