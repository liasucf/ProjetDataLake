    "text": "The Veterans Memorial Bridge is a bascule bridge connecting Somerset, Massachusetts and Fall River, Massachusetts. The bridge carries U.S. Route 6 and Route 138 over the Taunton River, with connecting ramps to Route 79, and includes a bike path on its north side. The $290 million bridge was dedicated to area veterans on September 11, 2011.Herald News, September 12, 2011 The bike path was also dedicated in a separate ceremony that same day in honor of Pvt. Michael E. Bouthot, who was killed in action in Iraq in 2006.Honor the Fallen The Veterans Memorial Bridge now serves as the pathway for Route 6 and Route 138 to cross the river into Fall River. Other than the Berkley-Dighton Bridge 8\u00bd miles to the north, it is the only non-highway bridge spanning the river between Fall River and Taunton. Along with the Braga Bridge, it is one of the two major crossings of the river. This has led to the bridge having vital importance anytime there is a problem on the Braga; since the northern detour takes approximately twenty miles and the southern detour (over the Mount Hope Bridge and the Sakonnet River Bridge) is over twenty-five miles, it immediately becomes the major path for people coming in and out of the city, and vice versa. ==Name== Before being named, this bridge was known as the replacement Brightman Street Bridge.MassHighway project status page The name \"Miguel Corte-Real Bridge\" was also suggested for use on the new bridge. On November 13, 2009, Chapter 140 of the Acts of 2009 became law, officially naming this bridge the Veterans Memorial Bridge.Chapter 140 of the Acts of 2009: An Act Designating a Certain Bridge in the City of Fall River and the Town of Somerset as the Veterans Memorial Bridge ==History== Planning for this bridge started no later than 1998, but was delayed due to its funding being siphoned off by the Big Dig project. Construction finally began in May 2007. After much delay, the dedication ceremony for the bridge occurred on September 11, 2011. The westbound lane opened to traffic on September 12, 2011,Herald News, August 8, 2011 with the eastbound lanes opening on October 11, 2011.Herald News, October 11, 2011 ==Gallery== Image:New Brightman Street Bridge.JPG|The construction site of the new Brightman Street bridge as of June 2008 File:VMB center span.jpg|Center span under construction, August 2010 File:Veterans Memorial Bridge, Fall River MA.jpg|View of the roadway from the pedestrian path ==Bridge features== The Veterans Memorial Bridge features upgrades from the previous Brightman Street Bridge, including a much wider walkway/bikeway and fishing pier. The center span is also significantly taller and wider than the Brightman's, decreasing the frequency of traffic delays from the bridge opening due to a passing boat underneath. ==See also== * List of crossings of the Taunton River ==References== ==External links== * MassHighway project status page * Deep Foundations Institute article (commercial) * Jay Cashman Marine project portfolio page * Category:Bridges over the Taunton River Category:Bascule bridges in the United States Category:Bridges completed in 2011 Category:Bridges in Bristol County, Massachusetts Category:Monuments and memorials in Massachusetts Category:Road bridges in Massachusetts Category:U.S. Route 6 Category:Bridges on the United States Numbered Highways ",
