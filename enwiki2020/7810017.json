Very surprisingly he came to the top in the 500 m in Vikingskipet at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer. He didn't place himself in the top three in any other international championship after that. But he stands with one individual victory on 500 m in the World Cup from 1993. ==External links== * * Category:1972 births Category:Russian male speed skaters Category:Olympic gold medalists for Russia Category:Olympic speed skaters of Russia Category:Olympic speed skaters of the Unified Team Category:Speed skaters at the 1992 Winter Olympics Category:Speed skaters at the 1994 Winter Olympics Category:Speed skaters at the 1998 Winter Olympics Category:Living people Category:People from Kostroma Category:Olympic medalists in speed skating Category:Medalists at the 1994 Winter Olympics Category:Sportspeople from Kostroma Oblast ",
