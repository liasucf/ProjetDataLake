    "text": "Notion, previously stylized as NOTION, is a computer software program for music composition and performance created by NOTION Music (a company located in Greensboro, North Carolina, originally known as Virtuosoworks), and now owned by PreSonus. Notion is available for use on Microsoft Windows, macOS and iOS. ==Composition== Notion allows users to perform composition using a computer keyboard/mouse, MIDI keyboard, MIDI guitar, MIDI file, MusicXML file, or handwriting recognition. The application automatically handles aspects of music notation based on the input, such as stem direction and alignment of different rhythmic values.See article by Brian Humpherson in Zone Magazine, 2008 Issue 16 Notion also supports the input and output of notation in tablature form, synchronized with the standard music notation. Notion also provides an audio mixer to set volume levels, perform panning, and add effects such as equalization, compression and reverb. From version 3 onward, Notion also supports ReWire, third-party VST effects and other third-party sound libraries, including presets for products from the Vienna Symphonic Library, EastWest, Miroslav Philharmonik, and Garritan Personal Orchestra. ==Playback and Performance== Notion's sample library for playback was recorded at Abbey Road by the London Symphony Orchestra. The playback engine provides options for real-time tempo control as it interprets score marks, such as articulations and performance techniques.Expanded on by editor review in Computer Music, February 2008 Users can also capture playback in wav digital audio files for transfer to CD or digital audio workstation, or for conversion to other audio formats such as mp3 or wma. == Integration with Studio One == Starting with version 3.3 in 2016, the Studio One DAW (also developed by PreSonus) is integrated with Notion (version 6 and above). This integration allows the two applications to perform real-time audio and MIDI streaming (via either ReWire or PreSonus' own UCNET protocol) to transfer audio, note, track, VST and score data directly between each other. This connectivity can occur either with both applications running on the same computer, or on multiple computers connected to the same network. This integration was expanded further by Notion versions 6.4 (May 2018, following the release of the Chord track for Studio One in version 4), which allowed the transfer of chord-level information between the two applications, and 6.5 (Jan 2019), which enabled the automatic translation of drum tracks into standard percussion notation. ==See also== * PreSonus *Studio One (software) * Progression (software) * List of music software ==Notes== ==External links== * Category:Scorewriters ",
