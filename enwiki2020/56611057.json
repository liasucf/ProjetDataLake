He attended Library Avenue Primary school, Umuahia, Abia State, and went to Government College Umuahia for his secondary education. His university education was at University Nigeria Nsukka, where he studied law. He obtained his law degree in 1992 and was called to the Nigerian Bar in 1994. While on campus, he floated a small company which he named De-Zulu. Later, he grew more interested in the art of photography and eventually, after long years of practice, became a founding member of the Nigerian photography collective Depth of Field, which had as one of its members, TY Bello who would also go on to be a successful photographer and musician. Amadi-Obi in an interview with Onebello, a fashion magazine, when asked why he dumped law for photography, said the choice wasn't between photography and law, but between photography and art. He said he had always been an artist right from childhood. His work have been exhibited at the Lagos Photo Festival, Didi Museum, Rele Art Gallery, and other places. == Depth of Field == In 2001, Amadi-Obi helped co-found Depth of Field (DOF) a collective of Nigerian photographers, artist and painters. It was an initiative of popular Nigerian photographer Uche James Iroha, ace photographer TY Bello, Amaize Ojeikere, Emeka Okereke, Kelechi Amad-Obi and Zainab Balogun, which took off after the six artists met in Bamako, Mali, during an art exhibition named Memories Intimes D\u2019un Nouveau Milleanaire Ives Recontres de la Photo (Bamako, 2001).
