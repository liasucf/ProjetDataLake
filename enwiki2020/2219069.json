    "text": "Fosse Shopping Park is one of Britain's biggest out-of-town shopping parks and it is situated in Enderby parish, in Blaby district, on the southern edge of the city of Leicester, England. The retail park is in an area of mixed industrial and commercial development, about half a mile from Junction 21 of the M1, where it meets the M69. Junction 21 also connects the M1 with the A5460 (Narborough Road), from the centre of Leicester, and Leicester's main ringroad, the A563. As of 2016, it is one of \"about twenty\" retail parks owned by the Crown Estate. ==History== London & Edinburgh Trust opened Fosse Park in 1989, the development contained 12 retail warehouses, including Marks & Spencer as an anchor store. In 1996 Castlemore Securities bought an adjacent factory from the shoe manufacturer and retailer, the Oliver Group, for \u00a325m and obtained a restricted planning consent for Fosse Park South. In 1997 Pillar Property bought Fosse Park South for \u00a352.5m from Castlemore and the original Fosse Park from SPP (the Swedish pension fund that owns LET) for \u00a360m, thus uniting both halves of the park to create a investment valued at \u00a3205m a year later. In 2004 Pillar attempted to sell Fosse Park, but withdrew when its \u00a3320m valuation was not achieved. In 2005 Reit Asset Management bought Fosse Park for \u00a3308m, while Pillar's had valued it at \u00a3350m. In 2006 Irish investors bought Fosse Park for \u00a3360m before placing it on the market once again in 2010. When opened in 1989, Fosse Park commanded an average rent of \u00a311/sq ft. . this has risen to \u00a3105/sq ft, higher than any other retail park in the UK. ==Stores== Below are just a few of the many stores - as of August 2016 the shopping park contains: Argos Extra, Boots, Superdrug, KFC, Marks & Spencer, Next, Primark, SportsDirect.com and W H Smith. ==Transport== Fosse Shopping Park is serviced by bus routes operated by Arriva Midlands, Centrebus and Travel De Courcey. ==References== ==External links== * Fosse Shopping Park official website Category:Shopping centres in Leicestershire Category:Retail parks in the United Kingdom ",
