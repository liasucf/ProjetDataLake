    "text": "The Cane Hill Battlefield is a historic district encompassing the battlefield of the Battle of Cane Hill, fought during the American Civil War on November 28, 1862, in and around the site of present-day Cane Hill, Arkansas. Because the battle was a running battle that extended over many hours and of roads, the battlefield is more than in size, extending in all directions around Cane Hill. The northern section of the battlefield is an agricultural area that is little-altered except for the introduction of new roadways and rural buildings, and the abandonment of old roadway alignments. The southern section is hillier and more wooded, and is altered in similar ways. The battlefield area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Military installations established in 1862 Category:Geography of Washington County, Arkansas Category:American Civil War battlefields Category:Arkansas in the American Civil War Category:1862 establishments in Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Washington County, Arkansas Category:Battlefields of the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War Category:Conflict sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:American Civil War on the National Register of Historic Places ",
