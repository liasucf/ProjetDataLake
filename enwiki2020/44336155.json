    "text": "Mexico is the ninth studio album by the Icelandic electronic musicians GusGus, released on Kompakt label, following successful album Arabian Horse. It contains nine tracks, one of which is instrumental. After several line-up changes, Mexico was produced by Stephan Stephensen (aka President Bongo) and Birgir \u00de\u00f3rarinsson (aka Biggi Veira). H\u00f6gni Egilsson of Hjaltal\u00edn, Dan\u00edel \u00c1g\u00fast Haraldsson and Ur\u00f0ur H\u00e1konard\u00f3ttir made appearance as vocalists for this LP. The album title Mexico is a metaphor of \"going west\", as humans always tend to go in a westerly direction. Dan\u00edel, who came up with this idea as a name for an album, felt very strongly it. H\u00f6gni lately explained that \"sometimes the things that stand out lay behind meaning and intellectuality\" and that \"It\u2019s not necessarily something that we can describe in any way.\" ==Track listing== All songs written by GusGus. ==Chart positions== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |+Chart performance for Mexico |- !
