The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Wabtec Corporation, and traces its history back to the MK Rail division of Morrison- Knudsen. == History == Morrison-Knudsen established a separate rail division, MK Rail, in 1972. Morrison-Knudsen spun-off the division in 1993; it became a publicly traded company in 1994. After Morrison-Knudsen's bankruptcy in 1996, MK Rail renamed itself MotivePower Industries, doing business as Boise Locomotive. The company merged with Westinghouse Air Brake Company in November 1999 to form the Wabtec Corporation. Wabtec renamed the Boise Locomotive division to MotivePower in 2000. MotivePower continues as a wholly owned subsidiary of Wabtec. On September 18, 2019 several months following Wabtec's merger with GE Transportation, Wabtec announced the MotivePower Boise plant will close in early 2020 and production shifted to Wabtec's legacy GE Transportation plant in Erie, Pennsylvania.https://idahonews.com/news/local/motivepower-closing-boise- office-moving-to-pennsylvaniaWabtec to close MotivePower plant Railway Gazette International September 21, 2019 == Products == MotivePower's flagship product is the MPI MPXpress passenger locomotive.
