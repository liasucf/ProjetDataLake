    "text": "Example of an urban castle: the old fortification of Wei\u00dfenstein with the castle in the west An urban castle () is a castle that is located within a medieval town or city or is integrated into its fortifications. In most cases, the town or city grew up around or alongside the castle (for example in Halle, Brunswick and Prague), or the castle was built in order to reinforce the defences within or as part of the line of fortification ringing the settlement as, for example, at Erfurt. == Definitions == Creighton draws a distinction between the 'urban castle', where the castle is built in or onto an existing town, and the 'castle borough', \"where a primary castle attracts a secondary borough or the two are planned together,\"Creighton (2002), 133. although he acknowledges that the division between the two is not always clear-cut. == Instrument of sovereign power == The urban castle was also be used as an instrument of power, for example by William the Conqueror in Norman England,Creighton (2002), 36. or by territorial lords in the Holy Roman Empire when towns in the late Middle Ages were increasingly striving for their independence. In such cases the urban castle was integrated into a strategically favourable point in the city wall so that the lord could enter the castle from the fields outside unhindered by the citizens and, through another gateway in the castle walls facing the city, could leave the castle and enter the city. == Examples == === Austria === * Krems in Lower Austria, has the Gozzoburg, a high mediaeval urban castle. === Czech Republic === *Prague Castle in Prague === Germany === There are examples of urban castles in: * Andernach in Rhineland-Palatinate where the Electoral Cologne Stadtburg (designed as a water castle) as an instrument of power * Erfurt with its Petersberg Citadel, which is integrated into the defensive system of the old fortified city * Esslingen am Neckar: the original outposts on the Sch\u00f6nenberg were gradually incorporated into the town fortifications through the construction of branching walls (Schenkelmauern). Due to the geological situation there, the cost was very high. * Feuchtwangen in Bavaria still has, in the remains of its town walls, a picturesque link to the site of Little Ottingen Castle (\u00d6ttingischen Schl\u00f6sschen), a former water castle, which juts out from the otherwise circular town wall. Later a small hunting lodge was built on the site * Friedberg in Hesse has an imperial castle * Horn-Bad Meinberg in North Rhine-Westphalia has Horn Castle, a castle built into the town's defences * Nuremberg: the double castle is incorporated into the city wall * Schlitz in Hesse, one of the best-known examples of urban castles in Germany with four castles. * Warburg has Wartberch Castle. * Wei\u00dfenstein with the old castle of Schloss Wei\u00dfenstein === Ethiopia === *Emperor Fasilides' Castle (part of the Fasil Ghebbi complex) in Gondar ===Finland=== *Turku Castle in Finland === Hungary === *Buda Castle in Budapest *S\u00e1rospatak Castle in S\u00e1rospatak === Poland === *Wawel Castle in Krakow (part of the Wawel fortified complex of the Krakow Old Town) === Romania === *Bra\u0219ov Old Town Fortress, Bra\u0219ov === Slovakia === *Bratislava Castle in Bratislava (fortified site history preceding adjacent city) *Tren\u010d\u00edn Castle in Tren\u010d\u00edn *Nitra Castle in Nitra (parallel evolution of the castle and the city since the early Middle Ages) *Old Castle (Star\u00fd z\u00e1mok) in Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica (secondary Old Town development, late Middle Ages) *New Castle (Nov\u00fd z\u00e1mok) in Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica (secondary Old Town development, Renaissance) *Kremnica Castle in Kremnica (secondary Old Town development, late Middle Ages) *Podol\u00ednec Castle in Podol\u00ednec *Ke\u017emarok Castle in Ke\u017emarok === Ukraine === * Uzhorod Castle in Uzhorod === United Kingdom === The Tower of London has been called \"the most complete of urban castles\",Pounds (1994), 231, 207. and an \"archetypally oppressive castle.\"Wheatley (2004, 52. Other examples include: * Baile Hill, York * Banbury Castle * Baynard's Castle * Bristol Castle * Castle Acre * Caernarvon Castle * Conway Castle * Flint Castle * Mountfichet Castle * Oxford Castle * Rhuddlan Castle == Gallery == File:Tower of London from the Shard (8515883950).jpg|London, United Kingdom File:Caernarfon Castle 1994.jpg|Caernarfon, United Kingdom File:Edinburgh Castle from the south east.JPG|Edinburgh, United Kingdom File:N\u00fcrnberg Burg ArM.jpg|Nuremberg, Germany File:Stadt schlitz 01.jpg|Schlitz, Germany File:Friedberg (Hessen) Schloss vom Adolfsturm.jpg|Friedberg, Germany File:Luftaufnahme Burg Gutenberg (Schloss Balzers).jpg|Balzers, Liechtenstein File:Rehberg (Krems) - Burgruine mit Kirche.JPG|Krems an der Donau, Austria File:Prag Altstadt Schloss 20110430.jpg|Prague, Czech Republic File:Wawel z mostu Debnickiego (2007).jpg|Krakow, Poland File:Budaivarnegyedlegifoto.jpg|Budapest, Hungary File:S\u00e1rospataki v\u00e1r - l\u00e9gi felv\u00e9telen.jpg|S\u00e1rospatak, Hungary File:Kremnica v zime.jpg|Kremnica, Slovakia File:Star\u00fd z\u00e1mok - Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica.jpg|Star\u00fd z\u00e1mok, Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica, Slovakia File:Nov\u00fd z\u00e1mok a star\u00e9 mesto, Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica.jpg|Nov\u00fd z\u00e1mok, Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica, Slovakia File:\u0417\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043a-\u0444\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0446\u044f \u0432\u0443\u043b. \u041a\u0430\u043f\u0456\u0442\u0443\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430, 33.jpg|Uzhorod, Ukraine File:Blick von der Innenstadt von Brasov zur Festung.JPG|Bra\u0219ov, Romania File:The Turku Castle - Turku, Finland - panoramio - Sergey Ashmarin.jpg|Turku, Finland ET Gondar asv2018-02 img03 Fasil Ghebbi.jpg|Gondar, Ethiopia == References == == External links == * Creighton, O.H.
