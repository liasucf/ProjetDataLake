The love story is not as simple as it appears to be. Surya starts trying to make Vaishali fall for him. After Vaishali falls in love with Surya and starts talking about marriage, Surya breaks up with her due to his fear of commitment as a result of his parents\u2019 failed marriage. Vaishali tells him that exactly after a year, they will meet in Kathmandu, Nepal and decided whether they should get married or not. Exactly after a year, the Nepal 2015 earthquake occurs, where Surya is searching for Vaishali. Simultaneously, Vaishali is searching for Surya in Kathmandu. Immediately after Surya spots Vaishali, she is injured and is diagnosed with retrograde amnesia (which nobody knows about) and still acts as if she is fine, with her friends and family except Surya. The rest of the story is how Surya realizes that Vaishali is actually diagnosed with retrograde amnesia and how he realizes that Vaishali is perfect for him. ==Cast== * Sharwanand as Surya * Sai Pallavi as Vaishali * Priya Raman as Surya's mother * Sampath Raj as Surya's father * Kalyani Natarajan as Vaishali's mother * Murali Sharma as Rama Rao, Vaishali's father * Priyadarshi Pullikonda as Darshi * Sunil as Chatur Ramalingam * Vennela Kishore as Gemini Natarajan * Kalpika as Vaishali's friend * Suhas as Surya's friend * Noel Sean as Shravan * Ajay as Dr. Rakesh * Mahadevan as Dhanraj Pillai * Ravi Kale as Nepal Police Officer * Satyam Rajesh as Eve Teaser * Kadambari Kiran as Chatur's father * Shatru as Dhanraj's henchman * Vinayak Ram Attili as Vaishali's neighbor * Appaji Ambarisha Darbha as Gokhale * Raju Sundaram as a goon (special appearance) ==Production== The film schedule was to start by the end of March, but since actress Sai Pallavi had dates only in February, the film start scheduled was preponed to February.
