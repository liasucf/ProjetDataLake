Le Roux was born in Amsterdam, the son of Pierre Le Roux, a goldsmith and son of Huguenot exiles. Pierre emigrated to London in 1680, became a naturalized citizen in 1682, and the family followed in 1683. Le Roux himself landed in New York City sometime before 1687, and worked thereafter as a silversmith and goldsmith in New York City, with his shop and residence on the west side of Broadway at Beaver Lane (now Morris Street). He was made a freeman on June 6, 1687, married Gertrude Van Rollegom on December 22, 1688, and served as assistant alderman 1702-1712. He was master to the following apprentices: Peter Van Dyck, 1700; Charles Le Roux, circa 1702; Lucas Stoutenburg, circa 1703; and John Le Roux, circa 1708-1713. Le Roux's work is collected in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Winterthur Museum, and Yale University Art Gallery. == References == * The New York Genealogical and Biographical Record, Volume 50, edited by Richard Henry Greene et al, New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, 1919, page 152. * Early American Silver in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Beth Carver Wees, Medill Higgins Harvey, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2013, page 125. * \"Bartholomew Le Roux\", American National Biography. * \"Bartholomew Le Roux\", Oxford Index. * American Silversmiths and Their Marks: The Definitive (1948) Edition, Stephen Guernsey Cook Ensko, Courier Corporation, 1983, page 85. * American silver at Winterthur, \"Bartholomew Le Roux I\", Ian M.
