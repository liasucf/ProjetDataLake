Population: ==History== It was first mentioned in 1858 as a village with four households that had existed since 1854. In 1869, the number of households increased to thirty- five. The construction of the Kazan\u2013Yekaterinburg railway during 1913\u20131920 played an important role in the development of the village. A settlement for the railway builders, which shared the same name, was established near the village. During the Civil War, the area of what is now Chernushinsky District saw heavy fighting along the railway and in the settlement itself. In 1925, the administrative center of the district was transferred from Ryabki to Chernushka because Ryabky was too far from the railway. Consequently, the district itself was renamed Chernushinsky. However, the district's administration did not move to Chernushka until 1930. The following years saw an increase of industrial construction. After World War II, Chernushka was granted work settlement status. The discovery of oil boosted Chernushka's development, as several oil plants were built in 1958. In 1966, Chernushka was granted town status. ==Administrative and municipal status== Within the framework of administrative divisions, Chernushka serves as the administrative center of Chernushinsky District, to which it is directly subordinated.Law #416-67 As a municipal division, the town of Chernushka, together with the settlement of Azinsky, is incorporated within Chernushinsky Municipal District as Chernushinskoye Urban Settlement.Law #1882-409 ==Economy== Chernushka railway station The town's economy is based on oil extraction and refining industry, the production of construction materials, and the food industry.
