    "text": "San Esteban de Deyo, also called the Castillo de Monjard\u00edn, is a ruined castle on a hill overlooking Villamayor de Monjard\u00edn in Navarre. The castle lies at an elevation of 890 metres. The castle has a Roman foundation, but was repeatedly rebuilt over the centuries. It was one of the last fortresses of the Banu Qasi, the local Muslim dynasty, before it was taken by King Sancho I of Navarre in 914. According to the Historia Caroli Magni et Rotholandi\u2014a legendary retelling of the lives of Charlemagne and Roland found in the 12th- century Codex Calixtinus\u2014the castle was actually taken by Charlemagne from a Navarrese prince named Furr\u00e9. Only the walls of the castle stand today. Many of the stones were taken to build a Baroque hermitage, the Ermita de San Esteban, in the 17th century.David M. Gitlitz and Linda Kay Davidson, The Pilgrimage Road to Santiago: The Complete Cultural Handbook (St. Martin's Press, 2000), p. 111. The ruins of San Esteban de Deyo were named a Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural de Navarra on 25 June 1985. ==Gallery== File:Villamayor de Monjard\u00edn - Castillo - DSC 9747.JPG|Well-preserved corner tower of the exterior wall File:Villamayor de Monjard\u00edn - Ermita del castillo - DSC 9757.JPG|Baroque hermitage constructed from the castle's stones File:Villamayor de Monjard\u00edn - Castillo - DSC 9734.JPG|Panorama of the surviving exterior wall File:Castillo de Villamayor de Monjard\u00edn.jpg|The castle, atop the hill on the left, would have dominated the landscape in the 10th century ==Notes== Category:Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural landmarks in Navarre Category:Castles in Navarre Category:Ruined castles in Spain ",
