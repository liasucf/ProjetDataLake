    "text": "Major General Mahmud Khan Pul\u0101deen (; d. February 1928), also spelled as Pouladeen, was a senior military leader of the Reza Shah Pahlavi era. In 1921, he served as personal guard to Seyyed Zia'eddin Tabatabaee. He was sent to various parts of Iran where tribal clashes were threatening stability. After Reza Shah Pahlavi ascended to the throne, Major General Puladeen was soon arrested on charges of conspiring to overthrow Reza Shah, along with Samuel Jem, a Jewish member of parliament. The court sentenced him to 10 years in prison, but Reza Shah insisted on his death sentence. Major General Sarteep Sheibani (a friend of Puladeen's) refused to carry out the death sentence and resigned from his post. Finally in 1928, he was executed in Bagh-Shah, Tehran, by firing squad. He managed to survive the firing squad's 21 bullets, but Major General Sar Lashgar Buzarjomehri went up to the wounded Puladeen and shot him in the head, finishing the execution. ==References== * 'Al\u00ed Riz\u0101 Awsat\u00ed (\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0631\u0636\u0627 \u0627\u0648\u0633\u0637\u0649), Iran in the Past Three Centuries (Ir\u0101n dar Se Qarn-e Goz\u0332ashteh - \u0627\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u0633\u0647 \u0642\u0631\u0646 \u06af\u0630\u0634\u062a\u0647), Volumes 1 and 2 (Pakt\u0101b Publishing - \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u067e\u0627\u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628, Tehran, Iran, 2003).
