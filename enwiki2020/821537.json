    "text": "The BMW M30 is a SOHC straight-six petrol engine which was produced from 1968 to 1995. With a production run of 27 years, it is BMW's longest produced engine and was used in many car models. The first models to use the M30 engine were the BMW 2500 and 2800 sedans. The initial M30 models were produced in displacements of , with later versions having displacements of up to . As per the BMW M10 four-cylinder engine from which the M30 was developed, the M30 has an iron block, an aluminium head and an overhead camshaft with two valves per cylinder. The engine was given the nicknames of 'Big Six' and 'Senior Six', following the introduction of the smaller BMW M20 straight-six engine in the late 1970s. The M30 was produced alongside the M20 throughout the M20's production, and prior to the introduction of the BMW M70 V12 engine in 1987, the M30 was BMW's most powerful and largest regular production engine. Following the introduction of the BMW M50 engine in 1990, the M30 began to be phased out. Ward's have rated the M30 as one of the \"Top Engines of the 20th Century\". ==Design== The M30 was originally developed in the late 1960s, loosely based on the BMW M10 four-cylinder engine first used in the BMW New Class sedans and coupes. Initially, the engine code was \"M06\", until it was later renamed the M30. Common features between the M10 and M30 include a profile lowering 30-degree slant to the right, a crossflow cylinder head (a gas flow head in later designs) and chain-driven camshaft with rocker arm valve actuation. Further similarities include a cast-iron block with an aluminium head and a forged crankshaft. The first two M30 engines introduced were the and the versions, which both used an bore. ==M90 engine== The M90 engine, used in several models from 1979-1982, combines the block from the motorsports BMW M88 DOHC engine with the M30's SOHC cylinder head. == Versions == {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !Version!!Displacement!!Power output!!Torque!!Year |- | M30B25V ||rowspan=2| ||rowspan=2| at 6,000 rpm || at 3,700 rpm ||1968 |- | M30B25 || at 3,700 rpm || 1981 |- | M30B28V ||rowspan=2| || at 6,000 rpm || at 3,700 ||1968 |- | M30B28 || at 5,800 rpm || at 4,200 rpm ||1977 |- | M30B30V ||rowspan=2| || at 6,000 rpm || at 3,700 rpm ||1971 |- | M30B30 || at 5,500 rpm || at 4,300 rpm ||1971 |- | M30B32 || || at 5,500 rpm || at 4,300 rpm ||1976 |- | M30B33V || || at 5,500 rpm || at 3,500 rpm ||1973 |- | M30B34 ||rowspan=2| || at 5,800 rpm || at 4,200 rpm |||1982 |- | M30B35 || at 5,700 rpm || at 4,000 rpm ||1988 |} === M30B25V === BMW M30 with carburettor in BMW Museum M30 production in Munich M30 production in Munich The first version of the M30 was introduced in the 1968 E3 2500.

These upgrades include Bosch Motronic engine management and an increased displacement to . The compression ratio was increased from 7.0:1 to 8.0:1. Peak power output is the same as the M102,http://www.bmwheaven.com/database/engine.php?type=M30#/135 however it occurs at lower RPMhttp://paultan.org/2008/01/24/the-m102-m106-in-the- bmw-745i-turbo/ and peak boost is reduced from .https://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_bmw_745i_turbo There was no direct successor to the M106, however BMW's next turbocharged petrol engine was the BMW N54, introduced in 2006. Applications: * 1982-1986 E23 745i ==Motorsport== E24 635 CSi Group A The M30 powered a series of E9 CSL and E24 6 Series coupes to European Touring Car Championship (ETCC) throughout the 1970s and into the middle 1980s, even though a more powerful DOHC 24-valve head had been developed for high-performance motorsports and street use.
