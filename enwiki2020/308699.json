    "text": "Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff (born 31 March 1939) is a German filmmaker who has worked in Germany, France and the United States. He was a prominent member of the New German Cinema of the late 1960s and early 1970s, which also included Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, Margarethe von Trotta and Rainer Werner Fassbinder. He won an Oscar as well as the Palme d'Or at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival for The Tin Drum (1979), the film version of the novel by Nobel Prize-winning author G\u00fcnter Grass.Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff at European Graduate School. Biography and bibliography. (Retrieved May 14, 2010) ==Early life== Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff was born in Wiesbaden, Germany to the physician Dr. Georg Schl\u00f6ndorff. In 1956 his family moved to Paris, where Schl\u00f6ndorff won awards at school for his work in philosophy. He graduated in political science at the Sorbonne, while at the same time studying film at the Institut des Hautes Etudes Cinematographiques, where he was friends with Bertrand Tavernier and met Louis Malle. Malle gave him his first job as his assistant director on Zazie in the Metro, which continued with the films A Very Private Affair, The Fire Within and Viva Maria!. Schl\u00f6ndorff also worked as assistant director on Alain Resnais's Last Year at Marienbad and Jean-Pierre Melville's L\u00e9on Morin, Priest. During this time he also made his first short film, Who Cares? about French people living in Frankfurt in 1960. In 1963 he collaborated with filmmaker Jean-Daniel Pollet on the 40-minute documentary M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. The film has been highly regarded since its initial release, gaining praise from Jean-Luc Godard and consistently appearing in the popular book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. ==Early film career== Schl\u00f6ndorff returned to Germany to make his feature film debut Young T\u00f6rless. Produced by Louis Malle and based on the famous novel The Confusions of Young T\u00f6rless by Robert Musil, the film debuted at the 1966 Cannes Film Festival. Taking place at a semi-military Austrian boarding school, T\u00f6rless witnesses the bullying of a fellow student but does nothing to prevent it despite his superior and mature intellect. He gradually begins to accept his personal responsibility for the abuse by doing nothing to stop it and runs away from the school. The comparison to pre-war Germany were obvious and the film was highly praised upon release, winning the FIPRESCI Prize at Cannes.Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 2. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1988. 983-987. The New German Cinema movement unofficially began in 1962 with the Oberhausen Manifesto, calling new young German filmmakers to revitalize filmmaking in Germany, much like the French New Wave and British New Wave of the previous few years. Although not among the initial group of filmmakers involved, Schl\u00f6ndorff was quick to align himself with the group and Young T\u00f6rless is considered one of the most important films of the New German Cinema. Schl\u00f6ndorff's next film was A Degree of Murder, a counter-culture saturated film with a musical score by Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones. The film stars Jones' then girlfriend (and later Keith Richards wife) Anita Pallenberg as a young waitress who accidentally kills her boyfriend and hides the body with the help of two male friends. The film was very popular upon release amongst \"swinging sixties\" youths. He then made another film that spoke to the counter culture generation, Michael Kohlhaas - Der Rebell. Set in medieval Germany, Michael Kohlhaas is a horse trader who has been cheated by a local nobleman and nearly starts a revolution to get revenge. The film starred David Warner, Anna Karina and Anita Pallenberg and was made in both German and English versions. Schl\u00f6ndorff then adapted Bertolt Brecht's first play Baal for television and cast an actor named Rainer Werner Fassbinder in the lead role, along with Margarethe von Trotta, whom Schl\u00f6ndorff would marry the following year. Schl\u00f6ndorff adapted the story of a self-destructive poet to modern day Munich and the film was shown on German TV in 1970. He then made another TV movie ', again starring Fassbinder. The film depicts 7 peasants in 19th Century Germany who rob the local tax collection cart but are so conditioned by their poverty that they cannot handle their newfound wealth. ' examined a group of people who have lost their sense of morals and co-starred von Trotta. Von Trotta would both star in and co-write Schl\u00f6ndorff's next film, A Free Woman. The film took a feminist look at the condition of modern women in Munich. von Trotta portrays Elizabeth Junker, a recently divorced woman who must struggle to live her life independently as her husband has everything come easily to him, including the villa and son that they had shared together as a married couple. The film is loosely based on von Trotta's experiences with her divorce from her first husband. Schl\u00f6ndorff then completed the TV movie \u00dcbernachtung in Tirol in 1974, an adaptation of the Henry James short story Les raisons de Georgina for German TV and directed his first opera in Frankfurt, a production of Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek's K\u00e1\u0165a Kabanov\u00e1 in 1974. ==International success as a filmmaker== Schl\u00f6ndorff (and the New German Cinema movement as a whole) had his first financial hit film with The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum in 1975. Based on the novel of the same name by Nobel Prize-winning German author Heinrich B\u00f6ll, Schl\u00f6ndorff both co-wrote and co- directed the film with Margarethe von Trotta in her directorial debut. The film stars Angela Winkler as Blum, who after falling in love and spending the night with a young army deserter becomes the victim of a corrupt police investigation and predatory tabloid newspaper, which cast her as both a terrorist and a prostitute. The newspaper is based upon the real right-wing German tabloid Bild-Zeitung, whose publisher Axel Springer was the inspiration for the character Werner T\u00f6tges. In Schl\u00f6ndorff's view, West Germany had fallen into political hysteria over the activities of the terrorist group the Red Army Faction. The police and journalistic activities in both B\u00f6ll's novel and Schl\u00f6ndorff's film portrayed the Red Army Faction era as reminiscent of McCarthyism in 1950s USA, including illegal police raids, phone tapping and tabloid smears. Although B\u00f6ll was heavily attacked after the publication of the novel, both novel and film were hugely successful in West Germany. After directing his second opera We Come to the River in 1976, Schl\u00f6ndorff followed The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum with the equally political Coup de Gr\u00e2ce in 1976. Based on a novel by French author Marguerite Yourcenar, the film stars von Trotta (who again co-wrote the script) as Sophie von Reval, a young left- wing aristocrat who sides with the Bolshevik Revolution after being rejected by a young German soldier preparing to fight the Red Army in 1919. The film depicts the same time period and subject matter that von Trotta would later revisit in the film Rosa Luxemburg. A supporting actress in Coup de Gr\u00e2ce was Valeska Gert, a former cabaret dancer, circus performer and silent film actress who had worked with Greta Garbo and G.W. Pabst. This led to the documentary about her life Just for Fun, Just for Play in 1977. Schl\u00f6ndorff then contributed to the omnibus film Germany in Autumn, in which nine German filmmakers (including Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Alexander Kluge, Edgar Reitz and author Heinrich B\u00f6ll) made short films depicting the hysteria and political chaos in West Germany during the German Autumn of 1977. Schl\u00f6ndorff's next film was the most successful and ambitious of his career, and perhaps the most important film of post-war Germany: The Tin Drum, released in 1979. The film was based on the novel by Nobel Prize-winning author G\u00fcnter Grass, who for years had rejected proposed adaptations of his book until giving Schl\u00f6ndorff his approval (and assistance) to make the film. The Tin Drum stars David Bennent as the protagonist Oscar Matzerath, who, after receiving a tin drum on his third birthday, makes the conscious choice to stop growing and remain a three-year-old for the rest of his life. He hurls himself down a flight of stairs so as to give the adults around him a rational explanation for his handicap, and later discovers that he has the ability to tactically shatter glass with the power of his high-pitch scream, which he evokes whenever anyone attempts to take his tin drum away from him. The film co-stars Angela Winkler as Oscar's mother and Mario Adorf and Daniel Olbrychski as the German and Kashubian (Pole) who may both be his biological fathers. The film mostly takes place from the end of World War I to the end of World War II (when Oscar is 20) in the city of Danzig, Poland. Danzig is most famous for being the site of the first battle of the war at the Polish Post Office, which Oscar takes part in. The film was widely hailed as a masterpiece and shared the Palme d'or at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival with Apocalypse Now, as well as winning the 1979 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. In 1980 Schl\u00f6ndorff collaborated with Stefan Aust, Alexander Kluge and Alexander von Eschwege on the documentary The Candidate, a film about the political campaign of arch-conservative Franz Josef Strauss. Schl\u00f6ndorff next made The Circle of Deceit in 1981. Based on the novel by Nicolas Born, the film concerns the politics and moral struggles of war photographers. The film stars Bruno Ganz and Jerzy Skolimowski as photojournalists covering the Lebanon Civil War in Beirut in 1975. == Hollywood and later career == Schl\u00f6ndorff's first English language film was Swann in Love (1984), an adaptation of the first two volumes of Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time. The film was shot in France and financed by Gaumont, and stars Jeremy Irons, Ornella Muti, Alain Delon and Fanny Ardant. Schl\u00f6ndorff then went to the United States to make a TV adaptation of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman, starring Dustin Hoffman as Willy Loman and John Malkovich as Biff. Both actors won Emmys for their performances and Schl\u00f6ndorff was nominated for an Emmy for his direction. The film premiered on television in 1985 and was released theatrically throughout Europe over the following years. Schl\u00f6ndorff followed this with another TV movie in the US, A Gathering of Old Men, based on the novel of the same name by Ernest J. Gaines. The film stars Richard Widmark, Holly Hunter and Lou Gossett Jr. and concerns racial discrimination in 1970s Louisiana. Schl\u00f6ndorff returned to theatrical films with the Hollywood science fiction film The Handmaid's Tale in 1990. The film's story takes place in a dystopian near future where most women are sterile due to pollution. Kate (Natasha Richardson) is arrested after attempting to flee to Canada and forced to become a \"Handmaid\". Handmaids are fertile women who are enslaved by the state and put in the households of wealthy men - who have \"ceremonial\" sex with them in the hope of conceiving a child. She becomes the Handmaid of the Commander (Robert Duvall), Fred, who is married to Serena Joy (Faye Dunaway). To save herself from execution, Kate - renamed \"Offred,\" since she now is attached to Fred's household - allows the Commander's driver (Aidan Quinn) to impregnate her and falls in love with him. The film was in competition at the 40th Berlin International Film Festival. This was quickly followed by Voyager in 1991. The film stars Sam Shepard as a man who survives a plane crash, then finds the love of his life (Julie Delpy) on his next trip and begins to question the rationale of his good luck after having spent most of his life being cruel to others. The film was based on the novel Homo Faber by Max Frisch and was not a success financially. In 1992 he directed the concert film The Michael Nyman Songbook, then made the first of his two documentaries on famous director Billy Wilder, Billy Wilder, How Did You Do It?, in which he and German critic Hellmut Karasek interviewed Wilder about his career over the course of two weeks in 1988. It was aired on German TV in 1992, and shown on TCM in the USA under the title Billy Wilder Speaks in 2006. Schl\u00f6ndorff had been a great admirer of Wilder for many years and sought his advice during the making of The Tin Drum. Appalled at plans to destroy the historic film studios Babelsberg, Schl\u00f6ndorff mounted a one-man campaign to save them in the early 1990s.Mary Williams Walsh (September 22, 1996), The Savior of Babelsberg (Well, Almost) Los Angeles Times. He served as the chief executive for the UFA studio in Babelsberg between 1992 and 1997. During that time, he helped Jiang Wen finish editing his 1994 film In the Heat of the Sun in Germany, with the studio's full financial support. He also helped to get the film selected for the 51st Venice International Film Festival.Edward Wong (October 16, 2013), Cinema Heavyweights Open German Film Festival New York Times. In 1996 he contributed to the French TV series Lumi\u00e8re sur un massacre with the episode \"Le parfait soldat\". Schl\u00f6ndorff returned to Germany in 1996 to make The Ogre, his most well-regarded feature film since The Tin Drum. Based on a novel by Michel Tournier and starring John Malkovich as the titular Abel Tiffauges, the film revisited many of the themes and time period of The Tin Drum. Tiffauges is a slow-witted French soldier who has been accused of child molestation. After being captured by the Nazis and put in an internment camp, he is made a servant at an elite German training camp and kidnaps local children, officially as a way to recruit them for the camp, but in his mind to protect them. The film was screened in competition at the 1996 Venice Film Festival and won the UNICEF award. The film was released in Germany in 1996 and gained positive reviews. On the audio commentary for The Tin Drum, Schl\u00f6ndorff said that he had wanted to film a sequel to The Tin Drum, as the film was based only on the first two thirds of the novel. But because actor David Bennent was too old to reprise the role and he did not want to recast Oscar, he considers The Ogre to be an unofficial sequel to his masterpiece. Schl\u00f6ndorff returned to Hollywood for Palmetto in 1998. In a classic noir plot, the film stars Woody Harrelson as a falsely accused journalist who was sent to jail after uncovering corruption in the local government. After getting out of jail and unable to find work, he encounters Rhea Malroux (Elisabeth Shue), a femme fatale who propositions him to help her extort money from her millionaire husband. The film was not a financial success and has so far been Schl\u00f6ndorff's last film in the US. Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff and Nina Hoss at the 2017 Berlin International Film Festival Schl\u00f6ndorff returned to Germany to make the 2000 film The Legend of Rita. Loosely based upon the lives of members of the Red Army Faction who exiled to East Germany in the 1970s, the film centers around Rita, who most closely resembles real RAF member Inge Viett. Rita abandons the revolution and lives in East Germany under protection of the secret service, but after German reunification she faces the risk of discovery and consequences for her past crimes.\" Cinema has been 'abused horrifically'\". Matthew Hays and Martin Siberok, The Globe and Mail, Sep. 04, 2000 After the documentary Ein Produzent hat Seele oder er hat keine and a contribution to the omnibus film Ten Minutes Older (both in 2002), Schl\u00f6ndorff made The Ninth Day in 2004. The film is Schl\u00f6ndorff's third film to center around World War II and is based on the diary of Father Jean Bernard. Ulrich Matthes plays Father Henri Kremer, a Catholic priest who is interned at Dachau concentration camp during the Second World War. He is inexplicably released for nine days and sent to Luxembourg. There he meets a young SS soldier who informs him that his mission there is to convince the local bishop to cooperate with the Nazi Party, in which case he will not be sent back to Dachau. He is thus faced with the moral dilemma of betraying his faith or returning to the concentration camp. Schl\u00f6ndorff next completed the TV movie Enigma - Eine uneingestandene Liebe in 2005. In 2006 he returned to the city of Danzig to film Strike, a docudrama about labor strikes at the Gda\u0144sk Shipyard during the Polish 1970 protests. The film is also a history of the Solidarity Movement in Poland leading up to the fall of Communism. Schl\u00f6ndorff's Ulzhan (2007) stars Philippe Torreton as a treasure hunter on his way home who has lost his soul and Ayanat Ksenbai as Ulzhan, the woman who falls in love with him. David Bennent also co-starred. In the summer of 2012, he worked with Andrew Turner, who had formerly been a runway model for the late Alexander McQueen. Schl\u00f6ndorff's World War II-era film Diplomacy, dedicated to his friend Richard C. Holbrooke, debuted at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival. Set in 1944, it explores how the Swedish consul general in Paris, Raoul Nordling, helped persuade Dietrich von Choltitz, the German military governor of Paris, not to obey Hitler's orders to destroy the historic city should it fall into enemy hands.Rachel Donadio (February 9, 2014), Europe\u2019s Painful Past Colors a Film Festival New York Times. ==Personal life== Schl\u00f6ndorff was married to fellow film director Margarethe von Trotta from 1971 to 1991 and helped raise her son from her first marriage.
