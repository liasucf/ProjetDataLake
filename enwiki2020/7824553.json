During the remainder of the Civil War, he continued spying for the Confederacy. He had taken his family to California during the Gold Rush of 1849, and then traveled in the South Pacific. In the 1850s he operated a whaling supply company in Samoa, where he was appointed as Commercial Agent for the United States in the Navigator Islands (now American Samoa) from 1853 to 1856.

C. 19 Mar 1862 after signing an oath of allegiance to the Union.Official Records of the War of the Rebellion, Series 2, vol. 2, Part 1 After release, Van Camp most likely linked up with the Confederate Secret Service. In January 1864, both Van Camps were reported to have been engaging in spying activities for the Confederates in the Vicksburg, Mississippi, area, according to a confidential letter sent to U. S. Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton by a Union sympathizer. They were alleged to be conducting such espionage under the cover of trading in cotton.NARA Military Service Records for Eugene B. Van Camp, NWCTB Image ID: 281274 No arrests were made. In April 1864, Van Camp arranged to secure a trading permit for Eugene to open a store at the Union-controlled Fort Pillow in Kentucky. In an attack by Confederate cavalry under the command of Nathan Bedford Forrest a few days later, Eugene was badly wounded by a Confederate minie ball and was evacuated by Union forces to Illinois and then to New York for treatment.River Run Red.

In January 1865, Van Camp sent a letter to President Abraham Lincoln seeking that Eugene be \"protected from the draft\" which was denied. Eugene was permitted to return with Van Camp to their family home in Washington, D.C. In April 1865, an anonymous letter was sent to Union General Christopher C. Augur, who was investigating the Lincoln assassination, accusing Van Camp, and his son Eugene of being involved in the President's assassination and the attempt on the life of Secretary of State William Seward.The Lincoln Assassination.
