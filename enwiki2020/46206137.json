    "text": "Pigeons being flame-grilled Capucin pigeons The cuisine of Gascony is one of the pillars of French cuisine. Its originality stems from its use of regional products and from an age-old tradition, typical of the Aquitane and the Midi- Pyrenees, of cooking in fat, in particular goose and duck fat, whereas the cuisine of the south of France favours frying in oil and the cuisine of Normandy contains more dishes that are simmered or cooked in butter. The long life expectancy of Gascons, despite a rich diet, is a classic example of the French paradox. ==Main elements== Cooked duck gizzards Landaise salad with duck gizzards, duck fillet and foie gras, asparagus etc. Landes duck breast pan-fried, in the process of cooking The cuisine of Gascony is characterised by the use of regional products such as duck fat and duck foie gras, salted ham, and the famous mild chilli of Gascony. Common condiments are Bezolles mustard, garlic, persillade, and onion. The c\u00e8pe mushroom is frequently eaten; Tricholoma equestre was traditionally eaten but is now considered poisonous after several cases of rhabdomyolysis were linked to its consumption. Larks and the common wood pigeon are commonly eaten game birds; the ortolan, previously commonly eaten, has been a protected species since 1999. Coastal seafood includes oysters, peppery furrowshells, eel elvers, lampreys, and shad. Commonly consumed wine includes clarets (ros\u00e9s) and tannic reds, the most important being Bordeaux wine (cabernets and merlot), but also Madiran wines (tannat and cabernets), the most tannic and well suited to the local food. Dessert wines, ideal with brioche, chestnuts and foie gras, are usually those local to Bordeaux (Sauternes and B\u00e9arn (Juran\u00e7on AOC et Pacherenc). C\u00f4tes de Gascogne and Armagnac are used in cooking, and to flavour tourti\u00e8res.
