He spent his childhood in Elaz\u0131\u011f, eastern Turkey, where he became interested in violin and the Turkish ba\u011flama lute, and started to practice them frequently. He graduated from high school in Elaz\u0131\u011f, then moved to study physics at the Ankara University Faculty of Science from 1970 to 1973. As a result of encouragement to be a scientist by his father, he started to study chemical engineering and in 1974 continued his education in The Ludwig- Maximilians University Munich, Germany, for three years. He was introduced to guitar education in 1973. Instead of being a scientist, he chose to be a musician. Since he needed detailed sounds from a guitar in order to obtain Turkish melodies, he modified his guitar and invented the fretless classical guitar in 1976. In 1980, he returned to Turkey, and started to study at the State Conservatory of Istanbul Technical University. After his military service, he worked as an oud lute teacher. He had live performances with Fikret K\u0131z\u0131lok and B\u00fclent Orta\u00e7gil where he contributed to scene with fretless guitar.

In 1989, he went to the U.S. to work with numerous local blues artists, foremost of which was Robert 'One Man' Johnson. He introduced fretless guitar into blues. A year later, he released his first album in Turkey, Bir \u00d6m\u00fcrl\u00fck Misafir (\"A Lifetime Guest\"), which was ranked 4th in European lists. He still performs concerts through the world and in Turkey. He works with Kemal Eroglu on technical improvements on ba\u011flama lute; and continues his performances with Fahir Atakoglu and B\u00fclent Orta\u00e7gil. In 2004, he played on Yans\u0131malar's album Pervane (\"Moth\").
