It is a lyc\u00e9e specialising in science, economics, literature and arts, particularly known for its courses in cinema and audiovisual, which were the first created in France, in 1983. The lyc\u00e9e Paul-Val\u00e9ry is also known for a sociological documentary following a group of a students, filmed annually for ten years between 1984 and 1993, entitled Que deviendront-ils ?. The Association of former students, teachers and administrative staff of the lyc\u00e9e Paul-Val\u00e9ry (APV) was founded by a group of former students in 2010. Its headquarters are at 38 boulevard Soult, 75012 Paris, its website is at www.apvparis.fr, and it has a Facebook group called \"Alumni Paul Val\u00e9ry Paris\". == History == The lyc\u00e9e was built in two tranches at the beginning of the 1960s, on the site of the former fortifications of the Thiers wall, under the name of annexe du lyc\u00e9e Jean-Baptiste-Say (opened in September 1957), then lyc\u00e9e mixte du boulevard Soult, before getting its current name in 1962 after the writer and poet Paul Val\u00e9ry following a survey of students and suggested by Hellenist Pierre Fortassier. It is the largest school in the 12th arrondissement of Paris both in area ( long on four floors), and number of students. It is one of the lyc\u00e9es built following the post-war baby boom. At the time it was built, the lyc\u00e9e Paul-Val\u00e9ry had the widest catchment area in Paris, from the East of Paris to the current d\u00e9partement of Val-de-Marne. == Architecture == The rear of lyc\u00e9e Paul-Val\u00e9ry from rue du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral-Archinard. The lyc\u00e9e Paul-Val\u00e9ry, designed by architects J.C. Dondel and R. Dhuit resembles a number of other lyc\u00e9es built at the start of the 1960s: a single lyc\u00e9e building with repeating windows along its length, multicoloured windows over the yard, and green and orange mosaics on the building's walls. A giant bronze sculpture, designed by sculptor Robert Couturier (1905-2008), showing a couple holding a baby in their arms was located on the circular grass area at the entrance to the school. This sculpture was controversial amongst a group of students' parents (the man was naked, the woman was not). The administration did not comment on the statues, but after the summer break, the circular bowling green was clear. == Courses == The lyc\u00e9e has around students in its college (450 students), lyc\u00e9e and preparatory classes ( students) and 150 teachers. For around twenty years, the lyc\u00e9e has run numerous artistic courses, particularly based around audiovisual arts, with the creation in 1983 of the first audiovisual cinema section in France. For the past few years, the lyc\u00e9e Paul-Val\u00e9ry has been the only lyc\u00e9e in Paris offering a cinema option for the classes pr\u00e9paratoires aux grandes \u00e9coles, particularly working in collaboration with the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure (Paris).See the Official website of the lyc\u00e9e This option is only available for the hypokh\u00e2gne (the kh\u00e2gne is offered by the lyc\u00e9e H\u00e9l\u00e8ne-Boucher) and since 2010 the kh\u00e2gne offer has been extended with the opening of a Kh\u00e2gne Ulm, with cinema-audiovisual options, modern literature, and history/geography. The lyc\u00e9e has sporting infrastructure in place, and a field covering four hectares. Furthermore, according to the headteacher, with the changes to catchment areas which took place in 2007, the lyc\u00e9e benefits from \"a small rebalancing between schools\" due to the arrival of students from areas which are statistically more privileged and receive higher grades but want to continue their studies, but who have difficulty finding a place.Pol\u00e9mique autour de l'entr\u00e9e dans les lyc\u00e9es d'\u00e9lite \u00e0 Paris in Le Figaro 4 July 2010 From 2011, the lyc\u00e9e is one of three schools in Paris (Louis-le-Grand, Chaptal, Janson-de-Sailly) to offer the first and last years of a science and technology for industry and development course (Stidd).\u00c0 Paris, des classes techno dans de prestigieux lyc\u00e9es in Le Figaro 29 April 2011.

The students from a sixth-form college at lyc\u00e9e Paul- Val\u00e9ry were followed on camera by Michel Fresnel who directed a sociological documentary on the youth who grew up in the 1980s. It followed their day-to- day life, their difficulties, and their hopes. After a three-year break, Que deviendront-ils ? returned for a final two episodes.C\u2019est ce soir la fin provisoire de \u00ab Que deviendront-ils ? \u00bb in L'Humanit\u00e9 30 June 1993 == Alumni == === Notable former students === * Alexandre Adler,Jubil\u00e9 du lyc\u00e9e Paul- Val\u00e9ry in Votre 12e n\u00b043 May\u2013June 2010. journalist and historian. * Martine AubryPaul Val\u00e9ry - Histoires et m\u00e9moire d'une communaut\u00e9 scolaire 1957- 2001, Livre du jubil\u00e9., Minister and Deputy, Mayor of Lille. * Franck Balandier, writer * Catherine Belkhodja, actress, journalist, author/director * Jean Bonnefoy, translator, writer, musician. * Jean-Claude Dauphin, actor. * Sophie Duez, actress. * France Gall,Le Jubil\u00e9 du lyc\u00e9e on the blog Les B de 19, 17 April 2010. musician and singer. * Zeev Gourarier (1953-), museum director. * Maurice Gourdault-Montagne, ambassador and diplomat * Eva Ionesco, actress and director. * Philippe du Janerand, actor and writer. * Christian Louboutin,Eva Ionesco, tomb\u00e9e des nus by Anne Diatkine in Lib\u00e9ration 22 July 2010 shoe designer. * Ma\u00efwenn, actress, director, producer * Sandrine MazetierBiography of Sandrine Mazetier on her official site, politician, Deputy. * Jean Mulatier, cartoonist, caricaturist. * Charlotte Valandrey, actress. * Rama Yade, Secretary of State. * Sma\u00efn, French actress and comedian. === Former notable teachers === * Mich\u00e8le Blumenthal, Mayor of the 12th arrondissement of Paris (2001-2014) * David Assouline * Jean-Marie Zemb * Arthur Giovoni, Professor of literature, resistant, and politician eArthur Giovoni on the site of the Ordre de la Lib\u00e9ration == Access == The lyc\u00e9e is accessible on the lines : *8 Porte-Dor\u00e9e and Michel Bizot *6 Bel-Air *Bus (RATP) *Tram: 3a Montempoivre. == Notes and references == == External links == * Official site of the lyc\u00e9e Paul-Valery Paul-Valery Category:12th arrondissement of Paris ",
