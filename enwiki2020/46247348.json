    "text": "1,2-Diformylhydrazine is the chemical compound with the formula NH(CHO). It is a white, water-soluble solid. A related species is the monoformyl analog, called formic hydrazide (HCONH, ). As verified by X-ray crystallography, it is a planar molecule with N-N, N-C, and C=O distances of 1.38, 1.33 and 1.24 \u00c5, respectively.G. A. Jeffrey, J. R. Ruble, R. K. McMullan, D. J.
