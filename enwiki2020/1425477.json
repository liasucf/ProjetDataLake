He wrote and sang lead on their 1972 #1 hit single \"Brandy (You're a Fine Girl)\" and their 1973 top-forty single \"Jimmy Loves Mary-Anne\". ==Biography== After leaving the band in the mid-1970s, Lurie released a self-titled album and a single, \"Disco (Where You Gonna Go)\", both on Epic Records. Neither reached the Billboard Top 100. He later signed with Arista Records, and also worked writing songs for Chappell Music and Screen Gems Music. In the 1980s, Lurie wrote and produced music for private business use. He moved to Los Angeles in 1984, and in 1985, became head of the music department at 20th Century Fox. That year, he produced the soundtrack album for the John Travolta and Jamie Lee Curtis film Perfect.
