She was a late entry for the Olympics after several athletes chose not to compete and it was a bit of a surprise for her to qualify as she was focused on qualifying for the 2020 Olympics, and she finished 33rd. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Mexican female triathletes Category:Olympic triathletes of Mexico Category:Sportspeople from Guadalajara, Jalisco Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Triathletes at the 2016 Summer Olympics Category:Triathletes at the 2019 Pan American Games Category:Pan American Games medalists in triathlon Category:Pan American Games bronze medalists for Mexico ",
