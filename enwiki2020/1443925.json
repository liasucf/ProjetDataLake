    "text": "The Broadway Bridge is a lift bridge across the Harlem River Ship Canal in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. It connects the neighborhoods of Inwood on Manhattan island and Marble Hill on the mainland. The bridge is named because it carries Broadway, which is also designated as US 9 at this location. The bridge carries the New York City Subway's IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line () above the road. ==History== Before the Harlem River was rerouted, Marble Hill was part of Manhattan island. The bridge in the area was named Kings Bridge, crossing the river on the border between Marble Hill and the Bronx. The Boston Post Road and Albany Post Road crossed this bridge. The Harlem River Ship Canal was completed in 1895 and the old Kings Bridge was demolished. A total of three bridges spanned the canal at this location. === First span === The first Broadway Bridge, opened on January 1, 1895, spanned the canal. The 1895 bridge, a steam-powered swinging bridge, accommodated only highway and pedestrian traffic. When a new span was built in 1905 (see ), the original Broadway Bridge was relocated, becoming the University Heights Bridge between Inwood and University Heights, Bronx. In June 1906, the old bridge was floated down the river and placed on a newly constructed center pier. After all the approaches and other construction were completed, the new University Heights Bridge opened to traffic on January 8, 1908. === Second span === In 1905, a bridge was constructed that could accommodate for the extension of the IRT subway line into the Bronx. The 1905 Broadway Bridge was also a swinging bridge, but a second deck was added to allow for subway traffic on the upper deck, and pedestrian and highway traffic on the lower deck. The last subway train crossed the previous Broadway Bridge on December 23, 1960. Over the next two days (Christmas Eve and Christmas Day), the old bridge was removed and the already assembled new bridge floated and hoisted into position, opening to subway traffic on December 26, 1960. === Current span === The present Broadway Bridge (opened to subway traffic on December 26, 1960 and highway traffic on July 1, 1962) has a navigable channel wide providing of vertical clearance when the bridge is in the open position. In the down position, the bridge provides of vertical clearance. ==Traffic== In 2010, the New York City Department of Transportation, which operates and maintains the bridge, reported an average daily traffic volume in both directions of 37,292. The peak ADT over the Broadway Bridge was 42,555 vehicles in 1990. ==Public transportation== The Broadway Bridge carries the New York City Subway's . Immediately to the north of the bridge along this line is the Marble Hill\u2013225th Street station. The bridge also carries the local bus routes operated by MTA New York City Transit, and the express bus route operated by the MTA Bus Company. ==See also== * * * * ==References== Notes ==External links== *NYCRoads.com: Broadway Bridge Historic Overview ** Original IRT Broadway Bridge *Broadway Bridge Over Harlem River *NYC Bridge Wiki:Broadway Bridge Bike and pedestrian access. * *Replacement of the Broadway Bridge Images; 1961 or 1962 (William Palter) Category:Vertical lift bridges in New York City Category:Bridges completed in 1962 Category:Bridges completed in 1895 Category:U.S. Route 9 Category:Bridges in Manhattan Category:Road bridges in New York City Category:Road-rail bridges in the United States Category:Railroad bridges in New York City Category:Bridges on the United States Numbered Highways Category:Inwood, Manhattan Category:Broadway (Manhattan) Category:Bridges over the Harlem River Category:Pedestrian bridges in New York City ",
