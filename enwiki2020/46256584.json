The novel was made into a 1974 feature-length film of the same name. ==Plot== Sheikh Nuruddin is a respected dervish in an Islamic monastery in eighteenth century Bosnia. He learns his brother Harun has been arrested by the Ottoman authorities but he struggles to determine exactly what happened and what he should do. He narrates the story as a kind of elaborate suicide note \u201cfrom a need stronger than benefit or reason\u201d and regularly misquotes (or misunderstands) the Quran, the sacred scriptures of his faith. Slowly the Sheikh starts to probe and question society, power and life in general. Speaking the truth leads to his being physically assaulted in the streets and even arrested briefly. Ultimately he fights and challenges the injustice of the world by employing deceit which succeeds at the expense of innocent life. Nuruddin replaces the old Kad\u0131 but is in turn corrupted by the need to uphold the original deceit. ===Principal characters=== * Sheikh Ahmed Nuruddin\u2014the protagonist who is a religious everyman. His name Ahmed means friend in Arabic, whilst Nuruddin means \u201clight of the Religion\u201d. * Hasan\u2014Nuruddin\u2019s principal friend outside the tekke. * Mullah Yusuf\u2014the young student Nuruddin has brought into the tekke as an orphan, who spies on him for outside interests. ===Subject Matter=== The principal theme of Death and the Dervish is \u201cmalodu\u0161nost,\u201d a Bosnian word meaning diminished or reduced soul (translates as faint-heartedness, cowardice or indifference). The most popular interpretation of this popular novel is that Selimovi\u0107 employed a fictional Ottoman setting to obscure a real critique of life in Communist Yugoslavia. Another important component is the fact that the story reflects a real-life incident in the author\u2019s own life, when his brother, an ardent Communist functionary, was imprisoned and executed by Communist authorities after the war as an example to others for a very minor offense. ==References== Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina culture Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina literature Category:Novels set in Yugoslavia Category:Historical novels Category:Dervish Category:1966 novels Category:Novels set in the Ottoman Empire Category:Novels adapted into films ",
