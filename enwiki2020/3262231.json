    "text": "Shah Temur (died 1358) was khan of the Chagatai Khanate for a period in 1358. In 1358 \u2018Abdullah, who had recently succeeded Qazaghan to the powerful position of amir of the ulus, executed his father\u2019s puppet khan Bayan Quli and installed Shah Temur in his place. \u2018Abd Allah\u2019s position within the Chagatai ulus was weak, however, and in that same year two tribal leaders, Hajji Beg and Buyan Suldus, drove him from power. They then killed Shah Temur, as Buyan Suldus became amir of the ulus. ==References== *Manz, Beatrice Forbes, The Rise and Rule of Tamerlane.
