    "text": "The 2020 Eden-Monaro by-election was held on 4 July 2020 to elect the next Member of Parliament for the division of Eden-Monaro in the House of Representatives. The by-election was triggered following the resignation of incumbent Labor MP Mike Kelly. Kelly resigned on 30 April 2020, citing ill health. The poll occurred amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and was the first by- election of the 46th Parliament of Australia. On the morning after the by- election, ABC News psephologist Antony Green called the election for the Labor candidate Kristy McBain. ==Background== The electorate of Eden-Monaro has long been regarded as a bellwether seat. From the 1972 federal election to the 2013 federal election, the seat was won by a member of the same political party that also formed government following the election. At the 2016 election, the seat was won by Mike Kelly, who defeated incumbent Liberal MP Peter Hendy. Kelly, a veteran of the Australian Army, had previously represented the electorate in the House of Representatives between 2007 and 2013, and retained his seat at the 2019 election despite a 2% swing against him. At the time, Eden-Monaro was Labor's fourth-most marginal seat, held by a margin of only 0.85%. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Two-party-preferred vote in Eden-Monaro, 1996\u20132019 |- align=right style=\"border-bottom: 2px solid darkgray;\" ! colspan=\"2\"| Election || 1996 || 1998 || 2001 || 2004 || 2007 || 2010 || 2013 || 2016 || 2019 |- align=right | width=1pt | ||Labor || 45.24% || 49.82% || 48.31% || 47.86% || |53.40% || |54.24% || 49.39% || |52.93% || |50.85% |- align=right style=\"border-bottom: 2px solid darkgray;\" | width=1pt | || Liberal || |54.76% || |50.18% || |51.69% || |52.14% || 46.60% || 45.76% || |50.61% || 47.07% || 49.15% |- align=right ! colspan=\"2\"| Government || |LNP || |LNP || |LNP || |LNP || |ALP || |ALP || |LNP || |LNP || |LNP |} Prime Minister and Leader of the Liberal Party Scott Morrison confirmed that the party would contest a by-election in Eden-Monaro were it to occur. Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party Michael McCormack also declared his party would contest the by-election.
