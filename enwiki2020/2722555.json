    "text": "Jacques Lacarri\u00e8re (; 2 December 1925 \u2013 17 September 2005) was a French writer, born in Limoges. He studied moral philosophy, classical literature, and Hindu philosophy and literature. Professionally, he was known as a prominent critic, journalist, and essayist. ==Biography== A passionate admirer of ancient Greece and its mythology, Lacarri\u00e8re wrote about it extensively. His essay L'\u00e9t\u00e9 grec (Greek Summer) was an immense popular success. His classical works Maria of Egypt and Dictionnaire amoureux de la Gr\u00e8ce (Dictionary for one who loves Greece) were also successes. Of interest to ethnographers and ecologists is his Chemin faisant: Mille kilom\u00e8tres \u00e0 pied \u00e0 travers la France (1974, On the way: One thousand kilometers by foot across France). It was based on his walking across France in 1971, when he kept to small roads and byways, stopping at villages. Beginning in August, he traveled from Saverne in the Vosges, reaching Leucate in November, which is located in the Corbi\u00e8res. It was reprinted by Fayard in 1997 with a postscript entitled \"Memory of roads,\" and addition of selected letters from readers. It was released again in 2014, again by Fayard. Lacarri\u00e8re's 1973 literary essay, Les Gnostiques, is well respected for its insights into the early Christian religious movement of Gnosticism. The writer had met English author Lawrence Durrell in 1971, who had been studying some Gnostic texts since the early 1940s. Durrell featured Gnosticism as a plot element in the novels of his The Avignon Quintet (1974 to 1985). He also wrote a \"Foreword\" to the 1974 English translation of Lacarri\u00e8re's essay. He was Correspondent Member of Greek Writers Association \u201cUnifying Process of Authors\". For the whole of his work, in 1991 Lacarri\u00e8re was awarded le Grand Prix de l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise (the Great Prize of the French Academy). He died in Paris on 17 September 2005, following complications from orthopedic surgery. His body was cremated and his ashes scattered in Greece, in the waters off the island of Spetses. == Works == ===In French=== * Les Hommes ivres de Dieu (Men drunk with God), Arthaud 1961, Fayard 1975, (r\u00e9\u00e9d.
