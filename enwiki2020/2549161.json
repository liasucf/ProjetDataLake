    "text": "Scatterville is an unincorporated community in Clay County, Arkansas, United States, approximately 2 mi (3 km) northwest of Rector. All that is left of the community today is a cemetery. The community occupied a strategic location along Crowley's Ridge and was often referred to in the reports of Union and Confederate forces vying for control of Northeast Arkansas during the American Civil War. ==History== Scatterville was one of the first Clay County communities, defined by having five or six families settled in a five-mile (8 km) area.Webb, Robert T., History & Traditions of Clay County, 1933 Scatterville received its name because:Webb, Robert T., History & Traditions of Clay County, 1933 > . . . one man put a store at the foot of a hill, another put one at the > peak, still another put one at the foot on the other side. The few stores > and cabins were scattered about over the hills in a careless way.Webb, > Robert T., History & Traditions of Clay County, 1933 The first families to locate in the Scatterville community were the McNiels, Allens, Copelands, Mobleys, Snowdens, Waddells, Nortens, Mitchells, Golbys, Whites, Bradshaws, Deans, Rayburns, Whitakers, and Simmons. They were mainly subsistence farmers; however, the Allen, Knight, Simmon, Bradshaw, McNiel, and Mobley families brought a few slaves with them when they emigrated from Kentucky and Tennessee. Cotton was grown during the antebellum period, but it was only used to make clothing for personal use. A gin in Scatterville eased this task somewhat by removing the seeds from the boll. After the war, cotton was raised as a cash crop. In 1855, the first horse-powered sawmill was brought to Scatterville, and a frame school building was erected in 1859. In that same year the town welcomed Major Rayburn's new steam-powered sawmill. Other industries in Scatterville included a tanyard for shoe making and a hand-powered sorghum mill.Webb, Robert T., History & Traditions of Clay County, 1933 The community remained stable until the arrival of the St. Louis and Texas Railroad about two miles (3 km) to the south in 1881. The railroad company laid out a new town named Rector, and the population of Scatterville gradually migrated to the new and booming town. ===Civil War=== During the American Civil War, both Union and Confederate forces operated in the area. On March 23, 1862, Union Col. John McNiel reported that \"There are about 1,000 men at Gainesville and Scatterville, on Crowleys Ridge. They are badly armed and scattered, in order to subsist.\"The war of the rebellion: a compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate armies.; Series 1 - Volume 22 (Part II) Page 175, http://dlxs2.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer- idx?c=moawar&cc;=moawar&xc;=1&idno;=waro0033&g;=moagrp&q1;=Scatterville&frm;=frameset&view;=image&seq;=177 On March 24, 1863, Union Col.

The Scatterville Cemetery comprises roughly two acres and is set in an impressive stand of largely oak and hickory trees. The cemetery is surrounded on three sides by a barbed-wire fence of indeterminate age, and is further designated by a large cast-iron marker erected at the entrance by the Arkansas History Commission in 1973. Most of the markers are small, narrow marble slabs, many of which have fallen and/or possibly moved. The inscriptions on many gravestones have been obscured by age and the elements while others were never inscribed. There are a few styled markers, including two four-sided family monuments with obelisks belonging to the Allen and McNiel families. Both were damaged by vandals; the Allen monument has been repaired, while the McNiel obelisk is lying in two parts beside its base. Nearby, the largest gravestone in the cemetery, the square-based, shaft and capital monument to Nancy McNiel, is in worse condition with its shaft lying on the ground and its capital broken into several pieces. There is also a multiple gravestone for three members of the Cook family. It is a tall rectangular monument with an upper-sloped face featuring a sculpted open Bible. Other interesting stones include H. W. Granade's 1870 horizontal cylindrical marker and Captain W. T. Morris's 1902 rectangular monument on base with an open Bible and a knotted stole draped down one side.Dalton, O. L.; \"Scatterville Cemetery Gravestones.\" Clay County Democrat, August 15, 1963. Although there is an unsubstantiated story regarding a grave in the southeast corner in which twenty Civil War soldiers are buried, there is no mention of slaves being buried here. It is known that some are buried at the nearby Mobley family cemetery. The only non-historic component of the cemetery is a dedication marker of pink granite atop a concrete base that is inscribed: > \"The privilege of caring for this forest shrine was accepted by the > Methodist Youth Fellowship of Rector in 1963. We bequeath its perpetual care > to our successors.\"Dalton, O. L.; \"Old Scatterville Cemetery Has Been > Adopted.\" Clay County Democrat, August 8, 1963. ==Bibliography== *Dalton, O.
