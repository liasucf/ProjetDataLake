    "text": "Eric O'Sullivan (born 20 August 1998) is an Irish rugby union player, currently playing for Pro14 and European Rugby Champions Cup side Ulster. He plays as a prop. ==Early life== Born in Dublin, O'Sullivan attended Templeogue College and Trinity College, where he completed a business studies course. O'Sullivan represented his native Leinster at under-17, under-18, under-19 and under-20 level, but missed out on a place in Leinster's academy. Strong performances for Dublin University in the All-Ireland League caught the attention of Ulster and, after an appearance for Ulster's 'A' side in early 2017, O'Sullivan joined the Ulster academy. ==Ulster== O'Sullivan made his senior debut for Ulster off the bench in their 15\u201313 win against Welsh side Scarlets in the opening round of the 2018\u201319 Pro14 on 1 September 2018, and made his first start for the province in their 39\u201339 draw against South African side Cheetahs on 21 September 2018. He signed his first senior contract with Ulster in February 2019, which will see O'Sullivan join the senior squad ahead of the 2019\u201320 season. ==References== ==External links== *Pro14 Profile * *Banbridge RFC Profile Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:Rugby union players from County Dublin Category:Irish rugby union players Category:Dublin University Football Club players Category:Ulster Rugby players Category:Rugby union props ",
