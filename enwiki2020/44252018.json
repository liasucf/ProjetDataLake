Samra is miserable at the haveli so Saarang tries to help her by getting her a secret mobile phone which she can use to contact her mother. Samra finally runs away from the haveli with the help of Saarang. Saarang decides that the only way he can get Samra to safety is if she marries him as Saarang now has power and authority.

Thinking of her son, she agrees to marry Saarang and they do so and face rejection from the family except Amna. Saarang decides to take his mother and Samra with them to live somewhere else but is stopped by Laali Maa who refuses to let Samra leave and taunts her for betraying Fahad.
