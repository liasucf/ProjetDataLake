It is northwest of the city centre, beyond the location of the old Northern Gate (N\u00f8rreport), which, until dismantled in 1856, was near the current N\u00f8rreport station. ==Geography== N\u00f8rrebro has an area of and a population of 71,891. It is bordered by Indre By to the southeast, \u00d8sterbro to the northeast, Bispebjerg to the northwest and Frederiksberg Municipality to the southwest. ==History== Before 1852, N\u00f8rrebro was in the countryside. When the city decided to abandon the demarcation line in 1852, which had previously kept the city within very limited geographical limits, a building boom took place in N\u00f8rrebro. N\u00f8rrebro became the home of thousands of new workers, who came to seek their fortune in the city. ==Culture== N\u00f8rrebro is known for its poly-cultural society. The multiethnic main street N\u00f8rrebrogade runs through the area, with a multitude of shops and restaurants. One of the main points of interest in the area is historic Assistens Cemetery (Assistens Kirkeg\u00e5rd), the final resting place of famous Danes such as S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Niels Bohr and H.C. Andersen. N\u00f8rrebro is inhabited by people from all parts of the world. In 2017, almost one out of six inhabitants had a non-Danish passport, hereof mainly a passport from a European (9.4%) or Asian (3.1%) country. The largest foreigner communities are Swedes (1.0%), Germans (0.9%), Norwegian (0.9%), Brits (0.8%) and Turks (0.7%). ==Riots== Rioters fighting police in N\u00f8rrebro N\u00f8rrebrogade is known as the site of many riots over the years. During the 1980s, it often provided the setting for violent clashes between Danish police and militant squatters known as BZ. The battles were of a very vicious nature, often involving Molotov cocktails and pipe bombs being used by the squatters, as well as batons, tear gas and firearms used by the police. On 18 May 1993, the district was the scene of the N\u00f8rrebro riot following the Danish \"yes\"-vote to the European Union. The police were unprepared for the rioters, who threw paving stones from a nearby construction site. Subsequently, 113 shots were fired: several demonstrators were wounded, some severely. Though none of the protesters died at the time, the fight left 13 demonstrators and 92 policemen injured. The riot was the worst since World War II, but although an official investigation was initiated there is still much doubt as to why the policemen were unprepared or what exactly happened. Following the riot the Danish police upgraded their hand-carried weapons and riot gear to modern standards and began a process towards better strategic and tactical handling of crowds and riots. In late December 2006, a riot took place, regarding the fate of the squatted social centre Ungdomshuset (\"The Youth House\"), a rendez- vous point for the far-left. A demonstration in support of the house was blocked by the police and a fullface streetfight broke out. The demonstrators hurled stones and fireworks at the police, who in response used their armoured cars to disband the demonstrators and fired tear gas in to the crowd. The fight grew into a full-scale riot, with fires burning over night in the streets. Four police and two demonstrators were injured. On March 1, 2007, the biggest riots in recent Danish history broke out when the police moved in and evicted squatters in Ungdomshuset, which was followed by the demolition of the building. It is estimated that the eviction of Ungdomshuset and the damage done during the following riots has cost the city and the state around 100 million danish kroner (around 17 million USD). On September 1, 2007, additional rioting resulted from a protest marking six months after the demolition of Ungdomshuset. ==Notable people== * Viggo Rivad (1922-2016), photographer *Brian Jensen (footballer, born 1975) ==See also== * N\u00f8rrebro station * Bl\u00e5g\u00e5rds Plads * Public art in N\u00f8rrebro * Superkilen - redevelopment project * YNKB ==References== ==External links== * * Photos from around N\u00f8rrebro * Bicycle queues on Queen Louise Bridge from N\u00f8rrebrogade Category:Copenhagen city districts ",
