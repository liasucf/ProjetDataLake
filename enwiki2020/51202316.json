It is a shrub which grows near Wongan Hills and has a single main stem, small leaves and spike- like groups of large, pink, feathery flowers. ==Description== Verticordia wonganensis is a shrub with a single main branch and which usually grows to a height of and up to wide. The leaves are arranged in decussate pairs, elliptic in shape, long and more or less pressed against the stem. The flowers are scented and arranged in spike-like groups near the ends of the branches, each flower on a spreading stalk about long. The floral cup is top-shaped, about long, has 5 ribs and green appendages and is glabrous and slightly rough. The sepals are long, pink and spreading with 7 to 8 hairy lobes. The petals are bright pink, long and erect with a fringe a further long. The style is long, hairy and curved near the tip. Flowering time is from November to December. ==Taxonomy and naming== Verticordia wonganensis was first formally described by Alex George in 1991 from a specimen collected near Wongan Hills and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (wonganensis) is derived from the name of the town, near which the species is found. George placed this species in subgenus Eperephes, section Verticordella along with V. minutiflora and V. fastigiata. ==Distribution and habitat== This verticordia grows in sand in heath and shrubland. It only occurs near Wongan Hills in the Avon Wheatbelt and Geraldton Sandplains biogeographic regions. ==Conservation== Verticordia wonganensis is classified as \"Priority Two\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is poorly known and known from only one or a few locations. ==Use in horticulture== Verticordia wonganensis is usually propagated from cuttings but these are difficult to strike and those that do are difficult to establish in gardens. ==References== wonganensis Category:Endemic flora of Western Australia Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Rosids of Western Australia Category:Plants described in 1991 ",
