Community is an attempt to bring both human and non-human resources together to undertake developmental activities in order to achieve sustainable development. ==Process== Community mobilization is a process through which action is stimulated by a community itself, or by others, that is planned, carried out, and evaluated by a community's individuals, groups, and organizations on a participatory and sustained basis to improve the health, hygiene and education levels so as to enhance the overall standard of living in the community. A group of people have transcended their differences to meet on equal terms in order to facilitate a participatory decision-making process. In other words, it can be viewed as a process which begins a dialogue among members of the community to determine who, what, and how issues are decided, and also to provide an avenue for everyone to participate in decisions that affect their lives. ==Requirements== Community mobilization needs many analytical and supportive resources which are internal (inside the community) and external (outside the community) as well. Resources include: * Leadership * Organizational capacity * Communications channels * Assessments * Problem solving * Resource mobilization * Administrative and operational management == Strategies == The Centre for Disease Control envisions that strong healthcare initiatives will be readily owned by a community if the leaders (\"grass tops\"), the citizens (\"grass roots\"), and youth are fully engaged in mobilizing the community, educating stakeholders, and implementing evidence-based interventions.
