    "text": "Nutukas on display at the Arktikum Science Museum in Rovaniemi, Finland. A S\u00e1mi finnesko, along with a snowshoe, used in Fridtjof Nansen's Greenland expedition of 1890. Nutukas, finnesko, or simply S\u00e1mi boots are traditional S\u00e1mi winter footwear made of reindeer hide. Because they are soft, the nutukas will not freeze as solidly as thick boot leather, making them relatively easy to put on after overnight exposure to subzero temperatures. From 1890, they are regularly mentioned in accounts of polar travel. ==Construction== Nutukas are made from soft hide, traditionally from a reindeer's leg or head, with the fur left on and sewn so that the fur is on the outside of the boot. On the sole the pieces are assembled with cut in the middle so that the fur goes in different directions to improve traction in snow. The shaft of the boot is laced with a wide strap, often highly decorative, that are wound it several rows to keep snow out of the boot. Traditionally, a grass, (such as sennegrass), was used inside the boot to keep the foot dry and warm; now, a felt slipper or valenki is commonly worn instead. The stiff beaked toe of S\u00e1mi boots differentiate nutukas from mukluks and other styles of Arctic footwear. Although the shape of the curved up beak varies regionally, it serves the same purpose of helping to hold firm a traditional binding strap on a pair of skis. The toe helps to keep the boot from sliding back and out of the binding as the ski kicks back. ==Terminology== The word \"nutukas\" is borrowed into English from Finnish, which adapted it from S\u00e1mi languages. In various S\u00e1mi langauges, such boots are called in or g\u00e1llohat; ; or gejhkehke; (pimat'); ; ; ; and , most of which apparently derive from a Proto-Samic *nu(v)ttVkke\u032e. Finnesko is an antiquated word coming from Norwegian. In contemporary Norwegian (both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk), nutukas are referred to as skallar. In Swedish, the boots are referred to as b\u00e4llingsko or \"bell shoes,\" while in Russian they are called \u043f\u0438\u043c\u044b (pima). ==Variations== The style and form of nutukas varies depending on the cultural area and the wearer. Similar footwear is used by other indigenous peoples of the European Arctic, including the Komi, Nenets, Khanty, and Mansi. ==References== Category:Sami clothing Category:Sami culture Category:Sami language terms Category:Norwegian clothing Category:Finnish clothing ",
