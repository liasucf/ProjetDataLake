    "text": "The Zimbabwe cricket team toured the Netherlands in June 2017 to play three List A matches. Some sources stated the matches would be One Day International (ODI) fixtures. However, the Netherlands do not have ODI status, so the matches were List A status only. The fixtures followed Zimbabwe's matches in Scotland. Zimbabwe won the series 2\u20131. At the end of April 2017, the Netherlands announced a 24-man training squad ahead of the tour, which included Shane Snater, who was born in Zimbabwe. He was included in the final squad for the series. In September and October 2017, the Netherlands toured Zimbabwe, also playing three List A matches. ==Squads== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:0 auto\" |- ! ! |- style=\"vertical-align:top\" | * Peter Borren (c) * Wesley Barresi * Logan van Beek * Ben Cooper * Timm van der Gugten * Fred Klaassen * Paul van Meekeren * Roelof van der Merwe * Stephan Myburgh * Max O'Dowd * Michael Rippon * Shane Snater * Tobias Visee * Saqib Zulfiqar * Sikander Zulfiqar | * Graeme Cremer (c) * Ryan Burl * Tendai Chatara * Chamu Chibhabha * Craig Ervine * Hamilton Masakadza * Solomon Mire * Peter Moor * Christopher Mpofu * Tarisai Musakanda * Richard Ngarava * Sikandar Raza * Donald Tiripano * Malcolm Waller * Sean Williams |} ==Fixtures== ===1st match=== ===2nd match=== ===3rd match=== ==References== ==External links== * Series home at ESPN Cricinfo Category:2017 in Dutch cricket Category:2017 in Zimbabwean cricket Category:International cricket competitions in 2017 Category:Zimbabwean cricket tours abroad Category:International cricket tours of the Netherlands ",
