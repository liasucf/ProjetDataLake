In Prague, he became part of a circle of painters that included , and . Although he centered his career there, he made numerous trips to Slovakia to visit his family and hold exhibitions. About this time, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Nevertheless, his work was energized by his opposition to Fascism. By 1942, this was virtually his only theme, as he protested the prison camps, death marches and other evils perpetrated by the Nazi r\u00e9gime. The figure of Don Quixote was a recurring motif of continued resistance, despite overwhelming odds against success. Following the Soviet liberation of Prague in May, 1945, the Um\u011bleck\u00e1 beseda (an artists' association) gave him a certificate of political reliability. At that time, he also married his long-time companion, Karla, and applied for an apartment permit. Not long after, he committed suicide by jumping from a window. It is unknown what the immediate cause may have been, but he had recently suffered from short bouts of depression, related to the increasing difficulty involved in holding and manipulating brushes. A major retrospective was held the following year. In 1991, he was posthumously awarded the Order of Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk by President Vaclav Havel.
