    "text": "The Catalina Verdugo Adobe, also known as the Catalina Adobe, the Verdugo Adobe, and the Teodoro Adobe, is a historic adobe building and a public park located at 2211 Bonita Drive in Glendale, California. The adobe was built on a small portion of the Rancho San Rafael which was granted to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Verdugo in 1784. Jose Maria Verdugo's grandson, Teodoro Verdugo, built the adobe on a small portion of the rancho. Sources disagree as to the date of construction with some sources placing it as early as 1828 and others as late as the 1860s. Some sources indicate that the adobe was built for Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Verdugo's blind daughter, Catalina, who lived there until her death in 1871. Other sources indicate that Catalina lived in the adobe with Teodoro and his family. The adobe was designated as the first entry on the Glendale Register of Historic Resources. It was also registered in 1958 as California Historical Landmark No. 637. In 1976, the adobe along with the nearby \"Oak of Peace\" were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The property is now owned by the City of Glendale and is operated as a historic park.nps.gov, Verdugo Adobe ==Markers== Markers on the site read:#637 \u2013 Catalina Adobe Markers *Marker at entrance: San Rafael Ranch - Jose Maria Verdugo granted land use by Gov.
