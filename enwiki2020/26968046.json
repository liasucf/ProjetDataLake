It is served by low-cost airlines and cargo operators, and is the fifth-largest airport in Sweden, with an ability to handle 2.5 million passengers annually. The airport is located far outside Stockholm Municipality and Stockholm County, but uses 'Stockholm' for marketing purposes. Locally the airport is referred to simply as 'Skavsta'. == History == An airbase during World War II, the airport was used as a military airport until 1980, when it was taken out of service. The council of Nyk\u00f6ping Municipality, where the airport is located, decided in 1984 to take over its control and resume its activities. Civilian passenger air traffic started in September 1984, mainly to Arlanda which at the time had almost all air traffic in Stockholm. In 1998 (after deregulation allowing airlines and airports to compete with each other to a higher degree) the Nyk\u00f6ping municipal council put 90% of the capital of the airport up for sale, with the objective of strengthening its commercial management and enabling investments for its expansion. They acquired this parcel of shares and began the transformation of Skavsta, which has become the second airport of Stockholm and the favoured option for inhabitants who live in the area south of the Swedish capital. The airport has a capacity of 2.5 million passengers per annum and is designed for expansion in the future. It is owned by ADC & HAS, the same company that owns Belfast International Airport, Orlando Sanford International Airport, Daniel Oduber Quir\u00f3s International Airport (Liberia, Costa Rica), Mariscal Sucre International Airport (Quito, Ecuador), and Juan Santamar\u00eda International Airport (San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica). Because the airport is located from Harpsund, the official leisure residence for the Prime Minister of Sweden, to which foreign heads of governments sometimes are invited, Skavsta is sometimes used for flights for a head of government, with associated police escort.H\u00e4r landar Finlands statsminister p\u00e5 Skavsta == Airlines and destinations == The following airlines offer scheduled services to and from Stockholm Skavsta Airport:skavsta.se - Route Map retrieved 19 September 2020 ==Statistics== Check-in hall Apron view {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !
