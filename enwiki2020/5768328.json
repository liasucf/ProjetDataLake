    "text": "The Domino in action The Domino is a loose mortise and tenon joining tool manufactured by the German company Festool. ==History and description== This tool, first on sale in 2007, cuts mortises in the manner of a biscuit joiner. A drill-like rotating cutter cuts a round-ended mortise. Each plunge creates a mortise that is sized to accept a Domino loose tenon, creating joints in stock from wide. There are five cutter sizes (4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm and 10 mm) for six different Domino tenon sizes. Self-referencing pins allow the cutting of rows of evenly spaced mortises with no need to measure and mark. Mortise width is adjustable in three increments with the turn of a knob, and cuts can be overlapped for long mortises. Fence tilts from 0-90\u00b0, with stop positions at 0\u00b0, 22.5\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 67.5\u00b0, 90\u00b0. Exploded Domino joint ==Domino XL== The Domino XL is, as the name implies, the Domino's larger cousin. It uses the same cutter design as the original Domino, yet uses much larger tenons. ==Advantages== *Allows very quick joinery, useful in a commercial carpentry setting. *Flat tenons resists torquing. *Stronger than a biscuit joiner. ==Disadvantages== *High tool cost comparative to other joinery methods *Proprietary tenons (dowels) required *Noise and dust (dust extraction required) ==See also== *Biscuit joiner \u2014 general page on biscuit joinery methods *Dowelmax \u2014 another loose tenon joinery system *Dowels - general Page on Dowels ==References== ==External links== *www.festool.net \u2014 Manufacturer's official international website *festoolusa.com \u2014 the Domino page at the Festool USA site Category:Woodworking hand-held power tools Category:Joinery ",
