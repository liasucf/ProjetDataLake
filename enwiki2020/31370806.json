    "text": "The Fountain of Rua das Taipas () is a fountain in the civil parish of Cedofeita, Santo Ildefonso, S\u00e9, Miragaia, S\u00e3o Nicolau e Vit\u00f3ria, in the municipality of Porto. ==History== The fountain and its niche along Rua das Taipas In 1772, the residents along the Largo do Postigo das Virtudes presented the municipal council with a request to construct a fountain. Although there is no indication when the fountain was constructed or completed, by the end of the 18th century, there was already a need to substitute the pre-existing fountain with another. ==Architecture== The fountain is flanked by buildings along the Rua das Virtudes in the historic centre of Porto. The granite fountain is part of a pyramidal obelisk decorated with a sphere recessed within a deep niche of rounded portico, flanked by pilasters. At the base of the obelisk is a tank and over that a semi-circular dish. On each of these elements (the obelisk and the semi-circular dish) are water spouts. The portico served as a shelter as much as a source of water. Over the entablature is a central column with plinth, surmounted by pinnacle. Much of the fountain is decorated with vegetal elements, but also includes a mirror-like circular element on the obelisk. ==References== ===Notes=== ===Sources=== * * * Fountain Rua Taipas Fountain Rua Taipas ",
