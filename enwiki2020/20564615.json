OUCHARD\u00bb ==Quotes== \"His son, Bernard, ( b.1925 ) became his pupil, and worked with Vidoudez in Geneva before being appointed professor of bow making at the Mirecourt school in 1971, giving rise to the New French School which has produced such luminaries as Benoit Rolland, Jean- Fran\u00e7ois Raffin and St\u00e9phane Thomachot. Most notable of the younger generation include Edwin Cl\u00e9ment, Sylvain Bigot, Gilles Nehr and Yannick LeCanu.\" - Gennady Filimonov Gennady Filimonov \"As playing tools, bows by Emile A. Ouchard are similar to those by Sartory in that they are designed to accommodate the player\u2019s need for weight and strength in a bow. Some in the trade have maintained that bows by E.A. Ouchard are often actually superior in craftsmanship to those by Sartory. There is merit to this argument, but in general Ouchard bows go further in the direction of strength and weight than Sartory bows, and they require even more cushioning intervention to produce the optimal tone quality.\" - Stefan Hersh ==References== * * * * Dictionnaire Universel des Luthiers - Rene Vannes 1951,1972, 1985 (vol.3) * Universal Dictionary of Violin & Bow Makers - William Henley 1970 * Article: The Ouchard dynasty of bow makers Category:1900 births Category:1969 deaths Category:People from Mirecourt Category:Bow makers Category:Luthiers Category:Bowed string instrument makers ",
