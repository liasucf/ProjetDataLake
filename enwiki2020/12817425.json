Prosterman realized that giving poor farmers land rights to the land they were farming would transform the lives of these families, the country, and ultimately the world. It was just an idea. Before he knew it, Prosterman was standing in a rice paddy in the midst of the Vietnam War testing his idea through legislation\u2014the Land to the Tiller program. That legislation gave land rights to one million tenant farmers, allowed them to feed their families, cut Viet Cong recruitment by 80%, and increased rice production in the country by 30%.Prosterman, Roy Land-to-the-Tiller in South Vietnam: The Tables Turn It was also the birth of the Rural Development Institute (RDI), now called Landesa, an international nonprofit organization working to secure land rights for the world's poorest. Today, 50 years after Prosterman stood in the rice paddies of South Vietnam, Landesa has worked in 50 countries throughout the world to secure land rights for more than 400,000,000 people. Prosterman, now Chair Emeritus of Landesa, has helped Landesa grow into a global organization with field offices in China, India, Myanmar, and Tanzania. Landesa is now sought after by foreign governments, foreign aid agencies, and NGOs alike for its insight and expertise on land issues. ==Awards== * 2010 University of Chicago Public Service Award University of Chicago.
