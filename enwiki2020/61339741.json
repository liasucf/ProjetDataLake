Following his 1921 retirement, Lihme began acquiring Flemish tapestries, porcelain and glassware, and notable artworks, including a number of paintings by internationally known artists as Peter Paul Rubens (\"The Portrait of an Old Man\"), Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Van Ceulen, Rembrandt and others. In 1925, Lihme purchased \"Portrait of the Marchesa Lomellini\" for a reported sum of $200,000. The painting was one of seven famous works by Antony van Dyck that had hung for centuries in the Cattaneo Palace in Genoa. In 1927, an elevator operator at his New York residence \"wrecked the interior of his apartment, including many of its art objects, because he thought he was entitled to a bonus.\" ===Residences=== The Lihmes lived in Chicago before moving to New York City where they first lived at 280 Park Avenue, at the corner of 48th Street. Around 1927, the family moved uptown to a triplex apartment at 950 Fifth Avenue, on the northeast corner of 76th Street. 950 Fifth Avenue, which overlooked Central Park, was a fourteen-story building designed by James Edwin Ruthven Carpenter Jr., and completed in January 1927 in the Italian-Renaissance palazzo-style. In 1916, Lihme acquired \"Norman Hall\", the former \"cottage\" of William W. Lawrence (a vice president of the National Lead Company) located at Watch Hill near Newport, Rhode Island. The 10,000-square-foot stone house, later known as Lihme Castle, was completed in 1916, a month before Lawrence's death, and designed by New York architect Mott B. Schmidt and modeled after a French chateau. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Lihme's rented Norman Hall to Charles W. Engelhard Jr., chairman of Engelhard Minerals and Chemicals Inc. In 1965, the Lihmes sold the cottage for $110,000 to the Sisters of St. Joseph of Chamb\u00e9ry as a retreat house. The Lihme family also owned a large oceanfront winter home in Palm Beach, Florida, located at South Ocean Boulevard and County Road and designed by society architect Addison Mizner. ===Descendants=== Through his daughter, Princess Edward Joseph de Lobkowicz, he was the grandfather of three: Prince Edouard de Lobkowicz (1926\u20132010), who married Princess Marie- Fran\u00e7oise of Bourbon-Parma, the eldest daughter of Prince Xavier of Bourbon- Parma and of his wife, Madeleine de Bourbon-Busset; Prince George Christian de Lobkowica (1928\u20131950), who died unmarried at age twenty-one; and Princess Anita Olga de Lobkowicz (b. 1937), who married Count Charles-Louis de Coss\u00e9- Brissac, a son of the Marquis de Coss\u00e9, in the fall of 1958. ==References== ==External links== * Birth Register 1864-1873, Aalborg Budolfi Parish, Denmark * * \"Stone House\" AKA \"Norman Hall\" Watch Hill, Rhode Island Category:1866 births Category:1946 deaths Category:University of Copenhagen alumni Category:American people of Danish descent Category:Heidelberg University alumni Category:People from Aalborg Category:Danish emigrants to the United States ",
