    "text": "The Protocol of Stockholm (also Battle of Stockholm) was treaty between the International Amateur Handball Federation (IAHF) and F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Basketball (FIBB) to transfer the oversight of basketball from the IAHF to the FIBB. ==Prehistory== Basketball was a demonstration sport at the 1904 Summer Olympics. Korfball a similar sport was also a demonstration sport at the 1920 and 1928 Summer Olympics. 1926 a handball commission was found at the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF). This commission was responsible for all ball games which were played by hand. Among other sports, this was basketball and handball. Representatives from 11 countries founded the International Amateur Handball Federation (IAHF) on 4 August 1928 in Amsterdam. All ball games which are played by hand were under the umbrella of the IAHF. Basketball had its own technical commission. At the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles was either sport (basketball and handball) present. Because the IAHF tried to add handball first and the organisation committee didn't want handball because handball was not known in the United States. This default was the reason that Renato William Jones 4 years after the IAHF was found created the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Basketball (FIB) in Geneva on the 18th June 1932. In the same year they tried to become recognized by the IOC but because they had the same abbreviation FIB as the Federation Internationale de Boxe Amateur and the IAHF has to recognize the independence of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Basketball the recognition was declined.\"IOC-Secretary an Maurice Abramovicz\" on 22. September 1932 in Olympic Programm 1928-1982 The IAHF raised an objection on 22. December 1932.\"IAHF an das IOC\" on 22. December 1932 in Correspondence 1932-1960 In early 1934 the FIBB (new name) send a request to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) that the FIBB is responsible for basketball. At the 32nd IOC Sessions in Athens on 18 May 1934 the members of the IOC had positive feedback for the request but they decided to wait until the IAHF congress in Stockholm in September for a decision. ==Negotiation== In 1931 Franz-Paul Lang resigned as president of the IAHF and Karl Ritter von Halt had to manage it as interim president. Therefore the main topic of the IAHF-Cogress in Stockholm in 1934 was to manage the topic of handball. Also handball was first add to the 1936 Summer Olympics so they had to plan the Olympics and basketball was not part of the congress. Secretaries General Renato William Jones and president Giorgio di San Marzano of the FIBB were not invited. Nevertheless they traveled to the congress. Secretaries General of the IAHF Hassler didn't mind their presence. He offered them that basketball would be demonstration sports at the 1936 Summer Olympics and further questions about the FIBA would be discussed by the technical commission (IAHF) next year (1935). After the new election of the council and the technical commission, Karl Ritter von Halt as president and Avery Brundage (President of the United States Olympic Committee) as council member were elected basketball was again at the agenda. It was a strange situation for Brundage because the USA was not part of the FIBB but he has to stand up for the FIBB. The USA would only join the FIBB if the FIBB is recognized in Europe. Von Halt offered the FIBB that members of the FIBB would be part of the basketball commission. Brundage suggested that the FIBB council should have three IAHF and three FIBB members Jones rejected, he wanted an independent federation. Jones said that \"since you are together in Stockholm, the question should be decided immediately and suggests that 2 members from each federation meet after the congress\".\"dass, da man einmal in Stockholm zusammen sei, die Frage sofort entschieden werden sollte und macht den Vorschlag, dass sich 2 Mitglieder von jeder Federation im Anschluss an den Kongress treffen\" in \"Wie das amerikanische Basketballspiel im nationalsozialistischen Deutschland olympisch wurde\" These proposal was accepted. The IAHF named president Karl Ritter von Halt and Tadeusz Kuchar as there representatives and the negotiation was the next day. Secretaries General Hassler had the last change to talk against the recognition of the FIBB. He read out an opinion of France against the FIBB. But he could not stop the process. On 1. September 1934 the delegates of the IAHF (Karl Ritter von Halt and Tadeusz Kuchar) and of the FIBB (Renato William Jones and Giorgio di San Marzano) needed only 20 minutes for the final contract. Observer were Dan J. Ferris (Amateur Athletic Union/USA) and Berthold Leo Werner (Austrian Handball Federation/Austria). Renato William Jones called the negotiation the \"Battle of Stockholm\". ==The Protocol== ==Reactions== On the same day which the protocol was signed Germany, Austria, Egypt, Estonia, Poland and the United States joined the FIBB. Marcel Barille president of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Basketball (FFBB) was consternated that france has not helped with the treaty. But he congratulated gentlemen Jones and di San Marzano. ==Confirmation by the IOC== At the 33rd IOC Sessions in Oslo on 28 February 1935 the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Basketball was recognized as governing body for basketball. ==Literature== * * * * ==References== Category:FIBA Category:History of basketball Category:1934 in handball Category:1934 in basketball Category:Treaties concluded in 1934 Category:Sports treaties Category:1934 in Sweden Category:1930s in Stockholm ",
