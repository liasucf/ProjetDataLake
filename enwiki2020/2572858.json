His elder, paternal half-brother was George Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland. Granville was educated at Dr. Kyle's school at Hammersmith, and then privately by the Revd. John Chappel Woodhouse. He matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, in April 1789 but never took a degree. Nevertheless, ten years later, in 1799, the honorary degree of DCL was conferred upon him.Chamberlain, 2008 ==Career== Granville began his career as a member of the House of Commons, representing Lichfield from 1795 to 1799, and Staffordshire for the next sixteen years. Granville served as British ambassador to Russia (10 August 1804 \u2013 28 November 1805 and 1806\u20131807) and France (1824\u20131828, 1830\u20131835, 1835\u20131841). In 1815 he was raised to the peerage as Viscount Granville of Stone Park in the County of Stafford. In 1833 during his second stint as ambassador to France, he was created Earl Granville and also Baron Leveson of Stone Park in the County of Stafford.Chamberlain, 2008 ==Personal life== A recent historian says that Granville \"was a drab figure, the original stuffed-shirt \u2013 starch outside, sawdust within.\"David Wetzel, A Duel of Giants: Bismarck, Napoleon III, and the Origins of the Franco-Prussian War (2001) p. 217 Lord Granville married Lady Harriet Cavendish (1785\u20131862), daughter of William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire and Lady Georgiana Spencer, in 1809.

For seventeen years she \"loved to idolatry\" this younger man,Lord David Cecil Lord Melbourne Pan Books edition 1965 p. 39 but then, she understood that he must marry in order to further his career and assure his posterity, and so she actively collaborated in the arrangements for his wedding to Harriet (known in the family as \"Harry-O\"), who was understandably reluctant to marry her aunt's lover.Paul Douglass Lady Caroline Lamb New York: Palgrave-MacMillan 2004 p. 87-88 ==References== ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== * * Peerage, * .
