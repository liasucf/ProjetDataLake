Attendees are encouraged to dress in costume befitting a Halloween dance party. The event has five performance stages. The Main Stage is where The String Cheese Incident plays three sets each evening and is then followed by other headlining bands. The Amphitheater has a stage to accommodate additional headliners. The Patch is an additional stage the size of the Amphitheater. Spirit Lake is home to the art installation and a silent disco. The Campground Stage accommodates local, less well-known bands. Each year approximately 100 artists perform. In 2014, Suwannee Hulaween added a day to the festival to become a four-day long festival. If Halloween (October 31) falls on a Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday of that year, Suwannee Hulaween is held during those four days. Otherwise it is held the weekend before. The 2018 festival featured the world's first virtual reality music stage that allowed attendees to interactively explore the relationship between music and sound. Suwannee Hulaween 2019 was confirmed in May 2019 and it headlined The String Cheese Incident, Bassnectar, Anderson Paak and The Free Nationals, and Jason Isbell and The 400 Unit. The festival took place the weekend before Halloween (10/24/19-10/27/19), and the theme was the 1990s. https://musicfestnews.com/2018/08/opinion-why-a-ticket-to-hulaween-is-the- best-value-in-the-festival-universe/ == Line up by year == === 2013 === The 2013 festival was held on October 31 through November 2 and had a voodoo as a theme.
