    "text": "The majority of programming syndicated by iHeartMedia is distributed through its subsidiary, Premiere Networks. However, several iHeartMedia radio shows are syndicated by their local stations without the aid of Premiere. Talk shows of this type are generally broadcast through Orbital Media Networks, Inc. (formerly Clear Channel Satellite Services); music programs of this type are generally prerecorded and distributed through a company intranet service known as Premium Choice. ==Talk shows== The following is a list of radio programs which are syndicated by iHeartMedia but are not distributed by its radio network subsidiary, Premiere Networks. In general, iHeartMedia syndicates a show outside of Premiere either as a cost-cutting measure, or because the show's talent has specifically requested syndication as condition to work for, or continue working for, the company. Talk shows currently syndicated by iHeartMedia are listed in the table below. Talk shows formerly syndicated by iHeartMedia (as Clear Channel Communications) include America's Trucking Network, Kidd Kraddick in the Morning, Lex and Terry, MJ Morning Show, Springer on the Radio, The Schnitt Show, and The War Room with Quinn and Rose. Talk shows syndicated by iHeartMedia that have moved to Premiere include Elvis Duran and the Morning Show and The Bobby Bones Show. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+List of shows syndicated by iHeartMedia outside of Premiere Networks |- !width=\"210\"|Show !width=\"250\"|Host(s) !width=\"180\"|Flagship station !width=\"140\"|iHeartRadio feed |- |Armstrong & Getty |Jack Armstrong, Joe Getty |KSTE/Sacramento |n/a |- |Bronson and Christine |Bob Bronson, Christine Nagy |WLTW/New York |n/a |- |Elliot in the Morning |Elliot Segal |WWDC/Washington, D.C. |n/a |- |The John and Ken Show |John Kobylt, Kenneth Chiampou |KFI/Los Angeles |n/a |- |Murphy, Sam & Jodi |Bob Murphy, Sam North, Jodi Carson |KRVE/Baton Rouge |n/a |- |Valentine in the Morning |Sean Valentine |KBIG/Los Angeles |n/a |- |The Travel Show |Don Shafer, Larry Gelwix |KNRS/Salt Lake City |n/a |- |The Paul and Young Ron Show |Paul Castronovo, Ron Brewer |WBGG-FM/Fort Lauderdale |n/a |- |Mojo in the Morning |Mojo (Tom Carballo) |WKQI/Detroit |Listen Live |- |The Rod Ryan Show |Rod Ryan |KTBZ-FM/Houston |Listen Live |- |Rover's Morning Glory |Rover (Shane French) |WMMS/Cleveland |Listen Live |- |The Dave Ramsey Show |Dave Ramsey |WLAC/Nashville |Listen Live |- |The Schnitt Show |Todd Schnitt |WHNZ/Tampa |Listen Live |- |} ==Music shows== ===NEW!
