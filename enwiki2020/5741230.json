It is managed by the East Bay Regional Park District. ==Description== Officially opened to the public on July 28, 1985, the entire park includes a farm, a large forest and a mansion now called the Patterson House which was first constructed in 1857 by the farm's original owner, George Washington Patterson. Patterson called his estate \"Ardenwood\", after the forested area in England mentioned in Shakespeare's play, As You Like It. There were two subsequent additions to the house. The largest was in 1889 when Patterson and his wife Clara added the Queen Anne Victorian section to the House. The second addition came in 1915 when Patterson's son Henry and his wife remodeled the old farm house section, and added rooms including the kitchen, a large bedroom above the kitchen, the sun porch, nursery, and a bathroom with indoor plumbing.Patterson Ranch - About Patterson Ranch A feature of the park is the Railroad Museum at Ardenwood which operates a narrow gauge railway, a recreation of a historic local branch of the South Pacific Coast Railroad. The museum has a collection of narrow gauge railroad cars and other artifacts of 19th-century railroading. The museum is run by the Society for the Preservation of Carter Railroad Resources.

Among other crops, in the fall the farm harvests a large pumpkin patch. ==Historic area agricultural usage== The Ardenwood Farm today is a working farm producing grain and vegetables. The local area was in agricultural usage beginning sometime in the 1850s.Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, APN 537-521-1-11, Fremont, California, Earth Metrics Inc. report 10302, Nov. 15, 1989 The Ardenwood Farm locale was characterized first for its use as grazing land and dairy production, and gradually became increasingly dedicated to wheat and vegetable production. A review of available aerial photographs by Earth Metrics revealsAerial Photo GS-VACY 1-99, July 12, 1960, United States Geological Survey Photo Library, Washington DC, that the area immediately to the south was used for agricultural purposes from at least 1960 until some time in the late 1970s cultivated with a grain crop. No discrete rows are visible in the aerial photographs of that time. The Alameda family was a prominent occupant in the area for much of the period of agricultural land use. Mel Alameda of The Alameda Company confirmed to Earth Metrics that while cauliflower has been the dominant historic crop for the area, hay and grazing were the primary use later and until the late 1970s. Based on the lack of visible rows on the aerial photos, it is most probable that the area to the south was used for hay production rather than cauliflower. ==Image gallery== File:Ardenwood farm-026.jpg|Stained glass and beveled glass inside the house.
