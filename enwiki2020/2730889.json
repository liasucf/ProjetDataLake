    "text": "The Baker Street Boys is a British television series made by the BBC and first shown in 1983. The series recounts the adventures of a gang of street urchins living in Victorian London who assist the legendary detective Sherlock Holmes in solving crimes and find themselves tackling cases of their own. ==Production== Anthony Read planned out the show's format. Read had previously been a script editor and writer on the 1965 Sherlock Holmes series starring Douglas Wilmer. He claimed to have long wondered what the Irregulars got up to when not in the service of Sherlock Holmes and the series deals with this subject. Although Holmes was always absent (explained on-screen by his being too busy working on another case, being held captive by Professor Moriarty, or confined to bed by illness), Dr. Watson was always around to assist the Irregulars when necessary. Holmes was only ever seen obliquely (Roger Ostime provided the character's voice) while Dr. Watson, Inspector Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson all featured more prominently. ==Cast== ===Starring=== *Jay Simpson as Wiggins *Damion Napier as Beaver *Adam Woodyatt as Shiner *David Garlick as Sparrow *Debbie Norris as Queenie *Suzi Ross as Rosie ===Recurring=== *Roger Ostime as Sherlock Holmes (voice only) *Hubert Rees as Dr. Watson *Stanley Lebor as Inspector Lestrade *Pat Keen as Mrs. Hudson *Colin Jeavons as Professor James Moriarty ==Episodes== Eight episodes were broadcast: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! # !
