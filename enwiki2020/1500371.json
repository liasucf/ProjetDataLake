Dvorna in Dr\u017eavna Tiskarna, p. 24. is a town and the seat of Municipality of Dom\u017eale. The town lies near the foothills of the Kamnik Alps and is crossed by the Kamnik Bistrica River. It includes the hamlets of Zgornje Dom\u017eale (; ), Spodnje Dom\u017eale (; ), and \u0160tuda. Dom\u017eale is known today for its small businesses, agriculture, and light industry. ==Name== Dom\u017eale was attested in written sources circa 1200\u20131230 as Domsselsdorf (and as Vnheilden dorf in 1260, Vnsselsdorf in 1302, Vnsersdorf in 1322, Dumsel in 1490, and Damschale in 1558, among other variations.) The medieval German name Unser(s)dorf is derived from (D)unselsdorf, which was presumably borrowed from the Slovene name and from which the initial D- was lost because it was reanalyzed as a definite article. The Slovene name could be reconstructed as *Dom\u017ea\u013ee, based on a Slavic personal name such as *Domo\u017eal\u044a and referring to an early inhabitant of the place. Alternatively, the Slovene name may be borrowed from Middle High German Domsell(sdorf), based in turn on a Slavic name such as *Domoslav\u044a. In the local dialect, the town is referred to as Dum\u017eale.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo\u0161ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo\u017eba ZRC, pp. 118\u2013119. In the past the German name was Domschale. ==History== Dom\u017eale became a town in 1925 and a city on 19 April 1952. In the following years, Dom\u017eale became an industrial center with strong chemical and textile industry. In 1980, the construction of modern apartments began and Dom\u017eale became known as a bedroom community of Ljubljana. After Slovenia declared independence, on 27 June 1991 the Yugoslav army attacked barricades in the town, and bombed the radio transmitter and houses. ==Church== Assumption Church The church in Dom\u017eale is dedicated to the Assumption of Mary. It is surrounded by a cemetery and stands on a hill just north of the new municipal cemetery. ==Radio transmitter== The Dom\u017eale radio transmitter, the most powerful transmitter in Slovenia, is located near Dom\u017eale. It operates on medium wave frequency 918 kHz and can be received at night throughout Europe. It uses a 161 m guyed steel tube mast as an aerial. ==Sports== *Helios Suns *NK Dom\u017eale ==Notable people== Notable people that were born or lived in Dom\u017eale include: *Ivan Ah\u010din (1897\u20131960), sociologist and journalist *Franc Bernik (1870\u20131948), writer and composer *Danijel Fugger (born 1927), painter *Tine Hribar (born 1941), philosopher and public intellectual *Jo\u017ee Karlov\u0161ek (1900\u20131963), architect and ethnologist *Ven\u010de Ko\u017eelj (1901\u20131968), electrical engineer *Peter Loboda (1894\u20131952), sculptor *Milan Merhar (1910\u20131988), painter *Matija Rode (1879\u20131961), journalist and librarian *Josip Sicherl (1860\u20131935), composer *Matija Tomc (1899\u20131986), composer *Marijan Vojska (born 1934), graphic artist *Breda Zorec (born 1941), storyteller *Radovan Trifunovi\u0107 (born 1973), basketball coach *Dalibor Stevanovi\u0107 (born 1984), football player *Teja Gregorin, biathlon ==Gallery== File:Dom\u017eale - Mena\u010denkova doma\u010dija (Cankarjeva 9).jpg|The Mena\u010denk House ==References== ;Notes ;Sources * Bernik, Franc.
