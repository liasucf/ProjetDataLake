    "text": "Ben Reiter (born June 27, 1987) is an American mixed martial artist currently competing in the Heavyweight division. A professional since 2011, he has competed for Bellator. ==Mixed martial arts career== ===Early career=== Prior to signing with Bellator, Reiter competed mainly in Peru, for the Inka Fighting Championship promotion. He went undefeated, compiling a record of 14\u20130\u20131. The only blemish on his record was a draw with Marcos Rog\u00e9rio de Lima. ===Bellator MMA=== In his promotional debut for Bellator MMA, Reiter defeated Shamir Garcia via unanimous decision at Bellator 124 on September 12, 2014. Reiter defeated veteran Benji Radach, via unanimous decision, at Bellator 137 on May 15, 2015. Reiter was originally scheduled to face A.J. Matthews at the event, but Matthews sustained an injury and was replaced with Radach. Reiter received his first professional loss against Francisco France at Bellator 146 on November 20, 2015, submitting to a rear-naked choke. Reiter/Matthews took place at Bellator 156 on June 17, 2015, which Reiter won via a unanimous decision. Reiter dominated the bout on the ground, almost getting a stoppage due to ground-and-pound towards the end of the third round and even hurting his opponent on the feet at one point. Reiter faced Chris Honeycutt at Bellator 166 on December 2, 2016. Unable to stop Honeycutt's relentless strikes and takedowns, Reiter lost the one-sided fight via unanimous decision. On February 20, 2018 it was announced that Bellator had released Reiter from the promotion. ==Personal life== Reiter is married and resides in Lima, Peru. ==Mixed martial arts record== |- |Loss |align=center|17\u20133\u20131 |Shawn Teed |TKO (punches) |CCFC 79: Sabatini vs. Chaulet | |align=center|3 |align=center|2:27 |Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States |Heavyweight bout; for the vacant Cage Fury FC Heavyweight Championship. |- |Loss |align=center|17\u20132\u20131 |Chris Honeycutt |Decision (unanimous) |Bellator 166 | |align=center|3 |align=center|5:00 |Thackerville, Oklahoma, United States |Catchweight (195 lbs) bout. |- |Win |align=center|17\u20131\u20131 |A.J.
