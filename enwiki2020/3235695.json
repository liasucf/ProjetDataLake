    "text": "{| |} The Type 148 Tiger-class fast attack craft is a modification of the French design for the German Navy. == Design == The La Combattante IIas had been designed by L\u00fcrssen of Germany for Israel, but were built in France by Constructions M\u00e9caniques de Normandie in Cherbourg (CMN) for political reasons. Eight of the boats were laid down by CMH, but completed by L\u00fcrssen. == Operational history == The boats were commissioned into the Bundesmarine in the mid-1970s, replacing the Jaguar-class vessels of the 3rd and 5th Squadrons. At first the boats did not receive names, only numbers, but these were introduced later at the insistence of the crews. The ships served for 30 years, and received major updates in 1982\u201384 and 1990\u201392. After decommissioning they were scrapped or sold to different countries. No direct replacements were procured as due to the changed operating conditions the Deutsche Marine has reduced the number of these fast attack boats drastically and procured instead a smaller number of corvettes. ==Ship list== {|class=\"wikitable\" !Pennant number !Name !Call sign !Shipyard !Laid down !Launched !Commissioned !Decommissioned !Status |- |P6141||S41 Tiger||DRBA||CMN||11 October 1971||27 September 1972 |30 October 1972||24 September 1998|| sold to the Chilean Navy as Teniente Uribe (LM-39); decommissioned 2014. |- |P6142||S42 Iltis||DRBB||CMN||2 February 1972||12 December 1972 |8 January 1973||15 October 1992|| sold to the Hellenic Navy |- |P6143||S43 Luchs||DRBC||CMN||23 March 1972||7 March 1973 |9 April 1973||27 August 1998|| sold to the Chilean Navy for scrapping |- |P6144||S44 Marder||DRBD||CMN||15 April 1972||5 May 1973 |14 July 1973||25 May 1994|| sold to the Hellenic Navy |- |P6145||S45 Leopard||DRBE||CMN||13 September 1972||3 July 1973 |21 August 1973||28 September 2000|| sold to the Hellenic Navy |- |P6146||S46 Fuchs||DRBF||L\u00fcrssen||10 March 1972||21 May 1973 |17 October 1973||19 December 2002|| Sold to the Egyptian Navy |- |P6147||S47 Jaguar||DRBG||CMN||29 November 1972||20 September 1973 |13 November 1973||28 September 2000|| sold to the Hellenic Navy |- |P6148||S48 L\u00f6we||DRBH||L\u00fcrssen||10 July 1972||10 September 1973 |9 January 1974||19 December 2002|| sold to the Egyptian Navy |- |P6149||S49 Wolf||DRBI||CMN||23 January 1973 ||11 January 1974 |26 February 1974||27 August 1997|| sold to the Chilean Navy in 1997 as Guardiamarina Riquelme (LM-36); decommissioned 2004. |- |P6150||S50 Panther||DRBJ||L\u00fcrssen||30 September 1972||10 December 1973 |27 March 1974||29 September 2002|| scrapped 2003 |- |P6151||S51 H\u00e4her||DRBK||CMN||5 April 1973 ||26 April 1974 |12 June 1974||23 June 1994|| sold to the Hellenic Navy |- |P6152||S52 Storch||DRBL||L\u00fcrssen||12 March 1973||25 March 1974 |17 July 1974||12 November 1992|| sold to the Hellenic Navy |- |P6153||S53 Pelikan||DRBM||CMN||11 September 1973||4 July 1974 |24 September 1974||25 June 1998|| sold to the Chilean Navy for scrapping. |- |P6154||S54 Elster||DRBN||L\u00fcrssen||29 June 1973 || 8 July 1974 |14 November 1974||27 August 1997|| sold to the Chilean Navy in 1997 as Teniente Orella (LM-37); decommissioned 2014. |- |P6155||S55 Alk||DRBO||CMN||9 April 1974||15 November 1974 |7 January 1975||13 May 2002|| sold to the Egyptian Navy |- |P6156||S56 Dommel||DRBP||L\u00fcrssen||13 December 1973||30 October 1974 |12 February 1975||19 December 2002|| sold to the Egyptian Navy |- |P6157||S57 Weihe||DRBQ||CMN||2 July 1974||13 February 1975 |3 April 1975||19 December 2002|| sold to the Egyptian Navy |- |P6158||S58 Pinguin||DRBR|| L\u00fcrssen ||11 March 1974||26 February 1975 |22 May 1975||28 June 2002|| scrapped 2003 |- |P6159||S59 Reiher||DRBS||CMN||8 November 1974||15 May 1975 |24 June 1975||27 September 2002|| scrapped 2003 |- |P6160||S60 Kranich||DRBT||L\u00fcrssen||9 May 1974||26 May 1975 |6 August 1975||24 September 1998|| sold to the Chilean Navy in 1998 as Teniente Serrano (LM-38); decommissioned 2014. |} == See also == * La Combattante class fast attack craft == References == === Notes === === Bibliography === * == External links == * Schnellboote TIGER-Klase \u2013 Marine (Official homepage of the German Navy) * Warships on the Web * S46 Fuchs * S51 H\u00e4her * S58 Pinguin Category:Missile boat classes Category:Missile boats of Germany Category:Missile boats of the German Navy ",
