    "text": "Lavar Munroe (b. Nassau, Bahamas 1982) is an interdisciplinary artist whose work encompasses painting, drawing, sculpture, installation art, and a hybrid medium that straddle the line between sculpture and painting. Munroe lives and works in the United States. ==Background== Munroe was born in Nassau, Bahamas where he resided in the community of Grants Townhttp://arcthemagazine.com/arc/2014/06/jack-bell-gallery-presents-grants- town-trickster/http://www.jackbellgallery.com/exhibitions/42/ until 2004. He grew up challenged with a lot of stigmas and stereotypes that were associated with the community that he lived in. Much of Munroe's understanding of such societal disparities was informed by his upbringing. This is evident in the disturbing, yet gorgeous and powerful works he creates. He relocated to the United States in 2004 to pursue tertiary level education. He has resided in the United States ever since. ==Early life and career== In 2007, he received his Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Savannah College of Art and Design. He obtained a Master of Fine Arts degree from Washington University in St. Louis in 2013.

Munroe lives and works between Washington, DC and Nassau, Bahamas. ==Works== Munroe employs a variety of mediums and is best known for his genius play on anthropology in relation to mythology. One of Munroes better known series of works titled \"Where Heroes Lay\" engaged a material exchange between the artist and a homeless person in downtown Washington DC. Munroe took on the role of a maid as he periodically removed soiled cardboard pieces from the homeless' sleeping quarters. As he removed dirty material, he replaced it with clean cardboard. By becoming a servant, Munroe's intention was to inconspicuously induct the disadvantage person as a Hero. Reeking of alcohol, cigarettes, piss, shit, and body odor, the work was presented as a suite of nine individual beds.http://lavar-munroe.com/artwork/3303574.html Munroe's intention was also trickery as he presented The Hero\u2019s soiled bedding material as a consumer good in the art-market, knowing that the objects would serve as weapons of critique and ridicule towards mainstream society.http://www.artfilemagazine.com/article/transformation.phphttp://beautifulsavage.com/design/profile- lavar-munroe/\" Also of great significants are Munroe's monumental paintings and his intricately rendered works on paper. Such works explore his ongoing interest in the phenomena of the \u201chuman zoo\u201d in place during colonial times, and its impact on the politics of representation in the present. Munroe equates these works to his entry into the American school system at age 21, where words such as exotic, islander and native became the norm when many Americans referred to him. These words were usually followed by bizarre questions regarding the way of life on the \u201cislands\u201d, which usually pointed to ideals that referenced behaviors of the savage. Though Munroe realized that the questions were more than likely said out of naivety and innocence, he began the task of trying to figure out the origins of such stereotypes in order to question certain prejudices associated with non-Western civilizations today. Munroe\u2019s painting practice incorporates elements of assemblage and collage, with composite pieces stitched and glued into a larger whole. Anthropomorphic figures that vacillate between the playful and macabre are the central motifs of his large-scale canvases. Often incorporating found and discarded materials, Munroe creates rich, painterly works that foreground his interest in history, anthropology and sociology.https://www.scad.edu/event/2016-02-04-lavar-munroe-exhibition-scad- museum-art-savannah ==External links== * Lavar Munroe Studio * * Lavar Munroe at Jack Bell Gallery ==References== Category:1982 births Category:People from Nassau, Bahamas Category:Bahamian artists Category:Living people Category:Interdisciplinary artists Category:Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts alumni Category:Savannah College of Art and Design alumni Category:Contemporary painters ",
