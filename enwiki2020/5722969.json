    "text": "4 Ruedas (4 Wheels) is a Mexican automotive enthusiast magazine created in September 1994. Motor y Volante, published by Editorial Novaro, was the first Mexican car magazine with publication dating back to 1983. 4 Ruedas joined Car and Driver Mexico and Autom\u00f3vil Panamericano in the mid-1990s. Despite not being the most successful 4 Ruedas was first published in a time when car marketing in Mexico was very poor, with only 17 car makers present in the country (now there are 41). 4 Ruedas is published monthly by editorial Grupo Notmusa. The headquarters is in Mexico City. The magazine has been divided into these sections since its creation: *Mundo Sobre Ruedas (News) *Pruebas (Tests) *AutoNuevo (Prices of new cars) *AutoUsado (Prices of used cars) *AutoDeporte (Sport news) *S\u00f3lo Una M\u00e1s (Curious pictures) Other sections were added later: *AutoColecci\u00f3n (Article about a special car and a double-face poster) *AutoAccesorios (Car accessories page) *Fracci\u00f3nDeSegundo (Article about a watch) The magazine publishes every year the \"Modelos ####\" (e.g. Modelos 2007, published in October 2006). It is an article that shows the new car models that will arrive in Mexico within the next year. ==Editorial direction== The only editorial director of this magazine has been Alejandro Guilbert P. since 1994; he now is director for the Mexican car magazine Todo de Autos. ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:1994 establishments in Mexico Category:Automobile magazines Category:Magazines established in 1994 Category:Mass media in Mexico City Category:Magazines published in Mexico Category:Monthly magazines published in Mexico Category:Spanish-language magazines ",
