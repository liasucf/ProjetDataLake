In 1961, he immigrated to the United States and studied directing at the Yale School of Drama. ==Career== After directing stage plays and teaching drama in the 1960s and 1970s, he received his first opportunity directing television in 1976 with an episode of Rhoda titled \"Rhoda Questions Her Life and Flies to Paris\". Since then, he has directed episodes of many well-known sitcoms, including Benson, WKRP in Cincinnati, The Facts of Life, Family Ties and Who's the Boss?, for which he directed 117 episodes and also produced 51. In an interview, Kelada said that good casting is essential to the success of a comedy, because \"you cannot make the actor be funny\". He also said that where drama is \"analytical,\" comedy is \"much more technical. It's about rhythm, timing, pace and energy.\"MAGAZINE | FEATURES | Directing Comedy 101 | VOL 28-2: July 2003 ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:90%;\" ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | TV series ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Notes |- |1976 |Phyllis |Directed 2 episodes |- |1976\u20131978 |Rhoda |Directed 7 episodes |- |rowspan=2|1977 |Busting Loose |Directed 1 episode |- |We've Got Each Other |Directed 1 episode |- |1977\u20131978 |The Tony Randall Show |Directed 5 episodes |- |1978 |Baby, I'm Back |Directed 1 episode |- |1978\u20131982 |WKRP in Cincinnati |Directed 15 episodes |- |1979\u20131980 |The Last Resort |Directed 15 episodes |- |1980 |Benson |Directed 2 episodes |- |1980\u20131985 |The Facts of Life |Directed 77 episodes |- |rowspan=3|1981 |One Day at a Time |Directed 1 episode |- |The Two of Us |Directed 4 episodes |- |Park Place |Directed 1 episode |- |rowspan=2|1982 |Report to Murphy |Directed 1 episode |- |The Facts of Life Goes to Paris |Director, Television movie |- |1982\u20131988 |Family Ties |Directed 8 episodes |- |1984 |Night Court |Directed 2 episodes |- |1984\u20131990 |Who's the Boss? |Directed 117 episodes, producer, 51 episodes |- |1985 |No Complaints! |Directed 1 episode, executive producer |- |rowspan=2|1986 |Valerie |Directed 5 episodes |- |Charmed Lives |Directed 1 episode |- |1987 |Karen's Song |Directed 3 episodes |- |1988 |Frank's Place |Directed 1 episode |- |1988\u20131989 |Day by Day |Directed 2 episodes |- |1989 |The Ed Begley Jr. Show |Directed 1 episode |- |1990 |Married People |Directed 12 episodes |- |rowspan=2|1991 |Designing Women |Directed 1 episode |- |The New WKRP in Cincinnati |Directed 1 episode |- |1992 |Frannie's Turn |Directed 4 episodes |- |1993\u20131994 |George |Directed 9 episodes |- |1995\u20131996 |In the House |Directed 12 episodes |- |1996 |The Louie Show |Directed 3 episodes |- |1996\u20131997 |Sister, Sister |Directed 16 episodes |- |1999\u20132002 |Dharma & Greg |Directed 14 episodes |- |2000 |The Michael Richards Show |Directed 4 episodes |- |2000\u20132001 |Everybody Loves Raymond |Directed 2 episodes |- |2003 |Sabrina the Teenage Witch |Directed 2 episodes |- |rowspan=2|2004 |Good Morning, Miami |Directed 1 episode |- |Still Standing |Directed 1 episode |- |2005 |Two and a Half Men |Directed 2 episodes |- |2006 |Courting Alex |Directed 3 episodes |- |2008 |Happy Hour |Directed 1 episode |- |rowspan=2|2009 |The Office |Directed 1 episode |- |Ruby & The Rockits |Directed 2 episodes |- |2016 |My America |Directed 2 episodes (TV series short) |} ==See also== * List of Copts * Lists of Egyptians ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Egyptian emigrants to the United States Category:The American University in Cairo alumni Category:Yale School of Drama alumni Category:American television directors Category:Egyptian people of Coptic descent Category:American people of Coptic descent Category:Living people Category:1942 births Category:People from Cairo ",
