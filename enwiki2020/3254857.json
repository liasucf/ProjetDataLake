    "text": "La Conquista del Estado (English: \"The Conquest of the State\") was a magazine based in Madrid, Spain. ==History and profile== La Conquista del Estado was launched in 1931 by Ramiro Ledesma Ramos. The first issue, issued on 14 March 1931, contained a manifesto in which National Syndicalism was elaborated. Ledesma's idea was to win over the Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT), the then dominant trade union movement in the country, to a form of national corporatism. The ideas in the essay were discussed during the CNT congress in the summer of 1931 without being approved. On the other hand, despite the magazine being inspired from the views of Adolf Hitler, the founders of the magazine did not endorse his views on racism and argued that it should be replaced with the notion of Spain's imperial past. Members of the organizing committee of La Conquista del Estado were Ramiro Ledesma Ramos (president), Juan Aparicio L\u00f3pez (secretary), Ernesto Gim\u00e9nez Caballero, Ricardo de Jaspe Santoma, Manuel Souto Vilas, Antonio Berm\u00fadez Ca\u00f1ete, Francisco Mateos Gonz\u00e1lez, Alejandro M. Raim\u00fandez, Ram\u00f3n Iglesias Parga, Antonio Ria\u00f1o Lanzarote and Roberto Escribano Ortega. The small group around La Conquista del Estado was based in the universities of Madrid. On 10 October the group around La Conquista del Estado merged with the Valladolid-based Junta Castellana de Actuaci\u00f3n Hisp\u00e1nica to form the Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional- Sindicalista. In total 23 issues of La Conquista del Estado were published during 1931. Generally the publication was weekly, but was suspended during August and September. The last issue was published on 24 October. ==See also== * List of magazines in Spain ==References== ==External links== * La Conquista del Estado archive Category:1931 establishments in Spain Category:1931 disestablishments in Spain Category:Defunct magazines published in Spain Category:Fascist newspapers and magazines Category:Magazines established in 1931 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1931 Category:Spanish-language magazines Category:Weekly magazines published in Spain Category:National syndicalism Category:Magazines published in Madrid ",
