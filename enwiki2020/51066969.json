It served as the place where the Mughal emperor received courtiers and state guests. In contrast to the Diwan-i-Aam, the Diwan-i-Khas served as a hall where the Emperor would attend to matters of the state. The hall was the site of elaborate pageantry, with processions of up to one hour long occurring before each audience session. ==Gallery== File:Diwan- i-Khas, Lahore, Interior.jpg|Interior, March 2016. ==See also== *Diwan-i-Khas (Red Fort), Delhi ==References== ==External links== Category:Lahore Fort ",
