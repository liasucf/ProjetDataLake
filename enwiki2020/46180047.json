Stack is interested in exploring \"language and its limits\" and epicting moments in human life through her art. Her work is collected by the Beaux Art Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Dallas Museum of Art, the San Antonio Museum of Art, the El Paso Museum of Art, the Blanton Museum of Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego. == References == == External links == * Faculty page Category:1941 births Category:University of Houston faculty Category:University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign alumni Category:Southern Illinois University Carbondale alumni Category:American women artists Category:American feminists Category:Living people ",
