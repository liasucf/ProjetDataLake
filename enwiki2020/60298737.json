Golson and Fuller both sound very much in their musical prime. The tenor's sound at this point had become quite a bit harder than previously, at times fairly close to Archie Shepp's, but he swung as hard as ever. Fuller in contrast is unchanged from his earlier days. Together they play in top form\". == Track listing == All compositions by Benny Golson except where noted # \"My Blues House\" \u2013 8:41 # \"Domingo\" \u2013 7:57 # \"In Your Own Sweet Way\" (Dave Brubeck) \u2013 9:34 # \"Thinking Mode\" \u2013 9:27 # \"Moment to Moment\" \u2013 6:48 # \"Time Speaks\" \u2013 9:20 # \"A La Mode\" (Curtis Fuller) \u2013 9:02 # \"Blues March\" \u2013 4:09 == Personnel == *Benny Golson \u2013 tenor saxophone *Curtis Fuller \u2013 trombone *Kevin Hays \u2013 piano *James Genus - bass *Tony Reedus \u2013 drums *Jean-Loup Longnon \u2013 trumpet (track 8) == References == Category:Benny Golson albums Category:1992 albums Category:Dreyfus Records albums ",
