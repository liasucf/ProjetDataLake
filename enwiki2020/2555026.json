It has been a municipality until 1 January 2009 when it fused with Sandav\u00e1gur into V\u00e1ga kommuna. Located on the south coast of the island of V\u00e1gar, Mi\u00f0v\u00e1gur is the largest town on this Faroese island. For years, Mi\u00f0v\u00e1gur has been known as a good location for whaling and traditionally, bells would ring with the cry \"Grindabo\u00f0!\" - \"Pilot whale ahoy!\" ==History== Mi\u00f0v\u00e1gur has been inhabited since at least the Viking period\u2014as excavations have demonstrated. Since these early times, there has been a local \"Thingst\u00e4tte\" (local community council), or \"V\u00e1rting\". The most interesting building of the village is K\u00e1lval\u00ed\u00f0, a house which was probably built at the end of the Middle Ages. It is the oldest building of the village and possibly of the whole Faroe Islands. K\u00e1lval\u00ed\u00f0 consists of two rooms with a turf roof, built in the traditional faroese style. Today it houses a museum. ==Sports== The local football team is MB (Mi\u00f0v\u00e1gs B\u00f3ltfelag), founded in January 1905. The rowing club from Mi\u00f0v\u00e1gur is Mi\u00f0v\u00e1gs R\u00f3\u00f0rarfelag. == People of note from Mi\u00f0v\u00e1gur == K\u00e1lval\u00ed\u00f0 House *Greta Svabo Bech, Faroese singer *Beinta Broberg (1667\u20131752), a pastor's wife, and believed to be the model for the main character of Barbara, the best-known Faroese novel (written in Danish). *Pauli Ellefsen (1936-2012), Former Prime Minister (1981-1985) *Sverri Sandberg Nielsen, (born 1993) a Faroese rower *Rasmus Rasmussen (1871\u20131962), writer *Jens Christian Svabo (1746\u20131824), a pastor's son, who contributed greatly to the modern concept of a Faroese written language, working to standardize grammar and spelling and created a Faroese dictionary.
