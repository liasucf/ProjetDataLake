    "text": "XLR-V The Cadillac V series is a line of high-performance vehicles tuned by the General Motors Performance Division for the Cadillac division of General Motors. Models in the V series include the CTS-V coupe, sedan and wagon. Cadillac reportedly has no plans to create V-series versions of its crossovers, the , XT4, XT5 and XT6. However, multiple reports have stated that Cadillac's largest SUV, the Escalade, may receive a \"V\" variant for the new fifth generation, due in 2021. Second-generation Cadillac CTS-V Sedan Most V-series Cadillacs feature high-performance V8 engines mated to manual six- speed transmissions or automatic transmissions in the STS-V, XLR-V ATS-V and 2009+CTS-V, top-of-the-line Brembo brakes and revised suspension systems, revised interiors and special V-series bodywork which is intended to improve vehicle performance as well as differentiate them from their normal production counterparts. Cadillac has also re-entered Motorsport competition with their CTS-V R, a joint venture between GM Performance Division and Pratt & Miller race team, most famous for their role in GM's Le Mans-winning Corvette C5-R program. In addition to the Corvette and Camaro, the V designation draws comparisons to other high-performance models by GM such as the Super Sport series, Chrysler's SRT, and Ford SVT line of high-performance vehicles. In 2009, the second-generation CTS-V sedan achieved a lap time of 7:59.32 at the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife, which was the fastest documented time for a production sedan on factory tires\u2014until the Porsche Panamera Turbo clocked a time of 7:56 in July 2009\u2014thanks to a heavily-tuned \"LS9\" EATON-supercharged V8 engine that was borrowed from Corvette. The engine was renamed as \"LSA\" and it produces 556 horsepower as well of torque. The same \"LSA\" engine is used in CTS-V coupe and wagon. The CTS-V is the only V-series Cadillac for the 2014 model lineup, and it was originally created to compete with BMW M3 sedan and coupe, as well the M5. Future plans for the V series include a new ATS-V sedanATS-V sedan and coupecoupe along with a third-generation CTS-V sedan.3rd generation CTS-V sedan ==First-generation V series== First-generation Cadillac CTS-V The first V-series model of the Cadillac family was the CTS, which was built on GM Sigma Platform like the core model. Since a V8 engine was used, it required a unique engine cradle distinct from the base CTS V6. Larger anti- roll bars and larger shocks were also added. The spring rate was significantly increased. Right at front above the ground, GM LS engine V8 from the C5-generation Corvette Z06 was fitted and coupled\u2014also from the C5 Z06\u2014with a six-speed Tremec manual transmission. Cadillac XLR-V XLR hard-top was the second Cadillac to join the V series. It was an ultra-luxury segment car, first introduced in 2005 and it shared platform with Chevrolet Corvette (C6). The XLR-V used a supercharged Northstar engine series. For the XLR-V, the engine was certified by the SAE to produce 443 hp (330 kW) and 414 lb\u00b7ft (561 N\u00b7m). The supercharger and four intercoolers were built into the intake manifold. A six-speed automatic transmission, larger brakes from the Z51 Corvette, and 19-inch wheels were used. The XLR base price was $98,000 and by 2008 it reached $101,300 making it one of General Motors' most expensive vehicles of all time. Cadillac STS-V A year after XLR-V launch and two after CTS-V, in 2006, Cadillac started producing STS-V sedan that also featured the famous Northstar V8 engine from XLR-V. However, the supercharged Northstar V8 in STS-V had 26 more horsepower and 25 more lb-ft of torque than XLR-V's. The engine was mated to a driver-adjustable transmission with two shifting modes, larger brakes by Brembo, larger ten-spoke alloy wheels (18 in \u00d7 8.5\" front, 19 in \u00d7 9.5\" rear), Pirelli run-flat tires, a faster steering ratio, and a stiffer suspension than the standard STS. ==Second-generation V series== 2nd generation Cadillac CTS-V sedan The second-generation V series was exclusive to the CTS since STS and XLR were rolled out of production. For 2009, Cadillac introduced the second-generation CTS-V that was built on GM Sigma II Platform. It was a rear-wheel drive, powered by a LSA EATON-supercharged V8 that was based on LS9 V8 from\u2014what was then\u2014recently released Corvette ZR1. The engine generates 556 horsepower and 551 lb-ft of torque. The second-generation CTS-V was a major hit that advanced Cadillac's \"Art & Science\" philosophy further ahead. It broke a N\u00fcrburgring lap-record which made it\u2014back then\u2014the fastest production sedan. Second-generation Cadillac CTS-V wagon When asked in 2009 about the possibility of a CTS-V wagon, the GM Vice Chairman at that time, Bob Lutz, replied, \"... should sufficient demand materialize, there is no reason why we couldn't do a V-series wagon, and I would be standing in line for one, just ahead of you.\" GM decided to move forward, introducing a 5-door sport wagon body style to the CTS-V vehicle line at the New York International Auto Show on March 29, 2010. The CTS-V wagon shares the 556 hp (415 kW) engine and six-speed manual or automatic transmission, Magnetic Ride Control, Brembo brakes, 19-inch aluminum wheels and performance tires and a dual-airflow grille also used in the CTS-V sedan and coupe. The CTS-V coupe debuted at the 2010 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, and entered production in summer 2010 as a 2011 model. It has the same 556 hp (415 kW) engine and transmission choices as the CTS-V sedan. The CTS-V Coupe features unique centered twin exhausts, a larger grille for air intake, and an optional \"saffron\" interior trim color. Like the CTS-V sedan, it comes standard with 19-inch aluminum wheels, Brembo brakes, and Magnetic Ride Control. ==Third- generation V series== Third generation Cadillac CTS-V Cadillac ATS-V The third generation CTS-V includes a 6.2 litre 640 hp LT4 supercharged gasoline V8 engine, as the most powerful Cadillac ever produced to date. The third generation CTS-V is sometimes referred to as a four-door Corvette, because of its supercharged V8 from the Corvette C7 Z06 and a top speed of 200 miles per hour. It weighs 4145 pounds. The new 2016 Cadillac CTS-V model equipped with an 8-speed automatic transmission has been street tested with a best 0-60 MPH test time of 3.6 seconds.[20] ===Vsport=== Starting with XTS, the marque offers a step trim, called Vsport. The Vsport trim is the top of the XTS line, with a turbocharged engine, producing . The next year, the third generation CTS was started to being offered with a Vsport trimline, however with an increased output of . Both of them were the only \"V\"-badged vehicles of Cadillac until announcement of CTS-V and ATS-V. The V-Sport trim designation was discontinued with the CTS and XTS sedan phase-outs in 2019 and 2020, respectively. ===CTS-V=== The CTS-V continues the V8 engine tradition of V series, now with a LT4 engine shared with the Chevrolet Corvette (C7) Z06, producing and , as the most powerful Cadillac ever produced till date. It weighs and its top speed is . It will be released as a 2016 model, along with smaller ATS-V. The third-generation CTS-V is set to rival the Mercedes-Benz E-63 AMG along with the BMW M5. It was discontinued with the CTS line in 2019. ===ATS-V=== The Cadillac ATS-V is intended to compete against BMW M4/BMW M3 and Audi RS4. The ATS-V is the first V6-engined V series of Cadillac ever, with a LF4 engine that produces 464 hp and 445 lb ft. The ATS-V was discontinued with the ATS line in 2019. ==Fourth-generation V series== Cadillac CT6-V Cadillac CT5-V Cadillac CT4-V The fourth generation V series was the first to incorporate Cadillac's new \"Escala\" design language with the all-new Cadillac CT6-V in 2020. This began a new era for the V series, in that none of the three all-new V series sedans, the CT6-V, the CT5-V, nor the CT4-V, were available with a pushrod General Motors small-block V8 engine. The CT6-V made use of Cadillac's all-new Blackwing V8, while the CT5-V used GM's 3-liter twin-turbo LGY V6, and the CT4-V a 2.7 liter turbo inline 4-cylinder engine. This generation also marked the beginning of a new V series trim strategy, where the \"V\" trims would become the entry-level performance variants (a position previously held by the V-Sport trim level), and a new, higher V series trim would mark the high-power, hard-core performance variant, previously denoted by the straight \"V.\" The higher-output CT5-V and CT4-V variants have been rumored to come equipped with the LT4 supercharged V8 and 3.6 High-Feature twin-turbo V6, respectively, and both will offer automatic and manual transmissions. ==References== == External links == * Official V-Series website * CadillacFAQ.com-Information, pictures, video, documents and more on the V series V series Category:Car brands Category:Official motorsports and performance division of automakers ",
