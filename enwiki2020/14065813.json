    "text": "Stefano di Francesco (died 1427) was an Italian (Florentine) painter, who probably died young, as he left a five-year-old son, and was outlived twenty years by his father-in-law, the painter Giuliano Pesello (1367\u20131446). His son was the painter Francesco Pesellino (1422\u20131457), the most distinguished of the three. Nothing is known of Stefano di Francesco's painting. == References == * Corti, Gino and Frederick Hartt, Documents, The Art Bulletin, Vol. 44, No. 2 (Jun., 1962), 155-167. * Vasari, Giorgio, Le Vite delle pi\u00f9 eccellenti pittori, scultori, ed architettori, many editions and translations.
