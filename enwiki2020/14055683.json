    "text": "The 2008 congressional elections in Illinois were held on November 4, 2008 to determine who would represent the state of Illinois in the United States House of Representatives, coinciding with the presidential and senatorial elections. Representatives are elected for two-year terms; those elected served in the 111th Congress from January 3, 2009 until January 3, 2011. Illinois has nineteen seats in the House, apportioned according to the 2000 United States Census. Its 2007-2008 congressional delegation consisted of eleven Democrats and eight Republicans. It became, following the election, twelve Democrats and seven Republicans. District 11 was the only seat which changed party (from open Republican to Democratic), although CQ Politics had forecast districts 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 18 to be at some risk for the incumbent party. ==Overview== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" |- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" ! colspan=\"6\" | United States House of Representatives elections in Illinois, 2008http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2008/2008Stat.htm#stateIL |- bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" align=\"center\" ! colspan=2 style=\"width: 15em\" |Party ! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes ! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage ! style=\"width: 5em\" |Seats ! style=\"width: 5em\" |+/\u2013 |- ! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" | | style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic | align=\"right\" | 3,176,203 | align=\"right\" | 60.52% | align=\"right\" | 12 | align=\"right\" | +1 |- ! style=\"background-color:#FF3333; width: 3px\" | | style=\"width: 130px\" | Republican | align=\"right\" | 1,961,173 | align=\"right\" | 37.37% | align=\"right\" | 7 | align=\"right\" | -1 |- ! style=\"background-color:#DDDDDD; width: 3px\" | | style=\"width: 130px\" | Independents | align=\"right\" | 110,819 | align=\"right\" | 2.11% | align=\"right\" | 0 | align=\"right\" | \u2014 |-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" | colspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" | Totals | align=\"right\" | 5,248,195 | align=\"right\" | 100.00% | align=\"right\" | 19 | align=\"right\" | \u2014 |-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" |} ==District 1== thumb This district includes part of Cook County.
