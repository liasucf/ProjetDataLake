After graduating high school, Hollis moved to Los Angeles, CA. Once there, she got a job at Miramax. While working there, she met her husband and founded an event-planning company called Chic Events. ==Career== Her breakthrough moment on social media came in March 2015, when an Instagram photo of her celebrating her stretch marks went viral. \"I wear a bikini because I'm proud of this body and every mark on it. Those marks prove that I was blessed enough to carry my babies and that flabby tummy means I worked hard to lose what weight I could,\" she wrote in the post. It garnered more than 10 million views. Hollis' book Girl, Wash Your Face is described by The Washington Post as mixing \"memoir, motivational tips, Bible quotations and common-sense girl talk.\" The prevailing message of Girl, Wash Your Face is one largely of female self-reliance, summed up by Hollis as \"You, and only you, are ultimately responsible for how happy you are.\" Since the success of her book, Hollis and her family have moved outside of Austin, Texas. She frequently posts YouTube videos with motivational messages, and has garnered over 163,000 subscribers. In 2019, Hollis released a follow-up book, Girl, Stop Apologizing. Hollis has been accused of plagiarizing quotes in her work, on her Instagram as well as in many of her motivational speeches by several publications.
