Alongside her artistic practice, Malbeuf teaches the skills and traditions of caribou and moose hair tufting and embroidery. == Education == Malbeuf received her BFA from the Alberta College of Art + Design in Calgary and an MFA in Visual Art from the University of British Columbia Okanagan in Kelowna.

Her practice examines the relationships between humanity and nature by deconstructing misunderstandings of Native culture and exploring intersections between culture and race.
