It was formed from the parishes of Our Lady of Angels and St. Michael.

On May 6, 1894 they established the devotion in the parish, distributing prayer cards.

The perpetual novena to Mary under the title of Our Lady of Perpetual Help continues.\"Our History\", Our Lady of Perpetual Help Construction on the current church began in 1907. The lower level was opened for services two years later, with the upper church completed in 1928. The Church was designated a minor Basilica on November 1, 1969.\"Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help\", nycago.com At the time of its completion, the parish was largely Irish in character (as evidenced by the inscriptions on the memorial windows). It was built on what was known as Irish Hill. Some of the family names include Collins, Brennan, Wade, Connors, Burns, McCaffrey, Healy, and Coffey. There is still an Irish presence, but today it is predominantly Hispanic and Chinese. The Basilica enjoys large attendance, particularly on holidays such as Ash Wednesday, Palm Sunday and Christmas. The parish offers immigration services in its Juan Neumann Center, operates a food pantry, hosts a Chinese senior citizen group and leases space to benefit the community to a pre-k program and Lutheran Medical Center. ==Description== The basilica, founded and still staffed by the Redemptorists, is a Roman Catholic parish church of the Diocese of Brooklyn. It is dedicated to Our Lady of Perpetual Help, and serves as a pro-cathedral. The architect was Franz Joseph Untersee of Boston. The granite church is Romanesque with a limestone exterior. As a double chapel, the basilica has two floors of worship, like the Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi. The upstairs church was commonly only used to host weddings and special group services such as confirmation and communion, but has come back into more frequent use. For many years, mass in Spanish was held upstairs because of the large number of parishioners in attendance. Masses are also celebrated in Chinese and Vietnamese. The lower level is for smaller services. The first floor has been renovated many times in recent years. Because of its size, the Basilica hosts major diocesan services (e.g., ordinations)Ordination of Bishops dioceseofbrooklyn.org that would otherwise be held at Brooklyn's other, considerably smaller basilica, the Cathedral Basilica of St. James. For the same reason, it also hosts sadder events; it is a venue-of-choice for the larger funerals of those who have fallen in the line of duty while in the service of the New York City Police Department and the New York City Fire Department. ==Surroundings== OLPH school The parish has an elementary school down the block on 6th Avenue and 59th and 60th Street.
