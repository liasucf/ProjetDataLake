    "text": "Build The Earth (BTE) is a project dedicated to recreating the Earth in a 1:1 scale in Minecraft. The project has attracted hundreds of thousands of users to its Discord server, and has surpassed 6,000 officially registered builders. It is virtually cost-free aside from server hosting and owning a Minecraft account. == Organization == Users who wish to officially register as builders can do so on Build The Earth's official website. Users may build by themselves (solo builds) if the area they will be building is not that extense, or form part of any of the build teams, individually organized groups of builders that are dedicated to building large areas, such as countries or states. For both of these, the builder must create two buildings in the game, and send a screenshot as part of an application form, which will be reviewed by the project's Review Committee\u2014in the case of a solo build\u2014or by the build team's reviewers\u2014in the case of a build team. Most build teams have created Minecraft servers using the official mod-pack, to ease the process of connecting every user's buildings. Some build teams, even, have created \u201chub\u201d servers, which connect multiple servers and make it easier for new users to join their desired build team's server. An example of this is Europe's server, which connects every build team in Europe. If a builder decides to participate in a solo build, they must create a single-player world instead. Once significant progress has been made, build teams and solo builders must upload their world files to the official website. These will be reviewed, and automatically merged into the master world. === Discord === All organization actions, excepting land claiming, and announcements, are managed on the project's official Discord server. Individual build teams also have their autonomous Discord servers, and every builder of the project must have a Discord account. Once a user is accepted as a builder, they are automatically given the Builder role on the main server. === Bedrock Edition === At the start of the project, Build The Earth only allowed users with the Java Edition of the game to build. A system that let Bedrock users build for the project was later implemented. Users may claim individual areas, or join one of the two default Bedrock servers, which are working on Anchorage, Alaska and Riga, Latvia. === MineFact === The YouTuber MineFact implemented an alternative system for Build The Earth which does not depend on any mods and can run on Minecraft 1.16, instead of the current version of the Build The Earth mod-pack, 1.12, which is dependant on the latest version supported by CubicChunks. He initially developed the system to be used to build New York, though later on it was planned to be used on other big cities. == History == === Beginning === On 21 March 2020, YouTuber PippenFTS released a video titled The Earth in Minecraft, 1:1 scale... for the first time, in which he talked about the map, how it was made, and called for talented Minecraft players to help build. Within a few days, the video went viral, accumulating over 11 million views by September 2020. By the end of March 2020, the BTE subreddit, Twitter account, and Instagram account had been set up and were growing rapidly. A Patreon page was created on March 26th, and currently accumulates over $250 a month from more than 50 patrons. The Discord server, where the project was synthesized and is currently being managed in, hit 50,000 members by March 29th and 200,000 by the end of April; it currently has about 230,000 members, though the amount of new members has decreased. === Projection vote === On April 3rd, PippenFTS released a video outlining the problems of the currently used projection, the Equirectangular projection, including its \u201cdisastrous\u201d distortion. He explained that after days of research, he and his team narrowed down what could be the next used projection to either the Mercator projection or a modified version of the Dymaxion projection, a \u201cmore contemporary design.\u201d On the next day, he created two polls in the Build The Earth Discord server; one asking whether the map projection should be changed, and the other asking which the new map projection should be, if it were to change. Nine days later, the official map projection used for the project was updated to the modified version of Dymaxion, named Modified Airocean. Five days later, the official project website was released. === Collaborations and advertising === On Earth Day, Mojang released an article featuring the project on their website, attracting even more users to the project. On July 5th, MrBeast, a YouTuber and social media influencer, released a video where he and a group of other players re-built his hometown, Raleigh, North Carolina, in 24 hours. The video reached 11 million views, though the Discord server did not see a surge of new users as big as expected. MrBeast also made a second video in Raleigh, in which he played hide and seek for $10,000. Several members of BuildTheEarth participated, although none of them won. == Resources == === Mods === The Build The Earth project primarily depends on the Terra 1-to-1 mod, which is in charge of generating all of the terrain, streets, building guides, etc., if available, as to ease the building process. Of course, most of the time, dimensions of the real life won't fit into the normal limits of Minecraft. Thus, it depends on two other mods to function: *CubicChunks, which essentially bypasses the 256-block height limit and the negative height limit of vanilla Minecraft. *CubicWorldGen, which enables the customization of terrain generation in conjunction with CubicChunks. The official mod-pack also provides a few other utility mods by default, that can prove to be useful when building: *JourneyMap, which allows users to see their surrounding areas from a mini-map. *WorldEdit, a powerful and well-known tool used for creating and modifying buildings swiftly. *EffortlessBuilding, similar to WorldEdit, but with less features and a more user-friendly interface, a GUI. It also includes two other lightweight mods, Performant and VanillaFix, which can help with certain performance improvements, though are not strictly needed. The project has sparked the development of many 3rd party tools used to assist builders and server owners. The most notable include: * Terramap, an in-game map that allows users to easily teleport across the Terra 1-to-1 projection. * BTE- Tools, a custom tool used for generating rails, hedges, and shapes. * Sledgehammer, a proxy addon which allows server owners to create hubs which connect multiple build teams together. PippenFTS stated that \"with the CubicChunks mod breaking Minecraft's vertical limitations, we can now experience the Earth in Minecraft, just as it is, with no downscaling of any kind.\" === Terrain generation === Terra 1-to-1 uses various API instances to generate a Minecraft world based on real-life data. These include a Mapzen Terrain Tile instance for elevation data, an ArcGIS REST API instance to generate tree cover, and an Overpass interpreter for OpenStreetMap to generate water, roads, and building outlines. === Map projection === Modified Airocean projection The Terra 1-to-1 mod implements several map projections by default; including the transverse Mercator, sinusoidal, Equal Earth, equirectangular, and Dymaxion or Airocean projections, and a modified version of the latter, made specifically for the project, named Modified Airocean or Airocean-edit. PippenFTS released a YouTube video titled We are now ready to Build The Earth, 1:1 scale in Minecraft, in which he detailed the process undergone to create it. This map projection provides an extremely low amount of distortion of both shapes and sizes on land, at the cost of heavily distorting the oceans. Unlike a typical Airocean projection, Modified Airocean is not intended to be unfolded into a 3D object like an icosahedron, and has its continents placed such that it looks somewhat similar to an equirectangular projection. The projection used is configurable per world, though the project requires every contributing builder and build team to use the modified Airocean projection. == Progress and Teams == === Build Teams === Build Teams are groups of people who work together to complete an area. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | List of official BuildTheEarth Build Teams |- ! scope=\"col\" | Team Name !! scope=\"col\" | Location !! scope=\"col\" | Owner !! scope=\"col\" | Area Covered (km2) !! scope=\"col\" | Members |- | New Jersey Build Team || New Jersey || Corruptplex || 22,610 km\u00b2 || 604 |} == References == == External links == * *Official subreddit * Category:Minecraft servers Category:Games adapted into works Category:Gaming conventions ",
