    "text": "Million Pound Menu is a twelve-part English-language reality-TV series hosted by Fred Sirieix, wherein participants try to convince a jury that their new restaurant ideas could work. In each episode of the first series, two new restaurant ideas get their own pop-up in Manchester in an attempt to gain backing from the investors. In season two, the format changed. Three concept teams of hopeful restaurateurs prepare their signature dish for four potential investors. By majority vote, the investors select one team to open a two-day pop-up restaurant in Manchester, England. (Investors can drop out at any point). Once in Manchester, the concept team runs a soft-launch dinner service (where customers pay 50% of the normal price). The investors dine with each other during this service. On the morning of the second day, the concept team has one-hour business meetings with each investor. Afterwards, the team conducts a full-price lunch, where the remaining investors dine alone and also interview customers. Afterwards, the investors are given a deadline of 7pm to return to the restaurant to present an offer. If multiple investors make offers, the team picks the investor they want to work with. ==Cast== *Fred Sirieix ==Release== The show was released on May 17, 2018, on Netflix streaming. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2010s documentary television series Category:English-language television shows ",
