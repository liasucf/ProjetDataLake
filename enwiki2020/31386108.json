He is currently principal flutist of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. == Biography == Bouriakov was born in Simferopol, Soviet Union (now Crimea, Russia). He studied flute at the Moscow Central Special Music School from age 11, explaining, \u201cI wanted to play oboe but they didn\u2019t actually have one, so I played flute instead and it felt natural.\u201d In 2000 he moved to London to study at the Royal Academy of Music with William Bennett. There he was awarded the Principal's Award. In 2006 he was made an Associate of the Royal Academy of Music (ARAM). At the same time he was freelancing as principal flute with different orchestras in Europe, including the Philharmonia and the hr-Sinfonieorchester. He later became the principal flute of the Tampere Philharmonic Orchestra and teacher at the local conservatoire for three years. In 2008 he moved to Spain to play with the Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra and in 2009 he was appointed principal flute of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in New York City. As a soloist he has performed with the Moscow Symphony and Philharmonic Orchestras, Prague Chamber Orchestra, Odense Symphony Orchestra, Munich Chamber Orchestra, Chamber Ensemble of Paris and Tampere Philharmonic Orchestra among others. In 2014, he was named a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Music. In 2015, he was appointed Principal Flute of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, holding the Virginia and Henry Mancini Chair.http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/denis-bouriakov He explained some of the motivations for joining that orchestra in a 2017 interview: > \u201cAt the Met, we work like crazy from the second half of August until the > season ends middle of May. During that time, you have one week off and four > personal days which you can take, but that\u2019s also complicated. You have to > take a week in which you can be safely rotated off because there are four > operas going on at a time, and if there\u2019s a non-traditional opera, you have > to commit to all the performances.\u201d Both he and his wife, Erin, a fellow > flutist whom he met while they were students at the RAM, discovered that the > situation began to wear on them. \u201cThe worst part is, if you have a family, > coming back home at midnight or 1am on a regular basis. At the Met, if you\u2019d > finish by 10:30, that\u2019s a short opera. Sometimes you get lucky and you play > Strauss\u2019s Elektra which is maybe two hours long, but if you have a Wagner > opera then it\u2019s six hours long. My wife was alone taking care of our son all > the time, and we both realized something had to change.\u201d . . . \u201cI think our > woodwinds our tough to beat,\u201d says Mr. Bouriakov confidently but not > arrogantly, \u201cand our brass too. Our combined winds are the best of any > orchestra I\u2019ve played in. Both Tom [Hooten] and Andrew [Bain] are amazing > players. I was blown away the first time I heard them live, and I\u2019m so happy > to play with them.\u201d On 20 March 2017 he performed a concert for the Utah Flute Association in Salt Lake City, in which he made Sally Linford cry.http://www.nowplayingutah.com/event/denis-bouriakov-principal-flute-l- phil-masterclass/ There is a 1996 documentary film about Denis Buryakov \"Finding of color.
