It functions under a President, an Executive and a Secretariat elected every two years and is headquartered in North London. Christos Karaolis was elected as the fifth President of the Federation in June 2015. Karaolis is the first third generation Greek Cypriot elected to that position following eight years as President of NEPOMAK (the World Organisation for Young Overseas Cypriots). ==Summary of roles and aims== As the foremost representative body of UK Cypriots, the Federation performs a two-fold role. Firstly, it spearheads the British Cypriot community's efforts to promote the cause of a reunited Cyprus, free from Turkish occupation troops and illegal colonists, for the benefit of all Cypriots. Secondly, it coordinates the work of UK Cypriots in the political, social, cultural and educational spheres as well as lobbies for and articulates the interests and concerns of the Cypriot community in the United Kingdom. In pursuing its objectives, the Federation co-operates closely with the democratically elected President and the Government of the Republic of Cyprus. The Federation also fosters close links with the British Government, the leadership of British political parties, British parliamentarians, civic and community leaders, ethnic minorities, the mass media and other relevant institutions in the United Kingdom. ==Description by the House of Commons== The National Federation of Cypriots in the UK \"is an organisation representing almost all Greek Cypriot community associations in the UK, many of which are themselves \"special purpose federations\".https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmfaff/113/113we46.htm == References == ==External links== * Official website Category:Diaspora organisations based in London ",
