    "text": "\"The Name of the Game Was Love\" is a single by Canadian country music artist Hank Snow. It was written by Cy Coben. The song peaked at number 1 on the RPM Country Tracks chart. It also reached number 16 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in the United States. The song is a tongue-twister in the same vein as Snow's earlier hit I've Been Everywhere. In the lyrics, the narrator finds an old address book that listed all the girls he dated. He then begins reciting the names of all the girls. ==Chart performance== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (1969) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Canadian RPM Country Tracks |align=\"center\"|1 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles |align=\"center\"|16 |} ==References== Category:1969 singles Category:Hank Snow songs Category:RPM Country Tracks number-one singles Category:Songs written by Cy Coben Category:1969 songs Category:RCA Records singles ",
