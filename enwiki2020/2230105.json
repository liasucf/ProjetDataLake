    "text": "\"Innervision\" is a song by Armenian American heavy metal band System of a Down, released as a promotional single from their third studio album, Steal This Album! ==Overview== This single is the only single released from Steal This Album! to be non-airplay only. As in the case with most songs from Steal This Album!, it has only been played live on very few occasions (with the exception of the 2011-2012 Reunion Tour). The song was leaked prior to the album's release, although it was not included in the Toxicity II bootleg, rather than being leaked in a separate way. The origin of the leak is unknown. The leaked version features a slightly different arrangement and lyrics, most predominantly in the bridge and second verse where layered vocals are used on the album version. ==Track listing== ==Chart positions== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (2002) !Peak position |- |US Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|7 |- | |- | |} ==References== ==External links== *\"Innervision\" lyrics on Systemofadown.com Category:System of a Down songs Category:2002 singles Category:Song recordings produced by Rick Rubin ",
