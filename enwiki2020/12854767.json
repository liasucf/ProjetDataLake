He was baptised with the names Luis Fernando Mar\u00eda Zacar\u00edas; the name Zacar\u00edas is in honour of Saint Zechariah on whose feast day Luis Fernando was born. In 1899 Luis Fernando and his older brother Alfonso were sent to England to be educated by the Jesuits at Beaumont College.Bernardo Rodr\u00edguez Caparrini, \"A Catholic Public School in the Making\", Paedagogica Historica 39 (December 2003): 743.

Slim, pallid, round- and restless-eyed like a bird, sullen looking, with lovely hands like those of a Co\u00ebllo Infanta, he promenaded his lubricous little royal person from drawing-room to awful bouges and then, ingratiatingly and affectionately, he would sink like an abandoned child at the feet of some 'Good Dame' and lament his lot.\"Elisabeth de Gramont, Years of Plenty, translated by Florence and Victor Llona, New York: Jonathan Cape and Harrison Smith, 1931, p. 114. ===Marriage rumors and exile=== On July 17, 1914, The New York Times reported the marriage of Luis Fernando to Beatrice Harrington.\"Prince Weds a Commoner\", The New York Times (July 17, 1914): 4.
