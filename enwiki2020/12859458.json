Over the years, it has had different spellings such as Brivamagus, Brivomagus, Brimeaus (in 1153), Brimodio and Brimodium (in 1154), Brimaus in 1226, Brimeul in 1415, Brimeu by 1499, and finally Brimeux, in 1704. When peat was extracted at Brimeux, a 5 metre long wooden deck, a tin dish and flakes of flint were discovered, indicating that Brimeux had been inhabited before the arrival of the Romans. Various objects of the Gallo-Roman era were unearthed during the construction of the railway station: coins; weights and the remains of a villa. The area was ransacked by the invading Normans in 842. There are traces of the motte of the feudal castle owned by the House of Brimeu, seigneurs of the village. ==Sights== * The church. Built between 1495 and 1524 by the seigneur, Hugh de Melun, in flamboyant Gothic style. The nave was restored in 1860 by the architect Norman Clovis who gave it the character that we see today. The bell tower once housed 3 bells but now only has the one, the others having been confiscated in 1793 * The war memorial erected in 1920. ==Population== The inhabitants are called Brimeusois. ==See also== *Communes of the Pas-de-Calais department ==References== * INSEE commune file ==External links== * Cyclo Club Brimeux, cycling club of Brimeux Category:Communes of Pas-de-Calais ",
