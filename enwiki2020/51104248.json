    "text": "Progress MS-11 (), identified by NASA as Progress 72P, is a Progress spacecraft used by Roscosmos to resupply the International Space Station (ISS). This is the 163rd flight of a Progress spacecraft. == History == The Progress-MS is a uncrewed freighter based on the Progress-M featuring improved avionics. This improved variant first launched on 21 December 2015. It has the following improvements: * New external compartment that enables it to deploy satellites. Each compartment can hold up to four launch containers. First time installed on Progress MS-03. * Enhanced redundancy thanks to the addition of a backup system of electrical motors for the docking and sealing mechanism. * Improved Micrometeoroid (MMOD) protection with additional panels in the cargo compartment. * Luch Russian relay satellites link capabilities enable telemetry and control even when not in direct view of ground radio stations. * GNSS autonomous navigation enables real time determination of the status vector and orbital parameters dispensing with the need of ground station orbit determination. * Real time relative navigation thanks to direct radio data exchange capabilities with the space station. * New digital radio that enables enhanced TV camera view for the docking operations. * The Ukrainian Chezara Kvant-V on board radio system and antenna/feeder system has been replaced with a Unified Command Telemetry System (UCTS). * Replacement of the Kurs A with Kurs NA digital system. ==Pre-launch== In 2014, the launch was scheduled for 16 April 2018. In November 2018, delays with the launch of the EgyptSat-A spacecraft and required the launch to 28 March 2019, the Kommersant newspaper reported. In January 2019, RIA Novosti reported that the launch had been pushed to 4 April 2019. ==Launch== Progress MS-11 launched on 4 April 2019, at 11:01:34 UTC from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. It used a Soyuz-2.1a rocket. ==Docking== Progress MS-11 docked with the docking port of the Pirs module just 3 hours and 22 minutes after the launch, at 14:22:26 UTC. ==Cargo== The Progress MS-14 spacecraft delivered 3,400 kg of cargo, with 1,400 kg of this being dry cargo. The following is a breakdown of cargo bound for the ISS: * Dry cargo: 1,400 kg * Fuel: 900 kg * Compressed Air: 47 kg * Water: 420 kg (Rodnik system) Equipment for several life science experiments, including Bioplenka, Konstanta-2, Produtsent, Mikrovir, Struktura, Biodegradatsiya and Kristallizator. The spacecraft also carried the Faza vessel for growing water plants and the associated lighting system for the Ryaska educational experiment. ==Undocking and decay== It undocked at 10:43 UTC, on 29 July 2019. And decay in the atmosphere and its debris entered the Pacific Ocean, on the same day. == See also == * Uncrewed spaceflights to the International Space Station ==References== Category:Progress (spacecraft) missions Category:Spacecraft launched in 2019 Category:2019 in Russia Category:Supply vehicles for the International Space Station Category:Spacecraft launched by Soyuz-2 rockets Category:Spacecraft which reentered in 2019 ",
