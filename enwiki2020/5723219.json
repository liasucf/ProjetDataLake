Designed by prominent architect Abner Cook, it was built in 1854 and has been the home of every governor since 1856. Governor Greg Abbott and First Lady Cecilia Phalen Abbott are the current residents. On June 8, 2008, while midway through a major renovation, the mansion was badly damaged by an arson fire started with a Molotov cocktail. ==History== The mansion is the oldest continuously inhabited house in Texas and fourth oldest governor's mansion in the United States that has been continuously occupied by a chief executive. The mansion was the first-designated Texas historic landmark, in 1962. and It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as \"Governor's Mansion\" in 1970, and further was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1974. ==Original architecture== Built by Abner Cook in a Greek Revival style and completed in 1856, the building occupies the center of a block and is surrounded by trees and gardens. The original mansion was . Remodeling in 1914 increased the size of the mansion to 8,920 square feet. The original mansion had 11 rooms but no bathrooms. The remodeling brought the room count to 25 rooms and 7 bathrooms. In 1931, at the recommendation of former Texas First Lady Mildred Paxton Moody, the Forty- second Texas Legislature established the Board of Mansion Supervisors to oversee all interior and exterior upkeep and enhancements to the mansion. Mrs. Moody was the first head of the Board, which was abolished in 1965. ==2008 fire== The mansion was partially destroyed by a four-alarm fire during the early morning of June 8, 2008. Then-Governor Rick Perry and his wife Anita Thigpen Perry were in Europe at the time of the fire. They had relocated in October 2007 for a $10 million major deferred maintenance project that began in January 2008. The project was to include a fire suppression system. State Fire Marshal Paul Maldonado said the next Sunday that investigators had evidence that an arsonist targeted the 152-year-old building. On February 2, 2011, Chief Tony Leal, an assistant director of the Texas Rangers, announced that a person of interest has been identified that is connected to an Austin- based anarchist group which has also been linked to an attack (involving Molotov cocktails) which was planned for the Republican National Convention in St. Paul during September 2008. No one has ever been charged and there has never been any evidence linking anarchist involvement to date. An official close to the investigation said agents determined the fire was a criminal act \"after reviewing footage from security cameras.\" To date the crime has gone unclaimed. A restoration was begun, with a scheduled completion in 2012. In May 2009, $22 million was allocated to the restoration of the Governor's Mansion, $11 million of which came from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. An additional $3.4 million has been raised through private fund raising. The restoration area, which includes the mansion and the adjacent segment of Colorado Street, has been closed to the public with a chain-link fence and barbed wire. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places in Travis County, Texas *List of National Historic Landmarks in Texas == References == === Citations === === Sources === * \"The Texas Governor's Mansion,\" The Magazine ANTIQUES, July 2006. == External links == * * Friends of the Texas Governor's Mansion - includes history, photos, visiting information * Category:City of Austin Historic Landmarks Category:Museums in Austin, Texas Category:Houses in Austin, Texas Category:Historic house museums in Texas Category:Governors' mansions in the United States Category:Government buildings in Texas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Austin, Texas Category:National Historic Landmarks in Texas Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Texas Category:Buildings and structures in the United States destroyed by arson Category:Greek Revival houses in Texas Category:Arson in Texas Category:Government buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Texas Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Texas Category:Texas State Antiquities Landmarks Category:Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks Category:Burned houses in the United States Category:Attacks on government buildings and structures ",
