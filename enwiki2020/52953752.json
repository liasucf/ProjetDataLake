    "text": "I'm Willing is the sixth album by Canadian music artist Marker Starling (Chris A. Cummings), released in 2016 in Europe and in 2017 in North America. It is a collection of cover versions. Limiting himself to a much pared-down instrumentation in contrast to 2015's Rosy Maze, Cummings recorded the album in a very short time in Paris, which he feels helped the creative process retain a vibrancy necessary to the project. Having L\u00e6titia Sadier of Stereolab contributing vocals also helped him achieve the ambiance he strove to create as the album has a recurring theme of love and affection. The cross-section of songs covered ranges from highly regarded classics to little known gems that Cummings discovered over the years as an ardent vinyl collector. ==Track listing== ===Side 1=== # Stormy (Dennis Yost, J.R.
