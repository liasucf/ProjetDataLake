    "text": "The Burdekin Gap, named for the Burdekin River, is a biogeographical feature in Queensland, northeastern Australia, which separates populations of freshwater fishes and other water-dependent land animals, such as the delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata) by a corridor of hot and dry habitat that acts as a barrier to genetic exchange. Birds, except those that are rainforest- dependent,John C. Avise, Phylogeography: the history and formation of species, 2000, map, p.254. are more likely to intergrade across the Gap. ==Notes== Category:Biogeography of Australia Category:Natural history of Australia Category:Geography of Queensland ",
