It is situated north of the Cytadela park (the former Pozna\u0144 citadel). The name refers to the vineyards which formerly existed in the area \u2013 historically there were two villages there called Winiary (although \"Winiary\" today refers to a neighbourhood in Je\u017cyce district, to which the inhabitants were moved when the citadel fortifications were built in the 1830s). The southern part of Winogrady, between the streets ul. Winogrady and ul. S\u0142owia\u0144ska, consists mainly of houses, although there are also some apartment blocks (including the \"Batman\" development, named for its black colour) and student halls of residence. North of this is an area which consists of large estates of apartment blocks, mostly built from pre- fabricated concrete panels from 1968 onwards. Most of these blocks and the estate infrastructure belong to the PSM Winogrady (Pozna\u0144ska Sp\u00f3\u0142dzielnia Mieszkaniowa Winogrady) housing cooperative, founded as a separate entity in 1984 (the development having previously been carried out by the PSM cooperative which now administers only the Pi\u0105tkowo estates). The Winogrady estates house approximately 43,000 people, about 7\u20138% of the city's population. The estates (osiedla) are called Osiedle Pod Lipami (\"Under the Lime Trees\"), Osiedle Przyja\u017ani (\"Friendship\"), Osiedle Kosmonaut\u00f3w (\"Cosmonauts'\"), Osiedle Wichrowe Wzg\u00f3rze (\"Wuthering Heights\") and Osiedle Zwyci\u0119stwa (\"Victory\"). There is also a newer estate (Osiedle Na Murawie) to the east of the district. Wichrowe Wzg\u00f3rze was originally called Osiedle Kraju Rad (\"Estate of the Land of Councils\", referring to the Soviet Union), and Pod Lipami was called Osiedle Wielkiego Pa\u017adziernika (\"Estate of Great October\", referring to the October Revolution); these were renamed after the fall of the communist regime. For city governmental purposes, the area is divided into four parts, which also called osiedla: Stare Winogrady (\"Old Winogrady\"), Nowe Winogrady P\u00f3\u0142noc (\"New Winogrady North\"), Nowe Winogrady Wsch\u00f3d (\"New Winogrady East\"), and Nowe Winogrady Po\u0142udnie (\"New Winogrady South\"). See Administrative division of Pozna\u0144. The main street Aleje Solidarno\u015bci (\"Solidarity Avenue\"), formerly ul. Serbska (\"Serb Street\"), runs between Przyja\u017ani and Pod Lipami to the south, and Zwyci\u0119stwa, Wichrowe Wzg\u00f3rze and Kosmonaut\u00f3w to the north. North of the latter estates is ul. Lechicka, a main transit route through Pozna\u0144, north of which are a number of similar estates in the neighbourhood of Pi\u0105tkowo. The Plaza and Pestka shopping and entertainment complexes are located on the south side of this street, in the north of Winogrady. The Pozna\u0144 Fast Tram Route (\"Pestka\") runs west of the Winogrady estates, continuing northwards to Pi\u0105tkowo and southwards to the city centre. There are also older tram lines which run from the centre eastwards along ul. Winogrady and then northwards, serving the eastern parts of the district. ==References== *Winogrady housing cooperative website Category:Neighbourhoods of Pozna\u0144 ",
