While this interpretation may appear to some to be a departure from the traditional view of seeking refuge in the Three Jewels (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha), it is actually a deliberate declaration and poetic polemic of the Chan (Zen) school written as a response to the increasingly popular movement of faith in Amitaba Buddha known as Pure Land Buddhism. From the Chan/Zen point of view, Buddha and Mind are one (\u5373\u5fc3\u5373\u4f5b) (see the Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch (\u516d\u7956\u58c7\u7d93)), as expressed in Mazu's famous dictum \"Mind is Buddha\". Thus, faith in outward Buddhas is contrary to the goal of Buddhism, which is the direct experience of enlightenment. This can only be attained by having faith in Mind as Shakyamuni Buddha himself did. Variations of the title include: \"Inscription on Trust in the Mind\", \"Verses on the Faith Mind\", and \"On Believing in Mind\", as well as others. John McRae (1986:316 n. 64) argues that the title should be translated as \"Inscription on Relying on the Mind\" or \"Inscription of the Perfected Mind\". The word \"inscription\" does accurately convey the idea of a truth that can survive the test of time and is the more literal meaning of ming (\u9298). Another reading of the text allows that Xinxin could be understood as the Truthful Mind, which is always ready and perfect, implying that there is no need to further \"perfect\" it. Because in the Chinese language today, Xinxin (\u4fe1\u5fc3) usually means \"trust\", \"confidence\", or \"believing mind\", it is often forgotten that Xinxin can also be understood as the truthful mind (\u4fe1\u5be6\u7684\u5fc3).A translation of the Xinxin Ming based on this interpretation is available at: . This is consistent with the traditional view of Buddha nature being there all the time. It just waits to be rediscovered. From the Chan/Zen view, the true mind is perfect as it is and only false views obscure the true mind's inherent perfection. As the text states, \"Any degeneration of your previous practice on emptiness arises because of false perspectives. There is really no need to go after the Truth but there is indeed a need to extinguish biased views.\" (\u524d\u7a7a\u8f49\u8b8a \u7686\u7531\u5984\u898b \u4e0d\u7528\u6c42\u771f \u552f\u9808\u606f\u898b) Moreover, the passage that follows immediately after explicitly warns against losing the original, true mind (\u5931\u5fc3): \"Do not dwell in the two biased views. Make sure you do not pursue. The moment you think about right and wrong, that moment you unwittingly lose your true mind.\" (\u4e8c\u898b\u4e0d\u4f4f \u614e\u52ff\u8ffd\u5c0b \u624d\u6709\u662f\u975e \u7d1b\u7136\u5931\u5fc3) Whether translated as Faith in Mind, Believing in Mind, Trust in Mind, or The Truthful Mind, the central message of the Xinxin Ming is the same: to point directly to Mind by giving up one-sided views so we can see the One Suchness of reality as it is.(\u5fc3\u82e5\u4e0d\u7570 \u842c\u6cd5\u4e00\u5982) == Authorship == Although Sengcan has been traditionally been attributed as the author, modern scholars believe that the verse was written well after Sengcan's death, probably during the Tang Dynasty (Chinese: \u5510\u671d; pinyin: T\u00e1ngch\u00e1o) (618 \u2013 907). (Dumoulin, p 97) Some scholars note the similarity with a poem called Mind InscriptionSacred Texts Henrik H. Sorensen translation of \"Mind Inscription\", the possible original source of Xinxin Ming by Niu-t'ou Fa-jung (594-657) (Gozu H\u00f5y\u00fb \u725b\u982d\u6cd5\u878d) of the Oxhead school of Chan and have speculated that the Xinxin Ming is an abridged version of the Mind Inscription. The classical source of the Xinxin Ming can be found in the Transmission of the Lamp (Wade\u2013Giles: Ching-te Ch'uan-teng Lu; Japanese: Keitoku Denk\u014droku \u666f\u5fb7\u50b3\u71c8\u9304 \u666f\u5fb3\u4f1d\u706f\u9332).for a fuller discussion on authorship see Sacred Texts == History == The Xinxin Ming has been much beloved by Chan (Zen) practitioners for over a thousand years. It is still studied in Western Zen circles.See, e.g., Soeng (2004), p. xiii: \"The poem ... is one of the most beloved texts of the Zen tradition and one of the most familiar of the early Zen texts.\" As an early expression of Chan Buddhism, the Inscription on Faith in Mind reveals the Buddhist missionary use of expedient means (upaya) in China by adapting Taoist terminology to the Buddhist context of awakening. It also draws on the Wisdom sutras as well as the Avatamsaka Sutra and Lankavatara Sutra to express the essential unity of opposites and the basic nature of emptiness (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101) The early great proponent of the Buddhist analysis of emptiness was Nagarjuna (c.150-250 AD) (Chinese: \u9f8d\u6a39). The poem professes the need to take pleasant and unpleasant life experiences with a sense of equanimity. Broadly speaking, the Xinxin Ming deals with the principles and practice of non-duality, that is, with the application of nonduality and the results of its practice.See Pajin (1988). == Excerpts == ===Opening verse=== The opening verse, variously translated, sets out the fundamental principle: : The best way [Great Way, the Tao] is not difficult : It only excludes picking and choosing : Once you stop loving and hating : It will enlighten itself. : (trans. D. Pajin) Alternatively: : The Perfect Way knows no difficulties : Except that it refuses to make preferences; : Only when freed from hate and love, : It reveals itself fully and without disguise : (trans. by D.T. Suzuki)Suzuki (1960), pp. 76-82; see also, Soeng (2004), pp. 133, 139, 145, 151, 157, 163, 169. ===Last verse=== The poem ends with: : Emptiness here, Emptiness there, : but the infinite universe stands always before your eyes. : Infinitely large and infinitely small; : no difference, for definitions have vanished : and no boundaries are seen. : So too with Being : and non-Being. : Don't waste time in doubts and arguments : that have nothing to do with this. : One thing, all things: : move among and intermingle, without distinction. : To live in this realization : is to be without anxiety about non-perfection. : To live in this faith is the road to non-duality, : Because the non-dual is one with the trusting mind. : Words! The Way is beyond language, : for in it there is :: no yesterday :: no tomorrow :: no today. :(trans. Richard B. Clarke) Alternatively: : One in All, : All in One-- : If only this is realized, : No more worry about your not being perfect! :Where Mind and each believing mind are not divided, :And undivided are each believing mind and Mind, :This is where words fail; :For it is not of the past, present, and future. :(trans.
