    "text": "\"Da Coconut Nut\" is a song by Filipino National Artist Ryan Cayabyab originally popularized by the band Smokey Mountain in 1991. Philippine Daily Inquirer editor Rito Asilo characterized the song as a \"wackily irreverent novelty hit\". In July 2017, footage of a performance of the song by the 75-member Baylor University School of Music Men's Choir from the United States in an Emirates Airlines plane cabin before passengers and flight crew was posted online and became popular. == Composition == The song's lyrics describe the many uses of the different parts of a coconut tree. Cayabyab, in an interview with ABS-CBN, said that the song was composed in the novelty style as originally popularized by Yoyoy Villame, who at times the song was incorrectly attributed to. Khmer Times described the song as a \"whimsical Filipino piece.\" When the song was performed during Barack Obama's visit to the Philippines, Rappler described the song as a \"classic ditty\". == Performance == The song became part of the concert programs of choirs in United States after a deal in July 2008 allowed its publication in the choral arrangement in Randy Stenson's Santa Barbara Music Publishing of California catalogue and performed in the American Choral Directors National Convention. Stenson first heard the song performed by a Hawaiian choir. Cayabyab claimed that the song became popular among American choirs ever since. In July 2017, when a video of the Baylor University School of Music Men's Choir performing the song before airline crew and passengers in Emirates Airlines' plane cabin became popular, the choir stated that it had actually been singing the song since 2010. == References == Category:Philippine songs Category:Songs about trees ",
