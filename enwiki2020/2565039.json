It is located adjacent to Los Angeles Valley College. It is part of District North 2 of the Los Angeles Unified School District. The school serves several areas, including Valley Glen, much of Sherman Oaks, and sections of both Van Nuys and North Hollywood. Its mascot is the Lancer and the school colors are brown, orange, and white. The school motto is: \"What we are to be we are now becoming.\" The school newspaper is called The Odyssey in reference to President Grant's first name - Ulysses - the main character in Homer's epic The Odyssey. There is a school tradition that, on or about April 1, a satirical issue is distributed called the \"Oddity\", which contains comical and irreverent articles. Past \"articles\" have been about finals being canceled, the school being closed, rats infesting the cafeteria, clothing-optional P.E. classes, etc. The school yearbook is called The Shield. Connected to Grant High School is a communications/technology magnet which emphasizes smaller class sizes and communications technology electives including film/video production, broadcast journalism, computer technology, graphic communications, and performing arts. == History == Grant opened as a high school in September 1959. Grant's original purpose was to serve as a high school for the families of World War II veterans who were moving into the San Fernando Valley. Its first students were baby boomers moving into suburban houses in the Valley.Jefferson, David J. \"The Divorce Generation Grows Up.\" Newsweek. April 12, 2008. Retrieved on January 4, 2016. Reut Cohen of Neon Tommy, a publication of the Annenberg Media Center, wrote that in the 1970s and 1980s the school was \"regarded as an excellent public institution.\"Cohen, Reut. \"Grant High's Novinger Uses Empathy To Help Keep The Peace\" (Archive). Neon Tommy, Annenberg Media Center. January 6, 2011. Retrieved on January 5, 2016. In the 1990s there was ethnic tension between the Armenian students and the Hispanic and Latino students. An LAUSD official stated a belief that the tension may have originated from earthquake relief drives held in the 1980s which were meant to benefit Armenia and Mexico.Sauerwein, Kristina. \"Ethnic Tension Blamed for Grant High Melee.\" Los Angeles Times. October 23, 1999. Retrieved on January 4, 2016. Cohen stated that the ethnic tensions were a major factor in the decline of Grant's reputation in the 1990s. The tensions exploded on October 21, 1999 when a fight between an Armenian girl and a Latina girl turned into a fight among 200 students. The fight resulted in 40 students being detained and minor injuries being inflicted on 10 students, some teachers, and a maintenance worker. No serious injuries occurred. In January 2000 the students signed a \"peace treaty\" to prevent future fighting. By February banners were erected which promoted peace.Briggs, Johnathon E. \"Banners Seek to Prevent Rips in the Social Fabric.\" Los Angeles Times. February 11, 2000. Retrieved on January 4, 2016. By October of that year there were discussion programs aimed at further reducing tension.MacGregor, Hillary E. \"Program Seeks to Reduce Latino-Armenian Tensions at School.\" Los Angeles Times.

Grant was featured in Newsweek magazine's April 17, 2008 cover story about 25 years of divorce in America; Grant was chosen as a prototypical suburban high school and the article featured members of the class of 1982 and their marital stories. == Academic and artistic feats == In the late 1960s, a local L.A. television station aired a game show called It's Academic, which featured competition among L.A. area high schools in a quiz show format. Grant won the competition both years that the show was on the air.
