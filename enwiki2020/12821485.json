    "text": "Blood Wedding () is a 1981 Spanish musical film written and directed by Carlos Saura. It was directed and choreographed in the flamenco style. It is the first part of Saura's 1980s flamenco trilogy, and is followed by Carmen (1983) and El amor brujo (1986). The film depicts Antonio Gades and his dance company performing a flamenco adaptation of Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca's play Blood Wedding. As with all Saura's flamenco films, the film is overtly theatrical: it begins with the company arriving at the studio and putting on costumes and makeup. The dance is then performed in a bare windowed space with a minimum of props and no set. There are no elaborate costumes and many of the actors wear only their rehearsal clothes. It was shown out of competition at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival. ==Cast== *Antonio Gades as Leonardo *Cristina Hoyos as Bride *Juan Antonio Jim\u00e9nez as Groom *Pilar C\u00e1rdenas as Mother *Carmen Villena as Wife ==References== == External links == * Category:1981 films Category:Spanish films Category:Spanish-language films Category:Films directed by Carlos Saura Category:1980s musical films Category:Flamenco films Category:1980s dance films ",
