Slonimsky, Ed., Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians, 8th ed., Schirmer Books, NY ==Life== Gevaert kept a journal while travelling through different countries. This is an excerpt from the manuscript \"Journey to Spain\", 1850-1852. His father was a baker, and he was intended for the same profession, but better counsels prevailed and he was permitted to study music. He was sent in 1841 to the Ghent Conservatory, where he studied under \u00c9douard de Sommere and Martin-Joseph Mengal. Then he was appointed organist of the Jesuit church in that city. Soon Gevaert's compositions attracted attention, and he won the Belgian Prix de Rome which entitled him to two years' travel. The journey was postponed during the production of his first opera and other works. He finally embarked on it in 1849. After a short stay in Paris he went to Spain, and subsequently to Italy. In 1867 Gevaert, having returned to Paris, became \"Chef de Chant\" at the Academie de Musique there, in succession to the popular operatic composer Fromental Hal\u00e9vy. Four years later, he was appointed head of the Brussels Conservatoire. In that role, he \"exerted a far- reaching influence through his historical concerts, producing works of all nations and periods.\" Though during his lifetime Gevaert's own music enjoyed considerable success in Belgium (it included no fewer than a dozen operas, two of which were Quentin Durward and Le Capitaine Henriot), it is now forgotten, save for some of his choral pieces, which have recently been issued on CD by the Fuga Libera label. Nowadays he is mostly remembered, even in his native land, less as a composer than as a teacher, historian, and lecturer. His many prose writings include a Treatise on Instrumentation (still sometimes used today), a book on harmony, and a Vade Mecum for organists. Notable students of Gevaert included Alfred Wotquenne, who is best known for having provided the first thorough listing of C.P.E. Bach's compositions, whilst Gevaert's daughter Jacqueline Marthe married the singer and art historian Hippolyte Fierens-Gevaert. == Honours == * 1881: Grand Officier in the Order of Leopold.Handelsblad (Het) 17-05-1881 * 1896:Grand Cordon in the Order of Leopold.Laatste Nieuws (Het) 17-05-1896 == Selected works == * Te Deum (1843) * Ouverture Flandre au lion (1848) * Fantasia sobre motivos espa\u00f1oles (1850) * Requiem (1853) * Vers l'avenir (1905) * Grand' Messe de No\u00ebl Puer Natus est Nobis (1907) * Quartet for clarinet, horn, bassoon and piano Operas *Georgette, ou le moulin de Fontenoy (1853) * Le billet de Marguerite (1854) * Les lavandi\u00e8res de Santarem (1855) * Quentin Durward (1858) * Le diable au moulin (1859) * La Ch\u00e2teau Trompette (1860) * Le Capitane Henriot (1864) Secular Cantatas * Belgi\u00eb (1847) * Le roi L\u00e9ar (1847) * \u00c9vocation patriotique (1856) * De nationale verjaerdag (1857) * Le retour de l'arm\u00e9e (1859) * Jacob van Artevelde (1864) ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Category:1828 births Category:1908 deaths Category:19th-century classical composers Category:20th-century classical composers Category:Belgian classical composers Category:Belgian male classical composers Category:Romantic composers Category:Belgian opera composers Category:Male opera composers Category:Belgian music educators Category:Prix de Rome (Belgium) winners Category:People from Oudenaarde Category:Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class) Category:20th-century male musicians Category:19th-century male musicians ",
