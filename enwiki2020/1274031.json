    "text": "Sample from an 8th-century evangelary in the Merovingian script Merovingian script or Gallo-Roman script was a medieval variant of the Latin script so called because it was developed in Gaul during the Merovingian dynasty. It was used in the 7th and 8th centuries before the Carolingian dynasty and the development of Carolingian minuscule. ==Script types== There were four major centres of Merovingian script: the monasteries of Luxeuil, Laon, Corbie, and Chelles. Each script developed from uncial, half-uncial, and the Merovingian charter scripts. ===Luxeuil=== National Library of France, written in the Luxeuil type. The folio's content consists of Acts 5:17-25. Tempore illo exsur- / gens autem princeps sacerdotum: et omnes / qui cum illo erant\u00b7 quae est heresis sadducaeorum\u00b7... The Luxeuil type uses distinctive long, slim capital letters as a display script. These capitals have wedge-shaped finials, and the crossbar of \u27e8a\u27e9 resembles a small letter \u27e8v\u27e9 while that of \u27e8h\u27e9 is a wavy line. The letter \u27e8o\u27e9 is often written as a diamond shape, with a smaller \u27e8o\u27e9 written inside. The letter \u27e8a\u27e9 resembles two \u27e8c\u27e9s (\"cc\"), and because of this distinctive feature the Luxeuil type is sometimes called \"a type\". The letter \u27e8b\u27e9 often has an open bowl and an arm connecting it to the following letter, the letter \u27e8d\u27e9 can have either a vertical ascender or an ascender slanted to the left; \u27e8i\u27e9 is often very tall, resembling l; \u27e8n\u27e9 can be written with an uncial form (similar to a capital \u27e8N\u27e9); \u27e8o\u27e9 is often drop-shaped and has a line connecting it to the next letter; and \u27e8t\u27e9 has a loop extending to the left of its top stroke. The letter \u27e8t\u27e9 is also used in numerous ligatures where it has many other forms. The letters \u27e8e\u27e9 and \u27e8r\u27e9 are also quite often found in ligature. ===Laon=== The Laon type has thicker display capitals than the Luxeuil type. Capital initial letters are often decorated with animals, and there are many ligatures with the letter \u27e8i\u27e9. Like Visigothic script, there are two different \u27e8ti\u27e9 ligatures, representing two different sounds (\"hard\" and \"soft\"). The letters \u27e8d\u27e9 and \u27e8q\u27e9 often have open bowls. The letter a is unique, resembling two sharp points (\"<<\"), and the letter \u27e8z\u27e9, uncommon in Latin, is nevertheless very distinctive in the Laon type, with a flourish projecting upwards to the left, above the line. Because of these features, Laon type is sometimes called \"a-z type\". ===Corbie=== The Corbie type as used in the 8th century, was based on uncial and the Luxeuil type, but was also similar to half-uncial and insular script, with elements of Roman cursive. It is sometimes called \"eN-type\", as the letter \u27e8e\u27e9 has a high, open upper loop, and the uncial form of the letter \u27e8n\u27e9 (resembling majuscule \u27e8N\u27e9) is very frequently used. After the mid-8th century, the letter (a) also has an open loop and resembles the letter \u27e8u\u27e9; this type is referred to as \"eNa-type\". A more distinctive type was developed at Corbie in the 9th century, the \"a-b type\". The letter \u27e8b\u27e9 is similar to Luxeuil type, but the letter \u27e8a\u27e9 has a straight first stroke, resembling a combination of \u27e8i\u27e9 and \u27e8c\u27e9. This type was used from the end of the 8th century until the mid-9th century. The Liber glossarum, a major medieval reference work, was written in the \"a-b type\" script of Corbie. ===Chelles=== The Chelles type was similar to the Luxeuil a-b type. Other features include the uncial \u27e8N\u27e9, with strokes leaning to the left; the letter d with an ascender leaning to the left; the letter \u27e8g\u27e9 with a descender resembling the letter \u27e8s\u27e9; the letter \u27e8s\u27e9 with a very small top loop; and the letter \u27e8x\u27e9 with the two strokes crossing near the top of the line rather than the middle. ==Development== There was also a Merovingian cursive script, used in charters and non-religious writings. All of these types were later influenced by Carolingian script, which eventually replaced it entirely. Along with resemblances to Carolingian and Visigothic, Merovingian shares some features with Beneventan script. ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * Category:Latin-script calligraphy Script Category:Medieval scripts Category:Western calligraphy ",
