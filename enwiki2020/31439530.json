He was one of several youth activists involved in the latter actions, along with John Lewis, William Barbee, Paul Brooks, Charles Butler, Allen Cason, Catherine Burks, and Lucretia Collins.Arsenault, Raymond. Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice. Oxford UP, 2006. Print. 102, 185 ==Early life and education== Harbour was born into a black family, on January 9, 1942, in Piedmont, Alabama.Dr. William E. Harbour-1942-2020-Obituary His father was a cotton mill worker at the Standard Coosa Thatcher mill and the owner of the OK Barbershop \u2014 Piedmont\u2019s only black barbershop \u2014, while his mother worked as a cook to local white families. Although his father hoped that he would take over the barbershop, Harbour was determined to become the first person in his family to attend college. Following a rejection by Jacksonville State University in 1960, he was able to fulfill this dream upon admission to Tennessee State University the following year. ==Civil Rights activism== thumb Soon after arriving in Tennessee, Harbour joined the Student Central Committee of the Nashville Christian Leadership Council at the behest of John Lewis, a fellow activist and close friend (the two had met on a bus ride to a rally in Rock Hill, South Carolina). While at the university, he participated in numerous acts of civil disobedience, including \"sit-in, stand-in, picketing and marching activities as a function of the civil rights movement.\" His activism brought him to Rock Hill, SC where he served jail time with other students imprisoned after a lunch counter sit-in. Out of a large number of volunteers, Harbour was one of only a few selected to take part in the first Freedom Rides; other participants included seven blacks \u2014 John Lewis, William Barbee, Paul Brooks, Charles Butler, Allen Cason Jr., Catherine Burks and Lucretia Collins \u2014, and two whites \u2014 James Zwerg and Salynn McCollum. Harbour\u2019s involvement led to him being arrested twice in rapid succession. The first arrest occurred in Montgomery at the tail end of a Nashville (17 May) \u2013 Montgomery (21 May) Freedom Ride. The second arrest occurred on 28 May 1961 at the end of a Nashville (via Memphis) \u2013 Jackson, Mississippi Freedom Ride, and resulted in Harbour being imprisoned for 30 days. In Montgomery, Harbour was the first activist to exit the bus as it arrived at the Montgomery Greyhound Bus Station \u2014 and thus the first to encounter the waiting mob. Although he survived the resultant riot (and subsequent imprisonment in Jackson), upon return to Tennessee he and 14 other students were expelled from Tennessee State University due to their involvement in the civil rights movement. While Harbour\u2019s difficulties were far from unique, the pattern of \"brutality and jail terms\" which he and his fellow activists encountered not only strengthened the Freedom Riders\u2019 resolve, but also increased publicity and motivated others to join them. ==After the Freedom Ride== Following his expulsion from Tennessee State University, Harbour\u2019s mother advised him against returning to Piedmont due to fear for his safety. Consequently, from 1961 to 1966 he made only \"one brief visit\" home. In late 1961, Harbour was reinstated to Tennessee State University. After a short stint as a Georgia school teacher, and a period of involvement in the \"War on Poverty\" under President Johnson, he became a federal civil servant \"specializing in U.S. Army base closings\". Residing in Atlanta, Georgia, Harbour remained \"an active alumnus\" of Tennessee State University. The Atlanta Alumni Association sponsors a scholarship named in his honor, The William E. Harbour Academic Scholarship. ==References== Category:1942 births Category:2020 deaths Category:People from Piedmont, Alabama Category:American civil rights activists Category:Activists for African-American civil rights Category:Tennessee State University alumni Category:Freedom Riders Category:Activists from Alabama ",
