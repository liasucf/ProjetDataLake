The town is located 55 kilometres southwest of Whang\u0101rei. It is noted for the high proportion of residents of Croatian descent. The area around it is one of the chief regions in the country for cultivating kumara (sweet potato) and so Dargaville is known by many locals as the Kumara Capital of New Zealand. ==History and culture== Gumdigger statue at Dargaville The town was named after timber merchant and politician Joseph Dargaville (1837\u20131896). Founded during the 19th-century kauri gum and timber trade, it briefly had New Zealand's largest population. The area became known for a thriving industry that included gum digging and kauri logging, which was based mainly at Te K\u014dpuru, several kilometres south of Dargaville on the banks of the Northern Wairoa river. The river was used to transport the huge logs downstream to shipbuilders and as a primary means of transport to Auckland. Dalmatian migrants were particularly prominent in the kauri gum extraction. Te Houhanga Marae and R\u0101hiri meeting house is a traditional meeting place for Te Roroa and the Ng\u0101ti Wh\u0101tua hap\u016b of Te Kuihi and Te Roroa. ==Demographics== Dargaville had a population of 4,794 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 543 people (12.8%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 339 people (7.6%) since the 2006 census.

This beach is home of the famous local shellfish delicacy called the toheroa. Overexploitation in the 1950s and 1960s caused the population of the shellfish to decline enough that public gathering of the shellfish is now prohibited. Dargaville is also the gateway to the Waipoua Forest, a protected national park and home of the biggest specimens of Kauri tree in New Zealand, T\u0101ne Mahuta (M\u0101ori, meaning \"Lord of the Forest\") being chief amongst them. Dargaville is situated by the Wairoa River, with boat moorings adjacent to the town centre.

North of the town, the Donnellys Crossing Section railway was established to provide access to other logging activities. The first portion of this line was opened in 1889, it reached its greatest extent in 1923, and after operating isolated from the national rail network for decades, it was connected with the North Auckland Line by the Dargaville Branch in 1940. The Donnelly's Crossing Section closed in 1959, but the Dargaville Branch remains in use by a tourist venture, having been closed by KiwiRail since October 2014. The area around Dargaville is now predominantly a farming region and supports extensive dairy, beef, and sheep farms, as well as a thriving plantation forest industry.
