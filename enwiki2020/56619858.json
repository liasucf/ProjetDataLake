Even though very rude and stubborn at the beginning, Radha opens up to Aditya as the movie progresses. Radha teaches him various aspects of cooking like shopping for vegetables, cleaning utensils etc. Together they start a service called 'Dial-A- Chef' where they go to people's house and cook them a meal. Aditya still is conflicted about whether to tell his family about his plans to start a restaurant and his passion for food, when he is confronted by his fiancee, who wants him to continue being a banker. It is later revealed that Radha had been in coma for 11 years and cooking is all she remembers. She becomes fond of Aditya. She becomes really angry when she finds out about Aditya's plans to go to London and start a restaurant. But she later realises that she has to let him go. == Cast == *Siddharth Chandekar as Aditya Naik *Sonali Kulkarni as Radha Agarkar * Madhura Deshpande as Neha *Chinmay Udgirkar as Amey * Mahesh Ghag as Popat * Mohanabai as Rukmini Mavshi * Priya Bapat as London Hotel Customer (cameo) == References == == External links == * *\u092e\u0930\u093e\u0920\u0940 \u0916\u093e\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0938\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0915\u0943\u0924\u0940\u091a\u0902 \u0924\u093e\u091f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0915\u093e\u0902\u0938\u092e\u094b\u0930 \u0906\u0923\u0923\u093e\u0930\u093e \u0917\u0941\u0932\u093e\u092c\u091c\u093e\u092e Category:2018 films Category:Indian comedy-drama films Category:Indian films Category:2018 comedy- drama films Category:2010s Marathi-language films ",
