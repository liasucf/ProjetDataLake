    "text": "The Pyramids were a surf group from Long Beach, California, United States, who formed in 1961.AllMusic - The Pyramids, Artist biography by Richie Unterberger August 10, 2011 (Retrieved August 10, 2011) In early 1964, they made the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 with their instrumental \"Penetration\". It proved to be the final major instrumental surf hit. ==History== The band started in 1961 and was made up of five students from Poly High. All of them played some rock n roll. The members were Skip Mercier on lead and rhythm guitar, Ron McMullen on drums, Tom Pitman on sax, Willie Glover on rhythm guitar and Steve Leonard on bass. The group got their first break at a San Bernardino dance which a local radio station had sponsored. After the show some of the dancers and deejays suggested that they record an infectious number that people would like to hear repeated. Steve Leonard composed a number which was to become \"Penetration\".The Red Scare, Ufos & Elvis: Long Beach Enters the Atomic Age, By Claudine Burnett - Rock 'N' Roll ==Career== The group was approached by John Hodge who offered to manage and record them. He took them to Garrison Studios in Long Beach and they cut two sides. The singe \"Pyramid's Stomp\" only sold a handful of copies due to the lack of promotion and airplay. After that they played the record hops and school dances. They recorded a single with \"Here Comes Marsha\" as the A side and the \"Penetration\" as the B side. It was originally called \"Eyeballs\", it was based on \"Pipeline\" by The Chantays.One Hit Wonders, A Musical Review - Golden Hits Of The 60s\u201d, PYRAMIDS, PENETRATION It's possible that the interest in \"Penetration\" started due to a Riverside DJ not playing the Will Glover composed A side \"Here Comes Marsha\" but instead playing the flip side \"Penetration\".Long Beach Post, January 29, 2016 The Pyramids, Stompin' with The Pyramids, Long Beach's Legendary Surf Band: Guitarist Will Glover Remembers by Matt Cohn With this single, their manager Hodge managed to secure local airplay.
