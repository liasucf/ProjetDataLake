The university is the largest degree-granting institution in Bismarck. It has study abroad campuses in Rome and Arequipa, Peru, and also operates academic programs at satellite locations in North Dakota (Fargo, downtown Bismarck, Watford City, Grand Forks), Minnesota, Montana, Kansas, and Arizona. It is endorsed by The Newman Guide to Choosing a Catholic College.\"University of Mary\", Newman Society ==History== The first Benedictine sisters to arrive in Bismarck, ND The Priory and University of Mary grew from a boarding school founded in Bismarck in 1878 by four Benedictine sisters. In 1944, the sisters formed the Convent of the Annunciation. In 1947 it was renamed Annunciation Priory. ===First Buildings=== Architect Marcel Breuer designed the college's original campus (c. 1955) In the early 1950s, Annunciation Priory requested that modernist architect Marcel Breuer design a new campus. At the time, Breuer was finishing the new abbey and several university buildings at Saint John's Abbey, Collegeville in Minnesota. In 1955, Breuer accepted the commission only after visiting the site, meeting with the sisters, and being \"overwhelmed by the power and presence of the landscape setting and the mission.\" Breuer's designs used native granite prairie stone, complex concrete shapes, and a juxtaposition light and shadow. The first buildings were a convent, dining hall, and classrooms. The school was officially founded as a women's college in 1959 as Mary College. Our Lady of the Annunciation Chapel was consecrated in 1963 in the second phase of construction. As the school grew, it endeavored to preserve the spirit of Breuer's modernist prairie architecture while implementing new programs and new buildings by lesser-known architects. === Coeducation and University Status === Mary College rapidly expanded and became fully co-educational in the 1960s. It achieved university status \u2014 becoming the University of Mary \u2014 in 1986. The University of Mary is the only private, Catholic university in North Dakota. It has been accredited by the Higher Learning Commission since 1969. Since its incorporation in 1959, the university's enrollment has grown from 69 to more than 3,800. Its undergraduate programs have grown from nursing and education to 65+ degrees, ranging from accounting to Catholic studies. In 1986, the university began offering master's degrees in nursing, management, and education. It has added master's programs in business administration, counseling, occupational therapy, physical therapy, public administration, project management, clinical exercise physiology, kinesiology, speech-language pathology, music, Catholic studies, and bioethics. Doctorates are currently offered in education, nursing, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. ===2000 and later=== In 2001, the University of Mary unveiled its vision as \"America's Leadership University.\" In 2005, the master's degree in physical therapy was replaced by a Doctor of Physical Therapy \u2014 the university's first doctorate. The first 26 candidates in this program received their entry-level clinical doctorate in 2006. Since then, doctorates have been added in Education, Nursing, and Occupational Therapy. The University of Mary has expanded options in order to make education accessible to working adults and to support lifelong learning in the region and beyond. The University of Mary Online offers accelerated undergraduate and graduate programs for the adult learner.

Since 2005, the University of Mary has offered bachelor's and master's programs online. In 2006, UMary initiated the Gary Tharaldson School of Business. Named for Gary Tharaldson, a North Dakota hospitality entrepreneur and industry innovator, the new school was designed to bridge the gap between the academic and business world. The flagship facility that houses the Gary Tharaldson School opened in September 2008. From the fall of 2009 to the Spring of 2010, the University of Mary searched for a facility as the base for its Rome, Italy program. It found one a ten-minute bus ride from the city center. The first students to study in this Rome program left the United States in the Fall of 2010. The Catholic Studies Program, an initiative of UMary President Monsignor James P. Shea, was also launched in the fall of 2010. On October 19, 2010, the program was named in honor of Bishop Paul Albert Zipfel, sixth bishop of the Diocese of Bismarck, North Dakota. The Catholic Studies Program is an interdisciplinary program designed to explore the Catholic Church's contributions to and influence on human thought and culture, past and present. The program invites students of any faith who wish to deepen their knowledge of Catholicism's rich history and living tradition. With a full-time faculty and staff of more than 300, the University of Mary remains committed to continuing the mission of its founding Sisters: serving the people of the region in a spirit that fosters servant-leadership, preparing leaders in the service of truth. ==Campus== A portion of the University of Mary's main campus, seen from the east, overlooking the Missouri River valley The University of Mary is a rural campus located about south of Bismarck and was built on a high prairie bluff overlooking the \"Capital City.\" The campus includes 24 buildings.
