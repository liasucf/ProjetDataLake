There's no fluid feel...as a whole this definitely falls short of any of their solo work.\" RapReviews - \"...Most rap groups who made great albums needed guidance to make those great albums. The Criminalz definitely lack a mastermind to weld the three of them together and make them realize their synergies...There are almost no ad-libs, there's no interacting, it might as well be that these three never were in the same studio together...\" == Track listing == == Chart history == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (2001) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Independent Albums |align=\"center\"|26 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums |align=\"center\"|57 |} == Personnel == * Bernard Freeman \u2013 performer (track 5) * Doyle \u2013 producer (tracks: 4-6, 8-10, 12) * \"G-Man\" Stan Keith \u2013 producer (tracks: 2-3, 11), mixing & recording * James Savage \u2013 performer (tracks: 3-4, 6-7, 9-11) * Jerold Dwight Ellis III \u2013 performer (track 7) * Joi Patrice - background vocals (track 6) * J.R. - background vocals (tracks: 8, 10) * La'Mar Lorraine Johnson \u2013 performer (track 8) * Marcellus McCarver \u2013 performer (tracks: 2-6, 8-12), executive producer * Robert Lee Green, Jr. \u2013 performer (tracks: 3-12), producer (track 7) * Tracy Lamar Davis \u2013 performer (track 7) == References == == External links == * [ Criminal Activity] at Allmusic * Criminal Activity at Discogs * Criminal Activity at MusicBrainz * Criminal Activity at Tower Records Category:Spice 1 albums Category:Celly Cel albums Category:2001 debut albums Category:Criminalz albums Category:Jayo Felony albums ",
