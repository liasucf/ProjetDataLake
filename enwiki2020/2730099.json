    "text": "Beatallica (known by fans as The Grey Album) is the second E.P. from Beatallica. It contains eight tracks, made from combinations of Beatles and Metallica songs. The gray color of the album cover is a reference to both The Beatles and Metallica's self-titled albums (the former being white and the latter being black). \"Blackened the USSR\", \"Sandman\", \"Leper Madonna\" and \"Hey Dude\" were re-recorded for the band's first full-length album Sgt. Hetfield's Motorbreath Pub Band. \"And I'm Evil\", \"Got to Get You Trapped Under Ice\" and \"I Want to Choke Your Band\" were re-recorded for their second album Masterful Mystery Tour. ==Track listing== #Blackened the USSR #*Musical References: #** \"Blackened\" #** \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" #** \"Hey Jude\" #*Lyrical References: #**\"Hit the Lights\" #**Lemmy from the band Mot\u00f6rhead #Sandman #*Lyrical References: #**\"Seek and Destroy\" #**Don Dokken/Dokken #And I'm Evil #*Lyrical References: #**\"Ain't My Bitch\" #**\"Die, Die My Darling\" #**\"20 Eyes\" #**The Misfits (Jaymz Lennfield mimics Glenn Danzig's voice, providing backing vocals halfway through the song) #Got to Get You Trapped Under Ice #*Lyrical References: #**MTV #**Bananarama #Leper Madonna #*Musical References: #**Contains a sample from the infamous online faux-copy of Madonna's American Life #*Lyrical References: #**\"Like a Virgin\" #**\"Like a Prayer\" #**\"Orion\" #Hey Dude #*Musical References: #**\"Nothing Else Matters\" #*Lyrical References: #**\"Sad but True\" #**\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" #**\"Eye of the Beholder\" #**Diamond Head #**Kip Winger #**New wave of British heavy metal #**\"Flying V\" Guitars #I Want to Choke Your Band #*Lyrical References: #**Don't Tread on Me #**C.
