They follow the vegan straight edge philosophy and are one of the first Latin American hardcore punk bands to tour the world. Nueva \u00c9tica's music has been described as a mix of Hatebreed and Terror. == History == === Formation and Momento de la Verdad (1998-2001) === Nueva \u00c9tica was formed in 1998 by members of other hardcore bands from Buenos Aires, including Vieja escuela, Autocontrol and Sudarshana. They began with three singers in the tradition of Path of Resistance and Point of No Return. A year later, they released their first work entitled Momento de la Verdad, which gained a good reputation in the Brazilian hardcore scene. In 1999 they toured Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. === La Venganza de los Justos (2002-2005) === In 2002, the band released their second work La Venganza de los Justos. For this album, Nueva \u00c9tica replaced one of their vocalists with a new member, but shortly after recording it they returned to the original line-up. La Venganza de los Justos was issued in Latin America, the United States, Japan and Europe. In 2003, the band toured Europe for the first time, including performances at Ieperfest (Belgium) and Fluff Fest (Czech Republic). === Inquebrantable (2006-2008) === Nueva \u00c9tica released Inquebrantable in 2006 after five months of recording in the MCP Studio of Mart\u00edn Carrizo (drummer of the band A.N.I.M.A.L.), who was in charge of its recording and sound, as well as participating as a guest musician. The production, mixing and mastering was done at Tue Madsen's AntFarm Studios in Denmark. Inquebrantable was distributed in Brazil by Liberaci\u00f3n Records, in Argentina by Vegan Records, in the United States by New Eden Records and in Europe by Alveran. The online magazine Laut.de compared it with Hatebreed and Terror. The band embarked on a world tour to promote the album, starting in South America (Chile and Brazil) and then playing 58 tour dates in Europe, featuring appearances at Fluff Fest and Pressure Festival in Germany. In 2007, the band returned to Buenos Aires, playing with Caliban, Terror and again Heaven Shall Burn. Later they toured through Hispanic America. === 3L1T3 and Esto es Sudam\u00e9rica (2008-2012) === In 2008, Nueva \u00c9tica celebrated its 10th anniversary with a sold-out show at El Teatro Colegiales in Buenos Aires. That year, they released their fourth album 3L1T3, produced by Tue Madsen and featuring Mart\u00edn Carrizo on drums and a guest appearance by Scott Vogel of Terror. They released a music video for \"El Tiempo es Ahora\" (The Time is Now) from the album, which highlights alarming statistics of the growing use of drugs and alcohol in Argentina. In 2014, \"El Tiempo es Ahora\" had reached over 200,000 views on YouTube. By 2009, Nueva \u00c9tica became the most listened heavy metal and hard rock band from Argentina on MySpace, surpassing artists such as Rata Blanca and Carajo. In May 2012, Nueva \u00c9tica released the DVD This is South America via Seven Eight Life Recordings, recorded in 2010 in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil and including videos of other international performances. === Hiatus and reunion (2013-present) === Nueva \u00c9tica entered a hiatus around 2013 in which the band members took different musical and personal paths.
