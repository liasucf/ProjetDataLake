Gencebay was born in the coastal town of Samsun on 4 August 1944. He is of Crimean Tatar descent. In 1998, he was named a State Artist of Turkey. ==Career== At ages 20 and 22, he passed the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT) auditions and became a resident ba\u011flama player at the network for several months. In 1966, he was one of the primary contestants in National Ba\u011flama Contest with Arif Sa\u011f and Cinu\u00e7en Tanr\u0131korur, two other contemporary masters of Turkish music. In the late sixties, he collaborated with a wide range of musicians in performances and film music. Between 1966 and 1968, he played ba\u011flama with Arif Sa\u011f in many records with singers such as Muzaffer Akg\u00fcn, Y\u0131ld\u0131z Tezcan, G\u00fclden Karab\u00f6cek, Ahmet Sezgin, \u015e\u00fckran Ay, Sabahat Akkiraz, and Nuri Sesig\u00fczel. Gencebay also took part as a music director in many Turkish films such as Ana, Kuyu, K\u0131z\u0131l\u0131rmak-Karakoyun. He also collaborated with many musicians from different genres, such as Erkin Koray, Omar Faruk Tekbilek, Ismet Siral, Burhan Tonguc, Ozer Senay, Vedat Yildirimbora, Ne\u015fet Erta\u015f, Abdullah Nail Bay\u015fu. He appeared as a baglama performer and a well-known composer in musical societies, besides releasing several singles in genre of traditional Turkish folk music. In 1968, he released his first \"free-style\" single \"Sensiz Bahar Gecmiyor/Basa Gelen Cekilirmis\", and was rewarded. During the 1970s, he released many singles in a new genre that is a fusion of traditional Turkish folk music, Turkish classical music, Western classical music, jazz, rock, country, progressive, psychedelic, Indian, Arabic, Spanish, and Greek music styles. Even though some musical societies such as TRT named that kind of World fusion music recordings Arabesque music, Orhan Gencebay refused the term arabesque, saying it was inadequate to define his style. In 1972, he founded the Kervan Record Company, attracting many other talented musicians such as Erkin Koray, Ajda Pekkan, Muazzez Abac\u0131, Mustafa Sa\u011fya\u015far, Ahmet \u00d6zhan, Kamuran Akkor, Semiha Yank\u0131, Samime Sanay, Ne\u015fe Karab\u00f6cek, Bedia Akart\u00fcrk, Nil Burak, Ziya Ta\u015fkent, Semiramis Pekkan and Ferdi \u00d6zbe\u011fen. Throughout his career, Orhan has performed leading roles in 36 movies, has been a composer almost in 90 movies, composed of about a thousand works, released almost 35 singles, 15 albums, and dozens of MCs. His albums sold out over 65 million legal copies. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== == Filmography == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- ! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:LightSteelBlue\" | Cinema |- !style=\"background:#CCCCCC\"| Year !style=\"background:#CCCCCC\"| Title !style=\"background:#CCCCCC\"| Role !style=\"background:#CCCCCC\"| Notes |- | 1971 || Bir Teselli Ver ||Orhan ||Orhan Gencebay's cinematic debut. |- |1972 |Sev Dedi G\u00f6zlerim |Orhan | |- |1973 |Ben Do\u011farken \u00d6lm\u00fc\u015f\u00fcm |Orhan | |- |1974 |Dertler Benim Olsun |Sebahattin | |- |rowspan=\"2\"| 1975 || Bats\u0131n Bu D\u00fcnya ||Orhan || |- |Bir Araya Gelemeyiz ||Orhan || |- | rowspan=\"2\" |1976 |B\u0131kt\u0131m Her G\u00fcn \u00d6lmekten || Orhan || |- |\u015eof\u00f6r ||Haydar || |- | rowspan=\"1\" | 1977 ||Hatas\u0131z Kul Olmaz || Orhan Akman || |- | rowspan=\"3\" | 1978 || Derdim D\u00fcnyadan B\u00fcy\u00fck || Orhan|| |- |\u00c7ileke\u015f ||Himself || |- |A\u015fk\u0131 Ben Mi Yaratt\u0131m ||Himself|| |- |1979 |Yarabbim || Orhan|| |- | rowspan=\"3\" | 1980 || K\u0131r G\u00f6nl\u00fcn\u00fcn Zincirini ||Orhan Gencebay || |- |Vazge\u00e7 G\u00f6nl\u00fcm || Orhan|| |- |Ben Topraktan Bir Can\u0131m || Orhan || |- |1981 ||Feryada G\u00fcc\u00fcm Yok || Orhan Gencebay || |- | rowspan=\"3\" | 1982 || K\u00f6rd\u00fc\u011f\u00fcm || Orhan|| |- |Bir Yudum Mutluluk || Orhan|| |- |Leyla \u0130le Mecnun ||Kadir || |- | rowspan=\"2\" | 1983 || Zul\u00fcm || Orhan|| |- |Kah\u0131r || Orhan|| |- | rowspan=\"3\" | 1984 || Kaptan || Orhan|| |- |Dil Yaras\u0131 ||Orhan || |- |A\u015fk\u0131m G\u00fcnah\u0131md\u0131r || Orhan Gencebay|| |- |1985 ||Doruk || Orhan || |- | 1987 ||Cennet G\u00f6zl\u00fcm || Orhan || |- | 1988 ||K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fcks\u00fcn Yavrum || Orhan || |- | rowspan=\"2\" |1989 |Sensiz Ya\u015f\u0131yorum ||Orhan Gencebay || |- |Kan \u00c7i\u00e7e\u011fi |Orhan | |- |1990 ||Utan ||Orhan ||Orhan Gencebay's last movie appearance. |} ;Movie soundtracks * K\u0131z\u0131l\u0131rmak-Karakoyun, 1967 * Kozano\u011flu, 1967 * Ana, 1967 * Kuyu, 1968 * Kara G\u00f6zl\u00fcm, 1970 ;TV shows * Orhan Abi Halk Show, presenter, TGRT, 1996\u20131997 * Popstar Alaturka, judge, Star TV, 2006\u20132008 * Popstar 2013, judge, Star TV, 2013 ==References== ==External links== * *Turkish Progressive Music and Orhan Gencebay *Official website Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:People from Samsun Category:Turkish male singers Category:Turkish folk singers Category:Turkish singer-songwriters Category:Turkish pop-folk singers Category:Turkish-language singers Category:State Artists of Turkey Category:Turkish people of Crimean Tatar descent Category:Turkish male film actors ",
