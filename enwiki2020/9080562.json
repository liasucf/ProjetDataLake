    "text": "The 250 nm process refers to a level of MOSFET (CMOS) semiconductor process technology that was commercialized by semiconductor manufacturers around the 1996-1998 timeframe. A 250 nm CMOS process was demonstrated by a Japanese NEC research team led by Naoki Kasai in 1987. In 1988, an IBM research team led by Iranian engineer Bijan Davari fabricated a 250nm dual-gate MOSFET using a CMOS process. ==Products featuring 250 nm manufacturing process== *Hitachi introduced a 16MB SRAM memory chip manufactured with this process in 1993. *Hitachi and NEC introduced 256MB DRAM memory chips manufactured with this process in 1993, followed by Matsushita, Mitsubishi Electric and Oki in 1994. *NEC introduced a 1Gb DRAM memory chip manufactured with this process in 1995. *Hitachi introduced a 128MB NAND flash memory chip manufactured with this process in 1996. *The mobile Pentium MMX Tillamook, released in August 1997. *The AMD K6-2 Chomper and Chomper Extended. Chomper was released on May 28, 1998. *The AMD K6-III \"Sharptooth\" used 250 nm. *The Intel Pentium II Deschutes, released in 1998. *The Dreamcast console's Hitachi SH-4 CPU and PowerVR2 GPU, released in 1998. *The Intel Pentium III Katmai, released in 1999. *The DEC Alpha 21264A, which was made commercially available in 1999. *The initial version of the Emotion Engine processor used in the PlayStation 2 console. ==References== *00250 Category:Computer-related introductions in 1998 Category:Iranian inventions Category:Japanese inventions ",
