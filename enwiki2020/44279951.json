In a review of the collection Andy Hedgecock wrote that Nina Allan is developing into, \"one of the finest stylists of modern genre fiction.\" He went on to say that very few writers had her talent to uncover, \"the strange within the ordinary with such clarity and precision.\"Interzone 222 page 54 (June 2009) Paul Kincaid in reviewing The Silver Wind asks when a series of stories can turn into a novel. He wrote that this was when, \"the congeries of stories tell us more than any individual stories can.\" He suggests that this has been achieved and outlines the links between the stories before concluding that the sum of the parts is greater than the individual stories.Interzone 237 page 45 (Nov/Dec 2011) One of the links is the viewpoint character Martin who appears in different parallel realities. Sofia Samatar however in her review questioned whether or not there is a danger in Allan's experiment of the emotional force being, \"more likely to be lost than gained in the leaps between parallel realities.\"Review in Strange Horizons 28 October 2011. In Peter Tennant's 2014 review of The Race he wrote that this was \"one of the finest books\" he had read that year, but also wrote that he did not know what it was about and could \"only hazard guesses.\" Although a novel, it is, \"four self-contained sections that form a greater whole.\"Interzone 254 page 67 (Sep/Oct 2104) Sofia Samatar agrees that \"The Race guards its secrets.\" She writes that, this is \"a distancing novel about drawing in, a science fiction novel aware of its own artifice, a literary fiction impatient with mimesis.\"Review in Strange Horizons 6 August 2014. ==References== Category:British science fiction writers Category:Living people Category:1966 births Category:People from Whitechapel Category:British women novelists ",
