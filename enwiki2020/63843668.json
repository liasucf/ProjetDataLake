He was born in 1766 in central Podrinje, though it is not known exactly whether in Bir\u010d, near Zvornik or Osat? He acquired literacy with Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107 at the Trono\u0161a Monastery, where he later became a monk and was given the monastic name Melentija.In the middle of 1794 he went on an Orthodox pilgrimage, that is, a pilgrimage to the Holy Land where he received the honorific title hajji (had\u017ei) given to all Eastern Orthodox who visit Christ's grave. Upon his return from the tour of the tomb of Christ with the acquired grammar of the had\u017ei, in 1795, with the help of the Ecumenical Patriarch Gerasimus III, he was granted permission to meet with Sultan Selim III, from whom he sought permission for the reconstruction of the Ra\u010da monastery. Had\u017ei Melentije requested the Sublime Porte that he be granted the monastery property \"od \u0160arampovine do Granovine, od Granovine do Sokolin, od Sokoline od \u0160arampovine\" (\"from \u0160arampovina to Granovina, from Granovina to Sokolina, from Sokolina from \u0160arampovina\", which amounted to 1,600 hectares of land. Upon his return to the Trono\u0161a Monastery, he chose two monks, Josif and Isaija, and went with them to Ra\u010da. With the Sultan's permission, he evicted janissaries who built an inn (han) on the ruins of the church foundation and Melentije wasted no time to begin to reconstruct the Ra\u010da Monastery anew. He built the door of the monastery temple all by himself in 1796. ==The first Serbian uprising== He was the organizer of the First Serbian Uprising in Ra\u010dan region from 1804 to 1813, a participant in the Ora\u0161ac Assembly, and the first to advance into battle with \"one cross in his hand and the other around his neck\" in the Drina and Podrinje regions.In this area, together with Kara-Marko Vasi\u0107, he commanded the Serbian army.He participated in fighting with the Turks in Osat in 1804, fighting at U\u017eice in 1805, near Soko Grad on the Drina in October 1806, Sikiri\u0107 (Osat) on the Drina on 29 September 1807, and on 12 October 1807 on Drina and Osat. Together with Kara-Marko Vasi\u0107, Milan Obrenovi\u0107, Mateja Nenadovi\u0107 and Ilija Bir\u010danin, he led the Serbian army in the battle with the Turks at Lu\u010dindan in 1808 in Oklec, Vranjkovina in Osat, and Pribi\u0107evi\u0107 near Srebrenica.For the victory of the Serbian uprisings against the Turks in Osat and the Drina on 20 October 1807, the Russian envoy Konstantin Rodofinikin proposed Had\u017ei Melentije and Mateja Nenadovi\u0107 to the Imperial Russian court to receive the coveted golden cross.When he travelled to Imperial Russia with Milan Obrenovi\u0107, Bo\u017eidar Grujovi\u0107 and Mateja Nenadovi\u0107 in 1810 to seek aid for the Serbian uprising, Had\u017ei Melentije was decorated by emperor Alexander I of Russia himself with a gold cross and a gold chain. The ruling People's Assembly (Sabor) in liberated Serbia appointed Had\u017ei Melentije locum tenens Metropolitan of the Metropolitanate of Belgrade in 1810 instead of the quisling Metropolitan Leontije Lambrovi\u0107. He was appointed bishop of the Eparchy of \u0160abac in 1811 for his merit in the fight for independence but was never consecrated owing to the fighting which continued without interruption. After the Ottoman quelling of the uprising in 1813, the Turks set fire to the Ra\u010da monastery and slaughtered the monks Isajia and Ignjatija. On this occasion, Had\u017ei Melentije, together with Kara\u0111or\u0111e, crossed over to the Austrian territory and settled in Hopovo monastery in Fru\u0161ka Gora, and stayed in the monasteries of Fenek, Remeta and Beo\u010din. Had\u017ei Melentije returned from the Austrian Empire to Ra\u010da in 1816, and rebuilt the monastery for the second time in the period from 1818 to 1823. He died on 27 March 1824 and was buried in the Ra\u010da Monastery, in the foundations of the monastery church, beneath the monument erected on the occasion of the centennial of his death. ==A monument== The monument dedicated to Had\u017ei Melentije Stevanovi\u0107 is located in the porti of the Ra\u010da monastery built into the very wall of the monastery church. \u041f\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0438\u045b, \u0402\u043e\u0440\u0452\u0435. \u201e\u0421\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0445\u0430\u045f\u0438 \u041c\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0458\u0443, \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0443 \u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0440\u0430 \u0420\u0430\u0447\u0430 \u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0458\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438 \u0421\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0445\u0438\u0458\u0435\u201d. \u0411\u0430\u0458\u043d\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0448\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0411\u0430\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430, \u0431\u0440\u043e\u0458 29.It is made of wedding white marble.The idea for the erection of the monument was initiated in 1924 on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the death of Had\u017ei Melentije by the then abbot Zaharije Popovi\u0107 (Zdravko Popovi\u0107 Mileki\u0107)). The work is the creation of academic painter and sculptor Mihailo Milovanovi\u0107 of U\u017eice, who presented the character of Had\u017ei Melentije after the story of Abbot Zaharije, descriptions from books and the Serbian folk song \"The Beginning of the Revolt against the Dahijas\". During the construction of the monument with his family, Mihailo Milovanovi\u0107 stayed in the monastery residence.The monument was unveiled and consecrated in the summer of 1924, and at the ceremony was welcomed by a large number of Ra\u010dan district residents and Bishop Jefrem Bojovi\u0107 of \u017di\u010da. ==See more== * Ra\u010da monastery == References == Category:1766 births Category:1824 deaths ",
