    "text": "Santana do Para\u00edso is a Brazilian municipality situated in the state of Minas Gerais which was founded in 1992. It forms part of the Vale do A\u00e7o metropolitan area. Its estimated population in 2004 was of 20.760 inhabitants. Before its foundation, Santana do Paraiso's location was a rest spot for people who travelled the road between the cities of Ferros and Coronel Fabriciano. The region is host to the \"Cachoeiras de Taquara\u00e7u\" (Taquara\u00e7u Waterfalls), in which horses could drink water and travellers could rest near. As time went by, people began building houses on the location, and a city was eventually established, being named Santana do Para\u00edso in homage to Nossa Senhora de Santana, a local saint. ==Economy== The municipality is the less important and less populated of the four main cities of Vale do A\u00e7o. Even so, Santana do Para\u00edso has in its territory some of the region's most important services, as Usiminas Airport and the Queiroz Galv\u00e3o waste treatment area, that attends the four cities. ==Prefects== * Ant\u00f4nio Luiz - 1993 * Helv\u00e9cio Matias de Oliveira - 1993~1996 * Juarez Ant\u00f4nio da Costa - 1997~2000 * Raimundo An\u00edcio Botelho - 2001~2004 * Joaquim Correia de Melo - 2004 ==External links== * Category:Municipalities in Minas Gerais ",
