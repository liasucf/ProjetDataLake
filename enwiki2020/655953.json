    "text": "The Lithuania national football team () represents Lithuania in international football and is controlled by the Lithuanian Football Federation, the governing body for football in Lithuania. They played their first match in 1923. In 1940, Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union; the country regained its independence in 1990 and played their first match thereafter against Georgia on 27 May of that year. Although Lithuania has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup, nor the UEFA European Championship, they have successfully participated in the local sub-regional Baltic Cup tournament, which takes place every two years between Lithuania and their Baltic rivals, Latvia and Estonia. Lithuania has won the Baltic Cup championship 11 times, only Latvia has won it more. Despite this Lithuania holds the record for winning the most consecutive Baltic Cup championships, four titles in a row from 1996 to 2000. Since 2012 the national team has played their home matches at the LFF Stadium in Vilnius. ==History== On 24 June 1923, Lithuania played their first ever game, at the Lietuvos Fizinio Lavinimosi S\u0105junga Stadionas, resulting in a 5\u20130 loss against Estonia. In 1924, Lithuania entered the 1924 Olympics in France, losing 9\u20130 against Switzerland on 25 May 1924. Two days later, Lithuania suffered a 10\u20130 loss to Egypt, a record defeat to date. During the early years of the Lithuanian national team, Lithuania regularly played Baltic neighbours Estonia and Latvia, with Lithuania's first win coming in a 2\u20131 away win against Estonia on 24 August 1924 in Tallinn. In 1930, Lithuania won the third edition of the Baltic Cup in Kaunas. On 13 October 1940, Lithuania played their final game for just shy of 50 years, a 4\u20133 win against Latvia, following the first Soviet annexation of the country. Lithuania's first game following the declaration of independence in 1990 was a 2\u20132 draw against Georgia in Tbilisi on 27 May 1990. In the 1990s, Lithuania established a respectable presence in the World Cup and European Championship qualifiers: third place in their group in both Euro 1996 and the 1998 World Cup qualifiers. In the Euro 2004 qualifiers, they were once again contenders for qualification and managed an away draw with Germany and a home win over Scotland; however, a 1\u20130 defeat to Scotland in the final game ended their hopes. Although finishing fifth in their 2006 World Cup qualifying group, Lithuania were nevertheless competitive. Lithuania drew with world champions Italy 1\u20131 in Naples in a Euro 2008 qualifying game on 2 September 2006, in the first competitive game that Italy played since the World Cup final. On 6 September 2008, Lithuania defeated Romania 3\u20130 in a 2010 World Cup qualifier. The victory was regarded by many as \"a historic win.\"FIFA World Cup uefa.com It was followed by another successful 2\u20130 performance against Austria in Marijampol\u0117 on 10 September 2008. ==Competitive record== ===FIFA World Cup record=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !colspan=9|FIFA World Cup record !width=1% rowspan=26| !colspan=6|FIFA World Cup qualification record |- !Year !Round !Position ! ! !* ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! |- | 1930 |colspan=8|Did not enter |colspan=6|Declined participation |- | 1934 |colspan=8 rowspan=2|Did not qualify | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 |- | 1938 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 9 |- | 1950 |colspan=8 rowspan=11 |Occupied by the |colspan=6 rowspan=11 |Occupied by the |- | 1954 |- | 1958 |- | 1962 |- | 1966 |- | 1970 |- | 1974 |- | 1978 |- | 1982 |- | 1986 |- | 1990 |- | 1994 |colspan=8 rowspan=7 |Did not qualify | 12 | 2 | 3 | 7 | 8 | 21 |- | 1998 | 10 | 5 | 2 | 3 | 11 | 8 |- | 2002 | 8 | 0 | 2 | 6 | 3 | 20 |- | 2006 | 10 | 2 | 4 | 4 | 8 | 9 |- | 2010 | 10 | 4 | 0 | 6 | 10 | 11 |- | 2014 | 10 | 3 | 2 | 5 | 9 | 11 |- | 2018 | 10 | 1 | 3 | 6 | 7 | 20 |- | 2022 |colspan=8 rowspan=2|To be determined |colspan=6 rowspan=2|To be determined |- | 2026 |- !Total ! !0/10 ! ! ! ! ! ! !73 !17 !16 !40 !59 !111 |} ===UEFA European Championship record=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !colspan=9|UEFA European Championship record !style=\"width:1%;\" rowspan=20| !colspan=6|UEFA European Championship qualification record |- !Year !Round !Position ! ! ! * ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! |- | 1960 | colspan=8 rowspan=9|Occupied by the | colspan=6 rowspan=9|Occupied by the |- | 1964 |- | 1968 |- | 1972 |- | 1976 |- | 1980 |- | 1984 |- | 1988 |- | 1992 |- | 1996 |colspan=8 rowspan=7|Did not qualify |10 |5 |1 |4 |13 |12 |- | 2000 |10 |3 |2 |5 |8 |16 |- | 2004 |8 |3 |1 |4 |7 |11 |- | 2008 |12 |5 |1 |6 |11 |13 |- | 2012 |8 |1 |2 |5 |4 |13 |- | 2016 |10 |3 |1 |6 |7 |18 |- | 2020 |8 |0 |1 |7 |5 |25 |- | 2024 |colspan=8 |To be determined |colspan=6 |To be determined |- !Total ! !0/7 ! ! ! ! ! ! !66 !20 !9 !37 !55 !108 |} ==Recent results and upcoming fixtures== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 100%;\" !
