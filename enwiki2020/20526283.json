However, archeologists report the last active eruption indicated by radiocarbon dating occurring around mid-Holocene or about 2050 BCE. ==Geology== Rock type is predominantly biotite, hornblende, and andesite, with dacite flows and dacitic tuffs similar to nearby Mount Natib. Mount Mariveles is on the Western Bataan Lineament volcanic belt of Luzon, which includes Mount Pinatubo, site of the second largest eruption of the last 20th century. ==Listings== The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS), the Philippine government branch that deals with volcanology in the country, lists Mariveles as a potentially active volcano for the age of its last eruption and active thermal features. ==Climbing Mariveles== A view of one of Mt.
