Lee has also served as Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan and the Democratic Progressive Party, and was reelected to the Legislative Yuan in 2012.

He studied public health at National Taiwan University and earned a master's degree in health policy from Harvard University before receiving his PhD in health economics in 1988 from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Upon Lee's graduation, he was slated to teach at NTU, but was placed on a blacklist and barred from returning to Taiwan by the Kuomintang-led government, stemming from his pro- democracy activities in the Formosa Incident during Taiwan's martial law period. During Lee's time as a student in the United States, he was also an active member of the World United Formosans for Independence, which attracted more of the KMT's attention. ===Return to Taiwan=== After returning to Taiwan through illegal channels and avoiding intelligence agents for fourteen months, Lee was arrested in September 1991, and charged with violation of Article 100 of the Criminal Code. He was released in May 1992, after would-be colleagues at National Taiwan University intervened on his behalf. Revisions to Article 100 were also passed that month, and meant that evidence of possible threats had to be submitted to the Commission of Violence prior to indictment or arrest. ==Political career== Lee was elected to the Legislative Yuan in 1996. He then became the youngest convener of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus in the legislature. Following DPP\u2019s successful presidential election in 2000, Lee was appointed by President Chen Shui-bian to be the Deputy Representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO) in the U.S. and then Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan. He was then named the DPP candidate for Taipei City's 2002 mayoral election, losing to incumbent mayor Ma Ying-jeou in a landslide. {|class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" colspan=7 style=\"width: 20em\"| 2002 Taipei City Mayoral Election Result |- ! style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" colspan=2 style=\"width: 20em\"| Party ! style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" style=\"width: 2em\"| # ! style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" style=\"width: 13em\"| Candidate ! style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" style=\"width: 6em\"| Votes ! style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" colspan=2 style=\"width: 11em\"| Percentage |- |bgcolor=\"#1B9431\"| |align=left|Democratic Progressive Party |align=center| 1 |align=left| Lee Ying-yuan |align=right| 488,811 |align=right| 35.89% |align=right| ImageSize = width:100 height:25 PlotArea = left:0 bottom:0 top:0 right:0 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy DateFormat = x.y Period = from:0 till:100 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal AlignBars = early Colors = id:gray value:rgb(0.85,0.85,0.85) id:blue value:rgb(0.00,0.56,0.86) BarData = bar:Wikipedias PlotData= bar:Wikipedias from:0 till:100 color:gray width:0.2in bar:Wikipedias from:0 till:35.89 color:green width:0.2in |- |bgcolor=\"#000099\"| |align=left| 25px Kuomintang |align=center| 2 |align=left| Ma Ying-jeou |align=right| 873,102 |align=right| 64.11% |align=right| 25px ImageSize = width:100 height:25 PlotArea = left:0 bottom:0 top:0 right:0 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy DateFormat = x.y Period = from:0 till:100 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal AlignBars = early Colors = id:gray value:rgb(0.85,0.85,0.85) id:blue value:rgb(0.00,0.64,0.64) BarData = bar:Wikipedias PlotData= bar:Wikipedias from:0 till:100 color:gray width:0.2in bar:Wikipedias from:0 till:64.11 color:blue width:0.2in |- bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" |colspan=\"4\" align=right |Total |align=right|1,374,862 |align=right colspan=2|100.00% |- bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" | colspan=\"4\" align=\"right\" | Voter turnout | colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | 70.61% |} He was named the head of the Council of Labor Affairs in 2005, and stayed on in the Su Tseng-chang cabinet.
