The race took three hours and thirty-four minutes. Attendance to this event has varying estimates. Many racing statistic archives list it at 46,000 people; the Associated Press reported a figure of 72,000 the day after the race. There was no such thing as owners standings at that time, NASCAR just chose those drivers it considered the fastest ones using such criterion as 1972 performance and practice speeds. == Car flip world record == At this event, daredevil Dusty Russell flipped a stock car in the air and landed 157 feet after a five foot ramp, in what was then a world record. He suffered a broken nose. ==Race report== No time trials were conducted due to weather issues; the average speed of the race was . Multiple-car teams were beginning to the de facto rule of NASCAR as complications from the increased level of national brand sponsorship made the sport more expensive to be a part of. Famous teams like Wood Brothers Racing, Nord Krauskopf's K&K; Insurance Racing along with Penske Racing South would make their early impressions on the sport with their massive budgets and corporate sponsors paying for new tires and engines instead of an individual owner or driver. There were only five traditional single-car owners at this racing event. Souvenir programs were sold at this event for a then-inexpensive price of $2 USD ($ when adjusted for inflation). David Pearson defeated Bobby Isaac in his 1971 Mercury Cyclone by at least two laps; NASCAR officials were responsible for giving out four cautions that lasted a duration of 31 non-consecutive laps. This would be David Pearson's second win in 1973 when he won 11 races of the 18 he entered, and was considered to be the best winning percentage ever for those amount of entries. Tony Bettenhausen, Jr. was the last-place finisher due to an oil leak on lap 9 out of 328. This was a race when people really began to consider Darrell Waltrip a future star. After his car was eliminated from the race due to mechanical issues (he charged to the fifth place but then got involved in a crash with Richard Petty and Buddy Baker), he substituted for A.J. Foyt. Pete Hamilton and Mark Donohue would retire from NASCAR after this race while Charles Barrett and Bettenhausen, Jr. would make their grand introductions to the Cup Series during this race. The winner received $16,625 in race winnings ($ when adjusted for inflation) while the last place finisher received $900 in total race winnings ($ when adjusted for inflation). After combining all the race winnings from all 40 drivers, the total prize purse for this race was $103,485 ($ when adjusted for inflation). Notable crew chiefs who participated in this race were Tim Brewer, Jake Elder, Travis Carter, Harry Hyde, Dale Inman, Tom Vandiver, and Bud Moore. Only manual transmission vehicles were allowed to participate in this race; a policy that NASCAR has retained to the present day. ===Qualifying=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Grid ! ! Driver !
