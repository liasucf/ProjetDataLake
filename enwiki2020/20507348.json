His father ran the building company Messrs. Pattinson and Son alongside serving as chairman of Ruskington Urban District Council.Dod's Parliamentary Companion. 1923. p. 350 Pattinson was educated at Abingdon House School, and Carre's Grammar School in Sleaford with his brother Robert (d. 1954), an active politician who chaired Kesteven County Council between 1934 and his death. Their eldest brother, John (d. 1939), was involved in the family business, supervising contracts in Liverpool and the south of England, before moving back to Lincolnshire; he represented Heckington and Sleaford on the County Council, became a justice of the peace and served as vice-chairman of the Sleaford Bench. Pattinson married Betsy Sharpley Bainbridge on 14 April 1897. She was the second daughter of a draper, George Bainbridge JP, of Portland House on South Park, Lincoln, and his first wife Annie, daughter of Edward Penniston JP of Doncaster. Following his father-in-law's death in 1916, Pattinson carried on the business with several other men and later became a director. ==Career== The Pattinson family ran a successful builder's merchants in Sleaford, Lincolnshire,The Times, 26 February 1955 of which Samuel was a director. He was also a director of Bainbridge's Ltd in Lincoln, his wife's father's company. ==Politics== ===Local politics=== Pattinson was an Alderman of Kesteven County Council and later for Lincolnshire County Council, on which he served as Chairman of the Finance Committee. He was also Justice of the Peace for the County.\"Pattinson, Samuel\". Who was Who. Oxford University Press ===Parliamentary politics=== He first contested a Parliamentary seat at the 1918 general election when he stood as Liberal candidate in Horncastle.The Times, 26 November 1918 As a supporter of H H Asquith he was not given the government coupon which was granted to Coalition Unionist William Weigall. Pattinson tried again at Horncastle at the by-election of 1920 which was called when Weigall was appointed Governor of South Australia but he lost by 1,413 votes to the Coalition Conservative, Stafford Vere Hotchkin. Pattinson was eventually elected to the House of Commons at the 1922 general election, beating the Conservative candidate by 1,639.The Times, 27 November 1923 He held the seat at the 1923 general election with a majority of 1,819 The Times, 15 October 1924 but he could not retain it in 1924 losing to Conservative candidate Henry Cobden Haslam, a science researcher from Cambridge University, by 1,169 votes The Times House of Commons; Politico\u2019s Publishing 2003, p 92 ===Bonar Law=== Despite his Liberal affiliations, Pattison was obviously an admirer of Tory leader Bonar Law. In December 1922 he informed his constituents in Horncastle that Bonar Law was \u2018the finest leader the House of Commons had seen for a very long time. [He]..held the House of Commons in the hollow of his hand\". Pattinson said although he differed in political viewpoint from Bonar Law, he admired him greatly and believed he honestly wished to do his best for the country.R J Q Adams, Bonar Law; John Murray, 1999 p341 By this time of course Bonar Law was prime minister having replaced David Lloyd George when his Liberal-Conservative coalition fell after the Carlton Club meeting of 19 October 1922. As an Asquithian Liberal, it is unlikely Pattinson had much regard for Lloyd George and his view of Bonar Law might have been coloured by this. By December 1922, the general election was over, so Pattison had no need to flatter Bonar Law to his constituents to try and earn Conservative votes. ==References== Category:1870 births Category:1942 deaths Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1922\u20131923 Category:UK MPs 1923\u20131924 Category:Members of Lincolnshire County Council Category:People from Ruskington Category:People educated at Carre's Grammar School ",
