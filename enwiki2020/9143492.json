Many scholars have suggested that the name is derived from Caesar, but the route it took to Scandinavia is not clear. ==Origin== In his Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l, Snorri Sturluson lists Kj\u00e1rr as a descendant of Au\u00f0i, the founder of the \u00d6dling dynasty: {| | style=\"padding-right:0.5em\" | [...] \u00feri\u00f0i Au\u00f0i, er \u00d6\u00f0lingar eru fr\u00e1 komnir, [...] Af Niflunga \u00e6tt var Gj\u00faki, af \u00d6\u00f0linga \u00e6tt var Kj\u00e1rr, af Ylfinga \u00e6tt var Eir\u00edkr inn m\u00e1lspaki.Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l, at Norr\u00f8ne Tekster og Kvad, Norway. | style=\"padding- left:0.5em\" | [...] Audi, from whom the \u00d6dlungs are come; [...] Of the Niflung's house was Gj\u00faki; of the house of \u00d6dlings, Kj\u00e1rr; of the house of the Ylfings was Eir\u00edkr the Wise in Speech.Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l, in translation by Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur (1916). | |} In the genealogy section of Hversu Noregr bygg\u00f0ist, further information is provided about Au\u00f0i and Kjarr. It presents Au\u00f0i as the grandfather of Kjarr and as an early ruler of the Celtic/Romance southerners: {| | style=\"padding-right:0.5em\" | Au\u00f0i haf\u00f0i Valland ok var fa\u00f0ir Fr\u00f3\u00f0a, f\u00f6\u00f0ur Kj\u00e1rs, f\u00f6\u00f0ur \u00d6lr\u00fanar.\u00c6ttart\u00f6lur, a section of Flateyjarb\u00f3k at \u00abNorr\u00f8ne Tekster og Kvad\u00bb, Norway. | style=\"padding-left:0.5em\" | Au\u00f0i ruled Valland and was the father of Fr\u00f3\u00f0i, the father of Kj\u00e1r, the father of \u00d6lr\u00fan.Translation provided by Wikipedia editors. | |} Egil marries Kj\u00e1r's daughter \u00d6lr\u00fan, a Valkyrie who dresses in swan skin. She turns out to be hard to keep. Kj\u00e1rr and his daughter \u00d6lr\u00fan also appear in the V\u00f6lundarkvi\u00f0a, where she is a Valkyrie who marries the master archer Egil, the brother of Wayland the Smith: {| | style=\"padding-right:0.5em\" | \u00dear v\u00e1ru tv\u00e6r d\u00e6tr Hl\u00f6\u00f0v\u00e9s konungs, Hla\u00f0gu\u00f0r svanhv\u00edt ok Herv\u00f6r alvitr, in \u00feri\u00f0ja var \u00d6lr\u00fan Kj\u00e1rsd\u00f3ttir af Vallandi. \u00deeir h\u00f6f\u00f0u \u00fe\u00e6r heim til sk\u00e1la me\u00f0 s\u00e9r.

These did they bring home to their hall with them. Egil took Olrun, and Slagfith Swan-White, and V\u00f6lund All-Wise. There they dwelt seven winters; but then they flew away to find battles, and came back no more. Then Egil set forth on his snowshoes to follow Olrun, and Slagfith followed Swan White, but V\u00f6lund stayed in Ulfdalir. He was a most skillful man, as men know from old tales.Henry A. Bellows' translation of The Lay of V\u00f6lund. | |} There are two other references which both place Kjarr far back in time as a contemporary of the Huns during the Age of Migrations. One of these is a poem in the Poetic Edda named Atlakvi\u00f0a: {| | :Sjau eigum vit salh\u00fas :sver\u00f0a full, :hverju eru \u00feeira :hj\u00f6lt \u00f3r gulli; :minn veit ek mar beztan, :en m\u00e6ki hvassastan, :boga bekks\u00e6ma, :en brynjur \u00f3r gulli, :hjalm ok skj\u00f6ld hv\u00edtastan :kominn \u00f3r h\u00f6ll K\u00edars, :einn er minn betri :en s\u00e9 allra H\u00fana.Atlakvi\u00f0a, at \u00abNorr\u00f8ne Tekster og Kvad\u00bb, Norway. | :Seven halls we have :Fulfilled of swords, :And hilts of gold :Each sword there has; :My horse is the best, :My blade is the keenest; :Fair my bow o'er the bench is, :Gleams my byrny with gold; :Brightest helm, brightest shield, :From Kiar's dwelling ere brought -- :Better all things I have :Than all things of the Huns.The Lay of Atli Translated by William Morris and Eirikr Magnusson. | |} Of old, they say, Humli (to the left raising his hand) over Huns did rule, Gizur (in the foreground, challenging the Huns) the Gauts... The second reference is in the Hervarar saga which contains a reference to K\u00edarr in a poem in fornyr\u00f0islag which lists the great kings of old: {| | :\u00c1r kva\u00f0 Humla :H\u00fanum r\u00e1\u00f0a, :Gizur Gautum, :Gotum Angant\u00fd, :Valdarr D\u01ebnum :en V\u01eblum K\u00edarr, :Alrekr enn fr\u00e6kni :enskri \u00fej\u00f3\u00f0u.The Poem Hei\u00f0r 89 at the database \"Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages\". | :Of old, they say, Humli :over Huns did rule, :Gizur the Gauts, :the Goths Angantyr, :Valdar the Danes, :the Romans Kjar, :Alrek the Valiant :the English people. | |} The few appearances of Kj\u00e1rr stand out from the general lack of references to the Romans in the literary sources of the Germanic peoples before the arrival of Christianity.Anderson, Carl Edlund. (1999). Formation and Resolution of Ideological Contrast in the Early History of Scandinavia. Ph.D. thesis, University of Cambridge, Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse & Celtic (Faculty of English). p. 45. ==Etymology== Many scholars have suggested that the name is derived from Caesar, but the route it took to Scandinavia is not clear. It may have been transmitted through a West Germanic language, but since Scandinavia and the Goths had close connections, it may also have been borrowed from the Gothic language and ultimately from Greek. The evolution of the name would have been \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1 \u2192 kaisar \u2192 *k\u0113sar \u2192 K\u00edarr \u2192 Ki\u00e1rr. A third possibility is that it originates from contacts with Rome beside the probably early borrowing R\u00fam in words such as R\u00famverjar (\"Roman soldiers\"). A less common theory is that it stems from Old Irish K\u00edarr or from Cearbhall of Valland (Wales). ==See also== * Dukljan ==References== Category:Heroes in Norse myths and legends Category:Julius Caesar Category:Roman Empire ",
