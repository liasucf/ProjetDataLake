    "text": "Several measures of light are commonly known as intensity: *Radiant intensity, a radiometric quantity measured in watts per steradian (W/sr) *Luminous intensity, a photometric quantity measured in lumens per steradian (lm/sr), or candela (cd) *Irradiance, a radiometric quantity, measured in watts per meter squared (W/m2) **Intensity (physics), the name for irradiance used in other branches of physics (W/m2) *Radiance, commonly called \"intensity\" in astronomy and astrophysics (W\u00b7sr\u22121\u00b7m\u22122) ==See also== *Brightness, the subjective perception elicited by the luminance of a source *Luminance, the photometric equivalent of radiance (lm\u00b7sr\u22121\u00b7m\u22122) *Photometry (optics), measurement of light, in terms of its perceived brightness to the human eye *Radiometry, measurement of light, in absolute power units ",
