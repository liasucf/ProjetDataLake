    "text": "Eastern Michigan is a member of the Mid-American Conference The Eastern Michigan Eagles, formerly known as the Normalites, are the athletic teams for Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti, Michigan, United States. The Eagles compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division I level as members of the Mid-American Conference (MAC). The only exception is the women's rowing program, which is a member of the Colonial Athletic Association. Altogether, the Eagles have won three NCAA Division II national championships and 13 NAIA Division I national championships in five different sports (baseball, men's cross country, men's swimming and diving, men's indoor track and field, and men's outdoor track and field); moreover, EMU has been NCAA Division I national runner-up twice. In 1940, the men's cross country team finished second to Indiana University at the national meet hosted by Michigan State University. The Eagles have also won the Reese Trophy, given to the best overall men's athletic program in the MAC, five times, most recently in 2018. EMU was a member of the Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference from 1950 to 1961, and has been a member of the MAC since 1972. ==History== The university was founded in 1849 as Michigan State Normal School. It wasn't until the school was Michigan State Normal College when the school's first nicknames (then Michigan State Normal College), were the \"Normalites\" and \"Men from Ypsi\". The \"Hurons\" first came into being as the result of a contest sponsored by the Men's Union in 1929. On Oct. 31 of that year, a three-person committee, composed of Dr. Clyde Ford, Dr. Elmer Lyman and Professor Bert Peet, selected the name \"Hurons\" from the many entries in the contest. The name was submitted by two students, Gretchen Borst and George Hanner. The runner-up name in that contest was Pioneers. The \"Hurons\" was adopted in 1929. EMU was a member of the Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference from 1950 to 1961, and eventually joined the Mid-American Conference in 1972. The university switched from NCAA Division II to NCAA Division I athletics in the mid-1970s. Since the 1991 season, Eastern Michigan University athletic teams have gone by the nickname \"Eagles.\" Since joining the Mid-American Conference in 1972, Eastern's most successful athletics programs in men's sports include: cross country with over 17 MAC titles, indoor track & field with 12 MAC titles, outdoor track & field with over 20 MAC titles and men's swimming & diving with over 30 MAC titles. The more successful sports in women's athletics include outdoor track & field with over 10 MAC titles and indoor track & field with 3 MAC titles. EMU football made three appearances in NCAA (football) bowl games in 1971 Pioneer Bowl, winning in the 1987 California Bowl and most recently the Bahamas Bowl in 2016. Eastern's men's basketball team has appeared in four NCAA Division I tournaments. They reached the Sweet Sixteen in the 1991 and in 1996 they beat Duke in first round. As well, men's basketball reached the Final Four of the 1972 NCAA College Division National Championship and were national runners up in 1976. On March 20, 2018, EMU announced the elimination of four sports: Wrestling, softball, men's swimming and diving, and women's tennis. Despite the dismal record over the years, football was not considered for elimination. NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision regulations mandate that each member school must field at least 16 varsity sports and the Mid-American Conference mandates football for its members.Eastern Michigan University budget woes prompt cutting of 4 sports programs Despite a court order to restart the softball team to satisfy a Title IX dispute, EMU stated a preference to add women's lacrosse, citing costs compared to softball as well as growing youth participation numbers for lacrosse. In November 2019, EMU officially announced the addition of women's lacrosse. The news coincided with the news of the MAC beginning sponsorship of the sport in 2021. EMU will join five other MAC members fielding women's lacrosse for the conference's second season in 2022. ===Huron to Eagles=== EMU began investigating the appropriateness of its Huron Indian logo after the Michigan Department of Civil Rights issued a report in October 1988 suggesting that all schools using such logos drop them. The report indicated that the use of Native American names, logos or mascots for athletic teams promoted racial stereotypes. At that time, four colleges, 62 high schools and 33 junior high/middle schools in Michigan used Native American logos or names, including Mid-American Conference rival Central Michigan University. CMU did not, however, change their nickname from the Chippewas. The EMU Board of Regents voted to replace the Huron name with Eagles, taken from three recommendations from a committee charged with supplying a new nickname. The other two final names submitted were Green Hornets and Express. The Eagles name was officially adopted on May 22, 1991, when the EMU Board of Regents voted to replace the existing Huron nickname and logo with the new one. During the 1991 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, announcer Jim Nantz talked about the controversy and referred to the team on-air as the \"No-Names.\" Some former students and faculty were angered that a unique name like Huron was replaced by something common like Eagles, especially for reasons of political correctness relating to Native American names, logos or mascots depicting a Native American. Early French explorers referred to these natives as the Huron, either from the French huron (\"ruffian\", \"rustic\"), or from hure (\"boar's head\"). According to tradition, French sailors thought that the bristly hairstyle of Wendat warriors resembled that of a boar.Trigger, Children of Aataentsic, 27. But these negative etymological meanings conflict with the \"bon Iroquois\" attitude held by the French fur traders and explorers. An alternate etymology is from the Algonquin words ronon (\"nation\"), or Irri- ronon (\"Erie\" or \"Cat Nation\"). It was pronounced Hirri-ronon by the French, eventually shortened to Hirr-on, and finally spelled in its present form, Huron. Other etymological possibilities come from the Algonquin words ka-ron and tu-ron (\"straight coast\" and \"crooked coast\"). Some alumni have refused to donate money to the school. The name change spurred an official chapter of the EMU Alumni Association, the Huron Restoration Chapter. The chapter claims to have the support of Chief Leaford Bearskin of the Wyandot Tribe of Oklahoma and former Grand Chief Max Gros-Louis of the Huron-Wendat Nation of Quebec to reestablish the team name as Huron. Since the change, the university has not altered the name and has continued to adopt the Eagle name. In 1994, the university adopted a new mascot called \"Swoop\". In 2011, EMU began its True EMU Campaign which aimed to unite all alumni stating \"Whether you are a Huron or an Eagle, whether you graduated 50 years ago or last semester, we want you to show the world you remember your times in Y-Town, water tower and all.\" Swoop, EMU's Mascot ===Mascot=== Swoop is the mascot for Eastern Michigan University. Before the 1991 season, Eastern Michigan University went by the \"Hurons.\" After 1991 Eastern has gone by the \"Eagles.\" Even though the school adopted the name \"Eagles\" it was not until 1994 when \"Swoop\" was adopted as the official mascot for the university. Swoop is depicted as an American bald eagle wearing an Eastern Michigan University jersey, displaying the numbers \"00\" on the front and \"Swoop\" on the back. Swoop's gender is undefined. At the Eastern Michigan University bookstore a stuffed animal pair can be purchased, one wearing a jersey, the other wearing a cheerleader outfit. ==Facilities== EMU Athletics oversees and uses several facilities on the EMU campus such as the EMU Convocation Center, Bowen Field House, Eagle Crest Resort (Ypsilanti, Michigan), the Indoor Practice Facility (the bubble), Olds-Robb Rec/IM, Oestrike Stadium and Rynearson Stadium. Rynearson Stadium opened in 1969 and is the largest facility on the campus. Convocation Center is a multi-purpose arena that opened on December 9, 1998 is the largest indoor facility. Bowen Field House is used by Eastern Michigan Eagles track and field, Eastern Michigan Eagles wrestling, and Eastern Michigan Eagles gymnastics. Oestrike Statium is used for baseball and softball events. The newest building operated by athletics is the Indoor Practice Facility, which opened in 2010. Six intercollegiate sports use the facility which include football, baseball, softball, women's soccer and men's and women's golf. ==Athletic bands== EMU Marching Band The Eastern Michigan University Marching Band, nicknamed \"The Pride of the Peninsula,\" was first formed in 1894. The Eastern Michigan University Basketball Band is directed by the two graduate assistants of the band. Unlike the marching band which is made up of all brass and woodwinds, the Basketball Band's instrumentation is strictly \"Brass and Sax.\" The Basketball Band travels with the basketball teams during the MAC tournament or the NCAA tournament. The school song \"Our Pledge\" was written by Edward Bowles and was arranged for the marching band by Thomas Tyra. The melody of \"Eagles Fight Song\" was written by Larry Livingston and arranged for marching band by Thomas Tyra. The percussion parts were written by Whitney Prince. \"Go Green\" was written by Thomas Tyra. ==Varsity sports== Eastern Michigan University offers 19 NCAA Division I varsity sports, 7 for men and 12 for women. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\" |- |- |Baseball ||Basketball |- |Basketball || Cross country |- |Cross country || Golf |- |Football || Gymnastics |- | Golf || Lacrosse (2021) |- | Track & field\u2020 || Rowing |- | || Soccer |- | || Swimming & diving |- | || Tennis |- | || Track & field\u2020 |- | ||Volleyball |- | colspan=\"2\" style=\"\" | |} ===Baseball=== Oestrike Stadium looking towards Huron River Drive.

One of the great highlights in team history came after the victory over Duke in 1996 when the Blue Devils' Head Coach Mike Krzyzewski stated, \"Eastern Michigan is very well coached, much deeper than we are and, today, much quicker than we were.\"Jon Wilner \u2013 SOUTHEAST\\Eastern Michigan knocks off Duke Los Angeles Daily News EMU reached the Final Four of the 1972 NCAA College Division National Championship, led by All-American George Gervin, an NBA Hall of Famer selected as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History.

After winning the first Ford Field game over CMU in triple overtime 61\u201358, they lost three in a row. The greatest football victory in EMU history occurred in December 1987. The MAC Champion Hurons defeated 17\u00bd point favorite San Jose State in the California Bowl. The victory culminated a 10\u20132 season and improbable rise from the depths of Division I-A college football. Only two years previous the team was in serious jeopardy of losing Division I-A status. Head Coach Jim Harkema was instrumental in resurrecting the program. The two losses in 1987 were both on the road, and were by a total of 11 points. The 1988 and 1989 teams each finished in second place in the conference and ended the most successful stretch of football in school history with its fourth straight winning season. After a long series of losing records, and finishing the 2015 season with a 1\u201311 record, they have since appeared in bowl games in 2016 and 2018 under head coach Chris Creighton. ===Women's gymnastics=== Eastern Michigan Eagles gymnastics is a collegiate women's gymnastics program.
