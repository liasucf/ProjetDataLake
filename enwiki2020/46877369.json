Chartier was selected by the San Jose Sharks in the 5th round (149th overall) of the 2014 NHL Entry Draft. ==Playing career== On December 31, 2014, Chartier was signed by the San Jose Sharks to a three-year entry- level contract. During the 2014\u201315 WHL season while playing with the Kelowna Rockets, Chartier scored 48 goals and 34 assists, and was named to the WHL Western Conference First All-Star Team. He was further honoured when he was named the 2014\u201315 CHL Sportsman of the Year. He scored his first NHL goal on October 29, 2018. Chartier as a free agent from the Sharks sat out the entirety of the 2019\u201320 season, due to lingering post-concussion symptoms. On October 14, 2020, Chartier returned to the professional circuit by signing to a one-year AHL contract with the Toronto Marlies. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
