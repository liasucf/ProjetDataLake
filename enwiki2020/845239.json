    "text": "Genoa is an area in Houston, Texas, United States located about southeast of Downtown Houston; it was formerly a distinct unincorporated area in Harris County. ==History== J. H. Burnett established Genoa in 1892; he gave the community the name \"Genoa\" because he believed that the climate was similar to the climate of Genoa, Italy. The post office opened during that year. The founder built a railroad depot serving the Galveston, Houston and Henderson Railroad, five houses, one hotel, and one store. The community was located along a main street that is now known as Almeda Genoa Road (the road from Almeda to Genoa). The east end of the community was the Old Galveston Road (Texas State Highway 3) and the Galveston, Houston, Henderson Railroad. The western edge was Freestone Street and the railway just to the west. Where the main street continued east from Old Galveston Road became known as Genoa Redbluff (the road from Genoa to Redbluff). The Handbook of Texas stated that Genoa \"grew slowly.\" In 1914 the community had 200 people and several businesses, including a general store, a dairy, a nursery, a blacksmith shop, and a carpenter. By 1925 the community had 100 people; the population remained at this level until around 1941. During that year Genoa had 400 people and fifteen businesses. The population remained at that level until Houston annexed Genoa in the mid-1960s. ==Government and infrastructure== ===Local government=== Houston City Council District E serves Genoa.City of Houston, Council District Maps, District E .\" City of Houston.
