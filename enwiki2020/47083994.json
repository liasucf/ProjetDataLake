It is found in Panama.Helcystogramma at Markku Savela's Lepidoptera and Some Other Life Forms The wingspan is 14\u201315 mm. The forewings are blackish brown with a violet sheen and with three, large, conspicuous, reddish orange blotches occupying about half of the wing space. The first of these orange spots lies on the basal third of the costa and extends obliquely outward and downward over the cell beyond the fold, nearly, but not quite, to the dorsal edge, ending in a sharp point above the middle of the dorsum. The second ochreous spot lies on the apical third of the costa, is like the first, irregularly pentagonal, with a point toward but not reaching the dorsum and a sharp attenuated point toward the apex. The third smaller orange spot, on the costa, just before the apex is drop shaped and is continued as a submarginal yellow line along the termen and dorsum, ending between the two large orange spots. The hindwings are nearly black.Proceedings of the United States National Museum 47 (2043): 19 ==References== Category:Moths described in 1914 perceptella Category:Moths of Central America ",
