    "text": "is a three-part treatise on Buddhist philosophy and martial arts written in the 17th century by Takuan S\u014dh\u014d, a Japanese monk of the Rinzai sect. The title translates roughly to \"The Mysterious Records of Immovable Wisdom\". The book is a series of three discourses addressed to samurai but applicable to everyone who desires an introduction to Zen philosophy, the book makes little use of Buddhist terminology and instead focuses on describing situations followed by an interpretation. Its contents make an effort to apply Zen Buddhism to martial arts. ==Chapters== All three chapters/essays are addressed to the samurai class, and all three seek to unify the spirit of Zen with the spirit of the sword. Of the three essays in the treatise, two were letters: * Fud\u014dchishinmy\u014droku, \"The Mysterious Record of Immovable Wisdom\", written to Yagy\u016b Munenori, head of the Yagy\u016b Shinkage-ry\u016b school of swordsmanship and teacher to two generations of sh\u014dguns; and * Taiaki, \"Annals of the Sword Taia\", (\u592a\u963f\u8a18) written perhaps to Munenori or possibly to Ono Tadaaki, head of the Itt\u014d school of swordsmanship and an official instructor to the sh\u014dguns family and close retainers. Individually and broadly speaking, one could say that Fud\u014dchishinmy\u014droku deals with technique, how the self is related to the Self during confrontation, and how an individual may become a unified whole. Taiaki deals more with the psychological aspects of the relationship between the self and the other. Between these, Reiroshu, \"The Clear Sound of Jewels\", deals with the fundamental nature of humans: how a swordsman, daimy\u014d \u2013 or any person, for that matter \u2013 can know the difference between what is right and what is mere selfishness, and can understand the basic question of knowing when and how to die.Takuan Soho, translated by William Scott Wilson, The Unfettered Mind \u2013 Writings of the Zen Master to the Sword Master, p. 3.
