    "text": "A bilingual sign in Chinese () and Manchu () in the Forbidden City Manju hergen (\"Manchu alphabet\") in Manchu The Manchu alphabet () is the alphabet used to write the now nearly-extinct Manchu language. A similar script is used today by the Xibe people, who speak a language considered either as a dialect of Manchu or a closely related, mutually intelligible language. It is written vertically from top to bottom, with columns proceeding from left to right. == History == === Tongki fuka ak\u016b hergen === According to the ' (; ), in 1599 the Jurchen leader Nurhaci decided to convert the Mongolian alphabet to make it suitable for the Manchu people. He decried the fact that while illiterate Han Chinese and Mongolians could understand their respective languages when read aloud, that was not the case for the Manchus, whose documents were recorded by Mongolian scribes. Overriding the objections of two advisors named Erdeni and G'ag'ai, he is credited with adapting the Mongolian script to Manchu. The resulting script was known as () \u2014 the \"script without dots and circles\". === Tongki fuka sindaha hergen === In 1632, Dahai added diacritical marks to clear up a lot of the ambiguity present in the original Mongolian script; for instance, a leading k, g, and h are distinguished by the placement of no diacritical mark, a dot, and a circle, respectively. This revision created the standard script, known as () \u2014 the \"script with dots and circles\". As a result, the Manchu alphabet contains little ambiguity. Recently discovered manuscripts from the 1620s make clear, however, that the addition of dots and circles to Manchu script began before their supposed introduction by Dahai. Dahai also added the tulergi hergen (\"foreign/outer letters\"): ten graphemes to facilitate Manchu to be used to write Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan loanwords. Previously, these non-Manchu sounds did not have corresponding letters in Manchu.Gorelova, L: \"Manchu Grammar\", page 50. Brill, 2002. Sounds that were transliterated included the aspirated sounds k' (Chinese pinyin: k, ), k (g, ), x (h, ); ts' (c, ); ts (ci, ); sy (si, ); dz (z, ); c'y (chi, ); j'y (zhi, ); and \u017e (r, ).Gorelova, L: \"Manchu Grammar\", pages 71-72. Brill, 2002. === 19th century \u2013 present === By the middle of the nineteenth century, there were three styles of writing Manchu in use: standard script (ginggulere hergen), semi-cursive script (gidara hergen), and cursive script (lasihire hergen). Semicursive script had less spacing between the letters, and cursive script had rounded tails.Gorelova, L: \"Manchu Grammar\", page 72. Brill, 2002. The Manchu alphabet was also used to write Chinese. A modern example is in Manchu: a Textbook for Reading Documents, which has a comparative table of romanizations of Chinese syllables written in Manchu letters, H\u00e0ny\u01d4 P\u012bny\u012bn and Wade\u2013Giles. Using the Manchu script to transliterate Chinese words is a source of loanwords for the Xibe language. Several Chinese-Manchu dictionaries contain Chinese characters transliterated with Manchu script. The Manchu versions of the Thousand Character Classic and Dream of the Red Chamber are actually the Manchu transcription of all the Chinese characters. In the Imperial Liao-Jin-Yuan Three Histories National Language Explanation ( ) commissioned by the Qianlong Emperor, the Manchu alphabet is used to write Evenki (Solon) words. In the Pentaglot Dictionary, also commissioned by the Qianlong Emperor, the Manchu alphabet is used to transcribe Tibetan and Chagatai (related to Uyghur) words.Manju (\"Manchu\") in Manchu script == Alphabet == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=\"4\" | Characters ! rowspan=\"2\" | ! rowspan=\"2\" | Transliteration ! rowspan=\"2\" | Unicode ! rowspan=\"2\" | Notes |- ! isolated ! initial ! medial ! final |- ! colspan=\"8\" | VowelsGorelova, L: \"Manchu Grammar\", page 59.

Manchu children were taught to memorize the shapes of all the syllables in the language separately as they learned to writeSaarela 2014, p. 169. and say right away \"la, lo\", etc., instead of saying \"l, a \u2014 la\"; \"l, o \u2014 lo\"; etc. As a result, the syllables contained in their syllabary do not contain all possible combinations that can be formed with their letters. They made, for instance, no such use of the consonants l, m, n and r as English; hence if the Manchu letters s, m, a, r and t were joined in that order, a Manchu would not pronounce them as \"smart\".Meadows 1849, p. 3. Today, it is still divided among experts on whether the Manchu script is alphabetic or syllabic. In China, it is considered syllabic, and Manchu is still taught in this manner, while in the West it is treated like an alphabet. The alphabetic approach is used mainly by foreigners who want to learn the language, as studying the Manchu script as a syllabary takes longer. === Twelve uju === The syllables in Manchu are divided into twelve categories called uju (literally \"head\") based on their syllabic codas (final phonemes). http://www.dartmouth.edu/~qing/WEB/DAHAI.html Here lists the names of the twelve uju in their traditional order: > a, ai, ar, an, ang, ak, as, at, ab, ao, al, am. Each uju contains syllables ending in the coda of its name. Hence, Manchu only allows nine final consonants for its closed syllables, otherwise a syllable is open with a monophthong (a uju) or a diphthong (ai uju and ao uju).The syllables in an uju are further sorted and grouped into three or two according to their similarities in pronunciation and shape. For example, a uju arranges its 131 licit syllables in the following order: > a, e, i; o, u, \u016b; na, ne, ni; no, nu, n\u016b; ka, ga, ha; ko, go, ho; k\u016b, g\u016b, > h\u016b; ba, be, bi; bo, bu, b\u016b; pa, pe, pi; po, pu, p\u016b; sa, se, si; so, su, s\u016b; > \u0161a, \u0161e, \u0161i; \u0161o, \u0161u, \u0161\u016b; ta, da; te, de; ti, di; to, do; tu, du; la, le, li; > lo, lu, l\u016b; ma, me, mi; mo, mu, m\u016b; ca, ce, ci; co, cu, c\u016b; ja, je, ji; jo, > ju, j\u016b; ya, ye; yo, yu, y\u016b; ke, ge, he; ki, gi, hi; ku, gu, hu; k'a, g'a, > h'a; k'o, g'o, h'o; ra, re, ri; ro, ru, r\u016b; fa, fe, fi; fo, fu, f\u016b; wa, we; > ts'a, ts'e, ts; ts'o, ts'u; dza, dze, dzi, dzo, dzu; \u017ea, \u017ee, \u017ei; \u017eo, \u017eu; sy, > c'y, jy. In general, while syllables in the same row resemble each other phonetically and visually, syllables in the same group (as the semicolons separate) bear greater similarities. == Punctuation == Tianming Khan) The Manchu alphabet has two kinds of punctuation: two dots (), analogous to a period; and one dot (), analogous to a comma. However, with the exception of lists of nouns being reliably punctuated by single dots, punctuation in Manchu is inconsistent, and therefore not of much use as an aid to readability.Li, G: \"Manchu: A Textbook for Reading Documents\", page 21. University of Hawai'i Press, 2000. The equivalent of the question mark in Manchu script consists of some special particles, written at the end of the question.Gorelova, L: \"Manchu Grammar\", page 74. Brill, 2002. == Jurchen script == The Jurchens of a millennium ago became the ancestors of the Manchus when Nurhaci united the Jianzhou Jurchens (1593\u20131618) and his son subsequently renamed the consolidated tribes as the \"Manchu\". Throughout this period, the Jurchen language evolved into what we know as the Manchu language. Its script has no relation to the Manchu alphabet, however. The Jurchen script was instead derived from the Khitan script, itself derived from Chinese characters. == Unicode == The Manchu alphabet is included in the Unicode block for Mongolian. == See also == * Mongolian script * Transliterations of Manchu == References == == External links == * Abkai \u2014 Unicode Manchu/Sibe/Daur Fonts and Keyboards * Manchu alphabet * Manchu script generator (Romanization \u2192 Manchu script (also for download)) * ManchuFont \u2014 an OpenType font for Manchu writing * Jurchen Script Category:Alphabets Alphabet Category:1599 introductions Category:Letters with final form ",
