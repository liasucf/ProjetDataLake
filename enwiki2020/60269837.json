This glacier was named after Sleipner, Odin's mythical eight-legged flying horse. ==Geography== The Sleipner Glacier originates in central Odinland, a heavily glaciated peninsula. It flows westward just south of Ensom Majestaet ('Lonely Majesty'), Odinland's highest point. The glacier is roughly east-west oriented and joins the left side of the Fimbul Glacier just north of its terminus in the Bernstorff Fjord (Kangertittivaq).GoogleEarth Together the Sleipner and Fimbul glaciers produce massive amounts of ice that blocks the fjord.Prostar Sailing Directions 2005 Greenland and Iceland Enroute, p. 102 {| |- valign=\"top\" |Map of part of Greenland section. |} ==Bibliography== *Climate-related glacier fluctuations in southeast Greenland ==See also== *List of glaciers in Greenland ==References== ==External links== *Satellite map of Sleipner Category:Glaciers of Greenland ",
