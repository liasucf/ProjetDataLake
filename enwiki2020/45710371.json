Ghika of Foreign Affairs and Grigore Filipescu, president of the Romanian Telephone Company Victor V\u00e2lcovici ( - 21 June 1970) was a Romanian mechanician and mathematician. Born into a modest family in Gala\u021bi, he graduated first in his class in 1904 from Nicolae B\u0103lcescu High School in Br\u0103ila. Entering the University of Bucharest on a scholarship, he attended its faculty of sciences and graduated in 1907 with a degree in mathematics. He then taught high school for two years before leaving for G\u00f6ttingen University on another scholarship to pursue a doctorate in mathematics. He defended his thesis in 1913; the topic was discontinuous flow of liquids in two free dimensions,Otl\u0103can, pp. 125\u20136 and amplified upon the work of Bernhard Riemann. He was subsequently named assistant professor of mechanics at Ia\u0219i University, rising to full professor in 1918.Otl\u0103can, p. 127 In 1921, he became rector of the Polytechnic School of Timi\u0219oara. There, he was also professor of rational mechanics and founded a laboratory dedicated to the field. During his nine years as rector, he worked to place the recently founded university on a solid foundation. From 1930 until retiring in 1962, he taught experimental mechanics at Bucharest University. In the government of Nicolae Iorga, he served as Minister of Public Works from 1931 to 1932. During this time, he introduced a modern road network that featured paved highways.Hager, p. 1361 Elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy in 1936,Otl\u0103can, p. 126, 127 he was stripped of his membership by the new communist regime in 1948, P\u0103un Otiman, \"1948\u2013Anul imensei jertfe a Academiei Rom\u00e2ne\", in Academica, Nr. 4 (31), December 2013, p. 123 but made a titular member in 1965.
