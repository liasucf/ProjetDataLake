    "text": "Ciro G\u00f3mez Leyva (born October 10, 1957 in Mexico City) is a Mexican news anchor and personality. He hosts the main newscast on Imagen Televisi\u00f3n and a morning radio program, Ciro por la Ma\u00f1ana (Ciro in the Morning), for Radio F\u00f3rmula. G\u00f3mez Leyva has also written for newspapers and managed radio and television stations, including the Sistema de Radio y Televisi\u00f3n Mexiquense and Milenio Televisi\u00f3n. ==Life== G\u00f3mez studied communications at the Universidad Iberoamericana and earned a master's degree in sociology from the National Autonomous University of Mexico. In the 1980s, he helped to start the Sistema de Radio y Televisi\u00f3n Mexiquense, with its radio and TV stations serving the State of Mexico; he also held brief stints as an editor at Expansi\u00f3n and as a special reporter for the El Financiero and Reforma newspapers. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, G\u00f3mez worked for CNI Canal 40, a news-oriented television station in Mexico City. He hosted the station's flagship newscast alongside Denise Maerker, who would go on to anchor Televisa's flagship newscast in 2016 and become direct competition for G\u00f3mez Leyva. During this time, in 1999, G\u00f3mez Leyva began writing a weekly column for the Milenio newspaper, titled \"La historia en breve\" (The Story in Brief), which four years later became a daily column. CNI ceased operations in May 2005 as a result of a workers' strike. In 2006, after CNI folded, G\u00f3mez was a panelist on Tercer Grado, a Televisa news and political talk show, and in 2008, he joined Milenio Televisi\u00f3n, helping to launch the network and anchoring its 10pm news hour. He remained with Milenio TV exactly five years and then proceeded to leave Tercer Grado in 2014. In January 2015, after 16 years, G\u00f3mez Leyva moved his columns from Milenio to El Universal, where he continued to write until July 2016. In 2016, G\u00f3mez Leyva was one of the first hires of the new Imagen Televisi\u00f3n national network, chosen to anchor the network's flagship late newscast. ==References== Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Universidad Iberoamericana alumni Category:National Autonomous University of Mexico alumni Category:People from Mexico City ",
