He wrote al-Jami` as-Sahih (known as Jami` at-Tirmidhi), one of the six canonical hadith compilations in Sunni Islam. He also wrote Shama'il Muhammadiyah (popularly known as Shama'il at-Tirmidhi), a compilation of hadiths concerning the person and character of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. At-Tirmidhi was also well versed in Arabic grammar, favoring the school of Kufa over Basra due to the former's preservation of Arabic poetry as a primary source.\"Sibawayh, His Kitab, and the Schools of Basra and Kufa.\" Taken from Changing Traditions: Al-Mubarrad's Refutation of S\u012bbawayh and the Subsequent Reception of the Kit\u0101b, p. 12. Volume 23 of Studies in Semitic Languages and Linguistics. Ed. Monique Bernards. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1997. ==Biography== ===Name and lineage=== Al-Tirmidhi's given name (ism) was \"Muhammad\" while his kunya was \"Abu `Isa\" (\"father of `Isa\"). His genealogy is uncertain; his nasab (patronymic) has variously been given as: * Mu\u1e25ammad ibn \u201b\u012as\u00e1 ibn Sawrah () * Mu\u1e25ammad ibn \u201b\u012as\u00e1 ibn Sawrah ibn M\u016bs\u00e1 ibn a\u1e0d-\u1e0ca\u1e25\u1e25\u0101k () * Mu\u1e25ammad ibn \u201b\u012as\u00e1 ibn Sawrah ibn Shadd\u0101d () * Mu\u1e25ammad ibn \u201b\u012as\u00e1 ibn Sawrah ibn Shadd\u0101d ibn a\u1e0d-\u1e0ca\u1e25\u1e25\u0101k () * Mu\u1e25ammad ibn \u201b\u012as\u00e1 ibn Sawrah ibn Shadd\u0101d ibn \u201b\u012as\u00e1 () * Mu\u1e25ammad ibn \u201b\u012as\u00e1 ibn Yaz\u012bd ibn Sawrah ibn as-Sakan () * Mu\u1e25ammad ibn \u201b\u012as\u00e1 ibn Sahl () * Mu\u1e25ammad ibn \u201b\u012as\u00e1 ibn Sahl ibn Sawrah () He was also known by the laqab \"ad-Darir\" (\"the Blind\"). It has been said that he was born blind, but the majority of scholars agree that he became blind later in his life. At-Tirmidhi's family belonged to the Arab tribe of Banu Sulaym (hence the nisbat \"as-Sulami\"). His grandfather was originally from Marw (Persian: Merv), but moved to Tirmidh. ===Birth=== Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi was born during the reign of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun. His year of birth has been reported as 209 AH (824/825). Cited by Adh-Dhahabi only states that at- Tirmidhi was born near the year 210 AH (825/826), thus some sources give his year of birth as 210 AH. Some sources indicate that he was born in Mecca (Siddiqi says he was born in Mecca in 206 AH (821/822)) while others say he was born in Tirmidh (Persian: Termez), in what is now southern Uzbekistan. The stronger opinion is that he was born in Tirmidh. Specifically, he was born in one of its suburbs, the village of Bugh (hence the nisbats \"at-Tirmidhi\" and \"al-Bughi\"). ===Hadith studies=== At-Tirmidhi began the study of hadith at the age of 20. From the year 235 AH (849/850) he traveled widely in Khurasan, Iraq, and the Hijaz in order to collect hadith. His teachers and those he narrated from included: * al-Bukhari * Ab\u016b Raj\u0101\u2019 Qutaybah ibn Sa\u2018\u012bd al-Balkh\u012b al-Baghl\u0101ni * \u2018Al\u012b ibn \u1e24ujr ibn Iy\u0101s as-Sa\u2018d\u012b al-Marwaz\u012b * Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Bashsh\u0101r al-Ba\u1e63r\u012b * \u2018Abd All\u0101h ibn Mu\u2018\u0101wiyah al-Juma\u1e25\u012b al-Ba\u1e63r\u012b * Ab\u016b Mu\u1e63\u2018ab az-Zuhr\u012b al-Madan\u012b * Mu\u1e25ammad ibn \u2018Abd al-M\u0101lik ibn Ab\u012b ash-Shaw\u0101rib al-Umaw\u012b al-Ba\u1e63r\u012b * Ism\u0101\u2018\u012bl ibn M\u016bs\u00e1 al-Faz\u0101r\u012b al-K\u016bfi * Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Ab\u012b Ma\u2018shar as- Sind\u012b al-Madan\u012b * Ab\u016b Kurayb Mu\u1e25ammad ibn al-\u2018Al\u0101\u2019 al-K\u016bf\u012b * Han\u0101d ibn al-Sar\u012b al-K\u016bf\u012b * Ibr\u0101h\u012bm ibn \u2018Abd All\u0101h al-Haraw\u012b * Suwayd ibn Na\u1e63r ibn Suwayd al- Marwaz\u012b * Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Ba\u1e63r\u012b * Zayd ibn Akhzam al-Ba\u1e63r\u012b * al-\u2018Abb\u0101s al-\u2018Anbar\u012b al-Ba\u1e63r\u012b * Mu\u1e25ammad ibn al-Muthann\u00e1 al-Ba\u1e63r\u012b * Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Ma\u2018mar al-Ba\u1e63r\u012b * ad-Darimi * Muslim * Abu Dawud At the time, Khurasan, at-Tirmidhi's native land, was a major center of learning, being home to a large number of muhaddiths. Other major centers of learning visited by at-Tirmidhi were the Iraqi cities of Kufa and Basra. At-Tirmidhi reported hadith from 42 Kufan teachers. In his Jami`, he used more reports from Kufan teachers than from teachers of any other town. At-Tirmidhi was a pupil of al-Bukhari, who was based in Khurasan. Adh-Dhahabi wrote, \"His knowledge of hadith came from al- Bukhari.\" At-Tirmidhi mentioned al-Bukhari's name 114 times in his Jami`. He used al-Bukhari's Kitab at-Tarikh as a source when mentioning discrepancies in the text of a hadith or its transmitters, and praised al-Bukhari as being the most knowledgeable person in Iraq or Khurasan in the science of discrepancies of hadith. When mentioning the rulings of jurists, he followed al-Bukhari's practice of not mentioning the name of Abu Hanifah. Because he never received a reliable chain of narrators to mention Abu Hanifa's decrees, he would instead attribute them to \"some people of Kufa.\" Al-Bukhari held at-Tirmidhi in high regard as well. He is reported to have told at-Tirmidhi, \"I have profited more from you than you have from me,\" and in his Sahih he narrated two hadith from at-Tirmidhi. At-Tirmidhi also narrated some hadiths from Abu Dawud, and one from Muslim. Muslim also narrated one hadith from at-Tirmidhi in his own Sahih. A.J. Wensinck mentions Ahmad ibn Hanbal as among at- Tirmidhi's teachers. However, Hoosen states that according to the most reliable sources, at-Tirmidhi never went to Baghdad, nor did he attend any lectures of Ahmad ibn Hanbal. Furthermore, at-Tirmidhi never directly narrates from Ahmad ibn Hanbal in his Jami`. Several of at-Tirmidhi's teachers also taught al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, and an-Nasa'i. ===Writings=== * Al-Jami' al-Mukhtasar Min al-Sunan 'an Rasulillah, known as Jami' al- Tirmidhi * Al-`Ilal As-Sughra * Az-Zuhd * Al-`Ilal Al-Kubra * Ash-Shama\u2019il An- Nabawiyyah wa Al-Fada\u2019il Al-Mustafawiyyah * Al-Asmaa\u2019 wa Al-Kuna * Kitab At- Tarikh == School of thought == Imam Tirmidhi was very close to Imam Bukhari, Imam Tirmidhi was a Shaf'i or Hanbali. Conclusion was whether he was mujtahid or muqallid as he was close to Imam Bukhari some claim he followed his madhab. == Accusation of heresy by some Hanbalites == Al-Tirmidhi was accused of being a Jahmite heretic, and was harshly criticized by some fanatic Hanbali followers, including Abu Bakr al-Khallal (d. 311/923) in his Kitab al-Sunna (Book of the Prophetic Tradition), because he rejected a narration attributed to Mujahid concerning the explanation of the verse 79 from Surat al-Isra' in the Qur'an about the Praiseworthy Station of the Prophet Muhammad, known as \"al-Maqam al-Mahmud\". The verse is: The Hanbalites interpreted the Praiseworthy Station as the seating of the Prophet Muhammad by Allah/God on the Throne, despite the overall weakness of the narrations supporting it. ==Death== At-Tirmidhi was blind in the last two years of his life, according to adh-Dhahabi. His blindness is said to have been the consequence of excessive weeping, either due to fear of God or over the death of al-Bukhari. He died on Monday night, 13 Rajab 279 AH (Sunday night, 8 October 892) in Bugh. At-Tirmidhi is buried on the outskirts of Sherobod, 60 kilometers north of Termez in Uzbekistan. In Termez he is locally known as Abu Isa at-Termezi or \"Termez Ota\" (\"Father of Termez\"). == See also == * Al-Tabari ==Early Islam scholars== ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Biodata at MuslimScholars.info * Biography at Sunnah.com * Biography of Imam al-Tirmidhi at Sunnah.org * Biography of al-Tirmidhee at theclearpath.com Category:Sunni Muslim scholars Category:Persian Sunni Muslim scholars of Islam Category:Hadith compilers Category:Hadith scholars Category:Medieval Persian writers Category:Muslim scholars persecuted by Hanbalis Category:People from Surxondaryo Region Category:Banu Sulaym Category:9th-century writers Category:9th-century Islamic religious leaders Category:9th-century Muslim scholars of Islam Category:9th-century Arabs Category:824 births Category:892 deaths Category:Biographical evaluation scholars ",
