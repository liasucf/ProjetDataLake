The Essential History of Rugby Union. Nick Oswald and John Griffiths. Headline Book Publishing. 2003 ===Provincial career=== He was named as a reserve for Glasgow District for their match against North of Scotland District on 15 December 1888. He was picked for Glasgow District for their match against North of Scotland District on 13 December 1890. He played for Glasgow District in their inter-city match against Edinburgh District in 1892, the Glasgow Herald noting him as 'D. Fisher junior'. ===International career=== Fisher was capped once by Scotland, in 1893. His ability split opinion on those who thought he was a notable forward and those who didn't. One Scottish Referee newspaper commentator rated all of the Glasgow District forwards and out of the 9 forwards tipped for selection for the time Fisher was among the best and good with his feet. Another Scottish Referee commentator said of Fisher's selection to the international team that he 'was a good way outside of the ability which should be in a Scotland team.' ==Other sports== Fisher was also in the West of Scotland Harriers. ==References== Category:1871 births Category:1932 deaths Category:Scottish rugby union players Category:Scotland international rugby union players Category:West of Scotland FC players Category:Glasgow District players ",
