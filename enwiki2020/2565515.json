It was originally established by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on June 27, 1957 by to recommend to the President people in the U.S. Civil Service to receive the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service. Its mandate was expanded via by President John F. Kennedy on February 22, 1963, so that the board would recommend to the President people to be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Jimmy Carter abolished the Distinguished Civilian Service Awards Board in Executive Order 12014 and turned over the responsibility for recommending recipients to the Chairman of the United States Civil Service Commission. This executive order was subsequently modified again by Jimmy Carter in which named the Director of the Office of Personnel Management as the person responsible for making recommendations to the President. (original language) (as currently codified by subsequent amendments by other Executive Orders) The Director of the Office of Personnel Management, under the authority of Executive Order 12107, has established the Presidential Rank Award Distinguished Review Board. See also Title 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations Sec. 578.17 Additionally, the President can confer the award on persons not nominated by anyone; however, normally, each component of the Department of Defense will nominate recipients through the Secretary and the Public Service Awards Panel. == References == Category:Civil awards and decorations of the United States Category:United States Office of Personnel Management ",
