In 1930 he relocated to Milan, and worked for the book and magazine publisher Angelo Rizzoli. After Rizzoli began producing films in 1934, Zavattini received his first screenplay and story credits in 1936. At the same time he was writing the plot for the comic strip Saturn against the Earth with Federico Pedrocchi (script) and Giovanni Scolari (art) for I tre porcellini (1936\u20131937) and Topolino (1937\u20131946). In 1935, he met Vittorio De Sica, beginning a partnership that produced some twenty films, including such masterpieces of Italian neorealism as Sciusci\u00e0 (1946), Ladri di biciclette (1948), Miracolo a Milano (1951), and Umberto D. (1952). In 1952, Zavattini gave an interview to The Italian Film Magazine 2, republished in English as \"Some Ideas on the Cinema.\" The thirteen points Zavattini outlined are widely regarded as his manifesto to Italian neorealism. In his only experience in Hollywood, Zavattini wrote the screenplay for The Children of Sanchez (1978) based on Oscar Lewis\u2019s book of the same title, a classic study of a Mexican family. At the 11th Moscow International Film Festival in 1979, he was awarded the Honorable Prize for the contribution to cinema. In 1983 he was a member of the jury at the 13th Moscow International Film Festival. Zavattini died in Rome on 13 October 1989. He was an atheist.Ugo Pirro, Soltanto un nome nei titoli di testa, Einaudi, Turin, 1998, p. 30. ==Directors== Among the many celebrated directors of Italian and international cinema Zavattini worked with in his more than 80 films are: * Vittorio de Sica, * Michelangelo Antonioni, * Hall Bartlett, * Alessandro Blasetti, * Mauro Bolognini, * Mario Camerini, * Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment, * Federico Fellini, * Pietro Germi, * Alberto Lattuada, * Mario Monicelli, * Elio Petri, * Dino Risi, * Roberto Rossellini, * Mario Soldati * Paolo and Vittorio Taviani * Luchino Visconti.
