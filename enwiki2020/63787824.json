He died in July, 1875, and his funeral service was held at St Peter's Hammersmith. He is buried in Hammersmith Cemetery. ==Legacy== By 1859 Dr Betts had drawn up plans for an educational trust, the St Peter's Hammersmith Free Schools Trust. The Trust provided for a school with three classrooms, one each for boys, girls and infants, to accommodate 350 pupils, together with two staff cottages. Dr Betts specified the curriculum and set up an endowment to fund the school and provide for the children's needs. The school started as St Peter's Hammersmith Free Schools, was later known as the Paddenswick Road Schools. Today it is known as the John Betts Primary School. The current charitable foundation was incorporated in 2018. ==References== Category:1799 births Category:1875 deaths Category:English philanthropists ",
