In 2006, Lee recorded his second album, Supply and Demand, which was produced by a friend of manager Bill Eib, Philadelphia musician and producer Barrie Maguire. An NPR Music reviewer described it as having \"more complicated instrumentation and production\" than his prior work. The song \"Shout Out Loud\" was released as a single and peaked at No. 76 on the Billboard 200, and another song, called \"Sweet Pea\", was used in an AT&T; ad campaign. Lee's third studio album, Last Days at the Lodge was released in 2008 and re-emphasized \"his grounding in folk and soul\".

Lee appeared at Farm Aid 2013 and on the compilation album, The Music Is You: A Tribute to John Denver. He released his fifth studio album, Mountains Of Sorrow, Rivers Of Song in October 2013.Poulsen, Drew (June 5, 2013) amos- lee-sets-date-for-mountains-of-sorrow-rivers-of-song-album Billboard, accessed Aug 6, 2013 ==Reception== Lee's \"folksy, bluesy sound\" has been compared to that of John Prine and Norah Jones. His music is said to utilize the \"supple funk of his vocals and arid strum of his guitar\" while recalling \"the low- volume, early-'70s acoustic soul of stars like Bill Withers and Minnie Ripperton\". A New York Times music critic described Lee as having a \"honeyed singing voice \u2013 light amber, mildly sweet, a touch of grain\" which he features \"squarely, without much fuss or undue strain\" in his \"1970s folk rock and rustic soul\" musical song craft. According to a music writer at ABC News, Lee \"has that folksy, bluesy vibe, with a bit of country twang\" and a voice that is \"ever soulful\". Simultaneously Lee has been both lauded and dismissed as the \"male Norah Jones\" and his lyrics are said to convey \"the complexities of everyday emotions\" without falling into flowery imagery. Lee's songs have appeared on a number of TV shows including House and Parenthood. ==Personal life== Amos Lee describes himself as being of mixed heritage; he admits he is not fully aware of his background. He maintains a residence in West Philadelphia. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Details ! colspan=\"7\"| Peak chart positions |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:35px;\"| US ! style=\"width:35px;\"| US Rock ! style=\"width:35px;\"| AUT ! style=\"width:35px;\"| FRA ! style=\"width:35px;\"| GER ! style=\"width:35px;\"| NL ! style=\"width:35px;\"| SWI |- ! scope=\"row\"| Amos Lee | * Release date: March 1, 2005 * Label: Blue Note Records * Formats: Vinyl, CD, music download | 113 | \u2014 | 72 | 112 | 75 | 13 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Supply and Demand | * Release date: October 3, 2006 * Label: Blue Note Records * Formats: CD, music download | 76 | 25 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 23 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Last Days at the Lodge | * Release date: June 24, 2008 * Label: Blue Note Records * Formats: CD, music download | 29 | 11 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Mission Bell | * Release date: January 25, 2011 * Label: Blue Note Records * Formats: CD, music download | 1 | 1 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 98 | 39 | 61 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Mountains of Sorrow, Rivers of Song | * Release date: October 8, 2013 * Label: Blue Note Records * Formats: CD, music download, vinyl | 16 | 7 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Spirit | * Release date: August 16, 2016 * Label: John Varvatos Records/Republic Records * Formats: | 30 | 3 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| My New Moon | * Release date: August 31, 2018 * Label: Dualtone Music Group * Formats: | 49 | 4 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- | colspan=\"15\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart |} ===Live albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:19em;\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Details ! colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:35px;\"| US ! style=\"width:35px;\"| US Rock ! style=\"width:35px;\"| US Folk |- ! scope=\"row\"| Live at Red Rocks (Amos Lee with The Colorado Symphony) | * Release date: June 16, 2015 * Label: ATO Records * Formats: CD, music download, vinyl | 103 | 16 | 4 |- |} ===Extended plays=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:22em;\"| Details ! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart positions |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:35px;\"| US ! style=\"width:35px;\"| US Rock |- ! scope=\"row\"| Amos Lee (EP) | * Release date: 2004 * Label: Blue Note Records * Formats: CD, music download | \u2014 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Live from KCRW | * Release date: 2005 * Label: Blue Note Records * Formats: CD, music download | \u2014 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| As the Crow Flies | * Release date: February 14, 2012 * Label: Blue Note Records * Formats: CD, music download, 10\" vinyl | 67 | 16 |- | colspan=\"4\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !
