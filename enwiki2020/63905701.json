    "text": "Paul St\u00f6cklin (* 29 June 1922; \u2020 19 July 2017) was a Swiss footballer who played for FC Basel in the 1940s and early 1950s. He played mainly in the position as Striker, but also as midfielder. St\u00f6cklin joined Basel's first team for their 1945\u201346 season under team manager Max Barras as they played in the Nationalliga B. After playing in two test games and in one Swiss Cup match, St\u00f6cklin played his domestic league debut for the club in the away game on 14 April 1946. He scored his first league goal for his club in the same match as Basel won 2\u20130 against Luzern. In his very next game, two weeks later, on 28 April St\u00f6cklin scored four goals as Basel beat Fribourg 6\u20131 in the home match at the Landhof. Basel ended that season with 43 points in 1st position to win the Nationalliga B and win promotion. During the teams next season (1946\u201347) Basel advanced to the Swiss Cup-Final, which was played in the Stadion Neufeld in Bern on 7 April 1947. Basel won the final 3\u20130 against Lausanne-Sport. In the final St\u00f6cklin scored two goals and Ren\u00e9 Bader the other. Team manager Anton Schall led Basel to win the Cup, but he died shortly afterwards at the age of 40 years during a workout on the football field. Following this unhappy event, team captain Ernst Hufschmid later took over as player-manager. In the 1946\u201347 Nationalliga A season St\u00f6cklin was his teams best goal scorer with 11 goals. In the domestic league match on 21 March 1948 away against AC Bellinzona St\u00f6cklin scored a hat-trick as Basel won by five goals to one. St\u00f6cklin played for Basel for seven years. But he missed Basel's first championship title in 1953 due to health reasons, in fact he was forced to end his active football career during that year. Between the years 1945 and 1952 St\u00f6cklin played a total of 238 games for Basel scoring a total of 90 goals. 156 of these games were in the Swiss Serie A, 27 in the Swiss Cup and 55 were friendly games. He scored 61 goals in the domestic league, seven in the cup and the other 22 were scored during the test games. Subsequently, St\u00f6cklin moved onto training and coaching, primarily to the young players of SC Binningen, where he worked as a youth coach until into the 1980s. ==References== ==Sources== * Rotblau: Jahrbuch Saison 2017/2018.
