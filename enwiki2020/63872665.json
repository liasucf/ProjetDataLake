    "text": "The Currimundi Lake (Kathleen McArthur) Conservation Park is a protected area that is located approximately north of Caloundra, Queensland, Australia. The park's total area is 50 hectares (124 acres). It was first declared as a conservation park in 1994, and is named after Kathleen McArthur. A large percentage of the park is wallum heath, which in turn then supports a large and diverse number of fauna; 353 species, 14 of which are introduced, 25 species are rare or threatened. A vast array of wildflowers may be seen in the park at any time of the year, but are most abundant in late winter to early spring. A local volunteer group currently visits the park every month to engage in activities such as removing of weeds and revegetating. The park has two well-mapped walking tracks with information signs. Picnic facilities are provided in the Crummunda Park, facilities include picnic tables, barbecues and toilets. == References == Category:Wide Bay\u2013Burnett Category:National parks of Queensland ",
