The soul first travels to the huge rock, Liyang, which is followed by a journey to Binagbasan, where the Tree of Records grows. After making a mark on the tree, the soul journeys to Pinagsayawan, where the soul must dance and sweat for atonement. The next journey is to Panamparan, where the soul gets a haircut to be presentable at Kumbirahan, where a banquet awaits the soul. The god Andalapit then leads the soul to the foot of Mount Balatucan, where the gods of the dead assemble to judge the soul. Good souls are sent to Dunkituhan, the cloud capped stairway that leads into heaven at the summit of Balatucan. An evil soul is sent to a river of penance for atonement until forgiven. Souls at the river sweat blood, the source of the river\u2019s color and fishy scent. A forgiven soul afterwards also goes into Balatucan\u2019s summit.Myths of the Philippines; Gaverza, J.K., 2014, University of the Philippines Diliman ==See also== * List of active volcanoes in the Philippines * List of inactive volcanoes in the Philippines * List of potentially active volcanoes in the Philippines * List of protected areas of the Philippines * Pacific ring of fire ==References== Category:Stratovolcanoes of the Philippines Category:Subduction volcanoes Category:Volcanoes of Mindanao Category:Mountains of the Philippines Category:Landforms of Misamis Oriental Category:Potentially active volcanoes of the Philippines Category:Natural parks of the Philippines ",
