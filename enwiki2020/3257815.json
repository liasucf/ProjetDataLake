    "text": "Jonathan Blair Hensleigh (born February 13, 1959) is an American screenwriter and film director, working primarily in the action-adventure genre, best known for writing films such as Jumanji, Die Hard with a Vengeance, and Armageddon, as well as making his own directorial debut with the 2004 comic book action film The Punisher. ==Early life== Hensleigh graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1981 with a degree in history.Carey, Mary. \"True to their school\". UMass Magazine, Winter 1999. He attended the University of Virginia School of Law, received his J.D. from Tulane University Law School, and was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar in 1985. Before moving into writing, he worked as an attorney for several years. At the age of 31 Hensleigh began writing scripts and screen plays. He had previously written a novel and a three-act stage play but did not go to film school. ==Movie career== Hensleigh's start in the entertainment industry came writing episodes of the television series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles. He received his first film credit in 1993's A Far Off Place, for which he wrote an early version of the script.Marx, Andy. \"Just Far Away: An Adventure in Adventureland\". Los Angeles Times, July 19, 1992, p. 24. His next two projects were Die Hard with a Vengeance and Jumanji, both of which were released in 1995. The Die Hard sequel was based on a spec script Hensleigh had originally conceived as a Brandon Lee action film before the actor's death, with the working title Simon Says. The script was considered for the fourth installment of the Lethal Weapon series before being picked up for Die Hard. Hensleigh participated in writing for The Rock, which became the subject of a dispute with the Writers Guild of America. In this case, the spec script (by David Weisberg and Douglas Cook) was reworked by several writers, but other than the original team, Mark Rosner was the only one granted official credit by guild arbitration. The rule is that the credited writing team must contribute 50% of the final script (effectively limiting credits to the screenplay's initial authors, plus one re-write team). Despite their work on the script, neither Hensleigh nor Aaron Sorkin was credited in the film. The director Michael Bay wrote an open letter of protest, in which he criticized the arbitration procedure as a \"sham\" and a \"travesty\". He said Hensleigh had worked closely with him on the movie and should have received screen credit.Welkos, Robert W. \"'Cable,' 'Rock' in Disputes on Writing Credits\". Los Angeles Times, May 21, 1996, p. 1. Hensleigh worked with Bay again on the 1998 disaster film Armageddon, and officially received credit for the screenplay. He helped rewrite scripts for the Jerry Bruckheimer projects, Con Air (1997) and Gone in 60 Seconds (2000), receiving executive producer credit for those. (This credits someone whose work on the film would otherwise go unacknowledged). Hensleigh made his debut as a director with The Punisher in 2004, with the assistance of his wife, veteran Hollywood producer Gale Anne Hurd. He co-wrote the script with Michael France, based on the Marvel Comics character The Punisher. Working on a tight schedule and with a relatively small budget, Hensleigh made a violent but restrained action movie that would be questionable to the spirit of the character.Olsen, Mark. \"Just call him 'The Punisher'\", Los Angeles Times, April 11, 2004, p. E8. Other movie credits include *The Saint (1997 screenplay, co-written with Wesley Strick), *Next (2007 screenplay), and *Welcome to the Jungle, a found footage horror film he released in 2007 as writer/director. At one point, he was set to write and direct Hulk, working on pre-production of that film for a year before pulling out. Some unrealized projects Hensleigh has worked on include a Gemini Man film and sequels to Jumanji and The Punisher. As of October 3, 2008, Hensleigh was developing the series Red Mars, which is based on the novel of the same name for AMC.AMC Plans Mars Mission In 2011, Hensleigh wrote and directed Kill the Irishman, based on the book To Kill the Irishman: The War That Crippled the Mafia, about the Cleveland mobster Danny Greene who was active in the 1960 and 1970s.\"Ray Stevenson Is The Irishman\", EmpireOnline ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Year(s) !Film !Director !Writer ! style=\"width:65px;\" ! |Executive Producer !Notes |- |1992-93 |The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles | | | |Television series (5 episodes) |- |1993 |A Far Off Place | | | | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |1995 |Die Hard with a Vengeance | | | | |- |Jumanji | | | | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |1997 |Con Air | | | | |- |The Saint | | | | |- |1998 |Armageddon | | | | |- |2000 |Gone in 60 Seconds | | | | |- |2004 |The Punisher | | | |Directorial debut |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2007 |Next | | | | |- |Welcome to the Jungle | | | |Also cinematographer; Direct-to-video |- |2011 |Kill the Irishman | | | | |- |2021 |The Ice Road | | | | |- |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+Uncredited writing works !Year !Film |- |1996 |The Rock |- |1997 |Con Air |- |1999 |Virus |- |2000 |Gone in 60 Seconds |- |2019 |Gemini Man |} == References == ==External links== * *Newsarama interview with Jonathan Hensleigh *New York Times Filmography *Hensleigh's Massachusetts Bar record Category:1959 births Category:American people of Irish descent Category:American male screenwriters Category:American television writers Category:Film producers from Massachusetts Category:Living people Category:People from Middlesex County, Massachusetts Category:University of Massachusetts Amherst alumni Category:Tulane University Law School alumni Category:Massachusetts lawyers Category:American male television writers Category:University of Virginia School of Law alumni Category:Film directors from Massachusetts Category:Screenwriters from Massachusetts ",
