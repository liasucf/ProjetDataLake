The name pays homage to the original Tuscan which was introduced in 1967. ==History== TVR Tuscan Speed Six Interior The Tuscan Speed Six was introduced in 1999 and was available for media demonstration in 2000. The reason being then owner Peter Wheeler imposing a ban on press reviews of the car. Initially, the Tuscan Speed Six was fitted with the 4.0 litre version of the TVR Speed Six engine rated at at 7,000 rpm and of torque at 5,250 rpm. Later, a Red Rose pack option raised the power output to bringing with it track focus chassis upgrades as well as an AP Racing braking system. The high performance Tuscan S was the top-of-the-line model rated at and had aerodynamic improvements over the base models most notably a rear lip spoiler to improve downforce. The Tuscan Speed Six under went a facelift in 2005 and was now called the Tuscan 2. Exterior changes featured a redesigned front grille and headlamps along with more conventional taillamps. Mechanical changes involved revised spring rates, improved steering response and different suspension geometry to make the car easy to drive on public roads. The base models were detuned to and while still retaining the basic weight figure of . The interior was also refreshed and featured a more conventional and ergonomic layout. Production lasted until 2006 until the closure of TVR. ==Specifications== ===Engine=== Five different inline-six engine options were offered to customers. Four of these were variants of the naturally aspirated 4.0 L Speed Six fuel fed by multipoint fuel injection making different amounts of power and torque, depending on the trim level selected. The last was a 3.6 L Speed Six which produced the same amount of power as the lowest-level 4.0 L engine, although slightly less torque. * Bore x stroke: :* ; :* * Power and torque: :* 3.6L Mk1: , :* 4.0L Mk1: , :* 4.0L Mk1 Red Rose: , :* 4.0L Mk1 S (pre-2003): at 7,000 rpm at 5,250 rpm :* 4.0L Mk1 S (post-2003): , :* 4.0L Mk2 (post-2005): , :* 4.0L Mk2 S (post-2005): , :* 4.0L Mk2 Convertible (post-2005): , :* 4.0L Mk2 Convertible Red Rose (post-2005): , :* 4.2L Mk2 T440R (2003): at 7,600 rpm, at 6,000 rpm. ===Chassis=== Even though there have been numerous tweaks to the Tuscan's chassis and suspension, the overall size and appearance of the variants remain virtually identical apart from minor aerodynamic aids to the S model in the form of an undertray in the front and a small boot-lid spoiler on the rear. In October 2005 the \"Mk 2\" version of the Tuscan was introduced, though in reality this was just a minor facelift. The modifications were restricted to cosmetic changes to the front and rear lights, the dashboard, and the spoilers on the S model plus some minor changes to the chassis to improve the handling. At the same time, a new variant a full soft top was introduced alongside the original targa version. ===Performance=== * 0\u201330 mph (48 km/h): 1.72 s * 0\u201360 mph (97 km/h): 3.68 s * 0\u2013100 mph (161 km/h): 8.08 s * 100\u20130 mph: 4.15 s TVR Tuscan T400R, run by Team LNT in the Le Mans Series These test results were achieved in a post-2003 Tuscan S without traction-control or anti-lock brakes. TVR's design philosophy holds that such features do not improve either the performance or safety of their vehicles and thus they are not so equipped. TVR rejects the notion that these features, along with airbags, are \"safety devices\" and believes that, based on testing and experience, their cars are safer without these things than with them. A modified version of the car was used in the 2003 24 Hours of Le Mans, and again the following year. ==In popular culture== A TVR Tuscan was used as a spy car in the 2003 movie Looney Tunes: Back in Action. One was also featured in the feature film Swordfish (2001). ==References== ==External links== *Official TVR website Tuscan Category:Sports cars Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Coup\u00e9s Category:Cars introduced in 1999 Category:2000s cars Category:24 Hours of Le Mans race cars ",
