    "text": "The Krannert School of Management is the school of management at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, United States. The business school offers instruction at the undergraduate, master's, and doctoral levels. ==History== The School of Industrial Management at Purdue University was created in 1958 from the merger of the Department of Economics (established in the School of Science, Education, and Humanities in 1953) and the Department of Industrial Management and Transportation (part of the Schools of Engineering since 1956). The Krannert Graduate School of Industrial Administration was founded in 1962 with a $2.7 million endowment from Herman Krannert and Ellnora Krannert. The AACSB accredited the new school in 1967. In the early years, students were required to pursue a second major, in a technical subject, in addition to their coursework in business and management. The curriculum expanded over the following decade and the word \"Industrial\" was dropped from the schools' names in the mid 1970s. Today, the Krannert name refers to both the undergraduate and post-graduate programs. Krannert is accredited by the AACSB. ==Academics== The school currently has nearly 20 clubs and organizations open to undergraduates, including the School of Management Council (SMC). There are some 25 professional, cultural and special interest clubs at the graduate level, including the Krannert Graduate Student Association (KGSA) and the Krannert Doctoral Student Association (KDSA). ===Undergraduate=== The School of Management offers eight undergraduate degree programs; Accounting; Economics; Finance; Industrial Management; Management; Marketing; Strategy and Organizational Management; and Supply Chain Information and Analytics. In keeping with the global scope of the modern manager, all programs include instruction in the international aspects of business and economics. The \"3+2\" program is available to outstanding undergraduates in the School of Management. The program allows students to complete their B.S. and Master of Business Administration (MBA) degrees in just five years. Over the course of an academic year, Purdue is the site for campus interviewing activities and numerous career fairs. Some 1,200-1,400 unique companies visit campus and meet with students seeking internships, co- ops or full employment. One of the highest-profile and most attended, both by employers and student job-seekers, is Krannert\u2019s School of Management Employers Forum (SMEF), which includes student-run careers fairs each fall and spring semester. Krannert hosted 147 companies for its forum this fall, which equaled the participation in the 2008 fair and is an increase of about 15 percent over the previous two events. Fifty-five of those companies gave presentations either the day before or during the evening after the fair, and about 60 companies requested interview schedules. Job recruiters ranked Krannert School of Management third in a 2012 Bloomberg Businessweek national survey of undergraduate business schools. The survey asked recruiters, among other criteria, which programs turned out the best graduates, which schools have the most innovative curricula, and which have the most effective career services areas. Krannert ranked seventh in 2011 and 13th in 2010. For 2011, US News and World Report ranked Krannert #24 in the nation overall for its undergraduate programs, #4 in quantitative analysis/methods, #8 in supply chain management/logistics and #10 in management information systems. ===Master's & Executive=== Krannert awards several master's degrees: MBA, EMBA, International Masters in Management, Master of Science in Human Resource Management, Master of Science in Industrial Administration, Master of Science in Finance, Master of Science in Global Entrepreneurship, Master of Science in Global Supply Chain Management and a Weekend MBA.Krannert School of Management - Masters Home These programs are housed in Rawls Hall.

Krannert's doctoral programs were ranked #23 in the world for 2009 and #25 for 2013 by Financial Times. ==Facilities== The school's facilities are located on the southeastern part of Purdue's West Lafayette campus near the Purdue Memorial Union. The majority of undergraduate classes are conducted in the Krannert Building, which opened in 1964. Rawls Hall is the home of all the classes in the Masters program. Rawls Hall houses 13 electronically equipped classrooms, a professional career center, a multimedia-based auditorium, 25 breakout rooms, distance learning facilities, and sophisticated computer labs. The building is named for Krannert master's alum, Jerry S. Rawls. Rawls, the president and chief executive officer of Finisar Corp., donated $10 million to the Krannert at the Frontier Campaign. The gift is the largest in Krannert history and one of the largest at Purdue. In recognition of his generosity, the Purdue Board of Trustees voted in 2000 to name the new Krannert facility Jerry S. Rawls Hall. The Jerry Rawls Hall was dedicated on October 2, 2003. ==Alumni== * Sam Allen, retired chairman and chief executive officer for Deere & Company * Susan Bulkeley Butler, founder and CEO of the SBB Institute, and first female partner of Accenture * Drew Brees, NFL quarterback for the New Orleans Saints * Beth Brooke-Marciniak, global vice chair of public policy for Ernst & Young * Doug DeVos, president of Amway * Joe Forehand, former chairman and CEO of Accenture * Dave Fuente, chairman of SSA & Company * Greg Hayes, CEO and chair of United Technologies; Business Roundtable member * Robbie Hummel, professional basketball player * Howard Lance, executive advisor at The Blackstone Group, former chairman, president, and CEO of Harris Corporation * Marshall Larsen, retired chairman, president, and CEO at Goodrich * Preston McAfee, chief economist at Microsoft * Jerry S.
