    "text": "Eduard Albert Meier, commonly nicknamed \"Billy\", is the founder of a UFO religion called the \"Freie Interessengemeinschaft f\u00fcr Grenz- und Geisteswissenschaften und Ufologiestudien\" (Free Community of Interests for the Border and Spiritual Sciences and Ufological Studies) and alleged contactee whose UFO photographs are claimed to show alien spacecraft. Meier claims to be in regular contact with extraterrestrial beings he calls the Plejaren. He also presented other material during the 1970s such as metal samples, sound recordings and film footage. Meier claims to be the seventh reincarnation after six prophets common to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam: Enoch, Elijah, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Immanuel (Jesus), and Mohammed. Meier has been widely characterized as a fraud by skeptics and ufologists, who suggest that he used models to hoax photos claimed to show alien spacecraft. == Background == One of Meier's photographs of \"a beamship floating beside a tree\". Born in the town of B\u00fclach in the Z\u00fcrcher Unterland, Meier joined the French Foreign Legion in his teens, but says he soon left and returned home. In 1965, he lost his left arm in a bus accident in Turkey. Some time later, he met and married a Greek woman, Kalliope Zafiriou, with whom he had three children. The nickname \"Billy\" came by way of an American friend who thought Meier's cowboy style of dress reminded her of \"Billy the Kid.\" This anecdote was told by Meier in an interview with Bob Zanotti of Swiss Radio International in June, 1982. == Alleged extraterrestrial contacts == Meier claims his extraterrestrial encounters began in 1942, at the age of five, when he met an elderly Plejaren man named \"Sfath\". After Sfath's death in 1953, Meier said, he began communicating with an extraterrestrial woman (though not a Plejaren) called \"Asket\". All contacts ceased in 1964, he said, then resumed on January 28, 1975, when he met \"Semjase\", the granddaughter of Sfath, and shortly thereafter another Plejaren man called \"Ptaah\". Other extraterrestrials have since allegedly joined the dialog as well. Meier founded a non-profit, tax-paying organization based on his alleged contacts with Semjase, called the \"Freie Interessengemeinschaft f\u00fcr Grenz- und Geisteswissenschaften und Ufologiestudien\" (Free Community of Interests for the Border and Spiritual Sciences and Ufological Studies) in the late 1970s and established his \"Semjase Silver Star Center\". The organization's headquarters is in Switzerland.George D. Chryssides. Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements. Rowman & Littlefield; 2012. . p. 312\u2013. == Photographs, films == Meier's photographs and films are claimed by him to show alien spacecraft floating above the Swiss countryside. He calls the alleged spaceships \"beamships\" from Plejaren. According to Meier, the Plejaren gave him permission to photograph and film their beamships so that he could produce evidence of their extraterrestrial visitations. Some of Meier's photos are claimed by him to show prehistoric Earth scenes, extraterrestrials, and celestial objects from an alleged non-Earthly vantage point. Meier's claims are widely characterized as fraudulent by scientists, skeptics, and most ufologists, who say that his photographs and films are hoaxes.Aaron John Gulyas. Extraterrestrials and the American Zeitgeist: Alien Contact Tales Since the 1950s. McFarland; 6 May 2013. . p. 138\u2013. In 1997, Meier's ex-wife, Kalliope, told interviewers that his photos were of spaceship models he crafted with items like trash can lids, carpet tacks and other household objects, and that the stories he told of his adventures with the aliens were similarly fictitious. She also said that photos of purported extraterrestrial women \"Asket\" and \"Nera\" were really photos of Michelle DellaFave and Susan Lund, members of the singing and dancing troupe The Golddiggers.Outer Space Pictures \u2013 Asket-Nera-Semjase \u2013 Summary billymeieruforesearch.com, retrieved March 20, 2017. It was later confirmed that the women in the photographs were members of The Golddiggers performing on The Dean Martin Show. == See also == * List of alleged extraterrestrial beings == References == == External links == * \u2014 Billy Meier's official website *An independent third party review Category:1937 births Category:Ancient astronauts proponents Category:Living people Category:UFO writers Category:Ufologists Category:Self-declared messiahs Category:Soldiers of the French Foreign Legion Category:Swiss amputees ",
