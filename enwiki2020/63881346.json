By 1914, it had fallen into disrepair. In 1963, a restoration effort was started by the Lenihan family, which saw the roofs of the castle and guest house replaced and the battlements raised back to their original height. Unusually, the castle's owners have been recorded since as early as 1574, when it was owned by Richard Beag Burke. == Modern usage == The castle nowadays primarily functions as a restaurant and pub, tourist destination, and hotel. It is commonly used for events such as weddings and corporate functions. == References == Category:Castles in County Galway Category:National Monuments in County Galway Category:Tower houses in the Republic of Ireland ",
