    "text": "Gamma Lyrae (Latinized from \u03b3 Lyrae, abbreviated Gamma Lyr, \u03b3 Lyr), formally named Sulafat , is the second-brightest star in the northern constellation of Lyra. With an apparent visual magnitude of 3.3, it is readily visible to the naked eye. Parallax measurements yield an estimated distance of from the Sun. At that distance, the visual magnitude of the star is diminished by an extinction factor of due to interstellar dust. ==Nomenclature== \u03b3 Lyrae (Latinised to Gamma Lyrae) is the star's Bayer designation. It bore the traditional names Sulafat (Sulaphat), from the Arabic al-sul\u1e25af\u0101t \"turtle\", and Jugum, from the Latin \"yoke\". The connection with turtles is that fine harps were traditionally made of tortoiseshell. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name Sulafat for this star on 21 August 2016 and it is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. In Chinese astronomy, (), meaning Clepsydra Terrace, refers to an asterism consisting of this star, Delta2 Lyrae, Beta Lyrae and Iota Lyrae.

The effective temperature of the outer envelope of this star is 10,080 K, giving it the blue-white hue typical of a B-type star. The interferometry-measured angular diameter of this star is , which, at its estimated distance, equates to a physical radius of roughly 15 times the radius of the Sun. In 1909, Canadian astronomer Samuel A. Mitchell identified this star as a spectroscopic binary, although he was unable to split the absorption lines of the components. He found that a period of 25.6 days matched his measurements. It was reported as a spectroscopic binary as recently as 2001, but is now believed to be a single star with a high rate of rotation for stars of this type. ==References== {0.0046491\\ \\text{AU}/R_{\\bigodot}} \\\\\\ & \\approx 30\\cdot R_{\\bigodot} \\end{align} }} ==External links== * Category:Lyra (constellation) Lyrae, Gamma Sulafat Lyrae, 14 Category:B-type giants 093194 7178 176437 Category:Durchmusterung objects ",
