    "text": "Hitoshi Ishii (\u77f3\u4e95 \u4ec1 \u53f8 Ishii Hitoshi, born 12 October 1947) is a Japanese mathematician, specializing in partial differential equations. Ishii first studied physics and then mathematics at Waseda University in Tokyo with a master's degree in 1972 and a doctorate in 1975 with dissertation (Lp solvability and uniqueness of the initial value problem for partial differential equations).Entry 000008558358 in the Doctoral Dissertation Bibliographic Database of the National Institute of Informatics He was an assistant professor at the Ch\u016b\u014d University in Tokyo from 1976 and from 1989 a full professor. In 1996, he became a professor at Tokyo Metropolitan University and from 2001, he was a professor at Waseda University. He deals with nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) such as the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation, viscosity solutions of PDEs, optimal control theory, differential games, and evolution of surfaces. In 1987/88 he was a visiting professor at Brown University, in 2011 at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, and in 2010 at the University of Chicago. From 2011 to 2014 he was an adjunct professor at King Abdulaziz University. In 1994 Ishii received the Autumn Prize from the Mathematical Society of Japan. In 2002 he was named to the Thomson ISI list of highly cited researchers in mathematics. He was an invited speaker with talk Asymptotic solutions for large time of Hamilton-Jacobi equations at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 2006 in Madrid. He was an invited speaker at the 7th International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM) 2007 in Zurich. In 2012 he was elected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society. ==Selected publications== * with Michael G.
