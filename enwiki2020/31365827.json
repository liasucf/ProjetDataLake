    "text": "Bad Girls returned to ITV1 with its third series on 20 March 2001 and ended on 3 July 2001. It consists of 16 episodes. The third series picks up directly from the series two finale. Shell has led Fenner into her trap by luring him into her cell and stabbing him with a broken bottle she smuggled back from Bodybag's anniversary party. Fenner almost loses his life, while Hollamby has Shell transferred to the mental health wing where she comes face-to-face with an old enemy. Helen manages to get Nikki back into Larkhall where Helen puts an end to their relationship. Shell and Denny escape and wreak havoc in London, as they pay Hollamby a surprise visit at her home. Things seem to be going well for Crystal, who has recently been released from prison and is now engaged to Josh, but things are set to get worse as Shell and Denny arrive at her house. Maxi & Tina Purvis and Al MacKenzie (aka The Peckham Bootgang) arrive on G-Wing and make their presence known to the prisoners and officers alike. Josh has just become a prison officer, but he's in for a shock when he sees that Crystal is back on the wing. Nikki is set for her appeal, and if she wins will she find Helen waiting for her? ==Main cast== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"background-color: #3969B5; color:white\"| Cast !! style=\"background-color: #3969B5; color:white\"| Character |- | Simone Lahbib || Helen Stewart |- | Mandana Jones || Nikki Wade |- | Debra Stephenson || Shell Dockley |- | Claire King || Karen Betts |- | Jack Ellis || Jim Fenner |- | Alicya Eyo || Denny Blood |- | Sharon Duncan-Brewster || Crystal Gordon |- | Linda Henry || Yvonne Atkins |- | Helen Fraser || Sylvia Hollamby |- | Nathan Constance || Josh Mitchell |- | Victoria Alcock || Julie Saunders |- | Kika Mirylees || Julie Johnston |- | Lindsey Fawcett || Shaz Wylie |- | Kim Oliver || Buki Lester |- | Kerry Norton || Maxi Purvis |- | Victoria Bush || Tina Purvis |- | Pauline Campbell || Al McKenzie |- | Tracey Wilkinson || Di Barker |- | Lisa Turner || Gina Rossi |- | Paul Opacic || Mark Waddle |} ==Guest cast== Special guest: * Kate O'Mara as Virginia O'Kane Recurring cast: * Michael Higgs as Dr. Thomas Waugh * Kate Steavenson-Payne as Charlotte Myddleton * Philip McGough as Dr. Malcolm Nicholson * Roland Oliver as Simon Stubberfield * Kim Taylforth as Marilyn Fenner * Eugene Walker as Officer Blakeson * Danielle King as Lauren Atkins * Ivan Kaye as Charlie Atkins * Geoffrey Hutchings as Bobby Hollamby * Wendi Peters as Pam Jolly * Helen Schlesinger as Tessa Spall * Jane Lowe as Monica Lindsay * Steven Webb as David Saunders * Anthonia Lanre-Ajose as Femi Bada * Helen Grace as Caroline Lewis * Victoria Pritchard as Trisha Guest cast: * Petia Pavlova - Prison Inmate * Sally Watts - Betty Wheeler * Sarah Crook - DC Johnstone * Ian Dunn - Trevor * Nick Burnell as Mr. Meadows * Marlene Sidaway as Mrs. Barker * Martin Crewes as Guy Cullen * Carl Brincat as Ian Ravenscroft * Tim Faraday as DS Hamilton * Clare Moody as Amanda Hunt * Dan Fredenburgh as Greg Hunt * John Rowe as Judge Shuttlewood * Dione Inman as Clerk of Court * Tom Cotcher as Mr. Jones * Bob Barrett as Mr. Levi * Adam Croft as TV reporter * Paula Bacon as Fiona * Andrew Grainger as Chris Bisset * Hugh Lee as Mike * Nick Clark as Newsreader * Sarah Neville as Mrs. Warner * Maxwell Hutcheon as Mr. Casey * Sam Halpenny as DS Culver * Rory MacGregor as PC Waterhouse * Joanne Mitchell as Jude Longley * Sara Lloyd as Jo * Jane How as Lady Myddleton * Mark Pegg as PO MacFarlane * Joy Elias-Rilwan as Interpreter * Juley McCann as Sheila * Rachel Bavidge as DST Officer * Shola Adewusi as Fatima Ibraham * Selva Rasalingam as DC Patel * Amanda Gordon as Dionne Clarke * Maureen Beattie as Marion McLoughlin * Danielle Lydon as Claire Walker * David Henry as Gordon Alexander * Bernard Gallagher as Judge Hardy * Beth Fitzgerald as Sally Ann Howe * Anna Maria Ashe as Newsreader * Alberto Banderas as Spanish policeman ==Episodes== ==Release== The third series of Bad Girls was originally released on VHS format in the UK, consisting of 5 volumes.
