His birth name was ,While the stage names of all kabuki actors have retained traditional order (Surname-Givenname) on Wikipedia, birth names of those born after the Meiji Restoration are in Western order (Givenname-Surname). and his name was legally changed several times, first to , and later to , separate from his performing name. Six months after his birth in Kyoto he became the adopted son of . He made his kabuki acting debut at the age of 15 under the name . In 1951 he was adopted by and was renamed as Ichikawa Raiz\u014d VIII. In 1954 he began a career as a film actor. He received breakout acclaim for his performance in Enj\u014d and received several awards for the performance including the Blue Ribbon Award and the Kinema Junpo Award, both for the category of Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role. Among his fans he was referred to lovingly as \"Rai-sama.\" In June 1968 he was diagnosed with and underwent surgery for rectal cancer, but it metastasized to his liver and he died the following year. Ichikawa Raiz\u014d appeared mostly in period dramas (jidaigeki). He is best known for the Sleepy Eyes of Death (Nemuri Kyoshir\u014d) series, Ninja (Shinobi no Mono) series and Nakano Spy School (Rikugun Nakano Gakk\u014d) series (based on the Nakano School). Raiz\u014d worked many times with director Kenji Misumi. Their collaborations include The Sword (Ken) (from a book by Yukio Mishima) and Destiny's Son (Kill!). Other great works include An Actor's Revenge (Yukinojo henge). He was so admired for his gracefulness that in his lifetime he was called \"the genius who thinks with his body.\" == Biography == === Birth and adoption by Ichikawa Kudanji III === Ichikawa Raiz\u014d was born in the Nakagy\u014d ward of Kyoto on August 29, 1931. At the time of his birth, he was named Akio Kamezaki. At six months of age he was adopted by Ichikawa Kudanji III, who renamed him Yoshio Takeuchi.\u96f7\u8535, \u96f7\u8535\u3092\u8a9e\u308b (Raiz\u014d, Raiz\u014d ga Kataru), Chronology. According to the film critic Rikiya Tayama, the details of his adoption are as follows: While Raiz\u014d's mother was pregnant, Raiz\u014d's father was transferred to Nara as an in the Imperial Japanese Army, leaving her behind at his family's home. She was persecuted by his family and attempted to reach out to him for help but was ignored. When she could no longer bear it she fled to her own family's home, where Raiz\u014d was born.Tayama 1988, pp. 14-15.\u30ce\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb\u66f8\u623f (N\u014dberu Shobo) (collected) 1991, p. 265. The relationship between her and her husband having deteriorated, Raizo's mother intended to raise him on her own. At this point she received repeated petitions from her husband's brother-in-law, Ichikawa Kudanji III, to allow him to raise the child. She initially refused these offers, but ultimately relented, and Raiz\u014d was officially adopted by Kudanji at the age of six months.Tayama 1988, pp. 15-17. Raiz\u014d was not aware of his adoption until he was 16 years old, and he did not meet his mother in person until he was 30.\u30ce\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb\u66f8\u623f (N\u014dberu Shobo) (collected) 1991 pp. 264-266. === Kabuki Debut (1934 \u2013 May 1949) === In 1934, about two years after his adoption by Ichikawa Kudanji III, Raiz\u014d moved from Kyoto to Osaka. Kudanji did not train him as a kabuki actor during his childhood,Ichikawa 1995 p. 16. but in 1946, when he was in his third and final year at Osaka Prefectural Tennoji High School, Raiz\u014d elected to withdraw from school to pursue an acting career.On the experience of becoming a kabuki actor, Raiz\u014d himself said that as he was on the verge of quitting junior high school and simply spending his time about the house instead, he got something of an interest in the world of kabuki and somehow ended up as a kabuki actor,\uff08Ichikawa 1995, pp. 16-18\uff09but in fact he had attempted to join the Japanese Imperial Navy as an officer or a doctor. His myopia made officership unattainable, and he ended up abandoning hope of becoming a doctor as well.\uff08Tayama 1988, p. 18, Hosaka 2001, p. 321\uff09Tayama 1988, p. 18.Hosaka 2001, p. 321. In November 1946, at the age of 15, Raiz\u014d made his kabuki debut at the Osaka Kabukiza theater under the name Ichikawa Enz\u014d III (Kudanji had previously used the name Ichikawa Enz\u014d II).\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306e\u96f7\u8535 (Watashi no Raiz\u014d), p. 260.Tayama 1988, pp. 18-19. His first role was the part of Lady Ohana (Musume Ohana) in the play Nakayamashichiri. In May 1949, a little over two years after his first performance, Raiz\u014d formed a study group with two other young kabuki performers. These were Rish\u014d Arashi (known later in his kabuki career as Arashi Kichisabur\u014d VIII, and as Yatar\u014d Kitagami in his acting career) and Nakamura Taro II. They called this group the , which can be translated as \"exhaustive meeting,\" and together they focused diligently on training. However, there was one obstacle that this training could not overcome: Kudanji had been the son of a member of a minor politician in Kyoto rather than a kabuki actor, and had only been apprenticed (to an actor known as Ichikawa Sadanji II) because of Kudanji's own strong desire to enter the world of kabuki. Thus Kudanji was forever labeled as a montei agari \u2013 someone born and raised outside of the kabuki world and its \"lineage\" and later apprenticed into it \u2013 and doomed never to exceed a supporting role.Tayama 1988, p. 17. That being the case, no matter how hard Raiz\u014d trained, he was unlikely to gain noteworthy roles as a kenmon performer as long as he remained the son of Kudanji. === Adoption by Ichikawa J\u016bkai III (June 1949 \u2013 June 1951) === Commemorative photo of Ichikawa Raiz\u014d VIII on the day of his adoption by Ichikawa Jukai III in April, 1951 In 1949, in the same period that Raiz\u014d was establishing the Tsukushikai, a kabuki theater director named Tetsuji Takechi was scouting for young, talented kabuki performers to join his traditionalist troupe, Tetsuji Kabuki.Takechi Kabuki\u2019s first production opened in December 1949. The members of the Tsukushikai participated in this troupe and thus made the acquaintance of Tetsuji. Tetsuji thought very highly of Raiz\u014d's acting talents, but realized that so long as he remained known as Kudanji's son he would never be able to truly shine in the world of kabuki and his talent would be wasted.\u30ce\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb\u66f8\u623f (N\u014dberu Shobo) (collected) 1991, p. 195. To that end Tetsuji formed a plan to have Raiz\u014d take the name of , which had been unused for a quarter century, but Nakamura Jakuemon III \u2013 who was no longer performing, but still alive \u2013 was dissatisfied with Raiz\u014d's thus-far inability to gain real recognition and refused to allow the name's use.Tayama 1988, p. 21-22. After that, it is known that Tetsuji intended to apprentice Raiz\u014d under the childless .\"I've heard that when Rokusuke Ei was a child, there was a plan to have him adopted by Ichikawa Jukai III. Ei refused, saying he didn't want to become a kabuki actor.\" (\u300c\u7de8\u96c6\u624b\u5e33\u300d(Hensh\u016b Tech\u014d) \u8aad\u58f2\u65b0\u805e (Dokubai Shimbun) September 6, 2014). In December 1950, Ichikawa Jukai III attended a meeting of the Tsukushikai in an observational capacity. He was highly impressed by Raiz\u014d's performance as Minamoto no Yoriie in the play Shuzenji Monogatari. Jukai had been the son of a kimono-maker and thus had had no connection to the world of kabuki through his lineage, but despite this, through great effort on his part, Jukai had become quite renowned in the Kansai kabuki scene during and after the Second World War. By the time he met Raiz\u014d in 1950, Jukai had become the president of the Kansai Kabuki Actors Guild, a position of great influence. Furthermore, the name \"Jukai\" had been bestowed upon Ichikawa Jukai III by both of the actors who had used it before: Ichikawa Danj\u016br\u014d VII and Ichikawa Danj\u016br\u014d IX; and he had even been granted usage of the and yag\u014d and kamon traditionally used by the head of the Ichikawa line.The \u201cKotobuki Ebi\u201d is currently used by Ichikawa Ebiz\u014d, representative of the Ichikawa line, as an alternative to his usual kamon as his acting symbol. With the help of some mutual friends, Tetsuji was successful in his efforts and Jukai agreed to officially adopt Raiz\u014d.Tayama 1988, pp. 22-23. At this point Jukai wished to give Raiz\u014d the name , a name with deep roots in the Ichikawa house stretching back to the 1600s, but the chief cabinet secretary of the Ichikawa house, Ichikawa En'\u014d II, viciously fought against this wish, stating \"We can't bestow a name with such deep family ties to some unknown performer from an unknown line.\"It was hoped that Ichikawa Shinz\u014d V, who was adopted by Ichikawa Danjur\u014d IX, would someday take the name \u201cIchikawa Danjur\u014d X,\u201d but he fell ill and died young, so this never came to pass. After long negotiations they finally settled on the name \"Ichikawa Raiz\u014d.\"Tayama 1988, p. 27. The adoption was finalized in April 1951, and the ceremony for the succession of the \"Ichikawa Raizo\" name was carried out in June of the same year.Tayama 1988, pp. 27-28.\u5e02\u5ddd1995, pp. 297-298. According to the film director Kazuo Ikehiro, around this time rumors began to circulate that Ichikawa Jukai III was actually Raiz\u014d's biological father.Muro'oka 1993, p. 208. Upon his second adoption Raiz\u014d's legal name was changed again as well, to Yoshiya \u014cta. This name was chosen by Raiz\u014d himself, as he was weary of being judged by his current family name.Muramatsu 2006, pp. 234-236. According to Akinari Suzuki, the studio president of Daiei Kyoto Studio, Raiz\u014d often advised those around him to consider changing their names, and it's said that some 20 to 30 people related to the film studio did so upon Raiz\u014d's recommendation. In fact, Masako Nagata, the woman Raiz\u014d would eventually marry, was originally named Ky\u014dko, and changed her given name after Raiz\u014d suggested she do so.Tayama 1988, p. 74. === Transition into Film Acting (July 1951 \u2013 1957) === Raiz\u014d became Jukai's adopted son in 1951, but Jukai believed that the 20-year-old Raiz\u014d was still too young to take on major roles and adopted a policy of only giving him minor roles for the time being.Tayama 1988, p. 28. As a result of this Raiz\u014d decided to pursue a film career in 1954 and joined the Daiei film studio.Tayama 1988, pp. 28-30. Regarding his transition to film acting, Raiz\u014d maintained that he did it simply because it seemed like a good opportunity and he wanted to try it out.\u5e02\u5ddd1995, pp. 20-21. Rikiya Tayama has said that the real reason was that Raiz\u014d, dissatisfied with the treatment he received over the years, was extremely upset when he was cast as an idiot without a single line in the Osaka Kabukiza's performance of K\u014dya Hijiri in June 1954,Raiz\u014d, who had been pining after a role in K\u014dyahijiri, said to Tetsuji Takechi, \u201cthanks to this, I\u2019ll be stuck as a supporting actor for all time.\u201d\uff08\u30ce\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb\u66f8\u623f (N\u014dberu Shobo) (Complete) 1991, 196.\uff09 and thus decided to leave the world of kabuki for good. Fortuitously he received an offer from Daiei Films who intended to position him as a star in their jidaigeki \u2013 period dramas \u2013 and accepted it, leaving the kabuki world for film.Tayama 1988, pp. 28-30. From that time forwards, Raiz\u014d only performed in a single kabuki play: the January 1964 production of Kanjinch\u014d directed by Tetsuji Takechi at the newly completed Nissay Theater, in which he played Yasuie Togashi. On that occasion Raiz\u014d said, \"In Kabuki you're no good unless you're old. In film you're no good once you're old. While I'm still young I'll make a living in film, once I've gotten older I'll try kabuki again.\"Tayama 1988, pp. 76-77. Once he had decided to pursue a film career, Raiz\u014d began to frequent the movie theater to study the performances of Yorozuya Kinnosuke in jidaigeki produced by Toei.Hosaka 2001, p. 324. Raiz\u014d made his film debut on August 25, 1954 in The Great White Tiger Platoon (Hana no Byakkotai). While Raiz\u014d had been held back in the world of kabuki by the circumstances of his parentage, he was treated with great respect in the world of film, as the son of Ichikawa Jukai III, president of the Kanto Kabuki Guild. Daiei's management intended to position Raiz\u014d as a successor to the popular Kazuo Hasegawa, and gave Raiz\u014d the starring role in his fifth and sixth films, The Young Swordsman (Shiode Kushima Binan Kenp\u014d), released December 22, 1954, and The Second Son (Jinanb\u014d Garasu), released January 29, 1955.Tayama 1988, pp. 34-35. In 1955, two years after his film debut, Raiz\u014d received great attention for his portrayal of Taira no Kiyomori in director Kenji Mizoguchi's Shin Heike Monogatari, released on September 21 of that year. Tokuz\u014d Tanaka, director of 16 of Raiz\u014d's films, stated that at first it seemed as though it would be difficult to make Raiz\u014d into a great success, but that impression changed instantly with Shin Heike Monogatari.Muro'oka 1993, p. 102. Kazuo Ikehiro, who directed another 16 of Raiz\u014d's films, said that until that point it had seemed that Raiz\u014d was simply imitating Kazuo Hasegawa, but bit by bit his innate acting talent had begun to shine through.Muro'oka 1993, p. 210. The film critic Tadao Sato wrote that until now Raiz\u014d had \"portrayed only handsome young samurai and yakuza, as though following in the footsteps of Kazuo Hasegawa\" but that now he \"has come to be a distinguished actor worthy of high praise, giving fresh performances in elegant dramas, rather than only performing in chanbara \u2013 samurai films with an action focus.Sat\u014d 2006, p. 298. In the wake of Shin Heike Monogatari, Raiz\u014d performed in over 10 films released in the period of a single year. He worked tirelessly, giving up holidays and weekends to continue filming.Tayama 1988, p. 47. Raiz\u014d had weak legs, and would often become faint when standing or walking.Tayama 1988, p. 34.Muro'oka 1993, pp. 254, 270. Masayoshi Tsuchida, then head of Daiei's planning department, said that it must have been an incredible adventure to play \"Kiyomori, the youth who pierced the heavens\" for the physically frail Raiz\u014d. Raiz\u014d was self-conscious about the weakness of his legs and joined the sumo club at Doshisha University in an attempt to train and strengthen them, but it was no use. Whenever photos were taken of Raiz\u014d, the photography staff took special precautions to frame the shot in such a way as to avoid showing Raiz\u014d's weak legs.Muro'oka 1993, p. 254.\u30ce\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb\u66f8\u623f (N\u014dberu Shobo) (Complete) 1991, pp. 282-283. According to Kenji Misumi, director of 18 of Raiz\u014d's films, Raiz\u014d deeply loathed the physical frailty of his body, but when he finally managed to overcome that loathing and accept himself he became capable of incredible composure. === Rise to Stardom (1958 \u2013 May 1968) === In 1958 Kon Ichikawa cast Raiz\u014d in the lead role of the film Enj\u014d, based on the novel The Temple of the Golden Pavilion by Yukio Mishima. The film was released on August 19 of that year. According to Ichikawa, Hiroshi Kawaguchi was originally intended for the role, but Ichikawa argued against this selection based on an instinctive feeling that Raiz\u014d was the right choice for the role and ultimately succeeded in convincing the studio president, Masaichi Nagata, to cast Raiz\u014d instead.Muro'oka 1993, pp. 11-12. There was some resistance within the studio, as it was felt that a newcomer with a stammer should not be given such a large role in his second film with the studio,Muro'oka 1993, pp. 12, 271. but he was ultimately given the part, stating \"we need to give the young actor Ichikawa Raiz\u014d a chance if we want to make him into a success.\"Ichikawa 1995, p. 32. Raiz\u014d rose to the occasion and gave an excellent performance. Ichikawa praised Raiz\u014d's acting, saying \"I give it a perfect score, 100 of 100. There's simply nothing else to say.\"Muro'oka 1993, p. 23. It's often said that Raiz\u014d's performance in Enj\u014d reflected his childhood. Ichikawa said, \"He's expressing something of his true self through his performance,\" and \"He's overcome something through his acting ... some sort of burden he had been carrying; and his indescribable life can be seen in his expression.\"Muro'oka 1993, pp. 17-18. Tokuz\u014d Tanaka said that Raiz\u014d's complicated childhood had caused something like a base part of his heart to emerge, merging with and adding depth to his performance.Muro'oka 1993, p. 107. Kazuo Ikehiro said that precisely because of this \"hidden part of his childhood,\" or \"base part of his heart,\" that Raiz\u014d was perfectly equipped for the performance.Muro'oka 1993, pp. 206-208. Once, when a member of the Daiei planning department named Hisakazu Tsuji mused aloud that he felt as though his performance in Enj\u014d reflected Raiz\u014d's childhood, Raiz\u014d did not refute it.Tayama 1988, p. 57. For his performance in Enj\u014d, Raiz\u014d received the Kinema Junpo Award for best male actor in a leading role, and the Blue Ribbon Award for best performer in a leading role, among others. Raiz\u014d's position as a star had been secured.Tayama 1988, pp. 54-57. The Nemuri Kyoshir\u014d series of films, which began in 1963 and are known as Sleepy Eyes of Death in the west, are considered to be the representative work of Raiz\u014d's later years. According to Tokuz\u014d Tanaka, playing the part of the protagonist, Kyoshir\u014d, was an extreme challenge for Raiz\u014d. Speaking of the first film in the series, Sapp\u014dch\u014d, even Raiz\u014d himself said that \"the characteristic 'hollowness' of Kyoshir\u014d simply didn't come out at all\" and deemed the film a failure.Ichikawa 1995, pp. 218-220. It wasn't until the fourth film, Joy\u014dken, that Raiz\u014d succeeded in bringing the hollowness, dandyism and nihilism of the character to life.Muro'oka 1993, p. 113-116. The actor Shintar\u014d Katsu described Raiz\u014d's performance in the Nemuri Kyoshir\u014d films, saying \"When he was playing Kyoshir\u014d he had a real animal magnetism about him, didn't he. Maybe you could say it came from this sense of the shadow of death hanging over him. It really is the face people make when they die, that expression.\" \u201cWhen he\u2019d walk by, Rai-chan would cut you with his face. Not with a sword, with his face,\u201d he reminisced, \u201cRai-chan didn\u2019t become Kyoshir\u014d through his fight scenes or the delivery of his lines, he did it through his face; that\u2019s my opinion, anyway.\u201dMuro'oka 1993, p. 256. Kazuo Ikehiro said, \u201cwithout speaking, without any kind of facial expression, simply by the way he walked around as though he were carrying his past on his back\u201dTayama 1988, pp. 72-73. Akira Inoue, director of the seventh film in the series, Taj\u014dken, said that there were other actors who played Kyoshir\u014d, but none of them could compare to Raiz\u014d when it came to portraying Kyoshir\u014d's soul.Hosaka 2001, pp. 328-329. Raiz\u014d went on to hold the starring role in 12 films in the series, which represents a majority of the starring roles for which Raiz\u014d was cast. According to Kazuo Ikehiro, as Raiz\u014d's experience as an actor accumulated he began to desire to take a larger role in film creation through directing. Ikehiro advised Raiz\u014d to pursue the role of producer, rather than director, as he would then be able to make decisions about subject matter, scripts, and casting in addition to direction.\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306e\u96f7\u8535 (Watashi no Raiz\u014d), pp. 38-39. In January 1968, Raiz\u014d said \u201cI want to assemble a new dramatic production, the likes of which has never been seen before,\u201d and began the process of establishing a new theater company called \u201cTeatoro Kaburaya\u201d at which he would take a producer role, but as soon as it was founded he fell ill and the company never began operations.\u30ce\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb\u66f8\u623f (N\u014dberu Shobo) (Complete) 1991, pp. 325-333. According to Seiji Hoshikawa, director of 14 of Raiz\u014d's films, Raiz\u014d said to Hoshikawa and Kenji Misumi, \u201cCinema might not have that much time left. Let\u2019s stage a play sometime, the three of us. Let\u2019s give a new job a shot,\u201d and more specifically \u201cLet\u2019s try to capture Kawatake Mokuami\u2019s works through a modern lens.\u201dHosaka 2001, pp. 319. === The Final Years and Premature Death at Age 37 (June 1968 \u2013 July 17th, 1969) === In June 1968, while in the process of filming Seki no Yatappe, Raiz\u014d visited a doctor because of bloody stool, and was soon admitted to the hospital.Tayama 1988, p. 86. The results of his examinations clearly indicated rectal cancer, but the diagnosis was not made known to Raiz\u014d.\u014cta 2009 (\"Bungeishunj\u016b\" May 2009 special issue, p. 361.) On August 10, Raiz\u014d underwent surgery and was released from the hospital, but his family received a prognosis from his doctor stating that Raiz\u014d would \u201crelapse in about half a year.\u201d Raiz\u014d had possessed a weak digestive system from birth,Tayama 1988, p. 58. and had previously visited a doctor for the same symptoms in January 1961, after filming Kutsukake Tokijir\u014d. At that time he had been told simply that \u201cthere is a wound in the rectum\u201d when examined. There's also a record of him confiding to Tetsuji Takechi, \u201cI\u2019m tormented by diarrhea,\u201d in 1964, at the occasion of his performance of Kanjinch\u014d at the Nissay Theater.Tayama 1988, p. 79. After leaving the hospital, Raizo performed in the films Nemuri Ky\u014dshir\u014d: Akujo-gari (released January 11, 1969), and Bakuto Ichidai: Chimatsuri Fud\u014d (released February 12, 1969), but his physical strength was rapidly dwindling, and they had to resort to a body double with voice-over for all of his scenes involving walking and movement.Muramatsu 2006, p. 243. In February 1969, complaining of physical unwellness, Raiz\u014d was admitted to the hospital once again. After his second surgery Raiz\u014d was so weak that he couldn't swallow soup,\u592a\u75302009(\"'Bungeishunj\u016b'\" May 2009 special issue, p. 362.\uff09 but he deeply wished to play the role of a naval officer in the film Aa, Kaigun, and began talks with people related to the film. His recovery was not complete by the time filming began, and Daiei cast Nakamura Kichiemon II as a substitute in order to begin filming. After learning of the recast by reading it in the newspaper, Raiz\u014d never again spoke about work.Muramatsu 2006, p. 260. He died several months later, on July 17, of liver cancer, at the age of 37. His funeral was held on July 23, at the Ikegami Honmon-ji temple in the \u014cta ward of Tokyo. His grave is at the same temple. It has been said that in the time before his death, Raiz\u014d deliriously entreated that nobody be allowed to see his face when he died.\u30ce\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb\u66f8\u623f (N\u014dberu Shobo) (Complete) 1991, p. 257. His wife, Masako \u014cta, staunchly denies these claims, stating \u201cRaiz\u014d never gave up on recovery, even until the end; he never even wrote a will.\u201d\u592a\u75302009(\"'Bungeishunj\u016b'\" May 2009 special issue, p. 362-363.\uff09 Nevertheless, after his death Raiz\u014d's face was wrapped in two layers of white cloth, which remained in place even as he was cremated.Tayama 1988, pp. 6-7. According to Masako, Raiz\u014d had said only \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to see how dreadfully thin I've become,\u201d and because of that wish she had not allowed anyone aside from his adopted father, Jukai, and his company president, Nagata, to see his face after his death. Raiz\u014d's final film, Bakuto Ichidai: Chimatsuri Fud\u014d, was an example of the then-popular ninky\u014d eiga \u2013 pro-yakuza films \u2013 produced by Toei Studios. Raiz\u014d was reluctant to participate, saying \u201cShould I just reheat the scraps left by K\u014dji Tsuruta?\u201d \u2013 Tsurata being an actor well known for performing in such films \u2013 but Masayoshi Tsuchiya convinced him, saying \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you get the next role you want to play.\u201d The following year Tsuchiya expressed deep regret that this role which Raiz\u014d had not wanted to play had become his last. In 1971, two years after Raiz\u014d's death, Daiei Studios filed for bankruptcy. Seiji Hoshikawa reflected on this, saying \u201cRaiz\u014d\u2019s death was a precursor to Daiei\u2019s bankruptcy.\u201dMuro'oka 1993, p. 122. === Raiz\u014d's Legacy (July 17, 1969 \u2013 Present) === Raiz\u014d and Jukai's names can be seen inscribed on this t\u014dr\u014d, which is located at the Yasaka Shrine in Gion, Kyoto.In 1974, five years after Raiz\u014d's death, a fan club called \u201cRaiz\u014d- kai\u201d was formed.\u308f\u305f\u3057\u306e\u96f7\u8535 (Watashi no Raiz\u014d), Foreword and colophon. This fan club is still functioning as of this writing in 2012. According to Masaki Matsubara, once president of Daiei Kyoto Studios, Raiz\u014d's fans were drawn in by his acting and his humanity, and thus, unlike many other stars of the time, his fanbase had the rare characteristic of having many intelligent and educated female fans. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see the type that only squealed and caused a big fuss,\u201d he said.Hosaka 2001, p. 311. The \u201cIchikawa Raizo Film Festival,\u201d in which a selection of his films are shown, became an annual event, held each year on the anniversary of his death, July 17. From December 2009 until May 2011 an especially large event was held and his performances were screened to commemorate the 40th anniversary of his passing. In 2000, Kinema Junp\u014d published an article titled \u201cFilm Stars of the 20th Century: Male Actors.\u201d Raiz\u014d placed 6th. In the same issue's \u201cReaders\u2019 Choice: Male Film Stars of the 20th Century\" he was ranked 7th. In the 2014 list of \u201cAll Time Best Japanese Film Stars\u201d he was ranked 3rd in the list of male actors. In a 2014 blog post, Ichikawa Ebiz\u014d XI implied that the honorific name Ichikawa Raiz\u014d was under his care, and thus it can be seen as having been returned to the Ichikawa house and line following Raiz\u014d's death. == Family == Raiz\u014d married Masako Nagata, daughter of Masaichi Nagata, in a private wedding ceremony in 1962.\u592a\u75302009(\"'Bungeishunj\u016b'\" May 2009 special issue, p. 357.\uff09 She took his name, becoming Masako \u014cta, and they had three children together.\u592a\u75302009(\"'Bungeishunj\u016b'\" May 2009 special issue, p. 358.\uff09 Raiz\u014d had told Masako \u201cI never want [my family] in the public eye,\u201d when he was alive,Hosaka 2001, p. 332. and she continued to uphold his wishes after his death\u592a\u75302009(\"'Bungeishunj\u016b'\" May 2009 special issue, p. 354.\uff09 until 40 years had passed, when a special issue of Bungeishunj\u016b was published in 2009, featuring a memoir by Masako \u014cta titled \u201cA love letter to my husband, Ichikawa Raizo, 40 years later.\u201d == Awards == Data taken from \u201c\u96f7\u8535, \u96f7\u8535\u3092\u8a9e\u308b\u201d (Raiz\u014d, Raiz\u014d ga Kataru) * January 1959: Kinema Junp\u014d \u2013 Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role (Enj\u014d) * February 1959: Blue Ribbon Award \u2013 Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role, NHK Film \u2013 Excellence in a Male Leading Role (Enj\u014d, Benten Koz\u014d) * September 1959: Cinema Nuovo \u2013 Excellence in a Male Role (Enj\u014d) * November 1964: Tokyo Citizens\u2019 Film Festival \u2013 Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role (Ken) * February 1967: NHK Film \u2013 Excellence in a Male Leading Role, Kinema Junp\u014d \u2013 Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role (Hanaoka Seish\u016b no Tsuma) * November 1968: Tokyo Citizens\u2019 Film Festival \u2013 Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role (Hanaoka Seish\u016b no Tsuma) * November 1969: Tokyo Citizens\u2019 Film Festival \u2013 Makino Sh\u014dz\u014d Prize == Acclaim == === Acting === The screenwriter Fuji Yahiro said of Raiz\u014d's manners, \u201cRegardless of to whom he was speaking, he was always polite and proper, without arrogance or effusive emotion,\u201d and that shone through in his acting style. According to Yahiro, \u201cEven among the great number of jidaigeki actors, nobody else had his good manners \u2013 and I mean that in a good way \u2013 not a single other actor felt like a true bushi-like swordsman the way he did.\u201d\u30ce\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb\u66f8\u623f (N\u014dberu Shobo) (Complete) 1991, p. 245. Kazuo Ikehiro said that Raiz\u014d's childhood cast a \u201cshadow of heartlessness\u201d over him, and because of that a \u201cshadowed part\u201d and a \u201ctrue background part\" of his life were exposed. Moreover, they were not merely exposed, but thrust forward willfully, in Ikehiro's estimation. Kazuo Mori, the director with whom Raiz\u014d produced the greatest number of films, said that Raizo carried \u201ca human pain of which he didn\u2019t speak to anyone\u201d which he sublimated into each of his performances.Hosaka 2001, p. 325. In an interview between Mori and the film critic Sadao Yamane, the two agreed that Raiz\u014d had a \u201crefreshing sorrow\u201d about him. Yamane explained this further, saying \u201cwhile it\u2019s true that he played a great many tragic roles, it wasn\u2019t simply with a dark depression or gloom; he had a very crisp presentation. There wasn\u2019t a single other actor who was equipped with both this sorrow and this cool crispness the way that Raiz\u014d was.\u201d Tadao Sat\u014d said of Raiz\u014d's acting, that whether in jidaigeki or in modern dramas, \u201cwhether the most miserable role or the most comedic, he acted with elegance and lent sophistication and grace to the final product.\u201dSat\u014d 2006, p. 368. Film critic Sabur\u014d Kawamoto said of Raiz\u014d's acting, \u201ceven when he\u2019s here, he\u2019s not here,\u201d and clarified, \u201ceven in this filthy world, there was a sense of purity about him, as though he were a glimpse into a faraway place.\u201d \u201cSome people might take my saying \u2018sense of purity\u2019 as some sort of posturing phrase, but it's not.\u201dKawamoto 2005, p. 164. Two of Raiz\u014d\u2019s contemporaries, Sakata T\u014dj\u016br\u014d IV and Nakamura Jakuemon IV, also attempted to change careers from kabuki to film, but failed to find success and returned to the kabuki stage. When asked his thoughts on this, Akinari Suzuki said that he felt that Raiz\u014d had found success in film because he was not steeped in kabuki in his young childhood, and thus avoided being totally stained by it.Muro'oka 1993, p. 390. === Appearance === Raiz\u014d usually looked plain, not eye-catching, but when his makeup was applied for a film shoot he would completely transform. Many people in the film industry spoke about this particular quirk. According to Arashi Ichikawa, Raiz\u014d\u2019s essence was \u201chardness divided by simplicity,\u201d and in stark contrast to other stars when playing their popular characters, Raiz\u014d's unmade-up simplicity \u201cwould transform completely with makeup,\u201d he said of this peculiar quirk.Muro'oka 1993, pp. 12-13, 48-50. According to Akira Inoue, when given makeup Raiz\u014d's usual appearance would become completely different and beautiful. \u201cMakeup would change him so suddenly, to the point where you\u2019d say \u2018woah! Who\u2019s this?\u2019\u201d he said.\u30ce\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb\u66f8\u623f (N\u014dberu Shobo) (Complete) 1991, p. 287. Toku\u014d Tanaka said, \u201cthis guy, with his disarming warmth and aura of purity; as soon as work began he\u2019d transform into an actor, he\u2019d stiffen his shoulders and become immediately commanding, steadfast, dignified and strikingly good-looking. For someone like me who knew his usual face, it was so surprising that it made my eyes pop open.\u201d According to Inoue, at the time of his debut, Raiz\u014d, along with Shintar\u014d Katsu and Takeshi Hanayagi, received makeup instruction from the star Kazuo Hasegawa. The other two actors applied their makeup exactly as told, but Raiz\u014d alone had a number of points where he made personal alterations to the makeup plan. In particular, Raiz\u014d's original designs could be seen in the makeup around his eyes and eyebrows. Furthermore, Raiz\u014d carried out the most important points of his makeup application himself, and wouldn't allow anyone to see him while doing it. Inoue theorizes that the application of makeup was a crucial part of his process for immersing himself in a role, and thus he didn't want to be observed while doing so.Hosaka 2001, pp. 327-328. Yoshio Shirasaki, screenwriter of K\u014dshoku Ichidai Otoko (First-generation Lecher), said of Raiz\u014d's transformation that he normally looked like a company man, but \u201cwhen he appeared on the screen he\u2019d have undergone a complete change; and in the midst of all the light was this youthful star, fighting against emptiness and loneliness.\u201d\u30ce\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb\u66f8\u623f (N\u014dberu Shobo) (Complete) 1991, p. 258. Inoue said that the reason that so many of Raiz\u014d's movie posters feature an image of him from behind with his head turned to face the camera was because many directors felt that this view of him best showed off his \"intriguing emptiness\".Hosaka 2001, p. 328. == Parallels and Comparison to Shintar\u014d Katsu == Raiz\u014d, Ayako Wakao, and Shintaro Katsu (1959) Raiz\u014d, as written above, was the son of Ichikawa Kudanji III, a supporting actor by trade, and for a time was known as Ichikawa Enz\u014d II. Shintar\u014d Katsu was the son of Kineya Katsut\u014dji, a nagauta performer and shamisen player, and for a time was known as Kineya Katsumaru II. Both Raiz\u014d and Katsu signed on with Daiei in 1954, and joined the company in the same term. Both born in 1931, having made a hurried transition from kabuki to the new world of film, there were many similar circumstances about the pair of young actors. As previously mentioned, Daiei's management intended from the start to position Raiz\u014d as a successor to the star Kazuo Hasegawa,Tayama 1988, pp. 34-35. and it \u201cproceeded smoothly along the tracks.\u201dMuramatsu 2005, p. 78. Tokuz\u014d Tanaka shared the opinion that Katsu, who was the first of the two to make his debut, was \u201clike a second helping of Hasegawa\u201d when he played an attractive young man in his white-faced film makeup;Muro'oka 1993, pp. 103-104. but as the director and supporting cast could hardly be described as first-rate, it was a long time before Katsu managed to become a real success.Muramatsu 2006, pp. 99-100. It wasn't until the 1960s and the release and success of the Akumy\u014d and Zatoichi series that Katsu became widely discussed and surpassed Raiz\u014d in earnings.Muramatsu 2006, pp. 94, 100-101, 134-135. Akinari Suzuki said of Katsu, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until after shooting 70 or 80 films without a single real hit, that he finally became of use with the release of Akumy\u014d.\u201dMuro'oka 1993, p. 393. According to Tokuz\u014d Tanaka, audience reception to Shiranui Kengy\u014d, released in 1960, was particularly terrible, despite Katsu's highly acclaimed performance, to the point that Tanaka received complaints from movie theater owners about his constant use of Katsu in his films.Muramatsu 2006, p. 99. Reflecting on the state of things in 1959, Katsu said \u201cThe banzuke was totally different,\u201d referring to the document listing sumo wrestlers\u2019 ranks before a tournament. \u201cWe already knew that Raiz\u014d was an \u014dzeki or a yokozuna. I still hadn\u2019t entered the san\u2019yaku,\u201d meaning that Raiz\u014d could be considered to be among the very highest regarded stars, while Katsu was still a relative unknown.Muro'oka 1993, p. 228. Eventually the pair became treated as a unit, with the name \u201cKATSURAISU,\u201d taking Katsu's surname and the first half of Raiz\u014d's given name to create a name which happened to sound like the food dish \u201ckatsu rice.\u201dHosaka 2001, p. 309. When the two appeared on movie posters and in films together under this slogan, they were often made to appear in contrast to one another in their appearance and style, and it was widely believed that there was a strong rivalry between them. However, their usage of friendly nicknames like \u201cRai-chan\u201d and \u201cKatchan\u201d for each other indicates that their relationship certainly wasn't bad, and in fact might even have been quite friendly. In fact, Raiz\u014d had a close friendship with Katsu's wife, Tamao Nakamura, from childhood, as her father, Nakamura Kanjir\u014d II, was a Kansai-based kabuki actor like Raiz\u014d's adopted fathers.\u5e02\u5ddd1995, p. 264. The author Tomomi Muramatsu indicated that for Raizo, who had \u201cworriedly spent his days in the world of kabuki, which is so dominated by lineage and ceremony, without ever receiving a large role,\u201dMuramatsu 2005, p. 82. and Katsu, whose father had been involved in the backstage world of kabuki,Muramatsu 2005, p. 86. shared \u201cthe same complex, this large problem to be solved,\u201d and that they were both equipped with \u201ca similar factor which served as a sort of energy source\u201d for them. ; Acting Style and Ability : Raiz\u014d was known for constantly offering all manner of suggestions during the pre-production process, and thus acquired the nickname \u201cGoterai,\u201d seemingly a pun on goteru, a Japanese word meaning \u201cto fuss about, to harp on.\u201d However, once he was satisfied in his understanding, he never complained or grumbled, and once filming began he would stop making these sorts of suggestions altogether.Tayama 1988, p. 36.Muro'oka 1993, p. 104.\u30ce\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb\u66f8\u623f (N\u014dberu Shobo) (Complete) 1991, pp. 243-244.Muramatsu 2006, pp. 102-103, 137. On the other hand, Katsu would go through the entire pre- production phase without saying a word, but start making suggestions and impromptu changes as soon as filming began which was a frequent source of trouble for the staff of his films.Muro'oka 1993, pp. 104-106.Muramatsu 2006, p. 103. : According to Akira Inoue, Raiz\u014d was quite capable of working together with the methodologies of various directors when acting. For example, even within the same Nemuri Ky\u014djiro series, the films made under different directors are said to have a different flavor to them. On the other hand he said when speaking of Katsu, \u201cWhen it comes to Zatoichi, it\u2019s Katchan\u2019s Zatoichi, in all of them.\u201dMuro'oka 1993, pp. 265-266. Akinari Suzuki has made similar statements regarding the two actors.Muramatsu 2006, pp. 135-136. Tomomi Muramatsu, said that Katsu was the kind of actor where \u201cno matter what he does, it always ends up in the vein of Shintar\u014d Katsu,\u201d but that Raiz\u014d, even though he was established as a mainstream Japanese film star in the ranks of Kazuo Hasegawa and Chiez\u014d Kataoka, would always be very flexible and receptive to direction, which was highly unusual for the stars of that era.Muramatsu 2005, pp. 84-85. : Tokuz\u014d Tanaka, who directed films with both actors, compared their fighting scenes speaking largely favorably of Raiz\u014d, \u201chis lower body always feels somewhat undetermined, but despite that his movement is quite real enough;\u201d but he had to declare Katsu the superior of the two, saying \u201cKatchan is just unbelievably agile.\u201dMuro'oka 1993, p. 118. ; Personality : According to Kazuo Ikehiro, even when working with someone he didn\u2019t like, Katsu could \u201cusually manage to get along,\u201d but \u201cwhen [Raiz\u014d] disliked someone, he disliked them completely\u201d to the point where there had been cases when he had said \u201cI don\u2019t even want to see your face\u201d directly to someone. Ikehiro said that Raiz\u014d was particularly bothered by people who took their jobs lightly and did sloppy work.Muro'oka 1993, p. 208. : Speaking of their interactions with other film staff Yoshinobu Nishioka, who worked as a production designer on many of Daiei\u2019s films, said that Katsu was the sort to go out drinking with other actors, while Raiz\u014d would often socialize with the production staff.Muramatsu 2006, p. 90. Tokuz\u014d Tanaka corroborates, saying that Raiz\u014d was incredibly friendly and helpful with the staff, often inviting people to his home for dinner and other such activities.Muro'oka 1993, p. 106. According to Seiji Hoshikawa, Raiz\u014d didn\u2019t much like \u201cglitzy and neon-decked or famous restaurants,\u201d but instead \u201cwould nearly always eat regular restaurants, without any regards to social standing,\u201d where he would \u201chappily argue and discuss life and films.\u201dHosaka 2001, p. 320. : Fujio Morita, who served as cinematographer on Raiz\u014d\u2019s Nemuri Kyoshir\u014d: Enj\u014d-ken and Katsu\u2019s Zatoichi: Nitan-kiri at about the same time, said of their personalities that Raiz\u014d was very diligent and serious, while describing Katsu as desperate.Muro'oka 1993, p. 300. ==Filmography== The filmography of Ichikawa Raiz\u014d includes 158 films:http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/person/p0154900.htm accessed 22 January 2009 ===1950s=== (1950s is complete) * 1954: * 1954: * 1954: * 1954: * 1954: * 1955: * 1955: * 1955: * 1955: a.k.a.
