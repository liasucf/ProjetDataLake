    "text": "Haliotis squamosa, common name the squamose abalone, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Haliotidae, the abalones. ==Description== The size of the shell varies between 40 mm and 90 mm. \"The shell has an oblong-ovate shape, transversely obliquely wrinkled and spirally tubularly ribbed. The tubercles are scale-like. The ribs are sometimes close, sometimes with a fine ridge running between them. The seven, open perforations are rather large. The exterior is spotted and variegated with yellow and orange-brown. The interior surface is whitish and iridescent. This is an extremely interesting species, well characterized by its close ribs of scale- like tubercles, ranging across the shell in oblique waves. In the middle portion of the shell there is a fine ridge running between the ribs. The color is also peculiar, a kind of burnt-umberstained orange.\" H.A. Pilsbry (1890) Manual of Conchology XII; Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, 1890 ==Distribution== This species occurs in the Indian Ocean off southern Madagascar. Gray erroneously described the species to occur off Australia. ==References== * Gray, Appendix to King's Survey of the Intertropical and Western Coasts of Australia ii, p. 494, 1826. * Geiger D.L. & Owen B.
