    "text": "Elias Higbee (October 23, 1795 \u2013 June 8, 1843) was an associate of Joseph Smith, a prominent Danite, and an official historian and recorder in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. ==Biography== Born in Galloway Township, New Jersey to Isaac Higbee and Sophia Somers, Higbee joined the Latter Day Saint church in 1832 in Ohio.\"Elias Higbee\" , The Joseph Smith Papers, josephsmithpapers.org (accessed January 9, 2012). He and his family joined the gathering of Latter Day Saints in Kirtland, Ohio, later that year. In 1833 the Higbees and other Latter Day Saints attempted to settle in Jackson County, Missouri, but were forced to return to Kirtland in 1835. They again tried to settle in Missouri in 1836, this time in Clay County. While in Missouri, Higbee was a Caldwell County judge and a leading officer of the county militia. Eventually, the events of the 1838 Mormon War again forced the Higbees to leave Missouri and by 1839 they had settled with the majority of Latter-Day Saints in Commerce, Illinois, which would later be renamed Nauvoo. In 1838, Higbee became the official historian of the church, and in 1840 he became the church's recorder. In 1839 and 1840, Higbee traveled with Joseph Smith to Washington, D.C. to submit a petition for redress to U.S. President Martin Van Buren.Gary James Bergera, \"Buckeye's Laments: Two Early Insider Expos\u00e9s of Mormon Polygamy and their Authorship\", Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society, Winter 2003. On October 8, 1840, Higbee was appointed by Smith to the committee charged with organizing the construction of the Nauvoo Temple.Joseph Smith (B.H. Roberts ed.) 1902. History of the Church 5:421. Higbee unexpectedly died of cholera in 1843 in Nauvoo. After his death, Smith stated that Higbee \"will again come forth and strike hands with the faithful, and share the glory of the kingdom of God for ever and ever.\" He was married to Sarah Elizabeth Ward and was the father of twelve children. ==Higbee's questions in the Doctrine and Covenants== In the Doctrine and Covenants, part of the scriptural canon of several denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement, answers to several questions about the meaning of the Book of Isaiah posed by Higbee to Joseph Smith are reproduced and have been canonized: > Questions by Elias Higbee: What is meant by the command in Isaiah, 52d > chapter, 1st verse, which saith: Put on thy strength, O Zion\u2014and what people > had Isaiah reference to? [Answer:] He had reference to those whom God should > call in the last days, who should hold the power of priesthood to bring > again Zion, and the redemption of Israel; and to put on her strength is to > put on the authority of the priesthood, which she, Zion, has a right to by > lineage; also to return to that power which she had lost. What are we to > understand by Zion loosing herself from the bands of her neck; 2d verse? We > are to understand that the scattered remnants are exhorted to return to the > Lord from whence they have fallen; which if they do, the promise of the Lord > is that he will speak to them, or give them revelation. See the 6th, 7th, > and 8th verses. The bands of her neck are the curses of God upon her, or the > remnants of Israel in their scattered condition among the Gentiles.Doctrine > and Covenants 113:7-10 (LDS Church ed.). This exchange has not been included > in the version of the Doctrine and Covenants used by the Community of > Christ. ==Notes== |- ! colspan=\"3\" style=\"border-top: 5px solid #FABE60;\" | Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints |- | Succeeded by Willard Richards |- |- Category:1795 births Category:1843 deaths Category:Danites Category:Latter Day Saints from Illinois Category:Latter Day Saints from Missouri Category:Latter Day Saints from Ohio Category:Leaders in the Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints) Category:Missouri state court judges Category:Official historians of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Category:People from Galloway Township, New Jersey Category:Religious leaders from New Jersey ",
