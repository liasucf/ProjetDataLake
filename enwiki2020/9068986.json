    "text": "Paul Francis Knitter (born 1939) was the Paul Tillich Professor of Theology, World Religions and Culture at Union Theological Seminary, New York City. He continues as the Emeritus Professor of Theology, World Religions and Culture. He was formerly Emeritus Professor of Theology at Xavier University in Cincinnati. Since publishing his book, No Other Name? (1985), Knitter has been widely known for his religious pluralism. Along with his friend and colleague, the Protestant philosopher of religion John Hick, Knitter came under criticism from Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, later known as Pope Benedict XVI. In 1984 he was one of 97 theologians and religious persons who signed A Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion, calling for pluralism and discussion within the Catholic Church regarding the church's position on abortion. ==Early life and education== Knitter was born on February 25, 1939, in Chicago, Illinois. He holds a licentiate from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome (1966), as well as a doctorate from the University of Marburg, Germany (1972). ==Works== ===Thesis=== * ===Books=== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ===Critiques from within Paul Knitter's native Catholic tradition=== In reference to Paul Knitter's Jesus and the Other Names (Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1996), Catherine Cornille, when addressing Knitter's claim that Jesus is not the \"only\" savior, comments: \"Not only are the religious views of different traditions at times directly opposed or mutually exclusive, but the very claim of ultimacy of one religion necessarily precludes the truth of the claims of others.\"Catherine Cornille, The im- Possibility of Interreligious Dialogue, New York, NY: Crossroad Publishing, 2008, p.87. In reference to Knitter's Without Buddha I Could Not Be a Christian (Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 2009), [Rev.] James L. Fredericks declares: \"Nowhere are we given to believe that there are some respects in which Buddhists and Christians are simply baffling to one another because their religious visions are incompatible. I also worry that the more Buddhism is enlisted into service of Christian faith as an ancilla theologiae [handmaid to theology], the less it seems like Buddhism.\"J. Fredericks' pertaining review entitled \"The Lotus Position,\" Commonweal Magazine, April 5th, 2010. In reference to Without Buddha I Could Not Be a Christian, Robert Magliola asserts, in the Journal of the American Academy of Religion (JAAR)R. Magliola's pertaining review in JAAR, Vol. 78, No. 4 (Dec., 2010), pp. 1215-1218. that Paul Knitter \"is not Catholic enough because he is not Buddhist enough and vice versa.\" Quoting [Rev.] Francis Xavier Clooney, S.J.'s statement, in Clooney's Jesuit Postmodern (2006, p. 165) that comparisons \"seem not to fit into a single, coherent view,\" Magliola points out that Knitter's proposed \"one universal Spirit\" perpetuates the outdated modernist notion of \"equable holism\" or \"openness\" (the \"modern idol\") rather than the \"jagged, asymmetrical\" nature of reality.P. 1218. In reference to Knitter's contribution as co-author in Paul Knitter and Roger Haight, [S.J.], Jesus and Buddha: Friends in Conversation (Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 2015), [Rev.] Joseph A. Bracken, S.J., in Catholic Books Review (2016), asserts, countering both Knitter and Haight, that \"in ethical reflection one should begin with the recognition of the Otherness of the Other\" rather than with \"the sustained meditation by the self on one's moral responsibility for others\": see review here In reference to Knitter's contribution as co-author of Jesus and Buddha: Friends in Conversation, Robert Magliola, in his review-article in Dilatato Corde,Vol. VI, No. 2 (July-Dec., 2016). online journal of the Dialogue Interreligieux Monastique / Monastic Interreligious Dialogue (www.dimmid.org), argues against Knitter's \"double-belonging\" (to both Mahayana and Christianity) in the following way: > Mahayana Buddhism affirms the Two truths doctrine, mundane truth and > Ultimate truth, are mystically identical, i.e., \"form is emptiness and > emptiness is form.\" Catholic Christianity, for its part has teachings such > as . . . the presence of God in all things via \"essence, presence, and > power,\" but matter and form are never regarded as absolutely identical. > Thus, in regard to the Ultimate, Mahayanist affirmation of the absolute > identity (via the Dharmak\u0101ya) and Catholic rejection of the absolute > identity (at any level or degree) are two tenets that irreducibly contradict > each other.
