    "text": "The Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS) is real-time gross settlement payment system used for sterling transactions in the United Kingdom. CHAPS was originally established in London by the Bankers Clearing House in February 1984, transferring to the CHAPS and Town Clearing Company Limited in December 1985.https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly- bulletin/1987/recent-developments-in-uk-payment-clearing-systems This company also operated the 'town clearing', where cheques cleared the same day between the 'town' bank branches in central London.https://www.chequeandcredit.co.uk/information-hub/history- cheque/clearings-early-days Town clearing had been the forerunner of the CHAPS system, and was finally closed in 1995. With the closure of the town clearing, the operating company was renamed to CHAPS Clearing Company Limited (informally CHAPS Co). Responsibility for the CHAPS system transferred from it to the Bank of England in November 2017. On 20 August 2018, the first non-bank institution, ipagoo LLP, joined the CHAPS scheme. ==Description== A CHAPS transfer is initiated by the sender to move money to the recipient's account (at another banking institution), where the funds need to be available (cleared) the same working day. Unlike with a bank giro credit, no pre-printed slip specifying the details of the recipient is required. Unlike cheques, the transfer is performed in real time, removing the issue of float or the potential for payments to be purposely stopped by the sender or returned due to insufficient funds, even after they appear to have arrived in the destination account. CHAPS is used by twenty direct participants, including the Bank of England, and over 4,500 indirect participants (who process transactions via agency arrangements with direct participants). In its first year of operation, average daily transactions numbered 7,000, with a total annual value of \u00a35 billion. In 2004, twenty years later, average daily transactions numbered 130,000, with an annual value of \u00a3300 billion. In 2010 there were 32 million CHAPS transactions, totalling over \u00a361 trillion,CHAPS Facts and Figures , UKPA. Retrieved 24 October 2011. down from \u00a373 trillion in 2008. CHAPS used to offer euro fund transfers as a member of the EU-area settlement system TARGET, but this service closed on 16 May 2008. The total value of these in 2007 was \u00a357 trillion. As well as making transfers originated by banks themselves, CHAPS is frequently used by businesses for high-value payments to suppliers, by mortgage lenders issuing advances, and by solicitors and conveyancers on behalf of individuals buying houses. ==Costs and problems== CHAPS transfers are relatively expensive, with banks typically charging as much as \u00a335 for a transfer. The cost of fast transfers and the low speed of free transfers (such as BACS) was a subject of controversy in the UK, until immediate transactions became available from the Faster Payments service.Faster Payments , UK Payments Administration, 2010. Retrieved 24 October 2011. Problems can arise from delays, such as when an exceptional workload at a bank results in the money being cleared too late in a working day to complete related transactions, or inadequate instructions, when a bank is not given sufficient information to know where to credit the money, or a human delay in operating the machines. ==Participants== As of October 2019 the CHAPS participants are: * Bank of America London branch * Bank of China London branch * Bank of England * Bank of Scotland * Barclays * BNP Paribas London branch * Citibank London branch * ClearBank Limited * CLS Group International (an Edge Act Bank based in New York) * Clydesdale Bank * Danske Bank * Deutsche Bank London branch * Elavon Financial Services DAC UK branch * Euroclear Bank SA/NV Brussels Head Office * Handelsbanken plc (UK subsidiary of Svenska Handelsbanken AB) * HSBC Bank (Europe) (part of the HSBC Group) * ING Group Amsterdam Head Office * Ipagoo LLP * JPMorgan Chase London branch * LCH Limited * Lloyds Bank * National Westminster Bank * Northern Trust London branch * Royal Bank of Scotland * Santander UK * Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale (Paris Head Office) * Standard Chartered Bank * State Street Bank and Trust Company London branch * The Bank of New York Mellon London branch * The Co-operative Bank * TSB Bank plc * UBS London branch * Virgin Money CHAPS clearing information relating to UK banks may be found in the Industry Sorting Code Directory. ==See also== * CHIPS, the US equivalent of CHAPS ==External links== *https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/payment-and-settlement/chaps *CHAPS page on the Payments Council website *CHAPS LinkedIn Page ==References== Category:Financial services companies of the United Kingdom Category:Payment clearing systems Category:1984 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Banking in the United Kingdom ",
