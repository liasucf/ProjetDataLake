He netted his first goal in December 2010 during a Georgian Cup victory over Tskhinvali. In total, Kasradze remained for five campaigns and made one hundred and twenty-four appearances in all competitions; scoring seven times. AZAL of the Azerbaijan Premier League completed the signing of Kasradze in 2014. He would score twice, versus Sumgayit and Neftchala, in forty-nine appearances over two seasons. 2015 saw Kasradze join fellow Azerbaijan club Inter Baku. Twenty appearances followed in 2015\u201316 as Inter Baku finished fourth. Kasradze made a return to Georgian football in June 2016 by agreeing to join Sioni Bolnisi. A year later, Samtredia became Kasradze's fifth club. He featured thirty-six times and netted once in his sole season with them. In 2018, Kasradze joined Kazakhstan Premier League side Zhetysu. He made his professional debut on 11 March during a loss to Tobol. Kasradze left Zhetysu at the end of 2018, subsequently moving across the country to newly-promoted top-flight team Taraz. He returned to Georgia after eighteen matches, signing with Torpedo Kutaisi in early 2020. Kasradze's first and last match for Torpedo Kutaisi came against Dila Gori, with the latter winning both matches. He terminated his contract in September 2020. However, in October, the defender rejoined Torpedo Kutaisi on a contract until the succeeding December. Kasradze scored on his first appearance back with the club, netting a stoppage time winner versus Merani Tbilisi on 17 October. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Club statistics |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"6\"|WIT Georgia |2009\u201310 |rowspan=\"5\"|Umaglesi Liga |1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||1||0 |- |2010\u201311 |32||0||4||1||1Appearance(s) in the UEFA Europa League||0||1Appearance(s) in the Georgian Super Cup||0||38||1 |- |2011\u201312 |18||2||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||13Appearance(s) in the Umaglesi Liga play- offs||2||35||4 |- |2012\u201313 |27||0||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||31||0 |- |2013\u201314 |18||2||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||19||2 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !96!!4!!13!!1!!1!!0!!14!!2!!124!!7 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|AZAL |2013\u201314 |rowspan=\"2\"|Azerbaijan Premier League |13||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||13||1 |- |2014\u201315 |33||0||3||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||36||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !46!!1!!3!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!49!!2 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Inter Baku |2015\u201316 |rowspan=\"1\"|Azerbaijan Premier League |20||0||3||1||6||0||0||0||29||1 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Sioni Bolnisi |2016 |rowspan=\"2\"|Erovnuli Liga |12||0||2||0||0||0||2||0||16||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Samtredia |2017 |33||1||2||0||2Appearance(s) in the UEFA Champions League||0||1||0||38||1 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Zhetysu |2018 |rowspan=\"2\"|Kazakhstan Premier League |21||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||21||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Taraz |2019 |17||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||18||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Torpedo Kutaisi |2020 |rowspan=\"1\"|Erovnuli Liga |10||1||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||11||1 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !255!!7!!25!!1!!9!!0!!17!!2!!306!!10 |} ==Honours== ;Samtredia *Georgian Super Cup: 2017 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Tbilisi Category:Footballers from Georgia (country) Category:FC WIT Georgia players Category:AZAL PFK players Category:Ke\u015fla FK players Category:FC Sioni Bolnisi players Category:FC Samtredia players Category:FC Zhetysu players Category:FC Taraz players Category:FC Torpedo Kutaisi players Category:Erovnuli Liga players Category:Azerbaijan Premier League players Category:Kazakhstan Premier League players Category:Expatriate footballers from Georgia (country) Category:Expatriate footballers in Azerbaijan Category:Expatriate footballers in Kazakhstan Category:Expatriate sportspeople from Georgia (country) in Azerbaijan Category:Expatriate sportspeople from Georgia (country) in Kazakhstan Category:Association football defenders ",
