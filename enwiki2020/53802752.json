In 2012 he was elevated to the grade of Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for contributions to stochastic and randomized methods in systems and control. In 2008, he was bestowed the George S. Axelby Award. He holds a permanent appointment with the University of Brescia, Italy, while also collaborating with various research institutions, universities and the NASA. == References == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Italian mathematicians Category:Italian engineers ==External links== Interview with Marco C.
