    "text": "Podopteryx selysi is a species of Australian damselfly in the family Megapodagrionidae, commonly known as a treehole flatwing. It can be found in coastal northern Australia and New Guinea, where its larvae live in water- filled holes in tree trunks in rainforest. Podopteryx selysi is a very large damselfly, black-metallic in colour with white to pink markings on its head and body. Like other members of the family Megapodagrionidae, it rests with its wings outspread. Unusually, and possibly uniquely for a damselfly, the hindwings of Podopteryx selysi are longer than its forewings. For other damselflies, forewings are usually marginally longer than hindwings. ==Gallery== Podopteryx selysi female (11776054354).jpg | Tip of female tail. Note the egg still in her ovipositor.
