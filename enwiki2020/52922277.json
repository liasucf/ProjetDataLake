    "text": "Mucha's cover page from 1871 Mucha was a Polish satirical magazine published in Warsaw in the periods 1868-1939 and 1946\u20131952. In 1953 it was merged into another satirical one, Szpilki.\"Prasa satyryczna i humorystyczna w XIX i XX wieku\" (Retrieved 18 January 2017)\"\u201eMucha\u201d, czyli polskie \u201eCharlie Hebdo\u201d okresu przedwojennego\" (Retrieved 18 January 2017) The magazine was founded and edited by bookseller J\u00f3zef Kaufman, followed by other owners. It included caricatures, jokes and humorous verses and short stories. Among its many writers, editors, and illustrators were Franciszek Kostrzewski and Boles\u0142aw Prus, however the vast majority of contributions were anonymous. The pre-1939 version was known of its right-wing, nationalistic, xenophobic topics. The level of the humor was rather low; examples: :- Doctor, please help, my wife ate too much during the holiday and now it hurts her! :- Indeed? :- No, in the belly! :- :- Mr. advocate, sir, did you have happy holidays? :- They were happy for me, indeed: three cases of battery, two of insult, and three dozens of rejected promissory notes! :- :- Horror! Yesterday a young girl jumped from a bridge! :- Did she fall in love badly? :- No, in Vistula. While mucha means \"fly\" in Polish, actually the magazine was named after a daredevil acrobat Antoni Mucha, whose caricatures were prominent in the first issues.
