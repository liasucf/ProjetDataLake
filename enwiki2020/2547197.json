Loudonville was a census-designated place in the 1970, 1980, and 1990 US Census, but ceased to be in the 2000 Census, but became a CDP again in 2020. ==History== The hamlet is named after John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun and was originally a 19th-century summer resort for some of Albany's wealthiest residents. Loudon Road, known as Old Plank Road in the early 19th century, is lined with several historic Jeffersonian mansions. See also: Loudonville started as a hamlet on Loudon Road (originally a plank road), at the intersection of Crumitie Road. Ireland's Corners was a separate hamlet to the north at the intersection of Loudon Road and Menand/Osborne Road, with a post office. Ireland's Corners is named for Elias H. Ireland who in 1832 bought the heavily wooded area from the Patroon, Stephen Van Rensselaer. In 1871 the post office at Ireland's Corners was renamed Loudonville. ==Geography== The community is located directly north of Albany, New York and south of Newtonville. The hamlet is centered on the original Ireland's Corners, the intersection of U.S. Route 9 with Osborne Road (County Route 154)/Menand Road (NY Route 378) (west bound name/east bound names respectively), with the northwest corner bisected by Old Niskayuna Road (County Route 152).
