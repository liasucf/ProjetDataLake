    "text": "Dan Sperber (born 20 June 1942 in Cagnes-sur-Mer) is a French social and cognitive scientist. His most influential work has been in the fields of cognitive anthropology and linguistic pragmatics: developing, with British psychologist Deirdre Wilson, relevance theory in the latter; and an approach to cultural evolution known as the epidemiology of representations in the former. Sperber currently holds the positions of Directeur de Recherche \u00e9m\u00e9rite at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and Director of the International Cognition and Culture Institute. ==Background== Sperber is the son of Austrian-French novelist Man\u00e8s Sperber. He was born in France and raised an atheist but his parents, both non-religious Ashkenazi Jews, imparted to the young Sperber a \"respect for my Rabbinic ancestors and for religious thinkers of any persuasion more generally\". He became interested in anthropology as a means of explaining how rational people come to hold mistaken religious beliefs about the supernatural. ==Career== Sperber was trained in anthropology at the Sorbonne and the University of Oxford. In 1965 he joined the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) as a researcher, initially in the Laboratoire d'\u00c9tudes Africaines (African studies laboratory). Later he moved to the Laboratoire d'ethnologie et de sociologie comparative (Ethnology and Comparative Sociology), the Centre de Recherche en Epist\u00e9mologie Appliqu\u00e9e and finally, from 2001, the Institut Jean Nicod. Sperber's early work was on the anthropology of religion, and he conducted ethnographic fieldwork among the Dorze people of Ethiopia. Sperber was an early proponent of structural anthropology, having been introduced to it by Rodney Needham at Oxford, and helped popularise it in British social anthropology. At the CNRS he studied under Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, credited as the founder of structuralism, who encouraged Sperber's \"untypical theoretical musings\". In the 1970s, however, Sperber came to be identified with post- structuralism in French anthropology, and criticised the theories of L\u00e9vi- Strauss and other structuralists for using interpretive ethnographic data as if it were an objective record, and for its lack of explanatory power. Nevertheless, Sperber has persistently defended the legacy of L\u00e9vi-Strauss' work as opening the door for naturalistic social science, and as an important precursor to cognitive anthropology. After moving away from structuralism, Sperber sought an alternative naturalistic approach to the study of culture. His 1975 book Rethinking Symbolism, outlined a theory of symbolism using concepts from the burgeoning field of cognitive psychology. It was formulated as a reply to semiological theories which were becoming widespread in anthropology through the works of Victor Turner and Clifford Geertz (which formed the basis of what come to be known as symbolic anthropology). Sperber's later work has continued to argue for the importance of cognitive processes understood through psychology in understanding cultural phenomena and, in particular, cultural transmission. His 'epidemiology of representations' is an approach to cultural evolution inspired by the field of epidemiology. It proposes that the distribution of cultural representations (ideas about the world held by multiple individuals) within a population should be explained with reference to biases in transmission (illuminated by cognitive and evolutionary psychology) and the \"ecology\" of the individual minds they inhabit. Sperber's approach is broadly Darwinist\u2014it explains the macro- distribution of a trait in a population in terms of the cumulative effect micro-processes acting over time\u2014but departs from memetics because he does not see representations as replicators except for in a few special circumstances (such as chain letters). The cognitive and epidemiological approach to cultural evolution has been influential, but as a means of explaining culture more generally it is pursued by only a small minority of scholars. His latest work, published with cognitive scientist Hugo Mercier, has developed their argumentative theory of reason. His most influential work is arguably in linguistics and philosophy: with the British linguist and philosopher Deirdre Wilson he has developed an innovative approach to linguistic interpretation known as relevance theory which has become mainstream in the area of pragmatics, linguistics, artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology. He argues that cognitive processes are geared toward the maximisation of relevance, that is, a search for an optimal balance between cognitive efforts and cognitive effects. As well as his emeritus position at the CNRS, Sperber is currently part time professor in the departments of Cognitive Science and of Philosophy at the Central European University in Budapest. He is also the Director of the International Cognition and Culture Institute, a scientific discussion and research website. He is a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy and in 2009 was awarded the inaugural Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss Prize for excellence of French research in the humanities and social sciences. In 2011 he gave a Turku Agora Lecture.http://aboagora.wordpress.com/2011/11/14/agora- lecture-%E2%80%93-dan-sperber-culture-and-minds/ ==Bibliography== * Le structuralisme en anthropologie (\u00c9ditions du Seuil, 1973) * Rethinking Symbolism (Cambridge University Press, 1975) * On Anthropological Knowledge (Cambridge University Press, 1985) * (with Deirdre Wilson) Relevance.
