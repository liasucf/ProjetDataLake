It is located along the Ofotbanen railway line, between Katterat Station and Bj\u00f8rnfjell Station. It has direct railway connections to Narvik, Kiruna, and Lule\u00e5. The station is primarily used by people who have cabins in the area, and is located at an altitude of above mean sea level. The station was originally opened in 1955, but it was moved in 1988 when a new route was built to circumvent the old and outdated Norddal Bridge that had been built in 1902. ==References== Category:Narvik Category:Railway stations on the Ofoten Line Category:Railway stations in Narvik Category:Railway stations opened in 1902 Category:1902 establishments in Norway ",
