    "text": "Dario \u0160imi\u0107 (; born 12 November 1975) is a Croatian former footballer. \u0160imi\u0107 was a versatile defender who played as full-back, sweeper or centre back; a physical and hard-tackling defender, he was known in particular for his strength and ability in the air. A product of Dinamo Zagreb Academy, he later played for Serie A sides Inter Milan and A.C. Milan and Ligue 1 side Monaco, before returning to Dinamo Zagreb in 2010, where he retired from the game during the same year. \u0160imi\u0107 also played for Croatia national football team and is the team's eighthmost capped player, having won a total of 100 international caps between 1996 and 2008. He was member of Croatia's squad in all six major tournaments they qualified for during the 1990s and 2000s, which includes three FIFA World Cups (11 appearances in 1998, 2002 and 2006) and three UEFA European Championships (5 appearances in 1996, 2004 and 2008). ==Club career== ===Dinamo Zagreb=== \u0160imi\u0107 joined Dinamo Zagreb in 1987 at the age of twelve and rose through the ranks of their youth academy before being promoted to the senior squad for the 1992\u201393 season. His debut for the Blues came under manager Miroslav Bla\u017eevi\u0107 in the first match of the season, a Prva HNL away game against Varteks on 23 August 1992, which made him the youngest ever player to debut for the club as \u0160imi\u0107 was only three months shy from his 17th birthday. He continued to make five more appearances in his first top- flight season and although was widely regarded as a promising player, he struggled to make a bigger impact in his first season with the squad which eventually won the Croatian title that year. However, right from the beginning of the 1993\u201394 season he established himself as a first team regular and was one of the key players of the squad in one of the most successful periods in club's history. In the next six seasons \u0160imi\u0107 helped the club win another four titles as well as four Croatian Cups. In this period \u0160imi\u0107 also experienced his first taste of European football when Dinamo (known as Croatia Zagreb from 1992 to 2000) played Auxerre in a 1994\u201395 Cup Winners' Cup first round tie as he appeared a 3\u20131 home win at Maksimir on 29 September 1994. He regularly appeared in all of the club's European campaigns over the following four seasons and took part in some of the club's biggest achievements in recent times, such as reaching the 1997\u201398 UEFA Cup round of 16 (where they were knocked out by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 2\u20131 on aggregate) and group stage of the 1998\u201399 Champions League (after knocking out Celtic 3\u20131 on aggregate in the second qualifying round). Other notable Dinamo players and \u0160imi\u0107's teammates from that era were Silvio Mari\u0107, Dra\u017een Ladi\u0107, Igor Cvitanovi\u0107, Mark Viduka and Robert Prosine\u010dki, as well as Krunoslav Jur\u010di\u0107 and Goran Juri\u0107 with whom he formed a solid defensive partnership. In his six and a half years with the club, \u0160imi\u0107 earned a total of 140 league appearances and scored 14 goals. In the meantime \u0160imi\u0107's former coach at Dinamo, Miroslav Bla\u017eevi\u0107, was appointed Croatia manager in 1994. In 1996, impressed by his string of good performances, Bla\u017eevi\u0107 called him up and, after playing 16 games for Croatia's youth teams, \u0160imi\u0107 earned his first full international cap on 13 March 1996 in a friendly against South Korea, coming on as a substitute for Igor \u0160timac. \u0160imi\u0107 quickly became a first team regular in the national team under Bla\u017eevi\u0107, and went on to play in six 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, as well as six matches at the final tournament itself in France, where Croatia eventually won third place. ===Internazionale=== His good performances at the 1998 World Cup and in the 1998\u201399 Champions League attracted attention from some of Europe's biggest clubs and he went on to join Internazionale in January 1999 for a fee of 11 million euros, which was at the time Dinamo's all-time transfer record (and to this day surpassed only by outgoing transfers of Vedran \u0106orluka and Eduardo in 2007 and Luka Modri\u0107 in 2008). Under coach Marcello Lippi, \u0160imi\u0107 had his Serie A debut in a 2\u20130 win against Venezia at San Siro on 10 January 1999. By the end of his first season in Italy, \u0160imi\u0107 earned a total of 17 appearances and scored 2 goals for Internazionale. In the following couple of seasons \u0160imi\u0107's services were regularly used, until the 2001\u201302 season, when he had only 12 league and 8 European appearances. and in June 2002 Internazionale and their cross-city rivals AC Milan agreed a player swap with \u00dcmit Davala going in the opposite direction, which \u0160imi\u0107 was valued \u20ac16.5 million, despite it was purely accounting purpose.FC Internazionale Milano SpA Report and Accounts on 30 June 2002 , CCIAA In his three and a half years with Internazionale he earned a total of 66 league appearances and scored 3 goals. The club failed to win any silverware in this period, and their highest finish was fourth place in the 1999\u20132000 season, even though this was the time when some of football's biggest stars played there with \u0160imi\u0107, such as Roberto Baggio, Ronaldo, Ivan Zamorano, Diego Simeone and Christian Vieri. ===Milan=== At A.C. Milan, \u0160imi\u0107 was immediately made a member of the first-team squad under Carlo Ancelotti, who changed \u0160imi\u0107's playing position from centre back to right back in a four-men defensive line. His debut for AC Milan came in a 2002\u201303 Champions League third qualifying round away game against Slovan Liberec on 28 August 2002. \u0160imi\u0107 went on to make 12 appearances for AC Milan in their run to the UEFA Champions League title in 2003, though he was omitted from both semi-final legs against Inter and the final match against Serie A rivals Juventus at Old Trafford. He made 29 Serie A appearances for AC Milan in his first season with the club, but in the following three seasons he never regained his place as a first-team regular, making only 27 league appearances over the three seasons. In May 2006, he signed a contract extension until 2009 with AC Milan, just weeks after openly criticising coach Carlo Ancelotti over lack of playing time. He was more or less able to regain his place as a regular with AC Milan in the Serie A in 2006\u201307, making 22 league appearances that season. However, his opportunities in the UEFA Champions League, won again by AC Milan that season, were limited as he only made six appearances (including two in the qualifying rounds) until the round of 16. The 2007\u201308 season saw him making only four Serie A appearances for the club. In his only UEFA Champions League appearance that season, against Celtic, he was member of the starting eleven but was forced to leave the pitch due to an injury after spending less than 30 minutes in the game. ===Monaco=== In August 2008, \u0160imi\u0107 moved to AS Monaco. He made his Ligue 1 debut on 23 August 2008 in Monaco's 1\u20131 draw at home to SM Caen, playing the entire match and assisting Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Nimani for the opening goal. He went on to establish himself as a regular at the club, making a total of 26 league appearances before being sent off against Le Havre in April 2009. He lost his place as a regular in the team after that, making no appearances since Monaco's final league match of the 2008\u201309 season, a goalless draw at Paris Saint-Germain. ===Dinamo Zagreb=== On 27 April 2010, \u0160imi\u0107 returned to Dinamo Zagreb on a free transfer after having spent 11 years playing abroad. However, \u0160imi\u0107 went on to announce his retirement from active football only three months later on 10 August 2010. During the short spell \u0160imi\u0107 appeared in 3 competitive matches for the Blues, including the 2010 Croatian Supercup, and two European away matches against Koper and Sheriff Tiraspol, without ever appearing in the 2010\u201311 Prva HNL. In his announcement, \u0160imi\u0107 said that he enrolled at the coaching academy and confirmed that his future plans involved staying in football, possibly as a manager. ==International career== Between 1993 and 1996, \u0160imi\u0107 won a total of 17 international caps for the Croatian under-19 and under-21 national teams, scoring one goal for the under-21 team. He made his senior international debut on 13 March 1996 in a friendly match against the Korea Republic, coming on as a substitute for Igor \u0160timac in the final 20 minutes. \u0160imi\u0107 only made one appearance for Croatia at the UEFA Euro 1996 finals in England. However, he established himself as a regular at the 1998 FIFA World Cup finals in France, where he appeared in six of Croatia's seven matches in their run to a third- place finish, only missing the third-place match with a yellow-card suspension. He made two appearances for Croatia at the 2002 FIFA World Cup finals and also featured in all of their three group matches at the UEFA Euro 2004 finals. Both these tournaments saw Croatia being eliminated in the group stage, just like the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals, where he appeared in all of Croatia's three matches. Winning his 82nd international cap in the team's second match at the latter tournament, against Japan on 18 June 2006 in Nuremberg, he dislodged Robert Jarni (81 caps) as the Croatian national team's all-time cap leader. In the final group match, a 2\u20132 draw against Australia, he was sent off five minutes from time after receiving his second yellow card. \u0160imi\u0107 also scored three goals for Croatia, with his final international goal coming in a friendly match against Argentina on 1 March 2006 in Basel, where he netted a last-minute goal to give Croatia a 3\u20132 victory. Alongside experienced Robert Kova\u010d and Igor Tudor, he is considered one of the best Croatian defenders in recent history. ===100th cap and retirement=== \u0160imi\u0107 came very close to completing the fairy tale and winning his 100th cap for Croatia at the finals of the UEFA Euro 2008. However, he missed the first two games of the tournament, unable to dislodge Vedran \u0106orluka, Robert Kova\u010d or Josip \u0160imuni\u0107 from their berths in the first team. With a place in the quarter-finals secured after the first two games, Croatia coach Slaven Bili\u0107 gave many of his second-string players a chance to play in the final group match against Poland, with \u0160imi\u0107 starting the match and captaining the side on the occasion of his 99th cap. Croatia went on to win the match 1\u20130, finishing the group stage with 3 wins in 3 matches. However, he was once again left an unused substitute in the quarter-finals against Turkey, which Croatia lost in penalty shootout. On 20 August 2008, \u0160imi\u0107 finally won his 100th international cap in a friendly match against Slovenia in Maribor, becoming the first Croatian player to win 100 international caps. He started the match and captained the team in the first half, before being replaced by debutant Ivica Kri\u017eanac at half-time. Croatia won the match 3\u20132. \u0160imi\u0107 was subsequently also called up for Croatia's opening two qualifiers for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in early September 2008, at home to Kazakhstan and England, being an unused substitute in the former and completely left out of the latter. Following the 4\u20131 defeat to England, Croatia's first competitive defeat at home, rumours about \u0160imi\u0107 being set to retire from international football appeared in the Croatian media. On 16 September 2008, it was eventually confirmed that \u0160imi\u0107 has announced his retirement from international football after being a Croatian international for 12 and a half years. ==Personal life== \u0160imi\u0107 is a devout Catholic and organizes pilgrimages. He is the owner of Aquaviva company. He married Jelena \u0160imi\u0107 in 2000 with whom he has sons Roko, Viktor, Nikolas and David, the latter of whom suffers from Down syndrome. He is the older brother of Josip \u0160imi\u0107. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! colspan=3 | Club performance ! colspan=2 | League ! colspan=2 | Cup1 ! colspan=2 | League Cup ! colspan=2 | Continental ! colspan=2 | Total |- !
