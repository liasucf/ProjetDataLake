    "text": "Ang Em (also spelled Ang Im;; 1794-1843) was a Cambodian prince. He was the fourth son of King Ang Eng. The Siamese king Rama I died in 1809. King Ang Chan II refused to attend his royal cremation. Instead, Ang Chan sent three Cambodian princes, including Ang Snguon, Ang Em and Ang Duong, to attend the funeral. Ang Em was appointed Cambodian Upraracha by Rama II. The Uprayorach Ang Snguon ousted Ang Chan in 1811. After Vietnamese intervention, Ang Snguon, Ang Em and Ang Duong fled to Bangkok. After the L\u00ea V\u0103n Kh\u00f4i revolt broke out in Cochinchina, Chaophraya Bodindecha (Sing Sinhaseni) invaded Cambodia, aiming to put Ang Em on the throne. However, they were not supported by Cambodian. Siamese army had to withdraw from Cambodia in 1834. Ang Em was appointed the governor of Battambang in 1834 by Siamese. Siamese army occupied northwest provinces (Battambang, Siem Reap, Pursat and Kampong Svai), northwest provinces were rulered de jure by two Cambodian princes, Ang Em and Ang Duong. The Siamese hoped that the princes would be able to draw loyalty and support from Khmer nobles. Two princes were regarded as the most dangerous men by Vietnamese court; Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Minh Gi\u1ea3ng, the Vietnamese Governor-General of Tr\u1ea5n T\u00e2y, tried to persuade them to go back to Cambodia. Actually it was a conspiracy designed by Gi\u1ea3ng. In 1837, Duong was suspected of having links with Vietnamese, and deported to Bangkok. Two years later, Em and his followers secretly fled back to Cambodia, Em was under the illusion that he would be installed the new king, however, they were arrested by Vietnamese. Gi\u1ea3ng suggested that they should be executed, but Minh M\u1ea1ng rejected.\u0110\u1ea1i Nam ch\u00ednh bi\u00ean li\u1ec7t truy\u1ec7n s\u01a1 t\u1eadp, vol. 31 Ang Em was deported Saigon then to Hu\u1ebf. Cambodia was annexed by Vietnam in 1840. Spurred by Queen Ang Mey's deposition, many Cambodian courtiers and their followers revolted against the Vietnamese rule. Siamese army entered Cambodia to install Ang Duong on the throne. Ang Em was released together with Ang Mey. In the next year, Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Minh Gi\u1ea3ng tried to put him on the throne as Vietnamese puppet king. Em and Mey came to Cambodia, they ordered Khmer rebels to surrender, but no one obeyed.
