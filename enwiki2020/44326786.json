    "text": "Cursed is the sixth album by English rock band The Scaramanga Six. == Background == The songs for Cursed were originally intended for what would have been the fifth Scaramanga Six album, A Pound of Flesh. This album was scheduled for recording in 2006 with producer Tim Smith, who'd produced the band's third and fourth albums. Versions of tracks were recorded and a single, \"Walking Through Houses\", released before Smith was felled by a disastrous combined heart attack and stroke, leaving him unable to continue. Having become close friends with Smith, the band felt unable to replace him and complete the album sessions, later admitting \"we simply couldn't go back to these recordings without him and recoiled to contemplate what to do next.\"\u201cThe hideous transformation of the new album\u201d \u2013 post on Scaramanga Six blog by Steven Morricone, November 22, 2010 The initial solution was for The Scaramanga Six to write and record a new album of new songs, which duly became 2009's Songs of Prey album. (\"We wanted to pay tribute to the man who had inspired us and felt that to carry on with as much bombast as possible was the best way.\") The band hoped to wait and resurrect the uncompleted Pound of Flesh work once Smith had recovered. However, when the devastating long-term effects of Smith's condition ensured that it was unlikely that this plan could be carried out, Steven and Paul Morricone opted to revisit the Pound of Flesh songs in 2010, finding a way of making use of the existing songwriting while honouring the memory of Smith and the original sessions. In 2011, Steven recalled the process as follows: \"As we started bashing out new songs we knew that something wasn\u2019t quite right \u2013 there was a feeling of unresolve. We had 'a lost album' and it suddenly hit us all. Could we simply ignore the wealth of music and love we had created with Sir Tim? No\u2026 It felt strange at first. These were songs we had heard over and over a few years before and we were playing them all again. But instead of a turgid process of replication we found ourselves reigniting the flame we had then adding more and more to it.\" The Morricones reworked and rewrote the songs as new versions, then recorded them in new sessions at 2fly Studios in Sheffield produced by Alan Smyth (Pulp, Arctic Monkeys, Richard Hawley and others). Cursed was also the most expansively-arranged Scaramanga Six album for many years, with the Morricone brothers\u2019 saxophones bolstered by trumpet and trombone (recorded at the original Smith sessions), live strings, and additional keyboards played by former member Chris Catalyst. New York singer-songwriter and instrument inventor Thomas Truax also made a guest appearance, playing three of his own instruments \u2013 the Hornicator, the String-a-Ling and the mysterious Dracula's Eyeball. Apart from the brass tracks, the only recording retained from the Smith sessions was \"Walking Through Houses\" which the Morricones decided \"had to stay as it was\". ==Reception== Like its predecessors, the album received some very positive reviews. Notably, it was the first Scaramanga Six album to be covered in the national mass media. In The Sun, Matt Silk gave the album 4.5 out of 5, writing \"this, the sixth album from the Leeds-based outfit, was meant to be their fifth. But Cardiacs genius Tim Smith was in the middle of producing it when he suffered a stroke in 2008. Here the material resurfaces and serves as a fitting tribute to Tim, packed with all the drama and inventiveness you would associate with his work. Part art-rock, part punk, part pop, TSS\u2019s haunting songs always ooze eclectic theatrical class. But Cursed takes it up a notch \u2013 bordering on epic at times. It's their best album yet and that\u2019s saying something.\"Review of Cursed in The Sun by Matt Silk, May 2011 Manchester Music dubbed Cursed \"a worthy contender for anyone\u2019s album of the year\", commenting \"whilst it\u2019s missing the important infusion of Smith\u2019s dark art, the band have enough of their own musical black magic, as has Smyth... Just feel the writhing, scratching intro and satisfying bass growl of \"Damned If You Don\u2019t, Damned If You Do\" \u2013 like all the tracks here the skilled pop infusions and progressive nuances complete a perfect recipe... Their long standing punk sensibility hasn't been lost on them either with \"Trouble\" (and later on in the proceedings via the catchy and impossibly addictive \"The Repo Man\"). This all makes a valiant effort to blow up your speakers \u2013 let's not forget their sense of the theatrical on an instrumental that is aptly titled \"Dark Matter\".\"Review of Cursed in Manchester Music by Jon Ashley, April 30, 2011 ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ===The Scaramanga Six=== *Paul Morricone \u2013 vocals, electric & acoustic guitars, baritone saxophone, Suzuki Q-chord, Wasp synthesizer, glockenspiel *Steven Morricone \u2013 vocals, bass guitar, piano, electric piano, organ, harpsichord, tenor saxophone, dulcimer, xylophone, flexatone *Julia Arnez\u2013 guitars, vocals *Gareth Champion \u2013 drums ===Guest musicians=== *Chris Catalyst \u2013 piano, electric piano, second drumkit *Thomas Truax \u2013 Hornicator, String-a-Ling, Dracula\u2019s Eyeball *Leslie Turner \u2013 violin *Lins Wilson \u2013 cello *Pat \"Herb\" Fulgoni \u2013 trumpet *Rob Paul Chapman \u2013 trombone *\"Some crows\" \u2013 cawing == References == Category:2011 albums Category:The Scaramanga Six albums ",
