    "text": "The 1970 Buffalo Bills season was the franchise's 1st season in the National Football League, and the 11th overall. The team looked to improve on its 4\u201310 record from 1969 and make the playoffs for the first time since 1966. However, the Bills started out on the wrong foot, losing 4 of its first 5 games. After winning 2 straight road games against the Patriots and Jets and suffering a blowout loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, the Bills and Colts played to a 17-17 draw in week 9, Buffalo's first tie since 1968. The Bills would then lose 5 straight to end the season and finish the season 3-10-1, in fourth place in the AFC East. Their week 5 game against the Miami Dolphins would start a stage of futility in which the Bills would lose 20 straight games to the Dolphins. The Bills would not beat the Dolphins at any point during the 70s and would not beat Miami again until 1980. This would become known as \"The Streak\". ==Offseason== ===NFL Draft=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" ! style=\"background:#C41E3A;color:#14345B;\" width=\"7%\"| Round ! style=\"background:#C41E3A;color:#14345B;\" width=\"7%\"| Pick ! style=\"background:#C41E3A;color:#14345B;\" width=\"20%\"| Player ! style=\"background:#C41E3A;color:#14345B;\" width=\"15%\"| Position ! style=\"background:#C41E3A;color:#14345B;\" width=\"20%\"| School/Club Team |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |1||5||Al Cowlings||Defensive End|| USC |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |2||30||Dennis Shaw||Quarterback|| San Diego State |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |3||57||Jim Reilly||Guard|| Notre Dame |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |3||67||Glenn Alexander||Defensive back||Grambling |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |4||82||Jerome Gantt||Defensive end||North Carolina Central |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |5||109||Steve Starnes||Linebacker||Tampa |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |6||134||Ken Edwards||Running back|| Virginia Tech |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |6||135||Grant Guthrie||Kicker||Florida State |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |7||161||Wayne Fowler||Tackle||Richmond |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |8||186||Richard Cheek||Tackle||Auburn |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |9||213||Bill Bridges||Guard||Houston |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |10||238||Willie Dixon||Defensive back||Albany State |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |11||265||Terry Williams||Running back||Grambling |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |12||290||Dave Simpson||Tackle||Drake |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |13||317||Steve Schroeder||Kicker||Pacific |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |14||342||William Costen||Tackle||Morris Brown |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |15||369||Dave Farris||Tight end||Central Michigan |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |16||394||Larry Davis||Wide receiver||Rice |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |17||421||George Bevan||Defensive back||Louisiana State |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |}https://www.pro-football- reference.com/draft/1970.htm ==Personnel== ===Coaches/Staff=== {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align: left;border:2px solid black;\" |- ! colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center;background-color: #004089;color:white;border:2px solid red;\" | 1970 Buffalo Bills staff |- |colspan=7 align=\"right\" | |- |valign=\"top\"| | style=\"font-size: 95%;\" valign=\"top\" | Front office *President \u2013 Ralph Wilson *Vice President and General Manager \u2013 Bob Lustig *Vice President/Minority Owner \u2013 Pat McGroder Coaching staff *Head Coach - John Rauch Offensive coaches *Offensive Line \u2013 Marvin Bass & Chuck Gottfried Defensive coaches' *Defensive Line \u2013 Ray Malavsi *Linebackers \u2013 Ralph Hawkins *Defensive Backfield \u2013 Bobby Hunt *Kickers - Bugsy Engelberg |} *Source: https://pro-football- history.com/franchise/7/buffalo-bills-coaches ===Final roster=== ==Regular season== ===Schedule=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
