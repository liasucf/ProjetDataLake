    "text": "Two is the second album by the reunited duo Miss Kittin & The Hacker released in 2009 by Miss Kittin's label Nobody's Bizzness. ==Background and development== In 2007, Miss Kittin & The Hacker reunited to release the single \"Hometown / Dimanche\" through Good Life Recordings. The music video for \"Hometown\" was directed by R\u00e9gis Brochier of 7th floor Productions. Miss Kittin & The Hacker reunited for a European tour in 2008, but they also toured throughout America and around the world, before they both started recording new songs, some of which were performed whilst touring. Several of the songs that they composed while on tour were included on the album Two. ==Promotion== Miss Kittin & The Hacker toured as part of the festival Get Loaded In The Park in August 2009. Miss Kittin & The Hacker filmed a promotional music video for their cover of \"Suspicious Minds\", which was directed by R\u00e9gis Brochier of 7th floor Productions. \"Suspicious Minds\" was later featured on the downloadable for free mixtape Skull of Dreams by Little Boots. ===Singles=== *\"PPPO\" was released as the album's first single on 13 March 2009. *\"1000 Dreams\" was released as the album's second single on 3 April 2009. The song became a minor hit in Belgium, where it reached top-twenty on the Flanders Ultratip chart. The music video was directed by R\u00e9gis Brochier of 7th floor Productions in January 2009. *\"Party in My Head\" was released as the third and final single on 19 June 2009. XLR8R offered a free download of the Thieves Like Us remix of the single on its website. ==Critical reception== Two received generally favorable reviews. The album holds a score of 62 out of 100 on the review aggregator website Metacritic. David Abravanel from PopMatters opined that \"Two is as nakedly honest and lush an album as either party involved has made. [...] the record is a fantastic progression for Miss Kittin & The Hacker, managing to preserve what made them great partners in the first place, while gracefully maturing into something more multifaceted and emotionally open. Tom Naylor, writing for NME, commented that the album \"finds them little changed. The Hacker is still a dab hand at dark electro, his rich, chewy tracks bubbling like molasses in a cauldron; Miss Kittin still veers close to self- parody (see 'Ray Ban') and they still sound best \u2013 'Party In My Head', 'Emotional Interlude', a delicious, Europop cover of 'Suspicious Minds' \u2013 when they allow light, and vulnerability, to penetrate the gloom.\" URB remarked that \"It seems as though they\u2019re as strong as ever. Is the production skeletal? You could say that. There isn\u2019t really a reason why that should be an issue though. Less is often more: any electro-head should know this to be true.\" Resident Advisor's St\u00e9phane Girard opined, \"In the end, Two isn't a massive step forward, but it isn't a step backward either. 'Suspicious Minds' aside, though, there is an air of self-confidence emanating from the songs collected on here that wasn't present eight years ago.\" In a review for XLR8R, Rob Geary stated, \"Despite the ridiculously blank 'Ray Ban,' enough of Two excites by delving deeper into the subconscious (the crashing, Nord-led aggression of 'Indulgence') or stepping out into the sunlight (a goofy, cheerful cover of 'Suspicious Minds') to justify marking a calendar eight years from now for a Three.\" Angela Shawn-Chi Lu from Venus Zine stated, \"Abstract expressionism has finally met its electro-clash match. At times experimental with instrumental song intros and abstrusely minimalist with their lyrics, French duo Miss Kittin & The Hacker would do Franz Kline proud with their knack for scrumptious, slaptastic tunes ideal for the BDSM scene. Conversely, The Independents Simon Price noted that \"the temptation to revisit that blueprint \u2013 Kittin, the elegantly bored Euro-siren, meshing with Hacker's chattering techno textures \u2013 has eventually proven overwhelming. While Two never hits those heights, it has its club-friendly moments.\" Moreover, The Guardians Alex Macpherson concluded that \"on last year's sleek BatBox, she proved there was life in a shtick that, by rights, should have burned out half a decade ago in the dying embers of electroclash. But even as she pulled it off against the odds, one sensed the line between success and failure was being cut ever finer; and, in hooking up with her original partner in crime, The Hacker, Kittin has fallen on the wrong side of it.\" David Raposa from Pitchfork Media described the album \"as a supposed remembrance of the heyday of electroclash, it's a nostalgia trip that's best left untaken.\" Eric Henderson, writing for Slant Magazine, commented that when compared to the duo's First Album, \"The words are flatter, the music is more generically attractive, and maybe we're all getting a little too old for this club.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (2009) !Peak position |- |Belgian Alternative Albums Chart (Flanders) |align=\"center\"|48 |- |Belgian Albums Chart (Wallonia) |align=\"center\"|87 |- |French Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|102 |- |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2009 albums Category:Miss Kittin albums Category:The Hacker albums ",
