    "text": "Black Guards (, ) were armed groups of workers formed after the February Revolution and before the final Bolshevik suppression of other leftwing groups. They were the main strike force of the anarchists. They were created in the Summer of 1917 in Ukraine by Maria Nikiforova, and expanded in January 1918 to Moscow, under the control of anarchists at industrial enterprises by Factory and Plant Committees and by Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups cells. == Origin == Maria Nikiforova organized the Black Guards' first unit. Nikiforova, often known by her nickname Marusya, was a Ukrainian anarchist organiser who put together the first Black Guards cell in the city of Alexandrovsk in the Ukraine. Nikiforova started the first Black Guards cell in an attempt to force land reform and wealth redistribution to fruition. Nikiforova, a self-proclaimed terrorist, directed her unit of Black Guards to terrorize the Alexandrovsk local government in order to achieve the political change she desired. Later similar cells were established by Nestor Makhno throughout other portions of the Ukraine. Makhno, during the revolution, seized land and distributed wealth among the peasants. == Militarization in Ukraine and suppression in Russia == On the night of April 11, 1918, Dzerzhinsky, director of the Cheka, had a force of approximately 5,000 Soviet troops attack the anarchist headquarters in Moscow.Richard Polenberg, Fighting Faiths: The Abrams Case, the Supreme Court, and Free Speech (New York: Cornell University Press, 1987), 348. There was no need to mount a negative political campaign as part of the suppression of the Black Guards because the Black Guards had no political power or support; their power was simply derived from their military strength. Russian revolutionary writer Victor Serge, who was initially part of anarchist movement, believed that much of the Black Guards real capacities was \"wasted on small and chaotic struggles.\"Victor Serge, Year One of the Russian Revolution (Chicago: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1970) Ultimately the legacy of the Black Guards was its serving as a model for the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine, otherwise known as the Black Army. Following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Nestor Makhno formed a Black Guards unit in Ukraine that would later grow into what was formally known as the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine (RIAU). The RIAU may have been considered a continuation of the Black Guards if it were not on a far larger, more organized, and unified scale.Victor Serge, Year One of the Russian Revolution (Chicago: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1970),158. == See also == ==References== == External links == * \"\u0410\u0437\u0431\u0443\u043a\u0430 \u0430\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\" (Russian) * \u041c\u0430\u0445\u043d\u043e \u041d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 (Russian) * \u041d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041c\u0430\u0445\u043d\u043e (\u041c\u0438\u0445\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e) (Russian) * \"\u0421 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432 \u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u044b, \u0433\u0435\u0442\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438 \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0414\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438\" (Russian) Category:Anarchist organizations in Russia Category:Anarchist organizations in Ukraine Category:Communist organizations in Russia Category:Communist organizations in Ukraine Category:Defunct anarchist militant groups Category:Defunct anarchist organizations in Europe Category:Defunct communist militant groups Category:Makhnovism Category:Military units and formations of the Russian Civil War Category:Paramilitary organizations based in Russia Category:Rebel militia groups Category:Soviet opposition groups ",
