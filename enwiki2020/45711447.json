His only match of the season was against Kuk\u00ebsi on 18 December 2013 in the returning leg of 2013\u201314 Albanian Cup second round, where he played the second half in an eventual 4\u20130 away defeat, which resulted Apolonia Fier eliminated with the aggregate 4\u20131.

Fili played his first league match of the season on 26 September 2014 against Kuk\u00ebsi, appearing as a second-half substitute for Renato Na\u00e7i in an eventual 0\u20131 home defeat. He began to gain more playing time by starting his first match of the season on 1 October during the 4\u20130 away win against Dinamo Tirana for the first leg of the first round of 2014\u201315 Albanian Cup. With the arrival of the new coach Artan M\u00ebrgjyshi, who begun focusing on the new players, Fili begun to play more often, playing 63 minutes in the 2\u20130 defeat to Partizani Tirana at home in the first match of the 2015. Fili scored his first goal of the season on 28 February during the 2\u20132 home draw against Kuk\u00ebsi, which earned Apolonia the first point of the second part of the season. Fili continued his fine form by scoring the lone goal against the fellow relegation strugglers Elbasani, giving Apolonia three important points. Only three days later, Fili was on the scoresheet again, scoring against another survival rival, this time Teuta Durr\u00ebs, to give Apolonia its second consecutive league win. On 12 April, Fili scored a winner in the 88th minute against Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb for a 2\u20131 home victory to help Apolonia reducing the gap with Teuta Durr\u00ebs in their bid to escape relegation.

Fili finished his third season with Apolonia Fier by playing 33 matches between league and cup, including 28 in league, scoring five times in the process. He was praised for his performances throughout the season along with the other youngster Myrto Uzuni. They were the target of many Albanian Superliga clubs, but they did not leave due to their contract with the club. After the end of the season, he was named one of the Albanian Superliga Talent of the Season along with his teammate Uzuni and other players. ===Partizani Tirana=== On 12 February 2016, Fili agreed personal terms and joined Albanian Superliga side Partizani Tirana on a three-year deal, taking the vacant squad number 28 for the second part of 2015\u201316 season. Before signing with the club, Fili had to solve an issue with his old club Apolonia Fier who didn't allow him to become a free agent, which lead Fili to send the case to the Dispute Resolution Chamber of AFA. This issue postponed his debut with the first team, as he first needed to debut with the B-team. On 21 February 2016, Fili made his B-team debut in the match against Sh\u00ebnkolli, where he appeared as a 75th- minute substitute for Fabio Hasa in an eventual 1\u20131 home draw. He would make another appearance with the B-team on 6 March during the 1\u20131 away draw against Kevitan, playing full-90 minutes.

Fili missed out the start of the 2017\u201318 Albanian Superliga due to a broken molar which gave him muscle pain and didn't allowed him to make a normal training session. He discovered it later in October 2017 and after fixing it he started to train along the team.

Fili opened his scoring account fourteen days later in the 1\u20132 loss to Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb, netting the opener in 11th minute with shot just outside the box which defeated goalie Orges Shehi; the goal earned notoriety which led Albania media to compare Fili with Alessandro Del Piero. Fili left the club in June 2018 after not agreeing to sign a new contract, finishing his short spell with just 17 league appearances and 2 goals. ===Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb=== On 24 August 2018, Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb announced to have signed Fili on a three-year contract. He made his first appearance for the club on 31 August in the 1\u20131 home draw versus La\u00e7i.

On 4 January of the following, Fili handed a transfer request which was granded, becoming the club's first departure in the winter transfer window.

In an interview, Fili cited the lack of faith shown by coach Orges Shehi and not playing regularly as the main reasons of his departure. ===Luft\u00ebtari Gjirokast\u00ebr=== On 5 January 2019, Fili joined Albanian Superliga relegation strugglers Luft\u00ebtari Gjirokast\u00ebr on a 18-month contract with an option to renew based on his performances. ===Boto\u0219ani=== On 29 January 2020, Fili signed a contract with Romanian club Boto\u0219ani. ==International career== In February 2015, Fili was called up for the first time at the Albania under-21 by coach Sk\u00ebnder Gega in the squad from home league Albanian Superliga to participate in for a 3-days mini preparatory stage in Durr\u00ebs, Albania from 22\u201325 February 2015.
