    "text": "This is a picture of IJK, Lebanese rock artist taken on the set of one of his music videos Imad Jack Karam, known by his initials and stage name IJK, is a Lebanese singer-songwriter now based in Dubai. He is best known for his alternative rock style and crooner sound and has released songs in English despite being a native Lebanese artist. ==Early years== Born in Beirut in 1981, Karam was raised in a Greek Orthodox Christian family and showed a keen interest for music and singing since a very young age. In 2000, Karam took part in the Lebanese Karaoke Championship, which was broadcast on T\u00e9l\u00e9 Liban, and won the third place in the male category. This has been his main motivation to give music a serious shot in later years. == UK Recording Sessions == In 2009, IJK worked with a number of British producers including Steve Williams (who collaborated with big artists such as Sting) and recorded his own music at various studios in London including The Way and The Chapel Studios. The result was his debut EP entitled Dancing Shadows and that included four songs. IJK then went on tour and played at various venues in London including the legendary but now defunct Bull & Gate. In May 2016, he released his single \u201cSpace Odyssey\u201d which garnered positive reviews from fans and critics. In June 2017, IJK released his second single and music video entitled \"Dancing Shadows\". == Music Style and Theme == IJK\u2019s music is characterized by catchy yet sophisticated melodies and a rock and roll inspired style. His music is a combination of piano (or synth) driven rock sound mixed with soaring vocals in the baritone and countertenor range. His lyrics tackle diverse themes ranging from biographies (\u201cJohnny & June\u201d) to philosophical subjects (\u201cSpace Odyssey\u201d). IJK's animated music video for \"Johnny & June\" has won the second place in the Asia category at the Anim'Arte film festival in Brazil. During his interview with MTV Lebanon in March 2017, IJK cited U2's Bono as one of his main music influences. == Discography == *High Tide - Single (2019) *Chedd Halak - Single (2019) *Johnny & June - Single (2018) * Dancing Shadows - Single (2017) * Space Odyssey - Single (2016) == External links == * Official Website * Official Facebook Page == References == Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Lebanese musicians ",
