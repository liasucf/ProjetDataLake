Arthropoda Selecta 27(1): 57-60 ==Distribution== U. koponeni has been described from one female and two immatures, which were collected in 1987, by beating foliage in secondary forest in Kampong Kuap, near Kuching, Sarawak, Borneo. ==Name== The species is named after Finnish arachnologist Seppo Koponen, who turned 70 at the year of description. ==Description== The body of the female is about 3 mm long. The abdomen is unusually long, with a zebra-like pattern and transverse rows of dark long hairs. The abdomen of the female is covered in dark long hears, becoming especially dense and long near at the rear end, and on the spinnerets. This species has the longest spinnerets of any Uroballus, and indeed of any salticid. They are around half as long as the abdomen. ==References== Category:Salticidae Category:Endemic fauna of Borneo Category:Spiders of Asia Category:Spiders described in 2014 ",
