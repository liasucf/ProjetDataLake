Saba is completely broken but develops a very strong bond with Maaz. Soon the Grandmother feels that it would be good if Saba marries Irtaza, as this will benefit Irtaza and Maaz, as they are lonely, and it will also benefit Saba since she has always been in love with him. Saba gets very angry hearing this proposal, as she is extremely guilt ridden, and says that she will never marry Irtaza!

In 2 and half hours, we already have to show a very large story in a limited time in a film, but when it comes to television, we personally like the way the story is narrated. Thus, the progression is completely different; you will get to see a lot that you weren't able to see before. You will find a lot more depth in a few characters, plus, a lot more answers to those unanswered questions. Of course, in a series of 20 episodes, a lot changes.\" While Khan expressed, \"It's not really different. Well, there's a whole new track in it which wasn't in the original, so that's new (Laughs)! Saba is the same, I mean, the variation you would see is that you will see a lot more shades to her. Of course, Bin Roye was just 1 hour and 58 minutes, so you will get to see a lot more intricacies in this.\" ==Episodes== ==Music== The soundtrack of the series is adapted from the film. The original soundtrack of the series is \"Bin Roye\", that is penned by Shakeel Sohail, and composed and sung by Shiraz Uppal. ==Broadcast and release== Bin Roye was originally scheduled to release between April\u2013July 2016, but latter it was announced that it would be released after 2016 Eid-ul-Adha.
