    "text": "Album of Love is a 1982 studio album by The Three Degrees. ==Overview== By the early 1980s The Three Degrees had established themselves as a live attraction and favourite television guests in the UK. After their previous record label Ariola folded in 1980, they found themselves without a contract but that did not discourage the trio, consisting of Helen Scott, Sheila Ferguson and Valerie Holiday. Ferguson co-wrote \"A Sonnet To Love\" and performed lead vocals on that track. Scott was given a rare opportunity to take a full lead on \"I Only Have Eyes for You\". All three shared lead vocals on \"MacArthur Park\" This track, together with the \"Fame Medley\" had recently been performed by the group on their second television special for the BBC, \"Take 3 Degrees\", which had been screened a year earlier. ==Track listing== Side One # \"A Sonnet to Love\" # \"I Only Have Eyes for You\" # \"MacArthur Park\" Side Two # Fame Medley #* \"Fame Intro\" #* \"Dirty Old Man\" #* \"My Simple Heart\" #* \"Year of Decision\" #* \"Take Good Care of Yourself\" #* \"When Will I See You Again\" #* \"Fame Reprise\" # \"Only Those in Love\" # \"Dear God\" # \"Hard to Say I'm Sorry\" ==Personnel== * Sheila Ferguson \u2013 vocals * Valerie Holiday \u2013 vocals * Helen Scott \u2013 vocals * Erwin Keiles \u2013 producer * Jerry Williamson \u2013 engineer * Grant MacAvoy \u2013 drums * Vince Fay \u2013 bass guitar * Richard Rome \u2013 piano * Erwin Keiles \u2013 all guitars * Pete Wingfield \u2013 synthesizers and special keyboards * John Kongos \u2013 programming == References == Category:1982 albums Category:The Three Degrees albums Category:Self-released albums ",
