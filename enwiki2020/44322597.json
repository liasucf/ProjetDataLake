General Rafael Urdaneta was appointed interim president the following day whilst a response from Bol\u00edvar on whether he would return to the Presidency was awaited. However, he refused to accept the post, and gave his support to Urdaneta. Bol\u00edvar died in December. Following a brief civil war in early 1831, Urdaneta left office and elections were held for a Constituent Assembly. Presidential elections were held the following year. ==References== Category:1830 elections in South America 1830 Category:1830 in Gran Colombia ",
