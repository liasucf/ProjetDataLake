    "text": "Wizadora is a children's television programme created by Don Arioli and Carolyne Cullum. It was originally broadcast on SWR in 1991 and it was used as an English-language learning tool for non-English speakers. In 1993, the series was picked up by ITV in the United Kingdom. ==Development== A pilot show starred Fawlty Towers writer and actress Connie Booth, who had been alerted to the character by John Cleese who had taken an interest in the production. The pilot was never broadcast. The concept was then developed into a language teaching tool for children to learn the English language published by Oxford University Press in 1991. Books, audio, and media were produced alongside the series. Originally the title role of Wizadora was initially played by Connie Booth in an unaired pilot before Cathy Lawday played the title role for Oxford University Press. Lawday was also the writer and editor of the books and media produced for Oxford. In 1992, Meridian Broadcasting took up the series. Considerable changes were made for this series. Some major changes included the introduction of Wendy van der Plank as Wizadora, who remained as the character from 1993 to 1996. Lizzie McPhee took over the role in 1997 until the series end. Tatty, who was originally played by a woman, was now played by a man (Joe Greco 1993\u201394, Steven Ryde 1994\u201398) and Phoebe, who was originally played by an actor, was re-introduced as a \"life-sized\" model. Many characters were introduced and the original characters were given a makeover. Connie Booth was brought back in to write episodes for the series among others. == Characters == * Wizadora \u2013 the title character, a trainee wizard who receives her magic wand in the pilot episode, who initially has problems getting her spells right. Some of the things in Wizadora's kitchen are able to talk due to stray spells. Wizadora often breaks the fourth wall and talks to the viewers and usually asks for their help when casting her spells. Wizadora's catchphrases include \"Oh, botheration!\" and \"Time for a bit of Wizzification!\". Wizadora's companions included \u2013 * Tatty Bogle \u2013 a dim- witted scarecrow who lives in Wizadora's back garden and continually gets words muddled up. The character was played by a women before being reintroduced as a man for ITV. Played in the ITV series by Joe Grecohttps://joegreco.wixsite.com/actor/gallery(1993) and Steven Ryde (1994\u20131997). Ryde was the voice-over announcer between programmes for the CITV service during the same period. * Stan the Shopkeeper. He regularly takes delivery of new magical catalogue items and is very cautious of Wizadora's spells. Played by Brian Murphy * Pippa the Postwoman. She rides a bike on her rounds and ofter becomes tired. Played by Tessa Hatts * Top/Sticky/Bottom \u2013 three talking drawer people, who resemble socks. Once described as \"a real nuisance\" by Wizadora, they are very naughty, usually teasing Hangle and/or Filbert, and are always attempting to steal food or getting up to some kind of mischief whenever Wizadora's back is turned. Their antics usually end up causing much trouble; one time Top invented a Grub Grabber to try and steal some food, but the device frightened Filbert who accidentally knocked over some potions, some of which got into Very Old Fish's tank and turned him into a purple blob. Wizadora usually punishes them by zapping them back into their drawers with her wand. * Phoebe \u2013 a talking telephone. Early in the series, Phoebe was played by an actor dressed in a pink costume. In the ITV series Phoebe was re-introduced as a 'life-sized' model telephone, pink with a yellow headset, but later on, she's orange while her headset turns red. From series 6, her headset is red with coloured stars. Phoebe answers calls, takes messages, and speaks various languages. * Filbert (ITV Series 1\u20135 only) \u2013 a squeaking vegetable and a fellow trainee wizard. He is also regularly seen gardening. He was born from a seed in the first ITV series and at first Wizadora had no idea as to who he was. He loves to water the plants and was good friends with Tatty. He also talks in gibberish and in later series, English as the character develops. Filbert often got himself into trouble, although meaning well. In one episode he accidentally washed all of Wizadora's spell books after she told him to do the washing up. * Dog Doormat \u2013 a barking doormat (Only seen in the first Series for ITV only) * Hangle \u2013 a purple coat hanger (but who insists on calling himself a cloak hanger) with a yellow rain coat, glasses and a purple moustache. Has quite an obsession with cleaning. For instance, in the episode 'Hangle's big day' he locks everyone out in the garden because he thinks they are too untidy. As a result, he ends up hurting his back due to being too stubborn. He has a crude sense of humour and is also quite bossy. In the first episode of Series 1, Hangle introduces himself as \"Cliff Hangle, cloak hanger extraordinaire\". * Very Old Fish \u2013 a cryptic talking male fish who told stories about his life. * Poot (ITV Series 2 onwards)\u2013 Wizadora's computer. Poot was often used to help with Wizadora's questions. For series 2 and 3 poot was green and flat shaped. In the later series he changed to a more computer like machine with a pale orange face. * Nigel the Snail- (ITV series Two onwards) A Blue snail who lives with Very old fish. * The Crows (series 3 onwards) \u2013 Borise and his brother Horace cause mayhem for Tatty Bogle in the garden. * Roxy \u2013 a quite friendly talking spider who lives in Tatty's tree house. (Introduced in 1996) * Dusty \u2013 A creature who lives under the fridge, he has a very loud operatic voice and is usually sleeping (seen in the first series for ITV and again in series 6) * Tom and Katy- (Oxford series only) Two children who lived near Wizadora. Not seen in the ITV series. One episode of Wizadora was broadcast on CITV on Saturday, 5 January 2013 (the show's 20th anniversary) as part of a CITV anniversary special.http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a446221/sooty-show-fun-house- press-gang-return-for-citv-30th-birthday.html This was the first time the show has been broadcast in the UK since it was shown on Living TV in the early 2000s. Episodes from the first ITV series are now showing on BritBox as of July 2020. === Other cast and credits === Puppeteers Phil Eason, Francis Wright, Michael Bayliss, Sue Dacre, Don Austen, Brian Herring, Neil Sterenberg, Rebecca Nagan, Debbie Cumming, and Sheila Clark worked on the series. The ITV series was made for Meridian Broadcasting by production companies Workhouse and North Pole Productions at The Fountain Studios in New Malden and directed by David Crozier. Fifteen episodes of Series 3 were directed by Wendy J. Dyer. The theme music was composed by Dave Hutton who was also the Senior Cameraman on the first four series of the show. The theme tune for the ITV series was recorded at Gordon Thrussell's studios at Ashford in Kent and the credits show music by 'Hutt and Thrust'. This was because the director, David Crozier, did not want the same name for two different credits on the programme (i.e.: Snr Cameraman and Music). The other cameramen were Roger Backhouse and Angus Macmillan and sometimes Steve Leach. The vision mixer was Julie Miller. ==Transmission guide== The programme ran for eight series in total. Seven for ITV. : *Running time Series 1: 15 minutes, Series 2 onwards 9 minutes. *Series 1: (Oxford) 8 editions from 15 September 1991 - 3 November 1991 *Series 1: (ITV) 18 editions from 5 January 1993 \u2013 4 May 1993 *Series 2: 30 editions from 6 September 1993 \u2013 15 December 1993 *Series 3: 30 editions from 7 September 1994 \u2013 15 December 1994 *Series 4: 32 editions from 5 September 1995 \u2013 21 December 1995 *Series 5: 30 editions from 10 September 1996 \u2013 19 December 1996 *Series 6: 32 editions from 2 September 1997 \u2013 18 December 1997 One episode of Wizadora was broadcast on CITV on Saturday, 5 January 2013 (the show's 20th anniversary) as part of a CITV anniversary special.http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a446221/sooty-show-fun-house- press-gang-return-for-citv-30th-birthday.html This was the first time the show has been broadcast in the UK since it was shown on Living TV in the early 2000s.

Although a new version of the original theme tune was used and the overall look of the set generally in keeping with the earlier version, characters were given varying makeovers, with none of the original models being used, and several new minor characters introduced. CGI and Chroma key effects featured heavily. The proposed new series was not picked up, reportedly due to it being considered too costly. Although there are no plans for the ITV series to return, the Oxford series is still in production with episodes being repeated on SWR Television. The original Oxford series is still used today as a teaching tool for children to learn English as second language. The DVD, book, and audio tapes are still available to buy online, along with a PC-CD ROM. A free app was produced in 2016. A website was set up in 2015, though it is now defunct as of 2018. In 2016, the German SWR Television Educational Programmes set up a website featuring the series to foster use of Wizadora films and educational games in elementary schools in Germany. Free educational games based on the series have been developed since 2016 (apps for Android, iOS, and web-based for desktop computers) and are available on www.wizadora.de. ==References== == External links == * Wizadora on German TV * * Category:1993 British television series debuts Category:1997 British television series endings Category:1990s British children's television series Category:British television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:British television shows featuring puppetry Category:English-language television shows Category:ITV children's television shows Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:Television shows produced by Meridian Broadcasting Category:Wizards in television ",
