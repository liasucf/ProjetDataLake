    "text": "At least nine ships were employed by the South Australian Company in 1836 to carry its staff and the first European settlers from England to the south coast of Australia for the establishment of the City of Adelaide and the province of South Australia. All nine ships associated with the company were in communication or at least aware of each other during the voyage and were all represented at the proclamation of the new province. The ships began sailing from England in 1836 from January until about June, and arrived on the South Australian coast from July to December that year, when the new province was proclaimed. ==Ships== It is difficult for scholars to arrive at a definitive list of pioneer ships given the lack of extant primary evidence due to poor record keeping and accidental loss of records.The Company's barque South Australian which brought Samuel Stephens's replacement David McLaren to Kingscote, Kangaroo Island on 22 April 1837 is not included in the list. The following list is based on the best available records, ordered chronologically by date of arrival in South Australia. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Ship || Type and burthen (bm) || Master !

George Kingston gives the date of the arrival as 28 July whereas Robert Russell, the second mate, gives the date as 30 July, which is probably correct, as the two vessels spoke to each other on the voyage out, and the Lady Mary was in close company with the Duke. | |- | colspan=5 | Known passengers: |- | rowspan=2 | John Pirie 28 passengers | Schooner | George Martin | 22 February | 16 August | |- | colspan=5 | Known passengers: |- | rowspan=2 | Rapid 24 passengers | Brig,* 162 tons | Col.
