Educ. 2:30. doi: 10.3389/feduc.2017.00030 ==History== The idea for the organization was sparked by an article by Dr. Ralph Crawshaw, published in the December 1984 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. In the article,A Doctor-to- Doctor International Medical Education Exchange JAMA. 1984;252(22):3170-3171. Dr. Crawshaw urged fellow medical practitioners to \"make a substantial difference to your colleagues in developing countries\" and cited the example of Orthopaedics Overseas. In 1986, the Orthopaedics Overseas Board of Directors voted to become the first division of the newly created Health Volunteers Overseas. Two anesthesiologists went to Ethiopia for the first HVO volunteer trip later that year. Since opening its doors in Washington, D.C. in 1986, HVO volunteers have completed more than 11,000 short-term assignments in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the Caribbean, and Oceania.Our History, Health Volunteers Overseas Volunteers are drawn from the fields of anesthesia, dermatology, hematology, internal medicine, nursing education, obstetrics & gynecology, oncology, oral health, orthopaedics, pediatrics, physical therapy, wound and lymphedemia management, emergency medicine, mental health, and pharmacology. ==What problem is HVO addressing?== The delivery of health care services in any country is dependent on a trained cadre of health care professionals. The well-documented global shortage of health care providersWorld Health Organization\u2019s 2006 World Health Report disproportionately impacts resource-scarce countries. Faced with serious resource constraints, as well as an immense burden of disease, these countries are faced with enormous needs in the health care sector but have limited capacity to educate and support the workforce necessary to meet these needs. As a result, not enough health care professionals are trained, few are offered the opportunity for continued professional education and growth, and most work in isolation with little chance to learn from nearby colleagues. The World Health Organization estimates that in 2013, there was a global deficit of more the 17.4 million health workers \u2013 a figure that is predicted to grow to 18 million by the year 2030.Framing the health workforce agenda for the Sustainable Development Goals: biennium report 2016\u20132017 \u2014 WHO Health Workforce. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2017. ==Organizational structure== HVO is governed by a volunteer Board of Directors representing a diverse background of experience and professions. There are more than 185 health care professionals serving in a variety of leadership positions with HVO, providing the framework for managing HVO's extensive portfolio of projects. A staff of thirteen is under the management of the Executive Director. About 80.5% of all HVO expenses are program-related and the organization has $3 million in net assets.HVO Annual Report (2017) === Board of Directors === * Helen Cherrett - Consultant for Global Affairs for the American Dental Association (ADA) * Peter Curran - President of the Peco Foundation * Susan Eitel - Rehabilitation specialist * Richard Fisher - Member of the WHO Expert Panel for Clinical Technology * Richard Henker - Faculty member at the University of Pittsburgh School of Nursing * William C.

Volunteers work alongside their colleagues in resource-scarce countries, providing new insights and techniques. They introduce new teaching methodologies, update or create teaching curricula, and inspire new ways of thinking and problem solving. Nearly 40% of HVO volunteers are repeat volunteers. Volunteers cover their own travel costs and the average out-of- pocket costs associated with an assignment are $2,900. Each year, HVO recognizes and awards one volunteer with the Golden Apple Award. ==Countries served== Health Volunteers Overseas works with local health care professionals in the following countries: *Bhutan *Bolivia *Cambodia *China *Costa Rica *Ghana *Guyana *Haiti *Honduras *India *Laos *Philippines *Malawi *Myanmar *Nepal *Nicaragua *Peru *Rwanda *St. Lucia *Tanzania *Uganda *Vietnam ==References== ==External links== # Health Volunteers Overseas Website # HVO Annual Reports and Audited Financial Statements # Information on global health care crisis, from the Global Health Workforce Alliance # HVO meets 20 out of 20 charity standards of the Better Business Bureau Wise Giving Alliance # Board of Directors Category:Health charities in the United States Category:Charities based in Washington, D.C.
