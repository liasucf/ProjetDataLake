It came from Nigeria originally. It is made from dried grated cassava (manioc) flour, commonly known as garri. To make \u1eb9\u0300b\u00e0, garri flour (which should be further pounded or ground if not already 'fine') is mixed into hot water and stirred well with a wooden spatula until it becomes like a firm dough, firmer than, say, mashed potatoes, so it can be rolled into a ball and can keep its shape. When you put hot water in the bowl of garri to make \u1eb9b\u00e0, you leave it for a few seconds or minutes; then you stir it until i becomes a firm dough; then you can call it \u1eb9\u0300b\u00e0. To eat, a small amount of \u1eb9\u0300b\u00e0 is taken with the fingers and rolled into a small ball and dipped into the \u1ecdb\u1eb9\u0300 (a thick soup) such as okra soup, bitter leaf (ew\u00faro) soup or pepper soup (\u1ecdb\u1eb9\u0300 ata or \u1eb9\u0300f\u1ecd\u0301 depending on dialect) with either okro, \u1ecdgb\u1ecdn\u1ecd (Igbo)/ap\u1ecdn (Yor\u00f9b\u00e1), or ew\u00e9d\u00fa, meat or fish, stewed vegetables or other sauces such as gb\u1eb9\u0300g\u00ecr\u00ec, Amiedi (banga soup) or egusi soup (melon). \u1eb8\u0300b\u00e0 can either come in yellow or an off white colour. It comes in yellow, when it is mixed with palm oil. Garri is very rich in starch and carbohydrate. It is quite heavy as a meal and a staple food of West Africans. It is often eaten with richly made soups and stews, with beef, stockfish or mutton depending on personal taste. ==See also== *Amala *Cassava *Egusi sauce *Fufu *Garri *Pounded yam *Sadza *Ugali *Bread ==References== ==External links== *My destination Nigeria * * Category:African cuisine Category:Nigerian cuisine Category:Staple foods Category:Yoruba cuisine Category:Cassava dishes ",
