All SS models come with distinctive \"SS\" markings on their exterior. The SS package was first made available for the 1961 Impala. Some of the other models bearing the SS badge include the Camaro, Chevelle, El Camino, Impala, Monte Carlo, Nova and Chevrolet Pickup Truck. Current SS models are produced by the GM Performance Division. General Motors Company's Australian subsidiary Holden offers SS models in its range of Holden Commodore sedans and sportwagons,Commodore, www.holden.com.au Retrieved 10 January 2017 and also in the Holden Ute range of two-door coup\u00e9 utilities.Ute, www.holden.com.au Retrieved 10 January 2017 ==History== In December 1956, Chevrolet unveiled a show car based on the first generation (C1) Corvette called the Corvette Super Sport. In early 1957, the Chevrolet Corvette SS debuted \u2014 a custom built racing sports car that was the first Chevrolet to wear the SS badge. In 1961, the SS \"kit\" (known as a sport and appearance package) was offered on any Impala for just $53.80. The package included Super Sport trim for both the interior and exterior, chassis reinforcements, stronger springs and shocks, power brakes, spinner wheel covers, and narrow-band whitewall tires. The car's dashboard received a Corvette style passenger hand bar and a steering column mounted 7000-rpm tachometer. Chevrolet built 491,000 Impalas that year and 453 had the SS package, of which 311 received the 348 cid and 142 received the 409 cid.http://musclecars.howstuffworks.com/classic-muscle-cars/1961-chevrolet- impala-ss-409.htm Since 1994, the SS package has been used on a variety of GM vehicles, including pickup trucks, four-door sedans, and front wheel drive cars. Both historically and today, the Super Sport package has typically included high-performance tires, heavy-duty suspension, and increased power, along with a variety of other performance and appearance upgrades.

Unlike the contemporary Nova, it was built as a hardtop, without fixed #2 or B-pillars or frames around the door glass. ===Brazilian market=== Classics: * Chevrolet Opala: 250 I6 producing 1971\u20131974 * Chevrolet Opala: 250-S I6 producing 1974\u20131980 * Chevrolet Opala 151-S I4 producing 1974\u20131980 New Era: * Chevrolet Astra I4 producing 2006 * Chevrolet Corsa I4 producing 2006 * Chevrolet Meriva I4 producing 2006 ==Concept car== Chevrolet SS concept (front) at the 2004 Los Angeles Auto Show In 2003, Chevrolet released a concept car they named the SS. A rear wheel drive sports car with a modern 430 hp small-block V8 engine and race-tuned suspension, it was billed as \"a modern interpretation of Chevrolet's Super Sport heritage\". Though never intended for production, the vehicle was used as a show car and to hint at what was ahead for Chevrolet sports car design. ==Collectors market== It is usually easy to visually differentiate an SS from a \"plain- Jane\" model. However, it is more difficult to tell the difference between a genuine SS and a \"clone\", a non-SS vehicle that has been altered to look like an SS. Because of the number of SS clones in the marketplace, potential buyers are advised to do their research and contact their local car clubs for help to ensure that the vehicle is a true SS by running the VIN codes and casting numbers on the engine (this also includes the vehicle's build sheet especially if the SS package was a factory option). Other non-SS vehicles altered to appear like them only use trim panels rather than aftermarket mechanical parts. ==References== ==External links== * RSportsCars: Chevrolet SS Concept Car * Super Sport Camaros Category:Chevrolet Category:Muscle cars Category:Official motorsports and performance division of automakers ",
