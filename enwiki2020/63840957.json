    "text": "The Jacksonville Downtown Historic District is a national historic district in downtown Jacksonville, Illinois. The district encompasses a commercial area surrounding Central Park, the city's public square. Development in the district began in 1825, when Jacksonville was platted and the public square was created; the first buildings on the square were built the same year. Most of the buildings in the district were built between the 1840s and 1940s, and a large number were built during a late nineteenth century building boom. Seven of the buildings were once cigar stores, a reflection of Jacksonville's large cigar making industry. The district includes examples of many of the popular architectural styles of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; Italianate and Victorian buildings are especially common. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 14, 2018. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Morgan County, Illinois Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Italianate architecture in Illinois Category:Victorian architecture in Illinois ",
