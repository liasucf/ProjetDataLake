It was held in February 1868 and named after Oliver Cromwell, manager of the local Alexandra Theatre (not the Lord Protector), who donated the cup. He also played for the Garrick club. The tournament was only open to teams under two years old. The final was held at Bramall Lane, Sheffield. The trophy is still held in the Sheffield Wednesday trophy cabinet. Sheffield Rules at the time involved rouges as well as goals. Garrick were expected to sweep aside the newly created Wednesday team. Despite this the final remained 0(0)-0(0) at the end of the regulation 90 minutes. Both captains then agreed to carry on playing for a result with the scorer of the first goal taking the trophy. After another 10 minutes of play, Wednesday finally broke the deadlock with a goal, thus claiming their first trophy, and laying claim to scoring the first ever Golden Goal (though that term was not used at the time). ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" |-bgcolor=#D0E7FF !Date!!Team 1!!Goals (Rouges)!!Team 2!!Ground |- |colspan=5|First Round |- ||1 February 1868||The Wednesday||align=center|4 (3) \u2013 0 (0)||Exchange||Mackenzie Ground |- ||8 February 1868||Garrick||align=center|0 (1) \u2013 0 (0)||Wellington||Mackenzie Ground |- |colspan=5|Final |- ||15 February 1868||The Wednesday||align=center|1 (0) \u2013 0 (0) a.s.d.e.t.||Garrick||Bramall Lane |} ==See also== * The Youdan Cup \u2013 the world's first football tournament ==External links== *Report on the tournament Category:Sport in Sheffield Category:Defunct football cup competitions in England Category:Defunct football competitions in South Yorkshire Category:1868 in English sport Category:1868 in association football Category:1867\u201368 in English football ",
