The title is a reference to both the Nazi mass Nuremberg Rallies held in Nuremberg from 1933, at the beginning of the regime, and to the Nuremberg Trials (1945-1946), after its fall. == Synopsis == Two versions of the film, a short and a long one, respectively cut into two or four parts.

To keep the film as neutral as possible, the text was eventually read by Meyer himself, as to make certain that no affect would taint it.\u00c9crire \"De Nuremberg \u00e0 Nuremberg\", entretiens de Vianney Delourme avec Philippe Meyer, bonus du DVD De Nuremberg \u00e0 Nuremberg, \u00e9ditions Montparnasse, 2003. Meyer stated that some of the cited facts, such as the German-Soviet non-aggression pact and some of its implications (notably petrol for the German planes involved in the bombings of London originating in the Soviet Union) were not well-known to the public in 1986, and that the documentary allowed some viewers to learn some details of the war. The film was delivered to Antenne 2 in 1987, but was not released for two years: firstly, it was not aired until after the French presidential election of 1988, as to avoid any semblance of opposition to its far-right candidate; furthermore, arguments such as \u00ab the French being divided \u00bb on the subject, or the notion that \u00ab Nazism does not interest anyone anymore \u00bb, were put forwards and retarded the release. == Notes and references == === Notes === === References === Category:French documentary films Category:French films Category:Documentary films about historical events Category:Documentary films about World War II Category:Holocaust films Category:Films scored by Vangelis ",
