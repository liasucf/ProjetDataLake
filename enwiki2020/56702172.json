    "text": "Aspire is a minor political party in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets made up of councillors elected as members of Tower Hamlets First. After Tower Hamlets First was removed from the register following voting fraud and malpractice, its councillors formed the Tower Hamlets Independent Group (THIG). After some defections, the remaining Tower Hamlets Independent Group councillors later registered formally as a political party in January 2018. Most of its elected members were former Labour Party members, but there are a few exceptions. It was the largest and the main political opposition with elected councillors at the Tower Hamlets Council prior to the 2018 May elections. ==Background== Tower Hamlets First was established by Lutfur Rahman on 18 September 2013. The party stood candidates in the 2014 Tower Hamlets Council election, where it won 18 out of 45 seats, becoming the second-largest party on Tower Hamlets Council and the fifth-largest political party out of all London borough councils. The party was suspended in 23 April 2015, after an election court report that found Rahman \"personally guilty of 'corrupt or illegal practices' or both\" with the party labelled as a \"one-man band\". The party was removed from the list of political parties maintained by the Electoral Commission on 29 April 2015. Following the dissolution of Tower Hamlets First, the majority of former party members established the Tower Hamlets Independent Group (THIG) to co-ordinate activity on the council. Six members subsequently left the Tower Hamlets Independents to form the competing People's Alliance group. Although barred from running for elected office himself, Rahman is behind the party; Aspire is his second attempt at a new party after an application under the name 'Tower Hamlets Together' was rejected. ==Initial representation== Between its formation and the May 2018 elections, Aspire councillors occupied 10 of the 45 council seats on the Tower Hamlets Council. {| class=\"wikitable\" !Name !Ward |- |Ohid Ahmed |Lansbury |- |Suluk Ahmed |Spitalfields & Banglatown |- |Mahbub Alam |St Dunstan's |- |Gulam Kibria Choudhury |Poplar |- |Harun Miah |Shadwell |- |Md.

Maium Miah was formerly a Conservative Party councillor for Millwall before joining Tower Hamlets First, and stood in Canary Wharf ward in 2014.
