    "text": "This Diamond Ring is the debut studio album by American band Gary Lewis & the Playboys, and was released in 1965 on Liberty Records, LRP-3408. It is the first of three charting albums released by the band in 1965. ==Background== The group was formed in 1964 and was originally known as Gary & the Playboys. Producer Snuff Garrett saw them performing at Disneyland and he brought them into the studio to record the single \"This Diamond Ring\". He also had the band change their name to Gary Lewis & the Playboys to capitalize on Gary's famous father, comedian/actor Jerry Lewis. The success of the single led them to record a whole album of mostly covers of popular songs by the Kinks, Bobby Rydell, the Coasters, and others. The album was the second highest charting original album of their career. The single \"This Diamond Ring\" launched a string of seven Top 10 hits for the group. The album is somewhat notable in that it marked the beginning of long successful careers for musicians Al Kooper and Leon Russell. ==Dispute regarding musicians on the album== Over the years, there has been much discussion regarding the roles of various musicians used on the album sessions. Garrett used The Wrecking Crew as session players on the whole album. Lewis has stated in interviews: Producer Garrett remembers it differently, stating: There is also a question regarding whether Carol Kaye contributed bass on some tracks. ==Track listing== # \"This Diamond Ring\" (Al Kooper, Bob Brass, Irwin Levine) \u2013 2:05 (Kooper's name is misspelled on the original vinyl labels) # \"Dream Lover\" (Bobby Darin) \u2013 2:23 # \"All Day And All of the Night\" (Ray Davies) \u2013 1:52 # \"Forget Him\" (Mark Anthony) \u2013 2:10 # \"Needles and Pins\" (Jack Nitzsche, Sonny Bono) \u2013 2:00 # \"Love Potion Number 9\" (Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller) \u2013 1:51 # \"Keep Searchin'\" (Del Shannon) \u2013 1:54 # \"The Birds and the Bees\" (Barry Stuart) \u2013 2:01 # \"Sweet Little Rock And Roller\" (Chuck Berry) \u2013 2:17 # \"Go To Him\" (Sonny Curtis, Tom Lesslie) \u2013 2:00 # \"The Night Has A Thousand Eyes\" (Ben Weisman, Dottie Wayne, Marilyn Garrett) \u2013 3:02 # \"The Best Man\" (Cliff Crofford) \u2013 2:21 ==Personnel== ===Gary Lewis and the Playboys=== * Gary Lewis \u2013 vocals, drums * Dave Walker \u2013 lead guitar, vocals * Dave Costell \u2013 guitar * Al Ramsay \u2013 bass * John R.
