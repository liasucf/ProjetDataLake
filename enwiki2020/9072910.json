    "text": "\"Listen Up!\" is a single by the band Gossip, released in 2006, and taken from the album Standing in the Way of Control. It was re-released in 2007, peaking at number 39 on the UK Singles Chart in this second run. The \"Tronik Youth\" remix was included on the nightclub Cream's compilation Cream Summer 2007. ==Video== There are two versions of this music video. In the original version, directed by Morgen Dye, Beth Ditto is eating a pizza in response to jibes about her weight and several young people dancing to the track. In the 2007 version (billed as the radio version), a transgender woman and a transgender man walk around Portland, Oregon, cruising during the day, then later in the evening at a club the two stare at each other from across the dance floor and they start dancing together. ==Track listing== ===UK CD single=== # \"Listen Up!\" (Album version) # \"Listen Up!\" # \"Listen Up!\" (Tronik Youth remix) # \"Are You That Somebody\" # \"Listen Up!\" (Video) ===UK 7-inch (2006)=== # \"Listen Up!\" # \"Are You That Somebody\" ===UK 7-inch (2007)=== # \"Listen Up!\" (Radio edit) # \"Listen Up!\" (MSTRKRFT mix) ===UK 7-inch picture disc (2007)=== # \"Listen Up!\" (2007 version) # \"Listen Up!\" (Live at the Astoria) ==Personnel== * Beth Ditto \u2013 vocals * Brace Paine \u2013 guitar, bass guitar * Hannah Blilie \u2013 drums ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2006) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2006 singles Category:2006 songs Category:2007 singles Category:Columbia Records singles Category:Gossip (band) songs Category:LGBT-related songs Category:Songs written by Beth Ditto Category:Songs written by Brace Paine Category:Songs written by Hannah Blilie ",
