    "text": "The 1975\u201376 season was Sport Lisboa e Benfica's 72nd season in existence and the club's 42nd consecutive season in the top flight of Portuguese football, covering the period from 1 July 1975 to 30 June 1976. Benfica competed domestically in the Primeira Divis\u00e3o and the Ta\u00e7a de Portugal, and participated in the European Cup after winning the previous league. In the midst of the PREC, Benfica changes managers, with Milorad Pavi\u0107 leaving for M\u00e1rio Wilson. In the transfer window, Benfica lost several historic players, notably Eus\u00e9bio, Ant\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es, Adolfo Calisto, Artur Jorge and Jaime Gra\u00e7a. With almost no new signings, Benfica campaign started with a home draw against Boavista, which would become his main rival all season. They reached an isolated first place by early October, only to lose after a defeat against Belenenses. Still, they remained in first, ex aequo with other teams, until they drew in Braga and were overtaken by Boavista. Meanwhile, in Europe, the opening rounds of the European Cup saw Benfica defeat Fenerbah\u00e7e by 7\u20131 on aggregate, and \u00dajpesti D\u00f3zsa by 6\u20135 after a tight match in Hungary. In the Primeira Divis\u00e3o, Benfica lapped the first half of the season with a point less than Boavista. After defeating them on match-day 16, Benfica regained the lead, but only briefly, as they lost it two weeks later, when Leix\u00f5es beat them. Both teams remained at the front, until Boavista conceded two consecutive losses in March and gave Benfica a four-point lead. Despite that, March also cost Benfica competitions, with the European Cup falling after a 5\u20131 loss Bayern Munich and the Portuguese Cup to a one-nil loss to Sporting. Benfica won the following matches in April and celebrated their back-to-back league title on 10 May, the club's 22nd. ==Season summary== In the aftermath of the Carnation Revolution, the country was experiencing the Processo Revolucion\u00e1rio Em Curso, a troubled time which followed the revolution. The club was experiencing financial problems, with a director saying in a members meet in April 1975, that Benfica could end in two or three months. Milorad Pavi\u0107 brought the title back to Benfica, but did not wish to continue and departed the club, being replaced by M\u00e1rio Wilson on 30 May 1975. In the transfer window, Benfica lost two historic club players, Eus\u00e9bio and Ant\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es, plus others important players of the past such as Adolfo Calisto, Artur Jorge and Jaime Gra\u00e7a. They also had to sell Humberto Coelho due to the economic situation. The club made almost no new signings, with Romeu Silva and Eduardo Lu\u00eds being the more noteworthy. Having appointed Fernando Cabrita as his assistant manager, the pre-season began on 22 July. Initially, the training sessions would be in Ferreira do Z\u00eazere, but financial constraints, caused it to be moved to Carcavelos. For preparation, Benfica played in Germany with Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, competed in the II Trof\u00e9u Villa de Bilbao with Queen Park Rangers, Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao. Afterwards, they embarked on a tour to Australia and Indonesia, playing seven matches in 15 days, before finishing the pre-season on 5 September with Paris Saint- Germain. Benfica opened their league campaign with a reception to Boavista, where they drew 0\u20130. They reacted well and won the next four matches, reaching top of the table with 9 points, one more than Boavista and Braga. Meanwhile, in the opening round of the European Cup, Benfica thrashed Fenerbah\u00e7e by winning 7\u20130 at home, with a one-nil loss in Turkey. Domestically, on match-day 6, Benfica lost 4\u20132 away with Belenenses and was caught at the lead by four other teams. They followed that loss with three consecutive wins, before a dropping points in Est\u00e1dio 1\u00ba de Maio with Braga. That cost them the first place, as Boavista overtook them, with a point more. In the European Cup, Benfica faced the Hungarian team \u00dajpesti D\u00f3zsa, defeating them by 5\u20132 at home. In the return leg, the Hungarians dominated and reached 3\u20130 in the second half; even had the opportunity to score the fourth before Nen\u00e9 scored on the 73rd minute to make it 6\u20135 on aggregate. In December, Benfica won the first three matches, before dropping points with Sporting on the 28. By the New Year, Boavista led the league by a point. In the first match in 1976, Benfica visited Est\u00e1dio das Antas and beat Porto by 3\u20132. As Boavista had won in Est\u00e1dio de Alvalade, they lapped the first half of the season, still in second place. On the opening match of the second half, Benfica visited Est\u00e1dio do Bessa to play the leaders Boavista, winning 4\u20131 and assuming the first place with a one-point lead. They would stay at the front only two weeks, because on 26 January, in a match played in Bessa, Benfica lost one-nil with Leix\u00f5es. They were back in second with 29 points; a point less than Boavista who had won at home. A week later, it was Boavista turn to lose points and Benfica catch them again in the lead, all level with 31 points. On 16 February, Benfica lost points again with Belenenses, but took advantage of the Boavista's draw with Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es, to keep the lead, albeit still shared with them. In March, Benfica's opening game was the home leg of the quarter-final of the European Cup with Bayern Munich, with a result being a 0\u20130 draw. Wilson blamed German goalkeeper Maier for his team's lack of goals. In the Primeira Divis\u00e3o, on 8 March, Benfica defeated Farense at home by 3\u20130, while Boavista lost in Antas with Porto. That allowed Benfica to isolate himself in the lead with 38 points, two more than Boavista. A week later, another win for Benfica, away against Estoril Praia, with Boavista losing again, now at home with Uni\u00e3o de Tomar. They were now with a four-point lead over Boavista with six matches to go. On 17 March, Benfica visited the Olympiastadion to play Bayern Munich. They were thrashed, losing 5\u20131. According to Wilson, losing a player (V\u00edtor Martins) to injury altered the team strategy, but he also pointed to several mistakes by referee Hilmi Ok that favoured Bayern. Nonetheless, a few days later, he admitted that Benfica's team was enough to play domestically, but insufficient in the European stage. Benfica concluded March with a Portuguese Cup game against Sporting, where they lost one-nil with a goal in overtime. With the league campaign approaching the end, Benfica continued their winning path in April, and secured their back-to-back league title on 10 May with a win in Bonfim against Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal. It was the club's 22nd in 42 editions. With the title won, in the final two match-days, Benfica won in Alvalade against Sporting and lost at home with Porto. Rui Jord\u00e3o was the Bola de Prata with 30 goals, one more than Nen\u00e9, the second leading scorer. Despite winning the title, President Borges Coutinho expressed his desire to have a British manager at the helm, which signalled the departure of M\u00e1rio Wilson. ==Competitions== ===Overall record=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"| Competition !rowspan=\"2\"| First match !rowspan=\"2\"| Last match !colspan=\"9\"| Record |- !G !W !D !L !GF !GA !GD !Win % !Source |- | align=left| Primeira Divis\u00e3o | align=left| 10 September 1975 | align=left| 30 May 1976 | align=left| |- | align=left| Ta\u00e7a de Portugal | align=left| 28 March 1976 | align=left| 28 March 1976 | align=left| |- | align=left| European Cup | align=left| 17 September 1975 | align=left| 17 March 1976 | align=left| |- ! colspan=\"3\"| Total |} ===Primeira Divis\u00e3o=== ====League table==== ====Results by round==== ====Matches==== ===Ta\u00e7a de Portugal=== ===European Cup=== ====First round==== ====Second round==== ====Quarter-final==== ===Friendlies=== ==Player statistics== The squad for the season consisted of the players listed in the tables below, as well as staff member M\u00e1rio Wilson (manager), Fernando Cabrita (assistant manager). * ==Transfers== ===In=== {| class=\"wikitable unsortable\" |- !
