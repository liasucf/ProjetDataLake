He settled in Lexington, Massachusetts and continued his musical studies as a special student at the New England Conservatory and later at Brandeis University. In 1980 he received a fellowship to the McDowell Colony. In 1991 he was the first American composer to be invited by the government of the newly independent Armenia to visit the country for rehearsals and performances of his chamber music. He has since visited the country several times for performances of his works. His piano concerto received its world premiere in 2016 in Yerevan to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Armenia's independence.Armenian Mirror-Spectator (25 August 2016). \"Music by Hayg Boyadjian to Be Performed in Belgium, Armenia\".

Boyadjian is an active amateur astronomer and a member of the Amateur Telescope Makers of Boston. Several of his works, including Perseus (written for flautist Doriot Anthony Dwyer) and Cassiopeia (written for clarinetist Jonathan Cohler), are inspired by constellations. The shape of the notes on the stave for the work's principal motif reflects the shape of the constellation itself.Fraknoi, Andrew (August 2016). \"Interdisciplinary Approaches to Astronomy: The Music of the Spheres (Part 2)\".
