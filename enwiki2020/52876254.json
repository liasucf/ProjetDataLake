Jen Bergstrom is the Senior Vice President and Publisher. == History == Simon & Schuster created the Gallery Books imprint in 2009 to unite the editorial teams of Pocket Books and Simon Spotlight Entertainment (or SSE), and Gallery Books launched its first list in 2010. Louise Burke was named executive vice-president and publisher while Jennifer Bergstrom, who had been publisher of SSE, would be editor-in-chief. Gallery\u2019s initial mission was to focus on women's fiction, pop culture and entertainment. Simon & Schuster announced a reorganization in October 2012 that created four divisions, with the Gallery Publishing Group as one. When the reorganization was complete, Gallery Publishing Group consisted of Gallery Books, Pocket Books, Pocket Star, and Karen Hunter Books. In the years since, Pocket Star and Karen Hunter Books have been disbanded, while new imprints have been created. Pocket Books, which was founded in 1939 and was instrumental in introducing the pocket-size book to the American market, remains active and continues to publish mass-market editions. In 2015 the Gallery Publishing Group launched literary fiction imprint Scout Press with Ruth Ware\u2019s debut, In a Dark, Dark Wood. The imprint has continued to publish all of New York Times bestselling author Ware\u2019s books, along with ambitious fiction by authors including Candice Carty Williams, Kristen Roupenian, Andrew MacDonald, and Iain Reid.\u201d In July 2016, Gallery Books announced a new line of graphic books called Gallery 13. The imprint has published the highest quality visual storytelling by creators including Stephen King, Stan Lee, and James O\u2019Barr. In August 2017, Jennifer Bergstrom became senior vice president and publisher following the retirement of Louise Burke. In March 2019, the all- inclusive fantasy and science fiction imprint Saga Press moved from Simon & Schuster\u2019s Children\u2019s Publishing Group to Gallery. Saga publishes bestselling and esteemed authors including Charlaine Harris, Stephen Graham Jones, Rebecca Roanhorse, and Ken Liu. Gallery Books \u2013 Gallery Publishing Group\u2019s core, general-interest imprint \u2013 has expanded its mission and scope over time and now publishes books in a wide array of categories, including commercial fiction, memoir, and narrative nonfiction. == Imprints == * Gallery Books, general interest imprint * Pocket Books, mass market imprint of the Gallery group * Scout Press, literary fiction imprint * Gallery 13, graphic novel imprint * Saga Press, science fiction and fantasy imprint == Notable authors == Simon & Schuster has published thousands of books from thousands of authors.
