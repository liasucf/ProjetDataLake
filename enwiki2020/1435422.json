Jagata-kun roughly translates as, \"little, fat potato boy\". ==Geography== *Located approximately west of Sapporo. Kutchan lies in a valley surrounded by mountains, notably Niseko Annupuri and Mount Y\u014dtei. Kutchan as seen from Asahigaoka Park *Mountains: Y\u014dtei (Shiribeshi Mountain) (Makkari-Nupuri in Ainu) (active volcano, 1898 m), Niseko Iwaonupuri (active volcano, 1116 m), Niseko Annupuri (1308 m) *Rivers: Shiribetsu, Kut\u014dzan ===Neighboring municipalities=== *Shiribeshi **Abuta District: Ky\u014dgoku, Niseko **Isoya District: Rankoshi **Iwanai District: Ky\u014dwa **Yoichi District: Niki, Akaigawa **Kimobetsu and Makkari of the Abuta District lie on the southern side of Mount Y\u014dtei. ==Climate== Kutchan has the distinction of being one of the snowiest towns on earth with average annual snowfalls in excess of . At only above sea level the town receives greater amounts of snow than the world's leading ski areas such as Whistler, Aspen or Chamonix. Wintery weather lasts from early November through to early April with the snowiest month being January which averages . January is also the coldest month averaging . Kutchan has 4 very distinct seasons with reasonably short spring and autumn periods. The summer is mild with temperatures rarely getting above and the humidity that afflicts much of Asia at this time is only felt for a short period, usually in August. ==History== *Kutchan's name comes from the language of the Hokkaido's native Ainu people. It attempts to mimic the pronunciation of the Ainu word ku-shan-i (which roughly translates as \u201cthe place where the channel flows\u201d), but some claim that the name is derived from kucha-an-nai (\u201cstream of a hunting lodge\u201d). *1892: Cultivation begins by colonizers from Tokushima Prefecture who had settled in nearby Yoichi. *1893: The village of Kutchan is established. It falls under the jurisdiction of the Abuta village town office (present-day T\u014dyako). *1896: The town office of Kutchan opens. *1899: Changes jurisdiction from Muroran Subprefecture (present-day Iburi Subprefecture) to Iwanai Subprefecture. *1906: Administered as a second-level municipality. *1910: On February 8, Rusutsu, Iwanai, and Otaru\u2019s subprefectures were consolidated into Abuta District of Muroran Subprefecture. Shiribeshi Subprefecture is established in Kutchan. On April 5, the satellite village of East Kutchan (present-day Ky\u014dgoku) is formed. Nisekoan, Higa, and the Fujizan area become part of the Shutai village administration zone (present-day Niseko) *1916: Administered as a town-level municipality *1991: 100-year anniversary is celebrated. ==Economy== ===Hirafu=== Kutchan hosts the Hirafu skiing area. Hirafu is commonly mistaken as a section of Niseko town since it is a part of the greater Niseko skiing region. However, to the financial benefit of Kutchan, Hirafu lies within the confines of Kutchan town. Hirafu's largest ski resort, Niseko Grand Hirafu, draws the highest number of both domestic and foreign skiers and snowboarders than any other resort in the Niseko region. It is linked to the ski areas of Annupuri, Higashiyama, and Hanazono which together may be skied on one lift pass. In recent years, an explosively high number of Australians have frequented Hirafu, many of whom have settled in the area and spawned businesses such as pensions, bars, and cafes. Hirafu is also frequented by a considerable number of tourists from Hong Kong, as well as tourists coming from within Japan. Hirafu's expanding tourism industry is often attributed to the steady and copious supply of fresh powder snow, which many claim is among the best in the entire hemisphere, if not the world. While Hirafu's economic boom is undoubtedly an asset to Kutchan town, many fear that such rapid development will alter the price margin of goods and services offered in the village, and subsequently transform the local flavor of Hirafu. The local community of both Japanese and foreign \"backpacker\" skiers and snowboarders, who typically operate on a smaller budget than their upscale counterparts, are already being overshadowed by the burgeoning influx of wealthy tourists. ===Agriculture=== Along with short grain white rice, much of Kutchan's surrounding area is devoted to potato cultivation. ==Culture== As the main regional center of population, Kutchan hosts a variety of cultural institutions and events. The town is home to two museums, the Kutchan Natural History Museum and the Shu Ogawara Art Museum. It also hosts the annual Mt. Niseko Kutchan Jazz Festival every July in the center of town, drawing thousands to enjoy the music of Japanese and Australian musicians. ===Jagata- kun=== Jagata-kun, the skiing potato, sitting on top of purple skis in front of Kutchan train station. is Kutchan's mascot cartoon character. Due to the heavy snowfalls in the region, Kutchan hosts several alpine resorts frequented by domestic and international skiers and snowboarders. In the summer, Kutchan is best known for its primary agricultural product: potatoes. The town's two main industries (ski resorts and potato farming) are both reflected in Jagata- kun, a skiing potato. ==Education== *Public High Schools **Hokkaido Kutchan High School, Hokkaido Kutchan Agriculture High School *Middle Schools **Kutchan *Elementary Schools **Kutchan, Hokuyo, Higashi, Nishi, Kabayama Branch School ==Transportation== *Railroad **Hokkaido Passenger Railroad Company (JR Hokkaido) ***Hakodate Main Line: Hirafu Station \u2013 Kutchan Station **Formerly, the Iburi Line served Kutchan from Date's Monbetsu Station of the Muroran Line, but it was discontinued in 1986. **JR Hokkaido plans to include Kutchan in its planned Hokkaido Shinkansen (bullet train) service, which would connect the town to Honsh\u016b and, consequently, Tokyo. *Roadway **General national highways ***Route 5 ***Route 276 ***Route 393 **Prefectural highways ***Hokkaido Route 58 (Kutchan \u2013 Niseko) ***Hokkaido Route 271 (Kutchan stop) ***Hokkaido Route 343 (Rankoshi \u2013 Niseko \u2013 Kutchan) ***Hokkaido Route 478 (Kyogoku \u2013 Kutchan) ***Hokkaido Route 631 (Niseko \u2013 Takahara \u2013 Hirafu) *Air **New Chitose Airport is the closest major airport to the town, about 2 hours away by car.Niseko Mt Resort Grand Hirafu ==Places of interest== *Mount Y\u014dtei *Niseko Annupuri *Niseko Mt.
