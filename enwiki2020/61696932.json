    "text": "The UAAP Season 82 basketball tournaments were the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) basketball tournaments for the 2019\u201320 school year. Jensen Ilagan, the technical director of the regional ASEAN Basketball League was appointed commissioner for the season's basketball tournaments on August 6, 2019. The senior men\u2019s and women\u2019s tournaments began on September 4, 2019, while the juniors' division which was sub-hosted by National University held their opening games on November 13 for the boys' tournament and on January 11, 2020 for the newly-formed girls' competition. The men's defending champions Ateneo Blue Eagles won all 14 elimination round games to become the only second men's basketball team to advance to the UAAP Finals outright (after UE in 2007). The remaining Final Four teams figured in the stepladder format to determine Ateneo's finals opponent. UST defeated FEU in the first round to meet UP in the second round, who are holding their first twice-to-beat advantage in the Final Four era. The Growling Tigers defeated the Fighting Maroons twice to deny UP's finals rematch against Ateneo and become the lowest-seeded basketball team in UAAP history to have competed in the championship round. In the first #1 vs #4 UAAP Finals match-up in any of the league's events, the Blue Eagles swept the finals for a second consecutive year, being crowned undefeated champions (and the first men's basketball team in UAAP history to pose a 16-0 season win sweep record). Graduating player Thirdy Ravena became the first athlete in UAAP history to win three consecutive Finals MVP awards. The women's defending champions NU Lady Bulldogs also won all elimination round games. In the stepladder, FEU outlasted Adamson in the first round, to meet #2 seeded UST in the next round. UST needed its twice-to-beat advantage to eliminate the Lady Tamaraws from contention. The Tigresses fell short against the NU Lady Bulldogs, who were without their best player Jack Animam, who was injured. The Lady Bulldogs won their sixth consecutive title, all undefeated seasons. The juniors' division introduced a girls' tournament, a demonstration sport. The boys' defending champions, the NSNU Bullpups, finished the elimination round undefeated. Last year's finalist, the Ateneo Blue Eaglets, were defeated by the Adamson Baby Falcons in the first round of the stepladder. FEU arranged a Finals match-up with the Bullpups after beating the Baby Falcons in the second round. The Bullpups finished the season undefeated though, winning both Finals games. The inaugural girls' tournament featured four teams, with the top 2 teams qualifying to the Finals. The Adamson Lady Baby Falcons finished the elimination round undefeated, while the UST Junior Tigresses fended off the DLSZ Lady Junior Archers in their last elimination round game to qualify to the Finals. The two teams split the first two Finals games, with the second game held behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The UAAP then canceled the tournament, declaring both teams co-champions. ==Teams== All eight member universities of the UAAP fielded teams in all two divisions. Only four high schools fielded in teams for the inaugural girls' basketball tournament. {|class=wikitable |- !University !! Men's team !! Women's team !! Boys' team !!

Gian Nazario who had been listed by La Salle as their coach clarified that the school is yet to make an announcement regarding Byrd's official appointment. Bong Tan, who had replaced Joe Silva as coach explained the unique setup in their team. With Chongson as consultant, he is able to trust him and take a backseat during games. Tan died on November 11, 2019. It was reported that he had collapsed while playing in a basketball game in Mandaluyong. {|class=wikitable |- !University !! Men's coach !! Women's coach !!

UST has been eliminated in the semifinals for two years in Seasons 80 and 81, and were defeated in the fourth-seed playoff the previous year.
