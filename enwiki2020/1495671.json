Founded in 1955, WRSD comprises Holden, Paxton, Princeton, Rutland, and Sterling. William Beando was appointed principal as of July 1, 2007, succeeding the one year interim service of longtime principal Hal Lane, who had retired in 1993. The assistant principals are Andrew Costa, Anthony DiBenedetto, Victoria DeSimone, and Michael Pratt. ==Academics== The school offers a wide range of courses in many subjects, chiefly of four difficulty levels. The CPA, College Prep - Accelerated, is the accelerated college preparatory level, and the majority of students take classes at this level. The Honors level is above CPA. CP, College Prep is the regular level for students and prepares them for studies after high school. Students at the CP level may need a little extra support with their studies to prepare them for post-high school studies. The fourth main class level is AP, or Advanced Placement, a College Board program through which college credit can be awarded for excellent performance on year-end standardized exams. There are also V or \"0\" level courses, which are usually mandatory or non-academic, such as physical education and special education courses. The Advanced Placement program at the school has proven a great success. Since 2005, 88% of students taking the end-of-year examination have earned a score of \"3\" or better, qualifying many of the students for college credit. As of 2010, the high school offers nineteen Advanced Placement courses. The high school also consistently exceeds state and national averages for the Scholastic Aptitude Test, or SAT. ==School activities== ===Music Department=== WRHS has a large and well regarded music department- which includes several choirs or varying sizes, orchestra and concert bands, string and wind ensembles, as well as jazz performance groups (both vocal and instrumental).

Winners of the school competition advance to the Regional Science Fair. In order to help students develop high quality projects and to stimulate their interest in science, Wachusett holds Science Seminar meetings every Tuesday night. Interested students take an entrance examination in order to be admitted to Science Seminar. For the first hour of these meetings, a scientist from the community speaks to seminar members about his/her work. The second hour consists of meetings between students and their science project advisors for help and guidance in the process. Many students have done well at the Regional Science Fair, State Science Fair, International Science and Engineering Fair, and other fairs. Science Seminar is presided over by Carol Sullivan, a longtime teacher at the school, as well as a variety of advisers who are current or retired scientists in the field. Every week a prominent figure in the field of science is brought in to give a one-hour lecture on their chosen subject (subjects range from forensic science to the latest solar panel technology to the size of the universe), and then students break into groups to meet with their adviser and discuss their year-long science project. ===Theater Arts=== The Theater Company at Wachusett performed in the MHSDG One Act Play festival under the direction of Doug Ingalls for over 10 years, before Ingalls' passing in 2009, after which the school's Black Box Theater was renamed the Doug Ingalls Black Box Theater in honor of its long standing director.

This was followed in 2004 with Tom Jones, in 2005 with Medea, in 2007 with For Whom The Southern Belle Tolls, and in 2008 with \"The Magdalene Laundries,\" an original play written by Mr. Ingalls.
