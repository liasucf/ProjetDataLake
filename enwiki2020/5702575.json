It was built in 1596 on a high plateau on the banks of the Mapusa River, a tributary of the Mandovi River. A flight of broad steps cut into a cliff lead to an open plain that surrounds the grand white building. Inside, the Church is ornately decorated with symbolic biblical murals and grand statues. The treasures of the church are the subject of a village legend. At one time, the statues of the church were strung with jewellery by villagers as thanks for prayers answered. However, it is said that the Churches were often robbed of these jewels. The Church buildings are white-washed in the tradition of Goan churches. The band stand in the grounds and the cemetery are also white-washed. The gate of the Church graveyard has a sign in Konkani which reads \"Aiz Maka, Falea Tuka\", prominently displayed at the entrance, which translates into something akin to 'Me Today, You Tomorrow' , a poignant reminder of our mortality. ==Prominent landmarks== upright=2.5 * Church of St Thomas * Aldona Cemetery * Aldona comunidade(s): The village community.
