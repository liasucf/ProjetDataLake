Her name was sometimes seen as Hedda Harrigan. ==Early years== Harrigan was the youngest of 10 children of entertainer Edward Harrigan and his wife, Annie Braham Harrigan. Her grandfather was conductor David Braham, and one of her brothers was actor William Harrigan As a child, she sometimes appeared on stage with her father.

She acted in stock theater companies, including the Woodward Players at the Majestic Theater in Detroit. Decades later, Harrigan reflected on the education that she gained from working in stock theater. \"There were no [acting] schools then,\" she said. \"But you see, there were a lot of stock companies. You learned an awful lot in stock. I played stock every year and learned by just doing.\" In 1984, Harrigan was production consultant for Harrigan and Hart, a stage show about the entertainment team formed by her father and Tony Hart. In 1985, she performed with her husband, Joshua Logan, in An Evening with Joshua Logan, a show that reviewed his career as a director. ==Film== In 1934, Harrigan left New York's stages and went to Hollywood to act in the Columbia Pictures film I'll Fix It. She returned to Hollywood to make The Case of the Caretaker's Cat (1936). Her other films included Thank You, Mr. Moto (1937) and Devil's Island (1939). == Public service == During World War II, Harrigan was a leading force in establishing the Stage Door Canteen, which produced plays for servicemen, and she led tours of plays to Europe to entertain troops. Harrigan also served as president of the Actors Fund, and was a founder of the Actors Fund Bloodbank and a trustee of the Museum of the City of New York. Harrigan's long-term service to the United Service Organizations led to her being awarded the USO's Woman of the Year award in the 1980s. ==Personal life== In 1921, Harrigan married actor Walter Connolly, with whom she had a daughter.
