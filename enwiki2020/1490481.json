    "text": "\"Why Does It Always Rain on Me?\" is a song by Scottish band Travis, released as the third single from their second studio album, The Man Who. The song became the group's international breakthrough single, receiving recognition around the world. It was their first top-ten hit on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at No. 10 in August 1999. The song also peaked within the top twenty in Australia and achieved moderate success in mainland Europe, North America, Ireland, and New Zealand. In a poll by listeners of Absolute Radio, the song was ranked 62nd on a list of the top 100 songs of the 1990s. ==Background== Fran Healy started writing the song while on holiday in Israel. According to Healy, he wanted to go somewhere sunny in the middle of winter because in his hometown of Glasgow, Scotland, it rained frequently. His accountant suggested the southern vacation city of Eilat, Israel which is known for its hot weather even during winter time. However, on the way to the hotel, it began to rain, which lasted until he left a week later. Healy said he wanted to write the song, and wrote the second verse starting with \"Why does it always rain on you? Is it because I picked you up in '92?\" but decided that it wasn't good and changed it. He said that that the line \"Is it because I lied when I was 17?\" refers to the time when he lied about his age to get a job behind the bar at the biggest club in Glasgow. The rest of the song was written six months later in Madrid at 1 o'clock in morning. He had just spoken to his manager on the phone who assured him that his career is taking off, but he felt things were not working for him, and wrote the lines \"I can't sleep tonight / Everybody's saying everything is alright\" and \"I can't stand myself\" which refers to him hating himself as well as not being able to stand up. \"I\u2019m being held up by invisible men\" refers to people in the music industry who propped him up as well as holding him up like robbers. He recorded the music and vocals in France. He sang the song 20 times, and the producer Mike Hedges then spliced the best parts of the song together. Hedges suggested a cello intro at a session in Abbey Road Studios, while Nigel Godrich gave the song the guitar sound. ==Live performances== When Travis began to perform this song at the 1999 Glastonbury Festival, after being sunny for several hours, it began to rain exactly when the first line was sung, and stopped at the end of the song. Their performance was a talking point of the festival, and their career took off afterwards. Their single was released a month after Glastonbury, and it reached No. 10 on the UK Singles Chart, and it also helped push the album The Man Who to No. 1. ==Music video== The music video was directed by John Hardwick and filmed in Cornwall, with scenes filmed on Bodmin Moor. The pool of water that Healy (actually a stuntman) jumps into is part of a disused mining quarry known locally as \"Gold Diggings\u201d in Craddock Moor which is on the edge of Bodmin Moor. The video features the band in a rain-soaked setting, with the band having locked frontman Healy, wearing a kilt, in the trunk of a 1970s Vauxhall Viva. Healy escapes, and chases the rest of the band into a disused mining quarry. The video continues with the band being shown in a floating living room, performing the song. The video ends with the living room floating away. It does not actually rain at any point during the video. The underwater scenes were filmed by underwater cinematographer Mark Silk, in the tank at Oceanic SW Limited, Honiton, Devon. (The company went into administration in January 2019). The director of photography of the video was Ben Davis with Derrin Schlesinger the producer. ==Track listings== UK CD1 # \"Why Does It Always Rain on Me?\" \u2013 4:27 # \"Village Man\" \u2013 3:18 # \"Driftwood\" (live at the Link Caf\u00e9, Glasgow) \u2013 4:07 UK CD2 # \"Why Does It Always Rain on Me?\" \u2013 4:27 # \"The Urge for Going\" \u2013 6:04 # \"Slide Show\" (live at the Link Caf\u00e9, Glasgow) \u2013 3:15 7-inch vinyl / cassette / European single # \"Why Does It Always Rain on Me?\" \u2013 4:27 # \"Village Man\" \u2013 3:18 American EP # \"Why Does It Always Rain on Me?\" \u2013 4:27 # \"Village Man\" - 3:18 # \"The Urge for Going\" \u2013 6:04 # \"Driftwood\" (live at the Link Caf\u00e9, Glasgow) \u2013 4:07 # \"Slide Show\" (live at the Link Caf\u00e9, Glasgow) \u2013 3:15 Australian single # \"Why Does It Always Rain on Me?\" \u2013 4:27 # \"Village Man\" \u2013 3:18 # \"Driftwood\" (live at the Link Caf\u00e9, Glasgow) \u2013 4:07 # \"Baby One More Time\" (live at the Bay Tavern, Robin Hood's Bay) \u2013 3:30 # \"Why Does It Always Rain on Me?\" (video) ==Charts and certifications== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1999\u20132000) !Peak position |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |39 |- |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Poland (LP3) |20 |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (2000) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA) |81 |} ===Certifications=== ==References== Category:1999 singles Category:1999 songs Category:Independiente (record label) singles Category:Rock ballads Category:Song recordings produced by Nigel Godrich Category:Songs about suicide Category:Songs written by Fran Healy (musician) Category:Travis (band) songs ",
