    "text": "Kenny Klein (1955-2020 (presumed)) was an American folk and country musician and a published author. He was an elder and high priest in the Blue Star tradition of Wicca. Klein was a fiddler, playing styles ranging from British folk to jazz and swing. He was convicted in April 2017 of 20 counts of possession of child pornography. On 13 July 2020 it was reported on a Neopagan website and in various places on social media that on Saturday, 11 July 2020, Klein died in prison of pancreatic cancer. ==Musical career== Born in New York City, Klein and his then-wife performed as a duo called Kenny and Tzipora in the mid-1980s, and they recorded several projects on Kicking Mule Records, including the album Wineskins, Tinkers, & Tears in 1985. Together with their children they traveled around the US, performing at pagan festivals, Renaissance fairs, and folk music venues. In 1992, Kenny and Tzipora divorced, and Kenny began his solo music career, subsequently releasing several projects on Blackthorn Records. In 1998 he released the CD Muses, an album of all original music produced by Brewers' Witch Productions. ==Neopagan activities== Through his interest in British folk music, Klein discovered the Wiccan and Neopagan communities. While living in New York City, he joined Tzipora Katz's Blue Star coven and tradition of Wicca; he married Katz, who initiated him as a high priest in that tradition in 1983. Between 1983 and 1992 Katz and Klein were largely responsible for transforming Blue Star from a local coven to a Wiccan tradition of its own. Touring the country during that period performing music, Kenny and Tzipora continued to teach Blue Star Wicca, initiating people and founding covens, and teaching largely via recording and distributing lessons on cassette tapes. He is the author of The Flowering Rod: Men, Sex and Spirituality, a book on Wicca and men's mysteries. ==Child pornography conviction== On March 25, 2014, agents of the Louisiana State Police Special Victims Unit executed a search warrant at Klein's residence and seized a computer that contained 20 videos showing minor children engaged in sexually explicit activities. On April 6, 2017, after a three-day jury trial, Klein was convicted of one count of pornography involving a juvenile under age 13, and 19 counts of possession with intent to distribute pornography involving juveniles under age 17. He was sentenced to twenty years in prison, fined $2,500 and ordered that, upon release, he wear an electronic ankle monitor for the rest of his life. ==Written works== *Fairy Tale Rituals (May 2011), Llewellyn Worldwide Snow White: Twice Upon a Time (April 2012) in American Film * Through The Faerie Glass (February 2010), Llewellyn Worldwide * The Flowering Rod: Men, Sex and Spirituality (March 1993), Delphi Press , * Lilith, Queen of the Desert (July 2010), includes the poem \"Lilith\" by Kenny Klein, Knickerbocker Circus Publishing, * Girls I Knew When I Was Twenty (August 2004), Poetic Diversity. * Legba in the French Market Strange Road Website ==Discography== ===Solo=== * 1994: Gold of the Autumn \u2013 Blackthorn Records * 1995: High Grows the Barley \u2013 Blackthorn Records * 1998: Muses \u2013 Brewers' Witch Productions * 2004: The Fairy Queen \u2013 Blackthorn Records * 2005: Little Birds Of Desire \u2013 Blackthorn Records * 2005: Barley Moon \u2013 Blackthorn Records * 2007: Meet Me in the Shade of the Maple Tree \u2013 Blackthorn Records * 2008: Oak & Ash \u2013 Blackthorn Records * 2011: Ghosts of the Delta \u2013 Independent * 2012: Black Cat Blues \u2013 Independent ===With Tzipora Katz=== * 1983: Worn Out Threads and Tire Treads (live album) \u2013 Kicking Mule Records * 1983: Moon Hooves in the Sand \u2013 Blue Star Records (cassette) * 1984: Songs of the Otherworld \u2013 Kenny & Tzipora (cassette) * 1985: Wineskins, Tinkers, & Tears \u2013 Kicking Mule Records (LP) * 1986: Dreamer's Web \u2013 Kenny & Tzipora (cassette) * 1988: Fairy Queen \u2013 Kenny & Tzipora (cassette) * 1989: Both Sides of the Water \u2013 Kenny & Tzipora (cassette) * 1990: Branches \u2013 Kenny & Tzipora \u2014 Magical Audio Graphics Incomplete (cassette) * 1990: Kenny & Tzipora: Live & Kickin' at A.C.E. \u2013 A.C.E.
