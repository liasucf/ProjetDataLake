Buff is ochreous-like colour.The Oxford English Dictionary (OED). Second Edition (20 Volume Set). Clarendon Press, 1989 As an RYB quaternary colour, it is the colour produced by an equal mix of the tertiary colours citron and russet.William J. Miskella, 1928, Practical Color Simplified: A Handbook on Lacquering, Enameling, Coloring And Painting; John Lemos, 1920, \"Color Charts for the School Room\", in School Arts, vol. 19, pp 580\u2013584 ==Etymology== The first recorded use of the word buff to describe a colour was in The London Gazette of 1686, describing a uniform to be \"...a Red Coat with a Buff- colour'd lining\". It referred to the colour of undyed buffalo leather, such as soldiers wore as some protection: an eyewitness to the death in the Battle of Edgehill (1642) of Sir Edmund Verney noted \"he would neither put on arms [armour] or buff coat the day of the battle\".Miriam Slater, Family Life in the Seventeenth Century: the Verneys of Claydon House 1984:11. Such buff leather was suitable for buffing or serving as a buffer between polished objects. It is not clear which bovine \"buffalo\" referred to, but it may not have been any of the animals called \"buffalo\" today. ===Derived terms=== The word buff meaning \"enthusiast\" or \"expert\" (US English) derives from the colour \"buff\", specifically from the buff-coloured uniform facings of 19th-century New York City volunteer firemen, who inspired partisan followers among particularly keen fire watchers.Robert W. Masters \"What is a Fire Buff?\", Pictorial History of Firefighting, revised edition, 1967; Steve Hanson, \"Fire buffs: who are they?\". \"In the buff\", today meaning naked, originally applied to English soldiers wearing the buff leather tunic that was their uniform until the 17th century. The \"naked\" signification is due to the perception that (English) skin is buff-coloured. == In nature == === Geology === Sand, rock, and loess tend to be buff in many areas.

Buff envelopes are used extensively in commercial mailings.

In the 17th century, the traditional colour of formal dress boot uppers was often described as \"buff\".

Bull's buff waistcoats, topcoats,\"AngloMania: Tradition and Transgression in British Fashion,\" Metropolitan Museum of Art (2006), exhibition brochure, p. 2. trousers and boot uppers were typical of 16th- and 17th-century Englishmen.

Buff has good camouflage qualities as sand, soil, and dry vegetation are buff in many areas. The term buff coat refers to a part of 17th-century European military uniforms. Such coats were intended to protect the wearer, and the strongest and finest leathers tend to be buff, so the term \"buff coats\" came to refer to all such coats, even if the colour varied.

The phrase \"Steady the Buffs!\", popularised by Rudyard Kipling in his 1888 work Soldiers Three, has its origins during 2nd Battalion's garrison duties in Malta. Adjutant Cotter, not wanting to be shown up in front of his former regiment, the 21st Royal (North British) Fusiliers, spurred his men on with the words: \"Steady, the Buffs! The Fusiliers are watching you.\" File:Soldier of 3rd regiment 1742.jpg|Soldier of The Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment) wearing \"a new Red Coat lin'd with a Buff colour'd lining, .... Breeches of the same colour as the Coat lining.\" ===U.S. Army=== The uniform of the American Continental Army was buff and blue. Buff is the traditional colour of the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps. The U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry specifies a \"buff\" tincture for certain coats of arms, often treating it as a metal for purposes of the rule of tincture.

Both General Washington and Alexander Hamilton, as chief of staff, had a role in the design of the uniforms. Other school colours described as \"buff and blue\" include Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C., and Punahou School in Honolulu, Hawaii. Buff is one of three colours of the Alpha Gamma Delta fraternity, and one of two colours of the Delta Chi fraternity.

File:Le_coup_de_maitre.jpg|Depiction of the Whig Charles James Fox wearing buff and blue ===White Star buff=== The funnels of the RMS Titanic and all other ships of the White Star Line were designated to be \"buff with a black top\" in order to indicate their ownership. There is some uncertainty among experts, however, as to the exact shade of what is now called \"White Star buff\". There is no surviving paint or formula, and although there are many painted postcards and at least seven colour photographs of White Star liners, the shades of the funnels in these varies due to many factors including the conditions under which they were originally made and the ageing of the pigments in which they were printed. Speaking mostly to scale modellers, the Titanic Research and Modelling Association currently recommend a colour \"in the range of the Marschall color\", meaning the colour in illustrations in a particular book.The TRMA recommend the colour on found on \"pp. 54, 60-61, and 67 of the new book Art of Titanic\", presumably Ken Marschall's Art of Titanic 978-0786864553. As a relatively inexpensive and readily available paint colour, and one which went well alongside the near-universal black hull and white superstructure used on steamships at the time, White Star was far from the only shipping line to use a shade of buff as a funnel colour. The Orient Line and Norddeutscher Lloyd used an entirely buff funnel without the black top, while Canadian Pacific and the Swedish American Line employed a buff funnel with a representation of the company's house flag on them. The Bibby Line and the Fyffes Line are two of several firms to use the same \"buff with a black top\" scheme as White Star, but with a similar lack of certainty as to the exact shade used and how this differed from the famous White Star scheme. File:Colorful Oceanic.jpg|Ships of the White Star Line, such as the RMS Oceanic pictured here, and the Titanic, had buff funnels with black tops. ===In Canadian heraldry=== As well as being a colour used by the United States Army Institute of Heraldry, buff is also recognised as a tincture by the Canadian Heraldic Authority. It appears on the heraldic badge and flag of the Correctional Service of Canada. ==See also== *List of colours *Beige, a similar colour *Fallow *Tan, a slightly darker, redder colour *Tawny ==References== Category:Quaternary colors Category:Shades of brown Category:Shades of yellow Category:Shades of orange Category:Colours (heraldry) Category:Metals (heraldry) hi:\u092d\u0942\u0930\u093e#\u092c\u093e\u0926\u093e\u092e\u0940 ",
