    "text": "A Tale of Three Cities () is a 2015 Chinese-Hong Kong war romance film directed by Mabel Cheung. The film is about the real love story of two people (Charles and Lee-Lee Chan, parents of Jackie Chan) who met in Wuhu during the Second Sino-Japanese War in the 1930s, separated in Shanghai during the Chinese Civil War in the 1940s, and finally reunited in Hong Kong in the 1950s while their children from previous marriages were left behind in mainland China (whom they would not see again until 38 years later). Jackie Chan reportedly \"cried and cried, until the end of the film\" when he watched the film by himself. ==Cast== * Sean Lau as Fang Daolong * Tang Wei as Chen Yuerong * Qin Hailu as Sister Qiu * Jing Boran as Shou Maihua * Huang Jue as Master Zhou * Elaine Jin as Yuerong's mother * Li Jianyi as grandfather * Jiao Gang * Philip Chan ==See also== *Traces of a Dragon, 2003 documentary film on Jackie Chan's parents, also directed by Cheung ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Hong Kong films Category:2015 films Category:Hong Kong war films Category:Hong Kong romance films Category:Hong Kong epic films Category:2010s war films Category:2010s romance films Category:Chinese war drama films Category:Chinese romance films Category:Chinese films Category:Films based on actual events Category:Films set in the 1940s Category:Films set in the 1930s Category:Films set in the 1950s Category:Heyi Pictures films ",
