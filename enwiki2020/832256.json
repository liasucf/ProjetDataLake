His reign was a time of disturbances and internal and external problems. The revolt of Velu Thampi (who as Dewan negotiated the formal alliance between Travancore and the British East India Company) occurred during his rule. His great- granddaughter was the wife of Visakham Thirunal. Two ranis were adopted during the reign of Dharma Raja. They were Bharani Thirunal Parvathi Bayi and Uthram Thirunal Umayamma Bayi as the sisters of Avittom Thirunal. These princesses were the daughters of Chathayam Nal Mahaprabha Amma. ==References== ;Bibliography * Category:1712 births Category:1810 deaths Category:Malayali people Category:18th-century Indian monarchs Category:Hindu monarchs Category:Maharajas of Travancore Category:19th-century Indian monarchs ",
