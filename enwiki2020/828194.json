    "text": "Johannes Liechtenauer (also Lichtnauer, Hans Lichtenawer) was a German fencing master who had a great level of influence on the German fencing tradition in the 14th century. == Biography == Massmann 1844). Liechtenauer seems to have been active during the mid-to-late 14th century.It has been speculated that he may still have been alive at the time of the compilation ms. 3227a, but this is based merely on the absence of a formula marking him as deceased. Tobler, Christian Henry. In Saint George's Name: An Anthology of Medieval German Fighting Arts. Wheaton, IL: Freelance Academy Press, 2010, p. 6 The only extant biographical note on Liechtenauer is found in GNM Hs. 3227a (dated c. 1400\"the GMN 3227a [contains] text passages and recipes [of the kind] that became common 10-20 years later than 1389. Looking at the content in comparison to other manuscripts a dating to 1410-1420 is more likely but this pure speculative.\" Jens P. Kleinau, 1418 Modus Dimicandi Magistri H. Beringois of the Ms. G.B.f.18.a (2013)), which states that \"Master Liechtenauer learnt and mastered [the art of the sword] in a thorough and rightful way, but he did not invent it or make it up himself, as it is stated before. Instead, he travelled across and visited many lands for the sake of this rightful and true art, as he wanted to study and know it.\"fol. 13v. und dy [kunst des swertes] hat meister lichtnawer gancz vertik und gerecht gehabt und gekunst / Nicht das her sy selber haben funden und irdocht als vor ist geschreben / Sonder her hat manche lant durchfaren und gesucht / durch der selben rechtvertigen und worhaftige kunstn wille / das her dy io ervaren und wissen wolde / \u017babi\u0144ski, Grzegorz. \"Unarmored Longsword Combat by Master Liechtenauer via Priest D\u00f6bringer.\" in Jeffrey Hull (ed.) Masters of Medieval and Renaissance Martial Arts, Paladin Press, 2008. His surname indicates he was from a place called Liechtenau (modern Lichtenau). There are several places with this name. Massmann (1844) mentions five candidate locations: Lichtenau im M\u00fchlkreis in Upper Austria; Lichtenau in Franconia, Nuremberg; Lichtenau on the Rhine, Baden, near Strasbourg; Lichtenau in Hesse; and Lichtenau in Westphalia, near Paderborn. Of these he treats as the most likely Franconian Lichtenau, because Nuremberg was a center of later (Renaissance-era) fencing, and Lichtenau in Upper Austria, because of the geographical provenance suggested by the members of the Society of Liechtenauer.Hans Ferdinand Massmann, \"\u00fcber handschriftliche Fechtb\u00fccher\", Serapeum: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Bibliothekwissenschaft, Handschriftenkunde, und \u00e4ltere Litteratur, ed. Robert Naumann, 1844, p. 52 and p. 54 note 2. == The Zettel (epitome) == Liechtenauer's students preserved his teaching in the form of a mnemonic poem (called the Zettel, Early New High German zedel, a German word corresponding to English schedule, in the sense of \"brief written summary\"; translated \"epitome\" by Tobler 2010). Later in the 15th century, parts of these verses become widely known, and by the 16th century are incorporated into the general tradition of German fencing. The term zedel is used in the manuscripts associated with the Society of Liechtenauer in the mid-15th century. Its earliest known use found in Cod. 44 A 8 (dated 1452, fol. 9v): :Alh\u00ffe hebt sich an dye zedel der Ritterlichen kunst des fechtens dye do geticht vnd gemacht hat Johans Liechtenawer der ain hocher maister In den k\u00fcnsten gewesen ist dem got genadig se\u00ff :\"Here begin the zedel of the knightly art of fencing, which were composed and made by Johannes Liechtenauer, who was a high master in the arts, and on whom God may have mercy.\" The Zettel were apparently intended as a list of mnemonic aids to help the student remember concepts he had been taught orally. They do not \"explain\" the technique in any detail. On the contrary, the verses are intentionally cryptic and are described as \"secret and hidden words\" by later masters, who assure us that their opaque wording was intended to prevent the uninitiated from discovering the techniques described therein. These verses were treated as the core of the art by Liechtenauer's followers, and the earliest fencing manuals of the Liechtenauer school, beginning with Hs. 3227a and followed by the treatises of Peter von Danzig zum Ingolstadt, Jud Lew, and Sigmund Schining ein Ringeck in the 15th century, are organized such that each couplet or quatrain is given first, followed by a gloss or detailed explanation of its intended meaning. The Zettel are organized as follows: * a general introduction to the art of fighting * a general introduction to fighting with the long sword (the sword held with both hands on the grip) * a division into seventeen parts or techniques (also known as Liechtenauer's \"17 chief pieces\" or Hauptst\u00fccke) of fighting with the long sword. The general introduction is ethical as well as practical and begins as follows: {| |- | style=\"padding:0 2em;\"| Jung Ritter lere / got lip haben / frawen io ere / So wechst dein ere / Uebe ritterschaft und lere / Kunst dy dich czyret / vnd in krigen sere hofiret / | style=\"padding:0 2em;\"| Young knight, learn to love God and honour women, so grows your honour; practice chivalry and learn art which adorns you and will glorify you in battle. |} Liechtenauer's seventeen \"chief pieces\" (Hauptst\u00fccke) are: *five \"master strikes\" or \"hidden strikes\": 1. Zornhau, 2. Krumphau, 3. Zwerchhau, 4. Schielhau, 5. Scheitelhau *6. the four guards (Huten or Leger), called \"plough\" (Pflug), \"ox\" (Ochs), vom tag and \"the fool\" (Alber). *a list of techniques: 7. Versetzen, 8. Nachreisen, 9. \u00dcberlaufen, 10. Absetzen, 11. Durchwechseln, 12. Zucken, 13. Durchlaufen (grappling), 14. Abschneiden, 15. H\u00e4ndedr\u00fccken 16. four H\u00e4ngen, 17. twenty-four Winden. Liechtenauer is also cited as the originator of similar teachings in other disciplines, including fighting on horseback armored dueling or Kampffechten and wrestling, besides fragmentary allusions to other material, such as fighting with the dagger, the messer and the small shield, in ms. 3227a. Liechtenauer's actual authorship of this material is however doubtful. It seems more likely that Liechtenauer's contribution is limited to the unarmoured fencing with the long sword, while other masters specialized in other disciplines; the verses on armoured and mounted combat are likely due to Andreas Liegnitzer, Martin Hundsfeld or Jud Lew, while the verses on wrestling are mostly attributed to Ott Jud.'' Jaquet, Daniel and Walczak, Bartlomiej, Liegnitzer, Hundsfeld or Lew? The question of authorship of popular Medieval fighting teachings, Acta periodica duellatorum. 2014, vol. 2, pp. 105-148\\. \"From the analysis and proposed stemmata it is clear, that the Liegnitzer/Hundsfeld attribution is confirmed by at least three independent sources \u2013 Glasgow, Kal, Danzig \u2013 while Hundsfeld/Lew can be reliably traced back to a single, now missing, manuscript, most likely authored or commissioned by Jud Lew. Therefore, until some new evidence emerges, it seems only prudent to consider the Liegnitzer/Hundsfeld attribution as the one made in the original proto-manuscript from which all other manuscripts were copied.\" (p. 121) In addition to the Zettel on mounted fencing, several treatises in the Liechtenauer tradition include a group of twenty-six \"figures\"\u2014single line abbreviations of select couplets and quatrains that seem to summarize them. A parallel set of teachings was recorded by Andre Paur\u00f1feyndt in 1516 called the \"Twelve Teachings for the Beginning Fencer\".,Paur\u00f1feyndt, Andre, et al. Ergrundung Ritterlicher Kunst der Fechterey. Hieronymus Vietor: Vienna, 1516. These teachings are also generally abbreviations of longer passages from the long sword Zettel, and are similarly repeated in many treatises throughout the 16th century. Thus, it may be that the figures are a mnemonic that represent the initial stage of mounted fencing instruction, and that the full verse was learned only afterward.Tobler, Christian Henry. In Saint George's Name: An Anthology of Medieval German Fighting Arts. Wheaton, IL: Freelance Academy Press, 2010. p 6 == Society of Liechtenauer == The Society of Liechtenauer (Geselschaft Liechtenauers) is a list of seventeen masters found in the introduction to the three oldest copies of Paulus Kal's fencing manual. It is unclear if this was ever a formal organization or what its nature might have been; however, it is commonly speculated that the list is a memorial to deceased students and associates of the grand master.Tobler, Christian Henry. In Saint George's Name: An Anthology of Medieval German Fighting Arts. Wheaton, IL: Freelance Academy Press, 2010. p 7. Of particular interest is the international nature of the list, including masters from present-day Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, and Poland, which parallels the statement in the MS 3227a that Liechtenauer himself traveled to many lands to learn the art. Several masters from this list are known to have written fencing treatises, but about half remain completely unknown. Paulus Kal lists the members of the Society as follows:Hans Ferdinand Massmann, \"\u00fcber handschriftliche Fechtb\u00fccher\", Serapeum: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Bibliothekwissenschaft, Handschriftenkunde, und \u00e4ltere Litteratur, ed.
