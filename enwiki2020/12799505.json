    "text": "GYRO is a computational plasma physics code developed and maintained at General Atomics. It solves the 5-D coupled gyrokinetic-Maxwell equations using a combination of finite difference, finite element and spectral methods. Given plasma equilibrium data, GYRO can determine the rate of turbulent transport of particles, momentum and energy. ==See also== *List of plasma (physics) articles ==External links== * GYRO Homepage at General Atomics Category:Computational physics Category:Physics software Category:Plasma physics Category:Tokamaks ",
