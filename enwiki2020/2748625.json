    "text": "Vehbi Ko\u00e7 (20 July 1901 - 25 February 1996) was a Turkish entrepreneur and philanthropist. He founded the Ko\u00e7 Group, one of Turkey\u2019s largest groups of companies. During his lifetime he came to be one of Turkey's wealthiest citizens. ==Early life== Vehbi Ko\u00e7 was born in 1901 in \u00c7orakal\u0131, a predominately Muslim neighborhood in Ankara. Vehbi Ko\u00e7 then lived in a vineyard estate located in the Ke\u00e7i\u00f6ren district near Ankara. Purchased by his father in 1923, the property, which was left vacant after the Kasapyan family left the, was later acquired by Ko\u00e7 and became the Vehbi Ko\u00e7 museum in 1944 after a thorough renovation. ==Career== Ko\u00e7 began his working career in 1917 at the small grocery store his father opened in Ankara for him. The first firm he established was \"Ko\u00e7zade Ahmet Vehbi\" and was registered in 1926 at the Ankara Chamber of Commerce. While dealing with commerce, he became the local representative of Ford Motor Company and Standard Oil (presently Mobil) in 1928. When Ankara became the capital of young Turkish Republic, construction activities increased and Vehbi Ko\u00e7 began trading in construction materials, building supplies and hardware. Following establishment of branch offices in Istanbul and Eski\u015fehir in 1938, Ko\u00e7 gathered its enterprises under the company Ko\u00e7 Ticaret A.\u015e. In 1942, Vehbi Ko\u00e7, who had not played any role in the Varlik Vergisi, saw the opportunities it afforded him as a businessman and took over many collapsed or confiscated companies. One such acquisition by Ko\u00e7 was a building in Istanbul owned by an Armenian named Margarios Ohanyan, who had sold the property worth 1.5-2 million liras through public auction at a price significantly below value, in the owner's attempt to avoid paying the tax- hike. Ko\u00e7, nevertheless, hired many of the former owners and treated them with fairness and without racial prejudice.E.P. Nowill: Constantinople and Istanbul: 72 Years of Life in Turkey. Troubador Publishing, 2011. p. 77 Having convinced General Electric, he signed an agreement in 1948 to build a light bulb factory, which opened in 1952. Ko\u00e7 took important steps in industry in the 1950s and manufactured automobiles, household appliances, radiators, electronic devices, textiles and matches. Factories like Bozkurt Mensucat, Ar\u00e7elik (1955), Demir Dokum (1954), Turkay, Aygaz (1962), Gazal, Turk Elektrik Endustrisi and a joint cable factory with Siemens were founded. In addition tractor production started under the Fiat license. The first initiative by Ko\u00e7 in the automotive sector turned eventually to a full-scale industry. Following an agreement with Ford Motor Company in 1959, today's prominent automotive company Ford Otosan came to life. Following the production of the first domestic mass-production car Anadol in 1966 and in line with improving economic activities in Turkey, Vehbi Ko\u00e7 collaborated with the Italian company FIAT to establish Tofa\u015f in 1968 resulting in the production of the second domestic car Murat in 1971. Vehbi Ko\u00e7 consolidated all of the companies bearing his name under the same roof in 1963 and founded Ko\u00e7 Holding A.\u015e. The holdings era in Turkey started with this step by Vehbi Ko\u00e7 and a great number of businessmen followed him. The group also has international partnerships with well-known companies such as Fiat, Ford Motor Co., Yamaha and Allianz. During his 76-year career, he created an immense organization with more than 108 companies in the Ko\u00e7 Group, all of which are specialized in different sectors such as food, retailing, finance, energy, automotives, tourism and technology. The Ko\u00e7 Group has 80,000 employees, ca.$40 billion turnover, $900 million of exports and $500\u2013600 million of investment annually. Today, it is one of the world's 200 largest enterprises. Ko\u00e7 retired in 1984 to devote more time to social activities. His son Rahmi took over the leadership of the Ko\u00e7 Group companies. ==Philanthropy== Vehbi Ko\u00e7 founded an Eye Bank at the Faculty of Medicine of Ankara University, a Cardiology Institute at the Faculty of Medicine of Istanbul University, the Turkish Education Foundation (T\u00fcrk E\u011fitim Vakf\u0131), and the Vehbi Ko\u00e7 Student Dorm at ODT\u00dc (METU). He established the Vehbi Ko\u00e7 Foundation on 17 January 1969 to promote activities in the fields of education, health and culture. Vehbi Ko\u00e7 donated the Atat\u00fcrk Library in Taksim, Istanbul to the Municipality of Istanbul in 1976 and in 1980 opened Turkey's first private museum, the Sadberk Hanim Museum in memory of his late wife, Sadberk. Ko\u00e7 was honorary chairman of Gen\u00e7lerbirli\u011fi S.K. in Ankara. Ko\u00e7 School opened in 1988, and Ko\u00e7 University opened its classroom doors in 1993. He also established the T\u00fcrkiye Aile Sa\u011fl\u0131\u011f\u0131 ve Planlamas\u0131 Vakf\u0131 (The Turkish Family Health and Planning Foundation) and functioned as the president of the foundation until his death. ==Death== Vehbi Ko\u00e7 died from heart failure on 25 February 1996 in a hotel in Antalya, where he was with his daughter Sevgi and son-in-law celebrating the Ramazan Bayrami holiday. His corpse was transported the same evening to Istanbul by a Ko\u00e7 Holding's business jet. On 27 February 1996, following a funeral service held at the holding's headquarter and later in Fatih Mosque, he was laid to rest at the Zincirlikuyu Cemetery. He was succeeded by his son Rahmi Ko\u00e7 (b. 1930), and his daughters Semahat Arsel (b. 1928), Sevgi G\u00f6n\u00fcl (1938\u20132003) and Suna K\u0131ra\u00e7 (b. 1941). ==Snatching of corpse== Grave of Vehbi Ko\u00e7 at Zincirlikuyu Cemetery, Istanbul On 24 October 1996, the corpse of Vehbi Ko\u00e7 was snatched from his grave. After some time, the body snatchers called the Ko\u00e7 family and demanded a ransom. As the family refused to pay, they applied to the TV channel Kanal D, owned by Ayd\u0131n Do\u011fan, demanding 20 billion TL (around US$210,000 at that time). Since Kanal D showed no interest, the body snatchers called the TV channel InterStar, owned then by Cem Uzan, and reached an agreement to release the corpse against 25 billion TL (around US$260,000). Informed by the TV channel, the police captured two suspects, who came to the meeting point in a stolen car. Later, three other accomplices, including a woman and a hotel owner, were also arrested. Vehbi Ko\u00e7's corpse was found in another grave at the same cemetery not far from his resting place. At the request of the public prosecutor, the remains were taken to the city forensic medicine laboratory for identification by DNA profiling. Finally, the remains were reinterred in the presence of the family members. ==Publications== * \"Hayat Hikayem\" (Story of My Life), 1973 (Turkish and English) * \"Hat\u0131ralar\u0131m, G\u00f6r\u00fc\u015flerim, \u00d6\u011f\u00fctlerim\" (My Memories, Visions, Advices), 1987 (Turkish and English) ==Quotes== In \"Targets and Principles\", a document published for employees working in his companies, he states, \"My constitutional law is this: I exist if my country and my state exists.

As our economy strengthens, democracy will take a stronger hold and our credibility in the world will increase\". ==References== ==External links== * Personal website Category:1901 births Category:1996 deaths Category:People from Ankara Category:Turkish businesspeople Category:Turkish philanthropists Category:Burials at Zincirlikuyu Cemetery Vehbi Category:Turkish billionaires Category:Museum founders Category:Disease-related deaths in Turkey Category:20th-century philanthropists Category:20th-century businesspeople ",
