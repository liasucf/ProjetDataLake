    "text": "Synydyne is an artist collective formed in 2006 that is responsible for several memetic Weird Twitter, performance art, and alternate reality game projects. Synydyne is led by Internet artists Thomas Bender and Jacob Bakkila. Synydyne's projects include Horse_ebooks, Bear Stearns Bravo, Pronunciation Book, and This is My Milwaukee. In a 2015 interview, Bakkila explained the collective's approach: \"Most of what Synydyne has created thus far is either designed to spread as quickly as possible \u2014 @Horse_ebooks and Pronunciation Book being the obvious examples \u2014 or to be as difficult as possible to access.\" == References == == External links == * http://www.synydyne.com Category:Weird Twitter Category:New media artists Category:Internet memes ",
