The plot follows an upper-class French couple, Georges (Auteuil) and Anne (Binoche), who are terrorised by anonymous tapes that appear on their front porch and seem to show the family is under surveillance. Shot in Paris and Vienna in 2004, the film is a co-production of France, Austria, Germany and Italy. The French government's decades-long denial of the 1961 Seine River massacre was an inspiration to the story. Cach\u00e9 competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival, where polled critics and festival audiences considered it a frontrunner. Ultimately, the jury awarded Haneke Best Director. At the European Film Awards, it competed with the Cannes Palme d'Or winner, L'Enfant by the Dardenne brothers, with Cach\u00e9 winning five awards, including Best Film. The film was submitted as Austria's entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 78th Academy Awards, but was disqualified as French is not predominantly the language of Austria. As Haneke is Austrian, it would have also been disqualified if France or any other country had submitted it. The exclusion sparked criticism, with Sony Pictures Classics co-president Michael Barker calling it \"unfortunate\" and saying the story demanded the film be in French. Austria's Fachverband der Audiovisions und Filmindustrie protested the criteria, and Haneke, whose previous French-language The Piano Teacher was not disqualified as the Austrian submission, also called the rules \"really stupid\". Academy member Mark Johnson responded, \"We're in the process right now of considering some very radical changes\". ==Accolades== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Award ! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony ! scope=\"col\"| Category ! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- !scope=\"row\" | Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences of Argentina | December 2006 | Best Foreign Film | rowspan=\"8\" | Michael Haneke | | |- !scope=\"row\" | Bodil Awards | 25 February 2007 | Best Non-American Film | | |- !scope=\"row\" | British Independent Film Awards | 29 November 2006 | Best Foreign Independent Film | | |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=3| Cannes Film Festival | rowspan=\"3\" | 11 \u2013 22 May 2005 | Best Director | | rowspan=\"3\" | |- | FIPRESCI Prize | |- | Prize of the Ecumenical Jury | |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=4| C\u00e9sar Awards | rowspan=\"4\"| 25 February 2006 | Best Director | | rowspan=\"4\" | |- | Best Original Screenplay | |- | Best Supporting Actor | Maurice B\u00e9nichou | |- | Most Promising Actor | Walid Afkir | |- !scope=\"row\" | Chicago Film Critics Association | 9 January 2006 | Best Foreign Language Film | rowspan=\"9\"| Michael Haneke | | |- !scope=\"row\" | Critics' Choice Awards | 9 January 2006 | Best Foreign Language Film | | |- !scope=\"row\" | David di Donatello | 2006 | Best European Film | | |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=2| Diagonale | rowspan=\"2\" | March 2005 | Best Director | | rowspan=\"2\" | |- | FIPRESCI Prize | |- !scope=\"row\" | Empire Awards | 27 March 2007 | Best Thriller | | |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=8| European Film Awards | rowspan=\"8\"| 3 December 2005 | Best Film | | rowspan=\"8\"| |- | Best Director | |- | Best Screenwriter | |- | Best Actor | Daniel Auteuil | |- | Best Actress | Juliette Binoche | |- | Best Editor | Michael Hudecek and Nadine Muse | |- | Best Cinematographer | Christian Berger | |- | FIPRESCI Prize | rowspan=\"4\"| Michael Haneke | |- !scope=\"row\" | Film Critics Circle of Australia | 2006 | Best Foreign Language Film | | |- !scope=\"row\" | Gopo Awards | 2007 | Best European Film | | |- !scope=\"row\" | Guldbagge Awards | 30 January 2006 | Best Foreign Film | | |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=2| London Film Critics Circle | rowspan=\"2\" | 8 February 2006 | Actress of the Year | Juliette Binoche | | rowspan=\"2\" | |- | Foreign Language Film of the Year | rowspan=\"3\"| Michael Haneke | |- !scope=\"row\" | Los Angeles Film Critics Association | 10 December 2005 | Best Foreign Language Film | | |- !scope=\"row\" | Lumi\u00e8res Awards | rowspan=\"1\" | 21 February 2006 | Best Screenplay | | rowspan=\"1\" | |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=2| Nastro d'Argento | rowspan=\"2\" | 2006 | Best Female Dubbing | Alessandra Korompay | | rowspan=\"2\" | |- | Best Foreign Director | rowspan=\"9\"| Michael Haneke | |- !scope=\"row\" | National Society of Film Critics | 8 January 2006 | Best Foreign Language Film | | |- !scope=\"row\" | New York Film Critics Circle | 8 January 2006 | Best Foreign Language Film | | |- !scope=\"row\" | Online Film Critics Society | 16 January 2006 | Best Foreign Language Film | | |- !scope=\"row\" | San Francisco Film Critics Circle | 12 December 2005 | Best Foreign Language Film | | |- !scope=\"row\" | Valladolid International Film Festival | October 2006 | 50th Anniversary Prize | | |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=3| Village Voice Film Poll | rowspan=\"3\"| 2006 | Best Film | | |- | Best Director | | |- | Best Screenplay | | |- |} ==References== == External links == * Category:Lists of accolades by film ",
