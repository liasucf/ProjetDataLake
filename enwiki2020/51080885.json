    "text": "Season 2013\u201314 was the 130th football season in which Dumbarton competed at a Scottish national level, entering the Scottish Football League for the 108th time, the Scottish Cup for the 119th time, the Scottish League Cup for the 67th time and the Scottish Challenge Cup for the 23rd time. == Overview == The 2013\u201314 season was Dumbarton's second consecutive season in the second tier of Scottish football - the Scottish Championship, having been promoted from the Scottish Second Division at the end of the 2011\u201312 season. Following Ian Murray's appointment which brought about an amazing transformation in Dumbarton's fortunes the previous season, it would be more of the same as far as this season was concerned. Indeed, at one point there was a chance that Dumbarton would challenge for a play-off place for the Premier Division. As it was, in the end, a very creditable 5th place was achieved. In the Scottish Cup, there was more good news as Dumbarton would have their best cup run in almost 40 years, and would only lose out to Premier Division Aberdeen by the only goal after a tight fought match. In the League Cup, after disposing of Albion Rovers in the first round, it would be Premier Division Dundee United that would advance, but only after a close match was lost by the odd goal in five. Finally, despite the other successes, it was no real surprise that the League Challenge Cup saw yet another first round exit, this time to Stranraer. Locally, in the Stirlingshire Cup, Falkirk would be the victors over Dumbarton in the semi final tie. ==Results & fixtures== ===Pre season=== ===SPFL Championship=== ===Ramsden Cup=== ===Scottish League Cup=== ===Scottish Cup=== ===Stirlingshire Cup=== ==Player statistics== |} ==Transfers== === Players in === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;width:98%; text-align:left\" |- !Player !From !Fee |- | Scott Smith | Hibernian | Free |- | Paul McGinn | St Mirren | Free |- | Scott Linton | Cowdenbeath | Free |- | Mitchel Megginson | Aberdeen | Free |- | Kevin Smith | Queen of the South |Free |- | Aaron Barry | Sheffield United |Loan |- | Jordan Kirkpatrick | Airdrie |Free |- | Colin Nish | Hartlepool United |Free |- | Hugh Murray | Partick Thistle |Free |- | Chris Kane | St Johnstone |Loan |- | Mark McLaughlin | Morton |Free |- | Michael Miller | Celtic |Loan |} === Players out === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font- size:95%;width:98%; text-align:left\" |- !Player !To !Fee |- | Gary McKell | Free Agent | Free |- | Robbie Winters | Free Agent | Free |- | James Creaney | Free Agent | Free |- | Mark Lamont | Free Agent | Free |- | Ryan Metcalfe | Free Agent | Free |- | Reese Pearson | Free Agent | Free |- | Ross Forsyth | Free Agent | Free |- | Phil Johnston | Free Agent | Free |- | Marc McCusker | Free Agent | Free |- | Jamie Lyden | Free Agent | Free |- | Kevin Nicoll | Free Agent | Free |- | Glenn Thomson | Free Agent | Free |- | Owen Ronald | Berwick Rangers |Loan |- | Martin McNiff | Annan Athletic |Loan |- | Josh Horne | Free Agent | Free |- | Joe Coleman | Kilbirnie Ladeside |Loan |- | Martin McNiff | Free Agent | Free |- | Kevin Smith | Free Agent | Free |- | Jim Lister | Airdrie | Free |- | Alan Lithgow | Ayr United | Free |- | Jason Marr | Free Agent | Free |} ==Trivia== * The League match against Queen of the South on 7 December marked Bryan Prunty's 100th appearance for Dumbarton in all national competitions - the 134th Dumbarton player to reach this milestone. * The League match against Hamilton on 1 February marked Scott Agnew's 100th appearance for Dumbarton in all national competitions - the 135th Dumbarton player to reach this milestone. ==See also== * 2013\u201314 in Scottish football ==References== ==External links== *Alistair McKerracher (Dumbarton Football Club Historical Archive) *Scottish Football Historical Archive Category:Dumbarton F.C. seasons Category:Scottish football clubs 2013\u201314 season ",
