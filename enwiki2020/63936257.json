    "text": "Scott Johnson was an American PhD student in mathematics who was killed in Australia in 1988. Initially treated by police as a suicide, a coroner's inquest in 2017 resulted in a finding he \"\u2026 died as a result of a gay-hate attack\". In May 2020, a man was arrested and charged with the murder of Johnson. ==Background== Johnson was a mathematics student at the University of Cambridge and was close to completing his PhD at the time of his death. Johnson, who was gay, had moved to Australia to be with his partner in 1986. ==Death== Johnson's body was found at the foot of cliffs at North Head near Manly, New South Wales, on 10 December 1988. Police initially claimed that his death was a case of suicide, which his brother, Steve Johnson, disputed. ==Aftermath== Steve Johnson campaigned for decades for his brother's death to be re-investigated. Family campaigning had led to coroners investigations in 2012 and 2015 that recommended that police reopen the case. No action was taken until 2017 when a coroner found that Johnson had died as a result of a hate crime. Police offered an A$1million reward in 2018 for information. His family raised the reward to A$2million in March 2020. The conclusion that Johnson's death was the result of a hate crime drew attention to other homophobic killings around Sydney beaches in the 1980s. It is now estimated that as many as 80 gay men were murdered in Sydney in the late 1980s, many pushed off cliffs. The New South Wales Police Force has since apologised for not investigating the murder of Johnson properly and failing to protect the gay community. ==2020 arrest== On 12 May 2020, a 49-year-old man was arrested ln Lane Cove and charged with the murder of Johnson. After being contacted about the arrest, Steve Johnson said: \"This is a very emotional day, he was my best friend and he really needed me to do this.\" Steve Johnson also hopes that the arrest will open the doors for others to receive justice. He said, \"I hope the family and friends of the other dozens of gay men who lost their lives find solace in what's happened today\". ==References== Category:1988 deaths Category:American people murdered abroad Category:Gay academics Category:Male murder victims Category:1980s murders in Australia Category:1988 crimes in Australia Category:Violence against LGBT people ",
