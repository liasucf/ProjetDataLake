    "text": "Paser I was the Viceroy of Kush during the reigns of Ay and likely Horemheb. Reisner mentions that the only datable inscriptions for Paser belong to the reign of Ay. The next known Viceroy however is Amenemopet, who is dated to the reign of Seti I. Hence it's possible that Paser I served during the reigns of Ay, Horemheb (and maybe even Ramesses I?).The Viceroys of Ethiopia by George A. Reisner The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, Vol. 6, No. 1. (Jan., 1920), pp. 38-39. Paser was the son of the Viceroy Amenhotep called Huy, who served during the reign of Tutankhamun. His mother was the Lady Taemwadsji.Porter, B. and Moss R.L.B., Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Reliefs and Paintings: The Theban Necropolis, Part One: Private Tombs.

Paser I is attested in: * Gebel es-Shems, a stela of Paser records his name and titles and a small chamber (\"petit speos\") is dedicated to Paser. The stela is dated to the reign of Ay. * Sehel, an inscription mentioning Paser. * The road from Assuan to Philae, an inscription of his son Amenemopet mentions Paser. * A lintel from the temple of Aniba shows Paser adoring the cartouches of Horemheb.PM VII, 81G.
