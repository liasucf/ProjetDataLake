It is one of the newest residential quarters of the city, it is situated at the foothills of the Little Carpathians overlooking the river Danube, offering extensive views over Bratislava and Austria. Buildings in this part of the city are almost exclusively blocks of flats, although most of them relatively new. Formerly consisting of vineyards, woods and meadows next to Karlova Ves proper, during the 1980s and 1990s a residential planned for 12,000 people emerged, that today houses almost 30,000 inhabitants. == History == The territory was previously a park/wood near Karlova Ves proper. The park was known as Langetheile before 1950 and as Dlh\u00fd diel from 1950 to 1976; both Langetheile (German) and Dlh\u00e9 diely (Slovak) literally mean \"long parts\" or \"long divisions\". The southern slopes of Dlh\u00e9 diely were inhabited from the Paleolithic age, as evidenced by archaeological finds of tools. Dlh\u00e9 diely is one of the more attractive quarters in Bratislava for housing, though recently big problems with traffic have been emerging because of large number of people living there (and more coming). == Gallery == == See also == * Karlova Ves * History of Bratislava == References == == External links == * Homepage of Karlova Ves * Dlh\u00e9 Diely Photos Category:Boroughs of Bratislava ",
