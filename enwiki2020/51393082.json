    "text": "1990\u20131993 is the discography compilation consisting of the entire recorded output of American powerviolence band Crossed Out, which was released in 1999 through Slap-a-Ham Records on compact disc and vinyl formats. The compilation includes previously released EP material as well as rare demos and live recordings. A limited edition of white-colored LP copies were released through direct mail order. ==Background== Crossed Out formed in late 1990 by guitarist Scot Golia, drummer Tad Miller, bassist Rich Hart, and vocalist Dallas Van Kempen. The group issued a demo tape, a self-titled 7\", a split 7\" with Man Is the Bastard, and a split 5\" with Dropdead. The group also contributed two tracks to the Slap-a-Ham compilation 7\" Son of Blleeaauurrggh, which also featured other prominent powerviolence and grindcore acts. The group would eventually break-up in 1993 after playing only 16 live shows total in the southern California area. The last five shows featured Eric Wood (from Man Is the Bastard) on the bass, for their original bassist Hart left the group by that point. One of these last few shows, which was recorded on August 21, 1993 at the Ch\u00e9 Caf\u00e9, is featured as the last four tracks on the 1990\u20131993 compilation. ==Track list== ==Personnel== *Rich Hart - bass (tracks 1\u201343) *Eric Wood - bass (tracks 44\u201347) *Tad Miller - drums *Scot Golia - guitar *Dallas Van Kempen - vocals *Alan Vangundy - recording (tracks 1\u20137) ==References== Category:1999 compilation albums Category:Crossed Out albums ",
