    "text": "Dato' Sri Richard Riot anak Jaem (born 1 December 1951) is a Malaysian politician. He is the incumbent seven-term Member of Parliament (MP) of Malaysia for Serian constituency in the state of Sarawak. He is appointed as Malaysia's special envoy to East Asia covering Japan, South Korea and Taiwan by Prime Minister of the federal ruling Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition, Muhyiddin Yassin in May 2020. Riot was previously the Minister of Human Resources of Malaysia in former Prime Minister Najib Razak's cabinet. He has also served as chairman of the Sarawak Rivers Board (SRB). He is a member and deputy president of the Sarawak United People's Party (SUPP); a component of Sarawak Parties Alliance (GPS). == Political career == === Party posts === During SUPP's triennial assembly in 2011, Riot was elected as the party's first non-Chinese deputy president. === Parliamentary career === Riot first contested and won the Serian parliamentary seat in 1990 as an independent candidate. He was later re-elected for six consecutive terms beginning in 1995, all on a National Front (BN) ticket. === Ministerial career === After serving for more than 20 years as a government backbencher, Riot was appointed as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs in a minor cabinet reshuffle on 1 June 2010. In 2013 he was promoted to a full ministerial position as Minister for Human Resources. == Controversy == After the 12th Malaysian general election in March 2008, there was speculation that Riot would defect to the opposition People's Justice Party (PKR); however, Riot denied the speculation and the move did not materialised. In September 2017, Riot was engulfed in a corruption allegation after 40 million was found to be missing from the Skills Development Fund Corporation (SDFC) under the Ministry of Human Resources which he helmed as its minister. Among those arrested by the Malaysian Anti- Corruption Commission (MACC) included his political secretary. Riot himself was called in by the MACC and questioned for 10 hours. Following the historic 14th Malaysian general election in May 2018 which saw the fall of the BN coalition from power, rumours swirled around with speculation that Riot was looking to, yet again, join the PKR, which was now a component party of the ruling Alliance of Hope (PH) coalition. This was denied by PKR Sarawak state liaison committee chairperson Baru Bian. Moreover, PH Sarawak chairperson, Chong Chieng Jen, advised his allied parties against accepting Riot in a statement declaring that his own, the Democratic Action Party (DAP), will not. Less than a year later in February 2019, Riot was again surrounded by speculation that he may jump ship, this time to the United Sarawak Party (PSB) which is a splinter party of the SUPP. On 29 February during the 2020 Malaysian political crisis, Riot was reported to has left SUPP to join PKR again. Somehow the inaccurate rumour was quickly quashed after a video clip of him denying the claims has gone viral the next day. == Election results == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\" |+ Parliament of Malaysia Percentage figures based on total turnout (including votes for other candidates not listed). !|Year !|Constituency !colspan=2| !|Votes !|Pct !colspan=2|Opponent(s) !|Votes !|Pct !|Ballots cast !|Majority !|Turnout |- |1990 |rowspan=\"13\" |Serian | | | (IND) |align=\"right\" |10,349 |align=\"right\" |57.45% | | |William Aham |align=\"right\" |7,664 |align=\"right\" |42.55% |align=\"right\" |18,516 |align=\"right\" |2,685 |align=\"right\" |66.93% |- |rowspan=\"4\" |1995 |rowspan=\"4\" | |rowspan=\"4\" | (SUPP) |rowspan=\"4\" align=\"right\" |12,116 |rowspan=\"4\" align=\"right\" |60.26% | | |Marcellus Munjan (IND) |align=\"right\" |4,562 |align=\"right\" |22.69% |rowspan=\"4\" align=\"right\" |20,690 |rowspan=\"4\" align=\"right\" |7,554 |rowspan=\"4\" align=\"right\" |65.40% |- | | |Michael Runin (PBS) |align=\"right\" |1,753 |align=\"right\" |8.72% |- | | |Andrew Nyabe (IND) |align=\"right\" |959 |align=\"right\" |4.77% |- | | |Betram Sading Jihok (IND) |align=\"right\" |716 |align=\"right\" |3.56% |- |rowspan=\"2\" |1999 |rowspan=\"2\" | |rowspan=\"2\" | (SUPP) |rowspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |12,491 |rowspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |71.77% | | |Anthony Polycarp Munjan (STAR) |align=\"right\" |4,040 |align=\"right\" |23.21% |rowspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |17,974 |rowspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |8,451 |rowspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |59.76% |- | | |Shamsuddin Abdullah @ Pok Ungkut (IND) |align=\"right\" |872 |align=\"right\" |5.01% |- |2004 | | | (SUPP) |align=\"right\" |13,960 |align=\"right\" |76.60% | | |Henry Ginai Langgie (IND) |align=\"right\" |4,265 |align=\"right\" |23.40% |align=\"right\" |18,686 |align=\"right\" |9,695 |align=\"right\" |59.13% |- |2008 | | | (SUPP) |align=\"right\" |15,793 |align=\"right\" |86.97% | | |Belayong Jayang (SNAP) |align=\"right\" |2,366 |align=\"right\" |13.03% |align=\"right\" |18,516 |align=\"right\" |13,427 |align=\"right\" |66.36% |- |rowspan=\"2\" |2013 |rowspan=\"2\" | |rowspan=\"2\" | (SUPP) |rowspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |19,494 |rowspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |74.33% | | |Edward Andrew Luak (DAP) |align=\"right\" |6,343 |align=\"right\" |24.19% |rowspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |26,562 |rowspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |13,151 |rowspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |78.79% |- | | |Johnny Bob Aput (STAR) |align=\"right\" |390 |align=\"right\" |1.49% |- |rowspan=\"2\" |2018 |rowspan=\"2\" | |rowspan=\"2\" | (SUPP) |rowspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |17,545 |rowspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |63.99% | | |Edward Andrew Luak (DAP) |align=\"right\" |7,640 |align=\"right\" |27.86% |rowspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |27,880 |rowspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |9,905 |rowspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |74.09% |- | | |Senior William Rade (IND) |align=\"right\" |2,234 |align=\"right\" |8.15% |} == Honours == * : ** 50px Officer of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (KMN) (1997) ** 50px Commander of the Order of Meritorious Service (PJN) - Datuk (2005) * : ** 50px Grand Knight of the Order of Sultan Ahmad Shah of Pahang (SSAP) - Dato' Sri (2013) * : ** 50px Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of Sarawak (PNBS) - Dato Sri (2017) == See also == * Serian (federal constituency) == References == Category:Living people Category:1951 births Category:People from Sarawak Category:Bidayuh people Category:Malaysian Christians Category:Malaysian Roman Catholics Category:Sarawak United Peoples' Party politicians Category:Independent politicians in Malaysia Category:Members of the Dewan Rakyat Category:Government ministers of Malaysia Category:Commanders of the Order of Meritorious Service Category:Knights Commander of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of Sarawak Category:Officers of the Order of the Defender of the Realm Category:20th-century Malaysian politicians Category:21st-century Malaysian politicians ",
