Accessed 28/12/13 ===Background=== Following the success of the album in the United Kingdom, Barlow signed a record deal with Arista records for the album to be released in America. He reworked the album for the American market and subsequently released a remixed version of \"So Help Me Girl\" as the lead single there. Billboard gave the American version a positive review, saying that it did not stray from Barlow's work in the group Take That. He also praised Barlow's \"boyish teen-idol charm\" and \"flexible tenor.\" ===Music video=== Two music videos were released for So Help Me Girl. The first video, accompanying the European release of the single, features Barlow taking a girl home after a night out, and waking up the next morning and realising that he has cheated on his girlfriend. He performs the majority of the song in the bedroom, before moving to a piano for the final scenes, which depict a fight between his girlfriend and the girl he took home. The second video, accompanying the American release of the single, begins with Barlow sitting alone on a bridge and throwing a rose into the water below, whilst a mysterious woman looks on. He then continues to perform the song whilst looking through the windows of a darkened house, where he spots a young girl. The video continues with Barlow walking through a lighted tunnel of moving cars, before returning to the house and performing the final line of the song to the girl personally.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSoJ5uR1rqU Official Music Video of So Help Me Girl ===Track listings=== ; UK CD1 # \"So Help Me Girl\" (4:28) # \"Million To One\" (3:25) # \"Offer My Peace\" (3:56) # \"So Help Me Girl\" (C Swing Mix) (4:30) ; UK CD2 # \"So Help Me Girl\" (4:28) # \"So Help Me Girl\" (Peter Mokran Mix) (4:38) # \"Interview\" (11:35) ; Cassette / 7\" Jukebox Vinyl # \"So Help Me Girl\" (4:28) # \"Million To One\" (3:25) ; American Single # \"So Help Me Girl\" (US Edit) (4:38) # \"Back For Good\" (Live) (4:01) ===Chart performance=== The single achieved relative success through Europe, and peaked at number 11 on the UK Singles Chart.
