    "text": "Scytinopogon is a genus of several species of clavarioid (coral-like) fungi in the family Clavariaceae. The genus, circumscribed by mycologist Rolf Singer in 1945, contains species with flattened branches and spores that are echinulate (covered with small spines) or verrucose (warty), and angular. The type species, S. pallescens, was originally described by Giacomo Bresadola in 1899 as a species of Pterula. Although traditionally classified in the family Clavariaceae based on morphology, molecular phylogenetic analysis suggests that Scytinopogon clusters within the genus Trechispora (order Trechisporales). ==See also== *List of Agaricales genera ==References== ==External links== * Category:Clavariaceae Category:Agaricales genera Category:Taxa named by Rolf Singer ",
