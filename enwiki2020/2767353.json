Rosalind Moss operated the Griffith Institute from its opening until the mid 1960s. The Griffith Institute Archive is home to an important and unique set of Egyptology resources. Built upon Griffith's original collection of manuscripts and excavation records, it contains and preserves early copies of inscriptions, drawings, watercolours, old negatives, photographs, squeezes, and rubbings. Among some seventy major groups of material the Institute holds the papers of Sir Alan H. Gardiner, Battiscombe Gunn and Jaroslav \u010cern\u00fd, records made by Howard Carter during his discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922, as well as the documentation from the Nubian expeditions of Griffith and Sir Henry Wellcome. The Institute edits and publishes two major research projects, the Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Reliefs and Paintings, and the Online Egyptological Bibliography (OEB). It is also responsible for a number of important publications within the field of Egyptology, the best-known being Gardiner's Egyptian Grammar and Faulkner's A Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian. Finally, the Griffith Institute administers the A.H. Gardiner Travel Scholarship in Egyptology, the aim of which is to promote friendship and cooperation between Egyptologists from the United Kingdom and the Arab Republic of Egypt. An exhibition at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, Discovering Tutankhamun, open from July until November 2014, explored Howard Carter\u2019s excavation of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922.
