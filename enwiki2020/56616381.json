She was launched in 1789 and served in the Armada Real for 11 years before being abandoned as a wreck in Manila Harbor in 1801.Aguado 1999, p. 321 == History == Europa was laid down at the Reales Astilleros de Esteiro shipyards in Ferrol, Spain in 1789. She was designed by Spanish naval architect Jos\u00e9 Romero y Fern\u00e1ndez de Landa as a third-rate, two decked seventy-four gun ship of the line. Following her completion, Europa joined the Spanish European Fleet. After several years of service, Europa was reassigned to service in the Pacific, and so she departed Spain for Concepcion, Chile, arriving in February 1796. She departed Concepcion for Manila in the Spanish Philippines on 10 October 1796 accompanied by her fellow third-rates Monta\u00f1es and San Pedro along with two 34-gun frigates, Pilar and Fama.Aguado 1999, p. 320 === Pacific service === Following her arrival in Manila, Europa her squadron operated out of the port city during the French Revolutionary Wars and the concurrent Anglo-Spanish War.Parkinson 1954, p. 136 In April 1797 the ships of the squadron were badly damaged by a typhoon, forcing the Spanish to dock and de-mast the ships for extensive repairs at Cavite.Parkinson 1954, p. 139. A British force under the command of Edward Cooke raided Manila in January 1798, and found Europa to be one of the Spanish ships undergoing repairs there. In January 1799 Europa, Monta\u00f1es, and two Spanish frigates departed Manila under the command of Ignacio Maria de \u00c1lava y S\u00e1enz de Navarrete. de Navarrete sailed the fleet to Southern China, where he intended to intercept Britain's annual - and extremely valuable - convoy of merchants returning to Europe from Canton. The Spanish ships arrived at the mouth of the Pearl River near Macau in late January, where they were joined by two french frigates. On 27 January the allied fleet fought an inconclusive engagement against a force of British warships sent to escort the convoy.Parkinson 1954, p. 157. During the battle, the larger Europa attempted to pursue the lighter HMS Intrepid, but damage to Monta\u00f1es forced de Navarrete to break off his attack and order a withdraw to Manila. Europa and Fama were again sent to Macau in May 1799, but failed to intercept any British ships. After her return to Manila, Europa fell into disrepair and was no longer fit for service. By 1801, she was reportedly a rotting wreck in Manila harbor. == References == * Parkinson, C. Northcote (1954). War in the Eastern Seas, 1793 \u2013 1815.
