Called Asthianene by the Greeks and Romans, it consisted of what is now the Bing\u00f6l plain, near the sources of the Tigris. The district of Khordzean (Greco-Roman Chorzene or Chorzanene), centered on Ki\u011fi (Armenian Kogoberd), was generally politically subordinate to Hashteank. Hashteank was primarily a rural district, with larger towns at Bing\u00f6l and Gen\u00e7. == History == In 387, along with that of Balahovit the principality of Hashteank became a Byzantine vassal, extending the Byzantine sphere of influence eastward, with the new border with the Sasanian Empire being the hills east of the Bing\u00f6l plain. In either 528 or 529, the military administration of Byzantine Armenia was reorganized. Under the new system, the fortress of Kitharizon (modern Bing\u00f6l) in Hashteank became the seat of one of the two \"dukes\" of Byzantine Armenia, with the other ruling from Martyropolis (Silvan in Sophene (both were subordinate to the magister militum ruling in Theodosiopolis, modern Erzurum). == References == Category:SopheneCategory:Early medieval Armenian regions ",
