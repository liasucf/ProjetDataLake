    "text": "Barbara Stanwyck (born Ruby Catherine Stevens; July 16, 1907 \u2013 January 20, 1990) was an American actress, model and dancer. A stage, film and television star, she was known during her 60-year career as a consummate and versatile professional for her strong, realistic screen presence. A favorite of directors including Cecil B. DeMille, Fritz Lang and Frank Capra, she made 85 films in 38 years before turning to television. Stanwyck got her start on the stage in the chorus as a Ziegfeld girl in 1923 at age 16 and within a few years was acting in plays. She was then cast in her first lead role in Burlesque (1927), becoming a Broadway star. Soon after that, Stanwyck obtained film roles and got her major break when Frank Capra chose her for his romantic drama Ladies of Leisure (1930), which led to additional lead roles. In 1937 she had the title role in Stella Dallas and received her first Academy Award nomination for best actress. In 1941 she starred in two successful screwball comedies: Ball of Fire with Gary Cooper, and The Lady Eve with Henry Fonda. She received her second Academy Award nomination for Ball of Fire, and in recent decades The Lady Eve has come to be regarded as a romantic comedy classic with Stanwyck's performance called one of the best in American comedy. By 1944, Stanwyck had become the highest-paid woman in the United States. She starred alongside Fred MacMurray in the seminal film noir Double Indemnity (1944), playing the smoldering wife who persuades MacMurray's insurance salesman to kill her husband. Described as one of the ultimate portrayals of villainy, it is widely thought that Stanwyck should have won the Academy Award for Best Actress rather than being just nominated. She received another Oscar nomination for her lead performance as an invalid wife overhearing her own murder plot in the thriller film noir, Sorry, Wrong Number (1948). After she moved into television in the 1960s, she won three Emmy Awards \u2013 for The Barbara Stanwyck Show (1961), the western series The Big Valley (1966), and miniseries The Thorn Birds (1983). She received an Honorary Oscar in 1982, the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1986 and was the recipient of several other honorary lifetime awards. She was ranked as the 11th greatest female star of classic American cinema by the American Film Institute. American Film Institute; retrieved November 17, 2011. An orphan at the age of four, and partially raised in foster homes, she always worked; one of her directors, Jacques Tourneur, said of Stanwyck, \"She only lives for two things, and both of them are work.\"Basinger, Jeanine, The Star Machine, Knopf, 2007, p. 371 ==Early life== Barbara Stanwyck was born Ruby Catherine Stevens on July 16, 1907, in Brooklyn, New York. She was the fifthand youngestchild of Catherine Ann (n\u00e9e McPhee) (1870-1911) and Byron E. Stevens (1872-1919), working-class parents. Her father, of English descent, was a native of Lanesville, Massachusetts, and her mother, of Scottish descent, was an immigrant from Sydney, Nova Scotia.Callahan 2012, pp. 5\u20136.\"Ruby Catherine Stevens \"Barbara Stanwyck.\" Rootsweb; retrieved April 17, 2012.Madsen 1994, p. 8. When Ruby was four, her mother died of complications from a miscarriage after she was knocked off a moving streetcar by a drunk.Callahan 2012, p. 6. Two weeks after the funeral, her father joined a work crew digging the Panama Canal and was never seen again by his family.Madsen 1994, p. 9. Ruby and her older brother, Malcolm Byron (later nicknamed \"By\") Stevens, were raised by their eldest sister Laura Mildred (later Mildred Smith), who died of a heart attack at age 45.Mildred G. Smith: New York, New York City Municipal Deaths, May 7, 1931 When Mildred got a job as a showgirl, Ruby and Byron were placed in a series of foster homes (as many as four in a year), from which young Ruby often ran away.Nassour and Snowberger 2000. {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-right:0; font-size:90%;background:#f0f0f0; color:black; width:30em; max-width:30%;\" cellspacing=\"5\" | style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"I knew that after fourteen I'd have to earn my own living, but I was willing to do that ...

Watching the movies of Pearl White, whom Ruby idolized, also influenced her drive to be a performer.Callahan 2012, p. 222. At the age of 14, she dropped out of school, taking a package wrapping job at a Brooklyn department store.Prono 2008, p. 240. Ruby never attended high school, \"although early biographical thumbnail sketches had her attending Brooklyn's famous Erasmus Hall High School.\"Madsen 1994, p. 11. Soon afterward, she took a filing job at the Brooklyn telephone office for $14 a week, which allowed her to become financially independent.Madsen 1994, pp. 11\u201312. She disliked the job; her real goal was to enter show business, even as her sister Mildred discouraged the idea. She then took a job cutting dress patterns for Vogue magazine, but customers complained about her work and she was fired.Madsen 1994, p. 12. Ruby's next job was as a typist for the Jerome H. Remick Music Company; work she reportedly enjoyed, however her continuing ambition was in show business, and her sister finally gave up trying to dissuade her.Madsen 1994, pp. 12\u201313. ==Ziegfeld girl and Broadway success== Stanwyck as a Ziegfeld girl in a 1924 photo by alt= In 1923, a few months before her 16th birthday, Ruby auditioned for a place in the chorus at the Strand Roof, a nightclub over the Strand Theatre in Times Square.Madsen 1994, p. 13. A few months later, she obtained a job as a dancer in the 1922 and 1923 seasons of the Ziegfeld Follies, dancing at the New Amsterdam Theater. \"I just wanted to survive and eat and have a nice coat\", Stanwyck said.Callahan 2012, p. 9.Prono 2008, p. 241. For the next several years, she worked as a chorus girl, performing from midnight to seven a.m. at nightclubs owned by Texas Guinan. She also occasionally served as a dance instructor at a speakeasy for gays and lesbians owned by Guinan.Madsen 1994, pp. 17\u201318. One of her good friends during those years was pianist Oscar Levant, who described her as being \"wary of sophisticates and phonies.\" Billy LaHiff, who owned a popular pub frequented by showpeople, introduced Ruby in 1926 to impresario Willard Mack.Madsen 1994, p. 21. Mack was casting his play The Noose, and LaHiff suggested that the part of the chorus girl be played by a real one. Mack agreed, and after a successful audition gave the part to Ruby.Madsen 1994, p. 22. She co-starred with Rex Cherryman and Wilfred Lucas.Wayne 2009, p. 17. As initially staged, the play was not a success. In an effort to improve it, Mack decided to expand Ruby's part to include more pathos.Madsen 1994, p. 25. The Noose re-opened on October 20, 1926, and became one of the most successful plays of the season, running on Broadway for nine months and 197 performances. At the suggestion of David Belasco, Ruby changed her name to Barbara Stanwyck by combining the first name from the play Barbara Frietchie with the last name of the actress in the play, Jane Stanwyck; both were found on a 1906 theater program.Madsen 1994, p. 26. Stanwyck became a Broadway star soon afterward, when she was cast in her first leading role in Burlesque (1927). She received rave reviews, and it was a huge hit.Smith 1985, p. 8. Film actor Pat O'Brien would later say on a 1960s talk show, \"The greatest Broadway show I ever saw was a play in the 1920s called 'Burlesque'.\" Arthur Hopkins described in his autobiography To a Lonely Boy, how he came to cast Stanwyck: > After some search for the girl, I interviewed a nightclub dancer who had > just scored in a small emotional part in a play that did not run [The > Noose]. She seemed to have the quality I wanted, a sort of rough poignancy. > She at once displayed more sensitive, easily expressed emotion than I had > encountered since Pauline Lord. She and [Hal] Skelly were the perfect team, > and they made the play a great success. I had great plans for her, but the > Hollywood offers kept coming. There was no competing with them. She became a > picture star. She is Barbara Stanwyck. He also called Stanwyck \"The greatest natural actress of our time\", noting with sadness, \"One of the theater's great potential actresses was embalmed in celluloid.\"Hopkins 1937 Around this time, Stanwyck was given a screen test by producer Bob Kane for his upcoming 1927 silent film Broadway Nights. She lost the lead role because she could not cry in the screen test, but was given a minor part as a fan dancer. This was Stanwyck's first film appearance.\"Barbara Stanwyck.\" Arabella-and-co.com. Retrieved: June 19, 2012. While playing in Burlesque, Stanwyck was introduced to her future husband, actor Frank Fay, by Oscar Levant.Wayne 2009, p. 20. Stanwyck and Fay were married on August 26, 1928, and soon moved to Hollywood. ==Film career== Stanwyck in her award nominated role as Stella Dallas in 1937 Stanwyck's first sound film was The Locked Door (1929), followed by Mexicali Rose, released in the same year. Neither film was successful; nonetheless, Frank Capra chose Stanwyck for his film Ladies of Leisure (1930). Her work in that production established an enduring friendship with the director and led to future roles in his films. Other prominent roles followed, among them as a nurse who saves two little girls from being gradually starved to death by Clark Gable's vicious character in Night Nurse (1931). In Edna Ferber's novel brought to screen by William Wellman, she portrays small town teacher and valiant Midwest farm woman Selena in So Big! (1932). She followed with a performance as an ambitious woman \"sleeping\" her way to the top from \"the wrong side of the tracks\" in Baby Face (1933), a controversial pre-Code classic. In The Bitter Tea of General Yen (1933), another controversial pre-Code film by director Capra, Stanwyck portrays an idealistic Christian caught behind the lines of Chinese civil war kidnapped by warlord Nils Asther. A flop at the time, containing \"mysterious- East mumbo jumbo\", the lavish film is \"dark stuff, and its difficult to imagine another actress handling this ... philosophical conversion as fearlessly as Ms. Stanwyck does. She doesn't make heavy weather of it.\" In Stella Dallas (1937) she plays the self-sacrificing title character who eventually allows her teenage daughter to live a better life somewhere else. She landed her first Academy Award nomination for Best Actress when she was able to portray her character as vulgar, yet sympathetic as required by the movie. Next, she played Molly Monahan in Union Pacific (1939) with Joel McCrea. Stanwyck was reportedly one of the many actresses considered for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind (1939), although she did not receive a screen test. In Meet John Doe she plays an ambitious newspaperwoman with Gary Cooper (1941). thumb|left| {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em; font-size:85%; background:#f0f0f0; color:black; width:20em; max-width:75%;\" cellspacing=\"5\" | style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"That is the kind of woman that makes whole civilizations topple.\" |- | style=\"text-align: left;\" | Kathleen Howard of Stanwyck's character in Ball of FireBeifuss, John.

Stanwyck was also the vulnerable, invalid wife that overhears her own murder being plotted in Sorry, Wrong Number (1948) and the doomed concert pianist in The Other Love (1947). In the latter film's soundtrack, the piano music is actually being performed by Ania Dorfmann, who drilled Stanwyck for three hours a day until the actress was able to synchronize the motion of her arms and hands to match the music's tempo, giving a convincing impression that it is Stanwyck playing the piano.\"Overview: 'The Other Love' (1947).\" Turner Classic movies.

She stepped back into film for the 1964 Elvis Presley film Roustabout, in which she plays a carnival owner. Stanwyck as matriarch Victoria Barkley on The Big Valley The western television series, The Big Valley, which was broadcast on ABC from 1965 to 1969, made her one of the most popular actresses on television, winning her another Emmy. She was billed in the series' opening credits as \"Miss Barbara Stanwyck\" for her role as Victoria, the widowed matriarch of the wealthy Barkley family. In 1965, the plot of her 1940 movie Remember the Night was adapted and used to develop the teleplay for The Big Valley episode \"Judgement in Heaven\". In 1983, Stanwyck earned her third Emmy for The Thorn Birds. In 1985 she made three guest appearances in the primetime soap opera Dynasty prior to the launch of its short-lived spin-off series, The Colbys, in which she starred alongside Charlton Heston, Stephanie Beacham and Katharine Ross.

After moving to Hollywood, the couple adopted a ten-month-old son on December 5, 1932. They named him Dion, later amending the name to Anthony Dion, nicknamed \"Tony\". The marriage was a troubled one. Fay's successful career on Broadway did not translate to the big screen, whereas Stanwyck achieved Hollywood stardom. Fay was reportedly physically abusive to his young wife, especially when he was inebriated.Wayne 2009, p. 37.Callahan 2012, pp. 36, 38.

Her son died in 2006. In 1936, while making the film His Brother's Wife (1936), Stanwyck became involved with her co-star, Robert Taylor. Rather than a torrid romance, their relationship was more one of mentor and pupil. Stanwyck served as support and adviser to the younger Taylor, who had come from a small Nebraska town; she guided his career, and acclimated him to the sophisticated Hollywood culture. The couple began living together, sparking newspaper reports about the two. Stanwyck was hesitant to remarry after the failure of her first marriage. However, their 1939 marriage was arranged with the help of Taylor's studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, a common practice in Hollywood's golden age. Louis B. Mayer had insisted on the two stars marrying and went as far as presiding over arrangements at the wedding.Callahan 2012, p. 75.Wayne 2009, p. 76.
