Flinders Street Station is the only known project the pair worked on together. ==Personal life== ===J.W. Fawcett=== James Fawcett was an English born architect who was first hired by the Victorian Railways in 1889. There he acted as an architectural draftsman, and was most probably involved in the plans for Flinders Street station that had previously been rejected by the Parliamentary Committee. Fawcett was also a contributor to the Arts and Crafts Movement that was embraced by Australia at the time, and he was also a \"foundation member of Australia\u2019s first sculptor\u2019s society \u2013 the Yarra Sculptor\u2019s Society\".Fiddian, Marc (2003), Flinders St Station: Melbourne\u2019s Taj Mahal, Galaxy Print and Design, p. 11 As a metal worker, Fawcett was also involved with the firm Wunderlich Ltd, who were \"Victoria\u2019s major supplier of architectural terracotta and pressed metal architectural features\".Victorian Heritage Database (http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/places/heritage/9715) Fawcett designed the pressed metal ceilings that were heavily incorporated in the construction of Flinders Street station, and can still be seen today throughout the building. His metal work was in the Art Nouveau style, which is also present in his jewelry and clock design. ===H.P.C Ashworth=== Ashworth was born in Australia in 1871. He worked as a civil engineer and was employed by Victorian Railways for many years until he died from illness at the age of 32, in 1903. Ashworth didn't live to see the completion of Flinders Street Station, opened in 1910. ==Notable projects== View of Flinders Street station Clocks above main entrance to Flinders Street station J.W. Fawcett and H.P.C. Ashworth were the winners of a competition held for the detailed design of Melbourne's Flinders Street station. Fawcett and Ashworth's French Renaissance style design, entitled \"the Green Light\", was one of seventeen entries, with a winning prize of \u00a3500 (which at the time was equivalent to a well-paid, two years' wages). Fawcett and Ashworth were both employed by Victorian Railways, and much controversy arose \u2013 particularly initiated by the architect of the runner-up entry, Charles D\u2019Ebro \u2013 as to having an unfair advantage due to this. The designers were constrained by the narrow land for the project, and therefore were required to come up with a solution for the design of the fa\u00e7ade that broke away from the usual practice of layering it, \"bringing forward the more important aspects. The designers claimed they 'broke the building design upwards' instead and attributed more architectural significance to the entrances\".Davies, Jenny (2008), Beyond the Fa\u00e7ade: Flinders Street, more than just a railway station, Endless Possibilities, p. 24) The announcement of the winning entries was made on 22 May 1900, and widely publicised. The judges felt their design adequately addressed all the requirement, and had a more satisfying grandeur than other entries. The French Renaissance style of domes, arches and towers provided a suitable grandeur, which combined with Edwardian and Art Nouveau features made it ultimately unusual in Melbourne (leading to the urban legend that design was intended for Bombay and got mixed up in the post, and comparisons to the Taj Mahal). Much of Fawcett and Ashworth's design is still prevalent today despite the many modifications made after the plans had been selected. The project well exceeded the initial cost constraint of \u00a3102,000 with a total of \u00a3265 061, but the outcome proved to be well worth the expense.buslines.com.au (http://www.buslines.com.au/hillsidetrains/history.html) Flinders Street station became an icon for Melbourne and its famous clocks a meeting point for generations of Melbournians. ==Awards== *Winner of 1899 design competition for Flinders Street station ==See also== *Architecture of Australia ==References== ==Bibliography== Fiddian, Marc (2003), Flinders St Station: Melbourne's Taj Mahal, Galaxy Print and Design Davies, Jenny (2008), Beyond the Fa\u00e7ade: Flinders Street, more than just a railway station, Endless Possibilities The Argus, 21 \u2013 25 May 1900 Edition The Age, 21 \u2013 25 May 1900 Edition Category:Architecture firms of Australia Category:Architecture firms based in Victoria (Australia) Category:Art Nouveau architects ",
