The 70-year-old was thought to have died of dehydration. By 1912 the station had a flock of 10,000 sheep that were to be sheared in early August using 9 stands. The station suffered some damage during an intense storm in 1914, when some out-buildings were destroyed hy the wind. J. P. Meehan reported that rain fell in 20 minutes and several trees were hit by lightning. In 1918 the station shore 28,000 sheep and in 1921 the second shearing of the season saw 8,000 shorn for 214 bales of wool. During the 1919 season two men were struck down with influenza and Meehan took them to Cue for treatment. Upon arrival the men were isolated at the Cue State School. Another man was taken from the station to join them a few days later. Five other men remained at the station but confined to bed for several days.
