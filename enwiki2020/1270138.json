The Polish\u2013Lithuanian Union was a relationship created by a series of acts and alliances between the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania that lasted for prolonged periods of time from 1385 and led to the creation of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth - the \"Republic of the Two Nations\" - in 1569 and eventually to the creation of a unitary state in 1791.Catholic Encyclopedia - Poland Important events in the process of union included: * 1385 \u2013 Union of Krewo \u2013 a personal union that brought the Grand Duke of Lithuania, Jogaila, to the Polish throne * 1401 \u2013 Union of Vilnius and Radom \u2013 strengthened the Polish\u2013Lithuanian union * 1413 \u2013 Union of Horod\u0142o \u2013 heraldic union which granted many szlachta rights to Lithuanian nobility * 1432 (1432\u201334) \u2013 Union of Grodno, a declarative attempt to renew closer union * 1499 \u2013 Union of Krak\u00f3w and Vilnius, in which the personal union became a dynastic union, recognising the sovereignty of Lithuania and describing interaction between the two states * 1501 \u2013 Union of Mielnik \u2013 a renewal of the personal union * July 1, 1569 \u2013 Union of Lublin \u2013 a real union that resulted in creation of the semi-federal, semi-confederal Republic of the Two Nations (Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth) * May 3, 1791 \u2013 Polish Constitution of May 3, 1791: abolished the Elective monarchy and turned it into a hereditary monarchy, and established a common state, the Rzeczpospolita Polska (the Polish Commonwealth) in their place. The Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations modified these changes, stressing the continuity of bi-national status of the state. The changes were reversed completely in 1792 under pressure from forces of the Russian Empire. ==See also== * Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569\u20131795) * Polish\u2013Lithuanian\u2013Ruthenian Commonwealth * Polish\u2013Lithuanian\u2013Muscovite Commonwealth * Union of K\u0117dainiai * Polish\u2013Swedish union ==Notes== ==References== * Anna Pasterak, Unie polsko- litewskie, Pedagogical University of Cracow, 2004 *Central European Superpower, Henryk Litwin, BUM Magazine, October 2016 .
