It is organised by the sport's governing body in the country, the Cook Islands Cricket Association (CICA), which has been an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 2000. The Cook Islands made its international debut at the 2012 ICC East Asia-Pacific regional qualifiers for the World Twenty20, but lost every match, finishing last. They improved slightly at the 2014 edition, winning a single match (against Vanuatu) and placing fourth out of five teams. Their next major tournament is the women's event at the 2015 Pacific Games in Port Moresby. In April 2018, the ICC granted full Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between the Cook Islands women and another international side after 1 July 2018 will be a full WT20I. ==History== Unlike in many other Pacific island countries, where women's cricket has been played alongside the men's game, women's cricket was only introduced to the Cook Islands in 2009.Matariki Wilson (29 January 2015). \"Lifetime service award for local cricket diehard\" \u2013 Cook Islands News.
