By virtue of this office both were exempted from wearing the Jew-badge, and were endowed with power to enforce the collection of the royal customs. During their term of office the Jews of Portugal were relieved of all imposts except the poll- tax. ==References== Category:14th-century Sephardi Jews Category:Court Jews Category:Medieval Portuguese Jews Category:Tax collectors Category:14th- century businesspeople ",
