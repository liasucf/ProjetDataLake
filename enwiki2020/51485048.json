It is held in April to mark the time when pear trees that are a traditional part of the town's economy come into blossom. It was founded in 1954. The event includes seasonal activities such as promotion of local agriculture, a running race, cycling events along the Rogue River and a pageant. In 1967, Leonard Nimoy was invited to act as grand marshal and provided the parade with the only known appearance of Nimoy as Spock of Star Trek fame in public. There was no festival in 2020 on grounds of COVID-19 pandemic. ==References== ==External links== * *Pear Blossom Run Category:Festivals in Oregon Category:1954 establishments in Oregon Category:Spring festivals in the United States Category:Medford, Oregon Category:Festivals established in 1954 Category:Flower festivals in the United States Category:Annual events in Oregon Category:Parades in the United States ",
