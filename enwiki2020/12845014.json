She was ordered by the Senate of the Grand Duchy of Finland for the Finnish naval equipage (Suomen Meriekipaasi). She was named in honour of Rurik, the semi-legendary founder of ancient Russia. Rurik was designed by Johan Eberhard von Schantz. She was built in Turku at Gamla Warfsbolaget i \u00c5bo and launched in October 1851. At the time of her construction she was the largest ship ever built in Finland. The Scottish engineer William Crichton was recruited to supervise construction of the steam engine.Keisarin messinkilelu oli antimagneettinen erikoisuus (Turun Sanomat) Later he took over the engine builder Cowie & Ericsson and renamed it W:m Crichton & C:o. Although financed by Finns, the ship ended up serving as an escort vessel to the Russian Imperial Yacht. She survived the Crimean War, and later served in the Russian Baltic Fleet. ==See also== * Rurik (1892) - armoured cruiser sunk at the Battle of Ulsan * Rurik (1906) - Russian armoured cruiser built by Vickers ==References== Category:Ships of the Imperial Russian Navy Category:Naval ships of Finland Category:Ships built in Turku Category:Naval ships of Russia Category:1851 ships ",
