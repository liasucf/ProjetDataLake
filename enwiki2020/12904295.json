It is one of five species of Pandanus that are endemic to Seychelles. ==Description== The prominent stilt-roots of Pandanus sechellarum This large species (up to 15 meters in height) has extremely large and prominent stilt-roots, that grow individually and far apart, from high up on the trunk. Its medium-sized (30 cm), spherical fruit-body contains about 70 individual fruit segments, and hangs from the stem on a stalk. ==Distribution and habitat== Pandanus sechellarum was formerly one of the most common species in the indigenous vegetation of the Seychelles, to which it is endemic. Currently it is usually found on steep terrain, river valleys or in accessible mountain tops. Other indigenous Pandanus of the Seychelles include Pandanus balfourii, Pandanus hornei and Pandanus multispicatus. The Madagascan species Pandanus utilis is introduced and is now also widespread. ==References== sechellarum Category:Trees of Seychelles Category:Vulnerable plants Category:Endemic flora of Seychelles Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Plants described in 1877 Category:Taxa named by Isaac Bayley Balfour ",
