    "text": "Demon Days Live was a limited concert tour performed by the British alternative rock virtual band Gorillaz, in support of their second studio album Demon Days. Demon Days Live consisted of two residencies, with five shows played at the Manchester Opera House in England, and another five played at New York City's Apollo Theater. The Manchester residency was later released onto DVD as Demon Days: Live at the Manchester Opera House. One of the New York shows was broadcast on MHD (now MTV Live) as Gorillaz: Live in Harlem. The Manchester Opera House film was later nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Music Film. ==Live band== * Vocals/piano/melodica \u2013 Damon Albarn * MD/keyboards \u2013 Mike Smith * Guitar \u2013 Simon Tong * Guitar - Simon Jones * Bass \u2013 Morgan Nicholls * Drums \u2013 Cass Browne * Turntable \u2013 Darren Galea * Percussion - Karl Vanden Bossche ===Backing vocalists=== * Wayne Hernandez * Sharlene Hector * Rosie Wilson * Wendi Rose * Aaron Sokell ===String Section=== * Cello \u2013 Isabelle Dunn * Cello \u2013 Dan Keane * Bass \u2013 Emma Smith * Viola \u2013 Amanda Drummond * Viola \u2013 Nina Kapinsky * Violin \u2013 Antonia Pagulatos * Violin \u2013 Jennifer Berman * Violin \u2013 Kirsty Mangan * Viola \u2013 Gary Pomeroy * Cello \u2013 Deborah Chandler ===Guests=== * Neneh Cherry - Guest vocals on \"Kids with Guns\" * Bootie Brown - Guest rap on \"Dirty Harry\" * De La Soul - Guest raps on \"Feel Good Inc\" * Ike Turner - Guest piano on \"Every Planet We Reach is Dead\" * MF Doom - Guest rap on \"November Has Come\" (video only) * Roots Manuva - Guest rap on \"All Alone\" * Martina Topley-Bird - Guest vocals on \"All Alone\" * Rosie Wilson - Guest vocals on \"Dare\" * Shaun Ryder - Guest vocals on \"Dare\" * Dennis Hopper - Spoken word vocals on \"Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head\" (New York dates only) * The London Community Gospel Choir - Guest vocals on \"Don't Get Lost in Heaven\" and \"Demon Days\" * Zeng Zhen \u2013 Guest guzheng on \"Hong Kong\" * Ibrahim Ferrer - Guest vocals on \"Latin Simone (\u00bfQu\u00e9 Pasa Contigo?)\" (via video) ==Production== While guest artists performed under spotlights, Damon Albarn and bandmates were kept silhouetted for the entire concert. Demon Days Live marked the first Gorillaz concerts where the live band performed in full view of the audience, forgoing the \"behind-the- screen\" setup of Gorillaz' previous tour. Visuals and music videos tailor-made for the shows played on a large screen above the band, while the band themselves were kept silhouetted by a combination of dim lighting and colorful, illuminated back-paneling. Puppets of 2-D and Murdoc were utilized during intros and intermissions, addressing the audience and commenting on the show from the venues' balconies. The lifesize puppets were created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop; the Jim Henson Company would later award Gorillaz with the \"Jim Henson Creativity Honor\". A Las Vegas residency was considered, but the \"astronomical\" production cost of previous shows dissuaded the band from continuing the concerts. Speaking on tour expenses, Gorillaz co-creator Jamie Hewlett explained: \"The idea of putting it on in Vegas really appealed, but in the end it would have cost too much. The Demon Days Live shows actually ended up costing Damon and I money overall.\" ==Setlist== The following setlist is obtained from the concert held in Manchester on 1 November 2005.
