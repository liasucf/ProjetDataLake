In 1996, Zeav ganj and Tamir Kliski, members of the band \"Ethnix\", were searching for a Mizrahi singer for producing a music album. The two saw Golan in a concert in the \"Chava Club\" in Petah Tikva, and decided to feature Golan's vocals the album.

However, because of financial disputes, they stopped working together. In 2008, Golan put out the album Hoze Otah Muli (in Hebrew \u05d4\u05d5\u05d6\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05da \u05de\u05d5\u05dc\u05d9 meaning Imagining you facing me) and in two months sold over 145,000 albums. Based on the immense success of the album he toured in Israel including important shows at the Caesarea Amphitheater in 2008 and 2009. He also toured internationally, remaining very popular in all countries of the Jewish Diaspora and with world music enthusiasts.

He lived in Rehovot until 2010 before moving to Tel Aviv. When he was 4 his parents divorced and Eyal lived with his mother's family.

Golan and Greenberg welcomed a baby girl on the 29th of August 2020 named Miel (Honey in Spanish). ===Statutory rape allegations=== In November 2013, Golan was arrested as part of a group of men suspected of having sex with underage girls. Golan denied the charges, but admitted that his father, Danny Biton, had brought girls to his home to have sex with him. Although the charges against Golan were later dropped for lack of evidence, the allegations caused Golan's songs to receive less radio airplay and for performances to be cancelled. In December 2018, Golan was recognized by the Knesset, but many MKs and women's groups expressed anger that he would be honored. Protesters interrupted the event, but were removed by security before Golan performed a duet with MK Nava Boker, the chairwoman of the Knesset Caucus for Hebrew Music. ===Tax Evasion=== In 2014 Golan plead guilty of evading 2.5 million hazan NIS worth of taxes. He was sentenced to 4 months of community service, a fine of 75,000 NIS.ganj-performer-is-refused-an-american- visa/ Israeli performer denied a US visa ==Discography== 220px ;Studio albums * 1995 \u2013 Lechisha Ba'Layla \u2013 \u05dc\u05d7\u05d9\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4 (A Whisper in the Night) * 1997 \u2013 Biladaich \u2013 \u05d1\u05dc\u05e2\u05d3\u05d9\u05d9\u05da (Without You) * 1998 \u2013 Chayal Shel Ahavah \u2013 \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dc \u05e9\u05dc \u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05d4 (Soldier of Love) * 1999 \u2013 Histakli Elay \u2013 \u05d4\u05e1\u05ea\u05db\u05dc\u05d9 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9 (Look at Me) * 2001 \u2013 Tzlil Meytar \u2013 \u05e6\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc \u05de\u05d9\u05ea\u05e8 (String sound) * 2002 \u2013 v'Ani Kore Lach \u2013 \u05d5\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e7\u05d5\u05e8\u05d0 \u05dc\u05da (And I Call You) * 2003 \u2013 Chalomot \u2013 \u05d7\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u2013 (Dreams) * 2005 \u2013 Metziut Acheret \u2013 \u05de\u05e6\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea \u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05ea (A Different Reality) * 2007 \u2013 Bishvilech Notzarti \u2013 \u05d1\u05e9\u05d1\u05d9\u05dc\u05da \u05e0\u05d5\u05e6\u05e8\u05ea\u05d9 (I Was Made For You) * 2008 \u2013 Hoze Otach Muli \u2013 \u05d4\u05d5\u05d6\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05da \u05de\u05d5\u05dc\u05d9 (Imagining You Facing Me) * 2009 \u2013 Ze Ani \u2013 \u05d6\u05d4 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 (That's Me) * 2010 \u2013 Derech LaChayim \u2013 \u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05dc\u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd (A Way of Life) * 2011 \u2013 Chelek Michayay \u2013 \u05d7\u05dc\u05e7 \u05de\u05d7\u05d9\u05d9 (Part of My Life) * 2012 \u2013 Nagaat Li Balev \u2013 \u05e0\u05d2\u05e2\u05ea \u05dc\u05d9 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d1 (You touched my heart) * 2013 \u2013 Halev Al Hashulchan \u2013 \u05d4\u05dc\u05d1 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05e9\u05d5\u05dc\u05d7\u05df (The heart is on the table) * 2014 \u2013 Yamim Yagidu \u2013 \u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05d9\u05d2\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5 (Time will tell) * 2015 \u2013 Besof Kol Yom \u2013 \u05d1\u05e1\u05d5\u05e3 \u05db\u05dc \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd (At the End of Every Day) * 2016 \u2013 Rachok Mikan \u2013 \u05e8\u05d7\u05d5\u05e7 \u05de\u05db\u05d0\u05df (Far away from here) * 2017 \u2013 Lo Pashut Lihiot Pashut \u2013 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05e4\u05e9\u05d5\u05d8 \u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05e4\u05e9\u05d5\u05d8 (It is not simple to be simple) * 2017 \u2013 Osef Meshulash \u2013 \u05d0\u05d5\u05e1\u05e3 \u05de\u05e9\u05d5\u05dc\u05e9 (Triple Collection) * 2018 \u2013 Nakhon Letamid \u2013 \u05e0\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05dc\u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05d3 (Right forever) * 2019 \u2013 Hafokh Mehayekum \u2013 \u05d4\u05e4\u05d5\u05da \u05de\u05d4\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05dd (Upside down from the universe) * 2020 - Mikan v'Ad Hanetsach - \u05de\u05db\u05d0\u05df \u05d5\u05e2\u05d3 \u05d4\u05e0\u05e6\u05d7 (From here to eternity) ;Live albums * 1996 \u2013 BeHofa'a Haya \u2013 \u05d1\u05d4\u05d5\u05e4\u05e2\u05d4 \u05d7\u05d9\u05d4 (Live in Concert) * 2000 \u2013 haMofa'a haMeshoutaf: Ethnix v'Eyal Golan \u2013 \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05e4\u05e2 \u05d4\u05de\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea\u05e3 \u05e2\u05dd \u05d0\u05ea\u05e0\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (The Duet Concert of Ethnix and Eyal Golan) * 2008 \u2013 Eyal Golan Baheichal Hatarbut \u2013 \u05d0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dc \u05d2\u05d5\u05dc\u05df \u05d1\u05d4\u05d9\u05db\u05dc \u05d4\u05ea\u05e8\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea (Eyal Golan Live at Heichal Hatarbut (also on DVD) * 2009 \u2013 Eyal Golan Caesarea (2009) * 2010 \u2013 Eyal Golan at Nokia Arena (2011) * 2011 \u2013 Eyal Golan part of my life Live the Sultan's Pool (2012) * 2012 \u2013 Eyal Golan Caesarea (You touched my heart) * 2013 \u2013 Eyal Golan Caesarea (The heart is on the table) * 2016 \u2013 Eyal Golan With Ma Kasur Live In Caesarea (2016) ==See also== * Mizrahi Music ==References== ==External links== * Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Mizrahi singers Category:Israeli male singers Category:Israeli Jews Category:Israeli people of Moroccan-Jewish descent Category:Israeli people of Yemeni-Jewish descent Category:Jewish footballers Category:Israeli footballers Category:Hapoel Marmorek F.C. players Category:Maccabi Sha'arayim F.C. players Category:Beitar Kfar Saba F.C. players Category:People from Rehovot Category:Football players from Rehovot Category:Association footballers not categorized by position Category:Music YouTubers ",
