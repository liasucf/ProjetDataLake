Besides the village of Dortan itself, the commune includes the hamlets of Uffel, Vouais, Bonaz, Emondeau, S\u00e9nissiat and Maissiat. The population was 1,845 in 2014. ==History== This area was settled in the first century AD by the Sequani, a Gallic people. It was on a route used by the Romans and by the seventh century, the Abbaye de Saint-Claude had been established nearby and the area was evangelized. During the feudal period in the ninth century, the counts were Lambert and Geoffroy de Dortenc, and twenty generations of these seignieres followed. The Ch\u00e2teau de Dortan was built in the fifteenth century as a replacement for the original twelfth century building. It was attacked on many occasions, including by Cardinal Richelieu in 1637. The last of the de Dortenc lineage was Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Dortenc, who died in 1708. He had committed various misdeeds and his successor sold the ch\u00e2teau to Pierre Gaulthier, adviser and secretary of Louis XIV. Today the ch\u00e2teau is in private ownership and is included in the list of Monument historiques. ===1944 massacre=== In July 1944, during World War II, the Germans looted and burned the village in reprisal for activities by the French Maquis. Seven people were shot on July 12, including the village priest and a woman. The following day, three villagers were killed and women were raped. On 20 and 21 July, 15 men were arrested and tortured at the ch\u00e2teau, which was occupied by the German troops. The next day, the remaining inhabitants were rounded up and gathered in the ch\u00e2teau while the houses in the village were burnt down. In total, 35 civilians were killed, the village was razed and only the ch\u00e2teau was left standing. ==Geography== Dortan is in the extreme north of the department of Ain in central eastern France, in the district of Nantua close to the Swiss border.
