Women's Lacrosse: A Guide for Advanced Players and Coaches, p.155. JHU. . is a children's game which can be played by two players. One player extends their hands forward, roughly at arm's length, with the palms down. The other player's hands, also roughly at arm's length, are placed, palms up, under the first player's hands. The object of the game is for the second player to slap the back of the first player's hands before the first player can pull them away. If the slapping player misses, the players swap roles and play again. The slapper is on offense and must act with sufficient speed, because the slappee's goal is to pull their hands away, and out of the area where the hands overlap, to avoid the slap. The slapper can only slap the hand it is underneath. The slappee is on defense and attempts to avoid having his hands slapped, by pulling his hands away as the slapper brings his hands over to attempt a slap. However, the slappee cannot flinch too much in attempting to avoid a slap: in one variation of the game, if the slappee pulls his hands away when the slapper has not brought his hands around, then the slappee must submit to a \"free slap\" by the slapper. ==Variations== Another variation is where the slappee has their hands held palms together, held out at mid-torso height; the slapper then does the same with the tips of the fingers of both players hands around a centimetre apart, and then (with just one of their hands) the slapper tries to slap the backs of the slappee's hands. You can slap the slappee's hands with just one of your hands as a strategical move. Another variation is play as above but with one (or both) player(s) blindfolded. ==See also== *Red hand (disambiguation) *Bloody knuckles *Mercy (game) *Slapjack ==References== Category:Hand games Category:Children's games Category:Endurance games ",
