He won 18 times on the regular PBA Tour, and seven more times on the Senior PBA Tour. Soutar was raised on the east side of Detroit, Michigan and is currently a resident of Bradenton, FL. ==Career== A 1958 graduate of Denby High School,http://www.admin.mtu.edu/urel/news/clips/2003-04/04_05_20.pdf Soutar developed his bowling talent at many of Detroit's bowling alleys, leading to his pro career beginning with a bang in 1961, when he won the PBA National Championship at age 21. His only other PBA major title came in the 1973 ABC Masters (now USBC Masters). He had a career best year in 1970, winning four times, finishing third in earnings, and claiming the PBA's Steve Nagy Sportsmanship Award. He was a 1979 inductee into the PBA Hall of Fame. Soutar continued his success at the senior level, capturing major championships at the 1999 Senior Tournament of Champions, 2000 USBC Senior Masters and 2003 Senior U.S. Open. He is the first PBA player to win both the USBC Masters and Senior USBC Masters in a career, a feat not repeated until Walter Ray Williams, Jr. captured the Senior USBC Masters in 2014. He is also one of only three bowlers to win a regular or Senior PBA title in five decades (joining Dick Weber and Johnny Petraglia). In 2011, Soutar set the all-time record for Senior PBA Tour appearances when he bowled in his 250th event in Dayton, Ohio.Vint, Bill. \"Dave Soutar Closes 2011 Senior Tour Season with Record 250 Appearances.\" Article at www.pba.com on August 31, 2011.
