    "text": "Guacanagarix (alternate transcriptions: Guacanacar\u00edc, Guacanagar\u00ed) was one of five Ta\u00edno caciques of the Caribbean island henceforth known as Hispaniola at the arrival of the Europeans in 1492. This was contemporaneous with the first of the voyages of Christopher Columbus. He was the chief of the cacicazgo of Mari\u00e9n, which occupied the northwest of the island. Guacanagarix received Christopher Columbus after the Santa Mar\u00eda was wrecked during his first voyage to the New World. He allowed Columbus to establish the settlement of La Navidad near his village. The colonists that remained there were killed by a rival tribe before Columbus returned on his second voyage. Guacanagarix refused to ally himself with other caciques, who were trying to expel the Spaniards from the colony of Santo Domingo, and many times served as an informant and spy for the European settlers. ==See also== *Ta\u00edno peoples *Ta\u00edno rebellion of 1511 *Colony of Santo Domingo topics *Spanish West Indies *Chiefdoms of Hispaniola ==References== *See: \"El primer virreinato americano\" by Roberto Cass\u00e1, Raimundo Gonz\u00e1lez de Pe\u00f1a, Genaro Rodr\u00edguez Morel.
