    "text": "The Royal Rumble is a professional wrestling event, produced every January since 1988 by professional wrestling promotion WWE. It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a battle royal whose participants enter at timed intervals. After the initial event was broadcast as a television special on USA Network, the Royal Rumble has been shown on pay-per-view and is one of WWE's \"Big Four\", along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series.Ian Hamilton. Wrestling's Sinking Ship: What Happens to an Industry Without Competition (p. 160) == History == === Event === The Royal Rumble is a pay- per-view consisting of the Royal Rumble match, title matches, and various other matches. The first Royal Rumble event took place on January 24, 1988, and was broadcast live on the USA Network.Ric Flair. Ric Flair: To Be the Man (p.161) The following year, the event started to be broadcast on pay-per-view and thus became one of WWE's \"big four\" pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Survivor Series, and SummerSlam.Brian Shields. Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s (p.166) The men's Royal Rumble match is usually located at the top of the card, though there have been exceptions, such as the 1988, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2006, 2013, and 2018 events. Due to the Rumble match taking up a large amount of time (most Rumble matches last roughly one hour), the Rumble event tends to have a smaller card than most other pay-per-view events, which routinely have six to eight matches per card. The 2008 Royal Rumble was the first WWE pay-per-view to be available in high-definition. The 2018 Royal Rumble was the first to include a women's Royal Rumble match, which was the main event for that year. === Match === The Royal Rumble is based on the classic Battle Royal match, in which a number of wrestlers (traditionally 30) aim at eliminating their competitors by tossing them over the top rope, with both feet touching the floor. The winner of the event is the last wrestler remaining after all others have been eliminated. According to Hornswoggle, who worked for WWE from 2006 until 2016 and participated in two Rumbles, participants may learn their eliminations by knowing the two wrestlers who are eliminated before them and which wrestlers are entering the Royal Rumble before and after their elimination. == Dates, venues, and winners == {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |+List of Royal Rumble dates, venues, and winners ! !Event !Date !City !Venue !Main event !Winner(s) !Entry No. !Ref |- | |scope=row style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"|Royal Rumble (1988) |style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"|January 24, 1988 |Hamilton, Ontario |Copps Coliseum | | | | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (1989) |January 15, 1989 |Houston, Texas |The Summit |rowspan=\"3\"| | | | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (1990) |January 21, 1990 |Orlando, Florida |Orlando Arena |rowspan=\"2\"| | | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (1991) |January 19, 1991 |Miami, Florida |Miami Arena | | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (1992) |January 19, 1992 |Albany, New York |Knickerbocker Arena | | | | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (1993) |January 24, 1993 |Sacramento, California |ARCO Arena | |Yokozuna | | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (1994) |January 23, 1994 |Providence, Rhode Island |style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"|Providence Civic Center | |Bret Hart Lex Luger | | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (1995) |January 22, 1995 |Tampa, Florida |USF Sun Dome | |rowspan=\"2\"| | | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (1996) |January 21, 1996 |Fresno, California |Selland Arena | | | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (1997) |January 19, 1997 |San Antonio, Texas |Alamodome | |rowspan=\"2\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"|Stone Cold Steve Austin | | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (1998) |January 18, 1998 |San Jose, California |San Jose Arena | | | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (1999) |January 24, 1999 |Anaheim, California |Arrowhead Pond | |Mr. McMahon | | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (2000) |January 23, 2000 |New York City, New York |Madison Square Garden | | | | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (2001) |January 21, 2001 |New Orleans, Louisiana |New Orleans Arena | |Stone Cold Steve Austin | | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (2002) |January 20, 2002 |Atlanta, Georgia |Philips Arena | |Triple H | | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (2003) |January 19, 2003 |Boston, Massachusetts |FleetCenter | | | | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (2004) |January 25, 2004 |style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |Wachovia Center | |Chris Benoit | | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (2005) |January 30, 2005 |Fresno, California |Save Mart Center | |Batista | | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (2006) |January 29, 2006 |Miami, Florida |American Airlines Arena | | | | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (2007) |January 28, 2007 |San Antonio, Texas |AT&T; Center | | | | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (2008) |January 27, 2008 |New York City, New York |Madison Square Garden | | | | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (2009) |January 25, 2009 |Detroit, Michigan |Joe Louis Arena | | | | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (2010) |January 31, 2010 |Atlanta, Georgia |Philips Arena | |Edge |29 | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (2011) |January 30, 2011 |Boston, Massachusetts |TD Garden | | |38 | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (2012) |January 29, 2012 |St. Louis, Missouri |Scottrade Center | |Sheamus |22 | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (2013) |January 27, 2013 |Phoenix, Arizona |US Airways Center | | |19 | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (2014) |January 26, 2014 |Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania |Consol Energy Center | |Batista |28 | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (2015) |January 25, 2015 |Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |Wells Fargo Center | | |19 |Royal Rumble (2015)#Results |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (2016) |January 24, 2016 |Orlando, Florida |Amway Center | |Triple H |30 | |- | |scope=row|Royal Rumble (2017) |January 29, 2017 |San Antonio, Texas |Alamodome | |Randy Orton |23 | |- | rowspan=\"2\" | |rowspan=\"2\"|Royal Rumble (2018) |rowspan=\"2\"|January 28, 2018 |rowspan=\"2\"|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |rowspan=\"2\"|Wells Fargo Center |rowspan=\"2\"| |Shinsuke Nakamura |14 | |- |Asuka |25 | |- | rowspan=\"2\" | | rowspan=\"2\" |Royal Rumble (2019) | rowspan=\"2\" |January 27, 2019 | rowspan=\"2\" |Phoenix, Arizona | rowspan=\"2\" |Chase Field | rowspan=\"2\" | |Becky Lynch |28 | rowspan=\"2\" | |- |Seth Rollins | 10 |- | rowspan=\"2\" | | rowspan=\"2 | Royal Rumble (2020) | rowspan=\"2 | January 26, 2020 | rowspan=\"2 | Houston, Texas | rowspan=\"2 | Minute Maid Park | rowspan=\"2\" | |Charlotte Flair |17 | rowspan=\"2\" | |- |Drew McIntyre |16 |} == Video box set == In March 2007, WWE released a complete DVD box set titled Royal Rumble: The Complete Anthology, which showcases every Royal Rumble event in its entirety, up to the 2007 Royal Rumble. == References == ; General * * * * * * * ; Specific == Further reading == * * * * * * == External links == * * WWE.com: Royal Rumble match description * WWE.com: Royal Rumble Facts & Figures * Royal Rumble History at About.com * WWE Royal Rumble ",
