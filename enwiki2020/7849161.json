AGSEP describes itself as Government Associated Organisation because of its consultancy status to the Sri Lankan Ministry of Disaster Relief Services and the Ministry for Rehabilitation & District Development. ==Profile== AGSEP works mainly with internship students from leading German universities doing their undergraduate and postgraduate studies in the fields of economics, political science, social science, engineering, sport and other disciplines. The Asian German Sports Exchange Programme (A.G.S.E.P.)has been conducting sport events and international exchanges between Sri Lankan and European sport teams since 1989. The organisation is based in Marawila, in rural western Sri Lanka, and was founded by the current CEO of the programme, Dr. Dietmar D\u00f6ring, who at that time was the national coach of the table tennis team. Dr. D\u00f6ring saw an opportunity to use sport events as an avenue to enhance tourism and the relationships between estranged ethnic communities in Sri Lanka. The philosophy of A.G.S.E.P. is that sport is an ideal way of connecting people and transcending social, cultural, ethnic and religious cleavages. Sport provides a neutral platform for all participants, who are able to experience and learn from each other in a playful and open atmosphere. AGSEP's mission it to assist the divided ethnic groups of Sri Lanka to find peace by exposing the children of the island to children of other ethnic groups as part of sporting events. ==History== The German social education worker Dietmar Doering founded AGSEP while he was a national coach for the table tennis team of Sri Lanka. Since 1989, against the background of a long-lasting civil war, AGSEP has promoted integrative sport events as peaceful intergroup sport encounters that popularise social values such as intercultural togetherness, respect, courage, commitment, and appreciation through active participation and exchange. Integrative sport events are planned, organised, implemented and staged in co-operation with the three major ethnic groups on the island, Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims.
