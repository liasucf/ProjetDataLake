    "text": "Magic Bytes is an American software development company and video game publisher. It develops software for immersive experiences in Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality for education, entertainment and training simulation. The company was founded in 2017 by Thomas Meiertoberens, who originally introduced the label Magic Bytes in 1987 for publishing the first video game adaptions of comic characters Clever & Smart, Pink Panther and Tom & Jerry. == History == Before founding Magic Bytes in 2017, Thomas Meiertoberens co- founded Rainbow Arts in 1984, a game development company based in Germany. 1987-2000 In 1986, Meiertoberens obtained licenses to produce and market video games in Europe of comic characters Clever & Smart, Pink Panther and Tom & Jerry. Several European distributors agreed in 1987 to sell Magic Bytes video games in their territories. Most games were adapted for Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore C64 & Amiga, some for MSX, ZX Spectrum and later mostly for PC's. In 1990, German book publisher Falkenverlag agreed to co-produce Wall$treet, an educational stock exchange simulation program. Wall$treet became the first Magic Bytes game released in North America. In 1997, Meiertoberens moved permanently to the United States and focused on real estate investment. In 2000, the last Magic Bytes game was released with a total of 32 video games for that time period. 2017-present In 2017, Thomas Meiertoberens re-launched Magic Bytes to develop educational and entertainment software including Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. A former Disney Imagineer, Brian Collins, joined Magic Bytes in 2019 and contributed ideas to the game Toonworld. A demo of the game was shown to the public for the first time on Oculus Quest at Otronicon 2020 in the Orlando Science Center. In March 2020, Magic Bytes signed a publishing agreement with James Laudermilk to publish his game Smoke & Mirrors VR for Oculus Rift and other platforms. Smoke & Mirrors VR was originally selected for Oculus Launch Pad 2018 and contains music from singer-songwriter Lexi Scatena. The VR experience lets players perform illusions and is trying to preserve the history of magic. == References == == External links == * Category:Animation Category:Computer programming Category:Education Category:Software companies of the United States Category:Video game developers Category:Virtual reality companies Category:Augmented reality Category:Software companies established in 2017 ",
