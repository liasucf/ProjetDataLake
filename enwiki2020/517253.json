    "text": "Map of European long-distance paths The European long-distance paths (E-paths) are a network of long-distance footpaths that traverse Europe. While most long-distance footpaths in Europe are located in just one country or region, each of these numbered European long-distance paths passes through many different countries. The first long-distance hiking trail in Europe was the National Blue Trail of Hungary, established in 1938. The formation of the European Union made transnational hiking trails possible. The European long- distance paths are designated by the European Ramblers' Association. In general the routes connect and make use of existing national and local trails such as the GR footpaths. Today the network consists of 12 E-paths and covers more than 70,000 km, crisscrossing Europe. The newest E-path is E12, following the northern coast of the Mediterranean Sea. The E-paths are constantly improving and changing in small bits as many persons and organisations are involved in maintaining and upgrading the E-paths. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ List of the 12 European long-distance paths so far defined |- ! # !!
