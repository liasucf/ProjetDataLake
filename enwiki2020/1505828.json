    "text": "The Corrigan (O'Corrigan, Carrigan, Corocan, Courigan, Currigan) surname is of Irish origin. Corrigan means a \"Spear\" in Irish. It is believed to have originated from Coirdhecan in Eoghain. It is also believed to be connected to the Maguire clan. The Corrigan surname was common in the 17th century in County Fermanagh. Today it has spread across most of Ireland, Scotland and to the United States and Canada. The Irish sept \u00d3 Corrag\u00e1in, whose stronghold was in County Fermanagh, is the origin of the names Corrigan, Carrigan, Courigan, Corgan, and Currigan. Early records in the Annals of the Four Masters indicate the name was associated with clerics and abbots. It was well established during the Middle Ages, spreading south into the counties of Monaghan, Meath, Roscommon and Offaly. The village of Ballycorrigan near Nenagh in County Tipperary indicates the name also spread to that county. A Corrigan Coat of Arms consists of a chevron between two trefoils slipt, in chief and in base a wingless dragon passant vert.
