He was a veteran of the Black Hawk War who served in the Wisconsin State Senate and the Wisconsin State Assembly. The house remained in Rountree's family for several decades before one of his descendants left the house to the state. For a number of years, it was used as the residence for the Chancellor of what is now the University of Wisconsin-Platteville. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 and on the State Register of Historic Places in 1989. The Mitchell-Rountree House is also located in Platteville. Rountree built it for his father-in-law, Samuel Mitchell, an American Revolutionary War veteran who served as a Methodist Episcopal clergyman. ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Wisconsin Category:National Register of Historic Places in Grant County, Wisconsin Category:Houses in Grant County, Wisconsin Category:University of Wisconsin\u2013Platteville Category:Neoclassical architecture in Wisconsin Category:Greek Revival architecture in Wisconsin Category:Brick buildings and structures Category:Houses completed in 1854 ",
