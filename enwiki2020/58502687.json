    "text": "The L\u00f3pez Serrano Building was the tallest residential building in Cuba until the construction of the FOCSA in 1956. It was designed by the architect Ricardo Mira in 1929 who in 1941 would also design La Moderna Poesia bookstore on Obispo Street for the same owner. It is often compared to the Bacardi Building in Old Havana, built two years before the L\u00f3pez Serrano Building, because of their similarity in massing and central tower. The congressman, senator and presidential candidate Eduardo Chib\u00e1s was living on the fourteenth floor penthouse when he committed suicide in August 1951 on the air at CMQ Radio Station. == History == Lobby terrazzo floor The construction of the building was promoted by Jos\u00e9 Antonio L\u00f3pez Serrano, a publisher who ran La Moderna Poes\u00eda. He was the son of Ana Lu\u00edsa Serrano and Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Rodr\u00edguez, \"Pote\", a banker with ties to publishing. Pote arrived in Cuba as a poor and illiterate teenager who became an influential banker with ties to the government. In 1890 Pote married Ana Lu\u00edsa Serrano, a wealthy widow who owned one of the best bookstores in Havana, La Moderna Poes\u00eda. After the marriage, Pote took charge of the business opening several branches in other locations in Cuba. Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez's fortune was due not only to his advantageous marriage to Ana Lu\u00edsa but also from supporting the Cuban independence cause. Relations with the main Cuban leaders would bring important economic benefits. Among these political alliances was the figure of General Jos\u00e9 Miguel G\u00f3mez, whom Pote financed the 1907 electoral campaign that would propel G\u00f3mez to the Presidency of the Republic. In 1908 Pote got an exclusive contract to print the tickets of the National Lottery, which translated into extensive financial benefits. He monopolized the printing of official documents such as bonds, stocks, stamps and bank notes, printed in La Casa del Timbre. Later, he would obtain from the Government of G\u00f3mez the concession for the construction of an iron bridge over the Almendares River connecting Calle Calzada with Miramar. Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Rodr\u00edguez committed suicide on March 28, 1921, at the time, he had accumulated 93 million dollars. == A36 steel == Typical floor plan of the Lopez Serrano Building The L\u00f3pez Serrano Building has a U.S. standard structural steel frame system. A36 steel, is a type of structural steel used as a system of construction that is commonly bolted or riveted. As the technology for riveting steel members was absent in Cuba, the frame of the L\u00f3pez Serrano Building was welded in place and the reason for the high level of stiffness of the structure. As with most steels, A36 has a density of . Young's modulus for A36 steel is . A36 steel has a Poisson's ratio of 0.26, and a shear modulus of .Wikipedia contributors, \"A36 steel,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A36_steel&oldid;=926289735 (accessed February 6, 2020). A36 steel in plates, bars, and shapes with a thickness of less than has a minimum yield strength of and ultimate tensile strength of . Plates thicker than 8 in have a yield strength and the same ultimate tensile strength of .Wikipedia contributors, \"A36 steel,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A36_steel&oldid;=926289735 (accessed February 6, 2020). The electrical resistance of A36 is 0.142 \u03bc\u03a9m at 20 \u00b0C. A36 bars and shapes maintain their ultimate strength up to . Afterward, the minimum strength drops off from : at ; at ; at .Wikipedia contributors, \"A36 steel,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A36_steel&oldid;=926289735 (accessed February 6, 2020). === Methods of joining === A36 is readily welded by all welding processes. As a result, the most common welding methods for A36 are the cheapest and easiest: shielded metal arc welding (SMAW, or stick welding), gas metal arc welding (GMAW, or MIG welding), and oxyacetylene welding. A36 steel is also commonly bolted and riveted in structural applications. ==Tower== Steel frame and location of brick walls. Tower above showing twelve support columns.Above the ten stories in the main body of the building, centrally located, is a tower of four apartments supported by ten steel columns that protrude from the main mass. The ten-story block is subdivided into four aisles to allow for a stair, three elevators and a brick wall down the middle which further subdivides the block into two apartments. The two apartment blocks to the east and west, have a line of structural columns running down the middle which in turn subdivide the apartment. An interior public corridor runs perpendicular to the three blocks, parallel to Calle 13, and links to the stair and three elevators. There is secondary stairs near the east entrance with windows at every landing. There were no fire stairs required by the Havana building code. The four luxury tower apartments were occupied by Jos\u00e9 Antonio L\u00f3pez Serrano who lived on the top floor, it was later occupied by Eduardo Chib\u00e1s. ==Walls== The exterior walls are brick with one inch, integral color cement plaster finish. There are raised plaster ornaments on the exterior walls and inscribed lines in the plaster suggesting a masonry bond in the lower part of the wall. There are also terracotta design panels inserted over some of the openings. All the windows and doors of the building are wood and glass in a wood frame. The floor of the apartments are covered with tiles with red and green geometric designs, there are tile baseboards. The interior walls are terracotta tile and covered in cement plaster. The floor of the lobby, the porch, and entrances to the building have ornate designs in red and black or red and green terrazzo. The walls of the lobby are Moroccan, book matched, red marble panels.. There is a nickel-silver relief El Tiempo (\u2018Time\u2019) by graphic designer Enrique Garc\u00eda Cabrera on the elevator wall of the lobby. The elevator doors are pivot hinged and originally were nickel silver with various Art Deco designs. == Distribution == Room distribution within apartments. Typical floor plan Apartment distribution per floor As per Havana zoning laws, the ground floor was required to have a porch facing 13th Street. It also had to provide public, commercial establishments. To this end, the building had various stores, a barbershop, restaurants and coffee shops. The distribution of the upper floors is as follows: from the second to the tenth floor, the building has eight apartments per floor, six with a separate service entrance opening directly into the kitchen and service area. Each apartment has access from the kitchen to what is called in Havana a \"patio\" (dark blue), this is an area equipped with a sink for doing laundry. A similar room labeled a patio can also be found in other modernist buildings such as the FOCSA Building of 1956 and the apartments at the Edificio del Seguro M\u00e9dico of 1958 on La Rampa. The four apartments in the center have two bedrooms each. The east and west apartments have three bedrooms each and an extra small maid's bedroom located next to the kitchen with a toilet and a shower. Each apartment has a small bathroom with a window close to the bedrooms. The main entrance door to the apartment opens directly into the living room. Only the apartments in the center block have a short corridor connecting the bedrooms. This shortage of corridors in the design mandates that the circulation occurs mostly through the rooms thus decreasing their effective square footage. The dining room is connected to the kitchen and the patio. The center apartments on the south side have a smaller entry vestibule. Every apartment was originally provided with modern amenities: hot and cold water, gas, radio, and telephone service. The L\u00f3pez Serrano Building was the country's first co-operative apartment corporation. ==See also== * Bacardi Building (Havana) * FOCSA Building * Eduardo Chib\u00e1s * Jos\u00e9 Miguel G\u00f3mez == References == ==Gallery== File:Havana (262644821).jpg File:Havana (262648351).jpg File:Havana (262645104).jpg File:L\u00f3pez_Serrano_Building_stairs_to_basement_behind_elevator.jpg|Stairs behind elevator to basement.
