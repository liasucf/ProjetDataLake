    "text": "United Nations Security Council resolution 1039, adopted unanimously on 29 January 1996, after recalling previous resolutions on Israel and Lebanon including 501 (1982), 508 (1982), 509 (1982) and 520 (1982) as well as studying the report by the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) approved in 426 (1978), the Council decided to extend the mandate of UNIFIL for a further six months until 31 July 1996. The Council then reemphasised the mandate of the Force and requested the Secretary-General to continue negotiations with the Government of Lebanon and other parties concerned with regard to the implementation of resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978) and report thereon. Measures relating to the streamlining of UNIFIL by May 1996 were welcomed including provisions to achieve further savings but noting that the operational capacity of the Force would not be affected. == See also == * List of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1001 to 1100 (1995\u20131997) * South Lebanon conflict (1985\u20132000) ==References== ==External links== * *Text of the Resolution at undocs.org 1039 1039 1039 Category:South Lebanon conflict (1985\u20132000) Category:1996 in Israel Category:1996 in Lebanon Category:January 1996 events ",
