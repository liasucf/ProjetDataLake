That is, it is defined as the number :\\begin{align}\\zeta(3) &= \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{n^3} \\\\\\&= \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}\\left(\\frac{1}{1^3} + \\frac{1}{2^3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n^3}\\right)\\end{align} where is the Riemann zeta function. It has an approximate value of : . The constant is named after Roger Ap\u00e9ry. It arises naturally in a number of physical problems, including in the second- and third-order terms of the electron's gyromagnetic ratio using quantum electrodynamics. It also arises in the analysis of random minimum spanning trees and in conjunction with the gamma function when solving certain integrals involving exponential functions in a quotient which appear occasionally in physics, for instance when evaluating the two-dimensional case of the Debye model and the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law. ==Irrational number== was named Ap\u00e9ry's constant after the French mathematician Roger Ap\u00e9ry, who proved in 1978 that it is an irrational number. This result is known as Ap\u00e9ry's theorem. The original proof is complex and hard to grasp, and simpler proofs were found later.; . Beukers's simplified irrationality proof involves approximating the integrand of the known triple integral for \\zeta(3), :\\zeta(3) = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{1-xyz}\\, dx\\, dy\\, dz, by the Legendre polynomials. In particular, van der Poorten's article chronicles this approach by noting that :I_3 := -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 \\frac{P_n(x) P_n(y) \\log(xy)}{1-xy}\\, dx\\, dy = b_n \\zeta(3) - a_n, where |I| \\leq \\zeta(3) (1-\\sqrt{2})^{4n}, P_n(z) are the Legendre polynomials, and the subsequences b_n, 2 \\operatorname{lcm}(1,2,\\ldots,n) \\cdot a_n \\in \\mathbb{Z} are integers or almost integers. It is still not known whether Ap\u00e9ry's constant is transcendental. ==Series representations== ===Classical=== In addition to the fundamental series: :\\zeta(3)=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}, Leonhard Euler gave the series representation: :\\zeta(3)=\\frac{\\pi^2}{7} \\left( 1-4\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac {\\zeta (2k)} {2^{2k}(2k+1)(2k+2)} \\right) in 1772, which was subsequently rediscovered several times. Other classical series representations include: :\\begin{align} \\zeta(3) &= \\frac{8}{7} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(2k+1)^3} \\\\\\ \\zeta(3) &= \\frac{4}{3} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k}{(k+1)^3} \\end{align} ===Fast convergence=== Since the 19th century, a number of mathematicians have found convergence acceleration series for calculating decimal places of . Since the 1990s, this search has focused on computationally efficient series with fast convergence rates (see section \"Known digits\"). The following series representation was found by A. A. Markov in 1890, rediscovered by Hjortnaes in 1953, and rediscovered once more and widely advertised by Ap\u00e9ry in 1979: :\\zeta(3) = \\frac{5}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k-1} \\frac{k!^2}{(2k)!k^3} The following series representation gives (asymptotically) 1.43 new correct decimal places per term: :\\zeta(3) = \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k-1} \\frac{(k-1)!^3(56k^2 - 32k + 5)}{(2k-1)^2(3k)!} The following series representation gives (asymptotically) 3.01 new correct decimal places per term: :\\zeta(3) = \\frac{1}{64} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k \\frac{k!^{10}(205k^2 + 250k + 77)}{(2k+1)!^5} The following series representation gives (asymptotically) 5.04 new correct decimal places per term:; . In his message to Simon Plouffe, Sebastian Wedeniwski states that he derived this formula from . The discovery year (1998) is mentioned in Simon Plouffe's Table of Records (8 April 2001). :\\zeta(3) = \\frac{1}{24} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k \\frac{(2k+1)!^3(2k)!^3k!^3(126392k^5 + 412708k^4 + 531578k^3 + 336367k^2 + 104000k + 12463)}{(3k+2)!(4k+3)!^3} It has been used to calculate Ap\u00e9ry's constant with several million correct decimal places.; . The following series representation gives (asymptotically) 3.92 new correct decimal places per term: :\\zeta(3) = \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^k(2k)!^3(k+1)!^6(40885k^5 + 124346k^4 + 150160k^3 + 89888k^2 + 26629k + 3116)}{(k+1)^2(3k+3)!^4} ===Digit by digit=== In 1998, Broadhurst gave a series representation that allows arbitrary binary digits to be computed, and thus, for the constant to be obtained in nearly linear time, and logarithmic space. ===Others=== The following series representation was found by Ramanujan:. :\\zeta(3)=\\frac{7}{180}\\pi^3 -2 \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3 (e^{2\\pi k} -1)} The following series representation was found by Simon Plouffe in 1998: :\\zeta(3)= 14 \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3 \\sinh(\\pi k)}-\\frac{11}{2}\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3 (e^{2\\pi k} -1)}-\\frac{7}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3 (e^{2\\pi k} +1)}. collected many series that converge to Ap\u00e9ry's constant. ==Integral representations== There are numerous integral representations for Ap\u00e9ry's constant. Some of them are simple, others are more complicated. ===Simple formulas=== For example, this one follows from the summation representation for Ap\u00e9ry's constant: :\\zeta(3) =\\int_0^1\\\\!\\\\! \\int_0^1\\\\!\\\\! \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{1-xyz}\\, dx\\,dy\\,dz . The next two follow directly from the well-known integral formulas for the Riemann zeta function: :\\zeta(3) =\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^2}{e^x-1}\\, dx and :\\zeta(3) =\\frac{2}{3}\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^2}{e^x+1}\\, dx . This one follows from a Taylor expansion of about , where is the Legendre chi function: :\\zeta(3) =\\frac{4}{7}\\int_0^\\frac{\\pi}{2} x \\log{(\\sec{x}+\\tan{x})}\\, dx Note the similarity to :G =\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\log{(\\sec{x}+\\tan{x})}\\, dx where is Catalan's constant. ===More complicated formulas=== Other formulas include: :\\zeta(3)=\\pi\\\\!\\\\!\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\\\! \\frac{\\cos(2\\arctan{x})}{\\left(x^2+1\\right)\\left(\\cosh\\frac{1}{2}\\pi x\\right)^2}\\, dx, and, :\\zeta(3) =-\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^1 \\\\!\\\\!\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\log(xy)}{\\,1-xy\\,}\\, dx \\, dy = -\\int_0^1 \\\\!\\\\!\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\log(1-xy)}{\\,xy\\,}\\, dx \\, dy, Mixing these two formulas, one can obtain : :\\zeta(3) =\\int_0^1 \\\\!\\\\! \\frac{\\log(x)\\log(1-x)}{\\,x\\,}\\, dx , By symmetry, :\\zeta(3) =\\int_0^1 \\\\!\\\\! \\frac{\\log(x)\\log(1-x)}{\\,1-x\\,}\\, dx , Summing both, \\zeta(3) =\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^1 \\\\!\\\\! \\frac{\\log(x)\\log(1-x)}{\\,x(1-x)\\,}\\, dx . Also, :\\begin{align} \\zeta(3) &= \\frac{8\\pi^2}{7}\\\\!\\\\!\\int_0^1 \\\\! \\frac{x\\left(x^4-4x^2+1\\right)\\log\\log\\frac{1}{x}}{\\,(1+x^2)^4\\,}\\, dx \\\\\\&= \\frac{8\\pi^2}{7}\\\\!\\\\!\\int_1^\\infty \\\\!\\frac{x\\left(x^4-4x^2+1\\right)\\log\\log{x}}{\\,(1+x^2)^4\\,}\\, dx\\end{align}. A connection to the derivatives of the gamma function :\\zeta(3) = -\\tfrac{1}{2}\\Gamma'(1)+\\tfrac{3}{2}\\Gamma'(1)\\Gamma(1)- \\big(\\Gamma'(1)\\big)^3 = -\\tfrac{1}{2} \\, \\psi^{(2)}(1) is also very useful for the derivation of various integral representations via the known integral formulas for the gamma and polygamma-functions. ==Known digits== The number of known digits of Ap\u00e9ry's constant has increased dramatically during the last decades. This is due both to the increasing performance of computers and to algorithmic improvements. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\" |+ Number of known decimal digits of Ap\u00e9ry's constant !
