Many gags parody events in Rocky, but also make reference to other films such as The Godfather. ==Plot== A down on his luck male stripper and gigolo, Ricky Wanero, trains to become a boxing champion and take on the Silver Shadow. ==Cast== *Michael Michaud as Ricky *Maggie Hughes as Annie *Hawthorne James as The Champ/Silver Shadow *Lane Montano as Vinnie *Peter Zellers as Leon / Patton *Jimmy Williams as Cutman / The Hitman / Arnie / Manny the Fighter *Brent Beckett as Brutal Bruce *Lloyd Haslip as Bruce's Manager ==Production== According to TV Guide, the film was shot in 1983, but shelved until 1988. ==Reception== The film remained mostly obscure, until internet personality and filmmaker James Rolfe (best known for the Angry Video Game Nerd webseries) reviewed it as part of his mock feud with Doug Walker (Nostalgia Critic) in 2008. He panned the film for its subpar attempts at clever humor, poor plot and nonsensical references that had nothing to do with the Rocky films. ==References== ==External links== * Ricky 1 at the Internet Movie Database * Ricky 1 at Rotten Tomatoes Category:American parody films Category:American films Category:American sports comedy films Category:American boxing films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Joel Goldsmith Category:1988 films Category:1980s sports films Category:1980s parody films Category:1988 comedy films ",
