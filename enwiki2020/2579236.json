    "text": "The 89th Grey Cup (Canadian Football League championship) was held in 2001 in Montreal. The Calgary Stampeders claimed their fifth championship in team history with a 27\u201319 win over the East Division champions and heavily favoured Winnipeg Blue Bombers. ==Game summary== Calgary Stampeders (27) \u2013 TD's, Marc Boerigter, Travis Moore, Willie Fells; FG's, Mark McLoughlin (2); cons., McLoughlin (3).

But Calgary rallied, saving their season with an 8\u201310 record, good for a second-place finish in the West Division. The Stampeders secured their berth in the Grey Cup with playoff victories over B.C. and Edmonton. Calgary's opponent was a strong Winnipeg Blue Bombers club which had the CFL's best regular season record of 14\u20134. But it was clear regular season play didn't matter as the Stampeders built a 17\u20134 lead at halftime. Trailing 4\u20133 late in the second quarter, Calgary quarterback Marcus Crandell hit a streaking Marc Boerigter down the left hash marks for a 68-yard touchdown. The Stampeders struck again before intermission when Calgary flooded the right side with receivers and Crandell hit Travis Moore for a nine-yard score. It seemed to be the wake-up call the Blue Bombers needed. On their first possession of the second half, quarterback Khari Jones hit Arland Bruce III for a 23-yard touchdown completion. But the turning point came at 5:37 of the fourth quarter. With the Blue Bombers trailing 17\u201312, Calgary's Aldi Henry -- playing the game in his hometown -- blocked Bob Cameron's punt attempt. Willie Fells recovered the ball and ran 11 yards for a Calgary touchdown. The Blue Bombers fought back, as Jones hit Milt Stegall who made a remarkable 23-yard touchdown reception. But once again the Stampeders pulled further ahead. Stuck on the Calgary 11 with time ticking down, Crandell threw to running back Kelvin Anderson on a sideline pattern. Anderson slipped past Marvin Coleman for a 44-yard gain. Three plays later, Mark McLoughlin kicked a 24-yard field goal. There was one final comeback attempt by Winnipeg. With the Blue Bombers on the Calgary 36 with time running out, Jones was driven by Stampeders defensive tackle Joe Fleming into the turf for a game-ending sack. It was a game of missed opportunity for the Blue Bombers, who repeatedly got near or into Calgary territory and came away empty handed. Winnipeg kicker Troy Westwood missed three of four field goal attempts. ==Trivia== * The attendance of 65,255 at Montreal's Olympic Stadium was the third-largest crowd to witness a Grey Cup. * The Calgary Stampeders became the second team (and second consecutive team) with a losing regular season record to win the Grey Cup. ==2001 CFL playoffs== ===West Division=== Semi-final (November 11 @ Calgary, Alberta) Calgary Stampeders 28\u201319 BC Lions Final (November 18 @ Edmonton, Alberta) Edmonton Eskimos 16\u201334 Calgary Stampeders ===East Division=== Semi- final (November 11 @ Hamilton, Ontario) Hamilton Tiger-Cats 24\u201312 Montreal Alouettes Final (November 18 @ Winnipeg, Manitoba) Winnipeg Blue Bombers 28\u201313 Hamilton Tiger-Cats ==External links== * Grey Cup Grey Cup Category:Grey Cup Category:Grey Cups hosted in Montreal Category:Winnipeg Blue Bombers Category:Calgary Stampeders Category:2000s in Montreal Category:2001 in Quebec Category:2001 in Canadian television Category:November 2001 sports events in Canada ",
