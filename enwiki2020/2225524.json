The Federation was created late in 1934 by the decision of the Supreme Council of Physical Culture of the USSR (, VSFK) as its sports section governing specifically football. It was the only organization that obtained recognition of FIFA in 1946. ==History== After the establishment of the Soviet regime in the former Russian Empire all its former affiliations abroad were discontinued. Football life in the country however did not stop. In July 1920 the first championship of the Russian SFSR took place, won by the collective city team of Moscow. In September 1923 the first championship of the Soviet Union took place which was won also by the Moscow team. In August 1928 the first Spartakiad took place in Moscow (not to be confused with the Spartakiad of Peoples of the USSR) which included a football tournament. On 27 May 1934, the \"Distinguished Master of Sports\" achievement award was established, and given to eight footballers that same year. On 27 December 1934, the All-Union Council of Physical Culture (VSFK) of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union (TsIK USSR) established a special public organization \u2013 the Football Section of the USSR \u2013 to take charge of football events in the country. In addition, there was also the Football Directorate of the Soviet Sports Committee, subordinated directly to the Soviet government. ===First memorable exhibition games=== On 30 August 1935 the national team of the Ukrainian SSR beat Red Star Olympique (from France) 6:1.

On 22 July 1937 for the first time TsIK USSR given awards to 38 best Soviet sportsmen among which were 12 football players. The first recipient of Order of Lenin among football players became Nikolai Starostin. The Order of the Red Banner of Labour received Alexander Starostin and Sergei Ilyin, other nine players received Order of the Badge of Honor. During World War II (1941\u20131944) the main football events were suspended, but there were several regional competitions. When the Soviet Union was liberated from the occupation of Nazi Germany in August 1944 the next national cup competition took place as the first official post-war football event. In July 1946 the Football Section of the USSR was admitted to FIFA on the proposition of delegates from Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia and on 27 September 1947 the USSR was awarded a permanent seat of the vice-president of FIFA which was taken by Valentin Granatkin. The main national football team of the Soviet Union however did not compete at the FIFA World Cup until 1958. The first coach appointed was Boris Arkadiev who in 1952 led the team to the Olympic games in Helsinki. He later along with several other football specialist was accused of sabotaging the team that was eliminated in the tournament's Round of 16. In January 1957 the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR awarded the Order of Lenin to Vsevolod Bobrov and Lev Yashin to commemorate their achievements in sport. In May 1959 the Football Section of the USSR was reorganized as the Football Federation of the USSR. In 1960 the national team of the Soviet Union won the first continental championship beating the national team of Yugoslavia 2:1 in extra time. In 1963 Lev Yashin became the first Soviet player to be awarded the Ballon d'Or. For the first time in 1965\u201366 season the Soviet football clubs debuted in the European international football competitions. In 1972 the Football Federation of the USSR became a government agency of the State Committee of Sports (Goskomsport). However, because Granatkin continued to chair the Football Federation, that reorganization did not drew much attention from FIFA.Football of double subordination Dynamo Kyiv became the first Soviet club to win a European club trophy, when they defeated Ferencvaros 3\u20130 in the 1975 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final. In 1988 Lev Yashin received the golden order of FIFA \"For service\" and in March 1990 was recognized as the Hero of Socialist Labour. Next month the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet awarded the Hero of Socialist Labour to Nikolai Starostin as well. On 8 February 1992 the federation was recognized as the parent association of the newly established Russian Football Union (RFS).
