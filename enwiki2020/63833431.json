    "text": "Floris J. Visser (c.1881 - 11 August 1901) was an Afrikaner and member of the Letaba Commando, which fought for the Republic of Transvaal during the Second Anglo-Boer War. Visser's summary execution while a wounded prisoner of war was one of the alleged British war crimes that were prosecuted in the Court martial of Breaker Morant. At the time of his death, Visser was about twenty years of age. Leach (2012), The Legend of Breaker Morant is Dead and Buried, Louis Trichardt, page 53. ==Capture== On the night of August 6, 1901, Floris Visser was wounded in his ankle during an ambush of his Boer Commando by a patrol of the Bushveldt Carbineers, an irregular unit of the British Army, led by Captain Percy Frederick Hunt. The ambush took place at the Viljoen homestead in Duivelskloof. During the same attack, the Commando lost Field cornet Barend Viljoen, his brother J.J. Viljoen, and F.J. Schell. The Bushveldt Carbineers lost Captain Hunt and Sergeant Frank Eland.Leach (2012), pages 40-48. After the ambush, the remnant of the Letaba Commando was pursued by a BVC patrol led by Lieut. Harry Morant, who was outraged by the death of his friend Captain Hunt. Although Morant had only arrived from Fort Edward after Captain Hunt's burial, he had been told rumors that Hunt's body had been mutilated. Leach (2012), page 52-53. On the morning of August 9, 1901, Morant led a patrol consisting of both members of the Bushveldt Carbineers and warriors from the local Lobedu people. That evening, after coming upon the Letaba Commando's encampment in a gully, the patrol prepared to attack. Morant's Afrikaner adjutant, Trooper Theunis Botha, later recalled, \"I may say here that for Morant's own cowardice the whole of the party would have been caught as every other man in the patrol will testify. Instead of going close up as he could easily have done and so closing the cordon he started firing at 2000 yards and would not go nearer.\" Leach (2012), page 53-55. Hearing the shots, the Letaba Commando scattered. As his comrades fled, Visser, who was unable to walk or ride was left behind. The Bushveldt Carbineers found him lying under one of the wagons. Leach (2012), page 53. Trooper Botha later recalled, \"I generally acted as interpreter for Lt Morant. On the evening on which Visser was captured I acted in that capacity. I asked Visser by Lieutenant Morant's request how Capt. Hunt was killed. He replied that he was killed in a fair fight, shot through the chest. Lieutenant Morant said his neck was broken. Visser vehemently denied it. Before commencing to ask these questions Lieutenant Morant said, 'If you tell the truth your life will be spared, if you tell lies you will be shot.' He then asked as to the plans of the Boers. Visser replied that the Boers did not intend to stay around there (Little Letaba) but we're trekking to the Woodbush to join Beyers' Commando.\" Leach (2012), page 54. As the patrol continued their pursuit of the Viljoen Commando, Visser was carried along. Trooper Botha continues, \"In the morning similar questions were again asked him by Lieutenant Morant who again promised to spare his life if he answered truthfully. Visser answered every question truthfully as subsequent events proved.\" Leach (2012), page 55. ==Death== According to BVC Trooper Edward Powell, \"After being captured he was conveyed in a cape cart about fifteen miles. When we outspanned I heard that Lieutenants Morant, Handcock, and Picton would hold a court-martial and that Visser would probably be shot. Visser was in the cart all the time to the best of my belief and was not present at the court-martial.\" Leach (2012), page 55. According to Trooper Botha, \"When [Henry] Ledeboer told Visser he was about to be shot I heard Visser remind Lieutenant Morant through the interpreter that he had promised to spare his life if he had answered all his questions. Lieutenant Morant said, 'It is idle talk. We are going to shoot you,' or word to that effect.\" Leach (2012), page 55. According to Trooper James Christie, a New Zealander, when Morant order the patrol to form a firing squad, the men objected and one of the Lieutenants shouted, \"If you're so damn chicken- hearted I'll shoot him myself.\" Leach (2012), page 56. Before taking his place in the firing squad, Trooper Botha told Trooper Christie about Visser, \"I know him good. I went to school with him. I don't like to do it, but they will shoot me if I don't.\" Leach (2012), page 56. The squad consisted of BVC Troopers A.J. Petrie, J.J. Gill, Wild, and T.J. Botha. Trooper Christie watched as the Lobedu lifted Visser out of the cape cart in a blanket and laid him down twenty yard away in a sitting position with his back to the firing squad. Leach (2012), page 56. Trooper Powell further alleged that the Lobedu danced \"the war dance before Visser before he was shot.\" Leach (2012), page 55. A volley rang out and Visser fell backwards from his sitting position. A coup de grace was delivered by BVC Lt. Harry Picton. Leach (2012), page 56. Lieutenant Morant then approached Trooper Christie and said, \"I know it's hard times for him, but it's got to be done, see how the Boers knocked Captain Hunt about.\" Leach (2012), page 56. According to Trooper Christie, \"I said that Captain Hunt had died a soldier's death - that he was killed in a 'fair go' and beyond being stripped there was no maltreatment of him; and how the Kaffirs might have stripped him. He said no; that Captain Hunt's tunic and trousers had been found in the Cape cart. 'But,' I said, 'the boy was not wearing them.' 'Anyhow,' he said, 'its got to be done. It's unfortunate that he should be the first to suffer.' I still held that it was not right to shoot him after carrying him for so far. But as up to this time Morant and I had been good friends I said no more, but tore off my 'B.V.C.' badge and cursed such a form of soldiering. Then we saddled up and trekked for home.\" Leach (2012), page 56. On the orders of the officers, Visser was buried by the Lobedu in a shallow grave near Blas Perreira's Shop along the Koedoes River. Leach (2012), page 56-57. ==Legacy== Even though Visser had revealed information that placed his comrades at risk, his name was posthumously added to the Zoutpansberg Commando's Roll of Honour. Leach (2012), page 48. Visser's name does not appear, however, at the Heroes Acre Monument in Duivelskloof, which lists the names of all local Afrikaners who were killed during the Second Anglo-Boer War. He has, however been added to the monument to civilian casualties at Fort Edward, the monument at Blas Perreira's Store, and on the monument at the Viljoen family homestead. Leach (2012), page 53, footnote. Despite more than a century of efforts by the South African Government and by local residents to find and mark his grave, the location of Visser's burial remains a mystery.Leach (2012), The Legend of Breaker Morant is Dead and Buried, pp. 35\u201360, 100. ==References== Category:1881 births Category:1901 deaths Category:1901 in the South African Republic Category:Afrikaner people Category:British war crimes Category:Deaths by firearm in South Africa Category:Extrajudicial killings in South Africa Category:Military personnel killed in the Second Boer War Category:People murdered in South Africa Category:People of the Second Boer War Category:Second Boer War crimes Category:Second Boer War prisoners of war held by the United Kingdom Category:South African murder victims Category:South African Republic military personnel of the Second Boer War ",
