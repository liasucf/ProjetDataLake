Retrieved June 28, 2006. SEAS is one of 12 schools and colleges at the University of Virginia. The school currently has 2,861 undergraduate and 1,057 on-Grounds graduate students.Facts and Stats. https://engineering.virginia.edu/about/facts-and- stats. Retrieved November 22, 2019. There are 264 faculty with research and/or teaching roles. ==History== Thornton Hall, the long-time home of the SEAS In 1836, the Board of Visitors made civil engineering a formal course of study at the University of Virginia. The board was responding to the needs of a nation embracing the Industrial Revolution. The U.S. required engineers to build machinery for its factories, bridges for its turnpikes and locks for its canals. The University created the course of study to prepare young people to take on these challenges. At the time, there were just three institutions of higher learning in the U.S. wholly devoted to engineering instruction. With its 1836 resolution, the University of Virginia became the first enduring engineering program established in the South and the first in the nation at a comprehensive university. Wilsdorf Hall A department of mechanical engineering was added in 1892; electrical in 1897; chemical engineering in 1908; English in 1936; aeronautical and nuclear engineering in 1956; materials science, biomedical, applied math, computer science and systems engineering in 1963-74. A master's degree was first offered in 1948; a doctoral degree was first offered in 1955. Distance education offerings began in 1983 and the Center for Diversity in Engineering was launched in 1990. In 2012, the Engineering School established the Department of Engineering and Society (E&S;). Along with providing many of the foundational courses in the School's curriculum, E&S; is responsible for the following programs for undergraduates: the undergraduate thesis, the engineering business minor, the Washington, D.C. Science and Technology Policy Internship, Rodman Scholars, international studies, online courses, and hands-on activities such as the electric vehicle project. Markings along Engineer's Way Starting in 2015, a SEAS team led by mechanical engineering professor Eric Loth began research into a UVA design of offshore wind turbines that would potentially dwarf the size and scope of any being produced or researched anywhere else.Palm Trees Inspire UVA Team's Revolutionary Design of Offshore Wind Turbines, accessed April 30, 2019 The innovative design inspired by palm trees led to Roth being named to a Popular Science list of \u201cThe Brilliant Minds Behind The New Energy Revolution\u201d in June of that year.The Brilliant Minds Behind The New Energy Revolution: These Are The Faces of Change, accessed April 30, 2019Eric Loth Builds Smarter Wind Turbines, accessed April 30, 2019 In 2018 and 2019, SEAS teams consisting of computer science undergraduates twice won the Alamo Cup and repeat national championships at the National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition.University of Virginia Defends National Cyber Title, accessed April 30, 2019 This is the best known collegiate information security competition in the United States, and the University of Virginia won the 2019 competition over 235 competing universities. ==Special Scholars and Societies== ===Clark Scholars Program=== The A. James Clark Scholars Program was established in 2018 as the result of a $15 million gift from the A. James and Alice B. Clark Foundation in 2017. Clark Scholars are selected from underserved demographics for their academic excellence, track record of leadership, and commitment to community service. With an emphasis on cultivating business acumen in high-achieving engineers, the program provides scholars an opportunity to take special courses through the McIntire School of Commerce. Additional benefits for Clark Scholars include a semester of study abroad, priority registration, small section academic study, and scholarships. The inaugural cohort of 16, led in the 2018-2019 school year by Stephanie Gernentz, Joshua Sahaya Arul, and Rachel Zhang, entered in June 2018. ===Rodman Scholars Program=== Founded in 1979, the Rodman Scholars Program (named for Walter Sheldon Rodman, former professor and dean of the engineering school) consists of the top 5-6 percent of each class of engineering students. There are many benefits for Rodman Scholars, which include living in the honors dorms first year, exclusive versions of common first-year courses, and priority registration. While most are selected automatically by the admissions office, some may apply during their first semester. Rodmans are expected to maintain at least a 3.0 GPA throughout their academic career. === The Society of P.R.I. === One of the many secret societies at U.Va., The Society of P.R.I. is exclusive to the SEAS community. It is known for honoring faculty, staff, and students for exceptional service to their respective communities. ==Departments and Degree Programs== There are eight departments home to eleven degree programs. *Biomedical Engineering *Chemical Engineering *Computer Science *Electrical and Computer Engineering *Engineering and Society *Engineering Systems and Environment *Materials Science and Engineering *Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! !!
