It is based on the book of the same name written by Maria Jos\u00e9 Dupr\u00e9. The series is adapted by \u00c2ngela Chaves, with the collaboration of Bernardo Guilherme, Daisy Chaves and Juliana Peres. It stars Gl\u00f3ria Pires, Nicolas Prattes, Danilo Mesquita, Giullia Buscacio, Andr\u00e9 Luiz Frambach, Simone Spoladore, Ricardo Pereira and C\u00e1ssio Gabus Mendes in the main roles. == Plot == The story tells the life of a middle-class family from S\u00e3o Paulo between the 1920s and 1940s. Lola (Gl\u00f3ria Pires) is a kind woman dedicated to her family, is married to J\u00falio (Antonio Calloni), who aspires to be rich and was indebted to finance a house on Avenida Ang\u00e9lica, in S\u00e3o Paulo; they have four children together. The studious Carlos (Danilo Mesquita) is the pride of the family, but has a troubled romance with In\u00eas (Carol Macedo), whose mother is against the relationship. Alfredo (Nicolas Prattes) lives in conflict with his parents for his rebellious and riotous way, in addition to hating his older brother out of jealousy. The spoiled Isabel (Giullia Buscacio) shocks everyone when she gets involved with Fel\u00edcio (Paulo Rocha), a much older man. Julinho (Andr\u00e9 Luiz Frambach) dates Lili (Triz Pariz), but aims to rise socially, seeing this opportunity in the romance with Soraia (Rayssa Bratillieri), daughter of the rich Assad (Werner Sch\u00fcnemann), his father's boss. After her husband's premature death, Lola starts selling homemade sweets to support her family. Lola's paternal aunt, Em\u00edlia (Susana Vieira), is a bitter and millionaire widow who has never helped her family and lives taking care of her daughter, Justina (Julia Stockler), who has mental problems and cannot leave the house for this reason. Emilia sent her younger daughter, Adelaide (Joana de Verona), to Switzerland as a child, but she returns as an adult and conflicts with her mother over feminist ideas and the insistence that her sister should not be deprived of social life, in addition to being sexually open-minded and gets involved with her cousin Alfredo. The rest of Lola's family lives in Itapetininga: her mother Maria (Denise Weinberg), maternal aunt Candoca (Camila Amado) and sisters Clotilde (Simone Spoladore) and Olga (Maria Eduarda de Carvalho). Clotilde lives unhappily away from Almeida (Ricardo Pereira), with whom she broke up after discovering that he was divorced, for fear of judgment, although she hopes to take the courage to live love. Olga dreamed of becoming a member of high society, but she decided to marry her great love, Zeca (Eduardo Sterblitch), even though he is a humble pharmacist, articulating for her aunt Em\u00edlia to hire him to take care of her business, thus being well paid and giving herself a good life. Shirley (Barbara Reis) has always believed that she was abandoned while pregnant in her teens by Jo\u00e3o Aranha (Caco Ciocler), unaware that everything was a plan by his mother, and when she reunites with him more than ten years later, she discovers the truth. However, she is already married to Afonso (C\u00e1ssio Gabus Mendes), who cares for their daughter, In\u00eas, causing her to be torn between the love of the two, since Aranha starts to show himself as a possessive and different man from youth. Lola's best friend is the gossip Genu (Kelzy Ecard), married to the submissive Virgulino (Kiko Mascarenhas), with whom she has two children: Lili and L\u00facio (Jhona Burjack), in love with Isabel. == Cast == * Gl\u00f3ria Pires as Eleonora \"Lola\" Amaral de Lemos * Danilo Mesquita as Carlos Ab\u00edlio de Lemos * Nicolas Prattes as Alfredo Ab\u00edlio de Lemos * Giullia Buscacio as Isabel Ab\u00edlio de Lemos * Andr\u00e9 Luiz Frambach as J\u00falio \"Julinho\" Ab\u00edlio de Lemos Filho * C\u00e1ssio Gabus Mendes as Afonso dos Santos Oliveira * Simone Spoladore as Clotilde Amaral * Ricardo Pereira as Argemiro de Almeida * Joana de Verona as Adelaide Amaral Sampaio * Carol Macedo as In\u00eas Ferreira dos Santos * Paulo Rocha as Fel\u00edcio de Souza * Rayssa Bratillieri as Soraia Assad * Susana Vieira as Em\u00edlia Amaral Sampaio * Maria Eduarda de Carvalho as Olga Amaral Marcondes de Bueno * Eduardo Sterblitch as Jos\u00e9 Carlos \"Zeca\" Marcondes de Bueno * Julia Stockler as Justina Amaral Sampaio * B\u00e1rbara Reis as Shirley Ferreira * Nicola Siri as Os\u00f3rio Tavares * Marcela Jacobina as Nat\u00e1lia Tellman * Triz Pariz as Maria L\u00eddia \"Lili\" Coutinho * Jhona Burjack as L\u00facio Coutinho * Kelzy Ecard as Genu\u00edna \"Genu\" Coutinho * Kiko Mascarenhas as Virgulino Coutinho * Werner Sch\u00fcnemann as Jorge Assad * Mayana Neiva as Karine Fagundes Assad * Virg\u00ednia Rosa as Durvalina \"Durva\" da Silva * Camila Amado as C\u00e2ndida Amaral \"Tia Candoca\" * Denise Weinberg as Maria Amaral * Stepan Nercessian as Delegado Gusm\u00f5es * Brenno Leone as Elias Al-Fashi * Izak Dahora as Sebasti\u00e3o \"Ti\u00e3o\" * Guilherme Ferraz as Marcelo Gomes de Souza e Silva * Thiago Justino as Higino * Nilson Nunes as Alaor * Caroline Verban as Hermengarda / Nely * Duda Batista as Emily Amaral Marcondes de Bueno * Marjorie Queiroz as Emiliana Amaral Marcondes de Bueno * Andr\u00e9 Cidade as Ot\u00e1vio \"Tavinho\" Amaral Marcondes de Bueno * Noha Hamdan as Rita Almeida * Jo\u00e3o Vitor Manh\u00e3es as Ernesto Almeida === Guest cast === * Antonio Calloni as J\u00falio Ab\u00edlio de Lemos * Caco Ciocler as Jo\u00e3o Aranha * Luciana Braga as Zulmira de Souza * Irene Ravache as Tereza * Nicette Bruno as Madre Joana * Marcos Caruso as Prefeito Moys\u00e9s * Wagner Santisteban as Marcos * Walderez de Barros as Marlene de Lemos * Othon Bastos as Padre Ven\u00e2ncio * Emiliano Queiroz as Seu Isidoro * Lav\u00ednia Pannunzio as Lucy Assad * Ellen Rocche as Marion * Daniel Boaventura as Adoniran * Aline Borges as Dr\u00aa.
