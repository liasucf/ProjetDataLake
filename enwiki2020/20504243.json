She and her family arrived to Mexico in 1938 from Europe and she studied art at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \"La Esmeralda\", where she met and became friends with Frida Kahlo. She became the only female member of \u201cLos Fridos\u201d a group of students under Kahlo\u2019s tutelage. She also worked as an assistant and apprentice to Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros, painting a number of murals of her own during her career. The most significant of these is \"Ronda en el tiempo\" at the Museo Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda in Mexico City. She also created canvases and other works, with children often featured in her work, and was one of the first of her generation to work with ecological themes in a series of works begun in 1979. ==Life== Tec de Monterrey, Campus Ciudad de Monterrey Fanny Rabel was born Fanny Rabinovich on August 27, 1922 in Poland to a Polish-Jewish couple from a family of traveling actors. When she was a child, she could not have dolls, according to her daughter Paloma, so she drew the ones she saw in store windows. Her family was cultured with her sister Malka becoming a theatre critic. The family moved to Paris in 1929, where she first attended school. They then moved to Mexico in 1938. She entered the Escuela Nocturna para Trabajadores, where she took classes in drawing and engraving. Her anti-Nazi and anti-Fascism politics resulted in her participation in a mural called \"Retrato de la Burgues\u00eda\" in 1940 for the Sindicato Mexicano de Electricistas building on Alfonso Caso Street in Mexico City. Rabel met a group of exiled Spaniards in Mexico along with Antonio Pujol, who invited her to take part in a mural project headed by him, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Joseph Renau, Luis Arenal, Antonio Rodr\u00edguez Luna and Miguel Prieto. This work depicted, among other things, children killed by Nazi bombing in Spain. She entered the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \"La Esmeralda\" shortly after it was established in 1942, taking classes with Jos\u00e9 Ch\u00e1vez Morado, Feliciano Pe\u00f1a and Frida Kahlo, with whom she became close friends. (universal) . She also became one of Frida Kahlo\u2019s students at the Casa Azul, a group of four called \u201cLos Fridos\u201d (a play on Frida\u2019s name). She was the only female in this group, learning alongside Guillermo Monroy, Arturo Garc\u00eda Bustos and Arturo Estrada. Other teachers included Francisco Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Alfredo Zalce, Ra\u00fal Anguiano, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Carlos Orozco Romero and Diego Rivera. She changed her last name from Rabinovich to Rabel during her career. Rabel married urologist Jaime Woolrich and had two children Abel and Paloma Woolrich, both of whom became actors. She lived for decades in an apartment on Martinez de Castro Street in the San Miguel Chapultepec neighborhood in Mexico City. Near the end of her life she lost most of her memory, with Alzheimers suspected. She was almost evicted from her apartment at this time as it was deemed unsafe, but she continued living there until she died on November 25, 2008. Rabel was buried at the Pante\u00f3n Israelita. She was survived by her daughter Paloma and her grandchildren. ==Career== Rabel had her first exhibition of her work in 1945 with twenty four oils, thirteen drawings and eight engravings at the Liga Popular Israelita with Frida Kahlo writing the presentation. In 1955, she had an individual exhibition at the Sal\u00f3n de la Pl\u00e1stica Mexicana . She had a large exhibition at the museum of the Palacio de Bellas Artes to commemorate a half century of her work. Her last exhibition was in 2007 at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Metropolitana . Her work can be found in collections in over fifteen countries including those of the New York Public Library, the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., the Royal Academy of Denmark, the National Library in Paris, the Casa de las Am\u00e9ricas in Havana, the Benem\u00e9rita Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Puebla and the Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City. She is considered to be the first female muralist in Mexico. She was an assistant to Diego Rivera while he worked on the frescos for the National Palace and an apprentice to David Alfaro Siqueiros. Her most important mural is Ronda en el tiempo located in the Museo Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda, which was created from 1964 to 1965. She also created murals at the Unidad de Lavaderos P\u00fablico de Tepalcatitl\u00e1n (1945), Sobrevivencia, Alfabetizaci\u00f3n in Coyoac\u00e1n in 1952 Sobrevivencia de un pueblo at the Centro Deportivo Israelita (1957) Hacia la salud for the Hospital Infantil de M\u00e9xico (1982), La familia mexicana at the Registro P\u00fablico de la Propiedad (1984) (which Rabel preferred to title Abolici\u00f3n de la propiedad privada) and at the Imprenta Artgraf. In collaboration with other artists, she participated in the creation of the murals at the La Rosita pulque bar (disappeared) and at the Casa de la Madre Soltera. She was a member of the Sal\u00f3n de la Pl\u00e1stica Mexicana and the Taller de Gr\u00e1fica Popular, joining both in 1950. A group of her friends nominated her for the Premio Nacional de Arte but it was denied. However, her work has been honored with a number of retrospective exhibits before and after her death. In 2007, there was a retrospective of her work at the Festival de M\u00e9xico in the historic center of Mexico City at the House of the First Print Shop in the Americas with the title of La Fanny de los Fridos. Her work was featured at an exhibition called Fanny Rabel y Mujeres del Sal\u00f3n de la Pl\u00e1stica Mexicana held at the Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos Library . The Sal\u00f3n de la Pl\u00e1stica Mexicana had a retrospective of her work after he death called Retrospectiva in Memoriam, Fanny Rabel (1922-2008) held at the Museum of the Universidad Popular Aut\u00f3noma del Estado de Puebla . ==Artistry== Rabel is considered to be the first modern female muralist in Mexico although she also did significant work in painting, engraving, drawing and ceramic sculpture. Her work has been classified as poetic Surrealism, Neo-expressionism and is also considered part of the Escuela Mexicana de Pintura (the dominant art movement of the early to mid 20th century in Mexico) as one of the youngest muralists to be associated with it along with Arnold Belkin and Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez Delga . Rabel was more drawn to depicting mankind\u2019s pain rather than happiness, sharing other Mexican muralists' concerns about social injustice. However, she stated to Leopoldo M\u00e9ndez that she could not create combative works, with clenched fists and fierce faces, and she wanted to leave the Taller de Gr\u00e1fica Popular. M\u00e9ndez convinced her to stay, saying that more tender images are important to political struggle as well. Children with Mexican faces are common in her work, often with expressions between laughter and tears. They are generally poor children, meant to depict the socioeconomically marginalized populations in the country. However, she did not paint outright tragedy or tears. In many of her works, the different social classes of Mexico are contrasted, often with indigenous peoples. The gentleness of her works, she insisted was \u201cfor the revolution.\u201d She also did one portrait of Frida Kahlo, a pencil drawing which was first exhibited near the end of her life. She was economically prosperous, something which bothered her as she worried about exploiting the poor for art. Unlike artists who avoided the news and popular culture as to not poorly influence their art, Rabel attended concerts, listened to the radio and was a fan of film from both Mexico and Hollywood. She was one of the first of her generation to develop themes related to ecology, the changes in Mexico City, against technocracy and emphasis on commerce. She began a series of paintings in 1979 called \u201cR\u00e9quiem por una ciudad\u201d depicting what she considered to be the destruction of Mexico City by smog, traffic and garbage. The works include: \"Di\u00e1logo capitalino,\" \"Muerte citadina,\" \"Los peatones van al cielo,\" \"El profundo drenaje,\" \"La rebeli\u00f3n de los peatones\" and \"M\u00e9xico, D.F.\" \"R\u00e9quiem para una ciudad\" in 1979 considers three themes: the lack of human communication, the traffic, and pollution of the air and ground. \"La rebeli\u00f3n de los peatones\" in 1987 expresses a worry about the excess of cars in the city. == References == *Artspawn. \"Biography of Fanny Rabel\", Biographical information about Fanny Rabel on Artspawn.
