It was released in 1948. ==Plot== In ruined Berlin, several bands of abandoned children roam the streets, engaging in petty crimes. When a circus arrives nearby, the boys are charmed by one Trapeze performer called Corona. They are upset when the circus' manager insults her, and plan a revenge by setting a trap on the ring. But their scheme fails and it is Corona that is injured. Being unable to work, she is dismissed. The boys tend to her, and as time passes, she teaches them her art, and they form a little circus of their own. A manager of another circus offers Corona a job. She is reluctant to leave the children. Eventually, the manager takes them all in into his circus. ==Cast== * Eva Ingeborg Scholz as Corona * Lutz Moik as Gerhard Wittmann * Piet Clausen as Dietrich * Ralph Siewert as Fritzchen * Walter Werner as Doctor Waldner * Annemarie Hase as Frau Schmittchen * Herbert H\u00fcbner as Professor Hanke * Hans- Edgar Stecher as Heinz * Horst Gentzen as Emil * Werner M\u00fcller as Carl * Hans Neie as Rudi * Eduard Wandrey as Hugo Grandini * Hans Leibelt as Circus Manager Barlay ==Production== The script writers were inspired by a real children's circus, Rose, that was a popular attraction in the city of P\u00f6\u00dfneck during the first post-war years.\"Kino P\u00f6\u00dfneck: Wie aus Rose 1-2-3 Corona wurde.\" Th\u00fcringer Allgemeine. 30 April 2010. 1-2-3 Corona was the first DEFA picture to be filmed in UFA's old studio in Potsdam-Babelsberg, which was turned into the DEFA Feature Films Studio.
