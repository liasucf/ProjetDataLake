It is located at the former Woodford Aerodrome, and it replaces the former Avro Heritage Centre. ==History== ===Avro Heritage Centre=== Originally opened as the Avro Heritage Centre in Woodford's personnel block, the centre had five rooms with displays and photos about Avro, an archive, and a small shop. It was only open for tours on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and visits were only possible by prior appointment. ===Avro Heritage Museum=== As part of the deal to sell Woodford Aerodrome for redevelopment in December 2011, BAE agreed to fund the renovation of the former aerodrome fire station to become the new Avro Heritage Museum. Designed to replace the previous heritage centre, the work was carried out by Conlon Construction and Cassidy + Ashton. Plans were submitted in February 2014; planning permission was approved on 20 May; construction started in August; and the museum opened 13 November 2015. At , the new building is 70% larger than the previous centre and includes an exhibition hall, a gallery, a cafe, reading rooms, and classrooms. It holds the Avro Heritage Trust's collection of over 30,000 artefacts on aircraft development, including a set of murals that used to be located in Woodford's employee restaurant. ==Aircraft on display== * Avro Vulcan B.2 XM603 * Avro Type F \u2013 Replica * Roe I Triplane \u2013 Replica ===Cockpits=== * Avro Anson XIX G-AGPG * Avro Lancaster B.I R5868 \"S for Sugar\" \u2013 replica * English Electric Canberra WK118 * Hawker Siddeley 748 1756 * Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR.2 XV235 * Vickers VC10 C1K XV106 \u2013 on loan ==See also== *List of aerospace museums ==References== ==External links== * Avro Heritage Museum Category:2015 establishments in England Category:Museums established in 2015 Category:History museums in Greater Manchester Category:Aerospace museums in England Category:Tourist attractions in the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport Category:Buildings and structures in the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport Category:Proposed museums in the United Kingdom Category:BAE Systems ",
