    "text": "Antaresia is a genus of pythons, nonvenomous snakes found in Australia. The genus is known by the common name Children's pythons, the name of the type species. Gray named it in honour of his mentor, John George Children, who was a curator of the zoological collection at the British Museum around that time. It contains the smallest members of the Pythonidae. Currently, four species are recognized, although they were all considered part of the same species until recently. ==Geographic range== The species are found in Australia in arid and tropical regions. ==Species== {|cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\" !bgcolor=\"#f0f0f0\"|Species !bgcolor=\"#f0f0f0\"|Taxon author !bgcolor=\"#f0f0f0\"|Common name !bgcolor=\"#f0f0f0\"|Geographic range |- |A. childreniT 150px |(Gray, 1842) |Children's python |style=\"width:40%\"|Australia in the extreme north of Western Australia, the northern third of Northern Territory, and northeastern Queensland, and on the islands of the Torres Strait |- |A. maculosa 150px |(Peters, 1873) |Spotted python |Australia from the extreme north of the Cape York Peninsula, south through eastern Queensland to northern New South Wales, and on many islands off the coast of Queensland |- |A. perthensis 150px |(Stull, 1932) |Pygmy python |Australia in the northwest of Western Australia, including some coastal islands |- |A. stimsoni 150px |(L.A.

T) Type species. ==Taxonomy== The name is taken from the star Antares in the constellation Scorpius. The genus name was created in 1984 by Wells and Wellington in a revision of Children's pythons, those previously described as a single species in the genus Liasis. Despite a petition to suppress the taxonomic work of these authors, it gained wide acceptance and publication in 1991. Four species are currently recognized in the genus Antaresia, which is contained by the family Pythonidae; infraspecific ranks have also been described. A subspecies, A. stimsoni orientalis was described by L.A. Smith (1985), but was not recognized as valid by Barker & Barker (1994). ==References== ==External links== * Antaresia.com.
