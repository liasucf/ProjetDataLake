    "text": "Black Dog (17801848), Manka-Chonka in Osage, became a notable chief of a band of the Osage Nation when they lived in what is now northeastern Oklahoma. He is credited with having his band improve a trail from southeastern Kansas to the Great Salt Plains in present-day Alfalfa County, Oklahoma, to be used in seasonal migrations to summer hunting grounds. He is believed to have been given this name after fighting well as a young man against the Comanche. Manka-Chonka married and had one son (1827-1910). He was also called Black Dog and became a chief among the Osage in 1870. Chief Black Dog painted by George Catlin ca. 1843. ==Early life== Black Dog I was born in 1780 near the Mississippi River and the site of the present-day city of St. Louis, Missouri. His birth name was Zhin-gawa-ca (or Shinka-Wah-Sa), meant Dark Eagle or Sacred Little One. About 1802 his people migrated and settled in the northeastern part of the present state of Oklahoma. His band set up a village they named Pasuga (Big Cedar), located on an ancient earthwork mound built by an earlier indigenous culture. After fighting well as a young warrior against the raiding Comanche in that region, Zhin-gawa-ca was given a new name, Manka-Chonka, meaning Black Dog. It was customary for the Osage to be given new names to reflect such major passages in life.Self, Burl E. \"Black Dog (ca. 1780 - 1848),\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Accessed July 20, 2016. ==Chief== Black Dog was a contemporary of, and shared power in the tribe with, two other noted chiefs: Clermont (Claremore) and Pawhuska. Osage men were typically described as very tall and physically well-built. Black Dog was apparently even more imposing than most, since he was described as nearly tall and weighing at least . He was reportedly blind in his left eye. He is believed to have led one of the larger bands. His men completed what became known as the Black Dog Trail by 1803. It started from their winter territory east of Baxter Springs in Kansas and extended southwest to their summer hunting grounds at the Great Salt Plains in present-day Alfalfa County, Oklahoma.Burl E. Self, \"Black Dog\" , Oklahoma Encyclopedia of History and Culture, accessed 5 Nov 2009 The Osage regularly stopped at the springs for healing on their way to summer hunting grounds. They made the trail by clearing it of brush and large rocks, and constructing earthen ramps to the fords. Wide enough for eight horsemen to ride abreast, the trail was the first improved road in Kansas and Oklahoma.Louis F. Burns, \"Osage\" , Oklahoma Encyclopedia of History and Culture, accessed 5 Nov 2009 The band had a village known as Pasuga, \"Big Cedar\", built on an earthwork mound near what later developed as Claremore, Oklahoma. Osage tradition credits Black Dog I with having constructed a cave near his village on Claremore Mound. The cave was large enough to conceal the nearly 500 members of his band and they stocked it with enough food to survive for a year. The cave later provided a hiding place for the remaining residents of Pasuga to escape being massacred by during the so-called Battle of Claremore Mound in 1817.Tracy Phillips, \"Chief Black Dog \u2013 The Builder\", Kansas Mediocrity blog, 31 July 2011; Accessed July 24, 2016. Black Dog I had one son, known as an adult as Black Dog II (1827-1910). He later became a chief among the Osage. Many sources refer to the father as Black Dog I and the son as Black Dog II. The son reportedly became chief in 1870.Smithsonian American Art Museum, Pre-1877 Art Exhibition Catalogue, Index, Artist: Stanley, John Mix.
