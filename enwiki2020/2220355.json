    "text": "The Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest (, ) is a Roman Catholic society of apostolic life of pontifical right in communion with the Holy See of the Catholic Church. The institute has the stated goal of honoring God and the sanctification of priests in the service of the Catholic Church and souls. An integral part of the institute\u2019s charism is the use of the traditional Latin liturgy of 1962 for Mass and the other sacraments. It has undertaken the restoration of a number of historic church buildings. The institute's rule of life is based generally on that of the secular canons. Its stated mission is the defense and propagation of the reign of Christ in all areas of human life, both private and social. ==Early years== The institute was canonically erected on 1 September 1990 by Gilles Wach and Philippe Mora in Gabon, Africa, where the institute still has missions, notably in the capital Libreville. Its canonical status was of diocesan right until 7 October 2008. On that date it was granted the status of pontifical right by decree, titled \"Saeculorum Rex\", of the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei, on the occasion of the visit of Camille Perl, vice-president of the commission. Deacons and priests are incardinated into the institute, whose prior general has the right to call to orders. The institute is currently based in Gricigliano, Italy, in the Archdiocese of Florence. The international seminary of St. Philip Neri is also located there. Wach currently serves as prior general and Mora as rector of the seminary. Both received their priestly formation under Cardinal Giuseppe Siri of Genoa. As of 2018 the institute numbered 114 priests. The Institute also includes clerical oblates, who go through formation but are not ordained as priests, and who help in the several apostolates of the Institute. The charism of the institute is based on the example of its three patron saints: *Saint Francis de Sales, who emphasized teaching the Catholic faith with patience and charity, and encouraging all Catholics to seek a life of holiness through the ordinary means of the church, such as devout attendance at Mass and frequent confession. *Saint Benedict, with his love for the solemn celebration of the liturgy, his emphasis on work and prayer, his \"Benedictine hospitality\", and his role in laying the groundwork for an integral Christian civilization in medieval Europe. *Saint Thomas Aquinas, with his emphasis on the harmony between faith and reason. The institute also honors as its primary patroness the Virgin Mary under the title of the Immaculate Conception. St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the Child Jesus is the patroness of its African missions. ==Apostolates== In the United States, the institute is located in Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, New Jersey, Connecticut, California, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio with its national headquarters in Chicago. In Chicago, the institute is restoring the historic St. Clara/St. Gelasius Church on Carmelite Way. Upon completion it will become the Shrine of Christ the King. Its oldest United States apostolate is St. Mary Oratory in Rockford, Illinois, and its newest is Most Precious Blood of Jesus parish in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In Kansas City, Missouri, in 2005, Bishop Robert Finn established an oratory (a public church where the Mass and other rites may be administered) for the institute at a historic church otherwise in danger of being closed. The superior for the United States is Canon Matthew Talarico.
