    "text": "' is a rare-type asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, classified as Mars-crosser and exceptionally slow rotator, approximately 4 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 16 March 1999, by Croatian astronomers Korado Korlevi\u0107 and Mario Juri\u0107 at Vi\u0161njan Observatory in Croatia. == Orbit and classification == orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.7\u20133.0 AU once every 3 years and 7 months (1,309 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.29 and an inclination of 12\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. A first precovery was taken at Steward Observatory in 1992, extending the body's observation arc by 7 years prior to its official discovery observation. == Physical characteristics == SDSS photometry characterized as a rare and reddish L-type, which belong to the larger complex of stony asteroids. === Slow rotator and tumbler === In September 2014, American astronomer Robert Stephens obtained a rotational lightcurve from photometric observations taken at the Center for Solar System Studies (CS3, ) in California. It gave an exceptionally long rotation period of hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.55 magnitude (), which makes it one of the slowest rotators known to exist. It is also a suspected tumbling asteroid, which show a non-principal axis rotation. === Diameter and albedo === According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, measures 3.395 and 4.17 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.287 and 0.176, respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 3.92 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 14.4. == Numbering and naming == This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 28 March 2002. As of 2018, it has not been named. == Notes == == References == == External links == * Asteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB), query form (info) * Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Google books * Asteroids and comets rotation curves, CdR \u2013 Observatoire de Gen\u00e8ve, Raoul Behrend * Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (35001)-(40000) \u2013 Minor Planet Center * * 038063 Category:Discoveries by Korado Korlevi\u0107 Category:Discoveries by Mario Juri\u0107 038063 19990316 ",
