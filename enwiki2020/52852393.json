In 2016, NUSACC received the 2016 President of the United States\u2019 \u201cE\u201d Award for Export Service, While various chambers of commerce have won the \u201cE\u201d Award over the years, this is the first time in the 55-year history of the award that it went to a chamber that is dedicated to U.S. \u2013 Arab relations. This award, conferred by the President of the United States, is the highest recognition that any U.S. entity may receive for supporting export activity. NUSACC is a non-partisan, non-profit organization that is registered under U.S. law as a 501-c-6 chamber of commerce. The Chamber is an independent, membership-driven entity that is funded by its member companies and stakeholders. NUSACC\u2019s stakeholders include more than 40,000 companies, the vast majority of which are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) based in the United States. NUSACC is the only business entity in the United States that is officially recognized and authorized by the League of Arab States and the General Union of Arab Chambers of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture. As such, NUSACC is a \u201csister chamber\u201d and partner to the national chambers of commerce throughout the Arab world. On a daily basis, NUSACC works closely with government and private sector leaders throughout the Arab world, as well as high-level decision-makers in the U.S. business community, public policy research centers (\u201cthink tanks\u201d), multilateral institutions, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), media, and the U.S. Government. ==References== Category:Chambers of commerce ",
