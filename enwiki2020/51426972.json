Cohen went on to describe his displease with Giraud de Ohoven at the reunion and his fantasy of firing her saying, \"my mind turned the corner into morphing this into some kind of alternate universe version of the Housewives: \u201cJoyce, you are no longer a Housewife. Please leave the reunion.\" Despite her departure from the series, Giraud de Ohoven has remained friends with former cast member Vanderpump and guest starred on Vanderpump Rules.
