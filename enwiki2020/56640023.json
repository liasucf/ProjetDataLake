    "text": "Shide (Jittoku) from Freer Museum Kan\u014d Sadanobu (, 22 May 1597 \u2013 12 November 1623) was a Japanese painter of the Kan\u014d school. He was the son of the Kan\u014d Mitsunobu, who lost a great deal of the main Kan\u014d school's patronage and prestige. Sadanobu was Mitsunobu's only son and seventh head of the Kan\u014d house descending directly from founded Kan\u014d Masanobu. It was the intention of Mitsunobu's brother, Kan\u014d Takanobu, to have his son, Kan\u014d Tan'y\u016b, remain in Kyoto as designated heir to his father's sub-branch of the Kano school workshop. However, Tan'y\u016b accepted the title of goy\u014d eshi in 1617 and began to plan his atelier in Edo, most likely with the Tokugawa sh\u014dgun's approval. This moved Tan'y\u016b's younger brother, Kan\u014d Naonobu, up as to succeed the family workshop in Kyoto upon Takanobu's death. However, in 1630 the city of Edo was flourishing and Naonobu was also made goy\u014d eshi and given his own parcel of land at Takegawach\u014d in Edo, where he then built his residence and studio. The main Kan\u014d-school workshop, led by Sandanobu by this time, remained in Kyoto, either by instruction of the sh\u014dgun or Sandanbou's own will. However, he had no brothers or children he could designate as heir by the time of his passing in 1623. As a result of Sadanobu leaving no heir, the Kyoto workshop fell into the hands of another Kan\u014d Takanobu child, Kan\u014d Yasunobu. Although Yasunobu was adopted into the main Kyoto house upon Sadanobu's death, sometime during 1624\u20131643 he too was appointed goy\u014d eshi by Tokugawa and moved to Edo to build his workshop known as Nakabashi. However, Yasunobu did not give up his claim to headship of the main house in order to make his move and still considered his branch the main Kan\u014d house.
