The party had candidates shared with the Islamic Iran Participation Front, and was described as its Arabic wing. It won several seats in Ahvaz's City Council, as well as a seat in the Iranian Parliament. == Dissolution == On 4 November 2006, the Judicial system of Iran banned the party and declared it illegal on charges of \"instigating unrest\" and \"opposing the system\", accusing it of fueling 2005 Ahvaz unrest. Following detention of some party members, a faction were radicalized and joined the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahwaz which is a separatist militant organization designated as a \"terrorist organization\" by Iran. == Election results == {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center; font-size:100%; line-height:16px;\" |- !Year !Seats !+/\u2013 !Ref |- !colspan=\"4\"|Local elections Ahvaz City Council |- ||1999 |||||| |- ||2003 |||| 5|| |- !colspan=\"4\"|Parliamentary elections Ahvaz, Bavi, Hamidieh and Karoun |- ||2000 |||||| |- ||2004 |||| 1|| |} == See also == * Politics of Khuzestan Province * Arab separatism in Khuzestan == References == Category:Political parties of minorities Category:Arab nationalism in Iran Category:Arab political parties in Iran Category:Banned political parties in Iran Category:Reformist political groups in Iran Category:Ahwazi Arabs Category:1999 establishments in Iran Category:2006 disestablishments in Iran Category:Political parties established in 1999 Category:Political parties disestablished in 2006 Category:Arab nationalist political parties Category:Defunct political parties of the Islamic Republic of Iran ",
