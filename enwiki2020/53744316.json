One of these is that it the filmmakers have actually gone on location and shot in Poland. The shooting around the various castles and markets adds something picturesque and undeniably different to the standard American locations. Misiorowski at least gives a passably credibility to the situation. The plot is not great but the culture clash aspect is effectively conveyed\" ==References== ==External links== * * * Blood of the Innocent at Moviefone * Blood of the Innocent at Moria.co Category:1995 films Category:American films Category:Polish films Category:English-language films ",
