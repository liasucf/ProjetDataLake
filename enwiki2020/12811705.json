    "text": "Shukhov cracking process, Baku, USSR, 1934 The Shukhov cracking process is a thermal cracking process invented by Vladimir Shukhov and Sergei Gavrilov. Shukhov designed and built the first thermal cracking techniques important to the petrochemical industry. His patent (Shukhov cracking process \u2013 patent of Russian empire No. 12926 from November 27, 1891) on cracking was used to invalidate Standard Oil's patents (Burton process \u2013 Patent of United States No. 1,049,667 on January 7, 1913) on oil refineries. In 1937 the Shukhov cracking process was superseded by catalytic cracking. It is still in use today to produce diesel. ==See also== * Cracking (chemistry) * Timeline of historic inventions * Burton process ==References== * Information on cracking in oil refining * Biography of Vladimir Shukhov * \"Vladimir G.
