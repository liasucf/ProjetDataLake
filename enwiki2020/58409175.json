    "text": "The Canon EOS R is a 30.3 megapixelProduct data sheet full-frame mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera launched by Canon in October 2018. The \"R\" in EOS R comes from the first letter of \"Reimagine optical excellence\", Canon's development concept for both the EOS R system as a whole, and also for this EOS R camera which launched the new system. ==Lenses== The Canon EOS R camera uses the Canon RF lens mount. The following lens models were available at the release date: *Canon RF 35 mm F1.8 Macro IS STM *Canon RF 50 mm F1.2 L USM *Canon RF 24\u2013105 mm F4 L IS USM *Canon RF 28\u201370 mm F2 L USM It is also possible to use older EF and EF-S lenses with one of the three available EF- EOS R mount adapters. Mount Adapter EF-EOS R is the simplest adapter, connecting to EF and EF-S lenses to the EOS R body, the Control Ring Mount Adapter EF-EOS R adds a control ring like those found on RF lenses, providing customizable control (such as ISO, aperture, etc.) with existing EF and EF-S lenses and the Drop-In Filter Mount Adapter EF-EOS R includes drop-in filter capability for use with circular polarizing filters or variable ND filters. A unique feature of the camera compared to other current mirrorless models is that the shutter closes if the camera body is powered off without a lens. This helps protect the 30.3 Megapixel CMOS sensor from dust and debris. ==Gallery== File:Canon EOS R 07 sep 2018b.jpg| File:Canon EOS R 07 sep 2018c.jpg| File:Canon EOS R 07 sep 2018d.jpg| File:Canon EOS R 07 sep 2018e.jpg| File:Canon EOS R 07 sep 2018f.jpg| File:Canon RF24-105mm F4 L IS USM 07 sep 2018.jpg| File:Canon RF28-70mm F2 L USM 07 sep 2018.jpg| ==See also== *Canon EOS RP *Canon EOS M ==References== ==External links== * * * Canon EOS R Category:Canon RF-mount cameras Category:Cameras introduced in 2018 Category:Full-frame mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras ",
