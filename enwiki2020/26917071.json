He qualified again in 2012, but lost to Mardy Fish in the first round. In April 2012, he won his first Challenger title, defeating Frank Dancevic in the Tallahassee final, Dancevic retiring after losing the first set 5\u20137. For the 2013 Australian Open, Smyczek earned entry as the last entry in the field and lucky loser, the highest-ranked player (ATP ranking of no. 128) who lost in the finals of qualifying. After beating Ivo Karlovi\u0107 in the first round, he lost to world no. 4 David Ferrer in the second round in four sets. Tim lost the first round of the 2013 French Open qualifying. He fared better at Wimbledon; he made it to the third round of qualifying for the first time, losing to Matt Reid in four sets. Tim reached the doubles final of the 2013 Hall of Fame Tennis Championships with Rhyne Williams as his partner. In the final the American duo fell to Nicolas Mahut and his partner and fellow Frenchmen Edouard Roger-Vasselin. Tim made it to the third round of the Citi Open. He qualified for the Rogers Cup and made it to the second round. At the 2015 Australian Open, Smyczek entered the main draw as a qualifier, and lost in a four-hour match that ended 7\u20135 in the fifth set against World No. 3 Rafael Nadal in the second round. In the final game of the match, he graciously allowed Nadal to repeat a crucial first serve when Nadal\u2019s serve landed out, possibly due to a disturbance by a member of the crowd. Smyczek (not the chair umpire) initiated the decision for Nadal to repeat the first serve. Smyczek\u2019s sportsmanship resulted in praise from Nadal and the crowd after the match. He would go on to achieve his career high rank of 68 in April. In 2016 Smyczek made the quarterfinals in Houston and Delray Beach.https://www.atptour.com/en/players/tim-smyczek/sf62/player- activity?year=2016 In 2018 Smyczek attained his best main tour result by reaching the semi-finals of Newport.https://www.atptour.com/en/players/tim- smyczek/sf62/player-activity?year=2018 In 2019 Smyczek announced his plans to retire after the U.S. Open but was not granted a wild card.
