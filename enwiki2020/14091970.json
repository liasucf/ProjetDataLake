    "text": "Vitamin K-dependent carboxylation/gamma-carboxyglutamic (GLA) domain is a protein domain that contains post-translational modifications of many glutamate residues by vitamin K-dependent carboxylation to form \u03b3-carboxyglutamate (Gla). Proteins with this domain are known informally as Gla proteins. The Gla residues are responsible for the high-affinity binding of calcium ions. The GLA domain binds calcium ions by chelating them between two carboxylic acid residues. These residues are part of a region that starts at the N-terminal extremity of the mature form of Gla proteins, and that ends with a conserved aromatic residue. This results in a conserved Gla-x(3)-Gla-x- Cys motif that is found in the middle of the domain, and which seems to be important for substrate recognition by the carboxylase. The 3D structures of several Gla domains have been solved. Calcium ions induce conformational changes in the Gla domain and are necessary for the Gla domain to fold properly. A common structural feature of functional Gla domains is the clustering of N-terminal hydrophobic residues into a hydrophobic patch that mediates interaction with the cell surface membrane. At present, the following human Gla-containing proteins (Gla proteins) have been characterized to the level of primary structure: the blood coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X, the anticoagulant proteins C and S, and the factor X-targeting protein Z. The bone Gla protein osteocalcin, the calcification-inhibiting matrix Gla protein (MGP), the cell growth regulating \"growth arrest specific gene 6\" protein GAS6, periostin (a factor necessary for migration and adhesion of epithelial cells), plus two proline-rich Gla-proteins (PRGPs) and two transmembrane Gla proteins (TMGPs), the functions of which are unknown. In all cases in which their function was known, the presence of the Gla residues in these proteins turned out to be essential for functional activity. ==Subfamilies== *Coagulation factor, Gla region ==Human proteins containing this domain == #Thrombin (F2) (a.k.a. coagulation factor II; also its precursor prothrombin) \u2013 involved in coagulation #Factor VII (F7) \u2013 involved in coagulation #Factor IX (F9) \u2013 involved in coagulation #Factor X (F10) \u2013 involved in coagulation #Protein C (PROC) \u2013 roles in regulating anticoagulation, inflammation, cell death, and maintaining the permeability of blood vessel walls #Protein S (PROS1) \u2013 involved in coagulation #Protein Z (PROZ) \u2013 involved in coagulation #Osteocalcin (BGLAP) \u2013 involved in bone mineralization. #Matrix gla protein (MGP) \u2013 inhibitor of calcification of soft tissue and plays a role in bone organization #GAS6 \u2013 thought to be involved in the stimulation of cell proliferation #Transthyretin (TTR) previously known as prealbumin \u2013 carries thyroxine (T4) in blood and into cerebral spinal fluid #Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H2 (ITIH2) \u2013 plays a role in pancreas islets and many other cells #Periostin \u2013 a factor necessary for cell migration (embryonic development, and immune responses) and adhesion of epithelial cells, over-expressed in some cancers #Proline rich gla protein 1 (PRGP1) #Proline rich gla protein 2 (PRGP2) #Transmembrane \u03b3-carboxy glutamyl protein 3 (TMG3) #Transmembrane \u03b3-carboxy glutamyl protein 4 (TMG4) ==References== Category:Protein domains Category:Peripheral membrane proteins ",
