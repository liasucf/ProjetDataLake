In the mid fourteenth century John wrote the Cronica Sive Antiquitates Glastoniensis Ecclesie (Chronicles or Antiquities of the Glastonbury Church) which is a chronicle of Glastonbury Abbey, from when it was founded, up to the period of John's life. The Cronica survives as a full text over seven manuscripts. The Cronica refers to the Arthurian legends several times, and John drew extensively on De Antiquitate Glastonie Ecclesie by William of Malmesbury. == References == == Bibliography == * * * * Category:Benedictine scholars ",
