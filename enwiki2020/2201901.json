    "text": "Ember to Inferno is the debut studio album by American heavy metal band Trivium. It was released on October 14, 2003 through Lifeforce Records and was produced by Jason Suecof and the band themselves. ==Background== This album is the final release by the band with former bassist Brent Young. Frontman Matt Heafy was 17 years old when the album was written and recorded. Corey Beaulieu toured in support of the album, but did not play on the album according to the re-release booklet. The 2004 reissue of the album includes early versions of \"The Deceived\" and \"Blinding Tears Will Break the Skies\". Both songs were re- recorded for Ascendancy, with the latter appearing only on the 2006 special edition. \"Demon\" is taken from the Trivium EP. \"Inception: the Bleeding Skies\" is \"A View of Burning Empires\" played in reverse. On December 2, 2014 it was announced by Matt Heafy on Twitter that Ember to Inferno would be re-released again with new artwork along with the band's early demo EPs. The re-release was officially revealed on October 14, 2016, via Trivium's Facebook page. It was released on December 2, 2016, two years after the initial announcement by Heafy. The re-release is dubbed Ab Initio, Latin for \"From the Beginning\". \"Pillars of Serpents\" was re-recorded by Trivium for their 2017 album The Sin and the Sentence. Titled \"Pillars of Serpents '17\", it was included as a bonus track exclusively on the Japanese edition of the album. The re-recording was widely released to services such as YouTube, Spotify and iTunes on March 22, 2019 under the title of \"Pillars of Serpents (2019)\". ==Track listing== Notes * Tracks 1 to 3 are from Ruber (The Red Demo). * Tracks 4 to 10 are from Caeruleus (The Blue Demo). * Tracks 11 to 13 are from Flavus (The Yellow Demo). ==Personnel== Trivium * Matt Heafy \u2013 lead vocals, guitars * Brent Young \u2013 bass, backing vocals * Travis Smith \u2013 drums, percussion * Corey Beaulieu \u2013 lead guitar on Flavus (The Yellow Demo) Additional musicians * Jason Suecof \u2013 keyboards on \"Inception: the Bleeding Skies\" and \"A View of Burning Empires\", lead guitar on \"Ember to Inferno\" and \"To Burn the Eye\", choir vocals on \"When All Light Dies\" * Alex Vieira \u2013 lead guitar on \"When All Light Dies\" * George Moore \u2013 acoustic guitar on \"A View of Burning Empires\" * Icky \u2013 acoustic guitar Production * Jason Suecof \u2013 producer, mixing, engineer * Matt Heafy \u2013 producer * Travis Smith \u2013 producer * Brent Young \u2013 producer * Tom Morris \u2013 mastering * Christophe Szpajdel \u2013 logo (2016 re-issue) ==Charts== Ab Initio {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) | 85 |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Rock Album Chart | 15 |} ==References== Category:2003 debut albums Category:Trivium (band) albums Category:Lifeforce Records albums Category:Albums produced by Jason Suecof ",
