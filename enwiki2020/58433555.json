    "text": "Midnight McCartney is a tribute album by John Pizzarelli to Paul McCartney, including tracks from Wings. It was released in 2015 with Concord. According to the album's press release, Paul McCartney suggested John Pizzarelli perform tracks from his canon, and offered the title. Pizzarelli had previously performed Beatles songs in his 1996 album Meets the Beatles. John's wife Jessica Molaskey, daughter Madeleine Pizzarelli, father Bucky Pizzarelli, and brother Martin Pizzarelli all performed on the album. ==Reception== Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the source material, but commented the \"key to the record's success is Pizzarelli himself, who delivers upon the laid-back promise of the title but is savvier than he needed to be, which is why Midnight McCartney satisfies.\" Christopher Loudon wrote for the JazzTimes that \"the set\u2019s not all midnight lace. Indeed, lovely as everything wrapped in Pizzarelli\u2019s trademark silken lilt is, the more adventurous selections are more interesting.\" The Times music critic Chris Pearson described the album as \"delightful.\" In an interview with Pizzarelli, James Wood from Guitar World commented the tracks were \"all tastefully done in Pizzarelli\u2019s trademark style.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ===Musicians=== * John Pizzarelliguitar, primary artist * Katherine Finkflute (alto) * Pamela Sklarflute (Alto) * Tony Kadlecktrumpet * John Moscatrombone * Andy Fuscosax (alto) * Harry Allensaxophone (tenor), soloist * Chris Cardonaviola * Mairi Dorman Phaneufcello * Bucky Pizzarelliguitar (rhythm), soloist * Paul Woodielviolin * Robin Zehviolin * H\u00e9lio Alvespiano * Larry Goldingsorgan, piano * Konrad Paszkudzkipiano, bass * Martin Pizzarellibass * Duduka Dafonsecadrums, percussion * Kevin Kannerdrums * Don Sebeskyorchestration * Michael McDonaldprimary artist, vocals * Jessica Molaskeyvocals (background) * Madeleine Pizzarellivocals (background) * Linda McCartneycomposer * Paul McCartneycomposer ===Support=== * John Pizzarelliarranger * Chris Byarscopyist * Holger Ecksteinphotography * Larry Goldingsarranger * Rachel Gutekdesign * Jessica Molaskeyproducer * Bill Mossengineer, mastering, mixing ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:2015 albums Category:John Pizzarelli albums Category:The Beatles tribute albums Category:Concord Records albums ",
