    "text": "Juan Pantoja de la Cruz, 200px Pearls are a valuable gemstone and come in a number of sizes. This is a list of the biggest pearls. ==Context== A pearl is a hard, glistening object produced within the soft tissue (specifically the mantle) of a living shelled mollusk or another animal, such as a conulariid. Just like the shell of a mollusk, a pearl is composed of calcium carbonate (mainly aragonite or a mixture of aragonite and calcite) in minute crystalline form, which has been deposited in concentric layers. The ideal pearl is perfectly round and smooth, but many other shapes, known as baroque pearl can occur. The finest quality of natural pearls have been highly valued as gemstones and objects of beauty for many centuries. Because of this, pearl has become a metaphor for something rare, fine, admirable and valuable. The most valuable pearls occur spontaneously in the wild, but are extremely rare. These wild pearls are referred to as natural pearls. Cultured or farmed pearls from pearl oysters and freshwater mussels make up the majority of those currently sold. Whether wild or cultured, gem-quality pearls are almost always nacreous and iridescent, like the interior of the shell that produces them. However, almost all species of shelled mollusks are capable of producing pearls (technically \"calcareous concretions\") of lesser shine or less spherical shape. There is a lot of myth and legend surrounding some of these pearls. The Pearl of Lao Tzu for a long time thought to be the largest Pearl had its history fabricated by a conman by the name of Victor Barbish. Other pearls like the Centaur Pearl, most likely the largest gem pearl at , have just recently emerged from private collections. ==List== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Name !Origin !Date !Color !data-sort-type=\"number\"| Carat !data- sort-type=\"number\"| Weight !data-sort-type=\"number\"| Height !data-sort- type=\"number\"| Length !data-sort-type=\"number\"| Width !style=\"width:3%;\" class=\"unsortable\"|Notes !style=\"width:3%;\" class=\"unsortable\"|Refs |- | Centaur Pearl | | 2000 | White | | | | | | | |- | Burma Pearl | | 2000 | White | | | | | | | |- | Abalone pearl | | | White | | | | | | | |- | Pearl of Asia | | 1628 | White | | | | | | | |- |Arco Valley Pearl | | | White | | | | | | | |- | Hope Pearl | | | White | | | | | | | |- | La Peregrina pearl | | 1513 | White | | | | | | | |- | Giga Pearl | | | White | | | | | | | |- | Pearl of Lao Tzu | | 1934 | White | | | | | | | |- | Pearl of Puerto | | 1996 | White | | | | | | | |- | Sleeping Lion | | 1765 | White | | | | | | | |} ==See also== *List of gold nuggets by size *Servilia's pearl ==Notes== ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * * * * * \\- Total pages: 160 * * * * * \\- Total pages: 198 * * Category:Pearls Category:Gemstone-related lists ",
