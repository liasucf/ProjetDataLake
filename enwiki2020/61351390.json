He is well known for his work on the behavioral, neurophysiological and pharmacological studies of the primate visual and oculomotor systems.See as sources for information on life and work: PNAS Profile of Peter H. Schiller and the autobiography of Schiller in Larry R. Squire, ed.: The History of Neuroscience in Autobiography, Vol. 7, pp. 586-640. ==Life and career== Schiller was born in 1931 in Berlin, Germany (his father was the Gestalt psychologist Paul von Schiller). His family moved to Budapest in 1934, then to the United States in 1948, where he lives now as a Naturalized American Citizen. After graduating from Duke University (1955), and after his US military service (in Germany, 1955-1957), he enrolled in a graduate program at Clark University (1959), where he earned his PhD with a thesis on visual masking and metacontrastP.H.

Schiller, Behavioral and electrophysiological studies of visual masking. (1969) In: Symposium on Information Processing in the Nervous System, K.N. Leibovic, ed., Springer-Verlag, pp. 141-165., before accepting an invitation by Hans-Lukas Teuber to work at MIT\u2019s Department of Psychology (1962). He has lived in Newton, MA ever since. For more than 40 years, Schiller has been a member of the MIT faculty. He has trained more than 20 doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows, among them Larry Squire, Michael Stryker, Max Cynader, John Maunsell, Nikos Logothetis . . ==Honors== * Member of the National Academy of Sciences * Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences * Honorary member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences * Pepose Vision Science Award ==Professional services== * NIH Experimental Psychology Study Section, 1973-1977 * NIH Visual Sciences B Study Section, 1982-1986 * Editorial Board, Journal of Neurophysiology, 1983-1989 * Editorial Board, Vision Research, 1987-1990 * Editorial Board, Visual Neuroscience, 1992-1997 * Organizer of numerous symposia including those for IBRO, Society for Neuroscience (SFN), ARVO, WBC, Vision Sciences Society (VSS) ==Grants== Continuous funding from * National Institutes of Health * National Science Foundation * Office of Naval Research ==Research== ===Studies in eye movement control=== By recording from the oculomotor neurons in the superior colliculi and frontal eye fields of the alert rhesus monkey as well as performing lesion and electrical stimulation experiments on these areas, Schiller has identified and characterized two parallel neural pathways involved in the generation of visually-guided saccadic eye movements.E. Bizzi and P.H. Schiller, Single unit activity in the frontal eye fields of unanesthetized monkeys during head and eye movement. (1970) Experimental Brain Research, 10, 151-158. P.H. Schiller and F.

Sandell, Interactions between visually and electrically elicited saccades before and after superior colliculus and frontal eye field ablations in the rhesus monkey. (1983) Experimental Brain Research, 49, 381-392. The superior colliculus, which is subcortical, receives visual input from the retina and visual cortex in its upper layers and contains neurons in its lower layers that command saccadic eye movements to the location of visual targets, while the cortical frontal eye fields, which have direct and independent access to the eye-movement controllers in the brain stem, help select targets in the visual scene to which the eyes must be directed. The major result that has emerged from this work is that the superior colliculus is involved in bringing the center of gaze to the new target (foveation) by utilizing a vector code that specifies the error between the present and intended eye positions, a coding scheme that was later shown to be prevalent throughout the neocortex, including the frontal eye fields.P.H. Schiller and E.J. Tehovnik, Look and see: how the brain moves the eyes about. (2001) Progress in Brain Research, 134, 127-142. P.H. Schiller and E.J. Tehovnik, Neural mechanisms underlying target selection with saccadic eye movements. (2005) Progress in Brain Research, 149, 157-171. Using ablation experiments, Schiller further showed that a lesion of the superior colliculus eliminates express saccades, those occurring at latencies of less than 100 ms.P.H. Schiller, J.H. Sandell and J.H.R. Maunsell, The effect of frontal eye field and superior colliculus lesions on saccadic latencies in the rhesus monkey. (1987) Journal of Neurophysiology, 57, 1033-1049. It is believed that the posterior channel, the visual cortex via the superior colliculus, mediates express saccades, while the anterior channel that includes the frontal eye fields is important for target selection. ===Studies in vision and visual perception=== In a series of now classic studies Schiller characterized the functions of two sets of parallel pathways in the visual system: The On- and Off- pathways and the midget and parasol pathways. By administering 2-amino-4-phosphono-butyrate (APB) to the eye, he was able to inactivate the ON-retinal pathway reversibly and demonstrate that the On- and Off-pathways remain segregated from the retina to the striate cortex.P.H. Schiller, Central connections of the retinal ON and OFF pathways. (1982) Nature, 297, 580-583. P.H. Schiller, The connections of the retinal ON and OFF pathways to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the monkey. (1984) Vision Research, 24, 923-932. P.H. Schiller, J.H. Sandell and J.H.R. Maunsell, Functions of the ON and OFF channels of the visual system. (1986) Nature, 322, 824-825. R.P. Dolan and P.H. Schiller, Effects of ON channel blockade with 2-amino-4- phosphonobutyrate (APB) on brightness and contrast perception in monkeys. (1994) Visual Neuroscience, 11, 23-32. P.H. Schiller, The ON and OFF channels of the mammalian visual system. (1995) In: Progress in Retinal and Eye Research, Vol 15, No. 1, N.N. Osborne and G.J. Chader, eds., Pergamon Press. Behavioral studies established that following blockage of the On-pathway, animals no longer responded to light increments. The central idea that has emerged from this work is that there exist specific neural circuitries for perceiving brightness and darkness, an idea first proposed by Ewald Hering in the 19th Century and thereafter by Richard Jung. Schiller further found that the midget channel (or parvocellular system) plays a central role in the wavelength and spatial domains: color vision, high spatial frequency form, shape, texture perception, and fine stereopsis.N.K. Logothetis, P.H. Schiller, E.R. Charles and A.C. Hurlbert, Perceptual deficits and the activity of the color-opponent and broad-band pathways at isoluminance. (1990) Science, 247, 214-217. P.H. Schiller and N.K. Logothetis, The color-opponent and broad-band channels of the primate visual system. (1990) Trends in Neurosciences, 13, 392-398. P.H. Schiller, N.K. Logothetis and E.R. Charles, Functions of the colour-opponent and broad-band channels of the visual system. (1990) Nature, 343, 68-70. P.H. Schiller, N.K. Logothetis and E.R. Charles, Role of the color-opponent and broad-band channels in vision. (1990) Visual Neuroscience, 5, 321-346. In comparison, the parasol channel (or magnocellular system) plays an important role in the temporal domain: low contrast, high velocity motion, motion parallax, and flicker perception. The lesion studies of Schiller established that this functional segregation tends to be diminished once signals reach the neocortex, although the middle temporal area of neocortex is still dedicated to motion processing.P.H. Schiller and K. Lee, The role of the primate extrastriate area V4 in vision. (1991) Science, 251, 1251-1253. P.H.

Schiller, Effect of lesions in visual cortical area V4 on the recognition of transformed objects. (1995) Nature, 376, 342-344. ===Feature detectors vs multi-function analyzers=== In a position paper \u201cOn the specificity of neurons and visual areas\u201d Schiller (1996) proposed that individual neurons in the primate visual cortex in addition to being feature detectors for color, form, motion, depth, texture, and shape perception are multifunctional, performing complex visual tasks such as view- independent object recognition, visual learning, spatial generalization, visual attention, and stimulus selection.P.H. Schiller, On the specificity of neurons and visual areas. (1996) Behavioural Brain Research, 76, 21-35. P.H. Schiller, Past and present ideas about how the visual scene is analyzed by the brain. (1997) In: Cerebral Cortex, Vol 12: Extrastriate Cortex, K.S. Rockland, J.H. Kaas and A. Peters, eds., Plenum. With Karl Zipser and Victor Lamme, he found that stimulus context that falls far outside of the classical receptive field can modulate the response to the center.K. Zipser, V.A.F. Lamme and P.H. Schiller, Contextual modulation in primary visual cortex. (1996) Journal of Neuroscience, 16, 7376-7389. These findings have been verified in other mammals in addition to primates.U.H. Schnabel, L. Kirchberger, E.H. van Beest, S. Mukherjee, A. Barsegyan, J.A.M. Lorteije, C. van der Togt, M.W. Self and P.R. Roelfsema, Feedforward and feedback processing during figure-ground perception in mice. (2018) bioRxiv doi:10.1101/456459. ===A cortical prosthesis to help blind people \"see\"=== The work of Schiller has spawned renewed interest in the development of visuo-cortical prostheses for the blind. While doing electrical-stimulation experiments with Edward Tehovnik in 2001, Schiller observed that if he delivered electrical pulses to the visual cortex while an animal was planning an eye movement into the visual receptive field of the cells under study he could bias saccade execution and even evoke saccadic eye movements into the visual receptive field using currents of less than 50 \u03bcA.P.H. Schiller and E.J. Tehovnik, Look and see: how the brain moves the eyes about. (2001) Progress in Brain Research, 134, 127-142. Using such low currents in combination with visual psychophysics, he was able to estimate the size, contrast, and color of phosphenes evoked from the visual cortex of monkeys.P.H. Schiller and E.J. Tehovnik, Visual prosthesis. (2008) Perception, 37, 1529-1559. P.H. Schiller, W.M. Slocum, M.C. Kwak, G.L. Kendall and E.J.

(2011) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 108, 17809-17814. This line of work is now being used to assess visual prosthetic devices, which could eventually lead to a functional visual prosthesis for blind people.W.H. Bosking, M.S. Beauchamp and D. Yoshor, Electrical stimulation of visual cortex: relevance for development of visual cortical prosthetics. (2017) Annual Review of Visual Science 3, 141-166.
