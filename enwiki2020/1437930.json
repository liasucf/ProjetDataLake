    "text": "William Griffith McBride CBE AO (25 May 1927 \u2013 27 June 2018) was an Australian obstetrician. He discovered the teratogenicity of thalidomide,Papers of William McBride, ca. 1953-1996, National Library of Australia, accessed 26 July 20101960s Timeline \u2013 Australian Broadcasting CorporationPage 48 of The New Scientist, Page 48, Vol. 56 \u2013 published 5 October 1972Dove, Frederick. Thalidomide apology insulting, campaigners say BBC News 1 September 2012. Accessed 31 March 2017 which resulted in the reduction of the number of drugs prescribed during pregnancy. McBride was found guilty of separate counts of medical malpractice and scientific fraud ==Biography== McBride was born in Sydney, Australia.The most influential Australians \u2013 The Sydney Morning HeraldWilliam Griffith McBride biography \u2013 The University of Melbourne ===Thalidomide case=== McBride published a letter in The Lancet, in December 1961, noting a large number of birth defects in children of patients who were prescribed thalidomide,McCredie, Janet. The thalidomide story. Sydney Publishing (University of Sydney), 17 January 2016 after a midwife called Sister Pat Sparrow first suspected the drug was causing birth defects in the babies of patients under his care at Crown Street Women's Hospital in Sydney.http://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2018-06-29/thalidomide-william- mcbride-flawed-character-norman-swan/9920608 McBride was awarded a medal and prize money by the prestigious L'Institut de la Vie, a French institute, in connection with his discovery, in 1971. Using the prize money, he established Foundation 41, a Sydney-based medical research foundation concerned with the causes of birth defects. Working with P H Huang, he proposed that thalidomide caused malformations by interacting with the DNA of the dividing embryonic cells. This finding stimulated their experimentation, which showed that thalidomide may inhibit cell division in rapidly dividing cells of malignant tumors. This work was published in the journal \"Pharmacology and Toxicology\" in 1999 and has been rated in the top ten of the most important Australian medical discoveries. ===Debendox case=== McBride's involvement in the Debendox case is less illustrious. In 1981, he published a paper indicating that the drug Debendox (marketed in the US as Bendectin) caused birth defects. His co-authors noted that the published paper contained manipulated data and protestedThe Insider, Australian Story, 22 February 2001. Retrieved 26 July 2010 but their voices went unheard. Multiple lawsuits were filed by patients, and McBride was a willing witness for the claimants. Eventually, the case was investigated and, as a result, McBride was struck off the Australian medical register in 1993 for deliberately falsifying data.Thalidomide hero found guilty of scientific fraud \u2013 The New Scientist, 27 February 1991 An inquiry determined \"we are forced to conclude that McBride did publish statements which he either knew were untrue or which he did not genuinely believe to be true, and in that respect was guilty of scientific fraud.\" He was reinstated to the medical register in 1998.\"Time Magazine\" Medical Tribunal of New South Wales Dr. McBride hails end of the affair \u2013 \"The Australian\" The Bendectin case, and the subsequent removal of the drug from the US market, has had a number of consequences.Brent R. \"Medical, social, and legal implications of treating nausea and vomiting of pregnancy\" Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002 May;186(5 Suppl Understanding):S262-6 Firstly, there was an immediate increase in the rates of hospitalization for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. Secondly, it created a treatment void in terms of having a safe medication that could be used for alleviating morning sickness in US pregnant women, a condition which, in the most severe form, called hyperemesis gravidarum, could be both life- threatening and cause women to terminate their pregnancy. The removal from the market of a safe and effective drug for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy resulted in the use of other, less studied drugs in pregnancy.Mitchell AA, Gilboa SM, Werler MM, Kelley KE, Louik C, Hern\u00e1ndez- D\u00edaz S; National Birth Defects Prevention Study. Medication use during pregnancy, with particular focus on prescription drugs: 1976\u20132008\" Am J Obstet Gynecol 2011 Jul;205(1):51.e1-8 Thirdly, it has been claimed that subsequent to the Bendectin experience, drug companies stayed away from developing medications for pregnant patients. As a result, only a few medications were approved by the FDA for obstetrical indications in the past several decades.Centerwatch. FDA Approved Drugs for Obstetrics/Gynecology (Women's Health); as seen in: https://www.centerwatch.com/drug-information/fda- approved-drugs/therapeutic-area/11/obstetrics-gynecology-womens-health Lastly, the perception that all medications are teratogenic increased among pregnant women and healthcare professionals. The unfounded fear of using medications during pregnancy has precluded many women from receiving the treatment they require. Leaving medical conditions untreated during pregnancy can result in adverse pregnancy outcomes or significant morbidity for both the mother and baby. Ongoing education of physicians and the general public has resulted in improvements in the perception of medication use in pregnancy; however, further advances are required to overcome the devastating effects of the Bendectin saga. ===Honours=== McBride was nominated Man of the Year for 1962,\"Saviour of babies\u2014The Man of the Year\" \u2013 Article published on page 1 of The Daily Mirror (Sydney), Sydney, Friday, 28 December 1962.
