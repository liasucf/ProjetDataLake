    "text": "Unwound is the first studio album by the American post-hardcore band Unwound, though it wasn\u2019t released until 1995. Trouser Press called the album \"one of their best\". ==Background and Recording== Recorded in May 1992, Unwound wasn't released until August 1995, at which point Unwound had already recorded and released three other albums on Kill Rock Stars. \"Kandy Korn Rituals\" and \"Against\" (the latter of which is unlisted and attached to \"Kandy Korn Rituals\" on this album) were previously released on a 7\" by Kill Rock Stars in 1992, along with a live song called \"Hating in D\". \"You Bite My Tongue\", \"Understand & Forget\" and \"Kids Is Gone\" were released as a self-titled 7\" by Gravity Records in 1993. The other songs on this album were previously unreleased. Drummer Brandt Sandeno quit before the mixing was completed, thus the album was shelved until 1995 when the band decided \"it was good\" and finished the mixing. The vinyl version was released on Vern Rumsey's Punk In My Vitamins label. The album became out-of-print for many years until it was reissued in the vinyl boxset Kid Is Gone in 2013. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Justin Trosper - Vocals, Guitar * Vern Rumsey - Bass * Brandt Sandeno - Drums * Jane Laughlin - Photography * Steve Fisk - Recording, mixing * Stuart Hallerman - Recording ==References== Category:Unwound albums Category:1995 albums Category:Albums produced by Steve Fisk ",
