    "text": "This article covers the use of copulas in the Turkish language. In Turkish, copulas are called ek-eylem () or ek-fiil () ('suffix-verb'). The Turkish copula is one of the more distinct features of Turkish grammar. Turkish is a highly agglutinative language and copulas are rendered as suffixes, albeit with a few exceptions. == Zero copula == Zero copula is the rule for third person, as in Hungarian and Russian. That means two nouns, or a noun and an adjective can be juxtaposed to make a sentence without using any copula. Third-person plural might be indicated with the use of plural suffix -lar/-ler. :{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"6\" cellpadding=\"3\" |- | Hakan yolcu. | Hakan is a traveller. |- | Deniz mavi. | The sea is blue. |- | Kap\u0131lar ve camlar a\u00e7\u0131k. | The doors and windows are open. |- | Asans\u00f6r bozuk. | The elevator is broken. |- | \u0130\u015f\u00e7iler \u00fczg\u00fcn. | The workers are sad. |} == To be (olmak versus imek) == Turkish \"to be\" as regular/auxiliary verb (olmak) and \"to be\" as copula (imek) contrasts. The auxiliary verb imek (i- is the root) shows its existence only through suffixes to predicates that can be nouns, adjectives or arguably conjugated verb stems, arguably being the only irregular verb in Turkish. The missing forms of i- are supplied by ol-: the infinitive olmak is an example, since there is no infinitive *imek. An infinitive ermek appeared in ancient texts; its stem er- became the current i-.G. L. Lewis, Turkish Grammar, Oxford University Press, 1967; 2nd edition, 2000 The word idir, a variation of imek indicates alethic modality, so is used for emphasis, or to prevent ambiguity. \u0130dir is an enclitic word, and exhibits vowel harmony when used as a suffix. Therefore Ali asker idir turns into Ali askerdir. In examples, emphasised word is written bold: :{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"6\" cellpadding=\"3\" | align=left | || align=right | |- | Abbas yolcudur. | Abbas is a traveller. |- | Deniz mavidir. | The sea is blue. |- | Kap\u0131lar ve camlar a\u00e7\u0131kt\u0131r. | The doors and windows are open. |- | Asans\u00f6r bozuktur. | The lift is broken. |- | \u0130\u015f\u00e7iler \u00fczg\u00fcnd\u00fcr. | The workers are sad. |} == Negative copula == Negation is indicated by the negative copula de\u011fil. De\u011fil is never used as a suffix, but it takes suffixes according to context. :{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"6\" cellpadding=\"3\" | align=left | || align=right | |- | Abbas yolcu de\u011fil. | Abbas is not a traveller. |- | Kap\u0131lar ve camlar a\u00e7\u0131k de\u011fildir. | The doors and windows are not open. |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen de\u011filim. | I am not a/the teacher. |- | Mutlu de\u011filmi\u015fiz | (Apparently) we were not happy. |} == Personal copulas == A complete sentence is formed by the addition of a suffix to a noun or adjective as an instance of nonverbal person agreement, with the conjugate verb \"imek\" only implied. These suffixes are, in origin, personal pronouns and indicate grammatical person. :{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"6\" cellpadding=\"3\" |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen-i-m | teacher-- | I am a/the teacher |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen-si-n | teacher-- | You are a/the teacher |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen | teacher | He/she/it is a/the teacher |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen-i-z | teacher-- | We are (the) teachers |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen-si-niz | teacher-- | You [plural/formal] are (a/the) teacher(s) |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen-ler | teacher- | They are (the) teachers |} == Past copulas == Alethic past tense is indicated with idi, another variation of imek. It is enclitic and exhibits vowel harmony like idir. :{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"6\" cellpadding=\"3\" |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen-di-m | teacher-- | I was a/the teacher (as I know) |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen-di-n | teacher-- | You were a/the teacher (as I know) |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen-di | teacher- | He/she/it was a/the teacher (as I know) |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen-di-k | teacher-- | We were (the) teachers (as I know) |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen-di-niz | teacher-- | You [plural/formal] were (a/the) teacher(s) (as I know) |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen-di-ler | teacher-- | They were (the) teachers (as I know) |} The inferential past tense is indicated with imi\u015f. It is enclitic and exhibits vowel harmony like idir. :{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"6\" cellpadding=\"3\" |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen-mi\u015f-i-m | teacher--- | I was a/the teacher (as I've heard) |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen-mi\u015f-si-n | teacher--- | You were a/the teacher (as I've heard) |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen-mi\u015f | teacher- | He/she/it was a/the teacher (as I've heard) |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen-mi\u015f-i-z | teacher--- | We were (the) teachers (as I've heard) |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen-mi\u015f-si-niz | teacher--- | You [plural/formal] were (a/the) teacher(s) (as I've heard) |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen-ler-mi\u015f | teacher-- | They were (the) teachers (as I've heard) |} == Conditional copulas == Conditional (hypothetical) mood is indicated with ise. It is enclitic and exhibits vowel harmony like idir. :{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"6\" cellpadding=\"3\" |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen-se-m | teacher-- | If I am a/the teacher |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen-se-n | teacher-- | If you are a/the teacher |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen-se | teacher- | If he/she/it is a/the teacher |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen-se-k | teacher-- | If we are (the) teachers |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen-se-niz | teacher-- | If you [plural/formal] are (a/the) teacher(s) |- | \u00d6\u011fretmen-ler-se | teacher-- | If they are (the) teachers |} ==References== Copula ",
