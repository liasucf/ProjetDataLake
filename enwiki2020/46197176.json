He and his wife Marie Mayoux were imprisoned during World War I (1914\u201318) for publishing a pacifist pamphlet. He wrote many articles for anarchist journals. ==Early years== Fran\u00e7ois Mayoux was born on 24 June 1882 in Beaulieu-sur-Sonnette, Charente. He became a teacher, and his partner Marie Mayoux was also a teacher. Marie and Francois taught in Charente, then in Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne. They belonged to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration nationale des Syndicats d'institutrices et instituteurs publics. ==Socialist== During World War I (1914\u201318) the Mayouxes were firm pacifists and hostile to the Union sacr\u00e9e. They both joined the socialist French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO: Section fran\u00e7aise de l'internationale ouvri\u00e8re) in 1915. They were placed on Carnet B. The International Action Committee (CAI: Comit\u00e9 d'action internationale) was founded in December 1915 by French syndicalists who supported the pacifist declarations of the Zimmerwald Conference. In 1916 the CAI merged with the Socialist Minority Committee to form the Committee for the Resumption of International Relations (Comit\u00e9 pour la r\u00e9prise des r\u00e9lations internationales). In February 1917 the Committee for the Resumption of International Relations split up. Alphonse Merrheim withdrew to concentrate on union work. Pierre Brizon, Jean Raffin-Dugens and Bourderon joining the SFIO minority led by Jean Longuet. The socialists Fernand Loriot, Charles Rappoport, Louise Saumoneau and Fran\u00e7ois Mayoux took control of the committee. In 1917 the Mayouxes were condemned to two years in prison and a heavy fine for published a pacifist brochure entitled \"The Teachers Union and the War\". The teacher and pacifist Madeleine Vernet gave a home to their eldest son. Marie was released on 1 April 1919 after ten months. Francois had to wait to be released until the amnesty shortly before the legislative elections of 14 November 1919. Their licenses to teach were revoked, and would not be reinstated until 1924. ==Communist== The Mayouxes left the SFIO in November 1919 and joined the French Communist Party (PCF: Parti communiste fran\u00e7ais) after the Congress of Tours. Francois was secretary of the Union des syndicats des Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne from 1919 to 1921. Marie and Fran\u00e7ois Mayoux were expelled from the PCF at the Party congress held in Paris from 16\u201319 October 1922 as \"unrepentant sydicalists\". Francois said this was due to their defense of the autonomy of unions from the Communist Party, and their sympathy with the Russian opposition. ==Anarchist== From 1923 to 1936 the Mayouxes published a small bulletin Notre point de vue. They became libertarian, and wrote for anarchist journals such as La Revue Anarchiste, La Voix Libertaire, CQFD, D\u00e9fense de l'Homme and Le Monde Libertaire. In 1929 they were expelled from the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du travail unitaire (CGTU), but continued their activism. After being expelled from the CGTU they founded an independent teacher's union. They supported the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War (1936\u201339) and denounced the Stalinist \"gravediggers.\" At the start of World War II (1939\u201345) their son Jehan Mayoux, who shared his parents' pacifist convictions, refused conscription and was imprisoned. After the war Francois wrote his memoirs while in retirement in La Ciotat. Fran\u00e7ois Mayoux died on 21 July 1967 at La Ciotat. ==Publications== * * ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * * Category:1882 births Category:1967 deaths Category:French communists ",
