It topped the Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart in September 2018. It became the band's fourteenth song to top the chart. ==Background== After releasing \"The Mountain\" as the first single from their sixth studio album Outsider, the band chose \"Infra-Red\" as the album's second single. It was first released as a single on June 12, 2018. A lyric video was first released for the song on July 9, 2018, with the song's lyrics being displayed in a dark warehouse with red tinges of color.
