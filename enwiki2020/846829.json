Skunk Anansie formed in 1994, disbanded in 2001 and reformed in 2009. The name \"Skunk Anansie\" is taken from Akan folk tales of Anansi the spider-man of Ghana, with \"Skunk\" added to \"make the name nastier\". They have released six studio albums: Paranoid & Sunburnt (1995), Stoosh (1996), Post Orgasmic Chill (1999),\"SKUNK ANANSIE: GREAT EXPECTATIONS\". Chart Attack, Interview by Sean K. Robb, 1999.

They are often grouped as part of a Britrock movement, running alongside Britpop. The band, in 2004, was named as one of the most successful UK chart acts between 1952 and 2003 by the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums, with a total of 142 weeks on both the singles and album charts ranking them at No. 491. When the book first published this annual top 500 list in 2000, it only involved weeks spent on the singles chart until 2004's 17th edition. ==History== ===Formation and early career: 1994\u20132001=== The group played its first gig at London's Splash club in March 1994.
