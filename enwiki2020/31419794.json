    "text": "Kevin John Freeman (born October 21, 1941) is an American equestrian who competed at three Olympic Games, winning silver medals in team eventing in 1964 and 1972. ==Early life== Born in Portland, Oregon, Freeman grew up on a farm in nearby Molalla. After attending Cornell University, Freeman developed his equestrian skills in California. He competed in the 1963 Pan American Games, earning a gold medal in team competition, and a silver as an individual. ==Olympics== In 1964, Freeman competed in eventing for the United States at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo aboard Gallopade, earning a silver medal in team competition and finishing 12th individually. Freeman competed again on the US Team in the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City riding Chalan. Kevin had ridden Chalan only one time before the Olympics and that was the day before the team shipped out for Mexico. In spite of a torrential rain storm on cross-country which obliterated some of the take-offs and landings, the team still won the silver medal. ==After competition== He was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1991, and in 2009, was inducted into the United States Eventing Association Hall of Fame along with Good Mixture, his horse at the 1972 Olympics. Freeman lives in the Garden Home neighborhood of Portland. ==References== Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Portland, Oregon Category:People from Molalla, Oregon Category:Cornell University alumni Category:American male equestrians Category:Olympic equestrians of the United States Category:Olympic silver medalists for the United States in equestrian Category:Equestrians at the 1964 Summer Olympics Category:Equestrians at the 1968 Summer Olympics Category:Equestrians at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic medalists in equestrian Category:Sportspeople from the Portland metropolitan area Category:Medalists at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1964 Summer Olympics Category:Pan American Games medalists in equestrian Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for the United States Category:Pan American Games silver medalists for the United States Category:Equestrians at the 1963 Pan American Games ",
