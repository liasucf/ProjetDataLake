The landmark is the most easterly point on the island and a popular tourist destination. Indian Head is located at one end of Seventy Five Mile Beach. The headland was named by Captain Cook when he passed it on the evening of 19 May 1770, for the aboriginal people he saw assembled there. The term \"Indian\" was used at that time for the native people of many lands. The outcrop consists of rhyolite that was originally created by volcanic activity about 50 to 80 million years ago. Camping around the headland is not permitted. Climbing Indian Head provides 360\u00b0 views as well as good wildlife spotting opportunities, Such as mantarays, sharks and whales. ==References== Category:Headlands of Queensland Category:Fraser Island ",
