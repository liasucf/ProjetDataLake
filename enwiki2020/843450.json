    "text": "In Mexico there are three major kinds of public holidays: * Statutory holiday: Holidays observed all around Mexico. Employees are entitled to a day off with regular pay and schools (public and private) are closed for the day. * Civic holiday: These holidays are observed nationwide, but employees are not entitled to a day off with pay and schools (public and private) still continue. * Festivities: These are traditional holidays to honor religious events, such as Carnival, Holy Week, Easter, etc. or public celebrations, such as Mother's Day, Father's Day, Valentine's Day, etc. Dia de la Independence or Anniversario de la Independence, September 16, commemorates Mexico's independence from Spain and is the most important patriotic statutory holiday. Parades are held and many schools are closed. ==Statutory holidays== Statutory holidays (referred as \"feriados\" or \"d\u00edas de asueto\" in Mexico) are legislated through the federal government and ruled by the Federal Labor Law (Ley Federal del Trabajo). Most workers, public and private, are entitled to take the day off with regular pay. However, some employers may require employees to work on such a holiday, but the employee must be paid: * the regular pay for the statutory holiday if no work is performed by the employee, and * the regular pay and two additional daily salary rates if work is performed by the employee, for a total of triple the usual rate. When a statutory holiday falls on a Sunday, Monday is considered a statutory holiday; if a statutory holiday falls on Saturday, Friday will be considered a statutory holiday. {| class=wikitable |-Feliz Navidad !Date !English name !Spanish name !Remarks |- |width=\"10%\" align=\"center\"|January 1 |width=\"10%\" align=\"center\"|New Year's Day |width=\"10%\" align=\"center\"|A\u00f1o Nuevo |First day of the year. |- |width=\"10%\" align=\"center\"|February 5 |width=\"10%\" align=\"center\"|Constitution Day |width=\"10%\" align=\"center\"|D\u00eda de la Constituci\u00f3n |Celebrates the promulgations of the 1857 and 1917 Constitutions (ratified on 5 February 1857 and 5 February 1917 respectively) (See also Patriotic holidays in Mexico).

Mexican families decorate homes and parties, during New Year's, with colors such as red, to encourage an overall improvement of lifestyle and love, yellow to encourage blessings of improved employment conditions, green to improve financial circumstances and white to improved health. Mexican sweet bread is baked with a coin or charm hidden in the dough. When the bread is served, the recipient whose slice contains the coin or charm is believed to be blessed with good luck in the new year. Another tradition is making a list of all the bad or unhappy events from the current year; before midnight, this list is thrown into a fire, symbolizing the removal of negative energy from the new year. At the same time, thanks is expressed for all the good things had during the year that is coming to its end so that they will continue to be had in the new year. Mexicans celebrate by having a dinner with their families, the traditional meal being turkey and mole, a tradition which has now spanned worldwide. Those who want to party generally go out afterwards, to local parties or night clubs. If you're in Mexico, you can still enjoy festivities in the street. In Mexico City there is a huge street festival on New Year's Eve; celebrations center around the Zocalo, the city's main square. One can expect a lot of firecrackers, fireworks and sparklers being fired. At midnight there is a lot of noise and everyone shouts: \"Feliz a\u00f1o nuevo!\" People embrace, make noise, set off firecrackers, and sing. |} ==Dates of observance for moveable holidays== *2020 **February 3 \u2013 Constitution Day **March 16 \u2013 Benito Juarez's Birthday (Note: Celebrations after this date were generally low-key due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico.) **April 9 \u2013 Holy Thursday **April 10 \u2013 Good Friday **June 21 \u2013 Father's Day **November 16 \u2013 Revolution Day *2021 **February 1 \u2013 Constitution Day **February 14 \u2013 Carnaval **March 15 \u2013 Benito Juarez's Birthday **April 1 \u2013 Holy Thursday **April 2 \u2013 Good Friday **June 20 \u2013 Father's Day **November 15 \u2013 Revolution Day *2022 **February 7 \u2013 Constitution Day **February 27\u2013 Carnaval **March 15 \u2013 Benito Juarez's Birthday **April 10 \u2013 Holy Week begins **April 14 \u2013 Holy Thursday **April 15 \u2013 Good Friday **June 19 \u2013 Father's Day **November 21 \u2013 Revolution Day *2023 **February 6 \u2013 Constitution Day **February 19\u2013 Carnaval **March 21 \u2013 Benito Juarez's Birthday **April 2 \u2013 Holy Week begins **April 6 \u2013 Holy Thursday **April 7 \u2013 Good Friday **June 19 \u2013 Father's Day **November 20 \u2013 Revolution Day *2024 **February 5 \u2013 Constitution Day **February 11 \u2013 Carnaval **March 18 \u2013 Benito Juarez's Birthday **March 24 \u2013 Holy Week begins **March 28 \u2013 Holy Thursday **March 29 \u2013 Good Friday **June 2 \u2013 2024 General election in Mexico **June 16 \u2013 Father's Day **October 1 \u2013 Presidential Inauguration Day **November 18 \u2013 Revolution Day *2025 **February 3 \u2013 Constitution Day **March 2 \u2013 Carnaval **March 17 \u2013 Benito Juarez's Birthday **April 13 \u2013 Holy Week begins **April 17 \u2013 Holy Thursday **April 18 \u2013 Good Friday **June 15 \u2013 Father's Day **November 17 \u2013 Revolution Day *2026 **February 2 \u2013 Constitution Day **February 15 \u2013 Carnaval **March 16 \u2013 Benito Juarez's Birthday **March 29 \u2013 Holy Week begins **April 2 \u2013 Holy Thursday **April 3 \u2013 Good Friday **June 21 \u2013 Father's Day **November 16 \u2013 Revolution Day *2027 **February 1 \u2013 Constitution Day **February 7 \u2013 Carnaval **March 15 \u2013 Benito Juarez's Birthday **March 21 \u2013 Holy Week begins **March 25 \u2013 Holy Thursday **March 26 \u2013 Good Friday **June 20 \u2013 Father's Day **November 15 \u2013 Revolution Day *2028 **February 7 \u2013 Constitution Day **February 27 \u2013 Carnaval **March 20 \u2013 Benito Juarez's Birthday **April 9 \u2013 Holy Week begins **April 13 \u2013 Holy Thursday **April 14 \u2013 Good Friday **June 18 \u2013 Father's Day **November 20 \u2013 Revolution Day *2029 **February 5 \u2013 Constitution Day **February 11 \u2013 Carnaval **March 19 \u2013 Benito Juarez's Birthday **March 25 \u2013 Holy Week begins **March 29 \u2013 Holy Thursday **March 30 \u2013 Good Friday **June 17 \u2013 Father's Day **November 19 \u2013 Revolution Day ==See also== * Flag flying days in Mexico * Christmas in Mexico * Holy Week in Mexico ==References== ==External links== *Secretar\u00eda del Trabajo y Previsi\u00f3n Social Mexico ",
