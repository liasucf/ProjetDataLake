(Greek: \u0393.\u03a3. \u039b\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 K.A.E.), commonly known as simply Lavrio B.C., and also known for sponsorship reasons as Lavrio Megabolt and Lavrio Aegean Cargo, is a Greek professional basketball club that is based in Lavrio, Greece. The club's full name is Gymnastikos Syllogos Lavrio Basketball Club. The club's current logo is an owl, symbolizing the ancient Greek coin Dekadrachm. The team currently plays in the Greek League, the top-tier level basketball league in Greece. ==History== Lavrio was founded in 1990. The club played in the local regional ESKA leagues from 1990 to 2002. The club then spent five years playing at the Greek C National League level, from 2002 until 2007, when the club was promoted to the Greek B National League. During the club's first two seasons in the Greek National B League, 2007\u201308 and 2008\u201309, Lavrio ranked 6th in the final league standings. But the next season, 2009\u201310, it was declared the champion team of the category, after winning a tie-breaker with Panelefsiniakos (24 wins and 6 losses ). Therefore, for the first time in the club's history, it came up to the A2 National League. At the same time, in the organization of the Greek Cup, the club was eliminated after four games, losing in the 2nd leg of the second phase of the tournament against PAOK, by a score of 73\u201383. During its first season in the Greek A2 Basketball League, in 2010\u201311, Lavrio finished in 4th place in the league standings. In the Greek Cup, the club was eliminated on the 2nd game day, where they were defeated by a score of 69\u201363, against Nea Kifissia. The following season, 2011\u201312, while still competing in the same league category, they finished in 8th place in the league standings. In the course of the Greek Cup, they were eliminated on the 2nd game day of Phase A, after being defeated by a score of 74\u201359, against Panerythraikos. In the 2012\u201313 season, the team continued its good performances, and finished in 5th place in the final standings of the league classification tables. In the Greek Cup, they were eliminated at the first game of the second phase, when they were defeated by Ikaroi Serron, by a score of 64\u201360. In the 2014\u201315 season, Lavrio played in the Greek A2 League, and finished in third place in the league. Because the club KAOD withdrew from the top-tier Greek Basket League, Lavrio was then promoted to the top professional national basketball league in Greece, for the first time in its history. Lavrio managed to secure their place in the league for the next season one game before the end of the season, even though the team lost that game to Aries Trikala. The club finished the 2015\u201316 Greek League season in 11th place in the regular season. The club played in a European-wide competition for the first time in the 2018\u201319 season, as it competed in Europe's fourth-tier level competition, the FIBA Europe Cup. On September 20, 2018, Lavrio played its first European game which resulted in an 82\u201373 victory over BC Dnipro. ==Arena== Lavrio plays its home games at the Lavrio Indoor Hall, which has a seating capacity of 1,700. ==Sponsorship names== Due to sponsorship reasons, the club has known several names: *Lavrio DHI (2016\u20132017) *Lavrio Megabolt\u0395\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf \"\u039b\u03b1\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf MEGABOLT\" (2017\u20132018) *Lavrio Aegean Cargo (2018\u2013present) ==Club honors== ===Domestic competitions=== *Greek 4th Division First Group Champion: (2006\u201307) *Greek 3rd Division Champion: (2009\u201310) ==Season by season== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%; text- align:center\" !Season !Tier !Division ! ! !Greek Cup !colspan=2|European competitions |- |- |bgcolor=#efefef|2013\u201314 | 2 | align=left| A2 Basket League | 10th | 11\u201315 | | colspan=2 | |- |bgcolor=#efefef|2014\u201315 | 3 | align=left| A2 Basket League | style=\"background:#BBF3BB\" |3rd | 18\u20138 | | colspan=2 | |- |bgcolor=#efefef|2015\u201316 | 1 | align=left| Basket League | 11th | 9\u201317 | | colspan=2 | |- |bgcolor=#efefef|2016\u201317 | 1 | align=left| Basket League | 8th | 11\u201317 | | colspan=2 | |- |bgcolor=#efefef|2017\u201318 | 1 | align=left| Basket League | 6th | 14\u201314 | | colspan=2 | |- |bgcolor=#efefef|2018\u201319 | 1 | align=left| Basket League | 12th | 7\u201319 | | align=left|4 FIBA Europe Cup || |- |} ==Logos== GS Lavrio log.png |Primary club logo (2013\u201317) GS Lavrio Megabolt logo.png|Megabolt sponsored logo (2017\u2013present) ==Players== ===Current roster=== ===Depth chart=== ===Notable players=== * border Sakis Giannakopoulos * border Michalis Perrakis * border Giannis Kouzeloglou * border Dimitris Kaklamanakis * border Nikos Barlos * border Christoforos Stefanidis * border Vangelis Sakellariou * border Vassilis Charalampopoulos * border Michalis Lountzis * 20px Milan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 * 20px Gilvydas Biruta * 20px Jito Kok * 20px Malik Dime * 20px Marko Ke\u0161elj * 20px Ashley Hamilton * 20px Kyle Allman Jr. * 20px Demarius Bolds * 20px Devin Davis * 20px Quenton DeCosey * border Sean Evans * 20px D.
