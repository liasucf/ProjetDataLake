In 1914, she started working at the Central School of Art and Design, nowadays Central Saint Martins, where she taught Dress Design. Alongside her teaching job, she produced costumes for various theatres in London. Later on, in 1930, she became Head of the School of Costume at the Central School. Cochrane kept this position until 1957, when she suffered from a sudden death. == Teachings == Since her student years, Cochrane developed an interest for historical costume accuracy, which she studied in detail, something that she passed on to her students. She also believed that working on actual productions during the course would benefit the students. Such belief led to her persistence to build, attached to the school, a theatre with adjoining workshops, costume cutting rooms and design studios. In her research, she explored the theme of historical accuracy and she did a study on colour and cut, which she transformed into a book named Costume, Colour and Cut: A Sketch of the Evolution of Costume Design with Brief Notes and Patterns to Help Those Interested in Dressing the Play, published in 1955 by the National Federation of Women's Inst.Cochrane, Jeanetta. \u201cCostume Colour and Cut\u201d, Google Books == Legacy == After her death, the London County Council built the Cochrane Theatre, named after her.
