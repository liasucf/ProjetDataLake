    "text": "The Cohors I Asturum et Callaecorum (civium Romanorum) (1st cohort of the Asturians and Callaecans) was a Roman auxilia unit. ==Description== The soldiers of the cohort were recruited from the Asturians and Callaecans in the territory of today's Asturias and Galicia. The soldiers of the Unit had been granted Roman citizenship at a certain time. However, this did not apply to soldiers who were taken into the unit after this time. They received the Roman citizenship only with their honorable discharge (Honesta missio) after 25 years of service.Margaret M. Roxan: The Auxilia of the Roman Army raised in the Iberian Peninsula Volume 1. discovery.ucl.ac.uk, 1973, p396-407 Since there are no inscriptions of milliaria (1000 men) and equitata, so it is to be assumed that it is a pure infantry cohort (Cohors peditata). The target strength of the unit was 480 men, consisting of 6 centuria with 80 men each. ==History== The first proof of unity in the province of Mauretania Tingitana is based on an inscription found in Volubilis, dated AD 57 (ILM 00058).Margaret M.
