It is the main transmission antenna in all of Aarhus and it is the second tallest building in Denmark. The tower is situated on the top of the hill of S\u00f8sterh\u00f8j (112 metres above sea level) in the neighbourhood of Sk\u00e5de, in the district of H\u00f8jbjerg. The construction of Telecommunication Tower Aarhus began in 1956, and it was finished later that same year. The tower and mast reach 216 m tall, with the tower itself at 65 metres. Telecommunication Tower Aarhus has been noted worldwide for its relatively unusual use of concrete as a construction material for the tower supporting the long wired mast. ==References== ==External links== * Scyscraperpage.com S\u00f8sterh\u00f8j Senderen on Scyscraperpage.com * Emporis.com S\u00f8sterh\u00f8j Senderen on Emporis.com Category:Radio masts and towers in Europe Category:Towers completed in 1956 Category:Towers in Denmark Category:Telecommunications in Denmark Category:Buildings and structures in Aarhus ",
