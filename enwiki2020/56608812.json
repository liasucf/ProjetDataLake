    "text": "Francis Barnett Prine (known as Barney Prine) was an American pioneer who was one of the first settlers to homestead in the Ochoco country of central Oregon. When he was young, Prine traveled with his family from Missouri to Oregon's Willamette Valley over the Oregon Trail. He served in the 1st Oregon Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War. Prine later moved to the Central Oregon, where he established several businesses in what became Prineville, Oregon, a town named in his honor. == Early life == Prine was born on 1 January 1841 in Jackson County, Missouri, east of Kansas City. His parents were Francis \"Frank\" Prine and Alice Elizabeth \"Elsie\" (Dealy) Prine. In 1853, Prine's family left Missouri for Oregon. Prine was only 12 years old, but he drove one of the family's wagons and took his turn standing guard at night while crossing the plains and mountains along the Oregon Trail.Lockley, Fred, \"Prineville of Pioneer Days Described by Lockley in Journal\", Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 14 April 1927, p. 5 & 7.\"Story of Prine Recalled by Act in Pioneer Park\", Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 25 August 1954, p. 23. The Prine family settled in Linn County in Oregon's Willamette Valley. The family established a farm approximately from Scio, Oregon, near the place where the north and south forks of the Santiam River merge. Prine attended school near Scio. As a youth, he made spending money winning foot races against other boys. At least one of his races was reported in local newspapers.Lockley, Fred, \"\"Observations and Impressions of the Journal Man\", Oregon Daily Journal, Portland, Oregon, 28 October 1921, p. 10. His record-breaking mile run was still remembered and cited in a newspaper article three decades later.\"Barney Prine Went Home\", Albany Democrat, Albany, Oregon, 18 December 1903, p. 7. In 1862, Prine took up a gold mining claim near Florence on the Oregon Coast. His claim was very productive, but Prine spent everything he made. He admitted to spending as much a $1,000 in a single day, gambling and buying drinks for his friends. During the American Civil War, Prine supported the Union, serving in Company F of the 1st Oregon Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He entered the United States Army in November 1864 and served until his company was disbanded in July 1866. His company was commanded by Captain Ebner W. Waters. During his service, Prine was recognized as an outstanding soldier and was promoted to corporal.\"Soldier Details\u2014Prine , Francis B.\", Civil War Search For Soldiers database, National Park Service, United States Department of Interior, Washington, District of Columbia, accessed 3 November 2017.Lockley, Fred \"Observations and Impressions of the Journal Man\", Oregon Daily Journal, Portland, Oregon, 19 June 1919, p. 12. \"Oregon Infantry\", Official Army Register of the Volunteer Force of the United States Army for the Years 1861, '62, '63, '64, '65 (Part VII), published by order of the Secretary of War in compliance with the Joint Resolution of the Senate and House of Representatives, approved 2 March 1865, Adjust General's Office, United States Army, Washington, District of Columbia, 16 July 1867, p. 377.\"Francis B.

In addition, he regularly won money from fellow soldiers in foot races, which he never lost. After being released from the Army, Prine returned to Linn County. In 1867, he married Elizabeth \"Eliza\" Sylvester. He remained in Linn County until the area became too crowded for his liking.Lent, Steve, Images of America Prineville, Arcadia Publishing, Charleston, South Carolina, 2006, p. 11-12. == Central Oregon pioneer == In 1868, he moved east of the Cascade Mountains to the Ochoco country of central Oregon. He made a squatters claim on property along the Crooked River, near Mill Creek. He was 27 years old at that time.An Illustrated History of Central Oregon: Embracing Wasco, Sherman, Gilliam, Wheeler, Crook, Lake, and Klamath Counties, State of Oregon, Western Historical Publishing Company, Spokane, Washington, 1905, p. 723.Brogan, Phil F., East of the Cascades, Binford and Mort Publishers, Portland, Oregon, 1965, pp. 128-129. His wife was one of the first women to settle in the area. Their first son was born at their homestead site a year later.Lent, Steve, Images of America Crook County, Arcadia Publishing, Charleston, South Carolina, 2013, p. 16. When he arrived in central Oregon, Prine built a crude cabin using juniper and willow logs, topped with a thatched roof of willow stems and ryegrass turf. He also opened a primitive blacksmith shop and a small store. He hauled goods for his store from The Dalles on the Columbia River while he salvaged iron from abandoned wagons for his blacksmith shop. Prine later added a saloon and a stable to his property. After the stable was built, he began keeping race horses there. Eventually, he laid out a course along the river for horse racing. He regularly sponsored horse races to boost liquor sales at his saloon. At that time, central Oregon was a wild frontier area without any formal law enforcement. According to Prine, property theft and murder were common. Prine noted that this problem was solved by lynching thieves and murderers.Coonc, Elizabeth Ann, \"Reminiscences of a Pioneer Woman\", The Washington Historical Quarterly (Volume VIII, Number 1), Washington University State Historical Society, Tacoma, Washington, January 1917, p. 19. In 1871, the Prine post office was established. Later that year, Prine sold his Crooked River property and businesses to Monroe Hodges for $25 and a packhorse. The following year, the name of the post office was changed to Prineville. After taking over Prine's businesses, Hodges platted the Prineville town site. Prineville became the county seat for Crook County when that county was created by the Oregon State Legislature in 1882.\"Crook County History\", Oregon Blue Book, Oregon State Archives, Oregon Secretary of State, Salem, Oregon accessed 26 November 2017.Carey, Charles H., History of Oregon (Volume 1), Pioneer Historical Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois, 1922, p. 768.Pedersen, Nathan, \"Prineville\", Oregon Encyclopedia, Portland State University and Oregon Historical Society, Portland, Oregon, 4 April 1917.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, \"Prineville\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 785. After selling his property at the Prineville town site, Prine moved to Weston in northeastern Oregon. He became Weston's city marshal and later opened a blacksmith shop there.\"Barney Prine the Pioneer Blacksmith\", advertisement, Weston Weekly Leader, Weston, Oregon, 21 January 1890, p. 4. While visiting Boise, Idaho in 1876, Prine became a local hero by rescuing a young girl from a wagon being dragged by a team of runaway horses. Riding up next to the out- of-control wagon, he pulled the girl to safety just before the wagon crashed into a tree.\"A Fearful Ride\", Idaho Statesman, Boise City, Idaho, 7 September 1876, p. 5. \"Oldhand A Head\", Idaho Statesman, Boise City, Idaho, 9 September 1876, p. 3. == Later life and legacy == In the mid-1890s, Prine began prospecting for gold in unsettled parts of eastern Oregon. He was particularly interested in finding the Lost Blue Bucket Mine, which he believed was located somewhere between the Owyhee River and the headwaters of the Crooked River. He later explored the mining country of northeastern Washington, northern Idaho, and southern parts of British Columbia.\"The County News\", Athena Press, Athena, Oregon, 11 December 1896, p. 4.\"The Founder of Prineville\", State Rights Democrat, Albany, Oregon, 29 October 1897, p. 4. Eventually, Prine settled in the small community of Lapwai in the Idaho panhandle. Once again, he opened a blacksmith shop. He ran that business successfully for the next 20 years. Prine died in Lapwai on 17 March 1919.\"Francis B Prine\", United States Veterans Administration Pension Payment Cards, 1907-1933, citing NARA microfilm publication M850, FHL microfilm 1,635,854; National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, District of Columbia, accessed 14 November 2017. Today, Prine is considered the founder of Prineville, Oregon. The city is still the county seat of Crook County. == References == == External links == * Oregon Blue Book history of Crook County History * Category:1841 births Category:1919 deaths Category:American city founders Category:People from Jackson County, Missouri Category:People from Lapwai, Idaho Category:People from Prineville, Oregon Category:People of Oregon in the American Civil War Category:Businesspeople from Idaho Category:Businesspeople from Oregon Category:American blacksmiths Category:People from Linn County, Oregon ",
