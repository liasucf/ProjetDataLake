He has a gang of friends for whom he conducts parties in his home every weekend. He is known to the people as an artist. He makes his living by purchasing drawings from fine arts college students and selling them at higher cost with his name signed to those pictures. Later it becomes known that Sassi is suffering from fourth stage liver cancer due to his drinking habit and has only six months to end his life. He chooses to put his trademark on earth by ordering for a \"smart\" coffin to cremate him and converts to Christianity for the same. Later problems arise when some critics raise the issue that the coffin is much bigger than the original one and cannot be allowed to be cremated. He feels that all his efforts have gone in vain and leaves the place. On the way he leaves the coffin to float in the water and moves away with his life. == Cast == *Sreenivasan as Sassi Namboothiri *Divya Gopinath as Sreelatha *S. P.
