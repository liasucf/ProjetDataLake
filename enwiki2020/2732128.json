    "text": "San Mam\u00e9s Stadium ( ; also known as La Catedral , \"The Cathedral\"), was a football stadium in Bilbao, Biscay, Spain. The stadium was the home of Athletic Bilbao, known as Los Leones de San Mam\u00e9s-Bilboko lehoiak (The Lions of San Mam\u00e9s). They are known as Los Leones because their stadium was built near a church called San Mam\u00e9s (Saint Mammes). Mammes was an early Christian, born in A.D. 259, who was thrown to the lions by the Romans. The club's new stadium, of the same name, was inaugurated on 16 September 2013.Colocan la primera piedra en San Mam\u00e9s Barria, GaraA new Cathedral: Athletic Club\u2019s move to a new San Mam\u00e9s, Simon Lloyd, Joe.co.uk ==History== Opened in 1913, until its demolition it was Spain's oldest stadium (the oldest playing field being El Molin\u00f3n)Estadio El Molin\u00f3n, StadiumDB a characteristic that gave rise to the nickname La Catedral (The Cathedral), together with its revered status as one of the nation's most important venues, the devotion shown by the team's followers who attended the matches, the site's religious heritage and the fact that the city itself did not have a cathedral for some years afterwardsSan Mam\u00e9s: The Stadium, Athletic BilbaoSan Mam\u00e9s, la eterna Catedral del f\u00fatbol espa\u00f1ol (San Mam\u00e9s, the eternal Cathedral of Spanish football), FIFA, 24 May 2013 (Santiago Cathedral did not receive the distinction until 1949). The nickname of the stadium is unconnected to the building that appears on the club crest, which is the Church of San Ant\u00f3n and its bridge, also featured on the Bilbao city coat of arms. The first match at the stadium in August 1913 was a friendly between Athletic and Racing Club de Ir\u00fan in a replay of the 1913 FEF Copa del Rey Final, which was the opening game of a triangular tournament also involving Shepherd's Bush F.C. The first goal was scored by the famous striker Pichichi.

In March 2006, a project was approved to replace the stadium with a new and larger version, thereby increasing the stadium capacity to 53,000. The New San Mam\u00e9s Stadium is built on the former site of the Bilbao International Trade Fair, adjacent to the current stadium. Construction began in April 2010, and after it was three quarters completed, Athletic Club moved into their new home and the original San Mam\u00e9s was demolished. AC/DC's final concert of their Black Ice World Tour was held in the stadium, on 28 June 2010, it was the last gig of the legendary guitarist and co-founder Malcolm Young. ===Final months=== The last Athletic match in La Liga at the stadium was a 0\u20131 loss to Levante on 26 May 2013; the goalscorer was Juanlu in stoppage time. Therefore the final Athletic scorer was Fernando Llorente in the previous home fixture against Mallorca. However, the last competitive game took place on 2 June 2013 when the reserve team Bilbao Athletic (who occasionally play important matches away from their small stadium at the club training ground) drew 2\u20132 with Levante's reserves in their promotion play-offs. On 5 June 2013, Athletic played a farewell friendly match at the stadium to mark its closure, against a Biscay XI (a team comprising players born in the province based with other clubs). Athletic introduced several old heroes back onto the field as substitutes in the later stages: Orbaiz, Guerrero, Andrinua, Dani and Iribar, while others were also in attendance including 94-year-old Rafael Iriondo. Several of the Biscay players had begun their careers at Athletic, such as Exp\u00f3sito, Arriaga, Azkorra, Tarantino and Unai Medina, plus Be\u00f1at and Etxeita who had both already agreed to rejoin the club. Bizkaia won 1\u20130, with the last-ever goal being scored by Alain Arroyo. In the days following the match, demolition of the stands began. By the time of its official centenary date in August 2013, little remained of the old stadium as work intensified to clear the site and complete its replacement. The iconic arch over the main stand of the stadium (which originally supported its roof) was preserved in the demolition and moved in several pieces to the club's training ground, Lezama, where it was installed at the side of the pitch used by the reserves and women's team.
