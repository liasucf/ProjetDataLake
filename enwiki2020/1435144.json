    "text": "The Baldwin DR-4-4-15 was a cab unit-type diesel locomotive built for freight service by the Baldwin Locomotive Works between November 1947 and June 1950. It was produced in two different body types, nicknamed the \"Babyface\" and \"Sharknose\" styles by railfans, though Baldwin used the same model number for both. 22 \"Babyface\" cab-equipped A units were built, along with 11 cabless booster B units; 36 \"Sharknose\" A units and 36 B units were constructed, making a total for all models of 105 locomotives built. ==Original buyers== ===\"Babyface\" units produced (1947-1948)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
