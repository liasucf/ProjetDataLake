Nueva Ecija Representative Rodolfo Antonino, panel chairman, said that the panel has sent out invitations to all police officers who went to Russia, retired national Police comptroller Eliseo de la Paz and Local Governments Secretary Ronaldo Puno.

The panel is also reviewing reports of the Philippine National Police and the Napolcom. ==Findings== A team of investigators led by Assistant Ombudsman Joselito Fangon has recommended the filing of graft charges against former Philippine National Police (PNP) comptroller Eliseo de la Paz and his colleagues. The investigators also recommended the filing of similar charges against former PNP Director General Avelino Razon Jr. and several top officials including Samuel Rodriguez, Orlando Pesta\u00f1o, Tomas Rentoy III, Elmer Pelobello, Romeo Ricardo, Emmanuel Carta, Ismael Rafanan, German Doria, Silverio Alarcio Jr., and Jaime Caringal. Based on their findings however, investigators said the amount came from \u201cprivate funds.\u201d The team said the PNP officials violated section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.

The recommended charges were falsification of public documents, prolonging of performance of duties, violation of the passport law, obstruction of the apprehension and prosecution of criminal offenders, perjury, and violation of the New Central Bank Act. ==Charges== In 2010, the office of the Ombudsman filed graft charges against twelve former and active ranking PNP officials for their alleged involvement in the incident.Kristine L.
