A monotypic genus, it consists of the single clavarioid species Setigeroclavula ascendens, found on the dead rachis of mother spleenwort (Asplenium bulbiferum) in New Zealand. Both the genus and species were described in 1988 by mycologist Ron Petersen. The small, club-shaped fruitbodies are densely studded with erect hairs. The hyphal system is monomitic; the spores are smooth and hyaline (translucent). ==See also== *List of Agaricales genera ==References== ==External links== * Category:Clavariaceae Category:Agaricales genera Category:Fungi of New Zealand Category:Taxa named by Ron Petersen ",
