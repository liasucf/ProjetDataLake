    "text": "Abraham Aguilar (died 1794) was a British slave trader of Portuguese Jewish descent. Aguilar was the only known Jewish slave factor in Kingston, Jamaica in the 1760s and 1770s, and he operated with other non-Jewish merchants in the firm of Coppells & Aguilar. In 1789, he had a large detached house built at 24, West Side, Wimbledon Common, London, now known as The Kier. When Aguilar's will was proved in 1794, he also owned property in London's Devonshire Square. ==References== Category:1794 deaths Category:British Jews Category:British slave traders Category:Judaism and slavery Category:People from Wimbledon, London Category:18th-century Sephardi Jews Category:Spanish and Portuguese Jews ",
