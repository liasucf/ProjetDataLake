Rodrigues Alves never even entered office, for he was stricken by the \"Spanish flu\" and died on 16 January 1919. Delfim Moreira himself also did not have good health, suffering from some psychological conditions, therefore his short tenure was known as \"the republican regency\" since the government Minister of Transportation and Public Works, Afr\u00e2nio de Melo Franco, stood out in the president's decision- making. Three days after the new government took over the country, a general strike hit the capital and the city of Niter\u00f3i. The president ordered the closure of unions in Rio de Janeiro, on 22 November. On 21 June 1919, a dissident faction of the anarchists founded the Brazilian Communist Party. Four months later, the government expelled from the country about a hundred of them, mostly foreigners, who worked in the workers movement of the cities of S\u00e3o Paulo, Santos, Rio de Janeiro and Niter\u00f3i, due to the discovery of an alleged plot aimed at overthrowing the government. When Epit\u00e1cio Pessoa assumed headship of the government, Moreira became his Vice President. As Vice President, he also served as the President of the Senate. He died in the city of Santa Rita do Sapuca\u00ed, on 1 July 1920. He was succeeded by Bueno de Paiva. Venceslau Br\u00e1s declares war against the Central Powers in October, 1917.
