When a television broadcaster is granted a licence, a callsign is allocated. For commercial networks, these are generally three letters. The first two letters are selected by the licensee; and the third letter indicates the state or territory the station is located in. Sometimes the third letter is used as part of the acronym or mnemonic to name the station - for example GTV (General Television Corporation) represents 'General TeleVision' or 'General TV', although the V stands for Victoria. Callsigns in Australia do not include ITU prefixes. If one is required, \"VL\" is used. So, for example, GTV in an international context would actually be 'VLGTV'. With the onset of aggregation in regional areas, and now digital television, the callsigns do not retain the meaning that they did in the past. Stations will sometimes change frequency, or have different frequencies at different locations, such as re-transmission sites, where the same signal is re-broadcast in a different area. However the three letter codes have generally not changed and are still used within the industry. A list of callsigns is shown below, with original explanations of the callsigns: ==New South Wales/Australian Capital Territory== ===Sydney=== * ABN - Australian Broadcasting Corporation New South Wales * ATN -
