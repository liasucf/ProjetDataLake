Maisonneuve, October 28, 2010. best known for her work in experimental forms such as prose poetry and New Narrative.\"Writing-Translating (from) the In- Between: An Interview with Gail Scott\". Studies in Canadian Literature, Volume 31, Number 2 (2006). She was a major contributor to 1980s Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise feminist language theory, known as \u00e9criture au f\u00e9minin, which explores the relationship between language, bodies, and feminist politics. Many of her novels and stories deal with fragmentation in time, in subjects, and in narrative structures. Born in Ottawa, Ontario in 1945,Lianne Moyes, Gail Scott: Essays on Her Works. Guernica Editions, 2002. . p. 231. Scott was raised in a bilingual community in rural Eastern Ontario and educated in English and Modern Languages and French literature at Queen's University and the University of Grenoble, respectively, before moving to Montreal, Quebec in 1967, where she was involved in leftist and ind\u00e9pendantiste movements of the 1970s. Initially working as a journalist, she was a founding editor of publications such as The Last Post, Des luttes et des rires des femmes, Spirale and Tessera. Beginning in 1980, she taught journalism at Concordia University until 1991, and published novels and essay collections. Many of Scott's works explore her experience as an anglophone involved in Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise political and literary movements. Scott, along with other Qu\u00e9becoise feminist literary theorists like Nicole Brossard and France Th\u00e9oret, published La th\u00e9orie, un dimanche, a collection of essays and creative work that explores the gendered writing subject in language. Her prose work draws heavily on poetic forms and structures, and was anthologized in Prismatic Publics: Innovative Canadian Women's Poetry and Poetics (2009). In an interview published on Lemon Hound, Scott said: \"I like to think of each sentence\u2014as much as possible\u2014as a performative unit. A call. The space between the sentences is where the audience or reader bridges with her energy, and in her way, the gap. My debt to poetry has to do with resisting the passive reader.\" Her works have been noted for their experimental sentence structures and their emphasis on syntax. She was a nominee for the Governor General's Award for French to English translation at the 2001 Governor General's Awards for The Sailor's Disquiet, her translation of Michael Delisle's Le D\u00e9sarroi du matelot.\"The kindest cut of all: The G-G's shortlist\".
