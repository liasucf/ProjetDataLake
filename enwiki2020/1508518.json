    "text": "length of the vector projection. Vector projection of a on b (a1), and vector rejection of a from b (a2). In mathematics, the scalar projection of a vector \\mathbf{a} on (or onto) a vector \\mathbf{b}, also known as the scalar resolute of \\mathbf{a} in the direction of \\mathbf{b}, is given by: :s = \\left\\|\\mathbf{a}\\right\\|\\cos\\theta = \\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{\\hat b}, where the operator \\cdot denotes a dot product, \\hat{\\mathbf{b}} is the unit vector in the direction of \\mathbf{b}, \\left\\|\\mathbf{a}\\right\\| is the length of \\mathbf{a}, and \\theta is the angle between \\mathbf{a} and \\mathbf{b}. The term scalar component refers sometimes to scalar projection, as, in Cartesian coordinates, the components of a vector are the scalar projections in the directions of the coordinate axes. The scalar projection is a scalar, equal to the length of the orthogonal projection of \\mathbf{a} on \\mathbf{b}, with a negative sign if the projection has an opposite direction with respect to \\mathbf{b}. Multiplying the scalar projection of \\mathbf{a} on \\mathbf{b} by \\mathbf{\\hat b} converts it into the above-mentioned orthogonal projection, also called vector projection of \\mathbf{a} on \\mathbf{b}. ==Definition based on angle \u03b8== If the angle \\theta between \\mathbf{a} and \\mathbf{b} is known, the scalar projection of \\mathbf{a} on \\mathbf{b} can be computed using :s = \\left\\|\\mathbf{a}\\right\\| \\cos \\theta . (s = \\left\\|\\mathbf{a}_1\\right\\| in the figure) ==Definition in terms of a and b== When \\theta is not known, the cosine of \\theta can be computed in terms of \\mathbf{a} and \\mathbf{b}, by the following property of the dot product \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}: : \\frac {\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}} {\\left\\|\\mathbf{a}\\right\\| \\, \\left\\|\\mathbf{b}\\right\\|} = \\cos \\theta \\, By this property, the definition of the scalar projection s \\, becomes: : s = \\left\\|\\mathbf{a}_1\\right\\| = \\left\\|\\mathbf{a}\\right\\| \\cos \\theta = \\left\\|\\mathbf{a}\\right\\| \\frac {\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}} {\\left\\|\\mathbf{a}\\right\\| \\, \\left\\|\\mathbf{b}\\right\\|} = \\frac {\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}} {\\left\\|\\mathbf{b}\\right\\| }\\, ==Properties== The scalar projection has a negative sign if 90 < \\theta \\le 180 degrees. It coincides with the length of the corresponding vector projection if the angle is smaller than 90\u00b0. More exactly, if the vector projection is denoted \\mathbf{a}_1 and its length \\left\\|\\mathbf{a}_1\\right\\|: : s = \\left\\|\\mathbf{a}_1\\right\\| if 0 < \\theta \\le 90 degrees, : s = -\\left\\|\\mathbf{a}_1\\right\\| if 90 < \\theta \\le 180 degrees. ==See also== * Scalar product * Cross product * Vector projection Category:Vectors (mathematics and physics) ",
