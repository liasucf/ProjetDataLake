In their monograph on the Lycaenopsis group of polyommatine genera, Eliot & Kawazoe, 1983, list 14 taxa as valid subspecies names, plus many further synonyms to which they accord lesser status. According to Eliot & Kawazoe, 1983, these 14 subspecies are divided into four groups as follows: ;The argiolus group Palaearctic & North African *C. a. argiolus *C. a. bieneri *C. a. hypoleuca :=paraleuca Rober *C. a. mauretanica :=algirica Oberthur ;The kollari group South and South-East Asian *C. a. iynteana :=sikkima Moore :=victoria Swinhoe :=herophilus Fruhstorfer :=cition Fruhstorfer :=bothrinoides Chapman :=puspargiolus Chapman :=albocaeruloides Chapman *C. a. kollari :=kasmira Moore :=coelestina Kollar :=trita Swinhoe ;The ladonides group Far Eastern *C. a. caphis :=crimissa Fruhstorfer *C. a. ladonides :=levettii Butler :=sachalinensis Esaki :=heringi Kardakoff *C. a. sugurui ;The ladon group North and Central American *C. a. cinerea :=arizonensis Edwards *C. a. echo *C. a. gozora *C. a. ladon :=pseudargiolus Boisduval :=violacea Edwards :=neglectamajor Tutt *C. a. lucia :=neglecta Edwards :=marginata Edwards :=argentata J. Fletcher ==Common names== In India, C. argiolus is known as the hill hedge blue. In North America, the ladon group of subspecies are known as the spring azure. In addition the name echo blue is used for the western subspecies, C. a. echo.
