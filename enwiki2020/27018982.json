Richard Kestenbaum spent over 30 years as an investment banker at several firms, most recently at Drexel Burnham Lambert where he was a partner, and a boutique firm called Financo, Inc. Errol Glasser was a Managing Director responsible for West Coast investment banking activity at Kidder Peabody and a Principal in The Trump Group, a privately held New York-based investment company.

Kestenbaum began his career at Drexel Burnham Lambert where he was a partner in the firm's New York office. Following the collapse of Drexel, Kestenbaum left to join Financo, Inc. where he served as managing director conducting the majority of that firm\u2019s apparel transaction business during his 10-year tenure there. Kestenbaum has also written three books on finance and computer science and taught International Business at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. Glasser is a native of South Africa, but came to the U.S. in 1978 after qualifying as a Chartered Accountant. He began his finance career at Revlon in corporate development. After joining Kidder Peabody in 1986, Glasser quickly rose in the ranks, joining the Operating Committee in 1991 and became the head of West Coast banking. After leaving Kidder, Glasser went out on his own, purchasing and running several different companies before getting back into investment banking. He has served on numerous boards including Tyco Toys, Montgomery Ward, Pay \u2018n Save, Telescene and Regency Affiliates. In April 2018, Triange Capital Corporation entered into a purchase agreement with an affiliate of Benefit Street Partners LLC for its December 31, 2017 investment portfolio to funds advised by BSP. The transaction was completed on July 31, 2018, and the company sold substantially all of its investment portfolio for gross cash proceeds of $739.3 million. ==Business Services== Triangle Capital\u2019s primary role is providing advice to middle market companies relating to mergers and acquisitions. Much of its work is sell-side engagements where the firm is hired to sell a company for its owners. Triangle Capital is also actively involved in raising capital for companies that are looking to grow, or want to recapitalize. Triangle Capital has also been working to establish a foothold in China, believing that an increasing level of investment and M&A; activity will be emanating from Chinese apparel manufacturers seeking to buy U.S. brands. Chinese manufacturers have a clear opportunity to move up the value chain by getting closer to the end consumer. It will also enable them to bring an established U.S. brand to the Chinese marketplace.JOSH KOSMAN and JAMES COVERT, \"New York Post\", August 4, 2011, \"Source 2\", August 8, 2011 Triangle Capital is in a unique position to apply its in depth knowledge of the U.S. apparel, merchandising and retail market to assist these Chinese manufacturers in their endeavors. Kestenbaum was recently highlighted in a Forbes article written about Alibaba's 11Main.Com site.https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2014/08/13/alibabas-11main-com- site-is-a-flop/ In addition, the firm has worked with distressed firms in and out of bankruptcy. Triangle also includes fairness opinions among its services.
