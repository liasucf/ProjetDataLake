    "text": "General Tr\u1ea7n Thi\u1ec7n Khi\u00eam (born 15 December 1925) was an officer in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam War. He was born in Saigon, Cochinchina, French Indochina (now Vietnam). During the 1960s he was involved in several coups. He helped President Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m put down a November 1960 coup attempt and was rewarded with promotion. In 1963 he was involved in the coup that deposed and assassinated Di\u00eam. He later joined with Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh to stage a successful January 1964 coup. In the next few months, the Catholic Khi\u00eam fell out with Kh\u00e1nh, whom he accused of being too heavily influenced by Buddhist activists. Khi\u00eam tried to plot against Kh\u00e1nh, but was thwarted. He was implicated in the organization of the September 1964 coup attempt by Generals L\u00e2m V\u0103n Ph\u00e1t and D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n \u0110\u1ee9c, both also Catholics, and was sent into exile to serve as Ambassador to the United States. In February 1965, Colonel Ph\u1ea1m Ng\u1ecdc Th\u1ea3o, who had accompanied him to Washington had returned to Saigon and launched a coup with Ph\u00e1t. This was done with Khi\u00eam's support. The coup failed but other officers took the opportunity to force Kh\u00e1nh into exile. Khi\u00eam would return to Vietnam when the political climate among the generals was more favourable and became Prime Minister under President Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u, resigning only in the last month before the fall of Saigon. ==Career== Khi\u00eam graduated from the Vietnamese National Military Academy in \u0110\u00e0 L\u1ea1t on 12 July 1947. He became a 1st Lieutenant in June 1948 and served in the Vietnamese National Army of the French-backed State of Vietnam of Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i, which fought the Vi\u1ec7t Minh of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. Khi\u00eam was appointed captain in 1951 and major in July 1954. In 1957, as a colonel, he became a Deputy Chief of General Staff/Logistics and served as acting Chief of Joint General Staff in October. From 1957 to 1958 he attended the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in the United States, and upon his return, served as 4th Field Division Commander until February 1960. In September, he switched to command the 5th Division, which at the time was based in M\u1ef9 Tho.Tucker, pp. 526\u201333. ==1960 defence of Di\u00eam against coup== alt=A portrait of a middle-aged man, looking to the left in a half-portrait/profile. He has chubby cheeks, parts his hair to the side and wears a suit and tie. On 11 November 1960, Colonels V\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n \u0110\u00f4ng and Nguy\u1ec5n Ch\u00e1nh Thi launched a coup attempt against President Di\u00eam, but after surrounding the palace, they stopped attacking and decided to negotiate a power-sharing agreement. Di\u00eam falsely promised reforms, allowing time for his loyalists to come to the rescue. The rebels had failed to seal the highways into the capital to block loyalist reinforcements.Jacobs, pp. 115\u201318. Khi\u00eam was a Roman Catholic with ties to Di\u00eam's older brother, Archbishop Th\u1ee5c; Di\u00eam was also Khi\u00eam's godfather.Kahin, p. 125. Khi\u00eam brought in tanks from the Second Armored Battalion from M\u1ef9 Tho, a town in the Mekong Delta, south of Saigon.Moyar (2006), p. 110.Jacobs, p. 118. As the false promises of reform were being aired, Khi\u00eam's men approached the palace grounds. Some of the rebels switched sides as the power balance changed.Moyar (2006), p. 113. After a brief but violent battle that killed around 400 people, the coup attempt was crushed.Langguth, pp. 108\u20139. Khi\u00eam was made a brigadier general after serving as the head of the 21st Division, and was appointed Chief of Staff of the combined armed forces and made a major general in December 1962.Hammer, p. 133. ==1963 coup against Di\u1ec7m== One of Khi\u00eam's subordinates, Ph\u1ea1m Ng\u1ecdc Th\u1ea3o, a Communist double agent, was planning one of the many coup plots that engulfed Saigon and destabilised the regime, with the help of Tr\u1ea7n Kim Tuy\u1ebfn.Shaplen, pp. 197\u201398. Th\u1ea3o's plans were shelved when an American CIA agent, Lucien Conein, instructed Khi\u00eam, to stop the coup on the grounds that it was premature.Karnow, p. 300.Hammer, p. 264. Th\u1ea3o was actually a communist double agent whose involvement in the plotting is generally attributed to cause infighting within the ARVN whenever possible. He later joined the main plot, of which Khi\u00eam was part.Karnow, p. 317. As Di\u00eam was known for his ability to outwit coup plotters, those is the plot did not fully trust each other. On the morning of the coup, an emotional Khi\u00eam approached General T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t \u0110\u00ednh with tears welling in his red eyes and asked him to keep their conversation confidential. After the III Corps commander agreed, Khi\u00eam claimed he wanted to cancel the coup, saying \"\u0110\u00ednh, I think we still have time to talk to the old man. I don't want to hurt him. Have pity on him!\" \u0110\u00ednh contemplated the situation and said that he would proceed.Moyar, p. 266. Khi\u00eam then reported this to \u0110\u00f4n, and claimed that he had placed Chinese medicinal oil into his eyes to irritate and redden them and thus give the appearance he had become remorseful about the coup, in order to test \u0110\u00ednh's loyalty to the plot. Both Minh and \u0110\u00f4n were still wary of Khi\u00eam and \u0110\u00ednh's loyalty up to the last minute, as both were Catholics who were favourites of the Ng\u00f4 family, who had been rewarded for their loyalty not competence. Khi\u00eam was Di\u00eam's godson. The other generals were still worried that \u0110\u00ednh might switch sides and go through with the second part of Nhu's fake coup, and that Khi\u00eam's alleged test on \u0110\u00ednh was simply done to deflect suspicion on him. The generals were also concerned they would not have enough forces to overcome the loyalists. During the coup, Th\u1ea3o commanded some tanks, which surrounded Gia Long Palace and helped launch the full-scale attack at 03:30 on 2 November. At daybreak Th\u1ea3o's forces stormed the palace, but found it empty; Di\u00eam and Nhu had escaped. A captured loyalist revealed the brothers' hiding place and under the orders of Khi\u00eam, Th\u1ea3o went after them. Khi\u00eam ordered Th\u1ea3o to ensure the brothers were not physically harmed.Hammer, p. 292. Th\u1ea3o arrived at the house in Cholon where the brothers were hiding and brought in a convoy to arrest them.Shaplen, pp. 209\u201310. The brothers were subsequently executed en route to military headquarters despite being promised safe exile, apparently on the orders of General D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh.Jacobs, p. 180. Di\u00eam's aide-de-camp, Lieutenant \u0110\u1ed7 Th\u01a1 had earlier urged Di\u00eam to surrender, saying he was sure that his uncle \u0110\u1ed7 M\u1eadu, along with \u0110\u00ednh and Khi\u00eam, would guarantee their safety. Th\u01a1 wrote in his diary afterwards that \"I consider myself responsible for having led them to their death\".Hammer, p. 294. ==1964 coup against Minh== After the 1963 coup, the key figures took the choice jobs in the Military Revolutionary Council, and Khi\u00eam was demoted from being Chief of Staff of the armed forces to the commander of the III Corps that surrounded Saigon. Khi\u00eam controlled the 5th and 7th Divisions of the ARVN, which were based in Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a and M\u1ef9 Tho, north and south of Saigon respectively.Shaplen, p. 231. Khi\u00eam was disgruntled and easily recruited into another coup. The coup plot was initiated by Brigadier General \u0110\u1ed7 M\u1eadu, who had been the head of military security under Diem and had a thorough knowledge of the backgrounds of most of the senior officers and their strengths and weaknesses.Shaplen, p. 230. The MRC feared M\u1eadu and placed him in the relatively powerless post of Minister of Information. M\u1eadu began to seek out other slighted officers, including Khi\u00eam, Generals Kh\u00e1nh and Thi, who had returned from exile after Di\u00eam's death. As the coup plot began to solidify, Kh\u00e1nh came to the fore of the group. It has been concluded by some analysts that Khi\u00eam \u2013 who went on to be Kh\u00e1nh's second in command in terms of real power after the coup was successful \u2013 was more pre- eminent during the early phases of the planning, but as a Catholic who had been rapidly promoted by Di\u00eam after converting, he \"did not dare to carry out a coup d'etat himself out of fear that the Buddhists would react strongly against him and accuse him of trying to reestablish the Ng\u00f4 Regime\". Another factor seen as vital in bringing Kh\u00e1nh to the forefront of the coup group was the fact that the US military leadership deemed Kh\u00e1nh more capable than Khi\u00eam and equally likely to work in accordance with U.S. interests. Kh\u00e1nh was highly regarded by Harkins, who thought of him as \"the strongest of all corps commanders\". According to a CIA assessment, Kh\u00e1nh had been \"consistently favorable to U.S. programs and advice\".Kahin, p. 196. Khi\u00eam, Kh\u00e1nh and M\u1eadu kept in touch surreptitiously on a regular basis, supplementing their forces with an assortment of Marine, Air Force and Special Forces officers.Shaplen, pp. 231\u201332. They scheduled the coup for 0400, 30 January.Karnow, p. 352. According to the plan, Khi\u00eam's III Corps forces would surround the homes of the sleeping junta members in Saigon while Kh\u00e1nh and a paratrooper unit would occupy the military headquarters at Tan Son Nhut Air Base. On the night of 29 January, Khi\u00eam ordered troops to assume their positions around Saigon, including armored cars and tanks and some elements from the 5th and 7th Divisions.Shaplen, p. 233. Khi\u00eam then went to sleep. Kh\u00e1nh headed to the staff headquarters, where he saw that the compound was empty apart from a few guards. When he telephoned Khi\u00eam, he found that his co-conspirator had overslept after having forgotten to set his alarm clock. Despite this, by daybreak, Kh\u00e1nh had taken over without a shot being fired. Generals D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh, Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n \u0110\u00f4n and L\u00ea V\u0103n Kim woke up to find Khi\u00eam's men surrounding their houses and thought it to be a quixotic stunt by some disgruntled young officers, having had no inkling of the plot. Kh\u00e1nh put them under house arrest, later charging them with neutralism.Langguth, p. 278. In a morning radio broadcast Kh\u00e1nh said he had conducted the coup because of the junta's failure to make progress against the Viet Cong. After the coup, Khi\u00eam became Defense Minister and the Chairman of Joint General Staff while serving on the junta. ==Junta infighting== In August 1964, after Kh\u00e1nh decided to take more power for himself by declaring a state of emergency and introducing a new constitution, Buddhists launched protests against the new junta, claiming that there was a plot to revive the Di\u00eam era by predominantly Catholic groups such as C\u1ea7n Lao veterans and \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t supporters, pinpointing Khi\u00eam and Thi\u1ec7u, both Catholics who had been favoured by Di\u00eam. Kh\u00e1nh's concessions to the Buddhists sparked opposition from Khi\u00eam and Thi\u1ec7u, who tried to remove Kh\u00e1nh in favour of Minh, recruiting other officers. Khi\u00eam said \"Kh\u00e1nh felt there was no choice but to accept since the influence of [Th\u00edch] Tr\u00ed Quang was so great that he could not only turn the majority of the people against the government but could influence the effectiveness of the armed forces\".McAllister, p. 763. They sought out Taylor and sought a private endorsement for a coup against Kh\u00e1nh, but the U.S. ambassador did not want any more changes in leadership, fearing a corrosive effect on the government. This deterred Khi\u00eam's group from toppling Kh\u00e1nh.Moyar (2004), p. 763. The division among the generals came to a head at a meeting of the MRC on 26/27 August. Kh\u00e1nh claimed the instability was due to troublemaking by members and supporters of the Catholic-aligned \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t (the Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam), which he accused of putting partisan plotting ahead of the national interest. Prominent officers associated with the Dai Vi\u1ec7t included Thi\u1ec7u and Khi\u00eam.Kahin, pp. 229\u201330. Khi\u00eam blamed Kh\u00e1nh's concessions to Buddhist activists as the reason for the demonstrations and the rural losses to the communists.Moyar (2006), p. 318. Thi\u1ec7u and another Catholic, General Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u00f3, called for the replacement of Kh\u00e1nh with Minh, but the latter refused. Minh reportedly claimed that Kh\u00e1nh was the only one who would get funding from Washington, so they support him, prompting Khi\u00eam to angrily say \"Obviously, Kh\u00e1nh is a puppet of the US government, and we are tired of being told by the Americans how we should run our internal affairs\". After more arguing between the senior officers, they agreed on 27 August that Kh\u00e1nh, Minh, and Khi\u00eam would rule as a triumvirate for two months, until a new civilian government could be formed. The trio then brought paratroopers into Saigon to end the rioting. However, the momentum petered out due to the lack of unity in the ruling triumvirate. Kh\u00e1nh dominated the decision-making, sidelining Khi\u00eam and Minh.Moyar (2004), pp. 760\u201363. Kh\u00e1nh blamed Khi\u00eam for organizing a failed coup attempt led by Generals L\u00e2m V\u0103n Ph\u00e1t and D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n \u0110\u1ee9c on 13 September.Kahin, pp. 228\u201335. General Cao, a Catholic and former Di\u1ec7m loyalist, claimed in a 1972 newspaper interview that Khi\u00eam, by then prime minister, had asked him to join the coup. Cao claimed that he declined Khi\u00eam's invitation, mildly mocking him by asking \"You're part of the 'Troika' now ... won't you be overthrowing yourself?\", and pointing out that a political upheaval in Saigon would be a bad idea because Vietnam was prominent during the ongoing U.S. presidential election campaign and negative publicity could lead to weakening US public and political support for South Vietnam.Kahin, p. 498. Khi\u00eam's lack of public action was seen as tacit support for the coup;Kahin, p. 231.Moyar (2006), pp. 316\u201319. A U.S. Embassy log during the coup claimed that the Thi\u1ec7u and Khi\u00eam \"seem so passive that they appear to have been either tacitly supporting or associated with his move by \u0110\u1ee9c and Ph\u00e1t\", and that Khi\u00eam had \"issued expressions of firm support for Kh\u00e1nh somewhat belatedly\", as control was eventually reestablished.Kahin, pp. 229\u201332. ==Plotting from overseas== By the end of the year, Kh\u00e1nh had prevailed in the power struggle with Khi\u00eam and Minh. He despatched Khi\u00eam to Washington as ambassador, being convinced Khi\u00eam was destabilizing Saigon.Kahin, p. 232. In late December 1964, Kh\u00e1nh summoned Th\u1ea3o back to Saigon. Th\u1ea3o suspected Kh\u00e1nh was attempting to have him killed, while Kh\u00e1nh thought that Th\u1ea3o and Khi\u00eam were plotting against him.Tucker, p. 325.Tang, pp. 56\u201357. Fearing that he would be arrested upon arrival, Th\u1ea3o attempted to outmanoeuvre Kh\u00e1nh and went underground to plot.Shaplen, pp. 308\u201309. In the meantime, Khi\u00eam had been putting pressure on Kh\u00e1nh while serving as his ambassador by charging him and the Buddhists of seeking a \"neutralist solution\" and \"negotiating with the communists\".Kahin, p. 300. In January 1965, the junta-appointed Prime Minister Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n H\u01b0\u01a1ng introduced a series of measures to expand the military and war effort by widening the terms of conscription. This provoked widespread anti-H\u01b0\u01a1ng demonstrations and riots across the country, mainly from conscription-aged students and pro- negotiations Buddhists.Kahin, pp. 267\u201369. Reliant on Buddhist support,Moyar (2004), pp. 774\u201375. Kh\u00e1nh decided to have the armed forces take over. On 27 January, he removed H\u01b0\u01a1ng in a bloodless coup.Moyar (2006), p. 775. Kh\u00e1nh's deposal of H\u01b0\u01a1ng nullified a counter-plot involving H\u01b0\u01a1ng that had developed during the civil disorders. In an attempt to pre-empt his deposal, H\u01b0\u01a1ng had backed a plot led by some \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t-oriented Catholic officers, including Thi\u1ec7u and Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u00f3. They planned to remove Kh\u00e1nh and bring Khi\u00eam back from Washington, D.C. The U.S. Embassy in Saigon was privately supportive of the aim, but not ready to fully back the move as they regarded it as poorly thought out and potentially a political embarrassment due to the need to use an American plane to transport some plotters, including Khi\u00eam, between Saigon and Washington.Kahin, p. 297. By this time the U.S. relationship with Kh\u00e1nh had broken downKahin, pp. 255\u201360. and the U.S. became more intent on a regime change as Kh\u00e1nh was reliant on Buddhist support, which they saw as an obstacle to an expansion of the war.Kahin, pp. 294\u201396. In the first week of February, Taylor told the leading officers that the U.S. was not supporting Kh\u00e1nh,Kahin, p. 298. and they thought that Khi\u00eam was a possible replacement although not among the most preferable. However, the candidates favoured by the Americans fell behind Th\u1ea3o in their planning.Kahin, p. 299. On 19 February, Th\u1ea3o and General L\u00e2m V\u0103n Ph\u00e1t began their coup attempt, seizing the military headquarters, the post office and radio station.Moyar (2006), p. 363.VanDeMark, p. 81.Tang, p. 363. Th\u1ea3o made a radio announcement stating that he would remove the \"dictator\" Kh\u00e1nh, and would recall Khi\u00eam to Saigon to lead the junta. Although Khi\u00eam was part of the plot, the timing of Th\u1ea3o's announcement caught Khi\u00eam off-guard, asleep in his Maryland home. When informed of what was happening, Khi\u00eam sent a cable pledging \"total support\" to the plot. Th\u1ea3o had planned for \u0110\u00f4n to become Defense Minister and Chief of Staff of the military, but the Dai Vi\u1ec7t insisted on installing the Catholic Khi\u00eam. During the announcement of the coup, Ph\u00e1t and others made pro-Di\u00eam speeches and hardline Catholic statements.Kahin, pp. 299\u2013300. By this time, Khi\u00eam was preparing to return to Saigon to join in on the action or take over if it became successful. His colleagues had anticipated that the Americans would give them an aircraft so that Khi\u00eam could return to Vietnam, but second thoughts arose among Taylor and Westmoreland. The two American generals had lost confidence in Kh\u00e1nh, but the pro-Di\u00eam political ideology being expressed by Th\u1ea3o's supporters on radio alienated them, as they feared that the coup plotters would destabilize and polarize the country in they took power.Kahin, p. 301. The U.S. wanted Kh\u00e1nh out, but were worried that Ph\u00e1t and Th\u1ea3o could galvanize support for the beleaguered Kh\u00e1nh through their extremely divisive pro-Di\u00eam views, which had the potential to provoke large-scale sectarian divisions in South Vietnam. The Marine Brigade commander, General L\u00ea Nguy\u00ean Khang, appealed to the US Embassy in Saigon to not allow Khi\u00eam to depart the U.S. As a result of this, Taylor messaged the State Department that \"Regardless what ultimate outcome may be we feel Khi\u00eam's arrival here ... would only add tinder to what this evening appears to be very explosive situation with possibilities of internecine strife between armed forces units ... Urge he not try return [to] Saigon until situation more clarified.\" After a day of chaos, the coup collapsed when, anti-coup forces swept into the city. Whether the rebels were defeated or a deal was struck to end the revolt in exchange for Kh\u00e1nh's removal is disputed, but most believe the latter as the plotters had met K\u1ef3 beforehand and the collapse was rather orderly.Moyar (2006), p. 364.VanDeMark, p. 82. Although the coup failed and Khi\u00eam did not return, the Armed Forces Council adopted a vote of no confidence in Kh\u00e1nh and Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3, and Thi became the most powerful figures in the junta. In the meantime, Th\u1ea3o and Ph\u00e1t were sentenced to death in absentia. Thao was hunted down and killed in mysterious circumstances by other factions with the military leadership,Shaplen, pp. 310\u201312.Langguth, pp. 346\u201347. while Ph\u00e1t evaded capture for a few years before surrendering and receiving a pardon from Thi\u1ec7u. Despite his failure to take power, Khi\u00eam said he was \"very happy. I think my objective has been realized.\"Kahin, p. 514. The new junta decided to ignore Khi\u00eam's involvement in the coup and he remained in Washington as the ambassador, with no further action taken.Kahin, p. 303. In October 1965 the junta of K\u1ef3 and Thi\u1ec7u made Khi\u00eam the Ambassador to Taiwan; he served there until mid-1968, then returned to Vietnam and served under President Thi\u1ec7u as Interior Minister for a year before becoming Deputy Prime Minister at the start of 1969. In September 1969 he became prime minister and defense minister, and he stayed in the role until April 1975 when he resigned and left the country as the communists were in the process of completing their victory over South Vietnam. However, he had little power as Thi\u1ec7u operated virtually one-man rule.Willbanks, pp. 240\u201360. ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== *ARVN Generals' Name List Category:1925 births Category:Living people Category:Army of the Republic of Vietnam generals Category:Prime Ministers of South Vietnam Category:Vietnamese Roman Catholics Category:Leaders who took power by coup ",
