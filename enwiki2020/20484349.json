    "text": "Microheaters are small high-power heaters, with precise control, that can offer temperatures in excess of 1000C, even up to 1900C.http://www.mhi- inc.com/Microheaters.htm. Microheaters provide for accurate high temperature control, for example in electron microscopes, pressure-anvil cells or for enhancing fiberheaters.A. I. Kalachev, D. N. Nikogosyan, and G. Brambilla, \"Long-Period Fiber Grating Fabrication by High-Intensity Femtosecond Pulses at 211 nm,\" J. Lightwave Technol. 23, 2568- (2005) Generally speaking, the heating method for microheaters involves conversion of electrical work to high density heat. With the increase in the temperature demanded, microheater heating materials change from metallic (non-brittle GAXP) to metal-ceramic like materials (MoSi2) which tend to be brittle. With an increase in usable temperature, microheaters need to be supported or enclosed with very high thermal-resistant ceramic materials often made from small grain, high purity aluminum oxide. Other potential uses include: * Fuel Cell Heat Sources, * Electronics and Substrate Heating, * RF Applications, * Micro tube-heaters for small volume gas heating, * High Power micro-furnace with optional tube extension, * Fiber optics, * Ideal for long aspect ratio/very small diameter pieces, * Fiber optic use to reduce diameter of fibers, * Igniter, * MicroPlate heaters, * Material Testing and Characterization, * Thermal Property Measurements, * Diamond Anvil Cells, * SEM/TEM/AFM, * Gas/Vapor Heaters/Converters, * Thin Film Preparation, When microheaters need controls it is important to heat only electrically, so that power may be controlled by a feed-back mechanism. New superheated steam or gas spot heaters are coming into use for spot microheater applications. == References == Category:Heaters ",
