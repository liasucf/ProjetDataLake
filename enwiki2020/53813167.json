    "text": "Marie Edmonds (born 14 September 1975) is a Professor of volcanology and geology at the University of Cambridge whose research focuses on the physics and chemistry of volcanic eruptions and magmatism and understanding volatile cycling in the solid Earth as mediated by plate tectonics. She is interested in the social and economic impacts of natural hazards; and the sustainable use of Earth's mineral and energy resources. Professor Edmonds is the Vice President and Ron Oxburgh Fellow in Earth Sciences at Queens' College, Cambridge; and the Deputy Head of Department and Director of Research at the Earth Sciences Department, University of Cambridge. == Early Career and Education == Edmonds was born in Plymouth, Devon on 14 September 1975 and is the daughter of Philip Edmonds and Jenny Clark (n\u00e9e Pethick). She was educated at Plymouth High School for Girls, Plymouth, Devon (1987-1994). She obtained a BA Honours degree (a double first) in Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge in 1997, specialising in Geological Sciences. She began her PhD studies the same year at Cambridge, under Professors David Pyle and Clive Oppenheimer. Her thesis was entitled 'Sulfur and chlorine emissions from the Soufriere Hills Volcano, Montserrat' and she graduated with the PhD degree in 2002. == Career == After receiving her PhD she served as a volcanologist for the British Geological Survey at its Montserrat Volcano Observatory. From 2004 to 2006 Edmonds was a Mendenhall Fellow with the US Geological Survey at its Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. From 2006-2006 she was Reader at the University of East Anglia School of Environmental Sciences. She is now a Fellow of Queens' College (since 2007) and a Professor at the University of Cambridge, where she teaches igneous petrology, geochemistry, and volcanology. Edmonds has held a number of leadership roles within the Natural Environment Research Council of the UK and the Geological Society of London. Edmonds served on the Deep Carbon Observatory's (DCO) Executive Committee, chairs the Synthesis Group 2019 where she is charged with synthesizing and integrating DCO science in the lead-up to the finale of the decadal program in 2019. Edmonds is also the co-Chair of DCO's Reservoirs and Fluxes Directorate of DCO. Edmonds served as secretary for science 2014\u20132018 at the Geological Society of London and was the Volcanology, Petrology Secretary of the American Geophysical Union 2016\u20132018.. Edmonds is a principal editor of the AGU journal Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems (G-Cubed). == Honours and Awards == Edmonds received the 2014 William Smith Fund of the Geological Society of London, the 2017 Wager Medal of the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior, the 2019 ThermoFisher VMSG annual award and the 2019 Daly Lecture of the American Geophysical Union. == Family == Edmonds married Richard Angus Herd in 2009 and together they have two children, Edward and Anna. == References == Category:Living people Category:British geologists Category:Alumni of the University of Cambridge Category:Academics of the University of Cambridge Category:Fellows of Queens' College, Cambridge Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
