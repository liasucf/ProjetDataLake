    "text": "is a 2015 Japanese comedy anime television series by Pierrot, based on Fujio Akatsuka's 1962 manga series, Osomatsu-kun. Celebrating Akatsuka's eightieth birthday, the series follows the sextuplet Matsuno brothers from the original series as adults, and features more adult-oriented humor compared to the original series. The series aired in Japan between October 2015 and March 2016, with a special episode airing in December 2016. A second season aired between October 2017 and March 2018. A third season premiered in October 2020. Both seasons have been licensed in Americas by Viz Media. A manga adaptation by Masako Shitaro began serialization in Shueisha's You magazine from January 2016. A theatrical anime film premiered on March 15, 2019. ==Premise== The original Osomatsu-kun series followed the Matsuno brothers; Osomatsu, Karamatsu, Choromatsu, Ichimatsu, Jyushimatsu, and Todomatsu, who are all identical sextuplets who cause mischief. Mr. Osomatsu depicts the brothers as being ten years older than their original counterparts (with the action taking place in a contemporary setting). All of the brothers have now grown up into lazy NEETs, with each brother having developed their own distinguishing personality. The series follows the brothers in their everyday (and occasionally made up) lives. ==Characters== ===Matsuno siblings=== The Matsuno siblings as depicted in Mr. Osomatsu. From left to right: Todomatsu, Osomatsu, Karamatsu, Choromatsu, Ichimatsu, and Jyushimatsu. ====Osomatsu Matsuno==== is the eldest of the sextuplets and self-proclaimed leader of the group. An avid gambler, he spends his time playing pachinko and betting on horses. He often dresses in red. ====Karamatsu Matsuno==== is the second born of the sextuplets. Believes himself to be cooler and more popular than he really is and calls his fan girls \"Karamatsu Girls.\" He occasionally adds English words into his sentences. His distinguishing feature is his thick eyebrows and he often dresses in blue, though he occasionally sports a leather jacket and sunglasses. ====Choromatsu Matsuno==== is the third born and most responsible of the sextuplets. Often acts as straight man to his siblings. His distinguishing features are his angular mouth, smaller pupils, and his lack of a cowlick. He often dresses in green. ====Ichimatsu Matsuno==== is the fourth born of the sextuplets and the sharp-tongued loner of the group. His distinguishing features are his tired eyes, scruffy hair, hunched back, and he often dresses in purple. ====Jyushimatsu Matsuno==== is the fifth born of the sextuplets. He is very energetic but also quite the airhead, often having no reaction to the wild goings-on. He has a wide open mouth, and a single cowlick compared to the other siblings' two. He often dresses in yellow. ====Todomatsu Matsuno==== is the most outgoing of the sextuplets. Often uses his cuteness as a brother to manipulate others. He has a smaller mouth, and bigger pupils.
