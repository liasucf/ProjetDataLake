The DeKi 600 is one of the few locomotives that Meitetsu possesses: while the company used to engage in the freight business and still possesses some freight locomotives, it no longer carries freight on a regular basis. Meitetsu is famous for its red trains, including its famous 7000 series \"Panorama Car\" which was retired in 2009 after a career lasting nearly half a century. The most recent cars, however, are not solid red but rather brushed steel as in the case of the 4000 series and 5000 series, or white as in the case of the 1700 series and 2000 series. The following are the train types that Meitetsu operates today, as well as selected types that Meitetsu has retired. ===Limited express=== * 1200 and 1230 series \"Panorama Super\" * 1800/1850 series * 1700/2300 series * 2000 series \"\u03bc-Sky\" * 2200 series ===Commuter=== Meitetsu 5000 series commuter train * 100/200 series * 300 series * 3100/3500/3700 series * 3150/3300 series * 4000 series * 5000 series (2008) * 5300/5600/5700 series * 6000/6500/6800 series * 9500 series ===Withdrawn train types=== Meitetsu 7000 series \"Panorama Car\" train * 1380 series * 1600 series \"Panorama Super\" * 7000 series \"Panorama Car\" * 5000 series (1955) === Electric locomotives=== * Meitetsu DeKi 300 * Meitetsu DeKi 400 * Meitetsu DeKi 600 * Meitetsu Class EL120 == History == While Meitetsu is an old company in its own right, it has over time acquired many small railway and interurban companies in the area surrounding Nagoya. Meaning many lines that belong to modern-day Meitetsu were constructed and operated by other companies, mostly in the prewar and wartime period. For example, it acquired its K\u014dwa Line on the Chita Peninsula from its merger with Chita Railroad on February 1, 1943 and it acquired its Mikawa Line from its merger with Mikawa Railroad. However, the company that became modern Meitetsu was Aichi Horsecar Company, founded on . ==References== ==External links== *Nagoya Railroad (English Official Site) *Nagoya Railroad (Japanese Official Site) *Museum Meiji Village Category:Companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Category:Companies based in Nagoya Category:Japanese companies established in 1921 Category:Railway companies established in 1921 ",
