Jazz Aviation provides regional and charter airline services in Canada and the United States, primarily under contract to Air Canada using the brand name Air Canada Express, and also as Jazz Charters. It is Canada's third-largest airline in terms of fleet size (but not in terms of passengers carried annually, number of employees, or destinations served). Its Air Canada Express operations serve 79 destinations in Canada and the United States. Under a capacity purchase agreement, Air Canada sets the Jazz route network and flight schedule, and purchases all of Jazz's seat capacity based on predetermined rates. Its main base is Halifax Stanfield International Airport, with hubs at Toronto Pearson International Airport, Victoria International Airport, Vancouver International Airport, Montr\u00e9al\u2013Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, and Calgary International Airport. Prior to April 2011, Air Canada's regional operations were branded as Air Canada Jazz. Following the award of a contract to Sky Regional Airlines, the Air Canada Express brand was introduced as an umbrella for all regional operations. The Jazz brand is now entirely managed by Jazz Aviation LP. ==History== ===Corporate history=== Headquarters of Jazz in Enfield, Nova Scotia, 2011 Air Canada Regional Inc. was established in 2001 from the consolidation of the Air Canada Connector carriers Air BC, Air Nova, Air Ontario, and Canadian Regional Airlines (shortly after the merger between Canadian Airlines and Air Canada). The merger was finalized in 2002 with the creation of a new brand: Air Canada Jazz. In 2006, ACE Aviation Holdings, the owners of Air Canada, sold off all of its Air Canada Jazz assets. Air Canada Jazz was then an independent company known as Jazz Air Income Fund, which launched an initial public offering in February 2006; units of the income trust traded as JAZ.UN. On 15 November 2010, the airline was restructured and changed its name to Chorus Aviation, became a public corporation, and traded as \"CHR\" at the Toronto Stock Exchange. In 2011, Air Canada announced it would phase out the use of the \"Air Canada Jazz\" name and livery, and instead brand its regional operations as \"Air Canada Express\", with the subtitle \"operated by Jazz\". The contract between Jazz and Air Canada is currently in effect until 2035. ===Operational history=== In February 2006, Air Canada announced that City Centre Aviation Limited (CCAL) had served a 30-day termination notice for Jazz's month-to-month lease of terminal space at Toronto City Centre Airport. The Toronto Port Authority itself does not control any significant terminal space at the airport, but it extended permission for Jazz to continue using the airport; however, since the airline could not find terminal space, they cancelled service to the airport at the end of February 2006. CCAL had been bought by REGCO Holdings, (now Porter Aviation Holdings), the owners of Porter Airlines, which launched service from the airport later that year. In August 2008, Jazz Air removed all life jackets from its aircraft to lower fuel costs. According to the airline, passengers are to use floating seat cushions in the event of an emergency over water. The airline also stated that the probability of a water landing on the regional airline routes was almost zero, as no operation over great bodies of water occurs except for the Great Lakes and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and that in all circumstances, the airline always remains within from land, as stipulated in the law, which removes the obligation from carrying any flotation devices. ==Other ventures== ===Thomas Cook Canada=== In April 2010, Jazz Aviation LP had reached an agreement with Thomas Cook Group to operate a fleet of at least six Boeing 757-200 aircraft during the winter 2010/2011 season.Jazz Air in agreement with Thomas Cook Canada The deal with Thomas Cook Group followed the collapse of Canadian airline Skyservice, which previously operated aircraft for Thomas Cook during the winter season. The aircraft, which were leased from UK operator Thomas Cook Airlines, were used on flights to destinations in the Caribbean, Mexico, and Central America. On September 30, 2010, it was announced that the deal had been extended until 2015. Sunquest charter service to sun destinations operated by Jazz Aviation, doing business as Thomas Cook Canada, began on November 5, 2010. However, on April 13, 2012, Thomas Cook Canada had terminated the remaining three years of the five-year flight services agreement with Jazz, and the service ended on April 30, 2012. For the 2011/2012 season, flights departed from the Canadian airports of Toronto, Halifax, Calgary, and Vancouver.Thomas Cook Canada Route Map - Winter 2011/2012 Destinations included Aruba, Nassau, Puerto Plata, Punta Cana, Montego Bay, Cancun, Cozumel, Puerto Vallarta, Los Cabos, and Cura\u00e7ao. ===PLUNA L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Uruguayas S.A.=== In April 2010, Jazz Air purchased a one-third interest in the Latin American Regional Aviation Holding Corporation (LARAH). In turn, LARAH owns a 75% interest in Uruguayan flag carrier PLUNA, while the remaining 25% is owned by the Uruguayan government. PLUNA said on July 6, 2012, that it was \"suspending all flights indefinitely\" and announced that 720 of the 900 staff would be sent on unemployment pay until a new associate for the company is found or the airline is definitively sold.PLUNA Press Release ==Destinations== Jazz serves 79 destinations across Canada and the United States. ==Fleet== Jazz CRJ-200 in Air Canada Jazz livery Jazz Dash 8-300 in Air Canada Jazz livery Jazz Dash 8-400's in the old Air Canada Express Livery Jazz Dash 8-400 in the new Air Canada Express Livery The Jazz fleet consists of the following aircraft as of July 2020: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;text-align:center\" |+ Jazz Aviation LP fleet |- ! rowspan=2 style=\"width:160px;\"| Aircraft ! rowspan=2 style=\"width:65px;\"| In service ! rowspan=2 style=\"width:60px;\"| Orders ! colspan=3| Passengers ! rowspan=2| Notes |- ! style=\"width:25px;\"| J ! style=\"width:25px;\"| Y ! style=\"width:25px;\"| Total |- |De Havilland Dash 8-300 |23 |\u2013 |\u2013 |50 |50 |Operated for Air Canada Express.
