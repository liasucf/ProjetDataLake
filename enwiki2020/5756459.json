It also revealed that the buyer of Miss Attitude, American financier Gary Klesch, claimed to have bought the debt-laden business for \u00a31. However, independent articles noted that it may have been a \"deliberate character-assassination attempt.\" Singh himself told Sathnam Sanghera of the Financial Times that, \"these stories are just rumours based on jealousy and are a total misrepresentation\", adding that a confidentiality clause prohibited him from discussing the matter.Sathnam Sanghera interviews Reuben Singh He then, suffered somewhat of a backlash from the media. The Manchester Evening News, which had previously printed positive stories about Singh, began to run negative pieces and sought to expose any discrepancies in his affairs. The paper alleged that he had used the press to his advantage, using inaccurate reports about his business prowess to further inflate his reputation as a successful entrepreneur. MP Graham Stringer called for tighter regulations after Singh was able to gain a position on a Government advisory panel without any prior checks. Another company set up by Singh, a health food company called Robson & Steinberg, folded after less than a year of trading, with debts of \u00a3250,000.Cosmetic success: The fallen business star \u2013 Home News, UK \u2013 Independent.co.uk Questions were raised about what Singh called the 'Reuben Singh Group of Companies.' According to Singh, these were 12 trading entities dealing in currency trading, property, retail and construction. However a search in the Britain, Companies House listed only two British companies with any net assets of \u00a31000 and \u00a3100. The other five British companies that Singh was listed as the director had never filed any accounts but the concern was raised on a \u00a32.64m payment that Singh paid overseas from one of the companies. Further problems arose in relation to a multimillion-pound overdraft which Singh had guaranteed. In 2004 he was sued by the Royal Bank of Scotland, with judge Michael Kershaw QC ordering Singh to pay the bank \u00a31,229,966 for an overdraft and their legal costs. The judge commented, \"(The banker) was, I think, to some extent a victim of Mr Singh's personality as well as Mr Singh's lies.\" ==References== Category:British businesspeople Category:People from Poynton Category:1976 births Category:Living people ",
