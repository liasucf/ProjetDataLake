He won the 2018 Volvo China Open. ==Professional career== Bj\u00f6rk turned professional in 2009 and played on the Swedish Golf Tour and the Nordic Golf League , where he won his first event as a professional, the Swedish PGA Championship, before moving on to the Challenge Tour, where he won the Le Vaudreuil Golf Challenge, in July 2016.http://www.alexanderbjork.com/about.html Following eight top-ten finishes including a tie for second at the Terre dei Consoli Open, he ended the season ranked seventh on the 2016 Challenge tour Order of Merit, securing a card for the European Tour. At the time, in November 2016, he reached a rank of 181 on the Official World Golf Ranking. In 2012, Bj\u00f6rk became the first golfer to list himself through Trade in Sports, an exchange for athletes, funding the launch of his professional career by pledging 10% of winnings to investors. On the 2017 European Tour, Bj\u00f6rk shared the lead with Peter Uihlein heading into the final round of Open de France, an Open Qualifying Series and Rolex Series event with a purse of US$7 million. He eventually finished tied for third, which earned him a spot at the 2017 Open Championship and saw him rise to 116 on the OWGR. In the opening tournament of the 2018 European Tour, Bj\u00f6rk shared the lead heading into the final round of UBS Hong Kong Open, but shot his second in the bunker on 18 and missed a short putt for par and a play-off, finishing tied for second. He rose to a world ranking of 110. In April 2018, the week after he finished third at Troph\u00e9e Hassan II, Bj\u00f6rk won his first European Tour title at the Volvo China Open in Beijing, moving into the top ten of the 2018 Race to Dubai rankings and a world ranking of 73. In October he was runner-up in the Sky Sports British Masters and he finished the season 19th in the Order of Merit. Bj\u00f6rk had less success in 2019 and 2020. He was tied for third at the Hero Open in August 2020, his best finish since 2018. ==Professional wins (5)== ===European Tour wins (1)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No.!!
