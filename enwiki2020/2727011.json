    "text": "The Revolutionary Communist Party of Turkey (, TDKP) is a clandestine communist party in Turkey. TDKP considers itself to be the continuation of the People's Liberation Army of Turkey (in Turkish: , THKO). The THKO Conference gathered in October 1978. It changed the name of the organisation to that of Revolutionary Communist Party of Turkey - Construction Organisation (TDKP-\u0130\u00d6 short for \u0130n\u015fa \u00d6rg\u00fct\u00fc).See English text on tdkp.org website; accessed on 17 September 2010 The split with the pro-Soviet line of the THKO, called M\u00fccadelede Birlik ('Unity in Struggle') in 1974 is also shown as its roots.Taken from an article by Garbis Alt\u0131no\u011flu ; accessed on 17 September 2010 Between 1976 and 1979 the followers of THKO gathered around a legal publication called Halk\u0131n Kurtulu\u015fu (People's Liberation) and are often known by that name.Taken from the German publication of the organisation Swiss Refugee Aid, dated April 1997 and reproduced under http://ob.nubati.net/wiki/TDKP; accessed on 17 September 2010 THKO passed through two splits, Bes Par\u00e7ac\u0131lar left in 1976 and THKO-Aktanc\u0131lar in 1977.A look at Family Tree of the Radical Turkish Left may be helpful. Bes Par\u00e7ac\u0131lar reunited with TDKP-I\u00d6 in 1979. The TDKP-I\u00d6 formally founded TDKP at a congress on 2 February 1980.see this website, in Turkish; accessed on 17 September 2010 TDKP adhered to the political line of the Albanian Party of Labour.Compare expertise opinion of the German section of Amnesty International of October 2004; accessed on 17 September 2010 ==Publications== Since 1975 THKO published the journal Yolda\u015f/Heval (Turkish/Kurdish for \"Comrade\"). It was only distributed to members. After the foundation of TDKP-\u0130\u00d6 the journal Devrimin Sesi (Voice of Revolution) was published legally. The journal Parti Bayra\u011f\u0131 (Flag of the Party) was another legally published monthly that appeared between 1978 and the military intervention in 1980. ==Development after 1980== In the 1970s the TKHO had a legal youth organization, known as YDGD (short for Patriotic Revolutionary Youth Association). 1976 the GKB (Gen\u00e7 Kom\u00fcnistler Birli\u011fi - Union of Young Communists) was created. Like the Emek\u00e7i Kad\u0131nlar Birli\u011fi (Union of Female Workers) it was no legal formation. In the second half of the 1980s, TDKP was riddled with internal strife. Three factions split away from it, accusing the leadership of reformism; Revolutionary Communist Party of Turkey-Socialist Unity (TDKP-SB) in 1987, Revolutionary Communist Party of Turkey-Leninist Wing (TDKP-DK, also known as \"Ekim\" after its newspaper) in 1988 and Revolutionary Communist Workers Movement of Turkey (TDKIH) in 1989. After the fall of Socialist Albania TDKP started looking more towards establishing legal structures. Emek Partisi (Labour Party) was banned in March 1996 shortly after its foundation. In its place Eme\u011fin Partisi (Labour Party) was founded later changing its name to Emek Partisi (generally called EMEP) again. TDKP is an active participant in the International Conference of Marxist-Leninist Parties and Organizations. ==External links== * TDKP ==See also== *List of illegal political parties in Turkey *Communist Party of Turkey (disambiguation), for other groups using similar names ==References== Category:Communist parties in Turkey Category:International Conference of Marxist\u2013Leninist Parties and Organizations (Unity & Struggle) Category:Political parties established in 1980 Category:Banned political parties in Turkey Category:Hoxhaist parties Category:Banned communist parties ",
