    "text": "{| |} The Sabrewing Rhaegal is a proposed American unmanned cargo aircraft developed by Californian Sabrewing Aircraft. == Design == The hybrid electric vertical takeoff and landing full-size Rhaegal-A is powered by a turboshaft engine and has ducted fans, a wingspan, a gross-weight, a VTOL payload of in STOL mode, a maximum speed of and a range of at up to . A larger Wyvern could lift a VTOL payload of in STOL configuration. == Development == By February 2018, Sabrewing was to fly a 65%-scale vehicle in the fall. By February 2019, a one-eighth-scale model was going to be tested while the first full-size aircraft construction had begun, to fly by the end of 2019 and to enter service in 2023. By then, the Aleut Community of Saint Paul Island, Alaska, in the Bering Sea signed its first order for four Rhaegal and six larger Wyvern aircraft, to resupply Saint George Island, south. The half-scale Rhaegal-B was completed and officially revealed to the public during the U.S. Air Force \"Agility Prime\" program unveiling. At the January 2020 Vertical Flight Society symposium, Sabrewing announced a larger Rhaegal-B was being completed, to be revealed within weeks. With an increase in wingspan, fuselage length and maximum gross weight, payload increases by in VTOL and over in conventional take-off/landing. It should load a single LD1 or LD3 container, or two LD2 containers, through the nose without special cargo handling equipment. FAR Part 23 certification negotiations were to be completed within weeks, to deliver cargo autonomously in any weather and any airspace. ==See also== ==References== ==External links== * Category:United States cargo aircraft Category:Proposed aircraft of the United States ",
