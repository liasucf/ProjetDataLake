    "text": "Emanuel Briffa (born 13 February 1994) is a Maltese former footballer who played as a defender or midfielder and made one appearance for the Malta national team. ==Career== Briffa earned his first and only cap for Malta on 11 November 2015 in a friendly against Jordan. The match, which was played in Istanbul, finished as a 0\u20132 loss. In 2016, Briffa was charged in a Maltese court for match-fixing. However, he was acquitted as charges were filed prior to the expiration of a three-month window which is allotted for players to report irregularities to the relevant authorities. However, he was suspended by the Malta Football Association pending an investigation by UEFA. Briffa received a lifelong ban from UEFA on 9 January 2018 for match-fixing offences during the 2017 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification tournament (against Montenegro on 23 March 2016 and the Czech Republic on 29 March 2016). Five other Malta under-21 national team players were also disciplined. However, Briffa protested his innocence following the decision. ==Career statistics== ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !colspan=3|Malta |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |2015||1||0 |- !Total!!1!!0 |} ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Maltese footballers Category:Malta under-21 international footballers Category:Malta international footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Association football midfielders Category:Floriana F.C. players Category:Maltese Premier League players ",
