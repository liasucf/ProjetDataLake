It is manufactured at Volvo's plant in Poland. It was introduced at Busworld Kortrijk 2011.Ny hybridbuss fr\u00e5n Volvo Bussmagasinet.se 29 August 2011 Based on the Volvo 7900 Hybrid an extension is offered, which i.a. includes a roof- mounted device for occasional loading at stops. The manufacturer assumes that all buses at all end stations and also at some particularly busy stations stay a few minutes until the return or onward journey. As soon as a bus reaches an appropriately equipped stop, a loading unit attached to a pillar at the roadside lowers onto the coupling point mounted on the roof of the bus. The charging process ends as soon as the bus wants to continue or the battery is full. According to the manufacturer, this equipment allows (in addition to the brake energy recuperation) compared to conventional hybrid buses significantly extending the travel time in electric mode and a reduction in fuel consumption. The vehicle and the charging system were first presented to the public in September 2014 at the International Motor Show.
