The song is written by lead vocalist and pianist Zack Sawyer, and former lead guitarist Taylor Roberts cites The Joker as an inspiration. Roberts said: > While I'm not the author of the lyrics for \"Villain\", the song is about, > well, being the villain. We all have that side of us, deep down somewhere. > That side of you is there whether you want to believe that or not and > sometimes its just itching to break out and take control. Another aspect for > inspiration, at least on my side of things, would definitely be the Joker. > If you watch the lyric video, the main focus of the video is the Joker, the > lyrics to me describe the insanity and utter villainy that the Joker exudes > [...] \"Villain\" is the fifth track on the album and it has its own lyric music video on YouTube. Part of the lyrics in the original single, which was removed in the album version, is sang growling and it became the inspiration to name the band Wild Fire: \"I illuminate the night / I bring chaos to the empire / wildfire burning bright.\" The band chose to leave out the growling part in the album version and simply replace it with an instrumental break. == Track listing == All track listings taken from the original album cover. == Personnel == ;Band members * Zack Sawyer \u2013 vocals, guitars, piano * Taylor Roberts \u2013 guitars * Tyler Voss \u2013 bass * Cameron Alidor \u2013 drums ;Others * Matt LaPlant \u2013 backing vocals, producer, mixer and engineer * Matt Marciana \u2013 drums * George Mason \u2013 strings * Matt Waddle * Dustin Sisson == References == Category:2017 debut albums Category:Wild Fire albums ",
