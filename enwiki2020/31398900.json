The first footprint was enabling competition in the market by licensing the second telecom operator \u201cDu\u201d besides Etisalat, the first UAE telecom operator. This step resulted enhanced communications services and offered users more options and choices. However in order to increase profits for government licensed telecommunications companies the TRA has taken down several free to use services such as Skype and Discord. The TRA is able to do this anti-consumer practice due to the oligopoly of ISPs (Internet service providers) and the lack of net neutrality in the country. The TRA has also created the string(DotEmarat) as the official Arabic top level domain for the UAE. With the approval of ICANN, the (DotEmarat) was endorsed by the UAE Ministerial Council for Services as the definitive and representative domain name of the United Arab Emirates on the World Wide Web for its native language script. The eighteenth Plenipotentiary Conference (Guadalajara 2010) witnessed the second consecutive UAE election to membership in the ITU Council. The Global Technology Report issued by the World Economic Forum, ranked the UAE first in the Middle East and North Africa, moving ahead in the ranking by four positions to 23rd globally, and is a clear indication of the success of the UAE Government's efforts aimed at building a knowledge- based economy that is flexible and varied with a focus on innovation and excellence. In January 2010, the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority, in keeping with one of its core missions as manifested in safeguarding consumer rights and monitoring competition within the local telecommunications market, announced telecommunications' \"Competition Framework\". The \"Framework\", the first to be developed by TRA, provides a detailed outline benefiting telecommunications consumers by promoting and protecting competition through deterring Licensees from engaging in activities that may impede competition in the UAE telecommunications sector. The Authority is eager to apply the latest ICT technologies within its operations; a new spectrum management system was launched by the TRA in the UAE; the new system is the first of its kind in the Middle East and the second most up-to-date and powerful in the world in the area of spectrum management. The system includes 13 stations, which are capable to cover the UAE spectrum efficiently. == See also == * Botswana Communication Regulatory Authority * National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority * List of telecommunications regulatory bodies ==References== Category:Communications in the United Arab Emirates Category:Government agencies of the United Arab Emirates Category:Telecommunications regulatory authorities Category:Regulation in the United Arab Emirates ",
