Little attended Cane Hill College in Washington County for one term. Little taught school and studied law. He was admitted to the Arkansas bar in 1873, and in 1876 he was elected prosecuting attorney of the 12th Judicial District. He served in that position until 1882. Little married Elizabeth Jane Irwin on January 4, 1877, in Paris, Arkansas. ==Career== Little served in the Arkansas House of Representatives in 1884, and in 1886 was appointed judge in the Twelfth Judicial Circuit and served for four years.
