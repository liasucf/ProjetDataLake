    "text": "Until the Azalea Blooms () is a South Korean miniseries starring Yum Jung-ah and Yoo Tae-woong. It aired on KBS2 from January 5 to January 28, 1998. Based on the 1996 essay by Mansudae ballerina Shin Young-hee Until the Rhododendron Blooms, which portrays North Korean society during Kim Il-sung's regime, the show dramatize her life in the north of the peninsula, the public execution of Woo In-hee, a mistress of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, which she personally witnessed, and her defection to South Korea. The first two episodes achieved a viewership rating of 16-21%, but the series was criticized for being overly sensational, ridiculing North Korea and distorting the original work. The author herself, in early October, tried to stop the show from airing, filing an injunction against KBS for copyright infringement and asking for a halt of the production of the drama. Until the Azalea Blooms, remembered nowadays as one of the first entertainment programs that portrays North Korea without propaganda purposes, was negatively received by North Korea, which threatened to kill the staff and bomb KBS headquarters if the channel aired it, as the drama deals with corruption in the North. North Korea banned it too, but it has nevertheless circulated and people have been punished and executed for watching it. ==Cast== * Yum Jung-ah as Joo Myung-hee * Yoo Tae- woong as Kang Ryong-nam * Yoon Dong-hwan as Han Ji-wook * Park Geun-hyung as Oh Jin-woo * Jung Dong-hwan as Kim Jong-il * Heo Jin as Kim Kyong-hui * Park Woong * Park Won-sook * Jeong Wook as Hwang Jang-yup * Jeon Moo-song * Baek Yoon-sik * Kim Chung as Rim Hye-ok * Naomi * Heo Yoon-jung * No Hyun-hee as Geum-shil * Hong Seung-hee * Kim Ji-yeon as Kim Seung-hee * Choi Yeo-reum as Hee-sook * Park Geon-shik * Kim Il-woo * Kim Ji-won * Jo Seung-hee as Rim Sook-hee ==References== ==External links== * Category:Korean Broadcasting System television dramas Category:Korean-language television shows Category:1990s South Korean television series Category:1998 South Korean television series debuts Category:1998 South Korean television series endings ",
