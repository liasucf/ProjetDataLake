On his return to Hungary he was appointed to a teaching post in a Realschule (scientifically oriented high school) in Budapest, and in 1878 was admitted as a docent into the faculty of philosophy at the University of Budapest, where he became a full professor in 1895. From 1892, he also lectured on dramaturgy and esthetics at the National Theater Academy, and on the latter subject and on the history of civilization at the Francis Joseph Polytechnic. He was a corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and a member of the Kisfaludy Society, a major force in Hungarian literature. He was the father of Franz Alexander, a Hungarian- American psychoanalyst and physician, who is considered one of the founders of psychosomatic medicine and psychoanalytic criminology, and maternal grandfather of Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi, a Hungarian mathematician who made contributions in combinatorics, graph theory, number theory but mostly in probability theory. ==Works== Alexander's chief works are A philosophia t\u00f6rt\u00e9net\u00e9nek eszm\u00e9je, tekintettel a t\u00f6rt\u00e9netre \u00e1ltal\u00e1ban (The idea of the history of philosophy, in consideration of history in general, 1878); Kant. \u00c9lete, fejl\u0151d\u00e9se \u00e9s philosophi\u00e1ja (Life, development and philosophy, 1881); A XIX. sz\u00e1zad pesszimizmusa: Schopenhauer \u00e9s Hartmann (The pessimism of the 19th century: Schopenhauer and Hartmann, Budapest, 1884, prize essay). Alexander, together with Professor J\u00f3zef B\u00e1n\u00f3czi, later edited a seminal series of books on philosophers, the Filosofiai Ir\u00f3k T\u00e1ra, for which he did translations and annotations of Ren\u00e9 Descartes, David Hume, and the Prolegomena to Immanuel Kant. Jointly with B\u00e1n\u00f3czi, he translated Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. He was an active writer on matters of education, editing the pedagogical journal Magyar Tan\u00fcgy from 1882 to 1886. ==Exile and death== However, Alexander became pariah in the nationalistic, anti-Semitic environment of post-1919 Hungary and Mikl\u00f3s Horthy's government, and spent four years abroad. He died in Budapest in 23 October 1927. ==References== and from the Hungarian Wikipedia page. *V\u00e1lt\u00f3- \u00e9s keresztkapcsol\u00e1sok: a tud\u00e1sk\u00f6zvet\u00edt\u00e9s folyamatai a k\u00e9t vil\u00e1gh\u00e1bor\u00fa k\u00f6zti magyar \u00e9s n\u00e9met nyelv\u0171 kult\u00far\u00e1ban at Google Books Category:1850 births Category:1927 deaths Category:19th-century Hungarian male writers Category:Hungarian Jews Category:Hungarian academics Category:Hungarian philosophers Category:Hungarian translators Category:Philosophers of art Category:19th-century translators ",
