    "text": "The fasting Buddha, receiving the gift of Sujata in the bottom relief (Gandhara, 2nd century CE). Sujata, also Suj\u0101t\u0101, was a milkmaid, who is said to have fed Gautama Buddha a bowl of kheer, a milk-rice pudding, ending his six years of asceticism. Such was his emaciated appearance that she wrongly believed him to be a tree-spirit that had granted her wish of having a child. The gift provided him enough strength to cultivate the Middle Path, develop jhana, and attain Bodhi, thereafter becoming known as the Buddha. The village of Bakraur near Bodh Gaya is believed to be her home. The Sujata Stupa was dedicated to her there in the 2nd century BCE. ==Gallery== File:092 Cave 11, Buddha with Sujata from Side (33438497684).jpg|Sujata and the Buddha in Ajanta (Cave 11).
