    "text": "Krupnik (Polish, Belarusian) or Krupnikas (Lithuanian) is a traditional sweet alcoholic drink similar to a liqueur, based on grain spirit (usually vodka) and honey, popular in Poland, Belarus and Lithuania. In Poland it is grouped in the nalewka category of alcoholic beverages. Mass-produced versions of krupnik consist of 40\u201350% (80\u2013100 proof) alcohol, but traditional versions will use 80\u2013100% grain alcohol as the base. Honey, usually clover honey, is the main ingredient used to add sweetness, as well as up to 50 different herbs. There are many versions and some recipes have been passed down through generations; each producer typically uses their own recipe. Krupnik originated in the territories of present-day Belarus, which were at the time part of the larger Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Krupnik is sometimes heated before being served. Legend has it that the recipe was created by the Benedictine monks at a monastery in Nia\u015bvi\u017e (then known as Nie\u015bwie\u017c) which was founded by Miko\u0142aj Krzysztof \"Sierotka\" Radziwi\u0142\u0142. Known in Poland and Lithuania (including present-day Belarus) at least since the 16th century, it soon became popular among the szlachta of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. There are numerous recipes preserved up to present times in countless diaries of the szlachta. Krupnik was also used as a common medicinal disinfectant by Polish soldiers in World War II. At times, spicy seasonings and herbs are added for flavour. The brand of the honey and the ratio of seasonings are key factors which determine the final taste of krupnik. A mixture of the honey and spices is diluted, boiled and strained before being added to a vodka base. It may be served hot, at room temperature or chilled. A specific sort of krupnik which contains more herbs and less honey is brewed by Karaims. \"Krupnik\" is also the brand name of a range of alcoholic beverages produced by the Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re company, including krupnik, vodka, and various nalewki. In 2014, Krupnik vodka was the eighth most popular vodka brand in the world by sales volume. ==References== ==External links== * Krupnikas recipe on Recidemia Category:Belarusian liqueurs Category:Herbal liqueurs Category:Honey liqueurs and spirits Category:Lithuanian vodkas Category:Polish liqueurs Category:Polish vodkas Category:Belarusian vodkas ",
