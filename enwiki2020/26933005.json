A French squadron, seeking to join the Spanish fleet and a number of French ships of the line at the Spanish Atlantic base of Cadiz, sailed from Toulon on 13 June under Contre-amiral Charles Linois.Clowes, p. 458 Rounding the British naval base of Gibraltar on the southern coast of Spain on 4 July, Linois learned that a British squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir James Saumarez was on station off Cadiz. Seeking to avoid battle with Saumarez's much larger force, Linois anchored in the Spanish port of Algeciras, close to Gibraltar.Woodman, p. 161 Saumarez discovered Linois there on 6 July and attacked at 08:30, his ships hampered by light winds and Linois's strong defensive position.James, p. 115 During the battle, in which the French squadron was heavily supported by fire from Spanish shore batteries and gunboats, the British ship HMS Hannibal grounded and could not be refloated. Two of the French ships were also driven ashore, but the fire of the Spanish batteries and the lack of wind all contributed to Saumarez calling off the attack at 13:35, leaving Hannibal stranded and isolated. Captain Solomon Ferris was left with no option but to surrender as the remainder of the British force limped back to Gibraltar.Clowes, p. 464 Linois called on the Spanish forces in Cadiz for reinforcements and on 9 July a relief squadron was sent consisting of six ships of the line and two frigates under . Arriving on 9 July, this force anchored in Algeciras until Linois was ready to sail on 12 July, the large combined squadron departing westwards with the wind during the evening.Mostert, p. 407 Saumarez followed, sending HMS Superb to attack the Spanish rearguard. During the opening stages of the second battle Superb set the 112-gun Spanish ship Real Carlos on fire and captured the French Saint Antoine. Real Carlos later drifted into the San Hermenegildo, spreading the fire to her compatriot. Both ships exploded at 00:15 on 13 July with enormous loss of life.Gardiner, p. 93 The British squadron pressed on with the attack, and at 05:15 on 13 July HMS Venerable and HMS Thames attacked the French Formidable off the Spanish coast. In a fierce engagement, Formidable brought down Venerable's masts and drove the ship on shore, the French ship escaping with the rest of the squadron to Cadiz.Clowes, p. 468 Venerable was later salvaged and returned to Gibraltar, while Saumarez reinstated the British blockade of Cadiz.James, p. 130 ==First Battle of Algeciras== ===British squadron=== The British squadron was formed from the force enforcing the Cadiz blockade to ensure that the Spanish fleet stationed there did not put to sea. One ship from the squadron was absent during the battle; HMS Superb had been detached to the Guadalquivir River and, along with the frigate HMS Thames, did not reach Algeciras in time to participate, turning back to Cadiz on 6 July and observing the later movements of the combined squadron.James, p. 124 All of the British squadron was heavily engaged, but Hannibal and Pomp\u00e9e, isolated at the head of the British line by calm winds, took the heaviest damage. Pomp\u00e9e had to be towed to safety by the boats of the squadron and Hannibal was grounded and eventually forced to surrender. Between them Pomp\u00e9e and Hannibal took more than half of the total British casualties.Clowes, p. 465 {| class=\"wikitable\" width=100% |-valign=\"top\" !colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Rear-Admiral Saumarez's squadron |- valign=\"top\"|- valign=\"top\" ! scope=\"col\" width=15%; align= center rowspan=2 | Ship ! scope=\"col\" width=10%; align= center rowspan=2 | Rate ! scope=\"col\" width=5%; align= center rowspan=2 | Guns ! scope=\"col\" width=7%; align= center rowspan=2 | Navy ! scope=\"col\" width=21%; align= center rowspan=2 | Commander ! scope=\"col\" width=9%; align= center colspan=3 | Casualties ! scope=\"col\" width=33%; align= center rowspan=2 | Notes |-valign=\"top\" ! scope=\"col\" width=3%; align= center | Killed ! scope=\"col\" width=3%; align= center | Wounded ! scope=\"col\" width=3%; align= center | Total |- valign=\"top\" | align= left | HMS Caesar | align= center | Third rate | align= center | 80 | align= center | Royal Navy | align= left | Rear-Admiral Sir James Saumarez Captain Jahleel Brenton | align= right | | align= right | | align= right | | align= left | Badly damaged.

All three required extensive repairs before they were seaworthy. Murion was close inshore and thus only lightly damaged, but the Spanish batteries, gunboats and the town of Algeciras itself all suffered severe damage.James, p. 119 {| class=\"wikitable\" width=100% |-valign=\"top\" !colspan=\"9\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Contre-amiral Linois's squadron |- valign=\"top\" ! scope=\"col\" width=15%; align= center rowspan=2 | Ship ! scope=\"col\" width=10%; align= center rowspan=2 | Rate ! scope=\"col\" width=5%; align= center rowspan=2 | Guns ! scope=\"col\" width=7%; align= center rowspan=2 | Navy ! scope=\"col\" width=21%; align= center rowspan=2 | Commander ! scope=\"col\" width=9%; align= center colspan=3 | Casualties ! scope=\"col\" width=33%; align= center rowspan=2 | Notes |-valign=\"top\" ! scope=\"col\" width=3%; align= center | Killed ! scope=\"col\" width=3%; align= center | Wounded ! scope=\"col\" width=3%; align= center | Total |- valign=\"top\" | align= left | Formidable | align= center | Third rate | align= center | 80 | align= center | France | align= left | Contre-amiral Charles Linois Captain Laindet Lalonde | align= right | | align= right | | align= right | | align= left | Badly damaged |- valign=\"top\" | align= left | Desaix | align= center | Third rate | align= center | 74 | align= center | France | align= left | Captain Christy de la Palli\u00e8re | align= right | | align= right | | align= right | | align= left | Badly damaged and driven ashore |- valign=\"top\" | align= left | Indomptable | align= center | Third rate | align= center | 80 | align= center | France | align= left | Captain Augustin Moncousu | align= right | | align= right | | align= right | | align= left | Badly damaged and driven ashore |- valign=\"top\" | align= left | Muiron | align= center | Fifth rate | align= center | 40 | align= center | France | align= left | Captain Jules-Fran\u00e7ois Martinencq | align= right | | align= right | | align= right | | align= left | Lightly damaged |-valign=\"top\" !colspan=\"9\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Spanish defences |-valign=\"top\" |colspan=\"9\" align=\"left\"|The Spanish garrison of Algeciras provided 14 large gunboats and defensive positions at Bateria de San Iago (five cannon), Isla Verda (seven cannon), Fort Santa Garcia, Torre de la Vila Veija and Torre de Almirante.

It totaled five Spanish ships of the line and four French and was much larger than its British opponent. However, all of Linois's ships were badly damaged from the first battle and the captured Hannibal was so battered that Moreno ordered it to return to Algeciras with the frigate Indienne on 12 July. Neither took any part in the battle.James, p. 125 Much of the combined squadron was not engaged in the second battle, managing to escape Saumarez's pursuit and reach Cadiz safely. The rearguard of Rear Carlos, San Hermengildo and Saint Antoine was overwhelmed in the night however and Formidable only escaped after a fierce engagement on the Spanish coast the following morning.Gardiner, p. 93 {| class=\"wikitable\" width=100% |-valign=\"top\" !colspan=\"7\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Vice- Admiral Moreno's squadron |- valign=\"top\" ! scope=\"col\" width=15%; align= center | Ship ! scope=\"col\" width=10%; align= center | Rate ! scope=\"col\" width=5%; align= center | Guns ! scope=\"col\" width=7%; align= center | Navy ! scope=\"col\" width=21%; align= center | Commander ! scope=\"col\" width=9%; align= center | Casualties ! scope=\"col\" width=33%; align= center | Notes |- valign=\"top\"|- valign=\"top\" | align= left | Real Carlos | align= center | First rate | align= center | 112 | align= center | Spain | align= left | Captain Don J.
