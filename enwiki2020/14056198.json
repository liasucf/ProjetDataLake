Paul Masquelier, critic for the controversial review El\u00e9ments El\u00e9ments is one of the reviews of the ethnonationalist Groupement de recherche et d'\u00e9tudes pour la civilisation europ\u00e9enne. has pointed out the narcissistic or regressive aspects of his paintings, while conceding their social commentary and the feeling of joie de vivre they convey. However, the core of his artistic practice is elsewhere. Bicha Gallery outlined it as follows: \"Eric's work is more drawing than painting. It is a game with lines, first drawn in a spontaneous manner, random \u2013 much like a child doodling \u2013 then worked and reworked again and again until something new, a precise figure, character, emerges from this chaos. Always newness created from the nothingness. No character ever appears twice.\" Bicha Gallery, London, 2011. Indeed, Eric Bourdon's work is all about \"improv drawing\", as one can see on videos showing the artist drawing on a white board.Eric Bourdon on Vimeo. Samantha Deman, critic for the French information website about contemporary art Arts Hebdo | Medias Arts Hebdo | Medias succeeded, on the Internet, the French paper magazine Cimaise. was enthusiastic after seeing the results in painting: \"His universe is merry and fanciful, the stroke, spontaneous, has a great time on the canvas, virtuoso of the line, curves and arabesques, until the bright and luminous colours burst onto the scene and repossess it. Eric Bourdon bends kind monsters into shape who glide gracefully among a faun of individuals whose silhouettes are of the most amazing, plump or lanky, always infinitly sympathetic and delighted to come to stimulate our dormant child souls.\" Eric Bourdon - Cheerful Delirium, Arts Hebdo | Medias, by Samantha Deman, oct. 2009. ==Writing career== Bourdon wrote a book of philosophy in 2000Sils-Maria (Belgium) publishers. about artistic creation in practice. He wrote a long article for the magazine Concepts 1, comparing the first ethnological discoveries of L. Ron Hubbard, later the founder of the Church of Scientology, to Zarathustra by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Six years later he published a dark psychological thriller, Les Voleurs d'Enfant (The Child Thieves),'Editions de la M\u00e9duse' (Lille, France). depicting a cult against the cults. Although set in Boston, it is a dig at the French associations claiming religious neutrality and opposition to cults while behaving the same way as the cults they denounce.Official presentation page of the novel Les Voleurs d'Enfant. Les Clarificateurs (The Clearers),'Editions de la M\u00e9duse' (Lille, France). released on January 2012, is a more literary sequel to Les Voleurs d'Enfant, well received by critics.Literary criticism by Lydia Bonnaventure.Criticism by Thibault Isabel, writer and editor in chief of the French review Krisis. However, as the thriller seems to explore the family reasons that lead someone to enter into a very modern religious organisation, it might be seen this time again as a complete parody of these views and a critic of the failure of the modern society.Official presentation page of the novel Les Clarificateurs. ==Books== *Hors-sujets, ou l'art du n\u00e9ant et rebonds philosophiques (\"Beside the Point, or the Art of Nothingness and Philosophical Rebounds\"), Sils Maria asbl, February 2000. *Introduction to Nietzsche's \"Also Spratch Zarathustra\", in Concepts [1], Sils Maria asbl, August 2000, pp 91\u2013108. *Les Voleurs d'Enfant (The Child Thieves), La M\u00e9duse, Lille, August 2006. *Les Clarificateurs (The Clearers), La M\u00e9duse, Lille, January 2012. ==References== ==External links== * official website * official website Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Outsider artists Category:20th-century French painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:French male painters Category:21st-century French painters Category:21st-century male artists Category:21st-century French novelists Category:French male novelists Category:21st-century French male writers ",
