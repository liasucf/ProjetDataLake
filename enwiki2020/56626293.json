    "text": "Microtis arenaria, commonly known as the notched onion orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to south-eastern Australia. It has a single hollow, onion-like leaf and up to sixty scented, crowded yellowish-green flowers. It is widespread and common, growing in a wide variety of habitats. == Description == Microtis arenaria is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, tubular leaf long and wide. Between ten and sixty yellowish-green, fragrant flowers are crowded along a flowering stem tall. The flowers are long and wide. The dorsal sepal is egg- shaped, long and wide with its tip turned slightly upwards. The lateral sepals are long, about wide with their tips rolled under. The petals are lance-shaped but curved, about long, wide and are held under the dorsal sepal. The labellum curves downwards and is long, about wide with scalloped edges and a notch at the tip between two prominent lobes. There is an irregularly-shaped callus in the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from September to December. ==Taxonomy and naming== Microtis arenaria was first formally described in 1840 by John Lindley and the description was published in The Genera and Species of Orchidaceous Plants. The specific epithet (arenaria) is a Latin word meaning \"sandy\". ==Distribution and habitat== The notched onion orchid is widespread and common in south-eastern New South Wales, throughout Victoria, Tasmania and south-eastern South Australia. It grows in a range of habitats from sandhills to rocky inland outcrops but is most common in coastal sand. == References == == External links == * * arenaria Category:Prasophyllinae Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of New South Wales Category:Orchids of South Australia Category:Orchids of Tasmania Category:Orchids of Victoria (Australia) Category:Plants described in 1840 ",
