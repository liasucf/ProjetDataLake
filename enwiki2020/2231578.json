    "text": "Ebbsfleet International railway station is a railway station in Ebbsfleet Valley, in the Borough of Dartford, Kent, outside the eastern boundary of Greater London, England. It is near Dartford and the Bluewater shopping centre to the west and Gravesend to the east. The station is part of the Thames Gateway urban regeneration, a project of national priority. It stands on the High Speed 1 rail line, around south-west of Northfleet railway station and the Stonebridge Road area of Northfleet. The station lies off the A2 trunk road, about from its junction with the M25 motorway. During the London 2012 Olympics, it served as a primary park-and-rail service as it is very close to the M25 motorway, allowing easy access for over 10 million commuters. Ebbsfleet International is owned by HS1 Ltd, which acquired a 30-year concession to own and operate the High Speed 1 railway and the stations St Pancras railway station, Stratford International, Ebbsfleet International and Ashford International. ==Origin of the name== The name Ebbsfleet is an artificial creation of seventeenth-century antiquaries, partly inspired by the name of Ebbsfleet in Thanet, to the east.Keith Briggs, The two Ebbsfleets in Kent. Journal of the English Place-Name Society 44, 5\u20139 ==History== ===Opening=== The station opened to the public on 19 November 2007 for people travelling on Eurostar, later than St Pancras International because the security equipment was transferred from Waterloo International. The station was formally opened to Eurostar and dedicated in a ceremony by Dame Kelly Holmes on 29 January 2008. ===Naming=== \"Ebbsfleet International Station\" was the name originally proposed for the station, but \"Dartford International Station\" was later proposed at the urging of Eurostar, who felt that Dartford was a name with greater national recognition. Opposition to Eurostar's \u2018Dartford International\u2019 proposal came from Gravesham Borough Council, whose administrative centre at Gravesend is just two miles () away (even though Ebbsfleet International is in the borough of Dartford and therefore outside Gravesham council's authority); Southfleet Parish Council; and Swanscombe and Greenhithe Town Council, both in the Borough of Dartford. The similarity of its name to that of Dartford railway station, away, was also of concern. ===Javelin Shuttle=== The Olympic Javelin or Javelin was a high-speed train shuttle service operated by Southeastern over High Speed 1 during the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. The service ran for the duration of both games, between St Pancras International station and this station, via Stratford International station, which is close to the Olympic Park. During the Summer Olympics a service of eight trains an hour ran between St Pancras and Ebbsfleet, calling at Stratford, replacing the usual East Kent highspeed service. Two of these were extended to Ashford and one to Faversham. Between 11pm and 1am the service between St Pancras and Ebbsfleet was increased to twelve per hour. === Eurostar Service Suspension (2020-2022) === On Thursday 3 September 2020, it was announced by Eurostar that due to the ongoing 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, sales were down by 90% and thus both Ebbsfleet and Ashford International stations would not see any Eurostar services until at least 2022. ==Layout== On High Speed 1 there are avoiding lines in each direction and four platforms, two serving international Eurostar services and two the Southeastern High-speed services. Southeastern services travelling between London and the North Kent Line use a junction to the north of the station and are served by another pair of platforms that curve away to the east. Ticket barriers control access to all platforms. ==Access and facilities== This station has bilingual signage, both in French and English. It is one of the relatively few stations in England to have bilingual signage, others being Wallsend (Latin), Southall (Punjabi), Hereford (Welsh), St Pancras and Ashford International (French). ===Parking=== The Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) Act allows a total of 9,000 car parking spaces to be constructed,Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996 Section 9 4b with an initial 6,000 built. The car parks are in a number of areas around the station - north of the North Kent Line, between the North Kent Line and High Speed 1, south of the High Speed 1 and south west of the station building. ===Buses and coaches=== The station is served by Fastrack buses operated by Arriva Southern Counties, which connect it to Dartford, Bluewater, Greenhithe, Swanscombe and Gravesend. Despite being in close proximity to the station, Northfleet has no bus connection to the station. ===Taxis=== There is a taxi rank directly outside the station entrance/exit. Car rental services for both leisure and business are located in the concourse. The interchange facilities lie at either end of the main station box - taxis, buses and set down at the northern end (to also serve the NKL platforms) and coaches to the south of the station box. It was formerly planned that Crossrail would terminate at a separate station between Northfleet and Ebbsfleet International but under the current plan, Abbey Wood further west will be the eastern terminus. However, a Crossrail extension from Abbey Wood to Gravesend (Hoo Junction) remains safeguarded. ===Pedestrian access=== Northfleet railway station is approximately 400 metres to the north-east, although the walking distance between the two stations is significantly longer, approximately 2 km if roadside footpaths are followed. There is a shorter walking route (approximately 1,000 metres) through the car park to the north of Ebbsfleet station, but there are no footpaths provided and this way is obstructed by the car park access barriers. There are no specific pedestrian or cycle route signs for Ebbsfleet station on any of the possible routes between the stations. Gravesham Council acknowledges that the existing provision is inadequate,Gravesham Borough Council Report to Joint Transportation Board: Northfleet \u2013 Ebbsfleet station pedestrian links.,(see pages 65-69) although it is a complex planning issue to resolve as whilst Northfleet is in Gravesham, Ebbsfleet station is just over the border in the Borough of Dartford, and there are many other stakeholders involved. ==Services== International platform 1 As of the Summer 2014 timetable, there are up to five Eurostar services to Paris on weekdays, four on Saturdays and three on Sundays. Most of these services run non-stop from Ebbsfleet to Paris, though a few also stop at Ashford en route. There are four trains to Brussels on weekdays, three on Saturdays and two on Sundays. All Brussels services call at Lille and some also call at Calais. There is also a single round trip service on most days to Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e for the Disneyland Paris resort, which also calls at Ashford and Lille (in the France-bound direction only). It is not permitted to use Eurostar services for domestic journeys in the UK. Since the station's opening, Eurostar has withheld passenger usage statistics for international services, citing commercial confidentiality. Since the opening of Ebbsfleet station in 2007, Eurostar has transferred a number of trips from Ashford to the newer station. Ashford International has a wider variety of destinations such as Calais, Lille, Brussels, Disneyland Paris, the French Alps, Paris, Lyon, Avignon and Marseille, but with fewer services to them. In contrast, Ebbsfleet International has services to only the core destinations (Paris, Brussels and Lille) and the Disneyland Paris service, but with much more frequent services. On 29 June 2009 Southeastern started a weekday preview service between and Ebbsfleet International, extending to during peak hours. On 7 September the service was enhanced by a few services to Ramsgate via or Dover. A regular service began on 13 December 2009. The typical off-peak service was: * 4 trains per hour to St Pancras International, taking 17 minutes; * 2 trains per hour to Faversham; * 1 train per hour to Margate via Ashford International and Canterbury West; * 1 train per hour to Dover Priory via Ashford International, Folkestone West and Folkestone Central. Additional trains, in peak hours only, serve , via the Medway towns, and . Since 2 January 2015 the off peak service is: * 4 trains per hour to St Pancras International, taking 17 minutes; * 2 trains per hour to Faversham with 1 continuing to Ashford via Ramsgate and Dover; * 1 train per hour to Margate via Ashford International and Canterbury West; * 1 train per hour to Dover Priory via Ashford International, Folkestone Central continuing to Gravesend via Ramsgate and Faversham. The Eurostar services as of May 2019: * 6 trains per day to Paris Gare du Nord * 6 trains per day to Brussels-South, via Lille Europe (some via Ashford International additionally) * 1 train per day to Marne-la-Vallee - Chessy for Disneyland Paris via Ashford International and Lille Europe. ==Gallery== File:Ebbsfleet3709.JPG|Departures (Note: this had the old Eurostar logo) File:Ebbsfleet3716.JPG|The track towards the Medway Viaduct.
