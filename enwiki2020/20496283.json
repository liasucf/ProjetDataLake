    "text": "Get Karl! Oh Soo-jung () is a 2007 South Korean romantic comedy television series starring Uhm Jung-hwa and Oh Ji-ho. It aired on SBS from July 28 to September 16, 2007 on Saturdays and Sundays at 21:45 for 16 episodes. The series is based on the real-life love story of Lee Ju-young, the CEO of the drama's production company who reunited with her current husband ten years after breaking up with him. Moreover, Go Man-soo is the actual name of Lee's pro-golfer husband who incidentally instructed Oh Ji-ho on his golf swings in preparation for the role. ==Plot== Throughout her school days, Oh Soo-jung (Uhm Jung-hwa) was the girl every boy wanted to date and every girl wanted to be. But having watched her poor family disintegrate after her mother abandoned her incompetent father, Soo-jung naturally became cynical and demanding when it came to picking her choice of man. She dates Go Man-soo (Oh Ji-ho), an Ivy League law student, despite the lack of physical attraction (he is overweight and nerdy). But the moment she finds out that he failed his bar exam, poor Man-soo gets dumped. But eight years later, the tables are turned. Soo-jung, now in her thirties, is no longer in demand. The former \"it girl\" has since fallen from grace. She manages the jewelry store owned by a less attractive schoolmate who married a lawyer and now barks at Soo-jung every chance she gets. Man-soo returns from the States a changed man; he has transformed into famous, rich, hunky pro-golfer Karl Go. He hires Jung Woo-tak (Kang Sung-jin) to play a wealthy bachelor, and once Soo-jungs fall in love with him, he's to jilt her at the altar, just like she did to Man-soo. Meanwhile, Karl pretends to be the debt-ridden boyfriend of Soo-jung's boarder Yook Dae-soon (Park Da- an). But his revenge plans go awry when he and Soo-jung fall in love with each other again. On her wedding day to Woo-tak, Soo-jung runs away and chooses Karl despite believing he's poor. Bitter that Karl chose a girdle-clad \"old maid\" over her, Dae-soon not only steals her creative ideas for jewelry design but reveals to Soo-jung that Karl has been making a fool of her all this time. In the end, Soo-jung triumphs over Dae-soon professionally, then proposes to Karl and they finally get married. ==Cast== ===Main characters=== * Oh Ji-ho as Go Man-soo / Karl Go * Uhm Jung-hwa as Oh Soo-jung * Kang Sung-jin as Jung Woo-tak * Park Da-an as Yook Dae-soon ===Supporting characters=== * Ahn Sun- young as Lee Young-ae, Soo-jung's friend * Yoo Hye-jung as Kim Pil-sook, Soo- jung's friend * Sung Dong-il as Jung Seung-gyu, Karl's manager/friend * Ahn Yong-joon as Choi Soo-hyuk, Soo-jung's younger brother * Kim Kap-soo as Oh Byung-jik, Soo-jung's father * Yu Ji-in as Shim Wol-do, Soo-jung's mother * Kim Dong-kyun as Yoon Dong-kwan, Young-ae's husband * Jeong Min-jin as Daniel * Seo Hee-seung as Man-soo's father * Han Bok-hee as Man-soo's mother ==Episode ratings== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"66ccff\" width=\"25%\" align=center| Date ! bgcolor=\"66ccff\" width=\"25%\" align=center| Episode ! bgcolor=\"66ccff\" width=\"25%\" align=center| Nationwide ! bgcolor=\"66ccff\" width=\"25%\" align=center| Seoul |- | align=center|July 28, 2007 | align=center|1 | align=center|12.4 (9th) | align=center|12.9 (9th) |- | align=center|July 29, 2007 | align=center|2 | align=center|14.8 (6th) | align=center|16.2 (5th) |- | align=center|August 4, 2007 | align=center|3 | align=center|12.1 (8th) | align=center|12.6 (9th) |- | align=center|August 5, 2007 | align=center|4 | align=center|15.5 (5th) | align=center|16.3 (4th) |- | align=center|August 11, 2007 | align=center|5 | align=center|12.8 (7th) | align=center|13.8 (7th) |- | align=center|August 12, 2007 | align=center|6 | align=center|14.3 (10th) | align=center|15.1 (9th) |- | align=center|August 18, 2007 | align=center|7 | align=center|11.8 (9th) | align=center|12.4 (7th) |- | align=center|August 19, 2007 | align=center|8 | align=center|14.5 (6th) | align=center|15.4 (5th) |- | align=center|August 25, 2007 | align=center|9 | align=center|13.5 (7th) | align=center|14.4 (6th) |- | align=center|August 26, 2007 | align=center|10 | align=center|13.9 (8th) | align=center|14.9 (6th) |- | align=center|September 1, 2007 | align=center|11 | align=center|15.5 (5th) | align=center|16.4 (5th) |- | align=center|September 2, 2007 | align=center|12 | align=center|14.1 (6th) | align=center|15.1 (5th) |- | align=center|September 8, 2007 | align=center|13 | align=center|13.2 (6th) | align=center|13.8 (5th) |- | align=center|September 9, 2007 | align=center|14 | align=center|11.6 (8th) | align=center|12.1 (8th) |- | align=center|September 15, 2007 | align=center|15 | align=center|14.2 (6th) | align=center|14.8 (5th) |- | align=center|September 16, 2007 | align=center|16 | align=center|14.7 (9th) | align=center|15.8 (7th) |- ! colspan='2' align=center|Average | align=center|13.7% | align=center|14.5% |} ==Soundtrack== #\uc131\uacf5\uc2dc\ub300 - Sun #Man To Man (Inst.) #I Love Diamond (Inst.) #Love Line (Inst.) #Sentimental (Inst.) #Grey Shoes (Inst.) #Gloomy Day (Inst.) #Choice Of Love (Inst.) #Warning!
