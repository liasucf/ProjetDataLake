    "text": "Karl Witte. Johann Heinrich Friedrich Karl Witte (July 1, 1800, Lochau (now part of Schkopau) \u2013 March 6, 1883, Halle) was a German jurist and scholar of Dante Alighieri. ==Biography== Witte was the son of pastor Karl Heinrich Gottfried Witte (1767-1845) who encouraged a fairly intense program of learning. When Karl Witte was nine, he spoke German, French, Italian, Latin, and Greek, and on April 10, 1814, at the age of 13, he became a doctor of philosophy at the University of Giessen in Germany. As a result, Witte was listed in The Guinness Book of World Records as the \"youngest doctorate\", a record that still stands; however, The Guinness Book of World Records lists his age as 12. Witte was the subject of a book written by his father: The Education of Karl Witte: Or, The Training of the Child. This book attracted criticism and soon fell into oblivion in Germany. He achieved his reputation as a Dante scholar in 1823 with his essay \"The Art of Misunderstanding Dante\". == References == ==External links== * * * \"The Art of Misunderstanding Dante\" in Category:1800 births Category:1883 deaths Category:Leipzig University alumni ",
