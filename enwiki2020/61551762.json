    "text": "John Lee Hooker on Campus is an album by blues musician John Lee Hooker released by the Vee-Jay label in 1963. ==Reception== AllMusic reviewer Al Campbell stated: \"John Lee Hooker on Campus is titled to sound like a live recording but it isn't... these 12 tracks originally tried to capitalize on Hooker's emergence on the coffeehouse/college tours he was involved in at the time. This is an electric album that contains excellent material from Hooker, even though the occasional background singers get in the way, attempting to modernize his gritty blues with a smoother soul sound\". ==Track listing== All compositions credited to John Lee Hooker # \"I'm Leaving\" \u2013 2:11 # \"Love Is a Burning Thing\" \u2013 2:37 # \"Birmingham Blues\" \u2013 2:52 # \"I Want to Shout\" \u2013 2:23 # \"Don't Look Back\" \u2013 2:54 # \"I Want to Hug You\" \u2013 2:39 # \"Poor Me\" \u2013 3:10 # \"I Want to Ramble\" \u2013 2:27 # \"Half a Stranger\" \u2013 4:22 # \"My Grinding Mill\" \u2013 3:09 # \"Bottle Up and Go\" \u2013 2:24 # \"One Way Ticket\" \u2013 3:27 ==Personnel== *John Lee Hooker \u2013 guitar, vocals *Unidentified musicians \u2013 drums, piano, vocals ==References== Category:John Lee Hooker albums Category:1963 albums Category:Vee-Jay Records albums ",
