Corbett (born 23 December 1947http://www.ae- info.org/ae/Member/Corbett_Greville/CV) is Distinguished Professor of Linguistics at the University of Surrey and founder member of the Surrey Morphology Group. == Biography == He was educated at the University of Birmingham where he was awarded a BA, MA and PhD. He joined the University of Surrey in 1974. He has been a Fellow of the British Academy since 1997 and is an Academician of the Academy of Social Sciences, a Member of the Academia Europaea and an Honorary Member of the Linguistic Society of America. As an author, he is widely held in libraries worldwide. In 2017, he signed the Declaration on the Common Language of the Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks and Montenegrins.Signatories of the Declaration on the Common Language, official website, retrieved on 2018-08-16. == Research == He has three broad areas of interest: 1) Typology. He works on the typology of features, as in Gender (1991), Number (2000), Agreement (2006) and Features (2012), all with Cambridge University Press. Recently, with several colleagues, he has been developing the canonical approach to typology. Within that approach he has papers in Language, on suppletion (2007) and on lexical splits (2015). For some years he has been developing the Canonical Typology framework, which has expanded beyond its original heartland of morphology and syntax to include work in phonology and sign language. 2) Morphosyntactic features. Number, gender, person and case all offer interesting challenges. 3) Inflectional Morphology (especially Network Morphology) the European Research Council funded project Morphological Complexity which examined the ways in which morphological structure introduces complexity which has no apparent function outside this component. Corbett's resulting research on the typology of splits in paradigms has appeared in Language. His most recent work is on conditions on inflection, the generalizations which cross-cut the generalizations provided by inflection classes, and concerned with the practical issue of how inflectional material is represented in a transparent and comprehensible way. == Published works == * * * * * * * * * * == References == == External links == * * Bibliography of works by Greville G.
