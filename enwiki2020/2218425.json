    "text": "A fyrk was a monetary unit used in Sweden in the 15th to 17th century, with a value of between 1/6 and 1/2 \u00f6re. The word is derived from Middle Low German vereken (vierichen) and ultimately from ver or vier, a monetary unit (from vier, \"four\"). After the monetary unit had been abolished, the word remained in use in the general sense of \"small money\", \"pennies\", \"an insignificant sum\"; and as a slang word for \"money\" in Finnish Swedish as well as in Finnish as a dialectal loan word (). With the Swedish municipal reforms of 1862, the unit fyrk was re-used as a unit for counting voting rights in the municipal election. Voting rights were graded according to income and assets, counted in fyrks and recorded in the , the \"fyrk counting list\" for each municipality. It was in use from 1863-1909. The or \"road fyrk\", a unit for road tax, remained in use until 1937. Up until 17th century fyrks were minted from silver; later the copper was used as the value of the coin suffered continuous inflation. ==References== *\"Fyrk\" in Svenska Akademiens Ordbok *\"Fyrk\" in Nordisk familjebok, vol 9 (1908) *Nationalencyklopedin, s.v. \"Fyrk\" Category:Economic history of Sweden Category:Modern obsolete currencies ",
