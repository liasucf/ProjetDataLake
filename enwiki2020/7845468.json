    "text": "A bottle from the 2005 vintage Ch\u00e2teau Durfort-Vivens is a winery in the Margaux appellation of the Bordeaux region of France. It is also the name of the red wine produced by this property. The wine produced here was classified as one of fifteen Deuxi\u00e8mes Crus (Second Growths) in the original Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855. While the 1855 classification is still legally in effect, more modern classifications have been performed to reconcile changes over time. In The Liv-ex Bordeaux Classification, in which quality of Bordeaux red wine is determined by demand in terms of price, Ch\u00e2teau Durfort-Vivens is listed as a Fifth Growth. In Alexis Lichine's classification of Bordeaux wine, which is based on subjective criteria, it is a Grand Cru (Great Growth), putting it in the third group on his list. ==History== The Durfort property dates back to the 12th century having been owned by the influential Durfort de Duras family for seven centuries. The family also owned the nearby Ch\u00e2teau Lamothe, later renamed Ch\u00e2teau Margaux. The property was purchased in 1824 by M. de Vivens, and renamed Ch\u00e2teau Durfort Vivens. In the 20th century, the ch\u00e2teau was purchased by local n\u00e9gociants, and in 1961 it was purchased by Ch\u00e2teau Margaux, which was controlled by the Lurton family, which also owns Ch\u00e2teau Brane-Cantenac and Ch\u00e2teau Climens. Until that time, the wine was produced at Ch\u00e2teau Margaux. Lucien's son Gonzague Lurton, became the head of operations 1992. ==Vineyards and wine == The Chateau has planted with Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc.
