    "text": "An incidence structure C=(P,L,I) consists of points P, lines L, and flags I \\subseteq P \\times L where a point p is said to be incident with a line l if (p,l) \\in I. It is a (finite) partial geometry if there are integers s,t,\\alpha\\geq 1 such that: * For any pair of distinct points p and q, there is at most one line incident with both of them. * Each line is incident with s+1 points. * Each point is incident with t+1 lines. * If a point p and a line l are not incident, there are exactly \\alpha pairs (q,m)\\in I, such that p is incident with m and q is incident with l. A partial geometry with these parameters is denoted by pg(s,t,\\alpha). ==Properties== * The number of points is given by \\frac{(s+1)(s t+\\alpha)}{\\alpha} and the number of lines by \\frac{(t+1)(s t+\\alpha)}{\\alpha}. * The point graph (also known as the collinearity graph) of a pg(s,t,\\alpha) is a strongly regular graph: srg((s+1)\\frac{(s t+\\alpha)}{\\alpha},s(t+1),s-1+t(\\alpha-1),\\alpha(t+1)). * Partial geometries are dual structures: the dual of a pg(s,t,\\alpha) is simply a pg(t,s,\\alpha). ==Special case== * The generalized quadrangles are exactly those partial geometries pg(s,t,\\alpha) with \\alpha=1. * The Steiner systems are precisely those partial geometries pg(s,t,\\alpha) with \\alpha=s+1. ==Generalisations== A partial linear space S=(P,L,I) of order s, t is called a semipartial geometry if there are integers \\alpha\\geq 1, \\mu such that: * If a point p and a line \\ell are not incident, there are either 0 or exactly \\alpha pairs (q,m)\\in I, such that p is incident with m and q is incident with \\ell. * Every pair of non-collinear points have exactly \\mu common neighbours. A semipartial geometry is a partial geometry if and only if \\mu = \\alpha(t+1). It can be easily shown that the collinearity graph of such a geometry is strongly regular with parameters (1 + s(t + 1) + s(t+1)t(s - \\alpha + 1)/\\mu, s(t+1), s - 1 + t(\\alpha - 1), \\mu). A nice example of such a geometry is obtained by taking the affine points of PG(3, q^2) and only those lines that intersect the plane at infinity in a point of a fixed Baer subplane; it has parameters (s, t, \\alpha, \\mu) = (q^2 - 1, q^2 + q, q, q(q + 1)). ==See also== * Maximal arc ==References== * * * * * Category:Incidence geometry ",
