Upon release Love Boutique received rave reviews. Edge New York praised Nozari as \"a clever lyricist and able to craft tunes that are memorable after just one listen\" and called the album \"a treasure trove of torso-twisting tunes.\" Towleroad.com singled out Nozari's DJ experience as informing the album's most original moments, \"Look to (song) 'Acceptable 2 U' for a compelling rock/dance hybrid that stands to be the authentic counterpart to (Lady Gaga's) 'Born This Way'.\". Rating it one of the Top 10 Entertainment Highlights of the Week on April 8, 2011, The Advocate called the album \"stylishly playful\" and gave especially high praise to album track \"House of Mirrors\" saying \"it may be the fiercest antibullying anthem ever.\" And TheShowT.com credited the album for its \"standout booty-bouncing tracks.\" == Track listing == The track listing was confirmed by Nozari's official website.
