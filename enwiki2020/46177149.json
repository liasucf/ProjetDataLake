There is a brown straight line across both wings, from the apex of the forewings to the abdominal margin of the hindwings one-third from the base, indistinctly marked with white on the forewings on the outer side and with a blackish spot with some white scales in it on the hindmargin of the forewings near the angle, the space outside the transverse line rather darker than the rest of the wings and on the hindwings there is a whitish space on the basal of the costa.Catalogue of Eastern and Australian Lepidoptera Heterocera in the Collection of the Oxford University Museum (1): 243 ==Subspecies== *Oreta singapura singapura (Singapore, Malaysia, Sumatra, Borneo) *Oreta singapura continua (Warren, 1899) (Seram, New Guinea) *Oreta singapura kalisi Watson, 1961 (Sulawesi) ==References== Category:Moths described in 1892 Category:Drepaninae ",
