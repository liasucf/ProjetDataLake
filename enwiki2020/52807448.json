The film features Gemini Ganesan and Savithri in the lead roles. ==Plot== Manickam is wanted by the army of East India Company. He is absconding and takes refuge in the house of Maheswari. Manickam and Maheswari fall in love with each other. Manickam's father Dharmalingam demands a large dowry from Maheswari's mother, Kanthimathi, who somehow manages to give the amount. However, Dharmalingam comes to know that Kanthimathi is ridiculed by the villagers as a woman of loose moral character. So, he sends back Maheswari to her home. Manickam is helpless because he depends on his father for everything. Kanthimathi commits suicide. Maheswari starts looking for a means to earn a living and she comes across Mayathevan, the leader of a gang of robbers who is wanted by the East India Company. She is employed by him as chief assistant. Mayathevan renames Maheswari as Rani Rangamma. Though she lives comfortably like a queen, her heart yearns for Manickam.
