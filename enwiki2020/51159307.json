    "text": "Bodies is the debut extended play (EP) by Australian singer songwriter Celia Pavey. It was announced on 4 August 2014, along with a tour of Australia's east coast. The EP was released on 29 August 2014. In an interview leading up to the EPs release, Pavey said; \u201cI\u2019m a very honest person so I like to write about real things that are happening in my life rather than make up stories. I write a lot about the people in my life. Most of my songs are about love or the habits people share.\u201d The EP was on-track to chart within the Australian ARIA top 40 but did not feature on the chart that following week. ==Review== Riley Ackley, the Promotional Direct from The Oswegonian gave the EP 4.5 out of 5 saying the EP \"is a beautiful four track debut. Focusing heavily on acoustics and Pavey\u2019s angel-like melodies, each song off of \u201cBodies\u201d will carry listeners into a day dream trance.\" adding, \"Overall, Bodies is near perfection. As an EP, its glossy set-up paired with Pavey\u2019s celestial voice makes it one of the most prominent EP releases of the year. Celia Pavey\u2019s Bodies is proof that there is more to be done in the folk-singer-songwriter genre. Other artists beware, because they\u2019ll soon pale in comparison.\" Lizotte's said \"This studio introduction to Celia's honest and adventurous folk songwriting sweeps through that flat, ghostly landscape and into sonically lush territory\" adding \"Celia sings of young loss and desire with a voice that has already captured international attention.\" In a review of the EP and the live tour, Chloe Webb of Reverb Street Press said \"Pavey has truly found her place musically, a meticulous combination of rambling folk and easy listening indie-pop.\" ==Track listing== # \"Bodies\" (Danielle Blakey / Alexandra Hosking / Celia Pavey / Jake Stone) \u2013 3:20 # \"Shadow\" (Tim Hart / Hugo Levingston / Celia Pavey) \u2013 3:42 # \"Red\" (Celia Pavey) \u2013 4:38 # \"Laura\" (Natasha Khan / Justin Parker) \u2013 4:02 ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Region !scope=\"col\"|Date !scope=\"col\"|Format(s) !scope=\"col\"|Label |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia |29 August 2014 |Digital download |Universal Music Australia |- |} ==References== Category:2014 debut EPs Category:EPs by Australian artists Category:Universal Music Australia EPs Category:Vera Blue albums ",
