    "text": "KQMB (96.7 FM) is a lower-powered version of the radio station broadcasting a hot adult contemporary music format and 1980s' music format. Licensed to Levan, Utah, United States, the station serves much of central Utah. The station is now owned by a Utah corporation in Utah County called JJIE Corporation. KQMB has an AM sister station known as KSRR, KStar 1400 AM. ==Rebroadcaster== KQMB has a booster station, KQMB-FM1 in Provo, but it has been cancelled in 2020. ==History== The station was assigned the call letters KBLN on January 8, 1999. On January 25, 2001, the station changed its call sign to KCFM and on September 21, 2005, to the current KQMB. KQMB picked up the call sign and format from 102.7, which is now known as KSL (radio network) KSL-FM. However, it does not penetrate nearly as far into the Wasatch Front as 102.7. It completely misses Salt Lake City itself, and provides only marginal coverage of the Salt Lake City suburbs. In 2014, the station lost its signal, in 2017, the station went dark, and in 2018, the station will remain silent for a while. On December 20, 2018, Zeta Holdings, LLC sold the silent fm radio station KQMB-Levan, KQMB-FM1 Provo, KQMB Star 96.7, and translator K244DH-Fort Douglas for $100,000 to a Utah corporation in Utah County called JJIE Corporation owned by Franklyn H. & Melanie Mueller. The sale was consummated on May 21, 2019. But in 2020, the KQMB-FM1 booster in Provo, Utah has been cancelled. ==References== ==External links== * QMB Category:Radio stations established in 2002 Category:Adult contemporary radio stations in the United States Category:2002 establishments in Utah ",
