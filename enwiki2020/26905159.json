Business listings are printed on yellow paper as opposed to white paper for non-commercial and private phone numbers. Golden Pages is published in Belgium, Czech Republic, Republic of Ireland, Israel, Netherlands, Uzbekistan, Bulgaria and Romania. The publishing companies in these countries are not necessarily related. ==Israel== Golden Pages Israel (, Dapei Zahav) was founded by Morris Kahn in 1968, distributing three directories in Tel Aviv, Haifa and Jerusalem. Originally a subsidiary of the international Yellow Pages company, it was divested due to the Arab League boycott of Israel \u2013 because of the company's desire to enter the Saudi Arabian market. It was quietly sold to Kahn who developed it into a large multinational telecom- related business, from which he spun off Amdocs in 1982. In 2007, the company was sold by Markstone Capital Partners to Australian firm Babcock & Brown, who purchased 100% of the company. The company's CEO is Nir Lampert. The largest competitor is Bezeq, which launched a rival internet service in July 2008. The directory lists 250,000 businesses. The slogan of the company \"\u05ea\u05df \u05dc\u05d0\u05e6\u05d1\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea \u05dc\u05dc\u05db\u05ea \u05d1\u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05de\u05da\" (Ten LeEtzba'ot Lelekhet BeMkomkha), parallel to the English \"let your fingers do the walking\" has become an idiom in Hebrew, and means to do the work with your phone or computer instead of running around. ==See also== * Yellow pages *Aurec Group ==References== ==External links== * Golden Pages Israel * Golden Pages Ireland * Golden Pages France * Golden Pages Belgium * Golden Pages Uzbekistan * Golden Pages Romania Category:Yellow pages Category:1968 establishments in Israel ",
