(Crotalus horridus, pp. 956\u2013966.) is a species of venomous pit viper endemic to eastern North America. This is the only rattlesnake species in most of the populous northeastern United States and is second only to its cousins to the west, the prairie rattlesnake, as the most northerly distributed venomous snake in North America.Conant R (1975).

No subspecies are currently recognized. ==Taxonomy== The timber rattlesnake was one of the many reptile species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, and still bears its original name Crotalus horridus. The subspecies C. h. atricaudatus (Latreille in Sonnini and Latreille, 1802), often referred to as the canebrake rattlesnake, is currently considered invalid. Previously, it was recognized by Gloyd (1936) and Klauber (1936). Based on an analysis of geographic variation, Pisani et al. (1972) concluded no subspecies should be recognized. This was rejected by Conant (1975), but followed by Collins and Knight (1980). Brown and Ernst (1986) found evidence for retaining the two subspecies, but state it is not possible to tell them apart without having more information than usual, including adult size, color pattern, the number of dorsal scale rows and the number of ventral scales. Dundee and Rossman (1989) recognized C. h. atricaudatus, but others take a more neutral point of view. ==Description== Adults usually grow to total length of . It was found in Pennsylvania that the smallest size females that could produce viable eggs was .Galligan JH, Dunson WA (1979). \"Biology and status of timber rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus) populations in Pennsylvania\".

The dorsal scales are keeled (Crotalus horridus, pp. 688-689 + Plates 619, 620, 653.) and arranged in 21\u201326 scale rows at midbody (usually 25 rows in the southern part of its geographic range, and 23 rows in the northern part). The ventral scales number 158\u2013177 in males and 163\u2013183 in females. Males have 20\u201330 subcaudal scales, while females have 15\u201326. The rostral scale is normally a little higher than it is wide. In the internasal-prefrontal area there are 4\u201322 scales that include 2 large, triangular internasal scales that border the rostral, followed by 2 large, quadrangular prefrontal scales (anterior canthals) that may contact each other along the midline, or may be separated by many small scales. Between the supraocular and internasal, only a single canthal scale is present. There are 5\u20137 intersupraocular scales. The number of prefoveal scales varies between 2 and 8. Usually the first supralabial scale is in broad contact with the prenasal scale, although slightly to moderately separated along its posteroventral margin by the most anterior prefoveals. Dorsally, they have a pattern of dark brown or black crossbands on a yellowish brown or grayish background. The crossbands have irregular zig-zag edges, and may be V-shaped or M-shaped. Often a rust-colored vertebral stripe is present. Ventrally they are yellowish, uniform or marked with black.Boulenger GA (1896).

Putnam's Sons. 365 pp. (Crotalus horridus horridus, pp. 301-302 + Plate 33; Crotalus horridus atricaudatus, p. 302). ==Distribution and habitat== Timber rattlesnakes are present in the eastern United States from southern Minnesota and southern New Hampshire, south to east Texas and north Florida.Conant R, Collins JT (1998). Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern/Central North America. New York: Houghton Mifflin. One hundred and fifteen rattlesnakes have been marked within Brown County State Park in Indiana, one of the only places where they can be found in the state. Its historic range includes southern Ontario and southern Quebec in Canada, but in May 2001, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed it as extirpated in Canada.Crotalus horridus at Species at Risk Public Registry. Accessed 23 June 2008. A Canadian government sponsored recovery strategy is currently under study to support the reintroducing of this predator of many pests to its former Canadian habitat. Although several experts disagree, many were present in some of the thick forest areas of central and southeastern Iowa, mostly within the Mississippi, Skunk, Iowa, and Des Moines River valleys, in several places in these areas; bites from timber rattlesnakes have been widespread, especially in a localized area of Geode State Park, in southeastern Henry County, along Credit Island Park, in southern Scott County, and in the forested areas of southern Clinton County. The museum at Amana Colony, Iowa asserts that one founding family lost their firstborn, a daughter at the age of three, due to a rattlesnake bite she received while playing on a woodpile in the 19th century. In Pennsylvania, it is not present west of Chestnut Ridge, which is in the Laurel Highlands, nor is it present in the southeastern corner of the state. Thus, its range does not include the areas of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, the two largest cities in Pennsylvania. C. horridus is extirpated in Maine and Rhode Island and is almost extirpated in New Hampshire. In Massachusetts, the snakes are active from mid-May to mid-October. Early settlers were afraid of the snake, as its population was widespread throughout the state. Since that time their habitat has been reduced to the Blue Hills south of Boston, The Berkshires in Western Massachusetts as well as parts of the Connecticut River Valley, notably in the area of the Holyoke Range. The snake is so rare in the state that it is rarely encountered by people and is considered endangered, making it illegal to harass, kill, collect, or possess. Generally, this species is found in deciduous forests in rugged terrain. During the summer, gravid (pregnant) females seem to prefer open, rocky ledges where the temperatures are higher, while males and nongravid females tend to spend more time in cooler, denser woodland with more closed forest canopy.Timber Rattlesnake Fact Sheet at NY State Dept. of Environmental Conservation. Accessed 8 February 2007. ==Behavior== Female timber rattlers often bask in the sun before giving birth, in open rocky areas known as \"basking knolls\". During the winter, timber rattlesnakes brumate in dens, in limestone crevices, often together with copperheads and black rat snakes. ===Feeding=== Their prey are mainly small mammals, but may include small birds, frogs, other small animals, including other snakes. Although capable of consuming other rattlesnakes, the most common snake they prey upon are garter snakes. Like most rattlesnakes, timber rattlesnakes are known to utilize chemical cues to find sites to ambush their prey and will often strike their prey and track them until they can be consumed.Clark RW (2004). \"Timber rattlesnakes (Crotalus horridus) use chemical cues to select ambush sites\". Journal of Chemical Ecology 30 (3): 607-617.Reinert HK, Cundall D, Bushar LM (1984). \"Foraging behavior of the timber rattlesnake, Crotalus horridus \". Copeia 1984: 976-981. Timber rattlesnakes are known to use fallen logs as a waiting site for prey to pass by, giving them an elevated perch from which to effectively strike their prey, which is almost entirely terrestrial rather than arboreal (even arboreal prey such as squirrels tends to be caught when they come to the ground).Platt SG, Hawkes AW, Rainwater TR (2001). \"Diet of the canebrake rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus atricaudatus): An additional record and review\". Texas Journal of Science 53 (2): 115-120. The primary foods by genera of timber rattlesnakes were as follows: Peromyscus (33.3%), Microtus (10.9%), Tamias (qv) (10.6%), Sylvilagus (10.4%), Sigmodon (5.3%) and Sciurus (4.2%). Based on examination of the snout-to-vent length, it was found that juvenile timber rattlesnakes differed slightly in dietary preferences from adult rattlesnakes, being more likely to consume smaller prey such as shrews (averaging and unable to attack subadult eastern cottontail rabbits (averaging but Peromyscus was the number one prey item for both young and adult rattlesnakes. Several birds, although always secondary to mammals, are also known to be hunted, mainly ground- dwelling species such as bobwhites, but also a surprising number of passerines.Clark RW (2002). '\"Diet of the timber rattlesnake, Crotalus horridus \". Journal of Herpetology 36 (3): 494-499. ===Venom=== Potentially, this is one of North America's most dangerous snakes, due to its long fangs, impressive size, and high venom yield. This is to some degree offset by its relatively mild dispositionNorris R (2004). \"Venom Poisoning in North American Reptiles\". In Campbell JA, Lamar WW (2004). The Venomous Reptiles of the Western Hemisphere. Ithaca and London: Comstock Publishing Associates. 870 pp., 1,500 plates. . and long brumation period. Before striking, they often perform a good deal of preliminary rattling and feinting.US Navy (1991). Poisonous Snakes of the World. New York: US Government / Dover Publications Inc. 203 pp. . Cist (1845) described how he lived in western Pennsylvania for many years, and the species was quite common there, but in all that time, he heard of only a single death resulting from its bite. Considerable geographic and ontogenetic variation occurs regarding the toxicity of the venom, which can be said for many rattlesnake species. Four venom patterns have been described for this species: Type A is largely neurotoxic, and is found in various parts of the southern range. One effect of the toxin can be generalized myokymia. Type B is hemorrhagic and proteolytic, and is found consistently in the north and in parts of the southeast. Type A + B is found in areas where the aforementioned types apparently intergrade in southwestern Arkansas and northern Louisiana. Type C venom has none of the above components and is relatively weak. The neurotoxic component of the type A venom is referred to as canebrake toxin, and is a phospholipase A2. It is analogous to the neurotoxins found in the venoms of several other rattlesnake species, and when present, contributes significantly to the overall toxicity. Other components found in the venom include a small basic peptide that works as a myotoxin, a fibrinogen-clotting enzyme that can produce defibrination syndrome, and a bradykinin-releasing enzyme. CroFab antivenom, while not specific for C. horridus, is used to treat envenomations from this species. ==Symbol== The timber rattlesnake was designated the state reptile of West Virginia in 2008. That state's legislature praised \"...a proud contribution by the eighth grade class at Romney Middle School, from West Virginia's oldest county, in West Virginia's oldest town, to have been instrumental in making the timber rattlesnake the state reptile...\" This snake became a prominent symbol of American anger and resolve during the American Revolution due to its fearsome reputation. In the 18th century, European-trained doctors and scientists had little firsthand experience with or information on timber rattlesnakes,Bryson, Bill (2004). A Short History of Nearly Everything. New York: Broadway Books. p. 81. and treatment of their bites was poorly effective. The motto Nemo me impune lacesset (with the verb in the future tense) appears above a Crotalus horridus on a 1778 $20 bill from Georgia as an early example of the colonial use of the coiled rattlesnake symbol, which later became famous on the Gadsden flag. ==Conservation status== This species is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List (assessed in 2007). Species are listed as such due to their wide distribution, presumed large population, or because they are unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. The timber rattlesnake is listed as endangered in New Jersey, Vermont, Massachusetts (along with the copperhead viper), Virginia, New Hampshire, Indiana, and Ohio, and it is threatened in New York, Connecticut, Illinois, Minnesota, and Texas. Timber rattlesnakes have already been extirpated in Maine and Rhode Island and only one population remains in New Hampshire. They are protected in many of the Appalachian states but their populations continue to decline. ==See also== * Snakebite * Gadsden flag ==References== ==Further reading== *Brown CW, Ernst CH (1986). \"A Study of Variation in Eastern Timber Rattlesnakes, Crotalus horridus Linnae (Serpentes, Viperidae)\".
