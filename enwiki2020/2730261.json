It is located to the east of the Western Express Highway, which is part of the National Highway 8. == Urban development == As a part of rapid urban development in this locality, a significant number of residential complexes were constructed here since the early 1990s. The area is broadly divided into two distinct categories of housing complexes: the high-rises and the low-rises. The high-rises (20+ floors) include Viceroy Savana, TW Gardens, Evershine Crown, Gundecha Premiere, Gundecha Greens, Thakur Jewel, Gokul Gagan, Vishnu Shivam Tower, Gokul Concorde, Challengers, Oberoi Gardens, Oberoi Park View, Viceroy Park, Evershine Millenium Paradise Halley 47-49, and Raheja Reflections Phase 2, Sarova Alpine. There are also various new buildings in construction correctly, as of September 2020. The low-rises include Vasant Sagar and Vasant Utsav which are very famous for dozens of shops under it where people come to hangout, as these places have numerous eateries too. They also include Evershine Millennium Paradise except for Halley 47-49, Gundecha Valley of Flowers, Viceroy Court, Raheja Reflections Phase 1, NG Suncity, and Bhoomi Valley.
