Doufunao can be found at breakfast stands along the streets in the morning. Other times it is hard to find outside of a restaurant. === Sichuan cuisine === Douhua in Sichuan is often made without any sugar at all, then served by carrying pole or bicycle vendors with a number of condiments such as chili oil, soy sauce, Sichuan pepper, scallions, and nuts, and is sometimes eaten along with white rice as well. === Hubei cuisine === Douhua is served with sugar in Hubei.
