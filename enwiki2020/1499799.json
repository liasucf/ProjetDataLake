The editorials usually offer praise for the Songun policy, the government and leadership, and encourage the growth of the nation.

On January 1, 2006, the agency sent out a joint- editorial from North Korea's state newspapers calling for the withdrawal of American forces from South Korea. While annual January 1 editorials are a tradition among the papers, that year's brought attention from Western media outlets, by calling for a \"nationwide campaign for driving out the U.S. troops\".\"North Korea Demands U.S. Troop Withdrawal\" . .Fox News. December 31, 2005. The editorial made several references to Korean reunification. The 2009 editorial received similar attention, as criticism of United States policy was absent, and the admission of severe economic problems in North Korea. The editorial also made reference to denuclearisation on the Korean Peninsula, in what analysts claimed was a \"hopeful\" sign.2009 Joint New Year Editorial Issued, KCNA, January 1, 2009.North Korea message is mild on US. BBC News. January 1, 2009. This was echoed again in its 2010 editorial, which called for an end to hostilities with the United States and a nuclear free Korean Peninsula.Kim, Sam (January 1, 2010). N. Korea calls for end to enmity with U.S., hints at return to nuclear talks. Yonhap. The 2011 joint editorial edition, aside from its calls for a denuclearized Korea and for a slowdown of tensions between the two Koreas, has for the first time, mentioned the rising light industries of North Korea, given as a reason for an upcoming upsurge in the national economy in the new year and for the achievement of the Kangsong Taeguk national mission. The 2012 joint editorial edition, the first under Kim Jong-un's leadership, started with a great tribute to Kim Jong-il and aside from recurring calls for improving inter-Korean relations and for the fulfillment of the October 4 Declaration of 2007, also called on the whole nation to give priority to do Kim Jong-il's 2012 mission of Strong and Prosperous Nation, continue his and his father Kim Il-sung's legacies to the entire country and the socialist cause, and to build up and encourage the various sectors that compose the nation to become contributors to national progress in all areas at all costs. This practice ended in 2013 when Kim Jong- un delivered the first New Year speech on television in 19 years. In June 2018, Rodong Sinmun devoted a four-page feature to the North Korea\u2013United States summit, welcoming its results. The article carried the text of the declaration in full. In addition, it mentioned security guarantees and Donald Trump's pledge to cease the joint military exercises with South Korea. It failed to mention the promise Kim had allegedly made to Trump about closing down a test site for missile engines, however. ==See also== *Kulloja *List of newspapers in North Korea *Media of North Korea *Politics of North Korea *Telecommunications in North Korea ==References== == External links == * * Rodong Simun at KCNA Watch archives by NK News * Old archives at Defense Technical Information Center Category:Publications of the Workers' Party of Korea Category:Korean-language newspapers Category:North Korean news websites Category:Newspapers published in North Korea Category:Publications established in 1945 ",
