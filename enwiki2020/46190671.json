Threemile Creek was so named from the fact it is both long and three miles from the Ohio River. A defensive position originally called Threemile Creek Battery was built in 1861 as part of the Defense of Cincinnati in the Civil War and it took its name from the nearby creek. ==See also== *List of rivers of Kentucky ==References== Category:Bodies of water of Campbell County, Kentucky Category:Rivers of Kentucky ",
