(2015). One, four or 100 genera? A new classification of the cone snails. Journal of Molluscan Studies. 81: 1-23 ==Distinguishing characteristics== The Tucker & Tenorio 2009 taxonomy distinguishes Jaspidiconus from Conus in the following ways:Tucker J.K. & Tenorio M.J. (2009), Systematic Classification of Recent and Fossil Conoidean Gastropods, ConchBooks, Hankenheim, Germany, 295 pp. * Genus Conus sensu stricto Linnaeus, 1758 :: Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The basic shell shape is conical to elongated conical, has a deep anal notch on the shoulder, a smooth periostracum and a small operculum. The shoulder of the shell is usually nodulose and the protoconch is usually multispiral. Markings often include the presence of tents except for black or white color variants, with the absence of spiral lines of minute tents and textile bars. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The radula has an elongated anterior section with serrations and a large exposed terminating cusp, a non-obvious waist, blade is either small or absent and has a short barb, and lacks a basal spur. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found in the Indo-Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::These species eat other gastropods including cones. * Subgenus Jaspidiconus Petuch, 2003 ::Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The shell is turbinate in shape. The protoconch is paucispiral with 1.5 whorls. The anal notch is deep, and the anterior notch is absent. The early whorls are not nodulose but may be ornamented by an undulating carina. Later whorls may be ornamented with nodules. Cords are absent on the whorls. The periostracum is smooth, and the operculum is small. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The anterior sections of the radular tooth is shorter than the posterior section, and the blade is short. A posterior fold is present, and the posterior blade is absent. A basal spur is present, and the barb is short. A shaft fold is present and is blunt at its anterior end. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found in the West Atlantic region. ::Feeding habits :::These species are vermivorous, meaning that they prey on polychaete worms. ==Species== This list of species is based on the information in the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) list.

In 2009 however, J.K. Tucker and M.J. Tenorio proposed a classification system for the over 600 recognized species that were in the family. Their classification proposed 3 distinct families and 82 genera for the living species of cone snails, including the family Conilithidae. This classification was based upon shell morphology, radular differences, anatomy, physiology, cladistics, with comparisons to molecular (DNA) studies. Published accounts of genera within the Conidae (or Conilithidae) that include the genus Jaspidiconus include J.K. Tucker & M.J. Tenorio (2009), and Bouchet et al. (2011).Bouchet P., Kantor Yu.I., Sysoev A. & Puillandre N. (2011). \"A new operational classification of the Conoidea\". Journal of Molluscan Studies 77: 273-308.Petuch E.J. & Sargent D.M. (2011) New species of Conidae and Conilithidae (Gastropoda) from the tropical Americas and Philippines. With notes on some poorly-known Floridian species. Visaya 3(3): 37-58. [August 2011] Testing in order to try to understand the molecular phylogeny of the Conidae was initially begun by Christopher Meyer and Alan Kohn,Interview of Professor Alan Kohn, Professor Emeritus, Zoology and is continuing, particularly with the advent of nuclear DNA testing in addition to mDNA testing. However, in 2011, some experts still prefer to use the traditional classification, where all species are placed in Conus within the single family Conidae: for example, according to the current November 2011 version of the World Register of Marine Species, all species within the family Conidae are in the genus Conus. The binomial names of species in the 82 cone snail genera listed in Tucker & Tenorio 2009 are recognized by the World Register of Marine Species as \"alternative representations.\" http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=14107 Classification: Traditionally, all cone shells have been included in the Linnaean genus Conus. Tucker & Tenorio (2009) have recently proposed an alternative shell- and radula-based classification that recognizes 4 families and 80 genera of cones. In WoRMS, we currently still recognize a single family Conidae (following Puillandre et al. 2011), but Tucker & Tenorio's 80 genera classification is presented as \"alternative representation\". [P. Bouchet, 14 Aug. 2011] Debate within the scientific community regarding this issue continues, and additional molecular phylogeny studies are being carried out in an attempt to clarify the issue.C.M.L.
