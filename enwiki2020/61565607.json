The film's sets were designed by Manuel Fontanals. The film is about a family that is worried that their daughter is courted by a rich young man who likes the nightlife and luxury cars. The film is considered part of a group of family melodramas made in this period in which the dramatic tension revolves around old values, linked to a conservative order rooted in the past, which are pitted against new values associated with modernity, such as Cuando los hijos se van and A Family Like Many Others. ==Cast== *Domingo Soler as Don Gustavo Garc\u00eda *Carmelita Gonz\u00e1lez as Cristina *Sara Montes as Anita *Emma Rold\u00e1n as Lupe *V\u00edctor Parra as David Gonz\u00e1lez *Pepe del R\u00edo as Eduardo *Azucena Rodr\u00edguez as Pita *Manuel Noriega as Don Eusebio Echeverr\u00eda *Pepe Nava as Don Melchor *Enrique Zambrano as Don Ricardo *Victorio Blanco as Don Isaac Mart\u00ednez *Alfredo Varela as Sacerdote *Elisa Christy as Empleada de oficina de tienda (uncredited) *Conchita Gentil Arcos as Mar\u00eda Luisa Lucio, enfermera abortista (uncredited) *Gloria Lozano as Empleada de tienda (uncredited) ==References== ==Bibliography== * Garc\u00eda Riera, Emilio.
