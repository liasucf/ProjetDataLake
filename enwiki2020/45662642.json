    "text": "In abstract algebra, a structurable algebra is a certain kind of unital involutive non-associative algebra over a field. For example, all Jordan algebras are structurable algebras (with the trivial involution), as is any alternative algebra with involution, or any central simple algebra with involution. An involution here means a linear anti-homomorphism whose square is the identity. Assume A is a unital non-associative algebra over a field, and x \\mapsto \\bar{x} is an involution. If we define V_{x,y}z:=(x\\bar{y})z+(z\\bar{y})x-(z\\bar{x})y, and [x,y]=xy-yx, then we say A is a structurable algebra if: [V_{x,y} , V_{z,w}] = V_{V_{x,y}z,w} - V_{z,V_{y,x}w}. Structurable algebras were introduced by Allison in 1978.Garibaldi, p.658 The Kantor\u2013Koecher\u2013Tits construction produces a Lie algebra from any Jordan algebra, and this construction can be generalized so that a Lie algebra can be produced from an structurable algebra. Moreover, Allison proved over fields of characteristic zero that a structurable algebra is central simple if and only if the corresponding Lie algebra is central simple. Another example of a structurable algebra is a 56-dimensional non- associative algebra originally studied by Brown in 1963, which can be constructed out of an Albert algebra. When the base field is algebraically closed over characteristic not 2 or 3, the automorphism group of such an algebra has identity component equal to the simply connected exceptional algebraic group of type E6.Garibaldi, p.660 ==References== Category:Non- associative algebras ",
