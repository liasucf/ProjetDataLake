    "text": "The Colony is a 1996 TV film directed by Tim Hunter. == Plot == A man moves his family into a suburbia that at first seems fantastic, but soon turns into a nightmare. == Cast == == Reception == Hal Erickson of Rovi wrote \"Set in a high-price Malibu community, this made-for-TV drama wallows in a multitude of extramarital affairs, corporate intrigue and elegant back-stabbing, with murder the logical extension to all the hanky-panky. Characters crucial to the plotline are a cop posing as an auto mechanic, and a sexy nanny who intends to break up her best friend's marriage. The ending is abrupt and unsatisfying, a sure sign that the film was actually the pilot for an unsold series. Written and produced by Dynasty veterans Richard Shapiro and Esther Shapiro, The Colony was originally consigned to a 'dog day'\"http://www.moviefone.com/movie/the-colony/1368948/synopsis == References == == External links == * Category:American television films Category:American films Category:Canadian television films Category:Canadian films Category:1996 television films Category:Films directed by Tim Hunter Category:1996 thriller films Category:1996 films Category:Thriller television films ",
