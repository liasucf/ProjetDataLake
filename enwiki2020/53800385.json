Bushe was educated at Aysgarth School and Denstone College. He was called to the bar in 1909, and joined the chambers of Sir Edward Marshall Hall. In 1917, he joined the Colonial Office, becoming Legal Adviser to the Colonial Office and the Dominions Office in 1931. In 1941, Bushe was appointed Governor of Barbados. The promotion was said to be without precedent, as Bushe was the first colonial governor to be appointed from the Colonial Office legal staff. He retired in 1946. == References == Category:1868 births Category:1961 deaths Category:Governors of Barbados Category:People educated at Aysgarth School Category:People educated at Denstone College Category:British barristers Category:Knights Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:Civil servants in the Colonial Office Category:20th-century British lawyers ",
