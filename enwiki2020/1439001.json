    "text": "The New Yogi Bear Show (also known as Hanna-Barbera's Yogi Bear Show) is an American animated television series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions that aired in syndication from September 12 to November 11, 1988. It contained forty-five new episodes combined with reruns of the original 1961 series. Pared down from some of the other versions (the all-star cartoons with Huckleberry Hound, Quick Draw McGraw, Top Cat, and other Hanna-Barbera characters), this series featured only Yogi, Boo-Boo, Cindy and Ranger Smith, with episodes set in Jellystone Park. New characters were introduced for the series, such as, Ranger Roubideux (Ranger Smith's assistant who is chubby and tiny-sized), Ninja Raccoon (a Japanese raccoon cub who wears a kimono), and his mother. The series marked the debut of Greg Burson as the voice of Yogi following Daws Butler's death on May 18, 1988, four months prior to the series' debut. ==Episodes== ==Cast== * Greg Burson - Yogi Bear * Don Messick - Boo-Boo Bear, Ranger Smith * Julie Bennett - Cindy Bear * Peter Cullen - Ranger Roubideux * Frank Welker - Ninja Raccoon, Cruise Director (in \"Cruise Bruise\"), Slone Malone (in \"Double Trouble\"), Predaterminator (in \"Predaterminator\") ===Additional voices=== * David Ackroyd - * Charlie Adler - Director Sammy Baby (in \"Shine on Silver Screen\"), Buffalo Billy (in \"Buffalo'd Bear\") * Patricia Alice Albrecht - * George Ball - * Susan Blu - * William Callaway - * Richard Erdman - * Chad Everett - * Laurie Faso - Film Director (in \"Double Trouble\") * Miriam Flynn - Mom (in \"Old Biter\") * Pat Fraley - Yippee Wolf (in \"The Not So Great Escape\") * Lauri Fraser - Bibi the Biker (in \"Biker Bear\") * Teresa Ganzel - Hambo's Girl (in \"Double Trouble\") * Kathy Garver - * Dick Gautier - * Arlene Golonka - * Dana Hill - Tim (in \"Little Lord Boo Boo\") * Peter Leeds - * Allan Lurie - * Tress MacNeille - * Laurie Main - * Allan Melvin - Growler Bear (in \"Real Bears Don't Eat Quiche\") * Scott Menville - Cody (in \"Pokey the Bear\") * Howard Morris - Principal Pinecone (in \"Bear Obedience\") * Alan Oppenheimer - * Rob Paulsen - Bamba Bear (in \"La Bamba Bear\") * Henry Polic II - Corky Carny (in \"Come Back, Little Boo Boo\") * Jan Rabson - * Hal Smith - * John Stephenson - The Great Shadrak (in \"Shadrak Yogi\") * Cree Summer - * B.J.
