The film was a commercial success. It was considered as \"one of the few acceptable horror movies the Maldives film industry has ever produced\". The film was later released as a 15 episode television series with the inclusion of several clips that were cut from the theatrical release. The company then went on to produce a family drama film Fanaa (2010) which was directed by Aishath Rishmy. Based on a novel published by Waheed titled Balgish, the film received a mixed to negative response from critics; Ali Naafiz from Haveeru Daily classified the film as the \"worst Maldivian film released so far\" during the year. Their next production was Ahmed Azmeel's debut direction Hiyy Yaara Dheefa (2011), starring Ali Seezan, Aishath Rishmy, Niuma Mohamed, Ahmed Azmeel and Aminath Rasheedha. The film was a financial loss to the producers and received negative reviews from critics pointing to similarities with Bollywood comedy-drama film Ishq (1997) and Kundan Shah's family drama Dil Hai Tumhaara (2002). Six years later, they went on to produced Ravee Farooq's critically acclaimed crime thriller Vishka (2017) which revolves around a single-minded woman, Vishka, who gets trapped between an immoral person and a corrupt politician. Prior to release it faced controversies as Hassan Haleel requested a deferment in release claiming he allegedly owns the story and script of the film. However, the film was cleared for exhibition with the court order proclaiming that the ownership of the script and story belongs to Rishmy. Upon release, the film opened to a positive response from critics. The film was screened at the SAARC Film Festival 2017. == Films produced == {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\" !scope=\"col\"| Year !scope=\"col\"| Title !scope=\"col\"| Director(s) !scope=\"col\"| Producer(s) !scope=\"col\" | Cast ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | |- |2006 ! scope=\"row\" | Hukuru Vileyrey | Aishath Rishmy Aminath Rasheedha | Aminath Rasheedha | | style=\"text-align: center;\"| |- |2010 ! scope=\"row\" | Fanaa | Aishath Rishmy | Aminath Rasheedha | | style=\"text-align: center;\"| |- |2011 ! scope=\"row\" | Hiyy Yaara Dheefa | Ahmed Azmeel | | | style=\"text-align: center;\"| |- |2017 ! scope=\"row\" | Vishka | Ravee Farooq | Aishath Rishmy | | style=\"text-align: center;\"| |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:Yaaraa Productions films ",
