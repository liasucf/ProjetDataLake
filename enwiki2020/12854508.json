    "text": "J\u00e4\u00e4 jumalaga puberteet! (English: \"Farewell puberty!\") is the second album by Estonian punk rock band Singer Vinger. It was released in 1989. The only format available is 12\" LP. ==Cover photo== A notable aspect of the album is the front cover photo, which features many culturally significant people of the time, band members scattered among them. The photoshoot was done during the festival '88 on the Tallinn Song Festival Grounds. The idea came from Volmer, who asked as much available people as possible to gather under the singing arc. Many artists and other significant people in Estonian culture were gathered, among other random people, most notably it features PiL's John Lydon (holding the Estonian flag) and John McGeoch, who were performing in Rock Summer. Volmer has expressed regret, that some other important people were missing, like T\u00f5nis M\u00e4gi and Jaak Joala.J\u00e4\u00e4 jumalaga, keskiga: kes on Singer Vingeri heliplaadi kaanel? Also on the cover, where many people are named and pointed out with arrows, there is an \"X\" with the writing \"Frank (puudub)\" (absent), which references the ideal of having Frank Zappa there too, with other rock legends.
