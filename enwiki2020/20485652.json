    "text": "Johann Baptiste Horvath (, 13 July 1732 in K\u0151szeg \u2013 20 October 1799 in Buda) was a Hungarian Jesuit Professor of Physics and Philosophy at the Catholic university for teaching theology and philosophy in Nagyszombat, Kingdom of Hungary (now Trnava, Slovakia). He is most noted for his authorship of various textbooks. == Biography == Physica Generalis (1776). Physica Particularis (1770). Horvath entered the Jesuit order at 19 years of age (17 October 1751 in Trencs\u00e9n (Tren\u010d\u00edn), became a university professor, and subsequently authored the well-known Latin textbooks Physica Generalis (1767/1782, 496pp) and Physica Particularis (1770/1782, 472pp).O'Malley, J.W.

Physica Generalis deals primarily with classical mechanics and celestial mechanics, for example including a Copernican (heliocentric) diagram of the solar system, missing Uranus and Neptune, and a diagram of a highly-elliptical comet. Physica Particularis includes treatments of fluid mechanics, heat transfer and optics, and several chapters deal scientifically with the nascent field of electricity, where Horvath is thought to be the first Central European author to present electricity and magnetism in the same chapter. The coverage is eclectic, including topics like the aurora borealis, combustion, sound, rainbows, botany and lightning. The work is also notable for its reliance on experimental physics, since this branch of physics was still emerging as a reputable field, especially among Jesuit academics.Radnai Gyula . Jedliktarsasag.hu. Retrieved 20 October 2011. For example, Horvath cites experiments on electricity by Benjamin Franklin (1754). In addition to his physics textbooks, Horvath published the mathematics textbook Institutiones Matheseos, including sections covering arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry and conic sections. He was among the most important Central European physics textbook authors in the 18th century (see also Andreas Jaszlinszky as well as Leopold Biwald and Joseph Redlhamer), and an innovative proponent of Newtonian mechanics, which in hindsight was the correct theory rather than the Cartesian mechanics popular among some Continental philosophers.Kires, Marian. \"Some Historical Points of View on Electricity in the Slovak Region.\" @ http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Volta%20and%20the%20History%20of%20Electricity/V&H;%20Sect2/V&H;%20199-204.pdfMorovics, M.T. & A.

Diccionario historico de la compania de Jesus. p1955, 2001. By promoting the methods of Copernicus and Newton, influenced by the approach of Borgondio and Boscovich, Horvath represents a (correct) departure from \"accepted\" thinking in that region of Europe, and his works were widely distributed.Dobrzycki, J. \"The Reception of Copernicus' Heliocentric Theory.\" Springer (Poland), 1973 @ https://books.google.com/books?id=tAWp34_GYLAC&pg;=PA353&lpg;=PA353&dq;=horvath+institutiones&source;=web&ots;=R3N4-F2ajz&sig;=Z3JBlNsQLwvF5BCHHQDxdNTjARI&hl;=en&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&resnum;=7&ct;=result#PPA353,M1 He continued to publish and instruct students from a secular professorship after the Jesuit order was suppressed in 1773, and during his tenure the university faculty moved to modern-day Hungary (1777) to become the renowned University of Budapest.Proc of the American Catholic Philosophical Assoc.
