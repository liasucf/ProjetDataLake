Bar\u00e9 Ma\u00efnassara, a Maouri, a subgroup of Niger's Hausa ethnic majority, was born in Dogondoutchi in 1948, and pursued a military career. Ma\u00efnassara was named Army Chief of Staff in March 1995, under a constitution which had moved Niger from military rule in 1991.\"President Mainassara: A profile\", BBC News, April 9, 1999. ==Political conflict== Parliamentary elections in January 1995 resulted in cohabitation between President Mahamane Ousmane and a parliament controlled by his opponents, led by Prime Minister Hama Amadou.Jibrin Ibrahim and Abdoulayi Niandou Souley, \"The rise to power of an opposition party: the MNSD in Niger Republic\", Unisa Press, Politeia, Vol. 15, No. 3, 1996. Rivalry between Ousmane and Amadou effectively paralyzed the government, and Ma\u00efnassara seized power on January 27, 1996, pointing to the difficult political situation as justification.Kaye Whiteman, \"Obituary: Ibrahim Bare Mainassara\", The Independent (London), April 12, 1999. ==Rule of Niger== Under Ma\u00efnassara's rule, a new constitution was approved by referendum in May 1996, and a presidential election was held on July 7\u20138, 1996. Ma\u00efnassara took about 52% of the vote,Elections in Niger, African Elections Database. but the election was widely viewed as fraudulent. On the second day of polling he had the electoral commission dissolved and replaced it with another electoral commission; on the same day, he also had the four opposition candidates placed under house arrest, which lasted for two weeks.\"Niger: A major step backwards\", Amnesty International, October 16, 1996. Ma\u00efnassara was sworn in on August 7. The National Union of Independents for Democratic Renewal (UNIRD) was established in 1996 to support Ma\u00efnassara in that year's elections, but subsequently the Rally for Democracy and Progress-Jama'a was established as the ruling party. With the constitution barring presidents from leading parties, Hamid Algabid became leader of the RDP-Jama'a in August 1997.\"Niger \u2013 New party leader for RDP\", IRIN-WA Weekly Roundup 10\u201397 of Main Events in West Africa covering period August 19\u201325, 1997. Local elections were held in February 1999, and in early April the Supreme Court released results which showed the opposition winning more seats than Ma\u00efnassara's supporters; the Court also cancelled the results in many areas and ordered elections there to be held again.\"NIgeria: Partial result of local elections announced\", IRIN, April 8, 1999.\"Rapport de la Mission D'Oberservation des Elections Presidentelles et Legislatives des 17 Octobre et 24 Novembre 1999\", democratie.francophonie.org . The opposition called for protests against the cancellation of results on April 8. ==Death== On April 9, 1999, Ma\u00efnassara was ambushed and shot to death by soldiers, reportedly members of the Presidential Guard, at the airport in the capital city of Niamey as he was going to board a helicopter attempting to flee the country. The circumstances of the killing were not clear; rumors suggested that Ma\u00efnassara was attempting to flee the country. Initially his death was officially described as an \"unfortunate accident\", but this claim was widely considered implausible.\"Niger: The people of Niger have the right to truth and justice\" , Amnesty International, April 6, 2000.\"New military leader for Niger\", BBC News, April 12, 1999.\"Military rule ends in Niger\", BBC News, December 22, 1999. Coup leader Daouda Malam Wank\u00e9 succeeded him as head of state and initiated a political transition that ended with elections late in the year. The constitution adopted in a July 1999 referendum provides for an amnesty for participants in both the 1996 and 1999 coups. An investigation into Ma\u00efnassara's death had begun in June 1999, but following the amnesty it was ended in September.\"Niger: Conditions of the amnesty granted to the perpetrators of the coups d'\u00e9tat of 27 January 1996 and of 9 April 1999; possibility that some of the guilty, in particular the former director of national security and the head of the special unit, were imprisoned following the coup d'\u00e9tat of 9 April 1999, then released without conditions after the amnesty\", Research Directorate, Immigration and Refugee Board, Canada (UNHCR.org), October 29, 1999. The RDP-Jama'a has demanded an international inquiry into his death in the years since.\"Niger: Democratic Rally of the People-Jama'a-RDP (Rassemblement d\u00e9mocratique du peuple-Jama'a), including its leadership, its youth clubs, the role that the party holds following the assassination of President Ibrahim Ma\u00efnassara on 19 April 1999; whether its members are involved in strikes or demonstrations demanding an inquiry into the President's assassination. If so, the date and location of these strikes, and response of the current government to participants on strike; whether arrests were made following these strikes (April 1999 \u2013 September 2002)\", Research Directorate, Immigration and Refugee Board, Canada (UNHCR.org), September 19, 2002. ==References== Category:Presidents of Niger Category:Assassinated Nigerien politicians Category:Leaders who took power by coup Category:Leaders ousted by a coup Category:1948 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Assassinated heads of state Category:People murdered in Niger Category:Deaths by firearm in Niger Category:Rally for Democracy and Progress (Niger) politicians Category:Nigerien military personnel Category:Ambassadors of Niger to Algeria Category:People from Dosso Region ",
