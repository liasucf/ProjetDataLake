The new students include the fighter Cheung Ka- kong (Timmy Hung), son of a wealthy businessman Lok Yik-hin (Jonathan Cheung), personal female bodyguard Yeung Ching-wu (Toby Leung), model Siu Yuk (Regen Cheung) and behind came Yee Shan\u2019s daughter Lok Yeung (Tavia Yeung). The appearance of Lok Yeung triggers a painful memory in Kai Chung. Lok Yeung\u2019s purpose in staying in Wudang is to convince her mother to give her lodging establishment to a Hong Kong investment group so as to gain credit for herself. After a series of incidents, Yee Shan promises to give up the establishment if Lok Yeung manages to win a competition in three months. Meanwhile, Yee Shan purposely injures herself so Kai Chung can teach her taichi class. Eventually, Ching Tung overcomes his mental illness and becomes well again.
