    "text": "Sir Martin Hairer (born 14 November 1975) is an Austrian-British mathematician working in the field of stochastic analysis, in particular stochastic partial differential equations. He is Professor of Mathematics at Imperial College London, having previously held appointments at the University of Warwick and the Courant Institute of New York University. In 2014 he was awarded the Fields Medal, one of the highest honours a mathematician can achieve.Daniel Saraga: The equation Tamer, in: Horizons, Swiss National Science Foundation No. 103, p. 26\u20137 In 2020 he won the 2021 Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics. ==Early life and education== Hairer was born in Geneva, Switzerland. He attended the Coll\u00e8ge Clapar\u00e8de Geneva where he received his high school diploma in 1994. He entered a school science competition with sound editing software that was developed into Amadeus, and later continued to maintain the software in addition to his academic work; it continued to be widely used . He then attended the University of Geneva, where he obtained his Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics in July 1998, Master of Science in Physics in October 1998 and PhD in Physics under the supervision of Jean-Pierre Eckmann in November 2001. ==Research and career== Hairer is active in the field of stochastic partial differential equations in particular, and in stochastic analysis and stochastic dynamics in general. He has worked on variants of H\u00f6rmander's theorem, systematisation of the construction of Lyapunov functions for stochastic systems, development of a general theory of ergodicity for non- Markovian systems, multiscale analysis techniques, theory of homogenisation, theory of path sampling and theory of rough paths and, in 2014, on his theory of regularity structures. Under the name HairerSoft, he develops Macintosh software. ===Affiliations=== Artur Avila, Martin Hairer (at back), Maryam Mirzakhani, with Maryam's daughter Anahita) and Manjul Bhargava at the ICM 2014 in Seoul *Regius Professor of Mathematics, University of Warwick (2014) *Member of the scientific steering committee of ETHZ-ITS (since 2013) *Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9, member of scientific steering committee (since 2012) *Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach, member of steering committee (since 2013) *Editor, Probability Theory and Related Fields *Editor, Nonlinear Differential Equations and Applications *Editor, Annales Henri Poincar\u00e9 Ser.
