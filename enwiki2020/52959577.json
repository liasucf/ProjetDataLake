According to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, serious discussions about vertical evacuation began in the United States following the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami. The American Society of Civil Engineers adopted an updated edition of its building standards in September 2016, including tsunami hazards for the first time. The first vertical evacuation site in the United States was Ocosta Elementary School, constructed in 2015\u20132016 on the Pacific Ocean coast in Westport, Washington, where a Cascadia subduction zone magnitude 9+ earthquake is expected to cause great tsunamis. ==Horizontal evacuation== Signage in Thailand for horizontal evacuation from tsunami An alternative to vertical evacuation is horizontal evacuation, for instance a hurricane evacuation route. Critics of vertical evacuation planning have charged it with justifying even greater human density in areas prone to disaster, and prefer low density growth with horizontal evacuation planning. ==See also== *Emergency shelter * ==References== ===Bibliography=== * * * * ==Further reading== * Category:Emergency management Category:Earthquake and seismic risk mitigation ",
