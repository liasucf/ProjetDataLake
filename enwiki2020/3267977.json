    "text": "Willie James Williams (born December 26, 1970) is a former American football cornerback in the National Football League and current Head coach for Winston Churchill High School. He was drafted out of Western Carolina University by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1993, and spent the first 4 seasons of his 13-year career in Pittsburgh. He was a key member of the 1995 Steelers team that played in Super Bowl XXX. From 1997 to 2003, Williams played for the Seattle Seahawks, before returning to the Steelers for the 2004 and 2005 seasons. Williams had a much smaller role in 2005, but still posted 10 tackles, adding to his career totals of 602 tackles and 26 interceptions. Williams has the distinction of being the only player from the 1995 Steelers Super Bowl XXX roster to be a member of the 2005 Steelers Super Bowl XL roster. The Steelers defeated the Seahawks in that game 21-10 (though Williams was not active in Super Bowl XL, and did not dress with pads). He is also the cousin of Tamera Young of the Atlanta Dream (WNBA). On March 3, 2006, Willams and veteran QB Tommy Maddox, were released as salary cap cuts. Williams then retired from football. On January 26 2017, he was named the head coach for Winston Churchill High School.
