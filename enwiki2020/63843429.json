Originally established in 2009, the Hillpost was reestablished in 2020 as an online news publication. The Hillpost remains student-produced and published despite the institution not having a journalism degree program. The publication covers topics ranging from college athletics, campus policy, and student life at Rogers State University, and community events in the Claremore, Bartlesville, and Pryor Creek areas. ==History== Started in 2009 by RSU student Zach Stoycoff, the Hillpost began as a monthly print newspaper. It was produced in collaboration with the Claremore Daily Progress which allowed the student editors to print their newspaper for distribution on all three of Rogers State University's campuses and allowed for the newspaper to be inserted within regular issues of the Claremore Daily Progress. The Hillpost originally had its office on the second floor of Downs Hall. The original editorial staff of the Hillpost included: * Zachary Stoycoff, editor * Jeanice Davis, assistant editor * Bekah Warren, features editor * Tip Crowley, entertainment editor The Hillpost later established the campus tradition of naming a large, white swan on the university's Claremore campus \"Sarge\". The Hillpost would also go onto to receive several recognitions from the Oklahoma College Media Association (OCMA). In 2010, the Hillpost received one of two overall Award of Excellence recognitions. That year, several student editors placed in OCMA competitions for student editors. In 2020, the Hillpost reestablished itself as an online news publication. For almost 10 years, the Hillpost did not publish. ==Staff== === Current editors === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Name !! Title !! Hometown !!
