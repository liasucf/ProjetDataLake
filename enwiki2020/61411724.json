    "text": "John Cowan (12 December 1870\u20131937) was a Scottish footballer who played in the Football League for Aston Villa and Preston North End. ==Career== Cowan was born in Dumbarton began his football career with Vale of Leven and joined the stream of Scottish footballers playing in the English League in the summer of 1892, when he joined First Division Preston North End, making his Football League debut at Derby County that September. He missed only four matches as Preston finished runners up in the League Championship and played for Preston in the 1893 FA Cup semi final, its replay, Cowan scoring in a 2\u20132 draw, and its second replay, in which they were ultimately defeated 2\u20131 by Everton. He was a near ever present in 1893\u201394, missing only one match and scoring 4 goals in Preston\u2019s 18\u20130 FA Cup first round rout of Southern League Reading in January 1894. After 16 goals in 64 appearances for The Lilywhites he joined Rangers in the 1894 close season, making his Rangers debut against Dumbarton that August, and scoring 4 goals in 17 appearances before a return to England to join his younger brother James Cowan at Aston Villa the following August. Villa won the League in 1895\u201396, Cowan scored 9 goals in 22 games that season, and was part of a forward line that included Johnny Campbell, Jack Devey, Charlie Athersmith and Dennis Hodgetts. The following season proved the most glorious for Aston Villa. On 30 January, 1897, Aston Villa beat Newcastle United 5\u20130 in the third round of the FA Cup. They went onto beat Notts County (2\u20130), Preston North End (3\u20132) and Liverpool (3\u20130) to reach the Cup Final against Everton. A crowd of over 60,000 arrived at The Crystal Palace to watch the Final. Charlie Athersmith scored the opening goal but Everton hit back with goals from Jack Bell and Dickie Boyle. Aston Villa continued to dominate the game and added two more goals from Fred Wheldon and Jimmy Crabtree. That finished the scoring and therefore Aston Villa had emulated the great \u201cInvincibles\u201d Preston North End side that had achieved the FA Cup and Football League double in 1888\u201389. Aston Villa retained the League title by beating the runners up, Sheffield United, by 11 points. Villa scored 73 goals that season with Cowan scoring 7 in 15 games. However 1897\u201398 proved a disappointment, and Villa finished only sixth in the League, crashing out of the FA Cup in the first round, although Cowan still featured regularly. The following season however, as a result of the form of Stephen Smith, Cowan was unable to obtain a regular place in the 1898\u201399 League Championship winning team, only playing 7 games that season. After 27 goals in 71 appearances for Villa, Cowan moved to Dundee Harp in June 1899 before his eventual retirement in May 1901. ==Career statistics== Source: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=3|Preston North End |1892\u201393 |First Division |26||1||6||4||32||5 |- |1893\u201394 |First Division |29||7||2||4||31||11 |- !colspan=2|Total !55!!8!!8!!8!!63!!16 |- |rowspan=5|Aston Villa |1895\u201396 |First Division |22||9||1||0||23||9 |- |1896\u201397 |First Division |15||7||3||2||18||9 |- |1897\u201398 |First Division |22||5||1||0||23||5 |- |1898\u201399 |First Division |7||4||0||0||7||4 |- !colspan=2|Total !66!!25!!5!!2!!71!!27 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career Total !121!!33!!13!!10!!224!!43 |} ==References== Category:1870 births Category:1937 deaths Category:Scottish footballers Category:English Football League players Category:Association football forwards Category:Vale of Leven F.C. players Category:Preston North End F.C. players Category:Rangers F.C. players Category:Aston Villa F.C. players Category:Dundee Harp F.C. players ",
