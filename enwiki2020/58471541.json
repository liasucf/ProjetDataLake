The winning team represented Canada at the 2019 World Women's Curling Championship held from March 16 to 24 at the Silkeborg Sportscenter in Silkeborg, Denmark. The final game featured the largest comeback in Scotties Finals history (according to TSN statistics). Alberta's Chelsea Carey came back from a 1\u20135 deficit, winning the championship 8\u20136 thanks to 5 total steal points in the second half, and two dramatic misses by Ontario's Rachel Homan. This year's tournament was notable for Nunavut winning their first Scotties round robin game ever, defeating Quebec's Gabrielle Lavoie 4\u20133 in Draw 1; and the highest scoring game ever at a Canadian women's curling championship in Draw 10 with Prince Edward Island's Suzanne Birt winning 13\u201312 in an extra end over New Brunswick's Andrea Crawford, a total match score of 25 points. Team Canada's Jennifer Jones set a new record for the most Canadian national women's championship game wins as a skip when she skipped the 141st victory of her Scotties career over British Columbia's Sarah Wark in Draw 18 on February 22. ==Teams== Source: {| border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 !bgcolor=\"#ff7799\" width=\"250\"| Canada !bgcolor=\"#0055ff\" width=\"250\"| Alberta !bgcolor=\"#0099ff\" width=\"250\"| British Columbia !bgcolor=\"#ffff99\" width=\"250\"| Manitoba |- |St. Vital CC, Winnipeg Skip: Jennifer Jones Third: Kaitlyn Lawes Second: Jocelyn Peterman Lead: Dawn McEwen Alternate Jill Officer |The Glencoe Club, Calgary Skip: Chelsea Carey Third: Sarah Wilkes Second: Dana Ferguson Lead: Rachelle Brown |Abbotsford CC, Abbotsford Skip: Sarah Wark Third: Kristen Pilote Second: Carley Sandwith Lead: Jen Rusnell Alternate Michelle Dunn |East St. Paul CC, East St. Paul Skip: Tracy Fleury Third: Selena Njegovan Second: Liz Fyfe Lead: Kristin MacCuish Alternate: Taylor McDonald |- border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 !bgcolor=\"#ffff33\" width=\"250\"| New Brunswick !bgcolor=\"#ff5577\" width=\"250\"| Newfoundland and Labrador !bgcolor=\"#00CC66\" width=\"250\"| Northern Ontario !bgcolor=\"#cc99ee\" width=\"250\"| Nova Scotia |- |Thistle-St. Andrew's CC, Saint John Skip: Andrea Crawford Third: Jillian Babin Second: Jennifer Armstrong Lead: Katie Forward |Re/Max Centre, St. John's Skip: Kelli Sharpe Third: Stephanie Guzzwell Second: Beth Hamilton Lead: Carrie Vautour Alternate: Michelle Jewer |Fort William CC, Thunder Bay Skip: Krista McCarville Third: Kendra Lilly Second: Jen Gates Lead: Sarah Potts Alternate: Lorraine Lang |Mayflower CC, Halifax Skip: Jill Brothers Third: Erin Carmody Second: Sarah Murphy Lead: Jenn Brine Alternate: Kim Kelly |- border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 !bgcolor=\"#ff7777\" width=\"250\"| Ontario !bgcolor=\"#009900\" width=\"250\"| Prince Edward Island !bgcolor=\"#0ff\" width=\"250\"| Quebec !bgcolor=\"#3c0\" width=\"250\"| Saskatchewan |- |Ottawa CC, Ottawa Skip: Rachel Homan Third: Emma Miskew Second: Joanne Courtney Lead: Lisa Weagle Alternate: Cheryl Kreviazuk |Charlottetown CC, Charlottetown Skip: Suzanne Birt Third: Marie Christianson Second: Meaghan Hughes Lead: Michelle McQuaid |CC Victoria, Sainte-Foy, CC Jacques-Cartier, Sillery & CC Etchemin, Saint-Romuald Skip: Gabrielle Lavoie Third: Patricia Boudreault Second: Anna Munroe Lead: Julie Daigle Alternate Marie-France Larouche |Twin Rivers CC, North Battleford Skip: Robyn Silvernagle Third: Stefanie Lawton Second: Jessie Hunkin Lead: Kara Thevenot Alternate: Marliese Kasner |- border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 !bgcolor=\"#ccc\" width=\"250\"| Northwest Territories !bgcolor=\"#ffdd500\" width=\"250\"| Nunavut !bgcolor=\"#9966ff\" width=\"250\"| Yukon !bgcolor=\"#d5dbdb\" width=\"250\"| Wildcard |- |Yellowknife CC, Yellowknife Skip: Kerry Galusha Third: Sarah Koltun Second: Brittany Tran Lead: Shona Barbour |Iqaluit CC, Iqaluit Fourth: Jennifer Blaney Third: Alison Griffin Skip: Jenine Bodner Lead: Megan Ingram Alternate Sadie Pinksen |Whitehorse CC, Whitehorse Skip: Nicole Baldwin Third: Hailey Birnie Second: Ladene Shaw Lead: Helen Strong |Lethbridge CC, Lethbridge Skip: Casey Scheidegger Third: Cary-Anne McTaggart Second: Jessie Haughian Lead: Kristie Moore Alternate Susan O'Connor |} ;Notes # Team Canada's alternate Jill Officer threw lead stones for the last five ends of Draw 10 and threw second stones during Draw 12. # During Draw 5, Team British Columbia's alternate Michelle Dunn threw lead stones for two ends. # During Draw 11, Team Manitoba's alternate Taylor McDonald threw second rocks. # Team Newfoundland and Labrador alternate Michelle Jewer threw lead stones during the round robin; Carrie Vautour threw lead stones during Draws 4, 8, and 12. # Team Ontario alternate Cheryl Kreviazuk threw second stones for the last two ends of Draw 3, for the last four ends of Draw 5 and the last five ends of Draw 13. # Team Nunavut alternate Sadie Pinksen threw lead stones during the round robin; Megan Ingram threw lead stones for three ends in Draw 9. ===CTRS ranking=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !width=265| Member Association (Skip) !!width=15| Rank !!width=15| Points |- | (Homan) || 1 || 513.711 |- | (Jones) || 3 || 335.285 |- | (Carey) || 4 || 235.951 |- | (Fleury) || 5 || 231.427 |- | Wildcard (Scheidegger) || 6 || 210.455 |- | (Silvernagle) || 7 || 203.145 |- | (Wark) || 24 || 96.228 |- | (Birt) || 25 || 94.030 |- | (McCarville) || 32 || 74.408 |- | (Galusha) || 34 || 68.803 |- | (Brothers) || 36 || 64.257 |- | (Crawford) || 45 || 55.839 |- | || NR || 0.000 |- | (Bodner) || NR || 0.000 |- | (Lavoie) || NR || 0.000 |- | (Baldwin) || NR || 0.000 |} ==Wildcard game== A wildcard play-in game was played on February 15. It was contested between the top two teams in the Canadian Team Ranking System standings who did not win their respective provincial championships: the Gimli Curling Club's Kerri Einarson rink from Gimli, Manitoba and the Lethbridge Curling Club's Casey Scheidegger rink from Lethbridge, Alberta. Team Wildcard entered the Scotties as the number 4 seed. In advance of the 2018\u201319 season, Rachel Homan was guaranteed a spot in the wildcard game if her team did not win their provincial championship. The team was forced to decline their Team Canada berth in the 2018 Scotties due to qualifying for the Olympics. However, had Homan been eliminated from the provincials, her team would have qualified for the game without the guaranteed spot as they led the CTRS standings. ;CTRS standings for wildcard game: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
