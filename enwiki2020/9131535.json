The River Usk flows through the village as does the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal. It is in the historic county of Brecknockshire. ==The village== The village is located four miles west of Crickhowell and nine miles southeast of Brecon, beside the River Usk and the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal. It is situated on the B4558 just to the south of where this road diverges from the A40 trunk road. The stone bridge across the river dates from approximately 1700 and is a Grade I listed building. The canal has five locks and an aqueduct in the vicinity of the village. The village is notionally divided into Upper and Lower Llangynidr. The remains of what may be a medieval reeve's house have been discovered in the course of archaeological excavations in the centre of the village.Anthony, Michael.

At that time this village was part of the manor of Tretower.\"An Introduction to the History of Llangynidr\" Dorethea Watkins 1986 Langynidr Local History Society The land was then in the ownership of the Earls of Worcester until the nineteenth and early twentieth century when much of Llangynidr was part of the Glanusk Park estate. On the moors to the southeast of the village lies the Chartist Cave, the name of which derives from 1839 when Chartist rebels used the cave to stockpile weapons in advance of their march on Newport. There is a plaque at the entrance of the cave commemorating their actions. ==References== ==External links== *Photos of Llangynidr and surrounding area on geograph *Old photos of Llangynidr *Genuki on Llangynidr with links *Brecon Beacons Park Society on Llangynidr ==Further reading== *Shadows in a Landscape (Llangynidr Local History Society, 2000) *Stories Behind the Stone Cross (Llangynidr Local History Society, 2014) Category:Villages in Powys Category:Brecon Beacons Category:River Usk ",
