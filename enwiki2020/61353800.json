    "text": "How Did This Get Played? is an audio podcast that follows Heather Anne Campbell and Nick Wiger as they review the worst and weirdest video games of all time. Each episode focuses on a particular game and includes a guest, often people from the comedy world who also have an interest in video games. The co-hosts, producer Matt Apodaca, and guest(s) play the game ahead of the episode, then talk about the experience, the community and context surrounding the game. The hosts and guest(s) give their reviews of the game, and read contrary reviews of the game found online. Each week opens with a theme song by engineer Devon Torrey Bryant that remixes music of the game from that week's episode into the show's theme music. The show takes the same tone of the discussion as podcast network Earwolf's How Did This Get Made?, a podcast celebrating bad movies. ==Segments== The show has several featured segments in each episode, including: ===Review Crew=== In 'Review Crew', the hosts and guests each take turns sharing a positive comment about the game, as well as their own verbal review summary, and a numerical score on a scale from zero to 1 million. ===Maybe We\u2019re Wrong=== In the 'Maybe We're Wrong' segment (stylized as \"Maybe _We Were_ Wrong\" in the audio introduction to the segment), the hosts and producer take turns reading positive reviews of that episode's game. ===The Question Block=== In The Question Block, the hosts read questions from viewers (culled from Twitter) and give their answers, inviting the guest to answer as well. ==Episode list== ===2019=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:60%; margin:left;\" |- !style=\"color:white; background-color: #7491F1\" | No. !style=\"color:white; background-color: #7491F1\" | Episode title !style=\"color:white; background-color: #7491F1\" | Release date |- |} ===2020=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:60%; margin:left;\" |- !style=\"color:white; background-color: #7491F1\" | No. !style=\"color:white; background-color: #7491F1\" | Episode title !style=\"color:white; background-color: #7491F1\" | Release date |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:Audio podcasts Category:Comedy and humor podcasts Category:2019 podcast debuts Category:Earwolf Category:Video game podcasts ",
