    "text": "This is a list of schools in the Riverina region of New South Wales, Australia. The New South Wales education system traditionally consists of primary schools, which accommodate students from Year K to Year 6 (ages 5\u201312), and high schools, which accommodate students from Year 7 to Year 12 (ages 12\u201318). ==Public schools== ===Primary schools (K-6) === ===High schools=== In New South Wales, a high school generally covers Years 7 to 12 in the education system, and a central or community school, intended to provide comprehensive education in a rural district, covers Kindergarten to Year 12. An additional class of high schools has emerged in recent years as a result of amalgamations which have produced multi-campus colleges consisting of Junior and Senior campuses. While most schools are comprehensive and take in all students of high school age living within its defined school boundaries, some schools are either specialist in a given Key Learning Area, or selective in that they set examinations or other performance criteria for entrance. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !

Prior to the 1970s, most schools were founded by religious institutes, but with the decrease in membership of these institutes, together with major reforms inside the church, lay teachers and administrators began to take over the schools, a process completed by approximately 1995. The Catholic Education Office (CEO), located in the Wagga Wagga diocese of the Church, is responsible for coordinating administration, curriculum and policy across the Catholic school system. Preference for enrolment is given to Catholic students from the parish or local area, although non-Catholic students are admitted if room is available. ==== Catholic private schools ==== ==== Catholic high schools ==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
