The Art Gallery of Nova Scotia has a major travelling retrospective of Greer's work, retroActive, which opened in 2015. A reviewer wrote that the real story of this exhibition was that Greer changed from being a sculptor whose work was based on theory to being one who was object-based. Greer is the recipient of numerous awards and grants; in 2009 he received the prestigious Governor General's Award in Visual Arts in recognition of his lifetime achievement and significant contribution to contemporary Canadian visual art. He prefers sculpture as his language and tries to engage the viewer in being a human, thinking object among objects, a being \"of\" the world, a cultural object. == Honours == *Royal Canadian Academy of Arts *Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts ==References== === Bibliography === * ==External links== *John Greer *Gallery 1.1.1 Category:20th-century Canadian sculptors Category:Canadian male sculptors Category:20th-century male artists Category:21st-century Canadian sculptors Category:21st-century male artists Category:Living people Category:NSCAD University faculty Category:Members of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts winners Category:1944 births Category:People from Amherst, Nova Scotia Category:Artists from Nova Scotia ",
