    "text": "Zakaria Labyad (, ; born 9 March 1993) is a Dutch-born Moroccan professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Ajax in the Eredivisie. The player has previously represented the Netherlands U17 team at international level before switching his allegiance to Morocco and playing for them at the Under-23 level. ==Club career== ===PSV=== Born in Utrecht, Labyad came through the youth program of PSV. In January 2009, he extended his contract with PSV until the summer of 2012. Before joining PSV, Labyad played for USV Elinkwijk. Labyad made his debut in the senior team on 25 February 2010 in a UEFA Europa League home match against Hamburger SV, coming on as a substitute for Otman Bakkal in the 71st minute. Three days later, Labyad also made his debut in the Eredivisie, coming on as a substitute for Bal\u00e1zs Dzsudzs\u00e1k in a match against RKC Waalwijk. On 18 April 2010, Labyad made his first appearance in the starting line-up in a home match against FC Groningen. Labyad's selection in the starting line-up paid immediate dividends, with him scoring two goals in the 3\u20131 victory. In the last match of the 2009\u201310 season, Labyad was again in the starting lineup in a 1\u20131 draw against Alkmaar. Labyad more or less became a regular in the starting 11 in the 2011\u201312 season and experienced a great deal of success. He played in 32 matches and scored 6 goals. He scored a goal in the KNVB Beker semi final against Heerenveen and followingly won the cup with PSV. ===Sporting CP=== On 3 April 2012, Sporting CP's president revealed that Labyad will join the Portuguese team for the 2012\u201313 season, on a free transfer, signing a 5-year deal contract. However, on 23 May, PSV's technical director Marcel Brands told Dutch media that Labyad's contract was extended for another year since Labyad failed to formally terminate his contract before the legal deadline of 15 May. On 2 July 2012, he officially joined Sporting. In his first season, he made 20 appearances for the club in which he scored twice. ====Vitesse (loan)==== In January 2014, after not playing a single match for Sporting during the first half of the season, Labyad was sent on loan to Dutch side Vitesse until the summer of 2015. ====Return to Sporting CP==== Labyad returned to Sporting CP for the 2015\u201316 Primeira Liga season to work with new Sporting CP manager Jorge Jesus who insisted upon Labyad's return as part of him agreeing to accept the Sporting CP job offer. Indeed, Labyad was viewed as a \"pilar\" for the new Sporting CP by Jorge Jesus. ====Fulham (loan)==== On 1 February 2016, Labyad moved on loan to Fulham until the end of the 2015\u201316 season. On 31 August 2016, Sporting CP announced that both parties had agreed to terminate the contract. ===Utrecht=== On 5 January 2017, Labyad signed for Eredivisie side FC Utrecht until 2019. ===AFC Ajax=== On 14 May 2018, Labyad signed for Eredivisie side AFC Ajax. He signed a four-season contract until June 2022. ==Personal life== Labyad has said that he looks up to former PSV team-mate Ibrahim Afellay, stating \u201cIbrahim is my friend. I have a lot of respect for him, not only because he plays in the same position as me, but also because as a person, he\u2019s someone I look up to.\u201d During his time at PSV, Labyad lived in Utrecht with his family, so he had to commute by train every day to Eindhoven. He followed an education in \"Sport & Activity\" at the ROC Eindhoven. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|OtherEredivisie playoffs !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals |- |rowspan=\"4\"|PSV |2009\u201310 |rowspan=\"3\"|Eredivisie |6||2||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||7||2 |- |2010\u201311 |7||0||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||2||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||12||1 |- |2011\u201312 |32||6||6||5||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||10||2||colspan=\"2\"|=\"2\"|\u2013||48||13 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !45||8||9||5||0||0||13||3||0||0||67||16 |- |Sporting CP |2012\u201313 |Primeira Liga |19||2||0||0||2||0||6||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||27||3 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Vitesse (loan) |2013\u201314 |rowspan=\"2\"|Eredivisie |16||3||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||0||0||2||0||18||3 |- |2014\u201315 |29||8||2||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||4||1||35||10 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !45||11||2||1||0||0||0||0||6||1||53||13 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Sporting CP B |2015\u201316 |Segunda Liga |14||3||0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||14||3 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !14||3||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||14||3 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Fulham |2015\u201316 |Championship |2||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||2||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !2||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||2||0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Utrecht |2016\u201317 |rowspan=\"2\"|Eredivisie |14||3||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||4||0||19||3 |- |2017\u201318 |29||12||1||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||6||2||3||3||39||18 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !43||15||2||1||0||0||6||2||7||3||58||21 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Jong FC Utrecht |2016\u201317 |Eerste Divisie |2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !2||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||2||0 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Ajax |2018\u201319 |rowspan=\"3\"|Eredivisie |12||1||5||3||colspan=\"2'|\u2013||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||20||4 |- |2019\u201320 |2||1||0||0||colspan=\"2'|\u2013||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||3||1 |- |2020\u201321 |3||1||0||0||colspan=\"2'|\u2013||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||3||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !17||3||5||3||0||0||4||0||0||0||26||6 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !187||42||18||10||2||0||29||6||13||4||249||62 |} ;Notes ==Honours== ===Club=== PSV *KNVB Cup: 2011\u201312 Ajax *Eredivisie: 2018\u201319 *KNVB Cup: 2018\u201319 ==References== ==External links== * Zakaria Labyad at Voetbal International Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Berber Moroccans Category:Footballers from Utrecht (city) Category:Association football midfielders Category:Moroccan footballers Category:Morocco international footballers Category:Moroccan expatriate footballers Category:Dutch footballers Category:Dutch people of Moroccan descent Category:Dutch people of Moroccan-Berber descent Category:Dutch people of Riffian descent Category:USV Elinkwijk players Category:PSV Eindhoven players Category:Sporting CP footballers Category:SBV Vitesse players Category:Fulham F.C. players Category:FC Utrecht players Category:AFC Ajax players Category:Eredivisie players Category:Eerste Divisie players Category:Primeira Liga players Category:English Football League players Category:Expatriate footballers in Portugal Category:Olympic footballers of Morocco Category:Footballers at the 2012 Summer Olympics ",
