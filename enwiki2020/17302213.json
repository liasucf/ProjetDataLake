    "text": "The Big Nickel. Theodore Arthur \"Ted\" Szilva, (December 11, 1934 \u2013 March 9, 2016) was a Canadian businessman in Greater Sudbury, Ontario. He was best known for creating the city's \"Big Nickel\" landmark. Szilva was born and raised in the old city of Sudbury. He proposed the Big Nickel monument in 1963, when he was a 28-year-old firefighter.David Brazeau, \"A birthday; Sudbury's Big Nickel - a fireman's dream - is 30 years old\", Sudbury Star, 15 May 1994, A8. It subsequently became one of Sudbury's most recognizable features, and Szilva owned both the monument and the surrounding park area until 1981.\"City may lose its Big Nickel\", Globe and Mail, 16 June 1983, P10; Robert Aaron, \"New issues from Mexico good as gold\", Toronto Star, 31 December 1994, G2. Szilva was an active Roman Catholic. During the 1980s, he co-managed a successful private lottery named \"Pot `O' Gold\" that provided funding for Ontario's Catholic schools. When the provincial government of Bill Davis extended full funding to Catholic education in 1984, Szilva helped wind down the lottery and re-establish it as a charity fund. Some have suggested that Davis's decision to fund Catholic schools was predicated, in part, on his government's desire to re-establish control over the lottery sector. Szilva continued to co-manage the charity fund into the 2000s.Denis St. Pierre, \"Bishop fails in quest to control fund\", Sudbury Star, 4 September 1999, A1; Lara Bradley, \"`Look at all those zeros'\", Sudbury Star, 5 April 2000, A3; [Separate school funding coincided with the disappearance of a lucrative lottery Mark Bonokoski, \"Separate school funding coincided with the disappearance of a lucrative lottery\"], Sun Media, 9 September 2007, accessed 7 May 2008. Szilva was a longtime member of the Liberal Party of Canada and the Ontario Liberal Party, and played an organizational role in several political campaigns. He ran for Mayor of Sudbury against Peter Wong in 1985, but was defeated.Rudy Platiel, \"Leaders defeated all over the province\", Globe and Mail, 13 November 1985, A1. He endorsed Colin Firth's bid to become mayor in 2003,Harold Carmichael, \"Martin promise could be windfall for city\", Sudbury Star, 1 October 2003, A3. In this article, Szilva indicated that he had supported Jim Gordon when he started his political life. and unsuccessfully sought a seat on the Roman Catholic School Board in 2006. He was the inventor of the D-Best Keyholder,Harold Carmichael, \"Sudbury's idea man\", Sudbury Star, 8 November 2003, A1. and was president of D-Best Products. In 2009, he was made a member of the Order of Ontario. ==Footnotes== ==External links== *The Inventor (Ted Szilva curriculum vitae) Category:1934 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Businesspeople from Greater Sudbury Category:Members of the Order of Ontario ",
