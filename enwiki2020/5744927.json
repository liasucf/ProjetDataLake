    "text": "thumb Antonio S\u00e1enz (June 6, 1780 - July 22, 1825) was an Argentine statesman, educator and cleric. He was a representative to the Congress of Tucum\u00e1n of July 9, 1816, which declared the Independence of Argentina. He was the first rector of the University of Buenos Aires. S\u00e1enz was born in Buenos Aires. He studied at the Real Colegio de San Carlos between 1794 and 1800, gained his degree in 1802, and became a doctor in law in Chuquisaca in 1804, having been ordained as a priest some years before. In 1804, he entered the Academia Carolina as a practising lawyer. He became shortly afterwards a teacher of theology, law and philosophy. In 1805, S\u00e1enz was appointed secretary of the church cabildo, which brought him into the public eye. His appointment was opposed by the Bishop of Buenos Aires, , and they fought publicly, culminating in S\u00e1enz's imprisonment and trial. He was freed thanks to the intervention of the city's cabildo. He took part in the revolutionary events of May 1810 and represented San Luis Province in the 1813 Assembly. Thanks to his profile and links, he was also part of the Lautaro Lodge. In 1812 it was S\u00e1enz that found the dead body of Bishop Lue and suspicion was immediately placed on the younger priest, given the two men's history, an accusation he never shook off. The religious authorities sent him to Luj\u00e1n in a form of exile. He took no further part in church administration. S\u00e1enz was elected by Buenos Aires to the Congress of Tucum\u00e1n and helped to write the declaration of independence in 1816, in his capacity as President of the Academy of Jurisprudence. In 1819 he was the Congress' President. He helped to found the University of Buenos Aires and became its first rector in 1821. ==References== * Profile by the House of Tucum\u00e1n Category:1780 births Category:1825 deaths Category:Members of the Congress of Tucum\u00e1n Category:Argentine lawyers Category:People from Buenos Aires Category:Members of the Assembly of the Year XIII Category:People of the Argentine War of Independence Category:Burials at La Recoleta Cemetery ",
