The organization's curricula seek to address all aspects of the girls' development in order to enhance their physical, emotional, mental, social, and spiritual well-being while establishing a lifetime appreciation towards health and fitness. Local chapters (called \"councils\") operate under an umbrella organization, Girls on the Run International, which develops curricula and provides support to said councils. Girls on the Run International also encourages the formation of additional councils in areas not yet served by the program. ==Mission== The organization describes its mission as follows: \"We inspire girls to be joyful, healthy and confident using a fun, experience- based curriculum which creatively integrates running.\"Girls On the Run International, 2013 Annual Report.

The Girls on the Run curriculum inspires girls to define their lives on their own terms. Throughout the season, the girls make new friends, build their confidence, and celebrate all that makes them unique.3rd-5th Grade Program, Girls on the Run; accessed 2014.03.18. The Girls on the Run lessons encourage positive emotional, social, mental, and physical development. The Girls on the Run program uses the tenants of sports-based youth development to determine program activities, curricula, staff training, and guiding principles. Participants explore and discuss their own beliefs around experiences and challenges girls face at this age. They also develop strategies and skills to help them navigate life experiences. The program starts with helping girls get a better understanding of who they are and what is important to them. Then, participants look at the importance of teamwork and healthy relationships. Finally, the girls explore how they can positively connect with and shape the world. Physical activity is woven into the program to inspire an appreciation of fitness and in order to build habits that lead to a lifetime of health. At the end of each three-month session, the girls participate in a Girls on the Run 5k event, which involves other Girls on the Run teams from the community and possibly other councils. This celebratory, non-competitive event is the culminating experience of the curriculum. Coaches, parents, and community members participate, cheer, and celebrate. ===Heart & Sole=== Middle-school girls face many challenges that can affect their emotional and physical well-being, and which are different from those faced by younger girls. The Heart & Sole curriculum is designed to address these challenges by empowering participants to make thoughtful and healthy decisions. Like Girls on the Run, the Heart & Sole curriculum is delivered over the course of 10 to 12 weeks and addresses the societal, mental, and emotional challenges peculiar to that age.6th-8th Grade Program, Girls on the Run; accessed 2014.03.18. Like the curriculum for younger girls, Heart & Sole begins by encouraging the participants to examine and better understand who they are and what is important to them. Once they have a deeper awareness of their individual values, they look at the role of teams and healthy relationships. Lastly, the girls explore how they can positively connect with and shape the world. The curriculum allows for more mature handling of such topics as eating disorders, internet safety, relationships, cyber-bullying and tobacco and alcohol use. Participants discuss these subjects on an in-depth level and use their personal experiences to shape thought-provoking interaction. The Heart & Sole curriculum is designed to provide each girl with \"the skills to shut out the noise of the external world that is attempting to limit who she is and to instead listen to her individual truth \u2013 the one that will lead her toward an enriching and contented life.\" As may be expected, running is a significant part of the curriculum. Heart & Sole uses physical activity to inspire and motivate girls throughout the program. This physical activity is designed to encourage a lifelong appreciation for health and fitness, as well as to build confidence through a sense of accomplishment. At the end of each season (fall and spring),girls and their running buddies complete in the semiannual 5k running event, which gives the girls a tangible sense of achievement, as well as a framework for setting and achieving life goals. ==References== ==External links== *Girls on the Run International Category:Exercise organizations Category:Non-profit organizations based in North Carolina Category:Service organizations based in the United States Category:Organizations based in Charlotte, North Carolina Category:Organizations established in 2006 Category:Women's organizations based in the United States ",
