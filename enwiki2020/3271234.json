They are thought to have arrived between 1852 and 1856 and are listed on the 1860 Mendocino County census, Big River township: Lloyd (56 years, a farmer born in Tennessee), Samuel (26 years, a farmer born in Missouri) and Harvey (24 years, a stock man born in Missouri). The Bealls joined the Moore Brothers who had preempted land and erected dwellings a short distance from the ocean north of the bay. Shortly after, in 1856, W.H. Kent purchased the Beall tract and until 1864 when it was changed to Littleriver Bay, the place was known as Beall's Harbor and Kent's Landing. Ruel Stickney, Silas Coombs, and Tapping Reeves built a mill here, which provided the stimulus for the formation the town of Little River. This coastal mill town grew with the success of the mill so that eventually a schoolhouse, post house, shipyard, hotels, stores and blacksmith shops all established themselves here.Little River, History of Mendocino County California - Alley, Bowen & Co., San Francisco, 1880 Little River prospered in a similar way to many other towns on the Mendocino Coast until the nearby inland timber stands faltered. In the case of Little River, the mill closed in 1893. The loss of the mill shrunk the town and since that time it has served mainly as a tourist destination due to its beaches and Van Damme State Park, which the Little River runs through. The first road that ran through this area was the Anderson Valley and Big River Wagon Road (1966 GLO Plat). This road was likely widened and altered over the years until it was eventually added to the State Highway System. The Little River post office opened in 1865, changed its name to Littleriver in 1894, closed in 1929, and re-opened as Little River in 1930. ==Film industry== The Heritage House Inn, a bed and breakfast in Little River, was the location for the film Same Time, Next Year starring Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn. ==Geography== According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers an area of 1.7 square miles (4.3 km), all of it land. ==Demographics== The 2010 United States Census reported that Little River had a population of 117.
