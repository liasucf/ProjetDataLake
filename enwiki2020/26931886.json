It has members from all over the world. Its mountain terrain is difficult because the ball often breaks in the opposite direction from what golfers are expecting. The signature hole is the 13th, a 435-yard, par 4, which is located at the highest point on the course and offers beautiful view of the course and the surrounding valley. The elevated tee plays downhill and then requires an uphill approach to the elevated green, which slopes to the left and is protected by sand on the right and large bumps on the left side. ==References== *ScoreGolf: Mount Bruno Country Club in St-Bruno, Quebec, Canada ==External links== *Mount Bruno Country Club Category:Golf clubs and courses in Quebec Category:Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville ",
