She was interested in art from her early youth, and in 1910, her desire to paint led her to enter the School of Fine Arts, where she studied under Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Sotomayor y Zaragoza and developed marked talent in portraiture. Her paintings won commendation from competent critics and were awarded prizes in several exhibitions: in the Exposition of 1910, she was given third prize; in 1915, second prize, and in 1919, a like honor for the portrait of her husband, Ricardo Davila Silva. ==References== * Category:1883 births Category:People from Santiago Category:Chilean women artists Category:Portrait artists Category:Year of death missing ",
