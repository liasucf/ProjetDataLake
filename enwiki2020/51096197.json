The family originated in the Grand Duchy of Moscow and Teodor was related to the boyar Ivan Lacki, who had fled Moscow in 1535 with Siemion Bielski and entered the service of the king of Poland.Maciej Stryjkowski, Kronika polska, litewska, \u017cmudzka i wszystkij Rusi, vol. 2 (Warsaw: 1852): 107. Teodor Lacki traveled a great deal. He spent 1584-86 in Italy, and later went to France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Malta. While in Rome in 1589, Lacki worked with Michael Sendivogius on alchemical experiments to turn copper into silver. He began his military service during the reign of Stefan B\u00e1thory and fought in the Livonian Wars under Sigismund III Vasa. For his efforts in the wars, Lacki was rewarded with an appointment as the Lithuanian field writer and an income.Leszek Podhorodecki, Rapier i koncerz, Ksi\u0105\u017cka i Wiedza (Warszawa: 1985): 101-102.
