In 2014, it was re-released on Virgin Records. In 2019, the album was removed from all streaming services and digital retailers, as Lizzo wanted to rebrand 2016's Coconut Oil EP and her signing with Atlantic Records as the true beginning of her career. However on February 21, 2020, the album returned to streaming services. ==Music videos== Music videos were created for \"Batches & Cookies\", \"Faded\", \"Bus Passes and Happy Meals\", and \"Paris\". Impose included the video for \"Batches & Cookies\" on the \"Best Videos of 2013\" list. ==Critical reception== At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 85, based on 5 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Dylan Kilby of MusicOMH gave the album 4 stars out of 5, describing it as \"a triumphant album by an extraordinary artist and woman, whose girl-empowering lyricism and social consciousness puts her at the top of the underground and alternative hip-hop community.\" Killian Fox of The Guardian gave the album 4 stars out of 5, saying: \"At times joyfully nonsensical, Lizzo's stream-of-consciousness rhymes can also be lethally pointed.\" Star Tribune placed the album at number 1 on the \"Twin Cities Critics Tally 2013\" list. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the 2014 vinyl edition's liner notes. * Lizzo \u2013 vocals, flute * Cliff Rhymes \u2013 vocals * Sophia Eris \u2013 vocals (on \"Batches & Cookies\") * Lazerbeak \u2013 production * Ryan Olson \u2013 production * Plain Ole Bill \u2013 turntables * Jake Hansen \u2013 guitar * Jim Anton \u2013 bass guitar * James Buckley \u2013 bass guitar * Erica Burton \u2013 viola * Nelson Devereaux \u2013 saxophone * Joey Van Phillips \u2013 vibraphone, percussion * BJ Burton \u2013 mixing * Huntley Miller \u2013 mastering * Garrett Born \u2013 photography * Jeffrey Barr \u2013 logo * Paper Tiger \u2013 layout * Drew Christopherson \u2013 layout ==References== ==External links== * Category:2013 debut albums Category:Lizzo albums Category:Albums produced by Lazerbeak Category:Totally Gross National Product albums ",
