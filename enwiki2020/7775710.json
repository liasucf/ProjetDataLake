    "text": "Luis Arturo Mena Irarr\u00e1zabal (born 28 August 1979) is a Retired Chilean professional footballer. He is the only player in Chilean football history to win more than 10 domestic league titles. He also holds more than 300 appearances for Colo-Colo, with 7 goals. Because of this, Mena has been dubbed by Chilean press and Colo Colo fans as the \"historic one\" (el historico). He made his professional debut with Colo-Colo more than a decade ago on November 26, 1996 in the final of the Copa Chile against Rangers. He has spent his entire career, except one year when he was playing on loan at Puerto Montt, playing with Colo-Colo as a defender. Mena was the captain of the Under-20 Chilean national team between 1998 and 1999. He has been described as \"not the most flashiest or talented footballer\", but Mena is known for his loyalty to Colo-Colo and his calm leadership on the field. ==Honours== ===Club=== ;Colo- Colo * Primera Divisi\u00f3n de Chile (11): 1996, 1997\u2013C, 1998, 2002\u2013C, 2006\u2013A, 2006\u2013C, 2007\u2013A, 2007\u2013C, 2008\u2013C, 2009\u2013C, 2014\u2013C * Copa Chile: 1996 ==References== * Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Chilean people of Basque descent Category:Chilean footballers Category:Colo-Colo footballers Category:Puerto Montt footballers Category:Chile international footballers Category:Chilean Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Association football defenders ",
