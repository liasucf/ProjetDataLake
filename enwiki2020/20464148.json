    "text": "There are over 9,300 Grade I listed buildings in England. This page is a list of these buildings in the county of Isle of Wight. In the United Kingdom, the term listed building refers to a building or other structure officially designated as being of special architectural, historical, or cultural significance; Grade I structures are those considered to be \"buildings of exceptional interest\". Listing was begun by a provision in the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. Once listed, strict limitations are imposed on the modifications allowed to a building's structure or fittings. In England, the authority for listing under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 rests with English Heritage, a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport; local authorities have a responsibility to regulate and enforce the planning regulations. ==Buildings== |} ==See also== *Grade II* listed buildings on the Isle of Wight ==Notes== ==References == ==External links== *National Heritage List for England Isle of Wight Category:Lists of listed buildings on the Isle of Wight ",
