She went to Blackpool Art College and worked at various arts and crafts, floristry and painting. After receiving her acapella songs through the post, Jamie Nelson organised the early recordings that became the basis of her debut album. David Boyd signed Kirkham to a five album deal with Hut/Virgin and in 2003 That Girl was released. Six months into her deal, Hut closed and Kirkham began writing for her second album. Sunlight on My Soul was released in 2006. Receiving reviews throughout the UK, critics praised her bold progression on an album that encompasses tudor madrigals, celtic folk, country and jazzy pop. Kirkham's third album Tiny Spark was released on 22 January 2016. It was recorded and produced by Phil Thornalley, and co-produced by Mads Hauge. ==Discography== ===Albums=== *That Girl (Hut/Virgin) \u2013 29 September 2003 *Sunlight on My Soul (SLK Music) \u2013 6 February 2006 *Tiny Spark (Easy Action Recordings) \u2013 22 January 2016 ===Singles=== *\"Inappropriate\" *\"Show Me What You're Made Of\" *\"Easy As 123\" *\"Best Time Ever\" *\"Future Come On\" ==References== == External links == *StephanieKirkham.com \u2013 Official website *Official Itunes *Official YouTube Channel Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:English singer- songwriters ",
