It is particularly common on mobile phones and pagers and usually supplements the ring tone. Most 21st-century mobile phones are fitted with a vibrating alert, as are smartwatches. Vibrating alerts are primarily used when a user cannot hear the ring tone (a noisy environment or through hearing loss) or wants a more discreet notification (such as in a theatre).
