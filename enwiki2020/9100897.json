    "text": "In the mathematical theory of knots, a satellite knot is a knot that contains an incompressible, non boundary-parallel torus in its complement.Colin Adams, The Knot Book: An Elementary Introduction to the Mathematical Theory of Knots, (2001), Every knot is either hyperbolic, a torus, or a satellite knot. The class of satellite knots include composite knots, cable knots and Whitehead doubles. (See Basic families, below for definitions of the last two classes.) A satellite link is one that orbits a companion knot K in the sense that it lies inside a regular neighborhood of the companion. Example 1: A connect-sum of a trefoil and figure-8 knot. A satellite knot K can be picturesquely described as follows: start by taking a nontrivial knot K' lying inside an unknotted solid torus V. Here \"nontrivial\" means that the knot K' is not allowed to sit inside of a 3-ball in V and K' is not allowed to be isotopic to the central core curve of the solid torus. Then tie up the solid torus into a nontrivial knot. Example 2: The Whitehead double of the figure-8. This means there is a non-trivial embedding f\\colon V \\to S^3 and K=f(K'). The central core curve of the solid torus V is sent to a knot H, which is called the \"companion knot\" and is thought of as the planet around which the \"satellite knot\" K orbits. The construction ensures that f(\\partial V) is a non-boundary parallel incompressible torus in the complement of K. Composite knots contain a certain kind of incompressible torus called a swallow-follow torus, which can be visualized as swallowing one summand and following another summand. Example 3: A cable of a connect-sum. Since V is an unknotted solid torus, S^3 \\setminus V is a tubular neighbourhood of an unknot J. The 2-component link K' \\cup J together with the embedding f is called the pattern associated to the satellite operation. A convention: people usually demand that the embedding f \\colon V \\to S^3 is untwisted in the sense that f must send the standard longitude of V to the standard longitude of f(V). Said another way, given any two disjoint curves c_1,c_2 \\subset V, f preserves their linking numbers i.e.: lk(f(c_1),f(c_2))=lk(c_1,c_2). ==Basic families== When K' \\subset \\partial V is a torus knot, then K is called a cable knot. Examples 3 and 4 are cable knots. If K' is a non-trivial knot in S^3 and if a compressing disc for V intersects K' in precisely one point, then K is called a connect-sum. Another way to say this is that the pattern K' \\cup J is the connect-sum of a non- trivial knot K' with a Hopf link. If the link K' \\cup J is the Whitehead link, K is called a Whitehead double. If f is untwisted, K is called an untwisted Whitehead double. ==Examples== Example 1: The connect-sum of a figure-8 knot and trefoil. Example 2: Untwisted Whitehead double of a figure-8. Example 3: Cable of a connect-sum. Example 4: Cable of trefoil. Examples 5 and 6 are variants on the same construction. They both have two non-parallel, non- boundary-parallel incompressible tori in their complements, splitting the complement into the union of three manifolds. In Example 5 those manifolds are: the Borromean rings complement, trefoil complement and figure-8 complement. In Example 6 the figure-8 complement is replaced by another trefoil complement. Example 4: A cable of a trefoil. Example 5: A knot which is a 2-fold satellite i.e.: it has non-parallel swallow-follow tori. Example 6: A knot which is a 2-fold satellite i.e.: it has non-parallel swallow-follow tori. ==Origins== In 1949 Schubert, H. Die eindeutige Zerlegbarkeit eines Knotens in Primknoten. S.-B Heidelberger Akad. Wiss. Math.-Nat. Kl. 1949 (1949), 57-104. Horst Schubert proved that every oriented knot in S^3 decomposes as a connect-sum of prime knots in a unique way, up to reordering, making the monoid of oriented isotopy-classes of knots in S^3 a free commutative monoid on countably-infinite many generators. Shortly after, he realized he could give a new proof of his theorem by a close analysis of the incompressible tori present in the complement of a connect-sum. This led him to study general incompressible tori in knot complements in his epic work Knoten und Vollringe,Schubert, H. Knoten und Vollringe. Acta Math. 90 (1953), 131-286. where he defined satellite and companion knots. ==Follow-up work== Schubert's demonstration that incompressible tori play a major role in knot theory was one several early insights leading to the unification of 3-manifold theory and knot theory. It attracted Waldhausen's attention, who later used incompressible surfaces to show that a large class of 3-manifolds are homeomorphic if and only if their fundamental groups are isomorphic.Waldhausen, F. On irreducible 3-manifolds which are sufficiently large.Ann. of Math. (2) 87 (1968), 56-88. Waldhausen conjectured what is now the Jaco-Shalen-Johannson-decomposition of 3-manifolds, which is a decomposition of 3-manifolds along spheres and incompressible tori. This later became a major ingredient in the development of geometrization, which can be seen as a partial-classification of 3-dimensional manifolds. The ramifications for knot theory were first described in the long-unpublished manuscript of Bonahon and Siebenmann.F.Bonahon, L.Siebenmann, New Geometric Splittings of Classical Knots, and the Classification and Symmetries of Arborescent Knots, ==Uniqueness of satellite decomposition== In Knoten und Vollringe, Schubert proved that in some cases, there is essentially a unique way to express a knot as a satellite. But there are also many known examples where the decomposition is not unique.Motegi, K. Knot Types of Satellite Knots and Twisted Knots. Lectures at Knots '96. World Scientific. With a suitably enhanced notion of satellite operation called splicing, the JSJ decomposition gives a proper uniqueness theorem for satellite knots.Eisenbud, D. Neumann, W.
