    "text": "Belle de Jour () is a 1967 drama film directed by Luis Bu\u00f1uel, and starring Catherine Deneuve, Jean Sorel, and Michel Piccoli. Based on the 1928 novel Belle de jour by Joseph Kessel, the film is about a young woman who spends her midweek afternoons as a high-class prostitute, while her husband is at work. The title of the film is a pun on the French term, \"belle de nuit\" (\"lady of the night\", i.e., a prostitute), as S\u00e9verine works during the day under the pseudonym \"Belle de Jour\". Her nickname can also be interpreted as a reference to the French name of the daylily (Hemerocallis), meaning \"beauty of [the] day\", a flower that blooms only during the day. Belle de Jour is one of Bu\u00f1uel's most successful and famous films. It won the Golden Lion and the Pasinetti Award for Best Film at the Venice Film Festival in 1967. == Plot == S\u00e9verine Serizy (Catherine Deneuve), a young and beautiful housewife, is unable to share physical intimacy with her husband, Dr. Pierre Serizy (Jean Sorel), despite their love for each other. Her sexual life is restricted to elaborate fantasies involving domination, sadomasochism, and bondage. Although frustrated by his wife's frigidity toward him, he respects her wishes. While visiting a ski resort, they meet two friends, Henri Husson (Michel Piccoli) and Ren\u00e9e (Macha M\u00e9ril). S\u00e9verine does not like Husson's manner and the way he looks at her. Back in Paris, S\u00e9verine meets up with Ren\u00e9e and learns that a common friend, Henriette, now works at a brothel. At her home, S\u00e9verine receives roses from Husson and is unsettled by the gesture. At the tennis courts, she meets Husson and they discuss Henriette and houses of pleasure. Husson mentions a high-class brothel to S\u00e9verine at 11 Cit\u00e9 Jean de Saumur. He also confesses his desire for her, but S\u00e9verine rejects his advances. Haunted by childhood memories, including one involving a man who appears to touch her inappropriately, S\u00e9verine goes to the high-class brothel, which is run by Madame Ana\u00efs (Genevi\u00e8ve Page). That afternoon S\u00e9verine services her first client. Reluctant at first, she responds to the \"firm hand\" of Madame Ana\u00efs, who names her \"Belle de Jour,\" and has sex with the stranger. After staying away for a week, S\u00e9verine returns to the brothel and begins working from two to five o'clock each day, returning to her unsuspecting husband in the evenings. One day, Husson comes to visit her at home, but S\u00e9verine refuses to see him. Still, she fantasizes about having sex with him in her husband's presence. At the same time, S\u00e9verine's physical relationship with her husband is improving and she begins having sex with him. S\u00e9verine becomes involved with a young gangster, Marcel (Pierre Cl\u00e9menti), who offers her the kind of thrills and excitement of her fantasies. When Marcel becomes increasingly jealous and demanding, S\u00e9verine decides to leave the brothel, with Madame Ana\u00efs' agreement. S\u00e9verine is also concerned about Husson, who has discovered her secret life at the brothel. After one of Marcel's gangster associates follows S\u00e9verine to her home, Marcel visits her and threatens to reveal her secret to her husband. S\u00e9verine pleads with him to leave, which he does, referring to her husband as \"the obstacle\". Marcel waits downstairs for Pierre to return home, and shoots him three times. Marcel then flees, but is shot dead by police. S\u00e9verine's husband survives, but is left in a coma. The police are unable to find a motive for the attempted murder. Sometime later S\u00e9verine is at home taking care of Pierre, who is now completely paralyzed, blind, and in a wheelchair. Husson visits Pierre to tell him the truth about his wife's secret life; she does not try to stop him. Afterwards, S\u00e9verine, looking at Pierre, who is crying, begins to dream that Pierre is suddenly in perfect health. He asks what she is thinking about. She replies, \"About you, Pierre.\" == Cast == * Catherine Deneuve as S\u00e9verine Serizy, alias Belle de Jour * Jean Sorel as Pierre Serizy * Michel Piccoli as Henri Husson * Genevi\u00e8ve Page as Madame Ana\u00efs * Pierre Cl\u00e9menti as Marcel * Fran\u00e7oise Fabian as Charlotte * Macha M\u00e9ril as Ren\u00e9e * Maria Latour as Mathilde * Marguerite Muni as Pallas * Francis Blanche as Monsieur Adolphe * Fran\u00e7ois Maistre as The professor * Georges Marchal as Duke * Francisco Rabal as Hyppolite == Production == ;Costume design Much of Deneuve's wardrobe was designed by Yves St. Laurent. ;Filming locations * 1 Square Albin-Cachot, Paris 13, Paris, France * 79 Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, Paris 8, Paris, France * Chalet de la Grande Cascade, Bois de Boulogne, Paris 16, Paris, France * Champs Elys\u00e9es, Paris 8, Paris, France * Rue de Messine, Paris 8, Paris, France (Serizy's home) == Release == === Awards and nominations === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"80%\" |- ! width=\"5%\"| Year ! width=\"50%\"| Award ! width=\"20%\"| Recipient ! width=\"5%\"| Result |- | 1967 | Venice Film Festival Golden Lion Award | Luis Bu\u00f1uel | |- | 1967 | Venice Film Festival Pasinetti Award for Best Film | Luis Bu\u00f1uel | |- | 1968 | Bodil Award for Best European Film | Luis Bu\u00f1uel | |- | 1968 | French Syndicate of Cinema Critics Award for Best Film | Luis Bu\u00f1uel | |- | 1969 | BAFTA Award Nomination for Best Actress | Catherine Deneuve | |} === Home media === American director Martin Scorsese promoted a 1995 limited re-release in Americaper DVD extras trailer and a 2002 release on DVD. == Legacy == In 2006, the Portuguese director Manoel de Oliveira released Belle Toujours, imagining a future encounter between the characters of S\u00e9verine and Henri Husson from the original film.
