    "text": "This is a list of former high school athletic conferences in the East and Southeast Regions of Ohio, as designated by the OHSAA. If a conference had members that span multiple regions, the conference is placed in the article of the region most of its former members hail from. Because the names of localities and their corresponding high schools do not always match and because there is often a possibility of ambiguity with respect to either the name of a locality or the name of a high school, the following table gives both in every case, with the locality name first, in plain type, and the high school name second in boldface type. The school's team nickname is given last. ==Adams County League== The ACL was one of the local small-school county leagues in Southwest Ohio.

The league had eight schools for most of its history, but consolidation chipped away at its membership total.

All schools in this conference were eventually members of the TVC by either joining after leaving the Mid-Ohio Valley Conference or by consolidating into a school that eventually joined.
