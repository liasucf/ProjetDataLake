He took power in the aftermath of the 2014 Burkinab\u00e9 uprising, sidelining a more senior officer, Honor\u00e9 Nab\u00e9r\u00e9 Traor\u00e9. A few weeks later, a civilian, Michel Kafando, was chosen to replace Zida as transitional head of state; Kafando then appointed Zida as Prime Minister on 19 November 2014. Zida was briefly removed from office by the Regiment of Presidential Security in a September 2015 coup, but he was restored as Prime Minister within a week. ==Early career== Zida obtained a master's degree in International Management from the University of Lyon. He also received military training from the American army.Burkina Faso: Not so pretty now, economist.com. Under President Blaise Compaor\u00e9, he served as deputy commander of the Regiment of Presidential Security. He was a UN peacekeeper in Democratic Republic of the Congo from 2008 to 2009. ==2014 Burkinab\u00e9 uprising== Kossyam palace, where Zida aligned himself with the protesters During the 2014 Burkinab\u00e9 uprising, President Compaor\u00e9 resigned on 31 October 2014 and army chief Honor\u00e9 Nab\u00e9r\u00e9 Traor\u00e9 announced that he was taking over as head of state, but his claim to power was immediately contested by a group of junior officers headed by Zida, who aligned himself with the protesters. On 1 November 2014, the armed forces unanimously backed Zida to lead the country in an interim capacity towards the 2015 presidential election. On 17 November 2014, a civilian, Michel Kafando, was chosen to replace Zida as transitional head of state, and he was sworn in on 18 November.\"Kafando sworn in as Burkina Faso transitional president\", Reuters, 18 November 2014.

In November 2015, near the end of the transitional period, Zida was promoted from the rank of lieutenant-colonel to g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de division in line with a law passed during the transition that provided for promotions to be granted \"for services rendered to the nation\".\"Zida nomm\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Division\", Burkina24, 27 November 2016 .

He was due to return in February, but he failed to do so despite orders from Kabor\u00e9. In December 2016, Kabor\u00e9 said that Zida would be expelled from the army for desertion.\"Burkina : Yacouba Isaac Zida sera ray\u00e9 de l\u2019arm\u00e9e pour \u00ab d\u00e9sertion \u00bb\", Jeune Afrique, 30 December 2016 . ==References== |- Category:1965 births Category:Burkinab\u00e9 military personnel Category:Burkinab\u00e9 Muslims Category:Heads of state of Burkina Faso Category:Leaders who took power by coup Category:Living people Category:Prime Ministers of Burkina Faso Category:University of Lyon alumni ",
