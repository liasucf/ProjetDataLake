    "text": "Attitude Baptist Church (), officially known as Central Barra Baptist Church () is a Baptist Church originating from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil affiliated with the Brazilian Baptist Convention. Josu\u00e9 Vallandro Jr. is its current Pastor- President leading approximately 13,500 members. ==History== Attitude Baptist Church started as a Community Mission in the neighbourhood of Itanhang\u00e1, Rio de Janeiro by the Southern Baptist International Mission Board missionary Edgar F. Hallock, Jr. Initially the Mission met in a rented room of an University nearby and later at a public school. On June 4, 2000, sponsored by the First Baptist Church in Barra, the Mission was organized as the Central Barra Baptist Church with 32 members. ==Organisation== Attitude Baptist was modeled after the successful experiences of Saddleback, Hillsong and Santar\u00e9m- Paz Churches. Works and experiences of pastors Abe Hubner and Rick Warren serve as main inspiration. The Church is organized in 15 congregations and apprimatelly 1.200 cells, which replicate the general Cell church structure of the Main Church in Barra da Tijuca. According to this model the basic structure is the Cell group, which generally has up to 12 people and often cell-members also have the role of counselor and counselee. Upon exceeding this 12-person limit, the cell multiplies into new cells. Each cell is under the care of a Cell-leader. Every cell is integrated into a network of cells under the care of a Cell-supervisor, to whom Cell-leaders report. Cell supervisors in turn report to the pastor of the church, who in turn report to the Pastor-president. Because of its size, the main Church has more hierarchical levels. The work of each church is conducted voluntarily by church members and it is organized into Ministries. Ministries are: * for Children; * for Adolescents; * for Youth; * for Women; * for Men; * for Brazilian Sign Language interpretation. * devoted to the Community in general; * for Biblical and Theological Education; * for Outreach. There are also supporting ministries such as Counseling, Reception, Intercession, Worship and Broadcasting. ==Congregations and Leadership== Since September 27, 2003 the Church is led by its pastor-president, Josu\u00e9 Valandro de Oliveira Jr., and each of its daughter-churches is led by a pastor. The Church meets regularly in 13 congregations in 4 different Brazilian States, 1 in the United States and 1 in Canada.
