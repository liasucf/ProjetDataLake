Additionally, he was specifically assigned to the House Ethics and Administration and Accounts. ====Flooding Cairo controversy==== In April 2011, Speaker Tilley received national media attention for controversial remarks he made about Cairo, Illinois, a poor town on the Illinois side of the Mississippi River. Due to heavy rainfall and high water levels on the river, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was considering a plan to destroy a levee on the Missouri side of the river in hopes of lowering the flood level and preventing severe flood damage to Cairo and other downstream areas. Destroying the levee would have flooded several hundred thousand acres of Missouri farmland. When reporters asked if he would rather see Missouri farmland flooded or the town of Cairo, Tilley responded \"Cairo. I've been there. Trust me. Cairo.\" And further said \"Have you been to Cairo? OK, then you known what I'm saying.\" Tilley later issued an apology: > I was asked a question about blowing up a dam in Missouri and the negative > consequences that happened to Missouri. As the Speaker of the House, (I > believe) my first responsibility is to Missourians. And in my effort to > defend them, I went on to say some pretty insensitive and inappropriate > remarks about Cairo When later interviewed by a Missouri television station, Tilley said the accusations that he was a racist are ridiculous and that when one does as many interviews as he does, one is bound to say something stupid. The Corps of Engineers destroyed the levee on May 3, 2011, flooding 130,000 acres of Missouri farmland but saving the town of Cairo from flooding. == Electoral history == ==References== ==External links== *Steven Tilley's Official House Site Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:People from Perryville, Missouri Category:Southeast Missouri State University alumni Category:University of Missouri\u2013St. Louis alumni Category:American optometrists Category:Missouri Republicans Category:Members of the Missouri House of Representatives Category:Speakers of the Missouri House of Representatives Category:People from Wiesbaden ",
