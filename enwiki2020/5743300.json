    "text": "Melvin Gaels GFC is a Gaelic Athletic Association gaelic football Club in Kinlough, County Leitrim, Ireland. The club was formed on 19 November 1954. Situated in North Leitrim it is bordered by three Counties: Donegal, Fermanagh and Sligo. The club is named after Lough Melvin, the world famous fresh-water lake. The club is based in the village of Kinlough and draws its members from the parish of Kinlough/Glenade and part of the parish of Ballaghmeehan. Contained within the four areas are Tullaghan, Askill, Rossinver, Glenaniff and Ballintrillick. Although Ballintrillick is in County Sligo, it is half the parish of Glenade and over the years it has provided many members for Melvin Gaels. There are two adult Melvin Gaels teams. The senior team last won a Leitrim Senior Football Championship in 2012 and has won the senior title a total of seven times. A reserve team was established in the mid-1990s and has won the Junior League three times (1999, 2003, 2011) and a Championship twice (2004, 2011) since its formation. The club colours are blue and white on the request of the late Rev. J. Dolan P.P one of the founding members of the Club and native of County Cavan. During its history, like many clubs in the rest of Ireland, emigration and unemployment has had a huge impact on Melvin Gaels. From its beginning in 1954 right up until the present day, Melvin Gaels had to endure and try to survive in the process. ==Honours== As of 8 Oct 2012. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"1\"|Competition !rowspan=\"1\"|Quantity !rowspan=\"1\"|Years |- |align=left|Leitrim Senior Football Championship |7 |align=left|1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1965, 1998, 2012 |- |align=left|Leitrim Intermediate Football Championship |4 |align=left|1971, 1992, 2011, 2015 |- |align=left|Leitrim Junior Football Championship |2 |align=left|1955, 2011 |- |align=left|Leitrim Junior B Football Championship |1 |align=left|2004, |- |align=left|North Leitrim Football Championship |2 |align=left|1955, 1960 |- |align=left|Leitrim Under 21 A Football Championship |1 |align=left|2009 |- |align=left|Leitrim Under 21 B Football Championship |3 |align=left|2003, 2004, 2005 |- |align=left|Leitrim Minor Football Championship |1 |align=left|2005 |- |align=left|Leitrim Under 16 Football League |1 |align=left|2006 |- |align=left|Leitrim Under 16 Football Championship (Rural) |1 |align=left|1989 |- |align=left|Leitrim Under 14 Football Championship (Rural) |1 |align=left|1984 |- |align=left|Leitrim Under 12 Football Championship (Rural) |3 |align=left|1984, 1985, 1998 |- |align=left|Leitrim Senior Football League Div 1 |7 |align=left|1958, 1959, 1961, 1962, 1965, 1966, 2008 |- |align=left|Leitrim Senior Football Shield |1 |align=left|2007 |- |align=left|Leitrim Senior Football League Div 2 |1 |align=left|1992 |- |align=left|Leitrim Junior Football League |5 |align=left|1979, 1988, 1999, 2003, 2011 (Div 4) |- |align=left|North Leitrim Football League (Lundon Cup) |1 |align=left|1936 |- |align=left|Leitrim Minor Football League (Rural) | 2 |align=left|1990, 1991 |- |align=left|Leitrim Under 16 Football League Div 2 | 2 |align=left|1992, 2005 |- |align=left|Leitrim Under 12 Football League Div 2 | 1 |align=left|1999 |- |align=left|Leitrim Under 12 Football League Div 3 | 1 |align=left|1996 |} ==External links== *Melvin Gaels CLG Website *Melvin Gaels Facebook Page Category:Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in County Leitrim Category:Gaelic football clubs in County Leitrim ",
