In 1970, through her friendship with \"Las madres del cordero\", she joined the independent theater group T\u00e1bano', during the performances of Casta\u00f1uela 70 at the Teatro de la Comedia in Madrid. That same year she settled in Paris, receiving influences of folk music from areas as disparate as the Maghreb, Turkey or India. Her first LP, Quejido, was released in 1972, with a production by Paco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, who had known her when she heard her sing in the Parisian caf\u00e9 La Contrescarpe. Back in Spain, in 1973, she was arrested for subversion and upon her release from prison she was banned from offering concerts and recitals. Her first album could not be published in the Spanish market until two years later, under the title of Este tiempo ha de acabar (This time has to end) and the songs Esta gente qu\u00e9 querr\u00e1 (These people will want) and Los reyes de la baraja (The kings of the deck) were censored.
