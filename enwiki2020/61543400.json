Villages in the community include: Ahaba and Nchar. ==Women's War== An incident at Oloko started the Women's War in 1929. This arose from fears that a new taxation scheme would impose taxes on women, particularly widows, which they had no previously been expected to pay. When the widow Nwanyereuwa was approached by a tax inspector she immediately refused to co-operate, and went into Oloko Town, where a women's meeting was in progress discussing the issue. The meeting then started to mobilise resistance to the new taxes. Three women active in this campaign, Ikonnia, Nwannedia and Nwugo, became known as the Okolo trio.Oriji, John N. (2000).
