    "text": "Morgan Sparks (July 6, 1916 \u2013 May 3, 2008) was an American scientist and engineer who helped develop the microwatt bipolar junction transistor in 1951, which was a critical step in making transistors usable for every-day electronics. Sparks directed Sandia National Laboratories. ==Early life and education== Sparks was born in Pagosa Springs, Colorado and earned his BA and MA degrees, both in chemistry, at Rice University. He then did his PhD work in physical chemistry at the University of Illinois, Urbana. ==Career== Sparks went on to work at Bell Labs where John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and William Shockley were developing the first transistor. Sparks stayed at Bell Labs and worked there to develop the microwatt bipolar junction transistor which helped make transistors practical enough for common use. Later, Sparks left Bell Labs to become the director of Sandia National Laboratories. ==See also== * History of the transistor ==References== ==External links== * Obituary: NY Times * Obituary: Times Category:1916 births Category:2008 deaths Category:People from Pagosa Springs, Colorado Category:Rice University alumni Category:University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign alumni Category:United States Department of Energy National Laboratories personnel Category:20th-century American engineers Category:Scientists at Bell Labs Category:Sandia National Laboratories people ",
