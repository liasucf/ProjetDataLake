    "text": "In fluid dynamics, the Buckley\u2013Leverett equation is a conservation equation used to model two-phase flow in porous media. The Buckley\u2013Leverett equation or the Buckley\u2013Leverett displacement describes an immiscible displacement process, such as the displacement of oil by water, in a one-dimensional or quasi-one-dimensional reservoir. This equation can be derived from the mass conservation equations of two-phase flow, under the assumptions listed below. ==Equation== In a quasi-1D domain, the Buckley\u2013Leverett equation is given by: : \\frac{\\partial S_w}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left( \\frac{Q}{\\phi A} f_w(S_w) \\right) = \\phi\\frac{\\partial S_w}{\\partial x}, where S_w(x,t) is the wetting-phase (water) saturation, Q is the total flow rate, \\phi is the rock porosity, A is the area of the cross-section in the sample volume, and f_w(S_w) is the fractional flow function of the wetting phase. Typically, f_w(S_w) is an 'S'-shaped, nonlinear function of the saturation S_w, which characterizes the relative mobilities of the two phases: : f_w(S_w) = \\frac{\\lambda_w}{\\lambda_w + \\lambda_n} = \\frac{ \\frac{k_{rw}}{\\mu_w} }{ \\frac{k_{rw}}{\\mu_w} + \\frac{k_{rn}}{\\mu_n} }, where \\lambda_w and \\lambda_n denote the wetting and non-wetting phase mobilities. k_{rw}(S_w) and k_{rn}(S_w) denote the relative permeability functions of each phase and \\mu_w and \\mu_n represent the phase viscosities. ==Assumptions== The Buckley\u2013Leverett equation is derived based on the following assumptions: * Flow is linear and horizontal * Both wetting and non-wetting phases are incompressible * Immiscible phases * Negligible capillary pressure effects (this implies that the pressures of the two phases are equal) * Negligible gravitational forces ==General solution== The characteristic velocity of the Buckley-Leverett equation is given by: :U(S_w) = \\frac{Q}{\\phi A} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} f_w}{\\mathrm{d} S_w}. The hyperbolic nature of the equation implies that the solution of the Buckley-Leverett equation has the form S_w(x,t) = S_w(x - U t), where U is the characteristic velocity given above. The non-convexity of the fractional flow function f_w(S_w) also gives rise to the well known Buckley-Leverett profile, which consists of a shock wave immediately followed by a rarefaction wave. ==See also== * Capillary pressure * Permeability (fluid) * Relative permeability * Darcy's law ==References== ==External links== * Buckley-Leverett Equation and Uses in Porous Media Category:Conservation equations Category:Equations of fluid dynamics ",
