    "text": "Gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA+) is an analytical process used by several Federal government departments to assess the different experiences of women, men and non-binary people to policies, programs and initiatives. The 'Plus' considers the intersectionality of many other identity factors (like race, ethnicity, religion, age, and mental or ability) which comprise our identity. The GBA+ process goes through a number of analytical steps: ==History== GBA+ can be used to assess the impact on citizens such as addressing how procurement projects can help to ensure that equipment and products meet diverse needs. It can also be used to review hiring strategies to see that they are implemented to ensure workplace diversity. An internal survey of Government of Canada departments found that \"fewer than half of departments and agencies have a GBA+ plan, with most departments saying they lack the internal mechanisms to apply one.\" Canada's GBA initiative was started following commitments by the Government of Canada at the World Conference on Women, 1995 in Beijing. During the 2018 G20 Buenos Aires summit in Argentina Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, \u201cWell, you know, there are gender impacts when you bring construction workers into a rural area. There are social impacts because they\u2019re mostly male construction workers. How are you adjusting and adapting to those? That\u2019s what the gender lens in GBA (gender- based analysis)-plus budgeting is all about.\u201d The Department of National Defence is using GBA+ to be ensure that they are removing bias from procurement of a range of products from uniforms to Aircraft.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police leveraged GBA+ to develop tools to for greater cultural competency and better response to gender-based violence (GBV) when training their staff. Minister Carla Qualtrough has said that \u201cin all of our procurements, military and otherwise, we are looking at ways to ensure opportunities for businesses owned or led by Canadians from under-represented groups, such as women, Indigenous peoples, and persons with disabilities.\u201d and the GBA+ framework is an important to achieve this. ==References== Category:Human rights in Canada Category:Gender in Canada Category:Intersectionality ",
