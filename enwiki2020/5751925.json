    "text": "4-Aminophenol (or para-aminophenol or p-aminophenol) is the organic compound with the formula H2NC6H4OH. Typically available as a white powder,CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 65th Ed. it was commonly used as a developer for black-and-white film, marketed under the name Rodinal. Reflecting its slightly hydrophilic character, the white powder is moderately soluble in alcohols and can be recrystallized from hot water. In the presence of a base, it oxidizes readily. The methylated derivatives N-methylaminophenol and N,N-dimethylaminophenol are of commercial value. The compound is one of three isomeric aminophenols, the other two being 2-aminophenol and 3-aminophenol. __TOC__ == Preparation == === From phenol === It is produced from phenol by nitration followed by reduction with iron. Alternatively, the partial hydrogenation of nitrobenzene affords phenylhydroxylamine, which rearranges primarily to 4-aminophenol:Mitchell, S.C. & Waring, R.H. \"Aminophenols.\" In Ullmann\u2019s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry; 2002 Wiley-VCH, :C6H5NO2 \\+ 2 H2 \u2192 C6H5NHOH + H2O :C6H5NHOH \u2192 HOC6H4NH2 === From nitrobenzene === It can be produced from nitrobenzene by electrolytic conversion to phenylhydroxylamine, which spontaneously rearranges to 4-aminophenol. ==Uses== 4-Aminophenol is a building block used in organic chemistry. Prominently, it is the final intermediate in the industrial synthesis of paracetamol. Treating 4-aminophenol with acetic anhydride gives paracetamol: :alt= == References == Category:Phenols Category:Anilines ",
