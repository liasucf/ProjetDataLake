    "text": "Alexandre Bandzeladze () was a Georgian artist. Alexandre Bandzeladze's family, after having been exiled to the Irkutsk District during the repressions in the 1920s, returned to Tbilisi in 1932. In 1947, he enrolled in the Oil Painting Department of the Tbilisi Academy of Fine Arts under the tutorship of Sergo Kobuladze, Iosif Charlemagne, and Valentin Sherpilov. Expelled from the academy in 1949, he received his diploma as late as 1963, with the help of Apolon Kutateladze. At that time, Bandzeladze actively collaborated with the editorial teams of various Georgian magazines. He authored milestone works for the development of Georgian book graphic design, such as Arsenas Leksi (Arsena's Poem) (1957) and Rudyard Kipling's Mowgli (1960). In 1978\u20131988, he painted the murals at the Church of the Dormition of the Mother of God in . In the 1950s, Alexandre Bandzeladze led an innovative movement in Georgia and the Soviet Union in general and pioneered the process of rejuvenating the language of visual arts. During his creative quest, and as a result of taking in the traditions of modernist European oil painting, he developed his own artistic system characterized by striking individualism. After Davit Kakabadze, Alexandre Bandzeladze was one of the first to have returned abstract art into Georgia's artistic context. Alexandre Bandzeladze's works have had an enormous impact on the development of contemporary Georgian visual arts and on nourishing interest in arts among younger generations. == Exhibitions == Solo exhibitions *1991 \"Dissident \u201c, Sevikli, Pennsylvania, USA *1991 Georgian Abstractions, Nicholas Rerikh Museum, New York - New York, USA *1990 \"Where am I...?\", Amsterdam, Netherlands *1989 Sevikli, Pennsylvania, USA *1988 Basel, Brussels, Belgium *1968 Opava, Czech Republic Group Exhibitions *2000 - N Gallery, Tbilisi, Georgia *1992 - Mapini Art - Gallery, Sheffield, England *1991 - \"Georgian Abstraction\", \"international image\" Gallery, Pittsburgh, USA *1990 - \"In the expression of watercolor,\" Tbilisi, Georgia *1990 - Four Design from Tbilisi, prideritsianis Museum, Kassel exhibition of abstract art.
