    "text": "William Henry Margetson (December 18612 January 1940) was an English painter and illustrator, mainly known for his aesthetic portraits of women. == Life and work == Margetson was born at Camberwell in Surrey. He studied at Dulwich College, and later at the Royal College of Art and the Royal Academy of Arts. In 1885 he first exhibited at the Royal Academy, and later also at the Royal Society of British Artists, the Royal Institute of Oil Painters and the Grosvenor Gallery. Margetson painted in oils and watercolours. He made his name with portraits of beautiful women, often with modern hairstyles and hats. He also created religious and allegorical artworks. To begin with he worked in an academic, Victorian style. Later he would use a looser brushstyle inspired by the post-impressionists and the pre-raphaelites, and in particular Lawrence Alma-Tadema. His most successful work was the classically decorative The Sea Hath its Pearls which he exhibited in 1897 at the Royal Academy, now in the possession of the Art Gallery of New South Wales, in Australia. A portrait of Alfred Tennyson by Margetson is in the National Portrait Gallery in London. Margetson also worked as an illustrator of books. He was married to the artist Helen Hatton, who he met when they worked on an illustration project together. He lived and worked first in London and later in Blewbury and Wallingford. He died in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, in 1940, at the age of 78. == Gallery == File:The Sea Hath its Pearls 1897 - William Henry Margetson.jpg|The Sea Hath its Pearls File:William Henry Margetson The Seashore 1900.jpg|The seashore File:William Henry Margetson A summer evening.jpg|A Summer Evening File:Poseidon's mistress on the shore.jpg|Poseidon's mistress on the shore File:Margetson William Henry At The Cottage Door.jpg|At The Cottage Door File:William henry margetson a new day.jpg|A New Day File:William Henry Margetson A stitch in time 1915.jpg|A Stitch in Time File:William Henry Margetson Girl by a Lock.jpg|Girl by a Lock File:Cinderella and the Fairy Godmother.jpg|Cinderella and the Fairy Godmother File:Margetson faith.jpg|Faith File:William Henry Margetson The Amulet.Jpeg|The Amulet File:Williamhenry-margetson nora.jpg|Nora File:Margetson tennyson.jpg|Alfred Lord Tennyson File:Helen hatton.jpg|Helen Hatton File:She was known to have studied magic while she was being brought up in the nunnery.png|Morgan le Fay from Margetson's illustrations for The Legends of King Arthur and His Knights (1908) ==External links== * Margetson on Artists and Art * * Short biography * Category:1860 births Category:1940 deaths Category:19th-century British painters Category:20th-century British painters Category:Alumni of the Royal Academy Schools Category:Alumni of the Royal College of Art Category:Artists from London Category:English painters Category:Academic art Category:British illustrators Category:British male painters Category:People educated at Dulwich College Category:People of the Victorian era Category:People from Camberwell Category:People from Blewbury Category:Children's book illustrators Category:Members of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours ",
