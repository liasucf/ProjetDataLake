    "text": "This is a list of Barbie's friends and family. 250px == Barbie's family and other principal characters == * Barbara Millicent \"Barbie\" Roberts (1959\u2013present) Described as a \"Teen Age Fashion Model\" on the original packaging. According to the Random House books, the character's full name is Barbara Millicent Roberts. *George Roberts (1960\u2013present) He has a wife named Margaret and children: Barbara, Skipper, Stacie, Todd, Tutti, Chelsea, Kelly, and Kristine. Originally just a book character, he has not been issued in doll form but has appeared for the first time in animation as Barbie's father in the digital series Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures. He was originally described as an engineer, but his job was changed to documentary filmmaker in Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures. *Margaret Rawlins Roberts (1960\u2013present) Margaret is the wife of George Roberts and the mother of Barbie and her various siblings. Also originally a book character, she has not been issued in doll form, however, she made her first on-screen appearance in Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures. She was initially a homemaker, but in Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures, she is a computer engineer and the designer of the Roberts family dreamhouse. She has a sister named Millicent. * Kenneth Sean \"Ken\" Carson (1961\u20131967, 1969\u2013present) The second character added to the line, Ken has been Barbie's boyfriend for much of the character's existence. After a short break, they got back together. According to the 1960s Random House books, Ken's full name is Kenneth Sean Carson. In Barbie Fashion Comic #34 (1993), Ken's mother is named Edna. In Barbie Fashion Comic #51 (1995), Edna's father is named Kenneth, hinting at the fact he was most likely named after him. In Brazil in the 1980s, the Estrela company named the doll Bob instead of Ken (from the book, Barbie Doll Around the World). In Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures, he is one of Barbie's best friends and next-door neighbor. * Skipper Roberts (1964\u20132003, 2009\u2013present) The first character added to Barbie's family, Skipper is Barbie's younger sister, originally seeming the age of ten when she debuted from now ranging at different teenage ages through the years. She was first introduced with blue eyes and a variety of hair colors like blonde, brown, and titian. Starting in 1996 Skipper was re-branded as Barbie's 'teen' sister, with her looking much older than before and raising her height to almost the same as Barbie's. After not being made since 2003, Skipper came back in 2009 as part of Barbie's 2009 camping line. She returned to her height before she was 'teen' Skipper but this time with a purple streak in her hair. In 2010 Barbie's sisters got revamped once again, this time Skipper was given brown hair and colored streaks in her hair (sometimes purple, blue, or pink), and she was given a new head mold and body. She was one of the main characters in the Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse series and now stars along with Barbie in Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures. * Tutti and Todd (Tutti: 1965\u20131971, Todd: 1965-1996) Twins, both Tutti and Todd were younger siblings of Barbie and Skipper, and had seamless 'bendy' bodies. Tutti's packaging did not mention Todd, but many sets were made for both. The two were only sold together in one set. They debuted in 1966 and were available in the US until 1971; remaining on the European market until 1980. The Tutti doll was also available in Mexico from 1968 to 1970 through Lili Ledy in agreements with Mattel. They appeared to be small school children and had bendable bodies. On Todd's box it said, \"twin of stacie\" though on Stacie's box she didn't give a reference to Todd. Tutti had a friend named Chris. Additionally, a \"Buffy\" version (with miniature Mrs. Beasley doll), after the '60s/'70s television sitcom Family Affair, was marketed due to the show's popularity. Todd was reintroduced in 1991 as part of the wedding party for Barbie's best friend Midge Hadley. The new Todd had a new head mold with a copyright date of 1990. This new Todd was dressed in a tuxedo and packaged in a large giftset of six dolls that included Midge as the bride, Alan as the groom, Barbie as the maid of honor, Ken as the best man, Todd as the ring bearer, and a doll named Kelly as the flower girl. Todd and Kelly as ring bearer and flower girl were also packaged together as a pair. This Kelly doll, not to be confused with today's toddler Kelly from the Barbie line, was the same size/age as Todd. Indeed, she was made with exactly the same body and head molds. The next year, the Todd-sized Kelly doll was replaced by Stacie Roberts, who had a brand new head mold with a cheerful smile. Tutti was not reintroduced; Stacie is believed to be a modern incarnation of Tutti. Mattel produced several more of the new Todd dolls over the next few years, some in both white and African-American versions. But Todd was dropped from the Barbie line and was not brought back with Stacie when she reappeared in the Wee 3 Friends series. The latest version of Todd is the 2008 Todd and Stacie Mary Poppins boxed set, with a comment on the back that \"Todd and Stacie are dressed as Michael and Jane from Disney's Mary Poppins\". * Stacie Roberts (1990\u2013present) Introduced as Kelly in the 1990 Wedding Day Midge gift set as the flower girl, this doll is often confused with Tutti, though the Tutti character had been discontinued for years at this time. Kelly was renamed and introduced as Stacie shortly thereafter in 1992, and the Kelly name was used for a younger character. Todd then became the twin brother of Stacie until he was discontinued in 1996. * Francie Fairchild (1966\u20131977) Marketed as \"Barbie's Modern Cousin,\" Francie paved the way for Barbie's transition into the MOD era. Francie appeared to be only slightly younger than Barbie, and had a straight, streamlined figure. The Francie doll was the first to feature rooted eyelashes. In the March 1966 issue of Barbie Magazine, she is the daughter of Claude and Lily Fairchild. * Jazzie (1988\u20131992) Another cousin of Barbie and part of a small group of high school age dolls. She was taller than Barbie's other cousin Francie, with Jazzie being almost the same height as Barbie. * Kelly/Shelly Roberts (1995\u20132010) This character is of toddler age, and is a sister to Barbie. Originally the baby of the family, Kelly seemed to be older in the 2000s with Krissy now being the 'baby' sister. Kelly starred in most of Barbie's computer animated films, up until Barbie in a Christmas Carol as her last film appearance. In Europe, she is known as Shelly. Kelly dolls ceased production in late 2010 and were replaced by Chelsea. Excluding a brief period when the design of the Kelly doll was changed to have an oval-shaped head, larger eyes, and longer limbs, Kelly dolls have stayed true to their original design. A doll named Kelly was introduced in 1992 as part of the Midge and Allan Wedding Day Set, this Kelly doll is 7 1/2 inches tall, exactly the same size as the ring bearer, Todd, who is wearing a Tuxedo. She wore a peach dotted Swiss dress and carries a white basket of flowers as she is the flower girl. This \"Kelly\" was later renamed and \u201cturned into\u201d the Stacie doll. The Todd doll which is made from the same mold has fuzzy brown hair. \"Kelly\" is mentioned in the web series, Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse when Raquelle refers to Chelsea as Kelly instead, referencing the confusion involving whether Kelly or Chelsea is Barbie's younger sister. * Chelsea Roberts, (2010\u2013Present) Barbie's younger sister. She replaced Kelly after 2010. She appears to be approximately 5\u20136 years old and is slightly taller than Kelly. The doll was first produced in 2011 as part of the \"My Fab Sisters\" line. She is the youngest sister of Barbie currently sold (Mattel discontinued Kelly shortly before Chelsea was produced). She has blonde hair and blue eyes (very similar to Kelly). Mattel has also made African American versions of Chelsea. She was a main character in the Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse series and now appears in Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures and her own series Barbie: Dreamtopia. * Kristine \"Krissy\" Roberts (1998\u20132001) This character is an infant, and was Barbie's youngest sibling to date. * Blaine Gordon (2004) Barbie's Australian ex-boyfriend, whom she dated during her much-publicized \"breakup\" with the Ken character. Blaine is said to be the brother of Summer, one of Barbie's friends. Blaine does not show in any of the Barbie series but was originally a character from Generation Girls and showed interest in Ana. * Millicent Rawlins is Barbie's aunt and Margaret's sister. Her first appearance was in Barbie: A Fashion Fairytale. * Lillian Roberts Fairchild is Francie's mother, Barbie's aunt, George's sister and Margaret's sister-in-law. * Claude Fairchild is Francie's father, Barbie's uncle and Margaret and George's brother-in-law. * Marlene Roberts is Barbie's aunt, George's sister and Margaret's sister-in-law. * Grandmother Rawlins is Barbie's grandmother and Margaret Roberts' mother. She passed her love of reading onto Barbie. She is encouraging and supportive of her granddaughter. She gave Barbie a book to read that Barbie related to. Her first appearance is in Barbie and the Secret Door as Alexa's grandmother. Note: Alexa is Barbie's Role in Barbie and the Secret Door. She also appears in The Great Puppy Adventure as herself. * Max and Marie Roberts are the twin children of Marlene Roberts, cousins of Barbie and her siblings, and niece and nephew of Margaret Roberts and George Roberts. They showed up in Barbie and Her Sisters in A Pony Tale. * Kristen Rawlins is a cousin of Barbie, appearing in the picture book, The Wedding Party. * Adele (2019\u2013Present) Barbie's aunt and the owner of the Windy Willows Inn in Barbie's hometown, Willows, Wisconsin. She first appeared in season 3, episode 3 of Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures, The Ballad of Windy Willows. Her most recent appearance was in season 5, episode 7 of Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures, The Curse of the Miner's Ghost. Her design is very similar to Margaret's, suggesting that she is Margaret's sister. == Female Barbie-sized friends == * Midge Hadley Sherwood (1963\u20131966, 1988\u20132004, 2013\u20132015) This character was Barbie's best friend according to promotional materials and packaging. She was the third character introduced to the Barbie line, following Barbie and Ken. In the Random House novels, her last name is Hadley. She was paired with Allan Sherwood, Ken's best friend, when Allan was introduced in 1964. After she married Allan/Alan in 1991, she became Midge Hadley Sherwood. In the 1990s Price Stern Sloan series Adventures with Barbie, she and Alan are married, and in book 5, The Phantom of Shrinking Pond, by Suzanne Weyn, copyright 1992, it's implied that she is named after her Aunt Margaret (not the same person as Margaret Roberts). She is named Viky in Brazil (from the book Barbie Doll Around the World, by J. Michael Augustyniak, copyright 2008 Collector Books). In 2001 she was given her own line named Happy Family. Midge was released with a magnetic belly and a baby. Also in the line was Alan and their son Ryan, and Midge's parents though they were never given real names. In 2013, she was brought back in the \"Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse\" web series. In the series, she undergoes a makeover to look more modern, though the character tends to act like she is still in the 1960s. There is no mention of Allan/Alan in the series. Since 2015 Midge has not appeared in doll form or in any of Barbie's movie/shows. * Christie (1968\u20132005, 2015) Barbie doll's first African-American friend character, Christie was part of the new group of Talking dolls for 1968. Christie was later issued as a Twist 'N Turn version. The character appeared in the product line continuously for many years, though the original Christie face sculpt was discontinued in 1978. Christie is notable in that she has been romantically linked with several male characters over the years. In 1970, she was linked with Brad, the Talking Brad doll even said \"Christie is the greatest\". In 1982, the Sunsational Malibu Christie doll had a boyfriend named Ken who used the Brad face sculpt with rooted hair. In the late 80s, Christie was paired with Steven. The surname O'Neil is associated with the Nikki character, who is purported to be Christie's sister, but the surname has not been associated directly with Christie. The doll has been criticized as following American beauty standards instead of representing African cultural body image, representing only one tone of skin color, and because her sculpted features were seen to symbolize white standards of beauty. Christie was discontinued when Barbie got Nikki as her new African-American friend, though Nikki uses Christie's face for a little, the change in name of almost the same doll was never stated. In the 2015 Barbie movie Barbie and her Sister in a Puppy Rescue, Christie is the name of one of Barbie's old friends from Willows, Wisconsin. On the back of the 1999 Beyond Pink Christie box, her birthday is listed as August 9. * Teresa (1988\u2013present) Originally used the 1983 Spanish Barbie face sculpt for the Island Fun Teresa doll and the Beach Blast Teresa doll. Starting with the Wet 'N Wild Teresa doll, the character began using the 1972 Steffie face sculpt. Beginning with the Rollerblade Teresa doll, the character began using an all-new face sculpt that has become known as the Teresa face sculpt. In the Grolier book High Sea Adventure from 1999, her last name is Rivera. Teresa is of Hispanic heritage. She is named Debora in Brazil (from the book Barbie Doll Around the World, by J. Michael Augustyniak, copyright 2008 Collector Books). She was featured in the 2008 film as Barbie's best friend, where she told a story about her and Barbie (as Liana and Alexa) as two girls closer than most friends living in the forest. She appeared in the web series Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse and now stars in Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures as one of Barbie's best friends. She also starred in the 2016 movie, Barbie: Spy Squad alongside Barbie and Renee. On the back of the 1999 Beyond Pink Teresa box, her birthday is listed as Oct. 2. * Summer Gordon (2004\u20132015) This doll used an all-new face sculpt. Summer is Blaine's little sister with strawberry blonde hair and had green/brown eyes. She was a frequent character in the web series Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse. She was originally from Australia when she was first introduced in 2004. * Nicole \"Nikki\" O'Neil/Watkins (2006\u2013present) This doll appears as one of Barbie's current friends, and is closer to her, Barbie is often seen hanging out with just Teresa and Nikki. She has used multiple different head sculpts through the years. Her last name is O'Neil in the 2010 Random House book, \"Barbie: I Can be a Movie Star,\" but her last name was established as Watkins in Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures. Nikki is Christie's little sister. She was introduced in 1997 as part of the \"Teen Skipper\" line. She was a frequent character in the web series Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse and now stars in Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures as one of Barbie's best friends. * Raquelle (2007\u20132015) This doll used the Summer face sculpt with her original debut. In 2011, she appeared with an all-new face sculpt in the Barbie Fashionistas line. She is Barbie's frenemy as shown in Barbie: A Fairy Secret and the web series Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse, and has a twin brother named Ryan. * Grace (2009\u20132015) This doll made its first appearance in the 2009 SIS Line, she used to be a friend of Barbie who moves to Chicago and makes new Friends. She also appears in Barbie: A Fashion Fairytale. In 2014 she moved back to Malibu. Her backstory was rebooted when she started appearing in Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse. She is very smart and interested in science. ==Barbie's friends== Left: Walk Lively Steffie, from 1972. Right: Free Moving PJ, from 1974. The Steffie face sculpt was used for decades, for several different Barbie-related Mattel dolls. Her eye colour, hairstyle and hair colour changed as well. * Stacey (1968\u20131971) Introduced as \"Barbie's British chum\" during the musical British Invasion of the US, Stacey first appeared with long hair, either blonde, brunette, or redhead, tied in a side ponytail. A second edition had much shorter hair, styled in a curly flip. It is the Stacey face sculpt that is used for Malibu Barbie. * PJ (1969\u20131983) Fully representing the \"groovy\", \"hippie\" era of the late 1960s, PJ originally appeared using Midge's face sculpt, but with much longer hair, tied into beaded pigtails. In 1972, with PJ's addition to the Malibu Barbie line (consisting at that time of Barbie, Ken, Skipper, and Francie), she changed to the Steffie face sculpt, which continued until the end of her production. She was billed as Barbie's best friend, again replacing Midge. One of the final iterations of the doll, \"Dream Date PJ\", erroneously lists her as Barbie's cousin. It is the only such reference, and should not be considered canon. * Steffie (1972) Although only three versions of Steffie were produced, all of which appeared in 1972, her face sculpt was used for several Barbie-family dolls for decades after, primarily the PJ doll. Some Barbies of that era, issued outside the US, use the Steffie face sculpt. In at least one Mattel advertisement from 1972, Busy Steffie is pictured, but is referred to as \"Busy PJ\", indicating that, even though Barbie fans refer to her as having the Steffie face sculpt, it is actually Steffie that has the PJ face sculpt. However, because PJ had used the Midge face sculpt for three years prior, Steffie was the first Mattel doll to use it as her only face sculpt, hence the name \"Steffie face\". * Whitney (1986-1991) Described on her debut as \u201cBarbie doll\u2019s glamorous best friend\u201d in the Jewel Secrets Barbie line of 1986 ( Princess Laura in Europe ). This doll uses the Steffie face mold and always featured brunette hair. Returned in 1987 as Nurse Whitney in the Doctor Barbie line, and Perfume Pretty Whitney the same year. Made a return for 1988 in the Style Magic Barbie line. She made her last appearance as European exclusive Ultra Hair Whitney. * Kira/Miko (Marina in Europe) (1985\u20132001) Barbie doll's first Asian friend character, The first appearance was in the line of Tropical Barbie in 1985 as Miko. Kira was later introduced looking similar to Miko and with the same head sculpt. Several other dolls have come out with appearance to Kira and Miko with several names, as Dana in Barbie and the rockers, as Becky in the Barbie and the sensations, as Nikki in the line of Animal Lovin'. The character appeared in the product line continuously for many years, the original Kira/Oriental face sculpt was created in 1980. * Becky (1997-1999) A friend of Barbie who uses a wheelchair. She used the Teen Skipper head mold but there were only three dolls ever made. * Kayla/Lea * Harper (2016-2017) A friend of Barbie who has only appeared in vlogs on Barbie's YouTube channel. She is plus-sized and has blue hair, and Barbie describes her as 'easygoing.' Harper is seen in 3 vlogs, where it is established that her father is in the military so her family has moved a lot, she has a brother, she is left handed and ambidextrous, she is afraid of heights, and she has a pet iguana named Stanley. * Ryan (2017) Ryan is friends with Barbie, Ken, and Harper, and has only appeared in one vlog on Barbie's YouTube channel.

She first appeared in the 2016 movie, Barbie: Spy Squad starring alongside Barbie and Teresa.

She is a DJ and plays the guitar. * Trevelian \"Trey\" Fincknottle Reardon (2018\u2013Present) The Roberts' neighbor and Barbie's frenemy and classmate in Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures. He is the son of Poppy and Whittaker Reardon and is wealthy and privileged, but he struggles to impress his parents. Trey dislikes the Roberts family and often participates in his mother's plans to get rid of them. As the series progresses, Trey grows as a person. He begins to stand up to his parents and becomes more open to helping others. His best friends are Ned and Ted. * Tammy Bounceaway (2018\u2013Present) Barbie's frenemy in Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures. She is a social media influencer and first appears as Barbie's competition on a baking game show, where she cheats in an attempt to win. Later, she transfers to Barbie's school, where she is constantly at odds with Barbie. * Ned and Ted (2018\u2013Present) Fraternal twins and Trey Reardon's best friends in Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures.
