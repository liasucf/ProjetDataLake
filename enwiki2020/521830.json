    "text": "In crystallography, the orthorhombic crystal system is one of the 7 crystal systems. Orthorhombic lattices result from stretching a cubic lattice along two of its orthogonal pairs by two different factors, resulting in a rectangular prism with a rectangular base (a by b) and height (c), such that a, b, and c are distinct. All three bases intersect at 90\u00b0 angles, so the three lattice vectors remain mutually orthogonal. ==Bravais lattices== Rectangular vs rhombic unit cells for the 2D orthorhombic lattices. The swapping of centering type when the unit cell is changed also applies for the 3D orthorhombic lattices === Two-dimensional === In two dimensions there are two orthorhombic Bravais lattices: primitive rectangular and centered rectangular. The primitive rectangular lattice can also be described by a centered rhombic unit cell, while the centered rectangular lattice can also be described by a primitive rhombic unit cell. === Three-dimensional === In three dimensions, there are four orthorhombic Bravais lattices: primitive orthorhombic, base-centered orthorhombic, body-centered orthorhombic, and face-centered orthorhombic. {| class=\"wikitable\" !

In this axis setting, the primitive and base-centered lattices swap in centering type, while the same thing happens with the body-centered and face-centered lattices. Note that the length a in the lower row is not the same as in the upper row, as can be seen in the figure in the section on two-dimensional lattices. For the first and third column above, a of the second row equals \\sqrt{a^2+b^2} of the first row, and for the second and fourth column it equals half of this. ==Crystal classes== The orthorhombic crystal system class names, examples, Sch\u00f6nflies notation, Hermann-Mauguin notation, point groups, International Tables for Crystallography space group number, orbifold notation, type, and space groups are listed in the table below. {| class=wikitable |- ! rowspan=2 width=50| ! colspan=5|Point group ! rowspan=2|Type ! rowspan=2|Example ! colspan=4|Space groups |- !
