Its administrative area corresponds to roughly the modern provinces of Guangxi and Hainan, as well as the western part of Guangdong (Leizhou Peninsula). Guangnan West Circuit and Guangnan East Circuit were split from Guangnan Circuit in 988. After the Yuan dynasty was established, most of the Guangnan West Circuit became part of the much larger Huguang province, whose capital was at Wuchang. == See also == * History of Guangxi * Lingnan culture ==References== * * Category:Circuits of the Song dynasty Category:988 establishments Category:10th-century establishments in China Category:1278 disestablishments in Asia Category:13th-century disestablishments in China ",
