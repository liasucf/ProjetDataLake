He represented the FR Yugoslavia national team at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. ==Club career== ===Budu\u0107nost=== Petrovi\u0107 made his professional debut with Budu\u0107nost in 1987 under coach Stanko Poklepovi\u0107. In Petrovi\u0107's second season at Budu\u0107nost, the team included the likes of Ni\u0161a Savelji\u0107, Anto Drobnjak, Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107, and Predrag Mijatovi\u0107. Worldfootball.net: FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica \u00bb Squad 1988/1989. Accessed 10 September, 2017. During Petrovi\u0107's time at Budu\u0107nost, the team finished in ninth place in the 1987\u201388 season, fourteenth in the 1988\u201389 season, and tenth in the 1989\u201390 season. ===Dinamo Zagreb=== Petrovi\u0107 moved to Dinamo Zagreb in 1990, where he played as a right back. In June 1991, Dinamo changed their name to HA\u0160K Gra\u0111anski. In HA\u0160K Gra\u0111anski's short 1991\u201392 UEFA Cup campaign, Petrovi\u0107 scored all three of HA\u0160K Gra\u0111anski's goals over two legs played against Trabzonspor. He scored two penalties in the first leg played on 17 September 1991, which HA\u0160K lost 2\u20133 to Trabzonspor. UEFA.com History: Dinamo Zagreb 2-3 Trabzonspor. 17 September 1991. Retrieved 10 September 2017 He scored another goal in the second leg played on 2 October 1991, which HA\u0160K tied 1-1. UEFA.com History: Trabzonspor 1-1 Dinamo Zagreb. 2 October 1991. Retrieved 10 September 2017. In spite of Petrovi\u0107's goalscoring form, HA\u0160K were eliminated from the UEFA Cup losing to Trabzonspor on aggregate. ===Sevilla=== Petrovi\u0107 joined Sevilla in November 1991, with his transfer from HA\u0160K Gra\u0111anski costing the Spanish team 500,000 DM. HA\u0160K Gra\u0111anski had agreed on Petrovi\u0107's transfer as part of a package with Davor \u0160uker, who joined Sevilla simultaneously. At the time, La Liga teams could field only up to four foreigners on the pitch, and Sevilla already had two foreign starters in Iv\u00e1n Zamorano and Pablo Bengoechea. With the addition of \u0160uker, Petrovi\u0107 was meant to be Sevilla's fourth foreign starter, although he initially enjoyed little playing time. Gradually, coach V\u00edctor Esp\u00e1rrago began bringing him off the bench, and in a breakthrough performance, Petrovi\u0107 made an assist in Sevilla's 1\u20130 win against Real Murcia in the 1992 Copa del Rey Round of 16. On 22 March 1992, Petrovi\u0107 scored his only goal in a league match with Real Burgos, with Sevilla winning 3\u20132. However, after the departure of coach Esp\u00e1rrago, a markedly dry spell followed, especially when Sevilla signed Diego Maradona in the summer of 1992. Therefore, he was quick to sign for Dutch club FC Den Bosch that summer. ===Den Bosch and Waalwijk=== Petrovi\u0107 joined FC Den Bosch in 1992 while his father was living in nearby Heusden as a guest worker. This circumstance seemed to be a deciding factor in his move to Den Bosch, as it was widely regarded that he could have easily played for a more competitive team. Den Bosch director Chris van der Laar commented that Petrovi\u0107 was \"too good for Den Bosch\". In spite of Petrovi\u0107's good reception, Den Bosch struggled in the 1992\u201393 season and ended up relegated back to the second tier at the end of the season. After a 5\u20130 loss against Feyenoord in May 1993, Den Bosch coach Hans van der Pluijm noted that \"[Petrovi\u0107] is playing three classes better than the rest of the team.\" He was eager to join RKC Waalwijk in 1994. It was at this club which he excelled as an attacking right-back, and he scored 13 goals in total of 2 seasons before joining Dutch giants PSV Eindhoven in 1996. ===PSV=== Petrovi\u0107 joined PSV Eindhoven in the summer of 1996. He was a regular starter during the 1996\u201397 season, when PSV won the Eredivisie that season under coach Dick Advocaat. In his second season at the club, however, he proved a difficult player to manage and he was also involved in a spat with team captain Arthur Numan. Towards the end of Petrovi\u0107's time at PSV, coach Advocaat was critical of his smoking habits. In the fall of 1997, Petrovi\u0107 accepted a lucrative offer from the Urawa Red Diamonds, which estranged him from the rest of the club. He insisted that he did not wish to leave PSV, but that the offer could not be ignored since ten of his relatives were living off of his money in Yugoslavia. Petrovi\u0107 played a total of 35 games for PSV. He played his last game for PSV on 5 November 1997, in a Champions League match against Newcastle United at St James' Park. ===Urawa Red Diamonds=== In 1997, he moved to Japan to play for Urawa Red Diamonds before returning to RKC Waalwijk in 2000 where he finished his playing career. ==International career== Petrovi\u0107 made his debut for the national team of Yugoslavia on 12 September 1990 in a match against Northern Ireland. Yugoslavia was subsequently banned from the Euro 1992, the 1994 FIFA World Cup, and the Euro 1996 due to FIFA suspending Yugoslavia following the international sanctions against Yugoslavia. Petrovi\u0107 would play for Yugoslavia again five years after his debut, for the qualification to the 1998 FIFA World Cup. ===Death threat=== Petrovi\u0107 was a regular of the Yugoslav national team throughout the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification. On 28 October 1997, the night before the first leg of the qualifying play-off against Hungary, Petrovi\u0107 received a death threat by an anonymous phone caller. The caller gave Petrovi\u0107 twelve hours to leave Yugoslavia before being killed. In the time preceding the death threat, Petrovi\u0107 had been subject to a whispering campaign that suggested he once played for the Croatian national team during the breakup of Yugoslavia, before Croatia became an official FIFA member. Petrovi\u0107 strongly denied this, and teammate Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107 accused some journalists of jeopardizing Petrovi\u0107's life by spreading fake news about him. Petrovi\u0107 went on to play for Yugoslavia at the 1998 FIFA World Cup.Record at FIFA Tournaments \u2013 FIFA After the rumors were spread, Petrovi\u0107 took several opportunities to explain how the media identified him. When a Dutch journalist asked Petrovi\u0107 about his nationality considering the breakup of Yugoslavia, Petrovi\u0107 insisted on his identity as a Yugoslav. He explained himself with the following: ==Managerial and coaching career== On 21 August 2006 Petrovi\u0107 was appointed as the new head coach of Portuguese team Boavista F.C.. In his first match as manager, Boavista won 3\u20130 against Benfica. However, he resigned in October 2006 after only a month and a half in charge. The following 2007\u20132008 season Petrovic managed RKC Waalwijk to a second place in the Dutch 2nd division and failed to gain promotion to the Eredivisie. In the 2008\u20132009 season he was Martin Jol's assistant at Hamburger SV. On 28 July 2010 West Ham United confirmed Petrovi\u0107 as the assistant manager to manager Avram Grant. On 23 November 2010, West Ham parted company with Petrovi\u0107 after less than four months. Upon his departure he made controversial comments about the Premier League questioning its quality. In February 2010, Petrovic was named assistant to manager Guus Hiddink at Anzhi Makhachkala.Petrovic met Hiddink mee naar Anzhi - Rijnmond On 17 March 2015, Petrovi\u0107 was named the assistant to manager Dick Advocaat at Sunderland, but was sacked on 4 October later that year.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34437620 He became assistant to manager Advocaat once more when he joined him at FC Utrecht in 2018.FC Utrecht bevestigt komst Advocaat en Petrovic - Voetbal International ===Botev Plovdiv=== In the beginning of June 2019, Botev Plovdiv introduced Petrovi\u0107 as the new head coach of the club. Following his recommendations the club signed Marko Pervan, Philippe van Arnhem and Rodney Klooster. After a long run of poor results, on 16 October, Petrovi\u0107 was sacked. Shortly after that Philippe van Arnhem and Rodney Klooster were also released. In 12 games under his guidance Botev Plovdiv won only twice, achieved 3 draws and lost 7 matches, last 4 of which in a row. ===Inter Zapre\u0161i\u0107=== In the beginning of January 2020, Inter Zapre\u0161i\u0107 introduced Petrovi\u0107 as the new head coach. On 10 April 2020, following the COVID-19 pandemic, Petrovi\u0107 terminated the contract with the club.
