Each state in the United States has a legislature as part of its form of civil government. Most of the fundamental details of the legislature are specified in the state constitution. With the exception of Nebraska, all state legislatures are bicameral bodies, composed of a lower house (Assembly, General Assembly, State Assembly, House of Delegates, or House of Representatives) and an upper house (Senate). The United States also has one federal district and five non-state territories with local legislative branches, which are also listed below. Among the states, the Nebraska Legislature is the only state with a unicameral body. However, three other territories the District of Columbia, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands also have unicameral bodies. The exact names, dates, term lengths, term limits, electoral systems, electoral districts, and other details are determined by the individual states' laws. == Party summary == {| class=wikitable |- |+ Party control of legislatures |- | Republican-controlled legislatures | 29 |- | Democratic-controlled legislatures | 19 |- | Split legislatures\u201cSplit\u201d in the sense that each of the two chambers are controlled by a different party (e.g., a Democratic Senate and Republican House) or one chamber is evenly split between parties (and thus \"hung\".
