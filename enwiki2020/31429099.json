For his burial, the coffin was not taken through the gate of the graveyard but rather hoisted over the wall and put down away from the other graves as was the custom with executed criminals. Kristoffer Nilsen Svartb\u00e6kken Grindalen (9 September 1804 \u2013 25 February 1876) was a Norwegian criminal, killer and thief. He was born at the crofter's farm Nordre Svartb\u00e6kken in Elverum, and spent 41 years of his life in prisons. He was convicted for a murder and robbery near Ekrumstormyra in L\u00f8ten in 1875, and was beheaded by axe at the site of the murder in 1876, witnessed by estimated 2,500 spectators, in the last public execution in Norway. Moments before his beheading he confessed to the murder. Henrik S\u00f8rensen's painting Svartb\u00e6kken from 1908, inspired by the incident, was much discussed, but is regarded as S\u00f8rensen's breakthrough. ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * * * Category:1804 births Category:1876 deaths Category:People from Elverum Category:Norwegian people convicted of murder Category:Norwegian criminals Category:People executed by Norway by decapitation Category:Executed Norwegian people Category:People executed for murder Category:19th-century executions by Norway ",
