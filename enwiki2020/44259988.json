    "text": "The 2014\u201315 Brownsville Barracudas season was the inaugural season for the Brownsville Barracudas professional indoor soccer club. (The team was also known as Barracudas FC.) The Barracudas, a Southern Division team in the Major Arena Soccer League, played their home games at the Barracudas Sports Complex in Brownsville, Texas. The team was led by owner Oscar Ruvalcaba, general manager Ricardo Rodriguez, and head coach Raul Salazar. The Barracudas finished the 2014\u201315 season with a 4\u201316 record, good enough for 4th place in the Southern Division but not enough to qualify for the playoffs. ==Season summary== Brownsville began the season with a road defeat by the Monterrey Flash before a home opening win against Saltillo Rancho Seco. The team then lost 8 consecutive games before an overtime win at home against Saltillo. Another 6 losses (3 each to the Dallas Sidekicks and Oxford City FC of Texas) preceded a win in Brownsville's final home game against Saltillo. Splitting a road series in Saltillo to end the season, Brownsville ended with a 4\u201316 record and 4th place in the Southern Division. All 4 of Brownsville's wins came at the expense of Saltillo. ==History== Barracudas on the road at the Allen Event Center. Team owner Oscar Ruvalcaba started laying the groundwork for this team in 2001 when he began developing the Barracudas Sports Complex to add more soccer fields in his community. The complex opened in 2004 and began hosting several games each week. Barracudas FC organized as an amateur club that same year and, a decade later, the complex hosts almost 200 teams playing 7-on-7 soccer each week. In May 2014, Ruvalcaba secured an expansion franchise in the new Major Arena Soccer League and began construction of a 2,000-seat open-air soccer arena. ==Off-field moves== In May 2014, the Professional Arena Soccer League added six refugee teams from the failed third incarnation of the Major Indoor Soccer League and reorganized as the Major Arena Soccer League. The 2014\u201315 MASL season will be 20 games long, 4 more than the 16 regular season games of recent PASL seasons. Brownsville joins the league in the new Southern division. The other Southern teams for 2014\u201315 are the Dallas Sidekicks, Hidalgo La Fiera, Monterrey Flash, Saltillo Rancho Seco, and Beaumont-based Oxford City FC of Texas. The Barracudas publicly displayed their new MASL uniforms for the first time on October 18 in the food court at Sunrise Mall in Brownsville. The new uniforms, manufactured by Pirma, use the same colors as the team has worn since its founding as an amateur club in 2004. Brownsville's home uniforms are light blue with white sides and the away uniforms are white with a blue collar. ==Schedule== ===Pre-season=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"40\" | Game ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Day ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"110\" | Date ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Kickoff ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Opponent ! colspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Results ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"240\" | Location ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\" | Attendance |- ! width=\"120\" | Score ! width=\"60\" | Record |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 1 | Sunday | June 29 | 3:15pm | at Austin Capitals (PASL) | L 3\u20132 | 0\u20131 | South Zone South Austin | |} ===Regular season=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"40\" | Game ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Day ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"110\" | Date ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Kickoff ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Opponent ! colspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Results ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"240\" | Location ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\" | Attendance |- ! width=\"120\" | Score ! width=\"60\" | Record |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 1 | Sunday | October 26 | 5:05pm | at Monterrey Flash | L 6\u201315 | 0\u20131 | Arena Monterrey | 6,339 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 2 | Saturday | November 1 | 6:00pm | Saltillo Rancho Seco | W 12\u201311 | 1\u20131 | Barracudas Sports Complex | 850 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 3 | Saturday | November 15 | 7:00pm | at Dallas Sidekicks | L 2\u201314 | 1\u20132 | Allen Event Center | 3,656 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 4 | Saturday | November 22 | 6:00pm | Hidalgo La Fiera | L 3\u20136 | 1\u20133 | Barracudas Sports Complex | 715 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 5 | Saturday | November 29 | 6:00pm | Oxford City FC of Texas | L 4\u20135 | 1\u20134 | Barracudas Sports Complex | 450 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 6 | Sunday | November 30 | 5:05pm | at Monterrey Flash | L 1\u201314 | 1\u20135 | Arena Monterrey | 1,764 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 7 | Saturday | December 6 | 7:05pm | at Oxford City FC of Texas | L 4\u20137 | 1\u20136 | Ford Arena | 1,079 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 8 | Saturday | December 20 | 6:00pm | Dallas Sidekicks | L 3\u201311 | 1\u20137 | Barracudas Sports Complex | 575 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 9 | Saturday | December 27 | 6:00pm | Monterrey Flash | L 1\u20136 | 1\u20138 | Barracudas Sports Complex | 375 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 10 | Sunday | December 28 | 6:00pm | Monterrey Flash | L 8\u20139 | 1\u20139 | Barracudas Sports Complex | 475 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 11 | Saturday | January 3 | 6:00pm | Saltillo Rancho Seco | W 7\u20136 (OT) | 2\u20139 | Barracudas Sports Complex | 225 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 12 | Saturday | January 10 | 2:30pm | at Oxford City FC of Texas | L 4\u20138 | 2\u201310 | Ford Arena | 0 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 13 | Saturday | January 10 | 7:05pm | at Oxford City FC of Texas | L 3\u201310 | 2\u201311 | Ford Arena | 740 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 14 | Saturday | January 24 | 6:00pm | Dallas Sidekicks | L 5\u20139 | 2\u201312 | Barracudas Sports Complex | 375 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 15 | Sunday | January 25 | 6:00pm | Dallas Sidekicks | L 6\u20137 | 2\u201313 | Barracudas Sports Complex | 375 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 16 | Sunday | February 15 | 3:00pm | at Dallas Sidekicks | L 3\u201311 | 2\u201314 | Allen Event Center | 3,109 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 17 | Saturday | February 21 | 6:00pm | Oxford City FC of Texas | L 6\u20139 | 2\u201315 | Barracudas Sports Complex | 240 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 18 | Sunday | February 22 | 1:00pm | Saltillo Rancho Seco | W 11\u20138 | 3\u201315 | Barracudas Sports Complex | 140 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 19 | Friday | February 27 | 8:30pm | at Saltillo Rancho Seco | L 10\u201315 | 3\u201316 | Deportivo Rancho-Seco Saltillo | 70 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 20 | Saturday | February 28 | 5:00pm | at Saltillo Rancho Seco | W 8\u20134 | 4\u201316 | Deportivo Rancho-Seco Saltillo | 145 |} Originally scheduled for January 31 but rescheduled after Hidalgo La Fiera left the league mid-season.
