    "text": "Martin Krebs (born 2 November 1956) is a German prelate of the Catholic Church who has worked in the diplomatic service of the Holy See since 1991. He has been an archbishop since 2008 when he received the first of several postings as a papal nuncio. ==Biography== Martin Krebs was born in Essen, Germany, on 2 November 1956. He was ordained to the priesthood there on 10 October 1983. He entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See on 1 July 1991, and held posts in Burundi, Japan, Austria, the Czech Republic, the European Community and the United States. He is fluent in English, Italian, French, Spanish and Czech. On 8 September 2008, Pope Benedict XVI named him titular archbishop of Taborenta and Apostolic Nuncio in Guinea and Mali. He welcomed the assignment, describing Guinea as \"a predominately Islamic country in which Islam is not lived fanatically\". On 8 May 2013, Pope Francis appointed him Apostolic Nuncio to New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Palau, and Micronesia, as well as Apostolic Delegate to the Pacific Ocean. He received his episcopal consecration from Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone on 16 November. On 23 September, Francis added Fiji, Samoa and Vanuatu to his responsibilities. On 18 January 2014, he added Tonga as well, and on 3 May the Marshall Islands and Nauru. While fulfilling this array of assignments he used Wellington, New Zealand, as his base. On several occasions he played a role in the affairs of the troubled Archdiocese of Aga\u00f1a on Guam, trying to reconcile disputing parties in 2014, receiving a report that Archbishop Anthony Apuron had sodomized a boy years earlier in 2015, and trying without success to persuade Apuron to resign in 2016. On 16 June 2018, Francis named Krebs Apostolic Nuncio to Uruguay. ==References== Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:People from Essen Category:21st-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Uruguay Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Guinea Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Mali Category:Apostolic Nuncios to New Zealand Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Fiji Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Palau Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Kiribati Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Tonga Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Nauru Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Vanuatu Category:Apostolic Nuncios to the Cook Islands Category:Apostolic Nuncios to the Marshall Islands Category:Apostolic Nuncios to the Federated States of Micronesia Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Samoa Category:Apostolic Nuncios to the Pacific Ocean Category:Clergy from North Rhine-Westphalia ",
