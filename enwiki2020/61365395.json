Scarr lies on its own small massif that includes Scarr North-West Top and Kanturk ; it is bounded by Lough Dan to the east and the Glenmacnass Valley on the west. Scarr's sharp peak gives it a distinctive profile amongst the rounded summits of the Wicklow mountains, and it forms the backdrop to scenic views across the Guinness Estate and Lough Dan. ==Hill walking== A popular trail is the 14-kilometre 4-5 hour Scarr and Kanturk Loop walk, which starts at a lay-by outside Oldbridge () at the southern end of Lough Dan. The recommended route is counter-clockwise, summiting Kanturt first and then crossing to the summit of Scarr before returning to Oldbridge. ==Bibliography== * * * * ==Gallery== File:Scarr Mountain, Wicklow.jpg|Scarr in Winter File:White Hill, Wicklow, Ireland.jpg|Scarr (left) from White Hill boardwalk on Djouce File:Scarr Mountain from the Guinness Estate, Luggala.jpg|From the Guinness Estate File:Panorama of Lough Dan, Scarr, and Tonelagee.jpg|Lough Dan, Scarr, and Tonelagee, from Mullaghcleevaun ==See also== *Wicklow Way *Wicklow Round *Wicklow Mountains *Lists of mountains in Ireland *List of mountains of the British Isles by height *List of Marilyns in the British Isles *List of Hewitt mountains in England, Wales and Ireland == References == ==External links== *MountainViews: The Irish Mountain Website, Scarr *MountainViews: Irish Online Mountain Database *The Database of British and Irish Hills , the largest database of British Isles mountains (\"DoBIH\") *Hill Bagging UK & Ireland, the searchable interface for the DoBIH Category:Marilyns of Ireland Category:Mountains and hills of County Wicklow Category:Hewitts of Ireland Category:Mountains under 1000 metres ",
