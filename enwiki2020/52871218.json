As the Russian Orthodox Church does not tolerate divorce, he one day fakes his suicide so that his wife can be with her lover Viktor Karenin. While he begins to lead a life of illegality and subterfuge which despite his new companion does not make him content, this decisive step to the fake death which has made him a \"living corpse\" is no real happiness. One day it is found out that Fyodor is still alive and that Liza is guilty of bigamy. She is accused and a sentence for her \"offense\" waits for her, which is in actuality Fyodor's. Protassov, who never wanted to take this so far, decides therefore to one last sacrifice: he now completes the deceived act and actually commits suicide by shooting himself. ==Cast== * Vsevolod Pudovkin as Fyodor Protasov * Maria Jacobini as Yelizaveta Andreyevna Protasova (Liza) * Viola Garden as Sasha (Liza's sister) * Julia Serda as Anna Pavlovna * Nato Vachnadze as Masha, a gypsy * Gustav Diessl as Viktor Mikhajlovich Karenin * Vera Maretskaya as Prostitute * Daniil Vvedenskiy as Artem'ev (The Good Spirit) * Vladimir Uralsky as Petushkov * Boris Barnet as Sailor in tavern * Carola H\u00f6hn * Karl Junge-Swinburne * Porfiri Podobed * Pyotr Repnin * Sylvia Torf ==References== ==Bibliography== * Taylor, Richard.
