    "text": "The following are schools that field collegiate teams in rifle in the NCAA. Since there are only 23 Division I schools, 3 Division II schools, and 3 Division III schools that sponsor rifle, the NCAA holds only a single, all- division championship. There are 2 men's teams, 9 women's teams, and 22 mixed/co-ed teams (the number of teams exceeds the number of schools because four schools field two teams). All listed schools field a single co-ed team unless otherwise indicated. ==Division I== * U.S. Air Force Academy (Air Force) * University of Akron * U.S. Military Academy (Army) * The Citadel * Georgia Southern University (women only) * Jacksonville State University * University of Kentucky * University of Memphis * Morehead State University * Murray State University * University of Mississippi (women only) * U.S. Naval Academy (Navy) * University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln (Nebraska) (women only) * North Carolina State University * Ohio State University * Texas Christian University (TCU) (women only) * University of Tennessee at Martin (co-ed, women discontinued) * University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) * University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) (women only) * Virginia Military Institute (VMI) * West Virginia University * Wofford College ==Division II== * University of Alaska-Fairbanks * University of North Georgia ==Division III== * John Jay College of Criminal Justice * Massachusetts Institute of Technology * U.S. Coast Guard Academy ==Conferences== *Great America Rifle Conference, a rifle- only conference *Mid-Atlantic Rifle Conference, a rifle-only conference, the largest rifle conference, it includes NCAA-sanctioned teams and non-sanctioned club sport teams. *Ohio Valley Conference, the only Division I all-sports conference that sponsored rifle before the SoCon added it in 2016\u201317. *Patriot Rifle Conference, a rifle-only conference *Southern Conference, resumed the sport in 2016\u201317 after a 30-year hiatus. ==References== Rifle Category:College rifle teams in the United States Category:Sport shooting-related lists ",
