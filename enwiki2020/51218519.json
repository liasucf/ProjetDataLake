This time, both companies came to an agreement, resulting in the respective supervisory boards giving their assent in October 2014, followed by the owners of both companies in November and December 2014 respectively. The merger was finalized on July 1, 2015. == Services offered == Fiducia & GAD currently operates two core banking applications \"agree21\" and \"bank21\". The banks associated with the former GAD eG currently employ the core banking application \u201cbank21\u201d, whereas the application used by those banks associated with the former Fiducia IT AG was called \u201cagree\u201d. By 2019 all German Volksbanks and Raiffeisenbanks are to be migrated to the new joint banking application \u201cagree21\u201d, which is primarily based on agree.
