Created in the 1927 renumbering, it was designated to run from Rockleigh to Bayonne, along the Hudson River.ROUTE NO. 1. Alpine to Bayonne. Beginning at the New York state line on state highway route heretofore designated as Route No. 18--north in Alpine and terminating in Bayonne, by way of Alpine, Tenafly, Fort Lee and Ridgefield, in Bergen county, North Bergen, Jersey City and Bayonne, in Hudson county. L. 1929, c. 126, p. 215, s. 1. That same year, Route S1 was created as a spur along Bergen Boulevard, now signed Route 63. The Route 1 designation was placed on a new route north of Fort Lee in 1929, replacing the existing Route 18N; the old section of Route 1 still survives as County Route 501, and Route S1A, now Route 67, was created from the remnants of Route 18N not taken over by the realignment of Route 1. By the 1953 renumbering, the entirety of the route was occupied by various U.S. Routes, and the Route 1 designation was abandoned in favour of these designation. Its sections are now parts of U.S. Route 9W, U.S. Route 1/9, U.S. Route 1/9 Truck, and Route 440. == References == ==See also== * * *State highways in New Jersey 001 Category:U.S. Route 1 Category:U.S. Route 9 ",
