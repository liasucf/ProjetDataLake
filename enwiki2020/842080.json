    "text": "A fluoropolymer is a fluorocarbon-based polymer with multiple carbon\u2013fluorine bonds. It is characterized by a high resistance to solvents, acids, and bases. The best known fluoropolymer is polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon). ==History== In 1938, polytetrafluoroethylene (DuPont brand name Teflon) was discovered by accident by a recently hired DuPont Ph.D., Roy J. Plunkett. While working with tetrafluoroethylene gas, he noticed that a previously-pressurized cylinder had no pressure remaining. In dissecting the cylinder, he found a mass of white solid in a quantity similar to that of the tetrafluoroethylene gas. It was determined that this material was a new-to-the-world polymer. Tests showed the substance was resistant to corrosion from most substances and had better high temperature stability than any other plastic. By early 1941, a crash program was making commercial quantities. ==Properties== Fluoropolymers share the properties of fluorocarbons in that they are not as susceptible to the van der Waals force as hydrocarbons. This contributes to their non-stick and friction reducing properties. Also, they are stable due to the stability multiple carbon\u2013fluorine bonds add to a chemical compound. Fluoropolymers may be mechanically characterized as thermosets or thermoplastics. Fluoropolymers can be homopolymers or Copolymer. ==Examples of monomers used to prepare fluoropolymers== * Perfluorocycloalkene (PFCA) * Ethylene (Ethane) (E) * Vinyl fluoride (fluoroethylene) (VF1) * Vinylidene fluoride (1,1-difluoroethylene) (VDF or VF2) * Tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) * Chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE) * Propylene (P) * Hexafluoropropylene (HFP) * Perfluoropropylvinylether (PPVE) * Perfluoromethylvinylether (PMVE) ==Current market and forecast== The global demand on fluoropolymers was estimated at approximately US$7.25 billion in 2011. Driven by new developments of products, applications, and processes, as well as strong demands in new markets, the demand is expected to grow by 5.8% in the following years. Some of the world's largest manufacturers of fluoropolymers include DuPont, 3M, Solvay Chemicals, BASF and Dyneon. ==Examples of fluoropolymers== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Fluoropolymer !!
