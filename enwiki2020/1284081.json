From 1985 to 1986 he served as the majority whip for the Republican Party. After his service in the state legislature, McKeachnie served as the chairman of the Board of trustees for Utah State University. It was while serving as a university trustee that McKeachnie became Utah's fifth Lieutenant Governor. In October, 2003, Utah Governor Michael O. Leavitt resigned his office, having been appointed to a position in the Bush Administration. Leavitt was succeeded by his lieutenant governor, Olene S. Walker, and to fill the vacancy that she had left in the office of Lieutenant Governor, Walker appointed McKeachnie. The Walker\u2013McKeachnie administration was short lived, however. In May 2004, at the Utah State Republican Convention, Walker failed to win her party's nomination to seek a full term, and in January 2005, both she and her lieutenant governor left office. ==Today== Today McKeachnie continues to be involved in Utah politics and policies. He is prominent in Utah as an expert on rural issues, including gas and oil-field discoveries. His expertise in both rural and energy issues makes him a highly sought-after advisor. McKeachnie served in the Huntsman administration as the leader of Rural Affairs and continues to do so in the Herbert administration. McKeachnie is also a close confidante of his successor as Lieutenant Governor, Gary Herbert, now the Governor. McKeachnie also currently serves as a member of the Board overseeing the School and Institutional Trust Lands Association. == References == Category:1943 births Category:American Latter Day Saints Category:Lieutenant Governors of Utah Category:Living people Category:Members of the Utah House of Representatives Category:Southern Utah University alumni Category:University of Utah alumni Category:Utah Republicans Category:Utah State University people Category:2004 United States presidential electors ",
