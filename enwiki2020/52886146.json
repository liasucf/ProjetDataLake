The Oriental Desert Express is a privately chartered tourist train offered between Oujda and Bouarfa, Morocco. It runs along a little-used railway line, and was featured in the 2015 film Spectre. ==History == The line used by the Oriental Desert Express was originally built in the 1920s and 1930s as part of the Mediterranean\u2013Niger Railway, but is now only used twice a week by trains carrying zinc, lead, and copper from local mines. Edi Kunz, a Swiss citizen living in Morocco, learned of the line and worked with Moroccan authorities for three years to start a tourist train along it, overcoming questions from the Moroccan government over the use of a historical \"prince's wagon\" passenger car and from the Swiss embassy in Morocco over the train's viability. Kunz ended up committing five million euros to the project. The first trip was made in 2006, and the train runs twice annually, such as in 2013 and 2017. Outside camera shots of the Oriental Desert Express were featured in the 2015 James Bond film Spectre. == Journey == , the total travel time of the Oriental Desert Express can take between eight or twelve hours. The express begins in Oujda in the early morning with an EMD GT26CW-2 locomotive, known locally as a DH-370, and a consist of cars that include both air conditioning and open windows. Traversing the Hautes Plaines, the train makes a stop at the small town of Tendrara, Tagmo\u1e0dant. While the train generally travels at a speed of about , travel time between Tendrara and Bouarfa can vary greatly due to unplanned stops to clear sand from the railroad track, for which the train carries diagonal shovels, and meeting nomadic tribes. One such meeting was related by Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung: > ... again the train stops. There are sheep outside and tents. We have > arrived at nomads. The family leader invites us to tea in his tent. The > women look at us curiously. But soon a conversation begins with hands and > much laughter. The family belongs to the tribe of the Arabic-speaking Beni > Guil, who have lived as nomads for over a thousand years. == References == == External links == *Official website *YouTube video *Radio interview with Edi Kunz (in German) *Sand, stars on board Morocco's Oriental Desert Express *D\u2019Oujda \u00e0 Bouarfa \u00e0 bord de l\u2019Oriental Desert Express *Morocco tourists make tracks on 007's 'desert express' *Bond's 'Desert Express' for Morocco tourists *D'Oujda \u00e0 Bouarfa \u00e0 bord de l'Oriental Desert Express Category:Rail transport in Morocco ",
