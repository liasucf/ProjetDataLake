    "text": "Kink.com is a San Francisco-based bondage internet pornography company that runs a group of websites devoted to BDSM and related fetishes. Kink.com, along with Kink Studios, LLC, Hogtied.com and Behindkink.com are DBAs for Cybernet Entertainment LLC, the parent company that operates the studio. ==Origin== Kink.com was started by UK native Peter Acworth in 1997 while he was a doctoral candidate in finance at Columbia University. After reading a story in a British tabloid about a fireman who made \u00a3250,000 in a short period by starting an Internet pornography website, Acworth decided to start a pornographic web site of his own. Since Acworth had what he described as a lifelong interest in bondage, he oriented the site toward BDSM pornography.\"A Disciplined Business\" by Jon Mooallem, The New York Times Magazine, April 29, 2007. The site was called Hogtied.com and initially featured content that was licensed from other primary producers. The site was successful and was soon grossing several thousand dollars per day. Acworth left his graduate studies to work on the site full-time. ==Acquisition of the San Francisco Armory== In 1998, Acworth moved the company from New York City to San Francisco. Finding that sales were leveling off because other sites were using the same content, Acworth began producing his own material, initially featuring himself with various models whom he found through Craigslist or through his photographer friends.\"The New Pornographers\" by Robin Rinaldi, 7x7, August 01, 2006. He opened the company's second site, Fucking Machines, in 2000,\" The Man Behind the Fucking Machines\", Village Voice, July 16, 2008 and has since opened 26 additional subscription Web sites.\"Kink.com Celebrates its 10 Year Anniversary\" , Behind Kink, February 1, 2008. Several Web sites under the Kink.com umbrella feature directors who relocated following the demise of Insex as a result of US government pressure in 2005, but offer more of a focus on consensuality than Insex was known for. Exterior view of the San Francisco Armory In late 2006, Kink.com purchased the San Francisco Armory for $14.5 million, for use as a production studio. A group known as the Mission Armory Community Collective formed to oppose Kink.com's use of the building and in early February 2007 held a public protest in front of the building.\"Kink hearing: The pornographer's purchase of the Armory faces more roadblocks\" by Deborah Giattina, San Francisco Bay Guardian, March 7, 2007. At one point, there were plans to demolish part of the building to make way for a condominium development. Such news brought in supporters who welcomed Kink.com's preservation of the historic building as part of an overall attempt to revitalize and bring back business to the area, without altering the appearance of the historic building.\"San Francisco Planning Commission - Special Public Hearing\", SFGTV, March 8, 2007. (link to streaming Windows Media Video and downloadable MP3 audio) San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom also expressed concern over the Kink.com purchase, and scheduled a special meeting of the San Francisco Planning Commission in March 2007 to review the company's use of the building. The meeting was well-attended by both supporters and opponents of the Kink.com purchase. One opponent, anti-pornography campaigner Melissa Farley compared the images produced by Kink.com to images of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib, and testified against the purchase.\"Kink.Com in San Francisco: Women and Gay Men's Abu Ghraib\" by Melissa Farley, Traffick Jamming (blog), February 8, 2007. The Planning Commission ruled that Kink.com was not in violation of any law or zoning requirement.

Although Kink.com has stated that its activities would be invisible to the surrounding neighborhood, La Casa de las Madres, a neighboring women's shelter, announced that they would be leaving the location because of the media scrutiny of Kink.com's presence. \"Service organization flees from kinky Mission neighbor\" by Sarah Duxbury, San Francisco Business Times, March 23, 2007. In addition to utilizing the Armory for its own productions, Kink.com also rents space in the historic building to local independent filmmakers to use as locations in non-pornographic narrative films and videos. By 2013 Kink.com was converting rooms at the Armory into webcam studios that independent webcam models could rent. In January 2017, Kink.com announced that it would cease to use the Armory for film production. In 2018, Acworth sold the Armory for $65 million dollars. ==Specialty web sites== A shoot for Public Disgrace In 2007, the company's web site Fucking Machines was involved in a trademark dispute when the United States Patent and Trademark Office refused to grant a trademark for the name of the site, asserting that it was obscene. Also in 2007, the company began streaming regular live shows, in part as a defense against copyright infringement.\"At Kink.com, A Live Tool Against Piracy\", CNet News, March 30, 2007. By 2008 live shows were being streamed by Device Bondage, a Kink.com bondage site, and erotic wrestling site Ultimate Surrender began streaming its competitive matches live in 2008.\"Ultimate Surrender Streams 3 Matches Live\", Adult Video News, August 18, 2008.

In 2008, the company added on-demand technology to its web sites, selling updates to their websites on a per-episode basis rather than strictly by subscription.\"Kink.com Launches Kink On Demand\", Adult Video News, August 6, 2008. This system recently began adding third-party content, including that from Germany's Marquis.\"Kink.com Partners With Germany's Marquis\", Adult Video News, August 19, 2008. Also in 2008, the company launched a site called Bound Gods, a gay bondage site directed by Van Darkholme (also the director of Naked Kombat). Bound Gods was launched under a new gay-focused division, KinkMen.com. In 2014, the company announced that it was stopping production on its \"wildly popular\" Public Disgrace and Bound in Public sites, and changing Hardcore Gangbangs to make it more explicitly the fantasy of the female participant. Kink announced that it was increasing educational efforts, with the aim of \"demystifying alternative sexualities\" and would be welcoming the public into The Armory. It wished to turn Kink.com into a lifestyle brand \u00e0 la Playboy. ==Documentary== Banner of Fucking Machines -a website under Kink.com In 2013 Kink, a documentary, was made about the company. ==Award nominations== * 2008, Kink.com was nominated for a 2009 AVN Award in a new category, Best Adult Web Site.\"Complete 2009 AVN Awards Nominee List\" , AVNAwards.com, November 25, 2008. * 2010 XBIZ Award Nominee - Innovative Company of the YearXBIZ Announces Finalist Nominees for 2010 XBIZ Awards, XBIZ, Wednesday, Dec 16, 2009 ==Awards== * 2009 XBIZ Award - FSC Leadership Award * 2009 XBIZ Award - Original Web Content * 2011 AVN Award - Best Alternative Web Site * 2012 XBIZ Award - Fetish Studio of the Year * 2013 XBIZ Award - Specialty Site of the Year * 2013 AVN Award - Best Alternative Website * 2014 AVN Award - Best Alternative Web Site * 2014 AVN Award - Best Web Premiere - Public Disgrace 31515 * 2014 XBIZ Award - Specialty Site of the Year * 2014 XBIZ Award - BDSM Site of the Year (DivineBitches.com) * 2015 XBIZ Award - Adult Site of the Year - BDSMXBIZ Award Winners, XBIZ, January, 2015 * 2015 CyberSocket Web Award - Best Hardcore/Fetish Site (KinkMen.com) * 2016 XBIZ Award - Adult Site of the Year - BDSM * 2016 CyberSocket Web Award - Best Hardcore/Fetish Site (KinkMen.com) * 2016 TEA Award - Best Scene (Yasmin Lee and Lucas Knight on TS Seduction) * 2016 AVN Award - Best Alternative Website * 2017 AVN Award - Best BDSM movie - Deception: A XXX Thriller * 2017 AVN Award - Best Alternative Website * 2017 XBIZ Award - Adult Site of the Year \u2014 BDSM * 2017 TEA Award - Best Scene (Threesome with Aubrey Kate, Will Havoc, and Phoenix Marie on TS Seduction) * 2017 StorErotica Award - Fetish Company of the Year (Kink by Doc Johnson) * 2017 Adultex Award - Best Fetish/Alternate Product Range (Kink by Doc Johnson) * 2018 XBIZ Award - BDSM Site of the Year * 2018 XBIZ Award - BDSM Release of the Year (Whipped Ass 21: Masochistic MILFs) * 2018 XBIZ Award - Fetish Product/Line of the Year (Kink by Doc Johnson) * 2018 StorErotica Award - BDSM Product of the Year (Power Banger Sex Machine, Kink by Doc Johnson) * 2018 CyberSocket Web Award - Best Hardcore/Fetish Site (KinkMen) * 2018 NightMoves Award - Best Fetish/Taboo/Specialty Release (Hardcore Gangbang Parodies #3) ==See also== * Kink (sexual) * Insex * Bondage pornography ==References== == Further reading == Lynn, Regina.
