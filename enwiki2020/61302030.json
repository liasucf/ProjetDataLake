The winner of three games wins the set. === Scoring === Games go to 21 points. If the score is 20-20, then it is win by two points. For example, 22\u201324.

During the 1930s, badminton had become a popular sport in the United States. Establishments such as the YMCA, universities and more all formed badminton clubs and the popularity of the sport began to take growth. The sport was also aided by the support of celebrity participation. Celebrities such as Bette Davis, Douglas Fairbanks, Dick Powell and more all participated in the sport helping badminton gain popularity during the mid half of the 20th century. Starting in 1936 the American Badminton Association was formed, however, in 1978 and 1996 the name would be changed to its current name of USA Badminton ( or USAB). The main reason for the evolutionary changes is because different groups and clubs from all around the United States joined together to standardize the rules of the game. The time period between 1949 and 1967 was the biggest period of badminton popularity in the United States. In 1949 David Freeman brought the United States its first ever world championships. Freeman won the Men's Singles at the All-England Championships. Additionally, between 1949 and 1967 the United States won 23 championships in badminton. The success led to Sports Illustrated featuring Joe Alston on the Cover of the March issue of 1955 to recognize the United States successes in badminton during that time period. In 2016, USAB announced that they would be relocating their professional training facilities and headquarters from Colorado Spring to Anaheim California. == Important Figures == === Ben Lee === Lee is the current Board of Directors Chair.

One of the main reasons is because badminton in the United States is seen as a backyard sport. Due to this, the sport has not grown much in the United States. Another reason is the lack of olympic success. Team USAB has not had much success in their olympic runs. This lack of success is another reason why the sport has not grown in comparison to other sports that have had olympic success. Finally, wages are a huge reason why badminton has not gown. Badminton fails to receive a lot of media attention in the United States and with that comes low wages. Participants can earn up to $15,000 for winning a championship. That is a relatively small amount of money in comparison to the average football player that has a salary of 2.7 million dollars. == Diane Cornell == January 7, 2020 marks the death of Diane Cornell.
