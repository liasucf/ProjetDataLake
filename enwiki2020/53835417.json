Baillie was a tenant of William Conolly. From 1782 to 1814 it was John Begnall's Celbridge Academy, offering education, among others, future bishop John Jebb and the sons of George Napier. It also served as a fever hospital (cholera), vicarage and dispensary at various times, and as an Irish Constabulary barracks from 1831 to 1841. After 1861 it was leased by Richard Maunsell of Oakley Park. The interior was restored in 1985\u201395 by the owners, the Stuart family. In 2003 funding of \u20ac7,500 was acquired from the Irish Georgian Society for restoration. ==Description== Kildrought House is a house of two storeys to the front elevation and three to the rear (including a basement).
