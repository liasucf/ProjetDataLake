    "text": "Goldrunner is a vertically scrolling shooter published developed by Steve Bak and Pete Lyon for the Atari ST and published by Microdeal in 1987. Rob Hubbard composed the music. An Amiga version followed, as well as a sequel, 1988's Goldrunner II. ==Gameplay== Goldrunner is a freely vertically scrolling shooter game where it is possible to fly back and forth as in Defender. The player steers a golden spaceship equipped with two laser cannons, flying over huge ring worlds whose structures must be destroyed. The ship has a speed booster to accelerate. == Sequels == The immediate follow-on, Goldrunner II, offered a similar aesthetic to original title. A third entry in the series was planned, entitled Goldrunner 3D. This was to mark a departure from the traditional 2D scrolling shooter format with a radical new look and gameplay. Trailed as early as 1989, the project suffered significant delays however, finally seeing release under Ocean as Epic in 1992. ==References== Category:1987 video games Category:Amiga games Category:Atari ST games Category:Video games scored by David Whittaker Category:Video games scored by Rob Hubbard Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Vertically scrolling shooters ",
