The CD contained a recorded performance of one of Kyle's acts in the Seattle, Washington comedy club, The Comedy Underground. The CD contains 13 tracks, all but one being part of the stand-up routine. The last was a comedy sketch. The DVD contains a 52-minute-long documentary of Kyle's road tour of 68 colleges. It also includes a performance by Kyle on the Comedy Central television show Premium Blend. The documentary follows Kyle through his \"68 College Tour\" slightly as an 80's Nintendo game, a gag on Kyle's joke about Nintendo. ==Track listing== #14 Hour Show #And That's Gonna Be Track 1 #Me Telling You That Tracks 2 And 1 Are The 14 Hour Show #Four Hacky Travel Jokes #Generation Nintendo #Pills Drunk Daddy #My Weird Jokes #Elementary President #The Virgin Mary, The Alien, And My Grandma #Cheating, Dreaming Old People Who Won't Shut Up #Asian Bell #SCHMcDonalds #Bonus Sketch ==The DVD== The DVD of the Road Documentary is 52 minutes long, and displays the journey Kyle takes through visiting 68 colleges.
