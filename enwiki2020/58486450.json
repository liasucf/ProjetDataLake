From 1950 to 1956 he studied physics with a focus on astrophysics at the University of Jena. He then worked at the Babelsberg Observatory, which was merged with the Central Institute for Astrophysics (now Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam) in 1969. Hans Oleak received his doctorate at the University of Jena in 1963, followed in 1973 by a Dissertation B at the Academy of Sciences of the GDR.
