Dowek also was a founder of the Association of Visual Artists of the Republic of Argentina (AVARA), now labeled a Vice President. == Biography == Diana Dowek was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina on January 1, 1942. She has been labeled a Postwar and Contemporary Artist. It is worth mentioning that in 1975, Dowek experienced a huge change in her life; the coup that overturned the Argentinian President. Some sources do, however, note that this event as well as the Vietnam war is what led Diana Dowek to her activist movements, seeing as she experienced so much terrorism. In 1964, Diana Dowek would settle down and marry her husband before moving to Italy. While they did enjoy the life they lived out in the country, it only took a year before they felt homesick, thus packing up once again and returning to Argentina. From that point on, they would stay in Argentina ever since. Diana Dowek would go through some turning point events, such as a coup d'etat that was planned in order to overthrow the President Isabel Peron, leaving the government to be led by a military junta. Due to this horrific event, Argentina would mark this time period as \"Argentina's Dirty War\"; a period that included terrorism and socialistic riots. This event could be compared to the predecessor, French Reign of Terror period, since similar in some events. This \"Dirty War\" had ended with 30,000 people disappearing by the year 1983. == Education == Sources indicate that Diana Dowek first entered Escuela de Bellas Artes Manuel Belgrano in Buenos Aires (roughly translated to the Manuel Belgrano School of Fine Arts) at the ripe age of thirteen before she later enrolled in a similar school, Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes Prilidiano Pueyrred\u00f3n (National Fine Arts). Both schools were within her general vicinity of Buenos Aires. While in attendance at Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes Prilidiano Pueyrred\u00f3n, Dowek demanded educational reform alongside other members of the student movement, protesting the active militance opposition so many of her colleagues were up against. During these years, she would make connections and build what could be described as friendships with other important figures, such as Horacion Safons and Margarita Paska, eventually forming an \"active cohort among Buenos Aires' artistic avant-gardes\" in other words being, they would form a power group. == Activism == During her time in school, Diana Dowek's early work all portrayed her political stance, and most importantly her attempts at raising awareness of social issues and struggles during President Isabel Peron's reign. Dowek was known to have a unique style that led to a number of metaphors being iterated, resulting in over fifty paintings that would document urban uprisings. One of the most known paintings that conveyed these terroristic events would be Paisaje con retrovisor II. Dowek was engaged in a Post-War movement, promoting human rights and raising awareness. It is known that Ford Falcon cars became a common subject in her painting due to the disappearance of persons in 1983, owed to police often abducting people with unlicensed Falcons. == Artworks == === Painting === Diana Dowek ==== Paisaje con retrovisor II, 1975 ==== Also known as (Landscape with side view mirror II), this painting is part of a miniseries that became an addition to the Collection of Dr. Jos\u00e9 Abadi. In an LA Times article, this piece was denoted as one of the most startling works in the exhibit, which can be owed to the still bodies in the car's rearview mirror. The world within this painting seems to be dystopic, and with further investigation, it is revealed that this painting was owed to the coup d'etat that has earlier changed life for the visual artists Diana Dowek. == Exhibitions == -1968 Galeria Lirolay, Bueno Aires -1985 Pintado en Argentina, Museo Eduardo Sivori, Centro Cultural de Buenos Aires -1996 Zana Cat\u00e1strofe: El poder vulnerable, Fundaci\u00f3n Federico Klemm, Buenos Aires -2001 Diana Dowek: Exposici\u00f3n retrospectiva, 1972, Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Buenos Aires -2003 Ansia y Devoci\u00f3n.
