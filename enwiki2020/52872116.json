    "text": "The 24 Hrs Tour (advertised as Spring Tour 2017 and Summer Tour 2017) is the fifth concert tour by English recording artist, Olly Murs. The tour supports his fifth studio album, 24 Hrs (2016). Beginning March 2017, the tour played over 50 concerts in Europe and Asia. ==Background== The tour was announced September 2016 on Murs various social media platforms. The first left of dates sold well, prompting a second leg of outdoor shows revealed in November 2016. Rehearsals began February 2017 in Brighton. Discussing his open air dates, Murs stated: > \"A summer tour is not something I've done in a long time and there's places > on it that I haven't been to in a while, so it'll be good to get out and see > those people. The outdoor shows are always that little bit crazier. When > you're in an arena, you can create more of a story on the stage, but for a > festival or a park, it's all just about the live performance.\" ==Critical reception== Shows in the UK were high praised amongst local critics. Lorna Hughes (Liverpool Echo) gave Murs performance in Liverool five out of five stars. She wrote: \"Olly is the consummate entertainer, and at times seems to be having even more fun than the audience. Between songs he shares how much he loves Liverpool and how a very honest Scouse lady in catering pointed out the giant spot on his face.\" In Birmingham, Justine Halifax (Birmingham Mail) gave the concert four out of five stars. \"He then delivered the party atmosphere that he had promised when he took to the stage. Accompanied by an amazing nine-piece band and four backing singers, the former X-Factor runner up, who announced that he was 'feeling a little bit frisky', then romped through hits from his five albums.\" Matilda Egere-Cooper (London Evening Standard) gave the shows in London three out of five stars. She states: \"With nods to Robbie Williams and Justin Timberlake, his gig was 90 minutes of fun-filled showmanship from a singer who's learned he's better off sticking to his strengths. Strokes of laddish humour, dad-dancing and chart- toppers such as Heart Skips a Beat and Dance With Me Tonight all appeared among the fancy visuals and pyrotechnics.\" ==Opening acts== *Louisa Johnson \\- '''' *Bodg & Matt https://twitter.com/ollyofficial/status/839235629024178176 *James Cusack *Simon Morykin *Simon Pinkham *Dave Kelly *Mike Toolan *Rob Ellis *Matt Lissack *Dan Kelly *Rob & Katy *Steve Power *Mark Wright (TV personality) *Scott Mills *Pete Snodden *Eoghan McDermott ==Setlist== The following setlist was obtained from the concert, held on 17 March 2017, at the Manchester Arena in Manchester, England.
