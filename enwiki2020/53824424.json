    "text": "\"Yosemite\" is a song by American rapper Travis Scott. It was released on November 20, 2018, as the third single from Scott's third studio album, Astroworld (2018), and contains guest vocals from Gunna and Nav. ==Background and composition== When \"Yosemite\" was originally released, Nav had an unusually quiet voice in the song, which went viral, resulting in memes regarding the rapper. It was later remastered. The song's production incorporates airy flutes and Western twangs. == Critical reception == \"Yosemite\" received positive reviews from critics, with a majority of the praise going towards Gunna's feature and the song's guitar sample. Despite mostly positive reviews, the original mix to Nav's verse was heavily criticized for being too quiet and poorly mixed. == Commercial performance == \"Yosemite\" entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 25 on the issue dated August 18, 2018, where it became the fourth highest charting song from the album. It managed to chart for 18 weeks in total on the Hot 100. ==Music video== The official music video for the song, directed by Nabil Elderkin, was released on Travis Scott's YouTube channel on November 30, 2018. In the video, a young Travis Scott is seen looking for Astroworld through a dense jungle. The kid's journey to find the theme park is a symbolic representation of Scott's rise to fame and the commercial success that came with creating, or \"finding,\" his third studio album Astroworld. Gunna also appears in the video with the adult Travis Scott on a plane as they perform the song. Nav does not appear in the video. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018\u201319) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal (AFP) | 337 |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| United States | November 20, 2018 | Urban contemporary | rowspan=\"2\"| | |- |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2018 singles Category:2018 songs Category:Epic Records singles Category:Grand Hustle Records singles Category:Gunna (rapper) songs Category:Internet memes introduced in 2018 Category:Music memes Category:Nav (rapper) songs Category:Travis Scott songs Category:Songs written by Travis Scott Category:Songs written by Nav (rapper) Category:Songs written by Gunna (rapper) Category:Cactus Jack Records singles Category:Songs written by Turbo (record producer) Category:Song recordings produced by Turbo (record producer) ",
