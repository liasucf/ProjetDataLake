Heyborne has also worked extensively as an audiobook narrator. == Early life and education == Heyborne graduated from Alta High School in 1995 where he was student body president. He is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and served an LDS Mission in the Dominican Republic. He later graduated from the University of Utah with a degree in Economics. == Career == Heyborne is both an actor and a musician. He has released several CDs on which he sings and plays the guitar. However, Heyborne first became widely popular in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints culture after starring in the film The R.M. (2003). His first appearance in a non-LDS film was as \"Teddy\" in The Three Stooges (2012). He is also an accomplished narrator, and has provided voice work for many novels, short stories, and non-fiction titles. Heyborne generated some controversy in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saint community in 2008 after deciding to appear in a Miller Lite beer commercial. Devout members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints do not drink alcohol, and his appearance in a beer commercial was perceived as hypocritical. Heyborne stated that he would prefer to act only in roles aligned with his faith but was unable to predict which offers he might receive. He interpreted the Miller Lite opportunity as an answer to prayer, and a way to feed his family. He was later denied the chance to play at LDS owned BYU, where he had often played in the past, allegedly due to his involvement with the commercial. He also had appeared in a Best Buy Commercial in late-summer 2013, promoting sales for Verizon phones for an upcoming back-to-school sale. His commercial aired during the CBS primetime lineup on August 26, 2013. In 2019 he began as host for a new show on BYU's channel BYUtv called \"Making Good.\" https://www.byutv.org/castmember/fbdf24c6-d0f7-4964-89a9-f109f149923b/kirby- heyborne-making-good https://www.byutv.org/post/d0c4230f-0459-4cb8-81e5-220da2e3dd75/making-good- interview-with-kirby-heyborne ==Works== === Filmography === *Social Suicide (2001) - Tuff Christopherson *The Singles Ward (2002) - Dalen Martin *The R.M.
