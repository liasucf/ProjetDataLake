    "text": "The 2017 Stockholm truck attack killed five. The 2008 Jerusalem bulldozer attack killed three. A vehicle-ramming attack is an assault in which a perpetrator deliberately rams a vehicle into a building, crowd of people, or another vehicle. According to Stratfor Global Intelligence analysts, this attack represented a new militant tactic which is less lethal but could prove more difficult to prevent than suicide bombings. Deliberate vehicle-ramming into crowd of people is a tactic used by terrorists, becoming a major terrorist tactic in the 2010s because it requires little skill to perpetrate and has the potential to cause significant casualties.Amanda Erickson & Isaac Stanley-Becker, How ramming cars into crowds became a major terror tactic, Washington Post (22 March 2017). Deliberate vehicle-ramming has also been carried out in the course of other types of crimes,David Ormerod, John Cyril Smith & Brian Hogan, Smith and Hogan's Criminal Law (13th ed. 2011: Oxford University Press), p. 1138: \"There are at least six ways that a person might be held liable for causing a death by driving. At the most extreme it is possible for D[efendant] to be liable for murder, as when he drivers at V[ictim] with intent to kill or do gbh (great bodily harm).\" including road rage incidents.R.G. Smart, \"Transport Related Stress\" in Stress Consequences: Mental, Neuropsychological and Socioeconomic (ed. George Fink: Academic Press, 2009), p. 708: \"A national study in the United States found that ... of respondents ... 1-2% had gotten out of their cars to hurt other drivers, deliberately hit other drivers, or had carried a weapon.\"Audi driver pleads guilty after video shows him mowing down man in road-rage incident in New Brunswick, Canadian Press (28 February 2017). Deliberate vehicle-ramming incidents have also sometimes been ascribed to the driver's psychiatric disorder.Alan R. Felthouse, \"Personal Violence\" in The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Forensic Psychiatry (2d ed.: eds. Robert I. Simon & Liza H. Gold), pp. 551-52: \"An automobile is a potentially lethal machine. Litigation involving psychiatrists has resulted when a hospitalized patient, after discharges, caused a two-person vehicle accident with death or injuries to one or more victims ... Such cases involve three different types of scenarios. One is the vehicular crash that results from the patient's medication-induced drowsiness at the wheel ... The second scenario is a true accident but is unrelated to any prescribed medication. Rather, the patient's driving is impaired by the disabling effects of mental illness [or] recent consumption of nonprescribed drugs or alcohol. The third situation is when the patient deliberately crashes into another vehicle. Neuropsychiatric conditions that can be associated with an increased risk of vehicular crash include psychotic exacerbation of schizophrenia, profound or suicidal depression, dementia, and disturbances in consciousness, such as epilepsy and narcolepsy.\" Vehicles have also been used by attackers to breach buildings with locked gates, before detonating explosives, as in the Saint-Quentin-Fallavier attack. ==Causes and motives== According to the American Federal Bureau of Investigation, the tactic has gained popularity because \"Vehicle ramming offers terrorists with limited access to explosives or weapons an opportunity to conduct a homeland attack with minimal prior training or experience.\" Counterterrorism researcher Daveed Gartenstein-Ross of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies told Slate that the tactic has been on the rise in Israel because, \"the security barrier is fairly effective, which makes it hard to get bombs into the country.\" In 2010, Inspire, the online, English-language magazine produced by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula urged mujahideen to choose \"pedestrian only\" locations and make sure to gain speed before ramming their vehicles into the crowd in order to \"achieve maximum carnage\". Vehicle attacks can be carried out by lone-wolf terrorists who are inspired by an ideology, but who are not actually working within a specific political movement or group. Writing for The Daily Beast, Jacob Siegel suggests that the perpetrator of the 2014 Couture-Rouleau attack may be \"the kind of terrorist the West could be seeing a lot more of in the future\", a kind that he describes, following Brian Jenkins of the Rand Corporation, as \"stray dogs\", rather than lone wolves, characterizing them as \"misfits\" who are \"moved from seething anger to spontaneous deadly action\" by exposure to Islamist propaganda. A 2014 propaganda video by ISIL encouraged French sympathizers to use cars to run down civilians. According to Clint Watts, of the Foreign Policy Research Institute, where he is a senior fellow and expert on terrorism, the older model where members of groups like al-Qaeda would \"plan and train together before going to carry out an attack, became defunct around 2005\", due to increased surveillance by Western security agencies. Watts says that Anwar al-Awlaki, the American born al-Qaeda imam, as a key figure in this shift, addressing English-speakers in their own language and urging them to \"Do your own terrorism and stay in place.\" Jamie Bartlett, who heads the Violence and Extremism Program at Demos, a British think tank, explains that \"the internet in the last few years has both increased the possibilities and the likelihood of lone-wolf terrorism,\" supplying isolated individuals with ideological motivation and technique. For authorities in Western countries, the difficulty is that even in a case like that of the perpetrator of the 2014 Couture-Rouleau attack, where Canadian police had identified the attacker, taken away his passport, and were working with his family and community to steer him away from jihad, vehicle attacks can be hard to prevent because, \"it's very difficult to know exactly what an individual is planning to do before a crime is committed. We cannot arrest someone for thinking radical thoughts; it's not a crime in Canada.\" According to Stratfor, the American global intelligence firm, \"while not thus far as deadly as suicide bombing\", this tactic could prove more difficult to prevent. No single group has claimed responsibility for the incidents.Israel: Vehicle Attacks \u2013 A New Militant Tactic?. Stratfor Global Intelligence Experts see a sort of saving grace in the ignorance and incompetence of most lone wolf terrorists, who often manage to murder very few people. Vehicular ramming has sometimes been advocated as a means to deal with protesters who block public roadways in the United States. Two police officers were suspended and fired in January and June 2016, respectively, for tweeting such advice in relation to Black Lives Matter rallies, which have sometimes been broken up by cars. North Dakota state legislator Keith Kempenich tried and failed to pass a law granting civil immunity to drivers who accidentally hit activists, after his mother-in-law was stopped by Dakota Access Pipeline protesters, and Tennessee Senator Bill Ketron did likewise after a man hit an anti-Trump group. Similar legislation has been introduced in Florida and Texas. After the white supremacist Unite the Right rally, in which an anti-fascist protester was killed in a vehicle ramming attack, media outlets Fox News and The Daily Caller deleted videos which encouraged driving through crowds of protesters. In the US, vehicle- ramming attacks are increasingly used by far-right \"White Racially Motivated\" (or \"WRM\") groups and individuals as a terrorist tactic. Vehicles are as easy to acquire as knives, but unlike knives, which may arouse suspicion if found in one's possession, vehicles are perceived as an essential part of modern life. Few consider the deadly and destructive capability of the motor vehicle and its capacity to cause casualties if used aggressively. Pedestrians killed by motor vehicles in the United States numbered 5,977 in 2017, while an estimated 137,000 required emergency room treatment for nonfatal injury inflicted with a vehicle. Vehicle ramming attacks targeting a single individual may be investigated as traffic accidents or manslaughter rather than murder, with reduced penalties and less media coverage. Drivers who commit hit and run crimes may avoid identification and apprehension. Penalties for apprehended drivers vary from one state to another, perhaps only temporary suspension of driving license when the offense is considered a misdemeanor rather than a felony. The protection, anonymity, sense of power, and ease of escape provided by the vehicle lead some motorists to feel safe expressing road rage hostility toward others. ==Protective measures== Houses of Parliament in London, UK. These heavy blocks of concrete are designed to prevent a car bomb or other device being rammed into the building. Concrete blocks in the city centre of Dresden during the 2016 German Unity Day Celebrations On 23 October 2014, the US National Institute of Building Sciences updated its Building Design Guideline on Crash- and Attack-Resistant Models of bollards, a guideline written to help professionals design bollards to protect facilities from vehicle operators, \"who plan or carry out acts of property destruction, incite terrorism, or cause the deaths of civilian, industrial or military populations\". The American Bar Association recommends bollards as effective protection against car ramming attacks.Ernest B. Abbott and Otto J. Hetzel, \"Homeland Security Begins at Home: Local Planning and Regulatory Review to Improve Security\", in Rufus Calhoun Young, Jr. and Dwight H. Merriam, A Legal Guide to Homeland Security and Emergency Management for State and Local Governments, American Bar Association, 2006 Security bollards are credited with minimizing damage and casualties in the 2007 Glasgow Airport attack, and with preventing ramming in the 2014 Alon Shvut stabbing attack, leading the assailant to abandon his car and attack pedestrians waiting at a bus stop with a knife, after his effort to run them over was thwarted. However, Berlin's police chief, Klaus Kandt, argued that bollards would not have prevented the 2016 Berlin truck attack, and that the required security measures would be \"varied, complex, and far from a panacea\". The city of M\u00fcnster has been planning to install security bollards in public areas in response to vehicle-ramming attacks in European cities, including the Berlin attack. While only selected locations can be protected this way, tight bends and restricted-width streets may also prevent a large vehicle getting speed before reaching a barrier. Modern Internet-connected drive-by-wire cars can potentially be hacked remotely and used for such attacks. In 2015, hackers remotely carjacked a Jeep from 10 miles away and drove it into a ditch. Measures for cybersecurity of automobiles to prevent such are often criticized as to being insufficient. ==List of terrorist attacks== In chronological order: * 1981 Iraqi embassy bombing, Beirut, Lebanon (not ramming pedestrians: ramming a specific building then exploding) * 1987 Army camp bombing, Sri Lanka (building ramming and exploding) * 1998 Temple of the Tooth attack, Sri Lanka (building ramming and exploding) * 1999 Ibar Highway assassination attempt, FR Yugoslavia (assassination attempt) * September 11 attacks, planes flown into buildings * 2001 Azor attack, Israel (ramming people, mostly soldiers) * 2001 Jammu and Kashmir legislative assembly car bombing (building gate ramming and exploding and gunfire) * 2002 Lyon car attack, France (building ramming and fire) * 2004 Granby Colorado rampage (modified bulldozer) * 2006 UNC SUV attack, University of North Carolina, United States (ramming people) * 2007 Glasgow International Airport attack, Scotland (building ramming and detonating gas cylinders) * 2008 Kashgar attack, China (ramming people, stabbing, exploding) * 2008 Jerusalem vehicular attack, Israel (ramming vehicles and people) * 2 July 2008 Jerusalem bulldozer attack, Israel (ramming people) * July 22, 2008 Jerusalem bulldozer attack, Israel (ramming people) * 2009 Jerusalem attack, Israel (ramming people) * 2009 Jerusalem bulldozer attack, Israel (ramming people) * 2011 Tel Aviv truck attack, Israel (ramming vehicles and people) * 2011 Tel Aviv nightclub attack, Israel (ramming and stabbing) * 2011 Kashgar attacks, China (ramming people, stabbing, exploding) * May 2013 Murder of Lee Rigby, London, England, (ramming and stabbing) * 2013 Tiananmen Square attack, China (ramming people and bursting into flames) * May 2014 \u00dcr\u00fcmqi attack, China (ramming and throwing bombs off the vehicle) * 2014 Jerusalem tractor attack, Israel (ramming people and bus) * 2014 Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu ramming attack, Canada (ramming) * October 2014 Jerusalem vehicular attack, Israel (ramming people) * November 2014 Jerusalem vehicular attack, Israel (ramming and hitting with a metal crowbar) * 2014 Alon Shvut stabbing attack, West Bank (failed ramming and stabbing) * 2016 Nice truck attack, France (86 killed ramming people and gunfire) * 2016 Ohio State University attack, United States (ramming and stabbing) * 2016 Berlin truck attack, Germany (shooting truck driver and ramming people;
