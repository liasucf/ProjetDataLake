    "text": "Ufford Hall Ufford Hall is a Georgian country house in the village of Ufford, now part of the Borough of Peterborough and traditionally in the county of Cambridgeshire. The Hall is a Grade I listed building. File:Ufford Hall .jpg The house is built of ashlar, the central 5 bays of three storeys with two bay flanking wings on both sides, each of two storeys. At the front is a central pedimented porch with Tuscan columns. The Hall stands in a gravelled courtyard with the entrance fa\u00e7ade facing the village street and with parkland to the rear. ==History== The Hall was built in 1734 for Charles Manners, a younger son of the Duke of Rutland, on land he had bought from his mother. On his death it passed to his brother James who enlarged the original house by adding an extra floor and the flanking wings and also built a stable block. James left the house to his nephew, George Manners, who thereupon sold it by auction. It was bought by William Leigh Symes, owner of a sugar plantation in Jamaica, and later inherited by his son. The latter never occupied the hall and instead it was leased out to a succession of tenants for the next 100 years or so. In 1902 it was bought by Malcolm Wolrych\u2013Whitmore who, on his death in 1940, left it to his nephew, Oliver Kitson, MP. Kitson, the fourth Lord Airedale, lived in the basement and converted the rest of the house into apartments. The stable block became a self-contained dwelling known as Fountain Court. Upon the death of Lord Airedale the Hall passed to the National Trust who sold it on due to its poor physical condition. In 2015 a restoration project began which was completed in 2017 when the Hall returned to private occupation. ==References== Category:Country houses in Cambridgeshire Category:Grade I listed buildings in Cambridgeshire Category:Grade I listed houses ",
