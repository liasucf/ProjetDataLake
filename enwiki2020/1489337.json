This narrow region stretches from Bangkok's outer reaches to the border with Myanmar and from the Shan Hills in the north to Chumphon Province in the south. The geography of the western region is characterised by high mountains and steep river valleys. Western Thailand hosts much of Thailand's less-disturbed forest areas. Water and minerals are important natural resources. The region is home to many of the country's major dams, and mining is an important industry. Many village names in western Thailand rely heavily on the physical geography of the region.Surajitlak Deepadung, Toponyms in the Western Region of Thailand ==Province of western Thailand== According to the six geographical regions established by the National Research Council of Thailand, the western region includes the following provinces: #Kanchanaburi (\u0e01\u0e32\u0e0d\u0e08\u0e19\u0e1a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e35) #Phetchaburi (\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e0a\u0e23\u0e1a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e35) #Prachuap Khiri Khan (\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e08\u0e27\u0e1a\u0e04\u0e35\u0e23\u0e35\u0e02\u0e31\u0e19\u0e18\u0e4c) #Ratchaburi (\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e1a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e35) #Tak (\u0e15\u0e32\u0e01) ==See also== *Regions of Thailand *Tenasserim Hills ==References== Category:Regions of Thailand ",
