    "text": "Eagle County Regional Airport (Vail/Eagle Airport or the Eagle Vail Airport) is in Gypsum, Colorado, United States, 4 miles from Eagle and 37 miles from Vail. It covers and has one runway. The History Channel rated Eagle County Regional Airport as #8 on its list of Most Extreme Airports in July 2010 due to the elevation, weather, approach through mountainous terrain and challenging departure procedures. In 2008-09 the airport completed a runway repaving and extension project, increasing the runway length to 9,000 feet. The airport is largely seasonal, with more scheduled flights in winter. During ski season EGE is the second busiest airport in Colorado after Denver International Airport due to its proximity to Vail and Beaver Creek ski resorts. Some passengers prefer to fly into EGE rather than Aspen since Eagle has lower minimums allowing a better potential to land in bad weather. Despite being advertised as Vail Airport by airlines and other entities, it is a 45-minute drive to Vail via Interstate 70. Flights during summer have become popular with tourists, with United Airlines and American Airlines offering service nearly year-round. The airport is popular with private aircraft operators and has one of the top rated fixed-base operators in the country, the Vail Valley Jet Center.http://vvjc.com/pilots/general-aviation Private jet charter operators include Clay Lacy Aviation,https://www.claylacy.com/contact- us/locations/eagle-county-regional-airport-kege Charter Flight Group,https://charterflightgroup.com/destination_city/aircraft-charter-to- vail-colorado/ Jet Partners,https://jetpartners.aero/airport/eagle-ege/ and Stratos Jet Charters.https://www.stratosjets.com/jet-charter-flights/vail- colorado/ ==Terminal and facilities== EGE's terminal has one concourse with five gates, built in 1996 and remodeled in 2001, 2007, and 2019.

The tower is staffed by SERCO contract air traffic controllers. The airport is building a dedicated de-icing pad so planes do not have to be de-iced on the commercial ramp blocking gates. ==Aircraft procedures== There is no standard published ILS approach at the airport, but there is a special ILS approach, mostly used by the airlines, which requires permission and training from the FSDO. General aviation aircraft usually use the LDA approach, DME, or under VFR. The airport also has an on-site Beacon Interrogator (BI-6) Radar facility.
