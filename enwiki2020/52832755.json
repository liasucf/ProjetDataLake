Asking Snape about himself, Snape tells him a story. Some time before, the Marauders \u2013 James Potter, Remus Lupin, Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew \u2013 were in the same bar celebrating their graduation from Hogwarts. Upon seeing Snape, James challenges him to a duel. Before they all disapparate elsewhere, Lily Evans sees them. They appear on a forest, and James and Snape start dueling. However, Snape eventually becomes victorious, so Remus, Sirius, and Peter join the fight, and they all produce the Fiendfyre spell, creating a big, four headed fire monster, with each head being their animal form. Snape disapparates to elsewhere in the forest, and Remus, Sirius and James do too, while Peter joins them on foot. Using Legilimency, Snape predicts their next attack. However, the Marauders attack him at the same time, eventually having him cornered. Snape, remembering their bullying throughout the years, and Lily, rebounds the spells, applies the Cruciatus Curse to Sirius, and Sectumsempra to Remus. Before cursing Peter, he transforms into a rat and escapes. Snape approaches James and attempts to kill him, but Lily apparates before him, demanding an explanation. Snape apologizes for calling her a mudblood (seen in a flashback in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix). Lily tells Snape that she will forgive him if he changes and stops being with dark wizards, such as Bellatrix Lestrange. Lily disapparates with James, Remus, and Sirius. Returning to the first scene at the bar, the stranger tells Snape that he knows how it feels to be subjugated and feared for one's talents. He then asks Snape to join his ranks. Snape demands to know who the stranger is. The stranger replies, \"You know who.\" == Cast == * Mick Ignis as Severus Snape * Garrett Schweighauser as James Potter * Kevin Allen as Sirius Black * Paul Stanko as Remus Lupin * Zachary David as Peter Pettigrew * Dani Jae as Lily Evans * Clayton Nemrow as Voldemort ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2010s fantasy films Category:2010s thriller films Category:2016 films Category:American fantasy films Category:American films Category:Dark fantasy films Category:English- language films Category:Fan films Category:Italian fantasy films Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films based on children's books Category:Films based on fantasy novels Category:Films set in England Category:Films set in Scotland Category:Films set in the 1970s Category:Harry Potter fandom Category:American independent films Category:Italian films Category:Italian thriller films Category:Films about magic Category:Narcissism in fiction Category:2010s teen fantasy films Category:Films about witchcraft Category:Films about wizards Category:Works based on Harry Potter ",
