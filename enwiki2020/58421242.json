    "text": "Yes, We Fuck! is a Spanish documentary film directed by Antonio Centeno and Ra\u00fal de la Morena in 2015. The title parodies the famous slogan of the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama, yes, we can. == Plot == The documentary explores the sexuality of people with functional diversity. Through six stories, different topics are addressed, including the experience of one's sexuality, life as a couple, prostitution or sexual assistance among others. The use of explicit sexual images aims to break with the hegemonic vision that keeps disabled people in a state of permanent infantilization, showing that not only they have desiring bodies which may also be desirable, but that these bodies can create new political imaginaries that redefine concepts such as masculinity, eroticism or even democracy. == Awards and festivals == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
