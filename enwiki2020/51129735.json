Online edition. doi:10.1080/14772019.2016.1210070. ==Paleobiology== Based on the enlarged temporal fossae and enlarged mandibular canal, Matapanui was probably incapable of lunge-feeding, although it remains unclear whether it could skim- feed or filter prey in the benthic zone. Waharoa shared its habitat with the odontocetes Awamokoa, Austrosqualodon, Otekaikea, and Waipatia, and the mysticetes Horopeta, Mauicetus, Tohoraata, Tokarahia, Waharoa, and Whakakai. == References == Category:Prehistoric cetacean genera Category:Oligocene cetaceans Category:Paleogene Oceania Category:Fossils of New Zealand Category:Fossil taxa described in 2016 ",
