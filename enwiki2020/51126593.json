Count Scaglia lobbied to rebuild the church in his neighborhood, thus reconstruction of a parish church was delayed until 1749, and the design was assigned to the architect Andrea Levis and builder Matteo Ronco. The church we see now was consecrated in 1759. The brick facade has a central projection, marked by an abundance of pilasters, and a rounded marble portal. The roof-line has decorative urns.Comune of Verrua Savoia, entry on parish churches. ==References== Category:Churches in the province of Turin Category:18th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1759 Category:Baroque architecture in Piedmont ",
