His work in India was principally on soil nutrients and fertility. He worked on bacterial nitrogen fixation, green manures and humus. His work on green manure fermentation stimulated the work of R.D. Anstead and Gilbert Fowler. He also worked on other agricultural issues including the pebrine disease of silkworm, bacteriology in indigo fermentation and in the sterilization of water using chlorine. He was also a skilled photographer and his interest in golf made him an advisor for turf management. For his work, he was conferred CIE in 1920. He married Alice Muriel, daughter of J. Walter Leather in 1914. ==References== Category:Agricultural chemists ",
