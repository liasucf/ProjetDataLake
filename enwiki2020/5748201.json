It has since been adopted by the Georgia Research Alliance for other research universities in the U.S. state of Georgia. VentureLab provides comprehensive assistance to Georgia Tech faculty members, research staff and students who want to form startup companies to commercialize the technology innovations they have developed. VentureLab transforms innovations into early- stage companies by assisting in business model development, connecting the innovators with experienced entrepreneurs, locating sources of early-stage financing, and preparing the new companies for the business world.
