    "text": "The State Protection and Guard Service of Moldova (, abbreviated SPPS) is a Moldovan independent government agency and institution which has the duty of protecting government officials, as well as foreign dignitaries, and their relatives. It specifically charged with the protection of President of Moldova during his/her travels. It also provides guards for the headquarters and residences of government agencies. It is very similar to the Protection and Guard Service of Romania. The service's motto is Honor et Fides (Honor and Faith). ==History== The initially entitled Presidential Guard Service was created by order of Moldovan President Mircea Snegur on 27 January 1992. It was organized as an independent sub-unit of the Ministry of National Security (now the Information and Security Service), being directly subordinated to the President of Moldova. On 6 May 1994, the Presidential Guard Service was renamed the Security Service of the President of Moldova before adopting its current name on 28 January 1998. One month later, on 26 February 1998, the service came under the direct control of government. It would serve as a government agency until June 2008 when it was subordinated again to the president. In 2016, the SPPS came under government jurisdiction again.Istoria Serviciului de Protec\u021bie \u0219i Paz\u0103 de Stat a Republicii Moldova, reflectat\u0103 \u00eentr-un DOCUMENTAR de excep\u021bie (VIDEO)Serviciul protec\u0163ie \u015fi paz\u0103 de stat, la 25 de anihttps://www.moldpres.md/en/news/2016/12/22/16010211 ==Missions== The SPPS takes part in activities related to identification, prevention and combating actions which might threaten life and security of state officials.
