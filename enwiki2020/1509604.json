It is developed by Earthlink as part of its Total Access software suite. The unique feature of this application over others in its class is that it is LiveJournal aware, allowing feeds to be entered with the proprietary urls: add a user's journal add all user's friends' journals NewsAccess also filters LiveJournal feeds through the user's cookies to display filtered postings. ==See also== * List of feed aggregators * Comparison of feed aggregators ==References== * Informational site Category:MacOS-only software Category:News aggregators ",
