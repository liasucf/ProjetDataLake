He has represented England at under-16, under-17, under-18 and under-20 level. ==Club career== Lowe came through the Derby County academy, and was an unused substitute for the first team on 2 October 2013, as Derby drew 4\u20134 with Ipswich Town. He went on to turn professional at the club in June 2015. However, he missed much of the 2015\u201316 season with a hamstring injury. He made his professional debut on 23 August 2016, in a 1\u20131 draw with Carlisle United in the second round of the EFL Cup at Pride Park Stadium; he converted his penalty in the resulting shoot- out, which Derby won 14\u201313. On 27 September 2016, Lowe made his League debut in an away game to Cardiff City. Lowe joined League One side Shrewsbury Town on a half-season loan in January 2018. He was then loaned to Scottish Premiership club Aberdeen in August 2018, on a deal which ran until January 2019. After playing in two games for Derby during January, Lowe returned to Aberdeen on loan for the rest of the 2018\u201319 season. ===Sheffield United=== On 7 September 2020, Sheffield United announced the signing of Lowe on a four- year contract. ==International career== Lowe featured in the qualifying round of the 2014 UEFA European Under-17 Championship for the England under-17s, playing in the 6\u20130 win over the Republic of Ireland at the Vazgen Sargsyan Republican Stadium on 29 October 2013. He was called up to the England under-18 team in September 2014 and the England under-20 team in August 2016. In May 2019, Lowe returned to the international fold by being included in the England U20 squad for the 2019 Toulon Tournament. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !rowspan=\"2\"|Division !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|EFL Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Derby County |2016\u201317 |Championship |9||0||1||0||2||0||0||0||12||0 |- |2017\u201318 |Championship |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2018\u201319 |Championship |3||0||1||0||1||0||0||0||5||0 |- |2019\u201320 |Championship |29||0||1||0||1||0||0||0||31||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !41!!0!!3!!0!!4!!0!!0!!0!!48!!0 |- |Shrewsbury Town (loan) |2017\u201318 |League One |12||0||2||0||0||0||2||0||16||0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Aberdeen (loan) |2018\u201319 |Scottish Premiership |16||1||0||0||3||0||0||0||19||1 |- |2018\u201319 |Scottish Premiership |17||1||6||1||0||0||0||0||23||2 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !33!!2!!6!!1!!3!!0!!0!!0!!42!!3 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Sheffield United |2020\u201321 |Premier League |1||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||2||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !87!!2!!11!!1!!8!!0!!2!!0!!108!!3 |} ==Honours== Aberdeen *Scottish League Cup: Runner-up 2018\u201319 Shrewsbury Town *EFL Trophy: Runner-up 2017\u201318 ==References== ==External links== *Profile at Soccerbase *England profile at The FA Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Derby Category:Black English sportspeople Category:English footballers Category:England youth international footballers Category:Association football fullbacks Category:Association football midfielders Category:Derby County F.C. players Category:Shrewsbury Town F.C. players Category:Sheffield United F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:People from South Normanton Category:Aberdeen F.C. players Category:Scottish Professional Football League players Category:Premier League players ",
