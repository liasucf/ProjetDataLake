There are some early historical references to the site \u2013 a church was burned here in 919, while there was a murder in the doorway of another church in 1019. It was burned in 1142, and refounded by the O'Mores. There was a monastic community here as late as 1650. The present fragmentary church has an inserted 15th-century chancel arch \u2013 now blocked up \u2013 leading to the site of the altar. The Round Tower was built in the mid-12th century and is one of the finest in Ireland. Standing 30m high, it is near the centre of the village. The cap was rebuilt in the 19th century, but the tower is otherwise in its original condition. Its doorway, which is high off the ground and faced the doorway of the church, is elaborately decorated in the Romanesque style. It has four orders (rows of decoration receding into the doorway), two inside and two outside, separated by a narrow vaulted lobby. The capitals \u2013 the heads of the pillars of the doorway \u2013 are carved with human heads with intertwining hair. ==References== ==External links== *Timahoe Round Tower Co.
