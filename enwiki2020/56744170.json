    "text": "The Atlantic sixgill shark (Hexanchus vitulus) is a rare species of hexanchid shark found in the Atlantic Ocean. It was formerly described as its own species, but was fused eventually with the bigeye sixgill shark (Hexanchus nakamurai). However, a study published in 2018 resurrected the species on the basis of molecular data. The species can be physically differentiated from the bigeye sixgill by its much smaller size. The Atlantic sixgill shark (Hexanchus vitulus) becomes sexually mature at around 1.40 to 1.75 meters. They do not reach lengths much greater than 180 cm. Springer, S., & Waller, R. A. (1969).
