    "text": "Datel Games 'n' Music, otherwise known as Games 'n' Music or GnM was a mass market Nintendo DS homebrew device sold by Datel at an MSRP of $40. It inserts into the DS card slot and loads games from a MicroSD card. Unlike most flash cartridges (Flashcarts), Games 'n' Music does not officially support playing backup copies of DS game cards in order to showcase a product that is supportive of Nintendo as these backup copies are a major source of dispute within the Nintendo company. It was one of the few flash cartridges available in major American retail stores. Games 'n' Music allows the user to play Movies, Music, and Homebrew applications on the Nintendo DS. It was criticized for its low compatibility with homebrew applications, however, with developments such as DLDI this become a non-issue. The official product description states that the maximum supported MicroSD card size is 2 GB. Some other cards that are compatible; Sandisk, Lexar, and Kingston PNY cards. ==References== ==External links== * Games 'n' Music DLDI Patch Download * Official Website * Official Product Description Category:Nintendo DS homebrew ",
