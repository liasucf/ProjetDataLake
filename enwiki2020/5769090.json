It follows the form's typical rhyme scheme, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. Like other Shakespearean sonnets the poem is composed in a type of poetic metre known as iambic pentameter based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The final line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: \u00d7 / \u00d7 / \u00d7 / \u00d7 / \u00d7 / The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise. (38.14) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. \u00d7 = nonictus. ==Notes== ==Further reading== ==External links== *Analysis Category:British poems Category:Sonnets by William Shakespeare ",
