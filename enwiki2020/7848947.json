    "text": "Aram Asatryan (; 3 March 1953 \u2013 7 November 2006) was an Armenian singer and songwriter of Armenian pop and rabiz music, known for his energetic concerts. == Career == Ever since his childhood years, Aram was recognized as a prodigal musician. In 1985, Asatryan formed his own band. Later in life, he gained fame for his distinct voice and musical styling, and was popular both in Armenia and the international community, particularly the Armenian diaspora . Asatryan loved to work and he devoted his life to music. He approached positive things and was confident about himself. His love for his country, the Armenian people, as well as other ethnic groups are expressed in his songs. During the Nagorno-Karabakh War, he performed songs for the soldiers and Armenians in general to generate moral support. Asatryan performed many concerts internationally (Asia, Europe, Russia, the Middle East), and in many cities in Armenia. He wrote over 500 songs and constantly held world tours. Throughout his life, he received many awards such as the \"Gusan\", which he was awarded on April 18, 2003 by the Cultural Music Ministry in Armenia. == Personal life == Aram Asatryan was born in Ejmiatsin, Armenia, the son of Hapet Asatryan and Ashken Mampreyan. He was born to a refugee family. Until his death, Asatryan resided in the United States. He believed his music would pass on from generation to generation. His son Setrak (Seto) died in a tragic automobile accident approximately one year before Aram's death, which left Aram in a grieving state until his return to Armenia in 2006. ==Death== Aram Asatryan died on 7 November 2006 in Oshakan in the Aragatsotn region from an apparent heart attack. He was at a baptism being the godfather of an Armenian family. He did not show early symptoms of sickness as it was reported that he was in a very good and warm mood. Dying surrounded by his close relatives, he was grieved by fans as he was considered one of the big names in Armenian pop music in modern times, and dubbed the \"voice of Hayastan\". The entire Asatryan family is considered to be a foremost contributor to the pop music of post- Soviet Armenia. His sons, Tigran Asatryan and Artash Asatryan, and his grandson, Grisha Asatryan, continue their father's legacy as popular Armenian musicians. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== *1985 Asum En Heru *1989 Vorkan Tsankatsan *1990 Mer Hayrenik *1991 The Best *1992 Angakh Hayasdan *1993 Music With Duduk *1993 Indz Hamar *1993 Puj Ashkhar *1994 Nayir Ashkharin *1995 Azat Hayasdan *1996 Hye Es Du *1997 The Golden Album *1998 Los Angeles *1998 Super Dance *1999 Yet Dardzek Tariner *1999 10 Tari Bemum *1999 2000 *2000 Ashkharoum Inchkan Hay Ka, Aynkan El Ka Yerevan *2000 Millennium *2000 Re Mi X *2000 The Very Best *2001 Asem Te Casem *2001 Im Yerke *2002 Skizb *2002 Urakh Tsragir *2003 Du Ashkhar Ekar *2005 Anund *2006 My Sons ===Live albums=== *2005 Live Concert in Armenia ===Compilation albums=== *2002 Sweet Memory\u2019s *2003 50 Years *2003 The Best Of Aram Asatryan ==References== == External links == * Aram Asatryan - Aram Asatryan Online Music Playlist * Death * a1plus death report * * Aram Asatryan Music Videos Category:1953 births Category:2006 deaths Category:People from Vagharshapat Category:Armenian male singers Category:20th-century Armenian singers Category:20th-century male singers ",
