He was a member of the Nkanga branch of the Kimpanzu house.Thornton, John. 2000. \u201cMbanza Kongo/Sao Salvador: Kongo's Holy City\u201d in Africa's Urban Past (eds.) David Anderson and Richard Rathbone. Oxford: James Currey Ltd. Page 76 ==Rule== The electors chose \u00c1lvaro XIII to rule, but his cousin, Pedro V, contested the throne. Pedro was expelled from the capital city, S\u00e3o Salvador, where he sought the assistance of the Portuguese, who had recently occupied Bembe, located to the south of his core domains. In order to obtain this aid, Pedro swore vassalage to Portugal, the first Kongo king ever to do so. With Portuguese assistance, he was able, after a long struggle, to capture S\u00e3o Salvador and drive \u00c1lvaro off the throne.Thornton, \"Master or Dupe?\" pp. 119-21. ==References== Category:Manikongo of Kongo ",
