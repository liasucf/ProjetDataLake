Erayokan won the 400 m at the 18th Nigerian National Sports Festival in 2012 ahead of Abbas Abubakar and Gerald Odeka. He represented his country at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, running in the 4 x 400 m. He also represented Nigeria at the 2015 IAAF World Relays. 2015 seemed a breakthrough year for Erayokan. Erayokan was selected for the individual 400 m at the Brazzaville African Games. He had only previously been in the relay pool at international competitions. At the Brazzaville African Games, he went under 46 s for the first time in his career, running 45.84 in the heats. He bettered that in the semifinal with a sub 45 s clocking of 44.95 s, earning him a spot in the final. In the final, he finished 6th in 45.73 s. He was selected to represent Nigeria at the Portland Indoor Championships. He however did not run because he arrived Portland too close to the start of the 400 m heats. He also competed at the 2016 African Championships in Durban but did not make the final. == References == == External links == * * All-Athletics profile -- Erayokan Orukpe Category:Living people Category:1993 births Category:Nigerian male sprinters Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2014 Commonwealth Games Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2018 Commonwealth Games Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for Nigeria Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2015 African Games Category:Sportspeople from Edo State Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2016 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic athletes of Nigeria ",
