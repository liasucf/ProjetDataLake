It is located at the junction of the N55 National secondary road and the R392 regional road.https://www.longfordleader.ie/section/654/ballymahon ==History== Ballymahon derives its name from the Irish language term Baile U\u00ed Mhath\u00e1in or Baile Mathuna, meaning \"Town of Mahon\". This may refer to Mahon (Mathgamain mac Cenn\u00e9tig), a southern chieftain and the elder brother of Brian Boru, who is believed by some to have fought a battle in 960 in the vicinity of Ballymahon at Shrule (in Irish Sruaith Fhuil, River of Blood) where he defeated O'Rourke of Cavan and laid claim to lands in the area. This is disputed by others who claim Mahon may relate to a sub chieftain of the O'Farrells who ruled over this part of County Longford in the 14th century. The earliest documentary evidence of Ballymahon is from the year 1578, when lands in the area were granted to the Dillon family, later Earls of Roscommon. By 1654, the maps of William Petty's Down Survey shows Ballymahon as a group of houses situated at the southern end of the present town, on the right bank of the River Inny. Two main families, the Shuldham family of Moigh House and the King-Harman family of Newcastle House, developed the town in the mid- nineteenth century. The buildings in the town are of late Georgian architecture, with two and three-storey gabled houses, colour-washed and in rows of three and four. From 1788 to 1853, the Roman Catholic bishops of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise resided in the town, and the parish church served as a Pro-Cathedral until St Mel's Cathedral was built in Longford.

A stretch of the Inny from Newcastle Bridge to Ballymahon town is used for beginner to intermediate kayaking, canoeing and time trials. The Royal Canal also passes westwards through Ballymahon from Dublin to Clondra, County Longford. Following extensive works the canal has been restored and is now fully navigable. Brannigan Harbour, c.1 km from Ballymahon town, is on the Royal Canal and is a common point for boats and barges to stop and pass. ==Buildings of note== * Ballymahon Courthouse and Market House, originally built in the early 19th century, is a community library. It is situated in the centre of the town (built 1819). * St Catherine's Church with its narrow spire is a prominent feature in the town (built 1800, rebuilt 1824) * Ballymahon Mill, now converted into apartments, is a six-storey building on the southern end of the town and adjacent to the town's bridge and River Inny (built 1839) * St Matthew's Church is a Gothic- style Church which is located on the northwest side of Ballymahon (built 1906) * Other buildings of interest in the area include: Newcastle House (built between 1710 and 1860), Castlecore House (built between 1740\u201365), Ledwithstown House (built 1746), the Bank of Ireland Building (built 1869), and the Convent of Mercy (built 1882) * Opposite St Catherine's Church is the old RIC police barracks built on the northern edge of what local tradition holds was a castle or fortress of the O'Farrell Clan, earthworks of which can still be seen off the Fairgreen/Thomand Lodge Road. It is said to have been originally built as a hospital. It became a Garda barracks after the establishment of the Irish Free State and remained in service until 1996 when a new, smaller, station was built on the southern bank of the river opposite the old mill. The barracks was attacked during the War of Independence in August 1920. The attack was led by General Se\u00e1n MacEoin, Se\u00e1n Connolly (who fired the first shot in the Easter Rising, killing an unarmed sentry, Constable O'Brien, outside Dublin Castle, and was later killed himself in the Selton Hill ambush) and Frank Davis. A small party of local volunteers also took part in the raid which mainly aimed to seize firearms. MacEoin later visited the barracks to campaign during an election campaign in the 1950s. Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh was held here in the 1950s during the IRA Border War which ended in 1962. ==Transport and communications== River Inny at Newcastle Bridge Ballymahon is on the N55 road, a National Secondary route leading from Athlone, about 22 kilometres to the south, towards Belfast and Northern Ireland. The county town of Longford lies about 22 kilometres to the north-west. The R392 road links Ballymahon to Mullingar in the East and to Roscommon in the West, via Lanesborough\u2013Ballyleague. This route was a portion of an ancient ceremonial way from Rathcroghan to the Hill of Tara. Intact portions of the ancient roadway can be seen at the nearby Corlea Trackway and the ceremonial route attests to the straightness of the R392.
