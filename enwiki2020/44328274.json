His father Pothuval brings a marriage proposal for him with Aswathi (Sangita). She is a nurse and for that reason Achuthankutty insults her without seeing her before her father. He gets a job as peon in the same town where Aswathi works. Achuthankutty's superior is Sunderashan (Jagathy Sreekumar). Sunderashan is fed up with his feminist and arrogant wife Chandrika (KPAC Lalitha) and they fight. Chandrika and Aswathy are friends and they find out about Achuthankutty. Chandrika tells Aswathy that she should take revenge on Achuthankutty. They trick him into believing that she is an Air hostess. Chandrika makes Achuthankutty fall for the trick and he himself introduces to her as a Bank Manager and marries her. Aswathi has now thrown her life for revenge and Achuthankutty on a fool's paradise.
