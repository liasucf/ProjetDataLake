He has invented new aviation innovations to be mounted on his company's aircraft. The owners of Globe Air Corporation, a rival aviation company, are after these new inventions. Their president, William Craft (Robert Walker), hires a masked and mysterious airman, known only as \"Pilot X\", who also makes plans to steal those inventions for his own use. He uses a trained monkey to steal one of them, a radio-controlled \"flying torpedo\", that was in engineer Baker's workshop. In the air, his gang of \"Air Hawks\" pose serious peril to the Baker Aircraft Company. The attacks are largely aimed at stealing Baker's exclusive rights to the \"Aerometer\", invented by James B. Joyce (C. H. Allen), a new navigational instrument that makes flying safer in all sorts of weather, even at night. The inventor's daughter, Shirley (Eugenia Gilbert), is an aviatrix who is Baker's fianc\u00e9e. \"World-famous aviatrix\" Fawn Nesbitt (Dorothy Talcott), who hopes to become the first female pilot to fly around the world, becomes concerned when Baker's aircraft begin crashing. She is to be married to Albert Orren (Eugene Burr), the owner of a rival aircraft company. As the air attacks mount, Baker and Shirley are in constant danger, both on the ground and above the clouds. Their efforts always seem to be known to the mysterious Pilot X, and suspicion falls on Perkins (Arthur Morrison), Joyce's butler, who is always nearby when plans are being discussed. ==Chapter titles== # The Winged Avenger (16 minutes) # The Sky Writer (20 minutes) # The Girl Who Flew Alone (20 minutes) # The Smoke Screen (20 minutes) # Test Flight (20 minutes) # The Hawk's Nest (20 minutes) # The Faker Pilot (20 minutes) # The Air Raft (20 minutes) # The Hidden Hangar (20 minutes) # Mystery Pilot X (20 minutes) ==Cast== * Walter Miller as Jack Baker * Eugenia Gilbert as Shirley Joyce * Robert Walker as William Craft * Eugene Burr as Albert Orren * Dorothy Tallcot as Fawn Nesbitt * James A.
