    "text": "This is a list of Filipino Twenty20 International cricketers. In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Philippines and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will have T20I status. This list comprises all members of the Philippines cricket team who have played at least one T20I match. It is initially arranged in the order in which each player won his first Twenty20 cap. Where more than one player won his first Twenty20 cap in the same match, those players are listed alphabetically by surname. ==Key== {| |- | valign=\"top\" style=\"width:26%\" | General * \u2013 Captain * \u2013 Wicket-keeper * First \u2013 Year of debut * Last \u2013 Year of latest game * Mat \u2013 Number of matches played | valign=\"top\" style=\"width:25%\" | Batting * Runs \u2013 Runs scored in career * HS \u2013 Highest score * Avg \u2013 Runs scored per dismissal * * \u2013 Batsman remained not out * 50 \u2013 Half-centuries scored | valign=\"top\" style=\"width:25%\" | Bowling * Balls \u2013 Balls bowled in career * Wkt \u2013 Wickets taken in career * BBI \u2013 Best bowling in an innings * Ave \u2013 Average runs per wicket | valign=\"top\" style=\"width:24%\" | Fielding * Ca \u2013 Catches taken * St \u2013 Stumpings affected |} ==List of players== :Statistics are correct as of 24 March 2019.Players / Philippines / T20I caps \u2013 ESPNcricinfo.
