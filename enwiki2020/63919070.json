    "text": "A hydridonitride (nitridohydride, nitride hydride, or hydride nitride) is a chemical compound that contains hydride and nitride ions in a single phase. These compounds are distinct from inorganic amides and imides as the hydrogen does not share a bond with nitrogen, and contain a larger proportion of metals. ==Structure== The hydride ion H\u2212 is stabilised by being surrounded by electropositive elements such as alkalis or alkaline earths. Quaternary compounds exist where nitrogen forms a complex with bonds to a transition or main group element. The hydride requires the presence of another alkaline earth element. ==Production== Hydridonitrides may be produced by a process called self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) where a metal nitride is ignited in a hydrogen atmosphere. A metal (Ti, Zr, Hf, Y) can also be ignited in an atmosphere mixing hydrogen and nitrogen, and a hydridonitride is formed exothermicly. The molten metal flux technique involves dissolving metal nitrides and hydrides in an excess of molten alkaline earth metal, by heating till everything is molten, and then cooling until crystals form, but the metal is still liquid. Draining the liquid metal (and centrifuging) leaves the crystals of hydridonitride behind. A eutectic molten metal allows it to be cooled more. If liquid alkali metal is used as a flux to grow a hydridonitride crystal, excess metal can be removed using liquid ammonia. ==Properties== Some hydridonitride are sensitive to water vapour in air. For non-stoichimetric compounds, as the proportion of hydrogen increases, the unit cell dimensions also increase, so hydrogen is not merely filling holes. When heated to a sufficiently high temperature, hydridonitrides lose hydrogen first to form a metallic nitride or alloy. ==List== {|class=\"wikitable\" !name !formula !system !space group !unit cell (lengths in \u00c5, volume in \u00c53) !structure !comment !optical !reference |- |lithium nitride hydride lithium hydridonitride |Li4NH |tetrahedral |I41/a |a = 4.9865, c = 9.877, V = 234.9, Z = 4 | | |yellow | |- |calcium hydridonitride |Ca2NH |cubic |Fd3m |a = 10.13, Z = 16 | | |brown-black | |- |strontium hydridonitride |Sr2NH | |R'm |a = 3.870, c = 18.958 | | |orange-yellow or black | |- |barium hydridonitride |Ba2NH |hexagonal |R'm |a = 4.0262, c = 20.469 | |pure H\u2212 conductor | | |- |Titanium hydridonitride |TiN0.3H1.1 | | | | | | | |- | |Ti0.6Nb0.4N0.4H1.1 | | | | | | | |- |zirconium hydridonitride |ZrN0.17H1.65 | | | | | | | |- | |Ti0.88Zr0.12N0.28H1.39 | | | | | | | |- | |Zr0.7Nb0.3N0.33H1.15 | | | | | | | |- | |Ti0.7V0.3N0.23H0.8 | | | | | | | |- |Hafnium hydridonitride |HfNH0.6 |hcp | |a = 3.241, c = 5.198 | | | | |- |Hafnium hydridonitride |HfNH |hcp | |a = 3.216, c = 5.259 | | | | |- |Thorium nitride hydride |ThNH2 |fcc | |a = 5.596 | | | | |- |Lithium distrontium dihydride nitride |LiSr2H2N |orthorhombic |Pnma |a = 7.4714, b = 3.7028, c = 13.2986, Z = 4 |[SrH5N2]9\u2212, [SrH4N3]11\u2212, [LiH3N]5\u2212 | | | |- |hexacalcium dichromium hexanitride hydride |Ca6Cr2N6H | |R |a = 9.0042, c = 9.1898, Z = 3 |planar CrN36\u2212, CrN35\u2212, octahedral Ca6H11+ | | | |- | |Ba3CrN3H |hexagonal |P63/m |a = 8.0270, c = 5.6240, Z = 2 |planar CrN35\u2212; octahedral Ba6H11+ | | | |- |tricalcium silicon trinitride hydride |Ca3SiN3H |monoclinic |C2/c |a = 5.236, b = 10.461, c = 16.389, \u03b2 = 91.182\u00b0, Z = 8 |SiN4 tetrahedra in chains, Ca6H octahedra | | | |- |Lithium dieuropium nitride trihydride |LiEu2NH3 |orthorhombic |Pnma |a = 7.4213, b = 3.6726, c = 13.1281, Z = 4 |[Eu3+H7N2]10\u2013 and [Eu2+H6N3]13\u2013 | |ruby red | |- |} ==References== Category:Nitrides Category:Hydrides Category:Mixed anion compounds ",
