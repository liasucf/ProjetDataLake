    "text": "Diplacodes haematodes, the scarlet percher, is a species of dragonfly in the family Libellulidae. It occurs throughout Australia (except Tasmania), Timor, New Guinea, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia. It is locally common in habitats with hot sunny exposed sites at or near rivers, streams, ponds, and lakes. It often prefers to settle on hot rocks rather than twigs or leaves, and is quite wary. This is a spectacular species of dragonfly, although small in size (wingspan 60mm, length 35mm). The male is brilliant red, the female yellow-ochre. Females have yellow infuscation suffusing the outer wings, while the males have similar colour at the bases of the wings. ==Gallery== A mating pair of Diplacodes haematodes 3493.jpg|Male and female mating File:30 Days of Gratitude- Day 19 (3042511541).jpg|Red File:Dragonfly Diplacodes haematodes f Mareeba130404-4583.jpg|Mature Female Female Scarlet Percher face (12008570286).jpg|Female face on Male Scarlet Percher flank (16386434002).jpg|Male wings have colour near their base File:Diplacodes haematodes.jpg|Male File:Scarlet Percher perching on stick (6402054619).jpg|Immature male before turning red File:Diplacodes haematodes female.jpg|Female, highlighting brownish wingtips File:Diplacodes haematodes wing venation.jpg|Male, highlighting wing venation File:Diplacodes haematodes wing diagram 1216.svg|Diagram of male wings Diplacodes haematodes female wings (34248712983).jpg|Photo of female wings ==References== Category:Libellulidae Category:Odonata of Oceania Category:Odonata of Australia Category:Insects of Timor Category:Taxa named by Hermann Burmeister Category:Insects described in 1839 ",
