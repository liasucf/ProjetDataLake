    "text": "The Liberty Hill School at Liberty Hill, near Fairview, Tennessee, was built c. 1915. Along with Forest Hills School and Liberty School, as of 1988 it was considered one of the three best surviving examples in Williamson County of one room schoolhouses built during 1900\u20131920. Most of these schools, which once provided the majority of public education in the county, had been lost. The school and a property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988, at which time the school was vacant and used for hay storage. with ==References== Category:School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Tennessee Category:Buildings and structures in Williamson County, Tennessee Category:School buildings completed in 1915 Category:One- room schoolhouses in Tennessee Category:National Register of Historic Places in Williamson County, Tennessee ",
