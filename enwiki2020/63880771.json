    "text": "Eminem 1999 Eminem is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He is considered to be one of the greatest hip hop artists of all time. His success and acclaimed pieces of work during his height of fame in the early 2000s was recognized for breaking racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. Being highly successful in an art form developed by African Americans and Hispanic and Latino Americans, Eminem's reception as one of the greatest rappers of all time has made him hugely important in 21st century popular music. Rolling Stone ranked Eminem 83rd on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and 91st on its list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time. In 2011, Eminem was called the \"King of Hip-Hop\" by Rolling Stone, based on analyzed album sales, chart positions, YouTube views, social media, concert grosses, industry awards and critical ratings of solo rappers who released music from 2009 to the first half of 2011. ==Influences== Eminem has cited several MCs as influencing his rapping style, including Esham, Kool G Rap, Masta Ace, Big Daddy Kane, Newcleus, Ice-T, Mantronix, Melle Mel (on \"The Message\"), LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, Run\u2013D.M.C., Rakim, DMX, Jadakiss, Nas, Raekwon and Boogie Down Productions. In How to Rap, Guerilla Black notes that Eminem studied other MCs to hone his rapping technique: \"Eminem listened to everything and that's what made him one of the greats\". In the book, other MCs also praise aspects of his rapping technique; varied, humorous subject matter, connecting with his audience, carrying a concept over a series of albums, complex rhyme schemes, bending words so they rhyme, multisyllabic rhymes, many rhymes to a bar, complex rhythms, clear enunciation and the use of melody and syncopation. Eminem is known to write most of his lyrics on paper (documented in The Way I Am), taking several days or a week to craft lyrics, being a \"workaholic\" and \"stacking\" vocals. Examples of hip hop subgenres that Eminem's music has been described as include horrorcore, comedy hip hop, and hardcore hip hop. Eminem also incorporates rap rock into his music and has cited rock acts during the 1970s and 1980s, such as Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin, as influences in his music. ==Artists influenced by Eminem== :This list is incomplete, you can help Wikipedia by expanding it with reliable references. *50 Cent *Ab-Soul *Alec Benjamin *Asher Roth *B.o.B *Big Sean *BlocBoy JB *BTS *Bubba Sparxxx *Camila Cabello *Chance the Rapper *Chanyeol *Charles Hamilton *Chris Webby *Cordae *Danny Brown *Earl Sweatshirt *Ed Sheeran *Emiway Bantai *Frank Ocean *Hollywood Undead *Hopsin *J.
