    "text": "A depiction of Ellegua Elegua (Yoruba: \u00c8\u1e63\u00f9-\u1eb8l\u1eb9\u0301gb\u00e1ra, also spelled Eleggua; known as Elegu\u00e1 in Latin America and Spanish-speaking Caribbean islands) is an Orisha, a deity of roads in the religions of Santeria (Santer\u00eda), Umbanda, Quimbanda, and Candombl\u00e9. He is syncretized with Saint Michael, Saint Anthony of Padua, or the Holy Child of Atocha. == In Africa == Elegua is known as \u00c8\u1e63\u00f9- \u1eb8l\u1eb9\u0301gb\u00e1ra in the Yoruba religion and is closely associated with Eshu. \u1eb8l\u1eb9\u0301gb\u00e1ra means the \"master of force\" in the Yoruba language. == Santer\u00eda == Elegu\u00e1 is known in Cuba and Puerto Rico as the orisha and \"owner\" of caminos, or roads and paths. All ceremonies and rituals in Santer\u00eda must first have the approval of Elegu\u00e1 before progressing. He is the messenger of Olofi. Within the \"Regla de Ocha\" [Cuba], he slightly differs from Echu, who in this case is seen as his brother, by having less dangerous and less aggressive characteristics. Elegu\u00e1 moves silently; in contrast, Echu \"breaks through\". Manifestations of Elegu\u00e1 includes Akefun, Aleshujade, Arabobo, Awanjonu, Lalaf\u00e1n, Obas\u00edn, Oparicocha, and Osokere. There is a patak\u00ed (story) in Santer\u00eda in which Olodumare gives Elegu\u00e1 the keys to the past, present, and future; for this reason, Elegu\u00e1 is often depicted holding a set of keys. A figure of Elegu\u00e1 may be placed in the house behind the entrance door. ==In Brazil== In Afro-Brazilian religion Elegbara is one of the titles of Exu. == See also == * Papa Legba ==References== == External links == * Santeria cubana :: Tratado de Eshu-Elegbara * Santeria.fr :: All About Eleggua * Santeria.fr :: Todo Sobre Eleggua * Santeria.fr :: Tout sur les Eleggua Category:Traditional African religions Category:Yoruba deities Category:Yoruba mythology Category:Brazilian deities Category:Crossroads mythology Category:Liminal deities Category:Trickster gods Category:Santer\u00eda ",
