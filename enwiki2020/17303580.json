On 5 January 2008, Waghef was elected as President of ADIL, a party that was formed to support Abdallahi, at the end of the party's constitutive congress.\"Formation du parti de la majorit\u00e9 \"Adel\" (Ere Nouvelle de la D\u00e9mocratie et du D\u00e9veloppement) et \u00e9lection de ses instances provisoires\", Agence Mauritanienne d'Information, 5 January 2008 . Prime Minister Zeine Ould Zeidane resigned on 6 May 2008, and Abdallahi appointed Waghef to succeed him on the same day. Following consultations with majority and opposition parties regarding the formation of the new government, the opposition Union of the Forces of Progress (UFP) announced on 9 May that it intended to participate in Waghef's government;\"L'UFP d\u00e9cide de participer au gouvernement\", AMI, 9 May 2008 . the opposition National Coalition for Reform and Development (Tewassoul) also announced that it had decided to participate in the government on 10 May.\"Le parti \"Tewassoul\" annonce sa participation au gouvernement\", AMI, 10 May 2008 . However, the President of the Rally of Democratic Forces (RFD), Ahmed Ould Daddah, said on 7 May that the RFD\u2014the main opposition party\u2014would not participate;\"Le RFD d\u00e9cide de ne pas participer au futur gouvernement\", AMI, 9 May 2008 . the President of the Alliance for Justice and Democracy/Movement for Renewal, Ibrahima Moctar Sarr, also said on 10 May that his party would not participate due to policy differences.\"L'AJD/MR annonce qu'il ne participera au nouveau gouvernement\", AMI, 10 May 2008 . On 11 May, Waghef's government was named; it had 30 members, including 24 ministers,\"Mauritanie: formation d'un gouvernement de 30 membres dont 4 de l'opposition\", AFP (Jeuneafrique.com), 11 May 2008 .\"D\u00e9signation du nouveau gouvernement\", AMI, 11 May 2008 . and 12 of its members had previously served under Zeidane. Members of ADIL accounted for almost two-thirds of Waghef's government and held most of the key ministries. Four members of the government were from the two opposition parties which decided to participate. On 30 June 2008, 39 deputies in the National Assembly (out of a total of 95) filed a motion of censure against Waghef's government.\"Le Parlement mauritanien menac\u00e9 de dissolution\", African Press Agency, 2 July 2008 .\"Mauritanian government quits before voting on censure motion\", AFP, 3 July 2008. Most of these deputies were from ADIL, although the RFD (the main opposition party) also declared its support for the censure motion. The deputies complained that Waghef's government had not presented a program and that too many positions in the government had been given to opposition parties and to figures who had served under President Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya. 24 senators declared that they were in \"unconditional solidarity\" with the deputies who filed the censure motion.\"Des membres du S\u00e9nat se d\u00e9clarent solidaires des d\u00e9put\u00e9s oeuvrant pour faire aboutir une motion de censure contre le gouvernement\", AMI, 1 July 2008 . President Abdallahi, speaking on 2 July, called on the deputies to reconsider.\"Le pr\u00e9sident de la r\u00e9publique adresse un discours \u00e0 la nation\", AMI, 2 July 2008 . He said that the motion was surprising because it was initiated by deputies belonging to the party that headed the government, and also because the government's program had not even been presented yet. In addition, Abdallahi argued that Waghef's government was so new that there had not been enough time to properly evaluate its performance, and he warned that he might dissolve the National Assembly if the censure motion was adopted. Before the censure motion could be voted on, Waghef and his government resigned on 3 July in order \"to preserve the cohesion of the majority which supports [Abdallahi's] programme\"; he urged unity and dialogue among ADIL and the presidential majority. Waghef was reappointed by Abdallahi on the same day. The deputies who supported the censure motion described the resignation and reappointment as a positive step and said that the composition of the next government should properly reflect the results of the previous election.\"Initiative en faveur de la motion de censure: satisfaction pour le d\u00e9veloppement des \u00e9v\u00e8nements\", AMI, 4 July 2008 . Waghef said following his reappointment on 3 July that he wanted to form a government of \"broad consensus\".\"Le Premier ministre mauritanien promet un gouvernement de large consensus\", Xinhua (Jeuneafrique.com), 3 July 2008 . An opposition coalition composed of a dozen parties denounced Waghef's reappointment on 7 July.\"Une coalition de l'opposition exige le limogeage du Premier ministre mauritanien\", Xinhua (Jeuneafrique.com), 7 July 2008 . On 8 July, Waghef announced that no opposition parties would be included in the new government, thereby excluding the UFP and Tawassoul.\"Les islamistes mauritaniens restent dans la majorit\u00e9 malgr\u00e9 leur exclusion du futur gouvernement\", African Press Agency, 9 July 2008 . The new government was named on 15 July;\"Composition du nouveau gouvernement\", AMI, 15 July 2008 .\"Formation d'un gouvernement sans les partis de l'opposition\", AFP (Jeuneafrique.com), 16 July 2008 . there were 30 members of this government, including 12 who were new to the government. No members of the opposition were included in this government, and the ministers associated with Taya were also excluded. On 4 August 2008, 25 of ADIL's 49 deputies in the National Assembly, along with 24 of its 45 senators, announced that they were leaving the party, thereby depriving it of its parliamentary majority.\"Le parti au pouvoir en Mauritanie perd sa majorit\u00e9 au parlement\", African Press Agency, 4 August 2008 . ===2008 coup d'etat=== On 6 August 2008, Waghef was arrested in a military coup d'\u00e9tat along with Abdallahi and the interior minister. The coup plotters were top security forces who had been fired by Abdallahi earlier in the day; these included General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, General Muhammad Ould Al-Ghazwani, General Philippe Swikri, and Brigadier General (Aqid) Ahmad Ould Bakri.themedialine.org, Generals Seize Power in Mauritanian Coup Member of parliament Mohammed Al Mukhtar claimed popular support for the coup, saying that Abdallahi behaved in an \"authoritarian\" manner and \"marginalized the majority in parliament.\"\"Renegade army officers stage coup in Mauritania\", Associated Press, 6 August 2008.

A few hours later, Waghef spoke before a rally of thousands of people and expressed defiance toward the junta, saying that Mauritanians did not accept its rule and urging the people to continue struggling to restore Abdallahi to power. Moulaye Ould Mohamed Laghdaf was appointed as Prime Minister by junta leader Abdel Aziz on 14 August, but Waghef said at a news conference on the same day that this appointment was \"illegal\" and that the government he had headed was still the legitimate government.\"Mauritanian junta names new PM\", AFP, 14 August 2008. Waghef said in an interview with Abu Dhabi TV on 20 August that President Abdallahi had dismissed the senior officers because they had already been planning to seize power on 9 August.\"Ousted Mauritanian prime minister re-arrested\", AFP, 21 August 2008. He subsequently travelled to Nouadhibou in northern Mauritania in order to participate in an anti-coup protest there, but was arrested upon arrival on 21 August 2008.\"Mauritanian former PM re- arrested\", Xinhua, 21 August 2008. He was reportedly arrested because he left Nouakchott without the junta's permission. On 22 August, it was announced that he was being taken to his home village of Achram, where he would be kept under house arrest. According to Minister of Decentralization Yahya Ould Kebd, the junta sought to \"rein in his activism\", saying that \"his contact with the outside will probably be limited but not banned\".\"Mauritanian PM to be kept under house arrest\", AFP, 22 August 2008. In November 2008, Waghef and four others were charged with intentionally bankrupting Air Mauritanie while Waghef was its Director-General. In early December, bail for Waghef and his co- defendants was set at 100 million ouguiyas; this was reportedly the highest level of bail ever set by a court in Mauritania. Waghef was also charged with corruption in a case involving spoiled food; the bail set in that case was five million ouguiyas.\"Bail set for release of deposed Mauritanian premier\", AFP, 7 December 2008. Dozens of protesters called for Waghef's release in a demonstration near the Supreme Court on 29 April 2009. The police broke up the protest.\"Police break up Mauritanian anti-coup protest\", AFP, 29 April 2009. Subsequently, in negotiations between the junta and the opposition, the opposition demanded Waghef's release as a condition for an agreement. After a deal was reached, the junta released Waghef on 4 June 2009.
