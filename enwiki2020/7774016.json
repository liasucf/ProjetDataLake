    "text": "Borgohain (Ahom language: Chao Thao Lung) was the second of the two original counselors in the Ahom kingdom. He was selected by the Ahom king from members of the Ahom nobility (Satgharia Ahom), who was not eligible for the position of Ahom kingship. The other original counsellor is the Burhagohain. Both the positions existed from the time of the first Ahom king, Sukaphaa. After the first major expansion of the Ahom kingdom, the Sadiya province was initially given to the Borgohain to administer. \"Borgohain and Buragohain were given the charge of Sadiya and Dihing province respectively.\" But later in the year 1527, he was replaced by King-lun Buragohain who was made Thao-mung Bo- ngen(Sadiyakhowa Gohain). \"Shenlung King-lun was made Thao-mung Bo- ngen(Sadiya-khowa Gohain) in Lakni Rungrao 1527 and offered the rule between the source of Lohit and Kangkham.\" After that, he was given the region south of the Dikhow river to Koliabor on the south bank. In later times, he administered the region east of Burai on the north bank, \"The Buragohain ruled over the territory extending from Sadiya in the east to river Gerelua in the west on the north bank of the Brahmaputra river.\" as Borbarua was given the charge of territories between Sadiya province to Kaliabor. \"The Borbarua was the chief executive officer of the state exercising his power from Sadiya to Koliabor in Upper Assam.\" ==List of Borgohains== * Thao Mong Kang Ngan * Ta- Phi-Khun * Ta-Ph-Kun * Tya-Tan-Bin * Phra-Sheng-Mong Thao Luong * Kali-Kham * Ton-Kham Thao Luong * Kham-Shen Thao Luong * Khampet Thao Luong * Guimela Thao Luong * Piling Thao Luong * Leshai Thao Luong * Banrukia Langisong Thao Luong * Sengmun Thao Luong * Laluk Thao Luong * Jabang Thao Luong * Madurial Laithapana Thao Luong * Kamalakanta Thao Luong * Harinath Thao Luong * Thanunath Thao Luong * Dihingia Khamchang Thao Luong * Khamcheng Thao Luong * Numali Brogohain * Madurial Barjana Thao Luong * Bailung Thao Luong * Madurial Bishnunarayan Thao Luong * Madurial Nirbhoynarayan Thao Luong * Gangaram Thao Luong * Narahari Thao Luong ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * Category:Ahom kingdom Category:Assamese-language surnames ",
