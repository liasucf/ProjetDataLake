He also represents the Puerto Rican national team. He played college basketball for the University of South Carolina before being selected with the 20th overall pick of the 2006 NBA draft by the New York Knicks. After spending six seasons with the New York Knicks and Denver Nuggets in the National Basketball Association (NBA), he played since the 2012\u201313 season in several leagues around the world, among which are Philippine Basketball Association (PBA), Asean Basketball League (ABL) , Mexican LNBP, Venezuelan LPB and NBA G League. ==Early life and education== Balkman was born in Staten Island, New York, and prior to attending Laurinburg Institute, he was at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida. At Laurinburg, he led his team to 40\u20132 record and No. 1 national prep school ranking. ==College career== ===Recruitment=== Balkman was a little known player in high school at the Laurinburg Institute, but he was discovered in 2002 by University of South Carolina head coach Dave Odom, who instantly saw his potential. According to Odom, \"I remember the first time I saw Renaldo Balkman. I was sitting in Orlando in a gym with (South Carolina assistant coach) Barry Sanderson and I asked him 'who is that kid with the dreadlocks? That's the guy we need'. He came back and said nobody knows his name.\"Odom Reflects on Renaldo Balkman the day after Balkman was recruited and signed by Carolina, having received little to no interest from any other major basketball programs. ===Playing career=== Balkman played an integral role in South Carolina's two wins over eventual national champion Florida during the 2005\u201306 college basketball season. He was also the 2006 NIT Most Valuable Player, averaging 9.6 points, 6.3 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 1.7 steals and 1.3 blocks per game.South Carolina Gamecocks Statistics \u2013 2005\u201306 Balkman's highlight for the season was a team-leading 28-point, 16-rebound, 4-steal performance in a 67\u201356 win over Alabama on February 14, 2006. He was 11 of 15 from the field and also had a team-high 2 blocks.South Carolina 67, Alabama 56 \u2013 Recap \u2013 February 14, 2006 For Balkman, a defensive banger whose style Knicks general manager Isiah Thomas had likened to Dennis Rodman and Ron Artest, the 2006 NIT MVP award was a fitting capper to a three-year college career that produced 7.4 points, 5.3 rebounds and a .553 shooting average. ==Professional career== ===NBA Draft=== The Knicks' choice of Balkman in the first round surprised many, notably ESPN's Jay Bilas, who noted that projected lottery pick Marcus Williams was still available as well as future All-Star guard Rajon Rondo. ESPN columnist Bill Simmons, among others, joked that perhaps Isiah Thomas thought he was drafting Rolando Blackman, a former Knicks player and NBA All-Star.Bill Simmons' Draft Diary X However, other analysts praised Balkman's work ethic and attitude, as he had transformed himself from a relative unknown into a first-round NBA draft pick over the course of a few months. Ehud Knoll CollegeInsider.co SUMMER RUMINATIONS (PART II) There was further controversy when Thomas claimed that the Phoenix Suns were prepared to take him; the Suns claimed that he was not even \"on [their] radar\". In the NBA's official draft guide, which was released to all reporters covering the draft, Balkman was not included in the list of the 300 top players eligible to be drafted in the 2006\u201307 rookie class. However, the Knicks selected Balkman with their first of two draft picks, which was 20th overall. The Knicks later selected Mardy Collins with the 29th pick. It has also been speculated that Thomas and the Knicks selected Balkman because his agent, Andre Buck, who worked with Leon Rose, who was the agent of the then soon-to-be free agent LeBron James.Style Magazine, The Most Powerful Man in Sports?

Balkman argued with the referees, but when his argument was ignored, he shoved referees and pushed coaches and teammates that tried to calm him. After physically confronting the first referee, assistant coach Biboy Ravanes tried to calm him down but Balkman shoved Ravanes out of the way. After this, he moved to the second referee and again argued and initiated contact. At this point, Ronald Tubid, a teammate of Balkman, tried to get between him and the second referee. Balkman then moved to the third official, while being shadowed by Tubid, until he shoved Tubid out of the way. This is when another teammate, Arwind Santos, tried to intervene by putting himself between the third referee and Balkman. However, Balkman continued with his aggressive behavior, slapping Santos' arm and eventually shoving him. When Santos pushed him back, Balkman pushed him once again and then grabbed Santos' neck as their teammates tried to separate them. Balkman later apologized via his Twitter account. He said he apologized to his teammates, Santos and Santos' family as well as the team's management, and added, \"Everybody does something once in a life, they're not supposed to do.
