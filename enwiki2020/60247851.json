The Baroque Revival style building from 1917 was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 2013. The bath house was shortly thereafter reopened by a group of volunteers. ==History== In 1898, the Social Democratic group in Copenhagen City Council, headed by later mayor Jens Jensen, proposed the construction of a series of municipal bath houses in the city's working- class neighbourhoods. They were seen as an important part of the drive to alleviate sanitary problems in the city. Many working-class families, living in overcrowded tenements, had no place to bathe. The first municipal bath house opened in Saxogade in 1903. It was followed by Sofiegade Public Baths in Christianshavn and a bath house in Helsing\u00f8rsgade in the Borgergade-Adelgade neighbourhood. The public bath house in Sj\u00e6llandsgade was constructed in 1916-17. The section for women was located in the ground floor while the one for men was located on the first floor. The coal-fired boiler was also located in a room in the ground floor. The building was designed by city architect Hans Wright. The building was decommissioned when private bath rooms became common later in the century. The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places on 20 December 2013. ==Architecture== Plan of the section for women Designed in the then popular Baroque Tevival style, Sj\u00e6llandsgade Public Baths are constructed in red brick with symmetrically placed windows, a hipped red tile roof and lesenes at the corners. A tall, free-standing chimney was originally located next to the building but it has been demolished. ==Today== Sj\u00e6llandsgade Public Baths was reopened as a public bath house by a group of volunteers in the mid-2010s.It is occasionally also used as a venue for exhibitions and other events. ==References== ==External links== * Official website * PDF about the building * Sj\u00e6llandsgade Public Baths on Youtube * Havbade, str\u00f8mbade og badeanstalter ca. 1850-1990 Category:Public baths in Denmark Category:Listed buildings and structures in Copenhagen Category:Baroque Revival architecture in Copenhagen Category:1917 establishments in Denmark ",
