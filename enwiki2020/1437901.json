    "text": "Elections in Switzerland gives information on election and election results in Switzerland. ==Background== Switzerland elects on national level a collective head of state, the Federal Council, and a legislature, the Federal Assembly. The Federal Assembly (Bundesversammlung/Assembl\u00e9e f\u00e9d\u00e9rale/Asamblea Federale/Assemblea Federala) has two chambers. The National Council (Nationalrat/Conseil National/Consiglio Nazionale/Cussegl Naziunal) has 200 members, elected for a four-year term by proportional representation in multi- seat constituencies, the cantons. The Council of States (St\u00e4nderat/Conseil des Etats/Consiglio degli Stati/Cussegl dals Stadis) has 46 members, elected for four years in 20 multi-seat and 6 single-seat constituencies which are equal to the 26 cantons and half-cantons. One of the members of the Federal Council assumes the honorific title of President of the Confederation for a one-year term. Elections to the National Council conclude on the penultimate Sunday of October. In most cantons, the first round of the election for the Council of States is held alongside the National Council election, while runoff stages are held 3 to 6 weeks later. The new Federal Assembly takes office at the start of the following year. Switzerland has a multi-party system with numerous parties. A world-unique characteristic of Switzerland is that all the executives, from federal to municipal level, are plural and often include members from all main parties. ==Federal elections== ===Latest elections=== see 2019 Swiss federal election ==See also== * Swiss Federal Council election * Zauberformel == Notes and references == ==External links== *Adam Carr's Election Archive *Parties and elections * NSD: European Election Database - Switzerland publishes regional level election data; allows for comparisons of election results, 1991-2007 it:Politica della Svizzera ",
