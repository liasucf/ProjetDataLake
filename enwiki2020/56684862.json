    "text": "Hong Kong Watch is a non-governmental organisation (NGO) based in the United Kingdom that was established to monitor the conditions of human rights, freedoms and rule of law in Hong Kong. It was founded by British human rights activist Benedict Rogers on 11 December 2017, two months after he was barred from entering Hong Kong. == History == In Hong Kong, the aftermath of the 2014 Hong Kong protests and Legislative Council oath-taking controversy saw the imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists and Benedict Rogers, a British human rights activist, intended to visit them privately. On 11 October 2017, Rogers was barred entry to Hong Kong. He arrived at Hong Kong International Airport on a flight from Bangkok but was escorted away by immigration officials and placed on a flight back to Thailand. He had previously been warned by a contact in the Chinese embassy in London that he might be refused entry to Hong Kong. Rogers, who lived in Hong Kong between 1997 and 2002, has criticised what Rogers says is Mainland China's increasing threat to democracy in Hong Kong and has campaigned against the imprisonment of pro-democracy activists Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson demanded an explanation from the Hong Kong authorities and the Central Chinese government. Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, later responded that the move was within China's sovereignty and said: \"Whether this person's trip to Hong Kong involved an intention to intervene in Hong Kong's internal affairs and judicial independence \u2013 he knows very well himself.\" The following day, Rogers announced he would form a non- governmental organization (NGO) to monitor the rule of law and human rights in Hong Kong. Hong Kong Watch was launched at a reception hosted in Speaker's House, House of Commons in the Parliament of the United Kingdom on 11 December 2017. It was established on grounds of the belief of the fact that under the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the United Kingdom has a moral and legal obligation to speak out. == Mission == Hong Kong Watch was set up to provide independent, comprehensive analysis and thought leadership on freedom and human rights in Hong Kong. == See also == * Politics of Hong Kong == References == ==External links== * Category:Human rights in Hong Kong Category:Human rights organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Organizations established in 2017 Category:2017 establishments in the United Kingdom ",
