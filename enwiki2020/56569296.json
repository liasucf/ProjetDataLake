    "text": "Violet Alford (18 March 1881 \u2013 16 February 1972) was an internationally recognised authority on folk dancing and its related music and folk customs. She believed that a common prehistoric root explained the similarities found across much of Europe. ==Early life== Alford was born the third daughter of Canon Josiah George Alford of Bristol Cathedral. She had the typical upbringing of a Victorian society lady; her father taught her and her sisters music, and a governess was responsible for their other early education. After completing her studies at Clifton High School Violet was sent to a finishing school for girls in Switzerland. ==Selected works== *English Folk Dances (1925) *The Traditional Dance (1935), in collaboration with Rodney Gallop *Pyrenean Festivals (1937) *The Singing of the Travels (1956) *Sword Dance and Drama (1962) *The Hobby Horse and Other Animal Masks (1978) ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== Category:1881 births Category:1972 deaths Category:People educated at Clifton High School, Bristol ",
