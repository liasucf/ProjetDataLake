The attacker and the victim had an argument before the attack. The attacker then killed her with the weapon he retrieved from the shop and also injured another woman and a man. He was subdued by the police after he was accidentally hit by a car whose driver was distracted by the surrounding commotion. The Polish embassy confirmed that the victim, was Polish and claimed she was pregnant. Police are investigating under the assumption that it was a personal quarrel between the assailant and the dead woman. ==Perpetrator== The assailant was identified as a 21-year-old asylum seeker from Syria who had migrated to Germany about one- and-a-half years before the attack. He worked at the same Turkish kebab shop where the pregnant victim worked. He was known to police and was previously arrested for causing bodily harm. He had lived in a home in the town for seven months. One of his former roommates identified his first name as Mohamed and described him as an alcoholic who was feared by his other roommates. He also said that the attacker was in a relationship with the victim and both had previously lived together in a refugee camp. ==Trial and sentencing== The perpetrator was tried and sentenced to life in prison. ==Impact== This attack, one of four violent crimes, including the Ansbach bombing, committed by people of Middle Eastern background during the week of 18 July 2016 \u2013 three of them committed by asylum seekers \u2013 created significant political pressure for changes in the German government policy of welcoming refugees. According to The Washington Times, the attacks increased public fears that Islamist terrorist attacks of the kind that took place in France in 2015 and 2016 could happen in Germany. Florian Otto, a risk consultant from Maplecroft, said the attacks are likely to inflame anti-immigration sentiment in the country, creating a challenge for the Merkel government's policies. Kenan Malik describes the attack pointing up \"the difficulty... in drawing a distinction between jihadi violence and the fury of disturbed minds.\" ==See also== * Munich knife attack (10 May 2016) * Immigration and crime in Germany ==References== Category:2016 murders in Germany Category:2010s in Baden- W\u00fcrttemberg Category:Deaths by blade weapons Category:July 2016 crimes in Europe Category:July 2016 events in Germany Category:Knife attacks Category:Murder in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Category:Reutlingen Category:Stabbing attacks in 2016 Category:Stabbing attacks in Germany Category:Violence against women in Germany ",
