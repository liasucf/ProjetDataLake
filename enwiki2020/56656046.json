    "text": "The La Mamounia literary award (French: prix de La Mamounia) was a Moroccan literary prize founded to promote Moroccan literature written in French. It was awarded from 2010 to 2015 and carried a prize money of 200,000 dirhams (about $22,000 in 2015). The award was donated by the La Mamounia hotel in Marrakesh, which also hosted the award ceremonies every year. A jury consisting of well known literary figures selected the recipient out of a varying numer of nominations every year. From 2011 on the jury was led by the French writer and critic Christine Orban as president. Other jury members included the writers Douglas Kennedy (USA), Marie Laberge (Canada), Vincent Engel (Belgium) und Alain Mabanckou (Republic of the Congo). The internationally best known recipient is French-Moroccan writer Le\u00efla Slimani, who later went on to win the Prix Goncourt in France. Due to financial issues the prize was not awarded after 2015.Marianne Payot: Prix litt\u00e9raires: Rachid O., laur\u00e9at du 4e prix de La Mamounia.
