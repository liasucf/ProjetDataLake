Haight and manufactured by Sedgley Co. of Philadelphia for the U.S. Marines and the U.S. Navy. Its official designation by the US Navy was Hand Firing Mechanism, Mk 2. ==Description== The Sedgley OSS is a single shot, break action, smoothbore .38 Special pistol which was designed by Stanley M. Haight for the Naval Intelligence Office. It was meant as a covert operations and assassination weapon in the Pacific Theater. It was mounted on the back of a cowhide glove; the gun would be usually worn along with a long-sleeved coat to hide the weapon until it was used. Due to its appearance, it was commonly nicknamed \"Glove Pistol\" or \"Glove Gun\". The trigger is a bar parallel to and extending past the barrel. After being loaded and cocked, the weapon is fired by the shooter making a fist and pressing the trigger against the target's body. Between 52 and 200 are believed to have been manufactured. Each Sedgley was issued only as one glove and not as a pair. ==See also== *Apache revolver *Protector Palm Pistol ==References== ==External links== * \"Weird Weapon with a Hollywood Connection\" The National WW2 Museum, New Orleans website: (with picture). * \"United States Patent 2,423,448\" Category:Single-shot pistols Category:World War II firearms of the United States ",
