    "text": "The M1299 is an American 155 mm turreted self-propelled howitzer currently being developed under the Extended Range Cannon Artillery program. ==History== The Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) program was designed to produce a self-propelled howitzer system with longer range and rate of fire compared to the existing M109A7. Increased range and accuracy is accomplished by having a longer L/58 gun as well as employing the XM1113 rocket-assisted artillery shell. The howitzer is expected to eventually incorporate an autoloader that could increase rate of fire to 10 rounds per minute. == Design == === Gun === The M1299 utilises a new 155 mm L/58 calibre XM907 gun that will fire the XM1113 rocket-assisted round, which will increase the reach of the gun from the 38 km of the existing M109A7 Paladin gun to over 70 km. An autoloader for the gun will provide a rate of fire of up to 10 rounds per minute. ==References== Category:155 mm artillery Category:Self-propelled howitzers of the United States Category:Tracked self-propelled howitzers Category:Self- propelled artillery of the United States ",
