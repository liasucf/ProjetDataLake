In 2012, digital archivists at the university library worked with officials at a local veterans museum to launch the Texas Military Veterans Oral History collection. == Athletics == Sam Houston State's colors are bright orange, royal/bright blue and white and their nickname is the Bearkats. Sam Houston State sports teams participate in NCAA Division I (Championship Subdivision for football) in the Southland Conference. The top-ranked Bearkat football team was defeated by North Dakota State University in the 2012 NCAA Division I Football Championship. SHSU's athletic teams have been nicknamed \"The Bearkats\" since 1923 when the University's name was changed by the Texas State Legislature from Sam Houston Normal Institute to Sam Houston State Teachers College. Prior to 1923, the varsity sports teams were nicknamed \"The Normals\". It is doubtful those who coined the \"Bearkat\" nickname had a particular animal in mind. More likely, the name came from a popular local saying of the time, \"tough as a Bearkat!\" The late Reed Lindsey, who was a student/athlete in the 1920s and later retired as University registrar, once said that \"it was a good fighting name of the time.\" Since the animal in the saying was thought more mythical than real, the spelling settled upon was \"Bearkat.\" However, there are some arguments that the Sam Houston Bearkat is modeled after either a Binturong or a Kinkajou. In the late 1940s, then SHSU president Harmon Lowman attempted to change the SHSU mascot from Bearkats to \"Ravens\" (after General Sam Houston's Cherokee nickname). Mrs. Vernon Schuder reported that the alumni were polled and she voted for the raven but that \"all those old Bearkats beat us out!\" A Sammy Bearkat mascot character, with the later addition of a Samantha, began appearing at SHSU sports events in 1959. Samantha has since been retired. ===Rivalry=== SHSU's primary rival is Stephen F. Austin State University (SFA) and tensions between the two schools can run high before major sporting events that pit one against the other. The annual football game between SHSU and SFA, named the Battle of the Piney Woods, dates back to 1923. Since 2010, the series has been played at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas. The rivalry is the second-oldest Division I Football Championship Subdivision rivalry in Texas. ===Mascot=== Sam Houston's Bearkat is represented by Sammy Bearkat, a costumed mascot, who has entertained and led crowds in cheers during sporting events since 1959. ===Club sports=== Club sports are very popular at SHSU. Some available to students include: Powerlifting, Ultimate Frisbee, lacrosse, rugby, martial arts, trap and skeet, inline hockey, basketball, volleyball, soccer, tennis, and baseball. The Sam Houston Quidditch team won in 2013 the IQA World Cup VI Division 2 championship. The Spirit Programs, cheer, dance, and mascots, of Sam Houston hold the most National titles out of all of the sports and recreational activities at Sam Houston. The coed team is the reigning champions from NCA this past April. The All Girl team made school history by winning their first National Championship in April 2014. ==Campus media== The SHSU School of Mass Communication operates KSHU, a student-run radio (90.5 FM) and television (cable channel 7) station, broadcasting news, sports, and entertainment programming for the campus and community. \"The Houstonian\" is the student-published twice-weekly campus newspaper.
