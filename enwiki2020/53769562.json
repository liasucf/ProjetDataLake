Originally named \"Long Meadow\" by Col. McClanahan, over the years the name of the house was known as \"Villa Heights\", from which the neighborhood was named, to the Compton-Bateman house, as it is known today. \"The original dwelling of Villa Heights, built by Elijah McClanahan in 1820, was a comparatively modest Federal style house, compared to its 20th century evolution. However, it was still quite a substantial house for this area during the second quarter of the nineteenth century and, compared to most of the surrounding farmsteads of the time, would have been an iconic and impressive building. Character-defining features of its original Federal design included unpainted Flemish bond, load- bearing brick construction, a molded brick water table, and a five-bay facade with symmetrical fenestration and stone window sills. Today the fa\u00e7ade also features Classical Revival detailing around the entry, notably a round-arched opening with a fanlight transom and five-light sidelights, but it is undetermined as of yet if these were part of the original design or if they were added in a later alteration.\"National Register of Historic Places Registration Form. \"Villa Heights\" .
