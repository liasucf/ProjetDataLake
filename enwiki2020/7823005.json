    "text": "Not Too Late is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Norah Jones, released on January 30, 2007, through Blue Note Records. It was produced by Lee Alexander, the songwriter and bassist featured on Jones's previous albums, Come Away with Me and Feels like Home. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making it Jones' third consecutive number one album.Cohen, Jonathan. \"Better 'Late' Than Never: Jones Debuts At No. 1\". Billboard. February 7, 2007. Retrieved February 7, 2007. ==Background and recording== Jones wrote most of the songs on the album when she was on tour during 2004 and 2005; for example, \"Until the End\" was written in the South Pacific, \"Rosie's Lullaby\" in Australia, and \"The Sun Doesn't Like You\" in Brazil.Widran, Jonathan. \"Norah Jones Talks About Co-Writing All The Songs For Her Upcoming New Album, Not Too Late\". SongwriterUniverse Magazine. Retrieved February 4, 2007. Jones wrote \"Thinking About You\" in 1999 with Ilhan Ersahin, her then-bandmate in Wax Poetic, but she thought it was too much of a pop song for her to record and rejected a version she recorded for Feels like Home.\"Norah Jones - Not Too Late / Thinking Of You\". ilikemusic.com. Retrieved January 26, 2007. Jones had an acoustic guitar with her on the tour and wrote more songs with it than she previously had: \"The guitar is simple and a lot easier to carry than a piano\", she said. After the tour concluded, Jones began recording the album with Alexander, who \"tweak[ed]\" the lyrics of the songs and \"pulled [them] into better shape\", according to Jones. Not Too Late was mostly recorded at Jones's home studio and is the first album Jones recorded without producer Arif Mardin, who died in the summer of 2006. Jones described the sessions as \"fun, relaxed and easy\" and without a deadline; executives at Blue Note Records reportedly did not know they were recording an album. Many of the sessions were \"spur of the moment\", with friends of Jones and musicians they recommended being asked to play. The album features guest appearances by organist Larry Goldings, singer-songwriter M. Ward, and Kronos Quartet cellist Jeff Ziegler. Jones said the songs on the album are \"not so cut-and-dried\" compared to her earlier material and have \"a twist to them\". In contrast to her previous albums, the piano, organ and Wurlitzer are not as prominent as the guitar: \"the piano is always loud in the mix, but I've never been into it being the main rhythm instrument unless we're playing something funky. I've always liked the guitar as the rhythmic instrument\", Jones explained. ==Critical reception== Not Too Late received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 68 out of 100, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\" based on 23 reviews.\"Critic Reviews for Not Too Late\".

Music UK review Drowned in Sound likewise gave it a score of six out of ten and said that while the album \"is a shade darker than her mega-selling, Grammy-winning template, it's highly unlikely to win all that many new converts, and fans may find this album a little bit of a slog in places.\"Drowned in Sound review Q gave it three stars out of five and said, \"With a surfeit of samey country-rock ballads, Not Too Late ultimately proves rather a long haul.\" Blender gave the album two stars out of five and said that \"the results are a mutant virus of gorgeous and bland, grainy and slick.\" The Village Voice gave it a mixed review and stated that Jones' voice \"is still 'that voice,' but gravity was never what made it fly.\"The Village Voice review ===Accolades=== By January 29, 2007, the album had become the most pre-ordered album of all time on Amazon.com, and was Jones' second album (Feels like Home) to reach Amazon's all-time top ten pre- order list.\"Norah Jones' \"Not Too Late\" Becomes Most Pre-Ordered Album of All Time on Amazon.com\".
