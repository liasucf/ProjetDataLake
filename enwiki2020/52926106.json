    "text": "The WaterLoo Pub The WaterLoo Pub, previously known as \"Puutorin Vessa\", is an English pub in the City of Turku, Finland. The circular building sits on the Puutori square, and it once served as a public restroom, hence the pun. ==History== The building was completed in 1933 and it was designed by Totti Sora to serve as the weigh house for the bus station operating at the square. The building was open as a public restroom until 1986. Markku Heikkil\u00e4 and Kaija V\u00e4is\u00e4nen renovated the building and it became a restaurant under the name \"Puutorin Vessa\". The restaurant opened on the 6th of June 1997 and it was operated by Heikkil\u00e4 till 2007 and then by Lasse Laaksonen. The restaurant declared bankruptcy in 2014, when it was taken over by Tim Glogan, who opened it as the WaterLoo Pub. At the end of 2018, Tim Glogan sold the business to Kenneth Forsstr\u00f6m, owner of the Merihelmi Pub Boat on the River Aura. He will reopen it in February 2019 under its original name, Puutorin Vessa. ==References== ==External links== *The WaterLoo Pub Category:Buildings and structures in Turku Category:Pubs in Turku Category:Tourist attractions in Turku ",
