    "text": "Slinzega Valtellinese Slinzega is a type of air-dried meat produced in Valtellina and Valchiavenna in the Italian Alps. It is made in a similar manner to Bresaola, with smaller pieces of meat, which therefore bear a stronger taste. According to some sources it originally used horse meat rather than beef. Nevertheless, today virtually any type of meat is suitable to its production, the most common being beef, deer and pork. ==See also== * List of dried foods ==References== * Salami and Sausages of Valtellina Category:Italian cuisine Category:Dried meat ",
