    "text": "The Hominini, or hominins, form a taxonomic tribe of the subfamily Homininae (\"hominines\"). Hominini includes the extant genera Homo (humans) and Pan (Chimpanzees and Bonobos), but excludes the genus Gorilla (gorillas). The term was originally introduced by John Edward Gray (1824), long before any details on the speciation of Pan and Homo were known. Gray's tribe Hominini by definition includes both Pan and Homo. This definition is still adhered to in the proposal by Mann and Weiss (1996), which divides Hominini into three subtribes, Panina (containing Pan), Hominina (\"homininans\", containing Homo \"humans\"), and Australopithecina (containing several extinct \"australopithecine\" genera). Alternatively, Hominini is taken to exclude Pan. In this case, Panini (\"panins\", Delson 1977)Delson, Journal of Human Evolution 6 (1977), p. 450. may refer to the tribe containing Pan as its only genus.Potts (2010). \u201cWhat Does It Mean to Be Human?\u201d, pp. 34. . National Geographic Society, Washington.\"Conventionally, taxonomists now refer to the great ape family (including humans) as 'hominids', while all members of the lineage leading to modern humans that arose after the split with the [Homo- Pan] LCA are referred to as 'hominins'. The older literature used the terms hominoids and hominids respectively.\" Minority dissenting nomenclatures include Gorilla in Hominini and Pan in Homo (Goodman et al. 1998), or both Pan and Gorilla in Homo (Watson et al. 2001). ==Terminology and definition== By convention, the adjectival term \"hominin\" (or nominalized \"hominins\") refers to the tribe Hominini, while the members of the subtribe Hominina (and thus all archaic human species) are referred to as \"homininan\" (\"homininans\"). This follows the proposal by Mann and Weiss (1996), which presents tribe Hominini as including both Pan and Homo, placed in separate subtribes. The genus Pan is referred to subtribe Panina, and genus Homo is included in the subtribe Hominina (see above). However, there is an alternative convention which uses \"hominin\" to exclude members of Panina, i.e. either just for Homo or for both human and australopithecine species. This alternative convention is referenced in e.g. Coyne (2009)Coyne, Jerry A. (2009) Why Evolution Is True, pp.197-208, 244, 248. (hc), (pbk). Penguin Books Ltd, London. \"Anthropologists apply the term hominin to all the species on the \"human\" side of our family tree after it split from the branch that became modern chimps.\" (p.197) and in Dunbar (2014). Potts (2010) in addition uses the name Hominini in a different sense, as excluding Pan, and uses \"hominins\" for this, while a separate tribe (rather than subtribe) for chimpanzees is introduced, under the name Panini. In this recent convention, contra Gray, the term \"hominin\" is applied to Homo, Australopithecus, Ardipithecus, and others that arose after the split from the line that led to chimpanzees (see cladogram below); that is, they distinguish fossil members on the human side of the split, as \"hominins\", from those on the chimpanzee side, as \"not hominins\" (or \"non-hominin hominids\"). ==Cladogram== This cladogram shows the clade of superfamily Hominoidea and its descendent clades, focussed on the division of Hominini (omitting detail on clades not ancestral to Hominini). The family Hominidae (\"hominids\") comprises the tribes Ponginae (including orangutans), Gorillini (including gorillas) and Hominini, the latter two forming the subfamily of Homininae. Hominini is divided into Panina (chimpanzees) and Australopithecina (australopithecines). The Hominina (humans) are usually held to have emerged within the Australopithecina (which would roughly correspond to the alternative definition of Hominini according to the alternative definition which excludes Pan). Genetic analysis combined with fossil evidence indicates that hominoids diverged from the Old World monkeys about 25 million years ago (Mya), near the Oligocene-Miocene boundary. The most recent common ancestors (MRCA) of the subfamilies Homininae and Ponginae lived about 15 million years ago.The most well-known fossil genus of Ponginae is Sivapithecus, consisting of several species from 12.5 million to 8.5 million years ago. It differs from orangutans in dentition and postcranial morphology. > In the following cladogram, the approximate time the clades radiated newer clades is indicated in millions of years ago (Mya). ==Evolutionary history== Model of the phylogeny of Hominini over the past 10 million years. Both Sahelanthropus and Orrorin existed during the estimated duration of the ancestral chimpanzee-human speciation events, within the range of eight to four million years ago (Mya). Very few fossil specimens have been found that can be considered directly ancestral to genus Pan. News of the first fossil chimpanzee, found in Kenya, was published in 2005. However, it is dated to very recent times\u2014between 545 and 284 thousand years ago. The divergence of a \"proto-human\" or \"pre-human\" lineage separate from Pan appears to have been a process of complex speciation-hybridization rather than a clean split, taking place over the period of anywhere between 13 Mya (close to the age of the tribe Hominini itself) and some 4 Mya. Different chromosomes appear to have split at different times, with broad-scale hybridization activity occurring between the two emerging lineages as late as the period 6.3 to 5.4 Mya, according to Patterson et al. (2006), This research group noted that one hypothetical late hybridization period was based in particular on the similarity of X chromosomes in the proto-humans and stem chimpanzees, suggesting that the final divergence was even as recent as 4 Mya. Wakeley (2008) rejected these hypotheses; he suggested alternative explanations, including selection pressure on the X chromosome in the ancestral populations prior to the chimpanzee\u2013human last common ancestor (CHLCA). \"Patterson et al. suggest that the apparently short divergence time between humans and chimpanzees on the X chromosome is explained by a massive interspecific hybridization event in the ancestry of these two species. However, Patterson et al. do not statistically test their own null model of simple speciation before concluding that speciation was complex, and\u2014even if the null model could be rejected\u2014they do not consider other explanations of a short divergence time on the X chromosome. These include natural selection on the X chromosome in the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees, changes in the ratio of male-to-female mutation rates over time, and less extreme versions of divergence with gene flow. I therefore believe that their claim of hybridization is unwarranted.\" Most DNA studies find that humans and Pan are 99% identical,Mary-Claire King (1973) Protein polymorphisms in chimpanzee and human evolution, Doctoral dissertation, University of California, Berkeley. but one study found only 94% commonality, with some of the difference occurring in noncoding DNA. It is most likely that the australopithecines, dating from 4.4 to 3 Mya, evolved into the earliest members of genus Homo.Coyne, Jerry A. (2009) Why Evolution Is True, pp.202-204. (hc), (pbk). Penguin Books Ltd, London. \"After A. afarensis, the fossil record shows a confusing melange of gracile australopithecine species lasting up to about two million years ago. \u2026 [T]he late australopithecines, already bipedal, were beginning to show changes in teeth, skull, and brain that presage modern humans. It is very likely that the lineage that gave rise to modern humans included at least one of these species.\" In the year 2000, the discovery of Orrorin tugenensis, dated as early as 6.2 Mya, briefly challenged critical elements of that hypothesis,Potts, Richard and Sloan, Christopher. \u201cWhat Does It Mean to Be Human?\u201d, pp. 38-39. . National Geographic Society, Washington. as it suggested that Homo did not in fact derive from australopithecine ancestors.:\"The discovery of Orrorin has ... radically modified interpretations of human origins and the environmental context in which the African apes/hominoid transition occurred, although ... the less likely hypothesis of derivation of Homo from the australopithecines still holds primacy in the minds of most palaeoanthropologists.\" All the listed fossil genera are evaluated for: # probability of being ancestral to Homo, and # whether they are more closely related to Homo than to any other living primate\u2014two traits that could identify them as hominins. Some, including Paranthropus, Ardipithecus, and Australopithecus, are broadly thought to be ancestral and closely related to Homo;Potts, Richard and Sloan, Christopher. \u201cWhat Does It Mean to Be Human?\u201d, pp. 31-42. . National Geographic Society, Washington. others, especially earlier genera, including Sahelanthropus (and perhaps Orrorin), are supported by one community of scientists but doubted by another. ==List of known hominin species== ==See also== *Human evolution *List of human evolution fossils *History of hominoid taxonomy *Human taxonomy ==References== * ==External links== *Human Timeline (Interactive) \u2013 Smithsonian, National Museum of Natural History (August 2016).
