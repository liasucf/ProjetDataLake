By the tournament's conclusion, the Rockhampton Rockets were crowned as the best male basketball club in Australia while the Townsville Flames were crowned women's champions for the second year in succession. The tournament marked the final year of National Finals in Australian state basketball after the Australian Basketball Association was disbanded following the 2008 season. ==Tournament overview== The 2008 ACC quarter-finals began on 16 August when the two SEABL men's conference champions, the Hobart Chargers (South) and the Knox Raiders (East), faced off for the overall SEABL championship and a spot in the ACC semi-finals. The remaining 14 teams (eight women's and six men's) then faced off against each other on 23 August to determine who would be heading to the Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre on 30 August for the semi-finals. The Rockhampton Rockets booked their place in the men's decider after a thrilling 100\u201393 victory over the Sandringham Sabres in the semi-final, while the Chargers defeated the Melbourne Tigers 128\u2013126 in overtime in the other semi-final. In the men's Grand Final, the Rockets defeated the Chargers in a cliff hanger, 103\u201399, with grand final MVP Ryan McDade finishing with 24 points and 19 rebounds. In the women's Grand Final, the Townsville Flames made it double celebrations for Queensland teams, clinching back-to-back national women's championships. The Flames, who edged out the Kilysth Cobras 77\u201371 in their semi, overpowered the Sydney Comets 73\u201357 in the decider. A Flames win looked on the cards at halftime when they led 38\u201326, but Sydney responded with a 22\u201310 third-quarter run to level the scores before Townsville went on a devastating 25\u20139 run spearheaded by MVP Cherie Smith to seal the Championship. The win marked the second year in a row that Queensland's champions completed a men's and women's ACC double. ==Participants== To qualify for the event, teams had to be crowned Champion of their respective Leagues.
