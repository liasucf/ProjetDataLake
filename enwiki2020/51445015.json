    "text": "The Challenger Sale is the first non-fiction book by Matthew Dixon, Brent Adamson, and their colleagues at CEB Inc. The book was published on November 10, 2011 by Portfolio/Penguin. In the text, the book argues that relationship- building is no longer the best sales method. To sell complex, large-scale business-to-business solutions, customers are changing how they buy so sales people must change how they sell. The authors\u2019 study found that sales reps fall into one of five profiles, and the challenger seller is the highest performer. ==Reception== This book has been an Amazon best-seller in the Sales and Selling category. == Translated Book == \u0411\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0410\u0434\u0430\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043d, \u041c\u0435\u0442\u044c\u044e \u0414\u0456\u043a\u0441\u043e\u043d. \u0421\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0446\u0456. \u042f\u043a \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438 / \u043f\u0435\u0440. \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u043e \u041a\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0431. \u2014 \u041a.: \u041d\u0430\u0448 \u0424\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0442, 2018. \u2014 240 \u0441. \u2014 . ==References== ==External links== * Book Publisher website * Challenger \u2014 Change your point of view to change your potential * Linkedin - Brent Adamson. linkedin.com * The Challenger Sale: Taking Control of the Customer Conversation Category:2011 non-fiction books Category:Business books ",
