Language, Discourse, and Praxis in Ancient China. https://books.google.com/books?id=MLx_BAAAQBAJ&pg;=PA14 Arguing over forms and names (xing ming zhi bian), Deng is cited by Liu Xiang as the originator of the \"Legalists\" and Logicians Xing-Ming principle judging names and realities (ming-shih), likely making him an important contributor to both Chinese philosophy and the foundations of Chinese statecraft. The Xunzi pairs him with Hui Shi as part of a general intellectual tradition, though the two lived 200 years apart. While Han Fei tended to dismiss the Logicians as useless (despite the 'Legalists' deriving a part of their statecraft from them), Xunzi's primary complaint about the two was that they didn't conform to ritual and \"righteousness\", or the \"facts about right and wrong\", portraying him as talent that, neglecting the way (Confucian morality), wastes his time on pointless intellectual games and sophistry.Fraser, Chris, \"School of Names\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/school-names/ ==Deng Xi Zi== The Han History (Hanshu) attributes two scrolls of writings to Deng Xi, neither of which survives,Fraser, Chris, \"School of Names\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/school-names/ though Professor Zhenbin Sun at least considers the text bearing Deng's name to reflect his thought. It recommends that a wise king \"follow names and observe actualities, examine laws and establish authority\", saying that \"positions cannot be surpassed, official titles cannot be used, and officials have their own responsibilities according to their names titles. The superior follows the names and inspects if they correspond to actuality, the subordinate carries the orders and puts them into practice.\"Xing Lu. 1998. p.134.

Language, Discourse, and Praxis in Ancient China. https://books.google.com/books?id=MLx_BAAAQBAJ&pg;=PA16 Along more logical lines comparable to Mozi it advocates \"distinguishing different categories so that they may not hinder each other, and to organize different bases so that they may not disturb each other.\"Zhenbin Sun 2015. p.113. Language, Discourse, and Praxis in Ancient China. https://books.google.com/books?id=MLx_BAAAQBAJ&pg;=PA113 ==Biography== Developing his debating skills in the legal courts of the state of Zheng, Deng served as a minor official there. Depicted as taking both sides of his cases, he is said to have argued for the permissibility of contradictory propositions, likely engaging in hair-splitting debates on the interpretation of laws, legal principles and definitions.Antonio S. Cua 2003 p.492.

Zalta (ed.). https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/school-names/ The Annals of Lu Buwei introduce him as a man who could \"argue a right to be wrong and a wrong to be right, (for whome) right and wrong had no fixed standard, and 'yea' and nay' changed every day.... What he wished to win always won, and whom he desired to punish was always punished.\"Zhenbin Sun 2015. p.15. Language, Discourse, and Praxis in Ancient China. https://books.google.com/books?id=MLx_BAAAQBAJ&pg;=PA15 His consultation attracted many clients seeking legal advice, and apparently charging for cases in articles of clothing (sensible for 500 BCE) he would eventually have enough to count him rich.Xing Lu. 1998. p.131. Rhetoric in Ancient China, Fifth to Third Century, B.C.E. https://books.google.com/books?id=72QURrAppzkC&pg;=PA131 Xunzi's book pairing him with Hui Shi, it is difficult to separate their contributions. An example of his sophistry: > The Wei River was extremely high. A person from the house of a rich man of > Zheng drowned. Someone found the body. The rich man asked to buy it back. > The man demanded very much money. The rich man told Deng Xi about it. Deng > Xi said, \u201cCalm down. There's certainly no one else he can sell the body to.\u201d > The man who found the body was troubled by this and told Deng Xi about it. > Deng Xi replied to him by saying, \u201cCalm down. There's certainly nowhere else > they can buy the body.\u201dBryan W. Van Norden 2011. p.102. Introduction to > Classical Chinese Philosophy. > https://books.google.com/books?id=TtK5750bm30C&pg;=PA102 Despite this portrayal, more modern scholars consider that, having taken the time to write his own penal code, Deng may have been a well-intentioned legal reformer opposing what he saw as the suppression of ideas and opinions. Nit- picking the law to defy Zichan's attempts to stop the publication of posters, Professors Xing Lu and Zhenbin Sun consider Deng to have challenged Confucian Li in favour of litigation and a free exchange, favoring what is termed \"big\" or communal arguments over petty ones as better resolving issues.Xing Lu. 1998. p.130-132.
