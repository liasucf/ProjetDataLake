    "text": "Xenophanes is a lunar impact crater that is located along the northwestern limb of the Moon. It is nearly attached to Volta, a similar formation to the south-southwest. To the northeast is the smaller crater Cleostratus. Xenophanes is significantly foreshortened when viewed from the Earth, hindering observation. It is a worn and eroded crater with a battered outer rim that is overlaid by several smaller craters. The rim is a circular range of rugged, irregular ground that is notched in places along the inner wall. A chain of small craters lies along the northern and northeastern rim. At the west end, a pair of clefts in the rim nearly join the floor to the surface beyond. To the northeast, Xenophanes A is an impact crater with a sharp rim and a rough interior. The interior surface is irregular, but sections have been resurfaced by basaltic lava. A pair of flooded crater rims lie along the southern and northeast sections of the interior. The interior is more level and less rough at the eastern end. Xenophanes captured with a telescope ==Satellite craters== By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Xenophanes. {| class=\"wikitable\" !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Xenophanes !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Latitude !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Longitude !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Diameter |- |align=\"center\"|A |align=\"center\"|60.1\u00b0 N |align=\"center\"|84.8\u00b0 W |align=\"center\"|42 km |- |align=\"center\"|B |align=\"center\"|59.4\u00b0 N |align=\"center\"|80.5\u00b0 W |align=\"center\"|15 km |- |align=\"center\"|C |align=\"center\"|59.6\u00b0 N |align=\"center\"|78.7\u00b0 W |align=\"center\"|8 km |- |align=\"center\"|D |align=\"center\"|58.6\u00b0 N |align=\"center\"|77.4\u00b0 W |align=\"center\"|12 km |- |align=\"center\"|E |align=\"center\"|58.1\u00b0 N |align=\"center\"|85.8\u00b0 W |align=\"center\"|12 km |- |align=\"center\"|F |align=\"center\"|56.7\u00b0 N |align=\"center\"|73.2\u00b0 W |align=\"center\"|24 km |- |align=\"center\"|G |align=\"center\"|56.9\u00b0 N |align=\"center\"|75.7\u00b0 W |align=\"center\"|7 km |- |align=\"center\"|K |align=\"center\"|58.7\u00b0 N |align=\"center\"|84.5\u00b0 W |align=\"center\"|13 km |- |align=\"center\"|L |align=\"center\"|54.8\u00b0 N |align=\"center\"|78.6\u00b0 W |align=\"center\"|21 km |- |align=\"center\"|M |align=\"center\"|54.8\u00b0 N |align=\"center\"|79.6\u00b0 W |align=\"center\"|9 km |} ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Impact craters on the Moon ",
