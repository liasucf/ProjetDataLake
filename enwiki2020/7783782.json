He is best known for originating the roles of Judge Turpin in Sweeney Todd and Cinderella\u2019s father in Into The Woods. His other Broadway credits include 1776, Mrs. Warren's Profession, A Doll's Life, and Merlin, and he also played Sir Danvers Carew in the 1990 world premiere of Jekyll & Hyde. ==Stage== Lyndeck, a former college professor, spent well over a dozen years in stock and regional theater roles before making his Broadway debut in the original production of 1776. After originating the role of John Witherspoon, Lyndeck went on to play Stephen Hopkins, Dr. Lyman Hall, and Charles Thomson before ending up on tour as John Dickinson. His best-known role is the evil Judge Turpin in the original production of Stephen Sondheim's Sweeney Todd, which he also repeated for the first national tour, the 1980 television broadcast, and a 1994 production at the North Shore Music Theatre.

He followed up Sweeney Todd with another Stephen Sondheim musical, Into The Woods, originating the role of Cinderella's Father. His other Broadway credits include Mrs. Warren's Profession, A Doll's Life, and Merlin. Lyndeck worked frequently in Pennsylvania regional theater. For many years he was a fixture at the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera -- most notably as Scrooge in their annual musical version of A Christmas Carol, a role he performed almost every year from 1992 to 2007. ==Film and television== Lyndeck appeared occasionally on film and television. He was a contract player on a now-defunct soap opera, The Doctors, and has had guest roles in series like Ed, The Cosby Show, and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.
