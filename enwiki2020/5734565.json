M., ed. (1952) The Penguin Book of Comic and Curious Verse.

His friend, the Rev. Bernard Walke, wrote of him: \"I regard him as not only the most original but one of the most rare personalities I have ever known ... [with] a nature too shy and at the same time too intolerant of the commonplace to meet with the world's approval.\"Walke, Bernard (2002) Twenty Years at St Hilary.
