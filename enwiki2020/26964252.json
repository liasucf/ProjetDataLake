    "text": "Kevin Borland (28 October 1926, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia \u2013 2000) was an Australian post-war Architect. His career saw works evolve from an International Modernist stance into a Regionalist aesthetic for which he became most recognized. Much of his significant works were composed of raw materials and considered \u2018Brutalist\u2019 typifying Borland\u2019s renowned motto \u2018architecture is not for the faint-hearted\u2019. Borland died in 2000 leaving a legacy of work throughout Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania.thumb ==Formative years== From 1938 to 1941 Borland attended University High School and at age 15 was offered a job as office hand at the studio of Best Overend, a pioneer of modernist architecture in Melbourne. That same year he began part-time tuition at the Melbourne Technical College studying Building Construction and Geometrical Drawing. In 1944 Borland attended first year of a Bachelor of Architecture degree at the University of Melbourne before withdrawing to join the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, serving in WWII from July 1945 to January 1947. Upon return Borland recommenced studies under the newly appointed tutors Roy Grounds and Robin Boyd. During these years Borland was an active member of the University branch of the CPA (Communist Party Australia) and the Melbourne University Labor Club. Borland\u2019s belief in an idealistic society of economic, educative and social equality was intensified by his experiences at war and remained prevalent throughout his career and life.Kevin Borland Architecture From The Heart, Doug Evans with HC Borland and Conrad Hamann. RMIT University Press Borland received the Illuminating Engineers Society Student Award for Light in Architecture in 1949 and in 1950 graduated with second class honours in Town Planning. ==Career== During 1951 and 1952 Borland worked for \u2018the Age\u2019 Royal Victorian Institute of Architects Small Homes Service under former tutors Robin Boyd and Neil Clerehan. The service aimed to supply the general public with modest affordable architect- designed homes. Through the service Borland obtained his first two major domestic commissions. The second of these (and first completed) was the Rice House (1952\u201353), which used an innovative method of chicken wire reinforced concrete shells in a lightweight form of slender vaulting roofs. The design reflects Borland\u2019s improvisation of medium, and a deep sense of Humanism, which he carried on throughout his career. Borland\u2019s first public building, in collaboration with John and Phyllis Murphy, Peter McIntyre and engineering consultant Bill Irwin - the Olympic Swimming Stadium in Melbourne (1952\u201356) - precedes many collaborative projects for large institutional buildings. The scheme\u2019s expression of primary structure reveals an idea of the interdependency of all building components. 1957 saw the beginning of the Borland & Trewenack practice which received recognition for works such as Mcarthy House, Stein House (1959), and Preshil Hall (1962). After 8 years Borland established an independent practice, and over the next decade became widely recognized, receiving numerous accolades for both residential and public commissions. ==Awards== *RAIA Victorian Architectural Medal for Outstanding Building, 1972.
