Negotiations began soon after for a potential HBO PPV fight to take place between Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Jr. and Canelo \u00c1lvarez in 2017 on the Cinco de Mayo weekend, as there was interest from both sides that a fight take place. Golden Boy president Eric Gomez confirmed a catchweight of 165 lbs was agreed between both sides. WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman was on board and said it was a \"very attractive fight.\" and would likely get his organization involved in the fight. Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Sr. spoke on December 18 about the ongoing negotiations saying Golden Boy were offering his son a small amount for the potential big ppv fight. He went on to claim his son was offered a $5m purse with no mention he would get a cut of the ppv revenue, a counter offer was submitted. A rematch clause was also discussed, which Chavez Jr. and his team had no problem with. Ch\u00e1vez Sr. went on to admit that he was fully aware \u00c1lvarez is the A-side in the fight, and would settle for no less than 30-35% of the full revenue. On December 24, \u00c1lvarez and his team gave Chavez a week to accept the terms, which included a purse of $7m, or he would consider other options. On January 12, 2017 De La Hoya and \u00c1lvarez called for the contract to be signed, which was supposedly sent to Al Haymon, who advises Chavez Jr. and urged him to sign it. A day later, Chavez Jr. claimed he had agreed all the demands set by \u00c1lvarez and was said that he would sign the contract. According to Chavez Jr. the new demands included a weight limit set at 164.5 pounds and a $6 million base purse plus PPV revenue percentages. On January 13, \u00c1lvarez officially confirmed the fight to take place on May 6, 2017. A rematch clause was also put in place if Chavez Jr. wins the fight and another clause for every pound Chavez Jr. weighs over the limit, he would be fined $1 million. == Fight == In front of a sold-out crowd of 20,510, \u00c1lvarez won the fight by a shutout unanimous decision in dominating fashion. All three judges scored it 120-108 for \u00c1lvarez. Ch\u00e1vez was very cautious throughout the fight. At times, he came forward and also had \u00c1lvarez against the ropes, but failed to throw any punches. This led to jeers from the crowd in the later rounds due to lack of action. == Post fight == \u00c1lvarez spoke to HBO's Max Kellerman in the post fight interview, speaking of his fighting style, \"Tonight, I showed I could move, I could box, I showed as a fighter I can do all things. I thought I was going to showcase myself as a fighter that could throw punches, but he just wouldn't do it. I've shown I can do lots of things in the ring, anything a fighter brings, I've shown I can showcase myself.\" CompuBox Stats showed that \u00c1lvarez landed 228 of 604 his punches thrown (38%) and Ch\u00e1vez landed 71 of 302 (24%). By the end of round 5, \u00c1lvarez landed 102 punches compared to Ch\u00e1vez's 25 landed. Early figures revealed that the fight generated at least 1 million buys. A replay was shown on regular HBO a week later and drew an average of 769,000 viewers. This was the first boxing match to generate over 1 million PPV buys that didn't include Mayweather, Pacquiao or De La Hoya since 2002, which saw Lennox Lewis retain his heavyweight world titles against Mike Tyson. Later sources confirmed the fight did close to 1.2 million buys, which means it would have generated around $80 million. ==Broadcast== The bout was aired on HBO PPV in the US, TV Azteca and Televisa in Mexico, Space in greater Latin America, SporTV in Brazil, BT Sport in the UK and Ireland and Sky Cable in the Philippines. ==Cinemas== Fathom Events broadcast the fight live in movie theaters across the US.https://www.fathomevents.com/events/canelo-vs-chavez-jr == References == Chavez Category:2017 in boxing Category:Boxing on HBO Category:Golden Boy Promotions Category:T-Mobile Arena Category:2017 in sports in Nevada Category:Boxing in Las Vegas Category:2017 in American sports Category:May 2017 sports events in the United States ",
