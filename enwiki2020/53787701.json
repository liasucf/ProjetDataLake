    "text": "Since the 1968 Summer Olympics did not feature tennis as an official sport, two unofficial tournaments were held during the Games: a Demonstration tournament and an Exhibition tournament. The Demonstration tournament was played from 14 to 20 October 1968 at three venues in Guadalajara, Mexico: Guadalajara Country Club, Atlas Sports Club and Guadalajara Sports Club; all of them featured clay courts. All matches were played at best-of-five sets; since the tiebreak rule wasn't implemented until the 1970s, a team had to win a set by a two-game margin in case of a 6\u20136 draw. Mexicans Rafael Osuna and Vicente Zaraz\u00faa won the tournament by defeating Spaniards Juan Gisbert Sr. and Manuel Santana 6\u20134, 6\u20133, 6\u20134 in the final. French Pierre Darmon and Mexican Joaqu\u00edn Loyo Mayo won the third place. ==Seeds== The top seed received a bye into the second round. ==Draw== ==References== ==External links== * Official Results Archive (ITF) 1968 Demonstration ",
