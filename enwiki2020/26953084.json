    "text": "Theobald Butler, 1st Baron Cahir or Caher (died 1596) was an Anglo-Irish peer. He was the son of Piers Butler of Cahir and the nephew of Thomas Butler, 1st Baron Cahir (of the first creation). As Theobald's first cousin Edmund, the 2nd Baron, died without issue, the title became extinct. It was, however, revived on May 6, 1583 in Theobald's favour.Butlers of Cahir.Burke, John Bernard (1852). A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire.
