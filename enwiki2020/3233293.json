    "text": "The Los Teques Metro is a suburban mass-transit system in the city of Los Teques, Venezuela with connections to important surrounding cities and communities. It was opened to public service on November 3, 2006. The Los Teques Metro currently operates one service (branded as lines 1 and 2 for the two parts of the system) connecting 5 stations, with additional stations for Line 2 under construction. The system connects the city of Los Teques with the capital city of Caracas. The Los Teques Metro is operated by Metro de Caracas \u2013 as such, it is effectively a subsidiary/extension of the Caracas Metro, and is widely viewed as part of that system. It is ascribed to the Venezuelan government and the Ministry of Infrastructure. The government of Miranda State and the mayorship of the Guaicaipuro Municipality are also financing its development. The New Line 2-3 Project New Alstom Metropolis Train Departing Ali Primera Station The currently operating line runs for , parallel to the San Pedro River, establishing a link between Las Adjuntas and Independencia Station. == History == The subway plans date back to 1982 when it was first proposed. However, it wouldn't be until October 19, 1998 when the Metro de Los Teques transit corporation was created (now defunct) in order to carry out management, administrative duties and civil works related to the project. It was supposed to alleviate the congestion of the Panamerican Highway and ease commuting between the two cities, because of their proximity. The operation was subsequently taken over by Metro de Caracas and plans were extended to include expansion to San Antonio and a 3rd line to connect to 2nd point in Caracas. Construction for the first phase began in 2001 with works including the canalization of the San Pedro River, the tunneling and building of the bridges until reaching Las Adjuntas. It is estimated that the project cost was about 800 million US dollars. The metro system began with restricted operations: *2 railways through a single tunnel; *2 or 3 trains; *Daily service between 5:20 a.m and 11:00 p.m == Operations == The second rail within the same tunnel was formally inaugurated October 22, 2007. Trial and testing period continued with additional trains and full 7 day service from 5:10 a.m. until 11:00 p.m. implemented on November 19, 2007. The ride between Las Adjuntas and Independencia is 4,00 bol\u00edvares Bs.F for a one way ride and the price includes a subway ride within the Caracas Metro network. {|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" ! !!
