    "text": "Bubblegum is a 2020 science fiction novel by Adam Levin. The novel takes place in Illinois, though in a reality where \"curios\" \u2014 flesh-based robots \u2014 are common, and the internet does not exist. ==Writing and composition== Levin spent approximately a decade writing the novel. Originally, Levin wrote a short story featuring the protagonist of Bubblegum, Belt Magnet, which he has referred to as \"terrible\". The story was not published, and Levin later combined some of its elements with an instruction manual for the in-universe curios featured in Bubblegum, producing the earliest versions of the book. ==References== Category:2020 American novels Category:2020 science fiction novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Novels set in Illinois Category:Doubleday (publisher) books ",
