Oban is located on Halfmoon Bay (sometimes used as an alternative name for the town), on Paterson Inlet. It has aircraft connections with Invercargill and a ferry service to Bluff. The settlement was named after Oban in Scotland,Scottish Place Names Around the World \u2013 Fife to Oban (from 'rampantscotland.com'. Accessed 11 October 2008.) (An t-\u00d2ban in Scottish Gaelic, meaning The Little Bay), due to the strong influence Scottish settlers had in the south of early colonial New Zealand. According to the March 2001 New Zealand census, the island's permanent resident population was 387 at that time, a decrease of 30 since 1996. Approximately 80% of these live in Oban. Newer estimates put the population at around 400, and the island has received a moderate boost of commerce and some millions in government funding since tourism increased markedly after the opening of the Rakiura National Park. ==Climate== Oban in 1977 Oban, Stewart Island 2020 The K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as a mid-latitude oceanic (Cfb) similar to the west coast of Scotland. Temperatures are mild to cool year-round, with average high temperatures ranging from in January, the warmest month, to in July, the coolest month. The strong oceanic influence here results in small temperature variations. The diurnal temperature variation is quite low, around yearlong, and seasonal temperature variation (the difference between the warmest and coldest months) is about . Precipitation averages per year, and is evenly distributed across the year (see climate chart). Year-round, Oban lies in the direct path of mid-latitude cyclones (low-pressure systems, or depressions) arriving from the Southern Ocean, generally moving from southwest to northeast, or west to east. As such, the climate is predominantly windy, cloudy and rainy; clear days, and days with calm to minimal wind are rare. ==References== Category:Stewart Island Category:Populated places in Southland, New Zealand ",
