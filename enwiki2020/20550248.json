    "text": "The Pittsburgh Champions was a men's slow pitch softball team in the North American Softball League (NASL). The league and the team existed for only one season, 1980. The NASL merged with the American Professional Slow Pitch League (APSPL) to form the United Professional Softball League (UPSL). The team ceased to exist after the leagues merged; there already was a professional softball team in Pittsburgh (the Pittsburgh Hardhats of the APSPL) so the Champions were disbanded. == External links == *Professional Slow Pitch Softball History * Professional Softball Leagues History Champions Category:Softball teams Category:Sports clubs established in 1980 Category:1980 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:1980 disestablishments in Pennsylvania Category:Sports clubs disestablished in 1980 ",
