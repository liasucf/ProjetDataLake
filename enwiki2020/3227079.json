    "text": "BBC Points West (known as News West from June 1991 until May 2000) is the BBC's regional TV news programme for the West of England, covering Bristol, the majority of Wiltshire and Gloucestershire, northern and eastern Somerset & North Dorset ==History== Regional television news in the West of England began in September 1957 with daily short bulletins. Around this time, news bulletins for the West shared a 5\u201310 minute timeslot with Welsh news bulletins as the Wenvoe transmitter on the western outskirts of Cardiff was serving viewers in both south Wales and the West of England. The West's regional bulletins were relaunched in 1962 as Points West but still shared the new 25-minute timeslot with Wales Today. The launch of a dedicated BBC Wales television station in February 1964 allowed Points West to become a full-length regional news programme broadcast only to the West of England. Between 1991 and 2000, the programme was known as BBC News West. ==Notable presenters and reporters== *David Garmston *Alex Lovell *Ian Fergusson *Fiona Lamdin ==Former presenters and reporters== *Chris Vacher *Susan Osman *Gerald Hine-Haycock (as Gerald Haycock) *Michael Buerk *Armine Sandford *Vivien Creegor *Sue Carpenter *Clive Myrie *Saima Mohsin *Richard Angwin (Weather) ==See also== *BBC News == References == ==External links== * Points West Category:1950s British television series Category:1960s British television series Category:1970s British television series Category:1980s British television series Category:1990s British television series Category:2000s British television series Category:2010s British television series Category:2020s British television series Category:1957 British television series debuts Category:English-language television shows Category:Television news in England ",
