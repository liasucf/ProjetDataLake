Local mythology has it that this place owes it to a dharmic lady Sudharma who was the wife of a local chieftain. She is an embodiment of good character and a very pious. One day the trinity come in the form of visitors and ask for bhiksha (alms). She gives them newly harvested Raghava Dhanya or Ragi. Her mother in law disapproves it and wants it back. This being an unholy act she says that if the visitors do not want the bhiksha then she does not need the Ragi. This Ragi becomes a hillock. In the end, the holy trinity are pleased with her selfless behavior and grant her their sacred darshan. The holy trinity expressed their will to remain near the hillock and turned themselves into stones nearby. These three stones now bear engravings of the trinity. The temple was formed in 1969 and registered in 1972.http://www.bengaloorutourism.com/ragigudda-anjaneya-temple.php == Culture == Over the past decades, this temple has become the social center in this locality.
