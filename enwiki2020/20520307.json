    "text": "Pumpkin, Powder, Scarlet & Green is the third album released by the 60's pop group The American Breed, released in the summer of 1968. This album was not as successful as their first two efforts, but the album did manage to have three modest hit singles: \"Cool It (We're Not Alone)\", \"Ready, Willing and Able\" (#84), and a cover version of The Troggs' \"Anyway That You Want Me\" (#88). Unfortunately, this album marked a beginning in decline of the group's popularity. ==Track listing== ==References== Category:1968 albums Category:The American Breed albums ",
