    "text": "Jeffrey Smith (born 28 June 1980) is an English former footballer who played as a midfielder. He started his career with Hartlepool United in 1998, but a year he later moved on to Barrow, and shortly after Bishop Auckland. After two years at Bishop Auckland, he was signed by Bolton Wanderers. Rarely used by Bolton, he was instead loaned out to Macclesfield Town, Scunthorpe United, Rochdale, and Preston North End, before he signed permanently with Port Vale in 2004. A regular in the first team at Vale, he left after three years to sign with Carlisle United. In 2009, he joined Darlington, but only spent one season at the club. In August 2010 he moved to Belgium to play one season with Olympic Charleroi, before he returned to England with Whitby Town a year later. In July 2012, he joined Celtic Nation. ==Playing career== ===Early career=== Smith started his footballing career at Hartlepool United in 1998, but was released a year later in 1999 following a long-term injury. After his release, Smith joined non-League team Barrow, but played only one game before moving on to Bishop Auckland. ===Bolton Wanderers=== Smith's performances at Bishop Auckland were much improved and he was hailed as one of the best crossers in non-league football. In March 2001, Smith joined Football League First Division club Bolton Wanderers on a short contract deal after impressing during a week-long trial. Smith wanted to show Wanderers manager Sam Allardyce that he could make the grade in the Football League. Smith played in the final league match of the 2000\u201301 season, a 1\u20131 draw against Sheffield United. He signed a new contract following Bolton's promotion to the Premier League, but struggled to get into the first team, playing a few League Cup matches. Smith was loaned to Macclesfield Town for two months to gain some experience in December 2001, and scored two goals in eight league games. He still struggled to get into the first team, playing in one Premier League match away to West Ham United, again the last game of the season. In the two following seasons Smith played only a handful of League Cup and FA Cup matches and was loaned out to Scunthorpe United, Rochdale and Preston North End for brief periods at the back end of the 2003\u201304 season. During the three loan spells he made a combined total of just two starts and five substitute appearances, with injury also plaguing him. He was released by Wanderers in the summer. ===Port Vale=== In June 2004, Smith joined Port Vale on a one-year contract. He was a first team regular during his first season at the club and Vale offered Smith a new contract, which he accepted. Smith was again in and around the first team throughout the 2005\u201306 season, and signed a new one-year deal at the end of the campaign. Smith started the first half of the 2006\u201307 season very strongly, attracting interest from other clubs. ===Carlisle United=== In January 2007, Smith joined Carlisle United for a fee of \u00a360,000 on a 2\u00bd year contract. Smith made his Carlisle d\u00e9but in a goalless draw at Brentford, scoring his first goal at Doncaster Rovers a week later. He was injured in a 2\u20131 win over Luton Town after coming on as a substitute, causing him to be replaced himself. This was his last game of the campaign. Smith was released from Carlisle at the end of 2008\u201309 after having played just twenty games all season, with the club narrowly avoiding relegation out of League One. ===Darlington=== He was signed by League Two's Darlington manager Colin Todd in June 2009. Darlington had a poor season, relegated out of the English Football League, eighteen points from safety, losing 32 of their 46 games, the team managed to score just 33 goals. ===Later career=== In July 2010 he went on trial at Scottish Premier League side Aberdeen, but was not offered a contract. The following month he signed a two-year contract with Olympic Charleroi of the Belgian Third Division B. After one season of football in Belgium he returned to England, and spent July 2011 on trial at Rotherham United. In November, he joined up with Whitby Town in the Northern Premier League Premier Division. Darren Williams' \"Seasiders\" finished the 2011\u201312 season in 17th place, six points above the relegation zone. In July 2012, he signed with Celtic Nation of the Northern League Division One. ==Statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !rowspan=\"2\"|Division !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |Hartlepool United||1998\u201399||Third Division||3||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||4||0 |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Bolton Wanderers||2000\u201301||First Division||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- |2001\u201302||Premier League||1||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||2||0 |- |2002\u201303||Premier League||0||0||2||0||1||0||0||0||3||0 |- |2003\u201304||Premier League||0||0||2||0||0||0||0||0||2||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !2!!0!!4!!0!!2!!0!!0!!0!!8!!0 |- |Macclesfield Town (loan)||2001\u201302||Third Division||8||2||0||0||0||0||0||0||8||2 |- |Scunthorpe United (loan)||2003\u201304||Third Division||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- |Rochdale (loan)||2003\u201304||Third Division||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- |Preston North End (loan)||2003\u201304||First Division||5||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||5||0 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Port Vale||2004\u201305||League One||34||1||2||0||1||0||2||0||39||1 |- |2005\u201306||League One||27||1||2||0||0||0||1||1||30||2 |- |2006\u201307||League One||27||3||2||0||4||1||1||0||34||4 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !88!!5!!6!!0!!5!!1!!4!!1!!103!!7 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Carlisle United||2006\u201307||League One||17||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||17||1 |- |2007\u201308||League One||22||1||2||0||2||0||2||0||28||1 |- |2008\u201309||League One||16||0||3||0||1||0||0||0||20||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !55!!2!!5!!0!!3!!0!!2!!0!!65!!2 |- |Darlington||2009\u201310||League Two||24||0||1||0||1||0||2||0||28||0 |- |Olympic Charleroi||2010\u201311||Third Division B||12||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||12||1 |- |Whitby Town||2011\u201312||Northern Premier||22||2||0||0||0||0||1||0||23||2 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !221!!12!!16!!0!!11!!0!!10!!2!!258!!14 |} ==Honours== ;Bishop Auckland *Durham Challenge Cup winner: 2001 ;Bolton Wanderers *Football League First Division play-off winner: 2001 ==References== Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Middlesbrough Category:English footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Hartlepool United F.C. players Category:Barrow A.F.C. players Category:Bishop Auckland F.C. players Category:Bolton Wanderers F.C. players Category:Macclesfield Town F.C. players Category:Scunthorpe United F.C. players Category:Rochdale A.F.C. players Category:Preston North End F.C. players Category:Port Vale F.C. players Category:Carlisle United F.C. players Category:Darlington F.C. players Category:English expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Belgium Category:R.O.C. de Charleroi-Marchienne players Category:Whitby Town F.C. players Category:Celtic Nation F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:English Football League players Category:Northern Premier League players ",
