    "text": "International Yoga day at a glance The International Day of Yoga has been celebrated annually on 21 June since 2015, following its inception in the United Nations General Assembly in 2014.UN Declared 21 June as International Day of Yoga Yoga is a physical, mental and spiritual practice which originated in India. The Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, in his UN address suggested the date of 21 June, as it is the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere and shares a special significance in many parts of the world. ==Origin== The idea of an International Day of Yoga was first proposed by the current Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, during his speech at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), on 27 September 2014. He stated:Modi calls for Yoga Day in UN General Assembly Following this initial proposal, the UNGA held informal consultations on the draft resolution, entitled \"International Day of Yoga\", on 14 October 2014. The consultations were convened by the delegation of India. In 2015 Reserve Bank of India issued a 10 rupees commemorative coin to mark the International Day of Yoga.10 rupees coin of 2015 \u2013 International Day of Yoga, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4oay3-JcU8&t;=2s In April 2017, UN Postal Administration (UNPA) issued 10 stamps on Asanas on a single sheet to mark International Day of Yoga.https://www.business-standard.com/article/news- ians/un-to-issue-10-stamps-of-asanas-on-international-yoga- day-117041900182_1.html ==UN Declaration== On 11 December 2014, India's Permanent Representative Asoke Mukherji introduced the draft resolution in the United Nations General Assembly. The draft text received broad support from 177 Member States who sponsored the text, which was adopted without a vote. This initiative found support from many global leaders. A total of 177 nations co-sponsored the resolution, which is the highest number of co-sponsors ever for any UNGA resolution of such nature. When proposing 21 June as the date, Modi said that the date was the longest day of the year in the mass northern hemisphere (shortest in the southern hemisphere), having special significance in many parts of the world. From the perspective of yoga, the summer solstice marks the transition to Dakshinayana. The second full moon after summer solstice is known as Guru Poornima. Shiva, the first yogi (Adi Yogi), is said to have begun imparting the knowledge of yoga to the rest of mankind on this day, and became the first guru (Adi Guru). Following the adoption of the UN resolution, several leaders of the spiritual movement in India voiced their support for the initiative. The founder of Isha Foundation, Sadhguru, stated, \"this could be a kind of a foundation stone to make scientific approach to the inner well-being of the human being, a worldwide thing... It's a tremendous step for the world.\" The founder of Art of Living, Ravi Shankar, lauded the efforts of Modi, saying, \"It is very difficult for any philosophy, religion or culture to survive without state patronage. Yoga has existed so far almost like an orphan. Now, official recognition by the UN would further spread the benefit of yoga to the entire world.\" == In practice == INS Jalashwa The first International Day of Yoga was observed around the world on 21 June 2015. The Ministry of AYUSH made the necessary arrangements in India. 35,985 people, including PM Modi and dignitaries from 84 nations, performed 21 asanas (yoga postures) for 35 minutes at Rajpath in New Delhi, becoming the largest yoga class ever held, and with the largest number\u201484\u2014of participating nations. Similar days have been held in cities in India and around the world each year since then. ==Reception== An Associated Press report in 2015 noted that the first \"International Yoga Day\" involved \"millions of yoga enthusiasts\" who \"stretched and twisted\", as well as Modi and members of his cabinet. It stated that the main road in Delhi had become an exercise area for the occasion, and reported that while Modi was speaking of \"peace and harmony\", some people in India thought the promotion of yoga was a partisan Hindu operation. It reported that a sequence of Surya Namaskar (sun salutations) was dropped because Muslims objected to the implication that the sun was the Hindu god of the sun, Surya; the chanting of the Hindu sacred syllable \"Om\" was also dropped. Others considered that the money spent on the event might have been better spent on cleaning Delhi's streets. The Christian Science Monitor wrote in 2016 that the 2014 United Nations resolution had been \"wildly popular\" but noted that yoga had a \"meditative component\" and had become known as not only a form of physical exercise but also a mental and spiritual practice. It gave as evidence the 2015 sermon by Pope Francis cautioning Roman Catholics about the idea that yoga could be a path to God; it noted, too, that Modi had replied to the charge that the Day was intended to promote Hinduism with the words \"Yoga is not about the other life. Therefore, it is not a religious practice\". The Week stated in 2015 that the government of India's purpose in holding International Days of Yoga was to have yoga recognised around the world as \"India's cultural property\", citing India's minister of yoga, Shripad Yesso Naik as stating \"We're trying to establish to the world that it's ours.\" The Week wrote that this was not likely to succeed, not least because many types of yoga were already being practised in the Western world. The article noted that Christian evangelicals agreed with the Indian government that yoga was \"primarily a Hindu spiritual practice\", but quoted the scholar of religion Ann Gleig as saying that most Western yoga was markedly changed by being in the West, and was devoid of religious content; the \"ironically\" agreeing views of strongly religious Hindus and Christians were \"historically flawed\". == See also == * Yoga * List of International Days of Yoga * World Tai Chi and Qigong Day == References == ==External links== * Ministry of Ayush \u2013 International Day of Yoga * International Day of Yoga, on UN.org Category:United Nations days Category:Recurring events established in 2014 Category:June observances Category:Health awareness days Category:International observances Category:United Nations observances Category:Yoga events ",
