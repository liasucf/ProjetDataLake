    "text": "The Bay of Arguin (; ) is a bay on the Atlantic shore of Mauritania. ==Geography== It is located south of Cap Blanc, north of Cap Timiris. The bay contains three islands, including Arguin and Tidra, as well as numerous sandbanks. It is also the site of the 12,000 km\u00b2 Banc d'Arguin National Park which includes most of the bay. The park's northern boundary is at Minou; it does not include the Dakhlet Nouadhibou, or the westernmost areas. Smaller bays within the Bay of Arguin include Dakhlet Nouadhibou in the north and Baie de Tanoudert in the east. Other promontories include Minou, Cap Sainte-Anne, Argun, Alzaz, Tagarit and Tafarit. The Oued Chibka, a seasonal and occasional stream flowing only when the climate is partly wet, is in the north-central part. Inhabited places by the bay include Nouadhibou in the north, Arkeiss and Tel-Alloul to the east and Teichott , R'Gueiba and Awguei to the south. ==History== The bay is the possible location of Cerne, a Carthaginian outpost founded by Hanno the Navigator around 500 B.C. In 1035, when Abdallah ibn Yasin founded a ribat (military refuge) on the island of Tidra at the origins of the Almoravid Dynasty.http://www.terremauritanie.com/noticias-todas-las- informaciones-historia-historia-de-la-mauritania-news-_23.html The first European to visit the bay was Nuno Trist\u00e3o in 1443, whereupon the remainder of the bay would be explored. The area is also known as the place where the French frigate M\u00e9duse was famously wrecked in 1816. ==References== ==External links== *Satellite photographs of the bay by the European Space Agency Category:Bays of Mauritania Category:Dakhlet Nouadhibou Region ",
