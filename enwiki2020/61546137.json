In 1953, it changed its name again to the Armed Forces Tr\u00f8ndelag District Music Band. On 1 January 2006, the Armed Forces Tr\u00f8ndelag District Music Band was transferred to the RNoAF under its command structure and was named the Norwegian Air Force Band.http://www.lawo.no/artists/lawo_luftforsvarets_musikkorps_eng.htm In 2010, the band began using the building at 19 Kongens Gate in Oslo as their base of operations.
