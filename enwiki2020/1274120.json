    "text": "Tjurk\u00f6 bracteate showing the word walhakurne (\"Roman grain\", i.e. gold coin) *Walhaz is a reconstructed Proto-Germanic word meaning \"Roman\", \"Romance- speaker\", or \"Celtic-speaker\". The term was used by the ancient Germanic peoples to describe inhabitants of the former Western Roman Empire, who were largely romanised and spoke Latin or Celtic languages (cf. Valland in Old Norse). The adjectival form is attested in Old Norse ', meaning \"French\"; Old High German ', meaning \"Romance\"; New High German ', used in Switzerland and South Tyrol for Romance speakers; Dutch ' \"Walloon\"; Old English ', ', ', meaning \"Romano-British\". The forms of these words imply that they are descended from a Proto-Germanic form *walhiska-. It is attested in the Roman Iron Age from an inscription on one of the Tjurk\u00f6 bracteates, where walhakurne \"Roman/Gallic grain\" is apparently a kenning for \"gold\" (referring to the bracteate itself). ==From *Walhaz to welsch== *Walhaz is almost certainly derived from the name of the tribe which was known to the Romans as Volcae (in the writings of Julius Caesar) and to the Greeks as \u039f\u1f50\u03cc\u03bb\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 / Ou\u00f3lkai (Strabo and Ptolemy).Ringe, Don. \"Inheritance versus lexical borrowing: a case with decisive sound-change evidence.\" Language Log, January 2009. This tribe occupied territory neighbouring that of the Germanic people and seem to have been referred to by the proto-Germanic name *Walhaz (plural *Walh\u014dz, adjectival form *walhiska-). It is assumed that this term specifically referred to the Celtic Volcae, because application of Grimm's law to that word produces the form *Walh-. Subsequently, this term *Walh\u014dz was applied rather indiscriminately to the southern neighbours of the Germanic people, as evidenced in geographic names such as Walchgau and Walchensee in Bavaria. These southern neighbours, however, were then already completely Romanised. Thus, Germanic speakers generalised this name first to all Celts, and later to all Romans and Romanised peoples. Old High German Walh became Walch in Middle High German, and the adjective OHG walhisk became MHG welsch, e.g. in the 1240 Alexander romance by Rudolf von Ems \u2013 resulting in Welsche in Early New High German and modern Swiss German as the exonym for all Romance speakers. For instance, the historical German name for Trentino, the part of Tyrol with a Romance speaking majority, is Welschtirol, and the historical German name for Verona is Welschbern. Today, welsch is not in usage in German except in Switzerland. This term is used there not only in a historical context, but also as a somewhat pejorative word to describe Swiss speakers of Italian and French. ==From *Walhaz to Vlach== In Central and Eastern Europe, the word for Romance peoples was borrowed from the Goths (as *walhs) into Proto-Slavic some time before the 7th century. The first source using the word was the writings of Byzantine historian George Kedrenos in the mid-11th century. From the Slavs the term passed to other peoples, such as the Hungarians (ol\u00e1h, referring to Vlachs, more specifically Romanians, olasz, referring to Italians), Turks (\"Ulahlar\") and Byzantines (\"\u0392\u03bb\u03ac\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9\", \"Vl\u00e1hi\") and was used for all Latin people of the Balkans. Over time, the term Vlach (and its different forms) also acquired different meanings. Ottoman Turks in the Balkans commonly used the term to denote native Balkan Christians (possibly due to the cultural link between Christianity and Roman culture), and in parts of the Balkans the term came to denote \"shepherd\" \u2013 from the occupation of many of the Vlachs throughout Central and Eastern Europe. The Polish words W\u0142och (pl. W\u0142osi), \"Italian\", and W\u0142ochy, \"Italy\", and the Slovenian lah, a mildly derogatory word for \"Italian\", can also be mentioned. ==Toponyms and exonyms== In the Frankish Table of Nations (c. 520, emended c. 700), there are a people called the Walagothi or Ualagothi. The term combines the prefix wala- (foreign) and the name of the Goths. The implication is that these were Romance-speaking Goths, probably the Visigoths in Spain.. Numerous names of non-Germanic, and in particular Romance-speaking, European and near-Asian regions derive from the word Walh, in particular the exonyms *Wallachia and Vlachs \u2013 \"Romanians\" Consider the following terms historically present in several Central and Eastern European, and other neighbouring languages: *in Polish: W\u0142ochy , the name of Italy, and Wo\u0142och, referring to Vlachs and historically Romanians. *in Hungarian: \"ol\u00e1h\", referring to Romanians, Ol\u00e1horsz\u00e1g to Wallachia; \"vlachok\" referring to Romanians/Vlachs, generally; \"olasz\", referring to Italians. *in Serbo-Croatian and Bulgarian: Vlah (\u0432\u043b\u0430\u0445) \u2013 to Romanians or other Romanian/Vlach subgroup. Also in Vla\u0161i\u0107, the mountain in Bosnia and Herzegovina named after the Vlach shepherds that inhabited it. *in Ukrainian: Voloh (\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0445) \u2013 to Romanians. *in Russian: Valah/Valakh (\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0445) \u2013 to Romanians. *in Greek: Vlahi/Vlakhi (\u0392\u03bb\u03ac\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9) \u2013 to Romanians or other Romanian/Vlach subgroup (e.g. Aromanians, Megleno-Romanians, etc.) *in German: Wlachen or Walachen \u2013 to Romanians of other Romanian/Vlach subgroups; Wallach \u2013 a Romanian horse, i.e. a horse that has been gelded, as the Romanians gelded their war horses for practical reasons; Walachei \u2013 to any land inhabited by Vlachs, as well as \"remote and rough lands\", \"boondocks\"; *in Czech and Slovak: Vlach \u2013 Old Czech for an Italian,http://nase- rec.ujc.cas.cz/archiv.php?art=3323 Valach \u2013 to Romanians or to their Slavic- speaking descendants inhabiting Moravian Wallachia; a gelded horse. *in Turkish: Eflak \u2013 to Wallachia and \"Ulahlar\" to Romanians or other Romanian/Vlach subgroup. *In Slovene: La\u0161ki, archaic name referring to Italians; it is also the name of several settlements in Slovenia, like La\u0161ko near Celje, or La\u0161ki Rovt near Bohinj. La\u0161ko is also the old Slovene name for the area around Monfalcone and Ronchi in Italy, on the border with Slovenia. These names are linked to the presence of larger nuclei of Romance-speaking populations at the time where the Slavs settled the area in the 6th century.

E.g. the wine variety \"Welschriesling\", common in Styria, Slovenia, Croatia and Hungary (actually not related to the white Riesling variety). It is often used as a rather sweeping, pejorative word for the nearest people of Latin/Romanic origin (the remaining neighbours of Austria being \"Tschuschen\" \u2013 Slavs \u2013 and \"Piefke\" (Germans). **Kauderwelsch (Danish: kauderv\u00e6lsk, Norwegian: kaudervelsk, Dutch: koeterwaals) is a German word for gibberish and derives from the Rhaetoroman dialect of Chur in Switzerland. **Welche, the French spelling of Welsch, refers to an historical Romance dialect in Alsace bordering German-speaking Alsace **Rotwelsch is the language of traveller communities in Germany. *In Dutch: **The Belgian region of Wallonia, cf.
