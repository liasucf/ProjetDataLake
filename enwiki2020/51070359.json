    "text": "Chaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon Valley is an autobiography written by Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez. The book compares Silicon Valley to the \"chaos monkeys\" of society. It details his career experiences with launching a tech startup, selling it to Twitter, and working at Facebook from its pre-IPO stage. == Summary == Chaos Monkeys recounts Antonio Garcia Martinez's career path. It starts as Martinez explains his quant work at Goldman, to an existing startup, to his own startup, and ultimately to larger Silicon Valley companies. He writes about real situations and discloses the inside stories he believes fill every industry. Garcia attempts to explain how advertising technology, startups, and venture capital work. == Reception == Bloomberg Businessweek reported, \"Unlike most founding narratives that flow out of the Valley, Chaos Monkeys dives into the unburnished, day-to-day realities: the frantic pivots, the enthusiastic ass-kissing, the excruciating internal politics.... [Garcia] can be rude, but he's shrewd, too.\" In CNN's review, the headline says the book \"compares Facebook's culture to fascism but fails to prove it\". TechCrunch wrote, \"If you're in a startup or even plan to sue one, Chaos Monkeys is the book to read.\" == Translated Book == \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0456\u043e \u0413\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0456\u044f \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0456\u043d\u0435\u0441. / \u043f\u0435\u0440. \u0410\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430. \u2014 \u041a.: , 2018. \u2014 528 \u0441. \u2014 . == References == == External links == * * Author website Category:Business books Category:Autobiographies Category:2016 non-fiction books ",
