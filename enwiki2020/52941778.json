These principles, formalized in Germany by Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel, emphasized the importance of playing games as a means for children to learn about the world. In establishing her school, Wehmeyer followed Frobel's philosophy, as developed in America by educators Margarethe Schurz, a student of Frobel in her native Germany, Elizabeth Peabody, and Susan Blow.Morgan, Harry.

The school operated from 1616 Winnie until November 1885, when a fire burned through forty blocks on the east side of Galveston. Beginning at Vulcan Ironworks at the intersection of 16th Street and Strand (Avenue B), the fire moved eastward and completely destroyed the 1600 block of Winnie.McComb, David G. Galveston: A History. University of Texas Press, 1986, 101. Her house and school destroyed, Wehmeyer lived elsewhere between 1885 and 1891.

Soon after the 1885 fire, Wehmeyer commenced plans for a new building at 1616 Winnie. By 1887, construction was complete on a two-story, wood-frame house with a one-story front porch.Insurance Record for 1616 Winnie, Texas History Center, Rosenberg Library, Galveston, Texas. Twentieth-century projects altered the front porch, but the front fa\u00e7ade\u2019s five bays and the hipped roof are likely remnants of the building\u2019s original design. The symmetry and restrained use of details indicate a conservative approach when compared to the more articulated examples from the East End during this period. The style of the house has been characterized as \"conservative Italianate.\"Beasley, Ellen and Stephen Fox. Galveston Architecture Guidebook. Galveston Historical Foundation, 1996, p.90.

While the 1900 Hurricane caused enough damage to displace the then sixty-one-year-old Wehmeyer, it did not destroy her building at 1616 Winnie. She retained ownership of the house until 1902, when she sold it to Worthy Boyd, a clerk in the cotton industry.Insurance Record for 1616 Winnie. Boyd leased the building to several different tenants, often simultaneously. The Galveston City Directory lists the following residents on the property in 1919 alone: businessman William H.
