    "text": "The Barbo family (later Barbo zu / von Waxenstein ) was an Austrian noble family of Italian origin, active mostly in the territory of present-day Slovenia and in Istria. The Barbo family originated in Veneto, later moving to Inner Austria, especially Carniola (present-day Slovenia). They claimed descendence from Roman Emperor Claudius. In 1547 the family settled in Ko\u017eljak (Waxenstein, in German), in Habsburg Istria. They were elevated to the rank of barons in 1622, and to the rank of counts in 1674. The family produced one Pope, Paul II, and several high-ranking officials and politicians in the Duchy of Carniola. The last male member, count Robert Barbo von Waxenstein, died in 1977.
