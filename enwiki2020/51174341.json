Dr. Wieslaw Binienda, is a Professor and chairman of the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Akron. Dr. Binienda was the lead scientist who questioned and then investigated the 2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash. His findings were in direct contradiction to the official reports published by Russian government. Similarly the research of Professor Binienda also contradicted the official report of Polish government of then Prime Minister Donald Tusk who was criticized for handling of the investigation and who's government was openly hostile towards the methodical scientific findings of Professor Binienda. Subsequently, Polish government reversed its position and under the government of President Andrzej Duda a new investigation have been initiated and advise of Professor Binienda played the key role in the direction of the new investigation . Binienda and his wife Maria Szonert-Binienda are also involved in research and education about war crimes committed by Soviet Army against Polish soldiers in Katyn massacre.http://www.librainstitute.org/PDFs/Report%20on%20Capitol%20Hill%20Katyn%20Conference.pdf Professor Binienda research includes impact simulation, fracture and damage of advanced composite materials, explicit and implicit finite element mechanics, smart materials, structural design and optimization, characterization and constitutive equation development for ceramic matrix, metal matrix and polymer matrix composites. He received the 2002 College of Engineering Outstanding Researcher Award in recognition of his research accomplishments. He has authored or co-authored 2 books, 46 journal papers and 73 conference publications and 70 presentations. == Biography == Binienda received his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Drexel University in 1987, his M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Drexel University in 1985, and his M.S. in Motor Vehicles and Heavy Duty Machines from Warsaw Technical University in 1980. Binienda is also involved in research projects with NASA. == Academic work == *Professor and Chair Civil Engineering Department University of Akron *Expert of the Steering Committee of US President Council of Advisrs of Science under Advanced Manufacturing Initiative AMP *Member of Supercomputing Committee, Ohio Supercomputer Center *Member of Resource Committee, Ohio Supercomputer Center *Member of Software Committee, Ohio Supercomputer Center == Current research == *Analysis of the Polish Governmental Plane Crash in Smolensk, Russia, on 10 April 2010 *Status Report on Smolensk Crash *High Velocity Impact on Composite Structures (Laminates, Braided Fabrics and Composites) *Characterization of Aging Influence on Braided Composites *Fracture mechanics and damage growth in composite materials *Stress and deformation analysis in FRP, MMC, BMC and rubber composite materials *Filament winding process development and analysis *Explicit FEA of Composite Structures \u2013 Impact Perforation Analysis *Nano-coating processing and analysis *Application of Advanced Composites for Retrofitting of Concrete Structures *Functionally Graded Layers Analysis *Research Facilities and Research Group *High Velocity Impact Lab (Gas Gun; Aramis System; Shearography Vacuum Chamber for NDE, Aging Chamber, MTS, etc.) *Computing software (ABAQUS, ANSYS, LS-DYNA, PATRAN etc.) == Publications == NASA Publications *W.K.
