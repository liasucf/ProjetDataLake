    "text": "\"Country House\" is a song by English alternative rock band Blur. It was released as the lead single from the band's fourth album The Great Escape on 14 August 1995. Released on the same day as the Oasis single \"Roll with It\" \u2013 in a chart battle dubbed the \"Battle of Britpop\" \u2013 \"Country House\" reached number one in the UK Singles Chart (the first of two Blur singles to reach number one, the second being 1997's \"Beetlebum\"). The song is the band's best- selling single, with over 540,000 copies sold as of May 2014. ==Background and writing== In an interview for the South Bank Show, Damon Albarn explained that it was inspired by former Blur manager Dave Balfe, who left Blur's label Food Records and bought a house in the country. ==Content== The song is about a man who retires to an expensive country house to escape the pressures of the city. The cover art features a horizontally-flipped image of Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria. ==Release and \"battle\" with Oasis== \"Country House\" received a great deal of media attention when Blur's label Food Records moved the original release date to the same day as Oasis's \"Roll with It\". The British media had already reported an intense rivalry between the two bands and this clash of releases was seen as a battle for the number one spot, dubbed the \"Battle of Britpop\". In the end, \"Country House\" won the \"battle\", attaining the No. 1 spot while \"Roll with It\" came in at No. 2. ==Music video== The music video for \"Country House\" was directed by artist Damien Hirst, who had attended Goldsmiths, University of London, with members of Blur. It features the band and a businessman (played by Keith Allen) in a flat with the band playing a board game called \"Escape from the Rat Race\" before they become trapped in the game where they are with farm animals and other people before appearing in the flat again. The band appears in the video alongside British comic actors Matt Lucas and Sara Stockbridge and model Jo Guest. It features pastiches of\u2014or tributes to\u2014Benny Hill (Lucas' doctor chasing scantily clad young women culminating in the entry of the milk van of Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West)) and Queen's 1975 video for \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". It was nominated for Best Video in the 1996 BRIT Awards. ==Promotion and release== On 20 August 1995 the charts were officially announced. (The Chart Show announced the winner the day before, though the show's chart was unofficial) \"Country House\" topped the UK Singles Chart, selling 270,000 copies, compared to 220,000 sold by \"Roll with It\", which came in at number two. Albarn himself was surprised that \"Country House\" topped the charts. He told NME, \"I sort of believed all the papers, including NME, who told me Oasis were going to win.\"\"Cockney revels\".
