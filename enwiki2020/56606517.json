Her Fantasy String Quartet, depicting the four seasons, was commissioned by the University of Glasgow and performed at the 1972 McEwen Memorial concert. ...\"Scottish Music and Drama 1946 -- Page 78 \"The 1951-52 season is the natural development from the experimental season of last year when the Saltire Music Group was first created. This consisted, and still consists of a group of musicians, amateur and professional, but with one bond between them, that of making music together. Their cradle is the headquarters of the Saltire Society, Gladstone; Land, that lovely old house in the Lawnmarket, Edinburgh, where the first four concerts were held last winter.
