Poland has an embassy in Baghdad. ==History== ===1940s=== In 1942, during the evacuation of Polish civilians from the USSR in World War II, some Polish military personnel under General W\u0142adys\u0142aw Anders, were evacuated to Iraq, while some Polish civilians went to refugee camps in Iran.The Polish Deportees of World War II: Recollections of Removal to the Soviet Union and Dispersal Throughout the World (ed. Tadeusz Piotrowski: McFarland, 2004), pp. 10, 97. ===1980s=== In the 1980s, Poland stayed neutral in the Iran\u2013Iraq War.The Soviet Union and the Middle East (Vol. 11), Soviet and East European Research Centre of the Hebrew University (1986), p. 29. ===1990s=== In August 1990, following Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, Polish intelligence agents rescued six U.S. intelligence officers out of Iraq (via Turkey). At the time, several thousand Poles were in Iraq working on construction projects, given them a greater ability to avoid detection by Iraqi intelligence. Poland's assistance to the U.S. during the Persian Gulf War, which was revealed in 1995, led to closer U.S.-Poland relations.John Pomfret, Polish Agents Rescued 6 U.S. Spies from Iraq, Washington Post (January 17, 1995).During Gulf War, Polish Agents Saved 6 American Spies, Associated Press (January 18, 1995). ===Iraq War=== In 2003, Poland participated in the U.S.-led 2003 invasion of Iraq, sending about 200 special forces initially. During the Iraq War, Poland was responsible for the Polish zone in Iraq, between Baghdad and Basra; this was one of the four occupation zones in Iraq at the time. Within Poland, there was some disappointment over a sense \"that Poland derived too little benefit from its deployment: its efforts to end the visa requirement for the U.S. were rebuffed, and its military complained that it did not get as much financial assistance as it had expected.\" In 2006, more than 10,500 Polish troops were in Iraq. At the end of 2008, all 900 Polish troops remaining in Iraq were withdrawn, with about a dozen Polish military advisors remaining. ===Anti-ISIL coalition=== After the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant threatened Iraq in 2014, Poland provided humanitarian aid to Iraq and gave political support to Operation Inherent Resolve, but hesitated for nearly two years before joining the anti-ISIL military campaign in June 2016. Poland has been an active member of the anti- ISIL coalition since. ==See also== * Foreign relations of Iraq * Foreign relations of Poland ==References== ==External links== *Embassy of the Republic of Poland, Baghdad *Embassy of Iraq, Warsaw Category:Bilateral relations of Iraq Category:Bilateral relations of Poland ",
