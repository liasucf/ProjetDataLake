Nurutdinov states that the original, written in \"Bulgar Turkic\" (here equated with the language of the Volga Tatars), in the Arabic script, was translated into Russian in the late 1930s by his uncle I.M.-K.-Nigmatullin, who did this in order to save it from an NKVD campaign of confiscation and destruction of old Bulgarian documents written in the Arabic script. The manuscript containing the Bulgarian text was destroyed by NKVD agents. Nigmatullin himself was killed in World War II, and the translation was preserved by his mother, who eventually passed it over to her grandson, Nurutdinov, in 1976. He managed to copy parts of the translation, but the original translation and some of the copies were stolen from his father's country house in the 1980s by unknown perpetrators. Finally, Nurutdinov published the remaining text. ==Contents== The text refers to numerous persons and historical events unattested in other sources; for example, it makes references to mid 7th century Khazar rulers named Khalga and Kaban, who do not appear in the account of al-Tabari, in the Schechter Letter, in the Khazar Correspondence, or any other extant document. It also associates the Bulgarians with what Nurutdinov interprets as references to Troy, Sumer and America.\u0411\u0410\u0425\u0428\u0418 \u0418\u041c\u0410\u041d \u0414\u0416\u0410\u0413\u0424\u0410\u0420 \u0422\u0410\u0420\u0418\u0425\u042b \u0422\u041e\u041c \u0412\u0422\u041e\u0420\u041e\u0419 \u0420\u0415\u0414\u0410\u041a\u0426\u0418\u042f \u0412\u0415\u0421\u0422\u041d\u0418\u041a\u0410 \"\u0411\u041e\u041b\u0413\u0410\u0420 \u0418\u041b\u0415\" \u041e\u0420\u0415\u041d\u0411\u0423\u0420\u0413 1994. \u041e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b \u0424. \u0413.-\u0425. \u041d\u0423\u0420\u0423\u0422\u0414\u0418\u041d\u041e\u0412 \u0438 \u0420. \u0428. \u0428\u0410\u0420\u0418\u041f\u041e\u0412 Some scholars view the work as a mixture of (previously known) factual data and outright fabrications, while others view the work as authentic. ==See also== *Bulgarism ==References== == External links == *Text of the C\u00e4\u011ff\u00e4r Tar\u00edx\u0131 Category:History of Tatarstan Category:Volga Bulgaria ",
