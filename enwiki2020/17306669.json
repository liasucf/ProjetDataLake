    "text": "Cyclamen graecum, the Greek cyclamen, is a perennial plant in the flowering plant family Primulaceae that grows from a tuber. It is native to southern Greece, southern Turkey and neighboring islands and is prized for its variable leaf forms, which include some of the most striking of any cyclamen. ==Distribution== Cyclamen graecum is native to a wide variety of areas up to elevation in southern mainland Greece, the Peloponnese, Aegean Islands, Crete, the southern coast of Turkey, and northern Cyprus. ==Description== At Osaka Prefectural Flower Garden, Osaka, Japan The tuber is corky, with thick, strong, fleshy anchor roots sprouting from the center of the bottom. Leaves are heart-shaped and toothed. Flowers bloom in autumn and have 5 petals, white or pink with a darker blotch at the nose. They are often fragrant. The bases of the petals are curled outwards into auricles, like Cyclamen hederifolium. After pollination, the flower stem coils both directions, starting from the center, not from the top as in Cyclamen hederifolium. ==Subdivisions== ===Subspecies=== Cyclamen graecum has three subspecies, distinguished by flower characteristics: *Cyclamen graecum subsp. graecum \u2014 pink flowers with a darker blotch at the nose (Greece, Aegean islands, Crete) **Cyclamen graecum subsp. graecum f. album \u2014 all-white flowers (Peloponnese, Rhodopou Peninsula of Crete) *Cyclamen graecum subsp. anatolicum Ietsw. \u2014 more slender flowers with a smaller blotch and slight auricles (southern Turkey, Rhodes, northern Cyprus). Now elevated to a separate species, Cyclamen maritimum. *Cyclamen graecum subsp. mindleri Hildebr. (or candicum Ietsw.) white or pale pink flowers with more pronounced auricles (western Crete) ==References== ==External links== *Cyclamen Society *Cyclamen graecum (Monthly feature article); *photos of tuber (Bulb Log 31, 30 July 2008) \u2014 Scottish Rock Garden Club *Pacific Bulb Society *photos \u2014 Flickr search *IPNI Listing *Gallery of the World's Bulbs \u2014 International Bulb Society (photo of tuber) *Kew Plant List graecum Category:Flora of Greece Category:Flora of Turkey ",
