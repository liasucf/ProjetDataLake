Its natural habitats are dry shrubland and rocky areas.Aloe melanacantha on the SANBI Redlist ==Aloe melanacantha var. erinacea== This rare plant occurs in Namibia, just to the north of the Aloe melanacantha range, and is very closely related, being almost indistinguishable superficially. However A. erinacea is slightly smaller and it sometimes grows into dense clumps due to offsetting. Depending on the authority, it is sometimes classified as a subspecies or variety of Aloe melanacantha, and sometimes as a closely related sister-species or even as part of a species continuum.PlantZAfrica.com information page - Aloe melanacantha ==References== melanacantha Category:Flora of the Cape Provinces Category:Endemic flora of South Africa Category:Taxa named by Alwin Berger ",
