    "text": "Venus & Mars is the first studio album by Dutch pop singer songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Jett Rebel, released by the record label Sony Music Entertainment on April 19, 2014 in the Netherlands. The album is composed of his first two EPs, Venus and Mars.Venus was released on May 26, 2013 and Mars on January 15, 2014. Two new songs have been added to the album, \"#\" and bonus track \"On Top of the World\", the bonus track for The Amazing Spider-Man 2. On April 19, 2014, these EPs were combined for one album. It is not considered to be his debut album. The album was produced by Rebel with help from Dutch producer JJJ Sielcken for the first seven tracks. Venus & Mars spawned the singles \"Do You Love Me at All\", \"Louise\" and Tonight\". ==Singles== Several singles were taken from the album. EP Venus debut single Do You Love Me at All was the first single with which Jett Rebel showed something of himself, the release was on June 7, 2013. The music video was released on July 12, 2013. With the single Do You Love Me at All, Rebel was proclaimed in August 2013 and nominated by radio station NPO 3FM as 3FM Serious Talent. He won this 3FM serious talent award on April 8, 2014. \"Louise\" was the second single released with a music video on September 6, 2013. Rebel told NPO 3FM what Louise is about: \"If I'm honest, it's about someone being in love with you, and you ending up with that person out of loneliness without actually sharing the feelings\". On the release day of Louise, Jett Rebel was a guest for the first time on the popular television program De Wereld Draait Door to play his single live. More than 4 months later the 3rd single and accompanying music video \"Tonight\" (EP Mars) was launched on January 17, 2014. Tonight was proclaimed as 3FM Megahit by the NPO 3FM one week earlier on January 10, 2014. Rebel was partly inspired for Tonight by the musical West Side Story. \"Rebel wanted to create the same vibe as the big party night in this musical. The song should feel like a kind of announcement or opening of something\". Initially, it was not intended that Tonight was chosen as the 3rd single. Gerard Ekdom (Radio DJ), NPO 3FM brought this idea to Rebel, because Ekdom thought this was a strong song and so it happened. On April 11, 2014 the 4th and last single from the album Venus & Mars was released. The bonus track for The Amazing Spider-Man 2, \"On Top of the World, was released with a music video on April 10, 2014. On Top Of The World appeared on the soundtrack of the film and could also be heard during the credits of the film. Rebel said: \"I see similarities between Jelte Tuinstra and Peter Parker. He is also a maverick with an alter ego. I'm very proud of this collaboration, because in this way I can bring my music to the attention in a different way. Not via a single, EP or an album, but via a soundtrack, that's new to me.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits for Venus & Mars adapted from album liner notes. ;Track 1 through 7 * Jett Rebel \u2013 instrumentation, vocals, lyrics, production * JJJ Sielcken \u2013 production, engineering * Hans Weekhout \u2013 mastering ;Track 8 through 13 * Hetkantoor Muziekproducties \u2013 mixing * Jett Rebel \u2013 instrumentation, vocals, lyrics, engineering, production * JJJ Sielcken \u2013 mixing * Hans Weekhout \u2013 mastering ;\"On Top of the World\" * Jett Rebel \u2013 instrumentation, vocals, lyrics, production * Huub Reijnders \u2013 mixing * Sony Music USA \u2013 mastering * Wisseloord Studios \u2013 mixing * Rick van Wort \u2013 drums ;Artistic personnel * Jurriaan Hoefsmit \u2013 photography * Fanny Morri\u00ebn \u2013 design * Steven G.
