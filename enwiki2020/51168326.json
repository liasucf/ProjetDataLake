The two qualified for the free dance at the 2016 and 2017 World Junior Championships. == Personal life == Nicole Kuzmich was born on October 8, 1997, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. As of January 2017, she has adopted Kuzmichov\u00e1 as her surname in competition, using the Czech feminine form. == Career == === Early career === Kuzmich began learning to skate in 2000. She competed with Jay Tam on the pre-novice level in the 2010\u201311 season. Kuzmich teamed up with Jordan Hockley in June 2011. They appeared for Slovenia at the 2013 World Junior Championships in Milan but were eliminated after placing 27th in the short dance. === Partnership with Sinicyn === In the spring of 2014, Kuzmich and Alexandr Sinicyn decided to form a partnership for the Czech Republic. Their international debut came in October 2014 on the Junior Grand Prix (JGP) series; they finished 9th at both of their JGP assignments, in Dresden, Germany, and Zagreb, Croatia. At the 2015 World Junior Championships in Tallinn, Estonia, their short dance placement, 22nd, was not enough to qualify for the final segment. They were coached by Carol Lane, Juris Razgulajevs, Jon Lane, and Natalia Karamysheva in Toronto and Oberstdorf. Kuzmichov\u00e1/Sinicyn placed 7th at both of their 2015\u201316 JGP events, in Bratislava, Slovakia, and Linz, Austria. In March 2016, they competed in Debrecen, Hungary, at their second World Junior Championships. The two placed 14th in the first segment and qualified for the free dance, where they placed 10th, lifting them to 11th overall. Competing in the 2016\u201317 JGP series, Kuzmichov\u00e1/Sinicyn placed fourth in Saint-Gervais-les-Bains, France, and won the silver medal in Ostrava, Czech Republic. == Programs == === With Sinicyn === {|class=wikitable style=text- align:center !
