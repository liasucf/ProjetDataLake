    "text": "The Tilat\u00e1 Formation (, N1t, Tpt) is a geological formation of the Bogot\u00e1 savanna, Altiplano Cundiboyacense, Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes. The formation consists of coarse to very coarse conglomerates and sandstones. The Tilat\u00e1 Formation dates to the Neogene period; Early to Late Pliocene epoch (Montehermosan to Uquian in the SALMA classification, from approximately 5.3 to 2.7 Ma), and has a maximum thickness of . The formation underlies the Quaternary sequence of alluvial, lacustrine and fluvial sediments of Lake Humboldt. == Etymology == The formation was first defined and named by Scheibe in 1933 after the Hacienda Tilat\u00e1 in Chocont\u00e1, near the Sisga Reservoir. Hubach (1957) elevated the Pisos de Tilat\u00e1 to a formation.Montoya & Reyes, 2005, p.68 == Description == === Lithologies === The Tilat\u00e1 Formation consists of medium to coarse grained sandstones and conglomerates with minor shale beds. === Stratigraphy and depositional environment === The Tilat\u00e1 Formation is the lowermost of the lacustrine and alluvial sequence of the Bogot\u00e1 savanna. It unconformably overlies the Cretaceous Guadalupe Group and the Paleogene Guaduas, Cacho, Bogot\u00e1, and Regadera Formations, and is overlain by the Quaternary Subachoque Formation of Lake Humboldt. Helmens and Van der Hammen (1995) subdivided the formation into three members; Tequendama, Tibagota (Lower Tilat\u00e1) and Guasca (Upper Tilat\u00e1). The age has been estimated to be Late Miocene to Late Pliocene based on fission track analysis and palynology, with reported ages between 5.3 and 2.7 Ma.Montoya & Reyes, 2005, p.69 The depositional environment has been interpreted as alluvial plains and alluvial fans, formed during the main phase of tectonic uplift of the Eastern Ranges in the Late Pliocene.Montoya & Reyes, 2005, p.67 Dutch geologist Salomon Kroonenberg, who studied the Neogene uplift of the Eastern Andes in Colombia, defines the main stage of uplift between six and four million years ago. Other Dutch geologists Helmens, Van der Hammen and Hooghiemstra have pushed back this uplift phase to between 4.5 and 3 Ma.Molnar, 2004, p.75 The upper part of the Tilat\u00e1 Formation is time-equivalent with the Chorrera Formation, outcropping in Subachoque and the main phase of explosive activity of the Paipa\u2013Iza volcanic complex, active between 4.7 and 3.6 Ma.Monsalve et al., 2011, p.120 == Outcrops == The Tilat\u00e1 Formation is found at its type locality in the synclinal of the Sisga Reservoir in Chocont\u00e1, in the Bogot\u00e1 River valley,Guerrero Usc\u00e1tegui, 1992, p.6 and along the road from Bogot\u00e1 to Tunja. == See also == : Geology of the Eastern Hills : Geology of the Ocet\u00e1 P\u00e1ramo : Geology of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense == References == === Bibliography === * * * * ==== Maps ==== * * * * * * == External links == * Category:Geologic formations of Colombia Category:Neogene Colombia Category:Miocene Series of South America Category:Pliocene Series of South America Category:Uquian Category:Chapadmalalan Category:Montehermosan Category:Sandstone formations Category:Conglomerate formations Category:Alluvial deposits Formations Category:Geography of Cundinamarca Department Category:Geography of Bogot\u00e1 Category:Muysccubun ",
