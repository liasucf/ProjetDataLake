    "text": "Janko Halkozovi\u0107 was a Serbian painter from Old Serbia, modern-day North Macedonia. His art, like Hristofor \u017defarovi\u0107's, developed in the tradition of Serbian southern regions. He became a renowned artist when he moved to Vojvodina in the northern part of Serbian regions. In 1757 he painted the iconostasis for Mala Remeta Monastery, and the next year he did parts of the iconostasis in Beo\u010din Monastery, where he painted several murals in 1777. Halkozovi\u0107 also painted the iconostasis in Osijek and the main icons on the iconostasis of the Church of Holy Mother's Ascension in Novi Sad, among which the dominating one is the central component of the Coronation of the Mother of God that has been attributed to him. He also collaborated with other painters, including Jovan Isailovi\u0107 Senior. Halkozovi\u0107 lived and worked at about the same time as painters Stanoje Popovi\u0107, Vasa Ostoji\u0107, Aleksije Lazovi\u0107, Arsenije Teodorovi\u0107, Joakim Markovi\u0107, Jovan \u010cetirevi\u0107 Grabovan, Teodor Ili\u0107 \u010ce\u0161ljar, Pavel \u0106urkovi\u0107, Jovan Isailovi\u0107, Pavle Simi\u0107 Ilija Lon\u010darevi\u0107, and others. Unfortunately, a great deal of their iconostases and individual paintings were destroyed or disappeared during the invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the Genocide of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia during World War II. The remaining icons and individual paintings that were recovered are now in museums throughout Serbia. Although there are elements of the old manner of painting in Halkovi\u0107's work, the dominating influences are highlighted by the trends of the baroque era. ==See also== * List of painters from Serbia == References == Category:18th-century Serbian painters Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing ",
