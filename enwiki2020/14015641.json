It was called Emmanuel Christian Fellowship (ECF) then. In 1987, Pastor Edmund Chan took over the mantle of ECF when he graduated from Singapore Bible College. In October 1992, ECF was renamed Covenant Evangelical Free Church. ==Derivation of church name== * Covenant: The Covenant points to God's unfailing promise of salvation and blessing for mankind, fulfilled in Christ. As a church, CEFC desires to uphold God's promise to this generation. * Evangelical: This reflects CEFC\u2019s commitment to the gospel and to the preaching of the same for salvation. An evangelical agrees to the virgin birth, the resurrection of Christ and justification by faith, and is devoted to the inspired Word of God. * Free: Each congregation of the Evangelical Free Church denomination has a right, under God, to govern its own affairs. * Church: CEFC is a community of believers united in Christ by His Spirit. ==Aim== To build an Intentional DiscipleMaking Church (IDMC) model so as to launch an IDMC movement to catalyse a multiplication of Intentional Disciplemaking Churches to fulfill the Great Commission Mandate. ==IDMC conferences== CEFC hosts the annual IDMC Conference which ministers to pastors and lay leaders from churches in Singapore and overseas. Its first IDMC conference was held in September 2001 with the theme \"Developing a Disciplemaking Church\". ==New Life community services== New Life Community Services (NLCS) is the face and hands of CEFC to love the community for Christ.
