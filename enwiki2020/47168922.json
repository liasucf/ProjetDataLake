Like the preceding Skylake, Kaby Lake is produced using a 14 nanometer manufacturing process technology. Breaking with Intel's previous \"tick\u2013tock\" manufacturing and design model, Kaby Lake represents the optimized step of the newer process\u2013architecture\u2013optimization model. Kaby Lake began shipping to manufacturers and OEMs in the second quarter of 2016, and mobile chips have started shipping while Kaby Lake (desktop) chips were officially launched in January 2017. In August 2017, Intel announced Kaby Lake Refresh (Kaby Lake R) marketed as the 8th generation mobile CPUs, breaking the long cycle where architectures matched the corresponding generations of CPUs. Skylake was anticipated to be succeeded by the 10 nanometer Cannon Lake, but it was announced in July 2015 that Cannon Lake had been delayed until the second half of 2017. In the meantime, Intel released a fourth 14 nm generation on October 5, 2017, named Coffee Lake. Kaby Lake is the first Intel platform to lack official driver support for versions of Windows older than Windows 10. Furthermore, Windows Update is disabled under Windows 8.1 and earlier, although an enthusiast-created modification was released that disabled the check and allowed it to continue to work on the platform. == Development history == As with previous Intel processors (such as the 8088, Banias, Dothan, Conroe, Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, and Skylake), Kaby Lake's development was led by Intel's Israeli team, based in Haifa. Intel Israel Development Centers manager Ran Senderovitz said: \"When we started out on the project, we were only thinking about basic improvements from the previous generation. But we began looking at things differently with a lot of innovation and determination and we achieved major improvements.\" He added that the performance of the seventh generation chips was improved by 12% for applications and 19% for Internet use compared with the sixth generation chips. Third-party benchmarks do not confirm these percentages as far as gaming is concerned. == Features == Built on an improved 14 nm process (14FF+), Kaby Lake features faster CPU clock speeds, clock speed changes, and higher Turbo frequencies. Beyond these process and clock speed changes, little of the CPU architecture has changed from Skylake, resulting in identical IPC (Instructions Per Clock). Kaby Lake features a new graphics architecture to improve performance in 3D graphics and 4K video playback. It adds native HDCP 2.2 support, along with fixed function decode of H.264, HEVC Main and Main10/10-bit, and VP9 10-bit and 8-bit video. Hardware encode is supported for H.264, HEVC Main10/10-bit, and VP9 8-bit video. VP9 10-bit encode is not supported in hardware. Both OpenGL 4.6 and OpenCL 2.1 are now supported.https://downloadmirror.intel.com/29904/eng/ReleaseNotes_100.8783_v3.pdf Kaby Lake is the first Core architecture to support hyper-threading for the Pentium-branded desktop CPU SKU. Kaby Lake also features the first overclocking-enabled i3-branded CPU. == Architecture changes compared to Skylake == Kaby Lake features the same CPU core and performance per MHz as Skylake. Features specific to Kaby Lake include: * Increased clock speeds on some CPUs models * Faster clock speed changes (improved Intel Speed Shift technology): it takes less time for the CPU to transition from one frequency to another, e.g. from a low-power state to a high-performance state \u2013 consequently this may bring an increase in performance and responsiveness * Improved graphics core: full hardware fixed function HEVC/VP9 (including 4K@60fps/10bit) decoding; improved hardware HEVC encoding; full hardware fixed function VP9 8bit encoding; higher GPU clock speeds for select CPUs * 200 series (Union Point) chipset on socket 1151 (Kaby Lake is compatible with 100 series chipset motherboards after a BIOS update) * Up to 16 PCI Express 3.0 lanes from the CPU, 24 PCI Express 3.0 lanes from PCH * Support for Intel Optane Memory storage caching (only on motherboards with the 200 series chipsets) * Support for PTWRITE instruction to write data to an Intel Processor Trace packet stream == Compatibility == Microsoft only officially supports Kaby Lake on computers running Windows 10 per support policies, and Windows Update blocks updates from being installed on Kaby Lake systems running versions older than Windows 10. In support of this position, Intel only provides chipset drivers for Windows 10. An enthusiast-created modification was released that disabled the Windows Update check and allowed Windows 8.1 and earlier to continue to be updated on the platform. == Known issues == Kaby Lake has a critical flaw where some short loops may cause unpredictable system behavior. The issue can be fixed if the motherboard manufacturer releases a BIOS update with the fix.Critical Flaw In Intel Skylake And Kaby Lake HyperThreading Discovered Requiring BIOS Microcode Fix | HotHardware == TDP classification == Thermal design power (TDP) is the designed maximum heat generated by the chip running a specific workload at base clock. On a single microarchitecture, as the heat produced increases with voltage and frequency, this thermal design limit can also limit the maximum frequency of the processor. However, CPU testing and binning allows for products with lower voltage/power at a particular frequency, or higher frequency within the same power limit. Desktop processors: * High-power (K/X): ** For dual-core: 60 W ** For quad-core: 91 W (LGA1151) - 112W (LGA2066) * Medium-power: ** For dual-core: 51...54 W ** For quad-core: 65 W * Low-power (T): 35 W Mobile processors: * High-power (H): 45 W with configurable TDP-down to 35 W * Medium-power (U): 15...28 W with configurable TDP-down to 7.5 W * Low-power (Y): 5...7 W with configurable TDP-down to 3.5 W == List of 7th generation Kaby Lake processors == ===Desktop processors=== Features common to desktop Kaby Lake CPUs: * LGA 1151 socket (Except the Core i7 7740X and Core i5 7640X, which use the LGA 2066 socket.) * DMI 3.0 and PCIe 3.0 interfaces * Dual channel memory support in the following configurations: DDR3L-1600 1.35 V (32 GiB maximum) or DDR4-2400 1.2 V (64 GiB maximum) ** The Core i7 7740X and Core i5 7640x support DDR4-2666 (64 GiB maximum), but do not support DDR3L memory. * A total of 16 PCIe lanes * The Core-branded processors support the AVX2 instruction set. The Celeron and Pentium-branded ones support only SSE4.1/4.2. * 350 MHz base graphics clock rate ** The Core i7 7740X and Core i5 7640x do not have an integrated GPU. * No L4 cache (eDRAM) * A release date of January 3, 2017 (KBL-S) and June 2017 (KBL-X) {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | Processor branding ! rowspan=\"2\" | Model ! rowspan=\"2\" | Cores (threads) ! rowspan=\"2\" | CPU clock rate ! colspan=\"3\" |Turbo clock GHz Num of cores ! rowspan=\"2\" | GPU ! rowspan=\"2\" | Max GPU clock rate ! rowspan=\"2\" | L3 cache ! rowspan=\"2\" | TDP ! rowspan=\"2\" | Socket ! rowspan=\"2\" | Price (USD) |- ! 1 ! 2 ! 4 |- | rowspan=\"4\" | Core i7 |7740X | rowspan=\"4\" | 4 (8) | 4.3 GHz | 4.5 | 4.5 | 4.5 | colspan=\"2\" | rowspan=\"4\" | 8 MB | 112 W | LGA 2066 | rowspan=\"2\" | $350 |- |7700K | 4.2 GHz | 4.5 | 4.4 | 4.4 | rowspan=\"3\" | HD 630 | rowspan=\"3\" | 1150 MHz | 91 W | rowspan=\"3\" | LGA 1151 |- | 7700 | 3.6 GHz | 4.2 | 4.1 | 4.0 | 65 W | rowspan=\"2\" | $312 |- | 7700T | 2.9 GHz | 3.8 | 3.7 | 3.6 | 35 W |- | rowspan=\"8\" | Core i5 |7640X | rowspan=\"8\" | 4 (4) | 4.0 GHz | 4.2 | 4.2 | 4.0 | colspan=\"2\" | rowspan=\"8\"| 6 MB | 112 W | LGA 2066 | rowspan=\"2\" | $250 |- |7600K | 3.8 GHz | 4.2 | 4.1 | 4.0 | rowspan=\"18\" | HD 630 | rowspan=\"2\" | 1150 MHz | 91 W | rowspan=\"23\" | LGA 1151 |- | 7600 | 3.5 GHz | 4.1 | 4.0 | 3.9 | 65 W | rowspan=\"2\" | $224 |- | 7600T | 2.8 GHz | 3.7 | 3.6 | 3.5 | rowspan=\"3\" |1100 MHz | 35 W |- | 7500 | 3.4 GHz | 3.8 | 3.7 | 3.6 | 65 W | rowspan=\"2\" | $202 |- | 7500T | 2.7 GHz | 3.3 | 3.2 | 3.1 | 35 W |- | 7400 | 3.0 GHz | 3.5 | 3.4 |3.3 | rowspan=\"2\" |1000 MHz | 65 W | $182 |- | 7400T | 2.4 GHz | 3.0 |2.9 |2.7 | 35 W | $187 |- | rowspan=\"8\" | Core i3 |7350K | rowspan=\"13\" | 2 (4) | 4.2 GHz | rowspan=\"16\" colspan=\"3\" | rowspan=\"3\" |1150 MHz | rowspan=\"4\" | 4 MB | 60 W | $179 |- | 7320 | 4.1 GHz | rowspan=\"2\" | 51 W | $157 |- |7300 | 4.0 GHz | rowspan=\"2\" | $147 |- |7300T |3.5 GHz | rowspan=\"7\" |1100 MHz |35 W |- |7100 |3.9 GHz | rowspan=\"9\" |3 MB |51 W | rowspan=\"4\" |$117 |- |7100T |3.4 GHz |35 W |- |7101E |3.9 GHz |54 W |- |7101TE |3.4 GHz |35 W |- | rowspan=\"5\" |Pentium |G4620 |3.7 GHz | rowspan=\"2\" |51 W |$93 |- |G4600 |3.6 GHz |$82 |- |G4600T |3.0 GHz | rowspan=\"5\" |1050 MHz |35 W |$75 |- |G4560 |3.5 GHz | rowspan=\"5\" |HD 610 |54 W | rowspan=\"2\" |$64 |- |G4560T |2.9 GHz |35 W |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Celeron |G3950 | rowspan=\"3\" |2 (2) |3.0 GHz | rowspan=\"3\" |2 MB | rowspan=\"2\" |51 W |$52 |- |G3930 |2.9 GHz | rowspan=\"2\" |$42 |- |G3930T |2.7 GHz |1000 MHz |35 W |} ===Mobile processors=== ==== High power==== Maximum PCIe Lanes: 16.
