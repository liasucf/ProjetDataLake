    "text": "Willis Conway Pierce (December 2, 1895 \u2013 December 23, 1974) was an American chemist and professor at Pomona College and in the University of California system. ==Career== During World War I, Pierce served in the United States Army Chemical Corps. Pierce began teaching in 1920, at the University of Kentucky later teaching at University of South Dakota. He stayed on at the University of Chicago after receiving his Ph.D. to teach quantitative analysis. During this time he co-authored seminal chemistry textbook Quantitative Analysis with Edward Lauth Haenisch. Quantitative Analysis would go through 21 editions until 1963. During World War II, Pierce worked for the Office of Scientific Research and Development's National Defense Research Committee. Pierce had been recruited by his doctoral advisor, W. Albert Noyes, Jr., to join the \"division 10\" central laboratory at Northwestern University. Pierce's lab focused on chemical warfare defense and developed carbon filtering for use in chemical protective masks. Pierce's work included an assignment in Australia and the South Pacific. He was awarded the President's Certificate of Merit in 1948 for his services. From 1945 to 1953, Pierce served as the chair of the chemistry department at Pomona College. During this time, fellow chemistry professor and well-known practical joker R. Nelson Smith pranked Pierce by releasing several pigeons from the ceiling during one of Pierce's lectures. Pierce took the joke in stride by bringing a shotgun to the next class. Pierce would later co-author a chemistry textbook, Solving General Chemistry Problems, with Nelson. Pierce was recruited by Gordon S. Watkins to serve as the head of the Physical Sciences department at the then newly opened University of California, Riverside (UCR) in 1953. Pierce was awarded the 1963 Honor Scroll from the American Institute of Chemists for \"outstanding contributions to the training of chemists and the advancement of the profession.\" After retiring from UCR in 1965, Pierce provided input on University of California, Irvine's new chemistry building. Pierce Hall on UCR is named for him. ==References== Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:University of Chicago faculty Category:University of California, Riverside faculty Category:Georgetown College (Kentucky) alumni Category:20th- century American chemists Category:Pomona College faculty Category:University of South Dakota faculty Category:1895 births Category:1974 deaths Category:People from Carrollton, Kentucky Category:United States Army personnel Category:American military personnel of World War I Category:University of Kentucky faculty ",
