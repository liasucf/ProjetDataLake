    "text": "A geocode is a code that represents a geographic entity (location or object). It is a unique identifier of the entity, to distinguish it from others in a finite set of geographic entities. In general the geocode is a human-readable and short identifier. Typical geocodes and entities represented by it: * Country code and subdivision code. Polygon of the administrative boundaries of a country or a subdivision. The main examples are ISO codes: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code (e.g. `AF` for Afghanistan or `BR` for Brazil), and its subdivision conventions, such as `AF` subdivision codes (e.g. `AF-GHO` for Ghor province) or `BR` subdivision codes (e.g. `BR-AM` for Amazonas state). * DGG cell ID. Identifier of a cell of a discrete global grid: a Geohash code (e.g. ~0.023 km\u00b2 cell `6vjyngd` at the Brazilian's center) or an OLC code (e.g. ~0.004 km\u00b2 cell `58PJ642P+4` at the same point). * Postal code. Polygon of a postal area: a CEP code (e.g. `70040` represents a Brazilian's central area for postal distribution). Geocodes are mainly used (in general as an atomic data type) for labelling, data integrity, geotagging and spatial indexing. In theoretical computer science a geocode system is locality-preserving hashing function. == Classification == thumb|420px| Geocode cells of Geohash, with 8 (blue) and 9 (yellow) digits, a typical hierarchical grid, comparing with latitude-longitude (12 or more digits). A museum is a typical location to be pointed by a geocode, its gate need ~20 meters of precision. There are some common aspects of many geocodes (or geocode systems) that can be used as classification criteria: * Ownership: proprietary or free, differing by its licences. * Formation: the geocode can be originated from a name (ex. abbreviation of official name the country) or from mathematical function (encoding algorithm to compress latitude- longitude). See geocode system types below (of names and of grids). * Covering: global or partial. The entities (represented by the geocodes) are in all globe (e. g. geographical points) or is delimited the theme (e.g. only terrestrial areas) or by the ownership's jurisdiction (e.g. only into a country). * Type of the represented entity: type of geometry. Point (the geocode can be translated to a Geo URI), grid cell (the geocode system is related with a DGG) or polygon (typically administrative boundaries delimitations). ** special hierarchical grids, with global covering and equal-area cells, can be classified as DGGS cellThe OGS's standard \"Discrete Global Grid Systems\" definition. ** some non-standard geographic entities, can be classified also by its coordinate system and elipsoid of reference (e.g. UTM). The de facto standard is the WGS84.For internet formats and protocols, the WGS84 is de facto and de juri standard: see geo URI protocol, GeoJSON, GML and KML formats. * Scope of use: general use vs specialized (e.g. airport geocodes). * Hierarchy: geocode's syntax hierarchy corresponding to the spatial hierarchy of its represented entities. A geocode system can hierarchical (name or grid) or non-hierarchical. == Geocode system == The set of all geocodes used as unique identifiers of the cells of a full-coverage of the geographic surface (or any well-defined area like a country or the oceans), is a geocode system (also named geocode scheme). The syntax and semantic of the geocodes are also components of the system definition: * geocode syntax: the characters that can be used, blocks of characters and its size and order. Example: country codes use two letters of the alphabet (chacacter set A-Z). The most commom way to describe formally is by regular expression (e.g. `/[A-Z]{2,2}/`). * geocode semantic: the meaning of the geocode, usually expressed by associating the code with a geographical entity type. Can be described formally is by an ontology, an UML class diagram or any Entity-relationship model. In general the semantic can be deduced by its formation or encoding/decoding process. Example: each Geohash code can be expressed by a rectangular area in the map, and the rectangle coordinates is obtained by its decoding process. Many syntax and semantic characteristics are also summarized by classification. === Encode and decode === Any geocode can be translated from a formal (and expanded) expression of the geographical entity, or vice versa, the geocode translated to entity. The first is named encode process, the second decode. The actors and process involved, as defined by OGC,Definitions of the OGC's \"Glossary of Terms\". are: ;geocoder: A software agent that transforms the description of a geographic entity (e.g. location name or latitude/longitude coordinates), into a normalized data and encodes it as a geocode. ;geocoder service: A geocoder implemented as web service (or similar service interface), that accepts a set of geographic entity descriptors as input. The request is \"sent\" to the Geocoder Service, which processes the request and returns the resulting geocodes. More general services can also return geographic features (e.g. GeoJSON object) represented by the geocodes. ;geocoding: Geocoding refers to the assignment of geocodes or coordinates to geographically reference data provided in a textual format. Examples are the two letter country codes and coordinates computed from addresses. Note: when a physical addressing schemes (street name and house number) is expressed in a standardized and simplified way, it can be conceived as geocode. So, the term geocoding (used for addresses) sometimes is generalized for geocodes. In spatial indexing applications the geocode can also be translated between human-readable (e.g. hexadecimal) and internal (e.g. binary 64-bit unsigned integer) representations. === Systems of standard names === Geocodes like country codes, city codes, etc. comes from a table of official names, and the corresponding official codes and geometries (typically polygon of administrative areas). \"Official\" in the context of control and consensus, typically a table controlled by a standards organization or governmental authority. So, the most general case is a table of standard names and the corresponding standard codes (and its official geometries). Strictly speaking, the \"name\" related to a geocode is a toponym, and the table (e.g. toponym to standard code) is the resource for toponym resolution: is the relationship process, usually effectuated by a software agent, between a toponym and \"an unambiguous spatial footprint of the same place\". Any standardized system of toponym resolution, having codes or encoded abbreviations, can be used as geocode system. The \"resolver\" agent in this context is also a geocoder. ==== Hierarchical naming ==== Geocodes based on standard systems of hierarchical naming, mainly hierarchical administrative subdivision codes (HASC), are codes to represent names of country subdivisions, such as states, province, regions. They are described in the book Administrative Subdivisions of Countries: A Comprehensive World Reference, 1900 Through 1998, and other sources. The codes are alphabetic and have constant length for the first level subdivisions. Examples: :`DE` \\- Germany. A simple geocode. :`DE.NW` \\- North Rhine- Westphalia. A two-level hierarchical geocode. :`DE.NW.CE` \\- Kreis Coesfeld. A 3-level hierarchical geocode. Two geocodes of a hierarchical geocode system with same prefix represents different parts of the same location. For instance `DE.NW.CE` and `DE.NW.BN` represents geographically interior parts of `DE.NW`, the common prefix. === Systems of regular grids === British National Grid, generates hierarchical geocodes. Each cell subdivides recurrently its area into a new 10x10 grid. Inspired in the classic alphanumeric grids, a discrete global grid (DGG) is a regular mosaic which covers the entire Earth's surface (the globe). The regularity of the mosaic is defined by the use of cells of same shape in all the grid, or \"near the same shape and near same area\" in a region of interest, like a country. All cells of the grid have an identifier (DGG's cell ID), and the center of the cell can be used as reference for cell ID conversion into geographical point. When a compact human-readable expression of the cell ID is standardized, it becomes a geocode. Geocodes of different geocode systems can represent the same position in the globe, with same shape and precision, but differ in string-length, digit-alphabet, separators, etc. Non-global grids also differ by scope, and in general are geometrically optimized (avoid overlaps, gaps or loss of uniformity) for the local use. ==== Hierarchical grids ==== Each cell of a grid can be transformed into a new local grid, in a recurring process. In the illustrated example, the cell `TQ 2980` is a sub-cell of `TQ 28`, that is a sub-cell of `TQ`. A system of geographic regular grid references is the base of a hierarchical geocode system. Two geocodes of a hierarchical geocode grid system can use the prefix rule: geocodes with same prefix represents different parts of the same broader location. Using again the side illustration: `TQ 28` and `TQ 61` represents geographically interior parts of `TQ`, the commom prefix. Hierarchical geocode can be split into keys. The Geohash `6vd23gq` is the key `q` of the cell `6vd23g`, that is a cell of `6vd23` (key `g`), and so on, per-digit keys. The OLC `58PJ642P` is the key `48` of the cell `58PJ64`, that is a cell of `58Q8` (key `48`), and so on, two-digit keys. In the case of OLC there is a second key schema, after the `+` separator: `58PJ642P+48` is the key `2` of the cell `58PJ642P+4`. It uses two key schemas. Some geocodes systems (e.g. S2 geometry) also use initial prefix with non-hierarchical key schema. In general, as technical and non-compact optional representation, geocode systems (based on hierarchical grids) also offer the possibility of expressing their cell identifier with a fine-grained schema, by longer path of keys. For example, the Geohash `6vd2`, which is a base32 code, can be expanded to base4 `0312312002`, which is also a schema with per-digit keys. Geometrically, each Geohash cell is a rectangle that subdivides space recurrently into 4 new rectangles, so, base4 is the encoding-expansion limit.Note: in practical use Geohash can use base2, but geometrically it is based on latitude and longitude (2+2) partitions, so base2 can result in loss of symmetry. Strictly Geohash base32 also need two-digit keys for base4 compatibility. The uniformity of shape and area of cells in a grid can be important for other uses, like spatial statistics. There are standard ways to build a grid covering the entire globe with cells of equal area, regular shape and other properties: Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) is a series of discrete global grids satisfying all standardized requirements defined in 2017 by the OGC.\"Topic 21: Discrete Global Grid Systems Abstract Specification\", Open Geospatial Consortium (2017). https://docs.opengeospatial.org/as/15-104r5/15-104r5.html When human-readable codes obtained from cell identifiers of a DGGS are also standardized, it can be classified as DGGS based geocode system. === Name-and-grid systems === There are also mixed systems, using a syntactical partition, where for example the first part (code prefix) is a name-code and the other part (code suffix) is a grid-code. Example: : Mapcode entrance to the elevator of the Eiffel Tower in Paris is `FR-4J.Q2`, where `FR` is the name-code See formal use of ISO country codes in Mapcode at https://www.mapcode.com/territory and `4J.Q2` is the grid-code. Semantically France is the context, to obtain its local grid. For mnemonic coherent semantics, in fine-grained geocode applications, the mixed solutions are most suitable. == Shortening grid-based codes by context == Any geocode system based on regular grid, in general is also a shorter way of express a latitudinal/longitudinal coordinate. But more tham 6 digits geocode is difficult for remember. By other hand, a geocode based on standard name (or abbreviation or the complete name) is easy to remember. So, this suggest that a \"mixed code\" can be solve the problem, reducing the number of digits when a name can be used as \"context\" of the grid-based geocode. For example in book where the author say \"all geocodes here are contextualized by the chapter's country\". In fact a methodology exists for hierarchical grid- based geocodes with non-variable size, where the code prefix describes a broader area, which can be associated with a name. So, it is possible to shortening by replacing the prefix to the associated context. The most usual context is an official name. Examples: {|class=\"wikitable\" !Standards mixed !Grid-based !Mixed reference |- |Grid OLC and country's official names |`796RWF8Q+WF` |Cape Verde, Praia, `WF8Q+WF` |- |Grid Geohash and ISO 3166-2 hierarchical abbreviations |`e6xkbgxed` |`CV-PR`, `bgxed` |} The examples of the Mixed reference column are significantly easier than remembering DGG code column. The methods vary, for example OLC can be shortened the elimination of its first four digitshttps://github.com/google/open-location- code/wiki/Guidance-for-shortening-codes and using Plus Codes naming conventions.But PlusCodes is not an open-source algorithm, it uses a Black box, see https://stackoverflow.com/q/58489357/287948 When the mixed reference is also short (9 characters in the second example) and there are a syntax convention to express it (suppose `CP\u2011PR~bgxed`), this convention is generating a new name-and-grid geocode system. This is not the case of the first example because, strictly speaking, \"Cape Verde, Praia\" is not a code. To be both, a name-and-grid system and also a mixed reference convention, the system must be reversible. Pure name-and-grid systems, like Mapcode, with no way to transform it into a global code, is not a mixed reference, because there is no algorithm to transform the mixed geocode into a grid-based geocode. == Cataloged examples == This section lists most of the geocodes cataloged on Wikipedia, and shows a summarized description of each, based on the classification section. === In use, general scope === Geocodes in use and with general scope: {|class=\"wikitable\"| !Geocode !!Inception!!Coverage!!Formation!!Ownership!!Rep. entity!!Context and description |- |ISO 3166 (alpha-2 and alpha-3) || 1974 || globe/only nations || Name abbreviation || free || polygon | Administrative divisions.
