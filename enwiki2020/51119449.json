He is currently playing under contract with HC Plze\u0148 of the Czech Extraliga (ELH). ==Playing career== Morav\u010d\u00edk made his debut playing in Czech Extraliga with HC Plze\u0148 during the 2012\u201313 Czech Extraliga season. In the 2017\u201318 season, Morav\u010d\u00edk played in 52 games on the blueline for Plze\u0148, notching personal highs with 5 goals and 16 points and a plus-minus +25 rating. In the post-season he added three goals and 4 assists in 10 playoff games. On 28 May 2018, Morav\u010d\u00edk signed a two-year, entry-level contract with the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL). After attending the Canadiens training camp, Morav\u010d\u00edk was re-assigned to add depth to American Hockey League affiliate, the Laval Rocket for the 2018\u201319 season. Struggling to adjust to the North American style, he appeared in 20 games with the Rocket recording 3 points, while also experiencing a shortened stint with secondary affiliate the Brampton Beast of the ECHL. Upon his second re-assignment to the Beast, Morav\u010d\u00edk was placed on unconditional waivers, opting for a termination of his NHL contract with the Canadiens on January 28, 2019. As a free agent, Morav\u010d\u00edk immediately rejoined his former club HC Plze\u0148 for the remainder of the season, agreeing to an optional multi-year contract on January 30, 2019. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
