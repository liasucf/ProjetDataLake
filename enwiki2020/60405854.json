    "text": "The City (stylized in all-capital letters as THE CITY) is a non-profit news organization based in midtown Manhattan, New York, United States. It is a metro-specific website with an added focus on the five boroughs. The publication was founded in September 2018 and began publishing in February 2019. Its founding editor-in-chief is Jere Hester. Multiple donors have contributed to its initial $8.5 million funding. \"Reporting for New Yorkers\" is its slogan and its mascot is a pigeon named Nellie, in reference to the pioneering investigative journalist Nellie Bly. == History == === Office === The City occupies space on the fourth floor of a building in Koreatown. === Pre-website === The City was first announced on September 26, 2018, in a press release issued by the Charles H. Revson Foundation. The New York Times reported its announcement. The press release stated: In its release, the organization announced a collaboration with New York and in February 2019, The City began publishing stories on their Intelligencer blog. On Intelligencer, The City's inaugural stories looked into the persistence of racial discrimination by police in the Bronx, the suspension of the Housing Authority\u2019s elevator chief for making false maintenance claims, and the routinely broken subway escalators at the Hudson Yards station. === Post- website === On April 3, 2019, The City launched its website: thecity.nyc. The organization said it will focus on \"breaking news of importance to New Yorkers, from beat-driven enterprise stories to incisive investigative reports\" and telling \"neighborhood stories that transcend neighborhoods.\" In an interview with Columbia Journalism Review, when asked about the recent layoffs in local news-media, Hester said: \u201cFor years, it was death by a thousand cuts. Lately, it\u2019s become a bloodbath.\u201dhttps://thecity.nyc/about/us.html The City launched their website with reports on displacement that would result from the 2nd Avenue subway; the bloated costs of public restroom construction (a bathroom in a Bronx park cost taxpayers $4.7 million); and the city\u2019s failure to follow through on plans to furnish every public school classroom with air conditioning. Their work has prompted responses form politicians like Scott Stringer, Bill de Blasio and numerous elected city, and state, representatives. === Style === Deputy editor Alyssa Katz said she wanted every story to be an exclusive. \"Everything you\u2019re going to read in The City is going to be unique,\" said Katz, regarding their reporting and coverage. Some of their kickers and headlines have shown tabloid snark and witty quips. == Organization == Former CUNY Journalism director of news programs Jere Hester is its founding editor-in-chief. An NYU graduate, Hester spent 12 years at CUNY before founding The City. Prior to his time at CUNY, he spent 15 years at NY Daily News. Its current newsroom is staffed by journalists who've previously worked at DNA Info, WNYC, NY1, ProPublica, Chicago Tribune, NY Daily News, The Investigative Fund, NY Post, Politico, NBC News, Newsday, The Marshall Project and The Washington Post. Its deputy editors are former NY Daily News editorial board member Alyssa Katz and former NCBNewYork.com managing editor Hasani Gittens. The City's publisher in John Wotowicz, a former investment banker. === Directors === {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" ! ! ! |- |Ben Smith |Chairman |Editor-in-chief, Buzzfeed News |- |Sarah Bartlett | rowspan=\"12\" |Member |Dean, Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY |- |Mark Colodny |Managing Director, Warburg Pincus |- |Gary Ginsberg |Senior Vice President, SoftBank |- |Mark Winston Griffith |Executive Director, Brooklyn Movement Center |- |Darline Jean |Chief Digital Officer, Essence Communications Inc. |- |Rachel Lam |Co- founder, Imagination Capital |- |Elizabeth McNamara |Partner, Davis, Wright, Tremaine, LLP |- |Luis Miranda Jr. |Founding Partner, MiRam Consulting Group |- |Richard Ravitch |Former lieutenant governor of New York |- |Rob Speyer |President and CEO, Tishman Speyer |- |Jon Steinberg |CEO, Cheddar |- |John Thornton |Founder, Texas Tribune |} === Editor's council === {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" ! ! |- |Nicole Bode |CIVIL |- |Jim Dwyer | rowspan=\"2\" |New York Times |- |Sam Roberts |- |Nicole Gelinas |Manhattan Institute for Policy Research |- |Juan Gonz\u00e1lez |Democracy Now! |- |Elizabeth Green |CEO/co-founder of Chalkbeat |- |Anna Holmes |First Look Media |- |Debby Krenek |Publisher, Newsday |- |Brian Lehrer |WNYC |- |Tom McGeveran |Old Town Media |- |Adam Moss |New York |- |Richard Tofel |ProPublica |- |Errol Louis |NY1 |- |Tom Robbins |CUNY, The Marshall Project |} == Funding == The City is a non-profit, 501c3, venture and supported by donations and grants.
