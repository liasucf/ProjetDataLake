    "text": "Henry Braun (born c. 1950) is a Canadian politician and businessman. He is currently the mayor of Abbotsford, British Columbia. Braun was born in Paraguay where he lived with his family until he was three and a half, when they first moved to Steinbach, Manitoba and then to Abbotsford. His parents were Mennonite refugees from Ukraine who fled to Paraguay during World War II. Before entering politics, Braun was a rancher and the CEO Pacific Northern Rail Contractors Corp. Braun was first elected as a city councillor in Abbotsford in the 2011 municipal election. As a councillor, Braun was known for his lone opposing votes, with mayor Bruce Banman calling him \"(not) a team player\". He ran for mayor in 2014, defeating Banman by just over 600 votes. Braun ran on a platform of \"fiscal responsibility\" and \"better accountability\" in local government. He received some controversy in his run, as his son was director of development planning for the city, causing a possible conflict of interest. In his campaign, he won the endorsements of former mayors George Ferguson and Dave Kandal. Braun was easily re-elected as mayor in the 2018 mayoral election, defeating long-time city councillor Moe Gill and accountant Eric Nyvall, taking 57% of the vote. ==Personal life== Braun is married to Velma Braun, and has three children. ==External links== *City of Abbotsford biography ==References== Category:Living people Category:People from Abbotsford, British Columbia Category:Mayors of places in British Columbia Category:Businesspeople from British Columbia Category:Paraguayan emigrants to Canada Category:Canadian people of Ukrainian descent Category:Canadian ranchers Category:People from Steinbach, Manitoba Category:Canadian Mennonites Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
