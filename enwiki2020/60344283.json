The writer criticized the side story lines, which disrupted the main flow of the episode. In short, Kayla wrote, \"Perhaps most surprisingly, the episode never once feels like a gimmick or a tacky ploy for ratings that leans too confidently on the fact that people will watch just for the sake of the crossover. [...] The episode has some fun with it, but it\u2019s also not here just to play. It gets serious about institutionalized racism in a way that feels specific and personal while still tackling a lot at once.\" Reviewing the episode for Den of Geek, Kendall Williams rated it 4.5 out of 5 stars. He stated that he was personally involved with the installment as a black man, praising the depiction of racism and the irregularities of American law. Candice Horde of Tell-Tale TV gave the episode a 5/5 stars rating, commenting, \"I couldn\u2019t be any happier with this episode. What a masterful way to give the audience what we wanted with the crossover, continue to progress the plot, spearhead Annalise\u2019s characterization, and speak the nation\u2019s truth regarding the justice system\u2019s discriminatory practices.\" == References == Category:2018 American television episodes Category:How to Get Away with Murder Category:Television crossover episodes ",
