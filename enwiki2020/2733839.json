    "text": "Watt was a king in what is now the county of Sussex in southern England. His existence is attested by three charters that he witnessed, in the reign of No\u00f0helm, as Wattus Rex. He probably would have ruled between about AD 692 and 725 and there is some suggestion that he may have been King of the H\u00e6stingas. ==Charter evidence== Some of the Anglo-Saxon charters that date from the Kingdom of Sussex provide evidence which suggests the existence of two separate dynasties in Sussex. The charters of No\u00f0helm (or Nunna), who ruled Sussex in the late 7th and early 8th century regularly attest a second king by the name of Watt.Kelly. Charters of Selsey. p. lxxviCharter S.45 Northelm, king of South Saxons grants land to his sister. Retrieved 1 April 2013Charter S.1173 Bruni dux of South Saxons grants four hides to the Abbot of Selsey Retrieved 1 April 2013Charter S.43 Nunna, king of Sussex, to Eadberht, bishop; grant of 20 hides (tributarii) at Hugabeorgum and Dene. Retrieved 1 April 2013 Watt witnessed a charter from No\u00f0helm in 692, without any indication of his territory, he also witnessed (again as Wattus rex) a charter where Bruny (Bryni), dux of Sussex, grants to Eadberht, abbot of Selsey, 4 hides. The charter lacks a dating clause but as Eadberht was known to have been appointed bishop in 705 or slightly later, then the charter would have been created in 705 or slightly earlier. Watt is named as a witness on the charter together with Nunna.Kelly. Charters of Selsey. p. 23 Watt is also listed as a witness (as Uuattus rex) of another charter, erroneously dated 775, which is believed to be a late copy or forgery.West Sussex Records Office Cap/I/17/1. Retrieved 5 June 2017 ==King of the H\u00e6stingas== The historian C.T. Chevalier has suggested that Watt may have ruled the Haestingas tribe, which settled around the Hastings area of East Sussex. This is because place-names with the name Watt or What occur only in the Hastings area of Sussex.C.T. Chevalier. The Frankish origin of the Hastings tribe in Sussex Archaeological Collections Vol 104. pp. 56-62Martin Welch. Early Anglo-Saxon Sussex in Peter Brandon's. The South Saxons. pp. 23-25. The theory has been seen as plausible by other historians.R. Coates. On the alleged Frankish origin of the Hastings tribe in Sussex Archaeological Collections Vol 117. pp. 263-264 Chevalier goes on to suggest that the Haestingas may have been of Frankish origin, but other historians reject this part of the theory as it is based solely on a misinterpretation of the place-name evidence.Kelly.
