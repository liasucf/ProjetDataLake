The name is originally a possessive adjective, shortened from *\u017delim\u013ee (selo) (literally, '\u017delim\u044a's village'). Today the name is declined either as a neuter singular adjective (\u017del\u00edmlje -ega) or as a feminine plural noun (\u017del\u00edmlje -melj). The originally neuter singular adjective was reanalyzed as an accusative plural, and then as a feminine nominative plural. The personal name \u017delim\u044a is a hypocorism from a name such as *\u017delimir\u044a, preserved today in the Slovene name \u017deljko.Snoj, Marko. 2009.
