Lyrically, Logic discusses family issues and his thoughts on his current position in the rap industry, as well as addressing his detractors. ==Background and release== Logic recorded the song in summer 2017 while on tour. He announced the song a day before its release. In the accompanying snippet, Logic speaks to his hater, rapping: \"Can't let fame go to your head/ F--- with me watch where you tread/ I'm finna kill it instead\". The song features references to singers Katy Perry and Harry Styles. Logic's third studio album Everybody outsold Katy Perry's Witness and Harry Styles' self-titled solo debut album in its first week in the United States. \"Sold more albums my first week than Harry Styles and Katy Perry/If that ain't a sign of the times then I don't know what is, man this sh*t is scary,\" he raps. ==Composition== \"44 More\" features exactly 44 bars as well as an 808 beat laced with \"skittering\" hi-hats and synths, according to Rolling Stones Ryan Reed. The song samples \"Zoom\" by Future from the album Future (2017). ==Critical reception== Aron A. of HotNewHipHop praised the song, calling it a \"proof of [Logic's] abilities as an emcee\", writing: \"The production bangs heavy throughout this track and Logic showcases his slick wordplay and versatile flows throughout.\" Bianca Gracie of Fuse felt the song \"gives the mainstream side a different side of the rapper\" and thinks that it \"will earn respect from lovers of rap music\". Tony Centeno of Vibe complimented Logic for \"delivering a brand new extensive verse filled with nothing but rapid-fire wordplay\". ==Credit and personnel== Credits adapted from Tidal. * Logic \u2013 composition * Future \u2013 composition * 6ix \u2013 composition, production * Illmind \u2013 composition, uncredited co-production \"Overnight\" follows last week's release of \"44 More,\" produced by 6ix and !llmind. * Southside \u2013 composition * Eduardo Earle \u2013 composition * Bobby Campbell \u2013 mixing ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA) | 85 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ireland (IRMA) | 83 |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Heatseekers (RMNZ) | 2 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Sweden Heatseeker (Sverigetopplistan) | 1 |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal (AFP) | 1786 |} ==Certifications== ==References== Category:2018 singles Category:2018 songs Category:Logic (rapper) songs Category:Def Jam Recordings singles Category:Songs written by Southside (record producer) Category:Songs written by Illmind Category:Songs written by 6ix (record producer) Category:Songs written by Logic (rapper) ",
