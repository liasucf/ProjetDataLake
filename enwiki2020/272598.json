Retrieved 28 January 2010Wellingborough Geology Map . Retrieved 28 January 2010 In the predominantly agrarian medieval period, this combination of access to fertile, if flood-prone, valley bottom soils and drier (but heavier and more clay-rich) hillside/ hilltop soils seems to have been good for a mixed agricultural base. The clay-rich hilltop soils are primarily a consequence of blanketing of the area with boulder clay or glacial till during the recent glaciations.Borough Council of Wellingborough: Northamptonshire Geology . Retrieved 11 June 2010 On the valley sides and valley floor however, these deposits have been largely washed away in the late glacial period, and in the valley bottom extensive deposits of gravels were laid down, which have largely been exploited for building aggregate in the last century. === Iron ore === The most economically important aspect of the geology of the area is the Northampton Sands ironstone formation. This is a marine sand of Jurassic age (Bajocian stage), deposited as part of an estuary sequence and overlain by a sequence of limestones and mudrocks. Significant amounts of the sand have been replaced or displaced by iron minerals, giving an average ore grade of around 25 wt% iron. To the west the iron ores have been moderately exploited for a very long time, but their high phosphorus content made them difficult to smelt and produced iron of poor quality until the development of the Bessemer steel-making process and the \"basic slag\" smelting chemistry, which combine to make high-quality steelmaking possible from these unprepossessing ores. The Northampton Sands were a strategic resource for the United Kingdom in the run-up to World War II, being the best-developed bulk iron-producing processes wholly free from dependence on imported materials. However, because the Northampton Sands share in the regional dip of all the sediments of this part of Britain to the east- south-east, they become increasingly difficult to work as one progresses east across the county.Northants Geology Map .

Three narrow gauge tramways served the iron ore industry, the Wellingborough Tramway, Neilson's Tramway and the Finedonhill Tramway. The Wellingborough Tramway served Rixon's ironworks until 1966. === Climate === Wellingborough experiences an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification) which is similar to most of the British Isles. === Compass === Wellingborough's nearest towns are Rushden, Higham Ferrers and Irthlingborough. == Demography == Wellingborough's population expanded rapidly from the 1960s and 1970s as agreements were signed between the Urban District Council and London County Council and the Greater London Council for the town to re-house over-spill population from London.

Retrieved 23 August 2009 === Accent === The accent of a 21st century Wellingburian varies widely, the most common accent being very similar to London's, most likely due to the aforementioned London over-spill population, with elements and fusions of other ethnic accents, especially Jamaican. The fact that the town has a large Black Caribbean community significantly contributes to the accent. == Economy == The Swansgate Shopping Centre in 2008 Wellingborough has approximately 2,500 registered businesses within its boundaries.Connected Wellingborough: Opportunities.
