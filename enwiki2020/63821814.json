    "text": "The G\u00e5rdsnummer is the number of a farm unit in the Norwegian land register and it serves as the Assessor's parcel number. The modern abbreviation is Gnr, although the Norske Gaardnavne lists the abbreviation as GN. Each municipality will typically start with Gnr 1 and number each G\u00e5rd consecutively as needed. A farm is often divided into Bruksnummers, which begin again for each farm. This means that over time a larger farm has been divided into smaller units. ==Land Register Hierarchy== * - Fylkesnummer ** - Kommunenummer ***Gnr. \u2013 G\u00e5rdsnummer ****Bnr. \u2013 Bruksnummer *****Fnr. \u2013 Festenummer *****Snr. \u2013 Seksjonsnummer ==External Links== *Norwegian Farm Names *Oluf Rygh: Norwegian Farm Names *G\u00e5rdsmatrikkelen for 1886 *Matrikkelutkastet av 1950 Category:Nordic law Category:Scandinavian law Category:Norwegian law Category:Legal history of Norway ",
