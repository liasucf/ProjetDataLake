    "text": "The districts of the Church of the Brethren are 24 regional divisions that serve to administer around 1000 congregations of the Church of the Brethren in the United States and Puerto Rico. Districts are divided along state and county lines with membership and geographic scope varying widely. The Church of the Brethren is present in 34 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D. C. in addition to their overseas missions. ==History and purpose== The district system has existed amongst Schwarzenau Brethren since 1856\u2014prior to the 1881\u20131883 split\u2014and served the administrative purpose of determining delegates to the Annual Conference who could represent the interests of various communities and report back to them the proceedings. The Church of the Brethren is governed by a Congregationalist model of church polity, so most decisions are made locally by individual congregations without interference from any hierarchical structure. Delegates from districts serve the purpose of raising issues at Annual Conferences (called \"queries\") which affect the Church of the Brethren at large or which have a scope greater than that of a single congregation or locality\u2014e.g. the ordination of women or how to regulate funds for missions activities. Due to the increase in queries presented to the Annual Conference, in 1856, the Brethren approved the establishment of districts of no less than five churches that would answer queries that had a local scope. ==List of districts== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |-bgcolor=#cccccc !Name !class=\"unsortable\"|Territory(ies) !Congregations |- |Atlantic Northeast |Delaware (1), Maine (3), New Jersey (1), New York (3), Pennsylvania (71) |79 |- |Atlantic Southeast |Florida (19), Puerto Rico (9)Note that one Puerto Rican church\u2014located at Cipres Street 738 Highland Park in Rio Piedras, 00924-5139\u2014is not listed in this database, but can be found searching for Puerto Rican churches. |28 |- |Idaho |Idaho |6 |- |Illinois and Wisconsin |Illinois (38), Wisconsin (1) |39 |- |Michigan |Michigan |20 |- |Mid-Atlantic |Delaware (1), Maryland (46), Pennsylvania (2), Virginia (8), Washington, D.

Although most foreign missions closed by the middle of the 20th century, several remain worldwide. The most successful such mission has been (EYN) (Hausa for \"Church of the Children of the Same Mother\"), the Nigerian church which was granted autonomy in 1975. ===Current foreign missions=== ===Former foreign missions=== ;Canada :Alberta :*Arrowwood, Bow Valley (1917\u201368) :*Irricana (1910\u201368) :*Mountain View (1907\u201322) :*Pleasant Ridge (1908\u201317) :*Pleasant Valley (1909\u201320) :*Redcliffe Mission (1917\u2013?) :*Second Irricana (1924\u201364) :*Sharon (1906\u201317) :Saskatchewan :*Fairview (1903\u201333) :*Merrington (1920\u201349) :*Vidora: Battle Creek (1910\u201356) ;Mainland China :Guangdong :*On Fun, San Tai (1918\u201348) :Shanxi :*Tsin (Chin) Chou :*Liao Chou (1912\u201350) :*Ping Ting Choll (1912\u201350) :*Shou Yang Hsien (Show Yang) (1919\u201350) :*T'ai Yuan Fu (1923\u201350) ;Cuba :*Omaja (1908?\u201319) ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * * ==External links== *Church directory from the Church of the Brethren Category:Church of the Brethren Category:Protestantism-related lists Category:Denominational subdivisions in North America ",
