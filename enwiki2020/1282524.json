    "text": "Evening at Kessock Bridge The Kessock Bridge () carries the A9 trunk road across the Beauly Firth at Inverness, Scotland. ==Description== The Kessock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge across the Beauly Firth, an inlet of the Moray Firth, between the village of North Kessock and the city of Inverness in the Scottish Highlands. The bridge has a total length of with a main span of . Designed by German engineer Hellmut Homberg and built by Cleveland Bridge, it is similar to a bridge across the Rhine in D\u00fcsseldorf. The Beauly Firth is a navigable waterway and hence the bridge is raised high over sea level. The four bridge towers dominate the Inverness skyline, especially at night when they are lit. The bridge carries the A9 trunk road north from Inverness to the Black Isle. It is the southernmost of the \"Three Firths\" crossings (Beauly, Cromarty and Dornoch) which has transformed road transport in the Highlands. It has proved a key factor in the growth of the city of Inverness. To protect against any potential seismic activity of the Great Glen Fault, the bridge includes seismic buffers in its construction. These buffers are at the north abutment, nearly over the line of the fault, and they supplement longitudinal restraint at Pier 7, the south main pier. Each buffer is just over long and weighs about . On the south side of the bridge is the Caledonian Stadium, home of Inverness Caledonian Thistle ==History== Prior to 1982, travellers north of Inverness had the choice of the Kessock Ferry or a journey via Beauly. Cleveland Bridge were awarded the \u00a317.5million contract in 1975 (). Construction on the bridge began in 1976, with completion and opening in 1982. It won the combined design and construction Saltire Award. Transport Scotland estimated in 2012 that 30,000 vehicles per day were using the bridge. Since 2007, the 25th anniversary of it opening, the Kessock Bridge has featured on the obverse of the \u00a3100 note issued by the Bank of Scotland. The series of notes commemorates Scottish engineering achievements with illustrations of bridges in Scotland such as the Glenfinnan Viaduct and the Forth Bridge. The bridge was resurfaced from February to June 2013. The 20-week programme on the bridge's southbound carriageway will see Stirling Lloyd fulfil all preparation, waterproofing and resurfacing work using the Eliminator bridge deck waterproofing systemEliminator-bridge-deck-waterproofing-membrane combined with Gussasphalt, supplied by Stirling Lloyd's partners Aeschlimann AG. The project was managed by Stirling Lloyd's Darren Holmes, the improvement programme, being carried out on behalf of Transport Scotland, will, once completed, give the bridge deck surfacing a predicted life expectancy of over 30 years. In 2019, the bridge was awarded a Category B listed status by Historic Environment Scotland. ==See also== * Banknotes of Scotland (featured on design) ==References== ==External links== * Bridges of Inverness: Kessock Bridge * Eliminator-Datasheet Category:Bridges completed in 1982 Category:Bridges in Highland (council area) Category:Cable-stayed bridges in Scotland Category:Road bridges in Scotland Category:Transport in Highland (council area) Category:1982 establishments in Scotland Category:Black Isle Category:Buildings and structures in Inverness Category:Category B listed buildings in Highland (council area) ",
