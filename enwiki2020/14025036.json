    "text": "American Jewish Congress v. Bost is an establishment clause lawsuit concerning the separation of church and state in Brenham, Texas. The case is the first constitutional challenge to a charitable choice contract. ==History== In the community of Brenham, Texas, the American Jewish Congress and the Texas Civil Rights Project filed a lawsuit against a social services program who they believe used a tax funded jobs program to support religious practices which violated the separation of church and state. Other accusations include; use of funds to proselytize, purchase bibles, and coerce participants to \"accept Jesus.\" On May 21, 2002, the Houston Chronicle reported that the case would be sent to federal district court. ==NGO reports== The Rockefeller Institute of Government reported that the lawsuit is a response to the 1996 gathering of a number of churches and businesses in Brenham, Texas, that formed the \"Jobs Partnership of Washington County,\" a program which has come under legal scrutiny. The Texas Freedom Network, a nonpartisan organization, reports that, \"The religious message seemed to have a coercive impact on clients. About one- third of the participants said in the program evaluation that they felt pressure to join the host church, Grace Fellowship Baptist Church.\" ==Final ruling== The lawsuit went back and forth between state and federal courts and was twice appealed. In January 2003, the lawsuit that is believed to the first constitutional challenge to a \u201ccharitable choice\u201d contract, came to a conclusion. The case was finally dismissed, \"on the ground that there was no live controversy.\" ==See also== *History of the Jews in Brenham, Texas ==References== Category:Jews and Judaism in Brenham, Texas Category:Legal history of Texas Category:American Jewish Congress Category:Establishment Clause case law Category:Law articles needing an infobox Category:2003 in United States case law Category:2003 in religion Category:2003 in Texas ",
