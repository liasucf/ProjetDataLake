The first commercial applications was by Star TV in Asia and Galaxy in Australia, enabling digitally broadcast, satellite-delivered Television to the public. It is used via satellites serving every continent of the world. DVB-S is used in both Multiple Channel Per Carrier (MCPC) and Single channel per carrier modes for Broadcast Network feeds as well as for direct-broadcast satellite services like Sky (UK & Ireland) via Astra in Europe, Dish Network and Globecast in the U.S. and Bell Satellite TV in Canada. While the actual DVB-S standard only specifies physical link characteristics and framing, the overlaid transport stream delivered by DVB-S is mandated as MPEG-2, known as MPEG transport stream (MPEG-TS). Some amateur television repeaters also use this mode in the 1.2 GHz amateur band. ==References== ==External links== * ETSI DVB-S/S2 * DVB-S TR 101 198 V1.1.1 (09/97) Implementation of Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation in DVB satellite transmission systems * DVB-S EN 300 421 V1.1.2 (08/97) Framing structure, channel coding and modulation for 11/12 GHz satellite services * Irdeto history Category:Digital Video Broadcasting Category:Satellite broadcasting Category:Television transmission standards ",
