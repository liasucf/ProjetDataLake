    "text": "TAM 2012. Paranormal challenges, often posed by groups or individuals who self-identify as skeptics or rationalists, publicly challenge those who claim to possess paranormal abilities to demonstrate that they in fact possess them, and are not fraudulent or self-deceptive. == Process == Czech Skeptics' Club Sisyfos offers \u20ac125,000 to anyone who can prove paranormal phenomena. After establishing procedures and measures of success agreed upon beforehand between the challengers and the claimants, a challenge is usually divided into two steps, the first being a \"preliminary test\" or \"pre-test\", where claimants can show their purported abilities under controlled conditions before a small audience, before being admitted to the final test. Sometimes these pre-tests have a smaller prize attached to them. Several local organisations have set up challenges that serve as pre-tests to larger prizes such as the JREF's One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge or the 2012\u20132013 SKEPP Sisyphus Prize (for one million euros). == History == In 1922, Scientific American made two US$2,500 offers: (1), for the first authentic spirit photograph made under test conditions, and (2), for the first psychic to produce a \"visible psychic manifestation.\" Harry Houdini was a member of the investigating committee. The first medium to be tested was George Valiantine, who claimed that in his presence spirits would speak through a trumpet that floated around a darkened room. For the test, Valiantine was placed in a room, the lights were extinguished, but unbeknownst to him his chair had been rigged to light a signal in an adjoining room if he left his seat. Because the light signals were tripped during his performance, Valiantine did not collect the award. Since then, many individuals and groups have offered similar monetary awards for proof of the paranormal in an observed setting. Indian rationalist Abraham Kovoor's challenge in 1963 inspired American skeptic James Randi's prize in 1964, which became the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge. In 2003, these prizes were calculated to have a combined value of US$2,326,500. , none of the prizes have been awarded. The James Randi paranormal challenge was officially terminated in 2015.The Million Dollar Challenge As of 2018, these prizes combine to approximately US$1,024,215. However, they take place in multiple countries and the conditions to be met may vary considerably. == List of standing prizes == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"border:1px; background:#f7f8ff; margin:auto\" cellpadding=\"7\" |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#e6e9ff\" !| Date !!| Location !!| Challengers !!| Offered prize !!| Equivalent in U.S. dollars !!| Details !!| Status |- | 2014\u2013 || Czech Republic|| Czech Skeptics' Club Sisyfos || 3,425,000 Czech koruna || $160,671 || To anyone who can prove to possess paranormal abilities in areas such as clairvoyance, telepathy, telekinesis, rhabdomancy, etc. || Unclaimed |- | 1999\u2013 || China || Sima Nan || 1,000,000 Chinese yuan || $157,913 || \"[T]o anyone who can perform one act of \"special ability\u201d without cheating.\" || Unclaimed |- | 1984\u2013 || India || Tarksheel Society || 10,000,000 Indian rupees || $150,110 || To anyone who can perform any of 22 specified \"miracles\".
