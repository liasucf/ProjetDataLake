    "text": "Y\u0101ma is the third of the six heavenly worlds of the desire realm in Buddhist cosmology. It is located between Tr\u0101yastri\u1e43\u015ba and Tushita. This world is variously translated as \"wonderful times\", \"virtuous\", \"excellent times\" or \"of the hours.\" It is said that the Y\u0101ma heaven is always illuminated so that there is no division of day and night. The gods here enjoy satisfaction of the five desires, which arise in relation to the five sense organs. ==Etymology== Y\u0101ma is a Sanskrit technical term referring to a measurement of time, similar to a \"watch\" in English. A 24-hour day is divided into eight three-hour \"watches\", which makes a y\u0101ma equal to 1/4 of a day or night. An equivalent unit of time is a prahar, which is synonymous with the modern pahar. A Chinese text referred to as the Sse-kiau-tsih reads that the gods of this world distinguish time by the opening and shutting of flowers. There are several Chinese translations of the name Y\u0101ma, including but not limited to \u7130\u6469\u5929, \u591c\u6469\u5929 \u5531\u6a02\u5929, \u6642\u5206\u5929 and \u708e\u9b54. ==Descriptions== Y\u0101ma is the first heaven that functions as a disconnect between the swarga heavens and the human realm. The deities here are not involved in conflict with the asuras and are said to \"have arrived at divine bliss\" (dibba\u1e43 sukha\u1e43) (Vibh-a 18:6,1). According to the Visakhuposatha Sutta of the P\u0101li Canon, time there runs very differently than on Earth: \"That which among men is two hundred years...is one night and day of the Y\u0101ma devas, their month has thirty of those days, their year twelve of those months; the lifespan of the Y\u0101ma devas is two thousand of those heavenly years.\" A month in this world may be calculated to be 6,000 human years. A Y\u0101ma deva year is 72,000 years, and a Y\u0101ma deva lifespan is 144,000,000 years. According to the D\u0101na Sutta, those who practice generosity with the intention of continuing a family custom of such deeds create the karmic conditions to be reborn in Y\u0101ma Heaven. ===Mah\u0101y\u0101na=== The Amit\u0101yurdhy\u0101na S\u016btra provides a few further details. Y\u0101ma Heaven includes the river Jamb\u016b, and a celestial palace that features a canopy decorated with five hundred million jewels, compared with that found in Amit\u0101bha's Pure Land. According to the Avata\u1e43saka S\u016btra in 60 fascicles, bodhisattvas of the fourth stage may become the ruler of this heaven. ==See also== * Yama (Buddhism) - An arguably unrelated deity in the Buddhist pantheon * Third Heaven ==References== Category:Buddhist cosmology ",
