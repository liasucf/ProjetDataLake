    "text": "The Apartment (Season 1) was the first season of the Asian reality television show The Apartment which after six seasons is the longest running reality competition television show in Asia. The concept of the first season was that three teams cooperate to design one room each week for eight weeks. The host of the programme, Kahi Lee, gave the challenge and a panel including Martin Haeger and Alice Nguyen would judge their work. The final winners were announced after the last episode, and the prize was their own apartment in The Quarza in Kuala Lumpur. The show was created by Riaz Mehta and produced by Singapore-based Imagine Group. The winners of this season were Syed and Rodrigo. == Contestants == Syed and Rodrigo (housemates) Jeremy and Renai (couple) Michael and Artika (friends) ==References== ==External links== Category:2013 television series debuts Category:Home renovation television series Category:2013 television series endings ",
