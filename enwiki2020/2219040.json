    "text": "The Las Vegas Thunder was a professional ice hockey team competing in the International Hockey League. The team's home rink was at the Thomas & Mack Center. They began play in the 1993\u20131994 season, folding on April 18, 1999. The demise of the franchise was precipitated by the refusal of UNLV officials to negotiate with team owners regarding a new agreement to continue playing at the Thomas & Mack after the 1998-'99 season. Without a facility that was suitable even for temporary use, the Thunder were forced to shut down. ==History== The Thunder made a strong showing in their first season, finishing with the best record in the league\u2013115 points and a 52-18-11 record. They topped that performance in 1995\u20131996 when they again finished with the league's best record (122 points, 57-17-8). The Thunder lost in the conference finals that season. Throughout the team's history they garnered player development deals with the Phoenix Coyotes of the NHL, the ECHL's Knoxville Cherokees and Mississippi Sea Wolves and Russian side Lokomotiv Yaroslavl. The Thunder's main rivals included the Denver/Utah Grizzlies, Los Angeles/Long Beach Ice Dogs, San Diego Gulls, and Phoenix Roadrunners. These rivalries later saw a rebirth in the ECHL with the Las Vegas Wranglers. The team's mascot was \"Boom-Boom\", a polar bear.
