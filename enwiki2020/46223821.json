The GA18 was a derivative of the EMD G18 and was designed as an extremely light locomotive with low axle loading which used freight car trucks driven by cardan shafts and two traction motors attached to the underframe. It is the successor model of the EMD GA8. They are powered by an EMD 8-645E prime mover rated at 1100 bhp and 1000 hp for traction.
