It began in August 2016 and ended in May 2017. ==Changes== The league remained at 17 teams. All twelve 2016\u201317 Scottish Premiership clubs participated in the league, with Dundee United, Dunfermline Athletic, Falkirk, Hibernian and St Mirren making up the numbers. Eligible players were those born in 1997 or later, but five players of any age were permitted in the matchday squad of 18. ==League table== ==Matches== Teams played each other twice, once at home, once away. The result of a match between Dunfermline and Motherwell on 21 February was annulled, and a 3\u20130 win awarded to Motherwell, because Dunfermline fielded a player who was under suspension from the Scottish Football Association. ==Top scorers== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Rank !Player !Club !Goals |- |1 |align=\"left\"| Oli Shaw |align=\"left\"|Hibernian |26 |- |2 |align=\"left\"| Ryan Tierney |align=\"left\"|Hamilton Academical |19 |- |3 |align=\"left\"| Neil McLaughlin |align=\"left\"|Partick Thistle |17 |- |4 |align=\"left\"| Scott Shepherd |align=\"left\"|Falkirk |15 |- |5 |align=\"left\"| Greg Morrison |align=\"left\"|Ross County |14 |} ==References== ==External links== *SPFL Development Category:SPFL Development League ",
