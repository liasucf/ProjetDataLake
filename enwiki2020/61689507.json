    "text": "{| |} The future BRP Antonio Luna (FF-151) is the second ship of the Jose Rizal-class frigate, ordered for future service with the Philippine Navy. The frigate is expected to be delivered to the Philippine Navy by September 2020, and will become one of the service's primary warship until the introduction of new and more powerful contemporaries. ==Construction and design== BRP Antonio Luna was designed and built by south korean shipbuilder Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI). She was based on the \"HDF-2600 Frigate Design\", which in turn was derived from the Incheon-class frigate of the Republic of Korea Navy (ROKN). Changes were made on the base design by making use of features found on newer frigates of the ROKN like the Daegu-class frigate, considering reduced radar cross-section by having cleaner lines and smooth surface design, as well as reduced overhangs. She also features a low free-board design similar also to the Royal Thai Navy frigate HTMS Bhumibol Adulyadej. Temporary hull number P160 was assigned to her during construction by HHI, with the steel cutting ceremony held on 17 September 2018 in HHI's shipyard in Ulsan, South Korea. The keel laying ceremony was held on 23 May 2019. The launching ceremony happened on 8 November 2019. The ship is expected to be delivered to the Philippine Navy by September 2020 and be commissioned on November 2020. ==See also== * * List of ships of the Philippine Navy == References == Category:Philippine Navy Category:2019 ships ",
