Gunby Hall, Montgomery-Massingberd's home in Lincolnshire He was appointed Chief of the Imperial General Staff in February 1933. Among his main achievements at this time was the mechanising of the cavalry:Montgomery-Massingberd, Hugh, p. 18 indeed he was the driving force behind the formation of a permanent \"Mobile Division\". Despite this, according to Williamson and Millett, he was a great obstacle to innovation of mechanized forces and suppressed the analysis of the British Army's performance in the First World War initiated by his predecessor, Lord Milne.Murray, Williamson & Millett, Allen R. Advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the King's Birthday Honours 1934, he was made a field marshal on 7 June 1935.

In retirement he became Deputy Lieutenant and then Vice-Lieutenant of the County of Lincoln. During the Second World War the Air Ministry attempted to build an airfield at Great Steeping in Lincolnshire that would have extended into Sir Archibald's wife's traditional family estate, necessitating the demolition of the magnificent mansion of Gunby Hall. He personally appealed to King George VI and the Air Ministry relented, redrawing the plans that resulted in the resiting of the new RAF Spilsby two miles further south. During the Second World War he also took charge of organizing and recruiting the Home Guard in Lincolnshire for nine months. His major passion in life was horsemanship. He died at his home, Gunby Hall, on 13 October 1947 and was buried at St. Peter's Church in Gunby. ==Family== In 1896 Archibald Montgomery married Diana Langton Massingberd. They had no children. In October 1926, his wife inherited Massingberd family estates, and he changed his name by Royal Licence to add her name to his own. Thus, references to him as \"Montgomery-Massingberd\" during the First World War are anachronistic. The journalist and genealogist Hugh Massingberd was a great-nephew of both the Field Marshal and, independently, the Field Marshal's wife, and in 1963 he and his father also adopted the Massingberd name to inherit the same estates. ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * * ==External links== * |- |- |- Category:1871 births Category:1947 deaths Category:People from Fivemiletown Category:Graduates of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich Category:People educated at Charterhouse School Category:British field marshals Category:British Army personnel of the Second Boer War Category:British Army personnel of World War I Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath Category:Knights Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order Category:Royal Artillery officers Category:Chiefs of the Imperial General Staff Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Service Medal (US Army) Category:Graduates of the Staff College, Camberley Category:People from Spilsby Category:Foreign recipients of the Distinguished Service Medal (United States) ",
