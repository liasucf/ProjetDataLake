Extending this idea, he posited that, if training in karate in a natural way leads one to mastery of one's body, knowledge and experience are vastly increased and the foundation for naturally living a moral life is established. For this reason Konishi named his own style Shind\u014d jinen-ry\u016b (\"godly, natural style, complete empty-handed way\").Shindo Jinen-Ryu by Howard High at Dragon Times == Characteristics == Shindo Jinen Ryu training has three main elements: kihon (basics), kata (forms or patterns of moves) and kumite (sparring). It incorporates elements of karate, aikido, jujitsu and kendo in its curriculum and also emphasizes both philosophy and education.Welcome! at Japan Karate-Do Ryobu-Kai Saint Louis The strong influences of both Gichin Funakoshi and Kenwa Mabuni are apparent in the style. The catalog of stances and techniques is equally broad, subsuming methods from both Shotokan and Shito-Ryu. There is a strong focus on practicality and an approach that often combines entering strikes with finishing takedowns. == Kata == Shindo Jinen Ryu has a large repertoire of kata, incorporating variations on the Shotokan catalog, a number of Shito-Ryu forms and a number of kata that are exclusive to Shindo Jinen Ryu. Kobudo is also part of this element of the style's curriculum. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Traditional Katas !! Standard Katas !! Kobudo !!
