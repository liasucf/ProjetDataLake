In the 1st century BC, the Romans took possession, and have left numerous archeological and cultural artifacts. The Croats arrived in the 7th century along with the great migration and settled in the area. The island was for some time under the rule of the Croatian kingdom. Yet the island was always fought over, and in the 11th and 12th centuries was divided between the communities of Rab (Arbe) and of Zadar (Zara). From the 12th to 14th centuries, Pag, along with other Dalmatian islands and towns, was fiercely contested between the Republic of Venice and the Croatian-Hungarian rulers. For four centuries from the start of the 15th century, it was held by Venice, until Venice lost its independence in 1797. Austria and France then fought over Dalmatia with victory going to the Austrians. The island passed from Austria-Hungary to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia after World War I, and then to the Independent State of Croatia (1941\u201345), when the Ustashe set up concentration camps at Slana and Metajna, where they killed thousands of Serbs, Jews and Croatian anti-fascists. After the Second World War it returned to Yugoslavia and, after the dissolution of Yugoslavia in 1991, the island became part of the Republic of Croatia. ==Economy== The first Croatian wind farm was constructed on Pag island, just northeast of Pag town. The 5.95 MW \"Vjetroelektrana Ravna 1\" wind farm is composed of seven Vestas V52 wind turbines and has operated since 2004. Throughout its history, Pag has been connected with salt production, a traditional activity that has been practiced for more than a thousand years. While the earliest historical records of salt production on the island date to 999, it is believed salt was produced on Pag in Roman times. The origin of the town of Pag is connected with the exploitation of natural suitably shallow coves within the closed bay (the so-called Valle di Pago) for salt manufacturing. ==Notable people== *Bartol Ka\u0161i\u0107 (August 15, 1575 \u2013 December 28, 1650) was a Jesuit clergyman and grammarian during the Counter-Reformation, who wrote the first Croatian grammar and translated the Bible and the Roman Rite into Croatian. ==See also== * Pag cheese * Pag lace * Pag Triangle ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:Islands of Croatia Category:Islands of the Adriatic Sea Category:Landforms of Lika-Senj County Category:Landforms of Zadar County ",
