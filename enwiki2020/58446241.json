He said: \"I was asked to produce Nur 2, because people wanted to know what happened to Nur and Hamadi. However I thought that in general any piece of work should not be extended just because it received a good response. After many had requested for it to be produced, including the TV3, I finally got involved. I then had a new storyline and presented to the station. They are confident and agree with the story.\" Nur 2 is co-produced by iflix and available to stream for free. ==References== Category:2018 Malaysian television series debuts Category:2010s Malaysian television series Category:Malaysian television series Category:TV3 (Malaysia) original programming ",
