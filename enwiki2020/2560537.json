    "text": "Indene is a flammable polycyclic hydrocarbon with chemical formula C9H8. It is composed of a benzene ring fused with a cyclopentene ring. This aromatic liquid is colorless although samples often are pale yellow. The principal industrial use of indene is in the production of indene/coumarone thermoplastic resins. Substituted indenes and their closely related indane derivatives are important structural motifs found in many natural products and biologically active molecules, such as sulindac. ==Isolation== Indene occurs naturally in coal-tar fractions boiling around 175\u2013185 \u00b0C. It can be obtained by heating this fraction with sodium to precipitate solid \"sodio-indene.\" This step exploits indene's weak acidity evidenced by its deprotonation by sodium to give the indenyl derivative. The sodio-indene is converted back to indene by steam distillation.Gerd Collin, Rolf Mildenberg, Mechthild Zander, Hartmut H\u00f6ke, William McKillip, Werner Freitag, Wolfgang Im\u00f6hl \u201cResins, Synthetic\u201d Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2000. ==Reactivity== Indene readily polymerises. Oxidation of indene with acid dichromate yields homophthalic acid (o-carboxylphenylacetic acid). It condenses with diethyl oxalate in the presence of sodium ethoxide to form indene-oxalic ester, and with aldehydes or ketones in the presence of alkali to form benzofulvenes. The latter are highly coloured. Treatment of indene with organolithium reagents give lithium indenyl compounds: :C9H8 \\+ RLi \u2192 LiC9H7 \\+ RH Indenyl is a ligand in organometallic chemistry, giving rise to many transition metal indenyl complexes. == See also == * Indane * Indole * Isoindene * Indenyl effect * Indenone ==References== ==External links== * * * ",
