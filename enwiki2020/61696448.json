    "text": "The Cream is a live album by blues musician John Lee Hooker recorded in California in 1977 and released by the Tomato label in 1978. ==Reception== AllMusic reviewer Alex Henderson stated: \"Joined by a full band that includes two other guitarists, John Lee Hooker is passionately rockin' on this live date recorded at the Keystone in Palo Alto, California in 1977. Hooker has always been known for taking quite a few liberties with his material, something that could easily throw some musicians off. Without a doubt, he keeps sidemen on their toesand he presents even more of a challenge on-stage because there are no second and third takes. But this is a band that, although not in a class with Canned Heat, obviously understands (and even thrives on) his sense of spontaneity, and rises to the occasion... Hooker doesn't do as much improvising as he did when playing unaccompanied at New York's Hunter College the previous year, but he never ceases to be confidently soulful. Although not quite essential, The Cream is an engaging LP that definitely has a lot going for it\". ==Track listing== All compositions credited to John Lee Hooker # \"Hey, Hey\" \u2013 5:48 # \"Rock Steady\" \u2013 6:53 # \"Tupelo\" \u2013 6:27 # \"You Know It Ain't Right\" \u2013 4:22 # \"She's Gone\" \u2013 5:47 # \"T.B.
