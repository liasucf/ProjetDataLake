The Dodgers' record for 1969 was 85\u201377, which was nine wins better than 1968. == Offseason == * October 21, 1968: Bob Bailey was purchased from the Dodgers by the Montreal Expos.Bob Bailey page at Baseball Reference * October 21, 1968: Jim Ellis was traded by the Dodgers to St. Louis Cardinals for Pete Mikkelsen.Pete Mikkelsen page at Baseball Reference * December 4, 1968: Mike Kekich was traded by the Dodgers to the New York Yankees for Andy Kosco.Mike Kekich page at Baseball Reference * December 5, 1968: Jim Campanis was acquired from the Dodgers by the Kansas City Royals.Jim Campanis page at Baseball Reference * March 30, 1969: Ted Savage was traded by the Dodgers to the Cincinnati Reds for Jimmie Schaffer.Ted Savage page at Baseball Reference == Regular season == After finishing 8th in 1967 and 7th in 1968, the Dodgers looked to improve in 1969 with the addition of youngsters Ted Sizemore, Bill Sudakis, and by obtaining Tom Haller in a trade. The Dodgers started fast and on June 10, they were in 2nd place at 31\u201322, 1 game back in a wild 5 team N.L. West race. On June 11, they reacquired Maury Wills in a trade, and obtained Manny Mota in the same deal for Ron Fairly and Paul Popovich. By July 16, they were in 1st place, and after beating the Mets on September 3, they were in second place, 1 game back. Centerfielder Willie Davis had just extended his club record 31 game hitting streak. They headed to San Diego to face the expansion Padres in a 4-game series and disaster struck. They scored 4 runs in 4 games, lost 4 in a row, and Davis had his hitting streak stopped in the first game. They left San Diego in 4th place, still only 2\u00bd games out. They rebounded somewhat, and when they beat the Atlanta Braves on September 18, they were one-half game behind co-leaders Atlanta and the San Francisco Giants as they headed to San Francisco. The pressure of the season long 5 team pennant race got to this young team, as they lost 10 of their next 11 games, ultimately finishing 85\u201377, 8 games behind division winning Atlanta. ===Impact=== While they did not win the division, the 1969 Dodgers marked the start of a turnaround for the franchise. After finishing 8th and 7th in 1967 and 1968 respectively, they would not finish in the bottom half of the standings again until 1984. Ted Sizemore won the rookie of the year award, and other youngsters like Steve Garvey, Bill Russell, Von Joshua, Bobby Valentine, and Bill Buckner contributed in back up roles. Waiting in the wings in the minors were Ron Cey, Davey Lopes, Tom Paciorek, and manager Tommy Lasorda. === Season standings === === Record vs. opponents === === Opening Day lineup === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\" |+ !
