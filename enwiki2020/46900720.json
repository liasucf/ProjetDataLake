Print. was a folk and gospel musician who played to small, Midwestern towns in the 1940s and 1950s. As a musician, very little is known about Whitfield, as he has only a few surviving recordings - none of which were very popular during his tenure. However, he has influenced a small number of musicians, mostly in Kansas and Oklahoma. Whitfield's musical career was likely hindered by extensive legal troubles, as he was wanted in several counties across the U. S. for vice crimes.Parsons, Larry. \"Outlaw Folk Singer on the Run.\" Ottawa County Beacon Miami, Oklahoma. September 3, 1946. A11.
