In this sense, the word is a portmanteau of technophile and metrosexual, which was first promoted by creative professional Ricky Montalvo to describe \"a dandyish narcissist in love with not only himself, but also his urban lifestyle and gadgets; a straight man who is in touch with his feminine side but has fondness for electronics such as cell phones, PDAs, computers, software, and the web.\"\"Word Spy contributors\" (2004) Technosexual wordspy.com # has a sexual attraction to machinery, as in the case of robot fetishism. When used thus, it is a portmanteau word combining \"technophile\" and \"sexual\". As per this definition of the term, fictional android Gigolo Joe, played by Jude Law in the 2001 science-fiction film A.I. has become the iconic \"technosex symbol\". As with the metrosexual, companies have tried to promote the concept of the technosexual in order to sell products. Calvin Klein went as far as trademarking the term \"technosexual\" in 2005. ==See also== *Arse Elektronika *Gynoid *Mechanophilia *Her (film) *Lars and the Real Girl (film) *Ex Machina (film) ==References== ==External links== * Gore, Edward (2002).
