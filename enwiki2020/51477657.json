The collection includes significant holdings in western landscape painting, Navajo rugs, and Ancestral Puebloan pottery. A rich assortment of media make up the collection, from oil and acrylic to bronze, serigraphs, lithographs and etchings. The collection features many local artists from the mid-20th century to the present day, including several Art Center founders. The two most represented artists are Alfred Nestler and Paul Pletka. A collection of Japanese art\u2014mostly ukiyo-e prints but also drawings, bugaku masks and woodcuts by Shiko Munakata\u2014was bequeathed to the ACF in 2015 by local legend Bill Robinson, the founder and tireless promoter of Colorado Mesa University's theater department.Mawdsley, Melinda \"Robinson feted for 90th Birthday\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel January 13, 2013 == Programs and partnerships == The Art Center offers a variety of classes, workshops and exhibits for individuals of all ages, skill levels and abilities.

In 2015, 1,521 children attended summer Art Camps held over the course of 18 weeks. Spring Art Week is a program designed to expose Mesa County elementary schoolchildren to a variety of art forms and materials through demonstrations by area artists. The center coordinates the program, in which artists explain and demonstrate their particular disciplines to small tour groups. This intimate forum allows children to ask questions and become familiar with various art forms.. Teachers distribute packets of art projects that can easily be done when the children return to the classroom. In 2015, 881 students visited the Art Center for Spring Art Week. The Altrusa Art Fair has been organized by the Altrusa International service group for 50 years now. The middle- and high-school exhibits are meant to promote fresh, young talent that might otherwise go unnoticed.

Many of the students are repeat attendees. About 30 percent of the students are identified as mentally and/or physically challenged. === Community events === The Art Center regularly serves as a community space for public events and private occasions like weddings or memorial celebrations. The first bar mitzvah in Grand Junction occurred at the Art Center.\"Jews Celebrate a Boy's Special Day\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel May 23, 1987 === Exhibits === The Art Center hosts an average of 26 exhibits each year, some of which are annual events while the rest are signature events.

The Guild also raises funds for the center with a series of summer concerts, and it provides volunteers, food and refreshments at exhibition openings. === Clubs === The Art Center provides exhibition space for local and regional artist clubs. For some, it also serves as their regular meeting venue. Notable recurring shows include the National Juried Western Colorado Watercolor Society Exhibit sponsored by the Western Colorado Watercolor Society and the annual Brush and Palette Club exhibition.Brush & Palette Club celebrates anniversary Glenwood Springs Post Independent October 4, 2007 Other groups with a prominent presence at the Art Center include the Colorado West Quilters' Guild,\"Quilt exhibit tackles sensitive theme - 'Atrocities: Women and War' Glenwood Springs Post Independent June 2, 2011 the Pastel Society, the Western Colorado Bonsai Society, the Grand Junction-based Rocky Mountain Collage Society, and The Outsiders, which is a plein air painting group formed by a group of women who met while taking classes at the Art Center more than 25 years ago. == Facilities == The current 14,000-square-foot facility includes: * four exhibition galleries, * a working studio/gallery space, * 3,000 square feet of classroom studio space, * a gift shop, * two enclosed courtyards, one featuring a Japanese garden and the other a sculpture garden, * climate- controlled art collection storage, and * administrative offices. == Operations == The workforce of The Art Center has evolved substantially from its origin as a purely volunteer-staffed nonprofit. Currently, the programs and displays are made possible by six paid, full-time staffers, two part-timers and a rotating group of teachers, and 300-plus volunteers. Funding comes in a variety of ways, too: Tuition (31%), membership (14%), donations and sponsorships (35%), art sales and commission (6%), facility rental (5%), admission (2%), and investments/other (7%). In addition to funding the roughly $400,000 operating budget, there's always a need for more capital fundraising opportunities in hopes of making upgrades to the aging facility. The Art Center has three significant fundraising events each year. The annual Fine Arts Auction is the Art Center's biggest fund-raising event. Admissions and sales support education and exhibition programs. All art sold in the auction is original.\"A few moments with Mike Hurshman, Art Center Board Member\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel February 6, 2004 pg.

After a lull during the Depression and World War II, the group renewed its activities under a new name, the Fine Arts Association.\"Depression, War Big Obstacles, but Center for Arts 'Healthy'\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel July 4, 1976 Pg. 60 In February 1953, the group became incorporated as the Mesa County Art Center.\"Cultural Confidential: The Art Center celebrates 55 years\" Glenwood Springs Post Independent September 4, 2008 In 1957, the organization was granted 501(c)(3) status, and in January 1968, members voted to change the name to the Western Colorado Center for the Arts. Credit for transforming the small, 1940s art club into a formal nonprofit with an art center for the community is largely given to 21 individuals. In 1947, Fred Mantey, a local philanthropist, offered to donate one acre and $1,000 for the purpose of creating an art center in Grand Junction.Interview with Robbie Breaux, President of the Board of Trustees, Western Colorado Center for the Arts June 2016 Alfred Nestler, an interior decorator, prominent artist of the region, and Mantey's son-in-law, promoted the idea and enlisted other artists to help organize the effort.\"Arts Center Program will Honor Founders\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel November 2, 1986 After much behind-the-scenes work, Mantey's donation became official in 1953. Other people who devoted significant resources and time to the founding of the Art Center and served on its board included: * E.L. Bacon- president of US Bank at the time * Josephine Biggs * Verona Burkhard - a nationally known artist and teacher, she designed and created the copper doors in the first building constructed to house the Art Center * Bryce Carpenter * Helen Crosbie- a nationally known sculptor * Dr. Stanley Crosbie * Lucy Ela- a former member of the Beaux Art Club, she wrote the Art Center's constitution and bylaws. * Dr. Kenneth Graves- one of the founders of Community Hospital * Glenn Hopper- owner of Intermountain Printing at the time * Jessie Jones * Helen Martin * Ruth G. Moss * Conway Nowlan * Clarence Prinster- one of four brothers who developed the City Market grocery store chain, he pursued oil painting as a hobby. * Alvie Redden- the first full-time art instructor at Colorado Mesa University (formerly Mesa State College) * George Unkless * Gretl Waldapfel * Dr. Richard Waldapfel * Sterling Smith While raising funds for a building of their own, the board and volunteers presented art programs at various locations in Grand Junction. They could be found promoting the arts at such places as elementary schools and city hall. They also circulated art masterpiece reproductions in Mesa County Valley School District 51 schools,\"The Art Center Celebrates 50 Years\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel special feature July 13, 2003 pg. O&A; 2 and operated a rental gallery where an average of 500 paintings per month were loaned to businesses and private residences.Original scrapbooks of founder Ruth Moss, Art Center historical archives, accessed June 2016. By 1940, the group had purchased six paintings for the Art Center's permanent collection. These art works were stored for safe keeping at the central branch of the Mesa County Public Library and at Mesa Junior College (which later became Colorado Mesa University).McNab, Cheryl \"Western Colorado Center for the Arts: Employee Handbook\" 2012 The fundraising campaign included artists' balls, exhibits, sidewalk art sales, musical shows and rummage sales. One effort petitioned school children to buy a brick' for the new building for 25 cents. According to the Art Center, every student attending local schools bought a brick. Art clubs in the area, including the Brush and Palette Club, Paint for Pleasure, the Wednesday Music Club, and the original Colorado chapter of the American Artists Professional League, supported fundraising efforts with projects of their own. In 1957, with approval from Mantey's widow, the board of trustees decided to sell the land given to the organization by Fred Mantey, deeming it too far out of town to serve as a good location for a community arts center. In May 1960, the organization bought and remodeled a two-story frame house at 1745 N. Seventh Street in Grand Junction. The building was meant to serve as a temporary location until an ideal structure could be built. The Mesa County Art Center facility opened its doors November 1960. The main floor of the house was used for exhibits and recitals. Painting classes were held upstairs, and ceramics classes were in the basement. The Art Center boasted 121 members. By 1965, the Art Center had outgrown the original house. A professional fundraising effort kicked off in October 1967, and the Art Center took over its own campaign several months later. With the generous help of area residents and businesses, a new building was erected just north of the two- story house.\"Business Biography\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel March 12, 1978 pg. 6 The facility included a kitchen, classrooms, and an octagonal room with walls designed for exhibits. This room also included a stage for music and dance performances and productions of a community theater group. The Art Center moved in April, 1970. The Art Center also purchased additional land north of the new building to Orchard Avenue which now serves as the parking lot. The Art Center hired its first director in September 1978,\"Art Center's New Director to Take Post\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel October 11, 1978 pg. 34 and programs were expanded to include more classes and some major juried shows. In 1982, the Art Center received a $100,000 donation from the Grand Junction Lions Club. This money came with two conditions: Matching funds must be raised from the community and the Art Center must break ground on its second expansion before January 1983. The Art Center broke ground on the expansion just weeks before the deadline.\"Ground broken for Addition to Western Slope Art Center\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel December 18, 1982 pg. 26 This expansion turned a 7,800-square-foot facility into a 14,000-square- foot building.Dodworth, Allen \"Western Colorado Center for the Arts Expansion Proposal\" 1981 Art Center historical archives, accessed June 2016. New features included a large entrance lobby with an art shop, two courtyards, the North Gallery, storage areas, and a ceramics studio. Storage and dressing rooms were added to the theater area during remodeling of the existing building. Both the house and the new building were owned free and clear. The Art Center planned to reopen with an exhibition from the Smithsonian Institution featuring works of 20th century artists, including Pablo Picasso.\"Going Up: Expanding Fine Arts Center Awaiting Summer Opening\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel May 15, 1983 pg. 15 Unfortunately, the $750,000 expansion coincided with the collapse of the oil shale industry. Grand Junction's economy took an abrupt downturn and the population declined as major oil shale extraction operations and other energy-related businesses laid off thousands of workers. The Arts Center's funding drive to pay for the expansion came up short.\"Art Center Climbs Back into the Black\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel August 6, 1987 pg. 1B By 1985, the Art Center had 760 members. However, new membership was down, and existing members were renewing at reduced levels. Simultaneously, the operating costs of the Art Center had increased, and both investment and program revenue were down. The Art Center turned its focus to local artists and exhibits, and cut its professional organization memberships.\"Interest in Arts Center is Up but Revenues are Down\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel May 12, 1985 pg. 4C. The director resigned, saying the Art Center could no longer afford his position.\"Art Center Director Resigns: Dwindling Funds Force Board of Trustees to Consider Changes\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel June 18, 1985 pg. 1B In 1986, 10 members of the Board of Trustees put their own money into sponsoring the biggest juried art show undertaken in Grand Junction to date. The show, titled ART-USA, was organized in less than four months. A sum of $10,000 would be divided among the top four artists. The unusually high cash prizes were designed to attract a large number of entries, and announcements were sent to art schools and institutions nationwide. The board of trustees anticipated thousands of entrants, followed by thousands of visitors to the 6-week exhibition.\"Backers Plan Huge Show: ART USA aims for a $10,000 purse\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel February 23, 1986 pgs. 1C, 8C. ART-USA was the first time the Art Center charged admission to an exhibit.\"Newest Arts Center Director Looks to the Future, not Past\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel October 12, 1986 pg. 10C Following the success of ART- USA, the Art Center sought to reengage the community with events like Mardi Gras celebrations or Elizabethan dinner-and-theater events. Emphasis was given to making art fun and accessible for families with the aim of dispelling the perception that the Art Center was an elite club purely for intellectuals. In 1986, the Art Center Foundation was established. This endowment is a separate, supporting entity to the Art Center. At present, the ACF owns most of the permanent art collection housed at the Art Center. On the heels of a second successful ART-USA exhibit that saw 1,600 entries from across the US and abroad,\"ART USA 'Running Away' with Success\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel August 23, 1987 pg. 8C the Art Center repaid its debts. In the spring of 1989, Dr. Arch Gould approached the Art Center with an idea: He would donate $100,000 worth of Navajo rugs to the ACF permanent collection and $100,000 to expand the Art Center facility if the community could raise $100,000 for the long-term maintenance of the collection. A collector from the eastern United States promised six additional rugs worth an estimated $75,000.\"Funding Success: Navajo Rug Challenge Nearly Met\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel September 8, 1990 The new space, dubbed the Gould Gallery, was dedicated in January 1991. Beginning in the 1990s, the Art Center found itself struggling once again with space restrictions, high use and limited finances. The Art Center tried twice to negotiate a loan from the city of Grand Junction, but was unsuccessful.\"Arts Center Finds Unlikely City Ally\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel May 28, 1992 pg. 1A In 1992, an emergency membership drive was staged, and the board reluctantly agreed to charge a general admission fee to the Art Center as a \"last resort.\"\"Arts Center Seeking Funds to Remain Open\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel June 23, 1992 pg. 1B The generosity of local patrons and shrewd management kept the doors to the Art Center open through the tight local economy of the 1990s, when the area was once again experiencing the detrimental effects of a downturn in the energy industry. The Art Center has tried twice to relocate for the sake of space.

Recent renovations totaling $80,000 have adapted the building to meet the requirements of the American With Disabilities Act.
