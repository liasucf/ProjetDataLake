    "text": "The 2020\u201321 UEFA Europa League is the 50th season of Europe's secondary club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 12th season since it was renamed from the UEFA Cup to the UEFA Europa League. The final will be played at the Stadion Energa Gda\u0144sk in Gda\u0144sk, Poland. The stadium was originally appointed to host the 2020 UEFA Europa League Final, but this was moved due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The winners of the 2020\u201321 UEFA Europa League will automatically qualify for the 2021\u201322 UEFA Champions League group stage and also earn the right to play against the winners of the 2020\u201321 UEFA Champions League in the 2021 UEFA Super Cup. As the title holders of the Europa League, Sevilla qualified for the 2020\u201321 UEFA Champions League, although they had already qualified before the final through their league performance. They will be unable to defend their title unless they finish third in their Champions League group and are transferred to the Europa League. ==Association team allocation== A total of 213 teams from all 55 UEFA member associations participate in the 2020\u201321 UEFA Europa League. The association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients is used to determine the number of participating teams for each association: *Associations 1\u201350 (except Liechtenstein) each have three teams qualify. *Associations 51\u201355 each have two teams qualify (starting from this season, with association 51 losing one spot and association 55 gaining one spot). *Liechtenstein have one team qualify (Liechtenstein organises only a domestic cup and no domestic league). *Moreover, 55 teams eliminated from the 2020\u201321 UEFA Champions League are transferred to the Europa League (default number is 57, but 2 fewer teams compete in the 2020\u201321 UEFA Champions League). ===Association ranking=== For the 2020\u201321 UEFA Europa League, the associations are allocated places according to their 2019 UEFA country coefficients, which takes into account their performance in European competitions from 2014\u201315 to 2018\u201319. Apart from the allocation based on the country coefficients, associations may have additional teams participating in the Champions League, as noted below: * \u2013 Additional teams transferred from

title holders, Sevilla, which were guaranteed berths in the Champions League group stage, already qualified for the Champions League group stage via their domestic leagues, meaning there were fewer teams transferred from the Champions League due to changes in the Champions League access list. However, as a result of schedule delays to both the 2019\u201320 and 2020\u201321 European seasons due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020\u201321 European season started before the conclusion of the 2019\u201320 European season. Therefore, the changes to the access list that should be made based on the Champions League and Europa League title holders could not be certain until matches of the earlier qualifying rounds had been played and/or their draws had been made. UEFA used \"adaptive re-balancing\" to change the access list once the berths for the Champions League and Europa League title holders were determined, and rounds which had already been drawn or played by the time the title holders were determined would not be impacted (Regulations Article 3.07) The following changes were made: *Since the Champions League title holder berth in the 2020\u201321 UEFA Champions League group stage was vacated, only five losers of the Champions League third qualifying round (Champions Path), instead of the original six, were transferred to the Europa League play-off round (Champions Path). In this case, two losers of Champions League second qualifying round (Champions Path), determined by draw, received a bye to the play-off round (Champions Path) instead of entering the third qualifying round (Champions Path). *At the time when the draws for the preliminary round and first qualifying round were held on 9 and 10 August 2020, it was not certain whether the Europa League title holder berth in the 2020\u201321 UEFA Champions League group stage would be vacated as four of the quarter-finalists of the 2019\u201320 UEFA Europa League, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Bayer Leverkusen, Copenhagen and Basel, did not qualify for the 2020\u201321 UEFA Champions League group stage via their domestic leagues. Therefore, these draws proceeded as normal per the default access list, and the matches drawn, which were played on 18\u201321 and 25\u201327 August 2020, were not changed even though after the quarter-finals of the 2019\u201320 UEFA Europa League, which were played on 10\u201311 August 2020, it was confirmed all four semi-finalists, Sevilla, Manchester United, Inter Milan and Shakhtar Donetsk, already qualified for the 2020\u201321 UEFA Champions League group stage via their domestic leagues, meaning the Europa League title holder berth would be vacated. As a result, only three losers of the Champions League third qualifying round (League Path), instead of the original four, were transferred to the Europa League group stage, and \"adaptive re-balancing\" started from the second qualifying round (Main Path), whose draw was held on 31 August 2020, and the following changes to the access list were made: **The cup winners of association 13 (Czech Republic), Sparta Prague, entered the group stage instead of the third qualifying round (Main Path). **The second-placed team of association 18 (Cyprus), Anorthosis (which qualified for the cup winner berth), and the cup winners of association 19 (Serbia), Vojvodina, entered the third qualifying round (Main Path) instead of the second qualifying round (Main Path). ====Redistribution rules==== A Europa League place is vacated when a team qualifies for both the Champions League and the Europa League, or qualifies for the Europa League by more than one method. When a place is vacated, it is redistributed within the national association by the following rules: *When the domestic cup winners (considered as the \"highest-placed\" qualifier within the national association with the latest starting round) also qualify for the Champions League, their Europa League place is vacated. As a result, the highest-placed team in the league which have not yet qualified for European competitions qualify for the Europa League, with the Europa League qualifiers which finish above them in the league moved up one \"place\". *When the domestic cup winners also qualify for the Europa League through league position, their place through the league position is vacated. As a result, the highest-placed team in the league which have not yet qualified for European competitions qualify for the Europa League, with the Europa League qualifiers which finish above them in the league moved up one \"place\" if possible. *For associations where a Europa League place is reserved for either the League Cup or end-of-season European competition play-offs winners, they always qualify for the Europa League as the \"lowest-placed\" qualifier. If the League Cup winners have already qualified for European competitions through other methods, this reserved Europa League place is taken by the highest-placed team in the league which have not yet qualified for European competitions. ===Teams=== In early April 2020, UEFA announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, the deadline for entering the tournament had been postponed until further notice. UEFA also sent a letter to all member associations that domestic leagues must be completed in full without ending prematurely in order to qualify for European competitions. After meeting with the 55 UEFA associations on 21 April 2020, UEFA strongly recommended them to finish domestic top league and cup competitions, although in some special cases where it is not possible, UEFA would develop guidelines concerning participation in its club competitions in case of a cancelled league or cup. After the UEFA Executive Committee meeting on 23 April 2020, UEFA announced that if a domestic competition is prematurely terminated for legitimate reasons in accordance with conditions related to public health or economic problems, the national associations concerned are required to select their participating teams for the 2020\u201321 UEFA club competitions based on sporting merit in the 2019\u201320 domestic competitions, and UEFA reserves the right to refuse their admission if UEFA deems the termination of the competitions not legitimate, or the selection procedure not objective, transparent and non-discriminatory, or the team is perceived by the public as qualifying unfairly. A suspended domestic competition may also be restarted with a different format from the original one in a manner which would still facilitate qualification on sporting merit. All leagues should communicate to UEFA by 25 May 2020 whether they intend to restart their competitions, but this deadline was later extended. On 17 June 2020, UEFA announced that associations must enter their teams by 3 August 2020. If a cup is abandoned or not completed by the UEFA registration deadline, the Europa League places are distributed by league positions only. The labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round: *CW: Cup winners *2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, etc.: League position of the previous season *LC: League Cup winners *RW: Regular season winners *PW: End- of-season Europa League play-offs winners *UCL: Transferred from the Champions League **GS: Third-placed teams from the group stage **CH/LP PO: Losers from the play-off round (Champions/League Path) **CH/LP Q3: Losers from the third qualifying round (Champions/League Path) **CH/LP Q2: Losers from the second qualifying round (Champions/League Path) **Q1: Losers from the first qualifying round **PR: Losers from the preliminary round (F: final; SF: semi- finals) *Abd-: League positions of abandoned season due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe as determined by the national association; all teams are subject to approval by UEFA as per the guidelines for entry to European competitions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic The second qualifying round, third qualifying round and play-off round are divided into Champions Path (CH) and Main Path (MP). {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Qualified teams for 2020\u201321 UEFA Europa League |- !colspan=2|Entry round !colspan=4|Teams |- !colspan=2 rowspan=2| |style=\"min-width:10em\"| |style=\"min-width:10em\"| |style=\"min- width:10em\"| |style=\"min-width:10em\"| |- | | | | |- !colspan=6| |- !colspan=2 rowspan=7| | Villarreal | Real Sociedad | Arsenal | Leicester City |- | Napoli | Roma | Bayer Leverkusen | 1899 Hoffenheim |- | Lille | Nice | CSKA Moscow | Braga |- | Antwerp | Zorya Luhansk | Sivasspor | Feyenoord |- | Wolfsberger AC | Sparta Prague | Slavia Prague | Omonia |- | Molde | Maccabi Tel Aviv | Gent | PAOK |- | Benfica | AZ | Rapid Wien | |- !colspan=6| |- !rowspan=2| !rowspan=2| | Dinamo Zagreb | Young Boys | Red Star Belgrade | Dynamo Brest |- | Qaraba\u011f | Ludogorets Razgrad | Tirana | |- !colspan=6| |- !rowspan=7| !rowspan=2| | Celtic | Legia Warsaw | CFR Cluj | Celje |- | Sheriff Tiraspol | Sarajevo | S\u016bduva | K\u00cd |- !rowspan=4| | Rostov | Sporting CP | Charleroi | Desna Chernihiv |- | Alanyaspor | PSV Eindhoven | LASK | AEK Athens |- | Rijeka | S\u00f8nderjyskE | St. Gallen | Anorthosis |- | Vojvodina | Be\u015fikta\u015f | Viktoria Plze\u0148 | Lokomotiva |- !colspan=6| |- !rowspan=12| !rowspan=5| | Djurg\u00e5rdens IF | Astana | Slovan Bratislava | Sileks |- | Dundalk | KuPS | KR | Riga |- | Fola Esch | Ararat-Armenia | Floriana | Flora |- | Dinamo Tbilisi | Connah's Quay Nomads | Budu\u0107nost Podgorica | Europa |- | Linfield | Drita | Inter Club d'Escaldes | Tre Fiori |- !rowspan=7| | Granada | Tottenham Hotspur | Milan | VfL Wolfsburg |- | Reims | Dynamo Moscow | Rio Ave | Standard Li\u00e8ge |- | Kolos Kovalivka | Galatasaray | Willem II | Hartberg |- | Jablonec | Slovan Liberec | Aris | OFI |- | Osijek | Hajduk Split | Copenhagen | Basel |- | Rangers | BATE Borisov | IFK G\u00f6teborg | Viking |- | Kaisar |colspan=3| |- !colspan=6| |- !colspan=2 rowspan=22| | AGF | Servette | APOEL | Apollon Limassol |- | Partizan | TSC Ba\u010dka Topola | Motherwell | Aberdeen |- | Shakhtyor Soligorsk | Dinamo Minsk | Malm\u00f6 FF | Hammarby IF |- | Bod\u00f8/Glimt | Rosenborg | Kairat | Ordabasy |- | Cracovia | Lech Pozna\u0144 | Piast Gliwice | Neft\u00e7i |- | Ke\u015fla | Sumgayit | Hapoel Be'er Sheva | Maccabi Haifa |- | Beitar Jerusalem | Lokomotiv Plovdiv | CSKA Sofia | Slavia Sofia |- | FCSB | Universitatea Craiova | Boto\u0219ani | \u017dilina |- | DAC Dunajsk\u00e1 Streda | Ru\u017eomberok | Mura | Maribor |- | Olimpija | Vaduz | Honv\u00e9d | Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1r |- | Pusk\u00e1s Akad\u00e9mia | Shk\u00ebndija | Renova | Shkupi |- | Petrocub H\u00eence\u0219ti | Sf\u00e2ntul Gheorghe | Dinamo-Auto | Teuta |- | Kuk\u00ebsi | La\u00e7i | Shamrock Rovers | Bohemians |- | Derry City | Ilves | Inter Turku | Honka |- | V\u00edkingur Reykjav\u00edk | Brei\u00f0ablik | FH | \u017deljezni\u010dar |- | Zrinjski Mostar | Borac Banja Luka | \u017dalgiris | Riteriai |- | Kauno \u017dalgiris | RFS | Ventspils | Valmiera |- | Progr\u00e8s Niederkorn | Differdange 03 | Union Titus P\u00e9tange | Noah |- | Alashkert | Shirak | Valletta | Hibernians |- | Sirens | FCI Levadia | N\u00f5mme Kalju | Paide Linnameeskond |- | Saburtalo Tbilisi | Dinamo Batumi | Locomotive Tbilisi | The New Saints |- | Bala Town | Sutjeska Nik\u0161i\u0107 |colspan=2| |- !colspan=6| |- !colspan=2 rowspan=4| | Barry Town United | Iskra Danilovgrad | Zeta | HB T\u00f3rshavn |- | B36 T\u00f3rshavn | NS\u00cd Runav\u00edk | St Joseph's | Lincoln Red Imps |- | Glentoran | Coleraine | Prishtina | Gjilani |- | FC Santa Coloma | Engordany | Tre Penne | La Fiorita |} Notes ==Schedule== The schedule of the competition is as follows (all draws are held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland). The tournament would originally have started in June 2020, but had been delayed to August due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. The new schedule was announced by the UEFA Executive Committee on 17 June 2020. All qualifying matches, including the play-off round, were be played as single leg matches, hosted by one of the teams decided by draw. The group stage draw was originally to be held at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center in Athens, Greece, but UEFA announced on 9 September 2020 that it would be relocated to Nyon. Note: Matches may also be played on Tuesdays or Wednesdays instead of the regular Thursdays due to scheduling conflicts. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |+Schedule for 2020\u201321 UEFA Europa League |- !Phase !Round !Draw date !First leg !Second leg |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Qualifying |Preliminary round |9 August 2020 |colspan=\"2\"|20 August 2020 |- |First qualifying round |10 August 2020 |colspan=\"2\"|27 August 2020 |- |Second qualifying round |31 August 2020 |colspan=\"2\"|17 September 2020 |- |Third qualifying round |1 September 2020 |colspan=\"2\"|24 September 2020 |- |Play-off |Play-off round |18 September 2020 |colspan=\"2\"|1 October 2020 |- |rowspan=\"6\"|Group stage |Matchday 1 |rowspan=\"6\"|2 October 2020 |colspan=\"2\"|22 October 2020 |- |Matchday 2 |colspan=\"2\"|29 October 2020 |- |Matchday 3 |colspan=\"2\"|5 November 2020 |- |Matchday 4 |colspan=\"2\"|26 November 2020 |- |Matchday 5 |colspan=\"2\"|3 December 2020 |- |Matchday 6 |colspan=\"2\"|10 December 2020 |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Knockout phase |Round of 32 |14 December 2020 |18 February 2021 |25 February 2021 |- |Round of 16 |26 February 2021 |11 March 2021 |18 March 2021 |- |Quarter-finals |rowspan=\"3\"|19 March 2021 |8 April 2021 |15 April 2021 |- |Semi-finals |29 April 2021 |6 May 2021 |- |Final |colspan=\"2\"|26 May 2021 at Stadion Energa Gda\u0144sk, Gda\u0144sk |} The original schedule of the competition, as planned before the pandemic, was as follows (all draws held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, unless stated otherwise). {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ |- !Phase !Round !Draw date !First leg !Second leg |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Qualifying |Preliminary round |9 June 2020 |25 June 2020 |2 July 2020 |- |First qualifying round |16 June 2020 |9 July 2020 |16 July 2020 |- |Second qualifying round |17 June 2020 |23 July 2020 |30 July 2020 |- |Third qualifying round |20 July 2020 |6 August 2020 |13 August 2020 |- |Play-off |Play-off round |3 August 2020 |20 August 2020 |27 August 2020 |- |rowspan=\"6\"|Group stage |Matchday 1 |rowspan=\"6\"|28 August 2020 (Monaco) |colspan=\"2\"|17 September 2020 |- |Matchday 2 |colspan=\"2\"|1 October 2020 |- |Matchday 3 |colspan=\"2\"|22 October 2020 |- |Matchday 4 |colspan=\"2\"|5 November 2020 |- |Matchday 5 |colspan=\"2\"|26 November 2020 |- |Matchday 6 |colspan=\"2\"|10 December 2020 |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Knockout phase |Round of 32 |14 December 2020 |18 February 2021 |25 February 2021 |- |Round of 16 |26 February 2021 |11 March 2021 |18 March 2021 |- |Quarter-finals |rowspan=\"3\"|19 March 2021 |8 April 2021 |15 April 2021 |- |Semi-finals |29 April 2021 |6 May 2021 |- |Final |colspan=\"2\"|26 May 2021 at Estadio Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez-Pizju\u00e1n, Seville |} ==Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic== Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, the following special rules are applicable to the competition: *If there are travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic that prevent the away team from entering the home team's country or returning to their own country, the match may be played at a neutral country or the away team's country that allows the match to take place. *If a team refuses to play or is considered responsible for a match not taking place, they are considered to have forfeited the match. If both teams refuse to play or are considered responsible for a match not taking place, both teams are disqualified. *If a team has players and/or officials tested positive for SARS-2 coronavirus preventing them from playing the match before the deadline set by UEFA, they are considered to have forfeited the match. On 24 September 2020, UEFA announced that five substitutions would be permitted from the group stage onward, with a sixth allowed in extra time. However, each team is only given three opportunities to make substitutions during matches, with a fourth opportunity in extra time, excluding substitutions made at half-time, before the start of extra time and at half-time in extra time. Consequently, a maximum of twelve players can be listed on the substitute bench. All qualifying matches were played behind closed doors. Following the partial return of fans at the 2020 UEFA Super Cup, UEFA announced on 1 October 2020 that matches from the group stage onward could be played at 30% capacity if allowed by the local authorities. Video assistant referees will not be introduced for the group phase as planned (now to start in 2021\u201322), but will still be used in the knockout stage. ==Preliminary round== ==Qualifying rounds== ===First qualifying round=== ===Second qualifying round=== ===Third qualifying round=== ==Play-off round== ==Group stage== A total of 48 teams play in the group stage: 18 teams which enter in this stage, the 21 winners of the play-off round (eight from Champions Path, thirteen from Main Path), the six losers of the 2020\u201321 UEFA Champions League play-off round (four from Champions Path, two from League Path), and the three League Path losers of the 2020\u201321 UEFA Champions League third qualifying round. The draw for the group stage was held on 2 October 2020, 13:00 CEST. The 48 teams were drawn into twelve groups of four, with the restriction that teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots based on their 2020 UEFA club coefficients. In each group, teams play against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The group winners and runners-up advance to the round of 32, where they are joined by the eight third-placed teams of the 2020\u201321 UEFA Champions League group stage. Antwerp, Granada, Leicester City, Omonia and Sivasspor will make their debut appearances in the group stage. {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" |- !Tiebreakers |- | |} ===Group A=== ===Group B=== ===Group C=== ===Group D=== ===Group E=== ===Group F=== ===Group G=== ===Group H=== ===Group I=== ===Group J=== ===Group K=== ===Group L=== ==Knockout phase== ===Round of 32=== The draw for the round of 32 will be held on 14 December 2020.
