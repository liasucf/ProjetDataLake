She has a Bachelors in Materials Technology, University of Surrey (1985). Her first job after undergraduate study was in public relations, and she resigned when asked to promote asbestos despite its carcinogenic properties.http://www.materials.ac.uk/features/baillie.asp She returned to Surrey for a PhD in materials science and engineering (1991).http://www.sese.uwa.edu.au/research/researchstaff/caroline_baillie She has one son born in 2012.http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/201307265887/features/engineering-really- about-people ==Career== Her first lectureship in materials was in the Dept. of Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering, University of Sydney (1992-1996), where she also took a Masters in Higher Education, which helped to fuel her developing interest in student learning. She was then lecturer in Materials and education development at Imperial College London, then deputy director of the UK Centre for Materials Education at Liverpool University, Liverpool, United Kingdom (2000-2003). She then became the DuPont Canada Chair in Engineering Education at the Faculty of Applied Science at Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada. In 2009 she moved back to Australia, to the University of Western Australia in Perth where she held a Chair in Engineering Education and was Director of the Faculty Academy for the Scholarship of Education.http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/201003082238/features/encouraging- creativity-outlook In 2017 she became Professor of Praxis in the School of Engineering, University of San Diego.https://www.sandiego.edu/engineering/faculty-and- staff/biography.php?profile_id=2516http://www.sandiego.edu/engineering/about/detail.php?_focus=58278 ==Media== Baillie was the host of Building the Impossible, a four-part documentary commissioned by the BBC in which a team of experts undertook the challenge of building historical inventions to their original specification to see if they really worked. ==Awards and memberships== Caroline is co-founder and co-director, along with Eric Feinblatt, of Waste for Life, a network of scientists, engineers, academics, designers, and local communities working together to research, implement, and disseminate poverty-reducing solutions to specific environmental problems.Waste for Life Baillie is also a member of Critical Stage Company, which is \"committed to new writing, or tackling established pieces in a new way...\" Through Critical Stage and the Integrated Learning Centre at Queen's University, she put on several productions using student and members of the Kingston community that linked to the themes of engineering and society. She is also an associate editor of the Journal of Engineering Education. ==Publications== * Dowling, D, Hadgraft, R, Carew, A, McCarthy, T, Hargreaves, D, Baillie, C.A. 2016.
