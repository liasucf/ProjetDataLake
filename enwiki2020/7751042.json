Society for American Baseball Research, 55th Fighter Group Association The Canadian doctor and prisoner Doug Errey produced the prosthesis for Bert. Shepard had been gunned down east of Hamburg on his 34th mission as a P-38 fighter pilot; his life was saved by the doctor Lieutenant Ladislaus Loidl of the German Army. On February 21, 1945, Shepard was back in the United States and hoping to resume his pitching career. Prior to the war, he had pitched for minor leagues all across the country, including the Anaheim Aces in 1941. During spring training in 1945, he impressed Senators owner Clark Griffith enough to be hired as a pitching coach. He pitched exhibition games and batting practice as well as one regulation game, making him the first man with an artificial leg to pitch in a major league baseball game. On August 4, 1945 Shepard got the call to enter in the fourth inning of a home game in which the Senators were well behind the Boston Red Sox. It was game two of Washington's fourth consecutive doubleheader, with a fifth scheduled the next day as well. Shepard made headlines not only for being in the game itself, but also for his 5\u2153 innings of impressive relief, allowing only three hits and one run. He struck out the first batter he faced. The final score was Red Sox 15, Senators 4.Weintraub, Robert (2013) The Victory Season: The End of World War II and the Birth of Baseball's Golden Age. New York: Little Brown and Company, pages 137-138 The game of August 4, 1945 was notable for two other events as well. Shepard came in to relieve teammate Joe Cleary, whose surrender of seven runs on five hits and three walks in one-third of an inning in his only big-league appearance earned him the highest lifetime ERA \u2014 189.00 \u2014 of any pitcher in Major League Baseball history to have recorded at least one out. Also, outfielder Tom McBride tied a major league record with 6 runs batted in in the fourth inning, which was pitched by Cleary. In between games of a doubleheader on August 31, Shepard received the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal for his service in World War II. He later went on to be a player/manager in the minor leagues until 1954. He was a key participant in the National Amps baseball teams of former servicemen with amputations secondary to war injuries. After retiring from baseball, Shepard worked for IBM and Hughes Aircraft as a safety engineer. Shepard won the U.S. amputee golf championship in 1968 and 1971. Shepard died at age 87 in Highland, California. He was buried at Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California.Baseball's Greatest Sacrifice ==References== ==Further reading== *Dennis Snelling: A Glimpse of Fame, McFarland & Company, Jefferson N.C., 1993, pp. 115\u2013134 *Richard Tellis: Once Around The Bases, Triumph Books, Chicago, 1998, pp. 107\u2013120. ==External links== *Baseball in Wartime *BaseballLibrary \u2013 biography & photograph *BaseballLibrary \u2013 Once Around the Bases *Baseball Guru \u2013 Bert Shepard and the Missing Foot *New York Times obituary, June 19, 2008 Category:1920 births Category:2008 deaths Category:American amputees Category:American disabled sportspeople Category:Amputee sportspeople Category:Anaheim Aces players Category:Baseball players from Indiana Category:Bisbee Bees players Category:Burials at Riverside National Cemetery Category:Chattanooga Lookouts players Category:Decatur Commodores players Category:Duluth Dukes players Category:Hot Springs Bathers players Category:Jeanerette Blues players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Military personnel from Indiana Category:Modesto Reds players Category:Mount Airy Graniteers players Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Category:St. Augustine Saints players Category:Shot-down aviators Category:United States Army Air Forces officers Category:United States Army Air Forces pilots of World War II Category:Tampa Smokers players Category:Washington Senators (1901\u20131960) coaches Category:Washington Senators (1901\u20131960) players Category:Williston Oilers players Category:Wisconsin Rapids White Sox players Category:World War II prisoners of war held by Germany Category:Disabled baseball players ",
