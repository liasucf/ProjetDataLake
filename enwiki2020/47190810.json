    "text": "Human Longevity is a San Diego-based venture launched by Craig Venter and Peter Diamandis in 2013. Its goal is to build the world's most comprehensive database on human genotypes and phenotypes, and then subject it to machine learning so that it can help develop new ways to fight diseases associated with aging. The company received in investments in its Series A offering in summer 2014 and announced a further $220 million Series B investment offering in April 2016. It has made deals with drug companies Celgene and AstraZeneca to collaborate in its research. While it is conducting research, the company is offering a wellness service known as \"Health Nucleus,\" which offers customers a range of medical tests such as a full genome sequencing and tests for early indications of cancers, Alzheimer's and heart disease. This testing is meant to help people catch diseases earlier than otherwise possible and to identify risk factors for diseases later in life. At the start of 2017, the company hired Cynthia Collins from GE Healthcare, and Venter became Executive Chair. The company's chief operating officer, Mark Winham, left the company in mid-2017, and Collins and the company's chief medical officer, Brad Perkins, left in December. Venter stepped back into the CEO role, but announced in May 2018 that he was leaving the company to return to the J. Craig Venter Institute. Venter was sued for allegedly 'stealing trade secrets' at Human Longevity. The case has been dismissed. In 2018, according to The Wall Street Journal, \"the company's valuation has declined 80 percent, from a $1.6 billion peak to $310 million\" and \"the company\u2019s employee count has dropped from 300 workers in 2016 to 150\" in 2018. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Genetics organizations Category:Biotechnology companies of the United States Category:2013 establishments in California ",
