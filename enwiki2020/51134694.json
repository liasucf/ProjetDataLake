The song reached #31 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. The song was written by the band's lead singer Drew Womack, along with Tom Douglas. ==Content== The song is a ballad about the narrator missing his wife, who died in October 1989. In the chorus, he sings of the pain of her memory, saying that \"If I live in the past, there's no future / Looking forward to leaving October behind.\" ==Critical reception== A review in Billboard was positive, praising the \"heartache and resignation\" in Womack's voice, while calling the song itself \"extremely powerful\". Brian Wahlert of Country Standard Time considered the song a standout in his review of the album. ==Chart performance== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (1998) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |- |align=\"left\"|Canadian RPM Country Tracks |align=\"center\"|41 |} ==References== Category:1998 singles Category:1997 songs Category:Sons of the Desert (band) songs Category:Songs written by Tom Douglas (songwriter) Category:Song recordings produced by Doug Johnson (record producer) Category:Epic Records singles ",
