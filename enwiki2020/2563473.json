He made over 25 appearances in the Football League and the Conference National. ==Club career== Collins began his career at Ipswich and made his debut against Derby County 4\u20131 in May 2003. He collected a winners medal when Ipswich won the FA Youth Cup in April 2005 and made four league and cup appearances for the first-team in the 2005\u201306 season before joining Wycombe Wanderers on loan in January 2006. He made five Wycombe, scoring once, and then joined Stockport County on loan in March 2006, where he started two games before being recalled by Ipswich a month later. Collins was not offered a new contract at Ipswich at the end of the 2005\u201306 season and joined Cambridge United in January 2007 for one month on a non-contract basis. He started three games for Cambridge and agreed a contract until the end of the 2006\u201307 season with manager Jimmy Quinn saying, \"He's a fantastic addition to the team...\" In March 2007, he appeared with his brother, Jordan Collins in Cambridge's club-record 7\u20130 win over Weymouth, the first pair of siblings to appear for the club since November 1995. At the end of the season, he retired from the game due to injury but later joined Chelmsford City F.C. in August 2007. Assistant-manager Glenn Pennyfather said of him, \"Aidan is a fantastic signing. He is young, strong, good in the air in both boxes and reads the game well with excellent distribution.\" ==Personal life== Collins has graduated from Goldsmiths University where he completed an Undergraduate History Degree and runs a website with his brother called The Pro Lounge which combines articles, interviews and podcasts with current and former professional footballers. http://www.theprolounge.com ==Career statistics== :Source: {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\" |+Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|FA Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=5|Ipswich Town |2002\u201303 |First Division |1||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0 |- |2003\u201304 |First Division |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2004\u201305 |Championship |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2005\u201306 |Championship |3||0||0||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||4||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !4!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!5!!0 |- |Wycombe Wanderers (loan) |2005\u201306 |League Two |5||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||5||1 |- |Stockport County (loan) |2005\u201306 |League Two |3||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||3||0 |- |Cambridge United |2006\u201307 |Conference National |11||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||11||0 |- !colspan=3|Career total !23!!1!!0!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!24!!1 |} ==Honours== ;Ipswich Town *FA Youth Cup: 2004\u201305 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:English footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Ipswich Town F.C. players Category:Wycombe Wanderers F.C. players Category:Stockport County F.C. players Category:Cambridge United F.C. players Category:Chelmsford City F.C. players Category:Maldon & Tiptree F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:National League (English football) players ",
