    "text": "Janice Maurine Pennington (born July 8, 1942) is an American former model and was one of the original \"Barker's Beauties\" models on The Price Is Right, serving as the show's longest-running model, from the show's premiere in 1972 to 2000. She was also Playboy magazine's Playmate of the Month for the May 1971 issue. She is the older sister of fellow model Ann Pennington. Pennington is also the co-founder of the Hollywood Film Festival. == Personal life == Pennington was born in Seattle, Washington. She has been married three times. Her first marriage was to Glenn Jacobson. Her second husband was German mountain climber Friedrich \"Fritz\" Stammberger, who disappeared in Afghanistan in 1975 while mountain climbing. After years of searching, she speculated that Fritz was actually helping the CIA establish mountain bases along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, and had died during a battle with USSR forces. This has never been proven. In 1984, she married writer Carlos de Abreu, a native of Mozambique. == The Price Is Right == For 29 years, Pennington served as a model on The Price Is Right, handing the microphone to Bob Barker at the start of more than 5,000 shows. She also handed off to Dennis James and Tom Kennedy while the show was in syndication in 1972\u201377 and 1985\u201386, respectively. In June 1988, a camera hit Pennington and she fell off the stage. She was unconscious and was taken to a hospital; taping of the episode resumed after 45 minutes. Pennington's resulting surgery left her with scars and one shoulder shorter than the other, so she could no longer wear swimsuits on the show. A substitute model filled in for her briefly during that time. When Pearson Television took over the show on October 19, 2000, Pennington's employment ended the following year in 2001 following taping of the December 13, 2000 episode. She signed a confidential settlement agreement. == See also == * List of people in Playboy 1970\u20131979 == References == == External links == * * Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:Game show models Category:1970s Playboy Playmates Category:People from Seattle ",
