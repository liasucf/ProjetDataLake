    "text": "Tattletail is a survival horror game created by Waygetter Electronics. The player must care for their virtual pet toy, Baby Talking Tattletail, while avoiding the pursuit of its recalled predecessor, Mama Tattletail (commonly referred to as \"Mama\"). The game was released on Steam on December 28, 2016. Sometime after the game's full release, 2 updates were released, one adding multiple endings and the other adding an expansion campaign that takes place after the main game's campaign. During the expansion there is a mysterious person giving the player notes referencing that they failed to fix their memories. == Gameplay == For the five nights leading up to Christmas, the player must tend to their Baby Talking Tattletail toy by feeding it, grooming it, and allowing it to charge while completing a set of objectives each night. While the Baby Talking Tattletail is not a threat, it is prone to generating a lot of sound when its needs are not met, alerting Mama Tattletail of their location. While completing a set task, the player must avoid Mama by staying quiet when she is near. Failure to do so or going too close will result in Mama attacking the player in a jumpscare. Players acquire a shake flashlight to navigate in the darkness, but Mama Tattletail has the ability to kill their flashlight when they point it directly at her. Baby Talking Tattletail is also afraid of the dark and is quite vocal about it, creating a necessity to recharge the flashlight by shaking it quickly. However, shaking it generates sound, so the player must be careful about when and where to shake. Over the course of the game, a series of \"Gift Eggs\", presumably laid by Tattletail, are placed throughout the house. Collecting all of the eggs will result in the player achieving the \"good ending\" of the game. == Plot == The game takes place in 1998 over the course of 5 nights, beginning on December 20 and ending on Christmas Day. The player wakes up on Night 1 to open their Christmas present early. The present is the new fad toy, a purple Baby Talking Tattletail (based on a Furby). After playing with the toy briefly (which involves feeding and grooming it), the player puts it back into its box and goes back to bed. On Night 2, the player finds the same Tattletail in the tumble dryer, with no indication of how it got there. The player then charges it, wraps it back up into its box and goes back to bed. On Night 3, the player encounters the contents of an old nursery in the basement. In the corner sits the now-recalled Mama Tattletail, along with a cassette tape which can be played using the toy. The tape contains a snippet from a story in a read-along style - including prompts to \"turn the page\" - about how \"the children thought that Mama would never find them as long as she couldn't see them\" but Mama would find them nevertheless. The player returns upstairs to find that Tattletail has made a mess. Tattletail asks to be taken to \u201cMama\u201d. The player returns to the spot to find that Mama has disappeared. Mama Tattletail then starts to hunt down the player when they try to clean up after Tattletail. On Night 4, after a lengthy hide-and-seek session with another Tattletail, the player finds a VHS tape that shows several interchangeable camera feeds from what seems to be a Tattletail commercial (which is actually footage from the trailer). After some time, some of the camera feeds' names turn red, the lighting changes from blue to green and trash bags and obscured parts of inanimate or writhing human bodies appear. On Christmas Eve, Baby Talking Tattletail invites the player to the basement to join a \"party\" with a yellow and blue Baby Talking Tattletail, with two more that the player must fetch. After the player gets them, they must pick up their own Tattletail and get some supplies from upstairs. The player then finds out that the Talking Tattletails have made a pentagram out of the Christmas lights with the VHS tape in the middle, and have begun chanting in a seance. After rewinding the VHS tape, Mama appears and steals the candles and the player must find them in vases scattered around the basement while avoiding being attacked by Mama. Once the seance reaches its climax, the tape begins to levitate and the player must destroy it. The seance then ends and the player goes back to bed. ===Endings=== On Christmas Day, the ending of the game depends on whether the player has collected all 22 eggs laid out across the game: * Bad Ending: If the player fails to collect all 22 eggs, it takes longer to open the present, and Mama Tattletail\u2019s chase theme will begin to play. The gift box\u2019s bow comes off and the lid\u2019s position is slightly altered. The player then has to attempt to open it again, only to find the gift box is empty. Mama Tattletail then jump scares the player (implying that the ritual failed), ending the game and rolling the credits. This ending was the original canon ending before the release of \"The Gift\" Update. * Good Ending: If the player manages to collect all 22 eggs, their present is revealed to be the same Baby Talking Tattletail the player received when opening it 5 days early. Tattletail will then proceed to give the player a series of gifts - its birth tag and a golden flashlight. The player will then need to open the door of their mother's room and wake her up, triggering a white screen. The game ends with the Talking Tattletail saying \"Thank you\" for the player (considering the protagonist cannot yet speak), along with the player's mother yawning. This ending is considered canon in the Kaleidoscope DLC. * Joke Ending: If the player falls out of the map with Tattletail in their hands, Tattletail will begin to glitch out and start saying that the player broke \"it\" (more commonly known as the game). The game then ends and the credits roll. Although technically this ending was a glitch, it was awarded soon by the Waygetter Company with its own Tattletail dialogue. This ending will result in returning to the main menu with no progress. ===The Kaleidoscope DLC=== In the free Kaleidoscope DLC, the player awakens on Christmas Day to find their present, a purple Baby Talking Tattletail. However, it looks slightly different, talks in a boring monotonous voice and then glitches out. At the front door, the player finds a package and an anonymous letter claiming that Tattletail \"wasn't like this\" and \"this isn't how it happened at all\". The player then gradually remembers one night back and has to play through each night again in reverse order with the events and circumstances of the nights being similar, except Mama is now a friendly and caring character. Each night \"ends\" with a letter explaining that something went wrong, and the final letter explains that a place called the Kaleidoscope, where all memories are stored, is what's causing the changes. The player is then offered the choice to either go back to bed or enter the dangerous Kaleidoscope; going to the Kaleidoscope results in the \"good\" ending in which the player will retrieve their memories; going to bed results in the \"bad\" ending in which Tattletail will stay boring forever. In the Kaleidoscope, the environment looks like a glitched, warped version of the house lit in a bluish tint. The player eventually finds a VHS tape with a letter saying that it must be played to restore the player's memories; it contains a slightly different version of the Tattletail TV advert with 2 glitches. Once the tape is played, night one is repeated, with Tattletail restored to its cheery self; and Mama restored to its aggressive self. As the player is about to wrap Tattletail back up, it tells a joke, but is interrupted by Mama and the player is transported back to the Kaleidoscope. The player must then traverse back to the entrance of the Kaleidoscope without being killed by Mama. After escaping, the player wakes up on Christmas Day again and opens the gift. Once it's open, Tattletail gives the player a present with a final letter that praises the player and tells the player to say Hi to Tattletail for them. Tattletail then tells another joke to the player by telling him \"me love you!\", ending the game. == Development == The game was published under the name of the in-universe fictional toy company named Waygetter Electronics. In reality, the team is led by game designer Ben Esposito, and consists of character designer/co-developer Geneva Hodgson along with lead programmer Tom Astle. Cartoonist Ryann Shannon also stars as the voice of Talking Tattletail. == Reception == The game has received criticism for its resemblance to the Five Nights at Freddy's series for featuring similar elements, including its visual aesthetic, five-day time limit, and animatronic-based antagonists. GameSpew's Chris Mc praised its more structured gameplay, as well as its reproduction of nineties childhood fears. The game has also received very positive reviews on Steam. == In popular culture == Tattletail made appearances on three episodes in the Annoying Orange YouTube series for \u201cShocktober 2017.\u201d Following the Let\u2019s Play videos of the game on the Annoying Orange Gaming channel, Tattletail first made his debut on the episode, \u201cAsk Orange #35: Shocktober Surprise!\u201d when a fan made a comment about Pear looking like a Tattletail. The second appearance was made in the episode \u201cAnnoying Orange vs. Tattletail\u201d when Orange meets Tattletail who both disrupt and annoy an egg during quiet time in the kitchen from the game. Mama Tattletail makes her first appearance in the series as she appears with the same dialogue from the game, and ends up killing Egg as the scene cuts to black ending with Mama Tattletail saying, \u201cI\u2019ll always love you.\u201d Tattletail made a brief appearance in the episode \u201cTrick or Treat on Horror Street\u201d as Orange and the gang go trick-or-treating on \u201cHorror Street,\u201d Tattletail appeared as Halloween treats each wrapped and placed in a bowl at the house from the game where Mama Tattletail jump scares Orange, Pear, and Little Apple (erroneously called Midget Apple), and captures Pears as she shouts \u201cDon\u2019t leave me!\u201d Mama is later joined by Freddy Fazbear, Ink Bendy from Bendy and the Ink Machine, and Mr. Peterson from Hello Neighbor to jump scare Little Apple, who all revealed to be Orange, Pear, Grapefruit, and Marshmallow teaching him to lay off the horror video games he had been playing. == References == == External links == * Category:Windows games Category:MacOS games Category:Horror video games Category:Video games set in 1998 Category:2016 video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Unity (game engine) games ",
