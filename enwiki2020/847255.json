    "text": "Entrance to Heath Park Heath () is a district, community and coterminous electoral ward in the north of Cardiff, capital of Wales. It is a predominately affluent area with property prices being the third highest in the city. The area is known for its traditional 1930's detached and semi- detached properties with large south facing gardens. Roads are tree lined and large greeneries with the notable attraction of Heath Park and the joining of the University Hospital of Wales. The population of the ward and community taken at the 2011 census was 12,629. ==Description== Heath was originally called the Great Heath and named as a result of the large park and woodland that it once contained. After the initial development of traditionally middle- classed semi-detached housing (1920s-1950s) and more recently the construction of the University Hospital of Wales on the site of the former Heath Wood (1960s), much of the greenery has been eradicated. It should be distinguished from the Little Heath () which lies to the south of the Great Heath, in the vicinity of Crwys Road. The 37 hectare Heath Park forms the remainder of this area of grass and woodland. It includes attractions and facilities such as the George V Playing Fields, tennis courts, a miniature steam railway and refreshment facilities. Birchgrove is a busy shopping area that is part of the ward of Heath. It is composed mostly of more affordably priced housing, mainly terraced, and has taken on an identity of its own. The area around the University Hospital of Wales has been known as Saints Corner, due to the number of streets in the area named after well known saints. ==The Welsh language== The number of Heath residents over three years old who speak Welsh increased from 1,378 in the 2001 UK Census to 1,422 in the 2011 UK Census. In percentage terms there was a slight decrease (from 12.1% to 11.7%). This was caused by a reduction in the number of speakers over the age of 65; the age groups 3\u201315 and 16\u201464 both showed increases.'Welsh Language Commissioner: 2011 Census results by Community . ==Transport== Heath Low Level station === Rail === The area is served by two railway stations.
