    "text": "Hermitian varieties are in a sense a generalisation of quadrics, and occur naturally in the theory of polarities. ==Definition== Let K be a field with an involutive automorphism \\theta. Let n be an integer \\geq 1 and V be an (n+1)-dimensional vector space over K. A Hermitian variety H in PG(V) is a set of points of which the representing vector lines consisting of isotropic points of a non-trivial Hermitian sesquilinear form on V. ==Representation== Let e_0,e_1,\\ldots,e_n be a basis of V. If a point p in the projective space has homogeneous coordinates (X_0,\\ldots,X_n) with respect to this basis, it is on the Hermitian variety if and only if : \\sum_{i,j = 0}^{n} a_{ij} X_{i} X_{j}^{\\theta} =0 where a_{i j}=a_{j i}^{\\theta} and not all a_{ij}=0 If one constructs the Hermitian matrix A with A_{i j}=a_{i j}, the equation can be written in a compact way : X^t A X^{\\theta}=0 where X= \\begin{bmatrix} X_0 \\\\\\ X_1 \\\\\\ \\vdots \\\\\\ X_n \\end{bmatrix}. ==Tangent spaces and singularity== Let p be a point on the Hermitian variety H. A line L through p is by definition tangent when it is contains only one point (p itself) of the variety or lies completely on the variety. One can prove that these lines form a subspace, either a hyperplane of the full space. In the latter case, the point is singular. Category:Algebraic varieties ",
