State of Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau Informational Bulletin 99-1, September 1999; p. 69 == Background == Kasik was born in Milwaukee on June 13, 1920, and attended Milwaukee Country Day School and Milwaukee University School. He served in the United States Army during World War II, in 1942 and 1943. He was serving as vice-president of English Woolen Mills when he was elected to the Assembly.Toepel, M.

The Wisconsin blue book, 1956 Madison: State of Wisconsin, 1956; p. 56 == Legislative service == In 1954, Kasik was nominated to the Assembly from the 19th Milwaukee County district, which included the Town of Milwaukee (but not the City of Milwaukee itself), Bayside, Fox Point, Glendale, Granville, River Hills, Shorewood, and Whitefish Bay. Prior to redistricting, most of the district had been represented by fellow Republican Arthur R. Godar.Toepel, M. G.; Kuehn, Hazel L., eds. The Wisconsin blue book, 1954 Madison: State of Wisconsin, 1954; p. 55 He was nominated with only a plurality of votes in the Republican primary (2982 votes, to 2679 for Ervin Schneeberg and 613 for Henry Gefke); but had less trouble in the general election, defeating Democrat Stanley Lieberman by 15,685 to 6778. He was assigned to the standing committees on insurance and banking, and on taxation; and to a special committee on Urban Development (which was studying issues of annexation of particular concern to his suburban district).Toepel, M.

G.; Kuehn, Hazel L., eds. The Wisconsin blue book, 1958 Madison: State of Wisconsin, 1958; pp. 631, 671 in which he carried the rest of the district, but lost by a hefty margin in Hendee's home village of Shorewood.Getter, Doyle K. \"Hendee Win Is Feature in a State Senate Race\" Milwaukee Journal September 12, 1956; p. 15, col. 1 Kasik was succeeded by fellow Republican Jerris Leonard. == After the Assembly == At a 1957 Milwaukee County Republican meeting, Kasik referred to the state's United States senators Alexander Wiley and Joe McCarthy (themselves both Republicans) as \"the senior [and] the junior windbags from Wisconsin\".\"Vote Against Chiding Ike; County GOP Acts\" Milwaukee Journal April 11, 1957; p. 28, col. 3 In 1964, Kasik (now living in Mequon and working as an insurance agent\"Kasik Will Run For Assembly\" Milwaukee Sentinel May 22, 1964; pt. 2, p. 1, col. 8) was one of three challengers to incumbent State Representative (and Assistant Majority Leader) J.
