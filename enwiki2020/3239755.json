    "text": "The Greek National Socialist Party (, Elliniko Ethniko Sosialistiko Komma) was a Nazi party founded in Greece in 1932 by George S. Mercouris, a former Cabinet minister. ==History== Established in Athens in December 1932, the National Socialist Party was one of the far right groups active in the country at the time, others including the National Union of Greece (\u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2), Iron Peace (\u03a3\u03b9\u03b4\u03b7\u03c1\u03ac \u0395\u03b9\u03c1\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7), Trident (\u03a4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1), and National Sovereign State (\u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf \u039a\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, led by Skilakakis). However, it was distinguished by being the most fiercely supportive of Adolf Hitler, seeking to copy the National Socialist German Workers Party in organizational and policy terms.Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism 1914-1945, London, Roultedge, 2001 ,p. 320 The party emerged after Mercouris, who had previously shown sympathy to Italian fascist trade unions, split from Panagis Tsaldaris and the Populist Party over the need for a coalition government.Philip Rees, 'MERCOURIS, George S.', Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, p. 262 Through contacts with Galeazzo Ciano, Mercouris secured funding for the new group from Italy, although this soon dried up as they were not convinced that the party was in any position to gain power. The party itself was largely geared towards Italian fascism, although Mercouris himself and some of his main followers were more drawn to the German model. Mercouris was sometimes used as a go-between by the collaborationist government during the German occupation. ==Political support== The Greek party, however did not serve the regime of Ioannis Metaxas, although given the monarchist stance of the party many of its followers were reconciled to the new government. During the Axis occupation of Greece the group was allowed to continue, although it had no real role in the largely military-based Greek government and faced competition from the other extremist movements.Payne, A History of Fascism, p. 427 It had hoped to gain influence but the Germans reasoned that given its chronic lack of popular support it was not expedient to offer the party any power.Mark Mazower, Inside Hitler's Greece,: The Experience of Occupation, 1941-44, Yale University Press, 2001, p. 87 ==References== Category:Greek collaborators with Nazi Germany Category:Defunct nationalist parties in Greece Category:Fascism in Greece Category:1930s in Greece Category:1940s in Greece Category:Political parties established in 1932 Category:Political parties disestablished in 1943 Category:1932 establishments in Greece Category:1943 disestablishments in Greece Category:Nazi parties Category:Collaboration with the Axis Powers Category:Monarchist parties in Greece Category:Far-right political parties in Greece ",
