It was established on 24 September 2012, after Prime Minister Karim Massimov resigned the post that he had held since January 2007 and was appointed as the Head of the Presidential Administration. President Nursultan Nazarbayev nominated Akhmetov to be the new PM who was unanimously approved by the Parliament. As a result of the Kazakh tenge's devaluation in March 2014, Akhmetov was dismissed by Nazarbayev who reappointed Massimov on 2 April 2014. Akhmetov remained in the Massimov's cabinet after being appointed as the Minister of Defense on 3 April 2014. == Composition == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Functions ! colspan=\"2\" |Holder !Start !End |- |Prime Minister |140x140px |Serik Akhmetov |24 September 2012 |2 April 2014 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |First Deputy Prime Minister |118x118px |Krymbek Kusherbayev |26 September 2012 |16 January 2013 |- |148x148px |Bakhytzhan Sagintayev |16 January 2013 |8 September 2016 |- |Deputy Prime Minister |134x134px |Asset Isskeshev |12 March 2010 |6 August 2014 |- |Deputy Prime Minister |130x130px |Yerbol Orynbayev |11 April 2011 |28 November 2013 |- |Deputy Prime Minister |118x118px |Krymbek Kusherbayev |20 January 2012 |26 September 2012 |- |Deputy Prime Minister |111x111px |Kairat Kelimbetov |20 January 2012 |1 October 2013 |- |Deputy Prime Minister |130x130px |Bakhyt Sultanov |6 November 2013 |11 November 2018 |- |Deputy Prime Minister |144x144px |Gulshara Abdykhalikova |28 November 2013 |11 November 2014 |- |Prime Minister's Office |135x135px |Erlan Qo\u015fanov |2 January 2012 |27 March 2017 |- |Ministry of Foreign Affairs |145x145px |Erlan Idrissov |28 September 2012 |28 December 2016 |- |Ministry of Defense |146x146px |Adilbek Zhaksybekov |24 June 2009 |2 April 2014 |- |Ministry of Emergency Situations |127x127px |Vladimir Bozhko |13 November 2007 |6 August 2014 |- |Ministry of Internal Affairs |131x131px |Kalmukhambet Kassymov |11 April 2011 |12 February 2019 |- |- |Ministry of Agriculture | |Asyljan Mamytbekov |11 April 2011 |6 May 2016 |- |Ministry of Justice |131x131px |Berik Imashev |20 January 2012 |13 September 2016 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Ministry of Education and Science |132x132px |Bakhytzhan Zhumagulov |22 September 2010 |2 September 2013 |- | |Aslan Sarinjipov |2 September 2013 |10 February 2016 |- |Ministry of Healthcare | |Salidat Qaiyrbekova |7 October 2010 |6 August 2014 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Population |144x144px |Gulshara Abdykhalikova |4 March 2009 |26 September 2012 |- | |Serik Abdenov |26 September 2012 |10 June 2013 |- |141x141px |Tamara Duysenova |27 June 2013 |6 August 2014 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Ministry of Transport and Communications |120x120px |Askar Zhumagaliyev |21 January 2012 |7 March 2014 |- |133x133px |Zhenis Kassymbek |7 March 2014 |6 August 2014 |- |Ministry of Industry and New Technologies |134x134px |Asset Issekeshev |12 March 2010 |6 August 2014 |- |Ministry of Economic Integration |110x110px |Zhanar Aitzhanova |16 April 2011 |11 May 2016 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Ministry of Culture and Information |134x134px |Darhan Mynbai |23 January 2012 |16 January 2013 |- |131x131px |Mukhtar Kul-Mukhammed |16 January 2013 |13 March 2014 |- |130x130px |Arystanbek Muhamediuly |13 March 2014 |6 August 2014 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Ministry of Finance | |Bolat Zhamishev |16 November 2007 |6 November 2013 |- |130x130px |Bakhyt Sultanov |6 November 2013 |11 November 2018 |- |Minister of Economic Development and Trade | rowspan=\"2\" |125x125px | rowspan=\"2\" |Erbolat Dosaev |25 September 2012 |16 January 2013 |- |Ministry of Economy and Budget Planning |16 January 2013 |6 August 2014 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Ministry of Oil and Gas | |Sauat Mynbayev |12 March 2010 |3 July 2013 |- | |Uzakbay Karabalin |3 July 2013 |4 August 2014 |} == References == Category:Cabinets of Kazakhstan Category:2012 in Kazakhstan Category:Cabinets established in 2012 Category:2012 establishments in Kazakhstan ",
