    "text": "The William Thompson Jr. House, at 10 W. 400 North in Beaver, Utah, was built around 1880 by Scottish-born local stonemason Thomas Frazer. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It was built as a one-story black rock cottage with two rooms, and a symmetric window-door-window front facade.. It has endwall chimneys. It displays three of Frazer's characteristic elements: use of ashlar stonework on the front facade, use of beaded white mortar joints, and use of a Greek Revival-style cornice. According to its Utah State Historical Society information form: > This home is significant because of its historic date, its nearly unaltered > appearance, its black rock construction materials and its builder. / Thomas > Frazer was a folk architect in pioneer Beaver who built scores and scores of > structures. All of the commercial and industrial ones have been razed and > many of the residential ones are gone too. Of all Frazer T s buildings, the > ones to survive in the largest quantity are the more elaborate houses. The > more modest residences, like this home under discussion, have often been > razed or \"modernized\". That is why this home is so interesting - it has > survived nearly unaltered. The additions, which are also of a historic date, > extend backwards from the rear of the house, leaving the original two room > rock cottage with unimpared architectural integrity. Even the interior, with > its high ceilings and hard grained woodwork, has not been altered. / It is > important to find an example of Frazer's more modest residential > architecture because it is also illustrative of his early architecture. He > frequently built two room rock cottages, with medium-pitched roofs and Greek > Revival style cornices. These cottages also had the ashlor stonework and the > white mortar joints, but few of them are still extant. Thus the Thompson > house is of further significance because it is very similar - if not a > duplicate - of many of Frazer's early homes. With The property includes a small wood frame building, probably built around 1890, which was a saloon in downtown Beaver. It was moved to this property before 1912 by William Thompson, Jr. The property also has a root cellar, with a dirt roof, that could appear to be historical, but the owner in 1979 said he had built that recently. ==See also== *William Thompson House (Beaver, Utah), also NRHP-listed ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Beaver County, Utah Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1880 ",
