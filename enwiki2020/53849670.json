In a rare coincidence, none of the four players had ever previously appeared in the men's doubles finals of a Grand Slam tournament prior to the event. Feliciano L\u00f3pez and Marc L\u00f3pez were the defending champions, but lost to Julio Peralta and Horacio Zeballos in the first round. Henri Kontinen retained the ATP no. 1 doubles ranking at the end of tournament despite he lost in the first round after fellow contenders Nicolas Mahut and Marcelo Melo lost in the first and second rounds, respectively. ==Seeds== ==Draw== ===Finals=== ===Top half=== ====Section 1==== ====Section 2==== ===Bottom half=== ====Section 3==== ====Section 4==== ==References== ==External links== *2017 French Open \u2013 Men's draws and results at the International Tennis Federation Men's Doubles Category:French Open by year \u2013 Men's Doubles French Open - Men's Doubles ",
