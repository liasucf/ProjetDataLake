Colt's Industrial Trust Company, the Rhode Island Investment Company, the Rhode Island Electric Protective Company, the Old Colony Cooperative Bank, the Roger Williams Savings Fund and Loan Association, and the Boston Investment Company.

They had two children. Barker died suddenly on March 17, 1901, at his home in Providence while getting ready for church. The cause was apparently heart failure. He was buried at Swan Point Cemetery. ==City council== Barker served seven years on the city council, serving from 1873 to 1880. As a city councilman, Barker was a strong supporter of Mayor Doyle's introduction of modern infrastructure systems, needed as Providence grew into a modern city. These improvements included waterworks and a sewage system, modern schools, and improvements in municipal services. ==Mayor== As mayor, Barker called for city funding of the public library, which previously had been privately funded. He improved the sewage system and improved the railroad terminal. ==Notes== :a.Some sources give an incorrect year for Barker's death. His obituary was published in the Providence Daily Journal on 18 March 1901, confirming the 17 March 1901 date, which is consistent with his tombstone. == References == ==External links== * Henry Rodman Barker at Providence City website * Category:1841 births Category:Mayors of Providence, Rhode Island Category:American bankers Category:Burials at Swan Point Cemetery Category:American Freemasons Category:19th-century American Episcopalians Category:1901 deaths Category:Providence City Council members ",
