She lives and writes in Houston. == Early life and education == Moshiri grew up in a literary family. Her uncle, Fereydoon Moshiri was one of the most prominent and popular poets of Iran. Moshiri wrote fiction and poetry since she was a child. Her first short story was published in \"Sokhan\" (one the prestigious literary periodicals of pre-revolutionary Iran) when she was eighteen-years old. She was also a ballet dancer and a member of the National Iranian Ballet Company, where she danced in major classical ballet performances in the 60s and the early 70s. Moshiri left the ballet company to study playwriting at the College of Dramatic Arts. During the 70s, she wrote plays and short stories and went onstage as actress. In 1977, with a scholarship, she entered the graduate studies of drama at the University of Iowa. In 1979, after receiving master's degree in dramatic literature, she returned to Iran to teach at the College of Dramatic Arts. In this period, she wrote plays and short stories, and published translated literature from English into Persian. In 1983, the rehearsals of her full-length play were interrupted by the guards and the director and actors were arrested. She was purged from her job as a professor and a dramaturg and had no way other than exile. She left the country on foot, living in the refugee camps of Afghanistan and India. In the summer of 1986 she received right of asylum from the U.S. and a few months later entered the graduate program of creative writing at the University of Houston, where she received MFA in Fiction. She published novels and stories, taught literature, and held fiction workshops for the decades to come. == Works == Novels * At the Wall of the Almighty (1999) (novel) * The Batthouse (2001) (novel) * Against Gravity (2006) (novel) * The Bathhouse (2007) (audio book) * The Drum Tower (2014) (novel) Story collections * The Crazy Dervish and the Pomegranate Tree (2004) (short story) Opera * The Bricklayer (Opera Libretto) (2012) (opera)https://www.houstongrandopera.org/globalassets/publications-media-- news-items/press-releases/hgo-bricklayer-final.pdf Short stories in anthologies * A World Between (1999) (short story) * Red Boots & Attitude (2003) (short story) * Coloring Book (2004) (short story) * Let Me Tell You Where I've Been (2006) (short story) * At the Shepherd's (2007) (short story) * I Go to the Ruined Place (2009) (short story) * White Torture (2013) (short story) Foreign language translations * The Bathhouse (2001) (novel), translated into Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, and Indonesian == Awards and reviews == === Awards won === *Black Heron Press Award for Social Fiction for The Drum Tower (2014) *Barbara Deming Award for Feminist Writers (2013), for the novel in progress, Gazellehttp://demingfund.org/recent-grantees-pd-20.php *Winner of the Florida Review's 2008 Editor's Prize in Creative Non-Fiction *The 2006 Valiente Award of Voice Breaking Boundaries *Black Heron Press Award for Social Fiction for The Crazy Dervish and the Pomegranate Tree (2003) *Black Heron Press Award for Social Fiction for The Bathhouse (2001) *Barbara Deming Award for Peace and Social Justice (1999) *Barthelme Memorial Fellowship for Non-Fiction (1997) *The Prose Award of the University of Houston\u2013Clear Lake, Houston (1996) === Reviews and literary criticism === *J.
