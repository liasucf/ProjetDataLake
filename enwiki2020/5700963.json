    "text": "Lemming is a 2005 French psychological thriller film directed by Dominik Moll and starring Andr\u00e9 Dussollier, Charlotte Rampling, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Laurent Lucas. It was entered into the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. ==Plot== Alain Getty is a Home Automation Engineer who accepts a job in the south of France to work on a small camera drone in a technology company owned by Richard Pollock, and moves to a suburb of Toulouse with his wife B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte. After three months, Richard invites himself and his wife Alice to dinner at Alain's house. They arrive late and create a scene with their marital problems; Alice is very rude to B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte. Alain discovers a rodent lodged in the S-bend of the kitchen sink, which recovers after Alain retrieves it. A veterinarian identifies it as a lemming, a Scandinavian animal that does not live in France in the wild. The next evening Alice visits Alain, working late at his office. She says that Richard once tried to kill her and that the only reason she is still with him is to see him die. She attempts to seduce Alain, who resists her advances, but doesn't tell B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte about the incident. Alice visits B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte alone, and alludes to having had sex with Alain, before saying she feels tired. B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte shows her the guest bedroom, where she creates a mess and eventually shoots herself. B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte feels an urge to spend the night in the guestroom where Alice committed suicide. Despite Alice's death, Richard and Alain go on a business trip to Biarritz the next day. During the drive, Alain asks Richard if he had really tried to kill Alice. In response, Richard asks Alain if he and Alice had sex, which Alain denies. That evening, Alain calls B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte, who initially doesn't answer, then abuses him. Concerned, Alain decides to drive home immediately, although it is late and he is tired. He finds B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte sleeping and is unable to wake her. He hears noises coming from the kitchen, discovers it is full of lemmings and faints. Alain wakes up in a hospital; he crashed after falling asleep at the wheel, and the previous night's events were apparently a dream. Upon Alain's release from the hospital, he and B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte visit Richard's lakeside holiday chalet. B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte continues to behave coldly. She asks why Alain hadn't told her about Alice's attempt to seduce him, using the exact words Alice used that night and asks Alain to call her \"Alice\". They have sex and Alain falls asleep. When he wakes, B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte and their car are gone. Alain hitches a ride home and discovers that B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte started an affair with Richard while he was in hospital and is about to move into his house. Alain uses his drone to observe Richard's house, and finds B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte as expected. As Richard and B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte are about to have sex, the camera fails. It appears that Alice has taken control of B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte and resumed her life with Richard inside B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte's body. Meanwhile, the vet returns the lemming to Alain's house. The lemming bites Alain and disappears in the house. The next day, Richard confronts Alain at work with pieces of the drone he found in the garden. That evening, \"Alice- B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte\" visits Alain to offer him a deal: If he kills Richard, he would get B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte back. She gives Alain the key to Richard's house and leaves. That night Alain goes to Richard's house. He finds Richard and \"Alice-B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte\" asleep in the bedroom, and smothers Richard with a pillow while \"Alice- B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte\" watches. Alain carries Richard's body to the kitchen, where he operates the coffee-machine and the gas stove. \"Alice-B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte\" follows him to the car in a trance-like state. Back at their house, \"Alice-B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte\" goes straight to bed. When she wakes up, she is B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte again\u2014she says she dreamt of Alice, but doesn't remember any of the recent events. The next day, the couple are in their garden when they receive news of Richard's apparent suicide by causing a gas explosion in his house. B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte innocently asks Alain if he believes Richard committed suicide because of Alice's death. She then discovers the dead lemming and throws it away. The mystery of its origin is resolved by Alain in a voice over: Their neighbours' son had brought the animal from a family holiday to Finland; his upset father then flushed it down the toilet. Finally, Alain mentions that B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte is pregnant. ==Cast== * Laurent Lucas as Alain Getty * Charlotte Gainsbourg as B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Getty * Charlotte Rampling as Alice Pollock * Andr\u00e9 Dussollier as Richard Pollock * Jacques Bonnaff\u00e9 as Nicolas Chevalier * V\u00e9ronique Affholder as Francine * Michel Cassagne as Le v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire * Florence Desille as L'infirmi\u00e8re * Emmanuel Gayet as Le m\u00e9decin de garde * F\u00e9lix Gonzales as F\u00e9lix, le fils du voisin * Nicolas Jouhet as L'employ\u00e9 des eaux * Fabrice Robert as Bruno ==Reception== The film is generally well received by critics.
