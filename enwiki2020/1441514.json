Klakring (1904\u20131975), who was awarded three Navy Crosses as commander of the submarine during World War II. ==Construction and commissioning== Klakring was laid down on 19 February 1982 by the Bath Iron Works Corp. Bath, Maine; launched on 18 September 1982; sponsored by Beverly Bohen, niece of Rear Admiral Klakring; and commissioned on 20 August 1983 at Bath, Commander Leonard O. Wahlig in command. ==Service history== ===1980s=== ====1983==== Klakring completed a light-off examination on 8 September 1983, followed on 15 September by her initial crew certification. Prior to leaving for Charleston, SC, Klakring visited Newport, Rhode Island. The Klakring crew was able to explore Newport while the America's Cup battle was underway. Many sailors experienced getting their \"land legs\" back after their first days at sea. The ship reached her initial home port of Charleston, South Carolina, on 18 September. Family members and friends on the pier displayed homemade banners while they welcomed the ship as she maneuvered up the Cooper River on 28 September. The ship sailed for her shakedown cruise to Caribbean waters. She visited St. Thomas, Virgin Islands (4\u20137 November 1983), and on 13 November put into Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. Klakring sailed on 3 December, carried out a weapons systems accuracy test at Port Everglades, Florida, and then test-fired torpedoes on the range at Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC), St. Andros Island, on 13 December. She returned to Charleston on 16 December. Klakring in June 1983 ====1984==== Klakring carried out additional training during the New Year 1984, including a visit to Nassau, Bahamas (27\u201330 January 1984), a brief stop for fuel in Frederiksted, St. Croix, Virgin Islands, and another port visit on 18 February to Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico. Klakring completed her Post Shakedown Availability at Bath (5 April\u201323 August). The yard work included the installation of fin stabilizers. The ship conducted her sea trials on 29 September, and on loaded weapons from Norfolk, Virginia, on 7 September. Hurricane Diana swept up the East Coast and delayed the frigate's return to Charleston from her scheduled date of 11 September to 16 September. The ship completed a variety of training during the succeeding weeks, and escorted the aircraft carrier during mid November. ====1985==== Klakring sailed for nearly five weeks of refresher training off Guant\u00e1namo Bay on 14 January 1985. On 21 February, Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron (Light\u2014HSL-42) Detachment 3, equipped with a single Sikorsky SH-60B Seahawk Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) Mk III, embarked on board Klakring. The ship began participation in her first major fleet exercise, Composite Unit Training Exercise (COMTUEX) 2-85, on 22 April 1985. She broke up the training with a three-day visit to Frederiksted, U.S. Virgin Islands, and returned to Charleston on 8 May. The destroyer and Klakring sailed as MEF 3-85 Transit Group for the Middle East Force on 7 June 1985. This cruise marked the frigate's first overseas deployment. Comdr. Whalig served as the group's officer in tactical command (OTC).

Klakring sailed through the Strait of Hormuz, and on 7 July rendezvoused with command ship near Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE). The frigate escorted the flagship to Sitrah, Bahrain. During the ship's first two months in the Persian Gulf, visibility averaged barely because of haze, sand, and dust. The daily temperature repeatedly rose to with 90% humidity. The frigate's Seahawk flew an average of two sorties per day, and the crew reported that the presence of the strong temperature inversion made radar ranges of 160 nautical miles at altitudes below common, which extended the helo's patrol coverage of the region. The ship next visited Al Jubayl, Saudi Arabia (14\u201317 July 1985), briefly patrolled the Persian Gulf, and then completed upkeep at Mina Salman, Bahrain (22\u201331 July). On 6 August, Klakring escorted La Salle, and fueled and provisioned at Sitrah on 20 August. The frigate sailed from the Persian Gulf, and (25\u201328 August) visited Karachi, Pakistan.

In January, Klakring spent most of her time in the Charleston and Jacksonville OPAREA's conducting exercises. After completing a combat Systems Assessment on January l0, the ship arrived in Port Everglades, Florida on 13 January for a five-day port visit. While transiting back to Charleston, the ship encountered extremely rough weather with high winds and heavy seas. The Commanding Officer made the decision to enter port at night due to heavy weather, and the crew successfully conducted a difficult navigation detail in the Cooper River and returned Klakring to homeport during the stormy night. The last two weeks of February were spent preparing for Type Commander's Core Training (TCCT) 2-90 and conducting deck landing qualifications with Helicopter Anti-Submarine Light FORTY SIX in the Jacksonville OPAREA. On 22 February, the ship rendezvoused with the frigate and submarine just east of the Bahamas. Klakring arrived in Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico on 26 February, onloaded exercise torpedoes, and was underway to the Puerto Rico OPAREA to begin TCCT 2-90. During TCCT 2-90, the ship participated in numerous tracking and gunnery exercises, underway refuelings, highline transfers, and anti- submarine warfare evolutions. In addition, Klakring was selected to conduct two live missile firings along with the cruiser . Only one of the two missiles engaged the target due to a missile failure on the first missile fired. The event was significant in providing critical data needed in the performance evaluation of one of the Navy's primary weapons. The month of March consisted of an Operational Propulsion Plant Examination (OPPE) and a Change of Command Ceremony. The two-day engineering inspection was completed on 23 March. On 30 March, CDR Larry J. Carter relieved CDR Dennis J. Van Buskirk as the fourth Commanding Officer of the frigate.

All hands participated in an Integrated Logistics Overhaul offload of all shipboard parts and supplies completed on 16 May, and on 23 May, Klakring was dry-docked at Atlantic Dry Dock facility to begin the DSRA. The entire crew was moved into the Jacksonville Airport Days Inn Motel and would reside there for a period of 74 days. In early August, the crew moved out of the Days Inn Motel and returned to shipboard living. On 27 August, installation of the SQR-19 Tactical Towed Array Sonar System began. Klakring started the month of September preparing for the most important of a continued series of inspections: the Propulsion Examination Board Light-Off Examination (LOE). LOE commenced on 10 September and on 12 September she was \"certified to steam.\" The end of the overhaul period was drawing near, and on 14 September the ship was underway for the final phase: the post-DSRA sea trials. All systems proved reliable and Klakring was delivered on 17 September, thirty-one days ahead of schedule and under budget. The ship would remain at the Mayport Naval Station for another month. On 25 October, the ship got underway from Mayport and arrived at homeport Charleston one day later. Upon arrival, there was a Welcome Home Party held on board for all the families and friends of the crew. Klakring was scheduled to participate in Caribbean Law Enforcement Operations in November, but a post overhaul hull inspection brought about a change in plans. After careful examination of videos of an underwater hull inspect:ion, it was determined that the ship's hull would have to be repainted. Klakring was dry-docked from 7\u201321 November at the Charleston Naval Shipyard to undergo the necessary repairs. The ship successfully received full aviation certification on 27 November, and began final preparations for a Harpoon Missile Tactical Qualification. On 5 December, the ship was underway to embark HSL-48's Lamps MK III crew to participate in Destroyer Squadron Six \"Operation Greyhound\" for two days, fine tuning the skills of ship maneuvering and communications. In addition, Klakring turned north on 7 December en route to the Boston OPAREA to conduct at sea evaluations of the Navy's new Mk 50 Torpedo. Assisting aircraft were able to fire weapons, but continuously adverse weather conditions prevented Klakring and HSL-48 from doing so. The ship returned to Charleston on 19 December and began another extensive inspection the following day. The ship's Training Readiness Evaluation was completed on 21 December and the holiday stand down period began with a children's Christmas party held on board. USS Klakring ended 1990 in port Charleston. ====1991==== November, the day after Thanksgiving, the ship went underway for a six month cruise to the Persian Gulf for Operation Desert Shield. The ship conducted exercises in the Mediterranean with an eight day stop in Haifa, Israel before entering the Suez Canal. ===2000s=== From August to November 2000, USS Klakring (FFG-42) participated in UNITAS 41, conducting exercises with Latin American partner navies and circumnavigating South America. ===2010s=== From 2001, Klakring was homeported at NAVSTA Mayport, Florida, and was part of Destroyer Squadron 14. In March 2008 and 2009, the ship was the subject of protests in Sevastapol, Ukraine when it visited the port for five-day \"friendly\" visits. Klakring participated in Operation Earnest Will in the Persian Gulf in 1987 as the first air-capable, air- embarked ship.
