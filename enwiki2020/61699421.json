    "text": "NEPACCO, or the \"North Eastern Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals Co\" was a pharmaceutical and chemical company founded in 1966 in Stamford, Connecticut, best known for its role in the Times Beach Hazmat Incident. NEPACCO's main product was Hexachlorophene, which it began producing after leasing a Verona, Missouri based chemical production facility from Hoffman-Taff in 1969. As a byproduct of this process, Dioxin, most well known for its use in Agent Orange during the Vietnam War, was created. Although the Dioxin was initially held on site, it was eventually improperly disposed of in a trench in the facility, and by a local waste handler, Russell Bliss. Following the ban of Hexachlorophene in 1972, NEPACCO halted production on the site. By 1974, the company had liquidated all its assets, and was shut down by the Delaware Secretary of State in 1976. == See Also == * Times Beach, Missouri * Hoffman- Taff == References == Category:1966 establishments in Delaware Category:Companies based in Stamford, Connecticut Category:Chemical companies of the United States Category:Chemical companies established in 1966 Category:American companies disestablished in 1974 ",
