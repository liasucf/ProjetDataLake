The Las Vegas indie music community would soon form its own music festival to parallel that of the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. Founded by Thirry Harlin, James Woodbridge, and Jason Aragon, the music festival, known as Neon Reverb, which consisted of both national and local indie acts, experimented with genres such as Hip-Hop and punk rock as well as other culture related segments such as film and visual art that complement the music portion of the festival.
