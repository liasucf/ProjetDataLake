(1 June 1805David St Leger Kelly, 'H\u00fcbbe, Ulrich (1805\u20131892)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hubbe-ulrich-3808/text6041, published first in hardcopy 1972, accessed online 15 July 2016. \u2013 9 February 1892) was a German immigrant to South Australia, remembered for his part in framing the Real Property Act, which led to the Torrens title system of land registration. ==History== Dr. H\u00fcbbe was born in Hamburg in 1805, the third son of Heinrich H\u00fcbbe (1771\u20131847), and was educated at the Johanneum Gymnasium before studying law at Jena, Berlin, and the University of Kiel (then in Denmark), where he was awarded his LL.D. He arrived in South Australia aboard the Taglioni, 350 tons, from London in October 1842, and for a time worked for the South Australian Register before being involved as a land agent. The system of land title deeds which existed from the foundation of South Australia, as inherited from the Britain, was complex, open to abuse and disliked by both land agents and landowners, and seemed to have few supporters apart from traditionalists and lawyers. Suggestions for centralized registration of property were made in the earliest days after Proclamation by such as James Hurtle Fisher. Dr. H\u00fcbbe, who had personal experience with both the German system and the British, was one among many who wrote to the papers suggesting reform, but it was not until R. R. Torrens submitted his \"Real Property Act\" to the House of Assembly that any substantial effort towards reform was made. H\u00fcbbe, who was away from Adelaide around this time, returned in 1856 to find Torrens's campaign in full swing, and wrote, as \"Sincerus\", to The Register supporting the Act and making light of the difficulties in its implementation. Torrens, who was under siege from some powerful interests, sought out H\u00fcbbe as an ally, no doubt with an eye to enlisting the support of the equally powerful German community. In support of Torrens's campaign, H\u00fcbbe wrote a booklet The Voice of Reason and History on Conveyancing, drawing on his knowledge of European law, particularly that inherited from Hanseatic League States, but also of France. The cost of printing and publishing was met by G. F. Angas. Responding to commentators who claimed he was the unacknowledged father of the Real Property Act, H\u00fcbbe wrote: > ... I modestly disclaim as a matter of fact the honour of having originated > that Act, ... (although) I drew attention to the very objectionable features > of the English mode of conveyancing, and to the honest, unsophisticated mode > of transfer practised in Germany. ... The facts pointed out and the ideas > thus kindled in the minds of clear-sighted, practical men, who were > afterwards seen in the front rank of the contest, were no doubt farther > circulated, ... Torrens first laid down his scheme of legal reform, formed > his private committee; and prepared the public mind for the contemplated > change by a series of telling articles in the public journals.

My letters signed ' > Sincerus ' arrested Mr. Torrens' attention directly. He came to look for me > in my humble abode in Freeman-street, and we have ever since been firmly > allied.

L.L.D. [sic] A fine letter by H\u00fcbbe to the Editor > of the Gawler Bunyip. Ulrich and his wife lived with their teacher daughter Isabella from around 1875; at Spalding, then at White Hut. He was a deeply religious man of the Lutheran faith, and was blind for many years before his death, but having taught himself to read Moon type (an alternative to Braille) was able to console himself by reading the Gospels and Psalms. In the House of Assembly, in September 1884, E. W. Hawker moved, seconded by J. L. Stirling, that H\u00fcbbe be granted \u00a3200The Hansard figure. Other sources give \u00a3250 and \u00a3300. One correspondent claimed that an (unnamed) M.P. parlayed that sum into an annuity of \u00a350 for life, which would have turned out to be quite generous as he lived another six or seven years. in recognition of his contribution, given gratuitously, to Torrens's Act. One commentator called him \"one of the most unselfish, un-businesslike, and gentle creatures that ever lived\", and hoped that he would be better appreciated in an after-life. ==Family== Ulrich H\u00fcbbe married Martha Gray ( \u2013 29 July 1885) in 1847. *Martha Mary H\u00fcbbe (1 August 1848 \u2013 27 January 1881) married John Hood (c. 1839 \u2013 15 May 1924) in 1871.
