    "text": "Brora Rangers Football Club are a senior part-time professional football club from the village of Brora, Sutherland, in the Highland council area of Scotland. They play in the Highland Football League, of which they have been champions three times, having won their first title in 2013\u201314 and successfully defended it in the 2014\u201315 season. They were awarded the title in the incomplete 2019\u201320 season and are therefore the current title holders. They have also won the North of Scotland Cup six times. The Highland League Cup was won by the club for the first time in 2015\u201316. Nicknamed the Cattachs, Brora Rangers play at Dudgeon Park, Brora, and hold a rivalry with neighbours Wick Academy, in the Northern Derby. ==History== ===Early history=== Brora Rangers were founded in 1879. In 1933 they gained access to membership of the Scottish Football Association and entered the draw for the Scottish Qualifying Cup competition. They were accepted into membership of the Highland Football League in 1962. They won the North of Scotland Qualifying Cup competition in their centenary year, 1979, when they defeated Peterhead 5\u20130 on 17 November after a replay at Grant Street Park, Inverness, the teams having played a goal-less draw the previous week. ===History since 2013=== The club won their first ever Highland Football League title in the 2013\u201314 season after a 3\u20130 win against Keith on 5 March at Kynoch Park. They are the most northerly club to win the League title to date. They set several postwar Highland League records over the season: most points (95), greatest margin of victory in the league (20 points), highest win rate (31 out of 34), fewest goals conceded (16) and highest positive goal difference (+107). They ended the season with a 19-game unbeaten run which subsequently carried on into the 2014\u201315 season. With a draw against Fraserburgh in their 38th and final match of the year (across two seasons), Brora achieved the distinction of being unbeaten in league matches for the whole of 2014. Their unbeaten run in the Highland League eventually extended to 57 matches across three seasons, ending with a 3\u20130 defeat by Cove Rangers on 22 August 2015. For the 2014\u201315 season, they started in the second round of the 2014\u201315 Scottish Cup, and they played for the first time in the 2014\u201315 Scottish Challenge Cup but lost in the second round to East Fife 3\u20132. The club retained its Highland League title in the 2014\u201315 season, scoring a postwar record of 125 goals in a Highland League season, beating Inverness Thistle's previous postwar record of 124 in the 1969\u201370 season. With a record of 30 wins and 4 draws Brora ended the season as unbeaten champions, and were only the second club to complete an unbeaten season in the postwar era (following Caledonian in 1982\u201383). As Highland League champions, Brora entered the newly introduced promotion playoffs against Lowland League champions Edinburgh City. They won 4\u20132 in a penalty shootout after a 2\u20132 aggregate draw, with Stuart Kettlewell scoring the winner on 2 May. Brora played off against Montrose, the bottom-placed club in Scottish League Two, for a place in League Two for the 2015\u201316 season. After winning their home leg 1\u20130, Brora suffered a 3\u20131 defeat in the away game, thereby losing 3\u20132 on aggregate to remain in the Highland League. The prospect of a future promotion to the national leagues has proven controversial due to the distances that players and supporters would be expected to travel to many of the away games. Before the 2014\u201315 season began, it had been suggested that supporters would be allowed to vote on whether the club should join the Scottish Professional Football League were it to qualify for promotion. However following Brora's successful defence of their Highland League title, chairman John Young said that the club had \"looked at all options and there's no way we can avoid competing. We meet SPFL criteria for entry level so we can\u2019t opt out, we\u2019ve got to go for it.\" Besides the impact on the club, it has been suggested that Brora itself would benefit economically from players and supporters of Southern clubs visiting the town. The 2019-20 season was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and Brora were declared Highland League champions. They are due to progress to the playoffs with the Lowland League winner and the bottom club in League Two, but it is unclear when (if ever) these will be held. ==Stadium== Dudgeon Park Brora originally played at Inverbrora Park, which is now the site of the Hunters of Brora woollen mills, before moving to Dudgeon Park in 1932. The ground's capacity is 4,000, including 200 seats. The record attendance was set in 2013 when over 2,000 people watched Brora play Rangers in a friendly match. ==Management team== ===Corporate staff=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Position !!
