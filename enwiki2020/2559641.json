The BBC began showing the programme on BBC Three in June 2008. When asked about whether there would be a second series, Lilley stated, \"I never thought about it in the beginning because it was always a one-off thing. I'm not into just cashing in and rolling off into a second series that is not as good. I really enjoyed making the show, so the thought of writing and going back there again is really fun and exciting, but I haven't made a decision on what to do next.\" The characters from the show have gathered attention and praise from popular celebrities including Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, Lindsay Lohan, Ed Sheeran and Kylie Jenner. ===Angry Boys=== Lilley in 2012 The series Angry Boys aired on ABC in Australia and BBC in the UK in 2011 and HBO in the US in 2012. The 12-part comedy series featured six vastly different characters. In Angry Boys, Lilley plays multiple new characters in his third mockumentary series.

The series is produced by Melbourne-based production company Princess Pictures and Chris Lilley and is a co-production between the ABC in Australia and HBO in the US.

Lilley won the 2014 Silver Logie for Most Popular Actor for his performance in Ja'mie: Private School Girl. ===Jonah from Tonga=== On 26 November 2013, Lilley confirmed that he would be reviving Jonah Takalua for a new show in 2014, titled Jonah From Tonga. Jonah had been introduced in Lilley's 2007 series Summer Heights High. At the conclusion of that series, Jonah was expelled from Summer Heights High School. In this series, his father, Rocky Takalua, has sent him back to his homeland of Tonga to live with his uncle and their family in order to get Jonah's life back on track. The six-part series was produced by Princess Pictures and Chris Lilley in conjunction with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

In New Zealand M\u0101ori Television screened the first episode on 29 July 2017, but then withdrew later episodes. === Lunatics === In March 2018, it was announced that Lilley had been signed by Netflix to create a 10-part series, with the titular character not yet disclosed. Filming begun at the Bond University campus on the Gold Coast, Queensland. On 10 April 2019, a trailer surfaced online showing a number of new characters. The show is called Lunatics and features a group of eccentric characters with different talents or oddities. Alongside the series order announcement, it was confirmed that Lilley would star in the lead role. Lunatics was released on 19 April 2019 exclusively on Netflix. Lunatics features six different characters, all played by Lilley, which include: fashion retailer Keith Dick; estate agent Quentin Cook; 7-foot college student Becky Douglas; 12-year-old Gavin McGregor, who is an heir to an earldom; ex-pornstar Joyce Jeffries; and South African Jana Melhoopen- Jonks, a celebrity pet psychic who is also a lesbian. Lilley collaborated with The Jonas Brothers and Paris Hilton with his Lunatics characters Keith Dick and Jana Melhoopen-Jonks. == Personal life == Lilley has been vegetarian since the age of five. He dated Milly Gattegno from The Faders DJ from 2014 to 2016. Lilley currently resides in Melbourne, Victoria. == Controversies == Lilley's series Summer Heights High gained significant controversy, criticism and media scrutiny for its portrayal of such issues as mental disabilities, homosexuality, sexual abuse, and racism. Even before Summer Heights High aired, some community groups complained about a \"rape joke\" and Mr G's inappropriate \"touching\" of a boy with Down syndrome. The Herald Sun reported that parents and some teachers have considered the possibility that the show is influencing children to misbehave at school. Students were reportedly imitating Jonah and Ja'mie, repeating lines that were bullying, racist, and homophobic. Education Union branch president Mary Bluett stated in response that the show was \"clearly tongue-in-cheek\". After episode three, in which a character called Annabel dies after taking ecstasy, the family of Annabel Catt, a girl who died taking drugs at the 2007 Good Vibrations Festival in Sydney, complained that the program had been lampooning Annabel's death. ABC apologised to the family, stating that the situation was purely coincidental and assured them that the filming of the episode in question had been completed eleven days before her daughter's death. ABC thereafter began to display a message before each episode stating that there is no link between the series' characters and people in real life. On 29 July 2017, Lilley was the subject of criticism after posting a remix on his Instagram account of a music clip entitled \"Squashed Nigga\", starring the character S.mouse from Lilley's 2011 TV show, Angry Boys. The music video featured an indigenous boy lying on the ground with his arms splayed. On 24 July 2017, the court case based on the death of Elijah Doughty had ended in controversy and was the subject of pro-Aboriginal protests. Just like the real case, Lilley's music video described an Aboriginal boy being run over and killed. It was reported that many who criticised Lilley's bad timing were blocked from his Twitter account, with Lilley later deleting his social media accounts. Lilley's series Jonah from Tonga was called \"racist\" and resulted in protests from academics and Tongan youth concerned at the inaccurate and demeaning portrayals of Tongan culture. There was also criticism of his use of brownface. The creators of the 2004 ABC TV documentary series Our Boys stated that Lilley drew inspiration for the Jonah character from their work. The subject of Our Boys recalled being \"absolutely embarrassed, full of hate, angry and exploited\" by the \"racist\" Jonah character that was based on him. The series' director, as well as a teacher at Canterbury Boys High School also felt that the character \"exploited\" the Tongan students who Lilley had met while visiting the school after seeing Our Boys on television in 2004. Many major US civil rights organisations wrote to HBO expressing their \"deep concern\" over Jonah From Tonga. These included the NAACP, National Hispanic Media Coalition, American Indians in Film/TV, Empowering Pacific Islander Communities and The Asian Pacific American Media Coalition (which itself includes the Asian American Justice Center, Asian Pacific American Advocates, Japanese American Citizens League, Media Action Network for Asian Americans, National Federation of Filipino American Associations, and more).https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/12/chris-lilleys-jonah-is- not-from-tonga-i-am-its-time-to-dismantle-racist-brownface-stereotypes In 2019, Lilley was accused of blackface by journalists for his Lunatics character Jana Melhoopen-Jonks. Following the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, BBC iPlayer removed Jonah from Tonga from its online streaming service. On 11 June 2020, Netflix confirmed it had removed four of Lilley's series from its streaming service, also in response to the Black Lives Matter protests and movement.https://www.smh.com.au/culture/tv-and-radio/netflix- removes-four-chris-lilley-shows-from-library-20200611-p551g0.html In the weeks following these events, Lilley posted multiple videos of content involving the Jonah character to his YouTube channel. == Filmography == * The Monday Dump (2001) * Young Lions (2002) * Ned (2003) * Big Bite (2003) * Hamish & Andy (2004) * We Can Be Heroes: Finding The Australian of the Year (2005) *The Panel (2005) * Summer Heights High (2007) *The Spearman Experiment (2009) * Angry Boys (2011) * Ja'mie: Private School Girl (2013) * Jonah from Tonga (2014) * Stop Laughing...This Is Serious (2015) * Lunatics (2019) == Discography == * \u201cNaughty Girl\u201d (2007, ABC Records) \u2013 Mr G * Summer Heights High Official TV Series Soundtrack (2007, ABC Records) \u2013 Mr G, Jonah Takalua * \u201cSlap My Elbow\u201d (2011, ABC Records) \u2013 S.mouse * \u201dSquashed Nigga\u201d (2012, ABC Records) \u2013 S.mouse * Angry Boys Soundtrack (2012, ABC Records) \u2013 S.mouse * \"Learning To Be Me\" (2013, ABC Records) \u2013 Ja\u2019mie King * Chris Lilley Theme Songs (2014, ABC Records) *Lunatics Soundtrack (2019, ABC Records) ==Awards== |- ! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #DAA520;\" | Logie Awards |- |- ! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #DAA520;\" | Rose d'Or |- ==References== ==External links== *Chris Lilley official website *Chris Lilley official Facebook fan page *Chris Lilley official Twitter *Chris Lilley official Soundcloud * Category:1974 births Category:Australian stand-up comedians Category:Australian male comedians Category:Australian male television actors Category:Australian television writers Category:ARIA Award winners Category:People educated at Barker College Category:Macquarie University alumni Category:People from Sydney Category:Living people Category:Male television writers Category:Television controversies in Australia Category:21st-century Australian male actors ",
