    "text": "John Watts Young (September 24, 1930 \u2013 January 5, 2018) was an American astronaut, naval officer and aviator, test pilot, and aeronautical engineer. He became the ninth person to walk on the Moon as Commander of the Apollo 16 mission in 1972. He flew on four different classes of spacecraft: Gemini, the Apollo Command and Service Module, the Apollo Lunar Module, and the Space Shuttle. Before becoming an astronaut, Young received his Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology and joined the U.S. Navy. After serving at sea during the Korean War he became a naval aviator, and graduated from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School (Class 23). As a test pilot, he set several world time-to-climb records. Young retired from the Navy in 1976 with the rank of captain. In 1965 Young flew on the first crewed Gemini mission, and then commanded the 1966 Gemini 10 mission. In 1969, he flew as the command module pilot on Apollo 10. He was the commander of Apollo 16, and walked on the Moon's surface. Young also commanded two flights of Space Shuttle Columbia: STS-1 in 1981, the Space Shuttle program's first launch, and STS-9 in 1983. Young served as Chief of the Astronaut Office from 1974 to 1987, and retired from NASA in 2004. He died in 2018, at the age of 87. ==Early years and education== John Watts Young was born in at St. Luke's Hospital in San Francisco, California, on September 24, 1930, to William Young, a civil engineer, and Wanda Young (). His father lost his job during the Great Depression, and the family moved to Cartersville, Georgia in 1932. In 1936, the family moved to Orlando, Florida, where he attended Princeton Elementary School. When Young was five years old, his mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and taken to Florida State Hospital. Soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Young's father joined the Navy as a Seabee, and left Young and his brother Hugh in the care of a housekeeper. Young's father returned after the war and became a plant superintendent for a citrus company. Young attended Orlando High School, where he competed in football, baseball, and track and field, and graduated in 1948. Young attended the Georgia Institute of Technology on a Navy ROTC scholarship. He completed midshipman cruises aboard the , where he roomed with future Apollo 10 crew mate Thomas Stafford, and the . His senior year, Young served as the regiment commander of his ROTC detachment. He was a member of the honor societies Scabbard and Blade, Tau Beta Pi, Omicron Delta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi,, ANAK Society, and the Sigma Chi fraternity. In 1952, Young graduated second in his class with a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering, and was commissioned as an ensign in the US Navy on June 6, 1952. ==Navy service== Young applied to become a naval aviator, but was selected to become a gunnery officer aboard the out of Naval Base San Diego. He completed a Pacific deployment as fire control and division officer in the Sea of Japan during the Korean War. In May 1953, he received orders to flight school at Naval Air Station Pensacola. Young's first flew the SNJ-5 Texan in flight school, and was selected for helicopter training. He flew the HTL-5 and HUP-2 helicopters in training, and was designated as a helicopter pilot in January 1954. Young returned to flying the SNJ-5, and advanced to fly the T-28 Trojan, F6F Hellcat, and the F9F Panther. He graduated from flight school and received his aviator wings in December 1954. After flight school, Young was assigned to Fighter Squadron 103 (VF-103) at NAS Cecil Field to fly the F9F Cougar. In August 1956, he deployed with Sixth Fleet aboard the to the Mediterranean Sea. Young flew during the Suez Crisis, but did not fly in combat. His squadron returned in February 1957, and later that year began the transition to fly the F8U Crusader. In September 1958, VFA-103 deployed with Sixth Fleet on the to the Mediterranean Sea. In January 1959, Young was selected to be in Class 23 at the United States Naval Test Pilot School, and returned home from deployment. In 1959, Young graduated second in his class and was assigned to the Armament Division at the Naval Air Test Center. Worked alongside Jim Lovell, he tested the F-4 Phantom II fighter weapons systems. In 1962, he set two world time-to-climb records in the F-4, and reached in 34.52 seconds and in 227.6 seconds. In 1962, Young was assigned to fly with Fighter Squadron 143 (VF-143) until his selection as an astronaut candidate in September 1962. Young retired from the Navy as a Captain in September 1976, after 25 years. ==NASA career== Young during a pre-launch exercise of Gemini 3 In September 1962, Young was selected to join Astronaut Group 2. Young and his family moved to Houston, and he began his flying, physical, and academic training as an astronaut. After he completed his initial training, Young was assigned to work on the environmental controls system and survivor gear. Young's group selected the David Clark G3C pressure suit, and he helped develop the waste disposal and airlock development systems. ===Project Gemini=== ====Gemini 3==== In April 1964, Young was selected as the pilot of Gemini 3, which was commanded by Gus Grissom. The crew had originally been Alan Shepard and Tom Stafford, but were replaced when Shepard was diagnosed with Meniere's disease. Young and Grissom extensively checked out the capsule they would be flying in. Young advocated for a longer mission than the planned three orbits, but his suggestion was rejected. On March 23, 1965, Gemini 3 launched at 9:24 AM. During the flight, the crew evaluated food, waste management, riadiation tests, and spacecraft maneuvering. The Gemini 3 landed 60 miles short of its target area, but the capsule was successfully recovered aboard the . During the flight, Young smuggled a corned beef sandwich aboard, which he and Grissom shared while testing food. The House Committee on Appropriations launched a hearing regarding the incident, and some members argued that the two astronauts had disrupted the scheduled food test. ====Gemini 10==== Young following his Gemini 10 flight After Gemini 3, Grissom and Young were assigned as backup commander and pilot for Gemini 6A. On January 25, 1966, Young and Michael Collins were assigned as the commander and pilot. Gemini 10 launched as scheduled at 5:20 PM on July 18, 1966. Once in orbit, the crew attempted to navigate to their first Agena target vehicle rendezvous using celestial navigation. They were unable to navigate and required inputs from mission control, but successfully docked with the Agena target vehicle. Gemini 10 used the rockets on the Agena to maneuver and rendezvous with the Gemini 8 Agena, and set a new altitude record of . Gemini 10 successfully rendezvoused with its second target vehicle, and Young accomplished station keeping to keep the capsule close to the Agena vehicle while Collins conducted two EVAs to retrieve an experiment package. Young manually flew the reentry and landed from their recovery ship, the . ===Apollo program=== ====Apollo 10==== Young as the Apollo 10 command module pilot Young was originally assigned as backup to the second crewed Apollo mission, along with Thomas Stafford and Eugene Cernan. After the delays caused by the Apollo 1 fire, Young, Cernan, and Stafford were assigned as the Apollo 7 backup crew. In November 1968, Young was assigned as the Apollo 10 Command Module Pilot, with Commander Thomas Stafford and Lunar Module Pilot Eugene Cernan. On May 18, 1969, Apollo 10 launched at 11:49 AM. After the trans-lunar injection burn, Young successfully docked the command module (CSM) with the lunar module (LM). Young took celestial navigation measurements while enroute to the Moon as a contingency for a loss of communication. After Young performed the burn to enter lunar orbit, Stafford and Cernan entered the lunar module and undocked. The LM was flown down to , and ascended to a rendezvous with the CSM. Young flew alone in the CSM and prepared to maneuver to the LM in the event that its ascent engine did not work. After the rendezvous and docking, Young tracked landmarks in preparation for a lunar landing and flew the trans-Earth injection maneuver. On May 26, Apollo 10 reentered the Earth's atmosphere and safely landed at 11:52 AM east of Pago Pago. It was recovered by the and the crew returned to Houston. ====Apollo 16==== Young as the Apollo 16 commander American flag during Apollo 16 Young was assigned as the backup commander of Apollo 13, along with Charlie Duke and Jack Swigert. Duke exposed both the primary and backup crews to the German measles, causing Swigert to replace Ken Mattingly, who was not immune to German measles, two days prior to the launch. Young was assigned as the commander of Apollo 16, along with Duke and Mattingly. The mission's targeted landing site was the Descartes Highlands, and the crew conducted geologic surveys in volcanic fields to prepare for their EVAs. Apollo 16 launched at 12:54 PM on April 16, 1972. Apolo 16 successfully completed its trans-lunar injection burn, docked the CSM with the LM, and entered lunar orbit. Duke and Young entered the LM and undocked, but Mattingly soon reported an issue with the thrust vector controls on the service propulsion system (SPS), which would have prevented the CSM from maneuvering in case the LM was unable to complete its rendezvous. After four hours, engineers on Earth concluded that the issue was with an electrical circuit and backup thrust vector controls would allow the CSM to maneuver. Young and Duke were approved to descend, and the LM successfully landed in the Descartes Highlands, north and west of its target location. On April 21, Young and Duke began their first EVA. Young was the first to exit the LM, and his first words on the lunar surface were \"I'm glad they got ol' Brer Rabbit here, back in the briar patch where he belongs.\" The two astronauts set up the lunar rover, and Duke deployed the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP). Mission Control informed Young that the U.S. House of Representatives had passed the space budget, which included funding for the Space Shuttle. Young tripped over the cables to the heat flow sensors, which broke their communication link with Earth. The two astronauts conducted a seismic experiment using pneumatic hammers and began a traverse to Flag crater, which was west of the landing site. They set up a geology station at the crater, and collected Big Muley, a breccia that was the largest lunar rock collected during the Apollo program. Young and Duke traveled back towards the LM, stopping at Spook and Buster Craters along the way. Before ending the EVA, they tested the maneuverability of the lunar rover. They finished the EVA after 7:11 on the lunar surface. Young and Duke conducted their second EVA on April 22. They traveled to Cinco Crater to sample at three geology stations, with the goal of finding ejecta from the South Ray crater. After they traveled to collect samples at the nearby Wreck Crater, the rover's navigation system failed, forcing the two astronauts to manually navigate back to the LM. On their return trip, they saw the LM at a distance of , and stopped at the ALSEP location to take soil samples. They returned to the LM and finished their EVA after 7:23 on the lunar surface. The third EVA began on the morning of April 23. The two astronauts drove to North Ray crater. They photographed the exposed stratigraphy and collected rock samples, but did not find any volcanic rocks. They returned to the LM and parked the rover to allows its cameras to broadcast their ascent. They ended their EVA after 5:40; it was shorter than the previous two because of the delayed landing on the lunar surface. The LM module successfully ascended into lunar orbit and docked with the CSM. The astronauts transferred the of lunar samples that they collected and jettisoned the LM. The CSM completed its trans-Earth injection burn and began its flight back to Earth, during which time Mattingly conducted an EVA to recover film samples from an exterior camera and conduct an experiment on microbe exposure to ultraviolet sunlight. The command module (CM) reentered the atmosphere on April 27, and landed in the ocean at 19:45 UTC, approximately southeast of Christmas Island. The crew was recovered and brought to the and soon returned to Houston. After the mission, Young was assigned as the Apollo 17 backup commander, along with Duke and Stu Roosa as the backup LMP and CMP. The backup crew was originally the Apollo 15 crew, but Deke Slayton removed them from the assignment after learning about the Apollo 15 postal covers incident. ===Space Shuttle program=== In January 1973, Young was made Chief of the Space Shuttle Branch of the Astronaut Office. At the time, the overall Space Shuttle specifications and manufacturers had been determined, and Young's role was to serve as a liaison for the astronauts to provide design inputs. Young's office recommended changes for the orbiter's RCS thrusters, star tracker, and thermal radiators. In January 1974, he became Chief of the Astronaut Office after the departure of Alan Shepard. One of his first roles after taking over the office was overseeing the Apollo-Soyuz mission, but the remainder of the spaceflights during his tenure were conducted by the Space Shuttle. Young flew in the T-38 Talon chase planes for several of the Approach and Landing Tests of the . ====STS-1==== Young as Commander of STS-1, maiden Space Shuttle flight In March 1978, Young was selected by George Abbey, then deputy director of the Johnson Space Center, to be the commander of STS-1, with Robert Crippen flying as the pilot. Their backup crew, Joe Engle and Dick Truly, was the primary crew for STS-2. The development of Columbia was delayed because of the longer- than-predicted installation time of the thermal protection system. Young and Crippen trained to be able to repair thermal tiles in-orbit, but determined that they would be unable to repair the tiles during a spacewalk. The first attempt for STS-1 to launch was on April 10, 1981; the launch was cancelled due to a computer error. The weather on April 11 was unsuitable for a launch, which was delayed for another day. STS-1 launched on April 12, 1981 from LC-39A at the Kennedy Space Center. The first stage of the launch flew higher than anticipated, and the solid rocket boosters separated approximately higher than the original plan. The rest of the launch went as expected, and STS-1 successfully entered Earth orbit. The crew inspected their thermal tiles, and determined that some had been lost during launch. Amid concerns that the underside of Columbia may have also lost some thermal shielding, a KH-11 satellite was used to image the orbit and determine it was safe to reenter the atmosphere. Young and Crippen tested the orbital maneuvering capabilities of the orbiter, as well as its mechanical and computer systems. STS-1 reentered the atmosphere and landed on April 14 at Edwards AFB. ====STS-9==== Young eating on the Coluumbia middeck during STS-9 As the chief of the Astronaut Office, Young determined the crews that flew on the subsequent test and operational Space Shuttle missions. Young would routinely sit in the simulators alongside the crews to determine their effectiveness, and flew the Shuttle Training Aircraft to test landing approaches prior to the orbiter landing. In 1983, Young flew as the commander for STS-9 aboard . His pilot was Brewster Shaw, his two mission specialists were Owen Garriott and Robert Parker, and his two-payload specialists were Byron Lichtenberg and West German astronaut Ulf Merbold. The mission was initially scheduled to launch on October 29, 1983, but was delayed by an error with the right solid rocket booster. The flight launched from LC-39A on November 28, 1983. It carried the first Spacelab module into orbit, and the crew had to conduct a shift-based schedule to maximize on-orbit research in astronomy, atmospheric and space physics, and life sciences. Young tested a new portably onboard computer, and attempted to photograph Russian airfields as they orbited overhead. Prior to reentry, Columbia had two of its four primary General Purpose Computers (GPC) fail, which caused a delay in landing as they had to reset them and load the Entry Options Control Mode into an alternate GPC. After the GPC was prepared, Columbia successfully reentered the atmosphere and landed at Edwards AFB on December 8. ===NASA management=== Young remained as the chief of the Astronaut Office after STS-9. He was critical of NASA management following the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster and blamed disaster on the lack of proper communication channels within the Space Shuttle program. Young testified before the Rogers Commission, and was suggested improvements on the safety program at NASA. Young was scheduled to fly as the commander of STS-61-J to deploy the Hubble Space Telescope, but mission was cancelled as a result of the Challenger disaster. In May 1987, Young was replaced as the chief of the Astronaut Office by Daniel Brandenstein and was reassigned Special Assistant to JSC Director Aaron Cohen for Engineering, Operations and Safety. Young believed that his reassignment was the result of his public criticism of NASA management. Young oversaw the redesign of the SRBs to prevent a repeat of the Challenger disaster, and advocated for the strengthening of the TPS tiles at the chin-section of the orbiters. He continued to work on safety improvements in the Space Shuttle program, including improving the landing surfaces, installation of emergency drag parachutes, the inclusion of the Global Positioning System into the Space Shuttle's navigation system, and improving landing simulations. In February 1996, he was assigned as the Associate Director (Technical) of JSC. Young was involved in the development of the Shuttle\u2013Mir program and the design process for the International Space Station (ISS). After working at NASA for over 42 years, Young retired on December 31, 2004. Throughout his career, he had more than 15,275 hours flying time, including more than 9,200 hours in T-38s and 835 hours in spacecraft during six space flights. Additionally he spent over 15,000 hours in training to prepare for eleven primary and backup crew positions. ===Retirement=== The crews of STS-1 and STS-135 in 2011 Following his retirement, Young worked as a public speaker, and advocated for the importance of asteroid impact avoidance, colonization of the Moon, and climate engineering On April 12, 2006, Young and Crippen appeared at the 25th anniversary of the STS-1 launch at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex and spoke of their experiences during the flight. In November 2011, Young and Crippen met with the crew of STS-135, the last Space Shuttle mission. In 2012, Young published an autobiography, Forever Young. ==Personal life== In December 1955, Young married Barbara White of Savannah, Georgia, and they had two children, Sandra and John, and two grandchildren. They were divorced in the summer of 1971. Later that year, he married Susy Feldman and they lived in Houston. Young was friends with George H.W. and Barbara Bush, and vacationed at the Bush compound in Kennebunkport, Maine. Young died on January 5, 2018, at his home in Houston of complications from pneumonia, at the age of 87. He is interred at Arlington National Cemetery. ==Awards and honors== While he served in the Navy, Young was awarded the Navy Astronaut Wings, Navy Distinguished Service Medal with gold award star, and the Distinguished Flying Cross with two gold award stars. During both his military and civilian career with NASA, he received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal (1969) with three oak leaf clusters, the NASA Exceptional Service Medal, the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, the NASA Space Flight Medal, the NASA Exceptional Engineering Achievement Medal, the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal, and the NASA Exceptional Achievement Medal. Plaque of Young at the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame In 1982, Young was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1982, along with nine other Gemini astronauts. Young, along with the other 12 Gemini astronauts, was inducted into the second U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame class in 1993. In 1995, he was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum. In 2001, Young was inducted into the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame. Young was awarded the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1993. In 2010, he was awarded the General James E. Hill Lifetime Space Achievement Award He received the Exceptional Engineering Achievement Award in 1985, and the American Astronautical Society Space Flight Award in 1993. In 1998, he received the Philip J. Klass Award for Lifetime Achievement. He was a fellow in the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the American Astronautical Society, and the Society of Experimental Test Pilots. In 2005, Young was named as the NASA Ambassador of Exploration Florida State Road 423, a highway in Orlando and Kissimmee, Florida, is named John Young Parkway. John Young Elementary School, a school in the Orange County Public Schools was named after him. The planetarium at the Orlando Science Center was named in his honor. In October 2018, Northrop Grumman announced that the Cygnus spacecraft for their tenth cargo resupply mission to the International Space Station would be named S.S. John Young. Cygnus NG-10 successfully launched to the ISS on November 17, 2018, and concluded its mission on February 25, 2019. Asteroid 5362 Johnyoung was named after Young. ==In media== In the 1995 film Apollo 13, Young was played by Ben Marley. In the 1998 HBO miniseries, From the Earth to the Moon, he was played by John Posey. Young is one of the astronauts featured in the 2007 documentary film and book In the Shadow of the Moon, the 2007 documentary film The Wonder of It All, and the 2008 Discovery Channel series When We Left Earth. ==See also== *List of spaceflight records ==References== ==External links== *Interview with John Young for NOVA series: To the Moon WGBH Educational Foundation, raw footage, 1998 * * * Category:1930 births Category:2018 deaths Category:1965 in spaceflight Category:1966 in spaceflight Category:1969 in spaceflight Category:1972 in spaceflight Category:1981 in spaceflight Category:1983 in spaceflight Category:Apollo 10 Category:Apollo 16 Category:American astronauts Category:Aviators from California Category:Apollo program astronauts Category:People who have walked on the Moon Category:American aerospace engineers Category:United States Navy astronauts Category:NASA civilian astronauts Category:United States Astronaut Hall of Fame inductees Category:People from San Francisco Category:Georgia Tech alumni Category:United States Naval Test Pilot School alumni Category:United States Navy officers Category:United States Naval Aviators Category:Military personnel from California Category:National Aviation Hall of Fame inductees Category:American naval personnel of the Korean War Category:American test pilots Category:NASA people Category:Recipients of the Congressional Space Medal of Honor Category:Recipients of the Navy Distinguished Service Medal Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Category:Recipients of the NASA Distinguished Service Medal Category:Recipients of the NASA Exceptional Achievement Medal Category:Recipients of the NASA Exceptional Service Medal Category:American autobiographers Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Toastmasters members Category:Aviators from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Aviators from Florida Category:Military personnel from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Military personnel from Florida Category:People from Orlando, Florida Category:Project Gemini astronauts Category:Space Shuttle program astronauts Category:Burials at Arlington National Cemetery Category:Writers from San Francisco ",
