    "text": "Dinosaur Comics is a constrained webcomic by Canadian writer Ryan North. It is also known as \"Qwantz\", after the site's domain name, \"qwantz.com\". The first comic was posted on February 1, 2003, although there were earlier prototypes. Dinosaur Comics has also been printed in three collections and in a number of newspapers. The comic centers on three main characters, T-Rex, Utahraptor and Dromiceiomimus. Comics are posted every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Every strip uses the same artwork and panel layout; only the dialogue changes from day to day. There are occasional deviations from this principle, including a number of episodic comics. North created the comic because it was something he'd \"long wanted to do but couldn\u2019t figure out how to accomplish... [he doesn't] draw, so working in a visual medium like comics isn\u2019t the easiest thing to stumble into.\" ==Cast== *T-Rex, the main character that appears in all six panels. *Utahraptor, T-Rex's comic foil, appears in the fourth and fifth panels of the comic. *Dromiceiomimus appears in the third panel. She is generally friendly to T-Rex, answering either neutrally or with mild, friendly criticism. * The tiny woman in panel four and the house in panel three have contributed dialogue but are usually silent. * Other unseen characters occasionally contribute dialogue. For example, \"God\" speaks from off panel in bold all-caps, \"Satan\" speaks from off panel in dark red all-caps, T-Rex's sinister neighbours (raccoons and cephalopods) speak in italicized all-caps from off panel. ==Reception== Dinosaur Comics has received several awards and recognitions. It was named one of the best webcomics of 2004 and 2005 by The Webcomics Examiner. Wired listed Dinosaur Comics as one of \"Five Webcomics You Can Share With Your Kids\" and PC Magazine included the comic in its \"10 Wicked Awesome Webcomics\" list. Cracked.com named Dinosaur Comics one of the 8 funniest webcomics on the internet. In 2005, it won \"Outstanding Anthropomorphic Comic\" in the Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards. Soon after, in August 2005, Dinosaur Comics was accepted into the Dayfree Press. In 2006, the blook Dinosaur Comics: Huge Eyes, Beaks, Intelligence, and Ambition was a runner up for the Lulu Blooker Prize for comics. ==Collected editions== * The Best of Dinosaur Comics: 2003\u20132005 AD: Your Whole Family Is Made Of Meat (April 15, 2006, Quack!Media) * Dinosaur Comics fig. d: Dudes Already Know About Chickens (2010, TopatoCo) * Dinosaur Comics fig. e: Everybody knows failure is just success rounded down (2011, TopatoCo) * Dinosaur Comics fig. f: Feelings are boring, kissing is awesome (2012, TopatoCo) ==See also== *Attitude 3: The New Subversive Online Cartoonists (includes material from Dinosaur Comics) ==References== ==External links== * * i am other people: Ryan North -- Interview with Joey Comeau of A Softer World Category:2000s webcomics Category:2010s webcomics Category:2003 webcomic debuts Category:Canadian comedy webcomics Category:Dayfree Press Category:Dinosaurs in webcomics Category:Webcomics in print Category:Short form webcomics Category:Web Cartoonists' Choice Award winners ",
