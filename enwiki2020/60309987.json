    "text": "Conquest Pictures was a film production unit launched in 1917 as part of Thomas A. Edison Inc. It produced films for young people and families including subjects from popular children's authors such as Robert Louis Stevenson, Richard Harding Davis, Ralph Henry Barbour, and Mary Shipman Andrews. Anna M. Callan was in charge of the division. Its films were distributed through the George Kleine System. It closed in 1918 and its films were sold off as Edison exited the film production business. ==Background== Conquest's first release was July 14, 1917. The Conquest Pictures plan included weekly releases of 7 reels of film including varying content such as a main 4-reel film, a 1-reel comedy, a 1-reel travel feature, and magazine style news reel. The films could also be ordered individually. The programs were intended to be promoted by involvement from women's clubs who advocated for wholesome fare and marketed to educators and families. In February 1918, an advertisement touting Conquest Pictures programs ran in the Boy Scouts of America publication Boys Life. The ad compared the film programs to the Every Boy's Library calling them the \"Every Boy's Library of the Motion Picture World\". Edison's movie division faced stiff competition and difficult times in the World War I era. In 1918 the Lincoln and Parker Film Company of Worcester, Massachusetts acquired Edison film company assets and equipment as well as some of its film footage including Conquest's programs. ==Filmography== ===Conquest Program #2=== *Knights of the Square Table, a film adaptation from James A.
