Richmond was a painter as well as an educator. He was raised by a single mother in Manhattan's Lower East Side. He started teaching at a Brooklyn elementary school in 1967, and was a Yale graduate. As a rookie teacher, he coined the term \"microsociety,\" and created the first microsociety in his classroom in 1967 to combat students' lack of interest in the learning curriculum. A microsociety learning environment enables students to apply classroom knowledge to real world settings, for example, starting a business, making laws, and paying bills, etc. Richmond was invited to attend Harvard for his doctorate. His thesis, The MicroSociety School: A Real World in Miniature was published by Harpers & Row in 1973.Richmond, George (1973).
