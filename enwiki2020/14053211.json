    "text": "ROHM Theatre Kyoto, originally known as Kyoto Kaikan, is a concert hall and performance venue located in Kyoto, Japan. The main hall was first opened in 1960 and seated 2,005 patrons. The facility closed in 2012 and was redeveloped over a four-year period, reopening in January 2016. As well as the main concert hall, the facility also has two additional performance spaces seating 700 and 200 guests. Kyoto-based ROHM semiconductor saved the landmark post- modernist building from possible demolition by granting \u00a55.25 billion towards the cost of refurbishment. In recognition of this contribution, ROHM received naming rights to the building. ==See also== *List of concert halls *Kyoto Concert Hall ==References== == External links == * * * Heritage Alert ICOMOS International Scientific Committiee on Twentieth Century Heritage * Reply City of Kyoto Category:Concert halls in Japan Category:Buildings and structures in Kyoto Category:Tourist attractions in Kyoto Category:Kunio Maekawa buildings ",
