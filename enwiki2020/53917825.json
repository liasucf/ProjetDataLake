The album was intended to showcase Rough Trade's lineup to an American audience. The album comprises 14 singles by various Rough Trade artists. ==Reception== In 2013, Tal Rosenberg wrote in Chicago Reader that Wanna Buy a Bridge? \"...is probably best known as one of the finest, if not the finest, collection of British postpunk music.\" AllMusic's Todd Kristel gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars, concluding that \"Overall this may be the best single-album collection assembled of post-punk music.\" Another favorable review of the album was written by Robert Christgau, who gave it an A and called it \"superb\". Mark Richardson of Pitchfork later described the album as a key example of \"label comps actually [becoming] classics in their own right:\" \"I've never heard Wanna Buy a Bridge?, but the fact that I've heard of it, 23 years after its release, speaks to its classic status.\" ==Track listing== ==References== Category:1980 compilation albums Category:Rough Trade Records compilation albums Category:Post-punk compilation albums ",
