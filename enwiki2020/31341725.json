    "text": "The Millennium Transmitter is a high communications tower of ABS-CBN located at the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center, Mother Ignacia Street corner Sgt. Esguerra Avenue, Quezon City. It serves as a platform for television transmission antennas for both DWWX-TV and DWAC-TV, the respective flagship stations of ABS-CBN and ABS-CBN Sports and Action. It was also the former transmission tower of radio station DWRR until it was shifted when the Millennium Transmitter was upgraded by the end of 1999. ==History== Millennium Transmitter (right) before the renovation. The Millennium Transmitter, also called as the ABS-CBN Tower, was constructed at the corner of Mother Ignacia Street and Sgt. Esguerra Avenue, within the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Centre, at the time of its construction it was one of the tallest lattice towers in the world. Construction began in the third quarter of 1968. On March 21, 1969, the tower became operational, transmitting television and radio for ABS-CBN and also used to beam color broadcasts in Metro Manila, and to nearby provinces. After martial law was declared on September 21, 1972, as ABS-CBN suspended their operations the following day, the facility was taken over by the crony- owned BBC-2 from 1973 to 1979; state-run People's Television's predecessors GTV/MBS-4 also occupied the tower from 1974 to 1992 to beam their programs. When the EDSA Revolution happened, both the tower and Broadcast Plaza were stormed by reformist rebels as escalating battle occurred on February 24, 1986. After the revolution, the tower was returned to ABS-CBN. Since then, the tower became the primary source of transmission for both DWWX-TV and DWRR and later it began transmitting the company's sister UHF station DWAC-TV in 1996.
