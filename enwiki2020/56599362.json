Cheney, Bishop Andrzej z Wi\u015blicy , CatholicHerachy.org. ==Casreer== He has many times sent on behalf of Polish kings to the papal curia in Avignon. He held many church dignities, including a canonist from Wroc\u0142aw (from 1326), from Gniezno (from 1327) and from Cracow (from 1334). In 1347 he was appointed by Pope Clement VI as the Bishop of Pozna\u0144,Hierarchia Catholica, Volume 1, Page 408, and Page 539 which he did not take over as a result of counteracting King Casimir the Great, unwilling to accept the papal candidates. Therefore, in the following year he was appointed by the Pope a bishop of Sverige, where he efficiently managed the diocese for the next years. He was also the protector of the future chronicler Janka from Czarnk\u00f3w, who at his side achieved the first church dignities and fulfilled office and diplomatic tasks. ==References== Category:Bishops of Pozna\u0144 Category:Year of birth unknown Category:14th-century births Category:1346 deaths Category:14th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Medieval Polish nobility Category:14th-century Polish people ",
