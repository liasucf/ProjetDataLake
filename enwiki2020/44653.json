    "text": "Lapis lazuli (), or lapis for short, is a deep-blue metamorphic rock used as a semi-precious stone that has been prized since antiquity for its intense color. As early as the 7th millennium BCE, lapis lazuli was mined in the Sar-i Sang mines,David Bomford and Ashok Roy, A Closer Look- Colour (2009), National Gallery Company, London, () in Shortugai, and in other mines in Badakhshan province in northeast Afghanistan. Lapis lazuli artifacts, dated to 7570 BCE, have been found at Bhirrana, which is the oldest site of Indus Valley Civilisation. Lapis was highly valued by the Indus Valley Civilisation (7570\u20131900 BCE). Lapis beads have been found at Neolithic burials in Mehrgarh, the Caucasus, and as far away as Mauritania. It was used in the funeral mask of Tutankhamun (1341\u20131323 BCE).Alessandro Bongioanni & Maria Croce By the end of the Middle Ages, lapis lazuli began to be exported to Europe, where it was ground into powder and made into ultramarine, the finest and most expensive of all blue pigments. Ultramarine was used by some of the most important artists of the Renaissance and Baroque, including Masaccio, Perugino, Titian and Vermeer, and was often reserved for the clothing of the central figures of their paintings, especially the Virgin Mary. Ultramarine has also been found in dental tartar of medieval nuns and scribes. ==Major sources== Mines in northeast Afghanistan continue to be a major source of lapis lazuli. Important amounts are also produced from mines west of Lake Baikal in Russia, and in the Andes mountains in Chile. Smaller quantities are mined in Pakistan, Italy, Mongolia, the United States, and Canada. ==Etymology== is the Latin word for \"stone\" and is the genitive form of the Medieval Latin , which is taken from the Arabic , itself from the Persian , which is the name of the stone in Persian,Oxford English Dictionary and also of a place where lapis lazuli was mined. is etymologically related to the color blue and used as a root for the word for blue in several languages, including Spanish and Portuguese . ==Science and uses== ===Composition=== The most important mineral component of lapis lazuli is lazurite (25% to 40%), a blue feldspathoid silicate mineral with the formula (Na,Ca)8(AlSiO4)6(S,SO4,Cl)1-2. Most lapis lazuli also contains calcite (white), sodalite (blue), and pyrite (metallic yellow). Some samples of lapis lazuli contain augite, diopside, enstatite, mica, hauynite, hornblende, nosean, and sulfur-rich l\u00f6llingite geyerite. Lapis lazuli usually occurs in crystalline marble as a result of contact metamorphism. ===Color=== The intense blue color is due to the presence of the trisulfur radical anion (\u2212) in the crystal.

(Archived by WebCite\u00ae at https://www.webcitation.org/5wyiNxh3B?url=http://www.ch.imperial.ac.uk/rzepa/blog/?p=3604) results in a very intense absorption line at \u03bbmax ~617 nm. ===Sources=== Lapis lazuli is found in limestone in the Kokcha River valley of Badakhshan province in northeastern Afghanistan, where the Sar-e-Sang mine deposits have been worked for more than 6,000 years. Afghanistan was the source of lapis for the ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilizations, as well as the later Greeks and Romans. Ancient Egyptians obtained the material through trade with Mesopotamians, as part of Egypt\u2013Mesopotamia relations. During the height of the Indus Valley Civilisation, approximately 2000 BCE, the Harappan colony, now known as Shortugai, was established near the lapis mines. According to the Sorbonne's mineralogist Pierre Bariand's leading work on the sources of lapis lazuli in modern times, and to references in Afghanistan's Blue Treasure: Lapis Lazuli (2011) by Lailee McNair Bakhtiar, the lapis lazuli is found in \"caves\" not traditionally considered \"mines\" and the stone lapis lazuli is from the primary source of the Hindu Kush Mountains in Afghanistan's Kochka River Valley and not in Pakistan. In addition to the Afghan deposits, lapis is also extracted in the Andes (near Ovalle, Chile); and to the west of Lake Baikal in Siberia, Russia, at the Tultui Lazurite deposit. It is mined in smaller amounts in Angola, Argentina, Burma, Pakistan, Canada, Italy, India, and in the United States in California and Colorado. ===Uses and substitutes=== Lapis takes an excellent polish and can be made into jewelry, carvings, boxes, mosaics, ornaments, small statues, and vases. During the Renaissance, lapis was ground and processed to make the pigment ultramarine for use in frescoes and oil painting. Its usage as a pigment in oil paint largely ended during the early 19th century, when a chemically identical synthetic variety became available. Lapis lazuli is commercially synthesized or simulated by the Gilson process, which is used to make artificial ultramarine and hydrous zinc phosphates.Read, Peter (2005). Gemmology, Elsevier, p. 185. . It may also be substituted by spinel or sodalite, or by dyed jasper or howlite.Lapis lazuli, Gemstone Buzz.

Quantities of these beads have also been found at 4th millennium BCE settlements in Northern Mesopotamia, and at the Bronze Age site of Shahr-e Sukhteh in southeast Iran (3rd millennium BCE). A dagger with a lapis handle, a bowl inlaid with lapis, amulets, beads, and inlays representing eyebrows and beards, were found in the Royal Tombs of the Sumerian city-state of Ur from the 3rd Millennium BCE. Lapis was also used in ancient Mesopotamia by the Akkadians, Assyrians, and Babylonians for seals and jewelry. It is mentioned several times in the Mesopotamian poem, the Epic of Gilgamesh (17th\u201318th Century BCE), one of the oldest known works of literature. The Statue of Ebih-Il, a 3rd millennium BCE statue found in the ancient city-state of Mari in modern-day Syria, now in the Louvre, uses lapis lazuli inlays for the irises of the eyes. In ancient Egypt, lapis lazuli was a favorite stone for amulets and ornaments such as scarabs. Lapis jewelry has been found at excavations of the Predynastic Egyptian site Naqada (3300\u20133100 BCE). At Karnak, the relief carvings of Thutmose III (1479-1429 BCE) show fragments and barrel-shaped pieces of lapis lazuli being delivered to him as tribute. Powdered lapis was used as eyeshadow by Cleopatra. Moment of Science site, Indiana Public Media Jewelry made of lapis lazuli has also been found at Mycenae attesting to relations between the Myceneans and the developed civilizations of Egypt and the East.Alcestis Papademetriou, Mycenae, John S. Latsis Public Benefit Foundation, 2015, p. 32. Pliny the Elder wrote that lapis lazuli is \u201copaque and sprinkled with specks of gold\u201d. Because the stone combines the blue of the heavens and golden glitter of the sun, it was emblematic of success in the old Jewish tradition. In the early Christian tradition lapis lazuli was regarded as the stone of Virgin Mary. In late classical times and as late as the Middle Ages, lapis lazuli was often called sapphire (sapphirus in Latin, sappir in Hebrew), though it had little to do with the stone today known as the blue corundum variety sapphire. In his book on stones, the Greek scientist Theophrastus described \"the sapphirus, which is speckled with gold,\" a description which matches lapis lazuli.Theophrastus, On Stones (De Lapidibus) \u2013 IV-23, translated by D.E. Eichholtz, Oxford University Press, 1965. There are many references to sapphires in the Old Testament, but most scholars agree that, since sapphire was not known before the Roman Empire, they most likely are references to lapis lazuli. For instance, Exodus 24:10: \"And they saw the God of Israel, and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone...\" (KJV). The term used in the Latin Vulgate Bible in this citation is \"lapidus sapphiri\", the term for lapis lazuli.Pearlie Braswell-Tripp (2013), Real Diamonds and Precious Stones of the Bible Modern translations of the Bible, such as the New Living Translation Second Edition,\"In His Image Devotional Bible\" refer to lapis lazuli in most instances instead of sapphire. == Gallery == Oriental Institute Museum.
