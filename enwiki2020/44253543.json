During the British Regime and thereafter from KALAs regime no development work was done in these villages. Underground water owing to the nearby Salt Range is sour qua Salt. During Khizer Hayat Tiwana Regime Canal was built which irrigates the village. The best Basmati is grown in the village Dhak Janjua. Owing to being on the tail of the canal now water resources are meagre to meet the purpose, therefore the poor Farmers families are selling their agricultural land on throw-away price and are leaving for nearby cities. ==References== ==External links== *Official Web Site of Pakistan Railways Category:Railway stations in Khushab District Category:Railway stations on Malakwal\u2013Khushab branch line ",
