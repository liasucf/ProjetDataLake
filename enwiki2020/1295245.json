    "text": "My Big Fat Obnoxious Boss was a television show on the Fox Network that was filmed in July 2004 and aired from November\u2013December 2004. Similar to My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance, it was a parody of shows such as The Apprentice. The contestants performed several tasks that they were all told would help them win a job at the Chicago-based conglomerate IOCOR and a $250,000 prize. However, none of the contestants knew that the company \u2013 and the position \u2013 were fake. The show was usually punctuated by the actions of the \"boss\" Mr. N. Paul Todd, whose name was an anagram of that of Donald Trump. The contestants learn about his multibillion-dollar venture capital firm IOCOR, and in any episode, he or a member of his \"family\" could usually be found doing something either to unsettle the contestants or to test the limit of their blindness to truth. Fox advertised the show, along with another Apprentice-inspired show called The Rebel Billionaire, during the 2004 Major League Baseball playoffs. But the show received low ratings in the United States and was cancelled after five episodes. Fox released the remaining 5 episodes online in late March 2005. All 10 episodes were broadcast in full in the UK on Channel 4 (and on Channel 4's sister station E4), in Australia on Channel 7 and later Fox8, in Singapore on Channel 5, in Poland on TV4 and Polsat, in Malaysia on 8TV and in Denmark on SBS Net. In 2008, the entire series \u2013 including the five unaired episodes in the US \u2013 aired on Fox Reality Channel. The show has attained a cult status and a good fan base in spite of its small run. ==Rules== The rules of the game were similar to The Apprentice. The contestants were split into teams, with a team boss immune from elimination. The teams would then compete in a challenge to determine which would be eliminated. Some of the tasks endured by the contestants included selling hot soup on a hot day, creating and selling art they made out of scraps, and selling other ridiculous products. The members of the losing team met Mr. Todd in the boardroom on the next day, where he derided their performance. The team boss nominated two teammates for elimination \u2013 because Mr. Todd explained that, in real life, the boss is never held responsible. The player not eliminated became the team boss, and the winning team named a new team boss. The audience would then see N. Paul Todd referring to \"the real boss\" for the decision on who was to go. The real boss was not seen or heard until the final episode, and was kept a complete secret from the contestants. The official website suggested that the real boss could be Donald Trump's ex-wife Ivana Trump or Oprah Winfrey, although David Hickman did refer to the boss as a \"him.\" The real boss gave no reason for the decision, so Todd was given free rein to make it up as he went along. In the final episode, \"the real boss\" was revealed to be a chimpanzee who responded to the name of \"Mowgli\" and who made his decisions by spinning a wheel with the names of the contestants. ==N. Paul Todd== N. Paul Todd was played by actor William August, a graduate of Harvard University and an experienced California attorney. August described Todd as a man who \"probably has a number of sexual harassment lawsuits pending.\" Todd's catchphrase for elimination was \"Get the hell out of my office.\" Another of his catchphrases was \"Welcome to my world.\" A variety of assistants helped Mr. Todd with his contests. His alleged Vice President Jamie Samuels is sent to hate the women, while the COO David Hickman is \"a little too excited about these fresh-faced young men.\" Mr. Todd also relies on his wife Lynn and his son Kent to help judge the competition when a member of the executive team is not available. Mr. N. Paul Todd is an anagram of Donald Trump, host of the Apprentice at that time. ==Cast== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"left\" width=\"150\"| Role !align=\"left\" width=\"150\"| Real name !align=\"left\" width=\"300\"| \"Position\" |- |align=\"left\"| N.

Each team was responsible for naming their opponent. The men named the female team Femron, a portmanteau of female and Enron. The women named the male team Concad, a portmanteau of con and cad. The teams were re- organized in episode 4. At the beginning of episode 8, the remaining five players were combined into a united team for an elimination, where Damien was named team boss. Afterwards, the four players left over were split into two teams for the episode's challenge. Following that challenge, the three finalists were on their own. {| class=\"wikitable\" !bgcolor=\"gray\"|Candidate !bgcolor=\"gray\"|Episode 1 team !bgcolor=\"gray\"|Episode 4 team !bgcolor=\"gray\"|Episode 8 team !bgcolor=\"gray\"|Result !bgcolor=\"gray\"|Team Boss (Win/Loss) |- | Annette Dziamba |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFB6C1\"|Femron |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFB6C1\"|Femron |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFB6C1\"|Femron |align=\"center\"|Winner |1-2 (win in task 5, loss in tasks 2 & 7) |- |Michael Gregorio |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#6495ED\"|Concad |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFB6C1\"|Femron |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#6495ED\"|Concad |align=\"center\"|Runner-up |0-1 (loss in task 1) |- |Kerry McCloskey |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFB6C1\"|Femron |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#6495ED\"|Concad |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFB6C1\"|Femron |align=\"center\" |Eliminated in episode 10 |0-2 (loss in tasks 3 & 5) |- |Damien Scott |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#6495ED\"|Concad |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#6495ED\"|Concad |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#6495ED\"|Concad |align=\"center\" |Eliminated in episode 9 |2-0 (win in tasks 3 & 7) |- |David Harper |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#6495ED\"|Concad |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#6495ED\"|Concad | |align=\"center\" |Eliminated in episode 8 |1-1 (win in task 6, loss in task 4) |- |Douglas Dennard |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#6495ED\"|Concad |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFB6C1\"|Femron | |align=\"center\" |Eliminated in episode 7 |0-1 (loss in task 6) |- |Whitney LaBelle |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFB6C1\"|Femron |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFB6C1\"|Femron | |align=\"center\" |Eliminated in episode 6 |1-0 (win in task 4) |- |Robert Hospidor |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#6495ED\"|Concad |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#6495ED\"|Concad | |align=\"center\" |Eliminated in episode 5 |1-0 (win in task 2) |- |Tonia Jacobs |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFB6C1\"|Femron |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#6495ED\"|Concad | |align=\"center\" |Eliminated in episode 4 |1-0 (win in task 1) |- |Elli Frank |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFB6C1\"|Femron | | |align=\"center\" |Eliminated in episode 3 | |- |Christy Hollie |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFB6C1\"|Femron | | |align=\"center\" |Eliminated in episode 2 | |- |Daniel Richardson |align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#6495ED\"|Concad | | |align=\"center\" |Eliminated in episode 1 | |} {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! colspan=\"16\"| Elimination chart |- !Candidate !1 !2 !3 !4 !5 !6 !7 !8 !9 !10 !11 |- !
