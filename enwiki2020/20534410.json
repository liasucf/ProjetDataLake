    "text": "2015 Tallinn Black Nights Film festival Award Ceremony Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival, or P\u00d6FF (), is an annual film festival held since 1997 in Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia. P\u00d6FF is the only festival in Northern Europe or the Baltic region with a FIAPF (International Federation of Film Producers Association) accreditation for holding an International Competitive Feature Film Program, which places it alongside 14 other non-specialised competitive world festivals including Berlin, Cannes, Venice, Karlovy Vary, Warsaw, and San Sebastian. With over 250 feature-length and over 250 short films and animations from 80 different countries (2018) screened, and an attendance of over 80,000 (2018), P\u00d6FF is the one of the largest film festivals in Northern Europe. The festival, its sub-festivals and the audiovisual industry platform Industry@Tallinn hosted around 1200 film professionals and journalists in 2018. Running concurrently with the festival is Industry@Tallinn and the Baltic Event Co-Production Market, the biggest audiovisual industry meeting in the region. Industry@Tallinn consists of the International Sales and Distributors Meeting Point; the European Genre Forum, a creative camp for genre professionals promoting project and skills development; and two works in progress panels, the presentations of regional upcoming films from Baltic, Finnish and old CIS countries, and international screenings ranging from Asia to Latin America. For 2017 the festival has teamed up with the Culture Ministry of Estonia to co-host and co-curate the Estonia\u2019s European Union Presidency Conference Pictured Futures: Connecting Content, Tech & Policy In Audiovisual Europe. In addition, two sub-festivals take part concurrently with the main program: Children\u2019s and Youth Film Festival Just Film, and P\u00d6FF Shorts, dedicated to short films and animations . BNFF also organises two smaller off-season events: the only genre film event in the Baltic countries Haapsalu Horror and Fantasy Film Festival taking place in April every year and Tartu Love Film Festival tARTuFF, taking place in August. ==History== Starting in 1997 with 4,500 attendances, P\u00d6FF was originally primarily a showcase for Nordic films, but as the festival grew it dramatically expanded its overview. Today P\u00d6FF is the largest film gathering in Northern Europe. During its 19th edition in 2015, the festival screened more than 600 films (including 250+ feature-length films from 80 different countries), bringing over 900 screenings to an audience of over 80,000 people, including over 700 accredited guests and journalists from 50 countries. In 2010 the festival hosted the European Film Awards ceremony in Tallinn, and in 2015 the European Film Forum conference was held in co-operation with the European Commission. P\u00d6FF was recognized by FIAPF in 2011 and upgraded to an A-list festival in 2014, making it the first festival in Northern Europe to gain a Competitive Feature Film Festival accreditation, joining only 14 other major world festivals. Some notable filmmakers, actors, and industry professionals who have visited P\u00d6FF include Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki, Krzysztof Zanussi, Olga Kurylenko, Sergei Loznitsa, Lee Joon-ik, Jos Stelling, Jan Troell, Catherine Breillat, Roy Andersson, Fridrik Thor Fridriksson, Neil Jordan, Philip Glass, Lukas Moodysson, Michael Nyman, Jerzy Stuhr, Tom Schilling, Pen- ek Ratanaruang, Isaach de Bankole, Pavel Lungin, Fiona Shaw, Ross Partridge, and Mikael Persbrandt, along with many others. ==Awards== ===Official Selection=== *Grand Prix for the Best Film *Jury prize for Best Director *Jury Prize for Best Script *Jury Prize for Best Actress *Jury Price for Best Actor *Jury Prize for Best Cinematographer *Jury Prize for Best Music *Award by the jury of International Federation of Film Critics (FIPRESCI) *Cross Religion award presented by spiritual leaders of largest congregations in Estonia ===The First Feature Competition=== *Best Film Award *2X Jury Special Prize ===The Baltic Film Competition=== * Best Baltic Film ===Additional Awards for Feature-Length Films=== *Audience Award *Rebel with a Cause Award *Award for Best Asian film by the jury of Network for the Promotion of *Asian Cinema (NETPAC) *Bruno O\u2019ya Award *Lifetime Achievement Award ===Grand Prix winners=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
