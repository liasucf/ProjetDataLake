He left to join Everton in April 1976 for a fee of \u00a335,000 and became a crowd favourite with his tremendous skills in midfield and a knack for scoring goals.

He joined Queens Park Rangers in September 1980 for a 400,000 pound fee and made his debut against Sheffield Wednesday.

In all King played 30 league games for QPR scoring 9 goals before a transfer to West Bromwich Albion in September 1981. King returned to Everton in July 1982 for two seasons, subsequently playing for Dutch side Cambuur Leeuwarden then Swedish team \u00d6rebro SK, before joining Wolverhampton Wanderers in January 1985. He returned to Luton Town in December the same year, but made just three league appearances before moving to Aldershot in August 1986.

He led Mansfield to the Third Division play- offs in the 1994\u201395 season, losing in the semi-finals to Chesterfield. They failed to build on this the following season and King left in July 1996 after Mansfield had finished in 19th place. He later worked as a coach and a scout, and was scouting for Sunderland when, in the 2000 close season, he joined Swindon Town as assistant manager under his former Everton teammate Colin Todd. In November 2000, after Todd had left to become assistant manager of Derby County, King took over as manager. He maintained Swindon's Second Division status that season, but was replaced by former Liverpool manager Roy Evans in June 2001. Evans remained in charge for just a few months and King was re-appointed as Swindon manager on 20 December 2001 after the arrival of new owners of the club (including the former jockey Willie Carson). The peak of his Swindon career came in the 2003\u201304 season, when Swindon qualified for the Division Two playoffs, only to lose on penalties to Brighton and Hove Albion in the semi-finals. King was eventually dismissed by Swindon on 26 September 2005, after five successive defeats had left Swindon second from bottom in Football League One.
