With the emergence of Islam the meaning of shayatin moved closer to the Christian concept of devils.Jeffrey Burton Russell Lucifer: The Devil in the Middle Ages Cornell University Press 1986 page 55 The term shayatin appears in a similar way in the Book of Enoch; denoting the hosts of the devil.James Windrow Sweetman Islam and Christian Theology: Preparatory historical survey of the early period. v.2.

In the story of Adam and Eve, a shaitan tempts Adam to eat from the forbidden tree, arguing, God only prohibited its fruit, so they shall not become immortal, as narrated in . According to shayatin rise against heaven in attempt to steal its secrets, but are chased by meteorites, however, unlike the jinn, may partly succeed, snapping some information.Eichler, Paul Arno, 1889 Die Dschinn, Teufel und Engel in Koran [microform] p. 31. (German) mentions the shayatin as the teachers of sorcery. describes the fruits of Zaqqum, the tree of hell, as heads of shayatin. Surah mentions shayatin among Ins (humans) and jinn (jinn). According to some exegetes, the term is used as an epithet to describe rebellious men and jinn, but to others, referring to shayatin who tempt among the jinn, and whose, who tempt among humans.Teuma, E. (1984). More on Qur'anic jinn. Melita Theologica, 39(1\u20132), 37\u201345. ===Hadith=== The hadith-literature depicts the shayatin as malevolent forces closely bound to humans and points to the presence of a Muslim's everyday life. A shaitan is assigned to every human (with Jesus as exception), and shayatin are said to move through the blood of human. Sahih Muslim mentions among the shayatin five sons of Iblis, who bring everyday calamities: Tir, \u201cwho brings about calamities, loses, and injuries; Al-A\u2019war, who encourages debauchery; Sut, who suggests lies; Dasim, who causes hatred between man and wife; Zalambur, who presides over places of traffic.\" Shayatin try to disrupt the prayer or the ablution. Further they might appear in dreams, and terrorize people. When someone yawns, the mouth should be covered, since the shayatin might enter the body. The sun is said to set and rise between the horns of a shaitan, when prayers should cease, since this is the moment the doors of hell opened.Awn Satan's Tragedy and Redemption: Ibl\u012bs in Sufi Psychology. With a Foreword by A. Schimmel Brill, 2018 pp. 45\u201360 Sahih al-Bukhari and Jami` at-Tirmidhi state that the shayatin can not harm the believers during the month of Ramadan, since they are chained in Jahannam (Gehenna (hellfire)).Tobias N\u00fcnlist (2015). D\u00e4monenglaube im Islam. Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG. . p. 229 (in German). ===Exegesis=== The shayatin make up one of three classes of supernatural creatures in Islamic theology. But since they share, like jinn the characteristics of invisibility, some scholars put them merely under one category of the supernatural. However the prevailing opinion among the mufassirs distinguish between the jinn and shayatin as following:Egdunas Racius ISLAMIC EXEGESIS ON THE JINN: THEIR ORIGIN, KINDS AND SUBSTANCE AND THEIR RELATION TO OTHER BEINGS p. 132Amira El- Zein Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn Syracuse University Press 2009 p. 21 * While among the jinn, there are different types of believers (Muslims, Christians, Jewish, polytheists, etc.), the shayatin are exclusively evil. * The jinn are mortals and die, while the shayatin only die when their leader ceases to exist. The father of the jinn is Al-Jann and the father of the shayatin is Iblis. The shayatin are beings of the hell-fire,Fahd, T. and Rippin, A., \u201cS\u0332h\u0332ay\u1e6d\u0101n\u201d, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E.

Hodgson The Venture of Islam, Volume 2: The Expansion of Islam in the Middle Periods, Volume 2 University of Chicago Press, 2009 p. 449 and although their origin is, like that of the angels, not mentioned in the Quran, Islamic scholars repeatedly asserted the idea, that the shayatin have been created from either smokeSeyyed Hossein Nasr Islamic Life and Thought Routledge 2013 p. 135 or the hell-fire itself.ANTON M.

HEINEN BEIRUT 1982 p. 143 Comparable to demons or devils in Christian theology, shayatin are incapable of good and limited to \"evil\". Abu Mufti writes in his commentary of Abu Hanifa's al-Fiqh al-absat, that all angels, except with Harut and Marut, are obedient but all shayatin, except Ham ibn Him Ibn Laqis Ibn Iblis, are created evil. Only humans and jinn are created with Fitra, that means, both angels and shayatin lack free-will and are settled in opposition.Abu l-Lait as-Samarqandi's Comentary on Abu Hanifa al-Fiqh al-absat Introduction, Text and Commentary by Hans Daiber Islamic concept of Belief in the 4th/10th Century Institute for the Study of Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa p. 243 Some Sufi-writers connect the descriptions of shayatin mentioned in hadith to human's psychological conditions. Based on the notion that the shayatin reproduce by laying eggs into the heart of humans, Ghazali linked them to inner spiritual development. Accordingly, from the eggs laid on the heart, the offspring of Iblis grew and unite with the person, causing the sin the shaitan is responsible for.Peter J. Awn Satan's Tragedy and Redemption: Iblis in Sufi Psychology, Brill, 1983 p. 58 He further explains the difference between divine inspiration and the devilish temptations of the shayatin, by asserting, one should test the inspiration by two criteria: The first tests the piety, the second, whether or not the suggestion is in accordance with sharia.Abdullahi Hassan Zaroug \"AI-Ghazali's Sufism: A Critical Appraisal\", Intellectual Discourse, 1997 p. 150 He further elaborates an esoteric cosmology, visualizing human's heart as the capital of the body, which is in constant struggle between the powers of carnal desires invoked by the shayatin, and the powers of reason ('aql).Jurnal Ilmiah ISLAM FUTURA Vol. 17. No. 2, Februari 2018, THE INTERTWINED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NAFS (CARNAL SOUL), AQL (REASONING) QALB (HEART) Hyder Gulam Australian National Imams Council p. 207 Ali Hujwiri similarly describes the shayatin and angels mirroring the human psychological condition, the shayatin and carnal desires (nafs) on one side, and the spirit (ruh) and the angels on the other.SHIGERU KAMADA* A STUDY OF THE TERM SIRR (SECRET) IN SUFI LATA'IF THEORIES p. 18 == Folklore == Shayatin are assumed to visit filthy or desacralized places.Marion Holmes Katz Body of Text: The Emergence of the Sunni Law of Ritual Purity SUNY Press, 2012 p. 13 They tempt humans into sin and to everything that is disapproved by society, by their whisperings.Gerda Sengers Women and Demons: Cultic Healing in Islamic Egypt Brill, 2003 p. 254 It is commonly believed, that saying bismillah, reciting a certain du'a (supplication), like \"A'uzu Billahi Minesh shaitanir Rajiim\" or the Suras \"An-Naas\" or \"Al-Falaq\"Rudolf Macuch \"Und das Leben ist siegreich!\": mand\u00e4ische und samaritanische Literatur ; im Gedenken an Rudolf Macuch (1919\u20131993) Otto Harrassowitz Verlag 2008 p. 82 could ward off attacks of shayatin.Gerda Sengers. Women and Demons: Cultic Healing in Islamic Egypt. Brill, 2003. . p. 41. Although it is impossible to gather all depictions of local traditions on folk Islam, these characteristics appear frequently. Since the Quran states in that it was not Solomon who practised witchcraft but rather the shayatin. Witchcraft is also traced back to the shayatin (compare with the Christian understanding). ==See also== * Asrestar * Daeva * Dajjal * Div * Ghoul * Marid * Nafs * Qareen == Notes == ==References== Category:Demons in Islam Category:Devils Category:Jahannam Category:Occultism (Islam) Category:Satan ",
