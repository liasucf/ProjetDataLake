    "text": "Gates to Purgatory is the first studio album by Running Wild, released in 1984. It predates their piracy themes and has mostly satanically-influenced lyrics but also features songs with anarchic and libertarian (in the sense of European libertarianism) themes. It was in part of Gerald \"Preacher\" Warnecke's studies in theology. He left the band soon after the album's release to become a vicar. The album has sold over 235,000 copies worldwide. The album was reissued in 2012 by Lemon records, as well as in 2017 by Noise records. ==Track listing== All tracks written by Rolf Kasparek except where noted ==Notes== * The bonus track \"Walpurgis Night\" cuts off very close to the end due to the condition of the master tape on most releases * The 1991 Japanese release contains the 1985 album Branded and Exiled ==Personnel== *Rolf Kasparek \u2013 guitar, vocals *Gerald \"Preacher\" Warnecke \u2013 guitar *Stephan Boriss \u2013 bass guitar *Wolfgang \"Hasche\" Hagemann \u2013 drums ==Production== * Horst M\u00fcller \u2013 recording * D.
