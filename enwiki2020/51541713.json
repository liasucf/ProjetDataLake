In their fifth season under head coach Mike Price, the Cougars compiled a 5\u20136 record (3\u20135 in Pac-10, seventh), and outscored their opponents 271 to 248. The team's statistical leaders included Mike Pattinson with 1,430 passing yards, Kevin Hicks with 497 rushing yards, and Deron Pointer with 996 receiving yards. Starting quarterback Pattinson, a fifth-year senior from nearby Moscow, suffered a broken collarbone at homecoming against #21 California in mid- October and was lost for the season. Shawn Deeds came off the bench to lead the WSU to a decisive victory and a #25 ranking at 5\u20132, but the Cougars lost the next four games with Chad DeGrenier and Deeds at quarterback. ==Schedule== ==Roster== : ==NFL Draft== For the first time in three years, no Cougars were selected in the 1994 NFL Draft; four were selected the following year. * List of Washington State Cougars in the NFL Draft ==References== Washington State Category:Washington State Cougars football seasons Category:1993 in sports in Washington (state) ",
