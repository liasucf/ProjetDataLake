    "text": "The Puketiro Wind Farm was a renewable energy project being developed on Puketiro Forest land owned by the council near Pauatahanui, north of Wellington, New Zealand. After a tender process in 2006, RES NZ Ltd was selected to develop the project. However, the project did not subsequently proceed. It was planned for approximately 40 wind turbines with a capacity of up to 130 MW. Wide public consultation was undertaken during early development of the project. 1300 submissions were received, with over 90% in favour. Nonetheless, a group of residents (Pauatahanui Futures Society Inc.) sought an injunction in May 2008 to stop the wind farm from proceeding. The Greater Wellington Regional Council has since withdrawn permission for the three turbines that were to be installed in Battle Hill Farm Forest Park, and banned all turbines from the park.
