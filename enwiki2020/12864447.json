    "text": "Calathea veitchiana is a species of plant in the Marantaceae family. It is endemic to Ecuador. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. The plant was discovered near Cuenca by the Victorian plant collector, Richard Pearce in 1862, and named in honour of his employers, James Veitch & Sons. ==Similar species== In 1983 a new species of Calathea was described from Peru, that, although not closely related to C. veitchiana, shows the same leaf pattern and had been previously misidentified in collections as C. veitchiana. This new species was named C. pseudoveitchiana. ==References== veitchiana Category:Endemic flora of Ecuador Category:Veitch Nurseries Category:Near threatened plants Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
