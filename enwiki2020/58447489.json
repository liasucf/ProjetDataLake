Initial reports from Iranian news agencies listed 11 killed people. Later reports indicated 18 people were killed. ==Background== In the months preceding the attack, some attacks were carried out by Iraqi Kurdish rebels on the borders of the Islamic Republic of Iran in order to carry out acts of sabotage in the provinces such as West Azerbaijan Province, Kermanshah and Kurdistan. Therefore, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps fought against them at the Kamyaran border the previous week. According to the IRGC, the target of the missile strike wss described as intending to bring to an end to \"terrorist and aggressive actions against Iran\". The attack took place after ignoring serious warnings by officials of the Kurdistan Regional Government about Iran\u2019s determination to dismantle their bases. ==Casualties== According to initial reports the missile strike led to the death of 12 people and 50 others injured, party officials stated. Later reporting indicated the death toll had risen to 18, six of whom were members of the central committee of KDP-Iran. Rahman Piroti was among them. Also, leaders of DPIK, Mustafa Mouloudi and Khalid Azizi were wounded. ==Reaction== On 15 September 2018, the rebel group tried to attack Iran embassy in France. They burned Iran's flag in front of the embassy and broke the windows with stones. The Rebel group was identified as Kurdish activists, according to Reuters. On 17 September 2018, 10 members of the anarchist group Rouvikonas riding motorbikes hurled bottles of paint at the outer walls of the Iranian Embassy in Athens. ==See also== *2018 Marivan border crossing attack *2018 attack on the Iranian Embassy in France *2017 Deir ez-Zor missile strike == References == Category:2018 in military history Category:2018 in Iraqi Kurdistan Category:Military operations involving Iran ",
