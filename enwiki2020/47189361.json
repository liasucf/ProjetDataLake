It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. ==History== Peter Dierks, Sr. immigrated from Schleswig-Holstein (Germany) to the United States in 1848.

He rented a farm until he could afford to buy of his own land. He lived in a frame dwelling until he built this house in 1865 where he raised his family. He was engaged in general farming until he cleared more land and started a livestock operation. Dierks' became prosperous as he sold off some of his property to other settlers. He died in 1897 and his son, Peter Dierks, Jr., took over the farm and raised his ten children in the house. He added the wood-frame kitchen, with a Queen Anne style porch and pantry wing in 1899. Peter Jr. lost the house during the Great Depression in 1931 to Preston Creveling and his family. A bathroom was added into the house only in 1970. The Creveling family owned the house for almost 60 years when they sold it to Leif and Barbara Solheim in 1990. They sold it to Arlene Rose Considine in March 1996. ==Architecture== The Dierks-Creveling House is a two-story dwelling of native yellow limestone that was built on a stone foundation.
