The best known member of the family is Stephen P. Mugar, (1901-1982), who founded the Star Market chain of super markets on which the family fortune was based. In its May, 2004, issue, Boston Magazine ranked the Mugar family sixth in its list of the 50 most influential Boston families.\"The Fifty Families (Part 1)\", Boston Magazine, November 2006 (archived 2012) ==Family origin== The first family members to arrive in Boston were brothers, Charles and Martin Mugar (shortened from Mugardichian), who came from Kharpert, Ottoman Empire, in 1904. They were joined in 1906 by their brothers, Arthur, Gregory and Sarkis Mugar, along with Sarkis Mugar's wife and three children, one of whom was Stephen P. Mugar. ==Prominent family members== *Stephen P. Mugar, (1901-1982) founder of the Star Market chain *John M.
