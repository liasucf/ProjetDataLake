Voters chose eight representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Louisiana voted for the Republican candidate, Ulysses S. Grant, over Liberal Republican candidate Horace Greeley. Grant won Louisiana by a margin of 11.38%. However, due to the turbulent conditions of Reconstruction, along with various irregularities and allegations of electoral fraud, Congress rejected Louisiana's eight electoral votes. Neighboring Arkansas's electoral votes were also rejected. ==Results== ==References== Louisiana 1872 Category:1872 Louisiana elections ",
