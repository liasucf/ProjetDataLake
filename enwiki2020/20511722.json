The title of the song P.C.P. is an acronym for Probl\u00e8me de Consommation Personnelle meaning personal consumption problem related to drug use and features Uncle Costa and Shantal Arroyo on lead vocals. A video was made for No Sympathy. The songs Lord Ogre and Fat Al's Illness are rerecorded versions from the Fatal Illness days, the latter being a wordplay on the band's early name. == Track listing == #Ouverture In E Minor #Rigpa #East Coast #No Sympathy #Self Inflicted Stress #Le gouvernement songe #La vache #Lord Ogre #Dead End Violence #Dope Vibe Moon #Feeling Severe #Brussels 109 #P.C.P. #Colorblind #Inner Piece #Fat Al's Illness == References == Bande \u00e0 part profile Video of No Sympathy Category:GrimSkunk albums Category:1996 albums Category:Indica Records albums ",
