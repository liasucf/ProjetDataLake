    "text": "\"Bills\" is the debut single by American rapper LunchMoney Lewis. The song was released on February 5, 2015 by Kemosabe Records. The song topped the charts in Australia and peaked within the top ten of the charts in Belgium (Flanders), New Zealand, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. The extended play was released in April. ==Background and composition== Lewis discussed the song's conception: \"Ricky (Reed) played the beat and that just started the idea. I sang 'I got bills' and he just popped up off his chair. It was like a chain reaction. Ricky doesn't really get excited about much. I don't either because we write so much, so it's hard to gauge but there was a good feeling. We were writing about things people can relate to, which is fun. It's all truthful.\" Described as a novelty song, \"Bills\" features \"elements of hip-hop and soul, with a ragtag, jazz sound\". The song has a tempo of 126 beats per minute, and is in the key of F major. ==Music video== A music video to accompany the release of \"Bills\" was first released onto YouTube on February 20, 2015. The video is directed by Emil Nava.Video: ==Track listing== ===EP=== ==Credits and personnel== Credits from ASCAP. * Eric Frederic \u2013 composer * Rickard G\u00f6ransson \u2013 composer * Jacob Kasher \u2013 composer * Gamal Lewis \u2013 composer * Ricky Reed \u2013 producer, programmer, recording engineer * Drew Kapner \u2013 recording engineer * Kyle Mann \u2013 recording engineer * Alex Gruszecki \u2013 assistant engineer * John Hanes \u2013 mixing engineer * Serban Ghenea \u2013 mixing engineer * Chris Gehringer \u2013 mastering engineer ==Charts and certifications== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !
