Like other princely houses of Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, its origins are considered murky. Present historical opinion holds in favour of their descent from Algirdas' grandson Alexander (fl. 1433\u20131443), lord of Kovel and Liuboml, whose name can be shortened to Sangush. The family supposedly descends from two lines, associated with two of his sons, Alexander and Michael. The senior line, called the Sanguszko-Koszyrski, has been extinct since the death of Adam Aleksander Sanguszko in 1653. The junior line, or the Sanguszko-Kowelski, of Szymon Samuel Sanguszko, subsequently assumed the title Sanguszko-Lubartowicz, according to the erroneous assumption of their descent from Algirdas' younger brother Liubartas. Prince Pawe\u0142 Karol Sanguszko-Lubartowicz (1682\u20131752), a Court and Grand Marshal of Lithuania, greatly expanded his holdings through his second marriage with Marianna Lubomirska, heiress of Ostroh. His chief residence at Iziaslav (now in Ukraine) was embellished with a famous collection of Persian carpets, known as Sanguszko carpets. Hieronymous Sanguszko (1743\u20131812) founded the Volhynia stud, establishing the family as breeders of Arabian horses. After the partitions of Poland, Eustachy Erazm Sanguszko fought in the Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising and Napoleon's Russian campaign. His son, Prince Roman Sanguszko, was a Polish officer who participated in the November Uprising, and was exiled to Siberia. His life is the subject of \"Prince Roman\" (1910) one of Joseph Conrad's short stories. With the incorporation of Galicia into Soviet Ukraine after World War II, the Sanguszkos lost their Gumniska and S\u0142awuta estates, as well as their palace in Lviv, and emigrated to Brazil. By the late 20th century, the family was represented by a single descendant, Prince Paul (born 1973), who resides in S\u00e3o Paulo. His mother came from the Polignac lineage. In 2010 Olympia Sanguszko was born to Prince Paul and his wife. ==Lineages== * \"koszyrsko- niesuchoi\u017cska\" (Kamie\u0144 Koszyrski-Niesuchoje\u017ce line) \u2013 split into two primary lineages: ** \"ga\u0142\u0105\u017a koszyrska\" \u2013 \"Sanguszkowie-Koszyrscy\" (Kamie\u0144 Koszyrski branch) \u2013 the branch died out in 1653 ** \"ga\u0142\u0105\u017a niesuchoi\u017cska\" \u2013 \"Sanguszkowie-Niesuchoi\u017cscy\" (Niesuchoje\u017ce branch) \u2013 the branch died out in 1591 * \"linia kowelska\" \u2013 \"Sanguszkowie-Kowelscy\" (Kowel line) \u2013 existing until today == Notable members == === Generation 0 === * Alexander Feodorovich (died c. 1454), progenitor of the Sanguszko family === Generation 1 === * Aleksander Sanguszkowic (died c. 1491), progenitor of the Sanguszko Kamie\u0144 Koszyrski-Niesuchoje\u017ce line * Micha\u0142 Sanguszkowic (died c. 1511), progenitor of the Sanguszko Kowel line * Ivan Sanguszkowic, progenitor of the Sadovski family === Generation 2 === * Micha\u0142 (died c. 1501) * Andrzej Aleksandrowicz Sanguszko (died c. 1534/5), starost of W\u0142odzimierz * Wasyl Sanguszko (died c. 1557), courtier === Generation 3 === * Andrzej Micha\u0142owicz Sanguszko (died 1560), marsza\u0142ek hospodarski * Fiodor Sanguszko (died 1547/8) starost of W\u0142odzimierz, Brac\u0142aw and Winnica * Herhory (died 1555) === Generation 4 === * Aleksander Sanguszko (c. 1508\u20131565), marsza\u0142ek hospodarski * Dymitr Sanguszko * Roman Sanguszko (c. 1537\u20131571), voivode of Brac\u0142aw, Field Hetman of Lithuania * Andrzej Sanguszko (died. 1591) === Generation 5 === * Lew Sanguszko (c. 1536\u20131571), rotmistrz of Lithuanian cavalry * Lew-Roman Sanguszko (died. 1591), the last member of the Sanguszko Niesuchoje\u017ce branch * Samuel Szymon Sanguszko (died 1638) voivode of Witebsk, writer, he converted to Catholicism === Generation 6 === * Hrehory Sanguszko (died 1602), castelan of Lubacz\u00f3w and Brac\u0142aw * Hieronim W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sanguszko (1611\u20131657), bishop of Smole\u0144sk * Jan W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sanguszko (died 1652) === Generation 7 === * Adam Aleksander Sanguszko (c. 1590\u20131653), voivode of Wo\u0142y\u0144, the last member of the Sanguszko Kamie\u0144 Koszyrski branch * Hieronim (1651\u20131684) === Generation 8 === * Kazimierz Antoni Sanguszko (1677\u20131706), Court Marshal of Lithuania * Anna Katarzyna Radziwi\u0142\u0142owa (1676\u20131746) * Pawe\u0142 Karol Sanguszko (1680\u20131750), Court Marshal of Lithuania, Grand Marshal of Lithuania * Barbara Urszula Sanguszkowa (1718\u20131791), poet, translator, philanthropist, wife of Pawe\u0142 Karol === Generation 9 === * Janusz Aleksander Sanguszko (1712\u20131775), miecznik, Court Marshal of Lithuania * J\u00f3zef Paulin Sanguszko (1740\u20131781), Grand Marshal of Lithuania * Hieronim Janusz Sanguszko (1743\u20131812), general, voivode of Wo\u0142y\u0144 * Janusz Modest Sanguszko (1749\u20131806), starost of Krzemieniec === Generation 10 === * Tekla Teresa Lubienska (1767-1810), granddaughter of Barbara Urszula, playwright, poet and translator * Eustachy Erazm Sanguszko (1768\u20131844), general, deputy, horse breeder * Klementyna Maria Sanguszkowa (1780\u20131852), philanthropist === Generation 11 === * Roman Stanis\u0142aw Sanguszko (1800\u20131881), participated in the November Uprising in 1830, exiled to Siberia, subject of \"Prince Roman\" (1910) one of Joseph Conrad's short stories. * W\u0142adys\u0142aw Hieronim Sanguszko (1803\u20131870), conservative politician * Dorota Sanguszko (1799\u20131821) === Generation 12 === * Jadwiga Sanguszko (1830\u20131918), wife of Adam Stanis\u0142aw Sapieha, mother of cardinal Adam Stefan Sapieha * Roman Damian Sanguszko (1832\u20131917), ordynat of Zas\u0142aw, collector * Pawe\u0142 Roman Sanguszko (1834\u20131876), landlord * Eustachy Stanis\u0142aw Sanguszko (1842\u20131903) marshal, namiestnik of Galicia * Helena Sanguszko (1836\u20131891) === Generation 13 === * Roman W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sanguszko (1901\u20131984), landlord, horse breeder, industrialist, philanthropist === Generation 14 === * Piotr Antoni Samuel Sanguszko (1937\u20131989) === Generation 15 === * Pawe\u0142 Franciszek Roman Sanguszko (born 1973), the last living member of the Sanguszko family == Palaces == image:Lubart\u00f3 -
