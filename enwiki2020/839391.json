    "text": "Robson Arms is a Canadian television series that began airing on CTV on June 17, 2005 and ended on June 30, 2008. Robson Arms is a co-production between Vancouver-based Omni Film Productions Limited and Halifax's Creative Atlantic Communications. The show is a comedy-drama (dramedy) anthology organized around the Robson Arms, an apartment building in Vancouver, at the fictional address of 951 Pendrell Street. Each of the show's episodes focuses principally on a different tenant of the building, although the core cast members interact in minor roles throughout the series. In each episode, the Troubadours comment on the storyline through song. The show was created to fulfill a licensing requirement of CTV's Vancouver station, CIVT, which originally promised, as an independent station, to produce 20 episodes of an anthology series entitled The Storytellers. Only ten such episodes were produced. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) did not agree that CIVT's new network programming supplanted this commitment and asked the station to fulfill its promise.Decision CRTC 2001-457-13 at 10 CTV believed the anthology would be more successful as a series with common characters, and Robson Arms was the result. Two of the show's regular cast members, Gabrielle Miller and Fred Ewanuick, appeared in this series concurrent with their continuing roles in another CTV production, Corner Gas. The series currently airs in reruns on CTV's secondary CTV Two system. == Cast and characters == The season(s) during which each actor has been included in the main cast are marked in black.
