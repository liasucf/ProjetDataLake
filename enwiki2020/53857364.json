    "text": "Fuling Catholic Church is a Catholic church located in Fuling, China. In the West, it's best known for the description given by Peter Hessler in his book River Town: Two Years on the Yangtze (2001). ==History== The church was founded in 1861 by French missionaries. The church also had two French priests until the Communist Revolution;Hessler 2001 p. 221 According to written sources, the church was converted into a sock factory by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.Hessler 2001 p. 223. The priest and the neighborhood, instead, assert that the church itself was just closed down and the sock factory was started in the buildings in front of the church. In 1981 the church reopened and on the first Sunday less than twenty nervous people went to Mass.Hessler 2001 p. 225. The church was renovated in 1991, as stated on the plaque next to the entrance of the church. ==The neighborhood== Fuling Catholic Church is located in Fuling historical city center. This area will be heavily renewed in 2017. Many buildings, except the very old ones, will be torn down. After consultation with the government, it has been agreed that the church will not be torn down and rebuilt in Lidu (\u674e\u6e21\u9547) neighborhood. == Gallery == File:FCC_courtyard_entrance.jpg|The entrance to the courtyard - 2017 File:FCC_church_entrance.jpg|The entrance to the church - 2017 File:FCC_entrance_plaque.jpg|The plaque next to the church entrance - 2017 File:FCC_church_interior.jpg|The interior of the church - 2017 File:FCC_courtyard.jpg|The courtyard - 2017 File:FCC_priests_office.jpg|The priest's office - 2017 File:FCC_Virgin_Mary_chapel.jpg|Virgin Mary chapel - 2017 File:FCC_Virgin_Mary.jpg|Virgin Mary - 2017 ==References== ==Bibliography== Books * Category:Roman Catholic churches in China ",
