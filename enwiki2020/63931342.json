His local venues included the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists, the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool and the Royal Academy. While in England, he continued to travel; visiting France, the Low Countries, Italy and Morocco, which inspired his first Orientalist works. His marriage to Agnes ended in the late 1880s, and their four children went with her, but he met another Englishwoman, the well-to-do Maude Chadwick, during a trip to North Africa, and they were married in 1892.
