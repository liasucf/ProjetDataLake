An example of a strong selector is an email address. In other words, it would be a database of the metadata associated with names, phone numbers, email addresses, and other identifying information that intelligence services are specifically targeting. Journalist Marc Ambinder speculates the program is a \"raw SIGINT viewer for data analysis.\" File:KS10-001.jpg|A reference to TRAFFICTHIEF in an XKeyscore slide == References == Category:National Security Agency Category:Espionage projects ",
