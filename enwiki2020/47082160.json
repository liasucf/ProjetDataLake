Midland Railway Workshops built nine AYE trailer cars on the second hand underframes that were operated between two ADGs to operate as three car sets. These were replaced by ADAs in 1962. In 1963/64, the ADGs were fitted with superchargers and between 1969 and 1973 with Voith transmissions. In the mid-1980s, some were fitted with larger AEC 11.3 litre engines from withdrawn ADX railcars while others received new Mercedes-Benz engines. Most lasted until 1992 when replaced by electric trains. Two have been preserved by the Hotham Valley Railway and one by Rail Heritage WA. ==References== Category:Diesel multiple units of Western Australia Category:Train-related introductions in 1954 ",
