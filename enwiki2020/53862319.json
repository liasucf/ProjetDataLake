Launched in 1988, it was the thirteenth of fifteen Intelsat V satellites to be launched. The Intelsat V series was constructed by Ford Aerospace, based on the Intelsat VA satellite bus. Intelsat VA F-13 was part of an advanced series of satellites designed to provide greater telecommunications capacity for Intelsat's global network. == Satellite == The satellite was box-shaped, measuring 1.66 by 2.1 by 1.77 metres; solar arrays spanned 15.9 metres tip to tip. The arrays, supplemented by nickel-hydrogen batteries during eclipse, provided 1800 watts of power at mission onset, approximately 1280 watts at the end of its seven-year design life. The payload housed 26 C-band and 6 Ku-band transponders. It could accommodate 15,000 two- way voice circuits and two TV channels simultaneously. It also provided maritime communications for ships at sea. == Launch == The satellite was successfully launched into space on 17 May 1988, at 23:58:00 UTC, by means of an Ariane 2 vehicle from the Centre Spatial Guyanais, Kourou, French Guiana. It had a launch mass of 1981 kg. The Intelsat VA F-13 was equipped with 6 Ku- band transponders more 26 C-band transponders for 15,000 audio circuits and two TV channels. == NSS-513 == Intelsat 513 was sold to New Satellite Skies on 30 November 1998, and renamed NSS-513. The satellite was deactivated on August 2003. == References == Category:Spacecraft launched in 1988 Category:Intelsat satellites Category:SES satellites ",
