    "text": "Euonymus phellomanus is a species of flowering plant in the family Celastraceae, native to China. It is one of several species within Euonymus called spindle or spindle tree. A substantial deciduous shrub growing to tall by broad, it produces insignificant yellow-green flowers in May followed by brilliant pink fruits in autumn. The fruits sometimes break open to reveal bright orange seeds. A notable feature is the rough corky bark which with age develops \u201cwings\u201d clothing the length of each branch. A similar effect is seen in the related Euonymus alata. This feature gives rise to a name occasionally used, the corktree (or cork tree). In cultivation this hardy plant is very adaptable, accepting moist or dry soil in full or partial sunshine. In the UK it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society\u2019s Award of Garden Merit. ==References== phellomanus ",
