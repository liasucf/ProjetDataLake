She was also the dam of three sires who had a great influence on the breed. ==Breeding== Crucifix was a bay filly foaled in 1837, by The Derby winner, Priam; her dam was the then 21-year-old, Octaviana by Octavian.Leicester, Sir Charles, Bloodstock Breeding, J.A. Allen & Co, London, 1969 Her breeder was George Stanhope, 6th Earl of Chesterfield. Crucifix was a sister to Chesterfield, who sired the stakes-winner, The Hero. Her sire, Priam, also sired The Oaks winners Miss Letty and Industry before he was sold for 3,500 guineas and exported in 1837 to Virginia in the United States.Morris, Simon; Tesio Power 2000 - Stallions of the World, Syntax Software The powerful racing figure, Lord George Bentinck, bought Crucifix as a foal at foot with her 22-year-old dam for 65 guineas. At maturity, Crucifix stood nearly 16 hands high, with her body being described as \"wiry\", and she possessed a temperamental disposition.Ahnert, Rainer L. (editor in chief), Thoroughbred Breeding of the World, Pozdun Publishing, Germany, 1970 ==Racing record== ===At two years: 1839=== Crucifix had nine starts for wins in the Chesterfield Stakes (carrying top weight), Lavant Stakes, July Stakes and Molecombe Stakes, the Hopeful Stakes at Newmarket, the Clearwell Stakes, the Prendergast Stakes, and a walk-over in a sweepstakes at Newmarket; in the ninth race, the Criterion Stakes she dead-heated with Gibraltar. Her prize money for that season was a record \u00a34,587. ===At three years: 1840=== In her three starts as a three-year-old Crucifix won the Two Thousand Guineas, One Thousand Guineas and Epsom Oaks. The false starts resorted to at the start of the Oaks lasted about an hour and it took about 15 attempts to get the 15 runners started. As a result of these tactics to defeat favourites, Lord George introduced reforms to inhibit this practice.Kent, John, Racing life of Lord George Cavendish Bentinck, M.P. and other reminiscences, W. Blackwood, Edinburgh,1892 Welfare ran second to Crucifix and she too, was by Priam. After the running of the Oaks Crucifix pulled up lame, and was retired with earnings of \u00a310,287. Crucifix became shortest odds winner of the 1,000 Guineas when she was 1/10 odds on. She was also the first of only four horses to ever win both the 1,000 Guineas and the 2,000 Guineas in the same year, when the two races were run two days apart. In her dead-heat in the Criterion Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse and her win in the Oaks Stakes at Epsom, Crucifix defeated the good mare Pocahontas and others on each occasion.1,000 Guineas Records Retrieved 2010-4-14 ==Stud record== Crucifix was the dam of: * 1842 colt, Cowl by Bay Middleton, sire * 1844 b colt, Crozier by Lancercost * 1845 b colt, Surplice by Touchstone, won Epsom Derby and St. Leger Stakes, sire of Florin, (won Poule d'Essai des Poulains) and others, and broodmare sire of Queen Bertha * 1846 Cucullus by Bay Middleton, died * 1847 colt, Pontifex by Touchstone * 1849 filly, Rosary by Touchstone * 1850 b colt, Constantine, by Cotherstone * 1851 b colt, Cardinal, by Touchstone * 1852 filly, Chalice by Orlando, won Royal Hunt Cup, second dam of Placida (Epsom Oaks)Thoroughbred Bloodlines: Crucifix Retrieved 2010-3-31 In order to pursue his political career Lord Bentinck sold his entire racing interests, including at least 60 horses along with Crucifix and her son, and future Epsom Derby winner, Surplice, for \u00a310,000 to Edward Lloyd-Mostyn, 2nd Baron Mostyn.Montgomery, E.S, \u201cThe Thoroughbred\u201d, Arco, New York, 1973 Crucifix was later sold to Henry Agar- Ellis, 3rd Viscount Clifden.Thoroughbred Heritage: Priam Retrieved 24 April 2010 Ajax, the undefeated French Derby winner and sire, great broodmare Double Life (dam of Precipitation and Persian Gulf), and many other good horses descend from Crucifix in the distaff line.
