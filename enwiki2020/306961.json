    "text": "The Yakama are a Native American tribe with nearly 10,851 members, based primarily in eastern Washington state. Yakama people today are enrolled in the federally recognized tribe, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation. Their Yakama Indian Reservation, along the Yakima River, covers an area of approximately 1.2 million acres (5,260 km\u00b2). Today the nation is governed by the Yakama Tribal Council, which consists of representatives of 14 tribes. Many Yakama people engage in ceremonial, subsistence, and commercial fishing for salmon, steelhead, and sturgeon in the Columbia River and its tributaries, including within land ceded by the tribe to the United States. Their right to fish in their former territory is protected by treaties and was re-affirmed in late 20th-century court cases such as United States v. Washington (known as the Boldt Decision, 1974) and United States v. Oregon (Sohappy v. Smith, 1969). ==Etymology== Scholars disagree on the origins of the name Yakama. The Sahaptin words, E-yak-ma, means \"a growing family\", and iyakima, means \"pregnant ones\". Other scholars note the word, y\u00e1kama, which means \"black bear,\" or ya-ki-n\u00e1, which means \"runaway\".\"Yakama,\" U*X*L Encyclopedia of Native American Tribes, U*X*L. 2008. Retrieved August 14, 2012 from HighBeam Research They have also been referred to as the Waptailnsim, \"people of the narrow river,\" and Pa'kiut'l\u0115ma, \"people of the gap,\" which describes the tribe's location along the Yakima River. The Yakama identify as the Mamachatpam. == Historic Yakama Band and Territories == \u2033Yakima\u2033 or \u2033Yakama\u2033 was first a collective term for five (originally six) regional bands who spoke the same language or dialect of Sahaptin, also known as Ichishk\u00edin S\u0268\u0301nwit (\u2033this language\u2033). Usually they named the individual bands, village groups, local groups, and rivers after a specific rock formation, their main camps, or after an important village or fishing site. The English names of the following local rivers were derived from Sahaptin: the Klickitat, Umatilla, Walla Walla, Palouse, Yakima, Satus, Toppenish, Tieton, and Wenatchee (in each case the original native term referred not to the river itself, which generally was left unnamed):Sahaptin placenames \u2013 Columbia Plateau Indian Place Names: What Can They Teach Us? * Yakama (proper) or Lower Yakama (in Yakama: M\u00e1machatpam) \u2013 Chief Kamiakin's people: Their territory encompasses the watershed of the Lower Yakima River east of the Cascade Range, hence they were called Lower Yakima to distinguish them from their upriver cousins \u2013 the \u2033Kittitas or Upper Yakama.\u2033 As they were the largest group in population, they were often termed as Yakama or Yakama proper. Their lands stretched from Selah (\u2033Quiet Water\u2033) and Wenas just north of today's Yakima south to the area around today's Prosser (named for the nearby Prosser Falls as Tapteil, Tap tut, Toptut \u2013 \u2033rapids or falls\u2033). All major rivers in this area \u2013 such as the Naches River, and Ahtanum, Toppenish and Satus reeks \u2013 are tributaries of the Yakima River. ** S\u00edla-\u0127lama (along the Yakima River between Wenas and Umtanum creeks, the northernmost Lower Yakama Band) ** W\u00ednas-\u0127lama (along Wenas Creek, the \u2033cross river\u2033 between the Upper Yakama and Lower Yakama) ** Nahch\u00edsh-\u0127lama (\u2033People along the Roaring Water, i.e. Naches River\u2033), lived along the Tieton and Naches rivers (the latter meaning \u2033roaring, rough or turbulent water\u2033), the largest tributary of the Yakima River. They were closely linked to the Taitnapam (\u2033People of the Tieton River\u2033) regional band west of the Cascade Range) ** Tka\u00edwaicha\u015b-\u0127lama / Tkai'waichash-hlama (along Cowiche Creek near the eastern foothills of the Cascade Mountain range) ** \u00c1tan\u016dm-\u0127lama (\u2033People along Ahtanum Creek\u2033, named after their territory along Ahtanum Creek, a right tributary to the Yakima River, entering the Yakima River immediately upstream of Ahtanum Ridge anticline (Union Gap), their main village Pa'kiut / P\u00e1xutakyuu-t (\"both hills together or gap\", \"heads joined\") in the valley between Ahtanum Ridge and Rattlesnake Ridge was the most important of the Lower Yakama; hence the self-designation of this particular local or village group as Pa'kiut'-\u0127lama / Pa'kiut'l\u0115ma (\u2033People of the gap\u2033, lit. \u2033People of Mountain Heads Coming Together\u2033) was transferred by the Europeans as Pah-quy- ti-koot-lema /Pakiutlema or as Narrow River Indians to all Lower Yakama bands and later to neighboring Yakama bands to) ** P\u00edsko-\u0127lama / Pisko-pum (\u2033Sagebrush People\u2033, along Toppenish Creek of the Toppenish plains, a right tributary of the Yakima River) ** S\u00ed-\u0127lama (on Yakima River above the mouth of Toppenish Creek) ** first Th\u00e1pn\u012d\u015b-\u0127lama / Thap-pah-nish (also on Toppenish Creek \u2013 Toppenish Creek was named after T\u1e8b\u00e1pni\u0161 / Tx\u00e1pni-sh (\u2033that which suddenly goes forth\u2033 or \u2033protruded, stuck out\u2033, an allusion to a large landslide that occurred on the ridge south of White Swan, Washington \u2013 the contemporary Yakima Indian Reservation town of Toppenish is a corruption of this native term); this self-designation was transferred by the Europeans as Toppenish to refer to all Lower Yakama and neighboring Yakama bands) ** second Th\u00e1pn\u012d\u015b-\u0127lama / Thap-pah-nish (on Toppenish Creek north of the Simcoe Mountains (in Yakama: Sim Quwe \u2013 \"saddle back\" or \u2033a dip between two hills like a saddle back\u2033) ** S\u00edmkoe-\u0127lama (along Simcoe Creek in the Simcoe Valley, later there was established Fort Simcoe, this area, originally known as \"Mool- mool\", had been a camp site for the summer and early fall seasons) ** Se'tas- \u0127lama / Setass-lema (on Satus Creek) ** Taptat-\u0127lama (\u2033People at the rapids, i.e. Prosser Falls\u2033, along Yakima River from the mouth of Satus Creek to present Kiona, with a key fishery at Prosser Falls (today: Prosser, in Yakama: Tapteil, Tap tut, Toptut \u2013 \u2033rapids, waterfalls\u2033; this self-designation was also transferred by the Europeans as Tap-teil-lema / Tap-teil-min or its proper variant Waptail-lema / Waptailmim to all Lower Yakama and neighboring Yakama bands) * Upper Yakama or Kittitas (meaning of the word Kittitas vary \u2013 perhaps \u2033shale rock, white chalk, or white clay \u2033, but in any case the name probably refers to the region's soil composition)Another interpretation is that the bread made from the root kous was called kit-tit.

They occupied the northern Yakima River tributaries Cle Elum River (in Yakama: Tie-el-Lum \u2013 \"swift water\"), Teanaway River (in Yakama: Tyawnaw\u00ed-ins \u2013 \"[salmon] drying place\"), Kachess River to the Wenatchee Mountains and Saddle Mountains in the east. Their territory included three large lakes in the Cascade Range (from east to west): Cle Elum Lake, Kachess Lake (\"more fish\") and Keechelus Lake (\"few fish\"). * Klikatat / Klickitat (a corruption of the place name l\u00e1taxat for a key fishery at the falls of the Klickitat River or l\u00e1daxat, an Upper Chinook name for a Klickitat village with resident Kiksht-speaking Wishram,another version for the origin of the tribal name Klickitat is probably a Chinookan word meaning \"beyond\" in reference to the Rocky Mountains in Yakama: Xw\u00e1l\u03c7waypam / Qw\u00fb'lh-hwai-p\u00fbm / X\u0323\u02b7\u00e1\u026cx\u0323\u02b7aypam \u2013 \u2033Prairie People\u2033 or \u2033People of the village \u03c7w\u00e1l\u03c7way (Steller's Jay')\u2033, located at the junction of the Klickitat and Little Klickitat Rivers) \u2013 Chief Slockish's people: Their territory was generally situated north of the Columbia River, at the headwaters of the Cowlitz, Lewis, Washougal, White Salmon, and Klickitat rivers. * Cowlitz Klickitat or Lewis River Klickitat Band, erroneously called Upper Cowlitz or Lewis River Cowlitz, sometimes Lewis River Chinook (in Yakama: Taitnapam / Taidnapam / T\u00e1itinpam \u2013 \u2033People of the Tieton River\u2033): Closely allied with their Yakama kin (\u00c1ypa\u03c7-pam \u2013 \u2033People of the Plains\u2033 or \u2033People of the river mouth\u2033) east of the Cascades \u2013 they had permanently occupied and controlled the Upper Cowlitz (shch'il) above Mossyrock, Cispus River (sh\u00edshpash), Tilton River (lal\u00e1lx), the uppermost Nisqually River and Lewis River basins. They apparently intermarried with Salish-speaking Lower Cowlitz (in Yakama: T'lkwi'lipam / \u03bb'kw\u00edlipam) communities downriver and travelled freely as far as the mouth of the Cowlitz River (in Yakama: shchil-ayp\u00e1\u03c7 \u2013 \u2033Cowlitz River mouth\u2033), as well as moving freely through adjacent Yakama-controlled territory east of the Cascade Crest. Their own name Taitnapam indicates that they originally came from east oft the Cascades \u2013 along the Tieton River (in Yakama: T\u00e1itin) hence territory of the Nahch\u00edsh-\u0127lama, a Yakama/Lower Yakama band along the Naches River; they had strong linguistic and family ties to that band and to the Klikatat / Klickitat. ** Qw':lt\u026ba'ma / Qwiilt-l\u00e1-ma (occupied the Mossyrock Prairie near Mossyrock on the east end of the Klickitat Prairie along Upper Cowlitz River) ** Lalalx\u026ba'ma / Lalalx-l\u00e1-ma (their main settlement lal\u00e1lx was at the mouth of the Tilton River, which was also called lal\u00e1lx ) ** Wasa\u026ba'ma (lived around Morton at the foothills of the Cascade Mountains in the Tilton River Valley southwest of Mount Rainier) ** Nucnu:\u026ba'ma (lived in Cowlitz River Canyon) ** Sw:ktsw'kt\u026ba'ma / Swikt-swikt-l\u00e1-ma (lived around today Nesika, Washington, on Riffe Lake, south of Morton and upriver of Mossyrock, and in Steel Canyon, Winters Mountain and Green Mountain) ** K'wp\u026ba'ma (lived at the Cowlitz Falls of Cowlitz River, which was a key fishery site) ** Cicpac\u026ba'ma (lived along Cispus River) ** Qiyanxu\u026ba'ma / Q'iyanxw-l\u00e1-ma (lived along Cowlitz River, ca. 7 miles west of Kiona, Washington) ** Ca'q'k\u026ba'ma / Sh\u00edq'k-l\u00e1-ma (lived along Kiona Creek, a tributary of the Cowlitz River) * Wanapum / W\u00e1napam (\u2033River People\u2033): They lived south of the Saddle Mountains on both sides of the Columbia River downriver to the mouth of the Snake River, most important settlement as well as fishing grounds was at Priest Rapids, 1953 the construction of the Priest Rapids Dam and the Wanapum Dam flooded the W\u00e1napam living and fishing grounds to create the Priest Rapids Lake reservoir. Today still about 60 W\u00e1napam are living near today's Priest Rapids Dams. The Wanapam dreamer-prophet Smohalla (\u2033Dreamer\u2033 or \u2033Preacher\u2033) was the most prominent leader of the Washane (\"Dreamer Religion\"), other prophets were Chief Homli (of the Walla Walla), Kotiakan (of the Pa'kiut'-\u0127lama local group of Lower Yakama) as well Lishwailait and Ashnithlai (both Klickitat). Adherents included Chief Joseph and his Nez Perc\u00e9 followers as well as Native people from other tribes in the region. * Mishalpam (in Yakama: Mical-\u026ba'ma \u2013 \u2033Eatonville people\u2033, lit. \u2033Mashel River people\u2033), later called Upper (Mountain) Nisqually, today also commonly known as Meshal / Me-Schal / Mashel / Mica'l Band of Nisqually \u2013 Chief Leschi's people: Their territory was generally on the west side of the Cascade Range and northwest of the kindred Klikatat / Klickitat and encompassed the Mashel River, tributary of the Nisqually, and the Upper Nisqually and Upper Puyallup River Valleys reaching up to Mount Rainier (Talol/Tacoma/Tahoma) (\"bigger than Mount Baker\") \u2013 together with Klikatat / Klickitat they occupied Ohop Valley in Pierce County (around present-day cities Eatonville and Roy); their primary village site was Basha'labsh on Meshal River, near present-day La Grande, Washington. They intermarried with downstream and closer to the coast living Southern Lushootseed-speaking Nisqually (Squalli-Absh / Sq\u02b7ali\u02bcab\u0161) (\"People of the Grassland\"), a Coast Salish people, had switched from Sahaptin to Nisqually / Sq\u02b7ali'ab\u0161 no later than in the 19th century. Chief Leschi (from Basha'labsh, with a Yakama mother) was one of the most important leaders during the Puget Sound War (1855 und 1856) of an intertribal alliance of Coast Salish (Nisqually, Puyallup (S'Puyalupubsh) and Muckleshoot) and Sahaptin (Mishalpam, Klikatat / Klickitat and Yakama) peoples. Their lands lay within the Yakima Rivers (in Yakama: Tapteal \u2013 \u2033rapids\u2033 because of the waterfalls at Prosser, Washington) watershed and for the most part east of the Cascade Range, to the south along the northern tributaries of the Columbia River (in Yakama: Nch'i-W\u00e1na \u2013 \u2033great river\u2033) (here the Yakama bands frequently lived in bilingual villages together with Southern/Columbia River Sahaptin-speaking bands: Umatilla, Skin-pah/Skin, Tenino/Warm Springs), to the southwest along the Lower Snake River and Columbia River (here the Yakama bands lived also in bilingual villages together with Lower Snake River Sahaptin-speaking local groups of Chamnapam/Chem-na-pum, Wauyukma and Naxiyampam), to the northeast their tribal territories ranged up to the Wenatchee River (because of frequently intermarriages some of the originally Interior Salish-speaking Wenatchi bands switched to Sahaptin as first language), in the north to the lakes of Cle Elum Lake (after the Upper Yakama / Kittitas name Tie-el-Lum, meaning \"swift water\", referring to the Cle Elum River), Kachess Lake (\"more fish\") and Keechelus Lake (\"few fish\") at the headwaters of the Yakima River (with the directly northwest living Coast-Salish-speaking Snoqualmie the Yakama bands kept family ties), in the west across the Cascade Range to the headwaters of the Cowlitz River (shch'il), Lewis River ((wl'\u026bt'kh) and White Salmon River (where there were also family ties with Coast-Salish-speaking Lower Cowlitz and Upper Chinookan/Kiksht-speaking Wasco-Wishram). ==History== Yakama woman, ca. 1911 The Yakama people are similar to the other native inhabitants of the Columbia River Plateau. They were hunters and gatherers well-known for trading salmon harvested from annual runs in the Columbia River. In 1805 or 1806, they encountered the Lewis and Clark Expedition at the confluence of the Yakima River and Columbia River. As a consequence of the Walla Walla Council and the Yakima War of 1855, the tribe was forced to cede much of their land and move onto their present reservation.Tribal Ceded Areas in Washington State The Treaty of 1855 identified the 14 confederated tribes and bands of the Yakama, including \"Yakama (Lower Yakama or Yakama proper, autonym: M\u00e1machatpam), Palouse (now written Palus, Yakama name: Pel\u00fauspem), Pisquouse (P'squosa, now Wenatchi), Wenatshapam (Yakama name: Win\u00e1tshapam, now Wenatchi), Klikatat (Yakama name: Xw\u00e1lxwaypam or L'ataxat), Klinquit (a Yakama subtribe), Kow-was-say-ee (Yakama name: Kk\u00e1asu-i or K'kasawi, Tenino subtribe), Li-ay-was (not identified), Skin-pah (Sk'in tribe or Sawpaw, also known as Fall Bridge and Rock Creek people or K'mill\u00e1ma, a Tenino subtribe; perhaps another Yakama name for the Umatilla, which were known as Rock Creek Indians), Wish-ham (Yakama name: W\u00edsh\u03c7am, now Wishram, speaking Upper Chinook (Kiksht)),Eugene Hunn: Anthropological Study of Yakama Tribe: Traditional Resource Harvest Sites West of the Crest of the Cascades Mountains in Washington State and below the Cascades of the Columbia River, October 11, 2003 Shyiks (a Yakama subtribe), Ochechotes (Uchi'chol, a Tenino subtribe), Kah-milt-pay (Kahmiltpah, Q'm\u00edl-pa or Qamil'lma, perhaps a Klikatat subtribe), and Se-ap-cat (Si'apkat, perhaps a Kittitas (Upper Yakama) subtribe, Kittitas autonym: Pshw\u00e1napam or Psch-wan-wap-pams), confederated tribes and bands of Indians, occupying lands hereinafter bounded and described and lying in Washington Territory, who for the purposes of this treaty are to be considered as one nation, under the name 'Yakama'\u2026\". (Treaty with the Yakama, 1855) The name was changed from Yakima to Yakama in 1994 to reflect the native pronunciation. == Language == Yakama tipi, by Edward Curtis, 1910 Yakama is a northwestern dialect of Sahaptin, a Sahaptian language of the Plateau Penutian family. Since the late 20th century, some native speakers have argued to use the traditional Yakama name for this language, Ichishk\u00edin S\u00ednwit. The tribal Cultural Resources program wants to replace the word Sahaptin, which means \"stranger in the land\".Beavert, Virginia and Hargus, Sharon Ichishk\u00edin s\u00ednwit yakama = Yakima Sahaptin dictionary.
