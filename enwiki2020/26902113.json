He was the first keeper of the Wallace Collection at Hertford House, writing its first catalogue, and held that post from 1900 until his retirement in 1911 whereupon he was knighted for his service. Phillips was considered one of the most eminent critics in Victorian Britain, and his numerous scholarly and art history books were widely read. ==Biography== The second son of Robert Abraham Phillips and Helen Levy, Claude Phillips was born at Gloster Villa, Regent's Park, London on 29 January 1846.

(pg. 454) Phillips eventually left the legal profession and became a music critic for the Daily Telegraph in the late 1880s. From 1885 to 1896, he was the English correspondent for the Gazette des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Among other Victorian era publications he wrote for included the Manchester Guardian, the Magazine of Art, the Academy and The Art Journal.Quinn, Richard Harold. Charles Ricketts and the Dial.

One of his best known books was The Life of Sir Joshua Reynolds (1894). After a particularly well-received article on Rodin, he became a full-time art critic for the Daily TelegraphFehlbaum, Valerie. Ella Hepworth Dixon: The Story of a Modern Woman. Aldershot, UK and Burlington, Vermont: Ashgate Publishing, 2005. (pg. 16) in 1897. That same year, Phillips was appointed the first keeper of the Wallace Collection and spent the next three years preparing its catalogue prior to its opening at Hertford House in 1900. He held that post until his retirement 14 years later. In 1914 he was included in a caricature by Edmund Dulac which was part of the Wallace Collection. The humorous painting is called \"Le Legende de Joseph\". Phillips was succeeded by Dugald Sutherland MacColl, and received a knighthood for his service shortly afterwards. Phillips died on 9 August 1924 at the age of 78. A collection of his essays, Emotion in Art (1925), was published posthumously the following year. The caricature of him was eventually given to the UK through the Art Fund, a charity that Phillips helped to set up.La Legende de Joseph, Edmund Dulac, 1914, ArtFund.org, accessed April 2010 ==Bibliography== *Randolph Caldecott (1886) *A Century of French Art at the Paris Exhibition (1889) *Punch Drawings and Cartoons (1891) *Catalogue of a Collection of Drawings by the late Charles Keene (1891) *John Opie (1892) *Venetian Art at the New Gallery (1894) *The Portfolio: Artistic Monographs (1894, with William Sharp, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, F.
