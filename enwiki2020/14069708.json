It has an interesting portal with a relief reflecting the military career of the count as a general in the army of Empress Maria Theresa. During the reconstruction of the palace, parts of a Gothic building were found in walls at the interior of the building. Roman and Celtic finds were uncovered through archaeological research in the basement. The palace used to contain a mint in the past. In 1762, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart played a concert here at the age of six. From 1993 to 2012, the palace was used as the Austrian embassy. ==References== ==External links== * About the palace on the Austrian embassy website Category:Houses completed in 1747 Category:Palaces in Bratislava ",
