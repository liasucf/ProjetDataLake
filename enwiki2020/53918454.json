Rhodes envisioned joint vocational schools as a way to provide proper technical training for rural school districts that did not offer them as their larger city district counterparts had. Six districts initially made up Lorain County JVS before it expanded to its current 13. In the 1980s, the curriculum expanded to include 23 programs, and after the technological boom in the 1990s, more opportunities arose while partnerships with area colleges provided college credits. A 2,400 sq. ft. greenhouse was eventually added as well. Along with being ISO 9001:2000 Certified and accredited by the North Central Association, the school is also affiliated with National Institute for Metalworking Skills (NIMS), National Center for Construction Education & Research (NCCER), American Culinary Federation (ACF), Cisco Systems Networking Academy (Cisco), National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE), and Automotive Yes (AYES).LCJVS. \"History\", Lorain County JVS,. ==Notes== Category:Vocational schools in Ohio ",
