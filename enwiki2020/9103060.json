The youth organisation had a self-governing body that was directly responsible to the leader of EOKA (Georgios Grivas-Digenis). Among its activities were handing out leaflets and magazines, recruitment, writing slogans on walls and demonstrating against the British rule in Cyprus. ==See also== *Index of Cyprus-related articles ==References== Category:EOKA ",
