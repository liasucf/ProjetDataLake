    "text": "State Route 589 (SR 589) comprised a large portion of Sahara Avenue, a major east-west section line road in the Las Vegas Valley. The road is named after the Sahara Hotel and Casino which is located on Las Vegas Boulevard where it intersects with Sahara Avenue. ==Route description== View at the west end of SR 589 looking eastbound in 2015 Sahara Avenue begins in the western valley at Red Rock Ranch Road as the continuation of Desert Foothills Drive west of the Las Vegas Beltway. SR 589 began in the western Las Vegas Valley at its intersection with Rainbow Boulevard (SR 595). From there, the route continued due east to cross Interstate 15 and Las Vegas Boulevard. SR 589 proceeded further east to cross Fremont Street/Boulder Highway (SR 582), entering the unincorporated town of Sunrise Manor, passing under I-515/US 93/US 95 and terminated at Nellis Boulevard (SR 612). Sahara Avenue ends at the Hollywood Regional Park, just east of Hollywood Boulevard. Through much of the Las Vegas area, Sahara Avenue comprises the southern boundary of the City of Las Vegas. At the intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard, Sahara Avenue marks what is typically considered the northern boundary of the Las Vegas Strip. ==History== The road was originally called San Francisco Avenue and served as the southern city limit for Las Vegas. In the 1960s, city planners envisioned construction of an expressway along Sahara to Rainbow Boulevard. The Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) removed SR 589 from its maintenance logs by the beginning of 2019, and has begun the process of turning ownership of the roadway over to the City of Las Vegas and Clark County. ==Major intersections== Junctions listed are for SR 589 only. ==Attractions== * Sahara Las Vegas * Palace Station * Bonanza Gift Shop * The Golden Steer Steakhouse ==Public transport== Current RTC Route Sahara Avenue Express (SX) operated on this road. ==See also== * * ==References== Category:1976 establishments in Nevada Category:2018 disestablishments in Nevada Category:Streets in Las Vegas ",
