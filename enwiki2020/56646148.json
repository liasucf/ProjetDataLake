He is best known for his Emmy Award-nominated and Writers Guild of America Award-winning work on the first season of the true crime anthology television series American Crime Story, titled The People v. O. J. Simpson, and for co- writing the film Black Panther. ==Early life== Cole, an only child, moved around a lot growing up, which he felt \"prepared\" him to be a writer, a desire he only discovered during college. He soon applied to the University of California, Berkeley. ==Career== During his tenure at the university, Cole entered the film business, working as a writer on the 2006 film ATL, although not receiving a credit. In 2011, he released his first feature film as a director and writer, Amber Lake. ===Marvel Studios' program=== After writing a \"Chinatown-style cop script\", Cole was invited to a meeting with Marvel Studios, where he was told that they had plans of doing a movie about the character War Machine. He pitched a story and was chosen to write the film, but, according to him, \"they decided, based on what Iron Man 3 was going to be, they weren't going to do War Machine anymore.\" Marvel subsequently invited him to join its writers program. In regards to the program, Cole said: In 2014, Cole wrote a script for a projected movie about the Inhumans. ===Television=== In 2016, the television series American Crime Story was released. Cole served as co-producer of the first season, The People v. O. J. Simpson, and wrote two episodes, \"The Race Card\" (for which he was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Limited Series, Movie or a Dramatic Special) and \"A Jury in Jail\". ===Black Panther=== While working on The People v. O. J. Simpson, Cole was approached by Marvel Studios' producer Nate Moore, wanting to know if he was willing to write a film about Black Panther. He immediately accepted. Cole was part of a competition, but was ultimately chosen to write the screenplay with director Ryan Coogler. ==Filmography== ===Film=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Year !! Title !!
