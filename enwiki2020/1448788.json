It remained a part of Standard Oil until Standard Oil was broken up in 1911. In 1930, The Ohio Oil Company bought the Transcontinental Oil Company and established the \"Marathon\" brand name. In 1962, the company changed its name to \"Marathon Oil Company\". In 1982, Mobil made a hostile offer to buy the company; however, the board of Marathon Oil rejected the offer and instead sold the company to United States Steel. A legal battle ensued thereafter. After the merger, the headquarters was moved to Houston, Texas in 1990 but the company's refining subsidiary maintained its headquarters in Findlay, Ohio. In 1984, Marathon purchased the U.S. unit of Husky Energy for $505 million. In 1998, Marathon and Ashland, Inc. contributed their refining operations to Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC, now Marathon Petroleum. In 2001, USX, the holding company that owned United States Steel and Marathon, spun off the steel business and, in 2002, USX renamed itself Marathon Oil Corporation. In 2003, Marathon sold its Canadian operations to Husky Energy. In 2003, the company sold its interest in the Yates Oil Field to Kinder Morgan for approximately $225 million. In late 2003, Marathon Oil and its partners Noble Energy and AMPCO started the Bioko Island Malaria Control Project (BIMCP) in Equatorial Guinea. Malaria control activities included indoor residual spraying, improved diagnosis and case management, and capacity building to contain future outbreaks. BIMCP had proven being successful in reducing malaria transmission, reducing the proportion of children with malaria parasites, and improving iron status. BIMCP is perceived as a model of hands-on corporate involvement in a humanitarian effort with government, non-profits and academic organizations to reduce the burden of malaria in countries located in Equatorial Africa. The president of Equatorial Guinea, Obiang Nguema, is one of the world's worst dictators, according to Parade Magazine. Marathon's humanitarian efforts have mitigated some of the criticism resulting from its dealings with Nguema's regime. In 2008, Marathon Oil and Lestis Private Capital Group started the Central Basin Control Project (CBCP). In 2007, Marathon acquired Western Oil Sands for $6.6 billion and gained ownership of its 20 percent stake in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project in northern Alberta and other assets in the midwestern United States. The Athabasca project's Muskeg River Mine was producing approximately 155,000 barrels a day of bitumen at the time. In 2011, Marathon completed the corporate spin-off of Marathon Petroleum, distributing a 100% interest to its shareholders. In June 2013, Marathon sold its Angolan oil and gas field to Sinopec for $1.52 billion. In September 2013, Marathon announced it would sell a 10% stake in an oil and gas field offshore Angola for around $590 million to Sonangol Group. In June 2014, Marathon Oil Norge AS (\u201cMarathon Norway\") was acquired by Det Norske Oljeselskap ASA for US$2.1 billon. ==See also== * Marathon Petroleum * Standard Oil * James C.
