Retrieved 15 May 2019 Kitchen of Haus am Horn Although she worked primarily as a weaver, Otte, on a number of occasions, produced work beyond the medium. Notable among this work is Otte's design for the kitchen of the 1923 Haus am Horn in Weimar, which inspired Margarete Sch\u00fctte-Lihotzky's 1926 Frankfurt kitchen.Markgraf, Monika (ed.)

Halle: Staatliche Galerie Moritzburg In 1929 she reunited with the Czech photographer (1896 - 1934) who studied with Otte at the Bauhaus; Benita married Koch later that year. A number of former students and teachers from the Bauhaus went to work at the school, including: Gerhard Marcks, the Rector from 1928-1933; Hans Wittwer, who ran the Architecture department; Marguerite Friedl\u00e4nder and Erich Consem\u00fcller. Following the Nazi rise to power in 1933, Koch-Otte and other staff considered avant-garde were dismissed from the school. Koch-Otte and her husband then moved to Prague. Heinrich Koch died in a fatal accident in 1934, and Benita returned to Germany where she taught at the Bodelschwingh Foundation Bethel (German:Bodelschwinghsche Stiftungen Bethel), a psychiatric hospital in the Bethel district of Bielefeld. At the hospital, Koch-Otte ran weaving workshop for patients. She worked at the foundation until her 1957 retirement. Koch-Otte died on 26 April 1976 in Bielefeld. Benita Koch-Otte street (Benita-Otte-Stra\u00dfe) in Erfurt is named after her. == References == ==External links== *Bauhaus100.
