During the liberation of the Netherlands at the end of World War II, the mill was damaged by a hand grenade. The mill was fitted with a pair of Ten Have sails in 1948. It ceased working by wind in 1959 and only the power driven mill was used from this date. The mill was restored in 1975, and was worked occasionally afterwards. The mill remained in the Kemper family until 2000, when it was sold to the Stichting Kempermolen. A further restoration in 2002-03 followed the breakage of a sailstock.
