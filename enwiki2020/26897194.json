    "text": "The 1978\u201379 season was Nottingham Forest's second year back in the Football League First Division. They had won the title the previous season. This meant they qualified for the first time in their history for the European Cup. ==Summary== Forest opened the defence of their title with six draws in their first seven league matches. On 28 November the 1\u20130 win at Bolton set an undefeated record of 42 consecutive league games. The record stood for over two decades. Garry Birtles broke into the first team and ended up being the club's top scorer as they ended up as league runners-up, retained the League Cup and won the European Cup. Along the way they knocked out holders Liverpool and came from behind to oust West German champions Cologne. Trevor Francis became the first \u00a31,000,000 player when he signed for the Reds from Birmingham City and immediately proved his worth by scoring the only goal of the European Cup final against Malm\u00f6 in Munich. 26 year old Colin Barrett suffered a serious leg injury 10 days after scoring in the win against Liverpool. He only played seven further competitive games for Forest and 12 in his career. ==Players== ===Squad Stats=== The statistics for the following players are for their time during 1978\u201379 season playing for Nottingham Forest.
