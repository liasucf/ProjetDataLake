    "text": "Soccer was first played in Queensland on a regular basis in Brisbane, in 1884. The game in Queensland is administered by the peak body, Football Queensland, together with several subordinate zone councils, each representing regions of Queensland. ==History== The earliest known game of soccer in Queensland (and possibly Australia) was played at Woogaroo (now Goodna), west of Brisbane, in 1875, when the Brisbane FC (Australian rules club formed in 1866) played at least one game of 'London Association Football' against the inmates and warders of the Woogaroo Lunatic Asylum.\" The earliest known organised games of Association football in Queensland were played in Brisbane in 1884, under the auspices of the newly formed Anglo-Queensland Football Association (a predecessor of Football Queensland). The Brisbane Courier reported in early May 1884: :A MEETING of those favourable to the \"Association\" game of football as played in the home countries was held at the Australian Hotel last night ... [I]t was resolved that it was desirable to form an Anglo-Queensland Football Association, and as a beginning the meeting formed the first club, the name selected being \"St. Andrew's Football Club.\" ... It was announced that already from twenty-seven to thirty promises to join the club had been received, and it was resolved to play a practice match tomorrow afternoon, if possible, in the Queen's Park. The first fixture match was played on 7 June 1884, on the Pineapple Sportsfield (now part of Raymond Park), Kangaroo Point (refer to History of association football in Brisbane, Queensland for more information). By 1886, the game had spread west to Ipswich and then to other regional centres. ==Administration of football in Queensland== ===Football Queensland=== Football Queensland was preceded by a number of organisations: * 1884-1889: Anglo-Queensland Football Association * 1890-1919: Queensland British Football Association * 1920-1927: Queensland Football Association * 1928-1939: Queensland Soccer Council * 1940-1961: Queensland Soccer Football Association * 1962-2005: Queensland Soccer Federation * 2006-Present: Football Queensland ===Queensland Zones=== The game is administered locally by zone councils: * Far North Queensland Football * Football Queensland Brisbane * Football Central Queensland * Football South West Queensland * Football Wide Bay * Football Gold Coast * Mackay Regional Football Zone * North Queensland Football * North West Queensland Soccer Zone Inc * Sunshine Coast Football ==National representation== ===National Soccer League (NSL) 1977-2004=== There were a number of Queensland teams that played in the now defunct National Soccer League. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

In the 2009-10 Hyundai A-League season, two other clubs joined the Roar, Gold Coast United FC and the North Queensland Fury FC (Townsville).. However, the Fury team withdrew from the competition after season 2010-11, citing financial difficulties.. Gold Coast United also left the A-league after the 2011-12 season. They have now reformed in August 2017 and currently compete in the Football Queensland Premier League. ==Club competitions== ===Queensland statewide competitions=== The Queensland State League (QSL) was established in 2008 to provide a second tier competition between the A-League and the Queensland regional competitions. The QSL consisted of a single division, comprising nine teams without provision for promotion or relegation. In 2013 the QSL was replaced by the National Premier Leagues Queensland (NPL Qld) which forms a division within the National Premier Leagues (NPL). The winner (top of the table after the regular season) enters a national finals series against the winners of the other NPL divisions. In 2018 the NPL Queensland will introduce promotion from and relegation to, a new league the Football Queensland Premier League. ===Regional competitions=== Below the NPL Qld there are local competitions run in each of the zones. ==Women's football== Brisbane Roar have a team in the national W-League that represent Queensland's female footballers. ==Footnotes== ==See also== * Football Queensland * History of association football in Brisbane, Queensland * Association football in Australia ==External links== *Football Queensland official website Qu ",
