    "text": "Staller is an Anglo-Saxon title whose origin, and exact meaning, is disputed. One suggestion is it derives from the Latin , or Count of the Stable, a title used in the Byzantine Empire, and later adopted by the Franks. Another theory is it is refers to a seat, or steall in the kings hall, one of the privileges granted a thegn, or royal retainer. However, this is unproved. It seems likely it was a different term for an existing position; the first confirmed occurrence in England was by Edward the Confessor, who used it for senior members of his personal household. Their duties appear to have been flexible; on a charter witnessed by stallers Ansgar, Bondi, Robert FitzWimarc, and Ralph in 1065, they are described as Royal stewards. == Anglo-Saxon office-holders == *Ansgar the Staller (fl 1044-1066) *Bondi the staller (fl 1065) *Eadnoth the Constable (died 1068), also known as Eadnoth the Staller *Ralph the Staller (1011\u20131068) *Robert FitzWimarc (died before 1075), also known as Robert the Staller; * Osgod clapa, London ==References== ==Sources== * * * Category:Anglo-Saxon England ",
