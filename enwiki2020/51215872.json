Capitol Album Discography, Part 5: 600-2999 (1955-1968) accessed July 4, 2016The Capitol Sessions of Stan Kenton: 1967 accessed July 4, 2016 ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Lindsay Planer says \"Combining divergent reworkings of pop music standards with his own undeniably unique originals, Kenton applies his trademark intricate and individual harmonic phrasings. The consistent results bear out his ability to augment his highly stylized arrangements within a framework of familiarity... While enthusiasts of the artist's work will undoubtedly be impressed, to modern ears the easy listening orchestration may seem heavy-handed, if not lackluster\". ==Track listing== All compositions by Stan Kenton except where noted. # \"Sunny\" (Bobby Hebb) - 3:01 # \"Imagine\" (Francis Lai, Sammy Cahn) - 3:00 # \"A Man and a Woman\" (Lai, Cahn) - 4:43 # \"Theme for Jo\" - 3:30 # \"Interchange\" - 3:02 # \"Invitation\" (Bronis\u0142aw Kaper, Paul Francis Webster) - 3:18 # \"Girl Talk\" (Neal Hefti, Bobby Troup) - 4:22 # \"The World We Know\" (Bert Kaempfert, Herbert Rehbein, Carl Sigman) - 2:24 # \"This Hotel\" (Johnny Keating, Richard Quine) - 2:32 # \"Changing Times\" - 3:28 # \"Gloomy Sunday\" (Rezs\u0151 Seress, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 J\u00e1vor, Sam M.
