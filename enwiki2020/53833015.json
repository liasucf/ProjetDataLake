It was then a quiet station, serving a village of just 327 in 1901. In the 1930s, it had 16 employees. Like many other stations in this part of Wales, it saw passenger numbers fall in the postwar years. Peterston was subsequently de-staffed from 6 April 1959, and closed to goods in 1962.Mitchell, V. & Smith, K. Cardiff to Swansea. Middleton Press. 2009. After this point, the only passenger trains which stopped there were the 7.00am from Swansea to Weston-super-Mare, and the 5.30pm service from Cardiff to Porthcawl. The station was listed for closure in the Beeching Axe, and the services were withdrawn.Horton, P. The Beeching Legacy. Silver Link. 2013. p.139 Peterston had a goods loop, which closed in 1964. ==References== Category:Disused railway stations in Cardiff Category:Former Great Western Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1858 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1964 Category:Beeching closures in Wales Category:1858 establishments in Wales Category:1964 disestablishments in Wales ",
