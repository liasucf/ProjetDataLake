She brings up the topic of privatization of schools including charter schools and other private institutions. The idea that comes up most passionately is that democracy is just a cover for meritocracy and the future of the US is based on the success of our children.Fabricant, M. and Fine, M. (2013). The Changing Politics of Education: Privatization and the Dispossessed Lives of Those Left Behind. Paradigm Publishers. *Charter Schools and the Corporate Makeover of Public Education explores the gap between the promise and the performance of charter schools. The authors do not defend the public school system, which for decades has failed primarily poor children of color. They use empirical evidence to determine whether charter schooling is a valid alternative for poor children of color, and offers an authentic alternative for these children. Fine also writes about the history of charter schools in public education.Fabricant, M. and Fine, M. (2012) Charter Schools and the Corporate Make Over of Public Education. New York: Teachers College Press. *Revolutionizing Education offers a broad basis for understanding this research methodology.

These youth must fight against popular cultural representations of Muslim-men-as-terrorists and Muslim-women-as-oppressed. These are shown through the suspicious gaze of peers, teachers, and strangers, and police. The concern about not being American citizens when they are has led to controversy and a lack of understanding among their peers.Sirin, S. and Fine, M.
