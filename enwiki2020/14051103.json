    "text": "Lisa-Michelle Scaffidi (; born 12 February 1960) is a former Lord Mayor of Perth, Western Australia. The first female Lord Mayor of Perth, Scaffidi became mayor following the October 2007 council elections, after the retirement of her predecessor, Peter Nattrass, who served a record twelve years in the position. Scaffidi and the rest of the City of Perth council were suspended on 2 March 2018, while the state government investigated the council's operations. ==Early life== Scaffidi was educated at Churchlands Primary School and Methodist Ladies' College after which she graduated as a dental therapist from the Western Australian Institute of Technology (now Curtin University). She served as an air hostess with TAA in 1980, worked in the hospitality industry in a marketing capacity and, in the 1990s, helped to promote export of semi-precious stones. She was the WA State Director of the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) for over ten years. She served two terms as a councillor before successfully contesting the lord- mayoralty. == Corruption and Crime Commission == In October 2015, the Corruption and Crime Commission of Western Australia found that Scaffidi had \"signally failed in her duties\" as lord mayor by accepting and failing to declare a $31,000 travel package to the 2008 Beijing Olympics from BHP, and other gifts from private companies that have dealings with the City of Perth. The commission found that Scaffidi had committed acts of \"serious misconduct\" but believed she had not acted corruptly. In 2016, Scaffidi insulted journalist Liam Bartlett on social media and was criticised by journalists for refusing to answer his questions about the undeclared travel and gifts while the matter was before the State Administrative Tribunal. ==Further investigation and suspension== In May 2017 Western Australia's State Administrative Tribunal ruled that Scaffidi had committed 45 \"serious breaches\" of local government laws by failing to disclose gifts and overseas travel. The tribunal had the power to disqualify her from office for up to five years. In the previous month Western Australian Premier Mark McGowan called on Scaffidi to step aside and stated that he would look at the means to sack the lord mayor if she did not resign. He also called on the City of Perth councillors to move a motion of no confidence in the lord mayor. On 8 September, Scaffidi agreed to step aside pending a court appeal into the ruling. In early December 2017, the Court of Appeal set aside the Tribunal's orders, and Scaffidi announced that she would return to her statutory duties on 8 January 2018. On 2 March 2018, the Minister for Local Government, David Templeman, indefinitely suspended the entire City of Perth council, including Scaffidi, while a government panel investigates its operation and conduct. The move came after years of infighting between factions on council. The panel will make a recommendation as to whether the council should be permanently sacked. A government-appointed commission will oversee the city's operations while the investigation is underway. In October 2019, Scaffidi's term as Lord Mayor expired and the office was declared vacant until new elections could be scheduled in October 2020. ==References== ==Further reading== *West Weekend Magazine (West Australian newspaper), 27 October 2007. pp. 8\u201310 * Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Mayors and Lord Mayors of Perth, Western Australia Category:Women mayors of places in Australia Category:People educated at Methodist Ladies' College, Perth Category:Curtin University alumni ",
