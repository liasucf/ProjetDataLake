She replaced the 1910 SS Prince George of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway which sank under tow in Unimak Pass, Alaska, en route to China on October 25, 1945. ==Construction== Prince George was built at Yarrows Ltd. at Esquimalt, British Columbia. The vessel cost $3,000,000 to build. It was then the largest private commercial vessel ever constructed in Canada. ==Specifications== Prince George was long, with a beam of and a depth of hold of . The overall size of the vessel was 5,812 tons. Prince George had accommodations for 322 passengers, all but 28 of which were considered first class. Each stateroom had fold-away bunks to allow it to be converted into a sitting room. There were several deluxe suites and also a children's playroom. There were seven decks. The steamer had a moderately streamlined appearance. The ship also had space for of cargo, including of refrigerated space. An elevator allowed ready transfer of automobiles from storage on the orlop deck to the main deck for loading and unloading. ==Engineering== The ship was powered by two six-cylinder ( bore by stroke) uniflow steam engines, using steam at generated by four Yarrow naval boilers, each with four oil burners. Prince George maintained a service speed of . ==Career== In September 1950, Prince George collided with the Canadian Pacific coastal liner . The collision occurred northwest of Prince Rupert, British Columbia. Both ships were equipped with radar. Damage to Princess Kathleen was about $250,000. Damage to Prince George was about $100,000. Both ships made it to port under their own power. Between them, the two ships were carrying 450 passengers at the time of the collision. On October 18, 1953, Prince George, operating in a heavy fog with its radar nonfunctional, ran aground at Ripple Point, in Johnstone Strait. Captain E.B. Caldwell, then the senior Canadian National master, was in the bridge navigating by whistle and echo at the time of the grounding. Captain Caldwell saw the point shortly before striking it, and ordered the helm over, which spared the steamer from a head on strike on the point. As a result the hull sustained only minor damage. Prince George was assisted to port with tugs, with one of its own engines still in operation. There were no casualties. In 1959, Prince George, departing from British Columbia ports, was employed on summer cruises to Alaska. ==Disposition== The ship was sold in 1976 for use as a floating restaurant, and passed through the hands of several different owners until October 1995, when it caught fire at Britannia Beach, BC, and was sold for scrap. ==References== Category:1947 ships Category:History of British Columbia Category:Steamboats of Alaska Category:Water transport in British Columbia ",
