    "text": "Prof. Dr. Hilde (Hildegard) Zaloscer (Zaloszer) (15 June 1903 \u2013 20 December 1999) was an art historian, Egyptologist, Coptologist, essayist, novelist and a prominent expert of Coptic history and art. ==Biography== Zaloscer was born in Tuzla, Bosnia Herzegovina (then Austria-Hungary), the eldest daughter of the affluent Jewish lawyer and state-official Dr. Jacob and his wife Bertha (n\u00e9e Kallach). Since her father was a state official and a known Austrian monarchist, the family had to flee to Vienna when the Austrian monarchy collapsed, at the end of the First World War (1918). Her family settled in Vienna, where she finished her secondary education and studied art history and prehistory at the Vienna University (Ph.D. 1926, her dissertation being \"Die fr\u00fchmittelalterliche Dreistreifenornamentik der Mittelmeerrandgebiete mit besonderer Ber\u00fccksichtigung der Denkm\u00e4ler am Balkan\"). From 1927 to 1936, Zaloscer was the editor of the art magazine Belvedere, and corresponded with Thomas Mann. Due to the rise of anti-Semitism in Vienna she emigrated to Egypt in 1936. According to an article penned by author Judith Belfkih for the Wiener Zeitung, the Jewish Museum Vienna determined that Zaloscer was one of at least 13 women who undertook \"fictitious marriages\" to escape Nazi persecution through emigration during World War II: > What almost unites them all: the women were silent for a long time about > their fictitious marriages and the resulting double lives - to protect the > children or the later partners. The motivation of the women was clear: they > fought for survival and deliberately accepted the many risks - from > denunciation of extortion and sexual assault - to their safety.... The > biographies traced in the exhibition certainly convey the image of extremely > self-confident and equally courageous women - by the political activist and > writer Hilda Monte, the later doctor Rosl Ebner or the art historian Hilde > Zaloscer, who was professionally married to Egyptian exile. Between 1946 and 1968, Zaloscer was a professor of art history at the University of Alexandria where she became a prominent and world-renowned expert on Coptic art. After the Six Day War (1967), she was expelled from Egypt since she was Jewish. She lived temporarily in Vienna from 1968 to 1970 and, in the following two years, Zaloscer was a professor at the Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, before returning to Vienna. From 1975 to 1978, she was a lecturer at the University of Vienna. Zaloscer was a prolific essayist and writer and among others was an editor of the Encyclopedia Coptica. ==Awards and honors== Hilde Zaloscer's name (bottom right) on the monument to victims of the Kunsthistorisches Institut, University of Vienna. * Theodor-K\u00f6rner Prize (Austria) * Adolf-Sch\u00e4rf Prize * The Golden Honorary Doctorate of the Vienna University * Goldenes Verdienstkreuz des Landes Wien * Kulturmedaille der Stadt Linz ==Publications== * * * * * Zaloscer, Hilde Visuelle Beschw\u00f6rung, autonomes Kunstwerk, Ideograph 1997 * Zaloscer, Hilde Wissenschaftliche Arbeit ohne wissenschaftlichen Apparat 2004 * Zaloscer, Hilde Zu \u00e4gyptischen Totenmasken 1999 * Zaloscer, Hilde \u00c4gyptische Textilkunst 1993 * Zaloscer, Hilde \u00c4gyptische Wirkereien 1962 * Zaloscer, Hilde Die Antithetik im Werke Thomas Manns 1959 * Zaloscer, Hilde Das dreimalige Exil 2004 * Zaloscer, Hilde Eine Heimkehr gibt es nicht 1988 * Zaloscer, Hilde La Femme au voile dans l\u2019iconographie copte 1955 * Zaloscer, Hilde Die fr\u00fchmittelalterliche Dreistreifornamentik der Mittelmeerrandgebiete mit besonderer Ber\u00fccksichtigung der Denkm\u00e4ler am Balkan 1926 * Zaloscer, Hilde Le Greco 1946 * Zaloscer, Hilde Die Kunst im christlichen \u00c4gypten 1974 * Zaloscer, Hilde Kunstgeschichte und Nationalsozialismus 2004 * Zaloscer, Hilde Portr\u00e4ts aus dem W\u00fcstensand 1961 * Zaloscer, Hilde Le \"Doctor Faustus\" de Thomas Mann et ses mod\u00e8les 1953 * Zaloscer, Hilde De la composition musicale dans les oeuvres litt\u00e9raires 1953 * Zaloscer, Hilde Quelques consid\u00e9rations sur les rapports entre l\u2019art copte et les Indes 1947 ==References== Category:Coptologists Category:Austrian Egyptologists Category:University of Vienna alumni Category:Writers from Vienna Category:People from Alexandria Category:Austrian Jews Category:Austrian historians Category:Austrian people of Bosnia and Herzegovina-Jewish descent Category:1903 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Alexandria University faculty Category:Carleton University faculty Category:University of Vienna faculty Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina Jews Category:20th-century historians ",
