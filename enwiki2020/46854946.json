    "text": "Davide Calabria (born 6 December 1996) is an Italian professional footballer, who plays for Milan as a full-back, mainly on the right side of the pitch. ==Club career== Calabria has been with A.C. Milan since 2006, playing for the club's youth teams of different age groups up until Primavera (U-19). He received his first ever call-up to the senior team ahead of the away game against S.S. Lazio played on 25 January 2015; he, however, remained an unused substitute. He made his Serie A debut on 30 May 2015 against Atalanta, replacing Mattia De Sciglio at the 84th minute in a 1\u20133 away win. On 15 July 2015 Calabria was officially promoted to the first team. He made his first start in a 3\u20132 win over Palermo on 22 September, playing 49 minutes, and was highly praised for his performance. Ahead of the 2017\u201318 season, Milan acquired Atalanta's Andrea Conti for nearly \u20ac25 million, viewing the player as the most likely starter on the right side of the team's defensive line; Calabria had been persuaded yet refused to join one of the lower-ranking Serie A teams on loan to increase his playing time. In September 2017, Conti injured his anterior cruciate ligament for the first time, and in March 2018 suffered a recurrence of the injury, effectively ending his season. The club ruled out the possibility of any further emergency signings, thus trusting Calabria as a long-term replacement for Conti in the right full-back position.https://www.agentianonimi.com/milan-conti-sostituti/ He completed the season with 30 appearances in all competitions and scored his debut goal in senior professional football on 25 February 2018 in the Serie A 2\u20130 away win against Roma. ==International career== Calabria made his debut for the Italy U21 on 13 October 2015, in a qualifying match against Republic of Ireland. In June 2017, he was included in the Italy under-21 squad for the 2017 UEFA European Under-21 Championship by manager Luigi Di Biagio. Italy were eliminated by Spain in the semi-finals on 27 June, following a 3\u20131 defeat. Italy were eliminated in the semi-finals following a 3\u20131 defeat to Spain on 27 June. ==Style of play== Calabria is a quick and modern full-back who likes to get forward and support his team's attacking moves. His strong overlapping offensive runs, crossing ability, and solid technique caused problems for Juventus in the 2016 Coppa Italia Final although it was he who did not chase \u00c1lvaro Morata down his flank to prevent the creation of a scoring opportunity. Regarded as a promising young player, defensively, his positioning, decision- making, and tackling are commendable, and he has also drawn praise from pundits and former footballers for his maturity and personality in spite of his youth. Although he is not physically dominant, he is gifted with good pace and stamina, and can also recover to his defensive position quickly, which enables him to cover the flank effectively. A former midfielder in his youth, while he is mainly deployed as a right-back, he is a highly versatile player who is capable of playing in several positions, and is equally adept at left- back due to his ability with both feet, despite being naturally right-footed. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"7\"|Milan |2014\u201315 |rowspan=\"7\"|Serie A ||1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0 |- |2015\u201316 ||6||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||8||0 |- |2016\u201317 ||12||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||13||0 |- |2017\u201318 |21||1||4||0||5All appearances in Europa League||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||30||1 |- |2018\u201319 |26||1||2||0||4||0||1All appearances in Supercoppa Italiana||0||33||1 |- |2019\u201320 ||25||1||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||27||1 |- |2020\u201321 ||4||0||0||0||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||7||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !95!!3!!11!!0!!12!!0!!1!!0!!119!!3 |} ==See also== *Supercoppa Italiana *2016 Supercoppa Italiana ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * *Davide Calabria at A.C.
