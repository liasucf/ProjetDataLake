    "text": "The Quintana House is a sample of the ancient architecture of the municipality of Guia de Gran Canaria in the Canarian island of Gran Canaria, located in the Plaza Mayor de Gu\u00eda and its buildings date from the 16th century. The Canarian balcony is of Mudejar style, in wood and coat of arms with the surnames Guanarteme and Quintana. == History == Gu\u00eda de Gran Canaria was, until 1526, a population administratively dependent on G\u00e1ldar. Then it got the Mayor's Wand. To govern the new City Council, Governor Mart\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez de Cer\u00f3n granted Fernando Alonso de la Guardia the title of Royal Mayor. This first Guian mayor fixed his residence in the lower part of the town, facing the still undeclared parish of Santa Mar\u00eda de Gu\u00eda, which would obtain such recognition in 1533 (the aforementioned area of the casco would be known as \"Villa de Abajo\", in opposition to the\" Villa de Arriba\" that would form in the surroundings of the hermitage of San Roque). After several decades, at the beginning of the 17th century, the house had become the property of Gonzalo de Quintana and Betancourt, which is why it is known as Casa Quintana or De los Quintana.Short description of the building's history Source: University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria Presumably, after the previous marriage, his son Juan Antonio de Acedo Bethencourt and Quintana Guanarteme inherited the house, born in Gu\u00eda in 1695 and married in Las Palmas with Ana de Bethencourt Amoreto Westerling, and from his numerous offspring he went to the property of Luis Francisco de Acedo Bethencourt and Bethencourt who married Mar\u00eda Magdalena Su\u00e1rez de Aguilar Medina, marriage already cited in the history of the house of the Acedo. In the 19th century Luis Francisco died in January 1817, after his wife had died in April 1805, her daughter Mar\u00eda de los Dolores Acedo and Suarez inherited it, who died single in Las Palmas on June 17, 1887 at the age of 95 years, leaving testamentary dispositions before the notary Jos\u00e9 Ben\u00edtez Llarena in which he designates as his heir of his property his nephew Jos\u00e9 Acedo Martin\u00f3n as a lifetime usufruct and upon his death he should fall equally among his children called Jos\u00e9, Agust\u00edn, Isidro and Mar\u00eda del Pino Acedo Llarena. But among its provisions there were express legacies such as the one that it makes regarding the house in the square in favor of Teresa Vald\u00e9s y Acedo, widow of Jos\u00e9 P\u00e1ez, establishing that upon her death they would fall in favor of the children of her other nephew Isidro Acedo Martin\u00f3n. Consequently, in December 1887 Mar\u00eda Teresa Vald\u00e9s registered said usufruct in her name for which it was necessary to make a record because the house was not registered in the Registry. Therefore, immediately after the death of Mar\u00eda Acedo Su\u00e1rez, her cousin Jos\u00e9 Acedo Martin\u00f3n went to the Guide Court to testify the previous data of origin of the house to state that since despite having inherited it, it did not appear inscribed in his name in the corresponding mortgage registry that worked then in the town hall, and requests to fulfill this requirement, surely to be able to exercise its inherited right. The petition was admitted and required several witnesses, who were Pedro Bautista Hern\u00e1ndez and Antonio Galv\u00e1n Pag\u00e1n, to prove the veracity of the information they answered affirmatively. The file passed to prosecutor Ignacio D\u00edaz Lorenzo, who approved it and Judge Francisco Lorenzo Montesdeoca issued a self-approval for what was registered in November 1887. In November 1891, Teresa Vald\u00e9s sells said usufruct to Antonio Medina Mart\u00edn, who in December 1908 together with the lump property owned by Jos\u00e9, Agust\u00edn, Isidro and Mar\u00eda del Pino Acedo Llarena, were transferred to Mar\u00eda del Carmen Mart\u00edn Padr\u00f3n, woman who was from Francisco Gonz\u00e1lez Santana. By testament of the said, dated July 26, 1923, before the notary Salvador Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez, he declares his sons Manuel, Santiago, Francisco, Alfredo, Aurelio and Asunci\u00f3n Gonz\u00e1lez Mart\u00edn as heirs. In the partition of these goods, the house corresponded to Santiago Gonz\u00e1lez Mart\u00edn, who registered it in his name in November 1928. There are written references that at the end of the 18th century or the beginning of the 19th century they occupied the house, possibly rented, the Montesdeoca brothers, -Gaspar and Lorenzo, heals both, since the second was benefited from said church and later canon of the cathedral- who commissioned Luj\u00e1n P\u00e9rez the magnificent stature of the Virgen de las Mercedes. It is said that in the basement of the typical balcony of this house, theatrical performances were held every year on September 24, and in one of these it was where the archdeacon of Fuerteventura, Jos\u00e9 de Viera y Clavijo, discovered the skills of a child from whom He became a protector and would later be the priest of the Tabernacle, politician in the Cortes of C\u00e1diz and canon of the Cathedral of Havana: Pedro Jos\u00e9 Gordillo Ramos. It was the childhood home of Sim\u00f3n Bonifacio Rodr\u00edguez y Rodr\u00edguez and Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez y Rodr\u00edguez, in which the latter lived from 1934 until his death in 2012. == Architecture == Inner courtyard of Casa Quintana in 2012 The remaining building preserves little of the century of its origin, the XVI century. Of this the most striking is a door on the left side of the inner courtyard that is topped by a late Gothic arc of memories, specifically those known as ogee arch.Article of the Quintana House in the Historical Heritage portal of the Gran Canaria council Source: Cabildo of Gran Canaria The architecture conforms to the traditional domestic architecture of the well-to-do class of the Canary Islands: through its main facade crosses the vestibule that gives access to the interior courtyard, from which various rooms depart, as well as the staircase that leads to the upper floor. On this floor are found interesting Mudejar wood paneling with rococo details as well as the cupboard attached or recessed in the dining room. Other locations of the inferior plants are the cellars and the old stable. The most characteristic architectural elements are located in the main fa\u00e7ade, such as the portal framed by stonework that presents a chiaroscuro known as cushioning. This frame is of a frequent typology in different points of Gran Canaria. More precisely it displays a form in which the main door is united with a window of the superior plant that is decorated as well with the corresponding sill and the cornice that crowns the whole.Article of the Casa Quintana in the tourist portal of the Santa Mar\u00eda de Gu\u00eda Town Hall Source: City Hall of Santa Maria de Guia of Gran Canaria However, the fa\u00e7ade has another more significant element: on its right side is a balcony of covered carpentry and with railing or handrail of lattice grid. It is an even more singular balcony because its location on the facade. It is on the right-hand side.Architectural reference of the Casa Quintana Source: University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria == Status == Casa Quintana currently in a state of neglect This building is considered Good of Cultural Interest within the Historic Site of Santa Mar\u00eda of Gu\u00eda de Gran Canaria, for its history and artistic value, as well as for being in Guia's main square.
