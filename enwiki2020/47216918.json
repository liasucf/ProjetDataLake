    "text": "Bavarisauridae is an extinct family of basal lizards found in the Solnhofen limestone near Bavaria, Germany. Two genera are recognized: BavarisaurusBavarisaurus at Fossilworks.org and Schoenesmahl. Up until 2017, Bavarisaurus was the only genus in the family, and it might be the only true bavarisaurus since Schoenesmahl might have instead been part of the Eichstaettisauridae. == References == Category:Solnhofen fauna Category:Jurassic lizards Category:Scincogekkonomorpha ",
