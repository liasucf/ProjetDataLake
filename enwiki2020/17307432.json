As they had done with their former home, Clydesdale rented the grounds at Titwood from the Pollok Estate. The original pitch was situated next to Darnley Road, on land now occupied by Hutchesons' Grammar School. In 1904, the pitch was relocated westwards and a new pavilion constructed. Clydesdale bought Titwood from the Pollok Estate in 1987 for \u00a329,000. Titwood has been selected to host four first first-class matches involving Scotland, the first against the Marylebone Cricket Club in July 1963. The annual fixture against Ireland was staged at Titwood in 1984 and 1986. An ICC Intercontinental Cup match against Kenya was scheduled to be played on the ground in 2008, but no play was possible due to rain. ==ODI's Hosted== Ryan Watson batting against India at Titwood in August 2007 {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\" |- !
