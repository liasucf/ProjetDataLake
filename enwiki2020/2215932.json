    "text": "Freda Wright-Sorce (June 7, 1955 \u2013 July 10, 2005) was the wife of Don Geronimo (Mike Sorce), half of the duo of the Don and Mike Show, a syndicated radio program in the United States. Because of her frequent call-ins to the show and other appearances, she was recognized as a supporting radio personality of some fame for her spirited on-air exchanges with her husband and the other personalities of the Don and Mike Show. Wright-Sorce grew up in Montgomery County, Maryland, and attended Magruder High School. She had a radio career herself, working as a producer and part-time disc jockey in the 1980s at Washington-area stations WHFS, WASH-FM, and WAVA-FM. She met her husband at a radio convention. The couple has one son, Bart, who is a graduate of Clemson University in South Carolina. On July 10, 2005, she died as a result of injuries sustained in an automobile accident on Maryland Route 90 near Ocean City. She was 50 years old and was considered an integral part of The Don and Mike Show. With Don absent, the entire following show on July 11, 2005, as well as the opening segment of the next show on July 12, 2005, was dedicated to remembering Freda. With Mike O'Meara, the other half of the Don and Mike Show, acting as the head of the show, Don was on hiatus until August 1, 2005, when he returned to the air. Without the other members of the show, he spoke as Mike Sorce, his real name, not as the \"Don Geronimo\" radio persona. Sorce spoke plainly and honestly about his wife of 20 years and read love letters they had written over the course of their 25 years together (including a letter he discovered Freda had left in the family safe to be read in the event of her death), played their favorite songs including \"Don't Worry Baby\" by The Beach Boys and \"Everlasting Love\". ==References== ==External links== * Category:1955 births Category:2005 deaths Category:American radio personalities Category:Clemson University alumni Category:Road incident deaths in Maryland Category:People from Montgomery County, Maryland Category:Accidental deaths in Maryland ",
