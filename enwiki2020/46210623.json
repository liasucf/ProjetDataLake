    "text": "Vilar Dam (, also known as Barragem de Vilar-Tabua\u00e7o) is an embankment dam on the T\u00e1vora, a left (southern) tributary of the Douro. It is located in the municipality Tabua\u00e7o, in Viseu District, Portugal. Construction of the dam began in 1958 and was completed in 1965. It is owned by Companhia Portuguesa de Produ\u00e7\u00e3o de Electricidade (CPPE) and is used for power generation. ==Dam== Vilar Dam is a 58 m tall (height above foundation) and 240 m long rockfill embankment dam with a crest altitude of 555 m. The upstream facing of the dam is made of concrete. The volume of the dam is 300,000 m\u00b3. The chute spillway with 2 radial gates is located at the right side of the dam. The maximum discharge is 500 m\u00b3/s. There is also a bottom outlet. ==Reservoir== At full reservoir level of 552 m the reservoir of the dam has a surface area of 6.7km\u00b2 and a total capacity of 99.75 mio. m\u00b3. The active capacity is 95.27 (95.3 or 96) mio. m\u00b3. With the 95.3 mio. m\u00b3 of water 115.6 GWh can be produced. ==Power plant == The hydroelectric power plant was commissioned in 1965. It is operated by EDP. The plant has a nameplate capacity of 58 (64) MW. Its average annual generation is 137.6 (123 or 148) GWh. The power station contains 2 Pelton turbine-generators (vertical shaft) with 32.65 MW (40 MVA) in an underground powerhouse 350 m below the surface, located 15.6 km from the dam. The turbine rotation is 500 rpm. The minimum hydraulic head is 432.5 m, and the maximum 461 m. Maximum flow per turbine is 9 m\u00b3/s. ==See also== * List of power stations in Portugal * List of dams and reservoirs in Portugal ==References== Category:Dams in Portugal Category:Hydroelectric power stations in Portugal Category:Embankment dams Category:Dams completed in 1965 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1965 Category:1965 establishments in Portugal Category:Buildings and structures in Viseu District Category:Underground power stations ",
