    "text": "The 2017 North Ayrshire Council election took place on 4 May 2017 to elect members of North Ayrshire Council. The election used the ten wards created as a result of the 2015\u201316 boundary review, with each ward electing three or four Councillors using the single transferable vote system a form of proportional representation, with 33 Councillors being elected. After the election, the Labour Party took control of the authority as a minority administration with outgoing council Leader Joe Cullinane being reappointed. ==Election result== Note: \"Votes\" are the first preference votes. The net gain/loss and percentage changes relate to the result of the previous Scottish local elections on 3 May 2007. There were three more seats in this election than the previous and, as a result, this may differ from other published sources showing gain/loss relative to seats held at dissolution of Scotland's councils. ==Ward results== ===Irvine West=== *2012: 2xLab; 2xSNP *2017: 2xLab; 1xSNP; 1xCon *2012\u20132017: Con gain one seat from SNP ===Irvine East=== *2012: 2xSNP; 2xLab *2017: 1xSNP; 1xLab; 1xCon *2012\u20132017 Change: Con gain one seat; SNP lose one seat; Lab lose one seat; Ward returns one fewer member ===Kilwinning=== *2012: 2xLab; 1xSNP; 1xIndependent *2017: 2xLab; 1xSNP; 1xCon *2012\u20132017 Change: Con gain one seat from Independent ===Stevenston=== *2012: 2xLab; 1xSNP; 1xIndependent *2017: 2xLab; 1xSNP *2012\u20132017 Change: Independent lose one seat; Ward returns one fewer member 1 Sitting councillor for Saltcoats and Stevenston ward ===Ardrossan and Arran=== *2012: 2xSNP; 1xIndependent; 1xLab *2017: 2xSNP; 1xCon *2012\u20132017 Change: Con gain one seat; Independent lose one seat; Lab lose one seat; Ward returns one less member ===Dalry and West Kilbride=== *2012: 2xIndependent; 1xSNP *2017: 1xIndependent; 1xSNP; 1xCon *2012\u20132017 Change: Con gain one seat from Independent ===Kilbirnie and Beith=== *2012: 1xSNP; 1xIndependent; 1xLab *2017: 1xSNP; 1xIndependent; 1xLab *2012\u20132017 Change: No change ===North Coast and Cumbraes=== *2012: 2xSNP; 1xLab; 1xCon *2017: 1xSNP; 1xLab; 1xCon; 1xIndependent *2012\u20132017 Change: Independent gain one seat from SNP ===Saltcoats=== *2017: 1xSNP; 1xIndependent; 1xLab *New ward 1 Sitting councillor for Saltcoats and Stevenston ward ===Irvine South=== *2017: 1xLab; 1xSNP; 1xCon *New ward 1 Sitting councillor for Irvine West ward == References == * 2017 Category:2017 Scottish local elections ",
