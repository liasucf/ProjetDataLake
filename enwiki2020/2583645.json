Since then it has grown, not only to manage links between 110 schools in the UK and 80 in Ethiopia, but to include a child sponsorship programme, volunteer teaching scheme and infrastructure, resourcing and training projects in schools in Ethiopia. Link Ethiopia now benefits around 100,000 children in Ethiopia through school linking and projects and 30,000 in the UK through cultural exchange programmes. ==History== GondarLink was set up in 1996 by Chris Grant,Michael North \"School costs \u00a33 per pupil - per year\" Bucks Examiner June 21st 1996 a teacher at Dr Challoner's Grammar School in Amersham.

The first of these links was formed between Brushwood School, Chesham and Meseret Elementary School, Gondar in June 2003. From 2003 the number of school links grew, with 135 schools in the UK and 2 in the US currently linked with 80 schools across Ethiopia. To reflect this shift from a regional focus in Gondar to the development of links across Ethiopia, GondarLink changed its name in 2005 to Link Ethiopia.Charity Commission Charity Commission Registration Charity Commission ==School linking== School linking has remained one of Link Ethiopia's primary focuses in its work. The links enable young people in the UK, US and Ethiopia to work together and learn about each other and each other's cultures. Schools take part in a number of different activities including shared learning activities, where students in each country take part in the same activities and share their experiences afterwards, and letter writing between schools which encourages students to ask their own questions about their linked school's culture. Link Ethiopia's school links programme has been praised by a number of organisations including Think Global: The Development Education Association Global Dimension School Links & Partnership Think Global and the BBC, who made Link Ethiopia a partner in their \"World Class\" programme.BBC World Class Meet our partners BBC ==References== ==External links== *Link Ethiopia website *Link Ethiopia's Charity Commission Page Category:Charities based in London Category:Gondar ",
