    "text": "\"Jekyll and Hyde\" is a single by American heavy metal band Five Finger Death Punch from their sixth studio album, Got Your Six. It is the first single from the album, and is the twentieth single overall from the band, which was released on 15 June 2015. == Composition and theme == The song formed from a voice mail left at 2:30AM by lead vocalist Ivan Moody to guitarist Jason Hook. Hook made the voice mail into a song, which was well received by the other members of the band. == Release == On 15 June 2015, the song was premiered via MonsterEnergy.com in addition to rock radio stations around the country. The song is part of a video created to promote their tour in late 2015 with Papa Roach, In This Moment and From Ashes to New. The music video and song are playable in the video game Guitar Hero Live. A music video was made and uploaded to YouTube on June 29, 2015. It begins with a prologue giving the background of the music video itself, indirectly explaining stylistic choices made for the video. The band is talking to someone over the phone (it is not specified who or what he does, but it can be assumed he is from the band's record label) before a concert. They are talking about a music video which the band does not want to do and the voice claims \"[you've] been promising it to us for a while and it's just not happening,\" to which Moody replies \"We just don't do music videos anymore.\" Zoltan Bathory asks if they have to be in the music video, and the voice tells them yes, \"...preferably dressed looking like Five Finger Death Punch.\" The call ends, and the band begins trying to come up with ideas for the music video. Spencer and Kael agree that they want to break stuff, and the band decides that they're going to make it completely ridiculous and silly instead of serious. In the music video portion, the members are in different rooms doing various things in ridiculous outfits. Moody is watching a movie in a Napoleon Dynamite T-shirt and Minion pajama pants, Hook is playing guitar on a couch wearing goggles and a jumpsuit, Spencer is sitting at a table with a coffee machine in a football jersey and helmet (though he is lacking in pants), Bathory is loading and shooting guns into the air wearing slippers shaped like bear paws, and Kael is knitting a baby sock. Towards the end, some of the members begin breaking things (Moody smashes a TV, Spencer headbutts the coffee machine, Kael flips a table and saws it with a chainsaw). The video ends with Bathory and Spencer talking after the concert, and Bathory says \"My joy in this is giving it to the [record] label and watching the horrific looks on their faces,\" and Spencer agrees. == Chart performance == ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (2015) !Peak position |- |US Bubbling Under Hot 100 (Billboard) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|23 |- |US Mainstream Rock Songs (Billboard) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|3 |- |US Hot Rock Songs (Billboard) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|12 |- |US Rock Airplay (Billboard) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|17 |- | scope=\"row\"| US Rock Digital Songs (Billboard) |8 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Chart (2015) !Position |- |US Hot Rock Songs (Billboard) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|29 |} == References == Category:Five Finger Death Punch songs Category:2015 songs Category:2015 singles Category:Song recordings produced by Kevin Churko Category:Songs written by Kevin Churko Category:Songs written by Zoltan Bathory Category:Songs written by Ivan Moody (vocalist) Category:Songs written by Jason Hook Category:Songs written by Jeremy Spencer (drummer) ",
