The principal contemporary alternate spellings Farrer, Farra, '''Ferrar, Pharo occasionally, but not necessarily Farrow, and is an occupational surname for a blacksmith or ironworker - derived from the Latin ferrarius - Middle English Ferror (a smith) as an occupation, Anglo-Norman ferrur, and thus shares a common occupational derivation with the most common English surname, Smith. There are records of an Osbert le ferrur and Peter le ferrour previous to the Poll tax of 1377, but in those cases ferrur is not a name, it is an occupation i.e. Thomas the horseshoer The Subsidy roll (Poll tax) of 1379, for the town of Elland, Halifax Parish, Morley Wapentake, West Riding of Yorkshire lists a Johannes de Helistones, fferror & uxor (John of Helistones, Ferror and (his) wife, indicating that he was a \"ferror\"; also in the same subsidy roll is Henricus de Langfeld', ffranklayn, & uxor, which translates into Henry of Langfeld, freeman and (his) wife.

Due to varying levels of literacy, and regional dialects the name morphs back and forth from Farrar, Pharo, Farra, Ferrar, Farrer, Ferrers, and Farrow, the name itself did not change, but the spelling of it depended upon the Scrivener The surname is found, in England, originally in those areas in which there were deposits of iron and thus an iron producing industry.
