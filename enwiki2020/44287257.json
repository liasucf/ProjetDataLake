After many obstacles and failures, he receives help from Hugo, Mandy, and Siu Tien, and finally begins his cellphone application company. Desperate to prove to his father that he can become just as successful as him, Mike prepares to confront his father on the business front, especially when it becomes apparent that his father wants to crush his ambitions because he isn't his biological son. On the other hand, Chiang Shing Tin's second son, Chiang Sing/Andy, begins to lose his status in the family because of his lack of capabilities. He has constant problems with his wife because he suspects her of having had an affair with his third brother, Chiang Tsun/Louie. Unbeknownst to everyone, Louie is actually gay and has been hiding in the closet for years. Through all these trials, Chiang Shing Tin's wife, Chau Ping, struggles to keep the family together, torn by her desire to help her biological son, Louie, rise to the helm and caring for her stepchildren, Mike and Andy. Midway, after Mandy breaks up with him due to his refusal to let her know him for who he truly is, Hugo loses it and decides to surrender to the cold-blooded, power-hungry sociopath that he really is. He kills Louie after the latter threatens to go to the police about a murder he knows Hugo committed. He even marries the Chiang family's only daughter, Abby, using her to get into the firm and snatch the position of chairman from an ailing Chiang Shing Tin who suffers two debilitating strokes. He also sleeps with Ivy, Chiang Shing Tin's mistress, and uses her to gain more footing in his unscrupulous plans to introduce a virtual currency that will replace physical cash. Eventually, Hugo goes after Mike, furious that the latter tried to slow down his plans when they had worked together earlier. He ends up trying to kill Mandy because he can't accept she no longer loves him and is instead in a relationship with Chau Kan (Chau Ping's brother and Mike's uncle). Instead, he ends up getting Mike's pregnant wife, Flora, killed. In the end, a mentally ill Andy stabs Hugo to death as the latter accepts an entrepreneurial award. Mike ends up taking over his father's company and revitalizing the business. ==Cast== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:cornflowerblue; color:white\" align=center |style=\"width:25%\"|Cast||style=\"width:25%\"|Role||Description |- | Wayne Lai \u9ece\u8000\u7965 || Chiang Yuen, Mike \u8523\u5143 || Adopted Son of Chiang Sing-Tin Fa-lai's first love Does not care about money; only does business out of interest Son of Chiang Sing-Tin's first wife |- |Raymond Wong Ho-yin \u9ec3\u6d69\u7136 || Hugo, Chung Hiu Yeung \u937e\u66c9\u967d || Chiang Yuen's business partner Has a relationship with Ting Man-Chi Major Villain |- |Nancy Wu \u80e1\u5b9a\u6b23 || Ting Man-Chi, Mandy (Ah Man) \u4e01\u6f2b\u59ff || Chiang Yuen's assistant Has relationship with Raymond Wong Later involved in a love triangle between Chung Hiu-Yeung/Hugo and Chiang Lai Love interest of Lee Chau Kan |- |Susanna Kwan \u95dc\u83ca\u82f1 || Lee Chau Ping \u674e\u79cb\u840d || Chiang Sing-Tin's second wife Chiang Tsun and Chiang Lai's mother Chiang Yuen and Chiang Sing's stepmother Not only has to keep her family together, but also withstand others who challenge the first wife position |- |Edwin Siu \u856d\u6b63\u6960 || Yuen Siu-Tin \u8881\u5c0f\u7530 || Thai boxer Friend of Chiang Yuen Later involved in a love triangle with Ma Siu-Ming and Chiang Lai Father of Ma Siu-Ming's unborn child |- | Power Chan \u9673\u570b\u90a6 || Lee Chau Kan \u674e\u79cb\u82b9 || Lee Chau Ping's younger brother Uncle of Chiang Yuen, Chiang Sing, Chiang Tsun and Chiang Lai Likes Ting Man-Chi |- |Raymond Cho \u66f9\u6c38\u5ec9 || Chiang Sing, Andy \u8523\u6607|| Chiang Sing-Tin's second son Younger brother of Chiang Yuen Older half-brother of Chiang Tsun and Chiang Lai Son of Chiang Sing-Tin's first wife Husband of Tong Ching |- |Jason Chan \u9673\u667a\u71ca || Chiang Tsun, Louie \u8523\u9032|| Chiang Sing-Tin's third son Younger half-brother of Chiang Yuen and Chiang Sing Older brother of Chiang Lai Son of Lee Chau Ping |- |Elliot Ngok \u5cb3\u83ef|| Chiang Sing-Tin \u8523\u627f\u5929|| Hong Kong's richest man Adopted father of Chiang Yuen Father of Chiang Sing, Chiang Tsun, Chiang Lai and Chiang Li Husband of Lee Chau Ping |- |Maggie Shiu \u90b5\u7f8e\u742a || Kwan Fa-lai, Flora \u95dc\u82b1\u62c9|| Chiang Yuen's first love Ko Hing's aunt and adoptive mother Wife of Sunny (deceased) |- |Yoyo Chen \u9673\u81ea\u7464 || Tong Ching \u6e6f\u6674 || Chiang Sing's wife Has hazy relationship with Chiang Tsun |- |Grace Chan \u9673\u51f1\u7433 || Chiang Lai, Abby \u8523\u52f5 || Chiang Sing-Tin's daughter Younger half-sister of Chiang Yuen and Chiang Sing Chiang Tsun's younger sister Daughter of Lee Chau Ping Later involved in a love triangle with Chung Hiu-Yeung/Hugo and Ting Man- Chi/Mandy Yuen Siu-Tin's love interest Falls in love with Hugo |- |Sisley Choi \u8521\u601d\u8c9d || Ma Siu-Ming \u99ac\u5c0f\u660e || In charge of a boxing club left by her father Later involved in a triangle relationship with Yuen Siu-Tin and Chiang Lai Pregnant with Yuen Siu-Tin's baby Miscarried in Episode 19 |- |Fred Cheng \u912d\u4fca\u5f18 || Ko Hing \u9ad8\u8208 || Fa-lai's autistic nephew and adopted son Likes to sing and play the violin |- |Ali Lee \u674e\u4f73\u82af || Yu Si Lam, Ivy \u4f59\u8a69\u7433 || Chiang Sing-Tin's mistress Chiang Li, Lily's mother Major Villain |} ==Viewership ratings== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:cornflowerblue; color:white\" align=\"center\" ||Week||Episodes||Date||Average Points||Peaking Points |- | 1 ||1 - 5 || November 3\u20137, 2014 || 24 || 26 |- | 2 ||6 - 10 || November 10\u201314, 2014 || 23 || 24 |- | 3 || 11\uff0d14 || November 17\u201321, 2014 || 24 || 26 |- | 4 || 15\uff0d19 || November 24\u201328, 2014 || 23 || 25 |- | 5 || 20\uff0d24 || December 1\u20135, 2014 || 22 || 24 |- | 6 || 25- 30 || December 8\u201314, 2014 || 25 || 31 |- |} ==External links== *K-TVB.net English Synopsis Category:TVB dramas Category:2014 Hong Kong television series endings ",
