Eighteen teams compete, with the winner going on to represent Meath in the Leinster Senior Club Football Championship. The championship starts with a group stage and then progresses to a knock out stage. Navan O'Mahonys were the defending champions after they defeated Donaghmore/Ashbourne in the previous years final, and they successfully defended their title, becoming the first team to manage that feat since Dunshaughlin's three-in-a-row between 2000-02. The Navan side defeated Na Fianna 0-13 to 1-8 on Bank Holiday Monday 26 October 2015 in Pairc Tailteann. This was the first time the final was held on a Monday. Former Meath player Gary O'Brien raised the Keegan Cup for the 20th time for O'Mahonys while goalkeeper Marcus Brennan claimed the 'Man of the Match' award. This was Ballinlough's return to the senior grade 8 years since relegation in 2007 after claiming the 2014 Meath Intermediate Football Championship title. The draw for the group stages of the championship were made on 9 February 2015 with the games commencing on the weekend of 10 April 2015.
