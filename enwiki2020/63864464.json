His Undocumented Migration Project includes more than 9000 objects, some of which are on display at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington D.C. From 2013 to 2017, he co-curated an exhibition of these artifacts and other materials collected by the Undocumented Migration Project in a show called State of Exception that was featured in multiple locations including the Museum of Contemporary Art in Detroit (MOCAD) and the New School in New York City.

His work has been described as a multidisciplinary approach to Latin America to US migration and involves ethnographic analysis of migrant stories, forensic science, and archaeological research. It has also been described as an \u201cintersection of physical geography, cultural geography, and archaeology,\u201d as he uses tools like GPS to document sites. He says that archaeology is \u201cstudying the past through material traces.\" We tend to think these must be ancient things\u201d and asks us to question, \u201cWhat happens if you think about the archaeology of the recent past, as recently as this morning in some cases\u201d? == Undocumented Migration Project (UMP) and Hostile Terrain 94 (HT94) == The Things They Carried: Undocumented Migration Project As Executive Director of the long-term Undocumented Migration Project (UMP) Inc., a 501(c)(3) that began in 2009, De Le\u00f3n uses fieldwork to \u201ccollect, catalogue, and interpret nearly 10,000 objects left in the desert by migrants making the treacherous, undocumented border crossing from Mexico into the United States\u201d and says these objects become artifacts. The UMP project has focused on the last 20 years, but broadened more recently in 2020 to include longer histories of migration, labor, and environmental changes centered on Arizona, which is a main area of undocumented crossings from Mexico; they will conduct interviews and collect oral histories. As part of UMP, De Le\u00f3n directs Hostile Terrain 94 (HT94), a participatory art project resulting in an exhibition of \u201c3,200 handwritten toe tags that represent migrants who have died trying to cross the Sonoran Desert of Arizona between the mid-1990s and 2019. These tags are geolocated on a wall map of the desert showing the exact locations where remains were found\u201d. HT94 was shown in the US and around the world, debuting a virtual exhibition on July 17, 2020. This exhibition is slated to be installed in 130 locations on six continents through the end of 2021.
