    "text": "Betty Stogs was a Cornishwoman in a folktale. She lived on moorland near Towednack, Cornwall, England. She had a six-month-old baby but was lazy and dissipated. The neglected baby was cared for by the fairies, who returned it clean and laid upon a bed of moss. The tale is a traditional one of the area; a warning to mothers to look after their children properly, lest the pixies take them. A beer is now named Betty Stogs after this character. With an ABV of 4.0% it is brewed by Skinner's Brewery in Truro and won the CAMRA prize for Champion Best Bitter in 2008. The beer is the subject of songs: \"Farewell to your wines and whiskies Your brandies and your grogs I\u2019d sail the world and back again For a pint of Betty Stogs\" ==References== Category:Cornish folklore Category:English beer brands ",
