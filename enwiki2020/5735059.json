In 1941, the United States Department of War commissioned the establishment of Umatilla Ordnance Depot in northern Umatilla County; it was later renamed Umatilla Army Depot and then Umatilla Chemical Depot. The town was named after the depot, and Ordnance post office was established in 1943. By the 1960s, Ordnance was no longer a community. ==See also== *List of ghost towns in Oregon ==References== == External links == * Historic photo of the Umatilla Ordnance Depot from the Oregon Historical Society * History of the depot from the Center for Columbia River History Category:Former populated places in Umatilla County, Oregon Category:Ghost towns in Oregon Category:1943 establishments in Oregon ",
