    "text": "Eric Charles Knowles (9 March 1896 \u2013 15 September 1978) was a first-class cricketer who played for Queensland from 1926 to 1928. When he was a 15-year- old schoolboy at Toowoomba Grammar School, Knowles represented Toowoomba against the touring MCC in 1911-12, opening the bowling and top-scoring in Toowoomba's first innings with 22 not out. He served with the First AIF in Egypt and France during the First World War, and was mentioned in despatches. He took up fruit-farming at Stanthorpe when he returned. In October 1919 he married Stella Hooper in Ipswich. After a few years he moved to Brisbane, playing with the Western Suburbs club, which he captained from 1926 to 1936, leading them to the premiership in 1931-32. His work allowed him only four appearances for Queensland. In 1926-27, Queensland's first season in the Sheffield Shield, he scored 40 and 144 in Queensland's victory over Victoria. His elder brother was Sir George Knowles. ==References== ==External links== * * Eric Knowles at CricketArchive Category:1896 births Category:1978 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Toowoomba Category:People educated at Toowoomba Grammar School Category:Australian cricketers Category:Queensland cricketers ",
