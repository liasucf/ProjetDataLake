The 2018 edition of the tournament was be held between 6 \u2013 28 October, and featured a new format from previous editions. The finals phase of the 2018 tournament was held in the Queensland city of the Gold Coast, from the 25 \u2013 28 October. QLD Blades won the tournament for a record tenth time after defeating NSW Waratahs 5\u20133 in the gold medal match. Tassie Tigers claimed the bronze medal after defeating the Canberra Lakers 1\u20130. ==Competition Format== Unlike previous editions of the Men's Australian Hockey League, the 2018 edition will include a very different format. Instead of the tournament being held at a single venue, the teams will play at least one home and away match during the pool stage, before converging on a singular venue for the Classification Round. The teams will be divided into two Pool A and Pool B, both consisting of four teams, with each team playing each other once. The teams will then progress to the Classification round, with each team playing a qualifying match, before progressing to either the fifth to eighth place playoffs, or the first to fourth place playoffs. ==Participating teams== * Canberra Lakers * NSW Waratahs * NT Stingers * QLD Blades * SA Hotshots * Tassie Tigers * VIC Vikings * WA Thundersticks ==Venues== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !
