    "text": "Russell Taylor \"Pops\" Smith (February 5, 1890, Ripley, Ohio \u2013 March 27, 1966, Los Angeles) was an American jazz trumpeter. He was the brother of Joe Smith. Smith learned alto horn as a child, and switched to trumpet when he was fourteen years old. He played in local bands as a teenager and relocated to New York City in 1910. By 1915 he was playing in London with Joe Jordan's orchestra. In the late 1910s and early 1920s he found work playing stage revues and in military bands. He became a member of Fletcher Henderson's band in 1925, remaining with Henderson intermittently until 1941; during that time he also played in the Blackbirds of 1928 revue and, in the mid-1930s, with Horace Henderson, Benny Carter, and Claude Hopkins. From 1941 to 1946 he played in Cab Calloway's group, then worked with Noble Sissle toward the end of the 1940s. He moved to California in the 1950s, where he lived the rest of his life; he was less active as a performer, but occasionally taught music. ==References== *\"Russell Smith\".
