    "text": "Sauna Youth is a London-based post punk band formed by ex-members of punk bands The Steal and Captain Everything in 2009. They have released three albums, Dreamlands (2012), Distractions (2015), and Deaths (2018), plus various singles. The current members of Sauna Youth also play in the band Monotony, an alter ego of sorts where they all switch instruments. The two bands released a split single on Upset The Rhythm in 2015. ==History== Sauna Youth formed in 2009 with members living between Brighton and London. The original lineup of vocalist Rich Phoenix (previously of Captain Everything and The Steal), guitarist Lindsay Corstorphine (previously of The Steal), bassist Christopher Murphy, and drummer Reza Mirehsan, made a demo tape titled Planet Sounds, then followed it up with their first single, the self-released \"Youth\" in 2010. The \"Mad Mind\" cassette came out that same year, with their second single \"Lists\" and a split with Ale Mania in 2011. That year Mirehsan left, Phoenix moved over to drums, and Jen Calleja joined on vocals and sampler. Their first full-length album was co-released by Faux Discx and Gringo Records in 2012. After a single in 2013, \"False Jesii Pt. 2,\" the band began work on their second album. During the sessions they decided to switch instruments and form a second band, Monotony. Before the album's release in June 2015, their new label Upset the Rhythm put out a split Sauna Youth/Monotony single that May. Sauna Youth have recorded several sessions for Marc Riley on his BBC 6 Music radio show from 2014 to 2016 (as well as one as Monotony). They also appeared as both incarnations on the made for iPlayer live music show he presented in 2015. In July 2018, the band announced their new album, Deaths, with first single \"Percentages\". It was released on 7 September that year, again via Upset The Rhythm. In advance of the album\u2019s release they toured the UK with Protomartyr in August, before which they also played the Visions Festival 2018 pre-party with Fucked Up in London. ==Discography== ===Albums=== *Dreamlands - Faux Discx/Gringo Records, 12\" LP, MP3 (2012) *Distractions - Upset The Rhythm, 12\" LP, MP3 (2015) *Deaths - Upset The Rhythm, 12\" LP, MP3 (2018) ===Singles and EPs=== *\"Youth\" - Self Released, 7\", MP3 (2010) *\"Mad Mind\" - Suplex Cassettes, Cassette, MP3 (2010) *\"Lists\" - Self Released, 7\", MP3 (2011) *\"False Jesii Pt.
