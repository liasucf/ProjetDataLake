    "text": "The nine-pin bowling World Championships was a biennial nine-pin bowling competition organized by the World Ninepin Bowling Association (WNBA NBC). The World Championships was started in 1953 and until 1959 took place every two years. The next one was held in 1962 with the assumption of alternating with the European Championships every two years. In 1966, this concept was abandoned and thereafter the championships were biennial until 2004. Since 2005, the competition has been divided. Team's are held in odd years, while Single's in even years. The following list shows when new events were added for the first time: *1953, individual and team events as first events. *1966, pair competitions were added. *1990, combination competitions were added. *1994, separation of team competition into two divisions A and B. *2004, sprint and mixed tandem competitions added. An individual event on a distance of 120 throws for the first time. == List of championships == {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:90%; ! Edition !! Year !! City !!
