This device, along with the Nokia 8 Sirocco, completes the lineup of Nokia-branded Android devices. The phone also has separately sold removable back covers marketed as Xpress-on, a trade-name that first appeared on the Nokia 5110. This was the first time the Xpress-on name was used since the Nokia Lumia 710 in 2012. ==Specifications== ===Hardware=== The Nokia 1 has a quad-core 1.1 GHz Cortex-A53 Mediatek MT6737M CPU with 1 GB of RAM and 8 GB of internal storage that can be expanded using a microSD card of up to 128 GB. The device also has a 4.5-inch IPS LCD display, a 5 MP rear camera with auto-focus and an LED flash, and a 2 MP front-facing camera. The 2150 mAh user-removable Li-Ion battery allows for up to 15 days of standby time and up to 9 hours of talk time. The smartphone's back covers are available in Warm Red, Dark Blue, and light blue colors. ===Software=== The Nokia 1 is shipped with Android 8.1 Oreo (Go edition), and gets continuous security updates every month for up to 3 years. In late June 2019, HMD began rolling out the Android 9 Pie (Go edition) for Nokia 1. The device is expected to get the Android 10 Go update by July 2020. == Reception == The Nokia 1 generally received mixed reviews. Sean Cameron of TechRadar praised the device's battery life, customisable back cover and durable design, while criticising its poor performance, dim screen and poor speaker. ==References== ==External links== * * https://www.nokia.com/phones/en_int/security-updates Category:Nokia Android smartphones Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2018 Category:Android (operating system) devices ",
