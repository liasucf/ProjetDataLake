It was previously named Lyc\u00e9e Florent-Schmitt but in 1996 a musical philosophy teacher from the school discovered pamphlets dating from the 1930s in which the namesake, Florent Schmitt, denounced German Jews and Israelite (Jewish) influence on music. Afterward there had been multiple attempts to change the school's name. () ==References== ==External links== * Lyc\u00e9e Alexandre Dumas Category:Lyc\u00e9es in Hauts-de-Seine ",
