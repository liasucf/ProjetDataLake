The film tells the story of brothers Clifford and Jeffrey Azize and their travels as they search for answers to the question, \"What does it mean to be human?\". Their friends Michael Campo and Matthew Sanchez participate in some of the travels. The film is divided into three sections, covering the experiences of Jeffrey and his friends in New York, Peru, and Ghana. The Human Experience is rated PG-13. ==Plot== The first experience follows Jeffrey and his brother Clifford Azize to the streets of The Big Apple, where the boys live with the homeless for a week in one of the coldest winters on record. The brothers are the children of divorced parents; they have not seen their father for 10 years. The Azize brothers look for hope and camaraderie among their homeless companions, while learning how to survive on the streets. During their second experience, the brothers join a group of surfers from Surf For The Cause traveling to Peru. There, they visit a hospital for abandoned children in the foothills of the Andes Mountains. The boys are surprised to find joy among the children and their caretakers despite serious medical problems. Throughout the story, the film features commentary from spiritual, artistic, and medical experts and philosophers, including William B. Hurlbut M.D.; Rabbi Simon Jacobson; Dr. Alveda King; and Rev. Richard Neuhaus (who was filmed before his death in January 2009). In their final experience, the brothers, along with their friends Michael Campo and Matthew Sanchez, go to Africa. Michael is on his way to visit a leper colony in rural Ghana. On their way to the colony, the boys meet victims of AIDS and their families. Once they reach the leper colony, they befriend lepers who are disfigured from the disease and have been exiled from their villages. At the end of the film, the boys return to their life in New York with a changed outlook and insight into the human condition. Also, at the end of the film, Jeffrey and Clifford have a surprise meeting with their father and are reunited with him. They have not seen each other for 10 years, but Jeffrey and Clifford still love their father and are able to reconcile with him. ==Production== The Human Experience is produced by Grassroots Films\u2019 Joseph Campo, Clifford Azize and Michael Campo.
