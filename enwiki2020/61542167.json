    "text": "The Democratic Coalition, also known as the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, is an American Super PAC founded in 2016 by Nathan Lerner, Scott Dworkin, and Jon Cooper for the purpose of opposing Donald Trump, with a fundraising goal of $20 million by Election Day. It was originally known as the Keep America Great PAC. In October 2016, the group filed a complaint with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation against Trump adviser Roger Stone for colluding with Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. They asked the FBI to look into connections between Stone, the Trump campaign, and the hacking of the Podesta emails. In 2017 and 2018, following Trump's election to the presidency in the 2016 United States presidential election, the group raised more than $754,000 and spent 0.3 percent of this amount supporting Democratic Party candidates or targeting Republican Party candidates, a percentage criticized as too low by several Democratic Party activists. Specifically, the Coalition and Dworkin personally have been accused of spending an unusually high percentage of the money on advertising to raise even more funds. ==See also== *Great America PAC == References == ==External links== * Category:United States political action committees Category:Organizations established in 2016 Category:Non-profit organizations based in New Jersey ",
