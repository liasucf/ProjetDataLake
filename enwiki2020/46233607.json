Following the dissolution of the Liga II team and disagreeing with the mayor's proposal to move ACS Reca\u0219 to Timi\u0219oara, South Lawn representatives, together with other fans of Politehnica Timi\u0219oara, decided to support the Liga V team, ASU Politehnica, which is the only now that they can identify as belonging to the right of the Polytechnic Institute, institution which appeared in 1921 as Politehnica Timi\u0219oara. Even if ASU Politehnica is not the legal successor of the former Divizia A and B team and even if not holding Polytechnics old track record, this is the only team that Poli supporters recognize as the one that can carry forward the spirit of the white and purple colours of Timi\u0219oara. ===County Leagues (2012\u20132015)=== On their first season after founding they reached the second place in 2012\u20132013 Liga V season and promoted to the next league, Liga IV Timi\u0219 County.

Next year they won the championship and qualified to the 2014\u201315 Liga IV promotion play-offs. In the same year they won a new established trophy named Football without owners, a friendly tournament of four teams without owners from Romania. The other teams were fan-owned phoenix clubs like ASU Poli named Arge\u0219 1953 Pite\u0219ti, FC Vaslui 2002 and the host LSS Voin\u021ba Sibiu. On 11 June, was announced that the team will play against Voin\u021ba Lupac, the champions of Liga IV Cara\u0219-Severin County, in the play-off promotion match for a place in the 2015\u201316 Liga III season. In the home match they beat them (5\u20131) and secured the promotion.

Historically, Poli has been the most prominent football club in Timi\u0219oara after 1945, playing consistently in either the first or the second tier of Romanian football. Local rivalries with CFR Timi\u0219oara and UM Timi\u0219oara were relevant until the early 2000s. Afterwards, the former was relegated to a semi-professional status in the lower leagues and the latter was dissolved in 2008. ASU Poli has many fans in Romania but also in other countries. The roots of the Poli ultras movement was found in 1995 when groups like Urban Guerilla, Gruppo Soarelui, Frenetic, Banatica, Drojdierii or Gruppo Autonomo Viola appear in the South End. Over the years, Poli developed rivalries with UTA Arad and Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti. The rivalry with UTA, also known as West Derby, stems from the natural competition between the cities of Timi\u0219oara and Arad, which are located close to each other and are the main cities in the region. Both Timi\u0219oara and Arad claim to be the first place where football was played in Romania, with Timi\u0219oara being the true first city in Romania to host a football game. Other rivalries are shared with CFR Cluj, Bihor Oradea, Steaua Bucure\u0219ti and Universitatea Craiova. Over the years, Politehnica Timi\u0219oara fans have established close friendships with the supporters of Rapid Bucure\u0219ti and the Nordkurve from Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. ==Honours== ===Domestic=== ====Leagues==== *Liga III **Winners (1): 2015\u201316 *Liga IV \u2013 Timi\u0219 County **Winners (1): 2014\u201315 **Runners-up (1): 2013\u201314 *Liga V \u2013 Timi\u0219 County **Runners-up (1): 2012\u201313 ====Cups==== *Cupa Rom\u00e2niei **Winners of Timi\u0219 County Round (1): 2013\u201314 ====Friendly==== *Football without Owners Tournament **Winners (1): 2015 *Dinu Instal Winter Cup **Winners (1): 2014 ====Other Performances==== *Round of 32 2016\u201317 Cupa Rom\u00e2niei ==Players== ===First team squad=== ===Out on loan=== ==Club Officials== ===Board of directors=== {| class=\"toccolours\" |- ! style=\"background:#653978;color:#ffffff;border:1px solid #ffffff;\" |Role ! style=\"background:#653978;color:#ffffff;border:1px solid #ffffff;\" |Name |- | Owner | Asocia\u021bia Suporterilor Timi\u0219oreni Druckeria Politehnica University of Timi\u0219oara |- | President | Viorel-Aurel \u0218erban |- | President Druckeria | Sebastian Novovi\u0107 |- | Vice President | Constantin Florescu |- | Board Members | Marius Adam Sa\u0219a Moza Radu Negru |- | General Manager | Dan Alexa |- | Counselor | Ion Timofte |- | Sporting Manager | Marius Cociu |- | Team Manager | Zolt\u00e1n Feh\u00e9r |- | Head of Youth Development | Iulian Prodana |- | Delegate | Ciprian Frean\u021b |- | Club Administrator | Alin Molcu\u021b |- | Press Officer | Emanuel Titus Ilie\u0219i |} ===Current technical staff=== {| class=\"toccolours\" |- ! style=\"background:#653978;color:#ffffff;border:1px solid #ffffff;\" |Role ! style=\"background:#653978;color:#ffffff;border:1px solid #ffffff;\" |Name |- | Manager | Octavian Benga |- | Assistant Manager | Antonio Foale |- | Goalkeeping Coach | Petru \u021aurca\u0219 |- | Fitness Coach | Miodrag Todorov |- | Club Doctors | Musab Al-Qatawneh |- | Masseurs | Marius Inciulescu Adrian Rus |- | Storeman | Adrian Miron |} ==League history== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\" !
