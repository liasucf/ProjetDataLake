Compared to his other races the pace was not nearly as fast and there wasn't as much of a pace meltdown most of the horses were clumped together in a group barely separated by less than 5 lengths. Except for Diamante Negro and one other horse. By the time the far turn went around the far turn, Diamante Negro made a huge move getting sent 7 wide around the turn and then opening up over 5 lengths by the finish line. After that, he would take a qualifying race for the final race of his 3-year-old year the Cl\u00e1sico del Caribe.
