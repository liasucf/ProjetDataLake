The city hall and seat of the municipal council lies on Kirkevej 7 (postal code 2791 Drag\u00f8r) in Store Magleby, which has enough space for such a large building. ==Geography== Drag\u00f8r, on the southeastern coast of the island of Amager, is located only 12 km from central Copenhagen. Together with the neighbouring village of Store Magleby, it forms a separate urban area with a population of 12,309 (1 January 2020).BY3: Population 1st January, by urban areas The Mobile Statbank from Statistics Denmark Drag\u00f8r has many well-preserved historical buildings. The old part of the town is a compact, picturesque maze of alleys with yellow-painted houses, red roofs, and cobblestone streets built in the traditional Danish style. Many of these buildings are hundreds of years old. Drag\u00f8r was a prosperous seafaring town in the latter half of the 19th century, and its charming harbour front is still in use. Today Drag\u00f8r is known, as the place where the \"happiest danes\" live. ==History== Drag\u00f8r was founded in the 12th century, and grew quickly as a fishing port. In 1370, the Hanseatic League was granted some trade privileges in the town. Drag\u00f8r continued to grow - as the home of one of the largest fishing fleets in the country and as a base for salting and processing fish. The first part of the name, Drag-, refers to drawing (dragging) boats ashore. The ending -\u00f8r is common in Scandinavian placenames and means a beach covered in sand or gravel. The area has a Dutch ancestry that is still much in evidence. In the early 16th century, King Christian II invited a group of farmers from the Netherlands \u2014 at the time a more agriculturally advanced nation than Denmark \u2014 to settle in the area and produce food for the royal household. Twenty-four families arrived. They and their descendants settled in the village of Store Magleby. Tensions between the Dutch farmers of the inland and the Danish fishermen and sailors at the coast are still detectable now, with a certain rivalry between citizens of Store Magleby and Drag\u00f8r. The Dutch peasants delivered vegetables to the Amagertorv market in Copenhagen. Among their many other achievements they were responsible for introducing the carrot to Denmark. Dutch and Low German were still spoken on Amager until the 19th century. Drag\u00f8r was made an independent parish 1 April 1954, before that being a part of Store Magleby parish. ==Attractions== * The Amager Museum, an open-air recreation of life in old rural Amager. * Drag\u00f8r Museum, a seafaring museum located at Drag\u00f8r harbour. * The Kastrupgaard Collection (Kastrupg\u00e5rdsamlingen) in nearby Kastrup.
