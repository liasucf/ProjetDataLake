He would go on to study at Universit\u00e9 Laval in other disciplines before reorienting back towards music in 1893 at 19 years old. From 1885 to 1898, he gave piano lessons and served as chapelmaster at the Saint-Charles-Borrom\u00e9e church in Joliette and led the local Ceclian Society. He established himself in Montreal, where he played in cabarets and worked in the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais. At the beginning of the 20th century, he began to venture into modern musical genres, taking a particular interest in the rise of ragtime in the United States. Collaborating with L\u00e9o- Ernest Ouimet, he began his career at Ouimetoscope, where he worked until becoming an accompanist at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Nouveaut\u00e9s. He composed many works; for the most part, he published in Le Passe-Temps. He most well-known piece is Raggity-Rag, which was reissued in 1967. Nicknamed \"The Canadian Strauss\", despite his talents, Lafreni\u00e8re lived a life of poverty and died during a bout with tuberculosis on January 4, 1912, aged only 37. Thanks to the work of Canadian pianist Mimi Blais(fr), Lafreni\u00e8re's music has regained popularity and is now regularly heard on Radio-Classique Montr\u00e9al. == Works == === Ragtime === * Hip!
