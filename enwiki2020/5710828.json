The original California Bungalow style buildings at the front of the property, built to house the station's technical staff and their families, were later used as accommodation for student firefighters. The original generator building housed the Teaching Centre, while the concrete blocks used to anchor the aerials' guy wires are still visible in multiple locations around the property. == Facilities == CFA Fiskville was used by CFA volunteers and staff for general training (both theory and practical), but had many other uses, including:CFA Fiskville Training Centre Page.

Some non-fire related training equipment included Urban Search & Rescue (USAR), 4WD course, and low ropes course. There were comprehensive theory facilities including seminar rooms, urban and rural TEWT (Tactical Exercise Without Troops) rooms, and other classroom training facilities. === Fire station === Fiskville was able to operate as a de facto tin shed fire station\u2014it had no boundaries, but responded when neighbouring brigades requested its appliances (if available). The centre ran one Type 4 SEM Scania, an Isuzu Type 3 Medium pumper (NSW Back), an Isuzu Type 3 Heavy pumper, and a 3.4D Tanker. The old 87 Hino was retired in August 2013. == Cancer cluster allegations == In December 2011, former CFA chief Brian Potter alleged that dozens of cases of cancer and other illnesses, including his own, were linked to the use of water contaminated by chemicals at the Fiskville site. Potter died, aged 70, in February 2014. In 2016, these claims were supported by a parliamentary inquiry established in 2014, concluding \"epidemiological evidence suggests that the contamination at Fiskville is likely to have caused cancer and other illnesses\" and \"People who have been harmed by unsafe training practices at Fiskville have a right to justice\".Fiskville report: Firefighters deserve 'justice' over toxic CFA training facility, report finds === Timeline === In initial response to Potter's claims, the Premier of Victoria, Ted Baillieu, announced an inquiry headed by Professor Rob Joy into the allegations. The report of Joy's inquiry was presented to the Country Fire Authority in late June 2012 and released shortly after with a response from the CFA. Joy concluded: \"We found that the current situation at Fiskville is that these legacy issues need to be further investigated but there's no good reason to conclude that they pose any significant risk to anyone on the site at present. Certainly further work needs to be done and CFA have agreed to do that.\"Fiskville Independent Report Summary (Part 1) YouTube video However, in November 2014 a Monash University study, Fiskville Firefighters' Health Study, showed statistically significant heightened cancer rates in those associated with the Fiskville facility. Fiskville Firefighters' Health Study Monash Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health, Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine On 21 January 2015, the newly elected Premier of Victoria, Daniel Andrews, and the Minister for Emergency Services, Jane Garrett, announced the findings of the Fiskville Cancer Study and issued a media release titled \"Cancer Cluster Found at Infamous Fire Facility\".Cluster Found at Infamous Fire Facility http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/cancer-cluster-found-at-infamous-fire-facility The media release stated \"Firefighters who worked at the Fiskville Training Facility have higher than expected rates of skin, testicular and brain cancer\" and that \"The Andrews Labor Government will ask the Parliamentary Inquiry into Fiskville to include the Monash report in its considerations. The Inquiry will also get to the bottom of how this occurred, how widespread the exposure was and who should be held responsible.\" On 3 March 2015, the site at Fiskville was closed indefinitely after tests on two mains water storage tanks found low level traces of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) from a banned firefighting foam. The chairman and chief executive of WorkSafe Victoria stood down at the request of the state government, due to concerns about the authority's handling of the contamination claims and its declaration that the site was safe. On 26 March 2015, the Victorian Government announced that the Fiskville facility would be closed permanently, after new toxicology tests revealed high levels of contamination on the site. In May 2016 the inquiry found that the firefighter's claims were justified, and that CFA management had knowingly used dangerous practices and been aware of the contamination for some time.CFA knew of Fiskville training centre contamination, inquiry finds The Age May 24th 2016 ==References== ==External links== *CFA website about contamination investigation Category:Fire and rescue services of Victoria (Australia) Category:Education in Victoria (Australia) Category:1971 establishments in Australia Category:2015 disestablishments in Australia Category:Firefighting academies ",
