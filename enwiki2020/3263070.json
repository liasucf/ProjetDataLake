    "text": "Speak Love is a 1983 studio album by the American jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald, accompanied by the jazz guitarist Joe Pass. It is the third of Fitzgerald's series of duets with Pass, following Take Love Easy (1973) and Fitzgerald and Pass... Again (1976) a later album, Easy Living, followed in 1986. The title of the album refers to the first line of the opening song on the album, \"Speak Low\", a quotation from Much Ado About Nothing. ==Reception== Writing for Allmusic, music critic Scott Yanow wrote of the album \"...the setting was perhaps too intimate for what she had left. Fitzgerald's phrasing remained a joy despite the limited range, but there are many more significant records by the singer than this CD reissue despite touching versions of \"Comes Love\", \"There's No You\" and \"Gone with the Wind\".\" ==Track listing== #\"Speak Low\" (Ogden Nash, Kurt Weill) \u2013 4:13 #\"Comes Love\" (Lew Brown, Sam H.
