She finished her studies with a PhD and Masters in Cinematography and Audiovisual Research, and her doctorate thesis discussed \"The Notion of First Film in Europe.\" == Career == === Early career === Before her career in film, Alnoy had a brief career as a dancer. After she directed Quand Mon Doigt Par M\u00e9garde (1993) Alnoy began working as a script writer for the National Center of Cinema.

It has two titles in English, She's One of Us and For She's a Jolly Good Fellow. The original title idea was L'Idiote. Elle est des N\u00f4tres follows the story of Christine Blanc (Sasha Andr\u00e8s) as she works at a temp agency. Her career and social life have fallen into a standstill and Blanc has great difficulty with social interactions. The film portrays her as a naive, almost idiotic character. It is only once she murders her boss, Patricia (Catherine Mouchet) that her life takes a turn and she lands a long-term contract, has friends, and is generally successful. However the investigation and guilt haunt her and Blanc inevitably hands herself over to the police. The film covers themes around alienation experienced by workers, particularly female employees, in a modern, capitalist society and the feelings of invisibility that result.
