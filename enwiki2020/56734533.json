He became a Commander in 2012 and is currently the highest ranking openly gay employee in the department. === Sheriff candidacy === Dave Myers announced his run for San Diego County Sheriff in February 2017 against his boss and 9-year-incumbent, Bill Gore. If elected, Myers would have been the first openly gay San Diego County Sheriff. Myers claimed to have experienced several instances of retaliation at work due to his candidacy. During his run, Myers said the department does not respond well to community issues and criticized Gore's handling of important cases. Myers stated there is a lack of diversity in the force, and believes there needs to be more LGBT, women and minorities serving in the San Diego Sheriff Department. Myers wanted to prohibit the shackling of pregnant inmates while they give birth. He wanted the department to focus on rehabilitation instead of incarceration for misdemeanors and low level drug offenses. Unlike Sheriff Gore, Myers has supported California's cannabis laws, citing the fact that 60% of San Diego residents voted to legalize cannabis in 2016. Myers called for greater transparency in the Sheriff's department and wanted to deploy body cameras for the entire San Diego police department so that videos of important incidents could be made available to the public within 24 hours. Gore canceled a debate with Myers due to a scheduling conflict in March 2018. Gore stated he was unable to debate Myers due to laws limiting his ability to talk about employee conduct. In April 2018, Gore said during an interview that he used to be friends with Myers but now wished he could fire him. On June 5, 2018, Myers lost with 43.4% of the vote to Gore's 56.4%. == References == Category:American deputy sheriffs Category:People from San Diego County, California Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Gay men ",
