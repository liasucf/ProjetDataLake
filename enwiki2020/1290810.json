    "text": "H\u00f6xter () is a town in eastern North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany on the left bank of the river Weser, 52 km north of Kassel in the centre of the Weser Uplands. The main town's population is around 15,000, and with outlying centres, about 30,000. It is the seat of the H\u00f6xter district. == Geography == === Subdivisions === As part of North Rhine-Westphalia's municipal reforms, the collective municipality of H\u00f6xter came into being on 1 January 1970, formed out of the eleven communities of the former Amt of H\u00f6xter-Land, the main town, and the community of Bruchhausen from the former Amt of Beverungen. The communities in question voluntarily merged to pool their resources and bring about a unified administration. These constituent communities are: *Albaxen *Bosseborn *B\u00f6dexen *Brenkhausen *Bruchhausen *F\u00fcrstenau *Godelheim *L\u00fcchtringen *L\u00fctmarsen *Ottbergen *Ovenhausen *Stahle == History == H\u00f6xter (Latin Huxaria) in the time of Charlemagne was a villa regia, and was the scene of a battle between his forces and the Saxons. Under the protection of the Abbey of Corvey it gradually increased in prosperity, and became the chief town of the principality of Corvey. Later it asserted its independence and joined the Hanseatic League.Kampschulte, Chronik der Stadt H\u00f6xter (H\u00f6xter, 1872) H\u00f6xter was located on the important long distance trade-route known as Hellweg. Rivalry with Corvey Abbey and the nearby town known as Corvey increased and in 1265, the burghers of H\u00f6xter allied themselves with the Bishop of Paderborn. Their troops destroyed the town of Corvey and damaged the abbey. The town never recovered and over the following decades reverted to a small village. This event also marked the beginning of the long period of decline of the abbey. H\u00f6xter suffered severely during the Thirty Years' War. In 1634, Imperial troops laid siege to the town in what became known as the Blutbad von H\u00f6xter (massacre of H\u00f6xter). After the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 it was united with Brunswick; in 1802 it passed to Nassau and in 1807 to the Kingdom of Westphalia, after the dismemberment of which, in 1814, it came into the possession of Prussia.Kampschulte, Chronik der Stadt H\u00f6xter (H\u00f6xter, 1872) In 2005, an explosion within a house in the historic town centre damaged the town hall and many other significant buildings and resulted in three deaths. Work has started on the rebuilding of the damaged area but is expected to continue for many years. === Albaxen === Albaxen had its first documentary mention, under the name Albachtessen, on the occasion of the neighbouring Corvey Abbey's founding in 822, and by 900 it was already known by its current name. The Albaxen parish church was likewise first mentioned in the 9th century. The Tonenburg, a mediaeval building complex near Albaxen \u2013 not truly a castle as the name suggests \u2013 was built in 1350 by Corvey Abbey. === L\u00fcchtringen === In 854, L\u00fcchtringen was first mentioned under the name Lutringi (12 different spellings, including Luhtringi and Luchtringi) in Corvey Abbey's annals and beginning in 1230 it belonged to the fourth archdeaconate of H\u00f6xter-Corvey of the Bishopric of Paderborn. Before it became Prussian in 1813, L\u00fcchtringen belonged to the Principality of Orange-Nassau in Fulda from 1803. In 1970, L\u00fcchtringen lost its independence and became a constituent community of H\u00f6xter.L\u00fcchtringen \u2013 Geschichte einer Ortschaft, published by Heimat- und Verkehrsverein e. V. L\u00fcchtringen, first edition, 1998 L\u00fcchtringen is North Rhine-Westphalia's easternmost community. == Economy == The town's main manufactured products are linen, cotton, cement and gutta- percha latex, and there is also a considerable shipping trade.
