He was educated at Rossall School, an independent school for boys near the town of Fleetwood in Lancashire, and won a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, CambridgeEphraim Katz The Macmillan International Film Encyclopedia, 1998, London: Macmillan, p585 but was sent down (expelled).\"Hamer, Robert (1911-63)\", BFI screenonline websiteKidderminster Civic Society Newsletter Another Famous Son of Kidderminster February 2011 p1 suggests that he was suspended for homosexual activities but did eventually graduate He began his film career in 1934 as a cutting room assistant, and from 1935 worked as a film editor involved with such films as Hitchcock's Jamaica Inn (1939) co-produced by Charles Laughton. At the end of the 1930s, he worked on documentaries for the GPO Film Unit.Brian McFarlane The Encyclopedia of British Film, 2003, London: BFI/Methuen, p281-82 When his boss at the GPO, Alberto Cavalcanti, moved to Ealing Studios, Hamer was invited to join him there. He gained some experience as a director by substituting for colleagues and contributed the 'haunted mirror' sequence to Dead of Night (1945). He followed this with the three Ealing films under his own name for which he is best remembered: Pink String and Sealing Wax (1946), It Always Rains on Sunday (1947),John Patterson \"There's more to Robert Hamer than Kind Hearts And Coronets\", The Guardian, 19 October 2012 both featuring Googie Withers, and Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), with Dennis Price and Alec Guinness. Hamer was an alcoholic, who by the time of his last film as director, School for Scoundrels (1960) was \"often battling terrifying DT hallucinations\" (i.e. alcohol withdrawal symptoms, occurring only in patients with a history of alcoholism). BFI Screenonline writes that Hamer was \"a recovering alcoholic\" and that \"he fell off the wagon during production [of School For Scoundrels], was sacked on the spot ... and would never work in the industry again.\" In actual fact, although he never directed again, he did contribute to two more film screenplays before he died. Hamer was also homosexual in an era when it was illegal in the UK. He died of pneumonia at the age of 52 at St Thomas's Hospital in London, and is buried at Llandegley. According to film critic David Thomson, Hamer's career \"now looks like the most serious miscarriage of talent in the postwar British cinema\".David Thomson The New Biographical Dictionary of Cinema, 2002, London: Little, Brown, p.367 ==Filmography== *Vessel of Wrath (1938) - editor *St. Martin's Lane (1938) - editor *Jamaica Inn (1939) - editor *French Communique (1940) (documentary short) - editor *Turned Out Nice Again (1941) - editor *Ships with Wings (1941) - editor *The Foreman Went to France (1942) - editor *My Learned Friend (1943) - associate producer * San Demetrio London (1943) - director (uncredited), producer, writer *While Nero Fiddled (1944) - lyrics * Dead of Night (1945) - director of segment \"The Haunted Mirror\" * Pink String and Sealing Wax (1946) - director, writer * The Loves of Joanna Godden (1947) - director (uncredited) * It Always Rains on Sunday (1947) - director, writer * Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949) - director, writer * The Spider and the Fly (1949) - director * His Excellency (1952) - director, writer * The Long Memory (1952) - director, writer * Father Brown (1954) - director, writer * To Paris With Love (1955) - director *Rowlandson's England (1955) (documentary short) - writer *ITV Opening Night at the Guildhall (1955) - play \"Private Lives\" - director *ITV Play of the Week (1955) - \"A Month in the Country\" - director, adaptation *ITV Play of the Week (1955) - \"The Green of the Year\" - director, adaptation * The Scapegoat (1959) - director, writer * School for Scoundrels (1960) - director *55 Days at Peking (1963) - additional dialogue *They All Died Laughing (1964) - writer ==References== ==External links== * oxforddnb: Hamer, Robert James 1911-1963 film Director * British Film Institute: Screen online * * Kind Hearts and Coronets: 60th anniversary of a classic Category:1911 births Category:1963 deaths Category:Alumni of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge Category:English film directors Category:English screenwriters Category:English male screenwriters Category:LGBT directors Category:People educated at Rossall School Category:People from Kidderminster Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:20th-century British screenwriters ",
