Yaesu FT-818 With internal battery pack, on board keyer, its all mode/all band capability and flexible antenna, the set is particularly well suited for portable use. Yaesu FT-818 Operating Manual ==Technical description== The FT-818 incorporates all the many basic and attractive features of the ever-popular FT-817ND while providing upgrades desired by many existing owners. The FT-818 provides 6W of solid output power with an external DC power source. The supplied Ni-MH battery pack (SBR-32MH) has been upgraded to now provide larger battery capacity - 9.6v/ 1900mAh. The recent launch of several new satellites is a certain indicator that the large global community of satellite enthusiast are going to be very delighted to learn that the FT-818 includes a Built-in TCXO-9 oscillator that gives the FT-818 fantastic frequency stability (\u00b10.5ppm). ===Technical Specifications=== *RX Freq coverage: 100 kHz-30 MHz, 50 MHz-54 MHz, 76 MHz-154 MHz, 420 MHz-470 MHz *TX Freq coverage: 160 - 6 Meters, 2 Meters, 70 Centimeters (Amateur bands only), 5.1675 MHz Alaskan Emergency Frequency (USA only) *Power consumption: 13.8 V DC @ transmit 2.7A, @ receive 450mA. *Operating voltage range: within 8.0 - 16.0V (AA alkaline batteries: 12.0V; Ni-MH battery: 9.6V) *Tuning steps: 100 Hz AM, FM; 10 Hz SSB, CW *Dimensions: 135 x 38 x 165 mm *Weight appx.: 900g *Emission: CW, SSB, AM, FM, Digital mode *Power output: 6W (SSB,CW,FM), 2W (AM, carrier) @ 13.8V *Carrier suppression: better than 40 dB below rated output *Opp. sideband suppression: better than 50 dB below peak output *Spurious Radiation: \u201350 dB (1.8-29.7 MHz) \u201360 dB (50/144/430 MHz) *Transmitter freq response: 400 \u2013 2600 Hz (-6 dB) *Stability: \u00b10.5 ppm *Ant output impedance: 50 Ohms unbalanced (front BNC connector, rear UHF (SO-239) connector) *Microphone output impedance: 200-10k Ohms (Nominal: 600 Ohms) *Image rejection: HF/50 MHz: 70 dB, 144/430 MHz: 60 dB *IF rejection: 60 dB *Selectivity: -6 dB 2.2 kHz, -60 dB 4.5 kHz *Audio output: 1 W @ 10% THD, 8 Ohms == References == == External links == * FT-818 Reviews Category:Amateur radio transceivers ",
