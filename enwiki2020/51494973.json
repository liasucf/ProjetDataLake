    "text": "The Vatican announced the creation of the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development (Dicasterium ad integram humanam progressionem fovendam in Latin) on 31 August 2016 and it became effective 1 January 2017. Cardinal Peter K. A. Turkson was named its first prefect. The Prefect is to be assisted by a Secretary and at least one Undersecretary. ==Description== This dicastery of the Roman Curia combined the work of four Pontifical Councils established following the Second Vatican Council: Justice and Peace, Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People, Pastoral Assistance to Health Care Workers, and Cor Unum. Pope Francis has given it responsibility for \"issues regarding migrants, those in need, the sick, the excluded and marginalized, the imprisoned and the unemployed, as well as victims of armed conflict, natural disasters, and all forms of slavery and torture\". On 16 June 2017 the Pope named Bruno Marie Duff\u00e9, a French professor with long experience in human rights and relief work, the dicastery's Secretary. Fr. Nicola Riccardi and Msgr. Segundo Tejado Mu\u00f1oz were named undersecretaries, on 8 July 2017. The Pope announced that \"temporarily\" he would personally direct the special Migrants and Refugees Section as a part of the Dicastery. He named the Canadian Jesuit Fr. Michael Czerny (later cardinal) and the Italian Scalabrinian Fr. Fabio Baggio to serve as undersecretaries for issues related to refugees and migrants. ==Mission and Activities== From the Statutes of the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development: ==References== == External links == * Apostolic Letter Humanam progressionem from the Holy See official website * Statutes of the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development from the Holy See official website * Official Website http://www.humandevelopment.va/en.html * Official Twitter Account @VaticanIHD * Youtube Channel Vatican IHD *Official Website of the Migrants & Refugees Section https://migrants-refugees.va/ Category:2016 establishments in Vatican City Category:2017 in Vatican City Category:Dicasteries Category:Christian organizations established in 2016 ",
