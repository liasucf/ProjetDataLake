    "text": "The St. Paul Rangers were a minor professional ice hockey team based in Saint Paul, Minnesota. They were one of the original five teams of the Central Professional Hockey League. They were an affiliate of the National Hockey League's New York Rangers. Their name was changed to the Minnesota Rangers in 1965 after the neighbouring city of Minneapolis lost its Central League team. The Rangers, though, continued to play in St. Paul. In 1966 the Rangers moved their farm team to Omaha, Nebraska in anticipation of the debut of the NHL's Minnesota North Stars in 1967. The Rangers won the Adams Cup in 1964-65. == Season-by-season record == Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalties in minutes {| cellpadding=5 |- bgcolor=\"#dddddd\" |Season || GP || W || L || T || Pts|| GF || GA || PIM || Finish || Playoffs |- |1963\u201364 || 72 || 38 || 30 || 4 || 80 || 259 || 230 || N/A || 2nd || Lost Final |-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |1964\u201365|| 70 || 41 || 23 ||6 || 88 || 281 || 223 || N/A || 1st || Won Adams Cup |- |1965\u201366 || 74 || 34 || 29 || 11 || 79 || 229 || 197 || N/A || 1st|| Lost Semi Final |- bgcolor=\"#dddddd\" | Totals || 216 || 113 || 82 || 21 || 77 || 769 || 650 || N/A |} ==References== Category:Central Professional Hockey League teams Category:1963 establishments in Minnesota Category:1966 disestablishments in Minnesota Category:Ice hockey clubs established in 1963 Category:Ice hockey clubs disestablished in 1966 Category:Defunct ice hockey teams in Minnesota ",
