    "text": "The Amazing Race 27 was the twenty-seventh installment of the American reality television show The Amazing Race. It featured eleven teams of two, with each team centered on a pre-existing relationship between the cast members such as marriage, dating, or best friends. Teams competed in a race around the world for a grand prize. This season premiered on September 25, 2015. Dating news reporters Kelsey Gerckens and Joey Buttitta were the winners of this season. ==Production and filming== ===Development=== Venice Beach in Los Angeles. Similar to The Amazing Race 25, the show's Twitter page announced an open start at Venice Beach in Los Angeles, California and invited fans to join in sending the new teams off on their Race on June 22, 2015. The open start revealed that teams would head to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This season covered across five continents and ten countries, including visits to Argentina, Zambia, France, the Netherlands, Poland, India, the Chinese special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau and a first-time visit to Zimbabwe. During the Speed Bump in the ninth leg, Tanner and Josh had to complete the Roadblock challenge, one after the other, marking the first time since the introduction of the Speed Bump wherein no Speed Bump boards existed throughout the racecourse. This was also the first time since the introduction of the U-Turn that three U-Turns were used, unlike the usual two U-Turns in previous seasons. The Race also featured both a Double U-Turn and a single U-Turn for the first time on the same racecourse, with the single U-Turn board making its first appearance since Season 16. It was also the first time that a U-Turn board was placed at the Detour decision point, before the Detour itself. Although Fitbit and Travelocity continued sponsoring the show, Ford discontinued their sponsorship for this season. This season was, therefore, the first American edition, or any International version, with no production- provided vehicles to be driven by the racers since The Amazing Race's inception in 2001. This also meant that teams had to use public transportation such as a taxi to get to the airport in the first leg. Also in the season, Phil doesn't introduce the name of the teams for the first time in the series; instead, the teams introduce their lifestyle. Starting with the fifth episode, episodes began with a shortened intro. ===Casting=== The cast included TMZ editor Kelly Berning and post production supervisor Shevonne Sullivan, former New York Jets cheerleaders Tiffany Chantell Torres and Krista DeBono, former America's Best Dance Crew contestants Ernest \"E-Knock\" Phillips and Jayjion \"Jin Lao\" Greer, Justin Scheman and Diana Bishop who are known for their viral \"Amazing Race\" proposal video, and reporters Kelsey Gerckens and Joey Buttitta from KEYT-TV. ====Future appearances==== After the season aired, winners Kelsey & Joey got engaged during their interview on Home and Family, and eventually married on August 25, 2017. On January 22, 2020, they both appeared on an episode of CBS's Let's Make a Deal, which was taped on July 13, 2019 while Kelsey was pregnant with their son, and won $1,000. On May 25, 2016, Kelsey & Joey and Tiffany & Krista appeared on an Amazing Race-themed The Price is Right primetime special. On November 1, 2017, Krista DeBono appeared as the Pit Stop greeter for Leg 2 of HaMerotz LaMillion 6, the Israeli version of The Amazing Race, at Times Square in New York City. Justin & Diana appeared on Season 30 in attendance at the Starting Line. On March 1, 2020, Alex Manard appeared on an episode of Discovery Channel's Naked and Afraid and lasted the full 21 days in the Amazon rainforest of Yasuni, Ecuador. ==Results== The following teams participated in the 27th season of The Amazing Race.

If placed next to a leg number, this indicates the Fast Forward was available but not used. *A indicates that the team decided to use the first Express Pass on that leg. A indicates the team had previously been given the second Express Pass and used it on that leg. *An _underlined_ leg number indicates that there was no mandatory rest period at the Pit Stop and all teams were ordered to continue racing. An _underlined_ team placement indicates that the team came in last on a \"continue racing\" leg and was ordered to continue racing. *A or a indicates that the team chose to use one of the two U-Turns in a Double U-Turn; or indicates the team who received it; indicates that the team was U-Turned, but they used the second U-Turn on another team; and around a leg number indicates that the Double U-Turn was available for that leg but not used. *An team's placement indicates that the team came in last on a non-elimination leg and had to perform a Speed Bump during the next leg of the Race. # Justin & Diana attempted to do the Fast Forward on Leg 1, but due to high wind speeds the task was deemed unsafe until conditions improved. As a result, no team claimed the Fast Forward. # Kelly & Shevonne completed the Detour after 3 hours and 45 minutes; however, they never made it to the Pit Stop. After all the other teams had already checked in at the Pit Stop, Phil came to the Copacabana Beach to inform them of their elimination. # Denise & James Earl initially arrived 5th, but were issued a 30-minute penalty after Denise verbally helped her son during the Roadblock. Logan & Chris checked-in during their penalty time, dropping Denise & James Earl to 6th. # Tanner & Josh used their Express Pass to bypass the Roadblock on Leg 4. Before using the Express Pass, Josh elected to perform the Roadblock; this is reflected in the total Roadblock count.https://twitter.com/JoshMAhern/status/656149690296070144 When Tanner & Josh arrived 2nd at the Pit Stop, Phil ordered all teams to continue racing and they were required to give the Express Pass to another team on the next leg of the Race. They had to hand it to Phil immediately at the Pit Stop and tell him which team should have it. # Tiffany & Krista used their U-Turn on Justin & Diana; however, they had already passed the U-Turn point and were therefore unaffected by it. # Denise & James Earl used the Express Pass given to them by Tanner & Josh to bypass the Detour on Leg 5. # For their Speed Bump in Leg 9, Tanner & Josh both had to individually complete the Roadblock. Since Tanner opted to do the Roadblock before finding out they both had to do the Roadblock, only Tanner's performance is reflected in their total Roadblock count. # Justin & Diana initially arrived 3rd, but were issued a 55-minute penalty (30-minute standard penalty plus 25-minutes for time gained) for taking a ferry from Kowloon (Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal) instead of the Hong Kong\u2013Macau Ferry Terminal, as the clue specifically instructed. This did not affect their placement. ==Episode title quotes== Episode titles are often taken from quotes made by the racers. #\"A Little Too Much Beefcake\" \u2013 Justin #\"Get in There and Think Like a Dog\" \u2013 Justin #\"Where My Dogs At?\" \u2013 Ernest #\"Good Old Fashioned Spit in the Face\" \u2013 Josh #\"King of the Jungle\" \u2013 Joey #\"My Tongue Doesn't Even Twist That Way\" \u2013 Justin #\"Full Speed Ahead, Captain!\" \u2013 Justin #\"Krakow, I'm Gonna Get You\" \u2013 Tanner #\"It's Always the Quiet Ones\" \u2013 Krista #\"Bring the Fun, Baby!\" \u2013 Justin #\"It's Not Easy Beating Green\" \u2013 Krista #\"We Got a Chance, Baby!\" \u2013 Justin ==Prizes== The prize for each leg was awarded to the first place team for that leg.
