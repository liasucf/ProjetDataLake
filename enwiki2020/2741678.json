(I.N.D.U.C.K.S.) or Inducks is a freely available database aiming to index all Disney Universe comics ever printed in the world. It is an international projectAs of January 2008, 26 contributors have provided more than 1,000 indexes, see the full list: The Inducks Disney Comics database: Indexers. which provides indexes of around 130,000 Disney comic publications worldwide.As of July 30, 2011, see the statistics at Inducks. It is distributed with its own licence.H. Fluks, F. Stajano, Inducks Licence Version 4B (a kind of permissive, \"copyleft\" \"free\" licence). ==Origin== Efforts to catalog Disney comic stories on a large scale date from the late 1970s and early 1980s. Among the most important works are an index of Disney comics published in Denmark,. a list of stories produced in Italy,. a list of American daily strips and Sunday pages,. an index of American Dell Disney comics and a Carl Barks index. (published earlier in a shorter form in the fanzine Funnyworld in the 1970s). All these lists include artists and writer credits that were previously unknown. In August 1992, Per Starb\u00e4ck (from Sweden) created the Disney Comics Mailing List.Commonly called the DCML. Members soon contributed lists of Disney comics and gave references for printed indexes. In May 1994, expanding on information exchanged on the mailing list, Harry Fluks (from the Netherlands) created a database to organize comic indexes, and called it the Disney Comics Database.Interviews of H. Fluks in the fanzines Ankkalinnan Pamaus 2000-02 (online English version ), in DDF(R)appet 5, 2004 and on the Web site of the Danish Donaldist Society , 2005. In 1999, a German member suggested the name Inducks as a cross between \"index\" and \"duck\" (for Donald Duck). It was playfully written I.N.D.U.C.K.S. to resemble acronyms seen in Junior Woodchucks comics.The word Inducks is a combination of Index and Ducks. Brix Lichtenberg came up with this name as a replacement for the (more boring) name Disney comics Database. He intended it to be an abbreviation (I.N.D.U.C.K.S.) like the ranks in the Junior Woodchuck stories, but we haven't figured out yet what it is supposed to mean ... in Ankkalinnan Pamaus 2000-02 . Several meanings have been proposed, including \"Internet Database for Uncle Walt's Comics and Stories\", \"International Network for Disney Universal Comic Knowledge and Sources\",From the Bolderbast , an Inducks website. up to 2008 when International Network of Disney-Universe Comic Knowers and Sources was selected. Over the years, a Web search interface was introduced, later replaced by a second search engine, COA,A precise time- frame is as follows (from messages in the Disney comics mailing list): Disney comics indexes were exchanged as early as 1992, e.g., September 11; the first mention of the Disney comics database (DcD) is from April 18, 1994; its first public release is on May 25, 1994; the first mention of a web search program is from March 22, 1995; the first mention of Inducks is from February 9, 1999; the first mention of the COA search engine on the Disney comics mailing list is from April 9, 2001 (see archived copy here). in 2001. ==Data details== The Inducks database lists publications, stories, characters and creators which are cross-referenced. Each story is given a unique \"storycode\"Details at Inducks . so that reprints (often from all over the world) may be found for any story. A large number of Disney comics publications are indexed for the following countries: Australia, Brazil, Denmark, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden and United States. Among countries with a significant Disney comics tradition, indexes for Mexico, United Kingdom and (ex-)Yugoslavia are still very incomplete.As of January 2008 - figures from Inducks.

Thanks to contacts with creators,The Brazilian \"branch\" of Inducks lists about 30 authors who provide information ; see also the biographical notice of comic writer Leonardo Gori or the \"book work\" of archivist and editor David Gerstein. it provides credits to anonymous (or wrongly-credited) stories. In particular, most Disney comics were not given credits until the 1980s or 1990s. It also contains information about unpublished Disney comics stories.As of January 2008, about 2,000 shelved stories are listed.
