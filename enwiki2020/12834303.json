He is reputed to have claimed at the outset that he would complete construction in half the time it took Emperor Sh\u014dmu to complete the Great Buddha of Nara. The project during Emperor Shom\u016b's reign took ten years. Hideyoshi would complete the initial phase of his project in only three years.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard A.B. (1956). Kyoto: the Old Capital of Japan, p. 290-294. The architects for this project were Nakamura Masakiyo and Heinouchi Yoshimasa.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 225. ==History== * Tensh\u014d 14, in the 10th month (1586): With the approval of Emperor Go-Y\u014dzei, Hideyoshi ordered land-surveys as he prepared to begin construction of a Daibutsu-ji in Heian-ky\u014d.Ponsonby- Frane, p. 290. * Tensh\u014d 16 (1588): Construction on the temple commenced,Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). Annales des empereurs du japon, p. 404 n1. and the work moved forward in an area where the Kyoto National Museum now stands. Constructed in Tensho 16 (1588), this stone structure once had a tiled-roofed and mud walls, with pillars marking the walls of the Daibutsu- den's central space.Kyoto National Museum website. \u2013 see example of the iron rings used to hold together and re-inforce columns in the great hall of the Daibutsu-den * Tensh\u014d 16 (1588):Hideyoshi's sword hunt edict required that all weapons must be relinquished by non-samurai\u2014including long swords, short swords, bows, spears and firearms; and the edict explained that the metal was to be melted down into nails and clamps to be used in creating a grand statue of Buddha at H\u014dk\u014d-ji, thus earning merit in this life and the next.Hall, John, ed. (1988). The Cambridge History of Japan, Vol. 4: Asao Naohiro, \"The sixteenth century unification,\" pp.49\u201350. * Tensh\u014d 17, in the 10th month (1589): The priest Kokei of Daitoku-ji was nominated founder of the new temple; and Sh\u014dk\u014din-no-Miya K\u014di H\u014dshinn\u014d conducted the dedication ceremony with a thousand priests in attendance.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 291. * Bunroku 4 (1595): Hideyoshi summons a thousand priests from 8 Buddhist sects to mass service at H\u014dk\u014d-ji in honor of his ancestors.\u2013 Nichiren sect priests decline to participate * Bunroku 5 (August 14, 1596): An earthquake destroyed both the image of the buddha and the completed Daibutsu-den. * Keich\u014d 3 (September 17, 1598): Work was begun to replace the temporary structure which was built after the Bunroku earthquake, and the borrowed statue of Buddha was returned to Zenk\u014d-ji as work began on reconstructing a new large statue of the buddha as well; but this work was halted the following month when Hideyoshi died at the age of 63 on the 18th day of the 8th month of Keich\u014d 3.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 291; Titsingh, p. 405. * Keich\u014d 7 (January 15, 1602): A fire at the H\u014dk\u014d-ji temple complex in Kyoto was caused by careless workmen; and the great image of the buddha and the structure housing the statue, the Daibutsu-den, were both consumed by the flames.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 290; Titsingh, p. 409. Temple bell at H\u014dk\u014d-ji. Inscription on bell at H\u014dk\u014d-ji * Keich\u014d 15 (November 15, 1610): Toyotomi Hideyori decided to sponsor work which had begun to rebuild the H\u014dk\u014d- ji in line with the plans which his father had supported; and this would include recreating the great statue of the buddha in bronze to replace the wooden image which had been burned. At this time, Hideyori also decided to order a great bell cast in bronze.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 292; Titsingh, p. 409. * Keich\u014d 19 (August 24, 1614): A new bronze bell for the H\u014dk\u014d-ji was cast successfully; \u2013 see 19th-century photo of H\u014dk\u014d-ji bell\u2013 see old photo of bell and dedication ceremonies were scheduled, but at the last minute, Ieyasu forbade the ceremonies to take place. ::\"[T]he tablet over the Daibatsu-den and the bell bore the inscription \"Kokka ank\u014d\" (meaning \"the country and the house, peace and tranquility\"), and at this Tokugawa Ieyasu affected to take umbrage, alleging that it was intended as a curse on him for the character \u5b89 (an, \"peace\") was placed between the two characters composing his own name \u5bb6\u5eb7 (\"ka-k\u014d\", \"house tranquility\") [suggesting subtly perhaps that peace could only be attained by Ieyasu's dismemberment?] ... This incident of the inscription was, of course, a mere pretext, but Ieyasu realized that he could not enjoy the power he had usurped as long as Hideyori lived, and consequently, although the latter more than once dispatched his kerei Katagiri Kastumoto to Sunpu Castle with profuse apologies, Ieyasu refused to be placated.\"Ponsonby-Fane, p. 292; Titsingh, p. 410. * Kanbun 2 (June 16, 1662): An earthquake destroys the temple, the great statue, and the Daibutsu-den; and some accounts say that Sh\u014dgun Ietsuna used the metal to coin sen.Ponsonby- Fane, p. 292 * Kanbun 4\u20137 (1664\u20131667): Rebuilding and repairs were made; and a gilt wooden statue replaced the bronze statue which had been destroyed. A drawing made by Engelbert Kaempfer after his 1691 visit to H\u014dk\u014d-ji was the first image of any Japanese Daibutsu image published in the West.British Library's images on line * An'ei 4 (September 5, 1775): Lightning struck the H\u014dk\u014d-ji, but the fires were quickly contained and the damage was slight. * Kansei 10 (August 12, 1798): Lightning struck, and the Daibutsu-den is entirely burnt along with other nearby structures; but instead of rebuilding, a small gold image which had been kept in the eyebrow of the old statue of the buddha was saved, and this became the central image of the diminished H\u014dk\u014d-ji. The structure in which this small statue was displayed rested on the approximate site of the Imperial Household Museum in late-Taisho/early-Showa Kyoto. \u2013 see view of stone wall under which was part of the original H\u014dk\u014d-ji foundations from Keich\u014d 16 (1588) * Ky\u014dwa gannen or Ky\u014dwa 1 (1801): An image one-tenth the size of Hideyoshi's Daibutsu was presented and installed in a temporary H\u014dk\u014d-ji Daibutsu-den.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 293. * Tenp\u014d 15 (1845): A rich man from Owari province presented a gigantic wooden figure which was displayed until both the image of the buddha and the reconstructed Daibutsu- den were destroyed by fire in the late 20th century. \u2013 see old photo of the H\u014dk\u014d-ji bell with a view of the 19th\u201320th century daibutsu-den * Meiji 3 (1870): H\u014dk\u014d-ji land subdivided\u2014southern portion allotted to Ky\u014dmei-g\u016b and part of the central portion of land was used for the Meiji era reconstruction of the H\u014dkoku-jinja, with the result being that the size of this temple was considerably reduced. * Meiji 3 (1870): H\u014dk\u014d-ji belfry (Sh\u014dr\u014d) which had been added in 1614 was pulled down and re-erected in a nearby location. The multi- ton bell had not been part of original construction, but over time, it has become irretrievably linked with the history of the temple.Ponsonby-Fane, pp. 293\u2013294. == See also == *Ernest Henry Wilson \u2013 * For an explanation of terms concerning Japanese Buddhism, Japanese Buddhist art, and Japanese Buddhist temple architecture, see the Glossary of Japanese Buddhism. ==Notes== ==References== * Ponsonby-Fane, Richard A.
