Built around 1849 in the style of a French Gothic mansion by Charles Kirk for his business partner Thomas Parry, it was privately owned until the 1940s, when Kesteven County Council acquired the house and its grounds. It subsequently served as the county library and part of Sleaford Secondary Modern School (later St George's Academy). The stone house follows an asymmetrical layout and incorporates a range of Gothic elements in its design. In 1974, it was recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building, recognising it as of \"special interest\".\"Listed Buildings\", Historic England.

The largest was Puddingpan Race behind the houses on Westgate, thought to be named for the muddy puddles that formed there. That field was bounded to the north by Drove Lane, a track running to South Rauceby, and parts of the future estate also included \"Millgatemere Furlong\" to the north west and claypits to the north east., figure 5. The map was drawn in c. 1766 by W. Fillingham for Lord Bristol., for origin of the name. Following the enclosure, Drove Lane was straightened and moved northwards by a third of a mile; the old open fields were reorganised within this new space, producing straight, geometric boundary lines. The future Westholme grounds were divided up between several land- owners, including Lord Bristol and Benjamin Handley., showing an enclosure map of 1794, belonging to the Suffolk Record Office, Bury St Edmund's Branch; catalogued as HA 507/3/208. === Private ownership === Thomas Parry (1818\u22121879), an architect, builder and future Member of Parliament for Boston, had purchased the estate by 1846;Sleaford Town Historic Buildings (Sleaford and District Civic Trust, 2009), p. 2.

Parry moved in with his wife, mother and sister, and employed two servants; by 1871, two domestic workers had been added to his household. Parry died in 1879 followed by his wife, Henrietta, in 1882. Henry Peake (1821\u20131886) was occupying Westholme by 1885.Kelly's Directory of Lincolnshire. 1885. p. 628 Peake was a solicitor who served as clerk to the county magistrates, and was a partner in the local law firm Peake, Snow and Peake, along with his son Henry Arthur Peake. The partnership had connections with Kirk and Parry, and Peake married Eliza, a daughter of Charles Kirk the elder. After his death, Peake's sons, George Herbert and Henry Arthur, successively occupied the house in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.Kelly's Directory of Lincolnshire. 1889. p. 397Kelly's Directory of Lincolnshire. 1896. p. 470 During the First World War, Henry Arthur and his wife, Alice Ann, lost three of their sons in battle. and .

Kesteven County Council had acquired the property and its parkland by 1945 and proposed to use it for educational purposes. The council wanted to convert the house into Kesteven County Library, but it had to wait for the War Department to agree to pay fees for \"dilapidations\" caused during its occupancy. The Department provisionally agreed on \u00a31,276 16s in 1947 and the library was operating at the house by 1949.Northern Regional Library System: Handbook, 1949, p. 19 A Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes (NAAFI) canteen supplied school meals after the war; and in 1947 the council bought a series of huts on the site from the War Department.

Westholme has been called their \"most cheerfully inventive\" building; built in the style of a Gothic ch\u00e2teau, Pevsner described the mansion as \"an ebullient essay in French [15th century] domestic Gothic.\" The two-storey house is built in coursed stone with steep, Welsh slate roofing. Its asymmetrical design incorporates an eclectic range of Gothic elements, including tall, polygonal chimney stacks, a four-centred arch doorway, dragon motifs and carved pinnacles. The eastern fa\u00e7ade includes two gables with a tall four-centred arch window. To the right is a tower of three-storeys with a pointed roof which connects to a projecting bay of two storeys. The bay incorporates a stack of three square windows topped with a Flamboyant arch, two hipped roofs with decorative spikes, and three chimneys.See photograph at \"Reference Name MLL4285\", Lincs to the Past (Lincolnshire Archives).
