    "text": "The Bishop of Truro is the ordinary (diocesan bishop) of the Church of England Diocese of Truro in the Province of Canterbury.The Diocese of Truro: Homepage. Retrieved on 7 December 2008. ==History== There had been between the 9th and 11th centuries a Bishopric of Cornwall until it was merged with Crediton and the sees were transferred to Exeter in 1050., Handbook of British Chronology, pp. 214\u2013215. The Diocese of Truro was established by Act of Parliament in 1876 under Queen Victoria. It was created by the division of the Diocese of Exeter in 1876 approximately along the Devon-Cornwall border (a few parishes of Devon west of the River Tamar were included in the new diocese). The bishop's seat is located at Truro Cathedral and his official residence at Lis Escop, Feock, south of Truro. The Bishop of Truro is assisted by the suffragan Bishop of St Germans in overseeing the diocese. Until they moved to Feock the bishops resided at Kenwyn. Lis Escop (the Kenwyn Vicarage of 1780) became after the establishment of the Diocese of Truro the bishop's palace.Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall, 2nd ed. Penguin Books; pp. 84-85 After the bishops moved out for some years it housed part of Truro Cathedral School (closed 1981) then the Community of the Epiphany (Anglican nuns) and is now, as Epiphany House, a Christian retreat and conference centre. Lis Escop is Cornish for \"bishop's palace\". ==List of bishops== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" ! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #7F1734; color: white;\"|Bishops of Truro |-valign=center ! style=\"background- color:#D4B1BB\" width=\"10%\"|From ! style=\"background-color:#D4B1BB\" width=\"10%\"|Until ! style=\"background-color:#D4B1BB\" width=\"30%\"|Incumbent ! style=\"background-color:#D4B1BB\" width=\"45%\"|Notes |-valign=top bgcolor=\"white\" | align=center| 1877 | align=center| 1883 | 60px Edward White Benson | Translated to Canterbury |-valign=top bgcolor=\"#F7F0F2\" | align=center| 1883 | align=center| 1891 | 60px George Wilkinson | Translated to St Andrews, Dunkeld & Dunblane; later became Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church |-valign=top bgcolor=\"white\" | align=center| 1891 | align=center| 1906 | 60px John Gott | Confirmed 28 September 1891. |-valign=top bgcolor=\"#F7F0F2\" | align=center| 1906 | align=center| 1912 | 60px Charles Stubbs | |-valign=top bgcolor=\"white\" | align=center| 1912 | align=center| 1919 | 60px Winfrid Burrows | Translated to Chichester |-valign=top bgcolor=\"#F7F0F2\" | align=center| 1919 | align=center| 1923 | 60px Guy Warman | Translated to Chelmsford; later to Manchester |-valign=top bgcolor=\"white\" | align=center| 1923 | align=center| 1935 | 60px Walter Frere | |-valign=top bgcolor=\"#F7F0F2\" | align=center| 1935 | align=center| 1951 | 60px Joseph Hunkin | |-valign=top bgcolor=\"white\" | align=center| 1951 | align=center| 1960 | 60px Edmund Morgan | Translated from Southampton |-valign=top bgcolor=\"#F7F0F2\" | align=center| 1960 | align=center| 1973 | 60px Maurice Key | Translated from Sherborne |-valign=top bgcolor=\"white\" | align=center| 1973 | align=center| 1981 | 60px Graham Leonard | Translated from Willesden; later to London.
