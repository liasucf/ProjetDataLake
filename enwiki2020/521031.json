    "text": "The Green Mountains are a mountain range in the U.S. state of Vermont. The range runs primarily south to north and extends approximately from the border with Massachusetts to the border with Quebec, Canada. The part of the same range that is in Massachusetts and Connecticut is known as The Berkshires or the Berkshire Hills (with the Connecticut portion, mostly in Litchfield County, locally called the Northwest Hills or Litchfield Hills) and the Quebec portion is called the Sutton Mountains, or Monts Sutton in French. All mountains in Vermont are often referred to as the \"Green Mountains\". \"Green\" because even with winter snow the trees hide the snow and they still appear \"Green\". However, other ranges within Vermont, including the Taconics\u2014in southwestern Vermont's extremity\u2014and the Northeastern Highlands, are not geologically part of the Green Mountains. ==Peaks== Jay Peak Jay Peak, located at the northern end of the Green Mountains in Vermont Green Mountains outside of Montpelier, Vermont The best-known mountains\u2014for reasons such as high elevation, ease of public access by road or trail (especially the Long Trail and Appalachian Trail), or with ski resorts or towns nearby\u2014in the range include:Peak elevations taken from # Mount Mansfield, , the highest point in Vermont # Killington Peak, # Camel's Hump, # Mount Ellen, # Mount Abraham, # Pico Peak, # Stratton Mountain, , the mountain at which the initial ideas of both the Long Trail and the Appalachian Trail were born # Jay Peak, , receives the most snowfall on average in the eastern United States. # Bread Loaf Mountain, # Mount Wilson, # Glastenbury Mountain, # Burke Mountain, The Green Mountains are part of the Appalachian Mountains, a range that stretches from Quebec in the north to Alabama in the south. The Green Mountains are part of the New England/Acadian forests ecoregion. Three peaks\u2014Mount Mansfield, Camel's Hump, and Mount Abraham\u2014support alpine vegetation. ==Tourism== Some of the mountains are developed for skiing and other snow-related activities. Others have hiking trails for use in summer.Green Mountains (Vermont) : Climbing, Hiking & Mountaineering. SummitPost. Retrieved on 2013-07-12. Mansfield, Killington, Pico, and Ellen have downhill ski resorts on their slopes. All of the major peaks are traversed by the Long Trail, a wilderness hiking trail that runs from the southern to northern borders of the state and is overlapped by the Appalachian Trail for roughly of its length. ==History== The Vermont Republic, also known as the Green Mountain Republic,See, e.g., Robert Temple, Edge Effects: The Border-Name Places (2008), p. 6; Paul Finkelman and Stephen E. Gottlieb, Toward a Usable Past: Liberty Under State Constitutions (University of Georgia Press, 2009), p. 375; Ralph Nading Hill, The College on the Hill: A Dartmouth Chronicle (Dartmouth Publications: 1965), pp. 46, 50; Vermont Historical Society, Vermont History, Vol. 66-67 (1998), p. 87. existed from 1777 to 1791, at which time Vermont became the 14th state. Vermont not only takes its state nickname (\"The Green Mountain State\") from the mountains, it is named after them. The French Monts Verts or Verts Monts is literally translated as \"Green Mountains\". This name was suggested in 1777 by Dr. Thomas Young, an American revolutionary and Boston Tea Party participant. The University of Vermont and State Agricultural College is referred to as UVM, after the Latin Universitas Viridis Montis (University of the Green Mountains).History and Traditions, University of Vermont. ==Geology and physiography== Map of the main regions of the northern Appalachians The Green Mountains are a physiographic section of the larger New England province, which in turn is part of the larger Appalachian physiographic division. Lemon Fair runs through the towns of Orwell, Sudbury, Shoreham, Bridport, and Cornwall, Vermont, before flowing into Otter Creek. The story is that its name derives from early English-speaking settlers' phonetic approximation of 'Les Monts Verts'. == See also == * Green Mountain National Forest * Green Mountain Boys\u2014paramilitary infantry led by Ethan Allen that took Fort Ticonderoga during the American Revolution * Green Mountain Club ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Landforms of Addison County, Vermont Category:Landforms of Bennington County, Vermont Category:Landforms of Chittenden County, Vermont Category:Landforms of Lamoille County, Vermont Category:Landforms of Orleans County, Vermont Category:Landforms of Rutland County, Vermont Category:Landforms of Washington County, Vermont Category:Landforms of Windham County, Vermont Category:Mountain ranges of Quebec Category:Mountain ranges of Vermont Category:Physiographic sections Category:Regions of Vermont Category:Subranges of the Appalachian Mountains Category:Vermont culture ",
