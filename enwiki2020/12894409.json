It is endemic to the south west of Western Australia, and restricted largely to the sandy soils of the Swan Coastal Plain and Geraldton Sandplains. The range of Macrozamia fraseri overlaps that of Macrozamia riedlei. == Taxonomy == The species was first described by Friedrich Anton Wilhelm Miquel. ==Description == The form of the species is a low-trunked cycad or upright tree, being highly variable. Leaves are dull and distinctly keeled, leaflets are medium or small. The species grows in low heath, without jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), on sand. Macrozamia fraseri is typical of cycads in being slow-growing, perennial, evergreen and dioecious. The trunk of old plants can be over a metre in height, with a surface burnt by bush fires of the past. Macrozamia fraseri contains poisonous glycosides known as cycasins. ==References== fraseri Category:Endemic flora of Western Australia Category:Cycadophyta of Australia Category:Least concern flora of Australia Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
