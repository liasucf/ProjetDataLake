On 12 February 1979, Manning perished along with her unborn baby (Josiah Hawk), three other children (Ricarda Star, Sunshine Karma, and Eli Changing Sun), and her mother, in a house fire on the Duck Valley Reservation. Her father was the only survivor. The cause of the fire was never determined, but it was considered suspicious and deemed probable arson by John Trudell and others, as it took place the day after Trudell led a protest against the F.B.I. in Washington, D.C. ==References== ===Sources=== *Hoxie, Fredrick E., Mancall, Peter C. and Merrell, James (2001).
