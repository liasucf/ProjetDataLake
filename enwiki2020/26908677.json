    "text": "Structure of Mo(CH3)5, a simple organomolybdenum compound. Organomolybdenum chemistry is the chemistry of chemical compounds with Mo-C bonds. The heavier group 6 elements molybdenum and tungsten form organometallic compounds similar to those in organochromium chemistry but higher oxidation states tend to be more common. ==Mo(0) and more reduced states== Molybdenum hexacarbonyl is the precursor to many substituted derivatives. It reacts with organolithium reagents to give anionic acyls which can be O-alkylated to give Fischer carbenes. (mesitylene)molybdenum tricarbonyl. Mo(CO)6 reacts with arenes to give piano-stool complexes such as (mesitylene)molybdenum tricarbonyl. Cycloheptatrienemolybdenum tricarbonyl, which is related to (arene)Mo(CO)3, reacts with trityl salts to give the cycloheptatrienyl complex: :(C7H8)Mo(CO)3 \\+ (C6H5)3C+ \u2192 [(C7H7)Mo(CO)3]+ \\+ (C6H5)3CH Structure of Cycloheptatrienemolybdenum tricarbonyl. Reduction of Mo(CO)6 gives [Mo(CO)5]2\u2212 which is formally Mo(-II). CO-free Mo(0) compounds tend to be more reducing and kinetically labile than the carbonyl complexes. Examples include bis(benzene)molybdenum (Mo(C6H6)2) and tris(butadiene)molybdenum. Such compounds can be prepared by metal vapor synthesis and reductive routes from molybdenum(V) chloride. ==Mo(II)== Halogenation of Mo(CO)6 gives Mo(II) carbonyl halides, which are also versatile precursors.Joseph L. Templeton \"Four-Electron Alkyne Ligands in Molybdenum(II) and Tungsten(II) Complexes\" Advances in Organometallic Chemistry 1989, Volume 29, Pages 1\u2013100. One large collection of compounds have the formula (C5R5)Mo(CO)3X, derived from cyclopentadienylmolybdenum tricarbonyl dimer (X = halide, hydride, alkyl).Synthesis of Organometallic Compounds: A Practical Guide Sanshiro Komiya Ed. S. Komiya, M. Hurano 1997 Treating molybdenum(II) acetate with methyllithium gives Li4[Mo2(CH3)8]. ==Mo(IV)== With the formula of the type Cp2MoX2 molybdocene dichloride (X = Cl) and molybdocene dihydride (X = H) are both known as are ansa metallocene analogues. Molybdocene dihydride. ==Mo(V) and Mo(VI)== Mo(CH3)5, Mo(CH3)6, and salts of [Mo(CH3)7]- are known. Oxo and imide (RN=) ligands are found in several high oxidation state organomolybdenum compounds. The complexes (C5R5)MoO2X are illustrative. Schrock's Mo-based olefin metathesis catalysts feature molybdenum(VI) centers supported by alkoxide, alkylidene, and imido ligands. ==Organotungsten compounds== Tungsten analogues of almost all organoMo compounds are known. Some notable examples include hexamethyltungsten and analogues of Schrock olefin metathesis catalysts. ==Applications== Mo-based catalysts are useful for olefin metathesis. Some commercially available Schrock catalysts. Trisamidomolybdenum(VI) alkylidyne complexes catalyze alkyne metathesis. In the Kauffmann olefination, molybdenum(III) chloride and methyllithium form an organometallic complex capable of carbonyl olefination. ==References== * ",
