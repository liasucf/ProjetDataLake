    "text": "The Fause Knight Upon the Road is a British ballad, collected and published as Child ballad 3, Roud 20. It features a riddling exchange between a schoolboy and a \"false knight,\" the devil in disguise.Francis James Child, English and Scottish Popular Ballads, \"The Fause Knight Upon the Road\" ==Synopsis== Across numerous versions differing significantly in lyric content, the consistent themes are: * The knight asks the boy where he is going, and what he is carrying (books). * He asks after the sheep, which belong to the boy and his mother, and how many belong to the knight\u2014as many as have blue tails. * The knight may wish him in a tree, the boy to have a ladder, the knight to have it break, and so on. * Throughout any exchange, the boy is described as stood/standing fast/still. This appears to be the condition that will save him. ==Commentary== The boy's ability to evade the devil may spring from the devil's inability to dumbfound him; gaining power over people by this means is a motif found in other folktales.Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 1, p 20, Dover Publications, New York 1965 A Swedish variant features the little boy, but an old woman, presumably a witch, in the place of the knight. ==Recordings and Settings== Recordings *The Blue Velvet Band recorded this song as \"The Knight Upon the Road\" on Sweet Moments (1969). *Tim Hart and Maddy Prior recorded this song as \"False Knight on the Road\" on Summer Solstice (1971). *Steeleye Span recorded this song as \"False Knight on the Road\" on Please to See the King (1971) and Live at Last (1978). *The School of Scottish Studies issued three fragments sung by Bella Higgins, Duncan McPhee and Nellie MacGregor on The Muckle Sangs: Claasic Scots Ballads (1975). *Oysterband recorded this song on the CD The Oxford Girl & Other Stories (2008) and on the CD Single \"This Is The Voice\" (1999). *Jane Siberry recorded her own variant of the song on her 2000 album Hush.
