He was elected a Fellow of the Academies des Technologies (France), the Royal Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters of Belgium, the Science Academy of Turkey, and the Science Academies of Hungary and Poland. Gelenbe was born in Istanbul in 1945, to Yusuf Ali Gelenbe, a descendant of the 18th-century Ottoman mathematician Gelenbevi Ismail Efendi, and Maria Sacchet Gelenbe. After a childhood spent in Istanbul and Alexandria (Egypt), he graduated from Ankara Koleji in 1962 and the Middle East Technical University, Ankara in 1966, where he won the K.K. Clarke Research Award for an undergraduate thesis on \"partial flux switching magnetic memory systems\". Awarded a Fulbright Fellowship, he continued his studies at Polytechnic University, where he completed a master's degree and a PhD thesis on \"Stochastic automata with structural restrictions\", under the supervision of Edward J. Smith. After graduation he joined the University of Michigan as an assistant professor. In 1972, on leave from Michigan, he founded the Modeling and Performance Evaluation of Computer Systems research group at INRIA (France), and was a visiting associate professor at the University of Paris 13 University. In 1971 he was elected to a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium, where he joined Professor Danny Ribbens in 1973, while remaining a research director at INRIA. In 1973, he was awarded a Doctorat d'\u00c9tat \u00e8s Sciences Math\u00e9matiques from the Paris VI University with a thesis on \"Mod\u00e8lisation des syst\u00e8mes informatiques\", under Jacques-Louis Lions. He remained a close friend of Professor Ribbens and of the University of Li\u00e8ge, and in 1979, he moved to the Paris-Sud 11 University, where he co- founded the Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique and its PhD Program, before joining Paris Descartes University in 1986 to found the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Informatique. Gelenbe was appointed New Jersey State Endowed Chair Professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology from 1991 to 1993, and then in 1993 he was appointed to Duke University where he was the Nello L. Teer Chair Professor and Head of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department until 1998 when he moved to the University of Central Florida, and founded the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and created the Harris Corporation Engineering Centre . In 2003, Gelenbe was offered a Chair at Imperial College London and appointed the Dennis Gabor Professor in Computer and Communication Networks and Head of Intelligent Systems and Networks. Following the UK Brexit vote in 2016, in 2017 he was appointed Research in the Laboratoire I3S of the University of Nice and Professor in the Institute of Theoretical and Applied Informatics (IITIS) of the Polish Academy of Sciences where he had been elected Fellow in 2013. He retired from Imperial College in 2019. Since 2019 he pursues an active European career as Coordinator (Principal Investigator) of the EU H2020 Research and Innovation Project SerIoT (2017-2021) on the security of the Internet of Things, Co- Principal Investigator of the EU H2020 Research and Innovation Programmes SDK4ED (2018-2020) and of the H2020 IoTAC Project (2020-2023). His research appears in leading international journals and conferences. He is the Co-Editor in Chief of Springer-Nature Computer Science. He is active in the European National Academies as Section Member for Informatics of Academia Europaea (since 2017), SAPEA Advisor on Cybersecurity for the EU High Level Group (2017), Member of the Fake-News Study Group of the All-European Academies (ALLEA, 2020-2021), and leading the Science Communication (Diffusion des Sciences) of the Royal Belgian Academy of Sciences and the Association of European Academies of Engineering (EuroCase). ==Notable contributions== Gelenbe invented the Random neural network model and its polynomial-time learning algorithm. He invented the eponymous G-network, a mathematical model of the performance of distributed systems and networks with complex node to node interactions, used to analyze dynamic resource allocation in interconnected systems. He has pioneered research concerning the performance of multiprogramming computer systems, virtual memory management, data base reliability optimisation, distributed systems and network protocols. He formed, led, and trained the team that designed the commercial QNAP Computer and Network Performance Modeling Tool. He introduced the Flexsim Object Oriented approach for the simulation in manufacturing systems leading to a widely used commercial product. He published the first work on adaptive control of computer systems to optimise time-sharing systems, and published seminal papers on the performance optimisation of computer network protocols and on diffusion approximations for network performance. He invented the product form queueing networks with negative customers and triggers known as G-networks. He introduced a new spiked stochastic neural network model known as the random neural network, developed its mathematical solution and learning algorithms, and applied it to both engineering and biological problems. His inventions include the first Voice-Packet Switch SYCOMORE for Thales, the random access fibre-optics local area network XANTHOS, a patented admission control technique for ATM networks, a neural network based anomaly detector for brain magnetic resonance scans, and the Cognitive Packet Network routing protocol to offer quality of service to users . From 1984 to 1986 he served as the Science and Technology Advisor to the French Secretary of State for Universities. He founded the ISCIS (International Symposium on Computer and Information Sciences) series of conferences that since 1986 are held annually in Turkey, the USA and Europe to bring together Turkish computer scientists with their international counterparts.https://projekty.iitis.pl/iscis2016 According to the Mathematics Genealogy project, Gelenbe is ranked 9th world- wide among PhD supervisors in the Mathematical Sciences, including Computer Science, having graduated some 90 PhD students. 24 of his former PhD students are women, including Prof. Catherine Rosenberg, Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering of Canada, and Prof. Brigitte Plateau, the former Director General of Higher Education in France. ==Latest research interests== Gelenbe pursues his work on Machine Learning and Neural Networks and Cybersecurity He also currently works on energy efficient computer systems and self-aware networks, and on network security and on networked auctions.
