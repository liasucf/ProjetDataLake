    "text": "(; ; \"pot on the fire\") is a French beef stew. According to the chef Raymond Blanc, pot-au-feu is \"the quintessence of French family cuisine; it is the most celebrated dish in France and considered a national dish. It honours the tables of the rich and poor alike.\"In December 2014, a low-cost pot-au-feu for 4\u20136 persons made with 2kg of vegetables and 1kg of meat cost c. \u20ac10 (\u20ac1.70\u20132.50 per person) or US$13 ($2.15\u20133.25 per person). It is a typical dish served for Christmas. == Origin and history == It is difficult to know when the name pot-au-feu first appeared and when its meaning changed to describe the dish instead of the pot in which it is cooked. While pot was used to describe the rounded pot to cook on the fire at least since the 11th century (even in English),Pot: late Old English pott, probably reinforced in Middle English by Old French pot; of unknown ultimate origin (compare with late Latin potus \u2018drinking cup\u2019). From New Oxford American Dictionary. The late Old English period corresponds to the 11th century. there seems to be no written trace of pot-au-feu until 1673.Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, marquise de S\u00c9VIGN\u00c9, Lettres (1646-1696), edited in 1725 (Fr). In 1600, King Henry IV of France (1553-1610) declared, \"I want no peasant in my kingdom to be so poor that he cannot have a poule au pot on Sundays.\"In French: \"Je veux qu'il n'y ait si pauvre paysan en mon royaume qu'il n'ait tous les dimanches sa poule au pot\" but other variants exist. Poule au pot literally means \"chicken in the pot\" and the so-called traditional recipe resembles the one of \"pot-au-feu\".La poule au pot farcie de \"nouste Henric\" du B\u00e9arn (in French) However, peasants' food was mainly based on bread (c. 500 g/day), root vegetables, in-season vegetables and soup. They rarely ate meat except salted pork, hog-grease, bacon, or other meat, whether it was during religious celebrations or when they dared to poach game from their lord's land. For people living in towns, it was easier to buy inexpensive pieces of meat, which needed long cooking times. The method of cooking all food together and for extended periods of time (the whole day sometimes) gave what was called a \"pot-pourri\" in French and imported into English in the early 17th century.Potpourri: early 17th cent. (denoting a stew made of different kinds of meat): from French, literally \u2018rotten pot\u2019. New Oxford American Dictionary The relation between pot-pourri and pot-au-feu was attested in 1829 in the Etymologic dictionary of the French language: \"Pot pourri. The name our fathers gave to the pot-au- feu\".Jean Baptiste Bonaventure de Roquefort, Dictionnaire \u00e9tymologique de la langue fran\u00e7oise, o\u00f9 les mots sont class\u00e9s par familles: contenant les mots du Dictionnaire de l'Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7oise, avec les principaux termes d'arts, de sciences et de m\u00e9tiers. Pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 d'une dissertation sur l'\u00e9tymologie, Volume 1, 1829, p. 84 Available online on GoogleBooks. Note: adjective \"fran\u00e7oise\" () is the old spelling of \"fran\u00e7aise\" (). One batch of pot-au-feu was maintained as a perpetual stew in Perpignan from the 15th century until World War II. == Main ingredients == Pot-au-feu ingredients: Beefs, carrots, turnips, leeks and onions The cuts of beef and the vegetables involved vary, but a typical pot- au-feu contains: * inexpensive cuts of beef that require cooking for long periods; * some kind of cartilaginous meat, such as oxtail and marrowbone; * vegetables: mainly root vegetables like carrots, turnips, parsnips, celery, onions but also white cabbage and leeks; * spices: bouquet garni, salt, black pepper and cloves. Cooking cartilaginous meat in the stew will result in gelatin being dissolved into the broth. If the stew is allowed to cool, the broth may turn into a jelly. Allowing the stew to cool also allows the removal of excess fat, which floats on the surface and solidifies. In order to give the broth a slightly smoked taste and its typical brown color, onions are cut in half then charred in a frying pan protected by aluminum foil until the onion's surface is completely black. The cloves are driven into the onions so that both onions and cloves can be removed easily before serving. === Serving === Traditionally, the broth is served first with a bit of nutmeg and the marrow (if a marrowbone was used) spread on toasted bread. Then the meat and the vegetables are served with coarse salt and strong Dijon mustard, horseradish sauce, and sometimes also with gherkins pickled in vinegar. Pot- au-feu broth may also be used as a soup (often enriched with rice, pasta or toasted bread), as a base for sauces, or for cooking vegetables or pasta. Ready-to-use concentrated cubes are available to make what purports to be pot- au-feu broth when water is added. === Variants === Many countries have similar dishes with local ingredients. Even within France, ingredients may differ from one region to another and with the season. ==Images== File:Pot-au-feu SAM 2730.JPG|Pot-au-feu with many vegetables File:Vlaamse Hutsepot.jpg|A Flemish pot-au-feu File:Pot-au-feu au plat de c\u00f4te.jpg|Pot-au-feu's side dish File:Pot-au-feu SAM 2724.JPG|Pot-au-feu File:Pot-au-feu SAM 2723.JPG|Served with sauce File:Beef steak, potato salad, pot-au-feu, and highball - Beaf Kitchen Stand, APA Hotel Akihabara shop (2017-04-15 18.24.25 by Naoki Nakashima).jpg|Japanese-style Pot-au-feu ==See also== * Bigos * Bollito misto * Cazuela * Cholent * Cocido * Cozido \u00e0 portuguesa * Sancochado (Peruvian) * Eintopf * Feu * Hot pot (Steamboat) * Jjigae * Kig ha farz * Lancashire hotpot * List of stews * New England boiled dinner * Oden * Olla podrida * Perpetual stew * Pho * Pot roast * Stew * Potjiekos * Tafelspitz ==References== Category:French stews Category:National dishes Category:Christmas food Category:Christmas in France Category:Chicken soups ",
