    "text": "The Garibaldi is a classic Italian aperitivo made with Campari and orange juice from Valencia oranges or whatever is in season. The orange juice is extracted with a high-speed juicer to aerate it and make it frothy, and/or blended at high speed without ice to make it fluffy. Cane syrup can also be added to balance any zesty oils that end up in the juice. The drink was named after Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi and is the flagship drink at the Dante cocktail bar in New York City. Alternatively, a garibaldi can be made with Amaro Averna, Virgin Islands rum, Velvet Falernum, lime juice, orange bitters, and mineral water. ==References== Category:Two-ingredient cocktails ",
