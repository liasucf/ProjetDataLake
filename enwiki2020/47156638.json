    "text": "The International Anticommunist Entente () was an international anti-communist organisation based in Geneva, Switzerland. Prior to 1938, it was known as the International Entente Against the Third International (). The organisation was founded by the Swiss advocate Th\u00e9odore Aubert and Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 Red Cross leader Georges Lodygensky as a response to the Communist International in 1924. Its objectives were to defend the \"principles of order, family, property and nationality\". The entente had national chapters in over 20 countries, with the aim of influencing political and journalistic circles. The British chapter was the Central Council of the Economic Leagues. In Finland, the national chapter Suomen Suojelusliitto was founded by the prominent statesman Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim a year earlier in 1923 to do anti-communist education.Pieni Tietosanakirja IV.

Other notable sympathizers included Philippe P\u00e9tain and Franz von Papen. EIA published Revue Anticommuniste. EIA opened an information centre in August 1937. After World War II, EIA's membership numbers greatly decreased and its leaders considered the United States to be a better center for leading anti-communist activities than Europe. The organisation ceased operation in 1950. == References == Category:Anti-communist organizations Category:1924 establishments in Switzerland Category:International organisations based in Switzerland Category:Organizations established in 1924 Category:Organizations disestablished in 1950 ",
