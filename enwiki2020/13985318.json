    "text": "Moses the Hungarian (, ; ; died July 26, 1043) was a Kievan Russian monk of Hungarian origin. He is venerated as a saint on the 26th of July by the Eastern Orthodox Church. Moses was born around 990\u2013995. Although the Hungarians were mostly pagan at the time (though they later became Christians), the Hungarian chieftain Gyula of Transylvania was baptized in Constantinople. This probably made it possible for Moses to leave Transylvania to serve the princely family in Kiev. Between 1015 and 1018, already preparing to become a monk, he was an escort of Predslava, the daughter of Vladimir I of Kiev and sister of the future Prince Yaroslav I the Wise.

Moses spent the rest of his life in the Kiev Cave Monastery. ==References== Category:990s births Category:1043 deaths Category:11th-century Hungarian people Category:11th-century Rus' people Category:11th-century Christian saints Category:Medieval Hungarian saints Category:Monks of Kiev Pechersk Lavra Category:Eastern Orthodox monks Category:Russian saints of the Eastern Orthodox Church Category:Eastern Orthodox Christians from Hungary Category:Russian people of Hungarian descent Category:Ukrainian people of Hungarian descent Category:Hungarian Christian monks ",
