It publishes a quarterly journal, Canberra Bird Notes, as well as a monthly newsletter, Gang-gang. Its aims are to: * encourage interest in, and develop knowledge of, the birds of the Canberra region * promote and co-ordinate the study of birds * to promote the conservation of native birds and their habitat COG holds monthly meetings in Canberra as well as regular field excursions. The logo of COG is the gang-gang cockatoo. ==References== * Robin, Libby. (2001). The Flight of the Emu: a hundred years of Australian ornithology 1901-2001.
