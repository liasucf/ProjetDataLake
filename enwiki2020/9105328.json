    "text": "Sahib Shihab (born Edmund Gregory; June 23, 1925, Savannah, Georgia - October 24, 1989, Nashville, Tennessee) was an American jazz and hard bop saxophonist (baritone, alto, and soprano) and flautist. He variously worked with Luther Henderson, Thelonious Monk, Fletcher Henderson, Tadd Dameron, and Dizzy Gillespie amongst others. ==Biography== Edmund Gregory first played alto saxophone professionally for Luther Henderson at age 13 and went on to study at the Boston Conservatory and to play with trumpeter Roy Eldridge. He played lead alto with Fletcher Henderson in the mid 1940s. He was one of the first jazz musicians to convert to Islam and changed his name in 1947. During the late 1940s, Shihab played with Thelonious Monk and on July 23, 1951 he recorded with Monk for the Lp Genius of Modern Music: Volume 2. During this period, he also appeared on recordings by Art Blakey, Kenny Dorham and Benny Golson. The invitation to play with Dizzy Gillespie's big band in the early 1950s was of particular significance as it marked Shihab's switch to baritone. On August 12, 1958, Shihab was one of the musicians photographed by Art Kane in his famous photograph known as \"A Great Day in Harlem\". In 1959, he toured Europe with Quincy Jones after getting disillusioned with racial politics in United States and ultimately settled in Scandinavia. He worked for Copenhagen Polytechnic and wrote scores for television, cinema and theatre. In 1961, he joined the Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band and remained a member of the band for the 12 years it existed. He married a Danish woman and raised a family in Europe, although he remained a conscious African-American still sensitive to racial issues. In the Eurovision Song Contest 1966, Shihab accompanied Lill Lindfors and Svante Thuresson on stage for the Swedish entry \"Nygammal Vals\". In 1973, Shihab returned to the United States for a three- year hiatus, working as a session man for rock and pop artists and also doing some copy writing for local musicians. He spent his remaining years between New York and Europe and played in a partnership with Art Farmer. From 1985-86, Shihab was a visiting artist at Rutgers University. Shihab died on October 24, 1989, in Nashville, Tennessee, United States, aged 64. ==Discography== ===As leader=== * 1957: The Jazz We Heard Last Summer (Savoy) split album shared with Herbie Mann * 1957: Jazz Sahib (Savoy) * 1963: Sahib's Jazz Party (Debut) also released as Conversations * 1964: Summer Dawn (Argo) * 1965: Sahib Shihab and the Danish Radio Jazz Group (Oktav) * 1968: Seeds (Vogue Schallplatten) * 1964-70: Companionship (Vogue Schallplatten) * 1972: Sentiments (Storyville) * 1972: La Marche dans le D\u00e9sert - Sahib Shihab + Gilson Unit (Futura) * 1973: Flute Summit (Atlantic) with Jeremy Steig, James Moody and Chris Hinze * 1988: Soul Mates (Uptown) with Charlie Rouse * 1998: And All Those Cats (compilation) ===As sideman=== With Art Blakey *Theory of Art (1957) *Art Blakey Big Band (Bethlehem, 1957) With Brass Fever *Time Is Running Out (Impulse!, 1976) With Donald Byrd *Jazz Lab (Columbia, 1957) with Gigi Gryce *Modern Jazz Perspective (Columbia, 1957) with Gigi Gryce With Betty Carter *Out There (1958) *I Can't Help It (1992) With the Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band * Jazz Is Universal (Atlantic, 1962) * Handle with Care (Atlantic, 1963) * Now Hear Our Meanin' (Columbia, 1963 [1965]) * Swing, Waltz, Swing (Philips, 1966) * Sax No End (SABA, 1967) * Out of the Folk Bag (Columbia, 1967) * 17 Men and Their Music (Campi, 1967) * All Smiles (MPS, 1968) * Faces (MPS, 1969) * Latin Kaleidoscope (MPS, 1968) * Fellini 712 (MPS, 1969) * All Blues (MPS, 1969) * More Smiles (MPS, 1969) * Clarke Boland Big Band en Concert avec Europe 1 (Tr\u00e9ma, 1969 [1992]) * Off Limits (Polydor, 1970) * November Girl (Black Lion, 1970 [1975]) with Carmen McRae * Change of Scenes (Verve, 1971) with Stan Getz With John Coltrane *Coltrane (1957) With Tadd Dameron *Fontainebleau (1956) With Art Farmer *Manhattan (Soul Note, 1981) With Curtis Fuller and Hampton Hawes *Curtis Fuller and Hampton Hawes with French Horns (Status, 1957 [1962]) - also released as Baritones and French Horns (Prestige, 1957) With Dizzy Gillespie *Jazz Recital (Norgran, 1955) *The Dizzy Gillespie Reunion Big Band (MPS, 1968) With Benny Golson *Benny Golson's New York Scene (Contemporary, 1957) *Take a Number from 1 to 10 (Argo, 1961) With Johnny Griffin *Lady Heavy Bottom's Waltz (1968) *Griff 'N Bags With George Gruntz *Noon in Tunisia (1967) With Roy Haynes *Jazz Abroad (Emarcy, 1955) With Milt Jackson *Plenty, Plenty Soul (Atlantic, 1957) With Philly Joe Jones *Drums Around the World (Riverside, 1959) With Quincy Jones *The Birth of a Band!
