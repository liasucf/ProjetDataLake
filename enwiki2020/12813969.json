It runs for from the junction with SR-10 three miles (5 km) south of Castle Dale to the Wilberg Coal Mine, northwest of Orangeville. ==Route description== SR-57 begins at the junction with SR-10 near the Hunter Power Plant, three miles (5 km) southwest of Castle Dale, and runs almost straight north for almost four miles (6 km) until it nears Orangeville. It then bypasses Orangeville heading northwest. At the junction of SR-10 it turns north again and then moves in a north-northwest direction until it reaches its terminus at the southern edge of the Wilberg Mine, about northwest of Orangeville (the Wilberg Mine is the location of the fire that took twenty seven lives in 1984). ==History== The road from SR-29 at Orangeville Junction south through Orangeville (along Main Street) to SR-10 was added to the state highway system in 1927 as a spur of SR-29, and in 1931 it was split off as SR-57. In 1978, the Utah Transportation Commission adopted a realignment onto a bypass of Orangeville, with a new northern terminus on SR-29 at the county road to the Wilberg Mine. An interchange was built at the new SR-29 junction in 1978,Federal Highway Administration, National Bridge Inventory database, 2006 and said county road became an extension of SR-57 in 1982.Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated November 2007, accessed May 2008 ==Major intersections== ==References== 057 057 ",
