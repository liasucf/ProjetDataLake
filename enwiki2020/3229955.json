It was dissolved prior to the 1891 election. It was controlled by a Conservative/Liberal-Conservative majority under Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald and the 3rd Canadian Ministry. The Official Opposition was the Liberal Party, led first by Edward Blake, and later by Wilfrid Laurier. The Speaker was Joseph-Ald\u00e9ric Ouimet.
