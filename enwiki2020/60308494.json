Introduced in March 2015, the service was initially available in Metro Manila connecting the city's suburbs to the central business districts, including the Makati CBD, Ortigas Center and Bonifacio Global City. In February 2016, the express bus service to the Ninoy Aquino International Airport was launched with the franchise awarded to Air Freight 2100 (UBE Express).
