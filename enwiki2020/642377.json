The H\u00f4tel de Rambouillet was the Paris residence of Catherine de Vivonne, marquise de Rambouillet, who ran a renowned literary salon there from 1620 until 1648.M\u00e9moires et documents relatifs au d\u00e9partement de Seine-et-Oise: Inventaire de l'h\u00f4tel de Rambouillet \u00e0 la mort de Charles d'Angennes, marquis de Rambouillet (25 juin 1652), p. 31, note 1: http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k454602q/f30.image.r=voiture%20julie%20d%27angennes.langFR Formerly the H\u00f4tel de Pisani, it was situated in the rue Saint-Thomas-du- Louvre, in a former quarter of Paris (demolished during the 19th century) and located between the Louvre and Tuileries palaces, near the then much smaller Place du Carrousel,1652 map of Paris by Jacques Gomboust: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/1652_Gomboust_9_Panel_Map_of_Paris%2C_France_%28c._1900_Taride_reissue%29_-_Geographicus_- _Paris-gomboust-1900.jpg in the area of what was to become the Pavillon Turgot of the Louvre Museum. (This H\u00f4tel de Rambouillet, formerly H\u00f4tel de Pisani, should not be confused with the one by same name situated on Rue Saint-Honor\u00e9, which belonged to the d'Angennes family who sold it in December 1602, and on which site Cardinal Richelieu began building his Palais-Cardinal in 1624.)Walckenaer, Charles Athanase (M. le baron), M\u00e9moires touchant la vie et les \u00e9crits de Marie de Rabutin Chantal, dame de Bourbilly, marquise de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, durant le minist\u00e8re du cardinal Mazarin et la jeunesse de Louis XIV, Librairie Firmin Didot Fr\u00e8res, Imprimeurs de l'Institut, 56 rue Jacob, Paris, 1843, pp. 382-383. Members of her salon, received in the intimacy of her Chambre Bleue, admitted to the ruelleAntoine Baudeau de Somaize published a Grand Dictionnaire des Pr\u00e9cieuses, ou La Clef de la Lanque des Ruelles (1660-1661).\u2014the space between her daybed and the wall of the alcove\u2014 represented the flower of contemporary French literature, fashion, and wit, including Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, Madame de La Fayette, Mademoiselle de Scud\u00e9ry, the Duchesse de Longueville, the Duchesse de Montpensier, Jean-Louis Guez de Balzac, Bossuet, Jean Chapelain, Corneille, Fran\u00e7ois de Malherbe, Racan, Richelieu, La Rochefoucauld, Paul Scarron, Claude Favre de Vaugelas, and Vincent Voiture. They adopted for themselves the term pr\u00e9cieux, which became a term of abuse when satirized by Moli\u00e8re in Les Pr\u00e9cieuses ridicules (1659). The quality looked for in this self-defining circle was honn\u00eatet\u00e9, a quality looked for in vain at the contemporary court, crass, ostentatious, corrupt and corrupting.Honn\u00eatet\u00e9 is discussed at some more length by Jacques Revel, \"The uses of civility\" in Roger Chartier, editor, A History of Private life: Passions of the Renaissance, Arthur Goldhammer, translator, (Belknap Press, Harvard University), p 192ff. Honn\u00eatet\u00e9 was a mode of restraint and decorum, so practiced that it had become easy and as if natural, shared by aristocrats and fastidious members of the high bourgeoisie, but which could not readily be taught or learned. In contrast with the court, the H\u00f4tel de Rambouillet received an elite that chose its own members, or, more precisely, whose members recognized one another's right to belong.... The ordinary rules of civility did not govern daily interchange. Members of the group wrote and above all talked to one another. Conversation was a sacred art, the forum in which the group developed its taste. L'Astr\u00e9e was staged as well as read; other reading included the novels of La Calpren\u00e8de and Mlle de Scud\u00e9ry, which held up a mirror of this microsociety\".Revel, p 194. The pr\u00e9ciosit\u00e9 refinements of the French language would find some codification in the Dictionnaire de l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise eventually published by the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, which found its start in the H\u00f4tel de Rambouillet. Words like \"celadon\" to describe a certain range of pale glaucous blue-green glazes of Chinese porcelain come straight from the H\u00f4tel de Rambouillet. ==See also== * Pr\u00e9cieuses ==Notes== ==Further reading== * Leon H.
