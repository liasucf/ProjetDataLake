    "text": "The gens Staberia was a minor plebeian family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens are first mentioned in the final decades of the Republic, but they never achieved much importance. The most illustrious of the Staberii may have been the Grammarian Staberius Eros, though he was a freedman. One of this family served as a military tribune in the time of Vespasian, but none of the Staberii obtained any of the higher offices of the Roman state; the consul Marcus Pompeius Silvanus Staberius Flavianus belonged to the Pompeia gens, although he was probably descended from the Staberii through a female line.Eck, \"M. Pompeius Silvanus\", p. 266. ==Origin== The nomen Staberius is probably of Oscan origin. Chase classifies it among those names that did not originate at Rome, but were of Oscan, Umbrian, or Picentine derivation.Chase, pp. 128, 129. ==Members== * Staberius, a wealthy man whose will stipulated that his heirs should have the amount of their inheritance engraved upon his tombstone; otherwise, they were to exhibit games featuring a hundred pairs of gladiators, and such other entertainment as dictated by a certain Arrius, and purchase as much grain as was grown in Africa. Horace gives Staberius as an example of the madness of the covetous.Horace, Satirae, ii. 3. 84 ff.Porphyrion, Commentarii in Horatium.PW, \"Staberius\", No. 1.PIR, S. 584. * Lucius Staberius, prefect of Apollonia under Pompeius in 48 BC, during the Civil War. When Caesar's forces approached the city, the populace determined to welcome him, forcing Staberius to abandon his position.Caesar, De Bello Civili, iii. 12.Appian, Bellum Civile, ii. 54.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 898 (\"Staberius\").PW, \"Staberius\", No. 2.Broughton, vol. II, p. 283. * Quintus Staberius, mentioned by Cicero in 45 BC as the owner of land in which he was interested at Pompeii or Nola in Campania.Cicero, Epistulae ad Atticum, xiii. 8.PW, \"Staberius\", No. 3. * Staberius Eros, a grammarian of considerable repute, highly praised by Fronto.Suetonius, De Illustribus Grammaticis, 13.PW, \"Staberius\", No. 4. * Titus Staberius T. f. Secundus, a military tribune with the Legio VII Gemina in Germania Inferior during the reign of Vespasian. According to a military diploma from AD 78, he had been prefect of a cohort of soldiers from Chalcedon in Africa, and prefect of a Moesian cavalry wing..PW, \"Staberius\", No. 5. ==See also== * List of Roman gentes ==References== ==Bibliography== * Marcus Tullius Cicero, Epistulae ad Atticum. * Gaius Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Civili (Commentaries on the Civil War). * Quintus Horatius Flaccus (Horace), Satirae (Satires). * Pomponius Porphyrion, Commentarii in Q.
