    "text": "The End Begins is the third studio album from American band Tantric. It is the first one recorded without the band's original members Todd Whitener, Matt Taul, and Jesse Vest. Vocalist Hugo Ferreira, the only remaining original member, was forced to scrap the original line-up's complete third album in favor of The End Begins, an effort established by new members of the band in addition to Ferreira. This is the only studio album to feature former Fuel drummer Kevin Miller. ==Background== Left without a band, Hugo Ferreira scrapped the entire record. He began writing new material at his own studio before enlisting members of his side project, State of the Art, to record and tour as Tantric. These include ex-Fuel drummer Kevin Miller, ex-DramaGods bassist Joe Pessia on guitar, Fosterchild bassist Erik Leonhardt, and Marcus Ratzenboeck on electric violin, adding another dimension to the band. Ratzenboeck's brother Derek, a classical concert violinist, would composed the intro violin riff to the song \"Down & Out.\" With returning producer Toby Wright, the new line-up finished recording within 30 days in September 2007.The End Begins: Kevin Miller of Tantric AllAccessMagazine.com (May 15, 2008).

As of July 11, 2008, it has sold over 10,000 copies, with the lead single, \"Down & Out\" at #8 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart. The song's popularity led it to become Tampa Bay Rays slugger Evan Longoria's walk-up theme. In regards to the album title, Hugo Ferreira cited the process up to its inception and stated, \"the end of one thing led to the beginning of another.\" He also noted that the majority of songs revolve around either the band itself or a troubled personal relationship he endured during the writing process. Ferreira described the album's lyrical themes in a November 2008 interview: :\u201cThis record is all about the strife and challenges of getting back on my feet after the second Tantric record, After We Go, not only on a professional sense but a personal one as well. It deals with personal and emotional growth, and learning from the blows the industry and life gives you.\u201dSilva, Kait Long Live Tantric AcedMagazine.com (November 20, 2008).
