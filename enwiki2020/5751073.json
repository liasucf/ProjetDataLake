    "text": "The Legendary Saga of St. Olaf or Helgisaga \u00d3l\u00e1fs konungs Haraldssonar is one of the kings' sagas, a 13th-century biography of the 11th-century Saint Olaf II of Norway. It is based heavily on the largely lost Oldest Saga of St. Olaf. The composition is primitive and clumsy and the saga essentially consists of a series of separate anecdotes extracted from skaldic verse.Andersson 2006, p. 14. The anonymous author may have been a Norwegian and the saga is preserved in one mid-13th-century Norwegian manuscript.Bjarni A\u00f0albjarnarson 1941, p. XIII. It is thought to have been composed in the early 13th century.Finlay 2004, p. 9. Snorri Sturluson is believed to have used a work closely similar to the Legendary Saga when he composed his Separate Saga of St. Olaf and Heimskringla.Hoops 1999, p. 243. ==See also== *The Saint Olav Drama ==Notes== ==References== * Andersson, Theodore Murdock (2006).
