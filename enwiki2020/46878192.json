Judy maintains possession through the loyalty of Old Carson (Pallette) and Bud Lee (Santschi), her foreman, and they thwart the efforts of Bayne Trevor (Clary) and his gang to demoralize the ranch hands to require the selling of the property. Judy holds a dance at the ranch where everyone is expected to be in full dress, and the cowboys use mail order to ensure they are fully equipped for the event. Trevor's gang holds up and robs the paymaster of Judy's ranch, but Bud Lee obtains other money in time so that the men can be paid. He then proceeds to hunt the thief and eventually finds that it is one of Trevor's men. This results in several realistic fistfights. ==Cast== *Pauline Frederick as Judith Sanford *Tom Santschi as Bud Lee *Charles Clary as Bayne Trevor *Dave Winter as Pollock Hampton *Eugene Pallette as Old Carson *Billy Elmer as Poker face *Jack Curtis as Chris Quinnion *Jim Barley as Benny *Sam Appel as Crowdy *Clarissa Selwynne as Mrs. Grimley *Otis Harlan as Major Langworthy *Jean Calhoun as Marcia Langworthy *Tom Bates as Jose *Lydia Yeamans Titus as Mrs Simpson *Frank Clark as Dr. Tripp *Bud Sterling as Tommy Burkitt *Elise Collins as Maid ==References== ==External links== * * *Preserved lobby poster (worthpoint.com) Category:1922 films Category:American silent feature films Category:American films Category:Films directed by Colin Campbell Category:Lost Western (genre) films Category:1922 Western (genre) films Category:American Western (genre) films Category:American black-and- white films Category:Lost American films Category:Film Booking Offices of America films Category:1922 lost films ",
