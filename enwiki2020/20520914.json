He served for 26 years, gaining a reputation as one of the court's most prolific justices. == Early life == Negr\u00f3n Garc\u00eda was born 31 December 1940 in R\u00edo Piedras, Puerto Rico. His father was Luis Negr\u00f3n Fern\u00e1ndez, who would eventually serve as Associate Justice and Chief Justice of the Court. He earned a B.A. from the University of Puerto Rico in 1962, and earned his law degree from the same in 1964. == Law career == Upon being admitted to the bar that same year, Negr\u00f3n Garc\u00eda went to work as a legal advisor for the Puerto Rico Power and Water company. He served as a judge in a District Court from 1966 to 1969, at which point he was elevated to a Superior Court. From 1972 to 1974 he presided over the Governor's Judicial Appointment Advisory Committee, as well as serving as Executive Secretary of the Justice Reform Council of Puerto Rico. == Supreme Court == After Tr\u00edas Monge's appointment to Chief Justice in 1974, there remained one vacancy in the Supreme Court. Hern\u00e1ndez Col\u00f3n had avoided filling the spot until Negr\u00f3n Garc\u00eda had fulfilled the Supreme Courts requirement for membership: ten years as a licensed jurist in Puerto Rico. At the time, he was the youngest person ever to be appointed to the Supreme Court. == Retirement == In 2000 Negr\u00f3n Garc\u00eda stepped down after 26 years as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. He is currently a professor at the Universidad Interamericana.
