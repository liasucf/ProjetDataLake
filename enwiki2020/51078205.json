The channels are available through Optus' Yes TV by Fetch IPTV platform, or through an Optus Decoder on the VAST Satellite Network, as well as through companion apps and the Optus Sport website. The network was launched after Optus outbid the incumbent Foxtel for the English Premier League television rights, and the 24/7 channel Optus Sport 1 rebroadcasts the IMG world feed. ==History== In the beginning of Optus Television, Optus had used sports rights as a key differentiator between it and rival Foxtel.Optus Lines Up For Goal They carried C7 Sport on their subscription television network until March 2002, when Optus replaced them with Fox Sports (Australia), rebranded as 'Optus Sports' until October of that year. In 2009 Optus Television ceased to be offered to new subscribers and the service was eventually ceased.Seven and Optus dispute may end in Legal Channels In July 2010, Malaysian backed Fetch TV launched in Australia, available through Optus.New Fetch TV Box service: It's a game changer: Delimiter In 2015, new CEO Allen Lew, who had launched parent company Singtel's EPL coverage, laid out a three-year plan (2016\u201318) for Optus to transition from a Telecommunications provider to a multimedia company, as a 'content aggregator'.Optus unveils EPL App and Set Top BoxesOptus CEO goes OTT in network content battle Optus began trialling their own content delivery network in March 2015,Optus, Nokia Trial real time video delivery and in November 2015 it was announced Optus had purchased the rights for the English Premier League in Australia until the conclusion of the 2018/19 season.Optus snatches EPL rights from Fox Sports in Australia In March 2016 it was announced the channels would be available through Fetch TV from Optus (rebranded as 'Yes TV'), as well as through a dedicated app and website, with satellite coverage available for those without appropriate internet speeds or for commercial venues.Optus Unveils Plans for the EPL This announcement also included the fact that one match per round would be sub-licensed to a Free-to- Air channel. It was revealed by SBS that they had traded their FIFA World Cup licence for this sub-licence.SBS strike EPL deal with Optus: SBS Optus announced pricing for the EPL coverage in May, which was revised after being poorly received by customers, with new pricing, including a period of 'free' coverage, announced in June.Optus Customers to get EPL from 15 per month on selected plansOptus Offers the new EPL season for Free Optus also announced they had done a deal with the Nine Network to share the International Champions Cup rights, with Optus showing all games played outside of Australia. Nine would share the China leg and retain exclusive rights to the Australian matches.Optus secures rights to ICC This was the first live sport broadcast on the channels, with Manchester United playing Borussia Dortmund in Shanghai on 22 July 2016 as the first live event. Optus also added a friendly West Ham United pre-season match, and would later show their unsuccessful Europa League Qualifier against Astra Giurgiu.Optus to Deliver More Live and Exclusive Pre-Season Football Action ===Initial Controversy=== The news that Optus had secured the Premier League rights was not received well by existing supporters. Most were locked into plans with either Foxtel or other telecommunications providers, and were skeptical of how Australia's poor network infrastructure could handle 'live' broadcasts over IPTV. The first three rounds were mired with complaints on social media and in other media outlets.Optus EPL Fail Aussie Sports Fans Deserve Better Many fans were also unhappy that government broadcaster SBS had traded away their rights to the 2018 FIFA World Cup, albeit maintaining all Australian matches, select group stage games and the majority of the knockout stages. ===Foxtel Response=== Incumbent rights holder Fox Sports (Australia) reacted quickly to the news they had lost the rights, removing the $15/month add-on BeIN Sports pack, and adding the channels to the existing Sports package. Club TV channels for Chelsea FC, Liverpool FC and Manchester United were also added, as were agreements to show Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur games on delay. Foxtel claimed Optus had threatened legal action over the new 'free' channels, and so added a 1 cent per channel per year charge to each. ===Growth=== Optus began to gradually add regional football competitions featuring Australian national teams, the 2016 FIFA Futsal World Cup and the 2016 AFF U-19 Youth Championship. They also screened the semi finals and final of the 2016 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. In October 2016, Optus Sport 2 began broadcasting ads with the tagline: 'This summer is going to be big', announcing the launch of a 24/7 Cricket channel on the channel for November 1, 2016, running until 28 February 2017. This was an extension of the existing Optus agreement with Cricket Australia that saw all Optus customers eligible for a Cricket Australia Live Pass. The channel showed highlights and full match replays from ongoing matches, and original content such as '#Stumps', which had previously been available on the defunct Optus Cricket app. It also showed classic matches from the Cricket Australia archives. Live content was available by linking the Optus Sport mobile app with the Cricket Australia App, but no live cricket content was available on the linear Optus Sport 2 channel. Optus struggled to find further new sports to add to the service given that most major Australian sporting codes were signed to long-term broadcast contacts. They bid for exclusive rights to the A-League but balked at the added cost of technical and equipment fees. As of May 2017, CEO Allen Lew considered the rights acquisition and launch of Optus Sport a success, and hinted that further similar offerings may be added to the 'Yes TV' platform in the near future, although they would be 'non-sport related' and 'family oriented.' It was later revealed that Lew was discussing the launch of the National Geographic App. ===2018 FIFA World Cup & Relinquishing rights to SBS=== Optus Sport purchased exclusive broadcast rights to broadcast 39 live matches of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in a deal with the public broadcaster SBS, who were awarded the original broadcast rights by FIFA. The remaining 25 matches would be simultaneously broadcast live on Optus Sport and SBS. The first game of the tournament that was broadcast exclusively on Optus Sport, Egypt vs. Uruguay on 15 June 2018, was marred with technical difficulties including buffering issues and failed connections. The negative reception and continued broadcasting problems resulted in a temporary arrangement made between Optus and SBS to broadcast all games on 18 and 19 June throughout a 48-hour period on SBS. This arrangement with SBS was extended on 20 June 2018 to include all group stage games, with Optus additionally leaving their app and streaming services free for the duration of the World Cup and until 31 August 2018 while refunding all current paid subscriptions. On 28 June 2018, Optus subsequently extended this arrangement to include all remaining matches at the World Cup. ==Channels and content== Optus Sport operates eleven multiplex channels: *Optus Sport 1 Optus Sport 1 is the main channel, which predominantly shows Premier League however also shows UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and internationals.
