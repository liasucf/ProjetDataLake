    "text": "The Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance is an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards. According to the 54th Grammy Awards description guide it is designed for solo, duo/groups or collaborative (vocal or instrumental) rock recordings and is limited to singles or tracks only. This award combines the previous categories for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best Rock Instrumental Performance. The restructuring of these categories was a result of the Recording Academy's wish to decrease the list of categories and awards and to eliminate the distinctions between solo and duo/groups performances. The Academy argued that any distinction between these performances is difficult to make, as \"four-fifths of rock acts are groups, and even solo rock acts tend to be backed by a band\".Grammy Awards restructuring The award goes to the artist. The producer, engineer and songwriter can apply for a Winners CertificateGrammy Blue Book. From 2014, this category has also included hard rock performances that were previously screened in the Best Hard Rock Performance and Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance categories, which are now defunct. ==Recipients== Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters were the inaugural winners of the award David Bowie was posthumously honoured in 2017 Leonard Cohen posthumously won in 2018 {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" ! scope=\"col\" bgcolor=\"#efefef\"|Year ! scope=\"col\" bgcolor=\"#efefef\"|Performing artist ! scope=\"col\" bgcolor=\"#efefef\"|Work ! scope=\"col\" bgcolor=\"#efefef\" class=unsortable|Nominees ! scope=\"col\" bgcolor=\"#efefef\" class=unsortable|Ref. |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2012 | Foo Fighters | \"Walk\" | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text- align:center;\"|2013 | The Black Keys | \"Lonely Boy\" | |style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2014 | Imagine Dragons | \"Radioactive\" | |style=\"text-align:center;\"|2014 Nominees |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2015 | Jack White | \"Lazaretto\" | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2016 | Alabama Shakes | \"Don't Wanna Fight\" | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2017 |David Bowie |\"Blackstar\" | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2018 |Leonard Cohen |\"You Want It Darker\" | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2019 | Chris Cornell | \"When Bad Does Good\" | | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Grammy.com, 7 December 2018 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2020 | Gary Clark Jr. | \"This Land\" | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |} ==Artists with multiple nominations== ;5 nominations *Brittany Howard (4 with Alabama Shakes) ;4 nominations *Alabama Shakes ;3 nominations *Foo Fighters *Jack White ;2 nominations *Arctic Monkeys *The Black Keys *David Bowie *Coldplay *Chris Cornell *Mumford & Sons ==See also== *Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance *Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance *Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance *Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal *Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance *Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance *Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance *Grammy Award for Best Rock Song ==References== == External links == * Official Site of the Grammy Awards Category:Grammy Awards for rock music Rock Performance ",
