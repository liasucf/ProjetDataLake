    "text": "A mozzarella pie with pepperoni from Sally's Apizza Pepe's in New Haven, Connecticut New Haven-style pizza, locally known as apizza (, from Neapolitan \u2019a pizza () \"the pizza\"), is a style of thin-crust, coal-fired Neapolitan pizza common in and around New Haven, Connecticut. It originated at the Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana and is now served in many other pizza restaurants in the area, most notably Sally's Apizza and Modern Apizza. This geographically limited pizza style has been favorably referenced by national critics. Sally's is ranked six, while Pepe's is ranked twelve, out of 25 restaurants nationally. ==Characteristics== In a New Haven-style pizzeria, a \"plain\" pizza is a crust, oregano, and tomato sauce with a little bit of grated pecorino romano cheese. A \"plain\" New Haven-style pizza may also be called a \"tomato pie\". Mozzarella is considered to be a topping; a customer who wants it must ask for it. Pepe invented the \"white clam pie\". Pepe's restaurant served littleneck clams on the half shell at the bar, which he later added to the pizza. The white clam pie is a crust, olive oil, oregano, grated cheese, chopped garlic, and fresh littleneck clams. What makes New Haven-style pizza distinct is its thin, oblong crust, characteristic charring, chewy texture, and limited use of melting cheeses. It tends to be drier and thinner than, but closely related to, traditional New York-style pizza. Both styles in turn are close descendants of the original Neapolitan style. ==Cooking and serving methods== New Haven-style pizza is traditionally baked in a coal-fired oven at extremely hot temperatures above . It is sold whole rather than by the slice. ==Availability== Although most commonly available in the New Haven area, New Haven-style pizza has begun to spread to other parts of the United States. It has been available in the Italian-American areas of Bridgeport, and other shoreline communities for many years; Frank Pepe\u2019s also claims a location in the Italian-heavy New York area (Yonkers). New Haven- style has penetrated areas typically not known for large Italian-American populations, including towns in northern and central Connecticut, as well as other cities across the United States. ==See also== * ==References== ==Further reading== * Shelton, Jim (July 21, 2002). \"You say Sally's, I say Pepe's.\" New Haven Register.
