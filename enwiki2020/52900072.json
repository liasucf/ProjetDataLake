    "text": "Party for Life Security (, S\u017dJ) was a Czech political party that focused on Pensioner's issues. It became widely known during 1998 Czech legislative election when it was expected to gain seats in Parliament. ==History== S\u017dJ was established on 22 December 1989 as Pensioner's Movement for Life Security (, HD\u017dJ). Josef Kon\u00ed\u010dek became the first leader of the Party. HD\u017dJ transformed into a political party in 1994 and changed its name to Pensioners for Life Security (,D\u017dJ). S\u017dJ participated in the 1996 legislative election in coalition with Czech Union of Women. Eduard Kremli\u010dka became the leader of S\u017dJ after the election. S\u017dJ started to rise in polls ahead of the 1998 legislative election and was expected to gain over 10% of the popular vote. Social Democrat leader Milo\u0161 Zeman started coalition talks with S\u017dJ and KS\u010cM. Party leader Kremli\u010dka made a bet with a reporter that he would eat a bug if S\u017dJ failed to get over the 5% threshold, but S\u017dJ received only 3% and Kremli\u010dka had to eat a bug, which resulted in his expulsion from the party because other members of S\u017dJ concluded that he dishonored all pensioners. S\u017dJ changed its name to Party for Life Security (, S\u017dJ). It merged with Independent Democrats in 2006. ==Election results== === Chamber of Deputies === {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Year !
