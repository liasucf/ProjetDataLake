    "text": "The Waterbury Branch is a branch of the Metro-North Railroad New Haven Line, running north from a junction in the Devon section of Milford to Waterbury. Originally built as the Naugatuck Railroad, it once continued north to Winsted. The part north of Waterbury is now leased from CDOT by the Railroad Museum of New England, which operates excursion trains from Thomaston station through their operating subsidiary Naugatuck Railroad ; this name was chosen in homage of the original railroad. The trackage ends in Torrington but Metro North service on the branch ends at Waterbury. There are conceptual plans to extend service from its current terminus in Waterbury to Hartford via Bristol and New Britain. Currently, riders that want to continue to New Britain and Hartford have to transfer to an express bus operated by CTtransit at Waterbury. Except for one weekday morning peak train that operates from Waterbury to Stamford, all trains on this branch operate as shuttles between Waterbury and Bridgeport. For most of its route, the branch runs parallel to the Housatonic River, viewable on the left side northbound and the right side southbound. On April 6, the service was cut down to buses in response to the coronavirus pandemic. ==History== In 1906, work on double-tracking the branch between Seymour and Waterbury was underway. In September 2015, it was announced that out of Governor Malloy's 30 year-$100 Billion transportation plan, $350 Million has been included to improve service along the branch. The upgrades include a new signal system with multiple passing sidings to increase service, newer equipment, and station rehabilitation. Currently, only one train is allowed on the branch at a time. The signalization of the line will allow for multiple trains to safely be on the branch at a time, while allowing for increased capacity and safer train operation. Four passing sidings, at Devon, Derby, Beacon Falls, and Waterbury, will be built, and they are expected to be completed in 2018. Work began on a siding just north of the Derby\u2013Shelton station and is expected to be completed in late 2015. Some of the 16 grade crossings on the line will be permanently closed, while others will have gates and flashers installed to prevent accidents. The entire project is schedule to be completed in November 2020 and will cost $73 million. CTDOT also purchased locomotives from NJ Transit that, once overhauled, will be put into branch line service. ==Stations== The following connecting services are available to Amtrak,https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/timetables/Amtrak- System-Timetable-060118.pdf Metro-North Railroad,http://web.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NH_MF_Sept_30_2018.pdf Shore Line East,https://shorelineeast.com/images/docs/SLE- Timetable.pdf#view=FitH CT Transit, and Greater Bridgeport Transit Authority. {|class=\"wikitable\" !Zone !Location !Station !Miles (km) from GCT !Date opened !Date closed !Connections / notes |- |16 |Stamford | | |1849 | |Metro-North Railroad: New Haven Line Amtrak: , Northeast Regional, Metro-North Railroad: New Canaan Branch CTrail: Shore Line East (limited service) CTtransit Stamford: 311, 312, 313, 321, 322, 323, 331, 332, 333, 334, 341, 342, 343, 344, I-BUS Express, Stamford Commuter Shuttle, Bulls Head, North, Route 1 East Greyhound Lines, Peter Pan Bus Lines, UConn Stamford Shuttle Limited service station |- |19 |Bridgeport | | |1840 | |Metro-North Railroad: New Haven Line Amtrak: Northeast Regional, Vermonter CTrail: Shore Line East (limited service) Greater Bridgeport Transit: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 17, 19X, 22X, 23, Coastal Link Greyhound Lines, Peter Pan Bus Lines Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Ferry Sacred Heart University Transit Shuttle, University of Bridgeport Shuttle |- |20 |Stratford | | | | |Metro-North Railroad: New Haven Line CTrail: Shore Line East (limited service) Greater Bridgeport Transit: 1, 10, 16, 23, Coastal Link |- |rowspan=6|51 |Derby | | |1849 | |Greater Bridgeport Transit: 15, 23 CTtransit New Haven: 255 |- |Ansonia | | |1849 | |CTtransit New Haven: 255 |- |Seymour | | |1849 | |CTtransit New Haven: 255 |- |Beacon Falls | | |1849 | | |- |Naugatuck | | |1849 | |CTtransit Waterbury: N1, N2, T74 |- |Waterbury | | |1849 | |CTfastrak: 925, 928 |} ==Rolling stock== Waterbury Branch train with depowered SPV-2000 coaches at Waterbury in 2003 The Waterbury Branch uses 2008 Brookville BL20GH and GE Genesis P32AC-DM locomotives and Shoreliner passenger coaches. It has also used Mafersa coaches originally purchased for service on Shore Line East. Prior to the arrival of push-pull coaches, the branch used self-propelled Budd RDC and SPV-2000 railcars, the later of which were later converted to coaches. A typical shuttle consists of three cars. ==See also== *Naugatuck Railroad *Connecticut Commuter Rail Council ==References== Category:Transportation in New Haven County, Connecticut Category:Transportation in Fairfield County, Connecticut Category:Metro-North Railroad Category:Rail infrastructure in Connecticut Category:Passenger rail transportation in Connecticut ",
