    "text": "Guitar Days - An Unlikely Story of Brazilian Music is a 2018 Brazilian documentary film directed by Caio Augusto Braga. Released in 2019 at Festival In-Edit Brasil, the film depicts the story of Brazilian indie rock predecessors, the guitar bands, and the current alternative rock scenario in the country. == Synopsis == A new generation of rock bands decides to defy the status quo and immerse in a new not-so-Brazilian genre, permanently transforming the national music scenario with their noisy guitars, lyrics in English and vigorous performances. Singing in English was not an option anymore, even if that meant being disowned by the mainstream media for good. They are the guitar bands. == Production == The documentary was produced without sponsorships or public grants. In order to raise funds to finance the film production, the director came up with concerts in S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte, part of a crowdfunding programme. Although the financing did not reach the expected amount of money, the concerts were maintained and the audience was able to see, after 18 years, the return of Killing Chainsaw, apart from the concerts of Second Come, Mickey Junkies, The Cigarettes, Valv, among others. Right after the crowdfunding's concerts, the director Caio Augusto Braga flies to England to interview artists that influenced the guitar movement in Brazil, such as Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth), Mark Gardener (Ride), Stephen Lawrie (The Telescopes), and also the British journalist, discoverer of grunge, Everett True. In 2018, Pin Ups records its first song in years for the film music compilation released in 2019 by the Brazilian label Midsummer Madness Records. == Awards and Nominations == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Organisation !Category !Nomination !Result |- |2018 |Festival Premios Latino del Cine y la M\u00fasica - Spain |Best Documentary |Guitar Days | |- |2018 |Festival Premios Latino del Cine y la M\u00fasica - Spain |Best Director |Caio Augusto Braga | |- |2019 |Indie Nuts Festival - Germany |Best Documentary |Guitar Days | |} == Guitar Days/Midsummer Madness - Various Artists Album == In September of 2019, the label Midsummer Madness Records releases an album, compilation of various artists, in CD and digital platform, of bands related to the guitar movement.
