    "text": "Sunnery James & Ryan Marciano is a Dutch DJ and record production duo from Amsterdam, composed of Sunnery Gorr\u00e9 (Sunnery James) and Ryan de Lange (Ryan Marciano). Both DJs are of Surinamese descent. Accustomed to renowned labels, they released \"SOTU\" in March 2013, collaboration with Nicky Romero, on the label of Steve Angello. The title was a success, ranking as high as #2 on the Beatport Top 100. Soon after, the duo joined Spinnin' Records, where they signed many singles such as \"Triton\", \"Salute\", and more recently \"Come Follow\". They have since joined the Armada Music family with their own imprint SONO Music. Their music has developed a distinct tribal style to it. ==Discography== ===Extended plays=== *Affective (2018) *Love, Dance and Feel (2019) ===Charting singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:2em;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:17em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font- size:90%;\"| NLD ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| BEL (Fl) |- |2013 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Triton\" (Dance Valley 2013 Anthem) (with DubVision) | \u2014 || \u2014 |rowspan=\"2\" |- |2014 ! scope=\"row\"| \"S.O.T.U.\" (with Nicky Romero featuring Fast Eddie) | \u2014 || \u2014 |- | colspan=\"6\" style=\"font-size:90%\"| \"\u2014\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. |} ===Other singles=== Only singles and remixes released since October 2012 are listed below: * 2011: Markuzza/Zweepstok [Size Records] * 2011: Lethal Industry [Spinnin Records] * 2012: Finally Here [Spinnin Records] * 2013: Firefaces (Energy 2013 Anthem) (with Jaz von D) [Spinnin Records] * 2013: Stiffness (with Chocolate Puma) [X] * 2013: Ultronic [Spinnin Records] * 2013: Triton (Dance Valley 2013 Anthem) (with DubVision) [Spinnin Records] * 2013: S.O.T.U.
