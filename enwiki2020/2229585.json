    "text": "Route 759 is a short state highway in the city of St. Joseph, in Buchanan County, Missouri. The route runs for about under the monikers of Stockyards Expressway and South Second Street beginning at an intersection with West Florence Road. The southern terminus of Route 759 is at an at-grade intersection with Southwest Lower Lake Road in the stockyards section of the city. Paralleling two railroad lines, Interstate 229 (I-229) and the nearby Missouri River, Route 759 eventually weaves for more dense parts of the city, intersecting with U.S. Route 36 (US 36) before merging northbound into I-229 and US 59\\. ==Route description== Route 759 begins at an intersection with Southwest Lower Lake Road and Packers Avenue in the stockyards section of St. Joseph. The route heads to the northeast as a divided arterial boulevard known as the Stockyards Expressway, paralleling two large rail yards through a large industrial portion of the city. After the intersection with West Florence Road, Route 759 changes monikers from Stockyards Expressway to South Second Street. At that point, the route makes a gradual bend to the north along with the nearby Missouri River, becoming Stockyards Expressway once again as it parallels I-229 and US 59\\. The route then enters an interchange with US 36, which crosses the Missouri River nearby. After the interchange, Route 759 becomes a highway ramp and merges into I-229 northbound and its parent US 59\\. The designation of Route 759 terminates at the merge near downtown Saint Joseph. ==Junction list== ==References== ==External links== *Missouri Road Photo Gallery 759 Category:Transportation in Buchanan County, Missouri ",
