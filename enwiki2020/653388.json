    "text": "Poison Idea is an American punk rock band formed in Portland, Oregon in 1980. The band originally dissolved in 1993, but has been playing intermittently since 1998. They officially disbanded as of January 1, 2017 and reunited in 2018. ==History== ===Formation, 1980s, and 1990s=== Poison Idea was formed in 1980 by vocalist Jerry A. (aka Jerry Lang). The initial lineup consisted of Jerry A., Chris Tense (guitar), Glen Estes (bass), and Dean Johnson (drums). Inspired by Black Flag and other early Southern California hardcore acts, they were further influenced by Discharge and Los Angeles's Germs. Germs singer Darby Crash's influence on singer Jerry A., vocally, lyrically, and philosophically, was considerable, and Poison Idea followed the Germs' extremist punk ethic. Tense, who previously had played with Jerry in a group called the Stand, was replaced within a year by Tom \"Pig Champion\" Roberts (guitar), formerly of the Imperialist Pigs. Poison Idea's debut, 1983's Pick Your King EP was a short, lo-fi blast of hardcore fury. The jacket featured a \"choice\" of two kings, Jesus (front cover) and Elvis Presley (back cover). In 1984, Chris Tense returned to the band, this time on bass, replacing Glen Estes (later of Portland, Oregon punk/metal band Final Warning), and the group released the Record Collectors Are Pretentious Assholes 12\" (the cover features Pig Champion's substantial vinyl collection). The record found the band incorporating subtle rock elements into their music, which was further honed on their contributions to two 1985 compilations, \"Laughing Boy\" on the Drinking is Great EP (on which appeared other Oregon punk bands Final Warning, Lockjaw and E-13), and \"Typical\" and \"Die on Your Knees\" on the Cleanse the Bacteria LP (compiled by Pushead for his own Pusmort label). With the release of 1986's Kings of Punk LP, Poison Idea had fully moved beyond the breakneck hardcore of their early records to a potent, driving and ultimately more intricate and sophisticated hardcore/hard rock fusion that incorporated the accessibility of hard rock without sacrificing the power of hardcore. Following the release of Kings of Punk, the band went through several rapid lineup changes (mostly in the rhythm section), and then added lead guitarist Eric \"Vegetable\" Olson, a gifted musician who wrote many Poison Idea tunes during his tenure in the band (even contributing a piano vamp on one track). The band then released War All the Time (named for the Charles Bukowski book) in 1987. War All the Time and the EPs that followed (the Getting the Fear 12\" and the Filthkick 7\") found them further developing the rock/hardcore sound first established on Kings of Punk, which they would hone in 1990 with Feel the Darkness. Around this time, after numerous lineup changes, Poison Idea had convened one of their more stable lineups in Jerry A., Tom \"Pig Champion\" Roberts, Charley \"Myrtle Tickner\" Nims (bass) and Steve \"Thee Slayer Hippy\" Hanford (drums), with Kid Cocksman and then Aldine Strichnine on second guitar. By this time, their drinking habits and hard living were beginning to catch up with them: the band weighed in at about 1,300 lb. collectively, and Pig Champion in particular was very fat, often having to play sitting down. They also established their own record label in 1989, American Leather (named for the Germs song), and released two records the same year: a reissue of their 1982 demo Darby Crash Rides Again and the Discontent 7\". In 1990, the band released Feel the Darkness. After the album's release, Aldine Strychnine was thrown out of the band, and Mondo returned this time on guitar, for the 1991 tour. Poison Idea then released Blank Blackout Vacant in 1992, and, before seemingly splitting in 1993, they released We Must Burn. When Pig Champion left the band in 1993, shortly before the recording and release of the live album on Your Choice Records produced by Tobby Holzinger, Poison Idea effectively called it quits. Jerry A pursued a solo project called Gift with his wife and Thee Slayer Hippy. In 1998 the original line-up reunited for a 7\" EP released on Taang! (who reissued their early catalogue), but broke up following an aborted tour. Reflex/Wolfpack Records also did two vinyl reissues of the band. First Kings of Punk in 2003. Then later in 2005 a compilation 12\" containing the Pick Your King EP and the 'Learning To Scream' EP. ===Reformation and recent events=== Jerry A reformed the band in late 1999 with the line up featuring Tom \"Pig Champion\" Roberts (guitar), Matt Brainard (guitar), Chris Carey (bass) and Chris Cuthbert (drums), and after breaking in the new lineup the band toured the east coast in 2002 including an appearance at CBGB's, with also a couple of trips to Texas and California. Matt Brainard was busy with Defiance and decided that two full-time touring bands was too much and elected to leave the band. Jimmy Taylor was hired as guitarist for Poison Idea as the band was planning a 6-week tour of Europe and became a permanent member of the band. They toured Europe twice in 2003 and 2004, with Eric Eggroll on guitar during 2003 and Joe Spleen (The Gits) during 2004 filling in for Pig Champion on the road. In 2004 Poison Idea was invited to go on a tour in Japan as a 4 piece with Japanese punk legends Forward. They were well received in the other countries they toured, inspiring the band to put together a new record. Back home in Portland, the new line up (Jerry A, Pig Champion, Jimmy Taylor, Chris Carey and Chris Cuthbert) began working on material which later became \"Latest Will and Testament\", recorded in 2005 at Smegma recording studio in Portland, Oregon. On January 31, 2006 guitarist Tom \"Pig Champion\" Roberts died at the age of 47 in his Portland home of undetermined causes, although he had been suffering from the flu and an untreated kidney infection. The band had recorded the new record and it was ready for release when he died. Pig Champion had wanted the record to be called Latest Will and Testament, a name that the rest of the band liked. After his death Jerry commented that Pig Champion probably knew something that the rest of them did not. The album was released in May 2006 on Farewell Records. The band did not play a record release show, or any show for over a year as they tried to get used to the idea that their friend was gone. In 2007, Poison Idea again reformed to play shows in support of a split 7\" single with Kill Your Idols (for TKO Records). The lineup for this incarnation was Jerry A., Chris Cuthbert (drums), Jimmy Taylor (guitar), Matt Brainard (guitar) and Rob Hume (bass). On October 6, 2008 Portland police arrested Steve \"Thee Slayer Hippy\" Hanford, 39, in connection with a string of pharmacy robberies in late summer.The Oregonian \u2013 Portland Man, 39, is arrested in pharmacy robberies Tips to Crime Stoppers helped Portland police arrest Steven Judd Hanford, 39, in connection with a string of pharmacy robberies in late summer. Hanford was arraigned Tuesday in Multnomah County Circuit Court. His next court date is October 15. In December 2011, Brainard was replaced by guitarist Jeff Walter. In 2012, after playing two dates each in both Portland and Seattle, the band embarked on a five-week tour of Europe during June and July. The tour spanned eleven countries and featured the band playing nearly thirty dates in Sweden, Germany, Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy, Czech Republic, Austria, Belgium, Denmark and Finland. During this tour, Jerry developed a severe infection in his foot and was instructed by medical staff in Europe to return home immediately. Despite a long-standing reputation for not completing tours, the band remained in Europe for the entire five weeks, resulting in Jerry having to have two toes and a portion of his foot removed when the band returned to the U.S. The European tour of 2012 was the last time Cuthbert and Hume played with the band. Via social media, the band announced that they were looking for a new rhythm section and tried out various drummers and bass players during 2013 and 2013. The band distributed a video announcement, in early October, 2013 announcing that Natalie Lucio would now be playing bass. Jim Taylor of Amphead is no longer in the band, widely believed to be because of the birth of his first child. Furthermore, it was announced that Eric \"Vegetable\" Olson would be rejoining the band on guitar after an almost 25-year absence. Olson is best known for his work on the War All The Time album as well as the Filthkick EP. In October, 2014, the band played at a Burnside Skate Park Anniversary Show in Portland. On May 28, 2015, Poison Idea announced that they were taking a hiatus to \"address some health issues and personal matters.\" After a 19 month absence, the band returned for one show on July 21, 2018 at the Bossanova Ballroom in Portland, Oregon. It was in celebration of the release of Feel the Darkness 28 years prior. A remixed and remastered album including B-sides, outtakes, alternate mixes, plus Live in London, has been re-issued by American Leather / TKO Records. In December 2018, Metallica performed a cover of Poison Idea's \"Taken By Surprise\" at the Moda Center, in Portland, Oregon. It was stated that in Portland, at the Northwest Hesh Fest, September 19\u201321, 2019, the band would, \"reportedly play their last-ever hometown show.\" Steven \"Thee Slayer Hippy\" Hanford, the band's former drummer, died of heart attack at age 50 on May 22, 2020. ==Legacy== Poison Idea has been cited as an influence by bands and musicians such as Nirvana, Zeke, Turbonegro, Eyehategod, Pantera, Napalm Death, Machine Head, Emperor's B\u00e5rd \"Faust\" Eithun, and Ratos de Por\u00e3o.
