Department stores in Japan are referred to as hyakkaten () or dep\u0101to (\u30c7\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8), an alteration of the English term. ==History== The first \"modern-style\" department store in Japan was Mitsukoshi, founded in 1904, which has its root as a kimono store called Echigoya from 1673. When the roots are considered, however, Matsuzakaya has an even longer history, dated from 1611. The kimono store changed to a department store in 1910. In 1924, Matsuzakaya store in Ginza allowed street shoes to be worn indoors, something innovative at the time. Matsuzakaya corporate history These former kimono shop department stores dominated the market in its earlier history. They sold, or instead displayed, luxurious products, which contributed to their sophisticated atmospheres. Another origin of the Japanese department store is from railway companies. There have been many private railway operators in the nation and, from the 1920s, they started to build department stores directly linked to their lines' termini. Seibu and Hankyu are typical examples of this type. ==Characteristics== Since the 1980s, Japanese department stores have been facing fierce competition from supermarkets and convenience stores, gradually losing their presence. Still, dep\u0101to are bastions of several aspects of cultural conservatism in the country. Giving gift certificates for prestigious department stores is used as a formal present in Japan. Department stores in Japan generally offer a wide range of services and can include foreign exchange, travel reservations, ticket sales for local concerts and other events. Due to their roots, many Japanese department stores have sections devoted to kimono and traditional Japanese crafts, including pottery and lacquerware. The basement level usually has a grocery and food court, and on the roof may be garden and aquatic supplies, pets, and a children's play area. Operating hours are usually from 10 am to 8 pm. Some close one day a week, often a weekday. ==Famous department stores in Japan== Some stores also have branches outside Japan. ===Nationwide=== * ** ** * * ** ** * (fashion oriented, nationwide) * ** (hobby oriented, nationwide) ** ** * * ===Hokkaido=== * - part of Istean Mitsukoshi Holdings ===Kant\u014d region=== * * (fashion oriented) * (fashion oriented) * * * * **109 (Ichi-maru-ky\u016b) (fashion oriented, Kant\u014d region) ** (hobby oriented, nationwide) ===Ch\u016bbu region=== * * * ===Kansai region=== * * * * * * ===Ch\u016bgoku, Shikoku region=== * * * * ===Ky\u016bsh\u016b region=== * - part of Istean Mitsukoshi Holdings * * * * * * * ===Defunct in Japan=== * * (from France) * (from Sogo & Seibu) == See also == == References == * Category:Retailing in Japan ",
