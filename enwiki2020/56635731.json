The hotel was part of a community development plan to develop businesses that did not depend on mining. featured 20 rooms and three baths, but the bathrooms were originally located in a separate stable building. The hotel was bought by Gustav and Anna Sundby in 1914, who operated the hotel into the 1940s. In the 1950s the hotel became an apartment house. The hotel was restored in the 2000s and is once more a hotel.
