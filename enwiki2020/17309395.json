The house was moved from Washington Street to this location in 1895, occasioned by the widening of the railroad right-of-way next to that road. ==See also== * Dr. Henry Jacob Bigelow House, Newton, Massachusetts * National Register of Historic Places listings in Newton, Massachusetts ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Newton, Massachusetts Category:Houses completed in 1830 Category:1830 establishments in Massachusetts Category:Greek Revival houses in Massachusetts ",
