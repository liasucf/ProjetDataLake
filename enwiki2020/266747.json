    "text": "The term wired intelligence refers to a robot that has no programmed microprocessor. Instead, the robot has a particular connection of wires and analog electronics between its sensors and motors that gives it seemingly intelligent actions. These actions can be complex enough to create a quadruped robot that seeks out the brightest light source. The groundwork for these theories is laid in \"Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology\" by Valentino Braitenberg. ==See also== * BEAM robotics Category:Robotics ",
