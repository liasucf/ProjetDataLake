    "text": "\"Everywhere\" is a song written by Mike Reid and Craig Wiseman, and performed by American country music singer Tim McGraw. It was released in July 1997 as the second single from his album of the same name. The song reached the top of the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart and peaked at number 2 on the RPM Country Tracks chart in Canada. Despite reaching Number One on Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (Now Hot Country Songs), the song did not appear on McGraw's Greatest Hits album. It did, however, later appear on his second Greatest Hits package, Reflected: Greatest Hits Vol. 2. ==Content== The narrator describes a former significant other and her decision to end their relationship after a disagreement over their future together as a couple \u2014 he foresees plans on leaving the small community in which they were both born and raised, and live a life of travel in hopes that she would accompany him in such life, but she steadfastly insists in staying in said community. Almost from the instant that the narrator begins his traveling life, he claims that he sees his significant other, albeit in spirit, appearing in every destination in North America that he visits. Furthermore, whenever he does return to their hometown, he is regularly informed by its residents of her new life \u2014 she has married another man and they have subsequently started a family together. And although the narrator reaches the conclusion that his significant other is no longer in his life, he nevertheless proclaims that he will eternally carry her spirit with him in his travels with great emotion just as he always has. ==Critical reception== Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe gave the song an A grade, saying that its \"understated delivery packs the song with such emotional heft that the unresolved sadness lingers after the song has ended.\" He goes on to call it the moment where McGraw discovers \"subtlety and finds it suits him quite well.\"CountryUniverse.net Song review == Music video == The music video was directed by Sherman Halsey, who has also directed virtually all of McGraw's other videos. ==Lawsuit== In 2007, songwriter James Martinez filed a $20 million lawsuit against McGraw, Reid and Wiseman. The suit alleges that McGraw lifted \u201cEverywhere\u201d from an audio cassette tape containing Martinez' original track \"Anytime, Anywhere, Amanda.\" Martinez provided the cassette to the same songwriters who wrote the song \"Everywhere\" for McGraw's 1997 album of the same name. The suit also alleges that McGraw and other defendants internationally released and distributed the \u201cEverywhere\u201d album containing their infringing copies of a song substantially similar to the Martinez's song. McGraw's attorneys stated that they are confident the case will be dismissed altogether, and described the allegations as being \"totally without merit.\" In August 2008, the lawsuit was transferred from Texas to the federal district court in Nashville, Tennessee. The lawsuit is ongoing as of 2017, with Martinez now being represented by Bill Ramey of Ramey & Browning in Houston, Texas.Gilbert, Clavin. \"Tim McGraw Copyright Infringement Suit Grabbing Attention\", CMT.com\", August 6, 2008.
