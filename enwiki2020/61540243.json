    "text": "The Women's Professional Snooker Championship was a snooker tournament run from 1934 to 1950 by the Women's Billiards Association. The event was the world championship for female players during this time. Ruth Harrison was the most successful player, winning eight of the ten events. The event was later replaced by the World Women's Snooker Championship. ==History== The tournament was held ten times from 1934 to 1950, with a break from 1941 to 1947. Only four different players reached the final during its existence, with Ruth Harrison winning eight of the ten events. The first tournaments were held at Burroughes Hall, London, and the tournaments after the break were held at Leicester Square Hall, London. The last time that the tournament was held, in 1950, Thelma Carpenter won, a few days after winning the World Women's Billiards Championship title. This proved to be the last time the tournament was held, as public interest in the contest declined. Although the competition was billed as a World Championship, no players from outside the United Kingdom participated. Agnes Morris, the 1949 champion (and three-times runner-up), later competed in the World Women's Snooker Championship under her married name of Agnes Davies, and reached the final in 1980. ==Finals== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"text-align: center; background-color: #00af00\" | Year ! style=\"text-align: center; background-color: #00af00\" | Winner ! style=\"text-align: center; background-color: #00af00\" | Runner-up ! style=\"text-align: center; background-color: #00af00\" | Final score ! style=\"text-align: center; background-color: #00af00\" | Venue |- | 1934 | Ruth Harrison | Joyce Gardner | align = \"center\" | 7\u20136 | align=\"left\"| Burroughes Hall, London |- | 1935 | Ruth Harrison | Joyce Gardner | align = \"center\" | 7\u20135 | align=\"left\"| Burroughes Hall, London |- | 1936 | Ruth Harrison | Thelma Carpenter | align = \"center\" | 7\u20133 | align=\"left\"| Burroughes Hall, London |- | 1937 | Ruth Harrison | Joyce Gardner | align = \"center\" | 9\u20134 | align=\"left\"| Burroughes Hall, London |- | 1938 | Ruth Harrison | Thelma Carpenter | align = \"center\" | 11\u20132 | align=\"left\"| Burroughes Hall, London |- | 1939 | Ruth Harrison | Thelma Carpenter | align = \"center\" | 8\u20135 | align=\"left\"| Burroughes Hall, London |- | 1940 | Ruth Harrison | Agnes Morris | align = \"center\" | 11\u20132 | align=\"left\"| Burroughes Hall, London |- | 1941\u20131947 | align = \"center\" colspan = \"4\" rowspan= \"1\" | No tournament held |- | 1948 | Ruth Harrison | Agnes Morris | align = \"center\" |16\u201314 | align=\"left\"| Leicester Square Hall, London |- | 1949 | Agnes Morris | Thelma Carpenter | align = \"center\" | 16\u201315 | align=\"left\"| Leicester Square Hall, London |- | 1950 | Thelma Carpenter | Agnes Morris | align = \"center\" | 20\u201310 | align=\"left\"| Leicester Square Hall, London |} ==Finals \u2013 Statistics by player== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:100%; text-align: center;\" |- !
