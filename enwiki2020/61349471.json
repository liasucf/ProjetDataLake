    "text": "Maxim Kaibkhanovich Dadashev (; ; September 30, 1990 \u2013 July 23, 2019) was a Russian boxer who competed in the light-welterweight (63.5 kg) division. A participant of the 2015 European Games, Dadashev was a Russian amateur champion. Born in Leningrad, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia), he was of Lezgin descent. ==Amateur career== As an amateur, Dadashev was the 2008 Youth World Championships silver medalist at in Guadalajara, Mexico. Dadashev continued his amateur career into college; he studied at Baltic State Technical University and graduated with a degree in sports management. In 2010 and 2012, Dadashev was the Russian National Championships bronze medalist at , and also was the 2013 Russian National Championships silver medalist at . ==Professional career== Trained by former world champion Buddy McGirt in Oxnard, California, Dadashev won his first 13 professional bouts, 11 of them knockouts or technical knockouts. In his professional debut in April 2016, he won with a first-round knockout of Darin Hampton. Dadashev won the vacant WBC- NABF light-welterweight title in June 2018 with a tenth-round stoppage of Darleys P\u00e9rez, and defended it in October 2018 with a ten-round decision win over former WBC lightweight champion Antonio DeMarco. ==Death== On July 19, 2019, Dadashev fought Subriel Mat\u00edas as part of a Top Rank event aired by ESPN at the MGM National Harbor in Oxon Hill, Maryland. The fight was an IBF light- welterweight title elimination bout with the winner receiving a shot at the title. Dadashev lost via stoppage after his trainer, Buddy McGirt, asked the referee to stop the contest at the end of the eleventh round. Dadashev, losing significantly on the official scorecards, protested but McGirt overruled him believing that he could not take any more punishment; McGirt later said he had considered doing so two rounds earlier as he felt his fighter was fading and taking too many hits. Dadashev needed help to get out of the ring and was unable to make it to his dressing room before he collapsed and vomited in the corridor. He was rushed to the University of Maryland Prince George's Hospital Center, where he was diagnosed with a subdural hematoma and underwent emergency surgery to stop the bleeding. He was then placed in an induced coma to try to allow the swelling in his brain to subside. However, Dadashev's condition worsened and on July 23 he died in the hospital. He is survived by his wife, Elizaveta, and a son. ===Aftermath=== The Boxing Federation of Russia launched an investigation into the tragedy, and pledged to support Dadashev's family financially. The Maryland State Athletic Commission will also conduct an investigation. Dadashev's body is planned to be sent to his hometown of Saint Petersburg, Russia, for funeral services and burial. Promoter Bob Arum will pay for the funeral expenses, and a GoFundMe page was setup to raise funds for Dadashev's wife and son. The farewell ceremony took place in Petergof on August 4. ==Professional boxing record== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\" |- ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Age !Location !Notes |- |14 |Loss |13\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Subriel Mat\u00edas | |11 (12), |Jul 19, 2019 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |- |13 |Win |13\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Ricky Sismundo |KO |4 (10), |Mar 23, 2019 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |12 |Win |12\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Antonio DeMarco |UD |10 |Oct 20, 2018 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |- |11 |Win |11\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Darleys P\u00e9rez |TKO |10 (10), |Jun 9, 2018 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |10 |Win |10\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Abdiel Ram\u00edrez |TKO |5 (8), |Mar 10, 2018 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |- |9 |Win |9\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Clarence Booth |KO |4 (8), |Nov 11, 2017 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |8 |Win |8\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Jose Marrufo |KO |8 (8), |Aug 5, 2017 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |7 |Win |7\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Bilal Mahasin |KO |3 (8), |Apr 22, 2017 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |6 |Win |6\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Jerome Rodriguez |KO |6 (6), |Jan 27, 2017 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |5 |Win |5\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Efrain Cruz |TKO |2 (6), |Nov 26, 2016 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |4 |Win |4\u20130 |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Eddie Diaz | |6 |Oct 14, 2016 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |3 |Win |3\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Jason Gavino | |4 (6), |Jul 16, 2016 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |- |2 |Win |2\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Rashad Bogar |KO |4 (6), |May 14, 2016 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |1 |Win |1\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Darin Hampton | |1 (4), |Apr 2, 2016 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |} ==References== ==See also== *List of deaths due to injuries sustained in boxing *Traumatic brain injury ==External links== * Category:1990 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Boxers at the 2015 European Games Category:Deaths due to injuries sustained in boxing Category:European Games competitors for Russia Category:Filmed deaths in sports Category:Light-welterweight boxers Category:Russian male boxers Category:Russian people of Lezgian descent Category:Sports deaths in Maryland Category:Sportspeople from Saint Petersburg ",
