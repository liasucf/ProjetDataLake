    "text": "K-190 is a east-west state highway in the U.S. state of Kansas. K-190's western terminus is at U.S. Route 160 (US-160) east of the community of Hickok, and the eastern terminus is at US-83 and US-160 south of the city of Sublette. K-190 is co-designated as US-56 in the city of Satanta. K-190 was first designated as a state highway on December 22, 1954. ==Route description== K-190 begins at an intersection with US-160 and begins traveling southward and after roughly it crosses the Cimarron Valley Railroad in Ryus. After another approximately it curves to the east and after another crosses into Haskell County and curves southeast. From here it begins to parallel the railroad for before intersecting US-56 at the Satanta city limits. From here it overlaps US-56 through Satanta, then leaves US-56 after . From US-56 it heads south for where it enters into Seward County. From here it continues south for then curves east. It continues east for roughly and intersects Rural Secondary 310 (RS-310). From RS-310, K-190 continues another and reaches its eastern terminus at US-83 and US-160. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) tracks the traffic levels on its highways, and in 2017, they determined that on average the traffic varied from 200 vehicles per day near the eastern terminus to 1425 vehicles per day along the concurrency with US-56. K-190 is not included in the National Highway System. The National Highway System is a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. K-190 does connect to the National Highway System at its eastern terminus at US-83 and US-160. The entire route is paved with partial design bituminous pavement except the section concurrent with US-56, which is composite pavement. ==History== In three separate resolutions on August 11, 1954, it was passed, that once Grant, Haskell and Seward Counties had furnished a right of way of 100 feet wide that the road would be added to the state highway system. Haskell County finished their section by November 1, 1954, Grant County by December 6, 1954, and Seward County by December 20, 1954. Then in a December 22, 1954 resolution, the road was designated as K-190 and added to the state highway system. ==Major intersections== ==References== ==External links== *Kansas Department of Transportation State Map *KDOT: Historic State Maps 190 Category:Transportation in Seward County, Kansas Category:Transportation in Haskell County, Kansas Category:Transportation in Grant County, Kansas ",
