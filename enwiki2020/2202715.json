    "text": "Hilmar \u00d6rn Hilmarsson (; born 23 April 1958), also known as H\u00d6H, is a musician, an art director, and allsherjargo\u00f0i (chief go\u00f0i) of \u00c1satr\u00faarf\u00e9lagi\u00f0 (\"the \u00c1satr\u00fa Association\"). Hilmar \u00d6rn Hilmarsson was a pioneer in the use of computers when composing music and cleared the path for new ideas in recording and arrangements. He has worked on ambitious, experimental and original projects with various musicians, such as Psychic TV, Current 93, Sigur R\u00f3s, Steind\u00f3r Andersen and Eiv\u00f8r P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir. ==From early bands to the birth of \u00deeyr== From 1972 to 1975 he was playing drums in a school band called Fatima with guitarist J\u00f3hannes Helgason, bassist Birgir Ott\u00f3son and singer Gu\u00f0mundur Eyj\u00f3lfsson. In 1974 singer Eir\u00edkur Hauksson replaced Gu\u00f0mundur and guitarist Sigurgeir Sigmundsson joined them and a year after they broke up. By 1979 Hilmar \u00d6rn was playing drums and occasionally the synthesizer in a band called Fellibylur (Hurricane) with vocalist Magn\u00fas Gu\u00f0mundsson and bassist Hilmar \u00d6rn Agnarsson. The band was expanded with the arrival of singers El\u00edn Reynisd\u00f3ttir, guitarist J\u00f3hannes Helgason and drummer Sigtryggur Baldursson and with the new line-up, they created a new band called Frostr\u00f3sir (Frost Roses) that played mainly disco music. The band changed their name to \u00deeyr and released the debut album in December 1980 with the title \u00deaga\u00f0 \u00ed Hel which contained some lyrics written by Hilmar \u00d6rn. \u00deeyr underwent internal changes and Eir\u00edkur left the band and guitarists Gu\u00f0laugur Kristinn \u00d3ttarsson and \u00deorsteinn Magn\u00fasson joined in. The music evolved dramatically with the new members and El\u00edn and J\u00f3hannes left the band. The new \u00deeyr became very famous in Iceland with \u00datfrymi and Mj\u00f6tvi\u00f0ur M\u00e6r, among other releases, and Hilmar \u00d6rn collaborated with them with some lyrics and art works, and also managed the band from 1981 to 1982 with Gu\u00f0ni Ragnar Agnarsson creating Esquimaux Management (Eskvim\u00f3, in Icelandic), an independent record label and book publisher. \u00deeyr held a deep interest in science, magic and philosophy and Hilmar \u00d6rn served as an influential figure. Gu\u00f0ni and Hilmar withdrew from the band\u2019s management in 1983 and were replaced by Gu\u00f0mundur Sigurfreyr J\u00f3nason, the same year \u00deeyr disbanded. ==Other projects and collaborations== In 1984 Gu\u00f0laugur Kristinn \u00d3ttarsson and singer Bj\u00f6rk Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir, who at that time were in Kukl formed the Elgar Sisters, Hilmar joined them next to Einar Arnaldur Melax, Sigtryggur Baldursson, \u00deorsteinn Magn\u00fasson and Birgir Mogensen to record 11 songs from 1984 to 1986 and disbanded afterwards. The Elgar Sisters did not release any album, but some of their works were featured during the solo careers of Bj\u00f6rk and Gu\u00f0laugur. In 1987 Hilmar began to work with Current 93, a band led by David Tibet and collaborated with 10 releases, among them, he produced the single Crowleymass in 1987 and in 1991 produced Island, an album which featured singer Bj\u00f6rk as backing vocalist on the song \u201cFalling\u201d. He also collaborated with the band Ornamental in 1988. M\u00d6K Trio was a group formed by bassist T\u00f3mas Magn\u00fas T\u00f3masson (known by his work in Stu\u00f0menn), Hilmar \u00d6rn and Gu\u00f0laugur Kristinn \u00d3ttarsson. In fact, the name stemmed from the initials corresponding to the middle name of each member. Their first gig was by 1992. M\u00d6K Trio did not play regularly and they never released any album. Their last presentation was in August 2001 at Galdrah\u00e1t\u00ed\u00f0in \u00e1 Str\u00f6ndum, Reykjav\u00edk. In 1992 he started to record with singer and trumpet player Einar \u00d6rn Benediktsson (from the Sugarcubes) on a new project called Frostbite and released an album titled The Second Coming the following year through label One Little Indian, but after this, the band was dissolved. His collaborations continued with sound engineer Andrew McKenzie in the Hafler Trio (H3\u00d6H) and in 1993 released an album called Bootleg H3\u00d6H which contained remixes from Frostbite. By November 1997 Hilmar and Einar \u00d6rn joined drummer Sigtryggur Baldursson to form Grindverk. After signing with FatCat Records they released their debut album, a 12-inch vinyl titled Gesundheit von K on 1 January 1999. With 4 tracks, Gesundheit von K encompassed a wide range of styles: from the industrial funk of the title song to the exotic jazz of \u201cKastrato\u201d. Grindverk showed with this album a dark music, with free instruments proper of the funk music or post industrialism of the eighties but in the context of the nineties. They were supposed to release an album called T.h.e.r.a.p.i.s.t.s by July 1999, but it was canceled as Grindverk disbanded shortly after their debut release. Hilmar \u00d6rn & Sigur R\u00f3s: In 2000 he collaborated with Sigur R\u00f3s on the soundtrack to the film Angels of the Universe, which was directed by Fri\u00f0rik \u00de\u00f3r Fri\u00f0riksson. This seventeen-track album contained fifteen songs composed by H\u00d6H with his mellow soothing trademark sound (classical guitars, strings and synthesizers) and two songs created by Sigur R\u00f3s (\u201cB\u00edum B\u00edum Bambal\u00f3\u201d and \u201cD\u00e1narfregnir og Jar\u00f0afarir\u201d). Later, he also worked with Sigur R\u00f3s composing and performing on \u201cHrafnagaldr \u00d3\u00f0ins\u201d. GVDL: Was another music project formed in 2001 with Gu\u00f0laugur K. \u00d3ttarsson and bass player Georg Bjarnason. The group was established for the arrival in Iceland by the American band Fuck. In fact, the name of the band were the initials of the American group shifted one place further. They only had one performance at Kaffi Reykjav\u00edk, without recording any track. In 2004 Hilmar \u00d6rn collaborated with singer Eiv\u00f8r P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir in a joint project between Iceland and Ireland and performed with other musicians from both countries in two concerts, one in Reykjav\u00edk and the other in T\u00f3rshavn, in the Faroe Islands. ==Score music compositions== From 1981 onward, Hilmar \u00d6rn Hilmarsson has composed music for several movies, both Icelandic and foreign, and worked with film directors such as Henning Carlsen (Pan, 1995), Jane Campion (In the Cut, 2003) and Fri\u00f0rik \u00de\u00f3r Fri\u00f0riksson (Brennu- Nj\u00e1lssaga, 1981 - Skytturnar, 1987 - B\u00f6rn N\u00e1tt\u00farunnar, 1991 - B\u00ed\u00f3dagar, 1994 - Cold Fever, 1995 - Dj\u00f6flaeyjan, 1996 - Angels of the Universe, 2000 and Falcons, 2002). Hilmar \u00d6rn has received many awards for his contributions as a film composer. In 1993 he won the European Film Composer of the Year for his work on the Oscar nominated Children of Nature, the film by Fri\u00f0riksson. ==From his interest on magic and the orgone therapy to the \u00c1satr\u00fa Association== Hilmar \u00d6rn joined the \u00c1satr\u00faarf\u00e9lagi\u00f0 (\u00c1satr\u00fa Association), the old pagan Norse religion, in 1974 when he was sixteen years old. As being interested in Aleister Crowley once, Hilmar \u00d6rn has always held interest in magic, witchcraft and paganism, as well as the work of Wilhelm Reich which is not only reflected through his influence on the musical works but also through an endeavor called Mi\u00f0gar\u00f0ur (Midgard). In an interview with Karl-Erik Seigfried in 2011, he described his relationship with the theories of Crowley: It was a center created in 1982 by him, Gu\u00f0laugur K. \u00d3ttarsson and Gu\u00f0mundur S. J\u00f3nason to promote the work of Reich by means of orgone therapists and lectures.\"He was looking for the wrong gods....he was a failed teacher...Don\u2019t go down that road, because it will end in tears.\" Hilmar \u00d6rn was ordained as allsherjargo\u00f0i or chief go\u00f0i of the \u00c1satr\u00faarf\u00e9lagi\u00f0 during a formal ceremony held on 4 July 2003. He is a recognized authority on indigenous Norse paganism. ==Personal life== Hilmar \u00d6rn's parents were Hilmar \u00d3lafsson (1936\u20131986), an architect, and Rannveig Hr\u00f6nn Kristinsd\u00f3ttir (born 1937). He is married to the writer Ragna Sigur\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir. He is the father of two sons and two daughters.Fann sinn farveg \u00ed t\u00f3nlistinni og \u00e1satr\u00fanni. 23 April 2018.
