    "text": "Eopauropus balticus is a prehistoric pauropod known from mid-Eocene Baltic amber. It is the only known pauropod in the fossil record. As pauropods are normally soil-dwelling, their presence in amber (fossilized tree sap) is unusual, and they are the rarest known animals in Baltic amber. ==References== Category:Prehistoric myriapods Category:Baltic amber Category:Fossil taxa described in 2001 ",
