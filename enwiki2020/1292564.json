    "text": "\"Ich will\" (German for I Want) is a single by Rammstein. It was originally released in Germany on 10 September 2001. Since it was released the day before the September 11, 2001 attacks, many channels did not air the music video (which was to debut on U.S. television the next evening). The German single contains a live cover version of The Ramones' song \"Pet Sematary\", sung by keyboardist Flake. ==Music video== The music video of \"Ich Will\" features the band members staging a bank robbery, making it seems realistic as possible. The video shows both the robbery and its aftermath, and moves between these two scenes. The robbery: The band is shown entering a bank wearing stockings over their heads, except for Flake, who has a very large and elaborate bomb strapped to his chest. They quickly remove their masks and head for the front desk. A bank employee reaches for the panic button, but she is seen by Richard, who presses her hand against the button, intentionally triggering the alarm. The woman faints, and Richard dances with her unconscious body until Ollie confirms that the German Polizei and Media have arrived. The group continues to terrorize the hostages and vandalize the bank, while also fantasizing about the media storm when they exit. In another room, Till is giving a live interview to the press, who appear to be slain in the next scene, though the broadcast continues. As the band (excluding Flake) exit the bank unarmed, they are swarmed by members of the Spezialeinsatzkommando instead of the media as anticipated. Despite this the band seems to revel in the attention they are getting, and shortly after the timer on Flake's bomb reaches zero. The video quickly flicks through a series of short clips from some of Rammstein's other music videos (Seemann, Du hast, Du riechst so gut '95, Du riechst so gut '98, Stripped and Sonne), then comes to an end. The aftermath: The band (Flake excluded) emerges from a police bus wearing shackles and prison attire. They are escorted by guards down a red carpet surrounded by a large cheering crowd and many cameras, toward a podium where they receive a Goldene Kamera (Golden Camera) award, a German version of the Emmy award. Behind the podium is the main entrance of the bank they destroyed earlier, with a large sepia picture of Flake over the door. (most of the \"aftermath\" is shown at the beginning of the clip, although it is also revisited later). In an interview, Rammstein described the music video of \"Ich will\" as being a demonstration of the media's obsession with a good story, as well as an illustration of the immortality that can be achieved by those who commit wrongs.*Making of \"Ich Will\" video, 11:30 \u2013 an interview with Rammstein The video was filmed in Berlin in the former State Council of the German Democratic Republic building (Staatsratsgeb\u00e4ude) which now houses the European School of Management and Technology. Official band website ==Live story== Along with \"Nebel\", \"Ich will\" was the only song from Mutter that was not played live in its demo form in the concert for members of the Fan Area on April 2000. Instead, it debuted on 1 May 2001, in another concert for members of the Fan Area. When played live, explosions are part of the performance, and it usually closes the show during festivals. It has been played paired with \"Sonne\" during the encores in every Rammstein concert up until Made in Germany 1995\u20132011 (tour), where \"Sonne\" opened the show while \"Ich will\" maintained its position in the encore. ==Track listing== Maxi-single # Ich will (Album Version) - 3:37 # Ich will (Live Preussag Arena, Hannover, Germany on 1 June 2001) - 4:17 # Ich will (Westbam Mix) - 6:19 # Ich will (Paul van Dyk Mix) - 6:13 # Pet Sematary (Performed live with Clawfinger) \\- 6:31 # Ich will (Live CD-R Track) - 4:05 * Comes as a 2-track CD with Ich will (Album Version) and Ich will (Live).
