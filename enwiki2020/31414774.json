    "text": "The Bill Duthie Booksellers' Choice Award is a literary prize awarded annually by the BC Book Prizes for the \"best book in terms of public appeal, initiative, design, production and content.\" The prize is shared by the author and publisher. To qualify, the publisher must be located in British Columbia or the Yukon and in full creative control (editing, design and production). The winner, unlike the other prizes which are determined by judges, is selected by ballot sent to bookstores across the province of British Columbia. ==History== The award is named in honour of BC bookseller Bill Duthie who founded Duthie Books in 1957., Award criteria and description. It was first awarded in 1985 and was one of the original four prizes awarded by the BC Book Prizes.
