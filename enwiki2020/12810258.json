    "text": "Bartosz Waglewski (Fisz) born March 19, 1978 in Warszawa, Poland is a Polish rap artist. He is the son of musician Wojciech Waglewski and older brother of Emade (Piotr Waglewski). He studied at Europejska Akademia Sztuk (EAS). The musical style of Fisz is unconventional. At the very beginning of his career he started out as a hip-hop artist, but went experimental soon after releasing Tworzywo Sztuczne \u2013 Wielki Ci\u0119\u017cki S\u0142o\u0144 in 2004. Fisz and his producer Emade seek inspiration in black music giving soul, funk and jazz touch to their projects. His lyrics are often based on wordplay. In 2008, he founded a rock band Kim Nowak together with his brother Emade and Micha\u0142 Sobolewski. The band released two studio albums, Kim Nowak (2010) and Wilk (2012). Internationally he gave concerts on stages of London, Berlin, Bordeaux, Calvi, Dijon, Marseille, Vienna, Budapest, Prague, Paris and Saint Vallier. == Discography == ===Solo albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\" | Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Sales |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" |POL |- ! scope=\"row\" |Polepione d\u017awi\u0119ki | * Released: June 26, 2000 * Label: Asfalt Records * Formats: CD || 48 | |- ! scope=\"row\" |Na wylot | * Released: September 24, 2001 * Label: Asfalt Records * Formats: CD || 4 | * POL: 15,000+ |- | colspan=\"20\" style=\"font-size:90%\" | \"\u2014\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. |} ===Collaborative albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\" | Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Sales ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Certifications |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" |POL |- ! scope=\"row\" |Fru!
