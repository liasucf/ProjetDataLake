Newton was married to Cornelia Collins. In 1811, Newton authored Return to Nature: Or a Defence of the Vegetable Regimen.Preece, Rod. (2008). Sins of the Flesh: A History of Ethical Vegetarian Thought. UBC Press. p. 13. Newton's book was written to popularize the research of William Lambe. He promoted a \"regimen of distilled water and vegetable diet.\" He believed that vegetables are the natural food of man and animal flesh is unhealthy and unnatural. Newton recommended people to utilize distillation apparatus for their water. He resided at Chester Street, Belgravia and argued that the water from the River Thames was polluted by \"animal oil\" and \"septic matter\". His diet was ovo- lacto vegetarian and consisted of fruits, vegetables, raisins, toasted bread, distilled water, eggs, milk and potatoes. Twenty-five people were practicing the diet in 1811, including seven from Newton's own household and all reported good health. Newton's book inspired John Snow to adopt the diet. Unlike William Lambe, Newton was not a vegan. Newton commented that: > Our breakfast is composed of dried fruits, whether raisins, figs, or plums, > with toasted bread or biscuits, and weak tea, always made of distilled > water, with a moderation portion of milk in it... When butter is added to > the toast, it is in a very small quantity. The dinner consists of potatoes, > with some other vegetables, according as they happen to be in season, > macaroni, a tart, or a pudding, with as few eggs in it as possible: to this > is sometimes added a dessert.Newton, John Frank. (1821). The Return to > Nature: Or, A Defence of the Vegetable Regimen. London. pp. 113-114 Newton met Percy Bysshe Shelley during 1812-1813 and influenced his views on vegetarianism.Clark, David Lee. (1939). The Date and Source of Shelley's \"A Vindication of Natural Diet\". Studies in Philology 36 (1): 70-76.Hodgart, Patricia. (1985). A Preface to Shelley. Routledge. p. 182. Historian Keith Thomas has noted that Newton's Return to Nature \"provided much of the basis\" for Shelley's book, A Vindication of Natural Diet.Thomas, Keith. (1983). Man and the Natural World: A History of the Modern Sensibility. Pantheon Books. p. 296. Newton wrote a series of articles in The Monthly Magazine in 1812 which mention vegetarian dieting and the zodiac.Cameron, Kenneth Neill. (1970). Shelley and His Circle: 1773 - 1822, Volume 3. Harvard University Press. p. 234-244. Newton was a Zoroastrian and discussed the subject with his friend Thomas Love Peacock, in 1813. However, he did not write about the subject. Historian Stuart Curran has written that Newton's \"vegetarianism was both radical in its political implications and extraordinarily learned in its sources. Newton was obviously aware that both Zoroastrian and Indian religion enjoined a vegetable diet, but he grafted to his amalgamation a primitive zodiacal astrology.\"Curran, Stuart. (1975). Shelley's Annus Mirabilis: The Maturing of an Epic Vision. Huntington Library Press. p. 88. Lafayette Mendel credits Newton for starting the modern vegetarian movement.Lafayette B. Mendel. (1904).
