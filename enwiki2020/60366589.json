It is one of the fastest moving pulsars known, and has moved away from the location of its formation supernova, where the remaining supernova nebula, CTB 1 (Abell 85 ), is. Due to its speed in traversing the interstellar medium, at , it is leaving a long wake tail. The pulsar is currently away in the Cassiopeia constellation. The star rotates at a rate of 8.7 times a second. ==References== * * * ==External links== * AstroSurf, Abell 85 (CTB 1) Category:Pulsars Category:Cassiopeia (constellation) ",
