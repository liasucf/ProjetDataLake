    "text": "This Great Black Night is a 1998 EP by Weeping Tile. It was recorded following the band's departure from Warner Music Canada. It was sold only at live shows; the band toured that year as a supporting act for Ani DiFranco. The EP sold out, and is now considered a collector's item. However, three of the EP's five tracks were later rerecorded by Sarah Harmer on her 2000 solo album You Were Here, and another was rerecorded for her 2005 album I'm A Mountain. ==Track listing== All songs written by Sarah Harmer. #\"Weakened State\" #\"Lodestar\" #\"Odessa Nights\" #\"Coffee Stain\" #\"I'm A Mountain\" Category:Weeping Tile (band) albums Category:1998 EPs ",
