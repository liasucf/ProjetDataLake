    "text": "Superphenalene is a very large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with chemical formula C96H30. It can be formally considered to consist of three fused superbenzenes (hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene). It can be considered as an overlap structure of three hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronenes arranged symmetrically around a center. These have also been known as building blocks of molecular electronics since 2004 as they form self-assembling columns and nanotubes. == Occurrence == It is not known to occur naturally. == Properties == Planar geometry of superphenalene Superphenalene has a planar geometry. With 540,000 mesomeric boundary structures, it has significantly more than hexabenzocoronene (250), supernaphthalene (16,100) and also buckminsterfullerene (12,500). The molecule has a threefold symmetry axis perpendicular to the molecule (C3). == References == Category:Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ",
