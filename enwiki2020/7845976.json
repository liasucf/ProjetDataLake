It is also the name of the red wine produced by this property. The wine produced here was classified as one of fifteen Deuxi\u00e8mes Crus (Second Growths) in the original Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855. Ch\u00e2teau Cos d'Estournel produces the eponymous grand vin, the second wine since the 1994 vintage, Les Pagodes de Cos from the estate's younger vines, as well as Ch\u00e2teau Marbuzet from fruit of nearby plots. The property is adjacent to Ch\u00e2teau Lafite- Rothschild in the neighboring commune of Pauillac. ==History== The name Cos (with the S pronounced) refers to a \"hill of pebbles\" in Gascon dialect and the name Cos d'Estournel was given in 1810 by Louis-Gaspard d'Estournel. The estate has changed hands several times during its history, starting in 1852 when it was purchased by the English banker Charles Cecil Martyns. In 1869, it was sold to the Spanish Errazu family only to be sold again 20 years later in 1889 to the Bordeaux-based Hostein family. Through his marriage to Marie- Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Hostein, Louis-Victor Charmolue, who also owned Ch\u00e2teau Montrose, gained control of Cos d'Estournel in 1894. In in 1917, it was sold to Fernand Ginestet. The ch\u00e2teau has remained in the Ginestet family since then, becoming in 1970 part of Domaines Prats, the combined holdings of the Ginestet and Prats families, and controlled by Bruno Prats. In June 2008 it was announced that Michel Reybier, current owner of Cos d'Estournel, purchased Napa winery Chateau Montelena for an undisclosed sum. By November 2008, however, this agreement was cancelled, the termination of the transaction by Chateau Montelena stated to be due to that Reybier Investments had been \"unable to meet its obligations\". ==Production== From a 100 hectare estate, the vineyard area extends , divided into 30 parcels, primarily composed of the grape varieties of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot, with minor cultivation of Cabernet Franc and Petit verdot that appears to participate little in the modern production.bbr.com Ch\u00e2teau Cos d'Estournel The annual production is typically 32,000 cases.
