He was succeeded by his nephew, Diego Ronquillo. ==Governorship== His first official action was to order Manila to become Philippines's political and economic capital in 1582. That same year, he established the Palacio del Gobernador (Governor's Palace) in Intramuros, Manila to integrate all governmental activities in the Philippines. On March 30, 1582, he issued a decree stating that no person may leave the country without his permission. Ronquillo de Pe\u00f1alosa, according to the content of his order, was informed that some Franciscan priests headed by Fray Pedro de Alfaro left the country in 1579 heading for mainland China. Around March 1582, as he continues, Franciscan Fray Pablo de Jesus and other missionaries re- entered China where they disseminate scandalous talks about the colony. In June 1582, the first bishop of Manila Domingo de Salazar arrived at the Philippines. That same month, Jesuit missionaries successfully entered the Islands. Ronquillo de Pe\u00f1alosa also reported that they successfully conquered and annexed the last of Moluccan Islands\u2014the Tidore. He also reported to the King that the other island, Ternate was threatened by conquests and invasions from the British through Sir Francis Drake. In his dated letter of June 16, 1582, Ronquillo de Pe\u00f1alosa suggested to the King of Spain of further fortifications of Spanish footholds in the country. He also said that the Spaniards must dominate the Portuguese in Moluccas, and planned for possible seizing of Macau from Portugal. In a reply letter from the King, Philip II instructed the governor on how to initiate the repartimiento (forced labor) among Indios. In 1582, the Spaniards won and defended Cagayan from Sino- Japanese pirates from possible terrorism and invasion. ==Post-governorship and death== Former governor-general Francisco de Sande's chief enemy and Manila's attorney-general Captain Gabriel de Rivera filed a complaint against Ronquillo de Pe\u00f1alosa for being the captain-general of the Philippines for life. In 1583, upon processing of Rivera's complaint, Ronquillo de Pe\u00f1alosa died at his house in Manila. He was succeeded by his own nephew, Diego Ronquillo in office. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing Category:1583 deaths Category:Captains General of the Philippines ",
