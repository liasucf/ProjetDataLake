    "text": "Pok\u00e9mon Go in Syria is a photography series published in 2016 by Syrian artist Khaled Akil. Akil places Pok\u00e9mon characters in destroyed Syrian streets as a reminder for a world lost behind the screen. While Pokemon Go was trending worldwide, Akil couldn\u2019t help but notice how the media forgot about the war in Syria. So he visualised his idea in the form of digital collages. Khaled\u2019s Pokemon series quickly went viral across the globe after he posted it online. This photography series was exhibited in various locations including the American University Museum. ==References== Category:Syria articles needing attention ",
