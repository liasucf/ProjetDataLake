    "text": "Leonardo Roque Albano Gil (born 31 May 1991) is an Argentine-Chilean professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Vasco da Gama on loan from Al-Ittihad. ==Club career== ===CAI=== Born in R\u00edo Gallegos, Santa Cruz, Gil finished his formation with CAI, after representing Atl\u00e9tico Boxing Club and CSyD Ferrocarril YCF. He made his first team debut on 3 October 2009, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 1\u20130 Primera B Nacional home loss against Independiente Rivadavia. Gil became a regular starter from the 2010\u201311 campaign onwards, as his side suffered two consecutive relegations. ===Olimpo=== In July 2012, Gil moved to Olimpo in the second division, initially on a one-year loan deal. He scored his first professional goal on 7 October, netting the only goal of the match in an away defeat of Boca Unidos. An undisputed starter, he contributed with five goals in 35 matches as his side achieved promotion to Primera Divisi\u00f3n. Bought outright during the pre- season, he made his top tier debut on 4 August 2013, starting in a 2\u20131 loss at San Lorenzo. Gil scored his first goal in the main category of Argentine football on 9 May 2014, netting the opener in a 3\u20131 home win against Godoy Cruz. ===Estudiantes and loan to Talleres=== On 8 January 2015, Gil agreed to a three-year contract with fellow first division side Estudiantes, for an US$ 1 million fee for 50% of his federative rights. He made his debut for the club on 5 February, starting in a 1\u20130 Copa Libertadores away loss against Independiente del Valle. Gil never established himself as a regular starter, and was loaned to fellow league team Talleres on 19 July 2016, for one year, ===Rosario Central=== On 29 July 2017, Gil agreed to a permanent four-year contract with Rosario Central. He made his debut for the club on 26 August by starting in a 1\u20131 away draw against Col\u00f3n, and scored his first goal on 23 September by netting the opener in a 1\u20131 draw at Gimnasia La Plata. ==International career== Due to having a Chilean grandmother, Gil is eligible to represent Chile as well as Argentina. In 2015, Jorge Sampaoli wanted to nationalise Gil for Chile but he rejected in favour of pursuing chances with Argentina. Gil was called up by Argentina's under-20s in May 2011, but never represented the side. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"center\"|CAI |2009\u201310 |rowspan=\"2\"|Primera B Nacional |1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0 |- |2010\u201311 |33||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||33||0 |- |2011\u201312 |Torneo Argentino A |26||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||26||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Subtotal !60!!1!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!60!!1 |- |rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"center\"|Olimpo |2012\u201313 |Primera B Nacional |35||5||4||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||39||6 |- |2013\u201314 |rowspan=\"2\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |38||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||38||1 |- |2014\u201315 |18||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||19||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Subtotal !91!!6!!5!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!96!!7 |- |rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"center\"|Estudiantes |2015 |rowspan=\"2\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |21||1||2||0||9Appearance(s) in Copa Libertadores||0||2Appearance(s) in Liguilla Pre Libertadores||0||34||1 |- |2016 |9||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||3||0||12||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Subtotal !30!!1!!2!!0!!9!!0!!5!!0!!46!!1 |- |valign=\"center\"|Talleres (loan) |2016\u201317 |Primera Divisi\u00f3n |29||2||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||30||2 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Subtotal !29!!2!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!30!!2 |- |rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"center\"|Rosario Central |2017\u201318 |rowspan=\"3\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |22||0||2||0||1Appearance(s) in Copa Sudamericana||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||25||0 |- |2018\u201319 |19||2||5||0||4||0||1||0||29||3 |- |2019\u201320 |16||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||16||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Subtotal !57!!3!!7!!0!!5!!0!!1!!0!!70!!3 |- |valign=\"center\"|Al- Ittihad |2019\u201320 |Saudi Professional League |6||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2||0||8||1 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Subtotal !6!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!2!!0!!8!!1 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Total !273!!13!!15!!1!!14!!0!!8!!0!!310!!15 |} ==Honours== Rosario Central *Copa Argentina: 2017\u201318 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:People from R\u00edo Gallegos, Santa Cruz Category:Argentine people of Chilean descent Category:Argentine footballers Category:Argentine expatriate footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Primera B Nacional players Category:Torneo Argentino A players Category:Torneo Argentino B players Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Saudi Professional League players Category:C.A.I. footballers Category:Olimpo footballers Category:Estudiantes de La Plata footballers Category:Talleres de C\u00f3rdoba footballers Category:Rosario Central footballers Category:Ittihad FC players Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Saudi Arabia Category:Expatriate footballers in Saudi Arabia Category:Naturalized citizens of Chile ",
