Gardner was appointed as a Queen's Counsel in 1960 and was subsequently admitted to the Nigerian and British Guianan bars: he also appeared in the courts of Goa, the High Court of Singapore and the Supreme Court of India, besides having an extensive practice in England. He was a leading member of the Society of Conservative Lawyers, chairman of its executive committee from 1969 to 1975 and Chairman, 1975\u201385.

In 1987 Gardner made the first attempt to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into English law with a Private Member's Bill. Despite gathering some distinguished cross-party support (including Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone), he was unable to secure sufficient support to see his Bill into law. He was a strong advocate of Britain\u2019s membership of the common market. \u201cPulling Britain out of Europe would desolate our industries, increase our unemployment and reduce our stature in the world to insignificance\u2026.isolated from Europe we should no longer be able to influence legislation or rules which govern our trade.\u201d Gardner's major contribution to the law was the British Nationality Act 1981. Whilst in opposition in 1977, the Conservative Party asked Gardner to chair a study group to provide advice on changes to the nationality laws. The resultant Green paper, \"Who Do We Think We Are?\", was published in 1980 and its threefold definition of nationality formed the basis for the Government's legislation. ==Achievements== Called to the Bar, Gray's Inn in 1947; MP (Conservative) for Billericay 1959\u201366, for South Fylde 1970\u201383, for Fylde 1983\u201387; became a QC 1960; PPS to the Attorney General 1962\u201363; Chairman, Justice Working Party on Bail and Remands in Custody 1966; Chairman, Bar Council Committee on Parliamentary Privilege 1967; Recorder of the Crown Court 1972\u201385; Chairman, Society of Conservative Lawyers 1975\u201385; Steward, British Boxing Board of Control 1975\u201384; Knighted in 1983; Chairman, Select Committee on Home Affairs 1984\u201387. ==References== *The Times Guide to the House of Commons, Times Newspapers Ltd, 1955, 1966 & 1983 * * Full Biography * == External links == * Category:1912 births Category:2001 deaths Category:Royal Navy officers of World War II Category:Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve personnel of World War II Category:Members of Gray's Inn Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1959\u20131964 Category:UK MPs 1964\u20131966 Category:UK MPs 1970\u20131974 Category:UK MPs 1974 Category:UK MPs 1974\u20131979 Category:UK MPs 1979\u20131983 Category:UK MPs 1983\u20131987 Category:People educated at Hutton Grammar School Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Politicians awarded knighthoods ",
