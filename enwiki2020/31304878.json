Her parents, Joseph and Bessie, were Yiddish theater stars at the beginning of the 20th century, and her brothers, Hymie and Irving, not only performed but owned several prominent Yiddish theaters in New York City. When her father died, Henrietta was just seven weeks old; Bessie continued to perform and brought her four children up as performers also. Julius and Henrietta formed a team and performed together for three years. When they had an offer to perform in Belgium, Julius proposed by remarking that they could save money on visas and other expenses as a married couple.
