The district has been split off. Since 2002 it belongs mainly to Praha 3, but smaller parts belong to Praha 8 and Praha 10. The district is named after Hussite military leader Jan \u017di\u017eka. Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist Gunter Demnig. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide. Generally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self chosen residence. The name of the Stolpersteine in Czech is: Kameny zmizel\u00fdch, stones of the disappeared. == \u017di\u017ekov == {|class=\"wikitable sortable toptextcells\" style=\"width:100%\" ! class=\"unsortable\" width=\"120px\"| Stone ! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:22%;\"| Inscription !class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" data-sort- type=\"text\" style =\"width:22%;\"| Location !class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" style=\"width:100%;\"| Life and death |- | 120px | style=\"text-align:center\"| HERE LIVED DR.
