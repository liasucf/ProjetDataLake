It stars Hyun Bin, Yoo Hae-jin and Kim Joo- hyuk. ==Synopsis== Im Cheol-ryung (Hyun Bin) is an officer of a special investigation team in North Korea. His team goes to a disturbance at a warehouse that prints counterfeit money. Im Cheol-ryung's superior Cha Ki- seong (Kim Joo-hyuk) and his own team are there to steal the master plates to print the counterfeit money. A shootout takes place and, in the process, Im Cheol-ryung is shot and others killed. North Korean officials later learn that Cha Ki-seong has fled to South Korea. Im Cheol-ryung is ordered to capture Cha Ki-seong and retrieve the stolen master plates. He is given only three days to complete his mission. For the first time, South Korea and North Korea decide to cooperate to catch a criminal. South Korean officials though have doubts whether Cha Ki-seong is really a killer.
