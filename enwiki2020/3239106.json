    "text": "The Czechoslovakia national under-21 football team was the national football team for the under-21s of Czechoslovakia, before the country split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia (For information about the national teams of the two countries, see the articles Czech Republic national under-21 football team and Slovakia national under-21 football team.) Following the realignment of UEFA's youth competitions in 1976, Czechoslovakia's Under-21 team was formed. Despite the end of the country in January 1993, the team played until March 1994, fulfilling its fixtures in the UEFA U-21 Championship as a combined team.

In its twelve U-23 and U-21 competitions, the team had a decent record, winning the first competition in 1972 and reaching the quarter-finals on seven occasions.
