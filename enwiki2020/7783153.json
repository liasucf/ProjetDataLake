    "text": "\"Sou fr\u00e4i\" (English translation: \"So free\") was the Luxembourgish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1992, performed in Luxembourgish (only the second time this language was used at the Contest) by Marion Welter & Kontinent. After some thirty-five years in the Contest, Welter and Kontinent were also the fifth ever act representing Luxembourg to actually be native to the Grand Duchy. The song is an up-tempo number, with Welter explaining that she wants to be free and comparing this freedom to various things including kites and young children. The title comes from the chorus, where she sings that I want to be as free/As thoughts can be\". Welter and Kontinent also recorded the song in English and French, as \"So Free\" and \"Au vent des libert\u00e9s\" respectively. The song was performed fourteenth on the night (following Switzerland's Daisy Auvray with \"Mister Music Man\" and preceding Austria's Tony Wegas with \"Zusammen geh'n\"). At the close of voting, it had received 10 points (all from Malta), placing 21st in a field of 23. It was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1993 contest by Modern Times with \"Donne-moi une chance\". ==Sources and external links== * Official Eurovision Song Contest site, history by year, 1992 * Detailed info & lyrics, The Diggiloo Thrush, \"Sou fr\u00e4i\".
