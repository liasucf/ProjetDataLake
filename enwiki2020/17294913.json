    "text": "Ezekiel the Tragedian, also known as Ezekiel the DramatistMoses' Throne Vision in Ezekiel the Dramatist by Pieter van der Horst (1983) and Ezekiel the Poet, was a Jewish dramatist who wrote in Alexandria. Some scholars have placed his work in the 3rd century BC,Yavneh, Naomi, \"Lost and Found; Veronese's Finding of Moses\", in Gender and Early Modern Constructions of Childhood, p. 305, 2016, Eds. Naomi J. Miller, Naomi Yavneh, Routledge, , 9781351934848, google books and google books \u2013 ebook, with different pages viewable though the evidence of the date is not definitive. His only known work, Exag\u014dg\u0113, is the earliest known Jewish play. It survives only in fragments found in the writings of Eusebius, Clement of Alexandria, and Pseudo-Eustathius. Nevertheless, the extensive quotations by these writers make possible the assembly of 269 lines of text, about 20-25% of the whole.Joel Stevens Allen. The Despoliation of Egypt: In Pre-rabbinic, Rabbinic and Patristic Traditions, Brill, 2008, page 59, \"First, Ezekiel's Exag\u00f4g\u00ea, with its extant 269 lines of iambic trimeters, is the most extensive example of the Greek dramatic literature of the Hellenistic period. Second, it is the earliest Jewish play in history, and as such provides important information as how a Hellenized Jew would try to mould biblical material into Greek dramatic forms by means of techniques developed by Greek tragedians.\" The only more extensive remnant of the Greco-Jewish poets is that found in the Sibylline Oracles.John J. Collins, Between Athens and Jerusalem: Jewish Identity in the Hellenistic Diaspora, Crossroad, 1983, page 224: \"Ezekiel the Tragedian - Another early specimen of \"mystical\" Judaism is found in the drama on the Exodus by Ezekiel, which, at 269 lines, is the most extensive remnant of the Greco-Jewish poets apart from the Sibylline Oracles\" Exag\u014dg\u0113 is a five-act drama written in iambic trimeter, retelling of the biblical story of The Exodus from Egypt. Moses is the main character of the play, and parts of the biblical story have been altered to suit the narrative's needs. These changes probably point to Ezekiel's intention to stage the play, since certain scenes that are impossible to stage were converted into monologue. This drama is unique in blending the biblical story with the Hellenistic tragic drama. The main modern edition is a parallel-text English-Greek edition by classical scholar Howard Jacobson.Jacobson, Howard 1940-The Exagoge of Ezekiel, ed. Howard Jacobson, 2009: \"Professor Jacobson accompanies the text of the play with a translation. In the commentary he examines the fragments line by line, comparing them with the biblical account and other accounts in related Jewish sources.\" ==References== ==Bibliography== * J.
