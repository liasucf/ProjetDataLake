The plateau is named for the Fipa people who inhabit it. ==Geography== The plateau extends northwest-southeast, rising between two segments of the East African Rift. Lake Tanganyika (lake surface 773 m elevation) lies to the southwest in the western branch of the rift, and the graben valley of Lake Rukwa (lake surface 793 meters elevation) lies to the northeast. The plateau rises in steep escarpments above both lake valleys, and includes extensive areas above 2000 meters elevation.BirdLife International (2019) Important Bird Areas factsheet: Loazi-Kalambo Forest Reserves and surrounding area. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 02/09/2019. Mbizi (2490 m) is the highest peak, northeast of Sumbwawanga the edge of the escarpment overlooking Lake Rukwa. Malonje (2418 m) lies south of Mbizi.Watson, Graeme (1995). \"Tanzania's Other Mountains\". The Alpine Journal. Accessed 2 September 2019. Most of the plateau lies in the closed drainage basin of Lake Rukwa. The southeastern portion of the plateau is drained by the Momba River and its tributaries, and the northeastern portion is drained by tributaries of the Rungwa River; both rivers empty into Lake Rukwa. The western edge of the plateau drains into Lake Tangankyika. The Kalambo River drains the central plateau, and forms Kalambo Falls as it descends the escarpment towards Lake Tanganyika. The plateau has some wetland areas, including the Kale Swamp. Cities on the plateau include Sumbawanga, near the center of the plateau, and Namanyere in the northwest. ==Ecology== The natural vegetation on most of the plateau is miombo woodland.

Sections of the M8 are unpaved. The Tunduma-Sumbawanga Road extends southeast from Sumbawanga to Tunduma on the Zambian border, where it meets the A104 highway and the TAZARA Railway. ==References== Category:Central Zambezian miombo woodlands Category:Landforms of Tanzania Category:Southern Highlands, Tanzania Category:Southern Rift montane forest-grassland mosaic Category:Plateaus of Africa ",
