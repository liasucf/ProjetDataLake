The Mozarabic dialect has Latin origins with a combination of Arabic and Hebrew fonts.http://www.spanisharts.com/books/literature/i_lirica.htm === The epic === Many parts of Cantar de Mio Cid, Cantar de Roncesvalles, and Mocedades de Rodrigo are part of the epic. The exact portion of each of these works is disputed among scholars. The Minstrels, over the course of the 12th to the 14th centuries, were driving force of this movement. The Spanish epic likely emanated from France. There are also indications of Arabic and Visigoth. It is usually written in series of seven to eight syllables within rhyming verse.http://www.spanisharts.com/books/literature/i_epica.htm === Mester de clerec\u00eda === The cuaderna v\u00eda is the most distinctive verse written in Alexandrine verse, consisting of 12 syllables. Works during the 13th century include religious, epics, historical, advice or knowledge, and adventure themes. Examples of such themes include The Miracles of the Virgin Mary, Poema de Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, Book of Alexander, Cato\u2019s Examples, and Book of Apolonio, respectively. Some works vary and are not necessarily mester de clerec\u00eda, but are reflective of it. Such poems are of a discussion nature, such as Elena y Mar\u00eda and Reason to Love. Hagiographic poems include Life of St. Mar\u00eda Egipciaca and Book of the Three Wise Men. Mature works, like The Book of Good Love and Rhyming Book of the Palace, were not included in the genre until the 14th century.http://www.spanisharts.com/books/literature/i_clerecia.htm === Collection of verse (Cancionero) === During this movement, language use went from Galician-Portuguese to Castilian. Octosyllable, twelve syllables, and verse of arte mayor were becoming the footing of verses. Main themes derive from Proven\u00e7al poetry. This form of poetry was generally compilations of verses formed into books, also known as cancioneros. Main works include Cancionero de Baena, Cancionero de Estuniga, and Cancionero General. Other important works from this era include parts of Dance of Death, Dialogue Between Love and an Old Man, verses of Mingo Revulgo, and verses of the Baker Woman.http://www.spanisharts.com/books/literature/i_cancionero.htm === Spanish ballads === The romanceros have no set number of octosyllables, but these poems are only parallel in this form. Romancero Viejo consists of the oldest poems in these epochs, which are anonymous. The largest amount of romances comes from the 16th century, although early works were from the 14th century. Many musicians of Spain used these poems in their pieces throughout the Renaissance. Cut offs, archaic speech, and recurrent dialogue are common characteristics among these poems; however the type and focus were diverse. Lyrical romances are also a sizeable part of this era. During the 17th century, they were recycled and renewed. Some authors still stayed consistent with the original format. By the 20th century, the tradition still continued.http://www.spanisharts.com/books/literature/i_romancero.htm === Notable Spanish poets === ====Early Middle Ages==== * Mozarab Jarchas, the first expression of Spanish poetry, in Moz\u00e1rabe dialect *Mester de Juglar\u00eda ** Cantar de Mio Cid *Mester de Clerec\u00eda ** Juan Ruiz, Arcipreste de Hita ** Gonzalo de Berceo *Troubadours *Xoh\u00e1n de Cangas *Palla (troubadour) *Paio Soares de Taveir\u00f3s ====Later Middle Ages==== *Mac\u00edas *Pero Ferrus *Juan Rodr\u00edguez de la C\u00e1mara *Alfonso Mart\u00ednez de Toledo, Arcipreste de Talavera *Jorge Manrique * \u00cd\u00f1igo L\u00f3pez de Mendoza, 1st Marquess of Santillana * Juan de Mena ==Arabic and Hebrew poetry during the Moorish period== During the time when Spain was occupied by the Arabs after the early 8th century, the Iberian Peninsula was influenced by the Arabic language in both the central and southern regions. Latin still prevailed in the north.http://www.alhewar.net/Basket/Habeeb_Salloum_Spanish_Language.htm The Jewish culture had its own Golden Age through the span of the 10th to 12th centuries in Spain. Hebrew poetry was usually in the style of Piyyut; however, under Muslim rule in Spain, the style changed. These poets began to write again in what was the \u201cpure language of the Bible\u201d. Beforehand, poems were written in Midrash. This change was a result of the commitment the Arabs had to the Koran. Tempos and secular topics were now prevalent in Hebrew poetry. However, these poems were only reflections of events seen by the Jews and not of ones practiced themselves.http://medievalhebrewpoetry.org/adelmanarticle.html *The Alhambra Poets: ** Ibn al-Yayyab ** Ibn Zamrak ** Ibn al-Khatib * Ibn Sahl of Sevilla * Ibn Hazm of C\u00f3rdoba * Ibn Gabirol * Moses ibn Ezra * Abraham ibn Ezra * Ibn Quzman * Ibn Arabi ==After 1492== *Anonymous writers of the Romancero * Juan Bosc\u00e1n * Gutierre de Cetina * Alonso de Ercilla * Santa Teresa de Jes\u00fas * San Juan de la Cruz * Fernando de Herrera * Garcilaso de la Vega * Juan del Encina * Fray Luis de Le\u00f3n * Diego Hurtado de Mendoza * Lope de Rueda * Ausi\u00e0s March (in Valencian) ==The Golden Age (El Siglo de Oro)== This epoch includes the Renaissance of the 16th century and the Baroque of the 17th century.http://www.spanisharts.com/books/literature/poetrygold.htm During the Renaissance, poetry became partitioned into culteranismo and conceptismo, which essentially became rivals. :*Culteranismo used bleak language and hyperbaton. These works largely included neologisms and mythological topics. Such characteristics made this form of poetry highly complex, making comprehension difficult. :*Conceptismo was a trend using new components and resources. An example of this new extension was the Germanias. Works included comparative and complex sentences. This movement derived from Petrarchanism. During the Baroque period, Satire, Neostoicism, and Mythological themes were also prevalent. :*Satire tended to be directed to the elites, criticizing the defects of the society. This form of poetry often resulted in severe punishments being administered to the poets. :*Neostoicism became a movement of philosophical poetry. Ideas from the medieval period resurfaced. :*Mythological themes were more common in culteranismo. Not until the Generation of 1927 did these poems gain more importance. La F\u00e1bula de Polifemo y Galatea and Las Soledades are two key works.http://www.donquijote.org/spanishlanguage/literature/history/poesia.asp * Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra * Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas * Luis de G\u00f3ngora y Argote established culteranismo. * F\u00e9lix Lope de Vega Carpio * Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca * Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz ==Romanticism== Germany and England were the large forces in this movement. Over the course of the late 18th century to the late 19th century, Romanticism spread philosophy and art through Western societies of the world. The earlier part of this movement overlapped with the Age of Revolutions. The idea of the creative imagination was rising above the idea of reason. Minute elements of nature, such as bugs and pebbles, were considered divine. There were many variations of the perception of nature in these works. Instead of allegory, this era moved towards myths and symbols. The power of human emotion emerged during this period.http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/cs6/rom.html * Manuel Jos\u00e9 Quintana * Jos\u00e9 Zorrilla * Gustavo Adolfo B\u00e9cquer * Rosal\u00eda de Castro (in Galician and Spanish) * Jos\u00e9 de Espronceda ==1898 until 1926== Spain went through drastic changes after the demise of Spain\u2019s colonial empire.
