G\u00e1l came short of a gold medal for two reasons; first the fact that with various doubles partners she was unable to overcome the six times world champion pairing of M\u00e1ria Medny\u00e1nszky and Anna Sipos, and secondly the war effectively ended her chances to compete at world level. She did however continue to play in the United States. She also won two English Open titles. ==Personal life== G\u00e1l was born into a banking family was the only woman competitor on the table tennis team at the University of Szeged. She married her fellow international player Tibor H\u00e1zi in 1937 and in 1939 they fled to the United States because of their Jewish origins and they settled in Bethesda, Maryland. She died in 1990 aged 83 and H\u00e1zi died in 1999. ==See also== * List of table tennis players * List of World Table Tennis Championships medalists ==References== Category:Hungarian female table tennis players Category:1907 births Category:1990 deaths Category:Jewish table tennis players Category:American female table tennis players Category:World Table Tennis Championships medalists ",
