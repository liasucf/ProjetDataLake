    "text": "|} This is a list of electoral district results for the 1915 Queensland state election. At the time, the voting system in Queensland was based on contingency voting, which was similar to the modern optional preferential voting system. In electorates with 3 or more candidates, preferences were not distributed if a candidate received more than 50% of the primary vote. If none received more than 50%, all except the top two candidates were eliminated from the count and their preferences distributed between the two leaders, with the one receiving the most votes declared the winner. == Results by electoral district == === Albert === === Aubigny === === Balonne === === Barcoo === === Bowen === === Bremer === === Brisbane === === Bulimba === === Bundaberg === === Buranda === === Burke === === Burnett === === Burrum === === Cairns === === Carnarvon === === Charters Towers === === Chillagoe === === Cook === === Cooroora === === Cunningham === === Dalby === === Drayton === === Eacham === === East Toowoomba === === Enoggera === === Fassifern === === Fitzroy === === Flinders === === Fortitude Valley === ==== By-election ==== * This by-election was caused by the death of David Bowman and was held on 1 April 1916. === Gregory === ==== By-election ==== * This by-election was caused by the appointment of William Hamilton to the Legislative Council and was held on 4 September 1915. === Gympie === === Herbert === === Ipswich === === Ithaca === === Kennedy === === Keppel === === Kurilpa === === Leichhardt === === Lockyer === === Logan === === Mackay === === Maranoa === === Maree === === Maryborough === ==== By-election ==== * This by-election was caused by the appointment of Alfred Jones to the Legislative Council, and was held on 31 March 1917. === Merthyr === === Mirani === === Mitchell === === Mount Morgan === === Mundingburra === === Murilla === === Murrumba === === Musgrave === === Nanango === === Normanby === === Nundah === === Oxley === === Paddington === === Pittsworth === === Port Curtis === === Queenton === === Rockhampton === ==== By-elections ==== * This by-election was caused by the resignation of John Adamson.
