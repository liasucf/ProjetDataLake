Of Indian ancestry, Karim made a reputation for himself as a useful lower-order batsman but predominantly as a left-arm spinner. ==International career== Karim also holds the unique distinction of having captained his country in both representative cricket (ODIs) and tennis (Davis Cup) competition. ===Cricket=== Karim retired from international cricket following the 1999 World Cup in England but was persuaded to return to add experience to Kenya's squad for the 2003 World Cup in South Africa where he helped Kenya become the first non-Test match playing nation reach the semi-finals of the World Cup. During the Super Sixes match against Australia, Karim gave the Australians a scare with figures of 8.2-6-7-3 and collecting Man-of-the-match honours. He lost in his last ODI, the World Cup Semi Final against India. Karim announced at the end of the tournament that he would be retiring, this time for good. ===Tennis=== Karim represented Kenya in a Davis Cup tie against Egypt in 1988. He played two singles matches and one doubles rubber.Davis Cup record ==References== ==External links== * Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Cricketers at the 1996 Cricket World Cup Category:Cricketers at the 1998 Commonwealth Games Category:Cricketers at the 1999 Cricket World Cup Category:Cricketers at the 2003 Cricket World Cup Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for Kenya Category:Kenya One Day International cricketers Category:Kenyan cricket captains Category:Kenyan cricketers Category:Kenyan Muslims Category:Kenyan male tennis players Category:Kenyan people of Indian descent Category:Sportspeople from Mombasa ",
