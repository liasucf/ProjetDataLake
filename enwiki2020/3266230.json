Phoenix attended a performing arts high school and has performed in musical theatre as a singer, dancer, and actress. She practiced ballet for ten years and did tap, jazz, lyrical, and modern dance. She also taught ballet for a year. She studied classical music and was a jazz and blues singer. ==Career== ===Dancing=== Phoenix began stripping when she was 20 years old. She stripped in places outside of Toronto, such as Windsor, Ontario, to avoid being recognized by anyone who knew her. She also danced at Stringfellows in London, England. After a brief stint stripping at Tally Ho in Las Vegas, she moved to California, where she stripped at the Blue Zebra before entering the adult film industry. ===Performing=== Phoenix entered the adult film industry in March 2003 after getting in touch with World Modeling. Her first scene was in More Dirty Debutantes 253 for Ed Powers Productions. In August 2005, she became exclusively contracted to Defiance Films and their sister company, Torrid Entertainment, for one year. She ended the contract early after only six months. On April 20, 2006, she co-hosted the 22nd Annual XRCO Awards alongside Stormy Daniels. She officially retired from performing in adult films on June 6, 2006. ===Directing=== Phoenix made her directorial debut with Shut Up & Fuck Me! for Doghouse Digital in December 2004. For the sequel, Shut Up & Fuck Me 2, she only directed two out of the film's five scenes. She was also hired by Mayhem/Sin City to direct a film titled Young Bung on February 9, 2005, but she walked off the set due to creative differences and was replaced with Ariana Jollee. Later that year, she had directing contracts with No Boundaries Entertainment, Defiance Films, and Torrid Entertainment. She also directed Pussy POV for VCA Pictures. ===Mainstream media appearances=== Phoenix was hired to model tube socks, underwear, and tank tops by American Apparel. The ad featuring her was published in February 2005. ===Other ventures=== Phoenix's main goal when entering the adult film industry was to produce her own porn and build websites. In April 2005, she launched BigPimpinCash.com, a webmaster affiliate program. While in the industry, she owned the website Bang-A-Pornstar.com. She also had an official website of her own, LaurenPhoenix.com. In May 2005, Phoenix launched The Lauren Phoenix Agency to represent herself and other performers. She shut down the agency in January 2006. ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 25em; text- align: left; font-size: 90%; vertical-align: middle;\" |+ List of accolades received by Lauren Phoenix |- |- | colspan=3 | {| class=\"collapsible collapsed\" width=100% ! colspan=3 style=\"background-color: #D9E8FF; text- align: center;\" | Awards & nominations |- |- style=\"background:#d9e8ff; text- align:center;\" | style=\"text-align:center;\" | Award | style=\"text- align:center; background:#cec; text-size:0.9em; width:50px;\"| Won | style=\"text-align:center; background:#fcd; text-size:0.9em; width:50px;\"| Nominated |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"| ;AVN Awards | | |- | style=\"text- align:center;\"| ;XRCO Awards | | |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |AEBN VOD Awards | | |} |- style=\"background:#d9e8ff;\" | style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"3\"| ;Total number of wins and nominations |- | | | |} Lauren Phoenix holding her 2005 AVN Award for Female Performer of the Year... ...as well as her 2005 XRCO Award for the same category {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ AVN Awards |- !
