Unlike the previous two competitions, however, a fourth provincial team, Munster Reds took part, meaning each team had six fixtures in total. The first six fixtures took place across three matchdays, while the second six fixtures were held together in a single venue across three days, to form an Inter-Provincial T20 Festival. ===Round 1=== \\---- ===Round 2=== \\---- ===Round 3=== \\---- ===Round 4=== \\---- ===Round 5=== \\---- ===Round 6=== \\---- ==References== ==External links== * Series home at ESPN Cricinfo Inter Category:Irish domestic cricket competitions Category:Inter-Provincial Championship seasons ",
