Early that year, the track was resurfaced, and since then a new cafe and hospitality area have been added. In between the March and April MSA meeting, a new covered grandstand was built at Stadium Bend, the fastest corner on the circuit.

The new race control building was completed in late 2009. ==In popular culture== The track featured prominently in the 1964 movie 'Go Kart Go' starring Dennis Waterman and Wilfrid Brambell. == References== Category:Kart circuits Category:Motorsport venues in England Category:Sports venues in Hertfordshire Category:Hoddesdon ",
