    "text": "The GR 14 is a Percurso pedestre de grande rota (long distance footpath with standard waymarking) in Portugal, which connects with a corresponding path into Spain. In Portugal, it is known as the Rota dos Vinhos da Europa (European Wine Route), and Portuguese tourist mapsMap of the S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o da Pesqueira section, published by the municipal tourist office mark it as continuing through wine-growing areas of Spain and France to terminate at Strasbourg. As of 2015 it is not included in the list of \"E-paths\" (international routes)\"What are E-paths?\", website of the ERA-EWP-FERP published by the European Ramblers' Association; however, a long-distance route of the same number (GR 14 (Spain), known as the Senda del Duero does continue the route into Spain from the border at Salto de Saucelle\"La Senda del Duero\" on the website of the Federaci\u00f3n de Deportes de Monta\u00f1a Escalada y Senderismo de Castilla y Le\u00f3n In Portugal, the route is designated from the Atlantic coast at Vila Nova de Gaia in Oporto eastward to the Spanish border. Generally the path follows the course of the River Douro, though remaining slightly to the south of the river and at substantially greater altitudes, rising to almost 900m as against the approximately 150m of the upper Douro valley. The extent to which the path is waymarked along the whole of its length is not clear. As of 2013, only the section in the municipality of Armamar is included in the list of GR footpaths in Portugal in the National Register of Walking RoutesRNPP - Registo Nacional de Percursos Pedestres, available on the website of the Federa\u00e7\u00e3o de Campismo e Montanhismo de Portugal published by the body responsible for these, the Federa\u00e7\u00e3o de Campismo e Montanhismo de Portugal, but there is evidence that it is also waymarked at least in the municipalities of Tabua\u00e7o, S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o da Pesqueira (45 km) and Vila Nova de Foz C\u00f4a at the eastern end of the route. In those areas, the route follows well used tracks or quiet country roads, between small towns and villages where accommodation and food are readily available. River crossings on footpath sections are either by bridges (e.g. across the River T\u00e1vora), or stepping stones (e.g. across the River Torto). In accordance with the name of the route, it frequently passes through vineyards. It descends to the Douro at Ferradosa in the S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o da Pesqueira section. ==References== Category:Hiking trails in Portugal ",
