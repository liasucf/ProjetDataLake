He was one of the several new signings conducted by new Montreal head coach Zoran Jankovic. During his tenure with Montreal he mostly served as a backup goalkeeper, and appeared in two matches. On May 16, 2001 he was signed by newly expansion franchise Montreal Dynamites of the Canadian Professional Soccer League. He helped Montreal finish fourth in the overall standings, thus qualifying for the playoffs. In the playoffs the Dynamites faced St. Catharines Wolves, but were defeated by a score of 2-1. Pinto returned to the organization for the 2002 season. Montreal would finish second in the Eastern Conference and secure a postseason berth. The club was eliminated early on in a wildcard match against the Metro Lions in a 3-1 defeat. In 2004, the Dynamites took a sabbatical for the 2004 season, which resulted in Pinto re-signing with the organization for the 2005 season. The Laval franchise finished third in the Eastern Conference, and reached the quarterfinals. == References == Category:Living people Category:Canadian Professional Soccer League (1998\u20132005) players Category:Canadian soccer players Category:Laval Dynamites players Category:Montreal Impact (1992\u20132011) players Category:Soccer people from Quebec Category:USL A-League players Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Canadian people of Portuguese descent ",
