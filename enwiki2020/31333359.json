They have been the subject of biographies, novels and films. ==Confirmed mistresses== *Elizabeth or Bessie Blount, mother of his illegitimate son, Henry Fitzroy, to whom Henry VIII gave the dukedoms of Somerset and Richmond. Fitzroy, which means son of the king was acknowledged by Henry and there was talk in the 1530s that the King, who then had no male heir, would legitimise Fitzroy.Beverley Murphy, 2004, The bastard prince: Henry VIII\u2019s lost son, 172\u2013174 *Mary Boleyn, sister of Anne Boleyn, and thought to have given birth to two of Henry's children: a daughter and a son, both of whom he gave financial support, property, and titles, while also seeing to their education. Mary is often considered to be Henry's favorite mistress. *Margaret (Madge) Shelton, first cousin of Anne Boleyn. According to Imperial ambassador Eustace Chapuys, the King had an affair with 'Mistress Shelton' in February 1535, for around six months.Calendar of State Papers, Spanish, V, pt.2, p.126 In addition, Henry VIII was involved in a romantic relationship with three of his future wives before he married them. It is unclear if these relationships became sexual before marriage. He was involved with his second wife, Anne Boleyn, from around 1526, around the time he ended his relationship with her sister, Mary; Anne was also, at the time, maid-of- honour to his first wife, Catherine of Aragon. Anne was referred to by some as \"the king's whore\" or a \"naughty paike [prostitute]\".Farquhar, Michael (2001). A Treasure of Royal Scandals, p.67. Penguin Books, New York. . Henry and Anne's daughter, Elizabeth I, was born (7 September 1533) almost eight months on from their marriage (25 January 1533). From the beginning of 1536, while still married to Anne Boleyn, he was openly courting his wife's second cousin and maid-of-honour, Jane Seymour. In 1540, he began courting Catherine Howard, the maid-of-honour of his fourth spouse, Anne of Cleves. Catherine was a first cousin of Anne and Mary Boleyn. It appears that his lust for mistresses did not abate as he reached middle age. During his marriage to Catherine Parr, his sixth wife, it was speculated that he would divorce her and look for a seventh wife. ==Alleged mistresses== *Jane Popincourt, a Frenchwoman, who was a tutor to his sisters.The Mistresses of Henry VIII, Kelly Hart *Anne Bassett, stepdaughter of the King's uncle, Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle, lady-in-waiting to Jane Seymour, Anne of Cleves, Catherine Howard and Queen Mary I.The Mistresses of Henry VIII, Kelly Hart *Elizabeth Carew, wife of his close friend, Nicholas Carew, and half-first cousin of Anne Boleyn.The Mistresses of Henry VIII, Kelly Hart *Anne Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, n\u00e9e Stafford, sister of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and thus the second cousin of Henry VIII.Young Henry: The Rise of Henry VIII Robert Hutchinson ==Research== Anne Hastings.
