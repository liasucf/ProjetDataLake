The film was co- produced by Star Cinema and Viva Films under the working title Momalland. The film premiered in Philippine cinemas on December 25, 2019, as one of the official entries to the 2019 Metro Manila Film Festival. The Mall, The Merrier marks the first on-screen collaboration between Anne Curtis and Vice Ganda, both of whom are regular hosts in the noontime variety show It's Showtime. ==Synopsis== Two siblings, Moira and Morissette, feud over Tamol Mall, a mall they inherited. The feud is compounded with the arrival of their Aunt Moody, and mysterious events begin to occur when a book containing secrets of the mannequins, toys and mascots that come alive after dark is unsealed. ==Cast== ===Main cast=== * Anne Curtis as Morissette \"Setset\" Molina **Andrea Brillantes as young Morissette * Vice Ganda as Moira/Moises Molina ===Supporting cast=== * Dimples Romana as Tita Moody * Elisse Joson as Mola Molina * Jameson Blake as Tanacio Molina * Lassy Marquez as Baks * MC Calaquian as Tong * Brenda Mage as Sasha * Petite as Casim * Jin Macapagal as Ewan * Tony Labrusca as Gardo * Negi * Chad Kinis as Lovely * Matmat Centino ===Guest cast=== * Juliana Parizcovia Segovia * Zeus Collins as Lapu-Lapu * Maja Salvador as Sisa * Charo Santos-Concio as herself * Enrique Gil as Robohero * Ruffa Gutierrez as Annabelle/herself * Annabelle Rama as herself * Mark McMahon as Ferdinand Magellan *McCoy de Leon as Andres Bonifacio * Donny Pangilinan as Jose Rizal * Jackie Gonzaga *Yassi Pressman as Maria Clara * Kirst Viray as one of the Post Bastardos * Greg Hawkins * Carlo Mendoza * Miel Espinoza * Regine Velasquez as herself/singer * Ogie Diaz * Francine Diaz * Kyle Echarri * Seth Fedelin ==Development== The film was shot in Harrison Plaza in Malate, Manila, before it ceased operations on December 31, 2019. The finale scenes were filmed at Marquee Mall in Angeles City, Pampanga. ==Reception== The film received mixed reviews from critics, despite coming in first at the box office. Most of the criticism was directed at its \"non- existent\" plot, stale humor and poor use of the shopping mall setting. Oggs Cruz of Rappler lamented what he saw as a wasted opportunity, stating it is \"more of the same \u2013 and messier\" and \"while the settings change or the genre it spoofs shift, the elements remain the same. The comedies are all anchored on mean-spirited hilarity, all utilizing a broad moral lesson to make its abject crassness palatable to the families it caters to,\" comparing it unfavorably to George Romero's seminal zombie film Dawn of the Dead whose department store setting was used to satirize consumerism. Conversely, Jocelyn Valle of PEP.ph gave the film a more positive review, praising the cast, special effects and pop culture references, particularly the feud between the Baretto sisters and the network rivalry between ABS-CBN and GMA Network, a scene of which where Vice's character Moises and a parodic depiction of the living doll Annabelle from The Conjuring, played by Ruffa Gutierrez, get into a hair-pulling fight and wind up in the premises of the GMA-7 broadcast facility. Valle did, however, criticise the \"lack of a strong supporting character for Vice to throw punchlines at and comedic flair\" and found Vice's use of a joke pertaining to German dictator Adolf Hitler to be of poor taste in light of Holocaust victims. ==Television release== The film premiered on KBO from May 1\u20136, 2020 at the time ABS-CBN Channel 2 and its broadcast stations went off air on May 5, 2020, due to the \"cease and desist order\" given by the National Telecommunications Commission due to expired franchise, and KBO was not affected in this \"cease and desist order\" (due to the channel is on a digital station that is owned by AMCARA, which has its own franchise and where ABS-CBN had a blocktime agreement with the said station) until June 30, 2020 in Metro Manila and July 1, 2020 nationwide. The film premiered on Cinema One on August 2, 2020. and premiered on PBO on October 10, 2020. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 films Category:2019 comedy horror films Category:Philippine comedy horror films Category:2010s parody films Category:Cultural depictions of Ferdinand Magellan Category:Cultural depictions of Filipino men Category:Films about dolls Category:Films about toys Category:Films set in department stores Category:Philippine films Category:Philippine parody films Category:Philippine ghost films Category:Sentient toys in fiction Category:Supernatural comedy films Category:Philippine urban fantasy films ",
