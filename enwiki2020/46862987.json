Kohavi, an Israeli Special Forces officer, began working on drinking water solution in 2008 after observing the logistics challenges Israeli forces had during the Israeli-Lebanon conflict two years earlier. After several days, most of the convoys were shot up, so the soldier on the front line was out of water. The idea was to provide independency for the troops on the field with an embedded 120-pound system on the vehicle that extracts water from ambient air and is capable of creating 12.6 gallons in 24 hours at 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 55 percent humidity. On June 2009 Kohavi founded Watergen (now \"Watergen\") a company that design solutions for supplying water.
