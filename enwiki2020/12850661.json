    "text": "Interstate 69 (I-69) is a proposed Interstate Highway that will pass through the northwestern part of the U.S. state of Louisiana. ==Route description== In Louisiana, I-69 will pass near Shongaloo, Haynesville, and Minden in north Louisiana. It will then turn southwest, intersecting I-20 near Haughton in Bossier Parish and then head south of Shreveport, skirting along the eastern and southern edges of Barksdale Air Force Base. I-69 will then turn more westerly, intersect I-49 near Stonewall in DeSoto Parish, north of Mansfield and head for the Texas state line. Among officials working for this route was Mayor Dennis Freeman of Logansport in DeSoto Parish, who served from 1984 until his death in 2007. ==Sections== I-69 has been divided into a number of sections of independent utility (SIUs). ===SIU 14=== From I-20 near Haughton, Louisiana, I-69 will probably be built on a new alignment towards Haynesville. From Haynesville, the freeway will enter Arkansas and run northeast to U.S. Route 82 (US 82) west of El Dorado. ===SIU 15=== SIU 15 continues around the south and east sides of the Shreveport area, crossing I-49 and ending at I-20 near Haughton. The project would provide a divided, four-lane, limited-access highway on new location between US 171 near the Town of Stonewall in DeSoto Parish, and I-20 near the Town of Haughton in Bossier Parish, a distance of approximately . The project Study Area encompasses portions of Bossier, Caddo, and DeSoto parishes. ===SIU 16=== As well as covering the part in Texas northeast of Nacogdoches, SIU 16 also extends into Louisiana, ending at US 171 near Stonewall. Texas is leading the environmental studies on Segment 16, with support from Louisiana for the portion within that state. Originally envisioned to be incorporated into the Trans-Texas Corridors (TTC), the Tier I Environmental Impact Statement was approved and a Record of Decision was issued in 2010 favoring the \"No-Build\" option that abandoned the Trans-Texas Corridor concept in lieu of upgrading existing US and state routes in the corridor. As a result of the Tier I \"No-Build\" Record of Decision issued for the TTC concept, a new environmental study will be required for Segment 16, which has not been started. ==See also== * ==References== ==External links== * Louisiana 69 69 ",
