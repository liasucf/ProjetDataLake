    "text": "Play It Again, Charlie Brown is the seventh prime-time animated TV special based upon the comic strip Peanuts, by Charles M. Schulz. It originally aired on CBS on March 28, 1971. This was the first Peanuts TV special of the 1970s, and the first special to focus on a character other than Charlie Brown or Snoopy. It also marked the first time someone other than Peter Robbins voiced Charlie Brown, which in this case was Chris Inglis as the character, since Robbins' voice changed after the previous special. Also, all the other remaining original actors from the first special, except for Bill Melendez, also were replaced by someone else, leaving Bill Melendez the only original actor remaining until his death on September 2, 2008. However, recordings of his voice were used in later Peanuts animated media. ==Plot== This special centers on Lucy's infatuation with Schroeder and her willingness to do anything to win his affections. Frustrated in her perpetual failures, she opens up to Sally and Peppermint Patty about her situation, and Peppermint Patty comes up with an idea: invite him to play his piano at an upcoming PTA concert. Lucy goes along with the idea and goes back to tell Schroeder, who warms up to the idea, and after thanking Lucy begins rehearsing right away. Schroeder's thanking her for the invitation is enough to send Lucy skyrocketing onto cloud nine; she again runs into Peppermint Patty and thanks her for the idea, but then Peppermint Patty adds something she forgot to mention before: the PTA wants a rock concert, not a classical recital. Lucy anguishes over this revelation, knowing that Schroeder will never agree to it, so she asks Charlie Brown, Snoopy and Pig-Pen for help. Snoopy brings out a set of drums, an acoustic guitar and an upright bass, and as the three start playing with Lucy dancing, Schroeder walks by. Lucy introduces the combo as his backup band for the PTA concert. Schroeder, still thinking he will be doing a recital, insists he can handle it alone, but when Lucy tells him that the PTA wants a rock concert instead, Schroeder backs out. After coercing from Charlie Brown, Schroeder reluctantly changes his mind, but soon regrets selling out his beloved Beethoven. The combo is tuning up their instruments in preparation for the PTA concert. Schroeder arrives close to show time, but despite Lucy and Peppermint Patty's pleading, he decides to stick to his guns and refuses to play rock music. Later, Lucy visits Schroeder again and somehow offends him when she comments about Beethoven not making it in Nashville. Schroeder is insulted and leaves, and Lucy, after quipping that Beethoven \"probably wouldn't have made it in New Orleans either\", then takes out her transistor radio and happily listens to rock and roll on Schroeder's piano during the closing credits. ==Voice cast== *Danny Hjeim as Schroeder *Pamelyn Ferdin as Lucy van Pelt *Stephen Shea as Linus van Pelt *Lynda Mendelson as Frieda *Hilary Momberger as Sally Brown *Chris Inglis as Charlie Brown/Pig-Pen *Christopher DeFaria as Peppermint Patty *Bill Melendez as Snoopy *Unnamed female voice as PTA meetings spray cans ==Music score== The majority of music cues for ' consist of works composed by Ludwig van Beethoven.
