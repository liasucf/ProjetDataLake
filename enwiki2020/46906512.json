Retrieved 6 June 2015. == AI Drug Discovery Technology == SOMAI PRO Technology is a proprietary AI-based drug discovery technology of SOM Biotech. It is based on Artificial Intelligence and operates by the identification of Molecular field maps. The company successfully applies SOMAI PRO technology to identify drugs effective for any therapeutic area of interest by the identification of new unknown targets of drugs, as well as to identify new indications for the drug. The main strength of AI technology is that it identifies the mechanisms of action (biological activity) of molecules and determines its non-structural analogs with similar biological activity. This is a key differentiating factor in relation to most of other AI-based approaches, which use methods based on data mining, structural similarity, or the target structure. The technology allows to reduce costs and time for drug development, providing a high level of success and reliable patent protection. SOMAI PRO is suited to be applied for any therapeutic area and for new chemical entities. == Products == SOM Biotech has an extensive portfolio of products that is focused mainly on neurology and also in other therapeutic areas.
