It was her first album of new material since 2001's Life on a String. The record was produced by Anderson, Lou Reed and Roma Baran. Anderson began touring the project in late 2007. The album was originally slated for release in 2008. Because the project kept changing in form, the release was pushed back several times. The final release in 2010 was a two-disc set consisting of a CD of music and a DVD. The song \"Only an Expert\" was released as a 12\" vinyl single on May 18, 2010.
