He was previously the editor of CityArts (2011\u20132014), the lead film critic for the alternative weekly New York Press (1997\u20132011), and the arts editor and critic for The City Sun (1984\u20131996). Other publications that have carried his work include Film Comment, Variety, The Nation, The New York Times, Slate, Columbia Journalism Review, and First Things. White is known for his provocative, idiosyncratic and often contrarian reviews, which have made him a controversial figure in film criticism. These include negative reviews of widely acclaimed movies such as The Dark Knight, There Will Be Blood, Up, Toy Story 3, and Get Out. On the other hand, he has championed critically disliked films such as G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, Jonah Hex, Grown Ups, and I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry, the latter of which he indicated as being a better gay-themed film than Brokeback Mountain. His work led film critic Roger Ebert in 2009 to label White as a \"smart and knowing [...] troll\". ==Early life== White was raised in northwest Detroit, Michigan, as the youngest of seven children. His family was the first African-American family to move to a primarily Jewish neighborhood, where he grew up. Raised Baptist, he later became Pentecostal, and identifies himself as \"a believer\". His interest in journalism and film criticism began as a student at Detroit's Central High School, when he first read the book Kiss Kiss Bang Bang by film critic Pauline Kael, whom he cites for \"her willingness to go against the hype\", along with Andrew Sarris, for his \"sophisticated love of cinema\",Staff (2004). \"The Critic\".
