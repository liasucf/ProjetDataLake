    "text": "Washington at Verplanck's Point, by John Trumbull (1790) Verplanck's Point lies at the southernmost end of the hamlet of Verplanck in the town of Cortlandt, New York in the upper northwest corner of Westchester County. Both derive their name from the activities of the Verplanck family, established in New Amsterdam by Abraham Isaacsen Verplanck in the 1630s. ==History== Verplanck's Point is best known for its role in the American Revolutionary War, several times serving as an encampment for George Washington's Continental Army during its crossings of the Hudson River. Its flat alluvial plane served as a natural staging area for ferrying men and materiel from Kings Ferry, lying between the Point and the neighboring hamlet of Montrose and Stony Point on the west bank of the river. Pursued by the army of British General William Howe, Washington was en route to Fort Lee, New Jersey.Chernow, 2010, p. 257 From there it continued south to Yorktown, Virginia, where Washington received the surrender of General Cornwallis on October 19, 1781. ===Troop Review=== A year later, in September 1782, Verplanck's Point, an alluvial plain and natural place for an encampment during the inherent bottleneck of an arduous and slow ferrying of men and materiel across the river, again became the site of the Continental Army's bivouac upon crossing the Hudson. On the 14th Washington staged a review of Continental Army there as an honor for the departing French commander in chief Comte de Rochambeau and his army. Washington wrote of the display: > \"As the intention of drawing out the troops tomorrow is to compliment his > Excellency the Count de Rochambeau; The troops as he passes them shall pay > him the honors due the commander in chief,\" adding with typical attention to > detail, \"On this occasion the tallest men are to be in the front rank.\"The > Writings of George Washington from the Original Manuscript Sources, John C. > Fitzpatrick, p. 157 ==Trumbull painting== John Trumbull painted a full-length oil portrait of Washington at Verplanck's Point, and gifted it to Martha Washington. Based on its success he produced a much larger work scaled up to nearly four times its size for the City of New York, George Washington, substituting Evacuation Day of New York City in 1783 as its backdrop for departing French commander-in- chief General Rochambeau's review of Washington's Continental Army troops on September 14, 1782. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Populated places on the Hudson River Category:George Washington Category:American Revolution ",
