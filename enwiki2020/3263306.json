The club is affiliated to the Football Association of Wales (FAW), West Wales Football Association (WWFA), Welsh Football League and the Swansea Senior Football League. ==History== Garden Village A.F.C. was founded in 1922 and started playing football at Swansea League level before joining the Carmarthenshire League midway through the 20th century. After numerous league and cup successes over the years, Village gained promotion into the Welsh Football League at the end of the 1998\u201399 season after finishing second in the Premier Division of the Carmarthenshire League, and successfully beating Neath League team Cwmamman United in the Welsh League promotion play-off. In their first season of Welsh League football, the club secured promotion by finishing third in Welsh League Division Three. In the Welsh Cup Village defeated Pontyclun and Ely Rangers before being knocked out by Inter Cardiff. In the 2000\u201301 season, Village finished eighth in their first season. The following season Village became Division Two Champions and were promoted to Welsh League Division One. In the 2002\u201303 season Village were finished 16th and were relegated. After a number of seasons in Division Two the club regained Division One status when they finished third in season 2008/09. In 2010\u201311 Village were relegated back into Division Two. Season 2013\u201314 saw Garden Village return to the first Division after finishing third in the league, Season 2015\u201316 saw the management team and a number of players leave the club and Village were relegated to Division Two. ==Stadium== Garden Village play at the Stafford Common ground. In 2006 the club opened its new changing room facilities while a new bar and suite area was added to the current club house in the summer of 2008. In 2009 a 75 seater stand was installed as well as the rebuilding of the covered standing area that had been damaged previously by a storm. During the summer of 2010 the floodlights system was completed. In the summer of 2012, the main pitch was ripped up completely to install the new drainage system. Over the years, the main pitch has had many problems with the drainage, so the decision was made to upgrade the drainage facility to help solve the problem. The work was finally completed at the end of September 2012. The summer of 2014 saw further development of the ground with a wooden perimeter fence being erected to fully enclose the main pitch area. ==Club honours== *West Wales Senior Cup : Runners-up (2006/07) *Welsh League Division 2 : Champions (2001/02), *Welsh League Reserve Cup : Runners-up (2001/02) *Welsh League Reserve Division West : Winners (2007/08) *Welsh League Reserve Division West : Runners-up (2005/06) *Carmarthenshire League Premier Division : Runners-up (1989/90), (1997/98), (1998/99) *Carmarthenshire League Division 1 : Champions (1988/89) / Runners- up (1977/78) *Carmarthenshire League Division 2 : Champions (2001/02), (2004/05) *Carmarthenshire League Division 3 : Runners-up (1999/00) *Carmarthenshire League Reserve Division 1 : Champions (2005/06) *Carmarthenshire League Reserve Division 2 : Champions (1990/91), (1998/99) *Carmarthenshire League Reserve Division 3 : Champions (1989/90), (1996/97) *Carmarthenshire League Senior Cup : Winners (1989/90), (1994/95), (1995/96), (1996/97) / Runners-up (1990/91), (1992/93) *Carmarthenshire League TG Davies Premier Cup : Runners-up (1998/99) *Carmarthenshire League Challenge Cup : Winners (1988/89) *Carmarthenshire League Darch Reserve Cup : Winners (1993/94), (1999/00), (2000/01) / Runners-up (1981/82), (1990/91), (1991/92), (1996/97), (1997/98), (2008/09) *Krisyln Summer Cup : Winners (1978/79), (1990/91), (1992/93), (1994/95), (1997/98), (1998/99), (1999/00) / Runners-up (1979/80), (1989/90), (1991/92), (2010/11), (2013/14), (2014/15) *Swansea League Investiture Cup : Runners-up (1968/69) *Swansea League Gwalia Cup : Runners-up (1938/39) *West Wales Youth Cup : Winners (2003/04) *West Wales Youth League Cup : Winners (2014/15) *West Wales Youth League Division A : Winners (2016/17) *West Wales Youth League Division B : Winners (2014/15) *West Wales Youth League Championship Playoffs : Winners (2014/15), Winners (2016/17) ==Current players== ===Welsh League Second Division (1st Team)=== ===Welsh League Reserve Division West (2nd Team)=== ===Swansea League Third Division (3rd Team)=== ===Welsh League Youth Division (U19s)=== ===West Wales Youth League Division B (U18s)=== ==Backroom staff== ===Club Officials=== * Chairman: Robert Lloyd * Football vice-chairman: Alan Rushby * Football Secretary: Nick Elias * Asst Football Secretary: Clive Greenfield * Vice- Chairman: Phil James * general secretary: Clive Williams * Treasurer: Brian Matthews * Head Groundsman: Eddie Donne ===Club Management=== * 1st Team Manager: David D'Auria * 1st Team Assistant Manager: Ashley Richards * 1st Team Coach: Kevin Murphy * 1st Team Player/Coach: Dayle Selvage * 2nd Team Manager: Kevin Lewis * 2nd Team Assistant Manager: Nicky Romanello * 2nd Team Coach: John Ireland * 3rd Team Manager:Nigel Lewis * 3rd Team Asstistant Manager:Owen Williams * Under 19s Manager: John Ireland * Under 19s Assistant Manager: Shaun Cartwright * Under 19s Coach: Dean Lewis * Under 18s Manager: Stuart Davies * Under 18s Assistant Manager: Phil Llewellyn * Under 18s Coach: Vacant ==Teams== The club run 5 senior teams in: *Welsh League Division Two (First Team) *Welsh League Reserve Division West (Second Team) *Swansea Senior League Division Three (Third Team) *Welsh League Youth Division West (U19s) *West Wales Youth League Division B (U18s) The club also run a number of Junior sides, including: *Under-6s & Under-7s (Friendly Mini Football) *Under-8s to Under-11s (Swansea Junior League Mini Football) *Under-12s to Under-14s (Swansea Junior League) *Under-15s & Under-16s (Carmarthenshire Junior Football League) *Under-12 Girls (West Wales Women & Girls League) *Under-14 Girls (West Wales Women & Girls League) ==External links== * Map of Stafford Common, home of Garden Village Football Club * Garden Village AFC Official Website * Football Association of Wales * Welsh Football League * West Wales FA * Swansea Senior Football League * West Wales Youth League == References == Category:Football clubs in Swansea Category:Association football clubs established in 1922 Category:1922 establishments in Wales Category:Welsh Football League clubs Category:Swansea Senior League clubs Category:Ardal Leagues clubs ",
