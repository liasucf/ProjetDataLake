In 1977, an additional seven Hmong families from Bo Leo mountain in the Mueng Nan District of Luang Prabang Province came to the village. The Hmong population gradually increased due to the relationships between families, kin and friends with Hmong families from other villages in and outside the province. Although they lived in the same village, Khmu and Hmong families lived in separate residential clusters. By 1995, due to population growth, Long Lao village had divided into two smaller villages. The Khmu cluster became Long Lau Kau village, while the H'mong cluster became Long Lau May village. This division was mainly done in terms of administrative and demographic structure. However, village boundaries, cultivated land, livestock and forest resources had not been divided. Accordingly, people of one village could go into the other for cultivation, collecting forest products for daily life as well as worshiping the Nature Spirit.Veerle, Vandenhende (2014). \"Nature spirit - An Approach to Biological Human Ecology Theory\" ==Geography== Long Lau May village is located in the southwest of Luang Prabang, 18 km from the Luang Prabang World Heritage UNESCO City.
