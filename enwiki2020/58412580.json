The tournament was the 40th year the league has conducted a postseason tournament. The tournament was held March 4, 7, and 10, 2019 at campus sites of the higher seeds. Liberty upset top-seeded Lipscomb 74\u201368 in the championship game to win the tournament, and the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. ==Seeds== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"white-space:nowrap; font-size:95%;text- align:center\" !Seed !School !Conference !Tiebreaker |- |1 |align=left|Lipscomb |14\u20132 |align=left|NET Rating 47 |- |2 |align=left|Liberty |14\u20132 |align=left|NET Rating 63 |- |3 |align=left|North Florida |9\u20137 |align=left|1\u20131 vs. FGCU, 1\u20133 vs. Lipscomb/Liberty, 1\u20131 vs. NJIT, 2\u20130 vs. UNA |- |4 |align=left| |9\u20137 |align=left|1\u20131 vs. UNF, 1\u20133 vs. Lipscomb/Liberty, 1\u20131 vs. NJIT, 1\u20131 vs. UNA |- |5 |align=left|NJIT |8\u20138 |align=left| |- |6 |align=left|North Alabama |7\u20139 |align=left| |- |7 |align=left|Jacksonville |5\u201311 |align=left| |- |8 |align=left|Kennesaw State |3\u201313 |align=left|1\u20131 vs. Stetson, 0\u20134 vs. Lipscomb/Liberty, 1\u20133 vs. UNF/FGCU, 1\u20131 vs. NJIT |- bgcolor=#bbbbbb |DNQ |align=left|Stetson |3\u201313 |align=left|1\u20131 vs. Kennesaw State, 0\u20133 vs. Lipscomb/Liberty, 1\u20133 vs. UNF/FGCU, 0\u20132 vs. NJIT |} Because North Alabama is in the first year of a four-year transition from NCAA Division II to Division I, it will not be eligible to compete in either the NCAA Tournament or the NCAA-operated NIT.
