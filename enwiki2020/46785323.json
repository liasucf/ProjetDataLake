ST Engineering announced that the group\u2019s marine arm, ST Marine would be the lead system integrator and build the eight vessels at its Singapore Benoi Yard while the group\u2019s electronics arm, ST Electronics, would supply the core combat systems and combat system integration solutions. The first vessel was planned for delivery in 2016 and all eight vessels will be fully operational by 2020. The keel for the first vessel was laid at ST Marine's Benoi Yard on 11 September 2014, officiated by Permanent Secretary (Defence) Chan Yeng Kit. A naming contest was held by MINDEF from 12 February 2015, and the winning names were announced by the Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen on 15 May 2015. ==Design== The Littoral Mission Vessel (LMV) was jointly designed by Saab Kockums AB and ST Marine with Singapore's Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) as the overall manager and systems integrator and was derived from Saab Kockum's FLEXpatrol multi-mission patrol vessel. The design of the LMV was guided by two specific requirements. Due to declining birth rates, manpower had been a critical concern for the Singapore Armed Forces and the design reflects attempts to increase the efficiency of a reduced manning crew from 30 to 23. This was achieved through increased levels of automation and remote monitoring. Another key feature is the Integrated Command Centre which combines the ship's bridge, combat information centre (CIC), and machinery control spaces. The other requirement reflected in the design of the LMV is the need to handle multiple roles, from low intensity conflicts to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) operations. The requirement is met through the ability to dynamically reconfigure the LMV through containerised mission packages. The LMV is also equipped with a unique, twin stern slipways from PALFinger Marine for the launch and recovery of RHIBs. ==Ships in class== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Ship !Pennant number !Builder !Laid down !Launched !Commissioned !Status |- |RSS Independence |15 |rowspan=8|ST Marine |11 September 2014 |3 July 2015 |5 May 2017 |Active, in service |- |RSS Sovereignty |16 |14 May 2015 |16 April 2016 |14 November 2017 |Active, in service |- |RSS Unity |17 |26 November 2015 |13 October 2016 |14 November 2017 |Active, in service |- |RSS Justice |18 |26 May 2016 |18 March 2017 |26 September 2018 |Active, in service |- |RSS Indomitable |19 |11 November 2016 |23 September 2017 |26 September 2018 |Active, in service |- |RSS Fortitude |20 |26 May 2017 |24 March 2018 |31 January 2020 |Active, in service |- |RSS Dauntless |21 |20 October 2017 |18 August 2018 |31 January 2020 |Active, in service |- |RSS Fearless |22 |April 2018 |26 January 2019 |31 January 2020 |Active, in service |} ==See also== * Littoral combat ship ==References== ===Citations=== ==External links== * Singapore launches seventh Littoral Mission Vessel \u2014 Jane\u2019s Navy International, August 20, 2018 Category:Patrol vessels Category:Stealth ships Category:Ships of the Republic of Singapore Navy Category:Republic of Singapore Navy ",
