    "text": "The Privy Committee (; also referred to as the Unofficial Committee) was an unofficial consultative body during the reign of Alexander I in Russia. The Private Committee was operational from June 1801 until late 1803. It comprised the closest associates of the tsar (the so-called \"young friends\"), including Count Pavel Stroganov, Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, Counts Viktor Kochubey and Nikolay Novosiltsev. Mikhail Speransky took an active part in the Committee, although he wasn't a formal member. The Private Committee was a place for discussing many governmental undertakings, such as the Senate reform, establishment of ministries in 1802, and others. The committee paid much attention to the peasant issues and prepared a few edicts with regards to this, such as decrees on allowing merchants and petty bourgeois (\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0430\u043d\u0435, or meshchane) to acquire land (1801), on free bread ploughmen (\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0445\u043b\u0435\u0431\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0448\u0446\u044b, or volniye khlebopashtsy) (1803), and others. == Further reading == * ==See also== * Government reform of Alexander I Category:Politics of the Russian Empire ",
