    "text": "Mom\u010dilo Tapavica (; ; 14 October 1872 - 10 January 1949) was an all-around sportsperson, competing in tennis, weightlifting, wrestling. Tapavica achieved his best result in tennis by winning the singles bronze medal at the 1896 Summer Olympics, making him the first ethnic Serb, Slav and Hungarian citizen to win an Olympic medal. After his sporting career Tapavica became a well- known architect. ==Sports career== Tapavica, an ethnic Serb, was born in N\u00e1dalja, Kingdom of Hungary (now Nadalj, Serbia) in 1872. He began to practise sports in \u00dajvid\u00e9k (Novi Sad), continuing his training in Budapest, where he studied architecture and civil engineering at the Technical College. His performances excelled and he was selected in the Hungarian team for the first Olympic Games in Athens in 1896, where he competed in tennis, weightlifting and wrestling. At the 1896 Summer Olympics, Tapavica, being the lone tennis player in Hungary's Olympic Team, won the bronze medal in the singles tennis tournament. In the first round, he defeated D. Frangopoulos of Greece. The second round gave him a bye, subsequently Dionysios Kasdaglis of Egypt beat Tapavica in the semifinal, and with no playoff for third place he shared bronze medal honors with Greek Konstantinos Paspatis. Tapavica was the first ethnic Serb to win an Olympic medal, as well as the first \u2013 and to date the only \u2013 Hungarian to win a medal in tennis at the Olympic Games. He did not compete in the doubles tournament. In weightlifting, Tapavica overextended himself, which caused him a shoulder injury and eventually finished last of the six competitors in the two-handed weightlifting, now known as the clean and jerk. Two days later, still unhealed, Tapavica was defeated in the first round of the wrestling competition by Stephanos Christopoulos. The two were nearly evenly matched, but Tapavica tired first and conceded. After the Olympic Games, Tapavica never again participated in competitive events, however he continued to do recreational sports, such as athletics, gymnastics and rowing. For many years he was a member of the \u00dajvid\u00e9k-based rowing club Danubius. ==Architecture achievements== Matica srpska building in Novi Sad After his graduation, Tapavica remained in Budapest for a shorter period before returning to \u00dajvid\u00e9k. In 1908, for the invitation of Nicholas I of Montenegro, Tapavica went to Montenegro, where he designed several buildings. Among his notable works from this period are the German Embassy and National Bank in Cetinje, and the building of Boka Hotel in Herceg Novi, which was destroyed by an earthquake in 1979. The building of the Matica srpska in Novi Sad, erected by the plans of Tapavica, was finished in 1912. Upon the outbreak of World War I, Tapavica first emigrated to Austria-Hungary, and later through Rome and Lausanne he ended up in Morocco. While in Morocco, he joined the French Foreign Legion and became friends with Spain's future dictator Francisco Franco. After the war he returned to Novi Sad, where he ran his own architectural design company and actively participated in discussions about the urban planning of the city. Following World War II, in 1948, he moved to Pore\u010d, where he significantly contributed to the rebuilding of the war-torn city. He died in 1949 in Pula. ==Legacy== Monument dedicated to Mom\u010dilo Tapavica in Novi Sad His life is the subject of a 2016 documentary Tapavica directed by Milan Todorovi\u0107.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5634852/ A bust is bestowed in his honor in Novi Sad. ==See also== * List of Serbian architects ==References== ==External links== * Tapavica - documentary movie Category:1872 births Category:1949 deaths Category:People from Srbobran Category:Serbs of Vojvodina Category:Tennis players at the 1896 Summer Olympics Category:19th- century male tennis players Category:Weightlifters at the 1896 Summer Olympics Category:19th-century sportsmen Category:Wrestlers at the 1896 Summer Olympics Category:Hungarian male sport wrestlers Category:Hungarian male tennis players Category:Serbian male tennis players Category:Hungarian male weightlifters Category:Serbian male weightlifters Category:Serbian male sport wrestlers Category:Olympic tennis players of Hungary Category:Olympic weightlifters of Hungary Category:Olympic wrestlers of Hungary Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Hungary Category:Olympic medalists in tennis Category:People associated with physical culture Category:Hungarian architects Category:Serbian architects Category:Medalists at the 1896 Summer Olympics Category:Soldiers of the French Foreign Legion ",
