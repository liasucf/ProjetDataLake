Those men were D.R. Edwards, C.Harris, G. Brinn, C.E. Rolfe, D.Curitz, G.T. Addis, T.J.E. Price, H. Thomas, H.E. Gosling and T.Curitz. Initially, the charity funded a range of local projects in the health and social fields. In 1964, Tenovus Cancer Care embarked on a project that was to influence their work over the next 40 years. D.R. Edwards, the founder Chairman of the group of ten, cut the first sod on the site of the Tenovus Institute for Cancer Research in Cardiff. Since then, Tenovus Cancer Care has concentrated its efforts on cancer, and Tenovus Cancer Care scientists have been recognised for their pioneering work.'who we are' at tenovuscancercare.org.uk Accessed 16 January 2018Tenovus Cancer Care new regional office, at davidhanson.org.uk Accessed 18 January 2018 Tenovus Cancer Care remains the biggest Wales-based funder of cancer research and has developed a range of services to support cancer patients directly, including a free Support Line, benefits advice, two Mobile Cancer Support Units and 'Sing with Us' choirs across the country.

During this period, over 10,000 treatments have been provided.

Initial research conducted by Cardiff University and Tenovus Cancer Care has proved that singing in the choirs reduces anxiety and pain, as well as helping to improve physical function. Tenovus Cancer Care's work in this area also featured in the October 2012 Channel 4 documentary 'Sing For Your Life', where the charity set up a choir of cancer patients that performed at the Royal Albert Hall.'how we can help you/sing with us/' at tenovuscancercare.org.uk Accessed 16 January 2018'Give hope.

In 2015 Tenovus Cancer Care conducted research with the Royal College of Music in London into the benefits of singing. By taking saliva samples from around 200 choir members before, and after rehearsal, they showed singing in one of their choirs was effective at reducing peoples' anxiety and depression, and had a positive impact on biological markers related to stress, immune function and inflammatory response. This research is now being expanded on with a two-year study with the Royal College of Music and the Royal Marsden Hospital.'research/more than singing/' at tenovuscancercare.org.uk Accessed 16 January 2018 == See also == * Cancer in the United Kingdom ==References== ==External links== *Tenovus Cancer Care Official website Category:Health charities in the United Kingdom Category:Cancer organisations based in the United Kingdom ",
