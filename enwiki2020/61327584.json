They were originally from the Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Kottayam. They got organized in the 1980s as Knanaya Catholic Association. In January 1981, they sought the help of the then bishop of Kottayam, Mar Kuriakose Kunnacherry to send Knanaya Catholic priests to Chicago to serve their pastoral needs in the Syro-Malabar rite. Since the Bishop of Kottayam has no ecclesiastical jurisdiction in the United States, he encouraged the association to contact the Archbishop of Chicago, to start Knanaya Missions under the Latin diocese and served by a priest sent from the Diocese of Kottayam. In the meantime, the Knanaya Catholic association used to arrange Syro-Malabar Holy Mass on alternate Saturday evenings whenever a priest was available. The Archbishop of Chicago appointed Fr. Jacob Chollampel who came from the Diocese of Kottayam to serve the pastoral needs of the Syro- Malabar faithful in Chicago with effect from 28 October 1983.https://shkcparish.us/1981-2001.html He was living in the rectory of St. Ita church.
