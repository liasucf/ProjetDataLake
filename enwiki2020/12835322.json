Morton believed that contemporary artists are by nature interdisciplinary, and that the former structure of discrete 'majors' in painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture, jewellery and glass making was not suited to a contemporary art school. In the new course, students in the Fine Art program would be taught by practicing artists in open studios focused on contemporary practice, rather than those committed to single disciplines such as sculpture, painting, drawing or photography.
