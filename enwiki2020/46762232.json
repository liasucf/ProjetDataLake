The countryside between the wayside stations of Leinem\u00fchle and Gartenhaus, a road toll known as chausseegeld was collected in former times, consists of mixed woods, farmland and pastures in the Schwennecke valley. == History == Pansfelde was first mentioned in 1276 under the name of Pamesvelde.

The ancestors of the present 570 or so population worked at the castle, defended it, worked as farm hands or foresters or in the mills and helped during the hunts. On 1 January 2002 Pansfelde joined the town of Ermsleben and five other villages to form the new town of Falkenstein/Harz.StBA: Changes to the municipalities of Germany, see 2002 == Sights == Built from rubble stone, the church of St. John and the vicarage, one of the few surviving timber-framed houses in the village, are listed buildings.
