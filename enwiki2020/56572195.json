    "text": "Kelly Lynn Davis is an award-winning journalist and investigative reporter from San Diego, California. == Career == Davis helped launch San Diego CityBeat in 2002 with David Rolland and was one of the main editors. In March 2015, Davis left Southland Publishing, Inc, the publisher of San Diego CityBeat. After leaving CityBeat, Davis became a freelance writer. In May 2020, Davis joined The Appeal as a senior editor. Davis has covered California laws about sex offenders, and has investigated San Diego's homeless situation. === Inmate deaths === Davis and Dave Maass released a 5-part investigative series starting in 2013 in San Diego CityBeat about inmates dying in San Diego jails at the highest rates in the state, many of which were preventable deaths. This series won investigative awards and resulted in new policies and training to reduce suicides. In 2014, after the series had received widespread media attention, an inmate hanged himself while imprisoned and his widow sued San Diego county for negligence. In 2017, San Diego county claimed they didn't know about any problems with inmate deaths despite the widespread media coverage, and demanded that Davis provide her private investigative \"notes, interviews and recordings\" to help in San Diego's case against the widow. Davis refused. Many media outlets decried the request as inappropriate and a judge ordered a stay. It's been insinuated that San Diego county is trying to target or punish Davis for bringing negative media attention regarding the inmate deaths. === California right-to-die law === Davis received national attention in 2016 for an essay she wrote about Betsy, her sister, who had a \"Rebirth Party\" and used California's new right-to-die law to commit suicide in August 2015. == Personal life == Davis' sister Betsy committed suicide by drug in August 2015. Davis is currently fighting advanced breast cancer. == References == == External links == *Voices of San Diego - Kelly Davis Category:American newspaper journalists Category:American women journalists Category:American women writers Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
