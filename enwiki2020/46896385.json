    "text": "Koit (Estonian: \"Dawn\") is a song by T\u00f5nis M\u00e4gi, made popular during the Estonian Singing Revolution. It is often seen as M\u00e4gi's signature song. The song is a protest song, promoting the aims of Estonians looking to secede from the Soviet Union. The lyric is quite allusive, with references to a \"new dawn\" breaking. The final lines, however, make M\u00e4gi's point explicit, as he sings (in translation): Land, land of my fathers, so sacred a land Which must now be free Our song, our song of freedom will sound And you will see a free Estonia. The song is frequently performed at the Estonian Laulupidu and other patriotic events. Category:Estonian songs Category:Year of song missing ",
