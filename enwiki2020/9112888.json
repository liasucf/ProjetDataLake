    "text": "Joseph ben Simeon Kara ( 1065 \u2013 c. 1135) (), also known as Mahari Kara, was a French Bible exegete who was born and lived in Troyes. ==Biography== His uncle and teacher was Menachem ben Helbo, whom \u1e32ara often cites in his commentaries, these quotations being almost the only source of knowledge concerning Menahem's exegesis. \u1e32ara frequented Rashi's house; it is even possible that he was Rashi's pupil,Zunz, Z.G. p. 68. though this is denied by A. Epstein. They each quote from the other.Compare Joseph \u1e32ara on Proverbs 4:4, 5:14, 6:23, 18:22; Rashi on Judges 3:26; Numbers 17:5, 24:14; Isaiah 10:24 In Rashi's house \u1e32ara also made the acquaintance of Samuel ben Me\u00efr.Compare RaSHBaM on Gen. 37:13 They likewise quote each other.Compare RaSHBaM on Genesis 24:60 and Numbers iv.10; Rosin, R. Samuel ben Me\u00efr, pp. 12 et seq., 72 et seq.; Joseph \u1e32ara on Amos 3:12; Job 11:17; Gen. 10:15; Porges, in Monatsschrift, 1883, p. 169. Isaac \u1e32ara, of whose exegesis specimens are given in Monatsschrift, 1864, p. 219; 1865, p. 384,Compare Rosin, l.c. pp. 24 et seq. may be Joseph's son. The surname \"\u1e32ara\" is usually taken to be a professional name, meaning \"reader\" or \"interpreter of the Bible\".See Jew. Encyc. iii.168, s.v. Bible Exegesis Adolf Jellinek points out, however,Commentarien zu Esther, Ruth, etc., p. vi, Leipzig, 1855. that \"\u1e32ara,\" as contrasted with \"Darshan,\" means the representative of the \"Pesha\u1e6d\" (\"Pash\u1e6dan\"). He was among the first French exegetes and the forerunner of the French school of exegetes later to come. They were all to some extent influenced by his works, most notably among them, the Rashbam. Rashi too was influenced by R. Yosef who repeated his teacher's comments to him and incorporated several of them in his commentary.The Rishonim, The Artscroll history series. Entry R. Yosef Kara. == Works == \u1e32ara was a prolific exegetical writer. When he copied Rashi's commentary on the Pentateuch he added numerous glosses and remarks in order to supplement and revise it; and these glosses were inserted by the scribes in the text of Rashi. They have been collected.By A. Geiger in Ni\u1e6d'e Na'amanim, i.1 et seq.; idem in Parschandatha, pp. 21 et seq.; and by Abraham Berliner in Pleitath Soferim (Hebr. part), p. 12. The original or independent Bible commentaries of \u1e32ara are: * According to Berliner,l.c. p. 16 a commentary on Deuteronomy 1-4printed l.c. [Hebr. part], pp. 6 et seq. * Commentaries on the Prophets published in Mi\u1e33ra'ot Gedolot, Lublin, 1897;See Samuel Poznanski in Zeit. f\u00fcr Hebr. Bibl. v.68 extracts from these commentaries were published by Wolf;In Ha-Sha\u1e25ar, ii.289, iii.688, iv.55l see also, L. Dukes in Orient, Lit. 1847, p. 344 by LittmannIn Josef ben Simeon Kara, pp. 26\u201332 (from Isaiah and Ezekiel. Those on Samuel and most of the Minor Prophets are not genuine.Porges, in Monatsschrift, 1883, p. 170; Rosin, l.c. p. 72, note 2 The Jeremiah commentary was published separately by Schlossberg;(Commentaire sur Jer\u00e9mie, Paris, 1881; comp.

Ashkenazi,Divre \u1e24akhamim, pp. 17 et seq., Metz, 1849 and by S. Buber in two different recensions.In Kaufmann Gedenkbuch, pp. 8 et seq. ** Ecclesiastes, published by H\u00fcbsch (l.c.) and Einsteinin Berliner's Magazin, xiii.

Saraval No. 27, and ascribed to Joseph \u1e32ara, are not genuine.A. Geiger, in O\u1e93ar Ne\u1e25mad, iv.43 et seq. Some comments of \u1e32ara on Chronicles must have existed, as is proved by the quotations in pseudo-Rashi to those books (see II Chronicles 3:15, 5:9, 25:24). According to Epstein,l.c. i.29 et seq. \u1e32ara wrote additionally * glosses to the pseudo-Rashi commentary on Genesis Rabbah, and * a commentary on the Machzorcompare Zunz, Ritus, p. 198 === Characteristics === While in his glosses on the Pentateuch and in his commentaries on the Prophets \u1e32ara depends upon Rashi to the greatest extent, his explanations of the Hagiographa are more original. He quotes Menahem ben Saru\u1e33, Dunash ibn Labra\u1e6d, Judah and Moses ha-Darshan, \u1e32alir, Me\u00efr Shelia\u1e25 \u1e92ibbur, Kalonymus, and others. In his commentary on Book of Job he frequently uses the writings of Shabbethai Donnolo, and gives very valuable extracts from the lost Baraita of Samuel with Donnolo's commentary (comp. Epstein, l.c. pp. 34 et seq.). His grammatical standpoint is that of Rashi. Whole Hebrew sentences are sometimes translated into French. In his expressions he is not as terse as Rashi. He is bold enough to express the opinion that the Book of Samuel was not written by the prophet himself, but later (Commentary on I Samuel ix.9). He does not go into grammatical or philological research, and cares more for the sense of the whole sentence than for a single word. He shows more common sense than depth, and though he does not altogether hold aloof from aggadic interpretations, he takes a leading place among the exegetes of northern France, who in general preferred the rational exegesis. == References == Its bibliography: *Heinrich Gr\u00e4tz, Gesch. vi.145; *Henri Gross, Gallia Judaica, p. 227; *Einstein, in Berliner's Magazin, xiii.206 et seq.; *Ernest Renan-Adolf Neubauer, Les Rabbins Fran\u00e7ais, pp. 435, 438, 441, 488, 558; *Leopold Zunz, G.V. 2d ed., pp. 313, 410; *idem, Z.G.
