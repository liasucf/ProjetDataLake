The daughter of Leftfield cofounder Neil Barnes, Georgia began her music career as a drummer for artists such as Kwes and Kate Tempest. She began her career as a singer and record producer with the release of her debut studio album Georgia (2015). Her second studio album Seeking Thrills was released in January 2020. Georgia is signed to the label Domino. In 2018 she released the song \"Started Out\". In 2019 she performed at the Glastonbury Festival and won the Association of Independent Music's One to Watch award in association with BBC Music Introducing. Vice have described her sound as \"euphoric, late-night dance\", while her 2015 self-titled album was compared to Missy Elliot and MIA. Talking about her 2019 single \"About Work the Dancefloor\" with Sean Tayler from Futuremag Music, Georgia shared \"I made this song after a weekend in Berlin entirely dancing in a few clubs and I realised how important the dancefloor is to people to give them a certain relief from their everyday activities\". Her album Seeking Thrills was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize 2020. ==Early life== Georgia Rose Harriet Barnes was born in London; her father is Neil Barnes, the cofounder and keyboardist of English electronic music group Leftfield. As a child, Georgia was a footballer who had played in youth squads associated with Queens Park Rangers W.F.C. and Arsenal W.F.C. She left football after the death of her coach, when she described things as getting \"too intense\". Barnes attended the BRIT School in the London Borough of Croydon, where she began playing the drums professionally. ==Personal life== In a 2019 interview with Billboard, Barnes discussed her decision to quit alcohol and become vegan. ==Discography== === Studio albums === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Details ! colspan=\"4\" scope=\"col\" | Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font- size:90%;\"| UK ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"|UK Indie ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"|UK Down ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| BEL (FL) |- ! scope=\"row\"| Georgia | * Released: 7 August 2015 * Label: Domino * Format: CD, digital download, streaming |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Seeking Thrills | * Released: 10 January 2020 * Label: Domino * Format: Vinyl, CD, digital download, streaming |24 |1 |5 |139 |- |} === Singles === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\"| Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| BEL (FL) Tip ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| BEL (WA) Tip ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| MEX Airplay ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| US Dance |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2015 ! scope=\"row\" |\"Move Systems\" |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 | rowspan=\"2\" |Georgia |- ! scope=\"row\" |\"Nothing Solutions\" |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |- |2017 ! scope=\"row\" |\"Feel It\" |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 | rowspan=\"6\" |Seeking Thrills |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2018 ! scope=\"row\" |\"Mellow\" |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" |\"Started Out\" |26 |31 |\u2014 |\u2014 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2019 ! scope=\"row\" |\"About Work the Dancefloor\" |44 |\u2014 |5 |\u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" |\"Never Let You Go\" |36 |\u2014 |12 |\u2014 |- |2020 ! scope=\"row\" |\"24 Hours\" |41 |40 |\u2014 |30 |} ===Guest appearances=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:17em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"6\"| Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font- size:85%;\" |UK ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\" | AUS ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\" | CAN ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\" | NL ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font- size:85%;\" |SCO ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\" |US |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Location Unknown\" | rowspan=\"3\"| 2018 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | Love Me / Love Me Not |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Days Forever\" | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | Color The Weather |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Summer Blues\" | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | Nature |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Xhosa\" | rowspan=\"3\"| 2019 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | Africa Express Presents: Molo |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"City In Lights\" | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | rowspan=\"2\"| Egoli |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Mama\" | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Live Like We're Dancing\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2020 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | R.Y.C |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Aries\" | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | Song Machine |} ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Year !Organization !Award !Work !Result !Ref. |- | rowspan=\"5\" |2019 | Rober Awards Music Prize | Floorfiller of the Year | rowspan=2|\"About Work the Dancefloor\" | | |- | rowspan=2 |AIM Independent Music Awards | Independent Track of the Year | | rowspan=2| |- | One to Watch | rowspan=\"3\" |Herself | |- | MTV Europe Music Award | Best Push Act | |- | BBC | Sound of 2020 | |- | rowspan=3 |2020 | rowspan=2 |NME Awards | Best British Song | rowspan=2 |\"About Work the Dancefloor\" | | rowspan=2 | |- | Best Song in the World | |- | MTV EMA Awards | Best Push | Herself | |- |} ==Notes== ==References== Category:1990 births Category:21st-century English singers Category:21st-century English women singers Category:English drummers Category:English female pop singers Category:English female singer-songwriters Category:English record producers Category:English women in electronic music Category:Living people Category:Musicians from London Category:Synth-pop singers ",
