The population in 2011 was 3,757,Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica in an area of 5.98 km2.Eurostat It is located on the periphery of the urbanized area of the city of Angra do Hero\u00edsmo (approximately four from the center), and developed from a small fishing port in a bay along the volcanic coast of the island (calheta is Portuguese for small bay). ==History== A view of S\u00e3o Mateus da Calheta in 1903 During the early period of settlement, the S\u00e3o Mateus coast was dotted by bays, some peppered with small beaches. One of these, which became known as Prainha, soon became the centre of a small fishing port. Gaspar Frutuoso, writing in his sixth volume of Saudades da Terra, referred to the area as S\u00e3o Mateus da Prainha, noting: \"In addition to the church of S\u00e3o Mateus Al\u00e9m, is a small bay of white sand and small stones in places, where on occasion they throw-out their nets and trammels to catch many fish, principally mullet.\" It was Pedro de Merelim who first coined the name S\u00e3o Mateus da Prainha, in his chapter on the parish, in As 18 par\u00f3quias de Angra. During the 1580s, in anticipation of eventual attacks by forces loyal to King Philip II of Spain, the first forts began to be constructed along the coast: six forts lined the banks of the parishes coast, which included the Grande Fort and the Fort of Negrito. They served the purpose of defending political activities in the archipelago, but also safeguarded the pillaging from pirates and privateers that occurred during this period (which was the justification for the construction of the Fort of the Terreiro, the Fort of the Mar\u00e9, the Fort of M\u00e1 Ferramenta and the Fort of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o (S\u00e3o Mateus da Calheta) (also known as the Fort of Biscoitinho). The final defences were completed during the Second World War, with the extension of trenches and installation of gun emplacements. Father Manuel Lu\u00eds Maldonado, writing in his work Fenix Nagrense, recounted the penitence of the peoples of the parish, as a sequence of the 26 March 1690 storm and 5 April 1690 earthquake. These accounts explain the strong relationship between the parish of S\u00e3o Mateus and S\u00e3o Bartolomeu de Regatos, and the existence of a parochial church in the vicinity of the old church, the reference to fishing and the level of poverty. Father Ant\u00f3nio Cordeiro, writing in 1710 wrote of large estates, the coastal fortresses (some with more than 9 pieces of artillery), their garrisons and of the community of S\u00e3o Matues \"with more than 50 neighbours\" spread across the territory. Cordeiro also wrote of the fishing: \"...this bay in S\u00e3o Mateus, of white sand and small pebbles, where they catch a lot of fish, and salmonettes.\" The primitive parochial church, constructed at Ponta de S. Mateus around 1557, would substitute the older chapel. During the construction, the people returned to the smaller Hermitage of Luz to complete the weekly rituals. The new church (today known as the Old Church) was completed in 1700, and functioned in that role until a 28 August 1893 hurricane when the church was destroyed and abandoned. Between 1694 and 1700 the church was demolished and reconstructed farther to the interior: a cross was left in the former churchyard. Writing in 1834, Lu\u00eds de Meireles do Canto e Castro, a local resident, complained of the poor protection the seawall offered, resulting in repeated encroachments by the sea. During the 18th century and early 19th century, the population grew rapidly and the first defensive structure began appearing along the Terreiro and beach near the port. After the 18th century the character of the parish began to change: the population grew and much of the economic activity moved away the orchards of the local estates. ==Geography== The civil parish occupies a small triangular territory along the southern coast of Terceira, confined in the south by the sea, west by the civil parish of S\u00e3o Bartolomeu de Regatos, northeast by Terra Ch\u00e3 and east by S\u00e3o Pedro. ===Physical geography=== The territory extends through the transition al zone within the Santa B\u00e1rbara massif and volcanic complex of the Serra do Mori\u00e3o, in a zone that is relatively low, with a slope of less than five percent grade until elevation, along a north-northwest tract. The highest point in the parish is situated in the extreme north of Canada da Cruz Dourada along Canada de Tr\u00e1s. In the central part of the territory is the basaltic spatter cone Pico dos Merens: its peak is named after one of the local families who, for centuries, were local property-owners in the region: the Merens of T\u00e1vora. Also known as Pico de Merens or Pico do Alvernaz, the cone is elevation, and responsible for the Biscoitinho Platform that extends to the sea. The Biscoitinho Platform, over which the main built-up part of the civil parish is situated, terminates at small rectangular promontory consisting of several coves and bays. One of these bays, which is relatively deep, provided shelter for early settlers from western and southwestern weather systems, giving rise to the port of S\u00e3o Mateus. Another cove to the west, which is wider and open to the sea, resulted in the settlement of Terreiro. To the east and west of the Biscoitinho Platform the coast is low, with altitudes less than , consisting of basalt primarily, with some pyroclasts. The exception is the zone of Ponta de S\u00e3o Mateus, near the old church, where the coast is covered in a thick layer of ignimbrites. To the east of the port there two areas, Ba\u00eda das Merc\u00eas and Po\u00e7o da Luz, where the coast is almost level with the sea, and where stone beaches are common. Historically, there have been records of tsunamis or southerly swells that have inundated the areas (the last occurring on 18 February 2003), while the area the territory is delimited by wall to protect the roadway.Liduino Borba (2003), pp.90-97 West, after the Calheta do Terreiro, the coast extends further into the sea, yet still only less than above sea level, forming the tip of S\u00e3o Mateus. Being on the coast, the area is influenced by Atlantic storms, resulting in the construction of various barriers. In the small bay of Negrito, historically defended by the Fort of Negrito and location of a former whaling port, are the principal swimming areas on the island. After Negrito is the western limit of the civil parish in the area known as Chanoca, an area of basalt cliffs with difficult access. ===Human geography=== The parochial church is at the centre of the old fishing community of S\u00e3o Mateus. A juxtoposition of the parochial church and the Fort Grande Holy Spirit Chapel The structure of S\u00e3o Mateus is different from other parishes in the southwest corner of Terceira, with a specific economy associated with fishing and services. While the upper regions of the parish has marked by rural character, the central area is primarily urban, centred around the parochial church and fishing community. The parish contains the localities Bairro Novo, Canada da Cruz Dourada, Canada da Igreja, Canada do Capit\u00e3o Mor, Canada do Pombal, Canada dos Cal\u00e7os, Canada dos Folhadais, Canada Francesa, S\u00e3o Mateus and Terra P\u00e3o. These 50 named agglomerations are connected by a patchwork of linear roadways extending from the Estrada Regional E.R.1-1\u00aa, organized into:Liduino Borba (2003), p.89 * S\u00e3o Mateus \u2014 the main village, centred on Biscoitinho and port, includes a dense urban concentration with numerous roads and cul de sacs, characterized by the homes of the poor and fishermen. Towards the west the agglomeration abruptly terminates at Terreiro, limited by the zone of Arrife, which is almost underpopulated, except for the homes of the early gentry and noble classes of Angra. In the east, towards Angra do Hero\u00edsmo, the urban area extends along the coast, broken by the Fortress of S\u00e3o Mateus da Calheta, towards the social housing of the Bairro dos Pescadores constructed during the Estado Novo regime. The construction of social housing in Terreiro, the periphery of the Bairro dos Pescadores and beginning of the Canada da Arruda resulted in a high urban density, giving the parish the character of an extension of Angra. In the extreme east of the parish, in the zone between Po\u00e7o da Luz and the border with S\u00e3o Pedro, are many of the 18th and 19th century estates that pertained to the aristocratic families of Terceira; * Cantinho \u2014 this is the secondary urban agglomeration of the parish, characterized by linear growth along the route between Angra and S\u00e3o Bartolomeu dos Regatos (known as the Caminho do Meio). Its center is situated at the Hermitage of S\u00e3o Francisco das Almas, a name that once served as the toponymic reference, but actually includes Entre- Ladeiras, Terra do P\u00e3o and Canada da Francesa. It is a zone that is markedly rural, inhabited by farmers and similar to the parishes of the western part of the island, and socially separate from the rest of the parish, with its own primary school, imp\u00e9rio and parochial churches.; * The Canadas \u2014 connecting the coastal roadway (or Caminho de Baixo) with the Angra-S\u00e3o Bartolomeu dos Regatos access (Caminho do Meio) are several secondary lines of residences known as Canadas da Luz, da Arruda, do Capit\u00e3o-Mor and da Cruz Dourada, that were extended linearly along these roads. These were transitional spaces, lightly populated, between the coastal fishing communities and their rural interior. These Canadas were transformed into new extensions of Angra, as bedroom communities. ==Architecture== ===Military=== * Fort of Negrito () * Fortress of S\u00e3o Mateus da Calheta () * Fort of the Church of S\u00e3o Mateus da Calheta () ===Religious=== * Church of S\u00e3o Mateus da Calheta () * Church of S\u00e3o Mateus da Calheta (Old) (), dating to the mid 16th-century, the Igreja Velha (Old Church) was built to replace the old hermitage of Nossa Senhora da Luz, but its location (along the coast) made it susceptible to winter storms and hurricanes; on 28 August 1893, it was hit by a hurricane resulting in the destruction of most of its roof, and its eventual abandon. It was replaced by the main parochial church. * Imp\u00e9rio do Esp\u00edrito Santo do Cantinho * Imp\u00e9rio do Esp\u00edrito Santo do Terreiro *Imp\u00e9rio do Esp\u00edritu Santo de S\u00e3o Mateus da Calheta, a Holy Spirit Chapel dating from 1873 ==References== Category:Parishes of Angra do Hero\u00edsmo ",
