    "text": "Dylan Schneider (born October 9, 1999) is an American country music singer and songwriter. He self-released his debut extended play, Wannabe in August 2016. Labelled \"Country Music's Next Rising Star\" by Billboard, Schneider has landed two EPs in the top 20 of the magazine's Heatseekers Albums chart in under a year without a label to support them. ==Career== Schneider was a fan of pop and hip hop music as a child, but later became attracted to the storytelling aspect of country music and began singing at the age of 14. After meeting Brett Eldredge at a concert in the singer's hometown (Paris, Illinois), Schneider was invited onstage by Eldredge to perform a song during the latter's performance in Terre Haute. He then began writing and performing songs both around Indiana and in Nashville, Tennessee. Between 2014 and 2016, Schneider posted a number of videos to YouTube of him performing cover versions of popular country songs, which earned him attention online. The first video was posted on May 18, 2014. Schneider released his debut EP, Wannabe, on August 19, 2016. His second EP, 17, was released the day after Scheneider's seventeenth birthday and reached number 37 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. In February 2017, Schneider released his first radio single, \"You Heard Wrong\". He released his third EP, Spotlight's on You, on April 14, 2017. The record sold 1,700 copies in its first week, propelling the EP into the top 10 of the Heatseekers Albums chart. Schneider released his fourth EP, Whole Town Talk, in August 2019. The EP was released by Interscope Records through a partnership with Round Here Records; an independent label founded by Tyler Hubbard and Brian Kelley of the Florida Georgia Line who also co-wrote several of the new tracks. It was also announced Schneider would join Florida Georgia Line for select dates of their Can\u2019t Say I Ain\u2019t Country Tour alongside Dan + Shay, Morgan Wallen, and Canaan Smith. ==Discography== ===EPs=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of extended plays, with selected details, chart positions, and sales ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:9em;\" | Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| EP details ! colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:9em;\" | Sales |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:4em;\" | US Country ! style=\"width:4em;\" | US Heat ! style=\"width:4em;\" | US Indie |- ! scope=\"row\"| Wannabe | * Release date: August 19, 2016 * Label: Dylan Schneider | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || |- ! scope=\"row\"| 17 | * Release date: October 9, 2016 * Label: Dylan Schneider | 37 || 14 || \u2014 || |- ! scope=\"row\"| Spotlight's on You | * Release date: April 14, 2017 * Label: Dylan Schneider | \u2014 || 9 || 29 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Whole Town Talk | * Release date: August 23, 2019 * Label: Interscope Records | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | * US: 300 |- | colspan=\"6\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of singles, with release year and affiliated album ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:1em;\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:8em;\" | Album |- style=\"font- size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:4em;\" | US Country Airplay |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"How Does It Sound\" | 2018 | 45 | |} ===Music videos=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of music videos, showing year released and director ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1em;\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8em;\" | Director(s) |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Two Black X's\" | 2016 | rowspan=\"2\"| Randy Shaffer |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"You Heard Wrong\" | 2017 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"How Does It Sound\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2018 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"No Problem\" | |} ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Dylan Schneider at AllMusic * Official website Category:American country singer-songwriters Category:American male singer-songwriters Category:Living people Category:1999 births Category:21st- century American singers Category:Country musicians from Indiana Category:21st-century male singers ",
