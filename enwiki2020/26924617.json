    "text": "A forward freight agreement (FFA) is a financial forward contract that allows ship owners, charterers and speculators to hedge against the volatility of freight rates. It gives the contract owner the right to buy and sell the price of freight for future dates. FFAs are built on an index composed of a shipping route for tanker or a basket of routes for dry bulk, contracts are traded \u2018over the counter\u2019 on a principal-to-principal basis and can be cleared through a clearing house. == References == * The Baltic Exchange: What is an FFA?
