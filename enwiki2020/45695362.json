Groom & Sons with Henry now a director. When his father died in August 1901, Henry became managing director and remained in that position until the Grooms sold their interest in the business to the Dunn family in 1922. ==Political career== In 1904, Groom unsuccessfully contested the seat of Drayton and Toowoomba in the Queensland Legislative Assembly following the death of John Fogarty.
