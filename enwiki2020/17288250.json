    "text": "Power100 (callsign 4RGR) is a commercial Australian station based in Townsville, Queensland, owned by Grant Broadcasters. ==History== Power100 was established as Sea FM in 1999 by RG Capital, headed by Reg Grundy. In 2003, the station was sold alongside sister station Mix FM (now Star 106.3) to Macquarie Southern Cross Media, owners of rivals 4TO FM and Hot FM. However, Macquarie was forced to sell two stations to ensure diversity in the market, and in 2005 Mix FM and Sea FM were sold to Prime Media Group. In 2013, Prime Media Group sold its radio division to Grant Broadcasters. In 2016, the station rebranded from Zinc 100.7 to Power100. ==See also== *Media in Townsville ==External links== *Official website Category:Townsville Category:Radio stations in Queensland Category:Classic rock radio stations in Australia Category:Grant Broadcasters ",
