Captured at one point, Urrac\u00e1 managed to escape a ship bound for Spain and rejoin his people. He continued to lead the fight against the Spanish until he was killed in battle in 1531. He is remembered as el caudillo amerindio de Veragua (the Amerind leader of Veragua) and adversary of the Spanish Empire), the great resistance leader of Panama. He has been honored by his image on the centesimo, the smallest-denomination coin of Panama. ==History== Shortly after the foundation of Panama City in 1519, the Spanish Governor-Captain Pedrarias D\u00e1vila began moving into the country, hoping to find a gold-rich village. The Spanish conquered the Veragua province, which is particularly rich in gold mining. Urrac\u00e1's territory was in the vicinity of the present town of Nata de los Caballeros, founded on 20 May 1520 to serve as a basis for exploration of the rest of Central America. Urrac\u00e1 and his forces bravely faced the Spanish expedition for almost nine years, and repeatedly defeated the conquistadors, led by Gaspar de Espinosa. When Espinosa was called back to Panama City by Pedrarias D\u00e1vila, Francisco de Compa\u00f1\u00f3n was commissioned to his post. Urrac\u00e1 attacked the Spanish warriors, but Compa\u00f1\u00f3n sent a messenger to report to Panama City to seek aid, and Pedrarias sent a relief battalion led by Hern\u00e1n Ponce de Le\u00f3n. Urrac\u00e1 succeeded in making alliances with tribes that had been traditional enemies, in order to unite to defeat the Spaniards. 18649121 Caciques such as Ponca, Dures, Duraria, Bulaba, Guisia, Guaniaga, Tabor, Guracona, Guaniagos and other great masters of Veragua united under his command. Ponce de Le\u00f3n succeeded in breaking the siege of Nata, and he was followed by Pedrarias commanding new forces that reinforced the Spanish at Nata. Bloody clashes continued, without any of the parties achieving complete victory. In a subsequent battle, Urrac\u00e1's forces managed to defeat Captain Diego de Albitres, who escaped and reported to the governor of Castilla del Oro. ===Capture of Urrac\u00e1=== Led by Compa\u00f1\u00f3n, the Spanish attempted to capture Urrac\u00e1 with a trick. They sent emissaries to his territory to propose peace negotiations in Nata de los Caballeros. Urrac\u00e1 accepted the invitation and attended the site along with two of his men, but Compa\u00f1\u00f3n captured him, sending the chief to Nombre de Dios for transport to Spain. Urrac\u00e1 escaped and reunited with his people, maintaining his resistance against the Spanish forces for several years. ==Recognition== Opposite the facade of Escuela Normal in the city of Santiago, capital of the province of Veraguas, stands a statue of Urrac\u00e1 with a warrior expression as if willing to attack the Spanish conquistadors. In his honor, the Asociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Scouts de Panam\u00e1 calls Scout Urrac\u00e1 the highest rank awarded to those who have made outstanding community service. ==See also== *Lempira (Lenca ruler) ==Notes== ==References== ;Attribution *This article is based on the translation of the corresponding article of the Spanish Wikipedia.
