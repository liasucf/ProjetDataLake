Ibn al-Nadim lists nearly 140 titles attributed to Al- Jahiz, of which 75 are extant. The best known are Kit\u0101b al-\u00ad\u1e24ayaw\u0101n (The book of living), a seven-part compendium on an array of subjects with animals as their point of departure; Kit\u0101b al-Bay\u0101n wa-l-taby\u012bn (The book of eloquence and exposition), a wide-ranging work on human communication; and Kit\u0101b al- Bukhal\u0101\u02be (The book of misers), a collection of anecdotes on stinginess. He is said to have been crushed to death under the weight of his own tomes. ==Life== He was Ab\u016b \u02bfUthman \u02bfAmr ibn Bahr ibn Ma\u1e25b\u016bb, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Ab\u016b al-Qallamas \u2018Amr ibn Qal\u2018 al-Kin\u0101n\u012b, then al-Fuqaym\u012b, a.k.a. \u2018Amr ibn Qal\u2018 al-Kin\u0101n\u012b al-Fuqaym\u012b whose ancestor was one of the Nasah (Nasa\u2019ah). The grandfather of al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 was a Black jamm\u0101l (cameleer) or \u1e25amm\u0101l (porter); the manuscripts differ.of \u2018Amr ibn Qal\u2018 named Ma\u1e25b\u016bb, nicknamed Faz\u0101rah, or Faz\u0101rah was his maternal grandfather, and Ma\u1e25b\u016bb his paternal. The names may however have been confused. Al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 died 250 [A.D. 869], during the caliphate of al-Mu\u2018tazz. Al-Nad\u012bm reports that al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 said he was about the same age as Ab\u016b Nuw\u0101s and older than al-Jamm\u0101z. Not much is known about al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93's early life, but his family was very poor. Born in Basra early in 160/February 776, he asserted in a book he wrote that he was a member of the Arabian tribe Banu Kinanah.Al- Jahiz messages, Alwarraq edition, page 188; Y\u0101q\u016bt, Irsh\u0101d al-ar\u012bb il\u00e1 ma`rifat al-ad\u012bb, ed. I\u1e25s\u0101n `Abb\u0101s, 7 vols (Beirut: D\u0101r al-Gharb al-Isl\u0101m\u012b, 1993), 5:2102.; Y\u0101q\u016bt, Irsh\u0101d al-ar\u012bb il\u00e1 ma`rifat al-ad\u012bb, ed.

He sold fish along one of the canals in Basra to help his family. Financial difficulties, however, did not stop al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 from continuously seeking knowledge. He used to gather with a group of other youths at Basra's main mosque, where they would discuss different scientific subjects. During the cultural and intellectual revolution under the Abbasid Caliphate books became readily available, and learning accessible. Al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 studied philology, lexicography and poetry from among the most learned scholars at the School of Basra, where he attended the lectures of Ab\u016b Ubaydah, Al-A\u1e63ma\u2019\u012b, Sa'\u012bd ibn Aws al-An\u1e63\u0101r\u012b and studied ilm an-na\u1e25w (, i.e., syntax) with al-Akhfash Ab\u012b al-\u1e24asan. Over a twenty-five-year span studying, al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 acquired a considerable knowledge of Arabic poetry, Arabic philology, pre-Islamic Arab history, the Qur'an and the Hadiths. He read translated books on Greek sciences and Hellenistic philosophy, especially that of the Greek philosopher Aristotle. Al-Jahiz, was also critical of those who followed oral Hadiths, referring to his Hadithist opponents as al-nabita (\"the contemptible\"). ==Career== A giraffe from Kit\u0101b al-Hayaw\u0101n (Book of the Animals) by al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93. While still in Basra, al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 wrote an article about the institution of the Caliphate. This is said to have been the beginning of his career as a writer, which would become his sole source of living. It is said that his mother once offered him a tray full of notebooks and told him he would earn his living from writing. He went on to write two hundred books in his lifetime on a variety of subjects, including on the Quran, Arabic grammar, zoology, poetry, lexicography, and rhetoric. Of his writings, only thirty books survive. Al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 was also one of the first Arabic writers to suggest a complete overhaul of the language's grammatical system, though this would not be undertaken until his fellow linguist Ibn Ma\u1e0d\u0101\u02be took up the matter two hundred years later.Shawqi Daif, Introduction to Ibn Mada's Refutation of the Grammarians, pg. 48. Cairo, 1947. Al-Nad\u012bm cited this passage from a book of al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93: > \u201cWhen I was writing these two books, about the creation of the Qur\u2019\u0101n, which > was the tenet given importance and honour by the Commander of the Faithful, > and another about superiority in connection with the Ban\u016b H\u0101shim, the \u2018Abd > Shams, and Makhz\u016bm. what was my due but to sit above the Simak\u0101n, Spica and > Arcturus, or on top of the \u2018Ayy\u016bq, or to deal with red sulphur, or to > conduct the \u2018Anq\u0101 by her leading string to the Greatest King. Al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 moved to Baghdad, then the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate, in 816 AD, because the caliphs encouraged scientists and scholars and had just founded the library of the Bayt al-\u1e24ikmah. But al-Nadim suspected a claim by al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 that the caliph al-Ma\u2019m\u016bn had praised his books on the imamate and the caliphate, for his eloquent phraseology, and use of market-place speech, and that of the elite and of the kings, was exaggerated self-glorification and doubted al-Ma\u2019m\u016bn could have spoken these words. Al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 was said to have admired the eloquent literary style of the director of the library, Sahl ibn H\u0101r\u016bn (d. 859/860) and quoted his works. Because of the caliphs' patronage and his eagerness to establish himself and reach a wider audience, al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 stayed in Baghdad. Al-Nad\u012bm gives two versions of an anecdote which differ in their source: his first source is Ab\u016b Hiff\u0101n and his second is the grammarian al- Mubarrad, and retells the story of al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93's reputation for being one of the three great bibliophiles and scholarsthe two others being al-Fat\u1e25 ibn Kh\u0101q\u0101n and judge Ism\u0101\u2019\u012bl ibn Is\u1e25\u0101q such that \u201cwhenever a book came into the hand of al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 he read through it, wherever he happened to be. He even used to rent the shops of al-warr\u0101q\u016bn for study.\u201d Al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 replaced Ibr\u0101h\u012bm ibn al-\u2018Abb\u0101s al-\u1e62\u016bl\u012b in the government secretariat of al-Ma\u2019m\u016bn but left after just three days. Later at Samarra) he wrote a huge number of his books. The caliph al- Ma'mun wanted al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 to teach his children, but then changed his mind when his children were frightened by al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93's boggle-eyes (). This is said to be the origin of his nickname. He enjoyed the patronage of al-Fath ibn Khaqan, the bibliophile boon companion of Caliph al-Mutawakkil, but after his murder in December 861 he left Samarra for his native Basra, where he lived on his estate with his \u201cconcubine, her maid, a manservant, and a donkey.\u201d He died there in late 868, according to one story, when a pile of books from his private library collapsed on him. == Foreshadowing of Evolution == Al-Jahiz writes in Kitab al-Hayawan (IV,68) \"Lice are black on the head of a young man with black hair, light on that of a hoary old man.\" This is most clear example of micro-evolution. Al-Jahiz furthermore describes the struggle for existence and natural selection. ==Most important books== A page from al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93's Kit\u0101b al-Hayaw\u0101n depicting an ostrich (Struthio camelus) in a nest with eggs. Basra. ===Kit\u0101b al-\u1e24ayaw\u0101n () \u2018Book of the Animals\u2019=== Kit\u0101b al-\u1e24ayaw\u0101n is an encyclopedia in seven volumes of anecdotes, poetic descriptions and proverbs describing over 350 Species of animals. Composed in honour of Mu\u1e25ammad ibn \u2018Abd al-M\u0101lik al-Zayy\u0101t, who paid him five thousand gold coins (5., d\u012bn\u0101r). The 11th-century scholar Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi dismissed it as \"little more than a plagiarism\" of Aristotle's Kit\u0101b al-Hayaw\u0101na charge of plagiarism was levelled against Aristotle himself with regard to a certain \"Asclepiades of Pergamum\". Later scholars have noted that there was only a limited Aristotelian influence in al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93's work, and that al-Baghdadi may have been unacquainted with Aristotle's work. Conway Zirkle, writing about the history of natural selection science in 1941, said that an excerpt from this work was the only relevant passage he had found from an Arabian scholar. He provided a quotation describing the struggle for existence, citing a Spanish translation of this work: > The rat goes out for its food, and is clever in getting it, for it eats all > animals inferior to it in strength\", and in turn, it \"has to avoid snakes > and birds and serpents of prey, who look for it in order to devour it\" and > are stronger than the rat. Mosquitos \"know instinctively that blood is the > thing which makes them live\" and when they see an animal, \"they know that > the skin has been fashioned to serve them as food\". In turn, flies hunt the > mosquito \"which is the food that they like best\", and predators eat the > flies. \"All animals, in short, can not exist without food, neither can the > hunting animal escape being hunted in his turn. Every weak animal devours > those weaker than itself. Strong animals cannot escape being devoured by > other animals stronger than they. And in this respect, men do not differ > from animals, some with respect to others, although they do not arrive at > the same extremes. In short, God has disposed some human beings as a cause > of life for others, and likewise, he has disposed the latter as a cause of > the death of the former.\" ===Kit\u0101b al-Bukhal\u0101\u2019 () \u2018The Book of Misers\u2019 also (Avarice and the Avaricious)=== A collection of stories about the greedy. Humorous and satirical, it is the best example of al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93' prose style. Al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 ridicules schoolmasters, beggars, singers and scribes for their greedy behavior. Many of the stories continue to be reprinted in magazines throughout the Arabic- speaking world. The book is considered one of the best works of al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93. Editions: Arabic (Al-\u1e24\u0101jir\u012b, Cairo, 1958); Arabic text, French preface. Le Livre des avares. (Pellat. Paris, 1951) ===Kit\u0101b al-Bay\u0101n wa-al-Taby\u012bn (The Book of eloquence and demonstration)=== al-Bayan wa al-Tabyin was one of al- J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93's later works, in which he wrote on epiphanies, rhetorical speeches, sectarian leaders, and princes. Though he was neither a poet nor a philologist in the proper sense \u2013 al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 took a keen interest in almost any imaginable subject \u2013 the book is considered to have started Arabic literary theory in a formal, systemic fashion.G. J. H. Van Gelder, Beyond the Line: Classical Arabic Literary Critics on the Coherence and Unity of the Poem, pg. 2. Volume 8 of Studies in Arabic literature: Supplements to the Journal of Arabic Literature. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1982. Al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93's defining of eloquence as the ability of the speaker to deliver an effective message while maintaining it as brief or elaborate at will was widely accepted by later Arabic literary critics.G.J. van Gelder, \"Brevity in Classical Arabic Literary Theory.\" Taken from Proceedings of the Ninth Congress of the Union Europ\u00e9enne Des Arabisants et Islamisants: Amsterdam, 1 to 7 September 1978, pg. 81. Ed. Rudolph Peters. Volume 4 of Publications of the Netherlands Institute of Archaeology and Arabic Studies in Cairo. Leiden: Brill Archive, 1981. ==On the Zanj [\"Swahili coast\"]== Concerning the Zanj, he wrote: In his book Al- Bay\u0101n al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 mentions that Blacks have an oratory and eloquence of their own culture and language. ==Mu\u2018tazil\u012b theological debate== Al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 intervened in a theological dispute between two Mu\u2019tazil\u012b, and defended Ab\u016b al-Hudhayl against the criticism of Bishr ibn al-Mu\u2018tamir. Another Mu\u2018tazilah theologian, Ja\u2018far ibn Mubashshir, wrote a \u201crefutation of al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93\u201d. 666 ==Death== Al- J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 returned to Basra with hemiplegia after spending more than fifty years in Baghdad. He died in Basra in the Arabic month of Muharram in AH 255/December 868 \u2013 January 869 AD. His exact cause of death is not clear, but a popular assumption is that al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 died in his private library after one of many large piles of books fell on him, killing him instantly. == See also == *Shu'ubiyya *Ajam *Al-J\u0101hiz (crater) *List of Arab scientists and scholars ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * * * * Montgomery, James (2013).
