    "text": "Group B of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualification tournament was one of the 12 groups to decide the teams which qualify for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations finals tournament. The group consisted of four teams: Cameroon, Morocco, Malawi, and Comoros (winner of preliminary round). The teams played against each other in home-and-away round-robin format between June 2017 and March 2019. On 12 March 2017, the Football Association of Malawi announced their senior national football team would withdraw from the competition due to the lack of funding. However, they later announced its reversal of this decision and would continue to compete. Morocco and Cameroon, the group winner and runner-up, qualified for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. Cameroon were the original hosts of the final tournament and would have been guaranteed of qualification regardless of their ranking; the matches of the team would have counted in determining the qualification of the other teams, and only the top team apart from Cameroon would have qualified for the final tournament. However, on 30 November 2018, Cameroon were stripped of hosting the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. due to the Boko Haram insurgency and the Anglophone Crisis. ==Standings== ==Matches== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ==Goalscorers== ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *32nd Edition Of Total Africa Cup Of Nations, CAFonline.com Group B ",
