After gaining IOC recognition in February 1936, Bermuda were invited to take part in the 1936 Summer Olympics. With the financial backing of Sir Howard Trott, a team of swimmers would be sent. Whitfield Fredrick \"Chummy\" Hayward a successful businessman and an accomplished athlete, arranged for American coach William Brooks to come to Bermuda to train the swimmers and also persuaded Leonard Spence an ex-world breaststroke record holder to move from British Guiana to Bermuda in order to compete for them. He traveled to Berlin as the team manager, and carried the flag at the opening ceremony. ==Swimming== {|class=wikitable style=\"font- size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Heat !colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal !colspan=\"2\"|Final |-style=\"font-size:95%\" !Time !Rank !Time !Rank !Time !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Percy Belvin |align=left|200 m breaststroke |3:09.08 |5 |colspan=4|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left|Edmund Cooper |align=left|400 m freestyle |5:53.8 |5 |colspan=4|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left|John Young |align=left|100 m freestyle |1:07.8 |6 |colspan=4|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left rowspan=2|Leonard Spence |align=left|100 m freestyle |1:01.9 |4 |colspan=4|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left|200 m breaststroke |2:52.0 |1 Q |colspan=2|DSQ |colspan=2|Did not advance |-align=centre |align=left|Edmund Cooper Leonard Spence Dudley Spurling John Young |align=left|4 \u00d7 200 m freestyle relay |10:50.5 |5 |colspan=2 |colspan=2|Did not advance |} ==References== *Official Olympic Reports * Category:Nations at the 1936 Summer Olympics 1936 Summer Olympics Category:1936 in Bermuda ",
