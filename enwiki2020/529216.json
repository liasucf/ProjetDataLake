    "text": "The Kane Gang were a pop trio from North East England that scored several UK and US hits in the 1980s. Named alluding to the movie Citizen Kane, the trio recorded for the record label Kitchenware, which was also home to Prefab Sprout. ==Career== Vocalists Martin Brammer (born 13 May 1957, Seaham, County Durham) and Paul Woods, with multi-instrumentalist Dave Brewis, formed the trio in 1982, after meeting while in small local bands, and signed to a small record label, which led to a deal with London Records in 1984. Their debut album, The Bad and Lowdown World of the Kane Gang (released in the US as Lowdown), was released the following year. It spawned two UK hit singles: \"Closest Thing to Heaven\" (No. 12) and a cover of The Staples Singers' \"Respect Yourself\" (No. 21). The latter was also a hit in Australia, reaching No. 19. The album was produced by Pete Wingfield, and featured P. P. Arnold and Sam Brown as backing vocalists. The band's next album, Miracle, was released in 1987 and spawned two US hit singles: \"Motortown\" (No. 36 US / No. 45 UK) and another cover \u2013 this time of Dennis Edwards' \"Don't Look Any Further\" (No. 64 US / No. 52 UK). The latter hit No. 1 on the US Dance Charts. Woods left the band in 1991 to attempt a solo career. Woods and Brewis also worked on an album which was never released. ==Other works== The Kane Gang performed the music for the \"Ooh Gary Davies... On Your Radio\" jingle for BBC Radio 1. As was the fashion around that time, bands would adapt songs to provide the radio station with a jingle, and embed the hook of the track in the public's consciousness. The Gary Davies jingle was based on their track \"Smalltown Creed\" (from the LP The Bad and Lowdown World of the Kane Gang). The same track was used as the basis for the theme tune of long-running Children's BBC television programme Byker Grove, which launched the careers of Ant & Dec (as PJ & Duncan) and Donna Air. ==Post-The Kane Gang== Brammer continues to write songs for other artists. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" |+ List of albums, with selected chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\" | Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | UK ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | AUS ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | US |- ! scope=\"row\" | The Bad and Lowdown World of the Kane Gang | * Released: March 1985 * Label: London Records (820215-1) | 21 || 65 || - |- ! scope=\"row\" | Miracle | * Released: March 1985 * Label: London Records (828057-1) | 41 ||82 || 115 |} ===Compilation albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" border=\"1\" !
