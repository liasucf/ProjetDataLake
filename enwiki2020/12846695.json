    "text": "Thomas McDonnell (1831 \u2013 8 November 1899) was a 19th-century New Zealand public servant, military leader and writer. Major Thomas McDonnell ==Biography== ===Childhood and early life=== McDonnell was born to Thomas McDonnell Sr., an early British merchant and speculator who served a brief term as Additional British Resident, and his wife Anna McDonnell (n\u00e9e Patterson). He was born between 1831 and 1833 and raised first in Sydney, then Horeke, Northland. There he learned to speak M\u0101ori and how to use the traditional taiaha weapon. He tried his luck on the Victorian goldfields from 1853 to 1855, then returned to New Zealand where he obtained a post in the Native Land Purchase Department under Alfred Domett in Auckland. After being paid eight months late, McDonnell resigned from that job and went sheepfarming in the Hawkes Bay with his brother William, only to be defrauded by a third party. He returned to Auckland in 1862 and was appointed interpreter to the resident magistrate at Thames, panning for gold on the side. ===New Zealand Wars=== Through Alfred Domett, McDonnell obtained a commission in the Colonial Defence Force as a sub-inspector in 1863. During this time McDonnell served in the Invasion of the Waikato, seeing action at the battles of Rangiaowhia and Hairini. He was promoted to Captain in 1864. ==== T\u012btokowaru's War ==== Following the end of the conflict in the Waikato, McDonnell took command of the colonial forces at Patea in 1866. McDonnell led a short and ruthless campaign against a number of Taranaki M\u0101ori villages, torching and destroying as he and his men went. ===Retirement from Military=== On 9 April 1870, McDonnell married Henrietta Elise Lomax, in Wellington. Together they had four children. He acquired \u00a3690 in government grants and \u00a31,400 worth of freehold property at Wanganui, and set up as a Native Land Court interpreter and land agent at Wanganui in 1884. He received the New Zealand Cross on 31 March 1886, and published fragmented memoirs, as well as a fanciful M\u0101ori history of the wars. ===Death=== Thomas McDonnell died on 8 November 1899. ==References== == Further reading == * Category:1831 births Category:1899 deaths Category:New Zealand military personnel Category:British colonial army officers Category:Military leaders of the New Zealand Wars Category:New Zealand farmers Category:Interpreters Category:Recipients of the New Zealand Cross (1869) Category:19th-century translators ",
