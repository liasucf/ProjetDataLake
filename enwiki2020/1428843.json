    "text": "The Star Trek canon is the set of all canonical material in the Star Trek universe. The official Star Trek website defines canon as comprising the television series and feature films of the franchise. ==Television series== As a rule, all Star Trek television series that aired are considered part of the canon. This policy does not make clear which version of the series is the canonical one. For example, the remastered episodes of the original series, released in 2006, present several visual differences from the episodes originally aired. ===Roddenberry's impact=== Gene Roddenberry was something of a revisionist when it came to canonicity. People who worked with Roddenberry remember that he used to handle canonicity not on a series-by-series basis nor an episode-by-episode basis, but point by point. If he changed his mind on something, or if a fact in one episode contradicted what he considered to be a more important fact in another episode, he had no problem declaring that specific point not canonical. Additionally, David Gerrold, in an interview about Star Trek: The Animated Series, commented on Roddenberry's parsimony and how it originally affected the Star Treks canon: ===From non-canon to canon=== Occasionally, writers will draw from non-canonical works in creating new canon. Such is the case of the first names for Hikaru Sulu and Nyota Uhura, which were first used in the novel The Entropy Effect and the reference book Star Trek II Biographies, respectively. Several concepts that first appeared in The Animated Series, which was considered to be non-canon for a couple of decades (1980s-2000s),\"Do you think the Animated series should be considered canon? Or even more so, IS the Animated Series canon?\" \"We don't consider it canon, but it's kinda cool to throw in the odd reference here and there.\" - Ronald D. Moore, AOL's \"Ask Ron D. Moore\" message board, October 1998.The Animated Series Gets Real at the official Star Trek website.

URL retrieved June 16, 2007. ===Unreadable text=== One final issue comes from text that appears on props such as computer displays, but is not legible during the episode, except in modern HDTV broadcasts. The transcript of the text can often be obtained through behind-the-scenes pictures and interviews. This leads to the question of whether material that is in the episodes but cannot be seen clearly should be considered canon. Often, this material tends to be inside jokes inserted by the production staff. Other kinds of information, such as the biographical information seen on a computer display in the Enterprise episode \"In a Mirror, Darkly\", has been stated to not be \"hard canon\".\"I wouldn't really consider any of this 'hard canon,' so take it all with a grain of salt. Both bios were slapped together hastily and weren't approved by the exec producers.\" - Mike Sussman, Enterprise Producer, TrekBBS posts, April 30, 2005. ==Films== All official Star Trek feature films are also considered canonical. While not explicitly stated, the most complete released version of the films, including scenes missing from the theatrical version of a film but included in home releases or director's cuts, appear to be canonical. One scene, deleted from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, revealed Peter Preston as the nephew of Scotty.\"The \"Director's Edition\" version of the film is not substantively longer than the original theatrical release, as he pointed out during last week's gala premiere at Paramount. But there were certain short scenes that Meyer felt needed to be restored. A couple of those scenes involve Midshipman Peter Preston in Engineering, with dialog establishing Preston as Scotty's nephew (\"my sister's youngest\").\" Spotlight: Meyer Speaks Proudly of \"Khan\" article at the official Star Trek website.

Adding confusion to the issue is the fact that Roddenberry is quoted as saying he disliked the films, and \"didn't much consider them canon\". There exists no definitive list of which films in particular Roddenberry disliked, or what elements in them he did not consider canonical. For example, the reference book Star Trek Chronology states that Roddenberry considered elements of Star Trek V and Star Trek VI to be apocryphal, but it does not specify which particular elements in the films Roddenberry objected to. The canonicity of extra features found on home DVD releases, such as deleted scenes, has never been explicitly addressed. ===\"Reboot\" films (Kelvin Timeline)=== Star Trek (the 2009 film), Into Darkness and Beyond occur in a separate timeline from the rest of the series. In June 2016, for the computer game Star Trek Online, CBS has named this the Kelvin Timeline, named after the USS Kelvin which was attacked and destroyed in the opening scene of Star Trek. Former names for this universe have included the alternate timeline and the reboot series. ==Publications== ===Original tie-in novels=== Many of the original novels published by Pocket Books are not considered part of the canon. This was a guideline set early on by Gene Roddenberry, and repeated many times by people who worked with him. > And as long as Gene Roddenberry is involved in it, he is the final word on > what is Star Trek. So, for us here \u2013 Ron Moore, Jeri Taylor, everybody who > works on the show \u2013 Gene is the authority.

Two Voyager novels written by Jeri Taylor (co-creator and then producer of Voyager), Mosaic and Pathways, were written early on in Voyagers run and detailed the background of the series' main characters. These were meant to be canon, and to be used as references by the series' writers when fleshing out the characters. These two novels are sometimes named as exceptions to the \"no book is canon\" rule.\"Only the reference books (tech manual, encyclopedia, etc...) and two books by Jeri Taylor are considered canon outside the TV show and movies.\" - Harry Lang, Senior Director of Viacom Consumer Products Interactive division, posts on StarTrek.com forum, January 2005. However, as some of the background information mentioned in those books was never referenced in an episode of Voyager, or was contradicted in episodes written after they were published, their status as canon is still open to debate. ===Novelizations=== The novelizations of episodes and movies are not considered canon. This is a tradition that also goes back to Roddenberry himself. His novelization of Star Trek: The Motion Picture includes many tangents and new information. It reveals, for instance, that the woman who dies in the transporter accident was Kirk's former spouse. While this novel filled in many gaps left in the movie, Roddenberry is quoted as saying it should not be considered canon.\"The novelization that Gene wrote himself, of Star Trek: the Motion Picture, he does not consider canon either, because he also went off on tangents, that he said that it's okay for individual writers to do that, and he certainly had some fun with it himself, filling in parts of the puzzle that he never would've been able to do on film, it would've been a ten-hour movie, but he doesn't want even that used for canon, because otherwise, where do you draw the line? Which books are accepted and which aren't?\" - Richard Arnold, Star Trek: The Next Generation research consultant and Star Trek archivist, 1991 interview with Tim Lynch. ===Reference books=== There are conflicting messages concerning \"non-fiction\" reference books such as The Star Trek Encyclopedia, Star Trek Chronology, Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Technical Manual. Unlike the novels and novelizations, these reference manuals have never been explicitly named as non-canon, and the fact that they were officially sanctioned by Paramount and given to episode writers as guides serves to give them an aura of credibility. Roddenberry himself considered it part of the \"background\" of Star Trek.\"Documents such as this Technical Manual help give some background to the vision we work so hard to create on Star Trek. Rick and Mike have obviously had a lot of fun filling in the gaps and trying to find technical 'explanations' for some of our mistakes.\" - Gene Roddenberry, Introduction to the Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual Meanwhile, Michael Okuda and Rick Sternbach, artists and technical consultants since Star Trek: The Next Generation and the authors of several of these reference books, considered their work \"pretty official\".\"How 'official' is this stuff? Well, this is the first technical manual done by folks who actually work on Star Trek. It's closely based on source material we've developed in conjunction with our writers and producers in our role as technical consultants for the series. In that sense it can be considered pretty 'official'.\" - Mike Okuda and Rick Sternbach, Introduction to the Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual However, they stop short of naming the books canon, leaving the debate open. Star Trek writer and co-producer Ronald D. Moore dismisses such official material as \"speculation\", and says that the writing staff did not consider it canon.\"You have to remember that things like CD-ROMs and the various \"official\" manuals put out by Paramount are not done in conjunction with the writing/producing staffs and that the authors are usually simply extrapolating information based on what's actually been seen on screen.\" - Ronald D. Moore, AOL's \"Ask Ron D. Moore\" message board, July 1998\"We do use things like the Encyclopedia, the Chronology, the Technical Manual etc. for reference, but unless it was explicitly mentioned on screen, we won't feel bound by anything stated even in those books.\" - Ronald D. Moore, Star Trek Continuum message board posting, September 1998. However, CBS Corporation, the parent company of Paramount, seems to believe differently. In a series of posts to the official Star Trek website's forums, Viacom Senior Director Harry Lang left no doubt that he considers the reference books as canon.\"The tech manuals are written by ST production staff, same as the Encyclopedia (Mike Okuda). Since their contents report on what is canon, they are technically canon.\" - Harry Lang, Senior Director of Viacom Consumer Products Interactive division, posts on StarTrek.com forum, January 2005. ===Other publications=== Star Trek comic books and magazines are generally not considered part of the canon. Regarding IDW Publishing's comic book tie-ins to the 2009 film and its sequel, screenwriter Roberto Orci felt that the background information conveyed in those books could be considered canonically accurate. Using rules similar to the ones that governed Star Wars canon at the time, he acknowledged that the extended universe material he oversees could remain part of the accepted canon unless contradicted by future films or television series.Exclusive: Orci Says Star Trek TV Talks Getting Real + Declares Movie Tie-in Comics & Game As Canon. TrekMovie. Retrieved on May 10, 2014. ==Other material== Nothing that takes place in Star Trek games, the Star Trek: The Experience attraction, Star Trek fan productions or Trekdom is considered part of the canon. ===Roddenberry-approved material=== Based on the amount of creative control Roddenberry exerted over the first seasons of Star Trek, some people argue that only Roddenberry-approved material should be considered canonical.\"Gene rewrote virtually every Star Trek script for the first two seasons, often working around the clock, days at a time, to produce scripts that conformed to his view of what Star Trek was and could be. It was not unusual for Gene to be walking out of the studio in the morning as the actors were arriving. As Gene used to say, 'It isn\u2019t Star Trek until I say it\u2019s Star Trek.' This ability to synthesize and improve input from others, adding his own special insights and touches, is best illustrated in the famous opening that set the tone for the series.\" - David Alexander, Star Trek Creator: The Authorized Biography of Gene Roddenberry, 1994. Such an approach would eliminate from the canon anything Roddenberry disliked, as well as everything made after his death, including seven movies and multiple television series. However, Roddenberry himself preemptively rebuked such an attitude. He had hoped that Star Trek would go on after his death.\"I would hope there are bright young people, growing up all the time, who will bring to [Star Trek] levels and areas that were beyond me, and I don't feel jealous about that at all. [...] It'll go on, without any of us, and get better and better and better, because that's the... that really is the human condition. It's to improve and improve.\" - Gene Roddenberry, The Star Trek Saga: From One Generation to the Next, 1988. As Star Trek was constantly improved by each following generation, he expected people to look back upon its humble beginnings as just that, the simple beginnings of something much bigger and better.\"There's a good chance that when I'm gone, others will come along and do so well that people will say, 'Oh, that Roddenberry. He was never this good.' But I will be pleased with that statement.\" - Gene Roddenberry, Los Angeles Times TV Times, article \"Star Treks New Frontier\", 1993. Roddenberry clearly never intended Star Trek to be limited to his work, but to include all the hopefully superior work of future generations. === Klingon language === The Klingon language was first conceived by James Doohan for the movie Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and consisted only of a few words. Later, Marc Okrand proceeded to flesh out the sparse vocabulary into a real language, complete with grammar rules and phonology, and went so far as to publish The Klingon Dictionary (1985, revised edition 1992); the Klingon Language Institute was created soon thereafter.About the Klingon Language article at the Klingon Language Institute. URL retrieved December 5, 2006. Okrand's Klingon language was used to write the Klingon dialogues heard in several Star Trek movies and episodes.Marc Okrand short bio at StarTrek.com, the official Star Trek website. URL retrieved December 5, 2006. Okrand has developed the language in an important way in two audio- courses: Conversational Klingon (1992) and Power Klingon (1993), and in two books: The Klingon Way (1996) and Klingon for the Galactic Traveller (1997). Despite these facts, however, Ronald D. Moore stated in 1997: \"Whether or not [Trek writers] use the language as spelled out in Marc's dictionary is up to the individual writer,\" and that he \"find[s] the dictionary cumbersome and usually find[s] it easier to make [the language] up phonetically.\" Ron D.
