    "text": "Estonia was represented by Tanel Padar, Dave Benton and 2XL, with the song '\"Everybody\", at the 2001 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 12 May in Copenhagen. \"Everybody\" was chosen as the Estonian entry at the national final, Eurolaul, on 3 February. \"Everybody\" went on to bring Estonia one of the most unexpected victories in Eurovision history. It is also historic for representing the first Eurovision victory by one of the \"new\" nations - the considerable number of countries which had joined Eurovision post-1992 - and also for Benton becoming the first (and to date only) black performer to win a Eurovision title. ==Before Eurovision== === Eurolaul 2001 === The final was held at the studios of broadcaster ETV in Tallinn, hosted by Marko Reikop and Elektra. Eight songs took part with the winner being chosen by an \"expert\" international jury. All songs were presented in English for the first time.ESC National Finals database 2001 {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center\" |+ style=\"font-size: bigger;\" | ! colspan=\"6\" |Final \u2013 3 February 2001 |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" !

Pre-contest betting had rated Greece as the favourite for victory, with Denmark, France, Slovenia and Sweden also in the frame and Estonia nowhere in sight. The first half of the voting was very tight, and after 12 juries Denmark was in the lead on 99 points, with Estonia and France on 92 and 90 respectively. However, from that point Estonia quickly pulled away and at the close of voting \"Everybody\" had received 198 points and become a very surprising winner by a clear margin of 21 points over eventual runners-up Denmark. The song had received nine maximum 12s - from Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovenia, Turkey and the United Kingdom - with only one country (Portugal) failing to award it any points at all. The 12 points from the Estonian televote were awarded to Denmark.ESC History - Estonia 2001 ===Points awarded to Estonia=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |+Points awarded to Estonia |- !width=20%|12 points !width=20%|10 points !width=20%|8 points !width=20%|7 points !width=20%|6 points |- | valign=\"top\" | * * * * * * * * * | valign=\"top\" | * * * * | valign=\"top\" | * * * * | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | * * |- !width=20%|5 points !width=20%|4 points !width=20%|3 points !width=20%|2 points !width=20%|1 point |- | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | |} ===Points awarded by Estonia=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"gold\"|12 points|| |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"silver\"|10 points|| |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"#CC9966\"|8 points|| |- |width=20%|7 points|| |- |width=20%|6 points|| |- |width=20%|5 points|| |- |width=20%|4 points|| |- |width=20%|3 points|| |- |width=20%|2 points|| |- |width=20%|1 point|| |- |} ==See also== *Estonia in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 2001 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 2001 Category:Estonia in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:2001 in Estonia ",
