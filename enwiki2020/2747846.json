The 'big' three of the 1960s were Belgium, Netherlands, West Germany and Switzerland was the emerging ETF Nation. The four UK Home Nations England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Irland and Eire, as well as from southern Europe Malta and Gibraltar travelled to London. The Americas were represented through the US and Asia through Israel, which reached against all odds the Semi-Final stage. Stuart Goldman(\u2020) was UK citizen from England and represented Israel. The 24 players were drawn in the 6 groups of 4 players and the 2 top players of each group proceeded to the 2nd group stage, with 4 groups of 3 players. The top 2 players again emerged then to the Quarter-Finales. All results are in the FISTF archive. We can see that Subbuteo was innovative with the tournament modus in 1970. The FIFA World Cup 1982 was played with this modus, without the Q/F stage. The World Cup 1970 Quarter- and Semi-Finals {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Player !! Nation !! Result !! Player !!

The 7th Edition in 1994 (host Nation was the USA) was the last edition under the Patronance of FISA (Waddingtons Sports Games Ltd.). The organization was already well under way in 1992\u20131993 and the event was finally played, in Chicago. The first FISTF Sports World Championship was played in Paris (Fra) 1994. In 1993, two European champions reigned (ETF and FISTF), 1994 two world champions reigned (FISA and FISTF) and in 1996 a FISA Subbuteo European Championship and the FISTF World Championship was played. After 1996 there were no more double events played and FISTF strengthened its position as the global sports table football federation. The junior (U-16) World Cup was played in 1978 for the first time with three new Nations present, such as Austria, Greece and Canada. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |+ FISA Subbuteo World Cup \u2013 Senior |- !

The nation winning the most individual matches, won the team match. A draw was also possible, if each team won an individual match and the third match would be a draw itself. The result would be a 1\u20131; as an example. Starting with 1984, the European Championship was played with the same structure as the FISA World Cup, containing one Senior and one Junior category. In 1996 another FISA Subbuteo European Championship event was organized, although FISTF had already been established in 1992. Several nations (Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, Netherlands, Cyprus, Norway) were not invited or did not participate, and the reason is unclear. After 1993, with all nations joining FISTF, the ETF (ESTF 1992\u201393) became defunct in October 1993. Hasbro (took over Waddington Sports Games Ltd. with Subbuteo brand name in 1995\u20131996), tried to carry on by itself to organize a FISA event, with a limited number of players participating. The 1996 competition was therefore the very last organized by FISA (Hasbro). All matches played were 2x15min, with extra time of 2x5min in necessary, and 5x shots in the knock out phase. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |+ FISA Subbuteo European Championship \u2013 Team 1x Senior and 2x Junior (U-16) |- !

Which was then an indicator for the upcoming FISTF as the new world federation. The ETF founded in 1963, defunct after the 30th Edition of the Europa Cup in 1993. It was a strong and stable association and the base for the merger of ETF Nations (associations) and FISA Nations (associations), to form and built FISTF. Some countries had two (2) table football/soccer/Subbuteo associations each affiliated to ETF or FISA. That took time to meld together. The main problems where the playing rules and equipment manufactured. FISTF made a new start to melt all players into one democratic global federation, with sport rules and material with several manufacturers offering sports equipment. The development of FISTF is ongoing and more Nations around the Globe are joining. All ETF matches played 2x20min., a.e.t.=after extra time with 2x10min, if necessary 1x10min. golden goal decision or 5x shots (similar to penalties in football but taken from different positions just inside the shooting area). Corrections: Willi Hogeweg was German, and not Dutch. Kurt Erb won the 1980 Europa Cup in Uddingston (SCO), and not his brother Peter Erb. Both mistakes corrected, which were previously mentioned. Tonio Montesin (Malta) was the finalist in the 1993 ESTF Cup final, and not John Barrons (NIL)! Important to mention is that Mike Dent is Scottish, while playing for England in 1976. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |+ E.T.F. Europa Cup (Individual) |- ! Year ! Host City ! Winner ! Finalist !

The three ETF Members Belgium, Netherlands and Germany participated. England, the fourth ETF Member did not participate. In the 1960s 2 points were given for win and 1 point for a draw, that's why a high score of 8\u20130 was possible, which meant a 4\u20130 win in today's result system. Starting with the 1983 ETF Nations Cup, the one (1) point system was introduced for an individual win and for a draw non-points were given to both teams. A team consisted of four (4) Players. All ETF Matches were played 2x20min. In knock-out Stages, an 'after extra time' (a.e.t.) with 2x10min was applied if the match had a draw result. In case there was no winner, the 'golden goal' had to be scored in a 1x10min period. If no winner came up, the 5 shot system was used. The 5 shot system is practically the penalty shooting in real football/soccer. The Editions 1969\u201370 and 1970\u201371 were cancelled due to the fact that the Netherlands were not interested to participate at the ETF Nations Cup. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ E.T.F.

At the 1st edition in Spa (BEL), Clubs participated from Belgium (ETF), France (FISA), Germany (ETF) and the Netherlands (ETF). Italian clubs (FISA) participated at the 2nd edition. The 2nd edition in Aubervilliers (FRA) was played on the weekend 9\u201310 January 1988 (Season 87\u201388) with 4 countries, France (7), Belgium (5), Italy (2) and Germany (1) with a total of 15 clubs. The 3rd edition in Oldham (ENG) on 4\u20135 August 1990 (Season 89\u201390) with 7 countries, France, Belgium, Italy, Wales, England and Netherlands. The 7th nation (Germany, Scotland or other) is not yet confirmed from research work. The Quarter-Finals 1989\u201390: Cardiff TSL 2\u20130 SC Elbeuf, SC Goldfingers Cornesse 3\u20130 Charlton SC, Birmingham TSL 2\u20130 Leicester Cheetah SC, RSMV Rotterdam 2\u20131 Florence SC. The editions in 1985\u201386 and 1987\u201388 were an initiative by the clubs and players (FISA and ETF), as well as the FBFTS and FFFT . The edition in 1989\u201390 was organized by FISA personal. The Europa Cup for ((Club Teams)) of Sport Table Football was finally born. The club Teams consisted of three players each. The club winning the most of the three matches wins. The playing time was 2x20 minutes (ETF) with three (3) players (FISA) per team. The single win per player counted 1 point, the draw 0 points for each team and the loss 0 points, and therefore it was often important, to have a good goal difference scored from the three individual matches. Clubs participated from FISA and ETF countries, and the Europa Cup for Club Teams began too emerge steadily. It was the beginning, when the flicking nations from FISA and ETF, came step by step together. Talks and meetings, ideas and projects came up to get the table football community merged. The BIG Ignition sparkled! {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Europa Cup for Club Teams (ETF and FISA clubs) |- ! Year !

FISTF. British Home Championship== Update: The British Home Nation Tournament from 1973 was added, found in a private archive. The edition counting will be revised. The 13th (14th) edition was played in 1986. The information are mentioned in the Table Soccer Review of the ETSA. Mainly England, Scotland and Wales participated, with Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland (EIRE, ROI) participating in several editions. In 1976, England won their 5th Home Championship, therefore the Edition numbers need corrections. Research goes on through old copies of \"The blue\" magazine. England won the first seven (eight!) editions. Wales humbled England in 1981. 1982\u20131986 England won again five editions in a row. The 14th (15th) edition has not been found yet. Research work ongoing. The first ever International match (National Teams) was played in Bruxelles (BEL) 7 February 1960, between Belgium and the Netherlands. Belgium won! The foundation of an international federation was in line. All started with an International match in England, Tunbridge Wells, Kent. This 2nd International match between two Nations was played in Tunbridge Wells, Oct./Nov. 1960, England against Belgium, on behalf of an invitation for three players from Mr. Peter Adolph. Earlier in February 1960 the 1st International Match was played between Belgium and the Netherlands. After that, more International matches between sports table football associations have been played.
