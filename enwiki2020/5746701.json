    "text": "In Norse mythology, Hamskerpir and Gar\u00f0rofa are a pair of horses who sired H\u00f3fvarpnir, the horse ridden by the goddess Gn\u00e1. Hamskerpir and Gar\u00f0rofa are attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. ==Attestations== In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, High provides brief descriptions of 16 \u00e1synjur. High lists Gn\u00e1 thirteenth, and in his description provides a stanza that gives Gn\u00e1's horse H\u00f3fvarpnir's parents as Hamsker\u00f0ir and Gar\u00f0rofa: > :\"I fly not :though I fare :and move through the air :on Hofvarpnir :the one > whom Hamskerpir got :with Gardrofa.\"Byock (2005:44). ==Theories== John Lindow says that the name Hamskerpir does not have an obvious meaning, but that Gar\u00f0rofa may mean \"fence breaker.\" Lindow adds that two horses are otherwise unknown from any other source, and that the myths surrounding them have not survived.Lindow (147:2001). ==Notes== ==References== * Byock, Jesse (Trans.)
