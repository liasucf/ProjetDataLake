    "text": "The 1972 United States presidential election in Georgia took place on November 7, 1972, as part of the 1972 United States presidential election. Georgia voters chose 12 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Georgia was won by incumbent President Richard Nixon (R\u2013California), with 75.04% of the popular vote, against George McGovern (D\u2013South Dakota), with 24.65% of the popular vote. This made Georgia, even amidst a Republican landslide, 26% more Republican than the nation at- large and made it Nixon's second strongest state in the 1972 election. Although Mississippi was to give Nixon an even larger margin, in the 11 subsequent presidential elections only 1 statewide result \u2013 Ronald Reagan\u2019s victory in Utah in 1980 \u2013 has provided so large a margin. This is also the best showing in the state by a Republican presidential candidate, as not even Ronald Reagan would win the state popular vote by 70%. In the South, McGovern was universally viewed as a left-wing extremist because of his support for busing and civil rights, plus his opposition to the Vietnam War, support for granting amnesty to draft dodgersPerry, James Moorhead; Us and Them: How the Press Covered the 1972 Election, p. 136 and support for a $1,000 giveaway to each American as a solution to poverty.Grantham, Dewey W.; The Life and Death of the Solid South: A Political History, p. 179 Many, especially Republican campaigners, also believed McGovern would legalize abortion and illicit drugs if he were electedDavis, Lanny; Scandal: How \"Gotcha\" Politics Is Destroying America, pp. 65-66 \u2013 despite the fact that his running mate Sargent Shriver was firmly pro-life. In a state that would reflect McGovern's national results, the Democratic nominee did not win a single county in Georgia. Despite overwhelming Democratic dominance of the state for over a century, owing to the Republican leanings of several pro-Union North Georgia counties, chiefly Fannin but also Towns and Pickens, this was the first time any candidate had swept every Georgia county.Thomas, G. Scott; The Pursuit of the White House: A Handbook of Presidential Election Statistics and History, p. 425 Even more unusual, every county in the state would go on to vote for the Democratic candidate, Jimmy Carter, in the next presidential election. The 1972 election constitutes the only time Fulton CountyThe Political Graveyard; Fulton County, Georgia (home of Atlanta) and Hancock CountyThe Political Graveyard; Hancock County, Georgia have not voted Democrat since at least 1880. It is the last time the following counties have ever voted Republican: Calhoun, Clay, Macon, Stewart, Talbot, Taliaferro, and Warren.Sullivan, Robert David; \u2018How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over
