    "text": "is a S\u014dt\u014d Zen Buddhist temple located in the city of Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan. Its main image is a statue of Shaka Ny\u014drai, although the temple is more famous for its statues of the 500 Rakan. The temple was built at the seat of the Nanbu clan in Sannohe by the 13th chieftain of the clan, Nambu Moriyuki, in 1394. In 1601, the Nanbu clan was ordered to relocate its seat south to Morioka Castle by the Tokugawa shogunate, and the 27th chieftain (and first daimy\u014d of Morioka Domain), Nanbu Toshinao relocated the temple at that time. During the Edo period, the temple was a seminary and was the head temple of a network of 280 temples throughout the Nanbu domains. In 1869, the kar\u014d of Morioka Domain, Narayama Sado, committed seppuku within the Hond\u014d of the temple at the time of the collapse of the \u014cuetsu Reppan D\u014dmei during the Boshin War of the Meiji restoration. A notable feature of the temple is the Rakan-d\u014d, built in 1735 and rebuilt in 1858. Its central statue Rushana butsu is reported to be made by K\u014db\u014d-daishi. Within the Rakan-d\u014d are statues of the 500 Rakan, which were made in Kyoto and later brought to Morioka. Included are representations of Kublai Khan and Marco Polo.Morioka City home page ==Gallery== File:171104 Hoonji Morioka Iwate pref Japan08n.jpg|Hond\u014d File:171104 Hoonji Morioka Iwate pref Japan12n.jpg|Rakan-d\u014d File:ArhatsMorioka.JPG|500 Rakan File:171104 Hoonji Morioka Iwate pref Japan15n.jpg|Precinct ==External links== *Visit Iwate *Japan Travel ==References== Category:Buddhist temples in Iwate Prefecture Category:Morioka, Iwate Category:Soto temples Category:1390s establishments in Japan ",
