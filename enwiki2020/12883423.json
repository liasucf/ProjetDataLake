    "text": "Normal Life is a 1996 American crime drama film based on the real lives of husband-and-wife bank robbers, Jeffrey and Jill Erickson. The film stars Ashley Judd and Luke Perry and was directed by John McNaughton. The original screenplay was written by husband-and-wife team Peg Haller and Bob Schneider. == Plot == Chris (Luke Perry), a young police officer meets the attractive and sexy Pamela (Ashley Judd) and immediately falls in love with her. Even her drug and alcohol problems cannot affect his mad love for her and they decide to marry. As the relationship continues, more problems arise. Their passionate love is accompanied by destructive fights and Pam's emotional problems start to surface. She shows no respect for Chris\u2019s family members who are very important to him. Pam's also manipulative and exploits Chris\u2019s love for her, leaving him to do all the chores and making him buy her expensive things until they are on the brink of bankruptcy. Trouble escalates when Chris loses his job after trouble with a fellow officer. To finance Pam's lifestyle, Chris decides to earn a living by robbing banks. Pam's fascinated with his bank heists and begs him to tag along. After having finally robbed enough banks to afford a house of their own, Chris decides to stop a life of crime, much to Pam's chagrin. Pam soon leaves Chris who quickly finds himself unable to live without her. Chris then agrees to start robbing banks again, which proves to be fatal for the duo. == Cast == * Ashley Judd as Pam Anderson * Luke Perry as Chris Anderson * Bruce A. Young as Agent Parker * Jim True-Frost as Mike Anderson * Penelope Milford as Adele Anderson * Edmund Wyson as Darren * Kate Walsh as Cindy Anderson * Tom Towles as Frank Anderson == Production == Producer Steven A. Jones read an article about Jeffrey Erickson, a suspected bank robber whose wife Jill led the Federal Bureau of Investigation on a chase through 12 different suburbs, with a machine gun hanging out of the window of her van, when they came to capture him, which led to a huge gun battle. She ended up dead, ostensibly taking her own life after she was wounded. He read another article related to the case in the New York Times, and, knowing the author of the articles, tried unsuccessfully to contact him. The rights to the story had already been purchased by someone else, but coincidentally Jones received a screenplay about the couple from the husband-and-wife screenwriting team of Peg Haller and Bob Schneider and producer Richard Maynard, and they agreed to work together. The William Morris talent agency said Luke Perry was interested in the lead role, and they also suggested Ashley Judd for the female lead. Perry was well known for the television series Beverly Hills, 90210 and Spelling Entertainment were willing to put up the money to make the film. The distributor New Line Cinema were optimistic about the film at first. However, test audiences were not expecting a crime drama, instead they expected a Luke Perry movie to be similar to 90210 and reacted negatively. New Line declined to release the film. After director John McNaughton complained in the press, they gave the film a limited release for a week in New York and Los Angeles, and then the film went to HBO. == Reception == On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 70% based on 10 reviews. James Berardinelli in his article on reelviews.net: \"Luke Perry, giving the most convincing performance of his career to date, makes it clear how desperately, hopelessly smitten Chris is by his wild, troubled wife.\" And finally: \"By depicting the sham of 'normality,' Normal Life reminds us how fictitious and unattainable the 'American dream' can be.\" Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 out of 4, called the film \"fascinating in its portrait of criminal pathology\" and praised the casting. Peter Sobczynski writes in an article titled \"A Good Ashley Judd Film? Believe It or Not!\": \"[...] her single greatest performance-indeed, one of the strongest bits of film acting that you are ever likely to see-was in what probably remains the most obscure and least-seen film of her career, John McNaughton's 1996 masterpiece Normal Life.\" ==Home media== The film was released to DVD in February 2005. == References == == External links == * * * * * American Humane Category:1996 films Category:1990s crime thriller films Category:1990s heist films Category:1996 independent films Category:American films Category:American heist films Category:American independent films Category:Crime films based on actual events Category:English-language films Category:Films about bank robbery Category:Films directed by John McNaughton Category:Films shot in Illinois ",
