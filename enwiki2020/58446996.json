    "text": "Aspergillus novofumigatus is a species of fungus in the genus Aspergillus. It is from the Fumigati section. Several fungi from this section produce heat- resistant ascospores, and the isolates from this section are frequently obtained from locations where natural fires have previously occurred. The species was first described in 2006.Hong, S.-B.; Go, S.-J.; Shin, H.-D.; Frisvad, J.C.; Samson, R.A. 2005. Polyphasic taxonomy of Aspergillus fumigatus and related species. Mycologia. 97(6):1316-1329 It was isolated from soil from the Galapagos Islands. It has been shown to produce aszonalenin, cycloechinuline, fiscalins, helvolic acid, neosartorin, palitantin, terrein, and territrem B. In 2014, the genome of A. novofumigatus was sequenced as a part of the Aspergillus whole-genome sequencing project - a project dedicated to performing whole-genome sequencing of all members of the genus Aspergillus.Kjaerbolling I, Vesth TC, Frisvad JC, Nybo JL, Theobald S, Kuo A, Bowyer P, Matsuda Y, Mondo S, Lyhne EK, Kogle ME, Clum A, Lipzen A, Salamov A, Ngan CY, Daum C, Chiniquy J, Barry K, LaButti K, Haridas S, Simmons BA, Magnuson JK, Mortensen UH, Larsen TO, Grigoriev IV, Baker SE, Andersen MR Linking secondary metabolites to gene clusters through genome sequencing of six diverse Aspergillus species.
