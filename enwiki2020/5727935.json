It ran for 38 episodes, from October 4, 2000 to June 27, 2001, on the TV Tokyo network and its affiliates. ==Overview== Gear Fighter Dendoh tells the story of two Japanese schoolboys\u2014short-tempered Ginga Izumo and level-headed Hokuto Kusanagi\u2014who meet each other one day, only a few minutes before the Earth is attacked by Galfa (sometimes translated as Gulfer or Garufa), a race of sentient machines determined to wipe out all life in the universe. In the midst of this chaos, the two are chosen by Dendoh, a giant robot built to battle Galfa, to be its pilots, causing them to become members of the Guard Earth and Advanced Reconnaissance organization designated with the protection of Earth from the Galfa advance. The two young pilots find themselves in a race to obtain the powerful and animal-like Data Weapons before Galfa can get their hands on them. The show is directed and plotted by Mitsuo Fukuda and his wife, Chiaki Morosawa, the duo who went on to create Mobile Suit Gundam SEED and its sequel Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny. Notably, Morosawa was not sole head scriptwriter for Dendoh, instead sharing duties with Yasuko Kobayashi, who went on to be the head writer for Toei's Kamen Rider Ryuki, Kamen Rider Den-O, and Samurai Sentai Shinkenger. ==Cast and crew== ===Cast=== *Hokuto Kusanagi: Naomi Shind\u014d *Ginga Izumo: Y\u014dko Matsuoka *Vega/Orie Kusanagi, Story Narrator: Kotono Mitsuishi *Altair the Black Knight: Kazuhiro Nakata *Susumu Kirakuni, Abzolute: Kenji Nojima *Eris Williamette: Tomoko Ishimura *Gurumet, Keisuke Kusanagi, Meteor: Kazuya Ichij\u014d *Otome Izumo: Michiko Neya *Shibuya: Tomomichi Nishimura *Subaru: Kenichi Suzumura *Dr. Inoue, Witter: Yasuhiro Takato *Zero, Galfa Emperor, Gen'ichi Izumo: Sh\u014d Hayami ===Crew=== *Director: Mitsuo Fukuda *Series Composition: Chiaki Morosawa *Screenplay: Sukehiro Tomita (ep. 1\u20132); Masaharu Amiya (ep. 3, 7, 9, 25, 28); Hiroyuki Yoshino (screenwriter) (ep. 4, 8, 10, 14, 18, 19, 26, 30, 31, 37); Yasuko Kobayashi (ep. 5, 6, 11, 16, 21, 27); Chiaki Morosawa (ep. 12, 13, 23, 38); Shoji Tonoike (ep. 15, 17, 22, 24, 29, 33); Tomoya Asano (ep. 32, 35); Noboru Kimura (ep. 34, 36) *Storyboard: Eiji Yamanaka; Goro Taniguchi ;Keisaku Asuka; Manabu Ono; Masahiro Hosoda; Masakazu Obara; Masamitsu Hidaka; Mitsuo Fukuda; Naoki Hishikawa; Shigeki Takagi; Susumu Yamaguchi; Takashi Kawashima; Tetsuya Watanabe; Yasuhiro Minami; Yuu Kou *Episode Director: Hiroshi Kawashima; Manabu Ono; Masahiro Hosoda; Masahiro Takada; Masakazu Obara; Mitsuo Fukuda; Naoki Hishikawa; Shigeki Takagi; Shigenori Awai; Tetsuya Watanabe; Yasuhiro Minami *Animation director: Akira Takahashi; Eiji Nakata (Mecha); Hirokazu Hisayuki (Character); Manabu Imura (Mecha); Minoru Yamazawa; Satoshi Shishido (Mecha); Susumu Yamaguchi; Takehiro Suzuki; Takuro Shinbo (Character); Tamotsu Ikeda (Mecha); Yasutoshi Niwa;Yuji Ushijima (Character) *Character Designs: Hirokazu Hisayuki *Mechanical Designs: Junichi Akutsu *Music: Toshihiko Sahashi == Gear Machines == === === *Spec **Height 24.5 meters **Weight 399.8 tons === === *Spec **Height 28.5 meters **weight 401.0 tons === Unicorn Drill === *Spec **Height 23.0 meters === Viper Whip === *Spec **Height 58.0 meters === Leo Circle === *Spec **Height 15.0 meters === Bull Horn === *Spec **Height 16.0 meters === Dragon Flare === *Spec **Height 27.0 meters === Gatling Boar === *Spec **Height 12.0 meters === Chojuuoh Kiba === *Spec **Height 17.4 meters === Phoenix Alae === *Spec **Height 20.4 meters ==Galfa Empire== Seventeen years before the events of the series, Emperor Galfa was a biological manager program from planet Alktos that sought to destroy human life due to how they can and have easily destroyed nature.
