The club has previously played in the Cork Athletic Union League. They have also entered teams in the FAI Cup, the FAI Intermediate Cup, the FAI Youth Cup and the Munster Senior Cup ==History== Tramore Athletic F.C. was formed in 1948 following a split within Evergreen United. This split resulted in the majority of the youth players breaking away from Evergreen to form Tramore Athletic. The club was founded following a meeting at the O'Connell's Corner House Pub in Turners Cross. Its founding members came from Turners Cross, Douglas and Blackrock and as a result it took its name from the Tramore River which passed through the three communities. The club started out as a schoolboy club and shortly after its formation, Tramore Athletic became founding members of the Cork Schoolboys League. They won their first ever trophy in 1954 after winning an under\u201314 league title. Tramore Athletic also joined the Cork Athletic Union League and in 1956\u201357 and 1957\u201358 won the leagues third level and second level division titles in successive seasons. 1957\u201358 also saw the club come to national prominence for the first time when they won the FAI Youth Cup after defeating Johnville 2\u20130 in the final at Turners Cross. Encouraged by this national success Tramore Athletic entered a team in the Munster Senior League for the first time in 1959. Over subsequent decades Tramore Athletic enjoyed success at both provincial and national levels, winning four Munster Senior League Senior Premier Division titles and contesting seven FAI Intermediate Cup finals. They have also won the FAI Youth Cup on two further occasions. Dave Barry and Kieran O'Regan both featured in the side which beat Home Farm in 1979\u201380. O'Regan also scored in the 3\u20130 win over Athlone Town in 1981\u201382. In addition to regularly competing in the FAI Youth Cup and FAI Intermediate Cup, Tramore Athletic have also occasionally competed in the FAI Cup. ==Notable former players== ;Republic of Ireland international * Kieran O'Regan ;Republic of Ireland U23 international * Graham Cummins ;League of Ireland XI representatives * Dave Barry * Donal Leahy ;League of Ireland manager * Noel O'Mahony ;Cork inter-county Gaelic footballers * Dave Barry * Derek Kavanagh ==Honours== *Munster Senior League **Winners: 1966\u201367, 1973\u201374, 1988\u201389, 1989\u201390: 4 **Runners-up: 1967\u201368, 1974\u201375, 1979\u201380, 1983\u201384, 1984\u201385, 1987\u201388: 6 *FAI Intermediate Cup **Winners: 1978\u201379, 1980\u201381, 1986\u201387: 3 **Runners-up: 1966\u201367, 1979\u201380, 1981\u201382, 1987\u201388: 4 *FAI Youth Cup **Winners: 1957\u201358, 1979\u201380, 1981\u201382: 3 **Runners-up: 1961\u201362, 1976\u201377: 2 *Munster Senior Cup **Runners-up: 1980\u201381, 1989\u201390: 2 ==References== ==External links== * Tramore Athletic on Facebook Category:Association football clubs in County Cork Category:1948 establishments in Ireland Category:Munster Senior League (association football) clubs Category:Association football clubs in Cork (city) Category:Former Cork Athletic Union League clubs Category:Association football clubs established in 1948 ",
