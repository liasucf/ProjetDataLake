She is a prominent figure in Tudor history and literature.More History accessed 5/30/2015 She was the daughter of Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Adern) and Sir Richard Harpur. Elizabeth was the daughter of Sir Peter Adern and his wife Catherine. Her first husband was John Middleton, a merchant, with whom she had a son and two daughters, only one of whom, her daughter also named Alice (1501-1563), survived infancy. John Middleton died in 1509, leaving her a young widow. After her marriage to Thomas More in 1511, he raised her daughter Alice as his own. They did not have children together.Tudor history accessed 5/30/2015 Historians have concluded that Sir Thomas More married Alice so he could have a step-mother for his four children after his first wife, Jane, died in 1511. One of her step-daughters was Margaret More. Alice was also considered wealthy, as her first husband left her all of his estate, and her family owned property. Historians also believe that Thomas More had known Alice and her family long before they were married, which is why the couple married without hesitation within weeks of Jane's death. Alice was seven years older than Sir Thomas. The family lived in London and later at the estate built in Chelsea.Encyclopedia of Tudor England accessed 5/30/2015 She was known for her love of animals, especially her dogs, and her pet monkey.More Family history accessed 5/30/2015 She was married to Sir Thomas from 1511 until he was executed in 1535 after he was convicted of treason for refusing to take the Oath of Supremacy. Before his execution, while he was locked in the Tower of London, she was in charge of taking care of his affairs. The last years of her life were poor, due to the family's property being confiscated. The Crown voided the trust her husband had belatedly established for her, Henry VIII of England instead allowed her a smaller annuity of \u00a320 in 1537, to live on after his death. Her death date is most often referred to as April 1551, but some sources state 1546. Her daughter Alice bore several children, giving her many blood descendants.Lady Alice biography accessed 5/30/2015 Her husband was canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1935 as a martyr of the schism that separated the Church of England from Rome. ==In popular culture== Alice is a major role in the stage play A Man for All Seasons by Robert Bolt.
