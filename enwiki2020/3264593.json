    "text": "Leo II (or Leo B) is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy about 690,000 light-years away in the constellation Leo. It is one of 24 known satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. Leo II is thought to have a core radius of 178 \u00b1 13 pc and a tidal radius of 632 \u00b1 32 pc. It was discovered in 1950 by Robert George Harrington and Albert George Wilson, from the Mount Wilson and Palomar Observatories in California. ==Recent Findings== In 2007 a team of 15 scientists observed Leo II through the 8.2 meter Subaru optical-infrared telescope in Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Over 2 nights, 90 minutes of exposures were taken and 82,252 stars were detected down to a visible magnitude of 26. They found that Leo II consists largely of metal-poor older stars, a sign that it has survived the galactic cannibalism under which massive galaxies (e.g., the Milky Way) consume smaller galaxies to attain their extensive size. Observation at ESO estimates Leo II's mass to be (2.7 \u00b1 0.5)\u00d7107 M\u2299. ==See also== *Dwarf galaxy *Local Group, a description of the group of galaxies that includes the Milky Way. ==References== * ==External links== * Category:Dwarf elliptical galaxies Category:Peculiar galaxies Category:Local Group Category:Milky Way Subgroup Category:Leo (constellation) 34176 ?
