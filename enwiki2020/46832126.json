He did his early schooling at the local village school and passed the intermediate examination from Aligarh. He graduated from St. John's College, Agra where he mixed with students most of whom were attracted to leftist ideology and took a degree in law. Rabbani started writing during the college days under the pseudonym, Farchat but later, changed it to Taban. His leftist leanings got him into trouble with the British authorities and post independence, with the Indian law and order and he had to suffer incarceration on two occasions. Around this time, he joined Maktaba-e-Jamia, a Delhi-based publishing group and took to serious writing. He stayed with the organization for a number of years as its general manager till his retirement in 1975. After retirement, he continued writing while engaging in journalism as well. The Government of India awarded him the civilian honour of Padma Shri in 1971. He received the Sahitya Akademi award in 1979 for his anthology, Nava-e-avara. Rabbani had three daughters. Azra Rizvi, one of his daughters, was among the trio of writers, the others being Ajmal Ajmali and Sughra Mehdi, who wrote Rabbani's biography published by Mahnamah Kitab Numa, New Delhi in 1993 under the name, Ghulam Rabbani Taban : shakhsiyat aur adabi khidmat. He died in 1992. ==See also== * Ghazal ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * * * ==External links== * * Category:Recipients of the Padma Shri in literature & education Category:Recipients of the Sahitya Akademi Award in Urdu Category:1914 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Indian people of Pashtun descent Category:People from Farrukhabad district Category:Poets from Uttar Pradesh Category:20th-century Indian lawyers Category:Urdu poets from India Category:Indian male poets Category:20th-century Indian poets Category:20th- century Indian male writers ",
