    "text": "\"Before It's Too Late (Sam and Mikaela's Theme)\" or simply \"Before It's Too Late\" is a song from the Transformers soundtrack, Transformers: The Album, and the 25th single by the Goo Goo Dolls. It was released on June 5, 2007. The song itself was the first single to be released for the soundtrack reaching 86 on Billboard Hot 100 and 9 on Hot Adult Top 40, although the song, \"What I've Done\" by Linkin Park was written and used for most of the Transformers promotional purposes (possibly due to the lyrics of \"What I've Done\" better suiting the overall theme of the film). The song was later included on the band's second compilation album Greatest Hits Volume One: The Singles. ==Track listing== # \"Before It's Too Late (Sam And Mikaela's Theme)\" - 3:02 ==Chart positions== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (2007) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |UK Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|176 |-z |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|86 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Digital Songs |align=\"center\"|73 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Hot Adult Top 40 |align=\"center\"|9 |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Chart (2007) !Position |- |US Adult Top 40 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|37 |} == References == Category:2007 singles Category:Goo Goo Dolls songs Category:Songs written by John Rzeznik Category:Transformers music Category:Rock ballads Category:2007 songs ",
