    "text": "The 2005 Tim Hortons Brier, the Canadian men's curling championship, was held at Rexall Place in Edmonton, Alberta from March 5 to 13. The tournament consisted of 12 teams, one from each province, plus a team representing the Yukon and Northwest Territories, plus a team representing Northern Ontario. The defending champion, Mark Dacey did not participate, as he was knocked out in the Nova Scotia final by Shawn Adams' team. The tournament featured 3-time Brier champion (2001, 2002, 2003) Randy Ferbey of Alberta, 1998 Champion Wayne Middaugh of Ontario, 2003 and 2004 Newfoundland and Labrador champion Brad Gushue, 2000 and 2002 Nova Scotia champion Shawn Adams, 1992 and 2001 Yukon/Northwest Territories champion skip Steve Moss, 1986 New Brunswick champion Wade Blanchard, 2002 and 2003 British Columbia champion (third and second respectively for Pat Ryan), Deane Horning, 1981 and 1996 Prince Edward Island champion lead for Peter MacDonald, Rod MacDonald; 2003 Quebec champion second for Guy Hemmings, Jean-Michel M\u00e9nard as well as three new teams: Randy Dutiaume of Manitoba, Mike Jakubo of Northern Ontario and Pat Simmons of Saskatchewan. The event was a success, with the total attendance of 281,985 setting a Brier record. In the end, the home town team of Randy Ferbey and company won. This was the fourth win in 5 years for the team in their fifth final appearance in a row. They would set a record for the most Brier wins as a complete team. The final, against Shawn Adams' Nova Scotia rink, marked the third year in a row Nova Scotia and Alberta met in the final.

The first and second place teams play each other, with the winner advancing directly to the final. The winner of the other page playoff game between the third and fourth place teams plays the loser of the first/second playoff game in the semi-final. The winner of the semi-final moves on to the final. ===1 vs. 2 game=== Friday, March 11, 20:30 Alberta advanced to the 2005 Brier Final with a 7-4 win over Manitoba. The 7th end proved to be pivotal, as Alberta stole it to take a 5-3 lead. Manitoba played Nova Scotia in the semifinal. ===3 vs. 4 game=== Friday, March 11, 13:00 Nova Scotia eliminated Quebec, giving them a berth in the semifinal. Nova Scotia skip Shawn Adams clinched the game with a draw to the 4-foot to beat two Quebec stones on his last shot of the 10th end. ===Semifinal=== Saturday, March 12, 14:00 A mistake by Manitoba's Randy Dutiaume on his final shot in the third end allowed Shawn Adams' Nova Scotia rink to pick up 4 points, and they never looked back despite a late come-back by Manitoba. Nova Scotia would advance to the 2005 Brier Final. ===Final=== Sunday, March 13, 19:00 Nova Scotia and Alberta would meet in the Brier Final for the third year in a row, except this time with a different Nova Scotia team. Ferbey and his Alberta foursome were making their fifth straight final appearance. In a close game, Alberta's questionable calls proved to be anything but costly. In the 9th end, Alberta's fourth David Nedohin on his first shot took out his own rock which would end up forcing a blank to keep hammer in the 10th. In the 10th end, Nedohin made another controversial shot, drawing to the 4-foot instead of peeling the corner guard. This forced Nova Scotia's Shawn Adams to make a difficult draw to keep hope alive. Adams' shot sat at the back of the 4-foot, and all Nedohin had to do to win was draw again for the win, which he did. It was their fourth Brier win in the last 5 years. ==Awards== * Tournament Most Valuable Player: David Nedohin, Alberta First All-Star team * Lead: Marcel Rocque, Alberta * Second: Scott Pfeifer, Alberta * Third: Randy Ferbey, Alberta * Fourth: David Nedohin, Alberta Second All- Star team * Lead: Kelly Mittelstadt, Nova Scotia * Second: Greg Melnichuk, Manitoba * Third: Paul Flemming, Nova Scotia * Skip: Shawn Adams, Nova Scotia ==Statistics== ===Top 5 player percentages=== Round Robin only, minimum 8 games {| table |valign=top| {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"background: #ffffcc; width:155px;\"| Leads !! style=\"background: #ffffcc;\"| % |- | Marcel Rocque || 90 |- | Kelly Mittelstadt || 87 |- | Scott Bailey || 85 |- | Ben Hebert || 85 |- | Geoff Porter || 85 |} |valign=top| {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"background: #ffffcc; width:155px;\"| Seconds !! style=\"background: #ffffcc;\"| % |- | Scott Pfeifer || 88 |- | Craig Burgess || 83 |- | Greg Melnichuk || 82 |- | Joe Frans || 81 |- | Chris Haichert || 81 |} |valign=top| {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"background: #ffffcc; width:190px;\"| Thirds !! style=\"background: #ffffcc;\"| % |- | Randy Ferbey || 86 |- | Paul Flemming || 84 |- | Kevin Champion || 83 |- | Graeme McCarrel || 81 |- | Jonathon Solberg || 80 |} |valign=top| {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"background: #ffffcc; width:170px;\"| Skips !! style=\"background: #ffffcc;\"| % |- | David Nedohin || 83 |- | Shawn Adams || 81 |- | Wayne Middaugh || 81 |- | Jean-Michel M\u00e9nard || 79 |- | Brad Gushue || 78 |} |} ==Provincial playdowns== Defending provincial champions indicated in bold. ===Alberta=== @ the Innisfail Arena in Innisfail.
