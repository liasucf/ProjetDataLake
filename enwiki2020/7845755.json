It is the diaconia assigned to Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke, patron of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. ==History== The church was built by Ricimer for the Goths c. 460. The Goths were Arians, so when Arianism was suppressed in Rome, the building was taken over by the Catholic Church, in 592 or 593, and reconsecrated by Pope Gregory the Great. It was restored in the 9th century, and a Benedictine monastery was founded next to it. The apse of the church collapsed in 1589, and it was partially rebuilt in 1633,A Handbook of Rome and Its Environs, Rome: J. Murray, 1875 p. 152 without major changes to the building itself apart from the new apse. The small courtyard outside the church was laid out at this time. The church has been served by the Stigmatines since 1926. Their generalate is adjacent to it. It is the only Arian church that has been preserved in Rome. ==Exterior== Exterior The Romanesque campanile was built in the 12th century. The fa\u00e7ade was rebuilt by Francesco Ferrari in 1729. The relief above the door shows St. Agatha holding her severed breast on a plate; her torturers severed her breasts when she refused to renounce her faith in Christ. The entrance from Via Mazzarino opens on a 17th-century courtyard. From 1836 to 1926, it belonged to the Irish College. Cardinal Paul Cullen, a former Rector of the Irish College, modelled the church of the Holy Cross College in Clonliffe in Dublin on the plans of St Agatha's. ==Interior== Although it was redecorated in the Baroque style and has some 19th-century additions, it is still possible to see traces of the 5th-century plan, which was a basilica with three naves. The granite columns separating the naves are ancient. The fresco in the apse shows the Glory of St Agatha, made by Paolo Gismondi in the 17th century. There is a 12th- or 13th-century canopy above the altar, reassembled and erected here in 1933. It has four columns of pavonazzetto marble, all decorated with Cosmatesque mosaic, and a temple roof. The former canopy was destroyed in 1589; fragments can be seen in the ceiling of the main chapel on the left-hand side. The 15th-century Cosmatesque pavement in the middle of the nave has an unusual, but very nice, design. It is a very late example of the style. The rectangular windows were installed in the 17th century at the request of the Cardinals Francesco and Antonio Barberini. By the altar of St Agatha is a large statue of the saint. Ricimer, who was buried in the church, had a mosaic installed. This was unfortunately destroyed in 1589, when the apse collapsed. The Greek humanist John Lascaris (died 1535) is interred in the church and the heart of Daniel O'Connell, the 'Liberator' (died Genoa 1847), is buried here. ==Liturgy== The feast of the Greek martyrs whose relics are preserved here is on 2 December. It is usually celebrated with an evening Mass with the liturgy of the Byzantine Catholic rite. Other important feasts are that of St Agatha on 5 February and St Gaspar Bertoni, founder of the Stigmatines, on 12 June. == Titulars == Pro illa vice, literally \"for that turn\", indicates a temporary appointment. In commendam indicates that a bishop who holds one title is also granted oversight of another vacant title. A titular see is an episcopal see of a former diocese. A titular see is generally conferred on a non-residential bishop such as an auxiliary bishop in another diocese, nuncios and members of the Curia, and occasionally, ordinaries who have resigned or retired from their primary see.Corrigan, Owen B., \"Titular sees of the American hierarchy\", The Catholic Historical Review, Washington DC: The Catholic University Of America, vol.6, issue 3, Oct 1920, pp. 322\u2013323 {| |valign=\"top\" style=\"padding\u2013right: 0%\" | * Giovanni (circa 1030 or 1025\u20131036) * Oderisio (or Oderisius) (1059\u20131088) * Oderisio dei Conti di Sangro (1112\u20131122) * Vitale Savelli (1130?\u2013?) * Oderisio (1131\u20131137), pseudocardinal of Antipope Anacletus II * Bernard de Garves (1310\u20131316) * Galeotto Tarlati de Petramala (1378\u20131388) * Louis of Bar (1397\u20131409), pseudocardinal of Antipope Benedict XIII * Bartolom\u00e9 Mart\u00ed (1496\u20131500) * Ludovico Podocathor, pro illa vice (1500\u20131504) * Gabriele de' Gabrielli (1505\u20131507) * Vacant (1507\u20131517) * Ercole Rangone (1517\u20131527) * Pirro Gonzaga (1528\u20131529) * Francesco Pisani (1529\u20131545) * Tiberio Crispo (1545\u20131551); pro illa vice (1551\u20131562) * Fulvio Giulio della Corgna, pro illa vice (1562\u20131565) * Giovanni Michele Saraceni, pro illa vice (1565) * Giovanni Battista Cicala, pro illa vice (1565\u20131568) * Tolomeo Gallio (1568\u20131587) * Girolamo Mattei (1587) * Benedetto Giustiniani (1587\u20131589) * Federico Borromeo seniore (1589\u20131591) * Charles de Lorraine (1591\u20131607) * Luigi Capponi (1608\u20131620) * Marcantonio Gozzadini, pro illa vice (1623) * Ottavio Ridolfi, pro illa vice (1623\u20131624) * Francesco Barberini (1624\u20131632) * Antonio Barberini (1632\u20131642) * Giulio Gabrielli (1642\u20131655) * Giovanni Stefano Donghi (1655\u20131669) * Friedrich von Hessen\u2013Darmstadt (1670\u20131682) |valign=\"top\" style=\"padding\u2013right: 0%\" | * Girolamo Casanate (1682\u20131686) * Felice Rospigliosi (1686\u20131688) * Benedetto Pamphilj (1688\u20131693) * Carlo Bichi (1693\u20131718) * Lorenzo Altieri (1718\u20131730) * Carlo Colonna (1730\u20131739) * Carlo Maria Marini (1739\u20131741) * Alessandro Albani (1741\u20131743) * Agapito Mosca (1743\u20131760) * Girolamo Colonna di Sciarra (1760\u20131763) * Prospero Colonna di Sciarra (1763\u20131765) * Luigi Maria Torregiani (1765\u20131777) * Domenico Orsini d'Aragona (1777\u20131779) * Andrea Negroni (1779\u20131789) * Raniero Finocchietti (1789\u20131793) * Ludovico Flangini Giovanelli (1794\u20131800) * Ercole Consalvi (1800\u20131817) * Agostino Rivarola (1817\u20131826) * Juan Francisco Marco y Catal\u00e1n (1829\u20131841) * Giacomo Antonelli (1847\u20131868); in commendam (1868\u20131876) * Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Fallorx du Cordray (1877\u20131879) * Giuseppe Pecci (1879\u20131890) * Vacant (1890\u20131894) * Andreas Steinhuber (1894\u20131907) * Gaetano Bisleti (1911\u20131928), pro illa vice (1928\u20131937) * Konrad von Preysing, pro illa vice (1946\u20131950) * John Francis D'Alton, pro illa vice (1953\u20131963) * Enrico Dante (1965\u20131967) * Silvio Oddi (1969\u20131979), pro illa vice (1979\u20132001) * Tom\u00e1\u0161 \u0160pidl\u00edk (2003\u20132010) * Raymond Leo Burke (2010-) |} ==References== ==Sources== *Lucinda Byatt, \"Sant'Agata dei Goti on the Quirinal: An Early Sixteenth- Century Fulcrum for Politics and Learning under Cardinal Ridolfi,\" Conference: Early Modern Rome 1341-1667, University of California Rome, 13-15 May 2010 *Burial of O'Connell's heart in Rome Category:460s establishments Category:17th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:18th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:Roman Catholic churches in Rome Agata Category:5th-century churches Category:Ostrogothic art Category:Churches of Rome (rione Monti) ",
