Dale-Jones and M\u00fcller met at the International Theatre School Jacques Lecoq,http://www.watfordtheatre.co.uk/pl94cast.html and initially worked with other performers they had met at the school. The Lecoq approach to theatre remains a large influence on the company\u2019s work. Since 1994, Hoipolloi have created and toured 18 new shows. == Productions == All Hoipolloi productions are devised by the company's core artistic team, led by Artistic Director Sh\u00f4n Dale-Jones, including input from the performers, with improvisation playing a large role in the creation of each show.FAQs : Hoipolloi Hoipolloi shows are often highly theatrical and humorous. Sh\u00f4n Dale-Jones\u2019 interest in nonsense literature is reflected in Hoipolloi\u2019s last two ensemble shows, The Doubtful Guest, inspired by the book of the same name by Edward Gorey, and My Uncle Arly, which was inspired by the work of Edward Lear .
