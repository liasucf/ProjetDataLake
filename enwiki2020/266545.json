    "text": "The Citro\u00ebn DS () is a front-engine, front-wheel-drive executive car that was manufactured and marketed by the French company Citro\u00ebn from 1955 to 1975 in sedan, wagon/estate and convertible body configurations across three series/generations. Noted for its aerodynamic, futuristic body design and innovative technology, the DS set new standards in ride quality, handling, and braking \u2014 the latter as the first mass production car equipped with disc brakes. Italian sculptor and industrial designer Flaminio Bertoni and the French aeronautical engineer Andr\u00e9 Lef\u00e8bvre styled and engineered the car, and Paul Mag\u00e8s developed the hydropneumatic self-levelling suspension. Citro\u00ebn sold 1,455,746 examples, including 1,330,755 manufactured at the manufacturer's Paris Quai Andr\u00e9-Citro\u00ebn production plant. The DS placed third in the 1999 Car of the Century poll recognizing the world's most influential auto designs and was named the most beautiful car of all time by Classic & Sports Car magazine. ==Model history== After 18 years of secret development as the successor to the Traction Avant, the DS 19 was introduced on 5 October 1955 at the Paris Motor Show. In the first 15 minutes of the show, 743 orders were taken, and orders for the first day totalled 12,000. During the 10 days of the show, the DS took in 80,000 deposits; a record that stood for over 60 years, until it was eclipsed by the Tesla Model 3 which received 180,000 first day deposits in March 2016. Contemporary journalists said the DS pushed the envelope in the ride vs. handling compromise possible in a motor vehicle. To a France still deep in reconstruction after the devastation of World War II, and also building its identity in the post-colonial world, the DS was a symbol of French ingenuity.Fifty Cars That Changed the World by Design Museum, 2010, The DS was distributed to many territories throughout the world. Turn indicators were mounted in the upper corners of the rear window It also posited the nation's relevance in the Space Age, during the global race for technology of the Cold War. Structuralist philosopher Roland Barthes, in an essay about the car, said that it looked as if it had \"fallen from the sky\". An American advertisement summarised this selling point: \"It takes a special person to drive a special car\". Because they were owned by the technologically aggressive tire manufacturer Michelin, Citro\u00ebn had designed their cars around the technically superior radial tire since 1948, and the DS was no exception. The car featured a novel hydropneumatic suspension including an automatic leveling system and variable ground clearance,\"...gliding on air with only the flick of the speedometer needle to remind you you're in motion! No bumping, jerking, dragging, lurching.\" From an ad for the Citro\u00ebn stand at the Motor Show, London, 1957 developed in-house by Paul Mag\u00e8s. This suspension allowed the DS to travel quickly on the poor road surfaces common in France. In addition, the vehicle had power steering and a semi-automatic transmission (the transmission required no clutch pedal, but gears still had to be shifted by hand), though the shift lever controlled a powered hydraulic shift mechanism in place of a mechanical linkage, and a fibreglass roof which lowered the centre of gravity and so reduced weight transfer. Inboard front brakes (as well as independent suspension) reduced unsprung weight. Different front and rear track widths reduced the unequal tyre loading, which is well known to promote understeer, typical of front-engined and front-wheel drive cars. As with all French cars, the DS design was affected by the tax horsepower system, which effectively encouraged smaller engines. Unlike the Traction Avant predecessor, there was no top-of-range model with a powerful six-cylinder engine. Citro\u00ebn had planned an air-cooled flat-6 engine for the car, but did not have the funds to put the prototype engine into production. The DS placed third in the 1999 Car of the Century competition, and fifth on the 2005 list of \"100 Coolest Cars\" by Automobile Magazine. It was also named the most beautiful car of all time by Classic & Sports Car magazine after a poll of 20 world-renowned car designers, including Giorgetto Giugiaro, Ian Callum, Roy Axe, Paul Bracq, and Leonardo Fioravanti. == Name == Both the DS and its simpler sibling, the ID, used a punning name. \"DS\" is pronounced in French as \"D\u00e9esse\" (goddess); \"ID\" is pronounced as \"Id\u00e9e\" (idea). ==Motorsport== 1000 Lakes Rally The DS was successful in motorsports like rallying, where sustained speeds on poor surfaces are paramount, and won the Monte Carlo Rally in 1959. In the 1000 Lakes Rally, Pauli Toivonen drove a DS19 to victory in 1962. In 1966, the DS won the Monte Carlo Rally again, with some controversy as the competitive BMC Mini-Cooper team was disqualified due to rule infractions. Ironically, Mini was involved with DS competition again two years later, when a drunk driver in a Mini in Sydney Australia crashed into the DS that was leading the 1968 London\u2013Sydney Marathon, from the finish line. Robert Neyret won the Rallye du Maroc in 1969 and 1970 in a DS 21. The DS was still competitive in the grueling 1974 London-Sahara-Munich World Cup Rally, where it won over 70 other cars, only 5 of which even completed the entire event. ==Technical innovation \u2013 hydraulic systems== At rest, Citro\u00ebn DS will slowly sink to the ground as the engine-driven hydraulic system is depressurized In conventional cars, hydraulics are only used in brakes and power steering. In the DS they were also used for the suspension, clutch, and transmission. The cheaper 1957 ID19 did have manual steering and a simplified power braking system. An engine-driven pump pressurizes the closed system to http://www.citroen-ds-id.com/ At a time when few passenger vehicles had independent suspension on all wheels, the application of the hydraulic system to the car's suspension system to provide a self-levelling system was an innovative move. This suspension allowed the car to achieve sharp handling combined with very high ride quality, frequently compared to a \"magic carpet\". The hydropneumatic suspension used was pioneered the year before, on the rear of another car from Citro\u00ebn, the top of range Traction Avant 15CV-H. ==Impact on Citro\u00ebn brand development== Two DS and Traction Avant The 1955 DS cemented the Citro\u00ebn brand name as an automotive innovator, building on the success of the Traction Avant, which had been the world's first mass-produced unitary body front-wheel-drive car in 1934. In fact, the DS caused such a huge sensation that Citro\u00ebn was apprehensive that future models would not be of the same bold standard. No clean sheet new models were introduced from 1955 to 1970. The DS was a large, expensive executive car and a downward brand extension was attempted, but without result. Throughout the late 1950s and 1960s Citro\u00ebn developed many new vehicles for the very large, profitable market segments between the 2CV and the DS, occupied by vehicles like the Peugeot 403, Renault 16 and Ford Cortina, but none made it into production. Either they had uneconomic build costs, or were ordinary \"me too\" cars, not up to the company's high standard of innovation. As Citro\u00ebn was owned by Michelin from 1934 to 1974 as a sort of research laboratory, such broad experimentation was possible. Michelin was getting a powerful advertisement for the capabilities of the radial tire Michelin had invented, when such experimentation was successful. New models based on the small, utilitarian 2CV economy car were introduced, notably the 1961 Ami. It was also designed by Flaminio Bertoni and aimed to combine Three-box styling with the chassis of the 2CV. The Ami was very successful in France, but less so on export markets. Many found the styling controversial, and the car noisy and underpowered. The Dyane was a modernised 2CV with a hatchback that competed with the 2CV inspired Renault 4 Hatchback. All these 2 cylinder models were very small, so there remained a wide market gap to the DS range all through the 1960s. In 1970, Citro\u00ebn finally introduced a car to target the mid-range - the Citro\u00ebn GS, which won the \"European car of the Year\" for 1971 and sold 2.5 million units. It combined a small flat-4 air-cooled engine with Hydropneumatic suspension. The intended Wankel rotary-engined version with more power did not reach full production. ==Replacing the DS== The DS remained popular and competitive throughout its production run. Its peak production year was 1970. Certain design elements like the somewhat narrow cabin, column-mounted gearstick, and separate fenders began to seem a little old-fashioned in the 1970s. Citro\u00ebn invested enormous resources to design and launch an entirely new vehicle in 1970, the SM, which was in effect a thoroughly modernized DS, with similar length, but greater width. The manual gearbox was a modified DS unit. The front disc brakes were the same design. Axles, wheel bearings, steering knuckles, and hydraulic components were either DS parts or modified DS parts.Citro\u00ebn SM parts and repair manuals The SM had a different purpose than replacing the 15-year-old DS design, however - it was meant to launch Citro\u00ebn into a completely new luxury grand touring market segment. Only fitted with a costly, exotic Maserati engine, the SM was faster and much more expensive than the DS. The SM was not designed to be a practical 4-door saloon suitable as a large family car, the key market for vehicles of this type in Europe. Typically, manufacturers would introduce low-volume coup\u00e9s based on parts shared with an existing saloon, not as unique models, a contemporary example being the Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class.Mercedes-Benz Buyer's Guide, Fred Larimer, 2004, Page 81 BMW follows a similar strategy of a mid-size sedan (5 series), large coupe (6 series), and large sedan (7 series) sharing common underpinnings. The SM's high price and limited utility of the 2+2 seating configuration meant the SM as actually produced could not seize the mantle from the DS. While the design funds invested would allow the DS to be replaced by two cars, a 'modern DS' and the smaller CX, it was left to the CX alone to provide Citro\u00ebn's large family or executive car in the model range. The last DS came off the production line on 24 April 1975 - the manufacturer had taken the elementary precaution of building up approximately eight months of inventory of the \"break\" (estate/station wagon) version of the DS, to cover the period till the autumn of 1975, when the estate/station wagon version of the CX would be introduced. ==Development== The DS maintained its size and shape, with easily removable, unstressed body panels, but design changes occurred. During the 20-year production, improvements were made on an ongoing basis. ===ID 19 submodel to extend brand downwards (1957\u201369)=== The 1955 DS19 was 65% more expensive than the car it replaced, the Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant.Bobbitt, p. 64. This affected potential sales in a country still recovering economically from World War II, so a cheaper submodel, the Citro\u00ebn ID, was introduced in 1957. 1967 Citro\u00ebn ID19B The ID shared the DS's body but was less powerful and luxurious. Although it shared the engine capacity of the DS engine (at this stage 1,911 cc), the ID provided a maximum power output of only compared to the claimed for the DS19. Power outputs were further differentiated in 1961 when the DS19 acquired a Weber-32 twin bodied carburettor, and the increasing availability of higher octane fuel enabled the manufacturer to increase the compression ratio from 7.5:1 to 8.5:1. A new DS19 now came with a promised . The ID19 was also more traditional mechanically: it had no power steering and had conventional transmission and clutch instead of the DS's hydraulically controlled set-up. Initially, the basic ID19 was sold on the French market with a price saving of more than 25% against the DS, although the differential was reduced at the end of 1961 when the manufacturer withdrew the entry-level ID19 \"Normale\". A station wagon variant, the ID Break, was introduced in 1958. ===D Sp\u00e9cial and D Super (1970\u201375)=== The ID was replaced by the D Sp\u00e9cial and D Super in 1970, but these retained the lower specification position in the range. The D Super was available with the DS21 2175 cc engine and a 5-speed gearbox, and named the D Super 5. ===Series 2 - Nose redesign in 1962=== In September 1962, the DS was restyled with a more aerodynamically efficient nose, better ventilation, and other improvements. It retained the open two headlamp appearance, but was available with an optional set of driving lights mounted on the front fenders. All models in the range changed nose design at the same time, including the ID and station wagon models. ===Series 3 - Nose redesign in 1967 with directional headlights=== In late 1967, for the 1968 model year, the DS and ID was again restyled, by Robert Opron, who also styled the 1970 SM and 1974 CX. This version had a more streamlined headlamp design, giving the car a notably shark-like appearance. This design had four headlights under a smooth glass canopy and the inner set swivelled with the steering wheel. This allowed the driver to see \"around\" turns, especially valuable on twisting roads driven at high speed at night. The directional headlamps were linked to the wheels by cable. Behind each glass cover lens, the inboard high-beam headlamp swivels by up to 80\u00b0 as the driver steers, throwing the beam along the driver's intended path rather than uselessly across the curved road. The outboard low-beam headlamps are self-leveling in response to pitching caused by acceleration and braking.Autocar Road Test No. 2056; 3 December 1965 However, this feature was not allowed in the US at the time (see World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations), so a version with four exposed headlights that did not swivel was made for the US market. Although a directional headlight was previously seen on the 1948 Tucker 48 'Torpedo', Citro\u00ebn was the first to mass-market adaptive headlights. ===New \"green\" hydraulic fluid=== The original hydropneumatic system used a vegetable oil (liquide hydraulique v\u00e9g\u00e9tal, LHV), but later switched to a synthetic (liquide hydraulique synth\u00e9tique, LHS). Both had the disadvantage of being hygroscopic. Disuse allows water to enter the hydraulic components, causing deterioration and requiring expensive maintenance. The difficulty with hygroscopic hydraulic fluid was exacerbated in the DS/ID due to the extreme rise and fall in the fluid level in the reservoir, which went from nearly full to nearly empty when the suspension extended to maximum height and the six accumulators in the system filled with fluid. With every \"inhalation\" of fresh moisture- (and dust-) laden air, the fluid absorbed more water. For the 1967 model year, Citro\u00ebn introduced a new mineral oil-based fluid LHM (Liquide Hydraulique Min\u00e9ral). This fluid was much less harsh on the system. LHM required completely different materials for the seals. Using either fluid in the incorrect system would completely destroy the hydraulic seals very quickly. To help avoid this problem, Citro\u00ebn added a bright green dye to the LHM fluid and also painted all hydraulic elements bright green. The former LHS parts were painted black. All models, including the station wagon and ID, were upgraded at the same time. The hydraulic fluid changed to the technically superior LHM in all markets except the US and Canada, where the change did not take place until January 1969, due to local regulations. ==International sales and production== The DS was primarily manufactured at the Quai Andr\u00e9-Citro\u00ebn in the Javel neighborhood of Paris, with other manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom, South Africa, the former Yugoslavia (mostly Break Ambulances), and Australia. Australia constructed their own D variant in the 1960s at Heidelberg, Victoria, identified as the ID 19 \"Parisienne.\"ID 19 \"Parisienne\", made in Heidelberg, Australia Retrieved 14 August 2012 Australian market cars were fitted with options as standard equipment such as the \"DSpecial DeLuxe\" that were not available on domestic European models. Until 1965 UK cars were assembled at the manufacturer's Slough premises, to the west of London, using a combination of French-made knock down kits and locally sourced components, some of them machined on site. A French electrical system superseded the British one on the Slough cars in 1962, giving rise to a switch to \"continental style\" negative earthing. An intermediate model between the DS and the ID, called the DW, was introduced on the UK market in 1963 with a manual transmission and simpler foot-operated clutch while retaining the DS power unit, power steering and power braking; outside of the UK this model was known as the DS19M. When the 1985 cc engine replaced the original 1911 cc unit in September 1965 the manual-equipped DSes built in Slough were renamed DS19A. The Slough factory closed on 18 February 1966 and thereafter cars for the British market were imported fully assembled from the company's French plant. The British-built cars are distinguished by their leather seats, wooden (early ID19 models) or one-piece plastic (early DS19 models) dashboards, chromed number plate mount set into the front bumper, and (on pre-1962 cars) Lucas- made electrics. These were all right hand drive cars. The DS was built and sold in South Africa from 1959 to 1975. The DS was sold in Japan, but the models were built in France and left hand drive. From 2005 to 2008, a young Frenchman named Manuel Boileau traveled around the world in a 1971 DS ambulance. It was an journey across 38 countries called Lunaya World Tour. While traveling through Laos, he located the forlorn 1974 DS Prestige belonging to Sisavang Vatthana, the last King of the Kingdom of Laos, which is now preserved and restored by specialists in Bangkok. ==DS in North America== The DS was sold in North America from 1956 to 1972. Despite its popularity in Europe, and regard for its design from the American motoring press, it did not sell well in the United States, and little better in Canada. While promoted as a luxury car, it did not have the basic features that American buyers expected to find on such a vehicle, such as an automatic transmission, air conditioning, power windows, or a powerful engine. The DS was designed specifically to address the French market, with punitive tax horsepower taxation of large engines, as well as very poor roads \u2013 it is no great mystery that it was a fish out of water when those constraints were removed. Further harming the DS' prospects on the other side of the Atlantic was an inadequate supply of parts for the vehicle. Jay Leno described the sporadic supply of spare parts as a problem for 1970s era customers, based on his early experiences working at a Citro\u00ebn dealer in Boston. Additionally, the DS was expensive, with a vehicle costing $4,170 in 1969, when the price was $4,500 for a Buick Electra 225 4 door sedan. The Electra was available with an automatic transmission, power windows, and came with a much larger engine (a 7,040 cc V8), and it was hardly the only competitor to the DS to have these features as options or as standard. As a result of the insufficient supply of replacement parts, an inability to compete with bigger and more luxurious cars sold for the same price, and simply having not been designed for the North American market, sales for the DS were mediocre on the North American market, ultimately reaching a total of 38,000. US regulations at the time also banned one of the car's more advanced features: its composite headlamps with aerodynamic covered lenses. Based on legislation that dated from 1940, all automobiles sold in the U.S. were required to have round, sealed-beam headlamps that produced 75,000 candlepower. The DS's quartz iodine swiveling headlamps designed for the 1968 model were not allowed by the regulations. Even the aerodynamic headlight covers, featured on other cars such as the Jaguar E-Type were illegal and had to be removed. It was not until Ford Motor Company lobbied to have composite headlamps allowed that the sealed-beam headlamp requirements were finally rescinded in 1983. However, the European lamps were legal in Canada, including the directional headlamps. The hydraulic fluid change in 1967 also fell afoul of American regulations. NHTSA follows the precautionary principle, also used by the Food and Drug Administration, where new innovations are prohibited until their developers can prove them safe to the regulators. The castor-based LHV and synthetic LHS fluids used in European-market DSes were not certified for use in North America, so cars sold there used conventional brake fluid instead. Brake fluid (as well as LHV and LHS) is hygroscopic and miscible, readily absorbing and mixing with moisture, the idea being that within a closed hydraulic circuit these properties will ensure pockets of non-soluble water will not form and cause corrosion of the system from within. The design of the DS's hydraulic system used much more fluid and allowed much more moist air into the system than a simple hydraulic braking circuit, so the fluid's hygroscopic properties were not preventing corrosion as intended. Brake fluid also did not provide the viscosity and lubricity suited for used in the suspension, clutch and gear change mechanism. Mineral-based LHM fluid was designed to remedy these issues but Citroen was obligated to demonstrate the new fluid was safe for automotive use before it could be installed in American-market cars. It took NHTSA until January 1969 to approve it, so in the US market about half the production of cars in the 1969 model year use the older red LHS fluid and half use newer green LHM fluid, neither of which is compatible with the other. ==Design variations== ===Pallas=== In 1965 a luxury upgrade, the DS Pallas (after Greek goddess Pallas Athena), was introduced. This included comfort features such as better noise insulation, a more luxurious (and optional leather) upholstery, and external trim embellishments. From 1966 the Pallas model received a driver's seat with height adjustment. ===Station Wagon, Familiale, and Ambulance=== A station wagon version was introduced in 1958. It was known by various names in different markets (Break in France, Safari, and Estate in the UK, Wagon in the US, and Citro\u00ebn Australia used the terms Safari and Station-Wagon). It had a steel roof to support the standard roof rack. 'Familiales' had a rear seat- mounted further back in the cabin, with three folding seats between the front and rear squabs. The standard Break had two side-facing seats in the main load area at the back. The Ambulance configuration was similar to that of the Break, but with a 60/30 split in the rear folding seat to accommodate a stretcher. A 'Commerciale' version was also available for a time. The Safari saw use as a camera car, notably by the BBC. The hydropneumatic suspension produces an unusually steady platform for filming while driving.Top Gear, series 8, episode 5 ===Convertible=== A convertible was offered from 1958 until 1973. The D\u00e9capotable Cabriolet d'Usine (factory convertible) were built by French carrossier Henri Chapron, for the Citro\u00ebn dealer network. It was an expensive car and only 1,365 were sold. These DS convertibles used a special frame which was reinforced on the side members and rear suspension swingarm bearing box, similar to, but not identical to the Break (Station Wagon) frame. ===Chapron variations=== In addition, Chapron also produced a few coup\u00e9s, non- works convertibles and special sedans (including the \"Prestige\", same wheelbase but with a central divider, and the \"Lorraine\" notchback). ===Bossaert Coupe=== Between 1959 and 1964, Hector Bossaert produced a coup\u00e9 on a DS chassis shortened by . While the front end remained unchanged, the rear end featured notchback styling. ===The Reactor=== In 1965, noted American auto customizer Gene Winfield created The Reactor, a Citro\u00ebn DS chassis, with a turbocharged flat-six engine from the Corvair driving the front wheels. Since the DS already had the engine behind the front wheels, the longer engine meant only one row of seats. This was draped in a streamlined, low slung, aluminum body. The Reactor was seen in American Television programs of the era, such as Star Trek: The Original Series episode 2.25 (\"Bread and Circuses),\" Batman episodes 110 (\"Funny Feline Felonies\") and 111 (driven by Catwoman Eartha Kitt), and Bewitched, which devoted its episode 3.19 (\"Super Car\") to The Reactor. === Michelin PLR === The Michelin PLR is a mobile tire evaluation machine, based on the DS Break, built in 1972, later used for promotion. ==Technical details== ===Suspension=== In a hydropneumatic suspension system, each wheel is connected, not to a spring, but to a hydraulic suspension unit consisting of a hydraulic accumulator sphere of about 12 cm in diameter containing pressurised nitrogen, a cylinder containing hydraulic fluid screwed to the suspension sphere, a piston inside the cylinder connected by levers to the suspension itself, and a damper valve between the piston and the sphere. A membrane in the sphere prevented the nitrogen from escaping. The motion of the wheels translated to a motion of the piston, which acted on the oil in the nitrogen cushion and provided the spring effect. The damper valve took place of the shock absorber in conventional suspensions. The hydraulic cylinder was fed with hydraulic fluid from the main pressure reservoir via a height corrector, a valve controlled by the mid-position of the anti-roll bar connected to the axle. If the suspension was too low, the height corrector introduced high-pressure fluid; if it was too high, it released fluid back to the fluid reservoir. In this manner, a constant ride height was maintained. A control in the cabin allowed the driver to select one of five heights: normal riding height, two slightly higher-riding heights for poor terrain, and two extreme positions for changing wheels. (The correct term, oleopneumatic (oil-air), has never gained widespread use. Hydropneumatic (water-air) continues to be preferred overwhelmingly.) The DS did not have a jack for lifting the car off the ground. Instead, the hydraulic system enabled wheel changes with the aid of a simple adjustable stand. To change a flat tyre, one would adjust the suspension to its topmost setting, insert the stand into a special peg near the flat tyre, then readjust the suspension to its lowermost setting. The flat tyre would then retract upwards and hover above the ground, ready to be changed. This system, used on the SM also, was superseded on the CX by a screw jack that, after the suspension was raised to the high position, lifted the tire clear of the ground. The DS system, while impressive to use, sometimes dropped the car quite suddenly, especially if the stand was not placed precisely or the ground was soft or unlevel. ===Source and reserve of pressure=== The central part of the hydraulic system was the high-pressure pump, which maintained a pressure of between 130 and 150 bar in two accumulators. These accumulators were very similar in construction to the suspension spheres. One was dedicated to the front brakes, and the other ran the other hydraulic systems. (On the simpler ID models, the front brakes operated from the main accumulator.) Thus in case of a hydraulic failure, the first indication would be that the steering became heavy, followed by the gearbox not working; only later would the brakes fail. Two different hydraulic pumps were used. The DS used a seven-cylinder axial piston pump driven off two belts and delivering 175 bar (2,540 psi) of pressure. The ID19, with its simpler hydraulic system, had a single-cylinder pump driven by an eccentric on the camshaft. ===Gearbox and clutch=== ====Hydraulique or Citromatic==== The DS was initially offered only with the \"hydraulique\" four-speed semi-automatic (bvh\u2014\"bo\u00eete de vitesses hydraulique\") gearbox. This was a four-speed gearbox and clutch, operated by a hydraulic controller. To change gears, the driver flicked a lever behind the steering wheel to the next position and eased-up on the accelerator pedal. The hydraulic controller disengaged the clutch, disengaged the previous gear, then engaged the nominated gear, and re-engaged the clutch. The speed of engagement of the clutch was controlled automatically, responding to hydraulic sensing of engine rpm and the position of the butterfly valve in the carburetor (i.e., the position of the accelerator), and the brake circuit. When the brake was pressed, the engine idle speed dropped to an rpm below the clutch engagement speed, thus preventing friction while stopped in gear at traffic lights. When the brake was released, the idle speed increased to the clutch dragging speed. The car would then creep forward much like automatic transmission cars. This drop in idle throttle position also caused the car to have more engine drag when the brakes were applied even before the car slowed to the idle speed in gear, preventing the engine from pulling against the brakes. In the event of loss of hydraulic pressure (following a loss of system fluid), the clutch would disengage, to prevent driving, while brake pressure reserves would allow safe braking to a standstill. Unlike an automatic transmission, there is no Park position on the transmission where the wheels are locked. In addition, the hydraulic clutch would disengage with the engine stopped, so the car could not be left in gear when parked. The only way to prevent the car from rolling (for example, if parked on a slope) is to use the parking brake. ==== Manual\u2014four- speed and five-speed ==== The later and simpler ID19 had the same gearbox and clutch, manually operated. This configuration was offered as a cheaper option for the DS in 1963. The mechanical aspects of the gearbox and clutch were completely conventional and the same elements were used in the ID 19. In September 1970, Citro\u00ebn introduced a five-speed manual gearbox, in addition to the original four-speed unit. All manual transmissions used a steering column- mounted shifter. ==== Fully automatic ==== In September 1971 Citro\u00ebn introduced a 3-speed fully automatic Borg-Warner 35 transmission gearbox, on the DS 21 and later DS 23 models. The fully automatic transmission DS was never sold in the US market where this type of transmission had gained market share so quickly that it became the majority of the market by this time. Many automatic DSs, fuel-injected DS 23 sedans with air conditioning, were sold in Australia. ===Engines=== Cutaway model shows engine set far back from front wheels (\"MF layout\"), and partially reveals configuration of the oleopneumatic suspension The DS was originally designed around an air-cooled flat-six based on the design of the 2-cylinder engine of the 2CV, similar to the motor in the Porsche 911. Technical and monetary problems forced this idea to be scrapped. Thus, for such a modern car, the engine of the original DS 19 was also old- fashioned. It was derived from the engine of the 11CV Traction Avant (models 11B and 11C). It was an OHV four-cylinder engine with three main bearings and wet liners, and a bore of and a stroke of , giving a volumetric displacement of 1911 cc. The cylinder head had been reworked; the 11C had a reverse-flow cast iron cylinder head and generated at 3800 rpm; by contrast, the DS 19 had an aluminium cross-flow head with hemispherical combustion chambers and generated at 4500 rpm. Like the Traction Avant, the DS had the gearbox mounted in front of the engine, with the differential in between. Thus some consider the DS to be a mid engine front-wheel drive car. The DS and ID powerplants evolved throughout its 20-year production life. The car was underpowered and faced constant mechanical changes to boost the performance of the four- cylinder engine. The initial 1911 cc three main bearing engine (carried forward from the Traction Avant) of the DS 19 was replaced in 1965 with the 1985 cc five-bearing wet-cylinder motor, becoming the DS 19a (called DS 20 from September 1969). Spare tire, mounted under the hood The DS 21 was also introduced for model year 1965. This was a 2175 cc, five main bearing engine; power was 109 hp This engine received a substantial increase in power with the introduction of Bosch electronic fuel injection for 1970, making the DS one of the first mass-market cars to use electronic fuel injection. Power of the carbureted version also increased slightly at the same time, owing to the employment of larger inlet valves. Lastly, 1973 saw the introduction of the 2347 cc engine of the DS 23 in both carbureted and fuel-injected forms. The DS 23 with electronic fuel injection was the most powerful production model, producing .Bobbitt, p. 131. IDs and their variants went through a similar evolution, generally lagging the DS by about one year. ID saloon models never received the DS 23 engine or fuel injection, although the Break/Familiale versions received the carburetted version of the DS 23 engine when it was introduced, supplemented the DS20 Break/Familiale. The top of the range ID model, The DSuper5 (DP) gained the DS21 engine (the only model that this engine was retained in) for the 1973 model year and it was mated to a five- speed gearbox. This should not be confused with the 1985 cc DSuper fitted with an optional \"low ratio\" five-speed gearbox, or with the previous DS21M (DJ) five-speed. ==In popular culture== President Charles de Gaulle survived an assassination attempt at Le Petit-Clamart near Paris on 22 August 1962, planned by Algerian War veteran Jean-Marie Bastien-Thiry. The plan was to ambush the motorcade with machine guns, disable the vehicles, and then close in for the kill. De Gaulle praised the unusual abilities of his unarmoured Citro\u00ebn DS with saving his life \u2013 the car, riddled with bullets and all four tyres punctured, was still able to escape at full speed. Afterward, De Gaulle vowed never to ride in any other make of car. This event was accurately recreated in the 1973 film The Day of the Jackal. The 1961 Citro\u00ebn DS 19 D\u00e9capotable Usine by Henri Chapron garnered publicity for the new model, from its prominent film placement, when Cary Grant himself \"telephoned the French automotive company, Citro\u00ebn, to order a new car for use in the film\" That Touch of Mink. Another D\u00e9capotable Usine (1962 model) was used in the drug smuggling French Connection crime ring, until the car was seized April 26, 1968 after one of it's transatlantic voyages on SS France (1960). It was disassembled by the New York Police Department and contained a record setting seizure of heroin worth $22.4 Million in 1968 dollars. The total amount smuggled during the transatlantic voyages of the DS was according to arrested smuggler Jacques Bousquet. The DS was portrayed by a Lincoln Continental Mark III in The French Connection (1971 film). ==Legacy== Citro\u00ebn DS values have been rising \u2013 a 1973 DS 23 Injection Electronique \"Decapotable\" (Chapron Convertible) sold for \u20ac176,250 (US$209,738) at Christie's R\u00e9tromobile in February 2006. and a similar car sold by Bonhams in February 2009 brought \u20ac343,497 (US$440,436). On 18 September 2009 a 1966 DS21 Decapotable Usine was sold by Bonhams for a hammer price of UK\u00a3131,300. Bonhams sold another DS21 Decapotable (1973) on 23 January 2010 for \u20ac189,000. Citro\u00ebn was the featured exhibit at the Mullin Automotive Museum for the year 2017/8, and the DS made its first appearance on the lawn at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in 2018. The DS's place in French society was demonstrated in Paris on 9 October 2005 with a celebration of the 50th anniversary of its launch. 1,600 DS cars drove in procession past the Arc de Triomphe. In 2009, Groupe PSA created a new brand - DS Automobiles, intended as high quality, high specification variations on existing models, with differing mechanics and bodywork. This brand ranges across four models, the DS3, DS4, DS5, and the China-only SUV DS 6. The DS3, launched in March 2010, is based on Citro\u00ebn's new C3, but is more customisable and unique, bearing some resemblance to the original DS, with its \"Shark Fin\" side pillar. These have created their own niches, with the DS4 being a mix of a crossover and a coupe and the DS5 mixing a coupe and an estate. Many feature hybrid-diesel engines to maximise efficiency. ==Production figures== Citro\u00ebn DS production chart * 1955: 69 * 1956: 9,868 * 1957: 28,593 * 1958: 52,416 * 1959: 66,931 * 1960: 83,205 * 1961: 77,597 * 1962: 83,035 * 1963: 93,476 * 1964: 85,379 * 1965: 89,314 * 1966: 99,561 * 1967: 101,904 * 1968: 81,860 * 1969: 82,218 * 1970: 103,633 * 1971: 84,328 * 1972: 92,483 * 1973: 96,990 * 1974: 40,039 * 1975: 847 == See also == *Road & Track magazine, USA.
