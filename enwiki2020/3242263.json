    "text": "The Dominican University College (DUC; ) is a bilingual university located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Since 2012, Dominican University College has been an affiliated college of Carleton University. Founded in 1900 and granted a civil university charter in 1967, Dominican University College is modeled on the houses of studies of the Order of Preachers and was originally the center of graduate studies for Canadian Dominicans. Today, Dominican offers civil and pontifical bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in philosophy and theology. ==History== The Saint-Jean-Baptiste church was completed in November 1872 at the corner of Primrose and Victoria Avenue (now Empress) in Ottawa. The adjoining Dominican convent and house of studies opened in 1899, modeled after the medieval studium generale specializing in Philosophy and Theology. In 1900, the Dominicans brought their School of Theology to Ottawa, followed shortly thereafter by studies in Philosophy in 1902, and granted ecclesiastical degrees at the level of licentiate. The first regent of the university, from 1900-1920, was Raymond-Marie Rouleau, who would later become archbishop of Quebec and then a Cardinal. In 1930, the Institut d'Etudes Medievales d'Ottawa was established at the convent as the French speaking equivalent to the Institute of Mediaeval Studies at St. Michael's College of the University of Toronto founded in 1929. \u00c9tienne Gilson and Marie-Dominique Chenu were instrumental in the founding of the institute, which relocated to the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al in 1942. On February 8, 1931, fire destroyed the original Saint-Jean-Baptiste church and portions of the convent. The rebuilt church and convent which remain today were opened on Easter 1932. In 1967, a civil charter was granted to the Coll\u00e8ge dominicain de philosophie et de th\u00e9ologie by the Ontario Government, allowing the college to offer civil university degrees in philosophy and theology. The first Doctorate in Theology from Dominican College was granted in 1971. In 1974 Dominican College joined the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada. The university opened its undergraduate and graduate programs in Philosophy to English speaking students in 1992 and 1997 respectively, and established English undergraduate and graduate programs in Theology in 2003 and 2007. Today the building houses the Dominican Monastery and the Dominican University College, which offers undergraduate and graduate studies in philosophy and theology. The building has several architecturally interesting and historically significant features, including cloister vault ceilings, stained glass by Guido Nincheri, and a Casavant Fr\u00e8res organ. ==Research== The Faculty of Philosophy at DUC specializes in the history of philosophy, modern European philosophy and Aristotelian-Thomistic metaphysics. Faculty members come from both the analytic and continental traditions. The Faculty of Theology has strengths in New Testament hermeneutics and value personalism.

First established in 1948 under the name Sciences Eccl\u00e9siastiques by professors in the Faculty of the Society of Jesus in Montreal, the journal specializes in philosophy and theology, and publishes articles in both English and French. ==Student Association== The Association \u00c9tudiants Coll\u00e8ge Dominicain (AECDO) elects representatives to sit on the boards for both the Faculty of Philosophy and of the Faculty of Theology. It organizes and directs various activities (extracurricular, social justice committee, social gathering) pertaining to student life. ==Academics== ===Faculty of Philosophy=== Undergraduate Programs *Bachelor of Philosophy (Honours) *Bachelor of Philosophy (Honours) with minor in Ethics *Bachelor of Arts (Honours) with major in Philosophy and minor in Theology *Bachelor of Arts with concentration in Philosophy *Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy with minor in Ethics Graduate Programs *Master of Arts in Philosophy *Doctorate in Philosophy ===Faculty of Theology=== Undergraduate Programs *Bachelor in Theology *Bachelor of Arts with major in Theology and minor in Philosophy Graduate Programs *Master of Arts in Theology and Licenciate *Master of Theology *Doctorate in Theology (PhD / Canonical Degree) ==Partnerships== ===Institut de pastorale des Dominicains=== In 1967, DUC partnered with the Institut de pastorale des Dominicains in Montreal.
