    "text": "Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez Brotons (born December 6, 1993) is a Cuban citizen who became embroiled in a heated international custody and immigration controversy in 2000 involving the governments of Cuba and the United States, his father Juan Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez Quintana, his other relatives in Cuba and in Miami, and Miami's Cuban community. Gonz\u00e1lez's mother Elizabeth Brotons Rodr\u00edguez drowned in November 1999 while attempting to leave Cuba with Gonz\u00e1lez and her boyfriend to get to the United States. Eli\u00e1n Gonzalez was five years old when found nestled in an inner tube floating at sea three miles from Florida's Fort Lauderdale coast. Two fishermen found Eli\u00e1n and reluctantly handed him over to the U.S. Coast Guard, as they feared he would be sent back to Cuba under the wet foot, dry foot policy since he had not yet reached land. The Coast Guard assured them that Eli\u00e1n would be taken \"ashore for medical reasons,\" deeming him eligible to stay. Eli\u00e1n was immediately taken to a hospital and treated for dehydration and minor cuts on his body. It was later found that Eli\u00e1n's mother, Elisabet Brotons Rodr\u00edguez, and L\u00e1zaro Munero Garc\u00eda, her common-law husband, had escaped C\u00e1rdenas, Cuba, as part of a group with 14 refugees on a boat. However, the others perished in a storm, while a young couple escaped to the shore, and Eli\u00e1n was found. Once treated, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) provided Eli\u00e1n with a temporary deferral regarding his inspection, and further released Eli\u00e1n to his great-uncle, L\u00e1zaro Gonzalez, who lived with his family in Miami's Little Havana. These relatives informed the family in C\u00e1rdenas to prepare for an extreme hardship visa waiver. The former were told the next day that \"some functionary of the government would be coming to get the boy\" as a result of Fidel Castro's having met with Juan Miguel, Eli\u00e1n's father. The involvement of the Cuban Communist leader in the case and the subsequent diplomatic note written to the U.S. Department of State emphasizing the father's demand for Eli\u00e1n's repatriation attracted international attention. This is because Eli\u00e1n had become a \"symbol to many exiles\" reminding them of the solidarity of the Cuban exile community and its privileged status with economic refugee criteria. While Eli\u00e1n escaped both Cuba and death, he soon entered custody battles waged by his father, Miami relatives, and state actors from the U.S. and Cuba. The international tug of war waged between the Cuban and American actors can be understood through the agendas of Fidel Castro; the Cuban American actor Lazaro Gonzalez representing the Miami relatives and the Miami Cuban expat community; and the U.S. government representative, Attorney General Janet Reno. In the case of Fidel Castro, he sought to showcase his power by first issuing an ultimatum to the U.S. that the boy should be returned to his father within 72 hours. On January 10, 2000, a Florida state court had ruled that the Florida family court was able to decide the merit of motion related with temporary custody by Lazaro Gonzalez, stating that Eli\u00e1n should stay with the Miami relatives until a further custody hearing. However, Reno declared that the federal courts are responsible for deciding this case, and that the Miami relatives must appeal to the federal court. Here, the objective of Reno was to provide the relatives with a chance to provide \"any information\" they could that would be \"relevant in the decision\". She again emphasized that the INS commissioner had declared that the father speaks for the son, and that his wishes were to have his son returned to him. ==Early life== Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez was born December 6, 1993, to divorced parents. ===Journey to Florida=== The journey from C\u00e1rdenas, Cuba to Florida On November 21, 1999, Gonz\u00e1lez, his mother Elizabeth Brotons Rodr\u00edguez, and twelve others left Cuba on a small aluminum boat with a faulty engine; Gonz\u00e1lez's mother and ten others died in the crossing. Gonz\u00e1lez and the other two survivors floated at sea until they were rescued by two fishermen, who handed them over to the U.S. Coast Guard. Gonz\u00e1lez's cousin Marisleysis said that the boat's motor broke down and they tried in vain to bail out the water with nylon bags, but a storm doomed their efforts. He told her he tried to help get the water out and his mother's boyfriend placed him in an inner tube for safety. \"He said afterwards that he fell asleep and that when he woke up he never saw his mother again\". He said, \"I think she drowned too because she didn't know how to swim\". Nivaldo Fern\u00e1ndez Ferran, one of the three survivors on the boat, said \"Elizabeth protected her son to the end\". According to Ferran, they set out on their trip at 4 am, dragging inflated rubber floats, or inner tubes, in case they needed them. As they encountered bad weather, the boat's engine failed and the craft began to fill with water. After it went under, the passengers clung to the inner tubes in cold water, with waves reaching heights of three to four meters (10 to 13 feet). Afterwards, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) released Gonz\u00e1lez to his paternal great-uncle, L\u00e1zaro. According to the Washington Post, Gonz\u00e1lez's father, Juan Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez Quintana, had telephoned L\u00e1zaro from Cuba on November 22, 1999, to advise that Gonz\u00e1lez and his mother had left Cuba without Juan Miguel's knowledge, and to watch for their arrival. ===Custody dispute in the United States=== The U.S. legislation system had enacted the Cuban Adjustment Act in 1966, which sought to provide political asylum for Cubans who fled their country in the hopes of a new life. Under the act, Cuban refugees, without visas, entering the United States were paroled, and after a year could apply for permanent resident status.Cova, A. D. (2015). The Elian Gonzalez case: The world's most watched and politically- charged custody battle that reached the U.S. Supreme Court and determined a presidential election. Harvard Latino Law Review, 18(1), 152\u2013200. The US also issued 20,000 lottery visas every year to Cuban emigrants under the wet foot, dry foot policy. Under this policy, those who reached the mainland were granted asylum, while those who were intercepted at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard were sent back to Cuba. L\u00e1zaro Gonz\u00e1lez, backed by local Cuban Americans, took the position that the boy should remain in the United States and not be returned to his father. Marisleysis Gonz\u00e1lez (L\u00e1zaro's adult daughter) became Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez's caretaker and spokesperson for the paternal relatives. Also, Armando Gutierrez, a local Cuban-American businessman, became a spokesman. At the same time, Juan Miguel, with the support of Cuban authorities, demanded that his son be returned to Cuba. On January 21, 2000, Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez's grandmothers, Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodr\u00edguez, flew from Havana to the United States to seek their grandson's return to Cuba. While they were able to meet with the boy only once at the Miami Beach home of Barry University president Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, they journeyed to Washington and met with congressmen and Attorney General Janet Reno. After nine days of media coverage (during which Republican lawmakers acknowledged they did not have the votes to pass a bill to give Gonz\u00e1lez U.S. citizenship), they returned to Cuba to \"a hero's welcome\". On January 28, the Spanish foreign minister Abel Matutes called for the boy's return to Cuba, stating that international law dictated the return. Meanwhile, the Miami Gonz\u00e1lezes denied allegations that they had offered Juan Miguel a house and a car if he abandoned the action and joined his son in Miami. Juan Miguel was uninterested in emigrating. Through January and February, Juan Miguel sent a number of open letters to the U.S. government\u2014published in, among other places, the Cuban newspaper Granma\u2014demanding the return of his son and refusing the Miami relatives' demands. Chicago-based fathers' rights attorney Jeffery M. Leving spearheaded the amicus brief, which set the foundation of the custody case to reunite Gonz\u00e1lez with his father in Cuba.The Group Who Filed Elian Gonzalez Brief, Supports INS Decision, PR Newswire, January 7, 2000.

Supp. 2d (S.D. Fla. 2000) (No. 00-0206). On March 21, Judge Kevin Michael Moore of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida dismissed the relatives' petition for asylum which they had filed on behalf of Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez. L\u00e1zaro vowed to appeal. On March 29, Miami-Dade County mayor Alex Penelas was joined by 22 other civic leaders in a speech in downtown Miami. Penelas indicated that the municipality would not cooperate with Federal authorities on any repatriation of the boy, and would not lend police assets or any other assistance in taking the boy. On April 14, a video was released in which Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez tells Juan Miguel that he wants to stay in the United States. However, many thought that he had been coached, as a male voice was heard off-camera directing the young boy. In a September 2005 interview with 60 Minutes after being sent back to Cuba, Gonz\u00e1lez stated that during his stay in the U.S., his family members were \"telling me bad things about [my father]\", and \"were also telling me to tell him that I did not want to go back to Cuba, and I always told them I wanted to.\" Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez remained a subject of media attention as he went to Walt Disney World Resort one day, then met with politicians the next. Throughout the custody battle, opinion polls showed that a majority of Americans believed Gonz\u00e1lez should be returned to his father in Cuba, and that doing so was in the boy's best interest. Attorney General Janet Reno ordered the return of Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez to his father and set a deadline of April 13, 2000, but the Miami relatives defied the order. Negotiations continued for several days as the house was surrounded by protesters as well as police. The relatives insisted on guarantees that they could live with the child for several months and retain custody, and that Gonz\u00e1lez would not be returned to Cuba. Negotiations carried on throughout the night, but Reno claimed that the relatives rejected all workable solutions. On April 19, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta ruled that Gonz\u00e1lez must remain in the U.S. until the Miami Gonz\u00e1lezes could appeal for an asylum hearing in May. A Florida family court judge revoked L\u00e1zaro's temporary custody, clearing the way for Gonz\u00e1lez to be returned to his father's custody. On April 20, Reno made the decision to remove Gonz\u00e1lez from the house and instructed law enforcement officials to determine the best time to obtain the boy. After being informed of the decision, Marisleysis said to a Justice Department community relations officer, \"You think we just have cameras in the house? If people try to come in, they could be hurt.\" ===Seizure and reactions=== A federal agent retrieves Eli\u00e1n from his relatives' home in Miami. This photo won the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News. In the pre-dawn hours of Easter Eve, April 22, agents of the Border Patrol's special BORTAC unit as part of an operation in which more than 130 INS personnel took part (See awards to INS for bravery) approached the house, knocked on the door, and identified themselves. When no one responded, they entered. At the same time, pepper-spray and mace were employed against persons outside who attempted to interfere. In the confusion, Armando Gutierrez called in Alan Diaz, of the Associated Press, to enter the house and entered a room with Gonz\u00e1lez, his great uncle's wife Angela L\u00e1zaro, her niece, the niece's young son, and Donato Dalrymple (one of the two men who had rescued him from the ocean). They waited in the room listening to agents searching the house. Diaz took a widely publicized photograph of a border patrol agent confronting Dalrymple and the boy. INS also stated in the days after the raid that they had identified as many as two dozen persons who were \"prepared to thwart any government operation\", some of whom had concealed weapons while others had criminal records. Approximately 100 people protested against the raid as it took place, with some calling the INS agents \"assassins\". Then-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani described Border Patrol BORTAC agents involved in the seizure of Elian as \"storm troopers\" at least six times. Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association reacted with \"strong disgust and dismay\" to the Nazi imagery and demanded Giuliani's apology. Hillary Clinton, then running against Giuliani for a Senate seat, agreed with FLEOA in asking for an apology. He refused to apologize, though stated his criticism was aimed at Bill Clinton and AG Janet Reno. Giuliani withdrew from the race for unrelated reasons. Public opinion about the INS raid on the Miami Gonz\u00e1lez's house was widely polarized. There were two major focuses in media coverage of the event: the raid and the family reunions. A Time magazine issue showed a photo of a joyful Gonz\u00e1lez being reunited with his father (the caption says \"Papa!\"), while Newsweek ran an issue that focused on the raid, entitled \"Seizing Eli\u00e1n\". ===Return to father's custody=== Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez poses with his father, stepmother and half-brother in a photo taken a few hours after their reunion at Andrews Air Force Base. Four hours after he was taken from the house in Miami, Gonz\u00e1lez and his father were reunited at Andrews Air Force Base. The next day, the White House released a photograph showing a smiling Gonz\u00e1lez reunited with his father, which the Miami relatives disputed by claiming that it was a fake Gonz\u00e1lez in the photograph. Later, Gonz\u00e1lez and his family were taken to the Aspen Institute Wye River Conference Center in Maryland (formerly known as \"Wye Plantation\"). The media were barred from access to the family. While the family was still at Andrews, New Hampshire senator Bob Smith, escorting the Miami Gonz\u00e1lez relatives, was turned away from the base by guards. The May 5, 2000, Miami Herald reported that Gonz\u00e1lez was joined by his classmates (without their parents) and his teacher from his hometown, C\u00e1rdenas. The newspaper Granma released pictures of Eli\u00e1n in the Young Pioneer uniform of Cuba's Communist youth league. On May 6, 2000, attorney Greg Craig took Gonz\u00e1lez and Juan Miguel to a dinner in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, DC, hosted by Smith and Elizabeth Bagley. After Gonz\u00e1lez was returned to his father's custody, he remained in the U.S. while the Miami relatives exhausted their legal options. A three- judge federal panel had ruled that he could not go back to Cuba until he was granted an asylum hearing, but the case turned on the right of the relatives to request that hearing on behalf of the boy. On June 1, 2000, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Eli\u00e1n was too young to file for asylum; only his father could speak for him, and the relatives lacked legal standing. On June 28, 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the decision. In the afternoon of the same day, seven months and one week after Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez left Cuba, he and his family, along with his classmates and teacher, boarded two chartered planes at Dulles International Airport in Dulles, Virginia, for Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport in Havana. ===Political ramifications=== Commentators have suggested that the Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez affair may have been a factor in voters' decisions in the 2000 United States presidential election, which could have affected the close outcome in Florida. Al Gore's handling of the matter may have angered the predominantly Republican Cuban community over the boy's return to Cuba. Gore initially supported Republican legislation to give the boy and his father permanent residence status,1\\.

After his return to Cuba, Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez lived with his father, stepmother, and three brothers in C\u00e1rdenas, where his father, Juan Miguel, was a waiter at an Italian restaurant at Josone Park, in Varadero, near C\u00e1rdenas. Eli\u00e1n's father was interviewed at the restaurant in 2004 by Keith Morrison of the NBC News program Dateline NBC and Cover to Cover on CNBC. Juan Miguel filmed a home video on which Gonz\u00e1lez was shown doing his arithmetic homework with Juan Miguel in their dining room, going to bed in his bedroom with his two younger half-brothers, and attending karate lessons. Morrison's TV report also showed an 18th-century building in C\u00e1rdenas which was previously used as a fire station and which was renovated and inaugurated on July 14, 2001, as a museum, called Museo de la Batalla de Ideas (\"Museum of the Battle of Ideas\"), which includes an exhibition room dedicated to Gonz\u00e1lez, which houses a life-size bronze statue of Gonz\u00e1lez raising a clenched fist. The former Gonz\u00e1lez home in Miami has similarly been turned into a museum, with the boy's bedroom left unaltered. Juan Miguel is also a member of the National Assembly and has attended events for the Communist Party of Cuba with Gonz\u00e1lez, who has been called up to the stage to meet Fidel Castro. Castro also attended a filmed birthday party of Gonz\u00e1lez with his schoolmates. In September 2005, Gonz\u00e1lez was interviewed by 60 Minutes and stated during the interview that Fidel Castro was a friend, and that he considers Castro \"not only as a friend but as a father\"; Gonz\u00e1lez's aunt, Angela Gonz\u00e1lez, said she doubted whether the interview represented his true beliefs because of the controls imposed by Cuba on information. In December 2006, an ill Fidel Castro was unable to attend Gonz\u00e1lez's 13th birthday celebration, so his brother Ra\u00fal attended instead. On August 16, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of an excessive force lawsuit brought by Dalrymple and others against the federal government and Reno. Gonz\u00e1lez joined the Young Communist Union of Cuba in June 2008 shortly after graduating from junior high school. At age 15, he began military school. In a November 2013 speech, Gonz\u00e1lez described his time in the United States as \"very sad times for me, which marked me for my whole life\", asserting that the Cuban Adjustment Act led to the denial of his rights, including \"the right to be together with my father, the right to keep my nationality and to remain in my cultural context\". === College and career === In 2015, Gonz\u00e1lez was studying to be an industrial engineer, and hoped to marry his high school sweetheart and fianc\u00e9e after finishing college. He stated that although he did not regret returning to Cuba, he would like to travel to the United States one day \"to give my love to the American people\". In July 2016, he received a degree in industrial engineering from the University of Matanzas, and read a letter to Fidel Castro from his graduating class, vowing \"to fight from whatever trench the revolution demands\". After graduating in 2016, Gonz\u00e1lez began working as a technology specialist at a state-run company that makes large plastic water tanks. On Father's Day in 2020, Gonz\u00e1lez announced that he was becoming a father himself, with his fianc\u00e9e being pregnant with a girl. ==Depictions in film and television== The saga was portrayed in the 2000 television film, A Family In Crisis: The Elian Gonzales Story, which starred Esai Morales as Eli\u00e1n's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez; Laura Harring as Eli\u00e1n's cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez; and Alec Roberts in the title role. Eli\u00e1n is a 2017 documentary film directed by Ross McDonnell and Tim Golden, produced by Trevor Birney and executive produced by Alex Gibney. The film details the story of the young Cuban and has exclusive interviews with Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez and his family in both Cuba and Miami. The film was co-produced by Fine Point Films and Jigsaw Productions and has a voiceover by Raul Esparza. The film premiered on April 19, 2017, at the Tribeca Film Festival. It opened in limited release in May, and appeared on CNN Films in August 2017. ==See also== * Cuban exile * Cuba\u2013United States relations * Operation Peter Pan (1960\u20131962) * Parental rights * Yossele Schumacher affair, a similar occurrence * Polovchak v.
