    "text": "An election to Cavan County Council took place on 27 June 1991 as part of that year's Irish local elections. 25 councillors were elected from four electoral divisions by PR-STV voting for a five-year term of office. The Cavan Road Action Group won four seats; not a registered political party, it was a single-issue pressure group focused on the poor state of the surfaces of Cavan's local roads. ==Results by party== {| class=wikitable ! colspan=2 align=center|Party ! valign=top|Seats ! valign=top|\u00b1 ! valign=top|First Pref. votes ! valign=top|FPv% ! valign=top|\u00b1% |- | align=right|11 | align=right|-3 | align=right|11,312 | align=right|42.8 | align=right| |- | align=right|9 | align=right|-1 | align=right|9,393 | align=right|35.5 | align=right| |- | | Cavan Road Action Group | align=right|4 | align=right|+4 | align=right|3,694 | align=right|14.0 | align=right|+14.0 |- | align=right|1 | align=right|0 | align=right|1,045 | align=right|3.9 | align=right| |- | colspan=2 align=center|Totals | align=right |25 | align=center|- | align=right |26,456 | align=center|100 | align=center|\u2014 |} ==Results by Electoral Area== ===Bailieborough=== ===Ballyjamesduff=== ===Belturbet=== ===Cavan=== ==References== ==External links== * Official website * Irishelectionliterature Category:1991 Irish local elections 1991 ",
