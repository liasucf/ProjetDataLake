The annual Army\u2013Navy Game was played on November 26, 1910, at Franklin Field in Philadelphia. After initially missing seven attempts at field goal, Navy won by a 3 to 0 score on a kick by Jack Dalton. Two players from the 1910 Navy team received first-team honors on the 1910 College Football All-America Team. Guard John Brown received first- team honors from The New York Sun, New York Herald, and Pittsburgh Leader. Jack Dalton received first-team honors from The New York Times. Brown and Dalton were both later inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. The 1910 season was Navy's third with Lt. Frank D. Berrien as head coach. Despite the undefeated season, the Navy announced on December 2 that Berrien would be assigned to duties outside the Naval Academy and would not return as the head football coach for 1911. At the end of the 1910 season, Jack Dalton, the halfback who scored Navy's only points against Army, was selected to serve as captain of the 1911 team. ==Schedule== ==References== Navy Category:Navy Midshipmen football seasons Navy Midshipmen Category:College football undefeated seasons ",
