    "text": "This is a list of operas by Argentine composers. Argentina's first native born opera composer was Francisco Hargreaves (1849\u20131900) who composed La gatta bianca (1875) and Los estudiantes de Bologna (1897), followed by Zen\u00f3n Rol\u00f3n (1856\u20131902) who composed several operas as well as operettas and zarzuelas.Apel, Willi (ed.), \"Argentina\", Harvard Dictionary of Music] 2nd edition, Harvard University Press, 1969, p. 49. The works of many of the composers from this generation were first performed outside Argentina. Native Argentine opera was to develop much more with the massive European (mainly Italian) immigration in the late 19th century and even more with the opening of the Teatro Col\u00f3n in 1908 where most of the 20th century operas listed here had their world premieres. Some of the first operas to treat Argentine subjects or national themes were Arturo Berutti's Pampa (1897) based on the life of Juan Moreira and Yupanki (1899) based on the life of Inca warrior Manqu Inka Yupanki. Also notable in this genre were Felipe Boero's Tucum\u00e1n (1918) set during the Battle of Tucum\u00e1n and El matrero (1929). Considered by many to be the quintessential Argentine opera, El matrero had a libretto based on gaucho folk tradition and incorporated Argentine folk melodies and a traditional gaucho dance. The Spanish playwright Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca was also the inspiration for several Argentine operas. His plays, La zapatera prodigiosa and Bodas de sangre, were the basis of operas by Juan Jos\u00e9 Castro, while Osvaldo Golijov's 2003 opera Ainadamar is based on events in the playwright's life. ==List== ===19th century=== *Il fidanzato del mare by H\u00e9ctor Panizza; opera in one act to a libretto by Romeo Carugati; premiered 15 August 1897, Teatro de la \u00d3pera, Buenos Aires ===20th century=== H\u00e9ctor Panizza (1875-1967) *Medioevo latino by H\u00e9ctor Panizza; opera (triptych) in three acts to a libretto by Luigi Illica; premiered 17 November 1900, Teatro Politeama Genovese, Genoa *Aurora by H\u00e9ctor Panizza; opera in three acts to a libretto by Luigi Illica after Hector Quesada; premiered 5 September 1908, Teatro Col\u00f3n, Buenos Aires (revised version in Spanish premiered 1945) *Tucum\u00e1n by Felipe Boero; opera in one act to a libretto by Leopoldo D\u00edaz; premiered 29 June 1918, Teatro Col\u00f3n, Buenos Aires *Ariana y Dionysos by Felipe Boero; opera in one act to a libretto by Leopoldo D\u00edaz; premiered 7 August 1920, Teatro Col\u00f3n, Buenos Aires *Raquela by Felipe Boero; opera in one act to a libretto by V\u00edctor Mercadante; premiered 26 June 1923, Teatro Col\u00f3n, Buenos Aires *Las Bacantes by Felipe Boero; opera in three acts to a libretto after Euripides, translated by Leopoldo Longhi; premiered 19 September 1925, Teatro Col\u00f3n, Buenos Aires *El matrero by Felipe Boero; opera in three acts to a libretto by Yamand\u00fa Rodr\u00edguez; premiered 12 July 1929, Teatro Col\u00f3n, Buenos Aires *Siripo by Felipe Boero; opera in three acts to a libretto by Luis Bay\u00f3n-Herrera, after Manuel de Lavard\u00e9n; premiered 8 June 1937, Teatro Col\u00f3n, Buenos Aires * Chasca by Enrique Mario Casella, opera in one act, libretto by the composer; premiered 28 August 1939, Teatro Alberdi, Tucum\u00e1n *Bizancio by H\u00e9ctor Panizza; opera (poema dram\u00e1tico) in three acts to a libretto by Gustavo Macchi after Auguste Bailly, premiered 25 July 1939, Teatro Col\u00f3n, Buenos Aires Buenos Aires *La zapatera prodigosa by Juan Jos\u00e9 Castro; opera in three acts after Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca; premiered 1943, UruguayPuig, Barrett and Campodonico, Cesar, \"Uruguay\", World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: The Americas, Taylor and Francis, 2000, p. 495. *Proserpina y el extranjero by Juan Jos\u00e9 Castro; opera in three acts after Omar del Carlo; premiered 17 March 1952, La Scala, MilanRandel, Don Michael (ed.), \"Castro, Juan Jos\u00e9\", The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music, Harvard University Press, 1996, p. 144. *Zincal\u00ed by Felipe Boero; opera in three acts to a libretto by Arturo Capdevila; premiered 12 November 1954, Teatro Col\u00f3n, Buenos Aires *Bodas di sangre by Juan Jos\u00e9 Castro; opera in three acts after Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca; premiered 9 August 1956, Teatro Col\u00f3n, Buenos AiresPlate, Leonor, \u00d3peras, Teatro Col\u00f3n: Esperando el centenario, Editorial Dunken, 2006, p. 84. *Don Rodrigo by Alberto Ginastera; opera in three acts to a libretto by Alejandro Casona; premiered 24 July 1964, Teatro Col\u00f3n, Buenos Aires *Bomarzo by Alberto Ginastera; opera in two acts to a libretto by Manuel Mujica L\u00e1inez; premiered 19 May 1967, Washington, D.C. *Mar\u00eda de Buenos Aires by \u00c1stor Piazzolla; opera (tango operita) to a libretto by Horacio Ferrer; premiered May 1968, Sala Planeta, Buenos AiresZinger, Pablo, \"A Composer Defying Categories\", New York Times, 4 october 1998 *Beatrix Cenci by Alberto Ginastera; opera in two acts to libretto by the composer, William Shand, and A.
