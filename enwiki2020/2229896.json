    "text": "E. Von Dahl Killed the Locals is the debut studio album by pop punk group The Matches. It was originally self-released in 2003 and later re-released on May 11, 2004 via Epitaph Records. The self-release contained the track \"Superman\" which was removed from the Epitaph re-release because the band felt it would be a good bonus to those fans who had been with them from the beginning. The versions of \"Scratched Out\" and \"The Jack Slap Cheer\" that appear on the Epitaph Records version each have changed lyrics due, in both cases, to copyright liability. The Epitaph re-release contained two new tracks, \"Borderline Creep\" and \"More Than Local Boys\" although \"Superman\" was removed and \"Scratched Out\" was renamed as \"Track 11\". The album title is a reference to the band's legal battle with Yvonne Doll and their subsequent name change from The Locals to The Matches. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== The following credits are presented for the original 2003 release, adapted from Discogs *Shawn Harris \u2013 lyrics, vocals, guitar, artwork *Justin San Souci \u2013 lyrics (track 10), vocals, bass, artwork *Jonathan Devoto \u2013 vocals, guitar *Matt Whalen \u2013 drums *Mike Harwood \u2013 lyrics *Matt Esposito \u2013 lyrics (tracks: 3, 5, 8) *Vanessa Harris \u2013 vocals (track 11) *Rene Carranza \u2013 synthesizer, percussion & keyboards (track 11) *Mo Juanson \u2013 blues harp (track 9) *Mike Green \u2013 additional guitar (track 4), engineering (tracks: 1, 2, 10), additional producer (track 2), producer & recording (tracks: 3-6, 8, 11) *Matt Radosevich \u2013 producer & recording (tracks: 1, 2, 7, 9, 10) *Alex Studer \u2013 engineering (track 4) *Miles Hurwitz \u2013 producer, management *Mark Chalecki \u2013 mastering *Gene Grimaldi \u2013 mastering (for Epitaph re-release only) *Joe Barresi \u2013 producer & mixing (for Epitaph re-release only) == Release history == {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! scope=\"col\" |Region ! scope=\"col\" |Date ! scope=\"col\" |Format(s) ! scope=\"col\" |Label(s) |- ! scope=\"row\" |United States |2003 | |Self-released |- ! scope=\"row\" |Europe |May 10, 2004 | rowspan=\"2\" | | rowspan=\"2\" |Epitaph Records |- ! scope=\"row\" |United States |May 11, 2004 |} ==References== == External links == * Category:2003 debut albums Category:The Matches albums Category:Self-released albums Category:Epitaph Records albums Category:Albums produced by Mike Green (record producer) ",
