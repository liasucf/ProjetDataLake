    "text": "The Border Network for Human Rights (BNHR) is a nonprofit group based in El Paso, Texas, that advocates for immigration reform and human rights. The organization also documents cases of the abuse of immigrants at the hands of United States Government authorities. Efforts by BNHR to systematically document and report abuse of immigrants has led to fewer incidents in the El Paso area, according to the group. BNHR is working to make their approach a national model for reform. == Background == Cases of abuse and misconduct between United States authorities and persons subject to their authority near the border is \"pervasive,\" according to the Immigration Policy Center. Cases have been reported that customs officers have committed acts of verbal and physical abuse at the United States-Mexico border. Cases described as \"hate crimes\" against illegal immigrants by the Los Angeles Times, have occurred at the border and been allegedly committed by Border Patrol agents. In addition, many agents who have committed acts of abuse against people crossing at the border are often not disciplined. == About == Suzan Kern was one of the first coordinators of the group, which was first known as the Border Rights Coalition (BRC). It was created in the early 1990s by lawyers, civil rights activists, and church groups in El Paso. The group began documenting alleged cases of abuse carried out by Border Patrol, U.S. Customs, and other immigration law enforcement agencies in the area. BRC was also active in protesting the treatment of immigrants. The name was changed to Border Network for Human Rights (BNHR) in 2001. After the election of Donald Trump, BNHR along with the Reform Immigration for Texas group created educational forums for immigrants to fully understand their Constitutional rights. == References == == External links == * Official site Category:Human rights organizations based in the United States Category:Immigrant rights organizations in the United States ",
