    "text": "The 1931 College Football All-Southern Team consists of American football players selected to the College Football All-Southern Teams selected by various organizations for the 1931 Southern Conference football season. Tulane won the Southern Conference championship. In December 2008, Sports Illustrated undertook to identify the individuals who would have been awarded the Heisman Trophy in college football's early years, before the trophy was established. Tulane's Jerry Dalrymple was selected as the would-be Heisman winner for the 1931 season. ==Composite eleven== The All-Southern eleven compiled by the Associated Press included: *Johnny Cain, fullback for Alabama, All-American and later a coach. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1973. *Jerry Dalrymple, end for Tulane. One article which attempts to retroactively name Heisman Trophy winners before 1934 named Dalrymple as the recipient for 1931. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1954. *Austin Downes, quarterback and captain for Georgia. *Pete Gracey, center for Vanderbilt. *Herman Hickman, guard for Tennessee, All- American. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1959. *Tex Leyendecker, tackle for Vanderbilt, later played for the inaugural Philadelphia Eagles season. *Gene McEver, halfback for Tennessee, inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1954. *John Scafide, guard for Tulane *Vernon \"Catfish\" Smith, end for Georgia, made an all-time Georgia Bulldogs football team picked in 1935. *Ray Saunders, tackle for Tennessee, third-team All-American. *Don Zimmerman, halfback for Tulane.
