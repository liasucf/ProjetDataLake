    "text": "The 1969\u201370 Carolina Cougars season was the 1st season of the Cougars in the ABA. Late in the spring of 1969, the Houston Mavericks had been bought by the Southern Sports Corporation (headed by James C. Gardner) for $350,000. After the season finished, the team moved to North Carolina, which at the time had no professional teams. The Cougars played in three areas in the state: Greensboro, Charlotte, and Raleigh, making this the first regional franchise in the ABA. The first game of the Cougars was on October 8, 1969, when the Cougars played the Dallas Chaparrals at Greensboro Coliseum, with Carolina winning 108\u201397. The team finished 3rd in the six team Eastern Division. While they finished last in average points scored per game (106.8), they were 1st in points allowed per game (107). In the Playoffs, the Cougars faced off against the Indiana Pacers (with Game 3 being played in Charlotte and Game 4 played in Raleigh), but the Cougars lost the series in four games. ==Roster== * 42 Bill Bunting - Small forward * 24 Calvin Fowler - Shooting guard * 33 Steve Kramer - Shooting guard * 23 Gene Littles - Point guard * 35 Randolph Mahaffey - Power forward * 44 Larry Miller - Shooting guard * 34 Doug Moe - Small forward * 52 Rich Niemann - Center * 51 George Peeples - Center * 21 Ron Perry - Guard * 52 George Sutor - Center * 11 Bob Verga - Shooting guard * 13 Hank Whitney - Power forward ==Final standings== ===Eastern Division=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" width=\"470\" ! width=\"30%\"|Eastern Division ! width=\"5%\"|W ! width=\"5%\"|L ! width=\"5%\"|PCT ! width=\"7.5%\"|GB |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\"|Indiana Pacers *||59||25||.702 | - |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\"|Kentucky Colonels *|||45||39||.536||14.0 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\"|Carolina Cougars *||42||42||.500||17.0 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\"|New York Nets * ||39 || 45 ||.464 ||20.0 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\"|Pittsburgh Pipers ||29 ||55 ||.345 ||30.0 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\"|Miami Floridians ||23 ||61 ||.274 ||36.0 |} ==Playoffs== Eastern Division Semifinals vs Carolina Cougarshttp://www.remembertheaba.com/PlayoffPages/1970Playoffs.html {|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"80%\" |- align=\"center\" style=\"background:#DC143C;color:#7BAFD4;\" | Game || Date || Location || Result || Record|| Attendance |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" | 1 ||April 18 || Indiana || 105\u2013123 || 0\u20131 || 6,123 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" | 2 || April 19|| Indiana || 98\u2013103 || 0\u20132 || 6,341 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" | 3 || April 22|| Carolina || 98\u2013103 || 0\u20133 ||3,381 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" | 4 || April 24|| Carolina || 106\u2013110 || 0\u20134 ||5,211 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |} Cougars lose series, 4\u20130 ==Awards, records, and honors== 1970 ABA All-Star Game played on January 24, 1970 * Doug Moe * Bob Verga * Darel Carrier ==References== * Cougars on Basketball Reference Carolina Category:Carolina Cougars Carolina Cougars, 1969-70 Carolina Cougars, 1969-70 ",
