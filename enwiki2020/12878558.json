    "text": "\"Listen To Your Heartbeat\" (Original Swedish title: \"Lyssna till ditt hj\u00e4rta\") was the Swedish entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 2001. Friends greatly resembled former Swedish Eurovision winners, ABBA. The group comprised two female singers, a blonde and a brunette, a male pianist, two male guitarists and a female backing singer. The blonde singer, Nina Inhammar, sported a red jacket and trousers over a sparkly beige top, and a brown belt decorated with diamond studs. The brunette, Kim K\u00e4rnfalk, sported an off-the-shoulder white top, and dark red leather trousers, with a black belt. \"Listen To Your Heartbeat\" became part of a controversy after it was claimed that it was plagiarised from Belgium's 1996 entry \"Liefde is een kaartspel\". At first this was denied by the Swedish composers, Thomas G:son and Henrik Sethsson, but after the Belgian songwriters and the author's organisation SABAM pressed for legal action, a cash settlement was agreed.ESCtoday.com, Swedish entry 2001 now officially plagiarismLeif Thorsson.
