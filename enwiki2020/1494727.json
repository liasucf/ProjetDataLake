    "text": "Henry Peter Gyrich () is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is a liaison of the United States government who is against the superhuman community. ==Publication history== The character first appeared in Avengers Vol. 1 #165 (November 1977) and was created by Jim Shooter (writer) and John Byrne (penciller). ==Fictional character biography== Henry Gyrich is the first person to be given the title of US Government liaison to the Avengers by the National Security Agency later by the National Security Council. With his status, Gyrich is one of only two people (the other being the President of the United States) who could affect the Avengers in many difficult ways. During his tenure, Gyrich revokes the Avengers' priority status after taking issue.Avengers #168 (February 1978) The Avengers have to accept Gyrich's \"suggestions\" or have their Quinjets and other sensitive equipment confiscated.Avengers #181 (July 1979) He limits the Avengers' active membership to seven members, forces the Falcon to join unwillingly to fill an affirmative action quota Gyrich sets, and installs various security measures for the teamAvengers #181 (July 1979) Gyrich oversees the Avengers' activities for the next several months without incident, until he forbids the team to go on a mission to help Quicksilver.Avengers #186 (August 1979) The next incident involves a security leak. Gyrich takes part in a Senate investigation involving the Avengers which claims the team are national security threats. When the investigation ends, the Senate committee gives the Avengers new guidelines to follow, and the committee designates Raymond Sikorski as his successor. Writer Peter David has indicated that Shooter based Gyrich on himself. David attempted to humanize Peter by giving a backstory which touched upon Gyrich's family life. After Betty Banner criticizes Gyrich for appearing callous and unfeeling when mentioning the pain of Thunderbolt Ross dying, Gyrich cuts Banner off, saying \"My father died of Alzheimer's, [Betty]. I took a year's leave to care for him so he wouldn't be watched over by strangers that my crummy salary couldn't even afford. I cleaned up after him, tended to him, and his last words as I cradled his dying body were, 'Who in heck are you?'\";The Incredible Hulk (vol. 2) #456 (August 1997)\"Q&A;\" entry on David's blog; April 14, 2007 (The information on this point is in the April 16, 2005, 9:31 a.m. post.) Avengers: The Initiative later revealed that Gyrich's greatest fear is contracting the same disease that killed his father.Avengers: The Initiative #5 Prior to his involvement with the Avengers, Gyrich was NSA Liaison to Canada's Department H. While there, he met and had repeated issues with Canada's chief agent Wolverine. Gyrich becomes a member of the Commission of Superhuman Activities (CSA), the oversight body on superhuman activities in the United States; he's part of the team that forces Captain America to resign. Gyrich also takes part as a special consultant in a covert government designed to deal with the problems concerning mutants in the United States. The project is instrumental in creating a mutant team to counter the foreign mutants threat. ===Dire Wraith=== Henry Gyrich is later involved in war efforts against the Dire Wraith extraterrestrials. This time, he works alongside the mutant Forge who works as a weapons maker for the US government and S.H.I.E.L.D. Gyrich takes Forge's specially designed superhuman power-neutralizing gun to capture the mutant Rogue for breaking into a facility S.H.I.E.L.D. In an encounter with Rogue, Storm and government forces, Gyrich accidentally shoots Storm and his specialized weapon strips Storm's powers and abilities as a mutant (but Storm's powers return some time later). Gyrich continues attempting to use Forge's own version of Spaceknight Rom's Neutralizer, planning to use an orbital version to wipe out all superpowers on Earth. Rom and Forge stop him, however, and he can only watch while tied up as Rom banishes Wraithworld (the Dire Wraith's home world) instead of destroying all the heroes and villains. Gyrich is also involved in hunting the Hulk after Onslaught's events. ===Hunted by others=== Henry Gyrich is targeted for assassination by the current form of the Mutant Liberation Front (MLF), led by the energy-casting Reignfire. His lack of gratitude for being rescued is part of what led the mutant Feral to defect from X-Force to the MLF.X-Force Vol. 1 #27\u201328 (October\u2013November 1993) Gyrich is a key player in Bastion's program. He is a faithful believer in the operation until he himself becomes a target of Prime Sentinels. After being rescued by Spider-Man, Marrow and Callisto, Gyrich demands the program be shut down. ===Political exploits=== Gyrich is promoted to be Valerie Cooper's successor as the CSA's head. While there, Baron Strucker secretly places Gyrich under the control of nanites. Gyrich uses Commission resources and remolds the vigilante Nomad into the assassin Scourge and attempts to live out his \"fantasy\" of killing all the world's superhumans, before being stopped by the Thunderbolts. Following that incident, he's reassigned to the US State Department and is made the Black Panther's liaison as well as the Avengers' new liaison to the United Nations (by Captain America's suggestion). During this time, he redeems himself in the eyes of the team when he refuses to deliver information on the Avengers to the Red Skull (disguised as the Secretary of Defense Dell Rusk). He never breaks, even under severe torture, which impressed the others. Now a faithful liaison officer to the Avengers, Gyrich's job comes to an end after the United Nations' relationship with the Avengers ends.Avengers Disassembled Following the Civil War storyline, Gyrich is the Secretary of the Superhuman Armed Forces. His base of operations is the superhuman training facility in Stamford, Connecticut. It is under his orders that the Gauntlet is drafted as the facility's drill instructor. This comes after Gauntlet saves him from an attack by HYDRA in Iraq.Avengers: The Initiative #1 (April 2007) Gyrich gives orders to cover up MVP's death. He makes arrangements to provide a special tutor to Trauma through Hank McCoy;Avengers: The Initiative #2 (May 2007) the tutor is revealed to be depowered mutant Dani Moonstar.Avengers: The Initiative #3 They don't get along well and Gyrich fires Moonstar for training Trauma to use powers to help people with debilitating phobias instead of using these abilities as a weapon. After KIA's debacle, Gyrich had to deal with an inquiry involving the Initiative program, getting into a heated argument with Iron Man where Gyrich says to Iron Man, \"you've got Captain America's blood on your hands!\". Apparently fired from his position after this, he later makes a statement claiming at a press conference that he had decided to \"retire\" to spend time with his family. When a reporter points out that Gyrich has no living family, he declines to elaborate.Avengers: The Initiative #12 Gyrich becomes the main antagonist for Kieron Gillen's and Steven Sander's new series S.W.O.R.D. where he joins S.W.O.R.D. (Sentient World Observation and Response Department) under Norman Osborn's orders and becomes the co-leader alongside Abigail Brand. In the first volume, Gyrich manages to kidnap several notable aliens including Noh-Varr, Adam X, Jazinda, Karolina Dean and Hepzibah, all in his desire to send aliens home. He also arrests both Brand and Lockheed.S.W.O.R.D. #2 Gyrich survives an alien takeover of the installation simply by being too dosed on intruder-neutralization gas to be much of a threat. Brand, with the assistance of several super-powered beings, takes back the job and blackmails Gyrich into leaving S.W.O.R.D. alone.S.W.O.R.D. Volume 1: No Time To Breathe (120 pages, July 2010, ) (2010) While it is unknown if he was brainwashed by HYDRA or it was by his own will, Gyrich worked along HYDRA to control Dennis Dunphy and turn into the new Scourge in order to kill criminals and \"fix the system\".

Gyrich attempts to do so by disguising himself as Captain America and hiding agitators in the crowd; he manages to approach Mary and stab critically before he gets his hand broken by the Thing. But his plan severely backfires when Mary uses healing powers to quell the outbreaking violence amongst the crowd and, after making a full recovery, subsequently instigates the dissolution of the existing government system.
