    "text": "Skidoo is an album by Harry Nilsson. It is the original soundtrack recording for the 1968 Otto Preminger film Skidoo, arranged and conducted by George Tipton and released by RCA Records. Track 1, \"The Cast and Crew\", was used at the close of the film, and consists of Nilsson putting the entire end credits (key grip, Paramount logo, and copyright notice and all) to music and singing them. Preminger gave Nilsson a cameo role in the film as a prison guard. The album's liner notes are by radio disc jockey and voice artist Gary Owens. ==Track listing== All music and lyrics by Harry Nilsson. #\"The Cast and Crew\" (vocal HN) \u2013 3:55 #\"I Will Take You There\" (vocal HN) \u2013 2:30 #\"SKIDOO\"/\"Commercials\" \u2013 1:23 #\"Goodnight Mr. Banks\"/\"Let's get the hardware\"/\"Murder in the car wash\" \u2013 2:45 #\"Angie's Suite\" \u2013 4:20 #\"The Tree\" \u2013 2:49 #\"Garbage Can Ballet\" (vocal HN) \u2013 2:00 #\"Tony's Trip\" \u2013 4:19 #\"Escape:Impossible\"/\"Green Bay Packers March\" \u2013 3:38 #\"Man Wasn't Meant to Fly\" \u2013 2:12 #\"Escape:Possible\" \u2013 2:15 #\"SKIDOO\" (vocal Carol Channing)/\"Goodnight Mr. Banks\" \u2013 4:08 Category:Harry Nilsson albums Category:1968 soundtrack albums Category:RCA Victor soundtracks Category:Albums produced by Rick Jarrard Category:Albums arranged by George Tipton Category:Comedy film soundtracks ",
