    "text": "Stefan Brankovi\u0107 (; c. 1417 \u2013 9 October 1476), also known in historiography as Stefan the Blind (\u0421\u0442\u0435\u0444\u0430\u043d \u0421\u043b\u0435\u043f\u0438), was briefly the despot (ruler) of the Serbian Despotate between 1458 and 1459, member of the Brankovi\u0107 dynasty. ==Family== Stefan and his relations are named in Dell'Imperadori Constantinopolitani (also known as the \"Massarelli manuscript\" after the work was found in papers of Angelo Massarelli, the general secretary of the Council of Trent\"The Archives: the past & the present\", section \"The Council of Trent\" ), a manuscript held in the Vatican Library.Tony Hoskins, \"Anglocentric medieval genealogy\" This manuscript names him a son of \u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107 and Eirene Kantakouzene. D. M. Nicol (1994) questioned his maternity, suggesting \u0110ura\u0111 had a prior marriage to a daughter of John IV of Trebizond. However his theory presented no sources and failed to take into account that John IV was born between 1395 and 1417. He would be unlikely to be a grandparent by the 1410s.Cawley, Profile of \u0110ura\u0111 Personal coat of arms On 11 September 1429, \u0110ura\u0111 made a donation to Esphigmenou Monastery at Mount Athos. The charter for the document names his wife Irene and five children. The Masarelli manuscript also names the same five children of \u0110ura\u0111 and Eirene. Other genealogies mention a sixth child, Todor Brankovi\u0107. He could be a child who died young and thus not listed with his siblings. The oldest sibling listed in the Massarelli document was Grgur Brankovi\u0107. The 1429 document mentions him with the title of Despot. Grgur was appointed governor of territories of southern Serbia associated to the House of Brankovi\u0107.Fine (1994), p. He was reportedly appointed by Murad II of the Ottoman Empire in 1439. In April 1441, Grgur was accused of plotting against Murad and his governorship terminated. He was imprisoned in Amasya and blinded on 8 May 1441. Grgur and his brothers co- signed a charter by which \u0110ura\u0111 confirmed the privileges to the Republic of RagusaMiklosich (1858), p. Grgur retired to a monastery under the monastic name \"German\". According to Fine, Grgur resurfaced in 1458, claiming the succession of the vacant throne of Serbia for himself or his son. The Massarelli manuscript mentioned Grgur as unwed. Later genealogies name his wife as \"Jelisaveta\". Vuk Grgurevi\u0107, a son of Grgur, was later a titular Serbian despot (1471\u20131485). He was possibly an illegitimate. The Massarelli next names an older sister of Stefan, Mara Brankovi\u0107. She was one of the wives of Murad II.Cawley, Profile of Mara Stefan himself is listed third. His younger sister is listed as Cantacuzina, the Latinized version of their mother's last name. Later genealogies give her name as Katarina. She married Ulrich II of Celje. The last and youngest sibling listed was Lazar Brankovi\u0107, successor to their father. ==Reign== Serbian Despotate, 1455-1459 According to Nicol, Stefan had become a citizen of the Republic of Venice. He was blinded alongside his brother Grgur in 1441. Both blind brothers seem to have been omitted from considerations as possible heirs to their father. They could only claim the throne in 1458, since the death of Lazar left them the only male representatives of the Brankovi\u0107. According to Fine, Stefan secured the throne by co-operating with his sister-in-law Helena Palaiologina, widow of Lazar. She was a daughter of Thomas Palaiologos, Despot of the Morea, and Catherine Zaccaria of the Principality of Achaea. Helena however arranged the marriage of one of her daughters to Stjepan Toma\u0161evi\u0107, prince of Bosnia. She thus managed to secure the throne for her new son-in-law.Cawley, Profile of Stefan Matthias Corvinus of Hungary and Stjepan Toma\u0161 Kotromani\u0107, King of Bosnia and father of Toma\u0161evi\u0107, dethroned Stefan on April 8, 1459. They enthroned Stjepan Toma\u0161evi\u0107 as his replacement. At the end of 1459 Stefan decided to travel to Albania, where he had relatives. In mid-1460 he travelled to Albania where he married Angelina Arianit Komneni in November 1460. Angelina was the sister of Donika, who married Skanderbeg. Skanderbeg gave to Stefan Brankovi\u0107 an unknown estate as appanage. At the beginning of 1461 Stefan Brankovi\u0107 went to Italy with Skanderbeg's written recommendation. Fenek monastery was founded by Stefan Brankovi\u0107 When Serbian Despotate had been lost to Ottomans, Stefan's son Jovan led Serbian refugees to the Kingdom of Hungary. There Jovan was finally recognized as Serbian Despot, with a principality called Raitzen. ==Marriage and children== In 1461, Stefan married Angjelina Arianit Komneni, daughter of Albanian voivode of Shkod\u00ebr and Durr\u00ebs, Gjergj Arianit Komneni.Cawley, Profile of the Araniti family They had four or five children: *Jovan (d. 10 December 1502).
