According to the legends, while Raja Jagat Deo was going for pilgrimage in Puri from his kingdom in Dhar in modern Madhya Pradesh, his wife gave birth to a son while camping at Jhalda, currently in Purulia district. The king\u2019s entourage believed the child had been born dead, and left him there. Later the child was found by seven local tribal chiefs and was named Damodar Sekhar. It was Damodar Sekhar who established the Panchkot Royal dynasty in 17 century .The Kings were mahto kurmi . Post-independence, when the Indian Parliament subjected the Right to property to certain restrictions and states began to initiate aggressive agrarian reforms by passing laws that abolished the Zamindari system, the family approached the Supreme Court. Subsequently, in 1951, a five-bench-judge unanimously ruled in favor of the government. ==See also== * Jharia Raj ==External links== * ==References== Category:History of West Bengal Category:Purulia district Category:Zamindari estates ",
