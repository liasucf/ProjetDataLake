Hotel Chez Lando Ndasingwa founded the hotel Chez Lando in the 1980s with his Canadian wife H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. Following Ndasingwa's death, the hotel was taken over by his sister Anne-Marie Kantengwa. Educated at the Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Andr\u00e9 of Kigali, the Universit\u00e9 Nationale du Rwanda at Butare, Universit\u00e9 Laval at Quebec City, McGill University, and Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Ndasingwa was a former professor at the Universit\u00e9 Nationale du Rwanda and ethnic Tutsi. As a politician, he was the leader and vice president of the moderate Parti lib\u00e9ral du Rwanda and was granted the portfolio of Minister of Labour and Social Affairs in the Habyarimana transitional government put in place after the Arusha Accords. He was the only Tutsi member of the transitional government. On February 17, 1994, UNAMIR commander Rom\u00e9o Dallaire received information of a plot to assassinate Ndasingwa and Joseph Kavaruganda, both prominent moderate members of the transitional government. In his book Shake Hands with the Devil, Dallaire claims that he informed them of this plot, and neither were surprised. As an outspoken and well-known public figure, Ndasingwa was the frequent target of attacks on propaganda radio station RTLM. On April 7, following Habyarimana's death, Ndasingwa and his Canadian wife, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Pinski, both graduates of the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, were abducted from their house along with their two children, Malaika and Patrick (age 17 and 15), and Ndasingwa's mother by the government's Presidential Guard, despite being under UNAMIR protection. All were subsequently killed. During his final moments, he and his family requested UNAMIR troops for protection as the presidential guard assaulted their home, his final words being \"It's too late.\" https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/evil/interviews/marchal.html One of his sisters, Louise Mushikiwabo, became much later (December 2009) Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation in Paul Kagame's government, and, then (October, 2018), Secretary General of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie.Mushikiwabo's Autobiography on the site crimesofwar.org ==References== ==External links== *Crimes of War Project: One Woman's Quest for Justice Category:1994 deaths Category:Year of birth missing Category:People who died in the Rwandan genocide Category:Rwandan murder victims Category:Government ministers of Rwanda Category:Tutsi people ",
