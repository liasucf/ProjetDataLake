The 1st Chief of the confederation was Tur Ali bin Pehlwan (1340 - 1360 C.E.) followed by his son Qutlugh bin Tur Ali (1360 - 1378/79 C.E.) who formed the Aq Qoyunlu Turkmen Principality. He in turn was followed by his son Qara Yoluq Osman, the founder of Aq Qoyunlu Beylik or State. The dynasty originated around Diyarbak\u0131r and ruled the territory now part of present-day Turkey, Iraq and Iran. Their capital was the city of Tabriz after 1471-1472. They gained international significance under Uzun Hasan who became their greatest leader. He conquered the Qara Qoyunlu and defeated the Timurid Empire thus adding significant portions of Iran to his kingdom but eventually losing to the Ottoman Empire weakening his kingdom which eventually was absorbed into Safavid Iran. ==Aq Qoyunlu rulers== *In letters from the Ottoman Sultans, when addressing the kings of Aq Qoyunlu, such titles as \"Iranian King of Kings\", \"Iranian Sultan of Sultans\", Sh\u00e5hansh\u00e5h Ir\u00e5n Khadiv Ajam \"Shahanshah of Iran and Ruler of Persia\", Jamshid shawkat va Fereydun r\u00e5yat va D\u00e5r\u00e5 der\u00e5yat \"Powerful like Jamshid, flag of Fereydun and wise like Darius\" have been used., pp. 193, 274, 315, 330, 332, 422 and 430.
