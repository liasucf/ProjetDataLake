    "text": "The Mother of Fraternities refers to two colleges: Union College and Miami University, both of which founded many fraternities. Union College was the site in which three fraternities in the United States, Kappa Alpha Society, Sigma Phi Society, and Delta Phi, known collectively as the Union Triad, were founded between 1825 and 1827. Several other early alpha chapters in the Greek system, including Psi Upsilon (1833), Chi Psi (1841), and Theta Delta Chi (1847), were founded at Union as well. The Mother of Fraternities label is also used to refer to Miami University based upon the rise of the Miami Triad: Beta Theta Pi, Phi Delta Theta and Sigma Chi which were founded from 1839 to 1855, during the school's historical period known as \"Old Miami\". After the school became reestablished, the alpha chapters of Delta Zeta (1902) and Phi Kappa Tau (1906) were founded. ==References== Category:Fraternities and sororities in the United States Category:Miami University ",
