After Evolution closed in an exit scam in March 2015, Agora replaced it as the largest darknet market.Andy Greenberg. \"Drug Market \u2018Agora\u2019 Replaces the Silk Road as King of the Dark Net\". Wired, 2 September 2014. In October 2014 to January 2015, the art collective !Mediengruppe Bitnik explored darknet culture in an exhibition in Switzerland entitled The Darknet: From Memes to Onionland, displaying the purchases of the Random Darknet Shopper, an automated online shopping bot which spent $100 in Bitcoins per week on Agora. The aim was to examine philosophical questions surrounding the darknet, such as the legal culpability of a piece of software or robot. The exhibition of the robot's purchases, a landscape of traded goods that included a bag of ten 120 mg Ecstasy pills \"with no bullshit inside\" (containing 90 mg of MDMA), was staged next-door to a police station near Z\u00fcrich.website of !Mediengruppe Bitnik In August 2015 Agora's admins released a PGP signed message announcing a pause of operations to protect the site against potential attacks that they believe might be used to deanonymize server locations: After the closure of Agora, most activity moved over to the darknet market AlphaBay, lasting until its shutdown by law enforcement in July 2017.https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2017/07/21/two-of-the-biggest- dark-web-markets-have-been-shut-down == References == Category:Defunct Tor hidden services Category:Defunct darknet markets Category:Internet properties established in 2013 ",
