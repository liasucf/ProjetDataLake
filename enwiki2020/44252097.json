IPC does not define the word 'obscene', hence it is interpreted differently by different authorities. The Supreme court has noted that \"`obscenity' should be gauged with respect to contemporary community standards\".http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1327342/ The court has also observed that the \u201cstandards of contemporary society in India are\u2026fast changing\u201d in Chandrakant Kalyandas Kakodar vs The State Of Maharashtra 1969.http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25099/ Regarding 'contemporary community standards', the Supreme court has noted that it is not \u201cthe standard of a group of susceptible or sensitive persons\u201d that can be held as the standard of the community, in Aveek Sarkar vs State of West Bengal 2014.http://indiankanoon.org/doc/195958005/ Regarding social morality, the Supreme court has observed that \u201cNotions of social morality are inherently subjective and the criminal law cannot be used as a means to unduly interfere with the domain of personal autonomy\u201d in Khushboo vs Kanniamal 2010. Now with regards to kissing and hugging in public places, the Supreme Court of India has made it clear that 'no case can be made out' of two people consensually hugging and/or kissing. Supreme Court gave this verdict in response to a petition filed by actor Richard Gere to quash the arrest warrant issued by a Jaipur court. The arrest warrant was issued after the actor had taken Shilpa Shetty in his embrace and kissed her on the cheek at an AIDS awareness programme.
