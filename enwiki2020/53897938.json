A book for all ages, this will be especially welcomed by contemporary genderqueer youth and twentysomethings, who will see themselves in these vividly realized pages.\" and Quill & Quire calling it \"a rich and powerful exploration of gender, sexuality, religion, race, and the desire to fit in.\" The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books highlighted the synergy of Shraya and Neufeld; \"There is clear collaborative effort between the author and the illustrator, Neufeld, and the drawings are indeed one of the strongest elements, sharpening what are occasionally long passages into one searing image that captures the same tone.\" and concluded \"This may resonate most with older teens who may have also seen enough glimpses of life beyond high school to fully appreciate the evolution of the trapped, bullied kid represented to the sharp, poetic man who remembers being him.\" God Loves Hair has also been reviewed by Publishers Weekly, the School Library Journal, Kirkus Reviews, The Gazette, and CM: Canadian Review of Materials. ==References== Category:2014 short story collections Category:Canada in fiction Category:Canadian short story collections Category:Gay male literature Category:Young adult short story collections Category:LGBT literature in Canada Category:LGBT short story collections Category:2010s LGBT literature Category:Books by Vivek Shraya ",
