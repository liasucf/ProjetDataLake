    "text": "The DeLorean Motor Company (DMC) is a company established in 1995 and based in Humble, Texas. In 1995, Liverpool-born mechanic Stephen Wynne started a separate company using the \"DeLorean Motor Company\" name and shortly thereafter acquired the remaining parts inventory and the stylized \"DMC\" logo trademark of DeLorean Motor Company.DeLorean Motor Company Home. This current DeLorean Motor Company, located in Humble near Houston, Texas, is not, and has never been, associated with the original company, but supports owners of DeLoreans through service, restoration and the sale of NOS (New old stock), OEM (Original equipment manufacturer), aftermarket and replacement parts. DMC Texas, as they are known, has an additional two authorized dealers in Orlando, Florida; Crystal Lake, Illinois; and a company-owned location in Huntington Beach, California. ==History== The original DeLorean car was known for being in the Back to the Future media franchise. In August 2007, it emerged that due to demand for the DeLorean, DMC would start selling refurbished cars. Businessman Stephen Wynne purchased all the remaining parts for the car and builds them in Houston. At that time, a DeLorean could be assembled from the ground up using a combination of new, original and reproduction parts and a donor car (in order to still carry a 1980s title) for US$57,500. As of 2019, restored DeLorean cars can range in value from US$50,000 and upwards depending on the level of restoration completed and optional upgrades. Though DMC does not sell unrestored vehicles, they can run from about US$35,000 upwards on the used car market depending on condition. On December 3, 2009, DMC released a collection of T-shirts and hats in collaboration with streetwear brand The Hundreds, featuring modernized images of the DeLorean in Los Angeles culture- based graphic designs. The collaboration project also includes a special edition DeLorean painted in The Hundreds recognizable JAGS pattern in black and flat black which was for sale beginning 3 December 2009 and displayed at The Hundreds flagship store in Los Angeles the entire day. In November 2010, in collaboration with DMC, Nike released a limited edition DeLorean Dunk shoe with an estimated production of 1,000 pairs at a suggested retail price of $90. In October 2011, DMC announced intentions to sell custom-made electric DeLoreans by 2013, development on which has been stopped pending the outcome of the release of regulations pertaining to the Low Volume Vehicle Manufacturing Act. In 2014, Sally Baldwin, the widow of John DeLorean, sued the unaffiliated Texas-based DMC for misuse of trademarks and images which were never purchased after the bankruptcy of the original company, claiming that they were still owned by his estate. On October 20, 2015, the lawsuit was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum in exchange for DMC having the rights to use the DeLorean Motor Company name, trademarks and logo. In October 2017, DMC launched DMC Watches, in collaboration with a UK-based licensee which released two collections featuring design features from the DeLorean. In April 2018, Sally Baldwin, the widow of John DeLorean, again sued DMC for rights to the royalties from Universal Studios from the Back to the Future films. In October 2018, U.S. District Court Judge Jose Linares concluded that materials licensed to Universal were included in the earlier 2015 settlement. In the court ruling, the judge pointed out that in the 2015 settlement the DeLorean Estate pledged not to sue the automaker for using \"DeLorean\" and the \"DMC logo,\" and that Universal was given the right to use the appearance of the DeLorean car, and the right to use the \"DeLorean\" name and the \"DMC\" logo as it appears on the front of the time machine. Furthermore, the 2015 settlement agreement and Universal Studios agreement both pertain to the use of the above-mentioned names and trademarks in similar context, in this instance, the manufacturing and merchandising of products displaying the DeLorean car's image and brand. Shortly thereafter, Sally Baldwin appealed this decision. In an opinion dated December 5, 2019, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court decision in favor of DMC Texas. ==Proposed new production== Due to the passage of the Low Volume Vehicle Manufacturing Act, the production of the DeLorean was due to be relaunched in 2017, with 300 new cars produced by DMC. DMC originally anticipated building approximately 50 vehicles per year over the next 6 years with an estimated retail price of US$100,000. Both the EPA and NHTSA had one year to establish a process for companies to register with each agency and to issue any necessary regulation to implement the Low Volume Vehicle Manufacturing Act. However, the regulations were not published until December 2019https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/replica_vehicle_program_nprm_12172019.pdf. DMC Texas is now projecting they will begin production in Autumn 2021.https://www.autoblog.com/2020/01/24/delorean-motor-company-dmc-12-new- cars/ ==See also== * List of car manufacturers of the United States ==References== ==External links== * DeLorean Motor Company * Google Places facility tour Category:Motor vehicle manufacturers of the United States Category:Manufacturing companies based in Texas Category:Re-established companies Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1995 Category:1995 establishments in Texas Category:Companies based in Harris County, Texas ",
