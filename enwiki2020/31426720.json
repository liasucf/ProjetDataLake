    "text": "In the United States, hill climbs have a long tradition stretching back to the early days of motoring competition. Some are in the European-style and take place on long mountain courses, and in many cases spectators are either banned or heavily restricted for safety or insurance reasons. == Pikes Peak == The Pikes Peak International Hill Climb, held in Colorado Springs, Colorado is the world's premier Hill Climb Race. This event has been entered by many internationally renowned drivers, Indy 500 champions, and multiple world rally champions. The course finishes at a height of after navigating 156 turns. The current record holder is S\u00e9bastien Loeb, who reached Pikes Peak's Summit in 2013 in the purpose built Peugeot 208 T16 Pikes Peak with a time of 8:13.878. Additional races are held in Colorado, conducted by the Colorado Hill Climb Association (CHCA) during the summer months. These range in length from about two miles (3 km) to five miles (8 km) long. == Northwest Hillclimb Association == The Northwest Hillclimb Association (NHA) is based in the Pacific Northwest, and has been putting on a hillclimb series for several decades. NHA is currently run as a sanctioning body, and hillclimbs are hosted by various clubs in the region. The hillclimb series changes from year to year as new hills are added, and others may be cancelled due to inclement weather or road condition changes. Vehicle classing consists primarily of SCCA Solo classing, but allows for SCCA GCR classes, SOVREN Vintage classes, and several NHA Special classes. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+As of 2018, the NHA Hillclimb Series includes: !Name !Location !Hosting Club !Length (miles) !Elevation Change (feet) |- |Cascade Lakes Hillclimb |Ashland, OR |Siskiyou Sports Car Club |2.0 |407 |- |Freeze Out Hillclimb |Emmett, ID |Bogus Basin Hillclimb Association |1.6 |400 |- |Larison Rock Hillclimb |Oakridge, OR | Emerald Empire Sports Car Club |1.9 |823 |- |Maryhill Hillclimb |Goldendale, WA | Willamette Motor Club |2.0 |531 |- |Hoopa Hillclimb |Hoopa, CA |Redwood Sports Car Club |2.1 |1,152 |- |Bible Creek Hillclimb |Willamina, OR |Willamette Motor Club |2.2 |653 |} == Eagle Rock == The Eagle Rock Hill Climb is the oldest recorded official hill climb ever run in the United States.

The mile-long course has a 110-degree turn and up to 20% grade as racers overlook the city. Giants Despair Hillclimb is held just outside Wilkes-Barre, PA, in Laurel Run Borough on East Northampton St. This community has been host to this event since it was first held in 1906. It is one of the oldest continuing motor racing events in the world. The Giant is rich in tradition. In its early years, all of the world\u2019s major manufacturers sent their top cars and drivers to capture honors at the event. Early notables included Ralph DePalma (Fiat Team) and Louis Chevrolet driving for Buick. Rejuvenated in 1951, the list of Who\u2019s Who in the driving world included Carroll Shelby,Dallas Morning News, July 21, 1956, Part 1, Page 11; National Newsletter, S.C.C.A., No.25, August 10, 1956. first driver to break the magic minute, Roger Penske and Oscar Koveleski. In 2002 Ron Moreck broke the 40-second mark. The hill starts out with a long gently rising straight about one quarter mile in length that leads into a fast left-hander that tests both nerves and skill. Then on to a short chute and \"Devils Elbow,\" a sharply rising hairpin that goes off camber at its crest. Next is a series of ninety- degree turns connected by short straights. Then comes \"The Incline,\" a meandering quarter mile stretch that rises at twenty- two degrees to the finish. * Location: Wilkes-Barre, PA * Length: 1 mile * Elevation Change: Approx. 650' * Number of Turns: 6 * Record: Darryl Danko - 38.360 (2007) ===Duryea/Pagoda Hillclimbs=== The scenic route on the hill overlooking Reading, Pennsylvania hosts two events on the same stretch of road, the Pagoda and Duryea Hillclimbs. Pagoda is a shortened version of Duryea, starting at turn 1 and finishing at turn 9. ====Duryea Hillclimb==== The Blue Mountain Region SCCA hosts the longest hill in the PHA series. Named for the obscure automobile maker and following the same route that Charles Duryea used to test his cars, this is a hill located in a beautiful city park in downtown Reading. With a history dating back to 1951, festivities this year will include a celebration of the 100th anniversary of the automobile. Possibly the most diverse and challenging hill in the Northeast, Duryea boasts 11 turns (most of which are negotiated in the first half of the course) coupled with some high (140 mph+) speeds at the top. Duryea's finish line elevation is 1100 ft. * Location: Reading, PA * Length: 2.3 miles * Elevation Change: 800' * Number of Turns: 13 * Record: George Bowland - 105.528 (2008) ====Pagoda Hillclimb==== This is run on the same mountain as Duryea Hillclimb. Named after the Pagoda which decorates turn 10, this is a handling course which offers all the challenges of turns 1-9 (including the famous turn 6), while leaving out the high power final straight of Duryea. The start and finish line was moved in 2011 to accommodate and larger pit area like the drivers enjoy at the Duryea event. All previous records of the old course have been archived and all new records are being recorded. The start is now at Duryea Start line, finish line is between turns 9 and 10, so there are now nine turns. Elevation above sea level at star tline is 460', elevation at finish line is about 870' for a rise of 410'. * Length: 1.35 miles * Elevation Change: 410' * Number of Turns: 9 * Record: George Bowland - 73.374 (2011) ===Rose Valley Hillclimb=== Located just north of Williamsport, PA, off Route 15 in the town of Trout Run, PA. This event is usually held in late July or early August. It began life in 1967 and has been a favorite of many drivers. This is a hill with a dual personality. Leaving the start line you get up to speed very quickly as there is only a slight elevation change on the bottom portion of the hill. You encounter several turns that are fast and leave one to decide whether to brake or to brake and downshift are required for a fast run through this lower section. Suddenly, as you exit the last of these turns, you are met by the second phase of this hill - Big Bend - a steeply rising hairpin turn. From here on its uphill through series of kinks and bends that require your utmost attention before reaching the finish line. * Location: Trout Run, PA * Length: 1.2 miles * Elevation Change: Approx. 580' * Number of Turns: 7 * Record: Darryl Danko - 51.770 (2006) ===Weatherly Hillclimb=== The season starts and ends with the Weatherly Hillclimbs. These two events are held on the outskirts of Weatherly, PA, a quiet little town that has been hosting these events since 1960. If engineers designed a public road to be a thrill ride, this is it. The hill consists of uphill straights leading into hairpin turns, one called \"the Wall\" that has to be seen and driven to be believed, followed by a hairpin turn, a short run to another hard right hand turn and then the \"Jump\" where most cars leave contact with the pavement. From this point the rest of the hill consists of a short straight leading to a long sweeping turn to the finish that tests your tires grip on the road as well as your nerve. This hill is a rush from start to finish. * Location: Weatherly, PA * Length: 1 mile * Elevation Change: Approx. 340' * Number of Turns: 6 * Record: George Bowland - 47.592 (Spring 2012) ===Polish Mountain Hillclimb=== Although situated approximately one mile south of the Mason\u2013Dixon line near Gilpin, MD, this is a PHA championship event. * Length: 1.2 mile * Elevation Change: Approx. 500' * Number of Turns: 9 * Record: George Bowland - 50.708 (2008) ==Vermont== The New England Sports Car Club Council (NESCCC) is formed by three smaller clubs; the Killington Sports Car Club (KSCC), the Sports Car Club of New Hampshire (SCCNH), and the Sports Car Club of Vermont (SCCV).http://www.SCCV.org The groups sponsor a series of hill climbing events on paved mountain access roads in Vermont using common rules under the New England Hillclimb Association (NEHA). These events are staggered start, timed trials and club members as well as novices are welcome to participate provided their car passes a technical inspection and the driver meets the guidelines. In addition to numerous other safety measures, the driver must be over 18 years old, drive with a Snell\u00ae approved helmet, and have a 2.5 lb ABC fire extinguisher in his vehicle. The club's liability insurance for the race events covers a driver's damage to another car or any emergency medical treatment a driver may require. Other safety measures are outlined in the club's rules and regulations. The council meets yearly to review, update, and change these rules and regulations. One rule is that a car need not have a roll cage and other additional safety measures unless they exceed a course's breakout time. If a racer exceeds the breakout time more than once, they are required to have a roll cage in their car, and must wear a fire suit and neck protection device. The races take place during the summer months on weekends. Spectators are prohibited and the club controls this by renting the hills for their own use during race weekends. Only at Okemo are spectators permitted to watch from the starting line. Non-racers can participate in events by volunteering as workers and these workers can be 16 years old or older. The race hills, length of course, and breakout times for each course are as follows: *Ascutney in Windsor - 2.9 miles, breakout time 3:20 *Bolton - 1.8 miles, breakout time 1:32 (has not been run since 2004) *Burke in Lyndonville - 2.1 miles, breakout time 2:30 *Okemo in Ludlow - 2.7 miles, breakout time 2:43 *Philo in Charlotte - 1.1 miles, breakout time 1:20 ==Rib Mountain, Wisconsin== On June 15\u201316, 1957, the Milwaukee region of the S.C.C.A. held their first national event at Rib Mountain near Wausau, Wisconsin. John Kilborn (driving a Ferrari Monza) set the fastest time of the day in 1.299 minutes. The organizers used a novel system of timing, measuring in minutes to three decimal places.Sports Car, S.C.C.A. magazine, Sept-Oct 1957, Pages 68-69. This was the only time such an event was held at Rib Mountain. ==Ten Sleep, Wyoming== First Place in the 1961 contest went to Chuck Frederick of Golden, Colo., driving a Corvette up the winding course at better than a mile a minute; time, 4:39. First Place in the 1962 contest went to Gene Mitchell of Billings, Mont., driving a Corvette over the dangerous five-mile course in 4:51.7 averaging 61.7 mph. The 1961 and 1962 information is from the 1963 Ten Sleep Canyon Sports Car Hill Climb program, inside front cover. Chuck Frederick set the Track record of 4:35.6 in 1964 Driving a Lotus 19 with a 289 V8. On August 15, 1965, Phillip Lyman, of Ten Sleep, Wyoming, won the fifth annual TenSleep Canyon hillclimb, driving a Chevrolet Corvette Sting Ray, in a time of 4:48.1 sec.Competition Press & Autoweek, September 11, 1965, Page W-A. ==See also== * Sports Car Club of America * Mount Washington Hillclimb Auto Race * Hillclimbing in the British Isles == References == == External links == * Hillclimbs of the USA and Canada: Category:Hillclimbing ",
