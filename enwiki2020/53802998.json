    "text": "The gens Pedia was a plebeian family at Rome. Members of this gens are first mentioned in history during the final century of the Republic, and for the next two centuries they were distinguished in statesmanship, rhetoric, art, and law. The first of the Pedii to obtain the consulship was Quintus Pedius, the nephew of Caesar, in 43 BC.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 164 (Pedius, No. 1). ==Origin== Little is known of the Pedii and their origin. The nomen Pedius might be derived from the cognomen Pedo, a name referring to someone with broad feet.Chase, p. 110. ==Praenomina== The main families of the Pedii used the praenomina Quintus and Sextus, both of which were very common throughout Roman history. Individual families used other names, such as Lucius, Gaius, Marcus, Publius, Titus, Gnaeus, and Numerius. ==Branches and cognomina== The Pedii of the Republic do not seem to have had any hereditary surnames, but one member of the family bore the cognomen Poplicola or Publicola, famous from an early family of the Valerii; the surname means \"one who courts the people.\"Horace, Satirae, i. 10. 28.Chase, p. 107. Although this cognomen appears in other families, the Pedii were connected with the Valerii Messallae, a later family of the Valeria gens which revived the more ancient surname, and it seems clear that it was through this relationship that the name appears among the Pedii.Pliny the Elder, xxxv. 4. s. 7. Not long after the time of this family, another branch appears bearing the surname Hirrutus, of uncertain origin. The first of this family rose to prominence early in the reign of Tiberius, and although the name does not appear again until the second century, one of the Pedii Hirruti obtained the consulship in AD 158.. The jurist Sextus Pedius may have belonged to this family, although proof is wanting; other prominent Pedii during this period may also have belonged to this branch.PIR, vol. III, p. 20. ==Members== * Quintus (or Marcus) Pedius, father of the consul, was probably the husband of Julia and brother-in-law of Caesar. * Quintus Pedius, the nephew of Caesar, served as legates under his uncle during the Gallic War and the Civil War, and in 45 BC received a triumph for his victories. He was consul suffectus in 43, together with his cousin, Octavian, the future emperor, and addressed the people in order to avert a rebellion over the proscriptions of the triumvirs, but died from stress and fatigue the following night.Cicero, Pro Plancio, 7, 22 (and see Wunder, Prolegomena, p. lxxxiii ff. in his edition), Epistulae ad Atticum, ix. 14.Caesar, De Bello Gallico, ii. 1, De Bello Civili, iii. 22, De Bello Hispaniensis, 2.Suetonius, \"The Life of Caesar\", 83, \"The Life of Nero\", 3, \"The Life of Galba\", 3.Fasti Triumphales.Cassius Dio, xliii. 31, 32, xlvi. 46, 52.Appian, Bellum Civile, iii. 22, 94, 96, iv. 6.Velleius Paterculus, ii. 69.Glandorp, Onomasticon Historiae Romanae, p. 432. * Quintus Pedius Q. f. Poplicola, quaestor urbanus in 41 BC, is described by Horace as a famous orator. He is generally supposed to have been the son of the consul Quintus Pedius, and father of the painter.. * Quintus Pedius Q. f. Q. n., the grandson of Caesar's nephew, was mute from birth, but under the supervision of his uncle, Messalla, and with the approval of Augustus, he was tutored in painting, at which he became greatly skilled. Pedius died before reaching adulthood. * Lucius Pedius Blaesus, proconsul of Crete and Cyrenaica during the reign of Nero, was expelled from the senate in AD 59 for having plundered the temple of Aesculapius at Cyrene, and for other acts of corruption. He was restored to the senate by Otho in 69.Tacitus, Annales, xiv. 18, Historiae, i. 77.. * Gnaeus Pedius Cascus, consul suffectus ex Kal. Apr. in AD 71, with the future emperor Domitian.Gallivan, \"The Fasti for A.D. 70\u201396\", p. 187. * Sextus Pedius, a prominent jurist who lived during later first and early second centuries. His original works have been lost, but he is cited in the Digest by Julius Paulus and Ulpian, among others, and best known for his common-sense approach to legal interpretation.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, pp. 164, 165 (\"Sextus Pedius\"). * Sextus Pedius Sex. f. Palpinianus, a procurator Augusti, and the father of Sextus Pedius Justus..PIR, vol. III, p. 21. * Sextus Pedius Sex. f. Sex. n.
