He came through the youth team at Port Vale, and has played for Mansfield Town, Stafford Rangers, Leek Town, Solihull Moors, Kidsgrove Athletic and Nantwich Town. ==Club career== Bell came through the youth ranks at Port Vale and turned professional with the League Two club under Micky Adams in April 2010. However, he failed to make a first team appearance at Vale Park and was released in May 2011. He signed a one-year contract with Conference National club Mansfield Town in June 2011. Manager Paul Cox stated that \"He has a lovely left foot, is tenacious, has high fitness levels and can play at left-back, left-midfield and even in central midfield\". He was loaned out to Northern Premier League side Stafford Rangers in December 2011 and Leek Town in March 2012. He signed with Kidsgrove Athletic in February 2015. He joined Nantwich Town in May 2015. He helped the \"Dabbers\" to reach the semi-finals of the FA Trophy in 2015\u201316, scoring 12 goals in all competitions, and then to qualify for the Northern Premier League play-offs the following season, scoring eight goals from 51 appearances. This season also saw him collect the Players Player of the Year award for his performances. He lifted the Cheshire Senior Cup after scoring in a 3\u20130 win over Stockport Town in the 2018 final. He also played and scored in the 2019 final, a 5\u20132 victory over Cammell Laird 1907. He also helped the \"Dabbers\" to reach the 2018\u201319 play-offs, where they were beaten by Warrington Town in the semi-finals. Bell re-joined Leek Town in October 2019, ending his Nantwich Town record with 31 goals from 199 competitive appearances. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in England, the 2019\u201320 Northern Premier League Division One South East season was formally abandoned on 26 March 2020, with all results from the season being expunged. ==International career== Bell was called up to the British Virgin Islands squad and made his debut on 26 March 2015, in a 3\u20132 defeat to Dominica at Windsor Park in the First Round of qualifying for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. He played in the reverse fixture three days later, a 0\u20130 draw which eliminated the British Virgin Islands from the competition. ==Statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !rowspan=\"2\"|Division !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goal |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Port Vale |2009\u201310||League Two||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2010\u201311||League Two||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0 |- |Mansfield Town |2011\u201312||Conference National||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- |Solihull Moors |2011\u201312||Conference North||4||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||4||0 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Nantwich Town |2017\u201318 |Northern Premier League Premier Division||37||8||||||||||10||2||47||10 |- |2018\u201319 |Northern Premier League Premier Division||32||1||||||||||5||1||37||2 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Leek Town |2019\u201320 |Northern Premier League Division One South East||16||2||0||0||2||0||2||0||20||2 |- |2020\u201321 |Northern Premier League Division One South East||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !16!!2!!0!!0!!2!!0!!2!!0!!20!!2 |} ==Honours== Nantwich Town *Cheshire Senior Cup: 2018, 2019 ==References== Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Stoke-on-Trent Category:British Virgin Islands footballers Category:British Virgin Islands international footballers Category:Association football fullbacks Category:Association football midfielders Category:Association football utility players Category:Port Vale F.C. players Category:Mansfield Town F.C. players Category:Leek Town F.C. players Category:Stafford Rangers F.C. players Category:Solihull Moors F.C. players Category:Kidsgrove Athletic F.C. players Category:Nantwich Town F.C. players Category:National League (English football) players Category:Northern Premier League players ",
