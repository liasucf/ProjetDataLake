    "text": "Ringwood North is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 24 km east of Melbourne's Central Business District. It is located mainly within the City of Maroondah local government area, with a small part in the north west of the suburb being located in the City of Manningham. At the 2016 Census, Ringwood North had a population of 9,832. It is bounded on the south by Loughnan, Warrandyte and Wonga Roads (these roads flow into one another continuously). Glenvale Road forms the westernmost boundary in the southern part of the suburb, with the Warrandyte-Ringwood Road forming the western boundary at the northern end of the suburb. The eastern and northern boundaries follow property lines, rather than roads. Ringwood North Post Office opened on 9 August 1920, in the then rural area. Ringwood North has its own shopping centre and also has plenty of parklands and reserves nearby without being excessively rural, like Wonga Park or Warrandyte. Its roads feature a happy medium between the sterile, parallel streetscapes of Ringwood and the circular, 'contour-line' style streets found in neighbouring Park Orchards. Ringwood North is a surprisingly hilly area, which is especially evident around the aptly named Loughnan's Hill area and the infamously steep Glenvale Road. Glenvale Road also happens to mark the boundary between Ringwood North and Donvale and also the boundary between Maroondah and Manningham. It was the scene of a major car accident several years ago, in which a Holden HQ one- tonne utility carrying a large load of bricks overturned upon making its descent. Glenvale Road is also home to an 80-year-old Tudor house of famous heritage. ==Education== Government primary schools in Ringwood North are: * Mullum Primary SchoolMullum Primary School * Ringwood Heights Primary SchoolRingwood Heights Primary School * Ringwood North Primary SchoolRingwood North Primary School Catholic schools in Ringwood North: * Holy Spirit Community SchoolHoly Spirit Community School ==Sport== The suburb has an Australian rules football team, the North Ringwood Saints, who compete in the Eastern Football League.
