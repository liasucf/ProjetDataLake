    "text": "The Commissioner of Corrective Services is a statutory office-holder in the State of New South Wales, Australia, with responsibility for the State's prison, parole and community corrections systems. The incumbent is Peter Severin. Prior to 2009, the Commissioner managed his own Department of Corrective Services. Since 2009, Corrections has been a division of the State's justice department, currently known as the Department of Communities and Justice. == Previous office-holders == Between 1979 and 1988, the Department of Corrective Services was managed by a five-person Corrective Services Commission. This model had been recommended by John Nagle in his royal commission report. From 2009, the Commissioner served as a deputy secretary within the larger Department of Justice. Although commissioners have generally been recruited from other professions, both the incumbent and his predecessor began their careers as prison officers. === List of Corrective Services Commissioners === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ !Name ! class=\"unsortable\" | Title ! class=\"unsortable\" | Agency !Term start ! class=\"unsortable\" | Term end !Term duration |- | data-sort-value=\"Brewer\" |Henry Brewer |Provost Marshal | | | | |- |Thomas Smyth |Provost Marshal | | | | |- |Garnham Blaxcell |Acting Provost Marshal | | | | |- |William Gore |Provost Marshal | | | | |- |John Thomas Campbell |Provost Marshal | | | | |- |John Mackaness |Sheriff |Office of the Sheriff | | | |- |William Carter |Sheriff |Office of the Sheriff |1828 |1828 | |- |Thomas Macquoid |Sheriff |Office of the Sheriff |1829 |1841 | |- |Adolphus William Young |Sheriff |Office of the Sheriff |1843 |1849 | |- |Gilbert Eliot |Sheriff |Office of the Sheriff |1849 |1854 | |- |John O'Neill Brenan |Sheriff |Office of the Sheriff |1855 |1860 | |- |George Richard Uhr |Sheriff |Office of the Sheriff |1861 |1864 | |- |Harold Maclean |Sheriff |Office of the Sheriff |1864 |1874 | |- | data-sort-value=\"Maclean\" |Harold Maclean |Comptroller-General |Department of Prisons |1874 |1889 | |- |George Miller |Comptroller-General |Department of Prisons | |1896 | |- |William Neitenstein |Comptroller-General |Department of Prisons | | | |- |WM McFarlane |Comptroller-General |Department of Prisons | | | |- |Samuel McCauley |Comptroller-General |Department of Prisons | | | |- |Denis Gaynor D'Arcy |Comptroller-General |Department of Prisons | | | |- |William Urquhart |Comptroller-General |Department of Prisons | | | |- |HH McDougall |Comptroller-General |Department of Prisons | | | |- |George Steele |Comptroller-General |Department of Prisons | | | |- |William Francis Hinchy |Comptroller-General |Department of Prisons | | | |- |George F.
