    "text": "Ranch to Market Road 2244 (RM 2244) is an state-maintained roadway located in Travis County, Texas. It is simply called 2244 for short as well as Bee Cave Road or Bee Caves Road. Whether the name of the road is Bee Cave (singular) or Bee Caves (plural) is a matter of some confusion even among locals (road signs vary), but the prevailing view is that Bee Caves Road leads to the town of Bee Cave, Texas, and at least one local newspaper has settled on the plural name for the road.http://impactnews.com/articles/bee-cave%28s%29-road%3F/ (This confusion is not recent: The post office for the town of Bee Cave opened there under the name Bee Caves in 1870.) http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hnb17 == History == RM 2244 was designated on September 29, 1954 RM 93(now SH 71) southeast to west Austin city limits. On July 16, 1957, RM 2244 was extended southeast to US 290 (now Loop 343). On September 6, 1975, the section from Loop 1 to Loop 343 was removed from the state highway system (now Barton Springs Road). Another section was transferred to Loop 1. On June 27, 1995, the designation of RM 2244 was changed to Urban Road 2244 (UR 2244), although as with most Urban Roads, no signage changes have been made. == Route description == RM 2244 starts at an intersection with SH 71 in the south part of Bee Cave, Texas. It proceeds east for as a four-lane divided roadway to intersect Loop 360. After leaving Bee Cave, the road is relatively lightly developed, although it passes by the community of Lost Creek.
