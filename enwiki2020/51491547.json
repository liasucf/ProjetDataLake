He shares a special secret with her: Leo possesses the ability to separate his spirit from his physical body, allowing him to hover and fly through the air in an intangible, invisible, and impalpable form, with his body remaining mostly asleep. He refers to this state as a \"Phantom\". Leo cannot spend too much time away from his body, as he will begin to fade away before disappearing entirely. Meanwhile, NYPD Lieutenant Alex Tanner is demoted by his boss, Captain Simon, and assigned grunt work after he manages to catch two burglars robbing a supermarket, but blows up part of the building in the process. Leo is taken to the hospital for more tests, as his unspecified chronic illness worsens. He laments over the loss of his hair and follows his mother home as a phantom. She weeps over Leo's health but does not let Lily see her cry. That night, a strange man with a broken face makes a phone call to the Mayor. He proceeds to cause a mass blackout over New York City and informs the Mayor that he is in possession of a computer virus with the power to destroy the entire city's infrastructure. He demands a payment of one billion dollars in the next 24 hours or the virus will be unleashed. While the man refers to himself as the King of New York, newspaper outlets begin calling him \"The Face\". Tanner attempts to apprehend The Face at the docks but is outsmarted and left for dead under a broken crate. Tanner is transferred to a hospital, where his phantom encounters Leo's. Leo guides Tanner's phantom back to his body, as Leo has done for countless other patients. When Tanner awakens, Leo is shocked to find that Tanner remembers his phantom, as all other patients forget. Tanner meets with Miss Mary Delaney, a reporter with an anonymous lead as to the location of The Face. Leo convinces Tanner to let his phantom tag along since Tanner's leg is still broken. Mary is ambushed by The Face but manages to escape with the help of Leo's phantom and Tanner (via telephone). Tanner blackmails a favor from The Mole, an ex-con on parole. The Mole and Mary look for information pertaining to The Face's whereabouts as Leo's phantom follows. When his phantom returns to the hospital, Leo sees his parents crying and Lily reading to an imaginary version of Leo so she does not get lonely. The Face captures Mary after The Mole fails to rescue her and is knocked unconscious. The Big Guy and The Little Guy, The Face's henchmen, arrive at the hospital with orders to kill Tanner. Tanner manages to gain the upper hand but The Big Guy runs off with Leo's body. Leo's phantom is able to return just as hospital security arrests the two hitmen. Leo's phantom follows The Face's dog back to the docks. It leads Leo to a ship called Vizir where Mary is held captive. Nearing midnight, The Face leaves Mary on the ship and detonates a bomb. She frantically attempts to shut down the virus by guessing the password, eventually succeeding with \"Eyelids\". Tanner, and Leo's fading phantom, help her escape but The Face returns, furious that his plan is ruined. During the confrontation, The Face lashes out at his dog, resulting in the dog attacking him. Mary makes it off the ship as it sinks. Leo's phantom races back to the hospital but disappears before he can rejoin his body. Spiritless, Leo's body falls into a coma. Tanner, guilty about Leo endangering his life to save Mary, tells her about Leo's abilities. Lily reads one of her bedtime stories to Leo's body, and his spirit is able to return. He tearfully reunites with his family. Some time later, Tanner's leg has healed and he begins a relationship with Mary. He receives a call from Captain Simon informing him that the Mayor wants to congratulate him with a ceremony and a promotion, much to the Captain's dismay. Back at home, Leo reads Lily a story and gazes out at the New York City skyline. ==Voice cast== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Character ! French voice actor ! English dubbing actor |- | Lt.
