The chips are sold at many local businesses, from mom and pop stores to chains such as Schnucks and even 7-Eleven. == Flavor == Red Hot Riplets are spicier than potato chips available in national brands. The chips have a bright red color that comes naturally from the powdered peppers. Red Hot Riplets used to be fried in partially hydrogenated vegetable shortening, but they are now fried in liquid vegetable oils. Old Vienna has also made Red Hot Thins with same seasoning on thin-cut potato chips, Cheesy Red Hot Riplets with the addition of a cheese powder, and Red Hot Pork rinds. In 2003 Esquire magazine included Red Hot Riplets in their article and list \"Best Potato Chips You've Never Tasted\". == Manufacturer == Old Vienna Snack Food Company was founded in 1936 by Louis Kaufman in St. Louis. The firm changed hands many times before folding in 1996. In that same year, a group of former employees resurrected the brand, which continues to be headquartered in the city of Fenton, a suburb of St. Louis. , the company had about 20 employees. As of late 2007, there was a bottled hot sauce with a label similar to the Red Hot Riplets bag, that contained \"St. Louis Style\" hot sauce. The hot sauce has since been discontinued.
