    "text": "Breaza () is a town in Prahova County, Muntenia, Romania. ==Name== The town's name is derived from a Slavic word, breza, meaning \"birch tree\". ==History== The town was first documented in an act of 1503, mentioning a certain trader of Breaza called \"Neagoe\". In 1622 the land of Breaza was divided between four boyars and in 1717, the new ruler of Wallachia, Nicolae Mavrocordat gave the Breaza estate to boyar Iordache Cre\u0163ulescu. The land was divided by the agrarian reform of 1921 and in 1935 it was declared a spa. ==Geography== The town center consists of at least two former villages, Podu Vadului and Breaza de Sus, which were later merged. Today, ten villages are administratively part of the town: Breaza de Jos, Breaza de Sus, Fr\u0103sinet, Gura Beliei, Irime\u0219ti, Nistore\u0219ti, Podu Corbului, Podu Vadului, Surde\u0219ti and Valea T\u00e2rsei. One of the main occupations is farming, and traditional needlework, but many inhabitants also commute to work in the neighboring towns of Comarnic and C\u00e2mpina. Tourism is also important for the local economy, and many locals rent out rooms in the summer months. Due to its naturally beautiful surroundings, being located among rolling hills, the town has long been popular with inhabitants of Bucharest, who tend to have vacation homes here. Among the people who are rumored to have second residences in Breaza are Adrian P\u0103unescu and Valentin Ceau\u0219escu. It is also the site of a folk art museum and a military high school. ==References== Category:Towns in Romania Category:Populated places in Prahova County Category:Localities in Muntenia Category:Place names of Slavic origin in Romania ",
