Co-produced by Tobias Gustafsson, Vincent Pontare, and Michel Zitron, \"Teardrops\" was released alongside \"Amaze Me\" on 19 October 2007 (see 2007 in music).

The quartet premiered the single on the television live show ZDF Fernsehgarten on 9 September 2007. ===Music video=== The music video for \"Teardrops\" was directed by Marcus Sternberg and shot in a filming studio between 20\u201322 August 2007 in Berlin, Germany. Shot over twenty hours back-to- back with the video for \"Amaze Me\", the edited clip premiered on 29 September 2007 on the Universal Music Group website. The clip received its first official airing in the week of 29 September 2007, on German music network iMusic1. The group has declared the filming of the \"mammoth shoot\" as \"extremely exhausting\", referring to its extraordinary length and a delay of several hours, caused by various technical defects. Lucy Diakovska has described the plotless clip as a \"funky disco-dance-energy-video\", reflecting another facet of the band in music and style. Inspired by a concept developed by all four members and based on Sternberg's treatment, the music video was eventually conceived as a stylistic counterpart to \"Amaze Me\". ===Formats and track listings=== * CD single (\"Teardrops\" edition) # \"Amaze Me\" (Album Version) \u2013 3:48 # \"Teardrops\" (Single Version) \u2013 3:13 # \"Teardrops\" (Mozart&Friends; Club Mix) \u2013 3:45 # \"Teardrops\" (Mozart&Friends; Psychedelic Mix) \u2013 3:44 # \"Teardrops\" (Mozart&Friends; House Mix) \u2013 5:26 # \"Teardrops\" (Video) * CD single (\"Amaze Me\" edition) # \"Amaze Me\" (Album Version) \u2013 3:47 # \"Teardrops\" (Single Version) \u2013 3:13 # \"Ain't Gonna Look the Other Way\" \u2013 3:50 # \"Amaze Me\" (Remix) \u2013 3:47 # \"Amaze Me\" (Instrumental) \u2013 3:47 # \"Amaze Me\" (Video) ==Kate Alexa version== In early 2008, Australian singer Kate Alexa covered the song for her second studio album.

Alexa states \"He's a very cool guy. He came in and did the rap in one take, and it fitted perfectly. It\u2019s got such an incredible feel and groove and we wanted to keep that vibe.
