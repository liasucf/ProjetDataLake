    "text": "LDAP Admin is a free, open-source LDAP directory management tool licensed under the GNU General Public License. Small and compact, LDAP Admin is also highly configurable through the use of the template extensions. In addition to common browsing and editing functions, LDAP Admin provides a directory management functionality by supporting a number of application-specific LDAP objects such as Posix and Samba groups and accounts, Postfix objects and a number of Active Directory objects.
