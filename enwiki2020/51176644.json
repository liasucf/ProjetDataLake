It is in G\u00e4rdsl\u00f6sa socken. the village had 59 inhabitants. The name of the settlement appears as S\u00f6derby in older sources. One possible etymology is that it is \"south\" (), but there is no obvious centre to the north to which this might refer; another suggestion is that it derives from a word such as sur or s\u00f6rjig (damp, slushy) and meant a marshy area. In 1540 the village was part of the lands of the Diocese of Link\u00f6ping and had 3\u00bd dwellings and 6 smallholdings; in 1544 there were 4 freeholders, one of them Gustav Vasa. Painted pew in G\u00e4rdsl\u00f6sa Church: the village name is written Syderby on the left. ==References== Category:Populated places in Kalmar County ",
