    "text": "Skyscraper \u2013 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the film score to the 2018 film of the same name, written and composed by Steve Jablonsky. The score was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London with an orchestra conducted by Alastair King. Additional mixing was done at Arata Music Studios. The soundtrack was digitally released on July 13, 2018 by Milan Records with the physical soundtrack being released later on August 3, 2018. ==Background== Steve Jablonsky was hired to score the film, replacing Thurber's frequent composer, Theodore Shapiro. For the basis of the score, Jablonsky worked with traditional orchestra and blended looped guitar riffs which consisted of both acoustic and electric. He did this to make the film more realistic and gritty, avoiding the notion of a hero-esque theme. As for the character of Botha, Jablonsky discarded the use of an orchestra to represent the villain. So, he came up with a \"unique percussion rhythm\" by recording \"tom-toms through several distortion pedals and a compressor.\" which Thurber liked a lot. Luke Richards, Christian Wibe and Bryce Jacobs provided additional music. ==Track listing== Track 18, Walls by Jamie N Commons, is played during the end credits of the film. A further track from the end credits, Break in the Clouds by Frightened Rabbit, is not included in the soundtrack album. ==Personnel== * Original Score Composed & Produced- Steve Jablonsky * Music Supervisors \u2014 Peter Afterman & Magaret Yen * Associate Music Supervisor \u2014 Alison Litton * Music Coordinator \u2014 Oriana Pedone * Mixing Engineer \u2014 Jeff Biggers * Recording Engineer \u2014 Andrew Dudman * Orchestra Leader \u2014 Everton Nelson * Solo Cello \u2014 Tim Gill * Guitars \u2014 Tom Strahle, Steve Jablonsky & Bryce Jacobs * Drums \u2014 Jon Jablonsky * Technical Score Engineer \u2014 Lori Castro * Orchestra Conducted - Alastair King * Orchestrators \u2014 Larry Rench & Jeremy Borum * Librarian \u2014 Jill Streater * Assistant Engineers \u2014 Matt Jones & George Oulton ==References== ==External links== * * Skyscraper on Milan Records Category:2018 soundtrack albums Category:Milan Records soundtracks Category:Action film soundtracks ",
