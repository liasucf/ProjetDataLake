Parcent has a population of about 1100 and is about one hour's drive north of the city of Alicante, and about an hour's drive south of the city of Valencia. It features the small Holy Virgin church, and is surrounded by hills and mountains. Writer Gabriel Mir\u00f3 (1879-1930) was a resident of Parcent and called it a \"paradise between the mountains\". It is also close to Jal\u00f3n (written as Xal\u00f3 in Catalan), which is known for its wine production and markets. The traditional economy of Parcent relies on almond and orange farming in the surrounding area. ==History== The name \"Parcent\" is of Latin origin. Later, it was a Moorish town until the forces of James I of Aragon conquered it in 1256 CE. There was a major outbreak of leprosy in Parcent in 1850 and by 1887 20% of the residents of Parcent were afflicted.On the Origin and Spread of Leprosy in Parcent, Spain, George Thin, Lancet, p. 134, January 16th, 1892. This apparently motivated the inclusion of passages about the disease in Mir\u00f3's two so-called \"Oleza\" novels.The Biblical Allusions in Gabriel Miro's Oleza Novels, G. G. Brown, The Modern Language Review, Vol. 70, No. 4 (Oct., 1975), pp. 786-794 ==Demographics== The 2006 census established that Parcent's population was 1,019 inhabitants. It was also revealed that about 35.10% of the population of Parcent were not Spanish citizens but were in fact incomers from other countries within the European Union. ==Controversy== Many Europeans from other areas have built retirement or second homes in Parcent, mainly due to the sunshine and proximity to the beaches. However, Parcent and the surrounding valley are suffering growing pains as development quickens.In Spain, a Tide Of Development: Land Laws on the Mediterranean Coast Enable a Boom but Bring Corruption, John Ward Anderson, Washington Post Foreign Service, Wednesday, October 25, 2006 Protest marchers in Parcent concerned about growth plans ==References== Category:Municipalities in the Province of Alicante ",
