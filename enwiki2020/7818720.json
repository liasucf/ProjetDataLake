    "text": "This is a complete list of Philippine presidents by college education that consists of the 16 heads of state in the history of the Philippines. Almost all presidents (except Emilio Aguinaldo and Joseph Estrada) completed a college degree program. College and postgraduate education have prepared presidents in their future roles as heads of state, architects of foreign policy, commanders-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and managers of the entire government bureaucracy. By law, under the Constitution of the Philippines, any Filipino citizen aged forty and above who can read and write and can meet residency requirements is eligible to run as President. However, in practice, popularity, political machinery, and financial resources are the key elements leading to a successful presidential candidate. == List by degree == This section lists presidents according to schools from which they earned degrees. Schools that presidents attended but did not earn degrees from are not included. === Did not graduate from college === * Emilio Aguinaldo (A cholera epidemic forced the Colegio de San Juan de Letran where Aguinaldo attended the equivalent of high school to close in 1880. Aguinaldo never returned to any form of schooling following this closure.) * Joseph Estrada (Estrada attended Map\u00faa Institute of Technology before transferring to Polytechnic Colleges of the Philippines, where he later dropped out. (republished by Google Books)) === LL.B. === The J.D. was first conferred in the Philippines in lieu of the LL.B. by the Ateneo Law School in 1990, with the model program later adopted by most schools now offering the J.D.University of the Philippines College of Law. News . April 24, 2008.The Weekly Sillimanian Vol. LXXXII No.4: SU Law adopts Juris Doctor Program. By: Princess Dianne Kris S. Decierdo. Published July 15, 2009. Archived copies can be viewed and verified at the Sillimaniana Section of the Silliman University Main Library.
