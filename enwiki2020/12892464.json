    "text": "Lasianthus is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. They are tropical subshrubs, shrubs, or rarely, small trees. They inhabit the understory of primary forests. None of them are known to have any use. Lasianthus has about 180 species. The type species for the genus is Lasianthus cyanocarpus. Lasianthus In: Index Nominum Genericorum. In: Regnum Vegetabile (see External links below). In 2012, a revision of Lasianthus in Malesia described 131 species.Hua Zhu, Marco C. Roos, and Colin E.

Two species (Lasianthus panamensis and Lasianthus lanceolatus),Elmar Robbrecht. 1982. \"The identity of the Panamanian genus Dressleriopsis (Rubiaceae)\".

The Australian Ixora baileyana had at one time been placed in Lasianthus as Lasianthus graciliflorus.Laurie G. Adams, Diane M. Bridson, and Elmar Robbrecht. 1987. \"The Identity of Lasianthus graciliflorus Bailey (Rubiaceae)\". Kew Bulletin 42(1):209-214. Dried specimens of Lasianthus often shed their flowers and fruit. For this reason, misidentification is common, even in herbaria. The name Lasianthus has been misapplied to Lisianthius (also spelled as \"Lisianthus\" or \"Lisyanthus\"Lena Struwe. undated. Gentian Research Network (website). (See External links below0.), a genus in Gentianaceae. Lasianthus alatus Aublet is a misspelling of Lisyanthus alatus Aublet, a species now placed in Chelonanthus. == Species == Lasianthus contains the following species.

Stipules interpetiolar, usually persistent. - Inflorescences axillary, usually sessile. Flowers small, white. - Calyx with 3 to 6 teeth or lobes; persistent. Corolla with 4 to 6 lobes; throat usually villous. - Stamens 4 to 6, inserted on corolla throat. Anthers dorsifixed. - Stigma with lanceolate or linear lobes. Ovary multilocular. - Ovules basal, erect, 1 per locule. - Fruit a small drupe, usually blue. Pyrenes with thick walls. == History == The generic name Lasianthus is derived from the Greek lasios, \"shaggy, velvety, hairy\", and anthos, \"flower\".Umberto Quattrocchi. 2000. CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names volume II. CRC Press: Boca Raton; New York; Washington,DC;, USA. London, UK. (vol. II). (see External links below). The genus was named by William Jack in 1823.Lasianthus in International Plant Names Index. (see External links below).William Jack. !823. Transactions of the Linnean Society of London 14:125. (See External links below). Some authors have recognized Dressleriopsis and Litosanthes as genera separate from Lasianthus. Dressleriopsis was sunk into Lasianthus in 1982. Litosanthes was erected by Carl Ludwig Blume in 1823. It was synonymized under Lasianthus in 1992.Mohan G. Gagnopadhyay and T. Chakrabarty. 1992. \"A note on the status of Litosanthes Bl. (Rubiaceae)\". Journal of Economic and Taxonomic Botany 16(2):337-338. DNA sequence analysis has not resolved the question of whether Litosanthes is nested within Lasianthus or separate from it. == Affinities == Lasianthus, Saldinia, and Trichostachys form the tribe Lasiantheae in the subfamily Rubioideae. Perama is related to this group and might be included within it.Long-Qian Xiao and Hua Zhu. 2007. \"Paraphyly and phylogenetic relationships in Lasianthus (Rubiaceae) inferred from chloroplast rps16 data\". Botanical Studies 48(2):227-232. (See External links below). Lasiantheae was formerly thought to be close to Psychotria, but is now known to be a basal clade in Rubioideae. It is sister to the large clade containing Coussarea, Psychotria, Spermacoce, and many other genera.Catarina Rydin, Kent Kainulainen, Sylvain G Razafimandimbison, Jenny E E Smedmark, and Birgitta Bremer. 2009. \"Deep divergences in the coffee family and the systematic position of Acranthera\". Plant Systematics and Evolution 278(1-2):101-123. Saprosma and Amaracarpus were traditionally thought to be close to Lasianthus. Saprosma is polyphyletic, with only part of it related to Lasianthus. Amaracarpus is close to Psychotria. The African genera Batopedina and Dirichletia have also been suggested as relatives of Lasianthus. == Taxonomy == Only one molecular phylogenetic study has sampled more than a few species from the tribe Lasiantheae. In that study, 11 species of Lasianthus were sampled, but few relationships were resolved. In 2012, a revision of the Malesian species divided Lasianthus into 3 sections, based on the following type species: L. section Stipulares (Lasianthus stipularis), L. section Lasianthus (Lasianthus cyanocarpus), and L. section Nudiflorae (Lasianthus blumeanus). They did not recognize L.section Pedunculatae (Lasianthus biermanii), which some previous authors had recognized. They considered it to be indistinguishable from L. section Lasianthus. == References == == External links == * Lasianthus Search Page World Checklist of Rubiaceae Index by Team Projects Science Directory Scientific Research and Data Kew Gardens * Lasianthus Names Tropicos Science and Conservation Missouri Botanical Garden * Lasianthus List of Genera Rubiaceae List of families Families and Genera in GRIN Queries GRIN taxonomy for plants * Lasianthus Lasiantheae Rubioideae Rubiaceae Embryophyta Streptophytina Streptophyta Viridiplantae Eukaryota Taxonomy UniProt * Lasianthus Index Nominum Genericorum References NMNH Department of Botany Research and Collections Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History * Revision of Malesian Lasianthus * List of lower taxa Lasianthus.pdf Lasianthus List of lower taxa (genera) Chinese Plant Names Rubiaceae FOC vol. 19 page 2 Family List Flora of China eFloras * Flora of Sri Lanka * Flora of Tropical East Africa At: page 3 Of: Projects At: Science Directory At: Scientific Research and Data At: Science and Conservation At: Home At: About Kew At: Kew Gardens * The Convoluted History of Lisianthus, etc. Eustoma Chironieae Classification overview Gentian Research Network * CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names: D-L Botany & Plant Science Life Science CRC Press * Lasianthus Plant Names IPNI * Lasianthus, page 125 Volume 14 Bibliography Transactions of the Linnean Society of London Titles beginning with \"T\" Titles Biodiversity Heritage Library * Xiao & Zhu 2007 on Lasianthus Volume 48(2) Issue Indices Botanical Studies an international journal Category:Rubiaceae genera Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
