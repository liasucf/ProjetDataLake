    "text": "Halloween Haunt, previously known as \"Fearfest\", is a Halloween event at Canada's Wonderland located in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. It runs after the park's regular operating hours on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evenings in October - up to, and recently in the 2019 season, NOT including Halloween night. It is Canada's largest haunted theme park featuring over 300 monsters, nine walk-through \"maze\" attractions, six uniquely themed atmospheric scare areas, and three live shows. During its operation, the grounds are transformed via decorative props, thematic music, eerie lighting to further create its scary atmosphere. ==History== The haunted theme park concept was first introduced in 2005, then called Fearfest while the park was under the ownership of Paramount Parks. Fearfest at Paramount Canada's Wonderland originally operated on weekday evenings through October, with eight frightening mazes, later on in the years when Paramount sold the park new owners added the \"Skeleton Key\" and \"Fright Lane\". Most of the park's regular rides and attractions (with the exception of Nickelodeon Central, KidZville and Hanna-Barbera Land) continued to be staffed and operated during Fearfest, including the 'Haunted' Thunder Run coaster, which was slightly thematically changed to match the park. The park grounds were divided into three separately themed scare areas - The Curse of Sleepy Hollow, MTV Rockin' Scare, and Backlot Blood Bath - each having 2-3 mazes associated with it. Each maze and scare area generally has its own unique back story, sometimes linking several mazes together. The following year, Paramount extended its regular operating season through the family-oriented Halloween event \"Spooktacular\" in the typically closed child-oriented areas of the park, to match Fearfest's attendance in October. In 2006 the park ran Spooktacular from October 14\u201329 on weekends during the day, and would reopen the park as Fearfest in the evening. With the change in ownership of the park from Paramount to the Cedar Fair Entertainment Company, the Fearfest name was dropped and renamed Halloween Haunt, remaining consistent with similar attractions at other Cedar Fair theme parks across North America. In addition, Spooktacular was not revived for the 2007 operating season. Despite this, Canada's Wonderland still continued regular daytime park hours during the Halloween Haunt run. To replace Spooktacular, the park created Camp Spooky, to fit in with the Peanuts theming of the kids area. With an existing history of running haunted attractions since 1973 at Knott's Berry Farm's event, Knott's Scary Farm, Cedar Fair was able to incorporate four additional mazes to the roster while retiring the Legend of the Lost and Slaughter Street attractions. In 2008, Halloween Haunt saw an extended seasonal run into November, breaking the park's own attendance records for the event. Cedar Fair also retired the MTV Rockin' Scare area, including the Total Request Dead and Ozzburnes mazes in order to introduce three new ones for the season. The \"adult-oriented'\" horror musical show Dead Awakening also opened during the 2008 Halloween Haunt, performing at the Wonderland Theatre. There are currently seven atmospheric scare areas with free-roaming monsters in the park: Gates of Terror, Ghostly Pines, CarnEvil, Wicked Hollow, The Plague and Trick or Treat. A new scare zone, \"Frontier's Revenge\", is being introduced for the 2019 season. ==Current attractions== The park has added new entertainment for the 2019 season. The LED Drumline roams the park, the Halloween Horror Flicks replaces Sinner's Lounge at Canterbury Theatre in The Plague, the Freak Show and The Illusionist share a stage at staggered times in the CarnEvil area, The Gallows features a hanging in The Plague, the Toxic Party Zone is by Behemoth (the pathway connecting Frontier's Revenge and where Orbiter used to stand), and the Radioactive: LED Dance Show is on a stage just in front of Behemoth and Backlot Stunt Coaster. The Fright Lane lanyard/card is valid at all nine mazes. ===Mazes=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! style=\"width:20%;\"|Attraction ! style=\"width:7%;\"|Type ! style=\"width:7%;\"|Opened ! style=\"width:7%;\"|Location |- |Code Red |style=\"text-align:center\"|Maze |style=\"text-align:center\"|2016 |style=\"text-align:center\"|International Street |- |Sci-Fi House |style=\"text- align:center\"|Maze |style=\"text-align:center\"|2013 |style=\"text- align:center\"|Medieval Faire |- |Cornstalkers |style=\"text-align:center\"|Maze |style=\"text-align:center\"|2005 |style=\"text-align:center\"|White Water Canyon |- |The Ruins |style=\"text-align:center\"|Maze |style=\"text-align:center\"|2013 |style=\"text-align:center\"|Wonder Mountain |- |Blackout |style=\"text- align:center\"|Maze |style=\"text-align:center\"|2017 |style=\"text- align:center\"|Wonder Mountain |- |Blood Shed |style=\"text-align:center\"|Maze |style=\"text-align:center\"|2014 |style=\"text-align:center\"|Courtyard |- |Forest of Fear |style=\"text-align:center\"|Maze |style=\"text- align:center\"|2017 |style=\"text-align:center\"|Courtyard |- |Spirit Manor |style=\"text-align:center\"|Maze |style=\"text-align:center\"|2015 |style=\"text- align:center\"|Action Theatre |- |The Crypt |style=\"text-align:center\"|Maze |style=\"text-align:center\"|2018 |style=\"text-align:center\"|Medieval Faire |} ===Scare Zones=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! style=\"width:20%;\"|Attraction ! style=\"width:7%;\"|Type ! style=\"width:7%;\"|Location |- |Gates of Terror |style=\"text- align:center\"|Scarezone |style=\"text-align:center\"|Front Gate |- |CarnEvil |style=\"text-align:center\"|Scare Zone |style=\"text-align:center\"|International Festival |- |Ghostly Pines |style=\"text-align:center\"|Scare Zone |style=\"text- align:center\"|Action Zone |- |The Plague |style=\"text-align:center\"|Scare Zone |style=\"text-align:center\"|Medieval Faire |- |Trick or Treat |style=\"text- align:center\"|Scare Zone |style=\"text-align:center\"|Vortex |- |Wicked Hollow |style=\"text-align:center\"|Scare Zone |style=\"text-align:center\"|Action Zone (by Skyhawk and WindSeeker) |- |Frontier's Revenge |style=\"text- align:center\"|Scare Zone |style=\"text-align:center\"|Yukon Striker Pathway |} ===Shows=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Show !Location !Closest scare zone (or located in) |- |Halloween Horror Flicks |Canterbury Theatre |The Plague |- |Devil's Circus |Coasters in Action Zone |Wicked Hollow |- |Vampire Disco |Medieval Faire |The Plague |- |Freak Show |International Festival |CarnEvil |- |The Gallows |Medieval Faire, outside of Canterbury Theatre |The Plague |- |Toxic Party Zone |Action Zone |Frontier's Revenge |- |Radioactive: LED Dance Show |Action Zone |Frontier's Revenge |- |LED Drumline |Front Gate, Action Zone, and International Showplace |Gates of Terror, Frontier's Revenge, and Wicked Hollow |- |Dixieland Zombie Marching Band |Roaming |Roaming |} == Retired attractions == * Sinner's Lounge - Show (retired 2018) * Bloody Buccaneers - Scarezone (retired 2018) * Club Blood - Maze (retired 2018) * Mysterion The Mind Reader - Show (retired 2018) * Skeleton Crew - Show (retired 2017) * Cryohazard - Scarezone (retired 2017) * Louisiana Scream - Maze (retired 2017) * Streets of The Undead - Maze (retired 2017) * Toxicity - Show (retired 2016) * The Asylum - Maze (retired 2016) * Terror of London - Maze (retired 2016) * Clowns at Midnight - Maze (retired 2015) * Steampunk - Scarezone (retired 2015) * Mother Noose - Maze (retired 2014) * Blood on the Bayou - Maze (retired 2013) * Iron Empire - Maze (retired 2013) * Kingdom of Carnage - Maze (retired 2013) * Red Beard's Rage - Maze (retired 2013) * Blood Drums - Show (retired 2013) * Haunted House 3D - Action Theatre Show (retired 2013) * Miner's Revenge - Maze (retired 2012) * Beyond The Grave - Show (retired 2012) * The Hanging - Show (retired 2012) * Fun House Express - Action Theatre Show (retired 2012) * Elvira's Superstition - Action Theatre Show (retired 2012) * Psycho Circus - Show (retired 2011) * Fangs - Show (retired 2010) * A Midsummer Nights Scream- Maze (retired 2010) * Dead Awakening - Show (retired 2009) * Massacre Manor - Maze (retired 2009) * Slaughter Mill - Maze (retired 2009) * Total Request DEAD - MTV Rockin' Scare Maze (retired 2008) * The Ozzburnes - MTV Rockin' Scare Maze (retired 2008) * Legend of the Lost: The Director's Cut - Backlot Blood Bath Maze (retired 2007) * Slaughter Street Fear Zone - Backlot Blood Bath Maze (retired 2007) * Spooktacular - KidZville/Nickelodeon Central Area (retired 2007) ==See also== * Halloween Haunt (disambiguation), Halloween events at other Cedar Fair parks ==References== == External Sources == * Canada's Wonderland official site * Halloween Haunt official site * Halloween Haunt Map; 2007 Category:Halloween events Category:Canada's Wonderland ",
