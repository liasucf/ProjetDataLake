    "text": "Marvik is a village in Suldal municipality in Rogaland county, Norway. The village is located along the Sandsfjorden on the southern coast of the Ropeid peninsula. The village is a commercial centre of the peninsula, having a general store, primary school, marina, library, and Marvik Chapel. The Sandsfjord Bridge lies a short distance east of Marvik. It opened in 2016. This bridge gives residents of Marvik a long, ferry-free route to the municipal centre of Sand (without the bridge, it used to be a drive around several fjords to reach Sand without using a ferry). ==References== Category:Villages in Rogaland Category:Suldal ",
