It was seen as the least prestigious of the big three Kensington department stores. ==Early history== Pontings started out as a small drapery business by Thomas Ponting in Archer Street, just off Westbourne Grove, as Thomas H Ponting & Co. Thomas was one of four brothers and had been born in Gloucester. By 1868, the business had moved to 123 Westbourne Grove and Thomas had been joined by his brothers, William, Sydney and John.P.O.D.: Peel, op. cit., pp. 39\u201340.

The profits made from this venture saw the business expand into 127 (1876) and 123 Kensington High Street (1890). The business had changed from just a millinery and drapery to a seller of retail fancy goods and silks.Adburgham, op. cit., pp. 164\u20135.

Between 1899 and 1901, Pontings replaced their old premises on Kensington High Street with a new building designed by Arthur Sykes, which was completed in two stages and cost them \u00a314,000. The new building had a large basement and four storeys above and was attached to Scarsdale House, which had not been touched.The Warehouseman and Draper, 1 July 1899, pp. 891\u20132: B. 20 May 1899, p. 513.

Pontings purchased the whole of the western side of the arcade before construction had started. However, the expansion of the business and the building programme had seen the company over-extend itself, and in December 1906, Pontings went into liquidation. John Barker & Co., a fellow Kensington department store, purchased the business for \u00a384,00 in April 1907.B. 30 July 1910, p. 128: P.R.O., BT 31/7991/57434: Peel, op. cit., p. 40: HF 8/1/5.

Barkers's Zeeta business and stores on the north side of Kensington High Street were closed before Pontings, the first of the department stores went, being closed down in 1970. The name however lived on, as the unsold stock from the closing down sale was transferred to Barker's own lower ground floor and was called Pontings Bargain Basement before it was renamed in 1974.http://www.housefraserarchive.ac.uk/company/?id=c0562 ==After Pontings== The building became a market known as Kensington Super Store, before English Property Corporation redeveloped the site. The original building was pulled down and replaced by Pemberton House on Kensington High Street (1976\u201378) and Kensley House (1982\u201384) on Wright's Lane, both office blocks, while at the rear was built a block of flats called William Cobbett House.Information kindly supplied by the English Property Corporation and the GMW Partnership.
