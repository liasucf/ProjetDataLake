    "text": "Rozmowy ze Stanis\u0142awem Lemem (literal translation: Conversations with Stanis\u0142aw Lem) is a book-length interview of Polish science fiction writer Stanis\u0142aw Lem conducted by literary critic and historian Stanis\u0142aw Bere\u015b in 1981\u20131982 and published in book format in 1987. The second, more comprehensive edition was published in 2002 under the title Tako rzecze\u2026 Lem (Thus Spoke... Lem).\"Thus Spoke Lem\" at Lem's official website ==Development== The interview lasted a year, from November 1981 to August 1982, and was interrupted by the beginning of martial law in Poland. The book's publication was delayed as both Lem and Bere\u015b were seen as involved with the opposition and sympathetic towards Western powers. Parts of the interview were first published in West Germany and Poland in the monthly literary magazine Odra. The book was published in 1986 in Germany by Insel Verlag under the title Lem \u00fcber Lem. Gespr\u00e4che (\"Lem about Lem. Conversations\").\"Rozmowy ze Stanis\u0142awem Lemem\", at Stanis\u0142aw Bere\u015b website In 1987, the book was published by Polish publisher Wydawnictwo Literackie, but in a low-quality edition of 10,000 copies; furthermore, as the book was subject to significant government censorship, in patricular, the parts were removed that discussed the Polish government's declaration of the martial law and the Soviet occupation of the city of Lw\u00f3w, where Lem lived during his youth. The second, expanded edition included fragments censored from the previous edition as well as a new chapter based on more recent interviews with Lem carried out by Bere\u015b after the September 11 attacks in the United States. The title of the book was also changed to Tako rzecze\u2026 Lem (Thus spoke... Lem), an allusion to Thus Spoke Zarathustra and the title initially intended for the book. Reviewing the second edition in 2002, Wojciech Orli\u0144ski called it \"the most interesting of all monographies about Lem\" and a \"brilliant interview\". ==Content== The book is composed of the following chapters: * Czas nie ca\u0142kiem utracony (1987 edition title) / Czas nieutracony (2002 edition title). Lit. Time [not fully] lost. This chapter was partially censored in the 1987 edition, which have removed parts about Soviet- occupied era Lw\u00f3w of WWII where Lem grew up. * W paj\u0119czej sieci. Lit In the spider's web. * O Golemie osobno (1987 edition title) / Golem (2002 edition title). Lit Separately about Golem. * Rozczarowania filmowe. Lit. Film disappointments. * Gusta i dysgusta. Lit. Likes and dislikes. * Ksi\u0119ga skarg i wniosk\u00f3w. Lit. Book of complains and suggestions. * W cywilizacyjnej jamie. Lit. In the cave of civilization. * Czarna bezwyj\u015bciowo\u015b\u0107 sytuacji. Lit. Black no-exits of the situation. This chapter, discussing recent events in Poland, was entirely removed by censors in the 1987 edition. * Wyja\u015bnia\u0107 \u015bwiat. Lit. Explain the world. * Pasja filozofowania. Lit. Passion of philosophizing. * Lube czasy. Lit. Good times. This is one of the three new chapters added to the 2002 edition. * Wizja lokalna. Lit. Local vision. This is one of the three new chapters added to the 2002 edition. * Summa, czyli panta rhei. Lit. Summa, or panta rhei. This is one of the three new chapters added to the 2002 edition. ==Influence== While Bere\u015b' interview was never fully translated to English, in the early 1990s Lem met with the literary scholar and critic Peter Swirski for a series of extensive interviews, published with other critical materials and translations in English as A Stanislaw Lem Reader (1997). In 2005 Bere\u015b published another book-length interview, Historia i fantastyka, this time with Polish fantasy writer Andrzej Sapkowski. Wojciech Orli\u0144ski in his review of Historia i fantastyka notes that comparing it with the Lem's interview from 1980s it allows for a study of how Polish science fiction and fantasy has changed over those two decades. ==See also== *Bibliography of Stanis\u0142aw Lem#Interviews, other interviews with Lem ==References== Category:1987 non-fiction books Category:Stanis\u0142aw Lem interviews Category:Polish non-fiction books Category:Censored books ",
