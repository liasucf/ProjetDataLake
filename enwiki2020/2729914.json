    "text": "A setar (, ), also spelled and romanized as setaar or set\u00e2r, is an Iranian musical instrument. It is a member of the lute family. It is played with the index finger of the right hand. The range of the setar spans more than two and a half octaves. At some point in the 18th century, musicians added a fourth string, which most of the time is tuned to the same pitch as the bass string. The setar has 25\u201328 moveable frets. Frets are usually made of animal intestines (\"gut\"), although in the past strings were made of silk. Some modern commercial models feature frets made of nylon. The setar originated in Persia before the spread of Islam,The Stringed Instrument Database and is related to the tanbur. However, in recent centuries, the setar has evolved into something more closely resembling the tar, both in tuning and playing style. ==Etymology== The Persian word \u0633\u0647\u200c\u062a\u0627\u0631 ' is a combination of \u0633\u0647 '\u2014meaning \"three\"\u2014and \u062a\u0627\u0631 '\u2014meaning \"string\", therefore the word gives the meaning of \"three-stringed\" or \"tri-stringed\". ==Uyghur variant== The Satar (; , S\u00e0t\u01ce'\u011br) is an important instrument in 12 muqam. It is a bowed lute with 13 strings, one raised bowing string and 12 sympathetic strings, tuned to the mode of the muqam or piece being played. ==Notable setarists== Hossein Alizadeh playing Setar * Hossein Alizadeh * Mohammad-Reza Lotfi * At\u00e2 Jangouk * Kayhan Kalhor * Mirza Abdollah * Sa'id Hormozi * Yusef Forutan * Ahmad Ebadi * Abolhasan Saba * Dariush Safvat * Mojtaba Mirzadeh * Jalal Zolfonun * Dariush Talai * Massoud Shaari * Behdad Babaei * Hafez Nazeri * Abdollah Alijani Ardeshir * Mehdi Aminian Hafez Nazeri Playing the Setar, 2001 ==See also== *Music of Iran *Barbat (lute) *Ba\u011flama *Sitar ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== Category:Necked bowl lutes Category:Azerbaijani musical instruments Category:Iranian inventions Category:Persian musical instruments ",
