    "text": "\"SOS\" is the first posthumous single by Swedish DJ Avicii featuring co- production from Albin Nedler and Kristoffer Fogelmark, and vocals from American singer Aloe Blacc. It was released on 10 April 2019 and is included on his posthumous third studio album Tim, released on 6 June 2019. The single is also his second number-one (and his first posthumously charted single to reach number-one), as well as Blacc's first, on Billboards Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart, in its 1 June 2019 issue.\"Avicii Advances to No. 1 on Dance/Mix Show Airplay Chart With 'SOS'\" from Billboard (30 May 2019) The song was produced by Albin Nedler, Kristoffer Fogelmark, and Avicii. It features an interpolation of \"No Scrubs\" by TLC, written by Tameka Cottle, Kandi Burruss, and Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs. The song was released alongside a video featuring comments on the Avicii Memory Board, as well as a behind-the-scenes video that was released two hours before release. It debuted at number one on the singles chart in Sweden on two days of sales. ==Background== The song was completed by a team of writers and producers following Avicii's death in April 2018. It was said to be \"75\u201380% done\" at the time of his death. Co-producers Kristoffer Fogelmark and Albin Nedler confirmed that after Avicii's death, they received the MIDI file for the song that he had produced, and said that all the sounds and notes in the song were from Avicii himself without any additional production. The only additional production done on the track was for Aloe Blacc's vocals. Though Avicii had suggested Aloe Blacc as a potential singer for the song, Blacc recorded his vocals after Avicii's death. ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from Tidal. * Albin Nedler \u2013 songwriter, producer, vocal producer, engineer, keyboards, programming * Kristoffer Fogelmark \u2013 songwriter, producer, vocal producer, engineer, keyboards, programming * Avicii \u2013 songwriter, producer, keyboards, programming * Tameka Cottle \u2013 songwriter * Kandi Burruss \u2013 songwriter * Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs \u2013 songwriter * Aloe Blacc \u2013 vocals * Marcus Thunberg Wessel \u2013 engineer * Richard \"Segal\" Huredia \u2013 engineer * Kevin Grainger \u2013 mixing and mastering ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia Dance (ARIA) | 1 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| China Airplay/FL (Billboard) | 5 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Colombia (National-Report) | 76 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Croatia (HRT) | 1 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ecuador (National Report) | 23 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Euro Digital Songs (Billboard) | 2 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Germany Dance (Official German Charts) | 1 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Greece (IFPI)IFPI Greek Digital Singles (International) | 17 |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Latvia (LAIPA) | 6 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania (AGATA) | 6 |- !scope=\"row\"| Lebanon (Lebanese Top 20) | 5 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Mexico Ingles Airplay (Billboard) | 35 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Netherlands (Mega Top 50)\"Lijst van 20-04-2019 - MEGA TOP 50\" (in Dutch).
