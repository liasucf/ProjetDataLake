    "text": "Inch Abbey is a railway station on the Downpatrick & County Down Railway. It is the terminus of the railway's Northern Line and serves Inch Abbey, a ruined monastery and local tourist attraction of Downpatrick. The Inch Abbey line follows the original Belfast & County Down Railway out of Downpatrick, but shortly after it crosses the River Quoile, the current line leaves the original alignment and diverges north. Most of the DCDR's trains run to here from Downpatrick Railway Station to Inch, such as the Easter, St. Patrick's Day and Summer steam trains. On these days, a buffet train is parked in the bay platform and passenger trains use the through platform. ==External links== *Downpatrick & Co.
