He secured his graduate and master's degrees in Urdu from Patna University after which he obtained his doctoral degree in 1965. His doctoral thesis, Evolution of Urdu Literature in Bihar, has since been published as a book. Aajiz continued his association with Patna University by joining the institution as a member of its Urdu language faculty and retired as a professor of the department. After retirement, he was appointed as the Chairman of the Urdu Advisory Committee, Government of Bihar, a post he held till his death. Aajiz began writing poems at the age of 17 and started appearing in mushairas from 1949. His first book of ghazals was published in 1976 and the book was released at Vigyan Bhawan by the then President of India, Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed. This was followed by several publications such as Jub Fasle Baharan Aai Thi (When the spring arrived), Woh Jo Shayri Ka Sabab Hua, Jab Fasl Bahar Aayei Thi and Jahan Khushboo Hi Khusboo Thi. His mushairas have been hosted in many places including Dallas, US. ==Publications== Some of his selected collection of poems and ghazals are: * Woh Jo Shaayri Ka Sabab Hua (The person I did the poetry for) * Jab Fasle Bahar Aayei Thi (When the spring arrived) * Jahan Khushboo Hi Khushboo Thi (Where There Was Plenty of Fragrance) ==Death and legacy== Aajiz, who had four sons and two daughters, died on 14 February 2015 at Hazaribagh in Jharkhand, at the age of 94. After the funeral at Gandhi Maidan, Patna which was attended to by thousands of people, his mortal remains were buried at Telhara, his native place. Firaq Gorakhpuri, another eminent Urdu poet, sent him a message while lying on his deathbed in 1982, in which he respectfully said that he felt jealous of Kalim Aajiz due to the ease in which Kalim Aajiz could express his thoughts through his verses. ==See also== * Fuzail Ahmad Nasiri * Ghazal ==References== ==External links== * Category:Recipients of the Padma Shri in literature & education Category:1920 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Educators from Bihar Category:Indian Muslims Category:Indian male poets Category:Urdu poets from India Category:People from Nalanda district Category:Patna University alumni Category:Patna University faculty Category:20th-century Indian poets Category:Poets from Bihar Category:20th-century Indian male writers ",
