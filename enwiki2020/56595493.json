He held pacifist views, and was the first Treasurer and a founding member of the Peace Society. ==Life== He was the son of William Scott (died 1775) and his wife Elizabeth Watts. At age 12 he was apprenticed to a City of London jeweller. He went to work for a private bank. When Henry Thornton joined it during the 1780s, the name was Down, Thornton & Free, or just Down & Co. In 1815 both Thornton and Richard Down, an original partner, died, and a new partnership was formed that involved Scott. It traded as Pole, Thornton, Free, Down & Scott, with Henry Sykes Thornton as one of the incoming partners. Initially a Calvinist of the Church of England, Scott became a Calvinistic Methodist. He attended the Tabernacle Chapel, City Road, Moorfields, He later joined a Congregationalist chapel in Stoke Newington. In 1816 he was one of the founding committee of the Peace Society. In a tract of 1817, his address is given as Islington. The bank failed in the Panic of 1825. Scott suffered a large personal loss. A funeral sermon for Scott was preached at Stoke Newington by the Congregationalist minister John Jefferson (1795\u20131882). His place as the Peace Society's Treasurer was taken by Samuel Gurney (1786\u20131856). ==Works== *War inconsistent with the doctrine and example of Jesus Christ: in a letter to a friend This work by Scott has been called a \"pioneering pacifist text\". It was originally published nearly pseudonymously in 1796, as \"I. Scott\". At that time it was noticed by the Analytical Review and Critical Review. It is now recognised as the first London pacifist pamphlet with origins other than the Society of Friends. It was adopted as a tract, twenty years later, by the Peace Society, with a third edition in 1818. ==Family== Scott married, firstly, Mary Whinnell, daughter of Benjamin Whinnell of Wimborne; and secondly Anne Ley.
