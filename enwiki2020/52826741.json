Fitted with a high resolution infrared camera, the RSV can also be considered as an autonomous platform for surveillance and security of sensitive areas (ports protection, specific areas monitoring or observation of unsafe events for humans). With an autonomy varying from 4h to 48h, the RSV is a size-optimized and user-friendly USV, remotely controlled or autopiloted. Data measured are transmitted and visualized/controlled in real time by the distant operator. The range of RSV allows operating: * in difficult access areas (dams, rivers, shallow water, canals, etc.), * offshore. The RSV allows ROV deployment for subsea observation and monitoring. RSV are manufactured and produced in France by Marine Tech SAS. == References == Category:Unmanned surface vehicles Category:Hydrography Category:Surveying ",
