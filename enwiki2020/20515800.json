As of 1956, DISZ had 14 000 local organizations and a total membership of around 800 000. During its existence, DISZ oversaw the pioneer movement in Hungary. DISZ published Szabad ifj\u00fas\u00e1g weekly from October 1950 to July 1951, and daily from August 1951 to October 1956. Within DISZ oppositional tendencies emerged. DISZ set up the 'Pet\u0151fi Circle', which became a centre of dissidence against the Hungarian government.McDougall, Alan. Youth Politics in East Germany: The Free German Youth Movement, 1946-1968.
