The highway turned north from SR 25 and followed the Columbia River upstream as well a railroad owned by the Kettle Falls International Railway. The highway traveled northeast, then east through a series of hairpin turns before turning north to Boundary, an unincorporated community in Stevens County, where SR 251 entered Canadian customs and continued into British Columbia as British Columbia Highway 22A (BC 22A). ==History== SR 251 was once a county road connecting Northport with British Columbia that has existed since at least 1912. In 1913, it became part of the Inland Empire Highway, but was removed in 1915. The road was transferred to county maintenance after removal from the state highway system. In 1931, it was officially added to the state highway system as part of an extension of from Kettle Falls to British Columbia. In 1937, it became Secondary State Highway 22A (SSH 22A), a branch of (PSH 22). When Washington renumbered its highways in 1964 and switched to a new system, SSH 22A became SR 251 and PSH 22 became SR 25. SR 251 remained one of only four state highways in Washington that remained gravel roads. In 1983, SR 251 was removed from the state highway system and control was relinquished to Stevens County. After it was turned over, Stevens County continues to maintain the roadway and no realignments or significant events have occurred. ==Major intersections== ==References== ==External links== *Highways of Washington State 251 ",
