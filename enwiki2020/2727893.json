For instance, the CIA and FBI were involved in numerous large-scale operations targeting US activist groups, whose mail was opened and photographed. In one such programme, over 215,000 letters were opened. In the United Kingdom, the Special Investigations Unit of the General Post Office was responsible for postal interception.Saunders, Frances Stonor. \"Stuck on the Flypaper: MI5 and the Hobsbawm File\".
