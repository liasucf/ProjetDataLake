    "text": "A pet trust is a legal arrangement to provide care for a pet after its owner dies. A pet trust falls under trust law and is one option for pet owners who want to provide for their pets after they pass away. Alternatives include honorary bequests made through a will and contractual arrangements with the caregiver. Pet trusts stipulate that in the event of a grantor\u2019s disability or death a trustee will hold property (cash, for example) \u201cin trust\u201d for the benefit of the grantor\u2019s pets. The \u201cgrantor\u201d (also called a settlor or trustor in some states) is the person who creates the trust, which may take effect during a person\u2019s lifetime or at death. Payments to designated caregivers will be made on a regular basis. ==History== The development of pet trusts is part of the animal rights movement. ==United States== All U.S. states have passed laws that allow some form of pet trust. Some states allow a pet trust to continue for the life of the pet, without regard to a maximum duration of 21 years. This is particularly advantageous for companion animals who have longer life expectancies than cats and dogs, such as horses and parrots. ==See also== * Rachel Hirschfeld ==References== ==External links== *\"Providing For Your Pets In The Event of Your Death or Hospitalization\".
