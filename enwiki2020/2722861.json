    "text": "The W0KIE Satellite Radio Network () was a mostly talk radio network, listenable via C-band satellite. It operated, almost continuously, from 1996 to 2007. (It was named after the amateur radio callsign of its owner.) The programming was of a less structured nature than traditional talk radio. There was special emphasis on programming for amateur radio operators, satellite TV enthusiasts and the sight impaired. Although not the primary focus of the network, some show hosts did play music--a lot of which was not heard on traditional radio. Comedy and plays--old and new--were also often featured. The format was reminiscent of free-form programming heard during the formative years of FM radio. ==History== *5 April 1996 W0KIE was born on SBS6 Ku-band transponder 13b (12031 MHz) originating via POTS extended fidelity audio feed to the Creek Nation Bingo uplink in Tulsa, Oklahoma. W0KIE uplinked nightly during a 1-hour window (2 bingo games on the video carrier) and a 1/2 hour window (1 bingo game on the video carrier.) *18 June 1996 Houston AMSAT Net joins the W0KIE Network. *Summer 1998 W0KIE uplink moves to Indian bingo uplink in Concho, Oklahoma north of El Reno, Oklahoma. The uplink signal quality would vary at times when the Oklahoma wind rocked the uplink dish. *7 December 1998 W0KIE moves to GE-1 (W1) on the Wisdom Network video carrier, Transponder 12B, 5.7 MHz audio. Uplinking starts around the clock from Bluefield, WV. Audio to uplink using RealAudio encoding via POTS dialup greatly improving audio fidelity. W0KIE retransmitted in FM band spectrum on TCI cable in Tulsa.

Policy at the new location allows internet access via DSL. A computer is installed to carry even higher fidelity audio to the subcarrier. *Summer 2005 Another subcarrier becomes available. W0KIE is now stereo! *8 December 2005 W0KIE moves to Intelsat Americas 6 (IA6, aka T6) 93\u00b0W, C-band analog, transponder 1, 6.2 and 6.8 MHz wide band audio on an encrypted adult channel video carrier.

As of 1 December 2007, W0KIE Satellite Radio Network is off the air, permanently. A contingent of W0KIE programmers went on to form the SkyScanner Satellite Radio Network (named in honour of the late Dean Spratt), buying airtime on Access America (a DVB audio channel, on Galaxy 25 (aka T5) 97.0\u00b0W Ku-band). This arrangement was dissolved in January 2012, leaving the group's presence in the hands of Radio Free Dishnuts\u2014an internet-only radio service. ==External links== *Radio Free Dishnuts & SkyScanner home page Category:American radio networks Category:Satellite radio stations ",
