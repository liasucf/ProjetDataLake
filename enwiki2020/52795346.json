    "text": "P4-t-Bu is a readily accessible chemical from the group of neutral, peralkylated sterically hindered polyaminophosphazenes, which are extremely strong bases but very weak nucleophiles. P4-t-Bu can also be regarded as tetrameric triaminoiminophosphorane of the basic structure (H2N)3P=N-H.

The transfer of the hygroscopic and readily water-soluble hydrochlorides and the liquid free bases into the tetrafluoroborates, which are difficult to solubilize in water, facilitate the handling of the substances considerably. The relatively uncomplicated convergent synthesis with easily accessible reactants and very good yields of the intermediates make P4-t-Bu an interesting phosphazene superbase. == Properties == P4-t-Bu is one of the strongest neutral nitrogenous bases with an extrapolated pKa value of 42.1 in acetonitrile and is compared to the strong base DBU with a pKa value of 24.3 by 18 orders of magnitude more basic. The compound is very well soluble in non-polar solvents, such as hexane, toluene or tetrahydrofuran, and is usually commercially available as a 0.8 to 1 molar solution in hexane. Already in weakly acidic media protonation produces the extremely delocalized and soft P4-t-Bu-H cation and causes besides a very strong solubilization effect also an extreme acceleration of addition reactions even at temperatures below -78 \u00b0C. P4-t-Bu owes its extraordinarily high basicity with low nucleophilicity to its very high steric hindrance and the involvement of many donor groups in conjugation with the spatially demanding structure of the cation formed by protonation. P4-t-Bu is an extremely hygroscopic solid which is thermally stable up to 120 \u00b0C and chemically stable to (dry) oxygen and bases. Traces of water and protic impurities can be eliminated by addition of bromoethane. The base is both very hydrophilic and very lipophilic and can be recovered easily and almost completely from reaction mixtures by the formation of the sparingly soluble tetrafluoroborate salt. Because of its extremely weak Lewis basicity, the cation of P4-t-Bu suppresses typical side reactions of metal organyls (such as aldol condensations) as can be caused by lithium amides such as lithium diisopropylamide (LDA). == Applications == The neutral superbase P4-t-Bu is superior to ionic bases if those are sensitive to oxidation or side reactions (such as acylation) when they cause solubility problems or Lewis acid catalysed side reactions (such as aldol reactions, epoxy ring opening etc). The dehydrohalogenation of n-alkyl bromides yields the alkene, such as the reaction 1-bromooctane with P4-t-Bu which yields 1-octene almost quantitatively (96%) under mild conditions, compared to the potassium tert-butoxide/18-crown-6 system with only 75% yield. Alkylations on weakly acidic methylene groups (e.g. in the case of carboxylic esters or nitriles) proceed with high yield and selectivity. For example, by the reaction of 8-phenylmenthylphenylacetate with iodoethane in the presence of P4-t-Bu only the monoethyl derivative in the Z configuration is obtained in 95% yield. : Monoethylierung von 8-Phenylmenthyl-phenylacetat Succinonitrile reacts with iodoethane in the presence of P4-t-Bu in 98% yield to give the tetraethyl derivative without undergoing a Thorpe-Ziegler reaction to form a cyclic \u03b1-ketonitrile. : Tetraalkylierung von 1,2-Dinitrilen Trifluoromethylation of ketones (such as benzophenone) is also possible at room temperature in good yields up to 84% with the inert fluoroform (HFC-23) in the presence of P4-t-Bu and tris(trimethylsilyl)amine. : Trifluormethylierung von Benzophenon mit Fluoroform Intramolecular cyclization of ortho-alkynylphenyl ethers leads in the presence of P4-t-Bu under mild conditions without metal catalysts to substituted benzofurans. : Cyclisierungen mit P4-t-Bu zu Benzofuranen Due to its extreme basicity it was suggested early on that P4-t-Bu should be suited as an initiator for anionic polymerization. With the ethyl acetate/P4-t-Bu initiator system, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) with narrow polydispersity and molar masses up to 40,000 g\u00b7mol\u22121 could be obtained in THF. : Anionische Polymerisation von MMA zu PMMA Anionic polymerization of Ethylene oxide with the initiator system n-Butyllithium/P4-t-Bu yields well-defined Polyethylene oxides with low polydispersity. Cyclic siloxanes (such as hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane or decamethylcyclopentasiloxane) can also be polymerized with catalytic amounts of P4-t-Bu and water or silanols as initiators under good molecular weight control to thermally very stable polysiloxanes having decomposition temperatures of >450 \u00b0C. Because of its extreme basicity, P4-t-Bu eagerly absorbs water and carbon dioxide, both of which inhibit anionic polymerization. Heating to temperatures >100 \u00b0C removes CO2 and water and restores the anionic polymerization. The extreme hygroscopy of the phosphazene base P4-t-Bu as a substance and in solutions requires a great effort for storage and handling and prevents its broader use. == References == : Category:Phosphorus compounds : Category:Nitrogen(\u22123) compounds : Category:Non-nucleophilic bases : Category:Superbases : Category:Tert-butyl compounds ",
