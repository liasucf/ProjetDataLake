It was established in 1989 with seed money of $100,000 from Pamela Denoon and a trust fund in her name. It was to be independent of political parties and was to form partnerships with other women's organisations. Its purpose was to ensure that women's history, knowledge, and wisdom would be accessible to new generations of women, and to advance and protect Australian women's interest in all spheres of life. == See also == * Convict women in Australia * List of Australian women artists * List of Australian women writers * List of Australian sportswomen * Women and government in Australia * Women in the Australian military ==References== ==External links== * *National Federation for Australian women: website Category:2000 establishments in Australia Category:Databases in Australia Category:Online databases Category:Australian women Category:Women's organisations based in Australia ",
