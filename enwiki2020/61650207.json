    "text": "The William Jasper Johnson House is a historic house at the junction of Lakeshore Road and Honeysuckle Avenue in Bull Shoals, Arkansas. Located just north of the junction, it is a modest single-story frame structure, finished in drop siding and resting on stone piers. Its form is that of a typical vernacular Ozark single pen, with a side gable roof and shed-roof porch across the front. The house was built about 1900 by William Jasper Johnson, who had married the daughter of a prominent local landowner. It is one of the few surviving reminders of the area's early settlement history. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Marion County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1900 Category:Houses in Marion County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Marion County, Arkansas Category:Single pen architecture ",
