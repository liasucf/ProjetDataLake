    "text": "Adriano Tilgher (born 1 October 1947 in Taranto) is an Italian far right politician. Tilgher began his career as a member of the Italian Social Movement, although in his youth he was also associated with the extremist National Vanguard, and attempted to refound it in 1970. He was given a prison sentence for what was judged an attempt to refound the Fascist Party.Alfio Bernabei, \"Berlusconi Paves the Way For Extreme Right to Enter Government\", Searchlight, No. 370, April 2006, p. 34 In 1987 he founded the Lega Nazionalpopolare, later rebranded as Alternativa Nazional Popolare. Both movements proved short-lived and lacking in support. After giving up on the idea of leading his own movement he joined radical Fiamma Tricolore (a splinter group of the newly constituted National Alliance) in 1996. He was, however, expelled from Fiamma Tricolore in 1997 for his criticism of the leadership of Pino Rauti and in September of that year he set up his own party, Fronte Nazionale, initially in imitation of the Front National, whose leader Jean-Marie Le Pen Tilgher invited to Rome during the elections of that year.Italy , Stephen Roth Institute report 1997-98 The party changed its name to Fronte Sociale Nazionale and was part of Alessandra Mussolini's Alternativa Sociale coalition until that group dissolved after a poor showing in the 2006 general election.Alfio Bernabei, \"Mussolini Repositions Herself After Election Setback\", Searchlight, No. 372, June 2006, p. 34 He subsequently formed an alliance with The Right in 2008. Tilgher has been associated with Stefano Delle Chiaie and 1994 co-authored a book with him entitled Un meccanismo diabolico: Stragi Servizi segreti Magistrati.Anna Cento Bull, Italian neofascism: the strategy of tension and the politics of nonreconciliation, Berghahn Books, 2007, p. 133 The book dealt with what the authors claimed has been their victimisation by the Italian legal system.Pierpaolo Antonello, Alan O'Leary, Imagining Terrorism: The Rhetoric and Representation of Political Violence in Italy 1969-2009, MHRA, 2009, p. 189 ==External links== * Official site ==References== Category:1947 births Category:Italian neo-fascists Category:Italian politicians Category:Living people Category:National Front (Italy, 1997) politicians Category:The Right (Italy) politicians Category:Tricolour Flame politicians ",
