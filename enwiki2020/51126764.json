    "text": "{| |} BRP Ramon Alcaraz (PS-16) is the second ship of the Gregorio del Pilar- class offshore patrol vessels of the Philippine Navy. From 1968 to 2012, she was known as and served the United States Coast Guard as a high endurance cutter. She was decommissioned on 30 March 2012 and acquired by the Philippines under the Excess Defense Articles and the Foreign Assistance Act. She is named after Commodore Ramon Alcaraz, a Filipino Naval officer and World War II hero best known for receiving a Silver Star for heroism and gallantry during World War II. He is also known for being one of the first officers of the Armed Forces of the Philippines to criticize the Marcos dictatorship; and for the concept proposal which would make him the \"father\" of the Philippine Marine Corps. She was originally designated as \"PF-16\" from 2012 to mid-2016. Then the Navy adopted a new code designation system leading to her being redesignated as \"FF-16\". In February 2019, the Navy downgraded the status of the entire class from frigate to patrol ship and redesignated her to \"PS-16\". ==Design== The ship was designed with a high level of habitability and provides fairly comfortable accommodations, including air conditioning. ===Propulsion=== Ramon Alcaraz employs the shipboard application of aircraft gas turbine jet engines with the use of controllable pitch propellers. She is equipped with two Pratt & Whitney gas turbines and can propel the ship at speeds up to . Ramon Alcaraz also has two Fairbanks-Morse diesel engines, capable of driving the ship economically at for up to without refueling. A retractable/rotatable bow propulsion unit provides manoeuvrability in tight situations. ===Armament=== Prior to turn-over to the Philippine Navy, the ship was armed with a Mk.75 Oto Melara 76 mm Compact main gun, two Mk.38 25 mm Bushmaster chain guns at midships, and a Phalanx CIWS system aft. The CIWS and chain guns were removed prior to its turn-over, with the Mk.75 gun remaining. The Philippine Navy then purchased two new Mk.38 Mod.2 25 mm Bushmaster Autocannons to replace the mounts removed by the US Coast Guard. These were already installed as of January 25, 2015. ===Flight support=== Ramon Alcaraz has a flight deck and hangar capable of handling helicopters. A newly acquired naval helicopter (an AgustaWestland AW109 Power) made its shipboard deployment on May 21, 2014. ===Modernization=== The Philippine Navy plans to modernize the entire ship of the class, with an initial program to upgrade the ship's sensors, and another program to improve its weapon systems. Several systems were acquired through US Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Foreign Military Financing (FMF), which includes the BAE Systems Mk. 38 Mod. 2 machine gun system (already installed), the SAAB AN/SPS-77 Sea Giraffe AMB 3D air/surface search radar, and the FLIR Systems SeaFLIR 230 Electro-Optical/Infra-Red Camera. Meanwhile, the Philippine Navy will launch a program to acquire, install and integrate several other sensors into the ship, as part of the Horizon 2 phase of the Revised AFP Modernization Program. Among those to be acquired are new Combat Management System (CMS), Hull Mounted Sonar (HMS), and a Radar Electronic Support Measures (R-ESM). Future upgrades are planned to install defensive and offensive missile systems and torpedo launchers, although funding is still being secured and might only be included in the next phase of the Navy's modernization program. ==History== ===US Coast Guard service and transfer to the Philippine Navy=== The ship was first launched in 1968 and served for decades as the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Dallas (WHEC-716) before being given to the Philippines. The ship was scheduled to be transferred to the Philippines as an excess defense article through the Foreign Assistance Act via a \"hot transfer\" in May 2012. The Dallas was formally decommissioned on 30 March 2012, and the US Coast Guard removed the ship's guns and other equipment. On 6 May 2012 during the 70th commemoration of the Fall of Bataan, President Benigno Aquino III announced the naming of the ex-USCGC Dallas to BRP Ramon Alcaraz (PF-16) in honor of the World War II hero and officer of the Philippine Navy. Commodore Ramon \"Monching\" Alcaraz commanded one of the Philippine Offshore Patrol's Q-boat Q-112 Abra during World War II which shot down 3 Japanese aircraft. The ex-Dallas was formally transferred to the Philippine government on 22 May 2012 during a ceremony at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center Pier Papa in North Charleston, South Carolina. The ship was turned over to its Filipino crew, with Capt. Ernesto Baldovino as its first commanding officer. The ship's crew had been in the US for several weeks prior to the transfer for training aboard other Hamilton-class ships operated by the US Coast Guard. Ramon Alcaraz was scheduled to be refitted at the expense of the Philippine Navy prior to sailing to the Philippines. The ship's transfer cost was pegged at Php 450 million (around US$10 million as of 2012), while operation costs will be similar to its sister ship, . An additional US$5 million was allocated for installation of additional equipment, different from her sister ship Gregorio del Pilar. The ship will have better fire control and weapons systems than Gregorio del Pilar. The ship was originally expected to leave Charleston, South Carolina for the Philippines in January 2013 but it was delayed. The ship finally departed Charleston harbor at 10:00 AM on 10 June 2013. She reached the Atlantic-side entrance of the Panama Canal and crossed its entire stretch on 17 June. Ramon Alcaraz continued her journey across the Pacific Ocean and was scheduled for port visits at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii, and at Guam. before reaching Manila by 3 August 2013. On August 1, 2013, Ramon Alcaraz entered Philippine waters. Her official arrival ceremony was held Subic Bay on August 6. On November 22, 2013, she was commissioned as BRP Ramon Alcaraz (PF-16) at Pier 15 in Manila's South Harbor. After commissioning, she sailed to Tacloban City to transport about 200 tons of relief goods, water purification systems, and navy personnel who helped with relief efforts following Typhoon Haiyan. Around mid-2016, the Philippine Navy started calling the ship in its new code designation FF-16, together with its sister ship BRP Gregorio del Pilar which was re-designated as FF-15, and the upcoming BRP Andres Bonifacio designated as FF-17.USCG Boutwell to be formally transferred to PN, to be renamed BRP Andres Bonifacio In March 2017, the Philippine Navy sent the Ramon Alcaraz to patrol the Benham Rise, which is part of Philippine territorial waters, after a Chinese survey ship was sighted in the area for several days. ===Middle East and Indian Ocean deployment=== In January 2020, the Ramon Alcaraz along with the strategic sealift vessel were deployed to the Middle East to repatriate overseas Filipino workers there during the 2019-2020 Persian Gulf crisis between the United States and Iran. The two naval ships arrived in Muscat, Oman on February 6 after a layover in Sri Lanka, but tensions in the Gulf region have already eased by that date and were told by Philippine Navy officials to stay put. They left Oman on April 21 bound for Cochin, India to pick up some 200,000 pieces of personal protective equipment (PPEs) donated to the Philippines by an Indian private company as well as pick up Filipinos stranded by the COVID-19 pandemic. They arrived in Cochin on May 6. A fire broke out in the engine room of the Ramon Alcaraz shortly after it left the port of Cochin on the evening of May 7. The fire, which lasted for 10 minutes, was quickly extinguished by naval personnel. Two enlisted men, Fireman Second Class Engineman Alvin Aldecoa and Fireman Second Class Machinery Repairman Joemari Bag-o, suffered superficial and second- degree burns respectively, and had to be airlifted to a naval hospital in Cochin for extensive medical attention. The patrol ship stayed in Cochin for an additional 21 days to assess and repair the damage to the ship's propulsion system with the help of the US Navy's Naval Sea Systems Command. ==Notable operational deployments== ===Exercises=== CARAT Philippines 2014. *The ship, together with its sister ship participated in joint naval maneuvers as part of CARAT 2014 Philippines from June 26 to July 1, 2014.
