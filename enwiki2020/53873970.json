    "text": "The West Branch Oswegatchie River is a river in Herkimer, Lewis, and St. Lawrence counties in New York. It starts at the outlet of Hog Pond and flows into the Oswegatchie River near the hamlet of Talcville. The West Branch Oswegatchie River is slower-moving than the Middle Branch, which flows into it. But the still waters such as Long Pond, Round Pond, Rock Pond, Mud Pond and Long Level are separated by hard-to-traverse rapids and/or waterfalls. == Tributaries == Right Moncrief Creek Hogs Back Creek Desert Creek Trout Lake Blue Swamp Creek Blanchard Creek Kimball Creek Middle Branch Oswegatchie River South Creek Meadow Brook Big Creek Toothaker Creek Mott Creek Bennett Brook Left Compo Creek Pine Creek Oswegatchie Creek Clear Creek Black Creek Hall Creek == References == Category:Rivers of New York (state) ",
