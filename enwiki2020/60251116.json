In the Quarterfinals, teams played a two-game series where the first team to reach 3 points was declared a winner (2 points for winning a game, 1 point each for tying). If both teams ended up with 2 points after the first two games a 20-minute mini-game used to determine a winner. Mini-game scores are in italics. Beginning with the Semifinals all games became Single-game eliminations. The winning teams in the semifinals advanced to the National Championship Game with the losers playing in a Third Place game. The teams were seeded according to geographic proximity in the quarterfinals so the visiting team would have the shortest feasible distance to travel. ==Tournament Bracket== Note: * denotes overtime period(s) Note: Mini-games in italics ==Record by conference== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Conference !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|# of Bids !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Record !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Win % !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Frozen Four !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Championship Game !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Champions |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| NCHA | 3 | 7\u20133 | | 2 | 2 | 1 |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| ECAC East | 2 | 1\u20133 | | - | - | - |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| ECAC West | 1 | 2\u20132 | | 1 | - | - |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| SUNYAC | 1 | 2\u20132 | | 1 | - | - |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| MIAC | 1 | 0\u20132 | | - | - | - |} ==References== * ==External links== *Division III Men's Ice Hockey Record Book Category:NCAA Division III ice hockey ",
