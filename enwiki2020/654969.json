    "text": "Puerto Pe\u00f1asco is a small city located in Puerto Pe\u00f1asco Municipality in the northwest of the Mexican state of Sonora, from the border with the U.S. state of Arizona. According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 62,177 inhabitants. It is located on the northern shores of the Sea of Cortez on the small strip of land that joins the Baja California Peninsula with the rest of Mexico. The area is part of the Altar Desert, one of the driest and hottest areas of the larger Sonoran Desert. Since the late 1990s, there has been a push to develop the area for tourism. It is now one of the most important tourist destinations in northern Mexico. Puerto Pe\u00f1asco is often called \"Rocky Point\" in English, and has been nicknamed \"Arizona\u2019s Beach\" as it is the closest beach to cities such as Phoenix, Tucson, and Yuma. The Mar de Cort\u00e9s International Airport serves Puerto Penasco, but currently has no regularly- scheduled flights in or out. The new highway shortens the drive from California by . Tourism and fishing are the most important economic activities for the city. Development to date includes over one hundred restaurants, forty-two hotels and motels, and fourteen RV facilities. The new \"Home Port del Mar de Cort\u00e9s\" (Sea of Cortez) cruise ship terminal is currently under construction between Sandy Beach and Cholla Bay (La Choya), northwest of the central city. ==History== The city is known by two names, Puerto Pe\u00f1asco in Spanish and Rocky Point in English. In 1826, retired Robert William Hale Hardy of the British Royal Navy was sailing in this area searching for pearls and precious metals. He named the area Rocky Point and it was identified as Rocky Point on marine maps until President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas changed it to Puerto Punta Pe\u00f1asco. To simplify pronunciation, the English name lost the word \u201cPort\u201d and the Spanish name dropped \u201cPunta\u201d. Prior to the 1920s, the area was just one of the safe harbors for wandering fisherman who worked the upper Gulf of California. During fishing seasons, fishermen from Guaymas, Bah\u00eda Kino, Puerto Libertad, and Puerto Lobos began to come here to camp out. The main attraction for these fishermen was a fish called totoaba, which was fished not for its meat, but for its use in medicine. At this time the area was known as Punta de Piedra o Punta Pe\u00f1asco. The name comes from a large quantity of solidified lava that hit the Gulf. Even as early as the 19th century, fishermen from Arizona came here. Since there was no source of drinking water, it was not settled permanently. In the 1930s, under President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, a railroad was built to connect Baja California to the rest of Mexico, passing by Puerto Pe\u00f1asco. The town began to grow again, adding a police delegation in 1932, as a dependency of the nearby municipality of Sonoyta, even though the town was part of the municipality of Caborca. The railroad line created new population centers and the initial layout of the city and port of Puerto Pe\u00f1asco was begun in the 1940s. During this same time shrimp fishing was having an impact on the local economy. In 1952, Puerto Pe\u00f1asco separated from the municipality of Caborca and comprised the localities of Sonoyta, Bah\u00eda La Choya, 21 de Marzo and Cuauht\u00e9moc. Sonoyta was the second largest population center at the time. In 1989, the municipality of Plutarco El\u00edas Calles was split from Puerto Pe\u00f1asco. Until the 1990s, there had been little tourism here except for campers and fishermen. The municipality's pristine beaches with clear waters stretched for a hundred miles north or south with almost no development. The push to make Puerto Pe\u00f1asco or Rocky Point a major tourism center was initiated in 1993, with the government joining with private investors to build condominiums and other facilities. The goal has been to take advantage of the area's proximity to the United States. Much of the inspiration for the effort came from the success of Canc\u00fan, which was a nearly virgin beach before a government/private venture developed it. Another reason to look to tourism was the declining catches of fishermen here, due to overfishing and pollution. The federal government contributed two billion pesos in infrastructure, especially roadways and an airport and the area was declared a free zone, meaning foreigners could visit the area without a visa (although a passport is still needed). There was some economic instability in 1994 and 1995, but it did not derail development here for long, coming back by 1999. Between 2002 and 2007 economic growth was at twelve percent. The local real estate market started to go bust in 2007 due to the economic slowdown in the United States. ==Cityscape== The oldest part of the town was founded between the edge of the sea and Ballena Hill. The base of the area is volcanic rock, much of it solidified lava flows from when ancient eruptions met the ocean. To promote tourism here, the city was declared to be part of the border \u201cfree zone\u201d although it is about from the U.S. This means that foreigners can drive from the U.S. to Puerto Pe\u00f1asco without obtaining visas. This makes the area attractive to visitors from Arizona, California, and Nevada. In a relatively short time, Puerto Pe\u00f1asco has become a major tourist center. It contains numerous hotels as well as RV and primitive camping sites. Many consider Puerto Pe\u00f1asco to be \u201cArizona\u2019s beach\u201d with Tucson, Phoenix, and Yuma closer than the Mexican cities of Mexicali and Hermosillo. Most visitors come for the beaches and to fish. The annual fishing festival begins on Navy Day on June 1. These celebrations feature mariachis, folklorico dance, and a festival queen. Another fishing tournament is sponsored by the La Choya Bay Club. Beaches here include Sandy Beach, Las Conchas, El Mirador, La Choya, Playa Encanto, Estero de Mor\u00faa, Playa La Joya, Playa Miramar, and Playa San Jorge. Sandy Beach is noted for its sand which is a light brown color. One attraction of the beaches is the tidal pools. Tides here can raise and lower the sea on the relatively flat land up to . Low tide reveals a large number of tidal pools in the craters of the rocky coast. In these pools there used to be large numbers of crabs, starfish, and other marine life. There is also an estuary by the name of Mor\u00faa east of the community of Las Conchas. Here live thousands of birds, including migratory species. A large number of beachfront condominiums have been built in this area including Las Conchas, Sandy Beach Resorts, Costa Diamante, Las Palomas Beach and Golf Resort, Sonoran Sea, Bella Sirena, and Las Palmas. The first condos, Las Conchas and Bah\u00edas Choya, were built in the far southeast and far northwest respectively. Interest in property here has been unexpectedly strong, prompting further developments such as Sandy Beach. This development has plans for a golf course, malls, marinas and more condos. Crafts for sale here include shell jewelry, iron pieces and carved ironwood. The airport is a joint government and private enterprise project which was inaugurated in 2008 and has a daily capacity of 2,000 passengers. Puerto Pe\u00f1asco is a popular destination for spring break, especially for high school and college students from Arizona and California for both its proximity and its 18-year-old legal drinking age. The Universidad de Sonora has its Centro de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y Tecnol\u00f3gicas (Scientific and Technological Research Center) as well as its Centro de Estudios del Desierto (Center for Desert Studies) here which are open to visitors. These institutions started as a joint project with the Laboratory of Atmospheric Sciences of the University of Arizona in 1963 to develop methods of desalinization of sea water. In 1973 and 1974, the Unidad Experimental Pe\u00f1asco was founded to research the raising of blue shrimp or Penaeus stylirostris. This project has been the leader in the development of shrimp farming techniques in Mexico. The CET-MAR Aquarium is a marine research center open to the public with displays of marine life such as turtles, octopus, and numerous fish species. Many residents are from the United States or Canada. Most restaurants offer menus in English, and most businesses accept U.S. dollars. Puerto Pe\u00f1asco is popular with retirees, especially those from the United States and Canada who have trailers and RVs. However, there are retirees here from all over the world. The town also has newspapers in English. == Geography == The city of Puerto Pe\u00f1asco (Rocky Point) is found in the northwest of the Mexican state of Sonora, a state that is located directly to the south of the U.S. state of Arizona.
