The experimental forest is located in the Sierra de Luquillo some east of San Juan, the capital of the island. It is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and is used for research into silviculture, forest regeneration, and other purposes. ==History== The Tropical Forest Research Station was founded in 1940 and became a centre for ecosystem research. It was designated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1976 with the objective of understanding \"the long-term dynamics of tropical forest ecosystems characterized by large-scale, infrequent disturbance, rapid processing of organic material, and high habitat and species diversity\". Although the experimental forest is located within the Caribbean National Forest, the two have different objectives. In a forest management plan drawn up in 1956, approximately were to be used for commercial timber production, mostly the lower, flatter part of the site. The remaining , largely mountain peaks and steep slopes, were considered non-commercial and were set aside for research and other purposes. Much of the experimental area is used for silviculture and reforestation research, but one particular area, \"Ba\u00f1o de Oro\" has been left completely unmanaged and undisturbed, for use in long term ecological studies. The experimental forest is one of 26 sites run by the Long Term Ecological Research Network, a group of international scientists studying ecological processes over long time scales. The facility was established in 1988 to study the \"long-term effects of natural and human disturbances on tropical forests and streams in the Luquillo Mountains\". The aspects studied include how hurricanes and droughts have affected the environment, and the effects of changes in agricultural practices and increased urbanization. A central database is maintained, collaboration between scientists, students and volunteers is encouraged, and efforts are made to involve the local community. ==The Luquillo Mountains== The Luquillo Mountains are about high with steep, convoluted slopes. Trade winds off the Atlantic Ocean cool as they rise over the mountains, bringing an annual rainfall of . The mountains are well-forested and are clad in mist for most of the year. The Luquillo Experimental Forest has an area of about and encompasses five different vegetation zones; montane wet forest, montane rainforest, wet forest, rainforest, and a small area of moist forest in the southwestern part. The experimental forest site is wholly inside the El Yunque National Forest, which covers a large part of the mountain range to the southwest of the city of Luquillo. Titi, Cyrilla racemiflora The composition of the forest varies according to the elevation, soil types and other factors. Compared to most mainland forests the site has a low floral biodiversity; for example, only eight species of tree account for 75% of tree density. The lower parts are dominated by the candlewood tree (Dacryodes excelsa), and the middle slopes by the titi (Cyrilla racemiflora). The upper slopes, with their perpetual cloud cover, poor light and permanently saturated soils, are clad with trees of low stature and are known as dwarf forest. The trees here include Weinmannia pinnata, Prestoea montana, Brunellia comocladifolia and Podocarpus coriaceus. ==Research== Over 2,500 research studies having been performed in the Luquillo Experimental Forest. One area of research is the resilience of the ecosystem in the face of hurricanes, landslides, and such long term changes as alterations in agricultural practices and use. A study in 2018 compared the biomass of animals collected in the forest with data from the 1970s and found a large decline, which the authors attributed to global warming, although the conclusions were disputed by a larger group of researchers working in the area, who were unable to replicate most of the findings, including the temperature change. ==References== Category:Protected areas of Puerto Rico Category:National Forests of Puerto Rico ",
