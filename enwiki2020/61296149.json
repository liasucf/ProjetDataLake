Wall, a former slave, was a service worker at the nearby Trinity College (later Duke University). He purchased a second lot, next door, on April 2, 1906. The house was completed some time in 1906 and is built in the original shotgun style with an el edition and tin roof. By 1923 the area in which Wall had settled became known as Walltown, in honor of him. The house is currently vacant and in disrepair, but is still owned by the Wall family. == References == Category:1906 establishments in North Carolina Category:African-American history in Durham, North Carolina Category:History of Durham, North Carolina Category:Houses completed in 1906 Category:Houses in Durham, North Carolina Category:Shotgun architecture ",
