Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 1999. Mary Fulkerson's primary contribution to dance, dance therapy, and guided meditation derives from the way she taught dancers and non-dancers how to use their own mental imagery to motivate expressive movement,Meekums, B., 'Spontaneous Symbolism in Clinical Supervision: Moving Beyond Logic'. Body, Movement and Dance in Psychotherapy, Vol. 2, Issue 2, 2007. which she developed upon the principles and practices previous established by Mabel Todd, Barbara Clark, Lulu Sweigard,Sweigard, L.

These teachers developed an approach to rehabilitative physical education, choreography, and improvised dance that had in common the facilitation of healthy and expressive movement through volitional use of imagination, which involved visualizing the structure and motion of the body, and allowing this kinaesthetic imagery to inform the way they moved. The term 'ideokinesis' denotes use of such imagery to rehabilitate and precipitate human movement, which Sweigard borrowed from the American piano teacher Bonpensi\u00e8re, who used imagery in his music teaching, and invented the word by combining two words derivivative of Greek: 'ideo' for idea or thought, and 'kinesis' for movement.Bernard, A.,. 'An Introduction to Ideokinesis'. Contact Quarterly Vol. 22 Issue 2, 1997, 23-5.Overby, L. Y. and Dunn, J., 'The History and Research Of Dance Imagery: Implications For Teachers'. The IADMS Bulletin for Teachers, Volume 3, Issue 2, 2011, pp9-11.Williams, D., Teaching Dancing with Ideokinetic Principles. University of Illinois Press, 2011. Fulkerson initiated two developments in the work established by her predecessors. Firstly, she extended the type of imagery used by her students and dancers in both choreographed and improvised dance beyond the anatomical and kinesthetic. This enabled her students and dancers to physicalize and embody a range of images, including entities, animals, and characters. Secondly, she prepared her dancers and students for practice, rehearsal, and performance using a technique comparable to guided meditation, guided imagery, and creative visualization, verbally suggesting images as the members of her ensemble or class lay still, becoming increasingly aware of their body prior to initiating movement. As a consequence, Fulkerson's approach to dance education has been described as a form of movement meditation.Mock, R., Performing Processes.

The school continued to operate until it was made part of ArtEZ Dansacademie Arnhem, and fully merged with the former in 2002. Graduate students of this school are among others Peter Pleyer, Eszter G\u00e1l, Karen Schaffman, Tebby W. Ramasike, and many others. == Links == Living Legacy Project http://the-live-legacy-project.com/guests/mary-odonnell/ Article discussing her work at Dartington College https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19443927.2018.1482230 ==References== Category:Living people Category:Creative arts therapies Category:Dance teachers Category:American female dancers Category:American dancers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:American women choreographers Category:American choreographers ",
