    "text": "The Manhattan Transfer Live was recorded by The Manhattan Transfer live at Manchester on April 23, 1978; Bristol on April 28, 1978; and the Hammersmith Odeon Theatre, London, on May 2, 1978. The album was produced by Tim Hauser and Janis Siegel. This was the final album made with Laurel Mass\u00e9 (due to a car accident in early 1979). For many years this album had the distinction of being the only Manhattan Transfer album not to be released on LP, CD or cassette tape in the U.S. A short-lived Japanese CD was released on October 10, 1987. It was finally issued on CD in the U.S. by Wounded Bird Records in 2005. In the live performances there was a \"15 minute Intermission\" at the end of side one, between \"Speak Up Mambo (Cuentame)\" (CD track 8) and \"In the Dark\" (CD track 9). ==Background== The album was not originally published in the United States, under the catalogue number SD 19218, belonging to the series of Atlantic Records for the U.S. original publications, was used for some local editions, as in Sweden and in Australia. In the U.S. the album was published as an LP in 1979 by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab in a collector's edition under the name \"Original Master Recording\" (discs made from the master original) For many years, ending in 2005, The Manhattan Transfer Live was the only album of the group that was not reissued in the U.S. on CD. Warner- Pioneer in Japan released a CD version in 1987. The cover of the standard editions of Atlantic Records was described by Janis Siegel as \"the worst cover in history (perhaps only after Mecca for Moderns and Coming Out, is a drawing in a cartoon style of the four members of the group, and was reused for the re-release on CD of the Wounded Bird Records of June 21, 2005, while that of the edition Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab is a photograph depicting the silhouette of the group at twilight (photography included in the inner envelope of the Atlantic version). ==Track listing== # \"That Cat Is High\" - (J.M.
