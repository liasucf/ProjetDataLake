    "text": "Ugress is an electronica project from Bergen, Norway, the main project of electronic musician Gisle Martens Meyer (GMM). Gisle started his music career in the early 1990s making Scream Tracker and Fast Tracker modules under the alias Gnosis. Among Meyer's other projects are Nebular Spool, Shadow of the Beat and Ninja9000 as well as scoring soundtracks for moving pictures and several TV-shows. Ugress has released multiple albums, singles, and EPs to date. Their first five albums: Resound, released in 2002, climbed to the second place on the official Norwegian chart board. A second album, Cinematronics, was released two years later. It reached the third place on the same list. A third Ugress album titled Unicorn was released on January 28, 2008. On June 15, 2009, Ugress released their fourth studio album, called Reminiscience. Collectronics, a compilation album including previously unreleased material, was released in July 2010. Ugress is notable for providing free mp3-versions of many of its songs through its web page and the web pages of associated acts like Nebular Spool. The Norwegian word ugress means \"weeds\" (not as in cannabis). ==Style== Ugress uses a lot of sample snippets from various artists, movies (in particular horror and science fiction movies) and TV shows. Ugress is not the only project of Gisle Martens Meyer, it is actually one of several different projects by Uncanny Planet Records. ==Discography== ===Albums=== * Resound (2002) * La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc (2003) * Cinematronics (2004) * Cowboy Desperado (2005) * Film Music (2006) * Unicorn (2008) * Reminiscience (2009) * Collectronics (2010) * Pushwagner (2011) * Aelita \u2013 Queen Of Mars (2013) * H\u00e4xan (2016) * It Came From Beyond Eternal September (2016) * The Wrong Future (2018) * Black Anorak (2018) * Ghoststorm (2019) ===Singles and EPs=== * E-Pipe (2000) * Ugress Promo (2001) * Loungemeister (2002) * Sophisticated Wickedness (2006) * Retroconnaissance (2006) * Kosmonaut (2006) * Chromosome Corrupt (2007) * Loungemeister (2008) * Schizophonica (2009) * Reminiscience (2009) * Loungemeister (2010) \u2014 Re-issue of the 2002 limited edition 12\" with a slightly different tracklist. * Planet U: Episode One - Planetfall (2011) * Planet U: Episode Two - The Lost Ruins (2011) * Planet U: Episode Three - Wulfh\u00f6ken Spaceport Affairs (2011) * Planet U: Episode Four - Luftslott (2011) * Planet U: Episode Five - Time Machine (2012) * Planet U: Episode Six - Another Planet (2013) * Phantom Of The Wuxia Codec (2019) ===Miscellaneous=== * The B Vault (2008) \u2014 Compilation of unreleased tracks 2000-2007 ==References== ==External links== * Uncanny planet - Homepage of Uncanny Records, \"motherpage\" of the projects * Journals of GMM - Blog, where updates on all projects and other issues are posted * Gislewiki - a fan-run wiki about Gisle Sub-projects: * Ugress' Official Website - free MP3s and music video downloads * Shadow Of The Beat - free MP3s * Spokelseskladden - free MP3s * Nebular Spool - free MP3s * PixxelTyger - free MP3s * Ninja9000 - free MP3s Category:Norwegian electronic music groups Category:Norwegian hip hop groups Category:Trip hop groups Category:Big beat groups Category:Musical groups established in 2000 Category:2000 establishments in Norway Category:Musical groups from Bergen Category:Demosceners Category:Tracker musicians Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
