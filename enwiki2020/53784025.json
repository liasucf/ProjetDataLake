Vishweshwar and editing by Gautham Raju. The film released on 26 May 2017. ==Plot== The story begins in a village as a tale of three best friends: Krishna (Jagapathi Babu), Adinarayana (Sampath Raj), and Prabhakar (Irshad). Adi has a huge family, and one day, his elder sister Priya (Priya) gets engaged. Ten days before her wedding, she elopes, leaving behind a letter that she has loved another man and has gone to live with him. Due to some misunderstanding, Krishna is suspected, and the friendship turns into enmity. The story moves forward 25 years, with Bhrahmaramba (Rakul Preet Singh), the innocent and heavily pampered only daughter of Adi, who has little to no exposure to the outside world. She dreams of marrying a man who has the qualities of a prince, as said by her grandmother. Shiva (Naga Chaitanya), the son of Krishna, meets Bhrahmaramba in his brother Kishore's (Vennela Kishore) marriage with Bhramarambha's friend and falls in love with her at first sight. After playful encounters, they separate ways. Bhramarambha eventually comes to Vizag, Shiva's hometown, for her studies. She quickly finds out that Shiva lives in Vizag, and they spend a lot of time together, with her sharing everything with him. She tells him that she is not interested in a relationship with him. Shiva loves her, but in fear of rejection, does not reveal his love. Later they get into an argument, with Shiva revealing his love for her and being frustrated on her not having a clarity on her life and that she keeps waiting for a prince and does not realize what she has. Bhramarambha furiously returns home and accepts a marriage proposal by her cousin out of anger. The rest of the story is how Shiva finally makes Brahmaramba realize him as her prince and resolves disputes between both families. ==Cast== * Naga Chaitanya as Shiva * Rakul Preet Singh as Bhramaramba * Jagapathi Babu as Krishna * Sampath Raj as Adinarayana * Irshad as Prabhakar * Vennela Kishore as Kishore * Kousalya as Geetha, Adi's wife * Annapurna as Lakshmi, Adi's mother * Chalapathi Rao as Suryanarayana, Adi's father * Priya as Priya * Anitha Chowdary as Shiva's sister * Pruthviraj as Dorababu * Banerjee as Banerjee * Surekha Vani as Surekha * Posani Krishna Murali as Rambabu * Raghu Babu as Bhaskar * Saptagiri as Bangaram * Madhunandan as Ravi * Satya Krishnan * Thagubothu Ramesh as Govind * Duvvasi Mohan * Hyper Aadi * Chitti * Prabhu * Rajitha * Avantika Vandanapu as young Bhramarambha ==Soundtrack== The music was composed by Devi Sri Prasad and was released on Aditya Music Company.

The trick lies in making you yearn for the feeling of being together, despite all odds. It\u2019s the theme of most family dramas in Telugu films and Rarandoi Veduka Choodham is no different\". IndiaGlitz gave 3 out of 5 stars stating \"A wafer-thin and predictable story, 'RVC' comes with an excellent characterization of the heroine, and largely fine performances. Proper spacing of songs was needed. All said, there are elements that could appeal to family audiences\". The Times of India gave 2.5 out of 5 stars stating \"Rarandoi Veduka Chudham uses the age-old run-of-the-mill set-up to establish the story and its characters. As far as the plot is concerned, there is nothing new that one can expect from the family drama - fathers pampering their children, children falling in love with the enemy\u2019s son and the clich\u00e9s. Finally, when things are set to take an offbeat turn, a simple clarification of a misunderstanding brings the plot to a happy ending; bummer!\". == Awards and nominations == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Date of ceremony !Award !Category !Recipient(s) and nominee(s) !Result !Ref. |- | rowspan=\"2\"|17 December 2017 | rowspan=\"2\"|Zee Telugu Golden Awards | Favorite Film of the Year | Rarandoi Veduka Chudham | | rowspan=\"2\"| |- | Entertainer Of The Year | Naga Chaitanya | |- | 16 June 2018 | Filmfare Awards South | Best Actress \u2013 Telugu | Rakul Preet Singh | | |- | 14 &15 September 2018 | South Indian International Movie Awards | Best Lyricist \u2013 Telugu | Sri Mani | | |- | 17 February 2019 | TSR \u2013 TV9 National Film Awards | Best Actress Award | Rakul Preet Singh | | |- |} ==References== Category:2017 films Category:Indian films Category:Indian romantic comedy films Category:Films scored by Devi Sri Prasad Category:2010s Telugu-language films Category:Telugu films remade in other languages Category:2017 romantic comedy films ",
