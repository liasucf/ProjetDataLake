Because of the small size it is commonly dried. Usipa is mostly eaten in Malawi and Mozambique along with nsima ugali. Dried usipa is sold at most markets in Malawi. In Malawi, Usipa is typically consumed with the bones in it due to their softness. Usipa plays a significant role in the economic livelihood for many households at Lake Malawi that rely upon fishing for income. A great deal is not known about the species' biology. ==References== Category:Malawian_cuisine Category:Mozambican cuisine Category:Yao (East Africa) Category:Fish common names Category:Engraulicypris ",
