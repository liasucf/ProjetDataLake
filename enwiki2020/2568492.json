Unlike other honors colleges, the WHC is an immersive experience, with students taking all or nearly all of their coursework (120+ hours) within the WHC, and few if any classes from other colleges within the University.https://publicuniversityhonors.com/2018/04/18/florida-atlantic- univ-wilkes-honors-college-is-full-on-honors/ The Honors College shares the Jupiter Campus with the Scripps Research Institute and the Max Planck Florida Institute, where many Wilkes Honors College students have been accepted to participate in internships.https://www.fau.edu/honors/undergraduate- research/stem ==Academics== The Wilkes Honors College offers a full complement of degree-fulfilling courses taught by its own faculty. The college emphasizes small class size, with a faculty-student ratio of approximately 1:15. Its core curriculum, which makes up about a third of credit requirements for the B.A., focuses on critical thinking and writing skills in a broad range of disciplines. One distinguishing feature of the curriculum is that students are required to take at least three separate classes which are team-taught by faculty in different disciplines. http://www.fau.edu/academic/registrar/FAUcatalog/honors.php. An additional graduation requirement is that students complete either an internship or a study abroad and, as noted below, an honors thesis. ===Scholarships=== Scholarships are abundant for students attending Harriet L.
