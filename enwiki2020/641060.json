    "text": "H\u00e1ba in 1957 Alois H\u00e1ba (21 June 1893 \u2013 18 November 1973) was a Czech composer, music theorist and teacher. He belongs to the important discoverers in modern classical music, and major composers of microtonal music, especially using the quarter-tone scale, though he used others such as sixth-tones (e.g., in the 5th, 10th and 11th String Quartets), fifth-tones (Sixteenth String Quartet), and twelfth-tones. From the other mictrotonal conceptions, he discussed a \"three-quarter tone\" system (see three-quarter tone flat and the neutral second) in his theoretical worksMyles Lee Skinner, \"Toward a Quarter- Tone Syntax: Analyses of Selected Works by Blackwood, Haba, Ives and Wyschnegradsky\", PhD diss. (Buffalo: State University of New York at Buffalo, 2006; Ann Arbor: ProQuest/UMI, 2007), p. 15 .Patricia Strange and Allen Strange, The Contemporary Violin: Extended Performance Techniques (Berkeley, Los Angeles & London: University of California Press, 2001), p. 165. but he used scales in this tuning in sections of some of his compositions. In his prolific career, H\u00e1ba composed three operas, an enormous collection of chamber music including 16 string quartets, piano, organ and choral pieces, some orchestral works and songs.Lubom\u00edr Spurn\u00fd and Ji\u0159\u00ed Vyslou\u017eil, Alois H\u00e1ba: A Catalogue of the Music and Writings, trans. Paul Victor Christiansen (Prague: Koniasch Latin Press, 2010). He also had special keyboard and woodwind instruments constructed that were capable of playing quarter-tone scales.David Ewen, The World of Twentieth-Century Music (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1968). == Life == Alois H\u00e1ba was born in the small town of Vizovice in Moravian Wallachia, into a family of 10 children. When he was five years old it was discovered that he had absolute pitch. He and his family often played and sang their native Wallachian folk songs, actively participated in church singing and folk-music performances. In school, Alois became very interested in the musical aspects of the Czech language, above all in pitch, rhythm, accent, dynamics, and timbre of the speech. In 1908 he entered the teacher's training college in Krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e, where he began to develop an interest in Czech national music, analyzing the works of Bed\u0159ich Smetana. Already at that time he found out from his textbooks that the European system of music was not the only one in the world and that even some European music had in the past used different scales than the ones used in his time. He therefore started to develop his own point of view in this issue. After finishing his studies, he got a job as teacher in B\u00edlovice, a small town near the Hungarian (now Slovak) border. Simultaneously, he continued his own musical studies and in 1913 wrote his first compositions, displaying an unwillingness to \"follow the rules\", which he maintained all his life. H\u00e1ba was dissatisfied by small-town life, and in 1914, he moved to Prague and became a pupil of neoromantic composer V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nov\u00e1k. Here he was interested in analysing the works of Claude Debussy, Max Reger, Alexander Scriabin, and Richard Strauss, and in harmonization of Moravian folk music. === Vienna === During World War I, he served in the Austrian Army on the Russian and Italian front from 1915 until early 1918, when he was moved to Vienna, where he worked in the music department of the Austrian-Hungarian Ministry of War. There he almost immediately became a student of Franz Schreker, who brought out his more radical tendencies. At that time, H\u00e1ba wrote his first quarter-tone piece, Suite, consisting of three fugues in the quarter-tone system, composed for two pianos tuned a quarter tone apart. Remaining in Vienna after the war, H\u00e1ba attended the concerts produced by Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg's Verein f\u00fcr musikalische Privatauff\u00fchrungen, and became particularly influenced by the \"athematic\" style used by Sch\u00f6nberg in his Erwartung. First publications of his compositions included the String Quartet No. 2, his first major quarter-tone work which was composed in 1920. At that time, his lifelong friendship with Hanns Eisler \u2013 with whom he shared political beliefs (H\u00e1ba became an ardent communist at this time) as well as musical opinions \u2013 began. === Berlin === H\u00e1ba found his first success as a composer in Berlin, where he followed his teacher Schreker in late 1920. He published his first theoretical treatise (in Czech), the small booklet Harmonick\u00e9 z\u00e1klady \u010dtvrtt\u00f3nov\u00e9 soustavy (Harmonic Essentials of the Quarter-tone System). In 1923, he met Ferrucio Busoni, who had advocated the sixth-tone system and encouraged H\u00e1ba to continue his work in microtonality. The same year, H\u00e1ba began to attempt the establishment of a school of microtonal music, but as the Nazis started to gain power in Germany, he came under attack and was driven out of Berlin. He returned to Prague and managed to get a job teaching workshops at the Prague Conservatory. === Prague === In July 1923 at the festival of modern music in Donaueschingen, the Amar- Hindemith Quartet played H\u00e1ba\u2019s quarter-tone String Quartet No. 3\\. His name began to appear alongside other representatives of his generation\u2019s avant- garde musicians and, thanks to him, Czechoslovakia became one of the first member countries of the International Society for Contemporary Music. H\u00e1ba wrote several theoretical articles on microtonality, athematicism, and church modes at this time. In 1925 he wrote his major theoretical work New Harmony- Textbook of the Diatonic, Chromatic, Quarter-, Third-, Sixth-, and Twelfth- tone Systems (if necessary, see: diatonic, chromatic). He designed and had built two quarter-tone pianos by early 1924 and a third in 1925. In 1927, the Czech branch factory of the German piano firm August F\u00f6rster in the North Bohemian town of Ji\u0159\u00edkov built for him a sixth-tone harmonium, patterned mostly after the design by Busoni. After the premiere of his quarter-tone opera Matka (Mother) in 1931, introducing a practically athematic concept, H\u00e1ba emerged as a leader of Czech modernist music and became internationally well known as one of the most important avantgarde composers. This opera also uses two quarter-tone clarinets and two quarter-tone trumpets, which were built especially for this work. In 1934, he composed the opera Nov\u00e1 zem\u011b (The New Earth) in the twelve-tone system. Athematic constructions characteristic of his work appeared also later in the opera P\u0159ij\u010f kr\u00e1lovstv\u00ed tv\u00e9 (Thy Kingdom Come) (1940), which is written in the sixth-tone system.Editors of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, \"Alois H\u00e1ba: Czech Composer\", Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online (accessed 12 September 2016). In all three operas, H\u00e1ba expressed his bold socialist viewpoint, that caused controversies already at the time. For instance, the production of Nov\u00e1 Zem\u011b (the plot of which deals with the Holodomor in Ukraine and how the Holodomor in a Ukrainian village is defeated by socialisation of production and founding the kolkhoz Nov\u00e1 Zem\u011b (The New Earth) by National Theatre in Prague in 1936 had to be cancelled by intervention from the Ministry of Culture as communist and pro-soviet propaganda. In 1933, when Josef Suk became director of the Prague Conservatory, H\u00e1ba was made a full professor and established the Department of Quarter-tone and Sixth-tone Music. Here he had much influence over his many students. It was also the early 1930s that saw the writing of what is probably H\u00e1ba\u2019s most important orchestral work, the symphonic fantasy Cesta \u017eivota (The Path of Life). The 1930s also shaped H\u00e1ba\u2019s political stance and philosophy of life. His strong sense of social commitment found an intellectual basis in the anthroposophical teachings of Rudolf Steiner. In 1939 the German Nazis occupied Czechoslovakia and banned performance of H\u00e1ba's work. They closed down the Prague Conservatory in 1941 and prevented him from teaching. During the war H\u00e1ba wrote a continuation of his Theory of Harmony, completed, as already mentioned, a sixth-tone opera (which was never produced), and considered constructing a twelfth-tone harmonium. After World War II, he resumed teaching and held several administrative positions. At the turn of forties and fifties, the work of Alois H\u00e1ba was affected by the communist regime in Czechoslovakia, becoming transitionally simplified, much more \"thematic\" and tonal, and also setting texts projecting communist ideology. He was nevertheless unable to rid himself of the label of \u201cformalist\u201d stuck onto him by Marxist aesthetics. In 1953 he was sent into retirement, but in his own words it was only at that point that he achieved real creative freedom. In 1957 he was named an honorary member of the ISCM. When H\u00e1ba returned to his style, he continued in his experimental musical studies, which culminated in the 1960s with the use of fifth tones in his Sixteenth String Quartet in 1967. This work was premiered in the same year at the ISCM festival in Prague, performing by Nov\u00e1k Quartet. H\u00e1ba was a prolific composer and continued to compose almost to the end of his life. He taught and influenced many musicians. Besides followers in his own country, H\u00e1ba attracted students from southern Slavic countries (Slovenia, Serbia, Bulgaria), Lithuania, Turkey, and elsewhere. The Prague Conservatory in general enjoyed an international reputation, and a great deal of credit for that goes to the contacts and pioneering efforts of Alois H\u00e1ba. Despite these facts, he died in relative obscurity in Prague in 1973. == Concept == == Works == Alois H\u00e1ba's works total 103 opuses, the majority of which are various kinds of chamber music. Among the most important are his string quartets, which document and demonstrate the development of his style. In addition to quarter tones, H\u00e1ba used sixth-tones in his String Quartets nos. in the 5, 10, and 11, as well as in Six Pieces for Sixth-tone Harmonium or String Quartet (1928), Duo for Sixth-tone Violins (1937), Thy Kingdom Come, a Sixth-tone Musical Drama in Seven Scenes (1937\u201342), Suite in Sixth-tones for Solo Violin (1955), and Suite in Sixth-tones for Solo Cello (1955).
