It lies west of Prague, outside the main road towards Karlovy Vary. L\u00e1ny is well known for the L\u00e1ny Castle. ==Etymology== The word \"L\u00e1ny\" in Czech means \"fields\" or \"tracts (of land)\". ==History== Until 1918, the village was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), in the Schlan (Slan\u00fd) district, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften (district office) in Bohemia. A post-office was opened in 1869.Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den \u00f6sterreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm Klein, 1967 The second oldest horse-drawn iron wagonway in continental Europe operated between Prague and L\u00e1ny (originally planned to reach Plze\u0148) from 1830 until 1869. Its final station was in present-day forester's lodge of P\u00edn\u011b. ==Sights== Its major landmark is a castle, serving as a summer residence of Czechoslovak and later Czech Presidents. There is also a sports car museum and Museum of T. G. Masaryk, the first President of Czechoslovakia. Both President Masaryk and his wife are buried in the local cemetery. ===L\u00e1ny Castle=== The castle of L\u00e1ny was first mentioned in 1392. It changed owners many times and underwent a major reconstruction in 1902\u20131903. In 1921, it was purchased by the Czechoslovak state and designated as an official summer presidential residence. Slovene architect Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik was commissioned to make improvements both to the castle and the adjacent park. T. G. Masaryk, the first President, liked the castle and was allowed to stay there after his abdication in 1935 until his death in 1937. From 1921 served as his favourable summer residence.Vratislav Precl\u00edk: MDH uctilo pam\u00e1tku Prezidenta Osvoboditele, in \u010cas: \u010dasopis Masarykova demokratick\u00e9ho hnut\u00ed, \u010dervenec \u2013 z\u00e1\u0159\u00ed 2015, ro\u010d. XXIII. \u010d\u00eds. 111. ISSN 1210-1648, str. 16 - 17 During World War II, the castle was a residence of Emil H\u00e1cha, an increasingly ill and incapacitated President of Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia. The castle was used only rarely during the Communist era. Many valuable artefacts, especially those designed by Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik, were discarded during the tenure of Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k. Only after the Velvet Revolution did the new President V\u00e1clav Havel start to come to the castle regularly. Since then, it has been a place of many official sessions between the President and other top politicians. The castle itself is closed to the public. The castle park is accessible on selected days, including weekends and public holidays. ==Transport== The closest train station is Stochov (formerly L\u00e1ny) about away, still preserving Masaryk's salon used by the President before boarding a train. ==Gallery== File:Lany- konirna.jpg|Horse stable File:Lany-zamek-vstup.jpg|Castle entry File:Lany- zamek-kostel1.jpg|Church File:Hrob TGM v L\u00e1nech - 1.jpg|Grave of the Masaryk family File:Tatra MTX front.JPG|MTX Tatra V8 in Sports car museum ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Official site of L\u00e1ny Castle Category:Villages in Kladno District ",
