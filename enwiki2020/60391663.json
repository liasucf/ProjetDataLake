    "text": "Pochytoides is a genus of Guinean jumping spiders. ==Taxonomy== The group was first described by Berland and Millot in 1941 as a subgenus of the genus Pochyta. It was elevated to a full genus by Wanda Weso\u0142owska in 2018. However, neither name was valid as no type species had been given. Weso\u0142owska corrected this in 2020, designating Pochyta poissoni. Like Pochyta, Pochytoides is placed in the tribe Aelurillini in the Salticoida clade of the subfamily Salticinae. ===Species=== the genus contained eight species. All species are known only from Guinea: *Pochytoides lamottei Weso\u0142owska, 2018 *Pochytoides monticola Weso\u0142owska, 2018 *Pochytoides obstipa Weso\u0142owska, 2018 *Pochytoides patellaris Weso\u0142owska, 2018 *Pochytoides perezi (Berland & Millot, 1941) *Pochytoides poissoni (Berland & Millot, 1941) *Pochytoides securis Weso\u0142owska, 2018 *Pochytoides spiniger Weso\u0142owska, 2018 ==References== Category:Salticidae Category:Salticidae genera ",
