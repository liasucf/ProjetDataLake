    "text": "Swashbuckle is a television show on CBeebies. Aimed at young children aged 2\u20137, it takes the form of a game show putting children against a band of \"naughty pirates\". ==Format== The show takes place on the site of the shipwreck of the Scarlet Squid, in which three \"naughty pirates\" \u2212 Captain Sinker/Captain Captain/Captain HeyHo and her hapless shipmates Cook and Line \u2013 have stolen and hidden Gem's five jewels. Four children challenge in a series of games to try to win back the jewels, under the watchful eye of the ship's parrot Squawk. After two games, either 5, 4 or 3 jewels are hunted against the clock as the children try to find them hidden within the shipwreck. If the children successfully retrieve all of the jewels then a wheel with three sections (four in series 5-6) is spun to determine which of the three pirates (or all of them, in series 5-6) must walk the plank into the gunge-filled Ship's Mess. If the arrow lands in the middle then the swashbucklers must send both naughty pirates in. Every time the swashbucklers win a game, one of Gem's jewels are sent down. If the Swashbucklers lose the second game, Gem will receive a different item from Captain Sinker/Captain Captain/Captain HeyHo, usually an old worthless item. From series 6 onwards, if the swashbucklers fail in all three challenges, they also retrieve a fake jewel from Cook and Line as a consolation prize. ==Cast== ===Main=== *Gem \u2013 Gemma Hunt *Cook \u2013 Joseph Elliott *Line \u2013 Richard David-Caine *Squawk \u2013 Conor McNamara (series 1 onwards) *Captain Sinker \u2013 Ella Kenion (series 1\u20133, she however makes an appearance in series 4 on episodes Sinker's Holiday and Sinker's Return.) *Captain Captain \u2013 Jennie Dale (series 4\u20135, she however makes an appearance in series 4 and 5 on episodes The New Captain to No Longer Naughty Pirates.) *Captain HeyHo - Sophia Nomvete (series 6) ===Special guests=== Sometimes on Swashbuckle, guests appear on the show.
