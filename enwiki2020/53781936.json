Campbell died on August 8, 2017, two months later. ==Background and recording== After being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, Campbell embarked on a 2011\u20132012 Farewell Tour. After finishing the tour, he entered the studio in Nashville to record a final album. According to his wife, Kim Campbell, he wanted to preserve \"what magic was left,\" in what would be his final recordings. Featuring eleven songs Campbell had long loved but never recorded, the album was made with the help of producer and longtime collaborator Carl Jackson. Singers Willie Nelson, Vince Gill and Campbell's children Ashley, Shannon and Cal also make guest appearances. According to Carl Jackson, he had to stand with Campbell in the recording booth to record the vocals \"line by line\" as Campbell could not remember the lyrics. However, Jackson noted that Campbell \"didn't lose his melodies, and that beautiful perfect pitch and tone\". ==Release== The album was released on June 9, 2017. The first track, a remake of the Fred Neil classic \"Everybody's Talkin'\", was released on YouTube and to the media on April 14, 2017. The title track was made available for streaming on May 3, 2017. ==Single== The only single from the album is the title track, which was released on July 25, 2017, two weeks before his death. ==Commercial performance== The album debuted at No. 40 on Billboard 200 with 14,000 units, nearly all of which are from traditional album sales. This is Campbell's 16th top 40 album on the chart. It also debuted at No. 7 on Top Country Albums, his 19th top 10 album on this chart. The album has sold 72,800 copies in the US as of January 2018. In the United Kingdom, Adi\u00f3s debuted at number three on the UK Albums Chart on 16 June 2017, becoming Campbell's highest debut ever in Britain.
