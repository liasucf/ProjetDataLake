On 5 September the Royal Navy renamed her Gertrude, but the change of name was not widely known. The report of her sinking in Lloyd's List in January 1805 still referred to her as Flying Fish.Lloyd's List \u21164182. Gertrude, Lieutenant George Broad, commander, had been ordered to join the blockade squadron off Ushant, France. As the two vessels maneuvered close to each other Aigle ran over Gertrude, rolling her over and sending her masts overboard. Aigle passed over Gertrude. Aigle was able, with difficulty, to save Gertrudes crew. ==Citations and references== Citations References * * Category:Hired armed vessels of the Royal Navy Category:Maritime incidents in 1804 Category:Ships sunk in collisions Category:Shipwrecks in the English Channel ",
