    "text": "Stanislas Idzikowski (1894 \u2013 12 February 1977) was a Polish dancer and ballet master, active in England, and with such historic companies as Pavlova's, Ballets Russes, and Vic-Wells. During his performance career, 1910-1933, he became famous for his brilliant classical technique, and for the development of ballet roles. With Beaumont he co-authored an influential book on the Cecchetti Method, still in print. He later taught dance in London. ==His start in ballet: Warsaw to London== Born in Warsaw Stanis\u0142aw Idzikowski at the age of ten began his formal dance training, at the ballet school of the Wielki Theatre in his native city.Beaumont (1926), p.1. Inspired seeing a Tchaikovsky ballet, he sought ballet school. His father was a sculpture. Among his early instructors was the Italian dancer and teacher Enrico Cecchetti, who would later prove important for his professional life.Koegler (1977). p.269 (Idzikowski: Teatr Wielki, Cecchetti), p.110 (Cecchetti: moves to Teatr Wielki in 1902).\"Enrico Cecchetti\" at Cecchetti website: at Teatro Wielki 1902-1905. He also studied with Stanislav Gilbert and Anatole Vilzak.\"Stanislas Idzidkowski\" at Cecchetti website: teachers. Auguste Berger a Bohemian then instructed him which led to his stage debut in Ali Baba, a ballet divertissement.Related perhaps to the op\u00e9ra bouffe Ali Baba by Charles Lecocq. When Idzikowski was sixteen, he relocated to England, and Anglicized his given name Stanis\u0142aw to Stanislas. His performing career in London's West End then began, doing musical and ballet productions, e.g., The Belle of New York in 1911. He danced in the touring company of Russian ballet star Anna Pavlova in 1912. He traveled to Lausanne in 1914 where he met the impresario Sergei Diaghilev. Cecchetti then recommended him for the Ballets Russes; he soon became a leading dancer.Beaumont (1926), pp. 1-2: Berger, debut, London, Belle, Pavlova, Diaghilev, Cecchetti. The company then left to tour America.Oxford Reference: Cecchetti, London's Empire Theatre 1911, Pavlova 1912, Kosloff 1913, Ballets Russes 1914.Garafola (1998), Wielki, Cecchetti, Anglicized name, West End, Ballets Russes.\"Stanislas Idzikowski\" at Cecchetti website: re Pavlova, Ballets Russes. ==In Diaghilev's Ballets Russes== Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, Russian stamp. Idzikowski danced here, 1914-1924, 1925-1929.Oxford Reference: years at Ballets Russes.Contra: Koegler (1977), p.269 (at BR: 1914-1926, 1928-1929). Diaghilev 1872-1929. A small, muscular man, Idzikowski had developed a strong classical ballet technique and was capable of performing virtuosic feats.Beaumont (1926), pp. 2, 4 (technique). With the Diaghilev company, he first assumed roles made famous by Vaslav Nijinsky,Oxford Reference: \"Though unusually short he was a dazzling virtuoso with an extraordinary jump, and took over many of Nijinski's roes... .\"Garafola (2005): L\u00e9onide Massine was also a \"a replacement for Nijinsky\" (p.60). Massine the dancer \"took over Nijinsky's roles in Petrouchka, Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tra, Sch\u00e9h\u00e9razade, and L'Apr\u00e8s-midi d'un Faune\" (p. 185). its former star performer and a world celebrity.Moore (2014), p.5: \"Vaslav Nijinsky, possibly the greatest genius of twentieth century dance\".Cf. Nijinska (1981), pp. 472-487: Nijinsky's departure from Ballets Russes in 1913. Thus, in choreographer Michel Fokine's ballets Idzikowski danced: the role of Harlequin in Le Carnaval; in Petrushka, the title role; and in Le Spectre de la Rose, the Spirit.Beaumont (1926), p.2: Idzikowski's first roles at Ballets Russes: Carnaval, Petrushka, Rose.Stanislas Idzikowski at Cecchetti website: his roles.Balanchine (1954), per Nijinsky's roles in Le Carnaval p.79, Petrouchka p.268, Le Spectre de la Rose p.356. Yet their interpretive approach could differ. As Harlequin, Nijinsky expressed a \"spirit of subtle mockery and cynical worldly wisdom\". While Idzikowski, according to Beaumont, danced the part with a \"mischievous certainty, but always good natured\".Beaumont (1926), p.3 (quotes per Harlequin in Le Carnaval). > These roles \"previously seemed the particular property of that great genius > Nijinsky. Few things are more unnerving to a dancer than to execute a dance > which the public is accustomed to see performed by someone else.\"Beaumont > (1926), p.2 (quote per Nijinsky).David Adams: At first many saw Idzikowski > as \"the understudy to Nijinsky, but [he] was as good, in every way, as the > great man himself.\" Idzikowshi was particularly celebrated for his phenomenal elevation and dazzling batterie.Beaumont (1926), pp. 2, 4, 5: classical ballet technique.Oxford Reference: technique.Grant (1950, 1982), elevation p.45 (\"the height attained in springing steps [jumps]\"), batterie pp. 22-23 (\"legs beat together, or one leg beats against the other\"), beats p.23 (\"during a jump by striking the calves sharply together\"). As before him Cecchetti in 1890, and Nijinsky in 1907, Idzikowski in 1921 performed as the Blue Bird in the pas de deux from The Sleeping Beauty of Tchaikovsky.Balanchine (1954), pp. 336-354: The Sleeping Beaty; at p.353: Nijinsky in 1911 in the pas de deus [as the Blue Bird]; at 336, 475: Idzikowski as Blue Bird in London 1921; at 348: the Blue Bird role.Nijinska (1982), pp. 207-210: Nijinsky as Blue Bird in 1907 at Maryinsky Theatre, Sankt-Peterberg; Cecchetti as Blue Bird in 1890.Beaumont (1926), p.4: Idzikowski and La Belle au Bois Dormant, p. 3: La Princesse Echant\u00e9e.Garafola (1989), pp. 342-344, at 343 (Lydia Lopokova and Idzikowski in The Sleeping Princess), cf. pp. 408-409.Greskovic (2000), p.71, the 1890 choreography for Cecchetti's Blue Bird was likely devised by the dancer- teacher himself.\" Cf. 291-292, 425. \"[His] most famous role was the Blue Bird in The Sleeping Princess of 1921\" premiering in London.Koegler (1977), quote. Possessed of a strong sense of comedy and drama, he also became known for the character roles he created in the ballets of L\u00e9onide Massine, including the role of the Cat in Kikimora (1916), Battista in Les Femmes de Bonne Humeur (1917), the Spark (Dandy) in Le Tricorne (1919), the Snob in La Boutique Fantasque (1919),Massine (1968), pp. 135-136. The choreographer Massine provides this description of a scene from the ballet La Boutique Fantasque where toys come to life. Idzi played the 'snob': > \"When he was given a slice of melon, Idzikowski, in a brilliant extempore > piece of miming, ate it as if playing on a mouth-organ. To shatter his > conceit I made the melon-seller knock him over with the barrow, but > springing into the air, he came to rest with a bow and one hand raised to > twirl his mustache.\" Balanchine (1954), p.58, describes the same scene in another version: a melon hawker slices a piece for the snob who soon \"trips over the hawker, only to rise again in a mechanical miracle.\" and Corviello in Pulcinella (1920).Beaumont (1926), pp. 3-5 (the five ballet roles).Garafola (1989), pp. 406-408 (the five ballets, plus The Sleeping Princess). Kikimora in 1917 incorporated into Contes Russes (p.406) aka Children's Tales (p.336).Oxford Reference (the five ballets). Among his other original roles was the Cock on his perch in Le Renard (1923), choreographed by Bronislava Nijinska.Baer (1986), p.74 (Le Renard, music by Igor Stravinsky), cf. pp. 29-30. For Ballets Russes' Les F\u00e2cheux (1924), \"Stanislas Idzikowski the bravura dancer [was] cast by Nijinska as Lysandre the dancing master.\" Yet because a dispute arose over the costume's wet dye, Diaghilev asked Nijinska to dance this amusing character, originally created by Moli\u00e8re (Baer, p.41).Garafola (1989), p.409: Nijinska as the Fox, Idzikowski as the Cock, in Le Renard (1923). Having briefly left Ballets Russes in 1924, Idzikowski in 1925 rejoined the company.Oxford Reference. He and Lydia Lopokova left He danced with Alexandra Danilova in its production of Jack in the Box, with music by the late Erik Satie, choreography by George Balanchine.Koegler (1977), p.277: Jack in the Box.Garafola (1989), p.409: \"Jack in the Box\" with Danilova and Idzikowski.The Balanchine Catalogue website. He created the role of the Puppet.Kochno (1970), p.243, Jack in the Box. When Sergei Diaghilev unexpectedly died in 1929, however, the ballet world lost not only the gifted impresario, but also his company as \"the Ballets Russes collapsed\".Garafola (1989), pp. 157 (quote). Diaghilev's death caught the company \"unawares\" and resulted in its \"demise\" (p.376).Koegler (1977), p. 50: For 20 years Diaghilev led \"the ballet of his time in all its forms, until his death in 1929, after which [his] company dissolved.\" ==Soir\u00e9es de Paris, Vic-Wells, other posts== Lydia Lopokova in 1922 In 1924, both on leave from Ballets Russes, Idzikowski appeared with his frequent dance partner Lydia Lopokova at the London Coliseum.Oxford Preference: \"He left the [Ballets Russes] company in 1924 to dance with Lopokova at the Coliseum and with Comte de Beaumont's \u2018Soir\u00e9es de Paris\u2019.\"The New York Times obituary: paired with Lopokova.Cf., Garafola (1989), p.216: Coliseum. She also was drawn to Soir\u00e9es de Paris, a new dance enterprise organized by \u00c9tienne de Beaumont.A Beaumont different from the co-author of Cecchetti book. It was a potential competitor of Diaghilev. \"Artistic considerations\" caused Lopokova to respond \"with enthusiasm to Massine's offer of a place in his new company.\" Idzikowski also signed. Massine at Soir\u00e9e de Paris wrote choreography for new ballets, including Mercure. Picasso designed decor. Staged in Paris, it was the Soir\u00e9e's first and only season.Garafola (2005), pp. 171 (quotes), 172 (\"Stas\", too), 173-178 (Massine), 175, 176, 177 (\"Stas\"). Soir\u00e9es de Paris was similar to Ballets Su\u00e9dois, both being newly founded competitors of Ballets Russes (pp. 171, 177).Kochno (1970), pp. 256-257 (re Mercure). Though friends Diaghilev looked on \"Beaumont as a rival\". Besides his closest collaborators, \"The leading dancers of the new company were Lopoukhova and Idzikowski and the ballet master was Massine, all deserters from his own group\" (.p.256). Soir\u00e9es was short-lived; Mercure then entered Diaghilev's repertoire (p.257).Massine (1968), pp. 158-160, 162. For Soir\u00e9es de Paris, Massine wrote five ballets (p.158), including Mercure (p,159-160). He fails to mention competition with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes.Koegler (1977), p.491: Les Soir\u00e9es de Paris of 1924. \"As a guest artist with the Vic\u2010Wells Ballet in the early 1930s, Mr. Idzikowski lent the prestige of his name to the struggling young company that is now Britain's Royal Ballet.\"The New York Times obituary: quote re Vic-Wells.Oxford Reference: Idikowski as 'guest artist' at Vic-Wells. He developed the lead male role in Les Rendezvous, a ballet-divertissement choreographed by Ashton, mounted in 1933. \"The leading pair of 'lovers' was performed by Alicia Markova and Stanislas Idzikowski.\"Grekovic (2000), p.88 (quote re Les Rendezvous).Balanchine (1954), pp. 309-310: Markova and Idzikowski.Koegler (1977), p.439: Idzikowski in Les Rendezvous. The Vic-Wells company was directed by de Valois, an 'alumnus' of Ballets Russes.Garafola (1989), pp. 376-377: Diaghilev alumni. For Vic-Wells, Idzikowski also performed his well- known Blue Bird role in the revised, one-act Aurora's Wedding, and his Harlequin in Carnaval.David Adams, \"Stanislas Idzikowski\".Cf., Baer (1986), pp. 28, 29: Nijinska's 1922 choreography of the one-act ballet Aurora's Wedding from the five-act The Sleeping Princess. From 1928 to 1930 Idzikowski had managed and directed his own ballet company.Oxford Reference: Stanislas Idzikowski. He later associated with the commercial production of films: The Gods Go a-Begging (1934),Cf., Koegler (1977), p.224. Carnival (1935), and Peg of Old Drury (1935).Stanislas Idzikowski at IMDb (3 films). For several years starting in 1939, Idzikowski served as ballet master for Mona Inglesby's International Ballet.The Independent obituary: Mona Inglesby. ==Book with Beaumont on Cecchetti== Cecchetti, c.1900 In 1918 Enrico Cecchetti (1850-1928), by then a renowned dancer, ballet master and pedagogue,Homans (2010), pp. 241-242. Cecchetti had \"taught most of Diaghilev's [Ballets Russes] dancers' (pp. 291-292).Balanchine (1954), p.471. opened a school in London. Idzikowski, his former student, joined a group of friends and associates in strongly advocating his 'Russo-Italian' method of training students. At Cecchetti's urging, Idzikowski then started to work with the maestro,Cf. Massine (1968), pp. 167-168 (Idzikowski and Cecchetti re the book). and later with the balletomane Cyril W. Beaumont, to preserve and codify the Cecchetti method of teaching. Until then it had been largely developed and handed down orally.\"Cyril Beaumont\" at Cechetti website: method's evolution dated back to 1820s and Carlo Blasis. Demonstration of basic positions and exercises were made by Cecchetti and by Idzikowski, with commentary, which were then drawn by Randolph Schwabe and reduced by Beaumont to a written text. The collaboration resulted in the co-authorship by Beaumont and Idzikowski of a technical manual, completed in 1922.Beaumont and Idzikowski (1922, rev'd 1932; reprint 2003).\"Cyril Beaumont\" at Cechetti website: a more detailed and slightly different narration of book's composition.\"Enrico Cecchetti\" at Cecchetti website.The New York Times obituary: book.Balanchine (1954), p.475: 1922 book. > \"[E]ach pupil is constructed differently, both physically and > temperamentally, so that each requires adaptations of the lesson in order to > supply his own particular needs.\" > \"What then ar the qualifications of an experienced professor? First, his > school-the sources of his own knowledge. Second, his reputation as a teacher > and his distinction as a dancer. Third, his personal qualities; he should be > conscientious, patient, and a good disciplinarian. Fourth, his capacity both > as a practical demonstrator and theoretical exponent. ...\" > \"[A]s your experience increases, you may with advantage study the sister > arts of mime, music, painting, drawing, and sculpture. ... Seek to discover > why these works afford your pleasure. Thus you will learn what is meant by > grace and beauty. Endeavor to apply these same principles to your own art.\" > Beaumont and Idzikowski (2003), pp. 18 and 20 (quotes). Later, the London dancer Celia Franca became a dance student of Idzikowsky.Ambrose & Franca (1954, 1974), p. [vii]: \"This book is dedicated to M. STANISLAS IDZIKOWSKI as a small token of our respect, esteem, and affection by Celia Franca (his grateful pupil), and Kay Ambrose (his sincere admirer).\" Franca became the first artistic director of the National Ballet of Canada and co-founded the National Ballet School of Canada; both institutions use the Cecchetti method. In 1922 Beaumont moved to found the Cecchetti Society,\"Cyril Beaumont\" at Cechetti website. which merged with the ISTD in 1924.Koegler (1977), p.110. ==As ballet teacher in London== Acting as ballet master he had instructed performers in various ballet companies. From 1933 he had taught, eventually from his own dance studio in London. There he was accompanied on piano by his longtime partner Wanda Evina (1891-1966). Since 1916 they had been romantically linked. Evina was British, a professional dancer, and an accomplished pianist.Sokolova (1960, 1989), Wanda Evina: girlfriend of Stanislas in 1916, p.86; Ballets Russes dancer, pp. 102, 136, 229.\"Stanislas Idzikowski\" at (Cecchetti website) by Scott. \"Madame Evina danced with Idzi in the Diaghilev Company\" and later became the pianist at his studio. He worked also with the Royal Academy of Dance.\"Stanislas Idzikowski\"\" at (Cecchetti website) by Adams.Oxford Reference: teaching. Among his students was Margot Fonteyn. She remembered him as a guest teacher during her early years at Sadler's Wells under Ninette de Valois, which would have been in the mid 1930s: > \"My favorite was Stanislas Idzikowski, affectionately known as Idzi, a > brilliant dancer who had been with the Diaghilev Ballet. He was diminutive, > dapper, and precise, speaking rather good English with a clipped Polish > accent. Severe but never unkind, he knew exactly what he expected of his > students and explained clearly how to achieve it.\"Fonteyn (1975, 1976), p. > 52. Following the death of Madame Evina, he retired from ballet at age 72.\"Stanislas Idzikowski\" at (Cecchetti website) by Adams. ==Descriptions of Idzikowski== \"He is quiet, though animated in conversation, but moody and sensitive in the highest degree.\" \"In stature he is short... . His torso and limbs are those of an athlete. The muscular development of his calves and thighs is extraordinary. ... [His] cheek bones high... , wavy hair... almost white... , [with] deep set, blue eyes.\"Beaumont (1926), pp. 2-3. \"He taught class in a suit with the stiff color, the vest, and spats and street shoes. With all this, he could still do a double tour en l'air and land in a perfect fifth.\"David Adams, \"Stanislas Idzikowski\". \"How describe those difficult steps performed with an ease which makes them appear elementary to the ordinary spectator, while the professional onlooker, swayed between astonishment and rapture, can scarce believe the evidence of his eyes.\"Beaumont (1926), p.4, re the ballet Les Sylphides. ==Images on-line== The Art of Stanislas Idzikowsky (London 1926) is a thin volume published in a limited edition of 350 copies, with six visual art works, twelve photographs, and five pages of text. Before the title page comes Glyn Philpot's monochrome portrait. The text by Cyril W. Beaumont then describes Idzikowski in various roles and as a presence in ballet. A sketch by Randolph Schwabe is of the dancer in costume, seated in his dressing room. Following are four color images of Idzikowski in ballet poses, reproductions of paintings by Vera Willoughby. Lastly, the twelve publicity photographs are of him in various costumes of his choreographed roles.See below, External Links: Art of Stanislas Idzikowsky website. A brief {1:32}, low quality video of Idzikowski and Lydia Lopokova exists. The two were often paired. Here they are in costume as the Harlequin and Columbine in the ballet Le Carnaval. Lopokova was married to John Maynard Keynes, the English economist.Homans (2010), pp. 410-411 (husband Keynes).See External Links: \"Ballets Russes on film...\" showing a very brief clip, at youtube.com. ==References== ==Bibliography== ===Primary=== *Cyril W.
