    "text": "Herbert Norkus (26 July 1916 - 24 January 1932) was a Hitler Youth member who was killed by German Communists. He became a role model and martyr for the Hitler Youth and was widely used in Nazi propaganda, most prominently as the subject of novel and film Hitler Youth Quex. == Background == Born to a working class family in the Tiergarten district of Berlin, Norkus joined the equivalent of the sea scouts of the Hitler Youth organisation. He was reported to have enjoyed playing the piano and drawing. His father had been wounded in World War I, and supposedly had Communist sympathies. The official Nazi biographies of Norkus claimed his father initially opposed his son's Nazi activities but was ultimately converted and became a Nazi too. Clashes between the Hitler Youth and the Communist Red Front youth movement (Rote Jungfront) were becoming increasingly common as the NSDAP and the German Communist Party struggled for power in the waning days of the Weimar Republic. His comrades nicknamed him \u201cQuex\u201d because \u201dhe carried out orders faster than quicksilver\u201d ().Baird, Jay W.: To Die for Germany. Heroes in the Nazi Pantheon, Bloomington 1992, p. 120. == Death == On 24 January 1932, 15-year-old Herbert Norkus and other Hitler Youth members were distributing leaflets advertising a forthcoming Nazi rally. The group was confronted by Communists. Norkus fought them off and ran to a nearby house for help. A man answered and slammed the door in his face. Norkus was then stabbed six times by the pursuing Communists. He banged on another door, which was answered by a woman who tried to get him to a hospital, however he died on arrival.Baird (1992), p. 115. == \"Hitlerjunge Quex\" == Writer Karl Aloys Schenzinger made Norkus into a role model for the Hitler Youth in a popular Nazi novel, Der Hitlerjunge Quex (1932). In 1933, it was made into a film directed by Hans Steinhoff, with Heinrich George in a leading role as the boy's father. The novel was required reading for all members of the Hitler Youth. == Honors == Passau named a street after Norkus.Anna Rosmus Hitlers Nibelungen, Samples Grafenau 2015, pp. 249f A German Navy school ship called the Herbert Norkus was named in his honor, but it was never completed because of the war. Many schools, streets and squares were also named after him during the Nazi period. ==See also== ;Others given posthumous fame by the Nazis: *Wilhelm Gustloff *Horst Wessel *List of Nazis who died in the Beer Hall Putsch == References == ;Notes ;General reference * Arnold Littmann: Herbert Norkus und die Hitlerjungen vom Beu\u00dfelkietz.
