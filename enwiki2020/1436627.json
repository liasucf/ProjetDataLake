    "text": "Nuevo Laredo () is a city in the Municipality of Nuevo Laredo in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. The city lies on the banks of the Rio Grande, across from the American city of the same name. The 2010 census population of the city was 373,725. Nuevo Laredo is part of the Laredo-Nuevo Laredo Metropolitan Area with a population of 636,516. The municipality has an area of . Both the city and the municipality rank as the third largest in the state. The city is connected to Laredo, Texas by three international bridges and a rail bridge. The city is larger and younger than its American counterpart. As an indication of its economic importance, one of Mexico's banderas monumentales is in the city (these banderas have been established in state capitals and cities of significance). ==History== Nuevo Laredo was part of the territory of the original settlement of Laredo (now in Texas) which was founded in 1755 by the Spaniard Don Tom\u00e1s S\u00e1nchez in the northern part of the Rio Grande. The settlement's territory was granted to Jos\u00e9 de Escand\u00f3n by the King of Spain, and the settlement's territory and population remained unified for ninety years, until the war of 1846\u20131848, the Mexican\u2013American War. Early in 1848, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo divided the territory attached to Laredo between the United States (specifically, Texas) and Mexico. Nuevo Laredo was founded on June 15, 1848, by seventeen Laredo families who wished to remain Mexican and therefore moved to the Mexican side of the Rio Grande. They identified with Mexico, its history, and its cultural customs, and decided to keep their Mexican citizenship. The founders of Nuevo Laredo even took with them the bones of their ancestors so they would continue to rest in Mexican ground. ===Drug-related violence=== As a border town, Nuevo Laredo is known for its turf war in which drug cartels compete for control of the drug trade into the United States. Nuevo Laredo is a lucrative drug corridor because of the large volume of trucks that pass through the area, and the multiple exploitable ports of entry. Nuevo Laredo is the base of Los Zetas, originally the armed wing of the Gulf Cartel; the two organizations separated in early 2010 and have been fighting for the control of the smuggling routes to the United States. As of 2012, Los Zetas are thought to be Mexico's largest criminal organization. Drug violence involving the Sinaloa and Gulf Cartels escalated in 2003, when the city was controlled by the Gulf Cartel. 2012 has seen an unprecedented series of mass murder attacks in the city between the Sinaloa Cartel and Gulf Cartel on one side and Los Zetas on the other. ==Geography== Nuevo Laredo is in the northern tip of Tamaulipas on the west end of the Rio Grande Plains. Rio Grande is the only source that supplies its citizens with water. El Coyote Creek supplies Nuevo Laredo's only natural lake El Laguito (The Small Lake). The area consists of a few hills and flat land covered with grass, oak, and mesquite. == Climate == Nuevo Laredo features a semi-arid climate. Nuevo Laredo's weather is influenced by its proximity to the Chihuahuan Desert to the west, by the Sierra Madre Oriental mountains to the south and west, and by the Gulf of Mexico to the east. Much of the moisture from the Pacific is blocked by the Sierra Madre Oriental. Therefore, most of the moisture derives from the Gulf of Mexico. Its geographic location causes Nuevo Laredo's weather to range from long periods of heat to sudden violent storms in a short period of time. Nuevo Laredo is cold for Tamaulipas standards during winter, the average daytime highs are around and overnight lows around ; although it is rare for snow to fall in Nuevo Laredo, there was actually snow on the ground for a few hours on the morning of Christmas Day 2004. Nuevo Laredo experiences an average high temperature of about , and an average low of about during summer, and of rain per year. As Laredo sometimes undergoes drought, a water conservation ordinance was implemented in 2003. == Government == Nuevo Laredo is governed by an elected Cabildo, which is composed of the Presidente Municipal (Municipal President or Mayor), two S\u00edndicos, and twenty Regidores. The PAN is in control of the city government. The Mayor is in charge of the municipal administration. The S\u00edndicos supervise the municipal budget and expenditures, and the Regidores are elected by the party. === Public safety === Public safety is provided by three municipal departments: (1) municipal police (Direcci\u00f3n de Seguridad Ciudadana), (2) traffic control (Direcci\u00f3n de Seguridad Vial), and (3) the emergency services department (Direcci\u00f3n de Protecci\u00f3n Civil, Bomberos y Desastres). As well as the State Police Force Tamaulipas (\"Fuerza Tamaulipas\") replacing former Acreditable State Police (\"Pol\u00edcia Estatal Acreditable\") Because of the drug- related violence, Federal level departments take part in the security effort, SEDENA Military Police (\"Pol\u00edcia Military\") Mexican Army Troops, SEMAR Mexican Navy Troops and Federal Police. ==Economy== The Monument to mothers in front of the Best Western Plus Nuevo Laredo Hotel. Nuevo Laredo (along with Laredo, Texas) is the most important trade border crossing of Latin America (approximately 8500 trucks cross the border each day).

Nuevo Laredo is the only Mexico/U.S. border city strategically positioned at the convergence of all land transportation systems. The main highway and railroad leading from Central Mexico through Mexico City, San Luis Potos\u00ed, Saltillo and Monterrey join with two major U.S. rail lines at Nuevo Laredo and major American highway Interstate 35, thus offering fast access to the most important metropolitan areas and seaports of Texas, as well as northern states and Canada. For more than a decade, Mexico's economic policies have greatly increased Mexico/U.S. trade and cross-border production in the Nuevo Laredo area. There are three bridges in the Nuevo Laredo area: International Bridge #1 (the oldest); International Bridge #2 (also known as Juarez-Lincoln; no pedestrians); International Bridge #3 (also known as the Free Trade or Libre Comercio Bridge; inaugurated in 1999; cargo only).
