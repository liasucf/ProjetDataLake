It is the largest city municipality in the region and the second largest in northeast Italy. The metropolitan area of Verona covers an area of and has a population of 714,310 inhabitants.\"Tales of Verona\" It is one of the main tourist destinations in northern Italy because of its artistic heritage and several annual fairs, shows, and operas, such as the lyrical season in the Arena, an ancient Roman amphitheater. Between the 13th and 14th century the city was ruled by the Della Scala Family. Under the rule of the family, in particular of Cangrande I della Scala, the city experienced great prosperity, becoming powerful, rich and being surrounded with new walls. The Della Scala era is survived in numerous monuments around Verona. Two of William Shakespeare's plays are set in Verona: Romeo and Juliet (which also features\u2019 Romeo\u2019s sojourn to Mantua) and The Two Gentlemen of Verona. It is unknown if Shakespeare ever visited Verona or Italy, but his plays have lured many visitors to Verona and surrounding cities. The city has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO because of its urban structure and architecture. == History == Ponte Pietra in Verona|alt=|left The precise details of Verona's early history remain a mystery. One theory is it was a city of the Euganei, who were obliged to give it up to the Cenomani (550 BC). With the conquest of the Valley of the Po, the Veronese territory became Roman (about 300 BC). Verona became a Roman colonia in 89 BC. It was classified as a municipium in 49 BC, when its citizens were ascribed to the Roman tribe Poblilia or Publicia. The city became important because it was at the intersection of several roads. Stilicho defeated Alaric and his Visigoths here in 403. But, after Verona was conquered by the Ostrogoths in 489, the Gothic domination of Italy began. Theoderic the Great was said to have built a palace there. It remained under the power of the Goths throughout the Gothic War (535\u2013552), except for a single day in 541, when the Byzantine officer Artabazes made an entrance. The defections that took place among the Byzantine generals with regard to the booty made it possible for the Goths to regain possession of the city. In 552 Valerian vainly endeavored to enter the city, but it was only when the Goths were fully overthrown that they surrendered it. In 569, it was taken by Alboin, King of the Lombards, in whose kingdom it was, in a sense, the second most important city. There, Alboin was killed by his wife in 572. The dukes of Treviso often resided there. Adalgisus, son of Desiderius, in 774 made his last desperate resistance in Verona to Charlemagne, who had destroyed the Lombard kingdom. Verona became the ordinary residence of the kings of Italy, the government of the city becoming hereditary in the family of Count Milo, progenitor of the counts of San Bonifacio. From 880 to 951 the two Berengarii resided there. Otto I ceded to Verona the marquisate dependent on the Duchy of Bavaria. When Ezzelino III da Romano was elected podest\u00e0 in 1226, he converted the office into a permanent lordship. In 1257 he caused the slaughter of 11,000 Paduans on the plain of Verona (Campi di Verona). Upon his death, the Great Council elected Mastino I della Scala as podest\u00e0, and he converted the \"signoria\" into a family possession, though leaving the burghers a share in the government. Failing to be re-elected podest\u00e0 in 1262, he effected a coup d'\u00e9tat, and was acclaimed capitano del popolo, with the command of the communal troops. Long internal discord took place before he succeeded in establishing this new office, to which was attached the function of confirming the podest\u00e0. In 1277, Mastino della Scala was killed by the faction of the nobles. Cangrande I|alt=|left The reign of his son Alberto as capitano (1277\u20131302) was a time of incessant war against the counts of San Bonifacio, who were aided by the House of Este. Of his sons, Bartolomeo, Alboino and Cangrande I, only the last shared the government (1308); he was great as warrior, prince, and patron of the arts; he protected Dante, Petrarch, and Giotto. By war or treaty, he brought under his control the cities of Padua (1328), Treviso (1308) and Vicenza. At this time before the Black death the city was home to more than 40,000 people.David Abulafia, Short Oxford History of Italy: Italy in the Central Middle Ages, Oxford University Press, 2004 The left Cangrande was succeeded by Mastino II (1329\u20131351) and Alberto, sons of Alboino. Mastino continued his uncle's policy, conquering Brescia in 1332 and carrying his power beyond the Po. He purchased Parma (1335) and Lucca (1339). After the King of France, he was the richest prince of his time. But a powerful league was formed against him in 1337 \u2013 Florence, Venice, the Visconti, the Este, and the Gonzaga. After a three years war, the Scaliger dominions were reduced to Verona and Vicenza (Mastino's daughter Regina-Beatrice della Scala married to Barnab\u00f2 Visconti). Mastino's son Cangrande II (1351\u20131359) was a cruel, dissolute, and suspicious tyrant; not trusting his own subjects, he surrounded himself with Brandenburg mercenaries. He was killed by his brother Cansignorio (1359\u20131375), who beautified the city with palaces, provided it with aqueducts and bridges, and founded the state treasury. He also killed his other brother, Paolo Alboino. Fratricide seems to have become a family custom, for Antonio (1375\u201387), Cansignorio's natural brother, slew his brother Bartolomeo, thereby arousing the indignation of the people, who deserted him when Gian Galeazzo Visconti of Milan made war on him. Having exhausted all his resources, he fled from Verona at midnight (19 October 1387), thus putting an end to the Scaliger domination, which, however, survived in its monuments. The year 1387 is also the year of the Battle of Castagnaro, between Giovanni Ordelaffi, for Verona, and John Hawkwood, for Padua, who was the winner. Antonio's son Canfrancesco attempted in vain to recover Verona (1390). Guglielmo (1404), natural son of Cangrande II, was more fortunate; with the support of the people, he drove out the Milanese, but he died ten days after, and Verona then submitted to Venice (1405). The last representatives of the Scaligeri lived at the imperial court and repeatedly attempted to recover Verona by the aid of popular risings. From 1508 to 1517, the city was in the power of the Emperor Maximilian I. There were numerous outbreaks of the plague, and in 1629\u201333 Italy was struck by its worst outbreak in modern times. Around 33,000 people died in Verona (over 60 per cent of the population at the time) in 1630\u20131631.\"Epidemics and pandemics: their impacts on human history\". J. N. Hays (2005). p.103. In 1776 was developed a method of bellringing called Veronese bellringing art. Verona was occupied by Napoleon in 1797, but on Easter Monday the populace rose and drove out the French. It was then that Napoleon made an end of the Venetian Republic. Verona became Austrian territory when Napoleon signed the Treaty of Campo Formio in October 1797. The Austrians took control of the city on 18 January 1798. It was taken from Austria by the Treaty of Pressburg in 1805 and became part of Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy, but was returned to Austria following Napoleon's defeat in 1814, when it became part of the Austrian-held Kingdom of Lombardy- Venetia. The Congress of Verona, which met on 20 October 1822, was part of the series of international conferences or congresses, opening with the Congress of Vienna in 1814\u201315, that marked the effective breakdown of the \"Concert of Europe\". In 1866, following the Third Italian War of Independence, Verona, along with the rest of Venetia, became part of United Italy. The alt= The advent of fascism added another dark chapter to the annals of Verona. As throughout Italy, the Jewish population was hit by the Manifesto of Race, a series of anti-Semitic laws passed in 1938, and after the invasion by Nazi Germany in 1943, deportations to Nazi concentration camps. An Austrian Fort (now a church, the Santuario della Madonna di Lourdes), was used to incarcerate and torture Allied troops, Jews and anti-fascists, especially after 1943, when Verona became part of the Italian Social Republic. As in Austrian times, Verona became of great strategic importance to the regime. Galeazzo Ciano, Benito Mussolini's son-in-law, was accused of plotting against the republic; in a show trial staged in January 1944 by the Nazi and fascist hierarchy at Castelvecchio (the Verona trial), Ciano was executed on the banks of the Adige with many other officers on what is today Via Colombo. This marked another turning point in the escalation of violence that would only end with the final liberation by allied troops and partisans in 1945. After World War II, as Italy entered into NATO, Verona once again acquired its strategic importance, due to its closeness to the Iron Curtain. The city became the seat of SETAF (South European Allied Terrestrial Forces) and had during the whole duration of the Cold War period a strong military presence, especially American, which has since decreased. == Geography == === Climate === Verona has a humid subtropical climate characteristic of Northern Italy's inland plains, with hot summers and cold, humid winters, even though Lake Garda has a partial influence on the city.Thomas A. Blair, Climatology: General and Regional, Prentice Hall pages 131\u2013132; Adriana Rigutti, Meteorologia, Giunti, p, 95, 2009. The relative humidity is high throughout the year, especially in winter when it causes fog, mainly from dusk until late morning, although the phenomenon has become less and less frequent in recent years. == Demographics == {| class=\"infobox\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" |2017 largest resident foreign-born groupsCittadini Stranieri - Verona |- !Country of birth||Population |- | Romania||12,520 |- | Sri Lanka||7,234 |- | Moldova||5,008 |- | Nigeria||3,233 |- | Morocco||2,857 |- | Albania||2,500 |- | China||1,975 |- | Ghana||1,444 |} In 2009, there were 265,368 people residing in Verona, located in the province of Verona, Veneto, of whom 47.6% were male and 52.4% were female. Minors (children aged 0\u201317) totalled 16.05% of the population compared to pensioners who number 22.36%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners).

Verona preserved many ancient Roman monuments (including the magnificent Arena) in the early Middle Ages, but many of its early medieval edifices were destroyed or heavily damaged by the earthquake of 3 January 1117, which led to a massive Romanesque rebuilding. The Carolingian period Versus de Verona contains an important description of Verona in the early medieval era. ===Roman edifices=== Verona Arena The Roman military settlement in what is now the centre of the city was to expand through the cardines and decumani that intersect at right angles. This structure has been kept to the present day and is clearly visible from the air. Further development has not reshaped the original map. Though the Roman city with its basalt-paved roads is mostly hidden from view it stands virtually intact about 6 m below the surface. Most palazzi and houses have cellars built on Roman structures that are rarely accessible to visitors. Piazza delle Erbe Piazza delle Erbe, near the Roman forum was rebuilt by Cangrande I and Cansignorio della Scala I, lords of Verona, using material (such as marble blocks and statues) from Roman spas and villas. Verona is famous for its Roman amphitheatre, the Arena, found in the city's largest piazza, the Piazza Bra. Completed around 30 AD, it is the third largest in Italy after Rome's Colosseum and the arena at Capua. It measures 139 metres long and 110 metres wide, and could seat some 25,000 spectators in its 44 tiers of marble seats. The ludi (shows and gladiator games) performed within its walls were so famous that they attracted spectators from far beyond the city. The current two-story fa\u00e7ade is actually the internal support for the tiers; only a fragment of the original outer perimeter wall in white and pink limestone from Valpolicella, with three stories remains.The interior is very impressive and is virtually intact, and has remained in use even today for public events, fairs, theatre and open-aired opera during warm summer nights. Porta Borsari There is also a variety of other Roman monuments to be found in the town, such as the Roman theatre of Verona. This theatre was built in the 1st century BC, but through the ages had fallen in disuse and had been built upon to provide housing. In the 18th century Andrea Monga, a wealthy Veronese, bought all the houses that in time had been built over the theatre, demolished them, and saved the monument. Not far from it is the Ponte di Pietra (\"Stone Wall Bridge\"), another Roman landmark that has survived to this day. The Arco dei Gavi (Gavi Arch) was built in the 1st century AD, and is famous for having the name of the builder (architect Lucius Vitruvius Cordone) engraved on it, a rare case in the architecture of the epoque. It originally straddled the main Roman road into the city, now the Corso Cavour. It was demolished by French troops in 1805 and rebuilt in 1932. Piazza dei Signori San Zeno Basilica, like many other Veronese churches, is built with alternating layers of white stone and bricks Juliet's house The Portoni della Bra Nearby is the Porta Borsari, an archway at the end of Corso Porta Borsari. This is the fa\u00e7ade of a 3rd- century gate in the original Roman city walls. The inscription is dated 245 AD and gives the city name as Colonia Verona Augusta. Corso Porta Borsari, the road passing through the gate is the original Via Sacra of the Roman city. Today, it is lined with several Renaissance palazzi and the ancient Church of Santi Apostoli, a few metres from Piazza delle Erbe. Porta Leoni is the 1st century BC ruin of what was once part of the Roman city gate. A substantial portion is still standing as part of the wall of a medieval building. The street itself is an open archaeological site, and the remains of the original Roman street and gateway foundations can be seen a few feet below the present street level. As can be seen from there, the gate contains a small court guarded by towers. Here, carriages and travelers were inspected before entering or leaving the city. ===Medieval architecture=== The Verona Cathedral Santa Maria Antica Sant'Anastasia San Giorgio in Braida *The Basilica of San Zeno Maggiore is Romanesque style church, the third such structure on its site, built from 1123\u20131135, over the 4th-century shrine to Verona's patron saint, St. Zeno (died 380). The fa\u00e7ade dominates the large square, and is flanked with a 72-metre-tall bell tower, which is mentioned by Dante in Canto 18 of Purgatory in the Divine Comedy. The weathered Veronese stone gives a warm golden glow, and the restrained lines of the pillars, columns, and cornices, and the gallery with its double windows, give the fa\u00e7ade an air of harmonious elegance. The huge rose window is decorated as a Wheel of Fortune. The lintels above the portal have carvings of the months of the year. Each side of the doorway is embellished with 18 bas-relief panels of biblical scenes, and the inner bronze door panels have 48 primitive but forceful depictions of Biblical scenes and episodes from the life of St Zeno. The meaning of some of the scenes is now unknown, but the extraordinarily vivid energy of the figures is a superb blend of traditional and Ottonian influences. The interior of the church is divided into the Lower Church, occupying about \u2154 of the structure, and the Upper Church, occupying the remainder. The walls are covered with 12th and 14th century frescos and the ceiling of the nave is a magnificent example of a ship's keel ceiling. The vaulted crypt contains the tomb of St. Zeno, the first Bishop of Verona, as well as the tombs of several other saints. North of the church is a pleasant cloister. The church also houses the tomb of King Pippin of Italy (777\u2013810). *The Basilica of San Lorenzo is another Romanesque church, albeit smaller. It dates from around 1177, but was built on the site of a Paleochristian church, fragments of which remain. The church is built of alternating tracks of brick and stone, and has two cylindrical towers, housing spiral staircases to the women's galleries. The interior is sober, but still quiet. The striped bands of stone and brick and the graceful arches complement the setting. *Santa Maria Antica is a small Romanesque church that served as the private chapel of the Scaligeri clan, and is famous for the Gothic Scaliger Tombs. The Duomo is also a notable Romanesque church. *Sant'Anastasia is a huge and lofty church built from 1290\u20131481 by the Dominicans to hold the massive congregations attracted by their sermons. The Pellegrini chapel houses the fresco St. George and the Princess of Trebizond by Pisanello as well as the grave of Wilhelm von Bibra. An art festival is held in the square each may. With a span length of , the segmental arch bridge Ponte Scaligero featured, at the time of its completion in 1356, the world's largest bridge arch. ==Notable people== * Aleardo Aleardi, a poet * Berto Barbarani, poet * Paolo Bellasio, composer of the Renaissance; member of the Roman School * Stefano Bernardi, baroque composer * Massimo Bubola, singer-songwriter born in Terrazzo * Paolo Caliari, well known as \"Veronese\" painter * Lou Campi, professional bowler * Mario Capecchi, Nobel prize in Medicine, 2007 * Giovanni Francesco Caroto, painter * Catullus, Latin poet * Walter Chiari, actor * Gigliola Cinquetti, singer who brought Italy its first Eurovision Song Contest win in 1964 * Lorenzo Comendich, painter * Damiano Cunego, former world number 1 cyclist and former Giro d'Italia winner * Giorgio de Stefani, tennis player, finalist at the 1932 French Open * Franco Donatoni, composer * Gino Fano, mathematician * Girolamo Fracastoro, also known as Fracastorius, renowned scholar, physician and poet * Giovanni Giocondo, architect and scholar * Girolamo dai Libri, illuminator of manuscripts and painter * Romano Guardini, theologian * Marc' Antonio Ingegneri, composer, teacher of Claudio Monteverdi * Ernestine von Kirchsberg, Austrian landscape painter * Cesare Lombroso, criminologist * Scipione Maffei, writer and historian * Matteo Manassero, British amateur golf champion, 2009 * Arnoldo Mondadori, editor * Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet, fictional characters from the well known Shakespearian play Romeo and Juliet * Marcantonio Negri, Baroque composer, associate of Monteverdi * Carlo Pedrotti, 19th-century composer, conductor, voice teacher and opera administrator * St. Peter Martyr, Dominican preacher and saint * Ippolito Pindemonte, poet * Ratherius, Medieval bishop and writer * Francesca Rettondini, actress * Carlo Rovelli, physicist and writer * Vincenzo Ruffo, composer of the Renaissance * Emilio Salgari, novelist * Antonio Salieri, composer * Michele Sammicheli, architect * Sara Simeoni, former world high jump primatist and Olympic gold medalist * Marco Stroppa, composer * Bartolomeo Tromboncino, composer of the Renaissance period * Giorgio Zancanaro, baritone Verona was the birthplace of Catullus, and the town that Julius Caesar chose for relaxing stays.

In addition to regional and local services the city is served by direct international trains to Zurich, Innsbruck and Munich and by overnight sleeper services to Paris and Dijon (Thello), Munich and Vienna (\u00d6BB). Verona's main station is Verona Porta Nuova railway station, to the south of the city centre. It is considered to be the ninth busiest railway station in Italy, handling approximately 68,000 passengers per day, or 25 million passengers per year. There is a lesser station to the east of the city at Porta Vescovo, which used to be the main station in Verona, but now only receives trains between Venice and Porta Nuova. ===Airport=== Verona airport Verona Airport is located southwest of Verona.
