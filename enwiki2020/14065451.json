    "text": "Rastoder or Hrastoder is a Slavic surname. The bearers are predominantly Bosniaks of Montenegro and Muslims by nationality originating from Bihor, a region in northern Montenegro (Sand\u017eak), which encompasses parts of the municipalities of Berane and Bijelo Polje. Earlier, the letter R was preceded by the letter H, which was lost over time. One of the legends says that the surname was obtained from an oak tree, of which there are many in the area where this surname originated. One of the oral traditions and legends also says that the Rastoderi originated from the village of Dupilo in Crmnica, municipality of Bar, and that earlier, before accepting Islam, their last name was Petrovi\u0107i.Residents with the surname Rastoder are from the village of Petnjica, Radmanci,Savin Bor municipality of Berane in Montenegro. Sand\u017eak region was originally the smallest administrative unit of the Ottoman Empire, later part of the province - vilayet. The Turkish ( Sanca\u011f\u0131 ), word sandzak means \"flag\". Is geographical area administratively divided between Serbia and Montenegro . ==History== According to a legend, the ancestors of the Rastoder family were from Ku\u010di. These ancestors emigrated from Ku\u010di either in the 17th or 18th century. One part of the family went to Dupilo in Crmnica, and the other to the mountains of Plav, of which the Medunjani descend from. The family in Dupilo, because of a blood revenge (krvna osveta, or gjakmarrje), emigrated north, but a part of the family (known as the Petrovi\u0107 at that time) decided to stay. The descendants of these Petrovi\u0107s claim that the Metropolitan of Cetinje told them that they couldn't be known as Petrovi\u0107 any longer, so they instead adopted the name Hrstoderi (later Hrastoderi) because they avenged and hung a man on an oak tree (hrast), hence their surname. Another saying, not too different from the previous one, says that the ancestors of the Rastoders emigrated to Radmanci and converted to Islam. They didn't have enough food when they arrived in Radmanci, so they peeled off the bark of oak trees (hrastovi) in order to enlarge the amount of flour for bread. It is not excluded that by that only oak valley came the surname Hrastoder. A third story, more of a legend, says that before the coming of the Turks, there lived some Rasodijeri, however, it is not certain whether if they were Bogomils or others, maybe even Pagans, but later converted to Islam. They were recorded in books in mosques as Hrastoderi rather than Rasodijeri. The surname without the H (Rastoder) was realised during and after the period of the Kingdom of Montenegro, in the registers, instead of being located in mosques, were located in local town and the Hrastoderi were recorded as Rastoderi as the registrars were Montenegrins and even today, the phoneme H isn't pronounced by Montenegrins and wasn't either at that time. Some descendants of Rastoder families of Bihor have changed their surnames, such as the Kr\u0161i\u0107 and Nurkovi\u0107 in Ro\u017eaje, as well as Medunjanin. ==People== *Osman Rastoder, (1882\u20131946) Montenegrin Bosniak religious leader and pro-Nazi collaborator.
