    "text": "Domenico Pozzovivo (born 30 November 1982) is an Italian professional road racing cyclist, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam . His very small stature confer him with the qualities of a pure climbing specialist. He is most known for a victory in stage 8 of the 2012 Giro d'Italia, an overall victory in the 2012 Giro del Trentino, and is notable for his high education. ==Personal life== Pozzovivo has a degree in economics and wrote a thesis entitled \"Southern politics from the unity of Italy up to now\". His high education has earned him the nickname \"Dr. Pozzovivo\" in the peloton. He stated that his fields of interest outside cycling are history, technology, economics, politics and weather forecasts. He also speaks French fluently and stated that a jump into politics would interest him after his cycling career. ==Career== In 2008, Pozzovivo finished on the third step of the podium of the Giro del Trentino, which had a race categorization of 2.1. The first place went to Vincenzo Nibali of while Stefano Garzelli from the took the second place. He then participated in his third Giro d'Italia. While he was not considered a favorite for the overall rankings prior to the race, he managed to finish in ninth position of the general classification. He notably took the second position on the fifteenth stage, a mountain affair finishing atop the Category 1 Passo Fedaia, which was featured for the first time in Giro history. He was bested only by his team-mate Emanuele Sella, who eventually tested positive for the blood booster MIRCERA and was later disqualified. ===2009=== In 2009, Pozzovivo took the fifth stage of the Settimana Ciclistica Lombarda, his first major victory since 2004. He also finished second in the general classification of the mountainous Brixia Tour, more than a minute behind the winner Giampaolo Caruso. He placed in the top ten of three stages in that race, including third on the second stage, three second in arrears of Leonardo Bertagnolli. ===2010=== The 2010 season saw Pozzovivo take a great stage victory in the Giro del Trentino, where he edged a surging from behind Riccardo Ricc\u00f2 of by 3 seconds. Pozzovivo finally took the third place overall, with the Kazakh Alexander Vinokourov of taking the top honors. Pozzovivo came in second place of the 2.1 categorized Giro dell'Appennino, where he attacked on the daunting Passo della Bocchetta, with only Robert Kiserlovski being able to follow him and crest the climb with him. The pair collaborated well to the finish, where Pozzovivo was bested by the man in the sprint, therefore taking second place. In July, the diminutive Pozzovivo won the Brixia Tour, winning two mountain stages in the process. He prevailed in the overall classification of the five stage race by a margin of one minute and fifty seconds over 's Morris Possoni. ===2012=== Domenico Pozzovivo before the start of an individual time trial in the Giro d'Italia 2012 in Milan In 2012, Pozzovivo won the prestigious Giro del Trentino. He was victorious in stage 3 of that race, which led the riders from Pergine to Brenzone, finishing after a steep climb, the Punta Veleno. Team cars were not allowed on that climb since it was very steep and the tarmac was inappropriate. Motorbikes were the only resource available for riders suffering a mechanical problem. The victory on that hard stage granted him the leader's jersey, which he managed to hold on to the following day on the fourth and final stage, which was disputed in snowy weather conditions. He finished that stage in third position. He also won the Mountains classification jersey. Later that year, he sailed to victory in stage 8 of the Giro d'Italia, attacking on the slopes of the Colle Molella, away from the finish. His nearest pursuant, Spaniard Benat Intxausti of , completed the stage with a 23 seconds deficit on Pozzovivo. He finished the Giro eighth overall, being always very competitive in the mountain stages. In June, Pozzovivo prevailed in the queen stage of the 2.1 rated Tour of Slovenia, a course peppered with climbs. Pozzovivo broke away with Janez Brajkovi\u010d of and somewhat surprisingly, beat Brajkovi\u010d in the sprint. With that operation, he took the overall classification leader's jersey thanks to a six-second lead over Brajkovi\u010d, but lost it the next day in the individual time trial, where Brajkovi\u010d bested him by ten seconds. Pozzovivo had to settle for the second place of the Tour. In the fall, Pozzovivo took part in the Italian Classic Giro dell'Emillia and launched an attack in the steepest part of the final climb, while he was part of a small leading group of three riders. Nairo Quintana () resisted in his wheel to place an attack of his own, which would prove to be the decisive move as the Colombian sailed to victory. Pozzovivo was passed by two competitors in the final meters and took the fourth place. Days later, Pozzovivo abandoned during the Giro di Lombardia, a race which suited him well in the past. The cold and heavy rain played a part in this outcome, as none of his Colnago team-mates reached the finish line either. ===2013=== For the 2013 season, Pozzovivo left , where he started his professional career back in 2005, and moved to World Tour outfit . He was looking to repeat his 2012 win in the Giro del Trentino, but he had to withdraw after a crash in stage 3 of the race where he injured his elbow and broke two ribs. Due to this injury, and some unfortunate crashes, he was unable to perform to his best ability in the Giro d'Italia, although he still managed to finish 10th overall, his third top ten in the Giro. In the Vuelta, Pozzovivo was able to return to his best. He was consistently in the top 10 during the mountain stages, and ended up finishing 6th overall, his highest finish thus far in a Grand Tour. He particularly surprised in the Stage 11 Time Trial, a discipline which generally does not suit him, where he finished third behind winner Fabian Cancellara and World Champion time trial champion at the time Tony Martin. ===2014=== Pozzovivo at the 2014 Giro d'Italia Pozzovivo took part in the Roma Maxima, where he escaped with Alejandro Valverde. The pair maintained their lead until the bunch caught Pozzovivo metres before the line. Valverde won, while Pozzovivo took fifth place. He finished sixth in the Tirreno\u2013Adriatico stage race a week later. Pozzovivo continued his preparation for his main goal in 2014, the Giro d'Italia, by racing the Giro del Trentino, where he finished second to Cadel Evans.http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/giro-del- trentino-2014/stage-4/photos/302334 Two days later, he was one of the main protagonists in Liege-Bastogne-Liege, a race he was participating in for the first time. He attacked with Julian Arredondo on the Cote de Roche aux Faucons, and although he was caught, he attacked again with Giampaolo Caruso on the Cote de Saint-Nicolas, and was caught with only 200 meters to go, eventually finishing 5th.http://www.cyclingquotes.com/news/pozzovivo_shines_in_liege/ Pozzovivo started the Giro well, avoiding any crashes during the wet opening week and attacking on Stage 9 to Sestola, where he finished third on the day behind the breakaway, taking 30 seconds from his rivals and moving into 4th in the General Classification.https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/giro-ditalia- weening-wins-stage-nine-pozzovivo-impresses-145341515--spt.html He also attacked successfully on Stage 14 to Oropa, but fell ill with Bronchitis on the next day, a mountain top finish at Montecampione, losing time to nearly all his rivals.http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/pozzovivo-suffering-with- bronchitis-at-giro-ditalia He managed to recover sufficiently during the rest day to win back time on the remaining peloton on the Queen Stage up to Val Martello on Stage 16, after Nairo Quintana, Pierre Rolland and Ryder Hesjedal had gone away earlier in the stage. He also managed to move up in the overall standings on both Stages 18 and 19, a mountain-top finish and an uphill time trial.http://velonews.competitor.com/2014/05/gallery/gallery-2014-giro- ditalia-stage-19_330238 He eventually finished in 5th place, his highest ever finish in the Giro up to that point and his first ever top-5 finish in a Grand Tour. Pozzovivo did not participate in the Tour de France to focus his efforts on the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a. However, he had to forget the Spain Grand Tour when he crashed in training, breaking his tibia. Pozzovivo said in an interview that he was able to bicycle before he was able to walk on his way to recovery and that he sent his team an e-mail to the effect that he was ready to come back sooner than expected, at the Il Lombardia race. \u201cIt\u2019s a crazy idea and so it might not be taken into consideration [by the team]. I have suffered and I still suffer physically but I believe that that the head makes the difference.\u201d Ultimately, Pozzovivo's return race was Milano\u2013Torino at the end of 2014 and he did race the Il Lombardia race afterward. ===2015=== Domenico Pozzovivo at the 2015 Tour de Suisse Pozzovivo started his season in January at Australia's Tour Down Under, despite suffering from a minor wrist fracture. He stated he was aiming for a top 5 Overall. He finally finished sixth in the general classification. In March, he went on to finish eighth overall in Tirreno\u2013Adriatico. He grabbed his first victory since 2012 on a stage of the Volta a Catalunya. He was part of a group of seven favorites and he attacked two kilometers from the finish line to win solo on the flat finale, after the race went over several climbs. He finally finished the stage race on the third step of the podium. At the end of April, Pozzovivo participated in the mountainous Giro del Trentino. He lost time on Stage 2, but made up for it by taking the stage victory on Stage 3, distancing Richie Porte and Mikel Landa by five seconds after attacking with two kilometers remaining. He finally finished seventh in the general classification of the race. Two days after the Giro del Trentino concluded, Pozzovivo finished eighth of Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge as part of the leading group. Pozzovivo's next objective was the Giro d'Italia, but things got off to a bad start: after losing time on the opening team time trial, he lost more than a minute on the second stage because of a crash. On stage 3, the following day, things took a turn for the worse as he crashed head first on a descend with to go. Shortly afterwards, AG2R reported that he was in a stable state, even though he appeared to be bleeding heavily from his head region on television pictures. On the same night, he passed a CT scan which revealed no brain injury and talked to Gazzetta dello Sport: \u201cIt was a long night and I even made some plans for the future,\u201d said Pozzovivo. \u201cI was in the best condition of my life and I\u2019m thinking about returning at the Tour de Suisse and being competitive.\u201d Pozzovivo did return at the Tour de Suisse and registered second place on the queen stage of the race, a affair which finished at the foot of the Rettenbach glacier. He finished the event in fifth position in the general classification. He then participated in the National Road Race Championships where he came in sixth. ===2018=== On the mountainous Tour of the Alps, Pozzovivo took his first podium of the year, with a second place overall thanks to continuous top-10 placings during the stages. He pocketed the best climber jersey as well. The next Sunday, he got fifth at Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge. ===2019=== On 11 August 2019, Pozzovivo was severely injured after colliding with a car during a training ride. He was \"hit head on\" by the car and suffered fractures to his right leg, left arm, collarbone, and ribs. According to Cycling Weekly, it could be doubtful if Pozzovivo will return to racing, considering the severeness of his injuries. ==Career achievements== ===Major results=== ;2004 : 1st Stage 4 Giro del Friuli : 2nd Overall Giro della Valle d'Aosta : 2nd GP Citt\u00e0 di Felino : 3rd Overall Girobio : 3rd Gran Premio Palio del Recioto ;2007 : 3rd Overall Settimana Ciclistica Lombarda ;2008 : 3rd Overall Giro del Trentino : 9th Overall Giro d'Italia ;2009 : 1st Stage 5 Settimana Ciclistica Lombarda : 2nd Overall Brixia Tour : 3rd Overall Tour of Slovenia : 5th Overall Giro del Trentino : 6th Overall Settimana Ciclistica Internazionale Coppi-Bartali : 6th Coppa Sabatini : 7th Trofeo Melinda : 9th Overall Tour de Luxembourg : 9th Giro dell'Appennino ;2010 : 1st 20px Overall Brixia Tour ::1st Stages 2 & 4 : 2nd Giro dell'Appennino : 2nd Tre Valli Varesine : 3rd Giro della Romagna : 3rd Overall Giro del Trentino ::1st Stage 4 : 4th Coppa Sabatini : 5th Trofeo Melinda : 6th Coppa Sabatini : 6th Giro dell'Emilia : 7th Overall Tirreno\u2013Adriatico : 7th Giro del Piemonte : 8th Overall Giro di Sardegna ;2011 : 2nd Overall Brixia Tour ::1st Stage 4 : 2nd Tre Valli Varesine : 3rd Trofeo Melinda : 4th Overall Vuelta a Castilla y Le\u00f3n : 4th Overall Giro del Trentino : 5th Overall Settimana Ciclistica Lombarda : 6th Giro di Lombardia : 6th Giro di Toscana : 6th Gran Premio Nobili Rubinetterie : 7th Overall Tour de Langkawi : 8th Overall Giro di Padania : 8th Giro dell'Emilia : 10th Overall Settimana Ciclistica Internazionale Coppi-Bartali : 10th Coppa Sabatini ;2012 : 1st 20px Overall Giro del Trentino ::1st 20px Mountains classification ::1st Stage 3 : 1st Stage 1b (TTT) Giro di Padania : 2nd Overall Tour of Slovenia ::1st Stage 3 : 4th Giro dell'Emilia : 4th Gran Premio Citt\u00e0 di Camaiore : 4th Overall Giro di Padania : 5th Gran Premio Bruno Beghelli : 7th Trofeo Melinda : 7th Milano\u2013Torino : 8th Overall Giro d'Italia ::1st Stage 8 : 8th GP Industria & Artigianato : 10th Tre Valli Varesine ;2013 : 4th Milano\u2013Torino : 6th Overall Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a : 7th Overall Tour de Pologne : 7th Eschborn- Frankfurt City Loop : 9th Overall Tour of Oman : 9th Giro dell'Emilia : 10th Overall Giro d'Italia ;2014 : 2nd Overall Giro del Trentino : 5th Roma Maxima : 5th Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge : 5th Overall Giro d'Italia : 6th Overall Tour of Oman : 6th Overall Tirreno\u2013Adriatico : 8th Overall Volta a Catalunya : 10th Overall Tour de San Luis ;2015 : 3rd Overall Volta a Catalunya ::1st Stage 3 : 5th Overall Tour de Suisse : 6th Overall Tour Down Under : 7th Overall Giro del Trentino ::1st Stage 3 : 7th Milano\u2013Torino : 8th Overall Tirreno\u2013Adriatico : 8th Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge ;2016 : 7th Overall Tour Down Under : 7th Overall Giro del Trentino : 7th Tour du Doubs : 8th Overall Tour of Oman : 10th Overall Vuelta a Burgos ;2017 : 3rd Overall Tour of the Alps : 4th Overall Tour de Suisse ::1st Stage 6 : 6th Overall Giro d'Italia : 6th Overall Tour de Pologne : 6th Giro di Lombardia : 9th Overall Abu Dhabi Tour : 10th Overall Tirreno\u2013Adriatico ;2018 : 2nd Overall Tour of the Alps ::1st 20px Mountains classification : 3rd Road race, National Road Championships : 3rd Giro della Toscana : 5th Overall Giro d'Italia : 5th Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge : 6th Gran Premio di Lugano : 7th Milano\u2013Torino : 8th Giro di Lombardia : 9th Giro dell'Emilia ;2019 : 2nd Overall Tour of Oman : 7th Overall Tour de Suisse ===General classification results timeline=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |colspan=17 align=\"center\"|Grand Tour general classification results |- !
