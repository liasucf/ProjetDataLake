    "text": "\u03b3-Hydroxybutyraldehyde, also referred to as GHBAL, \u03b3-hydroxybutaldehyde or \u03b3-hydroxybutanal, is a chemical intermediate in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter \u03b3-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) from 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BD). Like 1,4-BD, it also behaves as a prodrug to GHB when taken exogenously. However, as with all aliphatic aldehydes, \u03b3-hydroxybutaldehyde is caustic and is strong-smelling and foul-tasting; thus, actual ingestion of this compound is likely to be unpleasant and result in severe nausea and vomiting. ==Metabolic pathway== Metabolic pathway of GHB. ==See also== * \u03b3-Butyrolactone * 3-Hydroxybutanal ==References== Category:Hydroxy aldehydes Category:GHB receptor agonists Category:GABAB receptor agonists Category:Prodrugs Category:Sedatives ",
