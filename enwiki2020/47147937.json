In many versions, it has been known throughout the Greek world since the Middle Ages. The name has been applied to many fortifications across the Greek world (cf. Kastro tis Orias). The ballad may originally have been based on the Sack of Amorium (838); the characteristics of the citadel of Amorium (near modern Emirda\u011f, Turkey) seem to be mentioned, especially in the version called \"To Kastro tis Marous\".Aikaterin\u0113 Christophilopoulou, Byzantine History, 1986, 2:249 ==Plot== A castle is besieged for many years. One of the besiegers, whose mother is Greek, disguises himself as a pregnant Greek woman who wants to give birth or as a monk who wants to take refuge. The lady of the castle (the \"fair maiden\") takes pity and orders the gate to be opened. The besiegers pour in and the trickster chases after her as his prize, but she throws herself off the ramparts and dies. ==Notes== Category:Byzantine literature Category:Ballads Category:Year of song unknown ",
