She was awarded the status of Fellow in the American Physical Society, after they were nominated by their Division of Computational Physics in 2008, for her pioneering first-principles computational studies of surfaces and interfaces, which made possible the interpretation of complex experiments, and successfully predicted the physical, and chemical properties of broad classes of materials, including materials for photovoltaic applications. == References == Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society Category:American Physical Society Category:21st-century physicists Category:21st-century American women scientists Category:American women physicists Category:Living people Category:Date of death missing Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
