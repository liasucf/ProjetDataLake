    "text": "Lawyers in Love is the seventh album by American singer-songwriter Jackson Browne, released in 1983 (see 1983 in music). It reached number 8 on the Billboard Pop album chart and number 30 on the Billboard 200. It was Browne's fourth straight Top 10 album and stayed on the charts for 33 weeks. Out of eight tracks, four were released as singles. The title song was a top-20 pop hit for Browne, and was accompanied by one of his first music videos released on MTV. == History == In the intervening years since 1980's Hold Out and the release of Lawyers in Love, Browne released the single \"Somebody's Baby\" which became his biggest commercial hit to date. In the track \"Downtown\", he ad-libs a line to the melody of the Petula Clark song of the same name at the end of the song. Lawyers in Love was the first album without David Lindley appearing since his first release, Jackson Browne. Replacing Lindley with guitarists Rick Vito and Danny Kortchmar gave this album a different sound. The album was certified as a gold record in 1983 and platinum in 2001 by the RIAA.RIAA Gold and Platinum award. Retrieved July 20, 2010 ==Recording== Co-producer and engineer Greg Ladanyi explained the album's unusual recording sessions: \"For this record, Jackson wanted to be downtown, where the people were. So we found a warehouse in downtown L.A., and just turned it into a studio. We set it up so that the band could play without the distractions of a normal studio because, for the most part, Jackson was writing the songs \u2013 in terms of the key changes and chord changes \u2013 based on what he was hearing when the band was playing. There was no 'Okay, it's take one or take two.' We kept the tape rolling just about all the time. And there are very few overdubs.\" ==Reception== Although \"Lawyers in Love\", \"Tender Is the Night\" and \"For a Rocker\" were successful singles, the album received a lukewarm reaction by critics. In his retrospective review for Allmusic, William Ruhlmann referred to Browne's often overlooked songcrafting, but wrote \"...the craft, and the familiar tightness of Browne's veteran studio/live band, couldn't hide the essentially retread nature of much of this material.\" Critic Robert Christgau called the album \"A satire on, celebration of, and lament for the upper-middle classmates an Orange County liberal knows like he knows his neighbor's backyard...\" Rolling Stone critic Christopher Connelly had a more positive response. In reviewing the album at the time of its release, Connelly felt that the record was \"a more nervy, intelligent LP than its predecessor\" and \"a welcome widening of perspective that allows Browne to escape, once and for all, the L.A. albatross that has hung around his neck.\" But he despised the \"wretched\" 5:20 of \"antinuke agitprop\" that is \"Say It Isn't True'\" for displaying the worst traits of the album: \"No quarrel here with the sentiments he's expressing, but to gravely intone, 'There always has been and always will be war,' over a 'Kum BaYa'-like coo of 'Say it isn't true' \u2014 surely, you say to yourself, he can't be that stupid.\" ==Track listing== All tracks composed by Browne except where noted: #\"Lawyers in Love\" \u2013 4:18 #\"On the Day\" \u2013 3:56 #\"Cut It Away\" \u2013 4:45 #\"Downtown\" \u2013 4:37 #\"Tender Is the Night\" (Browne, Danny Kortchmar, Russ Kunkel) \u2013 4:50 #\"Knock on Any Door\" (Browne, Craig Doerge, Kortchmar) \u2013 3:39 #\"Say It Isn't True\" \u2013 5:20 #\"For a Rocker\" \u2013 4:05 ==Personnel== * Jackson Browne \u2013 guitar, vocals * Craig Doerge \u2013 synthesizer, piano * Bob Glaub \u2013 bass guitar, Hammond organ (on \"Say It Isn't True\"), guitar (on \"Lawyers in Love\") * Doug Haywood \u2013 Hammond organ, backing vocals, bass guitar (on \"Say It Isn't True\") * Danny Kortchmar \u2013 arrangements * Russ Kunkel \u2013 drums * Bill Payne \u2013 Hammond organ (on \"On the Day\") * Rick Vito \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals ==Production== * Producers \u2013 Jackson Browne and Greg Ladanyi * Assistant Producer \u2013 Brian Reed * Engineers \u2013 Greg Ladanyi and James Geddes * Technical Engineer \u2013 Ed Wong * Mastered by Doug Sax and Mike Reese at The Mastering Lab (Los Angeles, CA). * Art Direction and Design \u2013 Dawn Patrol and Jimmy Wachtel * Artwork \u2013 Howard Carriker and Joe Sohms * Photography \u2013 Matti Klatt, Randee St. Nicholas and Joe Sohms. ==Charts== Album \u2013 Billboard (North America) {| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 width=\"550px\" !align=\"left\"|Year !align=\"left\"|Chart !align=\"left\"|Position |- |align=\"left\"|1983 |align=\"left\"|Pop Albums |align=\"left\"|8 |- |align=\"left\"|1983 |align=\"left\"|The Billboard 200 |align=\"left\"|30 |- |} Singles \u2013 Billboard (North America) {| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 width=\"550px\" !align=\"left\"|Year !align=\"left\"|Single !align=\"left\"|Chart !align=\"left\"|Position |- |align=\"left\"|1983 |align=\"left\"|\"Cut It Away\" |align=\"left\"|Mainstream Rock |align=\"left\"|37 |- |align=\"left\"|1983 |align=\"left\"|\"For A Rocker\" |align=\"left\"|Mainstream Rock |align=\"left\"|7 |- |align=\"left\"|1983 |align=\"left\"|\"Lawyers in Love\" |align=\"left\"|Adult Contemporary |align=\"left\"|24 |- |align=\"left\"|1983 |align=\"left\"|\"Lawyers In Love\" |align=\"left\"|Mainstream Rock |align=\"left\"|4 |- |align=\"left\"|1983 |align=\"left\"|\"Lawyers In Love\" |align=\"left\"|The Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"left\"|13 |- |align=\"left\"|1983 |align=\"left\"|\"Tender Is the Night\" |align=\"left\"|Adult Contemporary |align=\"left\"|24 |- |align=\"left\"|1983 |align=\"left\"|\"Tender Is the Night\" |align=\"left\"|Mainstream Rock |align=\"left\"|18 |- |align=\"left\"|1983 |align=\"left\"|\"Tender Is the Night\" |align=\"left\"|Pop Singles |align=\"left\"|25 |- |align=\"left\"|1983 |align=\"left\"|\"Tender Is the Night\" |align=\"left\"|The Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"left\"|25 |- |align=\"left\"|1984 |align=\"left\"|\"For a Rocker\" |align=\"left\"|The Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"left\"|45 |- |} == References == Category:Jackson Browne albums Category:1983 albums Category:Albums produced by Greg Ladanyi Category:Asylum Records albums Category:Albums with cover art by Jimmy Wachtel ",
