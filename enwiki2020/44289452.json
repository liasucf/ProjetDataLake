In 1990 Shulman and a group of her friends founded London's gay and lesbian synagogue, Beit Klal Yisrael, of which she became rabbi. In addition to her work there, since her ordination she worked at Finchley Reform Synagogue; initially part-time, then for some years as half-time Associate Rabbi, then part-time again.
