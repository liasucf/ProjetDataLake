It is a hill fort of the so-called castro culture. Rather than a single castle, it encompasses an entire fortified town or village. The place was inhabited from the second century BC to the second century AD. It flourished during the first century, at the beginning of Roman rule in Galicia. The ruins are located on a 473-metre-high hill, covering an area 384 m long and 314 m wide. Unlike the other hill forts of the area, there are many straight walls and fewer curving structures. == References == == External links == * El castro de San Cibrao de Las dispone de una gu\u00eda para divulgar su patrimonio arqueol\u00f3gico Category:Castro culture ",
