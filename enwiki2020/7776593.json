    "text": "The Missouri Governor's Cup was a trophy awarded to the winner of the football game between Missouri's two National Football League (NFL) teams. Originally played for between the Kansas City Chiefs and the St. Louis Cardinals, the last trophy in the original series was awarded in 1987 due to the Cardinals' move to the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area following the season. Beginning in 1996, the year after the St. Louis Rams relocated from Los Angeles, the Governor's Cup series was reinstated and was played from 1996\u20132015 in the preseason. The Rams would relocate back to Los Angeles in 2016. The trophy was also awarded to the winner of the interconference regular season matchups between the Chiefs and Rams. The local press occasionally referred to the game as The Battle of Missouri, The Show-Me State Showdown, or the I-70 Series. ==History== ===1968\u201388=== The contest began in 1968 when St. Louis had the football CardinalsDean, Rick.

Both the Rams and the Chiefs possessed the two most productive offenses in the NFL in the early 2000s, and the meetings often resulted in shootouts. Former Rams coach Dick Vermeil was hired by the Chiefs in 2001 after he had won Super Bowl XXXIV with the Rams with one of the NFL's most powerful offensive squads in history. Once the Chiefs created their own high-powered offense with the arrival of Vermeil, the rivalry became even more exciting. In often meaningless preseason games, the Chiefs and Rams gave all their energy to secure the Governor's Cup, their spot as the best offense in the league, and bragging rights for their respective city in Missouri. Dick Vermeil faced off against his old coaching buddies with the Rams - including his offensive coordinator of \"The Greatest Show on Turf\", Mike Martz, who succeeded Vermeil for the Rams head coaching job. ==St. Louis Cardinals vs. Kansas City Chiefs== ===All-Time pre-season results=== The Chiefs and Cardinals met every pre- season to determine the best NFL team in Missouri.
