In 1869 the family moved to Mount Gambier, where her father had, controversially, been appointed Clerk of Court. In 1873 her mother re-opened Winnold House school, near Christ Church, Mount Gambier, which had until a few years previous been operated by the Misses or a Miss Fickling. It also served as their home.In 1872 another \"Winnold House\" school was opened by the Misses Fickling at Port Elliot In 1878 the school was renamed Winnold House Ladies' College; its last year of advertised operation was 1886. Caroline, who had previously been home-educated, was at some stage enrolled at Winnold. She passed her first class certificate (later termed Intermediate) in May 1877, entered teachers training college 1879 and was appointed third assistant teacher at Port Adelaide in 1883, completed her second class (Leaving) that same year and was awarded her teachers certificate 1884. She studied physiology as a non-graduating student at the University in 1885 and won an Elder Prize for the subject. Prize was shared that year. Not the first woman student at the University: Edith Dornwell graduated at the same ceremony, and had received the Elder Prize two years earlier. She had taught at Winnold for a few years. Caroline was appointed to the Advanced School for Girls in 1885,Helen Jones, 'Jacob, Caroline (1861\u20131940)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/jacob-caroline-6816/text11795, published first in hardcopy 1983.

During the following year she had a new building constructed in Childers Street, followed by a home for boarders next door. Her sister Ann served as manager from c. 1900. :John Jacob lost his position in 1888 after 20 years' service; no reason was given and his valedictory in the Border Watch while describing him as \"urbane and straightforward\" fell far short of describing him as genial or sociable. His promised long service leave had without explanation been cut in half by the Government. He and Caroline had also served the (Anglican) Christ Church Sunday school for much of this time. After John Jacob's retirement he moved in with his daughter in Childers Street, North Adelaide. In December 1906 she took over Ellen Thornber's school at Unley Park, which she kept running as a separate entity for four or five years, closing in 1911.Barbara Wall A Short History of Stawell School: The forgotten school on Mount Lofty published for Mount Lofty Districts Historical Society by Peacock Publications 2012 Around the time of The Great War interest in private girls' schools declined, and Caroline wound down her schools, closing first Unley Park then Tormore (which became the \"Andover\" block of flats), and opening a smaller campus on Barton Terrace, North Adelaide. By December 1920 it was closed. Caroline occupied one of the \"Andover\" flats. ==Other interests== Caroline followed her family's dedication to the Anglican Church. In 1913 she was appointed to the board of Adelaide Diocesan Missionary Association. She worked for the Collegiate Schools Association. She founded the Headmistresses' Union, was active in the Kindergarten Union and its Training College, and was a member of the South Australian Advisory Council on Education. ==Family== John Jacob (30 July 1816 \u2013 28 August 1910) was born in Andover, Hampshire, and left for Australia on the barque Juliet around July 1837, arriving at Launceston in November and arriving in South Australia on the William in January 1838. In 1839 he drove cattle overland from Sydney to McLaren Vale where he established a station. He helped establish his brother's cattle run \"Moorooroo\" on Jacob's Creek (named for William), between the Lyndoch Valley and Tanunda, and settled at \"Woodlands\", near Penwortham. He was a friend of explorer John Ainsworth Horrocks (1818\u20131846), the town's founder; his sister Ann Jacob (c. 1824 \u2013 12 January 1874) married Arthur Horrocks ( \u2013 1872), brother of the explorer. He and William took out a lease of at Paralana, near Arkaroola in the north of the Colony, but their stock was mostly wiped out by drought in the mid-1960s and he returned to the Barossa and for a time worked as a land agent in Mintaro.
