    "text": "Ferenc Barlab\u00e1ssy de Alpar\u00e9t (; killed 1599) was a Hungarian nobleman in the second half of the 16th century, who was active in the Principality of Transylvania. He was a supporter of G\u00e1sp\u00e1r Bekes, a claimant to throne of Transylvania in the 1570s. ==Family== Ferenc (III) was born into a wealthy Transylvanian noble family as the son of Mih\u00e1ly IV Barlab\u00e1ssy (born 1515) and Katalin Tomori, daughter of Istv\u00e1n Tomori, the Vice-voivode of Transylvania from 1523 to 1526 and from 1528 to 1531, and niece of P\u00e1l Tomori, commander- in-chief of the Hungarian army in the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526, where he was killed. Mih\u00e1ly and his family lived in Alpar\u00e9t (present-day Bob\u00e2lna, Romania), where his ancestors erected a country-house. Ferenc was also born there around 1540. ==Career== After his father, Mih\u00e1ly died in 1555, Ferenc became the last offspring of the Barlab\u00e1ssy's senior branch, descending from his great- grandfather J\u00e1nos III. Therefore, he inherited large-scale landholdings throughout Transylvania, including Cs\u00edkfalva (V\u0103rgata) and Kutyfalva (Cuci). Ferenc Barlab\u00e1ssy supported the policy of John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya, King-elect of Hungary and later the first Prince of Transylvania. Under his influence, Barlab\u00e1ssy was one of those Transylvanian lords, who converted to Unitarianism from Roman Catholicism in the 1560s. John Sigismund died in 1571. The Transylvanian Diet elected the Roman Catholic lord, Stephen B\u00e1thory as his successor with the title of voivode. G\u00e1sp\u00e1r Bekes, also sponsored by Emperor Maximilian II contested the election. Barlab\u00e1ssy supported the claim of Bekes, a fellow Unitarian. Bekes gathered his army and organized a rebellion against B\u00e1thory. Barlab\u00e1ssy joined his army, leading the troops of the Sz\u00e9kelys of Marossz\u00e9k. In his letter to captain L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Rad\u00e1k in 1575, Bekes called Barlab\u00e1ssy as head of all Sz\u00e9kelys within his party. Ferenc Barlab\u00e1ssy was isolated in his family due to his political orientation. The members of the younger branch of his kinship, descending from Vice-voivode L\u00e9n\u00e1rd Barlab\u00e1ssy, were considered partisans of Stephen B\u00e1thory, primarily Farkas Barlab\u00e1ssy, who also owned estates in Sz\u00e9kely Land and participated in the civil war in B\u00e1thory's retinue. The decisive battle took place near Kerel\u0151szentp\u00e1l (S\u00e2npaul) on 9 July 1575, where G\u00e1sp\u00e1r Bekes was defeated. Barlab\u00e1ssy gathered his army and was en route to the battlefield, but missed the battle and arrived to the scene one day later. Supporters of Bekes were brutally suppressed and privileges for the Sz\u00e9kelys were suspended. Ferenc Barlab\u00e1ssy sought refuge in the castle of Szatm\u00e1r (Satu Mare). Along with 32 other lords, he was sentenced to death in absentia and his landholdings and villages were confiscated by a tribunal at the diet of Kolozsv\u00e1r (Cluj-Napoca) in August 1575. G\u00e1sp\u00e1r Bekes decided to reconcile with B\u00e1thory and became his loyal ally and close adviser, when the latter was elected monarch of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth in the spring of 1576. Among other pro-Bekes lords, Barlab\u00e1ssy was granted amnesty and he was able to recover his confiscated lands. He also swore loyalty to Stephen B\u00e1thory. Barlab\u00e1ssy remained a partisan of the B\u00e1thory family throughout his life but lost all political influence, retiring to his country-house at Alpar\u00e9t. He was also considered a partisan of Prince Sigismund B\u00e1thory. When Emperor Rudolf II's military commander Michael the Brave invaded Transylvania in 1599, the province was harassed from pillaging raids made by his unpaid soldiers, while Ottoman marauders made frequent incursions across the frontiers. Ferenc Barlab\u00e1ssy was slaughtered together with his unidentified wife and children, while the contry-house at Alpar\u00e9t was looted and destroyed. ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:1540s births Category:1599 deaths Category:16th- century Hungarian people Category:Hungarian Unitarians Category:Converts to Unitarianism from Catholicism Category:Hungarian murder victims Ferenc Category:People from Cluj County ",
