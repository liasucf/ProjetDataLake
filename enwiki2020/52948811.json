In the Asia/Oceania Zone there were four different tiers, called groups, in which teams competed against each other to advance to the upper tier. Winners in Group I advanced to the World Group Play-offs, along with losing teams from the World Group first round. Teams who lost their respective ties competed in the relegation play-offs, with winning teams remaining in Group I, whereas teams who lost their play-offs were relegated to the Asia/Oceania Zone Group II in 2018. ==Participating nations== Seeds: The first seed received a bye into the second round. # # Remaining nations: * * * * * ===Draw=== ==First round== ===Chinese Taipei vs. China=== ===South Korea vs. Uzbekistan=== ===India vs. New Zealand=== == Second round == ===Kazakhstan vs. China=== === India vs. Uzbekistan === == 1st round relegation play-offs == === New Zealand vs. South Korea === == 2nd round relegation play-offs == === South Korea vs. Chinese Taipei === ==References== ==External links== *Official Website Asia/Oceania Zone Group I Category:Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Zone ",
