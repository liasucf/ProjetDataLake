Two former high schools operated by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany, Vincentian Institute (VI) and Cardinal McCloskey High School, were merged in 1977, creating Bishop Maginn High School in the former McCloskey building. Declining enrollments and an aging Vincentian building made it necessary for the Diocese to use the newer McCloskey building for the new school. The first graduating class from Bishop Maginn was the Class of 1978. Formerly rivals, the students from both VI and McCloskey accepted each other in a harmonious display of unity, adopting an enthusiastic spirit for the new school. Each of the former schools' mascots, VI's lion and McCloskey's cardinal, were also merged to create the Maginn Griffin. The coat of arms for the new created school contains the line 'Veni Lumen Cordium', which in Latin means 'Come light of the heart'. In 2015, it was announced that due to declining enrollment and increased budget deficits, Bishop Maginn would move to the smaller, former Cathedral Academy building in downtown Albany. The school relocated to the former Cathedral Academy building for the 2015-2016 school year. Bishop Maginn's former building at 99 Slingerland St is now leased and home to Green Tech High Charter School. The school is noted for its Karen population from Myanmar, for which much of the baseball team are Karen refugees. ==Alma mater== In 1980, Anne Gould Penned composed An Ode to Bishop Maginn. It became Maginn's Alma Mater, and is sung annually by the graduating class at each commencement ceremony and by the members of the National Honors Society at their honorary ceremony. > Hail to our Blue and Gold! > Your Spirit will remain > Long after high school years have passed > And generations changed. > > The Griffins' pride and faith > Will ever be our guide, > With loyalty and fellowship > And service by our side > > Your blue will give us strength > Your gold will light our ways > Maginn - our Alma Mater > To you we sign our praise! > ==Notable alumni== *Talor Battle, basketball player who last played for Hapoel Tel Aviv of the Israeli League * Ernie Stautner, professional football player, coach and Pro Football Hall of Famer ==Notes and references== ==External links== *Bishop Maginn High School Category:1977 establishments in New York (state) Category:Education in Albany, New York Category:Educational institutions established in 1977 Category:Private high schools in Albany County, New York Category:Private schools in New York's Capital District Category:Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany Category:Catholic secondary schools in New York (state) Category:Organizations based in Albany, New York ",
