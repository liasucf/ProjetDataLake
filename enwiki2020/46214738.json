    "text": "A partial Voderberg tiling. Note that all of the colored tiles are congruent. The Voderberg tiling is a mathematical spiral tiling, invented in 1936 by mathematician Heinz Voderberg. It is a monohedral tiling, meaning that it consists of only one shape, tessellated with congruent copies of itself. In this case, the prototile is an elongated irregular nonagon, or nine-sided figure. Because it has no translational symmetries, the Voderberg tiling is technically non-periodic, even though it exhibits an obvious repeating pattern. This tiling was the first spiral tiling to be devised, preceding later work by Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum and Geoffrey C. Shephard in the 1970s. A Voderberg tiling is depicted on the cover of Gr\u00fcnbaum and Shephard's 1987 book Tilings and Patterns.. ==References== Category:Tessellation Category:Spirals ",
