    "text": "The Black Room is a 1982 American horror film directed by Elly Kenner and written and co-directed by Norman Thaddeus Vane. It stars Stephen Knight, Cassandra Gava, Jimmy Stathis and Clara Perryman, and features Christopher McDonald and Linnea Quigley in small, early roles. The plot concerns siblings who lure swingers to their Hollywood mansion, kill them, then - with long scenes of blood transfusions - drain their blood. Though there is no classical vampirism in the film\u2014in the sense of supernatural beings or blood drinking\u2014the plot's focus on draining blood to prolong life has led to many sources considering it a vampire film.John L. Flynn Cinematic vampires: the living dead on film and television, - 1992 \"1982 The Black Room Directors- Writers: Elly Kenner, Norman Thaddeus Vane. Starring Stephen Knight, Cassandra Gaviola, Jimmy Stathis, Clara Perryman. The Black Room (1982) has also been highly regarded in some critical quarters as the best contemporary vampire film.\" == Plot == Bored suburban husband and father Larry (Jimmy Stathis) surreptitiously rents a room in the Hollywood Hills mansion owned by Bridget (Cassandra Gava) and her brother Jason (Stephen Knight), who is suffering from a rare blood disorder which requires frequent transfusions. Larry uses his new rental property to bring various willing women for the purposes of sex, while Jason and Bridget watch through a secret peep hole. Unbeknownst to Larry, however, once he departs the scene, Bridget and Jason capture his sex partners and drain their blood in an effort to prolong Jason's life. Eventually, Larry's wife Robin (Clara Perryman) discovers his infidelity. While initially hurt and angry, she soon decides to rent the \"black room\" for her own sexual purposes. When Larry finds out his wife is also cheating on him, he becomes angry and jealous, arguing with her and finally agreeing to cease his illicit activities in exchange for her doing the same. Both partners agree to cease their activities in \"the black room.\" They soon discover, however, that Jason and Bridget have kidnapped their two children, and plan to drain their blood.

From its lingering shots of hypodermic needles and blood coursing through transfusion tubes into track-scarred arms to its fascination with voyeurism, promiscuity and gratification, it's definitely a film ahead of its time.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:1982 films ",
