    "text": "This article provides information on candidates who stood for the 1940 Australian federal election. The election was held on 21 September 1940. Earlier in 1940, the Lang Labor supporters had again broken away from the federal Australian Labor Party. Seats held by the defectors are designated as Labor seats. ==By-elections, appointments and defections== ===By-elections and appointments=== *On 12 July 1938, Jim Sheehan (Labor) was appointed a Victorian Senator to replace John Barnes (Labor). *On 10 December 1938, Sydney McHugh (Labor) was elected to succeed Charles Hawker (UAP) as the member for Wakefield. *On 20 May 1939, William Conelan (Labor) was elected to succeed Frank Baker (Labor) as the member for Griffith. *On 27 May 1939, Lancelot Spurr (Labor) was elected to succeed Joseph Lyons (UAP) as the member for Wilmot. *On 2 March 1940, John Dedman (Labor) was elected to succeed Richard Casey (UAP) as the member for Corio. *On 13 August 1940, three UAP cabinet ministers, Geoffrey Street (Corangamite), James Fairbairn (Flinders) and Sir Henry Gullett (Henty), were killed in the Canberra air disaster. No by- elections were held due to the proximity of the election. ===Defections=== *In 1937, Country Party MP John McEwen (Indi) was expelled from the state-based party for accepting a ministry in the Lyons-Page government. In response, following the party conference in 1938, Thomas Paterson (Gippsland) led over a hundred McEwen supporters out of the state United Country Party to form the breakaway Liberal Country Party, loyal to the Page-led federal party. The Country Party's other Victorian MP, George Rankin (Bendigo), remained with the UCP. *In 1938, Independent UAP MP Percy Spender (Warringah) joined the United Australia Party. *In 1940, supporters of New South Wales Premier Jack Lang again broke away from the federal Labor Party, this time calling themselves the Australian Labor Party (Non-Communist). Its federal members were Senator Stan Amour (New South Wales), Senator John Armstrong (New South Wales), Jack Beasley (West Sydney), Joe Gander (Reid), Dan Mulcahy (Lang), Sol Rosevear (Dalley) and Tom Sheehan (Cook). ==Retiring Members and Senators== ===Labor=== * William Maloney MP (Melbourne, Vic) ===United Australia=== *Senator Charles Grant (Tas) ===Country=== * James Hunter MP (Maranoa, Qld) ==House of Representatives== Sitting members at the time of the election are shown in bold text. Successful candidates are highlighted in the relevant colour. Where there is possible confusion, an asterisk (*) is also used. ===New South Wales=== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border:1px solid #aaa; border-collapse:collapse\" |- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\" !Electorate !Held by !Labor candidate !Coalition candidate !Labor (N-C) candidate !State Labor candidate !Other candidates |- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\" | || || | ||| ||| ||| ||bgcolor=\"#999999\"| |- |Barton || United Australia || |H.
