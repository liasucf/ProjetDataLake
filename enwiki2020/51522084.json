    "text": "Rumiyah () was an online magazine used by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) for propaganda and recruitment. It was first published in September 2016 and is released in several languages, including English, French, German, Russian, Indonesian and Uyghur. The magazine replaces Dabiq, Dar al-Islam and other magazines that were released until mid-2016. Analysts attributed the change of name partly to the imminent loss of the town of Dabiq to a Turkish-led military offensive, which occurred in October 2016. The name Rumiyah (Rome) is a reference to a hadith in which Muhammed said that Muslims would conquer both Constantinople and Rome in that order. Like Dabiq, each issue opens with a quote attributed to Abu Hamza al-Muhajir: \"O muwahhidin, rejoice, for by Allah, we will not rest from our jihad except beneath the olive trees of Rumiyah (Rome).\" The first issue was released after the death of ISIL's spokesman, Abu Mohammad al-Adnani, who was featured heavily in the magazine. In October 2016, Islamic State released the second edition of the magazine in which it justified attacks against non-Muslims, including detailed descriptions of how to carry out knife attacks on smaller groups of people. In October 2016, Rumiyah advised followers to carry out stabbing attacks and argued that jihadists throughout Muslim history have \"struck the necks of the kuffar\" (unbelievers) in the name of Allah with \"swords, severing limbs and piercing the fleshy meat of those who opposed Islam\". The magazine advised its readers that knives are easy to obtain and to hide and that they make good, deadly weapons where Muslims might be regarded with suspicion. ==Issues== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
