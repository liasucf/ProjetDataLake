His debut was bittersweet as it came the day after the death of Greg Page, an African-American defensive end who had arrived at UK alongside Northington. Page died from complications of a paralyzing spinal cord injury suffered in an August 22 practice. Northington only played for three minutes before suffering a separated shoulder, and the Wildcats would lose 26\u201313. ==Schedule== ==Footnotes== ==References== Kentucky Category:Kentucky Wildcats football seasons Kentucky Wildcats ",
