    "text": "Rivera () is the capital of Rivera Department of Uruguay. The border with Brazil joins it with the Brazilian city of Santana do Livramento, which is only a street away from it, at the north end of Route 5. Together, they form an urban area of around 200,000 inhabitants. As of the census of 2011, it is the sixth most populated city of Uruguay. ==History== Obelisk of the Plaza Internacional, at the \"Frontera de la Paz\", between the cities of Rivera (Uruguay) and Santana do Livramento (Brazil). On 21 March 1860 a pueblo (village) named Pereira was created by the Act of Ley N\u00ba 614. On 7 May 1862, it was substituted by the villa (town) named Ceballos and founded by the Act of Ley N\u00ba 704, in honour of the Spanish viceroy Pedro de Cevallos. In July 1867 it took on the official name Rivera and was recognized as a villa. The Brazilian town Santana do Livramento already existed just across the border. On 1 October 1884, it became capital of the Department of Rivera by the Act of Ley N\u00ba 1.757. Its status was elevated to ciudad (city) on 10 June 1912 by the Act of Ley N\u00ba 4.006. In 1943, the Plaza Internacional Rivera-Livramento (see photo) was built to celebrate the Fifth Conference of the Commission Mixta for Mixed Limits and as a hope for the future integration of the two towns, claimed to be the only international square in the world. From 1851 to this day, inhabitants of both communities are free to move in both sides. Today, duty-free shops are one of the main economic resources of Rivera. The first inhabitants of the city were Spaniards, Italians, Portuguese and some Brazilians immigrants who lived in Santana do Livramento, on the Brazilian side of the border. ==Border control== The two cities of Rivera (Uruguay) and Santana do Livramento (Brazil) maintain an open border without any physical border barriers or checkpoints. Inhabitants of the twin cities are free to move anywhere within the two communities without having to undergo checks. Travellers crossing the border here and proceeding further into the other country are required to complete border formalities at an integrated border control post located at Si\u00f1eriz Shopping in Rivera. The integrated border control post housing the immigration and customs offices of both countries was inaugurated on 28 December 2016. Previously, travellers had to visit various offices located in different parts of the twin cities. == Economy == One of the main economic activities of the city of Rivera is the free-shop stores, aimed at Brazilian neighbors, mainly coming from the cities of Rio Grande do Sul, near the border with Uruguay, making Rivera a popular destination for buying imported dollar products. With the fall in the price of the US currency, many devices can be bought for prices up to 40% smaller than similar ones sold in Brazil. The Rivera shopping limit is $300 per person. Purchases above this amount must be declared at the Federal Revenue Office for the payment of the corresponding import tax so that the product can legally enter Brazil. It is also worth mentioning the existence of a casino, located on one of the avenues where the border between the two countries runs. Within the department, livestock farming, agriculture and afforestation predominate. ==Population== In 2011, Rivera had a population of 64,465 {| class=\"wikitable\" !
