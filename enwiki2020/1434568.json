Her paternal grandmother was acting coach Betty Lou Bredemus (1934\u20132015), and her aunts are actresses Julia Roberts and Lisa Roberts Gillan. During her childhood, Roberts spent time on the sets of her aunt Julia's films. These experiences sparked a desire to follow her father and aunts into the film industry.

Roberts went on to appear in smaller roles in two family films: in 2002's Grand Champion, as the sister of the main character Buddy (Jacob Fisher); and in 2006's Spymate, as the kidnapped daughter of former secret agent Mike Muggins (Chris Potter), who tries to rescue her with the help of a spy monkey. Grand Champion had a brief theatrical release in August 2004, while Spymate was not released until February 2006, when it was given a theatrical run in Canada, followed by its DVD release in April 2006. In 2004, she began starring as the lead character Addie Singer in the Nickelodeon series Unfabulous, which debuted in September of that year. The sitcom earned Roberts several Teen Choice Award and Young Artist Award nominations. The series focused on a seventh grader, Addie, and her two best friends.

In 2008, Roberts starred as the lead in the film Wild Child, about a rebellious teen from Malibu, California sent to a boarding school in England.

I think when I am a little bit older it is definitely something I'd like to pursue.\" In another interview, she said: \"My musical career is indefinitely on hold. I don't like people who become like 'actor slash singer.' I think people should be one or the other because usually you're not going to be great at both. You're going to be better at one, so you might as well stick to the one you're good at. I'm going for acting.\" In February 2009, Roberts was named the brand ambassador for Neutrogena, appearing in print and television advertisements for the company.
