    "text": "Live in Paris is the first live album and video album by Canadian singer Diana Krall. It was released on October 1, 2002, by Verve Records. The album was recorded during Krall's sold-out concert at Paris's Olympia from November 29 to December 2, 2001, and includes songs from her albums Only Trust Your Heart, All for You: A Dedication to the Nat King Cole Trio, When I Look in Your Eyes, and The Look of Love. In the United States alone, the album has sold over 500,000 copies while the video has sold over 200,000 copies. The album won the 2003 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album and the 2003 Juno Award for Vocal Jazz Album of the Year. Billboard ranked the album at number eight on the magazine's Top Jazz Albums of the Decade. ==Reception== Christopher Loudon of JazzTimes wrote, \"I'm guessing that producer Tommy LiPuma, sage pulse-taker that he is, recognized it was high time for Krall to get back to basics. If so, 10 points for Tommy. Apart from the presence, on two of the album's 11 tracks, of the syrupy but subdued Orchestre Symphonique Europeen, Live in Paris features the British Columbia beauty stripped bare, passion fully exposed, intensity cranked to 11. Raw, unplugged, pure. Krall 101\". Nail Gader of The Absolute Sound stated, \"Surfaces are dead quiet, and the LP is lighter on its feet, more layered, airier, finer grained, and more transparent. Live in Paris is a great addition to a choice LP collection\". Jeff Cebulski of Paste commented, \"In the meantime, Krall croons blue notes heretofore reserved for Cassandra Wilson (in Joni Mitchell's 'A Case of You'), whispers wispy ballads, and even scats a bit\u2014a welcome return to her early form, before market-driven pressures took over\". ==Track listing== ===CD=== ===DVD & Blu- ray=== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of the Canadian edition of Live in Paris. ===Musicians=== * Diana Krall \u2013 vocals, piano ; Fender Rhodes * Anthony Wilson \u2013 guitar * John Clayton \u2013 bass * Jeff Hamilton \u2013 drums * Alan Broadbent \u2013 music direction, conducting * Orchestre Symphonique Europ\u00e9en \u2013 orchestra * John Pisano \u2013 acoustic guitar * Paulinho da Costa \u2013 percussion * Michael Brecker \u2013 tenor saxophone solo * Rob Mounsey \u2013 additional keyboards * Christian McBride \u2013 bass * Lewis Nash \u2013 drums * Luis Quintero \u2013 percussion * Ron Eschet\u00e9 \u2013 guitar ===Technical=== * Tommy LiPuma \u2013 production * Al Schmitt \u2013 recording, mixing * Steve Genewick \u2013 engineering assistance * Bill Smith \u2013 Pro Tools engineering * Aya Takemura \u2013 second engineer * Brian Montgomery \u2013 second engineer * Andy Sarroff \u2013 mix engineering * Jill Dell'Abate \u2013 production coordination * Doug Sax \u2013 mastering * Robert Hadley \u2013 mastering ===Artwork=== * Hollis King \u2013 art direction * Paul Lombardi \u2013 design * Rika Ichiki \u2013 design * Donna Ranieri \u2013 photography production * Bruce Weber \u2013 cover photography * Steve Lewis \u2013 back cover photography * Peter Rad \u2013 inside booklet and tray photography ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Album {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2002) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Jazz & Blues Albums (ARIA) | 2 |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| European Albums (Music & Media) | 23 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Japanese Albums (Oricon) | 83 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Swedish Jazz Albums (Sverigetopplistan) | 1 |- |- |- |- |- |} Video {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2002) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top Music Videos (Billboard) | 1 |} ===Year-end charts=== Album {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2002) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Jazz & Blues Albums (ARIA) | 6 |- ! scope=\"row\"| French Albums (SNEP) | 125 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top Jazz Albums (Billboard) | 3 |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2003) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Jazz & Blues Albums (ARIA) | 4 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top Jazz Albums (Billboard) | 2 |} {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2004) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top Jazz Albums (Billboard) | 4 |} ==Certifications== Album Video ==Notes== ==References== Category:2002 live albums Category:2002 video albums Category:Albums produced by Tommy LiPuma Category:Albums recorded at Avatar Studios Category:Diana Krall live albums Category:Eagle Rock Entertainment video albums Category:Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album Category:Juno Award for Vocal Jazz Album of the Year albums Category:Live video albums Category:Verve Records live albums ",
