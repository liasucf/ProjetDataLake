    "text": "Flowers in a Vase, 1830 Primula Henri\u00ebtte Geertruida Knip (19 July 1783 \u2013 29 May 1842) was a flower painter from the Northern Netherlands. Knip was born in Tilburg as the daughter of the painter Nicolaas Frederik Knip. After her father went blind, she followed lessons from her older brother, Joseph August Knip. In 1802, she followed him to Paris and took lessons from the flower painter Gerard van Spaendonck. She became a successful painter and spent summers in Haarlem painting the flowers of the various flower companies, and she spent winters in Amsterdam teaching ladies how to paint. In 1824 she went back again to Paris to take lessons from the artist Jan Frans van Dael. When her brother began to go blind, she was able to support his family as well as herself. She never married and died in Haarlem. Her work is sometimes confused with that of her niece Henri\u00ebtte Ronner-Knip, whose works generally contain animals. ==References== == External links == * Henri\u00ebtte Knip in the RKD * Henri\u00ebtte Knip in 1001 Vrouwen uit de Nederlandse geschiedenis Category:1783 births Category:1842 deaths Category:People from Tilburg Category:18th-century Dutch painters Category:19th-century Dutch painters Category:Flower artists Category:Botanical illustrators Category:Dutch women painters Category:19th- century women artists Category:18th-century women artists ",
