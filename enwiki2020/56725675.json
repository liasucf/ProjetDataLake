Its full title, the Grammaire \u00e9gyptienne ou Principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de l'\u00e9criture sacr\u00e9e \u00e9gyptienne appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation de la langue parl\u00e9e means Egyptian Grammar or General Principles of Egyptian Sacred Writing Applied to the Presentation of the Spoken Language. == Origins == Champollion began writing his Grammaire on his return from Egypt to France on 5 March 1830, it contains a number of drawings reproduced in Egypt, by Champollion himself and his assistants; but he died in 1832 without being able to publish it. It was his brother, Jacques-Joseph Champollion, who would handle its publication in 1836. Marcellin Jobard, a lithographer from Brussels, whom claimed to have advised Champollion the use of lithography for the printing of the Grammaire \u00e9gyptienne. The printing combines lithography and typography, with lithographic stone transfer methods improved by Jules Feuqui\u00e8res, used by 's lithographic workshop in Paris, which was responsible for the lithographic printing process of the Grammaire. Grammaire points out that the Egyptian hieroglyphs are a complex writing system combined logographic, syllabic and alphabetic elements in one text, one phrase or even one character. This work went hand in hand with the Dictionnaire \u00e9gyptien en \u00e9criture hi\u00e9roglyphique, another work by Champollion which was also published posthumously by his brother in 1841. The aim of Dictionnaire \u00e9gyptien was to create a complete method of learning hieroglyphic writing. \u00c9mile Prisse d'Avennes, a French archaeologist, who became an Egyptologist after studying Grammaire \u00e9gyptienne. == Hieroglyphics == Grammaire \u00e9gyptienne contains many hieroglyphs in a rather particular style.
