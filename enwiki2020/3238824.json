    "text": "Hyde Park is a suburb of Townsville in the City of Townsville, Queensland, Australia. == Geography == Hyde Park is north of Mysterton, west of Hermit Park, east of Pimlico, and south of West End, and its postcode is 4812. == History == As part of the development of Townsville, sugar plantations were established at Hyde Park in 1866. In 1918, Hyde Park was transferred from the Thuringowa Shire to the City of Townsville by a ballot. Most of the street names (and the suburb's name itself) come from London streets and suburbs - for example, Oxford Street, Bayswater Road and Park Lane. == Facilities == Hyde Park contains two shopping centres, Castletown Shoppingworld and the Hyde Park Centre located on Woolcock Street. Hyde Park is also home to the Mater Women's and Children's Hospital, formerly known as the Wesley Park Haven Hospital and before that as the Park Haven Private Hospital (est. 1937). In January 1999 the hospital was acquired by The Wesley Hospital, Brisbane on behalf of the Uniting Church in Queensland. In 2007 it was acquired by the Townsville Sisters of Mercy, and is run under the Mater Health Services North Queensland umbrella organisation. == Education == Hermit Park State School opened on 16 June 1924 (though it is actually located in Hyde Park). St Margaret Mary's College opened on 22 February 1963. ==References== ==External links== * University of Queensland: Queensland Places: Hyde Park Category:Townsville Category:Suburbs of Townsville ",
