    "text": "Dick Landy, nicknamed \"Dandy Dick\", was an American drag racer. In 1965, Landy's Dodge Coronet A/Factory Experimental (A/FX) entry, bought from Jack Chrisman, was one of the first to compete in what would later become the Funny Car class. Landy won the Street class at the Winternats in 1968, following with a win in Modified (Altered) there in 1969. At the 1970 Winternationals, he beat Herb McCandless' Plymouth Duster, when McCandless redlighted. Landy would reach a final round only once more, at the 1972 NHRA Summernationals at Englishtown, New Jersey; he would lose to Grumpy Jenkins. Landy died on January 11, 2007 at the age of 69. == Notes == Category:American racing drivers Category:Dragster drivers Category:2007 deaths Category:Year of birth missing ",
