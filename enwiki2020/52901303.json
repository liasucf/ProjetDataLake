    "text": "Mausoleum O. G. Khouw is a historic site and tourist attraction in Jakarta, Indonesia. It is the last resting place of Oen Giok Khouw (1874\u20131927), a prominent philanthropist and scion of the Khouw family of Tamboen at the turn of the century. His widow, Lim Sha Nio (1879\u20131957), was also later interred there. The building was designed in the Art Deco style by G. Racina, an Italian architect and contractor living in nineteenth-century Surabaya, Dutch East Indies. His company, Ai Marmi Italiani, also constructed the mausoleum. When the mausoleum was completed and unveiled in 1932, its astronomical cost of f 500,000 (around US$250,000 at the time; or US$4.5 million in today's money) caused a sensation among the press of colonial Indonesia and the Netherlands. One commentator noted that Khouw's mausoleum was considerably more expensive than the burial memorial of American billionaire, William Rockefeller (1841 \u2013 1922), in Sleepy Hollow, New York. After decades of neglect, the mausoleum attracted the attention of heritage lovers in Jakarta in recent years, who now maintain the site in good order. ==References== Category:Khouw family of Tamboen Category:Colonial architecture in Jakarta Category:Dutch Colonial architecture Category:Buildings and structures in Jakarta Category:Indonesian building and structure stubs Category:Art Deco architecture Category:Art Deco architecture in Indonesia ",
