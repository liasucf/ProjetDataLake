A total of 32 teams compete in the knockout stage. ==Round and draw dates== The schedule is as follows. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !Round !Draw date !First leg !Second leg |- |First round |27 July 2019 |20 August \u2013 24 September 2019 |30 August \u2013 3 October 2019 |- |Second round |5 October 2019 |23 October \u2013 8 November 2019 |4 November \u2013 16 December 2019 |- |Quarter-finals |rowspan=3|4 December 2019 |23 December 2019 \u2013 15 January 2020 |20 January \u2013 15 February 2020 |- |Semi-finals |16 February \u2013 16 March 2020 |15 March \u2013 5 April 2020 |- |Final |colspan=2|18 April 2020 at Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium, Rabat |} ==Format== Each tie in the knockout stage, apart from the final, is played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scores more goals on aggregate over the two legs advances to the next round. If the aggregate score is level, the away goals rule is applied, i.e. the team that scores more goals away from home over the two legs advances. If away goals are also equal, extra time won't be played and the winners are decided by a penalty shoot-out. ==Qualified teams== The knockout stage involves 32 teams: the 30 teams which enter the competition from this stage, and the two teams which qualify from the preliminary round. Teams were seeded based on their association rank in their respective region. {| class=wikitable |- !Pot !width=50%|Pot 1 !width=50%|Pot 2 |- !Teams |valign=top| * CS Constantine * MC Alger * Ismaily * Al-Ittihad Alexandria * Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya * Al-Shorta * Olympic Safi * Raja Casablanca * Wydad Casablanca * Al-Shabab * Al-Ittihad Jeddah * Al-Jaish * Esp\u00e9rance de Tunis * \u00c9toile du Sahel * Al-Jazira * Al-Wasl |valign=top| * JS Saoura * Al-Muharraq * Al-Riffa * Shabab Al-Ordon * Al-Arabi * Al-Kuwait * Al-Salmiya * Al-Ahed * Nejmeh * Al-Ahly Benghazi * FC Nouadhibou * Dhofar * Al-Nasr * Hilal Al-Quds * Al-Hilal * Al-Merrikh |} ==Bracket== ==First round== ===Summary=== |} Notes ===Matches=== Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya won 4\u20132 on aggregate. \\---- Shabab Al-Ordon won 3\u20131 on aggregate. \\---- FC Nouadhibou won 2\u20131 on aggregate. \\---- Wydad Casablanca won 3\u20131 on aggregate. \\---- Ismaily won 4\u20133 on aggregate. \\---- Al- Jazira won 4\u20131 on aggregate. \\---- Al-Wasl won 3\u20132 on aggregate. \\---- Al- Ittihad Alexandria won 3\u20130 on aggregate. \\---- Olympic Safi won 2\u20131 on aggregate. \\---- Esp\u00e9rance de Tunis won 3\u20131 on aggregate. \\---- MC Alger won 2\u20131 on aggregate. \\---- 3\u20133 on aggregate.
