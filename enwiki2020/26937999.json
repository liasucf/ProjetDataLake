    "text": "The United States Senate elections of 1900 and 1901 were elections in which the Democratic Party gained two seats in the United States Senate, and which corresponded with President William McKinley's landslide re-election. By the beginning of the next Congress, however, the Republicans gained five additional seats, giving them a ten-seat majority. As these elections were prior to ratification of the seventeenth amendment, Senators were chosen by state legislatures. == Results summary == Senate Party Division, 57th Congress (1901\u20131903) * Majority Party: Republican (53) * Minority Party: Democratic (28) * Other Parties: Populist (2); Silver Republican 3; Vacant 4 * Total Seats: 90 == Change in Senate composition == === Before the elections === At the beginning of 1900. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:800px\" |- | colspan=5 | | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | | SR | | SR | | S | | S | | P | | P | | P | | P | | P | | D |- | | SR | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | rowspan=3 | R | | V |- style=\"height:1em\" | colspan=8 style=\"text-align:right\"| Majority \u2192 | | V |- style=\"height:1em\" | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | V |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | colspan=5 | | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |} === Result of the general elections === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center; width:800px\" |- | colspan=5 | | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | | SR | | S | | S | | P | | P | | P | | P | | D | | D | | D |- | | SR | | SR | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | rowspan=3 | R | | V | | V |- style=\"height:1em\" | colspan=7 style=\"text-align:right\"| Majority \u2192 | rowspan=2 | V | | V |- style=\"height:1em\" | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | V |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | colspan=5 | | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |} === Beginning of the next Congress === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center; width:800px\" |- | colspan=5 | | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D | width=50px | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | | R | | R | | SR | | SR | | P | | P | | P | | D | | D | | D |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | rowspan=2 | R | rowspan=2 | V | rowspan=2 | V |- style=\"height:1em\" | colspan=7 style=\"text-align:right\"| Majority \u2192 |- style=\"height:1em\" | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | V | | V |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | colspan=5 | | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |} {| |- valign=top !

Former Senator Matthew Quay, who had left the Senate for nearly two years because of the political stalemate, was again elected by the Pennsylvania General Assembly to the United States Senate. Republican Matthew Quay was re-elected by the Pennsylvania General Assembly, consisting of the House of Representatives and the Senate, in the 1893 election. With Sen. Quay's term expiring on March 4, 1899, the General Assembly convened on January 18, 1899, to elect a Senator for the next term. Between January 18 and April 19, 1899, seventy-nine ballots were recorded in an attempt to elect a Senator. Instead, the legislature adjourned sine die without electing a Senator due to a dispute between Sen. Quay's political machine and an anti- Quay faction within the Republican Party, along with Democratic Party opposition. Sen. Quay's term expired on March 4, 1899. Since a Senator had not been elected for the successive term, the seat was vacated. At the time, Quay was under indictment for misuse of funds. He was acquitted, after which Governor William Stone appointed Quay to the vacated Senate seat (a power the Governor did not legally have until the ratification of the 17th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1913). The Senate refused to recognize Quay's appointment, and the seat remained vacant until a Senator could be officially elected (which would ultimately be Quay himself, after a nearly two-year hiatus). This incident, among others, would later be cited by supporters of the 17th Amendment, which mandated the direct election of U.S. Senators. The Pennsylvania General Assembly convened on January 15, 1901, for a special election to elect a Senator to serve out the remainder of the term that began on March 4, 1899. The results of the vote of both houses combined are as follows: |- style=\"background:#eee; text-align:right\" | colspan=3 | Totals | 254 | 100.00% |} == See also == * 1900 United States elections ** 1900 United States presidential election ** 1900 United States House of Representatives elections * 56th United States Congress * 57th United States Congress == Notes == == References == * Party Division in the Senate, 1789-Present, via Senate.gov * * * * ",
