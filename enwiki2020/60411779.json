    "text": "United States gubernatorial elections were held in 1907, in eight states. Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland and Mississippi held their gubernatorial elections in odd numbered years, every 4 years, preceding the United States presidential election year. New Jersey at this time held gubernatorial elections every 3 years, which it would abandon in 1949. Massachusetts and Rhode Island both elected its governors to a single-year term; this was the last time Rhode Island elected its governors to a single-year term, switching to two years from the 1912 election. Oklahoma held its first gubernatorial election on achieving statehood. == Results == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! State !! Incumbent !! Party !! Status !!
