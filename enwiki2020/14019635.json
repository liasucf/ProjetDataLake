When the yacht club first opened, it was located on the Burlington Canal (near the light station), along the beach strip that separates Burlington Bay from Lake Ontario. It later moved to the foot of Bay Street. Since its founding in 1888, RHYC has promoted local and international yacht racing. Its current general manager is Katrina Lewis. The original Letters Patent, dated 30 May 1891, identifies the purpose of the Club's founding: > \"To establish and maintain a Club as a Corporation having for its objects > the encouragement of Yacht building and Yacht sailing and racing on Ontario > waters by the name of \"The Royal Hamilton Yacht Club\" the said club have > been permitted by Us to assume the Style of 'Royal'...\"Penny, Harry L. > (1988). One Hundred Years and Still Sailing: a History of Hamilton Yachts, > Yachtsmen and Yachting, 1888 to 1988. Hamilton: D.G. Seldon Printing, p. 5. The unique climatic, geographic, and hydrographic qualities provided by Burlington Bay give The Club one of the longest sailing seasons in central Canada.

For nearly half a century, RHYC's Youth Sailing Program, and, more recently, its Graduate Program, have helped these young men and women develop the skills and attitudes they need to excel in international competition. The success of these is due largely to the work of dedicated volunteers from the RHYC sailing community. Recent awards won by young Hamilton sailors include the E. Aileen Clarke Youth Performance Ranking Trophy awarded to the highest-ranking Club in the 13 and Under Provincial Youth Regatta Series (2005, 2001), and the Unistrut Central Youth Performance Ranking Trophy for winning the 16 and under series in 1998.
