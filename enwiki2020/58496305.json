    "text": "Special Affairs Department (, Abbr.: JASA), was an defunct agency of the Malaysian previous ruling government under Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition in the Ministry of Communications and Multimedia. It began as Badan Hal Ehwal Khas (BHEK), a unit under the Ministry of Information established after the 1959 Malayan general election to maintain and protect the political, religion and government stability. In 1960 BHEK was upgraded and renamed as the Cawangan Hal Ehwal Khas (CHEK) under the purview of Jabatan Perkhidmatan Penerangan (Federal Government's Information Services). The government Cabinet meeting in March 2000 approved the formation of a new 'Department of Special Affairs' (Jabatan Hal Ehwal Khas, abbreviated JHEK) to be upgraded from CHEK. In 2004, its acronym JHEK was changed to JASA. It was formed initially aimed to explain the government initiatives and programmes before it was slowly deviated and turned into political propaganda machinery for BN especially those of United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) to attack the opposition. The JASA's controversial functions were questioned and alleged as inefficient government agency despite having 1046 staffs and huge expenditure of RM74 millions. Its Director General, Puad Zarkashi (2015\u20132018) was paid RM 20592.00 for monthly salary, much more than the minister salary of RM 14907.20 monthly. After the 2018 general election that saw the downfall of BN government, on 23 May 2018 new Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamad of the new Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition federal government announced that the JASA was among few government agencies and departments that to be abolished. Dr Mahathir said JASA was dissolved because it was riddled with too many political elements. JASA was completely dissolved on 15 October 2018 with its 300 civil servants absorbed into other departments and ministries, while its mostly political contract staff cut. ==References== ==External links== * Facebook JASA Category:Malaysian federal ministries, departments and agencies Category:Former Malaysian federal ministries, departments and agencies Category:Ministry of Communications and Multimedia (Malaysia) Category:Government agencies disestablished in 2018 Category:2018 disestablishments in Malaysia ",
