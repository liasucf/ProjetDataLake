The Waffenlauf (German, literally \"weapon run\", French course militaire) is a military running long-distance running competition which was very popular in Switzerland from the 1940s until the end of the 1980s. While the running distances may vary, the race needs to be completed in military combat uniform and a backpack. The backpack has a specified minimum weight. A military-issue rifle is included in the pack's weight. == History == The first Waffenlauf took place in 1916, during the First World War, and it was organized by the soccer club FC Zurich. In 1934, the Waffenlauf of Frauenfeld was created, which is run over the Marathon distance, on a course that features several kilometres of dirt roads as well as 520 m (1706 ft) of ascents. The Frauenfelder is still the most prestigious of the Waffenl\u00e4ufe. In some cases, the Waffenlauf also included a shooting competition. For example, at the Waffenlauf of Berne (1949-1959, 30 kilometers). the runners could deduct 12 minutes from their running time if they hit the target thrice. During the 2000s, many Waffenl\u00e4ufe were abolished, while others were newly created. In many cases, the organizers were forced to organize a parallel non-military running competition in order to keep the Waffenlauf feasible due to the dwindling numbers of participants. As of 2019, 10 Waffenl\u00e4ufe are taking place, with distances of . == Rules == As an example, the rules of the Frauenfeld Waffenlauf (version of 2012): *Clothing: The participants must wear a Swiss military uniform (blouse and trousers).
