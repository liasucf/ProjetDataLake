    "text": "The Negro National League (NNL) was one of the several Negro leagues which were established during the period in the United States in which organized baseball was segregated. == League history == === Founding === Rube Foster, 1924, NNL League President Led by Rube Foster, owner and manager of the Chicago American Giants, the NNL was established on February 13, 1920 by a coalition of team owners at a meeting in a Kansas City YMCA. The new league was the first African-American baseball circuit to achieve stability and last more than one season. At first the league operated mainly in midwestern cities, ranging from Kansas City in the west to Pittsburgh in the east; in 1924 it expanded into the south, adding franchises in Birmingham and Memphis. === Competition === The two most important east coast clubs, the Hilldale Club of Darby, Pennsylvania, and the Bacharach Giants of Atlantic City, were affiliated with the NNL as associate clubs from 1920 to 1922, but did not compete for the championship. In 1923 they and four other eastern teams formed the Eastern Colored League (ECL) and raided the NNL for many of its top players, including John Henry Lloyd, Biz Mackey, George Scales, George Carr, and Clint Thomas, and signing Oscar Charleston, and Reuben Currie in 1924. The war between the two leagues came to an end in 1924, when they agreed to respect each other's contracts and arranged for the Colored World Series between their champions. === Difficulties and demise === The NNL survived controversies over umpiring, scheduling, and what some perceived as league president Rube Foster's disproportionate influence and favoritism toward his own team. It also outlasted Foster's decline into mental illness in 1926, and its eastern rival, the ECL, which folded in early 1928. The NNL finally fell apart in 1931 under the economic stress of the Great Depression. === Legacy === The Negro American League, founded in 1937 and including several of the same teams that played in the original Negro National League, would eventually carry on as the western circuit of black baseball. A separate Negro National League was organized in 1933, but eventually became concentrated on the east coast. To distinguish between the two unrelated leagues, they are usually referred to as the first Negro National League (or NNL I) and the second Negro National League (or NNL II). == Negro National League franchises == :Annual final standings: 1920, 1921, 1922, 1923, 1924, 1925, 1926, 1927, 1928, 1929, 1930, 1931 * Chicago American Giants (1920\u20131931) \u2013 Known as the Chicago Columbia Giants in 1931. * Chicago Giants (1920\u20131921) * Cuban Stars (1920\u20131930) \u2013 Known as the Cincinnati Cubans in 1921. * Dayton Marcos (1920, 1926) * Detroit Stars (1920\u20131931) * Indianapolis ABCs (1920\u20131924, 1925\u20131926) \u2013 Dropped from league mid-season 1924 but returned the following season. * Kansas City Monarchs (1920\u20131931) * St. Louis Giants (1920\u20131921) \u2013 Replaced by St. Louis Stars in 1922, which was virtually the same team with new owners. ** St. Louis Stars (1922\u20131931) \u2013 Replaced the St. Louis Giants. * Columbus Buckeyes (1921) * Cleveland Tate Stars (1922\u20131923) \u2013 Dropped out mid-season 1923. ** Toledo Tigers (1923) \u2013 Mid-season replacement for Cleveland Tate Stars. * Pittsburgh Keystones (1922) * Milwaukee Bears (1923) * Birmingham Black Barons (1924\u20131925, 1927\u20131930) * Cleveland Browns (1924) * Memphis Red Sox (1924\u20131925, 1927\u20131930) \u2013 Mid-season replacement in 1924 for Indianapolis ABCs. * Cleveland Elites (1926) \u2013 Closely related to both Cleveland Hornets and Cleveland Tigers. * Cleveland Hornets (1927) \u2013 Closely related to both Cleveland Elites and Cleveland Tigers. * Cleveland Tigers (1928) \u2013 Closely related to both Cleveland Hornets and Cleveland Elites. * Nashville Elite Giants (1930) \u2013 Became Cleveland Cubs for 1931 season. ** Cleveland Cubs (1931) \u2013 Returned to Nashville in 1932 after NNL folded. * Indianapolis ABCs (2nd team) (1931) * Louisville White Sox (1931) === Member timeline === DateFormat = yyyy ImageSize = width:800 height:500 PlotArea = left:20 right:50 bottom:20 top:20 Colors = id:majorGridColor value:rgb(0.9,0.9,0.9) id:lineColor value:gray(0.6) id:nl1 value:gray(0.9) id:inactive value:gray(0.5) id:gold value:rgb(0.99,0.72,0.15) id:brown value:rgb(0.36,0.20,0.10) id:vegasgold value:rgb(0.80,0.72,0.49) id:green value:rgb(0, 0.51,0.28) id:darkgreen value:rgb(0, 0.20,0 ) id:orange value:rgb(1 ,0.39,0 ) id:redorange value:rgb(1 ,0.20,0 ) id:red value:rgb(0.80,0.01,0.07) id:red2 value:rgb(0.90,0.01,0.07) id:darkred value:rgb(0.50,0 ,0 ) id:iceblue value:rgb(0.20,0.60,0.80) id:lgray value:gray(0.1) id:gray value:gray(0.3) id:gray2 value:gray(0.5) id:sand value:rgb(0.94,0.89,0.77) id:navy value:rgb(0 ,0 ,0.30) id:teal value:rgb(0 ,0.65,0.65) id:teal2 value:rgb(0 ,0.45,0.45) Period = from:1920 till:1932 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy ScaleMajor = start:1920 increment:1 gridcolor:majorGridColor BarData = bar:CAG # Chicago American Giants bar:CHG # Chicago Giants bar:CSW # Cuban Stars (West) bar:DAY # Dayton Marcos bar:DET # Detroit Stars bar:IND # Indianapolis ABCs bar:KCM # Kansas City Monarchs bar:STL # St. Louis Stars bar:COL # Columbus Buckeyes bar:CTS # Cleveland Tate Stars bar:TOL # Toledo Tigers bar:PIT # Pittsburgh Keystones bar:MIL # Milwaukee Bears bar:BIR # Birmingham Black Barons bar:CLB # Cleveland Browns bar:MEM # Memphis Red Sox bar:CLE # Cleveland Elites bar:CLH # Cleveland Hornets bar:CLT # Cleveland Tigers bar:NAS # Nashville Elite Giants / Cleveland Cubs bar:IN2 # Indianapolis ABCs (II) bar:LOU # Louisville White Sox Define $Up = shift:(,1) Define $Left = anchor:from align:right shift:(-1,) Define $Right = anchor:till align:left shift:(2,) Define $Right2 = anchor:till align:right shift:(-25,) Define $Down = shift:(,-10) Define $UpLeft = anchor:from align:right shift:(-1,1) Define $UpLeft2 = anchor:from align:left shift:(-1,1) Define $UpRight2 = anchor:till align:right shift:(-1,1) Define $UpRight = anchor:till align:left shift:(2,1) Define $DownRight = anchor:till align:left shift:(2,-10) Define $DownLeft = anchor:from align:left shift:(2,-10) Define $UpUpRight = anchor:till align:left shift:(2,10) PlotData = color:inactive textcolor:black width:20 fontsize:S mark:(line,black) anchor:middle # other options are anchor:from anchor:till align:center # other options are align:left align:right shift:(0,-5) # Note on dates: A team's bar begins with the season that team played its first game, and ends with the season after that team played its last game.

League fell apart before season end. == League champions == === Pennant winners === From 1920 through 1924, the team in first place at the end of the season was declared the Pennant winner. Due to the unorthodox nature of the schedule (and little incentive to enforce it), some teams frequently played many more games than others did in any given season. This led to some disputed championships and two teams claiming the title. Generally, the team with the best winning percentage (with some minimum number of games played) was awarded the Pennant, but other times it was the team with the most victories. The \"games behind\" method of recording standings was uncommon in most black leagues. *1920 \u2013 Chicago American Giants *1921 \u2013 Chicago American Giants *1922 \u2013 Chicago American Giants *1923 \u2013 Kansas City Monarchs *1924 \u2013 Kansas City Monarchs\u2021 *1925 \u2013 Kansas City Monarchs\u2020\u2021 *1926 \u2013 Chicago American Giants\u2020\u2021 *1927 \u2013 Chicago American Giants\u2020\u2021 *1928 \u2013 St. Louis Stars\u2020 *1929 \u2013 Kansas City Monarchs\u2020 *1930 \u2013 St. Louis Stars\u2020 *1931 \u2013 St. Louis Stars\u2020 (season did not finish; Stars had best record among league members and were declared the champions,http://www.nlbpa.com/st__louis_stars.html though non-member Pittsburgh Crawfords disputed title) \u2020 \u2013 Pennant was decided via a split- season schedule with the winner of the first half of the season playing the winner of the second half of the season, unless one team won both halves. \u2021 \u2013 Pennant winner went on to play in the Colored World Series. === League play-offs === From 1925 through 1931, the NNL split the season into two halves. The winner of the first half played the winner of the second half for the league Pennant. As mentioned above, disputes also occurred in the split season finishes. *1925 \u2013 Kansas City Monarchs (first half champions) beat St. Louis Stars (second half champions), 5 games to 3 games *1926 \u2013 Chicago American Giants (2nd half) beat Kansas City Monarchs (1st half), 5 games to 4 games *1927 \u2013 Chicago American Giants (1st half) beat Birmingham Black Barons (2nd half), 4 games to 0 games *1928 \u2013 St. Louis Stars (1st half) beat Chicago American Giants (2nd half), 5 games to 4 games *1929 \u2013 Kansas City Monarchs (both first and second half champions) *1930 \u2013 St. Louis Stars (1st half) beat Detroit Stars (2nd half), 4 games to 3 games *1931 \u2013 St. Louis Stars (both first and second half champions) === Colored World Series === For the duration of the league, a Colored World Series took place four times, from 1924 through 1927. The NNL Pennant winner met the champion of the rival Eastern Colored League. Three out of the four years, the Negro National League team (below in bold) prevailed. *1924 \u2013 Kansas City Monarchs beat Hilldale Club, 5 games to 4 games (1 tie) *1925 \u2013 Hilldale Club beat Kansas City Monarchs, 5 games to 1 game *1926 \u2013 Chicago American Giants beat Atlantic City Bacharach Giants, 5 games to 4 games (2 ties) *1927 \u2013 Chicago American Giants beat Atlantic City Bacharach Giants, 5 games to 3 games (1 tie) == Notes == == References == * Category:Negro baseball leagues Category:Defunct baseball leagues in the United States Category:African-American sports history Category:Sports leagues established in 1920 Category:Sports leagues disestablished in 1931 Category:1920 establishments in the United States Category:1931 disestablishments in the United States ",
