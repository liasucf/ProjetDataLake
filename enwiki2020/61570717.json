Ciao grew up developing an interest in fashion, trying to recreate the designs she saw on TV and in magazines. She began using petals for illustration after wanting to preserve a red rose that was given to her. Her designs are mainly dresses, using natural form of each flower on her illustrations, so each piece has an element of realism as well as fantasy. She has created illustrations for companies such as Chanel, Christian Dior, and Fendi. ==References== == External links == * Grace Ciao official website Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:National University of Singapore alumni Category:Fashion illustrators Category:Watercolorists Category:Singaporean women illustrators ",
