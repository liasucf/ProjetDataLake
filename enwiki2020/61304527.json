    "text": "Dr. Natalie Matosin is an Australian scientist known for research into the causes of stress and its role in mental illness. Matosin's research has been published in academic journals, as well as on The Conversation. Matosin spoke at TEDx Hamburg in June 2017 and is a National Health and Medical Research Council CJ Martin Early Career Research Fellow. == Early life and education == Matosin was interested in science and curing the world of disease from an early age and went on to study a Bachelor of Medical Science at university. Matosin was awarded a PhD from the University of Wollongong in 2015 with a thesis \"Exploring mGluR5 dysregulation in schizophrenia: from gene to protein\" under the direction of Kelly A Newell. She went on to hold a postdoc position at UNSW. == Career and research == Matosin works at the University of Wollongong and the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Germany. The focus of Matosin's research has been on the physical and chemical clues that remain in brain tissue following the effects of stress over a lifetime. Matosin analyses postmortem brain samples in order to compare the brains of those diagnosed with PTSD or depression with the brains of healthy donors. Matosin was working in Germany during the arrival of large numbers of Syrian refugees, and her research now includes study into the impact of trauma on refugee populations in the Illawarra community, examining its impact on the body's physiology at a molecular level and its relationship to mental illness. ==Publication== Her most cited articles are: *Matosin, Natalie, Elisabeth Frank, Martin Enge, Jeremy S. Lum, and Kelly A. Newell \"Negativity towards negative results: a discussion of the disconnect between scientific worth and scientific culture.\" Disease Models & Mechanisms (2014) 7, 171-173 doi:10.1242/dmm.015123: (cited 114 times according to Google Scholar ) Google Scholar citation for Natalie Matosin.
