The NCAA stopped awarding the Tournament Most Outstanding Player with this tournament. The next tournament MOP would be awarded in 2009. ==Qualifying teams== The following teams qualified for the tournament. There were no automatic bids, however, conference tournament champions were given preferential consideration.

The tournament featured three rounds of play. In the Quarterfinals, two-game series where the first team to reach 3 points was declared a winner (2 points for winning a game, 1 point each for tying). If both teams ended up with 2 points after the first two games a 20-minute mini-game used to determine a winner. Mini-game scores are in italics. Beginning with the Semifinals all games became Single-game eliminations. The winning teams in the semifinals advanced to the National Championship Game with the losers playing in a Third Place game. The teams were seeded according to geographic proximity in the quarterfinals so the visiting team would have the shortest feasible distance to travel. ==Tournament Bracket== Note: * denotes overtime period(s) Note: Mini-games in italics ==Record by conference== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Conference !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|# of Bids !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Record !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Win % !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Frozen Four !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Championship Game !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Champions |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| ECAC West | 3 | 2\u20136\u20130 | | 1 | - | - |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| NCHA | 2 | 6\u20131\u20131 | | 2 | 2 | 1 |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| ECAC East | 1 | 3\u20131\u20130 | | 1 | - | - |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| MIAC | 1 | 0\u20131\u20131 | | - | - | - |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| Independent | 1 | 0\u20132\u20130 | | - | - | - |} ==References== * ==External links== *Division III Men's Ice Hockey Record Book Category:NCAA Division III ice hockey ",
