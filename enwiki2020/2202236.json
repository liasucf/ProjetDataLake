    "text": "Palatal Fricatives are a subset of the oral sound, Fricatives. They are called Palatal Fricatives, because friction is created by the tongue applying pressure to the hard palate behind the alveolar ridge. Air flows through the small spaces the tongue doesn't block to create this specific sound. Interestingly, in English, only words that come from different languages start with voiced palatal fricatives. A palatal fricative is a type of fricative consonant that is also a palatal consonant. The two main types of palatal fricatives are: * voiceless palatal fricative () * voiced palatal fricative () Palatal fricatives are rare phonemes, especially the voiced palatal fricative, but they occur somewhat more often as allophones. They may occur as allophones of velar fricatives in the vicinity of front vowels (as in German in the case of ), or as alternants (whether dialectal, emphatic, etc.) of palatal approximants (e.g. often appears as between vowels in Spanish, and at the beginning of words may appear as in English, as in \"hue\", \"huge\" or \"Hubert\"). == Features == Occurs in two different forms in IPA: # Voiced (vocal chords vibrate) and Voiceless (vocal chords do not vibrate) #* Place of Articulation: Palatal: the tongue presses on the hard palate behind the alveolar ridge #* Manner of Articulation: Fricative: air being forced through a small passageway #* IPA Examples: Voiced: [\u0283] and Voiceless: [\u0292] #* Oral Sounds: Air only exits through the mouth Category:Fricative consonants Category:Palatal consonants == Pronunciation == == References == # # ",
