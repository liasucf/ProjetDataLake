    "text": "The Life of the Mind: the philosophic pioneer, Socrates (ca.469\u2013399 B.C.) Intellectualism refers to related mental perspectives that emphasize the use, the development, and the exercise of the intellect; and also identifies the life of the mind of the intellectual person. (Definition) In the field of philosophy, \u201cintellectualism\u201d is synonymous with rationalism, knowledge derived from reason. (Oxford definition) Moreover, the term intellectualism can also have a socially negative connotation about a man or woman intellectual who gives \u201ctoo much attention to thinking\u201d (single-mindedness of purpose) and who shows an \u201cabsence of affection and feeling\u201d (emotional coldness). (Definition) ==Ancient moral intellectualism== The Greek philosopher Socrates (c. 470\u2013399 BC) proposed that intellectualism allows that \u201cone will do what is right or best just as soon as one truly understands what is right or best\u201d; that virtue is a purely intellectual matter, because virtue and knowledge are related qualities that a person accrues, possesses, and improves by dedication to reason. (Definition and note on Socrates) So defined, Socratic intellectualism was an important philosophic component of Stoicism in which the problematic consequences of such a perspective are \u201cSocratic paradoxes\u201d, such as there is no weakness of will \u2014 that no one knowingly does, or seeks to do, evil (moral wrong); that anyone who does, or seeks to do, moral wrong does so involuntarily; and that virtue is knowledge, that there are not many virtues, but that all virtues are one. Contemporary philosophers disagree that Socrates\u2019s conceptions of the knowledge of truth, and of ethical conduct, can be equated with modern, post\u2013Cartesian conceptions of knowledge and of rational intellectualism. As such, Michel Foucault demonstrated, with detailed historical study, that in Classical Antiquity (800 BC \u2013 AD 1000), \u201cknowing the truth\u201d is akin to \u201cspiritual knowledge\u201d, in the contemporarily understanding of the concept; hence, without exclusively concerning the rational intellect, spiritual knowledge is integral to the broader principle of \u201ccaring for the self\u201d. Typically, such care of the self- involved specific ascetic exercises meant to ensure that not only was knowledge of truth memorized, but learned, and then integrated to the self, in the course of transforming oneself into a good person. Therefore, to understand truth meant \u201cintellectual knowledge\u201d requiring one\u2019s integration to the (universal) truth, and authentically living it in one\u2019s speech, heart, and conduct. Achieving that difficult task required continual care of the self, but also meant being someone who embodies truth, and so can readily practice the Classical-era rhetorical device of parrhesia: \u201cto speak candidly, and to ask forgiveness for so speaking\u201d; and, by extension, practice the moral obligation to speak the truth for the common good, even at personal risk.Gros, Frederic (ed.)(2005) Michel Foucault: The Hermeneutics of the Subject, Lectures at the College de France 1981\u20131982. Picador: New York This ancient, Socratic moral philosophic perspective contradicts the contemporary understanding of truth and knowledge as rational undertakings. ==Medieval theological intellectualism== Medieval theological intellectualism is a doctrine of divine action, wherein the faculty of intellect precedes, and is superior to, the faculty of the will (voluntas intellectum sequitur). As such, Intellectualism is contrasted with voluntarism, which proposes the Will as superior to the intellect, and to the emotions; hence, the stance that \u201caccording to intellectualism, choices of the Will result from that which the intellect recognizes as good; the will, itself, is determined. For voluntarism, by contrast, it is the Will which identifies which objects are good, and the Will, itself, is indetermined\u201d. From that philosophical perspective and historical context, the Spanish Muslim polymath Averro\u00ebs (1126\u20131198) in the 12th century, the Italian Christian theologian Thomas Aquinas (1225\u20131274), and the German Christian theologian Meister Eckhart (1260\u20131327) in the 13th century, are recognised intellectualists.Jeremiah Hackett, A Companion to Meister Eckhart, BRILL, 2012, p. 410. ==See also== *Anti-intellectualism *Chinese intellectualism *Intellectual *Intellectual movements in Iran *Intelligentsia * *Sanism == References == Category:Abstraction Category:Academia Category:Academic terminology Category:Analytic philosophy Category:Age of Enlightenment Category:Aptitude Category:Concepts Category:Concepts in ancient Greek aesthetics Category:Concepts in ancient Greek epistemology Category:Concepts in ancient Greek ethics Category:Concepts in ancient Greek logic Category:Concepts in ancient Greek metaphysics Category:Concepts in ancient Greek philosophy of mathematics Category:Concepts in ancient Greek philosophy of mind Category:Concepts in aesthetics Category:Concepts in epistemology Category:Concepts in ethics Category:Concepts in logic Category:Concepts in metaphilosophy Category:Concepts in metaphysics Category:Concepts in the philosophy of mind Category:Concepts in the philosophy of science Category:Continental philosophy Category:Creativity Category:Critical thinking Category:Deductive reasoning Category:Empiricism Category:Epistemological theories Category:Epistemology Category:Giftedness Category:History of education Category:History of ideas Category:History of logic Category:History of philosophy Category:History of science Category:Intelligence Category:Intelligence quotient Category:Knowledge Category:Logic Category:Metaphilosophy Category:Metaphysical theories Category:Metaphysics Category:Metaphysics of mind Category:Mind Category:Nerd culture Category:Ontology Category:Philosophical logic Category:Philosophical concepts Category:Philosophical movements Category:Philosophical theories Category:Philosophy of culture Category:Philosophy of education Category:Philosophy of life Category:Philosophy of logic Category:Philosophy of mind Category:Philosophy of science Category:Rationalism Category:Reasoning Category:Scholars Category:Secularism Category:Skepticism Category:Skills Category:Socrates Category:Theories Category:Theory of mind Category:Thought ",
