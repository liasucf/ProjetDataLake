    "text": "Gl\u00f3r na nGael (, \"voice of the Gaels\") is an Irish-language ceanneagra\u00edocht or lead organisation funded by Foras na Gaeilge and tasked with promoting Irish in three sectors: the family, community development and in business. Gl\u00f3r na nGael was established as a competition between community groups in 1961, and among the founders were An tAthair Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 Fiaich and an tAthair P\u00e1draig \u00d3 Fiannachta, both members of Cumann na Sagart. The competition has grown over the years and now encompasses both community groups and third-level college groups as well as an international element (Global Gaeilge) and since 2014 a project with the GAA to promote Irish in GAA Clubs, called An Turas Teanga (the language journey). Gl\u00f3r na nGael is the Irish publisher of the game Scrabble, and in 2015 it also published the Irish-language version of Monopoly. ==External links== *Gl\u00f3r na nGael Category:Irish-language mass media ",
