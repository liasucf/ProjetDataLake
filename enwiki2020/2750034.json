    "text": "Johann Heinrich Samuel \"Marcel\" Sulzberger (1876\u20131941) was a Swiss composer, pianist and music author. ==Life== There are few certain dates concerning his life, since Sulzberger himself contributed to keeping some facts unclear (for example, his birth year). Sulzberger was born in Frankfurt of Swiss parents in 1876. In 1900 he studied at the university and conservatory in Z\u00fcrich, where he was in contact with Othmar Schoeck and Gabriel Faur\u00e9. He was recommended to pursue further studies in Paris with Charles Marie Widor and went there in 1906. He returned to Z\u00fcrich in 1911. Sulzberger was a close friend and great admirer of Ferruccio Busoni, who had emigrated to Switzerland during the World War I. It also seems certain that in 1917 Sulzberger participated - apparently without result - in an event at the Dada gallery in Z\u00fcrich, in which Hugo Ball and Tristan Tzara among others participated. ==Works== During his studies, the young francophile Sulzberger was influenced by Claude Debussy's music. He was one of the first Swiss composers who experimented with bitonal and tritonal music, rather than a single tonality. Others also see an echo of Faur\u00e9 and the style of the Second Viennese School in his music. Sulzberger's compositions were never well regarded by the Swiss critics of the time, since his style of composition was much before its time. * Lieder f\u00fcr Gesang und Klavier, from there \"An die Entfernte\" * Chanson d'\u00e9t\u00e9 * Cort\u00e8ge et f\u00eate f\u00fcr Klavier (lost) * Sonate f\u00fcr Violine und Klavier (1919), premiere in Paris (1924) ==Leavings== *In the Central Library of Z\u00fcrich, letters from e.g. Hugo Ball, Busoni, Debussy, Ernst von Dohn\u00e1nyi, Joseph Szigeti, Richard Strauss and Felix Weingartner that were left behind by Sulzberger are located.
