    "text": "Changin' the Game is the sixth album released by Luke. It was released on November 11, 1997 on the Island Black Music label in collaboration with Luke Records and featured production from Campbell, Rod XL, Lil' Jon and Louis \"Ugly\" Howard. Though the album was met with some positive reviews, the album was flop and remains Luke's lowest charting album, only making it to #49 on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums. However, the single \"Raise the Roof\" found great success peaking at #26 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the Hot Rap Singles. The song helped to popularize the arm gesture by the same name which involved repeatedly extending ones arms upwards with the palms of the hands also facing upwards. The song is also featured in the compilation album Jock Jams volume 4. == Track listing == # \"Intro\"- 1:05 # \"Freak\"- 5:27 (Featuring Aaron Hall) # \"Wanda Smith\"- :24 # \"Baby Girl\"- 4:10 # \"Sheryl Underwood\"- :16 # \"Like This, Like That\"- 3:51 # \"Sommore\"- :38 # \"Luke's Sheila\"- 4:30 # \"Sommore\"- :37 # \"Live at Freaknik\"- 3:35 # \"Raise the Roof\" - 3:30 # \"Marvin Dixon\"- :48 # \"Squirrel\"- 3:30 # \"Let's Ride\"- 3:29 # \"Guest List\"- 3:08 # \"Megamix\"- 5:49 # \"Shout Outs\"- 4:52 # \"Outro\"- 1:07 # \"Luke's Sheila\" [Remix]- 4:00 == References == Category:1997 albums Category:Luther Campbell albums Category:Luke Records albums ",
