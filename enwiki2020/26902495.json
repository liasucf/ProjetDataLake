Descended from Crete, he served at the Church of the Theotokos of Chrysopigi in Galata. In 1646 he was elected Metropolitan of Heraclea, and on 5 January 1668 he was elected Ecumenical Patriarch, succeeding Patriarch Clement. But because former Patriarch Parthenius was hostile towards him, he was forced to resign in March 1671 and to become a monk in the Nea Moni of Chios and after that in the Strofades Monastery in Zakynthos. In 1677 he went to Venice and became commissioner in the orthodox Church of Saint George which served the local Greek-speaking community, until 1679 when he died. ==Sources== *Ecumenical Patriarchate *\u039d\u03b5\u03ce\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u0395\u03b3\u03ba\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd \u039b\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd \u0397\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 Vol. 13, p. 172\\.
