    "text": "Sir Charles William Chadwick Oman, (12 January 1860 \u2013 23 June 1946) was a British military historian. His reconstructions of medieval battles from the fragmentary and distorted accounts left by chroniclers were pioneering. Occasionally his interpretations have been challenged, especially his widely copied thesis that British troops defeated their Napoleonic opponents by firepower alone . Paddy Griffith, among modern historians, claims that the British infantry's discipline and willingness to attack were equally important. ==Early life== Oman was born in Muzaffarpur district, India, the son of a British planter, and was educated at Winchester College and at Oxford University, where he studied under William Stubbs. Here, he was invited to become a founding member of the Stubbs Society, which was under the patronage of Oman's don. ==Career== In 1881 he was elected to a Prize Fellowship at All Souls College, where he remained for the rest of his academic career. He was elected the Chichele Professor of Modern History at Oxford in 1905, in succession to Montagu Burrows. He was also elected to the FBA that year, and served as President of the Royal Historical Society (1917\u20131921), the Numismatic Society and the Royal Archaeological Institute. Oman's academic career was interrupted by the First World War, during which he was employed by the government's Press Bureau and the Foreign Office. Oman was the Conservative Member of Parliament for the University of Oxford constituency from 1919 to 1935, and was knighted KBE in the 1920 civilian war honours list. ==Honours== He became an honorary fellow of New College in 1936, and received the honorary degrees of DCL (Oxford, 1926) and LL.D (Edinburgh, 1911 and Cambridge, 1927). He was awarded the Medal of the Royal Numismatic Society in 1928. He died at Oxford aged 86. ==Children== Two of Oman's children became authors. His daughter Carola Oman CBE was a writer of history, biography, and fiction for adults and children, including a retelling of the Robin Hood legend and biographies of Admiral Lord Nelson and Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore. His son Charles C. Oman wrote several volumes on British silverware and similar houseware, worked as a Keeper of the Department of Metalwork in the Victoria and Albert Museum, and was active in the Folklore Society * * (and was in turn father to Julia Trevelyan Oman). == Works == ===1880s=== * The Art of War in the Middle Ages (1885) * \"The Anglo-Norman and Angevin Administrative System (1100\u20131265)\", in Essays Introductory to the Study of English Constitutional History (1887) * A History of Greece From the Earliest Times to the Death of Alexander the Great (1888; 7th ed., 1900; 8th ed., rev., 1905) ===1890s=== * Warwick the Kingmaker (1891) * The Story of the Byzantine Empire (1892) * The Dark Ages 476\u2013918, Period I of Periods of European History (1893; 5th ed. 1905) * A History of England (1895; 2nd ed. 1919) * A History of the Art of War in the Middle Ages, Vol. I: A.D. 378\u20131278 (1898; 2nd ed. 1924) * A History of the Art of War in the Middle Ages, Vol. II: A.D. 1278\u20131485 (1898; 2nd ed. 1924) * England and the Hundred Years War, 1327\u20131485 A.D.
