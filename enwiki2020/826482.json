    "text": "Dead Ringers is a 1988 Canadian-American psychological thriller film starring Jeremy Irons in a dual role as identical twin gynecologists. David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcus' story. The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time. ==Plot== Elliot and Beverly Mantle are twins and gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in the treatment of female fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly, while the women remain unaware of the substitution. An actress, Claire Niveau, comes to the clinic for her infertility. It turns out that Claire has a \"trifurcated cervix\", which means she probably will not be able to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. However, Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs, which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a bar, but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film. This sends Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse, and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. But before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board. With their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to \"synchronize\" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he is concerned about his brother, and goes back to the clinic. There he finds the clinic in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed, so as to \u201cseparate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room. The next morning, Beverly awakens, and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic, and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks, \"Who is this?\", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic, and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms. ==Cast== ==Production== Jeremy Irons played the two roles of Bev and Elliot Mantle. Although Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later. In his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film. Irons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. However, given the fact that he said \"the whole point of the story is you should sometimes be confused as to which is which\", he chose to use only one of the rooms and combine different costume items intended for different characters. Irons also developed an \"internal way\" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for \"different energy points\", giving each character his own appearance. A second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly's stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut. ==Reboot as TV series== On August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. ==Reception== On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 40 reviews, and an average rating of 7.64/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\". For the same paper, Rita Kempley called it \"every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller\", adding it was \"like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious\". It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of \"100 Maverick Movies\". Total Film placed Dead Ringers 35th on their list of the \"50 Greatest Horror Movies of All Time\" while Entertainment Weekly placed it 20th on their list of \"The 25 scariest movies of all time\". It was named one of \"The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!\" by Bloody Disgusting. In 1993, the Toronto International Film Festival Group compiled a Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time list, with festival director Piers Handling writing a lack of Cronenberg films was significant, and that Dead Ringers and Videodrome divided voters, causing neither to win a place on the list. Dead Ringers afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update, and seventh in 2015. ===Accolades=== Irons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech. {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Award ! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony ! scope=\"col\"| Category ! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| Chicago Film Critics Association | rowspan=\"1\" | 1989 | Best Actor | Jeremy Irons | | rowspan=\"1\" | |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=12| Genie Awards | rowspan=\"12\" | 22 March 1989 | Best Motion Picture | David Cronenberg and Marc Boyman | | rowspan=\"12\" | |- | Best Direction | David Cronenberg | |- | Best Adapted Screenplay | David Cronenberg and Norman Snider | |- | Best Actor | Jeremy Irons | |- | Best Actress | Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold | |- | Best Editing | Ronald Sanders | |- | Best Art Direction | Carol Spier | |- | Best Cinematography | Peter Suschitzky | |- | Best Costume Design | Denise Cronenberg | |- | Best Score | Howard Shore | |- | Best Sound | Bryan Day, Andy Nelson and Don White | |- | Best Sound Editing | Terry Burke, Richard Cadger, Wayne Griffin, David Evans and David Giammarco | |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=2| Los Angeles Film Critics Association | rowspan=\"2\" | 24 January 1989 | Best Director | David Cronenberg | | rowspan=\"2\" | |- | Best Supporting Actress | Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold | |- ! scope=\"row\"| National Society of Film Critics | rowspan=\"1\" | 9 January 1989 | Best Screenplay | rowspan=\"2\" | David Cronenberg | | rowspan=\"1\" | |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=2| New York Film Critics Circle | rowspan=\"2\" | 15 January 1989 | Best Film | | rowspan=\"2\" | |- | Best Actor | Jeremy Irons | |- |} ==See also== * Look-alike ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Dead Ringers an essay by Chris Rodley at the Criterion Collection Category:1988 films Category:1988 horror films Category:1980s psychological thriller films Category:1980s thriller drama films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American films Category:American horror thriller films Category:American psychological drama films Category:American psychological horror films Category:American psychological thriller films Category:American thriller drama films Category:Canadian body horror films Category:Canadian psychological drama films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian horror thriller films Category:Canadian psychological thriller films Category:English-language films Category:Films about sexuality Category:Films about twin brothers Category:Films directed by David Cronenberg Category:Films scored by Howard Shore Category:Films set in Toronto Category:Films shot in Toronto Category:Horror drama films Category:Best Picture Genie and Canadian Screen Award winners Category:Gynaecology Category:Medical-themed films Category:Morgan Creek Productions films Category:1988 drama films ",
