    "text": "In electrical engineering, the alpha-beta (\\alpha\\beta\\gamma) transformation (also known as the Clarke transformation) is a mathematical transformation employed to simplify the analysis of three-phase circuits. Conceptually it is similar to the dq0 transformation. One very useful application of the \\alpha\\beta\\gamma transformation is the generation of the reference signal used for space vector modulation control of three-phase inverters. ==Definition== The \\alpha\\beta\\gamma transform applied to three-phase currents, as used by Edith Clarke, is :i_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}(t) = Ti_{abc}(t) = \\frac{2}{3}\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -\\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\\ 0 & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\\\ \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}i_a(t)\\\\\\i_b(t)\\\\\\i_c(t)\\end{bmatrix} where i_{abc}(t) is a generic three-phase current sequence and i_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}(t) is the corresponding current sequence given by the transformation T. The inverse transform is: :i_{abc}(t) = T^{-1}i_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1\\\\\\ -\\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & 1\\\\\\ -\\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & 1\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}i_\\alpha(t)\\\\\\i_\\beta(t)\\\\\\i_\\gamma(t)\\end{bmatrix}. The above Clarke's transformation preserves the amplitude of the electrical variables which it is applied to. Indeed, consider a three-phase symmetric, direct, current sequence : \\begin{align} i_a(t)=&\\sqrt{2}I\\cos\\theta(t),\\\\\\ i_b(t)=&\\sqrt{2}I\\cos\\left(\\theta(t)-\\frac23\\pi\\right),\\\\\\ i_c(t)=&\\sqrt{2}I\\cos\\left(\\theta(t)+\\frac23\\pi\\right), \\end{align} where I is the RMS of i_a(t), i_b(t), i_c(t) and \\theta(t) is the generic time-varying angle that can also be set to \\omega t without loss of generality. Then, by applying T to the current sequence, it results : \\begin{align} i_{\\alpha}=&\\sqrt2 I\\cos\\theta(t),\\\\\\ i_{\\beta}=&\\sqrt2 I\\sin\\theta(t),\\\\\\ i_{\\gamma}=&0, \\end{align} where the last equation holds since we have considered balanced currents. As it is shown in the above, the amplitudes of the currents in the \\alpha\\beta\\gamma reference frame are the same of that in the natural reference frame. === Power invariant transformation === The active and reactive powers computed in the Clarke's domain with the transformation shown above are not the same of those computed in the standard reference frame. This happens because T is not unitary. In order to preserve the active and reactive powers one has, instead, to consider :i_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}(t) = Ti_{abc}(t) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -\\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\\ 0 & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt2} \\\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}i_a(t)\\\\\\i_b(t)\\\\\\i_c(t)\\end{bmatrix}, which is a unitary matrix and the inverse coincides with its transpose. In this case the amplitudes of the transformed currents are not the same of those in the standard reference frame, that is : \\begin{align} i_{\\alpha}=&\\sqrt3 I\\cos\\theta(t),\\\\\\ i_{\\beta}=&\\sqrt3 I\\sin\\theta(t),\\\\\\ i_{\\gamma}=&0\\. \\end{align} Finally, the inverse transformation in this case is : i_{abc}(t) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\\ -\\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\\ -\\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}i_\\alpha(t)\\\\\\i_\\beta(t)\\\\\\i_\\gamma(t)\\end{bmatrix}. === Simplified transformation === Since in a balanced system i_a(t)+i_b(t)+i_c(t)=0 and thus i_\\gamma(t)=0 one can also consider the simplified transformF.

Shown above is the \\alpha\\beta\\gamma transform as applied to three symmetrical currents flowing through three windings separated by 120 physical degrees. The three phase currents lag their corresponding phase voltages by \\delta. The \\alpha-\\beta axis is shown with the \\alpha axis aligned with phase 'A'. The current vector I_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma} rotates with angular velocity \\omega. There is no \\gamma component since the currents are balanced. ===dq0 transform=== The dq0 transform is conceptually similar to the \\alpha\\beta\\gamma transform. Whereas the dq0 transform is the projection of the phase quantities onto a rotating two-axis reference frame, the \\alpha\\beta\\gamma transform can be thought of as the projection of the phase quantities onto a stationary two-axis reference frame. ==See also== * Symmetrical components * Y-\u0394 transform * Field-oriented control ==References== Category:Electrical engineering Category:Three-phase AC power ; General references * C.J.
