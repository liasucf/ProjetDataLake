    "text": "Malm\u00f6 City Theatre () in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, is the main theatre of Malm\u00f6. == History == The first theatre in Malm\u00f6, Malm\u00f6 Teater, was built in 1808 but became out of use in 1938. The Malm\u00f6 City Theatre was built by the architect Sigurd Lewerentz between 1932 and 1944. From its opening in 1944 and until 1992 it was one of Sweden's leading city theatres. From the 1950s it was run by director Ingmar Bergman who staged a number of memorable and important productions with an ensemble which included popular \"Bergman-actors\" such as Bibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson, Gunnel Lindblom, Max von Sydow, Naima Wifstrand, Gertrud Fridh and Ingrid Thulin. In 1992 the theatre was reorganized as Malm\u00f6 Musik och Teater AB, and finally in 1994 split in four independent companies: Malm\u00f6 Dramatiska Teater AB (Malm\u00f6 Dramatic Theatre), Malm\u00f6 symfoniorkester AB (Malm\u00f6 Symphony Orchestra), Sk\u00e5nes Dansteater AB (Sk\u00e5ne Dance Theatre) and Malm\u00f6 Musikteater AB (Malm\u00f6 Music Theatre). While the first three of the group of four moved to other performance spaces, only the Malm\u00f6 Music Theatre remained in the building. By the end of the 1990s it was renamed in its present form - the Malm\u00f6 Opera and Music Theatre - and the stage is nowadays used solely as an opera house. ==External links== * Malm\u00f6 Opera and Music Theatre (official site) *History of the old Malm\u00f6 City Theatre at IngmarBergman.se Category:Former theatres in Sweden Category:Organizations based in Malm\u00f6 da:Malm\u00f8 Opera og Musikteater de:Musiktheater Malm\u00f6 sv:Malm\u00f6 opera och musikteater ",
