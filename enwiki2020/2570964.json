    "text": "Justiniana Prima (Latin: , / Justinijana Prima) was a Byzantine city that existed from 535 to 615, and currently an archaeological site, known as or Cari\u010din Grad (), near modern Lebane in southern Serbia. It was founded by Emperor Justinian I (527-565) and served as the metropolitan seat of the Archbishopric of Justiniana Prima, that had jurisdiction over the provinces of the Diocese of Dacia. In 1979, archaeological site of Justiniana Prima (Cari\u010din Grad) was added to the Archaeological Sites of Exceptional Importance-list, protected by Republic of Serbia. ==Background== The establishment of the Archbishopric is mentioned in Justinian's own Novel XI from 535, when he promotes the Metropolitan to an Archbishop, independent from the Archbishop of Thessalonica. The establishment is seen as part of the feud between Justinian and the Archbishop of Eastern Illyricum, who was a papal vicar.p. 100, excerpts from his novella ==History== Aeroimage in 1937. Photo archive of the Military Geographical Institute of Serbia The Military Geographical Institute of Serbia The city was founded by Emperor Justinian I. It existed from the 530s to 615 and was designed as a splendid bishop's seat. The city was a completely new foundation in honour of the nearby village of Tauresium, the birthplace of Justinian. According to Procopius Bederiana, the birthplace of Justinian's uncle and mentor Justin I was nearby. There has been a long debate about the identification of these historical places. The huge correlation between the archaeological site and the description by Procopius as well as finds of seals of the bishop of Iustiniana Prima are strong arguments for an identification of Justiniana Prima with Cari\u010din Grad.V.

Belgrade, 22\u201327 August 2016 : plenary papers (Belgrade 2016) 107\u2013126 The city planning combined classical and Christian elements: thermae, a forum, and streets with colonnades. Typical Mediterranean features went along with numerous churches. Justinian himself ordered the foundation of the city by law in 535, establishing the Archbishopric of Justiniana Prima, making it at the same time the capital of the prefecture of Illyricum instead of Thessaloniki (although this is disputed among historians). It also was chosen as the seat of the Dacian diocese. Thessaloniki, however, did not actually lose much of its administrative functions during the short lifetime of Justiniana Prima. Still, the new foundation was not without importance and Justinian made sure that this city, which was one of his favourite projects, received all the necessary support. In 545 Justinian issued another law underlining the episcopal rights and status of Justiniana Prima, which is also confirmed by letters that were exchanged between Justinian and Pope Gregory I at the end of the 6th century. :\"He therefore built a wall of small compass about this place in the form of a square, placing a tower at each corner, and caused it to be called, as it actually is, Tetrapyrgia. And close by this place he built a very notable city which he named Justiniana Prima, thus paying a debt of gratitude to the home that fostered him. In that place also he constructed an aqueduct and so caused the city to be abundantly supplied with ever-running water. And many other enterprises were carried out by the founder of this city - works of great size and worthy of especial note. For to enumerate the churches is not easy, and it is impossible to tell in words of the lodgings for magistrates, the great stoas, the fine marketplaces, the fountains, the streets, the baths, the shops. In brief, the city is both great and populous and blessed in every way.\" :Procopius' description of Justiniana Prima in The Buildings. The town was abandoned at around 615. Invading Avars coming from north of the Danube may be one factor, missing political interest in the town after the time of Justinian may be another. Among many other imported finds the presence of 2 pieces of a specific type of fibulae\u041c\u0430\u043d\u043e-\u0417\u0438\u0441\u0438 1955: 168\u2013170; 1957: 313 and handmade pottery have been understood as an indication of the presence of Slavs already before the Avar incursion.Jankovi\u0107 ==Archaeological site== There have been archaeological excavations for nearly 100 years with the participation of French and more recently also German researchers. There is a permanent exhibition in the national museum in Leskovac. At the site itself monuments there are impressive remains of the fortification, the acropolis as well as of several churches and many other buildings. ==See also== * Archbishopric of Justiniana Prima * Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum * Archaeological Sites of Exceptional Importance (Serbia) ==References== ==Sources== * William Bowden (2003), \"Theory and practice in late antique archaeology\", pp. 207\u2013220, BRILL. * * * * * * * * * Vujadin Ivani\u0161evi\u0107, Cari\u010din Grad / Justiniana Prima (Serbia) \u2013 excavations in a Byzantine city of the 6th century A.D. * * * * * * * * * * * * == External links == * Cari\u010din Grad \u2013 Iustiniana Prima, archaeological site - UNESCO * 3-D animation Justiniana Prima * Justiniana Prima on YouTube * Zooarchaeology: Bones of Camel Discovered at site of Cari\u010din Grad - Justiniana Prima (In Serbian) on YouTube Category:Populated places established in the 6th century Category:Byzantine Serbia Category:Byzantine sites in Serbia Category:6th century in the Byzantine Empire Category:7th century in the Byzantine Empire Category:6th century in Serbia Category:7th century in Serbia Category:Buildings of Justinian I Category:Archaeological Sites of Exceptional Importance Category:610s in the Byzantine Empire ",
