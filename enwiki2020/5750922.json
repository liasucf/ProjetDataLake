    "text": "The dove: iconographic symbol of the Holy Spirit \"Veni Sancte Spiritus\", sometimes called the \"Golden Sequence\", is a sequence prescribed in the Roman Liturgy for the Masses of Pentecost and its octave, exclusive of the following Sunday.Liber Usualis, pp. 880-81. Solesmes 1961. It is usually attributed to either the thirteenth-century Pope Innocent III or to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Cardinal Stephen Langton, although it has been attributed to others as well. \"Veni Sancte Spiritus\" is one of only four medieval Sequences which were preserved in the Roman Missal published in 1570 following the Council of Trent (1545\u201363). Before Trent many feasts had their own sequences.David Hiley, Western Plainchant : A Handbook (OUP, 1993), II.22, pp.172-195 It is still sung today in some parishes on Pentecost. It has been set to music by a number of composers, especially during the Renaissance, including Dufay, Josquin, Willaert, Palestrina, John Dunstaple, Lassus, Victoria, and Byrd. Later composers who have set the text include Arvo P\u00e4rt, Morten Lauridsen, Frank La Rocca, George Fenton, and Samuel Webbe.Cyber Hymnal, \"O\" titles, #347 http://www.hymntime.com/tch/htm/c/t/h/cthscome.htm == Text == {| |- !Original Latin text !Literal English translation !ICEL English translation !J.

Consolator optime, dulcis hospes animae, dulce refrigerium. In labore requies, in aestu temperies, in fletu solatium. O lux beatissima, reple cordis intima tuorum fidelium. Sine tuo numine, nihil est in homine, nihil est innoxium. Lava quod est sordidum, riga quod est aridum, sana quod est saucium. Flecte quod est rigidum, fove quod est frigidum, rege quod est devium. Da tuis fidelibus, in te confidentibus, sacrum septenarium. Da virtutis meritum, da salutis exitum, da perenne gaudium. |Come, Holy Spirit, send forth the heavenly radiance of your light. Come, father of the poor, come, giver of gifts, come, light of the heart. Greatest comforter, sweet guest of the soul, sweet consolation. In labour, rest, in heat, temperance, in tears, solace. O most blessed light, fill the inmost heart of your faithful. Without your spirit, there is nothing in man, nothing that is not harmful. Cleanse that which is unclean, water that which is dry, heal that which is wounded. Bend that which is inflexible, fire that which is chilled, correct what goes astray. Give to your faithful, those who trust in you, the sevenfold gifts. Grant the reward of virtue, grant the deliverance of salvation, grant eternal joy. |Holy Spirit, Lord of light, From Thy clear celestial height Thy pure beaming radiance give. Come, Thou Father of the poor, Come with treasures which endure, Come, Thou Light of all that live. Thou, of all consolers best, Thou, the soul\u2019s delightsome Guest, Dost refreshing peace bestow. Thou in toil art comfort sweet, Pleasant coolness in the heat, Solace in the midst of woe. Light immortal, Light divine, Visit Thou these hearts of Thine, And our inmost being fill. If Thou take Thy grace away, Nothing pure in man will stay; All his good is turned to ill. Heal our wounds; our strength renew; On our dryness pour Thy dew; Wash the stains of guilt away. Bend the stubborn heart and will; Melt the frozen, warm the chill; Guide the steps that go astray. Thou, on those who evermore Thee confess and Thee adore, In Thy sevenfold gifts descend: Give them comfort when they die, Give them life with Thee on high; Give them joys that never end. |Come, Thou holy Paraclete, And from Thy celestial seat Send Thy light and brilliancy: Father of the poor, draw near; Giver of all gifts, be here; Come, the soul\u2019s true radiancy. Come, of comforters the best, Of the soul the sweetest guest, Come in toil refreshingly: Thou in labour rest most sweet, Thou art shadow from the heat, Comfort in adversity. O Thou Light, most pure and blest, Shine within the inmost breast Of Thy faithful company. Where Thou art not, man hath nought; Every holy deed and thought Comes from Thy divinity. What is soil\u00e8d, make Thou pure; What is wounded, work its cure; What is parch\u00e8d, fructify; What is rigid, gently bend; What is frozen, warmly tend; Strengthen what goes erringly. Fill Thy faithful, who confide In Thy power to guard and guide, With Thy sevenfold mystery. Here Thy grace and virtue send: Grant salvation to the end, And in Heav\u2019n felicity. |} ==References== ==External links== * H.T. Henry.
