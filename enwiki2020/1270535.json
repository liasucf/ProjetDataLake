    "text": "Oblique view from Apollo 15 The Gardner Megadome, from Apollo 17 Gardner is a small lunar impact crater in the northeast part of the Moon and is named after an American physicist Irvine Clifton Gardner. It lies due east of the crater Vitruvius, in a section of rough terrain north of the Mare Tranquillitatis. Gardner was previously designated Vitruvius A before being given its present name by the IAU. To the northeast of Gardner is the larger crater Maraldi. It is a circular crater with sloping inner walls and an interior floor that occupies about half the total crater diameter. The southern half of the floor has a slight rise before reaching the inner wall. The crater is not significantly eroded, and the outer rim is relatively sharp and well-defined. The most distinctive feature is a row of four rounded hills along the northern floor of the crater. To the south is an elevated area unofficially known as the Gardner Megadome.The Lamont - Gardner Megadome Alignment: A Lunar Volcano- Tectonic Structure? Charles A.
