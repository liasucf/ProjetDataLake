    "text": "Albert James Aldridge (c. July 1863 \u2013 22 June 1891) was an English footballer who played as a full back. He was born in Walsall, won the FA Cup in 1888 and represented the England national football team twice. ==Career== Aldridge started his career at hometown club Walsall Swifts where he spent six seasons. He played in nine FA Cup ties and scored one goal, in a third round win over Mitchell St George's in January 1885. In March 1886 Aldridge moved to West Bromwich Albion where he earned his first cap for England in a British Home Championship match against Ireland in Belfast. He had great success in the FA Cup while at West Bromwich Albion, helping them to the final in 1887, and to win the trophy in 1888 by beating the much-fancied Preston North End in the final. Despite his cup heroics, Aldridge moved back to the newly merged Walsall Town Swifts during that summer. He played in 13 matches in the Midland Association for the Saddlers in 1888\u20131889 and earned his second, and final, England cap in a match against Ireland in the British Home Championship at Anfield. Aldridge was the second player to play for England while at Walsall, after Alf Jones who appeared for the national side while playing for Walsall Swifts in 1882. In 1889 Aldridge joined Aston Villa, where he made 14 appearances in the First Division as Villa finished as runners-up. ==Death== Aldridge died on 22 June 1891 at his home in Walsall, due to poor health. He was only 27 years old. ==Honours== West Bromwich Albion *FA Cup winner: 1888 *FA Cup runner-up: 1887 ==References== ==External links== Category:1863 births Category:1891 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Walsall Category:English footballers Category:England international footballers Category:Association football fullbacks Category:Walsall F.C. players Category:Aston Villa F.C. players Category:West Bromwich Albion F.C. players Category:English Football League players ",
