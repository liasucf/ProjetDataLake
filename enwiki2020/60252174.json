    "text": "\"Fall\" is a song by Nigerian singer Davido, released as the second single from his second studio album A Good Time (2019). The song was produced by Nigerian record producer Kiddominant. According to Rolling Stone magazine, \"Fall\" was one of the top-100-most-Shazam-searched singles in America in January 2019, and was a top-10 record on Shazam in New York. In February 2019, \"Fall\" became the longest charting Nigerian pop song in Billboard history. It was ranked at number 163 on Pitchforks list of the 200 Best Songs of the 2010s. As of March 2020, \"Fall\" has received over 40 million streams on Spotify, and has been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and Music Canada. ==Background== Davido recorded \"Fall\" in 2017. He samples a line from Kojo Funds's hit single \"Dun Talking\". Davido revealed to Metro newspaper he was inspired by \"Dun Talking\" and reached out to Kojo Funds prior to releasing \"Fall\". In February 2019, Busta Rhymes and his artist Prayah released a remix of \"Fall.\" Rhymes used Instagram to build hype around the song before releasing it. However, their version was taken down by YouTube under a directive from Sony Music. ==Music video and synopsis== The accompanying music video for \"Fall\" was directed by Nigerian-born British music video director Daps. In December 2018, the video surpassed 100 million views, becoming the most-viewed video by a Nigerian artist on Youtube. During the video's opening, Davido appears to be in a heated argument with his lover. He exits a Rolls-Royce after the argument and spends the rest of the video daydreaming about being with a ballerina from behind a glass window. Toye Sokunbi of Native magazine stated, \"this is consistent with his lyrics that he no longer wants to be a player, so it comes as no surprise that he is seen at the end of the video, apparently brushing off the temptation of being with someone else\". ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US R&B;/Hip-Hop Airplay (Billboard) |13 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot R&B; Songs (Billboard) |25 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US World Digital Song Sales (Billboard) |3 |} == Certifications == |- ==References== Category:2017 songs Category:2017 singles Category:Davido songs Category:Song recordings produced by Kiddominant ",
