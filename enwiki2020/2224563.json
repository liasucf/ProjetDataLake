Numerous artists submitted trial pages and in the end Vivian's entry was chosen over others including Dan Russell (whom Packer thought that his brother Jim Russell had drawn instead). He then drew the comic for ACP's Sunday Telegraph from April 1953 for the next twenty one years, until his death in early 1973.
