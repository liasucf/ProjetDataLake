    "text": "Salvadoran rap is rap music that comes from El Salvador. It is a style of music that emerged with groups such as Pescozada and Mecate in the late 1990s. Salvadoran hip hop arose about 30 years ago when a large surge of Salvadorans began to migrate towards LA.Their time of arrival was similar to a surge in hip hop in the United States so they began to participate. Salvadoran hip hop is still a smaller kind of music but it is an important part to communities and the lives of many Salvadorans. ==See also== *List of Salvadoran hip hop musicians *Reyes del Bajo Mundo ==References== Hip hop Category:Latin hip hop ",
