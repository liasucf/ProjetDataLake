    "text": "Son of Frankenstein is a 1939 American horror film directed by Rowland V. Lee. The film is the third entry in Universal Pictures' Frankenstein series and was follow-up to Bride of Frankenstein. The film stars Basil Rathbone as Baron Wolf von Frankenstein along with his wife Elsa (Josephine Hutchinson) and son Peter (Donnie Dunagan) who return to his late father's estate. Although he has no plans on returning to father's work of resurrecting the dead, he is under suspicion from the town's villagers and Insp. Krogh (Lionel Atwill). Also near the castle is Ygor (Bela Lugosi) the crazed shepherd whose neck was broken in an unsuccessful hanging attempt. Frankenstein discovers among the castle the remains of the Monster (Boris Karloff) and decides to try save his family name by resurrecting the creature to prove his father right but finds that monster only responds to Ygor's commands. Son of Frankenstein was originally announced in August 1938 after a successful theatrical reissue of Dracula and Frankenstein. The film was initially announced under the title of After Frankenstein. The screenplay written by Willis Cooper was initially rejected and early drafts of the film predominantly only carried the characters that would be used in the final film. The original budget for the film was set at $250,000 but was increased to $300,000 by Lee and had a 27 day shooting schedule. Difficulties in production arose with Lee being unsatisfied with the script. Production was delayed until November 9 and due to other production difficulties such as poor weather, filming only completed on January 5, 1939 with the final cost of the film being $420,000. The film was released on January 13, 1939 and received positive reviews The New York Daily News, The New York Times, Variety and the Monthly Film Bulletin. A sequel, The Ghost of Frankenstein was released in 1942. ==Plot== Baron Wolf von Frankenstein (Basil Rathbone), son of Henry Frankenstein, relocates his wife Elsa (Josephine Hutchinson) and their young son Peter (Donnie Dunagan) to the family castle. Wolf wants to redeem his father's reputation, but finds that such a feat will be harder than he thought after he encounters hostility from the villagers, who resent him for the destruction his father's monster wreaked years before. Aside from his family, Wolf's only friend is the local police Inspector Krogh (Lionel Atwill) who bears an artificial arm, his real arm having been \"ripped out by the roots\" in an encounter with the Monster as a child. While investigating his father's castle, Wolf meets Ygor (Bela Lugosi), a demented blacksmith who has survived a hanging for graverobbing and has a deformed neck as a result. Wolf finds the Monster's comatose body in the crypt where his grandfather and father were buried; his father's sarcophagus bears the phrase \"Heinrich von Frankenstein: Maker of Monsters\" written in chalk. He decides to revive the Monster to prove his father was right, and to restore honor to his family. Wolf uses the torch to scratch out the word \"Monsters\" on the casket and write \"Men\" beneath it. When the Monster (Boris Karloff) is revived, it only responds to Ygor's commands and commits a series of murders; the victims were all jurors at Ygor's trial. Wolf discovers this and confronts Ygor. Wolf shoots Ygor and apparently kills him. The Monster abducts Wolf's son as revenge, but cannot bring himself to kill the child. Krogh and Wolf pursue the Monster to the nearby laboratory, where a struggle ensues, during which the Monster tears out Krogh's false arm. Wolf swings on a rope and knocks the Monster into a molten sulphur pit under the laboratory, saving his son. Wolf leaves the keys to Frankenstein's castle to the villagers. The film ends with the village turning out to cheer the Frankenstein family as they leave by train. ==Cast== Cast sourced from the American Film Institute and the book Universal Horrors. ==Production== ===Development=== The Universal Pictures company wanted to get back into horror film production after two year break on producing to horror films. Initially, Universal first though about remaking two previous works: The Old Dark House and The Raven but instead opted to do a new Frankenstein film after the success off the triple bill of Dracula, Frankenstein and Son of Kong at Los Angeles' Regina Theatre on Wilshire Boulevard. The screenings at the 659-seat theatre packed houses for five weeks leading to Universal to reissue Frankenstein and Dracula on one program in theatres across the United States. ===Pre-production=== The first mention of Son of Frankenstein in trade papers arrived on August 29, 1938 when The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Universal was negotiating a two-picture deal with Boris Karloff to appear in two new horror films, with the first one being a sequel to Frankenstein. By September 2, the magazine reported that Universal had announced the film as After Frankenstein. Bela Lugosi and Basil Rathbone were announced as cast members on October 20, while Universal announced in the Hollywood Reporter on October 24th that plans to have Karloff, Lugosi and Peter Lorre had fallen through as the company could get Lorre from 20th Century Fox. According to the press release, Lorre had turned down the offer as he had left working in horror films to become Mr. Moto and \"did not want to risk being \"on another meanie.\" Claude Rains was also briefly considered for the role of Wolf Frankenstein, a role that eventually went to Rathbone. Lugosi spoke about the role with Ed Sullivan shortly before the films release, stating he had to stretch eight weeks of pay over one-hundred and four weeks due the lack of work. He received a call from Eric Umann to appear at the Regina Theatre for the Dracula-Frankenstein-Son of Kong screenings and was shortly after cast in Son of Frankenstein. Lugosi declared that\"I owe it all to that little man at the Regina Theatre. I was dead and he brought me to life.\" On working with Lugosi, Lee declared that his crew let Lugosi \"work on the characterisation; the interpretation he gave us was imaginative and totally unexpected [...] when we finished shooting, there was no doubt in anyone's mind that he stole the show. Karloff's monster was weak by comparison.\" Among the cast was Josephine Hutchinson who had signed on for a two-picture deal with Universal first appearing in The Crime of Doctor Hallet and spoke about her role later stating \"doing a Frankenstein film is kind of a phony bit - you don't have to delve too deeply.\" The role of Peter was portrayed by Donnie Dunagan who had previously worked with Lee on Mother Carey's Chickens. Dunagan spoke later about his performance calling it \"corny\" and that \"they had this little kid in there with this loud voice. They kept saying \"Speak up!\" because I didn't speak that loud then... And as you speak up, your accent is always accentuated. So here's this little curly-headed jerk runnin' around there with this very deep Memphis-Texas accent! They had the courage to do that.\" The director and producer for the film was Rowland V. Lee who was 45 years old at the time and had been working in the film industry since the age of 19. It was his second film for Universal. Wyllis Cooper, the creator of the radio show Lights Out submitted an original screenplay for Son of Frankenstein that was rejected initially. This screenplay that was dated October 20, 1938 involved Wolf with his wife Else , young son Erwin arriving at Castle Frankenstein to claim inheritance. Wolf's father's will stipulates that the Monster must be remained out of commission for at least 25 years following the watch tower explosion before any inheritance be claimed. Cooper's original script had several other references to Bride of Frankenstein, including finding the skeletal remains of Doctor Septimus Pretorius, Bride of Frankenstein. The script continues with the Monster surviving the explosion and confronting Wolf to make a friend for him, threatening to kill Else and Erwin if Wolf disobeyed. Wolf's antagonist in this script is Inspector Neum\u00fcllerr who vows vengeance against the Monster for killing his father. After Wolf fails at making a friend for the Monster through dead bodies he procures, the Monster steals Erwin to take him to the lab to perform brain surgery on him. But is stopped as Wolf enters and Neum\u00fcller and his forces shoot the creature and falls into a pit. The script was changed to keep most of the characters in tact, with Neumuller becoming Krogh, who has lost an arm instead of a father, and changed the child's name to Peter. The new version also eliminated the Monster's ability to speak, which was in Cooper's original draft, and adding the character of Ygor. The film was originally set at a budget of $250,000 but was increased to $300,000 and received a planned 27 day shooting schedule. Lee briefly considered shooting the film in colour, but this idea was halted after the poor effect of Karloff's makeup looked in George Robinson's color tests. ===Production=== Son of Frankenstein originally began production on October 17, 1938 but shooting was delayed until November 9 due to Lee's dissatisfaction with Cooper's screenplay. As the cast was already on salary, the studio gave orders for Lee to go ahead which led to the budget to escalating to $500,000. The lack of completed script led to actors receiving freshly written pages just minutes before scenes were set up to be shot. The finishing date of the production was pushed back from December 10, to December 17. According to actress Josephine Hutchinson, director Rowland V. Lee did some rewriting on set. Further issues caused issues with production including exterior shooting that was plagued by rainfall and cold which forced Lee to halt some filming. In the November 30 issue of The Hollywood Reporter, Universal announced that the staff had doubled on the cutting and scoring of Son of Frankenstein in order to meet its scheduled release date. The head of the editorial, sound and music departments (Maurice Pivar, Bernard B. Brown and Charles Previn respectively) would then alert their personnel about the possibility of working through until New Year's holidays to meet the required shipping date on the first 20 prints of the film. By December 24, filming had not completed and the cast and crew were working until 6:15pm in the evening, opposed to the usual completion by noon. Production on the film was completed only on January 5, 1939. Dunagan spoke about how the film took a toll on Karloff stating that the Monster make-up \"was punishing him\" due to its weight, and that \"when we got through with that movie, my sense was that he did not like that role. And I can promise you he didn't like the costume, which had to hurt him physically\" Karloff never portrayed on the Monster again in the series and only performed again on a few one off appearances on Route 66 and at an all-star baseball game. Karloff spoke about the role in 1948, stating \"After Son, I decided the character no longer had any potentialities - the makeup did all the work\" and that \"Anybody who can take that makeup every morning deserves respect.\" Post-production units only had a few days before the set January 7 preview dates. The first cut of the film ran over 100 minutes and was cut down with the final cost of the production being $420,000. ==Release== Realart re-release lobby card for Son of Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein. Son of Frankenstein was distributed theatrically by Universal Pictures Co. on January 13, 1939. The film performed well in the box office, with the Hollywood Reporter proclaiming that the film had repated greater returns than any prior horror film in key city openings. The first weekend receipts in Los Angeles, Boston, and Richmond surpassed all previous Universal film openings in those three cities. A follow-up, The Ghost of Frankenstein was announced from Universal Pictures on November 13, 1941 announcing they had been searching for a new lead to play the title role of the monster. The next day, producer George Waggner was instructed to order the same type of make-up that Karloff wore for the new actor portraying the monster with instructions that changing the appearance may \"kill the interest of Frankenstein follower.\" Lon Chaney, Jr. was chosen for the role of the Monster. The Ghost of Frankenstein was released on March 13, 1942. In 1948, Realart Pictures Inc. secured the reissue rights to the majority of Universal Pictures library, which included the Universal monster movies. In 1952, the company re-released Son of Frankenstein theatrically. In late 1957 a television subsidiary of Columbia Pictures put together a package of Universal's films and screened them across the United States under a series titled Shock Theater. This included Son of Frankenstein. In their book Universal Horrors, the authors stated that these films were primarily how the Baby boomers generation discovered these films. In 1987, Universal/MCA found an uncut print of Son of Frankenstein and debated releasing it or the more familiar version on home video. The company decided on the latter. It was released on DVD as part of The Monster Legacy Collection and Frankenstein: The Legacy Collection on April 27, 2004. ==Reception== Gary Don Rhodes wrote that Son of Frankenstein received \"stronger reviews than generally met other horror films.\" Among contemporary reviews, a reviewer in The Hollywood Reporter declared the film as \"a knockout of its type of production, acting and effects\" as Lee's direction \"keeps a chillingly sombre mood, and the grim humor that's in it, he handles very well indeed.\" The Motion Picture Herald declared that the film \"is a masterpiece in the demonstration of how production settings and effects can be made assets emphasizing literary melodrama.\" Kate Cameron of The New York Daily News declared that Lee \"created an eerie atmosphere for the story and he has put into the working out of the plot enough horror to send the chills and shivers racing up and down the spectators' backs\" B. R. Crisler of The New York Times reported that the film could be considered \"the silliest picture ever made\", yet implements \"a very shrewd silliness, perpetrated by a good director in the best traditions of cinematic horror, so that even while you laugh at its nonsense you may be struck with the notion that perhaps that's as good a way of enjoying oneself at a movie as any\". In a Variety review, the film was noted as being \"well mounted, nicely directed, and includes [a] cast of capable artists\". The Monthly Film Bulletin stated that \"since the whole atmosphere of the film is so far removed from everyday reality it is impossible to take the horrors very seriously\", though noting that for a film \"of its kind, however, the production is good and of a high technical quality\", and praised the performances of Rathbone and Atwill. From retrospective reviews, The authors of the book Universal Horrors proclaimed that Son of Frankenstein was \"the last of the great Frankenstein films.\" with \"every aspect of the picture, from the acting to the technical departs, is first-rate\" concluding that the film was \"Grandiose in scope, magnificent in design, it supplanted the quaint romanticsm and delicate fantasy flavoring of Bride of Frankenstein with a stark, grimly expressionistic approach to horror.\" Jim Hoberman of The Village Voice praised Lugosi's performance as Ygor, writing that he \"pretty much steals the movie in his last really juicy role\". Richard Gilliam of AllMovie marked the film as unusual due to its high quality despite being the third film in the series and noted the \"strong story, fine inherited production motifs, and an excellent cast\" while noting that the film was still a step- down from the two previous Frankenstein films. Writing for Starburst in the early 1980s, Phil Edwards stated that Son of Frankenstein was \"not particularly novel and the somewhat hackneyed story points the way to the sad direction which later Universal horrors would follow.\" On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 95%, based on 37 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Boris Karloff's final appearance as the Monster is a fitting farewell before the series descended into self-parody\". ==See also== * List of films featuring Frankenstein's monster * Frankenstein in popular culture ==References== ===Footnotes=== ===Sources=== * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== * * Category:1939 films Category:1939 horror films Category:American science fiction horror films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Frankenstein films Category:American films about revenge Category:Films directed by Rowland V.
