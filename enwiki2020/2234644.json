    "text": "The Acc\u00fcsed is an American crossover thrash band from Seattle, Washington, founded in 1981. The band was a progenitor of the crossover style that bridged the gap between thrashcore and thrash metal, later influencing grindcore and some crust punk bands; as well as an influential band in the Seattle area alternative scene. The band calls their music \"splattercore\", and their zombie mascot, Martha Splatterhead, appears on most of their albums. Common themes involve social issues and the theme of Martha Splatterhead coming back from the dead to slaughter rapists and child molesters. The band name \"The ACCUSED\" is a United States Registered Trademark (#5674245). == History == ===Early years (1981\u20131992)=== The Acc\u00fcsed was created in 1981 in Oak Harbor, Washington by bassist Chibon 'Chewy' Batterman; drummer Dana Collins; and guitarist Tommy Niemeyer. John Dahlin was the vocalist from 1982 to 1984. The band's first two demo cassettes and their album, Please Pardon Our Noise, It Is the Sound of Freedom, released in 1983 drew heavily from hardcore punk. In 1984 the Fartz vocalist, Blaine Cook, replaced Dahlin. In 1984 the band began adopting metal into their sound and dubbed their style \"splatter rock\", in 'homage' to their favorite genre of horror films. According to a review, \"Their hybrid musical formula was distinguishable by Cook's unusual choking-sound vocals, Niemeyer's muted, choppy, buzz-saw guitars, dark metallic riffs, and Dana Collins rapid- fire, double-kick drumming.\" The band also created the zombie mascot, Martha Splatterhead, whose likeness (created by Niemeyer) adorns most of their albums and many of their promotional items. A recurring theme in the band's lyrics involve Martha Splatterhead coming back from the dead to eviscerate and slaughter rapists and child molesters. They released their first full EP, Martha Splatterhead, in 1985 on their own Condar label. Their first full- length LP was The Return of Martha Splatterhead, released on Subcore Records, and later re-released on Earache Records (the first mosh album), in 1986. According to reviewer Jeb Branin, \"I was writing for a zine in Canada called Northern Metal that reviewed the new LP The Return Of Martha Splatterhead giving it a 0.0 rating and absolutely crucifying it in the review. It is the only 0.0 review I remember ever seeing in Northern Metal. They hated it so much I knew I had to buy it. As I suspected, the album was a masterpiece of hardcore hysteria.\" The LPs More Fun Than an Open Casket Funeral and Martha Splatterhead's Maddest Stories Ever Told quickly followed, as well a number of other annual releases. Starting with Hymns For the Deranged, the band also began working with Seattle producer Jack Endino, and their next album, Grinning Like An Undertaker, with Josh Sinder now on drums, was released on Nastymix Records followed by the EP \"Straight Razor\". The band maintained an active touring schedule, and according to a review, \"...live, The Acc\u00fcsed were untouchable ... the whole band was a frenzy of epileptic gyrations, although Blaine's high flying leaps and bouncing off the walls like a deranged gnome were definitely the highlight ... even in today's underground you aren't going to find a more devastating band than The Acc\u00fcsed.\" The Acc\u00fcsed took an 11-year hiatus in 1992, with members taking time to play in other Seattle bands, such as the Fartz and Gruntruck. ===Re-formation (2003\u20132010 and 2019)=== The Acc\u00fcsed re-formed in 2003, playing live shows in the Seattle area, and in 2005 released the album Oh, Martha! on the band's CONDAR label. This \"comeback record\" landed on Revolver magazine's Top Ten Albums of the Year and writer's lists from Metal Maniacs magazine. Oh, Martha! followed the tradition of many earlier releases by The Acc\u00fcsed in that it featured a track with a guest lead singer. In this case, guitarist Tommy Niemeyer sang lead vocals on the angry \"13 Letters\" (though no lead vocal credit was printed on the album). In 2006 a limited-edition, split 7\" with Whidbey Island, Washington's punk icons Potbelly was released. The Acc\u00fcsed 2003 reunion line-up was short-lived, however, as a newly reformed version of the band surfaced in 2006, and yet another incarnation in Summer 2019. In an interview with Rock-A-Rolla, Tom Niemeyer stated that, during one of the band's many line-up changes, Mike Patton (of Mr. Bungle) was approached for the role of vocalist, with Patton ultimately declining Niemeyer's offer due to being \"totally booked up\". Patton did suggest Brad Mowen (ASVA, Burning Witch, Mommy, Master Musicians of Bukkake, et al.) who joined The Acc\u00fcsed in 2006. The 'new' line-up released two new songs, via free download, \"Scotty Came Back\" and \"Fuck Sorry\", January 26, 2007. In 2009, the band released their sixth full-length album, The Curse of Martha Splatterhead, via Southern Lord Records. The album's first pressing sold-out quickly and received widespread critical praise, forcing Southern Lord Records into a hasty 2nd-pressing of the CD title only weeks after its release. In 2010, the band was included as a part of the soundtrack for Namco Bandai Games' 2010 remake of Splatterhouse. As of April 28, 2019, the Acc\u00fcsed are, according to founding member and guitarist, Niemeyer, \"...once again active; with new material slated to be released Summer 2019, as well as a vintage 1983 Live gig from Missoula, Montana coming out on P.I.G. Records in 2019...\" Niemeyer stated The ACCUSED would also be performing live gigs in select markets accompanying both releases in the summer of 2019. After several line-up changes, the band \"...have returned with new songs, and releases of older, vintage material\u2013both due out Summer 2019; with select LIVE appearances to follow...\" according to band founder and guitarist Tommy Niemeyer. Drummer, Josh Sinder, from the Grinning Like An Undertaker and Straight Razor releases, will team up with Niemeyer as the band prepared to move ahead in the years to come. In 2019, a lineup of former members Blaine Cook, Alex Sibbald, Steve Nelson, and Steve McVay joined forces as The Acc\u00fcsed A.D. They released a music video for \"Juego Terminado,\" a song from a forthcoming album.) ==Impact== Despite being frequently cited as an influence by other punk and metal bands, the Acc\u00fcsed has largely remained in the underground. According to Sputnik Music, \"It's a shame really [that] The Acc\u00fcsed aren't recognized in the metal music industry as being one of the pioneering members of crossover thrash. These boys deserve more attention than they get.\" ==Timeline== ==Discography== ===Albums=== * 1981: Brain Damage 1 (Demo Cassette) * 1982: Brain Damage 2 (Demo Cassette) * 1983: Please Pardon Our Noise, It Is a Sound of Freedom aka Acc\u00fcsed/Rejectors Split (Fatal Erection) * 1985: Martha Splatterhead (EP, Condar) * 1986: The Return of Martha Splatterhead (LP, Subcore and Earache) * 1987: More Fun Than an Open Casket Funeral (LP, Combat) * 1987: 38 Song Archives Tapes 1981-86 (200 Cassettes Self-Released by The Acc\u00fcsed) * 1988: Martha Splatterhead's Maddest Stories Ever Told (LP, re- released in 1991 on Combat Records.) * 1988: Hymns for the Deranged (LP, Empty Records) * 1990: Grinning Like an Undertaker (LP, Sub Pop, Nastymix) * 1991: Straight Razor (EP, Nastymix) * 1992: Splatter Rock (LP, Nastymix) * 2006: Oh Martha! + Baked Tapes (Double LP, Nuclear Blast and GmbH) \u2013 666 pressed * 2006: 34 Song Archives Tapes 1981-86 (Condar; #Cond002) * 2007: Why Even Try?
