    "text": "Henry Taylor was a rugby union international who represented England from 1879 to 1882. ==Early life== Henry Taylor was born on 21 September 1858 in Greenwich. He attended Merchant Taylors' School. ==Rugby union career== Taylor made his international debut on 10 March 1879 at Edinburgh in the Scotland vs England match. Of the 5 matches he played for his national side he was on the winning side on 3 occasions. He was to have played in a sixth match but lost the night mail train to Scotland. Although not noted for his dropping powers, he was considered a first-rate halfback, who was \"wonderfully quick on the ball and at utilising an opening in his adversaries' defence. He ran low, and very strongly, though not very fast, and used his arms with great effect ; his tactics in point of attack were his best points, and he did excellent service for England.\"Marshall, Francis, Football; the Rugby union game, p161, (1892) (London Paris Melbourne, Cassell and company, limited) He played his final match for England on 4 March 1882 at Whalley Range, Manchester in the England vs Scotland match. ==References== Category:1858 births Category:1942 deaths Category:English rugby union players Category:England international rugby union players Category:Rugby union halfbacks Category:People educated at Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood Category:Blackheath F.C. players ",
