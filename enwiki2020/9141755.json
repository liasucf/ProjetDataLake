Some Hungarian scholars suspect him to be involved in the forgery of Codex Rohonczi. This opinion goes back as far as 1866, to K\u00e1roly Szab\u00f3 (1824-1890), Hungarian historian. == References == * SZAB\u00d3, K\u00e1roly: A r\u00e9gi hun-sz\u00e9kely \u00edr\u00e1sr\u00f3l [Of the Old Hun-Sz\u00e9kely Writing System], Budapesti Szemle 6 (1866), 123-124.
