    "text": "Arthur Howes (1876 \u2013 after 1908) was an English professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper in the Football League for Leicester Fosse and in the Scottish League for Dundee. ==Life and career== Howes was born in 1876 in Leicester, and played local football for the Waverley club before signing for Second Division club Leicester Fosse in September 1896. He played 12 league matches before moving on to Reading of the Southern League, and after a trial with Football League club Lincoln City, rejoined Leicester Fosse for another three appearances. He returned to the Southern League with Brighton United in 1899, where Tommy Spicer was first-choice goalkeeper. The club folded midway through the campaign, and Howes then went to Scotland where he played for Dumbarton and then Dundee, for whom he missed only one match in the 1901\u201302 Division One season. Returning to the Southern League, Howes then spent two seasons with Brighton & Hove Albion. In the first, he and Squire Whitehurst were both used in goal as Albion gained promotion to the Southern League First Division, but he missed only one match in his second. He then joined another Southern League club, Queens Park Rangers, where he spent three seasons, made 49 Southern League appearances, and retired through injury at the end of the 1906\u201307 campaign. ==References== Category:1876 births Category:Year of death missing Category:Sportspeople from Leicester Category:English footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Leicester City F.C. players Category:Reading F.C. players Category:Lincoln City F.C. players Category:Brighton United F.C. players Category:Dumbarton F.C. players Category:Dundee F.C. players Category:Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. players Category:Queens Park Rangers F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Southern Football League players Category:Scottish Football League players ",
