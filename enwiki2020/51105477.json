Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez de Quesada accompanied his elder brother along the ' route from 1536 to 1538'. Between 1540 and 1542 Hern\u00e1n first went north of Sogamoso and then southeast to Caquet\u00e1 and Putumayo and southwest through northern Peru, terminating in Quito. Hern\u00e1n and his younger brother Francisco died in the Caribbean Sea, off the coast of Cabo de la Vela, the northeastern peninsula of Colombia ==== 1536 - the harsh route towards Muisca territory ==== Guane and Muisca territories, the curious but cautious indigenous people provided the conquistadors with fresh cotton mantles for their journey into the Altiplano Cundiboyacense The first indigenous group that was submitted to the Spanish Crown were the Tairona, who inhabit the area around Santa Marta, presently living on the slopes of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and in Tayrona Park. On April 6, 1536, triggered by the stories of the mythical \"City of Gold\" El Dorado, Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada organised two groups of conquistadors towards the inner highlands of the Colombian Andes, as first European explorers. The army with the brothers De Quesada and more than 700 soldiers and 80 horses went over land and another, of more than 200 men, embarked in boats and ascended the Magdalena River from Ci\u00e9naga, in search of its origin. The list of the soldiers that eventually made it to Funza has been compiled by Juan Florez de Oc\u00e1riz (1612-1692). List of conquistadors led by Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada - Banco de la Rep\u00fablica The land army was led by Gonzalo with Hern\u00e1n second in command. The first indigenous group conquered, were the Chimila people. Continuing south, the troops had to cross inhospitable terrains full of creeks and part of their supplies and equipment was lost when crossing the Ariguan\u00ed River. Conquista r\u00e1pida y saqueo cuantioso de Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada The troops led by the De Quesadas passed through among other settlements Tamalameque, Barrancabermeja and Chipat\u00e1 where the Spanish for the first time learnt to drink chicha, the fermented alcoholic beverage of the Muisca. The almost-naked conquistadors who suffered from the difficult expedition through the jungles received cotton mantles from the Muisca people in Chipat\u00e1. The expedition passed through halted in Ch\u00eda where they spent the Holy Week. After that week in April 1537, he ordered his men towards Funza, the site of the domain of the zipa. Although the army of the brothers De Quesada was reduced to 170 men, the hundreds of guecha warriors couldn't resist their superior arms and were defeated. In the meantime, zipa Tisquesusa sent messengers to the caciques in the Muisca Confederation to inform them of the arrival of the light-skinned heavily armed men. The caciques considered the invaders sacred and didn't dare to attack them. Funza was conquered and founded on April 20, 1537. Official website Funza Of the more than 900 soldiers who left Santa Marta a year earlier, only 162 survived the harsh expedition. On the same day that his brother Gonzalo founded Tenza, June 24, 1537, Hern\u00e1n founded Sutatausa.

De Quesada divided the conquered treasures over his men; 40,000 pieces of fine gold, 562 emeralds and tumbaga (gold-copper-silver alloys). Foot soldiers received 520 pieces each, horse riders the double amount, captains 2080 pieces, generals 3640 and some pieces were given as prizes for the most distinguished soldiers. Masses were organised to honour the many dead soldiers during the campaign and part of the treasure was given to Juan de las Casas. De Quesada was not pleased to hear about the advancement of another group of conquistadors in the east, led by Nikolaus Federmann, coming from later Venezuela across the Llanos Orientales. Another team of conquerors, commanded by Sebasti\u00e1n de Belalc\u00e1zar, was coming from the south, originating from Quito. Gonzalo sent Hern\u00e1n to meet the southern group who had traveled through the hot valley of Neiva. Hern\u00e1n ordered the decapitation of Aquiminzaque, the last zaque of Hunza in late 1538. Public execution of Aquiminzaque in Tunja - Universidad Distrital Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Caldas === Foundation of Bogot\u00e1 === One and a half year after the victory of the conquistadors on Tisquesusa, in the area of Teusaquillo, the modern capital of Colombia was founded. Although some historians set the date at April 27, 1539, the common and celebrated date of foundation is August 6, 1538. The foundation was performed by the construction of 12 houses of reed, referring to the Twelve Apostles, and the construction of a preliminary church, also of reed. Father Juan de las Casas held his first mass in the improvised church. The city was named Santaf\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1, a combination of the Spanish city of Santa Fe and the Chibcha name of the southern Muisca capital Bacat\u00e1, meaning \"Enclosure outside of the farmfields\".

Gonzalo assigned Hern\u00e1n as interim governor of the New Kingdom and chose the first mayor and council for the capital. The chaplain of the team of Federmann, Juan Verdejo, was named priest. Most of the soldiers of the expeditions of Federmann and De Belalc\u00e1zar decided to stay in Bogot\u00e1, reinforcing the troops of De Quesada. Without having found El Dorado, three years after his departure from Santa Marta, in mid May 1539, Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada returned to the Caribbean coast, to sail to Spain from Cartagena. === Hern\u00e1n in charge of the New Kingdom of Granada === ==== 1540-1541 ==== In his search for El Dorado, Hern\u00e1n explored the departments of Tolima and Huila. Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez de Quesada was only one of many explorers in the search for El Dorado. Expeditions El Dorado After the destruction and looting of the Sun Temple in Sogamoso in September 1537, Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez thought there was an even bigger place where the indigenous people hid their gold, called \"La Casa del Sol\". In his quest, starting from Sogamoso along the right banks of the Chicamocha River, he approached with a hundred men the terrain of the Lache and entered Jeric\u00f3, at that time called Cheva, where he and his troops gathered the food of the original inhabitants who promptly fled to Chita. Jeric\u00f3, un municipio de altura - El Tiempo The city of Tunja, in the times of the Muisca called Hunza, was founded on 1541 by Gonzalo Su\u00e1rez Rend\u00f3n in an expedition ordered by Hern\u00e1n de Quesada. In July 1541, the Chapter of Tunja told De Quesada that he couldn't leave his empire alone. Hern\u00e1n responded that \"whatever he did, was in the interest of the Spanish Crown\".Kupchick, 2008, p.132 Later in 1541, Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez de Quesada went northward towards the later department of Norte de Santander, where he crossed Panqueba, Guacamayas, El Cocuy and Chita, and reached Chin\u00e1cota but had to return soon after that.
