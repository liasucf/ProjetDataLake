In the Middle Ages it was part of Poland, located in northern Greater Poland. The town's name derives from the city of Kalisz in southern Greater Poland. In order to develop this sparsely populated area, duke Przemys\u0142 I brought settlers from Kalisz to the settlement, which was newly named in Latin Nova Calisia (meaning New Kalisz). It was part of the Kingdom of Prussia from the 18th century and until 1945 stayed part of Germany. During World War II, in 1944\u20131945, the Germans operated a subcamp of the Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp in the town, in which they imprisoned around 500\u20131,000 people at a time.Der Ort des Terrors: Geschichte der nationalsozialistischen Konzentrationslager, Vol. IV, 2006, p. 559 (in German) After the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, the town became part of Poland again. ==Gallery== Mlynskie (Ogorkowe) Lake in Kalisz Pomorski.jpg|M\u0142y\u0144skie Lake Kalisz Pomorski palac Wedlow (1).jpg|Palace in Kalisz Pomorski Kalisz Pomorski LO.jpg|High school PL KaliszPom Nadlesnictwo.JPG|Forest office building ==Notable residents== * Paul Sydow (1851 \u2013 1925), German mycologist and lichenologist ==International relations== ===Twin towns \u2014 Sister cities=== Kalisz Pomorski is twinned with: * Kaltenkirchen, Germany * Torgelow, Germany * Putlitz, Germany ==References== ==External links== * http://www.kaliszpom.pl/ Category:Cities and towns in West Pomeranian Voivodeship Category:Drawsko County ",
