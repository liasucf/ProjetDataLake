    "text": "Ekaterina Fyodorovna Kolyschkine de Hueck Doherty (August 15, 1896 \u2013 December 14, 1985), was a Russian-Canadian Catholic social worker and founder of the Madonna House Apostolate. A pioneer of social justice and a renowned national speaker, Doherty was also a prolific writer of hundreds of articles, best- selling author of dozens of books, and a dedicated wife and mother. Her cause for canonization as a saint is under consideration by the Catholic Church.Catherine Doherty: Her Life, catherinedoherty.org ==Early life== Doherty was born Ekaterina Fyodorovna Kolyschkine (\u0415\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0424\u0451\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u043b\u044b\u0448\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0430) in Nizhny Novgorod, Russian Empire. Her parents, Fyodor and Emma Thomson Kolyschkine, belonged to the minor nobility and were devout members of the Russian Orthodox Church who had their child baptized in St. Petersburg on September 15, 1896. She was not baptized on the same day that she was born because her mother was worried she might get a disease as she had been born on a train. Schooled abroad due to her father's job, she had an exposure to the Catholic Church in the form of her schooling in Alexandria (Egypt) where her father, an aristocrat, had been posted by the government.Murray PP, John, \"Servant of God: Catherine de Hueck Doherty\", The Messenger, July 2007 Her family returned to St. Petersburg in 1910, where she was enrolled in the prestigious Princess Obolensky Academy. In 1912, aged 15, she married her first cousin, Boris de Hueck (1889\u20131947). At the outbreak of World War I, Catherine de Hueck became a Red Cross nurse at the front, experiencing the horrors of battle firsthand. On her return to St. Petersburg, she and Boris barely escaped the turmoil of the Russian Revolution with their lives, nearly starving to death as refugees in Finland. Together they made their way to England, where de Hueck was received into the Catholic Church on November 27, 1919. Emigrating to Canada with Boris, de Hueck gave birth to their only child, George, in Toronto in 1921. To make ends meet, she took various jobs, eventually traveling across the United States, giving talks on the Chautauqua lecture circuit.Fay, Terence J., History of Canadian Catholics, McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 2002 ===Friendship House=== Prosperous now, but deeply dissatisfied with a life of material comfort, her marriage in ruins, de Hueck began to feel the promptings of a deeper call through a passage that leaped to her eyes every time she opened the Bible: \"Arise \u2014 go... sell all you possess... take up your cross and follow Me.\" Consulting with various priests and the bishop of the diocese, she began her lay apostolate among the poor. In 1932, she gave up all her possessions, lived among the multitude of poor people in downtown Toronto and established Friendship House with its soup kitchen. She gave food to them when she had none for herself \u2013 and offered Catholic education and fellowship, too. She was tagged as a communist sympathizer and, beleaguered by her own organization,Jacobs, Donna,\"The Unlikely Story of Catherine de Hueck\", The Ottawa Citizen; July 9, 2007 Friendship House was forced to close in 1936. Catherine then went to Europe and spent a year investigating Catholic Action. On her return, she established the Friendship House at 34 West 135th Street in Harlem in 1937. The interracial charity center, in addition to distributing goods to the poor, conducted lectures and discussions to promote racial understanding.New York Times obituary, December 16, 1985 In 1943, having received an annulment of her first marriage, as she had married her cousin, which is forbidden in the Roman Catholic Church, she married Eddie Doherty, an American journalist, whom she had met when he was writing a story about her.Murray, John. \"Servant of God: Catherine de Hueck Doherty\", Catholic Ireland, November 30, 1999 ===Madonna House=== Serious disagreements arose between the staff of Friendship House and its foundress, particularly surrounding her marriage. When these could not be resolved, Doherty and Eddie moved to Combermere, Ontario, on May 17, 1947 to retire. As she recovered, she started to serve the needs of the community. What eventually blossomed was a new rural apostolate called Madonna House that now numbers approximately 200 staff workers with 17 missionary field-houses throughout the world.\"About us\", Madonna House ==Death== Catherine de Hueck Doherty died in Combermere, on December 14, 1985, at the age of 89. Since then, the cause for her canonization as a saint has been officially opened in the Catholic Church.Pelton, Fr. Robert. \"About the Author\" in Poustinia: Encountering God in Silence, Solitude and Prayer by Catherine Doherty. 3rd ed. Combermere: Madonna House Publications, 2000. ()Duquin, Lorene Hanley. They Called Her the Baroness: The Life of Catherine de Hueck Doherty . New York: Alba House, 1995. () ==Her spirituality== \"I considered Nazareth to be the center of my vocation. Only by being hidden would I be a light to my neighbor\u2019s feet in the slums,\" Doherty wrote. She believed that activism should be rooted in prayer and that faith should be brought to every aspect of daily life.LaPointe, Fr. Larry, \"Catherine de Hueck Doherty\", Connecticut College ===\"The Little Mandate\"=== The core of Doherty's spirituality is summarized in a \"distillation\" of the Gospel which she called \"The Little Mandate\" \u2014 words which she believed she received from Jesus Christ and which guided her life.Doherty, Catherine. \"The Little Mandate\", Chap. 13 in Sobornost: Experiencing Unity of Mind, Heart and Soul , 2nd ed. Combermere: Madonna House Publications, 2000. () It reads: The spirituality expressed in The Little Mandate is also known as \"the Madonna House way of life\". ===Duty of the moment=== A central theme in Doherty's spirituality is \"the duty of the moment\". As she herself put it: > The duty of the moment is what you should be doing at any given time, in > whatever place God has put you. You may not have Christ in a homeless person > at your door, but you may have a little child. If you have a child, your > duty of the moment may be to change a dirty diaper. So you do it. But you > don't just change that diaper, you change it to the best of your ability, > with great love for both God and that child.... There are all kinds of good > Catholic things you can do, but whatever they are, you have to realize that > there is always the duty of the moment to be done. And it must be done, > because the duty of the moment is the duty of God.Doherty, Catherine. \"The > Duty of the Moment.\" Chap. 12 in Dear Parents: A Gift of Love for Families . > Combermere: Madonna House Publications, 1997; ===Poustinia=== Doherty is perhaps best known for having introduced the concept of poustinia to Roman Catholicism through her best-selling book Poustinia, first published in 1975. A poustinia is a small sparsely furnished cabin or room where a person goes to pray and fast alone in the presence of God for 24 hours.Doherty, Catherine.

In July 2008, the Madonna House Apostolate returned Doherty's Order of Canada insignia to Rideau Hall as a symbolic gesture of protest over the induction of Henry Morgentaler into the order. * Dame of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem * Jules Favre Foundation Award, Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise * Woman of the Year, World Union of Catholic Women's Organizations, Rome * International Mark Twain Society * Poverello Medal, Franciscan University of Steubenville ==Cause for canonization== Doherty's cause for canonization as a saint was opened by Pope John Paul II in 2000, and she has been given the official title Servant of God \u2014 the first step on the way to being declared Venerable, then Blessed, and finally Saint. At the current stage in the process, a diocesan tribunal, as well as a historical commission, are examining Doherty's life and writings under the supervision of the bishop of the Diocese of Pembroke. ==See also== *Committee of Catholics to Fight Anti-Semitism *Eastern Catholic Churches *Hermit *Madonna House Apostolate *Our Lady of Combermere *Poustinia *Restoration (newspaper) ==References== ==External links== *Catherine Doherty's Cause for Canonization *Madonna House Apostolate *Books by Catherine Doherty Category:1896 births Category:1985 deaths Category:19th-century venerated Christians Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:Activists for African-American civil rights Category:Canadian activists Category:Canadian anti-poverty activists Category:Canadian Christian pacifists Category:Canadian civil rights activists Category:Canadian Eastern Catholics Category:Canadian hermits Category:Canadian Roman Catholic theologians Category:Catholic pacifists Category:Canadian Servants of God Category:Canadian spiritual writers Category:Catholic social teaching Category:Converts to Eastern Catholicism from Eastern Orthodoxy Category:Eastern Catholic Servants of God Category:Former Russian Orthodox Christians Category:Founders of Catholic religious communities Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to Canada Category:Leaders of Christian parachurch organizations Category:Members of the Order of Canada Category:People from Renfrew County Category:Roman Catholic activists Category:Roman Catholic writers Category:Russian Eastern Catholics Category:Russian hermits Category:Russian nobility Category:White movement people Category:White Russian emigrants to Canada ",
