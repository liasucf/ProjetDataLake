    "text": "Obrh Creek () is a losing stream that originates and terminates in the Lo\u017e Karst Field in the Municipality of Lo\u0161ka Dolina. It is a watercourse in the Ljubljanica watershed. It is created by the confluence of Little Obrh Creek () and Big Obrh Creek (); the latter is fed by two tributaries: Bre\u017ei\u010dek Creek and Vi\u0161evek Bre\u017ei\u010dek Creek (). The confluence, at which point it is simply named Obrh, lies west of the village of Pudob.Komac, Bla\u017e, Karel Natek, & Matija Zorn. 2008. Geografski vidiki poplav v Sloveniji (= Geografija Slovenije 20). Ljubljana: ZRC, p. 85. In the northwest, limestone part of the karst field, Obrh Creek starts to drain into many sinkholes, and higher water flows into Golobina Cave. The stream re-emerges at the spring of the Str\u017een River to the northwest on the southeast edge of the Cerknica Karst Field.Gunn, John (ed.). 2004. Encyclopedia of Caves and Karst Science.

Ljubljana: ZRC, p. 32. == Name == The name Obrh comes from the Slovene common noun obrh, referring to a powerful karst spring that usually surfaces below a cliff, creating a small deep lake that flows into a valley. The noun is originally a fused prepositional phrase, *ob v\u044crx\u044a 'at the summit' (i.e., at the highest point of the watercourse). == References == ==External links== * *Obrh Creek on Geopedija Category:Sinking rivers Category:Municipality of Lo\u0161ka Dolina Category:Rivers of Inner Carniola ",
