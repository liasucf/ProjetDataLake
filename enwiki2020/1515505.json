    "text": "Charles Richard \"Dick\" LeBeau ( ; born September 9, 1937) is a former American football cornerback and coach. LeBeau was active at field level in the National Football League (NFL) for 59 consecutive seasons, 14 as a player with the Detroit Lions and 45 as a coach. He spent most of his coaching career as a defensive assistant, most notably as the defensive coordinator of the Cincinnati Bengals and Pittsburgh Steelers. Described as an \"innovator\" and \"defensive football genius\", he is considered to be one of the greatest defensive coordinators of all time. LeBeau was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round of the 1959 NFL Draft before signing with the Lions, where he spent the entirety of his playing career and was named to three Pro Bowls. Upon retiring as a player in 1972, he began his coaching career the following season as the special teams coach of the Philadelphia Eagles before landing his first defensive role as the Green Bay Packers' defensive backs coach in 1976. LeBeau joined the Bengals in 1980 where he spent 19 nonconsecutive years, including 12 years as defensive coordinator. During his first stint as Cincinnati's defensive coordinator, he popularized the \"zone blitz\", which helped the Bengals make two Super Bowl appearances in Super Bowl XVI and Super Bowl XXIII. He also served as the Bengals' head coach from 2000 to 2002, his only non-assistant coaching position. In between his two stints with Cincinnati, LeBeau began a defensive assistant tenure for the Steelers in 1992 and rejoined them in 2004 after one season as the Buffalo Bills' assistant head coach. His time in Pittsburgh spanned 16 nonconsecutive years, holding the position of defensive coordinator for 13 years. LeBeau helped the Steelers make four Super Bowl appearances while serving as their defensive coordinator, winning Super Bowl XL and Super Bowl XLIII during his second stint. After leaving the Steelers for a second time in 2014, LeBeau served as the defensive coordinator and assistant head coach of the Tennessee Titans until 2017. He was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2010. ==Playing career== ===College=== LeBeau attended Ohio State University playing for famed coach Woody Hayes, and was on the 1957 national championship team, playing as a halfback on offense and a cornerback on defense. Also in 1957, playing both sides of the ball, he scored two touchdowns as Ohio State came back to beat Michigan 31\u201314. ===NFL=== He was initially drafted in the fifth round in 1959 by the Cleveland Browns but was cut in training camp. A few months later, he was signed by the Detroit Lions. He played 14 seasons in Detroit and was teamed with Hall of Famers Dick \"Night Train\" Lane, Yale Lary, and Lem Barney as part of a Detroit secondary that was one of the most feared in the NFL. Johnny Unitas always had respect for him, stating, \"Dick is a good corner. I am just glad Night Train Lane is gone.\" LeBeau is widely considered to be one of the greatest defensive backs in Lions history. He recorded 62 interceptions for 762 yards and three touchdowns. His 62 interceptions are still a Lions franchise record, and he is tied for seventh all-time in NFL history. His 762 interception return yards ranks third all-time in team history. LeBeau was also one of the most durable players in the league. In 14 years, he played 185 games \u2013 placing him fourth on Detroit's all-time list. He is third all-time for most seasons played (14) and previously held the NFL record for consecutive appearances by a cornerback with 171, which has since been broken by Ronde Barber. He also recovered nine fumbles, returning them for 53 yards and a touchdown. During his career, he earned three trips to the Pro Bowl (1964\u20131966). In 1970, LeBeau established a career-high nine interceptions (tied for sixth on the team\u2019s all-time single-season interceptions list). He was a major defensive contributor to the Lions finishing with a 10\u20134 record that season. The Lions finished second in the NFC Central and earned a berth in the playoffs. In 2010, LeBeau was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame along with running back Floyd Little. LeBeau was honored by the Lions and inducted into the Pride of the Lions in 2010. ==Coaching career== ===Early jobs=== After retirement as a player, LeBeau immediately went into coaching with the Philadelphia Eagles as a special teams coach under coach Mike McCormack, spending three seasons in Philadelphia. In 1976, LeBeau coached the secondary for the Green Bay Packers under Pro Football Hall of Fame QB Bart Starr. In his first season, Willie Buchanon, Johnnie Gray, Steve Luke, and Perry Smith combined for 10 interceptions. In 1977, Mike C. McCoy replaced Smith, and that quartet combined for 11 interceptions. In 1979, Estus Hood replaced Buchanan, and the secondary combined for another 11 interceptions. ===First stint with the Cincinnati Bengals=== In 1980, LeBeau became the Cincinnati Bengals' secondary coach; in that season, his starting secondary intercepted seven passes. In 1981, Cincinnati had an outstanding defense that had not given up more than 30 points in any of their regular season or playoff games. Their line was anchored by defensive ends Ross Browner and Eddie Edwards, who were effective at stopping the run. Cincinnati's defense was also led by defensive backs Louis Breeden and Ken Riley and linebackers Bo Harris, Jim LeClair, and Reggie Williams, who intercepted four passes and recovered three fumbles. The Bengals intercepted 19 passes for 318 yards and also recorded 41 total sacks. The Bengals played in their first AFC Championship Game, defeating San Diego 27\u20137, limiting the Chargers' offense to only 7 points. In Super Bowl XVI, the Bengals trailed 20\u20130 at halftime and lost to San Francisco, 26\u201321. In 1984, LeBeau was promoted to be the Bengals' defensive coordinator. His defenses rarely allowed more than 30 points in a game to an opponent. In 1984, his first season as defensive coordinator, the Bengals dropped from the top-ranked defense in 1983 (when they were coordinated by Hank Bullough) to 13th, allowing 339 points all season. In 1985, they dropped from 13th to 22nd. In 1986, points allowed were cut to 394 and the team finished with the 20th- ranked defense in the NFL. In 1987, they cut the points allowed to 370. In 1988, the Bengals defense ranked 17th in the league, allowing 5,556 yards and 329 points during the regular season. Cincinnati had a superb defensive line, led by pro bowl defensive tackle Tim Krumrie, along with linemen Jim Skow (nine-and-a-half sacks), David Grant (five sacks), and Jason Buck (six sacks). Pro Bowl defensive backs Eric Thomas and David Fulcher combined for 12 interceptions. The team won the AFC Central Division with a 12\u20134 record but lost Super Bowl XXIII to the San Francisco 49ers for the second time in franchise history. The following season, 1989, the Bengals defense was 15th in the NFL, an improvement of two spots and was in the top half of NFL defenses due to LeBeau's scheme. In 1990 and 1991 the Bengals' defense ranked 25th and 28th respectively, out of 28 teams, and the team made a change in defensive coordinators. ===First stint with the Pittsburgh Steelers=== LeBeau was hired by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1992 as the secondary coach. In 1994, four defensive players were called to play in the 1995 Pro Bowl (Kevin Greene, Carnell Lake, Greg Lloyd and Rod Woodson). As a secondary coach LeBeau strongly influenced Lake and Woodson. In 1995, LeBeau was promoted to be the defensive coordinator and the 1995 Pittsburgh defense ranked third in the league in total yards allowed after they had finished as the second ranked defense in 1994 in that same category, so the drop off was minimal with LeBeau at the helm. They did allow 327 points in 1995 as opposed to 234 the year before when the Steelers defense was coordinated by Dom Capers, but they got to the Super Bowl in 1995 with a much improved offense. Pro Bowl linebacker Kevin Greene led the team in sacks with nine, while Pro Bowl linebacker Greg Lloyd led the team in tackles with 86. The secondary was led by Pro Bowl defensive backs Carnell Lake and Hall of Famer Rod Woodson. The Steelers lost to the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl XXX, making it the third Super Bowl loss for him. ===Second stint with the Bengals=== In 1997, LeBeau returned to the Bengals as defensive coordinator. The defense was ranked 25th in 1996, and in his first year back they dropped to 28th and allowed just over 400 points. In 1998 they remained 28th in the NFL (of 30 teams) and allowed 452 points. In 1999 the zone blitz scheme began to take hold and although the Bengals defense allowed 460 points, they improved to 25th in the NFL (out of 31 teams). ===Head coach=== LeBeau was named interim head coach for the Bengals in 2000 following head coach Bruce Coslet's resignation during the 2000 season. Following the season, he was named permanent head coach. Despite LeBeau's considerable defensive coaching talent, his offenses were not nearly as successful as head coach, and his teams finished 4\u20139, 6\u201310 and 2\u201314, respectively, in his three seasons. His overall record as a head coach was 12\u201333. He was fired after the 2002 season. ===Buffalo Bills=== Shortly after being fired by the Bengals, LeBeau was named the Buffalo Bills's assistant head coach. ===Second stint with the Steelers=== LeBeau returned to the Steelers in 2004 as their defensive coordinator. He was the Steelers defensive coordinator until 2014. During this time frame, LeBeau coached the Steelers to 3 Super Bowl appearances, winning 2. LeBeau was named \"Coordinator of the year\" by the Sporting News for the 2008 season.Coordinator of the year: Dick LeBeau, Steelers . Retrieved on January 21, 2009. On January 10, 2015, LeBeau resigned as defensive coordinator of the Steelers. ===Tennessee Titans=== A month after resigning from the Steelers, he was hired as the assistant head coach/defense of the Tennessee Titans. On January 20, 2016, the Titans officially named LeBeau assistant head coach/defensive coordinator after the departure of Ray Horton to the Cleveland Browns. Said LeBeau, \"I like Tennessee a lot. I really love being here.\" On January 22, 2018, it was reported that LeBeau was considering retirement after not being retained after head coach Mike Mularkey and the Tennessee Titans agreed to part ways and Houston Texans' defensive coordinator Mike Vrabel was hired as the new head coach. Although LeBeau was open to returning to the Titans under Vrabel, the Titans decided to not invite him to be part of their new coaching staff. ===Legacy, defensive strategy=== As an assistant coach he is credited with inventing the \"Fire Zone\" or \"zone blitz\" defense, which employs unpredictable pass rushes and pass coverage from various players. His defenses typically employ 3\u20134 sets, with any of the four linebackers (and frequently a defensive back) among the pass rushers, while defensive linemen may drop back into short pass coverage zones to compensate for the pass rush coming from other positions. The design is intended to confuse the opposition's quarterback and frustrate its blocking schemes. Since zone blitzes don't identify any of the prospective rushers, the offense may be unsure on each play of which defenders will rush the passer and which will drop into coverage. While often described as a \"blitzing\" scheme (implying more than the typical number of four pass rushers used by most defenses), the call on any particular \"zone blitz\" play may involve only three or four pass rushers but from unpredictable positions and angles.Steelers coordinator LeBeau still the man for all seasons LeBeau is beloved among his players, many of whom refer to him as \"Coach Dad.\" Steelers players have given him many gifts, including a Rolex watch. ===Head coaching record=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text- align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"|Team !! rowspan=\"2\"|Year !! colspan=\"5\"|Regular season !! colspan=\"4\"|Postseason |- !Won!!Lost!!Ties!!Win %!!Finish!!

LeBeau says seeing the effect that Coach Bowlus had on him and his teammates clinched it for him at that point.
