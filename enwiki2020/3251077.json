The company is located in Sanok, Poland. Its sales network includes European (also non-EU countries), African and Asian countries. Currently it produces approximately 300 buses a year. ==History== The company was founded in 1832 by Walenty Lipi\u0144ski and Mateusz Beksi\u0144ski as a boilermaker's plant. The history of the factory changed depending on domestic and European economic situations. At the beginning of its activity, the factory produced devices and equipment for the oil mining, distillery and brewing industries. It later added transportation to its range and by 1894 it had become Poland's most important manufacturer of rail coaches and freight cars, tramcars and other high-capacity vehicles, while continuing to produce their initial output of boilers and other related devices. Later, even more variety of product was added, including cisterns, cranes, dredgers, road rollers, steel lifeboats, steel bridge constructions and casting articles. In 1926, Autosan launched its first lot of buses mounted on Lancia chassis. Activities were interrupted during World War II but resumed in 1950. In 1973, a new family of buses is launched - the H9 bus, with the engine mounted at the rear. It would be followed in 1984 by the high-capacity H10 model. In September 2013 the Court of Krosno declared the factory bankrupt. In a statement issued at the time it was explained that it was impossible to continue financing the restructuring. A few days later Sobies\u0142aw Zasada Group, which owned the company, sold a package of shares in Autosan to Gregory Tarnawa for one Polish zloty. Trade unionists from the factory picketed in front of the former owner, Sobies\u0142aw Zasada Group, in Krak\u00f3w, demanding payment of arrears of salary for several months. The company is still operational. Since 2001, the company has developed and produced components for rail vehicles, especially the bodies of railcars and trams. ==Products== ===Buses=== ====Current models==== * Tourist coaches ** Autosan A0808T \"Gemini\" ** Autosan A1112T \"Ramzes\" * Intercity buses ** Autosan A0808T \"Gemini\" ** Autosan A0909L \"Tramp 2\" (Autosan Scamp) ** Autosan A1010T \"Lider 3\" ** Autosan A1012T \"Lider\" ** Autosan Eurolider 12 ** Autosan Eurolider 13 ** Autosan Lider 9 eco ** Autosan Lider 9 eco2 ** Autosan A8V \"Wetlina\" (Autosan Osprey) * Local buses ** Autosan A1010T \"Lider 10\" ** Autosan H7-20MB \"Solina\" ** Autosan Sancity 9LE ** Autosan Eurolider 13LE ** Autosan Eurolider 15LE * City buses (low-floor and low-entry buses) ** Sancity 9LE ** Sancity 10LF ** Sancity 12LE ** Sancity 12LF ** Sancity 18LF ** Autosan A8V \"Wetlina City\" (Autosan Osprey) * School buses ** Autosan A0909S Smyk ** Autosan A1012T \"Eagle RHD\" * Special buses, prison vans ** Autosan A1010T DW ** Autosan H7-10ZK * Police buses for military squads ** Autosan H7-10I ====Historical buses==== Autosan H9-21, a very long-running and popular model now discontinued.
