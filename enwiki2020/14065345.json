Further, they \"facilitate the occupation, development, and utilisation of that land for the benefit of its owners, their whanau, and their hapu\". == Background == Te Ture Whenua M\u0101ori Act replaced the Maori Affairs Act 1953 and is administered by Te Puni K\u014dkiri (the Ministry of M\u0101ori Development).Te Ture Whenua M\u0101ori Act 1993, Contents Under previous Acts, like the Native Act 1894, any communally owned M\u0101ori land could be converted to freehold land (sometimes automatically). Under this Act, the M\u0101ori Land Court can \"determine and declare, by a status order, the particular status of any parcel of land\".Te Ture Whenua M\u0101ori Act 1993, s 131(1) == Provisions == === Powers to the M\u0101ori Land Court === The Treaty of Waitangi (Article 2) confirms M\u0101ori customary title (recognises that when a state acquires sovereignty over another country, the pre-existing rights of the indigenous population remain) to the land. Te Ture Whenua M\u0101ori Act 1993 gives the M\u0101ori Land Court the jurisdiction to consider this claim. Without limiting any rights of the High Court to make determinations, the M\u0101ori Land Court may declare the particular status of any land.Te Ture Whenua M\u0101ori Act 1993, s 131 For the purposes of the Act, all New Zealand land has one of six statuses: *M\u0101ori customary land *M\u0101ori freehold land *General land owned by M\u0101ori *General land *Crown land *Crown land reserved for M\u0101ori.Te Ture Whenua M\u0101ori Act 1993, s 129(1) For example, \"land that is held by M\u0101ori in accordance with tikanga M\u0101ori\" may be declared \"M\u0101ori customary land\".Te Ture Whenua M\u0101ori Act 1993, s 129(2) There are limitations to acquiring or losing this status and the status of M\u0101ori freehold land.Te Ture Whenua M\u0101ori Act 1993, s 130 === Powers to owners === The Act provides: *New forms of trusts *Ability to incorporate (so that owners have all the powers of a body corporate) *Promotes groups of buildings that allow M\u0101ori to live sustainably on their land (papakainga) Also provides for a variety of trusts which address ownership in a variety of different ways. === Restrictions on transferring ownership of M\u0101ori land === More powers are given to the M\u0101ori Land Court for enforcing when land is allowed to change hands. Land is preferably transferred to descendants of the owners. == Calls to change the act == There have been calls to have the Act changed in response to the New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy. Green Party MP Metiria Turei advocated amending the Act \"so that any customary title in foreshore and seabed could not then be turned by the court into private title\". The legislation was reviewed in 2015 and new changes to the act recommended. A proposed Bill introduced to Parliament in 2016 was controversial and it was ultimately withdrawn by the new Minister of M\u0101ori Development.https://www.waateanews.com/waateanews/x_news/MTgxNjM/National%20News/Finlayson- defends-scrapped-Maori-land-law-reform Targeted amendments were passed in 2020 instead.https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed- laws/document/BILL_91327/te-ture-whenua-maori-succession-dispute-resolution- and ==References== ==External links== * Te Ture Whenua M\u0101ori Act 1993 \u2013 text of the act Category:New Zealand Statutes Category:M\u0101ori politics Category:1993 in New Zealand law Category:1993 in law Category:Aboriginal title in New Zealand Category:Treaty of Waitangi ",
