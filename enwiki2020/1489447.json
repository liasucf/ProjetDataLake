You are aware when watching him on screen that he has transformed \u2013 he is not Robert De Niro \u2013 he is somebody else. I don't think you can learn how to do that; it's just the power of your imagination.\"Paul Stenning, (24 November 2013). Success \u2013 By Those Who've Made It. Pgs.94 and 95. In Flight Books. .

Lawson moved back to South Africa two years later to take a new job. She has a daughter, Nathalie Lunghi (b. 1986), with the director Roland Joff\u00e9. ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Year ! Title !
