In each 60 minute episode, three prominent public figures from different walks of life give their views and debate on five issues arising from the top news stories of the previous week. The program is broadcast live before a studio audience, with the viewers at home voting by telephone for the winning speaker. The results of the tele-voting are displayed throughout the show, and one caller is randomly selected each week to receive a cash prize.Krajina, Zlatan, \"Democratic Potentials of Media Entertainment: Reading \u2018The Pyramid\u2019\", Political Thought: Croatian Political Science Review, Issue 5, 2007 \u017deljka Ogresta, presenter of The Pyramid ==History== The show is written and presented by the well-known Croatian television personality, \u017deljka Ogresta, whose husband, Dubravko Merli\u0107 (head of Castor Multimedia) conceived the format.

In each cycle, the winning speakers from each of the first 9 rounds move to the second level of the pyramid. Those winners then compete at the third and top level which determines the champion of that cycle. The champions of each of the three cycles then compete in the 40th and final episode of the season, the \"Super Pyramid\". The debates in each episode are tightly structured. Each of the news issues is introduced by a thirty-second video followed by a nine-minute discussion. One guest starts the discussion and has one minute to introduce the debate, with no one allowed to interrupt. Then each of the remaining two guests gives their one-minute take on the issue. After the first speaker, each guest also has one \"right of rebuttal\", allowing them to interrupt the current speaker with an interjection lasting at most 30 seconds. When a speaker is interrupted, they have a further 60 seconds to respond. Once each speaker has been able to speak for 60 seconds without interruption, the discussion continues with the presenter asking questions of the three guests. The first speaker in the first three issues under debate is chosen by the order in which they signed for the show. The first speaker in the fourth debate is the one currently placed second in the tele-voting, while the first speaker in the fifth debate is the one currently placed last.The Pyramid Show: Rules (official web site) \u017deljka Ogresta at the rehearsal ==Re-launching== After several years of intermission The Pyramid was re-launched on 16 September 2014.
