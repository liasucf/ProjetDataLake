She married Yi Seong- gye\u2019s fifth son, Yi Bang-won in 1382 at the age of 17 making her Princess Consort Jeongnyeong of Joseon. When her husband became Crown Prince in 1400, her royal title changed to Crown Princess Consort Jeongbin of Joseon, and was eventually given the royal title of Queen Consort Jeong of Joseon in that same year. She was Queen Consort of King Taejong of Joseon, the third king of Joseon and the mother of King Sejong the Great. Her mother was given the royal title of \"Princess Consort Samhanguk of the Yeonsan Song clan\" (Hangul: \uc0bc\ud55c\uad6d\ub300\ubd80\uc778, Hanja: \u4e09\u97d3\u570b\u5927\u592b\u4eba), and her father was given the royal title of \"Internal Prince Yeoheung, Min Je\" (Hangul: \uc5ec\ud765\ubd80\uc6d0\uad70 \ubbfc\uc81c, Hanja: \u9a6a\u8208\u5e9c\u9662\u541b \u9594\u973d). Queen Wongyeong is described as smart and ambitious and with an astute political ambition, who frequently intervened in state affairs. She assisted her spouse in his way to the throne and convinced him to appoint their eldest son Yangnyeong as crown prince. When he replaced their son as crown prince with the son of a concubine, Queen Wongyeong was enraged and her interference finally resulted in King Taejong executing her younger brothers in order to keep her and her family's ambition in check. Royal Noble Consort Hyobin of the Cheongpung Kim clan was originally one of Queen Wongyeong's servants at the Min household before she became a concubine for King Taejong, and Royal Noble Consort Shinbin of the Yeongwol Shin clan was also originally one of Queen Wongyeong's retinue of assistant court ladies. == Family == * Great-Great-Grandfather ** Min Jong-yu (\ubbfc\uc885\uc720, \u9594\u5b97\u5112) (1245 - 1324) * Great-Great-Grandmother ** Lady Yu (\uc720\uc528, \u516a\u6c0f) * Great-Grandfather ** Min Jeok (\ubbfc\uc801, \u9594\u9814) (1270 - 4 March 1336) * Great- Grandmother ** Lady Won (\uc6d0\uc528, \u5143\u6c0f) * Grandfather ** Min Byeon (\ubbfc\ubcc0, \u9594\u5fed) (? - 1377) * Grandmother ** Lady Heo of the Yangcheon Heo clan (\ubcf8\uad00: \uc591\ucc9c \ud5c8\uc528, \u967d\u5ddd \u8a31\u6c0f) * Father ** Min Je (\u9594\u973d) (1339 - 1408) * Mother ** Lady Samhanguk of the Yeonsan Song clan (\uc0bc\ud55c\uad6d\ub300\ubd80\uc778 \u4e09\u97d3\u570b\u5927\u592b\u4eba) (? - 1424) * Brothers ** Older brother: Min Mu-gu (\ubbfc\ubb34\uad6c, \u9594\u7121\u548e) (? - 1410) ** Older brother: Min Mu-jil (\ubbfc\ubb34\uc9c8, \u9594\u7121\u75be) (? - 1410) ** Older brother: Min Mu-hyul (\ubbfc\ubb34\ud73c, \u9594\u7121\u6064) (? - 1416) ** Older brother: Min Mu-hui (\ubbfc\ubb34\ud68c, \u9594\u7121\u6094) (? - 1416) * Husband ** King Taejong (\ud0dc\uc885, \u592a\u5b97) (13 June 1367 - 30 May 1422) * Sons ** Yi Je, Prince Yangnyeong (\uc774\uc81c \uc591\ub155\ub300\uad70, \u674e\u7994 \u8b93\u5be7\u5927\u541b) (1394 - 1462) ** Yi Bo, Prince Hyoryeong (\uc774\ubcf4 \ud6a8\ub839\ub300\uad70, \u674e\u88dc \u5b5d\u5be7\u5927\u541b) (1396 - 1486) ** King Sejong the Great (\uc138\uc885\ub300\uc655, \u4e16\u5b97\u5927\u738b) (1397 - 1450) ** Yi Jong, Prince Seongnyeong (\uc774\uc885 \uc131\ub155\ub300\uad70, \u674e\u8908 \u8aa0\u5be7\u5927\u541b) (1405 - 1418) ** Unnamed prince (1412 - 1412) * Daughters ** Princess Jeongsun (\uc815\uc21c\uacf5\uc8fc, \u8c9e\u9806\u516c\u4e3b) (1385 - 1460) ** Princess Gyeongseong (\uacbd\uc815\uacf5\uc8fc, \u6176\u8c9e\u516c\u4e3b) (1387 - 1455) ** Princess Gyeongan (\uacbd\uc548\uacf5\uc8fc, \u6176\u5b89\u516c\u4e3b) (1393 - 1415) ** Princess Jeongseon (\uc815\uc120\uacf5\uc8fc, \u8c9e\u5584\u516c\u4e3b) (1404 - 1424) == Titles == * 29 July 1365 - 1382: 1\\.
