    "text": "The 41st Canadian Parliament was in session from June 2, 2011 to August 2, 2015, with the membership of its House of Commons having been determined by the results of the 2011 federal election held on May 2, 2011. Parliament convened on June 2, 2011, with the election of Andrew Scheer as Speaker, followed the next day with the Speech from the Throne. There were two sessions in this Parliament. On August 2, 2015, Prime Minister Stephen Harper asked the Governor General to dissolve Parliament and issue the writ of election, leading to an 11-week election campaign period for the 2015 federal election. ==Party standings== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Standings in the 41st Canadian Parliament |- !colspan=2 rowspan=2|Affiliation !colspan=2|House Members !colspan=2|Senate Members |- !2011 Election Results !At Dissolution !On Election Day 2011Members of the Canadian Senate are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister and remain senators until the age of 75, even if the House of Commons has been dissolved or an election has been called. !At Dissolution |166 |159 |52 |47 |103 |95 |0 |0 |34 |36 |46 |0 |4 |2 |0 |0 |1 |2 |0 |0 | |2 | |0 |0 |8Scott Andrews, Andr\u00e9 Bellavance, Sana Hassainia, Maria Mourani, Massimo Pacetti, Manon Perreault, Brent Rathgeber, James Lunney |2Anne Cools, Jean-Claude Rivest |6Pierre-Hugues Boisvenu, Patrick Brazeau, Anne Cools, Mike Duffy, Don Meredith, Pamela Wallin |0 |0Two members, Peter Goldring and Dean Del Mastro, were listed as Independent Conservatives during the 41st Canadian Parliament |0 |0 |0 |0 |2Elaine McCoy, Lowell Murray |0 | |0 | |29 |0 |0 |0 |1Elaine McCoy |- |colspan=2|Total members |308 |304 |103 |83 |0 |4 |3 |22 |- |colspan=2|Total seats |colspan=2|308 |colspan=2|103 |} ==Major bills and motions== ===First session=== The parliament's first session ran between June 2, 2011, and September 13, 2013, and saw 83 bills adopted. In June 2011, immediately following the election the first six bills were given royal assent. These were the enabling legislation for the 2011 Canadian federal budget, the Canada Post back-to-work legislation titled Restoring Mail Delivery for Canadians Act (Bill C-6), and the Fair and Efficient Criminal Trials Act (Bill C-2) authorizing federal judges to hear all pretrial motions at once during mega- trials. When the parliament re-convened in September 2011, the Minister of Justice introduced the Safe Streets and Communities Act (Bill C-10), an omnibus bill of nine separate measures. Among the measures include replacing the pardon system with 'record suspensions', mandatory minimum sentences and/or penalties for certain drug and sexual offences, increasing prison sentences for marijuana offences, making it illegal to make sexually explicit information available to a child, reducing the ability of judges to sentence certain offenders to house arrest, allowing immigration officers to deny work permits to foreigners who are at risk of being sexually exploited, and enabling Canadians to sue state sponsors of terrorism for losses due to an act of terrorism. The bill was reviewed by the 'House Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights' throughout October and November, chaired by Oxford MP Dave MacKenzie and passed by the House of Commons on December 5, 2011, on a 157 to 127 vote, with only the Conservative Party voting in favour. The senate made six amendments and it was given royal assent on March 13, 2012. On September 29 the Minister of Industry introduced the Copyright Modernization Act (Bill C-11]) \u2014 the same bill that was introduced in the 3rd session of the previous parliament and referred to the 'Legislative Committee on Bill C-32'. The bill is first major copyright reform since 1997 and brings Canadian copyright laws in line with modern digital rights management The act enables copyright holders to sue operators of peer-to-peer file sharing sites, makes circumventing technological protection measures (e.g. digital locks, encryption, etc.) illegal except when in the public interest, makes it illegal to remove rights management information (e.g. digital watermarks), extends moral rights for performers, makes legal the practise of copying for the purpose of backup, format shifting (CD to mp3), time shifting (recording to watch later), and expands fair dealing to include use in education, parody, and satire. However, the proposed law was criticized as \"irredeemably flawed\" due to a contradiction between consumer rights and digital locks, American interference, a requirement for students to destroy copyrighted digital content after a course ends, and makes notice and notice mandatory for all ISPs, including disclosing the identity and activity of customers suspected of copyright infringement. The bill finally passed the House of Commons on June 18 and given royal assent on June 29. The Minister of Agriculture introduced the Marketing Freedom for Grain Farmers Act (Bill C-18) which repealed the Canadian Wheat Board Act, eliminating the requirement for farmers to sell wheat and barley produce to the Canadian Wheat Board. The new act also appoints a new board of directors that must either privatize or dismantle the wheat board. The bill was studied by the 'Legislative Committee on Bill C-18' chaired by Wetaskiwin MP Blaine Calkins between October 31 and November 4. The bill was subject to a lawsuit by the wheat board's existing board of directors claiming that the government cannot change the mandate of the wheat board without the consent of its members and a counter-suit which sought to prevent the board of directors from using wheat board revenue for legal action against the government. A federal trial court decided that for the bill to be legal the government required the consent of the affected farmers, via a vote or plebiscite, as provided for in the 1998 Canadian Wheat Board Act, although that case is in appeal . Nevertheless, on November 28, the bill was passed by the House of Commons, with only the Conservative Party voting in favour. The bill was reviewed by the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry in December and passed by the Senate on December 15, 2011. Despite the ruling of the judicial branch, Governor General David Johnston gave royal assent to the bill on the same day. The Minister of Public Safety introduced the Ending the Long-gun Registry Act (Bill C-19) which amends the Criminal Code and the Firearms Act to remove the requirement to register firearms that are neither prohibited nor restricted and requires that the existing records relating to non-restricted firearms in the Canadian Firearms Registry be destroyed. The registration of long guns had been a divisive issue since its inception in 1995. The bill was introduced on October 25 and reviewed by the 'House Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security' throughout November, chaired by Crowfoot MP Kevin Sorenson. With no amendments made to the bill in committee, it was passed on February 15 by the House of Commons on a 159 to 130 vote, with only two opposition MPs voting in favour. The bill was passed by the senate on April 5, 2012, and given royal assent the next day. The Minister of Public Safety also introduced the Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act (Bill C-30) which proposed to amend the Criminal Code to grant law enforcement agencies new powers, such as online surveillance or warrantless wiretapping, to combat criminal activity on the internet. The bill has met with criticism from privacy groups, opposition MPs and the public over charges that the law would infringe on the privacy rights of Canadian citizens. Toews responded to the opposition by stating, addressing a Liberal MP, \"He can either stand with us or stand with the child pornographers\" which was received negatively. The bill was introduced on February 14, 2012, and declared dead a year later when the Response to the Supreme Court of Canada Decision in R. v. Tse Act (Bill C-55) was introduced which also makes provisions for online surveillance and warrantless wiretapping. Senate leader Majorly LeBreton introduced the Safe Food for Canadians Act (Bill S-11) which was part of a response to tainted meat being discovered coming from the XL Foods processing plant in September 2012. The act made numerous changes to the food regulatory system, including requiring better tracking of products, providing food inspectors more authority and increasing penalties for violations. The Minister of Justice introduced the Not Criminally Responsible Reform Act (Bill C-54) on February 8, 2013. The legislation proposes to create a \"high risk\" designation for people found guilty of a crime but not criminally responsible due to a mental disorder and enshrines in law that the safety of the public is paramount in deciding whether and how such a person can re-enter society. ===Omnibus bills=== On April 26, 2012, the Minister of Finance introduced the Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act (Bill C-38), an omnibus bill that amends over 50 laws. The bill makes numerous amendments to the environmental assessment process, including increasing the threshold for which reviews are required, limiting the scope of the reviews, shortening review times, moving environmental reviews of pipeline projects to the National Energy Board and nuclear projects to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, enabling the delegation of reviews to provincial agencies, limiting reviews of fish habitats to only the fish used for commercial, recreation or first nations purposes, making reviews of migratory birds optional (at the discretion of cabinet), and limits public participation to only those individuals who directly impacted by a proposal or are specifically sought by the review agency for their specialized knowledge. The omnibus bill would also repeal the Kyoto Protocol Implementation Act and the Fair Wages and Hours of Labour Act, eliminates the National Council of Welfare, and the International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development, the regulatory agency Assisted Human Reproduction Canada, the Public Appointments Commission, the National Roundtable on the Environment and the Economy, and the Canadian Artists and Producers Professional Relations Tribunal, as well as eliminates the office of the inspector general at the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and certain reviews by Auditor General. It creates a new department called Shared Services Canada and replaces the Employment Insurance Board of Referees with the Social Security Tribunal. The bill also provides for moving the Old Age Security pension threshold from 65 to 67 years old, and provides for the deprecation of the penny and social insurance number cards. The government was criticized for limiting debate on the 420-page bill to only seven days. The bill was passed by the House of Commons on June 18 and the Senate on June 29 and given royal assent on the same day. The second omnibus bill was the Jobs and Growth Act (Bill C-45), introduced on October 18, 2012, by the Minister of Finance and adopted on December 14. The 443-page bill makes 65 amendments to 24 laws. Among the financial measures in the bill were the elimination of the Overseas Employment Tax Credit and corporate tax credits for mining exploration and development; moving the Atlantic Investment Tax Credit away from oil, gas, and mining towards electricity generation; making provisions for Pooled Registered Pension Plans; various amendments to Registered Disability Savings Plans, Retirement Compensation Arrangements, Employees Profit Sharing Plans, and thin capitalisation rules; reducing the Scientific Research and Experimental Development Tax Credit Program; adding a requirement that employers report as part of an employee's income any contributions to a group sickness or accident insurance plan; increasing the salaries of federal judges and making the income of the Governor General subject to income taxes. Non-financial measures added into the bill included a renaming of the Navigable Waters Protection Act to Navigation Protection Act and reduces its scope from all navigable waters to only 159 rivers and lakes, plus three oceans; creates the Bridge to Strengthen Trade Act which exempts a proposed new bridge between Windsor, Ontario and Detroit, Michigan from the Environmental Assessment Act, Fisheries Act, and the new Navigation Protection Act; eliminates the Merchant Seamen Compensation Board, the Hazardous Materials Information Review Commission, and the Canada Employment Insurance Financing Board. The portion of the bill that dealt with political pensions was taken out after first reading and re-introduced as the Pension Reform Act (Bill C-46). Fifteen private member bills had received royal assent. Six private member bills were adopted in 2012: * Geoff Regan's Purple Day Act (Bill C-278) designates March 26 as Purple Day * John Carmichael's National Flag of Canada Act (Bill C-288) encourages the display of flag of Canada on multiple-residence buildings and gated communities * Joy Smith's An Act to amend the Criminal Code (trafficking in persons) (Bill C-310) enables the prosecution of Canadians who engage in human trafficking while outside Canada * Dan Albas's An Act to amend the Importation of Intoxicating Liquors Act (interprovincial importation of wine for personal use) (Bill C-311) allows Canadians to import wine for personal use across provincial borders * Harold Albrecht's Federal Framework for Suicide Prevention Act (Bill C-300) requires the federal government to operate a program for suicide prevention * Patricia Davidson's An Act to amend the Food and Drugs Act (non-corrective contact lenses) (Bill C-313) makes cosmetic contact lenses subject to the Food and Drugs Act.

Five ministers were lost in the election to retirement or defeat. In the 18 May cabinet shuffle Harper promoted Steven Blaney, Ed Fast, Joe Oliver, Peter Penashue to ministerial positions, as well as promoting Denis Lebel and Julian Fantino from Minister of State roles to ministerial positions. He also promoted Bernard Valcourt, Tim Uppal, Alice Wong, Bal Gosal, and Maxime Bernier to Minister of State roles, replacing the two who had been promoted to Minister, one who had been defeated in the election, and Rob Merrifield and Rob Moore who were demoted. Upon the retirement of Bev Oda in July 2012, Harper promoted Julian Fantino to replace her as Minister for International Cooperation, with Bernard Valcourt replacing Fantino as Associate Minister. In preparing for the second session, Harper shuffled his cabinet in July 2013. Kellie Leitch, Chris Alexander, Shelly Glover and Kerry-Lynne Findlay were promoted to ministerial positions.

On May 18, 2011, two weeks after the election, Harper appointed Fabian Manning, Larry Smith, and Jos\u00e9e Verner, all of whom were defeated Conservative Party candidates in the general election. Manning and Smith had resigned from the Senate to run in the election and they became the first Senators to be reappointed to the Senate since John Carling in April 1896. On January 6, 2012, Harper appointed seven new Senators, all Conservative Party members: Alberta Senator-in-waiting Betty Unger, former police chief in the city of Ottawa Vernon White, former MP Norman Doyle, the 2011 Conservative Party nominee in Saint-Hyacinthe\u2014Bagot Jean-Guy Dagenais, as well as JoAnne Buth, Ghislain Maltais, and Asha Seth.

Of those who left the Senate during the 41st Parliament, 22 had reached the mandatory retirement age, including 12 Conservative Party members and one of the two remaining Progressive Conservatives. Three senators (Fred Dickson, Doug Finley, and Pierre Claude Nolin) died while in office. Of the remaining, 13 voluntarily resigned for various reasons, including 7 who had caucused with the Liberal Party and 6 with the Conservative Party. The Senate suspended three members (Mike Duffy, Pamela Wallin and Patrick Brazeau) for the remainder of the 41st Parliament after allegations of misuse of expense accounts was presented \u2014 evidence of misspending was also presented against Mac Harb but he voluntarily resigned before Senate could consider disciplinary measures. A comprehensive audit of all senator expenses was released in June 2015 which identified 21 senators who claimed and were paid for invalid expenses, amounting to $978,627. In addition to Duffy, Wallin, Brazeau and Harb, the audit recommended criminal investigations be conducted into the expense claims of 9 other senators who had served during the 41st Parliament. In January 2014, the Liberal Party removed its senate members from its national party caucus. From then on, the members and the new senate caucus were referred to as \"Independent Liberal\" and referred to themselves as the \"Senate Liberal Caucus\", though they were no longer formally affiliated with the Liberal Party of Canada. ==Members== :For full lists of members of the 41st Parliament of Canada, see List of House members of the 41st Parliament of Canada and List of senators in the 41st Parliament of Canada. ==Committees== ===House=== *Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development *Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics *Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food *Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage *Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration *Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development *Standing Committee on Finance *Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans *Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development *Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates *Standing Committee on Health *Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities *Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology *Standing Committee on International Trade *Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights *Standing Committee on National Defence *Standing Committee on Natural Resources *Standing Committee on Official Languages *Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs *Standing Committee on Public Accounts *Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security *Standing Committee on Status of Women *Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities *Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs ===Senate=== *Standing Committee on Aboriginal Peoples *Standing Committee on Agriculture and Forestry *Standing Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce *Standing Committee on Conflict of Interest for Senators *Standing Committee on Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources *Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans *Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade *Standing Committee on Human Rights *Standing Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration *Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs *Standing Committee on National Finance *Standing Committee on National Security and Defence **Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs *Standing Committee on Official Languages *Standing Committee on Rules, Procedures and the Rights of Parliament *Selection Committee *Standing Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology *Standing Committee on Transport and Communications ===Joint Committees=== *Standing Joint Committee on the Library of Parliament *Standing Joint Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations ==Officeholders== The current and former officers of Parliament during the 41st Parliament are set out below. ===Speakers=== * Speaker of the Senate of Canada: **Hon.
