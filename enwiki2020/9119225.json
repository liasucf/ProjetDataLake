    "text": "Carnacki the Ghost-Finder is a collection of occult detective short stories by English writer William Hope Hodgson. It was first published in 1913 by the English publisher Eveleigh Nash. In 1947, a new edition of 3,050 copies was published by Mycroft & Moran and included three additional stories (the last three listed below). In 1951 Ellery Queen covered the Mycroft & Moran version as No. 53 in Queen's Quorum: A History of the Detective-Crime Short Story As Revealed by the 100 Most Important Books Published in this Field Since 1845. For several decades subsequent to the Mycroft and Moran edition, Carnacki collections routinely if not always contained all nine stories. Project Gutenberg Ebook #10832 (2004) contains only the first six stories, however, and arranges them in sequence of their 1910 and 1912 magazine publication. Some other publications follow Project Gutenberg, perhaps using its text. ==Contents== Carnacki the Ghost-Finder contains the following tales: * \"The Gateway of the Monster\", the first story published, January 1910 * \"The House Among the Laurels\" * \"The Whistling Room\" * \"The Horse of the Invisible\" * \"The Searcher of the End House\" * \"The Thing Invisible\" * \"The Hog\" * \"The Haunted Jarvee\" * \"The Find\" ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * ==External links== * * * Category:1947 short story collections Category:Mystery short story collections Category:Single-writer horror short story collections Category:Short story collections by William Hope Hodgson ",
