He was awarded the Wright Brothers MedalList of Wright Brothers Medal recipients.Society of Automotive Engineers. Accessed June 2, 2008. Award citation: \"Development and Testing of a Microwave Powered Solid Waste Stabilization and Water Recovery System\" for his work on microwave powered methods for microbial stabilization and water recovery from solid waste. Atwater served in the United States Marine Corps [1963-1967] prior to attending the University of Utah [1968-1975]. In his early career [1977-1980] Atwater concentrated on methods and instrumentation for identification and quantification of radionuclides associated with uranium exploration and recovery by gamma ray and alpha particle energy spectrometry. Subsequently, [1980-1987] he applied radiometric geophysical well logging techniques to the characterization of sandstone, limestone, dolomite and shale core samples.Atwater, J.E., Spectrometric Gamma Ray Logging of Core, Canadian Well Logging Society Journal 13(1), 29-39, 1984.Matiisen, A., and Atwater, J.E., An Overview of Computer-Enhanced Analyses of Core Data, Journal of Canadian Petroleum Technology 23(3), 57-62, 1984.Atwater, J.E., Correlation of Cation Exchange Capacity with Core Spectral Gamma Ray Logs, SPWLA 27th Annual Logging Symposium, Paper QQ, pp 1\u201316, 1986.Codding, E.G., and Atwater, J.E., Application of Core Hydrocarbon Logging, Proceedings of the 37th Annual Technical Meeting of the Petroleum Society of CIM, Paper No. 86-37-20, pp 273\u2013284, 1986. At this time he also refined methods for the determination of porosity and permeability of unconsolidated bitumen and heavy oil bearing sands. Later Atwater's attention turned to problems of long-term human presence in space, working on regenerable systems for water and air purification,Atwater, J.E., and Holtsnider, J.T., Airborne Trace Organic Contaminant Removal Using Thermally Regenerable Multi-Media Layered Sorbents, SAE Transactions, Journal of Aerospace 100, 1726-1733, 1991.Atwater, J.E., Wheeler, R.R.,Jr., Olivadoti, J.T., Flanagan, D.T. and Sauer, R.L., Regenerable Microbial Check Valve: Life Cycle Tests Results, SAE Transactions, Journal of Aerospace 101, 1098-1107, 1992.Atwater, J.E., Thermodynamics of the Oxidation of Dissolved Organic Contaminants in Shuttle Orbiter Humidity Condensates, Journal of Environmental Science & Health A30 (4), 817-830, 1995.Schussel, L.J., and Atwater, J.E., A Continuous Alcohol Oxidase Bioreactor for Regenerative Life Support, Enzyme and Microbial Technology 18 (3), 229-235, 1996.Atwater, J.E., Holtsnider, J.T., Wheeler, R.R., Jr., and Luna, B., Microwave-Powered Thermal Regeneration of Sorbents for CO2, Water Vapor and Trace Organic Contaminants, SAE Technical Paper Series No. 972430, presented at 27th International Conference on Environmental Systems, Lake Tahoe, NV, July 14\u201317, 1997.Wheeler, R.R., Jr., Atwater, J.E., Akse, J.R., Holtsnider, J.T., and Luna, B., Development and Testing of a Microwave Powered Regenerable Air Purification Technology Demonstrator, SAE Technical Paper 2002-01-2403, presented at 32nd International Conference on Environmental Systems, San Antonio, Texas, July 15\u201318, 2002. and means for decomposition and stabilization of solid waste materials and recovery of useful resources therefrom.Sornchamni, T., Atwater, J.E., Akse, J.R., Wheeler, R.R., Jr., and Jovanovic, G.N., Magnetically Assisted Filtration for Solid Waste Separation and Concentration in Microgravity and Hypogravity, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research 44(24), 9199-9207, 2005.Atwater, J.E., Akse, J.R., Wheeler, R.R., Jr., Dahl, R.W., Hadley, N.M., Jovanovic, G.N., and Fisher, J.W., Magnetically Assisted Gasification of Solid Wastes: Comparison of Reaction Strategies, SAE Paper No. 2005-01-3081, presented 35th International Conference on Environmental Systems, Rome, July 11\u201314, 2005. During these years Atwater and colleagues also developed novel sensors and analytical instrumentation for monitoring and control of life support systems.Atwater, J.E., Wheeler, R.R., Jr., Sauer, R.L., and Schultz, J.R., A Multiplexed Four Channel On-Line Iodine Monitor, Instrumentation Science and Technology 22 (3), 217-229, 1994.Atwater, J.E., Akse, J.R., DeHart, J., and Wheeler, R.R., Jr., 'Reagentless ' Flow Analysis Determination of Hydrogen Peroxide by Electrocatalyzed Luminol Chemiluminescence, Analytical Letters 30 (1), 21-31, 1997.Atwater, J.E., Akse, J.R., DeHart, J., and Wheeler, R.R., Jr., Enzymatic Determination of Ethanol using 'Reagentless' Electrocatalyzed Luminol Chemiluminescence, Analytical Letters 30 (8), 1445-1453, 1997.

Recent research includes the study of multiphase immiscible fluid flow in porous media, and the recovery of hydrogen from methane (natural gas) using magnetically stabilized fluidized bed and microwave plasma reactors.Atwater, J.E., Wheeler, R.R., Jr., Hadley, N.M., Dahl, R.W., and Carrasquillo, R.L., Hydrogen Recovery by Methane Decomposition in a Microwave Plasma Reactor, SAE International Journal of Aerospace 1, 337-346, 2009. Though in retirement, Atwater continues his association with former colleagues, providing theoretical analysis of experimental data, and preparation of materials for publication. ==Family== Atwater is the son of noted avalanche control pioneer and author Montgomery Atwater; the grandson of Maxwell Atwater, the first mining engineer to employ flotation hydrometallurgy in North America; and the grandson of Mary Meigs Atwater, the \"Dean of American Hand Weaving\". ==References== Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American chemists Category:American geophysicists Category:Canadian geophysicists Category:Canadian chemists Category:Scientists from Salt Lake City Category:Wright Brothers Medal recipients Category:University of Utah alumni Category:State University of New York alumni Category:Scientists from Montana Category:Scientists from Alberta Category:Scientists from Oregon Category:People from Kalispell, Montana Category:20th-century American scientists Category:21st-century American scientists Category:20th-century Canadian scientists Category:United States Marines ",
