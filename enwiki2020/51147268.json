Surrounded by a paid gang, he moved to the parterre, giving the signal for applause for authors who had offered him some dinners or a few louis, and the signal for whistles against those from whom he had received nothing. In order to replace the whistle that the police did not always tolerate, he had imagined a sort of protracted yawn that produced a disastrous effect. Believing himself master of the theater, La Morli\u00e8re had the idea to use his means of action for his own account and wrote comedies but, despite all the efforts of his cabal, they fell, and with them his influence. Fr\u00e9ron, who he had attacked, gave him the final blow. Accused of baseness and cowardice and also of relations with the police, he was abandoned by everyone and ended his life in deep poverty. He was among the regulars of Marie Anne Doublet's salon. == Works (in French original)== *1746: Angola, histoire indienne, 2 vol. in-12, libertine novels reminding those of Cr\u00e9billon fils. *1748: Les Lauriers eccl\u00e9siastiques ou Campagnes de l\u2019abb\u00e9 de T\u2026, De l'Imprimerie ordinaire du clerg\u00e9, Luxuropolis (Paris), 1 vol. in-8. *1749: Mirza-Nadir ou M\u00e9moires et avantures du marquis de St. T***, gouverneur pour le roi de Perse de la ville du pays de Candahar, The Hague, 4 vol. in-12\u00b0 *1752: Observations sur la trag\u00e9die du duc de Faix, de M. de Voltaire, in-12\u00b0 *1754: Le Contrepoison des feuilles ou Lettres sur Fr\u00e9ron, in-12\u00b0 *1769: Le Fatalisme ou Collection d\u2019anecdotes pour prouver l\u2019influence du sort sur l\u2019histoire du c\u0153ur humain, work dedicated to Mme Du Barry, 2 vol. in-12\u00b0 His comedies in prose Le Gouverneur, three acts (1751), La Cr\u00e9ole, one act (1754) and L\u2019Amant d\u00e9guis\u00e9, two acts (1758) seem not to have been printed.
