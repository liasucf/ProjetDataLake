One of them is shortlisted for a $2.5 million grant that would enable the nonprofit to cover supply chains around the world, in partnership with news organizations such as The New York Times. The organization has also partnered with the Center for Investigative Reporting to look at a digital dumping ground, in China. Most recently, the Global Reporting Centre received funding from the Aga Khan Foundation to profile the efforts to wipe out Rh Disease and explore it as a public health issue. ==Awards and recognition== The Global Reporting Centre has won numerous awards for excellence in journalism in a range of categories.
