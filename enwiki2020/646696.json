Cajones are primarily played in Afro-Peruvian music (specifically m\u00fasica criolla), but has made its way into flamenco as well. The term caj\u00f3n is also applied to other box drums used in Latin American music, such as the Cuban caj\u00f3n de rumba and the Mexican caj\u00f3n de tapeo. ==Description== Sheets of 13 to 19 mm (1/2 to 3/4 inch) thick wood are generally used for five sides of the box. A thinner sheet of plywood is nailed on as the sixth side, and acts as the striking surface or head. The striking surface of the caj\u00f3n drum is commonly referred to as the tapa. A sound hole is cut on the back side. The modern caj\u00f3n may have rubber feet, and has several screws at the top for adjusting percussive timbre. Originally the instruments were only wooden boxes, but now they may have several stretched cords pressed against the top for a buzz-like effect, resembling a snare drum\u2014guitar strings, rattles or drum snares may serve this purpose. Bells may also be installed inside near the cords. == Origins and evolution == Street musician Heidi Joubert playing a decorated caj\u00f3n in London, England The caj\u00f3n is the most widely used Afro- Peruvian musical instrument since the late 16th century.Tompkins, William David: \"Afro-Peruvian Traditions\" in \"Music of the African Diaspora in the Americas,\" p. 493. Springer US Press, 2005 Slaves of west and central African origin in the Americas are considered to be the source of the caj\u00f3n drum. Currently, the instrument is common in musical performance throughout some of the Americas and Spain. The caj\u00f3n was developed during the periods of slavery in coastal Peru. The instrument reached a peak in popularity by 1850, and by the end of the 19th century caj\u00f3n players were experimenting with the design of the instrument by bending some of the planks in the caj\u00f3n's body to alter the instrument's patterns of sound vibration. After slavery the caj\u00f3n was spread to a much larger audience including Criollos. Given that the caj\u00f3n comes from slave musicians in the Spanish colonial Americas, there are two complementary origin theories for the instrument. It is possible that the drum is a direct descendant of a number of boxlike musical instruments from west and central Africa, especially Angola, and the Antilles. These instruments were adapted by slaves from the Spanish shipping crates at their disposal. In port cities like Matanzas, Cuba, codfish shipping crates and small dresser drawers became similar instruments. Peruvian musician and ethnomusicologist Susana Baca recounts her mother's story that the caj\u00f3n originated as \"the box of the people who carried fruit and worked in the ports,\" putting it down to play on whenever they had a moment. Another theory is that slaves used boxes as musical instruments to subvert Spanish colonial bans on music in predominantly African areas, essentially disguising their instruments. While early 20th century versions of the festejo appeared to have been performed without the caj\u00f3n, especially due to the influence of Per\u00fa Negro, a musical ensemble founded in 1969, the caj\u00f3n began to be more important than the guitar and, indeed, became \"a new symbol of Peruvian blackness\".Feldman p. 160. After a short 1980 visit and TV presentation in Lima along with Peruvian percussionist Caitro Soto, Spanish flamenco guitar player Paco de Luc\u00eda brought a caj\u00f3n to Spain to use it in his own music, after being impressed by the rhythmic possibilities of the instrument. In 2001, the caj\u00f3n was declared National Heritage by the Peruvian National Institute of Culture. In 2014, the Organization of American States declared the caj\u00f3n an \"Instrument of Peru for the Americas\". == Contemporary music == Example percussion setup, with caj\u00f3n replacing the bass drum In the 2000s (decade), the caj\u00f3n is heard extensively in Coastal Peruvian musical stylesFeldman, Heidi: \"Black Rhythms of Peru\". Wesleyan University Press, 2006 such as Tondero, Zamacueca and Peruvian Waltz, Spanish modern Flamenco and certain styles of modern Cuban Rumba. The modern caj\u00f3n is often used to accompany a solo acoustic guitar or piano. The caj\u00f3n is becoming rapidly popular in blues, pop, rock, funk, world music, jazz, etc. The caj\u00f3n is often used as a bass drum by bands instead of a full drum kit when performing in minimalist settings, as the caj\u00f3n can simultaneously serve as both a bass drum and a seat for the drummer. Though occasionally played by some bands in place of the ', the caj\u00f3n has not become a popular instrument in the folk music of Ireland, where the quieter and higher-pitched ' traditional frame drum serves the same purpose, and has a unique playing style. The caj\u00f3n also features in some Breton music. ==Playing styles == The player sits astride the box, tilting it at an angle while striking the head between their knees. The percussionist can play the sides with the top of their palms and fingers for additional sounds. Some percussionists attach a bass drum pedal to the instrument, enabling them to play it with a single foot. The instrument has been played not only with hands, but also with plastic and metal brushes, as used for drum kits. Another way of playing the caj\u00f3n is to use an ordinary bass drum pedal, thus turning the caj\u00f3n into an indirect percussion instrument which can be played with the feet. This enables the player to beat it just like a pedal-bass drum, thus leaving the hands (and one other foot) free to play other instruments. On the other hand, it also restricts the player's standard caj\u00f3n-playing position, as when the caj\u00f3n is placed on the ground, in the bass drum location, it is hard for the performer to slap it with her or his hands. == Gallery == ==Notable caj\u00f3n players== * Yoon Dowoon == See also == * Afro-Peruvian music * Jawbone (instrument) * Festejo ==References== ==External links== *How to Build a Caj\u00f3n Category:Peruvian musical instruments Category:South American percussion instruments Category:Percussion vessels Category:Unpitched percussion Category:Struck idiophones played by hand ",
