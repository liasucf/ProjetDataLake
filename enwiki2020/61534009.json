Bree Runway was signed to Virgin EMI Records in 2018 after the release of single \"What Do I Tell My Friends?\" and consequently released the EP, Be Runway in August 2019. Preceded by the singles; \"Apeshit\", \"Damn Daniel\" with Yung Baby Tate, \"Gucci\" with Maliibu Miitch and \"Little Nokia\", Runway's debut mixtape is scheduled for a 2020 release. == Early life == Bree Runway grew up in Hackney, residing on a street given the nickname \"Murder mile\" due to high rates of crime and conflict. Runway views her upbringing and experiences as her having to have \"thick skin\", resilience and \"having instilled a fight in me\" which she is thankful for. At the age of 9, Runway experienced bullying and colorism which caused her to bleach her skin and have a negative chemical reaction to the product. Runway credits those moments as shaping her both as a person and an artist. Runway discussed the positive shift in attitude regarding her skin when she went to a college in south London where she met model Leomie Anderson who encouraged Runway to take pictures of herself and \"take charge of our situations\". Runway disclosed that she was only interested in music at school but never thought of herself as a musician. She enrolled in a Music technology subject which taught her the basics of music production. As a result, Runway started making beats and freestyling with her friends. Runway discussed that she purchased a \"DIY home studio\" setup with her first pay cheque which was where she was singing over self-produced beats and writing her own songs. Earlier material such as RNWY 01 was recorded with her DIY setup and explained that the self-sufficiency taught her what musical sound she wanted to pursue. Runway revealed that Former First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, once visited her school where she performed for her and was told to keep pursuing a musical career and that she wanted to see her performing at the White House to which Runway responded \"Invite me then!\" ==Career== === 2015-2019: Career beginnings and Be Runway === Bree Runway would emerge onto the music scene with the self-released EPs titled RNWY 01 and Bouji being released on November 28, 2015 and May 9, 2016 respectively.
