Lee (born May 30, 1943) is an American politician who served in the Oregon House of Representatives from 2001 until 2003. ==Biography== Lee was born in Santa Barbara, California in 1943. She graduated from Linfield College in 1982, and received a Master of Public Administration from Lewis & Clark College in 1989. Lee served on the board of the Clackamas Soil and Water Conservation District from 1999 until 2000. She was elected to the Oregon House in 2000 as a Republican, but switched to become an Independent in June 2001. Regarding her switch, she stated, \"There is still strong partisanship that stands in the way of bringing people together in the middle to form workable solutions. You cannot force someone to follow hard-line conservative beliefs that do not serve their community and do not reflect their values.\" She later switched to the Democratic party, and ran as a Democrat for the 51st district in the 2002 elections, where she was defeated by Linda Flores. On June 4, 2018, Lee was appointed to a vacant seat on the Sandy City Council. ==Personal life== Lee is divorced, and has one child. She resides in Sandy, Oregon. ==See also== * List of American politicians who switched parties in office ==References== Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:Lewis & Clark College alumni Category:Linfield University alumni Category:Members of the Oregon House of Representatives Category:Oregon Democrats Category:Oregon Independents Category:Oregon Republicans Category:Politicians from Oregon City, Oregon Category:People from Santa Barbara, California Category:Women state legislators in Oregon Category:American Lutherans Category:21st-century American politicians Category:21st-century American women politicians ",
