    "text": "Barry Neufeld is a school trustee in Chilliwack, BC. Neufeld was elected in December 1993 with his first term ending in December 2008. He was re-elected in December 2011. Neufeld has been criticized for making bigoted and discriminatory remarks towards the LGBTQ+ community, and in May 2020, he was accused of disparaging the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada Dr. Theresa Tam, a story that made international headlines. Neufeld first made headlines in 2017 for comparing gender transitioning to child abuse. His comments attracted widespread media attention, a court filing by the Canadian Union of Public Employees, and a vocal exchange with political and human rights defender Morgane Oger. The superintendent of School District 33 Chilliwack, Evelyn Novak, responded saying Neufeld did not speak for the Board on that issue. The Chilliwack School Teachers Association passed a vote of non- confidence in 2017. The Chilliwack Board of Education passed a motion asking Neufeld to resign and the Ministry of Education issued a statement. In 2019, Neufeld's defamation lawsuit against British Columbia Teachers' Federation (BCTF) president Glen Hansman was dismissed in British Columbia\u2019s first use of 'anti-SLAPP' (Strategic lawsuit against public participation) legislation. Neufeld has complained other trustees treated him \"like a dirty old man\". == References == Category:Living people Category:People from Chilliwack Category:British Columbia school board members ",
