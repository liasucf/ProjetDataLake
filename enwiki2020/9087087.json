Later people moved to there for agricultural work. When the community grew bigger, the government created the Ta Phraya minor district (king amphoe) in 1959. It was upgraded to a full district in 1963. This district gives its name to Ta Phraya National Park. ==Geography== Neighboring districts are (from the south clockwise), Khok Sung and Watthana Nakhon of Sa Kaeo Province, Non Din Daeng and Lahan Sai of Buriram Province. To the east is Banteay Meanchey Province of Cambodia.
