To the west, the street heads to a former Jewish quarter, hence its former name, \u017bydowska Street (Ulica \u017bydowska, lit. Jewish Street). Historically, the street saw the location of a synagogue, cemetery and a Jewish bath house until the fifteenth-century, when the Jewish population was moved to the north to the present location of Szczepa\u0144ski Square. The etymology of the street derives from the presence of the Church of St. Anne. The street features several university-related buildings, formerly housing colleges, dormitories and a library. ==Features== {| |----- bgcolor=\"#FF 8C 00\" ! width=4% | Street No. ! width=26% | Short description ! width=10% | Picture |----- bgcolor=\"#FFF8E1\" | align=\"center\"| 6 || align=\"center\"| Collegium Ko\u0142\u0142\u0105taj - a Classicist building built between 1787 and 1791 to house the mathematics, nature, mechanics and hydraulics classes of the Jagiellonian University. || align=\"center\"| 100px |----- bgcolor=\"#FFF8E1\" | align=\"center\"| 8-10 || align=\"center\"| Collegium Maius - the oldest building of the Jagiellonian University, standing in the very centre of the former university quarter. || align=\"center\"| 100px |----- bgcolor=\"#FFF8E1\" | align=\"center\"| 12 || align=\"center\"| Collegium Novum - housing the Jagiellonian University Medical College built between 1873 and 1887.
