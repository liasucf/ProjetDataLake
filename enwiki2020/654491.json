    "text": "San Sebasti\u00e1n () is a municipality of Puerto Rico located in the northwestern region of the island, south of Isabela, Quebradillas and Camuy; north of Las Mar\u00edas; east of Moca and A\u00f1asco; and west of Lares. San Sebasti\u00e1n is spread over twenty-four barrios and San Sebasti\u00e1n Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is a principal city of the Aguadilla- Isabela-San Sebasti\u00e1n Metropolitan Statistical Area. == History == 1929 map of San Sebasti\u00e1n The permission to found the town was officially given in 1752, under the leadship of the founder, Captain Crist\u00f3bal Gonz\u00e1lez de la Cruz, who among other neighbors had an interest in converting some cow farms into an agricultural village. The foundation of the town from the religious aspect, was consummated in December 1762 by Mariano Martin, the island catholic bishop at that time. At the beginning, by 1700, San Sebasti\u00e1n was a conglomerate of a few cow farms, owned by some residents of the Partido de Aguada. Las Vegas was the former plain site of one of the first cow farms located by the Guatemala riverside at the north. Also, another of those cow farms was Pepinito (today's downtown) that was a low green mountain with a white calcium carbonate face. On the north side of the town it can be seen some of this \"pepinos\" (cucumbers). These two cow farms gave the town its first name. From these geographical accidents come the first names of the new village: Las Vegas del Pepino (Cucumber Fields). In 1865 it is documented as San Sebasti\u00e1n de Las Vegas del Pepino. At the beginning of the 19th century, wealthy Spanish families arrived in Pepino, fleeing the revolutions of Venezuela and the Dominican Republic. Later, by 1850, several families from Catalonia and the Basque Country in Spain joined the large number of isle\u00f1os (Canary Islanders) that had made El Pepino their home. These people, after taking over the local political power, developed a coffee industry and brought some material progress to the town. The resident Basques in the municipality, in remembrance of their home region and its religious patron, saw the need of upgrading the old traditional Pepino used by the Canary Islanders to the new and \"up-dated\" San Sebasti\u00e1n, promoted and thus got the name formally changed by the central government authority. Nevertheless, the citizens of San Sebasti\u00e1n are called \"pepinianos\". San Sebasti\u00e1n M\u00e1rtir (Spanish for Saint Sebastian the Martyr) is the patron saint of archers and was chosen to be the patron saint of the town since its early history, first brought by the immigrants from the Canaries and later confirmed by the Basques, with the town name changed in 1869. ===Hurricane Maria=== Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in San Sebasti\u00e1n with the significant amount of rainfall. The hurricane winds knocked all the power out and the town was left in the dark. The 40,000 residents of San Sebasti\u00e1n were left without electrical power. Two weeks after the hurricane decimated the island, Javier Jim\u00e9nez, the mayor at the time, noticed that help was not on the way. He decided that San Sebasti\u00e1n would not wait for the AEE brigades to come. He assembled an ad hoc team of volunteers, some who were retired AEE electricians, set safety protocols, and their mandate was to get the electrical power back up and running for the people of San Sebasti\u00e1n. Four months after the hurricane, they had restored power to 2,500 homes and continued to do about 60 homes each day. A monument honoring the accomplishments of the Pepino Power Authority, as they were quickly named, was erected in Plaza de la Identidad Pepiniana in San Sebasti\u00e1n barrio-pueblo. ==Geography== San Sebasti\u00e1n is on the northwest. ===Water features=== * Guajataca Lake * R\u00edo Grande de A\u00f1asco * R\u00edo Culebrinas * R\u00edo Guajataca ===Barrios=== Subdivisions of San Sebasti\u00e1n Like all municipalities of Puerto Rico, San Sebasti\u00e1n is subdivided into barrios.
