In total, Fodor has three biological siblings as well as three adopted siblings, and one of his adopted brothers Ben Fodor aka Phoenix Jones is also a mixed martial artist. Fodor competed in high school wrestling at Shoreline High School, during his senior year to help prepare himself for boot camp, as he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps six days after his graduation. While he was in boot camp, the terrorist attacks of 9/11 occurred and Fodor was sent to Kuwait for the Iraq invasion. Fodor ended his stint in the military in 2007, reaching the ranks of Sergeant. ==Mixed martial arts career== ===Early career=== After an extensive, successful amateur career in which he was the Genesis Fights MMA and Muay Thai Champion and Revolution Submission Champion, Fodor turned professional in 2008 and won his first two fights, with both wins coming by guillotine choke submission.

He returned to the organization on their Strikeforce Challengers: Wilcox vs. Ribeiro card. He defeated Derek Getzel via submission due to a d'arce choke. Fodor then faced off against David Douglas at Strikeforce Challengers: Wilcox vs. Damm on April 1. After dominating the first two rounds he stopped Douglas in the third by TKO due to multiple knee strikes. Fodor's next fight was against James Terry in the main event at Strikeforce Challengers 16.
