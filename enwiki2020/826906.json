    "text": "In philately, a Coronation issue is an issue of postage stamps made by the British Post Office and the Post Offices of Commonwealth countries and British dependencies to celebrate the coronation of a new monarch. These stamps are often considerably more ornate and detailed than definitive issue stamps generated by the same jurisdictions; as such they are greatly favored by many collectors. A particularly favored approach is to attempt to gather all such stamps issued in honor of a particular monarch by all of the jurisdictions issuing them. As Elizabeth II has been the British monarch for over half a century and hers is to date the last event so commemorated, there are no recent \"Coronation issue\" stamps as envisioned here. However, other monarchies also issue stamps honouring the accession of a new monarch and these stamps could obviously be defined as \"coronation issues\" as well. 1937 Coronation issue File:Falkland Islands Coronation Stamp.jpg|Falkland Islands File:Timbre NZ AvenementG6 2hp 1937.jpg|New Zealand File:Turks and Caicos Islands 1937 coronation stamp.jpg|Turks and Caicos Islands 1953 Coronation issue Image:GB Elizabeth Coronation Stamp.jpg|Great Britain File:Australianstamp 1608.jpg|Australia File:Malta-Queen-Elizabeth-II-Coronation- Stamp-1953.jpg|Malta Category:Postage stamps of the United Kingdom Category:Topical postage stamps ",
