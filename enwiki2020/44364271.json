    "text": "Phenaglycodol (brand names Acalmid, Acalo, Alterton, Atadiol, Felixyn, Neotran, Pausital, Remin, Sedapsin, Sinforil, Stesil, Ultran) is a drug described as a tranquilizer or sedative which has anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties. It is related structurally and pharmacologically to meprobamate, though it is not a carbamate. ==Synthesis== Eli Lilly Co.). p-Chloroacetophenone and NaCN are reacted together to give the corresponding cyanohydrin (cf Strecker synthesis). The cyano group is then hydrated in acid to the corresponding amide, thus p-chloroatrolactamide (4) is formed. The amide group is then further hydrolyzed with a 2nd equivalent of water in concentrated lye to p-chloroatrolactic acid (5); this is then esterified to Ethyl p-chloroatrolactate (6). Finally, nucleophilic addition a couple of equivalents of MeMgI are added to the ester give Phenaglycodol (7) crystals. ===Notes=== *See \"Novel trifluoromethyl derivatives of substituted diols\" also. ==See also== * Metaglycodol * Fenpentadiol ==References== Category:Anticonvulsants Category:Anxiolytics Category:Sedatives ",
