    "text": "The Sapphic stanza is the only stanzaic form adapted from Greek and Latin poetry to be used widely in Polish literature. It was introduced during the Renaissance, and since has been used frequently by many prominent poets. The importance of the Sapphic stanza for Polish literature lies not only in its frequent use, but also in the fact that it formed the basis of many new strophes, built up of hendecasyllables (11-syllable lines) and pentasyllables (5-syllable lines). ==Metrical components== ===Classical models=== The stanza comes from classical Greece, but it was the Romans, especially Horace, who provided the chief models for Renaissance poets. Horace's Sapphic stanza comprised three \"lesser sapphics\" and an \"adonic\": \u2013 u \u2013 x \u2013 u u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 x \u2013 u u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 x \u2013 u u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 = long syllable; u = short syllable; x = anceps: either long or short ===Polish verse=== In Polish there was no quantitative verse, as phonemic quantity itself was extinct. Nor was there accentual-syllabic versification, save some attempts by Jan Kochanowski. But Polish syllabic lines were available. A syllabic hendecasyllable 11(5+6) took the place of the quantitative lesser sapphic; likewise with the adonic. Quantitative Lesser Sapphic: \u2013 u \u2013 x \u2013 u u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 Syllabic Polish Hendecasyllable: o o o S s | o o o o S s Quantitative Adonic: \u2013 u u \u2013 \u2013 Polish Pentasyllable: o o o S s o = any syllable; S = stressed syllable; s = unstressed syllable; | = caesura The hendecasyllable (with caesura after the fifth syllable) is very common in Polish poetry, and the pentasyllable is so typical for Polish verse that Karol Wiktor Zawodzi\u0144ski gave it the name of polonik.Micha\u0142 G\u0142owi\u0144ski, Teresa Kostkiewiczowa, Aleksandra Okopie\u0144-S\u0142awi\u0144ska, Janusz S\u0142awi\u0144ski, S\u0142ownik termin\u00f3w literackich, Wroc\u0142aw 2002 (polonik). Pentasyllables occur in Polish poetry either in a long series of corresponding lines, or in combination with other metrical lines. They can also form a part- line within the metrical patterns of longer lines, such as: 8(5+3), 9(5+4), 10(5+5), 11(5+6), 12(5+7), 12(7+5), 13(8+5), and even 15(5+5+5) and 20(5+5+5+5). ==The Renaissance== The Renaissance was the epoch when Polish literature became a great one.Andrzej Borowski wrote a monograph about Polish literature of 16th century: Andrzej Borowski, Renesans, Wydanie pierwsze, Wydawnictwa Szkolne i Pedagodgiczne, Warszawa 1992. Polish poets of the time were well educated, mainly in Italy, knew Latin and sometimes Greek, and worked hard on building a new Polish literature. Many authors wrote in Latin, while some tried to create a modern Polish literary language. As in other European literatures, Polish poets often looked to Greek and Roman literature as a model. Jan Kochanowski, the most prominent of a family of poets, wrote lyrical poems, often in imitation of Horace. The classic Polish Sapphic stanza was thus 11(5+6) / 11(5+6) / 11(5+6) / 5, typically rhymed a a b b. Jan Kochanowski used this Sapphic stanza several times in his Cantos, Laments, and Psalms. An excellent example is Lament XVI. Miko\u0142aj S\u0119p-Szarzy\u0144ski, who was the author of Rymy, abo wiersze polskie (The rhymes or Polish poems) and Sebastian Grabowiecki, who was the author of Setnik rym\u00f3w duchownych (Spiritual Rhymes) also used Sapphic stanzas in their lyrical pieces. Sebastian Fabian Klonowic (known as Acernus) decided to employ the stanza in a longer epic poem. His Flis, to Jest Spuszczanie Statk\u00f3w Wis\u0142\u0105 i inszymi rzekami (The lightening or expediting barges on the Vistula river and other rivers) is because of its stanzaic form an exceptional work, perhaps not only in Polish literature. The whole poem is 471 stanzas long and probably no other work can be compared to it. Tobiasz Wiszniowski, who wrote his own sequence of Laments, employed Sapphic stanza in Tren XVII (Lament XVII).Tobiasz Wiszniowski, Treny. Opracowa\u0142 Jacek W\u00f3ycicki, Wydawnictwo Neriton, Warszawa 2008. ==The Baroque== At the beginning of the Baroque, Kasper Miaskowski employed the Sapphic stanza in some poems. Olbrycht Karmanowski, a minor poet, employed it in the poem O \u015bmierci (On Death). Lenart Gnoi\u0144ski used Sapphic stanzas in the tenth poem of a sequence named \u0141zy smutne (Sorrowful Tears). Daniel Naborowski, a Calvinist poet, employed the Sapphic stanza in Lament I from Laments on Death of Duke Radziwi\u0142\u0142, Castellan of Vilnius. The poem consists of eleven strophes.See: Treny na \u015bmier\u0107 ksiecia Radziwi\u0142\u0142a, kasztelana wile\u0144skiego. Tren I [in:] Daniel Naborowski, Poezje wybrane. Wyboru dokona\u0142 i opracowa\u0142 Krzysztof Karasek, Ludowa Sp\u00f3\u0142dzielnia Wydawnicza, Warszawa 1980, p. 118-119. Jan Andrzej Morsztyn, whose poetry (influenced strongly by Giambattista Marino) is most typical for Baroque, used Sappho's stanza in Do lutnie (To a Lute) from Lutnia (The Lute) and in Wiejski \u017cywot (Life in a Village from the book Kaniku\u0142a, albo psia gwiazda (Canicula or dog star). Zbigniew Morsztyn shaped his Sapphic stanzas so as to make a long chain of linked strophes, exhibiting many enjambments from one to the next stanza.Lucylla Pszczo\u0142owska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc\u0142aw 1997, p. 115. He is the author of the poem S\u0142awna wiktoryja nad Turkami (The Famous Victory over the Turks), which is an example of the use of the Sapphic stanza in an epic function.Lucylla Pszczo\u0142owska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc\u0142aw 1997, p. 111. Large parts of Klemens Boles\u0142awiusz's Przera\u017aliwe echo tr\u0105by ostatecznej (The Horrifying Echo of Doomsday Trumpet) are composed in Sapphic stanzas.See: Klemens Boles\u0142awiusz, Przera\u017aliwe echo tr\u0105by ostatecznej. Wyda\u0142 Jacek Sokolski, Instytut Bada\u0144 Literackich, Warszawa 2004. This work, which can be compared to The Revelation of St. John or Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, was extremely popular and appeared in eighteen editions from 1670 to 1886. It is another example of the Sapphic stanza serving an epic function in Old Polish literature. ==The Enlightenment== The Sapphic stanza was also used in Poland during Enlightenment. Poets of the time preferred the Polish alexandrine (7+6) to the hendecasyllable (5+6), but used the latter metre in Italian forms, such as sesta rima and ottava rima, as well as in Sappho's stanza. Sapphic stanzas can be found in Adam Naruszewicz's poetry. He used the form among others in the poem Pie\u015b\u0144 doroczna na dzie\u0144 ocalenia \u017cycia i zdrowia J. K. Mo\u015bci (Annual song for the day of rescuing life and health of His Majesty, the King). He also employed it in the poem \"Piesek\" (\"A little dog\"). Franciszek Karpi\u0144ski made use of the analysed formLucylla Pszczo\u0142owska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc\u0142aw 1997, p.157. in Psalm 8. O wielko\u015bci Boga (Psalm 8. On God's grandeur). He repeated it in the Psalmu 64 cz\u0119\u015b\u0107. O opatrzno\u015bci (Part of Psalm 64. On Providence) and in the poem Pie\u015b\u0144 do \u015bwi\u0119tych Polak\u00f3w, patron\u00f3w Polski (Hymn to the holy Poles, patrons of Poland). Another poet, Franciszek Dionizy Knia\u017anin used Sappho's stanza very frequently.Lucylla Pszczo\u0142owska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc\u0142aw 1997, p. 157. Another example of Sapphic stanza is a hymn included in Gorzkie \u017cale (Bitter Lamentations), a typically Polish Catholic devotion, sung in churches on Sundays during Lent, and familiar to many Poles. ==Romanticism== Neither Adam Mickiewicz nor Juliusz S\u0142owacki used the classic Sapphic stanza.Lucylla Pszczo\u0142owska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc\u0142aw 1997, p. 222. S\u0142owacki, however, employed its general scheme in his own six-line stanza, discussed below. Cyprian Kamil Norwid, a poet regarded as one of the greatest Polish authors and perhaps the most modern of the poets of the 19th century, used Sapphic stanzas in the poem named Trzy zwrotki (Three strophes), as well as in many other poemsLucylla Pszczo\u0142owska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc\u0142aw 1997, p. 223. including Sieroctwo (Orphanhood). Sometimes he implemented the scheme freely, as in the poem Buntowniki (Rioters). ==Second half of the 19th century== The second half of the 19th century in Polish literature was dominated by pozytywizm (positivism), which was the local Polish version of West-European realism. The two greatest poets of the time were Adam Asnyk and Maria Konopnicka. Their poetry was much influenced by French Parnassianism. Maria Konopnicka published more than twenty poems written in the form. She also used its scheme for constructing more complicated stanzas. Felicjan Fale\u0144ski attempted a Polish Sapphic stanza more closely resembling the Greek and Latin models, and in translating Horace's poetry used a hendecasyllable with the caesura after the fourth, not the fifth syllable.Kazimierz W\u00f3ycicki, Forma d\u017awi\u0119kowa prozy polskiej i wiersza polskiego, E. Wende i S-ka, Warszawa 1912, p. 211. His Sapphic stanzas influenced the Czech poet Jaroslav Vrchlick\u00fd. Also Kazimierz Wroczy\u0144ski tried to imitate Greek rhythm in his poem Strofa Safony (Sappho's strophe).Lucylla Pszczo\u0142owska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc\u0142aw 1997, p. 287. His stanza is composed of three lines of SsSsSsSSsSs and one of SssSs. The SsSsSsSSsSs scheme is just a trochaic hexameter (SsSsSsSsSsSs) with the eighth syllable omitted. For comparison to Horace's standard: Horace: \u2013 u \u2013 x \u2013 u u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 Wroczy\u0144ski: S s S s S s S S s S s (\u00d73) Horace: \u2013 u u \u2013 \u2013 Wroczy\u0144ski: S s s S s ==20th century== In the 20th century classic strophes went out of use together with regular verse. Jaros\u0142aw Iwaszkiewicz used Sapphic stanza in the poem Marzec w Pary\u017cu (March in Paris). It is composed of four stanzas and three are Sapphic ones. Only the last one is made up of four hendecasyllabic lines. All strophes rhyme ABAB. The Sapphic stanza is still used in translations form Sappho's or Horace's poems. The scheme of Sapphic stanza is so recognizable, that it can be preserved even in free verse. Lucylla Pszczo\u0142owska points out that Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz sometimes composed four-line stanzas with last line of five syllables and other lines of different length.Lucylla Pszczo\u0142owska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc\u0142aw 1997, p. 329. ==Other forms derived from the Sapphic stanza== The Sapphic stanza's scheme was so attractive to Polish poets that they started to modify it, and many stanzas based on it can be found in Polish literature. Already in the 16th century Jan Kochanowski created a three-line stanza, being just a shortened Sapphic stanza (11/11/5), and used it in his Psalm 34.Lucylla Pszczo\u0142owska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc\u0142aw 1997, p. 64. Much later Kochanowski's proposal was used by Cyprian Kamil Norwid in his famous poem Co\u015b ty Atenom zrobi\u0142, Sokratesie? (What Did You Do to Athens, Socrates?) Juliusz S\u0142owacki, a romantic poet, frequently used a sexain rhyming a b a b c c, and invented a stanza using this rhyme scheme but suggesting the Sapphic stanza in its metre: 11a/11b/11a/5b/11c/5c.Wiktor Jaros\u0142aw Darasz, Ma\u0142y przewodnik po wierszu polskim, Towarzystwo Mi\u0142o\u015bnik\u00f3w J\u0119zyka Polskiego, Krak\u00f3w 2003, p. 145-146. It is also possible that S\u0142owacki was inspired by the well- known Burns stanza which also consists of four longer lines (iambic tetrameters) and two shorter (iambic dimeters): But Mousie, thou art no thy- lane, In proving foresight may be vain: The best laid schemes o\u2019 Mice an\u2019 Men Gang aft agley, An\u2019 lea\u2019e us nought but grief an\u2019 pain, For promis\u2019d joy! Maria Konopnicka used S\u0142owacki's stanza in her well-known poem with the Latin title \"Contra spem spero\", and in the poems \"Do ziemi\" (\"To the soil\") and in \"Zima do poety\" (\"Winter to the poet\"). In another poem, \"Jej pami\u0119ci\" (\"To her memory\"), she employed a very similar strophe, also 11/11/11/5/11/5, but rhymed AABBCC. In the lyric \"Preludium\" (\"Prelude\") she employed a seven-line stanza, built in much the same way: 11a/11b/11a/11a/5b/11c/5c. Once again she suggested Sappho's stanzaic pattern in the poem \"Pos\u0142om wielkopolskim\" (\"To the deputies from the Greater Poland\"), which goes 11a/11b/11a/5b/11c/11c; she repeated this scheme in \"Improwizacja\" (\"Improvisation\") and in \"Ave, Patria\". In the poem \"Id\u017a, id\u017a w pokoju!\" (\"Go away in peace\") Konopnicka used a six- line strophe 5a/11b/11b/11c/11c/5a. Another form used by Konopnicka suggestive of the Sapphic stanza is a quatrain composed of three hendecasyllabic lines and one trisyllable,Lucylla Pszczo\u0142owska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc\u0142aw 1997, p. 262. used in \"Kto krzywd\u0119 p\u0142odzi\" (\"Who begets harm\"). More complicated is an eight-line stanza 11/11/11/5/11/11/11/3 (rhymed ABABCCAB), as was employed in the \"W Porta Pia\" (\"In Porta Pia\"). Another form developed by Konopnicka is the five-line strophe including decasyllabic lines and masculine rhymes: 10m/5f/10m/10m/5f, used in \"Kt\u00f3rzy idziemy\" (\"We that are going\"). Adam Asnyk wrote an epigram (Italian strambotto) \"Ironia\" (\"Irony\") in the form of ottava rima with the last line being a pentasyllable. He also often combined octosyllables with a pentasyllable, making a quasi-Sapphic stanza of 8/8/8/5. He was not the first poet to use such a stanza, being preceded by Franciszek Dionizy Knia\u017anin and by the Romantic poet Kazimierz Brodzi\u0144ski.Lucylla Pszczo\u0142owska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc\u0142aw 1997, p. 191. There are also more unusual forms. Jerzy Szlichting, a poet from 17th century, in his Pie\u015b\u0144 (Song) made Sapphic-like strophe 13(8+5)a/13(8+5)a/16(8b+8b)/5x. It is an example of stanza with internal rhymes. The strophe is built of segments of five or eight syllables. ==References== Category:Polish poetry Category:Stanzaic form ",
