    "text": "Knut Monrad (March 14, 1913 \u2013 June 23, 1987) was a Norwegian painter. He has been described as a nature poet that interpreted his experience of nature with rapid, broad brushstrokes.Norsk kunstnerleksikon: Knut Monrad. In addition to his activity as a painter, Monrad also worked as a translator of English and Swedish literature. Monrad was born in Vestre Aker, the son of Hans Sundt Monrad and Astrid Haslum.Norske malerier: katalog. 1992. Oslo: Nasjonalgalleriet, p. 331. He studied at the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry under Karl H\u00f8gberg and at the Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts under Jean Heiberg. During the Second World War he studied in Bjarne Engebret's painting school. He began his artistic path relatively late, and he consistently displayed subdued naturalistic expression. Landscapes drawn in broad strokes with a view across the land or sea were his main motif. He often used a limited range of color, with gray or blue-tinted coloring interspersed with green and gray shades. He participated in 42 exhibitions from 1952 to 1980. Among group exhibitions, he took part in the Autumn Exhibition eight times from 1947 to 1972, twice in the Southern Norway Exhibition (, in 1972 and 1978), and once in the Eastern Norway Exhibition (, in 1979). He also participated in the Young Artists Society's anniversary exhibition (1975). Monrad was part of the artists' colony that developed in Flosta after the Second World War. Together with artists such as Ferdinand Finne, Ellen Iden, Ivar Jerven, Kjerstin \u00d8vrelid, Liv Nergaard, Finn Str\u00f8msted, Bodil Cappelen, and Finn Henrik Bodvin, an artistic environment was created that drew inspiration from nature and the skerries.Opstad, Gunvald. 1991. S\u00f8rlandet og malerne. Oslo: Aschehoug, p. 211. Many of Monrad's motifs are drawn from impressions of nature in Flosta, Trom\u00f8y, and Ytre M\u00f8kkalasset Lighthouse. Monrad was married twice, to Eva Eriksen and Live Hiorth. He died in B\u00e6rum. ==References== Category:1913 births Category:1987 deaths Category:20th-century Norwegian painters Category:Norwegian male painters Category:20th-century male artists ",
