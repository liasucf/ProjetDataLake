    "text": "Example of a county route marker used by Nassau County for its county routes prior to the mid-1970s. County routes in Nassau County, New York are maintained by the Nassau County Public Works Department. Route numbers were originally posted on unique blue-on-orange pentagonal route markers reflecting the county's official colors; however, all county route signage was removed in the mid-1970s after the federal government enacted new standards for county route markers in 1973. The county legislature refused to allocate funds to replace the signs with new markers conforming to the federal government's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, leaving the routes unsigned. The route numbers are still used by the county for internal purposes only. __TOC__ ==Routes== Route numbers, lengths, and termini are derived from the New York State Department of Transportation's county road listing for Nassau County unless otherwise noted. As information on Nassau County routes is limited, the following list is likely incomplete. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! width=7% | Route ! width=4% | Length (mi) ! width=4% | Length (km) ! width=20% class=\"unsortable\" | From ! width=30% class=\"unsortable\" | Via ! width=20% class=\"unsortable\" | To ! width=15% class=\"unsortable\" | Notes |- | id=\"1\" | | | Dead end in Point Lookout | Lido Boulevard, East Park Street, Long Beach Boulevard, Austin Boulevard, Long Beach Road, Greenwich Street, Henry Street, Clinton Street, Glen Cove Road, Glen Cove Avenue, Bridge Street, School Street, Forest Avenue, Skunks Misery Road, Lattingtown Road, Bayville Road, Bayville Avenue, Centre Island Road |Centre Island village line | Becomes NY 900B north of Glen Cove Road. |- |CR 1A | -
