    "text": ":Not to be confused with Arthur Pereyre. Isaac La Peyr\u00e8re (1596\u20131676), also known as Isaac de La Peyr\u00e8re or Pererius, was a French-born theologian, writer and lawyer. La Peyr\u00e8re is best known as a 17th century predecessor of the scientific racialist theory of polygenism in the form of his Pre-Adamite hypothesis, which offered a challenge to traditional Abrahamic understandings of the descent of the human races as derived from the Book of Genesis. In addition to this, La Peyr\u00e8re anticipated Zionism, advocating a Jewish return to Palestine, within the context of premillennialist Messianic theology. He moved in prominent circles and was known for his connections to the Prince of Cond\u00e9 and abdicated Queen Christina of Sweden. Born to a Hugenot family of Portuguese Jewish converso or Marrano heritage, La Peyr\u00e8re was pressured to renounce his views and publically converted to the Catholic Church towards the end of his life, though the sincerity of this conversion has been questioned. ==Biography== ===Background=== La Peyr\u00e8re was born in Bordeaux to a nominally Calvinist Hugenot family of Portuguese New Christian (converted Sephardic Jewish) ancestry. Retrieved on 20 March 2018. His name is sometimes given in Latin as \"Pererius\", which is a version of Pereira. He was born to a socially prominent family to parents Bernard La Peyr\u00e8re and Marthre Malet, with eight siblings, including his brother Abraham La Peyr\u00e8re. His father was the private secretary to Jacques II de Goyon de Matignon, Mar\u00e9chal de France, while on his mother's side, his grandfather was General Treasurer to the Royal House of Navarre. Retrieved on 20 March 2018. La Peyr\u00e8re was a lawyer by training. ===Cond\u00e9 and Christina of Sweden=== La Peyr\u00e8re served as secretary to the Prince of Cond\u00e9 on whose orders he lived for one month in 1654 in a house in the Southern Netherlands adjoining that of the recently abdicated Queen Christina of Sweden. Christina is said to have financed the anonymous publication of Prae-Adamitae. During this time both Christina and La Peyr\u00e8re met with Menasseh Ben Israel, who was later invited by Oliver Cromwell's government to England to negotiate the readmission of Jews to that country. Menasseh became a convert to La Peyr\u00e8re's belief that the coming of the Jewish Messiah was imminent. La Peyr\u00e8re also argued that the Messiah would join with the king of France (that is, the Prince of Cond\u00e9, not Louis XIV of France) to liberate the Holy Land, rebuild the Temple and set up a world government of the Messiah with the king of France acting as regent. It has since emerged that, in fact: \"Cond\u00e9, Cromwell and Christina were negotiating to create a theological-political world state, involving overthrowing the Catholic king of France, among other things\". La Peyr\u00e8re was influenced by Thomas Hobbes and was an influence on Baruch Spinoza and on his younger direct acquaintance Richard Simon. ===Pre-Adamite hypothesis=== Du Rappel des Juifs (On the Calling of the Jews), by Isaac de La Peyr\u00e8re, published in 1643, without the name of the publisher and place of publication In his Prae-Adamitae, published in Latin in 1655 and in English as Men Before Adam in 1656, La Peyr\u00e8re argued that Paul's words in Chapter 5, verses 12-14 of his Epistle to the Romans should be interpreted such that \"if Adam sinned in a morally meaningful sense there must have been an Adamic law according to which he sinned. If law began with Adam, there must have been a lawless world before Adam, containing people\". Thus, according to La Peyr\u00e8re there must have been two creations: first the creation of the Gentiles and then that of Adam, who was father of the Jews. The existence of pre-Adamites, La Peyr\u00e8re argued, explained Cain's life after Abel's murder which, in the Genesis account, involved the taking of a wife and the building of a city. This account of human origins became the basis for 19th century theories of polygenism and were espoused by those trying to justify racism in the New World. This polygenesis of the Gentiles was his method of explaining the existence of the Negroes, Chinese, Eskimos, American Indians, Malays and other people groups being discovered. In 19th- century Europe polygenism and Pre-Adamism were attractive to those intent on demonstrating the inferiority of non-Western peoples, while in the United States those attuned to racial theories who found it unattractive to contemplate a common history with non-Whites, such as Charles Caldwell, Josiah C. Nott and Samuel G. Morton, also rejected the view that non-whites were the descendants of Adam. Morton combined pre-Adamism with cranial measurements to construct a theory of racial difference that justified slavery. As Michael Barkun explains, ===Later life=== La Peyr\u00e8re's pre-Adamite contentions were fiercely criticized by Protestant, Jewish and Catholic authorities. In 1656 after a storm of indignation the Prae-Adamitae was publicly burned in Paris. In particular, La Peyr\u00e8re fell foul of the Catholic Church, while in the Spanish Netherlands which was then under the Habsburgs. Here he was arrested and held in prison for six months and only released after renouncing his views and converting to the Catholic faith. He subsequently went to Rome and begged Pope Alexander VII for forgiveness, retracting his earlier views formally. Following this La Peyr\u00e8re became a lay member of the Oratory of Jesus in Paris and lived out the rest of his life, from 1659 until 1676. The sincerity of his conversion was later questioned. Pierre Bayle, for example, published a letter in which his religious superior wrote that he \"was always writing books that \u2026 would be burned as soon as the good man died.\" In his later life La Peyr\u00e8re was an influence on fellow Oratory of Jesus member, Richard Simon, who has been called \"father of the higher criticism\". ==See also== * Sabbatai Zevi * Ibn Wahshiyya * William Hamilton Reid * Jean Astruc Critics: * Thomas Burnet * Edward Stillingfleet == References == == External links == * * * Category:1596 births Category:1676 deaths Category:17th-century French people Category:French librarians Category:French Zionists Category:French Calvinist and Reformed theologians Category:Huguenots Category:Conversos Category:French people of Portuguese-Jewish descent Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Calvinism ",
