It was created in 1915 by the Board of Agriculture during World War I so women could work in agriculture, replacing men called up to the military. Women who worked for the WLA were commonly known as Land Girls. In effect the Land Army operated to place women with farms that needed workers, the farmers being their employers. They picked crops and did all the jobs that the men would do. Notable members included the archaeologist Lily Chitty and the botanist Ethel Thomas. It was disbanded in 1919 but revived in June 1939 under the same name. ==History== Working on a potato crop during World War I 2012 memorial A Good Service Ribbon was awarded to eligible women.97 years ago today: Presentation of Good Service Ribbons in Stafford, 1919 January 1918 saw the publication of the first issue of The Landswoman, the official monthly magazine of the Women\u2019s Land Army and the Women\u2019s Institutes.
