He was sentenced to 25 years in a camp near Magadan in the far east of Russia. Following the amnesty after Joseph Stalin's death, he was eventually able to return to Latvia in 1956. In 1958 he was arrested for the second time, accused of \"writing anti-Soviet letters\" and trying to regroup his former underground organization. He was sentenced to six years in the correctional labour camp of Mordovia, from which he returned to Latvia in 1964.Ints C\u0101l\u012btis.

In 1977 he collaborated with Viktors Kalni\u0146\u0161 and Estonian and Lithuanian dissidents to try to create the \"Estonian- Latvian-Lithuanian National Movement Main Committee\". In 1979 he signed the Baltic Appeal. In 1981 he signed an open letter asking to turn Northern Europe into a nuclear-free zone. Having been warned by the KGB, he was once again arrested in 1983 and sentenced to six years in prison. This arrest was part of a crackdown on Dievtur\u012bba, Latvia's Baltic neopaganism, which C\u0101l\u012btis is an adherent of. The Soviet authorities viewed the interest in folklore and ancient traditions as a cloak for nationalist and anti-Soviet sympathies, and accused C\u0101l\u012btis of Nazi activities.Erik Lettlander. 3 October 1983.
