It comprises six sections, each named after and associated with a different Leeds postal district, and each narrating the day of a different character.

It turns out that in the evening, all attend a play at the West Yorkshire Playhouse entitled The Death of Margaret Thatcher, during which the West Yorkshire Playhouse blows up due to a gas leak. In order, the sections and their protagonists are: * LS1: Francisco Jose Alvarez, an unemployed Spanish ham-carver who gets into a car crash alongside his British-Pakistani drug-dealer Nino. He comes into possession of tickets to the play when stealing a handbag. * LS2: Julianne Redgrave, a British widow in late middle age in need of intellectual stimulation and affection. She is invited to the play by a grocer at Kirkgate Market. * LS3: Andres Ramos, a Colombian who has through a series of migrations escaped the FARC and loses his job as a chicken-sexer in Morley when he beats up a Peruvian-Japanese colleague. He attends the play after finding a ticket dropped by Francisco. * LS6: Leo Carragher, a British-Italian theatre usher and frustrated intellectual nearing retirement. He is an usher at the play. * LS4: Filipe, a dancer and actor from Cape Verde who is seeking a meaningful relationship in a life defined by showbusiness. He is an actor in the play. * LS5: Ramtin, a Kurdish refugee from Iran who is seeking a publisher for a novel he has written, and a philosophical novel that he is planning. He is given a spare ticket to the play by his new-found publisher.
