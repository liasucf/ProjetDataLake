In 2002, Schram landed a major role opposite Tony Shalhoub on the USA Network series Monk. She was released midway through the show's third season. The network stated they had \"decided to go in a different creative direction with some of its characters.\" The Hollywood Reporter reported that \"some members of the series' supporting cast, including Schram, Ted Levine and Jason Gray-Stanford, attempted to renegotiate the terms of their contract[s]\" and cited Schram's departure as evidence of the industry's \"hard line against raise-seeking actors who aren't absolutely essential to the show.\" Levine and Gray-Stanford remained on the show. Natalie Teeger, played by Traylor Howard, replaced her character as Monk's assistant. Schram made a guest appearance on one episode of the show's eighth and final season, titled \"Mr. Monk and Sharona\".Summer TV sizzles with new shows and returning favorites , Boston Herald; accessed September 6, 2015. ==Filmography== ===Film=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
