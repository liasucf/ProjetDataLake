The patronymic Aupamanyava establishes him as a descendant of Upamanyu, while the name Kamboja suggests an association with the Kamboja kingdom of the (late Vedic) Mahajanapada period.Vedic Index of Names and Subjects, 1958, p 149, Arthur Anthony Macdonell, Arthur Berriedale Keith - Vedas. Vamsa Brahmana informs us that sage Anandaja had received the Vedic learning from sage Samba, the son of Sarkaraksa, as well as from Kamboja, the son or descendant of Upamanyu. ==Lineage== Vamsa BrahamanaSee: Vamsa Brahmana verse 1.18-19 of the Sama Veda refers to one Rsi Madragara Shaungayani as the teacher of Aupamanyava Kamboja. As the name itself suggests, risi Madragara Shaungayani belonged to Madra tribe, i.e. the Uttaramadras. Dr Jain also observes: \"Kamboja Aupamanyava, pupil of Madragara, is mentioned in the Vamsa Brahmana. This points to a possible relationship of the Madras or more probably of the Uttaramasdras with the Kambojas, who probably had Indian as well as Iranian affinities\".Ethnology of Ancient Bh\u0101rata, 1970, p 108, Dr Ram Chandra Jain. ==As a grammarian== Aupamanyava is repeatedly quoted as a grammarian by Yaska in his Nirukta, and also mentioned in respect of the Nisadas and the Panca-janah.Ref: Cultural Sources from the Veda, 1977, p 35, Sadashiv Ambadas Dange.Dialectics of Hindu Ritualism, 1956, pp 59, 133, Bhupendran\u0101tha Datta.Bh\u0101rat\u012bya Vidy\u0101: A Quarterly Research Organ of the Bhavan on All Subjects Connected with Indian Culture, 1967, p 56, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan (Bombay)-India.Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Vedic Terms, 2000, p 316, Parmeshwaranand - Vedas.Kamboja People and the Country, 1981, pp 204-205, Dr J.

Raychaudhury cites reference to Aupamanyava (Nirukta II.2) and identifies him with Kamboja Aupamanyava of the Vamsa Brahmana (Ibid).

Pt Bhagva Datta points out that, Dr G. Opart has referred to one nirukta (etymology) whose authorship he attributes to a certain Upamanyu Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts, Part II, p 510, Dr G Opart. ==Vamsa Brahmana== Commenting on the Vamsa Brahmana list of Vedic teachers, Albrecht Weber writes: \"One fact deserves to be especially noticed here, namely, that several of the teachers mentioned in the Vamsa Brahmana, by their very names, points us directly to the north-west of India, e.g. Kamboja Aupamanyava, Madaragara Saungayani, Sati Aushtrakshi, Salamkayana and Kauhala\" .See: The history of Indian literature, 2001 (edition), pp 74/75, fn 71, Albrecht Weber; See also I St., IV, pp 378-80. And commenting on the same list, R Morton Smith also writes: \u201cThe names Kamboja Aupamanyava, Sati Austraksi and Madragara Saungayani suggest a North-west connection for the main branch of Vamsa Brahmana.Dates and Dynasties: Part III : the Brahmans, 2000, p 79, R Morton Smith - Brahmans. Among the entire lists of ancient Vedic teachers of the Satapatha Brahmana as well as the Vamsa Brahmana,A History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature So Far as it Illustrates the Primitive Religion of the Brahmans, 1860, pp 438-444, Friedrich Max M\u00fcller - Sanskrit literature. Kamboja Aupamanyava appears as the first \"Aupamanyava\"' (i.e. son or descendant of Upamanyu). This Kamboja Aupamanyava was the guru of Anadaja Chandhanayana who in turn was the guru of Bhanumant Aupamanyava.Vamsa Brahmania 16-15. Bhanumant Aupamanyava had instructed Urjayant Aupamanyava.Vamsa Brahmana 15-14 Vedic teachers Bhanumanta Aupamanyava and Urjayant Aupamanyava of the Vamsa Brahmana list were probably the son and grandson of Kamboja Aupamanyava. ==Aupamanyava/Upamanyu Gotra== Upamanyu also is one of the gotras of Hindu brahmins. The people with Upamanyu gotra live in far western part of Nepal and eastern Parts of Jammu & Kashmir. They are basically present just below the Mount Kailash as they pray to Lord Shiva only. However, according to Dr D. C. Sircar, Upamanyu gotra is not found in early Sanskrit literature and it is difficult to determine at this time whether it is a mistake for Aupamanyava gotra.Epigraphia Indica, XXXIII, p 193. Prof B. N. Datta comments: \"...In the list of Brahmana gotras mentioned in the Matsya-Purana,Matasya Ourana Ch. 195, Sl. 336. the name \"Kamboja\" is to be found. It is said to be an offshoot of the Vrigu (Bhrigus) gotras. This means that a Rishi hailing from the Kamboja tribe was also founder of a Brahmanical class.......Weber says that the appearance of the name of Kamboja (an Indian-sounding name in Vedic text) as a Sama theologianVedic teacher Kamboja Aupamanyava mentioned in Vamsa Brahmana, 18. is analogous of the discovery of the name of Gautama in Zoroastrian Mithra-Yesht.Hymn to Mithra.Windischmann, Mithra, pp 29, 79.Indische Studien, herausg, 1858, p 356, Albrecht Friedrich Weber; Monatsberichte der K\u00f6niglichen preussische Akademie des Wissenschaften zu Berlin, 1858, p 5101, K\u00f6niglich Preussische Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin. Upamanyu was of Kamboja descent, and Ushtaxri (Sati Austrakshi) According to Vamsa Brahmana of Sama-Veda, Sati Aushtrakshi was the teacher of Madaragara Saungayanai. Madragara Saungayani was the guru of Kamboja Aupamanyava who in turn was the guru of Anandaja Chandhanayana. It appears that sage Ushtaxri/Ushtakshri was one of the two gurus of Sati Aushtrakshi, the second being Susravasa Varshaganya (See Vamsa Brahamana verses 18-22) was probably of Bactrian origin. Further, the name of prominent Rishi like Atharva sounds like Atharavan or Atharvan, the Persian fire-cult priest. The names of Atharva and Angirasa are connected with the introduction of fire-cult amongst the Vedic people. In this case, we find another infiltration of the foreign element (Kambojas etc.) in the ethnic composition of the Vedic Aryas\" .Dialectics of Hindu Ritualism, 1956, p 59, 60, 132, Bhupendran\u0101tha Datta. ==Notes== ==External links== *The Vam\u00e7abrahmana: (Friedrich Max M\u00fcller, 1860): *The Vam\u00e7abrahmana: (TITUS version by Jost Gippert): *The Vam\u00e7abrahmana: ( Arthur Coke Burnell,1873): Category:Hindu sages ",
