    "text": "BC Ekaterinburg () is a Russian women's basketball team based in Yekaterinburg competing in the Russian Premier League and FIBA Europe's Euroleague. It has been a highly successful team in recent years. Founded in 1938 as Zenit Ekaterinburg, the club had its name changed to Uralmash Ekaterinburg in 1960, like other teams from the city such as FC Ural. Four years later Uralmash reached the Soviet Top Division. In 1973 and 1974 it attained two 3rd spots, the club's best results in the Soviet era. After Uralmash was merged into OMZ the club was bought in 2000 by the newly formed company UMMC, adopting its current name. UMMC Ekaterinburg rapidly rose into the championship's elite, winning in 2002 its first national championship. The following year it won the Euroleague in its debut season, becoming the first Russian team to win the top European trophy. The team also defended its national title, making it a double. UMMC wasn't able to win the championship in the following five seasons with the rise of VBM-SGAU Samara and Spartak Moscow Region. In 2009 it began a new successful period, winning three doubles in a row. With five titles UMMC is the most successful active team in the championship. On the other hand, Spartak has blocked its path to the Euroleague final, having defeated UMMC in the Final Four's semi-finals in all last four seasons (2008\u201311). ==Titles== * 4 SuperCup (2013, 2016, 2018, 2019) 15px 15px 15px 15px * 5 Euroleague (2003, 2013, 2016, 2018, 2019) 15px 15px 15px 15px 15px * 14 Russian Leagues (2002, 2003, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020) * 9 Russian Cups (2005, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017, 2019) == Current roster== ==Former players== Basketball team in 2012 * Olga Korosteleva * Svetlana Abrosimova * Anna Arkhipova * Maria Stepanova * Ann Wauters * Penny Taylor * Cappie Pondexter * Hana Hor\u00e1kov\u00e1 * Ma\u0142gorzata Dydek * USA RUSSIA Deanna Nolan * Candace Parker * Maya Moore * Koraljka Hlede * Yolanda Griffith * Sue Bird * Diana Gustilina * Elena Karpova * DeLisha Milton-Jones * Ticha Penicheiro * Sandrine Gruda * C\u00e9line Dumerc * Audrey Sauret * Yelena Leuchanka * Irina Osipova * Yelena Baranova * S\u00edlvia Dom\u00ednguez * Suzy Batkovic-Brown * Diana Taurasi ==Former coaches== * Zoran Vi\u0161i\u0107 ==External links== * *FIBA team page Category:Women's basketball teams in Russia Category:EuroLeague Women clubs Category:Basketball teams established in 1938 Category:Sport in Yekaterinburg ",
