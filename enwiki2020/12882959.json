    "text": "Carriage driving, 1881 Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec Ardingly, Sussex, 2007 Carriage driving is a form of competitive horse driving in harness in which larger two or four wheeled carriages (often restored antiques) are pulled by a single horse, a pair, tandem or a four-in-hand team. In competitions the driver and horse(s) have to complete three tests: Dressage, Marathon, and Obstacle Driving. The International Federation for Equestrian Sports oversees International Shows. The FEI Driving rules are followed in these competitions which aim to protect the welfare of the horse and also ensure fairness in competitions. Pleasure competitions also have classes which are judged on the turnout, neatness or suitability of the horse(s) and carriage. ==References== ==See also== * Pleasure driving * Combined driving * Coachman ==External links== * serious competition * competition Category:Horse driving Category:Horse showing and exhibition ",
