    "text": "The 1979 Military Friendship Athletics Championships was an international men's outdoor track and field competition between military athletes from states of the Eastern Bloc, including the Soviet Union, East Germany, Poland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Cuba. The competition was held in Potsdam, East Germany from 30 August to 1 September. Poland's Marian Woronin claimed a sprint double in the 100 metres and 200 metres while East Germany's J\u00fcrgen Straub did the middle-distance equivalent in the 800 metres and 1500 metres. The most prominent athlete at the competition was the reigning 1976 Olympic hammer throw champion Yuriy Sedykh, who comfortably won his event by several metres. East German Ronald Weigel's win in the 20 kilometres race walk was also a standout performance, as the future world champion finished over two minutes ahead of his rivals. ==Results== {| |- |100 metres | || 10.38 | || 10.46 | || 10.35 |- |200 metres | || 20.87 | || 20.97 | || 21.09 |- |400 metres | || 46.37 | || 46.65 | || 46.79 |- |800 metres | || 1:46.9 | || 1:47.8 | || 1:48.0 |- |1500 metres | || 3:33.7 | || 3:37.4 | || 3:37.6 |- |5000 metres | || 13:45.1 | || 13:46.4 | || 13:50.7 |- |10,000 metres | || 28:37.1 | || 28:41.4 | || 29:38.0 |- |110 m hurdles | || 13.96 | || 14.04 | || 14.05 |- |400 m hurdles | || 50.56 | || 50.99 | || 51.07 |- |3000 m s'chase | || 8:31.1 | || 8:31.9 | || 8:33.7 |- |4 \u00d7 100 m relay | Ryszard Sadkowski Zenon Licznerski Miros\u0142aw Kobielski Marian Woronin || 40.10 | Vardas Zdenek Mazur Ladislav Latocha Roman Lacko || 40.50 | Ingo Voge Christian Neubert Uwe Barucha Klaus-Dieter Kurrat || 40.52 |- |4 \u00d7 400 m relay | Jerzy W\u0142odarczyk Ryszard Podlas Andrzej St\u0119pie\u0144 Jerzy Konarski || 3:08.51 | Klaus Thiele Frank Lehmann Klaus Hauck Frank Schaffer || 3:09.55 | Vladimir Konovalov Oleg Bulatkin Valeriy Mashkovskiy Dmitry Stukalov || 3:09.91 |- |20 km walk | || 1:28:29.4 | || 1:30:31.9 | || 1:32:31.2 |- |Pole vault | || 5.45 | || 5.30 | || 5.30 |- |High jump | || 2.19 | || 2.19 | || 2.13 |- |Long jump | || 7.78 | || 7.69 | || 7.66 |- |Triple jump | || 16.84 | || 16.25 | || 16.17 |- |Shot put | || 19.71 | || 19.61 | || 19.02 |- |Discus throw | || 63.92 | || 60.68 | || 59.90 |- |Hammer throw | || 75.24 | || 70.92 | || 69.24 |- |Javelin throw | || 80.44 | || 78.64 | || 78.62 |- |Decathlon | || 7898 pts | || 7739 pts | || 7223 pts |} ==References== *Micha\u0142 Wr\u00f3blewski, Ludwik Biega\u0144ski, Marek \u0141uczy\u0144ski, Maciej Petruczenko, Maciej Wawrzykowski: 60 lat PZLA \u2013 Rocznik PZLA 1979 (60 years of the Polish Athletic Association \u2013 1979).
