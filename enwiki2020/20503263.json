    "text": "William Hoover Yawkey (August 22, 1875 \u2013 March 5, 1919) was an American business executive in the lumber and mining industries. He was the sole owner of the Detroit Tigers of the American League from 1903 through 1908, and majority owner from 1908 to 1919. ==Biography== Yawkey was the son of wealthy Michigan lumber tycoon William Clyman Yawkey. The elder Yawkey agreed to buy the Tigers from Samuel F. Angus in 1903, but died before the deal closed. Frank Navin, then the Tigers' bookkeeper and vice president, persuaded the younger Yawkey to complete the deal. Yawkey took little interest in the Tigers, leaving day-to-day control in Navin's hands. In 1908, Yawkey sold almost half of the club's stock to Navin, making Navin essentially a full partner. Following Yawkey's death, additional stock was sold to Navin, raising his stake in the Tigers to 50 percent. Yawkey died in Augusta, Georgia, in 1919 from the Spanish flu. He was interred in a family lot in Brattleboro, Vermont. Upon Yawkey's death, he left his $40 million estate to his nephew and adoptive son, Tom Yawkey, who later bought the Boston Red Sox. A boathouse that Yawkey had constructed in 1917 in Hazelhurst, Wisconsin, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. A cousin, Cyrus C. Yawkey, owned a lumber business and was a politician in Wisconsin. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *Detroit Tigers owners * Category:1875 births Category:1919 deaths Category:People from Bay City, Michigan Category:American business executives Category:Major League Baseball owners Category:Detroit Tigers owners Category:Deaths from Spanish flu Category:Infectious disease deaths in Georgia (U.S. state) ",
