It was first released in French in May 2018. __NOTOC__ ==Structure and story== The book is a non-chronological account of several anecdotes about the author's life living with his father. Louis tells different stories about living with his father, sometimes with contradictory details. Some scenes are violent, while some are loving. The book's title is not a question, and Louis addresses the list of those he considers responsible for the destruction of his father's body, and pending death. These are, according to him, politicians and political people who have passed reforms impacting the poor. Specifically, he blames French presidents Jacques Chirac, Nicolas Sarkozy and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, as well as Emmanuel Macron, the French president at the time of the book's publication. ==Reception== Writing for T\u00e9l\u00e9rama, Fabienne Pascaud referred to the book as a \"poignant ode\". Similarly, Pierre Vavasseur wrote in Le Parisien that the book is both \"angry and poignant\". ==Translation== A German translation was published in January 2019. ==References== Category:2018 French novels Category:Autobiographical novels Category:Nonlinear narrative literature ",
