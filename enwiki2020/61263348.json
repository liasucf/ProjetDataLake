    "text": "Lulu Bell Parr (1876 \u2013 1960), was a Wild West performer known for her sharpshooting, trick riding, bronc riding, and buffalo riding. During her career she was titled the \"Champion Lady Bucking Horse Rider of the World.\" In 2005, she was inducted into the Cowgirl Hall of Fame. == Background == Lulu Bell Parr was born in 1876 and was fostered to her Uncle at the age of three when her parents died suddenly. The only immediate family left was a seven year old brother who she lived with at their Uncle and Aunt's farm in Fort Wayne, Indiana. On March 31, 1896 Parr married in Jefferson County, Ohio, to a George Barrett. They divorced in 1902, and she relocated alone to Steubenville, Ohio. In 1903 she traveled to Europe having joined the Pawnee Bill\u2019s Wild West Brighton Tour. There, she met several royals including England\u2019s King Edward. By 1911 Parr joined Pawnee Bill's Wild West program that was associated with Buffalo Bill\u2019s. Cody was charmed by her performance of daring: \u201cBronco busting isn\u2019t a game for the timid and weak,\u201d he said to a newspaper about Parr in January 1912. \u201cDeath lurks close every time a rider mounts up.\u201d Cody awarded Parr with a Colt single-action revolver made with an ivory handle that was engraved \u201cBuffalo Bill Cody to Lulu Parr \u2013 1911.\u201d Parr left Buffalo Bill's Wild West show in 1913 and began working for the 101 Ranch Wild West program that traveled to South America. Argentine President Jose Figueroa Alcorta was in attendance and showered her with flowers and gifts. In 1916, Parr was back in Pawnee Bill\u2019s Wild West Show and was given top-bill. Unfortunately the times were slowing for the Wild West shows and subsequently she toured one Wild West show after another with very little financial reward. By 1929, she was penniless and decided to leave the business behind. She spent her last days in Dayton, Ohio, with her brother who was taking care of his invalid wife in a dire home. She found some pleasure in entertaining neighboring children of her daring feats. Parr died on April 24, 1960. After her death the newspapers wrote about her packed bedroom of souvenirs and the many flamboyant costumes she handmade, photos, and the Colt revolver Buffalo Bill had given her. ==References== Category:1876 births Category:1960 deaths Category:American female equestrians Category:Wild West shows Category:Saddle bronc riders Category:Trick riding Category:Women stunt performers Category:Cowgirl Hall of Fame inductees Category:People from Fort Wayne, Indiana ",
