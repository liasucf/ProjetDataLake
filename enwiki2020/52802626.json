According to its mission statement, LALMA \"promotes a better understanding of Islam to the Spanish speaking community and establishes a forum of spiritual nurturing and social support to Latino Muslims, building bridges among the monotheistic community and advocating for social justice in accordance with Islamic values.\" Initially LALMA stood for Los Angeles Latino Muslims Association, but after a restructuring to accommodate its growth, LALMA was renamed to La Asociacion Latino Musulmana de America. Each Sunday morning, LALMA members gather to attend Arabic lessons, receive instruction on the Quran and the biography of Muhammad (sirah), and discuss issues of interest to Muslim converts. They regularly have guest lectures on different aspects of Islam.
