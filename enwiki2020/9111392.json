He played for Aston Villa during his professional career and won seven caps as an England striker, scoring three times, including once against Germany on his debut in 1938. He guested for Nottingham Forest during WW2, making 3 appearances (1 goal) in 1939\u201340, 1 appearance (4 goals) in 1940\u201341 and 10 appearances (4 goals) in 1941\u201342. He also guested for Wolves during wartime, playing and scoring in the 1942 War Cup Final. In 1955 Broome signed for Shelbourne, making his League of Ireland debut on 27 February. The nearest he came to scoring was when he had a penalty saved at Glenmalure Park on 27 March in the FAI Cup. Approaching 40 years of age and coupled with the expense of weekly flights to Dublin he ended up only playing 6 games for Shels. After retiring from playing, he went on to manage both Exeter City, Southend United and in Australia. == References == == External links == * * Player profile at Aston Villa Players Database * Player Profile at englandstats.com Category:1915 births Category:1994 deaths Category:English footballers Category:England international footballers Category:English Football League players Category:Berkhamsted Town F.C. players Category:Aston Villa F.C. players Category:Watford F.C. wartime guest players Category:Derby County F.C. players Category:Notts County F.C. players Category:Brentford F.C. players Category:Crewe Alexandra F.C. players Category:Shelbourne F.C. players Category:English football managers Category:Exeter City F.C. managers Category:Southend United F.C. managers Category:League of Ireland players Category:English expatriate football managers Category:Expatriate soccer managers in Australia Category:Parramatta FC managers Category:English expatriate sportspeople in Australia Category:Association football forwards Category:Association football outside forwards ",
