    "text": "Anand Varma is an American photographer of Indian descent. ==Early life== Varma was born in Atlanta, Georgia. As a child, he dreamed of becoming a marine biologist because he was fascinated by various marine species, especially fish. By the age of 14 he got employed by the local aquarium store where his job was to sell various fishes and study their biology. His passion for fish research grew even further when he began his college career at the University of California, Berkeley, where he also studied elk behavior and forest ecology. ==Career== Varma worked with David Liittschwager on several National Geographic magazine stories as an assistant and videographer. In one of the interviews with National Geographic he said that he admires Charles Darwin and E. O. Wilson. During his Young Explorers Grant project in Patagonia he was a wetland photographer where his field sites included temperate rain forests, bamboo thickets, and arid grasslands. ==References== ==External links== * Anand Varma Photography * * Category:Photographers from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Artists from Atlanta Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ",
