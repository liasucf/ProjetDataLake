    "text": "The Gravelly Hill Interchange in Birmingham, England \u2013 the original Spaghetti Junction Spaghetti Junction is a nickname sometimes given to a complicated or massively intertwined road traffic interchange that is said to resemble a plate of spaghetti. Such interchanges may incorporate a variety of interchange design elements in order to maximize connectivity. ==Etymology== The term was originally used to refer to the Gravelly Hill Interchange on the M6 motorway in Birmingham, United Kingdom. In an article published in the Birmingham Evening Mail on 1 June 1965 the journalist Roy Smith described plans for the junction as \"like a cross between a plate of spaghetti and an unsuccessful attempt at a Staffordshire knot\", with the headline above the article on the newspaper's front page, written by sub-editor Alan Eaglesfield, reading \"Spaghetti Junction\". Since then many complex interchanges around the world have acquired the nickname. Throughout North America, this type of interchange is widely referred to as a spaghetti junction, mixing bowl, knot, or maze, often including the name of the freeway, city, or notable landmark near enough to the interchange. Japan, somewhat colloquially, has adopted the term tentacle junction in lieu of the Western phrase. ==By country== ===Australia=== ====New South Wales==== * Light Horse Interchange, at the junction of M7 Westlink Motorway and M4 Western Motorway in Eastern Creek, Sydney. ====Queensland==== * The interchange at the junction of M3 Inner City Bypass, M7 Clem Jones Tunnel, and M7 Airport Link in Bowen Hills, Brisbane, often referred to as \"Spaghetti Junction\" by local residents. ===Botswana=== * Thapama Interchange at the junction of A1 / Blue Jacket Street and A3 in Francistown. ===Canada=== ====Ontario==== * The interchange between Bloor Street, Dundas Street, and Kipling Avenue in Toronto's west end, officially known as the Six Points Interchange, but often referred to as \"Spaghetti Junction\" by local residents.
