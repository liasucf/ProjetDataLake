    "text": "In this Feynman diagram, electrons annihilate and become a quark-antiquark pair. Then one radiates a gluon. (Time goes left to right.) In particle physics, a radiative process refers to one elementary particle emitting another and continuing to exist. This typically happens when a fermion emits a boson such as a gluon or photon. ==See also== *Bremsstrahlung Category:Radiation Category:Particle physics ",
