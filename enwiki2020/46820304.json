Thing is, The Swing's to TV is great stuff, a cerebral and atmospheric set of ballads performed with sincerity and affection -- Shank and Cooper always make for a compelling tandem, and songs like \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" and \"Put Your Dreams Away\" are well matched to their respective talents\". ==Track listing== # \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" (Leigh Harline, Ned Washington) - 4:21 # \"Put Your Dreams Away\" (Ruth Lowe, Paul Mann, Stephen Weiss) - 3:09 # \"Thanks for the Memory\" (Ralph Rainger, Leo Robin) - 4:32 # \"Tenderly\" (Walter Gross, Jack Lawrence) - 2:56 # \"Danny Boy\" (Traditional) - 4:39 # \"Dinah\" (Harry Akst, Sam M.
