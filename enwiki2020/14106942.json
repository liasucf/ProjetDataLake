    "text": "Coat of arms of the Swedish noble family, Natt och Dag Natt och Dag (, literally \"night and day\") is a Swedish noble family and the oldest still existing family of pure Swedish extraction; officially known since the year 1280, according to documents at the Swedish National Archives. == History == The oldest established ancestor is the knight, Lawspeaker of V\u00e4rend, and Privy Councillor Nils Sigridsson , known since 11 May 1280. From his grandson's grandson's son, the knight, Lawspeaker of N\u00e4rke and Privy Councillor Magnus Bengtsson (between 1473 and 1477) stems the currently known family. His grandson's grandson was introduced at the House of Nobility in Sweden in the year 1625. The family members first started to use the name Natt och Dag in the 18th century, why many members' names are written with the family name within parentheses, i.e. (Natt och Dag). The name alludes to the contrast difference between the blue and the golden field the family's coat of arms. In the early 16th century, the Swedish coin was mint-marked with the Natt och Dag coat of arms, due to members of the family being regents of Sweden. Gabriel Anrep, a Swedish genealogist of the 19th century, wrote: As of 31 December 2007, 56 persons carried the name Natt och Dag in Sweden. Branches residing in the United States are named DeRemee and Dagg. == Coat of arms == * Shield: Parti per fess Or and Azure. * Helm: Six peacock feathers between two colours. The arms are actually symbolical canting arms: Azure (blue) symbolizes night and Or (gold) day. == Noted members == * M\u00e5ns Johansson, owned among other properties the manor Ringshult (Liljeholmen) at the shores of Sommen.
