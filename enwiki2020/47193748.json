    "text": "For the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification, there were two scheduled inter- confederation play-offs to determine the final two qualification spots to the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The matches were originally scheduled to be played between 6\u201314 November 2017, and later confirmed to take place between 10\u201315 November. ==Format== The draw for the inter-confederation play-offs was held as part of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Preliminary Draw on 25 July 2015, starting 18:00 MSK (UTC+3), at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg. The four teams from the four confederations (AFC, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, and OFC) were drawn into two ties. There was no seeding. In each tie, the two teams will play a two-legged home-and-away series. The two winners, decided on aggregate score, qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. If the aggregate score is level, the away goals rule is applied, i.e. the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs advances. If away goals are also equal, then 30 minutes of extra time is played. The away goals rule is again applied after extra time, i.e. if there are goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score is still level, the visiting team advances by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals are scored during extra time, the tie is decided by penalty shoot-out. ==Qualified teams== {| class=wikitable ! Confederation ! Placement ! Team |- | AFC | Fourth Round (play-off) winners | |- | CONCACAF | Fifth Round 4th place | |- | CONMEBOL | Round-Robin 5th place | |- | OFC | Third Round winners | |} ==Matches== The first legs were played on 10 and 11 November 2017, and the second legs were played on 15 November 2017. ===CONCACAF v AFC=== Australia won 3\u20131 on aggregate and qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. ===OFC v CONMEBOL=== Peru won 2\u20130 on aggregate and qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. ==Goalscorers== ;3 goals * Mile Jedinak ;1 goal * Maynor Figueroa * Jefferson Farf\u00e1n * Christian Ramos ==References== ==External links== * **Qualifiers, FIFA.com Play-Off * FIFA World Cup qualifcation ",
