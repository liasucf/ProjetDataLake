    "text": "Speak Your Mind is the debut studio album by British singer, songwriter Anne- Marie, released on 27 April 2018 by Major Tom's and Asylum Records. Anne-Marie announced the album on 21 February 2018 and it was made available for pre- order two days later. The album was preceded by the release of seven singles and features collaborations with Marshmello, Clean Bandit, David Guetta and Sean Paul. Speak Your Mind received \"generally favorable reviews\". The album was a commercial success peaking at number 3 in both the UK Albums (OCC) chart and the Scottish Albums (OCC) chart. It also peaked at number 4 in the Irish Albums (IRMA) chart. It has since been certified platinum by both the United States (RIAA) and Canada (Music Canada). ==Background== Talking to Polish pop culture magazine Luvpop about the album's title, Anne-Marie said: \"I just feel like that's what I did on the album. I'm not a shy person anyway, I speak my mind a lot and I am not... I don't hold anything in, I am honest with people and open. And I've just feel that's what I've been like on this album, so it kinda makes sense.\" ==Singles== \"Alarm\" was released as the lead single from Speak Your Mind on 20 May 2016. The single became Anne-Marie's first major worldwide hit, peaking at No. 16 on the UK Singles Chart. The single additionally reached the top 20 in as Australia and Scotland, as well as the top 40 in seven countries. It was certified Platinum in the UK, Australia, and Poland, and Gold in the US and Canada. The music video for the song, also released on 20 May 2016, was directed by Malia James and filmed in Mexico City. It is loosely inspired by Baz Luhrmann's 1996 film Romeo + Juliet. \"Ciao Adios\" was released as the second official single on 10 February 2017. The single became her first top ten hit in the UK, reaching No. 9, while also reaching the top ten in Belgium, Netherlands, Poland, and Scotland. The single had moderate success elsewhere. The \"Ciao Adios\" music video was released on 9 March 2017 on YouTube and features Anne-Marie with her girl gang dancing in Marrakech, Morocco with plenty of colors. \"Heavy\" was released on 22 September 2017 as the third single from the record.

However, as Anne-Marie attempts to kick him out, he keeps finding ways to get back into the house, which annoys Anne-Marie and her friends. \"2002\" was released as the sixth single on 20 April 2018. The song debuted at number 8 in the United Kingdom, becoming Anne-Marie's fourth UK top 10 hit, before later climbing to number three, making it Anne-Marie's highest-charting song as a lead artist.
