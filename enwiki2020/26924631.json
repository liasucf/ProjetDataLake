    "text": "A designated place is a type of geographic unit used by Statistics Canada to disseminate census data. It is usually a small community that does not meet the criteria used to define incorporated municipalities or Statistics Canada population centres (areas with a population of at least 1,000 and no fewer than 400 persons per square kilometre). Designated places are created by provinces and territories, in cooperation with Statistics Canada, to provide data for submunicipal areas. At the 2011 Census of Canada, Alberta had 261 designated places with a cumulative population of 46,510 and an average population of 178. Alberta's largest designated place is Wabasca with a population of 1,302. == List == The following is a list of designated places in Alberta. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Name !Municipality
