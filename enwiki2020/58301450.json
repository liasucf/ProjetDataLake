Between 1865 and 1890 the Colonial Architects Office was responsible for the building and maintenance of 169 Post Offices and telegraph offices in NSW. The post offices constructed during this period were designed in a variety of architectural styles, as Barnet argued that the local parliamentary representatives always preferred \"different patterns\". The 1890s witnessed a building boom in the town of Glen Innes with many of the grand public and commercial buildings along the main street being erected. In 1896 a new post office was constructed on the site of the former office which had been demolished to make way for it. The building was designed by the Office of the Colonial Architect under the direction of Walter Liberty Vernon, with the building tender being awarded to the Sandbrook Brothers for \u00a32505.
