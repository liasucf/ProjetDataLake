Monthly features include: Car + Garage, Stuff We Love, Home Care + Repair, Handy Hints, Top Ten Tips, Pro Tips, DIY Quiz, and Great Goofs. Both magazine and web content provides resources for do-it-yourself homeowners, including how-to instructions for improving homes, yards and vehicles. The Family Handyman also publishes several special interest publications, tablet editions of the magazine, a DIY Tip Genius app, and The Family Handyman DIY University, an online curriculum of DIY courses. ==Digital== Professional handymen and amateur DIYers can find both new and archived magazine content on The Family Handyman website, which focuses on how-to articles, woodworking project plans, home repairs, bathroom remodeling, kitchen remodeling, do it yourself (DIY) tutorials, and lawn care.
