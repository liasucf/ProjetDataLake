    "text": "Hugues Alexandre Sinclair de Rochemont (Hilversum, January 6, 1901 \u2013 March 13, 1942) was a Dutch fascist and later a collaborator with the Nazis. Whilst studying Indology at Leiden University, he became associated with the rightist professor Gerardus Johannes Petrus Josephus Bolland (1854 - 1922). After leaving the university in 1924, he set up the country's first fascist movement, the Verbond van Actualisten, with Alfred Haighton.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1991 This group had stood in the 1925 general election but won only 0.08% of the vote.R. J. B. Bosworth, The Oxford Handbook of Fascism, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 454 Alongside this, Sinclair de Rochemont worked as a journalist for De Vaderlander and as a strike breaker. In 1927, he began editing De Bezem (The Broom), a fascist journal aimed at the working classes and continued to publish under this name after 1930, when he split from Haighton. Having split from Haighton, Sinclair de Rochemont became associated with Joris Van Severen of Belgium, although most of his time was given over to his work as a civil servant and then as an antiquarian bookseller. He joined both the National Front and the National Socialist Dutch Workers Party in 1940, having become fully convinced of Nazism, even to the point of accepting the incorporation of the Netherlands into the Third Reich. After spells in prison for homosexuality and attempting to assassinate Anton Mussert, Sinclair volunteered for the Dutch legion of the Waffen-SS and was killed on active duty near Grisi in the Soviet Union. ==References== Category:1901 births Category:1942 deaths Category:People from Hilversum Category:Dutch fascists Category:Dutch journalists Category:Dutch collaborators with Nazi Germany Category:LGBT journalists from the Netherlands Category:Waffen-SS foreign volunteers and conscripts Category:Leiden University alumni Category:National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands politicians Category:German military personnel killed in World War II Category:20th-century journalists ",
