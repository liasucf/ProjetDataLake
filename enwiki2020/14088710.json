    "text": "National City Christian Church, located on Thomas Circle in Washington, D.C., is the national church of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) (often abbreviated as the \"Disciples of Christ\" or \"Christian Church\"). The denomination grew out of the Stone-Campbell Movement founded by Thomas Campbell and Alexander Campbell of Pennsylvania and West Virginia (then Virginia) and Barton W. Stone of Kentucky. ==History== The congregation that eventually became the National City Christian Church was organized in 1843. James Turner Barclay (1807-1874), a physician and pioneering Stone-Campbell Movement missionary, helped to organize the congregation.Paul M. Blowers, \"Barclay, James Turner\" in The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement (ed. Douglas A. Foster et al.: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2004), p. 69. In the 1950s and 1960s, the church had a congregation of some 800 regular Sunday worshipers. Attendance declined over time, however; in 2011, Sunday attendance was about 125, with mostly older congregants.Del Quentin Wilber, In crisis, National City Christian Church\u2019s members find strength, Washington Post (November 22, 2011). In 2004, the church's senior pastor, the Rev. Alvin O. Jackson, resigned following a heated acrimonious dispute. The ouster of Jackson followed the resignation or firings of some two dozen church staffers, and the development of a deep intra-congregational dispute.Bill Broadway, Local Divisions lead National City Christian Church pastor to resign, Washington Post (November 4, 2004). Jackson was replaced as senior pastor by the Rev. Stephen Gentle, \"a soft-spoken pastor of a Florida church.\" Subsequently, the church's chief financial officer, Jason Todd Reynolds, was discovered to have embezzled $850,000 in church funds from 2003 to 2008. In 2011, Reynolds was convicted of 12 fraud-related charges.Maryland Man Convicted of Embezzling More Than $500,000 From District of Columbia Church (press release), United States Department of Justice (August 16, 2011). He was sentenced to eight years in prison.Del Quentin Wilber, Prison for former church CFO who stole $850,000, Washington Post (November 9, 2011). The losses from Reynolds' embezzlement scheme caused serious damage to the church's financial health. The 2011 Virginia earthquake caused structural damage to the church building, causing financial troubles for the church. == Architecture and surroundings== The neoclassical church building was designed by John Russell Pope and completed in 1930.G. Martin Moeller Jr., AIA Guide to the Architecture of Washington, Part 3 (4th ed.: Johns Hopkins University Press/Washington Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, 2006), p. 271. The church is very large in sizeMoeller, p. 271. and has a \"monumental character\" typical of Pope's style and seen in his other works, such as the Jefferson Memorial.Thomas A. Tweed, America's Church: The National Shrine and Catholic Presence in the Nation's Capital (Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 337. The church's design was partly influenced by James Gibbs' St Martin-in- the-Fields church, built at Trafalgar Square, London, in the early 18th century.Moeller, p. 271; see also Pamela Scott & Antoinette Jos\u00e9phine Lee, Buildings of the District of Columbia (Society of Architectural Historians/Oxford University Press, 1993), p. 295. The building is built of Indiana limestone.Tweed, p. 337. Scholar Thomas A. Tweed writes that the building's facade, \"high on a terrace overlooking Thomas Circle, a prominent location in the city ... demands the attention of motorists and pedestrians.\"Tweed, p. 337. The church \"features stained glass windows commemorating the two presidents associated with the denomination, James Garfield and Lyndon Johnson.\" Peter W. Williams, Houses of God: Region, Religion, and Architecture in the United States (University of Illinois Press, 1997), p. 76. The church is a contributing property to the Greater Fourteenth Street Historic District.National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Greater Fourteenth Street Historic District (boundary increase); Fourteenth Street Historic District (name change), National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior; see also [Greater Fourteenth Street Historic District map], District of Columbia Office of Planning (April 3, 2016). Across the street from the National City Christian Church is the Luther Place Memorial Church, which is also a historic church. Luther Place Memorial Church's neo-Gothic style sharply contrasts with the Neoclassical style of National City Christian Church.Moeller, p. 270. Other historic churches nearby include the Universalist National Memorial Church.Tweed, p. 337.

His state funeral was held here in 1973. *Ronald B.
