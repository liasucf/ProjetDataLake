    "text": "Moses ben Isaac ha-Levi Minz (15th century) was a German rabbi, a disciple of R. Yaakov Weil and contemporary of Israel Isserlein, whom he frequently consulted. He was successively rabbi at Mainz, Landau, Bamberg, and Posen. He is one of the first known Jewish Scholars to have officiated as Rav of a city in Poland.The Rishonim, The Artscroll history series, Pg. 153 In his responsa (No. 114) he mentions a certain Jacob Margolioth of \u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d5 (Lucca?), and refers to a case of divorce in Posen in 1444 (Steinschneider gives 1474). Fr\u00e4nkel (Zeitschrift, iii. 387) doubts that Moses ever was at Posen. He suggests that \u05e4\u05d5\u05d6\u05e0\u05d5 (Posen) is a printer's mistake for \u05e4\u05d9\u05d6\u05e8\u05d5 (Pesaro). Moses' responsa (Cracow, 1617) mention also Joseph Colon, Israel Isserlein, and his cousin Judah Minz. Responsum No. 46 contains a dispute over a philological point with Eliezer Treves (comp. M. Wiener in Monatsschrift, xvi. 390). == Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography == *Azulai, Shem ha-Gedolim, i.140; *David Conforte, \u1e32ore ha-Dorot, p. 27b; *Julius F\u00fcrst, Bibl.
