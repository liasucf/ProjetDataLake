He was the father of the Romanian Prime Ministers Dumitru Br\u0103tianu and Ion Br\u0103tianu. Organic Regulation a \"parliament\" of boyars was installed in Bucharest and Constantin \"Dinc\u0103\" Br\u0103tianu became one of its deputates There are different legends about the origin of the Br\u0103tianus. According especially to national liberal historians and politiciansLucian Boia: Geschichte und Mythos - \u00dcber die Gegenwart des Vergangenen in der rum\u00e4nischen Gesellschaft, page 236ff. B\u00f6hlau, K\u00f6ln 2003 (e. g. Constantin's granddaughter Sabina Br\u0103tianu- Cantacuzino, Constantin's great-grandson Gheorghe Br\u0103tianu or Ion Duca) the female line of the family history goes back to the Vl\u0103descu boyars of the Arge\u0219 County. By the end of the 18th century Constantin's father Iane (or Ene) Br\u0103tianu, a minor boyar (\u0218\u0103trar), has married into the Vl\u0103descu family. However, contrary to that, a certain Dr. Georgiyev, linguist at Oriental Academy of Vienna, claimed that Constantin Br\u0103tianu has been of Bulgarian descent and immigrated from Gorna Oryahovitsa (in the Turkish ruled Northern Bulgaria) into WallachiaThis allegation was published in 1916, just at the moment when Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria were at war with Romania. Probably, it was war propaganda to discredit the Romanian prime minister Ionel Br\u0103tianu (who was a son of Ion and grandson of Constantin Br\u0103tianu).K\u00f6lnische Zeitung (German newspaper from Cologne) from September 20, 1916: Br\u0103tianu - ein Bulgarenst\u00e4mmling! not before the Russo-Turkish wars when Wallachia was temporarily occupied by the Russians. Following another Russo-Turkish war Wallachia was occupied again and the Organic Regulation was imposed there. Based on that Regulament the Russians installed a parliament-like assembly of boyars. From 1831 on Constantin Br\u0103tianu, meanwhile the wealthiest of all boyars of the county, represented Arge\u0219 in the Wallachian assembly. Additionally in 1835 he became the county administrator of Arge\u0219 and in 1839 the Wallachian prince Alexandru Dimitrie Ghica honored him with the rank of a clucer. Allegedly until that time Constantin Br\u0103tianu was \"knowing neither how to write nor to read, barely even able to sign his name\". (Instead of reading or writing Romanian, according to the Viennian linguist, Br\u0103tianu still spoke Bulgarian.) With his wife Anastasia (also called Anica or Sica) Tigveanu, who died in 1838 (or 1839), Constantin Br\u0103tianu had three sons and four daughters. The oldest son (Teodor) became a general. Despite their boyaric origin, the two other sons (Dumitru and Ion) founded the National Liberal Party (Partidul Na\u021bional Liberal) to end the rule of the conservative boyar's party \u2013 at least until the moment, when Dumitru allied himself with the boyar's party to overthrow his brother Ion. == Annotation == == References == Category:1844 deaths Constantin Category:19th-century Romanian people Category:Honorary members of the Romanian Academy Category:18th-century births ",
