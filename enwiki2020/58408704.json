    "text": "The Bechdel Cast is a weekly podcast about the representation of women in film. The Bechdel Cast is hosted by Los Angeles-based comedians Caitlin Durante and Jamie Loftus.Zaino III, Nick A. (September 6, 2017) \"The Ones to Watch At Boston Comedy Arts Festival\" Boston Globe Retrieved November 12, 2018. In November 2016 The Bechdel Cast released their introductory episode titled \"Welcome to The Bechdel Cast!\" Their first episode was on the film Kill Bill with guest Zach Sherwin. The show is broadcast on the iHeartRadio Network (after HowStuffWorks Network, under Stuff Media, was bought by iHeartMedia). Episodes are available on iTunes, Stitcher Radio, SoundCloud, and Spotify. Wright, Megh (August 3, 2018) \"This Week in Comedy Podcasts\" Vulture Retrieved November 12, 2018. Select episodes are released to supporters on the crowdfunding platform Patreon twice a month. Villeneuve, Nicole (October 18, 2018) \"11 TV and Movie Podcasts Every Pop Culture Nerds Need in Their Life\" Brit + Co Retrieved November 12, 2018. == Premise == The name of the podcast derives from cartoonist Alison Bechdel, who developed the concept of the Bechdel test. The test investigates whether or not a work includes at least two women conversing about a topic other than a man. Sometimes a requirement that the two women must have names is added, which is a rule the podcast adheres to.Racic, Monica (March 3, 2018) \"Do This Year's Best Picture Nominees Pass the Bechdel Test?\" The New Yorker Retrieved November 12, 208. For the purposes of the show, the exchange only needs to be two lines of dialogue. A commonality of many movies that pass are that often only this minimum is reached typically by an inconsequential conversation or one in which the two lines are nested within a larger conversation that is about men. The hosts often discuss the limitations of the Bechdel Test and, despite using it as their namesake, primarily employ it to initiate a larger discussion about the depiction and uses of female-identifying characters in film. Bryan, Scott; Lane, Tim; Furlan, Julia (February 8, 2018) \"27 Podcasts You Need to Start Listening to in 2018\" BuzzFeed Retrieved November 12, 2018.The hosts have recently moved to a use of the test that looks at whether a film has two named characters of any marginalized gender, who have a conversation about anything other than a man, for two lines of dialogue. They occasionally reference and utilize similar tests of representation, such as the Vito Russo test, the DuVernay Test, and the Mako Mori Test. Douglas, Nick (October 10, 2017) \"The Bechdel Test and Other Media Representation Tests, Explained\" Lifehacker Retrieved November 12, 2018. == Format and structure == The podcast is informally comedic, and formatted in an improvisational style. They frequently mention supplemental running jokes, such as Loftus' obsession with actor Alfred Molina, and Durante's reminder of her Master's Degree in Screenwriting from Boston University.Bulnes, Rebecca (July 7, 2017). \"The Bechdel Cast Swoons Over Alfred Molina in its Best Episode Yet\" The A.V. Club Retrieved November 12, 2018. The hosts begin by introducing their guest, often a comedian, actor, or other media personality. Durante then briefly recaps the film at the top of the episode with interjection from Loftus and the guest. This is followed by analyzing and discussing the representation of women through an intersectional lens, alternating in tone between serious and jocular. Reghay, Nayomi (May 27, 2017). \"The Bechdel Cast Roasts Your Favorite Movie with a Hilarious, Feminist Lens\" The Daily Dot Retrieved November 12, 2018. At the end of each episode they determine whether or not the film passes the Bechdel test, as well as rate it on a \"nipple scale\" from 0 to 5 nipples based on how female-identifying characters are portrayed overall. Kukla, Becky (September 12, 2018). \"10 Feminist Podcasts We Should All Be Listening to Right Now\" Culturess Retrieved November 12, 2018. Episodes typically range from 45 minutes to 80 minutes, and are released once a week on Thursdays and twice a month on Patreon. Most episodes are recorded in the HowStuffWorks studio in Los Angeles. Within the past year they have begun touring and performing for studio audiences as The Bechdel Cast, which include live episodes such as \"The Notebook with Caitlin Gill\" and \"Edward Scissorhands with Maggie Mae Fish\". == Hosts == Caitlin Durante is a comedian and producer. She was the program producer for the Nerdmelt Showroom comedy venue at Meltdown Comics in Los Angeles from early 2015 until it closed in April 2018. She is also a scriptwriter and story analyst, and frequently offers writing workshops in Los Angeles and Boston. Jamie Loftus is a sketch writer, animator, and actor. Her comedic style can best be described as alternative comedy, with absurd pieces such as her one-woman show \"I Lost My Virginity August 15, 2010\" and her attempt to raise money for Planned Parenthood by selling Shrek nudes. She has also written and starred in video content for media sites Adult Swim, Comedy Central, Paste, and Super Deluxe. == Episodes == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Episode # !Date aired !Title !Guest !Bechdel Test !Nipple Rating: Durante, Loftus, Guest !Total Nipples |- |1 |November 27, 2016 |Welcome to the Bechdel Cast! |None |N/A |N/A |N/A |- |2 |December 1, 2016 |Kill Bill |Zach Sherwin |Yes |No ratings given |N/A |- |3 |December 8, 2016 |Beauty and the Beast (1991) |Courtney Karwal |No |2 (L) |N/A |- |4 |December 15, 2016 |Star Wars: A New Hope |Sam Jay |No |2 (D);
