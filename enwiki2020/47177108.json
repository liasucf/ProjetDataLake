    "text": "The State Basketball League (SBL) presents 6 annual awards (3 for Men's SBL and 3 for Women's SBL) to recognize its teams, players, and coaches for their accomplishments. This does not include the two championship trophies, which are given to the winning teams of the Men's SBL and Women's SBL. The SBL's first individual awards were the Most Valuable Player and the Coach of the Year, both of which were introduced in the inaugural 1989 season. The only individual award of the postseason is the Grand Final MVP. ==Team trophies== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" summary=\"Image, Award (sortable), Created (sortable), Description, Most recent winner and Notes\" !scope=\"col\"| Award !scope=\"col\"| Created !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Most recent winner |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:transparent;\"| MSBL Championship Trophy (Robert J Williams Perpetual Trophy) |align=\"center\"| 1989 |The MSBL's championship trophy; awarded to the winning team of the MSBL Grand Final. |Geraldton Buccaneers |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:transparent;\"| WSBL Championship Trophy (Len Woodlands Perpetual Trophy) |align=\"center\"| 1989 |The WSBL's championship trophy; awarded to the winning team of the WSBL Grand Final. |Rockingham Flames |} ==Honours== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" summary=\"Honor (sortable), Created (sortable), Description and Notes\" !scope=\"col\" width=15% class=\"unsortable\"| Honor !scope=\"col\"| Created !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:transparent;\"| All-Star Five |align=center| 2009 (modern day) |Two five-player teams, one from MSBL and one from WSBL, composed of the best players in the league following every SBL season. |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:transparent;\"| All-Defensive Five |align=center| 2016 |Two five-player teams, one from MSBL and one from WSBL, composed of the best defensive players in the league following every SBL season. |} ==Individual awards== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" summary=\"Award (sortable), Created (sortable), Description and Most recent winner(s)\" !scope=\"col\" width=\"22%\"| Award !scope=\"col\" width=\"1%\"| Created !scope=\"col\" width=\"50%\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description !scope=\"col\" width=\"25%\" class=\"unsortable\"| Most recent winner(s) |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:transparent;\"| Most Valuable Player |align=center| 1989 |Awarded to the best performing player of the regular season in both the Men's SBL and Women's SBL. |M: Joshua Braun (Kalamunda Eastern Suns) W: Stacey Barr (Warwick Senators) |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"background- color:transparent;\"| Grand Final MVP |align=center| 1996 (earliest known case) |Awarded to the best performing player in both the Men's SBL Grand Final and Women's SBL Grand Final. |M: Liam Hunt (Geraldton Buccaneers) W: Maddie Allen (Rockingham Flames) |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"background- color:transparent;\"| Coach of the Year |align=center| 1989 |Awarded to the best head coach of the regular season in both the Men's SBL and Women's SBL. |M: Dave Daniels (Lakeside Lightning) W: Craig Watts (Mandurah Magic) |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"background- color:transparent;\"| Most Improved Player |align=center| 2004 |Awarded to the most improved player of the regular season in both the Men's SBL and Women's SBL. |M: Luke Travers (Rockingham Flames) W: Matilda Muir (Cockburn Cougars) |- |} ==References== State Basketball League * Category:State Basketball League lists Category:Lists of sports awards ",
