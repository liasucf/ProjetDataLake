This season saw the 35 teams of Primera, divided into two groups. The top 2 of each group qualified for the final stages of the tournament, which was eventually won by Gimnasia y Esgrima (LP). The season was marred by mass abandonment of games, defending Argentine champion Hurac\u00e1n withdrew from 8 of its fixtures leaving them to finish in 14th place in the group. Several other teams withdrew from multiple games.Argentina 1929 at RSSSF Abandonments of games, discontinuations, and withdrawals were quite common in these early seasons (cf., for instance, the second half of the 1930 season Argentina 1930 at RSSSF).
