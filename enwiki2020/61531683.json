Wingfield's masque was presumably produced and performed by the family, featuring the Countess of Bedford, while Shakespeare's play was performed by professionals, the Lord Chamberlain's Men, the \"London comedians\" in Petit's phrase.Gustav Ungerer, 'An Unrecorded Elizabethan Performance of Titus Andronicus', Shakespeare Survey, vol. 14 (Cambridge, 1961), pp. 102, 104, 108.
