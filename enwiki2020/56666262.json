    "text": "Anaphlystus or Anaphlystos () was a coastal (paralia) deme of ancient Athens, belonging to the Antiochis phyle, on the west coast of Attica, opposite the island of Eleussa, and a little north of the promontory of Sunium, between that promontory and that of Astypalaea. It bordered on Aegilia to the west, to Atene in the south-east and to Amphitrope to the east. To the northwest, it was separated from Phrearrhioi by the Astike Hodos.Hans Lohmann, \"Anaphlystus\" in Brill's New Pauly (2006). It was a place of some importance. It had ten representatives in the Boule. Xenophon recommended the erection of a fortress here for the protection of the mines of Sunium. Strabo speaks of a paneium (\u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd), or Grotto of Pan, in the neighbourhood of Anaphlystus.Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax 21; Xenophon, de Vectig. 4 .43; It was situated at a site called Agios Georgios (St. George), close to the modern settlement of Anavyssos, on the Athens Riviera. ==References== Category:Ancient Athens Category:Populated places in ancient Attica Category:Former populated places in Greece Category:Demoi ",
