    "text": "Olinda Elementary is an elementary-level school located in Brea, California. == History == Olinda Elementary was first built in 1898 in what is now Carbon Canyon Regional Park, one year after the village of Olinda was founded. === Relocation === The school was moved deeper into Carbon Canyon during the mid-1960s, in what is now Olinda Village. In 2012, the Olinda Village location was scheduled for demolition and a new site was constructed at a location on Birch Street next to the City of Brea's Sports Park. This sparked concern and anger with local residents as the school had also served as a park, but was made inaccessible after being sold. == Awards == In 2006, the school was recognized as a California Distinguished School and in 2007 was recognized as a Blue Ribbon School. In 2010, the Orange County Register placed Olinda Elementary on their \"Best Schools\" list at number 10. == References == Category:Brea, California Category:Public elementary schools in California ",
