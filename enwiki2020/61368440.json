The work was released on 20 September 2019 via Napalm Records. == Background == In July 2019, the ensemble released \"Burn!\", the first single from the upcoming album. == Critical reception == Blabbermouth.net states that \"The upcoming LP sees the band imbued with a new fire that comes through by way of undeniable hooks, soaring guitar riffs, marching drum beats, and the soulful, bombastic vocal delivery of lead singer Kobra Paige\" going on to say that \"No longer bound by old formulas and expectations from the past, \"Evolution\" comes through with a sound that is expansive and, at times, borders on outright swagger\" and that \"Each song feels like an Active Rock hit in the making, while still having the grit and feverish intensity that longtime fans have come to admire from KOBRA AND THE LOTUS.\" Joe Divita of Loudwire states that \"The song drifts away from Kobra and the Lotus' metal leanings of past, digging into deep, rolling grooves of modern day hard rock\" and that \"This platform lets frontwoman Kobra Paige take the spotlight with her dominant set of pipes\". == Track listing == ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |} == References == Category:2019 albums Category:Kobra and the Lotus albums Category:Napalm Records albums ",
