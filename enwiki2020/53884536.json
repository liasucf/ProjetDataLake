    "text": "This is a list of air shows in Japan. Air shows in Japan are mostly those held at Japan Self-Defense Force and US military bases across the country. Air shows are sometimes known as festivals in Japan. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force, (JASDF) Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) and Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) all have air shows at their bases. Air shows or open days are also held at a number of US military bases in Japan. At JASDF base air shows it is common for the Blue Impulse aerobatic team to perform. The US Air Force, US Marine Corps, and US Navy also have events at their bases. Visitors who are not from the US or Japan may be turned away from a US base for security reasons. Prospective attendees of events at US bases who are neither Japanese or American should bring identification and also consult the Third Country National list to see if they require special approval to enter the base.U.S. Navy \u2018Friendship Festival\u2019 draws line at the French September 7, 2010 Japan Times Retrieved November 15, 2017 Individual event dates can vary or be cancelled during different years.
