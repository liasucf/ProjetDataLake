    "text": "The Fechheimer & White Building is a historic building located at 233 SW Naito Parkway in Portland, Oregon. Designed by an unknown architect, it was built in 1885 and features cast-iron by Willamette Iron Works. It is adjacent to the Hallock\u2013McMillan Building. In 1975, it was listed as a \"primary landmark\" in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) nomination of the Portland Skidmore/Old Town Historic District, the building's designation subsequently \"translated\" to \"contributing property\" under post-1970s NRHP terminology. The building's year of construction has been given alternatively as 1870, as opposed to 1885. (The National Historic Landmark nomination form for the Skidmore/Old Town Historic District uses both dates for the building, in separate sections, without explanation \u2013 an inconsistency.) ==References== ==External links== * * Fechheimer & White Building (Portland, Oregon), University of Oregon Libraries Category:1885 establishments in Oregon Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1885 Category:Buildings and structures in Portland, Oregon Category:Historic district contributing properties in Oregon Category:Portland Historic Landmarks Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Oregon ",
