    "text": "The Wet Gunpowder Award () is an Iranian symbolic award that according to organizers, is given to \"ridiculous people whose chaffy character is evident to everyone and when this nature of theirs is accompanied with self-belief turns into an indefinite foolishness for them\". The organizers, who have close ties to Basij and Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (The award is unveiled by Basij commander Mohammad Reza Naqdi), claim award winner is \"someone who is against the Islamic Revolution\" and who \u201cagainst their own wishes, performs a service to the revolution.\u201d The statue of the award is that of brain with dark glasses and hearing aids with a plaque of the Quranic verse: \"Unwilling to hear, unwilling to speak, unwilling to see, then, they will not return to the way.\" In 2015, they awarded a parody of Golden Bear. ==Recipients== First Lady Michelle Obama, pictured here announcing the winner of 2013 Academy Award for Best Picture, Argo, was inaugural winner.
