It has been characterised as J\u00f3n's most ambitious work, and 'in many ways the most interesting of the sagas which J\u00f3n authored, first and foremost because he was more successful here than in any other saga in combining influences from a great many different sources, local and foreign, ancient and new'.'\u00c1 margan h\u00e1tt \u00e1hugaver\u00f0ust \u00feeirra sagna sem J\u00f3ni eru eigna\u00f0ar, fyrst og fremst vegna \u00feess a\u00f0 honum tekst betur h\u00e9r en \u00ed nokkum annarri s\u00f6gu a\u00f0 tengja saman \u00e1hrif \u00far fj\u00f6lm\u00f6rgum \u00f3l\u00edkum heimildum, innlendum og erlendum, fornum og n\u00fdjum', Fj\u00f3rar s\u00f6gur fr\u00e1 hendi J\u00f3ns Oddssonar Hjaltal\u00edn, ed. by M.

Driscoll, > Jarl Addon\u00edus of Dalmar\u00eda has five sons, Abel, Endor, Dathan, S\u00edmon and > Krist\u00f3fer, whom he has instructed in the arts and sciences, sports and > languages, in all of which they excel. The earl, who is himself a Christian, > sees that the brothers are attracted to a variety of religious beiefs, and > asks each to explain what beliefs he holds. Abel, the eldest, says he > follows the religion preached by Zoroaster, Endor claims to believe in > \u00d3\u00f0inn, Dathan in Muhammad, and S\u00edmon in Judaism, which Krist\u00f3fer, the most > intelligent and learned of the brothers, says he is a follower of the > teachings of Jesus Christ. Addon\u00edus decides that each of the brothers should > journey to the land where his religion is practised, spend seven years there > learning about the religion in question[,] and then return home to tell the > others what he has discovered. The saga then follows each of the brothers in > turn, ending with Krist\u00f3fer, who, not surprisingly, is the most > successful.Fj\u00f3rar s\u00f6gur fr\u00e1 hendi J\u00f3ns Oddssonar Hjaltal\u00edn, ed. by M.

J\u00f3n's sources include prominently the Old Norse V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 and Heimskringla and the Almindelig Kirke-Historie and Helte-Historier by Ludvig Holberg, while the overall premise of comparing religions, seems to be inspired by Zadig, by Voltaire, which J\u00f3n also adapted into Icelandic.Fj\u00f3rar s\u00f6gur fr\u00e1 hendi J\u00f3ns Oddssonar Hjaltal\u00edn, ed. by M.
