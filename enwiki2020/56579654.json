NASA confirms that bed rest experiments were conducted, but never involved marijuana. Facebook refuted the viral story as part of its efforts to combat fake news. The hoax may have been spun from a real 2014 news story by VICE columnist Andrew Iwanicki in which he documented his experience as a NASA bed-rest test subject. ==References== Category:2016 hoaxes Category:2018 hoaxes Category:Cannabis hoaxes Category:Fake news ",
