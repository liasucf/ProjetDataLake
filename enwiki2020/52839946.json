It is found as a patronym in the form of \u00d3 Muireadhaigh and MacMuireadhaigh, which have been anglicised as Murray and Morrow in southwestern Scotland, northeastern Connacht and County Cavan. The name Morrow is found primarily in Donegal, Antrim, Down and Armagh which is due to Scottish settlement in those areas. ==See also== * List of Irish-language given names ==References== Category:Gaelic-language given names ",
