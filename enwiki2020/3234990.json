    "text": "The Terascale Open-source Resource and QUEue Manager (TORQUE) TORQUE resource manager, Garrick Staples, SC '06: Proceedings of the 2006 ACM/IEEE conference on Supercomputing, is a distributed resource manager providing control over batch jobs and distributed compute nodes. TORQUE can integrate with the non- commercial Maui Cluster Scheduler or the commercial Moab Workload Manager to improve overall utilization, scheduling and administration on a cluster. The TORQUE community has extended the original PBS to extend scalability, fault tolerance, and functionality. Contributors include NCSA, OSC, USC, the US DOE, Sandia, PNNL, UB, TeraGrid, and other HPC organizations. As of June 2018, TORQUE is no longer open-source even though previously it was described by its developers as open-source software, using the OpenPBS version 2.3 license and as non-free software by the Debian Free Software Guidelines due to license issues. ==Feature set== TORQUE provides enhancements over standard OpenPBS in the following areas: * Fault Tolerance ** Additional failure conditions checked/handled ** Node health check script support * Scheduling Interface ** Extended query interface providing the scheduler with additional and more accurate information ** Extended control interface allowing the scheduler increased control over job behavior and attributes ** Allows the collection of statistics for completed jobs * Scalability ** Significantly improved server to MOM communication model ** Ability to handle larger clusters (over 15 TF/2,500 processors) ** Ability to handle larger jobs (over 2000 processors) ** Ability to support larger server messages * Usability ** Extensive logging additions ** More human readable logging (i.e. no more 'error 15038 on command 42') ==See also== * * Beowulf cluster * HTCondor * Maui Cluster Scheduler * Open Source Cluster Application Resources (OSCAR) * Slurm Workload Manager * Univa Grid Engine ==References== ==External links== * * OpenPBS home page Category:Computational science Category:Job scheduling ",
