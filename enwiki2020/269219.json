    "text": "Jan \u0160vankmajer (; born 4 September 1934) is a Czech retired filmmaker and artist whose work spans several media. He is a self-labeled surrealist known for his animations and features, which have greatly influenced other artists such as Terry Gilliam, the Brothers Quay, and many others. == Life and career == ===Early life === He was born in Prague. An early influence on his later artistic development was a puppet theatre he was given for Christmas as a child. He studied at the College of Applied Arts in Prague and later in the Department of Puppetry at the Prague Academy of Performing Arts, where he befriended Juraj Herz. He contributed to Emil Radok's film Johanes doctor Faust in 1958 and then began working for Prague's Semafor Theatre where he founded the Theatre of Masks. He then moved on to the Laterna Magika multimedia theatre, where he renewed his association with Radok. ===As a filmmaker=== This theatrical experience is reflected in \u0160vankmajer's first film The Last Trick, which was released in 1964. Under the influence of theoretician Vratislav Effenberger, \u0160vankmajer moved from the mannerism of his early work to classic surrealism, first manifested in his film The Garden (1968), and joined the Czechoslovak Surrealist Group.Jan \u0160vankmajer: The Complete Short Films. BFI Booklet. \u0160vankmajer has gained a reputation over several decades for his distinctive use of stop-motion technique, and his ability to make surreal, nightmarish, and yet somehow funny pictures. \u0160vankmajer's trademarks include very exaggerated sounds, often creating a very strange effect in all eating scenes. He often uses fast-motion sequences when people walk or interact. His movies often involve inanimate objects being brought to \"life\" through stop motion. Many of his films also include clay objects in stop motion, otherwise known as claymation. Food is a common subject and medium. \u0160vankmajer also uses pixilation in many of his films, including Food (1992) and Conspirators of Pleasure (1996). Stop-motion features in most of his work, though his feature films have included much more live action sequences than animation. Many of his movies, like the short film Down to the Cellar, are made from a child's perspective, while at the same time often having a truly disturbing and even aggressive nature. In 1972 the communist authorities banned him from making films, and many of his later films were suppressed. He was almost unknown in the West until the early 1980s. Writing in The New York Times, Andrew Johnston praised \u0160vankmajer's artistry, stating \"while his films are rife with cultural and scientific allusions, his unusual imagery possesses an accessibility that feels anchored in the shared language of the subconscious, making his films equally rewarding to the culturally hyperliterate and to those who simply enjoy visual stimulation.\"New York Times ,1 July 2001 Thoroughfare in Knov\u00edz, Kladno District, Czech Republic. The former cinema building on the right: Jan \u0160vankmajer's studio Among his best known works are the feature films Alice (1988), Faust (1994), Conspirators of Pleasure (1996), Little Otik (2000) and Lunacy (2005), a surreal comic horror based on two works of Edgar Allan Poe and the life of Marquis de Sade. The two stories by Poe, \"The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\" and \"The Premature Burial\", provide Lunacy its thematic focus, whereas the life of Marquis de Sade provides the film's blasphemy. His short film Dimensions of Dialogue (1982) was selected by Terry Gilliam as one of the ten best animated films of all time. His films have been called \"as emotionally haunting as Kafka's stories.\" In 2010 he released Surviving Life, a live-action and cutout animation story about a married man who meets another woman in his dreams. His most recent release is called Insects (Hmyz). It had a projected budget of 40 million CZK, which was partially funded through an Indiegogo campaign which reached more than double its goal, and was released in January 2018. The film is based on the play Pictures from the Insects' Life by Josef and Karel \u010capek, which \u0160vankmajer describes as following: \"From the Life of Insects is a misanthropic play. My screenplay only extends this misanthropy, as man is more like an insect and this civilisation is more like an anthill. One should also remember the message in Kafka\u2019s Metamorphosis.\" His life's works, inimitable style and voice have had far reaching influences on the world of animation. Those whose working practice he has influence on included Brothers Quay, Caroline Leaf, Vera Neubauer, Terry Gilliam, Tomasz Bagi\u0144ski, Nina Gantz and Phil Lord and Christopher Miller among many others. In 2000, \u0160vankmajer received Lifetime Achievement Award at the World Festival of Animated Film - Animafest Zagreb. On 27 July 2013 he received the Innovation & Creativity Prize by Circolino dei Films, an independent Italian cultural organization. On 10 July 2014, he received the 2014 FIAF Award during a special ceremony of the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. On 27 September 2018, he received the Raymond Roussel Society Medal in recognition of his extraordinary contribution: an inspiring, unique and universal work. He was married to Eva \u0160vankmajerov\u00e1, an internationally known surrealist painter, ceramicist, and writer until her death in October 2005. \u0160vankmajerov\u00e1 collaborated on several of her husband's movies, including Alice, Faust, and Otes\u00e1nek. They had two children, Veronika (b. 1963) and V\u00e1clav (b. 1975, an animator). ==Filmography== ===Feature-length films=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year !! English title !! Original title !!
