    "text": "\"Masochistic Beauty\" is a song by American soul singer Marvin Gaye, released posthumously in 1985 by Columbia Records. ==Background== Unlike the majority of Gaye's music, the song is a dedication to S&M;, which was something that Gaye was known to have an interest in. The lyrics find Gaye playing the role of a dominatrix in a faux British accent where he raps throughout the track. The song shares some similarities to \"Sanctified Lady, receiving vocoder work from Gordon Banks, and having an electro-funk flavor. Both controversial tracks were also unfinished outtakes from the Midnight Love sessions, which received later work from Gordon Banks, and were released on the posthumous Dream of a Lifetime album. ==Credits== *Lead vocals by Marvin Gaye and Gordon Banks (vocoder) *Instrumentation by Marvin Gaye and Gordon Banks *Produced by Gordon Banks ==References== Category:Songs written by Marvin Gaye Category:Marvin Gaye songs Category:Song recordings produced by Gordon Banks (musician) Category:Songs released posthumously Category:1985 songs Category:Songs about BDSM ",
