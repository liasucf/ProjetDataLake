The Pilgrim is a replica of the tall ship that Richard Henry Dana, Jr. sailed onboard into Dana Point in the 1830s. Tall ship programs simulate the experience of a sailor in the 1830s. The Pilgrim and Spirit of Dana Point are showcased at the Institute's largest annual event, the Toshiba Tall Ships Festival, held in September. It draws seven or eight tall ships from up and down the coast, and features pirates, singing, cannon battles and a chance to sail on a tall ship. The replica of the Pilgrim was demolished in April 2020 after sinking. ==Annual budget== The Ocean Institute has an annual budget of $6 million, and employs 100 full and part-time staff members, as well utilizing the services of hundreds of volunteers. Professional partners include the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the National Science Foundation and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Supporters include the Swenson Family Foundation, the Henry Samueli Foundation, Quiksilver and KOCE, among others. Dan Pingaro serves as the Institute's president and CEO. It is funded through school visitations, state and city grants, as well as gifts from local philanthropists.
