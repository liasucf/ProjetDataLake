    "text": "Elections to the United States House of Representatives were held in 1880 for Representatives to the 47th Congress, and coincided with the 1880 presidential election which was won by James A. Garfield, who was a member of the House at the time. Issues such as Civil War loyalties, tariffs, graft and corruption dominated the year's elections, though none became substantive a national issue. The economy was growing stronger after emerging from a long Depression. It was in this political environment that Garfield's Republican Party gained 19 seats and regained control of the House from the Democratic Party. The Greenback Party, an emerging party of workers and farmers, also lost seats in these elections, after gaining more than a dozen two years earlier. ==Election summaries== {| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center\" |+ \u2193 |- style=\"color:white\" | style=\"background:; width:44.71%\" | 131 | style=\"background:; width:3.41%\" | 10 | style=\"background:; width:51.54%\" | 151 |- | Democratic | Gb | Republican |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- valign=bottom ! rowspan=2 | State ! rowspan=2 | Type ! rowspan=2 | Total seats ! colspan=2 | Democratic ! colspan=2 | Greenback ! colspan=2 | Republican |- ! | Seats ! | Change ! | Seats ! | Change ! | Seats ! | Change |- !

In 1880, no states held their elections after Election Day for the first time (California was the last state to hold late elections, in 1878).
