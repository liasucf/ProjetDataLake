P., and Celio Henrique Ribeiro. \"Twenty-one new species of Parmeliaceae (lichenized fungi) from southeastern Brazil.\" Mitt. Inst. Allg. Bot. Hamburg 30.32 (2002): 125\u2013155 (see p. 129). This species is very similar to the apostulate Canoparmelia caroliniana, showing the same colour, size and reticulate maculae. C. caroliniana, however, has true isidia. Big coralloid pustules that in some cases become sorediate are a characteristic feature for C. albomaculata. ==Description== It possesses a whitish-green thallus that measures wide, its adnate lobes measuring between wide. Its surface is smooth and irregularly cracked. The species' ramification is irregularly dichotomous, with rounded apices, an oval axillary sinus, and a black-lined margin with no cilia. It shows no lacinules while possessing laminal maculae. Its pustulae are found as marginal and submarginal, its coralloid being isidioid, at times exhibiting granular soredia apically. Its medulla is white, while its underside possesses a rugose and veined light brown center, as well as a rugose, veined and papillate margin. Its rhizinae are simple, measuring between long, being coloured brown and being few in number. Apothecia and pycnidia are absent in Canoparmelia albomaculata. ==Habitat== This species was first found in the Parque Natural do Cara\u00e7a, in Minas Gerais, at an altitude of on a tree in a light forest. ==References== ==Further reading== *Spielmann, Adriano Afonso, and Marcelo Pinto Marcelli. \"Parmeliaceae (Ascomycota liquenizados) nos barrancos e peraus da encosta da Serra Geral, Vale do Rio Pardo, Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil.
