From 2016, the 25-member unicameral Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly is elected from five multi-member electorates, with five seats per electorate. ==History== thumb|Map of the electorates from 1995 to 2016 Electorate boundaries for Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly elections have changed a number of times since the first ACT election in 1989. For the 1989 and 1992 elections, the ACT comprised one electorate, electing seventeen members to the Assembly. Prior to the 1995 ACT general election, three multi-member electorates were established and have remained in place, with boundary and redistribution changes made prior to the 2001 and 2008 ACT general elections. On 30 April 2002, the ACT Electoral Commission made a submission to the ACT Legislative Assembly's Standing Committee on Legal Affairs, which inquired into the appropriateness of the size of the Legislative Assembly for the ACT and options for changing the number of members, electorates and other related matters. The Electoral Commission recommended increasing \"the size of the Legislative Assembly to three (3) electorates each returning seven (7) Members, giving a total of twenty-one (21) Members\". The Assembly has not made any changes to either its size (number of members) or the number of electorates. ==Electorates== ===Current electorates=== This is a list of electorates for the 2016 ACT general election: ====Brindabella==== Electing five members to the Assembly, Brindabella contains the town centre and all of the suburbs of Tuggeranong excluding Kambah.
