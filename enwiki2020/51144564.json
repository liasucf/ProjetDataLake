It is considered one of the best heroic poetry of Old Gujarati which is mixed with Avahatatha, the artificial literary speech of court poets. He may have personally witnessed the battle. It is also historical work as its veracity can be verified by contemporary Muslim chronicles. The poem starts with ten Sanskrit verses followed by 60 Gujarati verses full of words of Persian and Arabic origin. It employs words with consonants to produce heroic feelings. His description of battle, characterization of hero and metrical patterns made it unique in Gujarati literature. His Dasham Skandh is a Gujarati version of the 10th book of Bhagavata Purana.
