Now serving general aviation, it was once Hungary's only international airport. ==History== Until the opening of Buda\u00f6rs, Budapest's main airport was M\u00e1ty\u00e1sf\u00f6ld Airfield (), east of Budapest. This was a very small airfield, and a replacement was established at Buda\u00f6rs, at the south-western limit of Budapest's city boundary. Planning for the airport started in 1935, and in 1936, design competitions for the terminal and main hangar were held. Construction started the same year, and the terminal was completed in 232 days, being opened on 20 June 1937. The main architect of the terminal was Virgil Bierbauer (), and it is considered one of his finest works. Its grand main hall was particularly noteworthy. The building still exists, but is not accessible to the public. The main hangar was also completed in 1937. With dimensions of by , it was the largest hangar in Europe at the time. It is still in use today. The terminal and the main hangar are protected historical monuments. The airfield was completed in the summer of 1937, immediately becoming the main and the only international airport of Hungary, and the home base of Malert (the forerunner airline of Maszovlet, which later became Mal\u00e9v Hungarian Airlines). ==Airlines and routes== The services operated in the summer of 1938 are shown here: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Company !Route !Notes |- |Air France |Belgrade \u2014 Bucharest | |- |Air France |Vienna \u2014 Prague \u2014 Strasbourg \u2014 Paris | |- |Ala Littoria |Vienna \u2014 Venice \u2014 Rome | |- |Czech Airlines |Bratislava | |- |Deutsche Luft Hansa |Belgrade \u2014 Athens \u2014 Rhodes \u2014 Damascus \u2014 Baghdad \u2014 Tehran | |- |Deutsche Luft Hansa |Belgrade \u2014 Sofia \u2014 Salonica \u2014 Athens | |- |Deutsche Luft Hansa |Berlin | |- |Deutsche Luft Hansa |Bucharest | |- |Deutsche Luft Hansa |Vienna \u2014 Berlin | |- |KLM |Athens \u2014 Batavia | |- |KLM |Leipzig \u2014 Amsterdam | |- |KLM |Vienna \u2014 Prague \u2014 Rotterdam \u2014 London | |- |MALERT |Arad \u2014 Bucharest |In pool |- |MALERT |Prague | |- |MALERT |Vienna \u2014 Saltsburg \u2014 Munich \u2014 Zurich | |- |MALERT |Warsaw | |} A service from Heston via Frankfurt was started by British Airways Ltd in April 1939, using Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra aircraft. By 1950, Malert had been replaced by Maszovlet, 51% owned by the USSR, which operated services to Bratislava, Prague, Bucharest and Venice. Other airlines operating into Buda\u00f6rs were Aeroflot, Czech Airlines, KLM, JAT Jugoslovenski Aerotransport, LOT Polish Airlines, and Transadriatica. ==End of airline service== The need for the replacement of Buda\u00f6rs by a larger airport had been clear since 1939. Hills surrounding Buda\u00f6rs Airport, a lack of room for expansion, and the need for longer, hard runways led the development of what would become Budapest Ferihegy International Airport. Ferihegy was ready in 1943, but bombing during World War 2 caused extensive damage to it. As Buda\u00f6rs had survived the war relatively intact, it continued its service as the primary international airport until repairs at Ferihegy were completed. Ferihegy was reopened on 7 May 1950, and a Lisunov Li-2 flew in from Buda\u00f6rs to mark the occasion. Terminal building in 2012 All international services transferred from Buda\u00f6rs shortly afterwards, and recreational flying and parachuting activities which had gone on at Ferihegy moved to Buda\u00f6rs. ==Current operations== Buda\u00f6rs is now an active general aviation airport, with many light aircraft and gliders based there. It is home of several recreational- and flight training businesses, as well as of the Goldtimer Foundation, which restores and regularly gives passenger rides on its vintage aircraft, like the Lisunov Li-2, Polikarpov Po-2, Rubik R-18 K\u00e1nya and the Rubik R-11b Cimbora. ==References== ==External links== * Official website * Goldtimer Foundation Category:1937 establishments in Hungary Category:Airports established in 1937 Category:Airports in Hungary Category:Transport in Budapest Category:History of Budapest ",
