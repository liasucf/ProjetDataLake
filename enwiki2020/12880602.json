    "text": "The Merrie Men of Sherwood Forest, or Forest Days in the Olden Time is a pastoral operetta in three acts. The words and music were written by W. H. Birch and the work was published by John Blockley of Argyll Street, London. ==Performance history== In 1871 it was performed in concert by the Doncaster Musical Society, and then again in 1872. A critic noted the derivative nature of the work, remarking that it was \"suggestive of others\". As with many of Blockley's operettas, the work could be performed free of charge. ==Roles== *Robin Hood (tenor) *Marian (soprano) *Little John (bass) *Will Scarlet (baritone) *Friar Tuck (bass) *Much the Miller's son (tenor) *Holy Palmer (bass) *Sheriff of Nottingham (bass) *Chorus of maidens and foresters ==External links== * Article on Robin Hood in music Category:English-language operettas Category:Operas Category:Robin Hood music ",
