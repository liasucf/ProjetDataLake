The team is currently playing in Division 2 \u00d6stra G\u00f6taland. Several well known players have played at the club including England international striker Peter Crouch as well as Swedish footballers Jon J\u00f6nsson, Andreas Dahl, and Tobias Linderoth. In recent years the club has played in Division 2, which is the fourth tier of the Swedish football league system. However, the club has played in second tier football (Division 1 S\u00f6dra and Division 2 S\u00f6dra) in 1972\u20131974, 1975\u201381, 1987\u20131988, and 1992\u20131998. ==Background== The club was first established by factory owners and football enthusiast Knut Rydlund in 1905. When the club first started, the team played at Linnaeus Flats until G\u00f6inge Vallen was built in 1910. During the 1910s, IFK H\u00e4ssleholm was considered to be one of the best football clubs in Sweden In 1918, the team won the Scanian Championship. By the 1920s, the team slid down into Division 2. The club was hurting financially and in 1928, the club had to take out loans. Over the years, the team has struggled to maintain its former glory. In the 1930s, the club added a handball team which was fairly successful. The handball team was outshining the football team at this point in time. However, World War II broke up the football team. Once the team resumed playing, it was no longer able to compete in Division 2. The franchise therefore focused on handball. In 1948, the handball side won the Scanian Championship but the team had disintegrated by 1980. Despite the initial success of handball, football once again made its way back to the top in the 1950s. The team successful landed back in the Division 2 again. In 1962, the franchise built a club house on Svedje Mark Street. With some success in the 1970s, the construction of a new playing facility was erected called \u00d6ster\u00e5s IP which has a capacity of 6,000. Following that, the club won the 1972 Sk\u00e5ne North East with players such as Bo Nilsson. In 1973, the team came in third place and in 1974 the team took part in their first qualifier.http://hem.ifkhassleholm.se/ The best years of the club were undoubtedly from 1991\u20131993. In 1991, the team returned to Division 1 and by 1993 nearly reached Allsvenskan. The team's success boosted crowds up to 8,500, 1,500 fans over capacity. In the year 2000 there was a dramatic change in the club after Peter Crouch and Alton Thelwell were loaned from Tottenham Hotspur. Their loan brought new attention to the club resulting in Jon J\u00f6nsson being signed by Spurs. IFK H\u00e4ssleholm are affiliated to the Sk\u00e5nes Fotbollf\u00f6rbund. Local rivals H\u00e4ssleholms IF play in the same division. In recent years, the club has been a base for many South African players coming to Sweden, to acclimatize them before moving on to other Swedish clubs. The most notable example is Tokelo Rantie in Malm\u00f6 FF, but players such as May Mahlangu and Ayanda Nkili have also played here. ==Season to season== {| |valign=\"top\" width=0%| {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#f0f6fa;\" !Season !Level !Division !Section !Position !Movements |- |1993 |Tier 2 |Division 1 |S\u00f6dra | 2nd |Promotion Playoffs |- |1994 |Tier 2 |Division 1 |S\u00f6dra | 3rd | |- |1995 |Tier 2 |Division 1 |S\u00f6dra | 8th | |- |1996 |Tier 2 |Division 1 |S\u00f6dra | 6th | |- |1997 |Tier 2 |Division 1 |S\u00f6dra | 7th | |- |1998 |Tier 2 |Division 1 |S\u00f6dra | 12th | Relegated |- |1999 |Tier 3 |Division 2 |S\u00f6dra G\u00f6taland |4th | |- |2000 |Tier 3 |Division 2 |S\u00f6dra G\u00f6taland |10th |Relegation Playoffs \u2013 Relegated |- |2001 |Tier 4 | Division 3 | S\u00f6dra G\u00f6taland |1st | Promoted |- |2002 |Tier 3 |Division 2 |S\u00f6dra G\u00f6taland |4th | |- |2003 |Tier 3 |Division 2 |S\u00f6dra G\u00f6taland |8th | |- |2004 |Tier 3 |Division 2 |S\u00f6dra G\u00f6taland |3rd | |- |2005 |Tier 3 |Division 2 |S\u00f6dra G\u00f6taland |3rd | |- |2006* |Tier 3 |Division 1 |S\u00f6dra |13th |Relegated |- |2007 |Tier 4 | Division 2 | S\u00f6dra G\u00f6taland |7th | |- |2008 |Tier 4 | Division 2 | S\u00f6dra G\u00f6taland |5th | |- |2009 |Tier 4 | Division 2 | S\u00f6dra G\u00f6taland |6th | |- |2010 |Tier 4 | Division 2 | \u00d6stra G\u00f6taland |10th |Relegation Playoffs \u2013 Relegated |- |2011 |Tier 5 | Division 3 | Sydv\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland | | |} * League restructuring in 2006 resulted in a new division being created at Tier 3 and subsequent divisions dropping a level. |} ==Achievements== ===League=== * Division 1 S\u00f6dra: ** Runners-up (1): 1993 ==References== ==External links== * IFK H\u00e4ssleholm \u2013 Official website Category:Football clubs in Sweden Category:Sport in Sk\u00e5ne County Category:Association football clubs established in 1905 Category:1905 establishments in Sweden Category:Idrottsf\u00f6reningen Kamraterna ",
