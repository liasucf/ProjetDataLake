It was founded in 1992 as Gallium Visual Systems Inc. and purchased in 2006 by Norwegian Defence firm Kongsberg Gruppen.https://www.kongsberggeospatial.com/company/news- media/27-kongsberg-gallium-announces-name-change-now-kongsberg-geospatial It currently operates as a subsidiary of Kongsberg Defence & AerospaceKongsberg - Buys Gallium Software of Canada and in 2012, officially changed its name to Kongsberg Gallium Ltd.Northrop Grumman Corporation Law Department In 2016, the company changed its name again to Kongsberg Geospatial. Their current office is located in the Kanata Research Park with many other high tech and IT companies. Kongsberg Geospatial primarily sells to the defence market, but has also created software for Air Traffic Management, Air Traffic Control Simulation and Training, and Vessel Traffic Management applications. Its primary customers are government and military, or prime contractors. ==Products== Kongsberg Geospatial offers a family of software development kit (SDK) products directly to customers or uses them as the basis for turn-key solutions and applications. The company also sells standalone applications for Air Traffic Control training and simulation and for operating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS). *TerraLens: TerraLens (formerly InterMAPhics) was first created in 1992 as one of Gallium Visual Systems first products. It is a software development kit used for the development of custom user interface and real-time mapping applications. It can use a variety of map formats and platforms to provide Situational Awareness and Geospatial Visualization information.Army Selects InterMAPhics as its Mapping Engine for JBC-P The SDK is currently in its 8th generation and is used as the basis of many of the company's applications. *IRIS UAS IRIS UAS is a standalone application created to provide UAV pilots with spatial awareness and warning of airspace conflicts when piloting UAVs beyond visual line-of-sight. *InterCOM DDS Intercom DDS is an open standard middleware for data distribution. It is built to allow developers to define and share real time data across systems, networks, platforms and processors. Kongsberg Geospatial participates in DDS standards groups created by the Object Management Group. As such, InterCOM DDS can be used with any OMG RTPS protocol compliant device. *ISIM ISIM is an Air Traffic Control Trainer used for Air Traffic Control Training, Air Space Analysis, HMI Development, and UAV integration. It was developed to provide the radar simulation for the US National Airspace System (NAS). It is the only system that uses the same display and user interface as the automation systems in FAA air traffic control centers. It is based on InterMAPhics. ==Notable projects== Over 20 years, Kongsberg Geospatial has provided software to a number of projects, including: Air *U.S. Army Theatre High Altitude Air Defense *Finnish Air Defense System *Polish Coastal Air Defense System *Japanese Ballistic Missile Defense System *NATO Airborne Warning and Control System *NATO Advanced Early Warning & Control System *Triton & Firescout UAV Ground Control Stations *AN/TPS-70 Air Defense Radar System *NASAMS (Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile System) *Drone SAR Canada Naval *U.S. Navy Aegis *U.S. Navy Littoral Combat Ship *Spanish Navy F105 Aegis *Japanese Aegis Modernization *Canadian Patrol Frigate *Australian Air Warfare Destroyer *Norwegian Ula Class Submarine *Canadian Navy SIRIUS Sensor Land *Army Battle Management System *USMC AN/TPS-80 Ground / Air Task Oriented Radar *US Army Joint Battle Command PlatformArmy Selects InterMAPhics as its Mapping Engine for JBC-P *Vehicle Integrated Combat System *Aegis Ashore *Air Traffic Management Systems *Carrier and Amphibious Air Traffic Control System *Nav Canada Canadian Automated Air Traffic System *Raytheon AutoTrac III ATM system *Telephonics Aerotrac ATM System *UK NATS Scottish Oceanic System Air Traffic Control Simulation and Training *FAA CAMI Advanced ATC Research Simulator *FAA Air Space Design Team *USN Carrier Embedded ATC Trainer http://www.norfolknavyflagship.com/news/quarterdeck/carl-vinson-unveils-new- carrier-air-traffic-control- simulator/article_1fbd0ab8-f5ec-11e5-bb68-fb66809062fb.html *Community College of Beaver County *Middle Georgia College Surveillance *Vessel Traffic Management System *Port Surveillance C2 system *Off Shore Oil Field Situational Awareness *PAL Airborne Maritime Patrol System *U.S. Coast Guard National Security Cutter ==Community involvement== Kongsberg Geospatial contributes to The Ottawa Hospital, and over the past six years, has raised over $250,000.Kongsberg Gallium White Coat Campaign In 2014, these efforts resulted in a Best Ottawa Business Award for Philanthropic Initiative of the Year. == Partnership == In 2019, Kongsberg Geospatial and AiRXOS partner for the management to provide automated, unmanned traffic control systems across essential infrastructure.
