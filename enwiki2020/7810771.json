S. Achuthanandan. This 433-metre bridge was constructed at a cost of Rs.4.59 crores and was a boon for the frequent travellers through the national Highway 17 from Kozhikode to Kannur. ==The New Vengalam Junction== Vengalam township has risen to importance because of the completion of the new road from Idimuzhikkal at Ramanattukara to Vengalam with a 30 meter width.
