It was made at Walton Studios.Wood p.69 Michael Powell worked on the screenplay and (uncredited) was involved with the technical side of direction. ==Cast== * Hermione Baddeley as Polly Eccles * Nora Swinburne as Esther Eccles * Alan Napier as Capt. Hawtree * Sebastian Shaw as Hon. George d'Alroy * Ben Field as Albert Eccles * Edward Chapman as Sam Gerridge * Mabel Terry-Lewis as Marquise * Percival Coyte ==Critical reception== Film historian Geoff Brown writes, \"most of the film\u2019s enlivening spice comes from the jolting surprises of tone and manner as Gullan\u2019s cast and Powell\u2019s visuals glide or lurch through a scenario pleasingly punctured with camera trackings, lively spots of audiovisual montage and dramatically piquant closeups. (Watch for the carefully judged shots of hands delivering and receiving a crucial telegram regarding D\u2019Alroy\u2019s fate.)...the film is not a fossil; it is a lively embryo, and the first important step towards Powell\u2019s future.\" ==References== ==Bibliography== * Low, Rachael.
