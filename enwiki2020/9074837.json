    "text": "C\u00e9lestine Hitiura Vaite (born 1966) is a French Polynesian writer. ==Early life== The daughter of a Tahitian mother and a French father, Vaite grew up in the commune of Faaa (Faa'a) on the island of Tahiti, French Polynesia. In her youth, Vaite grew up immersed in traditional storytelling. Having won a scholarship to a leading girls' school in Papeete (Pape'ete), she became interested in works by French authors like Balzac, Flaubert, Zola and Maupassant. ==Career== Though a native French speaker, Vaite notably writes in English. She began to write out of homesickness while pregnant with her third child in Australia. Vaite has stated that writing in English gives her a wider audience as well as a greater creative freedom. Her first three novels\u2014Breadfruit, Frangipani, and Tiare\u2014follow Materena Mahi, a \"professional cleaner\" who lives in Faaa. The novels describe life in contemporary Tahiti from an inside perspective, through anecdotes and often with great humor. Vaite thus brings attention on a region of the world that Western literature has relegated to travel guides or often described in exotic terms. Her first two novels have been translated into French. L'arbre \u00e0 pain, the French translation of Breadfruit, was warmly greeted in French Polynesia, where it was awarded the Prix litt\u00e9raire des \u00e9tudiants by the students of the University of French Polynesia in 2004. L'arbre \u00e0 pain is also reputed to be the most widely read book in French Polynesia. Frangipani, which has been published in 14 countries to date, was shortlisted for the 2005 NSW Premier's Literary Awards and longlisted for the 2006 Orange Prize. ==Personal life== Vaite currently lives in New South Wales, Australia, and has four children. She is the mother of ex model, athlete and survivor of a forest fire Turia Pitt. She is amicably separated from her husband. == Bibliography == * Breadfruit, 2000, Winner of the Prix litt\u00e9raire des \u00e9tudiants 2004 * Frangipani, 2004 * Tiare, 2006 == References == * \"C\u00e9lestine Hitiura Vaite.\" 22 January 2006. https://web.archive.org/web/20060414014747/http://celestinevaite.com/ * Vaite, C\u00e9lestine Hitiura.
