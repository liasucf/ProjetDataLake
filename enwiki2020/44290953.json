    "text": "The Samba rebellion was a purported slave rebellion, described by the French historian Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz in his Histoire de la Louisiane. The revolt is said to have taken place in 1731, in what was then French Louisiana. Contemporary with the Natchez revolt, it was personified to its alleged leader, a slave called Samba Bambara (a member of the Bambara people from West Africa). While Le Page du Pratz gives a brief recollection of the events, which was more a conspiracy to revolt rather than an actual revolt, his information is not verified by any existent official documents. The African- born Samba is reported to have participated in a number of revolts back in Africa, and during transit to Louisiana. He is also presented by Le Page du Pratz as having served the French as an interpreter, and a slave overseer. The insurrection was due to take place in June 1731, but is said to have been revealed to the colonial authorities after an argument between an enslaved woman and a drunken French marine. Le Page du Pratz, according to himself, participated in arresting the involved slaves. While Samba refused to reveal any information even under torture, eight other slaves did not. All involved individuals were publicly executed on Place d'Armes, Jackson Square in New Orleans. The sole woman involved was hanged, while the men were killed by use of the breaking wheel. In 1936, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People of W. E. B. Du Bois wrote in its magazine The Crisis that the plan of the slaves was to kill all the whites, and enslave all other African slaves not members of the Bambara people. ==See also== * History of slavery * Atlantic slave trade * 1733 slave insurrection ==References== Category:1731 in North America Category:18th-century rebellions Category:18th century in New France Category:Conflicts in 1731 Category:Bamana Category:Events in New France Category:History of slavery in Louisiana Category:Slave rebellions in North America Category:1731 in New France Category:Louisiana (New France) ",
