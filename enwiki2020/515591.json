    "text": "Louis Segond (May 3, 1810 - June 18, 1885) was a Swiss theologian who translated the Bible into French from the original texts in Hebrew and Greek. He was born in Plainpalais, near Geneva. After studying theology in Geneva, Strasbourg and Bonn, he was pastor of the Geneva National Church in Ch\u00eane- Bougeries, then from 1872, Professor of Old Testament in Geneva. The translation of the Old Testament, commissioned by the V\u00e9n\u00e9rable Compagnie des Pasteurs de Gen\u00e8ve, was published in two volumes in 1871 (Meusel has 1874 as the publication date), followed by the New Testament, translated as a private venture, in 1880. The text was then reviewed by experts. A revised edition was commissioned for and published by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1910. ==External links== * Unabridged book-by-book 1910 revision of Segond's translation of the Bible vargenau.free.fr * Various options for downloading or searching www.awmach.org * Free audiobook of Louis Segond's Version at www.bibvoice.org * Bible Louis Segond Bible en fran\u00e7ais, lecture en ligne. * * Category:Translators of the Bible into French Category:People from Geneva Category:Swiss Protestant theologians Category:1810 births Category:1885 deaths Category:19th-century translators ",
