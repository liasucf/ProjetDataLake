    "text": "Anglogitat is a settlement in Kenya's Turkana County. == Economy == The highlands provide adequate rainfall for farming and agriculture which is the economic base of the residents of the Rift Valley. Tea from the highlands in the Kericho district enjoy a worldwide reputation, but horticulture is an important part of the district's economy and cattle raising is also practised to a large extent. The full economic potential of the Rift valley region is, however, far from fully exploited, though the current growth in population and improved education may change this in a near future. People in the province are still mostly rural, but urbanisation is gradually increasing; new cities and towns contain the rural-urban migration and, provided the right policies are instituted, the Rift Valley province will be able to emerge as a national economic and cultural hub. == History == Before the Kenyan general election in 2013, Anglogitat voted as part of the Rift Valley Province. == References == Category:Populated places in Rift Valley Province ",
