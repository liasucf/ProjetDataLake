    "text": "It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown is the sixth prime-time animated television special based on the popular comic strip Peanuts, created by Charles M. Schulz. It was directed by Bill Mel\u00e9ndez and originally aired on CBS on September 27, 1969. ==Plot== School is out for the summer and Charlie, Linus, Schroeder, and Pig Pen are planning to spend it reading every comic book, watching television, playing baseball, and playing classical music. However, Lucy tells them that she signed them up for camp. The girls are eager to go, but the boys hate the idea. The boys shove each other to get on the bus, while the girls line up in order. At camp, Charlie is chosen as captain of the boys' camp. The boys and girls have a swim race which the girls win easily. Then they have a softball game, which the boys lose with only one run. Other competitions are just as lopsided. Charlie and Shermy, disillusioned by their continued defeat, see Snoopy arm-wrestling with the boys. They realize that the boys might get even with an arm wrestling game, with \"The Masked Marvel\" (Snoopy) as their champion. Snoopy goes into training, eating the camp's awful food, doing exercises, and drinking a nutritious and noxious concoction. In the contest, Snoopy goes up against Lucy. They both get sweaty and tired in the match, which ends when Snoopy kisses Lucy. He pins her hand; but she says that kissing her was a foul, and she is the winner. Back at school, Charlie only comes up with 13 words on his essay that he and Linus are forced to write on the first day, having been caught playing hangman in class. Linus gets an A but Charlie gets a C-. Linus then says \"Oh, well, it was a short summer, Charlie Brown\", to which Charlie gloomily replies, \"And it looks like it's going to be a long winter\". ==Voice cast== * Peter Robbins as Charlie Brown * Pamelyn Ferdin as Lucy van Pelt * Glenn Gilger as Linus van Pelt * Hilary Momberger as Sally Brown * Ann Altieri as Frieda and Violet Gray * David Carey as Shermy * Christopher DeFaria as Peppermint Patty * Chris DeFaria as Pig-Pen * Sally Dryer as Clara, Shirley, and Sophie * Matthew Liftin as Roy * Lisa DeFaria as Patty * John Daschback as Schroeder * Bill Melendez as Snoopy ==Credits== * Created and Written by: Charles M.
