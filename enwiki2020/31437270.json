Lee, The Canada Company and the Huron Tract, 1826-1853.Toronto: Natural Heritage Books, 2004.p.149 His moderate approach and financial innovations for the Canada Company would give him good standing with the pioneers of the Huron Tract and the reformers of Upper Canada. Widder's administrative talents and dedication to hard work allowed him to overshadow Thomas Mercer Jones and take the lead in the Canada Company. Widder's home, Lyndhurst, became a social hub of Toronto. Widder's wife, Elizabeth, entertained in style providing upper- class residents of York with refined entertainments redolent of British aristocratic and middle-class life.Kristina Marie Guiguet, The ideal world of Mrs Widder's soir\u00e9e musicale: social identity and musical life in nineteenth- century Ontario., Ottawa: Canadian Museum of Civilization, 2004. ==Bibliography== * * * * * ==References== Category:People from Toronto Category:People of pre-Confederation Canada Category:1801 births Category:1865 deaths ",
