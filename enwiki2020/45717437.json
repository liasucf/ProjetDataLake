He is sapped juggling between managing his career and raising four children, Huixin (Julie Tan), Haowei (Ian Fang), Haolian (Aloysius Pang), and Huiyan (Bonnie Loo), who differ markedly in character. Much as Chen Kai would like to be a good father, he is drifting apart from his children. Xuemei does not mind that Chen Kai is a father of four. Neither is Chen Kai put off by Xuemei\u2019s self-deprecating remark that she is \u201cnot pretty, not gentle and not thoughtful\u201d. The two of them hit it off and decide to enter into a relationship with marriage in the cards. The four children resist Xuemei\u2019s intrusion into their lives and are determined to join hands to fend off \u201cthe invasion of Tiger Mum\u201d. In the end, will Xuemei the \u201cTigress\u201d win the children\u2019s hearts?
