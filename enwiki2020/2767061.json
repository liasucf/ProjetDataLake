    "text": "Wilczek in 2020 Zbigniew Marian Wilczek, also known as Ziggy the Umbrella Man, is a homeless man in the inner Brisbane suburb of Toowong. Ziggy objects to being labelled as \"homeless\" as he chose his situation and does not ask for food, money or clothing and enjoys living in a public park. Ziggy gained press coverage in 2004, becoming a controversial issue in two consecutive local elections. Ziggy is well-known for tourists giving him ice cream. His favourite flavour is vanilla. ==Biography== Despite the lack of information pertaining to his early life it is known that Zbigniew the umbrella man was born as Zbigniew Marian Wilczek in the early 1950s and was of a Polish nationality. His name was later changed to Tim Jenkins. While it is unknown when exactly he became homeless, he had been sighted in Jephson Street Toowong as early as 1989. He became known by the locals as either \"Tim\" or \"Zbigniew\". \"Zbigniew the umbrella man\" became his nickname throughout his ongoing media coverage. He entered public view in the year 2000 with the then Lord Mayor Jim Soorley protesting the complaints of several Toowong businesses requesting that he be removed on the grounds that he was bad for business and his low levels of hygiene attracted rats. Soorley claimed that he was completely within the law in his position. As he gained attention, he was in increased danger, with his small home being attacked several times by various groups demanding his removal from Toowong. His publicity only grew and since then has featured in local news reports several times. Early in 2004 he was the subject of \"Operation Zbigniew\", an effort by ABC presenter (from 612 AM) Spencer Howson to find him a home. After being interviewed on air, it was revealed that Zbigniew was not so willing to be a party to this scheme and so the plan collapsed. Later that year a portrait of him painted by local artist Bruce Chapman was entered in the Archibald Prize. His only requested payment was $8 worth of food, including ice cream, several biscuits and a bottle of soft drink. Zbigniew also gave an interview for a similar fee of $10.Interview with Zbigniew During July 2004, he is said to have had his first shower and his home became too messy by his own self-imposed rules; the police were called in to help clean up and Zbigniew promised to move by Christmas. He found a new spot in a local barbecue area, remaining in Toowong. After more attacks on him midway through 2005, new calls were made to have him taken off the streets, Lord Mayor Campbell Newman insists, just as his predecessor did, that Zbigniew is breaking no laws and will not be forced to move, despite Newman's personal hopes that he could be moved to a \"proper place\". In December 2005 his possessions were confiscated by police due to smell and vermin. In July 2006 Zbigniew moved on from his High Street location to a new spot at Oakman Park. Radio News reported that he moved because of attacks at his old location. He later moved to Toowong Creek. Zbigniew has most recently moved to a Taringa park between Morrow Street and Moggil Road. ==References== Category:1950s births Category:Living people Category:Australian people of Polish descent Category:Homeless people Category:People from Brisbane Category:Homelessness in Australia ",
