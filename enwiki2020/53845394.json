Their television debut was on MTV in 2007, when they co-starred in The Countdown to Newport Harbor: The Real Orange County, a segment filmed and produced by MTV Studios. While shooting the video for MTV in New York, the sisters also starred in Clean & Clear's Morning Burst Shine Control Cleanser campaign, and appeared on Demanded, an On-Demand original program from Music Choice, co-hosted by a different chart-topping music artist every episode. Their credits have gone on to include work with Summit Entertainment, IFC, LAIKA, Nike, SanDisk, and others. In March 2015 Jen and Kat's first music single, Better Place, was released worldwide, and in November 2015 their four-song electropop EP entitled Here and Now followed suit. In 2016, Jen and Kat won the Best Music category in the Armstrong Vine Awards, hosted at Mashable headquarters. In November 2017, Jen and Kat released their debut album, The Sound of Goodbye, making a return to their acoustic pop roots, a style first heard in their 2015 single Better Place. In the fall of 2018, Jen and Kat announced they would be releasing a new single monthly, starting October 2018 and running throughout the following year.
