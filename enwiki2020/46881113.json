    "text": "\"Hush Boy\" is a song by English electronic music duo Basement Jaxx. It was released in 2006 by record label XL as the first single from their fourth studio album Crazy Itch Radio. It reached number 27 in the UK Singles Chart. ==Composition== With the song \"Oh My Gosh\", the duo sat down and wrote it specially as a single for the album. Ratcliffe personally felt encouraged by it, he thought it was a good way to ease them back into songwriting process and applied the treatment to make \"Hush Boy\". However, they failed, and made the process even more difficult.. FaceCulture. August 4, 2006.
