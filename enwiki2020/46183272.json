In addition to publishing a book, she has a blog and has written for The American Spectator, Commonweal, National Catholic Register, National Review, and The Washington Blade. , she lives in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, DC. Tushnet came out as a lesbian around the age of 13 or 14, and her family was supportive. She entered Yale University in 1996 as \"a happy lesbian.\" Raised in a \"secular Jewish\" household, she converted to Catholicism in 1998 at the age of 19 during her sophomore year. Her father is Mark Tushnet and her mother is Elizabeth Alexander, who directs the National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union. Her sister Rebecca Tushnet is a professor of law at Harvard Law School. Tushnet is celibate due to the Catholic Church's ban on sex outside heterosexual marriage. She does not support same-sex marriage, having stated that marriage should be reserved for heterosexuals, whose \"relationships can be either uniquely dangerous or uniquely fruitful. Thus it makes sense to have an institution dedicated to structuring and channeling them.\" \"I really think the most important thing is, I really like being gay and I really like being Catholic,\" she says. \"If nobody ever calls me self-hating again, it will be too soon.\" ==Bibliography== * * \"A Story Like Mine\", Lady Churchill's Rosebud Wristlet #24 (2009) * Amends: A Novel (2015) ==References== ==External links== * Eve Tushnet's blog Category:American Roman Catholics Category:American Roman Catholic religious writers Category:Lesbian writers Category:LGBT writers from the United States Category:Living people Category:1978 births Category:American bloggers Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:LGBT Roman Catholics Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Judaism Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:American women bloggers Category:Catholics from Washington, D.C.
