    "text": "Quintus Marcius Rex was a member of the Marcii Reges, the family founded by the Roman King Ancus Marcius. His father Quintus Marcius Rex, the praetor in 144 BC, built the Aqua Marcia aqueduct, the longest aqueduct of ancient Rome. The aqueduct was known for its water purity and its cold temperature. Marcius carried on a war against the Stoeni, a Ligurian people at the foot of the Alps, and obtained a triumph in the following year on account of his victories over them. During his consulship in 118 BC, Marcius lost his only son, a youth of great promise, but had such mastery over his feelings as to meet the senate on the day of his son's burial, and perform his regular official duties. His sister Marcia married Gaius Julius Caesar II. They had a son, Sextus Julius Caesar (the consul in 91 BC, a politician and supporter of Gaius Marius); a daughter, Julia, wife of Gaius Marius and another son Gaius Julius Caesar III, a praetor who would marry Aurelia Cotta and would become parents to Julius Caesar the dictator. Through his son, possibly named Quintus Marcius Rex due to Roman naming conventions, he had a grandson also named Quintus Marcius Rex, who was the consul in 68 BC. ==References== Category:Roman Republican consuls Category:Senators of the Roman Republic Category:2nd-century BC Romans Quintus ",
