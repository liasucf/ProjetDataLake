    "text": "Sharon Que (Querciagrossa) (born May 18, 1960 in Detroit, Michigan) is an American visual artist and luthier, based in Ann Arbor, specializing in violin restoration and repair. It has been said that much of Que\u2019s imagery can be perceived as multilayers, with some forms suggesting a mix of spiritual, secular, and mathematical or even industrial significance. Some of her sculptures are also owned by important American institutions and are in public spaces, including the Detroit Institute of Arts. Being deeply involved with Music, in March 2007 she has been a curator of the exhibit \"Instrumental\", at the Ann Arbor Gallery Project, featuring diversely talented artists who are creatively engaged in industrial design, engineering, music, acoustics, math, violin and bow making. Sculpture: Constructed, March 24 to May 16, 2008, at Gallery One, Washtenaw Community College, Ann Arbor featured some of her works together with some of Tom Phardel, as done by Lemberg Gallery Summer Mix (Jul 12 - Aug 9, 2008), with her Survival Engine. == Solo exhibitions == * 2005: Automatic Desires, Museo ItaloAmericano, Fort Mason Center, San Francisco, CA * 2003: Retrofit, Meadow Brook Art Gallery, Oakland University, Rochester, MI * 2003: Immersed, Byron Roche Gallery, Chicago, IL * 2001: Loop, Lemberg Gallery, Ferndale, MI * 1999: Concentric Chronology, Warren Robbins Gallery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI * 1999: Seamless Motion, G.R.
