    "text": "The City of Edinburgh Music School is a state-maintained music school in Scotland in Edinburgh, Scotland. Founded as the Lothian Specialist Music School in 1980, it changed its name in 1996 when Lothian Regional Council was dissolved into four separate unitary councils. It is a non-residential school, and because it is funded by the City of Edinburgh Council, it charges no fees. Unlike residential music schools, pupils attend comprehensive schools for their academic classes: Flora Stevenson Primary and Broughton High School. The school was the subject of BBC Scotland's EX:S documentary, The Music School, on 29 March 2005. ==Notable alumni== *Martyn Bennett, bagpiper *Helen Grime, composer *Tommy Smith (saxophonist) ==See also== * Music Schools in Scotland * List of music schools in the United Kingdom ==References== ==External links== *Official site Category:Primary schools in Edinburgh Category:Secondary schools in Edinburgh Category:Culture in Edinburgh Category:1980 establishments in Scotland Category:Educational institutions established in 1980 Category:Music schools in Scotland ",
