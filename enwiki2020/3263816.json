    "text": "The English Opera Group was a small company of British musicians formed in 1947 by the composer Benjamin Britten (along with John Piper, Eric Crozier and Anne Wood) for the purpose of presenting his and other, primarily British, composers' operatic works. The group later expanded to present larger-scale works, and was renamed the English Music Theatre Company. The organisation produced its last opera and ceased to run in 1980. ==English Opera Group== Fleeing internal politics at Sadler's Wells Opera at the end of 1945, Britten and singers Joan Cross, Anne Wood, and Peter Pears joined with designer Piper and producer Crozier to found the English Opera Group.Gilbert, p. 107 The new company's goal was to premi\u00e8re Britten's operas, and to present other, mostly British, small-scale operas.Rosenthal, Harold. English Opera Group in Sadie, vol. 2, p. 52 The company's first project was to premi\u00e8re Britten's chamber opera Albert Herring and give further performances of his opera The Rape of Lucretia during a tour of British and continental European venues. It also commissioned and premi\u00e8red a new piece by Lennox Berkeley, a setting of the Stabat Mater. Despite heavy subsidies, however, the costs of touring could not be recouped, so Britten and the group's other directors decided that it should be based at a home venue. This was the prime reason for the inauguration of the Aldeburgh Festival in 1948.Britten-Pears Foundation. The English Opera Group and English Music Theatre Company archive. Accessed 9 June 2011 The first opera commissioned by the group, Brian Easdale's The Sleeping Children, was premi\u00e8red in 1951. It gave the North American premi\u00e8re of Britten's The Turn of the Screw at Canada's Stratford Festival in 1957.J. Alan B. Somerset. 1991. The Stratford Festival Story, 1st edition. Greenwood Press. Aside from other new works by Britten, the group commissioned and produced eleven other new operas by British composers. It also gave the British premi\u00e8re of Francis Poulenc's opera Les mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias in 1958. The group also performed older operas, such as Acis and Galatea, The Beggar's Opera, Idomeneo, Iolanta, La rondine and Trial by Jury, and works by Henry Purcell and Gustav Holst. The Royal Opera, London took over management of the group in 1961. In 1971 Steuart Bedford was appointed musical director, and Colin Graham became director of productions. ==English Music Theatre Company== In 1975 the group was enlarged to be able to produce works such as operettas and musicals in addition to opera. As well as appearing at festivals such as Aldeburgh, the company undertook regional tours and yearly performance seasons at the Sadler's Wells Theatre in London. The founder and leader of the company was Colin Graham. One of their 1976 productions was The Threepenny Opera by Kurt Weill, conducted by the young Simon Rattle.In the same season the company also presented Paul Bunyan, The Turn of the Screw, Cinderella and La finta giardiniera (under the title of Sandrina's Secret), all conducted by Steuart Bedford. See \"London Diary for October\", The Musical Times, September 1976, p. 792. . After a final production of Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1980, the company was disbanded. == Operas premiered (not including Britten's) == {| | Year | Opera || Composer |- | 1951 | The Sleeping Children | Brian Easdale |- | 1954 | A Dinner Engagement || Lennox Berkeley |- | 1956 | Ruth || Lennox Berkeley |- | 1964 | English Eccentrics || Malcolm Williamson |- | 1967 | The Bear || William Walton |- | | Castaway || Lennox Berkeley |} {| | Year | Opera || Composer |- | 1968 | Punch and Judy || Harrison Birtwistle |- | 1969 | Purgatory || Gordon Crosse (written 1966) |- | | The Grace of Todd || Gordon Crosse |- | 1972 | The Visitors || John Gardner |- | 1974 | The Voice of Ariadne | Thea Musgrave |} ===English Music Theatre Company=== {| | Year | Opera || Composer |- | 1976 | Tom Jones || Stephen Oliver |- | 1978 | La Cubana || Hans Werner Henze (written 1973) |- | | Transformations || Conrad Susa |- | 1979 | An Actor's Revenge | Minoru Miki |} == Prominent former members == * Janet Baker * James Bowman * Owen Brannigan * Joan Cross * Eric Crozier * Nancy Evans * Kathleen Ferrier * Sylvia Fisher * Colin Graham * Heather Harper * Della Jones * Thomas Lawlor * Norman Lumsden * Benjamin Luxon * Peter Pears * Anthony Rolfe Johnson * John Shirley-Quirk * Robert Tear * Jennifer Vyvyan * Olive Zorian ==References== Notes Sources * *Matthews, David (2003).
