    "text": "Walk, Don't Run is a 1966 American comedy film directed by Charles Walters, and starring Cary Grant in his final film role, Samantha Eggar and Jim Hutton. The film is a remake of the 1943 film The More the Merrier and is set during the Olympic Games. ==Plot== In 1964 Tokyo, Sir William Rutland (Cary Grant) is an important British businessman, who arrives two days early and is greeted by the housing shortage caused by the 1964 Summer Olympics. While at the British Embassy seeking help, he notices an announcement of an available apartment and decides to check the place out. He finds himself at the residence of Christine Easton, who insists that it would be improper to take him in as a housemate; she had forgotten to advertise that she would prefer to rent to a woman. Easton eventually lets Rutland stay\u2014half because she is persuaded it is her patriotic duty to take him in and half because of Rutland's own self-assured pushiness. Rutland sublets half of his cramped space to American Olympic competitor Steve Davis. While Easton is less than thrilled with the arrangement, she has to put up with it, as she has already spent Rutland's share of the rent. Rutland sets about playing matchmaker for the two young people, in spite of their disparate personalities and Easton\u2019s engagement to a boringly dependable British diplomat, Julius P. Haversack. Davis repeatedly refuses to reveal what sport he is competing in. Rutland meddles in the young couple's romantic troubles. To further his matchmaking, he even strips down to his boxer shorts and a T-shirt so he can pretend to be a competitor and talk to Davis during his event, the men's 50 kilometres walk, and try to heal the breach between the young lovers. ==Cast== * Cary Grant as Sir William Rutland * Samantha Eggar as Christine Easton * Jim Hutton as Steve Davis * John Standing as Julius P.
