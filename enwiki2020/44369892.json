Momin Ali Munshi of Galaxy Lollywood rated the film 2/5 stars and summed up his review as \"Halla Gulla terms itself as 'Pakistan's First Solid Entertainer' but do not let this fool you as it is anything but entertainment. The director has no idea what he is doing with the film and needs to take direction lessons. Except for the two leading actors there is nothing that works for the film and it would not be wrong to claim that this film is a disaster of epic proportions.\" Rashid Nazir Ali of Reviewit.pk verdict his review as \"Halla Gulla is a weak and unimpressive effort from Kamran Akbar Khan.\" ==See also== * List of Pakistani films of 2015 == References == == External links == * * * Category:Pakistani films Category:Lollywood films Category:Urdu-language films Category:Pakistani romantic comedy films Category:2015 films Category:2015 romantic comedy films Category:Films scored by Sahir Ali Bagga Category:2015 directorial debut films Category:2015 comedy films ",
