There was also another, more controversial new rule for points: if a match was drawn, two points would be given to the winner of a penalty shootout, and one point to the loser of the shootout. This rule, suggested by Tom A. Schanke and appointed by the Norwegian Football Association in February 1987, was highly controversial and liquidated after the 1987 season. Note that if draws would end as draws with one point to each, as usual, Troms\u00f8 IL would have been placed 10th with a possibility of being relegated. Moss FK, coached by Nils Arne Eggen, won the league for the first and, as of the 2019 season, last time. The victory was not settled until the final round of the league, with Moss beating runners-up Molde FK (who would have grabbed the gold if they defeated Moss) 2-0 at away grounds. ====2. divisjon==== =====Group A===== =====Group B===== ====3. divisjon==== ===Norwegian Cup=== ====Final==== ==Women's football== ===League season=== ====1. divisjon==== Source: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" ! |Pos ! |Team ! |P ! |W ! |D ! |L ! |F ! |A ! |GD ! |Pts |- align=\"right |1||align=\"left\"|Klepp ||18 || 11 ||3-0|| 4 || 44||23|| +21 ||39 |- align=\"right |2||align=\"left\"|Sprint/Jel\u00f8y ||18 || 10 ||2-2|| 4 || 42||16|| +26 ||36 |- align=\"right |3||align=\"left\"|Asker ||18 || 8 ||3-2|| 5 || 38||32|| +6 ||32 |- align=\"right |4||align=\"left\"|Sandviken ||18 || 9 ||2-0|| 7 || 34||24|| +10 ||31 |- align=\"right |5||align=\"left\"|B\u00f8ler ||18 || 8 ||2-2|| 6 || 30||22|| +8 ||30 |- align=\"right |6||align=\"left\"|Trondheims-\u00d8rn ||18 || 8 ||2-2|| 6 || 17||20|| -3 ||30 |- align=\"right |7||align=\"left\"|Setskog ||18 || 7 ||0-4|| 7 || 25||35|| -10 ||25 |- align=\"right |8||align=\"left\"|BUL ||18 || 6 ||1-1|| 10 || 24||29|| -5 ||21 |- style=\"background:#FF6666;\" align=\"center\" |9||align=\"left\"|Troll ||18 || 2 ||2-3|| 11 || 17||33|| -16 ||13 |- style=\"background:#FF6666;\" align=\"center\" |10||align=\"left\"|Grand ||18 || 4 ||0-1|| 13 || 17||54|| -37 ||13 |} {| bgcolor=\"#f7f8ff\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\" |- | style=\"background: #FF6666\" width=\"20\" | | bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" align=\"left\" | Relegated to the Second Division |} ===Norwegian Women's Cup=== ====Final==== *Sprint/Jel\u00f8y 2\u20131 Klepp ==UEFA competitions== ===European Cup=== ====First round==== |} ====Second round==== |} ===European Cup Winners' Cup=== ====First round==== |} ===UEFA Cup=== ====First round==== |} ==National teams== ===Norway men's national football team=== ====Results==== Source: ===Norway women's national football team=== ====Results==== ==References== ==External links== * Norge Menn Senior A, Football Association of Norway 1908\u2013present * RSSSF.no \u2013 National team 1987 Category:Seasons in Norwegian football ",
