    "text": "Francisco 'Paco' Bienzobas Oc\u00e1riz (26 March 1909 \u2013 30 April 1981) was a Spanish footballer who played as a forward. Having spent most of his 16-year career with Real Sociedad \u2013 196 official games and 109 goals \u2013 he was the first player to win the Pichichi Trophy award, given to the top scorer in La Liga. ==Club career== Born in San Sebasti\u00e1n, Gipuzkoa, Bienzobas arrived at local Real Sociedad at the age of 17 from amateurs Uni\u00f3n Deportiva de San Sebasti\u00e1n, helping the Basques win the regional championship in his first year. He reached his first Copa del Rey final with the former in 1928, facing FC Barcelona in three games (two 1\u20131 draws and a 1\u20133 loss). In 1929, a national league was created and Real Sociedad participated in La Liga's first edition, finishing fourth out of the ten teams competing. Bienzobas scored 17 goals during the season, being the first player to be crowned Pichichi; he spent a further four years with the club. In 1934, Bienzobas joined CA Osasuna, at the time in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n, helping the Navarrese club immediately achieve promotion, only to be being relegated back the next season. The Spanish Civil War put a stop to his career for three years and subsequently he returned to Real Sociedad in 1940, retiring from football at the end of 1941\u201342 (aged 33) after making only five appearances during the campaign. He amassed Spanish top division totals of 92 games and 50 goals, and overall totals of 196 games and 109 goals for Real Sociedad. He was a penalty specialist, failing to convert only one of 75 spot kicks in his career. ==International career== Bienzobas appeared for Spain on two occasions, scoring as many goals. His debut came on 4 June 1928, as the national team lost 1\u20137 against Italy in the Summer Olympics. ==Coaching and refereeing== After his retirement, Bienzobas worked briefly as a manager with Osasuna. In 1942 he began a referee in a spell that would eventually feature him in 48 Spanish top flight games, his debut coming in 1948. ==Personal life== Paco Bienzobas had two brothers who were also footballers: the older Custodio, a forward, was a teammate at Real Sociedad for two seasons; the younger Anastasio (Cuqui), a midfielder, also started his career at the Txuriurdin club but became established at Osasuna where he was joined by Paco, and after the Spanish Civil War was a regular in the team at Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a for most of the 1940s. He died in 30 April 1981, a day after being informed that Real Sociedad had finally won La Liga for the first time. ==References== ==External links== * * *Spain stats at Eu-Football * Category:1909 births Category:1981 deaths Category:Sportspeople from San Sebasti\u00e1n Category:Spanish footballers Category:Basque footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:La Liga players Category:Real Sociedad footballers Category:CA Osasuna players Category:Spain international footballers Category:Olympic footballers of Spain Category:Footballers at the 1928 Summer Olympics Category:Spanish football managers Category:CA Osasuna managers Category:Pichichi Trophy winners Category:Spanish football referees Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Basque Country international footballers ",
