    "text": "Debbie Ngarewa-Packer is a New Zealand politician who is the co-leader of the M\u0101ori Party and the leader and chief executive of the Ng\u0101ti Ruanui iwi. == Early life == Ngarewa-Packer grew up in P\u0101tea and attended New Plymouth Girls' High School. == Local government == Ngarewa-Packer is a former deputy mayor of South Taranaki. She was first elected to the South Taranaki District Council in the 2007 local elections, representing the P\u0101tea ward, having also unsuccessfully contested the mayoralty. However, new mayor Ross Dunlop named her as his deputy mayor. She held that role until 2010, when she did not seek re-election and was replaced by Alex Ballantyne. == M\u0101ori Party == Ngarewa- Packer was elected co-leader of the M\u0101ori Party in April 2020, along with John Tamihere. Both ran uncontested. She had previously been selected to be the M\u0101ori Party's candidate for the Te Tai Hau\u0101uru electorate for the 2020 election in October 2019, and was the first electoral candidate announced by the party for that election. Ngarewa-Packer and Tamihere are the first party leaders elected since the M\u0101ori Party lost its parliament seats in the 2017 election, after which its previous leaders stepped down. Ngarewa-Packer has the party's number one list position for the 2020 election. Ngarewa-Packer was generally considered to be the M\u0101ori Party's best chance at returning to Parliament; with polls showing the party below the 5 percent threshold, it would need to win at least one electorate seat to enter. However, a poll released in late September 2020 showed that Labour's candidate for Te Tai Hau\u0101uru, Adrian Rurawhe, as having greater support than Ngarewa-Packer, though there was a large number of undecided voters in the poll. In response to the poll, Ngarewa-Packer said she was buoyed by the number of undecided voters and called the electorate \u201cwinnable\u201d. At the 2020 election, she was unable to unseat Rurawhe as MP for Te Tai Hau\u0101uru, coming close but falling short of Rurawhe's 9,431 votes by a margin of 1,121https://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electorate-details-69.html. Although she did not win Te Tai Hau\u0101uru, her fellow Maori party candidate Rawiri Waititi successfully unseated Labour MP Tamati Coffey in the Waiariki Maori electorate, allowing the party to enter parliament. Although as of preliminary results Waititi remains the Maori party's only MP, if the party is able to raise their party vote by approximately 0.2 percent once special votes are counted, she will enter parliament as a List MP due to her placement on the Maori Party list, giving the party a caucus of two MPs. Since John Tamihere did not enter parliament, Waititi replaced him, joining Ngarewa-Packer as co- leader of the party. == Ng\u0101ti Ruanui and local activism == Ngarewa-Packer is chief executive of the Ng\u0101ti Ruanui iwi. She is also kaiarataki of Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101ti Ruanui, which runs healthcare centres in H\u0101wera and P\u0101tea. Ngarewa- Packer has been advocating for M\u0101ori health and the environment at a grassroots level for many years. She has campaigned against iron sands mining off the Taranaki coast. In April 2020, the Court of Appeal found that the Environmental Protection Authority's decision in 2017 to grant a marine discharge consent to a mining company was not consistent with the law to protect the environment from harmful substances. However, the company behind the plan is seeking leave from the Supreme Court to appeal. On the appeal, Ngarewa-Packer said \"We\u2019re annoyed that we may have to go to court for a fourth time as right now our efforts are focused on protecting our community from Covid-19. But we are undeterred in our resolve and we will oppose TTR\u2019s application for yet another appeal.\" In 2004, she rallied more than 250 Taranaki people to join with the foreshore and seabed hikoi on its way to Wellington. In 2011, she joined a 10-member independent panel set up by the Government to identify ways to raise the rate of return on Maori-owned assets, and grow Maori contribution to New Zealand's economy. Regarding the Covid-19 response, The Spinoff described Ngarewa-Packer as \"a key voice in the Covid-19 iwi response, not only in analysing and mitigating risks in her own rohe, but in keeping applied pressure on local and central government to include M\u0101ori in their risk assessment.\" == Personal == Ngarewa-Packer is of Ng\u0101ti Ruahine, Ng\u0101ruahine, and Ng\u0101 Rauru iwi. She is a descendant of Tutange Waionui of Ngati Ruanui, who fought alongside Titokowaru during the New Zealand Land Wars and claimed credit for killing Austrian mercenary Gustavus von Tempsky. Ngarewa- Packer was a nominee for the Taranaki Daily News person of the year in 2018. == References == Category:Living people Category:M\u0101ori Party politicians Category:Deputy mayors of places in New Zealand Category:Leaders of political parties in New Zealand Category:New Zealand activists Category:New Zealand women activists Category:Ng\u0101ti Ruanui Category:New Zealand M\u0101ori women Category:21st-century New Zealand politicians Category:21st-century New Zealand women politicians Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:Candidates in the 2020 New Zealand general election ",
