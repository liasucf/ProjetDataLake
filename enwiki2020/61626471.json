Originally planning to spend 50 episodes on each film, producer Ben Hosley convinced the hosts to only do ten. Having used a lengthy analysis of a filmography as a means of discussing the films' director, Newman and Sims decided to use a similar approach in reviewing the works of other directors. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align: center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"padding: 0 8px;\" | ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"padding: 0 8px;\" | Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"padding: 0 8px;\" | Title reference ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"padding: 0 8px;\" | Director ! colspan=\"3\" | Initial Release |- !
