The college has 4,500 students in credit/apprentice/collaborative programs, and 5,000 continuing education students that attend the Grande Prairie and Fairview campuses annually. The college offers a number of apprenticeship and academic programs including certificates and diplomas, university studies, academic upgrading, and workforce development courses in various subjects.

In 1970, the college was renamed to its current title. In 1974, classes were first started in a new facility designed by Canadian architect Douglas Cardinal. In 1991, phase two of the college, designed by architects Field, Field, and Field, was officially opened. In recognition of the Aboriginal heritage of the region, there are many monuments and displays which reflect this rich history from the surrounding communities. From 1995 to 2005, GPRC offered its own Bachelor of Applied Forest Resource Management degree. ==Academic programs== Collaborative programs with other institutions such as the University of Alberta allow students to complete some bachelor's degrees at GPRC, including the Bachelor of Science \u2013 Agriculture. Other degree programs require transferring to another institution to complete their degree after studying at the college. Some arrangements also allow for a student to start studies at another facility and complete their degree program at the college. In total, over 20 different routes for university studies are offered, and some degrees can be completed at the College. The college offers over 15 certificate and diploma programs. Certificate programs usually require students to complete two semesters of courses, while diploma programs usually require four. Academic upgrading is also offered, which allows individuals to pursue other learning opportunities such as Grade 12 equivalency and general studies. GPRC has an International Education Centre which offers students courses in English as a second language (ESL). Foreign students can also take credit-based college and university courses offered to Canadian residents. GPRC's Continuing Education (Workforce Development) offers courses to the general public in a number of areas. Courses primarily focus on personal and professional development, and range from one-day courses to full credit programs. GPRC's Fairview Campus offers the only authorized training centre in Canada for Harley-Davidson motorcycles. ==Athletics program== GPRC's sports teams are collectively known as the \"Wolves\" and compete in the Alberta Colleges Athletic Conference. The College's sports programs has men's and women's teams that compete in basketball, cross-country running, soccer, and volleyball. The Cross Country Running program is GPRC's most successful athletic program winning 3 CCAA individual gold medals and 2 individual silver medals.
