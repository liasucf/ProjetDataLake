    "text": "Qara H\u00fcleg\u00fc (died 1252) was head of the ulus of the Chagatai Khanate (1242 - 1246, 1252). He was the son of M\u00f6'et\u00fcken (killed during the 1221 siege of Bamiyan), and a grandson of Chagatai Khan. Qara H\u00fcleg\u00fc was nominated by Chagatai Khan, as well as \u00d6gedei Khan, to become khan. Since he was still young, Ebuskun acted as regent for him. In order to ensure his power, however, the Grand Khan G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan deposed him in 1246 and replaced him with one of Qara H\u00fcleg\u00fc's uncles, Yes\u00fc M\u00f6ngke. However, following the ascension of G\u00fcy\u00fck's successor, M\u00f6ngke Khan, Qara H\u00fcleg\u00fc gained the Great Khan's favor by supporting him in his purges of the family of \u00d6gedei Khan. He was restored to his position of Chagatai Khan, but died before returning to his realm. Mongke permitted his wife Orghana Khatun to serve as regent. Qara H\u00fcleg\u00fc was later succeeded by his son Mubarak Shah. Category:1252 deaths Category:Chagatai khans Category:13th-century monarchs in Asia Category:Year of birth unknown ",
