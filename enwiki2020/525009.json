    "text": "An aptitude is a component of a competence to do a certain kind of work at a certain level. Outstanding aptitude can be considered \"talent.\" An aptitude may be physical or mental. Aptitude is inborn potential to do certain kinds of work whether developed or undeveloped. Ability is developed knowledge, understanding, learnt or acquired abilities (skills) or attitude. The innate nature of aptitude is in contrast to skills and achievement, which represent knowledge or ability that is gained through learning. According to Gladwell (2008) and Colvin (2008), often it is difficult to set apart an outstanding performance due merely to talent or stemming from hard training. Talented people as a rule show high results immediately in few kinds of activity,Multitalented Creative People but often only in a single direction or genre.Greatest Comedic ActorsFamous People in Dramatic Film == Intelligence and aptitude == Aptitude and intelligence quotient are differing but related views of human mental ability. Unlike the original idea of IQ, aptitude often refers to one of the many different characteristics which can be independent of each other, such as aptitude for military flight, air traffic control, or computer programming. This approach measures a variety of separate skills, similar to the theory of multiple intelligences and Cattell\u2013Horn\u2013Carroll theory and many other modern theories of intelligence. In general, aptitude tests are more likely to be designed and used for career and employment decisions, and intelligence tests are more likely to be used for educational and research purposes. However, there is a great deal of overlap between them, and they often measure the same kinds of abilities. For example, aptitude tests such as the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery measure enough aptitudes that they could also serve as a measure of general intelligence. A single construct such as mental ability is measured with multiple tests. Often, a person's group of test scores will be highly correlated with each other, which makes a single measure useful in many cases. For example, the U.S. Department of Labor's General Learning Ability is determined by combining Verbal, Numerical and Spatial aptitude scores. However, many individuals have skills that are a lot higher or lower than their overall mental ability level. Aptitude subtests are used intra-individually to determine which tasks that individual is more skilled at performing. This information can be useful for determining which job roles are the best fits for employees or applicants. Often, before more rigorous aptitude tests are used, individuals are screened for a basic level of aptitude through a previously-completed process, such as SAT scores, GRE scores, GATE scores, degrees, or other certifications. == Combined aptitude and knowledge tests == Tests that assess learned skills or knowledge are frequently called achievement tests. However, certain tests can assess both types of constructs. An example that leans both ways is the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), which is given to recruits entering the armed forces of the United States. Another is the SAT, which is designed as a test of aptitude for college in the United States, but has achievement elements. For example, it tests mathematical reasoning, which depends both on mathematical ability and education received in mathematics. Aptitude tests can typically be grouped according to the type of cognitive ability they measure: # Fluid intelligence: the ability to think and reason abstractly, effectively solve problems and think strategically. It is more commonly known as \u2018street smarts\u2019 or the ability to \u2018quickly think on your feet\u2019. An example of what employers can learn from one's fluid intelligence is one's suitability for the role for which one is applying. # Crystallised intelligence: the ability to learn from past experiences and to apply this learning to work-related situations. Work situations that require crystallised intelligence include producing and analysing written reports, comprehending work instructions, using numbers as a tool to make effective decisions, etc.The Too Many Aptitudes ProblemMultipotentiality: multiple talents, multiple challenges Personal Reflections on Testing == See also == *General Learning Ability *Skill *Spatial visualization ability *Learning disability == References == == Bibliography == * * Category:Skills Category:Educational psychology eu:Gaitasun pt:Habilidade ",
