    "text": "In mathematics, the Fr\u00f6licher spectral sequence (often misspelled as Fr\u00f6hlicher) is a tool in the theory of complex manifolds, for expressing the potential failure of the results of cohomology theory that are valid in general only for K\u00e4hler manifolds. It was introduced by . A spectral sequence is set up, the degeneration of which would give the results of Hodge theory and Dolbeault's theorem. ==See also== * Hodge\u2013de Rham spectral sequence ==References== * Category:Complex manifolds Category:Spectral sequences ",
