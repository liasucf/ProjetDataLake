    "text": "Via is the debut full-length album by Los Angeles-based metalcore band Volumes. It was initially released on September 27, 2011 through Mediaskare Records. The album is considered an important contributor to the djent sound, among other albums released in the same year, such as Vildhjarta's M\u00e5sstaden, TesseracT's One and Born of Osiris' The Discovery. The album was re-released in 2016 independently under the 91367 Records moniker, remastered and with a new cover. However, the album's fifth track, Serenity, originally contained a solo towards the end of the song, but it was removed from the remastered edition of the album, likely due to copyright issues relating to Chris Letchford of Scale the Summit performing the solo on the album's original edition. ==Track listing== ==Credits== ;Volumes * Gus Farias - lead vocals * Michael Barr - lead vocals, drums * Diego Farias \u2013 lead guitar * Daniel Schwartz \u2013 rhythm guitar, clean vocals, keyboards * Raad Soudani \u2013 bass ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" !
