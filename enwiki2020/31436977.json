    "text": "Belladonna is a 2005 studio album by the Canadian singer-songwriter and producer Daniel Lanois who, according to his website, took the techniques he developed with Brian Eno and went on to produce career albums for Bob Dylan, Peter Gabriel, and Emmylou Harris. This journey comes full circle on Belladonna, an instrumental record that captures the often tense emotional dynamics of Eno's pioneering releases. Dense textures evolve into delicate Mexican melodies, capturing the disquieting serenity of American southwest landscapes. This is Lanois' self-proclaimed defining moment. One track on the album, \"The Deadly Nightshade\", had earlier been released on a 1996 album by Geoffrey Oryema as \"LPJ Christine\", although the version on Belladonna is without Oryema's vocals. ==Track listing== # \"Two Worlds\" - 2:03 # \"Sketches\" - 4:24 # \"Oaxaca\" - 2:50 # \"Agave\" - 1:59 # \"Telco\" - 3:34 # \"Desert Rose\" - 1:52 # \"Carla\" - 2:02 # \"The Deadly Nightshade\" - 4:06 # \"Dusty\" - 1:39 # \"Frozen\" - 3:17 # \"Panorama\" - 3:01 # \"Flametop Green\" - 2:27 # \"Todos Santos\" - 5:32 ==Personnel== * Daniel Lanois - pedal steel guitar * Malcolm Burn - keyboards, guitar * Aaron Embry - piano, guitar * Brad Mehldau - piano * Bill Dillon - guitar * Daryl Johnson - bass * Brian Blade - drums * Victor Indrizzo - drums * Gilbert Castellanos - trumpet * Michael Dessen - trombone * Adam Samuels - audio mixer ==References== Category:2005 albums Category:Daniel Lanois albums Category:Albums produced by Daniel Lanois Category:Anti- (record label) albums Category:Juno Award for Instrumental Album of the Year albums ",
