It was proposed under the second government of Michel Rocard (Parti socialiste) six months after the 1988 French legislative election. It was the first French law that put clinical trials on a firm legal footing. == First statute == An appendix, IIb, to the French civil code on Public Health, established the Comit\u00e9 consultatif de protection des personnes dans la recherche biom\u00e9dicale (CCPPRB), later succeeded by the Comit\u00e9s de protection des personnes (CPP). Its ambit, defined in Article 15, established in law the notion of a (a \"Clear consent\", perhaps similar to the Clean hands doctrine in common law), and established penalties for breaking the law. The common name , and abbreviated variations such as and , come from the names of the nominator and seconder in the French senate, Claude Huriet (Centrist) and Franck S\u00e9rusclat (Socialist). ==Evolution== As cases came to court with the usual jurisprudence,A French judge has far more investigative powers than those in Common law jurisdictions. public perception of the importance of bioethics and other European Union law, have supplemented the powers made under the original regulatory framework, such as (\"Law of 29 July 1994, Respect of the human body\"), which defined the legal notion of dignity, and (\"Law of 4 March 2002, Patient rights and the quality of health system\"). ==Notes== ==References== * Category:Bioethics Category:Health law in France ",
