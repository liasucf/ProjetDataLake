    "text": "The Dulce River (in Spanish R\u00edo Dulce, in Quechua Misky Mayu) is the most important river in the Argentine province of Santiago del Estero. The Dulce River's source is in Tucum\u00e1n Province under the name of Sal\u00ed River, though it receives tributaries from Salta Province, and changes names when reaching Santiago del Estero. It runs southeast throughout the province, and then feeds the R\u00edo Hondo in C\u00f3rdoba Province before emptying into the Mar Chiquita salt lake. There is also a dam in the limit with Tucum\u00e1n Province called R\u00edo Hondo dam, with a lake formatted with the connection of four rivers of Tucum\u00e1n. This lake is experiencing pollution due to the lack of control of the emissions of polluting substances into the Sal\u00ed River, caused mainly by the pulpmills located in Tucum\u00e1n. The river runs through the Argentine Espinal ecoregion. It is the main source of water for irrigation for the arid lands of Santiago del Estero. The Los Quiroga Dam in the northwest, finished in 1956, provides water for that area, but has produced a decrease in the precipitations of the southeastern part of the province. == References == Category:Rivers of Argentina Category:Rivers of Santiago del Estero Province Category:Ramsar sites in Argentina ",
