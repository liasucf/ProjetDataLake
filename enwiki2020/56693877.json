    "text": "ma-con is a German motor racing team. It was founded in 2001 by Marian Hamprecht. The team started racing in the Formula Renault 2000 Eurocup and Formula Renault 2000 Germany in 2002. Currently the team competes in the FIA Formula 3 European Championship. The team always focussed on regional and continental championships in Germany and Europe. Over time, the team entered using different names, namely ma-con Motorsport, ma-con Racing and ma-con Engineering alongside the common ma-con name. For the 2011 ADAC Formel Masters season the team run a second entry named Krafft Walzen. ==History== Founded in 2001 by successful German F3 team manager Marian Hamprecht, the team run in multiple Formula 1 feeder series and gained multiple success in the lower categories of open-wheel racing. After an early campaign in the 2002 and 2003 Formula Renault 2000 Eurocup seasons, the team bought out the Den Bl\u00e5 Avis outfit and thus appeared on the grid of the 2004 FIA F3000 Championship. Despite finishing third in the team's standings in their rookie season and pushing series veteran Tom\u00e1\u0161 Enge to fourth in the driver's championship, the team discontinued their entry and rather supported Enge's 2005 IRL entry, while joining the Italian F3000 grid with an all-Czech team. Despite even more success in the Italian F3000, the team took a break from racing after 2005. In 2008 the team joined the ADAC Formel Masters to built up a junior team spanning different tiers of feeder series, leading into the graduation of Andr\u00e9 Rudersdorf and Sven M\u00fcller within their team onto higher levels of open- wheel racing. In order to re-gain momentum of their 2012 FIA Formula 3 European Championship campaign the team closed down their ADAC Formel Masters operation despite one driver's and one team's title. The team signed British drivers Emil Bernstorff and Tom Blomqvist. Blomqvist had two podiums, while Bernstorff had only one. The team finished fourth in the teams' championship of 2012 Formula 3 Euro Series. The team also participated with Rudersdorf in Austrian Formula 3 Cup and in the Trophy Class of the German Formula Three Championship. He won both titles. This, however, didn't bring the success the team hoped for and stopped operating after the 2013 season. The team operated Christopher H\u00f6her's car in the Most round of the 2015 Remus F3 Cup in order to test Oreca F3 engine in the race conditions. He took one podium, but it was the only weekend for the ma-con crew, as in the Brno round H\u00f6her returned to Franz W\u00f6ss Racing's Dallara F308 Opel-Spiess. In 2018 ma-con made the announcement to re-join FIA Formula 3 European Championship with German driver Julian Hanses after four-year break. ==Current series results== ===FIA European Formula 3 Championship=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%\" |- !colspan=\"10\" align=\"center\"| FIA Formula 3 European Championship |- !
