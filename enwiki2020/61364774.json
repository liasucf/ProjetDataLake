    "text": "The Owl is the sixth studio album by American country music band Zac Brown Band. It was released on September 20, 2019, through Wheelhouse Records. ==Content== It is described as the band's \"most personal album to date\". For this album the band worked with pop and EDM writer and producers such as Poo Bear, Shawn Mendes, Max Martin, Benny Blanco, Ryan Tedder, and Skrillex. One of the tracks features a collaboration with Brandi Carlile. ==Critical reception== Kelly Dearmore of the blog Sounds Like Nashville gave a largely negative review, criticizing the lack of country sound relative to the band's preceding albums and comparing many songs negatively to Brown's electronica side project Sir Rosevelt. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic rated the album 2.5 out of 5 stars, also noting parallels to the Sir Rosevelt album. He concluded his review with \"The fact that a good chunk of the numbers work does not erase how deeply strange this album is.\" It also got a negative review from Pip Ellwood-Hughes of Entertainment Focus, who stated that \"Zac Brown Band have shown what they can do in the past and this set of songs doesn't come close. If this were the debut album of a new pop band, it may be received kindlier but this is a misjudged project from a beloved Country band that attempts to push boundaries but will likely just turn their fans off.\" ==Commercial performance== The Owl debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 with 106,000 album-equivalent units, including 99,000 pure album sales. It is Zac Brown Band's sixth US top 10 album. The album has sold 137,100 copies in the United States as of March 2020. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Zac Brown Band *Zac Brown \u2013 lead vocals, acoustic and electric guitars *Coy Bowles \u2013 electric guitar, electric slide guitar, Hammond organ *Clay Cook \u2013 background vocals, clavinet, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, electric slide guitar, Fender Rhodes, Hammond organ, Mellotron, pedal steel guitar, piano, tambourine, Wurlitzer *Daniel de los Reyes \u2013 percussion *Jimmy De Martini \u2013 acoustic guitar, background vocals, banjo, cello, electric guitar, violin *Chris Fryar \u2013 drums *John Driskell Hopkins \u2013 background vocals, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, banjo *Matt Mangano \u2013 acoustic and electric bass guitars, Moog bass, acoustic guitar Additional musicians *Brandi Carlile \u2013 vocals on \"Finish What We Started\u201d *Colette Carlson \u2013 background vocals *Johan Carlsson \u2013 arranger, bass guitar, clapping, drum programming, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, Hammond organ, percussion, piano, solina, synthesizer, tambourine, background vocals *Andrew DeRoberts \u2013 acoustic guitar, drum programming, electric guitar, keyboards, synthesizer bass, background vocals, wurlitzer *Michael Engstrom \u2013 upright bass *Phil Hanseroth \u2013 acoustic guitar, background vocals *Tim Hanseroth \u2013 acoustic guitar, background vocals *Luke Laird \u2013 drum programming *Tove Lo \u2013 background vocals *Max Martin \u2013 background vocals *Shawn Mendes \u2013 background vocals *Doris Sanberg \u2013 background vocals *Don Satchmo \u2013 Roland TR-808 *Sasha Sirota \u2013 background vocals, drum programming *Skrillex \u2013 electric guitar, keyboards, drum programming *Peter Svensson \u2013 nylon string guitar *Ryan Tedder \u2013 background vocals *Andrew Watt \u2013 drum programming Production *Brandon Bell \u2013 engineer, mixing *Cory Bice \u2013 engineer *Michael H.
