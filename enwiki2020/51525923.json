He has held multiple regional lightweight titles throughout his career, including the French title from 2013 to 2014; the European Union title in 2016; and the WBC Silver title in 2017. ==Professional career== In June 2013, a year after unsuccessfully taking on Viktor Postol for the WBC International Silver super lightweight title, Mendy won the French lightweight title for the first time, beating Marvin Petit. He went on to defend this title four times before trying to become European champion. In April 2015 Mendy fought Edis Tatli for the vacant EBU (European) lightweight title and was defeated by unanimous decision. On December 12, 2015 Mendy recorded a split-decision victory over Olympic gold medalist Luke Campbell on the undercard of Anthony Joshua vs. Dillian Whyte.https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/12/luke-campbell-yvan-mendy- wbc-international-title ==Professional boxing record== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\" |- ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes |- |51 |Win |44\u20135\u20131 |align=left| Jaider Parra |KO |6 (12) |13 Dec 2019 |align=left| | |- |50 |Win |43\u20135\u20131 |align=left| Diego Fabian Eligio |UD |12 |18 Jul 2019 |align=left| |align=left| |- |49 |Win |42\u20135\u20131 |align=left| Hakim Ben Ali |TKO |8 (12) |28 Mar 2019 |align=left| |align=left| |- |48 |Win |41\u20135\u20131 |align=left| Achiko Odikadze |TKO |6 (8) |26 Jan 2019 |align=left| | |- |47 |Loss |40\u20135\u20131 |align=left| Luke Campbell |UD |12 |22 Sep 2018 |align=left| | |- |46 |Win |40\u20134\u20131 |align=left| Jesus Arevalo |KO |8 (12) |14 Dec 2017 |align=left| |align=left| |- |45 |Win |39\u20134\u20131 |align=left| Florian Montels |UD |10 |12 Oct 2017 |align=left| | |- |44 |Win |38\u20134\u20131 |align=left| Javier Jose Clavero |UD |12 |26 Jun 2017 |align=left| |align=left| |- |43 |Win |37\u20134\u20131 |align=left| Juan Ocura |UD |10 |26 Mar 2017 |align=left| | |- |42 |Win |36\u20134\u20131 |align=left| Massimiliano Ballisai |KO |5 (12) |10 Nov 2016 |align=left| |align=left| |- |41 |Win |35\u20134\u20131 |align=left| Francesco Patera |UD |12 |13 May 2016 |align=left| |align=left| |- |40 |Win |34\u20134\u20131 |align=left| Samir Kasmi |TKO |9 (12) |12 Mar 2016 |align=left| |align=left| |- |39 |Win |33\u20134\u20131 |align=left| Luke Campbell |SD |12 |12 Dec 2015 |align=left| |align=left| |- |38 |Win |32\u20134\u20131 |align=left| Reynaldo Mora |TKO |3 (6) |03 Oct 2015 |align=left| | |- align=center |37 |Win |31\u20134\u20131 |align=left| Felix Lora |UD |6 |13 Jun 2015 |align=left| | |- align=center |36 |Loss |30\u20134\u20131 |align=left| Edis Tatli |UD |12 |25 Apr 2015 |align=left| |align=left| |- align=center |35 |Win |30\u20133\u20131 |align=left| Aboubeker Bechelaghem |UD |10 |31 Oct 2014 |align=left| |align=left| |- |} ==References== Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:French male boxers Category:Sportspeople from Paris Category:French people of Senegalese descent Category:Lightweight boxers ",
