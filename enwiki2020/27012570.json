Due to this identification by the white settler, a small trading center sprang up which has grown over time. Tarmac road that links the place to other towns including Nkubu and Nairobi has been connected recently. There is a proposal to connect the area to Meru National Park with tarmac road. == References == Category:Populated places in Eastern Province (Kenya) ",
