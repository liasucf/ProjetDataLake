    "text": "Nicholas J. LaRocca (October 4, 1913 \u2013 August 30, 1999) was an American Democratic Party politician who served in both houses of the New Jersey Legislature from the 33rd district. He served a partial term in the New Jersey Senate succeeding his mentor William Musto and then a single term in the New Jersey General Assembly. LaRocca was born in 1913 in Union City where he attended the local public schools. He graduated from Fordham College in 1934 and received a law degree from New York University in 1937. He worked as a legislative aide for State Senator (and Union City Mayor) William Musto at the time of Musto's removal from the Senate for his conviction on receiving kickbacks from a developer. LaRocca was essentially handpicked by Musto to be the Democratic nominee for the special election to fill the remaining 1.5 years of the Senate term. In his first bid for elected office, LaRocca defeated independent Libero Marotta, Republican Dennis Teti, and independent Carlos Munoz in a June 23, 1982 special election. In the next regular election in 1983, LaRocca and then-Assemblyman Christopher Jackman switched seats where Jackman ran for Senate and LaRocca ran for Assembly. Both won their respective races. After serving alongside Robert Ranieri for one term from the 33rd district, LaRocca did not seek reelection in 1985. He died on August 30, 1999 aged 85. ==References== Category:1913 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Fordham University alumni Category:New York University alumni Category:New Jersey lawyers Category:Politicians from Union City, New Jersey Category:New Jersey state senators Category:Members of the New Jersey General Assembly Category:New Jersey Democrats Category:20th-century American politicians ",
