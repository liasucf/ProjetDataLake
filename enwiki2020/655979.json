    "text": "A cromlech (sometimes also spelled \"cromleh\" or \"croml\u00eah\") is a megalithic construction made of large stone blocks. The word applies to two different megalithic forms in English,https://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/cromlechhttps://www.lexico.com/en/definition/cromlech the first being an altar-tomb (frequently called a \"dolmen\"), as William Borlase first denoted in 1769. A good example is at Carn Llechart. The second meaning of the name \"cromlech\" in English refers to large stone circles such as the ones found among the Carnac stones in Brittany, France.https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/cromlechhttps://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/cromlech Unlike in English, the word \"cromlech\" in many other languages (Armenian, French, Greek, Indonesian, Italian, and Spanish, e.g.) exclusively denotes a megalithic stone circle, whereas the word \"dolmen\" only is used to refer the type of megalithic altar tomb sometimes indicated by the English \"cromlech\". Also, more recently in English, scholars such as Aubrey Burl use \"cromlech\" as a synonym for \"megalithic stone circle.\"Aubrey Burl: A Guide to the Stone Circles of Britain, Ireland and Brittany.
