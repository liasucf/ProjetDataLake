Werner is a German comics character, appearing in a number of German comic books and animated films. He was created in 1978 by Br\u00f6sel (R\u00f6tger Feldmann). Werner is the most successful German comic character of all time with over 10 million books sold and over 13 million film admissions. At almost 5 million admissions in Germany, the first movie, Werner \u2013 Beinhart! (1990), is Germany's third most commercially successful film of the 1990s on the German domestic market, and #14 of Germany's most successful domestic market films of all time.See Liste erfolgreicher Filme nach Einspielergebnis und Besucherzahlen, section Die erfolgreichsten deutschen Filme (List of biggest box office hits in Germany, section German box office hits), on German Wikipedia Prior to Oder Was?, the first standalone Werner book published in 1981, since the late 1970s the Werner comics appeared in the German satirical magazine Pardon. Indeed, Oder was? was but a collection of the Werner comics that had been published in Pardon by then. The Werner books are known for their anarchic humour, often based on Northern German dialects and puns. Standard High German is rarely spoken in the books, when it is used it is usually to portray the speaker as overtly formal and square, whereas most characters employ accents and dialects placed in a lingual continuum between the common modern Northern pronunciation of High German. == Characters in the series == === Werner === The character of Werner is based on Br\u00f6sel's and his brother Andi's experiences. Werner's life is that of an unemployed biker that consists of souping up his motorcycle and consuming large amounts of beer (known as B\u00f6lkstoff in the comics). Both regularly gets him in trouble with the police and the German vehicle safety agency T\u00dcV who due to their expressed incompetency and imbecility are usually ignored and duped by Werner. In the movies, Werner is voiced by Northern German band Torfrock's singer Klaus B\u00fcchner (whereas Torfrock also wrote part of the original soundtrack of the first movie, and partly did for the sequels as well). === R\u00f6hrich === In his younger years, Werner was apprentice to plumber Meister Walter R\u00f6hrich \u2013 the situations and characters in these stories are based on Br\u00f6sel's brother Andi's apprenticeship years. In the movies, R\u00f6hrich is voiced by Andi, based upon the parodies he had done of his plumber Meister in real life ever since his apprenticeship. Due to the master craftsman being a dim-witted, crackpot tyrant, the R\u00f6hrich stories involve a lot of slapstick and comical relief. As written by Thomas Platt in the making-of book to the first movie Werner \u2013 Beinhart!, R\u00f6hrich's explosive plumbing works \"usually end in devastation rather than installation\" (\"Explosion statt Installation\"), for indeed R\u00f6hrich's working sites often look like hit by an airstrike when he is done accidentally blowing up whole buildings or covering city blocks in sewage content. In Werner \u2013 Volles Roo\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4!!!, R\u00f6hrich even manages to accidentally launch a client into outer space. In-between R\u00f6hrich and Werner in rank is R\u00f6hrich's journeyman Eckat (from \"Eckhardt\"). Eckat is considerably smarter than R\u00f6hrich and occasionally he jokes with Werner about R\u00f6hrich's incompetency behind his back, but Eckat is mostly loyal to his Meister whenever R\u00f6hrich is around. It is not quite clear though whether Werner's apprenticeship years are really a thing of the past as stories involving occasional working for R\u00f6hrich remain a mainstay within the Werner comics. R\u00f6hrich's full company name (or company slogan) is Firma R\u00f6hrich, Gas, Wasser, Sanit\u00e4r (\"R\u00f6hrich company \u2013 Gas, Water, Sanitation\"), parodied by Eckat as Firma R\u00f6hrich, Gas, Wasser, Schei\u00dfe (\"R\u00f6hrich company \u2013 Gas, water, shit\"); the latter three words (Gas, Wasser, Schei\u00dfe) have become a humorous synonym for plumbing companies and plumbing works in Northern German slang due to the first movie's popularity. A common catchphrase of R\u00f6hrich's is \"Ich glaub', die Russen sind da!\" (approximately \"The Russians have arrived!\") which has become a phrase synonymous to \"the end of the world\" in German since WWII, but R\u00f6hrich even goes so far as that he has Werner and Eckat seek for imaginary \"Russians\" hiding in his cellar. === MC Klappstuhl === Werner is a member of the biker and rocker club MC Klappstuhl (folding chair) led by their Pr\u00e4si (short for Pr\u00e4sident, \"president\") partly based upon band Torfrock's guitarist and singer Raymond Voss (who also voices the Pr\u00e4si in the movies). Due to his choleric temper, the Pr\u00e4si has little tolerance for cops or other people hindering them in their free-wheeling biker lifestyle. Being a roughneck and firebrand better not to mess with, when angered he will stereotypically bellow out that he'll \"count to one\" and then he and his gang will wreck the place down (\"Ich z\u00e4hl' bis oins, und denn is Achterbahn!\") \u2013 which usually happens on the spot. In more recent stories, the Pr\u00e4si even partly turns into a werewolf for comical effect during his notorious anger fits. If the Pr\u00e4si gets too much out of control, several MC Klappstuhl members have to hold him down and feed him Sago as a kind of rage antidote. Another important member is the vice president Herbert. He is the exact opposite of Pr\u00e4si: he always speaks with a scary calm voice. Other members of MC Klappstuhl include R\u00f6hre (lit. \"Tube\") who modified his bike into a mobile coffee machine (in order to cure common beer hangovers), and Walze (\"Barrel\") who drives a large mobile beer tub. === Other recurring characters === Andi is Werner's brother, basically a comic-book version of Br\u00f6sel's real-life brother of the same name (who also voices Andi in the movies). Bruno and Helmut are the series' commonly appearing two police officers. A kind of Laurel and Hardy pairing, Bruno is short, chubby, and very anal about all kinds of laws and regulations, while getting Werner and Andi locked up for any of their various misdemeanors (such as speeding, drunk driving, and illegal vehicle modifications) is his eternal dream, whereas Helmut is tall, skinny, and asinine, usually helpless when he is not ordered around by Bruno. Considering himself righteous law incarnate (\"denkt, er ist der Staat\", as the official Werner website puts it), pedantic Bruno is scared only by the Pr\u00e4si. Their characters are illustrated well in a short story included in Werner Eiskalt, where Bruno orders Helmut to \"measure the phon volume\" of Werner's chopper bike's tail pipe in order to prove that it violates disturbance regulations. Helmut then uses a folding rule to measure the flame and smoke shooting from the pipe, and loyally reports to his superior Bruno that it's \"ten meters fifty of phon\". Red Porsche Killer Dolmette\u00d6lfu\u00df (\"Grease Foot\") is another member of MC Klappstuhl. Being the series' Gyro Gearloose of vehicle modifications, engineering, and repairing, he wears a red overall and is usually seen with welding equipment, welder's goggles, and a wrench. \u00d6lfu\u00df is based upon a real-life acquaintance of Br\u00f6sel and Andi with the same nickname, but also on real-life Andi's passion for weird metal engineering, a feature which Andi's comic persona lacks. \u00d6lfu\u00df, both in real life and in the comics, is also the mastermind behind the Red Porsche Killer, a drag-bike with 4 Horex-engines, and the Dolmette, with 24 Dolmar Chainsaw-engines. Holgi, based upon another real-life acquaintance of the Feldmann brothers, is Werner's and Andi's rival. Holgi is a fanatic Porsche lover, considering his car far superior to any motorbike as those fancied by most other characters in the series. In fact, above-mentioned Red Porsche Killer was designed especially for a race against Holgi that first occurred in the comic book Werner Eiskalt (1985), and in 1988 even became a real-life event between Br\u00f6sel and Holgi with thousands of Werner fans gathering for the race at Hartenholm. The race was repeated in 2004 at the Lausitzring and another repeat is planned for end August 2018 at the original location. ==Books== The first book was published in 1981 and compiled shorter works from previous years, drawn in different styles. Starting with the second book the stories became longer and more coherent. While the first books were dominated by black and white line drawings, Feldman added shades of gray starting with book five, later going full color. Werner comics were first published by the German Semmel-Verlach, later by Achterbahn. German publisher Heyne Verlag reissued the first seven books in 2002. Book 12 was published by Ehapa, later this publisher also started the release of an annual hardcover edition that was planned to include the first 12 books including sketches and character studies, but was canceled due to poor commercial success. Book 13 later was published by Feldman's own Br\u00f6seline. Starting in 2019 Br\u00f6seline also published reissues of the first 12 books. Semmel Verlach * 1. Werner \u2013 Oder was? (1981) * 2.
