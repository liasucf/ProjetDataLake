    "text": "Figure 1: Diagram for the Fickett\u2013Jacobs quasistatic cycle for detonation. The paths drawn represent the series of equilibrium states occupied by the system, except during the detonation process, (step 0 to 1), the system is temporarily non-uniform. Nevertheless, the beginning and at the end of the detonation process is uniform. The Fickett\u2013Jacobs cycle is a conceptual thermodynamic cycle that allows to compute an upper limit to the amount of mechanical work obtained from a cycle using an unsteady detonation process (explosive). The Fickett\u2013Jacobs (FJ) cycle is based on Chapman\u2013Jouguet (CJ) theory, an approximation for the detonation wave\u2019s velocity during a detonation.Wintenberger, E., Shepherd, J. E. Thermodynamic cycle analysis for propagating detonations. Journal of Propulsion and Power, 2006, 22(3), 694\u201398.Vutthivithayarak, E.M. Braun, and F.K. Lu. On thermodynamic cycles for detonation engines. 28th International Symposium on Shock Waves, Volume 2. This cycle is researched for pulse detonation engines (PDE), considered to be more efficient than the classical combustion engines that are based on the Brayton or Humphrey cycles.Borys \u0141ukasik, Artur Rowi\u0144ski, Andrzej Irzycki, Krzysztof Snopkiewicz. Study of combustion chamber with a rotating detonation. Institute of Aviation \u2013 Warszawa. 2015. The FJ cycle for detonation is an elaboration of the original ideas of Jacobs (1956).Jacobs, S. J. The energy of detonation. Navord Report 4366, U.S. Naval Ordnance Laboratory. 1956. The first to propose applying thermodynamic cycles to detonation was Yakov Zeldovich in 1940. In his work, he concluded that the efficiency of the detonation cycle is slightly larger than that of previous constant-volume combustion cycles. Zeldovich\u2019s ideas were not known to Jacbos or Fickett.Parvel V. Bulat and Konstantine N.Volkov. Detonation Jet Engine. Part 1 \u2013 Thermodynamic Cycle, 2016. VOL. 11, NO. 12, 5009-5019Eric Wintenberger. Application of Steady and Unsteady Detonation Waves to Propulasion. California Institute of Technology. 2004. Since 1940, serious attempts have been discussed for detonating propulsion systems, nevertheless, until today, no practical approach has been found. Detonation is the process by which material is very rapidly burned and converted into energy (extremely high combustion rate). The major difficulty involved in the process is the necessity to rapidly mix the fuel and air at high speeds and sustaining the detonation in a controllable manner.Kailasanath K. Review of Propulsion Applications of Detonation Waves. U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. 2000. ==Thermodynamic Cycle Model== The FJ cycle is based on a closed piston-cylinder where the reactants and explosion products are constantly contained inside. The explosives, pistons, and cylinder define the closed thermodynamic system. In addition, the cylinder and the pistons are assumed to be rigid, massless, and adiabatic.Fickett, W. and Davis, W. C., Detonation Theory and Experiment, Dover Publications Inc., 2001, Chap. 2, pp. 35\u201338. The ideal FJ cycle consists of five processes: #Reactants are isentropically compressed: Applying external work to move one piston at velocity up instantaneously initiating a detonation front at the piston\u2019s surface. The detonation wave propagates, and the decomposition products follows it in a uniform state at velocity up. Once it reaches the second piston, the entire piston-cylinder arrangement moves at a constant velocity up. #The kinetic energy produced during the first process is converted into external work. #Adiabatical expansion: The gaseous detonation products return to a final pressure equal to the initial pressure, \u03a10. #Heat extraction: The gaseous products are reversibly cooled at a constant pressure to reach the initial temperature \u03a40. #The cycle is completed by converting the products into reactants, as in the initial conditions. The entire cycle is shown in Figure 1. The net work done by the system is equal to the sum of the work done during each step of the cycle. Since all processes in the cycles shown in Figure 2 are reversible, except for the detonation process, the work computed is an upper limit to the work that can be obtained during any cyclic process with a propagating detonation as the combustion step. ==Mathematical interpretation of the cycle\u2019s total work == In the following equations, all subscripts correspond to the different steps in the Fickett\u2013Jacobs cycle as shown in Figure 2. In addition, a representation of the work done by the system and the external work applied on the system is shown is Figure 1. Initially, the work done to the system to begin a cycling detonation is W_i = -P_i A u_p(t-t_0) Figure 2: An schematic representation of the different steps in the Fickett\u2013Jacobs cycle. a) Applying external force to move the piston at velocity up, and simultaneous detonation of the explosives (UCJ is the speed of the wave front of the detonation) . b) Acceleration of piston \u0391 to the right. c) Conversion of mechanical work to external work by decelerating the detonation products. d) Expansion of the products to atmospheric pressure. e) Heat extraction and constant pressure. f) Conversion of products to reactants at constant temperature and pressure. Where \u03a1i is the initial pressure applied to unit area \u0391 and velocity up from time t-t_0 . The time to reach the end of the cylinder is calculated using length L of the cylinder and the propagation wave\u2019s velocity (approximated by Chapman\u2013Jouguet ), UCJ: t-t_0 = \\frac{L}{U_{CJ}}. The fact that the mass of the explosive is M = \\rho L A, where \u03c1 is the explosive\u2019s density, the equation above becomes W_i = - \\frac{P_i u_p}{\\rho U_{CJ}} The work done by the system (detonation) per unit mass of explosive is W_{01} = \\frac{1}{2}u_{p}^2 The work done by the adiabatic expansion of the reaction products is W_{12} = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} PdV Where \u03a1 is the pressure on the isentrope through state 1, and V2 is the specific volume on that isentrope at the initial pressure \u03a10. The work done through steps 2 to 0 (including 3) was considered by Fickett to be negligible, nevertheless, it is added in order to have a complete thermodynamic cycle and be consistent with the First Law of Thermodynamics. The additional work is W_{20} = -P_0(V_0 - V_2) The total work done by the system is then W_{tot} = W_i + W_{01} + W_{12} + W_{20} = W_i + H_0 - H_2 Where H_0 - H_2 is the enthalpy difference between steps 0 to 2 (passing through step 3). ===Thermal Efficiency=== The thermal efficiency of the FJ cycle is the ratio between the net work done to the specific heat of combustion. \\eta = \\frac{W_{tot}}{q_c} = \\frac{H_0 - H_2}{q_c} Where qc is the specific heat of combustion, defined as the enthalpy difference between the reactants and the products at initial pressure and temperature: q_c = H_0 - H_3 . The FJ cycle overall shows the amount of work available from a detonating system.Ernest. L. Baker and Leonard I.Stiel. Optimu, Performance of explosives in a quasistatic detonation cycle. NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering. 2017. The thermal efficiency for the FJ cycle is shown to be dependent on its initial pressure. The thermal e\ufb03ciency decreases when the initial pressure decreases due to the increasing in dissociation at low pressures. Dissociation is an endothermic process, hence reducing the amount of energy released in a detonation or the maximum amount of work that can be obtained from the FJ cycle. Exothermic reactions are encouraged when increasing the initial pressure of the system, hence, increasing the amount of work generated during the FJ cycle. ==See also== * Thermodynamic Cycle * Humphrey Cycles * Brayton Cycles ==References== Category:Thermodynamic cycles ",
