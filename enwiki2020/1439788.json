    "text": "Abatai (Manchu: 14px; 27 July 1589 - 10 May 1646) was a Manchu prince and military general of the early Qing dynasty. Although an inconsistent and dissolute malcontent, he nevertheless showed considerable ability as a military leader and administrator. ==Life== Abatai was born in the Manchu Aisin Gioro clan, the imperial clan of the Qing dynasty, as part of the Plain Blue Banner. He was the seventh son of Nurhaci, the khan of the Later Jin dynasty, the precursor of the Qing dynasty. His mother, who was from the Irgen Gioro (\u4f0a\u723e\u6839\u89ba\u7f85) clan, was a concubine of Nurhaci. Abatai led Later Jin forces to attack the tribes of Weji in 1611 and those of Jarut in 1623. He was disciplined for abandoning his colleagues during a raid on territories of the Ming Empire in 1629. He was also held responsible for the loss of Yongping and other conquered Ming cities in 1629 and 1630. In 1631, Abatai was appointed to the Manchu Board of Works. He was reprimanded for incompetence at the siege of Dalian in 1633 but reformed his conduct, and with his younger half-brother Ajige, he reputedly fought and won 56 engagements. He was handsomely rewarded in 1636 for his achievements in battle. In 1641, Abatai was stripped of his ranks for withdrawing without permission during the siege of Jinzhou in 1641. He then led a raiding force into northern China, advancing into Zhili, Shandong and Jiangsu from 1642 to 1643. In 1644, Abatai was granted the title \"Prince Raoyu of the Second Rank\" (\u9952\u9918\u90e1\u738b), and in the following year he was placed in command of the military in Shandong. He died in 1646. ==Family== * Father: Nurhaci, Taizu (; 8 April 1559 \u2013 30 September 1626) ** Grandfather: Taksi, Xianzu (; 1543\u20131583) ** Grandmother: Empress Xuan, of the Hitara clan (; d. 1569), personal name Emeci () * Mother: Secondary consort, of the Irgen Gioro clan () \\---- * Consorts and Issue: ** Primary consort, of the Nara clan () *** \u0160anggiyan, Prince Xianque of the Fourth Rank (; 1606\u20131630), first son *** Bohoto, Prince Wenliang of the Fourth Rank (; 1610 \u2013 October/November 1648), second son *** Bolo, Prince Duanzhongding of the First Rank (; 1613 \u2013 23 April 1652), third son *** Yolo, Prince Anhe of the First Rank (; 19 October 1625 \u2013 15 March 1689), fourth son *** Hedu (), fifth son *** First daughter **** Married Li Yongfang (; d. 1634) in 1618 *** Second daughter **** Married Ingg\u016bldai (; 1596\u20131648) of the Manchu Tatara clan ** Mistress, of the Ulanghaigimot clan (\u4e4c\u4eae\u6d77\u6d4e\u6478\u7279\u6c0f) *** Seventh daughter **** Married Chuo'erji (; d. 1670) of the Khorchin Borjigit clan, and had issue (Empress Xiaohuizhang) *** A daughter who married Bu'erhatu () ==See also== * Royal and noble ranks of the Qing dynasty * Ranks of Imperial Consorts in China#Qing ==References== * * * Category:1589 births Category:1646 deaths Category:Manchu politicians Category:Nurhaci's sons Category:House of Aisin Gioro Category:Manchu Plain Blue Bannermen ",
