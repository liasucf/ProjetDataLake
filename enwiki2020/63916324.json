    "text": "Elvira Fortunato OIDH (born 22 July, 1964 in Almada) is a Portuguese scientist. She is a full professor in the Materials Science Department at the NOVA University of Lisbon (FCT-UNL). Fortunato is a scientist and innovator in the field of paper electronics, including transistors, memories, sensors, batteries, displays, antennas and solar cells. == Education == Fortunato received her Engineering Diploma in Materials Science and Physics in 1987 from the FCT-UNL and continued her graduate studies in the same university. In 1991 Fortunato received her Master's degree in Semiconductor Materials and in 1995 her Ph.D. in Microelectronics and Optoelectronics. In 2005 Fortunato obtained her habilitation in the same field. == Career == After her Ph.D., Fortunato was offered the position of assistant professor in 1995 at the NOVA University of Lisbon. In 1998 Fortunato was promoted to associate professor and since then has been the director of the Materials Research Center (CENIMAT) of the Associate Laboratoryi3N, the Institute of Nanostructures, Nanomodeling, and Nanofabrication. At the CENIMAT Fortunato lead the research team which has been distinguished for the discovery of the paper transistor. In 2012, she was made a full professor at the FCT-UNL and since 2017, Fortunato is the vice- rector at NOVA University. Fortunato is an elected member of Academy of Engineering (2008), European Academy of Sciences (2016), Lisbon Academy of Sciences (2018) and Academia Europaea (2018). She belongs to the Board of Trustees of the Luso-American Development Foundation (2014). Fortunato is Associate Editor of Rapid Research Letters Physica Status Solidi since 2006 (Wiley), Co-Editor of Europhysics Letters since 2011 and is an Editorial Advisory Board Member of ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (since 2020). == Research == Fortunato's research focuses on exploring new electronic active materials that are environmentally friendly and compatible with flexible electronics. This led to the invention of the first paper transistor in 2008, which used paper, a low-cost and flexible biopolymer, as the insulator layer (gate dielectric) of a thin-film transistor, replacing the commonly used Silicon. Fortunato's research includes transparent and paper electronics; electrochemical devices and biosensors and microfluidics. Her research includes the development of new materials and processes for conventional thin film technology, with a focus on exploiting the materials\u2019 performances at a nanoscale. Applications for these devices include the electronics and optoelectronics industry. She pioneered European research on transparent electronics, namely thin-film transistors based on oxide semiconductors, demonstrating that oxide materials can be used as true semiconductors. === Paper Electronics === Paper electronics consists of substituting the components of a transistor, e.g. silicon or other inorganic materials, commonly used as the insulating component, by cellulose, i.e. paper. This makes the chips inexpensive, recyclable and environmentally friendly. The idea is to print the components on a flexible paper surface and additionally use the cellulose as the dielectric layer of the transistor, i.e. its insulating component. This way, the paper does not only serve as the substrate but also integrated as a functional part of the device. Although paper electronics might not replace all the silicon technology from today, this technology can be added to existing technologies and is suitable for low-cost and large scale applications. Further scientific applications include biosensors, radiofrequency identification (RFID) tags in shipping and product inventory management == Honors and Awards == Fortunato has received national and international awards for her work. In 2005 Fortunato received the prize for Scientific Excellence from the Portuguese Science Foundation (FCT-MCTES). In 2009, she was cited by the Portuguese Parliament for her research. In 2010, she was awarded membership in the Order of Prince Henry by then-Portuguese President An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva. In 2015, she was President of Portugal Day. In 2016 she was awarded the Blaise Pascal Medal in materials science by the European Academy of Sciences and in 2017, the Czochralski award in recognition of her research work in the area of Advanced Materials Science. In 2018, she received a European Research Council grant worth \u20ac 3.5 million, the largest grant ever awarded to a Portuguese researcher at the time of the award.. == References == == External links == * Elvira Fortunato profile at FCT-UNL * Elvira's Fortunato group * Advanced Science News: Elvira Fortunato and Rodrigo Martins named European Inventor Award 2016 finalists * Paper electronics: a sustainable multifunctional platform Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:Members of Academia Europaea Category:People from Almada Category:Portuguese physicists Category:Portuguese scientists Category:Portuguese women scientists Category:NOVA University Lisbon alumni Category:NOVA University Lisbon faculty Category:Materials scientists and engineers Category:Portuguese inventors ",
