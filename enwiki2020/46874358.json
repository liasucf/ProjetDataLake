    "text": "The participation of Tatarstan in the Bala Turkvision Song Contest was originally planned to begin in Istanbul, Turkey, at the inaugural Bala Turkvision Song Contest in 2015. Maidan Television (MTV) was responsible for the selection process of their participant, for their debut in 2015. Said\u00e4 M\u00f6x\u00e4mm\u00e4tcanova was selected as Tatarstan's first representative for the Bala Turkvision Song Contest 2015. However, they were forced to withdraw from the contest on 7 December 2015, due to the Russia\u2013Turkey relations in the aftermath of the 2015 Russian Sukhoi Su-24 shootdown near the Syria\u2013Turkey border on 24 November 2015. ==Origins of the contest== The Republic of Tatarstan, located in Russia. Bala Turkvision is an annual song contest. Based on the similar format of the Junior Eurovision Song Contest, Bala Turkvision focuses primarily on participating Turkic countries and regions. A juror from each nation awards between 1 and 10 points for every entry, except their own. In the Grand Final the jury determines the winner. Unlike the Junior Eurovision Song Contest in which the winning country proceeds to host the following year's event, hosting of the Bala Turkvision Song Contest takes place in the country or region that is also hosting the Turkish Capital of Culture. ==History== ===Bala Turkvision Song Contest 2015=== The Tatar broadcaster, Maidan Television (MTV), announced on 2 June 2015 that they would be making their Bala Turkvision debut at the 2015 contest in Istanbul, Turkey on 15 December 2015. MTV internally selected Said\u00e4 M\u00f6x\u00e4mm\u00e4tcanova as their representative at the inaugural contest. However, they were forced to withdraw from the contest on 7 December 2015, due to the Russia\u2013Turkey relations in the aftermath of the 2015 Russian Sukhoi Su-24 shootdown near the Syria\u2013Turkey border on 24 November 2015. ===Bala Turkvision Song Contest 2016=== On 8 December 2016, it was announced that both the Turkvision Song Contest 2016 and Bala Turkvision Song Contest 2016 had been delayed until March 2017, marking the first time since either of the inaugural contests, that a postponement had occurred. However, it was later confirmed that both of the 2016 contests had been cancelled due to the December 2016 Istanbul bombings. The contest was rescheduled to take place at the Saryarka Velodrome, in Astana, Kazakhstan. ==Participation== ;Table key {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\" |- ! Year ! Artist !
