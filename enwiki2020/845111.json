Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica regards Qashqai as an independent third group of dialects within the Southwestern Turkic language group. It is known to speakers as Turki. Estimates of the number of Qashqai speakers vary. Ethnologue gave a figure of 949,000 in 2015. The Qashqai language is closely related to Azerbaijani, also known as Azeri. However, some Qashqai varieties namely the variety spoken in the Sheshbeyli tribe share features with Turkish.Dolatkhah Sohrab. 2016. Le qashqay: langue turcique d'Iran. CreateSpace: Independent Publishing PlatformCaferoglu & Gerhard Doerfer, 1959 In a sociopolitical sense, though, Qashqai is considered a language in its own right. Like other Turkic languages spoken in Iran, such as the Azerbaijani language, Qashqai uses a modified version of the Perso-Arabic script. == Phonology == === Consonants === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=text- align:center |+Consonants of Qashqai |- ! colspan=\"2\" | !
