    "text": "Twenty is a compilation album by British electronic dance music act Chicane, released on 29 July 2016 through Modena Records The album is in two parts; the first half being a remix album, and the second being a greatest hits compilation. However another greatest hits album, The Best of Chicane: 1996\u20132008, has been previously released. Exclusive songs are featured on the album, including its single \"Carry Me Home\" (with Steve Edwards), a rework of the song of the same name by gospel house group Gloworm. The album's title refers to Chicane's twentieth anniversary in the music industry. ==Background== As with his previous greatest hits album, \"No Ordinary Morning\", \"Don't Give Up\" and \"Saltwater\" are re-recordings, as the original recordings were still owned by Xtravaganza and were unable to be licensed for this compilation due to a dispute between Chicane and the label's boss Alex Gold, dated back to 2002. Chicane's previous recordings which had been distributed by Edel Records in 1996/1997 are featured in their original form as Xtravaganza lost the rights to them, with \"Strong In Love\" being released for the first time since its original release in 1998. ==Track listing== ===CD & digital download=== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Chart (2016) !Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Albums (OCC) | 40 |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Album Downloads (OCC) | 18 |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Album Sales (OCC) | 26 |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Dance Albums (OCC) | 1 |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Independent Albums (OCC) | 5 |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Physical Albums (OCC) | 52 |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Vinyl Albums (OCC) | 35 |- !scope=\"row\"| US Dance/Electronic Albums (Billboard) |style=\"text-align:center;\"|25 |} ==References== Category:2016 compilation albums Category:Chicane (musician) albums ",
