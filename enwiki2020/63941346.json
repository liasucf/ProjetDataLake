    "text": "==1990s== {| class=\"wikitable\" |-Fb ! width=5%| Year ! style=\"width:10%;\"| Name of victim(s) ! style=\"width:15%;\"| Location body found ! style=\"width:70%e;\"| Notes |- |8 January 1990 |William Howe |Worthing, West Sussex |The body of the 63-year-old retired vet was found tied up in his flat on 9 January. Because the flat had been ransacked, and because Mr Howe had tens of thousands of pounds hidden in a safe there (which the attackers didn't find), robbery is thought to have been the motive for the killing. In the period leading up to his death, he was tortured by being hit with a hammer and having his back stamped or kneeled on, suffering broken ribs as a consequence. The cause of death was asphyxia, and it is believed he died the day before police found his body. |- |17 January 1990 |Doris Kellett |Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire |Doris Kellett was a 92-year-old who was hammered to death in her own home. It is likely that the person who struck the fatal blows to her head had an accomplice, for a witness reported having seen two men (one with a clipboard) talking to Doris on her doorstep about 45 minutes before her home help discovered her body. Her pension money was missing from the house, along with a ring and an amber paperweight. There are suspicions that her killer tricked his way in by pretending to be a gasman or some other type of official. |- |29 January 1990 |Surinder Gill |Hounslow, West London |Surinder Gill was an insurance salesman who drove a distinctive modified dark red Mercedes with the index plate 16 GLL. He was found stabbed to death in his car in Beavers Open Space, Hounslow. Events leading up to his murder were reconstructed on Crimewatch in April 1990. |- |February 1990 |Kevin Childerley |Mansfield, Nottinghamshire |Intruders armed with weapons attacked 29-year-old Kevin Childerley and his wife as they lay in bed, leading to his death and to her losing the sight in her right eye. Police charged two men with the murder of Mr Childerley and the attempted murder of Mrs Childerley, but when the case came to trial in 1991, they were cleared \u2013 in part because the judge considered Mrs Childerley's testimony unreliable because a medical expert didn't believe she had genuine memories of the attacks. |- | March 1990 || Jack Royal || Sunniside, Tyne and Wear || Jack Royal, 57, was shot dead with a shotgun in the porch of his house. The science teacher had himself killed someone in January 1987, although a jury accepted his claim that he had been acting in self-defence and found him not guilty accordingly. In April 1990, a local man was charged with Jack's murder. The 21-year-old's sister had, at the time of his death in 1987, been the partner of the man killed by Jack, and this was viewed as a motive. However, he was cleared in June 1991. In 1993, a second person was tried for Jack's murder. As with the previous defendant, someone close to him having a connection to the man Jack had fatally stabbed (in this case his girlfriend, who was the sister of that man) was viewed as a motive, and he spent nearly 14 years in prison for the murder before his conviction was overturned in 2007. |- | June 1990 || Leonard Gomm || Bletchingdon, Oxfordshire || Mr Gomm, 75, was a taxicab driver found stabbed to death in Hampton Gay, near Bletchingdon in Oxfordshire, at 10:50am on 13 June 1990. His Ford Granada taxi was found five yards away. Mr Gomm had radioed his employers four hours earlier (at about 6:35am) telling them he was taking a passenger to Bicester. Police believe he picked up the fare from Gloucester Green, Oxford. Two witnesses saw the victim driving his taxi with a passenger at around this time. No money or valuables had been taken from Mr Gomm or his taxi leaving the motive as to his murder a mystery. On the 20th anniversary of the murder, Thames Valley Police reported the uncovering of new forensic evidence which could shed light on the motive. |- | 3 August 1990 || Ann Heron || Aeolian House, Darlington, County Durham || The mother-of-three had her throat slit while sunbathing outside her family home. Her husband, Peter, found the body and was later charged with her murder but the case collapsed. Nobody else has been charged with the murder. There has been a suggestion that Ann's murder could be linked to convicted killer Christopher Halliwell. |- |August 1990 |Brian Adams |Derby |48-year-old Brian Adams was the victim of a fatal shooting just outside his Alvaston home after returning there on his motorcycle on 14 August 1990. Why someone wanted him dead remains unclear. |- |August 1990 |Frank Harris |Leeds |Frank Harris, 26, was stabbed to death at a street party following an argument about a sound system. The murder, which a Birmingham man went on trial for but wasn't found guilty of, happened not long after the West Indian Carnival (an event that has taken place in Leeds annually since 1967) had officially come to an end and just hours before Sedley Sullivan and Rachel Soloman were murdered in the same street \u2013 a street fairly close to where people had earlier been enjoying the carnival proper. |- |August 1990 |Sedley Sullivan and Rachel Soloman |Leeds |It is believed that Sedley Sullivan was the intended target of this possibly drugs-related shooting in Harehills Avenue and that 18-year-old Rachel Soloman was killed as well by accident. Anthony Johnson (himself the victim of a gangland killing several months later) was suspected of being behind the double murder but not picked out at an identification parade. |- |September 1990 |Gail Whitehouse |Wolverhampton |Someone strangled 23-year-old Gail Whitehouse, a mother-of-two, and left her body in bushes in Wolverhampton's red-light district. Convicted serial rapist, David Williams, was acquitted of her murder in 1993. |- | December 1990 || Steven Johnson || Mow Cop, Cheshire/Staffordshire border || On 22 December, insurance salesman and part- time taxi driver Steven Johnson was last sighted at 3:30am collecting a fare in Hanley bound for Packmoor. His body was discovered by a dog walker four hours later with his throat cut 20 yards from his taxi. |- |January 1991 |Maria Requena |Leigh, Greater Manchester |26-year-old Maria Christina Requena went missing on New Year's Day 1991, and her remains were found on 6 January in five plastic bin bags in the lake at Pennington Flash. Maria was a sex worker and the location where she was found is less than two miles from where the body of Linda Donaldson was discovered in 1988. A link between the two murders has been suggested and a connection has also been suggested with the murder of Julie Finley. |- |February 1991 |Janine Downes |Shifnal, Shropshire |Janine Downes was a 22-year-old mother of three. Her body was found close to Lambert's Restaurant on the road between Shifnal and Wolverhampton on 2 February 1991. Janine had been strangled and had extensive head injuries, some of her clothes were missing. Janine had been a sex worker and was last seen in Wolverhampton's red light district. A link has been suggested with the murder of Sharon Harper in 1994 and a possible connection with the convicted killer Christopher Halliwell. |- |February 1991 |Anthony \"White Tony\" Johnson |Cheetham Hill, Manchester |Known as \"White Tony\" to avoid confusion with a black associate whose first name was the same as his, he was shot dead on 22 February in the Penny Black pub's car park. A man he was with was also shot, but not killed. Desmond Noonan was tried for Tony's murder twice (along with alleged accomplices, including brother Damien at the first trial), and the prosecution claimed that Tony had been murdered because someone had threatened to complain to him about Desmond taking half of his share of the money from an armed robbery. However, each trial collapsed due to a hung jury. Aged 22 at the time of his death, Tony was a grandson of Winnie Johnson, mother of moors murders victim Keith Bennett, and had begun to descend into a life of crime within a few years of leaving school. |- |April 1991 |Alan Leppard |Monkton, Kent |43-year-old Alan Leppard was shot in the chest on Easter Monday after answering his front door. Brenda Long, his partner, heard the bang and rushed to the door to find out what the cause of it was, and she, too, was murdered at home just under nine months later. With no evidence that either of them had done anything illegal or was prone to making enemies, the reasons for the killings remain as mysterious as the identities of the persons behind them. |- |May 1991 |Glenda Potter |Rochester, Kent |Someone strangled 32-year-old Glenda Potter and left her body near the United Reformed Church in Crow Lane, Rochester in May 1991. Glenda was a sex worker and her murder was featured on Crimewatch. Police re-examined the case in 2010, stating that they had DNA from the scene. |- | June 1991 || Alison Shaughnessy || Battersea, London || Bank clerk Alison Shaughnessy was knifed over 50 times on the stairway to her flat on 3 June. Sisters Michelle and Lisa Taylor were convicted of murdering the 21-year-old and sentenced to life imprisonment in July 1992, but had their convictions quashed the following year, by which time they were aged 22 and 19, respectively. Michelle and Alison's husband had been having an affair prior to the killing (though both claimed it had ended by then \u2013 something the police didn't accept), and the accusation was that Michelle, fuelled by jealousy, had stabbed Alison while her sister stood guard. An entry from Michelle's 1990 diary stating that her \"dream solution would be for Alison to disappear as if she never existed\" was used as evidence against her at the trial. |- | June 1991 || Penny Bell || Perivale, London || The body of the victim, a 43-year-old businesswoman and mother of two, was found in a car in Gurnell Leisure Centre car park by two women who initially thought her corpse was just a woman sleeping. She had been stabbed 50 times as she sat behind the wheel of her car. |- | June 1991 || Lynne Trenholm || Boughton, Chester || Lynne Trenholm was found dead in Pinky's massage parlour in Boughton, Chester on 9 June 1991. She had been stabbed multiple times. Despite there being a solid fingerprint recovered from the scene, the police have no suspect and appeals are still made in an effort to solve Trenholm's murder. |- | June 1991 || Sandy Drummond || Fife, Scotland || Reclusive Sandy Drummond, 33, was found dead on a farm track close to the home he shared with his brother, an isolated cottage near St Andrews, Fife, on 24 June 1991. Just days prior to his death, Drummond had withdrawn large amounts of cash from his accounts, although the money was later found in the house. He had also resigned from his job three days before his death. On the day itself, he was seen running from his house to fields opposite carrying a blue sports bag which has never been found. At 2:30pm, a man was seen on a bus near to Drummond's cottage with a blood stained bandage wrapped around his hand. This man was never traced. Several occasions before Drummond's death (and twice on the actual day), an orange Morris Marina was seen parked outside the cottage, but it is still unknown who owned this car or who visited him. Drummond's death was originally ruled as natural, but forensics later revealed he had injuries to his neck. |- |July 1991 |Sheila Egner |Nottingham |At Yeomans Army Stores (where Mrs Egner was working) on Mansfield Road, the 62-year-old was hit over the head repeatedly with a bottle or hammer by someone who then took the till drawer (which contained about \u00a3250) away with him after wrapping it in green curtain. The drawer was found dumped and empty in a garden in Basford the following day. |- |August 1991 |Sharon Hoare |Fulham, London |19-year-old Sharon Hoare moved from her home in Bristol to London, where she worked as a sex worker for escort agencies. Sharon's flatmate found her dead in her bedroom at their home on Brompton Park Crescent, Fulham. She had been throttled and bludgeoned. Her boyfriend was questioned but released without charge. Six days after Sharon's death, another sex worker was attacked at her home in nearby Kensington and it was suggested the two attacks could be linked. |- |August 1991 |Brendan Penn |Bradford, West Yorkshire |Father-of-three Brendan Penn, aged 22, was stabbed in the heart after running into a group of people already involved in a street affray. A detective later noted that he thought there were people with important information about the murder who were unwilling to come forward with it because they wrongly believed Brendan to have been an aggressor. |- |August 1991 |Andrew Elphick |Body not found |The disappearance of 21-year-old Andrew Elphick began to be treated as murder in 1995. Andrew was last seen in Brookwood, Surrey on 23 August 1991, and his car was found abandoned in Slough \u2013 approximately 18 miles away \u2013 the following day. Andrew worked in a shop in Woking and lived in Normandy. In 1995, three men were arrested in connection with Andrew's disappearance but no charges were brought against any of them. |- |August 1991 |Veronica Anderson |Warrington, Cheshire |42-year-old Veronica 'Vera' Anderson was found in her Ford Cortina on Tannery Lane, Penketh, Warrington on 25 August 1991. Her throat had been cut. Vera had last been seen at her home address on Hadfield Close, Widnes the previous day. That evening, she received a telephone call, then left her six-year-old son with a neighbour. It was not expected that she would be gone for long. |- |August 1991 |Sarah Crump |Southall, London |Sarah Crump, 31, was found murdered at her home in Southall, west London on 31 August 1991. She had been stabbed. Two years later, David Smith stood trial for Sarah's murder but was acquitted. The same man was jailed in 1999 for the murder of a 21-year-old sex worker, Amanda Walker, who he had picked up near Paddington Station, London. |- |September 1991 |Sarah Bowdler |Walsall, West Midlands |Sarah Bowdler, a 68-year-old charity worker and widow, was found strangled in her bedroom at her home on Somers Road, Pleck, Walsall, on 17 September 1991. No motive for her murder was established: nothing had been stolen and the fact that there was no sign of a break-in suggested that Sarah had let her killer into her home. |- | October 1991 || The Bolney Torso || Bolney, Sussex || In October 1991 a body was discovered in woodland off Broxmead Lane in Bolney, Sussex. The head and hands had been removed and the victim was never identified. In March 2009 police exhumed the body and gave a revised description of the victim. He was between 5 ft 6 and 5 ft 8 ins tall, well built and aged 35\u201345. Police also issued pictures of his clothing, including a light-blue shirt with a distinctive motif on its pocket. |- |October 1991 |Diane McInally |Glasgow |Diane McInally, 23, was last seen getting into a car with two men in Cadogan Street, Glasgow, on 15 October 1991. Her body was found in woodland in the city's Pollok Park and she had been strangled. Diane was a sex worker and two men were charged with her murder but there wasn't enough evidence for them to stand trial. In 2017, Diane's son claimed he had new evidence for the investigation into his mother's murder to be reopened. |- | December 1991 || Nicola Payne || Body not found || Nicola Payne, aged 18, went missing from the Henley Green area of Coventry on 14 December 1991. She was on her way to her parents' house from her home in Winston Avenue. She had a six-month-old son at the time of her disappearance. In June 2012 police began a search of parkland after being given new information. On 20 June 2012, Nigel Barwell and his brother-in-law Thomas O'Reilly were arrested by the police but later released. On 27 January 2015, Barwell and O'Reilly were charged with her murder. However, on 16 November 2015, Barwell and O'Reilly were found not guilty of murdering Payne A tent which appeared to show DNA evidence against the defendants had been stored in uncertain conditions for a month and cross contamination was possible. |- |December 1991 |Brenda Long |Whitstable, Kent |Because there was a suicide note next to the bath in which Brenda Long's body was found and an empty pill packet was in the bath as well, foul play was not suspected to begin with, but an examination of the body by a pathologist revealed that someone had caused her to fall unconscious by holding a cloth soaked with ether over her nose before drowning her. The murder followed that of her partner, Alan Leppard, in April of the same year, and his is also still unsolved. |- |December 1991 |Kathleen Waugh |Derwent Reservoir, Derbyshire |Kathleen Waugh was 41 years old when she went missing one night from Knowl House care home, in Ashton-under-Lyne, Tameside. Her body was found floating in Derwent Reservoir early in 1992, six weeks after her disappearance. The location was 25 miles from where she lived. Kathleen had an intellectual disability and the deputy care manager of Knowl House was arrested then released, she denied all charges against her. Kathleen's murder was explored in an episode of ITV's documentary series Network First - The Killing of Kathleen Waugh in March 1996. |- |January 1992 |Yvonne Fitt |Lindley Wood, near Otley, West Yorkshire |Yvonne Fitt was last seen in Bradford on 6 January 1992 but her body wasn't found until 12 September in Otley. Her murder was featured on Crimewatch that year and in 2019 police appealed to an anonymous caller who provided information after the broadcast to call again. It's suspected that Yvonne could have been murdered by the killer of Leanne Tiernan. |- | January 1992 || Perry Wenham || Ipswich, Suffolk || Two men were charged with the murder of Perry Wenham but the judge at their trial ruled in their favour, describing the evidence against them as \"deplorably weak\". The case rested mainly on the fact that on the night of the murder, the men were seen with Mr Wenham in the town centre when he was still alive before being seen without him and walking away rather quickly from the lane whose church's graveyard his stabbed body was later found in \u2013 a lane also in the centre of town. During a police interview, one of them admitted to seeing 31-year-old Mr Wenham get punched to the ground that night, but denied hurting him himself in any way. |- | January 1992 || Tracey Meade || Grand Union Canal, London || On 20 January 1992, 14-year-old Tracey Meade said goodbye to her mother (Kim) and went off to stay the night at her aunt's flat nearby. It happened so often that Kim did not give it a second thought. But Tracey never arrived. Twelve days later her body was found in the Grand Union Canal. She had drowned but was found to have been stabbed twice and police think there may have been a sexual motive as she was only partially dressed and some of her clothes were found elsewhere. A reconstruction was featured on Crimewatch in April 1992, but police are no nearer to finding the killer. Tracey's family are still seeking answers and will continue to fight for the truth of what happened to her. |- |March 1992 |Beatrice Greig |Nottingham |79-year-old Beatrice Greig was beaten to death at her home in Loughrigg Close, The Meadows, Nottingham on 28 March 1992. Beatrice's daughter, Patricia Bass, was convicted of her mother's murder but the conviction was quashed in 1996 and a retrial ordered. Patricia Bass was convicted a second time at the retrial in 1997 and this conviction was overturned the following year. |- |April 1992 |Jacqueline Palmer-Radford |Eversley, Hampshire |The 40-year-old was found dead in her kitchen by her elder son on 1 April, having been raped and asphyxiated while he was at school earlier that day. Nothing was stolen from the house and there was no sign of forced entry, leading investigators to consider it likely that the perpetrator was not a stranger to her. |- |April 1992 |Michael Schallamach |Body not found |After Michael Schallamach vanished in Southampton, his wife received a letter posted in France and purportedly from a woman he had left her for, but the police, having long been of the opinion that he had been murdered by the time the letter was written, do not believe it was authentic. In 2016, two men jailed in 2005 for killing a family in 2003 were named as prime suspects in the murder of 53-year-old Mr Schallamach. |- |July 1992 |Christopher Stanley |Hounslow, London |Nine-year-old Christopher Stanley was last seen on 29 July 1992 talking with a friend and a neighbour on St Aubyn's Avenue, Hounslow. His body was found the next day in a wartime pill box on Hounslow Heath, he had been strangled. A man stood trial for Christopher's murder the following year but was acquitted. |- | October 1992 || Kevin Coniam || Mansfield, Nottinghamshire || The Kent-born lorry driver's Volvo Estate car was found with his body inside in woodland close to the northern outskirts of Mansfield. He had been strangled \u2013 police think by someone he had been associating with for drug-related reasons. |- | October 1992 || Nikki Allan || Sunderland || Seven-year-old Nikki Allan was battered to death in the then- derelict Exchange Building. George Heron, 24, a neighbour of the victim, was subsequently charged with her murder. However, at his trial the case collapsed as it was deemed that his confession had been gained by coercion. In 2006, police confirmed that Nikki Allan's murder was being reinvestigated by a \"cold case\" review team based at Northumbria Police's headquarters. In September 2013, the BBC's Crimewatch made a second appeal and showed another reconstruction in an attempt to solve the case. In 2017, a DNA profile was recovered from samples taken at the scene and in 2019 a man was re-arrested. He was released under investigation as inquiries continued. |- | November 1992 || Natalie Pearman || Norwich, Norfolk || 16-year-old Natalie was strangled and her body dumped in woodland at Ringland Hills, on the edge of Norwich. At around 3:45am on 20 November, a lorry driver taking a short cut through Ringland Hills spotted Natalie's body in a layby. New information about the case was received in November 2012. |- |November/December 1992 |Harold, Mary and Harold Jr Smith |Birmingham |Harold Smith, 72, his wife Mary, 72, and their son Harold Jnr, 47, were found murdered in a bedroom of their home in Overbury Close, Northfield, Birmingham on 2 December 1992. They had been bound, beaten and stabbed with a small knife. Nothing appeared to have been stolen and the motive remains a mystery. Criminal psychologist Paul Britton suggested the culprit would be aged between 14 and 25 and have a good knowledge of the area. |- | December 1992 || Johanna Young || Watton, Norfolk || On 23 December, 14-year-old Johanna left her home in Merton Road, Watton, at around 7:30pm and was seen outside her local fish and chip shop half an hour later. The alarm was raised the following morning when she failed to turn up for her paper round and, on Boxing Day, her body was found in a freezing pond near her home and clothes and shoes discarded nearby. |- | December 1992 || Steven Clark || Body not found || Steven Clark, who was 23 and had disabilities due to injuries sustained in a road accident during childhood, was for many years thought to have last been seen in Saltburn (a small town on the North Yorkshire coast) on 28 December at around 3pm, but in September 2020 a woman contacted the police to say she'd walked past him near his Marske home 45 minutes or so later. (Marske is about two miles away from Saltburn.) This new piece of information followed the revelation that Steven's parents had recently been arrested on suspicion of his murder before being bailed. Both strongly deny being behind his disappearance. |- | 2 January 1993 || Benji Stanley || Moss Side, Manchester || 14-year-old Benji Stanley was shot dead whilst in a takeaway with a friend. Though police found no evidence to support rumours that he had been involved in the trading of illegal drugs, they did reveal that they believed the murderer might have mistaken him for a drug dealer, and in 2011 disclosed the name of a dealer they thought likely to have been the intended target \u2013 someone similar in appearance to Benji at the time of the killing. Another theory is that the intended target was the friend of Benji's who was with him in the takeaway that day. (Benji was on the other boy's bike and had his jacket on when the gunman struck.) |- | 21 January 1993 || Arthur Brumhill || Northampton, Northamptonshire || 76-year-old Arthur Brumhill's body was found in the basement of the pet and garden centre on Wellingborough Road, where he worked part time, by a fellow employee. He had died from several blows to the head inflicted by a blunt metal object, thought to be a tyre iron missing from the scene. The killer is suspected to have escaped out of an upstairs window with a small amount of money taken. An eyewitness described seeing Arthur with another man in his teens with \"mousey- brown\" hair, standing at about 5 ft 5 in tall, in the shop on the evening of the murder. Despite the case appearing on Crimewatch and several arrests being made the case remains unsolved to this day. On 21 January 2013, the 20th anniversary of the murder, police announced they were reviewing the case and hoped that advances in forensic analysis and DNA profiling would bring the killer to justice. |- |24 January 1993 |Stacey Queripel |Bracknell, Berkshire |The body of seven-year-old Stacey Queripel was found in woodland by South Hill Park on the night of 24 January 1993. She had been strangled with her necklace. It's believed she was murdered elsewhere because her shoes were clean but the ground where she was found was muddy. Stacey's mother, Gilliane Queripel, was arrested in connection with her daughter's murder but she was released without charge. |- | February 1993 || Doris Shelley || Attacked in Martlesham, Suffolk; died at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge || Concerned for her welfare because she hadn't answered the door to a woman attempting to deliver shopping to her, a neighbour took the decision to enter Mrs Shelley's bungalow by breaking a lounge window. Inside, he found the 82-year-old cowering in her kitchen. A blunt instrument had been used to strike her head with considerable force, and she died in hospital ten days later, on 21 February. |- |March 1993 |Richard Miles |Stonehouse, Gloucestershire |The panel beater's mother found his body in their back garden during the afternoon of 10 March. In an apparently motiveless killing, he had suffered a single stab wound to the heart sometime after having arrived home for lunch from his workplace that day. Three men arrested in 2013 in connection with the murder \u2013 two on suspicion of being his killers, the third on suspicion of perverting the course of justice \u2013 all ended up being released without charge. |- |March 1993 |Carol Clark |Sharpness, Gloucestershire |32-year-old Carol Clark was last seen in Montpelier, Bristol, on 26 March 1993. Her body was found two days later, thirty miles away at Sharpness docks. She had been strangled and her body was partially clothed. Carol had been a sex worker and her murder was featured on the BBC programme Crimewatch in summer 1993. Among those questioned in connection with Carol's murder were convicted killers Alun Kyte and Philip John Smith. |- | March 1993 || Jean Bradley || Acton, London || Stabbed to death in Carbery Avenue. The victim was a 47-year-old businesswoman. A man was charged, but due to insufficient evidence the case against him was dropped. |- |April 1993 |Karen McGregor |Glasgow |Karen McGregor, 29, was murdered on 18 April 1993 and her body was found hidden in the Scottish Exhibition Centre car park, Glasgow, days later. In 1994, Karen's husband, Charles, stood trial for her murder but the charge was found not proven. Karen was a sex worker and a link has been suggested between her death and the unsolved murders of other sex workers in Glasgow in the 1990s. |- |- |July 1993 |Amanda Duncan |Body not found |Although the body of 26-year-old Amanda Duncan has never been found, police are treating her disappearance as a murder enquiry. Amanda worked as a sex worker and was last seen in the Portman Road area of Ipswich on 2 July 1993. In 2018, on the 25th anniversary of Amanda's disappearance, Suffolk Constabulary made a new appeal for information. |- | July 1993 || Harry and Megan Tooze || Llanharry, South Wales || Shot at point blank range in their home at Ty Ar y Waun Farm. Jonathan Jones, the boyfriend of their daughter Cheryl, was convicted of their murder, but the verdict was quickly overturned on appeal. Since then South Wales Police have made several attempts to solve the murder, but no further arrests have been made. |- | November 1993 || Karen Hales || Ipswich, Suffolk || 21-year-old Karen Hales was stabbed and her body was set on fire during a vicious attack in her own home on Sunday 21 November. The attack was almost certainly witnessed by Karen's 19-month-old daughter. |- |December 1993 |Paul Logan |Blue House Farm, Northumberland |On 23 December 1993, Paul Logan's workplace, a takeaway in Consett, received a call from a nearby phone box requesting the delivery of food to a house in the countryside. With no cause to suspect that the call wasn't genuine, the 25-year-old responded to it accordingly, only to be told when he arrived at the address supplied that no one living there had placed any such order that day. He was bludgeoned to death soon after walking away from the house, his body being found by police a few hours later on farmland within its grounds. (The police had been called to the farm because it had come to the knowledge of its owners that Paul's car hadn't left there.) |- |December 1993 |Viv Graham |Wallsend, Tyne and Wear |Viv Graham, 34, was shot dead after leaving a pub on Wallsend High Street on 31 December 1993. He was well known locally as an organised crime figure and reportedly received a death threat shortly before he was murdered. |- |January 1994 |Sarah Lewin |Huddersfield, West Yorkshire |Sarah Lewin, 36, was found bludgeoned at her home in Bradley Boulevard, Sheepridge, Huddersfield, on 14 January 1994. It's believed that Sarah may have known her killer and her murder could have had a connection to her involvement in the supply of amphetamines. Sarah's brothers made a new plea for information in 2018. |- |March 1994 |Trevor Monerville |Stoke Newington, London |26-year-old Trevor Monerville was stabbed by five men on Trumans Road, Stoke Newington, on 19 March 1994. |- |March 1994 |Doreen Morris |Holyhead, Anglesey |Doreen Morris, 64, lived alone with her two dogs in Mill Lane on the outskirts of Holyhead. Her burnt body was found at her home in the early hours of 25 March 1994. A man stood trial for Doreen's murder the following year, but was acquitted by the jury. A new appeal for information was made on Crimewatch in 2010. |- |April 1994 |Karen Reed |Woking, Surrey |Karen Reed, 33, was shot on her doorstep at 31 Willow Way, Woking, at 9:15pm on 30 April 1994 when she answered the door to a man pretending to deliver pizza. The motive for her murder is uncertain although it's been suggested that it was a case of mistaken identity and that Karen's sister, Alison Ponting, was the intended target. Alison's husband had been convicted of murdering two brothers. |- |May 1994 |Dawn Shields |Castleton, Peak District, Derbyshire |19-year-old mother of one Dawn Shields was last seen getting into a car in Broomhall, Sheffield on 14 May.

Her body was found dumped in a field just off the Rainford bypass the following day; she had been strangled and her clothing was missing. In 2019 it was reported that police were investigating a possible link with convicted murderer Christopher Halliwell, who lived nearby and was a taxi driver. Finley was going to see a taxi driver shortly before her murder. It's also been suggested that Julie's murder could be connected with the murders of Linda Donaldson and Maria Christina Requena. |- | August 1994 || Kenneth Brown || Barrow upon Soar, Leicestershire || Originally from the Scottish town of Falkirk, the 56-year-old businessman had suffered a single gunshot wound to the chest when a cleaner discovered his body in an outbuilding in the grounds of his mansion on 26 August.

In the months that followed, although the police investigation into his death revealed him to have been a popular and well-respected individual, TV and newspaper appeals by detectives eager for any information that would move the case forward were not very successful. Despite this, two men in their 40s were arrested in 2014 on suspicion of Mr Ghafoor's murder; they were subsequently released on bail pending further inquiries. |- | November 1994 || Rikki Neave || Peterborough || Six-year-old Rikki's naked body was found in woodland near his home.

Her brother, Syed Fokrul Islam, was charged with her murder but the charges were dropped because of a lack of evidence to secure a conviction. At the time he was an illegal immigrant to the UK and was awaiting possible deportation to Bangladesh. A woman and three other men were charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice but these charges were dropped too. |- |January 1995 |John Kilcoyne |Bristol |Homeless 44-year-old John Kilcoyne had been drinking in a flat with two associates when the police were called to say he had been badly hurt there.

The killer also took money from each victim's flat. |- |September 1995 |Sally Ann John |Body not found |Although Sally's body has never been found, her disappearance began to be treated as a murder investigation in 2014. Sally was 23 and was last seen on Aylesbury Street, Swindon on 8 September. She was a sex worker at the time of her disappearance. Three men were arrested on suspicion of Sally's kidnap and murder but were released. In 2011, during enquiries into the murders of Sian O'Callaghan and Becky Godden-Edwards, it was discovered that convicted killer Christopher Halliwell was a regular client of Sally's.

Police believe that she was strangled with her own chiffon scarf. She had not been seen for three weeks, but had not been listed as missing as her mother thought she was staying with friends. The police investigation uncovered a double life, but an inquest could not say with absolute certainty how she had died due to decomposition of the body. However, because she had been covered with branches and leaves it is classified as an undetected murder. |- | October 1995 || Diane Jones, Shauna Hibbard and Sarah Jane Hibbard || Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales || Diane Jones, 21, died along with her two daughters, Shauna (aged two) and Sarah Jane (aged 13 months), after petrol was poured into their house and set alight by somebody who had torn its front door away.

He had been shot twice. The car dealer had once been in business with one of the three men killed in Rettendon in December 1995, and this prompted investigators to probe whether there was a connection between his murder and the Rettendon ones. A later police statement made it apparent, however, that no evidence of such a connection had been uncovered. |- | June 1996 || Melanie Hall || South Gloucestershire || Melanie Hall, a 25-year-old psychology graduate from Bradford Leigh, Wiltshire, disappeared in June 1996 after a night out in Bath.

Four people were charged with the murder, and it transpired that eight weeks before her death, Katrina had kept watch while her boyfriend and a friend of his burgled a house to feed their drug habits. It also emerged that a great deal of damage was done to the property in the course of the burglary, and that when the woman whose house it was returned to it the next day, she vowed that whoever was responsible would pay for it. She and her brother were among those charged. At the 1997 trial, the other two accused, drug dealers from London (one of whom was the woman's ex-boyfriend), claimed that when the four of them and Katrina were in a house together to try to reach an agreement, the woman and her brother, with Katrina in tow, had left the house and said upon coming back that Katrina was dead, while the woman and her brother claimed it was the drug dealers who had done that. However, her brother did admit to having put the murder weapon down a drain in Peacehaven. The drug dealers were found guilty of murder but their convictions were overturned on appeal in 1999. During the retrial, one of them admitted to a charge of false imprisonment but was freed anyway because of time he had already spent in jail. |- | August 1996 || Caroline Glachan || Renton, West Dunbartonshire || On the evening of Saturday, 24 August 1996, 14-year-old Caroline left the home she shared with her mother in Bonhill, a council estate in the Vale of Leven.

The following morning her severely battered body was found by a drug addict, hidden in shrubbery beside the river. She had been the victim of a seemingly motiveless, violent attack. There was no evidence of a sexual assault. It's been noted that Caroline's murder bears similarities to the murder of Lindsay Rimer in November 1994 and a link with convicted killer Christopher Halliwell has been suggested as well. |- | November 1996 || Damien Nettles || Body not found || The 16-year-old vanished in Cowes on the Isle of Wight.

Police believed the culprit was trying to get information from Carolanne to access her safe. Her Rolex watch and some jewellery were taken but the safe was still locked. Carolanne had previously reported to police that a man was stalking her. A link has been suggested with the murder of Janet Brown 20 miles away in 1995 (see entry for 1995). |- |18 April 1997 |Linda Chandler |Birmingham |Widow Linda Chandler, 46, was stabbed on her doorstep on Fairbourne Avenue, Kingstanding, Birmingham, on 18 April.

Both were treated for severe burns at Stoke Mandeville Hospital and recovered from their injuries, but Emily died of smoke inhalation. It was found that phone lines to the house had been cut prior to the arson attack to prevent calls to the emergency services. On 3 May 2017, on the 20 year anniversary of Emily's death, her mother and brother made a new appeal for information but the case remains unsolved. |- | August 1997 || Patricia Grainger || Sheffield, South Yorkshire || Patricia Grainger, 25, a vulnerable woman with learning difficulties, was found murdered close to her home in Buchanan Road, Parson Cross, in August 1997.

Donna lived with cousins in Middlesbrough and was last seen in April 1998. In 2015 Cleveland Police apologised to Donna's family for how they had handled the investigation. In 2018, a specialist police team was set up to revisit Donna's murder along with the murders of other Middlesbrough women Vicky Glass and Rachel Wilson. In the summer of that year, police excavated a former allotment site near Troon Close in the city as part of a search for Donna. A link has been suggested with convicted killer Christopher Halliwell. |- | 2 May 1998 || Robin Charles Wood || Northolt, West London || Car dealer Robin Charles Wood, 47, was shot dead by someone at his front door on Saturday 2 May 1998. Mr Wood was at home with his partner and 10-year-old son on the Racecourse Estate in Northolt, West London, when there was a knock on the door at around 10:40pm.
