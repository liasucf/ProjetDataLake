Ruins from that time attest to its destruction. The most significant of them is on an extinct volcano and is protected in the Phanom Rung Historical Park. According to inscriptions found, Buriram's ruler recognized the hegemony of the Khmer Empire's emperor. Before the ascent of Bangkok, little was known about Buriram. In the early Bangkok Period, in the early-19th century, the town originally called Muang Pae was renamed Buriram. After administrative reforms in the late 19th century, Buriram was incorporated into Siam as a province. == Administration divisions == There are 18 chumchons (villages) () in Buriram. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
