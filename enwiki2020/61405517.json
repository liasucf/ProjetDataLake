In 1917, Russia experienced two revolutions. In the February Revolution, the empire was overthrown and a provisional government established. In the October Revolution, the provisional government was deposed and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic established. On 6 December 1917, Finland declared its independence, which Russia recognized on 31 December. Finland nevertheless remained in the same state of war with the Central Powers (Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, the German Empire and the Ottoman Empire) as it had been when a part of Russia.Jaakko Uotila, The Finnish Legal System (Suomen lakimiesliiton kustannus, 1966), p. 249. On 15 December, the Russian government signed an armistice with the Central Powers. On 26 January 1918, a workers' uprising sparked the Finnish Civil War and the establishment a few days later of the Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic. Soviet Russia and the Finnish workers' republic signed a treaty of friendship on 1 March 1918. The armistice with the Central Powers had expired on 18 February, but on 3 March Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and made peace with the Central Powers. A Finno-German peace treaty was signed with the government of the conservative Senate of Finland\u2014as opposed to the workers' republic allied with Russia\u2014on 7 March. Germany then sent military assistance to the Finnish government, which defeated the workers' republic by the end of April. A Finno- Bulgarian peace treaty was also signed at Berlin on 21 May 1918.Treaty of Peace and Amity between Bulgaria and Finland, signed at Berlin, 21 May 1918, Oxford Historical Treaties, Oxford Public International Law. ==Terms== The language of the Austro-Hungarian\u2013Finnish peace treaty was German. The signatories were, on the Austro-Hungarian side, Foreign Minister Stephan Buri\u00e1n von Rajecz and Ambassador Kajetan von M\u00e9rey, who had been the Austro- Hungarian negotiator for the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, and, on the Finnish side, Edvard Immanuel Hjelt, who had negotiated the peace treaty with Germany and was envoy and minister plenipotentiary to Germany, and Count Allan Serlachius, interim charg\u00e9 d'affaires to Norway. The treaty consisted of a mere five articles.Texts of the Finland \"Peace\": With Map (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1918), pp. 47\u201348 (German text of treaty with English translation). Both parties to the treaty waived any claims to costs or damages owing to the war. Several separate agreements were also signed the same day in Vienna: a \"politico-legal supplementary treaty to the peace treaty\", a commercial convention to regulate the economic relations and a convention \"concerning certain questions of private law\".Convention between Austria-Hungary and Finland concerning Certain Questions of Private Law supplementary to the Treaty of Peace, signed at Vienna, 29 May 1918, Oxford Historical Treaties, Oxford Public International Law. According to Article 4 of the peace treaty, the treaty governing economic relations would form \"an essential part of this peace treaty\". The German text of the treaty was published in the Neue Freie Presse on 31 May. ==Notes== ==References== Category:World War I treaties Category:Treaties concluded in 1918 Category:Treaties entered into force in 1918 Category:Peace treaties of Austria Category:Peace treaties of Hungary Category:Peace treaties of Finland Category:Aftermath of World War I in Finland Category:Austria\u2013Finland relations Category:Finland\u2013Hungary relations Category:Treaties of Austria- Hungary Category:May 1918 events Category:1918 in Austria-Hungary Category:1918 in Finland ",
