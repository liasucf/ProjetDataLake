In 1988 their work was exhibited at both the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Hirshorn in Washington D.C., and was the subject of a major retrospective accompanied by a significant publication, \"America Starts Here\" at the MIT List Center for the Visual Arts in 2006. The exhibition was organized by curators Bill Arning, then at MIT List Visual Arts Center, and Ian Berry, the Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College, and toured to Austin Museum of Art, Texas, H&R; Block Artspace at the Kansas City Art Institute, and Contemporary Art Center, Cincinnati. Together, Ericson and Ziegler made site-specific installations and objects concerned with mapping trajectories, questioning history, and highlighting the specificity of places and communities. As a collaborative duo, Ericson / Ziegler's work was integral to the emergence of integrated practice and community engagement as vital forms of contemporary art. In the Wall Street Journal review of their 2014 exhibition at Perrotin Gallery in New York, Carol Kino writes: \u201cKate Ericson and Mel Ziegler were ardent pioneers of the art now known as \"social practice.\"\u201d ==Publications== *Stuffed.
