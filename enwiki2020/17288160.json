    "text": "The Smurfs (syndicated as Smurfs' Adventures) is an American-Belgian animated fantasy-comedy children's television series that aired on NBC from 12 September 1981 to 2 December 1989. Produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions, it is based on the Belgian comic series by the same name, created by Belgian cartoonist Peyo (who also served as story supervisor of this adaptation) and aired for 256 episodes with a total of 418 stories, excluding three cliffhanger episodes and seven specials. ==History== In 1976, Stuart R. Ross, an American media and entertainment entrepreneur who saw the Smurfs while traveling in Belgium, entered into an agreement with Editions Dupuis and Peyo, acquiring North American and other rights to the characters, whose original name was \"les Schtroumpfs\". Subsequently, Ross launched the Smurfs in the United States in association with a California company, Wallace Berrie and Co., whose figurines, dolls and other Smurf merchandise became a hugely popular success. NBC President Fred Silverman's daughter, Melissa, had a Smurf doll of her own that he had bought for her at a toy shop while they were visiting Aspen, Colorado. Silverman thought that a series based on the Smurfs might make a good addition to his Saturday-morning lineup. The Saturday morning cartoon The Smurfs, produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions in association with SEPP International S.A. (from 1981 to 1987) and Lafig S.A. (in the years 1988 and 1989), debuted on NBC in 1981. The series became a major success for the network (one of the few hits to emerge from the Fred Silverman era) and one of the most successful and longest running Saturday morning cartoons in television history, spawning seven spin-off television specials on an almost yearly basis. The characters included Papa Smurf, Smurfette, Brainy Smurf, the evil Gargamel, his cat Azrael, and Johan and his friend Peewit. The Smurfs was nominated multiple times for Daytime Emmy Awards and won Outstanding Children's Entertainment Series in 1982\u20131983. By 1989, the show was in its ninth season and had reached the 200-episode threshold, an extreme rarity when most cartoons were gone after two seasons and 22 episodes (it also far exceeded the typical 65-episode run of a first-run syndicated show of the era). In an effort to come up with new ideas to keep the show fresh, NBC changed the format of the show, removing some of the Smurfs from the forest and omitting the Smurf Village. These changes were adopted to a lost-in-time format similar to The Time Tunnel. The show continued through the end of the season, airing the last original episode 2 December 1989 on NBC. ==Episodes== ==Voices and characters== * Charlie Adler as Natural \"Nat\" Smurfling (1985\u20131989) * Jack Angel as Enchanter Homnibus (1982\u20131988) * Marlene Aragon * Bob Arbogast * Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois * Ed Begley, Jr. * Bernard Behrens * Michael Bell as Grouchy Smurf, Handy Smurf, Lazy Smurf, Johan (1982\u20131988), Gargamel (Season 9), additional voices * Gregg Berger * Mel Blanc * Lucille Bliss as Smurfette * Susan Blu as Nanny Smurf (1988), Pansy * Sorrell Booke * Greg Burson * Ruth Buzzi * William Callaway as Clumsy Smurf, Painter Smurf, additional voices * Joey Camen as Natural Smurf (1983\u20131985) * Hamilton Camp as Greedy Smurf, Harmony Smurf, Woody, additional voices * Roger C.

Family Entertainment) released the complete first season on DVD in a two-volume set in 2008. Despite high sales of both sets, no further seasons have been released. Warner Home Video later released a series of three single-disc releases of The Smurfs in 2009, each containing five episodes from the second season. A two-disc DVD was set to be released in 2011 to tie into the theatrical film with 10 episodes culled from the entire run of the series, but included episodes from the second season instead. Another DVD with both Smurfs Christmas specials was released later that year. It is unknown if Warner Archive will release the rest of the show's complete seasons (under the Hanna-Barbera Classics Collection banner or not) on MOD DVD. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- ! colspan=2|DVD title !
