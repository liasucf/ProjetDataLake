Giovanni has been described as \"the most prolific of the Milanese printers in the early 1500s\".Von Habsburg, Maximilian. Catholic and Protestant Translations of the Imitatio Christi, 1425-1650: From Late Medieval Classic to Early Modern Bestseller Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2011. p. 74. His printer's mark was an angel within a rectangle, holding a disc. There are initials at the feet of the angel, and the words \"IO IACOMO E FRAT DE LAGNANO\" circumscribing a blazing sun, in the middle of which is a monogram, I.H.S., under a cross. This mark has also been attributed to one Zanotto from Castelliono.Bellorini, Egidio Note sulle traduzioni italiane delle \"Eroidi\" d'Ovidio, anteriori al rinascimento E. Loescher, 1900. p. 84.
