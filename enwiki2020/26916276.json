B\u00e9la Sz\u00e9kula, also Bela Sekula (1881\u20131966), was a Hungarian philatelist, stamp dealer and forger who lived in Hungary, Switzerland and the USA. ==Early life and family== B\u00e9la Sz\u00e9kula was born in Hungary in 1881. He was the father of the artist Sonia Sekulahttp://www.sonja-sekula.org/timeline.htm and the brother of the stamp dealers Eugen Sekula, Frank Sekula (the Frasek Company) and Geza Sekula (Charles Sekula).\"Sekula Stamp Dealer Poster Labels\", Ed Pieklo, The Cinderella Philatelist, Vol. 59, No. 3 (Whole No. 235) (July 2019), pp. 110-116. ==Career== Sekula is known for his involvement in making forged reprints of the 1919 Animal and Rulers issue of Ethiopia in 1931. In addition, he was involved in producing many other dubious stamp issues by the creation and issuing of local stamps - for example in Lucerne, Switzerland - and by overprinting existing stamps. He was even thought to be behind the production of stamps for the region of Tannu Tuva during 1934-1936. In 1928 and 1929 he was responsible for the auction of large parts of the Ludvig Lindberg collection of Finland.\"The Finland Collection of Ludvig Lindberg and its Dispersal\" by Jeffrey Stone in The London Philatelist, No. 1396, June 2012, Vol. 121. ==Death== Sz\u00e9kula died in 1966. == See also == * Postage stamps and postal history of Ethiopia * Postage stamps and postal history of Tannu Tuva ==References== Category:1881 births Category:1966 deaths Category:Stamp forgers Category:Stamp dealers Category:Philately of Ethiopia Category:Hungarian philatelists ",
