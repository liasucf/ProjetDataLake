    "text": "Hail the Holy Priests of Ernakulam - Angamaly () refers to a series of defending activities by the priests of the Major Archeparchy of Ernakulam- Angamaly, starting roughly from December 2017 and ending in September 2019. The issue first came out as a land scam in December 2017 through social media. Priests from the Major Archdiocese gathered together in the Archbishops house and asked for the details of the land deals of the Major Archeparchy. The Synod of bishops of the Syro-Malabar Church assembled in January 2018 could not effectively deal with the situation. The priests of the diocese were very strong about the deposition of Mar Alencherry from the office of the Major Archbishop. On 22 June 2018, Roman Curia intervened and appointed Bishop Mar Jacob Manathodath as Apostolic Administrator sede plena of the Major Archeparchy of Ernakulam-Angamaly to study the case with an independent agency and submit the report. During this period the priests came up with certain documents indicating that Mar Alencherry has secret bank accounts. Rome withdrew the administrator on 27 June 2019. the Synod of bishops of the Syro- Malabar Church elected Mar Antony Kariyil CMI and appointed as the Vicar of the Major Archbishop for the Major Archeparchy of Ernakulam-Angamaly with the approval of the Holy See. He has been granted the personal title of Archbishop by the Holy See. The auxiliary bishops were given other appointments. ==See also== * Joseph Parecattil *Major Archdiocese of Enakulam - Angamaly ==References== Category:Syro-Malabar Catholic Church ",
