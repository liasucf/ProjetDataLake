    "text": "Lac La Biche-McMurray was a provincial electoral district in Alberta, Canada, mandated to return a single member to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta using first-past-the-post balloting from 1971 to 1986. It replaced the district of Lac La Biche with minimal boundary changes in 1971, and when abolished in 1986, was replaced by Athabasca-Lac La Biche and Fort McMurray. It differed from the current Fort McMurray-Lac La Biche riding in that it included the entire city of Fort McMurray. ==Representation history== {| class=wikitable align=right |+ Members of the Legislative Assembly for Lac La Biche-McMurray |- !Assembly !Years !colspan=\"2\"|Member !Party |- |align=\"center\" colspan=5|See Lac La Biche 1952-1971 |- |rowspan=2|17th |1971\u20131972 || |rowspan=2|Damase Bouvier |Social Credit |- |1972\u20131975 || |Independent |- |18th |1975\u20131979 |rowspan=3 | |Ron Tesolin |rowspan=3|Progressive Conservative |- |19th |1979\u20131982 |rowspan=2|Norm Weiss |- |20th |1982\u20131986 |- |align=\"center\" colspan=5|See Fort McMurray 1986\u20132004 and Athabasca- Lac La Biche 1986\u20131993 |} The riding's first MLA was Dan Bouvier, newly-minted member for Lac La Biche. Elected under the Social Credit banner, he resigned from caucus a year later \"in the interest of [his] constituents\". He did not run again in the 1975 election. The riding was then picked up by the governing Progressive Conservatives, with Ron Tesolin winning by a large margin over four rivals. He served only one term as MLA, but Norm Weiss held the riding for the PCs for two more terms. Lac La Biche-McMurray was then abolished for the 1986 election and replaced with Fort McMurray, where Weiss would go on to serve two more terms, and Athabasca-Lac La Biche, which would be picked up by the New Democrats. ===Boundary History=== {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" !colspan=4|Lac La Biche-McMurray 1970 Boundaries |- !colspan=4|Bordering Districts |- !North !East !West !South |- |N/A |N/A |Lesser Slave Lake, Peace River, Athabasca |Redwater-Andrew, St. Paul, Bonnyville |- |colspan=2 align=center| |colspan=2 align=center| |- !colspan=4|Legal description from |- |colspan=4|\"The boundary whereof is as follows: Commencing at the north-east corner of the Province;
