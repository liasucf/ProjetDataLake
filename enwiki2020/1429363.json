    "text": "The Winnipeg City Council () is the governing body of the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. When the City of Winnipeg amalgamated with surrounding suburbs in 1972 there were 50 part-time councillors. The number of councillors were reduced to 29 part-time councilors in 1977. It was then further reduced to 15 full-time councillors in 1991 when the Government of Manitoba passed Bill 68. It took effect in the 1992 municipal election and has stayed the same for subsequent elections. Members represent wards throughout the city, and are known as councillors. ==Wards== ===Current wards=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=75% |- ! Name !
