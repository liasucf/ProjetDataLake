    "text": "\"Lay Down Sally\" is a song performed by Eric Clapton, and written by Clapton, Marcella Detroit (as Marcy Levy, the diminutive form of her birth name), and George Terry. It appeared on his November 1977 album Slowhand, and reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. ==Background== \"Lay Down Sally\" is a country blues song performed in the style of J. J. Cale. Clapton also attributed other members of his band \u2013 Carl Radle of Oklahoma, George Terry, Jamie Oldaker and others \u2013 as influencing the song. Clapton explained, \"It's as close as I can get, being English, but the band being a Tulsa band, they play like that naturally. You couldn't get them to do an English rock sound, no way. Their idea of a driving beat isn't being loud or anything. It's subtle.\" Billboard Magazine described Clapton's vocal as \"low key but earthy\" and also praised Marcy Levy's backing vocals. The single was a crossover country music hit, reaching No. 26 in April 1978, Clapton's best showing on the Hot Country Songs chart. \"Lay Down Sally\" was a significant part of the soundtrack of the 2013 film August: Osage County, in which the song was played as the intro music and twice more later on. ==Personnel== * Eric Clapton \u2013 electric guitars, vocals * Marcella Detroit (credited as Marcy Levy) \u2013 vocals * Yvonne Elliman \u2013 vocals * George Terry \u2013 electric guitar * Carl Radle \u2013 electric bass * \u2013 electric piano * Jamie Oldaker \u2013 drums * Glyn Johns \u2013 Producer ==Charts and certifications== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !Chart (1977\u201378) !Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australian Singles Chart |57 |- !scope=\"row\"|Canadian Adult Contemporary |1 |- !scope=\"row\"|Canadian CHUM Singles |2 |- !scope=\"row\"|Canadian Country Singles |49 |- !scope=\"row\"|Canadian Singles Chart |3 |- !scope=\"row\"|French Singles Chart |12 |- !scope=\"row\"|Hungarian Singles Chart |2 |- !scope=\"row\"|Italian Singles Chart |38 |- !scope=\"row\"|Japanese Singles Chart |5 |- !scope=\"row\"|New Zealand Singles Chart |16 |- !scope=\"row\"|Swedish Singles Chart |8 |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Singles Chart |39 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Adult Contemporary |25 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Country Songs |26 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Hot 100 |3 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Cashbox Singles |3 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Record World Singles |8 |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Chart (1978) !Rank |- !scope=\"row\"|Canadian Singles Chart |29 |- !scope=\"row\"|Japanese Singles Chart |81 |- !scope=\"row\"|New Zealand Singles Chart |47 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Hot 100 |15 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Cashbox Singles |16 |} ===All-time charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !

Sovine's version reached No. 70 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in the summer of 1978, and was the last charting single released in his lifetime. Melanie covered this song on her 1983 album Seventh Wave, which was released only in the United Kingdom and Germany. The Seldom Scene, especially banjo player Ben Eldridge, are known for their cover of this song. Jerry Garcia Band covered the song extensively from 1990 to 1995. Marcella Detroit, co-writer of the song, has covered the song twice, first as a B-side to her 1994 single \"I'm No Angel\", in which it is sung in a much slower tempo than the original, and secondly on her 2006 album The Upside of Being Down, in a version more similar to the original. Don Williams covered the song on 1995's album of Borrowed Tales. Asleep at the Wheel covered the song on their 1995 album The Wheel Keeps on Rollin'. Their version peaked at number 70 on the RPM Country Tracks chart in Canada in 1996. Rod Stewart recorded a cover version for his 2006's album Still the Same...
