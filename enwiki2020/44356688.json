    "text": "Standards is an album by American jazz reedist Ken Vandermark, which was recorded in 1994 and released on the Quinnah label. ==Background== In the four sessions that produced the record, Vandermark chose from the large number of colleagues with whom he's got ongoing relationships and mix-and-matched them in four new improvising trios with different instrumental combinations. The initial inspiration for the project came for a similar one undertaken by German bassist Peter Kowald and a monthly series of improvisations called \"Head Exam\" at Chicago's HotHouse modelled after Derek Bailey's Company Week, which uses a free format to get people who don't usually play together to collaborate. The first lineup, with longtime partner bassist Kent Kessler and new associate drummer Hamid Drake, would be named later DKV Trio. Vandermark wanted to pair himself with another reed player and he chose NRG Ensemble co- saxophonist Mars Williams and asked Vandermark Quartet drummer Michael Zerang to join them. For the third combination, he is joined by Jim Baker, pianist in Caffeine, and Vandermark Quartet guitarist and violinist Daniel Scanlan. The last trio includes tabletop guitarist Kevin Drumm and percussionist Steve Hunt, third leg of Caffeine and drummer for the NRG Ensemble.Original Liner Notes by John Corbett ==Reception== The Penguin Guide to Jazz states \"Standards is experimental in that it sets Vandermark up as a member of four different trios... Each has something interesting to yield and some of it sounds almost glaringly new and alive.\" ==Track listing== # \"From the Force of the Term\" \u2013 7:02 # \"Spirit of the Staircase\" \u2013 5:27 # \"Out of Mere Impulse\" \u2013 8:52 # \"Variant Reading\" \u2013 7:16 # \"Experimental Trial\" \u2013 6:09 # \"A Sick Man's Dreams\" \u2013 6:26 # \"Year of His Age\" \u2013 5:07 # \"It Is Solved By Walking\" \u2013 3:54 # \"Nostalgia for the Mud\" \u2013 4:12 # \"To Draw Back in Order To Make a Better Jump\" \u2013 4:30 # \"Rage for Speaking\" \u2013 4:45 # \"Word for Word and Letter for Letter\" \u2013 4:42 ==Personnel== *Ken Vandermark \u2013 reeds *Hamid Drake \u2013 trap set, hand drums (tracks 1-3) *Kent Kessler \u2013 bass (tracks 1-3) *Mars Williams \u2013 saxophones (tracks 4-6) *Michael Zerang \u2013 trap set (tracks 4-6) *Jim Baker \u2013 piano, arp synthesizer (tracks 7-9) *Daniel Scanlan \u2013 electric guitar, violin (tracks 7-9) *Kevin Drumm \u2013 electric guitar (tracks 10-12) *Steve Hunt \u2013 trap set (tracks 10-12) ==References== Category:1995 albums Category:Ken Vandermark albums ",
