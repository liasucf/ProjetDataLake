    "text": "The country of Trinidad and Tobago has a high literacy rate, thanks in part to public education being free from ages 5 to 18 and compulsory from the ages of five to sixteen. In addition to public education, there are many faith-based schools and other educational institutions that are either partially funded and thus charge some tuition, or are fully tuition-based. This List of schools in Trinidad and Tobago includes government, assisted and private schools that provide nationally recognized primary and secondary programs. ==Primary schools== ===Assisted schools=== ====Run by Kabir Panth Board==== * Agostini Settlement KPA School * Siparia Road KPA School ====Run by the Anglican Board==== * Anstey Memorial Girls' Anglican School, San Fernando * Arouca Anglican Primary School, Arouca * Barataria Anglican Primary School, Barataria * Brighton Anglican School, La Brea * Cedros Anglican Primary School, Cedros * Coffee Boys' Anglican School, San Fernando * Claxton Bay Junior Anglican School, Claxton Bay * Claxton Bay Senior Anglican School, Claxton Bay * Couva Anglican School, Couva, * Cumana Anglican School, Cumana Village, Toco * Eckel Village Anglican School, Williamsville * Forest Reserve Anglican School, Forest Fyzabad * Good Shepard Anglican Primary School, Tunapuna * Grande Riviere Anglican School, Grande Riviere Village, via Toco * Holy Saviour Curepe Anglican,Curepe * Lambeau Anglican School, Lambeau * Marabella Boys' Anglican School, Marabella * Marabella Girls' Anglican School Marabella * Melville Memorial Girls' Anglican School, Belmont * Morvant Anglican School, Morvant * Pembroke Anglican School, Port of Spain * Point Fortin Anglican School Point Fortin * Richmond Street Boys' Anglican School (Christus Rex), Port-of-Spain * San Fernando Girls' Anglican School, San Fernando * Southern Central Anglican School, Cedros * St. Christopher's Anglican School, Siparia * St. Francis boys Roman Catholic * St Michael's Anglican School, Princes Town * St John's Anglican Primary School, Cipero Road, San Fernando * St. Nicholas Private Primary, Tobago * St. Margaret's Boys' School, Belmont * St. Patrick's Anglican, Mt.
