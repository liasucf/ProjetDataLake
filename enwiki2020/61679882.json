    "text": "Galicia en Com\u00fan () is a left-wing alliance in Galicia formed by Podemos and United Left (EU) as a successor to the En Marea alliance, which after turning into a party broke up from their three constituent parties in early 2019 as a result of political and leadership differences. The alliance has contested the April 2019 and November 2019 Spanish general elections under the En Com\u00fan\u2013Unidas Podemos label (), and it also exists as a sub-group within the Unidas Podemos confederal parliamentary group in the Congress of Deputies. In September 2019, Podemos and EU, together with Renewal\u2013Nationalist Brotherhood, comprised the Grupo Com\u00fan da Esquerda () parliamentary group, and the alliance is scheduled to be renewed ahead of the 2020 Galician regional election. ==History== The political space until then represented under the umbrella of the En Marea party had broken up in January 2019 after internal disputes throughout the two previous years had reached their peak in December 2018, following the election of a new party leadership under Luis Villares which had seen the party's founding partners\u2014Podemos, Renewal\u2013Nationalist Brotherhood (Anova) and United Left (EU)\u2014accusing the former of fraud and vote rigging, prompting their withdrawal from En Marea and their dubbing of it as a \"failed\" political project. Subsequently, Podemos and EU contested the April 2019 general election as an electoral alliance under the \"In Common\u2013United We Can\" label (), which for this election also included Equo and Mareas en Com\u00fan (), a \"phantom\" political organization registered in August 2018\u2014and which evoked the name of the platform that saw En Marea's inception in the July 2016 Vigo assembly\u2014amid the ongoing crisis within the En Marea confluence. After the election, the alliance formed the \"Galicia in Common\" () sub-group within the Unidas Podemos confederal parliamentary group in the Congress of Deputies. Ahead of the November 2019 general election, the alliance was renewed as a Podemos\u2013EU-only coalition, after Equo had left it to run with M\u00e1s Pa\u00eds. The local \"tides\" (mareas)\u2014such as Marea Atl\u00e1ntica and Compostela Aberta\u2014and Anova chose not to participate in either electoral contest, the latter citing difficulties in reaching an agreement for an electoral \"broad front\". In September 2019, after Villares-aligned deputies had left the still-existing En Marea group in the Parliament of Galicia, MPs from Podemos, EU and Anova formed the Grupo Com\u00fan da Esquerda group, which considered itself a successor to the Galician Left Alternative alliance. While it has been pointed out by members that the group would be a key for the constitution of \"a candidacy of rupturist unity\" succeeding the late En Marea coalition ahead of the next Galician election, it was noted that the parliamentary group's name did not advance the denomination of any prospective electoral brand. The alliance was reformed under the Galicia in Common label with Podemos, EU, Anova and the local tides ahead of the 2020 Galician regional election, with the coalition being maintained without significant changes even after the suspension of the election's initial date on 5 April as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its postponement to 12 July. ==Composition== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:left; font-size:97%;\" |- ! colspan=\"2\"| Party !
