Its population in 2001 was 82,782. Its predecessor riding, York\u2014Sunbury, was represented in the House of Commons from 1917 to 1988. The district includes the city of Fredericton, and the towns of Oromocto, and Minto and vicinity. The neighbouring ridings are Miramichi, Beaus\u00e9jour, Fundy Royal, New Brunswick Southwest, and Tobique\u2014Mactaquac. ==Political geography== \"York\u2014Sunbury\" riding was created in 1914 from parts of Sunbury\u2014Queen's and York ridings. Previously, York County was its own riding and Sunbury County was joined with Queens County. The riding was named after York and Sunbury counties of which it was composed. In 1987, York\u2014Sunbury was abolished. Some rural areas in the southern parts of the riding were transferred to Carleton\u2014Charlotte riding, and a largely uninhabited area, moved to Miramichi. The remainder was incorporated into \"Fredericton\" riding. It was renamed \"Fredericton\u2014York\u2014Sunbury\" shortly after the 1988 election. This riding was abolished in 1996 when more rural areas were moved into other districts (particularly Tobique\u2014Mactaquac and New Brunswick Southwest, and a new riding named \"Fredericton\" was created. The Minto and Chipman areas were added to the riding in 2003. As per the 2012 federal electoral redistribution, this riding will lose territory to Miramichi\u2014Grand Lake, New Brunswick Southwest and Tobique\u2014Mactaquac, and gain a small territory from New Brunswick Southwest. In the 2008 election, the Conservatives gained this seat from the Liberals. The Conservatives were strongest in the rural parts of this riding, outside of Fredericton proper.
