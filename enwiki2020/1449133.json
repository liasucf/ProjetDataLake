Although it was called the Beiyi Freeway (Chinese abbreviation for Taipei to Yilan) prior to its final completion in June 2006, the official name is the Chiang Wei-shui Memorial Freeway, after the early twentieth century Taiwanese political activist and Yilan native Chiang Wei-shui.Taipei Times - archives ==Major cities along the route== *Taipei City *New Taipei City (although this route passes through the mountainous area) *Yilan City ==Intersections with other freeways and expressways== *National freeway 3 at Nangang JCT. in Taipei City ==Lanes== The lanes in each direction are listed below. *2 lanes: **Nangang Junction \u2013 Su-ao Interchange ==Traffic rules== The speed limit in the Hsuehshan Tunnel section is 90 km/h.

It will be constructed between Su-ao, Yilan and Ji-an, Hualien. It may cost over 100 billion New Taiwan dollars to build. Due to environmental protection issues, this project is temporarily suspended. The next item will be Hua-dong Freeway and South Link Freeway. ===A re-alignment of Su-Hua Highway=== In 2008, a realignment of the Su-Hua Highway was suggested, which was named \"Suhuati.\" It would be between Nan-ao, Yilan and Heping, Hualien, and would cost approximately billion to build.
