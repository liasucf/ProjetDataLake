He is currently an auto racer. ==Biography== Ghedina was born in Cortina d'Ampezzo in the province of Belluno, and his mother tongue is Ladin. He studied in Innsbruck and made his World Cup debut in 1989. The following year, after a series of initial podiums and a ruinous fall, he won the last two downhills of the season. He won the silver medal in the Combined race of the 1991 World Championships at Saalbach, Austria; however, the following year he suffered a serious car crash. Ghedina returned to his best form only in 1995, remaining among the best specialists in the speed disciplines until 2001, when he obtained the last of his 13 World Cup victories (12 Downhills and one Super-G, with a total of 33 podiums).Ski- db.com \u2013 Kristian Ghedina \u2013 accessed 9 March 2010 He won also another silver medal at the 1996 and a bronze in the 1997 championships, both in downhill.

His probably most remarkable performance he gave on 24 January 2004 at the Hahnenkamm race in Kitzb\u00fchel: on the last jump, approaching the finish line at a speed of 137,6 km/h, he produced a straddle in the air (\"spread eagle\") which amazed spectators and TV commentators; nevertheless he gained a temporary lead in the race, which he finished sixth in the end.shown on YouTube-Videos - one in German followed by an interview, the other one in French Ghedina retired from ski racing following the 2006 season.
