    "text": "Iamsound Records is a Los Angeles, California-based independent label, which was founded in 2006 by Niki Roberton, as a part of Worlds End, United States (one of the largest US talent management companies for producers). Roberton continues to run the label, with Paul Tao. While the label endeavours to promote local indie music, with Los Angeles-based acts (e.g. Lord Huron, Io Echo and Fool's Gold), its pre-eminent signings include English artists Florence and the Machine, Little Boots and Charli XCX. In 2010, the label released a series of vinyl and digital singles called the L.A. Collection, featuring notable Los Angeles-based musicians through a singles club, although not in the same subscription-only singles club sense that Sub Pop Records used to have. In 2012, Iamsound collaborated with the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art for a gallery/concert series. ==Artists== These include:Iamsound Records | Artists * Banks * Bird Dog * The Black Ghosts * Bleeding Knees Club * Charli XCX * CocknBullKid * Cut Off Your Hands * Florence and the Machine * Fool's Gold * Get Shakes * Io Echo * Kate Boy * Nikki Lane * Little Boots * Lord Huron * MEN * Ms Mr * NewVillager * Salem * Suckers * Sunny Day Sets Fire * Telepathe * KLOE ==See also== * List of record labels: I\u2013Q ==References== ==External links== * Category:American independent record labels Category:Record labels established in 2006 Category:Indie rock record labels Category:Indie pop record labels ",
