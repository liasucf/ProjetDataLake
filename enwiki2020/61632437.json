He contributed to development of railway, road, hydrological and energy infrastructure, mostly in Catalonia, though also in other regions of Spain and in Argentina. Politically he supported the Traditionalist cause. Prior to 1919 and after 1931 he remained active in the Carlist ranks; in 1917-1919 he was member of the regional Catalan party executive. In the 1920s he headed regional Catalan structures of the breakaway Traditionalist grouping known as the Mellistas. ==Family and youth== Joaquina de Verduna The landowner Mas family has been for centuries related to Osona. Teodoro's great-grandfather, Teodoro de Mas Sol\u00e1 (1774-1816), distinguished himself commanding anti-French insurgency during the Peninsular War.New Catholic Encyclopedia, vol. 2, Washington 2003, , p. 429 However, he is better known as husband of Joaquina de Verduna, Teodoro's great-grandmother; already a widow, in 1825 she founded the Carmelite charity order and was declared saint in 1959.Gran Enciclopedia Rialp, vol. 13, Madrid 1981, p. 478 Their son and Teodoro's grandfather, Joaqu\u00edn Jos\u00e9 de Mas y de Vedruna (1801-1873), sided with the legitimists during the First Carlist War and then went on exile.

Nothing is known of his early education. As a 14-year-old he escaped from home to join the legitimists during the Third Carlist War; twice rejected due to his age, he was eventually admitted to Real Cuerpo de Ingenieros; the structure was commanded by his own father.Mas\u2019 possessions were embargoed in 1867, which suggests that already at the time he was considered a potential rebel, El Pensamiento Espa\u00f1ol 02.09.67, available here.

He practiced in civil engineering, though he tried his hand at many sub-disciplines: railways, roads, hydro technical works, power generation and industrial facilities. He was first noted as engaged in construction works in 1884, the last such note comes from the 1910s. His projects focused mostly on Catalonia, though he was recorded also in Le\u00f3n, La Mancha and in Argentina. A hagiographic note maintains that some of his endeavors were unsuccessful due to factors beyond his control;El Correo Espa\u00f1ol 10.08.16, available here no independent source is available to confirm this claim. The field which attracted most of Mas\u2019 attention was hydro technical projects. Most of these works were focused on Catalonia; the only exception were the 1880s works at Saltos del Duero in the province of Salamanca.Galer\u00eda de vicenses ca\u00eddos por Dios y por Espa\u00f1a. D. Teodoro de Mas, [in:] Ausona 248 (1946), p. 2 At unspecified time he engaged in a project related to the Monellots fonts, located near Vich;Tornafoch 2003, p. 408 since the 1860s works supposed to use it as supply of water for domestic Vich usage were dragging on.Francesc Roma i Casanovas, Canvi social i conflictivitat als segles XVIII i XIX.

In 1901 Mas was granted a license to exploit waters of the Ter river, flowing through the Northern Catalonia;El Heraldo Toledano 12.10.06, available here the business ran into difficulties, was re-defined commerciallyEl Ingeniero 522 (1906), available here and continued at least into the early 1910s.El Norte 29.07.10, available here It was the most successful of Mas\u2019 projects; on his own real estate Mol\u00ed de Sau he constructed a hydro power plant;Tornafoch 2003, p. 408 using 15,000 V lines and on a distance of some 13 km it delivered electricity to Vich, where power was further distributed for domestic use via 500 V lines.Francesc de Rocafiguera i Garc\u00eda, Nomenclator. Els noms dels carrers de Vic, Vic 2012, p. 151 Railway transport kept Mas busy from the 1880s to the 1900s. Already in 1884 he was recorded as engaged in development of local network in the province of Salamanca, though no details are available.Tornafoch 2003, p. 408 In the late 1880s he contributed to buildup of railway infrastructure in the Argentinean province of Corrientes,Rocafiguera i Garc\u00eda 2012, p. 151 vaguely noted as engrossed with \u201cvarios ferrocarriles\u201d.Galer\u00eda de vicenses ca\u00eddos por Dios y por Espa\u00f1a.

Another transport engineering discipline that Mas engaged in was road construction; in the mid-1880s he contributed to development of local network in the province of Albacete.Nuestros m\u00e1rtires: Teodoro de Mas y Nadal (1858-1936), [in:] La Tradici\u00f3 de Catalunya service 07.08.18, available here Last but not least, he was engaged in construction of other industrial facilities; he is credited for design and construction of a La F\u00e9 ceramics factory in Buenos Aires.El Correo Espa\u00f1ol 10.08.16, available here ==Politician: from inactivity to Carlist regional executive== Following the juvenile wartime episode in the Carlist ranks Teodoro Mas for decades remained only moderately engaged in Traditionalist politics.

One scholar counts him among most prestigious party men in Osona county, yet he provides no details and suggests that their activity was mostly about adhering to Catholic rituals and observing traditional social routine.Tornafoch 2003, p. 89 Mas assumed more active stance in the mid-1910s, noted in the press as taking part in local county ralliesEl Norte 18.10.16, available here and contributing few pieces to the party press.La Tradici\u00f3n 11.11.16, available here In 1916 de Cerralbo, in agreement with the regional jef\u00e9 Junyent and the provincial one Duque de Solferino, nominated Mas the leader of the comarcal party structures in Vich.El Correo Espa\u00f1ol 10.08.16, available here Following shakeup in the regional executive and resignation of Junyent, in 1917 Mas entered the Catalan Junta Regional, this time led by Solferino.Tierra Hidalga 27.01.17, available here Carlist standard The late 1910s was the period of Mas\u2019 most active stand.

The entire Junta Regional resigned in corporeEl Restaurador 13.03.19, available here and Mas declared his access to the new Partido Cat\u00f3lico Tradicionalista.

Initially Mas did not renounce loyalty to the Carlist dynasty altogether; in September 1919 he presided over a Mellista session with a portrait of Carlos VII on the wall, El Restaurador 30.09.19, available here In 1920-1921 he engaged in buildup of new structures and mobilization of public support; as \u201cpatriarca del tradicionalismo catalan\u201d he headed rallies either in BarcelonaEl Norte 12.05.20, available here or elsewhere,the program aimed for \u201cdemocracia y monarqu\u00eda cristianas\u201d, which would lead to \u201crestauraci\u00f3n completa del cristianismo\u201d and prosperity of the country, Juan Ram\u00f3n de Andr\u00e9s Mart\u00edn, El cisma mellista.

Anyway, he seemed definitely in support of a right-wing alliance, El Debate 21.06.22, available here In late 1922 Mas was co-presidingAndr\u00e9s Mart\u00edn 2000, p. 238 over the grand Mellista assembly in Zaragoza;Correo de Tortosa 12.10.22, available at Xacpremsa service it was entirely controlled by Pradera. Structures of the new party failed to materialize before the 1923 coup of Primo de Rivera. Shortly afterwards Mas issued a manifiesto; it saluted \u201cpatri\u00f3tico movimiento que el ejercito espa\u00f1ol acaba de hacer\u201d, declared total adhesion of the Catalan Mellistas, and noted that the new regime should not only do away with the corrupt system, but its next step should be implementation of Traditionalist principles. The document played down dynastic issues and noted that any king adhering to Traditionalist doctrine would be legitimate.El Debate 18.09.23, available here In 1923-1924 he kept supporting the new regime,Tornafoch 2003, p. 251 e.g. heading \u201cafirmaci\u00f3n patri\u00f3tico-tradicionalista\u201d in Vich;La Cruz 03.07.24, available here however, his position changed.in a July 1924 article in the Mellista-controlled local Traditionalist weekly Ausetania, Mas wrote: \"el general Primo de Rivera cree ser el mejor camino la creaci\u00f3n de un instrumento, con el nombre de Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica, en cuyas manos pueda poner la gobernaci\u00f3n del Estado para restituir al ej\u00e9rcito a sus cuarteles \u00bfQu\u00e9 actitud hemos de seguir los tradicionalistas?

In mid-1937 he was arrested for his presumed engagement in May Days of Barcelona and spent a few months in prison, until he was set free in 1938. In 1939 he fled to France, was active in Resistance, and after 1945 took part in warfare in Indochina and Algeria. In the late 1950s he settled in Chile.
