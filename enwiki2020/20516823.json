It is native to the western United States from California to Utah, where it grows in meadow bottoms and areas with saline soils such as dry or ephemeral lakes. ==Description== This is an annual herb with a mainly erect branching green stem growing up to 40 centimeters tall. The distinctive leaves are fleshy and diamond or arrowhead- shaped and 1 to 4 centimeters long. The plant is generally monoecious, although some individuals bear only female flowers. Male and female flowers appear in the leaf axils, and the male flowers are sometimes borne in spikelike inflorescences. The female flower clusters are enclosed in bracteoles which may be up to 2 centimeters long and resemble the leaves. ==External links== *Jepson Manual Treatment *USDA Plants Profile *Flora of North America *Photo gallery phyllostegia Category:Flora of California Category:Flora of Nevada Category:Flora of Utah Category:Flora of the California desert regions Category:Flora of the Great Basin Category:Flora of the Sonoran Deserts Category:Natural history of the Central Valley (California) Category:Natural history of the Mojave Desert Category:Plants described in 1871 ",
