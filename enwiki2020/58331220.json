    "text": "The saliva-tongue-1 RNA motif is a conserved RNA structure that was discovered by bioinformatics. saliva-tongue-1 motif RNAs are found in metagenomic sequences isolated from human saliva or on the human tongue. So far (as of 2018), these RNAs have not been detected in a classified organism. saliva- tongue-1 RNAs likely function in trans as small RNAs. ==References== Category:Non-coding RNA ",
