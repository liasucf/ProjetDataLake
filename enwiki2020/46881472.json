    "text": "Gadao's Cave is a rock art site on the United States island of Guam. Located near the village of Inarajan, the cave is the site of a panel of approximately 50 pictographs, painted with a mixture of coral lime and tree sap. The most unusual images are of two human stick figures that appear to be carrying things. It is not known who painted them or when, and what their significance is. The cave was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Guam ==References== Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Guam Category:Rock art of Oceania ",
