    "text": "Maria Moreno (October 22, 1920\\- July 9, 1988) was an American farmworker and labor organizer. She was the first woman farmworker hired to be a union representative. == Early life == Moreno was born Maria Torres Martinez in Karnes City, Texas to migrant workers. Her father Vicente Martinez was an orphan of the Mexican Revolution. Her mother Leonarda Torres was Mescalero Apache. Maria married Luis Moreno at 15. They joined the Dustbowl Migration to California in 1940. Maria and Luis eventually had 12 children: Lillian, Abel, Elida, Elvira, Martha, Joe, Elizabeth, Tito, Yolanda, Eva, Olivia and Alex . == Career == Moreno's activism began in 1958, after a flood destroyed crops and stopped farm work. Farmworkers were denied food assistance and her family nearly starved. In 1959 she was hired as an organizer for the AWOC, becoming the first female farmworker in the U.S. to be hired as a union organizer. In December 1961, funding for the AWOC was suspended by the AFL-CIO. Moreno was elected to plead AWOC's case at the national AFL-CIO convention in Miami Beach, Florida. AWOC was such a small union that it granted only one official delegate, Maria Moreno. Her alternate delegate was Neil Scott, an Okie farmworker. Accompanied by fellow AWOC members Otto Johnson and Violet Rotan, they drove across country to attend the conference, where Maria's impassioned speech convinced the organization to restore the funding. This was an important moment in California Labor history, as the movement remained at least minimally active, with the Filipino chapters of AWOC led by Larry Itliong being the most militant. Although the 1965 grape strike is usually credited to Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta's NFWA (National Farm Workers Association), it was started by the Filipino AWOC members, who were later joined by the NFWA. The two groups merged in 1966, affiliating with the national AFL-CIO. > There would not have been the Chavez movement, at least in the form that it > eventually assumed, if it hadn't been for the survival of AWOC.

We made a difference. In spite of this success, Moreno's position was terminated by the new management of the AWOC and the family moved to the Arizona desert, where Maria began her work as a Pentecostal preacher. In 1965, the League of Mexican Women presented Maria Moreno with an Achievement Award at their annual awards banquet. Maria later moved to the Arizona-Mexico border and built a mission that ministered to the poor. She died of breast cancer in 1989. == References == == External links == * Interview with Maria Moreno by Ernest Lowe * Henry P. Anderson Farm worker organization history *Joan London & Henry P.
