    "text": "Now is a studio album by The Dubliners released in 1975. Following the departure of both Ciar\u00e1n Bourke and Ronnie Drew in 1974, singer/guitarist Jim McCann joined Barney McKenna, Luke Kelly and John Sheahan as a member of The Dubliners to record this album, which Sheahan himself produced. The slight shift in personnel produced a more mellow sound. Arguably, McCann's greatest contribution to the album is the ballad \"Carrickfergus\", which became one of his most popular and requested songs. It also features a wonderful rendition of the English ballad, \"The Unquiet Grave\", performed by Luke Kelly. ==Track listing== Side One: # \"Farewell to Carlingford\" # \"The Old Triangle\" # \"The Beggarman\" # \"Matt Hyland\" # \"The Downfall of Paris\" # \"Carrickfergus\" Side Two: # \"Lord of the Dance\" # \"The Lifeboat Mona\" # \"Farewell to Ireland\" # \"The Unquiet Grave\" # \"Lord Inchiquin\" # \"The Lark in the Morning\" Category:The Dubliners albums Category:1975 albums Category:Polydor Records albums ",
