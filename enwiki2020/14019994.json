    "text": "The South West Wales Integrated Transport Consortium is an alliance of four unitary authorities in south west Wales: Pembrokeshire, Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Carmarthenshire. It is one of four transport consortia [SEWTA, SWWITCH, Taith Joint Board and TraCC] supported by the Welsh Assembly Government. ==Ministerial Advisory Group \"Phase Two Report on Transport\" (July 2009)== The future of SWWITCH and the other Regional Transport Consortiums in Wales was called into question by the Ministerial Advisory Group Report of July 2009. This Group, appointed by and reporting to the Deputy First Minister and Transport Minister Ieuan Wyn Jones stated that \"The organisational arrangements for transport are unnecessarily complicated and the regional transport consortia represent an unnecessary tier in the structure.\" (Report summary).(http://wales.gov.uk/docs/det/publications/090715ministerialadvisorygroupphase2reportontransport.pdf). The report was not accepted initially but operational funding was withdrawn from the regional transport consortiums effective April 2014. All public transport functions reverted to the county authorities. ==References== Category:Transport in Carmarthenshire Category:Transport in Neath Port Talbot Category:Transport in Pembrokeshire Category:Transport in Swansea Category:Consortia in the United Kingdom Category:Local government in Wales ",
