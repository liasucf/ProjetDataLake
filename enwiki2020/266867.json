    "text": "Aklan ( Akeanon: Probinsya it Akean [ak'\u0263an]; ; ) is a province in the Philippines located in the Western Visayas region. Its capital is Kalibo. The province is situated in the northwest portion of Panay Island, bordering Antique to the southwest, and Capiz to the east. Aklan faces the Sibuyan Sea and Romblon province to the north. ==History== Aklan is believed to have been settled in the 12th century by settlers from Borneo, ruled by the chieftain Datu Dinagandan which traded with its neighbouring islands. Aklan then became a part of the Kedatuan of Madja-as. Towards the end of the 14th century, Datu Dinagandan moved the capital from what is now Batan. In 1433, Datu Kalantiaw's grandson and successor, Datu Kalantiaw III, was said by Jose Marcos to have formulated a set of laws known today as the Code of Kalantiaw. Well respected scholarly long-term Philippine resident historian William Henry Scott, proved these \"laws\" to be a total fabrication. (archived from the original on 2007-09-15) In 1437, the short-lived dynasty of Datu Kalantiaw ended when Datu Kalantiaw III was killed in battle with the tribes of Datu Manduyog, the legitimate successor of Datu Dinagandan. When Datu Manduyog became the new chieftain, he moved the capital to Bakan (now known as Banga). Several datus succeeded Datu Manduyog until the Spanish explorer Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi landed in Batan in 1565 and claimed the island for Spain, in early Spanish accounts it was called El R\u00edo de Acl\u00e1n. Datu Kabanyag was the chieftain at that period and had his capital in Libacao. In 1942, the Japanese invaded Aklan during World War II and in 1945, combined Filipino and American army along with Aklanon guerrillas liberated Aklan during the war in the Pacific. Aklan became an independent province through Republic Act No. 1414 signed by Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay on April 25, 1956, separating Aklan from Capiz. The original towns were Altavas, Balete, Batan, Banga, Buruanga, Ibajay, Kalibo, Lezo, Libacao, Madalag, Malay, Makato, Malinao, Nabas, New Washington, Numancia, and Tangalan, then all part of the province of Capiz. The province was inaugurated on November 8, 1956. Jos\u00e9 Raz Menez was appointed the first governor of Aklan by President Magsaysay and he served until December 30, 1959. In 1960, Godofredo P. Ramos became the first elected governor but upon resigning to run for Congress he was succeeded by the vice governor, Virgilio S. Patricio. In 1964, Jos\u00e9 B. Legaspi succeeded Patricio and he held office for two consecutive terms from 1964 to 1971.

Inubaran, is a Filipino chicken stew or soup made with chicken cooked with diced banana pith, coconut milk (gata) or coconut cream (kakang gata), a souring agent, lemongrass, and various spices. The souring agent (called aeabihig) is traditionally either batuan fruits (Garcinia morella) or libas leaves (Spondias pinnata). The name means \"[cooked] with ubad (banana pith)\", not to be confused with ubod (palm heart); although ubod can sometimes be used as a substitute for ubad which can be difficult to acquire. Variants of the dish can also be made with other types of meat or seafood. It is a type of ginataan. Binakol, also spelled binakoe, is a Filipino chicken soup made from chicken cooked in coconut water with grated coconut, green papaya (or chayote), leafy vegetables, garlic, onion, ginger, lemongrass, and patis (fish sauce). It can also be spiced with chilis. Binakol can also be cooked with other kinds of meat or seafood. It was traditionally cooked inside bamboo tubes or directly on halved coconut shells. ===Festivals=== The province is known for its festivities which includes the Ati-Atihan festival in Kalibo. Originally, the festival was to celebrate the treaty between the Ati and the Malayan tribes who settled in the Island. The Ati live in the mountain regions and the Malay people in the flatlands or close to the water. The festivity begins on the dry season, at which time the Ati come down from the mountains to trade and celebrate with the Malayan tribes. When the Spaniards settled in the region and converted the Malays to their Christian religion, they asked the Malays to celebrate this festivity to coincide with the Feast of the Santo Ni\u00f1o (Holy Child) which is usually held during the third week of January. Bariw Festival is a unique festival showcasing the skills of every Nabasnon in weaving bags, mats and hats made of bariw leaves \u2013 the prospering livelihood in the municipality. It is highlighted by the dance performance of local talent and ingenuity to the beat of the drums and indigenous rhythm celebrated every May 14 of the year. Bugna Festival is a festival showcasing the different locally produced products and eco-tourism destinations of Tangalan like the marine sanctuary and coral garden, Afga Point, Campo Verde, Jawili Falls, Bughawi beach and reforestation project every May 16 of the year. Kali-Ugyon Festival (kali stands for Kalipayan or happiness and Ugyon meaning \"unity\"). This is the festival celebrated in Libacao every December 30 to January 1, costumed in modern and indigenous outfits bringing people together on the streets for merry-making and to drive away evil spirits in the coming New Year. ===Literature=== Aklanons are known for their literature, which includes the epic of Kalantiao. Certain Aklanons, such as Melchor F. Cichon, Roman Aguirre, have produced several notable literary works in the province. == Ati \u2013 Atihan Festival == The Ati-Atihan Festival is a feast held annually in honor of the Santo Ni\u00f1o (Infant Jesus), held on the third Sunday of January in the town of Kalibo, Aklan, Philippines, on the island of Panay. It originally came from Batan, Aklan, then adopted later by some neighboring towns. The name Ati-Atihan means \"to be like Atis\" or \"to make believe Atis\", the local name for the Aeta aborigines who first settled in Panay Island and other parts of the archipelago. The festival consists of tribal dance, music, accompanied by indigenous costumes and weapons, and parade along the street. Christians and non-Christians observe this day with religious processions. It has inspired many other Philippine Festivals including the Sinulog Festival of Cebu and Dinagyang of Iloilo City, both adaptations of the Kalibo's Ati-Atihan Festival, and legally holds the title \"The Mother of All Philippine Festivals\" in spite of the other two festivals' claims of the same title. The costumes worn at the festival is patterned after the African tribal design like those seen at the Rio Carnaval. A 1200 A.D. event explains the origins of the festival. A group of 10 Malay chieftains called Datus, fleeing from the island of Borneo settled in the Philippines, and were granted settlement by the Ati people, the tribes of Panay Island. Datu Puti made a trade with the natives and bought the plains for a golden salakot, brass basins and bales of cloth. They gave a very long necklace to the wife of the Ati chieftain. Feasting and festivities followed soon after. Some time later, the Ati people were struggling with famine as the result of a bad harvest. They were forced to descend from their mountain village into the settlement below, to seek the generosity of the people who now lived there. The Datus obliged and gave them food. In return, the Ati danced and sang for them, grateful for the gifts they had been given. The festivity was originally a pagan festival from this tribe practicing Animism, and their worshiping their anito god. Spanish missionaries gradually added a Christian meaning. Today, the Ati-Atihan is celebrated as a religious festival. In 2012, the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) and the ICHCAP of UNESCO published Pinagmulan: Enumeration from the Philippine Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage. The first edition of the UNESCO-backed book included the Ati-atihan Festival, signifying its great importance to Philippine intangible cultural heritage. The local government of Aklan, in cooperation with the NCCA, is given the right to nominate the Ati- atihan Festival in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. The people attend masses for the Santo Ni\u00f1o, and benefit dances sponsored by government organizations. The formal opening mass emphasizes the festival\u2019s religious event. The procession begins with a rhythmic drumbeats, and dances parading along the street. The second day begins at dawn with a rosary procession, which ends with a community mass, and procession. The phrase \"Hala Bira! Pwera Pasma!\" is originally associated with the Sto. Nino Ati-Atihan Festival as the revelers and devotees keep on going with the festivities all over the town from morning to the wee hours of the next morning, rain or shine, for one week or even more. They believe that the miraculous Child Jesus will protect them from harm and illness. The highlight of the festival occurs on the last day, the third Sunday of January, when groups representing different tribes compete for tourists' attention and prizes. The festival ends with a procession of thousands of people carrying torches and different kinds of images of the Santo Ni\u00f1o. The contest winners are announced at a masquerade ball which officially ends the festival. ==Universities and colleges== Aklan is the home of the Regional Science High School for Region VI (RSHS-VI), one of the specialized system of public secondary schools in the Philippines. * Aklan Catholic College \u2014 Andagao * Aklan Catholic College \u2014 Kalibo Poblacion * Aklan Polytechnic College \u2014 Kalibo * Aklan Polytechnic College \u2014 New Washington * Aklan State University \u2014 Banga (Main) * Aklan State University \u2014 Ibajay * Aklan State University \u2014 Kalibo * Aklan State University \u2014 Makato * Aklan State University \u2014 New Washington * Altavas Colleges * Balete Community College * Batan Community College * Canadian Tourism & Hospitality Institute \u2014 Boracay * Carillo Culinary Arts and Skills Development Center * Central Panay College of Science and Technology * FEATI University \u2014 Kalibo * Garcia College of Technology-Annex * Garcia College of Technology-Capitol Site * Madyaas Institute * Numancia Integrated School (NIS) * JAVTES College \u2014 Kalibo * Lezo Technical College * Montfort Technical Institute * New OFW Vocational and Technical School * Northwestern Visayan Colleges * Numancia National School of Fisheries * Panay Technological College * Provincial Academic Center College of Nursing * Saint Gabriel College * Saint Anne Business School * STI College of Kalibo * Santo Ni\u00f1o Seminary * Verde Grande Culinary School * Western Pacific College Flora and FaunaPhilippine spotted deer Several species endemic to the Philippines are found in the province.
