The present building was built in 1784 but underwent a reconstruction in 1836, as evidenced by the inscription on the north portal. Between 1961-1963 there was the complete restoration of the iconostasis. Some restoration works were carried out in 1972. ==See also== *Roman Catholicism in Serbia Internal view ==References== Category:Eastern Catholic cathedrals in Serbia Category:Ruski Krstur Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1784 Category:Cultural Monuments of Great Importance (Serbia) ",
