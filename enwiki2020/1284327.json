(born November 7, 1974) is a former Major League Baseball starting pitcher. A highly touted prospect, Benson was drafted first overall by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1996. He followed a strong rookie season in 1999 with an even stronger season in 2000, but those would prove to be the two best seasons of his career, as he underwent Tommy John surgery after the 2000 season. He posted three more good seasons from 2004 to 2006 with the Pirates, the New York Mets, and the Baltimore Orioles, but then underwent rotator cuff surgery, after which he was never again an effective Major League pitcher. Benson is also known for his marriage to Anna Benson. ==High school== Benson was born in Superior, Wisconsin.

The presence of Benson, the expected number one selection in the 1996 MLB amateur draft (held that year on the same week as the CWS) helped draw additional attention to the spring series, transforming it into what one then-Clemson sports information official remembered as the \"Media World Series.\" (Benson was, in fact, drafted by the Pirates during the team's trip to Omaha.1996 College World Series Memories - CLEMSON UNIVERSITY OFFICIAL ATHLETIC SITE) Despite his stellar regular season, Benson subsequently dropped two postseason decisions as the Tigers stumbled to a 2-2 CWS record.

Benson beat Nicaragua to open up the games and then Japan, but it was his single loss (11\u20132 to eventual silver medalist Japan) which proved costly.
