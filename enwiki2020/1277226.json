    "text": "Sankaty Head Golf Club is one of the easternmost golf courses in Massachusetts, perched on the edge of Nantucket Island in Siasconset, Massachusetts. The course was designed by Emerson Armstrong and opened in 1923. It is an 18-hole course. It is one of the few examples of world-class links-style golf outside of the UK (see Shinnecock Hills). The Atlantic wraps around 270 degrees of the layout and the famous Sankaty Head Lighthouse looms over the front nine. The current staff includes: Lori Snell as General Manager, Mark Heartfield as Director of Golf, and Dieter Wiedmayer as Head Golf Professional. Sankaty members are a driving force behind the Francis Ouimet Scholarship Fund. They also have successfully sustained one of the few remaining caddy camps in the world, Camp Sankaty Head, which has existed since the late 1930s. Membership is private, but the public can play during the off- season (before Memorial Day and after Labor Day). Famous members include Jack Welch (whose island residence is just off the 4th tee-box), Larry Bossidy, Bob Wright, Harry Fraker, Larry Bossidy, Amos Hostetter, Henry C. Pfaff, and Bill Belichick. On June 4, 2019, the Sankaty Head Golf Club was chosen to be the host site of the USGA's 41st U.S. Mid-Amateur Championship. This will be their first hosted USGA Championship and is planned for Sept. 25\u201330, 2021. == The Caddy Camp == The Sankaty Head Caddy Camp, directed by Dave Hinman, is the last remaining caddy camp in the United States and one of the last in the world. Here 60 caddies, 6 junior staff members, a program director, caddymaster, camp director, assistant camp director, and cook are located between the eleventh and thirteenth fairways on the course. After being picked through an application process, caddies come to this camp from Iowa, Florida, New York, South Carolina, Maine, New Jersey and other states. There are three \"huts\" in the camp, with 20 boys in each. Other buildings in camp include a mess hall, recreational hall, library, laundry shack, staff hut, and the director's hut. While the boys are not caddying, they can enjoy organized team sports of softball, volleyball, football, basketball, and of course, golf. Also in their free time, the boys can enjoy recreational golf, a workout in the weight \"pit\", or a game of ping pong in the rec hall. On Aug. 2, 2011, a fire at the caddy camp erupted during a propane delivery. The fire consumed three buildings and injured the driver of the propane tanker truck. == Course Information == ===Course Statistics=== * Black Tees: 6625 yards - 72.6 rating - 126 slope. * White Tees: 6270 yards - 70.8 rating - 123 slope. * Blue (Men's) Tees: 5580 yards - 67.2 rating - 118 slope. * Blue (Women's) Tees: 5580 yards - 72.5 rating - 119 slope. * Yellow (Men's) Tees: 5270 yards - 65.7 rating - 111 slope. * Yellow (Men's) Tees: 5270 yards - 70.7 rating - 115 slope. * ===Scorecard=== * == See also == * Siasconset Golf Club == References == ==External links== *Official Sankaty Head Golf Club website *Official Sankaty Head Caddie Camp website *Massachusetts Golf Association Member Page *Course Review *When Did Golfing Begin on Nantucket?
