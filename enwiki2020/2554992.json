    "text": "The Logia of Yeshua, by Guy Davenport and Benjamin Urrutia, published by Counterpoint Press, is a compendium of canonical and extracanonical sayings of Jesus that are considered authentic by the authors. The book won critical praise for its scholarship and poetic language. \"Throughout, The Logia of Yeshua freshens familiar New Testament injunctions, encouraging us to think anew about their meanings.\"Washington Post, April 7, 1996. \"Davenport and Urrutia must be applauded for their desire to awaken the reader by offering these new, bare translations of Jesus' sayings.\" Robert Jonas, Shambhala Sun, September 1996, p. 71. The word logia applies to teachings of Jesus used as source materials by the gospel writers in the writing of the canonical gospels. Logia also refers to the logic those teachings imply. ==See also== * Q source ==References== Category:Books about Jesus Category:1996 books ",
