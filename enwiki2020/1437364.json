    "text": "The Diocese of Oxford is a Church of England diocese that forms part of the Province of Canterbury. The diocese is led by the Bishop of Oxford (currently Steven Croft), and the bishop's seat is at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. It contains more church buildings than any other diocese and has more paid clergy than any other except London. ==History== The Diocese of Oxford was created by letters patent from Henry VIII on 1 September 1542,Clergy of the Church of England Database \u2014 Christ Church cathedral: history and description (Accessed 12 January 2016) out of part of the Diocese of Lincoln. Osney Abbey was designated the original cathedral, but in 1545 this was changed to St. Frideswide's which became Christ Church Cathedral. In 1836 the Archdeaconry of Berkshire was transferred from the Diocese of Salisbury to Oxford. This comprises the county of Berkshire and parts of Wiltshire. In 1837 Buckinghamshire was similarly transferred from the then Diocese of Lincoln, to become the Archdeaconry of Buckingham, although this annexation did not take effect until 1845. In 2013 and 2014, the Diocese of Oxford discussed and resolved to undertake some pastoral alterations; the new archdeaconry of Dorchester was created on 1 March 2014.Ridgeway Broadsheet, March 2014 (Accessed 24 May 2014) On 3 March 2014, it was announced that Judy French would become the first Archdeacon of Dorchester from June 2014.Diocese of Oxford \u2013 New archdeacon for Dorchester (Accessed 21 March 2014) ==Bishops== The diocesan Bishop of Oxford is assisted by the area bishops of Dorchester, Buckingham, and Reading. The suffragan See of Buckingham was created in 1914, and was the suffragan bishop for the whole diocese until 1939 when the See of Dorchester was created; the See of Reading was re-created in 1942, after having been 'in abeyance' since 1909. The provincial episcopal visitor (for parishes in the diocese \u2013 among twelve other dioceses in the western part of the Province of Canterbury \u2013 which do not accept the ordination of women as priests) is Jonathan Goodall, Bishop suffragan of Ebbsfleet, who is licensed as an honorary assistant bishop of the diocese in order to facilitate his ministry in the diocese. Several retired bishops resident in or near the diocese are licensed to serve as honorary assistant bishops.: *Since 1996: Keith Arnold, retired Bishop suffragan of Warwick, lives in Olney. *Since 1999: Peter Nott, retired Bishop of Norwich and Bishop suffragan of Taunton, lives in Westcot. *Since 1999: Henry Richmond, retired Bishop suffragan of Repton, lives in Oxford itself. *Since 2001: Bill Down, retired Assistant Bishop of Leicester and Bishop of Bermuda, lives in Witney. *Since 2004: James Johnson (Bishop of St Helena) returned to parish ministry in Northants and Essex before retiring to Bodicote. *Since 2010: Anthony Russell, former Bishop of Ely and area Bishop of Dorchester, lives in Holton. *Since 2010: Henry Scriven, Mission Director for Latin America (CMS) and former Assistant Bishop in Pittsburgh and Suffragan Bishop in Europe, lives in Abingdon-on-Thames and is also licensed in Chichester and Winchester dioceses. *Since 2013: David Jennings, retired former Bishop suffragan of Warrington, lives in Northleach, Gloucestershire and is also licensed in Gloucester diocese. *Since 2013: John Went, former Bishop suffragan of Tewkesbury, lives in Latimer. George Carey (retired Archbishop of Canterbury) lives in the diocese and was an honorary assistant bishop, but resigned his licence following his implication in the Peter Ball abuse case, and Humphrey Southern, former Bishop suffragan of Repton, is the Principal of Ripon College Cuddesdon. ==Current extent== Map of the dioceses of the Church of England showing Oxford Diocese in mauve ===Counties=== The diocese now covers the counties of *Berkshire (118 churches) *Buckinghamshire (152 churches) *Oxfordshire (227 churches) and has *three churches in the county of Bedfordshire *one church in the traditional county of Middlesex *one church in the county of Hampshire ===Episcopal areas=== Since the creation of an area scheme in 1984, the diocese has been divided into three episcopal areas.
