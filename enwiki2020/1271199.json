    "text": "Gweek Village Hall Gweek (, meaning forest village) is a civil parish and village in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is situated approximately three miles (5 km) east of Helston.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 203 Land's End The civil parish was created from part of the parish of Constantine by boundary revision in 1986. The name Gweek is first recorded as Gwyk in 1358 and is derived from the Cornish word gwig, meaning \"forest village\", cognate with the Welsh gwig and Old Breton guic.Weatherhill, Craig (2007) Cornish Place Names and Language. Ammanford: Sigma Press Gweek village has a pub, the Black Swan, and a combined shop and post office. The village is also home to the Cornish Seal Sanctuary. Gweek lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation, with the same status and protection as a National Park. ==History== Gweek is at the head of navigation of the Helford River. It has been a port since Roman times and thrived in the Tudor period, with its own Customs House.Scolding, Bill (2006) Five Walks around Constantine: heritage, landscape, wildlife. Constantine, Kerrier: Constantine Enterprises Company In the 13th century, the townspeople of Helston bought the rights to the port of Gweek.Le. Messurier, B. and Luck, L. (1998) Loe Pool and Mount's Bay. No. 12 in The National Trust Coast of Cornwall series of leaflets During the mining boom, a tin-smelting blowing house operated at the quayside.Barton, D. Bradford (1969) A History of Tin Mining and Smelting in Cornwall; revised edition. Cornwall Books, reprint 1989 ; p. 20 fn In Lewis's Topographical Dictionary of England published in 1848, the village was described as: > GWEEK, a small port, in the hundred of Kerrier, W. division of Cornwall, 3\u00bd > miles (E. by S.) from Helston. The pilchard-fishery is carried on > extensively, 200 boats being employed in taking the fish, which are cured in > the various creeks and coves within the limits of the port. In addition to > the fishery, the chief trade consists in the exportation of copper-ore, > corn, moorstone, and oysters, and the importation of timber, coal, and > limestone. In an August 1880 edition of The Cornishman newspaper, Gweek (along with Porthleven) was described as a prominent seaport, supplying coal, lime, timber, slate, etc to the neighbouring mines and inhabitants. Timber was unloaded from ships at Merthen Hole and floated up-river to Gweek on barges. The western wharf was owned by Mr Basset of Tehidy. ==Musical activities== Gweek has a silver band which performs locally and provides music at some Anglican services in the Gweek Mission Church. The band also organises a yearly \"band week\". This starts with a concert of three local brass bands in a field overlooking the Helford River. Afterwards, there is a pig roast with stalls and entertainment and at the end of the week a clay pigeon shoot. The Cornwall Fiddle Orchestra was formed in 2007 by fiddle player Hudson Swan. He was a member of Scottish band, The Tannahill Weavers but now lives in Cornwall and works as a violin teacher for the Cornwall Music Service. The orchestra rehearses weekly at Helston School. ==Antiquities== The Tolvan Holed Stone The three-cornered Tolvan Holed Stone is an unusual megalith. It is about 800 metres north of Gweek behind Tolvan Cross Farm. ==In literature== Gweek is featured in The Meaning of Liff, a book by Douglas Adams and John Lloyd. A passage in Charles Kingsley's novel Hereward the Wake features Gweek and its neighbouring woods. Kingsley received some of his education at nearby Helston Grammar School. ==References== ==External links== * The Village Website of Gweek Category:Civil parishes in Cornwall Category:Ports and harbours of Cornwall Category:Villages in Cornwall ",
