Rania Aniftos of Billboard mentioned that the song is \"powerful\" and \"glamorous\". Mike Nied of Idolator stated: \"The track signifies a retreat to more comfortable ground after searching for crossover appeal with saccharine releases like \"Player,\" \"Superlove\" and \"Flame.\" Instead, Tinashe hops on a fierce production to drop some brag-heavy verses.\" ==Live performances== Tinashe performed No Drama on Good Morning America on April 6, 2018 and on the Tonight Show on April 12, 2018. ==Credits and personnel== Adapted from Tidal. *Tinashe \u2013 lead vocals, songwriting *Stargate \u2013 songwriting, production *Offset \u2013 songwriting *Jaycen Joshua \u2013 mixing engineering *Maddox Chhim \u2013 engineering assistant *Dave Nakaji \u2013 engineering assistant *Chris Athens \u2013 mastering ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
