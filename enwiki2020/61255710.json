Her crew attempted to run her onshore. She grounded and the waves pushed her on her side. The surf prevented her crew from launching her boats, or rescue attempts from onshore. Still, all but three of her crew saved themselves by coming ashore on pieces of the wreck. Lord Eldon had a valuable cargo of wine on board, besides indigo and sugar to the amount of 80,000 rupees.Madras Paper, 17 December, [1844.] ==Citations and references== Citations References * * Category:1830 ships Category:Age of Sail merchant ships of England Category:Maritime incidents in December 1844 ",
