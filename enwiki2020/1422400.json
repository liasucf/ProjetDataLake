    "text": "Linda Kozlowski (born January 7, 1958) is an American former actress. She was a nominee in 1987 for a Golden Globe Award. She married Australian actor Paul Hogan, after acting together on Crocodile Dundee (1986). ==Early life== Kozlowski was born and raised in a Polish American family in Fairfield, Connecticut, the daughter of Helen E. (n\u00e9e Helena Parniawska) and Stanley M. Kozlowski (n\u00e9 Stanis\u0142aw Koz\u0142owski). She is a 1976 graduate of Fairfield's Andrew Warde High School.(dead link) Kozlowski graduated from the Juilliard School's drama division in 1981. ==Career== Kozlowski debuted in the 1981\u20131982 off-Broadway production How It All Began. She played \"Miss Forsythe\" on Broadway in Death of a Salesman and in 1984 took the same role in the film version of 1985. Her big break came in 1986 when she was cast as the female lead, opposite Paul Hogan, in the Australian film Crocodile Dundee, in which their on-screen chemistry spilled over into a real relationship. In 1987, Kozlowski was nominated for a Golden Globe award in the Best Supporting Actress category for her performance as Sue Charlton. Two years later, she revisited her starring role with Hogan in Crocodile Dundee II. Also in 1988 she starred with Bill Paxton, Tim Curry and Annie Potts in Pass the Ammo and the TV miniseries Favorite Son. Since that time, she has appeared in Almost an Angel in 1990, Backstreet Justice (with Paul Sorvino) and The Neighbor (with Rod Steiger) in 1994, and Village of the Damned in 1995. In 2001, she starred again with Hogan in Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles, the least successful of the trilogy. She has largely left the acting business because of dissatisfaction with the roles she was getting, stating: \"These straight-to- video, schlocky films I was getting were giving me an ulcer, basically because I was the only one on the set that cared about anything... Between that and my biological clock, I decided to give it all away.\" ==Personal life== Kozlowski married Hogan on May 5, 1990, after he divorced his wife Noelene, to whom he had been married twice over the previous 32 years, from 1958 to 1981 and 1982 to 1990. Kozlowski and Hogan have one child, a boy named Chance. Kozlowski had been married once prior to her marriage to Hogan. In October 2013, Kozlowski filed for divorce from Hogan, citing irreconcilable differences, with the divorce finalized in 2014. ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year ! Title ! Role !
