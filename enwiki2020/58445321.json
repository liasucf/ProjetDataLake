Chichua, the longtime girlfriend of Georgian President Giorgi Margvelashvili, married the president on September 10, 2014, while he was in office, thus becoming the country's first lady. Chichua is a make-up artist, but has also worked as an actress and singer. Her single, \"Electrowaves\", was featured on Maestro TV, a Georgian television station. Her film roles have included the 2012 black comedy, Keep Smiling. She also worked for PIK television prior to Margvelashvili's presidency. More recently, Chichua has starred as a judge on Georgia's Got Talent! (Nichieri), the Georgian version of the international Got Talent series, beginning with season 7. Chichua and Margvelashvili were longtime partners for at least four or five years prior to Giorgi Margvelashvili's presidency. However, the couple were not married when Margvelashvili became president in November 2013, leading to speculation on who would serve as the country's new first lady. Nearly a year later, President Margvelashvili and Chichua married on September 10, 2014 in a ceremony held at their home in Dusheti, making her officially First Lady of Georgia. The couple have two sons \u2014 Teimuraz (born February 2, 2015) and Toma (born January 25, 2018). Maka Chichua also had one daughter from a previous relationship, as well as a stepdaughter from Margvelashvili's previous marriage. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1971 births Category:First Ladies and Gentlemen of Georgia (country) Category:Make-up artists Category:Film actresses from Georgia (country) Category:21st-century actresses from Georgia (country) Category:Female singers from Georgia (country) Category:Women from Georgia (country) in politics Category:21st- century women singers ",
