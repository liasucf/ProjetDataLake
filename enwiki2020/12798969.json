Nominated for the Latin Grammy Awards in 2013. ==History== The band was started Erik Canales and Manuel Avila in 2002. They had known each other in high school for reasons other than music, and had individual musical projects before founding Allison, but none of these were successful, so they decided to create Allison along with two former members of a band Erik was in. Erik says he suggested the name after reading a poem about the true meaning of love: \"Allison is the girl you're falling in love with and she with you, but still you don't know her\". In 2003 they met Paco Zepeda, their current manager, and started working on demos and songs to present to some transnational labels. Their manager presented the project to the executives of Sony/BMG and they decided to sign them. From December 2005 to mid-February 2006, their debut album was recorded. The album production was conducted by Armando \u00c1vila, Paco Erick Zepeda and Spartacus; vocal direction was conducted by Guido Laris. At that time, they did not have a drummer, drums were recorded by Roy Ca\u00f1edo, of Thermo. The mastering was conducted by Don Tayler who had previously worked with bands like Korn and Jimmy Eat World. From 2006 to mid-2007 they worked on recording new songs including the special edition of their eponymous debut album \"Allison\", this new edition will appoint \"Allison, Special Edition,\" which follows the sixth single \"Amor Eterno\" a Juan Gabriel cover. In January 2008 the band recorded their second studio album, \"Memorama\" which was put on sale 5 May of that year.

In 2014 Manolin left the band to concentrate on a new musical project Dolores de Huevos. On 1 October they released their third studio album, \"120 Km / hr\", marking their return.
