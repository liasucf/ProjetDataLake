He is one of the most loved Icelandic poets \u2013 not least for his verse for children and how beautifully his words flow in the Icelandic language \u2013 making them ideal for songs. Indeed, his poems have been a constant inspiration for composers, songwriters and musicians in Iceland. More than two hundred songs and compositions have been written based on his poems/lyrics, some even performed by internationally recognised artists such as Bj\u00f6rk here performing the song about The Christmas Cat. One of the salient figures of modern Icelandic poetry, J\u00f3hannes mastered both the intricate traditional forms and the modern, but as an outspoken, idealistic and sometimes scathing critic of political institutions, he courted controversy and often drew the ire of political opponents. J\u00f3hannes began his career as a neo-romantic poet in the 1920s, but later became a leading force among the radical poets of the depression era. After WWII he revolted against the traditional form, renewing his poetry through his originality and artistry. He was a spokesman for peace throughout his life and fought vigorously against Iceland\u2019s occupation by foreign armies. ==Life== J\u00f3hannes was born in 1899 at Goddasta\u00f0ir farmstead, near the head of Hvammsfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur in the Dales of Northwestern Iceland. Despite poverty, J\u00f3hannes was educated and graduated as a primary school teacher in 1921, a profession he practised for more than a decade, first in the countryside and then in Reykjav\u00edk. From then on he worked as an editor and an author, first in Reykjav\u00edk and then in 1940 when he moved to Hverager\u00f0i, a small town in the South of Iceland which became known as the Artists Colony in the 1940s. He moved back to Reykjav\u00edk in 1959 where he lived from then on. ==Works== In 1932, J\u00f3hannes \u00far K\u00f6tlum published his best-loved children's book: J\u00f3lin koma (Christmas is Coming \u2013 Verse for Children). One of the poems in the book, \"The Yuletide-Lads,\" reintroduced Icelandic society to Yuletide folklore and established what is now considered the canonical thirteen Yuletide-lads or Yule Lads, their personalities and connection to other folkloric characters. Since then Christmas is Coming has been an integral part of Icelandic Christmas traditions and helped preserve age-old folklore in modern culture. A seasonal bestseller from the start, few other books have been reprinted as many times in Iceland. ==Awards and nominations== J\u00f3hannes received awards for his celebratory verses in the Parliament Millennium Celebrations of 1930 and the Republic of Iceland Festivities in 1944. He was awarded the Silver Horse, the Icelandic Newspapers Literature Award, in 1970. He was nominated twice for the Nordic Council Literature Prize; in 1966 and 1973. ==Bibliography== ===Poetry=== * 1926: B\u00ed b\u00ed og blaka * 1929: \u00c1lftirnar kvaka, poems * 1932: \u00c9g l\u00e6t sem \u00e9g sofi, poems * 1932: J\u00f3lin koma, poems (for children) - established what is now considered the canonical thirteen Yule Lads * 1933: \u00d6mmus\u00f6gur (for children) * 1935: Samt mun \u00e9g vaka * 1937: Hr\u00edmhvita m\u00f3\u00f0ir * 1939: Hart er \u00ed heimi * 1940: Eil\u00edf\u00f0ar sm\u00e1bl\u00f3m * 1941: Bakkabr\u00e6\u00f0ur (for children) * 1945: S\u00f3l t\u00e9r sortna * 1946: Lj\u00f3\u00f0i\u00f0 um Labbak\u00fat (for children) * 1949: Lj\u00f3\u00f0asafn I-II selected poems * 1952: S\u00f3leyjarkv\u00e6\u00f0i * 1952: Hli\u00f0 hins himneska fri\u00f0ar * 1955: Sj\u00f6d\u00e6gra * 1959: V\u00edsur Ingu D\u00f3ru (for children) * 1962: \u00d3lj\u00f3\u00f0 * 1964: Tregaslagur * 1966: Mannssonurinn * 1970: N\u00fd og ni\u00f0 * 1972-76: Lj\u00f3\u00f0asafn I-VIII, selected poems * 1984: Lj\u00f3\u00f0asafn IX, selected poems * 1987: Saga af Su\u00f0urnesjum (for children) * 1988: Segja vil \u00e9g s\u00f6gu af sveinunum \u00feeim (for children) * 2001: J\u00f3lin okkar (for children) * 2010: Lj\u00f3\u00f0a\u00farval, selected poems ===Novels=== * 1934: Og bj\u00f6rgin klofnu\u00f0u * 1943: Verndarenglarnir * 1949: Dau\u00f0smannsey * 1950: Siglingin mikla * 1951: Frelsis\u00e1lfan ===Stories=== * 1938: Fuglinn segir (for children) ===Essays=== * 1958: Ro\u00f0asteinninn og ritfrelsi\u00f0 * 1965: Vinaspegill === Translations === * 1934: Kak I (with Sigur\u00f0ur Thorlacius) Vilhjalmur Stefansson and Violet Irwin * 1935: Kak II (with Sigur\u00f0ur Thorlacius) Vilhjalmur Stefansson and Violet Irwin * 1935: Mamma litla I (with Sigur\u00f0ur Thorlacius) \u00c9lise de Pressens\u00e9 * 1936: Mamma litla II (with Sigur\u00f0ur Thorlacius) \u00c9lise de Pressens\u00e9 * 1938: Himalajaf\u00f6rin (with Sigur\u00f0ur Thorlacius) Queling * 1946: Salam\u00f6ndrustr\u00ed\u00f0i\u00f0 Karel \u010capek * 1946: Fimm synir Howard Fast * 1948: Annarlegar tungur (various selected poets) * 1955: Saga af s\u00f6nnum manni Boris Nikolaevich Polevo\u012d * 1957: Vegurinn til l\u00edfsins I Anton Semyonovich Makarenko * 1957: Vegurinn til l\u00edfsins II Anton Semyonovich Makarenko * 1958: Fr\u00fa L\u00fana \u00ed sn\u00f6runni Agnar Mykle ==References== ==External links== *J\u00f3hannes Bjarni J\u00f3nasson Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica entry * johannes.is - Ritaskr\u00e1r Kotlum, Johannes ur Kotlum, Johannes ur Category:Icelandic poets Category:Icelandic communists Category:20th-century Icelandic people Johannes ur Kotlum ",
