    "text": "Jawbone is the pseudonym of Bob Zabor, an American blues musician from Detroit. He is particularly unusual in that he is a one-man band. The instruments he plays include the harmonica, the guitar and the tambourine. He deliberately aims for a lo-fi sound, akin to early blues recordings. He appeared on the BBC's John Peel show, and has been included on various magazine CDs there. ==Discography== * Dang Blues (2004 CD, Loose Music * hi- de-hi b/w walter john (7\" Record) * Johnny Cash Tribute CD (free with Mojo magazine, featuring \"Get Rhythm\") * This Is Punk Rock Blues Vol. 1 (Various Artists, CD featuring \"4-11-44\") * Hauling (2006 CD, Loose Music) * Chug a Lug b/w Get Rhythm (7\" Record) == References == ==External links== * Jawbone's website * www.loosemusic.com Category:American street performers Category:American blues harmonica players Category:American blues guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:American blues singers Category:One-man bands Category:Living people Category:Tambourine players Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
