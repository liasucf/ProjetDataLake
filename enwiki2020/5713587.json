    "text": "The National Collegiate Wrestling Association (NCWA) is a nonprofit association of 162 institutions, conferences, organizations and individuals that organize the wrestling programs of many colleges and universities in the United States and Canada. It is led by founder and executive director Jim Giunta headquartered in Dallas, Texas and built to help the promotion of collegiate wrestling. Many teams were formerly NCAA programs displaced by Title IX legislation and/or are preparing to join the NCAA, NAIA, or NJCAA. Teams in transition to a higher division not eligible for the NCAA postseason also compete in the NCWA. Notable wrestling programs to have started or competed in the NCWA and are now in other associations include: California Baptist, McKendree, Notre Dame College, and Southern Illinois Edwardsville. == History == A post-secondary athletic association built to help the promotion of collegiate wrestling, the NCWA was founded in 1997 as a 501c3 non-profit by the current executive director, Jim Giunta, after resigning as executive director of the Texas Interscholastic Wrestling Association (TIWA). At its founding the association had 13 member teams, but today the NCWA is composed of over 150 wrestling teams and clubs from across the United States and Canada. Many of these programs were formerly NCAA scholarship programs which were affected by Title IX legislation, which has resulted in many colleges being forced to give up their wrestling programs in the name of gender equality. The variety of institutions competing in the NCWA is wide and unrestricted as junior colleges, trade schools and post-secondary prep institutions compete in the same national championship as four-year colleges and universities. === NCWA Growth === http://ncwaalumni.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/5/4/12543370/2013_ncwa_media_guide.pdf {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

This is evident with advances such as the GoGreco Program, instant replay and challenges in matches, and the Collegiate Cup championship format. * Talented high school student-athletes who were passed over by NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA schools have a chance to compete at an NCWA program. * Talented high school student-athletes who transferred out of an NCAA/NAIA/NJCAA school have a second chance to wrestle in college. * Some U.S. states do not have NCAA, NAIA, and/or NJCAA teams with wrestling, but do have at least one NCWA wrestling program, which can make it easier for high school athletes to decide where they want to wrestle in college in terms of financial costs. * The NCWA allows student-athletes four total seasons of eligibility with no time frame to complete them unlike the NCAA, who requires student-athletes to complete four seasons of eligibility in five years of enrollment starting from the student's first year at the school, and the NJCAA, requires student-athletes to complete two seasons of eligibility in three years of enrollment starting from the student's first year at the school. === Similarities with NCAA, NAIA, NJCAA, CCCAA, and WCWA === * Collegiate weight classes are used (125, 133, 141, 149, 157, 165, 174, 184, 197, 285 lbs). * All meets and tournaments use NCAA rules and procedures. * All conferences host a Conference Championships tournament with a specific allotment of automatic qualifiers based on placement finish in the Conference Championships. * Like the NAIA, a school can enter two wrestlers in the same weight class at the Conference and National Championships (if they both qualify for the latter); one is deemed the scorer and the other the non-scorer (no advancement, match, or placement points are awarded to this wrestler). * Like the NAIA, the NCWA allows a student-athlete four total seasons of eligibility regardless of time frame. The NCAA require students to complete their four seasons of eligibility in five years starting from the student's first year of competition (barring a sixth-year grant for hardship). Athletes previously competing for an NCAA, NJCAA, or CCCAA program that transfer to the NCWA will still have the remaining number of eligible seasons without the previous time frame. * Like the WCWA, schools traditionally competing in the NCAA, NAIA, NJCAA, or CCCAA can all compete against one another. === Differences with NCAA, NAIA, NJCAA, CCCAA, and WCWA === As mentioned before, the NCWA allows many types of funding to its wrestling programs that might not be allowed by the NCAA. This can allow the wrestling team to grow at its own rate. ==== 235 lb weight class ==== The NCWA is the only association with collegiate wrestling to offer an 11th weight class: 235 lbs. There are a number of benefits from this: * This weight class bridges the weight gap between the 197 lb and 285 lb weight classes, the biggest weight disparity among any two weight classes. * College wrestlers who wrestled in the 195 or 220 lb weight classes in high school might find this easier to compete in than having to wrestle at 197 lbs or 285 lbs. * Schools who have two or more prominent athletes in the 197 and/or 285 lb weight classes can now give their athletes another chance to succeed individually and earn team points. * Another weight class leads to higher team scores at tournaments. * The 11th weight class can often be used as a tiebreaker as the first criterion of \"Number of Matches Won\" in dual meet settings. ==== Collegiate Cup Championship Series ==== Starting in the 2013\u20132014 season, the National Championships in March and the Collegiate Cup Duals (previously known as the National Dual Meet Championship) directly related to each other in a team's point total. A team's finish at the Collegiate Cup Duals transferred to additional points being awarded at the National Championships. The National Wrestling Coaches Association (or \"NWCA\") have a National Duals tournament for NCAA Division I, Division II, Division III, NAIA, NJCAA, and NCWA teams, but all do not tie into their respective National Championships point totals. Penn State University (NCAA D-I) won four straight National Championships from 2011 to 2014 \u2013 without ever competing in the NCAA D-I entry of the National Duals. The NCWA's National Championship Series is the first of any of the college divisions to have a true champion that is indicative of both its team's as well as its individuals' success. ==== GoGreco Program ==== Starting in 2016, the NCWA launched the GoGreco Program with USA Wrestling.https://ncwa.net/news/2017/college-gogreco-season- announced While USA Wrestling's Freestyle and Greco-Roman season and procedures are separate from the wrestling teams and individuals that participate in them, the NCWA owns and operates the GoGreco Program within their domain and directly controls and promotes another wrestling opportunity. This is the first collegiate-level Greco-Roman wrestling national championship. The inaugural championships will take place on June 3, 2017 in Dallas, Texas on the campus of Richland College. The first tournament, the Texas GoGreco Championships, took place on Saturday, May 6, 2017 at Richland College. The University of North Texas won the tournament with six of seven wrestlers winning in the finals. Richland College and University of Houston\u2013Downtown finished second and third, respectively.https://ncwa.net/news/2017/texas-colleges-prepare-for-gogreco- nationals ==== Women's Folkstyle Wrestling ==== Whereas the WCWA has athletes compete in freestyle, the NCWA has its women's division compete in collegiate folkstyle wrestling. There are a number of teams that compete in both the WCWA and NCWA to give their athletes more competitive opportunity. == National Events == The NCWA sponsors nine types national events: # The Champions Challenge # The NCWA National Duals # Regional Duals Championship # Conference Championships # Recruit Me High School Wrestling Combine # National Collegiate Wrestling Championships # The Women's Collegiate Wrestling Championships # GoGreco National Championships # The Vision Forum === Champions Challenge === From 2010\u20132011, the Champions Challenge was formed by the NAIA and NCWA to bring more highlight matches to the wrestling community by pitting NAIA All- Stars against NCWA All-Stars at each weight class in a dual meet (except for 235 lbs since the NAIA does not recognize that weight class in competition). The All-Stars were usually the highest returning All-American at each weight class barring injury; the coaching staffs were one or two coaches for each school represented in the dual. The NCAA Division II is slated to join in the next event. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text- align: center;\" |- !colspan=10|Champions Challenge series history |- ! rowspan=\"2\"|Year ! rowspan=\"2\"|Host city (Host location) ! colspan=4|Dual Meet ! rowspan=\"2\"|Series Record (Streak) |- !Winner !Points !Runner-up !Points |- |2010 |Orlando, Florida (University of Central Florida) |NAIA(1/2) |39 |NCWA |3 |NAIA 1-0 (1-0) |- |2011 |Orlando, Florida (University of Central Florida) |NAIA(2/2) |23 |NCWA |15 |NAIA 2-0 (2-0) |- |} === National Dual Meet Championship === In 2008, the NCWA approved the National Dual Meet Championship where the top teams in the country would compete against one another to crown a true team champion starting in 2009. No other association had an official dual-based team champion at the time and that is still the case except in the NCWA. The current structure has 24 teams competing in a bracketed format down to 24 places. In its thirteenth season, the NCWA hosted its first National Dual Meet Championship. Whereas the National Championships focuses more on individual success and teams can depend on one or a few exceptional wrestlers, the National Duals highlights teams with solid line-ups and good wrestlers at each weight class. It is common for teams that win or place highly in the National Duals to do so at the National Championships later. The National Duals usually take place in late January before the National Championships. Starting in the 2013\u20132014 season, two changes took place: 1) the National Dual Meet Championship was now renamed as the Collegiate Cup Duals and 2) a team's finish at the Collegiate Cup Duals would earn it a certain amount of team points at the National Championships and aid them in winning it. Two major reasons for this change were to 1) encourage more teams to want to wrestle in the Collegiate Cup Duals and, 2) while still recognizing up to two different champions at the two different tournaments, one team could be determined as the best true overall team and individual wrestling champion that year. During the 2017 Vision Forum, the NCWA ruled that the National Dual Meet Championship will be held on the eastern side of the United States during even-numbered years and on the western side of the United States during odd-numbered years. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\" |- !colspan=10|NCWA National Dual Meet Championships series history |- ! rowspan=\"2\"|Year ! rowspan=\"2\"|Host city (Host location) ! colspan=4|Finals match ! rowspan=\"2\"|Notes |- !Winner !Points !Runner-up !Points |- |2009 |Murfreesboro, Tennessee (Middle Tennessee State University) |Grand Valley(1/1)http://www.nationalduals.org/college.htmlhttp://multibriefs.com/briefs/ncwa/NCWA020309.php |33 |Central Florida |18 |Inaugural event. |- |2010 |Shelbyville, Tennessee (Middle Tennessee State University and University of Georgia) |Marion Military(1/1)http://www.nationalduals.org/college.html |27 |Apprentice |15 | |- |2011 |Dalton, Georgia (Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center) |California Baptist (1/1)http://www.ncwa.net/news?news_id=918https://cbulancers.com/news/2011/1/30/SWEET_GEORGIA_CHAMPS.aspx |42 |Central Florida |4 |First team to win event while in transition to another association. |- |2012 |Dalton, Georgia (Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center) |Liberty (1/5)http://themat.com/section.php?section_id=3&page;=showarticle&ArticleID;=24627http://daltondailycitizen.com/sports/x1296872934/Something- gained-Flames-win-title-at-NCWA-National-Duals |25 |Lindenwood |15 | |- |2013 |Dalton, Georgia (Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center) |Lindenwood (1/1)http://www.ncwa.net/news?news_id=1217http://www.lindenwoodlions.com/news/2013/1/19/WREST_0119130858.aspx |30 |Liberty |19 |First time the event was a rematch of the previous year's finals. |- |2014 |Dalton, Georgia (Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center) |Grand Canyon(1/1)http://news.theopenmat.com/college-wrestling-news/grand-canyon- edges-shorter-to-claim-ncwa-collegiate-cup-dual-championship/33909 |23 |Shorter |19 |First time the event became the Collegiate Cup Duals and team points were a factor for the overall Collegiate Cup championship. |- |2015 |Dalton, Georgia (Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center) |Liberty (2/5)http://www.liberty.edu/campusrec/clubsports/index.cfm?PID=25954&NewsID;=960&TeamID;= |37 |Apprentice |9 |First team to win event more than once. |- |2016 |Dalton, Georgia (Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center) |Central Florida (1/1)https://ncwa.net/news/2016/ucf-wins-first-national-duals-title-defeats- grand-valley-state |32 |Grand Valley State |18 | |- |2017 |Lynchburg, Virginia (Liberty University) |Emmanuel (1/1)http://www.teamusa.org/USA- Wrestling/Features/2017/January/28/Emmanuel-wins-NCWA-Duals-title |33 |Liberty |13 | |- |2018 |Lynchburg, Virginia (Liberty University) |Liberty (3/5)https://ncwa.net/news/2018/liberty-tops- emmanuel-30-15-for-duals-title-gvsu-3rd |30 |Emmanuel |15 | |- |2019 |Mesquite, Nevada (CasaBlanca Resort Event Center) |Liberty (4/5)https://arena.flowrestling.org/event/a8e864a1-d3fb-429b-aacc-fa439d69b150 |28 |Apprentice |18 |First school to win back-to-back titles |- |2020 |Lynchburg, Virginia (Liberty University) |Men's: Liberty (5/5)https://arena.flowrestling.org/event/8cfaf5d4-e571-3651-e44a-23a019761d69https://www.liberty.edu/campusrec/clubsports/index.cfm?PID=25954&NewsID;=3222&TeamID;= Women's: Schreiner (1/1)https://arena.flowrestling.org/event/8cfaf5d4-e571-3651-e44a-23a019761d69 |43 48 |Men's: Apprentice Women's: Liberty |13 6 |First ever Women's National Dual Meet Championship |- |} ==== 6:12 Project ==== The 6:12 Project is a community outreach program created by the NCWA for its wrestlers, coaches, officials, volunteers, and staff to help the city hosting the NCWA National Duals. NCWA wrestling programs serve food to those in need and hold canned and non-perishable food drives. They later donate those goods, as well as clothes (especially jackets), to one of the city's organizations. The name \"6:12 Project\" comes from the Biblical quote Ephesians chapter 6, verse 12 from the New Testament: :\"For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against power, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.\" The first 6:12 Project took place at the 2012 National Duals in Dalton, Georgia and repeated for the 2013 and 2014 events which were also held in Dalton. It is scheduled to continue at the 2015 Collegiate Cup Duals in Dalton again. === NCWA Regional Duals Championship === Initially created as the Western Regional Duals, this event was created in order to give teams in the western and central part of North America the opportunity to compete in a national dual meet event like the National Dual Meet Championship. Historically, the National Dual Meet Championship has been hosted on the eastern side of the United States in Georgia, Tennessee, or Virginia. When the Collegiate Cup was passed in 2013, questions and concerns were raised as to whether teams closer to the physical location of the National Dual Meet Championship would have an unfair competitive advantage in terms of championship points calculated for the Collegiate Cup series. At the 2017 Vision Forum, the NCWA passed a resolution stating that in even-numbered years the National Duals would take place on the eastern side and the Regional Duals on the western side; in odd-numbered years, the National Duals would take place at a western location and the Regional Duals an eastern location. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\" |- !colspan=10|Regional Duals Championship series history |- ! rowspan=\"2\"|Year ! rowspan=\"2\"|Host city (Host location) ! colspan=4|Finals match ! rowspan=\"2\"|Notes |- !Winner !Points !Runner-up !Points |- |2017 |St. George, Utah (Dixie State University) |Grays Harbor (1/1)https://ncwa.net/news/2017/2017-ncwa-western-regional-dual-championship- results |33 |Brigham Young |23 |Inaugural event. |- |2018 |Las Vegas, Nevada (Western High School) |Brigham Young(1/1)https://ncwa.net/news/2018/byu-beats- colorado-state-for-first-regional-duals-title |38 | Colorado State |10 |First time a team appeared in consecutive finals matches |- |2019 |Akron, Ohio (Springfield High School) |Mott(1/1) |38 |East Carolina |18 |First Regional Dual Championship to take place in the East |- |2020 |Surprise, Arizona (Ottawa University Surprise) |Nevada - Las Vegas(1/1)https://arena.flowrestling.org/event/367c40a8-7f5b-03e6-e3c5-aad907449b04 |39 |Wayne State |24 |Round-robin format was used |- |} === Conference Championships === Following the inaugural season, the NCWA approved a five-conference format where wrestlers would compete for advancement into the National Championships as well as seeding if they qualified. The number of conferences has fluctuated throughout the years including reaching a record high of 9 and currently set at 8. Additionally, some conferences have been re-named over the years. These conferences are geographically-based and are similar to the National Championships tournament where Division I and II programs wrestle in one bracket, but differ in that team scores are kept as one tournament (unlike the National Championships having a Division I team score and Division II team score). {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\" |- !colspan=2|1998 Conference Champions |- !

Most athletes are high school student-athletes which is the primary focus, however students at a post-secondary institution without a wrestling program may also attend. The event also allows students to ask questions about collegiate competition to college coaches. === Men's Collegiate Wrestling Championships === The first major event the NCWA hosted took place in 1998 was the inaugural National Championships with 26 teams in one division in the 10 then-standard weight classes. Since then, the event has grown to include approximately 340 qualifiers among 150+ teams within the 11 NCWA weight classes where two champions are crowned (Division I and Division II). Here, individuals are recognized for their outstanding individual achievement. They can earn team points (unless they are the non-scorer on their team) by advancing through the tournament, scoring bonus points in matches, and placing in the top 8. Teams accumulate points from all of their scoring wrestlers. The National Championships have traditionally been held in the middle of March. Division I and Division II teams compete in one bracketed tournament where the overall team points are separated at the end between the two. In 1998, the NCWA approved an eleventh weight class, the 235 lb weight class. In 2007, the NCWA approved All-American status for wrestlers placing in top 8. Previously, only the top 6 wrestlers in each weight class were named All-Americans. In 2010, the NCWA approved a two-division classification system - the Division I level composed of established teams meeting specific criteria and the Division II tier where up-start teams as well as teams aiming to join Division I would compete. Since the 2013\u20132014 season when the Collegiate Cup championship series was passed, teams' National Championships points are added with their National Dual Meet Championship finish points to determine the overall team champion. In 2020, multiple teams and individual wrestlers withdrew from the tournament before or during the tournament due to the COVID-19 pandemic. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%;

Championships. The NCWA sponsored this event under their new banner organization, the National Collegiate Women's Wrestling Association (NCWWA). The weight classes have been designed to closely resemble most female athletes' natural weight ranges as well as let programs that also compete in women's collegiate freestyle to acclimate to folkstyle competition. To date, the NCWA is still the only collegiate association in the United States to officially recognize women's collegiate wrestling. Whereas before matches were done using freestyle rules, as was the norm with associations like the WCWA, the NCWWA uses collegiate/folkstyle rules like in the NCWA, NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA. No team score was recorded at the inaugural 2008 tournament, but since then team score has been kept. Bo Icalia and Josh White are tied for head coaches to have won the most titles; Icalia won the 2010 and 2011 titles as head coach of Yakima Valley Community College and the 2012 and 2013 titles as head coach of Southwestern Oregon Community College. White has won the 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 titles all with Southwestern Oregon Community College. The top 3 wrestlers in each weight class are recognized as All-Americans. University of South Florida's Jasmine Grant is the NCWWA's first and only 4x All-American (2011\u20132014) so far. University of Maine's Samantha Frank has won 3 national titles going into the 2017\u20132018 season. The Women's College Wrestling Championships has traditionally been dominated by northern and northwestern teams. In 2020, multiple teams and individual wrestlers withdrew from the tournament before or after it had started in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\" |- !colspan=10|Women's Collegiate National Championships series history |- ! rowspan=\"2\"|Year ! rowspan=\"2\"|Host city (Host location) ! colspan=4|Team championship ! rowspan=\"2\"|Most Outstanding Wrestler (Team) |- !Winner !Points !Runner-up !Points |- |2008 |Lakeland, Florida (Lakeland Center) |colspan=4|No team score kept | |- |2009 |Hampton, Virginia (Hampton University) |Yakima Valley |73.0 |Simon Fraser |58.0 |Ashlee Phy (Yakima Valley) |- |2010 |Hampton, Virginia (Hampton University) |Yakima Valley | | | | |- |2011 |Macon, Georgia (Mercer University) |Yakima Valleyhttp://www.yakimaherald.com/sports |124.0 |Mercer |45.0 | |- |2012 |Daytona Beach, Florida (Ocean Center) |Southwestern Oregonhttp://www.goboxers.com/news/2012/3/12/WWREST_0312121801.aspx?path=wwrestling |83.5 |Pacific |61.5 |Erica Poe (Southwestern Oregon) |- |2013 |Allen, Texas (Allen Event Center) |Southwestern Oregon |100.0 |Lindenwood \u2013 Belleville |53.0 |Sonia Beri (San Jose) |- |2014 |Allen, Texas (Allen Event Center) |Southwestern Oregonhttp://www.ncwa.net/news?news_id=1397 |77.0 |West Chester |31.0 | |- |2015 |Allen, Texas (Allen Event Center) |Southwestern Oregonhttp://news.theopenmat.com/college- wrestling-news/liberty-wins-2015-ncwa-national-championships/57034 |128.0 |Ottawa |98.0 |Samantha Frank (Maine) |- |2016 |Kissimmee, Florida (Silver Spurs Arena) |Southwestern Oregon |127.0 |Ottawa |83.5 |Samantha Frank (Maine) |- |2017 |Allen, Texas (Allen Event Center) |Southwestern Oregon |97.5 |Ottawa |69.5 |Samantha Frank (Maine) |- |2018 |Allen, Texas (Allen Event Center) |Southwestern Oregon |134.0 |Midland |52.5 |Samantha Frank (Maine) |- |2019 |Allen, Texas (Allen Event Center) |Grays Harbor |65.5 |Schreiner |63.0 | |- |2020 |Allen, Texas (Allen Event Center) |Schreiner |170.5 |Umpqua |119.5 |Cendall Manley (Liberty)http://www.liberty.edu/news/index.cfm?PID=18495&MID;=379056 |- |} === GoGreco National Championships === Approved in 2016, the GoGreco Program was launched with USA Wrestling in order to improve the U.S.A.'s performance in Junior- and Senior-level Greco-Roman competition.

With the National Dual Meet Championship, the team that wins the Collegiate Cup will earn 24 team points. The runner-up will receive 23, third-place 22, and so forth until the 23rd-place team receives 2 points. All other teams that participated, but did not place in the top 23 will receive 1 point. Those points will be carried over to the individual-based National Championships where teams will continue to score points based on their individual athletes' performances. The winner of the Collegiate Cup will have accrued the most total points between both events and be presented with the College Cup as the overall NCWA National Champions. Grand Canyon University was the first champion of the new format in 2014. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Championship Year !! Champion School !! National Dual Meet Championship finish !!

Men's Division I programs are athletic department funded or have met the NCWA's D-I criteria. Many of the Division I programs also offer athletic scholarships. Men's Division II teams are broken into categories; Emerging Programs, that are developing into Division I teams, and Clubs that operate on campuses where there are established NCAA/NCAA/NJCAA Teams; few Division II schools are of the latter circumstance. Schools whose wrestling teams are competing in the NCWA during their school's transitional period are placed into Division I. Women's programs are any collegiate/post-seconday scholastic programs who also compete in the collegiate folkstyle ruleset. GoGreco programs have most of the same set-up as the men's and women's divisions with the exception that it is under a Greco-Roman ruleset. In August 2010, the current two-division system was passed at that year's Vision Forum and implemented for the 2011 National Championships. === Conferences === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
