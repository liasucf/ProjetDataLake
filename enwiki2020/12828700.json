    "text": "Exodus is a post-apocalyptic role-playing game published by Glutton Creeper Games using the d20/OGL system. Originally the game was licensed in the Fallout universe, but due to legal complications with Interplay and Bethesda Softworks, Fallouts current copyright holder, the publisher decided to continue working on the game with retaining most of its elements and excluding all references to Fallout. == History == The project of creating the Fallout pen and paper role-playing game based on d20 Modern system started in 2006 and the publisher obtained an 18-month license from Interplay, the creator of the original Fallout cRPG series. Legal complication arose in mid-2007, when Bethesda Softworks' lawyers claimed Interplay was unable to license a role- playing game and thus the contract between Glutton Creeper and Interplay was annulled.ZeniMax Media demands removal of references to Fallout In early 2009 Glutton Creeper and Interplay came to a resolution via a settlement over the license dispute. Glutton Creeper removed all references to a lawsuit, and redesigned their website. === Impact of losing copyright === Despite breaking with the Fallout franchise, Exodus kept most of its fundamental post- apocalyptic setting and key concepts from Fallout and other popular Apocalyptic media sources. The game designer dropped the 1950s postmodern stylistic influences and references for a more 1970's B-Movie apocalyptic science-fiction feel, with a large dose of parodies, past and present. === GCG vs. Interplay Lawsuit === Glutton Creeper filed legal action against Interplay in late 2007 on the Fallout license for breach of contract after Bethesda served a cease and desist notice on the development of a pen and paper RPG in the Fallout universe. Bethesda attempted to attach itself on the lawsuit but they were dismissed from the suit. Glutton and Interplay settled out of court in April 2009 for an undisclosed amount. Glutton Creeper sought judgement against Interplay for failure to meet the terms of the settlement agreement between the two companies. Interplay breached the first part of the terms in May 2010 by failing to comply with those terms. The second part of the terms to remain in effect until December 2012 became null. In March 2013 GCG won a judgment claim against Interplay. Interplay has stated they will appeal but they failed to file an appeal within the set timeframe. As of September 2013 Interplay has failed to pay the adjusted judgment. === GCG Shutdown === In August 2014 GCG was acquired by 4 Hour Games. == Exodus setting == Exodus is set in southwest United States in the year 2042. The storyline of Exodus encompass an alternative history of 20th century from 1939 to 2012, which is the year of nuclear war's outbreak. In December 2012, on the winter solstice, a date prophesied by the Maya as the end of evolution, a date prophesied by Nostradamus as World's End, man chose to evolve by the process of natural selection through self extermination from nuclear fallout. The decade long War on Terror escalated to a series of short events between many warring nations that ravaged the known world on all sides in 24 short hours forcing man into an Exodus that would last 20 years for the chosen survivors, before they could return to the ruins of civilization and start a new era of man. The survivors are the lucky ones, the people that made it to fallout shelters, and those that somehow survived against all odds. Exodus is fully supported by a line of OPS (Organized Playable Scenarios) adventures, which most are free or are available for a price through the Glutton Creeper online store. All of these adventures take place in the Southwest United States, and are designed to play for roughly 4 hours of time. ==External links== *Glutton Creeper Games ==References== Category:Post-apocalyptic role-playing games Category:Science fiction role-playing games Category:Role-playing games introduced in 2008 ",
