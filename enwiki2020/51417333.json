This was the first championship hosted only for swimming programs in the NCAA's University Division (future Division I). The inaugural College Division (future Divisions II and III) championship was contested in Grove City, Pennsylvania and won by Bucknell. USC once again topped the team standings, finishing five points ahead of Indiana, and claimed their third overall title (and third title in four years). ==Team standings== *Note: Top 10 only *(H) = Hosts *Full results {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Rank !!
