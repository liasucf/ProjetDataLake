    "text": "Great and Lady Soul was the name of a six-piece pop band from Widnes, Cheshire, England. Formed in 1985, the band signed to Virgin Records in 1988, releasing two singles on seven-inch and twelve-inch vinyl formats. A long- playing record was recorded but not released. The name itself is taken out of context from an autobiography by the jazz bass-player Charles Mingus, called Beneath the Underdog. The band's debut single, \"Trace the Line (To my Heart)\", was released in February 1989, backed by the song \"Harriet Walk\", named after a street in London. The second single, \"I Won't Hold My Breath\", was released in May 1989, backed by the song \"Stretch\". Band members were Greg Oldfield (vocals), Tim Leather (guitar), Stewart Leather (guitar), Tony Dagnall (keyboards), Damien Amos (bass), and David Wycherley (drums).
