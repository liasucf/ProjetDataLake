The village name has been spelled in various ways, including Acangre (10th century), Hohangra (early 12th century), Ochangra, Achangre, and Hachangre (late 12th century). Although the area has been settled since the Iron Age, the first mention of Oakhanger itself was in a charter from the early 10th century, which stated the boundaries of lands granted by Edward of Wessex to Frithestan, the Bishop of Winchester. In the reign of Edward the Confessor the lands of Oakhanger were assessed to be worth 40 shillings. At the time of the Domesday Survey in 1086, Oakhanger was held by Edwin, who had purchased it from Richard I. The identity of Edwin is unclear, however during the 12th century the manor was evidently held by a family that took the surname of Oakhanger \u2013 thus William de Oakhanger was in possession of the village in 1167. In 1250 James de Oakhanger, the grandson of William de Oakhanger, was inheritated the lands of the village until ownership was passed down to his son in 1279.

Paynel died two years later, leaving his daughter Maud, the wife of Nicholas de Upton, heir to two parts of Oakhanger. In 1476, Oakhanger was held by Richard West, who then died and left the lands to his son and heir Thomas West, who died in 1525 leaving it to his son, also named Thomas. The latter died without children in 1554 and the manor of Oakhanger was passed to Lady Jane Dudley, Duchess of Northumberland; although it was described as \"one acre in Oakhanger held in chief for the hundredth part of a knight's fee\". On her death, the lands of Oakhanger were transferred to Ambrose Dudley, however it was reverted to the crown along with the rest of his property when he died without heirs in 1589. In the late 16th century, Richard Pescod was forced to sell his lease of Oakhanger Ponds to Richard Springham, a mercer of London, as he knew that Pescod was in debt. Pescod promised to lend him \u00a3100 or more for a \"reasonable time\", as well as a yearly rent of forty carps from the ponds. The lease lasted for around forty years until Pescod's death. Edward Wilcox gave the manor of Oakhanger to his only daughter and heir Margaret in 1724, who seven years later, sold the lands to John Conduit. By the will of Conduit, Oakhanger was passed on to his only daughter and heir Catherine, who married Lord Viscount Lymington in 1736. By an Act of Parliament of 1748\u20139 for selling the settled estates of Catherine Lymington, Oakhanger was then sold to Henry Bilson Legge. In 1750, Henry Bilson Legge married Mary, and created the title of Baroness Stawell in 1760. Their son, Henry Bilson-Legge, Lord Stawell, married the daughter of Viscount Curzon, who died without male heirs in 1820. Their only daughter Mary married John Dutton, the only son and heir of James Sherborne, from whom the manor of Oakhanger was passed by inheritance to Henry John Dutton, the last owner as of 1908.
