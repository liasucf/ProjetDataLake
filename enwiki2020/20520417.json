Taison then after making his first team debut in 2009, confirmed his place as one of the rising stars in world football after top scoring in the 2009 Campeonato Ga\u00facho with 15 goals and starring alongside strike partner Nilmar. Internacional also went on to win the tournament after an 8\u20131 victory over Caxias. Despite never winning the Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A Taison does have a Copa Libertadores winners medal after he was an instrumental part in his side's 2010 success, starting both legs of Internacional's aggregate 5\u20133 final victory over Mexican side Guadalajara. ===Metalist Kharkiv=== After being linked with a host of clubs across Europe, including Wolfsburg and Napoli Taison eventually signed for Ukrainian club Metalist Kharkiv for an approximate fee of 6 million euros. He started brightly in Ukraine and even pipped Willian to the \"best new signing\" accolade. The Brazilian scored an incredible Marco van Basten style volley against Rosenborg BK on 8 November 2012 in the Europa League. In the same game he also provided the assist for the second in a 3\u20131 win. ===Shakhtar Donetsk=== Taison signed with Shakhtar Donetsk on 1 January 2013 for a fee of around \u00a312.4 million. He made his debut for Shakhtar in the Champions League against Borussia Dortmund in a 2\u20132 draw on 13 February 2013. He scored his first goal for Shakhtar and was named Man of the Match in a 3\u20133 draw with Metalurh Zaporizhya on 19 May 2013, scoring an equalising goal in the 92nd minute. Taison scored in a 3\u20130 victory over Chornomorets Odesa in the 2012\u201313 Ukrainian Cup final. On 10 July 2013 Taison scored in a 3\u20131 victory over Chornomorets in the Ukrainian Super Cup. In November 2019 he was sent-off after reacting to alleged racist abuse, and was also given a one-match ban. ==International career== In an interview with the coach of the Ukraine national team, Mykhaylo Fomenko spoke of him as a possible naturalized. Taison indicated that he would be likely to accept a call-up for Ukraine if asked. But on 22 August 2016, newly appointed manager Tite has called him up for the Brazil national team. On 13 June 2017, Taison scored his first international goal in a match against Australia, that ended 4\u20130. He scored the 3rd goal of the match. In May 2018, he was named in Tite\u2019s final 23 man squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:120px;\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !width=\"40\"|Apps !width=\"40\"|Goals !width=\"40\"|Apps !width=\"40\"|Goals !width=\"40\"|Apps !width=\"40\"|Goals !width=\"40\"|Apps !width=\"40\"|Goals !width=\"40\"|Apps !width=\"40\"|Goals |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Internacional |2008 |30||2||-||-||9||0||-||-||39||2 |- |2009 |28||4||12||7||4||0||19||15||63||26 |- |2010 |11||3||-||-||11||0||14||4||36||7 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !69!!9!!12!!7!!24!!0!!33!!19!!138!!35 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Metalist Kharkiv |2010\u201311 |21||8||0||0||6||1||0||0||27||9 |- |2011\u201312 |23||2||0||0||13||5||0||0||36||7 |- |2012\u201313 |13||3||1||0||6||1||0||0||20||4 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !57!!13!!1!!0!!25!!7!!0!!0!!83!!20 |- |rowspan=\"8\"|Shakhtar Donetsk |2012\u201313 ||11||2||3||1||2||0||0||0||16||3 |- |2013\u201314 ||19||1||4||1||8||1||1||1||32||4 |- |2014\u201315 ||21||4||6||0||8||0||1||0||36||4 |- |2015\u201316 ||18||6||6||1||17||1||1||0||42||8 |- |2016\u201317 ||24||5||3||1||12||4||1||0||40||10 |- |2017\u201318 ||24||4||3||2||8||1||1||0||36||7 |- |2018\u201319 ||25||3||3||0||7||3||0||0||35||6 |- |2019\u201320 ||25||10||1||0||8||0||1||0||35||10 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !167!!35!!29!!6!!70!!10!!6!!1!!272!!52 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Career Total !293!!57!!42!!13!!119!!17!!39!!20!!493!!107 |} *Other \u2013 Campeonato Ga\u00facho & Ukrainian Super Cup ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" ! colspan=4|Brazil |- !Year !width=\"40\"|Apps !width=\"40\"|Goals |- |2016 ||2||0 |- |2017 ||3||1 |- |2018 ||3||0 |- !Total !8!!1 |} ====International goals==== :Scores and results list Brazil's goal tally first. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%\" |- ! # !!
