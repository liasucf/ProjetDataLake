It shows how the female leaders find difficulties in raising their voices in the world all of men. Its also about how the intermediaries take most of the money sent by the government and very little reaches the actual receiver. At Parmino, the local village committee is all male. But suddenly comes the announcement that an amendment has been passed in the Indian constitution asking for the Committee to have women as one third of them. The village head, Ratan and members decide to let the women in their families contest on the reserved seats in the hope that they would continue to have their writ run. While Ratan Singh asks his son, Inder, to get Manju, his wife, to contest, the other members get their wives to contest. Also asked to contest is Vidya, the newly marred bride of a poor store owner, Bhanwar, who is indebted to the village head.
