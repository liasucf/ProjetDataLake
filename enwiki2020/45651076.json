    "text": "Matthew Coffin Butterick (born November 15, 1970)California State Bar Profile is an American typographer, lawyer, writer, and computer programmer. He received the 2012 Golden Pen Award from the Legal Writing Institute for his book Typography for Lawyers, which started as a website in 2008 based on his experience as a practicing attorney. He has worked for The Font Bureau and founded his own website design company, Atomic Vision (purchased by Red Hat in 1999). Expanding Typography for Lawyers, Butterick published Practical Typography as a \"web-based book\" in July 2013. Butterick graduated with a BA in visual and environmental studies from Harvard University. He later earned a JD at the University of California, Los Angeles and was admitted to the State Bar of California in 2007. ==Typefaces== Butterick's typeface designs include: ===For Font Bureau=== * Wessex (1993), transitional text serif inspired by Bulmer and Caledonia * Herald Gothic (1993), a bevelled sans-serif * Berlin Sans (1994, part), a flared sans-serif * Hermes (1995), a blocky sans-serif loosely inspired by Berthold Block * Alix, a typewriter font ===Self- released=== Butterick's serif font Equity * Equity, an updating of the 1930s body text serif design Ehrhardt. Features grades designed to suit different types of paper and printers, and separate small caps fonts intended for use in Word. * Concourse, loosely inspired by Dwiggins' geometric sans-serif design Metro. Features stylistic alternates and small caps. * Triplicate, a monospaced slab serif design inspired by typewriter fonts such as the default face used in the IBM Selectric. Essentially a further development of Alix, with more variants including a proportional version and a style designed specifically for displaying code. * Advocate, a caps-only slab and sans serif design. Reminiscent of mid-century American college sports team lettering, corporate logos and Bank Gothic. Somewhat resembles an expansion of Herald Gothic. ==References== ==External links== *Butterick's Practical Typography website *Equity *Concourse Category:Lawyers from Los Angeles Category:American typographers Category:American instructional writers Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:Living people Category:Harvard University alumni Category:UCLA School of Law alumni Category:People from Ann Arbor, Michigan Category:1970 births ",
