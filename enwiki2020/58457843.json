The route is shown on the Harvest Plan Operational Maps. The remains of the trestles, embankments and cuttings are protected as cultural heritage. The objective of the relevant prescriptions is to preserve all substantial remnants of earthworks and infrastructure, especially cuttings where encountered.Mark Sute und Justin Williams: Variation No. 1 of Harvesting Plan for Compartments 193, 194 & 195, Lansdowne State Forest. 19 June 2015.

Historic structures in the tramway corridor may not be disturbed. Trees are not to be felled into the tramway corridor, where a cutting exists, however, if a tree is accidentally felled, it may be removed, if this can be carried out without causing damage to the cutting. Felling of trees out of the tramway corridor may only be approved if the activity will not cause damage to the cuttings. Machinery may not enter the tramway corridor except to cross, where the tramway is level with the ground surface, i.e. where no substantial earthworks are present. Snigging along the tramway is not permitted. == Additional literature == * The Langley Vale tramway \u2013 Part 1, 1897\u20131912 (New South Wales).
