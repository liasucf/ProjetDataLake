    "text": "The Hagerstown Roundhouse Museum located at 300 South Burhans Boulevard, Hagerstown, Maryland, USA, has exhibits relating to local railroad history and model railroads. The Hagerstown Roundhouse Complex was built in 1939. The 25 stall roundhouse and shops were the major facility for maintenance and repairs of locomotives and cars in Western Maryland. The railroads were the largest employers in Washington County for more than 50 years. The Roundhouse facility was demolished on March 13, 1999. The Hagerstown Roundhouse Museum is located adjacent to the CSX Railroad in Hagerstown, Maryland. The volunteer-run museum features many exhibits relating to local railroad history, several model railroads in operation, and an outdoor collection of locomotives, passenger cars, and rolling stock. The roundhouse facility was demolished in 1999, but the museum inhabits some of the smaller adjacent buildings and sits in proximity to CSX Transportation's Hagerstown Terminal yard and locomotive servicing area. ==References== ==External links== * Hagerstown Roundhouse Museum * HawkinsRails' Hagerstown Roundhouse Museum page Category:Buildings and structures in Hagerstown, Maryland Category:Museums in Washington County, Maryland Category:Railroad museums in Maryland Category:Railroad roundhouses in Maryland Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Washington County, Maryland ",
