    "text": "Prema Murthy (b. 1969) is an American, multi-disciplinary artist based in New York. Employing aesthetics, gesture, geometry and algorithmic processes, Murthy's work explores the boundaries between embodiment and abstraction, while engaging in issues of culture and politics. She is known for her pioneering digital art works that contributed to the cyberfeminist art movement, as well as for her collaboration with the art group Fakeshop, which she co-founded. Her work has been exhibited nationally and internationally at MoMA PS1, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the New Museum of Contemporary Art, the Reina Sofia Museum, the Generali Foundation in Vienna, and the India Habitat Center-New Delhi. == Education == Murthy received a BA in Art History and Women's Studies from the University of Texas, Austin and MFA from Goldsmith's College, London. ==Career== Murthy's early digital art works from the 1990s - such as Bindigirl and Mythic Hybrid - are considered pioneering examples of internet art from a feminist perspective.Rachel Greene, Internet Art (World of Art) (Thames & Hudson, 2004), pp. 212-14; Kelly Dennis, \"Gendered Ghosts in the Globalized Machine: Coco Fusco and Prema Murthy,\" Paradoxa: International Feminist Art Journal, Vol. 23 (2009): pp. 79-86. These works explored the intersections of gender, race, and technology, while also utilizing the then-emerging tools of streaming media as a platform for performance art.\"Bindigirl - Interview with Prema Murthy,\" Rhizome.org (2 June 1999); Gonz\u00e1lez, Jennifer. \"Morphologies: Race as a Digital Technology,\" in Re:Skin, ed.

McGahan, \"Re-Posing Porn and the Racialized Subject in Cyberculture: Prema Murthy's Bindigirl, Cyberfeminism, and the Culturalist Politics of Orientalized Pornography on the Internet,\" Racing Cyberculture: Minoritarian Art and Cultural Politics on the Internet (Routledge, 2013), pp. 123-161.
