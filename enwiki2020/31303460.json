It passed to his nephews upon his death. They transferred it to their relative, Mark Harwell Pettway, also a native of Halifax County North Carolina, in 1845 in order to settle a $29,000 debt. Pettway brought his family and roughly 100 slaves here in 1846. All of the slaves, except for the cook, made the journey on foot. The main house was built around this time. The main house was razed sometime soon after the last owner sold the property to the Farm Security Administration in 1937. The administration built New Deal type houses and sold the tracks of farmland to what were mostly the impoverished descendants of the former Pettway slaves. The community of Boykin is at the same approximate location as the original \"slave village\" for the plantation. |- | |74000418 |Saunders Hall |100px |Town Creek |Lawrence |Built 1830 |- | |78000494 |Spring Villa |100px |Opelika |Lee |Built 1850 |- | |01001411 |Stone Plantation |100px |Montgomery |Montgomery |Built 1852 |- | | |Stoutenborough Hall |100px |Elm Bluff |Dallas |Built 1850 |- | |91000095 |Summers Plantation |100px |Opelika |Lee |Built 1837 |- | |85000451 |Sylvan Plantation | |Tuscaloosa |Tuscaloosa |Built 1825 |- | |73000346 |Tanglewood |100px |Akron |Hale |Built 1859 |- | |Tasso Plantation |100px |Orrville vicinity |Dallas |Built 1850s |- | |84000618 |Thornhill |100px |Forkland |Greene |Built 1833, portico added c.1850. |- | |98000104 |Thornhill |100 px |Talladega vicinity |Talladega |Built 1835 |- | |Tulip Hill | |Faunsdale |Marengo |Home of Andrew Pickens Calhoun |- | |Umbria |100px |Sawyerville vicinity |Hale |Built 1829\u201350, burned 1973. |- | | |Underwood Plantation |100px |Pleasant Hill |Dallas |Built 1845, also known as the Green Underwood House, Underwood-Mayo HomeAnte-Bellum Mansions of Alabama and Black Thistle |- | |Wakefield |100px |Furman vicinity |Wilcox |Built 1840 |- | |94000684 |Waldwic |100px |Gallion |Hale |Built 1840\u201352 |- | |Walnut Grove Plantation |100px |Allenvillevicinity |Hale & Marengo |\"A frame residence of eight rooms, one of the first homes of so pretentious forms in that country,\"Alabama Historical Quarterly (Summer, 1930), p. 109; Dubose, \"Chronicles of the Canebrake,\" built by H.
