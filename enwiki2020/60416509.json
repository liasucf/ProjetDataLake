    "text": "Alexandra Boltasseva is Ron And Dotty Garvin Tonjes Professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue University, and editor-in-chief for The Optical Society's Optical Materials Express journal. Her research focuses on plasmonic metamaterials, manmade composites of metals that use surface plasmons to achieve optical properties not seen in nature. == Education and Career == Boltasseva studied her bachelor and masters in physics at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, completing her research projects on quantum-well lasers at the Lebedev Physical Institute. She moved to the Technical University of Denmark for her PhD studies in nanophotonics and nanofabrication, working with Sergey I. Bozhevolnyi. Following her PhD, Boltasseva worked at two photonics start-up companies before returning to the Technical University of Denmark as a postdoc and subsequently an associate professor. In 2008 she moved to Purdue University and is currently the Ron And Dotty Garvin Tonjes Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, as well as holding a courtsey appointment in Materials Engineering. == Research == Comparing graphene, complex oxides, and transition metal nitrides, she noted that the latter are thermally stable and biocompatible as well as compatible with computer systems. In the future, this research may let us combine optics with scale of traditional electronics. ==Awards== A.
