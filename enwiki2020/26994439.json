    "text": "Mitrella nympha is a species of sea snail in the family Columbellidae, the dove snails. ==Description== Members of the order Neogastropoda are mostly gonochoric and broadcast spawners. After birth, Mitrella nympha embryos develop into planktonic trocophore larvae, then into juvenile veligers before becoming fully grown adults. Their shells vary between 9 mm and 13 mm in size and are in the shape of narrow tapered spirals. ==Distribution== This marine species occurs in the Red Sea and off the Philippines. ==References== * Vine, P.
