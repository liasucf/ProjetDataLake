World and national news is supplied from Fox News Radio. ==History== The station signed on in September 1952 as WRAP, a daytimer at 1050 kHz, powered at only 500 watts.Broadcasting Yearbook 1953 page 303 It was required to sign-off at sunset to avoid interfering with other radio stations on AM 1050, primarily XEG in Monterrey, Mexico. In 1956, another Norfolk daytimer, 860 WCAV, left the air, allowing WRAP to relocate to AM 850. On the new frequency, WRAP could broadcast around the clock. The daytime power was increased to 5,000 watts and the nighttime power to 1,000 watts.Broadcasting Yearbook 1957 page 268 WRAP was programmed to Norfolk's African-American community. Its call sign used the word \"RAP,\" an African-American English word for \"talk\" or \"discussion.\" (It would be several decades before \"rap\" began referring to a musical style.) An advertisement in the 1957 edition of Broadcasting Yearbook, using the descriptions of the era, said \"Survey figures show the most Negroes in the Norfolk area listen most to WRAP.\" It added that WRAP, at 850 kilocycles, was \"the only all-Negro station in Norfolk.\" For more on the history of the station, see WRAP (Norfolk). In 1987, WRAP was acquired by local cable TV company Clinton Cablevision (later Sinclair Telecable).Broadcasting Yearbook 1991 page D-247 The new owner flipped the format to talk. The call sign was changed to WNIS, standing for News and Information Station. The R&B; format and WRAP call letters moved to AM 1350 in nearby Portsmouth (now gospel- formatted WGPL). WNIS picked up programming from ABC Talkradio, NBC Talknet and the Mutual Broadcasting System's Larry King Show. The host who launched the new format was Gordon Hammett, a New York City radio veteran who had more than 40 years in the industry with stints that included WNBC, WMCA, and WNEW. He started a club called the Tidewater Talkers for his loyal listeners. His guests ranged from Sen. John Warner to Al Goldstein. In July 1997, WNIS and its sister station, WTAR, switched dial positions. WNIS moved to AM 790, while WTAR took over the 850 kHz spot on the dial.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1998 page D-461 850 has the stronger signal, broadcasting at 50,000 watts by day, the highest power authorized for commercial AM stations by the Federal Communications Commission. At night it runs 25,000 watts, while 790 kHz is powered at 5,000 watts day and night. Both stations had talk formats, although 850 WTAR is now a sports radio station and network affiliate of Fox Sports Radio. ==References== ==External links== * AM 790 WNIS Online * Sinclair Telecable List of Stations NIS Category:News and talk radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1923 Category:1923 establishments in Virginia ",
