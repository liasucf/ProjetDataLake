In 1936 she finished fifth in the 200 metre breaststroke event, the single breaststroke event until the 1968 Olympics. At the 1938 European Aquatics Championships in London she won a bronze medal on the same distance. On May 11, 1937 she broke Hideko Maehata's four-year-old breaststroke record by 0.2 seconds (3:00.2). On Jun 27 of that year, in Zaandijk, she improved on that record by more than 2 seconds to 2:58.0. She improved her own world record once more on October 2 to 2:56.9. She further held world records in the unconventional distances of 200 yard, 400 m and 500 m breaststroke. ==External links== *profile *profile (in Dutch) Category:1920 births Category:1979 deaths Category:Dutch female swimmers Category:Female breaststroke swimmers Category:World record setters in swimming Category:Olympic swimmers of the Netherlands Category:Sportspeople from Amsterdam Category:Swimmers at the 1936 Summer Olympics Category:European Aquatics Championships medalists in swimming ",
