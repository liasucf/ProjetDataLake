(Cultural Foundation for the Mexican Society) is a Mexican civil association whose primary activity is the operation of radio stations. The radio stations owned by FCSM are noncommercial (social) stations with Radio Maria programming.

The stations at Ensenada, Zamora, Guasave, Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n and San Miguel de Allende were awarded in 2017 and 2018; Le\u00f3n was approved in December 2019. Ensenada launched in February 2020. Since 2003, FCSM has programmed XELT-AM in Guadalajara, with the station's commercial concession registered to Televisa Radio.
