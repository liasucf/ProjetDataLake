White's play was rewarded when he was invited to skate in the 2014 CCM/USA Hockey All-American Prospects Game. In his final season with the U.S. NTDP, White recorded 17 points in 20 games. White was selected in the first round, 21st overall, by the Ottawa Senators in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. White played college hockey at Boston College from 2015 to 2017.

He recorded three points in three games. On April 2, the Ottawa Senators signed White to a three-year, entry-level contract. He made his NHL debut the following day in a 5\u20134 loss to the Detroit Red Wings. White split his first professional season between Ottawa and Binghamton. On February 6, 2018, he recorded his first career NHL goal in a 5\u20133 win over the New Jersey Devils. He finished his first season in Ottawa with six points in 21 games. In his first full season with Ottawa, White recorded 14 goals and 41 points in 71 games.

He scored 2 goals and 3 points in 10 games to help the United States claim the Bronze Medal in Denmark.
