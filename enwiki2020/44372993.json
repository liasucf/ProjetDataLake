    "text": "Trumbo is a 2015 American biographical drama film directed by Jay Roach and written by John McNamara. The film stars Bryan Cranston, Diane Lane, Helen Mirren, Louis C.K., Elle Fanning, John Goodman, and Michael Stuhlbarg. The film follows the life of Hollywood screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, and is based on the 1977 biography Dalton Trumbo by Bruce Alexander Cook. The film was shown in the Special Presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival on September 12, 2015, and was released on November 6, 2015, by Bleecker Street. The film received generally positive reviews, with Bryan Cranston being nominated for several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor, although the film itself was criticized for historical inaccuracies and misportrayals of people, places, and events. ==Plot== Dalton Trumbo is a screenwriter whose talent places him among the elite of Hollywood. However, his active membership in the Communist Party of the USA draws the contempt of staunchly anti-Soviet entertainment-industry figures such as columnist Hedda Hopper and actor John Wayne. Trumbo is one of 10 screenwriters subpoenaed to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) regarding Communist propaganda in Hollywood films. They refuse to directly answer questions, confident that a liberal majority on the Supreme Court will overturn the convictions for Contempt of Congress. Trumbo's friend Edward G. Robinson, who supports the cause, sells Vincent van Gogh's 1887 painting Portrait of P\u00e8re Tanguy to raise money for their legal defense fund. The unexpected deaths of Justices Wiley Rutledge and Frank Murphy ruin Trumbo's plan to appeal to the Supreme Court. In 1950, Trumbo serves 11 months in Federal Correctional Institution in Ashland, Kentucky. As the Hollywood Blacklist expands to exclude more communists and communist sympathizers from working in the industry, Trumbo and his comrades are abandoned by Robinson and producer Buddy Ross, who disavow them to protect their careers. Trumbo is released from prison, but he remains blacklisted and his finances \u2013 and family life \u2013 become increasingly strained. He resorts to giving the screenplay for Roman Holiday to his friend Ian McLellan Hunter, to take credit and a share of the money, and eventually the Academy Award for Best Story. Selling his idyllic lakeside home and moving to a house in the city, he goes to work as a pseudonymous screenwriter for the low-budget King Brothers Productions, also farming out the writing of B-movie screenplays to fellow blacklisted writers. He puts his wife Cleo and teenage children to work as his support staff, adding to domestic conflict. King Brothers' film The Brave One, an original story by Trumbo under a pseudonym, receives an Academy Award he cannot claim. His blacklisted friend Arlen Hird dies from cancer, destitute, but an attempt by Hedda Hopper's allies to intimidate the head of King Brothers into firing Trumbo fails completely. Over time, industry suspicion of Trumbo's ghostwriting develops, but he is careful not to confirm it. In 1960, actor Kirk Douglas recruits him to write the screenplay for his epic film Spartacus, and director Otto Preminger recruits him to script Exodus. Both men publicly credit him as the screenwriter, despite Hopper's futile efforts to intimidate Douglas into dropping Trumbo. By 1960, the effectiveness of the Blacklist has been broken to the point where newly elected US President John F. Kennedy publicly endorses Spartacus, and Trumbo and others are able to begin rebuilding their careers. Douglas said of his decision to credit Trumbo as screenwriter, \"I was threatened that using a Blacklisted writer for Spartacus \u2013 my friend Dalton Trumbo \u2014 would mark me as a \"Commie-lover\" and end my career. There are times when one has to stand up for principle.\"https://deadline.com/2015/11/kirk-douglas-speaks-out-trumbo-career- threatened-blacklist-1201629542/ Ten years later, finally receiving his due accolades from Hollywood, Trumbo speaks about how the Blacklist victimized them all: those who stood by their principles and lost their jobs, and also those who compromised their principles to keep them. ==Cast== ==Production== On September 18, 2013, Bryan Cranston joined the cast to play Dalton Trumbo.

The site's critical consensus states, \"Trumbo serves as an honorable and well-acted tribute to a brilliant writer's principled stand, even if it doesn't quite achieve the greatness of its subject's own classic screenplays.\" Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Peter Debruge of Variety gave the film a positive review, saying, \"Trumbo may be clumsy and overly simplistic at times, but it's still an important reminder of how democracy can fail (that is, when a fervent majority turns on those with different and potentially threatening values), and the strength of character it takes to fight the system.\" Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \"It's a cracking good story, and Cranston does a great job portraying a man who made great sacrifices for his principles.\" Manohla Dargis of The New York Times gave the film a negative review, saying \"Part biopic, part historical gloss, Trumbo tells a great-man story with a patchwork of fact and fiction, mixing in the odd bit of newsreel with a great many dull, visually flat and poorly lighted dramatic scenes.\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"Trumbo is breezy and pithy without ever undercutting the seriousness of the subject. A certain degree of wit is appropriate in a writer's story, just as any Hollywood tale must at least have a whiff of absurdity, or else it can't be true.\" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"Trumbo is a corny, well-made B-movie about an A-list screenwriter who had to take jobs writing B-movies after he was blacklisted, but eventually worked his way back to writing A-movies with Kirk Douglas a.k.a. Spartacus as his champion.\" Jordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, saying \"What makes the movie work are the lively performances, both from the supporting cast and from Cranston, who sheds the mimicry and pontificating of earlier scenes to turn Trumbo into a wry, self-deprecating and somewhat cheeky older man, even if he continued to stand up for what was right.\" Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"Cranston's performance is the motor that runs Trumbo, and that motor never idles, never flags in momentum or magnetism or idealistic scorn.\" Alonso Duralde of TheWrap gave the film a positive review, saying \"Roach and McNamara fall victim to the occasional phony biopic moment or straight-up moment of didacticism, but overall Trumbo is a lively history about the day-in-day-out drudgery of survival during oppressive times. Screenwriters are so rarely taken seriously by the film industry that it's a nice switch to watch them be the heroes.\" Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \"Roach's film may be light in places, even sugarcoated in others, but any reminder of the past and its impact on the future is a welcome one. Plus, we get a good Cranston performance in the bargain.\" Despite generally positive reviews, several reviewers criticized the film for being historically misleading or ideologically manipulative. Godfrey Cheshire of the Roger Ebert Journal wrote that Trumbo is \"another of those simplistic, made-to-order films about the Hollywood blacklist in which the blacklisted movie folks are all innocent, in every conceivable way.\" Cheshire decried the film's insinuation that the House Committee on Un-American Activities created the Hollywood blacklist and that \"Sen. Joseph McCarthy had something to do with Congress' pursuit of Hollywood.\" Cheshire also criticized the film for mainstreaming communism: \"it invites us to see the Communist Party USA as just another political party rather than as the domestic instrument of a hostile and ultra-murderous foreign tyranny.\" Other critics raised similar historical concerns. While the film portrays Trumbo as \"a New Deal liberal hero defending civil liberties\", Ron Capshaw in The American Spectator stated the real Trumbo was an outspoken supporter of Soviet-style communism, including Joseph Stalin and North Korean dictator Kim Il-sung. The conservative Pat Buchanan questioned the appropriateness of portraying Trumbo as a \"martyr to the first amendment\" while overlooking his support for regimes that actively suppress free speech. Armond White of National Review went a step further, accusing director Jay Roach of \"unrestrained partisanship\" for whitewashing the history of communism to invent a hero that supports Roach's political views. ===Accolades=== Bryan Cranston received numerous award nominations for his portrayal of Trumbo, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\" |- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\" ! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\" | Awards |- style=\"background:#ccc; text- align:center;\" !

Robinson betraying his friend Dalton Trumbo and others by naming them as communists before the House Un- American Activities Committee. Robinson testified four times before the committee and eventually stated that he had been a dupe of communist front organizations.Ross, Steven J. Hollywood Left and Right: How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics, Oxford University Press, 2011 According to the transcript of a hearing on April 30, 1952, Robinson gave the following testimony: \"Well, you had Albert Maltz, and you have Dalton Trumbo, and you have\u2014what is the other fellow, the top fellow who they say is the commissar out there?\", and after being prompted by his questioner (Mr. Walter), Robinson continued: \"Yes, John Howard Lawson. I knew Frank Tuttle. I didn't know Dmytryk at all. There are the Buchmans, that I know, Sidney Buchman and all that sort of thing. It never entered my mind that any of these people were Communists.\"Testimony of Edward G. Robinson before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, April, 1952. U.S. Government Printing Office, 1952, p. 2421. His testimony is re-enacted in the film, but with alterations, including to some of the names and their order. For instance, instead of John Howard Lawson, the composite character, Arlen Hird, is identified as \"the commissar\".Trumbo, Apple iTunes M4V video file, beginning at minute 46:20. ==References== ;Notes ;Citations ==External links== * * * Category:2015 films Category:2015 biographical drama films Category:2010s biographical films Category:American biographical drama films Category:American biographical films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films about the Hollywood blacklist Category:Films about screenwriters Category:Films set in Kentucky Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films set in Washington, D.C.
