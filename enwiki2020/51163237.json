Each team played the other teams four times, totaling 36 games. Only the champions, Dundalk, were automatically promoted and there was no promotion/relegation play-off between Premier Division and First Division teams. This was because the 2009 Premier Division would be reduced to 10 clubs. ==Final table== ==Results== ===Matches 1 to 18=== ===Rounds 19 and 36=== ==Promotion/Relegation play-offs== Kildare County and Mervue United, the highest ranked non-reserve team from the 2008 A Championship, played off to see who would play in the 2009 First Division. Mervue United won 5\u20132 on aggregate and were promoted to the First Division. ==Top scorers== {| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\" !Goalscorers !Goals !Team |- | Robbie Doyle |align=center|16 |Sporting Fingal |- | Anthony Flood |align=center|15 |Shelbourne |- | Darren McKenna |align=center|13 |Longford Town |- | Robbie Farrell |align=center|11 |Dundalk |- | Vinny Sullivan |align=center|11 |Waterford United |- |} ==Gallery== Image:Football league of ireland season 08.png|The clubs competing in the 2008 FAI eircom League of Ireland ==See also== * 2008 League of Ireland Premier Division * 2008 League of Ireland Cup * 2008 A Championship ==References== Category:League of Ireland First Division seasons Category:2008 League of Ireland Category:2008 in Republic of Ireland association football leagues Ireland Ireland ",
