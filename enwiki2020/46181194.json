    "text": "Sayre Gomez (born 1982) is a contemporary American artist who lives and works in Los Angeles. ==Early life and career== Sayre Gomez was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1982. He received his BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2005 and his MFA from the California Institute of the Arts in 2008. Gomez was a student of Michael Asher. ==Work== Sayre Gomez works across mediums, namely painting, sculpture and video, to address themes of perception and representation in the face of patriarchal political systems. Recurring metaphors such as windows are often used as a structural approach to investigating the role of context in the distribution and legibility of images in the 21st century. His work references the history of appropriation in tandem with a realist approach to rendering as a way of situating his practice within the traditions of conceptual art as well as pop art and the Pictures Generation. Shortly after graduating from CalArts, Gomez began his early \u2018Thief\u2019 paintings. In these combinations of his characteristic trompe l\u2019oeil effect and abstraction, a plane of colours\u2014often a pool of blurred and splattered paint washes\u2014is in the process of being lifted by a pair of covert gloved hands.The imagery was inspired by an illustration that a friend had posted to Gomez\u2019s Facebook wall. ==Exhibitions== Gomez's work has been included in solo exhibitions at Francois Ghebaly Gallery in Los Angeles, Ca., Galerie Nagel Draxler in Berlin, DE., Galerie Rodolphe Janssen in Brussels, BE., Galerie Parisa Kind in Frankfurt, DE., Michael Jon Gallery in Miami, Fl., Kavi Gupta Gallery in Chicago, Il., and The HOLE in New York, Ny.
