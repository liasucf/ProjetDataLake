Two tournaments were held at the same time, due to the establishment of Federaci\u00f3n Argentina de Football (FAF), a dissident association which organised its own championship. Thus, Quilmes won the official AFA tournament, while Porte\u00f1o won the FAF title. The AFA season began on April 14 and ended on December 13 while the FAF season began on July 11 and ended on December 23.Argentina 1912 by Osvaldo Gorgazzi at RSSSF.com ==Final tables== === Asociaci\u00f3n Argentina de Football - Copa Campeonato === Many former players of Alumni (dissolved one year later) went to play for Quilmes, which would be the champion.
