Its name is derived from the town in which it lies (West Milton), and the township which it serves (Union Township). It is the only high school in the Milton-Union Exempted Village Schools district. The school's mascot is a bulldog. The school met all twelve indicators on the 2009-2010 Ohio Department of Education report card, earning an \"Excellent\" rating. ==History== The Milton-Union Exempted Village School District was formed in 1936 when the Milton Village District and Union Township District merged. The former building was erected in 1938 and has been renovated and added to many times during its existence. In 2008, voters approved a measure to build a new K-12 building.https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/local/milton-school-building- will-gold-standard-green/SBPlEYIMWJRkpCTyFmhmIL/ The old high school, elementary and junior high were demolished in 2013http://www.oldohioschools.com/miami_county.htm. The new building has been built and is currently in use. The district is one of the few in the Dayton area to be served by only one each of elementary, junior high, and high school. ==Athletics== Milton-Union competes in the Southwestern Buckeye League (SWBL) in the Buckeye division as of the 2010-2011 school year. Previously the Bulldogs were a member of the Southwestern Division of the SWBL. Milton-Union has been a member of two leagues in its history: the Southwestern Buckeye League (originally named the Little Western Buckeye League) from 1940 to 1981, and the Southwestern Rivers Conference from 1982 to 2000. Milton-Union rejoined the Southwestern Buckeye League in 2001.
