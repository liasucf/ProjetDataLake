He was known as Reykjav\u00edk's poet (Reykjav\u00edkursk\u00e1ldi\u00f0, sk\u00e1ld Reykjav\u00edkur). T\u00f3mas's parents were Steinunn \u00deorsteinsd\u00f3ttir and Gu\u00f0mundur \u00d6gmundsson, living at Efri-Br\u00fa in Gr\u00edmsnes. He soon got in touch with literature and poetry. He read Icelandic sagas, J\u00f3nas Hallgr\u00edmsson's poems and more. He also started to write his own poetry at a young age. He moved to Reykjav\u00edk and studied at Menntask\u00f3linn \u00ed Reykjav\u00edk, there he got in touch with many authors, including Halld\u00f3r Laxness (they formed a close friendship during the M.R. years), Gu\u00f0mundur G. Hagal\u00edn and Dav\u00ed\u00f0 Stef\u00e1nsson. T\u00f3mas graduated from M.R. in 1921. He then studied law at H\u00e1sk\u00f3li \u00cdslands and graduated in 1926. During that time he got in touch with even more authors, including J\u00f3n Thoroddsen junior. After his graduation he opened an office to practice law and in 1928 he started working at Hagstofa \u00cdslands. He closed his office in 1929 and quit at the bureau in 1943. From 1943 he was mostly working at poetry and authorship. He was one the editors of Helgafell and N\u00fdja Helgafell, he also translated stories, plays and poems. Tomas died 1983 in Reykjav\u00edk, aged 82. ==Works== T\u00f3mas's poems were mostly traditional and his style did not change much during his career. The poems are mostly about Reykjav\u00edk and his place of youth. The first three books he published, Vi\u00f0 sundin bl\u00e1, Fagra ver\u00f6ld and Stj\u00f6rnur vorsins belong to neoromanticism and so do his last two books, Flj\u00f3ti\u00f0 helga and Heim til \u00fe\u00edn, \u00cdsland, but its signs are not as strong. ==Publications== *1925: Vi\u00f0 sundin bl\u00e1, poems *1933: Fagra ver\u00f6ld, poems *1940: Stj\u00f6rnur vorsins, poems *1950: Flj\u00f3ti\u00f0 helga, poems *1977: Heim til \u00fe\u00edn, \u00cdsland, poems ==References== *Musterissvipurinn mikli - Inngangur a\u00f0 \u00e6vi T\u00f3masar Gu\u00f0mundssonar og greining \u00e1 lj\u00f3\u00f0i hans Vi\u00f0 h\u00f6fnina -. 13 March 2004.
