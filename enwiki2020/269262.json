He was Minister of Public Works in July 2003, when he was detained by the military during a briefly successful coup d'etat led by Major Fernando Pereira. After Prime Minister Patrice Trovoada was defeated in a May 2008 vote of no confidence proposed by the MLSTP/PSD, which was then in opposition, President Fradique de Menezes asked the MLSTP/PSD to form a government in June 2008, and it chose Branco to become the next Prime Minister. Trovoada's Independent Democratic Action (ADI) party denounced Menezes' designation of the MLSTP/PSD to form a government as unconstitutional.\"Partido de PM destitu\u00eddo contra nomea\u00e7\u00e3o de novo Governo s\u00e3o-tomense\", Panapress, June 16, 2008 . ==References== |- Category:1953 births Category:Foreign Ministers of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe Category:Government ministers of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe Category:Living people Category:Movement for the Liberation of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe/Social Democratic Party politicians ",
