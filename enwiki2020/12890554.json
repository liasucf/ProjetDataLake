    "text": "Simplified Wade, abbreviated SW, is a modification of the Wade\u2013Giles romanization system for writing Standard Mandarin Chinese. It was devised by the Swedish linguist Olov Bertil Anderson (1920-1993),Malmqvist (2011: 310). who first published the system in 1969.Anderson (1973). Simplified Wade uses tonal spelling: in other words it modifies the letters in a syllable in order to indicate tone differences. It is one of only two Mandarin romanization systems that indicate tones in such a way (the other being Gwoyeu Romatzyh). All other systems use diacritics or numbers to indicate tone. ==Initials== One of the important changes that Anderson made to Wade\u2013Giles to was to replace the apostrophe following aspirated consonants with an .The IPA also indicates aspiration with a (superscript) h. This modification, previously used in the Legge romanization, was also adopted by Joseph Needham in his Science and Civilisation in China series. The table below illustrates the spelling difference.Anderson (1973). {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !Wade\u2013 Giles !Simplified Wade !H\u00e0ny\u01d4 P\u012bny\u012bn !IPA |- |p |ph |p |p\u02b0 |- |t |th |t |t\u02b0 |- |k |kh |k |k\u02b0 |- |rowspan=2|ch |rowspan=2|chh |q |t\u0255\u02b0 |- |ch |t\u0282\u02b0 |- |ts |rowspan=2|tsh |rowspan=2|c |rowspan=2|ts\u02b0 |- |tz |} While Wade\u2013Giles spells the initials differently before the vowel (written \u016d in WG but y in SW), Simplified Wade spells them the same as everywhere else:Anderson (1973). {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !Wade\u2013 Giles !Simplified Wade |- |tz\u016d but tsu, tsang, etc. |tsy like tsu, tsang, etc. |- |tz\u016d but tsu, tsang, etc. |tshy like tshu, tshang, etc. |- |ss\u016d but su, sang, etc. |sy like su, sang, etc. |} Like most romanization systems for Standard Mandarin, Simplified Wade uses r for Wade\u2013Giles j: WG jih, j\u00ea, j\u00ean, j\u00eang, jo, jui, jung, etc., become SW ry, re, ren, reng, ro, ruei, rung, etc.Anderson (1973). All other initials are the same as in Wade\u2013Giles.Anderson (1973). ==Finals== The finals of Simplified Wade differ from those of Wade\u2013Giles in the following ways:Anderson (1973). * An -h at the end of a Wade\u2013Giles final is dropped in Simplified Wade: WG -ieh, yeh, -\u00fceh, y\u00fceh, \u00earh become SW -ie, ye, -\u00fce (but see below), y\u00fce (but see below), er. * A circumflex in a Wade\u2013Giles final is dropped in Simplified Wade: WG \u00ea, -\u00ean, w\u00ean, -\u00eang, w\u00eang, \u00earh become SW e, -en, wen, -eng, weng, er. * The Wade\u2013Giles \u00ea/o final is always e in Simplified Wade: for Wade\u2013Giles ko, ko, ho; \u00ea or o; t\u00ea, t\u00ea, ch\u00ea, ch\u00ea ts\u00ea, ts\u00ea, j\u00ea, etc., Simplified Wade has ke, khe, he; e; te, the, che, chhe, tse, tshe, re, etc. * The Wade\u2013Giles ui/uei final is always uei in Simplified Wade (except when it forms a syllable on its own; then it is wei in both WG and SW). Wade\u2013Giles writes kuei and kuei but otherwise -ui (hui, shui, jui, etc.), while Simplified Wade writes not only kuei and khuei but also huei, shuei, ruei, etc. * While Wade\u2013Giles writes the syllable as i or yi depending on the character, Simplified Wade consistently uses yi. * Like Gwoyeu Romatzyh, Simplified Wade uses -y for Wade\u2013Giles -ih and -\u016d: WG chih, chih, shih, jih, tz\u016d, tz\u016d, ss\u016d become SW chy, chhy, shy, ry, tsy, tshy, sy. ===Equivalents of Wade\u2013Giles \u00fc=== When \u00fc is available, it is used as in Wade\u2013Giles. Otherwise, the following rules apply: * The Wade\u2013Giles syllable yu becomes you and WG y\u00fc becomes yu: WG yu, y\u00fc, y\u00fceh, y\u00fcan, y\u00fcn become you, yu, yue, yuan, yun (yung remains yung). * Wade\u2013Giles hs\u00fc becomes hsu or hsyu: WG hs\u00fceh becomes hsue or hsyue; WG hs\u00fcan becomes hsuan or hsyuan; WG hs\u00fcn becomes hsun or hsyun; WG hs\u00fc becomes hsu or hsyu. *In all other cases, Wade\u2013Giles \u00fc becomes yu, e.g. nyu, lyue, chyu, chyun, chhyu, chhyue, chhyuan. ==Tones== Both Gwoyeu Romatzyh and Simplified Wade use tonal spelling, but in two very different fashions. In Gwoyeu Romatzyh, the spelling of the tone and the spelling of the final often fuse together: WG -iao has the basic spelling -iau in GR, which becomes -yau in the 2nd tone, -eau in the 3rd tone, -iaw in the 4th tone, and remains -iau in the 1st tone \u2013 hence WG chiao1, chiao2, chiao3, chiao4 become GR jiau, jyau, jeau, jiaw. There are different rules for different cases: WG pin1, pin2, pin3, pin4 become GR pin, pyn, piin, pinn, but WG sui1, sui2, sui3, sui4 become GR suei, swei, soei, suey. In Simplified Wade, on the other hand, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th tones are always indicated by an otherwise silent letter following the final: -v for the 2nd tone, -x for the 3rd tone, and -z for the 4th tone.Anderson (1973). The spelling of the tone and the spelling of the final are always separable from each other. Simplified Wade's tonal spelling is therefore similar to the adding of a digit at the end of the syllable. The 1st tone is always indicated by the absence of a letter following the final.Anderson (1973). Examples: {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !First tone !Second tone !Third tone !Fourth tone |- |ma |mav |max |maz |- |chiao |chiaov |chiaox |chiaoz |- |phin |phinv |phinx |phinz |- |suei |sueiv |sueix |sueiz |} When a vertical apostrophe is used above one or more syllables, any syllable without a vertical apostrophe carries the neutral tone: H\u00e0ny\u01d4 P\u012bny\u012bn l\u00e1i le is la\u030div-le in Simplified Wade.Anderson (1973). == The right apostrophe == A right apostrophe is used to indicate a syllable break in an otherwise ambiguous spelling, e.g. pi\u02bcaox for WG pi1-ao3, freeing up the spelling piaox to unambiguously mean WG piao3.Anderson (1973). Due to the tone letters, this is only needed when the first syllable carries tone 1. == See also == *Wade\u2013Giles *Wade\u2013Giles table *Comparison of Chinese transcription systems *Spelling in Gwoyeu Romatzyh == Notes == == Citations == == Bibliography == * * * ==External links== *A review of Anderson (1970), explaining Simplified Wade with an example Category:Romanization of Chinese ",
