Morrow Hall was built in 1873 as the first permanent building of Arkansas College. In 1871, state leaders narrowed down choices for the potential flagship location of a state college to either Fayetteville or Batesville. Fayetteville and Washington County residents collaboratively offered financial backing to establish the college in Fayetteville, and Batesville ultimately lost the bid. However, Rev. Isaac J. Long, along with others involved with the Presbyterian church, decided to open their own college there soon after, which they named Arkansas College at Batesville. The charter was signed by Governor Ozra Amander Hadley on October 24, 1872. Morrow Hall was the college's first permanent building, occupied in 1873. The Long family led the college until Dr. Paul M. McCain became president of the college in 1952. It was renamed Lyon College in 1994, after the Lyon family of Arkansas. Frank Lyon Sr. served on the board of trustees from 1946 to 1988, including as chairman from 1977 to 1987. Frank Lyon Jr. served on the board for more than 30 years, until his death in 2015. He served as chair of the board for four years. Frank Lyon Jr. and Jane Lyon gave the largest gift in the college's history of $10 million. W. Joseph King became president in July 2017.
