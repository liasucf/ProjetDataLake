She is best known for winning the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2004 with the song \"Antes muerta que sencilla\". ==Biography== Mar\u00eda Isabel was born in Ayamonte, Province of Huelva, Spain. She demonstrated an interest in dancing and singing from a very young age. Her love for singing and dancing took her to the 2004 Spanish Eurojunior competition, which was televised nationally in her native Spain. The purpose of this competition was to select Spain's representative for the relatively new Junior Eurovision Song Contest competition, which began in 2003. ===Eurojunior and Junior Eurovision Song Contest=== Mar\u00eda Isabel won Spain's Eurojunior contest with her single \"Antes muerta que sencilla\" (\"I'd rather be dead than understated\"). Subsequently, she won the second Junior Eurovision Song Contest performing the same song, and setting a record for both largest score (171 points) and largest winning margin (31). This record can be explained in part due to the 2004 contest having the highest number of participants of any Junior Eurovision Song Contest at the time, with eighteen participants (the 2018 Contest had twenty participants.) Her winning margin record was broken by the 2012 winner, Anastasiya Petryk, who won with a 35-point margin. Her largest score record was broken by 2015 Winner, Destiny Chukunyere. Winning at the age of nine years, ten months and 16 days old, she became the youngest person to win the contest to date (a few days younger than the Tolmachevy Sisters, the only other nine year-old winners). Several weeks before winning the festival she released her first album, titled \u00a1No me toques las palmas que me conozco! (\"Don't clap your hands because I know myself\"). This CD included \"Antes muerta que sencilla\", which launched her career in the Spanish show business world, making her a competitor of another Spaniard child star, Melody. ===After Junior Eurovision Song Contest=== Mar\u00eda Isabel in 2007 \"Antes Muerta que Sencilla\" became an instant radio hit in Spain, and was later promoted in Latin America, where Mar\u00eda Isabel's album was released in 2005. Milly Cangiano, a Puerto Rican television show host, made the song's title one of the catchphrases she uses daily during her show. In addition, Mar\u00eda Isabel began her first tour of Latin America and the United States after the album's release. Her song became a chart-topper in Argentina, Colombia, and Puerto Rico, among others. In April 2005, she was interviewed on US nationwide television for the first time, when she was presented on Univision's El Gordo y la Flaca and chatted with hosts Lili Estefan and Ra\u00fal De Molina. Mar\u00eda Isabel continued school, but on weekends and school holidays she would travel throughout Spain giving concerts as well as interviews for the media. She became a regular performer on M\u00e1laga's Tivoli World amusement park. Her second album was titled N\u00famero 2. It includes the songs \"Pues va a ser que no\" and \"En mi jard\u00edn\". These songs are part of the Spanish soundtrack of the Barbie film Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus. Her third album, Capricornio, was released on 21 November 2006 and peaked at number 11 on the Spanish Albums Chart. It is a double disc set which also includes a DVD with all of her videoclips and extras. Her fourth studio album is a collection of songs from the soundtrack of the first movie she starred in, \u00c1ngeles SA. Due to management and release problems, \u00c1ngeles SA entered the Spanish charts at number 35, however it later peaked at number 7, certifying it gold. In 2009 and 2010 she hosted the children's show Los Lunnis on Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola. In November 2009 she released her fifth album, Los Lunnis con Mar\u00eda Isabel, which contained the songs from the show as well as two original tracks. ===Career as an adult=== After a career hiatus in order to finish her studies, Mar\u00eda Isabel returned to music in 2015, eleven years after her debut, with her sixth studio album, Yo Decido. On 29 December 2015, Mar\u00eda Isabel was announced as one of the six candidates to represent Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016. She took part in the televised national final organised by Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola with a song composed by David Santisteban and titled \u201cLa vida s\u00f3lo es una\u201d, the first single from Yo Decido. She came 4th with 68 points. On 5 July 2019, Mar\u00eda Isabel released a single titled \"Tu Mirada\". == Discography == === Albums === {| class=\"wikitable\" !rowspan=\"2\"|Year !rowspan=\"2\"|Information !colspan=\"2\"|Chart positions !rowspan=\"2\"|Sales and certifications |- !width=\"25\"|SPA !width=\"25\"|TUR |----- bgcolor=\"#ebf5ff\" |2004 |\u00a1No me toques las palmas que me conozco! * First studio album * Released: 2 November 2004 * Label: Universal Music Spain (Vale Music) * Format: CD, download |1 |23 | 500.000 (5x Platinum) |- |2005 |N\u00famero 2 * Second studio album * Released: 2 October 2005 * Label: Universal Music Spain (Vale Music) * Formats: CD, digital download |7 | | 300.000 (3x Platinum) |----- bgcolor=\"#ebf5ff\" |2006 |Capricornio * Third studio album * Released: 21 November 2006 * Label: Universal Music Spain (Vale Music) * Formats: CD, digital download |11 | | 80.000 (1x Platinum) |- |2007 |\u00c1ngeles S.A. * Soundtrack * Fourth studio album * Released: 27 November 2007 * Label: Universal Music Spain * Format: CD, digital download |7 | | 100.000 (1x Platinum) |- bgcolor=\"#ebf5ff\" |2009 |Los Lunnis con Mar\u00eda Isabel * Soundtrack with new songs by Mar\u00eda Isabel * Released: November 10 2009 * Label: Universal Music Spain * Format: CD |68 | | |- |2014 |De pie * Released: May 17 2014 * Label: Discol * Format: CD, digital download | | | |- |2015 |Yo decido * Released: November 27 2015 * Label: Nueva Generaci\u00f3n de Artistas * Format: CD, digital download | | | |} === Singles === * 2004: \u201cAntes muerta que sencilla\u201d \u2014 #36 BEL, #8 CH, #6 FR, #1 SP * 2004: \u201c\u00a1No me toques las palmas que me conozco!\u201d \u2014 #2 SP * 2004: \u201cLa vida es bella\u201d \u2014 #8 SP * 2005: \u201cPues va a ser que no\u201d \u2014 #1 SP * 2006: \u201cEn mi jard\u00edn (Hope Has Wings)\u201d \u2014 #6 SP Is Brie Larson's Cover from Barbie & The Magic of Pegasus * 2006: \u201cQui\u00e9n da la vez\u201d \u2014 promo only * 2006: \u201cDe qu\u00e9 vas\u201d \u2014 #56 SP * 2007: \u201cCometas de cristal\u201d \u2014 promo only * 2007: \u201cCuando no est\u00e1s\u201d * 2009: \u201cCosquillitas\u201d * 2015: \u201cLa vida s\u00f3lo es una\u201d * 2019: \u201cTu mirada\u201d ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Film !Role !Notes |- |2007 |\u00c1ngeles S.A. |Mar\u00eda Isabel |Lead Role |- |2009-2010 |Los Lunnis |As herself |TV series |} == References == Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:People from the Province of Huelva Category:Junior Eurovision Song Contest participants Category:Junior Eurovision Song Contest winners Category:Spanish child singers Category:Spanish female singers Category:Andalusian singers Category:21st-century Spanish singers Category:21st-century women singers ",
