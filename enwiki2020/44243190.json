    "text": "The Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e (, )) was a battle for control over Plav and Gusinje fought on 4 December 1879 between the forces of Principality of Montenegro led by Marko Miljanov and local pro-Ottoman forces which included irregulars of the League of Prizren, both commanded by Ali Pasha, the Kaymekam of Gusinje. \"ihnen auf dem Berliner Kongre\u00df als Gebietsabtretung der T\u00fcrkei zugesprochen worden waren, milit\u00e4risch einzunehmen. Die Bewohner des Gebirgstals am oberen Lim verteidigten unter Leitung des Ali Pascha von Gusinje ihre Heimat gegen die Montenegriner. Die historische Schlacht bei Nov\u0161i\u0107e (alb. Nokshiq) vom 4. Dezember 1879 endete mit einem Sieg der Albanischen Liga; die Montenegriner mu\u00dften sich zur\u00fcckziehen.\" The League of Prizren consisted of the local Albanians and Bosniaks from Plav and Gusinje in Scutari Vilayet and irregulars from Kosovo Vilayet. Some of them where Muslims of Montenegrin descent like Husein Bekte\u0161evi\u0107. This battle followed the Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378). It happened because the Ottoman Empire avoided to provide conditions for peaceful cession of Plav and Gusinje to Montenegro, as agreed in the Treaty of Berlin (1878). To straighten their position at Congress of Berlin and later to avoid fulfillment of their obligations from the Treaty of Berlin, the Ottomans unofficially supported the League of Prizren which mobilized the pro-Ottoman irregulars. They easily mobilized 14,000\u201315,000 forces, because Plav and Gusinje were predominantly populated by the pro-Ottoman Muslims and Albanians who opposed this cession to the predominantly Christian populated Montenegro. They paid all the income of their waqif to the chieftains of neighboring Albanian tribes who belonged to the League of Prizren to support them with their forces. The League of Prizren forces gathered in Plav and Gusinje where they were put under the command of the Ottoman kaymakam of Gusinje, Ali Pasha. The Montenegrin forces of four battalions with 4,000\u20136,000 men were positioned along the demarcation line near villages Velika and Murino. Until the end of November 1879 they were under the command of voivode Petrovi\u0107, who strictly respected instructions of the Montenegrin government to employ static and defensive tactics. At the beginning of December 1879 Montenegrin Prince Nicholas appointed Marko Miljanov, instead of Petrovi\u0107. On 4 December 1879 one skirmish in the village Velika evolved into the battle when the Montenegrin forces advanced into Ottoman territory. Two battalions commanded by Miljanov quickly advanced without securing their flanks. The League of Prizren forces ambushed and surrounded them near the village of Nov\u0161i\u0107e. After several hours of fighting additional two Montenegrin battalions commanded by Vukovi\u0107 arrived and released forces under Miljanov from the encirclement and secured their retreat. Both sides suffered significant casualties. About a month later, in the subsequent battle, the Montenegrin forces near Murino near Plav defeated the League of Prizren forces. In 1880 the Ottomans ceded seaport Ulcinj to Montenegro, instead of the two towns of Plav and Gusinje. Since the Ottomans completely lost control over the League of Prizren, they disestablished it and crushed their forces in April 1881. Ali Pasha of Gusinje was promoted by the Ottomans to the position of mutasarr\u0131f of the Sanjak of \u0130pek and awarded the title of beylerbey. After a fierce disagreement with Prince Nikola in 1882, Miljanov decided to retire from public life to his native Medun. In 1912 Montenegro annexed Plav and Gusinje. == Background == ===Treaty of Berlin and League of Prizren=== Ambassador at Istanbul Austen Henry Layard emphasized that Ottomans would be held responsible for the consequences of influx of armed bands into the region of Plav and Gusinje. The Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e followed the Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378), which the Ottomans had lost. The Ottoman Empire had accepted de jure the independence of Montenegro, which received certain territorial gains. According to the Treaty of Berlin the territories of Plav and Gusinje (then part of Scutari Vilayet in the Ottoman Empire) were awarded to Montenegro, in compensation for territories in Herzegovina captured by Montenegro during the war. Until October 1879 the Montenegrin forces were able to march into this territory without any resistance. However, when Montenegrins prepared forces for a military expedition in Plav and Gusinje, the Ottomans intervened with the Great Powers to stop it, in order to avoid eventual conflicts. Diplomacy of Austria-Hungary emphasized that Montenegro would use Plav and Gusinje as a foothold to realize its territorial aspirations toward Metohija. The common interest brought together former enemies, the Ottoman forces of Plav and Gusinje with Albanian irregulars from the Prizren League. The demographic structure of the population of Plav and Gusinje in 1908, which was not significantly different from data in 1878, was researched by Jovan Cviji\u0107: out of 1,785 households, 1,174 belonged to Bosniaks, 401 to Albanians and 210 to Orthodox population. Muslim population of Plav and Gusinje was afraid that they would suffer the same destiny previously experienced by Muslim population of Nik\u0161i\u0107 and Kola\u0161in.: \"To je posebno bilo izra\u017eeno prilikom zauzimana Kola\u0161ina4 i Nik\u0161i\u0107a,5 ali i drugih mjesta.\" The Ottomans were officially intentioned to respect their obligations, however, in reality, they supported the League of Prizren. The Ottoman governor of Scutari sent ammunitions to Gusinje to be distributed to the local population. Thousands of armed irregulars were mobilized by the League of Prizren all over the region and gathered in Plav and Gusinje. The British Ambassador at Istanbul Austen Henry Layard informed his government that the Ottoman Empire did nothing to prevent the influx of armed bands into the region of Gusinje and emphasized that the High Porte would be held responsible for the consequences. Since October 1879 there were numerous skirmishes between the Montenegrin forces and irregulars. ===Velika attacks=== On October 9, 1879, Albanian highlanders attacked the Montenegrins between R\u017eanica and Velika, in Vasojevi\u0107i, and a bloody fight continued into the night. The Montenegrins managed to push the Albanians over the border, and this faintly did aware the Albanians and their several thousand fighters. On November 22, the Albanians attacked a Montenegrin guarding post of 300 men near Velika, after which 4 to 5 Montenegrin battalions were made ready. The Bratono\u017ei\u0107i and Mora\u010dani with yatagans ambushed the Albanians from behind, and cut them, which forced the Albanians to flee; the Montenegrins caught in and slew for two hours. The Albanian death toll was towards 1,000, while the Montenegrins had 85 deaths and 100 wounded, and some 100 horses and plenty of weapons were seized. Among the Albanians, there were many ununiformed Ottoman regulars. == Prelude == === Montenegrin forces === Marko Miljanov, commander of Montenegrin forces in the Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e Until the end of November 1879 the supreme commander of Montenegrin forces, positioned at the demarcation line toward Plav and Gusinje was voivode Bla\u017eo Petrovi\u0107, member of the ruling Petrovi\u0107 dynasty. At the end of November prince Nicholas I of Montenegro removed Petrovi\u0107 from his position with the explanation that his presence on that position was temporary cancelled as unnecessary. The prince appointed Marko Miljanov on the position of commander of this part of Montenegrin forces. Miljanov was appointed as member of the neighboring Ku\u010di tribe, who knew very well the territory of Plav and Gusinje and also the customs of its population. Miljan Vukov Ve\u0161ovi\u0107, an elderly voivode of Vasojevi\u0107i, was appointed as Miljanov's advisor with position in Andrijevica. According to some speculations, the prince knew that an eventual success of this campaign would not bring much glory to the Montenegrin side, while eventual failure could significantly discredit the Montenegrin commanders. That is why the prince removed a member of his dynasty from the commanding position and appointed Miljanov as commander and Ve\u0161ovi\u0107 as his advisor, both being his political enemies. Some authors speculated that Prince Nicholas appointed Marko Miljanov as responsible for the takeover of Plav and Gusinje, knowing that his forces would be attacked by much stronger forces, because Nicholas wanted his political enemy Miljanov dead. Miljanov was very enthusiastic with the opportunity to capture Plav and Gusinje. He was convinced that he was going to punish Ali Bey of Gusinje for his misdeeds. Ve\u0161ovi\u0107 advised him to be very careful, otherwise Ali Bey might be promoted to Ali Pasha (which eventually happened). The Montenegrin forces were organized along tribal lines. After the war with Ottomans Montenegro had demobilized part of its forces, expecting a peaceful takeover of the areas of Plav and Gusinje. Also Montenegro was short of food for larger number of soldiers due to the drought of 1879. The Montenegrin forces that participated in this battle were composed of four battalions. Two battalions of Ku\u010di and Bratono\u017ei\u0107i tribes were under direct command of Miljanov and positioned in Andrijevica, along the demarcation line near village Murino. Two Vasojevi\u0107i battalions (Mora\u010dko- Rova\u010dki and Ljevore\u010dki) were commanded by Todor Miljanov Vukovi\u0107 and positioned in Berane along the demarcation line near the village of Velika. They all had between 4,000 and 6,000 men (out of whom one thousand did not directly participate in the battle). === Prizren League and other Pro-Ottoman forces === Picture of Ali Pasha (sitting, first from the left) with Haxhi Zeka (sitting in the middle) and some other members of Prizren League In the Autumn of 1879 notables of Plav and Gusinje established the Committee of National Salvation. The first order of the Committee was to send Jakup Ferovi\u0107 to visit neighboring Albanian tribes to offer them an alliance. It was also decided that Ferovi\u0107 will carry all income of Plav vaqif to pay to Albanian chieftains to accept this alliance.: \"Prva odluka novoformiranog Komiteta odnosila se na slanje Jakupa Ferovi\u0107a me\u0111u susjedna albanska plemena da ih obavijesti o opasnostima koje su se nadvile nad Plavom i Gusinjem, o odluci naroda ovih karajeva da brane ove domove i da se albanskim prvacima u ime gra\u0111ana ovih krajeva ponudi savez o zajedni\u010dkoj odbrani, prihvataju\u0107i smje\u0161taj i ishranu njihovih dobrovoljaca. Uz to, odlu\u010deno je da Jakup Ferovi\u0107 ponese sa sobom sva raspolo\u017eiva nov\u010dana sredstva plavskog vakufa koja su se odnosila na sakupljene prihode po osnovu kori\u0161tenja ispa\u0161e na plavskim planinama, koja su bila dosta zna\u010dajna, te da sa ovim sredstvima nagradi albanske prvake kako bi ih lak\u0161e privolio da prihvate ovu saradnju.\" Against the orders of Ali Bey prepared 12-15 kilometers long and 2 meters wide trenches.: \"Ali-pa\u0161a \u0160abanagi\u0107 je naredio da se u du\u017eini od 12-15 km izpravca sjever-jug, od Vrmo\u0161e do Kr\u0161le (iza Gusinja), gdje je bilo sjedi\u0161te kajmakama, iskopa odbrambeni rov \u0161irine oko 2 metra, koji se kontinuirano prostirao \u010ditavim pravcem. \" The pro-Ottoman forces of 2,100 were gathered in Gusinje and put under command of the Ottoman kaymakam of Gusinje, Ali Bey of Gusinje (later known as Ali Pasha of Gusinje). Notable commanders of the pro-Ottoman forces include Haxhi Mulla Jaha (Jahja efendi Musi\u0107), Jakup Ferri (Ferovi\u0107), Husein-beg Red\u017eepagi\u0107. Numerous pro- Ottoman forces were mobilized by the Prizren League. The Ottoman military officer Muhtar Pasha arrived to Prizren in November 1879. He had 15 battalions of Ottoman soldiers there. The Ottomans informed Montenegrins that this forces would be used to provide peaceful takeover of Plav and Gusinje by Montenegro. Montenegro complained to Great Powers and accused Ottomans that their actions contradict to their promises because Ottoman forces under Muhtar Pasha were used not for peaceful cession of Plav and Gusinje to Montenegro. Instead they were used to organize and support irregulars in their actions against Montenegro. There are different estimations about the composition of the Ottoman forces, regarding the eventual presence of the officers and soldiers of regular Ottoman army and regarding their ethnic composition. Overall Ali Pasha had mobilized some 10,000-20,000 Albanian men. The Montenegrin side emphasized that Muhtar Pasha secretly commanded pro-Ottoman forces which included many regular Ottoman soldiers (nizams) disguised as irregulars by wearing Albanian costumes. They also emphasized that pro-Ottoman irregulars were commanded by the officers of the regular Ottoman army who extensively used bugles during the battle, which did not exist in Albanian military tradition. The Albanian sources on this battle over-emphasized participation of Albanians in it without mentioning many non-Albanian Muslims that participated on the pro-Ottoman side. On the other hand, the Muslims from Plav and Gusinje do not even mention Prizren league in their traditional epic poetry on this battle, but only different tribes and their thirty bayraktars with Albanian language being mother tongue of three out of thirty bayraktars. Some recent works of Bosnian historiography emphasize that participation of Bosniaks from Plav and Gusinje in this battle was neglected without real justification. == Battle == View of Velika in 2012 The battle evolved from one skirmish of 4 December 1879 that was similar to many other taking place in this region since October of the same year. On that day a detachment of the pro-Ottoman irregulars attacked Montenegrin guards in the village Velika and forced them to retreat. Two Vasojevi\u0107i battalions commanded by Todor Miljanov Vukovi\u0107 pushed the attackers back and chased them across the demarcation line, towards Plav. Although the Montenegrin forces were ordered to employ the defensive tactics in case of the conflict, Miljanov decided to use this incursion of Montenegrin forces under Vukovi\u0107 and on the same day crossed the demarcation line advancing with two battalions (of Ku\u010di and Bratono\u017ei\u0107i) into the territory of Plav. They crossed the bridge over river Lim south of the village Murino and quickly advanced toward Plav and Gusinje along the river Lim. Initially, the Montenegrin forces advanced undisturbed, which led them to conclusion that they were not expected or that the pro-Ottoman forces were not well organized, so they left their flanks unsecured. When they reached the narrow part of the valley surrounded by high hills near the village of Nov\u0161i\u0107e, the pro-Ottoman forces attacked them. Without secured flanks the Montenegrin forces soon found themselves surrounded and stuck in the deep snow. For hours they repelled numerous attacks while both sides suffered heavy casualties. Prominent commanders of the pro-Ottoman forces Jakup Ferri and Omer Ba\u0161ulovi\u0107, the bajraktar of Plav, were killed at the beginning of the battle. Arif Ba\u0161i\u0107, another commander of the pro-Ottoman forces from Plav, also died in this battle. The pro-Ottoman forces from Plav were initially forced to retreat until around 600 fighters from Rugova attacked Montenegrin flanks from the direction of Je\u010dmi\u0161te. In the evening of 4 December two Vasojevi\u0107i Montenegrin battalions (Mora\u010dko-Rova\u010dki and Ljevore\u010dki) commanded by Todor Miljanov Vukovi\u0107 reached the battlefield in Nov\u0161i\u0107i and released surrendered forces of Miljanov securing their retreat. Pavle Rovinski reported that 109 Montenegrin soldiers were killed and 115 wounded in this battle. The forces under command of Vukovi\u0107 did not suffer significant casualties. The casualties of the pro-Ottoman side were around 250 men. The forces of Ali Pasha defeated Montenegrin troops in the Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e with his forces bringing back some sixty heads to Gusinje. Some sources say that the Ottoman irregulars beheaded 220 Montenegrin soldiers and for six months kept their heads impaled on the sticks. == Aftermath == === Battle of Murino === View of Murino in 2011 About a month after the battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e, on 8 January 1880 the pro-Ottoman irregulars attacked Montenegrin forces at the village of Murino, but were defeated and pushed back toward Plav. According to the Montenegrin Prince Nicholas, the defeat of retreating Ottoman forces was so devastating, that Montenegrin forces finished the battle before the night had fallen, which is something that doesn't happen. The Albanian irregulars burned down several villages (among which (Velika, R\u017eanica and Pepi\u0107), which belonged to the Vasojevi\u0107i clan. This battle was considered as Montenegrin revenge for their defeat in the Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e. Right after the Battle of Murino Marko Miljanov received a report that Albanians are boasting for keeping Plav and Gusinje, not for the battles they fought with the Montenegrins. Some reports say that Montenegrin soldiers brought 221 noses they cut from the dead bodies of irregulars. === Outcome and significance === After the Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e Ahmed Muhtar Pasha invited population of Plav and Gusinje to accept peaceful cession to Montenegro The Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e was not very significant from the military point of view. If it had happened during the Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378), it would probably have remained hardly noticed. The contemporary circumstances resulted with its significant political consequences. The main consequences of the Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e were strengthening of the positions of the League of Prizren and losing any chance for Montenegrins to soon capture Plav and Gusinje. The battle cast a certain shadow on the exceptional Montenegrin military reputation, gave some confidence to Albanians and significantly affected the position of prince Nicholas and his government. Both parties claimed victory after this battle, underestimating own casualties and overestimating enemy casualties. The Montenegrin government tried to conceal the military defeat and published information about 85 killed and 107 wounded Montenegrins as opposed to 1,000 killed and wounded enemy soldiers. The Ottoman sultan promoted Ali Bey to higher military rank (beylerbey) and awarded him with enough money to build a mosque in Plav, the Sultanija. Only after the Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e the Ottoman governor Ahmed Muhtar Pasha issued a proclamation to the population of Plav and Gusinje instructing them to accept a peaceful cession to Montenegro. Since this was proven impossible without bloodbath, the Ottoman Empire ceded Ulcinj to Montenegro in 1880 as compensation for Plav and Gusinje. Soon the Ottomans completely lost control over the League of Prizren which fell under the influence of pro-Austrian Albanian nationalists, so the Ottomans had to defeat the irregulars of the league in April 1881. The Ottoman state gave Ali Pasha forestland for his defense of Gusinje against the Montenegrins and later he sent some Albanian youths from the region for training and service in the place guard of sultan Abdulhamid II. In 1881 the Ottomans promoted Ali Pasha to the position of mutasarr\u0131f of the Sanjak of \u0130pek. Plav and Gusinje remained in the Ottoman Empire until 1912/1913 when they were occupied and annexed by Montenegro. == Legacy == This battle inspired poets of both sides that participated in it. The Ottomans made up a mockery song. The poetry of Muslims include description of the horse of Jakup Ferovi\u0107 that ran through the battlefield after the death of his master. Albanian epic poem The Highland Lute, written in 1937, mentions this battle and Jakup Ferri. There are several poems about this battle composed by the Vasojevi\u0107i tribe. Pavel Rovinski, who was a medic in the Montenegrin army, decided to publish (in 1902) a song \"The Battles in Polimlje\" (), based on the singing of Muslim gusle player Osman Abdulah descending from the Ku\u010di tribe. According to this song the pro-Ottoman forces included many neighbouring Albanian tribes led by their bayraktars. The Krasniqi by Man Avdija, Gashi by Ali-Ibro, tribes from Dukagjini by Mustafa bayraktar, tribes from Pe\u0107 by Mahmudbegovi\u0107, from Gjakova by Saitbegovi\u0107 and some by Salih-Agha. According to the legend, before the battle began advancing Montenegrin forces noticed gusle player Osman Abdulah spying on them, so they captured him. When he explained that he just wanted to personally witness the battle so he could make song about it, Miljanov ordered his release. On 12 August 2014 in the village Gornja R\u017eanica near Plav a monument was erected in honor of the Montenegrin soldiers killed in this battle. == References == == Sources == * * * * * * Category:Principality of Montenegro Category:Conflicts in 1879 Category:Battles involving Montenegro Category:19th-century military history of Montenegro Category:1879 in the Ottoman Empire Category:Scutari Vilayet Category:Plav, Montenegro Category:Ottoman period in the history of Montenegro Category:19th century in Albania Category:Battles involving Albania Category:December 1879 events ",
