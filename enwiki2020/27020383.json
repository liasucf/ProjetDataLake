    "text": "Samuel \"Sammy\" James Morfitt (10 December 1868 \u2013 16 January 1954) was an English rugby union and rugby league footballer who played in the 1880s and 1890s. He played representative level rugby union (RU) for England, Yorkshire and Durham, and at club level for Hull FC, Hull Kingston Rovers (two spells), and West Hartlepool, as a wing, or centre, i.e. number 11 or 14, or 12 or 13, and club level rugby league (RL) for Hull Kingston Rovers (Heritage \u2116). Prior to the 1895\u201396 season, Hull F.C. was a rugby union club, and prior to the 1897\u201398 season, Hull Kingston Rovers was a rugby union club. ==Background== Sammy Morfitt was born in Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, his birth was registered in Sculcoates district, and he died aged 85 in Kingston upon Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, England. ==Playing career== ===International honours=== Morfitt won caps for England (RU) while at West Hartlepool in 1894 against Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, and while at Hull Kingston Rovers in 1896 against Wales, Ireland, and Scotland. In the early years of rugby football the goal was to score goals, and a try had zero value, but it provided the opportunity to try at goal, and convert the try to a goal with an unopposed kick at the goal posts. The point values of both the try and goal have varied over time, and in the early years footballers could \"score\" a try, without scoring any points. ===Change of Code=== When Hull Kingston Rovers converted from the rugby union code to the rugby league code for the 1897/98 season, Sammy Morfitt would have been approximately 28 years of age. Consequently, he was both a rugby union and rugby league footballer for Hull Kingston Rovers. ==Note== Sammy Morfitt's surname is variously spelt correctly with a 'o' as Morfitt, or incorrectly with a 'u' as Murfitt. ==References== ==External links== *Search for \"Morfitt\" at rugbyleagueproject.org *Search for \"Murfitt\" at rugbyleagueproject.org * (archived by web.archive.org) England versus Wales - Lockwood's Game *Search for \"Samuel Morfitt\" at britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk *Search for \"Sammy Morfitt\" at britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk *Search for \"Samuel Murfitt\" at britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk *Search for \"Sammy Murfitt\" at britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk Category:1868 births Category:1954 deaths Category:Durham County RFU players Category:England international rugby union players Category:English rugby league players Category:English rugby union players Category:Hull F.C. players Category:Hull Kingston Rovers players Category:Rugby union centres Category:Rugby union wings Category:Sportspeople from Kingston upon Hull Category:West Hartlepool R.F.C. players Category:Yorkshire County RFU players ",
