    "text": "Halal-TV was a Swedish television show, based on the Dutch show De Meiden van Halal. The program was hosted by three Swedish muslim women who interviewed members of the public on a wide range of subjects through an islamic lens. The show's run consisted of seven episodes and a special debate episode. The program was broadcast on SVT2 in the fall of 2008. The program sparked controversy before the first episode had been broadcast. Cherin Awad, one of the hosts, had made a statement in the show Existens five years earlier which some interpreted as her condoning stoning because of sexual infidelity. Another controversy emerged when author Carl Hamilton appeared for an interview and insisted on shaking the presenter's hands. Two of the hosts refused, as it would have violated their religious beliefs. This sparked a heated discussion between Hamilton and the hosts which was later published by SVT. ==Episodes== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Episode !Date !Subject !Guests |- |1 |2008-11-03 |The Class Society |Carl Hamilton, Mona Sahlin |- |2 |2008-11-10 |Equality |Nyamko Sabuni |- |3 |2008-11-17 |Beauty ideals |Bingo Rim\u00e9r, Louise Bratt, Isabella L\u00f6wengrip |- |4 |2008-11-24 |Alcohol |Leif Silbersky, Maria Larsson |- |5 |2008-12-01 |Sex |Charlotta Levay |- |6 |2008-12-08 |The Cost of Immigration |Jimmie \u00c5kesson, Tobias Billstr\u00f6m |- |7 |2008-12-15 |Sports as a Religion |Kutte J\u00f6nsson, Petter Karlsson |} ==References== Category:Sveriges Television original programming ",
