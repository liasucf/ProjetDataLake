Most notably, he has worked on soundtracks of various Dragon Ball video games. Yamamoto has also composed background music for Dragon Ball Z Kai, a revamped version of the anime series Dragon Ball Z. On March 9, 2011, Toei Animation publicly acknowledged that many of Yamamoto's musical works for the series infringed upon unidentified third-party copyrights. As a result, Toei removed Yamamoto and replaced his compositions with those from the original Dragon Ball Z series written by Shunsuke Kikuchi. The plagiarism of these works have been known to fans since May 2010. Due to the discovery of plagiarism in his compositions by Toei, they were replaced in Dragon Ball Z: Budokai HD Collection and later copies of Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2. {| class=\"wikitable\" |-Songs !
