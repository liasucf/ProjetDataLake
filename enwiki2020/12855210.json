    "text": "Nanisivik Mine was a zinc-lead mine in the company town of Nanisivik, Nunavut, north of the Arctic Circle on Baffin Island. It was Canada's first mine in the Arctic. The mine first opened on 15 October 1976 and permanently closed in September 2002 due to low metal prices and declining resources. Mine reclamation began in April 2003. It was one of the most northerly mines in the world. The mine was served by a port and dock located about 2.7 km (1.6 mi) north. It was used for shipping concentrate from the site, and receiving supplies. It is currently used by the Canadian Coast Guard for training. The mine also had its own airport (Nanisivik Airport) located about southwest and was the main airport for Arctic Bay, until they expanded their own airport. The airport is about directly southeast of Arctic Bay but the road between them is .Arctic Bay and Nanisivik Nanisivik zinc-lead ore ==See also== *Nanisivik Naval Facility *Polaris mine *El Toqui mine *El Mochito mine ==References== Category:Mines in Nunavut Category:Lead mines in Canada Category:Zinc mines in Canada Category:Baffin Island Category:Former mines in Canada Category:Former populated places in the Qikiqtaaluk Region Category:Former populated places in Arctic Canada ",
