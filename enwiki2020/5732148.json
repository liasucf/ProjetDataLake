    "text": "Saint Martin of Leon (; c. 1130 - January 12, 1203) was a priest and canon regular of the Augustinian Order. Born at Le\u00f3n, Martin, along with his father Juan, withdrew from the world to the canonry of St. Marcellinus in Le\u00f3n after the death of his mother. Martin was educated at this canonry, and after the death of his father, Martin decided to undertake a major pilgrimage, visiting the cities of Rome and Constantinople. Returning to Spain, he took the religious habit at St. Marcellinus, but after seeing this monastery had been secularized by the bishops he entered the collegiate of church St. Isidore in the same city. This is a church he went on to endow and is where Saint Isidore was buried, hence its name. Martin distinguished himself by his zealous observance, his charity, and his deep devotion to the Blessed Sacrament. The date of his death is given to us by the necrology preserved in the monastery. He died on January 12, 1203 of natural causes. The religious of St. Isidore's dedicated a chapel to Martin very early and celebrated his feast each year. == Works == Martin wrote commentaries on different Epistles and the Apocalypse, and he left numerous discourses on the many varied subjects. His complete works were published first by Espinosa (Seville, 1782), Migne in Patrologia Latina, LXXXI, 53-64, CCVIII, CCIX (Paris, 1855). == External links == * Augustinian Canons: Blessed Martin of Leon * Martin of Leon at the Catholic Encyclopedia Category:1130s births Category:1203 deaths Category:People from Le\u00f3n, Spain Category:Augustinian canons Category:Medieval Spanish saints Category:13th-century Christian saints ",
