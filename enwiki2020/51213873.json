    "text": "SuperMeat is an Israeli startup company working to develop a \"meal-ready\" chicken cultured meat product created through the use of cell culture. The company, which is crowdfunded through Indiegogo, claims that their product is more environmentally sound than conventional meat production as well as more economic, and involves no animal slaughter. In January 2018, SuperMeat announced a $3M seed funding round by New Crop Capital and Stray Dog Capital, as well as a strategic partnership with PHW, one of Europe\u2019s largest poultry producers. In May 2020, it was reported that SuperMeat planned to bring its cultured poultry to the market by 2022, aiming to sell at prices similar to slaughtered poultry products. ==References== Category:Cellular agriculture Category:Food and drink companies of Israel Category:Meat industry Category:Indiegogo projects Category:Biotechnology companies of Israel ",
