    "text": "David Isberg (born 23 February 1975) is a Swedish musician, most famous for having founded seminal Swedish progressive death metal band Opeth. David Isberg is also known as DJ Dake, having a successful DJ career with independent and electronic music, often influenced by the Madchester & obscure 70srock and psychedelic music. He also DJs old school heavy, thrash, speed and death metal. ==Before Opeth== Starting early with a band he called Satanic Slaughter, which he renamed as soon as he heard about another band from Sweden with the same name and demos out to Casket. Casket played two live shows. David appeared in the grindcore band Dr. Deaths Armageddon playing a few shows and releasing 1 live cassette and one rehearsal demo. David was in the Swedish death/black metal band Procreation (1989\u20131991). In Procreation, he used the alias of The Unholy Emperor. Alongside David was Christofer Johnsson, the man most known for being the frontman of the band Therion, using the name Necro. Procreation made two demo tapes (\"Enter the Land of the Dark Forgotten Souls of Eternity\" 1991 and \"Procreation of the Antichrist\" 1990, along with two live shows (both at Hunddagis, Handen 1 held in 1989 or 1990 (the year is not confirmed) and the second show being held on 23 February 1991 (to celebrate David's 16th birthday) with various Therion members filling in on the empty slots. ==Opeth== David formed Opeth with some friends from T\u00e4by in the Spring of 1990. Long-time friend Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt was in a band called Eruption, but was considering a departure from this group. David invited him to play bass for Opeth and \u00c5kerfeldt accepted the offer. When he came to the rehearsal, however, none of the other members of the band knew Mikael was coming and they did not want to kick out the bass player they already had. The ensuing argument played out with all the members of Opeth (aside from David) leaving. They renamed themselves Crowley and released a demo tape called \"The Gate\" in 1991. David remained with Opeth until 1992 when he left citing creative differences. His duties as a lead singer were taken up by \u00c5kerfeldt. ==After Opeth== David Isberg continued his musical career with electronic project Grooveza (later Grooveza/Fuzz), death metal band Mynjun, and later to be found in experimental death metal band David Isberg & The Stockholm War Ensemble as well as Stockholm Death Metal band Tutorial together with Adam Skogvards of Mynjun. David was also active in extreme blues maniacs Dubplate Connection, which released their debut album Plays and Sings the Blues in 2009. They performed shows in Sweden and the U.S.A. to support the album. The other three members of Dubplate Connection are M\u00e5rten Tiljander, Linus Dielemans, and the mysterious Southside Slim. David left the band ahead of the North American tour and once again started to play with his old colleagues from Mynjun under the monicker of Tutorial & later somn. By 2009, David was active in at least two extreme metal bands Braathum (named after an ancient mansion in David's possession) and the restarted version of Mynjun named Tutorial and later somn. There are also rumors that he is about to finish lyrical works that for around seven to eight years he has been working on writing. (book released July 2017). In the year 2009, David graduated as a professional Sommelier at Vink\u00e4llan Wine School in Stockholm. Since 2015 he has worked with wine imports and presents lectures and tastings professionally. In the summer of 2018 he was hired as a resident taste-leader at a local craft brewery named Fj\u00e4derholmarnas Bryggeri. He used to run a podcast with metal musicians, being beer geeks and other interesting persons named \"The Death Metal Sommelier & the nerds of the beast\" and performs his special spoken word performances \"death metal poetry\" reading from his debut book \"Ornament of the Ominous Demoniac - the coagulated blood of David\" released in 325 copies in July 2017 and his up and coming works as well as work in the Swedish wine industry and occasionally still deejays at mostly metal shows and bars like the Stockholm Extreme Metal Club Fredagsmangel. He also runs his blog site, http://thunderdoomsociety.com ==bloodofjupiter== Since 2011 David renamed his band bloodofjupiterurl=http://bloodofjupiter.com after his interest in astronomy and wine (the name refers to Tuscan grape Sangiovese in an astrophysical occult way of spelling putting the three words into one). The band released various rehearsal demos and a live recording (also to be released on cassette in 2019)on the internet. At Halloween 2020 the band will release their debut album \"Eternal Damnation\" recorded at Studio Humbucker in February and April 2020.
