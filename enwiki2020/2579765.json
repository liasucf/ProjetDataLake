    "text": "Yes\u00fc M\u00f6ngke (died 1252) was head of the ulus of the Chagatai Khanate (1246 or 1247-1252). He was the son of Chagatai Khan. In or around 1246, he was appointed as khan of the Chagatai Khanate by his cousin the Great Khan G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan, whom he was friends with, following the deposition of Qara H\u00fcl\u00ebg\u00fc. The next Great Khan, however, M\u00f6ngke Khan, initiated a purge of the supporters of the house of \u00d6gedei Khan, amongst which were the Chaghadaids. Yes\u00fc M\u00f6ngke and the Chaghadaid prince B\u00fcri were both exiled by M\u00f6ngke to the camp of Batu Khan of the Blue Horde, who executed them. Qara H\u00fcl\u00ebg\u00fc was then restored to his former position.
