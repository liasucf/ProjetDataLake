Moore, led Thomas Merton to the Roman Catholic Church. Twice silenced by Cardinal Francis Spellman. Close friend of Eleanor Roosevelt and Carlton J. H. Hayes. Dr. Henry P. Van Dusen, then president of Union Theological Seminary next to Corpus Christi, described Father Ford as \"the best known and best loved man in the Morningside Heights community\".Cogley, John. \"A Priest in the City, The Commonweal, 1948, p. 9.

Also helped establish the Church Peace Union that today is the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs (New York Times obituary). Ford was a disciple of educational reformer John Dewey, who was a professor at Columbia's Teacher's College, and he eventually received the John Dewey Award. In 1938, Thomas Merton sought Ford out at Corpus Christi Church to seek instruction in the Catholic faith.Merton, Thomas. The Seven Storey Mountain. Harcourt Brace, 1948, p. 237.Ford, George Barry. A Degree of Difference. Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1969, pp. 79-80. That same year, when Servant of God Catherine Doherty, Baroness de Hueck, arrived in New York, he gave her free rent in Harlem, which was a key to her success in establishing Friendship House that became a key center of the future Madonna House Apostolate. He also contributed frequently to her support.\"Merton 1948, p. 373\" In 1954 he received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) degree from Columbia University.Columbia University Library He also received honorary degrees from Manhattan College and Seton Hall College. In 1966 he served on the historic Ad hoc Commission on Rights of Soviet Jews. It was chaired by Bayard Rustin, and established by the Conference on the Status of Soviet Jews, offering a public tribunal on Jewish life in the Soviet Union. Fr. Ford is thanked in the liner notes to George Carlin's 1972 album Class Clown, for although Carlin rejected the Catholic faith, he remembered Ford with cultural appreciation, and credited him for teaching him how to ask questions and think.Sullivan, James.
