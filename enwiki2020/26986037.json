    "text": "Slammiversary VIII was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), which took place on June 13, 2010 at the TNA Impact! Zone in Orlando, Florida. It was the sixth event under the Slammiversary chronology. This was the first time since 2006 that Slammiversary was held at the Impact! Zone, and the first time that a King of the Mountain match didn't take place. The main event was between Rob Van Dam and Sting for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in which Van Dam retain his title. Matches on the undercard featured The Enigmatic Assholes (Jeff Hardy and Mr. Anderson) defeated Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode) in a tag team match, Jay Lethal defeated A.J. Styles, and Abyss defeated Desmond Wolfe in a Monster's Ball match. The event saw the TNA debut of Tommy Dreamer, during the event. In October 2017, with the launch of the Global Wrestling Network, the event became available to stream on demand. ==Storylines== Slammiversary VIII featured nine professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers are portrayed as villains, heroes or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that build tension and culminate into a wrestling match or series of matches. On the May 20 edition of TNA Impact! Sting was ranked number one in the first Top 10 ranking by the TNA Championship Committee and was as a result given a shot at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Slammiversary. On June 10, Dixie Carter said on Twitter she would have a big surprise at Slammiversary that would ultimately change TNA forever. Also using Twitter, she later clarified her statement to indicate that while there will be a surprise revealed at Slammiversary, it will not be the one said to \"change TNA forever,\" which will instead be revealed in the coming weeks. It was soon known that Tommy Dreamer was the surprise after making his debut at the TNA Wrestling Pay-per-view event. ==Results== ==References== ==External links== *TNA Wrestling.com *Slammiversary.com Slammiversary (2010) Category:2010 in Florida Category:Events in Orlando, Florida Category:Professional wrestling in Orlando, Florida Category:June 2010 events in the United States Category:2010 Total Nonstop Action Wrestling pay-per-view events ",
