ABL \u2013 Biography for Assis Chateaubriand == Early life == Chateaubriand was born in Umbuzeiro, state of Para\u00edba, in the Northeast of Brazil, on October 4, 1892. ==Career== From a meager and troublesome youth in the northeast of Brazil \u2013 he only learned how to read at the age of 10 \u2013 Chateaubriand followed the trail of a self-made man into a position of quasi monopoly in Brazilian press. Chateaubriand began as a journalist at the age of 15, working for the newspaper Gazeta do Norte. He also wrote for Jornal Pequeno and Di\u00e1rio de Pernambuco. In 1917, having moved to Rio de Janeiro, he worked for Correio da Manh\u00e3. In this newspaper, he would publish his impressions about his trip to Europe, in 1920. In the state of Pernambuco, as a young lawyer, he rapidly grew to fame through a series of verbal clashes, or polemics, with political and literary figures. At the same time, he managed, still in his twenties, to become Professor of Roman Law at the Law Faculty of Recife, after a hard-fought examination, being formally appointed for the post only after various clashes with the state's politicos, among them General Dantas Barreto and Dr. Manuel Borba. During his struggle he made powerful friends and allies in Rio de Janeiro. What finally settled the battle was a telegram from the president of the republic, Venceslau Br\u00e1s, on December 8, 1915. His victory in attaining the position as professor further became a platform for his even more ambitious goal; to own a newspaper of his own by the age of thirty. In 1924, Chat\u00f4 became the director of O Jornal. This was his first step toward building his press empire, to which were added important newspapers from Brazil, such as Di\u00e1rio de Pernambuco (the oldest newspaper in Latin America) and Jornal do Commercio (the oldest newspaper in Rio de Janeiro). In the following year, a newspaper from S\u00e3o Paulo was added to his press conglomerate: Di\u00e1rio da Noite. In 1929, Chateaubriand added to Di\u00e1rios Associados another newspaper: Estado de Minas, now the most famous, influent and respected of that conglomerate. Intelligent, learned, hard-headed and stubborn, he soon earned a reputation as a self-made man, who had no scruples about approaching and lobbying for influential people who might be serviceable to his personal interests; already as a teenager, he had already made friends with the powerful local Lundgren family of industrialists.Bernardo Kucinski, \"Chat\u00f4: o poder da chantagem\" In A S\u00edndrome da Antena Parab\u00f3lica, S\u00e3o Paulo: Perseu Abramo, 1998, , page166 After moving to Rio, Chateaubriand worked as a journalist and lawyer, and it was in the latter capacity that he made friends with influential people, especially magnates connected with the interests of foreign corporations who wanted to hedge through lobbying against nationalist politics, among them the public utilities trust Light & Co's CEO Alexander McKenzie and the American mining magnate Percival Farquhar.Kucinski, \"Chat\u00f4\", 166 Chateaubriand was a media mogul in Brazil between the late 1930s and the early 1960s and the owner of Di\u00e1rios Associados, a conglomerate that counted at its peak more than a hundred newspapers, radio and TV stations, magazines and a telegraphic agency. He is also known as the co-creator and founder, in 1947, of the S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Art (MASP),History of MASP (The Arts Museum of S\u00e3o Paulo) together with Pietro Maria Bardi. On September 25, 1935, Chateaubriand inaugurated R\u00e1dio Tupi (pt) in a ceremony attended by the inventor of radio Guglielmo Marconi, who, ten days earlier, had broadcast the first musical program with a 120-voice orchestra that sang the Brazilian National Anthem and was conducted by conductor Villa-Lobos. In its beginning, the station was known as \"Cacique do Ar\", also being called by its prefix PRG-3 or, simply, G-3. Chateubriand also founded the first television network of Latin America and the fifth in the world (Tupi TV).

Chateaubriand never made a great secret about his peculiar business strategies: \"excellency in business means buying without money\" he once allegedly said.Cf. He died on April 4, 1968, in S\u00e3o Paulo. == Historical influence == An often polemic and controversial figure, hated and feared, Chateaubriand has also been nicknamed \"the Brazilian Citizen Kane\" \u2013 LIMA, Ana Paula Pereira.

Regarded by some as having formed the basis for a modern Brazilian press and mass culture, Francisco de Assis Chateaubriand Bandeira de Melo's power over the Brazilian media \u2013 as well as his lack of scruples, his upstart drive and gangster-like ethosKucinski, \"Chat\u00f4\", 167 \u2013 during his height from the 1920s and well into the '60s can be compared to that of William Randolph Hearst in the USA. Chateaubriand was one of the most influential individuals in Brazilian history. He was known for having strong ties to the current leaders within both politics and economy. With a career as solicitor, journalist, media mogul, ambassador and senator, he often was the decisive drop on the scale of political campaigns and decisions. He was part of the creation of presidents and the undisputed ruler of Brazilian press. At the same time, he always lacked a clear ideological agenda \u2013 except for being a staunch partisan of the untrammeled Free Market and of consented submission to imperialist interests. At the end of his life \u2013 especially after a stroke in 1960, that left him speechless, using a wheelchair and communicating with others mostly by means of notes typed in a specially adapted typewriter \u2013 he had become a clownish shadow of himself, \"a blackmailer who acted as an interloper in the power game of the ruling class\". His media empire, after decades of personal financial mismanagement, quickly declined after his death. In the new ambience of a modernized Brazil, he was quickly dislocated by the new professionally managed, streamlined and more ideologically coherent Rede Globo.Kucinski, \"Chat\u00f4\", 167/168 ==References== ==Books== * Morais, Fernando (1994).
