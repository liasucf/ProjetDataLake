Apprentice of Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola, he was active in Emilia and in Rome, where he had been living in the rione of Borgo, in the road still bearing his name (Via del Mascherino). He was the architect of the Quirinal Palace under Pope Gregory XIII. His other works include the churches of San Salvatore in Lauro (1591), Santa Maria in Transpontina, the Bandini Chapel in San Silvestro al Quirinale, and the oval plan-design for the church of Santo Spirito in Sassia. He died in Rome in 1606. ==References== * * Category:1536 births Category:1606 deaths Category:16th-century Italian architects Category:Architects from Bologna Category:Artists from Bologna ",
