The department was created by Prime Minister Theresa May, shortly after she took office on 13 July 2016, following the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union. DIT's purpose is to develop, coordinate and deliver a new trade policy for the United Kingdom, including preparing for and then negotiating free trade agreements and market access deals with non-EU countries. The new department is a specialised body with significant new trade negotiating capacity. It took on the responsibilities of UK Trade and Investment, which was previously operated by both the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for Business Innovation and Skills, it also took on the latter's other relevant trade functions; as well as responsibility for UK Export Finance. It is overseen by the Secretary of State for International Trade, currently Liz Truss. the department employed about 200 trade negotiators.Trading places / Negotiating post-Brexit deals. Economist, February 4th-10th 2017, page 25 The UK Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) was set up to protect Britain from unfair global trading practices after Britain left the EU. It was intended to be a separate department, but continued to be a \"shadow organisation\" within the Department for International Trade. In October 2018 Sir David Wright was designated to head it, but in April 2019 he withdrew. The TRA was expected to be a key part of Britain's drive to expand world trade after leaving the EU. It was intended to propose measures to limit the importation of goods subsidised by foreign governments in detriment of British producers, and oppose tariffs imposed elsewhere on British imports.
