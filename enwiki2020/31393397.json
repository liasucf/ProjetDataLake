The San Francisco Chronicle refers to Marlene Sai as one of the true icons of the islands. The Santa Cruz Sentinel refers to Sai as a living legend of Hawaiian music. PBS Hawaii's Leslie Wilcox says of Sai \"There are only a handful of true divas in Hawaiian music, women who wrap their powerful voices with grace, elegance and beauty. You can add to the list Marlene Sai.\" ==Early years== Sai is from Kaimuki, Hawaii, and a product of the Kamehameha school system. She released her first record in 1959. Sai was taught the basics of singing and mentored by her uncle Andy Cummings, considered another legend of Hawaiian singing and songwriting. Cummings taught his niece the love song \"Kainoa\" written by his friend Jimmy Taka when he found out he was dying of cancer. The song was for his wife. Cummings put the song down on paper and later taught it to his then-teenage niece, Marlene Sai. \"Kainoa\" went on to become Sai's first hit and title for her debut album. Sai was discovered by Hawaiian entertainer Don Ho before he was famous while managing his mother's restaurant lounge Honey's in Kaneohe on the island of Oahu. ==Singing== Marlene Sai, just out of high school, became a teenage recording star. Sai toured Japan in 1962 and has an extensive following there. In 2007 Sai hosted the 23rd annual Ka Himeni Ana singing contest at the Hawaii Theatre. In 2008, Sai performed in concert in New York City at Carnegie Hall. Sai's album Kainoa was considered 21st out of 50 of the all-time great albums of Hawaii by Honolulu magazine in 2004. In the article it states that it wasn't recorded under the most ideal circumstances. When she signed with Sounds of Hawaii, the new label hadn't even finished building its studio. Kainoa was recorded inside the bus depot once located on King Street. \"We recorded late at night, when it was quiet, buses weren't moving and you hoped an airplane didn't fly overhead,\" Sai says. \"But I had Sonny Chillingworth on slack key and Don Ho on the organ behind me, so we still had a ball.\" ===Records and CDs=== *Kainoa 1959 *Sweet Someone *Best Of Marlene Sai 1967 *Hana Hou *Not Pau *Marlene Sai 1985 *I Love You 1994 *Mele No Ka Oe 1996 *Marlene & Mahela 1999 *Legacy 2010 ==Acting== In 1986, Sai played Makua Wahine Luka in the TV series Magnum PI.
