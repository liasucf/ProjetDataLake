Singer, songwriter, model and presenter June Zhu has been in the public eye since she was 15 years old. With this album though, she wanted to take full creative control over her image and sound and she managed to write all the songs by herself. Sparing no expenses for this special undertaking, June spent one month recording the album at Los Angeles's The Village Studio with Black Eyed Peas producer Mario and enlisted the help of Mitch, a sound mixer who works with Dr. Dre, and Wing Shya, a renowned photographer who often works with Wong Kar Wai. == Track listing == == References == Category:2014 albums ",
