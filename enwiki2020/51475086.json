    "text": "\"Law of the Land\" is a soul song written by Norman Whitfield for the Motown label. A socially-conscious funk track with elements of early disco music, it details the rules of human society that people have to accept and live by. ==Details== The song was recorded by both of Whitfield's groups, The Temptations and The Undisputed Truth, in 1973 (January and April, respectively), and both versions were given single release. The Temptations' version was released as a UK-only single by Tamla Motown, and just missed out on the UK Top 40, reaching #41. That version was included on volume eight of the Motown Chartbusters compilation album series. The Undisputed Truth released their version of song that same year, and it became a minor hit in America, making #40 on the R&B; Charts. ==Personnel== ===Temptations version=== * Lead vocals by Dennis Edwards, Richard Street, Damon Harris * Background vocals by Dennis Edwards, Richard Street, Damon Harris, Melvin Franklin and Otis Williams ===Undisputed Truth version=== * Lead and background vocals by Joe Harris, Billie Rae Calvin and Brenda Joyce Evans ==Covers== The Undisputed Truth, having been disbanded for the entirety of the 1980s, reformed with Brainstorm vocalist Belita Woods to record a new version of the song for Motown lover Ian Levine and his Motorcity Records label. The rerecorded song (with some new lyrics added) was released as an 8-minute long 12\" single in 1991. ==References== Category:1971 singles Category:The Temptations songs Category:Songs written by Norman Whitfield Category:Psychedelic soul songs Category:Song recordings produced by Norman Whitfield Category:1971 songs Category:Gordy Records singles Category:Motown singles ",
