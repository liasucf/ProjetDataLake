At the turn of the 20th century there emerged on the Belgrade art scene the first group of modern-day, academically-trained painters in Bosnia and Hercegovina -- Branko Radulovi\u0107, Djordje Mihajlovi\u0107,Gabriel Jurki\u0107, Todor \u0160vraki\u0107, Petar Tije\u0161i\u0107, Karlo Miji\u0107, Djordje Mazali\u0107, Jovan Bijeli\u0107, and Roman Petrovi\u0107 -- among them Branko Radulovi\u0107who it is said showed \"exceptional culture and promise,\" though his life was cut short in the middle of the Great War. Radulovi\u0107 using his delicate color palette on small formats breathed the first whiff of Impressionist painting into Bosnian and Herzegovinian history of art. As a painter of romantic nature, an active participant in the political life and a great connoisseur of music, he announced the beginning of modern art in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Serbia with his rather small but valuable opus of artworks. Although the painter Branko Radulovi\u0107 rounded a cycle which stands at the top of the contemporary Serbian painting for only thirty years of life and ten years of creative work, it hasn't been written much about the artist and today his works are scattered and poorly researched, mostly due to the negligence of profession. He was born on May 26, 1885, in Mostar, where he completed his primary and several years of secondary education which he continued in Belgrade. There he definitely decided to go in for painting and the first step in this regard was made on 9 September in 1903 by entering the Serbian Drawing and Painting School run by Beta Vukanovi\u0107 and Rista Vukanovi\u0107.Branko immediately accepted academic painting style of Vukanovi\u0107 and in the same year created \u201cA Portrait of Andja Golubovi\u0107\u201d, and in the style of Beta Vukanovi\u0107, he worked on silk small lyrical still lives. Diploma of the Vukanovi\u0107\u2019s school from February 1905 was a recommendation to continue his studies at an academy of fine arts in of the European art capitals. As he was late with enrolment in the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague, Branko attended the private Painting School of Karel Reisner (1868-1913) which claimed to be a sort of preparatory course for admission to the Academy of Fine Arts. In the autumn of the following year, he was at the Academy, in the class of Vlaho Bukovac, where he met two other artists, Pero Popovi\u0107 (1881-1941) and Todor \u0160vraki\u0107, with whom in September 1907 he went on to exhibit in Sarajevo in the first exhibition of local academy-trained artists. Branko Radulovi\u0107 painted in a pointillist style, like that of his professor Bukovac,not only during studies in his class but even in 1907 when he moved in the same academy to the special class of professor Franti\u0161ek \u017den\u00ed\u0161ek. A painting called \u201cA Girl with a Book\u201d from 1908 testifies about it. Soon Branko Radulovi\u0107 freed his painting from pointillist \u201ccolored\u201d dots and shorter and longer brushstrokes and took en plein air characteristics, as a girl \u201cIn a Walk\u201d was painted in 1911. Departure, moving to Paris at the beginning of 1912 with the invitation of our painter Lazar Drljaca with whom he shared the apartment and studio, marked the most important turning point in the handwriting of the painter Radulovi\u0107. It is quite certain that Branko Radulovi\u0107 would further transform his expression in Paris in accordance with the current European art if he didn\u2019t set himself one important task \u2013 a patriotic one. The echo of the Sarajevo assassination in 1914 traveled all the way to Paris, from where Radulovi\u0107, for the second time would make his way to the front \u2013 firstly he participated in the Balkan wars and then in World War I, where he was killed in 1916. ==Notable exhibitions== *2017: Branko Radulovi\u0107, National Gallery of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sarajevo ==See also== * List of painters from Serbia * Serbian art == References == Category:1881 births Category:1916 deaths Category:20th- century Serbian painters Category:19th-century Serbian painters ",
