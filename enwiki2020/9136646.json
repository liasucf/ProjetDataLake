    "text": "Psycho: Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture is the soundtrack album to the 1998 remake of Psycho. The record was released on December 1, 1998 by Geffen Records. ==Background== The album includes three adaptations of Bernard Herrmann's score to the original by Danny Elfman (Elfman's adaptation was later released on a separate album. The only released recordings of the original score are new performances by other orchestras, although the 1975 recording was conducted by the composer, Bernard Herrmann.) The rest of the album is made up of songs by rock, metal, country, trip hop, and drum and bass artists. Many of the songs were recorded for the album. Five songs sample the actual film: \"Once Is Not Enough\" repeats a number of Norman Bates and Marion Crane's lines from the 1998 version, and \"Honeymoon Suite\", \"Madhouse\", \"All of My Life\", and \"In the End\" all sample Bernard Herrmann's score to the original film. Two songs are cover versions: \"Psycho\", written by Leon Payne and here performed by Teddy Thompson, was previously recorded by Elvis Costello and Beasts of Bourbon, and \"Psycho Killer\", performed here by James Hall, was originally performed by the Talking Heads. Only two of the songs were already released by their respective artists at the time of the album's release: Rob Zombie's \"Living Dead Girl\" on his album Hellbilly Deluxe, and Girls Against Boys' \"Psycho Future\" on their album Freak*on*ica (both also Geffen releases). \"Screaming\" was later released by Pet Shop Boys as a B-side to their 1999 single \"I Don't Know What You Want But I Can't Give It Anymore\", and \"Fly\" was later included on Lamb's 1999 album Fear of Fours. \"Madhouse\" was the last song recorded by Mono before the band broke up. == Track listing == # \"Prelude\" (Bernard Herrmann) \u2013 Danny Elfman # \"Living Dead Girl\" (Rob Zombie, Scott Humphrey) \u2013 Rob Zombie # \"Once Is Not Enough\" (Howie B.) \u2013 Howie B. # \"Psycho\" (Leon Payne) \u2013 Teddy Thompson # \"Screaming\" (Neil Tennant, Chris Lowe, Tom Stephan) \u2013 Pet Shop Boys # \"Psycho Future\" (GVSB) \u2013 Girls Against Boys # \"Honeymoon Suite\" (Rob Garza, Eric Hilton) \u2013 Thievery Corporation # \"The Murder\" (Herrmann) \u2013 Danny Elfman # \"Madhouse\" (Martin Virgo) \u2013 Mono # \"Psycho Killer\" (David Byrne, Tina Weymouth, Chris Frantz) \u2013 James Hall # \"All of My Life\" (Steve Earle) \u2013 Steve Earle # \"Fly\" (Andy Barlow, Louise Rhodes) \u2013 Lamb # \"In the End\" (Justin Robertson, Roger Lyons) \u2013 Lionrock # \"The Finale\" (Herrmann) \u2013 Danny Elfman ==References== Category:Horror film soundtracks Category:1998 soundtrack albums Category:1990s film soundtrack albums Category:Geffen Records soundtracks Category:Psycho (franchise) ",
