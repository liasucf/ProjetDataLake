He has been a volunteer with Save The Children for over 40 years, serving at various times as Chairman of the Trading Committee, Member of Council and Member of the Executive Committee. In the early 2000s, having sold his majority stake in Oxford Strategic Marketing to the management, he used the proceeds to create a charitable trust with the aim of using the same practical, measurement based approach he'd applied to marketing, to now transforming lives of very poor women and children in West Bengal and Odisha in India, Vietnam, Ghana and Bangladesh.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3668865/Altruists- anonymous.html The trust targeted increased income amongst women as its goal, and set up eight innovative, higher risk pilot tests, subsequently getting larger charities or organisations to scale up the successes. As ever there was strong emphasis on measurement to gauge success against targets. Two projects failed, but six succeeded and four have been scaled up by Save The Children or Oxfam (the Trust's primary partners) or by governments. Key projects have been * educating street children * training exploited child domestic workers as beauticians and finding them jobs. * trebling income and increasing empowerment by creating women's enterprise groups (in Bangladesh and Odisha, India) * training 4,500 teachers in tribal areas in Vietnam One of the trusts projects with Samudram and Oxfam gained a UN Equator Award for poverty reductions and the beautician project was given a Save The Children Phoenix Award for Innovation. The H&S; Davidson Trust estimates that to date it has transformed the lives of 60,000 people through higher income (and greater empowerment). In typical hands on fashion, Hugh Davidson, and his wife, Sandra, personally reviewed all projects, visiting Ghana, India, Vietnam and Bangladesh multiple times. Hugh Davidson was awarded an MBE for services to Charities and to the community of the Isle of Man. ==Articles== # Article: How Marketers Need to Change # Article: How marketing has lost the plot ==References== Category:British businesspeople Category:1935 births Category:Living people ",
