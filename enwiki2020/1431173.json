With 1,021 exhibitors from 50 nations (in 2016) SPIEL is the worldwide biggest fair for board games. Many new games are released at the fair each year, especially (but not exclusively) European-style board games. Messe Essen, the event venue At SPIEL board games are offered which are hard to find in retail because a lot of international and small exhibitors present their products. While the prices for buying the games at the fair do not tend to be significantly lower than those in retail, the games are typically available sooner than in regular board game shops, come with promotional materials (mostly extra cards or tokens with a few more game mechanics, but also T-shirts and similar merchandise) and it is an occasion where passionate board gamers can meet and chat with game designers, illustrators, and famous game reviewers. The fair began in 1983. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !year !attendance !source |- |2011 |147 000 | |- |2012 |149 000 | |- |2013 |156 000 | |- |2014 |158 000 | |- |2015 |162 000 | |- |2016 |174 000 | |- |2017 |182 000 | |- |2018 |190 000 | |- |2019 |209 000 | |} ==See also== *Going Cardboard (documentary) ==References== ==External links== *Official web-site * Category:Annual fairs Category:Fairs in Germany Category:Gaming conventions Category:Trade fairs in Germany Category:1983 establishments in Germany Category:Recurring events established in 1983 ",
