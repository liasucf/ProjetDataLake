The name comes from the Scottish Gaelic _Sl\u00e8ite_ , which in turn comes from Old Norse sl\u00e9ttr (smooth, even), which well describes Sleat when considered in the surrounding context of the mainland, Skye and R\u00f9m mountains that dominate the horizon all about Sleat. Sleat is a traditional parish that has several communities and two major landowners (the Clan Donald Lands Trust and Eilean Iarmain Estate). Sleat Community Trust (), the local development trust, has purchased the Skye Ferry Filling Station at Armadale and in common with many communities is investigating the options for renewable energy production. It also owns Sleat Renewables Ltd., a timber production company.\"Directory of Members\" DTAS. Retrieved 27 October 2007. In October 2007 the Trust hosted the Highlands and Islands Community Energy Company annual conference.\"Community Energy News\" (October 2007) (pdf) HICEC. Retrieved 27 October 2007. In the early 2000s the final section of a new double-track road through Sleat from Armadale Ferry to Broadford was finished. After later substantial upgrades by June 2019 it became a S2 road throughout, the A851. Most teenage school-children in Sleat travel along the A851 to attend Portree High School, where there is a hostel for those who live particularly far away.
