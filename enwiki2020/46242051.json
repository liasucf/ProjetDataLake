He has previously served as a Professor of Computer Science in the Department of Computer Science, Royal Holloway College, London University (2003-2012). He was the Genome annotation Group Leader in Joint Genomic Institute, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (2003) and was the Director of Bioinformatics at EOS Biotechnology (1999-2002). He formerly served as a leader of Computational Genomics Group at the Sanger Centre, Cambridge, UK (1997-1999). He also held positions of Assistant Professor at Baylor College of Medicine, computational scientist at Amgen Inc., visiting scientist at Supercomputer Center, Florida State University, Visiting Professor at ITBA (Milan, Italy) and a group leader at the Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Novosibirsk, Russia. ==Software developing== About 100 software applications implemented as standalone programs or combined in pipeline or packages, have been developed under his guidance. Many of these programs are available for academic community to run on-line or for downloading.Software download page at Softberry Inc. Scientific community actively uses these applications. For example, Fgenesh eukaryotic gene identification program has been used/cited in >3000 scientific publications, according to Google scholar data; Fgenesb bacterial genome annotation pipeline based on Markov chain models was significantly superior to other approaches, in gene finding in bacterial community sequences;Mavromatis et al. Use of simulated data sets to evaluate the fidelity of metagenomic processing methods. Nat Methods, 2007 4(6), 495-500. MolQuest is the most comprehensive, easy-to-use desktop application for sequence analysis and molecular biology data management. ==Other interests== Besides bioinformatics his interests include cryptography and information security. FendoffF - an application to encrypt your passwords, files or images that uses several original encryption methods is developed for iOS and Android as well as for desktop computers. He also developed Wild West Chess computer game. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:Russian bioinformaticians Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:King Abdullah University of Science and Technology faculty ",
