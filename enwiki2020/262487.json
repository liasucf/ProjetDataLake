    "text": "The University Athletic Association (UAA) is an American athletic conference that competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Division III. Member schools are highly selective universities located in Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Ohio, and New York. The eight members are Brandeis University, Carnegie Mellon University, Case Western Reserve University, Emory University, New York University, The University of Chicago, University of Rochester, and Washington University in St. Louis. == Academics == All UAA member schools are private, and ranked in the top 40 of national research universities by U.S. News & World Report's Best Colleges Rankings. Historically, the division was colloquially called the \"egghead eight\", or \"nerdy nine\" when Johns Hopkins was a member. This stems both from the academic strength of the member schools, and the fact that the conference prioritizes academic achievement over athletic prowess. The UAA was the only NCAA conference to have all of its member institutions affiliated with the Association of American Universities, a collection of 65 Ph.D.-granting research institutions, with 63 in the United States and two in Canada, from 2011, when Nebraska joined the previously all-AAU Big Ten, until 2019 when Dartmouth became the last Ivy League institution to join the AAU. ==Member schools== ===Current members=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !Institution !Location !Founded !Undergraduate Enrollment !Total Enrollment !Nickname !School Colors !USNWR Ranking !Endowment (Billion) !Joined !Fall 2020 Acceptance Rate !Alumni Median Starting Salary |- |Brandeis University |Waltham, Massachusetts |1948 |3,608 |5,788 |Judges | |40 |$1.04 |1987 |31% |$50,600 |- |Carnegie Mellon University |Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania |1900 |6,673 |10,875 |Tartans | |25 |$1.72 |1986 |22% |$69,700 |- |Case Western Reserve University |Cleveland, Ohio |1826 |5,383 |11,874 |Spartans | |40 |$1.9 |1986 |27% |$61,300 |- |Emory University |Atlanta, Georgia |1836 |6,861 |12,755 |Eagles | |21 |$6.5 |1986 |15% |$54,600 |- |New York University |Manhattan, New York |1831 |26,135 |42,189 |Violets | |29 |$3.6 |1986 |15% |$54,400 |- |The University of Chicago |Chicago, Illinois |1890 |5,941 |14,788 |Maroons | |6 |$6.1 |1986 |6% |$54,400 |- |University of Rochester |Rochester, New York |1850 |6,386 |9,735 |Yellowjackets | |29 |$2.3 |1986 |29% |$54,800 |- |Washington University in St. Louis |St. Louis, Missouri |1853 |7,540 |13,527 |Bears | |19 |$6.5 |1986 |14% |$57,300 |} All of the universities listed above are founding members except Brandeis, which joined shortly before official competition began in October 1987.
