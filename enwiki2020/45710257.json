He graduated with a magna cum laude Bachelor of Divinity (BD) degree in 1961. In 1961, he returned to the United Kingdom and entered Cuddesdon College, an Anglican theological college, to undertake one year of training for ordination. He later undertook postgraduate study while a priest and academic. He completed a Bachelor of Letters (BLitt) degree at Oriel College, Oxford in 1972 and was awarded a Doctor of Divinity (DD) degree by Berkeley Divinity School in 1987. ==Ordained ministry== Rowthorn was ordained in the Church of England as a deacon on 30 September 1962 and as a priest on 29 September 1963, both times by Mervyn Stockwood, then the Bishop of Southwark.

He taught pastoral theology and liturgics. ===Episcopal ministry=== In May 1987, Rowthorn was elected a suffragan bishop by the Diocese of Connecticut. He was consecrated as a bishop on 19 September 1987 by Edmond L. Browning, the then Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. The co-consecrators were Arthur E. Walmsley and Adrian Delio Caceres-Villavicencio. As one of two suffragan bishops, he had oversight over the eastern half of Connecticut. In 1993, he stood for election as Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Connecticut but was unsuccessful. On 1 January 1994, he was appointed Bishop in Charge of the Convocation of Episcopal Churches in Europe (the jurisdiction of the Episcopal Church that covers Continental Europe). The Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church has jurisdiction over the Convocation but oversight is delegated to another bishop known as the Bishop in Charge.
