    "text": "Radical History Tour is the second album released by Christian parody band ApologetiX. It was originally released in 1994, only on cassette, but was re- released on CD in 1999. ==History== The writing for \"Radical History Tour\" began in 1992 & ended near the end of 1994. Although the cassette was extremely popular, the band decided to not release the new material on CD. However, many fans of ApologetiX had been asking for years for it to be re- released on CD. Finally, due to popular demand, the CD was released in March 1999, 4 months after releasing Jesus Christ Morningstar. Unfortunately, the cassette version was over 90 minutes long, about 14 minutes over the 76 minute barrier of a CD. ApologetiX decided to cut 4 tracks out of the mix. The band claims that they were tempted to go back and re-record them \"1999-style\", but later changed their mind.\"Radical History Tour\" official website The songs were \"Love (Ain't Nothin')\" (\"Long Train Runnin'\"), Verynice City\" (\"Paradise City\"), an early version of \"Enter Samson\" (\"Enter Sandman\"), which was eventually rerecorded & released on Biblical Graffiti, and \"Even Though\", a parody of Pearl Jam's \"Even Flow\".
