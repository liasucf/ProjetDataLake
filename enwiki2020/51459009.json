They had two children, a son, Anil Gamini Jayasuriya, also a gifted artist and conservationist, and a daughter, Anula Kusum Gilmour. ==Career== De Silva studied art in her youth however her artistic career began, after she and her husband approached Geoffrey Bawa in 1960 to design a house for them in Colombo. She developed a long term professional relationship with Bawa designing batik tapestries for a number of his buildings, including the Bentota Beach Hotel and the Sri Lankan Parliament Building. In 1960, she formed a firm with Laki Senanayake, Professor Reggie Siriwardena and her son, Anil Gamini Jayasuriya. In 1964 she established the Matale Heritage Centre, which produced batiks. Following her husband's death she spent two years as a Commonwealth consultant on handicrafts to the British Virgin Islands, upon her return she moved back to her ancestral home in Aluwihare in 1982. De Silva was honoured with a lifetime achievement award by the Geoffrey Bawa Trust in 2011. ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:1922 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Sinhalese artists Category:People from Central Province, Sri Lanka Category:20th-century Sri Lankan painters ",
