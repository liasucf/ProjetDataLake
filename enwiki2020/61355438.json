The play premiered at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C. in April 1982. ==Synopsis== K2 is a one-act two-man play. It centers on mountain climbers Harold and Taylor, who find themselves trapped above sea level on a ledge on the side of K2, the second-highest mountain in the world. ==Production history== K2 first ran at the Arena Stage's Kreeger Theater from April 23 to June 6, 1982. The production was directed by Jacques Levy and starred Stephen McHattie and Stanley Anderson. It received rave reviews from The New York Times and The Washington Post, particularly for Ming Cho Lee's hyper-realistic set design. Lee used over 50,000 board feet of styrofoam to build a set that simulated a massive icy mountainside. The play opened at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre on Broadway on March 30, 1983. This production was directed by Terry Schreiber and starred Jeffrey DeMunn and Jay Patterson. It closed on June 11, 1983, after 10 previews and 85 regular performances. K2 received three nominations at the 37th Tony Awards, winning Best Scenic Design for Lee's set. From December 15, 2000, to January 28, 2001, the play was revived at the Arena Stage. Wendy C. Goldberg directed the revival which starred Rick Holmes and Craig Wallace. K2 has also been staged by other regional theaters, such as by the Virginia Stage Company at the Wells Theatre in 2014. ==Film adaptation== The play was adapted into a film of the same name in 1992. ==References== Category:1982 plays Category:Broadway plays Category:American plays adapted into films Category:Two-handers Category:Works about mountaineering ",
