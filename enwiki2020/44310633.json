    "text": "Romans 2 is the second chapter of the Epistle to the Romans in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It is authored by Paul the Apostle, while he was in Corinth in the mid 50s CE, with the help of an amanuensis (secretary), Tertius, who adds his own greeting in Romans 16:22. Although \"the main theme of the Epistle [is] the doctrine of justification by faith\", in verse 6 Paul \"lays down with unmistakable definiteness and precision the doctrine that works, what a man has done, the moral tenor of his life, will be the standard by which he will be judged at the last day\".Ellicott's Commentary for Modern Readers on Romans 2, accessed 5 September 2016 ==Text== The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 29 verses. ===Textual witnesses=== Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Papyrus 40 (~250; extant verses 1\u20133) *Papyrus 113 (3rd century; extant verses 12\u201313, 29) *Codex Vaticanus (325\u2013350) *Codex Sinaiticus (330\u2013360) *Codex Alexandrinus (400\u2013440) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; extant verses 1\u20134) Romans 2:12\u201313 on Papyrus 113 (3rd century). ===Old Testament references=== * = ; * = ; * = ; ==No partiality with God== === Verse 11 === : For there is no partiality with God.NKJV Cross references: ; ==Circumcision== Paul refers to circumcision as a physical mark of Jewish identity, but for a Jew who breaks the law it becomes a sign of contradiction: \"your circumcision has become uncircumcision\" (). The prophet Jeremiah had spoken of those who were \"circumcised yet uncircumcised\" (, Holman Christian Standard Bible translation). Paul reiterates the teaching of Moses that: > He is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in > the Spirit, not in the letter : \u2014 drawing on Moses' words in : > The Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your > descendants, to love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your > soul, that you may live. ==See also== * Torah * Related Bible parts: Deuteronomy 10, Psalm 62, Proverbs 24, Isaiah 52, Ezekiel 36, Acts 10 ==References== ==Sources== * * * ==External links== * King James Bible - Wikisource *English Translation with Parallel Latin Vulgate *Online Bible at GospelHall.org (ESV, KJV, Darby, American Standard Version, Bible in Basic English) *Multiple bible versions at Bible Gateway (NKJV, NIV, NRSV etc.) 02 ",
