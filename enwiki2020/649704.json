    "text": "David Dixon (born 28 October 1947) is an English actor and screenwriter. He was born at the Nightingale Maternity Home in Derby, near his father's shop in London Road, and brought up there before the family moved to Normanton in 1959. Dixon's most notable role was in the 1981 BBC TV series The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, in which he starred as Ford Prefect. He also received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Ariel in the 1980 BBC version of The Tempest (directed by John Gorrie). He would later rejoin the Hitchhiker's Guide by lending his voice to the \"Ecological Man\" and the \"Zirzla Leader\" in Fit the Twentieth of the radio series, while Geoffrey McGivern, who had originally played the character on radio, returned to the role of Ford. Despite a relatively sparse TV and film career, David Dixon has over the years acquired a loyal fan following online who call themselves \"Dixonites\".The Dixionary ==Filmography== * A Family at War (1970) (TV series) \u2013 Robert Ashton * Escort Girls (1974) \u2013 Hugh Lloyd * The Sweeney (episode \"Big Brother\", 1975) (TV) - Andy Deacon * Jumping Bean Bag (1976, in (BBC TV Play For Today) \u2013 Ozymandias Freemantle * The Legend of Robin Hood (1975) (miniseries) \u2013 Prince John * Rock Follies (1976) (TV series) - PR Man * A Horseman Riding By (1978) (miniseries) \u2013 Keith Horsey * Lillie (1978) (miniseries) \u2013 Prince Leopold * A Family Affair (1979) (miniseries) \u2013 Clifford * The Tempest (1980) (TV) \u2013 Ariel * The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1981) (miniseries) \u2013 Ford Prefect * The Missionary (1982) \u2013 Young Man * Cold Warrior (1984) (miniseries) * Tutti Frutti (1987) (TV) \u2013 Stuart Gordon Inverarrity * Circles of Deceit: Dark Secret (1995) (TV) \u2013 DI Ransome * A Touch of Frost: Fun Times for Swingers (1996) (TV) \u2013 Barry Curzon * Original Sin (1996) (TV) \u2013 Dr Wardle ==References== ==External links== *The Dixionary, David Dixon fanpage *Dixonites Livejournal community * Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:English male film actors Category:English male television actors Category:People from Derby Category:People from Normanton, Derby ",
