The film's planned theatrical release on March 27, 2020 was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Director Robert Jury said, \"The timing has just been so strange with this. While it\u2019s personally disappointing for me that we don\u2019t have a theatrical release, in a very strange way, we might have a bigger audience, or at least an audience that maybe can relate to the movie even more because the topic of unemployment is so relevant and prevalent right now.\" Working Man was released on Apple TV, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play, Vudu and Fandango Now video on demand services on May 5, 2020. ==Reception== On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 7.36/10.

Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times rated the film 3.5 stars out of 4, praising the performances of Gerety, Brown and Shire - noting that \"Gerety delivers a performance that is simply great. He plays a man who is simple but not ignorant. Troubled but not troublesome\". He added that \"Billy Brown gives a screen-commanding performance as Walter, who comes across as an exceedingly kind and decent man but is battling to keep the demons inside him from bubbling to the surface\", and of Talia Shire's performance: \"Her mannerisms and social awkwardness are reminiscent of Shire's Adrian when we first met her in 'Rocky.'\" Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter called the film a \"potent tribute to out-of-work Americans.\" ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2019 films Category:2019 directorial debut films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:2019 drama films Category:American drama films Category:Films about the working class Category:Films not released in theaters due to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Films set in factories Category:Films shot in Chicago ",
