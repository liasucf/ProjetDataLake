    "text": "In projective geometry, the Laguerre\u2013Forsyth invariant is a cubic differential that is an invariant of a projective plane curve. It is named for Edmond Laguerre and Andrew Forsyth, the latter of whom analyzed the invariant in an influential book on ordinary differential equations. Suppose that p:\\mathbf P^1\\to\\mathbf P^2 is a three-times continuously differentiable immersion of the projective line into the projective plane, with homogeneous coordinates given by p(t)=(x_1(t),x_2(t),x_3(t)) then associated to p is the third-order ordinary differential equation :\\left|\\begin{matrix} x&x;'&x;&x;'\\\\\\ x_1&x;_1'&x;_1&x;_1'\\\\\\ x_2&x;_2'&x;_2&x;_2'\\\\\\ x_3&x;_3'&x;_3&x;_3'\\\\\\ \\end{matrix}\\right| = 0. Generically, this equation can be put into the form :x'+Ax+Bx'+Cx = 0 where A,B,C are rational functions of the components of p and its derivatives. After a change of variables of the form t\\to f(t), x\\to g(t)^{-1}x, this equation can be further reduced to an equation without first or second derivative terms :x + Rx = 0. The invariant P=(f')^2R is the Laguerre\u2013Forsyth invariant. A key property of is that the cubic differential is invariant under the automorphism group PGL(2,\\mathbf R) of the projective line. More precisely, it is invariant under t\\to\\frac{at+b}{ct+d}, dt\\to\\frac{ad-bc}{(ct+d)^2}dt, and x\\to C(ct+d)^{-2}x. The invariant vanishes identically if (and only if) the curve is a conic section. Points where vanishes are called the sextactic points of the curve. It is a theorem of Herglotz and Radon that every closed strictly convex curve has at least six sextactic points. This result has been extended to a variety of optimal minima for simple closed (but not necessarily convex) curves by , depending on the curve's homotopy class in the projective plane. ==References== * * Category:Projective geometry ",
