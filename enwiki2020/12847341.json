Going north, it parallels the route of State Road 19 which runs a few miles to the west. It crosses State Road 28 east of Tipton, then passes through the town of Windfall City, and crosses State Road 26 before terminating at U.S. Route 35 in Greentown. == History == SR 213 was first designated in 1932 along the modern route of SR 13 from south of North Manchester north to SR 114. Between 1939 and 1941 SR 13 became SR 37 in Hamilton County and the modern route of SR 37 opened to traffic. At this time SR 213 was commissioned along its modern route from SR 37 to SR 18. The segment north of US 35/SR 22 was removed between 1942 and 1945. The segment near North Manchester became part of SR 13 between 1947 and 1948, removing SR 213 in that area. The highway was paved between SR 37 and Omega between 1956 and 1957. The segment of road between SR 28 and Greentown was paved between 1966 and 1967. The final segment of road was paved by 1968. ==Major intersections== ==References== ==External links== 213 Category:Transportation in Hamilton County, Indiana Category:Transportation in Howard County, Indiana Category:Transportation in Tipton County, Indiana ",
