    "text": "In mathematics, the Bateman function (or k-function) is a special case of the confluent hypergeometric function studied by Harry Bateman(1931). Bateman defined it by :\\displaystyle k_n(x) = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\cos(x\\tan\\theta-n\\theta) \\, d\\theta Bateman discovered this function, when Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n asked for the solution of the following differential equation which appeared in the theory of turbulenceMartin, P.

Bateman denoted this function as \"k\" function in honor of Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n. This is not to be confused with another function of the same name which is used in Pharmacokinetics. ==Properties== *k_0(x) = e^{-|x|} *k_{-n}(x) = k_n(-x) *k_n(0)=\\frac{2}{n\\pi} \\sin \\frac{n\\pi}{2} *k_2(x)=(x+|x|) e^{-|x|} *|k_n(x)|\\leq 1 for real values of n and x *k_{2n}(x)=0 for x<0 if n is a positive integer * If n is an odd integer, then k_n(x) = -\\frac{2x}{\\pi} [K_1(-x) + K_0(-x)], \\ x<0, where K_n(-x) is the Modified Bessel function of the second kind. ==References== Category:Special hypergeometric functions Category:Special functions ",
