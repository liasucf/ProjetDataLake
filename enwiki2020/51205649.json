In light of the rise of Nazism in neighboring Germany, Kramarsky emigrated to Canada, and later New York City. While in Amsterdam, Kramarsky compiled a large art collection that included several paintings of Vincent van Gogh. Shortly before the German invasion of the Netherlands, he bought Daubigny's Garden and the Portrait of Dr. Gachet from Franz Koenigs. In 1990, the latter was sold by Kramarsky's heirs to Ryoei Saito for $82.5 million, making it one of the most expensive paintings in the world. == Art collections from Kramarsky == File:Portrait of Dr. Gachet.jpg|Vincent van Gogh: Portr\u00e4t des Dr. Gachet 1890, private collection File:Van Gogh - Der Garten von Daubigny2.jpg|Vincent van Gogh: Der Garten Daubignys 1890, Hiroshima Museum of Art File:Van Gogh - Die Br\u00fccke von Trinquetaille.jpeg|Vincent van Gogh: Die Br\u00fccke von Trinquetaille 1888, Privatsammlung, Leihgabe im Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich File:Vincent Van Gogh - Shoes 2.jpg|Vincent van Gogh: Schuhe 1888, Metropolitan Museum of Art == References == Category:1893 births Category:1961 deaths Category:Businesspeople from L\u00fcbeck Category:German art collectors Category:20th-century art collectors Category:German bankers Category:Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to the United States ",
