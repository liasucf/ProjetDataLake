However, despite this slow start, IPL 5 garnered a higher cumulative viewership than any previous edition of the IPL. The cumulative reach for 74 IPL 5 matches was recorded at 163 million against 162 million for 73 matches in IPL 4, and the final match had a higher reach than any previous final. ===2012 Cricinfo IPL XI=== * Chris Gayle * Gautam Gambhir (C) * Suresh Raina * Jacques Kallis * Rohit Sharma * MS Dhoni (WK) * Ambati Rayudu * Dale Steyn * Parvinder Awana * Umesh Yadav * Sunil Narine * Steve Smith (12th man) ===Spot fixing=== On 14 May 2012, an Indian news channel India TV aired a sting operation that accused five players involved in spot fixing.
