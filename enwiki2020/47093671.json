    "text": "Heidi Lynne Gluck is a musician, singer, and songwriter based in Kansas City. She is a multi-instrumentalist solo artist, band member, producer, and studio musician. == Releases == === The Only Girl In The Room (2015) === On her debut EP, \"The Only Girl in the Room,\" Heidi Lynne Gluck rummages through a collection of battered and beautiful sounds that explore the ideas of family and where home truly is. She also tackles the more contentious issues of how a woman comes into a sense of self and other obstacles that come from the world around her. Her lyrics are occasionally barbed but still manage not to keep you at an arm\u2019s length. She surrounds herself with gossamer guitar lines backed against a folksy rhythmic gait; there are also interludes of juke joint piano and a host of expressive arrangements that give her voice the platform from which to rise, sustain and become a defiant force on behalf of her listeners. === Pony Show (2016) === \"Pony Show,\" was produced, composed, and recorded by Gluck. Her sophisticated arrangements provide a strong foundation for melancholy lyrics sung with a delicate, self-assured and authentic voice. Born in Manitoba, Canada, Gluck\u2019s songwriting carries forth the tradition of her heroes and fellow Canadian exports, her Holy Trinity: Leonard, Joni, and Neil. Heidi\u2019s production and arrangements are informed by their Laurel Canyon migration as well as the more orchestrated pop recordings of the 60s and 70s. == Discography == {| class=\"wikitable\" |Year |Album Title |Artist |Instruments Played |- |2016 |Pony Show, Heidi Lynne Gluck |Heidi Lynne Gluck |Songwriter, bass, guitars, vocals, keys, lap steel, piano, accordion, drums, engineer |- |2016 |Untitled (In production), Gentleman Caller |Gentleman Caller |Vocals |- |2016 |Untitled (In production), Matt Pryor |Matt Pryor |Piano, vocals, slide guitar, accordion |- |2016 |Untitled (In production), Simrit |Simrit |Bass, guitar, piano |- |2015 |The Only Girl In The Room, Heidi Lynne Gluck |Heidi Lynne Gluck |Songwriter, bass, guitars, vocals, keys, lap steel, piano, accordion, drums, engineer |- |2015 |Superhero, David England |David England |Bass, vocals, keys, piano, guitar |- |2015 |Downtown In The Dark, Gentleman Caller |Gentleman Caller |Bass, vocals, keys, piano, slide guitar |- |2015 |From The Ancient Storm, Simrit |Simrit |Bass, vocals, keys, piano |- |2014 |Fumes, Lily & Madeleine |Lily & Madeleine |Bass, keys, piano, guitar, songwriter |- |2014 |Slingshot To Heaven, Margot & the Nuclear So and So's |Margot & the Nuclear So and Sos |Bass, vocals, keys, piano, melodica |- |2014 |Simrit (s/t) |Simrit |Bass, vocals, keys, piano, guitar |- |2014 |Permeable Life, Carrie Newcomer |Carrie Newcomer |Bass, vocals, keys, lap steel, piano, accordion |- |2013 |Strange Stains, Berwanger |Berwanger |Bass, vocals, lap steel |- |2013 |Lily & Madeleine (s/t) |Lily & Madeleine |Bass, vocals, lap steel, piano, keys |- |2012 |Rot Gut, Domestic, Margot & the Nuclear So and So's |Margot & the Nuclear So and Sos |Vocals |- |2012 |Locked Doors & Pretty Fences, Joel Henderson |Joel Henderson |Bass, vocals, piano |- |2008 |Cinnamon Girl (Neil Young Tribute), Various Artists |Various Artists |Bass, vocals, guitar, keys, piano |- |2007 |Keeper Of Youth, Berwanger |The Only Children |Bass, vocals, keys, piano |- |2007 |Limbeck, (s/t) |Limbeck |Vocals |- |2006 |Musical Family Tree: Delicious Berries, Various Artists |Various Artists |Bass, guitar, vocals, keys, songwriter |- |2006 |Crushing Love, Some Girls |Some Girls |Bass, guitar, vocals, keys, piano, songwriter |- |2004 |Change Of Living, Berwanger |The Only Children |Vocals, accordion |- |2004 |In The Garden, Courtney Kaiser |Courtney Kaiser |Bass, vocals |- |2003 |Feel It, Some Girls |Some Girls |Bass, vocals, keys, piano, harmonica |- |2003 |The Pieces, (s/t) |The Pieces |Bass, vocals, keys, piano, songwriter |- |2002 |Baby's Breadth, June Panic |June Panic |Keys, lap steel, piano, vocals |- |2002 |Music For Picnics, Sophia Travis |Sophia Travis |Bass, vocals, lap steel |- |2002 |EP Series: PI, I2, E3, C4, E5, S6, The Pieces |The Pieces |Vocals, bass, keys, guitar, lap steel. |} == See also == Some Girls (band) Margot & the Nuclear So and So's ==References== * I Heart Local Music Review: Heidi Lynne Gluck \u2013 \"The Only Girl In The Room\" EP. http://iheartlocalmusic.com/2015/05/15/review-heidi-lynne-gluck-the-only-girl- in-the-room-ep/ * Unrecorded Heidi GluckThe Only Girl In The Room EP. https://web.archive.org/web/20150630001044/http://www.unrecorded.mu/reviews/heidi- gluck-the-only-girl-in-the-room-ep/ * The Ptich Heidi Lynne Gluck's debut belongs in your rotation . http://www.pitch.com/kansascity/heidi-lynne-glucks- debut-belongs-in-your-rotation/Content?oid=5206236 * The Deli Magazine Album Review: Heidi Lynne Gluck - The Only Girl in the Room. http://kansascity.thedelimagazine.com/heidigluck1 * I Heart Local Music It\u2019s time to root for Heidi Gluck. http://iheartlocalmusic.com/2015/06/08/its-time- to-root-for-heidi-gluck/ Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Winnipeg Category:Canadian accordionists Category:Women accordionists Category:Canadian women guitarists Category:21st-century Canadian multi- instrumentalists Category:Canadian rock bass guitarists Category:Canadian rock keyboardists Category:Canadian rock pianists Category:Canadian women pianists Category:Women bass guitarists Category:Canadian female drummers Category:21st-century Canadian bass guitarists Category:21st-century Canadian pianists Category:21st-century Canadian singers Category:21st-century Canadian drummers Category:21st-century Canadian guitarists Category:21st-century Canadian keyboardists Category:Canadian female singer-songwriters Category:21st-century accordionists Category:21st-century Canadian women singers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
