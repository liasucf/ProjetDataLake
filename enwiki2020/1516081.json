    "text": "\"Steve\" Fonyo Jr. (born June 29, 1965 in Montreal) is a Canadian runner with an artificial leg who was a nationally renowned fundraiser for cancer research and treatment and a former Officer of the Order of Canada. Fonyo lost his left leg to cancer at age 12. He later embarked on a cross-Canada marathon entitled the \"Journey for Lives\" to raise funds for cancer research. In doing so, he followed in the footsteps of Terry Fox. Unlike Fox, who had to abandon the Marathon of Hope when his cancer returned, Fonyo completed the coast-to-coast marathon and also completed a marathon across the United Kingdom. Fonyo began his \"Journey for Lives\" marathon on March 31, 1984, at age 18, and completed it 425 days later on May 29, 1985, covering and raising $14 million (CDN). He was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1985, the youngest person ever given that status at the time. This achievement was marred by grief, as his father Steve Fonyo Sr. died of lung cancer the same year. He studied mechanics and aircraft maintenance at an early age. He repeatedly ran afoul of the law, and was charged and convicted of various crimes. In February 2015, friends and family reported to news media that Fonyo was in an induced coma in Royal Columbian Hospital after being stabbed by three home invaders at his residence in Whalley, a neighbourhood of Surrey. The doctors placed Fonyo in a medically induced coma for a month after the attack. ==Legal troubles== In 1996, Fonyo pleaded guilty to 16 charges for offences in Edmonton, including assault with a weapon, aggravated assault, fraud for writing bad cheques totalling $10,000 to supermarkets, and possession of a stolen vehicle. He has also been convicted at least five times of impaired driving and seven times of driving without a licence, most recently in the fall of 2008. On August 13, 2009, Fonyo, last known to have been working as a heavy-machinery mechanic, appeared in Surrey Provincial Court charged with one count of assault. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to one day in jail. He was credited for 10 days already served. He was also subject to a one-year probation order. But just five days later, the 44-year-old was back in Surrey court, having breached his conditions. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 14 days in jail. His membership in the Order of Canada was revoked on December 10, 2009. On January 27, 2010, Fonyo gave a brief telephone interview to CTV News from the Surrey Remand Centre, where he was serving the balance of his sentence on an assault charge after breach of his parole. Fonyo stated it was wrong to have his Order of Canada revoked, as it was given to him for something he had previously done. On August 6, 2010, he was again arrested for fraud. On August 28, 2010, Fonyo married Lisa Greenwood. On December 7, 2010, Fonyo pleaded guilty to threatening Greenwood and to unrelated charges of fraud, credit card fraud, and driving with a suspended licence. ==Legacy== Steve Fonyo Drive in Kingston, Ontario, is named after him, as is Steve Fonyo Beach in Victoria, British Columbia, where he ended his run. Fonyo Road was also named in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. In 2015, Fonyo was the subject of Alan Zweig's documentary film Hurt\"Doc explores the life of Steve Fonyo, the man who completed the run Terry Fox started\". The Globe and Mail, September 13, 2015. which covered Fonyo's decline into addiction and homelessness. It won the Platform Prize at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival and the best feature documentary Canadian Screen Award. ==References== ==External links== * Whatever Happened To: Steve Fonyo * FactsCanada.ca, 2001 newsletter * Steve Fonyo Bio - Canadian Encyclopedia Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian disabled sportspeople Category:Canadian amputees Category:Canadian people of Hungarian descent Fonyo, Steve Category:Cancer survivors Category:People from Surrey, British Columbia ",
