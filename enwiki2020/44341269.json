In this role he began to consult with others and a four-man team (Matsutani, Toshikazu Kase, Matsudaira, and Rear Admiral Sokichi Takagi) put together a secret report recommending practical strategies for handling the defeat of Japan. When Matsutani retired he was commanding officer of the Northern Self-Defence Force. ==Views== In a textbook issued to officers at the National Defence College in May 1973, Matsutani expressed the view that in the Vietnam War the Americans had underestimated the power of nationalism, as they were fighting from a purely ideological perspective, and said that the Japanese should learn this lesson. ==Bibliography== * ==References== Category:1903 births Category:1998 deaths Category:Japanese generals ",
