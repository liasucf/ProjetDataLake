E. Morris Former Archbishop of Wales The Times Wednesday, 20 Oct 1971; pg. 16; Issue 58303; col F His papers are held at the Roderic Bowen Library.Theological and Religious Studies Collection Directory A staunch defender of the Church in Wales, Morris attracted controversy when he said that \"The Church in Wales is the Catholic Church in this land\" and referred to Roman Catholic and Nonconformist clergy as being \"strictly speaking, intruders\" whose rights to function in Wales could not be acknowledged. He also campaigned against the retention of the word \"Protestant\" in the Coronation Oath, entering into detailed correspondence with the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher, on the issue. He was unsuccessful, and Fisher even questioned whether such matters were really the business of a prelate who was \"not a bishop of the Church of England\". Nonetheless, Fisher (who had by then retired) and Morris were later among those senior clergy who objected to the proposed Anglican-Methodist reunion which was being mooted during the late 1960s and early 1970s. They remained on friendly terms, with Fisher even saying that the new flurries of correspondence between them was \"quite like old times\". For all his claims of a Tractarian position however, Morris did not, it appears, always endear himself to those clergy who took a more Anglo-Catholic stance. He prohibited extra-eucharistic devotions to the Sacrament (such as Benediction) in his diocese and insisted that permission be sought before the Sacrament was reserved in a tabernacle or aumbry for use in giving Holy Communion to the sick. Although the basis for his faith and doctrine was undoubtedly the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, he oversaw as Archbishop of Wales the preparation of a new Order for the Celebration of the Holy Eucharist for use in the Church in Wales. When, in 1966 this replaced the 1662 rite he commended it unreservedly, saying that the new rite brought \"priest and people more effectively than does the Prayer Book service\". The John Piper east window and mural at St Woolos' (Gwynllyw) Cathedral in Newport, Wales, were commissioned and installed during his episcopate.Peart- Binns J.S, 1990: Edwin Morris, Archbishop of Wales, Llandyssul, Gomer Press. ==References== Category:1894 births Category:1971 deaths Category:People from Ceredigion Category:Alumni of St John's College, Oxford Category:British Army personnel of World War I Category:Academics of the University of Wales, Lampeter Category:Bishops of Monmouth Category:Archbishops of Wales Category:20th-century Anglican bishops Category:20th-century Anglican archbishops Category:Sub-Prelates of the Venerable Order of Saint John ",
