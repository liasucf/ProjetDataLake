In the modern Batman comic book continuity, the Batphone made its debut in Detective Comics #786 (November, 2003), in the form of an encrypted cellphone that allowed Gordon to securely contact Batman. It also carries a tracking device in case of trouble. Unlike the original Batphone, the device is not red and looks like a regular cellphone. This version also became the version of the Bat-Signal used in Batman: Earth One. ==Use in pop culture== In the HBO's TV series Entourage, super agent Ari Gold constantly uses his bat phone to conduct business. A song titled \u201cBatphone\u201d appears on the sixth album by British rock band Arctic Monkeys, Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino. ==Use in the real world== A bat phone often has some or all of the following properties: *It gets answered outside of working hours *It does not make the caller wait on hold or navigate through voice menus *The line rings straight through to high-level management or technicians without having to be transferred from front lines. *The number is given only to selected people *Shields technical personnel from receiving irrelevant calls Bat phones are common in many industries. The phone numbers are typically given to key customers so that they may reach important individuals in case of emergencies or critical situations. Bat phones can also provide direct access to politicians or notable people. In the United Kingdom, police stations with front counters may have a call point for when the front counter is closed, nicknamed a \"bat phone\".
