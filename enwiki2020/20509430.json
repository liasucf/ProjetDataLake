Hundreds of people passed through the reception room to gawk at \"what was to all of them a very funny sight\", but he got the job.Van Gelder, Lawrence. \"ON THE JOB;When Your Resume Was a Blank Page\", The New York Times, March 3, 1996.

After the auction was held, Friedlaender would repurchase some of the items on the open market. The managing director of the London bookshop Bernard Quaritch said that Friedlaender would look at these items as lost children and say \"I\u2019m going to take them back and give them a proper home\" before repurchasing them.
