In 2012, the school acquired the Marylebone Town Hall and spent \u00a360 million to refurbish it with the objective of expanding its teaching facilities by 70%. LBS has also acquired the site of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who vacated the building in November 2019. LBS has a secondary campus in Dubai that is dedicated to Executive Education and the Dubai EMBA. ==History== === Foundation === Sussex Place, main campus of the London Business School in London London Business School was founded in 1964 under the name of the 'London Graduate School of Business Studies', with Dr. Arthur Earle as Dean. In 1965, the school was registered as a company and was designated by the University of London as an institution having recognised teachers. In 1966, the first Executive Development Programme was launched, followed by the Senior Executive Programme. The same year, a full-time MSc degree was also launched, with Sheila Cross enrolling as the School's first female student. In 1968, the School inaugurated the Sloan Fellowship MSc programme, which was the first one outside of the US. 17 students were enrolled and the programme was funded by the Alfred P. Sloan foundation. The first doctoral programme was established in 1969 and in 1970 Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II opened the School's Regent's Park campus. The first PhD was awarded in 1974, and that year women made up over 15% of the student body for the first time. In 1983, the first part-time MBA programme was held under the direction of Sir Andrew Likierman, a former Dean of the School. In 1986, the school officially became the London Business School and was incorporated by Royal Charter, which gave LBS the right to confer and grant degrees. In 1992, the School was given the Queen's Award for Export in recognition of providing educational services to managers and companies worldwide. The following year, the school started its first Masters in Finance programme and in 2001, the EMBA-Global degree programme in partnership with the Columbia Business School. In 2007 a new campus was opened in Dubai to offer both Executive MBA and Executive Education Programmes. In 2009, the school started two new programmes: The EMBA-Global Asia, in partnership with the University of Hong Kong and Columbia Business School, and the Masters in Management (MiM). In 2012, the school acquired Marylebone Town Hall and restored it with the objective of expanding its teaching facilities by 70 per cent. The building was renamed \"The Sammy Ofer Centre\" in honour of a generous donor, the Ofer Family, who made a gift for the development of the building, which was opened in 2017. In 2016, LBS launched a new programme, the Masters in Financial Analysis, aimed at recent graduates who wish to pursue a career in finance, and acquired the lease of the neighbouring building of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaenocologists, which it will occupy in 2020. With the objective of increasing its size, the school organised a \u00a3100 million funding campaign. By the beginning of 2016, it had raised \u00a398 million, \u00a340 million of which will be used to renovate the Marylebone Town Hall, with \u00a328 million for research, \u00a318 million in scholarships for students, \u00a310 million to increase the school's endowment, and \u00a34 million to improve technology across the school. By June 2016, the school had raised \u00a3125 million, including two \u00a325 million gifts from alumni Jim Ratcliffe and Idan Ofer. Fran\u00e7ois Ortalo-Magn\u00e9, the French-born former Dean of the Wisconsin School of Business, succeeded Sir Andrew Likierman as Dean in August 2017. ==Campus== The campus is located at Sussex Place in Marylebone, on the perimeter of Regent's Park. LBS maintains a number of facilities, including a sports centre, restaurant, three cafes and a library, all dedicated for the exclusive use of its community. There is also a privately run pub, 'The Windsor Castle' attached to the campus. Most classrooms for the MBA are located in the Sainsbury Wing, the centre of the terrace, most of which are 100-student amphitheatre rooms. There is no accommodation on campus for students in full-time programmes, although there are rooms on-campus for visiting faculty and executive education participants. Most students choose to live in nearby private residential buildings or in students halls of residence such as the International Students House, London. LBS is expanding its campus in central London. The business school has redeveloped the Marylebone Town Hall into classrooms and offices at the Sammy Ofer Centre. It will further expand it in 2020 (see above).
