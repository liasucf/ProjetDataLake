It was established in 1750, and was originally called Regina d'Ungheria (the Queen of Hungary) under the Austro-Hungarian empire. The caf\u00e9 has its origins in the popular Venice of the 17th century, it became later Orso Coronato (Crowned Bear) because of the picturesque sign showing a bear standing on his hind legs with a crown on its head. In 1860, Carlo Lavena bought the caf\u00e8 and it has remained in his family ever since. ==External links== * Official Site of Caff\u00e9 Lavena Category:Buildings and structures in Venice Category:Coffee houses of Italy ",
