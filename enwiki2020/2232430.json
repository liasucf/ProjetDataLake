    "text": "Novena MRT station is an underground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station along the North South Line at Thomson Road in Novena, Singapore. It is the nearest MRT station to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, Novena Square, Square 2 and United Square. ==History== Prior to the opening of the station, it was named Thomson Road. Later on in 1985 it was renamed to Novena. The station was named after the popular weekly Novena devotion sessions held at the nearby Catholic Church of Saint Alphonsus, more popularly known as the Novena Church. The term \"Novena\" is derived from the Latin word \"Novem\" which means nine, and which refers to prayers said for nine consecutive days. The station had undergone elevator refurbishment from January 2000 due to the disabled access from Tan Tock Seng Hospital. It was finally completed in March 2002, with the elevators beginning operating at this station. Originally, the station's distinctive features are bright green wall tiles, but the tiles were all falling in 2005. The station was completely refurbished in May 2007, at the same time when Square 2 also opened. The elevators at Novena MRT station were replaced from September 2006 to May 2007. Cash top ups are not accepted at the passenger service centres from 23 June 2018 at this station. ==Cultural impact== The station is rumoured to be haunted, possibly because the area used to be the site of a Jewish cemetery. ==Around the station== * Abdul Hamid Mosque ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1987 establishments in Singapore Category:Novena, Singapore Category:Railway stations opened in 1987 Category:Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) stations ",
