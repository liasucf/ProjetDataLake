Shortly thereafter, Emperor Go-Fukakusa is said to have acceded to the throne (sokui).Titsingh, pp. 247\u2013248; Varley, p. 44; n.b., a distinct act of senso is unrecognized prior to Emperor Tenji; and all sovereigns except Jit\u014d, Y\u014dzei, Go-Toba, and Fushimi have senso and sokui in the same year until the reign of Emperor Go-Murakami. In 1259, at the insistence of Retired Emperor Go-Saga, he abdicated at the age of 15 to his younger brother, who would become Emperor Kameyama. After Emperor Go-Uda's ascension in 1260, Saionji Sanekane negotiated with the Bakufu, and succeeded in getting Emperor Go-Fukakusa's son Hirohito named as Crown Prince. In 1287, with his ascension as Emperor Fushimi, Go-Fukakusa's cloistered rule began. In 1290, he entered the priesthood, retiring from the position of cloistered Emperor. But, with his seventh son, Imperial Prince Hisaaki becoming the 8th Kamakura sh\u014dgun among other things, the position of his Jimy\u014din-t\u014d became strengthened. In 1304, he died. He is enshrined with other emperors at the imperial tomb called Fukakusa no kita no misasagi (\u6df1\u8349\u5317\u9675) in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto. ===Kugy\u014d=== is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted. In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career. During Go-Fukakusa's reign, this apex of the Daij\u014d-kan included: * Sessh\u014d, Ichij\u014d Sanetsune, 1246\u20131247 * Sessh\u014d, Konoe Kanetsune, 1247\u20131252 * Sessh\u014d, Takatsukasa Kanehira, 1252\u20131254 * Kampaku, Takatsukasa Kanehira, 1254\u20131261 * Sadaijin * Udaijin * Nadaijin * Dainagon ==Eras of Go-Fukakusa's reign== The years of Go-Fukakusa's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or neng\u014d.Titsingh, p. 248. * Kangen (1243\u20131247) * H\u014dji (1247\u20131249) * Kench\u014d (1249\u20131257) * K\u014dgen (1256\u20131257) * Sh\u014dka (1257\u20131259) * Sh\u014dgen (1259\u20131260) ==See also== * Emperor of Japan * List of Emperors of Japan * Imperial cult * Prince Hisahito of Akishino ==Notes== Japanese Imperial kamon \u2014 a stylized chrysanthemum blossom ==References== * Ponsonby-Fane, Richard Arthur Brabazon.
