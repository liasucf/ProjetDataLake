    "text": "In aviation, precision runway monitor (PRM) is a high-speed, high-precision radar system developed by Raytheon to monitor simultaneous close parallel instrument approaches to airports. PRM is one type of radar system that can be used to allow simultaneous approaches on parallel runways that are spaced less than to each other. Airports at which PRM is in use in the United States include Chicago-O'Hare, San Francisco, Detroit, and Atlanta. Internationally only Sydney, Australia uses PRM. Additionally, flight crew wishing to fly PRM approaches are required to undergo specific training related to these approaches before taking part. The training includes practicing the climbing and descending \u201cBREAKOUT\u201d manoeuvre in the simulator. == See also == * Instrument approach Category:Airport infrastructure ",
