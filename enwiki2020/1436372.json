    "text": "In the field of fluid dynamics the point at which the boundary layer changes from laminar to turbulent is called the transition point. Where the boundary layer becomes turbulent, drag due to skin friction is relatively high. As speed increases, the upper surface transition point tends to move forward. As the angle of attack increases, the upper surface transition point also tends to move forward. Category:Boundary layers Behind the transition point in a boundary layer the mean speed and friction drag increases. ",
