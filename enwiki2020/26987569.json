The musical is a loose autobiography of Scott herself, showing her travels from her half-Mennonite Kansas childhood to a life in show business. ==Concept== The show is called a \"stage memoir disguised as fiction\", and a \"mixed jukebox musical\". Songs by singers and songwriters include David Byrne, Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings, and the Johnny Mercer-Harry Warren \"On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe.\" The Judy Garland standards \"Get Happy\" and \"You Made Me Love You\" are sung, the \"latter amusingly illustrated with a series of cheeky images of Jesus.\"Sommer, Elyse. \"Curtain Up review: Everyday Rapture\".
