    "text": "Garry Moore (born Thomas Garrison Morfit; January 31, 1915 \u2013 November 28, 1993) was an American entertainer, comedic personality, game show host, and humorist best known for his work in television. He began a long career with the CBS network starting in radio from 1937 and then a television host on several variety and game shows from 1949 through to the mid 1970s. After dropping out of high school, Moore found success as a radio host and then moved on to the medium of television. He hosted several daytime and prime time programs titled The Garry Moore Show, and the game shows I've Got a Secret and To Tell the Truth. He was instrumental in furthering the career of comedic actress Carol Burnett. He became known for his bow ties and his crew cut fashion early in his career. After being diagnosed with throat cancer in 1976, Moore retired from the broadcasting industry, only making a few rare television appearances. He spent the last years of his life in Hilton Head, South Carolina and at his summer home in Northeast Harbor in Maine. He died on November 28, 1993, at the age of 78. ==Early life and radio career== Moore was born on January 31, 1915, in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Mason P. Morfit and Mary L. (n\u00e9e Harris) Morfit. He attended Baltimore City College (actually a high school), but dropped out to pursue a career in radio and writing. Starting in 1937, he worked for Baltimore radio station WBAL as an announcer, writer and actor/comedian. He used his birth name until 1940, when, while on the air announcing Club Matinee hosted by Ransom Sherman at NBC, Chicago, Sherman held a radio contest to find a more easily pronounceable one. \"Garry Moore\" was the winning entry, which was submitted by a woman from Pittsburgh who received a prize of $100. It was on Club Matinee where he met his long- time friend and broadcasting partner Durward Kirby. Moore headed Talent, Ltd., a variety program on Sunday afternoons in 1941. In the years that followed, Moore appeared on numerous network radio shows. He started out as an announcer and then as support for broadcast personalities, one of whom was Jimmy Durante. From 1943-47, Durante and Moore had a joint show with Moore as the straight man.The Jimmy Durante And Garry Moore Show, NBC (1943), CBS (1943-1947): Impressed with his ability to interact with audiences, CBS offered him his own show. Starting in 1949, the one-hour daytime variety show The Garry Moore Show aired on CBS. Moore briefly returned to radio as host of NBC's Monitor in 1969. ==Television career== Between 1947 and 1950, Moore began to make tentative steps into the new medium as a panelist and guest host on quiz and musical shows. On June 26, 1950, he was rewarded with his own 30-minute CBS early-evening talk-variety TV program, The Garry Moore Show, which was a shorter version of his radio show. Until September 1950, it was also simulcast on radio. During 1950 and 1951, he hosted prime-time variety hour summer replacements for Arthur Godfrey and his Friends. He appeared as a guest star on other programs including CBS's Faye Emerson's Wonderful Town. During his run as a variety-show host, Moore was tapped to host CBS' weekly prime-time TV panel show I've Got a Secret. It premiered on June 19, 1952. On this show, Moore began his friendships with comedian Henry Morgan and game show host and panelist Bill Cullen, with whom he had a long working relationship. Morgan later stated that Moore had helped him keep his job as a television host. > One night I was doing my own local TV show and, in lighting a cigarette, I > remarked that I was creating my own cancer. It didn't occur to me, of > course, that 'Secret' was sponsored by Winston, the w.k. cancer purveyors. > But it did occur to a viewer, a well-wisher who got in touch with Winston- > Salem so fast that they fired me at dawn. Garry flew down to North Carolina > and talked them out of it. What can you do with a guy like that? More to the > point, what can you do without him? Moore became known for his involvement > in the variety of stunts and demonstrations of the show's contestants.

The show > provided a break into show business for many performers, including Alan > King, Jonathan Winters, Carol Burnett and Dorothy Loudon. The Garry Moore > Show featured regular supporting cast members Durward Kirby, Marion Lorne, > Denise Lor and Ken Carson, as well as a mixture of song-and-dance routines > and comedy skits, and introduced the public to comedienne Carol Burnett. > After the show ended, Burnett became a star in her own right, hosting The > Carol Burnett Show for many years.

Every time a joke would bomb > with the audience, Moore would turn to the camera and say, \"it's your fault > for still watching this!\" The home audience was so fascinated by the frank > honesty of Moore that they stuck with the episode, and it was one of the > highest rated episodes of the season. The Garry Moore Show was cancelled in > 1964, and in the summer of that year, after having been on radio and > television for 27 uninterrupted years, Moore decided to retire, saying he > had \"said everything [he] ever wanted to say three times already.\" He gave > up hosting I've Got a Secret and was replaced by comedian Steve Allen, who > would host the show until the end of its run in 1967 (although Moore had > ended his retirement before I've Got a Secret left the air, he never > returned to the series as host and Allen helmed a subsequent, one-season > syndicated revival in 1972).

That show was a revival of To Tell the Truth, which had > ended its run on CBS in 1968. Moore was asked to host a revival of the > series for syndication, which launched in September 1969.
