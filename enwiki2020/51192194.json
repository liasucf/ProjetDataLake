The cathedral church is located in Dante Alighieri Square in the city center. It dedicated to St. Theresa of \u00c1vila, reflecting the appreciation of the local Italian immigrants to the Empress Teresa Cristina, wife of Pedro II, emperor of Brazil. The first stone of the church was laid on 5 December 1895. The work proceeded rapidly, with the spontaneous support of the settlers. It was enclosed by mid-1896, solemnly inaugurated on 14 October 1899, and consecrated by bishop Cl\u00e1udio Gon\u00e7alves Ponce de Leon on 15 October 1900, the Feast of St. Theresa. It was designated a cathedral in 1934, with the erection of the Diocese of Caxias. ==See also== *Catholic Church in Brazil ==References== Internal view Theresa Category:Buildings and structures in Caxias do Sul Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1899 Category:Roman Catholic Ecclesiastical Province of Porto Alegre Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Brazil ",
