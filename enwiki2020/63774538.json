She attended the Esayan Elementary and High School. She took Armenian language lessons for five years from linguist Hagop Kurken, whose attention she had attracted during her final grade in the high school. She then served as assistant teacher at the orphanage of the Yedikule Armenian Hospital for four years. ==Career== Her first article was published in Manz\u00fbme-i Efk\u00e2r, an Armeno-Turkish periodical. Because of this article, she received job offers from periodicals like P\u00fcrag, Hanrakidag, P\u00fczantion and Panaser. She was not even twenty years of age when she was awarded second place in a poetry competition organized by the newspaper Masis. In 1905, Mark started to edit the Constantinople-based women\u2019s Armenian magazine Dzaghig (\"Flower\"). At that time, writing workforce in the media is carried out by mostly by men due to the scarcity of women writers. Male writers in the periodical Dzaghig use feminine pen names. Aware of the feminist movements in France, she wanted the magazine to be published only by women and for women. In the meantime, she married to Vahan Toshigyan, editorial director of the periodical Manz\u00fbme-i Efk\u00e2r, and quit her job at the orphanage. The periodical continued to be published two years more, but folded when Mark followed her husband to Smyrna. There, she wrote on women's issues at the local magazines Ar\u015faluys (\"Dawn\") and Arevelk (\"Orient\"). In 1909, the couple returned to Constantinople. Mark became the head of the Literary Commission of the recently-founded \"Nationalist Armenian Women's Union\". She got ready to open up Armenian schools in the province and to provide education of girls. As a result of these efforts, the number of Armenian schools in Anatolia increases to 32. In 1919, she started to publish the bi-weekly feminist magazine Hay Gin (, \"Armenian Woman\"). This time, the difference in her attitude is that not only women but both genders should be involved in the publishing of the periodical. She left her idea of separating men and women. She never gave up independence saying \"if the Armenian Woman magazine will live under a flag, this can only be a womanhood flag.\" In 1923, Muhittin \u00dcst\u00fcnda\u011f, a deputy of Istanbul, said in a seminar of the \"Turkish Women's Union\" that \"there is no gender equality because women are not enlisted\". While nobody responded to that, Mark sharply criticized it in the daily Hilal-\u0131 Ahmer (\"Red Crescent\") with the words \"mothers lost their lives during childbirth, and women also serve as a nurse on the battlefields\". Her periodical continued to appear 13 years until 1932, when it was closed down by the Turkish government. It is noted that the paper was forced to close down because it was accused of supporting the \"enemies of the Turks\" for its support of the Allies during the post-World War I years. ==Feminism== Mark opposed \"women becoming male in the name of emancipation\". She said that \"women must work and achieve their economic freedom\", adding \"in doing this, there is no need to be prepared to be rude, to destroy\". According to her \"love is in the mind\". She pointed out that \"the education system is prepared from a male perspective\", and stated that \"involvement of women in the curriculum preparation stage is imperative\". Mark said that \"men and women are different and equal\", adding \"women must claim their differences for themselves and for humanity\". ==Death== Hayganu\u015f Mark died at the age of 81 at Yedikule Armenian Hospital in 1966. At the deathbed, she said to a friend \"Write! Always write for the homeland, nation and humanity and be happy with them!\". She is buried at the \u015ei\u015fli Armenian Cemetery in Istanbul. On her headstone, the title of her magazine \"Hay Gin\" is written. ==References== Category:1884 births Category:1966 deaths Category:Writers from Istanbul Category:Armenian feminists Category:Armenian journalists Category:Armenian women writers Category:Armenian-language women poets Category:Armenians of the Ottoman Empire Category:19th-century Armenian people Category:20th-century Armenian people Category:20th-century women writers Category:20th-century Armenian poets Category:Burials at \u015ei\u015fli Armenian Cemetery Category:20th- century journalists ",
