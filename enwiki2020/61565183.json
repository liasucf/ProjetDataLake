    "text": "Younique is an American multi-level marketing company (MLM) that markets beauty products. The company was founded in 2012 by Derek Maxfield, who serves as CEO, and Melanie Huscroft, and is headquartered in Lehi, Utah. Between 2017 and 2019, Younique was 60% owned by Coty, Inc. ==Business model== Younique produces cosmetics which are marketed by its \"presenters\", who sign up via the website and purchase products they sell, earning a commission. New sellers must purchase a starter kit for $99 or \u00a369 to begin which includes 17 of Younique's products. Younique sellers are required to continuously purchase products to maintain their status within their company, regardless of whether they are able to sell these products onward. Like other multi-level marketing companies, Younique sellers are encouraged to recruit other people to become presenters. Commissions begin at 20%, and increase to 25% as sellers reach $1000 in total sales. Further increases are only possible if they recruit others as sellers, from whose sales they receive additional commission. As a result, The Guardian described Younique and other MLMs as akin to pyramid schemes, and many Younique participants lose money. The company's business model has been compared to other direct sales companies such as Avon Products and Mary Kay, though with a larger focus on sales via social media. As of December 2017, Younique had 230,000 sellers. Digiday attributed the company's quick growth to its reliance on digital selling, compared to other MLM brands' reliance on in-person sales. Maxfield also used his personal story, involving his Mormon faith and surviving leukemia, to recruit salespeople. ==Products== Younique's product line includes makeup products for eyes, lips, and faces. Younique also has products for skin care, including Younique Royalty that launched in 2016, which is geared towards anti-aging. In 2019, Younique launched an eyelash serum called Moodstruck Epic 4D One-Step Fiber Mascara that sold 1 million units within 6 months. The same year, Younique launched an augmented reality tool that allows buyers to virtually try products before purchase. ==Ownership== Younique was majority owned by Coty, Inc. between 2017 and 2019. Coty purchased a 60% stake in Younique for $600 million in January 2017. This acquisition valued Younique at $1 billion. Younique's founders continue to own 40% of the company. The acquisition increased Coty's profits in 2018, with Younique witnessing double-digit sales growth in its second quarter. However, Younique's revenues and profits declined year-over-year in 2019, with Coty attributing the weakness to decreasing hype, a complex business structure, increased consumer awareness of the risks of participating in MLM schemes, and Facebook's algorithm changes. Coty announced that it was cutting ties with Younique in August 2019, saying that Younique was \"definitely different\" from other businesses owned by Coty. Coty intended to sell its 60% stake in Younique back to its founders. ==References== Category:Retail companies established in 2012 Category:Multi-level marketing companies Category:2012 establishments in Utah Category:Coty, Inc.
