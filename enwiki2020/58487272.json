    "text": "milk bread made with a water roux Water roux (, ) (\u6e6f\u7a2e) is a paste of flour cooked in water or milk which is used to improve the texture of bread, making it soft and fluffy. For tangzhong the flour is cooked at 65\u00b0C in the liquid which causes its starch to gelatinize. For yudane the flour is mixed with an equal weight of boiling water poured over it. This mixture then holds moisture so that, when it is added to a bread mix, the dough bakes with a soft, fluffy texture and the bread then keeps for longer. When the gelatinized roux is refrigerated it apparently also contributes to slightly greater rise during baking. ==See also== * Roux ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Baking ",
