In reality, Takion was created as an Avatar of Highfather, as a security measure in the event of Highfather's death. In that moment, Takion was able to see everything, all his failures and victories, time was without boundary. He was even able to foresee Highfather's death. While trying to deal with the ebb and flow of energy through his body into and out of the Source, Josh attracts the attention of Captain Atom, the Flash, Green Lantern; after a brief fight, he easily defeats all three heroes and leaves the planet feeling that with his immense power levels, he was a threat to everyone on Earth.Takion #2, August 1996 ===Cosmic awareness=== The problem was that unlike a New God, Takion has cosmic awareness but has to filter this awareness and all the information it brought using the primitive thought structures of a human brain. This dissonance was making him unstable. He spent his time in space learning how to separate the future and past from the present, and forcing his awareness to exist only in the present. He allowed his body to discorporate so that he could re-assemble himself, which is when he first discovered the ability to possess others, read their minds and also their potential timeline and destiny. Takion also learned how to accept and use his cosmic awareness.Takion #3, September 1996 ===Stayne=== Takion's main nemesis is Stayne, his dark counterpart who was a nameless human woman transformed by Darkseid's power.

Scott turns the offer down, leaving Takion to become the new Highfather. During a crisis, he asks for guidance from Highfather, who had become one with the Source.
