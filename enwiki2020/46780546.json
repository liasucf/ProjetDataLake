He was a translator of psalms and catechetical texts, promoter of post-Tridentine Catholicism, and a poet. == Early life == Budini\u0107 was born in Zadar in the period between 1530 and 1535 in a family that originated from the Zadar hinterland. His father was a goldsmith whose name was Mihovil and his mother Klara was from the De Sanctis family. He was most likely educated by the Franciscans from Zadar, and knew both the Glagolitic and Cyrillic scripts well. It is assumed that he completed elementary and humanist education in Zadar, and higher education in Padua. Budini\u0107 became a Catholic priest in Zadar and advanced to the position of canon in 1560. Scholars disagree whether or not Budini\u0107 attended the Council of Trent. For many years Budini\u0107 was a notary in Zadar and chancellor in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zadar. As chancellor he wrote official documents using the Glagolitic script. While Budini\u0107 was a notary he had a lot of spare time which he used to read love songs. He is first mentioned in documents in 1556. Between 1559 and 1561 he wrote verses of love songs in dodecasyllable, seven of them still preserved, some of them in honor of Pelegrinovi\u0107's Je\u0111upka. At that time he also authored one short Latin language satire which subject were cheated husbands. Budini\u0107 was a light-headed young priest who was even temporary expelled from Catholicism because of his misconduct, after he was reported for beating one of his fellow priests who swore his parents. Thanks to the influence of his family, this excommunication was abolished without endangering the advance in his career. In 1570 Budini\u0107 was appointed as chaplain of the Chapel of Saint Lucia on the island Pag and in 1577 he became chief vicar of the Archdiocese of Zadar. == Chakavian period == In June 1581, Budini\u0107 travelled to Rome at the invitation of the Holy See to promote counter-reformation policy. According to one 1626 letter, Pope Gregory XIII invited Budini\u0107 to Rome to translate Catichesis of Peter Canisius to Illyrian language using Illyrian characters. Pope Gregory XIII ordered Budini\u0107 to prepare Roman Catholic Catechism using Illyrian language and characters. It is unclear if Pope ordered any particular script. Although it is confirmed by many contemporary documents that Pope indeed ordered Budini\u0107 to prepare Roman Catholic Catechism using Illyrian language and characters it remain unclear if Pope ordered any particular script. When Budini\u0107 arrived to Rome he became a confessor in Pontifical Croatian College of St. Jerome where he worked on improvement of the Glagolitic missals and breviaries. During his stay in Rome Budini\u0107 wrote his first two books on the pure Croatian language of the Chakavian dialect. According to one 1581 Vatican document, Budini\u0107 was preparing a translation in the Serbian language (), which at that time in the Vatican and Dubrovnik was a term used for Cyrillic script, the preferred language for Vatican documents to be published regarding Slavic language. == Shtokavian period and orthographic reform == Budini\u0107's intention was, from reasons of propaganda, to employ language and orthography that could penetrate and be understood in all of what was then the southern reaches of the Slavic people. Budini\u0107 attempted a daring orthographic reform and authored a version of the Latin script based on the Cyrillic and Glagolitic scripts, using diacritics (namely \u010d and \u017e) from the Czech orthography of Jan Hus in his 1582 work. Some authors believed that Budini\u0107, being promoter of Counter- Reformation, would never use orthography of Jan Hus who was a key predecessor to the Protestant Reformation. Under the influence of Jesuit priest Peter Canisius, Budini\u0107 abandoned the language he had been using in his 1582 work, and instead used a mixture of the Shtokavian Serbo-Croatian, Church Slavonic, Czech, and Polish languages. Budini\u0107 referred to the language of his work as Slavonic. Budini\u0107 then published translations of Canisius' work in 1583 (Summa nauk Kristjanski) in two versions, Cyrillic and Latin, and created a complex script based on Ijekavian Shtokavian pronunciation. The Latin script edition was published for clergy while Cyrillic script edition was published for population. Budini\u0107 published Cyrillic script edition with intention to spread this kind of book among South Slavs who were adherents of the Eastern Orthodox Church.: \"Knjigama nabo\u017eno-pou\u010dnoga karaktera B. se uklju\u010duje u tokove protureformacije, a svojim \u0107irili\u010dkim izdanjem Summe nastoji takvu knjigu prenijeti i na ju\u017ene Slavene isto\u010dnog obreda.\" == Legacy == Budini\u0107 died in Zadar on 13 December 1600, around the age of 65. The elementary school in Zadar bears Budini\u0107's name. A square in Zadar was named \u0160ime Budini\u0107\u00b4s Square (). == Bibliography == Bibliography of Budini\u0107's works include: # His own works: ## Love songs written in dodecasyllable, seven of them still preserved, including verses in honor of Pelegrinovi\u0107's Je\u0111upka, Zadar, 1559-1561 ## Short satire which subject were cheated husbands, Latin language, Zadar, 1559-1561 # Translations: ## Katekizam rimski (The Roman Catechism).
