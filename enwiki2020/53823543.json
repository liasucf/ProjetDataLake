In the 24-oz. size, it contains 500 calories, 18 grams of fat, 76 grams of sugar, and 55 milligrams of cholesterol. The drink was available only for a limited time, ending on April 23, 2017. The Unicorn Frappuccino was criticized by the Stratford Health Department for having too much sugar. This was due to the fact that the American Heart Association recommends that women consume of sugar every day, and that men consume of sugar every day. Some saw the \"vibrantly hued, flavor-shifting, color-changing\" drink as part of a larger, social media-fueled embrace of the unicorn in 2017. ==See also== * Unicorn food ==References== Category:Frozen drinks Category:Popular culture about unicorns Category:Products introduced in 2017 Category:Starbucks Category:Fads ",
