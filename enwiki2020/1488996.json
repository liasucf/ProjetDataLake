She was born in Tokyo, Japan and is affectionately referred to as Halko by her fans, a nickname she gave herself which is inspired by HAL 9000, the computer in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey. ==Biography== ===Career=== Haruko took interest in personal computers from a young age and studied personal computer communications during high school. After she graduated from , her articles and writing on her online blog caught the attention of the chief editor of the magazine. She was later offered a job as a writer for the magazine. During the late nineties, Haruko began singing and doing live performances on the streets of Harajuku and Akihabara. She then debuted her single \"Mail Me,\" a cover version of which appears in the movie Suicide Circle in 2000. Soon after, she debuted as a voice actress for her role as Komugi Nakahara in Nurse Witch Komugi. In 2002, she paired with Masaya Koike to form the duo UNDER17 and together performed songs for adult and mainstream video games and anime. After their last album Best Album 3 ~Soshite Densetsu e...~ and a live tour of the same name, UNDER17 separated in 2004 citing creative differences, and the two musicians have since gone their separate ways. She continued on with her solo singing career and in 2006, was signed under avex mode as a music composer and singer. In 2007, Halko published an autobiography entitled Akihaba-LOVE, in which she tells of the major experiences that shaped her life, mainly those that were important in constructing her career as a musician and voice actress, but it also includes anecdotes from her childhood and stories of friendship, as well as personal opinions on different aspects of anime fandom. ==Filmography== ===Anime=== ;2001 *Final Fantasy: Unlimited (Ai Hayakawa) *The SoulTaker (Komugi Nakahara) ;2002 *Ai Yori Aoshi (Chika Minazuki) *Galaxy Angel A (Announcer) *Gravion (Doria) *UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie (Maru) ;2003 *Ai Yori Aoshi:Enishi (Chika Minazuki) *Bottle Fairy (Tama-chan) *Da Capo (Utamaru) *Popotan (Mii) *Mahoromatic: Summer Special (Shi Ho) *Mouse (Samantha Morijima in Ep. 12) ;2004 *DearS (China) *Gravion Zwei (Doria) *Kujibiki Unbalance (Shinobu Enomoto) *Paranoia Agent (Maromi) *Ragnarok The Animation (Maya) *Ry\u016bsei Sentai Musumet (K\u014d Saotome) ;2005 *Da Capo Second Season (Utamaru) ;2006 *Blackjack 21 (Suzie) *Lovely Idol (Mai Nonomiya) *Magikano (Marin Nijihara) ;2007 *Code-E (Keiko Komatsuna) *Prism Ark (Filia) *My Bride Is a Mermaid (San Seto) ;2008 *Mission-E (Keiko Komatsuna) *Tales of the Abyss (Anise Tatlin) ;2011 *Steins;Gate (Faris NyanNyan) ;2014 *Wonder Momo (Original Wonder Momo) ;2017 *Akiba's Trip: The Animation (Momo Tsukumo) ;2018 *Steins;Gate 0 (Faris NyanNyan) ===OVA=== *Majokko Tsukune-chan (Tsukune) *Netrun-mon (Chiyu) *Nurse Witch Komugi (Komugi Nakahara/Magical Nurse Komugi) *Nurse Witch Komugi-Chan Magikarte Z (Komugi Nakahara/Magical Nurse Komugi) *Moekan (Moe no Mikoto) ===Anime Movie=== *Camp Pikachu (Wynaut) ===Tokusatsu=== *Unofficial Sentai Akibaranger (herself) **Unofficial Sentai Akibaranger Season Two (Yuru-Chara Jigen) ===Games=== *Baldr Force EXE (Baschiera) *BALDR BULLET \"REVELLION\" (Asou Natsume) *D.C.P.S.: Da Capo Plus Situation (Utamaru) *D.C.
