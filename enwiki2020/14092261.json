    "text": "KCCL is a commercial classic hits radio station. Licensed to Woodland, California, it broadcasts to Sacramento, California, on 101.5 FM. On March 14, 2013, the city of license changed from Gridley, California to Woodland. Its studios are in North Sacramento and a transmitter site is near Woodland. Sunny 101.5 debuted on August 30, 1996. On August 10, 2011, KMJE replaced KUBA on a translator at 95.5 FM. On February 11, 2013, KMJE became a simulcast of KCCL sister station along with a change in its city of license. On May 30, 2013, officially switched signals and call letters with KMJE, becoming \"101.5 K-Hits,\" but continued to simulcast until a new format on 92.1 FM was unveiled in July 2013. ==Joey Mitchell== Long-time Sacramento radio personality, Joey Mitchell, currently hosts the morning show on KCCL/K-HITS weekdays from 6:00am to 9:00am. Starting in 1969 in Southern California on radio station KVFM located in Panorama City in the San Fernando Valley, Joey gained attention thanks to the 1971 San Fernando 6.6 earthquake. Waking to the 6:00am shaking, Joey ran to the radio station located in the fourteen story Panorama Towers on Van Nuys Blvd. and began broadcasting emergency information to the local community. He was forced to evacuate the tall building by local police when aftershocks deemed the building unsafe. Joey did not leave the studio until he had the police actually order him to, live on the air. That story was heard by KPRO 1440 AM Riverside's general manager Howard Fisher and he immediately offered Joey a job. KPRO was then owned by TV and radio personality Dick Clark and Joey's involvement with the station led to a longtime association with Dick Clark. In 1975, Joey moved his wife and sons to Northern California and Mitchell began 20 years as Sacramento's most-popular morning man with famed country station KRAK. His comedy and antics are legendary. He was named Billboard magazine's \"Best Country DJ\" in 1988 and was nominated again in 1992. Local TV station KXTV named him Sacramento's top radio personality two years-in-a-row. He has been featured in Sacramento Magazine,http://www.sacmag.com/Sacramento-Magazine/September-2007/Radio/ the Sacramento Bee, and other local publications. The State of California once declared a \"Joey Mitchell Day.\" His on-air presence expanded country music's popularity in the Sacramento market. Despite his success at KRAK, he was not immune to the changes on the radio dial. With music on the AM side becoming a rarity, Joey Mitchell joined KHYL-FM, an oldies channel, where \"Mitchell and Company\" was able to raise station ratings. When the new KRAK-FM with a country oldies format went on-the-air, Mitchell was brought aboard as the morning man. But continued movement on the FM dial and an eventual move to 1470AM would prove confusing to listeners. Even Joey Mitchell would find himself doing \"afternoon drive.\" To keep up with all the changes, Willie Nelson's \"On The Road Again\" would receive substantial airplay. After the final demise of KRAK, he would returning to playing oldies, first at KOOL 101.9, now at KCCL/K-HITS 92.1. Joey Mitchell also owns his own advertising and production company, known as \"Joey Mitchell Productions.\" ==Big Jim Hall== Big Jim Hall, a veteran of 45 years on the Sacramento airwaves, hosted the afternoon show on KCCL/K-HITS weekdays from 4:00pm to 6:00pm from 2007 through 2017. Called the \"World's tallest disc jockey,\" Big Jim started his radio career at Merced's KYOS-AM before moving to Sacramento's KROY. But it was at the legendary country station, KRAK-AM, where Big Jim Hall found his greatest fame. For two decades he held the 2-6:00PM afternoon \"drive\" and like his friend and colleague, Joey Mitchell, was responsible for increasing the interest of country music in the greater Sacramento market. After KRAK flipped its format, Hall moved to smooth jazz-oriented KSSJ then joined the original KCCL \"KOOL 101.9\" as the \"Midday Mayor.\" After this station flipped to a modern country format in 2007, both Hall and Mitchell joined the new KCCL. Big Jim Hall stands 6' 7\" and has made commercials for \"Wagner's Big and Tall,\" \"Yardbirds,\" \"Denio's Farmers Market and Auction,\" and \"Folsom Chevrolet.\" He currently represents \"Hall's Window Center\" and \"Big Mountain Heating and Air.\" Hall is also a familiar face and voice on Sacramento's PBS station, KVIE, and is a ring announcer for professional boxing in the region. Big Jim has long been very active in church, charitable, and community activities. ==References== ==External links== *Results Radio Website *Official Website CCL Category:Classic hits radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1996 Category:1996 establishments in California ",
