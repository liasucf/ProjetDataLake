    "text": "Olive Carey (born Olive Fuller Golden, January 31, 1896 \u2013 March 13, 1988) was an American film and television actress. ==Life and career== Carey was born Olive Fuller Golden in New York City, the daughter of Ada (Maxwell), who was from Surrey, and George Fuller Golden (originally George Michael Fuller), a vaudeville entertainer. In 1912, her father died, \"leaving a wife and four children destitute.\" She had a sister, Ruth Fuller Golden, who also acted in films. == Film == Carey's screen debut was in Sorrowful Jones (1913). She next acted in Tess of the Storm Country (1914). (An obituary indicates that the name of her initial film was The Sorrowful Shore.) She appeared in more than 50 films, mostly westerns, including Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, often playing tough tomboy parts. == Television == In 1956, Carey guest starred in the episode \"Death in the Snow\" of NBC's anthology series, The Joseph Cotten Show. In 1957 and 1958, Carey played Elsie, the live-in housekeeper, on the CBS sitcom Mr. Adams and Eve, which starred the then real-life married acting couple, Howard Duff and Ida Lupino. She subsequently appeared on the CBS sitcom Dennis the Menace, starring Jay North. About this time, Carey was cast on two NBC westerns Cimarron City, with George Montgomery and John Smith, and The Restless Gun, starring John Payne. In 1960 and 1961, Carey performed the role of Casey, Macdonald Carey's (no relation) secretary, in several episodes of the television series Lock-Up. On November 7, 1961, Carey played Ma Tolliver, the owner of a former stagecoach stop, in the episode \"Deadly Is the Night\" of NBC's Laramie western series. On April 22, 1962, she delivered a noteworthy performance as a bullying mother, \"Ma\" Martin, of three grown sons in the episode \"The Youngest\" of the ABC-Warner Brothers western series, Lawman. == Personal life == In 1920, she wed actor Harry Carey, with whom she remained until his death in 1947. They had two children, a daughter Ellen and a son, actor Harry Carey, Jr. In 1928, the failure of the St. Francis Dam northwest of Los Angeles caused a flood, the damages of which included seven deaths on the Careys' ranch and a loss estimated at $750,000 ($ million today). As a result, when Carey died in 1947, his estate was worth only about $15,000 ($ today). == Death == Carey died of natural causes at the age of 92 at her home in Carpinteria, California. ==Filmography== *The Sorrowful Shore (1913) \u2013 The Orphan *Tess of the Storm Country (1914) \u2013 Teola Graves *When the Gods Played a Badger Game (1915) \u2013 Marie \u2013 a Chorus Girl *Such Is Life (1915) \u2013 Olive Trent *Just Jim (1915) \u2013 Aunt Mary *The Millionaire Paupers (1915) *The Frame-Up (1915) \u2013 Nell Harter *A Knight of the Range (1916) \u2013 Bess Dawson *Stampede in the Night (1916) \u2013 Nell Wilson *The Night Riders (1916) \u2013 Jennie Marston \u2013 the Sheriff's Sister *The Passing of Hell's Crown (1916) \u2013 Rose Graney *The Wedding Guest (1916) \u2013 Panchita *The Committee on Credentials (1916) \u2013 Josephine *For the Love of a Girl (1916) \u2013 Jane Buckley \u2013 Cliff's Daughter *Love's Lariat (1916) \u2013 Goldie Le Croix *A Woman's Eyes (1916) \u2013 Sunny Baker *The Devil's Own (1916) \u2013 Vera Browning *The Yellow Pawn (1916) *Trader Horn (1931) \u2013 Edith Trent *The Vanishing Legion (1931, Serial) \u2013 Nurse Lewis [Chs. 9\u201312] *Border Devils (1932) \u2013 Ethel Denham *Naughty Marietta (1935) \u2013 Madame Renavant (uncredited) *The Whip Hand (1951) \u2013 Mabel Turner *On Dangerous Ground (1951) \u2013 Mrs. Brent *Monkey Business (1952) \u2013 Johnny's Mother (uncredited) *Face to Face (1952) \u2013 Laura Lee ('The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky') *Affair with a Stranger (1953) \u2013 Cynthia Craig *Rogue Cop (1954) \u2013 Selma *The Cobweb (1955) \u2013 Mrs. O'Brien \u2013 Nurse *I Died a Thousand Times (1955) \u2013 Ma Goodhue *The Searchers (1956) \u2013 Mrs. Jorgenson *Pillars of the Sky (1956) \u2013 Mrs. Anne Avery *The Wings of Eagles (1957) \u2013 Bridy O'Faolain (uncredited) *Gunfight at the O.K.
