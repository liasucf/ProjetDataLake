    "text": "Origen's Philokalia is an anthology of Origen's texts, probably compiled by Basil the Great and Gregory Nazianzen. It was probably compiled during their monastic retreat in Pontus in the late 350s to early 360s, or in any event early in their careers and before their own theological writings.Peter C. Bouteneff, Beginnings: ancient Christian readings of the biblical creation narratives, Baker Academic (2008) p.128. The complete text of so much of Origen's work is lost, and consequently the extracts in the anthology are valuable today.George Lewis, The Philocalia of Origen, Edinburgh: T. & T. Clark, 1911. Translator's preface: \"The wholesale destruction of his writings which followed upon the warfare waged against his opinions shortly after his death, has caused a special value to attach to the Philocalia as preserving to us in the original much of Origen's work which would otherwise have been entirely lost, or would have survived only in the translations of Rufinus. Moreover, even his great and comparatively popular work against Celsus depends for its text solely on a manuscript of the thirteenth century, so that we have a cause for gratitude in the preservation of a large part of it in the Philocalia.\" It should not be confused with the medieval Philokalia. The work is divided into twenty-seven chapters, with titles given by the compilers. About a fifth of it is taken from Contra Celsum. Opinion is divided about who compiled the Philokalia. Basil and Gregory are described as the compilers in the Greek text itself,See translation of the Greek introduction in George Lewis' translation here. and this is generally accepted. Eric Junod, the editor of the French edition of chapters 21\u201327, accepts both as the authors.Orig\u00e8ne, Philocalie 21-27, Sources Chr\u00e9tiennes tome 226, Paris (1976), p. 11-13. Greek critical text, translation and notes. But M. Harl, editor of chapters 1\u201320 in the same series, questions this,Orig\u00e8ne, Philocalie 1-20, Sources Chr\u00e9tiennes tome 302, Paris (1983), p. 19-24. Greek critical text, translation and notes. as do others. Gregory Nazianzen sent a letter to a friend Gregory Nazianzen, Letter 115, To Theodore: \"I have sent you a little book, the Philocalia of Origen, as a remembrance of me and of the holy Basil.\" which supports the traditional attribution.Authorship discussion and references from Jennifer Nimmo Smith, A Christian's guide to Greek culture: the Pseudo-Nonnus Commentaries, p.xx, n.17.
