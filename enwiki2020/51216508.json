    "text": "Fishtrap is an extinct town in Lincoln County, in the U.S. state of Washington. The GNIS classifies it as a populated place. A post office called Fishtrap was established in 1906 on land owned by John W. Lawton, and remained in operation until 1936. The community was originally called Vista, but it took its name from the nearby Fishtrap Lake, which was named that because Indians had natural traps to catch fish there. The name was suggested by Mr. Lawton. ==References== Category:Ghost towns in Washington (state) Category:Geography of Lincoln County, Washington ",
