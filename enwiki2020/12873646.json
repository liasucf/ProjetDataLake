    "text": "In mathematics, a porous set is a concept in the study of metric spaces. Like the concepts of meagre and measure zero sets, a porous set can be considered \"sparse\" or \"lacking bulk\"; however, porous sets are not equivalent to either meagre sets or measure zero sets, as shown below. ==Definition== Let (X, d) be a complete metric space and let E be a subset of X. Let B(x, r) denote the closed ball in (X, d) with centre x \u2208 X and radius r > 0\\. E is said to be porous if there exist constants 0 < \u03b1 < 1 and r0 > 0 such that, for every 0 < r \u2264 r0 and every x \u2208 X, there is some point y \u2208 X with :B(y, \\alpha r) \\subseteq B(x, r) \\setminus E. A subset of X is called \u03c3-porous if it is a countable union of porous subsets of X. ==Properties== * Any porous set is nowhere dense. Hence, all \u03c3-porous sets are meagre sets (or of the first category). * If X is a finite-dimensional Euclidean space Rn, then porous subsets are sets of Lebesgue measure zero. * However, there does exist a non- \u03c3-porous subset P of Rn which is of the first category and of Lebesgue measure zero. This is known as Zaj\u00ed\u010dek's theorem. * The relationship between porosity and being nowhere dense can be illustrated as follows: if E is nowhere dense, then for x \u2208 X and r > 0, there is a point y \u2208 X and s > 0 such that ::B(y, s) \\subseteq B(x, r) \\setminus E. : However, if E is also porous, then it is possible to take s = \u03b1r (at least for small enough r), where 0 < \u03b1 < 1 is a constant that depends only on E. ==References== * * Category:Metric geometry ",
