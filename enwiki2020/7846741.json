    "text": "Rapid River is a U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high- resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed June 30, 2011 river in the northwestern portion of the US state of Maine flowing from Lower Richardson Lake to Umbagog Lake. Despite its short length, it forms the end of a major portion of the Umbagog Lake and Androscoggin River watersheds. Much of this watershed is covered by (from downstream to upstream) Lower and Upper Richardson Lakes, Mooselookmeguntic Lake, Cupsuptic Lake and Rangeley Lake. The major tributaries of this system are the Cupsuptic, Kennebago and Rangeley rivers, all of which flow into Cupsuptic Lake. True to its name, Rapid River contains class III\u2013IV rapids for most of its length, including some good spots for playboating and riverboarding. Locals omit the word \"the\" when referring to the river. For example, \"I went kayaking on Rapid River\" not \"I went kayaking on the Rapid River.\" ==See also== *List of rivers of Maine ==References== == External links == * Category:Tributaries of the Kennebec River Category:Rivers of Oxford County, Maine Category:North Maine Woods Category:Northern Forest Canoe Trail Category:Rivers of Maine ",
