Wildsmith signed a -year professional contract with Sheffield Wednesday in November 2013 after impressing with the club's youth teams. Throughout the 2014\u201315 season, Wildsmith appeared four times as an unused substitute bench. Wildsmith made his Owls debut in Wednesday's 4\u20131 League Cup win over Mansfield Town at Hillsborough on 11 August 2015. On 28 August 2015, he signed a new two-year contract with the club keeping him until the summer of 2017. Two weeks later on 15 September 2015, Wildsmith kept his first clean sheet, in a 0\u20130 draw against Bolton Wanderers. He then made further League cup starts against Premier League giants Newcastle United and Arsenal, claiming clean sheets and wins over both teams. Wildsmith broke into the first-team under new manager Carlos Carvalhal, as Keiren Westwood was injured and Chris Kirkland had left for Preston North End. As a result, he made his return to the starting line\u2013up as a first choice goalkeeper, keeping a clean sheet, in a 3\u20130 win against Birmingham City. This was followed up by starting in the next three matches, including earning his fourth clean sheet of the season against Fulham on 2 January 2016. However, Wildsmith suffered a back injury that kept him out for two months. After recovering from injury, he returned to the substitute bench and didn\u2019t make an appearance until on 9 April 2016, starting the whole game, in a 4\u20131 loss against Bristol City. At the end of the 2015\u201316 season, Wildsmith went on to make fourteen appearances in all competitions. Ahead of the 2016\u201317 season Wildsmith was featured in the two out of the five pre\u2013season matches for the side. He made his first appearance of the season, starting and played 120 minutes, in a 2\u20131 loss against Cambridge United in the first round of the League Cup. However, Wildsmith found himself as the club\u2019s second choice goalkeeper and placed on the substitute bench throughout the season, even he faced his own injury concern. Despite, Wildsmith appeared two times against Middlesbrough and Fulham. At the end of the 2016\u201317 season, he made three appearances for the side in all competitions. Following this, the club opted to take up their option of a contract extension that would ensure Wildsmith remained under contract for the 2017\u201318 season. At the start of the 2017\u201318 season, Wildsmith appeared in three matches (playing once in the league and twice in the League Cup). He then signed a five year contract with Sheffield Wednesday, keeping him until 2022. Wildsmith then made his return to the starting line\u2013up against Birmingham City on 27 September 2017, as they lost 1\u20130. Following this, he started in the next two matches, including earning a clean sheet against Leeds United on 1 October 2017. After spending two months returning to the substitute bench, Wildsmith didn\u2019t return to the starting line\u2013up until on 15 December 2017 against Wolverhampton Wanderers, losing 1\u20130. Since returning to the first team, he regained his first choice goalkeeper role for the rest of the season. Wildsmith then kept four consecutive clean sheets for the club between 6 January 2018 and 30 January 2018. Wildsmith continued to remain as the club\u2019s first choice goalkeeper until he was dropped in favour of Cameron Dawson for the remaining matches of the 2017\u201318 season. At the end of the 2017\u201318 season, Wildsmith made twenty\u2013nine appearances in all competitions. Ahead of the 2018\u201319 season, Wildsmith said he\u2019s ready to fight for his place for the first choice goalkeeper role. However, Manager Jos Luhukay stated while he preferred Cameron Dawson as the first choice keeper in the league, though he would put Wildsmith as a keeper in cup competitions. Luhukay eventually did put Wildsmith in goal for the League matches, starting against Sunderland and Wolverhampton Wanderers. However, he spent the rest of the 2018\u201319 season, placed on the substitute bench, with Dawson and Westwood preferred to be used in goal under the of both Luhukay and Steve Bruce and made two appearances in all competitions. Ahead of the 2019\u201320 season, Wildsmith was linked a move away from Sheffield Wednesday, but he responded to the transfer speculation by staying at the club. However, Wildsmith suffered a knock and was substituted during a 2\u20131 loss against VfB L\u00fcbeck in a friendly match on 19 July 2019. As a result, he was sidelined for almost the rest of the 2019. By December, Wildsmith returned from injury and then assigned to the substitute bench for the next four months for the side. It wasn\u2019t until on 4 March 2020 when he made his first appearance of the season, in a 1\u20130 loss against Manchester City in the fifth round of the FA Cup.

For the remaining matches of the 2019\u201320 season, he became the club\u2019s first choice goalkeeper. Wildsmith then kept two consecutive clean sheets between 11 July 2020 and 14 July 2020. At the end of the 2019\u201320 season, he went on to make ten appearances in all competitions. ===Loan Spells=== On 29 March 2014, Wildsmith was loaned out to Alfreton Town for the rest of the 2013\u201314 season.
