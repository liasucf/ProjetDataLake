Yog\u0101c\u0101ra-Svatantrika-M\u0101dhyamika), which united the Madhyamaka tradition of Nagarjuna, the Yogacara tradition of Asanga, and the logical and epistemological thought of Dharmakirti. \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita was instrumental in the introduction of Buddhism and the Sarvastivadin monastic ordination lineage to Tibet which was conducted at Samye. His philosophic views were the main views in Tibet from the 8th century until it was mostly supplanted by Je Tsongkhapa's interpretation of Prasa\u1e45gika Madhyamaka in the 15th century. In the late 19th century, Ju Mipham attempted to promote his views again as part of the Rim\u00e9 movement and as a way to discuss specific critiques of Je Tsongkhapa's interpretation of Prasa\u1e45gika. ==Biography== There are few historical records of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, with most available material being from hagiographic sources. Some of his history is detailed in a 19th-century commentary by Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso drawn from sources like the Blue Annals, Buton Rinchen Drub and Taranatha. \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita was the son of the king of Zahor.Shantarakshita & Ju Mipham (2005) pp.2\u20133 Born in Rewalsar,Omacanda H\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101, Buddhist Western Himalaya: A politico-religious history, Indus Publishing, p. 314 in the modern-state of Himachal Pradesh in India, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita was brought to Tibetan Empire at the instigation of Emperor Trisong Detsen sometime before 767 CE. One account details his first trip as unsuccessful and he spent six years in Nepal before returning to Tibet.Contribution of Indian Buddhists in Nepal Once established in Tibet, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita oversaw the translation of a large body of scriptures into Tibetan. He oversaw the construction of the first Buddhist monastery at Samye in 787 CE and ordained the first monastics there. He stayed at Samye Monastery for the rest of his life, another 13 years after its completion, and this was considered significant by Tibetans later that he stayed and did not return to India. It is said that he was kicked to death by a horse.Banerjee, 1982 P.5 Also, in some accounts he left Tibet for a time due to the antipathy of Bonpos and interference from local spirits. ==Tibetan teachings== \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita focused his early teachings in Tibet, directed to the 'seven that were tested', upon the 'ten virtues' (; Sanskrit: da\u015baku\u015bala; Pali: dasa sikkhapadani or dasa sila) and 'the chain of casual relation' (). The ten virtues are the opposite of the 'ten non-virtues' (; Sanskrit: da\u015b\u0101ku\u015bala). ==Writings== ===Madhyamakalamkara=== \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita's synthesis of Madhyamaka, Yogacara, and Pramana was expounded in his text Madhyamak\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101ra. In the short verse text of the Madhyamak\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101ra, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita details his two truths doctrine philosophical synthesis of the conventional truth of the Yogacara philosophy, with the ultimate truth of the Madhyamaka, with the assistance of Buddhist logic, with a protracted discussion of the argument of \"neither one nor many\". In his synthesis text, readers are advised to adopt Madhyamaka view and approach from Nagarjuna and Aryadeva when analysing for ultimacy and to adopt the mind-only views of the Yogacarans Asanga and Vasubandhu when considering conventional truth. He also incorporates the logic approach of valid cognition and the Sautrantika views of Dign\u0101ga and Dharmakirti. Within the Yogacara in that text he also included the Sautr\u0101ntika and \"consciousness- only\" Yogacara views specifically when referring to \"conventional truth\", one of the two truths doctrine. His view is therefore categorised as \"Yogacara- Svatantrika-Madhyamaka\" by later Tibetans, but he did not refer to himself that way. ===Tattvasa\u1e43graha=== \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita is also known for his text Tattvasa\u1e43graha (Compendium on Reality), which is a more encyclopaedic treatment of the major philosophic views of the time and survived in translation in Tibet. A Sanskrit version of this work was discovered in 1873 by Dr. G. B\u00fchler in the Jain temple of P\u0101r\u015bva at Jaisalmer. This version contains also the commentary by \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita's pupil Kamala\u015b\u012bla. ==Influence== ===Students=== *Haribhadra (Buddhist philosopher) *Kamala\u015b\u012bla ===Rim\u00e9 movement=== \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita's philosophic views were the main views in Tibet from the 8th century until the 15th century, when it was mostly supplanted by Je Tsongkhapa's interpretation of Prasa\u1e45gika Madhyamaka.Shantarakshita & Ju Mipham (2005) pp.5\u20136, 12\u201316 In the late 19th century, Ju Mipham attempted to promote his views again as part of the Rim\u00e9 movement and as a way to discuss specific critiques of Je Tsongkhapa's interpretation of Prasa\u1e45gika. The Rim\u00e9 movement was funded by the secular authorities in Derge, Kham, and began to establish centres of learning encouraging the study of traditions different from the dominant Gelug tradition in central Tibet. This Rim\u00e9 movement revitalised the Sakya, Kagyu, Nyingma and Jonang traditions, which had been by almost supplanted by the Gelug hegemony.Shantarakshita & Ju Mipham (2005) pp.4\u20135 As part of that movement the 19th century Nyingma scholar Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso wrote the first commentary in almost 400 years about \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita's Madhyamakalankara. According to his student Kunzang Palden, Mipham had been asked by his teacher Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo to write a survey of all the major Mahayana philosophic shastras for use in the Nyingma monastic colleges. Mipham's commentaries now form the backbone of the Nyingma monastic curriculum. The Madhyamakalankara, which was almost forgotten by the 19th century, is now studied by all Nyingma shedra students. ==References== ==Sources== * Banerjee, Anukul Chandra.
