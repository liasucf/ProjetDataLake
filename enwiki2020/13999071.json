His seat was near Altai mountains. In 630, after Eastern Turkic Khaganate collapsed and the Illig Qaghan Ashina Duobi were captured by Tang Dynasty forces commanded by Li Jing, Xueyantuo, formerly an Eastern Turkic vassal, took over most of Eastern Turkic Khaganate's former lands. Some Eastern Turkic Khaganate remnants wanted to declare Ashina Hubo the khan of Eastern Turkic Khaganate, but due to Xueyantuo's strength, Ashina Hubo did not dare to declare himself khan but instead surrendered to Xueyantuo. However, because Ashina Hubo was considered intelligent and capable, Xueyantuo was apprehensive of Ashina Hubo and wanted to kill him. When Ashina Hubo heard this, he fled north and gathered his people, declaring himself the Yizhuchebi Khan (or Chebi Khan in short). He made periodic pillaging attacks against Xueyantuo and gradually grew stronger. == Reign == In 646, Tang and Huige forces destroyed Xueyantuo and Ashina Hubo grew stronger, submitting Yenisei Kyrgyz and Karluks. In 647, he sent his son Ashina Shaboluo (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u6c99\u9262\u7f85) to China to greet Emperor Taizong of Tang and offering to visit Emperor Taizong himself. Emperor Taizong sent the generals An Diaozhe (\u5b89\u8abf\u906e) and Han Hua (\u97d3\u83ef) to escort Ashina Hubo, but once they arrived at Ashina Hubo's headquarters, they realized that Ashina Hubo had no intention of visiting Chang'an, despite strong advocacy by Ashina Hubo's son Ashina Jieman (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u7faf\u6f2b). Han conspired with Ashina Hubo's vassal tribe Karluk (\u845b\u908f\u797f) and their chief Nishu K\u00fcl Elteber to seize Ashina Hubo and take him back to Tang. When Ashina Hubo discovered this, Ashina Hubo's son Ashina Zhebi (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u965f\u82fe) killed Han in combat, and An was also killed. Ashina Jieman, who had command of a substantial portion of Ashian Hubo's people, instead sent his own son Ashina Anshuo (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u83f4\u9460) to Tang to show submission. == Capture == In anger, in 649 Emperor Taizong sent the general Gao Kan, supplemented by forces from Uighur (Ch. Huige) and Pugu (\u50d5\u9aa8) tribes, made a surprise attack on Ashina Hubo. Once Gao's forces entered Eastern Turkic territory, Eastern Turkic vassals began to surrender, as did Ashina Jieman. In 650, Gao approached Ashina Hubo's headquarters, and Ashina Hubo tried to summon the vassal tribes for aid, but drew no response. He tried to flee with his favorite concubine, but was captured by Gao. Gao took him back to Chang'an, where he was spared by Emperor Taizong's son and successor Emperor Gaozong and given a general title. His territory was divided under three Tang commandants and 24 prefectures, with various tribal chiefs as commandants and prefects. There were no further historical records about Ashina Hubo, including when he died. == Issue == * Ashina Shaboluo (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u6c99\u9262\u7f85) * Ashina Jieman (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u7faf\u6f2b) ** Ashina Anshuo (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u83f4\u9460) * Ashina Zhebi (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u965f\u82fe) == References == === Citations === === Sources === * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 198, 199. * Old Book of Tang, vol. 194, part 1. * New Book of Tang, vol. 215, part 1.
