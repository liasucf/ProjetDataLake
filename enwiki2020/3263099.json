    "text": "1909 illustrations by Alois Lunzer depicting apple cultivars Golden Sweet, Talmon Sweet, Bailey Sweet and Sweet Bough Over 7,500 cultivars of the culinary or eating apple (Malus pumila) are known. Some are extremely important economically as commercial products, though the vast majority are not suitable for mass production. In the following list, use for \"eating\" means that the fruit is consumed raw, rather than cooked. Cultivars used primarily for making cider are indicated. Those varieties marked have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. This list does not include the species and varieties of apples collectively known as crab apples, which are grown primarily for ornamental purposes, though they may be used to make jelly. These are described under Malus. ==Table of apples== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Common name ! Image ! Origin ! First developed ! Comment !

Most modern commercial orchards use one of the \"Malling series\" (aka 'M' series), introduced or developed by the East Malling Research Station from the early 20th century onward. However, a great deal of work has been done recently introducing new rootstocks in Poland, the U.S. (Geneva), and other nations. The Polish rootstocks are often used where cold hardiness is needed. The Geneva series of rootstocks has been developed to resist important diseases such as fireblight and collar rot, as well as for high fruit productivity. ==See also== * Cooking apple * Lists of cultivars * List of apple dishes * List of Japanese apple cultivars * Welsh Apples * * ==References== Khanizadeh, S. and J.
