    "text": "The Rose Bowl, under floodlights, for the final of the 2010 Friends Provident t20, which Somerset lost. Somerset County Cricket Club have played first- class cricket continuously since 1891, and limited overs cricket since its introduction in 1963. English domestic cricket only ever staged finals in limited overs competitions prior to the abridged 2020 season: the first being the 1963 Gillette Cup Final. Somerset reached their first final in 1967, losing to Kent in the same competition. In total, Somerset have appeared in sixteen finals, of which they won seven and lost nine. Their first victory came in the 1979 Gillette Cup Final, which was followed by three more victories in the following four years. After winning the 1983 NatWest Trophy Final, Somerset did not appear in another final until 1999, when they lost to Yorkshire in the same competition. After winning four of their first six finals, Somerset have only won three of their eleven since. The club finished as runners-up in both domestic finals in each of 2010 and 2011, losing the Friends Provident t20 in 2010 courtesy of having lost more wickets after the match was tied. ==Finals== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" !No. !Season !Competition !Date !Opponents !Venue !Result ! class=\"unsortable\" | Ref |- | 1 || 1967 || Gillette Cup || || Kent || Lord's, London || bgcolor=\"#ffdddd\" | Lost by 32 runs || |- | 2 || 1978 || Gillette Cup || || Sussex || Lord's, London || bgcolor=\"#ffdddd\" | Lost by 5 wickets || |- | 3 || 1979 || Gillette Cup || || Northamptonshire || Lord's, London || bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\" | Won by 45 runs || |- | 4 || 1981 || Benson & Hedges Cup || || Surrey || Lord's, London || bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\" | Won by 7 wickets || |- | 5 || 1982 || Benson & Hedges Cup || || Nottinghamshire || Lord's, London || bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\" | Won by 9 wickets|| |- | 6 || 1983 || NatWest Trophy || || Kent || Lord's, London || bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\" | Won by 24 runs || |- | 7 || 1999 || NatWest Trophy || || Gloucestershire || Lord's, London || bgcolor=\"#ffdddd\" | Lost by 50 runs || |- | 8 || 2001 || Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy || || Leicestershire || Lord's, London || bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\" | Won by 41 runs || |- | 9 || 2002 || Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy || || Yorkshire || Lord's, London || bgcolor=\"#ffdddd\" | Lost by 6 wickets || |- | 10 || 2005 || Twenty20 Cup || || Lancashire || The Oval, London || bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\" | Won by 7 wickets || |- | 11 || 2009 || Twenty20 Cup || || Sussex || Edgbaston, Birmingham || bgcolor=\"#ffdddd\" | Lost by 63 runs || |- | 12 || 2010 || Friends Provident t20 || || Hampshire || The Rose Bowl, Southampton || bgcolor=\"#ffdddd\" | Lost by losing more wickets || |- | 13 || 2010 || Clydesdale Bank 40 || || Warwickshire || Lord's, London || bgcolor=\"#ffdddd\" | Lost by 3 wickets || |- | 14 || 2011 || Friends Life t20 || || Leicestershire || Edgbaston, Birmingham || bgcolor=\"#ffdddd\" | Lost by 18 runs|| |- | 15 || 2011 || Clydesdale Bank 40 || || Surrey || Lord's, London || bgcolor=\"#ffdddd\" | Lost by 5 wickets || |- | 16 || 2019 || Royal London One-Day Cup || || Hampshire || Lord's, London || bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\" | Won by 6 wickets || |- | 17 || 2020 || Bob Willis Trophy || || Essex || Lord's, London || bgcolor=\"#ffffdd\" | Match drawn || |} ==References== Category:Somerset County Cricket Club Final ",
