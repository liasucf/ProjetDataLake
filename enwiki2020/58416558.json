    "text": "Andres Rossi (Madrid, 1771 - Seville, 1849) was a Spanish artist. He worked as a painter, draughtsman, print maker, sculptor and writer in Madrid and Seville.Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a; http://datos.bne.es/persona/XX1508565.html == Biography == Jose Andres Rossi was born in Madrid. His surname appears as Rossi, Rosi, Roszi, Roso or Rosso in different texts. The fact that he signed with a double \"s\" suggests an Italian ancestry (though it was often subsequently changed to \"Rosi\" in the inscriptions of many of his prints). Rossi attended the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando in Madrid. In 1799 he placed second in the Academy's yearly competition with his drawing of Publio Furio Filo. He is described as a patriot of the \"Dos de Mayo Uprising\". During the Peninsular War he moved to Seville fleeing from the French. Rossi wrote to King Ferdinand VII twice asking to be considered for a position as a Court painter. His request was ignored both times. In Seville he taught Fine Arts in addition to pursuing his own career as an artist; In 1814 he was named \"Lieutenant Director of Painting\" in the Royal Academy of the Three Noble Arts (now known as the Royal Academy of Fine Arts), where he also lectured. Rossi trained artists such as Juan P\u00e9rez de Villamayor when he arrived in Seville in 1825. In 1829 his role as Lieutenant Director was re-confirmed. In 1835 was asked to join a commission to catalogue art pieces that would be used to create a new museum in Seville along with Juan de Astorga and Jos\u00e9 Dom\u00ednguez Becquer, among others. In 1841, by order of Queen Isabell II (then under Espartero's regency), he also carried out an inventory of paintings from the Academy of the Three Noble Arts. In 1845 he joined the sculpture department in the same academy, along with Juan de Astorga and Jose Maria Gutierrez. == Work == Andres Rossi was a distinguished print maker. His work is generally centred around biblical, military and classical themes, though he was also inspired by other current affairs of the time in prints such as Justice executed on Pedro Pi\u00f1ero aka El Maragato. His patriotic feelings during the Peninsular War are reflected in prints such as Atrocious murders of Spaniards in 'Prado de Madrid'. His print named Cornelia at the Duke's feet can be found in the Museo del Prado, where his print, Allegory of painting, was also shown as part of an exhibition named Spanish drawings from the Hamburger Kunsthalle: Cano, Murillo and Goya. His print named Lady drawing, an exceptional theme as the arts were very restricted to women at the time, can be found at the Museum of Romanticism in Madrid. In addition to his prints, two of his oil paintings have been preserved; a still life, signed \u201cAndr\u00e9s Rossi, the Spaniard\u201d and a religious altarpiece which can be found in the church of El Santo \u00c1ngel in Seville. In 1820 he started writing a treaty which he titled; Spirit of Perspective or Elementary Treaty of Perspective for Artists. The original document is kept in the Museum of Romanticism in Madrid. Furthermore, his contribution to sculpture has also been recorded; the sculpture of Saint Veronica from the El Valle brotherhood paso in Seville has been attributed to him. It was carved in 1815. The original drawing can be found in the Museum of Romanticism in Madrid. The Three Marys from the same paso are attributed to Juan Bautista Patroni. Rossi, along with Francisco Alc\u00e1ntara and Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, presented the Sancha publishing house with series of illustrations for the publication of Cervantes\u2019 Persiles and Sigismunda. However, their offer was rejected and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ximeno y Carrera\u2019s designs were used instead. In 1830 he took part in the renovation of the Alc\u00e1zar of Seville gardens where he painted mythological scenes in the gallery. The paintings represented scenes from Virgil's Aeneid and Theseus in front of the labyrinth. He also took part in the renovation of the Museum square as the art director. This renovation was carried out to celebrate the Queen's wedding. == Timeline of his work == * A man (1790-184-?) Spanish National Library * S. R. S. Fernando (17??)
