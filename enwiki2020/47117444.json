    "text": "Dissent in the Armed Forces of the Empire of Japan refers to dissent within the Armed Forces of the Empire of Japan from the founding of the Empire of Japan in 1868 to the defeat of the Empire of Japan in World War II in 1945. On 26 February 1936, a group of young radical Japanese Army officers led a coup de etat in Japan. Between 1929 and 1942, there were several acts of Communist subversion within the military. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, hundreds of Japanese soldiers defected to the Chinese resistance to Japan and became resistance activists. ==Notable Dissenters== *Sakaguchi Kiichiro *Shigeo Tsutsui ==See also== *Japanese dissidence during the Sh\u014dwa period ==References== ==Further reading== * * \u65e9\u4e59\u5973 \u52dd\u5143 (1991). \u5ef6\u5b89\u304b\u3089\u306e\u624b\u7d19\u2015\u65e5\u672c\u8ecd\u306e\u53cd\u6226\u5175\u58eb\u305f\u3061. \u8349\u306e\u6839\u51fa\u7248\u4f1a. * \u5c0f\u6817 \u52c9 (2010). \u8073\u3086\u308b\u30de\u30b9\u30c8\u2015\u53f2\u4f1d\u5c0f\u8aac. \u304b\u3082\u304c\u308f\u51fa\u7248. ==External links== * \u6226\u524d\u306e\u53cd\u6226\u904b\u52d5 \u300c\u6226\u4e89\u306b\u53cd\u5bfe\u3057\u3066\u3001\u547d\u304c\u3051\u3067\u6d3b\u52d5\u3057\u305f\u4eba\u305f\u3061\u306e\u8a18\u9332\u300d (Pre-war anti-war movement \"Record of the people who were active in the opposition to war.\") at kure-sensai.net.
