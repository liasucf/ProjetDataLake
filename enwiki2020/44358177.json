    "text": "Full Force and Effect (stylized as Tom Clancy Full Force and Effect, Tom Clancy: Full Force and Effect, or Tom Clancy\u2019s Full Force and Effect in the United Kingdom) is a political thriller, written by Mark Greaney and published on December 2, 2014. It is the fifteenth overall entry in the Jack Ryan series and the first such entry to be published after original author Tom Clancy\u2019s death during the previous year, as well as Greaney\u2019s second solo contribution to the franchise. In the novel, President Jack Ryan and The Campus must stop North Korean leader Choi Ji-hoon from developing his country's nuclear weapons program. It debuted at number three in the New York Times bestseller list. ==Plot summary== Supreme Leader of North Korea Choi Ji-hoon wants to develop his country\u2019s nuclear weapons program, but is being hindered by sanctions from the United States and its allies. He tasks his foreign intelligence chief, Ri Tae-jin, with fast-tracking the program in order for the country to be taken more seriously as a superpower. General Ri then arranges for mining to begin in the city of Chongju, where a large deposit of rare-earth minerals has been recently discovered; the profits produced would then be used to fund the nuclear weapons program. He acquires an investor, Mexican mining mogul \u00d3scar Roblas de Mota, who in turn hires Duke Sharps, head of an American corporate espionage and investigations firm, to oversee the mining operation. Meanwhile, the American government becomes concerned about North Korea\u2019s recent test firing of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which had crashed into the Sea of Japan. They push for more sanctions in front of the United Nations. Recognizing the lack of intelligence assets in North Korea, Director of National Intelligence Mary Pat Foley tasks CIA non-official cover operative Adam Yao with infiltrating the Chongju mining operation under cover as a skilled worker. He eventually cultivates an asset in the form of his boss, Hwang Min-ho. Later, a cargo ship bound for North Korea, which carried parts for the ICBM similar to the recently test fired one, was confiscated by the Navy SEALs. As a result, Choi and General Ri arrange for the assassination of U.S. President Jack Ryan, who has been an obstacle to their plan, to be done at his upcoming state visit in Mexico City; they later secure the services of an Iranian bombmaker named Adel Zarif and the Maldonado cartel. Meanwhile, President Ryan arrives in Mexico City and is later injured in the assassination attempt on him; however, he survives. General Ri then sends a hit squad to kill Zarif in order to deny any connection to the North Koreans, but the bombmaker escapes. He then asks Roblas, who then tasks Edward Riley, one of Sharps\u2019s employees, to finish the job for him. This attracts the attention of The Campus, who have been investigating Sharps\u2019s connection to the North Koreans up to this point. They later rescue Zarif from Riley in a secluded villa owned by Roblas in Mexico, although Riley escapes and Campus operator Sam Driscoll dies. Fearing for his life after failing to obtain the nuclear weapons and assassinate President Ryan, General Ri commits suicide, taking his family along with him. Meanwhile, Hwang reaches out to his contact in China, intending to defect. Yao is then tasked with spiriting him and his family out of North Korea via a drone with the ability to carry passengers. The drone does not fit Yao, so he has to escape on his own. He is later rescued by the Chinese, who were contacted by President Ryan. Hwang later leads a coup backed by the Chinese in North Korea, deposing Choi from power. Meanwhile, The Campus tracks down Riley in Thailand and confront him. He tries to escape but later falls to his death. ==Characters== ===United States government=== * Jack Ryan: President of the United States * Scott Adler: Secretary of state * Mary Pat Foley: Director of national intelligence * Jay Canfield: Director of the Central Intelligence Agency * Brian Calhoun: Director of the National Clandestine Service for the Central Intelligence Agency * Robert Burgess: Secretary of defense * Arnold van Damm: President Ryan's chief of staff * Horatio Styles: U.S. ambassador to Mexico * Andrea Price-O'Day: Special agent, U.S. Secret Service * Dale Herbers: Special agent, U.S. Secret Service * Colonel Mike Peters: Regional director, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency * Annette Brawley: Imagery specialist, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency * Adam Yao: CIA non-official cover operative ===The Campus=== * Gerry Hendley: Director of The Campus/Hendley Associates * John Clark: Director of operations * Domingo \"Ding\" Chavez: Senior operations officer * Dominic \"Dom\" Caruso: Operations officer * Sam Driscoll: Operations officer * Jack Ryan, Jr.: Operations officer * Gavin Biery: Director of information technology * Adara Sherman: Director of logistics/transportation ===The North Koreans=== * Choi Ji-hoon: Dae Wonsu (grand marshal) and Supreme leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea * Ri Tae-jin: Lieutenant general in the Korean People's Army and director of the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), foreign intelligence arm of North Korea * Hwang Min-ho: Director of Korea Natural Resources Trading Corporation, North Korean state-owned mining arm ===Other characters=== * Wayne \"Duke\" Sharps: Former FBI agent, and president of Sharps Global Intelligence Partners * Edward Riley: Former MI6 station chief, and employee of Sharps Global Intelligence Partners * Veronika Martel (aka \u00c9lise Legrande): Former French intelligence officer, and employee of Sharps Global Intelligence Partners * Colin Hazelton: Former CIA case officer and employee of Sharps Global Intelligence Partners * Dr. Helen Powers: Australian geologist * \u00d3scar Roblas de Mota: Mexican billionaire and president of New World Metals LLC * Daryl Ricks: Chief (E-7), Naval Special Warfare, SEAL Team 5, Echo Platoon, NSW Group One * Marleni Allende: Chilean legal counsel of the United Nations Security Council Sanctions Committee * Santiago Maldonado: Leader of the Maldonado cartel * Emilio: Maldonado cartel member * Adel Zarif: Iranian bomb maker * Cathy Ryan: First Lady of the United States ==Reception== ===Commercial=== Full Force and Effect debuted at number three on the Combined Print & E-Book Fiction category of the New York Times bestseller list, as well as number five on the Hardcover Fiction category of the same list, for the week of December 21, 2014.
