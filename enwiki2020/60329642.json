    "text": "G 1/19 is a referral under pending before the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office (EPO) dealing with questions relating to the patentability of computer-implemented simulations. ==Background== The case, triggered by decision T 489/14 issued on 22 February 2019 by Board of Appeal 3.5.07, deals with a European patent application relating to \"a computer- implemented method, computer program and apparatus for simulating the movement of a pedestrian crowd through an environment\". Decision T 489/14 (Pedestrian simulation/CONNOR) of 22.2.2019, Reasons 2, first paragraph. \"The main purpose of the simulation is its use in a process for designing a venue such as a railway station or a stadium\".T 489/14, Reasons 2, third paragraph. While Board 3.5.07 acknowledged the analogy with case T 1227/05 (Circuit simulation I/Infineon Technologies)T 489/14, Reasons 14, first paragraph. (in which the specific mathematical steps involved in a computer-implemented simulation of an electrical circuit subject to noise were found to contribute to the technical character of the invention),Decision T 1227/05 (Circuit simulation I/Infineon Technologies) of 13.12.2006 which supported the applicant's case,T 489/14, Reasons 15, first paragraph. the Board did not agree with the conclusion reached by the deciding Board in T 1227/05. Eventually, considering this to be a question of fundamental importance, Board 3.5.07 decided to refer three questions to the Enlarged Board of Appeal. ==The questions== The three questions referred to the Enlarged Board of Appeal are: # \"In the assessment of inventive step, can the computer-implemented simulation of a technical system or process solve a technical problem by producing a technical effect which goes beyond the simulation's implementation on a computer, if the computer-implemented simulation is claimed as such? # If the answer to the first question is yes, what are the relevant criteria for assessing whether a computer-implemented simulation claimed as such solves a technical problem? In particular, is it a sufficient condition that the simulation is based, at least in part, on technical principles underlying the simulated system or process? # What are the answers to the first and second questions if the computer-implemented simulation is claimed as part of a design process, in particular for verifying a design?\" ==Amicus curiae and oral proceedings== Oral proceedings took place before the Enlarged Board of Appeal on July 15, 2020. The oral proceedings were live streamed over the internet. Additionally, third parties were given the opportunity to file written statements after the initial referral to the Enlarged Board of Appeal, to be considered as part of these oral proceedings, resulting in the filing of 23 amicus curiae briefs. ==See also== * G 3/08, referral relating to the patentability of programs for computers (referral held to be inadmissible for lack of divergent case law) * List of decisions and opinions of the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office ==References == ==Further reading== * * ==External links== *Decision T 489/14 (Pedestrian simulation/CONNOR) of 22.2.2019 G 2019 1 ",
