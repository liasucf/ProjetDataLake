    "text": "The thick-billed longspur or McCown's longspur (Rhynchophanes mccownii) is a small ground-feeding bird in the family Calcariidae, which also contains the other longspurs and snow buntings. It is found in North America and is the only species in the genus Rhynchophanes. ==Taxonomy== American amateur orntihologist George Newbold Lawrence described this species in 1851 as Calcarius mccownii. It was moved into its own genus Rhynchophanes in 1858 on account of its bill size and short spur, before being returned to Calcarius after a hybrid with the chestnut-collared longspur was discovered. It was once again placed in its own genus after a 2003 genetic study found it was more closely related to the snow buntings than the other longspurs. The name \"McCown\" refers to Captain John P. McCown, an American army officer who collected the specimen in 1851 that led to the species first being scientifically described. McCown later fought for the Confederacy, which led to controversy starting in 2018, with parallels drawn to the removal of Confederate memorials. The pressure to change the name increased following the George Floyd protests and Black Birder's Week (itself a response to the Central Park birdwatching incident). \"McCown's longspur\" is no longer used by the American Ornithological Society, instead being changed to \"thick-billed longspur\", a literal translation of its genus name, Rhynchophanes. The name change was announced after the most recent updates of the Clements and International Ornithological Congress taxonomies, which still use \"McCown's longspur\". The IOC has indicated that they will most likely follow suit with the name change. ==Description== Thick-billed longspurs are about 15 cm long and weigh around 25 g with a wingspan of 28 cm. They have a large cone-shaped bill, a streaked back, a rust-coloured shoulder and a white tail with a dark tip. In breeding plumage, the male has a white throat and underparts, a grey face and nape and a black crown. Other plumages are very plain brown overall with pink bills. ==Distribution== Thick-billed longspurs nest in shortgrass prairies in the northwestern Great Plains states and southern Prairie Provinces. They winter primarily in Texas and northern Mexico. There are accidental sightings elsewhere in North America. ==Behaviour== The male produces a distinctive tinkling song, often in flight. The calls include a dry rattle. Nests are constructed in a shallow depression on the ground, and incubate the eggs for about 12 days. Both parents feed the young, and fledglings leave the nest about 10 days after hatching, before they can properly fly. Outside the breeding season, thick-billed longspurs occur in flocks, sometimes with other species like Lapland longspur and horned lark. The diet consists of seeds and insects. ==Conservation== The numbers and range of these birds have declined since the early 1900s, likely due to habitat loss. ==References== ==Further reading== ===Book=== * With, K.
