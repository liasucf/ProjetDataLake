    "text": "\u017bubr beer (Polish for Bison) is a Polish lager brewed by the Kompania Piwowarska SA. It was formerly known as Dojlidy, the name of the brewery in the Bia\u0142ystok district of Dojlidy, where it is produced. ==Brand== \u017bubr has been brewed since the Dojlidy Brewery opened in 1768. The Bia\u0142ystok based brewery was bought by the SABMiller subsidiary Kompania Piwowarska SA in 2003. The brew contains 12.1% (by weight) of extract content and 6.0% alcohol. Currently it is brewed at three Kompania Piwowarska breweries: Bia\u0142ystok, Poznan and Tychy. ==Marketing== It is available throughout Poland, and is also available in many off-licences in the UK, due to demand for the beer from the Polish population in Britain. It is currently the second most popular in beer in Poland, with 14% market control. It is rare in the United States, although it has recently started to be sold around the Chicago area by various retailers. The cans and bottles use a distinctive green packaging. The logo prominently features a \u017bubr, or European Bison. ==Pra\u017cubr, Bizon and Prabizon== In April 2016, Kompania Piwowarska launched another special beer on the market. Pra\u017cubr is an unpasteurized lager with moderate bitterness and an alcohol content of 5% vol. It is available in returnable bottles and in 500 ml cans. His recipe was developed at the Dojlidy Bia\u0142ystok brewery. The product's name refers to the steppe bison - a mammal from the Pleistocene period, related to today's European bison. Advertising spots also emphasize the similarity between these species. The product page is http://www.prazubr.pl/.

Rafal Rodziewicz answered, that 2022 will be \"Bizon\", but in 2030 (possibly early 2030) they will brew a \"Prabizon\". ==See also== *Polish beer *Kompania Piwowarska ==References== Category:Beer in Poland Category:Beer brands of Poland ",
