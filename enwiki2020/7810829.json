He is the former head coach of both the Canada national rugby league team and the England Knights/Elite Development Squad. ==Background== Purtill was born in Wigan, Greater Manchester, England. ==Career== A former scrum half for the Wigan warriors, Huddersfield Giants and Leigh Centurions, Purtill was forced to retire from playing due to injury and moved into coaching. He started as a coach at St. Helens before joining Huddersfield Giants as an assistant coach in 2005. At Huddersfield, he worked under head coach Jon Sharp, who rated him as one of the best young coaches in the game. Following Sharp's departure from the club in 2008, Purtill had a brief spell as caretaker coach alongside Paul Anderson. He then moved to St Helens where he worked under Michael Potter and then Royce Simmons. He also became head coach of the Canada Wolverines rugby league team and in 2011 the England Knights team. He also did a PG Dip in Elite Coaching Practice at the University of Central Lancashire. He parted company with St Helens along with Royce Simmons on 18 March 2012 following a run of 5 games without a win. He has since been linked with a return to Huddersfield or to Bradford Bulls, both in assistant roles. == References == ==External links== *Leigh Centurions profile Category:English rugby league coaches Category:English rugby league players Category:Huddersfield Giants players Category:Leigh Centurions players Category:Living people Category:1977 births Category:Rugby league centres Category:Rugby league halfbacks ",
