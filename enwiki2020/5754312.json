This township was once home to many Western expatriates circa 1970s. It is located roughly halfway between Ampang and Melawati. Sri Ukay is a residential area located immediately adjacent to Hillview. Due to its proximity to the nearest hills, a collection of houses and apartments were built here. Many major landslides occurred due to the soil erosion that occurs after heavy rain. This taman also recently added a guard house. This security system included motorcycle rounding. This is a gated community. ==Notable events== *11 December 1993 - Block 1 of the Highland Towers collapse, 48 people killed. *20 November 2002 - The bungalow of the Affin Bank chairman General (RtD) Tan Sri Ismail Omar collapsed caused by a landslide in Taman Hillview. ==See also== * Bukit Antarabangsa Category:Townships in Selangor ",
