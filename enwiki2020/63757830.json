    "text": "The Double-A All-Star Game was an annual baseball game sanctioned by Minor League Baseball between professional players from the three Double-A leagues\u2014the Eastern League (EL), Southern League (SL), and Texas League (TL)\u2014contested from 1991 to 2002. Teams of American League-affiliated Double-A All-Stars faced off against teams of National League-affiliated Double-A All- Stars. == History == The three Double-A leagues\u2014the Eastern League (EL), Southern League (SL), and Texas League (TL)\u2014were inspired by the success of the Triple-A All-Star Game to combine for their own meeting of their classification's All-Stars. The first Double-A All-Star game was played in 1991 at Joe W. Davis Stadium in Huntsville, Alabama. Players were divided into teams of American League affiliates and National League affiliates as voted on by members of the local media in each of the classification's 26 cities. In later years, teams were selected by the three league presidents. Despite the game's initial commercial success, the travel logistics involving teams stretching from El Paso, Texas, to Altoona, Pennsylvania, made organizing the game difficult. The creation of the All-Star Futures Game in 1999 drew away both publicity and players. The final Double-A All-Star Game was played in 2002 at Senator Thomas J. Dodd Memorial Stadium in Norwich, Connecticut. == Results == {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:left;\" |- !Date !Winning team (All-time record) !Score !City !Ballpark !Host team (league) !Attendance !class=unsortable| |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"| |bgcolor=#ffcccc|American |align=center| |Huntsville, Alabama |Joe W.

Michael Cuddyer, the 2001 Eastern League MVP, was voted onto two MLB All-Star teams. Through 1996, a Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award was given to the player with the best performance from each Double-A league. Only one award was planned for the overall Most Valuable Player in 1997, but two players were selected as co- MVPs. Single MVPs were also selected in 1998 and 2000. In the final two years of contention, 2001 and 2002, the classification reverted to the original format and selected three MVPs, one from each league. Three players each from the El Paso Diablos and Huntsville Stars were selected for MVP Awards, more than any other teams. The Harrisburg Senators, Knoxville/Tennessee Smokies, Memphis Chicks, Midland Angels/RockHounds, New Britain Red Sox/Rock Cats, and Orlando SunRays/Cubs each had two MVPs. {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Year !width=\"210px\"|EL MVP !width=\"210px\"|SL MVP !width=\"210px\"|TL MVP !class=unsortable| |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|1991 |align=left| |align=left| |align=left| | |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|1992 |align=left| |align=left| |align=left| | |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|1993 |align=left| |align=left| |align=left| | |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|1994 |align=left| |align=left| |align=left| | |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|1995 |align=left| |align=left| |align=left| | |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|1996 |align=left| |align=left| |align=left| | |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|1997 |align=left| |align=left| |align=center|\u2014 | |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|1998 |align=left| |align=center|\u2014 |align=center|\u2014 | |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text- align:center\"|1999 |align=center|\u2014 |align=center|\u2014 |align=center|\u2014 | |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|2000 |align=center|\u2014 |align=left| |align=center|\u2014 | |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|2001 |align=left| |align=left| |align=left| | |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|2002 |align=left| |align=left| |align=left| | |} ==Notes== == References == Category:Eastern League (baseball) Category:Southern League (baseball) Category:Texas League Category:All-star games Category:Minor league baseball playoffs and champions Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1991 Category:Recurring sporting events established in 2002 ",
