Martineau came to Ottawa some time before 1860. A stone building on Murray Street in the Byward Market area now known as Heritage House, previously known as the Martineau Hotel, was built by Martineau in 1872. He served at least 16 years as alderman on the City Council. Martineau promoted the building of an aqueduct across the Lebreton Flats to provide water to the city. Late in life, he encountered financial problems in his business interests and died in 1880. ==References== Category:Mayors of Ottawa Category:Franco-Ontarian people Category:1837 births Category:1880 deaths ",
