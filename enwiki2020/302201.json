    "text": "Midtown Manhattan is the central portion of the New York City borough of Manhattan. Midtown is home to some of the city's most prominent buildings, including the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project, the headquarters of the United Nations, Grand Central Terminal, and Rockefeller Center, as well as tourist destinations such as Broadway and Times Square. Midtown Manhattan is the largest central business district in the world and ranks among the most expensive pieces of real estate; Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan commands the world's highest retail rents, with average annual rents at US in 2017. However, due to the high price of retail spaces in Midtown, there are also many vacant storefronts in the neighborhood. Midtown is the country's largest commercial, entertainment, and media center, and also a growing financial center. The majority of New York City's skyscrapers, including its tallest hotels and apartment towers, are in Midtown. The area hosts commuters and residents working in its offices, hotels, and retail establishments, tourists and students. Times Square, the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District, is a major center of the world's entertainment industry. Sixth Avenue also has the headquarters of three of the four major U.S. television networks. Midtown is part of Manhattan Community District 5. It is patrolled by the 14th and 18th Precincts of the New York City Police Department. ==Location== Midtown Manhattan in January 2020 Geographically, the northern boundary of Midtown Manhattan is commonly defined to be 59th Street; its southern boundary is less clear, and variously taken to be 34th Street, 23rd Street, or even 14th Street. Midtown spans the entire island of Manhattan along an east\u2013west axis, bounded by the East River on its east and the Hudson River to its west. The Encyclopedia of New York City defines Midtown as extending from 34th Street to 59th Street and from 3rd Avenue to 8th Avenue.Sclar, Elliot. \"midtown\" in , p. 839 ===Neighborhoods=== Madison Square Garden Times Square (2013), one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections 32nd Street in Manhattan's Koreatown (\ub9e8\ud574\ud2bc \ucf54\ub9ac\uc544\ud0c0\uc6b4) The United Nations Secretariat Building at the United Nations Headquarters Herald Square, with Macy's In addition to its central business district, Midtown Manhattan encompasses many neighborhoods, including Hell's Kitchen and Chelsea on the West Side, and Murray Hill, Kips Bay, Turtle Bay, and Gramercy Park on the East Side.

Community District 5 is largely coterminous with Midtown but also includes the Flatiron District, NoMad, Union Square, and parts of Gramercy Park and Rose Hill. * Midtown proper (within the boundaries of Manhattan Community District 5, and excluding overlapping neighborhoods) is located from 34th to 59th Streets between Third Avenue and Eighth Avenue. * The \"Plaza District\", a term used by Manhattan real estate professionals to denote the most expensive area of midtown from a commercial real estate perspective, lies between 42nd Street and 59th Street, from 3rd Avenue to 7th Avenue, about a square kilometer or half a square mile. * \"Midtown South\" can refer to the part of Midtown between 23rd Street and around 42nd Street (although its northern boundary is defined differently depending on the source). * \"Midtown West\" can refer to the area between 34th and 59th Streets, and between 5th and 12th Avenues. * \"Midtown East\" can refer to the area between 42nd and 59th Streets, and between 5th Avenue and the East River. * In 1982, the City of New York identified the \"Manhattan Core\" as the area that includes some of the city's most populous neighborhoods, major institutions, parks and transit hubs, and the city's primary Central Business District (CBD), defined as Manhattan below 60th Street. The \"Manhattan Core\" includes some areas slightly further north of 86th Street in Manhattan, as well as the area below 14th Street; however, this definition is problematic because it ignores the fact that Manhattan has not one but two zones in which people do business within this area separated by a wide swath of low-rise (by New York City standards) residential development \u2014 there is Midtown (which is in Midtown Manhattan), and the Financial District, (also known simply as \"Downtown\" because of its location in southern Manhattan). In other sources, these districts are referred to as separate central business districts. ===Cityscape=== The skyline of Midtown Manhattan, looking Downtown (south) toward Lower Manhattan, in April 2017 ==Economy== Midtown Manhattan, along with Lower Manhattan, is one of the world's leading financial centers. ===Corporate headquarters=== Midtown Manhattan is the world's largest central business district, with 400 million square feet (37.2 million m2) of office space in 2018.
