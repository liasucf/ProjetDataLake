For his miserable excuse forever is a long way since the new one was a musical farce, which arrived yesterday at the Paramount, comes perilously close to being the most haphazard, pointless and dull motion picture shown on Broadway this season. Those are grim words, we'll admit, but so too is You're the One grim. And, to spare the distressing details, we will simply say that it tells the vapid tale of a little singer, Bonnie Baker, who pursues a big band leader to a crazy health resort in quest of a job as vocalist and of the silly things which happen there.\" == References == == External links == * Category:1941 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:American comedy films Category:1941 comedy films Category:Films directed by Ralph Murphy Category:American black- and-white films ",
