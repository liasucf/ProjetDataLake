    "text": "The lek (; plural lek\u00eb) (sign: L; code: ALL) is the official currency of Albania. It was formerly subdivided into 100 qindarka (singular qindark\u00eb), but qindarka are no longer issued. ==History== Alexander the Great on the first Albanian 1 leke coin. The lek was introduced as the first Albanian currency in February 1926.Bank of Albania. Available at: Before then, Albania was a country without a currency, adhering to a gold standard for the fixation of commercial values. Before the First World War the Ottoman Turkish piastre was in full circulation, but following the military occupation of the country by various continental powers the gold franc (Franc Germinal) was adopted as the monetary unit. In 1923 Italian paper circulated at Shkod\u00ebr, Durr\u00ebs, Vlor\u00eb, and Gjirokast\u00ebr, and the Greek drachma at Kor\u00e7\u00eb, the values of which varied according to locality and the prevailing rates of exchange as compared with gold.Trade Information Bulletin, Numbers 79 to 118, 1923 ===Etymology=== The leke was named after Alexander the Great, whose name is often shortened to Leka in Albanian. Alexander's portrait appeared on the obverse of the 1 lek coin, while the reverse showed him on his horse. The name qindark\u00eb comes from the Albanian qind, meaning one hundred. The word is thus similar in formation to centime, cent, etc. ===Franga=== Between 1926 and 1939 the name Franga was used for Albanian gold currency worth five Albanian Lek\u00eb for use in international transactions. A similar alternate name Belga was used for units of five Belgian francs. ==Coins== ===First lek=== In 1926, bronze coins were introduced in denominations of 5 and 10 qindar leku, together with nickel , and 1 lek, and silver 1, 2 and 5 franga ar. The obverse of the franga coins depicts Amet Zogu. In 1935, bronze 1 and 2 qindar ar were issued, equal in value to the 5 and 10 qindar leku respectively. This coin series depicted distinct neoclassical motifs, said to have been influenced by the Italian king Victor Emmanuel III who was known to have been a coin collector. These coins depict the mint marks \"R\", \"V\" or \"L\", indicating Rome, Vienna or London. Under the direction of Benito Mussolini, Italy invaded and occupied Albania and issued a new series of coins in 1939 in denominations 0.20, 0.50, 1 and 2 lek in stainless steel, and silver 5, and 10 lek were introduced, with the silver coins only issued that year. Aluminium-bronze 0.05 and 0.10 lek were introduced in 1940. A fixed exchange with the Italian lira at 1:6.25 was established. These coins were issued until 1941 and bear the portrait of Italian King Victor Emmanuel III on the obverse and the Albanian eagle with fasces on the reverse. In 1947, shortly after the Communist Party took power, older coins were withdrawn from circulation and a new coinage was introduced, consisting of zinc , 1, 2 and 5 lek\u00eb. These all depicted the socialist national crest. This coinage was again minted in 1957 and used until the currency reform of 1965. ===Second lek=== In 1965, the old lek banknotes and coins were exchanged into new ones, 10:1 (the amount allowed for exchange was limited). Aluminium coins (dated 1964) were introduced in denominations of 5, 10, 20 and 50 qindar and 1 lek. All coins show the socialist state emblem. In 1969, a second series of aluminium 5, 10, 20, 50 qindar and 1 lek coins was released commemorating the 1944 liberation from fascism. The three smallest denominations remained similar in design to the 1964 series but depicted \"1944-1969\" on the obverse. The 50 qindarka and lek coins showed patriotic and military images. In 1988, a third redesign of aluminium 5, 10, 20, 50 qindarka and 1 lek coins was released. The 50 qindarka and 1 lek coins were problematically identical in size, weight, and appearance, so aluminium-bronze 1 lek coins with the inscription \"Republika Popullore Socialiste e Shqip\u00ebris\u00eb\" were released later that year for better identification. In 1989, a cupro- nickel 2 lek\u00eb coin was introduced. All three of these coin series remained in circulation during and shortly after the 1991 revolution. ===Third lek=== In 1995 and 1996, new coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 lek\u00eb, with a bimetallic 100 lek\u00eb added in 2000. The 1 lek coin is not practically in use. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\" !colspan=\"9\"|Coins of the lek (1995\u2013present)https://www.bankofalbania.org/Currency/Coins_in_circulation/ |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Obverse !!rowspan=\"2\"| Reverse !!rowspan=\"2\" | Value !!colspan=\"3\"| Technical parameters !!colspan=\"3\"| Description |- !
