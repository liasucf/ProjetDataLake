    "text": "Dressbarn.com (branded as Dressbarn) is an online retailer owned by Retail Ecommerce Ventures that was linked to a former chain of women's clothing stores owned by Ascena that operated from 1962 until 2019. The first Dressbarn opened in February 1962 in Stamford, Connecticut, by Roslyn Jaffe. Jaffe saw the opportunity to provide wear-to-work dresses and clothing for the working woman during a time when women were entering the workforce in greater numbers. The company began trading on NASDAQ (symbol DBRN) in 1982. In January 2011, to reflect its broader holdings, the company was reorganized as a Delaware corporation named Ascena Retail Group, Inc. The company's NASDAQ symbol also changed to ASNA in 2011. On May 21, 2019, Ascena Retail Group announced that all 650 DressBarn Stores would be closing, which they did on December 26. Eventually, Dressbarn brand was sold by Ascena to Tai Lopez and his business partner, Alex Mehr (via newly established Retail Ecommerce Ventures), and the site was relaunched in 2020. == References == Category:Clothing retailers of the United States Category:American companies established in 1962 Category:Retail companies established in 1962 Category:Retail companies disestablished in 2019 Category:1962 establishments in New Jersey Category:1962 establishments in Connecticut Category:Companies based in Bergen County, New Jersey Category:Retail companies based in New Jersey Category:Mahwah, New Jersey Category:Online retailers of the United States Category:American companies established in 2020 Category:Retail companies established in 2020 Category:Internet properties established in 2020 Category:Ascena Retail Group ",
