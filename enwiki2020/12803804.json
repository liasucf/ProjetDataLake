    "text": "\"Sweet Lorraine\" is a popular song by Cliff Burwell (music) and Mitchell Parish (lyrics) that was published in 1928 and has become a jazz standard. It was written in F major and has an AABA structure. A version by Teddy Wilson charted briefly in 1935. The song probably kept its place in public awareness because of recordings by Nat King Cole. ==References== ==See also== *List of 1920s jazz standards *Maureen Stapleton#Filmography (film Sweet Lorraine) Category:1928 songs Category:1920s jazz standards Category:Songs with lyrics by Mitchell Parish Category:Nat King Cole songs Category:Jazz compositions in F major Category:Bluebird Records singles Category:United States National Recording Registry recordings ",
