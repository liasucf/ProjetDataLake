    "text": "Shotton Hall is a Grade II listed building, formerly a mansion house, now operated by Peterlee Town Council as offices and a conference centre. The Manor of Shotton, near Peterlee, County Durham, was owned by the Thompson family. In 1756 the Thompson heiress, Elizabeth, married Charles Brandling and they commissioned the building of a new mansion to replace the existing manor house. The Hall was enlarged and improved in about 1820 but the Shotton estate was sold by the Brandlings in 1850 to Shotton Coal Company. The Hall was occupied by the Burdon family and later by a series of tenants. It fell into a state of neglect and disrepair. In 1949 the Hall was occupied by the Peterlee Development Corporation and in 1984 was acquired by the Peterlee Town Council who restored the property for their own occupation. ==References== * English Heritage, architectural description of listed building Category:Grade II listed buildings in County Durham Category:History of County Durham Category:Country houses in County Durham Category:Peterlee ",
