    "text": "The Azores Geopark () is a network of 121 geographically-dispersed sites of geographic heritage and marine areas that covers the nine volcanic islands of the archipelago of the Azores. This network is managed by the Azores Geopark Association, a non-profit association, with its headquarters in Horta on the island of Faial, established 19 May 2010. It is part of the European Geoparks Network and the UNESCO Global Geoparks Network. The Association's mission is to ensure the geological conservation, environmental education and sustainable development, while promoting the well-being of the population and a respect for the environment. ==Geopark== The term is used to define a well-defined territory and boundary, whose existence is based on an exceptional geological heritage and a strategy that promotes the well-being of the population while maintaining a respect for the environment. Consequently, the Geopark includes a number of significant sites of geological interest, based on their unique or rare characteristics or which have a scientific, cultural, economic (tourist), scenic or aesthetic relevance. Similarly, if its ecology, history or cultural value, along with its thematic or comparable infrastructures can be interconnected in a network, by trails or routes. Due to its nature, the geopark concept is based on several objectives: * Conservation and preservation of geosites of particular importance, exploring and developing methods for geo-conservation, in order to protect the geological patrimony for future generations; * Environmental education to promote public consciousness of the important geological heritage and its contribution to the surrounding environment; and to support scientific research and dissemination, as well as encouraging a dialogue between geoscientists and local communities; * Stimulate economic activity and sustainable development, through the promotion of nature and rural tourism (Geotourism) for the socio-economic development of the local populations; and to develop an appreciation for the natural and cultural heritage, towards revitalizing traditional activities and products of excellence and quality. == Geography == Situated west of continental Portugal, about northwest of Madeira and approximately southeast of Newfoundland and Labrador, the Azores Geopark includes several geologically-significant sites throughout all nine islands and maritime seafloor of the Azores. There are 121 geosites in the nine islands, most of them with international or national relevance. The Geopark extends across an area of , including of marine territory. Among these geosites, 57 were considered priority locations for the application of geoconservation strategies or for appreciation programs. The archipelago of the Azores includes a rich and vast geodiversity, and an important geological heritage, comprising various locales of interest to the scientific and learning communities, in addition to its socio-economic importance to tourism. Due to it being an archipelago, the Azores Geopark is disperse: guaranteeing a representative geodiversity that characterizes the Azorean territory; manifesting in a history based on geological and active volcanism; with conservation strategies that are common; and based on a decentralized management structure with supports in all islands. Characteristic of the Azorean geological history is a range of diverse features that includes (but is not limited to) volcanoes, calderas, lakes, lava fields, fumaroles, hot springs and thermal waters, volcanic caves, faj\u00e3s, fault scarps and marine fossil deposits. Beyond this heritage, there are other values of reference in the archipelago, such as its rich biodiversity, architecture, culture and ethnography. ===Corvo=== * COR 1 Caldeir\u00e3o * COR 2 Lava faj\u00e3 of Vila do Corvo * COR 3 Ponta do Marco ===Flores=== * FLO 1 Caldeira Negra, Caldeira Comprida, Caldeira Seca and Caldeira Branca * FLO 2 Caldeira Funda and Caldeira Rasa * FLO 3 Faj\u00e3 Grande and Faj\u00e3zinha * FLO 4 Pico da S\u00e9 * FLO 5 Ponta da Rocha Alta and Faj\u00e3 de Lopo Vaz * FLO 6 Rocha dos Bord\u00f5es ===Faial=== * FAI 1 Caldera * FAI 2 Pedro Miguel Graben * FAI 3 Monte da Guia * FAI 4 Morro do Castelo Branco * FAI 5 Capelo Peninsula * FAI 6 Capelinhos e Costado da Nau ===Pico=== * PIC 1 Fossil arriba of Santo Ant\u00f3nio * PIC 2 Lava faj\u00e3 of Lajes do Pico * PIC 3 Gruta das Torres * PIC 4 Madalena Islets * PIC 5 Lajido de Santa Luzia * PIC 6 Mount Pico * PIC 7 Achada Plateau * PIC 8 Ponta da Ilha ===S\u00e3o Jorge=== * SJO 1 Arribas of Faj\u00e3 dos Vimes and Faj\u00e3 de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o * SJO 2 Central volcanic * SJO 3 Faj\u00e3 do Ouvidor and Faj\u00e3 da Ribeira da Areia * SJO 4 Faj\u00e3s dos Cubres and Faj\u00e3 da Caldeira do Santo Cristo * SJO 5 Morro de Velas and Morro de Lemos ===Graciosa=== * GRA 1 Caldera and Furna do Enxofre * GRA 2 Caldera P\u00earo Botelho * GRA 3 Ponta da Barca and Baleia Islet * GRA 4 Porto Afonso * GRA 5 Ponta do Carapacho, Ponta da Restinga and Baixo Islet ===Terceira=== * TER 1 Algar do Carv\u00e3o * TER 3 Guilherme Moniz Caldera * TER 2 Santa B\u00e1rbara Caldera and Mist\u00e9rios Negros * TER 4 Furnas do Enxofre * TER 5 Monte Brasil * TER 6 Pico Alto, Biscoito Rachado and Biscoito da Ferraria * TER 7 Ponta da Serreta and Trachyte lava flows ===S\u00e3o Miguel=== * SMG 1 Furnas Caldera * SMG 2 Sete Cidades Caldera * SMG 3 Fogo Caldera * SMG 4 Caldeira Velha * SMG 5 Gruta do Carv\u00e3o * SMG 6 Vila Franca Islet * SMG 7 Lagoas do Congro and Lagoa dos Nen\u00fafares * SMG 8 Ponta da Ferraria and Pico das Camarinhas * SMG 9 Serra Devassa * SMG 10 Vale da Ribeira do Faial da Terra and Faj\u00e3 do Calhau ===Santa Maria=== * SMA 1 Barreiro da Faneca * SMA 2 Pedreira do Campo * SMA 3 Po\u00e7o da Pedreira * SMA 4 Ponta do Castelo * SMA 5 Ribeira do Malo\u00e1s ===EEZ=== * MAR 1 Dom Jo\u00e3o de Castro Bank * MAR 2 Mid-Atlantic Ridge and hydrothermal vents == Environmental awareness == The Geopark implemented various routes and trails on every island to discover the volcanic landscapes.
