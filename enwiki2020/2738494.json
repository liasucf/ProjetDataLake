    "text": "Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez (Spanish for \"Hurricane Ramirez\") is a fictitious character, originally invented for the 1952 Mexican Lucha film of the same name. After the movie opened in theaters Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez also became a professional wrestling character in the ring, primarily played by luchador Eduardo Bonada, who was soon after replaced in the mid-1950s by wrestler Daniel Garc\u00eda Arteaga who wrestled under that name for more than thirty years. The rights to the name and image of Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez were never owned by Garc\u00eda, which has led to a number of other wrestlers using the name \"Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez\" after Garcia retired in 1988, or variations on the theme such as Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez II, Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez Jr., el Hijo de Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez (\"Son of Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez\") and so on, but all of whom had no atual family relationship to Daniel Garc\u00eda. ==Movie Character== Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez was originally just the title character of a 1952 Mexican film called \"Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez\" that starred actor David Silva as a masked professional wrestler or luchador enmascarado character he names Huracan Ramirez. In the film, a young Mexican, whose father is an aging professional wrestler, decides to follow in his father's footsteps by adopting the secret identity of \"Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez\", a masked luchador, and he fights in the ring in spite of his father's wishes to the contrary. While David Silva played the part of Huracan's unmasked alter ego Fernando Torres, the wrestling sequences were performed by an actual luchador named Eduardo Bonada, who then went on for a few years to play the role in real life, in the ring. In the mid-1950s, Bonada tired of the role, preferring not to cover his face with a mask, and quit the gig, at which time he was replaced by the film's producers with another wrestler named David Garcia Arteaga, who played the role in the ring for about 30 years, until he retired in 1988. The Huracan Ramirez name came from combining a natural disaster with a strong Spanish last name to appeal to the Mexican crowd. Initially he was named \"Hurac\u00e1n L\u00f3pez\", but it was later changed to Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez to avoid confusion with Tarz\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, one of the top Mexican Luchadors at the time. A sequel, El misterio de Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez (\"The Mystery of Hurricane Ramirez\") came out in 1962 and again featured leading man David Silva reprising his role, but the wrestling sequences this time were all played by the new Huracan, Daniel Garc\u00eda, who had played the character in the ring ever since Eduardo Bonada had quit the gig. David Silva played the unmasked Huracan in the first 4 films, to be replaced by actor Pepe Romay in the last few films. Bonada's and Garcia's faces were never shown in any of the films they appeared in, as they only played the masked scenes in the films. The Hurac\u00e1n character is the property of filmmaker Juan Rodr\u00edguez Mas and his father, Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez (the director of the first Hurac\u00e1n film), who allowed first Eduardo Bonada, and later Daniel Garc\u00eda, to play the character in the ring up until each man retired. In 1989, following Garc\u00eda's retirement from the ring, Rodr\u00edguez wanted to give the mask and character to a new younger wrestler, tying the transfer in with a new Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez movie he was promoting. Garc\u00eda resented the idea that someone else would cash in on the popularity he gained while wrestling. In 1988, after the producers refused to share the profits from a then-flourishing Huracan comic book with Garcia, Garcia spitefully unmasked on television and at several fan events, messing up Rodr\u00edguez Mas' plans and the character in general. The Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez film, Huracan Ramirez vs the Terrorists, was released in 1989 but did not do well. ===Filmography=== A total of 9 \"Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez\" movies were made in all, the 7th, 8th and 9th films being more or less unrelated. Unlike the Santo movies, these films tended to focus more on dramatic subplots and musical numbers, and never really gave the Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez character a lot to do in the films from an action standpoint. Eduardo Bonada played Huracan in the first movie only, then David Garc\u00eda Arteaga played the part of Huracan in the next five movies (from 1962-1974), his last real appearance being De Sangre Chicana (1974), although he continued to wrestle as Huracan in the ring until 1988. Garcia said that he did not wear the mask for the 2 later \"Torito\" movies (in 1979 and 1982 respectively), films featuring a wrestler called Torito which only featured very brief scenes of Huracan, nor did he appear in the 1989 movie. *Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez (Hurricane Ramirez) (1952) starring Eduardo Bonada in the masked action scenes *El misterio de Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez (\"The Mystery of Hurricane Ramirez\") (1962) David Garcia's first turn at playing the masked action scenes *El Hijo de Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez (\"The Son of Hurricane Ramirez\") (1966) w.

The person playing Huracan Jr. was not related to any of the wrestlers who played Huracan Ramirez in the original movies. ==Wrestling character== The original \"Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez\", Eduardo Bonada, adopted the mask and ring name as an actual professional wrestler after he played the masked wrestling scenes in the original 1952 film, with the approval of the film's director Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez, who agreed that a \"real life Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez\" would be a good way to ensure the success of his movie. Bonada did not enjoy wrestling under a mask, as it hid his good looks and prevented his recognizability. At one point he spitefully unmasked in public and revealed that he had been playing \"Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez\" in the ring but was now moving on to other projects. After Bonada gave up the character in the mid-50s, a number of wrestlers started wrestling as \"Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez\" all over Mexico, but the local boxing and wrestling commissions who regulate professional wrestling in Mexico objected to the deception. The movie's producers held a tryout to see who would be the \"one true\" Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez in the wrestling world. They chose Daniel Garc\u00eda to play the part, but never publicly revealed who had taken over the mask both in their ensuing films as well as in the ring. Later in the year Garcia made his official Mexico City debut in a match against El Medico Asesino. Taking over the gig from Bonada, Garc\u00eda wrestled as \"Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez\" for more than thirty years, becoming one of the most popular wrestlers in Mexico as well as in other Spanish-speaking countries such as Bolivia and Ecuador. In the mid-1980s, Garc\u00eda wanted to ensure that the \"Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez\" character was passed on to another generation, much in the same tradition of Santo passing his name on to El Hijo del Santo and Blue Demon's legacy being continued by Blue Demon, Jr.. This desire, and issues over sharing the profits from the \"Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez\" comic book and merchandising led to a falling out between Garc\u00eda and Rodr\u00edguez Mas, which led to Mas threatening to take the \"Ram\u00edrez\" character away from Garc\u00eda altogether. Following the threat, Garc\u00eda voluntarily unmasked on national television, ensuring that everyone knew who the true \"Hurac\u00e1n\" had been for the past 30 years. The move did prevent any subsequent wrestlers working as \"Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez\" from gaining anywhere near Garcia's popularity. In subsequent years, several wrestlers have however used similar ring names such as Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez II, Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez, Jr., el Hijo de Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez and variations thereof, (or names inspired by Ram\u00edrez such as \"Cicl\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez\"). ==Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez in pop culture== The \"Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez\" character has been used or included in a number of different non-Lucha Libre contexts. Replicas of his mask has been for sale through a number venues, including such non- wrestling venues as Amazon.com and Halloween stores. The distinctive blue and white mask has also been included as an option in the Create a Wrestler (CAW) option of a number of pro wrestling video games such as WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009. ==References== ==External links== *Santo and Friends Category:Professional wrestling gimmicks es:Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez ja:\u30a6\u30e9\u30ab\u30f3\u30fb\u30e9\u30df\u30ec\u30b9 ",
