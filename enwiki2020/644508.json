It was founded from the Society for the Studies of Soviet Culture to teach about Russian culture to Germans unfamiliar with it. It quickly turned into a propaganda tool and eventually changed its name. Due to the immense popularity of Mikhail Gorbachev with ordinary East Germans disillusioned with their own hardline Communist leaders, the DSF's membership grew massively in the last years of the regime which many interpret as a sign of support of Gorbachev's glasnost and perestroika by the East German people. In 1989 there were 6.3 million members.Dirk Jurich, Staatssozialismus und gesellschaftliche Differenzierung: eine empirische Studie, p.32. LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster, 2006, Following the disbanding of the German Democratic Republic, the organization was dissolved. The name of the German band Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft, which means German-American Friendship, is a play on the name of the DSF. ==Notes== == Literature == * Matthias Klingenberg: \"Culture as vehicle : the history of the German-Soviet Friendship-Society (1947-1953)\", Heidelberg 2001.
