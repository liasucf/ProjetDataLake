Franz Xaver Setzer self portrait ==Biography== He received his training at the Imperial Royal Institute of Prints and Drawings, he later founded his own studio in 1909. Setzer saw his portraits as works of art and the style of portraiture against unvarnished background he used was considered very modern at that time. The news that the portraits created in Setzer's studio were of the highest artistic quality had quickly spread in Vienna during the interwar years. The well-lit studio in the attic of the Museumstrasse 5 in the 7th district in Vienna was one of the first addresses for portraits.T. Starl: Setzer, Franz Xav .; eigentl.
