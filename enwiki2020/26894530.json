They wore red neckerchiefs for identification. The name Maragato (originally pejorative, then embraced by the rebels themselves) came from the fact that their leaders had been in exile in a region of Uruguay heavily populated by emigrants from La Maragater\u00eda in Spain.John Charles Chasteen, Heroes on Horseback: A Life and Times of the Last Gaucho Caudillos (UNM Press, 1995: ), p. 11. ==References== Category:Protests in Brazil Category:Brazilian rebels ",
