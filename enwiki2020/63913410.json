Yet in each case what that exquisite structure contains, in its very concreteness, is a mystery. Kubrick controlled every last dimension of his movies. Except what they meant\". Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"As a look at Kubrick's methods, madness and burning intelligence, Kubrick by Kubrick is fluent and discerning\". Eric Kohn of IndieWire said \"Kubrick by Kubrick lingers in the restless ingenuity at the heart of the filmmaker's work \u2013 a palpable desire to find new storytelling possibilities each time out\". == References == == External links == * Category:2020 television films Category:2020 films Category:French television films Category:2020 documentary films Category:French films Category:French documentary films ",
