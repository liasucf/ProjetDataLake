    "text": "The Fruita Museum, at 432 E. Aspen in Fruita, Colorado, is a Rustic-style building which was built in 1938-39 as a Works Progress Administration project to serve as a museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. In 2018, the building serves as home of the Fruita Area Chamber of Commerce and as a visitor center. ==Description== It is a one-story small building, with main room approximately in plan, and with a wing at its southwest corner. It was built slowly: > In an April, 1996 interview, Paul Peacock, a member of the crew that worked > on the building, recalled the arrival of \"rocks from south of the river and > the Utah desert west of Fruita.\" Some people donated \"favorite rocks that > they had gathered up from trips.\" Peacock described some work days as > including nothing but hunting for and hauling materials to the site. Some of > the larger rocks had to be held in place until the cement started to set. > The work was often slow and tedious, resulting in the nickname of the \"Rock- > a-Day Building.\" It was used by the Fruita Times starting in 1945. It served as the Fruita Library from 1948 to 1996, becoming a branch of the Mesa County Library in 1952.
