Those with an English background know the term to be defined as \"empowering those who have no rights \". In April of 1909, pamplets were published in efforts to oppose votes for women. These pamplets were created by group of men who paid one to five cents to become a member of the organization. The league gathered as many signatures as possible and published them throughout the 1900's. The organization was orginally called the Women's National Anti- Suffrage League but after running out of funding they were bought out by the Men's League for Opposing Women's Suffrage. The uniting of two groups created the new name, National League for Opposing Women's Suffrage.

Victoria did not admit women to the voting polls until 1909. Local residents responded to the formation of the Anti-Franchise League by establishing the Harcourt Branch of the Women's Franchise League - the Castlemaine branch had been established in 1895. They were referred to as the Women's Suffrage Movement. The fight for women's rights to vote finally was successful through laws in the 1900s. However, all white Australian women gained the right to vote in Federal elections in 1902. In 1903, Vida Goldstein became first woman in British Empire to stand for election to a national parliament. She was unsuccessful in the Australian elections of December that year. ==References== Category:Anti-suffragist organizations Category:Political organisations based in Australia Category:Women's suffrage in Australia ",
