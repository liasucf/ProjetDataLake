He was also the President of the Nigerian Association of Mathematical Physics and the Nigerian Mathematical Society. He was a former Vice Chancellor of Bendel State University (now Ambrose Alli University), Ekpoma, and a former Special Assistant to the Minister of Science & Technology in Nigeria. Recently before his death in 2018, he was an Environmental Pollution expert, consulting for various local and international organizations.
