In 2012, she was featured on the Disclosure track \"Boiling\" from their EP The Face. She released her debut single, \"Got Me\", in 2013 via Black Butter Records, and contributed songwriting and guest vocals to Rudimental's debut album, Home. She was also featured on Ryan Hemsworth's solo album Guilt Trips, on the opening track \"Small + Lost\", and provided uncredited vocals for Kidnap Kid's single \"So Close\". Her debut EP, N.O.W., was released in August 2014 through 333 Records; it includes the single \"No Other Way\", which The Guardian named track of the week. Another track on the EP, \"Paradise\", received the same honour from The Huffington Post. Snakehips, who are featured on \"No Other Way\", featured Harnett on their single \"Days with You\". By late 2014, she was recording her debut album with producer Chris Loco for release on Virgin EMI Records, and was shortlisted for MTV UK's Brand New for 2015 award. The album was originally due for release in 2015 and also features contributions from James Fauntleroy, Chloe Martini, KOZ, TMS, and Two Inch Punch.

Billboard wrote in 2013 that \"Harnett's rich, soulful voice and range has drawn comparisons to Adele, but her recordings are more experimental and contemporary\u2014a brand of jazz-tinged, melodic electronic pop a bit reminiscent of Jessie Ware or Jhen\u00e9 Aiko.\" ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== *Lessons In Love (2019) *Lessons In Love - Acoustic (2020) ===EPs=== *Got Me (2013) *N.O.W (2014) *She Ain't Me (2015) *Sin\u00e9ad Harnett (2016) ===Mixtapes=== *Chapter One (2017) ===Singles=== *\"Got Me\" (2013) *\"No Other Way\" (2014) *\"She Ain't Me\" (2015) *\"Do It Anyway\" (2015) *\"If You Let Me\" (2016) *\"Rather Be with You\" (2016) *\"Still Miss You\" (2017) *\"Unconditional\" (2017) *\"Body\" (2018) *\"System\" (2018) *\"Lessons\" (2018) *\"By Myself\" (2019) *\u201dLeo Bear\u201d (2019) *\"Pulling Away\" (2019) *\"Quarantine Queen\" (2020) *\"Stickin'\" (2020) ===Guest appearances=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Song !Album |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2011 |\"Walk Away\" ||Chill Out Zone |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"|2012 |\"Boiling\" | rowspan=\"2\"|The Face EP |- |\"What's in Your Head\" |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"4\"|2013 |\"So Close\" | |- |\"Hide\" | rowspan=\"2\"|Home |- |\"Baby\" |- |\"Small + Lost\" ||Guilt Trips |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2014 |\"Days with You\" | |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2015 |\"Treading on Water\" ||We the Generation |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2016 |\"Never Say Never?\" | |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2017 |\"Love in Ruins\" | |} ==References== Category:1989 births Category:21st-century English singers Category:Alumni of Arts University Bournemouth Category:Black Butter Records artists Category:English dance musicians Category:English people of Irish descent Category:English people of Thai descent Category:British contemporary R&B; singers Category:English soul singers Category:Living people Category:People from Finchley Category:Singers from London Category:Virgin Records artists Category:21st-century English women singers ",
