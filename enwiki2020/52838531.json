It gives the name to the Oreto Valley and crosses the south-east portion of the city before flowing into the Tyrrhenian Sea. Called \"W\u0101d\u012b al-\u02bfAbb\u0101s\" during the Islamic period, the river has had an important role in the history of Palermo. In the 12th century, in order to cross it, the Ammiratus ammiratorum George of Antioch built the Admiral's Bridge. == References == Category:Rivers of Italy Category:Rivers of Sicily Category:Rivers of Palermo Category:Rivers of the Province of Palermo Category:Drainage basins of the Tyrrhenian Sea ",
