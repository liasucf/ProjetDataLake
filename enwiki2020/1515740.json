    "text": "Los Pinos (Spanish: The Pines) was the official residence and office of the President of Mexico from 1934 to 2018. Located in the Bosque de Chapultepec (Chapultepec Forest) in central Mexico City, it became the presidential seat in 1934, when Gen. L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas became the first president to live there. The term Los Pinos became a metonym for the Presidency of Mexico. Since December 2018, the former presidential complex has operated as a cultural space. ==History== After the Spanish Conquest, around 1550 a trapiche (mill) was built in Chapultepec, where wheat and maize were processed into flour. This mill became so important that it was later called el Molino del Rey (\"The King's Mill\"). In 1853, the Molino del Rey was sold to Doctor Jos\u00e9 Pablo Martinez del Rio, who built the Casa Grande (\"Big House\") that would later become known as Rancho La Hormiga (\"The Ant Ranch\"). In 1865 the whole property was sold to Emperor Maximilian for a total of 25,000 Mexican pesos. Following the 1867 overthrow and execution of Maximilian, the property was, in 1872, returned to Doctor Martinez del Rio. ===Government residence=== In 1917, with the end of the armed phase of the Mexican Revolution, President Venustiano Carranza expropriated the properties, paying MX$ 886,473 for both the property and the construction of a residence that would be close to Chapultepec Castle (which at the time was used as the official residence) so that his most trustworthy cabinet member could live there. Because of this, the first inhabitant of the residence was \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n while he held the post of Navy and War Secretary. After his tenure the residence was unused. In 1934, President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas took office but refused to use the Castle of Chapultepec as his official residence as he thought it too ostentatious. He was offered use of Rancho la Hormiga (The Ant Ranch), which he accepted. He changed its name to Los Pinos (The Pines) for two reasons: first, he did not consider the name La Hormiga to be accordant with the residence of a President and, second, he promised his wife that when he became president, the house they shared would be named after the huerta in Tac\u00e1mbaro, Michoacan, where they met. Los Pinos was home to thirteen of the fourteen presidents in office between 1935 and 2018, with the exception of Adolfo L\u00f3pez Mateos (1958\u20131964). In 2000, President Vicente Fox chose one of the nearby cottages as his home and the Casa Miguel Alem\u00e1n (residence of most prior presidents) was used for offices and other government functions. ==Cultural space== Presidential Office at Los Pinos In 2018, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, at the time a candidate for the Mexican presidency, announced that he would not live in Los Pinos if he won the election and would instead open the residence to the public. L\u00f3pez Obrador won the election, and Los Pinos was opened to the public on December 1, 2018, the day of L\u00f3pez Obrador's presidential inauguration. L\u00f3pez Obrador moved the presidential offices back to the National Palace where he currently lives. ==References== ==External links== * Presidencia de la Rep\u00fablica website Category:Official residences in Mexico Category:Presidential residences *x Category:Buildings and structures in Mexico City Category:Miguel Hidalgo, Mexico City Category:Tourist attractions in Mexico City ",
