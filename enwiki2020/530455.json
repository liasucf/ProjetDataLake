The company was known as \"Sberbank of Russia\" until 2015. Sberbank has operations in several European and post-Soviet countries. it was the largest bank in Russia and Eastern Europe, and the third largest in Europe, ranked 33rd in the world and first in central and Eastern Europe in The Banker's Top 1000 World Banks ranking. ==History== Russian President Putin visits a Moscow branch of Sberbank, November 2001 Russian coin commemorating the establishment of the first savings banks in the Russian Empire in 1841. ===Early history=== Sberbank's history goes back to Cancrin's financial reform of 1841, when a network of the first state-owned savings banks was created in Russia. By the end of the 19th century, the network reached almost 4 thousand outlets with over 2 million depositors. Since 1905, savings bank outlets became authorised to sell insurance. After 1910, savings banks started subsidising credit cooperation institutions and extending loans to small lenders. In 1915, savings bank outlets started accepting government securities for depositing. ===Soviet savings banks system=== After the October Revolution of 1917, the state savings banks system continued its activity and growth under the management of the Finance Ministry of the USSR as the State Labour Savings Banks System. From 1926, the saving bank outlets were used to pay wages to blue- and white-collar workers. The savings banks were used to distribute state lottery tickets and for the placement of state bonds with the population. The savings banks introduced wider services such as money transfers. By late 1980s, the Soviet savings bank system had almost 80 thousand branches. As part of Perestroika reforms, in 1987 the savings bank outlets are reorganised into the Savings Bank of the USSR. Within the Savings bank of the USSR, separate savings banks were created in the Soviet Republics. Following the dissolution of the USSR, the former republican savings banks became state savings banks of the newly independent post-Soviet states. In 1991, the Savings bank of the RSFSR has been reorganised into the Joint-Stock Commercial Savings Bank of the Russian Federation (Sberbank of Russia). ===Sberbank of Russia=== In post-Soviet Russia, Sberbank is the largest universal bank despite growing competition from private and other state-owned commercial banks. The bank has gradually expanded its international presence. Since 2007, Sberbank is led by former economy minister Herman Gref. ===Volksbank International acquisition, 2011=== In 2011, Sberbank acquired Volksbank International AG from its shareholders \u00d6sterreichische Volksbanken AG, BPCE, DZ Bank and WGZ Bank. The deal included all VBI assets - banks in Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Ukraine, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, except for Volksbank Romania. The agreed price was \u20ac585 to \u20ac645 million, depending on VBI business performance in 2011. VBI's total assets excluding Romania was \u20ac9.4 billion in June 2011. On 16 December 2013, Volksbank (Ukraine), which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Sberbank, changed its name to \u00abVS Bank\u00bb (Ukrainian: \u0412\u0456\u0415\u0441 \u0411\u0430\u043d\u043a). ===Denizbank acquisition, 2012=== In June 2012 Sberbank bought the Turkish DenizBank for Turkish Lira 6,469 billion (about EUR 2,821 billion or US$3.504 billion) from the lender Dexia, which in 2011 was \"partly nationalized by the governments of France, Belgium and Luxembourg\". The deal included DenizBank subsidiaries in Turkey, Austria and Russia. ===US, EU, Switzerland, and Ukraine sanctions: 2014-2017=== After the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula by Russia in 2014, the Obama administration imposed targeted sanctions on 12 September 2014, through the US Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) by adding Sberbank and other entities to the Sectoral Sanctions Identifications (SSI) List. This was done in concert with 31 July 2014 addition of Sberbank to the European Union sanctions list. Sanctions consist of access restriction to the EU and US capital markets. After announcement of the sanctions, and by the end of July, Sberbank's market value had dropped the most market value among the world's major lenders plus investors moved $22 billion from Sberbank's market capitalization. Still, during the following year Sberbank's share price grew back 89%. Sberbank together with other Russian banks filed claims with the highest EU court to lift the punitive economic measures. On 27 August 2014, Switzerland imposed sanctions on Sberbank and other Russian financial institutions. On 22 December 2015, the United States imposed additional sanctions on Sberbank and its subsidiaries.

Poymanov=== Sergei Leonidovich Magnitsky accused numerous persons and entities of laundering stolen money in tax fraud in Russia. Owned by Denis Katsyv, Prevezon Holdings, represented by Natalia Vladimirovna Veselnitskaya, paid $6 million to resolve the claim without admitting any crime which subsequently led to all charges being dropped by the Justice Department in the summer of 2017. In United States court, Sergey P. Poymanov sued Sberbank, several of its subsidiaries and executives, and a business rival for $750 million, claiming that a valuable gravel quarry he owned was illegally bankrupted and seized by the bank in a corporate raid in 2012. Sberbank says it took the quarry as collateral after Mr. Poymanov failed to repay a loan. Sberbank is retaining Marc Kasowitz for this court case. Poymanov was subsequently arrested by Russian police who then subjected him to harsh pretrial detention at a notoriously rough Moscow jail, Matrosskaya Tishina, which is the same jail where Magnitsky died. ===Ukrainian sanctions and vandalism of Sberbank property=== Anti-Russian graffiti \"It's a Russian bank\" near the department of bank in Oleksandriia, Ukraine In April 2014, several Ukrainian officials accused Sberbank of funding the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine, including alleged terrorism. The bank denied any involvement in the financing of illegal activities on Ukrainian territory, which was later confirmed by an examination carried out by the National Bank of Ukraine. \"It is another instance of aggressive nationalism of neo-Nazi dogma that is gathering momentum in Ukraine and obviously enjoys support of official authorities of the country,\" the Russian foreign ministry stated. \"It seems to be no coincident that the attack on the Russian Center for Science and Culture was stages immediately after Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's odious speech at the Munich Security Conference, which was overfilled with anti- Russian pronouncements and openly called fight against the Russian flag across the globe,\" \"Ukraine\u2019s deliberate choice to be one of only two world nations voting against the United Nations General Assembly resolution against glorification of Nazism, neo-Nazism and other discriminatory practices demonstrate which side the current Kiev regime has chosen.\" the Russian ministry said. 15 March 2017, the president of Ukraine imposed sanctions on Sberbank (and other Russian state-owned banks operating in Ukraine: VTB Bank, BM Bank, Prominvestbank, and \u00abVS Bank\u00bb (Ukrainian: \u0412\u0456\u0415\u0441 \u0411\u0430\u043d\u043a)) as part of its continued sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea and involvement in the War in Donbass. Since then, Sberbank's Ukrainian subsidiary, \u00abVS Bank\u00bb (Ukrainian: \u0412\u0456\u0415\u0441 \u0411\u0430\u043d\u043a), has been put on sale. But it has been unsuccessfully trying to sell the asset after the National Bank of Ukraine blocked the sale of the bank due to a \"failure to provide the necessary and sufficient documents to carry out checks on the investors in compliance with Ukrainian law.\" In 2017 Sberbank was reported to be waiting for approval from the National Bank of Ukraine to sell its Ukrainian subsidiaries. \"Everything is prepared on our side. The question is whether we will be given a permission to sell or not by Ukrainian authorities,\" Herman Gref who is the chairman of Sberbank said on the World Economic Forum held in Davos in January 2018. On 13 December 2017, Sberbank sold another subsidiary, \u00abVS Bank\u00bb (Ukrainian: \u0412\u0456\u0415\u0441 \u0411\u0430\u043d\u043a), to a Ukrainian banker, former PrivatBank chairman Serhiy Tihipko. ===Troika Laundromat accusation in Lithuania=== In March 2019, the Troika Laundromat was exposed as an international money laundering network involving the Troika Dialog which is an investment bank that has been merged with the Sberbank's subsidiary Sberbank CIB. == See also == * Banking in Russia * Sberkassa * VTB Bank ==References== ==External links== * *Sberbank BIC Codes Category:Banks of Russia Category:Banks of the Soviet Union Category:Companies based in Moscow Category:Russian brands Category:Soviet brands Category:Banks established in 1841 Category:Companies listed on the Moscow Exchange Category:1841 establishments in the Russian Empire Category:Government-owned companies of Russia ",
