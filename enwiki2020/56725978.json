The forestry is the main economic activity of this valley; recreational tourism activities, second. The route 212 serves the village of Obedjiwan, Quebec which is located on a peninsula on the north shore of Gouin Reservoir. This road stretches north-east along the north shore of the Gouin Reservoir to a road curve located between Dubois Lake and Normandin Lake (Normandin River); then branches south-east to serve the east side of the Gouin Reservoir, and thus links La Tuque via the village of Wemotaci, Quebec. Some branches of forest roads serve the upper part of the valley of the Toussaint River. The surface of the Toussaint River is usually frozen from mid-November to the end of April, however, safe ice circulation is generally from early December to late March. == Geography == == Toponymy == Formerly, this watercourse was designated \"Baptiste River\" and \"rivi\u00e8re de la Rencontre\" (English: \"river of Encounter\").
