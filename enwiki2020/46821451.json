It will have a capacity of 20,000 barrels per day, along with 90% yield of light oil products. Once established, the refinery will reduce fuel cost, create up to 1500 jobs, and contribute to the state's economic growth. Operational licenses have since been granted by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) to facilitate the commencement and execution of the project. On 27 May 2015, it was announced that \u20a696 billion (US$ 480 million) has been budgeted for engineering procurement, construction, supervision and project management services. ==See also== *Port Harcourt Refining Company ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Rivers State Category:Economy of Rivers State Category:Energy in Rivers State Category:Oil refineries in Nigeria Category:Proposed energy projects ",
