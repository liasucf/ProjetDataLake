He designed several notable buildings; his masterpiece was the Customs House in Valletta. ==Biography== Bonici began drawing architectural plans at a young age, and he was apprenticed to the Maltese architect Giovanni Barbara and later the French military engineer Ren\u00e9 Jacob de Tign\u00e9. He made plans for the St. Publius Parish Church in Floriana in 1734, which solidified his fame as a master of religious architecture. His masterpiece is the Customs House in Valletta, which he designed in 1774. Bonici mainly designed buildings in the Baroque style, even when the style was being superseded by neoclassical architecture in the rest of Europe. Bonici held a number of positions throughout his career, including a substitute engineer at the Commissari Domorum, an examiner of those aspiring to be land surveyors, and Capomastro delle Fortificazioni della Fondazione Cotoner. Most notably, he held the post of Capomastro delle Opere della Religione, being the principal architect of the Order of St. John, from 1761 to his death in 1779.
