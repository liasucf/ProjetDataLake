The train services are operated by Nederlandse Spoorwegen. The station is directly next to the home stadium of FC Twente, de Grolsch Veste. The station is also used by university students, as it lies close to the campus of University of Twente. The station was originally called Enschede Drienerlo, named after the former Drienerlo estate, until it was renamed Enschede Kennispark on 13 December 2015. This is to reflect the redevelopment of the area around the station into a science park.2016 timetable changes ==Train services== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:85%;\" ! Route !
