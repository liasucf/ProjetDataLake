It was, along with Yamal 201 the second dual launch of the Yamal program and the second iteration of the USP Bus. It is a satellite with 4,080W of power (3.4 kW at end of life) on an unpressurized bus. It have eight SPT-70 electric thrusters by OKB Fakel for station keeping. Its payload is 18 C band transponders supplied by Space Systems Loral. ==History== During 1997, even before the launch of their first satellites (Yamal 101 and Yamal 102), Gazkom was planning the second generation. At that time they planned a 24 satellites of the second generation. This extremely aggressive plan was scaled back by 2001 with a plan to launch four 200 series satellites. The first two, Yamal 201 and Yamal 202 would be launched by 2001 and the second pair, Yamal 203 and Yamal 204 by 2004. Yamal 201 and Yamal 203 would be identical and be positioned at the 90\u00b0E slot and Yamal 202 and Yamal 204 would also be twins and be positioned at the 49\u00b0E slot. Yamal 202 was launched along Yamal 201 November 24, 2003 at 16:2 UTC from Baikonur Site 81/23 by a Proton-K/Blok-DM-2M directly to GEO. The launch and satellite deployment was successful and Yamal 201 was commissioned into service. As of July 22, 2016 it is still in service and at 12 years and 8 months it has surpassed its design life of 12.5 years. In 2019, on the replacement satellite \"Yamal-202\" launched satellite \"Yamal-601\"https://www.gazprom- spacesystems.ru/ru/new_projects/yamal_600/. July 19, 2019 all the networks working on the satellite \"Yamal-202\", have been transferred into the satellite \"Yamal-601\"https://www.gazprom- spacesystems.ru/ru/news/9059/https://www.cableman.ru/content/sputnik- yamal-601-vveli-v-ekspluatatsiyu. On September 16, 2019, at the IBC-2019 convention in Amsterdam, the transfer of the Yamal-202 satellite to the orbital position 163.5\u00b0 East longitude was announced to serve the Pacific regionhttp://tv41.ru/vystavka-ibc-2019-v-amsterdame. At the end of November 2019, the movement of the Yamal-202 satellite to the orbital position 163.5\u00b0 East longitude was successfully completedhttps://www.gazprom- spacesystems.ru/ru/infrastructure/?ELEMENT_ID=3497. After 16 years of working in 49\u00b0E position, in 2019 the satellite was transferred to a new orbital position of 163.5\u00b0Ehttps://www.gazprom- spacesystems.ru/en/infrastructure/?ELEMENT_ID=4142. ==See also== * Yamal 201 \u2013 Satellite that was launched together with Yamal 202. * Yamal \u2013 Communication satellite family operated by Gazprom Space Systems. * Gazprom Space Systems \u2013 Satellite communication division of the Russian oil giant Gazprom. * USP Bus \u2013 The satellite bus on which Yamal 202 is based. * RSC Energia \u2013 The designer and manufacturer of the Yamal 202 satellite. ==References== ==External links== * Yamal-202 technical performance Yamal-202 Category:Satellites using the USP bus Category:Spacecraft launched in 2003 Category:2003 in Russia Category:Spacecraft launched by Proton rockets ",
