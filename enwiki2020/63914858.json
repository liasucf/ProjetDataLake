    "text": "County Mayo's western seaboard This articles lists the islands of County Mayo, the mainland of which is part of the island of Ireland. Included in this list are named offshore and freshwater islands as recorded by Ordnance Survey Ireland or the Placenames Database of Ireland. Additionally, areas of ecological significance related to both offshore and freshwater islands, designated by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, are also listed. Although County Mayo has hundreds of offshore and freshwater islands, only a handful of islands and island groups are large enough to be distinguishable on a typical map of the county, namely Achill Island, Clare Island and Inishturk, along with the island clusters of Duvillaun, Inishkea, Clew Bay and the major loughs. There are over 100 islands which are greater than in area. The largest island is Achill, which extends to , making it Ireland's largest offshore island. Due to its abundance of bays, inlets and offshore islands, Mayo has the longest coastline of any county in Ireland, at or approximately 21% of the total coastline of the State. The geology and geomorphology of the county and its islands is among the most varied and complex in Ireland. Islands such as those at Clew Bay are low-lying, formed when rising sea levels drowned a vast field of drumlins, while others like Clare Island and Achill are characterised by mountains and towering sea-cliffs, of which Croaghaun are the third-highest in Europe, at The bedrock geology of the islands is broadly divided into two groups. Those north of Clew Bay such as Achill and the islands off the Mullet Peninsula are generally of ancient Dalradian age, similar to Donegal and the Grampian Highlands. Inishglora contains some of the oldest rocks in Ireland, at 1.75 billion years old. Further south, the islands are much more diverse. Clare island alone is composed of Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian and Carboniferous terranes sutured together. Geologically, the Clew Bay islands themselves are the youngest in the county, formed during the Lower Carboniferous about 350 million years ago. The county's offshore islands - and islands off the west coast of Ireland generally - developed their own distinct culture and traditions stretching back centuries. Records from the 1841 Census show that 47 of County Mayo's offshore islands were inhabited, with a combined population of approximately 10,000.These islands were decimated by the Great Famine, resulting in either widespread or total depopulation. Towards the end of the 19th century the population of the larger islands began to recover somewhat, only to be set back by emigration following independence. The Irish government initially encouraged the evacuation of the islands due to the cost of providing services to them, further hastening the decline. Today, the islands are recognised by the State as an integral part of Ireland's national heritage, preserving the remnants of a unique aspect of Irish culture. The remaining inhabited islands receive support and funding through the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. As of the 2016 Census, there are 2,700 people living on 14 of the county's offshore islands (of which 2,440 live on Achill), accounting for 1.87% of the county's population. Achill is Ireland's largest island Clew Bay contains 141 named islands, along with numerous tidal islets ==Islands of Mayo by Population== ===Demographics=== The 2016 census records 14 offshore islands as having a usually resident population. Achill has been connected to the mainland via bridge since 1887, making Clare Island the county's most populous unconnected island, with 159 inhabitants as of 2016. This makes Clare Island the fifth-most populous unconnected island in Ireland, after the three Aran Islands off Galway and Arranmore off Donegal. Deserted village on Achill Mayo County Council is responsible for the governance of the islands, and islanders are entitled to certain benefits and exemptions, such as lower motor tax rates. The islands also receive funding from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, as several offshore islands along with much of northwest Mayo are recognised Gaeltacht areas. Fish curing on Clare Island, c. 1900 As many as 47 offshore islands had permanent populations prior to the Great Famine. Communities had resided on these islands for generations, and their remains can still be seen to this day through the villages, stone walls and lazybeds which they left behind. By the end of the 19th century most of the county's islands had been deserted. In contrast, Achill benefitted from a bridge to the mainland which allowed the population to temporarily rebound, reaching its all-time peak in 1911. Emigration from the islands continued into the 20th-century as traditional industries such as fishing and textiles were unable to provide an attractive, or in many cases adequate, income to young islanders. In recent times, the islands have become a popular tourist destination and depend heavily on the tourism and hospitality sector. Their population swells during the summer months, particularly on Achill and Clare. Popular activities include surfing, sailing, island-hopping in Clew Bay, spiritual retreats and eco-tourism. The following table shows population trends for the fourteen currently inhabited islands as of the last census. The overall trend is a continuing decline in the population of Mayo's offshore islands, which is currently at a historic low. The county as a whole was one of just three in Ireland to record a population decrease between 2011 and 2016. The population of Mayo during this time decreased by 0.2%, whereas the population of the islands fell by 5.3%. Although the overall population fell during this time, four previously uninhabited islands received new residents, including Achillbeg, which had been uninhabited since 1965. ===Currently Inhabited Islands=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:75%\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"|Rank ! rowspan=\"2\"|Island ! rowspan=\"2\"|Barony ! colspan=\"4\"|Population |- ! 2016 ! 2011 ! 1841 !

Four of these are offshore, and two of these are freshwater islands. They are listed below: * Church Island Monastery (F) * Clare Island Abbey * Duvillaun Monastery * Inishkea North Monastery * Inishglora Monastery * Partry Monastery (F) In addition to the above sites, many more islands within the county have been used for religious purposes. The ruins of old churches and cemeteries can be found scattered across such islands. ==Biodiversity== Many of the county's offshore and freshwater islands are designated as areas of ecological significance and are protected both at national and European level. Mayo's offshore islands are a haven for wildlife and biodiversity, supporting hundreds of species of bird, fish and marine mammal, as well as unique vegetation. Five of the county's major inland lakes (along with their islands) are also protected, those being Lough Mask, Lough Conn, Lough Cullin, Lough Carra and Carrowmore Lake.National Parks and Wildlife Service - Protected Sites The biodiversity of the islands is protected under the following designations. There is overlap across designations, as different designations apply to different species, e.g. the Duvillaun Islands are an SAC, SPA and proposed NHA. * Special Area of Conservation (SAC) - These are prime wildlife conservation areas in the country, considered to be important on a European as well as Irish level. * Special Protection Area (SPA) - Classified under the EU Birds Directive for the protection of endangered species of wild birds. * Natural Heritage Area (NHA) - This is an area considered important for the habitats present or which holds species of plants and animals whose habitat needs protection. The following areas of ecological significance are located either on or adjacent to County Mayo's offshore islands. The five major inland lakes listed as SPAs are also included, and are shown in italics in the list below. Atlantic Puffin (Fratercula arctica) Grey Seal (Halichoerus grypus) Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) Bog Cotton (Eriophorum angustifolium) Razorbill (Alca torda) Basking Shark (Cetorhinus maximus) Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) Black crowberry (Empetrum nigrum) ===Special Areas of Conservation=== *Mullet/Blacksod Bay Complex *West Connacht Coast *Erris Head *Inishkea Islands *Duvillaun Islands *Broadhaven Bay *Killala Bay/Moy Estuary *Croaghaun/Slievemore *Achill Head *Keel Machair/Menaun Cliffs *Doogort Machair/Lough Doo *Clew Bay Complex *Corraun Plateau *Lough Gall Bog *Clare Island Cliffs ===Special Protection Areas=== Italics indicates that the SPA is an inland lake *Blacksod Bay/Broadhaven Bay *Inishglora and Inishkeeragh *Inishkea Islands *Duvillaun Islands *Stags of Broad Haven *Illanmaster *Killala Bay/Moy Estuary *Doogort Machair *Bills Rocks *Clare Island *Mullet Peninsula *Termoncarragh Lake & Annagh Machair *Lough Mask *Lough Conn & Lough Cullin *Lough Carra *Carrowmore Lake ===Natural Heritage Areas=== * Tullaghan Bay & Bog * Doogort East Bog * Sraheens Bog ===Proposed Natural Heritage Areas=== *Killala Bay/Moy Estuary *Glenamoy Bog Complex *Stags Of Broadhaven *Broadhaven Bay *Erris Head *Eagle Island *Mullet/Blacksod Bay Complex *Inishglora & Inishkeeragh *Inishkea Islands *Duvillaun Islands *Croaghaun/Slievemore *Doogort Machair/Lough Doo *Inishgalloon *Keel Machair/Menaun Cliffs *Corraun Plateau *Lough Gall Bog *Bills Rocks *Clare Island *Clew Bay Complex *Mweelaun Island *Caher Island *Ballybeg Island *Inishturk *Inishdalla *Frehill Island *Inishdegil Islands ==Island Index== File:Achill Island in inset - County Mayo.svg|Achill Island File:Clare Island in inset with Achill - County Mayo.svg|Clare Island File:Inishturk (with inset) - County Mayo.svg|Inishturk File:Inishkea North (with inset) - County Mayo.svg|Inishkea North File:Inishkea South (with inset) - County Mayo.svg|Inishkea South File:Achillbeg in inset with Achill - County Mayo.svg|Achillbeg File:Annagh Island in inset with Achill - County Mayo.svg|Annagh Island File:Caher Island (with inset) - County Mayo.svg|Caher Island File:Barranagh Island (with inset) - County Mayo.svg|Barranagh Island File:Inishbiggle in inset with Achill - County Mayo.svg|Inishbiggle File:Eagle Island (with inset) - County Mayo.svg|Eagle Island File:Inishglora (with inset) - County Mayo.svg|Inishglora ==Notes== ==References== ==See also== *List of loughs of County Mayo *List of mountains and hills of County Mayo Category:Islands of County Mayo Category:Gaeltacht places in County Mayo Category:Geography of Ireland ",
