The Outside Game gives athletes and contributors a real opportunity to address issues not exclusive to sport, and with a genuine voice and point of view rather than through the lens of corporate PR avenues.\" The first event under the rebrand was held September 5, 2019 at SubCulture in New York City and featured conversations with athletes PacMan Jones, Robin Lehner, Joanna Lohman, Alex Cavallini, and Jonathan Casillas, and media figures such as Greg Mescall, Erin Ashley Simon, Jeff Eisenband, Bleacher Report's Ben Osborne, and more.
