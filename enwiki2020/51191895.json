    "text": "Mari Gilbert (June 22, 1964 \u2013 July 23, 2016) was an American activist and murder victim advocate. ==Biography== Gilbert was an advocate for her daughter, Shannan, a 24-year-old woman from New Jersey who disappeared in May 2010; the investigation of Shannan's disappearance led to the discovery of ten homicide victims scattered along Ocean Parkway in New York. Investigators believed that Shannan died of an accidental drowning that was unrelated to the crimes of the Long Island serial killer, but Gilbert challenged the finding and fought to have the case reopened as a murder investigation. An independent autopsy sought by Gilbert's family found that Shannan may have been strangled to death. Gilbert and her other daughters (Sarra, Sherre) frequently appeared on television shows discussing the case. ===Death=== Gilbert was stabbed to death by one of her daughters, Sarra, in Sarra's apartment building on Warren Street in Ellenville, New York on July 23, 2016. Sarra suffered from schizophrenia. One report claimed that Sarra \"had voices in her head telling her to carry out the crime.\" Sarra was charged with second-degree murder and fourth-degree possession of a weapon, convicted of murder, and sentenced to 25 years in jail in August 2017. She is imprisoned in the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women. == In popular culture == === Cinema === * In the 2020 Netflix original film Lost Girls, Gilbert is portrayed by Amy Ryan. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:American activists Category:American television personalities Category:1964 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Murdered activists Category:American murder victims Category:People murdered in New York (state) Category:Violence against women in the United States ",
