    "text": "SS Kamchatka was a Russian steamship, which entered service as a repair ship in the Russian Baltic Fleet in 1903. The ship was infamous for its actions during the voyage of the Second Pacific Squadron, where it precipitated the Dogger Bank incident, as well as numerous other incidents including misidentification of neutral vessels as torpedo boats, and mistakenly firing on the Russian cruiser Aurora. The ship was lost with all hands when it was sunk in 1905 during the Battle of Tsushima. ==External links== * https://www.history.navy.mil/our-collections/photography/numerical-list-of- images/nhhc-series/nh-series/NH-94000/NH-94385.html * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCrAQFBUFlU * https://www.hullwebs.co.uk/content/l-20c/disaster/dogger-bank/voyage-of- dammed.htm Category:Steamships of Russia Category:1903 ships ",
