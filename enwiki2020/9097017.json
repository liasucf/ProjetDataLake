Soon after its formation the lake was called the East Omaha Lake, and then Lake Nakoma. ==History== Carter Lake is a former channel of the Missouri River and was formed in the summer of 1877. The city of Carter Lake, Iowa takes its name from the lake. The lake was formed from the Saratoga Bend in the Missouri River. View of Eppley Airfield with Carter Lake visible to the right The Saratoga Bend was the impetus for the creation of the town of Saratoga, Nebraska Territory, a short mile from the river. However, the Bend was cut off from the river after a flood in 1877. A beach resort with a large boathouse and two-story pavilion, a Rod and Gun Club, and a YMCA camp had all settled on the shores of Lake Nakoma by 1906. The Carter Lake and Levi Carter Park at 3100 Abbott Drive were named after one of Omaha's original industrialists named Levi Carter, who ran a white lead smelter in the area. ==See also== *East Omaha, Nebraska *Carter Lake, Iowa *Saratoga, Nebraska Territory *History of North Omaha, Nebraska == References == ==External links== *History of Carter Lake with pictures and maps *Historical photo of canoeing and of the Omaha Rod & Gun Club Cabins at Lake Nakoma (Carter Lake) * Category:Geography of Omaha, Nebraska Category:Bodies of water of Pottawattamie County, Iowa Category:Landmarks in North Omaha, Nebraska Category:Oxbow lakes of the United States Category:Lakes of Iowa Category:Lakes of Nebraska Category:Parks in Omaha, Nebraska Category:Missouri River Category:Defunct resorts Category:Borders of Iowa Category:Borders of Nebraska ",
