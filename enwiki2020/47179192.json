Later transferred to the carrier air wing aboard (VF-3), Holt participated in the air operations over Guadalcanal, defending the Marines in their beachhead ashore. On 7 August 1942, after sighting a group of about 27 enemy bombers with escorts, Lieutenant (j.g.) Holt led his two-plane section through the enemy fighters, downing several, and helped to turn back the bombers, continuing his relentless attacks until his own aircraft was shot down. Holt was killed in action. Holt was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his heroism. The Rudderow-class destroyer escort Holt was named for him. == References == Category:Recipients of the Navy Cross (United States) Category:United States Navy officers Category:American naval personnel killed in World War II Category:1917 births Category:1942 deaths Category:People from Great Falls, Montana Category:United States Navy pilots of World War II ",
