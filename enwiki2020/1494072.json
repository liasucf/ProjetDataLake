    "text": "The Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment (or The Bartlett) is the academic centre for the study of the built environment at University College London (UCL), part of the University of London in London, United Kingdom. It is home to twelve departments that have expertise in individual fields of the built-environment, including the Bartlett School of Architecture, Bartlett School of Planning, Bartlett Development Planning Unit, and Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis. The Bartlett is consistently ranked the highest in Europe and the UK and among the highest in the world for the \"Architecture and the Built-Environment\" category in all major rankings. In the 2019 QS World University Rankings, it was ranked first in the world, but fell to third in the 2020 Rankings. == Background == 22 Gordon Street faculty building University College London created its first chair of architecture in 1841, making The Bartlett the first architecture and built environment school established in the UK. A Chair in Planning was created at UCL in 1914 and The Department of Urban Planning then merged with the School of Architecture. The faculty was named The Bartlett in 1919 when the original benefactor, Sir Herbert Bartlett consented to his name being given to the department. It is currently one of UCL's 11 constituent faculties. == Buildings and resources == The school has two London sites, the UCL campus in Bloomsbury and Here East at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. On the UCL campus, The Bartlett Faculty and The Bartlett School of Architecture are based at 22 Gordon Street since 2016, which was built around the retained structure of the old building, Wates House. Five of The Bartlett's departments (the School of Planning and Institutes of Sustainable Resources, Sustainable Heritage, Environmental Design & Engineering and the Energy Institute) and its library are located in Central House. The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management is housed in 1-19 Torrington Place. The Bartlett Development Planning Unit is located in 34 Tavistock Square. In 2017, The Bartlett and UCL Engineering expanded into new facilities at Here East, on the site of the London Olympics Media Centre. The Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis is located in 90 Tottenham Court Road. == Rankings == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ Global Ranking Table for Architecture, the Built-Environment, and Urban Studies !Ranking !2020 !2019 !2018 !2017 !2016 !2015 |- |The Guardian University Guide |2 |4 |3 |2 |1 |2 |- |- |CWUR Subject Ranking |2 |N/A |N/A |2 |N/A |N/A |- |QS World Ranking |3 |1 |2 |2 |N/A |N/A |- |The Complete University Guide |4 |4 |3 |4 |6 |4 |- |Times World Ranking |5 |6 |5 |4 |5 |8 |} == Education == The Bartlett Summer Show in 2017 The Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment is the UK's largest and leading multidisciplinary faculty of the built environment, covering architecture, planning, construction and project management, development planning and environmental design as well as many other specialist fields. It is particularly well known for its architecture and planning schools following the leadership of Sir Peter Cook and Sir Peter Hall respectively in the 1990s. The faculty undertakes research in the built environment, and is known for developing the space syntax theory.

The Centre is originator for OpenStreetMap, Prospective Labs, GeoFutures, and Intelligent Space (acquired by Atkins). Today, the Centre works with numerous public administrations, inter-governmental organisations, and private institutions globally to research and address urban issues. The Centre has conferred some 50 PhDs since 2000. More recently, it has opened up postgraduate courses at masters-level in Smart Cities and Urban Analytics, Spatial Data Science and Visualisation (both taught and research), and, since 2020, a new course on Connected Environments. === The Bartlett Development Planning Unit === The Bartlett Development Planning Unit (DPU) was founded in 1954 by Otto K\u00f6nigsberger. Formerly the Architectural Association Department of Tropical Studies, it was absorbed by UCL and joined The Bartlett Faculty in 1971. In the early 1990s, Prof Caren Levy established the Gender Policy and Planning Programme, one of only four internationally recognised programmes addressing gender inequality in this period. It runs a doctoral research programme leading to the award of PhD, six one-year master's degree courses and a professional Postgraduate Diploma. The current Head of the DPU is Professor Julio Davila, and the previous one was Professor Caren Levy. The DPU is the founding partner of the Knowledge in Action for Urban Equality consortium with contributors across nine countries that aims to make cities fairer. === The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management === Duccio Turin founded the Building Economics Research Unit at UCL in the 1960s and The Bartlett ran masters and undergraduate degrees in building economics and management in the early 1970s, which are still running to this day.
