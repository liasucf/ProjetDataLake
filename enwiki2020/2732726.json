Established in the early 1920s in a low-income white area, it later became majority-black and black- run. The district had a history of financial and academic issues from the late 1980s until 2013. On July 1, 2013, it was closed by order of the state and absorbed into the Houston Independent School District (HISD). ==History== William G. Smiley School - Served as the W.G.

By the 1970s, when the area was suburban and still mostly white, the state mandated racial integration of schools. African-American families moved to North Forest for the perceived quality of the schools. After desegregation, many white families moved to other communities along U.S. Highway 59, such as Aldine, Humble, and Porter, and African-American families became the majority and gained political control of NFISD. By the late 1970s it was one of the largest black-run school districts in the state;Wray, Dianna. \"Everyone Says They Want the Best for North Forest Students, As Long As They Stand to Benefit.\" Houston Press.
