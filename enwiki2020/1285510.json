    "text": "Sound of the engine in a BMW E39 The BMW M57 is a straight-6 diesel engine produced from 1998. It is produced in the upper Austrian engine plant in Steyr. == Description == The M57 is a water-cooled and turbocharged inline six cylinder diesel engine with common-rail-injection. It was revised twice during its production time. It is based on its predecessor M51. The block and the crankcase of the first M57 engines and the T\u00dc (Technische \u00dcberarbeitung = revision) engines are made of cast iron, whilst the T\u00dc2 engines are made of aluminium instead. The combustion chamber was also changed in the T\u00dc2. The injection pressure is in the non T\u00dc engine , whilst all other engines use a pressure of . For fuel injection, magnetic injectors are used, except from the T\u00dc2 OL and TOP engines, which make use of piezo injectors. The common-rail- system is made by Bosch and also controlled by a Bosch DDE 4 ECU for non T\u00dc and DDE 5 ECU for T\u00dc. All models are equipped with turbocharger and an intercooler. The 2.9L M57, which is found in E39 530d and E38 730d, as well as early models of E46 330d and E53 X5, is equipped with one Garrett GT2556V turbocharger. The 2.5L M57T\u00dc uses a Garrett GT2056V turbocharger, the 3.0L M57T\u00dc a Garrett GT2260V turbocharger, the M57T\u00dc2 a Garrett GT2260VK turbocharger, whilst the M57D30T\u00dcTOP sports a BorgWarner KP39 high-pressure and a K26 low-pressure turbocharger. The compression ratio reaches from 16.5:1 to 18.0:1, M57 engines with higher power output and more than one turbocharger have a lower compression ratio. Every cylinder has two inlet and two exhaust valves as well as two chain-driven overhead camshafts. The redline is 4750 rpm. ==Technical Data== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#cccccc;\" ! Engine !! Bore \u00d7 Stroke!! Displacement !! Power !! Torque !!
