    "text": "Sergei Lvovich Nikolaev (; born 25 December 1954) is a Soviet and Russian linguist, specialist in comparative historical linguistics, Slavic accentology and dialectology. Author of a number of books and articles on Indo-European studies, accentology, and Slavic dialectology. Doctor Nauk in Philological Sciences. ==Biography== Nikolaev graduated from the philological faculty of Tver State University and Moscow State University. Since 1986, he works at the Institute for Slavic and Balkan studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Since 1987, he has been the head of regular dialectological expeditions in the area of East Slavic subdialects. In 1992, he received a doctoral degree with a dissertation comprising the totality of his works, and now heads the group of Slavic glottogenesis. ==Contribution to linguistics== Sergei Nikolaev is a specialist in Slavic and Indo-European comparative historical linguistics. The scope of studies covers Slavic, Balto-Slavic and Indo-European historical accentology, comparative grammar of North Caucasian languages, hypothetical Sino-Caucasian macro-family of languages, hypothetical Amerindian macro- family. Nikolaev connects the linguogeography and historical dialectology of Slavic languages with the problems of . In East Slavic dialectology, he established a number of the oldest (Late Proto-Slavic) dialect isoglosses. Reconstruction of the placement of these isoglossae on the territory of the oldest Slavic settlement showed their connection with the archaeological areas of large Proto-Slavic tribal associations. As a result of the field studies of the East Slavic dialects, the Institute has collected an East Slavic phonetic library and an archive of dialect recordings. Experimental research of phonetics and prosody of East Slavic dialect systems on a computer allowed Nikolaev to discover a number of new and poorly studied phenomena in modern East Slavic dialects. Nikolaev published and prepared for printing more than 80 works with a total volume of more than 240 author's sheets. He is the author of the etymological dictionary of North Caucasian languages (together with Sergei Starostin, 70 author's sheets), one of the authors of the series \"Fundamentals of Slavic accentology\", a participant in the international Internet projects \"Evolution of language\" and \"tower of Babel\" (etymological databases; he created a comparative database on Indo-European languages, which is based on the project of a new Indo-European dictionary, databases on Finno- Ugric and Amerindian languages). For more than 20 years, Nikolaev has been the leader and organizer of complex linguistic expeditions to the East Slavic dialects (the Carpathians, the Russian Northwest, Belarus, Polesie) and to the archaic Old Shtokavian dialects of the Serbo-Croatian language (Slavonia, together with Croatian colleagues), author of special field programs on East Slavic historical dialectology. He made presentations at four International Congresses of Slavists, a number of International and Russian conferences, for 10 years taught a course and led a seminar on \u201cHistorical Linguogeography of East Slavic Languages\u201d at the Faculty of Philology of Moscow State University. Nikolaev was nominated three times as a Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences (in 2003 and 2016 \u2014 by the Institute of Slavonic studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, in 2006 \u2014 personally by Vladimir Dybo). In 2004, he was awarded the Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Society (Montreal, Canada). Member of the editorial board of the International Journal of Slavic Studies Slov\u011bne = \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0463\u043d\u0435. In 2014, after placing the accents, Nikolaev confirmed (with a significant transformation and many clarifications) 's idea of syncretic polyrhythm The Tale of Igor's Campaign.Nikolaev, S. L.

In 1970, in Tuva, he caught two new taxa of the Satyrinae genus Oeneis (described by Yuri Korshunov as Oeneis judini and O. shurmaki). During 1980\u20131985, he collected a large collection of Lepidoptera in the Tver Oblast, now located in the Siberian zoomuseum, and described the presumably new taxon Erebia polonina. Together with Yuri Korshunov, he wrote articles on North Asian Oeneis and Erebia (the last article includes E. polonina). ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== * Category:Linguists from Russia Category:Linguists from the Soviet Union Category:20th-century linguists Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Slavists Category:Paleolinguists Category:Full Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences Category:Long-range comparative linguists ",
