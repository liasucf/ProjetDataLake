It was awarded for a lifetime, but it could have been lost if the recipient would have lost his Romanian citizenship, or would have suffered a penal sentence. While initially the medal was to be used only by the recipient, in 1939 King Carol II of Romania authorised, for superior ranks only, the inheritance of the medal by the eldest son or older brother of the deceased recipient, who would become an active army officer. The inherited medal would receive a new clasp, inscribed Tradi\u021bie (tradition), and would have to be confirmed by royal decree ==Description== The dark iron cross has a diameter of 40 mm. Each rhombic arm measures 10 mm on the exterior and 7 mm on the interior. In the center of the cross, there is a 13 mm circle. The external borders of the cross and the circle have 1.3 mm. Inside the circle, on the obverse, there is the royal cypher of King Ferdinand I of Romania (two Fs facing away with a royal crown on top), while on the reverse there is inscribed 1916|1918 on the early models and 1916|1919 on later models, in two rows. The 30 mm ribbon alternates four equal bars of dark blue with three equal bars of green. ==Clasps== Seventeen clasps were approved for the medal: eleven in the original Decree from 1918, three in 1919, one in 1920, one in 1927 and one in 1939. These clasps consist of small metal bars into which the name of the relevant campaign or theatre of operations was moulded (except for the last one). The clasps were then attached transversally to the medal's suspension bar. # Ardeal # Cerna # Jiul - actually Jiu on existing clasps # Carpa\u021bi # Oituz # Bucure\u0219ti # Turtucaia # Dobrogea # M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti # M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti # T\u00e2rgu-Ocna # Dun\u0103rea # 1918 # 1919 # Siberia # Italia # Tradi\u021bie ==Usage and hierarchy== The medal was displayed on official occasions and ceremonies on the left breast of the jacket.
