He served as France's diplomatic representative in England between 1444 and 1449, during a period of truce between the two countries. == Biography == Guillaume Cousinot de Montreuil was nicknamed Guillaume Cousinot II or Le Jeune (The young), due to his being the son of Guillaume Cousinot le Chancelier. This family link was long debated by historians. Until the 19th century, they were primarily thought of as an uncle and a nephew until the archivist Jules Doinel, based on historical documents, proved they were indeed father and son. Guillaume was a student at the University of Orl\u00e9ans where he graduated as a Licenci\u00e9 \u00e8s lois; his father funded his education with the property he owned in Beauce, which was taken from the Burgundian Faction. Apart from his diplomat occupation, he was also a poet and historian. Between 1418 and 1436, he fought for the Armagnac Faction. He received the duty of Grand Maistre Gouverneur and judge of the mines and outbuildings, and then Chancellor and Chamberlain of the Kings Charles VII and Louis XI. Finally, he was appointed as Conseiller et Ma\u00eetre des requ\u00eates \u00e0 l\u2019H\u00f4tel du Roi. He became lord of Montreuil from 1456 until his death. On his seal, a lady holds in one hand a heater shield, and in the other a helm. In 1438, he became the secretary of the king, and then Conseiller et Ma\u00eetre des requ\u00eates \u00e0 l\u2019H\u00f4tel du Roi. During that time, he was also named commissioner of the king and was charged with the administration and finance. In 1442, he becomes the first president of the Conseil delphinal, who would soon become the Parliament of the Dauphin\u00e9 due to his function as an advisor of the prince Louis, who would become Louis XI. Between 1444 and 1449, he is appointed as diplomat and sent in an embassy to England during a truce between the two countries. He is made knight during the siege of Rouen, and subsequently made Bailiff of the city from 1449 to 1461. In 1451, he is made ambassador to the Scottish Court, but is shipwrecked on English coasts, captured and kept captive for 3 years. He is ransomed by Charles VII by a ransom of 20,000 \u00e9cus levied from a salt tax on Normandy. In 1459, Cousinot de Montreuil represents the king at the Council of Mantua in Italy and would become his ambassador in Rome. In 1461, Charles VII dies, and his son, Louis XI, succeeds him. Louis XI puts Guillaume Cousinot de Montreuil in jail, before changing his mind and making him his chamberlain. He is named concierge of the Conciergerie, and also made captain of Cabri\u00e8res in Languedoc, following the Treaty of Bayonne. He obtained the titles of Lord of Lattes-l\u00e8s-Montpellier, captain of Sauxes (Salses), near Perpignan and governor and bailiff of Montpellier. In a letter of Louis XI from Abbeville on September 29, 1464, he is cited as one of the king's advisors and knights. In 1465, he stays loyal to his king during the Ligue du Bien public, for this, Louis XI rewards him with an increase in his pension ranging from 600 to 3000 francs. In 1467, he starts writing a medieval historical chronicle, the \"Chronique de la Pucelle\". The chronicle is introduced by parts of the chronicle written by his father, the \"Geste des Nobles\" and then tells the life of Joan of Arc . However, the historian Craig Taylor states that Cousinot is not the author of this chronicle, attributing to him a polemic treatise defending the Valois monarchy against its English counterpart, titled *Pour ce que Plusieurs (La Loy Salique)*, probably written in 1465 in the context of the meetings between Louis XI and Edward IV. In 1469, he writes a poetic text, in verse and in prose, R\u00e9ponse \u00e0 Robertet sur le d\u00e9part de la belle \u00c9tiennette. In 1470 he is made ambassador to Rome. In 1483, after the death of Louis XI, Guillaume, despite being extremely old, is an advisor of new king, Charles VIII of France. In 1484, he attends the Estates General in Tours and dies the same year. ==References== Category:1400 births Category:1484 deaths Category:People of the Hundred Years' War Category:15th-century French people Category:Medieval French diplomats Category:1440s in England Category:15th- century diplomats ",
