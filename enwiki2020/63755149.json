In addition to exhibits, the show included events like curated meals, talks from local and international foodies, and selected recipes. A major component of the exhibition were the feeding times, prepared by the in-gallery kitchen, where visitors got the chance to experience various ingredients and curious tasters such as the vegan ortolan created by the Center for Genomic Gastronomy. == Art== ===The Cloud Project (2009-2011)=== The Cloud Project was a modified ice-cream van that presented a series of experiments to make clouds snow ice-cream. Inspired by developments in planetary-scale engineering, it pointed to ambitions surrounding the human desire to control the weather. Developed in collaboration with Zoe Papadopoulou, its purpose was as a tool for public engagement, performance, and spectacle, with the goal to amaze and inspire people to think critically about their relationship to emerging technologies and weather modification. The van was exhibited in Ireland, the UK and Beijing, China. ==References== Category:Norwegian designers Category:Norwegian artists Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
