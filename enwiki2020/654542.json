He is considered to be one of the most famous and influential Brazilian Romantic novelists of the 19th century, and a major exponent of the literary tradition known as \"Indianism\". Sometimes he signed his works with the pen name Erasmo. He was patron of the 23rd chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters. ==Biography== The house where Jos\u00e9 de Alencar was born and lived in until 1844, in the Messejana neighborhood, in Fortaleza Jos\u00e9 Martiniano de Alencar was born in Messejana, Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1, on May 1, 1829, to politician Jos\u00e9 Martiniano Pereira de Alencar and his cousin Ana Josefina de Alencar. His family was a rich and influential clan in Northeastern Brazil, his grandmother being famous landowner Barbara Pereira de Alencar, heroine of the Pernambucan Revolution. Moving to S\u00e3o Paulo in 1844, he graduated in Law at the Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo in 1850 and started his career in law in Rio de Janeiro. Invited by his friend Francisco Otaviano, he became a collaborator for the journal Correio Mercantil. He also wrote many chronicles for the Di\u00e1rio do Rio de Janeiro and the Jornal do Commercio. Alencar would compile all the chronicles he wrote for these newspapers in 1874, under the name Ao Correr da Pena. It was in the Di\u00e1rio do Rio de Janeiro, during the year of 1856, that Alencar gained notoriety, writing the Cartas sobre A Confedera\u00e7\u00e3o dos Tamoios, under the pseudonym Ig. In them, he bitterly criticized the homonymous poem by Gon\u00e7alves de Magalh\u00e3es. Even the Brazilian Emperor Pedro II, who esteemed Magalh\u00e3es very much, participated in this polemic, albeit under a pseudonym. Also in 1856, he wrote and published under feuilleton form his first romance, Cinco Minutos, that received critical acclaim. In the following year, his breakthrough novel, O Guarani, was released; it would be adapted into a famous opera by Brazilian composer Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Gomes 13 years later. O Guarani would be first novel of what is informally called Alencar's \"Indianist Trilogy\" \u2013 a series of three novels by Alencar that focused on the foundations of the Brazilian nation, and on its indigenous peoples and culture. The other two novels, Iracema and Ubirajara, would be published on 1865 and 1874, respectively. Although called a trilogy, the three books are unrelated in their plots. Alencar was affiliated with the Conservative Party of Brazil, being elected as a general deputy for Cear\u00e1. He was the Brazilian Minister of Justice from 1868 to 1870, having famously opposed the abolition of slavery.https://www.hedra.com.br/livros/cartas-a- favor-da-escravidao He also planned to be a senator, but Pedro II never appointed him, under the pretext of Alencar being too young;RODRIGUES, Antonio Edmilson Martins; FALCON, Francisco Jos\u00e9 Calazans.

He was very close friends with the also famous writer Machado de Assis, who wrote an article in 1866 praising his novel Iracema, that was published the year before, comparing his Indianist works to Gon\u00e7alves Dias, saying that \"Alencar was in prose what Dias was in poetry\". When Assis founded the Brazilian Academy of Letters in 1897, he chose Alencar as the patron of his chair. Monument to Jos\u00e9 de Alencar in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In 1864 he married Georgina Augusta Cochrane, daughter of an eccentric British aristocrat. They would have six children \u2013 Augusto (who would be the Brazilian Minister of External Relations in 1919, and also the Brazilian ambassador on the United States from 1920 to 1924), Clarisse, Ceci, Elisa, M\u00e1rio (who would be a journalist and writer, and a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters) and Ad\u00e9lia. (It is implied that M\u00e1rio de Alencar was actually an illegitimate son of Machado de Assis, a fact that inspired Assis to write his famous novel Dom Casmurro.M\u00e1rio de Alencar: Machado de Assis' son? ) Alencar died in Rio de Janeiro in 1877, a victim of tuberculosis. A theatre in Fortaleza, the Theatro Jos\u00e9 de Alencar, was named after him. ==Works== ===Novels=== * Cinco Minutos (1856) * A Viuvinha (1857) * O Guarani (1857) * Luc\u00edola (1862) * Diva (1864) * Iracema (1865) * As Minas de Prata (1865 \u2014 1866) * O Ga\u00facho (1870) * A Pata da Gazela (1870) * O Tronco do Ip\u00ea (1871) * A Guerra dos Mascates (1871 \u2014 1873) * Til (1871) * Sonhos d'Ouro (1872) * Alfarr\u00e1bios (1873) * Ubirajara (1874) * O Sertanejo (1875) * Senhora (1875) * Encarna\u00e7\u00e3o (1893 \u2014 posthumous) ===Theatre plays=== * O Cr\u00e9dito (1857) * Verso e Reverso (1857) * O Dem\u00f4nio Familiar (1857) * As Asas de um Anjo (1858) * M\u00e3e (1860) * A Expia\u00e7\u00e3o (1867) * O Jesu\u00edta (1875) ===Chronicles=== * Ao Correr da Pena (1874) ===Autobiography=== * Como e Por Que sou Romancista (1873) ===Critics and polemics=== * Cartas sobre A Confedera\u00e7\u00e3o dos Tamoios (1856) * Cartas Pol\u00edticas de Erasmo (1865 \u2014 1866) * O Sistema Representativo (1866) ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Jos\u00e9 de Alencar's biography at the official site of the Brazilian Academy of Letters * A biography of Alencar at the official site of Messejana Category:1829 births Category:1877 deaths Category:Brazilian male novelists Category:Brazilian lawyers Category:Proslavery activists Category:Brazilian autobiographers Category:Brazilian male dramatists and playwrights Category:People from Fortaleza Category:People from Cear\u00e1 Category:Portuguese-language writers Category:University of S\u00e3o Paulo alumni Category:Writers from Rio de Janeiro (city) Category:19th-century Brazilian dramatists and playwrights Category:Patrons of the Brazilian Academy of Letters Category:19th-century deaths from tuberculosis Category:Brazilian essayists Category:19th-century Brazilian novelists Category:19th-century Brazilian lawyers Category:19th- century Brazilian male writers Category:Tuberculosis deaths in Brazil ",
