    "text": "The Nissan Murano is a mid-size crossover SUV manufactured and marketed by Nissan since May 2002 as a model for 2003, and now in its third generation -- with a convertible variant, the CrossCabriolet, available for the model years of 2011 to 2014. As Nissan's first crossover SUV for the United States and Canada, the Murano was designed at Nissan America in La Jolla, California, and was based on the Nissan FF-L platform shared with the third generation Altima. The single European version of the Murano began sales in 2004. The Murano was Nissan's only crossover SUV in the United States until September 2007, when the 2008 Rogue went on sale. In Canada the X-Trail had been on sale as Nissan's second car based SUV since 2004 as a model for 2005; it was replaced by the 2008 Rogue at the end of 2007. The Murano is sized between the Pathfinder and the now defunct Xterra (replaced by the Rogue as a compact SUV). The nameplate Murano derives from the Italian city of Murano and the namesake Murano art glass for which the city is widely known. == First generation (Z50; 2002)== The first generation Nissan Murano was unveiled in production form for the model year of 2003, at the 2002 New York International Auto Show. It was powered by a 3.5 liter (VQ35DE) V6 producing and , also used in several other Nissan models like the Altima, Maxima, and Nissan 350Z, but specifically tuned for use in the Murano. Available with standard front-wheel- drive (FWD) and optional all-wheel-drive (AWD), the Nissan Murano is one of the largest vehicles using a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Fuel economy was rated at 18 mpg in the city and 23 mpg on the highway (same mpg FWD and AWD on the new EPA specifications). Production started in middle of May 2002, and the first vehicles shipped in early June for the United States, and mid July for Canadian markets. An independent suspension on all wheels was used for class leading ride and handling. Nissan Murano 3.5 (UK) Interior A full set of airbags, steel reinforced cabin, and head restraints were safety features designed to protect the interior while VDC, ABS, electronic brakeforce distribution and brake assist were mechanical safety features. VDC incorporates a form of traction control. The Murano received a crash test rating of five stars in all categories but vehicle rollover (four stars) from the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). For the model year of 2006 in North America, the Murano received some updates in the form of LED tail lamps and turn signals, standard color information screen, available back-up camera (standard in Canada for all models), GPS and a restyled front end with some minor trim updates. September 2004, the Murano was introduced in Japan, replacing the Bassara MPV and exclusive to Nissan Red Stage locations, with a further introduction at Nissan Blue Stage locations in October, replacing the Terrano. Due to the Murano exceeding engine displacement and exterior dimensions as declared in Japanese Government regulations, it was regarded as a luxury vehicle and was equipped with many optional features found in North America as standard equipment on Japanese models, to include Nissan's GPS and internet-based navigation system called CarWings. Japanese models were available with two engine choices, the 3.5L V6 engine, or the 2.5L four cylinder engine. === Murano GT-C === There was also a high-performance version of the first generation of Murano, named as \"GT-C\", which used a high-output version of the VQ35DE engine with a peak power of around 305 bhp, as seen on the 350Z. This enabled the GT-C to set off from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in less than 8 seconds, with a top speed of slightly over 220 km/h. == Second generation (Z51; 2007)== Interior Nissan skipped the model year of 2008 with the introduction of the second generation Murano \u2013 as a model for 2009.
