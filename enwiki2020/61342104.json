It was only in 1822 that he decided to focus on painting instead. That year, he entered the \u00c9cole des Beaux-arts de Paris and remained there until 1825. His primary instructors were Fran\u00e7ois-Louis Dejuinne and Antoine-Jean Gros; both painters of historical and genre scenes. At the same time, he became interested in lithography, a new printing method devised in the 1790s by the actor, Alois Senefelder. In 1826, this interest took him to Spain to work on a catalog of the paintings belonging to King Ferdinand VII at the Royal Palace of Madrid. He eventually contributed eighteen plates for that publication. he remained there for a short time after completing his work before returning to Paris. He established himself as a painter of genre and historical scenes and drew on his experiences in Spain for inspiration. After acquiring a small amount of notoriety, he began to exhibit his works; beginning in 1831. His initial presentation consisted entirely of Spanish-themed works; some in homage to Diego Velasquez. In 1833, he was awarded a prize at the Salon for his \"Brigands of the Kingdom of Valencia\". For many years, works on Spanish subjects would predominate in his oeuvre.
