He then became CEO of RAG AG from 2003, of which Evonik was derived in 2007. His management of a reduction in Germany's dependence on coal in a socially responsible way won him the Manager of the Year award in Germany in 2008. He was chairman of the supervisory board of Deutsche Bahn. == Career == Born in Essen, M\u00fcller attended the in Meppen, completing his Abitur in 1965.

As a politician, M\u00fcller, who belonged to no party, served as Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy from 1998 to 2002, when Gerhard Schr\u00f6der (SPD) was Chancellor. After the 1998 German federal election, Schr\u00f6der made him minister, after the designated candidate, Jost Stollmann had turned down the position because the responsibilities of the ministry were being reduced. When Oskar Lafontaine resigned in 1999, M\u00fcller was also temporarily appointed as the Minister of Finance. M\u00fcller worked towards a first nuclear power phase-out (Ausstieg aus der Atomenergie) in Germany, in negotiations with the industries. M\u00fcller was CEO of the RAG AG, the former Ruhrkohle AG, from 2003. In 2007, the company became Evonik, now with a focus on chemistry, energy and real estate. According to former employer Evonik and German President Horst K\u00f6hler, M\u00fcller managed a reduction in Germany's dependence on coal (Ausstieg aus der Kohleenergie) as an energy source, trying to mitigate the issues caused by this fuel, namely damage to the environment and the large subsidies needed in mining, in a socially responsible way.

M\u00fcller was married; he and his wife Marion had two children. In April 2018, he received the Order of Merit of North Rhine-Westphalia for his life's achievements (f\u00fcr sein Lebenswerk) in the presence of Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. He resigned from all offices in May 2018, due to his cancer illness. He died in Essen on 15 July 2019. == Legacy == In his laudatio for M\u00fcller in 2009, awarding the Great Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, President Horst K\u00f6hler focused on M\u00fcller's ability to speak the language of both politics and economy, and enable dialogue between them. In the matter of nuclear power phase-out, he managed to represent the voters' wishes even though they were not his own view, and he always held constructive discussions with people representing different positions and interests. K\u00f6hler mentioned M\u00fcller's competence, calm manner, equanimity and dependability. In turning away from coal mining, he created a model of a socially responsible structural transition, with patience and tenacity. After his death, Schr\u00f6der acknowledged M\u00fcller as a great economic leader who knew the rules of the game of both business and politics, which enabled him to turn opponents to partners. Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, noted M\u00fcller's enormous expertise, dry humour and calm manner, achieving invaluable benefits for the German miners. Armin Laschet (CDU, Minister-president of North Rhine-Westphalia, called him a visionary, and the founding of the RAG- Stiftung \"a genuine work of the century\" (ein echtes Jahrhundertwerk). == Awards == * 2008: in Germany, by Manager Magazin * 2010: Great Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany * 2013: as CEO of RAG- Stiftung * 2015: Honorary doctorate of the University Duisburg-Essen * 2018: Order of Merit of North Rhine-Westphalia ==References== == External links == * Category:1946 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Commanders Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Category:Economy ministers of Germany Category:Federal government ministers of Germany Category:20th- century German politicians Category:21st-century German politicians Category:Politicians from Essen ",
