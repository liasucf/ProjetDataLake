    "text": "The Martin W. Richard Charitable Foundation is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt charitable foundation that works to advance the values of inclusion, kindness, justice and peace. The Foundation invests in community programs that broaden horizons for young people and encourage them to celebrate diversity and engage in positive civic action. On April 15, 2013, eight-year-old Martin Richard was one of three people killed while hundreds of others were injured when two bombs exploded near the Boston Marathon finish line. A photo of Martin holding a handmade sign spread across the Internet in the weeks that followed; the sign read \u201cNo More Hurting People, Peace.\u201d Martin\u2019s earnest commitment to peace became the impetus for the Martin Richard Foundation, founded by parents Denise and Bill in January 2014. Since 2014, the foundation has raised money through its charity team at the annual Boston Marathon, Chicago Marathon, New York City Marathon, and Falmouth Road Race. Team MR8, named after Martin Richard's initials and his favorite sports number, is composed of volunteer runners, including runners who may not usually qualify to run in the race due to their time scores. The team members raise money for the foundation, which in turn invests in projects such as the Challenger Sports program, its Bridge Builder Campaign, and Martin's Park, an inclusive, climate-resilient space on the Smith Family Waterfront, the first of its kind in Boston and a lasting symbol of Martin Richard\u2019s kind, playful, welcoming spirit. Co-founded with the Boston Bruins Foundation and DMSE Sports, the Foundation's Signature Event is the MR8K, a 5-mile (8K) race open to runners, walkers, para-athletes and families of all ages and abilities. Each year, proceeds and optional fundraising efforts benefit a new community campaign. Martin's Park Martin's Park, which opened in 2019, is located in the Seaport District adjacent to the Boston Children's Museum. Construction began in June 2017, following a $13 million investment from the Martin Richard Foundation. The park overlooks Fort Point Channel and features a children's playground, a performance space, and an upgraded Harborwalk, as well as a garden and water park. == References == Category:Sports foundations based in the United States Category:Non-profit organizations based in Massachusetts https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/09/02/martin-richard-foundation-2nd-annual- road-race https://teammr8.org/ ",
