    "text": "Injury, also known as physical trauma, is damage to the body caused by external force. This may be caused by accidents, falls, hits, weapons, and other causes. Major trauma is injury that has the potential to cause prolonged disability or death. In 2013, 4.8 million people world-wide died from injuries, up from 4.3 million in 1990. More than 30% of these deaths were transport-related injuries. In 2013, 367,000 children under the age of five died from injuries, down from 766,000 in 1990. Injuries are the cause of 9% of all deaths, and are the sixth-leading cause of death in the world. == Classification == Deaths from injuries per million persons in 2012 Deaths from intentional injuries per million persons in 2012 The World Health Organization (WHO) developed the International Classification of External Causes of Injury (ICECI). Under this system, injuries are classified by: * mechanism of injury; * objects/substances producing injury; * place of occurrence; * activity when injured; * the role of human intent; and additional modules. These codes allow the identification of distributions of injuries in specific populations and case identification for more detailed research on causes and preventive efforts.Robertson, LS (2015) Injury Epidemiology: Fourth Edition. Free online at www.nanlee.net The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics developed the Occupational Injury and Illness Classification System (OIICS). Under this system injuries are classified by * nature, * part of body affected, * source and secondary source, and * event or exposure. The OIICS was first published in 1992 and has been updated several times since. The Orchard Sports Injury Classification System (OSICS) is used to classify injuries to enable research into specific sports injuries. === By cause === * Causes for injuries fall under two categories: intentional and accidental. Intentional injuries include acts of violence and war, or be self-imposed like suicide or self-harm. Accidental injuries can come from falling or motor vehicle accidents. Some cases of accidental injuries are injury by stingray or lightning injuries. === By modality === * Trauma ** Traumatic injuries are a body wound or shock produced by sudden physical collision or movement. Injuries associated with trauma are avulsion, bone fracture, injury by blast, internal bleeding and catastrophic injuries. * Strain, repetitive strain, or sprain ** Strain and repetitive strain are injuries to muscles or tendons. Sprain is an injury to a ligament or ligaments. * Toxins ** Injury from toxin or as adverse effect of a pharmaceutical drug. * Other external or internal injuries ** Other injuries can be from external causes, such as radiation, burn or frostbite. These injuries can include radiation-induced lung injury and microwave burn. Injuries from internal causes include reperfusion injury. === By location === Skin: * Wound, an injury in which skin is torn, cut or punctured (an open wound), or where blunt force trauma causes a contusion (a closed wound). In pathology, it specifically refers to a sharp injury which damages the dermis of the skin. Head: * Head injury * Penetrating head injury * Closed head injury Eyes: * Eye injury * Chemical eye injury * Eye injuries during general anaesthesia Brain: * Brain injury * Acquired brain injury * Coup contrecoup injury * Diffuse axonal injury * Frontal lobe injury Nerves: * Nerve injury * Spinal cord injury * Brachial plexus injury * Sciatic nerve injury * Injury of axillary nerve Soft tissue, musculoskeletal and organs: * Soft tissue injury * Tracheobronchial injury * Acute kidney injury * Anterior cruciate ligament injury * Musculoskeletal injury * Articular cartilage injuries * Acute lung injury * Pancreatic injury * Thoracic aorta injury * Biliary injury Body: * Lisfranc injury * Knee injury * Medial knee injuries * Back injury * Hand injury * Chest injury === By activity === * sports ** concussion ** strain ** shoulder injury * rock climbing ** finger injury ** knuckle injury ** Lead climbing injuries * Reverse bite injury * Occupational injury * Ventilator- associated lung injury * Sea urchin injury * Illness and injuries during spaceflight === Injury severity score === The injury severity score (ISS) is a medical score to assess trauma severity. It correlates with mortality, morbidity, and hospitalization time after trauma. It is used to define the term major trauma (polytrauma), recognized when the ISS is greater than 15. The AIS Committee of the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine designed and updates the scale. == See also == * List of causes of death by rate * First aid * direct DNA damage * Ventilator-associated lung injury * Transfusion-related acute lung injury * Asphyxia * Crush injury * Needlestick injury * Penile strangulation == References == == External links == * International Trauma Conferences (registered trauma charity providing trauma education for medical professionals worldwide) * Trauma.org (trauma resources for medical professionals) * Emergency Medicine Research and Perspectives (emergency medicine procedure videos) * American Trauma Society * Scandinavian Journal of Trauma, Resuscitation and Emergency Medicine Category:Medical emergencies Category:Traumatology Category:Causes of death Category:Acute pain Category:Trauma types Category:Adverse childhood experiences ",
