    "text": "Australia vs New Zealand in rugby league is a rivalry between the Australian Kangaroos and the New Zealand Kiwis in the sport of rugby league. The first match between the two sides was in 1908, with New Zealand running out 11\u201310 winners. In 2003 the New Zealand Rugby League recorded the Kiwis' 100th international against Australia. However the Australian Rugby League did not, as they exclude World Cup and Super League Tests from their records. ==Head to Head== {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" | Head to Head |- | Played || 135 |- | wins || 100 |- | wins || 32 |- | Draws || 3 |} ==Results== ===2010s=== {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- ! colspan=\"4\" | 2010s Head to Head |- | Played: 21 ||: 16 ||: 5 || Draws: 0 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- !
