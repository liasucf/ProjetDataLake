He has been a tax inspector between 1972 and 1982. In 1983, he became cultural councillor of the municipality of La Rochelle. In 1985, he became representative in the cabinet of Michel Cr\u00e9peau, then mayor of La Rochelle. In 1986, he became chief of the staff of Michel Cr\u00e9peau. == Political career (1975\u20132012) == === Early period (1975\u20131999) === He has been a member of the Socialist party since 1974. He has been a first deputy mayor of La Rochelle during ten years (1989\u20131999). He was in charge of cultural affairs during this period. From 1993 to 1999, he has been a vice president of the Community of cities of La Rochelle. He was in charge of economics during this period. From 1992 to 1999, he has represented the La Rochelle 6th canton in the General Council of Charente-Maritime. From 1995 to 1999, he has been a president of the municipality-owned company of the public transportation of La Rochelle. === Mayor of La Rochelle (1999\u22122014) and MP (1999\u22122012)=== A mayor of La Rochelle since 1971, an MP of the Charente-Maritime's 1st constituency (1973\u20131993, again from 1997), a former Minister (1981\u20131986) during the first presidential mandate of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, Michel Cr\u00e9peau died in Paris on 30 March 1999, after a heart attack which had arisen few days earlier during a parliamentary session of the National Assembly. In April 1999, Maxime Bono succeeded him as a mayor of La Rochelle, a president of the Community of cities of La Rochelle and an MP of the Charente-Maritime's 1st constituency (the nine cantons of La Rochelle and the two cantons of the \u00cele de R\u00e9). In January 2000, the Community of cities turned into the Agglomeration community of La Rochelle, which currently groups together eighteen towns and villages of Aunis. On 27 April 1999, he resigned as a general councillor of La Rochelle-6 because of the law of the accumulation of mandates (\"Cumul des mandats\"). However, he didn't seek a third parliamentary mandate in 2012. In the National Assembly, he sat as a member in the committee of the sustainable development and spatial planning. Olivier Falorni (Divers Gauche) succeeded him as an MP of the Charente-Maritime's 1st constituency. In 2013, he decided not to seek a further mayoral mandate, hinting at his defeat at the 2012 parliamentary elections as one of the reasons motivating his decision. Following the 2014 French municipal elections, Maxime Bono was succeeded as mayor of La Rochelle and President of the La Rochelle Agglomeration Community by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Fountaine (Divers Gauche). == Elections (2001-2008) == === Municipal elections === In the 2001 municipal elections, Maxime Bono's miscellaneous left list largely overtook the absolute majority from the first round (67.36%, 15,190 votes).
