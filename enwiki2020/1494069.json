    "text": "An author mill is a publisher that relies on producing large numbers of small- run books by different authors, as opposed to a smaller number of works published in larger numbers. The term was coined by Victoria Strauss of Writer Beware, as a parallel formation from diploma mill, an unaccredited college or university that offers degrees without regard to academic achievement, and puppy mill, a breeding operation that produces large numbers of puppies for sale with little regard for breed purity, puppy placement, health, or socialization. Predatory open access publishing is a closely related practice. However, the aims and the business model are rather different: predatory publishers will charge the author up front for publishing in a supposed scientific journal. Since academic evaluation is largely based on publication count or other bibliometrics, even well-meaning authors may be willing to pay to bolster their career prospects. ==Definition== As described by Writer Beware, an author mill is: Victoria Strauss has used the examples of PublishAmerica and VDM Publishing to illustrate the concept of author mill. More precisely, she has characterized VDM as \"an academic author mill\". ==Business model== Typically an author mill does the cheapest possible job of production; it sets high cover prices and prints its books \"on demand.\" The books are listed with on-line booksellers such as amazon.com and bn.com, and on the publisher's website. Any marketing, promotion, or physical bookstore placement is up to the authors themselves. While authors are not \"required\" to buy any of their own books, authors who wish to find readers discover that they need to buy their own books for resale. The rise of the author mill is based on the rise of the on-line bookselling industry and digital printing technology which makes it cheap to print books on demand. The necessary ingredients are: * Minimal editorial gatekeeping * Low production costs (acquiring/editing/designing the book) * Low set-up charges for reproducing the book * The power to set the cover price high enough to make a profit on a small number of average sales * A relatively predictable number of sales to the author, the author's family, and the author's friends. ==See also== *Accreditation mill \u2022 Diploma mill \u2022 Ordination mill \u2022 Contract cheating / Essay mill * Vanity publishing * Nova Publishers * Atlanta Nights * Self- publishing ==References== Category:Publishing ",
