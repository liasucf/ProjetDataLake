    "text": " Intel RealSense Technology is a product range of depth and tracking technologies designed to give machines and devices depth perceptions capabilities. The technology, owned by Intel are used in autonomous drones, robots, AR/VR, smart home devices amongst many others broad market products. The RealSense product is made of Vision Processors, Depth and Tracking Modules, and Depth Cameras, supported by an open source, cross-platform SDK, simplifying supporting cameras for third party software developers, system integrators, ODMs and OEMs. == Technology overview == Intel RealSense Group supports multiple depth and tracking technologies including Coded Light Depth, Stereo Depth and Positional Tracking. === Current Product range === As of January 2018, new Intel RealSense D400 Product Family was launched with the Intel RealSense Vision Processor D4, Intel RealSense Depth Module D400 Series, and 2 ready to use depth cameras: Intel RealSense Depth Cameras D435 and D415. Previous generations of Intel RealSense depth cameras (F200, R200 and SR300) were implemented in multiple laptop and tablet computers by Asus, HP, Dell, Lenovo, and Acer. Additionally, Razer and Creative offered consumer ready standalone webcams with the Intel RealSense camera built into the design.: Razer Stargazer and the Creative BlasterX Senz3D.http://www.pcgamesn.com/creative/creative-senz3d-razer-stargazer == Product series == === Intel RealSense D400 Product Family === ==== Intel RealSense Vision Processor D4 Series ==== The Intel RealSense Vision Processor D4 series are vision processors based on 28 nanometer (nm) process technology to compute real-time stereo depth data. They utilise a depth algorithm that enables more accurate and longer range depth perception than previously available. There are two products in this family: RealSense Vision processor D4 and RealSense Vision Processor D4m. ==== Other products ==== The Intel RealSense Depth Module D400 Series is designed for easy integration to bring 3D into devices and machines. Intel also released the D415 and D435 in 2018. Both cameras feature the RealSense Vision processor D4 and camera sensors. They are supported by the cross-platform and open source Intel RealSense SDK 2.0. The Intel D415 is designed for more precise measurements. ===== Intel RealSense Depth Camera D435 ===== The Intel RealSense Depth Camera D435 is ideal for capturing stereo depth in a variety of applications that help perceive the world in 3D. https://www.cnx-software.com/2017/05/22/399-intel- euclid-realsense-powered-robotics-devkit-runs-ubuntu-ros-on-intel- atom-x7-z8700-processor/http://roscon.ros.org/2016/presentations/ROSCon2016_Intel_RealSense.pdfhttps://fccid.io/2AK6WEUCLID1/RF- Exposure-Info/SAR-Test-Report-1-3339127https://newsroom.intel.com/chip- shots/intel-announces-tools-realsense-technology- development/https://www.patreon.com/posts/intel- euclid-022-12444963https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIGvWYMwLzAhttps://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000024177/emerging- technologies/intel-euclid-development- kit.htmlhttps://www.euclidcommunity.intel.com/https://www.mouser.de/new/Intel/intel- euclid-dev- kit/http://wiki.ros.org/IntelEuclidhttps://imvc.co.il/Portals/38/Amit%20Moran.pdfhttps://github.com/inteleuclidhttps://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/products/99400/emerging- technologies/intel-euclid-development- kit.htmlhttps://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/emerging- technologies/Euclid_User_Guide.pdf == Previous Generations == === Intel RealSense 3D Camera (Front F200) === This is a stand-alone camera that can be attached to a desktop or laptop computer. It is intended to be used for natural gesture-based interaction, face recognition, immersive, video conferencing and collaboration, gaming and learning and 3D scanning. There was also version of this camera to be embedded into laptop computers. === Intel RealSense Snapshot === Snapshot is a camera intended to be built into tablet computers and possibly smartphones. Its intended uses include taking photographs and performing after the fact refocusing, distance measurements, and applying motion photo filters. The refocus feature differs from a plenoptic camera in that RealSense Snapshot takes pictures with large depth of field so that initially the whole picture is in focus and then in software it selectively blurs parts of the image depending on their distance. The Dell Venue 8 7000 Series Android tablet is equipped with this camera. === Intel RealSense 3D Camera (Rear R200) === Rear-mounted camera for Microsoft Surface or a similar tablet, like the HP Spectre X2. This camera is intended for augmented reality applications, content creation, and object scanning. Its depth accuracy is on the order of millimeters and its range is up to 6.0 meters. The R200 is a stereo camera and is able to obtain accurate depth outdoors as well as indoors. === App Challenge === To address the lack of applications built on the RealSense platform and to promote the platform among software developers, in 2014 Intel organized the Intel RealSense App Challenge. The winners were awarded large sums of money. ==Reception== In an early preview article in 2015, PC Worlds Mark Hachman concluded that RealSense is an enabling technology that will be largely defined by the software that will take advantage of its features. He noted that as of the time the article was written, the technology was new and there was no such software. == Product Technical Specifications == Specifications: D4 Series {| class=\"wikitable\" | |D4 Vision Processor |D4M Vision Processor |- |Depth Technology |Stereo |Stereo |- |Form Factor |ASIC BGA |ASIC BGA |- |Package Size |6.4mm x 6.4mm x 1mm |4.7mm x 3.8mm x 0.55mm |- |Process Technology |28 nm |28 nm |- |Depth Max Throughput |36.6 MP/sec (848\u00d7480@90fps) | |- |Depth Stream Output Resolution |Up to 1280\u00d7720 |Up to 720\u00d7720 |- |Depth Stream Output Frame Rate |Up to 90fps | |- |RGB Sensor Max Resolution & Max Frame Rate |1920\u00d71080, Up to 60fps |720\u00d7720, Up to 30 fps |- |IR Projector Controls |Yes |Yes |- |Host Interface |USB 3.0 |2x MIPI |- |Multi Camera Support |Yes, up to 5 |Up to 30fps |- |I/O |5x MIPI CSI-2, 5x I2C, 1x SPI, GPIO, Timer |2x MIPI 1x I2C, 1x SPI, GPIO, Timer |} Specifications: D400 Series {| class=\"wikitable\" | |D400 |D410 |D415 |D420 |D430 |- |Depth technology |Passive IR Stereo |Active IR Stereo |Active IR Stereo |Passive IR Stereo |Active IR Stereo |- |Image Sensor technology |Rolling Shutter |Rolling Shutter |Rolling Shutter |Global Shutter |Global Shutter |- |Depth FOV (HxV for HD 16:9) |63.4degx 40.4deg |63.4degx 40.4deg |63.4degx 40.4deg |85.2degx 58deg |85.2degx 58deg |- |RGB Frame Rate and Resolution |- |- |Up to 60FPS |- |- |- |Depth Resolution |Up to 1280x720 |Up to 1280x720 |Up to 1280x720 |Up to 1280x720 |Up to 1280x720 |- |Depth Frame Rate |Up to 90fps |Up to 90fps |Up to 90fps |Up to 90fps |Up to 90fps |- |Range |0.16-10m+ |0.16-10m+ |0.16-10m+ |0.11-10m+ |0.11-10m+ |} Specifications: D415/D435 {| class=\"wikitable\" | |D415 |D435 |- |Use Environment |Indoor/Outdoor |Indoor/Outdoor |- |Depth Technology |Active infared (IR) stereo |Active IR stereo |- |Image Sensor Technology |Rolling shutter, 1.4umx1.4 um pixel size |Global Shutter, 3 um X 3 um pixel size |- |Components Included |Realsense Vision Processor D4 Realsense Module D410 |Realsense Vision Processor D4 Realsense Module D430 |- |Depth Field of View |63.4deg x 40.4deg (+/-3deg) |85.2deg x 58deg (+/-3deg) |- |Depth Stream Output Resolution |Up to 1280x720 |Up to 1280x720 |- |Depth Stream Output Frame Rate |Up to 90fps |Up to 90fps |- |Minimum Depth Distance (MinZ) |0.16m |0.11m |- |Max Range |~10meters Varies depending on calibration, scene, lighting condition |~10meters Varies depending on calibration, scene, lighting condition |- |RGB Sensor Resolution & Frame Rate |1920x1080 at 30fps |1920x1080 at 30fps |- |RGB Sensor FOV |69.4deg x 42.5deg (+/- 3deg) |69.4deg x 42.5deg (+/- 3deg) |- |Camera Dimension |99mm X 20mm X 23mm |90mm x 25mm x 25 mm |- |Connectors |USB 3.1 Type-C |USB 3.1 Type-C |- |Mounting Mechanism |One 1/4 -20 UNC thread mounting point Two M3 thread mounting points |One 1/4 -20 UNC thread mounting point Two M3 thread mounting points |} == See also == * Creative Labs * Kinect * OpenCV * Project Tango ==References== ==External links== * * Intel RealSense SDK developer documentation Realsense Category:Computing input devices Category:Video game controllers Category:Pointing devices Category:3D imaging Category:Devices capable of speech recognition Category:Infrared imaging Category:Applied machine learning Category:Computer vision software Category:C++ libraries Category:C Sharp libraries ",
