    "text": "Norpethidine (normeperidine, pethidine intermediate B) is a 4-phenylpiperidine derivative that is both a precursor to, and the toxic metabolite of, pethidine (meperidine). It is scheduled by UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. It is a Schedule II Narcotic controlled substance in the United States and has an ACSCN of 9233. The 2014 annual manufacturing quota was . http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/quotas/conv_factor/index.html Norpethidine is a controlled drug because of its potential uses in manufacturing both pethidine itself and a range of N-substituted derivatives, but it has little opioid activity in its own right. Instead, norpethidine acts as a stimulant and causes convulsions.Umans JG, Inturrisi CE. Antinociceptive activity and toxicity of meperidine and normeperidine in mice.

These complications can be serious and have sometimes resulted in death.Jiraki K. Lethal effects of normeperidine. American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology. 1992 Mar;13(1):42-3. Metabolism of pethidine to norpethidine is carried out mainly by the CYP enzymes, CYP2B6, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, in the liver, and since the activity of these enzymes can vary between individuals and can be influenced by concurrent use of other drugs, the rate and extent of norpethidine production can be difficult to predict.Ramirez J, Innocenti F, Schuetz EG, Flockhart DA, Relling MV, Santucci R, Ratain MJ.
