    "text": "Mayoral and municipal elections were held in San Jose, Costa Rica, on 7 February 2016 and were the method by which the citizens of the canton of San Jos\u00e9 elected the mayor, deputy mayors, syndics, aldermen and district councilors of the capital municipality. For the first time the elections of aldermen (traditionally elected at the same time as the president and the deputies) were joined by the other municipal authorities after the 2009 reform to the Municipal Code. This was the fourth time that the Josefinos chose the Mayor of San Jos\u00e9. The winner was former presidential candidate Johnny Araya Monge with more than 40% of the votes, followed by Guido Granados of the National Liberation Party with 16% and the ex-deputy Jorge Eduardo S\u00e1nchez of the Social Christian Unity Party with 10%. ==Candidates== Araya, who was mayor of San Jos\u00e9 since 2002 (and Municipal Executive, the figure that was his equivalent and was not popular election, since 1998) resigned his position to be a presidential candidate for the National Liberation Party in the national elections of 2014, being defeated. Unable to aspire to be candidate on his own party since the Ethics Tribunal suspended him for questioning his conduct during the campaign, Araya registered his candidacy through the cantonal party Alianza por San Jos\u00e9. In other parties the election of the candidate was also controversial. The Cantonal Assembly of the governing Citizens' Action Party elected as candidate alderman Daguer Alberto Hernandez Vasquez, however, his candidacy was not initially ratified by the National Assembly. The nomination was ratified in a second Cantonal Assembly for which the Citizen Action Party finally endorsed it. In the Social Christian Unity Party there were two precandidates: the ex-deputy Jorge Eduardo S\u00e1nchez Sibaja and Douglas Quesada Altamirano (who had previously been a candidate for mayor by the Libertarian Movement), however, Altamirano ran for the Social Christian Republican Party, a splinter of the PUSC founded by dissident Calderonismo and which has the backing of former President Rafael \u00c1ngel Calder\u00f3n Fournier. In the National Liberation Party, Guido Granados, husband of then interim mayor Sandra Garcia, was elected mayoral nominee with 60 votes out of 95 of the Cantonal Assembly in a second vote after obtaining 48 votes in the first count, insufficient to be elected. The remaining votes were obtained by the ex-deputy \u00d3scar Alfaro. The other aspirants the former vice minister Luis \u00c1lvarez and the vice-mayor Gonzalo Ram\u00edrez were out of the second round. Former Ombudsman, deputy and twice presidential candidate (in 2006 by the National Union Party and in 2014 by the National Advance Party) Jos\u00e9 Manuel Echandi Meza ran for the National Integration Party. ==Results== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right !colspan=2|Candidate !Party !Votes !% |- |bgcolor=#00AAE4| ||align=left|Johnny Araya Monge||align=left|San Jos\u00e9 Alliance||23,925||40.01 |- |bgcolor=| ||align=left|Guido Granados Ram\u00edrez||align=left|National Liberation Party||6,610||15.95 |- |bgcolor=| ||align=left|Jorge Eduardo S\u00e1nchez Sibaja||align=left|Social Christian Unity Party||6,322||10.57 |- |bgcolor=| ||align=left|Douglas Quesada Altamirano||align=left|Social Christian Republican Party||3,602||6.2 |- |bgcolor=| ||align=left|Israel Guillen Gonz\u00e1lez||align=left|Broad Front||3,503||5.86 |- |bgcolor=| ||align=left|Jos\u00e9 Manuel Echandi Meza ||align=left|National Integration Party||3,399||5.68 |- |bgcolor=| ||align=left|Daguer Alberto Hernandez Vasquez||align=left|Citizens' Action Party||3,191||5.34 |- |bgcolor=| ||align=left|Vanessa Mayela Calvo Gonz\u00e1lez||align=left|Libertarian Movement||2,051||3.43 |- |bgcolor=orchid| ||align=left|Roberto Arturo Barrantes Guerrero||align=left|Solidarity||1,609||2.69 |- |bgcolor=DodgerBlue| ||align=left|Gustavo Adolfo Ortiz Barrionuevo||align=left|New Generation Party||1,032||1.73 |- |bgcolor=| ||align=left|Marco Antonio Arroyo Jim\u00e9nez||align=left|Costa Rican Renewal Party||786||1.31 |- |bgcolor=orange| ||align=left|Fernando Alexis Castillo Villanueva||align=left|Forces United for Change||523||0.27 |- |bgcolor=darkred| ||align=left|Fernando Alexis Castillo Villanueva||align=left|Worker's Party||313||0.52 |- |align=left colspan=5|Source: TSE |} ==References== Category:San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica Category:2016 elections in Central America Category:Mayoral elections in Costa Rica Category:2016 in Costa Rica ",
