    "text": "Brokers Point or Brokers Nose or Corrimal Peak or Brokers Peak, is a point on the Illawarra Range, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. ==Location and features== With an elevation of approximately above sea level, Brokers Nose, as it is more commonly known as, is located about west of and about south-west of . At its summit there is a television transmission tower. There is a track leading to the top and both track and summit are open to the public; the summit is protected as part of the Illawarra Escarpment State Recreation Area. ==Etymology== The name is vague in its origins and there are three possible explanations for it. One tells that an early settler named Brooker was the origin, the second that poor miners would take their families up to the summit for picnics, and they were brokers (poor people), and the third says that the cliff outcrop resembles the nose of a Jewish person, who are often stereotyped as working as brokers. ==See also== * List of mountains in New South Wales * List of noses ==References== Category:Illawarra escarpment Category:Wollongong Category:Mountains of New South Wales ",
