    "text": "\u00c1ngel Omar Vivas Perdomo is a Venezuelan Brigadier General. He has made himself known as an outspoken opponent of the changes introduced to Venezuela armed forces, by going to the supreme court to challenge the introduction of a war cry originally created by Fidel Castro, as the motto for the military in Venezuela. He was arrested, prosecuted, and on March 1, 2012, sentenced to 4 months and 15 days in jail for having challenged the motto in court. On 7 April, 2017, he was arrested again during a SEBIN operation that tricked him into helping a young man that hit his car into the front door of his house, three years after a detention order was published during the 2014 Venezuelan protests. ==Background== General Vivas was born in San Crist\u00f3bal on October 10, 1956. In 1978 he graduated from the military academy, and in 1988 he graduated as civil engineer. He went on to study \"Planning and Transport Organization\" in London, UK. In 1997 the OAS appointed him commander of the multinational mission MARMINCA in Central America, an operation for mine clearing in the former war-ravaged countries. In 2002 he obtained an MBA in UNET, and in 2006 a doctorate in Business Administration in Finance at the Texan American University. In Venezuela he has held positions such as Finance Director of the Army, and Director of Engineering at the Defense Ministry. He has 35 military decorations from Venezuela, Nicaragua, Honduras, Panama, Costa Rica, Guatemela, and USA. General Vivas is married to Estrella de Vivas; they have 3 daughters. Blogger profile Retrieved 2011-04-05 ==Objection to political use of military== On August 16, 2006, General Vivas was appointed National Director of Engineering at the Defense Ministry, but already on January 24 the following year he decided to hand in his resignation from the post due to \"grave violations of the Venezuelan Constitution\", according to his own declaration. General Vivas's blog Retrieved 2011-04-05 On May 15, 2008, Vivas petitioned the Supreme Court requesting that it eliminate from use in the Venezuela armed forces the motto created by Fidel Castro, \u201cPatria, socialismo o muerte. Venceremos!\u201d (\"Fatherland, socialism or death. We will triumph!\"). He suggested the military could instead use a phrase uttered by Venezuela's liberation hero Francisco Miranda, \"Muera la tiran\u00eda! Viva la libertad!\" (\"Death to tyranny! Long live liberty!\"). The hearings took place July 1, 2008. The petition has been denied. When leaving the court he was arrested by the military intelligence and interrogated for 9 hours. He was later charged with insubordination and some things that are not even specified, plus he was forbidden to speak publicly about the case according to his lawyer, who considers it a clear case of political persecution. In his defense on April 28, 2010, he accused all of his accusers of treason to their oaths of office. The court martial has been postponed repeatedly; the next scheduled date as of writing this is May 3, 2011, 9 AM in Fuerte Tiuna, Caracas. He has been ordered to report every 2 weeks to the authorities, but he has not been forbidden from leaving the country. ==Reactions== The International Crisis Group made reference to General Vivas's court motion and detention while observing that the introduction of the motto in question is a flagrant violation of the apolitical character of the armed forces. International Crisis Group, \"VENEZUELA: \u00bfREFORMA POL\u00cdTICA O COLAPSO DEL R\u00c9GIMEN?\", Informe sobre Am\u00e9rica Latina N\u00b027, p. 3, \"Ch\u00e1vez les dijo a los oficiales que no quisieran suscribir el lema \u201c\u00a1Patria, socialismo o muerte!\u201d que abandonaran la instituci\u00f3n, en un acto de violaci\u00f3n flagrante de su car\u00e1cter apol\u00edtico constitucional18.\" General Vivas has received online support from other militaries in Venezuela and Honduras, although for obvious reasons this support is routinely expressed anonymously. Brigadier general \u00c1ngel Vivas' residence in Caracas The Ministry of Communication and Information is confirming the sequence of events. According to the blog Aporrea (an alternative news and opinion website identified with the Bolivarian Revolution) the motto has been challenged in the Supreme Court before, in 2007. ==Sentence== On March 1, 2012, General Vivas was sentenced to 4 months and 15 days of prison by the military court in Caracas, Venezuela. ==Arrest== On April 7, 2017, General Vivas was arrested again during a SEBIN operation that tricked him into helping a young man that hit his car into the front door of his house, three years after a detention order was published during the 2014 Venezuelan protests. Vivas lost partial sight of his left eye and total audition from his right ear due to the tortures he was subjected to. He was released from El Helicoide on June 1, 2018. ==References== Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Venezuelan generals Category:Prisoners and detainees of Venezuela Category:Venezuelan soldiers Category:Venezuelan prisoners and detainees Category:Venezuelan torture victims ",
