    "text": "Jan Joosten (born 17 May 1959 in Ekeren, Belgium) is an eminent Belgian biblical scholar and convicted sex offender. From 2014 to 2020 he was Regius Professor of Hebrew at the University of Oxford; he was previously Professor of the Old Testament at the University of Strasbourg. In June 2020, he was found guilty of possessing child pornography, and was dismissed from his Chair at Oxford. ==Career== Joosten completed his studies in 1981 in Brussels. His areas of interest are the Septuagint, Syriac versions of the Bible, a biblical manuscript found at Qumran, and the Diatessaron. He was a pastor for six years in Belgium. He was, until June 2020, also a member of the Society of Biblical Literature. He is considered one of the most distinguished biblical scholars of his generation. As of Friday 3 July 2020 Joosten was no longer employed by Oxford University nor was he a trustee of Christ Church College, and he was no longer affiliated in any way with the institution. Joosten was president of the International Organization for Septuagint and Cognate Studies. ==Child pornography conviction== On June 18, 2020, Joosten was sentenced by the Saverne (he lives in the Bas-Rhin region) criminal court to one year in prison and placed on the sex offender registry in France for holding 27,000 images and one thousand videos of child pornography, including images of children being raped. Joosten admitted to offences dating from 2014 to May 2020 after being exposed by Strasbourg LION (laboratoire d\u2019investigation op\u00e9rationnelle du num\u00e9rique) as part of a lengthy investigation.https://www.dna.fr/faits- divers-justice/2020/06/19/un-professeur-d-universite-juge-pour-detention-d- images-pedopornographiques Joosten downloaded the images over a six year period. He was 'relieved to be arrested'. He described his addiction to pornographic images and videos of children as a \"secret garden\" that contradicted who he is as a person. On his conviction, he was not immediately incarcerated. His sentence would be supervised, and he would have to complete a three-year programme of treatment. He was prohibited from any activity bringing him into contact with minors. Joosten has four children. R\u00e9mi Gounelle, the Dean of the Facult\u00e9 de th\u00e9ologie protestante de Strasbourg, released this statement following Joosten's arrest: \u201cNous sommes tous tomb\u00e9s de haut. Il n\u2019y avait aucune suspicion de ce genre, aucun probl\u00e8me avec les \u00e9tudiants. C\u2019est une affaire moralement tr\u00e8s choquante mais qui ne remet pas en cause les grandes comp\u00e9tences p\u00e9dagogiques et scientifiques de Jan Joosten. C\u2019est surtout profond\u00e9ment triste. Jan est tomb\u00e9 dans une forme d\u2019addiction dont il n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 sortir. Il luttait contre ses pulsions n\u00e9gatives sans parvenir \u00e0 y \u00e9chapper. Cela nous montre la complexit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00eatre humain. Jan est un coll\u00e8gue tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 et il vivait avec \u00e7a. Cela rend humble de d\u00e9couvrir cette addiction, cette fragilit\u00e9.\u201d Gounelle argued that, whilst the unmasking of Joosten as a paedophile was deeply shocking, it does not call into question his pedagogical and scientific skills. Joosten still holds a role at the University of Strasbourg. In a public statement that noted his \"shocking crimes and... the suffering endured by those in the images he accessed,\" Oxford University announced Joosten's removal from employment. == Works == * \"The Syriac Language of the Peshitta and Old Syriac Versions of Matthew.
