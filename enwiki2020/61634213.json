He tested positive for erythropoietin (EPO), a banned blood booster, at the 2019 Copenhagen Half Marathon. Though he initially disputed the results, he later admitted to the violation and received a four-year ban from the sport. This occurred during a period where World Athletics had highlighted Ethiopia as a country at risk of widespread doping, which was followed by the launch of an education programme by the Ethiopian Athletics Federation.Gillen, Nancy (2020-03-20).
