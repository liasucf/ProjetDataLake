    "text": "Gonzalo (also Consalvo, latizined Gundisalvus) is a Spanish masculine given name. The name is given for Galician Saint Gonzalo (d. c. 1108/12), bishop of Mondo\u00f1edo from 1071. It derives from a Gothic name with the first element gun\u00fei- (\"battle\"). The second element is uncertain, the latinization Gundisalvus may be based on a folk etymological interpretation based on Latin salvus. Suggestions include gun\u00fei-saiwala- (as it were \"battle-soul\") and gun\u00feis-albs (\"battle-elf\"). ==Given name== People with the name include: ===Medieval=== *Saint Gonzalo (Gonzalo Froilaz, d. c. 1112), bishop of Mondo\u00f1edo-Ferrol *Gonzalo Ruiz or Rodr\u00edguez, feudal lord of La Bureba (or Burueba) throughout much of the mid-twelfth century *Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n (d. 1231), Castillian noble *Gonzalo de Berceo (d. 1264), Castillian poet *Gonzalo P\u00e9rez (d. c. 1451), Valencian painter ===Early Modern=== *Gonzalo de Alvarado (born 15th/16th century), brother of Don Pedro *Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (1453\u20131515), known as el Gran Capit\u00e1n, Castilian general and statesman *Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (1585\u20131635), Spanish military leader *Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\u00e9s (1478\u20131557), Castilian writer and historian *Gonzalo Pizarro (1502\u20131548), Spanish conquistador *Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada, Spanish explorer and conquistador in northern South America *Gonzalo Garc\u00eda Zorro, Spanish conquistador who participated in the Spanish conquest of the Muisca people *Gonzalo Mac\u00edas, Spanish conquistador who participated in the expedition from Santa Marta into the Muisca Confederation *Gonzalo M\u00e9ndez de Can\u00e7o (1554\u20131622), Spanish Admiral and the seventh Governor of Florida (1596\u20131603) *Gonzalo Su\u00e1rez Rend\u00f3n, Spanish conquistador, known as the founder of Boyac\u00e1 and Tunja * ===Modern=== *Gonzalo Ab\u00e1n (born 1987), Argentine footballer *Gonzalo Aguirre Beltr\u00e1n (1908\u20131996), Mexican anthropologist *Gonzalo Arango (1931\u20131975), Colombian poet/novelist and founder of Nadaism *Gonzalo Arconada, Spanish football manager *Gonzalo Barroilhet (born 1986), Chilean decathlete *Gonzalo Castro Rand\u00f3n, German footballer of Spanish origin *Gonzalo \"Chory\" Castro Iriz\u00e1bal, Uruguayan footballer *Gonzalo Colsa (born 1977), Spanish footballer *Gonzalo C\u00f3rdova (1863\u20131928), Ecuadorian president *Gonzalo Curiel (composer) (1904\u20131958), Mexican film composer *Gonzalo de la Torre (born 1977), Mexican-American singer-songwriter, director and producer *Gonzalo Escobar, Ecuadorian tennis player *Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez (Uruguayan politician), Foreign Minister of Uruguay since 2008 *Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez-Casta\u00f1o (born 1980), Spanish golfer *Gonzalo Garcia (basketball) (born 1967), Argentine basketball coach *Gonzalo Garcia (dancer) (born 1979/1980), New York City Ballet principal dancer *Gonzalo Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda (born 1983), Spanish footballer *Gonzalo Garc\u00eda N\u00fa\u00f1ez (born 1947), Peruvian economist/politician *Gonzalo Higua\u00edn (born 1987), Argentine-French footballer *Gonzalo Javier Rodr\u00edguez (born 1984), Argentine footballer *Gonzalo Jara, Chilean professional footballer *Gonzalo Longo (born 1974), Argentine rugby union player *Gonzalo M\u00e1rquez (1946\u20131984), Venezuelan-American baseball player *Gonzalo Miranda (born 1979), Chilean track and road cyclist *Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de la Mora, Spanish essayist and politician *Gonzalo P.
