Pending developments of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in the cancellation of the previous year\u2019s tournament, the 82nd edition of the tournament is scheduled to begin on March 16, 2021, and will conclude with the championship game on April 5 at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana. ==Tournament procedure== Pending any changes to the current format, a total of 68 teams will enter the 2021 tournament. 32 automatic bids shall be awarded to each program that wins their conference's tournament. The remaining 36 bids are \"at-large\", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee. Eight teams (the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams) will play in the First Four (the successor to what had been popularly known as \"play-in games\" through the 2010 tournament).
