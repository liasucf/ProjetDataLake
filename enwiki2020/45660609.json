    "text": "Melainabacteria is a phylum related to Cyanobacteria. Organisms belonging to this phylum have been found in the human gut and various aquatic habitats such as groundwater. By analyzing genomes of Melainabacteria, predictions are possible about the cell structure and metabolic abilities. The bacterial cell is similar to cyanobacteria in being surrounded by two membranes. It differs from cyanobacteria in its ability to move by flagella (like gram-negative flagella), though some members (e.g. Gastranaerophilales) lack flagella.Soo RM, Woodcroft BJ, Parks DH, Tyson GW, Hugenholtz P. (2015) Back from the dead; the curious tale of the predatory cyanobacterium Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus. PeerJ 3:e968 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.968 Melainabacteria are not able to perform photosynthesis, but obtain energy by fermentation. The genomes of Melainabacteria organisms isolated from ground water indicate that the organism has the capacity to fix nitrogen. Melainabacteria lack linked electron transport chains but have multiple methods to generate a membrane potential which can then produce ATP via ATP synthase. They are able to use Fe hydrogenases for production that can be consumed by other microorganisms. Melainabacteria from the human gut also synthesize several B and K vitamins, which suggests that these bacteria are beneficial to their host because they are consumed along with plant fibers. ==Classification== Melainabacteria contains the following taxa: * Candidatus Caenarcaniphilales (order) ** Ca. Caenarcanum (genus) *** Ca. Caenarcanum bioreactoricola (species) * Ca. Gastranaerophilales (suborder) ** Ca. Gastranaerophilus (unranked) *** Ca. Gastranaerophilus phascolarctosicola (species) * Ca. Obscuribacterales (order) ** Ca. Obscuribacter (genus) *** Ca. Obscuribacter phosphatis (species) * Vampirovibrio (genus) ** Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus (species) ==External links== * What Are Cyanobacteria And What Are Its Types? * Overview of cyanobacteria * Webserver for Cyanobacteria Research * CyanoBase ==References== Category:Environmental chemistry Category:Bacteria phyla Category:Taxa described in 2013 Category:Candidatus taxa ",
