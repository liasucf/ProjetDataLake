    "text": "Dramarama was a British children's anthology series broadcast on ITV between 1983 and 1989. The series tended to feature single dramas with a science fiction, supernatural and occasionally satirical theme. It was created by Anna Home, then head of children's and youth programming at TVS; however, the dramas themselves were produced by a total of twelve ITV regional companies. Thus, each episode was in practice a one-off production with its own cast and crew, up to and including the executive producer. Dramarama was largely a showcase for new talent to television and offered debuts for Anthony Horowitz, Paul Abbott, Kay Mellor, Janice Hally, Tony Kearney, David Tennant and Ann Marie Di Mambro. It was also one of Dennis Spooner's last works. One of the stories, Thames' Dodger, Bonzo And The Rest from 1984, proved so popular that it was spun off into its own series and Christmas special the following year - the series starred Lee Ross and recounted life in a large foster home. Another story, Granada's Blackbird Singing in the Dead of Night from 1988, was developed into the long-running series Children's Ward. The original Dramarama story was co-written by Paul Abbott and Kay Mellor - at the time, working as staff writers for Granada. The series has rarely been repeated in recent years, although two episodes - Blackbird Singing in the Dead of Night and Back to Front - were broadcast on the CITV Channel as part of a 30th anniversary weekend in January 2013. ==Episodes== ===Dramarama: Spooky (1982)=== #War Games With Caroline #The Exorcism of Amy #The Danny Roberts Show #The Ghostly Earl #In a Dark, Dark Box... #The Restless Ghost #The Keeper ===Series one (1983)=== #Mighty Mum And The Petnappers (TVS) #Rip It Up (TVS) #Venchie (Tyne Tees) #Jack And The Computer (TVS) #Because I Say So (Central) #Bully For Cosmo (Central) #Messages (Tyne Tees) #The Young Person's Guide To Getting Their Ball Back (TVS) #Sweet Revenge (Central) #The Restless Ghost (Thames) ===Series two (1984)=== #Night Of The Narrow Boats (Central) #Fowl Pest (TVS) #Dodger, Bonzo And The Rest (Thames) #Que Sera (TVS) #Stalemate (Central) #Snoop!

TVS produced the greatest number of episodes. ==Home media== A videotape containing the episodes \"Big T for Trouble\", \"Just Wild About Harry\" and \"Venchie\" (all Tyne Tees productions) was released by Video Gems, c. 1990. It is now out of print. All episodes produced by Thames Television have been released on DVD by Network, who have also released the 1983 series Spooky which was shown under the Dramarama banner. The home video rights to the remaining episodes are held by ITV Studios, aside from those produced by Scottish, TVS and the one episode produced by TSW. The TVS episodes cannot be released commercially but some have appeared on YouTube, and STV itself placed all its episodes on YouTube in 2010, but has since removed them. ==References== ==External links== * (STV Player) * * * * Category:English-language television shows Category:1980s British children's television series Category:1983 British television series debuts Category:1989 British television series endings Category:British anthology television series Category:ITV children's television shows Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:Television series by Fremantle (company) Category:Television series by Yorkshire Television Category:Television shows produced by Border Television Category:Television shows produced by Central Independent Television Category:Television shows produced by Granada Television Category:Television shows produced by Harlech Television (HTV) Category:Television shows produced by Scottish Television Category:Television shows produced by Television South (TVS) Category:Television shows produced by Television South West (TSW) Category:Television shows produced by Thames Television Category:Television shows produced by Tyne Tees Television Category:British fantasy television series Category:British science fiction television shows Category:Television shows produced by Ulster Television ",
