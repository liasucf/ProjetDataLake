    "text": "The Phoebe Needles Mission School (1902-1943) was a noted Mission school operated by the Episcopal Diocese of Southwestern Virginia in Franklin County, Virginia, near the town of Callaway, Virginia, in the Blue Ridge Mountains. At the turn of the twentieth century, the Episcopal Church (United States) wanted to increase mission outreach to isolated communities within the Commonwealth. At Phoebe Needles, the Episcopal church established a small mission church, St Peter's-on-the-Mountains, and a school. The school provided free education to rural and mountain areas where the students could not go to the public schools. The Rev. William T. Roberts organized both the Episcopal mission at Phoebe Needles, as well as St. John-of-the-Mountain in Endicott, Virginia. Latitude: 36.967359 Longitude: -80.095595 Geographic Name Information System GNIS ID: 1494484 ==Mission School== The school site was selected because at that time the state school system had no method of public transport. There was a need for a school in the area with few roads and little transport, and the school system could not afford to operate another school outside of the local one in Callaway, about four miles away. The school building was constructed in 1907 along with a small wooden church,Emmanuel Church. Commencing with the first semester, Miss Caryetta \"Etta\" Davis took charge of the school as the missionary-in-charge. She would serve for over 30 years at the school. Originally it had forty students, and quarters were also constructed for the teachers on site. In 1913, a terrible snow storm destroyed both the school and the church. A new facility was built between 1915 and 1917, that was built of stone from local quarries. This construction was almost entirely financed by Arthur C. Needles, who was at the time president of the Norfolk and Western Railroad, in honor of his daughter, Phoebe. Phoebe Needles had recently died at the age of six due to meningitis. The school provided for students in grades one through seven. Originally devised for mountain girls, it was later opened to both boys and girls.Salmon, John S. and Emily J. Salmon. 1993. Franklin County, Virginia, 1786-1986: A Bicentennial History. Franklin County Bicentennial Commission. Page 380. The only daughter of Arthur and Bessie Needles, Phoebe Augusta Needles (1906-1913), died at the age of 6 from meningitis. \"He became interested through an Episcopal minister to underprivileged children in Franklin County, Virginia, and established there the St. Phoebe's Mission, in honor of his daughter, who died as a child. For the last sixteen years of his life he virtually supported the mission, although he was himself of the Quaker faith.\"\"A.C. Needles, Head of N&W.;, Dies after 53 Years of Service.\" Richmond Times-Dispatch. October 26, 1936. \"Caryetta Davis (known as Miss Etta), the daughter of an Episcopal priest, taught at the school for thirty years. Miss Etta was widely known and respected throughout the community. There were many other teachers who are well remembered for their substantial contributions to the people of this community: Agatha Saunders, Mamie Montgomery, M. Baker, Susie Saunders, Mary Saunders, Louisa Wood, Betty Clenearly, Nell Strayer Roberts, Alberta Booth, Octavia Ulma and Agatha Walker Pennybacker.\"\"How Things Came to Be...\" St Peters-in-the-Mountain.

She had at least one child of one of her students named after her. \"Etta Helm was named for Etta Davis, who a teacher at the Phoebe Needles Mission School. Etta is not a traditional Helms name.\"Helms, Samuel King Helms. Gateway Press. 1985. The Helm Family of Virginia, Volume 2. Page 1007. From the original forty students, the school grew to have an average of between 100 and 150 students per semester. \"This school was founded in 1906 by the Rev. W. T. Roberts and endowed by A. C Needles, then president of the Norfolk and Western Railway. It is known as the Phoebe Needles Memorial School. The average enrollment is from 100 to 150.

It was one of many mission schools in the county at the time, and the only one left that is still in operation. The Phoebe Needles Center is no longer a mission school, of course, but the center will be a beehive of activity and learning for youth this summer as annual camps get under way.Boothe, Charles. \u201cThe Phoebe Needles Center\u201d, Franklin News-Post.

It was named in memory of his 6-year-old daughter who died from meningitis.

Puppetry, he explained, has its roots in religion. It was used in the past to relate Bible stories to those who were illiterate or didn't have access to the printed text. \"In a way, puppetry is going back to its original role,\" Tucker said, referring to the subject of the upcoming workshop.Wray, Lindsay.
