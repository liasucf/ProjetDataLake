At the age of 6, he began piano lessons in Tashkent with Tamara Popovich and then with Lev Naumov at the Moscow Conservatory. At the age of thirteen he was a participant of the International Radio Competition for Young Musicians in Prague. He became famous after winning the Eighth Van Cliburn International Piano Competition on June 11, 1989, at the age of 19, the youngest contestant in that year's competition. Listeners were awed by his virtuosic technique, musicality, and dynamic range. After winning the Van Cliburn, he made appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and Late Night with David Letterman. In October 1995, Sultanov won second prize at the International Frederic Chopin Piano Competition but he refused to accept it ; the grand prize was not awarded. He became an American citizen in 2004. ==Strokes and death== In 1996 he had his first stroke, and despite his refusal was convinced by his wife Dace Abele to visit Ed Kramer, a neurologist. Kramer checked on him and discovered some small black spots which proved to him that blood clots had formed in the brain. Despite the stroke he continued his performance in Tokyo, but there he suffered another stroke. After that the same neurologist diagnosed him with diastolic heart failure. In February 2001, he had another stroke. The strokes damaged everything except the cerebral cortex and he was able to continue performing88 notes pour piano solo, Jean- Pierre Thiollet, Neva Editions, 2015, p. 153 et 155. while sitting in a wheelchair.
