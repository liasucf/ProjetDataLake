    "text": "\"Hungry Child\" is a song by British synth-pop band Hot Chip. It is the fifth track on their seventh studio album, A Bath Full of Ecstasy, and was released as its lead single on 4 April 2019 through Domino Recording Company. == Background == The single \"Hungry Child\" coincided with the announcement of their seventh studio album, A Bath Full of Ecstasy which was announced to be released on 21 June 2019. The song features Valentina Pappalardo on vocals . == Style == The song has been described a mixture of alternative dance, house music, and disco. Jessica Mao, writing for Dancing Astronaut said that \"Hungry Child\" \"[meshes] indie with electronic in a dreamy, yet groovy number, emitting heavy summer vibes.\" == Music video == A corresponding music video was released the same day of the track's release. The music video was recorded in the Fall of 2018, and was written and directed by Saman Kesh. Nicholas Weisnet served as the cinematographer. The two actors starring in the music video are Party Down's Martin Starr and Milana Vayntrub. Starr and Vayntrub play a couple sharing passive conversation before their lives become inundated with the song. == Critical reception == Critical reception of the track has generally been positive by contemporary music critics. In a positive review, Philip Sherburne, writing for Pitchfork, called \"Hungry Child\" a \"dance-music aficionado's record par excellence, a collage of hallowed tropes: moody Reese bass, flashing piano stabs, gospel-house vocal harmonies, even squirrelly little synth riffs reminiscent of Isol\u00e9e\". Sherburne further explaining that the lyrics \"meets the band's muscular four-to-the-floor throb, creating a sound that's as playful as it is lovelorn\". Writing for Noisey, Josh Terry called the song an \"excellent single\", describing it as \"sprawling and pulsing\". Billboard included \"Hungry Child\" on its list of the 32 best dance songs in the first half of 2019. == Track listing == == Personnel == ;Music video The following individuals were credited for the creation of the music video. * Saman Kesh \u2014 Writer, Director * Ellis Bahl \u2014 Co-writer * Luga Podesta \u2014 Executive Producer * Sarah Park \u2014 Producer * Nicholas Weisnet \u2014 Cinematographer * Paola Ezarun \u2014 Wardrobe * Jessica Garrison \u2014 Production Design * London Alley \u2014 Production Company == References == == External links == * * Category:2019 singles Category:2019 songs Category:Hot Chip songs Category:Domino Recording Company singles ",
