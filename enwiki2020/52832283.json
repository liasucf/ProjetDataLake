    "text": "Marcos Anthony Moreno (born September 27, 1994) is a public health advocate and medical research scholar. He is of mixed ancestry but is recognized as a Native American who is a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe from the Pascua Yaqui Reservation in southern Arizona just outside of Tucson. In May 2017, Marcos graduated with honors from Cornell University, receiving a Bachelor's of Science degree in Neuroscience, and a minor in American Indian Studies. He is the first person from the Pascua Yaqui Reservation to graduate from an Ivy League University. While at Cornell Marcos spent time working as a researcher in the cognitive development laboratory of Dr. Gary Evans, and Dr. Alexander Ophir's Brain and Behavior laboratory. In addition to research at Cornell University, Marcos spent time as a researcher at the University of Arizona, where he worked in the neuro-pharmacology laboratory of Dr. Todd Vanderah, publishing a study on Neurokinin Receptor -1 (NK\u2081R) antagonists and Substance-P (SP) implications in neurological addiction reward pathways. Marcos Moreno with fellow Udall Scholar Victor Lopez-Carmen Outside of work in research, Marcos has been involved with public health work with his tribe and abroad. In 2013, Marcos was a part of the St. John's University founding chapter of the Global Medical Brigades that began taking trips to west Africa to administer medical care to rural villages. In 2014 Marcos was a part of a public health project on the Pascua Yaqui Reservation aimed at assessing the Pascua Yaqui Tribe's health department, in addition to improving standards of care and standards of living on the tribe's reservation. In 2016, Marcos was awarded the Morris K. Udall Award that recognizes undergraduate scholars in the United States for their work in the fields of Environmental Activism, Public Policy, or Healthcare. In 2017 Marcos received the Henry Ricciuti Award recognizing his outstanding \"distinction in research, excellence in leadership, and to exceptional community and public service\". Also in 2017, Marcos received the Solomon Cook Award for Engaged Research and Scholarship, an honor awarded to one Cornell undergraduate per year. In the fall of 2016, the Cornell Daily Sun reported that Marcos was inducted as a member of the 125th tapping class of Quill and Dagger, one of the oldest secret societies in the Ivy League. With membership now being too difficult to conceal, the names of all newly tapped Quill and Dagger members are published in Cornell's newspaper, however there is still much speculation as to what the privileges and benefits of these 'secret' organizations actually entail, as much of their practices remain unknown.
