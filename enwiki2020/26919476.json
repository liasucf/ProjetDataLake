Kahn received his Ph.D. from The Ohio State University in 1979 after completing his dissertation under his advisor Dijen K. Ray-Chaudhuri. In 1980 he showed the importance of the bundle theorem for ovoidal M\u00f6bius planes.Inversive planes satisfying the bundle theorem, Journal Combinatorial Theory, Serie A, Vol.29, 1980, p. 1-19 In 1993, together with Gil Kalai, he disproved Borsuk's conjecture.. In 1996 he was awarded the P\u00f3lya Prize (SIAM). In 2004, with David Galvin. He was an invited speaker at the 1994 International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich. In 2012, he was awarded the Fulkerson Prize (jointly with Anders Johansson and Van H. Vu) for determining the threshold of edge density above which a random graph can be covered by disjoint copies of a given smaller graph. Also in 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2013-01-27. ==References== Category:Living people Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:21st-century American mathematicians Category:Combinatorialists Category:Rutgers University faculty Category:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
