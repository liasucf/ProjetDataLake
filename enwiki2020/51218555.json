    "text": "The Magyar Sziget festival (Hungarian Island) is a nationalist festival organised in the Hungarian city of Ver\u0151ce, by the Sixty-Four Counties Youth Movement (HVIM) under leadership of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Toroczkai. In 2015 the location was changed to Velence. The name itself is an example of the feeling of isolation of Hungary. It can be seen as a metaphor for the 'island' of Hungary within a sea of non-Finno-Ugric languages. The festival is not to be confused with the 'normal' Hungarian Sziget festival. == Organisation == Although the festival is organised by a nationalist and irredential movement, it does not solely feature nationalist bands. 'Normal' Hungarian (rock)bands are booked for the festival as well, and cultural demonstrations are part of the program. In 2001 Toroczkai started the festival as a summer camp for his youth movement. At that point the name was still 'Grand National Youth Meeting'. The next year, this name would be changed to Magyar Sziget. Reinforcing the national identity amongst participants was one of the goals of the festival, and thus the inspiration for the new name. Although the festival started off as a week-long event, it has since been shortened to just two days in more recent years. Magyar Sziget changes every year, but the Hungarian bands and cultural activities that support Hungarian heritage remain the main focus. In recent years the festival was downsized, but alternative festivals have been organised as well. The organisers have set up an 'Uplands Hungarian Island' (Felvid\u00e9ki Magyar Sziget) festival in Slovakia in some years.Felvid\u00e9ki Magyar Sziget (Hungarian) There is a Sz\u00e9kely Sziget (in Romania) and a summer camp for children, Nemzeti Gyerekt\u00e1bor ('National Childrenscamp') as well.Felvid\u00e9ki Magyar Sziget (Hungarian)Nemzeti Gyerekt\u00e1bor, Facebook (Hungarian) Organiser Toroczkai has referred to the 'normal' Sziget festival in Budapest as an \"anti-Hungarian event\".
