    "text": "Richard Altmann (12 March 1852 - 8 December 1900) was a German pathologist and histologist from Deutsch Eylau in the Province of Prussia. Altmann studied medicine in Greifswald, K\u00f6nigsberg, Marburg, and Giessen, obtaining a doctorate at the University of Giessen in 1877. He then worked as a prosector at Leipzig, and in 1887 became an anatomy professor (extraordinary). He died in Hubertusburg in 1900 from a nervous disorder. He improved fixation methods, for instance, his solution of potassium dichromate and osmium tetroxide.William Bechtel, Discovering Cell Mechanisms: The Creation of Modern Cell Biology (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2009), pp 80\u201383. Using that along with a new staining technique of applying acid-fuchsin contrasted by picric acid amid delicate heating, he observed filaments in the nearly all cell types, developed from granules.Erik Nordenski\u00f6ld, The History of Biology (New York: Knopf, 1935), pp 538\u201339. He named the granules \"bioblasts\", and explained them as the elementary living units, having metabolic and genetic autonomy, in his 1890 book \"Die Elementarorganismen\" (\"The Elementary Organism\").Richard Altmann, Die Elementarorganismen und ihre Beziehungen zu den Zellen [The cellular organelles and their relations to cells], (Leipzig, Germany: Veit & Co., 1890), p. 125. From p. 125: \"Da auch sonst mancherlei Umst\u00e4nde daf\u00fcr sprechen, dass Mikroorganismen und Granula einander gleichwerthig sind und Elementarorganismen vorstellen, welche sich \u00fcberall finden, wo lebendige Kr\u00e4fte ausgel\u00f6st werden, so wollen wir sie mit dem gemeinschaftlichen Namen der Bioblasten bezeichnen.\" (Since in other ways as well various circumstances indicate that micro\u00f6rganisms and granula are equivalent to each other and represent elementary organisms, which are found wherever living forces are initiated, then we will designate them with the common name of \"bioblasts\".) Available on-line at: Deutsches Textarchiv, Berlin His explanation drew much skepticism and harsh criticism.Edmund B Wilson, The Cell in Development and Inheritance, 2nd edn (New York: Macmillan Co, 1900), pp 289\u201391. Altmann's granules are now believed to be mitochondria.\"Altmann's granules\", Merriam\u2013Webster, Accessed online: 30 Aug 2013.Jan Sapp, \"Mitochondria and their host\", in W F Martin & M M\u00fcller, eds, Origin of Mitochondria and Hydrogenosomes (Heidelberg: Springer, 2007), pp 57\u201359. He is credited with coining the term \"nucleic acid\" in 1889, replacing Friedrich Miescher's term \"nuclein\" when it was demonstrated that nuclein was acidic. == Books == * \u00dcber Nucleins\u00e4uren.
