    "text": "Lithodes maja, the Norway king crab, is a species of king crab which occurs in colder North Atlantic waters off Europe and North America. It is found along the entire coast of Norway, including Svalbard, ranging south into the North Sea and Kattegat, the northern half of the British Isles (with a few records off southwest England), and around the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and off south- eastern Greenland. In the West Atlantic, it ranges from the Davis Strait between Greenland and Canada south to The Carolinas in the United States. The carapace is almost circular and may reach a width of up to . The whole body is brown or orange and is covered with large spikes. It lives on both soft and hard bottoms, at depths of . Like most king crabs, females are asymmetrical, with the left side of the abdomen considerably larger than the right, although specimens with the reverse of this are occasionally found. The low rate of egg production by this species, in comparison to species fished in the North Pacific, limits its abundance, making it unsuitable for commercial exploitation. According to their physiological adaptations capabilities, the ideal larval developmental temperatures was thought to between 1\u00b0C-15\u00b0C, however, from experiment they discovered the optimal temperature is 6\u00b0C instead. In addition, according to Anger K on the temperature and larval development testing, the complete larval development takes 7 weeks at a constant temperature at 9\u00b0C. ==References== Anger, K. \u201cPhysiological and Biochemical Changes during Lecithotrophic Larval Development and Early Juvenile Growth in the Northern Stone Crab, Lithodes Maja (Decapoda: Anomura).\u201d SpringerLink, Springer-Verlag, 13 Jan. 1996, link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00347453. ==External links== * Category:King crabs Category:Crustaceans of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Crustaceans described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ",
