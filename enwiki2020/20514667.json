    "text": "Andrew Lewis Taylor (born 20 January 1966) is a British multi-instrumentalist musician, born and raised in Barnet, North London, England, in the late 1960s. He started in the music business as a guitarist touring with the psychedelic rock band Edgar Broughton Band. In 1986 he began performing as Sheriff Jack, releasing two albums of psychedelia music, Laugh Yourself Awake (1986) and What Lovely Melodies! (1987). As Lewis Taylor, he released his self-titled album in 1996, through Island Records, with tracks including \"Bittersweet\" and \"Lucky\" being released as singles. The album showcased a significant departure from psychedelia towards neo soul and was highly acclaimed. However, Lewis Taylor became \"an album that everybody talked about but few bought\". Taylor released his album Stoned, Part I in 2002 on his own label named Slow Reality, and followed it up in 2004 with a sequel, Stoned, Part II. Robbie Williams covered \"Lovelight\" from Stoned, Part 1 on his 2006 album, Rudebox. In June 2006, Lewis Taylor retired from music. As Andrew Taylor, he had since been musical director and bass player for Gnarls Barkley, and guitarist/backing vocalist for the Edgar Broughton Band and The Drivers. In 2016, Caroline Records re-issued his debut album on CD with a bonus disc comprising the b-sides, Lucky remixes and extended version of \"Bittersweet\". ==Discography== Studio Albums *Lewis Taylor (1996) *Lewis II (2000) *Stoned, Part I (2002) *Stoned, Part II (2004) *The Lost Album (2004) Compilations *Limited Edition 2002 (2002) *Limited Edition 2004 (2004) Singles/EPs *1996 : \"Lucky\" *1996 : \"Whoever\" *1997 : \"Bittersweet\" *1997 : \"Lucky\" (reissue) *1997 : \"Lucky\" (Kruder & Dorfmeister Mixes) *1997 : \"Bittersweet\" (12\") *1997 : \"Bittersweet\" (Lucas's Mixes 12\") *2004 : Reconsider - The 'Stoned Part II' EP (12\") *2005 : In Session 2005 (digital only release) *2005 : Stoned Instrumentals (CDr, Promo, EP) *2006 : Stoned Live (Hacktone 3-track promo-only EP) *2006 : Hide Your Heart Away (CD, EP, Promo) Soundtracks and miscellaneous appearances *1998 : Mojo soundtrack (tracks Crazy Crazy Momma, \"Don't Make Me Wait\", both credited as Little Lewis) *1998 : Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels soundtrack (track \"18 With A Bullet\") duet with Carleen Anderson *1998 : Lullabies With a Difference (track \"Cherry Blossom\") *1999 : Ophelie Winter - Privacy (tracks Move On, \"Lovin' You More\") *2000 : Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) soundtrack (track \"Blue Eyes\") *2004 : The Trip Created By Tom Middleton (track \"Lovelight\") *2006 : Live At The World Cafe Volume 22: Catch 22 (track \"Stoned Pt. 1\") *2010 : The Last Holiday soundtrack (track \"Back Together\") *2011 : Deborah Bond - Madam Palindrome (track \"If I Didn't Need You\") duet with Deborah Bond *2012 : The Vicar - Songbook #1 (tracks \"The Girl With the Sunshine in Her Eyes\" and \"That Boy's Not Cool\") ==References== Category:English composers Category:English multi-instrumentalists Category:Living people Category:1960s births Category:Musicians from London Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Neo soul singers ",
