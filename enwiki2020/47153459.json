    "text": "Temax Municipality (In the Yucatec Maya Language: \u201cplace of monkeys\u201d) is one of the 106 municipalities in the Mexican state of Yucat\u00e1n containing of land and located roughly northeast of the city of M\u00e9rida. ==History== It is unknown which chieftainship the area was under prior to the arrival of the Spanish. After the conquest the area became part of the encomienda system. The encomienda was established for the minor children of Juan de Sosa in 1549. In 1579 it passed to Juan de Sosa Vel\u00e1zquez and in 1607 three-quarters passed to Bernardo de Sosa Vel\u00e1zquez and one-quarter passed to Pedro de Sosa. In 1639 Juan de Villa Real was the encomendero and by 1688 Ana Dorantes possessed the trust. Yucat\u00e1n declared its independence from the Spanish Crown in 1821 and in 1825, the area was assigned to the coastal region with its headquarters in Izamal Municipality. It was designated as its own municipality by 1922. Temax, though now a sleepy town, in the recent past its history had witnessed a disturbed and fascinating period on account of momentous caste wars during the middle of the nineteenth century. Situated as it is between the henequen area and the poorly inhabited inland region and the \"settled plantations society\" there were rebellions to stop land encroachments by the plantation community. In this context, Temax played a central role in creating an environment of insurgency led by Pedro Crespo, their powerful and aggressive political leader. The state authorities of Yucat\u00e1n played a diplomatic role in recognizing the influence of Crespo and brokered peace with him by delegating autonomous power to Temax. ==Governance== The municipal president is elected for a three-year term. The town council has seven councilpersons, who serve as Secretary and councilors of public services, public safety, ecology, nomenclature, markets and roads.

The Police Commissioners ensure public order and safety. They are tasked with enforcing regulations, distributing materials and administering rulings of general compliance issued by the council. ==Communities== The head of the municipality is Temax, Yucat\u00e1n.
