Recognized for its high quality, it also provided instruction and training in needlework for young women. In 1903, W\u00e6ver enhanced her wares by acquiring the studio where Constantin Hansen's daughters, Kristiane Konstantin-Hansen and Johanne Bindesb\u00f8ll, had worked, including all its artworks, models and designs. In 1917, she transferred ownership of the business which then became known as Eva Rosenstand Clara W\u00e6ver. It survives today in the centre of Copenhagen as Eva Rosenstand. ==Biography== Cross-stitch patterns by Clara W\u00e6ver Born in Stubbek\u00f8bing on the island of Falster on 7 April 1855, Clara W\u00e6ver was the daughter of Christian Pedersen W\u00e6ver (1821\u20131905), a skipper, and his wife Hanne Elizabeth Fester (1827\u20131913). The family name stemmed from her great-grandfather who was a weaver. In 1875, her father retired from the sea and moved to Copenhagen with his wife and his two daughters (Clara and Augusta). Clara W\u00e6ver took up needlework, taught in a girls school and worked in S.B. Wiegand's embroidery shop. In 1890, she opened a retail needlework business on Vesterbrogade together with her younger sister who had just qualified as a teacher at N. Zahle's School. The business prospered, attracting customers from both the city and the countryside. By the end of the 19th century, it had gained a reputation for its high quality workmanship, in contrast to most of the other textile businesses in the city which were often associated with shoddy goods. Augusta ran the retail business while Clara became one of the city's few experts who were able to teach young women the art of needlework. At the time, it was important for fine young women to learn how to sow as when they married, they were expected to provide napkins, table cloths, bed linnen, shirts and handkerchiefs, all with embroidered rims and the family initials. Alternatively, the bride's parents could order embroidered articles from the W\u00e6vers' shop. As a result, in addition to those working in the shop, they employed a number of women who worked from home. The W\u00e6vers undertook all kinds of needlework but they were particularly adept at cross-stitch work. Many of their patterns were inspired by designs developed by Kristiane Konstantin-Hansen and Johanne Bindesb\u00f8ll for their own needlework business on the basis of artwork created by the master painters of the Danish Golden Age. When they sold the business in 1903, Clara W\u00e6ver bought most of the designs and patterns which became part of her own developments. She also drew on the work of Kristian M\u00f8hl, Knud V. Engelhardt and Margrete Drejer. Her business began to supply embroidered goods to churches throughout the country, especially altar cloths and carpets. In 1903, the business moved into new premises, also on Vesterbrogade. In the face of difficulties in obtaining materials during the First World War, in 1917 Clara W\u00e6ver sold the business to N.C. Dyrlund. W\u00e6ver died in Hellerup on 18 August 1930 and was buried in Vestre Cemetery. ==References== Category:1855 births Category:1930 deaths Category:People from Guldborgsund Municipality Category:19th-century Danish artists Category:Danish company founders Category:Danish women artists Category:Danish textile artists Category:Danish embroiderers Category:Danish women in business Category:19th-century women textile artists Category:19th- century textile artists Category:19th-century Danish businesspeople ",
