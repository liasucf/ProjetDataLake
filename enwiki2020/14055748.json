    "text": "Getting to the Point is the second studio album by the British blues rock band Savoy Brown. It marks the debut of a vastly different lineup, still led by Kim Simmonds but fronted by new vocalist Chris Youlden. It was released by Decca in 1968 with catalog number SKL 4935 and finds the group taking on more of the songwriting load, as opposed to their debut, which consisted mostly of covers. One of the covers is \"You Need Love\" by Willie Dixon, which served as a blueprint for \"Whole Lotta Love\" by Led Zeppelin. Deram released the cd with three bonus tracks in 1990 with catalog number 820 922-2. ==Track listing== # \"Flood in Houston\" (Kim Simmonds, Chris Youlden) \u2013 4:00 # \"Stay with Me Baby\" (Dave Peverett, Simmonds, Youlden) \u2013 2:35 # \"Honey Bee\" (Muddy Waters) \u2013 6:25 # \"The Incredible Gnome Meets Jaxman\" (Simmonds) \u2013 3:30 # \"Give Me a Penny\" (Traditional arr.
