    "text": "John Inderwick was a tobacco pipe maker and property developer. He founded a tobacconist shop in Wardour Street in 1797. This continued as Inderwick & Co for many years, being located at number 45 in Carnaby Street when that street became fashionable in the Swinging Sixties. He introduced the Meerschaum pipe to London and bought a mine in Crimea to supply sepiolite for these. Having become prosperous, he invested in property development in Kensington which was built up during the 18th century. He developed a substantial estate of six and half acres which became known as Kensington New Town and then followed this with a similar scheme at Kensington Gate. At the time of his death in 1867, he also owned properties in Haverstock Hill, Camden Town, Woolwich and the West End of London. ==References== Category: Home builders Category: Pipe makers Category: Tobacconists ",
