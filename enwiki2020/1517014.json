J. O'Rourke has indirectly suggested a brown ribbon campaign to fight diarrhea: > \"Political means could be used to prevent almost all deaths from childhood > diarrhea. Diarrhea is spread by contaminated water. Public sanitation is, > like personal security, national defense, and rule of law, one of the few > valid reasons for politics to exist. Lowly, semicomic diarrhea kills > 2,866,000 people a year worldwide, 2,474,000 of them children under the age > of five. This is ten times the number of people who die from AIDS. But no > one is wearing a brown ribbon on his tuxedo lapel at the Academy Awards or > marching up the Mall in Washington carrying a sign reading DIARRHEA -- IT > CAN BE CONTAINED.\"P.J. O'Rourke - All the Trouble in the World (1994) Brown ribbons are worn in South Africa in protest against farm attacks.
