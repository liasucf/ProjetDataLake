    "text": "The gate of Camp Bagong Diwa Camp Bagong Diwa () is the headquarters of the National Capital Region Police Office. Located in Lower Bicutan, Taguig, Philippines, the camp serves many functions: within its gates are enclosed a police academy and the Taguig City Jail, but also several jail \"annexes\" which house inmates the government believes to be too notorious or too dangerous to be safely housed among the regular population. As of December 2018, the camp contains the Manila City Jail Annex, the Quezon City Jail Annex, and the Metro Manila District Jail Annexes 1, 2, and 3. The camp also contains the highest security prisons in the Philippines, the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology's Special Intensive Care Area (SICA) 1 and SICA 2. As of 2018, within SICA 1 and 2 were housed accused terrorists of the Moro National Liberation Front, Abu Sayyaf, and Maute groups along with accused communist rebels from the New People's Army (Communist Party of the Philippines). As a general rule, for security reasons, the jails within Camp Bagong Diwa tend to be much less overcrowded than the jails outside; SICA 1 in April 2018 was only 25% overcrowded. However, this is not always the case; Camp Bagong Diwa also contains the Bureau of Immigration Bicutan Detention Center, which as of April 2020, is 278% overcrowded, with a capacity of 150 but a population of 418. == References == Category:Law enforcement in the Philippines Category:Philippine National Police Category:Buildings and structures in Taguig Category:Prisons in the Philippines ",
