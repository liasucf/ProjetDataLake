    "text": "Adriana Benetti (12 December 1919 \u2013 24 February 2016) was an Italian actress. ==Biography== Born in Quacchio, a town east of Ferrara, Benetti graduated from the Istituto Magistrale and then landed in Rome, where she was accepted at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia. While there, she was discovered by Vittorio De Sica and subsequently made her debut at age 22 in his 1941 film Teresa Venerd\u00ec as the title character. In 1942, she appeared in director Alessandro Blasetti's celebrated Quattro passi fra le nuvole, where she supported Gino Cervi in Luigi Zampa's C'\u00e8 sempre un ma!, and Avanti c'\u00e8 posto..., alongside Andrea Checchi and Aldo Fabrizi. In 1943, she played in Mario Soldati's Quartieri alti with Massimo Serato and Vittorio Sanipoli and in Marc All\u00e9gret's Les Petites du quai aux fleurs with Bernard Blier and G\u00e9rard Philipe. In 1945, she appeared in two musicals, Torna a Sorrento with Gino Bechi and O sole mio with opera singer Tito Gobbi. In 1946, she appeared with Fosco Giachetti in Il sole di Montecassino and with Eduardo and Titina De Filippo in Uno tra la folla. In 1947, she appeared in Goffredo Alessandrini's Furia, alongside Rossano Brazzi, in Giorgio Ferroni's Tombolo, paradiso nero with Lucio De Caro and in Man\u00f9 il contrabbandiere with Andr\u00e9 Cayatte. That same year, she scandalized Italy by posing in a bikini for the weekly newspaper Tempo illustrato.http://museovirtualedeldiscoedellospettacolo.blogspot.co.uk/2016/02/la- morte-di-adriana-benetti-diva.html?spref=tw In 1950, she acted with Tot\u00f2 in 47 morto che parla. She specialised in ing\u00e9nue roles and was known as \"fidanzatina d'Italia\" (Italy's little fianc\u00e9e), a term coined for her by Assia Noris. Because of this, as she aged, her film appearances became less frequent. She played a teacher in 1955's Eighteen Year Olds (a remake of Schoolgirl Diary) and an older woman in 1957's A vent'anni \u00e8 sempre festa, after which she retired from cinema. == Filmography == *Teresa Venerd\u00ec, directed by Vittorio De Sica (1941) *C'\u00e8 sempre un ma!, directed by Luigi Zampa (1942) * Before the Postman, directed by Mario Bonnard (1942) *Quattro passi fra le nuvole, directed by Alessandro Blasetti (1942) *Gente dell'aria, directed by Esodo Pratelli (1942) *I quattro di Bir El Gobi, directed by Giuseppe Orioli (1942) * In High Places, directed by Mario Soldati (1943) *Rondini in volo, directed by Luigi Capuano (1943) *Tempesta sul golfo, directed by Gennaro Righelli (1943) *O sole mio, directed by Giacomo Gentilomo (1945) *Il sole di Montecassino, directed by Giuseppe Maria Scotese (1945) *Torna a Sorrento, directed by Carlo Ludovico Bragaglia (1945) *Inqueitudine, directed by Vittorio Carpignano and Emilio Cordero (1946) *Uno tra la folla, directed by Ennio Cerlesi (1946) * Fury, directed by Goffredo Alessandrini (1947) *Tombolo, paradiso nero, directed by Giorgio Ferroni (1947) *Man\u00f9 il contrabbandiere, directed by Lucio De Caro (1947) * Night Arrival, directed by J.A.
