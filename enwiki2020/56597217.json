    "text": "Sextus Hermentidius Campanus was a Roman senator, who was active during the Flavian dynasty. He was suffect consul in the nundinium of July to August 97 as the colleague of Lucius Domitius Apollinaris.Ladislav Vidman (ed.), Fasti ostienses, second edition (Praha: Academia, 1982), pp. 45, 91 He is known entirely from inscriptions. His gentilicum \"Hermentidius\", derived from the god Hermes, suggests that Campanus' origins lie in Cappadocia, where there is evidence of a number of names incorporating the name of that deity.Edward Dabrowa, Legio X Fretensis: A Prosopographical Study of its Officers (I-III c. A.D.) (Stuttgart: Franz Steiner, 1993), pp. 33f In any case, he is the only member of his family known to have acceded to the consulate. The only office Campanus is known to have held, other than his consulate, is legatus or commander of the Legio X Fretensis between the years 93 and 97, which was stationed during those years in Jerusalem. Command of this legion also made Campanus the de facto governor of Judea. Edward Champlin has restored his name in the Testamentum Dasumii, which would attest that Campanus was alive at least as late as the year 108.Edward Champlin, \"Miscellanea Testamentaria\", Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 62 (1986), pp. 251-253 == References == Category:1st-century Romans Category:2nd-century Romans Category:1st-century Roman governors of Judea Category:Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Category:Roman governors of Judea Category:2nd-century deaths ",
