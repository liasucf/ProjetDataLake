    "text": "A magnetogravity wave is a type of plasma wave. A magnetogravity wave is an acoustic gravity wave which is associated with fluctuations in the background magnetic field. In this context, gravity wave refers to a classical fluid wave, and is completely unrelated to the relativistic gravitational wave. ==Examples == Magnetogravity waves are found in the corona of the Sun. ==See also== * Wave * Plasma ==References== Category:Astrophysics Category:Plasma physics Category:Waves ",
