    "text": "Blurt is an English post-punk band, founded in 1979 in Stroud, Gloucestershire. == Background == Blurt was founded in 1979 in Stroud, Gloucestershire by poet, saxophonist and puppeteer Ted Milton along with Milton's brother Jake, formerly of psychedelic group Quintessence, on drums and Peter Creese on guitar. After three albums Creese left the band to be replaced by Herman Martin on synthesizers who, after a year of constant touring left the band, and was replaced by Steve Eagles, former member of Satan's Rats, The Photos and Bang Bang Machine. Shortly thereafter Jake Milton left to be replaced by Nic Murcott, who was subsequently replaced by Paul Wigens. Eagles was replaced by Chris Vine as guitarist from 1990 to 1994, and returned to the band following Vine's departure. Wigens was briefly replaced by Charles Hayward between May and October 2001 before returning to the band, before departing the band for good in 2005. His replacement was Bob Leith (of Cardiacs), who stayed with the band until 2008, at which time he was replaced by the band's current drummer Dave Aylward. Most of Blurt's compositions feature simple, repetitive, minimalistic guitar and/or saxophone phrases, but they can also explore more abstract musical territories, often serving as an atmospheric backdrop for Ted Milton's existentialist poetry. ==Personnel== ;Current members *Ted Milton \u2013 saxophone (1979\u2013present) *Steve Eagles \u2013 guitar (1987\u20131990, 1994\u2013present) *Dave Aylward \u2013 drums (2008\u2013present) ;Former members *Jake Milton \u2013 drums (1979\u20131988) *Peter Creese \u2013 guitar (1979\u20131986) *Herman Martin \u2013 synthesiser (1986\u20131987) *Nic Murcott \u2013 drums (1988) *Paul Wigens \u2013 drums (1988\u20132001, 2001\u20132005) *Chris Vine \u2013 guitar (1990\u20131994) *Charles Hayward \u2013 drums (2001) *Bob Leith \u2013 drums (2005\u20132008) == Discography == ; Studio albums * Blurt (1982) * Friday the 12th (1985) * Poppycock (1986) * Smoke Time (1987) * Kenny Rogers' Greatest Hit (Take 2) (1989) * The Kenny Rogers Greatest Hit (1991) * Pagan Strings (1992) * Celebrating the Bespoke Cell of Little Ease (1998) * Cut It!
