    "text": "Mauro Prosperi (born 1955, Rome) is an Italian police officer and modern pentathlete who became famous after becoming lost in the Sahara Desert during an endurance event in 1994. Prosperi, a keen endurance runner, took part in the 1994 Marathon des Sables (Marathon of the Sands) in Morocco. Part way through the six-day 233 kilometre event a sandstorm caused Mauro Prosperi to lose his way. He ended up disoriented and ran in the wrong direction, ultimately running several hundred kilometres into Algeria. After 24 hours he ran out of food and water. He arrived at an abandoned Muslim shrine, with the corpse of a holy man in it, and survived by drinking his own urine. He found bats on the low ceilings which he decapitated and then ate the guts and drank the blood from, and he waited for rescue. A helicopter and a plane passed, but they failed to see him.Run 151 miles in the desert? No sweat The Times, 13 April 2008, retrieved on 5 December 2010 Not wishing to die a long drawn out death, Prosperi attempted to commit suicide in the shrine by slitting his wrists with a pen knife he had with him. The attempt failed \u2013 lack of water had caused Prosperi's blood to thicken and ultimately clotted the wound. He then regained his composure, and followed a Tuareg's advice prior to the start of the race to set his compass in the direction of early morning clouds and walk towards them. He walked in the desert and ate reptiles, insects, and cacti from dried wadis, before stumbling on an oasis, with a footprint next to it, and then some goats, and then a little girl who ran away towards a tent with women in it who gave him goat's milk and laid him in the shade outside. After nine days alone in the desert, he was found and taken to an Algerian military camp and from there to a hospital. He was off route, and had lost in body weight.Running on empty MSN travel, retrieved on 5 December 2010 He received a hero's welcome back home in Italy, and media clamour. His survival story has since been depicted on the National Geographic Channel in a documentary titled Expeditions To The Edge: Sahara Nightmare, and within Episode 5 Lost in the Desert, of the 2019 Netflix series Losers. In 2014, British adventurer and survival instructor Bear Grylls also drew influence from Prosperi\u2019s survival in the Sahara Desert, within an episode of his six part Discovery Channel series Bear Grylls : Escape from Hell. Prosperi\u2019s story of endurance was also broadcast in a promotional campaign by 20th Century Studios in December of 2015, in support of the American drama film The Revenant, released the same year. In May 2020, Prosperi published his book, written in the Italian language, alongside his former wife and co-author Cinzia Pagliara, entitled \u201cQuei 10 Giorni Oltre la Vita\u201d (Those 10 Days Beyond Life). Prosperi later entered the race again in 1998, but was halted by a stubbed toe.Marathon Des Sables SI Adventures, SI.com, retrieved on 5 December 2010 Prosperi then re-entered the race yet again in 2012, completing the race in 34 and a half hours, in 131st place. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Italian police officers Category:Italian male modern pentathletes Category:1955 births ",
