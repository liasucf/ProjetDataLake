He traveled to Rome at a young age, where he remained until his death. His paintings belong to the group of artists known as the Bamboccianti, or, as Houbraken writes, Bamboots, which is a specialization by Northern artists in small-scale genre scenes in the manner of Pieter van Laer while in Rome.Slive, pp. 233\u2013237. Helmbreker arrived in Italy in 1654, eventually settling in Rome by the end of the decade. At the end of the 1670s he and the Flemish painter Willem Reuter were members of a group known as the 'Congregazione dei Virtuosi al Pantheon'.Biographical details of Willem Reuter at the National Gallery of Art The Congregazione counted among its members many important artists who left their mark in Rome.

His genre scenes, which were among the last generation of the Bamboccianti, tended to be more classical in inspiration than many their earlier low-life scenes.Laureati Ultimately, these works found great success with Italian collectors. In 1695 he was commissioned to paint the main altar piece of the Church of St. Julian of the Flemings in Rome. Houbraken described a painting from 1681 in the possession of Pieter Klok showing an Italian monastery with a group of poor people in the foreground with various handicaps being given soup from a large kettle ladled by a Franciscan friar. Helmbreker was very religious and donated often to the poor of Rome. ==References== ==External links== *Dirck Helmbreeker on Artnet * Entries for Dirck Helmbreker at Christie's ==Bibliography== *Laura Laureati, \"Helmbreker [Elembrech; Helmbreecker], Dirck [Teodoro; Theodoor; Theodor],\" Grove Art Online.
