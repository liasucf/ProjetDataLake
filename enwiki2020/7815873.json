    "text": "Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Colimon-Hall (n\u00e9e Colimon, April 11,1918 \u2013 April 1997), was a Haitian writer. Born in Port-au-Prince, Colimon began her writing career as a playwright and published five plays between 1949 and 1960. In 1974 she published her first and most well-known novel, Fils de Mis\u00e8re. She also wrote essays, short stories, and children's literature. Colimon's keen observations of the Haitian people's struggle against poverty gave a particularly poignancy to her work, as demonstrated by Fils de Mis\u00e8re. In Les Chants des sirenes, her collection of short stories, she explored the painful impact of the Haitian diaspora on both the individuals in exile and the Haitian community. She was one of the initial members of the Feminine League for Social Action. == Recording from the Library of Congress == Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Colimon Hall reading from her own work (1980). ==References== * * Category:1918 births Category:1997 deaths Category:Haitian women novelists Category:People from Port-au-Prince Category:Haitian women dramatists and playwrights Category:20th-century women writers Category:20th-century Haitian novelists Category:20th-century Haitian dramatists and playwrights ",
