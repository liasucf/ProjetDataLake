    "text": "The women's individual archery event is one of 5 archery events scheduled to be held at the 2020 Summer Olympics. It is planned to be held at Yumenoshima Park. It would be the 13th consecutive appearance of the event, which has been held every Games since archery returned to the Olympic program in 1972. == Qualification == 64 archers qualify for the women's archery events. The 12 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) that qualify for the women's team event (including the host, Japan) enter the 3 team members in the individual event as well. Otherwise, NOCs may qualify a maximum of 1 archer in women's individual. There are quota spots available at various tournaments, including the World Championships, multiple continental events, and a final qualification tournament. There are also two Tripartite Commission invitational spots. ==Competition format== As with the other archery events, the women's individual is a recurve archery event, held under the World Archery-approved 70-meter distance and rules. Competition begins with a ranking round, in which each archer shoots 72 arrows. The scores from the ranking round are used to seed the archers into a single-elimination bracket. The knockout matches use the set system introduced in 2012. Each match consists of up to 5 sets of 3 arrows per archer. The archer with the best score in each set wins the set, earning 2 points. If the score is tied, each archer receives 1 point. The first archer to score 6 points wins the match. If the match is tied 5-5 after 5 sets, a single tie-breaker arrow is to be used with the closest to center winning. == Records == Prior to the competition, the world and Olympic records were as follows. *72 arrow ranking round ==Results== ===Ranking round=== ===Competition bracket=== ====Section 1==== ====Section 2==== ====Section 3==== ====Section 4==== ====Finals==== ==References== Category:Archery at the 2020 Summer Olympics ",
