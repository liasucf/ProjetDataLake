His main focus was portraiture and the exploration of historical themes, in particular the figure of the reclining odalisques.https://www.montefioredellaso.com/domenicocantatore ==Biography== Domenico Cantatore was born in Ruvo di Puglia in Apulia. He was the younger of eight siblings. In 1922 he moved to Rome, and from there in 1924 to Milan, where he began to paint. In Milan he befriended the art critic Raffaele Carrieri and collector Margherita Sarfatti. In 1929 he had his first solo show at Galleria Milano, where his work was praised by Carlo Carr\u00e0. In 1932, Cantatore moved to Paris, where he befriended Henri Matisse and Amedeo Modigliani. The next year, Edoardo Persico helped him organising an exhibition, mostly made of drawings, at the Brera Academy. In 1934 he had a solo presentation at Galleria del Milione. In 1935 Cantatore moved back to Milan, where for a few years he expanded his practice to writing. In 1966 he published his first novel, Ritorno al paese. (Back to the Country) His long friendship with Salvatore Quasimodo resulted in Quasimodo writing a catalogue essay for Cantatore's exhibition at Galleria d'Arte Corocchia in Milan. He also joined the Novecento Italiano movement together with Giuseppe Migneco, Aligi Sassu, and Bruno Cassinari, although he was somewhat resistant to embrace the group's politics.https://www.montefioredellaso.com/domenicocantatore In 1940, he was appointed Professor of Figure Drawing at the Liceo artistico in Milan.
