The name Izmis means \"caves\" in Kohistani, and as the lake is surrounded by several natural caves, the people have named the lake after these caves. A small jeep-able link road from Utror leads towards the location of the lake, which ends in a valley called Loypanrghalay. The lake can be accessed from here after trekking for almost 3\u20136 hours. Category:Lakes of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Category:Swabi District ",
