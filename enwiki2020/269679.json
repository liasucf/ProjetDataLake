When he was about eighteen, he was sent to Italy with his brother Fran\u00e7ois, abb\u00e9 Tallemant. On his return to Paris, Tallemant took his degrees in civil law and Canon law, and his father obtained for him the position of conseiller au parlement. Disliking his profession, he decided to seek an alternative income by marriage with his cousin Elisabeth de Rambouillet. His half-brother had married a d'Angennes, and this connection secured for Tallemant an introduction to the H\u00f4tel de Rambouillet. Madame de Rambouillet was no admirer of King Louis XIII, and she gratified Tallemant's curiosity with stories of the reigns of Henry IV and Louis XIII that were of real historical value. The society of the H\u00f4tel de Rambouillet opened a field for his acute and somewhat malicious observation. In the Historiettes he gives finished portraits of Vincent Voiture, Jean Louis Guez de Balzac, Malherbe, Jean Chapelain, Valentin Conrart and many others; Blaise Pascal and Jean de la Fontaine appear in his work; and he chronicles the scandals of which Ninon de l'Enclos and Ang\u00e9lique Paulet were centres. The Historiettes are invaluable for the literary history of the time. It has been said that the malicious intention of Tallemant's work may be partly attributed to his bourgeois extraction and that the slights he received are avenged in his pages, but independent testimony has established the substantial correctness of his statements. In 1685 he converted to Catholicism. It seems that the change was not entirely disinterested, for Tallemant, who had suffered considerable pecuniary losses, soon after received a pension of 2,000 livres. He died in Paris. ==Works== Des R\u00e9aux was a poet and contributed to the Guirlande de Julie, but it is by his Historiettes that he is remembered. The work remained in manuscript until it was edited in 1834-6 by MM. de Ch\u00e2teaugiron, Jules Taschereau and Louis Monmerqu\u00e9, with a notice on Tallemant by Monmerqu\u00e9. A third edition (6 vols. 1872) contains a notice by Paulin Paris. Tallemant had begun M\u00e9moires pour la r\u00e9gence d'Anne d'Autriche, but the manuscript has not been found. ==References== * ==External links== * * * Historiettes (in 17th century French) Category:1619 births Category:1692 deaths Category:People from La Rochelle Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Calvinism Category:French Roman Catholics Category:French biographers Category:French poets Category:17th-century French writers Category:17th-century male writers Category:French male poets Category:French male non-fiction writers ",
