    "text": "Cole Deggs & the Lonesome is the only album by American country music band Cole Deggs & the Lonesome. It was released on July 10, 2007 via Columbia Records. The album includes the singles \"I Got More\" and \"Girl Next Door\". ==Critical reception== Giving it three-and-a-half stars out of five, Thom Jurek of Allmusic said that it was \"a promising first set by a band with a unique sound; they can sing, write, arrange, and play the hell out of their instruments while being uniquely themselves.\" Jeffrey B. Remz of Country Standard Time was less favorable, calling the band's harmonies \"workmanlike\" and the songwriting \"predictable\". He thought that the song \"I Haven't Stopped Hurtin'\" was the best song on the album because the band \"cut loose\" on it. == Track listing == #\"Girl Next Door\" (Cole Deggs, Mike Geiger, Trey Matthews) \u2013 3:38 #\"I Got More\" (Jim Collins, Rivers Rutherford) \u2013 3:29 #\"Out of Alabama\" (Angelo Petraglia, Dave Berg, Hillary Lindsey) \u2013 3:03 #\"Twelve Ounces Deep\" (Matthews, Tony Ramey) \u2013 4:18 #\"The One That Got Away\" (Berg, Rutherford) \u2013 3:41 #\"Huggin' This Blacktop\" (Deggs, Matthews) \u2013 3:45 #\"Makin' Nothing Out of Something\" (Deggs, Matthews, Geiger) \u2013 3:41 #\"Do You Ever Think About Me\" (Chris Lindsey, Aimee Mayo, Anders Osborne) \u2013 4:52 #\"Everybody's Beautiful to Someone\" (Rutherford, Tom Shapiro) \u2013 3:51 #\"A Girl Like You\" (Deggs, Jimmy Wallace) \u2013 3:59 #\"I Haven't Stopped Hurtin'\" (Phil O'Donnell, Ronnie Rogers) \u2013 3:35 ==Personnel== ===Cole Deggs & The Lonesome=== *Cole Deggs \u2013 lead vocals, acoustic guitar *Shade Deggs \u2013 bass guitar, background vocals *Brian Hayes \u2013 drums *David Wallace \u2013 electric guitar, background vocals *Jimmy Wallace \u2013 keyboards, Hammond organ, background vocals ===Additional musicians=== *Matt Chamberlain \u2013 drums *Lisa Cochran \u2013 background vocals *Perry Coleman \u2013 background vocals *Eric Darken \u2013 percussion *Kenny Greenberg \u2013 electric guitar *Mark Hill \u2013 bass guitar *Jim Hoke \u2013 harmonica *Tim Lauer \u2013 accordion *Chuck Leavell \u2013 piano, Wurlitzer electric piano, Hammond organ *Russ Pahl \u2013 acoustic guitar, electric guitar, steel guitar *Kim Parent \u2013 background vocals *Rivers Rutherford \u2013 acoustic guitar, background vocals *John Wesley Ryles \u2013 background vocals *Russell Terrell \u2013 background vocals * John Willis \u2014 acoustic guitar, banjo *Christian Wojcik - background vocals ==Singles== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Single ! colspan=\"1\"| Peak positions |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! width=\"60\"| US Country |- | 2007 ! scope=\"row\"| \"I Got More\" | 25 |- | 2008 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Girl Next Door\" | 49 |- |} ==References== Category:2007 debut albums Category:Columbia Records albums Category:Cole Deggs & the Lonesome albums Category:Albums produced by Mark Wright (record producer) ",
