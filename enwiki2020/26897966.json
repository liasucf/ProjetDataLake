    "text": "Roque Balduque (or Roque de Balduque) (died February 1561) was a sculptor and maker of altarpieces. Born at an unknown date in Bois-le-Duc (now 's-Hertogenbosch, capital of North Brabant in the Netherlands), he is known for his work in Spain in the last years of his life.A. Moreno Mendoza, E. Pareja L\u00f3pez, M.J. Sanz Serrano, and E. Valdivieso, Museo de Bellas Artes de Sevilla, Ed. Galve, Seville 1993. . Chiclana (province of C\u00e1diz, Spain. ==Life== Balduque was married to a woman known as Isabel de Balduq; with a son, they settled in Seville in 1534. He is documented in 1554 as a carver and sculptor (\"entallador e imaxinero\") who has brought new Italian and Flemish concepts to Seville. His presumed relatives Juan Mateo, Pedro, Diego, and Andr\u00e9s Bolduque had a sculptural studio on Medina de Rioseco (province of Valladolid), where they executed various projects for churches in and around Valladolid and Palencia. Beginning in December 1554, Balduque began an important series of sculptures and altarpieces for parish churches in Seville, which accommodated two kinds of Marian images, ranging in style from Nordic primitivism to Flemish Mannerism. In Seville, he settled in the working-class neighborhood of La Magdalena. After his death in February 1561, his widow entrusted his uncompleted projects to the Flemish sculptor Juan Giralte. ==Known and attributed works== Balduque collaborated on the main altarpiece of the Cathedral of Seville and, after that, the main altarpiece of the Church of Saint John the Baptist in Chiclana. In 1554 he contracted for the sacramental altarpiece of the Parish Church of Santa Mar\u00eda la Coronada in Medina Sidonia (Province of C\u00e1diz). Five reliefs on the upper level of the altarpiece are his originals, as is the Calvary at the top, which his will mentions had been completed.J. Porres Benavides and B. Dominguez G\u00f3mez: Retablo de Santa Mar\u00eda de Medina Sidonia. La conservacion de retablos: catalogaci\u00f3n, restauraci\u00f3n y difusi\u00f3n. Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda, 2006. . Calvary, upper portion of the Renaissance altarpiece of Santa Mar\u00eda La Mayor La Coronada, Medina Sidonia. His most notable mannerist works are Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Reina de Todos los Santos (\"Our Lady, Queen of All the Saints\") and Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Amparo (\"Our Lady of Amparo\"). The former is the patroness of the La Feria neighborhood of Seville, and presides over the basilical baldachin of the Parish of Omnium Sanctorum. Balduque sculpted in 1554 and sold it to the penitential confraternity of the same name, the Hermandad de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Reina de Todos los Santos, for 23 ducats. The latter resides in the Church of Saint Mary Magdalene in Seville, and is associated with a penitential confraternity of the same name, the Hermandad de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Amparo. It is one of the few processional sculptures that have a variety of garments: there is one each in red, green, sky blue, and salmon pink. It is also one of the few such sculptures associated both with a confraternity and with a parish. Between 1554 and 1556, Balduque also made sculptures and altarpieces for the Sevillian parishes of San Lorenzo, San Rom\u00e1n, Santa Marina, San Gil, San Nicol\u00e1s, San Vicente and San Juan de la Palma. Also in Seville are several other processional sculptures of his, all of the Virgin Mary, among them the Virgen de la Granada in the parish of San Lorenzo and the Virgen de la Rosa in the parish of San Vicente. Another work attributed to Roque Balduque or pertaining to your work environment is the valuable statue of Our Lady of Light that venerates in the Cathedral of San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna in Tenerife (Spain). La Virgen de la Luz de la Catedral de La Laguna (Tenerife) en el arte sevillano del siglo XVI In the Cathedral of Lima in Peru is the image of Our Lady of Evangelization, Patroness of the Archdiocese of Lima, also made by Roque Balduque. ==Notes== Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1561 deaths Category:Early Netherlandish sculptors Category:Flemish sculptors Category:16th-century Spanish sculptors Category:Spanish male sculptors Category:Renaissance sculptors ",
