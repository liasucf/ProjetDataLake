The name is derived from the personal name Jan, from Middle High German Johann 'John'. The morphology of the demonym Jan\u010dar indicates that the settlement likely originally had a longer name, such as Jan\u010de selo/brdo/polje (literally, 'John's village/hill/field').Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo\u0161ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo\u017eba ZRC, p. 174. The settlement is known as Jan\u010dje in the local dialect and was called Jantschberg in German in the past. ==History== There is evidence that the Jan\u010de area was already settled in prehistoric times. Jan\u010de had a prominent role during the 19th-century Slovene national revival. On 23 May 1869, the villagers attacked a demonstration in the village by the ethnic German gymnastics club from Ljubljana (). The villagers seized the club's banner and beat the participants, who fled to the paper factory in Vev\u010de to take refuge. In response, the Austro-Hungarian authorities sent troops to the village to pacify the residents. Several farmers were imprisoned, and Jakob Rode was killed in the conflict. During the Second World War, the Partisan commander of the \u0160ti\u010dna Company, Jo\u017ee Kova\u010di\u010d (1916\u20131942), was killed near the village in an engagement with German forces. Kova\u010di\u010d was later proclaimed a People's Hero of Yugoslavia. A hiking lodge was built in 1959 in the middle of the village, with a memorial plaque dedicated to Slovene Partisans of the 2nd group of detachments that fell in the Battle of Jan\u010de in May 1942. ==Church== The local parish church is dedicated to Saint Nicholas and belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ljubljana. It was a 17th-century chapel to which a nave was added in the early 18th century and a belfry in 1830.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference number e\u0161d 1863 A chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes was built next to the church in 1897, after the 1895 Ljubljana earthquake, which had its epicenter in the village. The church originally belonged to the proto-parish of \u0160martno pri Litiji, and was then part of the Parish of Pre\u017eganje. A vicariate was established in Jan\u010de in 1787, and it became a parish in 1805. ==Other cultural heritage== Chapel southwest of Jan\u010de Southwest of the village there is a chapel dedicated to Our Lady of the Rosary. It has a square floor plan, arched windows on the sides, and a stone door frame with a holy water font.
