It was dedicated to making New Orleans a supportive place for artists to live and work via its public programming: an online art review, a community supported art program that promotes affordable art sales, a pop-up exhibition program that activates under-utilized and/or vacant spaces in New Orleans, and a critic-in-residence program. In December 2014, Pelican Bomb's roving exhibition \"Foodways\" was featured in the Huffington Post and described as \"one of the gems of P.3\" by Priscilla Frank. \"Foodways\" was a part of the Prospect.3 triennial's local satellite programming and was open from October 25, 2014 through January 25, 2015. Pelican Bomb ceased operations in November 2018.http://pelicanbomb.com/events/2018/11/30/pelican-bomb-is-closing At that time, Pelican Bomb was led by founding editor and executive director Cameron Shaw and creative and operations director Amanda Brinkman. ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Visual arts magazines published in the United States Category:Contemporary art magazines Category:Magazines established in 2011 Category:Magazines published in Louisiana Category:Mass media in New Orleans Category:Online magazines published in the United States ",
