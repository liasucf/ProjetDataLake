    "text": "is a Japanese anime series produced by Ajia-do Animation Works and broadcast on NHK since April 10, 1993. It is an adaptation of the manga series Rakudai Ninja Rantar\u014d, written and illustrated by S\u014dbe Amako. Nintama Rantar\u014d centers on the title character and his friends as they attend a school for budding ninjas. Like the manga on which it is based, there are a considerable amount of anachronisms for comedic purposes; for example, the titular character Rantar\u014d is bespectacled. The anime also references other Japanese media personalities such as Ken Shimura. The series is currently the longest-running anime on NHK and the second longest-running anime series of all time. The official English title is Ninjaboy Rantaro.http://pf.nhk-ep.co.jp/detail/1976 In July 2011, a live action film version directed by Takashi Miike titled Ninja Kids!!! was released. ==Cast== ===First Year Ha Class=== ; : : The main character, a bespectacled first grade boy who is aiming to become an excellent ninja.

He claims to have problems making a friendly face. Enjoys pranking the first years, especially the main trio. ; : : A member of the Health Committee.

It is hard to keep him interested in anything else. He names all the holes that he digs, and he too is called \"The Trap Specialist\". Most of the Health Committee members have fallen in his traps. ; : : The other self-proclaimed \"Number One Idol of Ninjutsu Gakuen\". Mikiemon likes guns, cannons, and rifles, and names his and takes them for walks. He also idolizes Shousei, but not to the extent that Torawaka does. ; : : A transfer student who's very ambitious on becoming a ninja. He's the only person who laughs whenever Andou-sensei makes a joke. ; : : Raised as a hairdresser, his father was an undercover ninja. Eventually joins Ninjutsu Gakuen, and is allowed into fourth year despite having no previous training, because of his skills with his 'split second hairdressing'. ===Fifth Year=== ; : : Long eyelashes and black hair are his defining characteristics. Though his grades are superb and he\u2019s earnest and cool, his spontaneous nature was somewhat revealed when he\u2019d failed to realize that the costs of amazake were included in the Explosives Committee\u2019s appropriation. Since he had to carry tofu in the Sport\u2019s Day relay, he is known as the \u2018Tofu Kid\u2019. Truthfully he hates this nickname, and in the manga at times he denies liking tofu; however, in actuality he is abundant in tofu knowledge and he seems to like tofu cooking. In the anime he will openly declare his love for tofu and treat others to tofu he has prepared himself. He carries freeze-dried tofu around for a mid-afternoon snack. He is the stand-in committee president for the Explosives Committee and rounds up the underclassmen; even though he is Takamaru\u2019s senpai he adds \u201csan\u201d to his name since he is older. In the musical his weapon of choice is the suntetsu. In the survival orienteering he was paired in a group with Isuke. His surname comes from Kukuchi in Amagasaki. ; : : Though his first appearance was injuring the napping Rantarou, Kirimaru, and Shinbei while practicing his jinba technique, his existence was forgotten for a period of 16 years, until he reappeared in the mixed double survival orienteering in a pair with Torawaka, where his name was finally revealed. In the second occasion he appeared in he did not belong to any committee and was encouraged in vol. 47 by the Headmaster to decide which committee to join while each one ran their food stand at their culture festival. It was revealed then he was actually a class president and he ended up joining the class president committee. His specialty weapon is the manrikigusari. He is the airhead type who tends to get wrapped up in things. In the original work he has black hair, however; in the anime his hair is a deep reddish brown. In first person he uses \u201core\u201d; to his superiors he uses \u201cboku\u201d or \u201cwatashi\u201d. His surname comes from Ohama-cho in Amagasaki, and his name comes from the Kouga ninja Ukai Kanemon. ; : : Gentle and full of kindness; he is a senpai that lovingly takes care of his underclassmen. Though his grades are excellent, his bad habit is that he\u2019s always meandering and hesitating with a broad indecisiveness. After thinking too much, he tires and falls asleep right then and there. Of the \u201cthree illness of the ninja\u201d, he is the \u201ctype who lacks thought\u201d. Also, if he goes near a dry river bed, the moisture will expand his hair. Hachiya Saburou from the same class is often seen borrowing his face, lending them the relation of \u201cfifth-year rogumi\u2019s specialty combination\u201d. Yamada-sensei often says \u201dhis honesty is his weakness\u201d; however, in the 18th volume he passed the survival orienteering while retaining his playfulness. In that survival orienteering he was paired in a group with Ayakashimaru. In the original work Raizou\u2019s hair is black; however, in the anime it is a bright brown. His namesake is from a proverb meaning . ; : : A student with a thousand face, to the point that no one, including the school staff, knows his true face. Saburo is a mischievous, calm and cool student who enjoys wearing disguises of just about anyone, and sometimes alternates faces in-between scenes. Saburo most of the time disguises as Raizo considering the two are quite close friends. ; : : A student with cheerful, optimistic, energetic and also serious attitude. Hachizaemon features long unkempt dull grey-brown hair. As the head of Biological Committee, he holds responsibility in protecting wildlife from being harmed or hunted, which gains respect from his fellow junior committee members (which is dominated with first years). Attempts of hunting wildlife with his presence will only enrage him. ===Sixth Year=== ; : : Is often portrayed as a leader among the 6th year seniors. Monjiro is a strict, serious senior that focuses on training mentally as much as physically, and his committee members often gets forced into his bizarre trainings such as using 10 kg abacus, sleeping in cold lake at midnight, making weapons out of food, etc. Despite his serious commitments into trainings, he is easily approached outside of training and has good relationship as a caring senior towards his juniors. He has a favourite word - gin gin - that who only used when he gets excited, angry, or emotional. On occasional episodes, he together with Choji and Koheta tagged along with Kirimaru in his part-time job. ; : : A pale-skinned and often regarded as a handsome senior with long straight and silky hair. He leads the Saho committee along with Heidayu as his favorite junior. He has natural talents for explosive, bombs, grenades, often carrying dozens of them with him for convenient purpose. Being as normally a calm, rationally thinking senior, he is often described as an excellent student among the seniors. When carrying out solo missions, he often gets tagged along with Kisanta and Shinbei, who both look up to him, but instead of giving a good help, burdens him instead and gets him caught, bomb explodes in his face, trees fall down on him, etc. He has shorter temper for Kisanta and Shinbei harassing him in his missions. ; : : A student who spoke with few words and with few facial expressions. Choji who speak slowly, that made his words hard to be conveyed at times, is also the head of librarian. Usually, someone who stands besides him (such as Raizo or Kirimaru who are also librarians) had to be the 'translator' especially to those who don't meet Choji quite often. His expressions can get eerie with one big creepy smile, though his true emotions often contrast his face (such as he will smile creepily when he is hurt, and vice versa). Ironically, Shinbei's little sister Kameko found his smile to be attractive, and even had a crush on him at times. ; : : Koheita, a sixth-year student with much energy and happy- go-lucky, cheerful, exciting and reckless personality. He made a hobby of digging trenches on soil, sometimes using only a pair of kunai, and sometimes with his bare hands. Apart from that, he also has the tendency to spike just about anything that flies towards him to the ground, like a volleyball spike (which occasionally causes problems to others, and even broke his arm). He is easily approachable by others and treats his juniors that come forward for his help with respect, though sometimes, with reckless running. His favorite word: \"Ike Ike Don Don\" ; : : A student Hagumi that has strong fighting spirit, aggressive and hot tempered, but still cares for his juniors with good tolerant. Tomesaburo and Monjiro are however, tends to argue which then leads them to brawl and fight each other over 'who is better' or 'who is right' matters. His appearance resembles another character in the series, Yoshiro Suzukoya, which was pointed out by Kihachiro. Tomesaburo and Isaku are classmates, and also roommates, and appears to be close. ; : : A nice, friendly and caring student of 6th year Hagumi that has a personality akin to a gentle big brother to his juniors, though is cursed with bad luck to himself, and anyone that gets tagged along with him. Also dubbed by others and his own members - 'bad luck chairman' - and his own committee as 'bad luck committee'. As a Health Committee chairman, he takes on his job giving aid to injured or sick person responsibly and unbiased, that he also treated a Tasogaredoki ninja Zatto Konnamon, who was supposing to be an intruder. He and his committee members often gets greeted by Konnamon uninformed, sometimes with presence of other Tasogaredoki ninjas. ===Kunoichi Class=== ; : : She's the leader of the kunoichi trio. ; : : Tomomi is the class president and part of the kunoichi trio. ; : : Shige is the grand daughter of the principal and part of the kunoichi trio. She's in love with Shinbe. She is an anime-only character. ===Staff=== ; : : Another teacher of Rantaro. He serves to teach the actual techniques and trains the lazy first graders. Denzo tends to lose his patience faster than Doi. He also shows unnatural fondness in disguising himself as a woman, usually with disastrous results. When he's dressed as a woman, his personality transforms completely too, and he refuses to answer to anything besides 'Denko'. He is Yamada Rikichi's father. ; : : Rantar\u014d's main classroom teacher. He often loses patience with Rantaro and his classmates due to their inability to pay attention. His personality appears to have been the inspiration for Iruka Umino, another ninja teacher who is voiced by the same voice actor. ; : : ; : : A dog skilled in ninjutsu, he is the longtime companion of the head master. Also in charge of ringing the school bell ; : : The teacher of the female nintamas, she alternates between the form of a young woman and an old lady.
