    "text": "...Sounds Like This is the third album from English progressive rock band Nektar, released in 1973. It was the first Nektar album to be released in their home country of the United Kingdom. An attempt to recreate the band's live sound, ...Sounds Like This was largely improvised and dominated by extensive instrumental jamming, in contrast to their usual concept and composition-driven albums. The different approach to recording, combined with a number of difficulties with the mixing, resulted in it being the band's heaviest work. ==Background and recording== The idea behind ...Sounds Like This, conceived by the band themselves, was to create an album that recreated Nektar's live sound while avoiding the various recording and sound quality difficulties inherent to live recordings. To this end, on 12 October 1972 the band set up their gear in Dierks Studios and performed for a little over an hour to an audience of just a small group of friends. None of the songs played had been written and rehearsed ahead of the time; some were loosely built on riffs and lyrical concepts that the band had been working on, while others were completely improvised. Dissatisfied with the original master, Nektar and producer Peter Hauke opted to do a series of dubs and re-recordings, which took place in February. Of the tracks recorded during the original October session, only \"Wings\" appeared on the album in its original form, without dubbing or additional takes. Two songs from the original session (\"Sunshine Down on the City\" and \"It's All in Ya Mind\") were cut from the album entirely, and new songs that had been written in the intervening four months were added. The original sleeve notes state the album to have been recorded entirely in February 1973, omitting the October 1972 session. Several of the recordings from the October 1972 session later appeared as bonus tracks. ==Reception== Allmusic's brief retrospective review dismissed ...Sounds Like This as \"a step backward, with lighter, less ambitious songs that didn't work as well as their long form sound.\" == Track listing == ==Personnel== *Roye Albrighton \u2013 lead vocals, guitars *Allan \"Taff\" Freeman \u2013 keyboards, vocals *Derek \"Mo\" Moore \u2013 bass, vocals *Ron Howden \u2013 drums, percussion *Mick Brockett \u2013 lights ===Production=== *Peter Hauke \u2013 producer *Dieter Dierks \u2013 engineer ==References== ==External links== * Sounds Like This at TheNektarProject.com Category:Nektar albums Category:1973 albums Category:Bacillus Records albums ",
