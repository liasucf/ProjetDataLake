The company was founded in 2011 and has branches in Cyprus, United States and Eastern Europe. DEVAR raised $5 million in two venture rounds, including $2 million of seed funding in 2015 and the $3 million investment from Leta Capital in 2018. The company developed a global augmented reality platform that allows publishers to enhance traditional books with interactive AR content and integrated audio.

In 2014, the company was approached by representatives of a production plant manufacturing equipment and components for the nuclear industry. They requested the company to develop a CCTV system that could monitor nuclear reactors. The plant specialized in producing robots that could be launched inside a reactor and required software based on computer vision to enable them to read and transfer data on the reactor\u2019s performance to the supervisors. Later that year, at MIPIM, a real-estate exhibition in France, the company presented a mobile app that projected the future constructions right off the model. They also developed an animated Biology textbook and an atlas of the world fauna.

The computer vision system identified a flat image and reproduced the colors that were used by kids on a 3D model located in the real-world environment. In January 2015, the team incorporated the DEVAR kids brand and registered DEVAR Media company. In 6 months, the company sold 500,000 copies of books in Eastern Europe.
