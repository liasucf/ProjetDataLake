    "text": "Crazy World is the eleventh studio album by German hard rock band Scorpions, released on 6 November 1990. The album peaked at No. 21 on the Billboard 200 chart for albums in 1991. That same year, the song \"Wind of Change\" reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and \"Send Me an Angel\" reached No. 44 on the same chart. It also has the only Scorpions track to credit Buchholz as a writer, \"Kicks After Six\". This album was the band's first album in a decade and a half to not be produced by Dieter Dierks and is widely considered to be the last \"classic\" Scorpions album. In the UK, it remains the only Scorpions album to attain Silver certification (60,000 units sold) by the British Phonographic Industry, achieving this in November 1991. In the United States, it is the band's second best-selling album to 1984's Love at First Sting, and their last one to be certified at least gold by the RIAA.It was the last studio album to feature the Lovedrive-era lineup, with bassist Francis Buchholz leaving the band in January 1992. \"Hit Between the Eyes\" was played during the ending credits of the 1992 film Freejack. \"Send Me an Angel\" was played at the closing scene in the 2004 Cold Case episode \"Who's Your Daddy.\" \"Wind of Change\" was also used during the 2009 film Gentlemen Broncos and towards the end of the 2014 film The Interview. == Track listing == == Personnel == ===Scorpions=== * Klaus Meine \u2013 lead vocals * Rudolf Schenker \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals, lead guitar on \"Wind of Change\" and \"Send Me an Angel\" * Matthias Jabs \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals, rhythm guitar on \"Wind of Change\" and \"Send Me an Angel\" * Francis Buchholz \u2013 bass, backing vocals * Herman Rarebell \u2013 drums, backing vocals ===Additional musicians=== *Koen van Baal, Robbie Buchanan \u2013 keyboards on \"Wind of Change\" *Jim Vallance \u2013 keyboards on \"Send Me an Angel\" *Michael Thompson \u2013 guitar on \"Wind of Change\" *Roy Tesse, Dries van der Schuyt, Ria Makker, Gerard v.d.
