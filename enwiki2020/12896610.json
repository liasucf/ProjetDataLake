Trini Lopez makes a guest appearance as the performer at the Prom. ==Plot== It is the final week of senior year at American High School and Gwen Adams considers divorcing her new husband Holden Adams, whom she married because her rival Hilary Weiss is also trying to be his girlfriend. She faces the problems created by Hilary's plot to become prom queen and decides to run for prom queen herself. The married couple are caught having sex by Principal Mann. The principal faces forced resignation and hatches a plan with Gwen, another teacher and some other students, to get her job back from Ms. Apple.
