    "text": "In mathematics, a polynomial decomposition expresses a polynomial f as the functional composition g \\circ h of polynomials g and h, where g and h have degree greater than 1; it is an algebraic functional decomposition. Algorithms are known for decomposing univariate polynomials in polynomial time. Polynomials which are decomposable in this way are composite polynomials; those which are not are called indecomposable polynomials of sometimes prime polynomials.J.F. Ritt, \"Prime and Composite Polynomials\", Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 23:1:51\u201366 (January, 1922) (not to be confused with irreducible polynomials, which cannot be factored into products of polynomials). The rest of this article discusses only univariate polynomials; algorithms also exist for multivariate polynomials of arbitrary degree.Jean- Charles Faug\u00e8re, Ludovic Perret, \"An efficient algorithm for decomposing multivariate polynomials and its applications to cryptography\", Journal of Symbolic Computation, 44:1676-1689 (2009), ==Examples== In the simplest case, one of the polynomials is a monomial. For example, :f = x^6 - 3 x^3 + 1 decomposes into :g = x^2 - 3 x + 1 \\text{ and } h = x^3 since :f(x) = (g \\circ h)(x) = g(h(x)) = g(x^3) = (x^3)^2 - 3 (x^3) + 1, using the ring operator symbol \u2218 to denote function composition. Less trivially, : \\begin{align} & x^6-6 x^5+21 x^4-44 x^3+68 x^2-64 x+41 \\\\\\ = {} & (x^3+9 x^2+32 x+41) \\circ (x^2-2 x). \\end{align} ==Uniqueness== A polynomial may have distinct decompositions into indecomposable polynomials where f = g_1 \\circ g_2 \\circ \\cdots \\circ g_m = h_1 \\circ h_2 \\circ \\cdots\\circ h_n where g_i eq h_i for some i. The restriction in the definition to polynomials of degree greater than one excludes the infinitely many decompositions possible with linear polynomials. Joseph Ritt proved that m = n, and the degrees of the components are the same, but possibly in different order; this is Ritt's polynomial decomposition theorem.Capi Corrales-Rodrig\u00e1\u00f1ez, \"A note on Ritt's theorem on decomposition of polynomials\", Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra 68:3:293\u2013296 (6 December 1990) For example, x^2 \\circ x^3 = x^3 \\circ x^2. ==Applications== A polynomial decomposition may enable more efficient evaluation of a polynomial. For example, : \\begin{align} & x^8 + 4 x^7 + 10 x^6 + 16 x^5 + 19 x^4 + 16 x^3 + 10 x^2 + 4 x - 1 \\\\\\ = {} & (x^2 - 2) \\circ (x^2) \\circ (x^2 + x + 1) \\end{align} can be calculated with only 3 multiplications using the decomposition, while Horner's method would require 7. A polynomial decomposition enables calculation of symbolic roots using radicals, even for some irreducible polynomials. This technique is used in many computer algebra systems.The examples below were calculated using Maxima. For example, using the decomposition : \\begin{align} & x^6 - 6 x^5 + 15 x^4 - 20 x^3 + 15 x^2 - 6 x - 1 \\\\\\ = {} & (x^3 - 2) \\circ (x^2 - 2 x + 1), \\end{align} the roots of this irreducible polynomial can be calculated as :1 \\pm 2^{1/6}, 1 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{3}i}}{2^{1/3}}.Where each \u00b1 is taken independently. Even in the case of quartic polynomials, where there is an explicit formula for the roots, solving using the decomposition often gives a simpler form. For example, the decomposition : \\begin{align} & x^4 - 8 x^3 + 18 x^2 - 8 x + 2 \\\\\\ = {} & (x^2 + 1) \\circ (x^2 - 4 x + 1) \\end{align} gives the roots : 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3 \\pm i} but straightforward application of the quartic formula gives equivalent results but in a form that is difficult to simplify and difficult to understand: : 2-{ \\frac{\\sqrt{{{ 9 \\left(\\frac{8 \\sqrt{10} i}{3^{3/2}} + 72\\right)^{2/3} + 36 \\left(\\frac{8 \\sqrt{10} i}{3^{3/2}} + 72\\right)^{1/3} + 156} \\over {\\left({\\frac{8 \\sqrt{10} i}{3^{3/2}}} + 72\\right)^{1/3}}}}} 6}-{{\\sqrt{-\\left(\\frac{8 \\sqrt{10} i}{3^{3/2}} + 72\\right)^{1/3}-{{52}\\over{3 \\left(\\frac{8 \\sqrt{10} i}{3^{3/2}} +72\\right)^{1/3}}} + 8}}\\over 2} . ==Algorithms== The first algorithm for polynomial decomposition was published in 1985,David R. Barton, Richard Zippel, \"Polynomial Decomposition Algorithms\", Journal of Symbolic Computation 1:159\u2013168 (1985) though it had been discovered in 1976Richard Zippel , \"Functional Decomposition\" (1996) full text and implemented in the Macsyma computer algebra system.Available in its open-source successor, Maxima, see the polydecomp function That algorithm takes worst-case exponential time but works independently of the characteristic of the underlying field. More recent algorithms run in polynomial time but with restrictions on the characteristic.Dexter Kozen, Susan Landau, \"Polynomial Decomposition Algorithms\", Journal of Symbolic Computation 7:445\u2013456 (1989) The most recent algorithm calculates a decomposition in polynomial time and without restrictions on the characteristic.Raoul Blankertz, \"A polynomial time algorithm for computing all minimal decompositions of a polynomial\", ACM Communications in Computer Algebra 48:1 (Issue 187, March 2014) full text ==Notes== ==References== * Joel S.
