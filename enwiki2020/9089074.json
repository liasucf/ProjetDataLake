    "text": "Frederick Warren Grover (September 3, 1876 - January 30, 1973) was an American physicist and electrical engineer. Grover worked as a physicist at the National Bureau of Standards, and he went to study with Arnold Sommerfeld at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in 1907. He was awarded his doctorate in 1908, and his thesis dealt with precision measurements and theory of eddy currents to determine a new method for finding the conductivity of metals. Upon receipt of his doctorate, he again worked at the National Bureau of Standards. Later, as Professor of Electrical Engineering, he taught at Union College in Schenectady, New York from 1920 to 1946.Grover \u2013 American Institute of PhysicsEckert, 1999, p. 244.Grover \u2013 Electrical Inductance Grover received a B.S. degree from MIT in 1899, an M.S. degree from Wesleyan University in 1901, a Ph.D. degree from George Washington University in 1907, and a second Ph.D. degree from the University of Munich, Germany in 1908. ==Publications== * Frederick W.
