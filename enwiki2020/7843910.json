    "text": "L'Ankou, written and drawn by Fournier, is the twenty-seventh album of the Spirou et Fantasio series, and the author's seventh, following the Spirou retirement of Andr\u00e9 Franquin. The story was initially serialised in Spirou magazine, before it was released as a hardcover album in 1977. ==Story== In L'Ankou, Oror\u00e9a invites Spirou and Fantasio to join her at a congress of magicians in Brittany. When they arrive, they meet strange L'Ankou, who objects to the presence of a nuclear thermal power station on his land. They then save Oror\u00e9a from an aggression, but the gangsters manage to escape. At their arrival at the hotel, they find out that Itoh Kata is amongst the magicians invited. The others are telepath Al Kazar, hypnotist monk Capuccino and telekinesist Rethros Athana. Those are currently developing a magic trick based on teleportation. Fantasio is used as guinea-pig during the first representation but is abducted by the gangsters. Ankou reappears and suggests to Spirou and his friends not to try anything against the kidnappers. The latter exert blackmail on the magicians: they are to deliver a revolutionary product developed at the power station in exchange for Fantasio. Kata decides not to say anything to his friends and together, the magicians steal the product. Meanwhile, Fantasio manages to escape and warns the police with Spirou and Oror\u00e9a. The gangsters are arrested but the product stolen by the magicians threatens to explode. Fortunately, Spirou warns the magicians in time and Itoh Kata makes the product vanish. This event leads to the power station closing down. L'Ankou is thus grateful towards Spirou and his companions. ==References== * Fournier publications in Spirou BDoubli\u00e9es ==External links== *Spirou official site album index Ankou, L Category:Works originally published in Spirou (magazine) Category:Literature first published in serial form Category:1977 graphic novels Category:1977 in comics Category:Comics set in France Category:Brittany in fiction ",
