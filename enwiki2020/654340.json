Its central area is surrounded by a cluster of flat-topped peaks roughly corresponding to the cardinal directions. The north peak (Beitai Ding or Yedou Feng) is the highest () and is also the highest point in northern China. As host to over 53 sacred monasteries, Mount Wutai is home to many of China's most important monasteries and temples. It was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2009China\u2019s sacred Buddhist Mount Wutai inscribed on UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage List. UNESCO World Heritage Centre and named a AAAAA tourist attraction by China's National Tourism Administration in 2007. ==Significance== Mount Wutai is one of the Four Sacred Mountains in Chinese Buddhism. Each of the mountains is viewed as the bodhima\u1e47\u1e0da () of one of the four great bodhisattvas. W\u01d4t\u00e1i is the home of the Bodhisattva of wisdom, Ma\u00f1ju\u015br\u012b or \"\" () in Chinese. Ma\u00f1ju\u015br\u012b has been associated with Mount Wutai since ancient times. Paul Williams writes:Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations. 2000. p. 227 Wutai was the first of the mountains to be identified and is often referred to as \"first among the four great mountains\". It was identified on the basis of a passage in the Avata\u1e43saka S\u016btra, which describes the abodes of many bodhisattvas. In this chapter, Ma\u00f1ju\u015br\u012b is said to reside on a \"clear cold mountain\" in the northeast. This served as charter for the mountain's identity and its alternate name \"Clear Cool Mountain\" (). The bodhisattva is believed to frequently appear on the mountain, taking the form of ordinary pilgrims, monks, or most often unusual five-colored clouds. Reflecting regional rivalries between Buddhist centers, 9th-century Chan Buddhism master Linji Yixuan criticized the prominence of Wutai in Tang dynasty China. According to the posthumously compiled L\u00ednj\u00ec y\u01d4l\u00f9, Linji Yixuan once said, \u201cThere\u2018s a bunch of students who seek Ma\u00f1ju\u015br\u012b on Mount Wutai. Wrong from the start! There\u2018s no Ma\u00f1ju\u015br\u012b on Mount Wutai.\u201c His campaign was however not successful, and even after the Tang era Mount Wutai \u201ccontinued to thrive as perhaps the single most famous Buddhist sacred site in China.\u201d Mount Wutai has an enduring relationship with Tibetan Buddhism.Tuttle, Gray (2006). 'Tibetan Buddhism at Ri bo rtse lnga/Wutai shan in Modern Times.' Journal of the International Association of Tibetan Studies, no. 2 (August 2006): 1-35. Source: (accessed: Monday, July 1, 2013) Mount Wutai is home to some of the oldest wooden buildings in China that have survived since the era of the Tang Dynasty (618\u2013907). This includes the main hall of Nanchan Temple and the East Hall of Foguang Temple, built in 782 and 857, respectively. They were discovered in 1937 and 1938 by a team of architectural historians including the prominent early 20th-century historian Liang Sicheng. The architectural designs of these buildings have since been studied by leading sinologists and experts in traditional Chinese architecture, such as Nancy Steinhardt. Steinhardt classified these buildings according to the hall types featured in the Yingzao Fashi Chinese building manual written in the 12th century. In 2008, there were complaints from local residents that, in preparation for Mount Wutai's bid to become a UNESCO World Heritage Site, they were forced from their homes and relocated away from their livelihoods. ==Major temples== Nanshan Temple () is a large temple in Mount W\u01d4t\u00e1i, first built in the Yuan Dynasty. The whole temple comprises seven terraces, divided into three parts. The lower three terraces are named Jile Temple (); the middle terrace is called Shande Hall (); the upper three terraces are named Youguo Temple (). Other major temples include Xiantong Temple, Tayuan Temple and Pusading Temple. Other important temples inside Mount Wutai include Shouning Temple, Bishan Temple, Puhua Temple, Dailuo Ding, Qixian Temple, Shifang Tang, Shuxiang Temple, Guangzong Temple, Youguo Temple, Guanyin Dong, Longhua Temple, Luomuhou Temple, Jinge Temple, Zhanshan Temple, Wanfo Ge, Guanhai Temple, Zhulin Temple, Jifu Temple, and Gufo Temple.
