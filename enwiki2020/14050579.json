The One Drop tournament would be held as a competition within the larger WSOP series of tournaments held each summer in Las Vegas. The first tournament, known as The Big One for One Drop, was held as part of the 2012 WSOP, and had a record per person buy-in of US$1 million. The WSOP waived its normal 10% rake of the entry fees, and $111,111 of each buy-in went to the Foundation. The 48 seats available in the event were filled, creating a poker record first prize of $18.3 million and a donation to One Drop of $5.33 million. Caesars Interactive Entertainment CEO Mitch Garber, ineligible to play, donated $111,111 while One Drop founder Lalibert\u00e9 donated his entire fifth-place winnings of $1.83 million, for a total donation of $7.28 million from this single tournament game. As part of the initial 2012 event, Caesars announced that One Drop has become an official charity of the WSOP, and it encouraged all players who cashed during any tournament at the 2012 WSOP to donate 1% of their winnings to One Drop. Labelled the \"All in for One Drop\", the 2013 campaign saw 458 players contribute $0.25 million of their winnings from tournaments held during the 2013 WSOP. ==References== ==External links== * One Drop's official website * Cirque du Soleil One Drop's page Category:Cirque du Soleil Category:Organizations based in Montreal Category:Organizations established in 2007 ",
