    "text": "PTV News Headlines: Today's News, Tomorrow's Headlines is an English late night news program of People's Television Network, airing weeknights from 9:30 to 10:30 PM PST and with replays on Tuesdays to Fridays from 6:00 to 7:00 AM PST. As part of programming changes brought about by the relaunch of PTV on June 28, 2017, the English edition of PTV News was rebranded as PTV News Headlines, following the launch of two more newscasts, Sentro Balita and Ulat Bayan. It was originally anchored by PTV News holdovers Richmond Cruz and Charms Espina. On January 2, 2020, Joee Guilas joined the newscast, replacing Cruz, who left on December 30, 2019. On July 31, 2020, as part of PTV's programming revamp, PTV News Headlines air their last broadcast to make way for PTV News Tonight. ==Anchors== ===Final anchors=== * Charms Espina (2017\u20132020) * Joee Guilas (2020) * Catherine Vital (2020) ===Fill-in Anchors=== *Diane Querrer *Juliet Caranguian *Naomi Tiburcio *Mela Lesmoras *Audrey Gorriceta ===Former Anchors=== * Richmond Cruz (2017\u20132019) ==Segments== *Top Stories *Malaca\u00f1an *Business News *Foreign News *The Nation *PTV InfoWeather *PAGASA-DOST Weather Update *PTV Sports ==Reporters== * Bea Bernardo * Louisa Erispe * Mark Fetalco * Allan Francisco * Deo De Guzman * Bernard Jaudian Jr. * Patrick De Jesus * Mica Ella Joson * Ryan Lesigues * Mela Lesmoras * Daniel Amos Manalastas * Kenneth Paciente * Cleizl Pardilla * Sandra Samala * Eunice Samonte * Stephanie Sevillano * Naomi Tiburcio * Karen Villanda == References == Category:Philippine television news shows Category:People's Television Network original programming Category:English- language television shows Category:2017 Philippine television series debuts ",
