It was likely authored by Bergr Sokkason and is written in the 'florid style' characteristic of the North Icelandic Benedictine School. The text is extant in two manuscripts from the 14th and 15th centuries. The \u00fe\u00e1ttur is unique among other bishops' sagas for two reasons. Firstly, it is the only such text to focus on a Norwegian bishop. Secondly, the narrative structure is based around a series of exempla, and appears to have been influenced by the Dominican style of preaching. For this reason, Sigurdson has argued against Gu\u00f0r\u00fan \u00c1sa Gr\u00edmsd\u00f3ttir's suggestion that J\u00f3ns \u00fe\u00e1ttr may have been written as a plan for a fully-fledged bishop's saga. The \u00fe\u00e1ttur does not include details of J\u00f3n's ecclesiastical or political activities which are recorded in L\u00e1rent\u00edus saga and other sources. Sigurdson writes \"J\u00f3n Halld\u00f3rsson was an innovative and influential bishop, a legal expert, and a bureaucrat; the omission of any of this from his \u00fe\u00e1ttur serves to further prove how far removed this piece of literature is from any of the bishops' sagas.\" == Bibliography == === Manuscripts === * AM 657 4to (14th century) * AM 624 4to (15th century) === Editions === * * * * == References == Category:Bishops' sagas ",
