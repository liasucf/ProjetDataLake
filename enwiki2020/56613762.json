    "text": "Telef\u00f3nica SA v Commission (2014) C-295/12 is a European competition law case relevant for UK enterprise law, concerning telecommunications. ==Facts== Telefonica appealed against a Commission fine of \u20ac151m for abuse of dominance for wholesale ADSL broadband in Spain from 2001-2006. Telefonica had a statutory monopoly on retail provision of landlines before 1998. It was the only company with a nationwide fixed telephone network. It provided wholesale broadband to other telecomms companies, and its own retail services. The Commission found Telefonica imposed unfair prices through a margin squeeze on competitors, so the difference between their wholesale prices and its retail prices were not enough to make a profit. It assessed Telefonica\u2019s downstream costs using LRAIC as the standard. The General Court held that to establish a margin squeeze there was no need to show excessive or predatory prices: the abuse was in the spread available. The test was whether an equally efficient competitor, based on the dominant undertaking\u2019s own costs could survive. ==Judgment== The CJEU upheld the General Court's decision in its entirety, so that Telefonica still had to pay a fine for abuse of a dominant position. ==See also== *United Kingdom enterprise law *EU law ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== * Category:United Kingdom enterprise case law ",
