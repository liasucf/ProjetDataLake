    "text": "Jimmy Boubou K\u00e9b\u00e9 (born 19 January 1984) is a former professional footballer who played as a right winger. Born in France, he represented Mali at international level. ==Club career== Born in Vitry-sur-Seine, France, K\u00e9b\u00e9 started his footballing career at RC Lens. He played predominately for the B side before having successful loan spells at clubs Ch\u00e2teauroux and Boulogne. ===Reading=== On 16 January 2008, K\u00e9b\u00e9 agreed to join Reading after being spotted by the then scout Brian McDermott, but his then club US Boulogne initially refused to let him end his season-long loan early. K\u00e9b\u00e9 went on strike in order for Boulogne to release him from his loan spell early to join Reading. On 28 January 2008, Reading announced that K\u00e9b\u00e9 had signed a 2\u00bd year contract with them, moving for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut for Reading as a substitute, coming on for John Oster late into a 1\u20130 away defeat to Everton on 9 February 2008 and should have opened his Reading account minutes later. He scored his first Reading goal in the 1\u20132 home defeat against Southampton on 22 November 2008. On 6 December 2008 he was sent off for the first time in his Reading career for aiming an elbow towards Barnsley defender Dennis Souza. K\u00e9b\u00e9 has since extended his contract until the summer of 2012. 2010 saw an up-turn in K\u00e9b\u00e9's goal-scoring form, notching up 13 goals in the Championship in the 2010 calendar year. On 21 August 2010, K\u00e9b\u00e9 played his 100th game for Reading, appearing in a 1\u20131 draw with Nottingham Forest at the Madejski Stadium. The 2011\u201312 season saw a further development in K\u00e9b\u00e9's position at Reading, with a well-publicised dispute over his contract. Having shown himself to be one of Reading's key players in the 2010/11 Playoff push, the club were eager to see him sign a new long term contract to ward off interest from other clubs such as Leicester City as his contract was at the time due to run out at the end of the 2011\u201312 season. It soon became clear that K\u00e9b\u00e9 wanted to stay at the club, but was reluctant to sign a two-year deal rather than the three-year deal he wanted. Reading could not afford to offer K\u00e9b\u00e9 a three-year, despite being willing to make him one of their highest earners. This ongoing contract saga continued into the new year, with Reading manager Brian McDermott becoming increasingly resigned to the possibility of losing his prized winger. On 5 January 2012, it was confirmed that Reading had offered Kebe a new contract for the three years that he wanted. On 24 January 2012, following Anton Zingarevich's takeover of Reading, Kebe signed a new contract that will keep him at Reading until 2014. Kebe scored his first Premier League goal in a 2\u20132 draw at home to Newcastle United. He scored on his return from injury with a cool finish at home to Arsenal in a 5\u20132 defeat. His next goal came at home to West Bromwich Albion with a far post diving header, to pull one back with 8 minutes to go. This sparked a dramatic comeback from the Royals who scored two more late goals in the dying moments to win 3\u20132. In January 2013, K\u00e9b\u00e9 announced on his official Twitter page that he had joined Newcastle United F.C.]Newcastle United, this was then picked up by several media outlets, only for K\u00e9b\u00e9 to reveal that it had been a joke due to the number of French-speaking players Newcastle had recently signed. Kebe scored both the goals as Reading beat Sunderland at home 2\u20131, to move out of the relegation zone. After the match Reading captain Jobi McAnuff proclaimed K\u00e9b\u00e9 to be a big player for Reading and a real sight to see when he's in full flow and I'm glad he's in our side when he's on song like this.\". After the same game, K\u00e9b\u00e9 also received special praise from manager Brian McDermott who proclaimed K\u00e9b\u00e9 has been brilliant for me in the three years I have had this job. He then injured his groin in the early minutes of the 1\u20133 defeat to Everton on 2 March 2013, and was ruled out for the rest of the season. Reading were subsequently relegated from the Premier League at the end of the season. In August 2013, after 6 months out injured with a groin strain, K\u00e9b\u00e9 was set to make a comeback for Reading in a match against Peterborough in the League Cup, however he controversially dropped out of contention with an injury, with manager Nigel Adkins unhappy about the timing after speculation linking K\u00e9b\u00e9 with a move to Crystal Palace. K\u00e9b\u00e9 revealed that he did not refuse to play and that he missed the game due to a hamstring injury. ===Crystal Palace=== On 31 August 2013, K\u00e9b\u00e9 was signed by Ian Holloway for Crystal Palace on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee. K\u00e9b\u00e9 made his Palace debut against Manchester United on 14 September in a 2\u20130 away defeat at Old Trafford. Not long after K\u00e9b\u00e9 joined the club, manager Ian Holloway left, and was replaced by Tony Pulis. On 8 January 2014, after dropping down the pecking order under Pulis, Leeds United approached Crystal Palace to take K\u00e9b\u00e9 on loan for the remainder of the season and to reunite with his former Reading manager Brian McDermott. Pulis confirmed in his pre- match press conference on 9 January that K\u00e9b\u00e9 had been in talks with Leeds and was set to join them on loan until the end of the 2013/14 season. on 23 January 2015 his Crystal Palace Contract was terminated. ===Leeds United (loan)=== On 10 January 2014, K\u00e9b\u00e9 signed on a 6-month loan for Leeds United. The deal contained a clause to make the move permanent at the end of the season if Leeds are promoted. K\u00e9b\u00e9 was awarded the number 38 shirt. K\u00e9b\u00e9 made his Leeds debut on 11 January, starting the game in a 6\u20130 defeat against Sheffield Wednesday. On 1 February 2014, only the day after the alleged sacking of K\u00e9b\u00e9's mentor Brian McDermott, K\u00e9b\u00e9 scored his first goal for Leeds in a 5-1 victory against local rivals Huddersfield Town. On 1 March, in Leeds draw against Q.P.R. K\u00e9b\u00e9 was subject of chants to be substituted, with Leeds fans calling for the arrival of Sam Byram due to K\u00e9b\u00e9's mixed displays since signing for the club. After the game manager Brian McDermott leapt to the defence of K\u00e9b\u00e9's performances and work rate and proclaimed he believed K\u00e9b\u00e9 could still become a fans' favourite. ===Return to Crystal Palace, release and Real Mallorca=== At the end of the 2013/14 season, Leeds decided against making Kebe's loan permanent and he returned to Palace, where upon his return he was deemed surplus to requirements. He joined Real Mallorca in Spain but did not make a single appearance. Keb\u00e9 later retired, and now plays professional poker, where he is ranked 6,473 in the world. ==International career== He was part of the Mali football team in the 2004 Summer Olympics, finishing top of Group A, but losing to Italy 1\u20130 (aet) in the next round. ==Career statistics== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|FL Trophy !colspan=\"2\"|Play-offs !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals |- |rowspan=\"7\"|Reading |2007\u201308 |5||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||5||0 |- |2008\u201309 |41||2||1||0||0||0||0||0||2||0||44||2 |- |2009\u201310 |42||10||5||2||0||0||0||0||0||0||47||12 |- |2010\u201311 |36||9||3||0||2||0||0||0||1||0||42||9 |- |2011\u201312 |33||3||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||33||3 |- |2012\u201313 |16||5||0||0||1||0||0||0||0||0||17||5 |- !Total !173||29||9||2||3||0||0||0||3||0||188||31 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Crystal Palace |2013\u201314 |6||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||6||0 |- !Total||6||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||6||0 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Leeds United |2013\u201314 |5||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||5||1 |- !Total||5||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||5||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Career total !184||30||9||2||3||0||0||0||3||0||199||32 |} ==Honours== Reading *Football League Championship: 2011\u201312 ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:People from Vitry-sur- Seine Category:Sportspeople from Val-de-Marne Category:Association football wingers Category:French footballers Category:Malian footballers Category:Malian expatriate footballers Category:Mali international footballers Category:Footballers at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic footballers of Mali Category:French people of Malian descent Category:RC Lens players Category:LB Ch\u00e2teauroux players Category:US Boulogne players Category:Reading F.C. players Category:Crystal Palace F.C. players Category:Ligue 2 players Category:Premier League players Category:English Football League players Category:Expatriate footballers in England ",
