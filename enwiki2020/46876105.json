It is one of the properties that arose during the nineteenth century henequen boom. There are numerous other properties of this name in the Yucat\u00e1n including Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n in Baca, Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n (Halach\u00f3), Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n (Motul), Hacienda Kankabch\u00e9n (Sey\u00e9), Hacienda Kankabch\u00e9n (Tixkokob), Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n (Tunk\u00e1s), Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n Uc\u00ed and Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n de Valencia. ==Toponymy== The name (Kancabch\u00e9n) is a word from the Mayan language meaning the well of the red ground. ==How to get there== Go east out of M\u00e9rida on highway 180 approximately 42 km to the exit for the town of Hoctun. Head south approximately 35 km though the towns of Xocchel, Sahcab\u00e1, Huh\u00ed to Zavala. At Zavala turn southwest on Calle 8 and follow the road approximately 6 km to Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n. ==History== In 1939 the name changed from Kancabch\u00e9n to Chan Kancabch\u00e9n; in 1970, it changed again to Kanka-Chen; and in 1990 it returned to Kancabch\u00e9n. ==Demographics== All of the henequen plantations ceased to exist as autonomous communities with the agrarian land reform implemented by President Lazaro Cardenas in 1937. His decree turned the haciendas into collective ejidos, leaving only 150 hectares to the former landowners for use as private property. Figures before 1937 indicate populations living on the farm. After 1937, figures indicate those living in the community, as the remaining Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n houses only the owner's immediate family. According to the 2005 census conducted by the INEGI, the population of the city was 11 inhabitants. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:right;\" |+ Population of Kancabch\u00e9n by year |- !
