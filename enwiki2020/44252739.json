He is a DirectorProfile of Andreas Seidel-Morgenstern at MPI Magdeburg of the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems in Magdeburg and Chair of Chemical Engineering at Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg. == Education & professional career == Andreas Seidel-Morgenstern graduated from Technische Hochschule Leuna- Merseburg and received a Ph.D. from the Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin in 1987. After working as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville he defended a Habilitation at the Technical University Berlin in 1994. Subsequently he worked for Schering AG in Berlin, before becoming in 1995 Professor of Chemical Process Engineering at the Otto von Guericke University in Magdeburg. In 2002 he was appointed as a Director at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems, where he is head of the \u201cPhysical and Chemical Foundations of Process Engineering\u201d group. The research interests of Andreas Seidel-Morgenstern include heterogeneous catalysis, adsorption and preparative chromatography, crystallization and the development of new reactor concepts. The results of his work are published in more than 400 research papers. Andreas Seidel- Morgenstern received the Max Buchner Award of DECHEMA (2000), holds Honorary Doctorates of the University of Southern Denmark (Odense, Denmark) and the Lappeenranta University of Technology (Finland). He is Member of the Berlin- Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities (BBAW) and the German National Academy of Science and Engineering (acatech). == Major research interests Research Group of Andreas Seidel-Morgenstern at MPI Magdeburg== *New Reactor Concepts *Chromatographic Reactors *Membrane Reactors *Heterogeneous catalysis *Adsorption and Preparative chromatography *Crystallization *Separation of Enantiomers == Awards & honors (selection) == {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !style=\"width:20%\" data-sort-type=\"number\" | Jahr !style=\"width:80%\" class=\"unsortable\" |Position |- | data-sort-value=\"2016\" |2016 - | Vice- President of the International Adsorption Society (IAS) |- | 2015 | Humanity in Science Award, granted by Phenomenex and The Analytical ScientistWebsite Humanity in Science Award |- | data-sort-value=\"2013\" |2013 - | Member of Editorial Board of \"Adsorption\" (Springer US) |- | data-sort-value=\"2012\" |2012 - | Member of the German National Academy of Science and Engineering \"Acatech\" |- | 2012 | Honorary Doctorate \u201eDoctor technices h.c.\u201c at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU, Odense, Denmark) |- | data-sort- value=\"2010\" |2010 - | Member of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities |- | data-sort-value=\"2010\" |2010 - | Member of Board of Directors of the International Adsorption Society (IAS) |- | data-sort- value=\"2008\" |2008 - 2014 | Member of \"Commission for the Collaborative Research Centers\" (German Science Foundation, DFG) |- | 2008 | Honorary Doctorate \u201eScience in Technology\u201d at the Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT, Lappeenranta, Finland)Press release Informationsdienst Wissenschaft (in German) |- | data-sort-value=\"2007\" |2007 - | Member of Editorial Board of the \"Chemical Engineering Journal\" (Elsevier, Amsterdam) |- | data-sort- value=\"2006\" |2006 - | Member of Working Party \"Chemical Reaction Engineering\" (European Federation of Chemical Engineering, EFCE) |- | data-sort- value=\"2005\" |2005 - | Member of Board of Trustees of the Journals \"Chemical Engineering & Technology\" and \"Chemie Ingenieurtechnik\" (Wiley-VCH, Weinheim) |- | data-sort-value=\"2003\" |2003 - 2008 | Elected member of Board of Reviewers of the German Science Foundation for the fields of \"Chemical and Thermal Process Engineering\" |- | 2002 | Otto von Guericke Research Award of Otto von Guericke University MagdeburgPress release of Otto von Guericke University (in German) |- | data-sort-value=\"2001\" |2001 - | Member of International Editorial Board of \"Journal of Chromatography A\" (Elsevier, Amsterdam) |- | data-sort-value=\"2001\" |2001 - | Member of Board of Trustees of Ernest Solvay Foundation, Hanover |- | 1999 | Max Buchner Award of Dechema e.V.Article of prozesstechnik-online (in German) |- | data-sort-value=\"1999\" |1999 - | Member of Otto von Guericke Society, Magdeburg |- | data-sort- value=\"1998\" |1998 - | Member of Board of \u201cTechnical Reactions\u201d (DECHEMA e.V., Frankfurt/M.) |- | data-sort-value=\"1998\" |1998 - 2002: | External Scientific Member of the Max Planck Society at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems, Magdeburg |- | data-sort-value=\"1992\" |1992 - 1994: | Grant of German Science Foundation (DFG) to support Habilitation |- | data- sort-value=\"1991\" |1991 - 1992: | Grant of the Scientific Council of NATO to support a Post-Doc stay in the USA |} == Publications (selection) == Journal and Book Contributions, Patents == External links == * Website at Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems * Website at Otto-von- Guericke University Magdeburg (in German) == References == Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:People from Mittweida Category:People from Bezirk Karl-Marx-Stadt Category:German chemical engineers Category:Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg faculty Category:Engineers from Saxony ",
