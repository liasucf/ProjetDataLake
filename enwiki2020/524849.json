    "text": "The voiceless alveolar lateral fricative is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents voiceless dental, alveolar, and postalveolar lateral fricatives is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is `[K]`. The symbol is called \"belted l\" and should not be confused with \"l with tilde\", , which transcribes a different sound, the velarized alveolar lateral approximant. It should also be distinguished from a voiceless alveolar lateral approximant, although the fricative is sometimes incorrectly described as a \"voiceless l\", a description fitting only of the approximant. Several Welsh names beginning with this sound (e.g. Llwyd , Llywelyn ) have been borrowed into English, where they either retain the Welsh spelling but are pronounced with an (Lloyd, Llewellyn), or are substituted with (pronounced ) (Floyd, Fluellen). == Features == Features of the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative: == Occurrence == Although the sound is rare among European languages outside the Caucasus (being found notably in Welsh, where it is written ), it is fairly common among indigenous languages of the Americas such as Nahuatl, Navajo, and North Caucasian languages, such as Avar. It is also found in African languages like Zulu, Asian languages like Chukchi and some Yue dialects like Taishanese, and several Formosan languages and a number of dialects in Taiwan. The sound is found in two of the constructed languages invented by J. R. R. Tolkien, Sindarin (inspired by Welsh) and Quenya (inspired by Finnish, Ancient Greek, and Latin). In Sindarin it is written as initially and medially and finally; in Quenya it only appears initially and is written . === Dental or denti- alveolar === {| class=\"wikitable\" !colspan=2| Language !
