Stretching approximately from Aved\u00f8re in the south to Utterslev Mose in the north, it is part of the last generation of land fortifications of the city. Built in the period 1888\u20131892 by up to 2,000 workers, it was the largest construction project of its time in Denmark. Vestvolden was divided into two fortifications end to end, the southern one named Vestenceinten and the northern, much shorter one named Husumenceinten; the name Vestvolden emerged as an informal collective term for the two. The building of this fortification system began during the so-called \"Provisorietiden\" (the Provisional Time) 1885\u20131894.
