Launched in 1902 it was the world's largest yacht built at the time. The yacht was mainly a pleasure craft, but did participate in races. She was christened by the daughter of US President Theodore Roosevelt, who was in attendance with Prince Henry of Prussia and two thousand spectators. The yacht had a 40-year career with twelve owners, some of who upgraded the yacht. She was requisitioned by the United States Navy during World War II for service and became the property of the United States government. Ultimately the yacht was sold out for scrap. == History == Meteor III, designed by naval architect Archibald Cary Smith, was an improved and enlarged version of the yacht Yampa which was originally built by Smith for Chester W. Chapin, a United States Congressman from Massachusetts. Yampa had several owners and was eventually purchased by the German emperor. It was renamed Iduna and participated in European regattas. The emperor was so pleased with the performance of Iduna that he placed an order with Smith for the construction of a larger and improved version. The new schooner yacht was named Meteor III following the scheme the emperor had of naming his pleasure craft, as she was the next sequenced Meteor. Meteor III was built by Townsend-Downey Shipbuilding Company at Shooters Island in New York City and launched February 25, 1902. It took four months to construct from Smith's architectural drawings. Alice Roosevelt, US President Theodore Rooselvelt's 18 year old daughter, christened the yacht upon launch. The emperor's younger brother, Prince Henry, traveled from Europe to New York City to attend as the German emperor's personal representative. Two thousand spectators were at the 10:30 a.m. launching including President Roosevelt and Prince Henry. Alice Roosevelt breaking a champagne bottle upon launching of Meteor III yacht Alice christened the schooner by breaking a bottle of champagne against the steel side of the yacht. She proclaimed in a loud clear voice, I christen thee Meteor. Up to that point the yacht was just labeled job No. 24 by the shipyard. Alice then cut the holding cord to a key block of weights that held the yacht in place on the dock support cradle, using a silver-looking nickel hatchet. Cannons were fired, brass bands played and there was a twenty-one gun salute. Alice struck the bow of the yacht with her palm as it started moving into the water leaving its supports. President Roosevelt and Prince Henry followed her example. Nearby German officers did the same, with some nearly being knocked off their feet as the yacht was picking up speed. Immediately after the yacht was launched into the water, a message was cabled to Berlin from Prince Henry to the emperor saying, Yacht just launched under brilliant auspices. Christened by Miss Roosevelt's hand. Beautiful craft. Great enthusiasm. I congratulate you \u2013 Heinrich. Meteor III yacht leaving the slip way after christening by Alice Roosevelt. In 1909, Meteor III was put up for sale by the emperor. She eventually was sold to professor Carl Harries of the University of Kiel. She was renamed Nordstern and took part in the Kiel Regatta. Harries put the yacht up for sale in 1921 in Barcelona, Spain. It was bought by Maurice Bunau-Varilla, owner of the Paris newspaper Le Matin. In 1924 Bunau-Varilla sold Meteor III to Italian baron Alberto Fassini. In 1932 Fassini sold the vessel to a Mr. Gillet, who turned her over to Camper and Nicholsons, British yacht brokers. After being on the market for awhile she was sold to the American Francis Lenn Taylor, father of Elizabeth Taylor. Taylor used her for several years as a pleasure craft. He then sold her to Sterling Hayden. It was later repossessed because Hayden defaulted on the financial arrangements. In 1940 Taylor then resold her to Gerald S. Foley who later sold her to a Mr. David Feinburg, who sold her to Nicholas Allen. The last owner gave the schooner yacht the name Aldabaran. The United States Navy requisitioned her during World War II for service and the craft became the property of the War Shipping Administration (WSA). The yacht had ultimately passed through twelve owners, some of who updated the yacht. The vessel during this time had received new engines, radio equipment and a third mast. The yacht at one time was used as a fishing vessel. In 1942 she was taken to Shooters Island by the WSA since they then owned her. Aldabaran, previously the German emperor's Meteor III, in 1945 was sold for $2,100 to John Witte, an iron salvager at Staten Island who did business a short distance from where Meteor III was originally constructed in 1902. Witte then took the craft apart for scrap iron. == Description == Meteor III (circa 1902) was based on the Yampa design. Meteor III had a overall length of with on the water line and a width of .
