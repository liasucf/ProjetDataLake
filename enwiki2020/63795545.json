Walburn was historically a township in the parish of Downholme in the wapentake of Hang West in the North Riding of Yorkshire. From 1286 Walburn was held of the manor of Thornton Steward, whose lords were mesne tenants of the honour of Richmond. Walburn became a separate civil parish in 1866. In 1974 it was transferred to the new county of North Yorkshire. == Walburn Hall == Walburn Hall is a fortified house probably dating from the 12th century but much altered in the 15th and 16th centuries. It is a Grade I listed building, now used as a farmhouse. ==References== ==External links== Category:Villages in North Yorkshire Category:Civil parishes in North Yorkshire ",
