    "text": "The Tuolumne Meadows Ranger Station and Comfort Stations are examples of National Park Service Rustic design in Yosemite National Park. They are within the Tuolumne Meadows Historic District at Tuolumne Meadows. The ranger station was built in 1924 using peeled log construction. The ranger station doubled as the park entrance station for the Tioga Road. Its function was partly superseded by a newer structure in 1936, using larger quantities of stonework. ==Later structures== Later structures, such as the comfort station or public toilet, was designed by the National Park Service Branch of Plans and Designs and was built by Civilian Conservation Corps labor. Other structures, including bunk houses and mess halls were built in the Tuolumne Meadows Historic District at the same time to similar design standards. The original CCC mess hall, built in 1934, has become the Tuolumne Meadows Visitor Center.
