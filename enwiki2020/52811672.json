    "text": "The Carnegie-Stout Public Library is located in Dubuque, Iowa, United States. The public library had its beginnings with the Young Men's Literary Association, established in 1859, and their book collection was the basis for the library's collection. with The books were housed in a variety of buildings over the years. The community applied for a grant from Andrew Carnegie who on January 12, 1901 contributed $71,500 to build the library building. Local businessman Frank D. Stout donated the property, which was worth $20,000, in honor of his father Henry L. Stout. The two-story Bedford stone and brick building was designed by Chicago architects W. G. Williamson and John Spencer. It is considered one of the finest examples of the Classical tradition of Beaux-Arts architecture in Iowa. The main facade is dominated by a Roman Corinthian portico that was modeled after the Pantheon in Rome. Its fluted columns are matched with pilasters on the wall behind. The building was dedicated on October 17, 1902, and it opened three days later. It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, and it was included as a contributing property in the Jackson Park Historic District in 1986. with An addition was added to the east side of the building in 1981. ==References== Category:Library buildings completed in 1902 Category:Public libraries in Iowa Category:Carnegie libraries in Iowa Category:Beaux-Arts architecture in Iowa Category:Buildings and structures in Dubuque, Iowa Category:National Register of Historic Places in Dubuque, Iowa Category:Libraries on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa Category:Individually listed contributing properties to historic districts on the National Register in Iowa Category:Historic district contributing properties in Iowa ",
