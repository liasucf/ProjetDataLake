It is based in the Metzudat Ze'ev offices on King George Street in Tel Aviv. ==History== Early Mishkei Herut Beitar settlements were established by members of the Platoon of the Wall brigade of Beitar. The first was Ramat Tyomkin (now part of Netanya) in 1932, followed by Tel Tzur near Zikhron Ya'akov. The movement was affiliated with the Herut party,Meron Benvenisti (1986) The West Bank Handbook, The Jerusalem Post, p105 which later merged into Likud. Due to ideological differences with other settlements, most of which were affiliated with Labor Zionism, in one case a separate regional council, Alona, was created for the three Herut Beitar settlements in Haifa District.S.
