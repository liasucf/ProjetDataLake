    "text": "Leonardo Enrique Villalba (born 29 November 1994) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a winger for Greek club Lamia. ==Club career== V\u00e9lez Sarsfield signed Villalba in 2009. His first appearance in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n arrived on 11 May 2013 against Arsenal de Sarand\u00ed, with Ricardo Gareca substituting him on for the final six minutes of a 2\u20132 draw. He was selected a further twenty-one times in the next three seasons in all competitions, with Villalba also netting his opening goal versus La Emilia in the Copa Argentina in April 2015. In the following July, Villalba was loaned to Super League Greece side Panionios. He remained for the entirety of 2015\u201316, making his debut in a victory over Panathinaikos in September before scoring against Panetolikos in October. After twenty-six matches in Greek football, Villalba returned to his homeland with Primera B Nacional's Douglas Haig, on loan, in July 2016. Seven goals, which included a brace of Santamarina, occurred despite the club suffering relegation. Ahead of 2017\u201318, Villalba switched V\u00e9lez Sarsfield for Flandria. He made his bow in a fixture with Juventud Unida on 17 September 2017. Eleven months later, in mid-2018, Villalba moved to the Primera Divisi\u00f3n's Defensa y Justicia. However, he was immediately loaned down to the second tier with Sarmiento. He scored three goals in his first fifteen games for the team from Jun\u00edn. ==International career== In 2011, Villalba won six caps for Argentina at the South American U-17 Championship in Ecuador; as his nation finished third. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"7\"|V\u00e9lez Sarsfield |2012\u201313 |rowspan=\"6\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- |2013\u201314 |4||0||0||0||2Appearance(s) in the Copa Libertadores||0||0||0||6||0 |- |2014 |5||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||5||0 |- |2015 |8||0||1||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1Appearance(s) in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n play- offs||0||10||1 |- |2016 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |2016\u201317 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !18!!0!!1!!1!!2!!0!!1!!0!!22!!1 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Panionios (loan) |2015\u201316 |rowspan=\"1\"|Superleague Greece |17||1||5||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||4Appearance(s) in the Super League play-offs||0||26||1 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Douglas Haig (loan) |2016\u201317 |rowspan=\"2\"|Primera B Nacional |30||7||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||31||7 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Flandria |2017\u201318 |12||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||12||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Defensa y Justicia |2018\u201319 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Sarmiento (loan) |2018\u201319 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera B Nacional |18||3||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||18||3 |- |Lamia |2019\u201320 |Superleague Greece |8 |1 |2 |1 | | | | |10 |2 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Career total !104!!12!!9!!2!!2!!0!!5!!0!!120!!14 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:People from Formosa Province Category:Argentine footballers Category:Argentina youth international footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Argentine expatriate footballers Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Super League Greece players Category:Primera B Nacional players Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico V\u00e9lez Sarsfield footballers Category:Panionios F.C. players Category:Douglas Haig footballers Category:Flandria footballers Category:Defensa y Justicia footballers Category:PAS Lamia 1964 players Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Sarmiento footballers Category:Central C\u00f3rdoba de Santiago del Estero footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Greece Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Greece ",
