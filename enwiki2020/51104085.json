    "text": "Progress MS-08 (), identified by NASA as Progress 69P, is a Progress spacecraft used by Roscosmos to resupply the International Space Station (ISS). == History == The Progress-MS is a uncrewed freighter based on the Progress-M featuring improved avionics. This improved variant first launched on 21 December 2015. It has the following improvements: * New external compartment that enables it to deploy satellites. Each compartment can hold up to four launch containers. First time installed on Progress MS-03. * Enhanced redundancy thanks to the addition of a backup system of electrical motors for the docking and sealing mechanism. * Improved Micrometeoroid (MMOD) protection with additional panels in the cargo compartment. * Luch Russian relay satellites link capabilities enable telemetry and control even when not in direct view of ground radio stations. * GNSS autonomous navigation enables real time determination of the status vector and orbital parameters dispensing with the need of ground station orbit determination. * Real time relative navigation thanks to direct radio data exchange capabilities with the space station. * New digital radio that enables enhanced TV camera view for the docking operations. * The Ukrainian Chezara Kvant-V on board radio system and antenna/feeder system has been replaced with a Unified Command Telemetry System (UCTS). * Replacement of the Kurs A with Kurs NA digital system. ==Launch== Progress MS-08 launched on 13 February 2018 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan atop a Soyuz-2.1a rocket, at 08:13:33 UTC. ==Docking== Progress MS-08 docked on 15 February 2018 with the aft docking port of the Zvezda module, at 10:38 UTC. == Cargo == The Progress MS-08 spacecraft delivered 2,494 kg of cargo and supplies to the International Space Station. The following is a breakdown of cargo bound for the ISS: * Dry cargo: 1,390 kg * Fuel: 890 kg * Oxygen and Air: 46 kg * Water: 430 kg Progress MS-08 also includes two nanosatellites: Tanyusha YuZGU-3 (1998-067PJ) and Tanyusha YuZGU-4 (1998-067PK) (a.k.a. Radioskaf RS-8 and Radioskaf RS-9) with a mass of 2.5 kg, which was developed jointly by RKK Energia and students at the South- Western State University, YuZGU, in the city of Kursk. The satellites will be launched by spacewalking cosmonauts. ==Undocking and decay== Undocking on 23 August 2018, at 02:16 UTC. And decay in the atmosphere and its debris entered the Pacific Ocean, on 30 August 2018. ==References== Category:Progress (spacecraft) missions Category:Spacecraft launched in 2018 Category:2018 in Russia Category:Supply vehicles for the International Space Station Category:Spacecraft launched by Soyuz-2 rockets Category:Spacecraft which reentered in 2018 ",
