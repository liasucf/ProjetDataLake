    "text": "Jacke wie Hose (English-language title: Swings Or RoundaboutsJacke wie Hose on the DEFA Foundation website.) is an East German comedy film, directed by Eduard Kubat. It was released in 1953. ==Plot== After a new government law forbids women to operate heavy machinery in steel factories, a group of female workers that is determined to lift the ban proposes a competition to their male counterparts: those who will produce the greatest quantity of steel will win. The men are certain that they will be victorious. One of them, Ernst Hollup, is angered by his wife's involvement with the other team, and he demands that she will resign and become a housewife. The women develop a wagon that carries the molten iron to the steel furnace and greatly simplifies their work. They win the competition, as well as the respect of the men. The government lifts the ban. ==Cast== *Irene Korb as Hilde Hollup *G\u00fcnther Simon as Ernst Hollup *Fritz Diez as Hellwand *Johanna Bucher as Manja *Ruth Maria Kubitschek as Eva *Charlotte K\u00fcter as Johanna *Regine Lutz as Lisa *Lieselotte Merbach as Zenzi *Wolfgang Erich Parge as Triebel *Herbert Richter as Meider *Theo Shall as M\u00fchlberger *Edwin Marian as Peter *Harry Hindemith as Steiger ==Production== The film was planned after the East German public reacted negatively to the wave of highly ideological films released during the early 1950s. It was intended to present the ideas of socialism in a humorous fashion, and to provide entertainment for the audience. ==Reception== East German film critic Leo Menter wrote that \"Jacke wie Hose is a typical example for the films made in the peace-loving, Socialist countries... it is no gangster film, no opium for the masses; it is based on true life.\"Presse-und Informationsamt, Bundesrepublik Deutschland.
