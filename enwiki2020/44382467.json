(1872) Luis \u00c1lvarez Catal\u00e1 (1836 - 4 October 1901) was a Spanish painter of historical scenes and Director of the Museo del Prado from 1898 to 1901. == Biography == He is believed to have been born in Madrid, to an Asturian family from Cangas de Narcea, where he spent the summer seasons during his childhood. After finishing his primary education in Oviedo, he returned to Madrid, where he enrolled in the \"Escuela Especial de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado\" and was a student of Federico de Madrazo at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando.Biography @ the Museo del Prado website. In 1857, he won a scholarship to study in Rome, together with Eduardo Rosales, Vicente Palmaroli and Di\u00f3scoro Puebla. After four years there, he won a Gold Medal at the first National Exposition of Florence for his painting Calpurnia's Dream, which took second place at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts of Spain in 1862. Queen Isabel II bought the painting and his scholarship was extended for three years. He was married in Rome, and ultimately remained there until 1894, with brief stays in Madrid. He continued to exhibit widely in Italy, Spain and Germany, winning awards in 1889 and 1890. Finally, he returned to Spain to accept the position of Deputy Director at the Museo del Prado and, four years later, was appointed Director by the Queen, following the resignation of Francisco Pradilla. His new Deputy was Salvador Viniegra. During his administration, he made several important acquisitions, including several works by Francisco de Goya. In 1899, he produced a Cat\u00e1logo ilustrado de la sala de Vel\u00e1zquez (Illustrated catalog of the Vel\u00e1zquez collection) and oversaw the installation of a statue of Vel\u00e1zquez by Aniceto Marinas. He also continued to paint, mainly producing works in the costumbrista style. In his last years, he created scenes inspired by his youth in Northern Spain, many of which are now at the Museum of Fine Arts of Asturias. He died in Madrid. == Selected works == File:The Flower Shop by Luis \u00c1lvarez Catal\u00e1.jpg|The Flower Shop File:Princess Borghese Bestowing Dowries by Luis \u00c1lvarez Catal\u00e1.jpg|Princess Borghese Bestowing Dowries File:The Unveiling by Luis \u00c1lvarez Catal\u00e1.jpg|The Unveiling File:Dressing for the Ball by Luis \u00c1lvarez Catal\u00e1.jpg|Dressing for the Ball File:La modelo del artista, por Luis \u00c1lvarez Catal\u00e1.jpg|The Artist's Model File:The Suitor by Luis \u00c1lvarez Catal\u00e1.jpg|The Suitor File:Woman Before a Mirror by Luis \u00c1lvarez Catal\u00e1.jpg|Woman Before a Mirror File:Admirando el Cuadro por Luis \u00c1lvarez Catal\u00e1.jpg|Admiring the Painting File:Indiscretion by Luis \u00c1lvarez Catal\u00e1.jpg|Indiscretion File:The Flirtation by Luis \u00c1lvarez Catal\u00e1.jpg|The Flirtation ==References== ==Further reading== * Javier Bar\u00f3n et al., Cartas del pintor Luis \u00c1lvarez Catal\u00e1 a Nicol\u00e1s Su\u00e1rez Cant\u00f3n, Real Instituto de Estudios Asturianos, 2004 == External links == * ArtNet: More works by \u00c1lvarez Catal\u00e1 Category:1836 births Category:1901 deaths Category:Directors of the Museo del Prado Category:19th-century Spanish painters Category:Spanish male painters Category:Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando alumni ",
