    "text": "St. Brigid's Cathedral, Kildare The Bishop of Kildare was an episcopal title which took its name after the town of Kildare in County Kildare, Ireland. The title is no longer in use by any of the main Christian churches having been united with other bishoprics. In the Roman Catholic Church, the title has been merged with that of the bishopric of Leighlin and is currently held by the Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin. In the Church of Ireland, the title has been merged with that of the bishopric of Meath and is currently held by the Bishop of Meath and Kildare. ==History== In the 5th century, the Abbey of Kildare was founded by Saint Brigid, a double monastery of nuns and monks. The abbey was governed by an abbess, who was the 'heir of Brigit' (comarbae Brigte), and by abbots, bishops and abbot-bishops, who were subordinate to the abbess. Although the bishopric was founded with the abbey in the fifth-century, it wasn't until 1111 AD that the diocese of Kildare was established at the Synod of Rathbreasail. The diocese covered roughly the northern part of County Kildare and the eastern part of County Offaly. After the episcopate of Walter Wellesley (1529\u20131539), there were parallel apostolic successions. In the Church of Ireland, Kildare continued as an independent diocese until 1846 when it amalgamated with Dublin and Glendalough to form the united Diocese of Dublin, Kildare and Glendalough. In 1976, Kildare broke away from Dublin and Glendalough and combined with Meath to form the current united Diocese of Meath and Kildare. The Roman Catholic bishopric of Kildare too remained separate until it linked with the bishopric of Leighlin. The bishops of Kildare had been apostolic administrators of Leighlin since 1683 and the union of the two sees was formally decreed on 29 November 1694. ==Pre-Reformation bishops== ===Monastic bishops of Kildare=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" !style=\"background- color:#FABE60\" colspan=\"5\"|Monastic Bishops of Kildare |- align=center ! style=\"background-color:#ffffec\" width=\"20%\"|Tenure ! style=\"background- color:#ffffec\" width=\"30%\"|Incumbent ! style=\"background-color:#ffffec\" width=\"45%\"|Notes |-valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\" |align=center|d. 520 |Conl\u00e1ed ua hEimri |Known as Saint Conleth;
