The faculty is spread across the Ulster University at Belfast, Coleraine and Magee campus' of the University. The Faculty represents the university as a member of the Engineering Professors Council (EPC), which is the representative body for Engineering in UK higher education. ==Schools== ===School of Computing and Information Engineering=== The Ulster University School of Computing and Information Engineering (shortened to SCIE) is physically located at the Coleraine campus of Ulster University, in Coleraine, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. ===School of Computing and Intelligent Systems=== The Ulster University School of Computing and Intelligent Systems (shortened to SCIS) is physically located at Magee College of the Ulster University, in Derry, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. SCIS focuses on teaching and research in the main areas of computer science, games, electronics, robotics and multimedia. It currently offers five main undergraduate bachelor's degree programmes in the above areas and three one-year taught postgraduate masters degrees in the areas of creative technologies, intelligent systems and financial services. PhD research opportunities are also available through the research graduate school. ====History==== SCIS was formed in 2001 through a merger of the School of Computing and Mathematics and School of Engineering on the Magee campus. Professor Martin McGinnity was the first Head of School (HOS) (2001-2005) and he has since moved on to become Director of the Intelligent Systems Research Centre. Professor Liam Maguire is the current HOS (2005 to date). His inaugural professorial lecture took place in March 2009 to an invited audience.UU Press Office Website Spiking Up Computational Intelligence.
