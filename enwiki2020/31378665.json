    "text": "The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) is a geocode standard by Eurostat for referencing the subdivisions of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for statistical purposes. The NUTS code for the UK is UK and there are 12 first level regions within the State. As a country of the UK, there are 9 such regions in England. The standard is developed and regulated by the European Union (EU). The NUTS standard is instrumental in delivering the EU's Structural Funds. A hierarchy of three levels is established by Eurostat. The sub-structure corresponds to administrative divisions within the country. Formerly, the further NUTS divisions IV and V existed; these have now been replaced by Local Administrative Units (LAU-1 and LAU-2 respectively). Between 1994 and 2011, the nine regions had an administrative role in the implementation of UK Government policy, and as the areas covered by (mostly indirectly) elected bodies. ==List of regions== The NUTS 1 statistical regions correspond with the regions of England as used by the UK's Office for National Statistics.United Kingdom, NUTS 2013, NUTS Maps, Eurostat.

South West Greater London has a directly elected Mayor and Assembly. The other eight regions have Local authority leaders' boards, which have a role in coordinating local government on a regional level, with members appointed by local government bodies. These boards replaced indirectly elected regional assemblies, which were established in 1994 and undertook a range of co- ordinating, lobbying, scrutiny and strategic planning functions until their abolition. ==Sub-structure of the regions== Each region of England is divided into a range of metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties. For NUTS purposes, these subdivisions are formally known as NUTS levels 2 and 3. * London region is divided into :: London boroughs (NUTS 3, usual grouped) * All other regions are divided into :: metropolitan counties (NUTS 2) :: shire counties (NUTS 2 or 3 depending on the region) and :: unitary authorities (usually NUTS 3). ==See also== * Regions of England * Historical and alternative regions of England * NUTS statistical regions of the United Kingdom * List of articles about local government in the United Kingdom * Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics == References == == External links == *Local Government Boundary Commission for England *Dept of Communities and Local Government England Category:Regionalism (politics) in the United Kingdom Category:Types of subdivision in the United Kingdom ",
