It was established in 2013 under the name CIWA (Council of Informal Workers Associations) which was later changed to UNIWA in recognition of its status as a trade union. It is affiliated with the Trade Union Congress of Ghana.http://www.ghanatuc.org/aboutus.html The informal sector is a large part of the Ghanaian economy. It contributes around 40.6% to the GDP of Ghana and around 90% of the workforce is employed in the informal sector. The nature of the informal economy entails that workers in the sector are often vulnerable to exploitation.http://www.fesghana.org/index.php?page=informal-economy UNIWA was therefore set up as a way of organizing informal workers to protect their rights. ==Aims== The aim of UNIWA is to organise informal workers into trade unions in order to promote their common interest and strengthen their bargaining power vis-\u00e0-vis the government and employers.
