    "text": "Robert Louis Buchanan (born 1957) is a Canadian keyboardist, songwriter, arranger, and producer. Buchanan, who hails from Vancouver, began playing the piano at age six. He acquired his first paying gig as a pianist at age twelve playing six nights a week in Dawson City, Yukon. While still a teenager, Buchanan joined a band called Soul Unlimited, at the suggestion of friend Tom Baird. In the years that followed, Buchanan eventually moved to Los Angeles, California to write music with Carl Graves. In 1978, Buchanan played a piano player in the Bette Midler film, The Rose. Buchanan would also go on to tour with Midler in support of the film. After a short period in 1980 playing with the Maxus band, Buchanan decided to turn his attention to being a full-time session keyboardist. From that point on, his compositions and piano skills have earned him credits on albums by many musicians. Buchanan makes his home in Vancouver for three months of the year, and Los Angeles for the remainder. ==Discography== * Born To Love: Peabo Bryson and Roberta Flack (EMI 1983) arranger and synthesizer: \"Comin' Alive\" ==Filmography== *Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) arranger: \"Beauty and the Beast (End Title Duet)\" (1991) *Aladdin (1992 Disney film) arranger: \"A Whole New World (Aladdin's Theme)\" (1992) *The Swan Princess arranger: \"Far Longer Than Forever\" (End Title Version) / producer: \"Far Longer Than Forever\" (End Title Version) (1994) *Pocahontas (1995 film) arranger: \"Colors of the Wind\" (1995), \"If I Never Knew You\" (1995) / producer: \"If I Never Knew You\" (1995) *Atlantis: The Lost Empire producer: \"Where the Dreams Take You\" (2001) *Lady and the Tramp 2: Scamp's Adventure arranger: \"Bella Notte (End Title Version)\" / producer: \"Bella Notte (End Title Version)\" (2001) ==External links== * * * Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian record producers Category:Canadian session musicians Category:Canadian songwriters Category:Musicians from Vancouver Category:Writers from Vancouver Category:20th-century Canadian keyboardists Category:21st-century Canadian keyboardists ",
