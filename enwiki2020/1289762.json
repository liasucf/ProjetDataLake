    "text": "A referendum on whether Norway should join the European Community was held on 25 September 1972. After a long period of heated debate, the \"No\" side won with 53.5 per cent of the vote. Prime Minister Trygve Bratteli resigned as a result of the defeat. This was Norway's second attempt at becoming a member, after having been rejected by France in 1962 and again temporarily in 1967, but the first attempt with a referendum on a set of fully negotiated accession terms. A 1994 referendum on entry into what had become the European Union also resulted in the rejection of membership. ==Result== ===Countrywide=== ===By constituency=== thumb|Results by county. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Constituency !Electorate !Spoilt votes !Total poll (%) !For (%) !Against (%) |- |\u00d8stfold | |392 | | | |- |Akershus | |542 | | | |- |Oslo | |619 | | | |- |Hedmark | |519 | | | |- |Oppland | |314 | | | |- |Buskerud | |400 | | | |- |Vestfold | |247 | | | |- |Telemark | |211 | | | |- |Aust-Agder | |138 | | | |- |Vest-Agder | |177 | | | |- |Rogaland | |309 | | | |- |Hordaland | |511 | | | |- |Sogn og Fjordane | |153 | | | |- |M\u00f8re og Romsdal | |240 | | | |- |S\u00f8r- Tr\u00f8ndelag | |248 | | | |- |Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag | |107 | | | |- |Nordland | |549 | | | |- |Troms | |385 | | | |- |Finnmark | |327 | | | |} ==References== Category:Referendums in Norway Category:1972 referendums Category:1972 in Norway Category:Referendums related to European Union accession Category:1972 elections in Europe Category:1972 in international relations Category:1972 in the European Economic Community Category:Norway\u2013European Union relations Category:September 1972 events in Europe ",
