She twice more failed to pass the test during the series, as well as the much easier written exam known in the UK as the theory test.Choose a car The Telegraph interview with Maureen Rees Maureen's memorable moments include moving into the overtaking lane of a dual carriageway in the path of an overtaking car, and accidentally running over husband Dave's foot. She eventually passed in the last episode in an automatic, though after the series finished she passed a manual test. Maureen became quite a celebrity and even released a single: her cover of Madness' \"Driving in My Car\" reached #50 in the UK Singles Chart, and fronted a government awareness campaign to increase road awareness. ==Others== Teenager Danny wanted to pass his test so he could visit his girlfriend in Preston. Although he passed first time, he had already broken up with Jill. An older lady called Joan passed her test at the beginning of the series h (even though it took her a while to realise that she needed to put the car in Drive before the car would move), but had \"lost her nerve\" and needed lessons to rebuild her confidence.

The Andy1st driving school was also featured. ==Celebrity Driving School== A four-part celebrity version was produced in 2003 in aid of Comic Relief.
