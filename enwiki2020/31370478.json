Reference: Catalog State Archives Darmstadt === The inheritance === As Charlotte Christine died before her father, her son, the future Landgrave Louis IX, became heir apparent of the County of Hanau. This was, however, restricted to the Lichtenberg part of the county, because the M\u00fcnzenberg part of the county had been awarded to the county of Hesse-Kassel in an earlier inheritance contract between Hanau and Hesse-Kassel. A dispute arose, because it wasn't clear to which part the district of Babenhausen would belong. It escalated into a military conflict. Hesse-Darmstadt occupied Dietzenbach, Schaafheim and ; Hesse-Kassel occupied the rest of the district of Babenhausen, deploying troops that had already been stationed in Hanau. The dispute could be settled only after protracted litigation before the highest courts of the Empire, which in 1771 issued the so-called Partifikationsrezess. The towns of , Dietzenbach, , Schaafheim and Schlierbach were awarded to Hesse-Darmstadt and were incorporated into the district Schaafheim. == Ancestors == == References == * Alfred B\u00f6rckel: Wives of the princes of Hesse from St. Elizabeth to the present day, represented in their life and work, 2nd ed.
