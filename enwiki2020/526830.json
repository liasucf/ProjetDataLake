    "text": "This is a list of cruisers of the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom from 1877 (when the category was created by amalgamating the two previous categories of frigate and corvette) until the last cruiser was decommissioned more than a century later. There are no longer any cruisers in the Royal Navy. == First class cruisers == Armoured cruisers were protected by a belt of side armour and an armoured deck. In the Royal Navy this classification was not actually used, the term first class cruiser being used instead for both armoured cruisers and large protected cruisers. Thus, the first class cruisers built between the Orlando class (1886) and the Cressy class (1897) were, strictly speaking, protected cruisers as they lacked an armoured belt. The first class cruiser was succeeded by the Battlecruiser in the Royal Navy. * Shannon first class armoured cruiser, (1875) 5,670 tons, 2-10in, 7-9in ** Shannon (1875) \u2013 Sold 1899 * Nelson class first class armoured cruiser, 7,473 tons, 4-10in, 6-9in ** Nelson (1876) \u2013 Sold 1910 ** Northampton (1876) \u2013 Sold 1905 * Imperieuse class first class armoured cruiser, 8,500 tons, 4-9.2in, 10-6in ** Imperieuse (1883) \u2013 Sold 1913 ** Warspite (1884) \u2013 Sold 1905 * Orlando class first class armoured cruiser, 5,600 tons, 2-9.2in, 10-6in ** Orlando (1886) \u2013 Sold 1905 ** Australia (1886) \u2013 Sold 1905 ** Undaunted (1886) \u2013 Sold 1907 ** Narcissus (1886) \u2013 Sold 1906 ** Galatea (1887) \u2013 Sold 1905 ** Immortalite (1887) \u2013 Sold 1907 ** Aurora (1887) \u2013 Sold 1907 * Blake class first class protected cruiser, 9,150 tons, 2-9.2in, 10-6in ** Blake (1889) \u2013 Sold 1922 ** Blenheim (1890) \u2013 Sold 1926 * Edgar class first class protected cruiser, 7,700 tons, 2-9.2in, 10-6in ** Edgar (1890) ** Hawke (1891) \u2013 Torpedoed 1914 ** Endymion (1891) ** Royal Arthur (1891) ** Gibraltar (1892) \u2013 Sold 1923 ** Grafton (1892) ** St George (1892) ** Theseus (1892) ** Crescent (1892) * Powerful class first class protected cruiser, 14,200 tons, 2-9.2in, 12-6in ** Powerful (1895) \u2013 Sold 1929 ** Terrible (1895) \u2013 Sold 1932 * Diadem class first class protected cruiser, 11,000 tons, 16-6in ** Diadem (1896) ** Niobe (1897) \u2013 To Canada as HMCS Niobe, BU 1922 ** Europa (1897) ** Andromeda (1897) ** Amphitrite (1898) ** Argonaut (1898) ** Ariadne (1898) ** Spartiate (1898) * Cressy class first class armoured cruiser, 12,000 tons, 2-9.2in, 12-6in ** Cressy (1899) \u2013 Torpedoed 1914 ** Sutlej (1899) ** Aboukir (1900) \u2013 Torpedoed 1914 ** Hogue (1900) \u2013 Torpedoed 1914 ** Bacchante (1901) ** Euryalus (1901) * Drake class first class armoured cruiser, 14,150 tons, 2-9.2in, 16-6in ** Drake (1901) \u2013 Torpedoed 1917 ** Good Hope (ex-Africa) (1901) \u2013 Sunk during the Battle of Coronel, 1914 ** King Alfred (1901) \u2013 Sold 1920 ** Leviathan (1901) \u2013 Sold 1920 * Monmouth class first class armoured cruiser, 9,800 tons, 14-6in ** Monmouth (1901) \u2013 Sunk during the Battle of Coronel, 1914 ** Bedford (1901) \u2013 Wrecked on 21 August 1910 off Quelport Island in the China Sea ** Essex (1901) ** Kent (1901) ** Berwick (1902) ** Cornwall (1902) ** Cumberland (1902) ** Donegal (1902) ** Lancaster (1902) ** Suffolk (1903) \u2013 Sold 1920 * Devonshire class first class armoured cruiser, 10,850 tons, 4-7.5in, 6-6in ** Devonshire (1904) \u2013 Sold 1921 ** Hampshire (1903) \u2013 Mined 1916 ** Carnarvon (1903) ** Antrim (1903) \u2013 Sold 1922 ** Roxburgh (1904) \u2013 Sold 1921 ** Argyll (1904) \u2013 Wrecked 1915 * Duke of Edinburgh group first class armoured cruiser ** Duke of Edinburgh class 13,550 tons, 6-9.2in, 10-6in *** Duke of Edinburgh (1904) \u2013 Sold 1920 *** Black Prince (1904) \u2013 Sunk at the Battle of Jutland, 1916 ** Warrior class 13,550 tons, 6-9.2in, 4-7.5in *** Warrior (1905) \u2013 Sunk at the Battle of Jutland, 1916 *** Cochrane (1905) \u2013 Wrecked 1918 *** Achilles (1905) \u2013 Sold 1921 *** Natal (1905) \u2013 Explosion 1915 * Minotaur class first class armoured cruiser, 14,600 tons, 4-9.2in, 10-7.5in ** Minotaur (1906) \u2013 Sold 1920 ** Shannon (1906) \u2013 Sold 1922 ** Defence (1907) \u2013 Sunk at the Battle of Jutland, 1916 ==Protected cruisers== Protected cruisers were so-called because their vital machinery spaces were protected by an armoured deck and the arrangement of coal bunkers. The ships below are all protected cruisers, but were rated as second and third class cruisers by the Royal Navy. The third class cruiser was not expected to operate with the fleet, was substantially smaller than the second class and lacked the watertight double-bottom of the latter. With the advent of turbine machinery, oil firing and better armour plate the protected cruiser became obsolete and was succeeded by the light cruiser. * Iris class second class cruiser, 3,730 tons, 10-64pdr ** Iris (1877) ** Mercury (1878) * Comus class third class cruiser, 2,380 tons (Constance 2,590 tons), 2-7in + 12-64pdr (except Comus 4-6in + 8-64pdr;

Essentially there were two distinct groups \u2013 the eight vessels all ordered under the 1903 Programme, and the seven later vessels ordered under the 1907-1910 Programmes. The advent of better machinery and larger, faster destroyers and light cruisers effectively made them obsolete. * Sentinel class 2,880 tons, 10 x 12pdr ** Sentinel (1904) \u2013 Sold 1923 ** Skirmisher (1905) \u2013 Sold 1920 * Adventure class 2,640 tons, 10 x 12pdr ** Adventure (1904) \u2013 Sold 1920 ** Attentive (1904) \u2013 Sold 1920 * Forward class 2,860 tons, 10 x 12pdr ** Forward (1904) \u2013 Sold 1921 ** Foresight (1904) \u2013 Sold 1920 * Pathfinder class 2,900 tons, 10 x 12pdr ** Pathfinder (1904) \u2013 Torpedoed 1914 ** Patrol (1904) \u2013 Sold 1920 * Boadicea class 3,300 tons, 6 x 4in ** Boadicea (1908) ** Bellona (1909) * Blonde class 3,350 tons, 10 x 4in ** Blonde (1910) ** Blanche (1909) * Active class 3,440 tons, 10 x 4in ** Active (1911) ** Amphion (1911) ** Fearless (1912) ==Light cruisers== The light armoured cruiser \u2013 light cruiser \u2013 succeeded the protected cruiser; improvements in machinery and armour rendering the latter obsolete. The Town class of 1910 were rated as second- class protected cruisers, but were effectively light armoured cruisers with mixed coal and oil firing. The Arethusa class of 1913 were the first oil-only fired class. This meant that the arrangement of coal bunkers in the hull could no longer be relied upon as protection and the adoption of destroyer-type machinery resulted in a higher speed. This makes the Arethusas the first \"true example\" of the warship that came to be recognised as the light cruiser. In the London Naval Treaty of 1930, light cruisers were officially defined as cruisers having guns of 6.1 inches (155 mm) calibre or less, with a displacement not exceeding 10,000 tons. * Town class

(1961) ==Heavy cruisers== The heavy cruiser was defined in the London Naval Treaty of 1930 as a cruiser with a main gun calibre not exceeding 8 inches. The earlier Hawkins class were therefore retrospectively classified as such, although they had been initially built as \"improved light cruisers\". The County and York classes were also built as light cruisers with most of them in service at the time of the Treaty of London, after which they were also redesignated heavy cruisers. * Cavendish or Hawkins class 9,860 tons, 7-7.5in ** Cavendish (1918) \u2013 completed as carrier Vindictive, to cruiser 1925, to training ship 1937 ** Hawkins (1919) \u2013 scrapped 1947 ** Raleigh (1920) \u2013 wrecked 1922 ** Frobisher (1924) \u2013 scrapped 1949 ** Effingham (1925) \u2013 wrecked 1940 * County class, 8-8in ** Kent group 10,570 tons ***Cumberland (1928) \u2013 scrapped 1959 ***Berwick (1928) \u2013 scrapped 1948 ***Cornwall (1928) \u2013 bombed 1942 ***Suffolk (1928) \u2013 scrapped 1948 ***Kent (1928) \u2013 scrapped 1948 *** Australia (1928) \u2013 Royal Australian Navy, scrapped 1955 *** Canberra (1928) \u2013 Royal Australian Navy, torpedoed 1942 ** London group 9,830 tons *** London (1929) \u2013 scrapped 1950 *** Devonshire (1929) \u2013 scrapped 1954 *** Shropshire (1929) \u2013 to Royal Australian Navy 1943, scrapped 1955 *** Sussex (1929) \u2013 scrapped 1950 ** Norfolk group 10,300 tons *** Norfolk (1930) \u2013 scrapped 1950 *** Dorsetshire (1930) \u2013 sunk by dive bombers in Far East 1942 * York class modified County design 8,250 tons, 6-8in ** York (1930) \u2013 damaged by explosive motor boats, salvage abandoned and wrecked 1941, scrapped 1952 ** Exeter (1931) \u2013 sunk 1942, Far East ==Large light cruisers== The \"large light cruisers\" were a pet project of Admiral Fisher to operate in shallow Baltic Sea waters and they are often classed as a form of battlecruiser. * '''Courageous or Glorious class' ** Glorious group 19,320 tons, 4-15in, 18-4in *** Glorious (77) (1916) \u2013 converted to aircraft carrier 1924-1930 *** Courageous (50) (1916) \u2013 converted to aircraft carrier 1924-1928 ** Furious 19,513 tons, 2-18in, 11-5.5in *** Furious (47) (1917) \u2013 completed as aircraft carrier ==Minelaying cruisers== These \"minelaying cruisers\" were the only purpose-built oceangoing minelayers of the Royal Navy. * Adventure 6,740 tons, 4-4.7in ** Adventure (M23) (1926) \u2013 converted to repair ship 1944, scrapped 1947 * Abdiel class ** 1938 group 2,650 tons, 6-4in ***Abdiel (M39) (1941) \u2013 sunk in Taranto Bay 1943 ***Latona (M76) (1941) \u2013 sunk off Libya 1941 ***Manxman (M70) (1941) \u2013 scrapped 1972 ***Welshman (M84) (1941) \u2013 sunk off Crete 1943 ** WEP group 2,650 tons, 4-4in ***Ariadne (M65) (1944) \u2013 scrapped 1965 ***Apollo (M01) (1944) \u2013 scrapped 1962 ==Through deck cruisers== Although at times called \"through deck cruisers\", the Invincible class of the 1980s were small aircraft carriers. ==See also== * List of cruisers Cruisers Royal Navy Royal Navy ",
