The name of the town is derived from an Aboriginal word meaning 'mountain with a rugged top'. At the , the Burrinjuck area had a population of 19. The village is situated on the western side of Burrinjuck Dam which holds water from the Murrumbidgee River and which was constructed between 1907 and 1928 (with World War I interfering with the timing of the construction). Barren Jack Post Office opened on 23 May 1907, was renamed Burrinjuck in 1911, and closed in 1979. Visit of State Governors to Burrinjuck Dam in 1915 == Heritage listings == Burrinjuck has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Barren Jack Creek Water Supply Dam * Burrinjuck Dam * Greater Burrinjuck Dam Site ==Climate== Owing to the windward position of Burrinjuck astride the western slopes of the Brindabella Range, maximum temperatures are significantly cooler relative to altitude than regions on the eastern side of the range\u2014i.e. the Australian Capital Territory; this difference in maxima is most pronounced in winter, jointly with much higher winter precipitation. Snow falls occasionally at the bottom of the valley, but it regularly occurs on the surrounding ranges and farmland above (such as at Wee Jasper); nearby Black Andrew Mountain (935 metres) and Mount Barren Jack (972 metres) overlooking the lake, are periodically snow- capped from June to August. ==References== Category:Yass Valley Council Category:Towns in New South Wales Category:Southern Tablelands ",
