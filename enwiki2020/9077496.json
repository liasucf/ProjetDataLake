    "text": "Luce Bay is a large bay in Wigtownshire in southern Scotland. The bay is 20 miles wide at its mouth and is bounded by the Rhins of Galloway to the west and the Machars to the east. ==Bombing range== From the 1930s to the 1990s it was a bombing range used for training purposes by RAF aircraft (and later allied aircraft on a leasing basis) based at West Freugh. Discharged bombs were retrieved by a retired minesweeper based at Drummore. It is still a licensed MOD Range with Byelawshttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/39441/luce_bay_gunnery_bombing_ranges.pdf restricting access during Test and Evaluation activities conducted by QinetiQhttps://www.qinetiq.com/contact/pages/officedetails.aspx?siteid=46 on behalf of the MOD. Once an important commercial fishery, Luce Bay is now seldom used for this purpose. It contains important marine and littoral life, however, and has been declared a Special Area of Conservation by Scottish Natural Heritage ==Places on Luce Bay coastline== *Ardwell, Auchenmalg *Chappel Rossan *Drummore *Glenluce *River Luce *Maryport, Mull of Galloway *Monreith *Port William *Sandhead *Terrally Bay, Torrs Warren ==See also== * Deep Sea Range on the Outer Hebrides * RAF Tain on the Moray Firth ==References== ==External links== * Qinetiq Category:Bays of Scotland Category:Bombing ranges Category:History of Dumfries and Galloway Category:Landforms of Dumfries and Galloway Category:Military installations in Scotland Category:Solway Firth ",
