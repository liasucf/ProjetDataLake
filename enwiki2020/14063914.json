    "text": "The striped crayfish snake (Liodytes alleni) is a species of semiaquatic North American snake that derives its common name from its principal prey, crayfish. This snake is also called Allen's snake, the striped swamp snake, the striped swampsnake, or simply the swamp snake. It is endemic to peninsular Florida.Smith HM, Brodie ED Jr (1982). Reptiles of North America: A Guide to Field Identification. New York: Golden Press. . 240 pp. (STRIPED SWAMP SNAKE, pp. 158-159). Although rarely seen due to its secretive behavior, it can be found in large numbers in wet areas, with densities approaching 1,300 snakes per hectare (525 snakes per acre).Godley JS (1980). \"Foraging ecology of the striped swamp snake, Regina alleni, in Southern Florida\". Ecological Monographs 50: 411-436. ==Etymology== The specific name, alleni, is in honor of zoologist Joel Asaph Allen,Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Regina alleni, p. 5). who collected the type specimen. ==Description== The striped crayfish snake is of \"small medium\" size, in total length (including tail), with a heavy body.Conant, Roger (1975). A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Second Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. xviii + 429 pp. + Plates 1-48. (hardcover), (paperback). (STRIPED SWAMP SNAKE Liodytes alleni, p. 152 + Plate 22 + Map 111). The stripes which contribute to its common name are indistinct and located on the dark dorsal side. The ventral side is yellow with some dark spots. The dorsal scales, which are arranged in 19 rows at midbody, are smooth on the body, with some keeled scales in the anal region. There is a clear sexual dimorphism with the females being the larger sex.Wright AH, Wright AA (1957). Handbook of Snakes of the United States and Canada. Two Volumes. Ithaca and London: Comstock Publishing Associates, a division of Cornell University Press. 1,105 pp. (Size of adults, p. 7; Liodytes alleni, pp. 419-423, Figure 128, Map 35).Behler, John L.; King, F. Wayne (1979). The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Reptiles and Amphibians. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. 743 pp. . (Striped Crayfish Snake, Regina alleni, p. 646 + Plate 510). The striped crayfish snake is very similar to the glossy crayfish snake (Liodytes rigida rigida), but has one row of spots on the underside, whereas the glossy crayfish snake has two spots. ==Natural habitat== The striped crayfish snake is a semiaquatic snake and is regularly found in swamps and open wetlands with heavy plant growth, cypress swamps, saw grass prairies, swamps, and roadside ditches. The snake has adapted well to the beds of water hyacinth that has taken over many waterways. Although the species is aquatic, they are rarely seen in moving water. The snake is primarily found in Florida, they are commonly found east of the central panhandle and in southeastern Georgia. The northern range limit is near the Florida-Georgia border. ==Behavior and diet== Striped crayfish snakes are active throughout the year except for the coldest months of winter. When they are active, they typically can be found among the roots of aquatic vegetation, and on land beneath logs or organic litter. They are active in still water during the day and probably at night. On cool days, they find sunny areas on land to bask in. The striped crayfish snake feeds primarily on crayfish. They use their coils to hold their prey while they consume them alive. Their teeth are small and very sharp, allowing them to grab and hold the hard outer covering of the crayfish. They typically swallow the crustacean tail first. Juveniles feed on insect larvae, most commonly the larvae of dragonflies and shrimp. ==Reproduction== There is very little known about the reproduction of the striped crayfish snake. They probably mate during the spring season and the eggs hatch during the late summer or autumn. Clutches range in size from four to twelve eggs. Larger snakes usually produce more eggs than smaller snakes. ==Predators and defense== Natural predators include great egrets, great blue herons, sandhill cranes, kingsnakes, cottonmouth snakes, large salamanders and river otters. When attacked or disturbed, the striped crayfish snake escapes into the water. The snake releases a strong odor from its scent glands when captured. They do not bite, but may thrash around vigorously when captured. ==Conservation== Because the striped crayfish snake is dependent on a continuous and abundant supply of crayfish, any major changes to the crayfish supply, including destruction of the crayfish habitat, pollution and destruction of wetlands will be a threat to the survival of the striped crayfish snake. The species is not legally protected in Florida or George, but is considered a conservation concern. ==References== ==External links== * ==Further reading== *Boulenger GA (1893).
