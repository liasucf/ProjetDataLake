    "text": "The 2020 Major League Baseball season has been shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic. The full 162-game regular season was originally scheduled to begin on March 26. However, the pandemic caused Major League Baseball (MLB) to announce on March 12 that the remainder of spring training was canceled and that the start of the regular season would be delayed by at least two weeks. On March 16, MLB announced that the season would be postponed indefinitely, following recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to restrict events of more than 50 people. This was the first time MLB games have been put on hold since the 2001 season, when the season was paused for over a week after the September 11 attacks. Spring training resumed on July 1 and was rebranded as \"Summer Camp\". Each team was scheduled to play 60 regular season games, which began on July 23 and ended on September 27. On July 3, the All-Star Game was canceled because of the delay to the regular season. Dodger Stadium, which was set to host the game, will now host the 2022 All-Star Game. On July 18, the Canadian federal government denied permission for the Toronto Blue Jays to play their home games at Rogers Centre this season on grounds that repeated cross-border trips by both the Blue Jays and their opponents would be a major risk due to the higher spikes in COVID-19 cases in the U.S. compared to those in Canada. The Blue Jays then chose to play their home games at Sahlen Field in Buffalo, home of their Triple-A affiliate Buffalo Bisons. An expanded 16-team postseason tournament began on September 29, with games of all but the first round being played at neutral sites. The World Series is set to begin on October 20 at Globe Life Field in Arlington, and Game 7 will be played on October 28 if needed. ==Schedule== The 2020 schedule greatly differed from the normal 162-game schedule. In an effort to reduce travel, each team played only nine opponents during the regular season instead of the usual 19 or 20. Teams were scheduled to play 10 games against each of their four division opponents. The remaining 20 games of the 60-game schedule were interleague contests. To reduce travel, the interleague division match-ups were AL East vs NL East, AL Central vs NL Central, and AL West vs NL West. At 60 games, this was the shortest regular season since 1878. Several international and neutral-site games originally scheduled for the season were canceled due to COVID-19: *On March 19, the Mexico Series and Puerto Rico Series games were canceled; the former would have featured the San Diego Padres and the Arizona Diamondbacks at Mexico City's Estadio Alfredo Harp Hel\u00fa, and the latter featuring the New York Mets and the Miami Marlins at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan. *On April 1, MLB canceled the London Series, which would have featured the Chicago Cubs and the St. Louis Cardinals at London Stadium. *On April 30, MLB canceled the MLB Little League Classic at BB&T; Ballpark in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, coinciding with the Little League World Series, which was scheduled to be played on August 23 between the Boston Red Sox and Baltimore Orioles. This cancellation coincided with the cancellation of the 2020 Little League World Series. *On August 3, MLB canceled MLB at Field of Dreams \u2014 a game that was scheduled to be played on August 13 between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago White Sox at a temporary 8,000-seat ballpark on the Dyersville, Iowa farm site of the 1989 sports film Field of Dreams. The game has been postponed to 2021. ===March agreement between MLB and MLBPA=== On March 26, MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) reached an agreement on multiple considerations related to the start of the season being delayed, including: * The 2020 MLB draft was to be held by July 20 and reduced from 40 rounds to five rounds. * Player salaries were pro-rated, based on the length of the regular season. * Players will receive full service time for the season, regardless of the length of the season * Roster moves were frozen as of March 27, until the season began. ===Possible schedules=== The indefinite delay of the season caused MLB to internally consider a number of scenarios for playing the season, as well as analysts suggesting ways it could be done. A shortened regular season, a season with many doubleheaders, and a postseason extending into late November with a World Series at an indoor or warm-weather neutral site were suggested. In early April, Jeff Passan of ESPN reported that MLB was \"increasingly focused on a plan that could allow them to start the season as early as May and has the support of high-ranking federal public health officials\". The plan would have involved all 30 teams playing games with no fans in stadiums around the Phoenix metropolitan area, including Chase Field and spring training complexes. Players would have lived in isolation at local hotels. Another report from USA Today baseball writer Bob Nightengale detailed another MLB proposal utilizing the Phoenix metro sites, but with the additional use of spring training sites in Florida, Marlins Park in Miami, and St. Petersburg's Tropicana Field. In addition, the 30 teams would be re- aligned for the season depending on their spring training sites into six divisions based upon their locations in Arizona and Florida and agnostic to the usual AL/NL demarcations and traditional geographic rivalries, effectively making the spring training Cactus League and Grapefruit League regular-season leagues.MLB considering radical realignment for 2020 season: Grapefruit and Cactus leagues, USA Today, Bob Nightengale, April 10, 2020. No interleague play would take place and the designated hitter rule would be utilized for all 30 teams, with the World Series occurring in November utilizing the larger MLB sites. ===Disagreement over plans for a shortened season=== During May and June, MLB and Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) were unable to agree on a specific plan for a shortened season. In mid-May the MLB owners proposed a schedule of 82 games, to begin in July, with games to be played without fans in attendance. To minimize travel, teams would play only against other teams in their geographical division, plus interleague games against teams in the corresponding division of the other league. A team would play 13 games against each division rival and six games against each team in the other league's division. Postseason play would be expanded from 10 teams to 14, with each league fielding three division winners and four wild card teams. A designated hitter would be allowed in all games. Teams would have 30-man rosters available for each game. The proposal also outlined safety measures for health of players and staff and a modified compensation plan for players. On June 1, the MLBPA countered with an 114-game proposal, with a regular season running from June 30 to October 31, a November postseason, giving players the right to opt-out of participating, a salary deferral plan in the event the postseason has to be canceled due to a second wave of the virus, and a $100 million advance during the second spring training, among others. Owners then submitted a 76-game proposal to the players on June 8, with the regular season ending on September 27, the postseason ending in October, 75 percent prorated player salaries, and playoff pool money, among others. The MLBPA responded one day later with an 89-game plan with full prorated player salaries. The owners then sent a 72-game plan with 70 percent prorated player salaries, to which the MLBPA replied in a statement on June 13, \"Further dialogue with the league would be futile. It's time to get back to work. Tell us when and where.\" However, the week of June 15 saw the owners propose a 60-game season while MLBPA counter with a 70-game season, which on June 19 was rejected by the owners. Amid an increase in cases in Arizona and Florida, including positive cases among staff of the Phillies, and a Blue Jays player showing signs of symptoms, it was reported on June 19 that all spring training sites would be temporarily closed for deep cleaning, and all players would be required to test negative for COVID-19 before entering. It was then reported on June 20 that almost all MLB teams had elected to re-locate their training camps back to their home cities. On June 22, hours after the MLBPA rejected the MLB's offer to play a 60-game season, MLB owners voted unanimously to impose the 60-game plan. By allowing the owners to unilaterally implement such a plan without the MLBPA, both sides retained the right to file a grievance against the other for not negotiating in good faith. On June 23, both sides agreed to health and safety protocols. Players reported to training camp July 1. Due to concerns related to the pandemic, several players chose not to play the season. ===Revised 60-game schedule=== On July 6, MLB released the revised schedule for the shortened 60-game season. In the new schedule, teams play 10 games against each of their four divisional opponents in three series, with an unequal number of home games against each opponent. Each team will have 20 home games for division opponents. Interleague play will comprise the other 20 games of the schedule, all against the division of the opposite league, temporarily suspending the yearly rotation of which divisions play each other. Like normal seasons in which corresponding interleague divisions play each other (e.g. 2018), teams play six games against their \"natural rival\" and three or four games against each of the other four teams in the division. However, for this year only, the Cleveland Indians were paired with the Pittsburgh Pirates instead of their normal rivals, the Cincinnati Reds, and the Detroit Tigers were paired with the Reds instead of the Pirates. This was done to reduce travel for all four teams. The season started on July 23, with two games: New York Yankees at Washington Nationals and San Francisco Giants at Los Angeles Dodgers. The remaining 26 teams opened the season on July 24. On July 23, MLB and MLBPA announced that the postseason will be an expanded 16-team playoff tournament for 2020 only, instead of the normal 10-team tournament. All first and second place teams in the six divisions will qualify for the playoffs. The final two spots in each league will go to the remaining teams with the best win-loss records. The teams in each league will be seeded by division winners (1\u20133), division runners-up (4\u20136), and best teams remaining (7\u20138). Seeding ties will be resolved by head-to-head record, intra-league record, and record in final 20 intra-league games, to remove the necessity for additional games. The first round of the playoffs will be a best-of-three series called the Wild Card Series, with all games to be played at the home of the higher seeded team. After that, the postseason will follow the usual pattern of five-game Division series, seven-game League Championship Series, and a seven-game World Series. ===Postponed games=== ====COVID-19==== COVID-19 outbreaks among the Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals, as well as positive tests on the Cincinnati Reds, New York Mets, Oakland Athletics, and San Francisco Giants, resulted in the postponement of a total of 40 games. Miami received confirmation that starting pitcher Jos\u00e9 Ure\u00f1a had tested positive and would not be available on July 26, but the team decided to play the third and final game of their scheduled series against the Philadelphia Phillies at the direction of Major League Baseball. After additional Miami players and coaches tested positive, MLB postponed Miami's four-game home-and-home series with the Baltimore Orioles, and Philadelphia's four-game home-and-home series with the New York Yankees, both originally scheduled from July 27 to 30. In order to allow for some flexibility in making games up, the Yankees and Orioles played two games against each other in Baltimore July 29 and 30, moving them up one week from their originally scheduled dates of August 3 and 4. The Marlins later confirmed that 21 players and coaches tested positive. The next series for both teams, Miami's home series against the Washington Nationals and Philadelphia's series at the Toronto Blue Jays, were postponed. Both series would have taken place from July 31 to August 2. St. Louis had six positive tests resulting in the postponement of three games at the Milwaukee Brewers from July 31 to August 2. Four additional games, a home-and-home series against the Detroit Tigers originally scheduled for August 3 to 6, were also postponed after an additional seven positive tests were reported. After continued positive tests throughout the next week, St. Louis's three-game series against the Chicago Cubs, originally August 7 to 9, and their three- game series against the Pittsburgh Pirates, originally August 10 to 12, were postponed. A doubleheader against Detroit on August 13 which would have been made up games from August 3 and 4 was also postponed and later cancelled. Cincinnati had a player test positive resulting in the postponement of two games against Pittsburgh on August 15 and 16. Cincinnati's game against the Kansas City Royals on August 18 was postponed as well. The New York Mets had a player and staff member test positive resulting in the postponement of their August 20 game against Miami and their three-game series against the New York Yankees on August 21 to 23. Oakland had a positive test resulting in the postponement of their August 30 game against the Houston Astros. As a precaution, Oakland's three-game series against the Seattle Mariners on September 1 to 3 was postponed. San Francisco had a positive test resulting in the postponement of two games against the San Diego Padres originally scheduled for September 11 and 12. ====Shooting of Jacob Blake==== Player protests in response to the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin resulted in the postponement of 11 games. The Milwaukee Brewers announced that they would not play their August 26 game against the Cincinnati Reds in the wake of the shooting, following three NBA playoff games that were postponed the same day. Two additional games were postponed that day. Seven games on August 27 and one game on August 28 were also postponed. ==Standings== ===American League=== ===National League=== == Postseason == MLB announced the playoff bracket on September 15, consisting of eight teams from each league: the top two teams from each division, plus the teams from each league with the next two best records. The Wild Card Series would be a best-of-three series, while the Division Series, League Championship Series, and World Series would be their normal lengths. The Wild Card Series games would be played at the home field of the higher seeded team. The division and league championship series would be played at neutral sites, similar to those used for both the National Basketball Association and National Hockey League playoffs, to limit the possibility of another COVID-19 outbreak that could both disrupt the schedule and affect competitive integrity. The American League would play at the San Diego Padres' Petco Park and the Los Angeles Dodgers' Dodger Stadium, while the National League would play at the Texas Rangers' Globe Life Field and the Houston Astros' Minute Maid Park. The World Series would then take place at Globe Life Field. With all division matchups, this is the first time all four league division series are intradivision since 1981. The Milwaukee Brewers and Houston Astros became the first teams to make the postseason with a record below .500. Both clubs went in the regular season. The Astros became the first team with a record below .500 to win a playoff series, as they defeated the Minnesota Twins in the Wild Card Series and the Oakland Athletics in the Division Series. ===Bracket=== ==Rule changes== === Permanent changes announced prior to season === The following changes, effective for the 2020 season, were officially announced by MLB on February 12: * The size of the active roster expands from 25 players to 26 players, through August 31. ** During this time, and during the postseason, clubs can carry a maximum of 13 pitchers. ** Any team that is playing the second game of a doubleheader or a scheduled neutral-site game (such as the MLB Little League Classic), may carry a 27th player for that game only. This player can either be a position player or pitcher. * The size of the expanded roster in September is reduced from 40 players to 28 players. ** During this time, clubs can carry a maximum of 14 pitchers. * Teams must designate players as either \"position players\" or \"pitchers\" before the start of the season. ** Only players designated as pitchers will be allowed to pitch in any regular-season or postseason game, with limited exceptions (such as one team leading by at least seven runs, or the game going into extra innings). ** Once a position player has pitched at least 20 innings and made at least three plate appearances as a position player or designated hitter in each of 20 games, he earns the status of \"two- way player\" for the remainder of the season plus all of the next season. Players with this status may pitch at any time during a game. For this season only, any player who met the above requirements in either the 2018 or 2019 season qualifies for two-way status. ** Players designated as pitchers, if placed on the injured list, must spend a minimum of 15 days on the IL prior to being eligible for activation. Position players may be activated after a minimum of 10 days on the IL. Two-way players are subject to the rules for pitchers. The seven-day minimum on the IL for concussions remains unchanged. * Pitchers and two-way players optioned to the minor leagues must remain there for at least 15 days before being eligible for recall to the major league club, rather than the previous 10-day minimum. The minimum option period for position players remains 10 days. * A pitcher must face at least three batters unless the inning ends or the pitcher is injured. * Managers now have up to 20 seconds to challenge a play (reduced from 30 seconds). ===Temporary rules for shortened 2020 season=== The following temporary rules for the shortened 2020 season were announced on June 24. Note that some of these additional changes supersede the rule changes which were announced in February. * Each club could invite up to 60 players to its July training camp. The 60-man pool is comprised of players on the 40-man roster and players currently signed to minor league contracts. Clubs were not required to include all members of their 40-man roster in the 60-man pool. The transaction freeze in place since March 27 was lifted on June 26. Only players eligible to play in the 2020 season could be invited to July camp, and only the 60 players included on the list submitted to the league office may be used by the team in regular season and postseason games for the 2020 season. If a player is added to the 60-man pool via trade, free agent signing, or other transaction, a corresponding transaction must be made to keep the total number of eligible players at 60. Players in the 60-man pool who were not on a club's 40-man roster at the start of July camp must be added to the 40-man and active rosters in the usual fashion before they may play in regular season or postseason games. Those not on the active roster train at an alternate training site. * The designated hitter would be used in both the American and National Leagues. * Teams could have up to 30 active players on their opening day rosters. The active roster was reduced to 28 after the first two weeks of the season. Originally, the roster was set to reduce to reduce to 26 players after four weeks, but this reduction was eliminated on August 4. * The minimum option period for players optioned to their club's training site is 10 days for both pitchers and position players. The provision requiring pitchers to remain in the minor leagues for 15 days is not in effect this season. * The trade deadline was August 31 (moved from July 31). * To be eligible for the postseason, a player must have been added to a club's 40-man roster by September 15. * Clubs were permitted to carry a taxi-squad of players for away games. Originally, the squad was limited to three players. On August 4, the squad was expanded to five players. The original rule stipulated that if three players were carried, at least one had to be a catcher. It is unclear if that restriction remains under the new rule. * In regular-season games, each half-inning of an extra inning automatically started with a runner on second base. The runner was the player in the batting order position immediately before the lead-off batter for the inning (or a pinch-runner, subject to the usual substitution rules). Should this runner score, it was considered an unearned run. This rule does not apply to postseason games. * There was a 10-day injured list for both pitchers and position players. The 60-day IL was reduced to 45 days. * A separate IL exists for players who test positive for, have symptoms of, or have confirmed exposure to COVID-19. There is no maximum or minimum number of days for this IL. * There are no limitations on eligible pitchers. The \"two- way player\" provisions announced in February do not apply for this season. * If a game cannot continue because of inclement weather and it is not an official game (trailing team has played less than five innings), the game will be declared a suspended game, continuing from the point of interruption instead of completely restarting. * The postseason was expanded to include eight teams from each league. The first round is a best-of-three series with the better seed hosting all three games. * The final three rounds of postseason will be played at neutral sites. ** Globe Life Field and Minute Maid Park were chosen to host the National League playoffs; each stadium would host one Division Series and Globe Life Field would host the National League Championship Series. ** Petco Park and Dodger Stadium were chosen to host the American League playoffs; each stadium would host one Division Series and Petco Park would host the American League Championship Series. ** The World Series will be held at Globe Life Field. * Clubs were required to have an expanded dugout in order to practice social distancing. * Celebrations (such as those after a walk-off hit) must be socially distanced. * Pitchers were allowed to use wet rags. * In the postseason, alcohol is banned from playoff celebrations. Celebrations must be done on the field, at least six feet apart, and not in the clubhouse. Champagne is also prohibited. * No physical lineup cards were exchanged. Instead, lineups were exchanged through the MLB app. The following temporary rule was announced on July 30, to be effective on August 1. * Doubleheaders consisted of two seven-inning games. One doubleheader, which was played on July 28 before the rule change, featured two nine-inning games. ==Players opting out== {| class=wikitable |+Key |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#ffb;\"|* |Opted out after playing during the 2020 season |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#bfb;\"|** |Player subsequently opted back in |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+Players who opted out of the 2020 season !scope=\"col\"|Player !scope=\"col\"|Position !scope=\"col\"|Team |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffb;\"|* |Outfielder||Milwaukee |- !scope=\"row\"| |Catcher||Washington |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffb;\"|* |Outfielder||New York Mets |- !scope=\"row\"| |Relief pitcher||Colorado |- !scope=\"row\"| |Outfielder||Colorado |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#bfb;\"|** |Second baseman||Miami |- !scope=\"row\"| |Starting pitcher||Atlanta |- !scope=\"row\"| |Relief pitcher||St. Louis |- !scope=\"row\"| |Starting pitcher||Chicago White Sox |- !scope=\"row\"| |Starting pitcher||Arizona |- !scope=\"row\"| |Relief pitcher||Free agent |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#bfb;\"|** |Outfielder||Atlanta |- !scope=\"row\"| |Starting pitcher||Milwaukee |- !scope=\"row\"| |Starting pitcher||Boston |- !scope=\"row\"| |Relief pitcher||Pittsburgh |- !scope=\"row\"| |Catcher||San Francisco |- !scope=\"row\"| |Starting pitcher||Los Angeles Dodgers |- !scope=\"row\"| |Starting pitcher||Washington |- !scope=\"row\"| |Starting pitcher||Free agent |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffb;\"|* |Shortstop||Los Angeles Angels |- !scope=\"row\"| |Starting pitcher||Baltimore |- !scope=\"row\"| |Starting pitcher||New York Mets |- !scope=\"row\"| |Outfielder||Chicago Cubs |- !scope=\"row\"| |First baseman||Washington |} ==Managerial changes== ===General managers=== ====Offseason==== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Team !scope=\"col\"|Former GM !scope=\"col\"|Reason For Leaving !scope=\"col\"|New GM !scope=\"col\"|Notes |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Boston Red Sox |Dave Dombrowski | rowspan=\"3\" | Fired |Brian O'Halloran | style=\"text-align:left;\" | Dombrowski, whose title was President of Baseball Operations, was unexpectedly fired on September 9, 2019, less than one year after the Red Sox won the World Series.

Cincinnati added a new alternate jersey and a new spring training jersey. Milwaukee introduced new uniforms, including a return to the ball-in-glove logo used as their primary logo from 1978\u201393. They also switched out their gold color to yellow. Minnesota added a new alternate uniform, utilizing its powder blue 1973\u20131986 road uniform design. Pittsburgh brought back the script \"Pittsburgh\" from the 1990s on new alternate and road uniforms, along with a gold outlined \"P\" on their caps. Texas introduced a new powder blue jersey along with a powder blue hat. It also changed the \"Texas\" wordmark to \"Rangers\" wordmark on the white jersey and revealed a new red hat with the state of Texas on it with \"TX.\" Toronto added a new alternate based on its 1979\u20131988 powder blue road jerseys. Washington added two new alternate hats and one alternate white jersey. San Diego changed its primary colors from navy blue to brown and gold, the team's primary colors from 1969\u201384. St. Louis made changes to its logo as it appears on the caps. Throwbacks The Cardinals and Royals wore Negro Leagues throwbacks September 22. The Cardinals wore 1930 St. Louis Stars uniforms, and the Royals wore 1945 Kansas City Monarchs uniforms. ==Venues== This is the Texas Rangers' first season at Globe Life Field, replacing Globe Life Park in Arlington where they played from 1994 to 2019. Their first game was July 24 against the Colorado Rockies. The Miami Marlins converted Marlins Park from a natural grass surface to Shaw Sports B1K artificial turf and the field's fences will be moved in closer. The Atlanta Braves' SunTrust Park was renamed Truist Park after SunTrust Banks's merger with BB&T; Bank into Truist Financial. === Temporary relocation of the Toronto Blue Jays === On July 18, the Canadian federal government denied the Toronto Blue Jays exceptions to the Quarantine Act to play regular season home games at Rogers Centre this season. Although they were allowed to conduct training camp with stricter protocols than those mandated by MLB, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Marco Mendicino cited that repeated cross-border travel by players would carry a major risk due to the higher number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. Mendicino did not rule out the permission being granted for postseason games, depending on the status of the pandemic in the U.S. by then, however the Blue Jays would not have any home postseason games. On July 20, the Pittsburgh Pirates offered the use of PNC Park as a site for Blue Jays home games. However, health officials in Pennsylvania denied permission for this arrangement, citing concerns over additional travel to and from Pittsburgh amid an increase in local cases. On July 24, the Blue Jays announced that they would play the majority of their home games at Sahlen Field in Buffalo, New York, home of the Jays' AAA affiliate, the Buffalo Bisons. The Jays' first game in Buffalo was August 11 against the Miami Marlins. The Jays' first two home series against the Washington Nationals and Philadelphia Phillies were relocated to the visiting teams' venues, Nationals Park and Citizens Bank Park, respectively, with the Jays as designated home team. However, the Phillies series was postponed and made up in Buffalo. ==Broadcast rights== ===Television=== ====National==== This is the seventh year of the current eight-year deals with Fox, ESPN, and TBS. Fox was to televise the MLB at Field of Dreams game on August 13. FS1 will televise games on Tuesday nights and on Saturdays both during the afternoon and night. ESPN will televise games on its flagship telecast Sunday Night Baseball as well as Monday and Wednesday nights. Fox and ESPN Sunday Night Baseball telecasts will be exclusive; all other national telecasts will be subject to local blackout. TBS televised one AL Wild Card Series, and is airing both American League Division Series matchups, and the American League Championship Series. ESPN televised seven of the eight Wild Card Series, with live look-ins and alternate broadcasts on ESPN+. On September 28, it was announced that ABC will broadcast at least four of ESPN's Wild Card Series games, marking the first time a national MLB game has aired on the network since 1995 (via the ill-fated The Baseball Network arrangement). FS1 and MLB Network will televise both National League Division Series matchups. Fox and FS1 will televise the National League Championship Series, and the World Series will be on Fox for the 21st straight year. ====Local==== * In Chicago, new television deals resulted in the end of free- to-air regional telecasts for the city's two franchises. In February, the Cubs launched the team-owned Marquee Sports Network, a joint venture with Sinclair Broadcast Group. The White Sox signed exclusively with NBC Sports Chicago under a multi-year deal. * In November 2019, MLB owners voted unanimously to revert \"certain in-market digital [streaming] rights\" to the teams themselves. * On April 1, the Los Angeles Dodgers' Spectrum SportsNet LA reached a carriage deal with AT&T; (covering AT&T; TV, U-verse, and DirecTV), concluding a seven-year impasse that had hindered the network's local availability. ===Radio=== ====National==== *ESPN Radio will air its 23rd season of national coverage, including Sunday Night Baseball, Saturday Games, Opening Day, Labor Day games, and the entire Major League Baseball postseason. ====Local==== *The Oakland Athletics were briefly the first MLB team to abandon terrestrial radio in their primary market in favor of internet radio; the team initially carried games on TuneIn via the \"A's Cast\" channel, with plans for some games to be aired without commercial interruptions. The decision was prompted by competition with other local sports teams for time on stations, resulting in frequent pre-emptions and lowered priorities, and conflicts with regular station programming. The broadcasts were still carried on some terrestrial radio stations outside the Bay Area (with the closest being Sacramento's KHTK). However, on July 30, 2020, it was reported that the team had backed out of the arrangement and signed with iHeartMedia to make 960 KNEW the team's flagship station (with its streaming platform shifting to iHeartRadio), beginning July 31. Team owner Dave Kaval cited people having become \"budget- conscious\" due to the pandemic as having influenced the decision. *Entercom's KMNB/Minneapolis will join WCCO as the FM flagship for the Minnesota Twins in an extension of rights until the 2023 season. *Chicago White Sox radio play- by-play announcer Ed Farmer, a former pitcher for the team who had been part of the team's radio broadcast staff since 1991, died on April 1 after a long- term battle with polycystic kidney disease. On June 30, the team and its radio network named Andy Masur (the former pre-game host) as Farmer's successor. === Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on production === In order to reduce avoidable travel and the amount of personnel on-site for each game, most MLB broadcasters will commentate away games remotely from either their broadcaster's studio, or their home stadium's broadcast booths. MLB safety protocols mandate remote broadcasts for away games on television, but radio broadcasters may be present on-site for away games if they so choose. Some teams will have their commentators on-site for home games only, and call away games from their studio. Furthermore, the home team's local television rightsholder will serve as the host broadcaster for each game, providing a neutral video feed to media partners (including the away team's local rightsholder, and in some cases, a national broadcaster), which will add commentary, graphics, and other surrounding coverage for their audience. MLB Network assisted with providing and using existing infrastructure for this arrangement. Audio from Sony Interactive Entertainment's MLB: The Show video game franchise will be used as artificial crowd noise for all games, and is being played over the stadiums' audio systems on-site. Fox announced plans to use augmented reality \"virtual fans\" in its games, while ESPN is leveraging experience from its remote broadcasts of KBO League games over the suspended pre-season. The pandemic has also led to changes in broadcast arrangements for several teams: * Due to health risks, the Baltimore Orioles announced that Gary Thorne and Jim Palmer will not call its games for MASN this season. * Sportsnet's Toronto Blue Jays color commentator Pat Tabler (who is a U.S. citizen) has taken on a reduced analyst role this season, leaving the team's alternate commentary team of Dan Shulman (play-by-play) and Buck Martinez (color; he normally performs play-by-play on games where Shulman is not present) for all regular-season games. Due to his commitments to ESPN Radio, Shulman was replaced by Joe Siddall for Toronto's Wild Card Series games. * Prior to the pandemic, the San Francisco Giants and NBC Sports Bay Area had already planned to have color commentator Mike Krukow broadcast 22 NL West road games remotely from the network's studios (with his play-by-play partner Duane Kuiper commentating on-site as normal), since his inclusion body myositis had made him unfit to travel. The need for this arrangement was ultimately rendered moot, with Krukow and Kuiper calling all Giants' games together from booths at Oracle Park. * On July 31, Texas Rangers radio voice Matt Hicks tested positive for COVID-19. His partner Eric Nadel subsequently opted out from broadcasting that weekend's games. After television voice C. J. Nitkowski tested positive in mid-September, Fox Sports Southwest switched to using a simulcast of the radio broadcast. ==Retirements== The following players retired during the 2020 season: *Alex Wilson - July 28 *Jos\u00e9 Reyes - July 29 *Chris Iannetta - August 8 *Ubaldo Jimenez - September 17 *Alex Gordon - September 24 that he will retire at the end of the season *Hunter Pence - September 26 *Francisco Cervelli - October 3https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2020/10/francisco-cervelli-announces- retirement.html ==Retired numbers== *Dick Allen had his #15 retired on September 3 by the Philadelphia Phillies. He is the seventh player to have his number retired by the franchise. Due to the delayed start of the season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the following retirement ceremonies have been postponed. They will be rescheduled. {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Player !scope=\"col\"|No. !scope=\"col\"|Team !scope=\"col\"|Original Date !scope=\"col\"|Ref |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| Larry Walker | 33 | Colorado Rockies | April 19 | |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| Dave Stewart | 34 | Oakland Athletics | May 23 | |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| Roy Halladay | 34 | Philadelphia Phillies | May 29 | |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text- align:left;\"| Jerry Koosman | 36 | New York Mets | June 13 | |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| Will Clark | 22 | San Francisco Giants | July 11 | |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| Lou Whitaker | 1 | Detroit Tigers | August 29 | |} ==Major League Baseball teams revenue losses for 2020== For 2020 Team Marketing Report has calculated five billion dollars in game day losses for Major League Baseball as a result of not having fans. ==See also== *2020 in baseball *2020 KBO League season *2020 Nippon Professional Baseball season *2020 Chinese Professional Baseball League season ==References== MLB Category:Major League Baseball seasons Major League Baseball season ",
