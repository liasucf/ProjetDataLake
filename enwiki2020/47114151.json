    "text": "Collinsium was a genus of lobopodian from the Early Cambrian. It is represented by a single fossil species, Collinsium ciliosum, found in the Xiaoshiba Lagerst\u00e4tte (Hongjingshao Formation) of China. Similar to the later Hallucigenia it was a small worm-like creature with spikes along its back and feeding tentacles near its head. Unlike Hallucigenia, Collinsium had 9 walking appendages and 4 fine anterior appendages. Its body was covered in hair-like Papillae, and its fine anterior appendages were lined with Setae likely used for filter feeding. The generic name honors paleontologist Desmond Collins. == References == Category:Prehistoric protostome genera Category:Cambrian China Category:Fossils of China Category:Fossil taxa described in 2015 ",
