The firm focused primarily on leather gloves, but in 1993 it expanded with its first collection of swimming trunks. Then, in 1995, the collection grew with the addition of shirts, trousers and sweaters. Their first boutique opened in 2000 in Frattamaggiore, Naples. Shortly afterwards, a new boutique was opened in Capri and another one in Miami, Florida. The product line Harmont & Blaine Junior was launched in 2005 by AGB Company, which owned the licence. In 2006, PDM was renamed to Harmont & Blaine. Many months after, a special meeting approved an assets increase on 1 October 2007. In 2008, the firm Giano signed a business deal for the production and distribution of a new product line of Harmont & Blaine, named Harmont & Blaine Shoes. The firm presented the Woman Collection in June 2010. During the same year, a co-branding operation with Honda resulted in the creation of a new car, the Honda CR-V Harmont & Blaine. Since 20122013, the design, production and distribution of new lines has moved to the direct management of the company. In June 2013, the Man Collection was announced to the press during Milan Fashion Week. After that, another flagship store was inaugurated in Prague in October. After many store openings all around the world, on 30 October 2014, Clessidra acquired 35% of Harmont & Blaine's stock, in order to support the plan of international growth of the firm. Harmont & Blaine expanded to other locations such as Prague, and Qatar through Abuissa Holding. According to its international development plan inside the French market, the firm established the subsidiary company Harmont & Blaine France and inaugurated its first boutique on 35 Boulevard des Capucines, Paris, in October 2015.
