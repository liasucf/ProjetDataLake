But Pothen is also singularly distinctive in his approach, which is a delectable medley of native roots (classy old-school) and modern kerala. In Maheshinte Prathikaram, Pothen charts a butterfly effect idiom through remarkable attention for detail and sensational film language, using every medium\u2015song, sky, rain, space, place and drama with consummated precision. == References == == External links == * Category:Malayalam film directors Category:Living people Category:1981 births Category:Film directors from Kochi Category:Male actors from Kochi Category:Male actors in Malayalam cinema Category:Indian male film actors Category:21st-century Indian male actors Category:Indian film actors Category:Indian film producers ",
