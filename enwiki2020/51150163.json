It was built by Edward Putnam (1710-1800) who came to Sutton in 1737 and established a 100-acre farm there. Edward Putnam was a first cousin of Rufus Putnam and a first cousin once removed of Israel Putnam, both of whom were generals in the American Revolutionary War.Benedict, William A. and Tracy, Hiram A. History of the Town of Sutton, Massachusetts from 1704 to 1876, pp. 223-4, Sanford & Co., Worcester, Massachusetts, 1878. The Putnam House still stands at 211 Putnam Hill Road, Sutton, Massachusetts. The house has a large central chimney, and a triple-run staircase which circumscribes the oven and chimney. The house has five fireplaces, five windows in each room, and five trees planted in front of the house to break westerly winds. The farm\u2019s large barn is close to the house and situated to break northeasterly winds. What is now the breakfast room was previously known as the death room. After a family member\u2019s death, caskets were brought through the door of this room because the design of the house made it almost impossible to navigate caskets through the front door.Kline, Karen. \"Home has storied past,\" Telegram & Gazette, Worcester, Massachusetts. Edward and Ruth Putnam had 12 children, all but one of whom were born in the house. The home remained in the Putnam family for the next 200 years.Benedict, William A. and Tracy, Hiram A.
