    "text": "The College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology has roots stretching back to an Information Science degree established in 1964. In 1988, Georgia Tech president John Patrick Crecine elevated the School of Information and Computer Science to become the College of Computing, making Georgia Tech the second university to do so, after Carnegie Mellon University created their School of Computer Science. Beyond using contemporary computer technology, the College of Computing also seeks new concepts and technology, with symbiotic connections to departments in other Colleges of Georgia Tech, in a holistic manner, such as combining with studies in human psychology, medical science, liberal arts, and business (e-commerce). The most prominent example of this interdisciplinary symbiosis is the College's Threads curriculum for its B.S. in Computer Science degree, launched in 2006. Another example is the degree program for B.S. in Computational Media is offered jointly and collaboratively within Georgia Tech's School of Literature, Media, and Communication in the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts. The College of Computing also has a tradition of a symbiosis between faculty and students: since the early years, older students have been assisting professors in research. Faculty members in the College of Computing have been receptive to new technology developed with students, rather than demanding outside ideas and \"Not Invented Here\" computer systems. In 2018, U.S. News & World Report ranked the Computer Science program #8 in the U.S. In 2016, Times Higher Education and the Wall Street Journal ranked the College #5 in the world. ==History== Klaus Advanced Computing Building ===Early years=== The history of Georgia Tech's College of Computing spans over 43 years. As a field of study, the concept began in 1963 when a group of faculty members led by Dr. Vladimir Slamecka and including Dr. Vernon Crawford, Dr. Nordiar Waldemar Ziegler, and Dr. William Atchison, noticed a symbiosis between departments. The group drafted an outline for a masters level program which combined library science, mathematics, and computer technology. Upon acceptance by the Georgia Tech administration, the M.S. in Information Science was first offered in 1964 under the School of Information Science at Georgia Tech led by Dr. Slamecka. In 1970, the school began offering a minor degree program for all Georgia Tech students, and was renamed to the School of Information and Computer Science (ICS). Two years later in 1972, ICS expanded to offer an undergraduate degree for students. It also partnered with Emory University to create a joint graduate program in Biomedical Information and Computer Science, the first partnership of its kind. In 1979, ICS's first director and primary founder, Dr. Slamecka, retired from the position after 15 years. Dr. Ray Miller, IBM's Assistant Director of Mathematical Sciences, was hired in his place. Under Miller, the School of Information and Computer Science began a trend which began to move away from information science and towards computer science. College of Computing Building ===College=== In John Patrick Crecine's 1988 reorganization of the Institute, the School was broadened as the College of Computing, one of the school's five (and in 1998, six) colleges. Georgia Tech was the first university in the United States to have a College of Computing. The school hired its first dean, Peter A. Freeman, in 1990, and further expanded in 2005 with more divisions. In 2000, successful internet entrepreneur and Tech alum Chris Klaus donated $15 million towards the construction of a new building for the college. At the time of Klaus' contribution, it was the fifth-largest contribution by an individual in Georgia Tech's history. The building was officially opened on October 26, 2006. ===Recent history=== In February 2007, the divisions were formalized into two schools: the School of Computer Science (SCS) and the School of Interactive Computing (SIC). In June 2008, College of Computing Dean Richard DeMillo announced plans for his resignation, citing conflicts with Georgia Tech provost and interim president Gary Schuster. DeMillo was temporarily replaced by James D. Foley, a professor in the School of Interactive Computing, until a permanent replacement could be found. On April 9, 2010, Zvi Galil was named the college's new dean. In March 2010, the division of Computational Science & Engineering (CSE) was also formalized into a school. The school is involved in DARPA's ADAMS project via the Proactive Discovery of Insider Threats Using Graph Analysis and Learning system. In May 2013, the school announced that it will offer the first professional Online Master of Science degree in computer science (OMSCS) that can be earned completely through the massive online (MOOC) format in partnership with Udacity. In August 2013, US President Barack Obama praised the school as \u201ca national leader in computer science\u201d that is offering a master's degree in computer science \u201cat a fraction of the cost\". In July 2019, Charles Lee Isbell, Jr. took over as dean, replacing Zvi Galil. ==Programs, Departments and Schools== * School of Computer Science * School of Interactive Computing * School of Computational Science & Engineering ==Facilities== *College of Computing Building *Klaus Advanced Computing Building *Technology Square Research Building ==Degrees== ===Undergraduate=== The College of Computing has evolved, along with advancing computing technology and applications, to offer an increasing variety of specialized degrees, including: * B.S. in Computer Science (a minor in Computer Science is also available) * B.S. in Computational Media (offered as a joint degree with the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts) ===Graduate=== The following graduate certificates are offered: * Graduate Certificate in Information Assurance (Interdisciplinary certificate offered jointly with the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering) * Graduate Certificate in Modeling and Computer Simulation Additionally, the following degrees are offered: * M.S. in Computer Science (which is also offered entirely online through the Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMS CS) program). * M.S. in Human-Computer Interaction * M.S. in Information Security * M.S. in Bioengineering * M.S. in Computational Science and Engineering (joint degree with the College of Engineering and the College of Sciences) ===Doctoral=== * Ph.D. in Computer Science''' * Ph.D. in Human- Centered Computing * Ph.D. in Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization * Ph.D. in Bioengineering (joint degree with the College of Engineering) * Ph.D. in Bioinformatics (joint degree with the School of Biology) * Ph.D. in Robotics (joint degree with the College of Engineering) * Ph.D. in Computational Science and Engineering (joint degree with the College of Engineering and the College of Sciences) * Ph.D. in Machine Learning (joint degree with multiple colleges) ==OMSCS== The Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) is a MOOC-based degree program leading to a fully accredited Masters qualification, presented in conjunction with Udacity. A contribution of $2 Million from AT&T; has funded the initial development of the program as well as continuing integration of technology. The program is designed and maintained to present a level of academic challenge entirely equivalent to a traditional MSCS course, with equivalent academic rigor as a founding principle. The estimate of the cost of studying the course is however very different; being in the region of $7,000 for a student completing the Masters course in 2 years; composed of the minimum 10 for graduation 3-credit- hour courses @ $510 per course plus $301 enrollment fee per semester for say 6 semesters. Although it is identical to the traditional MSCS program at Georgia Tech, transcripts of OMSCS students and alumni will list all classes taken with an \"O\" designation(\"O\" for online) as opposed to the transcripts of on- campus students which have the designation of \"A\"(\"A\" for Atlanta) The first semester of study, in Spring 2014, some 400 students were enrolled in the program. In January 2015 some 2,000 students were enrolled in the program. As of Spring 2020, enrollment had risen to over 9,500 students, and the program has produced about 3,500 graduates to date. Enrollment is accessible without restriction on the basis of citizenship, residence, or visa status, to students from all around the world. However, the vast majority of enrolled students are US citizens. The program does, however, mirror the gender imbalance found in many CS courses, with female students considerably outnumbered. ==Research== The College of Computing is the third-highest of Georgia Tech's six colleges (behind the larger and older College of Engineering and College of Sciences) in research awards, with 139 proposals worth $93,737,529 resulting in 119 awards worth $14,579,392 in 2006. There are several organizations tied to or within the College of Computing that are primarily dedicated to research. These include several research groups and labs. Other research-related organizations include: *GVU Center, which is primarily dedicated to computer graphics and human-computer interaction *Center for Experimental Research in Computer Systems, which focuses on hardware aspects of computer science *Georgia Tech Algorithms and Randomness Center ThinkTank *Center for Research into Novel Computing Hierarchies *Machine Learning at Georgia Tech ==Affiliated Research Institutes== *Institute for People and Technology *Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines *Institute for Information Security and Privacy *Institute for Data Engineering and Science ==Student life and community== The College of Computing has numerous student organizations which help build a community within the college.
