The west tower and the wall of the south aisle were rebuilt between 1757 and 1760. The chancel was restored in 1875. Most of the church is in Neoclassical style, other than the north aisle, which is Perpendicular. In the church is the fragment of a Saxon cross. ==References== Bibliography * ==External links== * Church website * A Church Near You entry Addingham Addingham Addingham ",
