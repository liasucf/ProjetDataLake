    "text": "Kevin John Hart (born 5 July 1954) is an Anglo-Australian theologian, philosopher and poet. He is currently Edwin B. Kyle Professor of Christian Studies and Chair of the Religious Studies Department at the University of Virginia. As a theologian and philosopher, Hart's work epitomizes the \"theological turn\" in phenomenology, with a focus on figures like Maurice Blanchot, Emmanuel Levinas, Jean-Luc Marion and Jacques Derrida. He has received multiple awards for his poetry, including the Christopher Brennan Award and the Grace Leven Prize for Poetry twice. ==Biography== Hart was born on 5 July 1954 to James Henry Hart and his wife, Rosina Mary Wooton. Hart's family moved to Brisbane, Australia, in 1966. Hart attended secondary school at Oxley State High School, and gained his Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy from the Australian National University. Hart received his PhD from the University of Melbourne in 1986. In 1991 he became Associate Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Monash University, rising to full Professor in 1995 and also becoming Director of the Centre for Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies and the Institute for Critical and Cultural Studies. He also taught in the Centre for Studies in Religion and Theology. Leaving Monash in 2002, he became Professor of Philosophy and Literature at the University of Notre Dame, a position he held until 2007, when he became Edwin B. Kyle Professor of Christian Studies at the University of Virginia, a position he holds as of 2019. ==Theology and literary criticism== In his professional life, Kevin Hart is primarily known as a theologian who works in two areas: systematic theology and religion and literature. His work in systematic theology has not yet been collected into volumes but remains as uncollected essays and chapters. In general, Hart's approach is to ground theology in a phenomenology of the Christ, both a phenomenology of Jesus's words and actions, and an account of Jesus as performing epoche and reduction, especially through the parables. On Hart's understanding, the preaching of the Kingdom brings forth Christ's death and that preaching is confirmed by the Resurrection. His work on the Christian mystical tradition is focused on practices of contemplation.Kevin Hart, \"Contemplation: Beyond and Beneath,\" Sophia 48 (2009), 435\u201359 In terms of religion and literature, Hart has written extensively on English and French poetry and Christianity, especially Christian mysticism. Recent work has converged on Geoffrey Hill.Kevin Hart, \"God\u2019s Little Mountains: Young Geoffrey Hill and the Problem of Religious Poetry,\" Sacred Worlds: Religion, Literature, and the Imagination (2009), ed. Mark Knight and Louise Lee (Continuum), 23\u201336; \"Transcendence in Tears,\" Gazing Through a Prim Darkly, ed. Keith Putt (New York: Fordham University Press, 2009), 116\u201338; and \"\u2019it / is true,\u2019\" Words of Life: New Theological Turns in French Phenomenology, ed. Bruce Benson and Norman Wirzba (Fordham University Press), 68\u201386. One facet of his work is extensive commentary on the writing of the atheist Maurice Blanchot to whom he has devoted four books: The Dark Gaze, The Power of Contestation, Nowhere without No, and Clandestine Encounters. Hart's analysis on Blanchot was praised by Peter Craven as combining \"an attractive expository technique with an openness to speculative ideas\". His work on Jacques Derrida and Samuel Johnson has also been praised, although one critic said that Hart's work on Johnson was \"dubious\" \"and inconsistent in approach\". ==Poetry== Hart's interests in poetry were piqued by an English teacher's presentation of Percy Bysshe Shelley's Ozymandias. In addition to Shelley, Hart also cites T. S. Eliot, Charles Baudelaire, Paul \u00c9luard, Vasko Popa, Zbigniew Herbert and Gerard Manley Hopkins as influences. He first began writing poetry as a teenager, partly thanks to a Shelley anthology he had purchased and partly as an excuse to enjoy the Public Library's air conditioning during Brisbane's hot summers. Critics have noted religious and philosophical themes in Hart's poetry.Paul Kane, \"Philosopher- Poets: John Koethe and Kevin Hart,\" Raritan 21: 1 (2001), 109\u2013110 As Toby Davidson writes, \"Kevin Hart's poetry cannot be separated from his multiple, enduring engagements with mysticism and mystical poetics. He is an innovator, suggesting new approaches to the mystical in the free facets of *attending*.\" Toby Davidson \"Beyond Reach of Language: Kevin Hart and Christian Mysticism,\" Literature and Theology 24: 3 (2010), 282 Michael Brennan notes that the philosophical connection stems out of Hart's \"long study into phenomenology\", specifically connecting Hart's \"The Room\" to Heidegger's philosophy.Michael Brennan, \"In Absentia: Mourning and Friendship,\" Jacket 27 (2005) Similarly, David McCooey detects the influence of Jacques Derrida, specifically Hart's use of metaphor and perspective. Erotic and sensual themes are also pronounced in Hart's work. Nathaniel O'Reilly notes, for example, that even though most criticism of Hart focuses on his religious themes, Hart is also an \"intensely physical and sensual poet\".Nathanael O'Reilly, IRWE 6: 2 (2010), 1 O'Reilly further says that Hart often links physical sensations with spiritual connections. Hart's volume Flame Tree was considered, then rejected, for the English Literature Victorian Certificate of Education in Victoria, Australia, on grounds of obscenity. The objectionable line was \"My semen hot and wild inside your cunt.\" In his own defense, Hart claimed, \"I was very surprised to think that the line could offend 18-year-olds these days. I suppose there will always be parents who are outraged about something in the curriculum.... In Australia \u2018cunt\u2019 is often used by lovers, women and men alike, and no offence need be given or taken. It can be said very tenderly....\" Paul Mitchell Interviews Kevin Hart ===Reception=== Hart's poetry has garnered multiple awards, including the Greybeal-Gowen Prize for Poetry in 2008, the John Shaw Neilson Poetry Award in 1977, the Mattara Poetry Award in 1982, 11the Wesley Michel Wright Award in 1984, the NSW Premier's Award in 1985, the Victorian Premier's Award in 1985, days wuiajathe Grace Leven Prize for Poetry in 1991 and 1996, the Christopher Brennan Award in 1999. Critical response to Hart's poetry has varied. Harold Bloom, writing on the back cover of Kevin Hart's 1999 volume of poetry, Wicked Heat, strongly praised Hart, saying that he is the \"most outstanding Australian poet of his generation\", and one of \"the major living poets in the English language\". Bloom also names Hart as one of the eleven canonical writers of Australia and New Zealand in his book, The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages, specifically praising Hart's book Peniel and Other Poems.Bloom, The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages (New York: Harcourt Brace, 1994), p 561 Other critics, such as Cyril Wong and Christian Sheppard, have also praised Hart's poetry. Some critics such as Geoffrey Lehmann and Pam Brown, however, have expressed negative views of Hart's work. while Christian Sheppard, reviewing the same volume, said \"The primary pleasure of Hart's poetry, however, is an easy rhythmed, swiftly flowing line tracing the moment-by-moment impressions of an often impassioned yet always lucid mind\". Lehmann, for instance, found Hart's 2008 volume, Young Rain to be self-indulgent and lacking in clear, specific meaning. Kevin Gardner, an American critic and professor, has noted that Hart\u2019s poems \"have an annoying tendency toward abstraction\" and a \"narcissistic symbolism\" that frustrates with \"surreal obfuscation.\" Examples from Hart's poems that Gardner cites include \"the curved eyelids of a young hand,\" \"you kiss / Like a slack orchid tongue in Cairns,\" death \"folded tightly / Like a parachute,\" \"let\u2019s eat the splinters in the house,\" \"And filch a little mouse called fear.\" ==Published works== ;Books of Poetry *The Departure, University of Queensland Press, 1978 *The Lines of Your Hand, Angus & Robertson, 1981, *Your Shadow, HarperCollins Publishers Australia, 1984, *Peniel Golvan Arts, 1991. *New and Selected Poems HarperCollins Publishers, 1995, *Dark Angel, Dedalus Press, 1996, *Nineteen Songs, Vagabond Press, 1999 *Wicked Heat Paper Bark Press, 1999, *Madonna, Vagabond Press, 2000 *Flame Tree Bloodaxe, 2002, *Night Music, Lexicon House, 2003 *Young Rain Bloodaxe Books, 2009, *Morning Knowledge, University of Notre Dame Press, 2011, ;Criticism *; Fordham Univ Press, 2000, *A.
