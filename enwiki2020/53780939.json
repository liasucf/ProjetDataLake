The single features an uncredited rap by M-Fuse and became Pandora's third top-5 single in Sweden, peaking at number 5 on the Swedish charts. ==Critical reception== Music & Media wrote in their review, \"Tell the world another talented Swedish singer has just stood up to be counted. The reggae set-up has Ace Of Base cleverness, while the singing is ABBA-esque and the rapper is the finishing Euro touch.\" Manila Standard commented that \"you are swept by the dizzying beat\" of the song. ==Track listing== *;CD Single # \"Tell the World\" (Radio Edit) - 3:37 # \"Tell the World\" (Extended Club Mix) - 5:29 *;CD Maxi # \"Tell the World\" (Radio Edit) - 3:37 # \"Tell the World\" (Extended Club Mix) - 5:29 # \"Tell the World\" (Straight Outta Kalahari) - 3:37 ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1994-1995) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA Charts) |247 |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |53 |- !scope=\"row\"|Finland (Finnish Singles Chart) |3 |- !scope=\"row\"|Israel (Israel Top-30) |28 |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1994) !scope=\"col\"|Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) |63 |- |} ==United DJ's vs. Pandora remix== \"Tell the World\" was re-released in July 2007 as the third single from United DJs vs. Pandora's album, Celebration (2007).
