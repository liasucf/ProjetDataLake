It was the third Kandyan War led by Keppetipola Disawe. ==Taxonomy== The species is closely related to C. pulchra. ==Ecology== The species was discovered from area lies between 380\u2013850 meters above sea level of Bambarabotuwa Forest Reserve. Individuals are restricted to rock outcrops and granite caves in forested areas. It is sympatric with many geckoes such as Cyrtodactylus sp., Gehyra mutilata, Hemidactylus depressus, H. frenatus and H. parvimaculatus. Researchers identified the species is Critically Endangered due to low numbers and density only recorded from six locations. ==Description== An adult male is 31.7 mm long. Dorsum homogeneous with smooth granular scales. Chin and gular scales are keeled whereas pectoral and abdominal scales are smooth. There are 23-25 belly scales across mid body. Tubercles on posterior flank are weakly developed. Para vertebral granules linearly arranged. Body short and slender. Head large and depressed. Snout relatively long. Pupil round. Head, body and limbs are light brown to golden yellow dorsally. There are five to six \"W\"-shaped, dark cross bands on trunk. There is an oblique black line between eye and nostrils. A dark line present on occipital area. Tail grey-white with 10-12 faded brown cross-bands. ==Media controversy== Several Sri Lankan media as well many parliamentarians criticized the usage of popular people's name for specific name. The argument was largely due to unknowing about binomial nomenclature in zoological taxonomy among people. They indicated that the usage of heroes' names gives by equating the national heroes to geckos. However, researchers neglect that sentence and explained that the name is given only to honor the personality. ==References== Category:Reptiles of Sri Lanka butewai Category:Reptiles described in 2019 ",
