    "text": "X-Change 3 is a Japanese erotic game produced by Crowd and distributed in English by Peach Princess. This game is the first in the series to be released on DVD-ROM, and the first to have the English release censored. It is the final chapter in the trilogy. The game was ported to DVD Game published by Blueberry Soft. ==Plot== In the third game, you play as Takuya Aihara for the last time. K\u014dji, a male student you had an encounter with in the first game, and who was in the chemistry club the previous game, is still trying to get Takuya's different side mixed with him. He secretly gets Asami Satoh to make more of the memory-change potion and proceeds to trick Takuya into getting it. ==Reception== On July 22, 2006, Peter Payne admitted that Peach Princess had censored the English release of X-Change 3. A total of seven graphics had been removed from the game due to them being of a lolicon nature. Two other graphics were edited to remove tears, blood, and other details from a rape scene. An unknown number of speech and sound effects were removed, and the amount of dialog changed during the translation/conversion is unknown. In addition, a sequence referring to the foreskin was deleted from a scene with two boys, but only audio and text were affected. Peach Princess later released a patch restoring some of the content. The rape sequence was put back in unedited, but the lolicon content was still left out. ==References== ==External links== *Peach Princess *Crowd Website Category:2004 video games Category:Bish\u014djo games Category:DVD interactive technology Category:Eroge Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Visual novels Category:Windows games ",
