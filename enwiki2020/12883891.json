    "text": "The Australian Endurance Championship is an Australian motor racing title which has been awarded by the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport in numerous years and for numerous categories since 1981. ==History== ===Touring cars=== The title was first contested as a championship for car manufacturers. Replacing the Australian Championship of Makes, which had been held from 1976 to 1980, it was decided over a series of endurance races for cars complying with CAMS Group C Touring Car regulations. In the years from 1982 to 1984, the winner of the Australian Endurance Championship was the most successful driver rather than the manufacturer. The Australian Endurance Championship of Makes, run concurrently with the drivers\u2019 title, was the new name for the manufacturers\u2019 award. For 1985 the manufacturers\u2019 title was again renamed, now becoming the Australian Manufacturers' Championship. The dual Australian Endurance Championship / Australian Manufacturers' Championship titles were contested in both 1985 and 1986 over a series of endurance races for cars complying with Australian Touring Car regulations, which were based on International Group A. No Australian Endurance Championship was awarded in the years from 1987 to 1989, however the Australian Manufacturers' Championship continued, now contested over the same series of sprint races as the Australian Touring Car Championship. In 1990 CAMS re-instated the Australian Endurance Championship, once again as a drivers\u2019 championship, run over a series of endurance races for Group 3A Touring Cars. The Australian Manufacturers' Championship title was moved back to this series in the same year, however this format was only utilised for two years and the titles were not contested in 1992. From 2013 onwards, an Enduro Cup was awarded to the drivers scoring the most championship points over the three two-driver endurance events in the Supercars Championship. ===Production cars=== The CAMS Australian Endurance Championship title was revived in 2011 and contested within the Australian Manufacturers' Championship from that year through to 2015.Title Results from the Australian Manufacturers Championship, www.cams.com.au, 2011 As archived at www.webcitation.org2015 CAMS Australian Manufacturers Championship \u2013 Sporting and Technical Regulations, www.camsmanual.com.au, as archived web.archive.org ===GT cars=== From 2016, the CAMS Australian Endurance Championship was contested by Australian GT cars.Australian GT confirms 2016 event formats, Speedcafe Retrieved 2 June 2016 The inaugural season included four 101 lap races, at Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit, Sydney Motorsport Park, Hampton Downs Motorsport Park and the Highlands 101 at Highlands Motorsport Park.

An alternate sanctioning body to CAMS, which ran the Australian Endurance Championship from 1981 to present, the AASA competition is not considered official or legitimate, and is not a recognised competition by the Australian Office of Sport. The AASA competition centered on placing a title across the otherwise disconnected events, which in 2013 saw its title \\awarded to highest point-scorer in the Wakefield 300 and Winton 300 endurance events. In 2014, it also included the Willowbank 300 at Queensland Raceway. This 3 event series was won by Justin Ruggier and Mark Mackay. ==See also== * Australian Manufacturers' Championship * Enduro Cup ==References== *Australian Motor Racing Yearbooks, 1981/82 to 1991/92 *CAMS Manual of Motor Sport, 1981 to 1991 ==External links== *www.cams.com.au ",
