At the ARIA Music Awards of 2012, Lane was nominated for fives awards. At the AIR Awards of 2012, Lane won the Best Independent Blues and Roots Album for To the Horses. ==Reception== A reviewer at JB HiFi said \"Adding sass to the smoky, sultry sounds of a bygone era, Lanie Lane is an undeniable talent who draws on the past and plants it very firmly in the here and now. Imbued with the spirit of Muddy Waters, and channeling the grit of Billie Holiday, Lanie Lane wraps the sounds of a golden age around a voice that is as rich and warm as it is sweet.\" ==Track listing== # \"Bang Bang\" - 2:04 # \"Betty Baby\" - 3:02 # \"Like Me Meaner\" - 3:38 # \"What Do I Do\" - 2:46 # \"What Trouble Is\" - 3:08 # \"That's What You Get\" (also known as \"(Oh Well) That's What You Get (Falling in Love with a Cowboy)\")\\- 2:57 # \"Jungle Man\" - 3:53 # \"The Devil's Sake\" - 3:13 # \"Don't Cry\" - 2:39 # \"Heartbeat\" - 4:47 # \"To the Horses\" - 3:18 # \"Ain't Hungry\" (bonus track) \\- 2:13 # \"My Man\" (bonus track) \\- 3:45 *All tracks written by Lanie Lane. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2011) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
