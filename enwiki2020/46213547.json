    "text": "The Vice-President of Namibia serves as the acting President of Namibia when the President is outside the country's borders, unable to fulfill the duties of the office, or when the Presidency is vacant. The Vice-President is also a member of the National Assembly and the Cabinet. The Vice-President is constitutionally required to 'assist the President in the execution of the functions of government,' and may be assigned any government portfolio by presidential proclamation. The position of Vice-President was established in 2014 along with several other constitutional amendments. The position is controversial due to its unclear portfolio. Nickey Iyambo served as the first Vice-President of Namibia from 2015 to 2018. The current Vice-President, appointed by President Hage Geingob is Nangolo Mbumba. ==Key== ;Political parties * ==List of officeholders== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:80px;\" | Portrait ! rowspan=\"2\" | Name ! colspan=\"3\" | Term of office ! rowspan=\"2\" | Political party |- !Took office !Left office !Time in office |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" | 1 | 80px |Nickey Iyambo | 21 March 2015 || 8 February 2018 | | SWAPO |- ! style=\"background:; color:white;\" | 2 | 80px |Nangolo Mbumba | 8 February 2018 || Incumbent | | SWAPO |} ==See also== *Namibia **Politics of Namibia **List of colonial governors of South-West Africa **President of Namibia **Prime Minister of Namibia **Cabinet of Namibia *Lists of Incumbents ==References== ==External links== *World Statesmen - Namibia Category:Government of Namibia Presidents Category:2014 establishments in Namibia Category:Vice Presidents of Namibia Namibia ",
