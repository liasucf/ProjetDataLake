    "text": "Remember the Future is the fourth album from English progressive rock band Nektar. Much like their debut album Journey to the Centre of the Eye, it is a concept album which is formally divided into ten tracks but in fact consists of one continuous piece of music. ==Release== Remember the Future was first released in 1973 by Bacillus (Bellaphon). The album was re-released in 1990 on LP and CD by Germany's Bellaphon. The mix used for this release was the LP mix that was rejected. In 2002 Bellaphon remastered the album from the original tapes and reissued it on CD with two bonus tracks, which were Radio Promo edits. This was the first time that the correct LP mixes were released on CD. In 2004 Remember the Future was once again re-released, but this time by the UK's Eclectic Discs/Dream Nebula Recordings. For this reissue the remastered version was used and they added a third Radio edit of the title track. This version was also released as a SACD, which includes a 5.1 surround mix (which was actually the original 1973 quadraphonic mix with derived center and LFE channels added); the 2 channel audio CD layer contains the 2002 remix. Track 3 (\"Remember the Future\") is an edit released on a various artists compilation album titled \"Made In Germany.\" Tracks 4 and 5 are radio promo only single edits. In 2014, Cleopatra Records issued a 3-CD set of the original album, plus a bonus material CD and a CD consisting of rehearsals of new material the band recorded in 1974 at Chipping Norton studios. == Track listing == All songs written by Nektar. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Chart (1973-75) !Position |- |United States (Billboard 200) |align=\"center\"|19 |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) |align=\"center\"|72 |} ==Personnel== *Allan \"Taff\" Freeman \u2013 keyboards, backing vocals, production *Roye Albrighton \u2013 guitars, lead vocals, production *Derek \"Mo\" Moore \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals, production *Ron Howden \u2013 drums, percussion, backing vocals, production *Mick Brockett \u2013 lights, production *Peter Hauke - production *Barry Hammond - engineer ==References== ==External links== * Nektar The Legendary Rock Band at nektarsmusic.com Category:Nektar albums Category:1973 albums Category:Rock operas ",
