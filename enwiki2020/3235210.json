    "text": "Capital punishment is a legal penalty in the state of Texas, part of the United States. In 1982, the state became the first jurisdiction in the world to carry out an execution by lethal injection, when it put to death Charles Brooks Jr.. It was the first execution in the state since 1964. Texas, which is the second most populous state of the Union, has executed 570 offenders from the U.S. capital punishment resumption in 1976 (beginning in 1982 with the Brooks execution) to July 8, 2020 (the execution of Billy Joe Wardlow), more than a third of the national total. ==History== The first execution in Texas occurred in 1819 with the execution of a white male, George Brown, for piracy. In 1840, a free black male, Henry Forbes, was executed for jail- breaking. Prior to Texas statehood in 1846, eight executions\u2014all by hanging\u2014were carried out. Ellis Unit, which at one time housed the State of Texas male death row Upon statehood, hanging would be the method used for almost all executions until 1924. Hangings were administered by the county where the trial took place. The last hanging in the state was that of Nathan Lee, a man convicted of murder and executed in Angleton, Brazoria County, Texas on August 31, 1923. The only other method used at the time was execution by firing squad, which was used for three Confederate deserters during the American Civil War as well as a man convicted of attempted rape in 1863. In 1853 the first execution in Houston took place in public at Founder's Cemetery in the Fourth Ward; initially the cemetery was the execution site, but post-1868 executions took place in the jail facilities. Texas changed its execution laws in 1923, requiring the executions be carried out on the electric chair and that they take place at the Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville (also known as Huntsville Unit). From 1928 until 1965, this was also home to the state's male death row. The first executions on the electric chair were on February 8, 1924, when Charles Reynolds, Ewell Morris, Harris Washington, Haden Cochran, and Melvin Johnson had their death sentences carried out. The five executions were the most carried out on a single day in the state. The state would conduct multiple executions on a single day on several other occasions, the last being on August 9, 2000. Since then, the state has not executed more than one person on a single day, though there is no law prohibiting it. A total of 361 people were electrocuted in Texas, with the last being Joseph Johnson on July 30, 1964. The United States Supreme Court decision in Furman v. Georgia (), which declared Georgia's \"unitary trial\" procedure (in which the jury was asked to return a verdict of guilt or innocence and, simultaneously, determine whether the defendant would be punished by death or life imprisonment) to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it was a cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, essentially negated all death penalty sentences nationwide. As result of the Furman decision, the 52 Texas death-row inmates at the time had all their sentences reduced to life imprisonment. Among them was Kenneth McDuff, who was originally condemned for the murder of three teenagers in 1966. He was paroled in 1989 and executed in 1998 for a murder he committed while on parole, and is suspected to have been responsible for many other killings. Furman led to a 1973 revision of the laws, primarily by introducing the bifurcated trial process (where the guilt- innocence and punishment phases are separate) and narrowly limiting the legal definition of capital murder (and, thus, those offenses for which the death penalty could be imposed). The first person sentenced to death under a new Texas statute was John Devries on February 15, 1974; Devries hanged himself in his cell on July 1, 1974 (using bedsheets from his bunk) before he could be executed. The Supreme Court decision in Jurek v. Texas in 1976 once again allowed for the death penalty to be imposed. (Jurek was a companion case in the Gregg decision and was upheld by the Court; the Court stated that Texas' death penalty scheme could potentially result in fewer death penalty cases, an irony given that post-Gregg Texas has by far executed more inmates than any other state.) However, the first execution in Texas after this decision would not take place until December 7, 1982 with that of Charles Brooks, Jr.. Brooks was also the first person to be judicially executed by lethal injection in the world, and the first African American to be executed in the United States since 1967. In the post-Gregg era, Texas has executed 570 people. There are a variety of proposed legal and cultural explanations as to why Texas has more executions than any other state. One possible reason is due to the federal appellate structure - federal appeals from Texas are made to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Michael Sharlot, dean of the University of Texas at Austin Law School, found the Fifth Circuit to be a \"much more conservative circuit\" than the Ninth Circuit to which federal appeals from California are made. According to him, the Fifth is \"more deferential to the popular will\" that is strongly pro-death penalty and creates few legal obstacles to execution within its jurisdiction.As quoted in Robert Bryce, \"Why Texas is Execution Capital,\" The Christian Science Monitor, December 14, 1998. As of 2004, however, Texas may have a lower rate of death sentencing than other states, according to a study by Cornell University.\"Cornell study reveals surprising findings on death row, race and the most death penalty-prone states.\" Cornell University. February 26, 2004. Retrieved on May 9, 2010. Texas has executed nine women in its history, the most recent being Lisa Ann Coleman on September 17, 2014. ==Capital crimes== Under Texas statutes, a murder is capital if the offender:Texas Penal Code \u00a7 19.03 #Murders a public safety officer (police officer, fireman, or EMT/paramedic) who is acting in the lawful discharge of an official duty and who the person knows is a police officer or fireman. There are current bills proposed to add EMT/paramedics. #Intentionally commits the murder in the course of committing or attempting to commit aggravated kidnapping, burglary, robbery, aggravated sexual assault, arson, obstruction or retaliation, or terroristic threat #Commits the murder for remuneration or the promise of remuneration or employs another to commit the murder for remuneration or the promise of remuneration #Commits the murder while escaping or attempting to escape from a penal institution #Commits the murder, while incarcerated, of a person who is employed in the operation of the penal institution or with the intent to establish, maintain, or participate in a combination (In Criminal Law, an agreement between two or more people to act jointly for an unlawful purpose; a conspiracy.) or in the profits of a combination #Commits the murder while incarcerated for murder; or while serving a sentence of life imprisonment or a term of 99 years for aggravated kidnapping, aggravated sexual assault or aggravated robbery #Murders more than one person during the same criminal transaction or during different criminal transactions but the murders are committed pursuant to the same scheme or course of conduct #Murders an individual under 15 years of age #Murders another person in retaliation for or on account of the service or status of the other person as a judge or justice of the supreme court, the court of criminal appeals, a court of appeals, a district court, a criminal district court, a constitutional county court, a statutory county court, a justice court, or a municipal court. Texas statute books still provide the death penalty for aggravated sexual assault committed by an offender previously convicted of the same against a child under 14. Under Texas law, offenders under 17 are not executed but the US Supreme Court in Roper v. Simmons has ruled capital punishment to be unconstitutional for those under 18 when the crime was committed. The highest age of a child murder victim, which can subject the murderer to the death penalty, was raised from six to 10 in 2011 by the Texas legislature then raised once again to 15 in 2019 (Lauren's Law). ==Legal procedure== The prosecution may choose not to seek the death penalty. This can be for various reasons, such as the prosecution believing that they could not show the defendant worthy of death, or the family of the victim has asked that the death penalty not be imposed. ===Trial phase=== When the prosecution seeks the death penalty, the sentence is decided by the jury. A death sentence must be unanimous, while a life sentence requires only 10 votes. In case of a hung jury during the penalty phase of the trial, a life sentence is issued, even if a single juror opposed death (there is no retrial). Jurors in the sentencing phase are first asked to determine whether the defendant represents a \"future danger to society:In this context, \"society\" refers not only to the general public at large but also to the prison system; thus, a defendant who would pose a danger to those in prison -- such as other inmates, guards, or prison workers -- would be eligible for the death penalty.; only after ruling that \"there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society\" will the jury choose the sentence itself, by deciding whether there is \"sufficient mitigating circumstance or circumstances to warrant that a sentence of life imprisonment without parole rather than a death sentence be imposed\" or not. === Appeals === The imposition of a death sentence in Texas results in an automatic direct appeal to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state's court of last resort for criminal cases (the intermediate Texas Courts of Appeals are bypassed). A person convicted of capital murder may also challenge their convictions or sentences via writs of habeas corpus at both the state and federal levels. Texas's appeal process has been criticized as too lengthy compared to other states such as Virginia by death penalty supporters. In 2016, the legal director for the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation Kent Scheidegger said: \"In Texas, part of the problem is some cases go back for a second review to the trial court and some trial courts just sit on them for years. That simply shouldn't be allowed.\" ===Clemency=== In addition to seeking judicial review of the sentence, a defendant may also appeal to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, a separate agency from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ), for commutation of the sentence to life in prison. The Board, after hearing testimony, decides whether or not to recommend commutation to the Governor of Texas. If the Board recommends commutation, the Governor can accept or reject the recommendation. However, if the board does not recommend commutation, the Governor has no power to override the Board's non-recommendation (the law was changed in 1936 due to concerns that pardons were being sold for cash under the administrations of former Governor James E. Ferguson and later his wife and Texas's first female Governor Miriam A. Ferguson).Texas State Libraries and Archives Commission: \"Pardons and Paroles\" retrieved October 20, 2011 The only unilateral action which the Governor can take is to grant a one-time, 30-day reprieve to the defendant, and can do so regardless of what the Board recommends in a particular case.Texas Administrative Code Title 37 PUBLIC SAFETY AND CORRECTIONS, Part 5 TEXAS BOARD OF PARDONS AND PAROLES, Chapter 143 EXECUTIVE CLEMENCY, Subchapter E COMMUTATION OF SENTENCE, Rule 143.57 Commutation of Death Sentence to Lesser Penalty retrieved August 20, 2011The Texas Constitution: Sec. 11.

Under Texas law, executions are carried out at or after 6 p.m. Huntsville (Central) time \"by intravenous injection of a substance or substances in a lethal quantity sufficient to cause death and until such convict is dead\". The law does not specify the substance(s) to be used; previously, according to the TDCJ, the chemicals used for the lethal injection were the commonly-used three-drug combination of (in order) sodium thiopental (a dose which sedates the offender, but not enough to kill outright), pancuronium bromide (a muscle relaxant which collapses the diaphragm and lungs), and potassium chloride (which stops the heartbeat). The offender is usually pronounced dead approximately seven minutes after start of the injection process; the cost for the three substances is $86.08 per offender. As a result of drug shortages, sodium thiopental was replaced by pentobarbital in 2011. Further shortages of this drug have pushed the cost of the drugs to approximately $1300 per offender. Still further shortages of pancuronium bromide (and the expiration of the existing stock) forced the state into switching to a single-drug protocol, using solely pentobarbital. The only persons legally allowed to be present (none of whom can be convicts) at the execution are: *the executioner \"and such persons as may be necessary to assist him in conducting the execution\" *the Board of Directors of the Department of Corrections *two physicians including the prison physician *the spiritual advisor of the condemned *the chaplains of the Department of Corrections *the county judge and sheriff of the county in which the crime was committed *no more than five relatives or friends of the condemned person In response to victims rights groups, TDCJ adopted a board rule in January 1996 allowing five victim witnesses (six for multiple victims). Initially the witnesses were limited to immediate family and individuals with a close relationship to the victim, but the board rule was modified in 1998 to allow close friends of surviving witnesses, and further modified in May 2008 to allow the victim witnesses to be accompanied by a spiritual advisor who is a bona fide pastor or comparable official of the victim's religion. ===Media coverage=== Five members of the media are also allowed to witness the execution, divided equally as possible between the rooms containing the offender's and victim's witnesses. Under current TDCJ guidelines, representatives of the Associated Press and The Huntsville Item (the local newspaper for Huntsville, Texas) are guaranteed two of the five slots to witness an execution. () \"C. A representative from the Associated Press (AP) and a representative from the Huntsville Item are guaranteed an opportunity to witness each execution.\" The Associated Press regularly sends a representative to cover executions; Michael Graczyk (formerly of the AP's Houston office; though retired from the AP he still reports on executions on a freelance basis) is usually the representative sent, having attended over 400 executions in his career. The Item also generally covers all executions, regardless of county of conviction. Other media members must submit their requests at least three days prior to the execution date; priority will be given to media members representing the area in which the capital crime took place. Generally, other newspapers will only cover executions where the crime was committed within their general circulation area (the Houston Chronicle is often one of them, with Harris County being the state's largest and having the most number of inmates on death row), and frequently even then will rely on the AP report. College and university media are not permitted to be witnesses. ===Post-execution=== Captain Joe Byrd Cemetery in Huntsville, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice prison cemetery for deceased prisoners, including executed prisoners, who are not reclaimed by their families Upon the offender's death the body shall be immediately embalmed, and shall be disposed of as follows: *A relative or bona fide friend of the offender may demand or request the body within 48 hours after death, upon payment of a fee not to exceed US$25 for the mortician's services in embalming the deceased; once TDCJ receives the receipt the body shall be released to the requestor or his/her authorized agent. *If no relative or bona fide friend requests the body, the Anatomical Board of the State of Texas may request the body, but must also pay the US$25 fee for embalming services and TDCJ must receive the receipt prior to delivery. *If no relative, bona fide friend, or the Anatomical Board requests the body, TDCJ shall cause the body to be \"decently buried\" with the embalming fee to be paid by the county in which the indictment resulting in the conviction occurred. The TDCJ keeps an online record of all of its executions, including race, age, county of origin, and last words. The TDCJ is the only corrections agency in the US to extensively catalog the last words of executed inmates, and the only one to post the last words other than the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR).Fernandez, Manny. \"From America\u2019s Busiest Death Chamber, a Catalog of Last Rants, Pleas and Apologies.\" The New York Times.

In 2009, a report conducted by Dr. Craig Beyler, hired by the Texas Forensic Science Commission to review the case, found that \"a finding of arson could not be sustained\". Beyler said that key testimony from a fire marshal at Willingham's trial was \"hardly consistent with a scientific mind-set and is more characteristic of mystics or psychics\u201d.Full Text of Report on Analysis of Arson Fire Investigation in Todd Willingham Case | Texas Moratorium Network (August 2009) Governor Rick Perry expressed skepticism of Beyler's findings.

Since DeLuna's execution by lethal injection, doubts have been raised about the conviction and the question of his guilt. An investigation published by the Columbia Human Rights Law Review in May 2012 has strengthened these claims of innocence by detailing a large amount of evidence suggesting the actual murderer was Carlos Hernandez, a similar- looking man who lived in a nearby neighborhood. ===Frances Newton=== Frances Newton was executed in 2005 despite much doubt about her guilt, and much confusion over the actual weapon used in the murder(s) for which she was sentenced to death. ===Johnny Frank Garrett=== Johnny Frank Garrett was executed in 1992 for killing 76-year-old nun Tadea Benz in Amarillo in 1981. In 2004, after DNA-analyses, Leoncio Perez Rueda was found to be the murderer of Narnie Box Bryson, who was killed four months before Sister Benz. After being confronted, the murderer confessed to killing Bryson. Rueda is also believed to have been the real murderer of Sister Benz. ==Execution of Mexican nationals== Five Mexican nationals have been recently executed in Texas \u2013 Jos\u00e9 Medell\u00edn in 2008, Humberto Leal Garc\u00eda in 2011, \u00c9dgar Tamayo \u00c1rias in 2014, Rub\u00e9n C\u00e1rdenas Ram\u00edrez in 2017, and Roberto Moreno Ramos in 2018.

At the time of their arrests in the early 1990s, neither had been informed of their rights as Mexican nationals to have the Mexican consulate informed of the charges and provide legal assistance. A 2004 ruling by the International Court of Justice concluded that the U.S. had violated the rights of 51 Mexican nationals, including Medell\u00edn and Garc\u00eda, under the terms of a treaty the U.S. had signed. In response to the ruling, the Bush administration issued an instruction that states comply, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it had exceeded its authority. The Supreme Court also ruled in Medellin v. Texas that the treaty was not binding on states until Congress enacted statutes to implement it, and in Leal Garcia v. Texas declined to place a stay on the executions in order to allow Congress additional time to enact such a statute. A 2008 ruling by the International Court of Justice asked the United States to place a stay on the executions, but Texas officials stated that they were not bound by international law. Garc\u00eda supporters complained about the use of bite mark analysis and luminol in determining his guilt. However, Garc\u00eda accepted responsibility for the crimes and apologized before his execution. Regarding the Garc\u00eda execution, Texas Governor Rick Perry stated that \"If you commit the most heinous of crimes in Texas, you can expect to face the ultimate penalty under our laws.\" ==See also== *Capital punishment in the United States *Lists of people executed in Texas *List of death row inmates in Texas *Michael Graczyk, former Houston-based reporter for the Associated Press (now retired but working on a freelance basis), who has witnessed over 400 executions in Texas as the AP's designated representative *Crime in Texas *Law of Texas ==Further reading== *Harnsberger, R.
