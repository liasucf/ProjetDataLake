    "text": "The Lucid Air is an electric car whose prototype was unveiled by Lucid Motors in December 2016. , it was being designed to compete with existing brands in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, in particular the Tesla Model S, the Porsche Taycan, as well as other brands in the luxury car segment, including Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi. The Air sedan is estimated to achieve an EPA- rated range of on a single charge, a record for EVs. The production version was unveiled in September 2020, and Lucid plans to put the car into production in the spring of 2021. __TOC__ == History == The Lucid Air was conceived in the early 2010s, with a prototype unveiled to the public in 2016, and the production version unveiled in September 2020 with production planned to start in spring 2021. Lucid entered into a partnership deal with Samsung SDI on 2 December 2016 for battery procurement. In 2016, Lucid Motors created a delivery van prototype of its electric powertrain for the Air using batteries from its former brand, Atieva. Known as \"Edna\", the electric powered delivery van contained two gearboxes and motors capable of storing 87 kWh of energy, and producing over . Combined with all-wheel drive, other physical and software updates, Edna was able to achieve a 0-60 mph (97 km/h) time of 2.74 seconds and quarter mile time of 11.3 seconds. According to Lucid Motors, Edna was used to test the performance and real world functionality of its powertrain, including \"motor control algorithms, regenerative braking behaviors, accelerator pedal feel, and cooling strategies\". Laguna Seca - In 2018, Lucid Motors set a new record with the Air, achieving a time of 1:39.30 In 2018, an Air prototype set an EV lap record of 1:41.67 at the Laguna Seca track with a modified Lucid Air, beating the Jaguar I Pace by seven seconds, previously holding a previous record of 1:48.18. Featured as a prototype, the Air was equipped with \"Pirelli P Zero PZ4 summer tyres, modified high temperature brake pads and fluid, a 6 point roll cage and fire suppression system\". According to Lucid Motors, these modifications had little impact on the production weight of the car, differing only a few percent. In 2018, Lucid Motors closed a investment deal with the Saudi Arabia to fund the Air's production. Production was then expected to commence in late 2020 following the construction of the Lucid factory in Casa Grande, Arizona. The factory's total investment was expected to amount to by 2025 when all phases are complete, with the first phase including a investment in equipment and investment in property acquisition. By May 2019, the Air was available for pre-order in the United States and Canada, with plans stated to move to other markets in the near future, with a focus on China. In an interview, Peter Rawlinson stated that China would pose as a significant market for Lucid Motors due to their intensive usage patterns, which the Air is best suited for. In a 2019 interview, Peter Rawlinson outlined that the US$100,000 plus vehicle could be seen as the first stage of a much bigger vision, which is to achieve a level of energy efficiency that combined with an ubiquitous fast charging network, will counteract the need for bigger sized batteries. Rawlinson specified that Lucid Motors aims to improve energy efficiency to be / kWh as opposed to an industry average of / kWh. Rawlinson further outlined then that the price of batteries was expected to drop to US$100 / kWh within the next decade, which he believes will enable Lucid Motors to produce a luxury EV for less than US$30,000. On June 30, 2020, Lucid Motors said that they expected the Lucid Air to be \"the world's most aerodynamically efficient luxury car when it goes into production later this year.\" The company \"achieved a new benchmark in aerodynamic efficiency for its luxury electric car...with tests recently completed at Windshear's advanced rolling-road wind tunnel, the automaker verified a coefficient of drag of 0.21.\" On July 29, 2020, Lucid Motors announced DreamDrive, the Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS) which will debut in the Air. DreamDrive will offer most comprehensive sensor suite on the market, with 32 sensors in total, including \"14 cameras: Three forward-facing, four side- and rear-facing, four surround-view, a rear- facing, a rear-facing fisheye, and lastly, a driving monitoring one. There are five radar units. One is a forward-facing long-range sensor, and the other four are short-range ones. Twelve short-range ultrasonic sensors handle near- field detection, and lastly, a high-resolution, long-range, 125-beam (equivalent), forward-facing Lidar maps the three-dimensional space ahead of the car.\" == Design == The Air has been designed to compete in the luxury sports segment against the Tesla Model S as well as high-line models from German car manufacturers. Its goal is to match the ability of sport coupes, but has a greater interior space, with a smaller external length and width. === Range === On August 11, 2020, Lucid Motors unveiled that the Air is estimated to achieve an EPA range of on a single charge. The results were verified by engineering consulting firm FEV North America. This is 28% higher than the EPA range of for the Tesla Model S Long Range, which has the highest current EV range although a smaller battery. The milestone is attributed to \"Lucid\u2019s in-house electric motors, design and aerodynamics, among other things...the company also cited the experience of its Atieva technology division, which supplies battery packs to the Formula E electric racing circuit.\" === DreamDrive (ADAS) === DreamDrive Advanced Driver-Assistance System with 14 cameras: three forward-facing, four side- and rear-facing, four surround-view, a rear-facing, a rear-facing fisheye, a drive-monitoring camera. There are five radar units. === Aerodynamics === The Air has an industry-leading drag coefficient of 0.21. === Powertrain === Lucid Motors will use lithium-ion battery cells sourced from Samsung SDI as the Air's primary powertrain. The base Air will be equipped with a 75 kWh battery with rear wheel drive, capable of producing , of torque and of range. A larger version of the Air will have a 110 kWh battery pack which will provide an estimated of EPA range. It will have all-wheel drive with a combined . This version of the Air will be able to accelerate from 0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 2.5 seconds. In their most recent performance test, the larger Air achieved a top speed of . According to Lucid Motors, the production model of the larger Air will be capable of a top speed over . The Air has a rated energy efficiency of 21.4 kWh/, or 2.89 miles/kWh, which is equivalent to 2.4 litres/100 km in fuel. === Charging === Lucid Motors plans to offer a nationwide charging plan to customers in the US through its joint agreement with Electrify America, using a 900 volt system. In the first phase of its construction, Electrify America will offer \"more than 2,000 fast charging stations over 500 sites, spread out across 40 states and 17 major metropolitan areas\". In a 2019 interview with Lucid Motors Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Peter Rawlinson recognized fast charging capability as a priority due to the emergence of more intense usage patterns and demand for \"stop-and-go\" fast charging as a result of time constraints among consumers. Lucid Motors claims that its 2170 cells differ significantly from normal lithium ion cells due to their tolerance of repeated cyclic fast charging and non-use for a prolonged period of time without losing capacity. Furthermore, Lucid Motors claims that their cars will have reverse charging functionality. == Features == Lucid plans to eventually make the Air available in four models: the Lucid Air Dream Edition, Air Grand Touring, Air Touring, and the base model Air; but will begin production in 2021 with the limited edition Air Dream. The base model will be equipped with a single motor, rear wheel drive setup, producing and range, and won't go into production until 2022. Other standard features include: \"LED headlights, all the necessary hardware for autonomous driving, four high resolution screens (three of which are touch sensitive), 19-inch alloy wheels, 10 speaker sound system, 12-way power adjustment for the front seats, front and rear trunk with a total luggage space of around , and over-the-air software updates.\" The Air can be optioned with improved battery packs that will offer either or , as well as a dual motor, all-wheel drive powertrain producing up to for the top of the range. Other options include: \"active suspension, a panoramic sunroof, executive rear seats that can recline up to 55 degrees, a 29 speaker sound system with noise cancellation, 21-inch alloy wheels, and front seats with heating, ventilation, dynamic bolsters, massage and 22-way electric adjustment.\" As of 2019, up to 255 limited edition Air cars could be reserved, which were to come equipped with dual performance motors and optional extras. ==References== ==Further reading== * Felton, Ryan.
