    "text": "''''' (\"South German Monthly\", also credited as ') was a German magazine published in Munich between January 1904 and September 1936. After beginnings as an art and literary venue, liberal but highly critical of modernism, it made a turn toward politics before World War I. Especially supportive of German conservatism, it was also sympathetic toward V\u00f6lkisch ideologists, and published propaganda in favor of militarist politicians such as Alfred von Tirpitz. Having for its founder and editor Paul Nikolaus Cossmann, an assimilated Jew, ' was generally antisemitic\u2014strongly so after 1920, when it hosted calls for racial segregation. Its publication of conspiracy theories such as the stab-in-the-back myth paved the way for Nazi propaganda, but ' was more closely aligned with the mainstream right. It played a part in conspiratorial alliances supporting the policies of Gustav von Kahr, although it also had Conservative Revolutionaries among its core contributors. In its late years, ' turned to Bavarian nationalism and Wittelsbach loyalism, becoming a target for the Nazi regime. Cossmann was imprisoned for dissidence, then deported for his Jewishness; took over, leading ' until its disestablishment in 1936. ==Beginnings== Established as a mainly social- liberal tribune by Cossmann, a Jewish writer who had converted to Catholicism, ' initially sought to reaffirm the cultural importance of Southern Germany and solidify its symbiotic relationship with Prussia, creating cultural bridges between Catholics and Protestants.Alexandre, pp. 195\u2013196, 210\u2013212 Joining the directorial staff in the first edition was liberal pastor-politician Friedrich Naumann (its political director to 1913),Alexandre, p. 196, 199\u2013200, 210\u2013212 who shared editorial oversight with painter Hans Thoma and composer Hans Pfitzner.\"Chronique allemande\", Biblioth\u00e8que Universelle et Revue Suisse, Vol. 39, Issue 115, pp. 635\u2013636 Protestant social reformer and Joseph Schnitzer, a Modernist Catholic, were noted guest writers, with Cossmann acting as neutral host.Alexandre, pp. 196\u2013198 During the federal election of 1907, the magazine hosted debates between Schnitzer and Center Party militant , on Political Catholicism and its role in society (a divisive one, according to Schnitzer).Alexandre, p. 206 However, according to historian Adam R. Seipp, ' was mainly an interface for traditional Munich\u2014Catholic, \"deeply conservative\", \"suspicious of outside influences\", and antithetical to the modernist Simplicissimus.Adam R. Seipp, The Ordeal of Peace: Demobilization and the Urban Experience in Britain and Germany, 1917\u20131921, p. 39. Farnham: Ashgate Publishing, 2009. Cossmann managed to attract important writers to the magazine's permanent staff, including and Karl Alexander von M\u00fcller. In its early issues, ' hosted mainly essays by the likes of Hofmiller (such as his 1909 putdown of the modernist author Robert Walser),Bernhard F. Malkmus, The German Picaro and Modernity: Between Underdog and Shape-shifter, p. 65. New York: Continuum International Publishing Group, 2011. Carl Spitteler, and Karl Voll, and poetry by . Some of the cultural and social chronicles had nationalist undertones, debating over the requirements of German modernization. As Anglophiles, Hofmiller, Lujo Brentano, and suggested fusing Anglo\u2013American lessons in modernity with the German Volkstum, to make Germany a more competitive capitalist nation; in 1906, a Dr. Paul Tesdorf went further, promoting eugenics as a means to engineer a better people.Alexandre, pp. 197\u2013198, 200\u2013202 In contrast, Naumann and other authors worried about finance capitalism and oligopolies, exhorting a German nationalism based on \"democratic capitalism\" or syndicalism, and following closely the development of Marxist revisionism.Alexandre, pp. 202\u2013204. See also Struve, p. 90 In a February 1906 obituary for the \"legal socialist\" Anton Menger, Eugen Ehrlich commented that the term \"socialism\" had virtually lost its mystique.Thilo Ram, \"Juristensozialismus in Deutschland\", in Quaderni Fiorentini per la Storia del Pensiero Giuridico Moderno, Vols. 3\u20134 (\"Il 'Socialismo giuridico': ipotesi e letture. I\"), 1974\u20131975, p. 15 The magazine took a distinctly liberal position on education reform, with Rade supporting the Jewish studies movement.Christian Wiese, \"'The Best Antidote to Anti-Semitism'?

Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2007. Most of the contributors, in particular Gustav Wyneken, were critics of the Herbartian educational tradition; Wyneken's polemics with the more conservative Friedrich Wilhelm Foerster were taken up by '.Alexandre, pp. 207\u2013208 In 1909, the journal was also one of the first to host Hans Driesch's philosophical tracts, discussing the concept of becoming in history and nature.Caterina Zanfi, Bergson e la filosofia tedesca, 1907\u20131932, p. 151. Macerata: Quodlibet, 2013. In 1913, it aired Moritz Geiger's grievances against experimental psychology, implicitly a defense of classical phenomenology.Martin Kusch, Psychologism. A Case Study in the Sociology of Philosophical Knowledge, p. 195. London: Routledge, 1995. Debates about innovation were carried into the artistic realm. An early contributor, Henry Thode, wrote articles which censured modern art from conservative and antisemitic positions, attacking modernist critics such as Julius Meier-Graefe.Thomas W. Gaehtgens, \"Les rapports de l'histoire de l'art et de l'art contemporain en Allemagne \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de W\u00f6lfflin et de Meier- Graefe\", Revue de l'Art, Vol. 88, 1990, pp. 35, 38 In 1911, the debate was taken further: ' hosted both 's manifesto against French \"invasion\" in German art, as well as the more cautious, pro-modernist, replies to Vinnen, from: Thoma, Lovis Corinth, Gustav Klimt, Max Klinger, Max Slevogt, Count Kalckreuth, Wilhelm Tr\u00fcbner, and Auguste Rodin.\"Revue des revues.

Suppl\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Gazette des Beaux-arts, No. 23/1911, p. 182 In various other issues, ' carried polemical essays by aestheticists such as Heinz Politzer, \"Rudolf Borchardt, Poet of Assimilation. The Extreme Case of an Extreme Tendency\", in Commentary, January 1950 and Paul Zarifopol.Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic\u021bionarul biografic al literaturii rom\u00e2ne, Vol. II, p. 868.

Naumann resigned in protest against veiled accusations him in P\u00f6hlmann's article, but also because the magazine had discarded liberal democracy.Alexandre, pp. 211\u2013212 ' saluted the July 1914 Crisis and the outbreak of World War I: in the September issue, Karl Mayr wrote that the war signified \"internal transformation\".Verhey, p. 4 The magazine's nationalism became extreme over the following months, with Cossmann arguing in favor of ' (\"victory peace\")Cahnman, p. 107 and M\u00fcller celebrating Prussia as a \"heroic-aristocratic warrior state\";John C. G. R\u00f6hl, \"Hof und Hofgesellschaft unter Kaiser Wilhelm II.\", in Pariser Historische Studien, Vol. 21, 1985, p. 257 similarly, Hermann Oncken and Friedrich Meinecke wrote praises of militarism and Prussian virtues.Christoph Corneli\u00dfen, \"Politische Historiker und deutsche Kultur. Die Schriften und Reden von Georg v. Below, Hermann Oncken und Gerhard Ritter im Ersten Weltkrieg\", in Wolfgang Mommsen, Elisabeth M\u00fcller-Luckner (eds.), Kultur und Krieg: Die Rolle der Intellektuellen, K\u00fcnstler und Schriftsteller im Ersten Weltkrieg (Schriften des Historischen Kollegs. Herausgegeben von der Stiftung Historisches Kolleg. Kolloquien 34), pp. 119, 136. Munich: R. Oldenbourg Verlag, 1996. ' promoted an increasingly radical right-wing platform, supporting militarists Alfred von Tirpitz and Erich Ludendorff while excoriating more moderate military and political elements. In 1916, Cossmann and his magazine defended Tirpitz's submarine war policy, submitting evidence that Tirpitz critic Veit Valentin had falsified military reports.Scheck, pp. 51\u201352 These were times of notoriety for the magazine: prior to the war, ' circulation stood at a few hundred copies,Alexandre, p. 96 rising to 3000-5000 ca. 1914, and increasing sharply after that, reaching 100,000 at times. October 1918 issue of the ' \"war book\" The journal hosted topical literature on war politics and alarming reports from the field, including Spahn's coverage of civilian defeatism in Alsace- Lorraine.Verhey, p. 95 In 1915, Eduard Meyer, Georg Kerschensteiner, and Ludwig Curtius published here their thoughts on the political and historical revelations of war, introducing theses about nationalist rivalry as the source of progress and European civilization.J\u00fcrgen von Ungern-Sternberg, \"Wie gibt man dem Sinnlosen einen Sinn? Zum Gebrauch der Begriffe 'deutsche Kultur' und 'Militarismus' im Herbst 1914\", in Wolfgang Mommsen, Elisabeth M\u00fcller-Luckner (eds.), Kultur und Krieg: Die Rolle der Intellektuellen, K\u00fcnstler und Schriftsteller im Ersten Weltkrieg (Schriften des Historischen Kollegs. Herausgegeben von der Stiftung Historisches Kolleg. Kolloquien 34), pp. 77\u201378, 83\u201385. Munich: R. Oldenbourg Verlag, 1996. Aiming to strengthen German propaganda in neutral Spain, the magazine hosted exposes depicting Iberian Federalism as a product of French intrigues, and homages to the conservative Mauristas.\u00c9tienne Martin Saint-L\u00e9on, \"M\u00e9langes et notices. La l\u00e9gende de Ferrer.

It included a piece by of the Jewish Centralverein, who urged for assimilation, the \"unwavering cultivation of German sentiments\".Christel Goldbach, Distanzierte Beobachtung: Theodor Wolff und das Judentum (Oldenburgische Beitr\u00e4ge zu J\u00fcdischen Studien Band 11), p. 38. Oldenburg: University of Oldenburg, 2002. Also featured were articles by Zionists Max Bodenheimer and Franz Oppenheimer, who purported that \"Eastern Jews\" were natural allies of German nationalism. More radical Jewish intellectuals, primarily Kurt Blumenfeld and , reacted against this juxtaposition, accusing Bodenheimer of having given up on Zionist ideals.Aschheim, pp. 163, 286\u2013287 Cossmann was also irritated by the \"uncritical\" views of Bodenheimer and his followers, which, he argued, were essentially \"platitudes\".Aschheim, pp. 170\u2013171 The editorship viewed the November 1918 Revolution and consequent fall of the monarchy as a disaster; its nationalist agitation was strengthened in the wake of the Munich Soviet Republic and the establishment of the Weimar Republic. In that context, its antisemitism also became more radical, integrating notions about \"Jewish Bolshevism\", and dropping ethical distinctions between assimilated and non-assimilated Jews,Aschheim, pp. 233, 300 although Cossmann remained rather critical of such analogies.Cahnman, p. 108 In February 1919, it became the first mainstream publication to host an article by M\u00fcller's brother-in-law Gottfried Feder. The self-taught economist and German Workers' Party ideologue explained his fight against \"interest slavery\", soon after developed into an explicitly antisemitic program.Albrecht Tyrel, \"Gottfried Feder and the NSDAP\", in Peter D. Stachura (ed.), The Shaping of the Nazi State, pp. 50\u201354. London: Croom Helm, 1978. At around the same time, the ' press put out a brochure by , a Jewish Russian refugee in Berlin. Its pessimistic prognosis was that world revolution had become an unstoppable \"torrent\".Ralf Georg Reuth, \"Woher kam Hitlers Judenhass?\", in Tobias Daniel Wabbel (ed.), Das Heilige Nichts. \u2013 Gott nach dem Holocaust, pp. 116, 268. D\u00fcsseldorf: Patmos Verlag, 2007. ==Versailles and \"stab-in-the- back\" claim== Circulation remained high in 1918\u20131920, before steadily declining over the subsequent decade. Cossmann found backing from powerful industrialists, aristocrats, and Bavarian People's Party (BVP) figures, who also sponsored him and his secretary Franz von Gebsattel to buy and publish the daily ', overbidding their Jewish competitors.Cahnman, pp. 107\u2013109. See also Struve, pp. 240\u2013241 This circle included Tirpitz, Prince of the secretive G\u00e4a-Club, Gustav von Kahr, Albert V\u00f6gler, and corporate backers from the Gute Hoffnungsh\u00fctte.Cahnman, pp. 107\u2013109; Scheck, pp. 89\u201391, 148 Although Kahr's ally, Cossmann did not support its regionalist platform, and was only interesting to Bavarian nationalists as an enemy of the Social Democratic Party (SPD).Cahnman, pp. 108\u2013109 He was sympathetic toward Karl Jarres of the mainstream German People's Party, trying to obtain him votes from the BVP.Scheck, p. 196 In December 1922, however, he and other ' men were involved in Tirpitz's conspiratorial project against Weimar, which discussed the creation of a German dictatorship under Kahr.Scheck, pp. 96, 98\u2013102. See also Struve, pp. 243\u2013245 From 1921, Cossmann's magazine took notice of the emerging Conservative Revolutionary movement, accepting its critique of V\u00f6lkisch traditionalism, and bringing in the radical sociologist as a contributor.Klemens von Klemperer, Germany's New Conservatism. Its History and Dilemma in the Twentieth Century, pp. 110\u2013111, 236. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1957. Ricarda Huch also contributed, in March 1923, with ' (\"War of Slogans\"), a national-anarchist satire of the League of Nations.Claudia Bruns, \"Ricarda Huch und die Konservative Revolution\", in WerkstattGeschichte, Vol. 25, 2000, p. 14 Another noted presence was philosopher Oswald Spengler, whose writings for ' talked about recapturing the \"spirit of 1914\", theorized as a voluntarist reshaping of power relations.Verhey, pp. 94\u201395 Spengler reassured Cossmann's readers that the Treaty of Versailles was a mere \"pause for breath\" in the otherwise unstoppable progress of Pan-Germanism.Struve, p. 251 The journal railed above all against Versailles' War Guilt Clause, campaigning for the return of German colonies, and publishing in 1924 Heinrich Schnee's highly popular tract, ' (\"The Lie of the Colonial Guilt\").Murphy, pp. 203\u2013205, 320 It also explored in depth the crisis of German nobility, with essays by aristocrats such as Dina Gusejnova, \"Noble Continent? German-speaking Nobles as Theorists of European Identity in the Interwar Period\", in Mark Hewitson, Matthew D'Auria (eds.), Europe in Crisis: Intellectuals and the European Idea, 1917\u20131957, pp. 121, 130. New York: Berghahn Books, 2012. and Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin. In his contribution, the latter also sketched out a plan for German settlement in the East.Stephan Malinowski, \"From King to F\u00fchrer: The German Aristocracy and the Nazi Movement\", in GHIL Bulletin, Vol. 27, Issue 1, 2005, p. 15 ' also became notorious by advocating for the stab-in-the-back myth, according to which Germany had not been truly defeated in 1918, but betrayed from within. The accusation, backed by the Spenglerian philosophical stance (defeat was a failure of national will),Verhey, p. 223 was notably taken up by Cossmann\u2014with a focus on the wartime Social Democrats. The M\u00fcnchener Post responded by criticizing Cossmann, and Cossmann sued the Post editor, Martin Gruber, for libel; it became a celebrity trial.Benjamin Ziemann, Contested Commemorations: Republican War Veterans and Weimar Political Culture, p. 202. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013. Cossmann won when Judge Hans Frank, himself a radical nationalist, ruled that he had acted in the public interest by publishing wartime letters attributed to SPD pacifist Felix Fechenbach.Cahnman, pp. 107\u2013108 ' helped instigate the political trial against Fechenbach.Scheck, p. 183 ==Late 1920s polemics== In its final decade, ' became \"mainstream\",Murphy, p. 18 a \"serious journal of the conservative bourgeoisie\", hosting contributions by right-wing assimilated Jews such as Leo Baeck, alongside antisemitic Germans like Theodor Fritsch, Ernst J\u00fcnger, and Count Reventlow.Bernd Weisbrod, \"Violence guerri\u00e8re et fondamentalisme masculin: Ernst J\u00fcnger\", Gen\u00e8ses, Vol. 33, 1998, pp. 121\u2013122 Like the BVP, it was ambiguous toward the nascent Nazi movement in the wake of the Nazis' Beer Hall Putsch. Spengler, who felt that Nazi adventurism had ruined his own budding project for an industrialist timocracy, broke with the Cossmann club, denouncing its failure to preclude the Putsch.Struve, pp. 244\u2013246 By 1927, the magazine again had a focus on eugenics, as well as racial hygiene and natalism. Hosting a topical essay by Spengler, it had contributions by eugenicists Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer, Alfred Ploetz, and Fritz Lenz.Liliane Crips, \"Du f\u00e9minisme comme d\u00e9cadence. Le discours sur les femmes des droites conservatrices et r\u00e9volutionnaires sous la R\u00e9publique de Weimar et le IIIe Reich\", L'Homme et la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, Vol. 99, 1991, p. 93 Issuing predictions about the \"fate of our race\", Lenz discussed the Nordic race in relation to the German people, while statistician Richard Korherr contributed Geburtenr\u00fcckgank (\"Birth Rate\"), a much-read study of the West's population decline.Andrea D'Onofrio, Razza, sangue e suolo. Utopie della razza e progetti eugenetici nel ruralismo nazista, pp. 12, 122. Naples: ClioPress, 2007. These works were complimented in 1929 by a essay on biopolitics and the alleged Slavic population pressure on Germany's eastern frontier, suggesting counteraction through German recolonization. In other ways the magazine contradicted V\u00f6lkisch tenets. Sexologist Max von Gruber wrote that most of the \"greatest men of our race\" were not purely Nordic, but \"hybrids\", and that productive miscegenation was in the national character.Rudolf Rocker, Nationalismus und Kultur, p. 309. M\u00fcnster: Bibliothek Th\u00e9l\u00e8me, 1999. Franz Spina's 1928 piece on the Sudeten Germans expressed support for a rapprochement between Germany and the Czechoslovak Republic.Johann Wolfgang Br\u00fcgel, Czechoslovakia before Munich. The German Minority Problem and British Appeasement Policy, p. 30. London: Cambridge University Press, 1973. Also, as noted by historian Bernd Weisbrod, 's racial antisemitism was of the moderate variety embraced by the National Populists. This was notably illustrated by its hosting, in September 1930, of an article by J\u00fcnger, in which the novelist suggested that self-segregation was \"the most efficient weapon\" against Jews. Returning to its critique of cultural imports at the height of the international Jazz Age, the magazine was focusing its attacks on modern American culture, and especially its African component.Michael H. Kater, \"The Impact of American Popular Culture on German Youth\", in Jonathan Huener, Francis R. Nicosia (eds.), The Arts in Nazi Germany: Continuity, Conformity, Change, pp. 35\u201336. New York: Berghahn Books, 2006. Korherr and took up Spenglerian themes about the \"inconsiderate\", \"nihilistic\", \"Americanized\" architecture of modern Berlin.Christian Sieg, \"Heimat Berlin. Siegfried Kracauer und Alfred D\u00f6blin als urbane Ethnografen der klassischen Moderne\", in Friederike Eigler, Jens Kugele (eds.), Heimat. At the Intersection of Memory and Space, pp. 94\u201395. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2012. J\u00fcnger's articles, however, showed leniency toward modernization and a more critical stance against V\u00f6lkisch tropes: he conceived of the \"German national revolution\" as an urban uprising, and decried peasant conservatism as outdated, \"doomed to failure\".Elliot Y. Neaman, A Dubious Past: Ernst J\u00fcnger and the Politics of Literature after Nazism, p. 44. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999. 0-520-21628-8 ' writers were also undecided about the import of physical education and the Weimar youth's emphasis on recreational sport: Ulrich von Wilamowitz deplored these developments, while Wilhelm Wien saw in them signs of recovery from \"the postwar chaos\".Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht, In 1926: Living on the Edge of Time, pp. 314, 318. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997. The popularity of German occultism and alternative medicine was examined by Cossmann's journal, over several issues. Astrologers such as were allowed to introduce their work to the magazine's middle-class readership, although their essays generally refrained from making astrological inferences.Treitel, pp. 133\u2013134, 306, 308 With articles by Sven Hedin and others, the magazine expressed skepticism against the fantastic travel accounts of F. Ossendowski, and against modern mysticism in general.Wim Coudenys, \"B\u00eates, hommes et dieux: les chim\u00e8res de F. Ossendowski pendant la r\u00e9volution\", in Eddy Stols, Werner Thomas, Johan Verberckmoes (eds.), Naturalia, mirabilia & monstrosa en los Imperios Ib\u00e9ricos: siglos XV-XIX, pp. 323\u2013327. Leuven: Leuven University Press, 2006. ==Nazi ascendancy to power== Shortly after the onset of the Great Depression, ' resumed campaigning for \"the revival of war generation\" and the fulfillment of its \"historical destiny\"\u2014themes central to the essays of Edgar Julius Jung, which saw print in Cossmann's magazine.Herbert F. Ziegler, Nazi Germany's New Aristocracy. The SS Leadership, 1925\u20131939, p. 67. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1989. In the late 1920s, Jung was outlining here his vision of neo-feudalism, communalism and grassroots democracy, as conservative resources against centralizing SPD governments.Struve, pp. 331, 337\u2013338 With monarchism on the decline, the journal still gave exposure to Wilhelm II's apologists, hosting 's 1929 study \"The Monarchy in German History\".Struve, p. 221 Some of the journal's contributors looked into new forms of authoritarianism. J\u00fcnger's 1930 text lambasted liberalism and Italian Fascism, noting that the latter only existed as a \"simplified and shortened\" version of the former. He envisaged a \"stricter solution\" to Germany's political and economic woes.Maurizio Bach, Stefan Breuer, Faschismus als Bewegung und Regime: Italien und Deutschland im Vergleich, p. 192. Wiesbaden: VS Verlag, 2010. The economic crisis brought in opportunities for corporatist and social credit schemes, which were taken up by , who proposed creating a national labor conscription service on such grounds. After a republican Voluntary Labor Service came into force in 1932, an article by celebrated its role in national pedagogy and social advancement.Wolfgang Benz, \"Vom freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst zur Arbeitsdienstpflicht\", in Vierteljahrshefte f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte, Vol. 16, Issue 4, 1968, pp. 320, 332 The journal's conservative position was at odds with Nazism, just as the latter was growing in popularity and numerical strength. Reventlow, who had since adhered to the Nazi Party, still frequented the ', where, in September 1930, he published a Nazi manifesto that called not just for \"complete separation\" from the Jews, but also for their \"annihilation\".Cahnman, p. 111 Cossmann himself rejected Nazi racial theory but, as sociologist Werner Jacob Cahnman has noted, his earlier work in propaganda had unwittingly given the Nazis \"a rousing slogan and terrific impetus\". According to Cahnman, Cossmann \"just did not wish to see the writing on the wall\". In early 1933, Cossmann and his collaborator , who had openly criticized Adolf Hitler in 1923, called for a monarchist coup against the nascent Nazi regime that would see Crown Prince Rupprecht placed on the throne. Setting out its platform, the magazine's January cover bore the title \"King Rupprecht\". The pair were arrested and imprisoned. Cossmann, described by scholar Steven E. Aschheim as \"a tragic victim of the breakdown of the German\u2013Jewish symbiosis\",Aschheim, p. 170 was sent to the ghetto of Berg am Laim in 1941, and died at Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1942. The magazine continued to run to 1936 under Nazi publisher , but became both insignificant and apolitical during this last phase. A late controversy came in October 1933, when Paul Wentzcke commemorated in his articles 1920s Rhenish separatism, depicting it as a popular self-help movement against Weimar incompetence.S. A. Schuker, \"Bayern und der rheinische Separatismus\", in Jahrbuch des Historischen Kollegs 1997, 1998, pp. 105\u2013106 Some of the final issues had encomiums of Nazi architecture, penned by art reviewers such as (who celebrated the Nuremberg Rally as a \"sacred space\").Steffen Kr\u00e4mer, \"Achsen f\u00fcr den Aufmarsch. Zur politischen Inszenierung des urbanen Raumes im Dritten Reich\", in Schriftenreihe der Winckelmann Akademie f\u00fcr Kunstgeschichte M\u00fcnchen Textbeitrag Nr. 18, February 2014, pp. 8, 16 Having already hosted comments by on holistic health in November 1932,Treitel, pp. 157, 312 other such issues had contributions by Nazified Neo-Adlerian therapists: Fritz K\u00fcnkel, who favored reintegrating patients within the \"greater community\"; and Harald Schultz-Hencke, who talked about a \"rediscovery of the soul\" by psychiatric science.Laurence A. Rickels, Nazi Psychoanalysis. Volume II, pp. 189\u2013190, 209. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2002.
