    "text": "Corrugated stainless steel tubing (CSST) is tubing made of stainless steel with corrugation on the inside or outside. CSST is not FAC (Flexible Appliance Connector) tubing. Presently, CSST and FAC tubing both use corrugated stainless steel tubing. In the past, FAC used corrugated brass tubing. However, FAC tubing is made only in lengths of 1 to 6 feet, FAC tubing is made with connectors on each end, and FAC tubing does not have a plastic sheath. On FAC tubing the corrugations are visible. CSST's plastic sheath covers its corrugations. ==Variants== One type is stainless steel tubing be formed with corrugated shape on outside surface. Make it higher efficiency of heat transfer, can be used to connect the form of tube soft and flexible, with good defensive displacement and vibration and noise reduction, mainly used on heat ex-changers. The other type is a type of conduit used for fuel gas distribution in buildings. It has a flexible corrugated stainless steel inner layer and an outer yellow or black plastic jacket. Yellow-jacketed CSST was developed first and is the most common. It has a non-conductive plastic yellow jacket. Black-jacketed CSST is relatively new. Its black jacket is electrically conductive. Manufacturer information indicates this conductive jacket dissipates the energy of indirect lightning strikes that might otherwise pierce or damage the yellow-jacketed CSST. ==Usage== CSST is used as an alternative to the older standard \u201cblack iron\u201d (steel) gas pipe. The inner stainless steel layer of typical residential CSST is .2 to .3 mm thick while the wall thickness of typical residential \u201cblack iron\u201d gas pipe is 3 to 4 mm thick. CSST is more expensive than \u201cblack iron\u201d gas pipe. However, CSST requires fewer joints, may be safer during earthquakes, and may be easier to install. ==Properties== CSST is alleged to have an increased risk for lightning related fires. Some believe that CSST is more likely to be pierced by lightning than \u201cblack iron\u201d pipe. There are varied opinions over CSST's fire risk and it has been involved in litigation. ==Installation== Buildings with CSST should be inspected by experts (licensed plumbers and electricians) to verify proper bonding and installation. The CSST experts should be qualified to assure compliance with the requirements of the manufacturer and local codes. Be aware that most home inspections are not done by licensed plumbers and electricians. Building owners are advised to assure that their CSST system complies with their insurance company's requirements. To reduce the possibility of CSST lightning damage: (1) Yellow-jacketed CSST should be bonded (connected to the electrical service panel's ground bus) at its entrance into a building. Many local codes require this. (2) All CSST should be installed away from metal objects such as metal duct work, metal pipes, electrical wiring, metal beams, or metal conduit. CSST should not make contact with sharp objects or edges to reduce the possibility of leaks caused by piercing. For example, it should not be installed where things such as picture hanger nails or drywall screws might pierce it. == References == * Corrugated Stainless Steel Tubing * National Association of State Fire Marshals * ecmweb.com * CSST settlement * Brennen Teal Foundation * CSST point of view * Texas CSST safety day Governor Rick Perry * CSST Safety * NFPA Category:Corrugation Category:Stainless steel Category:Tubing (material) ",
