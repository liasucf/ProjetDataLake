    "text": "WRVL is a Contemporary Christian formatted broadcast radio station licensed to Lynchburg, Virginia, serving the New River Valley. WRVL is owned and operated by Liberty University. ==History== WRVL went on the air in July 1981 and faced a series of technical problems in its early years revolving around interference to television reception near the station site. In December 1981, the Federal Communications Commission ordered the station to reduce effective radiated power from 100,000 to 5,000 watts. In 1982, its radio tower was brought down by vandals; while the station was silent, viewers reported better reception of WDBJ (channel 7). In 2009, WRVL broke ground by forming a partnership with NPR broadcaster WVTF in Roanoke, Virginia, allowing them to repeat Victory FM programming on WVTW's HD-3 channel in Charlottesville, Virginia. This is noteworthy because it makes WVTW perhaps one of few HD radio stations in the nation funded by the federal Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP).1n grant year 2007 the PTFP funded a project to increase the power of WVTW, to extend its signal coverage to about 193,000 additional persons. On December 26, 2014, WRVL dropped all religious teaching programming for a Contemporary Christian format. The station's name also changed from \"Victory Radio Network\" to \"The Journey\". ==Simulcasts== \"The Journey\" is carried on several stations in Virginia and North Carolina. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
