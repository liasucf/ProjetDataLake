    "text": "Damian Spinelli is a fictional character on the ABC daytime drama, General Hospital, played by actor Bradford Anderson from November 13, 2006, to December 16, 2013. Spinelli was also one of the characters in the first season of General Hospital: Night Shift, which premiered on July 12, 2007. On May 6, 2014, it was announced that Bradford Anderson would be returning to play Spinelli. He returned on May 20, 2014. He later returned once more in late 2014 and again on February 13, 2015. Spinelli returned on October 15, 2015. ==Casting and characterization== In September 2006, General Hospital put out a casting call for a \"college-aged kid\" who was a cross between Seth Green and Spicoli, a character played by Sean Penn in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. The part was won by Anderson, who says he tries to emulate Spicoli's speaking style when playing the character. Spinelli's dialogue, a rapid-fire mix of surfer lingo and Internet slang, has offered comic relief, and an unusual \"tech-savvy\" character to the show. ABC Soaps in Depth called Spinelli \"one of the quirkiest characters daytime has ever seen,\"Kelli M. Larson, \"A different kind of hero\", ABC Soaps in Depth, May 22, 2007 while Michael Fairman stated, \"Spinelli rates high as one of soaps most recognizable characters, something it has taken other actors and their alter-egos years to pull off.\" Speaking on Anderson's performance and subsequent inspiration behind its spinoff book, costar Carolyn Hennesy said to Entertainment Weekly, \"His mind is so fantastical. When Spinelli is Spinelli, the Spinelli-speak is very difficult to wade through, which is why I think [actor] Bradford Anderson is deserving of something higher than an Emmy. How he has managed that dialogue is genius to me.\" Anderson says he generally doesn't improvise the part, instead sticking to the script supplied a couple days before filming. The name of the specific writer or writers who create Spinelli's dialogue have not been identified. After indulging his fans in some of his first appearances, Anderson no longer \"speaks Spinelli\" outside the show. He commented to Soap Opera Digest, \"Spinelli does not make public appearances; Bradford does. I leave him at work, and that's more than okay for me.\" Anderson initially played the character on a recurring status, but the character proved popular, and actor Bradford Anderson was offered a multi-year contract, which he accepted in May 2007. The character was added to the opening credits sequence on July 6, 2007. Anderson received Daytime Emmy nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor in 2009, 2010, and 2012, as well as a pre-nomination in 2008. Anderson also pulled double duty as Spinelli was one of the crossover characters that appeared in the Summer 2007 season of General Hospital: Night Shift. Spinelli is known for using nicknames for a variety of characters, all of which are derived from one of their perceived attributes; for example, he has dubbed Jason \"Stone Cold\" for his taciturn and unemotional personality. On May 24, 2013, Anderson confirmed on Twitter that he had decided not to renew his contract, but would remain with the series on a recurring basis. In late 2013, it was confirmed that Anderson would exit the series, alongside co-star Emily Wilson. Anderson returned to the series on a recurring basis. In December 2016, it was announced that Blake Berris had been temporarily cast in the role, due to Anderson being unavailable, due to a \"scheduling conflict\". ==Storylines== ===2006\u20132009=== Damian Spinelli is introduced as Lorenzo Alcazar's computer hacker responsible for creating falsified evidence against Sam McCall.
