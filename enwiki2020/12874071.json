It was owned by the Pikes Peak Broadcasting Company and was Colorado Springs' second radio station (after KVOR).Broadcasting Yearbook 1948 page 96 The call sign has always been KRDO, referring to KoloRaDO, with a \"K\" substituting for the \"C.\" The station was originally powered at 250 watts. In 1953, KRDO put a TV station on the air, Channel 13 KRDO-TV, as Colorado Springs' NBC TV Network affiliate.Telecasting Yearbook 1953 page 73 (The TV station today is an ABC TV affiliate.) By the late 1960s, KRDO got a daytime power boost to 1,000 watts. But it still had to reduce power at night to 250 watts. In 1969, an FM station was put on the air, 95.1 KRDO-FM, a beautiful music outlet. In 1975, KRDO joined NBC's News and Information Service to become an all-news radio station.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-32 When that service was discontinued in 1977, KRDO switched to a middle of the road format of popular music and news, as an affiliate of the Mutual Broadcasting System.Broadcasting Yearbook 1979 page C-33 and later the RKO Radio Network. By the mid-1980s, the older songs were dropped and the station moved to a full service adult contemporary music format while returning to Mutual Broadcasting and clearing Larry King's evening talk program. In 1985, the FCC allowed KRDO to remain powered at 1,000 watts, both day and night.Broadcasting Yearbook 1986 page B-44 In late 1987, KRDO switched to an oldies sound. In 1991, the station flipped to a country music format.Broadcasting Yearbook 1993 page B-56 By the mid 1990s, the station was broadcasting an all sports format. During most of its run as a Sports Radio stations KRDO carried One On One Sports (later known as Sporting News Radio and today is known as SB Nation Radio). In June 2006, KRDO-AM-TV were sold to the News-Press & Gazette company, while KRDO-FM went to Citadel Broadcasting, switching call letters to KATC-FM as a country music outlet. The Hoth Family, as Pikes Peak Broadcasting, had owned KRDO from its founding in 1947 until 2006, nearly six decades. The new owners coupled 1240 KRDO with FM 105.5, changing the FM call sign to KRDO-FM and having both radio stations simulcast a news-talk format drawing on the news department resources of KRDO-TV 13. ==References== ==External links== * Radio Homepage-KRDO.com *FCC History Cards for KRDO RDO Category:News-Press & Gazette Company Category:Radio stations established in 1947 Category:1947 establishments in Colorado Category:Denver Broncos broadcasters ",
