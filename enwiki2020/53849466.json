Her father was an Army captain and he died when she was a small child. She attended a boarding school from the age of eleven to seventeen where she was a prize winning student. When she returned home she found that her family were destitute. She failed to find work befitting her ambitions and it was only religion that gave her hope. Sokhanskaia was still reading and she wrote short stories that she submitted. She sent copies to the literary critic Pyotr Pletnyov who had edited the journal The Contemporary. He advised her to write about her own life. This improved her style and during the 1850s she published many stories about local life. These stories were set in the area where she lived in Ukraine that included the local culture and its history.Sokhanskaia, Nadezhda (1823\u20131884), \"Sokhanskaia, Nadezhda (1823\u20131884)\", Dictionary of Women Worldwide: 25,000 Women Through the Ages She continued to write throughout her life and her Autobiography was published in 1896 after her death in Kharkov Governorate in 1884. ==References== Category:1823 births Category:1884 deaths Category:People from Kursk Governorate Category:19th-century Russian writers Category:19th-century Russian women writers Category:19th-century Russian short story writers Category:Russian autobiographers Category:Women autobiographers ",
