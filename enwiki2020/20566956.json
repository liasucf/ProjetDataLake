Ha-Kol (Glasilo \u017didovske zajednice u Hrvatskoj); Aleksander Laslo, Nata\u0161a Maksimovi\u0107 Suba\u0161i\u0107; Graditelji novog Zagreba; stranica 21; broj 108, sije\u010danj / velja\u010da 2009. ==Biography== Jacobi was born in Jacobshagen, Kingdom of Prussia (now Poland), the son of the merchant Mayer Jacobi and his wife Sara-Miriam (n\u00e9e Goldberg). His father died when he was ten years old, and his maternal grandfather Rabbi Jacob Moses Goldberg and uncle Rabbi Nachman Abraham Goldberg were his religious instructors. He attended the K\u00f6lnische Gymnasium school in Berlin. A member of the Modern Orthodox Jewish congregation in Berlin, Jacobi was a student of Rabbi Azriel Hildesheimer and Rabbi Elchanan Rosenstein who ordained him. He studied Semitic languages, Hebrew and Theology, in the universities of Berlin and Halle, Saxony-Anhalt (Ph.D. 1865, his dissertation being \"De loco feminarum apud Iudaeos antiuissimos maxime matrimonii contrahendi ratione habita\" \u2013 \"The Role of Women in Judaism\"). Jacobi married Hulda Pander and had seven children. In 1867 he became Chief Rabbi of Zagreb, Croatia. Jacobi established and headed, in Zagreb, the Jewish elementary school (Talmud Torah), taught Jewish Studies in high-schools, taught Hebrew and Judaism and established Jewish-Women organizations. He was also active in social welfare projects for the Jewish and General Population in Yugoslavia, for which he was highly respected by the general population and the leaders of other religious denominations. In 1885 Jacobi delivered the first Synagogue-Sermon in the Croat language thus encouraging the integration of Jews into the general population; he also wrote the first ever Jewish- Studies text-books in Croatian. Jacobi's children: his son Dr. Ivan (Hans, Johanan), his daughters Luise Zaloscer and Klara (Loja) Barmaper and his son in law Dr. Hugo Spitzer were among the prominent leaders of the Jewish community and Zionist Movement in Croatia. Jacobi died in Zagreb and was buried at the Mirogoj Cemetery. Gradska groblja Zagreb: Hosca Jacobi, Mirogoj \u017d-2-I-16 ==Writings== * Ueber die Stellung des Weibes im Judenthum.
