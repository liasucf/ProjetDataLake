In 1978, Mabie resigned from his seat as mayor of Pine Beach, a position that paid $500 a year, and retained a $6,000 post on the Ocean County, New Jersey Board of Elections; state laws prohibiting double dipping required Mabie to give up one of the positions.Sullivan, Joseph F. \"Shoot\u2010out: Bradley vs. Leone\", The New York Times, April 23, 1978. Accessed April 21, 2017. \"Benjamin H. Mabie, the Ocean County Republican Chairman, ... has served as a municipal tax collector, Councilman, Mayor and State Assemblyman. However, Mr. Mabie resigned as Mayor of Pine Beach last week because he wanted to keep his seat on the county's Board of Elections. His dual officeholding had finally run afoul of a state law that prevents one from holding both elective and appointive offices. Mr. Mabie said the fact that the Election Board job paid $6,000 annually and the Mayor's post (which he turned back to the borough) only $500 helped him decide which job to keep.\" ==References== Category:20th-century American politicians Category:Members of the New Jersey General Assembly Category:New Jersey Republicans Category:Mayors of places in New Jersey Category:People from Pine Beach, New Jersey ",
