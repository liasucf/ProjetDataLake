It has more than 39 locations in the state, as well as an online store. What is now Smithfield's Chicken 'N Bar-B-Q was opened by Junius and Maggie Moore in downtown Smithfield, North Carolina in 1977 as Smithfield Bar-B-Q, soon followed by a second restaurant in nearby Clayton, NC.. The business expanded in 1979 to Salter Path. Starting in the early 1980s, the company opened additional restaurants in eastern North Carolina, and expanded to the Raleigh-Durham area in the 1990s. ==Controversy== In April 2017, the Raleigh Police Protective Association accused employees and managers of the Smithfield's location in Garner, North Carolina of singing \"Fuck tha Police\" while officers dined there. After an investigation by the Raleigh PD and Smithfield's, it was determined the event happened differently than posted by the RPPA. The owners of the franchise location subsequently apologized and stated that they would terminate any employees involved. ==See also== * List of chicken restaurants ==References== Category:Companies based in North Carolina Category:Fast-food chains of the United States Category:Fast-food franchises Category:Restaurants established in 1964 Category:Barbecue restaurants Category:Regional restaurant chains in the United States Category:Poultry restaurants ",
