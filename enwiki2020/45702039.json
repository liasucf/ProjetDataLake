They had wheel arrangement C, with three axles powered through a jackshaft. Six units of the type were built, of which three were bought by the Danish State Railways (DSB) and designated Class MH, numbered 201\u2013203. These formed the basis for the 120 locomotives MH 301\u2013420, built by Danish company Frichs without licence from Henschel. The other three units were purchased by different German industrial railways. == References == * * == External links == * Henschel - DH 440 at rangierdiesel.de * DSB Litra MH at jernbanen.dk MH 201\u2013203 DH 440 Category:C locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1956 Category:Diesel locomotives of Denmark Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Denmark Category:Diesel-hydraulic locomotives of Germany Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Germany ",
