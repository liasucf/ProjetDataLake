    "text": "Alberto \"Berto\" Cayarga Fern\u00e1ndez (born 17 September 1996) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a winger for FC Cartagena. ==Club career== Born in Avil\u00e9s, Asturias, Cayarga joined Sporting de Gij\u00f3n's youth setup in 2014, after already making his senior debut with SD Llano 2000. In July 2015, after finishing his formation, he was loaned to Tercera Divisi\u00f3n side UP Langreo for one year. Upon returning, Cayarga agreed to a two-year contract and was assigned to the reserves, now also in the fourth tier. He helped the B-team in their promotion in his first season, and scored a career- best nine goals in his second, as his side missed out a second consecutive promotion in the play-offs. On 7 August 2018, Cayarga signed a two-year deal with Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B side Racing de Santander. He was a first-choice for the Cantabrian side, which achieved promotion to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Cayarga made his professional debut on 17 August 2019, starting in a 0\u20131 home loss against M\u00e1laga CF. The following 31 January, he terminated his contract with Racing, and signed a six-month deal with third division side FC Cartagena, with option for a further year, just hours later. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:People from Avil\u00e9s Category:Spanish footballers Category:Asturian footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:Tercera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Divisiones Regionales de F\u00fatbol players Category:Sporting de Gij\u00f3n B players Category:UP Langreo footballers Category:Racing de Santander players Category:FC Cartagena footballers ",
