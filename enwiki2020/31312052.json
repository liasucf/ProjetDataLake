Dutton) and his friend Lymon (Courtney B. Vance) travel from Mississippi to Pittsburgh, where he wishes his sister Berniece (Alfre Woodard) to give him the family's heirloom piano so that he can sell it to buy land from Mr. Sutter (Tim Hartman), a descendant of the family that once owned Willie's own ancestors as slaves. The piano itself had at one time belonged to the wife of the original Sutter, the white former owner of their family... and decades earlier, Berniece and Boy Willie's grandfather had, at the slave master's instructions, carved the black family's African tribal history and American slave history into the piano's surface. When Boy Willie arrives, his Uncle Doaker (Carl Gordon) tells Willie that Berniece won't part with the piano. Berniece's boyfriend Avery (Tommy Hollis) and her Uncle Wining Boy (Lou Myers) also attempt for reasons of their own to get Berniece to sell. As selling the piano would be like turning her back on their people and their past, Berniece continues to refuse. ==Cast== * Charles S.

They noted that Wilson has been long known for \"profound, deeply moving portraits of African Americans in the United States,\" and that he \"understands the issues facing minorities better than most modern playwrights do.\" They called the film a \"brilliant analog,\" and a \"fable of magic realism.\" TV Guide wrote that the film is \"a wrenching but flawed cable adaptation of August Wilson's play,\" and that while the film was another Wilson \"folk tale about the legacy of slavery,\" that \"Sadly, this particular production fails to make any psychological or ectoplasmic ghosts come alive for the audience.\" They noted this was not because the film did not make the playwright's message clear, the problem was in \"its obviousness\" in that Wilson belabored his points. ===Awards and nominations=== * 1996, Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Made for Television Movie * 1995, Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Costume Design for a Miniseries or a Special * 1995, Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Costume Design for a Miniseries or a Special * 1995, Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Directing for a Miniseries or a Special * 1995, Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Editing for a Miniseries or a Special \u2013 Single Camera Production * 1995, Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Sound Mixing for a Drama Miniseries or a Special * 1995, Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Writing for a Miniseries or a Special * 1995, Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Special * 1995, Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Special * 1996, Won Cinema Audio Society Award for Outstanding Achievement in Sound Mixing for a Movie of the Week, Mini-Series or Special * 1996, Won Peabody Award * 1996, Won Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a TV Movie or Miniseries * 1996, Won Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Television Movie, Mini-Series * 1996, Image Award nomination for Outstanding Actor in a Television Movie, Mini-Series * 1996, Image Award nomination for Outstanding Television Movie or Mini-Series * 1996, Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV ==References== ==External links== * Category:1995 television films Category:1995 films Category:American films Category:Films directed by Lloyd Richards Category:Films scored by Stephen James Taylor Category:Films set in Pittsburgh Category:Hallmark Hall of Fame episodes Category:Peabody Award- winning broadcasts ",
