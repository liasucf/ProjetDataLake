    "text": "Plot of Mariner 10 flyby of planet Venus in February 1974. A planetary flyby is the act of sending a space probe past a planet or a dwarf planet close enough to record scientific data. This is a subset of the overall concept of a flyby in spaceflight. The first flyby of another planet with a functioning spacecraft took place on December 14, 1962, when Mariner 2 zoomed by the planet Venus. Planetary flybys are commonly used as gravity assist maneuvers to \"slingshot\" a space probe toward its primary target without expending fuel, but in some cases (such as with New Horizons), flybys are the primary objectives of a mission in of themselves. A relatively recent example of a flyby spacecraft is New Horizons, which performed flyby maneuvers of Jupiter, Pluto and its moons in the 21st century. The flyby of Jupiter, used as a gravity assist, allowed the craft to reach Pluto at high velocity without the complications of slowing down, after which it proceeded further into the Kuiper Belt on an escape trajectory out of the Solar System. ==List of planetary flybys== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin: 1ex auto 1ex auto\" |- ! class=\"sortable\" | Flyby date ! class=\"sortable\" | Launch date ! class=\"sortable\" | Operator ! class=\"sortable\" | Spacecraft ! class=\"unsortable\" | Details ! class=\"unsortable\" | Mission result |- style=\"background:#fbb;\" | 19 May 1961 | 12 February 1961 | | Venera 1 | First Venus flyby (contact lost before flyby) | Failure |- style=\"background:#cfc;\" | 14 December 1962 | 27 August 1962 | | Mariner 2 | First successful non-lunar planetary encounter and first successful Venus flyby | Success |- style=\"background:#fbb;\" | 19 June 1963 | 1 November 1962 | | Mars 1 | First Mars flyby (contact lost) | Failure |- style=\"background:#fbb;\" | 19 July 1964 | 2 April 1964 | | Zond 1 | Venus flyby (contact lost) | Failure |- style=\"background:#cfc;\" | 15 July 1965 | 28 November 1964 | | Mariner 4 | First successful Mars flyby | Success |- style=\"background:#fbb;\" | 6 August 1965 | 30 November 1964 | | Zond 2 | Mars flyby (contact lost) | Failure |- style=\"background:#fbb;\" | 27 February 1966 | 12 November 1965 | | Venera 2 | Venus flyby (contact lost) | Failure |- style=\"background:#cfc;\" | 19 October 1967 | 14 June 1967 | | Mariner 5 | Venus flyby | Success |- style=\"background:#cfc;\" | 31 July 1969 | 25 February 1969 | | Mariner 6 | Mars flyby | Success |- style=\"background:#cfc;\" | 5 August 1969 | 27 March 1969 | | Mariner 7 | Mars flyby | Success |- style=\"background:#cfc;\" | 3 December 1973 | 3 March 1972 | | Pioneer 10 | First Jupiter flyby | Success |- style=\"background:#cfc;\" | 5 February 1974 | 4 November 1973 | | Mariner 10 | Venus flyby | Success |- style=\"background:#fbb;\" | 10 February 1974 | 21 July 1973 | | Mars 4 | Mars flyby (inadvertent;
