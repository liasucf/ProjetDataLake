    "text": "Harish Raut (7 November 1925 - 2002 ) was an Indian artist who developed a distinctive figurative style. Idealized rural women, going about their daily chores was the main subject of his work. His early work was based on the rural realities of his hometown Bordi and the neighbouring town of Bassein, Maharashtra. Rural India continued to inspire him and he found his muse once again in the women of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala. Raut graduated with a diploma in painting from the J.J School Fine Art in Mumbai in 1952. For many of his early years he worked as a clerk but continued to paint developing a strong personal signature style. In less than a decade his work was winning awards all over India. Over the course of his long career he had 53 one man shows in Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi, Washington, D.C., New York City, and Ottawa. ==References== * Artists Directory, Covering Painters, Sculptors and Engravers - Lalit Kala Akademi (1961), * Bombay Art Society's Art Journal (1962), * A History of Indian Painting: The Modern Period by Krishna Chaitanya ==External links== * Official Website Category:Indian male painters Category:1925 births Category:2002 deaths Category:20th-century Indian painters Category:People from Thane district Category:Painters from Maharashtra ",
