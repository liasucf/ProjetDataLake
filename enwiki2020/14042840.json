During his youth, Axel joined a shipping company. Later he became an owner and captain in the inland (lake) shipping business. In 1865, Axel used a loan to purchase a wooden trading ketch, Mathilda. This would lead to the founding of the Swedish shipping company Brostr\u00f6m Lines. His son, Dan Brostr\u00f6m, was the Swedish Naval Minister from 1914 to 1917. His grandson, Tor Erland Brostr\u00f6m, was board chairman of Swedish American Line. == References == Category:1838 births Category:1905 deaths Category:People from Kristinehamn Category:People from Kristinehamn Municipality Category:19th-century Swedish businesspeople Category:Swedish businesspeople in shipping ",
