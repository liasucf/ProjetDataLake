    "text": "Oluseyi Ashaolu (born April 18, 1988) is a Nigerian-Canadian basketball player who last played for the NLEX Road Warriors of the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA). A 6' 7\" power forward, Ashaolu played college basketball at Louisiana Tech and Oregon. ==College career== Ashaolu lived in Brampton until 2004, when he made the move to Atlanta for grade 9, to play high school basketball stateside.

He earned his bachelor's degree in business administration in 2011 and decided he did not want to be part of the rebuilding effort under rookie head coach Michael White. On May 24, 2011, Ashaolu announced his transfer to Oregon, choosing the Ducks over Texas, San Diego State and Xavier. Ashaolu took advantage of the graduate transfer rule and did not have to sit out the season as a redshirt. One of the reasons he joined Oregon was because his AAU teammate, Devoe Joseph, was on the squad. Ashaolu was relegated to a bench role as a senior, but did not mind the decreased minutes. He averaged 9.2 points and 5.2 rebounds per game in his only season at Oregon. ==Professional career== Following the close of his college career, Ashaolu was not drafted in the 2012 NBA draft.

Ashaolu averaged 18.5 points and 7.6 rebounds per game but was hampered by a knee injury in November 2017. ===First Stint with the NLEX Road Warriors=== He signed with the NLEX Road Warriors of the Philippine Basketball Association in June 2018.
