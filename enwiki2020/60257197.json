    "text": "Rivermeade is a housing development within the St. Margaret's area of Fingal, in the traditional County Dublin, Ireland. ==Rivermeade today== The Rivermeade Estate comprises 175 homes over five streets, just to the south of the Ward River. It is served by the Rivermeade Park stop of the Dublin Bus 40B route, the terminus. The housing was at least partly originally built to house people displaced in the expansion of Dublin Airport. The population fell from 660 in 1991 to 530 in 2016. Rivermeade is served by a national school, and a Roman Catholic church, and is home to Athletic Union League soccer team Rivermeade F.C. ==Plans for development== In 2018, the local authority, Fingal County Council, published a statutory Local Area Plan (LAP), a previous plan from 2013 to expand the estate not having come to fruition. This plan envisages making Rivermeade and St. Margaret's in general a more viable community and providing a base for local services, with allowance for the addition of up to 275 houses, and a first commercial centre for the estate, and a civic space. ==References== Category:Places in Fingal ",
