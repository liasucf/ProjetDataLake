Written by Talay Riley, Sean Douglas, Nick Seeley, Robert Bergin and its producers Guetta, Garrix, Brooks and Giorgio Tuinfort, it was released on 22 February 2018 by What a Music, as the second single from Guetta's seventh studio album, 7 (2018). ==Background== Guetta said of the song: \"When we hit the studio we were already working on several tracks. After we saw the great response on 'So Far Away' we thought f*** it, we will release another track together straight away.\" Garrix added: \"David is a legend. I have a lot of respect for him as an artist and I'm very happy we were able to release another track together with the amazing Brooks who I have worked with on other records before. I think he's one of the most talented producers out there.\" ==Release and promotion== Garrix originally premiered the song during his TimeOut72 Festival set in Goa, India. On 14 February 2018, Guetta and Brooks released a teaser of the song on social media, revealing its release date. A remix contest for the song was held in association with the app Soonvibes, winners were selected as part of the official remixes. ==Composition== \"Like I Do\" is a big room house track, with vocals provided by Talay Riley. It blends elements from future bounce and pop with \"heavy bass and a dancefloor-ready beat\". On the opening lines, the voice rises \"over shimmering synths and a fizzing production\", before building up into \"an earworm-worthy chorus\". According to Billboards Kat Bein, the song is \"a stomping mix of horns and bass that's funky\". ==Critical reception== In a positive review, a Your EDM contributor regarded the song as \"a wonderfully melodic new release that's a surefire radio hit with an EDM-friendly drop that Garrix and Brooks fans will both appreciate\". Mike Nied of Idolator called the collaboration \"refreshing\", deeming the song \"a blending of all their respective sounds\". ==Track listing== * Digital download # \"Like I Do\" \u2013 3:22 * Digital download \u2013 remixes # \"Like I Do\" (Dasko & Agrero remix) \u2013 2:58 # \"Like I Do\" (Upsilone remix) \u2013 2:50 # \"Like I Do\" (Jumpexx remix) \u2013 4:07 # \"Like I Do\" (Foxa and Conor Ross remix) \u2013 3:43 # \"Like I Do\" (Edson Faiolli remix) \u2013 5:10 ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from Tidal. * David Guetta \u2013 composition, production, programming * Martin Garrix \u2013 composition, production, programming * Brooks \u2013 composition, production, master engineering, mixing, programming * Talay Riley \u2013 composition, background vocals * Giorgio Tuinfort \u2013 composition, production, programming * Sean Douglas \u2013 composition * Nick Seeley \u2013 composition, keyboard * Robert Bergin \u2013 composition * The Pianoman \u2013 talk box ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA) | 73 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Poland (Video Chart) | 4 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Denmark (Tracklisten) | 94 |- ! scope=\"row\"| France (SNEP) | 134 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Hungary (Dance Top 40) | 61 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) | 83 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Netherlands (Single Top 100) | 79 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) | 55 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot Dance/Electronic Songs (Billboard) | 33 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal (AFP) | 1356 |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Version ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Various | 22 February 2018 | rowspan=\"2\"| Digital download | Original | rowspan=\"2\"| What a Music | |- | 8 June 2018 | Remixes | |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2018 songs Category:2018 singles Category:David Guetta songs Category:Martin Garrix songs Category:Songs written by David Guetta Category:Songs written by Martin Garrix Category:Songs written by Talay Riley Category:Songs written by Giorgio Tuinfort Category:Songs written by Sean Douglas (songwriter) Category:Stmpd Rcrds singles Category:Song recordings produced by David Guetta ",
