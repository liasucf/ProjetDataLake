    "text": "Many Christians choose to practice teetotalism during Lent, thus giving up alcoholic beverages during the liturgical season. The Lenten sacrifice refers to a pleasure or luxury that Christians (especially Anglicans, Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists, Moravians and the Reformed) give up for the liturgical season of Lent, which starts on Ash Wednesday annually. The tradition of the Lenten sacrifice has its roots in Jesus fasting for forty days in the Jud\u00e6n desert. When Lent is over and Easter Sunday arrives, the faithful are able to indulge in what they sacrificed during the Lenten season. Common Lenten sacrifices include giving up chocolate, soft drinks, and sweets. Some Christians choose to practice temperance throughout the Lenten season, thus giving up alcoholic beverages; in light of this, temperance drinks experience a surge of popularity during the Lenten season. Others, on the first day of Lent, pledge to give up sinful behaviours, such as swearing, and hope to permanently rid themselves of these habits even after the arrival of Eastertide. While making a Lenten sacrifice, it is customary for Christians to pray for strength to keep it; many often wish others for doing so as well, e.g. \"May God bless your Lenten sacrifice.\" Many Christians sacrifice the eating of meat and commit to Christian vegetarianism for the entire Lenten season. It is commonplace for Anglican, Methodist, and Roman Catholic Christians to observe the Friday Fast throughout Lent, which includes abstaining from meat on the Fridays of Lent. Christian clergy, both Roman Catholic and Methodist, have encouraged the faithful not to give up social media for Lent as they believe that Christians can use social media for evangelism. In addition to making their Lenten sacrifice, many Christians choose to add a Lenten spiritual discipline, such as reading a daily devotional or praying through a Lenten calendar, to draw themselves nearer to God. == See also == *Black Fast *Christian Vegetarian Association *Pioneer Total Abstinence Association == References == == External links == *Could you go alcohol-free for Lent? - The United Methodist Church *Veg for Lent - Christian Vegetarian Association *Some Christians Give Up Alcohol for Lent - The Christian Post *Lenten Devotions - Lutheran Hour Ministries *After Giving up Alcohol, I\u2019m Addicted to Lent - Sojourners *102 Things You Should Really Give Up For Lent - Life Teen Category:Christian behaviour and experience Category:Christian fasting Category:Lent ",
