    "text": "Zlatko \u0160ulenti\u0107 (1893\u20131971) was a Croatian painter of landscapes and portraits. He was one of the second generation of Croatian modern painters, a follower of the Munich Circle painters. He also studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, and began to develop his own version of expressionism and cubism in Croatia, with refined colour harmonies. In his later work \u0160ulenti\u0107 painted religious motifs, landscapes and city views, but he remained foremost a portrait painter. He taught drawing in school and at the Academy of Fine Arts, Zagreb. He travelled extensively, and published a book \"People, Places, Infinity\" (Ljudi, krajevi, beskraj). == Biography == Zlatko \u0160ulenti\u0107 was born 16 March 1893 in Glina. When he was three years old, his mother died. In later years he would tell his wife that she lived in his memory \"like a shadow sitting with him on the couch.\" He attended high-school at Karlovac, then in 1910 took classes given by Robert Auer at the Provisional School for Arts and Crafts in Zagreb. His training continued in Munich, firstly private lessons with Heinrich Knirr, then at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich (1911\u20131914). While still a student, in 1913 he visited Paris. \u0160ulenti\u0107 exhibited for the first time at the inaugural Zagreb Spring Salon of 1916, when he was one of the organizers. During the period 1921-1927 he exhibited with the Independent Group of Artists (Grupa nezavisnih umjetnika) whose other members were Ljubo Babi\u0107, Vladimir Beci\u0107, Jozo Kljakovi\u0107, Frano Kr\u0161ini\u0107, Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107, Jerolim Mi\u0161e, Marin Studin and Vladimir Varlaj. He also held solo exhibits in Gallery Ulrich in 1921, 1927, and 1941. From an early age, he travelled extensively, initially in the company of his father, a physician. He travelled within Croatia: around Glina and Karlovac, Zagreb, Japeti\u0107, Ple\u0161ivica and the Adriatic coast, and later \u0160ulenti\u0107 would visit most European countries, across North Africa, North America, South America, Burma, Indonesia, Malaysia and Egypt. Impressions from these trips were recorded in sketches and watercolors, with a series of notes which were later published in his book \"People, Places, Infinity\" (1971). \u0160ulenti\u0107 taught life drawing in school, and later became a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts, Zagreb. In 1947, due to the politics of the time, his position at the Academy was terminated. At the age of 54, he found himself retired on a small pension at a time when there was limited opportunity to exhibit and earn a living from art. \u0160ulenti\u0107 devoted his time to painting, and in 1953 resumed his travels. By 1959, he began to receive recognition for his work in major Croatian exhibitions. In 1961 he was decorated with the Order of the Republic. The Rijeka Museum of Modern Art held an exhibition marking his 70th anniversary, and other galleries followed: Zorin Dom, Karlovac, Strossmayer Galleries in Zagreb, Art Salon in Osijek, Gallery of Fine Arts in Split, and Matica hrvatska. From 1964-1968 \u0160ulenti\u0107 worked for the Franciscan monastery at Ksaver in Zagreb. His picture of the \"Sermon on the Mount\" (Propovijedi na gori) includes his last self-portrait. In 1969 he received the Vladimir Nazor Award for lifetime achievement in the visual arts. Zlatko \u0160ulenti\u0107 died in Zagreb on 9 July 1971. == Legacy == \u0160ulenti\u0107 is one of the best-known Croatian expressionists. A crucial early influence was the paintings of Miroslav Kraljevi\u0107 and the modern art movement. Public appreciation of his own paintings dates from 1916, the first Spring Salon in Zagreb. His pictures featured the lively colour and expressionism so often present in his later work. He strove for spiritual content in his painting, saying that he wanted to know what was behind the reality. Throughout his artistic career, landscapes, still lifes, portraits, and religious compositions bore his personal artistic signature of graded tones and colours with free line-work. This was evident in his gouaches, watercolors, oils, and drawings. In 1930 on a trip to Paris, he painted one of his best pictures \"Place de Tertre\", using a limited colour palette, and creating a modern sense of space. In the 1950s and 1960s he painted his summer travel series (Zadar, Vrbnik, Kvarner, \u0160ipan). The use of expressive colour tending towards abstractionism put him among the ranks of the best contemporary Croatian artists. \u0160ulenti\u0107 was an important figure of the second generation of Croatian Modernism, the creator of a series of iconic works in his own signature style. He was also a contemporary artist. At the end of the sixties he was a master of expressive colour and portrayed in-depth content in human, painterly gestures. A major retrospective of his work was held at the Modern Gallery, Zagreb in 1972, and at the Art Pavilion in 2011. In 1993, on the centenary of his birth, Croatian Post issued a stamp featuring his self- portrait of 1929. ==Works== His paintings include * Late Autumn (Kasna Jesen), 1913 * Autoportret, 1915 * Iz Maksimira, 1915 * Man with a Red Beard (\u010covjek s crvenom bradom), 1916 * Portret dr Stjepana Pelca, 1917 * Primorska Street (Primorska ulica), 1918 * Tunis, 1920 * My Father (Moj otac), 1925 * Portret arh.
