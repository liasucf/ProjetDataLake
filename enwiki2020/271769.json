Due to its central position among the dialects of Occitan, it is often used as a basis for a Standard Occitan.Claudi Balaguer, \"Languedocian: A Central and Interface Dialect within Occitan\", in John Partridge (ed.), Interfaces in Language, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2010 About 10% of the population of Languedoc are fluent in the language (about 300,000), and another 20% (600,000) \"have some understanding\" of the language. All speak French as their first or second language. ==See also== * Occitan conjugation * Languages of France * Langue d'oc * \u00c9mile Mazuc, scholar of the Languedocien language ==References== Category:Occitan language Category:Languages of France ",
