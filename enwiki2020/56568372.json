    "text": "The Ecotive Metrocab (sometimes called New Metrocab), first presented in December 2013YouTube: MetroCab | Fully Charged, is a purpose-built electrically powered hackney carriage manufactured by Ecotive, a subsidiary of Kamkorp. The vehicle is designed to comply with Transport for London\u2019s taxi regulations, which, from 1 January 2018, ban new diesel-powered taxis and require zero-emissions capability. The vehicle is electrically powered and has a 1.0-litre petrol engine to extend its range. It is the first authorised electric-powered London black cab.Hilton Holloway, London's Electric Cab Goes Live, Autocar 11 February 2015 In March 2014 several vehicles were lent to taxi drivers for evaluation.Metrocab Video - Taxi Trade Experience Day The Metrocab\u2019s main competitor is the LEVC TX, another completely new electric taxi built to London\u2019s 2018 regulations, and successor to the well-known TX4. == Manufacturing == Prototypes were shown to the press in January 2014 and a \u201csmall fleet\u201d of vehicles were running with the taxi operator ComCab in early 2015. In May 2015 it was announced that, following a \u00a350,000,000 investment, 3,500 Metrocab vehicles per year will be manufactured by Multimatic at an expanded plant in Tile Hill, Coventry. == Technical specifications == The manufacturer claims fuel economy of 98 mpg (2.88 l/100 km) on the ECE101 cycle, a range of over 348 miles (560 km), emissions of less than 65g/km CO2 per km. It has regenerative braking and can be recharged from a mains electric outlet, as well as by its own petrol engine. It has a turning circle of 25 feet (London taxi regulations specify a maximum turning circle of 25 ft or 7.62 m). It has six passenger seats, with an optional 7th passenger seat in the front. Top speed is restricted to 80 mph. The lithium-ion polymer large format cells have a stored capacity of 12.2kWh. Peak motor power is 2 x 50 kW. Peak wheel torque is 2 x 1,400Nm. == Trademark challenge == By 2015 London Taxi Company (LTC, now London EV Company), makers of the long-running TX4 taxi, were planning their own electric taxi, the TX5. In June 2015 LTC sued the makers of the Metrocab, claiming breach of trademark. A lawyer for LTC was quoted in the press as saying \u201cIt is actually all about the shape\u201d. In his January 2016 judgement, Mr Justice Arnold rejected all of LTC\u2019s claims. He considered that \u201cboth LTC\u2019s registered trade marks, which depict models of its taxis, were invalid and that even if LTC\u2019s trade marks had been valid, they would not be infringed by the new Metrocab due to the low degree of similarity between the Metrocab and the LTC taxi\u201d.BLP successfully advises Frazer-Nash and Ecotive in London Taxi Company\u2019s trade mark appeal on new Metrocab In November 2017 the judgement was confirmed at the Court of Appeal. A Metrocab spokesman said: \u201cIt is a great pity that unnecessary time has been wasted on a false accusation \u2026 We have continued to trial, improve and develop our technology over the last three years with taxi drivers in active service and are extremely proud of our decision to design and develop the entirety of the Metrocab here in the UK. We are looking forward to getting production up and running in Coventry following the court\u2019s decision.\u201dMetrocab press release: Green light for production of world leading tech in Metrocab following case dismissal ==References== == External links == *Ecotive Metrocab site Category:Motor vehicle manufacturers of England Category:Taxicabs of London Category:Electric taxis Category:Electric vehicle manufacturers of the United Kingdom ",
