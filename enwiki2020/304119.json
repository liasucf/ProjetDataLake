Her famous disciple was Wang Xizhi. ==Biography== Born in modern Xia, Shanxi, Wei was the daughter of Wei Zhan (\u885b\u5c55) or the daughter or younger sister of Wei Heng (\u885b\u6046). Wei was married to Li Ju (\u674e\u77e9), the Governor of Ding Prefecture. Wei and Li had Li Chong (\u674e\u5145), also a calligrapher and a Palace Secretarial Attendant (\u4e2d\u66f8\u4f8d\u90ce). She was taught the style that Zhong Yao taught, however, Wei's style is narrower than Zhong's wider style. Wei's The Picture of Ink Brush (\u7b46\u9663\u5716) describes the Seven Powers (\u4e03\u52e2) that later became the famous Eight Principles of Yong. ==Works== Wei's other works include: * Famous Concubine Inscription (\u540d\u59ec\u5e16, Ming Ji Tie) * The Inscription of Weishi He'nan (\u885b\u6c0f\u548c\u5357\u5e16, Weishi He'nan Tie) ==References== * Wang, Yuchi, \"Wei Shuo\".
