The district consists of Ashland County as well as portions of Holmes and Medina counties. ==Life and career== Kick was born and raised in Loudonville, Ohio, where he was a family farmer and still farms today. An ardent Republican, Kick was involved in Republican politics for many years before becoming a state representative. When Bob Gibbs was elected to Congress in 2010, Kick was hired by Gibbs to serve as one of his district liaisons. Gibbs previously represented the predecessor to the 70th House District. ==Ohio House of Representatives== When influential Representative Dave Hall was term-limited in 2016, Kick decided to run for the seat. Against two other Republicans, Kick inched out a win, besting second place candidate Lisa Woods by 107 votes. In an incredibly Republican district, Kick won the general election with over 71% of the vote against independent Luke Brewer. == References == ==External links== *Ohio State Representative Darrell D.
