There is speculation that Thomas may have been Robert's disciple. In addition to the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Amiens, he is also believed to have worked contributed to both the Saint-Germain-en-Laye and the Sainte- Chapelle. According to analysis and evidence, Thomas de Cormont was responsible for the completion of the upper nave, chevet aisle vaults and windows, and ambulatory sometime in the 1230s. His son, Renaud de Cormont, continued his work on Notre-Dame of Amiens in the 1240s. ==References== * Category:13th-century French architects Category:Gothic architects Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:12th- century births ",
