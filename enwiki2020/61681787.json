    "text": "British Columbia (B.C.) is the third largest Canadian province by population and fourth largest provincial economy. Like other provinces in the Canadian federation, B.C. consists of both private and public institutions. However, as Canada's westernmost province, located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains, B.C. has unique economic characteristics that distinguish it from much of the rest of Canada. == Economic Geography == British Columbia's Prime Location on Canada's West Coast Geography has played a significant role in the province's economic development. B.C.\u2019s location on Canada's west coast puts it at the commercial crossroads of the Asia-Pacific region and North America. B.C. is geographically characterized by mountainous topography along with substantial areas of lowlands and plateaus. Though less than 5% of B.C.\u2019s land is arable due to mostly mountainous terrain, the province is agriculturally rich. This can be attributed to relatively mild weather along the Pacific Northwestern coast and in various sheltered valleys. There are eight economic regions within B.C. This includes: the Cariboo, Kootenay, Lower Mainland/Southwest, Nechako, North Coast, Northeast, Vancouver Island and Coast, and Thompson/Okanagan region. In addition to the many towns and cities in these regions, the province is home to over 200 First Nations, where many of these First Nations communities are actively involved in local economic development related to their traditional territories. According to the most recent census data, 86% of the population is classified as urban and is highly concentrated along B.C.\u2019s southern coast. Around 60% of B.C.\u2019s population resides in the Lower Mainland region which includes the City of Vancouver. And not far to the west is Vancouver Island, which encompasses approximately 20% of the population, including Victoria, the provincial capital. British Columbia's Economic Regions. While service-based industries dominate its cities, resource-based sectors\u2014principally forestry, agriculture, natural gas and mining, figure prominently as economic activities in less urbanized areas. == Economic History == Indigenous peoples have lived in the area now known as B.C. for more than 10,000 years, where economic activities centered around fishing, hunting and food gathering. The area was home to thousands of Indigenous peoples when European explorers began to visit in the 1750s. However, the area was difficult for early Europeans to reach, such that it was the last part of North America to be explored. It was not until the first half of the 19th century that the Hudson's Bay Company expanded to the west of the Rocky Mountains and established trading outposts. The company sought to trade with Indigenous tribes, goods such as sea otter pelts and animal furs. In 1849, Vancouver Island was colonized by the British and a lease was granted to the Hudson's Bay Company giving it exclusive trading rights on Vancouver Island. Soon after, the Gold Rush attracted tens of thousands of people to the interior areas of the province. B.C. remained a British colony until 1871 when it became a province of Canada. In 1885, the Canadian Pacific Railway was completed, linking the country from east to west. The railway increased trade and the movement of people and resources from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Around the turn of the 20th century, entrepreneurs came to B.C. to develop the province's vast natural resources and agricultural potential, ushering a period of rapid economic expansion and population growth. Major dams were built to support a growing electrical grid and the Trans-Canada Highway was completed, allowing for easier movement of goods and services. As population increased, it became concentrated around the ports in the southwest part of the province. Management and financial activities related to resource development remained in these coastal cities during this time, including Vancouver. Consumer-goods manufacturing also began in southwestern cities, due in part, to the high cost of transporting manufactured goods from eastern Canada and the US at the time. British Columbia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by Sector, 2018 British Columbia's (B.C.) British Columbia has historically been a resource-dominated economy centered on the forest industry, with fluctuating importance in mining, farming and natural gas. About 60% of British Columbia is forested, accounting for approximately 19.5% of the forested land in Canada. Today however, B.C.'s economy is more diverse, with service industries accounting for the largest portion (75%) of the province's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Over the past several decades, employment in resource industries has fallen steadily as a percentage of employment, and new job growth has occurred mostly in the construction, real estate, leasing and rental, and the retail/service sectors. == Key Economic Indicators == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+British Columbia Key Economic Indicators !Metric !2018 !2017 !2016 |- | | | | |- |GDP and Trade | | | |- |Gross Domestic Product - GDP (Millions of CAD dollars) |$288,977 |$282,204 |$263,978 |- |Real GDP (% change) |2.4 |3.8 |3.6 |- |Trade Exports (% change) |3.5 |3.4 |3.8 |- |Trade Imports (% change) |3.1 |8.0 |4.1 |- | | | | |- |Labor | | | |- |Unemployment Rate (%) |4.7 |5.1 |6.0 |- |Labor Force (% change) |1.1 |3.7 |3.0 |- |Personal Income (% change) |5.1 |6.6 |4.7 |- | | | | |- |Prices and Consumer Expenditures | | | |- |Consumer Price Index (% change) |2.7 |2.1 |1.8 |- |Retail Sales (% change) |2.0 |9.3 |7.4 |- | | | | |- |Population and Migration | | | |- |Population |4,992,000 |4,817,000 |4,752,000 |- |International Migration (people) |57,126 |49,590 |32,912 |- |Interprovincial Migration (people) |3,902 |10,202 |20,026 |} Sources: B.C.

Economic Forecast (2019-2022, 2018-2021), Central1 Credit Union == Economic Infrastructure == === Transportation === ==== Air ==== Hour Air Travel Time To And From Vancouver, British Columbia (B.C.) B.C. has six international airports, including: Victoria (YYJ), Vancouver (YVR), Kelowna (YLW), Abbotsford (YXX), Cranbrook (YXC) and Prince George International Airports (YXS). ==== Railways, Highways and Roads ==== British Columbia is the only gateway on the west coast of the Americas served by three continental Class 1 railways, connecting ports on the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf coasts to key markets throughout Canada, the United States and Mexico. British Columbia has six railways crossings into the United States. An extensive all-weather provincial highway and railway network makes transporting goods and services to North American markets seamless and reliable. B.C.'s well-maintained highway system allows efficient trucking across Canada and easy access to interstate highways in the United States. Computerized traffic management and integrated rail-truck terminals ensure effective freight transfer. ==== Sea ==== Sailing Travel Times To and From Vancouver, British Columbia (B.C.) The Port of Vancouver is Canada's largest port and the third largest port in North America; it is responsible for Canada's trade with more than 170 world economies. The ports of Vancouver and Prince Rupert, which are ice-free year-round, are Asia's closest ports of entry on the west coast of North America\u2014saving shippers more than two days travel time as compared to other west coast ports. === Energy === More than 98% of the electricity generated in British Columbia comes from clean or renewable resources. Electricity rates in British Columbia are also among the lowest in North America. British Columbia also has an abundance of natural gas, estimated at over 2,900 trillion cubic feet of marketable shale gas reserves. For more than 50 years B.C. has ranked second only to Alberta in natural gas production in Canada. In recent years, B.C. has begun to expand natural gas export capacity to markets beyond North America in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG) that can be shipped to Asia. In 2018, the Government of British Columbia launched CleanBC, a plan to reduce emissions, advance the clean tech sector and grow B.C.\u2019s low-carbon economy. === Communications and Networks === British Columbia has the highest rate of broadband and overall Internet connectivity in Canada. An extensive fiber- optic network and LTE services span the province. However, due to predominantly mountainous terrain, many sparsely populated areas of the province offer no cellphone or internet services. An advanced communications infrastructure also provides telephone, broadcasting, cable, wireless and other information services. === Health and Education === B.C.\u2019s education system includes 25 public post-secondary institutions with 165 campuses, satellites or learning centers, including 6 research universities. There are also 350 private career training institutions with more than 50,000 students attending yearly. British Columbia's trades training system currently serves more than 38,000 apprentices. The quality of education in British Columbia is considered very high and Canada has the highest proportion of working-age adults who have been through higher education among developed countries in the world. The B.C. Ministry of Health is a provincial government body responsible for the administration of British Columbia's public health system. The ministry works with health authorities, health care providers, agencies and other organizations to guide and enhance the province's health services. The quality of healthcare in British Columbia is relatively similar to other Canadian provinces. In Canada, public health insurance is available to all eligible Canadian citizens and permanent residents who can apply for provincial health coverage. In B.C., public health insurance is called the Medical Services Plan (MSP) and is managed by the Ministry of Health. === Government and Institutions === Canada, and in turn, British Columbia's system of government, is based on the British parliamentary model. Exclusive legislative powers are delineated between federal and provincial levels of government as defined by the Constitution of Canada. Municipal powers are delegated by each respective provincial legislature. Legal tender used in B.C. is the Canadian Dollar, managed at the federal level by the Bank of Canada, which is also responsible for oversight of the Canadian financial system, including banking and monetary policies. The B.C. government's annual budget is tabled for debate and vote in the provincial legislature every year in February. The Budget and Fiscal Plan is the main budget document that outlines the Province's three-year fiscal plan, including economic outlook, revenues, spending, tax measures, risks forecast and assumptions. The fiscal year runs from April to March. Healthcare, education and social development programs have historically been the largest B.C. government expenditures. British Columbia's general corporate income tax rate is 12%. When combined with the federal rate, B.C. businesses pay a general corporate income tax rate of 27%. B.C. has the lowest provincial personal income taxes in Canada for single individuals earning up to $125,000 (CAD). The sales tax rate for purchased retail goods in B.C. is 7% (PST). Both goods and services are also subject to a federal goods and services tax of 5% (GST). B.C. has one of the highest credit ratings among Canadian provinces, reflecting a strong balance sheet and depth and diversity of a fiscally stable economy. Agencies such as Moody's, Standard and Poor's, and Fitch rate B.C.\u2019s debt as AAA and stable. As of March 2019, total provincial government debt stood at $66.0 (CAD) billion \u2013 representing 22.3% of B.C.\u2019s nominal GDP. == Trade and Investment == === Trade Agreements === Companies with operations in British Columbia enjoy duty-free access to the world's largest marketplaces in Asia, North America and Europe thanks to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA). In 2018, Canada, the US and Mexico negotiated a new trade agreement to supersede NAFTA, the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA, also known as USMCA) which currently awaits ratification by governments of Canada and the United States. Domestically, British Columbia, is a member of the New West Partnership Trade Agreement, which creates a single economic region encompassing British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba: a marketplace of more than 11 million people and a GDP of more than $700 billion. === Exports === British Columbia's (B.C.) International Export Markets, 2017-2018 British Columbia's Goods and Commodity Exports, 2018 British Columbia is an important hub for goods shipped to and from Asia, and as a result, B.C.\u2019s export markets are more diversified than Canada and other provinces. While Canada typically sees over three-quarters of exports flow to the US, this market accounts for just over half of British Columbia exports. Other key markets for the province include China (15%), Japan (11%) and other Asian countries (12%). The diversification of sectors and markets reduces the vulnerability of the B.C. provincial economy from sector-specific or trading partner-specific negative impacts. === Foreign Direct Investment === Inward Greenfield Foreign Direct Investment Performance Index, Canadian Provinces 2012-16 B.C. relies on foreign direct investment (FDI) to help drive economic growth. FDI enhances the ability of businesses and countries to expand capacity, resulting in more economic activity, more jobs, new sources of tax revenue, and gains in income. From 2012\u201316, B.C. ranked second only to the province of Ontario in attracting FDI in Canada. In 2016, half of inward FDI in Canada came from the United States. Investments from Asia have increased and now account for 10% of FDI in Canada, significantly weighted in the energy and natural resource sectors. The B.C. provincial government promotes exports and FDI through a physical network of trade and investment offices around the world and through digital engagement. == Labor Force == B.C. has had the lowest unemployment rate in Canada since July 2017. The province is home to a diverse and skilled workforce, characterized as being: * Highly educated, with more than 60% having taken post-secondary education and well over a quarter possessing a university degree. * Flexible, with more than 80% employed in service industries, including a quarter in professional, educational and business support services. *British Columbia's (B.C.) Workforce by Sector of Employment British Columbia's (B.C.)Multilingual, with more than 400,000 British Columbia workers identifying one of the Chinese dialects as their first language. Another 139,000 have Punjabi as their first language. 52,000 identify themselves as speaking Korean. Over the next decade, demand for workers is expected to surpass supply in B.C. Several industries are expected to offer particularly strong job opportunities: * Green technology, digital media and life sciences, * Traditional industries such as natural resources, * Service industries, including healthcare, high-tech and retail sales. The mandatory minimum wage in B.C. is $13.85 an hour as of June 2019 and is set to rise incrementally in coming years. While the province attracts a healthy inflow of immigrants to help grow its labor force through government programs, attracting and retaining skilled workplace resources in cities with very high housing costs, poses a challenge for many B.C. businesses. == Economic Well- being == Due to a stable, sustainable economy, British Columbia compares favorably when evaluating key livability statistics. A temperate climate, cosmopolitan and culturally diverse cities, social stability, high-quality health care and education, and an abundant natural environment result in a quality of life and economic well-being that attract people to B.C. from around the world. The Mercer Human Resource Consulting Group's 2019 Quality of Living Survey ranks Vancouver first in North America and third out of 231 cities worldwide. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), an affiliate of the Economist, consistently ranks Vancouver as one of the most livable cities in the world; in 2018, the top city in the Americas and fifth globally. The EIU's rankings of 140 cities are based on stability, health care, culture, environment, education and infrastructure. While B.C. is known globally for maintaining a high standard of living and being among the best places to live and work, the cost of living, and specifically housing affordability in Vancouver is exceptionally challenging. Even though Vancouver is often ranked as the most expensive city in Canada to live due to the high cost of housing, it is still relatively modest when compared on a global scale to other major urban centers in respect to overall cost of living factors. == Sectors == B.C. Largest Companies, 2018 There were a total of 501,300 businesses in B.C. in 2017; of these, 98% were small businesses with fewer than 50 employees. Further, 83% of businesses in B.C. employed fewer than five employees, and 60% were self-employed individuals with no paid help. In 2016, close to 6,900 B.C. businesses exported goods to destinations outside of Canada. Of these, over 5,900 (or 86%) were small businesses that shipped approximately $18 billion worth of goods to international destinations, making up 43% of the total value of goods exported from the province, with an average export value per business of just over $3 million. B.C.\u2019s economy is diversified, which is reflected by a broad range of sectors that encompass its economy and largest corporations. === Aerospace === B.C.\u2019s aerospace sector is the third-largest in Canada. More than 200 companies generate a total of $1.8 billion (CAD) in revenue annually and nearly 9,000 people are employed directly.

Natural gas extraction has taken place in B.C. since the early 1950s. The northeast region of the province is where most natural gas resources can be found \u2013 in areas such as the Horn River Basin, the Montney Basin, the Liard Basin and the Cordova Embayment. There are also more than 44,000 kilometers of existing pipelines in British Columbia \u2013 gathering pipelines, transmission pipelines and the pipelines that deliver natural gas to customers. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) \u2013 a shippable form of natural gas \u2013 saw usage double globally between 2000 and 2010 and is expected to increase by another 50 per cent by 2020. The LNG Canada joint venture under development, involving Shell, Petronas, PetroChina, Mitsubishi and KOGAS, based in Kitimat, will be the first terminal in B.C. to come onstream with a large-scale LNG export capacity by 2025. Smaller scale LNG exports are planned for Fortis BC's Tilbury Island facility in Delta and by Woodfibre LNG in Squamish, owned by Pacific Oil & Gas. === Ocean Technology === Nearly 1,000 companies are active in the ocean technology sector in British Columbia.
