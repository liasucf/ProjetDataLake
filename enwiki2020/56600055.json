Establishing the chronology of W\u0142oc\u0142awek bishops, (Krak\u00f3w 1894). ==Biography== Stefan's nationality is unknown. Jan D\u0142ugosz once considers him a Pole, sometimes as a German, while contemporary sources do not give any guidelines to establish this. Initially, he was to be the provost of the cathedral chapter of W\u0142oc\u0142awek. During the reunion in J\u0119drzej\u00f3w, with the participation of princes and nobles, he appeared as the chancellor of the prince Kazimierz the Just. This congress dates back to the end of 1167 or the beginning of 1168. In J\u0119drzej\u00f3w he performed as a chancellor in Wi\u015blica, after Kazimierz became a chancellor of the district in 1173, and from 1177 he was the chancellor of the same prince. It is not known how long he operated on this office, in 1189 sources mention his successor in the person of Chancellor Mrokoty. Prior to this event, Stefan took over the new office. As a bishop of Kujawy, he is certified for the first time in the document of Kazimierz the Righteous from 1187.Jan Fija\u0142ek, Ustalenie chronologii biskup\u00f3w w\u0142oc\u0142awskich, Krak\u00f3w 1894, p.12. Janusz Bieniak, Dariusz Karczewski, Stefan (zm. mi\u0119dzy 1198 a 1206/7?), [w:] Polski s\u0142ownik biograficzny, vol43, (Warszawa-Krak\u00f3w 2004-2005), p130-131. He probably became a bishop in support of the same prince after the death of Bishop Onold (died after 1180). In 1187 he took part in the settlement of the dispute over the chapel in P\u0142ock, in 1191 he participated in the dedication of the collegiate church in Sandomierz. He supported the Norbertine monastery in Strzelno with tithing, he gave the nuns a mill in Kwieciszewo in exchange for the village of Ot\u0142oczyn. The Oliwa Cistercians gave the right to free burial. Before 1198, he consecrated the church of Saint. Of the Trinity in Lubiszewo and tithed from two villages. In 1198 he consecrated the church in \u015awiecie and had some participation in donations for the benefit of the Knights of St. John in Starogaradzie Gdanski. Jan D\u0142ugosz and the cathedral tradition give the erroneous date of the bishop's death on 1197 and the W\u0142oc\u0142awek cathedral as the place of burial. He died for sure after November 11, 1198 (the date of the consecration in \u015awiecie), and before 1206/7, when his successor Ogierz was documented. ==References== Category:Bishops of Pozna\u0144 Category:Year of birth unknown Category:12th-century births Category:12th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Medieval Polish nobility Category:12th-century Polish people ",
