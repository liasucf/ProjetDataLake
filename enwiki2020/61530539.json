    "text": "Richard John Eden (born 2 July 1922 in London), is a British theoretical physicist who researched quantum field theory, nuclear theory and S-matrix theory in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1974 he founded the Energy Research Group at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge and from 1982 to 1989 was Professor of Energy Studies there. From 1974, he served on the UK Advisory Committee for Energy Conservation. He was a founding Fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge in 1966, and from 1987 to 1999 he was Vice President of the college. He remains an Honorary Fellow. == Career == Eden received his doctorate in 1951 at Cambridge University under Paul Dirac (The Classical and Quantum Mechanics of Non-holonomic Systems), and received the Smith's Prize in 1949. In the 1950s, Eden was a leading British exponent of analytic S-matrix studies in elementary particle physics. From 1964 to 1982 he was Reader in Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge. Also in the 1950s, he attended the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.Institute of Advanced Study, Princeton. Richard Eden This experience led him to develop ideas for a College for Advanced Study in Cambridge. He was subsequently a founding Fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge in 1966, and from 1987 to 1999 he was Vice President of the college. On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the founding of Clare Hall, Lord Ashby referred to him as the \u2018Father of the Society\u2019. This compliment is reprinted in publications marking the 40th and 50th anniversaries.Clare Hall: A 50th Anniversary Portrait, ed. D.Ibbetson, M.Longair, C.Walston, Third Millennium Publishing, 2016, p. 8-14, Eden remains an Honorary Fellow. In 1972 he took up interdisciplinary energy studies. In 1974 he founded the Energy Research Group at the Cavendish Laboratory.Brief History of the Cavendish Laboratory PDF download, p. 30 and from 1982 to 1989 was Professor of Energy Studies there. From 1974, he served on the UK Advisory Committee for Energy Conservation.

In 1970 he received the Maxwell Medal Maxwell medal recipients, and in 1989 the Open Award for Distinction in Energy Economics from the British Institute of Energy Economics (BIEE) in London. His students include Michael Boris Green, John Clayton Taylor, Elliot Leader and Geoffrey C. Fox. == Publications == * Theory of nuclear models, Phys.
