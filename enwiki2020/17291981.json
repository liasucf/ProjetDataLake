    "text": "Arsenic pentafluoride is a chemical compound of arsenic and fluorine. It is a toxic, colorless gas. The oxidation state of arsenic is +5. ==Synthesis== Arsenic pentafluoride can be prepared by direct combination of arsenic and fluorine: :2As + 5F2 \u2192 2AsF5 It can also be prepared by the reaction of arsenic trifluoride and fluorine: :AsF3 \\+ F2 \u2192 AsF5 or the addition of fluorine to arsenic pentoxide or arsenic trioxide. :2As2O5 \\+ 10F2 \u2192 4AsF5 \\+ 5O2 :2As2O3 \\+ 10F2 \u2192 4AsF5 \\+ 3O2 ==Properties== Arsenic pentafluoride is a colourless gas and has a trigonal bipyramidal structure. In the solid state the axial As\u2212F bond lengths are 171.9 pm and the equatorial 166.8 pm. Its point group is D3h. ==Reactions== Arsenic pentafluoride forms halide complexes and is a powerful acceptor as shown by the reaction with sulfur tetrafluoride forming an ionic complex.An investigation of the structures of the adducts of SF4 with BF3, PF5, AsF5, and SbF5 in the solid state and in solution in HF, M. Azeem, M. Brownstein, and R. J. Gillespie Can. J. Chem. 47(22): 4159\u20134167 (1969), :AsF5 \\+ SF4 \u2192 SF3+ \\+ AsF6\u2212 ==Safety== Arsenic pentafluoride is an extremely dangerous toxin, mainly poisoning liver cells. It has a smell that is similar to vinyl chloride gas. ==See also== *List of highly toxic gases ==References== Category:Arsenic(+5) compounds Category:Fluorides Category:Arsenic halides ",
