    "text": "The fourth season of the American television series The Masked Singer premiered on Fox on September 23, 2020, following a sneak peek episode that aired on September 13. ==Panelists and host== Nick Cannon, singer-songwriter Robin Thicke, television and radio personality Jenny McCarthy, actor and comedian Ken Jeong, and recording artist Nicole Scherzinger all returned for their fourth season as host and panelists. Following controversial statements made on his podcast, it was confirmed that Cannon would remain as host of the show, after Fox accepted his apology. Joel McHale was a guest panelist on the third and fourth episodes. The panelists also engaged in a competition for the Golden Ear in this season. After each masked singer performed for the first time along with an initial clue package, each panelist wrote their first impressions-based guess at the identity of the celebrity. Those guesses were revealed after each celebrity was unmasked, with panelist scoring a point for each celebrity they got correct from their initial first impression, with the panelist with the most correct answers winning the Golden Ear. == Production == Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, various industry-adopted safety protocols were implemented for production (as well as a change in location from Television City to Red Studios Hollywood), which included that the tapings to have a virtual audience, and that the judging panel would be 8 feet apart from each other. Fox Alternative Entertainment president Rob Wade said that the show would still \"feel very much like\" past seasons, having employed \"various quarantining and various camera tricks\" to preserve the visible presence of a studio audience. Executive producer Craig Plestis stated that a goal for season four's costumes was to \"increase the bonkers level and keep the production values up\". A \"virtual audience\" was incorporated into voting. To accommodate social distancing, many of the clues packaged used animation by Bento Box Entertainment, the studio behind Bob's Burgers as opposed to live-action filming typically used for their clue packaging. ==Contestants== The season contains 16 contestants, including the first duet costume (Snow Owls) and the first puppet costume (Baby Alien). The contestants of this season are said to have a combined net worth over $398 million, 46 Grammy nominations, 23 platinum records, 10 Hall of Fame appearances, one Olympic gold medalist, collectively sold over 281 million records, appeared in over 5,475 episodes of television and 151 films, five Super Bowl appearances, four stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, three world records, one Time 100 honor, and one Oscar nominee in a major category. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; \" |+ Results |- ! rowspan=\"3\"| Stage name ! rowspan=\"3\"| Celebrity ! rowspan=\"3\"| Occupation(s) ! colspan=\"5\"| Episodes |- ! 1 ! 2 ! 3 ! 4 ! 5 |- !
