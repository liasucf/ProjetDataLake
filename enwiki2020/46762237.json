It is best known for the United States Supreme Court decision in the case Brand X vs. FCC, later titled National Cable & Telecommunications Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Services. It was founded as \"Leonardo Internet\" in 1994. Brand X Internet was formed in 1997 from those parts of Leonardo which were not sold to Verio in a transaction for which Leonardo's partners were never paid. This became a lawsuit which Verio eventually settled for $350,000. Brand X started providing primarily dialup and T1 connections as well as websites, but when DSL technology became available, Brand X moved into this area too. Brand X provides DSL services to customers in Southern California. ==References== Category:Internet service providers of the United States Category:Companies based in Santa Monica, California Category:Technology companies based in California ",
