The New York City Police Review Board proposal had been voted down in a referendum in the 1960s\u201cThe Uncivil History of the Civilian Review Board How the Issue Divided the City Three Decades Ago,\" Tamar Jacoby, Winter 1993, City Journal, http://www.city- journal.org/story.php?id=1151 and community control of the police in Berkeley had been defeated nearly 2-1 in 1971.\u201cBerkeley in the 1970s,\u201d David Mundstock, Chapter 2, http://berkeleyinthe70s.homestead.com/ Election Results: 16,144 Yes and 33,726 No on Community Control of Police. In 1972, Chanin joined the Police Initiatives Committee, where he helped work on the successful initiative campaign where voters established the PRC in Berkeley.Mundstock. The vote establishing the PRC was 25,620 Yes and 20,309 No. During Chanin's tenure on the PRC, the commission was successful in making significant changes in the BPD. The PRC established complaint procedures and held Boards of Inquiry on numerous complaints. In the policy arena, the PRC supported the procurement of bullet proof vests.Letter from PRC Secretary Diane Schroerluke to the Mayor and Council, November 18, 1974, hardcopy. It opposed the Mobile Unique Situation Team (MUST) that had been set up by Berkeley police officers on their own without departmental supervision. MUST had no real process for screening officers who were not suited for SWAT team work. The PRC disapproved the MUST team and the Berkeley City Manager\u2019s office assured the commission that the manager would abide by their recommendation on the MUST team.Hess, Nov. 5, 1975Hess, Nov. 6, 1975 The MUST team was later reconstituted as a SWAT unit which was part of the BPD and had an emphasis on hostage negotiation. The Commission also voted to reject Berkeley police participation in a controversial civil disorder management course, which had been previously attended by nine Berkeley police captains and lieutenants. \"Commissioner Jim Chanin labelled the course a 'school for counter-revolution.' Chanin cited parts of the course material which 'attempt to link up apostles of non-violent action, like Dr. Martin Luther King and Cesar Chavez, with some sort of conspiratorial revolutionary attempt to overthrow the government.'\"\"PRC Votes 'No on Police Training: Cop Civil Disorder Course Dumped,\" Daily Californian, January 22, 1976, p.1, hardcopy. Berkeley Police Chief Wesley Pomeroy ultimately refused to allow any more police attendance at the course, given by the California Specialized Training Institute in San Luis Obispo, because its political and philosophical orientation was \u201cnot neutral, gives undue importance to 'the agitator'...and leads inevitably towards confrontation.\u201d\"Police Will Shun 'Political' Seminar,\" Daily Californian, April 23, 1976, p.1, hardcopy. Chanin also attended a \u201cPolitical Violence and Terrorism Seminar\u201d course on October 14, 1976. The police chief also agreed to ban Berkeley police from attending that course as well. ==Legal career== Chanin attributes his decision to become a lawyer to his exposure to the police response to political demonstrations in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1972, he joined the Police Initiatives Committee, where he helped work on the successful initiative campaign in which voters established a Police Review Commission (PRC) in Berkeley. He was a member of the first PRC and was twice elected chairperson of the commission.\u201cPolice Unit Considered Tonight,\u201d Don Hess, Nov. 5, 1975, Daily Californian \u201cPRC Puts End to MUST Unit,\u201d Don Hess, Nov. 6, 1975, Daily Californian ===Police Litigation and Notable Civil Rights Cases=== ====Oakland Riders Case (2000-2014)==== The Allen v. City of Oakland lawsuit was filed in December 2000 by Chanin, his associate Julie Houk, and John Burris, in response to a pattern and practice of civil rights abuses by members of the Oakland Police Department (OPD) who became known as the \u201cRiders.\u201d Eventually, one hundred nineteen (119) individual plaintiffs, almost all of whom were African Americans, joined the litigation. The plaintiffs\u2019 claims involved a litany of constitutional violations, including, false arrests, unreasonable seizures, false imprisonments, the planting of evidence, excessive use of force, falsification of police reports, racially biased policing and kidnapping. Ultimately, the 119 individual plaintiffs who joined the lawsuit collectively settled their damage claims with the City of Oakland for $10.5 million.https://oaklandnorth.net/2011/12/20/twelve-years-after-the- riders-a-long-legal-process-is-reaching-its-final-stage/ As a result of this litigation, the city agreed to enact and implement institutional reforms by way of a separate, non-monetary settlement agreement, known as the Negotiated Settlement Agreementhttp://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/OPD/DOWD004998 (NSA), to prevent the recurrence of the civil rights violations that gave rise to this litigation and to bring the OPD into step with contemporary, professional policing practices. The NSA was entered as an order of the federal court on January 22, 2003. In 2012, due to the city's chronic failure to fully comply with the reforms mandated by the NSA, Chanin, along with attorneys Julie Houk and John Burris, filed a motion with the Federal Court seeking to have a receiver appointed in order to force the city and OPD to finally come into compliance with the reforms mandated by the NSA.http://colorlines.com/archives/2012/06/the_oakland_police_departments_nine- year-long.html In March 2013, the Court appointed Thomas Frazier, the former commissioner of the Baltimore Police Department, as the compliance director.https://oaklandnorth.net/2013/03/05/thomas-frazier-lead-investigator- of-occupy-oakland-response-named-opd-compliance-director/ In February 2014, the Court consolidated the duties of the Compliance Director with those of the Independent Monitor.http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Oakland-police- overseer-Thomas-Frazier-fired-5229818.php ====Scott Olsen v. City of Oakland, et al. (2011-2014)==== Chanin, along with attorneys Julie Houk and Rachel Lederman, obtained a $4.5 million settlement for military veteran Scott Olsenhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPAqvzSogzA as a result of the permanent brain injuries he suffered when he was shot in the head by a police officer with a so-called \"less lethal\" munition on October 25, 2011, during a demonstration in support of Occupy Oakland.http://www.democracynow.org/2011/10/27/iraq_war_vet_hospitalized_with_fractured In an independent investigation commissioned by the City of Oakland, numerous police officers testified that they did not witness Olsen lying on the street. Former Baltimore Police Commissioner Thomas Frazier found that \"the fact that no law enforcement officer, supervisor, or commander observed the person falling down or prostrate in the street during the confrontation was unsettling and not believable.\"\u201cIndependent Investigation: Occupy Oakland Response, October 25, 2011,\u201d June 14, 2012, The Frazier Group, 38 ====Estate of Amaro v. City of Oakland, et al. (2009-2011)==== In 2011, Chanin and attorneys Julie Houk and John Burris recovered $1.7 million from the City of Oakland in conjunction with the death of Jerry Amaro III. In 2000, Mr. Amaro was arrested and beaten by undercover, plainclothes OPD officers, and he subsequently died from the injuries he sustained during this arrest. Mr. Amaro\u2019s mother became aware of the true facts concerning the homicide only after someone within the OPD with specific knowledge of the misconduct and subsequent cover-up leaked information concerning the case to the press in 2009.http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Oakland-to-pay-1-7-million-to- Jerry-Amaro-family-2326180.php ====Warrants Class Action (2008-2010)==== In 2008, Chanin, along with attorneys Julie Houk and John Burris, filed the Oliver v. City of Oakland, et al. class action lawsuit against the City of Oakland. This case arose from a pattern and practice by the Oakland Police Department in which affidavits with false information were presented to Alameda County Superior Court judges who signed warrants authorizing the police to enter people\u2019s homes and search their persons, belongings and houses. Ultimately, over 100 individuals were identified as class members in this lawsuit. In 2010, the case settled for $6,500,000.http://www.insidebayarea.com/ci_10838218 ====Smith Class Action (2006-2008)==== In 2005, Chanin, in concert with Julie Houk and John Burris, obtained a settlement in excess of $2.2 million on behalf of Asian American women who were victimized by an on-duty Oakland police officer.

The OPD also agreed to revise its crowd-control policy, banning indiscriminate use of wooden and rubber bullets, and requiring fair warning to disperse. Plaintiff's attorney Chanin stated, \"The settlements are a vindication. It was not appropriate use of force\u2026.We got the comprehensive crowd-control policy and every single person got money, with serious compensation for the most serious injured.\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/20/national/20port.html?_r=0 \u201cOakland Nears Final Payouts for Protesters Hurt by Police,\" Carolyn Marshall, New York Times, March 20, 2006 As part of the lawsuit, Chanin took a number of depositions including that of Assistant Chief Howard Jordan in April 2005.
