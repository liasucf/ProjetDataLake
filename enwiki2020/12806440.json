Examples include The Upper Room, Our Daily Bread, and The Word Among Us. Lutheran Hour Ministries makes daily devotions specifically for the liturgical seasons of Advent and Lent, in addition to other parts of the Church Year, such as Portals of Prayer. Daily Watchwords is the daily devotional and prayer book used by the Moravian Church. Daily devotionals have a long tradition in religious communities, with the earliest known Christian example being the G\u00e6lic Felir\u00e9 written in Ireland in the Ninth Century.Hudson, Robert (ed.) (2004) The Christian Writer's Manual of Style: Updated and Expanded Edition Zondervan, Grand Rapids, Mich., p.176, They tend to be associated with a daily time of prayer and meditation. Traditionally daily devotionals came in the format of a book, with one reading passage for each day, and often a reflection and prayer related to the Scripture lesson. With the advent of online content, daily devotionals come in multiple formats including apps, blogs, websites, and emails. There continues to be a multitude of devotional books and calendars, in addition to numerous online devotionals, that are tailored to a variety of recipient, denomination, or view. Daily devotionals differ from traditional breviaries, which are used by Christians to pray the canonical hours at fixed prayer times every day, in that daily devotionals can be used at leisure. Daily devotionals, while common among Christians, can be found in many other traditions as well. Classic examples of devotionals include Leo Tolstoy's The Reading Circle.Tolstoy, Lev N.
