He authored over hundred papers and several books. D'yakonov was recognized for his pioneering work in the 60s-80s on efficient spectrally equivalent preconditioning for linear systems and eigenvalue problems. In the last decade, strengthened Sobolev spaces became D'yakonov's main topic of research, e.g., (D'yakonov, 2004). ==References== ==External links== * Evgenii D'yakonov \u2014 scientific works on the website Math- Net.Ru * * * NA Digest, V. 06, # 33 obituary on NA Digest by Andrew Knyazev.
