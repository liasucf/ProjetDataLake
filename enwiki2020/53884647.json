It is distinguished from similar greenhood orchids by its thick, flat, platform-like sinus and blunt labellum which is only just visible above the sinus. ==Description== Pterostylis obtusa has a rosette of between three and six dark green, egg-shaped, crinkled leaves, each leaf long and wide. A single shiny, bright green and white flower is borne on a flowering spike high. There are between three and five stem leaves on the flowering spike. The flowers are long and wide. The dorsal sepal curves forward in its upper half and has a thread-like tip about long. The edges of the petals are flared and the sinus is flat and platform-like with a rolled edge. The lateral sepals have thread- like tips long. The labellum is long, wide, green, blunt and is just visible above the sinus. Flowering occurs from February to June. ==Taxonomy and naming== Pterostylis obtusa was first described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The specific epithet (obtusa) is a Latin word meaning \"blunt\" or \"dull\". ==Distribution and habitat== The blunt-tongue greenhood grows among grass in moist places on the ranges and tablelands of New South Wales and on Lord Howe Island. Specimens from Tasmania are Pterostylis atrans. ==References== obtusa Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of New South Wales Category:Plants described in 1810 ",
