The 1930s D\u00fachas Folklore collection give the following accounts of a battle fought there- (1) A battle was fought in Croc\u00e1n na gCamps, Derryconnessy; Corlough. Co. Cavan. It is supposed to have been fought between the Gael and Danes. When the cavalry were coming to Croc\u00e1n na gCamps they had a row and fought a battle. The fought in Tullyvella and Conspud. It is not known which side won the battle, but they are still supposed to fight, at certain times of the year at night, and it is thought to be a bad sign of disturbance when dead people come back to fight. There are Ogham stones at Croc\u00e1n na gCampa.Historical Tradition (2) Long ago, when the early colonists came into this country, they had a big battle on the land now owned by Mr. Francis McGovern, Tonlagee, Corlough, Bawnboy, Co. Cavan. The field in which one army pitched their campaign is now called Cnoc\u00e1n na gCampa which means 'The little hill of the campus'. It is a pretty field with grass much greener than that in the neighbouring fields. Beside it, is the field where the battle was fought. It is a grey field covered with large stones which are said to be monuments to the men who fell in the battle and are buried under them. It is said that if the field was dug up, the bones of the dead would be found in it. A stream runs by the battle fields, and touches it on the two sides. The stream is almost choked up by big stones, and there are two stones among them, with old Irish writing on them. This is all the information that is available about the battle in this district. It is not known exactly what tribes had the battle, but it is known that it took place thousands of years ago. The fields are along the main road from Swanlinbar to Ballinamore.Local Place Names If the accounts of the battle are correct then the name on the 1813 map Derryhaunis could be the Irish Doire hAmhnais meaning 'The Oakwood of Combat'. ==References== ==External links== *The IreAtlas Townland Data Base Category:Townlands of County Cavan ",
