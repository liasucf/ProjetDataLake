    "text": "__NOTOC__ Campfield Kettle Hole is the name given to a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in north Northumberland, England. The site is thought to be the remains of a kettle hole, a pond formed in the void remaining after a submerged glacial calf block melted. In contemporary times Campfield Kettle Hole is a mix of bog and pond. ==Location and natural features== Campfield Kettle Hole is situated in the north-east of England, immediately south of the Anglo-Scottish border in the county of Northumberland, some south of the town of Cornhill-on-Tweed. The pond lies at above sea level within mildly undulating terrain, and is some north-south and east-west. The western end is a permanent pond; the eastern-end is prone to occasional flooding; the remainder of the pond has become peat-filled. The local area has a number of other kettle hole ponds; a second, Barelees Pond, lies east of Campfield. ==Vegetation== The kettle hole has deep waterlogged peat soils supporting a carr woodland of birch (Betula sp.) with Scot\u2019s pine (Pinus sylvestris). The woodland floor has bog-mosses (Sphagnum spp.), and hare\u2019s-tail cotton grass (Eriophorum vaginatum) with purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea) and wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia flexuosa). The western end of the pond is fringed with yellow iris (Iris pseudacorus), water plantain (Alisma plantago-aquatica) and willow (Salix spp). The perimeter has yellow iris and reed canary-grass (Phalaris arundinacea). The uncommon beetle Agabus uliginosus dispar has been recorded from the wetter areas of the site. The condition of Campfield Kettle Hole was judged to be unfavourable-recovering in 2013, with previous concerns about tree encroachment settled. ==See also== *List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Northumberland ==References== ==External links== *Natural England SSSI record for Campfield Kettle Hole Category:Ponds of Europe Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Northumberland Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest notified in 1969 ",
