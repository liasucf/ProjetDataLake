    "text": "Neopycnodonte is a genus of marine bivalve molluscs belonging to the family Gryphaeidae.ITIS This genus is very well represented in the fossil record, however the number of living species is very few. We know fossil specimens of Neopycnodonte species dating about 60 million years. Extant species have been recorded as fossils from the Miocene to the Quaternary (from 20.43 to 0.012 Ma). Fossilworks Fossil shell of Neopycnodonte navicularis ==Description== This genus includes deep-sea giant oysters with shells measuring up to 30 cm. The shells are usually brittle, inequivalve, with a left convex valve cemented to a substrate, while the right non-cemented one is flat or slightly concave. These bivalves can live for several centuries. 507 ans : l'\u00e2ge record d'une palourde, morte en 2006Ostras gigantes en C\u00e1diz ==Distribution and habitat== While about 25 million years these mollusks formed large colonies near the coast, for unknown reasons they migrated to deeper waters. They usually live in the Mediterranean canyons or along the continental margins at depths of 350 m to 750 m.Marie-Claire Fabri, Laura Pedel Bioc\u00e9noses des fonds durs du bathyal et de l\u2019abyssal Marine Bivalve Shells of the British Isles ==Species== Species within the genus Neopycnodonte include:WoRMS * Neopycnodonte cochlear (Poli, 1795) * \u2020Neopycnodonta navicularis Brocchi 1814 N. navicularis at Fossilworks * Neopycnodonte zibrowii Gofas, Salas & Taviani, 2009 ==References== Category:Gryphaeidae Category:Extant Miocene first appearances Category:Bivalve genera ",
