    "text": "Knivskjellodden or Knivskjelodden is a peninsula located in Nordkapp Municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway. It is the northernmost point on the island of Mager\u00f8ya in Northern Norway. It is sometimes considered the northernmost point of the entire continent of Europe. The nearby Kinnarodden on the Nordkinn Peninsula is the northernmost point on the mainland. The northernmost point of the country Norway is in fact Ross\u00f8ya, in Svalbard, far north. Knivskjellodden can only be reached on foot, after a long hike from a parking area near the European route E69 highway (), south of North Cape. Travel agencies that organize trips for unaware tourists often advertise the North Cape as the northern extremity of Europe, but this is not true as the Knivskjellodden is further north. ==See also== *Lindesnes, southernmost point in Norway *Extreme points of Europe ==References== ==External links== * Jan S.
