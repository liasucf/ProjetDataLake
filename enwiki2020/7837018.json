This plant is native from Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay, and it is typical of Caatinga, Cerrado, and Pantanal vegetation in Brazil. ==Toxicity== ===Exogenous=== Trunk of M. urundeuva It is reported that the plant is very susceptible to particular herbicides such as glyphosate, suggesting a restricted and proper weed management for the species. ==Potential health effects== It is believed that tannins isolated from the stem bark are of neuroprotective functions capable of reversing 6-hydroxydopamine induced toxicity. Souza et al. discovered that the tannins isolated from the stem bark also has the antiinflammatory and antiulcer potency on rodents, showing a strong antioxidant property for possible therapeutic applications. The species has shown some efficacy in therapeutic use and may turn out to be of benefit to neuro-disease patients. ==See also== *List of honey plants *List of plants of Caatinga vegetation of Brazil *List of plants of Cerrado vegetation of Brazil *List of plants of Pantanal vegetation of Brazil *Official list of endangered flora of Brazil * Phytotherapy ==References and notes== * ==External links== * Astronium urundeuva (Fr.
