Sofia became the featured artist in a bossa-inspired album project of Ivory Records by accident. After graduating, she was on her way to Japan to pursue her research scholarship grant to study hematology when she was asked to help gather research materials for the project, since she was into bossa nova since she was in high school. Aside from helping out for the lyrics, CDs, and other research materials, she was also asked to submit a demo tape so that Ivory Records would know what bossa sounds like. Sofia submitted a demo tape of the song \"Desafinado\". The record company was impressed, and then she was tapped to be a session singer. Eventually she was chosen to be the featured artist for the album. Her album, entitled Bossa Latino Lite, debuted at No.11 at Tower Records\u2019 Top 25 albums chart. Sofia's second album was released December 28, 2006, entitled In Love With Nova Bossa. On April 1, 2007, her debut album Bossa Latino Lite reached the gold mark. The awarding took place on SOP, a noontime television show in the Philippines. Her influences in music include Cynthia Alexander, Wolfgang, Paulinho Da Viola, Tom Jobim, Paulinho Moska, Big Mountain, The Corrs, Pinikpikan, Bob Aves, and Eraserheads. == Discography == Title: Bossa Latino Lite under Ivory Records Released: 2006 Number of Tracks: 18 # Waters Of March (Aguas De Marco) # The Look Of Love # Breaking Up Is Hard To Do (duet With Roji Soriano) - Sofia (duet with Roji Soriano) # Just The Way You Are # At Seventeen (Instrumental) # Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow (featuring Roji Soriano) - Sofia (featuring Roji Soriano) # Just No Ordinary Day # Let's Wait Awhile # Constantly (Instrumental) # Blue Moon (duet With Roji Soriano) - Sofia (duet with Roji Soriano) # Desafinado (Off-Key) # Moonlight Over Paris (Instrumental) # It's Too Late # Englishman In New York (featuring Roji Soriano) - Sofia (featuring Roji Soriano) # Sorry Doesn't Make It Anymore # Dance With Me # Every Little Thing (She Does Is Magic) (Instrumental) # Waters Of March ( Aguas De Marco) - Sofia (duet with Roji Soriano) Title: In Love With Nova Bossa under Ivory Records Released: 2006 Number of Tracks: 18 1\\.
