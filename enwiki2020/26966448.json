Golder and Associates, and focused on soil mechanics and ground engineering. In the 1970s, the service offering expanded to include rock mechanics. In the 1980s the company's groundwater practice evolved to encompass the broader field of hydrogeology, with particular expertise in contaminated soil and groundwater. In the early 1990s, as public awareness of environmental issues increased, Golder added biological capabilities \u2013 including aquatic and terrestrial biology \u2013 to its range of services. Hydrology and hydraulic engineering were added in the late 1990s, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), information management, cultural sciences and energy services were added in the 2000s. In the mid 2000, Golder added Environmental, Health, and Safety providing a wide range of services to assist companies in protecting their employees and the environment. Consultants can conduct studies on air, water, ergonomics, as well as evaluating health and safety programs for compliance. On site audits provide valuable information and corrective actions for employers. === Geographic expansion === The company established other offices in Canada in the early 1960s, later expanding into the United States (1968), as well as the United Kingdom and Australia (1972).
