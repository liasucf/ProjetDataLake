The INTA was established in 1942, as the Instituto Nacional de T\u00e9cnica Aeron\u00e1utica (National Institute of Aeronautics), and it was integrated in the Ministry of the Air. It has its headquarters in Torrej\u00f3n de Ardoz, near Madrid. == Organization == Its budget, \u20ac190 million in 2019, comes from the Spanish Ministry of Defence and from its own projects with the industry. As of 2017 INTA had a total of 1500 employees, 80% of them are dedicated to R&D; activities. Its two main areas of activity are research and development (for example, in propulsion, materials, remote sensing) and certification and testing (for example, in aircraft, software, metrology). == Programs and missions == ===Satellites=== Main objectives of the Nano-satellites and Mini-satellites programmes; *R&D; programmes in the field of small satellites from 20 kg to 150 kg started in 1997 after MiniSat-1 launch, to keep running internat space activities at INTA. *The systems and subsystems are mainly developed at INTA with collaborations in the R&D; work with several universities and other institutions in Spain *Development of multimission Service Modules compatible with available launchers: up to 150 kg and 60x60x80cm. *Other specific tasks or satellite units to the small business Spanish industries, to encourage their participation in space technology. *Give flight opportunities to the Spanish research community at an affordable budget target each 3\u20134 years, for new experiments and instruments, in orbit demonstration technologies, earth observation and space exploration from Low Earth orbit. A Nanosat 01's duplicate. Satellite programmes: * Intasat-1 INTA launched its first satellite, the Intasat-1, on 15 November 1974, aboard a NASA Delta rocket. * LBSAT was launched on Ariane 4 on 7 July 1995. * Minisat 01 Next satellite in orbit was Minisat 01, with its 190 kg it was launched on board of a Pegasus rocketPegasus (rocket) over the Canary Islands in April 1997. *Nanosat 01 project was created to continue with the Spanish space program of low cost satellites. It was finally put into orbit by the Ariane 5 launch vehicle in December 2004. * Nanosat 1B It was only 5 years after when Nanosat 1B . was launched on board of a Dnepr. Parallel to this research activity, a new research line was opened with MicroSat-1, which is a bit heavier at just above 100 kg and was scheduled to be launched in early 2012. NanoSat-2 SeoSat (Spanish Earth Observation Satellite) are also part of the INTA R&D; projects. * Xatcobeo launched in 2012. Developed in collaboration with Agrupaci\u00f3n Estrat\u00e9xica Aeroespacial (currently Al\u00e9n Space). * OPTOS Launched in 2013, is the most recent addition to INTA's small satellites line. OPTOS is based on the CubeSat standard (a 3U platform) but goes far beyond the usual approach for this kind of satellites. It was designed, developed and tested with a completely professional methodology as it is conceived as a technology demonstrator with the target of proving that a satellite of that size can carry out dedicated missions as bigger satellites. It was launched in November 2013 by means of a Dnepr rocket and has been successfully active in orbit since then. * Paz observation and reconnaissance satellite launched on 22 February 2018 operated jointly with Hisdesat * Ingenio optical imaging satellite * Anser All these satellites are totally Spanish in manufacture and design, comprising a low-cost multiuse platform, with modular design subsystems and standard interfaces with the payload module. ===Launchers=== INTA designed atmospheric sounding rockets such as: *Capricornio's duplicate.
