    "text": "Halcyornithidae or Pseudasturidae is a family of fossil birds, possibly belonging to the order Psittaciformes (parrots and relatives). Members of this family lived in the Eocene, around 55-48 million years ago. Fossil remains are known from the Green River Formation in the United States and from the London Clay formation in the United Kingdom. They were probably the sister group to the owl-like Messelasturidae. ==Classification== *Cyrilavis *Halcyornis *Pulchrapollia *Pseudasturides *Precursor?
