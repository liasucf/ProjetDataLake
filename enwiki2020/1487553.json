Gabe Kapler becomes the first player to hit home runs in his first two at-bats in a Texas Rangers uniform, while his teammate Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez also adds a pair of homers in a 10\u20134 Texas victory against the Chicago White Sox. Vladimir Guerrero also hits a pair of homers for the Montreal Expos, but the Los Angeles Dodgers defeat Montreal, 10-4, behind Eric Karros' grand slam.

Shortstop Kevin Elster leads the Dodgers attack with three home runs. *April 11 \u2013 The Detroit Tigers sink the Seattle Mariners, 5\u20132, in the first game played at Comerica Park in Detroit. *April 15 \u2013 The Baltimore Orioles defeat the Minnesota Twins, 6\u20134, as Cal Ripken, Jr. gets the 3,000th hit of his illustrious career.

Not only is the game memorable for Milwaukee's four-hour, 22-minute drubbing of Chicago, but also because it features one of the longest home runs in the history of Wrigley Field. A captioned picture circulated by the Associated Press put it this way: \"Rick Frohock celebrates on the rooftop of a three-story building on Waveland Ave. behind the left-field bleachers of Wrigley Field after catching a home run hit by Chicago's Glenallen Hill against the Brewers.

Henderson signs with the Mariners the day before, after being released by the New York Mets on May 13. *May 23 \u2013 The Baltimore Orioles top the Seattle Mariners, 4\u20132. Seattle's Rickey Henderson draws his 2,000th career walk in the ninth inning, making him the third player to reach that level in the majors, just behind Babe Ruth and Ted Williams. *May 29 \u2013 Second baseman Randy Velarde of the Oakland Athletics turns an unassisted triple play, just the 11th in major league history, on a line drive smashed by the New York Yankees' Shane Spencer. With runners on first and second running with the pitch, Velarde tags Jorge Posada as he nears second base, then touches the bag to retire Tino Martinez. New York wins the game, 4\u20131. In 1995, while playing with the Yankees, Velarde turned an unassisted triple play against the Los Angeles Dodgers in spring training before the 1994\u201395 strike began. ===June=== *June 1 \u2013 Japanese right-hander Tomokazu Ohka, a top prospect with the Pawtucket Red Sox, becomes the first pitcher in nearly 50 years to throw a nine-inning perfect game in the International League. Ohka retired in succession all 27 batters he faces in a 2\u20130 triumph over the Charlotte Knights.

It is believed to be the first time a major league team honored an athlete from another sport in this way. *June 21 \u2013 At the Oakland Coliseum, the Oakland Athletics defeats the Baltimore Orioles, 10\u20133, as Eric Chavez becomes the first Athletics player to hit for the cycle at home since the team moved to Oakland in 1968. *June 26 \u2013 After hitting 35 home runs in 53 Minor league games,Alex Cabrera Minor League Baseball Statistics.

His grandfather Gus Bell and father Buddy Bell also played for the Reds. ===August=== *August 4 \u2013 The Blue Jays obtain outfielder Dave Martinez from the Rangers.

According to Howe Sports data, the eight players who stole 100 or more bases in the minors were: **Vince Coleman : 145 (Macon, South Atlantic, 1983) **Donell Nixon : 144 (Bakersfield, California, 1983) **Jeff Stone : 123 (Spartanburg, South Atlantic, 1983) **Alan Wiggins : 120 (Lodi, California, 1980) **Marcus Lawton : 111 (Columbia, South Atlantic, 1985) **Esix Snead : 106 (Potomac, Carolina, 2000) **Lenny Dykstra : 105 (Lynchburg, Carolina, 1983) **Donell Nixon : 102 (Chattanooga, Southern, 1984) **Vince Coleman : 101 (Louisville, American Association, 1983) **Albert Hall : 100 (Durham, Carolina, 1980) *August 22 : **The Dodgers defeat the Expos 14-6, as Eric Karros becomes the first Dodger player to hit two home runs in the same single inning. **In the 12th inning of 6-6 tie game against the Atlanta Braves at Coors Field, Colorado Rockies manager Buddy Bell, out of pitchers, sends catcher Brent Mayne in to pitch. Mayne pitches a scoreless inning; the Rockies win the game in the bottom of the 12th as Adam Melhuse, pinch-hitting for Mayne, who is unable to swing a bat due to a sprained left wrist, singles off John Rocker to drive in Neifi P\u00e9rez with the winning run. Mayne is credited with the win, becoming the first non-pitcher to win a game in 32 years since Rocky Colavito did it on August 25, . *August 27 \u2013 The Anaheim Angels edge the Cleveland Indians 10-9, as outfielder Tim Salmon hits his 30th home run of the year in the 5th inning. The Angels become the first team in AL history to have four players (Troy Glaus, Mo Vaughn, Garret Anderson, Salmon) reach the 30-homer mark in a single season. The Toronto Blue Jays are close with two hitters over 30 and two at 28. It was done seven times in the NL. ===September=== *September 1 \u2013 For the second time in the season, pitcher Ryan Rupe of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays gives up a grand slam to Kansas City Royals outfielder Jermaine Dye. The other slam was on April 26. *September 3 \u2013 Kenny Lofton of the Cleveland Indians ties a major league record by scoring in his 18th straight game in the first inning of the Cleveland Indians' 12-11, 13-inning victory over the Baltimore Orioles. Red Rolfe set the record in 1939 for the New York Yankees. *September 4 \u2013 At Fenway Park, Carl Everett of the Boston Red Sox becomes only the sixth major- league switch-hitter to drive in 100 runs in both leagues when he knocks in his 100th RBI of the year. Boston wins over the Seattle Mariners, 5-1. Everett drove in 108 runs for the Houston Astros in 1999. The other five 100-100 switch-hitters are Ted Simmons, Ken Singleton, Eddie Murray, Bobby Bonilla and J. T. Snow. Before the game, the Red Sox honor Hall of Fame catcher Carlton Fisk.

Johnson's 3,000 strikeout victim is Mike Lowell, who fans to end the 4th inning. In the first inning, Johnson also records his 300th strikeout for the third consecutive season and the fourth time overall. Nolan Ryan is the only other pitcher to accomplish the feat, and is the only pitcher who reached 300 strikeouts more times with six (1972-74, 1976-77 and 1989). *September 12 \u2013 The Diamondbacks edge the Dodgers 5-4, despite Dave Hansen's major league record-breaking seventh pinch-hit home run of the season.
