He left the ship in Jamaica and became gardener at a public nursery, then Island Botanist. He later owned two coffee plantations. Wiles was a beneficiary of slavery from the British West Indies. The slaves on his plantations had been valued at \u00a34,160. ==Uses== The cape is the site of a high frequency radar station which is used to collect data about wind direction and wave height. Since 2012, the waters adjoining its shoreline are within a habitat protection zone in the Thorny Passage Marine Park. ==References== ==External links== *Cape Wiles - video by Cy Starkman r Category:Eyre Peninsula Category:Great Australian Bight ",
