    "text": "A side-blown sneng plays, demonstrating the multiple tones possible from the instrument. Side blown instruments may have two fingerholes, one on each end of the instrument. End-blown instruments have no fingerholes and only one note. The Sneng () is a reed aerophone, made from an ox horn or water buffalo horn and producing sound with a single free reed. Two different styles exist. The end-blown instrument has the tip of the horn cut off, with the reed inserted into that end. The tip then functions as the mouthpiece to blow a single note. The side-blown instrument has a hole in the side of the instrument's body, where a bamboo free-reed and a mouthpiece are fastened with wax. The reed there can be either blown or sucked to produce a tone. Each end of the instrument has holes that function as fingerholes to change the notes, tuned a fourth apart. The instrument was capable of two or three notes. The large hole can be covered with the player's palm, the small hole with a finger or thumb. The instrument is loud enough to call across a distance and has been used in rural environments to signal mealtimes, give warning, call for help or indicate a need to return to the village. It was also used to call domestic elephants in from the field, and hunters communicated with it. ==References== ==See also== *Abeng a similar side-blown horn in Jamaica *T\u01a1 \u0111j\u1ebfp The Vietnamese version of the instrument ==External links== *Cambodian concert, begins with Sneng solo.
