    "text": "The men's 30 metre dueling pistol (originally called individual competition with revolver and pistol (duel shooting)) was a shooting sports pistol event held as part of the 1912 Summer Olympics shooting programme. It was later standardized by the ISSF to the men's 25 metre rapid fire pistol. It was the fourth appearance of the event, as it had not been featured at the 1908 Games. The competition was held on Saturday, 29 June 1912. The format was 30 shots in 6 series of 5 shots each. Scoring was by hits on target, with ties broken by points. 30 hits were possible, with 300 points possible. Forty-two sport shooters from ten nations competed. ==Results== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
