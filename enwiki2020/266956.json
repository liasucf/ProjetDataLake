    "text": "Conflict theories are perspectives in sociology and social psychology that emphasize a materialist interpretation of history, dialectical method of analysis, a critical stance toward existing social arrangements, and political program of revolution or, at least, reform. Conflict theories draw attention to power differentials, such as class conflict, and generally contrast historically dominant ideologies. It is therefore a macro-level analysis of society. Karl Marx is regarded as the father of social conflict theory, which is a component of the four major paradigms of sociology. Certain conflict theories set out to highlight the ideological aspects inherent in traditional thought. While many of these perspectives hold parallels, conflict theory does not refer to a unified school of thought, and should not be confused with, for instance, peace and conflict studies, or any other specific theory of social conflict. == In classical sociology == Of the classical founders of social science, conflict theory is most commonly associated with Karl Marx (1818\u20131883). Based on a dialectical materialist account of history, Marxism posited that capitalism, like previous socioeconomic systems, would inevitably produce internal tensions leading to its own destruction. Marx ushered in radical change, advocating proletarian revolution and freedom from the ruling classes. At the same time, Karl Marx was aware that most of the people living in capitalist societies did not see how the system shaped the entire operation of society. Just as modern individuals see private property (and the right to pass that property on to their children) as natural, many of the members in capitalistic societies see the rich as having earned their wealth through hard work and education, while seeing the poor as lacking in skill and initiative. Marx rejected this type of thinking and termed it false consciousness, the use of misdirection by the ruling class to obfuscate the exploitation intrinsic to the relationship between the proletariat and the ruling class. Marx wanted to replace this false consciousness with something Friedrich Engels termed class consciousness, the workers' recognition of themselves as a class unified in opposition to capitalists and ultimately to the capitalist system itself. In general, Marx wanted the proletarians to rise up against the capitalists and overthrow the capitalist system. Two early conflict theorists were the Polish- Austrian sociologist and political theorist Ludwig Gumplowicz (1838\u20131909) and the American sociologist and paleontologist Lester F. Ward (1841\u20131913). Although Ward and Gumplowicz developed their theories independently they had much in common and approached conflict from a comprehensive anthropological and evolutionary point-of-view as opposed to Marx's rather exclusive focus on economic factors. Gumplowicz, in Grundriss der Soziologie (Outlines of Sociology, 1884), describes how civilization has been shaped by conflict between cultures and ethnic groups. Gumplowicz theorized that large complex human societies evolved from the war and conquest. The winner of a war would enslave the losers; eventually a complex caste system develops.Fifty Key Sociologists: the Formative Theorists, John Scott Irving, 2007, pg 59 Horowitz says that Gumplowicz understood conflict in all its forms: \"class conflict, race conflict and ethnic conflict\", and calls him one of the fathers of conflict theory.\"Communicating Ideas: The Politics of Scholarly Publishing\", Irving Louis Horowitz, 1986, pg 281 Ward directly attacked and attempted to systematically refute the elite business class' laissez-faire philosophy as espoused by the hugely popular social philosopher Herbert Spencer. Ward's Dynamic Sociology (1883) was an extended thesis on how to reduce conflict and competition in society and thus optimize human progress. At the most basic level Ward saw human nature itself to be deeply conflicted between self- and altruism, between emotion and intellect, and between male and female. These conflicts would be then reflected in society and Ward assumed there had been a \"perpetual and vigorous struggle\" among various \"social forces\" that shaped civilization.\"Transforming Leadership\", James MacGregor Burns, 2004, pg 189\"German Realpolitik and American Sociology: an Inquiry Into the Sources and Political Significance of the Sociology of Conflict\", James Alfred Aho, 1975, ch. 6 'Lester F. Ward's Sociology of Conflict' Ward was more optimistic than Marx and Gumplowicz and believed that it was possible to build on and reform present social structures with the help of sociological analysis. \u00c9mile Durkheim (1858\u20131917) saw society as a functioning organism. Functionalism concerns \"the effort to impute, as rigorously as possible, to each feature, custom, or practice, its effect on the functioning of a supposedly stable, cohesive system,\"Bourricaud, F. 'The Sociology of Talcott Parsons' Chicago University Press. . p. 94 The chief form of social conflict that Durkheim addressed was crime. Durkheim saw crime as \"a factor in public health, an integral part of all healthy societies.\"Durkheim, E. (1938). The Rules of Sociological Method. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. p. 67. The collective conscience defines certain acts as \"criminal.\" Crime thus plays a role in the evolution of morality and law: \"[it] implies not only that the way remains open to necessary changes but that in certain cases it directly prepares these changes.\"Durkheim, (1938), pp. 70\u201381. Max Weber's (1864\u20131920) approach to conflict is contrasted with that of Marx. While Marx focused on the way individual behaviour is conditioned by social structure, Weber emphasized the importance of \"social action,\" i.e., the ability of individuals to affect their social relationships.Livesay, C. Social Inequality: Theories: Weber. Sociology Central. A-Level Sociology Teaching Notes. Retrieved on: 2010-06-20. == Modern approaches == C. Wright Mills has been called the founder of modern conflict theory.Knapp, P. (1994). One World \u2013 Many Worlds: Contemporary Sociological Theory (2nd Ed.). Harpercollins College Div, pp. 228\u2013246. Online summary In Mills's view, social structures are created through conflict between people with differing interests and resources. Individuals and resources, in turn, are influenced by these structures and by the \"unequal distribution of power and resources in the society.\" The power elite of American society, (i.e., the military\u2013industrial complex) had \"emerged from the fusion of the corporate elite, the Pentagon, and the executive branch of government.\" Mills argued that the interests of this elite were opposed to those of the people. He theorized that the policies of the power elite would result in \"increased escalation of conflict, production of weapons of mass destruction, and possibly the annihilation of the human race.\" Gene Sharp (1928-2018) was a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. He is known for his extensive writings on nonviolent struggle, which have influenced numerous anti-government resistance movements around the world. In 1983 he founded the Albert Einstein Institution, a non-profit organization devoted to studies and promotion of the use of nonviolent action in conflicts worldwide.Gene Sharp biography at Albert Einstein Institution web site. Sharp's key theme is that power is not monolithic; that is, it does not derive from some intrinsic quality of those who are in power. For Sharp, political power, the power of any state\u2014regardless of its particular structural organization\u2014ultimately derives from the subjects of the state. His fundamental belief is that any power structure relies upon the subjects' obedience to the orders of the ruler or rulers. If subjects do not obey, leaders have no power. Sharp has been called both the \"Machiavelli of nonviolence\" and the \"Clausewitz of nonviolent warfare.\"Weber, Thomas. Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 2004 Sharp's scholarship has influenced resistance organizations around the world. More recently, the protest movement that toppled President Mubarak of Egypt drew extensively on his ideas, as well as the youth movement in Tunisia, and the earlier ones in the Eastern European colour revolutions that had previously been inspired by Sharp's work. A recent articulation of conflict theory is found in Canadian sociologist Alan Sears' book A Good Book, in Theory: A Guide to Theoretical Thinking (2008):Sears, Alan. (2008) A Good Book, In Theory: A Guide to Theoretical Thinking. North York: Higher Education University of Toronto Press, pg. 34-6, . * Societies are defined by inequality that produces conflict, rather than which produces order and consensus. This conflict based on inequality can only be overcome through a fundamental transformation of the existing relations in the society, and is productive of new social relations. * The disadvantaged have structural interests that run counter to the status quo, which, once they are assumed, will lead to social change. Thus, they are viewed as agents of change rather than objects one should feel sympathy for. * Human potential (e.g., capacity for creativity) is suppressed by conditions of exploitation and oppression, which are necessary in any society with an unequal division of labour. These and other qualities do not necessarily have to be stunted due to the requirements of the so-called \"civilizing process,\" or \"functional necessity\": creativity is actually an engine for economic development and change. * The role of theory is in realizing human potential and transforming society, rather than maintaining the power structure. The opposite aim of theory would be the objectivity and detachment associated with positivism, where theory is a neutral, explanatory tool. * Consensus is a euphemism for ideology. Genuine consensus is not achieved, rather the more powerful in societies are able to impose their conceptions on others and have them accept their discourses. Consensus does not preserve social order, it entrenches stratification, a tool of the current social order. * The State serves the particular interests of the most powerful while claiming to represent the interests of all. Representation of disadvantaged groups in State processes may cultivate the notion of full participation, but this is an illusion/ideology. * Inequality on a global level is characterized by the purposeful underdevelopment of Third World countries, both during colonization and after national independence. The global system (i.e., development agencies such as World Bank and International Monetary Fund) benefits the most powerful countries and multi-national corporations, rather than the subjects of development, through economic, political, and military actions. Although Sears associates the conflict theory approach with Marxism, he argues that it is the foundation for much \"feminist, post-modernist, anti-racist, and lesbian-gay liberationist theories.\"Sears, pg. 36. Conflict theory has three assumptions:Hamon, Raeann R. \"Conflict Theory.\" Encyclopedia of Family Studies (2016): 1-5. * Humans are self- interested. * Societies operate under perpetual scarcity of resources. * Conflict is pervasive and unavoidable within social groups and between social groups. ==Types== Conflict theory is most commonly associated with Marxism, but as a reaction to functionalism and the positivist method, it may also be associated with a number of other perspectives, including: * Critical theory * Feminist theory: An approach that recognizes women's political, social, and economic equality to men. * Postmodern theory: An approach that is critical of modernism, with a mistrust of grand theories and ideologies.Macionis, J., and Gerber, L. (2010). Sociology, 7th edition * Post-structural theory * Postcolonial theory * Queer theory: A growing body of research findings that challenges the heterosexual bias in Western society. * World systems theory * Race-Conflict Approach: A point of view that focuses on inequality and conflict between people of different racial and ethnic categories. * Critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences) ==Criticism== Conflict theory has been criticised for being too politicised by its association with Marx and its widespread use by advocates in numerous causes and movements. Critics also argue it downplays unity in society while taking a negative view of society as one filled with conflicts, tension and coercion.Stolley, Kathy S. The basics of sociology.
