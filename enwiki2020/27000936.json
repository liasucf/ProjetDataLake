    "text": "Molybdenum(II) acetate is a coordination compound with the formula Mo2(O2CCH3)4. It is a yellow, diamagnetic, air-stable solid that is slightly soluble in organic solvents. Molybdenum(II) acetate is an iconic example of a compound with a metal-metal quadruple bond.Girolami, G. S.; Rauchfuss, T. B. and Angelici, R. J., \"Synthesis and Technique in Inorganic Chemistry third edition\", University Science Books: Mill Valley, CA, 1999, ==Structure and bonding== It adopts the same Chinese lantern structure as related acetate dimers such as rhodium(II) acetate, copper(II) acetate, and chromium(II) acetate.Cotton, F. A.; Hillard, E.A.; Murillo, C. A.; Zhou, H.-C. \"After 155 Years, A Crystalline Chromium Carboxylate with a Supershort Cr-Cr Bond\" J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2000, 122, 416-417. . Each Mo(II) center in Mo2(O2CCH3)4 has four d valence electrons. These eight d-electrons form one \u03c3, two \u03c0 bonds, and one \u03b4 bond, creating a bonding electron configuration of \u03c32\u03c04\u03b42. Each of these bonds are formed by the overlapping of pairs of d orbitals.Blaudeau, J. P.; Pitzer, R. M. \u201c Ab Initio Studies of Ligand Effects on the Metal-Metal Bond in Dimolybdenum Complexes\u201d J.Phys. Chem. 1994, vol. 98, pp. 4575-4579. The four acetate groups bridge the two metal centers. The Mo-O bond between each Mo(II) center and O atom from acetate has a distance of 2.119 \u00c5, and the Mo-Mo distance between the two metal centers is 2.0934 \u00c5. ==Preparation== Mo2(O2CCH3)4is prepared by treating molybdenum hexacarbonyl (Mo(CO)6) with acetic acid. The process strips CO ligands from the hexacarbonyl and results in the oxidation of Mo(0) to Mo(II).Brignole, A.G.; Cotton, F.A., \u201cRhenium and Molybdenum compounds containing quadruple compounds\u201d Inorg.

The reaction of HO2CCH3 and Mo(CO)6 was first investigated by Bannister et al. in 1960. At the time, quadruple metal-metal bonds had not yet been discovered, so these authors proposed that Mo(O2CCH3)2 was tetrahedral.Bannister, E.; Wikinson, G. \u201cMolybdenum(II) carboxylates\u201d Chem. Ind. 1960, 319.Stephenson, T.A.; Bannister, E.; Wilkinson, G. \u201cMolybdenum(II) Carboxylates\u201d J. Chem. Soc., 1964, pp. 2538. This perspective changed with Mason's characterization.D. Lawton, R. Mason \"The Molecular Structure of Molybdenum(II) Acetate\"J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1965, vol 87, pp 921\u2013922. ==Applications== Mo2(O2CCH3)4 is generally used as an intermediate compound in a process to form other quadruply bonded molybdenum compounds. The acetate ligands can be replaced to give new compounds such as [Mo2Cl8]4\u2212 and Mo2Cl4[P(C4H9)3]4.Tsai, Y.C.; Chen H.Z.; Chang, C.C.; Yu, J.K.; Lee, G.H.; Wang, Y.; Kuo, T.S. \u201cJourney from Mo- Mo Quadruple Bonds to Quintuple Bonds\u201d J.
