By 2005, he covered a wide range of music, such as Jamaican dancehall music and Maryland's Baltimore Club music. === Mobile music 2005=== Prior to 2005, most ring tones were based on polyphonic or even cruder monophonic tones because that was what most cell phone handsets could play. However, with snippets of existing songs and compositions generating more than $2 billion in annual worldwide revenues in 2005 as ring tones, cell phone handset manufacturers began producing handsets capable of replaying the upper and lower notes from a song's melody without tinny- sounding bleats. In early 2005, retailer Best Buy turned music Shayman had written for one of its commercials into a ring tone and offered it on the Best Buy website. From this, Shayman was one of the first to recognize the business potential in composing original ring tone material exclusively for cell phones and collaborated in 2005 with music producer Eddie O'Loughlin, and singer/songwriter Dee Robert in the new mobile music art form to produce original ring tones for Jamba!. === Kevin Federline work=== In 2005, Shayman produced \"Y'all Ain't Ready\", the first single from Britney Spears' then- husband Kevin Federline.Huhn, Mary.
