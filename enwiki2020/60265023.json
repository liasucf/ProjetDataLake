    "text": "The Head Hunter (originally titled The Head) is a 2018 American fantasy horror film directed by Jordan Downy, who also co-wrote, produced, and edited the film. It stars Norwegian actor Christopher Rygh as the title character, Cora Kaufman, and Aisha Ricketts. The film centers on the title character, who works as a bounty hunter for a local kingdom, all the while he awaits the eventual return of the creature responsible for the murder of his daughter. Influenced by Jean-Jacques Annaud's 1981 film Quest for Fire, as well as The X-Files, and Tales From the Crypt television series, The Head Hunter was developed by Downey and Kevin Stewart, with the location in mind long before the film's story was eventually developed. The initial concept for the film later came about during a writer's retreat, in which the filmmakers had assembled and hosted at Stewart's family home in Soutelo Mourisco, a small village in Northern Portugal. Norwegian actor Christopher Rygh was cast as the leading role, in his feature-film debut, after filmmakers discovered him while searching a casting website. Principal photography later began in Bragan\u00e7a, Portugal, while additional scenes were shot in Norway, and Mammoth Lakes, California. The Head Hunter first premiered at the Sitges Film Festival on October 6, 2018, as a part of the festival's \"Panorama Fant\u00e0stic\" section. While the film was screened at Sitges, and Nightmares Film Festival under the title The Head, but the title was later changed to The Head Hunter due to lukewarm reactions. The film would garner several awards and nominations at the various film festivals it was screened at, and received positive reviews from critics upon its release, with many praising the film's atmosphere, cinematography, and Rygh's performance. ==Plot== In the Dark Ages, after losing his daughter, a fierce warrior begins amassing a gruesome collection of heads of monsters he stakes to the wall of his cabin.

When the horn from the nearby castle blows its a sign that a new bounty is posted; a scroll wrapped on a arrow pinned to a tree. Throughout he is shown taking the bounty, leaving to hunt down his targets as a professional Head Hunter, coming back wounded and maimed. One of his bounties results in the death of his horse. Soon after making a grave for his companion and visiting his daughter\u2019s grave another bounty is posted, much to his surprise it\u2019s the monster that killed his daughter.

He finds out what has transpired after testing the medicine on a dead spider and now has to hunt the monster down again. With nightfall now arrived, the Father begins a game of wits against The Head, with The Head trying to attach itself to the Father\u2019s body to replace the one he removed it from.

After severing it from her body he chases it down to a cave were he stabs it brutally till it\u2019s dead again.

Downey had previously directed several short films, including the 2014 short Critters: Bounty Hunter (based on the film franchise of the same name), making his feature-film debut with the 2008 comedy-horror film ThanksKilling. After the completeion of several short films, as well as the third film in the Thankskilling series, Downey and his frequent collaborator Kevin Stewart began developing their next project. Initially, the film's story was not immediately forthcoming, as Downey later recalled, \"We didn't have the idea first, we just had this drive to make a movie [...] So we just sat down, to see if we could come up with something that we could shoot for a low budget.\" The initial concept for the film later came about during a writer's retreat, in which the filmmakers had assembled and hosted at Stewart's family home. At the retreat, the filmmakers had envisioned a scene in which a lone warrior carrying a severed head inside a sack, stumbling into a room filled with heads mounted on the walls. With this scene in mind, the filmmakers then developed a forty-page script, which contained very little dialogue, describing it as a medieval horror film. From the outset, both Downey and Stewart knew that the film would be low budget, and feature a very small cast, which was all factored into the film's script. For inspiration, Jordan Downey and Kevin Stewart have cited Jean-Jacques Annaud's 1981 film Quest for Fire, Robert Eggers' The Witch, as well as The X-Files, and Tales From the Crypt. ===Pre-production=== Early on in pre-production of the film, the two filmmakers had decided to shoot the film around Stewart's family home in Soutelo Mourisco, a small village in Northern Portugal, due to the remoteness of its location. The filmmakers had wanted to utilize the location for some time, feeling that its remoteness and scenery \"would lend itself very well to a horror movie\". For the titular character, the filmmakers wanted the role to look and feel authentic, refusing to cast an American actor in the role as they felt that it would not be appropriate for the time period and feared that it would end up 'looking fake'. Norwegian actor Christopher Rygh was later cast as the leading role, in his feature-film debut, after filmmakers discovered him while searching a casting website. Downey later recalled, there was no formal audition for the role, with the filmmakers casting Rygh after having a conversation with the actor in regards to the role. Construction of the film's props and various monsters in the film commenced before the script was completed, with the filmmakers experimenting with the designs and techniques that would be implemented on a low budget. In creating the look and feel of decomposition in the severed heads featured in the film, the production crew reappropriated many old Halloween masks by staining them and placing layers of melted plastic over them in order to create the effect of rotting flesh. Other props for the film were purchased inexpensively by the production crew the day after Halloween, as Downey recalled \"we just bought every medieval thing in there we could find. Every plastic sword or shield, skeletons, and skulls, anything that just looked kind of creepy, crawly, medieval, or metal. We bought it all.\" The title character's armor was created by Swedish costume designer Andr\u00e9 Bravin, who fashioned it out of leather. Downey later described the armor as 'being more Leatherface-esque, rather than a Game of Thrones-style vibe', with faces and skin appearing stitched into the entire outfit. The film's main antagonist, referred at the end credits as \"The Head\", was designed Troy Smith, who had previously worked with Downey in both his Thankskilling series and Critters: Bounty Hunter. ===Filming=== Principal photography began in Bragan\u00e7a, Portugal, while additional scenes were shot in Norway, and Mammoth Lakes, California. With very little dialogue featured in the film, Downey later stated that he had always been drawn to films that centered more on visual storytelling rather than relying on dialogue to convey the story. In order to combat the film's low budget, the variety of creatures that appear throughout the film are only shown in glimpses or merely implied, the film's low budget also limited the amount of production crew the filmmakers could hire, which, according to Stewart, only consisted of three other people, including himself and Downey. Shooting occasionally proved challenging, as the costumes, and props had to be shot in a certain way in order to \"look right on camera\", and crew members, including Downey, performing multiple roles during production. The climactic fight sequence was shot in a water mine, after on of Stewart's cousin's suggested it as a possible location to film. The scene was devised as a way to enhance the threat of \"The Head\", by forcing the title character to fight it at less than full strength, as he is unable to use the weapons that he is accustomed to fighting with. Shooting at the location, as Downey later stated, proved to be the most difficult, and frustrating portion to shoot, with cast and crew members forced to enter the location one at a time. Later the recalling the cave's conditions, Downey noted: \"It was really crammed, dark and there were spiders and water up to our ankles and knees. The torch was putting off fumes and there was no ventilation.\" Downey later developed a cold after shooting at the location. Rygh, who had previously starred in the Norwegian short film Ulfberht, was described by Downey as being easy to work with, and never once complained on set. ==Release== ===Theatrical release=== The Head Hunter first premiered at the Sitges Film Festival on October 6, 2018 as a part of the festival's \"Panorama Fant\u00e0stic\" section. It was later screened at the Nightmares Film Festival on October 20, 2018. While the film was screened at Sitges, and Nightmares Film Festival under the title The Head (the name of the film's main antagonist), the title was later changed to The Head Hunter. According to filmmakers Downey and Stewart, the reason for the change was mainly due to lukewarm reactions under the initial name, with the film's distributor, Vertical Entertainment, suggesting a change in the film's title. After \"combing through all kinds of medieval literature\", the filmmakers later came up with the film's current title. Downey and Stewart were originally against the name change, but later embraced it as they felt the current title shifted the focus from the antagonist to the main character. Under the new title, the film was screened at the Ins\u00f3lito Festival de Cine de Terror y Fantas\u00eda on February 7, 2019. It would also be screened at the Fantasporto Film Festival later that month on the 24th. It received a limited theatrical release on April 5, 2019. ===Soundtrack release=== Official soundtrack for The Head Hunter was composed by Nick Soole, and was later released on CD and Digital download on April 8, 2019. The soundtrack was a later played as a part of an official selection of Soole's works during the 2019 San Diego Comic Con's \"Sounds of Horror\" Panel on July 19, 2019. ====Track listing==== ===Home media=== The Head Hunter was released via Video on Demand, cable, and digital media on April 5, 2019. It was later released on DVD by ADNA Films and Lionsgate on May 7, 2019. It grossed a total of $44,652 in domestic video sales. ==Critical reception== The Head Hunter received positive reviews from critics upon its release, with many praising the film's atmosphere, cinematography, and Rygh's performance. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, The Head Hunter holds an approval rating of 100%, based on 14 reviews, and an average rating of 7.22/10. Sandy Schaefer from Screen Rant wrote, \"While he clearly had limited resources to draw from here, Downey is nevertheless able to deliver a mean and lean tale of revenge with a surprisingly rich sense of atmosphere. Armed with a pulpy spirit and plenty of monster gore to go around, The Head Hunter makes for enjoyably gnarly fantasy horror B-movie entertainment.\" John Squires of Bloody Disgusting offered the film similar praise, writing, \"Brutal, bloody, gnarly and atmospheric as can be, The Head Hunter is medieval horror gold, as well as one of the coolest and craziest horror movies I\u2019ve seen in a long time.\" Janel Spiegel from HorrorNews.net praised the film's atmosphere, cinematography, as well as the film's suspense, originality, and Rygh's performance. Noel Murray of the Los Angeles Times praised the film's \"refreshing simplicity\", as well as the cinematography, Rygh's performance, and action sequences. Jonathan Barkan from Dread Central rated the film four out of five stars, writing, \"The Head is a testament to independent filmmaking. Created by a skeleton crew on a meager budget with limited supplies, it is overflowing with imagination and atmosphere.\" Joblo Jake Dee gave the film a score of nine out of ten, praising the film's atmosphere, visuals, mounting tension, and third act, hailing it as a fine example of low-budget filmmaking. Dee's only criticism was directed towards the 'wandering' second act. Kenneth Lowe of Paste Magazine wrote: \"If The Head Hunter had come in with a bigger budget and a different director, there would have been all sorts of attempts at injecting silly lore into this pure and primal tale. It may feature just one or two fight scenes, no cackling wizards or captive princesses, but it manages to evoke that spirit while also telling a straightforward horror story.\" Gaming and culture website Polygons Rafael Motamayor favorably compared to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead II, and the fantasy video game Skyrim. In his review, Motamayor praised the film's production values, practical effects, and atmosphere. ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" ! scope=\"col\"| Award ! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony ! scope=\"col\"| Category ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:30%;\"| Recipient(s) and nominee(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Nightmares Film Festival | rowspan=\"2\"| October 21, 2018 | Best Cinematography Feature | Kevin Stewart | | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Best Overall Feature | Jordan Downey | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\"| Fantaspoa International Fantastic Film Festival | rowspan=\"1\"| June 4, 2019 | Best Special Effects | Kevin Stewart Jordan Downey Ricky Fosheim Troy Smith | | rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Fantasporto | rowspan=\"2\"| March 2, 2019 | Best Actor | Christopher Rygh | | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Best Portuguese Film | Kevin Stewart Jordan Downey Ricky Fosheim | |} ==See also== * Black Death- A 2010 horror film set in the same era. == References == == External links == * Official website * * * * Category:2018 films Category:2018 horror films Category:2010s fantasy films Category:2010s monster movies Category:American films Category:American fantasy films Category:American monster movies Category:Dark fantasy films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in the 14th century Category:Films shot in California Category:Films shot in Norway Category:Films shot in Portugal Category:Human trophy collecting ",
