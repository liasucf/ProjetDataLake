Board of Education|| 1954 || In 1951, a group of parents filed a suit on behalf of their children because they wanted to end racial segregation in the school system. They felt that their children were not being treated fairly and that the schools did not have enough trained staff. The facilities that held the schools were poorly maintained as well. The law stated that they would provide schools for blacks, but the only problem was that they did not keep it to the same standard as the white schools. This in turn was a disadvantage to black children. One child had to walk quite a distance to get to her bus stop that took her to her segregated school. The families that were involved in this civil suit tried to enroll their children in the neighborhood schools that they lived in that offered better accommodations and resources. But each school denied them enrollment. These families lived in areas that were integrated. Their children played with other children from all different nationalities. Those poor children had no idea why they could not go to school with the kids that they played with in their neighborhoods. This was not ok with those parents and they decided to fight for their children to have equal rights. It took a while before the case was heard finally in 1953, but they still couldn\u2019t come to a decision. In 1954, the court decided that the concept of separate but equal was not appropriate or right in the educational setting. ||This landmark case impacts all educators around the world. It has had direct impact in my life because I teach at a school where there are many different cultures present. Without this case those wonderful students would not be there in my classroom. It gives the right of an education to everyone, rather than just a select few. It promotes acceptance of each other. || |- | Engel v. Vitale || 1962 || There was New York state law that required all public schools to begin their day with the Pledge of Allegiance and a nondenominational prayer. Students could choose to not participate if they did not want to. A parent sued saying it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The court ruled that it was in violation of the clause. || This has affected education practices today by making sure there is a separation of church and state. Prayers are not to be initiated by schools. Public schools should not sponsor a specific religion as it is part of the First Amendment to keep the government and religion separate. || |- | Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District || 1969 || In 1965 a group of students decided to wear black armbands to protest the Vietnam War. On December 14, 1965 the administration of the school met and determined that any student caught wearing a black armband would be told to remove it. Any student who did not comply would be suspended. The parents of five students who were suspended sued the school district for violating the students\u2019 right of expression. The district court dismissed the case because it found that the actions of the school helped to maintain discipline. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the decision for the Eighth Circuit. The students took the case on to the United States Supreme Court. In 1969, by a decision of 7-2, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the students. The U.S. Supreme determined that the administration suspended the students for fear of disruption instead of any actual disruption. || Students have a freedom of expression, but they cannot act in a manner that is disruptive to education. The court pointed out that to single out a student or a group of students because the administration disagrees with them is not legal. || |- |} Category:United States education case law ",
