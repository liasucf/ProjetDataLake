It is typically linked to one of several cytotoxic agents, yielding antibody-drug conjugates : * Cantuzumab mertansine * Cantuzumab ravtansine ==huC242 targets CanAg== \"HuC242 binds to the extracellular domain of the tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen known as CanAg (a novel glycoform of MUC1). CanAg is strongly expressed in most pancreatic, biliary, and colorectal cancers. It is also expressed in a substantial proportion of gastric cancers (55%), uterine cancers (45%), non- small cell lung cancers (40%), and bladder cancers (40%).\"A Phase I Study of Cantuzumab Mertansine Administered as a Single Intravenous Infusion Once Weekly in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors.
