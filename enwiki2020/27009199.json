The hardware was used primarily for Konami's Bemani series of music video game arcades, most commonly the Dance Dance Revolution series introduced in 1998. The System 573 is available in two variants with analog and digital I/O boards, dubbed the Bemani System 573 Analog and Bemani System 573 Digital respectively, along with a third variant called the System 573 Satellite Terminal which allows for up to 8 cabinets to be networked to a central one. The name of the board is rooted in Japanese wordplay; each number in Japanese can be read with a number of different names, with Konami's name being one of many possible readings for \"five-seven-three.\" ==Technical specifications== *Central processor: 33.8688 MHz MIPS R3000A RISC processor, 4KB cache *Memory: 2MB (main), 2MB (video), 512KB (sound) *Sound processor: PlayStation SPU, MAS 3507-D MPEG 1/2 decoder chip for decoding 573 Digital game audio. *Operating resolution: 256x224 & 740x480 ==List of System 573 games== ===System 573=== *Fighting Mania *Fisherman's Bait *Gun Mania *Hyper Bishi Bashi *Jikky\u014d Powerful Pro Yaky\u016b EX *Konami 80's Arcade Gallery ===Bemani System 573 Analog=== *Dance Dance Revolution (Dancing Stage in Europe) *Dance Dance Revolution 2ndMix and variants *Dancing Stage featuring True Kiss Destination *Dancing Stage featuring Dreams Come True *DrumMania *GuitarFreaks *GuitarFreaks 2ndMix ===Bemani System 573 Digital=== *Dance Dance Revolution 3rdMix and variants *Dance Dance Revolution 4thMix and variants *Dance Dance Revolution 5thMix *DDRMAX Dance Dance Revolution 6thMix *DDRMAX2 Dance Dance Revolution 7thMix *Dance Dance Revolution Extreme *Dancing Stage featuring Dreams Come True *Dance Maniax *DrumMania 2ndMix through 10thMix *GuitarFreaks 3rdMix through 11thMix *Mambo a Go Go *Martial Beat ===System 573 Satellite Terminal=== *Monster Gate *Monster Gate 2 *Monster Gate 3 ==References== ==External links== *System 16 - Bemani System 573 Analog Hardware (Konami) Category:Arcade system boards Category:Bemani games Category:MIPS architecture ",
