In the dialogue that results, the young man refers to the novella The Double: A Petersburg Poem by Dostoevsky. While the younger man cites his romantic vision about a brotherhood of man, the older Borges reveals his doubt about the existence of a single man. Following incorrect information that the first provides, elder Borges concludes that it is a real episode for him, but a dream for the younger. The story is originally written in Spanish but was translated in English in 1977. Category:Short stories by Jorge Luis Borges Category:1972 short stories ",
