The 10th Canadian Parliament was in session from January 11, 1905, until September 17, 1908. The membership was set by the 1904 federal election on November 3, 1904. It was dissolved prior to the 1908 election. It was controlled by a Liberal Party majority under Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the 8th Canadian Ministry. The Official Opposition was the Conservative/Liberal-Conservative, led by Robert Borden. The Speaker was Robert Franklin Sutherland. See also List of Canadian electoral districts 1903-1907 for a list of the ridings in this parliament.
