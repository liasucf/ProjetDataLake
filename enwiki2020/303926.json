Her childhood experiences were the focal points of her work. Ditlevsen was married (and divorced) four times.Kvinfo.dk Tove Ditlevsen (Kvinfo is a Danish encyclopedia about notable Danish women) In her life, Ditlevsen published 29 books including short stories, novels, poetry and memoirs. Female identity, memory, and loss of childhood are recurring themes in her work. She began writing poems at the age of ten. Her first volume of poetry was published in her early twenties. In 1947, she experienced popular success with the publication of her poetry collection Blinkende Lygter (Flickering Lights). The Danish Broadcasting Corporation commissioned her to write a novel, Vi har kun hinanden (We only have each other), which was published in 1954 and broadcast in installments on the radio. Three of her books, Barndom (Childhood), Ungdom (Youth), and Gift (meaning both poison and married), form an autobiographical trilogy. The trilogy was translated into English in 2019 under the titles Childhood, Youth and Dependency and referred to as The Copenhagen Trilogy. Ditlevsen also authored a column in the weekly Familie Journalen, responding to letters from readers. Throughout her adult life, Ditlevsen struggled with alcohol and drug abuse, and she was several times admitted to a psychiatric hospital, a recurring theme in her later novels. She died by suicide in 1976 due to an overdose of sleeping pills. == Recognition and legacy == Ditlevsen was awarded the Tagea Brandt Rejselegat in 1953 and De Gyldne Laurb\u00e6r in 1956.
