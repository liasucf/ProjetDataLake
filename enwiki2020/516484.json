    "text": "In the 1892 Quebec general election on March 8, 1892 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent Quebec Conservative Party, led by Charles-Eug\u00e8ne Boucher de Boucherville, defeated the Quebec Liberal Party, led by F\u00e9lix-Gabriel Marchand. Mercier had been accused of corruption and removed from office as Premier by Quebec Lieutenant- governor Auguste-R\u00e9al Angers on December 16, 1891. The scandal probably influenced the outcome of the election. Mercier gave up the post of Liberal leader (and leader of the Opposition) to F\u00e9lix-Gabriel Marchand, and was later acquitted of all charges. Boucher de Boucherville resigned a year later, and was replaced by Louis-Olivier Taillon as Conservative leader and premier. Taillon in turn resigned in 1896, and was replaced by Edmund James Flynn. Flynn lost the 1897 election, and the Conservatives never held power in Quebec again. ==Results== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\" |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" !rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party !rowspan=\"2\"|Party leader !rowspan=\"2\"|# of candidates !colspan=\"3\"|Seats !colspan=\"3\"|Popular Vote |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" |align=\"center\"|1890 |align=\"center\"|Elected |align=\"center\"|% Change |align=\"center\"|# |align=\"center\"|% |align=\"center\"|% Change |Conservative | Charles-Eug\u00e8ne Boucher de Boucherville |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| 23 !align=\"right\"| 51 |align=\"right\"| +122% |align=\"right\"|91,579 |align=\"right\"| 52.41% |align=\"right\"| +7.02% | F\u00e9lix-Gabriel Marchand |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|43 !align=\"right\"|21 |align=\"right\"|-51.2% |align=\"right\"|76,280 |align=\"right\"| 43.65% |align=\"right\"|-0.86% |colspan=2|Independent Conservative |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|1 !align=\"right\"|1 |align=\"right\"|- |rowspan=2 align=\"right\"|6,892 |rowspan=2 align=\"right\"| 3.94% |rowspan=2 align=\"right\"|-6.7% |colspan=2|Other |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|6 !align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"|-100% |- |colspan=\"3\"|Total !align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|73 !align=\"right\"|73 !align=\"right\"|- !align=\"right\"|174,751 !align=\"right\"|100% |align=\"right\"| |- |} ==See also== * List of Quebec premiers * Politics of Quebec * Timeline of Quebec history * List of Quebec political parties * 8th Legislative Assembly of Quebec Quebec general election Category:Elections in Quebec General election Quebec general election ",
