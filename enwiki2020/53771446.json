    "text": "The 75 mm 50 caliber Pattern 1892 was a Russian naval gun developed in the years before the Russo-Japanese War that armed the majority of warships of the Imperial Russian Navy during the Russo-Japanese War and World War I. The majority of ships built or refit between 1890-1922 carried Pattern 1892 guns. During its career the role of the guns evolved from one of anti-torpedo boat defense to coastal artillery and anti-aircraft use. ==History== In 1891 a Russian naval delegation was shown three guns designed by the French designer Canet. One was a 75 mm/50 caliber gun, one a 120 mm/45 caliber gun and the last was a 152mm/45 caliber gun. All three guns used fixed QF ammunition which produced a rate of fire of 15 rpm for the 75 mm gun, 12 rpm for the 122 mm gun and 10 rpm for the 152 mm gun. The Russians were impressed and in 1892 they negotiated a production license for all three guns. ==Construction== 75mm/50 caliber Pattern 1892 guns were produced at the Obukhov factory and the Perm factory between 1892 and 1922. By 1901 the Obukhov factory had produced 234 guns, with another 268 produced between 1909-1917. The Perm factory produced 70 guns between 1900-1907, with another 155 produced between 1914-1922. The original naval mounts produced between 1892-1913 had low angles of elevation -7\u00b0 to +20\u00b0. Mounts produced between 1914-1928 were high angle mounts -7\u00b0 to +75\u00b0 suitable for use as coastal artillery and anti-aircraft guns. ==Coastal Artillery & Anti-Aircraft Use== It is estimated that 100 guns were left behind by the Russians in 1917 and used by the Finns. The majority of guns came from Russian coastal artillery installations with a smaller number being captured aboard warships the Russian Navy left behind. In 1924 the Finns still had 95 coastal artillery and anti-aircraft guns in their inventory. In 1941 it was estimated there were still 69 guns in active service with the Soviet Navy. In 1944 Finnish coastal artillery and Navy still had 66 guns, of which 10 guns were serving on ships. ==Naval Use== 75/50 guns armed a variety of ships such as armored cruisers, destroyers, dreadnought battleships, gunboats, light cruisers, minelayers, minesweepers, Pre-dreadnought battleships, protected cruisers and submarines of the Imperial Russian Navy. After the 1917 October Revolution the successor states of Estonia, Finland, Poland and the Soviet Union all used this gun. The last Finnish warship to carry 75/50 guns was the minelayer Ruotsinsalmi, which was decommissioned in 1975.
