It was composed by Alex Pall and Andrew Taggart, with lyrics written by Pall, Taggart, Emily Warren, Chelsea Jade and production handled by Shaun Frank and the duo.

The artwork features a heart-shaped steak on a plate, surrounded by red vegetables. They posted an audio preview the day after. The song was compared to Twenty One Pilots' change of sound, with the duo having switched their electronic dance music style for \"palm-muted, pop-punk guitars and an occasional synth line\" and a \"radio-friendly\" alternative rock sound. ==Production== Production of the song was described as consisting of \"soft horn\" and a repetitive guitar chord. The song is described as a \"dark and brutal portrayal of depression and the media's influence on their recent lives.\" ==Music video== The music video, directed by Rory Kramer, features the Chainsmokers as vampires who eat their guests after meticulously cleaning their mansion. ==Track listing== ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from Tidal. * The Chainsmokers \u2013 production, record engineering * Emily Warren \u2013 piano * Shaun Frank \u2013 production, mix engineering * Chris Gehringer \u2013 master engineering ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA) | 73 |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ireland (IRMA) | 81 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Heatseekers (RMNZ) | 1 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) | 55 |- |- |- |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Version ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| Various | February 16, 2018 | rowspan=\"2\"| Digital download | Original | rowspan=\"2\"| | |- ! scope=\"row\"| United States | March 9, 2018 | Remixes EP | |} ==References== Category:2018 singles Category:2018 songs Category:The Chainsmokers songs Category:Songs written by Andrew Taggart Category:Songs written by Emily Warren (songwriter) Category:Columbia Records singles Category:Songs written by Alex Pall Category:Vampires in music ",
