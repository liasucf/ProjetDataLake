    "text": "In geometry, the elongated gyrobifastigium or gabled rhombohedron is a space- filling octahedron with 4 rectangles and 4 right-angled pentagonal faces. == Name== The first name is from the regular-faced gyrobifastigium but elongated with 4 triangles expanded into pentagons. The name of the gyrobifastigium comes from the Latin fastigium, meaning a sloping roof.. In the standard naming convention of the Johnson solids, bi- means two solids connected at their bases, and gyro- means the two halves are twisted with respect to each other. The gyrobifastigium is first in a series of gyrobicupola, so this solid can also be called an elongated digonal gyrobicupola. Geometrically it can also be constructed as the dual of a digonal gyrobianticupola. This construction is space-filling. The second name, gabled rhombohedron, is from Michael Goldberg's paper on space-filling octahedra, model 8-VI, the 6th of at least 49 space-filling octahedra.Goldberg, Michael, On the space-filling octahedra, Geometriae Dedicata, January 1981, Volume 10, Issue 1, pp 323\u2013335 PDF A gable is the triangular portion of a wall between the edges of intersecting roof pitches. ==Geometry== The highest symmetry forms are D2d, order 8, while if the underlying rectangular cuboid is distorted into a rhombohedron, the symmetry is reduced to 2-fold rotational symmetry, C2, order 2. It has all 3-valence vertices and its dual has all triangular faces, including the snub disphenoid as a deltahedron with all equilateral triangles.Dual of Snub Disphenoid (J84) However the dual of the snub disphenoid is not space-filling because the pentagons are not right-angled. === Related figures=== The elongated gyrobifastigium is the cell of the isochoric tridecachoron, a polychoron constructed from the dual of the 13-5 step prism, which has a snub disphenoid vertex figure. == Variations == A topologically distinct elongated gyrobifastigium has square and equilateral triangle faces, seen as 2 triangular prisms augmented to a central cube. This is a failed Johnson solid for not being strictly convex.Convex regular-faced polyhedra with conditional edges P3,2 This is also a space-filling polyhedron, and matches the geometry of the gyroelongated triangular prismatic honeycomb if the elongated gyrobifastigium are dissected back into cubes and triangular prisms. {| class=wikitable width=300 |- align=center |100px Coplanar square and triangles |} The elongated gyrobifastigium must be based on a rectangular cuboid or rhombohedron to fill-space, while the angle of the roof is free, including allowing concave forms. If the roof has zero angle, the geometry becomes a cube or rectangular cuboid. The pentagons can also be made regular and the rectangles become trapezoids, and it will no longer be space-filling. {| class=wikitable !Type||colspan=4|Space- filling||colspan=2|Not space-filling |- align=center valign=bottom !Image |80px Equilateral pentagons |100px Rhombic |100px Coplanar |100px Concave |120px Dual of snub disphenoid |100px Regular pentagons |- align=center !Net |130px |100px |100px |100px |110px |130px |} == Honeycomb == Like the gyrobifastigium, it can self-tessellate space. Polyhedra are tessellated by translation in the plane, and are stacked with alternate orientations. The cross section of the polyhedron must be square or rhombic, while the roof angle is free, and can be negative, making a concave polyhedron. Rhombic forms require chiral (mirror image) polyhedral pairs to be space-filling. {| class=wikitable |- align=center |150px Equilateral variation |150px Rhombic variation |240px Convex variation |200px Coplanar-faced variation |240px Concave variation |} == See also== *Elongated octahedron *Elongated dodecahedron *Elongated square bipyramid *Trapezo-rhombic dodecahedron ==References== == External links == * * Category:Space-filling polyhedra ",
