    "text": "Voodoo Violince is the first studio album by violinist Mark Wood, released in 1991 through Guitar Recordings. ==Critical reception== Roch Parisien at AllMusic gave Voodoo Violince three stars out of five, recommending it to open-minded fans of guitarists Joe Satriani and Steve Vai who might be looking for something different. He said that \"Wood's arsenal of custom-made electric violins (including a six- and nine-string double-neck, and a Flying V) sounds much like a Star Trek phaser set to overload and on the verge of exploding.\" Parisien went on to further describe Wood's tone, saying \"The high-pitched squeal can have an unearthly effect, full of feedback and vibrato but with the texture and range of a keyboard.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Mark Wood \u2013 violin, keyboard, piano, strings, production *Laura Kaye \u2013 vocals *George Green \u2013 vocals *Sylvestor Anthony Lewis III \u2013 vocals *Dave Lewitt \u2013 drums, percussion *Gerald Veasley \u2013 bass *Gregor Kitzis \u2013 strings *Denise Rude \u2013 strings *Liz Lim \u2013 strings *Eric Freelander \u2013 strings *Rozz Morehead \u2013 background vocals *Barbara Murray \u2013 background vocals *Suze Albright \u2013 background vocals *Lynette Washington \u2013 background vocals *Shawn Green \u2013 engineering *Paul Orofino \u2013 engineering, production *Tom Schizzano \u2013 engineering *John Stix \u2013 production ==References== Category:1991 debut albums ",
