    "text": "\"Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress\" (also titled \"Long Cool Woman\" or \"Long Cool Woman (in a Black Dress)\") is a song written by Allan Clarke, Roger Cook, and Roger Greenaway and performed by the British rock group The Hollies. Originally appearing on the album Distant Light, it was released as a single on 17 April 1972 (on Parlophone in the United Kingdom), selling 2 million copies worldwide, including 1.5 million in the United States. It reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in September 1972. Billboard ranked it as the No. 24 song for 1972. ==Background and recording== On the day \"Long Cool Woman\" was recorded at AIR Studios, the group's producer, Ron Richards, was ill and, as a result, the song was produced by the group. The song is different from most other Hollies songs in that there are no three-part vocal harmonies, and the song features lead guitar and lead vocal work by Allan Clarke. Upon his return, Ron Richards mixed the recording. The song was written in the swamp rock style of Creedence Clearwater Revival, in terms of the vocal, rhythm, and melodic style. It came out in the spring of 1972 (the same year Creedence split up). Clarke imitated John Fogerty's vocal style, which was based on the Creedence song \"Green River\". According to Clarke, the song was written \"in about five minutes\". However, Fogerty was not impressed. He filed a lawsuit against the Hollies for plagiarising his song \"Green River\". It was settled out of court with Fogerty receiving half of the proceeds for the song. ==Reception== In the Hollies' native United Kingdom, the song was only a modest success for the band, peaking at number 32 on the charts. However, it was a hit in the United States, peaking at number 2 for two weeks behind Gilbert O'Sullivan\u2019s \"Alone Again (Naturally)\". It was their highest charting single in that country. It also topped the charts in South Africa and peaked at number 2 in New Zealand and Australia. By this time, Clarke had already left the band, but he feels that \"it wasn't unfortunate\", since he had co- written the song. Clarke rejoined the Hollies in the summer of 1973, partly due to the success of this song. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Allan Clarke \u2013 vocals, lead guitar * Tony Hicks and Terry Sylvester \u2013 guitar * Bernie Calvert \u2013 bass * Bobby Elliott \u2013 drums ==Chart performance== ===Weekly singles charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1972) !Peak position |- |Australia | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |- |Canada (RPM 100 Singles) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |Netherlands (Gfk Top 100 Singles) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|21 |- |New Zealand (Listener) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|2 |- |South Africa (Springbok) |align=\"center\"|1 |- |UK (UK Singles Chart) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|32 |- |U.S. Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |- |U.S. Cash Box Top 100 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|1 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1972) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank |- |Australia | style=\"text-align:center;\"|16 |- |Canada | style=\"text-align:center;\"|19 |- |South Africa |align=\"center\"|10 |- |U.S. Billboard | style=\"text- align:center;\"|24 |- |U.S. Cash Box | style=\"text-align:center;\"|20 |} ==In popular culture and cover versions== *Phantom, Rocker & Slick released their version on their 1986 album Cover Girl. *Country music singer Clint Black released his version of the song to country radio on 19 February 2008, under the title \"Long Cool Woman\".
