After the renovation between 2010 and 2014, it was transformed into a new museum to house pieces of 19th and early-20th century art, which were mainly gathered from the palaces of Ottoman dynasty. ==Collection== The museum has more than 200 paintings displayed in 11 sections. Some of the displayed collections are listed below. ===Paintings by Turkish Artists (1870-1930) === This collection consists of works by Ottoman/Turkish artists such as \u015eeker Ahmed Pasha, Osman Hamdi Bey, H\u00fcseyin Zekai Pasha and Hodja Ali R\u0131za; which make up the second, third and fourth generation of the Turkish painting in Western sense. ===Paintings by Court Painters=== Works by artists such as Stanislaw Chlebowski and Fausto Zonaro, which respectively served to Abd\u00fclaziz I and Abd\u00fclhamid II as their court painters.

The paintings that were bought in this era reflect the taste of Sultan Abd\u00fclaziz and his assistant \u015eeker Ahmed Pasha. A Western style collection of paintings was brought together for the first time at the Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace during the reign of Sultan Abd\u00fclaziz. ===Paintings by Ivan Aivazovsky=== The Ceremony Hall, which is the most magnificent room of the structure with its stucco- lined walls and composite-headed plasters, is allocated to the Russian artist Aivazovsky. ===Paintings by Abd\u00fclmecid II=== The hall that exhibits this collection originally used to be the library of Abd\u00fclmecid II himself, who was born to become the last crown prince and caliph of the Ottoman dynasty. Interested in almost all branches of art, but particularly calligraphy and music, he remained a celebrated artist of Turkish painting. ===Orientalist Paintings=== The museum has a rich collection of works by 19th century Orientalist painters. ==References== ==See also== *Pera Museum *History of Modern Turkish painting *List of art museums Category:Art museums and galleries in Istanbul Category:Turkish art Category:Art museums established in 2014 Category:2014 establishments in Turkey ",
