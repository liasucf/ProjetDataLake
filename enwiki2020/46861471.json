    "text": "Bernard McCarthy (24 July 1874 \u2013 7 July 1948) was a New Zealand cricketer, lawyer and papal knight. ==Life and work== After attending St. Patrick's College, Wellington, McCarthy moved to H\u0101wera, where he qualified as a lawyer and in 1903 founded the law firm that is now known as Welsh McCarthy. McCarthy Street in H\u0101wera is named after him. He became president of the St. Patrick's College Old Boys' Association; for his work for the Old Boys and for organising the school's golden jubilee celebrations in 1935 he was awarded the papal knighthood of St Gregory the Great.Evening Post, 26 April 1935, p. 5. ==Cricket career== McCarthy played four matches for Taranaki during its brief period as a first-class cricket team. In Taranaki's only first-class victory, against Hawke's Bay in 1896\u201397, he took 3 for 42 and 4 for 46 with his off- spin. Hawke's Bay reversed the result in their next encounter in 1897\u201398, although McCarthy took his best figures of 5 for 109 and top-scored in each innings with 27 and 52, his best first-class score. Although Taranaki played no first-class matches after 1898, and McCarthy's cricket for four years was limited to minor matches, he was selected to play for New Zealand in two matches against Lord Hawke's XI in 1902\u201303. He took three wickets, all of opening batsmen.Don Neely & Richard Payne, Men in White: The History of New Zealand International Cricket, 1894\u20131985, Moa, Auckland, 1986, pp. 43-44. In the second match of the first season of the Hawke Cup in 1910\u201311, McCarthy took 6 for 12 and 4 for 29 as South Taranaki beat North Taranaki. He played his last Hawke Cup game in 1922\u201323. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1874 births Category:1948 deaths Category:New Zealand cricketers Category:Pre-1930 New Zealand representative cricketers Category:Taranaki cricketers Category:Knights of St. Gregory the Great Category:New Zealand lawyers Category:People educated at St. Patrick's College, Wellington Category:People from the West Coast, New Zealand ",
