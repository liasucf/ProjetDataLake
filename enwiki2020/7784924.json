    "text": "Mission San Pedro y San Pablo de Bicu\u00f1er was founded on January 7, 1781 by Spanish Padre Francisco Garc\u00e9s, to protect the Anza Trail where it forded the Colorado River, between colonial Mexico and Alta California. The settlement, located about northeast of Yuma Crossing in present-day California, was not part of the Spanish California missions chain, but was administered as a part of the Arizona missions chain. ==History== The Mission site and nearby pueblo were inadequately supported, and Spanish colonists seized the best lands, destroyed the Indians' crops, and generally ignored the rights of the local natives. R. Douglas Hurt, 2002, The Indian frontier, 1763-1846, UNM Press, . Google Books excerpt In retaliation, the Quechans (Yuma) and their allies attacked and destroyed the installation and the neighboring Mission Puerto de Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n during a three-day period, from July 17-19, 1781. Some 50 Spaniards, including Father Garc\u00e9s (along with three other friars and Captain Fernando Rivera y Moncada) were killed, and the women and children taken captive. The Indians' victory closed this crossing and seriously crippled future communications between Las Californias province and colonial Mexico, both within the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Today, only a California Historical Marker identifies the site. The marker is located on Imperial County Road S24, 0.2 mi W of the intersection of Levee Road and Mehring Road/11th St, and 4.4 mi NE of Bard, in southeastern Imperial County. ==See also== * Spanish missions in Arizona * ==References== ==External links== * Missions of the Colorado River * Discovery of California * Virtual Tour of California Missions * California State Landmark number 921 plaque San Pedro y San Pablo de Bicu San Pedro y San Pablo de Bicu Category:California Historical Landmarks Category:Pre-statehood history of Arizona Category:1781 establishments in New Spain Category:1781 establishments in California Category:National Register of Historic Places in Imperial County, California Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in California ",
