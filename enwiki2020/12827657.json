    "text": "Ho Yi also known as Ho Yi Wong (\u9ec3\u6d69\u7fa9) (pinyin Hu\u00e1ng H\u00e0o Y\u00ec; born 1956) is a Chinese actor, director, playwright and producer of Hong Kong origin. He has lived and worked in the United Kingdom. == Early life == Ho Yi was born educated in Hong Kong. His development as an actor/director coincided with the boom of the Hong Kong \"City Hall Culture\", a \"renaissance\" period of the former Urban Council, Hong Kong. == Professional early years == Ho Yi\u2019s professional acting career began when the Hong Kong Repertory Theatre (\u9999\u6e2f\u8a71\u5287\u5718), a government subsidized company prepared itself to establish in 1977, Ho Yi became one of its earliest freelance actors. His first full-time acting job was with the government run Radio Television Hong Kong (\u9999\u6e2f\u96fb\u53f0) where he worked for three years. == Career in Hong Kong == In 1983, Ho Yi founded Spotlight Productions (\u6d69\u91c7\u88fd\u4f5c) in Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Youth Theatre Company (\u9999\u6e2f\u9752\u5e74\u5287\u5718), mainly to do theatrical stage work. Between 1983 and 1997, with his two independent theatre companies, he wrote/translated, produced, directed and starred in a score of stage productions, including two musicals \u2013 of which his Pa Pa Can You Hear Me Sing (\u642d\u932f\u8eca) was with the collaboration of the late David Toguri (Rocky Horror Picture Show and Who Framed Roger Rabbit) as his choreographer. He also worked with the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra in three seasons. His signature play American Buffalo (\u52fe\u5fc3\u9b25\u89d2), first staged in 1986, became known as a theatrical milestone of Hong Kong as written up by \"Film Bi-weekly\" (\u96fb\u5f71\u96d9\u5468). Ho Yi\u2019s unique and original treatment in the delivery of the rich David Mamet dialogue in Cantonese (Cantonese is now officially recognised as a language) created a new form of acting style known as Wu Li Tou (\u7121\u91cc\u982d) for the Hong Kong stage. Ho Yi\u2019s career as a cross-genre actor, on both stage and screen, extended further afield in the early 1990s. As early as 1992, he produced, directed and acted in China. The following year he broke new grounds in Shanghai, by staging the American play Extremities (\u4ee5\u7259\u9084\u7259) in Mandarin. He made his English-language acting debut in British television series Soldier, Soldier while still in Hong Kong, followed by a principal role in the film Victory (Wang) directed by Oscar-winner Mark Peploe (co- screenwriter of the Last Emperor), starring opposite Hollywood heavyweights Willem Dafoe and Sam Neill, in 1994. == Film Making in Hong Kong == Ho Yi made his feature film directing debut with Thunderstorm (\u96f7\u96e8), for which he also wrote the screenplay and played the leading role, in 1995. Red Passage (\"\u7d05\u8272\u7684\u8ff4\u5eca\")is Ho Yi's second narrative feature film as a director for which he wrote the screenplay in 2005. It took eight years before shooting began in July 2013. Red Passage is also produced by Ho Yi. It is based on his own story set in 1970/71 and filmed entirely in Hong Kong, in Cantonese. Red Passage had its world premiere at Palm Beach International Film Festival, on 6 April 2014. According to Tim Wassberg's review for Sirk TV of Inside Reel, the film \"shows the intersection of both plot and emotion on a human scale [...] this movie from the perspective of the life of one who experienced it can be so compelling [...] It shows the conflict but also, within the character, his revelation.\"http://www.sirktv.com/2014/05/05/red-passage-review-pbiff-2014/, Sirk TV in Inside Reel On 13 September 2014, Red Passage was screened at the Awareness Film Festival in Los Angeles, where it won a Jury Award. On the same day, in the United States, Red Passage was also screened at the Reel Hope Film Festival in Indianapolis. On 24 October 2014, Red Passage premiered in Hong Kong, at the Hong Kong Asian Film Festival. In May 2015, Red Passage was selected by the Garifuna International Film Festival. The film was awarded a \"Best Foreign Language Film Award\" as well as an appreciation certificate from the City of Los Angeles for \"tremendous dedication to the preservation of indigenous culture bringing awareness through films\" to Ho Yi personally. == United Kingdom Works== After arriving in the United Kingdom, Ho Yi has appeared opposite Brad Pitt in Spy Game (Prison Warden)https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266987/, Spy Game in IMDb and Pierce Brosnan in the Bond movie Die Another Dayhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246460/, Die Another Day in IMDb (Mr. Chang).

In May 2000, Ho Yi appeared, for an entire first run term, in a London\u2019s West End production of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The King & I, with Elaine Paige. British critic Sheridan Morley reviewed in The Spectator and the British Teletext describing Ho Yi as the \"Male Star of the Night\" for his opening night\u2019s performance of The Kralahome. == Works in Shanghai, China == Upon arrival in Shanghai, he appeared in Chinese film Clay fear (\u9676\u5668\u4eba\u5f62). For the stage, he directed An Inspector Calls (\u7591\u96f2\u9663\u9663), A Doll\u2019s House (\"\u73a9\u5076\u4e4b\u5bb6\"\uff0c\u53c8\u540d \"\u5080\u5121\u5bb6\u5ead\"), Agent Penny and A Woman\u2019s Monologue of the Classics (\u7d93\u5178\u6232\u5287\u5973\u7368\u767d) in Shanghai.

In summer 2009, Ho Yi published his 32-episode television screenplay Zhou Xinfang (\u5468\u4fe1\u82b3\u50b3\u5947\u4e4b\"\u6232\u5b50\u4f73\u4eba\") in Hong Kong. ==Personal life== Ho Yi is married to Vivian Chow (daughter of Peking opera actor Zhou Xinfang), with whom he has one son, Dashiell Edmund Wong. ==Major acting credits== ===Theatre=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
