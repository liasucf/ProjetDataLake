Competing for Russia he won the 2007 world title, the 2008 World Cup, and two European titles, in 2006 and 2010. After failing to qualify for the 2012 Olympics he moved to Azerbaijan and placed second at the 2015 World Championships and fifth at the 2016 Summer Olympics. ==Career== At the 2006 European Championships he beat Stephen Smith in the semis and Shahin Imranov 28:10 in the final.
