    "text": "In mathematics, uniformly convex spaces (or uniformly rotund spaces) are common examples of reflexive Banach spaces. The concept of uniform convexity was first introduced by James A. Clarkson in 1936. == Definition == A uniformly convex space is a normed vector space such that, for every 0<\\varepsilon \\leq 2 there is some \\delta>0 such that for any two vectors with \\|x\\| = 1 and \\|y\\| = 1, the condition :\\|x-y\\|\\geq\\varepsilon implies that: :\\left\\|\\frac{x+y}{2}\\right\\|\\leq 1-\\delta. Intuitively, the center of a line segment inside the unit ball must lie deep inside the unit ball unless the segment is short. == Properties == * The unit sphere can be replaced with the closed unit ball in the definition. Namely, a normed vector space X is uniformly convex if and only if for every 0<\\varepsilon\\le 2 there is some \\delta>0 so that, for any two vectors x and y in the closed unit ball (i.e. \\|x\\| \\le 1 and \\|y\\| \\le 1 ) with \\|x-y\\| \\ge \\varepsilon , one has \\left\\|{\\frac{x+y}{2}}\\right\\| \\le 1-\\delta (note that, given \\varepsilon , the corresponding value of \\delta could be smaller than the one provided by the original weaker definition). The \"if\" part is trivial. Conversely, assume now that X is uniformly convex and that x,y are as in the statement, for some fixed 0<\\varepsilon\\le 2 . Let \\delta_1\\le 1 be the value of \\delta corresponding to \\frac{\\varepsilon}{3} in the definition of uniform convexity. We will show that \\left\\|\\frac{x+y}{2}\\right\\|\\le 1-\\delta , with \\delta=\\min\\left\\\\{\\frac{\\varepsilon}{6},\\frac{\\delta_1}{3}\\right\\\\} . If \\|x\\|\\le 1-2\\delta then \\left\\|\\frac{x+y}{2}\\right\\|\\le\\frac{1}{2}(1-2\\delta)+\\frac{1}{2}=1-\\delta and the claim is proved. A similar argument applies for the case \\|y\\|\\le 1-2\\delta , so we can assume that 1-2\\delta<\\|x\\|,\\|y\\|\\le 1 . In this case, since \\delta\\le\\frac{1}{3} , both vectors are nonzero, so we can let x'=\\frac{x}{\\|x\\|} and y'=\\frac{y}{\\|y\\|} . We have \\|x'-x\\|=1-\\|x\\|\\le 2\\delta and similarly \\|y'-y\\|\\le 2\\delta , so x' and y' belong to the unit sphere and have distance \\|x'-y'\\|\\ge\\|x-y\\|-4\\delta\\ge\\varepsilon-\\frac{4\\varepsilon}{6}=\\frac{\\varepsilon}{3} . Hence, by our choice of \\delta_1 , we have \\left\\|\\frac{x'+y'}{2}\\right\\|\\le 1-\\delta_1 . It follows that \\left\\|\\frac{x+y}{2}\\right\\|\\le\\left\\|\\frac{x'+y'}{2}\\right\\|+\\frac{\\|x'-x\\|+\\|y'-y\\|}{2}\\le 1-\\delta_1+2\\delta\\le 1-\\frac{\\delta_1}{3}\\le 1-\\delta and the claim is proved. * The Milman\u2013Pettis theorem states that every uniformly convex Banach space is reflexive, while the converse is not true. * Every uniformly convex Banach space is a Radon-Riesz space, that is, if \\\\{f_n\\\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty} is a sequence in a uniformly convex Banach space which converges weakly to f and satisfies \\|f_n\\| \\to \\|f\\|, then f_n converges strongly to f , that is, \\|f_n - f\\| \\to 0 . * A Banach space X is uniformly convex if and only if its dual X^* is uniformly smooth. * Every uniformly convex space is strictly convex. Intuitively, the strict convexity means a stronger triangle inequality \\|x+y\\| < \\|x\\|+\\|y\\| whenever x,y are linearly independent, while the uniform convexity requires this inequality to be true uniformly. == Examples == * Every Hilbert space is uniformly convex. * Every closed subspace of a uniformly convex Banach space is uniformly convex. * Hanner's inequalities imply that Lp spaces (1 are uniformly convex. * Conversely, L^\\infty is not uniformly convex. ==See also== * Modulus and characteristic of convexity * Uniformly convex function * Uniformly smooth space == References == * . * . * * * Lindenstrauss, Joram and Benyamini, Yoav.
