    "text": "The Wilson-Pittman-Campbell-Gregory House is a historic house at 405 East Dickson Street in Fayetteville, Arkansas. It is a two-story brick structure, with a late 19th-century two-story kitchen addition to the rear, and a modern single-story ell. Its current west-facing front dates stylistically to the 1870s, with Italianate brackets, engaged posts, and balustrade, but is a 1930s reconstruction of the original. Prominent local owners of the building include James Pittman, a Civil War colonel, Benjamin F. Campbell, a businessman, and James Gregory, a local politician. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Italianate architecture in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1866 Category:Houses in Fayetteville, Arkansas Category:1866 establishments in Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Fayetteville, Arkansas ",
