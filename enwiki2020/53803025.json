Benfica competed domestically in the Primeira Divis\u00e3o and the Ta\u00e7a de Portugal, and participated in the European Cup Winners' Cup after being runners-up in the 1974 Ta\u00e7a de Portugal Final. After failing to retain the title in the past season, manager Fernando Cabrita was replaced by Milorad Pavi\u0107. With almost no signings in the transfer market, Benfica biggest departures were Rui Rodrigues and Zeca. After a lengthy pre-season, Benfica started their campaign with two victories against Belenenses and Farense. They dropped points in the third week, before winning the following two matches, reaching first place. In October, they drew with Boavista and lost at home to Porto, falling to third place. Four consecutive wins followed, until three draws in December cost them first place. Benfica lapped the first part of the season with a three-point deficit to Porto, but managed recover that in January. A draw in early February, with Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra stopped them, but the team reacted with five consecutive wins, opening a five-point lead by mid March. Benfica was then knocked out of the Cup Winners' Cup by PSV Eindhoven and lost for the league with Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal, cutting their advantage to three-points. Nonetheless, in early May, Benfica confirmed their 21st league title, their 12th since 1960. ==Season summary== Benfica started the new season trying to recover the title lost to Sporting in the past season. Fernando Cabrita was replaced by Milorad Pavi\u0107, who was the second choice to Miljan Miljani\u0107. Miljani\u0107 initially agreed with the club, but in March 1973, he back-tracked on his word, so he could sign with Real Madrid. Pavi\u0107, the former teacher of Miljani\u0107, signed a 2-year deal on 22 April. Three days later, the Carnation Revolution changed the course of the country. In the transfer market, Benfica made almost no new signings but also only had three departures, Rui Rodrigues and Zeca, being the more noteworthy. The pre-season began on 19 July, with Pavi\u0107 arriving to Portugal later in the same day. The first training sessions were in Serra da Estrela, before the club embarked on a tour in Mexico and United States in early August. Afterwards, they competed in the Trofeo Ciudad de Sevilla and the Independence Cup in Brazil. Benfica started their league campaign with victories against Belenenses and Farense, reaching top of the table, ex aequo with Porto. On match-day 3, they dropped their first points, in a home draw with Olhanense. They reacted by winning their following two league matches, while also easily progressing in the Cup Winners' Cup. On 13 October, Benfica visited Est\u00e1dio do Bessa to play Boavista and drew 0\u20130. That resulted in them being caught in first place by Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es and Porto. A week later, Benfica lost at home with Porto by 1\u20130 and dropped to third place, two points shy of leaders Porto and Guimar\u00e3es. They reacted positively to the loss and won their next four Primeira Divis\u00e3o matches, retaking first place albeit shared with Porto. Both had 18 points. In Europe, Benfica qualified for the quarter-finals, after eliminating Carl Zeiss Jena in the second round. Off the field, Benfica lost Eus\u00e9bio to injury, as he underwent his six operation to his left knee. On match-day 12, Benfica drew 0\u20130 with Oriental and dropped to second, a point from leaders Porto. In the final three matches of December, Benfica won the first but drew the others. First with Sporting on the 22, for the Derby de Lisboa, and then on the 29, with Uni\u00e3o de Tomar. Benfica lapped the first half of the season in second place with three points less than leaders Porto. In January, Benfica won their opening match, while Porto lost theirs, reducing the gap between them to a point. Two weeks later, Benfica defeated Olhanense on the road and Porto lost in Alvalade, with the teams exchanging places. Benfica now led by a point over Porto. In the last match of the month, Benfica defeated Leix\u00f5es at home, and Porto lost again, which increased Benfica's advantage to three-points, 31 to 28. However, a draw with Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra on 2 February, cut that lead to two points. In mid February, Benfica visited Est\u00e1dio das Antas for the Cl\u00e1ssico, defeating Porto by 3\u20130. Benfica had now a three-point lead over Sporting, who overtook Porto for second place. The team continued on their winning run, and on match-day 25, they added two more points in their difference over Sporting, which had lost in Bessa. However, Benfica would experienced a troubled third week of March. First they were knocked-out of the European Cup Winners' Cup by PSV Eindhoven at home. President Borges Coutinho attributed the defeat to a friendly of the national team, 9 days earlier in Goi\u00e2nia; which negatively affected the Benfica players used. He called it \"completely useless\". On 23 March, Benfica lost with Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal and saw his lead over Sporting reduced to three-points. They reacted with two consecutive wins, before meeting Sporting in Est\u00e1dio de Alvalade on 4 May. Only needing a draw to win the title, they drew 1\u20131 and celebrated their 21st league title. It was their 12th in the past 16 seasons, and the 21st in the 41 editions of the Primeira Divis\u00e3o. Three weeks into May, Pavi\u0107 announced his departure, with Benfica signing M\u00e1rio Wilson as his replacement. Before the season ended, Pavi\u0107 qualified Benfica for the Ta\u00e7a de Portugal Final, where they would play Boavista. They lost 2\u20131 with the goal from former Benfica youth player, Jo\u00e3o Alves being decisive. Captain Toni said: \"We wanted to offer this Cup to Pavi\u0107. More than everyone else, he deserved it because of what he had done throughout the season...\". ==Competitions== ===Overall record=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"| Competition !rowspan=\"2\"| First match !rowspan=\"2\"| Last match !colspan=\"9\"| Record |- !G !W !D !L !GF !GA !GD !Win % !Source |- | align=left| Primeira Divis\u00e3o | align=left| 11 September 1974 | align=left| 11 May 1975 | align=left| |- | align=left| Ta\u00e7a de Portugal | align=left| 5 April 1975 | align=left| 14 June 1975 | align=left| |- | align=left| European Cup Winners' Cup | align=left| 18 September 1974 | align=left| 19 March 1975 | align=left| |- ! colspan=\"3\"| Total |} ===Primeira Divis\u00e3o=== ====League table==== ====Results by round==== ====Matches==== ===Ta\u00e7a de Portugal=== ===European Cup Winners' Cup=== ====First round==== ====Second round==== ====Quarter- final==== ===Friendlies=== ==Player statistics== The squad for the season consisted of the players listed in the tables below, as well as staff member Milorad Pavi\u0107 (manager), Fernando Cabrita (assistant manager), Fernando Neves (Director of Football). ==Transfers== ===In=== {| class=\"wikitable unsortable\" |- !
