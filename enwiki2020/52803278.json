Edwards has received many awards and honors for her research and public service related to families and literacy. == Education == Edwards grew up in Albany, Georgia and graduated from Albany State College (Albany, Georgia) with a B.S. in Elementary Education in 1970. In 1971, Edwards received a M.S. in Elementary Education from North Carolina A & T University (Greensboro, North Carolina). She received an Ed.S. from Duke University in Reading Education in 1976 and a Ph.D. in Reading Education with a minor concentration in Educational Administration from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison in 1979.University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Education.

Retrieved from http://utdr.utoledo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1527&context;=ut-press- releases coordinating the Pre-Student Teaching Program while simultaneously teaching in public schools in Durham, Raleigh, and Chapel Hill. During this time, she explored how to teach in and how to help pre-service teachers learn to teach in a variety of organizational structures (e.g. team-teaching, self- contained classrooms, non-graded classrooms, open classrooms, etc.), in addition to exploring these structures' impact on parents and children. === Louisiana === Upon completion of her Ph.D., Edwards worked at Grambling State University followed by Louisiana Tech University. While at Louisiana Tech, she received a W. K. Kellogg National Fellowship in 1983.Kellogg Fellowship Leadership Alliance. (2013). https://search.kfla.org/PublicProfile?contactid=0037000000VA2C1AAL\u27e8=en The program's goal was to support participants' intellectual and leadership development.Kellogg Fellowship Leadership Alliance. (2013). Frequently asked questions. Retrieved from https://www.kfla.org/en/faq#history As part of the Fellowship, Edwards focused her learning on family involvement in education. She visited many agencies and institutions of higher education throughout the United States and abroad meeting with noted experts in order to explore this topic from a variety of perspectives. Edwards also volunteered as a parent consultant at a local Head Start center in a small rural northern Louisiana community to investigate how to support parents' efforts to foster their children's educational development.Edwards, P.A. & Panofsky, C.P. (1989). The effect of two training procedures on the book reading of lower-SES mothers and children. National Reading Conference Yearbook, 138, 135-143. Edwards continued this research in her next job at Louisiana State University. During this time, she developed many of the ideas that would become her program Parents as Partners in Reading: A Family Literacy Training Program (1990, 1993) by working with parents and teachers at Donaldsonville Elementary School located in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, a small rural southern community. The program's goal was to train parents in effective book-reading practices desired by the school. This led to the second program Edwards developed, Talking Your Way to Literacy: A Program to Help Nonreading Parents Prepare Their Children for Reading (1990). These programs were implemented in schools and libraries; Early Reading First grants, Even Start, Head Start, and Title I programs; and in teenage parent and family centers across the nation. For this work, Edwards received commendations from former Louisiana Congressman Clyde Holloway and the national press\u2014e.g. The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, New York Times, and the Milwaukee Journal. Former First Lady Barbara Bush included Edwards's Parents as Partners in Reading program as one of ten promising family literacy programs nationwide in her book First Teachers. In October 1988, Edwards and her Parents as Partners in Reading program were featured in a nationally televised documentary hosted by Phylicia Rashad, \"First Things First\" sponsored by Project Literacy U.S. and ABC/WQED Productions. In October 1989, Edwards was highlighted on Dan Rather's Nightly News Series \"The Best of Us\" as one of five Americans everyone should know. For Edwards's work with families and children, she received honors from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison: Outstanding African American Alumni Award (1991) and the School of Education Alumni Achievement Award (1995). === Illinois === Resulting from Edwards's family literacy work in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, she was invited to the Center for the Study of Reading at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign during the 1988\u201389 school year. There, she continued her investigation into successful approaches for communicating with diverse family populations and transferred her knowledge about families and book reading from her initial research in a rural setting to an urban setting. This work further contributed to her Parents as Partners in Reading and her Talking Your Way to Literacy programs. === Michigan === In the fall of 1989, following her year at the Center for the Study of Reading, Edwards came to Michigan State University. In 1990, Edwards was appointed by U.S. Assistant Secretary John McDonald as an adviser to the First National Goal Readiness for School and was appointed to the Michigan State University Institute for Families, Youth and Children. In 1994, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) invited Edwards to the first World Symposium on Family Literacy in Paris, France as one of fifty researchers asked to participate in developing a world policy on family literacy and to share current and past research initiatives. At Michigan State University, Edwards, now a Distinguished Professor, continues to investigate ways to involve and support families in their children's literacy development. For example, she worked with a professional development school in Lansing, Michigan coordinating the Home Literacy ProjectThompson, S. (1991, April 2).

In 2008, Edwards became a Senior University Outreach Fellow at Michigan State University for her service to educators throughout the state of Michigan. == Major topics of research == Throughout her career, Edwards has advocated for explicit teaching\u2014i.e. giving students, parents, and teachers the exact information and procedures needed for successLazar, A.

She has focused her efforts on increasing family literacy and involvement, helping others better understand and capitalize on African American and other minority students' literacy resources, understanding what literacy looks like internationally, and preparing literacy teachers to work with diverse students and families. === Parent involvement, home-school-community partnerships, and family literacy === In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Edwards researched what families understood by the request to \"read to their child.\" This led to the development of her family literacy programs Parents as Partners in Reading: A Family Literacy Training Program and Talking Your Way to Literacy: A Program to Help Nonreading Parents Prepare Their Children for Reading which gave parents, and people working with parents, specific strategies to help parents support their children's school learning. Edwards conducted follow-up research to determine how local parent leaders took up and continued the practices from the Parents as Partners program.Edwards, P.A. (1995). Empowering low-income mothers and fathers to share books with young children. The Reading Teacher, 48(7), 558-564. Through Edwards's continued work with families, she has found that bridging the divide between families and schools requires support from all community members/organizations and that it requires recognizing families' diverse strengths and needs/desires.Edwards, P.A. (1992). Involving parents in building reading instruction for African-American children. Theory Into Practice, 31(4), 350-359.Edwards, P.A. & Jones Young, L.S. (1992). Beyond parents: Family, community, and school involvement. Phi Delta Kappan, 74(1), 72-80. It requires listening to parent stories about their children, i.e. seeing parents as experts,Edwards, P.A. & Pleasants, H. M. (1997). Uncloseting home literacy environments: Issues raised through the telling of parent stories. Early Child Development and Care, 127(1), 27-46, https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0300443971270104Edwards, P. A. with Pleasants, H. M., & Franklin, S. H. (1999). A path to follow: Learning to listen to parents. Westport, CT: Heinemann. and getting to know the demographics and the people of the community the school serves.Edwards, P. A. (2016). New ways to engage parents: Strategies and tools for teachers and leaders, K-12. New York: Teachers College Press. Based on her work, she coined the terms differentiated parenting and parentally appropriate.Edwards, P. A. (2009). Tapping the potential of parents: A strategic guide to boosting student achievement through family involvement. New York: Scholastic Inc. She proposed the concept of differentiated parenting to urge schools not to place all parents into one basket. When schools design programs for parents, one size does not fit all; instead, schools must adapt to fit parents' needs. As schools think about their activities and ways of engaging parents, these avenues must be parentally appropriate in order to make tasks compatible with parents' various capabilities in supporting their children in particular ways as requested by the school. === Literacy in multicultural contexts === Edwards's work advocates for schools to recognize, learn about, and value students' varied home literacies and cultural practices\u2014such as literacies used in African American church services or encouraging students to bring in their own cultural artifacts as an adaptation of sharing time for emergent bilinguals.Protacio, M.S. & Edwards, P.A. (2015). Restructuring sharing time for English learners and their parents. The Reading Teacher, 68(6), 413-421. In the book Bridging Literacy and Equity: The Essential Guide to Social Equity Teaching, Althier Lazar, Patricia Edwards, and Gwendolyn McMillon challenge teachers and schools to abandon deficit ways of thinking and instead embrace culturally responsive practices and social equity teaching by recognizing the diverse resources their students bring, which are likely different from those with which their teachers grew up, and by advocating for their students.

Retrieved from http://www.literacyresearchassociation.org/award--edward-b--fry-book-award Edwards and co-authors Gwendolyn McMillon and Jennifer Turner address historical supports and roadblocks for African Americans to obtain education and literacy skills. They also provide solutions that connect research, theory, pedagogy, and history to help teachers support their students' literacy development. These solutions include mentoring students, collaborating with community and faith-based organizations, establishing strong school leadership, helping students take ownership of literacy and see it as critical to their lives, and forging positive home-school connections. === Literacy in international contexts === Edwards has long been interested in the question \"How does the world read?\"Edwards, P.A. (2010, August/September). How does the world read? Reading Today, 28(1), 22-23. As Vice President of the International Literacy Association (ILA) (formerly International Reading Association), she developed a survey and databank of global literacy practices and ways in which teacher educators worldwide prepare their teachers to teach reading. With assistance from the Director of International Development, councils and national affiliates of the International Literacy Association were asked to share publications and reports about their country's state of education with particular emphasis on literacy development and achievement. They were also asked to share photographs that captured home and school environments as well as artifacts exemplifying literacy materials in their countries. Lastly, they were asked to gather other materials such as stories or audio/video clips of administrators, teachers, parents, and students talking about literacy and how it is used and taught in their countries. As ILA President-Elect and President, as well as through the organization People to People, Edwards has led educators and ILA delegates on trips to China,Edwards, P.A. & Piazza, S. (2010, April/May).

She has found that understanding international literacy practices is especially important for cross-cultural communication and for preparing United States teachers for increasingly diverse classrooms.Michigan State University College of Education. (2008, Spring). Edwards elected vice president of International Reading Association. New Educator, 13(2), 41. Retrieved from http://education.msu.edu/neweducator/Spring08/NewEdspring08.pdf === Teacher education and preparation === Through Edwards's work related to family involvement and literacy in multicultural and international contexts, she has found that teachers often lack preparation in how to respond to and meet the needs of diverse groups of students and their families.Turner, J.D., & Edwards, P. A. (2009). Old tensions, new visions: Implications for teacher education programs, K- 12 schools, and family literacy programs. In G. Li (Ed.), Multicultural families, home literacies, and mainstream schooling (pp. 246-268). Charlotte, NC: Information Age Publishing. Therefore, many of her books are written for teachers. Her books New Ways to Engage Parents: Strategies and Tools for Teachers and Leaders, K\u201312, Tapping the Potential of Parents: A Strategic Guide to Boosting Student Achievement Through Family Involvement, and A Path to Follow: Learning to Listen to Parents provide concrete steps to aid teachers in their work with families such as gathering information about families and listening to their stories, promoting a variety of avenues for communication and involvement, and working with community organizations.
