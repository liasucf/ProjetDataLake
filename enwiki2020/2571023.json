    "text": "Grafarvogur () is among the largest residential districts of Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland. It is a relatively new neighbourhood, major construction began in the late 1980s and continued well into the 1990s. ==Neighbourhoods== The district includes 14 neighbourhoods: Hamrar, Foldir, H\u00fas, Rimar, Borgir, V\u00edkur, Engi, Sp\u00f6ng, Sta\u00f0ir, H\u00f6f\u00f0ar, Bryggjuhverfi, Geirsnef, Gufunes, Geldinganes. Of those, five (Rimar, Hamrar, Borgir, V\u00edkur and Foldir) fall within the boundaries of historic Gufunes estate. ==Shopping== Grafarvogur currently has one medium-sized shopping centre called Sp\u00f6ngin. It's not a mall in itself but a cluster of stores, Hagkaup being the largest. Also, there are small clusters of stores in Hverafold, by V\u00edkurvegur and Langirimi Streets. Those are much smaller and contain only a few stores, the supermarkets being the largest of the few. ==References== Grafarvogur, the district and the name giving bay ==External links== * Official website * Government website Category:Districts of Reykjav\u00edk ",
