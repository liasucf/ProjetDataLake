He denied rumors of any rift between the members, explaining that the band had been supportive of the decision. ===2015\u20132017: Mind of Mine=== In March 2015, Malik was seen at a London recording studio with producer Naughty Boy. Following his departure from One Direction, Malik alluded to the potential of a solo career, with the release of his first solo studio album to be released under the Syco label in 2016.

Later that year, Malik gave several interviews where he talked about his debut solo studio album and revealed part of the track list. Talking with The Fader, he stated \"life experiences have been the influences for the album and just stuff that I've been through, especially in the last five years\". In a conversation with Billboard, Malik's main collaborator for the album James \"Malay\" Ho said they have gone to unusual lengths in pursuit of inspiration during recording sessions, for one \"we went camping for a week in the Angeles Forest \u2013 set up a generator and a tent so we could track in the woods.\" In his first solo on- camera interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music's Beats 1, Malik revealed Mind of Mine as the album's title.

Primarily R&B; and alternative R&B;, the album blends elements from a number of genres. Despite the variations in the sounds and genres, Mind of Mine is structured in an \"album-as-complete-work\" form, maintaining a tightly knit cohesion throughout the record, with an almost seamless transition between and across songs, while maintaining a recognizable, mostly downbeat, \"hazy\" tone throughout. This gives the album a continuous flow, and gives the impression that it all came from one person's \"mind.\" It has received generally positive reviews, with praise for Malik's new musical direction, his vocals, and the music production. Mind of Mine debuted at number one in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and United States, where he became the first British male solo artist to debut at number one with his first album.
