Her research specialties include complex geometry, Fuchsian groups, Riemann surfaces, and abelian varieties. ==Education== Rodr\u00edguez earned a master's degree in mathematics at the in 1975. She completed her Ph.D. in 1981 at Columbia University; her dissertation, On Schottky-Type Groups with Applications to Riemann Surfaces with Nodes, was supervised by Lipman Bers. ==Career== Rodr\u00edguez worked for the University of Santiago, Chile, but was dismissed in 1985, during the regime of Augusto Pinochet, for unstated but likely-political reasons. After many colleagues appealed the decision, she was hired by the Federico Santa Mar\u00eda Technical University. She was president of the Chilean Mathematical Society from 2006 to 2010. ==Books== Rodr\u00edguez is the co-author of the book Complex Analysis: In the Spirit of Lipman Bers (Graduate Texts in Mathematics, 2007, 2nd ed., 2013, with Irwin Kra and Jane Piore Gilman). She is the co-editor of Lipman Bers, a Life in Mathematics (American Mathematical Society, 2015, with Linda Keen and Irwin Kra). ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Columbia University alumni Category:University of La Frontera Category:Chilean mathematicians Category:Women mathematicians ",
