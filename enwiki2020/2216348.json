They were formed and mentored by New York rapper, The Notorious B.I.G.. In 1995, they released their debut album, Conspiracy. The success of the group's singles, \"Player's Anthem\" (US #13) and \"Get Money\" (US #17), helped launch the career of Lil' Kim as a solo artist. The group disbanded shortly after the murder of The Notorious B.I.G., with Lil' Kim and Lil' Cease continuing on with their solo careers. In 2005, three of the members (not including Lil\u2019 Kim) released a second album under the Junior M.A.F.I.A. name. ==Formation== The members of Junior M.A.F.I.A. met as childhood friends of The Notorious B.I.G..
