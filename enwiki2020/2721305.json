He also co-wrote their second single, \"Holiday in Cambodia\", in conjunction with the rest of the group, and \"Pull My Strings\", a song written with lead singer and primary songwriter Jello Biafra specifically for the 1980 Bay Area Music awards. He also played on the Dead Kennedys track \"Night of the Living Rednecks\", in which Dead Kennedys guitarist East Bay Ray's guitar \"breaks\" and the band begins playing in a bebop style, while Biafra tells about his encounter with some jocks. He preferred Gretsch drum kits and was best known for his manic energy and his distinctive kick-snare-ride patterns.
