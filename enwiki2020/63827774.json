The southern end point of the W\u00fcrttemberger Wine Route is the Kressbronn wine growing exclave on Lake Constance. The 511-kilometre-long tourist road begins in the north in Weikersheim and leads through the W\u00fcrttemberg wine-growing regions on the banks of the Tauber, Kocher rivers, Jagst, Neckar, Sulm, Lein, Zaber, Schozach, Bottwar and Rems to the seven-press town of Metzingen in the south. An exclave of the W\u00fcrttemberger Weinstrasse is Kressbronn on Lake Constance, where W\u00fcrttemberger wines are cultivated beyond the state border as far as Lindau. The route leads through all W\u00fcrttemberg wine regions and passes many sights. On October 13, 2004 the new wine route was officially inaugurated in Tripsdrill. The W\u00fcrttemberger Weinstra\u00dfe is the successor of the previous Swabian Wine Route, but with a revised route. In the east the \"Remstal-Route\" has been integrated. On April 12, 2007, the route was extended a little bit: It now leads from Stuttgart-M\u00fcnster directly to Stuttgart city centre and then back to Bad Cannstatt. == Course == The Course - click to zoom (Info of the regional council Stuttgart from April 1, 2004) * Start: Start in Oberstetten at Niederstetten to Weikersheim Castle from there on the country road 2251 to Markelsheim - Igersheim * from Igersheim on the Bundesstra\u00dfe 19 via Bad Mergentheim - Stuppach - D\u00f6rzbach - Stachenhausen to Ingelfingen;

Schw\u00e4bische Weinstra\u00dfe) was a holiday route in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. It led through many wine villages in wine-growing area W\u00fcrttemberg. It was inaugurated on 14 September 1993. It was followed in 1996 by a 320-kilometre- long cycle path and a branched network of hiking trails with a total length of 420 kilometres. On October 13, 2004, the Swabian Wine Route was replaced by the newly created W\u00fcrttemberg Wine Route with an extended route. == See also == * Viniculture in Stuttgart == Web links == * W\u00fcrttemberger Weinstra\u00dfe * W\u00fcrttemberg Winegrowers' Association Category:Wine regions of Germany ",
