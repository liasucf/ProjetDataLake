    "text": "Stereo typ (English: Stereotype) is a studio album by Polish singer Kayah, released in 2003. == Background == Kayah wrote all the lyrics, except \"Do It Right\", written by Mika Urbaniak, and \"Testosteron\", co-written with Krzysztof Pszona. The title expresses Kayah's attitude against her stereotypes as an artist and as a woman. Musically, the album explores various genres: neo soul on \"Wi\u0119kszy apetyt\" and \"Teren zaminowany\", 70s funk (\"Jeszcze ta noc\") and elements of house music (\"Testosteron\"). Kayah first premiered some material from the album at the 40th Sopot International Song Festival on August 23, 2003. The album was subsequently promoted by Stereo Tour at various clubs in Poland. Stereo typ's lead single, \"Testosteron\", was met with a huge commercial success. The album topped Polish albums chart and was nominated to four Fryderyk awards. == Track listing == Adapted from the album's sleeve. #\"Do D.N.A.\" - 4:32 #\"Jeszcze ta noc\" - 3:15 #\"Wi\u0119kszy apetyt\" - 5:22 #\"Testosteron\" - 3:07 #\"Ko\u0142ysanka dla serca\" - 5:03 #\"Twoja d\u0142o\u0144\" - 4:45 #\"Pro\u015bba do twoich ust\" - 4:23 #\"Teren zaminowany\" - 4:18 #\"Nigdy si\u0119 nie dowiem czy\" - 3:35 #\"Dziel\u0119 na p\u00f3\u0142\" - 6:04 #\"Dobre z\u0142e niewa\u017cne\" - 3:41 #\"M\u0105drala Mont Rala\" - 4:32 #\"Do It Right\" - 2:49 Cassette bonus :14. \"Testosteron\" (Orkiestra mix) - 3:15 CD bonus :14. \"Testosteron\" (Video) - 3:07 == Commercial performance == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Country !Peak position !Sales !Certification |- |align=\"center\"|Poland |align=\"center\"|1 |align=\"center\"|35,000 |align=\"center\"|Gold |- |} == References == Category:2003 albums Category:Kayah (singer) albums ",
