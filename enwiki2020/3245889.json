    "text": "A TN3270 client running on Windows A 3270 Emulator is a terminal emulator that duplicates the functions of an IBM 3270 mainframe computer terminal on a PC or similar microcomputer. As the original 3270 series terminals were connected to the host computer through a display controller (cluster controller) using coaxial cable, emulators originally required channel (rare), coax or synchronous communication adapter cards to be installed in the PC. Today, many emulators communicate with the mainframe computer through a TN3270 server using the TN3270 () variant of the Telnet ()protocol common on TCP/IP networks including the Internet, so special hardware is no longer required on machines with Internet access. Several vendors offered both coax and communications attached 3270 emulators and TN3270 clients as part of the same product. ==Products== DCA IRMA II ISA for PCs. In 1983, IBM marketed the IBM 3270 PC, a bundled package including a PC, a graphics adapter, 3270 emulation software and coax interface card. 3270 emulators and TN3270 clients are also available from many third-party vendors like Attachmate and Ericom. Some solutions permitted a coax interface to be shared by workstations in a LAN. ==See also== *Irma board *Terminal emulator *Systems Network Architecture (SNA) *Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) *TN3270 *TN3270 Plus *IND$FILE ==External links== *x3270: open-source, multi-platform TN3270 client *TN3270: emulator for Linux, Windows, Mac OS X *Virtel: terminal thin-client emulation for 3270 mainframe screens *QWS3270 PLUS, a TN3270 client by Jolly Giant Software *QWS3270 Secure, a TN3270E client by Jolly Giant Software *Vista tn3270, a TN3270 emulator by Tom Brennan Software *Rocket BlueZone: a 3270 terminal emulator by Rocket Software *Nexus Terminal, a TN3270/TN5250, SSH, SFTP/FTPS and printer client by Nexus Integration *FlexTerm, a TN3270 client by FlexSoftware Inc *Mocha TN3270, a TN3270 client by Mochasoft *Extra!
