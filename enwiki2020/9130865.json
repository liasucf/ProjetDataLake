    "text": "Stuart Lane (born 12 November 1952) is a former international rugby union player. In 1980 he toured South Africa with the British and Irish Lions and at the time played club rugby for Cardiff RFC. ==British and Irish Lions== Lane holds the unfortunate record of the shortest career of any Lions tourist, having been injured in the first minute of the opening game of the 1980 tour. This injury was a blow to the tourists as it was felt that the pace Lane could have provided in the breakaway positions would have been a strong asset for the Lions.Rothmans Rugby Yearbook, Vivian Jenkins (1982) pg 18. He still lives in Tredegar and is part owner of Rhyd Hall. == Beyond Rugby == When his rugby playing career ended, Stuart pursued his other great interest - fast cars. After many enjoyable years of owning a Caterham 7 Supersport, he built from scratch a Healey Sprite or \u201cfrogeye\u201d as they\u2019re known, with a brand new shell and many new parts. However, this was never going to be quick enough for Stuart and the cars power was provided by a modern 1800 K series engine producing 3 times the horsepower of the Sprite\u2019s original A series. The Stuart Morris Lane Trophy presentation Stuart\u2019s reputation for driving fast resulted in the creation of the \u201cStuart Morris Lane Trophy\u201d, an item highly prized amongst his fellow Midget and Sprite owning friends. ==References== Category:1952 births Category:Sportspeople from Tredegar Category:Welsh rugby union players Category:Wales international rugby union players Category:British and Irish Lions rugby union players from Wales Category:Rugby union flankers Category:Cardiff RFC players Category:Newport RFC players Category:Living people ",
