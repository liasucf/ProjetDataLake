For example, while Urdu has 52 million speakers (2001), in no state is it a majority language. India is home to several hundred languages. Most Indians speak a language belonging to the families of the Indo-Aryan branch of Indo-European (c. 77%), the Dravidian (c. 20.61%), the Austroasiatic (Munda) (c. 1.2%), or the Sino-Tibetan (c. 0.8%), with some languages of the Himalayas still unclassified. The SIL Ethnologue lists 415 living languages for India. == Overview == India's central government has 23 constitutionally recognized official languages. Hindi and English are typically used as an official language by the central government. State governments use their respective official languages. Hindi is the most widely spoken language in the northern parts of India. The Indian census takes the widest possible definition of \"Hindi\" as a broad variety of the \"Hindi Belt\". According to 2001 Census, 53.6% of the Indian population declared that they speak Hindi as either their first or second language, in which 41% of them have declared it as their native language or mother tongue.2001 census data 12% of Indians declared that they can speak English as a second language.In 1991, there were 90,000,000 \"users\" of English. (Census of India Indian Census , Issue 10, 2003, pp. 8\u201310, (Feature: Languages of West Bengal in Census and Surveys, Bilingualism and Trilingualism) and Tropf, Herbert S. 2004. India and its Languages . Siemens AG, Munich.) Thirteen languages account for more than 1% of Indian population each, and between themselves for over 95%; all of them are \"scheduled languages of the constitution\". Scheduled languages spoken by fewer than 1% of Indians are Santali (0.63%), Kashmiri (0.54%), Nepali (0.28%), Sindhi (0.25%), Konkani (0.24%), Dogri (0.22%), Meitei (0.14%), Bodo (0.13%) and Sanskrit (In the 2001 census of India, only 14,135 people reported Sanskrit as their native language). The largest language that is not \"scheduled\" is Bhili (0.95%), followed by Gondi (0.27%), Khandeshi (0.21%), Tulu (0.17%) and Kurukh (0.10%). Of the Indian population in 1991, 19.4% exhibited bilingualism and 7.2% exhibited trilingualism. India has a Greenberg's diversity index of 0.914\u2014i.e. two people selected at random from the country will have different native languages in 91.4% of cases. As per the 2011 Census of India, languages by highest number of speakers are as follows: Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Telugu, Tamil, Gujarati, Urdu, Kannada, Odia, Malayalam.Statement 4 : Scheduled Languages in descending order of speakers' strength \u2013 2011 == List of languages by number of native speakers == Ordered by number of speakers as first language. === More than one million speakers === The 2001 census recorded 29 individual languages as having more than 1 million native speakers (0.1% of total population). The languages in bold are scheduled languages (the only scheduled language with less than 1 million native speakers is Sanskrit).
