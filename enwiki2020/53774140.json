    "text": "Rhodohypoxis baurii, the red star or rosy posy, is a species of flowering plant in the family Hypoxidae that is native to damp meadows in eastern South Africa.Hogan, Sean, chief consultant. 2003, 2004. \"Flora A Gardener's Encyclopedia\", Global Nook Publishing Pty Ltd, Timber Press. . pp. 1202Brickell, Christopher \"The Royal Horticultural Society A-Z of Garden Plants\", 3rd ed. Copyright 1996, 2003, 2008 Dorling Kindersley Ltd., London. pp. 901 Growing to no more than tall and broad, it is a herbaceous perennial with lanceolate, sharply folded, hairy grey-green leaves, and pale or deep pink star-shaped flowers throughout summer. The upturned flowers are held on slender, short straight stalks. The tepals are of equal length and held alternately in two ranks. The specific epithet baurii is named for Reverend L. R. Baur (1825-1889), who collected Rhodohypoxis in South Africa.Gledhill, David (2008). \"The Names of Plants\". Cambridge University Press. (hardback), (paperback). pp 67, 209, 331 ==Cultivation== It prefers a peaty, acid soil which stays reliably moist in summer but dries out in winter to ensure a suitable dormant period. The necessary conditions may be achieved in a pot or trough, or by planting it in peat pockets. Propagation is by seed or division. Many cultivars have been developed for ornamental garden use. Most are larger- flowered and more vigorous than the species. Cultivar names include \u2018Apple Blossom\u2019, \u2018Dawn\u2019, \u2018Emily Peel\u2019 and \u2018Susan Garnett-Bottfield\u2019. Rhodohypoxis baurii has gained the Royal Horticultural Society\u2019s Award of Garden Merit. ==References== Category:Hypoxidaceae Category:Flora of South Africa ",
