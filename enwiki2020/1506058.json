Smyth served in the Virginia Senate, Virginia House of Delegates, United States House of Representatives and as a general during the War of 1812. Smyth County, Virginia, is named in his honor. ==Early life== Smyth was born on the Island of Rathlin, Ireland. He immigrated to the United States with his father, Rev. Alfred Smythe at the age of 10, and settled in Botetourt County, Virginia, in 1775 where he completed preparatory studies. He studied law, and was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Abingdon, Virginia. Smyth moved to Wythe County, Virginia, and was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates in 1792, 1796, 1801, 1802, and from 1804 to 1808.

Shortly after the outbreak of the War of 1812, Smyth was promoted to brigadier general on July 6, 1812. During the Battle of Queenston Heights he refused to support his commander, General Stephen Van Rensselaer, a militia commander with no experience. After Van Rensselaer's disgrace, Smyth was given command and proved himself equally inept. His plan to invade Canada started with the Battle of Frenchman's Creek but was then abandoned because of problems due to poor organization.Quimby, p. 77 After the failed attack on Canada, Smyth was insulted by Brigadier General Peter B. Porter, who accused Smyth of cowardice. Smyth challenged Porter to a duel, but both men went unscathed. The historian John R. Elting wrote of the duel, stating, \"Unfortunately, both missed.\"Elting, p. 51 In the wake of his failure, Smyth's name was removed from the U.S. Army rolls.Quimby, p. 78 ==Postwar career== After the war, Smyth resumed the practice of law, and again became a member of the Virginia House of Delegates in 1816, 1817, 1826, and 1827.
