    "text": "The Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Mensheviks) () was a political party in Russia. It emerged in 1912 as the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was divided into two, the other group being the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks). However, the Mensheviks and Bolsheviks had existed as factions of the original party since 1903.Kowalski, Werner. Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 - 19. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. pp. 336\u2013337. == History == Leaders of the Menshevik Party at Norra Bantorget in Stockholm, Sweden, May 1917 (Pavel Axelrod, Julius Martov and Alexander Martinov) After the 1912 split, the General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia became a federated part of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Menshevik) as by this time the Mensheviks had accepted the idea of a federated party organization.Johnpoll, Bernard K. The Politics of Futility; The General Jewish Workers Bund of Poland, 1917-1943. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1967. p. 35. At the 1917 Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Menshevik), a party Central Committee consisting of Raphael Abramovich, I. Akhmatov, I. Astrov, Pavel Axelrod, B. Gurevich, E. Broido, F. Lipkin, Fyodor Dan, Henryk Ehrlich, V. Ezhov, K. G. Gogua, B. Gorev, Ivan Maisky, Julius Martov, Alexander Martinov, A. Frumson, Pinkevich, S. Semkovskii and I. Volkov was elected. After the October Revolution, differences emerged inside the party. In 1921, the party issued the \"Platform of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party\", calling for liquidating the political monopoly of the Communist Party, which was identified as something quite different from the dictatorship of the proletariat, privatizations of large sectors of industry and giving full voting rights to the peasantry and those treated by the Soviet government as the bourgeois class. From the beginning of 1921 after the suppression of the Kronstadt garrison revolt, the 10th Communist Party Congress and the introduction of the New Economic Policy (NEP) and ending of forcible confiscation of grain from the peasantry, the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was forced to operate underground in Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union and openly only in exile in Europe and North America. The Foreign Delegation of the party had been established in 1920 and was at first located in Berlin (until 1933), then shifted to Paris and in 1940 moved to New York City.Liebich, Andr\u00e9: From the other shore: Russian social democracy after 1921. Cambridge, Massachusetts, London 1997. In exile, the party consisted of small groups in Geneva, Li\u00e8ge, Berlin, Paris, Bern and New York City. Martov and Abramovich chaired the Foreign Delegation until 1923, when it was chaired by Fyodor Dan and Abramovich. Aron Jugov was the secretary of the Foreign Delegation. In 1921, the party formed part of the Vienna International, with Martov and Abramovich being two of the organizers. At the founding Congress of the Labour and Socialist International (LSI) in 1923, eleven Menshevik delegates participated. The party was a member of the LSI from 1923\u20131940. Abramovich represented the party in the LSI executive during this entire period, being a member of the LSI bureau until May 1939.Kowalski, Werner. Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 - 19. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. p. 294. The party published Sotsialisticheskii vestnik (Socialist Courier) from 1921\u20131965 (from 1 February 1921 to 1933 in Berlin, then in Paris until 1940 and in New York from then until 1965). == References == Category:Defunct socialist parties in Russia Category:Mensheviks Category:Members of the Labour and Socialist International Category:Political parties established in 1912 Category:1912 establishments in the Russian Empire Category:Political parties of the Russian Revolution Category:Political parties in the Soviet Union Category:Soviet opposition groups Category:Banned socialist parties Category:Anti-communist organizations ",
