    "text": "Nantgarw (High Level) Halt railway station was a halt on the disused Pontypridd, Caerphilly & Newport Railway. ==History and description== The halt opened in 1904. It was without raised platforms, having only ground-level wooden shelters which were sealed off from the tracks by wooden enclosures which were unlocked by the conductor when a train arrived.Hutton, J. The Newport Docks & Railway Company. Silver Link. 1996, p. 93 In 1924, it was renamed to avoid confusion with the similarly-named halt on the former Cardiff Railway, Nantgarw (Low Level) Halt, which closed in 1931.Hutton, J. An Illustrated History of Cardiff Docks. Silver Link. 2009. p. 54 The signs at Nantgarw (High Level) Halt read simply 'Nantgarw' in its last years. The halt closed in 1956. Its location is no longer easily identifiable. The site is now part of the Nantgarw-Treforest cycle-way. ==References== Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1904 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1956 Category:Former Great Western Railway stations Category:Disused railway stations in Rhondda Cynon Taf ",
