    "text": "Barry Douglas Milburn (born 24 November 1943 in Dunedin) was a cricketer who played three Tests for New Zealand in 1969. Milburn's daughter Rowan has kept wicket for both the Netherlands and New Zealand at international level. ==Domestic career== Milburn was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a competent wicketkeeper who played for Otago from 1963 to 1983. Milburn dropped out of first-class cricket after the 1973\u201374 season, but returned for Otago in 1980\u201381, scoring a century in his comeback match against Wellington, when he went in as a nightwatchman. His second highest score in a near-20-year career was only 36. He finally retired after the 1982\u201383 season. ==International career== He was one of a succession of New Zealand Test wicketkeepers of modest batting ability in the mid to late 1960s, and was first choice for only one Test series, the three matches in New Zealand against the West Indies in 1968-69 when, like his predecessor Roy Harford he batted at number 11. Milburn also toured England in 1969 and India in 1969\u201370, but Ken Wadsworth, a much better bat, was seen as the principal keeper on both tours, though an injury in the later stages of the England tour did not help Milburn's cause at a time when Wadsworth was also struggling for runs. ==See also== * List of Otago representative cricketers Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:New Zealand cricketers Category:New Zealand Test cricketers Category:Otago cricketers Category:People educated at Taieri College ",
