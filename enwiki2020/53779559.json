    "text": "Ronald de la Fuente Arias (born January 25, 1991) is a Chilean footballer who plays for Colo-Colo of the Chilean Primera Divisi\u00f3n. He plays as a defender. ==Life and career== De la Fuente was born in Talcahuano, where he began his football career with Huachipato. He made a few appearances in the 2011 Clausura and the 2012 Apertura before joining another Primera Divisi\u00f3n club, San Marcos de Arica, on loan. He made only three appearances in the 2013 Transici\u00f3n before making another loan move, to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n (third-tier) club Iberia, under the management of Ronald Fuentes. He started 18 matches as Iberia won the 2013\u201314 title, before returning to his parent club for whom he made three appearances in the group stages of the Copa Chile. De la Fuente rejoined Iberia for the 2014\u201315 season, but injury prevented his playing as much as he would have liked. After Fuentes took over as manager of Primera Divisi\u00f3n club Universidad de Concepci\u00f3n, he signed De la Fuente. He made 11 appearances in the 2015 Apertura and 9 in that season's Copa Chile, helping his team reach the semifinals, as well as appearing on the losing side in the 2015 Supercopa. Although he played little in the Clausura, he established himself in the starting eleven the following season, and his performances attracted attention from other clubs. In early 2018, De la Fuente played in the Copa Libertadores for Universidad de Concepci\u00f3n against Vasco da Gama of Brazil: despite a 4\u20130 defeat in the first leg, he felt the tie was not over, but, at 2\u20130 down in the return leg, he was sent off for kicking an opponent in the groin. ==Honours== Deportes Iberia * Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de Chile: 2013\u201314 ==References== ==External links== *Profile at BDFA Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Chilean footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Association football defenders Category:Huachipato footballers Category:Deportes Iberia footballers Category:San Marcos de Arica footballers Category:Universidad de Concepci\u00f3n footballers Category:Colo-Colo footballers Category:Chilean Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n Profesional players Category:Primera B de Chile players ",
