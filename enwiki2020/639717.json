Big band giving a concert just outside a department store in the middle of the shopping district Kichijoji is a neighborhood in the city of Musashino in Tokyo, Japan. It is centered on a compact but very popular commercial area to the north of its train station and to the south a little, with a full range of shops, restaurants, bars, and coffee houses. Kichij\u014dji Station is served by the Ch\u016b\u014d Line which runs to Tokyo Central Station in around 30 minutes, Sobu Line, Tozai Line and is also a terminus of the Kei\u014d Inokashira Line, which takes passengers as far as Shibuya, another fashionable shopping center in Tokyo, in around 20 minutes on the express service. The area is a popular place centre for shopping and leisure in the Tokyo metropolitan area and is also home to Inokashira Park and its zoo. The area has been voted the number 1 place that people in Japan wish they would live, every year since the 1990s according to polls by the magazine CNN GO. The best place to live in Tokyo is...], Robert Michael Poole, CNN GO, 22 February 2011 == History == This town was named after the Kichij\u014d-ji Temple which was located in Bunky\u014d City, Tokyo, before being destroyed by fire in the year 1657. This temple, in turn, derived its name from the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, corresponding to Kissh\u014dten in Japan. During the Great fire of Meireki, the town in front of Suwazan Kichij\u014d-ji Temple gate, Edo's Hongo Motomachi (now: Hong\u014d 1-chome, Bunky\u014d, near Suid\u014dbashi Station) was destroyed by fire. Afterwards, based on town planning, the shogunate rebuilt the area for daimy\u014d residences. Since the residents who used to live in front of Kichijo-ji gate had suffered great loss of residence and farm land, the shogunate's official reed lands named \"Reno\" and \"Mureno\" were provided as substitute land for them. Those hoping to apply were given a rice stipend and house construction loans with a 5 year limit. Kichijo-ji samurai, Sato Sadaemon and Miyazaki Jinemon, in cooperation with local farmer Matsui Jurozaemon, opened up the eastern district of present day Musashino and relocated the residents there. Soon after, with the opening of the Tamagawa Aqueduct, the previously poorly watered uninhabited Musashino Plateau was cultivated, turning it into a vast farmland. In the process, the neatly partitioned thin rectangular shaped plots of land along Itsukaichi Kaid\u014d (ja) (currently Tokyo Metropolitan Route 7, Suginami Akiruno Line) were formed. Some migrants were granted great lengths of land of more than 1000 meters long in the land area extending from Itsukaichi Kaid\u014d to the Tamagawa Aqueduct, up to where the Senkawa Aqueduct (ja) divides. But the soil was not particularly fertile, so all of the farmland became dry soil fields, with no wet rice fields. Because of the residents who still had attachment to the former Kichijo-ji, the new fields were named Kichij\u014dji Village. == Economy == The neighborhood is dominated by a shopping district centered on a covered street, Sun Road, which extends north from Kichij\u014dji Station. This well organized and clean area includes amenities, shops, entertainment and restaurants. Halfway up this shopping street is the Buddhist temple Gess\u014d-ji (\u6708\u7a93\u5bfa), with graveyard, and at the northern end of it are Shinto shrines, the latter holding the occasional festival, with amusements such as fishing for gold fish, sweet food stalls, and typical dishes. On the north, east, and south sides of the station is a large nightlife area with many restaurants, bars, izakaya, and \"live\" houses. On the north-east side of the station lies a red-light district on the Ch\u016b\u014d Line between Tachikawa and Shinjuku, containing numerous cabarets, bars, and pink salons. The anime and manga companies Coamix and Bee Train have their headquarters in Kichij\u014dji.\"\u4e8b\u696d\u6982\u8981.\" \"\u3010\u4f4f\u6240\u3011 [\u51fa\u7248\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30c4\u4e8b\u696d\u90e8\uff08\u7de8\u96c6\u90e8\uff09\u30fb\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u4e8b\u696d\u90e8\u30fb\u7dcf\u52d9\u90e8] \u3012180-0004 \u6771\u4eac\u90fd\u6b66\u8535\u91ce\u5e02\u5409\u7965\u5bfa\u672c\u753a 2-4-14 \u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30fb\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7\u30d3\u30eb8 3F TEL/0422-29-0414\uff08\u4ee3\u8868\uff09 FAX/0422-29-0413\" Studio Ghibli was previously located in Kichij\u014dji.\"The Animerica Interview: Takahata and Nosaka: Two Grave Voices in Animation.\" Animerica.
