She was married at the age of twelve to Charles d'Angennes, vidame du Mans, and in 1612, marquis de Rambouillet. They had seven children, two sons and five daughters.G. Lenotre, Le Ch\u00e2teau de Rambouillet, six si\u00e8cles d'histoire, chapter: Les Pr\u00e9cieuses, Deno\u00ebl, Paris, 1984, p. 19. The young, beautiful and witty marquise found the coarseness and intrigues of the French court little to her taste and, in 1620, she began to gather around her the circle that gave its renown to her salon. She and her husband had taken residence in Paris at the H\u00f4tel Pisani, later renamed H\u00f4tel de Rambouillet, and which she restored between 1618 and 1620. It was situated rue Saint-Thomas-du-Louvre, between the Louvre and the Tuileries.Map of Paris by N. de Fer, dated 1705, on which the rue Saint-Thomas du Louvre, which disappeared in the mid-19th century, can be seen between the Louvre and the Tuileries: :fr:Fichier:Plan de Paris 1705 BNF07710700.png The former H\u00f4tel de Rambouillet, which belonged to the d'Angennes family, was located rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 and was sold in 1602 by her father-in-law, Nicolas d'Angennes. In 1624, it was bought by Cardinal Richelieu who had it demolished, and who built on its site his Palais Cardinal, future Palais Royal. Madame de Rambouillet arranged the former H\u00f4tel Pisani for the purpose of receiving her guests, and devised suites of small rooms where guests could move around and find more privacy than in the large reception rooms. She received her visitors in the chambre bleue, a salon painted in blue and with blue heavy brocade wall hangings.Tallemant des R\u00e9aux Historiettes, chapter Madame de Rambouillet, \"M\u00e9moires\" reviewed by MM.

Almost all major personages of the French aristocracy and literature of the time frequented it, and its reputation was at its height in the second quarter of the century. Occasionally, in spring and summer, the marquis and marquise de Rambouillet would entertain the habitu\u00e9s of their Parisian residence in the ch\u00e2teau de Rambouillet and its beautiful park.Tallemant des R\u00e9aux, p. 265G. Lenotre, pp. 24-25. Her success as a literary hostess (the term salonni\u00e8re did not appear before the 19th century) has many explanations. Her natural abilities had been carefully trained. The marquise had a genuine kindness and a lack of prejudice that enabled her to entertain princes and princesses of the blood royal and literary men with the same grace, whilst among her intimate friends was the beautiful actress Ang\u00e9lique Paulet. The respect paid to ability in the salon effected a great advancement in the position of French men of letters. Moreover, the almost uniform excellence of the memoirs and letters of 17th century French men and women may be traced largely to the development of conversation as a fine art at the H\u00f4tel de Rambouillet, and the consequent establishment of a standard of clear and adequate expression. Mme de Rambouillet was known as the \"incomparable Arth\u00e9nice\", the name being an anagram for \"Catherine\", devised by Fran\u00e7ois de Malherbe and Racan. Among the more noteworthy episodes in the history of the H\u00f4tel de Rambouillet are the literary quarrel between the Uranistes and the Jobelins - respective partisans of two famous sonnets, the Sonnet d'Uranie, by Vincent Voiture, and the Sonnet de Job, by Isaac de Benserade - and the composition by almost all the great poets of the day of the Guirlande de Julie, a collection of forty-one madrigals, each on the theme of a flower, offered in 1641 to Julie d'Angennes by Charles de Sainte Maure, who had been wooing her for ten years when he conceived the idea of the handsome manuscript, but whom she kept waiting four more years. Julie herself, the H\u00f4tel de Rambouillet Princesse Julie, was responsible for a good deal of the preciosity for which the Pr\u00e9cieuses were later ridiculed by Moli\u00e8re. The Pr\u00e9cieuses, who are usually associated with Moli\u00e8re's avowed caricatures and with the extravagances of Mlle de Scud\u00e9ry, but a name Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 herself was proud to bear, insisted on a ceremonious gallantry from their suitors and friends, though it seems from the account given by Tallemant des R\u00e9aux that mild practical jokes took place at the H\u00f4tel de Rambouillet. They especially favoured an elaborate and quintessenced kind of colloquial and literary expression, imitated from Giambattista Marini and Lu\u00eds de G\u00f3ngora y Argote, then fashionable throughout Europe. Moli\u00e8re's immortal Pr\u00e9cieuses ridicules was no doubt directly levelled not at the H\u00f4tel de Rambouillet itself, but at the numerous coteries which in the course of years had sprung up in imitation of it. The satire affected the originators as well as the imitators, the former more closely perhaps than they perceived. The H\u00f4tel de Rambouillet remained in existence until the death of its hostess, although the troubles of the Fronde diminished its influence. The chief original authorities respecting Madame de Rambouillet and her set are Tallemant des R\u00e9aux in his Historiettes, and Antoine Baudeau de Somaize in his Grand Dictionnaire des Pr\u00e9cieuses (1660). 1705 Map of Paris by N. de Fer, showing the rue Saint-Thomas du Louvre between the Louvre and the Tuileries.
