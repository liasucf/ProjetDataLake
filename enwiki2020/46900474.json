    "text": "The Sacred Mushroom was a blues rock and psychedelic rock band from Cincinnati, Ohio, active from 1966-1969. They were one of Cincinnati's top bands in the late 1960s. The band was led by guitarist and songwriter Larry Goshorn and his younger brother, vocalist Danny Goshorn. All members lived in a house in Cincinnati called \"Mushroom House\" that \"sheltered a small tribe\" to escape from \"the rich-blundering-narrow-minded-owner-of-the-non-essential- producing-factory.\" In 1967, the band recorded a debut 45rpm 7\" single, \"Break Away Girl\" b/w \"Yellow Fever,\" which was released in the same year by Nashville-based Minaret Records. The single received local and regional airplay. The band was focused on guitarist, singer and songwriter Larry Goshorn and his brother, vocalist Danny. They recorded one album in 1969 which included original material and the covers of T-Bone Walker's \"Mean Old World\" and Ray Davies' \"I'm Not Like Everybody Else\".\"The Sacred Mushroom\" LP was released in 1969 by NYC label Parallax records, the 'underground' subsidiary of Audio Fidelity Records. The band dissolved due to unknown circumstances in 1969. Both Larry and Danny Goshorn would later join the Cincinnati band Pure Prairie League with their other brother Tim Goshorn. The brothers were active in Pure Prairie League in various forms in the 1970s and 1980s before leaving to form The Goshorn Brothers Band.
