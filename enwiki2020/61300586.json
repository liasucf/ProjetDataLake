He graduated first in his class from The Culinary Institute of America (CIA) in 2003. == Career == After graduating from Michigan, Lam moved back to New York and worked as a grant writer for non-profit organizations before attending CIA. While at CIA, he wrote emails to friends describing his experiences. The emails got passed around, and he was contacted by an editor at Financial Times who had read some of them and asked Lam to write for the publication. In 2004 he met Ruth Reichl, then editor of Gourmet, and started freelancing for Gourmet. In 2007 he received a contract from Gourmet for regular work. At the time he was living in Biloxi, Mississippi, working part-time for a non-profit helping with cleanup after Hurricane Katrina. In 2009 he moved back to New York. He has written for Food & Wine, Salon and Bon App\u00e9tit and wrote a regular column, Eat, about immigrant cooking for New York Times Magazine. In 2013 he became editor-at-large at Clarkson Potter, editing cookbooks. One of his first acquisitions was Victuals: An Appalachian Journey by Ronni Lundy.
