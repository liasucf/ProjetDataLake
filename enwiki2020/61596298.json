    "text": "The Shire Hall is a municipal building in Foregate Street, Worcester. It is a Grade II* listed building. ==History== Citizens of Worcester petitioned the House of Lords for permission to buld a new County Hall in 1831. The building, which was designed by Charles Day and Henry Rowe in the Greek Revival style, was completed in 1835. A statue of Queen Victoria, designed by Sir Thomas Brock, was erected in front of the building in 1887. Shire Hall was originally used as a facility for dispensing justice but, following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, it also became the meeting place for Worcestershire County Council. After the Worcestershire County Council was abolished in 1974, the new authority, Hereford and Worcester County Council moved their base to County Hall in 1978 and the Shire Hall's activities were restricted to that of a Crown Court. ==References== W Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Worcestershire Category:Government buildings completed in 1835 ",
