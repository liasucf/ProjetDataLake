He was the first wrestler from Mongolia to reach sumo's top makuuchi division. ==Career== He was a diligent practitioner of Mongolian wrestling from a young age, but had ambitions of becoming a policeman. However, in late 1991, a Japanese sumo training stable master, \u014cshima-oyakata (the former \u014dzeki Asahikuni) went to Mongolia to recruit promising wrestlers for sumo. The young Davaagiin Batbayar happened to notice the advertisement and applied along with 120 others. He was selected and went to Japan with five others, including Kyukotenh\u014d and Kyokutenzan. They were the first Mongolians ever to join sumo. He was immediately given the shikona of Kyokush\u016bzan, meaning \"eagle mountain of the rising sun.\" He made his professional debut in March 1992. However six months later, due to cultural differences, language problems, and an extremely hard training regime, five of them including Kyokush\u016bzan ran away from the training stable to the Mongolian embassy. He was eventually persuaded to return by his stablemaster's wife, and also Kyokutenzan. In March 1995, he was promoted to the j\u016bry\u014d division, and in September 1996 to the top makuuchi division. After his single appearance as a komusubi in March 1997 he was ranked as a maegashira for 58 tournaments in a row, a record in the sumo world. He was a runner-up in two tournaments in March 2003 and September 2004, and was awarded five special prizes for his achievements in tournaments \u2013 two for Technique, two for Fighting Spirit and one for Outstanding Performance. He also earned five kinboshi or gold stars for defeating yokozuna, the last coming in May 2003 against fellow Mongolian Asash\u014dry\u016b. Determined to get revenge in the next tournament in July, Asash\u014dry\u016b pulled on Kyokush\u016bzan's topknot; a foul for which he was disqualified (hansoku), the first time this had ever happened to a yokozuna (Kyokush\u016bzan did not get a kinboshi on that occasion as they are not given for wins by hansoku). As he succeeded in the ring, his popularity in Mongolia soared. Also, as he has contributed much to his country by establishing several foundations for the welfare of the youth and sick people, he is now regarded as one of the heroes of the country. In April 2004, he started to study on a correspondence course for an MSc in telecommunications at Waseda University in Japan. This is partly because the Mongolian president advised him to study while in Japan for his future. ==Fighting style== At the beginning of his top division career he gained great popularity with audiences due to his variety of techniques, which were influenced by Mongolian wrestling. Less often seen in sumo, they surprised many of his early opponents. He was known as the gino depato, or \"department store of techniques.\" In the May 2002 tournament, he won his first eight bouts in a row, using eight different techniques. However, because he was in danger of injuring other wrestlers, he was eventually told by the Sumo Association to stop using some of them, and by the end of his career he had a much more defensive (and less successful) style. His most common winning kimarite overall were uwatenage (overarm throw) and yorikiri (force out), using his preferred mawashi grip of migi-yotsu (left hand outside, right hand inside). However his next most common were hatakikomi (slap down) and hikiotoshi (pull down), reflecting his change of style. ==Retirement from sumo== In November 2006, he suddenly announced his retirement two days into the Kyushu tournament. At the time this was thought to be because of a heart problem. A ceremony in his honour was held in Ulaanbaatar at the end of 2006, attended by the Mongolian Prime Minister, who thanked him for strengthening the ties between Mongolia and Japan. Kyokush\u016bzan's danpatsu-shiki, the official retirement ceremony where the retired rikishi's topknot is cut off, was reportedly going to be held in Mongolia, but eventually took place at the Ry\u014dgoku Kokugikan in Tokyo on June 2, 2007. Soon after the ceremony, on June 4, 2007, Kyokush\u016bzan released his memorial photobook featuring Anna Tsuchiya.\u65ed\u9df2\u5c71\u5f15\u9000\u8a18\u5ff5\u30de\u30ac\u30b8\u30f3\u3067\u30b3\u30e9\u30dc It subsequently emerged that Kyokush\u016bzan was the victim of an attempted extortion by gangsters, linked to the Sumiyoshi-kai crime syndicate. The gangsters were all arrested, and Kyokush\u016bzan told police that this incident was one reason for his retirement.\u3053\u308c\u3082\u5f15\u9000\u306e\u52d5\u6a5f\u300d\u65ed\u9df2\u5c71\u3078\u306e\u6050\u559d\u672a\u9042\u3067\u66b4\u529b\u56e3\u54e1\u3089\u902e\u6355 Yomiuri Shimbun 2007-07-25 He moved into Mongolian politics and in June 2008 was elected to the Mongolian parliament on the opposition Democratic Party ticket. In the 2012 Parliamentary elections, he ran in his native Khovd Province but was not elected. He worked as an advisor on Japan to the Prime Minister of Mongolia Chimediin Saikhanbileg from 2013. He ran for the Democratic Party again in the 2020 Parliamentary elections but was once more unsuccessful. During his active career and since his retirement Kyokush\u016bzan has been an active recruiter of Mongolian sumo wrestlers to enter professional sumo, using his connections to help fellow Mongolians interested in joining sumo to find a stable looking to recruit a foreign wrestler. In this regard, he was instrumental in starting the careers of younger sumo wrestlers such as Hakuh\u014d, Tamawashi and M\u014dkonami. He estimates he has recruited around 25 Mongolians for professional sumo over the years. ==Personal life== He married in May 2000 to a Mongolian girl who was studying in Japan. The couple have a son and a daughter. ==Career record== ==See also== *List of sumo tournament top division runners-up *List of sumo tournament second division champions *Glossary of sumo terms *List of non-Japanese sumo wrestlers *List of past sumo wrestlers *List of komusubi ==References== ==External links== * Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:Mongolian sumo wrestlers Category:Komusubi Category:Members of the State Great Khural Category:Democratic Party (Mongolia) politicians Category:Sportspeople from Ulaanbaatar Category:Mongolian sportsperson- politicians Category:Mongolian expatriates in Japan ",
