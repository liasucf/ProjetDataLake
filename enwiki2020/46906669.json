Associations affiliated with FIFA might send teams to participate in the tournament. Men's teams were restricted to under-22 players (born on or after 1 January 1995) with a maximum of three overage players allowed, while there were no age restrictions on women's teams. In the men's tournament, Thailand continued their title as a defending champion after they won their sixteenth SEA Games men's gold medal in the tournament by beating Malaysia with a score 1\u20130, while Indonesia got bronze for the fourth time after beating Myanmar with a score 3\u20131. Meanwhile in the women's tournament, Vietnam pipped Thailand for their fifth SEA Games women\u2019s gold medal after they scored a 6\u20130 win over Malaysia in a round-robin format that subsequently gave them a superior goal difference. Myanmar defended the bronze after losing to the two favourites: Vietnam and Thailand. ==Competition schedule== The following was the competition schedule for the football competitions: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:90%; line-height:1.25em;\" |- |bgcolor=\"#FA7894\" align=center|G||Group stage |bgcolor=\"#FAD978\" align=center|\u00bd||Semifinals |bgcolor=\"#7DE5FA\" align=center|B||3rd place play- off |bgcolor=\"#7DE5FA\" align=center|F||Final |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:90%; line-height:1.25em; text- align:center\" !Event||Mon 14||Tue 15||Wed 16||Thu 17||Fri 18||Sat 19||Sun 20||Mon 21||Tue 22||Wed 23||Thu 24||Fri 25||Sat 26||Sun 27||Mon 28|| colspan=\"2\"|Tue 29 |- |Men||bgcolor=\"#FA7894\" |G ||bgcolor=\"#FA7894\" |G ||bgcolor=\"#FA7894\" |G ||bgcolor=\"#FA7894\" |G ||bgcolor=\"#FA7894\" |G ||||bgcolor=\"#FA7894\" |G ||bgcolor=\"#FA7894\" |G||bgcolor=\"#FA7894\" |G ||bgcolor=\"#FA7894\" |G ||bgcolor=\"#FA7894\" |G || ||bgcolor=\"#FAD978\" |\u00bd ||||||bgcolor=\"#7DE5FA\" |B || bgcolor=\"#7DE5FA\" |F |- |Women|| || bgcolor=\"#FA7894\" |G|| ||bgcolor=\"#FA7894\" |G|| || ||bgcolor=\"#FA7894\" |G || ||bgcolor=\"#FA7894\" |G || ||bgcolor=\"#FA7894\" | G || || || || ||colspan=2| |} ==Venues== Four venues in three cities were used in the tournament. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !

The Bukit Jalil National Stadium were also originally planned for the men's football final matches before it was changed to Shah Alam Stadium due to several factors. ==Participating nations== ===Men's tournament=== * * * * * * * * * * * ===Women's tournament=== * * * * * ==Men's competition== === Group stage === ==== Group A ==== ==== Group B ==== === Knockout stage === ==Women's competition== ==Medal summary== ===Medal table=== ===Medalists=== {| |- |Men's tournament |nowrap=true| Anusith Termmee Sasalak Haiprakhon Suriya Singmui Worawut Namvech Shinnaphat Lee-Oh Chaowat Veerachat Nattawut Sombatyotha Nopphon Ponkam Chenrop Samphaodi Chaiyawat Buran Kevin Deeromram Peerawat Akkatam Picha U-Tra Montree Promsawat Saringkan Promsupa Phitiwat Sukjitthammakul Ratthanakorn Maikami Worachit Kanitsribampen Sittichok Kannoo Nont Muangngam |nowrap=true| Norman Haikal Rendra Iskandar Abang Nur Afirman Abang Norazman Najmudin Akmal Adib Zainuddin Muhd Syahmi Safari Safawi Rasid Wan Kuzri Wan Kamal Muhd Nor Azam Abdul Azih Adam Nor Azlin Kumaahran Sathasivam Dominic Tan Thanabalan Nadarajah Ariff Farhan Isa Syamer Kutty Abba Syazwan Andik Danial Amier Norhisham Irfan Zakaria Akhyar Rashid Ifwat Akmal Syafiq Ahmad |nowrap=true| Satria Tama Hardiyanto Putu Gede Juni Antara Andy Setyo Ryuji Utomo Evan Dimas Muhammad Hargianto Ezra Walian Gavin Kwan Adsit Febri Haryadi Asnawi Mangkualam Bahar Ricky Fajrin Saddil Ramdani Kurniawan Ajie Hanif Abdurrauf Sjahbandi Yabes Roni Hansamu Yama Marinus Maryanto Wanewar Osvaldo Haay Rezaldi Hehanusa Septian David Maulana |- |Women's tournament |nowrap=true| \u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u1ecb Ki\u1ec1u Trinh Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Xuy\u1ebfn Ch\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb Ki\u1ec1u V\u0169 Th\u1ecb Th\u00fay B\u00f9i Th\u1ecb Nh\u01b0 V\u0169 Th\u1ecb Nhung Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Tuy\u1ebft Dung Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Li\u1ec5u Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb Th\u00f9y Trang Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec7t Ph\u1ea1m H\u1ea3i Y\u1ebfn Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Mu\u00f4n Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb Kim Thanh Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb B\u00edch Th\u00f9y Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1ea3i H\u00f2a Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb V\u1ea1n Hu\u1ef3nh Nh\u01b0 B\u00f9i Th\u00fay An Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Thanh H\u1ea3o Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb H\u1ed3ng Nhung |nowrap=true| Waraporn Boonsing Natthakarn Chinwong Duangnapa Sritala Ainon Phancha Pikul Khueanpet Silawan Intamee Naphat Seesraum Warunee Phetwiset Sunisa Srangthaisong Alisa Rukpinij Rattikan Thongsombut Orathai Srimanee Nipawan Panyosuk Khwanrudi Saengchan Taneekarn Dangda Yada Sengyong Pitsamai Sornsai Kanjana Sungngoen Nisa Romyen Saowalak Pengngam |nowrap=true| Mya Phu Ngon Khin Than Wai Zin Mar Win Wai Wai Aung Phu Pwint Khaing San San Maw Win Theingi Tun Naw Ar Lo Wer Phaw Yee Yee Oo Khin Marlar Tun Khin Moe Wai Le Le Hlaing Than Than Htwe May Sabai Phoo Nu Nu July Kyaw Khin Mo Mo Tun Zar Zar Myint Ei Yadanar Phyo Chit Chit |} ==See also== *Football 5-a-side at the 2017 ASEAN Para Games *Football 7-a-side at the 2017 ASEAN Para Games ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * * 29th SEA Games Malaysia 2017 - Tag Archive - Sports247.My * 29th SEA Games Malaysia 2017 - Full Schedule Download ",
