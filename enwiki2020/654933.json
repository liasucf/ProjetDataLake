    "text": "Jaimee Monae Foxworth (born December 17, 1979) is an American actress, model, and former pornographic actress. She is best known for her role of Judy Winslow, the youngest daughter of Carl and Harriette Winslow on the ABC/CBS sitcom Family Matters. ==Career== Foxworth began modeling at the age of five, soon appeared in national television advertisements, and ultimately landed the role of Judy Winslow, the youngest of the Winslow family's three children, on the long-running sitcom Family Matters. ===Family Matters=== After the introduction of Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), Foxworth's scenes were reduced significantly. The combination of the character having little to do on the show and budget cuts caused producers to eliminate her off the series after its fourth season. The character disappeared without explanation, with the Winslows acknowledging only two children: Eddie (Darius McCrary) and Laura (Kellie Shanygne Williams). ===Later career=== With very little acting work coming in the years after Family Matters, Foxworth formed a R&B; musical group, S.H.E., with her two sisters (Tyren Perry, Jania Perry). They then released their debut album 3's a Charm on July 1, 1997 through Shaquille O'Neal's T.W.IsM./Interscope Records. From 2000-2002, She worked in the adult industry, making pornographic films under the pseudonym Crave. == Personal life == Foxworth battled substance abuse and depression. It was rumored that this was prompted in part by a judge's ruling that her trust fund of more than $500,000 be used to save her family from bankruptcy, but she denied this in a 2009 interview, stating, \"I think [that came] from the National Enquirer. We never filed for bankruptcy. We were almost to the point where we were just completely flat broke but we never filed for bankruptcy.\" In December 2008, People magazine reported that Foxworth was pregnant. She and longtime boyfriend Michael Shaw were expecting a child in early 2009. On May 29, 2009, People reported that Foxworth and Shaw's baby was born, a boy named Michael Douglas Shaw, Jr. He was 10 days overdue, and Foxworth shared the news of his birth while still in the delivery room via text message. In Fall 2009, the TV One series Life After chronicled Foxworth's story, dealing with her departure from Family Matters, and her subsequent marijuana use, which she claimed to have stopped smoking. During the show, her newborn son was shown. == Filmography == * Family Matters (1989\u20131993) TV Series === Notable TV guest appearances === * Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew * The Tyra Banks Show October 6, 2006 * The Oprah Winfrey Show January 29, 2006 * 20/20 April 29, 2005 * TV 101 playing Whitney Hines in episode: \"Home\" (episode #1.4) December 20, 1988 * Amen playing Choir in episode: \"Your Christmas Show of Shows\" (episode #1.11) December 20, 1986 Syress - 2018 == References == == External links == * Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:African-American actresses Category:Participants in American reality television series Category:People from Belleville, Illinois Category:Actresses from Illinois Category:20th-century American actresses Category:African-American female models Category:American female models Category:African-American models Category:American child models Category:American television actresses Category:American child actresses Category:Female models from Illinois ",
