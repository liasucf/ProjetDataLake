    "text": "The Liburnian language is an extinct language which was spoken by the ancient Liburnians, who occupied Liburnia, a variously defined region in modern southwestern Croatia, in classical times. Classification of the Liburnian language is not clearly established; it is reckoned as an Indo-European language with a significant proportion of the Pre-Indo-European elements from the wider area of the ancient Mediterranean. ==Classification== No writings in Liburnian are known. The only Liburnian linguistic remains are Liburnian toponyms and some family and personal names in Liburnia, in Latinized form from the 1st century AD. Smaller differences found in the archaeological material of narrower regions in Liburnia are in a certain measure reflected also in these scarce linguistic remains. This has caused much speculation about the language. Features shared by Liburnian and other languages have been noted in Liburnian language remains, names and toponyms, dating from between the Iron Age and the beginning of Common Era. These are insufficient for a precise linguistic classification, other than a general indication that they have an Indo-European basis, but also incorporate significant elements from Pre-Indo-European languages. This also appears to be the case in their social relations, and such phenomena are likely related to their separate cultural development, physical isolation and mixed ethnic origins.D.

Batovi\u0107, Liburnska kultura, Matica Hrvatska i Arheolo\u0161ki muzej Zadar, Zadar, 2005, UDK: 904 (398 Liburnija), , pages 65, 66 Following studies of the onomastics of the Roman province of Dalmatia, G\u00e9za Alf\u00f6ldy has suggested that the Liburni and Histri belonged to the Venetic language area.G\u00e9za Alf\u00f6ldy, Die Namensgebung der Urbev\u00f6lkerung in der r\u00f6mischen Provinz Dalmatien. Beitr\u00e4ge zur Namenforschung 15, 1964G. Alf\u00f6ldy, Die Personennamen im r\u00f6mischen Dalmatien, Heidelberg, 1969 In particular, some Liburnian anthroponyms show strong Venetic affinities, a few similar names and common roots, such as Vols-, Volt-, and Host- (< PIE *ghos-ti-, \"stranger, guest, host\"). Liburnian and Venetic names sometimes also share suffixes in common, such as -icus and -ocus. J\u00fcrgen Untermann, who has focused on Liburnian onomastics, considers that only the Liburnians at the north-eastern Istrian coast were strongly Venetic. Untermann has suggested three groups of Liburnian names: one structurally similar to those of the Veneti and Histri; another linked to the Dalmatae, Iapodes and other Illyrians on the mainland to the south of the Liburnians, and; a third group of names that were common throughout Liburnian territory, and lacked any relation to those of their neighbors.J. Untermann, Die venetischen Personennamen, Wiesbaden, 1961J. Untermann, Venetisches in Dalmatien, GCBI 5, 1970 Other proper names, such as those of local deities and toponyms also showed differing regional distributions. According to R. Kati\u010di\u0107, Liburnian toponyms, in both structure and form, also demonstrate diverse influences, including Pre-Indo-European, Indo-European and other, purely local features. Kati\u010di\u0107 has also stated that toponyms were distributed separately along ethnic and linguistic lines.R. Kati\u010di\u0107, Ancient languages of the Balkans, Trends in linguistics 4, 5, The Hague and Paris, 1976 S. \u010ca\u010de has noted that it can not be determined whether Liburnian was more related to the North Adriatic language group (Veneti, Histri) or the languages of Iapodes and Dalmatae, due to the scarcity of evidence.S. \u010ca\u010de, Liburnija u razdoblju od 4. do 1. st. prije nove ere, Zadar, 1985, 101-120 While the Liburnians differed significantly from the Histri and Veneti, both culturally and ethnically, they have been linked to the Dalmatae by their burial traditions. Other toponymical and onomastic similarities have been found between Liburnia and other regions of both Illyria and Asia Minor, especially Lycia, Lydia, Caria, Pisidia, Isauria, Pamphylia, Lycaonia and Cilicia, as well as similarities in elements of social organization, such as matriarchy/gynecocracy (gynaikokratia) and the numerical organization of territory. These are also features of the wider Adriatic region, especially Etruria, Messapia and southern Italy.M. Zaninovi\u0107, On some relations between Anatolia and Dalmatia, Proceedings of the Xth International Congress of Classical Studies, Ankara-Izmir, 20-30, Sept. 1973, Ankara 1978, 81-93 Topoymical and onomastic connections to Asia Minor may also indicate a Liburnian presence amongst the Sea Peoples.M. Zaninovi\u0107, Liburnia Militaris, Opusc. Archeol. 13, 43-67 (1988), UDK 904.930.2(497.13) \u00bb65\u00ab, page 48 The old toponym Liburnum in Liguria may also link the Liburnian name to the Etruscans,M. Fluss, Liburni, PWRE. Bd. V, 583M. Jokl in Ebert, Reallex. der Vorgeschichte, VI, 46-47 as well as the proposed Tyrsenian language family. The Liburnians underwent Romanization after being conquered by the Romans in 35 BCE. The Liburnian language was replaced by Latin, and underwent language death \u2013most likely during Late Antiquity. The Liburnians nevertheless retained some of their cultural traditions until the 4th century CE, especially in the larger cities \u2013 a fact attested by archaeology.M. Zaninovi\u0107, Liburnia Militaris, Opusc. Archeol. 13, 43\u201367 (1988), UDK 904.930.2(497.13) \u00bb65\u00ab, page 59 ==Onomastics== ===Anthroponyms=== The single name plus patronymic formula common among Illyrians is rare among Liburnians. In a region where the Roman three-name formula (praenomen, nomen gentile, cognomen: Caius Julius Caesar) spread at an early date, a native two-name formula appears in several variants. Personal name plus family name is found in southern Liburnia, while personal name plus family name plus patronymic is found throughout the Liburnian area, for example: , , , , .

The following names are judged to be exclusively Liburnian, yet one (Buzetius) is also attested among the neighboring Iapodes to the north and northeast: *Aeia *Barcinus *Buzetius *Caminis (gen.) *Ceunus *Clausus *Granp (...). Attested only in abbreviated form. *Iaefus *Lastimeis (gen. ?) *Mamaester *Pasinus *Picusus *Tetenus *Vesclevesis (gen.). The etymology is established. It is a compound, the initial element Ves- from PIE in Albanian, \"hear\"; the second element -cleves- (genitive suffix -is) from PIE *kleu-, \"to hear\". *Virno ===Theonyms=== *Anzotica.
