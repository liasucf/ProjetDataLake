    "text": "Hamberg Glacier () is one of the major glaciers in King Christian X Land, Northeast Greenland. Administratively it lies in the Northeast Greenland National Park zone. The area where the glacier flows is remote and uninhabited. ==History== This glacier was first mapped in 1932 by Lauge Koch during the Three-year Expedition to East Greenland. It was named after Swedish mineralogist, geographer and Arctic explorer Axel Hamberg (1863\u20131933). ==Geography== The Hamberg Glacier flows from the eastern side of the Greenland ice sheet in the west and swings to the NE to join Gerard de Geer Glacier. To the northwest of the bend lies J. L. Mowinckel Land. To the SE the glacier has a branch joining the Jaette Glacier. The Evers Glacier flows about to the north and the Victor Madsen Glacier about to the southeast. Louise Boyd Land lies to the east of the eastern section of the glacier and Fraenkel Land further to the southeast. There is a small region of nunataks off the upper western section of the glacier.A.
