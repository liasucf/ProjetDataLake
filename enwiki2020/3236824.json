    "text": "Sads (typeset as sads and formerly as SADS) is originally a punk rock, post- punk and glam rock band formed in Japan in 1999. The band made its debut with the single \"Tokyo\". They released nine singles and five albums before their disbandment in 2003. In 2010, Sads reformed with a more hard rock/heavy metal sound and signed to the Avex label. They have since released two albums and one single. ==History== Sads was formed by Kiyoharu, vocalist of the disbanded Kuroyume, in May 1999 and at the same time formed his own record label \"Full Face\". Their first live tour was held in the United Kingdom. Kiyoharu has said that the decision to tour internationally from the very beginning was to test Sads' ability to \"compete worldwide\". Their first album, Sad Blood Rock'n'Roll, was a continuation of the bare-bones punk and garage rock from the last Kuroyume album, Corkscrew. Sads eventually delved more into glam rock and post-punk territory as their releases progressed. In early 2010, Kiyoharu announced that Sads and Kuroyume would be resuming activities again, though the other original members of Sads would not be returning; instead, the band now included K-A-Z, the guitarist of the band Detrox, Keisuke Kubota, support bassist for the band 30size, and Go, leader and drummer of the band Suns Owl. They released their first album since reforming, The 7 Deadly Sins, on July 7, 2010. Their official fanclub was originally called \"Rubbersole\", but was renamed \"VIP\" after reforming in 2010. ==Members== ===Current members=== * Kiyoharu \u2013 vocals (1999-2003, 2010\u2013present) (Kuroyume) * K-A-Z - guitar (2010\u2013present) (ex:Detrox, Raglaia) * Go - drums (2010\u2013present) (Suns Owl, Zigoku Quartet) * Yutaro - bass (2017\u2013present) (Underv\u00e1r, ex:Jelly\u2192, ex:Laid Back Ocean) ===Former members=== * Taketomo Sakashita \u2013 guitar (1999-2003) (The Dust 'n' Bonez, Bad Six Babies, The Slut Banks) * Masaru Kobayashi \u2013 bass (2000-2003) (Nil, The Cro-Magnons) * Tetsuhiro Tanuma - bass (1999) * Eiji Mitsuzono - drums (2001-2003) (The Dust 'n' Bonez, Ex:Wild Flag, Bow Wow, The Slut Banks) * Masahiro Muta - drums (1999-2001) * Keisuke Kubota - bass (2010-2017) (ex:Hayabusa Jones, Ohio101) ==Discography== ===Albums=== * Sad Blood Rock 'n' Roll (September 2, 1999) * Babylon (June 7, 2000) * The Rose God Gave Me (August 29, 2001) * \u201c \u201d(untitled) (April 12, 2002) * 13 (March 26, 2003) * Greatest Hits ~Best Of 5 Years~ (July 9, 2003) * The Rose God Gave Me L.A.
