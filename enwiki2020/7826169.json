He was appointed Assistant Professor of Philosophy there in 1963, and became Professor in 1969. From 1975 until his death, he was Distinguished Professor of Philosophy and Linguistics at the City University of New York. Within linguistics, Katz is best known for his theory of semantics in generative grammar, which he refers to as the autonomous theory of sense (ATS).Jerrold J. Katz Sense, Reference, and Philosophy, Oxford University Press, 2004 Katz was a staunch defender of rationalism (although not in a Cartesian/Fregean sense) and the metaphysical import of \"essences\". He argued extensively against the dominance of empiricism. Katz also argued, against W. V. O. Quine, that the analytic\u2013synthetic distinction could be founded on syntactical features of sentences.Linsky, J. Analytical/Synthetic and Semantic TheoryQuine, W. V.
