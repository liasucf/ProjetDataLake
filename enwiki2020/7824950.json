    "text": "Computer-based mathematics education (CBME) is an approach to teaching mathematics that emphasizes the use of computers. == Computers in math education == Computers are used in education in a number of ways, such as interactive tutorials, hypermedia, simulations and educational games. Tutorials are types of software that present information, check learning by question/answer method, judge responses, and provide feedback. Educational games are more like simulations and are used from the elementary to college level. E learning systems can deliver math lessons and exercises and manage homework assignments. ==See also== *ALEKS, a computer-based education system that includes mathematics among its curricula *Computer-Based Math, a project aimed at using computers for computational tasks and spending more classroom time on applications *Mathletics (educational software), a popular K-12 mathematics learning program from 3P Learning *Mathspace, a similar program for students aged 7-18, founded in Australia in 2010 ==References== Category:Mathematics education Category:Educational math software ",
