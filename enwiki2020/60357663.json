His name is also given as Henri Maupercher and Henri Montpercher. Most of his landscapes are capriccios. ==Biography== He was a student of Daniel Rabel. In 1634, he went to Rome with Louis Boullogne, where he associated with S\u00e9bastien Bourdon and a group of painters known as the . He returned to Paris in 1639, where he was commissioned to paint decorations in the guard room and antechamber of the Palais-Cardinal; the residence of Cardinal Richelieu. In 1645, he married Magdeleine Garnot. From 1646 to 1647, he worked on decorating the \"Cabinet de l'Amour\" at the H\u00f4tel Lambert, along with the landscape painters Pierre Patel, Jan Asselyn and Herman van Swanevelt. In 1648, he became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et de sculpture and was named a Professor in 1655, which was an unusual honor for a landscape painter. Together with Laurent de La Hyre, he helped to popularize the classical landscape style of Claude Lorrain. Having become famous for his decorations, he undertook to paint the apartments of Queen Anne of Austria at Fontainebleau. As with the H\u00f4tel Lambert, the greater part of those works have disappeared. His wife died in 1671. By 1686, he was too ill to attend sessions of the Acad\u00e9mie, and was excused. He died at the end of that year. ==Source== * Bernard Biard; \"Henri Mauperch\u00e9, paysagiste au long cours\", in, L\u2019Objet d\u2019Art, #316, September 1997, pgs.31-41 ==External links== Category:1600s births Category:1686 deaths Category:French painters Category:French landscape painters Category:17th- century French painters ",
