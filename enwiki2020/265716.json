The city is located in the Northern Dobruja region of Romania, on the Black Sea coast. It is the capital of Constan\u021ba County and the largest city in the historical region of Dobruja. As of the 2011 census, Constan\u021ba has a population of 283,872, making it the fifth most populous city in Romania. The Constan\u021ba metropolitan area includes 14 localities within of the city, and with a total population of 425,916 inhabitants, it is one of the largest metropolitan areas in Romania. The Port of Constan\u021ba has an area of and a length of about . It is the largest port on the Black Sea, and one of the largest ports in Europe. ==History== According to Jordanes (after Cassiodorus), the foundation of the city was ascribed to Tomyris, the queen of the Massagetae (the origin and deeds of the Goths): :\"After achieving this victory (against Cyrus the Great) and winning so much booty from her enemies, Queen Tomyris crossed over into that part of Moesia which is now called Lesser Scythia - a name borrowed from Great Scythia -, and built on the Moesian shore of the Black Sea the city of Tomi, named after herself.\" Ruins of Tomis In 29 BC, the Romans captured the region from the Odryses, and annexed it as far as the Danube, under the name of Limes Scythicus (\"Scythian Frontier\"). In AD 8, the Roman poet Ovid (43 BC-17) was banished here by Augustus and it was where he spent the remaining eight years of his life. He laments his exile in Tomis in his poems: Tristia and Epistulae ex Ponto. Tomis was \"by his account a town located in a war-stricken cultural wasteland on the remotest margins of the empire\".The Cambridge Companion to Ovid ed. Philip Hardie p.235. Casino after the occupation of the port of Constan\u021ba by Soviet sailors in 1944. Statue of Ovid in front of the Museum of National History A statue of Ovid stands in the Ovid Square (Pia\u021ba Ovidiu) of Constan\u021ba, in front of the History Museum (the former City Hall). A number of inscriptions found in the city and its vicinity show that Constan\u021ba lies where Tomis once stood. Some of these are now preserved in the British Museum in London. The city was afterwards included in the Province of Moesia, and, from the time of Diocletian, in Scythia Minor, of which it was the metropolis. After the 5th century, Tomis fell under the rule of the Eastern Roman Empire. During Maurice's Balkan campaigns, Tomis was besieged by the Avars in the winter of 597/598. Tomis was later renamed to Constantiana in honour of Constantia, the half-sister of Roman Emperor Constantine the Great (274-337). The earliest known usage of this name was \"\u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\" (\"Constantia\") in 950. The city lay at the seaward end of the Great Wall of Trajan, and has evidently been surrounded by fortifications of its own. After successively becoming part of the Bulgarian Empire for over 500 years, and later of the independent principality of Dobrotitsa/Dobrotici and of Wallachia under Mircea I of Wallachia, Constan\u021ba fell under the Ottoman rule around 1419. Constan\u021ba panorama in 1910 Constan\u021ba Prefecture (nowadays the Constan\u021ba Military Circle) damaged during city's occupation by the Central Powers (19161918) The port of Constan\u021ba in 1941 A railroad linking Constan\u021ba to Cernavod\u0103 was opened in 1860. In spite of damage done by railway contractors there are considerable remains of ancient masonry walls, pillars, etc. An impressive public building, thought to have originally been a port building, has been excavated, and contains the substantial remains of one of the longest mosaic pavements in the world. In 1878, after the Romanian War of Independence, Constan\u021ba and the rest of Northern Dobruja were ceded by the Ottoman Empire to Romania. The city became Romania's main seaport and transit point for much of Romania's exports. The Constan\u021ba Casino, which is both a historic monument and a modern symbol of the city, was the first building constructed on the shore of the Black Sea after Dobruja came under Romanian administration, with the cornerstone being laid in 1880. On October 22, 1916 (during World War I), the Central Powers (German, Turkish and Bulgarian troops) occupied Constan\u021ba. According to the Treaty of Bucharest of May 1918, article X.b. (a treaty never ratified by Romania), Constan\u021ba remained under the joint control of the Central Powers. Allied troops liberated the city in 1918 after the successful offensive on the Macedonian front knocked Bulgaria out of the war. In the interwar years, the city became Romania's main commercial hub, so that by the 1930s over half of the national exports were going through the port. During World War II, when Romania joined the Axis powers, Constan\u021ba was one of the country's main targets for the Allied bombers. While the town was left relatively unscathed, the port suffered extensive damage, recovering only in the early 1950s. ==Geography== Constan\u021ba is the administrative center of the county with the same name and the largest city in the EU Southeastern development region of Romania. The city is located on the Black Sea coast, having a beach length of . Mamaia, an administrative district of Constan\u021ba, is the largest and most modern resort on the Romanian coast.

Drawing by Camille Allard View toward Constan\u021ba shipyard As of 1878, Constan\u021ba was defined as a \"poor Turkish fishing village.\" As of 1920, it was called \"flourishing\", and was known for exporting oil and cereals. Constan\u021ba is one of Romania's main industrial, commercial and tourist centers. During the first half of 2008, some 3,144 new companies were established in Constan\u021ba and its neighbouring localities, a number surpassed only in Bucharest and Cluj County. The Port of Constan\u021ba is the largest on the Black Sea and the fourth largest in Europe. The city also boasts a comparably large shipyard. Tourism has been an increasingly important economic activity in recent years. Although Constan\u021ba has been promoted as a seaside resort since the time of Carol I, the development of naval industry had a detrimental effect on the city's beaches. Nevertheless, due to its proximity to other major tourist destinations, Constan\u021ba receives a significant number of visitors every year, who discover and visit the city's monuments and attractions. Also, Constan\u021ba is a centre of commerce and education, both of which significantly contribute to the local economy. ==Transport== A2 motorway, also known as \"Sun's Highway\" The opening, in 1895, of the railway to Bucharest, which crosses the Danube River at the bridge at Cernavod\u0103, brought Constan\u021ba considerable transit trade in grain and petroleum, which are largely exported; coal and coke head the list of imports, followed by machinery, iron goods, and cotton and woollen fabrics. The A2 motorway provides a rapid road link between Constan\u021ba and Bucharest, while the A4 motorway acts as the city's outer traffic ring, diverting heavy traffic to and from the Port of Constan\u021ba and to Mangalia. The Port of Constan\u021ba includes the North Port and the South Port, and is the fourth largest in Europe. It is protected by breakwaters, with a lighthouse at the entrance. The port is sheltered from the northerly winds, but southerly winds can prove highly dangerous at times. The Black Sea squadron of the Romanian fleet is stationed here. A large canal (the Danube-Black Sea Canal) connects the Danube River to the Black Sea at Constan\u021ba. The city is served by Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu International Airport. MAZ buses, running on Route 44 Constan\u021ba's public transport system is run by Regia Autonom\u0103 de Transport \u00een Comun Constan\u021ba (RATC), and consists of 23 year-round bus lines, and one summer sightseeing double decker open top bus line to tourists. In the early 2000s, the city bought 130 new MAZ buses to replace the aging fleet of DAC buses. The entire fleet is now made up of buses from the 2000-2008 period, which are painted in distinctive bright colors, such as pink, yellow and green. There is also a fleet of double decker Volvo buses that run in the summer, providing access to and from the resort of Mamaia. As of October 2013, the cost of a return ticket is 3 lei. Trams were active until the early 2000s. By this time, however, the cars were almost 25 years old and with the difficulties in maintenance, were decommissioned in favour of long-wheelbase buses. Two trolley bus lines were active until the late 2000s - now also decommissioned and replaced by buses. At the end of March 2014, all public buses were upgraded with Wi-Fi for free use by all passengers. Speeds fall into the 3G HSDPA mobile range. Also, as an upgrade to the ticketing system, since the same time, tickets and per day all bus lines subscriptions can be bought via SMS, accepted by all national operators. In July 2018 Constan\u021ba municipality signed an \u20ac18 million-contract to acquire new buses manufactured by the Turkish company Anadolu Isuzu. There are also plenty of private minibuses (similar to a share taxi) which run along longer and more intricate lines. The price of a minibus ticket, as of October 2013, varies between 1 and 2 lei depending on the operator. ==Tourism== Situated at the crossroads of several commercial routes, Constan\u021ba lies on the western coast of the Black Sea, from the Bosphorus Strait. An ancient metropolis and Romania's largest sea port, Constan\u021ba traces its history some 2,500 years. Originally called Tomis, legend has it that Jason landed here with the Argonauts after finding the Golden Fleece. One of the largest cities in Romania, Constan\u021ba is now an important cultural and economic center, worth exploring for its archaeological treasures and the atmosphere of the old town center. Its historical monuments, ancient ruins, grand Casino, museums and shops, and proximity to beach resorts make it the focal point of Black Sea coast tourism. Open-air restaurants, nightclubs and cabarets offer a wide variety of entertainment. Regional attractions include traditional villages, vineyards, ancient monuments and the Danube Delta, the best preserved delta in Europe. The National History and Archaeology Museum is located in the old City Hall and has a very large collection of ancient art. ===Main sights=== The Casino at sunset The Genoese Lighthouse Details from the House with Lions Carol I Mosque, Constan\u021ba is the centre of Islam in Romania.

The building combines Byzantine and Romanian architectural elements, making it one of the most distinctive mosques in the area. The centerpiece of the interior is a large Turkish carpet, a gift from Sultan Abdul Hamid. Woven at the Hereke Handicraft Center in Turkey, it is one of the largest carpets in Europe, weighing 1,080 pounds.
