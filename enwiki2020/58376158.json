Russwurm was born in Frauenbreitungen, Sachsen-Meiningen, the son of Heinrich Russwurm the Younger and his wife Dorothea, probably in August 1565.Sch., Ru\u00dfworm, Hermann Christof Graf von, in Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, vol. 30 (1890), pp. 16-19. He began his military career in the Cologne War (1583\u201388), by the end of which he had become commander of Christophe de Bassompierre's personal guard. In 1590 he entered on his inheritance, and became an officer in the regiment of Hans Reichard von Sch\u00f6nberg, serving in J\u00fclich. Distinguishing himself in command, he received an imperial commission as lieutenant colonel and instructions to raise a regiment for Charles, Margrave of Burgau, to serve against the Turks. He was wounded at the Siege of P\u00e1pa in 1597. In Autumn 1600, at a banquet in Prague, he unsuccessfully sought to provoke the Moravian nobleman Charles of \u017derot\u00edn the Elder into a duel.Tom\u00e1\u0161 Knoz, \"Culture, Politics, and Law in the Lives of Charles of \u017derot\u00edn the Elder and the Moravian Nobility\", in Between Lipany and White Mountain: Essays in Late Medieval and Early Modern Bohemian History in Modern Czech Scholarship, edited by James R. Palmitessa, translated by Barbara Day and Christopher Hopkinson (Leuden, 2014), p. 239. Russwurm commanded the imperial forces in failed attempts on Buda in 1602 and 1603.Ferenc Szak\u00e1ly, \"The Early Ottoman Period, Including Royal Hungary, 1526-1606\", in A History of Hungary, edited by Peter F.

On 24 July he became embroiled in a quarrel in which one of his servants killed Marshal Belgiojoso's brother. Tried as an accessory to the killing, he was beheaded in Prague on 29 November 1605, against the wishes of the Emperor Rudolf II. ==References== Category:1605 deaths Category:People of the Long Turkish War Category:Year of birth uncertain ",
