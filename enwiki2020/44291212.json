Her works explore various themes, such as identity, cultural heritage, terrorism, tikkun olam, as well as the spiritual concepts of kabbalah. Verwer holds a master's degree in Fine Art from the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague. Her recent work explores architecture and communities. Using the resources of inventive new technology, and based on research of archival photos, documents and artifacts, she connects Jewish architecture with its old world origins.
