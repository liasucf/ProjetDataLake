    "text": "This article is one of a series providing information about endemism among birds in the world's various zoogeographic zones. For an overview of this subject see Endemism in birds. == Patterns of endemism == This region is notable not just for the high number of endemic species, but for endemism in higher-level taxonomic groupings too. === Order-level endemism === Two orders are endemic to Madagascar or the wider region: * Mesites are placed within the Mesitornithiformes, an order containing three species in two genera. * The cuckoo-roller is placed in the monotypic order Leptosomiformes. It is endemic to the wider region, as its single species is present on both Madagascar and Comores. === Family-level endemism === The following three families are endemic to Madagascar: * Ground-rollers, a family within the Coraciiformes, containing five species in three genera. * Asities, a passerine family within the Old World suboscines, containing four species in two genera * Malagasy Warblers, a passerine family within the Old World oscines, containing eleven species in eight genera. One other family is endemic to the wider region: * The vangas, an oscine passerine family, containing sixteen species in eleven genera are endemic to the region. All but one species are confined to Madagascar, the sole exception being the Comoro blue vanga, restricted to Comores. === Subfamily-level endemism === * The nine species of coua (genus Coua, a subfamily of the cuckoos) are all Madagascan endemics. * Two extinct species, the dodo of Mauritius and Rodrigues solitaire of Rodrigues are placed in the Raphinae (a subfamily of the doves and pigeons). === Genus-level endemism === In addition to genera in the families above, the following genera are endemic to the region (M indicating a genus endemic to Madagascar): * the jeries Neomixis (three species) and Hartertula (one species) M In addition in the following genera, high proportions of the member species are endemic to Madagascar: * the rock-thrushes, Monticola, in which three of the 13 species are endemic to Madagascar (these three are sometimes separated into their own genus, Pseudocossyphus). == Endemic Bird Areas == BirdLife International has defined a number of Endemic Bird Areas and Secondary Areas in Madagascar and the western Indian Ocean islands. == List of species == === Species endemic to Madagascar === The following is a list of species endemic to Madagascar.
