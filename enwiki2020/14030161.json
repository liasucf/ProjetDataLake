    "text": "John Varah Long (28 September 1826, in Wickersley, England \u2013 14 April 1869) was a clerk for Brigham Young, the first governor of Utah Territory and the second president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also known as LDS Church). On November 1, 2007, KTVX, a Salt Lake City television station, announced that a number of his diaries and letters related to his position had surfaced. These records appear likely to reveal a great amount of additional historical perspective and detail with regard to both the views and doings of Young, as well as added insight into the early operations of various aspects of the LDS Church. ==References== *\"ABC 4 Investigation: Decoding Brigham Young's pioneer past\", ABC-4, Utah4.com, November 1, 2007 *John Varah Long at RootsWeb *Hance, Irma Watson. \"A Biographical Sketch of John Varah Long: His Diaries, Writings, Lectures and Notes.\" ACCN 278, Special Collections, Marriott Library. *Sanders, Ken and Bagley, Will.
