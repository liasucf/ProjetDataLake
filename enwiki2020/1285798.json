    "text": "The Oncidiinae is a subtribe within the Orchidaceae that consists of a number of genera that are closely related. This subtribe consists of about 70 genera with over 1000 species, with Oncidium as its largest genus. These genera consist of a single floral type based on the angle of the attachment of the lip to the column, reflecting pollinator preferences. This has however led to several unreliable results and polyphyletic taxa within Oncidium. These were transferred to Gomesa and a new genus Nohawilliamsia, has been described for Oncidium orthostates Most Oncidioid species have well-developed pseudobulbs and conduplicate leaves. It is possible to form hybrids in some instances between multiple genera within the Oncidiinae. These hybrids are often colloquially referred to as \"intergenerics.\" ==Genera== Primary genera include: * Ada * Aspasia * Brassia * Comparettia * Fernandezia * Gomesa * Lockhartia * Macradenia * Macrochilus * Macroclinium * Mexicoa * Miltonia * Miltoniopsis * Notylia * Odontoglossum * Oncidium * Osmoglossum * Otoglossum * Plectrophora * Polyotidium * Psychopsiella (sometimes included in Psychopsis) * Psychopsis * Psygmorchis * Pterostemma * Quekettia * Rodriguezia * Trichocentrum * Trichopilia Orchid Odontonia Prism Picotee \u00d7 Crystal Palace Orchid Odontonia Prism Picotee \u00d7 Crystal Palace, viewed from further out == References == * Mark W.
