She is finally given a chance to prove herself thanks to Godmother Judy (Kurtz), who hires her to work in a library. ==Marketing and reception== Marketing of the series centered around Taylor's recent popularity portraying Marcia Brady in The Brady Bunch Movie. One television commercial featured a parody of the opening/closing credits of The Brady Bunch, but Taylor appeared (as Mary) in each box. Although six episodes were filmed, only four were aired and the show was quickly cancelled. ==Cast== * Christine Taylor as Mary * Swoosie Kurtz as Judy Burkhard * John Cameron Mitchell as Derrick * Merrin Dungey as Wanda * Matt Borlenghi as Oneal ==Episodes== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"background:#fff;\" |- ! style=\"background:#;\"| No. ! style=\"background:#;\"| Title ! style=\"background:#;\"| Directed by ! style=\"background:#;\"| Written by ! style=\"background:#;\"| Original air date |} ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1990s American sitcoms Category:1996 American television series debuts Category:1996 American television series endings Category:English- language television shows Category:Fox Broadcasting Company original programming Category:Live action television shows based on films Category:Television series by Warner Bros.
