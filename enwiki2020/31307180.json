    "text": "{| |} The S-Wing Swing (called the S-wing Aircraft Swing 06 in the United States) is a high-wing, two-seat, single-engine ultralight/light sport aircraft designed and built in the Czech Republic.Bayerl, Robby; Martin Berkemeier; et al: World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2011-12, page 74. WDLA UK, Lancaster UK, 2011. ISSN 1368-485X ==Design and development== The Swing is a conventionally laid out ultralight/LSA aircraft with a single engine and high wing. The composite parts are built using a vacuum technology producing a sandwich structure. The fuel tank, engine mount and lift struts use melamine composites. The constant chord wings, carrying 3\u00b0 of dihedral, are built from GRP composite with hard leading edges and fabric elsewhere. Each wing has a single lift strut with a short auxiliary strut joining it near the wing. The wings carry GRP mass-balanced ailerons and three-position plain flaps.Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16, page 78. Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. The fin of the Swing has a strongly swept leading edge and a nearly upright rudder. Early versions had an all moving, though braced, tailplane mounted about halfway up the fin but more recently this has been replaced by a fuselage mounted tailplane. Narrow near the tail, the fuselage increases in diameter to the cabin, placed under the wings. Cockpit width is . The cockpit features bulged, glazed doors to improve visibility and room. Dual controls are standard, the seating side by side. The early Swings were powered by either 60 kW (80 hp) Rotax 912 UL flat-four engine or the two-stroke twin-cylinder 49 kW (65 hp) Rotax 582 UL, driving propellers with two or more blades. Current (2010) aircraft have the 74 kW (99 hp) Rotax 912 ULS flat-four with a two-bladed propeller. The Swing has a fixed undercarriage, which may be of either tricycle or tailwheel configuration. The aircraft has been accepted in the United States as a special light-sport aircraft. ==Operational history== Swings were produced for the Czech market until around 1997. Eleven had been sold by the time it became available in the United States from 2007. Thirteen had been produced by mid-2010. Three appear on the European (excluding Russian) civil registers, all in the Czech Republic. ==Specifications== ==References== ==External links== * Category:1990s Czech and Czechoslovakian ultralight aircraft ",
