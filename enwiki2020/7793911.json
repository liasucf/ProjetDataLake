Its cathedral is Sacred Heart Syro-Malabar Cathedral, Rajkot. ==History== On 16 July 2010, Pope Benedict XVI named Mar Jose Chittooparambil as the bishop of the Syro-Malabar Catholic eparchy of Rajkot. The bishop-elect was born in 1954 in Neeleswaram, India, was ordained to the priesthood in 1985, and is currently Prior General of St. Xavier's Province in Rajkot. He succeeds bishop Mar Gregory Karotemprel, whose resignation the Pope accepted upon having reached the age limit. (All bishops of local churches, or dioceses, whose wider churches are in communion with the Pope, must submit their resignation for possible acceptance at age 75, though the resignations are usually only accepted later.) == Former bishops == * Mar Jonas Thaliath * Mar Gregory Karotemprel == Schools == * St. Xavier's High School, Bhuj ==External links== *Syro-Malabar Catholic Diocese of Rajkot Catholic-Hierarchy Category:Syro- Malabar Catholic dioceses Category:Eastern Catholic dioceses in India Category:Christian organizations established in 1977 Category:Christianity in Gujarat Category:1977 establishments in India ",
