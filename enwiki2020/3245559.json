    "text": "Ocimenes are a group of isomeric hydrocarbons. The ocimenes are monoterpenes found within a variety of plants and fruits. \u03b1-Ocimene and the two \u03b2-ocimenes differ in the position of the isolated double bond: it is terminal in the alpha isomer. \u03b1-Ocimene is cis-3,7-dimethyl-1,3,7-octatriene. \u03b2-Ocimene is trans-3,7-dimethyl-1,3,6-octatriene. \u03b2-Ocimene exists in two stereoisomeric forms, cis and trans, with respect to the central double bond. The ocimenes are often found naturally as mixtures of the various forms. The mixture, as well as the pure compounds, are oils with a pleasant odor. They are used in perfumery for their sweet herbal scent, and are believed to act as plant defense and have anti-fungal properties.SCLabs, Beyond Aroma: Terpenes in cannabis Like the related acyclic terpene myrcene, ocimenes are unstable in air.Karl-Georg Fahlbusch, Franz-Josef Hammerschmidt, Johannes Panten, Wilhelm Pickenhagen, Dietmar Schatkowski, Kurt Bauer, Dorothea Garbe, Horst Surburg \"Flavors and Fragrances\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Like other terpenes, the ocimenes are nearly insoluble in water, but soluble in common organic solvents. The name is derived from the plant genus name Ocimum from the Ancient Greek word for basil, (\u1e53kimon). == References == Category:Perfume ingredients Category:Monoterpenes Category:Polyenes ",
