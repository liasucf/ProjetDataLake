    "text": "Tymovirus is a genus of viruses in the order Tymovirales, in the family Tymoviridae. Plants serve as natural hosts. There are currently 28 species in this genus including the type species Turnip yellow mosaic virus. ==Taxonomy== Group: ssRNA(+) ==Structure== Viruses in Tymovirus are non-enveloped, with icosahedral and isometric geometries, and T=3 symmetry. The diameter is around 30 nm. Genomes are linear, around 6.3kb in length. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! Genus !! Structure || Symmetry !! Capsid !!

Entry into the host cell is achieved by penetration into the host cell. Replication follows the positive stranded RNA virus replication model. Positive stranded RNA virus transcription is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by leaky scanning. The virus exits the host cell by monopartite non-tubule guided viral movement. Plants serve as the natural host. The virus is transmitted via a vector (insects). Transmission routes are vector and mechanical. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
