    "text": "Providence Health & Services is a non-profit, Catholic health care system operating multiple hospitals across eight states, with headquarters in Renton, Washington. The health system includes 51 hospitals, more than 800 non-acute facilities and numerous other health, supportive housing and educational services in the states of the United States West Coast (Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California) and Montana, New Mexico, and Texas. Providence Health & Services was founded by the Sisters of Providence in 1859. ==History== Providence Health System was established by the Sisters of Providence, a community of Roman Catholic sisters founded in Montreal, Quebec by Mother \u00c9milie Gamelin in 1843. In 1856, Mother Joseph and four sisters came to Vancouver, Washington (then Washington Territory) to serve the native people and settlers. In 1859, the Sisters incorporated their work, creating the network of health care services known as Providence Health & Services. In 1891, they founded St. Elizabeth Hospital, the Pacific Northwest's first permanent hospital (now PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center). The sisters later established several schools and hospitals in Washington, Montana, Oregon, Alaska, British Columbia, and California. Providence Health System was managed by the Sisters of Providence until 1979 when a secular president was appointed. In 2003, Health Management Associates purchased the Providence Health System properties in Central Washington including Providence Yakima Medical Center (formerly St. Elizabeth) and Toppenish Hospital. In 2012, Providence acquired Swedish Health Services in Seattle, Washington. Dr. Rod Hochman, CEO of Swedish Medical Center was hired by Providence Health & Services when Providence affiliated with Swedish in 2012. In April 2013, Dr. Hochman became the president and CEO of Providence. In 2014, Providence entered in an affiliation with Pacific Medical Centers (PacMed). PacMed joined Swedish as part of Providence's Western HealthConnect division. The Providence Medical Group operates more than 250 clinics in neighborhoods throughout Alaska, California, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington. Providence Medical Group is part of Providence Health & Services. Providence Medical Group employs more than 1,600 physicians offering expertise in family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, dermatology and other specialties. Providence Health & Services provides outpatient services, transitional care, home and hospice care, substance abuse programs, mental health treatment, prevention and wellness programs, long-term care, and assisted living and housing. Providence Health Plan provides or administers health coverage to more than 375,000 members nationwide. ===Sponsorship=== In 2014, Providence signed a sponsorship deal with the Portland Timbers of Major League Soccer, naming Timbers' stadium Providence Park. ===Environmental initiatives=== The company has a program in place designed to reduce the amount of food scraps that it sends to landfills. The program focuses on more accurate food purchasing and preparation practices, composting food scraps and donating edible food to nonprofits. Providence requires the chefs throughout its system to use centrally developed recipes and portion sizes that are designed to reduce waste and improve the nutritional value of the food served. In 2016, the company said, its program helped divert 204 tons of food waste from the landfill. == Controversies == In 2018, Providence paid its chief executive, Rod Hochman, more than $10 million. In 2020, Providence Health System had a nearly $12 billion cash reserve and obtained $509 million in government funds earmarked to prevent health care providers from going under during the coronavirus pandemic. The normal annual yield for the reserve fund nets approximately $1 billion in profits per year. == Hospitals == ===Alaska=== *Providence Alaska Medical Center *Providence Kodiak Island Medical Center *Providence Seward Medical and Care Center *Providence Valdez Medical Center ===California=== Providence Tarzana Medical Center *Providence Holy Cross Medical Center *Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center (San Pedro) *Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center (Torrance) *Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center *Providence Tarzana Medical Center *Providence Medical Institute *Providence Saint John's Health Center ===Idaho=== *Providence Hospital ===Montana=== *St. Joseph Medical Center *St. Patrick Hospital and Health Sciences Center ===New Mexico=== *University of New Mexico Hospital ===Oregon=== Providence Newberg Medical Center *Providence Hood River Memorial Hospital *Providence Medford Medical Center *Providence Milwaukie Hospital *Providence Newberg Medical Center *Providence Portland Medical Center *Providence Seaside Hospital *Providence St. Vincent Medical Center *Providence Willamette Falls Medical Center ===Washington=== Providence St. Peter Hospital in Olympia *Providence Centralia Hospital *Providence Holy Family Hospital *Providence Mount Carmel Hospital *Providence Regional Medical Center Everett *Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center and Children's Hospital *Providence St. Joseph's Hospital * Providence St. Mary Medical Center *Providence St. Peter Hospital ===Texas=== *Covenant Medical Center - Lubbock *Covenant Children's Hospital - Lubbock *Grace Medical Center - Lubbock *Covenant Health Plainview *Covenant Health Levelland ==References== ==External links== * Providence Health & Services (official website) * Providence Archives (official archives) Category:Catholic health care Category:Companies based in Renton, Washington Category:Healthcare in Washington (state) Category:Hospital networks in the United States Category:Companies established in 1859 Category:1859 establishments in Washington Territory Category:Medical and health organizations based in Washington (state) ",
