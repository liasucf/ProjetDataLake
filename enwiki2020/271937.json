    "text": "Maharishi International University (MIU), formerly Maharishi University of Management, is a private university in Fairfield, Iowa. It was founded in 1973 by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and features a \"consciousness-based education\" system that includes the practice of the Transcendental Meditation technique. Its founding principles include the development of the full potential of the individual, fulfilling economic aspirations while maximizing proper use of the environment and bringing spiritual fulfillment and happiness to humanity. The university is regionally accredited through the doctoral level by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) and offers degree programs in art, business, education, communications, mathematical science, literature, physiology & health, Vedic Science and sustainable living. The original campus was located in Goleta, California, and in 1974 moved to the current 370-acre campus in Fairfield, Iowa. During the 1990s many older buildings were demolished and replaced using green technology and the principles of ancient Vedic architecture. The university features an academic \"block system\" (only one subject for four weeks) and a diverse, multinational student body. It is said to offer an organic, vegetarian food program.Dorfman, Josh (2007) Harry N. Abrams Inc., The Lazy Environmentalist: Your Guide to Easy, Stylish, Green Living, Chapter 21 ==History== ===1971\u20132004=== University sign at campus entrance The concept for a university came out of a \"series of international symposia on Science of Creative Intelligence\" (SCI) attended by notable academics.Jefferson, William (1976) Pocket Books, The Story of The Maharishi, pp. 118\u2013123 It was established in 1971 by Nat Goldhaber. It was created with the belief that a school that incorporated the \"philosophy and techniques of Transcendental Meditation\" would create an \"unusual contribution to higher education\". It was inaugurated by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and Robert Keith Wallace assumed his position as the first university president in 1973. Its first location was an apartment complex in Goleta, California. The university enrolled 700 students during its first year of operation. In August 1974, the university purchased the campus of the bankrupt Parsons College in Fairfield, Iowa, for $2.5 million and relocated there.Engel, Allison, \"Maharishi International University mixes meditation and education\", Change Vol 7 No 4 (May 1975) p. 19Nelson, Bryce (July 9, 1973) \"The Death of a College\u2014Grand Idea That Failed\", Los Angeles Times, The college trustees asked for protection of the federal court under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act. In his order, the federal bankruptcy judge, Richard Stageman, admitted \"the affection and esteem\" in which Iowans held the college but said that it was irretrievably insolvent\" Aerial photograph of the MIU campus In 1975, the freshman and sophomore years consisted of interdisciplinary studies, and were organized in a modular format, with each course lasting a few weeks or months. All students, regardless of their previous education, were required to attend 24 interdisciplinary courses, some of which consisted of pre-recorded video tapes of \"resident faculty\" who were not on campus, while graduate students and teaching assistants played the video tapes and conducted discussions. Nobel Prize winner Melvin Calvin said that, even though he participated in a symposium on SCI, the use of his name in the MIU catalogue was \"perilously close to false advertising\". John Lewis, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who created video-taped lectures for MIU, was supportive, saying that TM \"unblocks the student's pathways to education\". During this period, an open admissions policy was instituted, and transfer students were welcomed regardless of their academic history. In 1976, the accreditation evaluation team from the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools said the 19 senior and 20 assistant faculty were \"creative in their vision for higher education and eminently qualified\", and the university was granted \"candidate for accreditation\" status. At that time, faculty and administrators were paid \"approximately the same base salary of $275 per month\", with additional compensation \"on a sliding scale for those with spouses and children\", plus free housing in university dormitories.Maeroff, Gene I., \"College in Iowa flourishes on meditation\", The New York Times (May 18, 1976) p. 16 Reprinted On campus, drugs and alcohol were \"shunned\" and a \"strong sense of community\" was said to pervade the institution. Bevan Morris was appointed president and chairman of Maharishi International University's board of trustees in 1979. The following year, the university received accreditation through the doctoral level by the Higher Learning Commission, and became a member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCACS).Kapur, Kamlesh (2010) Sterling Publishers, History Of Ancient India (Portraits Of A Nation), pp. 462\u2013463 1981 saw the completion of two 20,000 square foot meditation buildings called Golden Domes, that were built on campus for daily group practice of the Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi programs.Magician Mixes Marriage and Meditation; The Hour (Associated Press) Norwalk, CT, December 2, 1981 By this time the Henn Mansion, Trustee Gymnasium and Ballard Hall buildings, built in the early 1900s, showed rapid deterioration. These buildings were scheduled to be demolished but the university spent $500,000 to restore Henn Mansion, starting 1984, and nominated six other buildings for the National Historic Register.Goff, Rory and Rena (November 2012) Remembering Barhydt Chapel, Iowa Source, page F-1 In July 1983, the Argus-Press reported that competing meditation seminar teacher, Robin Woodsworth Carlsen, had criticized and ridiculed the university in a full-page advertisement placed in a local newspaper and had filed a lawsuit against the university. As a result, \"many students\" who were distributing Carlsen's literature on campus were asked to leave the campus and several were suspended with their meditation dome admission privileges revoked.Munns, Roger, \"Upstart stirring up the karma\", Owosso Argus-Press (Associated Press) (July 21, 1983) In December 1983, the university hosted a three-week \"Taste of Utopia\" conference with more than 7,000 participants and practitioners of the TM-Sidhi program \"from around the world\". MIU president Morris later reported that research data indicated the conference had reduced violence in war-torn areas and inspired an increase in the Dow Jones stock index via the Maharishi Effect.(November 2010)James McCartney to make American debut in Fairfield The Gazette, retrieved April 5, 2012 By 1992, the university had 800 students from more than 70 countries, paying approximately $10,000 a year for their tuition and board. In 1995, Maharishi International University changed its name to Maharishi University of Management (MUM). As part of its master plan to rebuild and expand the campus using natural materials and Maharishi Vastu Architecture design principles, many of the Parsons College buildings, which had high maintenance costs, were demolished, including Foster Hall. In 2019, the name was changed back to the original Maharishi International University. In 2000, local preservationists protested the demolition of Parsons Hall, built in 1915, and Barhydt Chapel, designed in 1911 by Henry K. Holsman. University officials said that MIU would donate the buildings to any community group who could raise the $1 million needed to move what the local newspaper described as an \"ailing building\".Beth Dalby, \"M.U.M. reveals plans for Barhydt Chapel, Fairfield Ledger, November 17, 2000, p. 1 In response to protests the university ensured the survival of the chapel's plaques, pipe organ, and stained glass windows, which are now displayed at the Fairfield Arts & Convention Center. Between 2000 and 2005, the university demolished Carnegie Hall, Parsons Hall (1915), Barhydt Chapel (1911), Blum Stadium (1966), Laser Tower, the dining hall, and 38 dormitory- style \"pods\". Seven student \"residence halls\" with single rooms were completed in 2005 using eco-friendly designs, natural materials and geo-thermal heating. Moby performing in 2008 A stabbing incident occurred in 2004, when MIU student Shuvender Sem attacked two other students in separate incidents on the same day. He stabbed the first student with a pen and, hours later, fatally stabbed Levi Butler with a knife. Sem was found not guilty due to insanity and the university settled a lawsuit that charged it with negligence. ===2005\u2013present=== Beginning in 2005, film director David Lynch hosted an annual \"David Lynch Weekend for World Peace and Meditation\" at MIU. The 2008 event included musical performances by Donovan, Moby, and Chrysta Bell. The fourth annual David Lynch Weekend of November 2009 featured Donovan, MIU professor John Hagelin, and the American debut of James McCartney, who performed at the Fairfield Arts & Convention Center. The weekend conference was intended to appeal to those \"interested in creativity, film, art, sustainable living, organic agriculture, brain development, consciousness, meditation, natural medicine, renewable living [and] peace\".Heartland Connection By 2007, the university had over 45 campus buildings, including 17 classroom and administrative buildings. Between 1974 and 2008, a total of 43 buildings were demolished and 70 new buildings erected in their place. At that time, MIU had 948 students (813 full time) of whom 78% were foreign students - the third-highest number of foreign students at an Iowa university that year. 71% of these students were enrolled in a graduate degree program. The largest age group was 25\u201329 years of age (42%). In this same year, MIU awarded 125 Masters degrees and 34 Bachelor degrees. In 2008, the Argiro Student Center was completed, featuring \"the most advanced green technologies\" and included dining areas, student cafe, book store, interdenominational chapel, auditorium, classrooms, exercise studio and student government offices.People and Places . . .

Two golden domes were erected between 1980 and 1981 and are used for daily group practice of the Transcendental Meditation and the TM-Sidhi program and have been called \"particle accelerators of consciousness\" by the university's founder. The campus was \"thoroughly rebuilt\" in the 1990s and seven student residence halls, with single rooms, were completed in 2005 using eco-friendly designs, natural materials and geo-thermal heating. By 2007, the university had over 45 campus buildings, including 17 classroom and administrative buildings. Between 1974 and 2008, a total of 43 buildings had been demolished and 70 new buildings had been erected in their place.Schuman, Samuel (2009) Johns Hopkins University Press, Seeing the Light: Religious Colleges in Twenty-First-Century America, pp. 39\u201341 The newly-created Dreier Building houses the offices of Admissions, Alumni, Campus Reconstruction, Development, the dean of faculty, the deans of women and men, the Enrollment Center, the executive vice- president, legal counsel, Human Resources, and six classrooms.

In the book, she cites two former professors who in the late 1980s \"testified against the research practices conducted at the university\". In the book, she writes that former MIU professor of economics and business law Anthony DeNaro alleged in 1986 that there was \"a very serious and deliberate pattern of fraud ... designed to misrepresent the TM movement as a science (not a cult), and fraudulently claim and obtain tax exempt status with the IRS\". Williamson writes in her book that Dennis Roark, former dean of faculty and chair of the physics department in the 1970s, was a \"witness to routine suppression of negative data\" and that Roark wrote in a 1987 letter that it was his \"belief that the many scientific claims both to the factual evidence of unique, beneficial effects of T.M. and physics are not only without any reasonable basis, but in fact in many ways fraudulent\". Roark said \"he had questioned\" MIU faculty member Michael Dillbeck regarding his studies of brain wave coherence using EEG measurements during practice of the TM-Sidhi program, and that Dilbeck confirmed that it was impossible to make EEG measurements while the subjects are moving. Williamson writes in her book that Roark questioned other investigators \"regarding the alleged reduction in crime if enough people practice TM or the TM-Sidhi program\" and they \"confirmed that they had suppressed negative evidence\". The EEG research referred to by Roark, which required researchers to make EEG measurements during the TM-Sidhi program, was subsequently published in two separate studies in the International Journal of Neuroscience. The editor-in-chief, Sydney Weinstein, said that the studies published in his journal are reviewed by \"a distinguished group of scientists from leading universities,\" and added, \"Not once have these scientists ever questioned the integrity or scientific validity of the papers on Transcendental Meditation.\" In 2002, The Gazette (Cedar Rapids and Iowa City) and Chicago Sun-Times reported that although \"a few years ago\" many \"major medical schools\" would have \"turned up their noses\" at the studies MIU was conducting, \"things have changed\" and MIU has received so many offers that it has \"turned away\" collaboration proposals from a few institutions.Krantz, Colleen, (September 12, 2002) Schools team with Maharishi Gets requests to be partner on studies of alternative medicine, Chicago Sun-Times According to an MIU spokesperson, the university had received almost $18 million in grant support from the National Institutes of Health in the prior 15 years and \"its researchers are strict about scientific standards because they work more often with other, larger universities\" including the University of Iowa; University of California, Irvine; and University of Hawaii. The article reports that Maharishi University and the University of Iowa were working on a study that looked at the effects of holistic therapy on heart disease. According to news reports in 2003, MIU's Center for Natural Medicine and Prevention (CNMP) was in collaboration with a \"growing list of mainstream universities\" including Howard University, the Medical College of Wisconsin, the University of Pennsylvania, Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science and the University of California at Irvine. According to the article, \"mainstream medical researchers \u2013 including many scientists suspicious of spiritualism\" no longer believe that MIU's research is junk science. ==Reception== MIU has received both criticism and acclaim. Author Samuel Schuman reports that while many in the higher education community did not take the university seriously when it began in 1974, the college has \"persisted cheerfully\" for more than three decades and its achievements and results are \"incontestably impressive\". Some members of the local community were initially against the university with 540 residents signing a petition protesting the local school board for allowing four MIU students to visit the public schools as observers. However, author William Jefferson reports that by 1976, 200 local people had \"taken up Transcendental Meditation themselves\" and compared to the \"wild and woolly\" students of the prior college, \"nearly all the residents now agree that they [MIU students] are nice people to have around\". A 1976 article in The New York Times described the campus as a \"cheerful, optimistic place where people smile a lot and tend to be considerate and trusting\". In 1992 The New York Times reported that the university was a place where all students and faculty meditate, and all the Maharishi's teachings are woven into mathematics, physics and every other subject, similar to colleges with strong religious affiliations, while noting it is \"an accredited university with grant-winning faculty members and competitive students\". The article goes on to say that even as the university gains research grants and subsequent credibility, it also faces controversy. For example, one critic, 1979 alumnus Curtis Mailloux, called the campus a \"coercive environment\" with a \"propensity for fraudulent research\". Accreditation officials say they are aware of these accusations and \"have been aggressive in checking Marahishi International's academic freedom\". The deputy director of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCACS), Steven D. Crow, says \"Every move the university's made has been monitored\" and MIU's library, faculty, academic mission and classroom space have been deemed appropriate. At the same time John W. Patterson, a professor at Iowa State University has harshly criticized The North Central Association's evaluation, saying it \"does nothing more than to lend credibility to these crackpots\". The article also reports that many non- students have moved to the city of Fairfield \"so they can meditate in the [campus meditation] domes\". In 1986, seven \"former devotees\" filed a fraud suit against the Maharishi saying they paid thousands of dollars for lessons at Maharishi International University that were designed to reduce stress, improve memory, reverse aging, and develop clairvoyance and levitation. One plaintiff said that after ten years he had not acquired any of the special abilities that were promised. According to reviews of the 1992 book, Heaven on Earth \u2013 Dispatches from America\u2019s Spiritual Frontier, author and reporter Michael D'Antonio wrote that the MIU physics department was teaching theories that he believed were \"dead wrong\" and alleged that the university had taken Transcendental Meditation \"into a grandiose narcissistic dream, a form of intellectual bondage, that they call enlightenment\". MIU is listed in Peterson's 440 Great Colleges for Top Students 2010. According to the National Survey of Student Engagement MIU scored in the top 3% for \"active and collaborative learning,\" in the top 4% for \"enriching educational experience,\" in the top 7% for \"student/faculty interaction,\" in the top 8% for \"supportive campus environment,\" and in the top 26% for \"level of academic challenge.\" MIU graduates also gave their college experience a \"higher than average satisfaction\" rating as recorded in the \"annual ACT alumni survey.\" Specifically, 73% said they would choose MIU again, more than twice the national average of 32%. The university has been categorized as a \"Sierra Club Cool School\" and in 2014 was ranked as the fourth best environmental science school by career guide website, Environmental Science. ==In popular culture== The Beach Boys recorded their 1978 album M.I.U. Album on the campus, and named it after the university. Man on the Moon, a biopic of entertainer Andy Kaufman, includes a scene at Maharishi International University in which Kaufman is asked to leave a retreat because his behavior was unbecoming an enlightened individual. In October 2011, Oprah Winfrey visited MIU, toured the campus and attended a group meditation in the golden dome for ladies.\"Oprah Winfrey visited Maharishi University in Fairfield (Iowa)|Personal development and spiritual blog: AmAre happiness blog\", October 21, 2011 Video footage of her visit to the MIU campus was shown on an episode of her show.Sundays at 9/8c on OWN #Nextchapter, Retrieved 27 March 2012\"Fairfield's fame levitates after Oprah's meditation\" Des Moines Register, March 24, 2012 ==Notable alumni and faculty== Noted alumni include self-help author Peter McWilliams, Nat Goldhaber, an original founder of the University, ufologist Jeff Peckman who attended for one year, and Ron Parker, a Canadian Natural Law Party candidate who received his PhD in physics from MIU.
