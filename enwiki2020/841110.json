    "text": "The Jimmy Stewart Show is an American sitcom starring Jimmy Stewart. Twenty- four episodes of the show were broadcast in the 1971\u20131972 season on the NBC network's Sunday night schedule (8:30-9 pm ET), under the sponsorship of Procter & Gamble. == Storyline == Stewart starred as James K. Howard, an anthropology professor at Josiah Kessel College, the small-town university founded by his grandfather in the fictional town of Easy Valley, California. His easy life became complicated when his son Peter's house burned down and he invited Peter's entire family to move in temporarily. The show's opening credits are seen while Stewart bicycles through the community. The show received poor reviews and ratings in its only season and was not renewed. ==Cast== * Jimmy Stewart as Prof. James K. Howard * Julie Adams as Martha Howard * Jonathan Daly as Peter Howard * Ellen Geer as Wendy Howard * Dennis Larson as Teddy Howard * Kirby Furlong as Jake Howard * John McGiver as Dr. Luther Quince ==Production== The show is notable as the only television or film production in which Stewart allowed himself to be billed onscreen as \"Jimmy\". In all of his movies, he was billed as \"James Stewart\" (although he also used \"Jimmy\" for his book Jimmy Stewart and His Poems). On one program Beulah Bondi portrayed James Stewart's mother. She also played his mother in four films: It's a Wonderful Life, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Of Human Hearts, and Vivacious Lady. According to series producer Hal Kanter, Stewart had African American actor Hal Williams dismissed from a guest appearance in one episode (in which Williams' character was to confront Stewart's) on racial grounds. ==Episodes== ==Home release== On January 21, 2014, Warner Home Video released The Jimmy Stewart Show: The Complete Series on DVD in Region 1, via their Warner Archive Collection.
