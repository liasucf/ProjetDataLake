    "text": "Aristolochia littoralis - MHNT Aristolochia littoralis, the calico flower or elegant Dutchman's pipe, is a species of evergreen vine belonging to the family Aristolochiaceae. ==Etymology== The scientific name Aristolochia was developed from Ancient Greek aristos (\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2) \"best\" + locheia (\u03bb\u03bf\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03b1), \"childbirth\" or \"childbed\", as in ancient times the plant was thought to be effective against infections caused by childbirth. The species Latin name littoralis means \u201ccoastal\u201d. ==Description== Aristolochia littoralis is a climbing vine that can reach about in length. The slender stems are woody and the leaves are bright green, cordate, amplexicaul, long and wide, forming a dense attractive foliage. Flowers are heart-shaped, greenish yellow with intricate purplish-brown markings. These unusual flowers are about long, grow solitary in the leaf axils and resemble Sherlock Holmes's pipe (hence the common name of \"Dutchman's pipe\"). The inner surface of the flared mouth is completely purplish-brown. The flowering period extends through all summer. These plants are pollinated by flies which are attracted by the unpleasant carrion-like odor produced by the flowers. The numerous winged seeds are borne in dry dehiscent capsules that split like small parachutes. As the seeds are winged they are easily dispersed by wind. Plants in the related genus Pararistolochia differ by having fleshy moist fruit that do not split. This plant contains aristolochic acid, a toxic alkaloid. ==Distribution== The vining plant is native to southern and western South America. It is found in: *Brazil in Ceara, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Parana, Rio de Janeiro, Rondonia, Santa Catarina, and S\u00e3o Paulo states. *Argentina in Corrientes, Entre Rios, Jujuy, Misiones, and Santa Fe Provinces. *Paraguay in Amambay, Central, Concepcion, Cordillera, Paraguari, and San Pedro Departments. *Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. It is an invasive species in Australia and in the southern United States. In Australia it is fatal to the caterpillars of two butterflies, the Cairns birdwing (Ornithoptera euphorion) and of the threatened Richmond birdwing (O. richmondia), and threatens to displace their proper host plant, A. tagala. ==Habitat== Aristolochia littoralis prefers acid-neutral soils (pH 5.5 \u2013 7.0) and average moisture, in part sun to shade, at an elevation of about ==Cultivation== This subtropical plant requires a minimum temperature of 7 \u00b0C, and in temperate regions is grown under glass. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. ==Gallery== File:Aristolochiaceae - Aristolochia littoralis.JPG|Flower and immature fruit of Aristolochia littoralis File:Starr 080716-9434 Aristolochia littoralis.jpg|The dense foliage File:Starr 080716-9433 Aristolochia littoralis.jpg|Leaves and immature fruit File:Starr 080716-9441 Aristolochia littoralis.jpg|The dehiscent capsules File:Starr 080716-9445 Aristolochia littoralis.jpg|The winged seeds ==References== * Forest Starr, Kim Starr, and Lloyd Loope Aristolochia littoralis * * Floridata ==External links== * Plants * Plants of Hawaii * Toptropicals * littoralis Category:Flora of Brazil Category:Flora of southern South America Category:Flora of western South America Category:Garden plants of South America Category:Vines ",
