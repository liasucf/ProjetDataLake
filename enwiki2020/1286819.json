    "text": "In road bicycle racing, a Grand Tour is one of the three major European professional cycling stage races: Giro d'Italia, Tour de France and Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a. Collectively they are termed the Grand Tours, and all three races are similar in format being three week races with daily stages. They have a special status in the UCI regulations: more points for the UCI World Tour are distributed in Grand Tours than in other races, and they are the only stage races allowed to last longer than 14 days. The Giro d'Italia is generally run in May, the Tour de France in July, and the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a in late August and September. The Vuelta was originally held in the spring, usually late April, with a few editions held in June in the 1940s. In 1995, however, the race moved to September to avoid direct competition with the Giro d'Italia. The Tour de France is the oldest and most prestigious in terms of points accrued to racers of all three, and is the most widely attended annual sporting event in the world. The Tour, the Giro and the Road World Cycling Championship make up the Triple Crown of Cycling. The three Grand Tours are men's events, and no three week races exist on the women's road cycling circuit. The Giro Rosa, the ten stage Italian road race for women is the only race on the current women's circuit treated as broadly equivalent to a Grand Tour, although the defunct women's Tour de France was, in its time, given similar status. == Description == In their current form, the Grand Tours are held over three consecutive weeks and typically include two rest days near the beginning of the second and third weeks. If the opening stages are in a country not neighboring the home nation of the race, there is sometimes an additional rest day after the opening weekend to allow for transfers. The stages are a mix of long massed start races (sometimes including mountain and hill climbs and descents; others are flat stages favoring those with a sprint finish) and individual and team time trials. Stages in the Grand Tours are generally under 200 kilometers in length. Controversy often surrounds which teams are invited to the event. Typically, the Union Cycliste Internationale (International Cycling Union) prefers top-rated professional teams to enter, while operators of the Grand Tours often want teams based in their country or those unlikely to cause controversy. From 2005 to 2007, organisers had to accept all ProTour teams, leaving only two wildcard teams per Tour. However, the Unibet team, a ProTour team normally guaranteed entry, was banned from the three Grand Tours for violating gambling advertising laws. In 2008, following numerous doping scandals, some teams were refused entry to the Grand Tours: Astana did not compete at the 2008 Tour de France and Team Columbia did not compete at the 2008 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a. Since 2011, under the UCI World Tour rules, all UCI WorldTeams are guaranteed a place in all three events, and obliged to participate, and the organisers are free to invite wild card teams of UCI ProContinental status to make up the 22 teams that usually compete. The main competition is the individual general classification, decided on aggregate time (sometimes after allowance of time bonuses). There are also classifications for teams and young riders, and based on climbing and sprinting points, and other minor competitions. Three riders have won the three individual classifications open to all riders (general, mountains and points classifications) in the same race: Eddy Merckx in the 1968 Giro d'Italia and 1969 Tour de France, Tony Rominger in the 1993 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a and Laurent Jalabert in the 1995 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a. It is rare for cyclists to ride all grand tours in the same year; in 2004, 474 cyclists started in at least one of the grand tours, 68 of them rode two Grand Tours and only two cyclists started in all three grand tours. It is not unusual for sprinters to start each of the Grand Tours and aim for stage wins before the most difficult stages occur. Alessandro Petacchi and Mark Cavendish started all three Grand Tours in 2010 and 2011, respectively, as did some of their preferred support riders. For both riders in both years, only the Tour de France was ridden to its conclusion. Over the years, 34 riders have completed all three Grand Tours in one year: Adam Hansen did so six years in a row. The only riders to have finished in the top 10 in each of the three tours during the same year are Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani in 1955 and Gastone Nencini in 1957. In cycling history riders from a single country won all three Grand Tours in a year on only three occasions. In 1964 with French riders Jacques Anquetil and Raymond Poulidor and in 2008 with Spanish riders Alberto Contador and Carlos Sastre. 2018 marked the only time a different rider from the same country won all three Tours and this was British riders Chris Froome, Geraint Thomas and Simon Yates. == UCI rules == For the UCI World Tour, more points are given in grand tours than in other races; the winner of the Tour de France receives 1000 points, and the winners of the Giro and Vuelta receive 850 points. Depending on the nature of other races, points vary for the winner of the overall classification The grand tours have a special status for the length: they are allowed to last between 15 and 23 days. == Latest edition details == Giro d'Italia (2019) * Dates: 11 May \u2013 2 June 2019 * alt= General classification winner: Tour de France (2020) * Dates: 29 August \u2013 20 September 2020 * alt= General classification winner: Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a (2019) * Dates: 24 August \u2013 15 September 2019 * alt= General classification winner: == Grand Tour winners == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%\" |- !

Lance Armstrong was declared winner of seven consecutive tours from 1999 to 2005. However, in October 2012, he was stripped of all titles by the UCI for his use of performance-enhancing drugs. Organizers of the Tour de France announced that the winner's slot would remain empty in the record books, rather than transfer the win to the second-place finishers each year. However, in October 2014, the Tour de France resumed listing Armstrong as a previous winner of the tour, but with his name crossed out. == Statistics == === Most Grand Tour wins per rider === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Rank !Rider !Total !Tour !Giro !Vuelta |- | 1 | | 11 | 5 (1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1974) | 5 (1968, 1970, 1972, 1973, 1974) | 1 (1973) |- | 2 | | 10 | 5 (1978, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1985) | 3 (1980, 1982, 1985) | 2 (1978, 1983) |- | 3 | | 8 | 5 (1957, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964) | 2 (1960, 1964) | 1 (1963) |- | rowspan=4|4 | | 7 | 2 (1949, 1952) | 5 (1940, 1947, 1949, 1952, 1953) | \u2013 |- | | 7 | 5 (1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995) | 2 (1992, 1993) | \u2013 |- | | 7 | 2 (2007, 2009) | 2 (2008, 2015) | 3 (2008, 2012, 2014) |- | '''''' | 7 | 4 (2013, 2015, 2016, 2017) | 1 (2018) | 2 (2011, 2017) |- | rowspan=3|8 | | 5 | \u2013 | 5 (1925, 1927, 1928, 1929, 1933) | \u2013 |- | | 5 | 2 (1938, 1948) | 3 (1936, 1937, 1946) | \u2013 |- | | 5 | 1 (1965) | 3 (1967, 1969, 1976) | 1 (1968) |- |} *Active riders marked in bold. ===Wins by country=== {| class=\"sortable plainrowheaders wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |+Grand Tour general classification wins by country |- !scope=col|Country !scope=col|Giro !scope=col|Tour !scope=col|Vuelta !scope=col|Total |- !scope=row align=left| | 69 | 10 | 6 | 85 |- !scope=row align=left| | 6 | 36 | 9 | 51 |- !scope=row align=left| | 4 | 12 | 32 | 48 |- !scope=row align=left| | 7 | 18 | 7 | 32 |- !scope=row align=left| | 3 | 2 | 5 | 10 |- !scope=row align=left| | 1 | 6 | 3 | 10 |- !scope=row align=left| | 2 | 5 | 0 | 7 |- !scope=row align=left| | 1 | 3 | 1 | 5 |- !scope=row align=left| | 1 | 2 | 2 | 5 |- !scope=row align=left| | 1 | 1 | 2 | 4 |- !scope=row align=left| | 0 | 1 | 3 | 4 |- !scope=row align=left| | 3 | 0 | 1 | 4 |- !scope=row align=left| | 1 | 1 | 1 | 3 |- !scope=row align=left| | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 |- !scope=row align=left| | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |- !scope=row align=left| | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |- !scope=row align=left| | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |- !scope=row align=left| | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |- !scope=row align=left| | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |- !scope=row align=left| | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |} === Winners of all three Grand Tours === Seven cyclists have won all three of the Grand Tours during their career: * : 5 Tours (1957, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964), 2 Giros (1960, 1964), 1 Vuelta (1963). * : 1 Tour (1965), 3 Giros (1967, 1969, 1976), 1 Vuelta (1968) * : 5 Tours (1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1974), 5 Giros (1968, 1970, 1972, 1973, 1974), 1 Vuelta (1973) * : 5 Tours (1978, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1985), 3 Giros (1980, 1982, 1985), 2 Vueltas (1978, 1983) * : 2 Tours (2007, 2009), 2 Giros (2008, 2015), 3 Vueltas (2008, 2012, 2014) * : 1 Tour (2014), 2 Giros (2013, 2016), 1 Vuelta (2010). * : 4 Tours (2013, 2015, 2016, 2017), 1 Giro (2018), 2 Vueltas (2011, 2017).
