It is endemic to south-eastern Queensland and north-eastern New South Wales, where it inhabits streams near their springs. Griseargiolestes fontanus is a medium-sized damselfly, black-green metallic in colour with pale markings; adults have only a slight pruinescence. Like other members of the family Megapodagrionidae, it rests with its wings outspread. Griseargiolestes fontanus appears similar to Griseargiolestes albescens, though with less pruinescence. ==Gallery== Griseargiolestes fontanus female (11776183266).jpg | Tip of female tail Griseargiolestes fontanus male (11775441135).jpg | Tip of male tail Griseargiolestes fontanus female wings (34828372075).jpg | Female wings Griseargiolestes fontanus male wings (34828379475).jpg | Male wings ==See also== * List of Odonata species of Australia == References == Category:Megapodagrionidae Category:Odonata of Australia Category:Insects of Australia Category:Endemic fauna of Australia Category:Taxa named by Robert John Tillyard Category:Insects described in 1913 Category:Damselflies ",
