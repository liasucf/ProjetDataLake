The Accord PHEV was introduced in Japan in June 2013 and it is available only for leasing, primarily to corporations and government agencies. , the Accord PHEV ranks as the third best selling plug-in hybrid in the Japanese market. A total of 1,039 units have been sold in the United States through 2015. See section \"December 2014 Plug-in Hybrid Car Sales Numbers\" See section \"May 2015 Plug-in Hybrid Car Sales Numbers\" Honda unveiled the platform for a mid-size plug-in hybrid electric vehicle at the 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show. The plug-in platform showcased Honda's next-generation two-motor hybrid system, which continuously moves through three different modes to maximize driving efficiency: all- electric, gasoline-electric and an engine direct-drive mode. The plug-in hybrid also uses regenerative braking to charge the battery. In all-electric mode, the vehicle uses a 7 kWh lithium-ion battery and a 120 kW electric motor. The all-electric mode achieves a range of approximately in city driving and a top speed of . Fully recharging the battery will take 2 to 2.5 hours using a 120-volt outlet and 1 to 1.5 hours using a 240-volt outlet. Honda announced at the 2012 North American International Auto Show in Detroit that first US application of both a 2.4-liter direct-injected engine and two-motor plug-in hybrid system to be implemented on the Accord ninth generation, the 2013 Accord Plug-in Hybrid, with sales scheduled for late 2012 or early 2013.

The Accord Plug-in Hybrid was scheduled for release in early 2013, and would serve as the basis for the conventional hybrid version of the Accord Sedan that would go on sale by mid-2013. It features a 6.7 kWh lithium-ion battery pack to power a 124 kW electric motor mated with the new Earth Dreams i-VTEC 2.0-liter 4-cylinder Atkinson-cycle gasoline engine producing 137 hp (102 kW) at 6200 rpm, and together the total system output is 196 hp (146 kW), which surpasses that of the Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid (134 hp), Chevrolet Volt (149 hp) and Ford Fusion Energi (195 hp)plug-in hybrid. Honda expected the 2014 Accord Plug-in Hybrid to deliver an all-electric range of up to and a total driving range of more than based on the U.S. EPA tests as determined by Honda. The carmaker also expected the fuel economy for the Accord Plug-in Hybrid to exceed 100 miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent (MPG-e) (2.4 L/100 km; 120 mpg-imp equivalent), and also expects it to receive an Enhanced AT-PZEV rating from the California Air Resources Board (CARB). The official EPA ratings for the plug-in hybrid are of all-electric range with a combined fuel economy rating of 115 miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent (MPG-e), the highest in its class. EPA ratings for operation in hybrid mode are in combined city/highway cycle, in city, and in highway driving. The 2014 Accord PHEV is the first car in the U.S. to meet the new LEV3/SULEV20 emissions standards, and will get single-occupant carpool access in California. === Plug-in and Natural Gas GX discontinued === The Accord Plug-in Hybrid was discontinued after the 2015 model year, together with the Civic Hybrid and the natural gas-powered Honda Civic GX. This decision was due in part to Honda's ability to advance fuel economy through conventional engine technology. In 2017, Honda launched the Honda Clarity plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicle, after the introduction of the next-generation Clarity fuel cell vehicle in 2016. === 2016 facelift and 2017 Hybrid === The ninth generation Accord received a facelift for the 2016 model year. Changes to outer appearance include new front fascia, grill, head lights, rear lights, and alloy wheel designs. The 2016 Accord was the first mass-market car to be equipped with Apple CarPlay and the second car to also be compatible with Android Auto. The Hybrid Accord returned for the 2017 model year with revised running gear that has combined output of 214 hp (160 kW), up from 196 hp (146 kW) of the 2014 & 2015 model years version.

Both conventional and plug-in hybrid configurations are offered, both released in the U.S. market in the second half of 2013. Honda has focused on economy, ride quality, responsiveness, and ride comfort with a completely redesigned front suspension. A simpler MacPherson strut design, replaces the class leading and highly refined double wishbone front suspension, in use since the second generation Accord. The rear suspension retains the independent multi-link suspension. The costlier design is now available only on the top-tier Acura RLX. The new front suspension helps shave weight and free up room in the engine compartment. In addition to the safety concerns of Honda's Advanced Compatibility Engineering, there is focus on body stiffness and dynamic handling response by improving structural rigidity around the front strut tower and lower control arm. All but the LX trim feature a strut bar. All trims receive upgraded shocks front and rear. The Touring trim now comes with more sophisticated double piston shocks called \"Amplitude Reactive Dampers\" that have been recently introduced on several Acura models. The Accord's body now uses 55.8% high strength steel, a total of 17.2% are either of 780, 980 or 1,500 MPa yield strength types which were not used in the previous generation.
