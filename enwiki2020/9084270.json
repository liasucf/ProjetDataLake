It took place in 1990 and was the first year the Dodge Daytona was used in competition, and continued the format introduced in IROC VIII. Due to not getting enough test time for the new cars, the originally scheduled opener at Daytona International Speedway was canceled. Race one took place on the Talladega Superspeedway, race two took place at Burke Lakefront Airport, and race three ran at Michigan International Speedway. Dale Earnhardt won the series championship, his first of four, and took home $175,000 for his efforts. ==Roster and total points== The roster of drivers and final points standings were as follows: IROC season statistics at racing-reference.info, Retrieved March 8, 2007 {| class=\"wikitable\" !Position !Driver !Points !Winnings !Series |- | 1 || Dale Earnhardt|| 60 || $175,000 || NASCAR Winston Cup Series 2nd in 1989 Winston Cup points |- | 2 || Al Unser, Jr. || 44 || $65,000 || CART PPG IndyCar World Series 5th in 1989 Indycar points |- | 3 || Martin Brundle || 41 || $50,000 || 1989: FIA Formula One World Championship 1990: World Endurance Championship |- | 4 || Mark Martin || 37 || $45,000 || NASCAR Winston Cup Series 3rd in 1989 Winston Cup points 1989 24 Hours of Daytona GTO winner |- | 5 || Terry Labonte || 36 || $40,000 || NASCAR Winston Cup Series Defending IROC Champion |- | 6 || Emerson Fittipaldi|| 29 || $38,000 || CART PPG IndyCar World Series 1989 Indianapolis 500 winner 1989 IndyCar Champion 2 Time FIA Formula One World Champion |- | 7 || Dorsey Schroeder 1 || 26 || $35,000 || SCCA Trans-Am Series 1989 Trans-Am Champion 1989 12 Hours of Sebring GTO winner |- | 8 || Rusty Wallace 1 || 26 ||$34,000 || NASCAR Winston Cup Series 1989 Winston Cup champion 1989 NASCAR All Star Race winner |- | 9 || Darrell Waltrip || 23 || $33,000 || NASCAR Winston Cup Series 4th in 1989 Winston Cup points 1989 Daytona 500 winner |- | 10 || Bobby Rahal 2 || 18 || $32,000 || CART PPG IndyCar World Series 9th in 1989 IndyCar points |- | 11 || Geoff Brabham 2 || 18 || $31,000 || IMSA Camel GTP 1989 GTP Champion 1989 24 Hours of Daytona GTP winner 1989 12 Hours of Sebring GTP winner |- | 12|| Danny Sullivan || 13 || $30,000 || CART PPG IndyCar World Series 7th in 1989 IndyCar points |} ==Individual race results== ===Race One, Talladega Superspeedway=== Saturday, May 5th, 1990 {| class=\"wikitable\" !Finish !Grid !Car no. !Driver !Car Make !Car Color !Laps !Status !Laps Led !Points |- | 1 || 9 || 9 || Dale Earnhardt || Dodge Daytona || Silver || 38 || 0:32:15 || 10 || 24 (3) |- | 2 || 8 || 8 || Al Unser, Jr. || Dodge Daytona || || 38 || Running || 5 || 17 |- | 3 || 2 || 2 || Mark Martin || Dodge Daytona || Yellow || 38 || Running || 5 || 14 |- | 4 || 11 || 11 || Darrell Waltrip || Dodge Daytona || || 38 || Running || 11 || 17 (5) |- | 5 || 10 || 10 || Martin Brundle || Dodge Daytona || Mustard || 38 || Running || || 10 |- | 6 || 4 || 4 || Dorsey Schroeder || Dodge Daytona || || 38 || Running || || 9 |- | 7 || 5 || 5 || Rusty Wallace || Dodge Daytona || || 38 || Running || 7 || 10 (2) |- | 8 || 12 || 12 || Terry Labonte || Dodge Daytona || Orange || 38 || Running || || 7 |- | 9 || 7 || 7 || Geoff Brabham || Dodge Daytona || || 38 || Running || || 6 |- | 10 || 6 || 6 || Emerson Fittipaldi || Dodge Daytona || || 38 || Running || || 5 |- | 11 || 1 || 1 || Bobby Rahal || Dodge Daytona || Pink || 38 || Running || || 4 |- | 12 || 3 || 3 || Danny Sullivan || Dodge Daytona || Lime || 37 || Running || || 3 |} (5) Indicates 5 bonus points added to normal race points scored for leading the most laps.
