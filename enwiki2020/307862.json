    "text": "F\u00e5r\u00f6 () is a Baltic Sea island just north of the island of Gotland, itself off mainland Sweden's southeastern coast. It is the second-largest island in the province and it is a popular summer resort. It has its own dialect (Faroymal, a dialect of Gutnish). F\u00e5r\u00f6 is also the name of the populated area, socken (not to be confused with parish), consisting of both F\u00e5r\u00f6 and Gotska Sand\u00f6n islands.The exact extent of the socken, now district, can be obtained by clicking on Kartinst\u00e4llningar and check the Socken box in the menu of this map from the Swedish National Heritage Board database. It comprises the same area as the administrative F\u00e5r\u00f6 District, established on 1January 2016. ==Geography== F\u00e5r\u00f6 Church The island is separated from Gotland by the narrow F\u00e5r\u00f6-strait, and connected by two car ferries, operated by the Swedish Transport Administration. It has a total area of , of which are water areas or islets. On the islands of F\u00e5r\u00f6 and Gotland are rock formations called rauk. They are a result of erosion during the Ice age and are unique to Gotland and F\u00e5r\u00f6. The medieval F\u00e5r\u00f6 Church is on F\u00e5r\u00f6. , F\u00e5r\u00f6 Church along with Gotska Sand\u00f6n Chapel on Gotska Sand\u00f6n belongs to F\u00e5r\u00f6 parish in Norra Gotlands pastorat. One of the asteroids in the Asteroid belt, 9358 F\u00e5r\u00f6, is named after the island. ==Etymology== The name \"F\u00e5r\u00f6\" (in Gutnish \"Faroy\") is derived from the words \"\u00f6\", meaning island, and probably \"far-\", which is a word stem associated with travel like in the Swedish verb \"fara\" (to travel). The word F\u00e5r\u00f6 probably means the island you have to travel to or the traveler's island. Mainland Swedes might misinterpret the name F\u00e5r\u00f6 to be derived from f\u00e5r, the (standard) Swedish word for sheep, due to the many sheep on the island. That word is absent from Modern Gutnish, which uses the word \"lamm\" (which in Swedish means \"lamb\"). ==Military past== Until the 1990s, F\u00e5r\u00f6 and the North of Gotland were off-limits to foreigners because of a government military installation there. There were large, multilingual signs at the side of the roads informing visitors of this and the prohibition was strictly enforced. After the Cold War ended, the installation (Swedish Coastal Artillery regiment KA 3) was mostly shut down. A relic of the island's military past is a tall radio mast at Holmudden at . ==Cinematic heritage== Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman lived and died on F\u00e5r\u00f6 and several of his films were filmed there, among them Through a Glass Darkly (1961), Persona (1966), Hour of the Wolf (1968), Shame (1968), The Passion of Anna (1969), and Scenes from a Marriage (1972), as well as Liv Ullmann\u2019s Faithless (2000), based on a Bergman screenplay. The Bergman Week is a tribute to the filmmaker held on the island every June. F\u00e5r\u00f6 itself is the subject of Bergman's 1970 documentary film F\u00e5r\u00f6 Document. Andrei Tarkovsky wanted to film The Sacrifice on F\u00e5r\u00f6 but was denied access by the military. The Sacrifice was filmed further south on Gotland at N\u00e4r. ==Tourism== An annual event on F\u00e5r\u00f6 is \"F\u00e5r\u00f6natta\" (F\u00e5r\u00f6 Night), held in September, during which restaurants and bars stay open all night, craft stands are set up and the church holds a midnight Mass. == Places of interest == F\u00e5r\u00f6 Fyr Sudersand === Digerhuvud === The Digerhuvud coast with Bj\u00e4rge nature reserve is the largest stack area in Sweden, with hundreds of stacks along a part of the coast. Close by is the Helgumannen fishing village. The coast is not suited for swimming due to its depth (up to close to the shore), and its strong currents. An asteroid in the Asteroid belt, 10102 Digerhuvud, is named after the area. ===F\u00e5r\u00f6 Lighthouse=== The F\u00e5r\u00f6 Lighthouse lies on the island's northeastern point. It is high and was built between 1846 and 1847. ===Langhammars=== The Langhammars peninsula and the Langhammars nature reserve on north-western F\u00e5r\u00f6 are rocky beaches with Ice age stone monoliths known as rauks. Langhammars was the setting for Ingmar Bergman's film Shame. ===Sudersand=== The long, sandy Sudersand beach on north-eastern F\u00e5r\u00f6 lies next to Sudersands Semesterby which rents cabins to tourists. ==References== ==External links== *Objects from F\u00e5r\u00f6 at the Digital Museum by Nordic Museum * Gotland Tourist Association \u2014 F\u00e5r\u00f6 Category:Gotland Category:Swedish islands in the Baltic Category:Islands of Gotland County Category:Military history of Sweden Category:Cultural heritage of Sweden Category:Cinema of Sweden Category:Ingmar Bergman ",
