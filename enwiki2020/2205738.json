    "text": "In Greek mythology, Callirrhoe or Callirhoe (Ancient Greek: \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03c1\u03c1\u03cc\u03b7 or \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03c1\u03cc\u03b7, meaning \"Beautiful Flow,\" often written Callirrho\u00eb) was a naiad. She was the daughter of Oceanus and Tethys.Hesiod, Theogony 351. English Translation by Hugh G. Evelyn-White. Theogony. Cambridge, MA.,Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1914. She was mentioned as a companion of Persephone when the daughter of Demeter was abducted by the lord of the dead, Hades.Homeric Hymn 2, 417 Callirhoe had consorted with Chrysaor, Neilus and Poseidon. She was one of the three ancestors of the Tyrians, along with Abarbarea and Drosera.Nonnus, Dionysiaca, 40. 535 ff Jupiter's moon Callirrhoe is named after her. She also mothered Cotys by Manes, king of Maeonia.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities Book 1.27.1.

Though Herbert Jennings Rose says simply that it is \"not clear which parents are meant\", Athanassakis, p. 44, says that Phorcys and Ceto are the \"more likely candidates for parents of this hideous creature who proceeded to give birth to a series of monsters and scourges\". The problem arises from the ambiguous referent of the pronoun \"she\" in line 295 of the Theogony. While some have read this \"she\" as referring to Callirhoe (e.g. Smith \"Echidna\"; Morford, p. 162), according to Clay, p. 159 n. 32, \"the modern scholarly consensus\" reads Ceto, see for example Gantz, p. 22; Caldwell, pp. 7, 46 295-303; Grimal, \"Echidna\" p. 143. *By Neilus: **ChioneMaurus Servius Honoratus.
