    "text": "The 2019\u201320 Women's Big Bash League season or WBBL|05 is the fifth season of Women's Big Bash League (WBBL), the semi-professional women's Twenty20 domestic cricket competition in Australia. The tournament moved to a standalone calendar slot, shifting away from the men's BBL, beginning on 18 October and running to 8 December 2019. The Sydney Sixers entered the season as \"hot favourites\", but they lost five consecutive games in the back-half of the tournament and missed out on qualifying for finals for the first time after captain Ellyse Perry sustained a shoulder injury. Defending champions Brisbane Heat finished the regular season on top of the ladder, earning the right to host all three playoff matches at Allan Border Field. The Heat retained their title on 8 December 2019 when they defeated first-time finalist Adelaide Strikers, which featured Player of the Tournament Sophie Devine, by six wickets in the championship decider. Beth Mooney was named Player of the Final for the second consecutive season. == Teams == Each 2019\u201320 squad featured 15 active players, with an allowance of up to five marquee signings including a maximum of three from overseas. Australian marquees are players who held a national women's team contract at the time of signing on for their WBBL|05 team. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=2 style=\"width: auto;\" | Team ! style=\"width: auto;\" | Home ground ! style=\"width: auto;\" | Secondary grounds ! style=\"width: auto;\" | Coach ! style=\"width: auto;\" | Captain ! style=\"width: auto;\" | Australian representatives ! style=\"width: auto;\" | Overseas players |-style=\"background:white;\" | style=\"background:#009FDF;\"| | Adelaide Strikers |Karen Rolton Oval (4) | Centennial Park Oval (1) | Luke Williams |Suzie Bates | Megan Schutt Amanda-Jade Wellington Sarah Coyte Tahlia McGrath | Suzie Bates Sophie Devine Stafanie Taylor Lauren Winfield |-style=\"background:#eee;\" | style=\"background:#00c1c1;\"| |Brisbane Heat |Allan Border Field (5) |Harrup Park (2) |Ashley Noffke | Kirby Short |Jess Jonassen Delissa Kimmince Beth Mooney Grace Harris | Maddy Green Amelia Kerr |-style=\"background:white;\" | style=\"background:#69359C;\"| | Hobart Hurricanes | Blundstone Arena (2) |West Park Oval (2) Invermay Park (1) |Salliann Briggs | Corinne Hall |Nicola Carey Belinda Vakarewa Tayla Vlaeminck | Heather Knight Chloe Tryon Fran Wilson Hayley Matthews |-style=\"background:#eee;\" | style=\"background:red;\"| | Melbourne Renegades |CitiPower Centre (5) |Eastern Oval (1) |Tim Coyle |Jess Duffin |Sophie Molineux Georgia Wareham Jess Duffin Molly Strano | Tammy Beaumont Lea Tahuhu Danielle Wyatt Chamari Atapattu |-style=\"background:white;\" | style=\"background:#00B13F;\"| | Melbourne Stars |CitiPower Centre (6) |N/A | David Hemp |Elyse Villani |Elyse Villani Kristen Beams Holly Ferling Erin Osborne | Mignon du Preez Lizelle Lee Katey Martin |-style=\"background:#eee;\" | style=\"background:#ff8000;\"| | Perth Scorchers |Lilac Hill Park (4) |WACA Ground (3) | Lisa Keightley | Meg Lanning |Nicole Bolton Meg Lanning Heather Graham | Kim Garth Amy Jones Nat Sciver |-style=\"background:white;\" | style=\"background:#FF0090;\"| | Sydney Sixers |North Sydney Oval (4) |Hurstville Oval (3) Drummoyne Oval (1) | Ben Sawyer | Ellyse Perry |Ashleigh Gardner Alyssa Healy Ellyse Perry Sarah Aley Erin Burns Lauren Cheatle | Dane van Niekerk Marizanne Kapp Hollie Armitage |-style=\"background:#eee;\" | style=\"background:#96D701;\"| | Sydney Thunder |Drummoyne Oval (2) | Bankstown Oval (1) Blacktown ISP Oval (1) Manuka Oval (1) North Dalton Park (1) North Sydney Oval (1) | Trevor Griffin |Rachael Haynes |Rachael Haynes Alex Blackwell Rene Farrell Naomi Stalenberg | Nida Dar Shabnim Ismail Rachel Priest |} === Australian marquee and domestic players === The pre- season was noted as particularly busy for player transfers which produced some of the biggest recruiting achievements in the tournament's five-year history. After finishing the last two tournaments on the bottom of the ladder, the Hobart Hurricanes managed to bolster their stocks by luring across Nicola Carey, Belinda Vakarewa and Maisy Gibson from the Sydney Thunder, as well as Tayla Vlaeminck from the Melbourne Renegades. Conversely the reigning champions, Brisbane Heat, suffered the losses of Josie Dooley to the Renegades and Jemma Barsby to the Perth Scorchers. Other local player movements included Elyse Villani departing the Scorchers to captain the Melbourne Stars, while Katie Mack left the Stars to join the Adelaide Strikers. The Hurricanes completed their roster with the readdition of Emily Smith, filling the wicket- keeping role left vacant by Georgia Redmayne's shift to the Scorchers. On 18 November 2019, Smith was banned for the remainder of WBBL|05 after contravening Cricket Australia's anti-corruption policy with a social media post. Under a special exemption, Tasmanian Tigers member Emma Manix-Geeves was brought into the Hurricanes squad as a replacement. === Overseas marquee players === There were several changes to overseas marquee allocations. Englishwoman Tammy Beaumont, previously a Striker, joined the Renegades after a year away from the league. She replaced New Zealand's Amy Satterthwaite, who would miss the season through maternity. South African Chloe Tryon joined the Hurricanes for 2019\u201320 along with England's Fran Wilson\u2014a member of the Thunder's 03 campaign. Nat Sciver returned for the Scorchers after not partaking in the previous season, replacing England teammate Kate Cross. Announced to join Sciver at Perth was Ireland's Kim Garth, appearing in the league for the first time since winning a second championship with the Sydney Sixers. However, some members of past title-winning squads would be absent: the Heat did not renew their contracts with Proteas pair Laura Wolvaardt and Sun\u00e9 Luus, instead they brought White Ferns duo Maddy Green and Amelia Kerr on board; and Kiwi Sara McGlashan's time at the Sixers came to an end when she announced her retirement from professional cricket in January 2019. Harmanpreet Kaur and Smriti Mandhana did not re-sign for the Thunder and Hurricanes respectively on account of a conflicting national team schedule, marking the first WBBL season to not feature any Indian-born players. This fixturing clash followed a dispute between the BCCI and CA earlier in the year when Australia's top talent (such as Meg Lanning, Ellyse Perry and Alyssa Healy) were excluded from the 2019 Women's T20 Challenge\u2014an exhibition tournament serving as a potential precursor to a future female equivalent of the Indian Premier League. ESPNcricinfo reported this breakdown was part of a wider disagreement between the two boards that revolved around the BCCI's insistence on CA honouring a touring commitment to play a men's bi-lateral ODI series in India in January 2020. Jamaican Stafanie Taylor ended her four-year run with the Thunder and was subsequently contracted by the Strikers. Due to international cricket commitments with the West Indies, Taylor was unavailable for the majority of WBBL|05 and would share a marquee position with England's Lauren Winfield. The Thunder filled their vacant overseas marquee spots by acquiring the services of Nida Dar\u2014making her the first Pakistani woman to sign a deal with an international cricket league\u2014and South Africa's Shabnim Ismail\u2014returning to the competition after a short inaugural season stint with the Melbourne Renegades. New Zealander Sophie Devine (Strikers) and South African Marizanne Kapp (Sixers) became the only foreigners to play in each of the first five WBBL seasons with one team. On 19 November, the Sydney Sixers announced the signing of Englishwoman Hollie Armitage, replacing captain Ellyse Perry who would miss five games due to a shoulder injury. After scoring a T20I century for Sri Lanka against Australia on 29 September 2019, former Renegade Chamari Atapattu stated in a post-match press conference she had not been offered a contract for the upcoming Women's Big Bash season despite her eagerness to participate, underlining the league's fierce competition for overseas marquee selection. However, it was announced on 30 November that Atapattu had signed with the Renegades for their last regular season game and finals. She replaced Tammy Beaumont who\u2014along with Danni Wyatt, Nat Sciver, Amy Jones and Lauren Winfield\u2014would miss out on the WBBL|05 finals due to national team commitments. === Coaching staff === Victorious WBBL|04 coach Peter McGiffin stepped down from his role at Brisbane and was replaced by Australian women's team assistant Ashley Noffke in June 2019. The Thunder and Strikers also made key changes ahead of the fifth season, appointing Super League title-winner Trevor Griffin and former first-class batsman Luke Williams to their respective head coach positions. Despite being ruled out of playing duties, the Renegades announced Amy Satterthwaite would continue to contribute off-field in a specialist coaching capacity throughout the WBBL|05 season. == Points table == Georgia Redmayne batting for Perth Scorchers against Sydney Sixers at Lilac Hill Park, Perth, on 23 November 2019. The Sixers' wicket-keeper and stand-in captain, Alyssa Healy, looks on. The Scorchers later won the match by 52 runs. == Win\u2013loss table == Below is a summary of results for each team's fourteen regular season matches, plus finals where applicable, in chronological order.
