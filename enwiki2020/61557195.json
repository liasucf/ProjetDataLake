In the first round, teams from one group play against teams from the other group once. In the second round, the teams from each group played in single round-robin format against the others in their group. The four group winners, plus the two teams with the most points in the sum of the rounds qualified to the Second phase, while the two teams with the fewest points in the sum of the rounds would dispute the Division B in 1997. * Division B: The twelve teams that had qualified to Division B in the previous year joined the two teams that had been promoted from the Second level, and were divided into two groups of seven, in which each team played the teams of its own group in a double round-robin system. the best four teams in each group qualified to the Second phase of that division, the leader of each group earning a bonus point, while the two worst teams in each group would dispute the Relegation Playoffs. In the second phase, the remaining eight teams would be divided into two groups of four, in which each team played the teams of its own group in a double round-robin system. The best team of each group would qualify to the Second phase of the championship, and to the Division A of the following year. * Relegation Playoffs: The four teams that had qualified to this round played each other in a double round-robin format. The two teams with the fewest points were relegated. * Second phase: The eight remaining teams were divided into two groups of four, in which each team played the teams of its own group in a double round-robin system. The best teams in each group qualified to the Semifinals. * Finals: The Second phase group winners played a two-legged knockout tie to define the champions. ==Championship== ===Division A=== ====First round==== =====Group 1===== =====Group 2===== ====Second round==== =====Group 1===== =====Group 2===== ====Final standings==== ===Division B=== ====S\u00e9rie 1==== ====S\u00e9rie 2==== ====Second phase==== =====S\u00e9rie 3===== =====S\u00e9rie 4===== ====Relegation Playoffs==== ===Second phase=== ====Group 1==== ====Group 2==== ===Finals=== |} ==Copa Daltro Menezes== For the second semester, a state cup was held; the Copa Daltro Menezes.
