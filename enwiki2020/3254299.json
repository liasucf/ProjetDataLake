    "text": "Nerolidol, also known as peruviol and penetrol , is a naturally occurring sesquiterpene alcohol found in the essential oils of many types of plants and flowers. There are two isomers of nerolidol, cis and trans, which differ in the geometry about the central double bond. Nerolidol is present in neroli, ginger, jasmine, lavender, tea tree, Cannabis sativa, and lemon grass, and is a dominant scent compound in Brassavola nodosa. The aroma of nerolidol is woody and reminiscent of fresh bark. It is used as a flavoring agent and in perfumery and is used in non-cosmetic products such as detergents and cleansers. It is currently under testing as a skin penetration enhancer for the transdermal delivery of therapeutic drugs.K. Moser et al. European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics 52 (2001) 103-112 Additionally, it is known for various biological activities include antioxidant, anti fungal, anticancer, and antimicrobial activity. It is one of several organic volatiles produced by the Arabidopsis lyrata ssp. petraea flower in response to insect feeding. Because of its hydrophobic nature, nerolidol is easily permeable across the plasma membrane and can interact with intracellular proteins. However it has a high cytotoxic potential and can disrupt the membrane. Nerolidyl compounds involve joining nerolidol at the oxygen atom to other groups, and include Nerolidyl diphosphate. ==See also== * Linalool * Farnesol ==References== Category:Tertiary alcohols Category:Perfume ingredients Category:Flavors Category:Sesquiterpenes ",
