He took up athletics in 1928 after joining the sport club \"Sarmata\". His coach there was the famous Estonian, decathlete Aleksander Klumberg. In his first competition at the Polish National Championships, Kusoci\u0144ski surprisingly won the 5000 m and cross country titles. He missed the next season, because he was called to duty by the Polish army, but he came back stronger than ever. He won the Polish Championship titles in the 1500 m and the 5000 m, in cross country in 1930 and 1931, and in the 800 m in 1932. Tomb of Janusz Kusoci\u0144ski in Palmiry near Warsaw In 1932 Kusoci\u0144ski was working as a gardener in a park in Warsaw.Wallechinsky, David (2004). The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics, Toronto: Sport Classic Books. Just about a month before the Los Angeles Olympics, Kusoci\u0144ski ran a new world record in the 3000 m (8:18.8) and later that year, he set a new unofficial world record in running 4 miles in a time of 19:02.6. At the Olympics, Kusoci\u0144ski won a close battle against the Finns Volmari Iso-Hollo and Lasse Virtanen in the 10 000 m, with a world season's best time of 30:11.4. After finishing second in the first European Championships at Turin in the 5000 m in 1934, Kusoci\u0144ski decided to retire from athletics, but made a comeback in 1939 by winning the 10 000 m at the Polish National Championships. Kusoci\u0144ski volunteered for the Polish army after Poland was attacked by the Germans and was wounded twice. During the German occupation he worked as a waiter, but was secretly a member of the Polish resistance. Janusz Kusoci\u0144ski was arrested by the Gestapo on 26 March 1940 during the AB Action and imprisoned in Mokot\u00f3w Prison. He was executed three months later in Palmiry, near Warsaw. An annual athletics competition, the Kusoci\u0144ski Memorial, is held in Poland in his honour. It was in its 55th edition in 2009.Grinberg, Daniel (8 June 2009).
