Before becoming a filmmaker, Gary pursued a professional career in acting, but she soon became disheartened by the reductive roles and characters that she was offered in the film industry. In Filmmaker magazine, Gary described this disillusionment as an impetus for her shift from acting to filmmaking: \"I was getting debasing roles. In Grand Theft Auto IV, I was the voice of a drug dealer's battered girlfriend, and you as a player would opt to save me or not. I wanted control over my image.\" Gary's work seeks to liberate the distorted histories through which Black life is often viewed, while fleshing out a nuanced and multivalent Black interiority. Through documentary film, archival footage, and experimental video art, Gary charts the ways in which structures of power shape our perceptions around representation, race, gender, sexuality, and violence. Gary has also focused on themes such as black feminist subjectivity and has confronted the often painful history of these subjects by featuring archival footage in her work. In conversation with Michael B. Gillespie, a film theorist and historian at the Lewis Center for the Arts at Princeton University, Gary describes her process: > I am simultaneously creating and destroying, remaking and unmaking. My > intimate interaction with the archive... expresses my desire to be a part of > it, to make my presence felt in and on that history while also interrogating > it. Gillespie notes that \"Gary renders film blackness as cinema in the wake, an assemblage of work that poses new circuits and aesthetic accountings of blackness, sociality, and obliteration.\" In June 2013, Gary was among the founding members of the New Negress Film Society, a collective of black women filmmakers that seeks to create a community and raise awareness of black female voices and stories in the film industry. Gary earned her MFA in Social Documentary Filmmaking at the School of Visual Arts. She also completed a Dual Bachelor of Arts in Documentary Film Production and Africana Studies at Brooklyn College.
