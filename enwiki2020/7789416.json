    "text": "Real Live Roadrunning is a collaborative live album by British singer- songwriter and guitarist Mark Knopfler and American singer-songwriter Emmylou Harris, released on 14 November 2006 by Mercury Records and Universal Music internationally, and by Warner Bros. Records in the United States. The album was recorded live on 28 June 2006 at the Gibson Amphitheatre in Los Angeles, at the end of their summer tour in support of their critically acclaimed album, All the Roadrunning. Real Live Roadrunning was released as a combined CD/DVD. ==Artwork== The album cover is the second album release that prominently features Knopfler's National Style 0 Resonator guitar, the same that is featured on the cover of Brothers in Arms, the top-selling album with his former band, Dire Straits. ==Critical reception== In his review for AllMusic, James Christopher Monger gave the album three out of five stars, writing that the musicianship \"is as flawless as expected, but there's not a whole lot to separate the tunes here from their studio sisters.\" Mongers concluded, \"The accompanying DVD is a much better example of the pair's quiet dynamic, allowing both the duo and its talented band a broader spectrum on which to emit their wry tales of love, loss, and life.\" In his review for The Music Box, John Metzger gave the album three and a half out of five stars, writing that although the performances are \"impeccable\", the set remains \"a flawed affair\". Metzger believed that the songs and arrangements are too similar to the studio versions on All the Roadrunning, and that the differences between the live versions and the studio versions are mostly subtle. Metzger believed that the true highlights of Real Live Roadrunning are the renewed versions of songs taken from the solo works of Knopfler and Harris, such as \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"Speedway at Nazareth\", and \"Red Dirt Girl\". Metzger concluded, \"Understandably, in transforming their work for the stage, Knopfler and Harris were forced to swap subtlety for zeal, but as the accompanying video makes clear, they still succeeded in retaining the charming intimacy that made All the Roadrunning such a superlative collection in the first place.\" ==Track listing== All songs were written by Mark Knopfler, except where indicated. ==Personnel== ;Music * Mark Knopfler \u2013 guitar, vocals * Emmylou Harris \u2013 guitar, vocals * Guy Fletcher \u2013 keyboards * Richard Bennett \u2013 guitar * Danny Cummings \u2013 drums * Stuart Duncan \u2013 fiddle, mandolin * Matt Rollings \u2013 keyboards * Glenn Worf \u2013 bass ;CD Production * Guy Fletcher \u2013 producer, engineer, mixing * Richard Cooper \u2013 assistant engineer * Graham Meek \u2013 assistant engineer * Bob Ludwig \u2013 mastering * Danny Clinch \u2013 photography * Stephan Walker \u2013 art direction * Mark Holly \u2013 design ==DVD== Real Live Roadrunning is a collaborative live concert DVD by British singer-songwriter and guitarist Mark Knopfler and American singer-songwriter Emmylou Harris, released on 14 November 2006 by Mercury Records and Universal Music internationally, and by Warner Bros.
