History of Cities and Villages of the Ukrainian SSR. Supposedly near village Mykulychyn settled a ranaway from the army of Crown of Poland by name Vorokhta. The main population consisted of peasants who were engaged in growing livestock, land cultivation, handcraft industries. The local population actively supported the anti-Polish Opryshky uprising which was taking place in the vicinity until mid 19th century. Following the 1848 Spring of Nations, in Austria was abolished serfdom, yet big landowners remained in Vorokhta with one owning up to 800 morgen of polonyna. Due to difficult economic situation many local soon began finding place to earn money elsewhere immigrating to countries of the New World, Canada, Brazil, Argentina.

In the beginning of the 20th century there also was activated socially political and cultural life and the town was visited by number of Ukrainian writers such as Marko Cheremshyna and Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky. In 1903 in Vorokhta was established a local branch of Galician-based Ukrainian educational organization of Prosvita. Already during World War I, Vorokhta became a place of battle actions. During times of the restored Poland it became a popular mid-upland climatic resort and tourist attraction. In September 1939 Vorokhta became occupied by Soviet troops during the 1939 Soviet occupation of Poland and in November of the same year became part of Ukraine (at that time the Ukrainian SSR). In 1960 Vorokhta was granted status of urban-type settlement. The area of Vorokhta was in the mid-14th century annexed by the Kingdom of Poland, and remained in Poland until 1772 (see Partitions of Poland).
