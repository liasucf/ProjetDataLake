    "text": "Penaeus monodon, commonly known as the giant tiger prawn,Asian tiger shrimp, black tiger shrimp, and other names, is a marine crustacean that is widely reared for food. Tiger prawns displayed in a supermarket ==Taxonomy== Penaeus monodon was first described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1798. That name was overlooked for a long time, until 1949 when Lipke Holthuis clarified to which species it referred. Holthuis also showed that P. monodon had to be the type species of the genus Penaeus. ==Description== Females can reach about long, but are typically long and weigh ; males are slightly smaller at long and weighing . The carapace and abdomen are transversely banded with alternative red and white. The antennae are grayish brown. Brown pereiopods and pleopods are present with fringing setae in red. ==Distribution== Its natural distribution is the Indo-Pacific, ranging from the eastern coast of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, as far as Southeast Asia, the Pacific Ocean, and northern Australia. It is an invasive species in the northern waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean off the southern US. === Invasive species === The first occurrence of P. monodon in the U.S. was in November 1988. Close to 300 shrimp were captured off the South Eastern shore after an accidental release from an aquaculture facility. This species can now be caught in waters from Texas to North Carolina. Although P. monodon has been an invasive species for many years, they have yet to grow large established populations.Knott, D.M., P.L. Fuller, A.J. Benson, and M.E. Neilson, 2019, Penaeus monodon: U.S. Geological Survey, Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database, Gainesville, FL However, escapes in other parts of the world have led to established P. monodon populations, such as West Africa, Brazil, and the Caribbean.Fuller, P., Knott, D., Kingsley-Smith, P., Morris, J., Buckel, C., Hunter, M., & Hartman, L.

Juvenile P. monodon are generally found in sandy estuaries and mangroves, and upon adulthood they move to deeper waters (0- 110 meters) and live on muddy or rocky bottoms.FAO-FIRA, 2010. \"Giant Tiger Prawn Home\" (On- line). Accessed April 15, 2019 at http://affris.org/giant_tiger_prawn/overview.php The P. monodon has shown to be nocturnal in the wild, burrowing into substrate during the day coming out at night to feed.Cultured Aquatic Species Information Programme. Penaeus monodon. Cultured Aquatic Species Information Programme. Text by Kongkeo, H. In: FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Department [online]. Rome. Updated 29 July 2005. [Cited 15 April 2019]. P. monodon typically feed on detritus, polychaete worms, mollusks, and small crustaceans.Chimsung, N. (2014). Maturation diets for black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) broodstock: a review.

Due to their nutrient-rich diet, P. monodon are unable to consume phytoplankton because of their feeding appendages, but they are able to consume senescent phytoplankton.Burford, M. A., Hiep, L.

Retrieved 16 October 2020 from https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735717 They also commence mating at night and can produce around 800,000 eggs. ==Aquaculture== P. monodon is the second-most widely cultured prawn species in the world, after only whiteleg shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei. In 2009, 770,000 tonnes were produced, with a total value of US$3,650,000,000. P. monodon makes up nearly fifty percent of cultured shrimp alone.Khedkar, Gulab Dattarao; Reddy, A Chandrashekar; Ron, Tetszuan Benny; Haymer, David.SpringerPlus; Heidelberg Vol. 2, Iss. 1, (Dec 2013): 1-8. DOI:10.1186/2193-1801-2-671 The prawn is popular to culture because of its tolerance to salinity and very quick growth rate. However, they are very vulnerable to fungal, viral, and bacterial infections.\"Giant Tiger Prawn\". Sea Grant Extension Project. Louisiana State University Diseases such as white spot disease and yellowhead disease have led to a great economic impact in shrimp industries around the globe.Flegel, T. World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology (1997) 13: 433. They can receive transmitted diseases from other crustaceans such as the Australian red claw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus), who is susceptible to yellowhead disease and has shown to transmit it to P. monodon in places like Thailand.Soowannayan, C., Nguyen, G. T., Pham, L. N., Phanthura, M., & Nakthong, N. (2015) Australian red claw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus) is susceptible to yellow head virus (YHV) infection and can transmit it to the black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon). Aquaculture, 445, 63\u201369. P. monodon has been farmed throughout the world including areas such as West Africa, Hawaii, Tahiti and England. For optimal growth, P. monodon is raised in waters between 28\u00b0C and 33\u00b0C. Characteristically for the Penaeus genus, P. monodon has a natural ability to survive and grow in a wide range of salinity, though the optimal salinity for the prawn is around 15-25 ppt.Shekhar, M S; Kiruthika, J; Rajesh, S; Ponniah, A G.Molecular Biology Reports; Dordrecht Vol. 41, Iss. 9, (Sep 2014): 6275-89. While in a farm setting the shrimp are typically feed a compound diet which is produced in dried pellets. By mixing the diet to have compound feeds and fresh feed, P. monodon showed to have better reproductive performance. == Sustainable consumption == In 2010, Greenpeace added Penaeus monodon to its seafood red list \u2013 \"a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries\". The reasons given by Greenpeace was \"destruction of vast areas of mangroves in several countries, over-fishing of juvenile shrimp from the wild to supply farms, and significant human rights abuses\". ==Basic research== In an effort to understand whether DNA repair processes can protect crustaceans against infection, basic research was conducted to elucidate the repair mechanisms used by P. monodon.Srivastava S, Dahal S, Naidu SJ, Anand D, Gopalakrishnan V, Kooloth Valappil R, Raghavan SC. DNA double-strand break repair in Penaeus monodon is predominantly dependent on homologous recombination. DNA Res. 2017 Apr 1;24(2):117-128. . It was found that repair of DNA double-strand breaks is predominantly carried out by accurate homologous recombinational repair. Another less accurate process, microhomology-mediated end joining is also used to repair such breaks. ==See also== *Macrobrachium rosenbergii, the giant freshwater prawn ==References== Category:Penaeidae Category:Edible crustaceans Category:Commercial crustaceans Category:Crustaceans described in 1798 Category:Taxa named by Johan Christian Fabricius ",
