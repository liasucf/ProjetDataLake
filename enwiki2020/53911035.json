    "text": "Krajmir (; d. 15 June 1389) was a Serbian nobleman who served Prince Lazar (r. 1373\u201389), with the title of vojvoda (general). He was mentioned in Konstantin Mihailovi\u0107's memoirs (1490\u20131501) regarding the Battle of Kosovo (1389), where he was captured and killed together with Lazar by the Ottomans, in front of Bayezid. He was described as being from Toplica. His person has been connected with Krajko, the son of magnate Jovan Oliver (1310\u20131356). It is likely that he is the same as Milan Toplica from folk tradition. ==See also== *Pavle Orlovi\u0107 *Ivan Kosan\u010di\u0107 *Milo\u0161 Obili\u0107 ==References== ==Sources== * * * Category:14th- century Serbian nobility Category:Medieval Serbian military leaders Category:14th-century births Category:1389 deaths ",
