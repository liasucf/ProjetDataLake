    "text": "Patricia Anne Rainone (born January 14, 1962), better known by her stage name Patricia Morrison, is an American retired bass guitarist, singer and songwriter. She worked with Bags, The Gun Club, Fur Bible, The Sisters of Mercy and The Damned. ==Biography== Patricia Anne Rainone was active in the Los Angeles, California punk rock scene in her mid-teens, and was a founding member of The Bags in 1976. She left that band after a fallout with co-founder Alice Bag. She began Legal Weapon in 1980, releasing an EP called No Sorrow in 1981. Morrison joined The Gun Club in 1982, quitting after her second tour with them. She then formed the band Fur Bible with Kid Congo Powers, performing as the opening act for Siouxsie and the Banshees. Australian rocker and vocalist Tex Perkins was also offered a spot in Fur Bible and travelled to the UK to perform in band rehearsals. However, on arrival into the UK, Perkins was denied entry due to him not having secured any form of visa prior to leaving Australia. During this time Morrison was contacted by Andrew Eldritch, asking her to join The Sisters of Mercy. She performed on the 1986 album Gift (released under the group name The Sisterhood) and on The Sisters of Mercy's 1987 album Floodland. According to Jennifer Park: The Sisters of Mercy song \"Lucretia My Reflection\" was written by Eldritch about Morrison. The lyrics compare her to the historical figure of Lucrezia Borgia. She left the band in the early 1990s, claiming money that was owed by Eldritch was not paid. In 1994, Morrison released a solo album, Reflect on This. In 1996, she joined The Damned after bassist Paul Gray was injured by a fan in concert. That same year Morrison married the Damned's lead singer Dave Vanian. After giving birth to Emily Vanian in 2004, Morrison retired from the Damned. In 2020, Morrison provided the voice of the character Annabelle on horror punk band Creeper's sophomore album, Sex, Death & the Infinite Void. ==See also== * List of bass guitarists ==References== ==External links== * http://www.artifixrecords.com/bagsbio.htm 13. artifixrecords.com March 15, 2003 Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:American female singers Category:American rock bass guitarists Category:Women bass guitarists Category:Female punk rock singers Category:Gothic rock musicians Category:The Damned (band) members Category:The Sisters of Mercy members Category:Guitarists from Los Angeles Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:20th-century American women musicians ",
