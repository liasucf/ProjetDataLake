Retrieved 28 November 2007. == Celtic tomb == The history of Clemency goes back to the 1st century BC when the Treveri, a Celtic tribe, inhabited the region around Titelberg, a large oppidum near Rodange. A Celtic funeral chamber measuring 4.30 m by 4.20 m, the largest Gallic tomb ever found, was discovered in 1987 at Clemency. From the offerings in the tomb, it was obviously the burial place of a Celtic nobleman. These included at least ten wine amphorae, an Italic bronze basin, an oil lamp from Campania, an iron grill and some 30 Gallic pots. There was also a chimney from an iron smelter in the chamber testifying to the deceased's association with iron production.Clemency L'\u00e2ge du Fer r\u00e9cent from Luxembourg's National Museum of History and Art.

Information from the P\u00e9tange tourist office explains how one Karl Martell offered Clemency and P\u00e9tange to St. Maximin's Abbey, Trier, in 723. A document dated 1140 reports that P\u00e9tange belonged to the parish of Clemency. This apparently continued to be the case for several hundred years.L'\u00e9glise de P\u00e9tange from S.I.
