    "text": "Barad\u0101n (or al-Barad\u0101n) was a town in Lower Mesopotamia under the Abbasids. The name is said to derive from Persian barda-d\u0101n (\"place of prisoners\"), perhaps a reference to the settlement of Jewish exiles in Babylonia. According to the Arab geographers, it was located east of the Tigris river about due north of Baghd\u0101d. It lay on the road to S\u0101marr\u0101 and beside the Kh\u0101li\u1e63 canal, a branch of the Nahraw\u0101n. Between it and Baghd\u0101d there were two postal stations. For a short time, the Caliph al-Man\u1e63\u016br made his capital at Barad\u0101n before founding the city of Baghd\u0101d as a new capital in 762. Eventually, a gate, a street, a bridge and a cemetery in eastern Baghd\u0101d were named after Barad\u0101n. By about 1300, when the Mara\u1e63\u012bd al-i\u1e6d\u1e6dil\u0101\u02bf, an abridgement of the encyclopedia of Y\u0101\u1e33\u016bt, was compiled, Barad\u0101n was in ruins and completely uninhabited. It probably corresponds to the mound today known as Badr\u0101n. ==Notes== ==Sources== * * Category:Capitals of caliphates Category:Cities in Iraq Category:Iraq under the Abbasid Caliphate ",
