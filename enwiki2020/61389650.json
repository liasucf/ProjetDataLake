    "text": "American League president Lee MacPhail upheld the protest by the Kansas City Royals in the Pine Tar Incident in 1983. A protested game occurs in baseball when a manager believes that an umpire's decision is in violation of the official rules. In such cases, the manager can raise a protest by informing the umpires, and the game continues to be played \"under protest.\" An umpire's judgment call (such as balls and strikes, safe or out, fair or foul) may not be protested. == Rules == In Major League Baseball (MLB), protests are governed by Rule 7.04, \"Protesting Games\". A protested game is reviewed and adjudicated by the league president, or the executive vice president of baseball operations, who may order a game resumed (replayed from the point of the protested decision) only if finding the umpire's decision was in violation of the rules and the decision \"adversely affected the protesting team\u2019s chances of winning the game.\" A well-known example of a protested game in MLB was the Pine Tar Incident in 1983, which is the only time to date that a protested game in the American League has been ordered replayed from the point-of-protest. == Upheld protests in MLB == Upheld protests are a rare event; the below tables list upheld protests in MLB. ===Resumed games=== , there are only 15 known occurrences of a protest being upheld and the game being resumed from the point at which the protest was raised. By comparison, there have been 15 unassisted triple plays in MLB history, also . {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |+ Key |bgcolor=lightgreen|Protesting team won the game |- |bgcolor=lightgrey|Protesting team lost the game |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Upheld protests with game resumed from the point-of- protest |- !Date !Venue !Protesting team !Inning !Opposing team !width=40%|Nature of protest !Initial result !Final !Ref. |- |August 30, 1913 |Baker Bowl, Philadelphia |Philadelphia Phillies |9th (top) |New York Giants |Umpire declared a forfeit due to behavior of Phillies' fans; league vacated forfeit and ordered game played to completion. |bgcolor=lightgrey|Giants win by forfeit |bgcolor=lightgreen|Phillies 8 Giants 6 | |- |July 5, 1920 |Polo Grounds, New York City |Philadelphia Phillies |7th (top) |New York Giants |Placement of runners following a Phillies pop-up that was not caught; one umpire had ruled a force out, the other an infield fly. |bgcolor=lightgrey|Giants 6 Phillies 0 |bgcolor=lightgrey|Giants 13 Phillies 0 | |- |May 28, 1921 |Forbes Field, Pittsburgh |Pittsburgh Pirates |8th (bottom) |Cincinnati Reds |Umpires allowed a rundown to occur after the ball had been thrown into the Reds' dugout and thrown back to a player. |bgcolor=lightgrey|Reds 3 Pirates 2 |bgcolor=lightgreen|Pirates 4 Reds 3 | |- |July 2, 1934 |Wrigley Field, Chicago |St. Louis Cardinals |7th (bottom) |Chicago Cubs |Infield fly was not called on a Cubs' pop-up in front of the plate with the bases loaded and one out. |bgcolor=lightgrey|Cubs 7 |bgcolor=lightgrey|Cubs 7 Cardinals 1 | |- |June 5, 1943 |Sportsman's Park, St. Louis |Philadelphia Phillies |8th (middle) |St. Louis Cardinals |Game called on account of rain; Cardinals' grounds crew did not cover the field properly. |bgcolor=lightgrey|Cardinals 1 Phillies 0 |bgcolor=lightgreen|Phillies 2 Cardinals 1 | |- |June 13, 1943 |Polo Grounds, New York City |New York Giants |9th (top) |Philadelphia Phillies |A Phillies batter deliberately stepped into a pitch, which should be ruled an out, but was not ruled out. |bgcolor=lightgrey|Phillies 6 Giants 3 |bgcolor=lightgreen|Giants 4 Phillies 3 | |- |August 17, 1947 |Shibe Park, Philadelphia |Brooklyn Dodgers |7th (bottom) |Philadelphia Phillies |Deliberate stalling tactics by the Phillies so that the game would be halted due to curfew. |Dodgers 4 Phillies 4 |bgcolor=lightgreen|Dodgers 7 Phillies 5 | |- |August 25, 1948 |Forbes Field, Pittsburgh |Pittsburgh Pirates |9th (bottom) |Brooklyn Dodgers |Illegal substitution by Brooklyn; pitcher replaced before he had finished pitching to one batter. |bgcolor=lightgrey| Pirates 9 |bgcolor=lightgreen|Pirates 12 | |- |September 22, 1954 |County Stadium, Milwaukee |Cincinnati Reds |9th (top) |Milwaukee Braves |Umpires ruled a Reds baserunner out after batter ran to first on an uncaught third strike (although already out) and drew a throw, which went into the outfield. |bgcolor=lightgrey|Braves 3 Reds 1 |bgcolor=lightgrey|Braves 4 Reds 3 | |- |August 1, 1971 |Veterans Stadium, Philadelphia |St. Louis Cardinals |12th (top) |Philadelphia Phillies |Umpires called game after rain delay, reverting 6\u20133 Cardinals lead into 3\u20133 tie (score at end of 11th inning).

The batter, in running the bases, slowed up after seeing it signaled as a home run by another umpire and was thrown out at the plate; this was the basis of the protest. The protest was upheld, however the remedy was not to re-play the game from the point of protest; the league president ruled that the home run would count. As the Dodgers had gone on to score three runs in the bottom of the ninth, this turned a 3\u20132 Dodgers win into a 3\u20133 tie. The tie game stands as an official result, with all individual records counting. A replay of the tied game was held on August 18, 1947, which was won by the Dodgers. |Counted as a tie game and replayed | |} == Notes == == References == ==Further reading== * Category:Baseball terminology ",
