    "text": "The Highfill Community Center, formerly the Highfill School, is a historic school building at 11978 Highfill Avenue in Highfill, Arkansas, at its northeast corner with 4th Street. It is a single-story frame structure, finished with wooden clapboard siding and a hip roof. The main entrance is on one of the short sides, sheltered by a hipped hood and flanked by sash windows. The building was constructed about 1911 to serve as a school for district 71, which covered the town. The school was consolidated into the system of nearby Gentry in 1948, and the building was retained for use as a community center, a role it continues to play today. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Benton County, Arkansas ==References== Category:School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:School buildings completed in 1911 Category:Buildings and structures in Benton County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Benton County, Arkansas ",
