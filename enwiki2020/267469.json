    "text": "Surigao del Sur (Surigaonon: Probinsya nan Surigao del Sur; ; ) is a province in the Philippines located in the Caraga region in Mindanao. Its capital is Tandag City. Surigao del Sur is situated at the eastern coast of Mindanao and faces the Philippine Sea to the east. ==Etymology== There are two hypotheses on the original meaning of \"Surigao\" among linguists, depending on the original root word. If the root word was taken to be sulig (\"sprout\" or \"spring up\"), then Surigao may have derived from suligao (\"spring water\"), likely referring to the Surigao River (known as \"Suligaw\" in Mandaya) that empties at the northern tip of the island of Mindanao. Early historical accounts record the name of the river as Suligao, Surigao, or Zurigan. Another possibility is that it is derived from Visayan surogao or suyogao, meaning \"water current\". From suyog (also sulog or surog), \"current\"; cf. Sinulog, Sulu, and Tausug (Suluk). ==History== historical province of Surigao In precolonial times, the region of Surigao was inhabited by the Visayan Surigaonon people in the coastal areas, as well as Lumad groups in the interiors like the Mandaya, Mansaka, Mamanwa and Manobo. During the Spanish Occupation in 1860, six military districts were created in Mindanao, with Surigao and Agusan forming the \"East District\". In 1870, the district was renamed to \"Distrito de Surigao\". In 1901, Distrito de Surigao became chartered province. Agusan became an independent province in 1907 during the American era, when it was separated from Surigao. ===Independent province=== Surigao del Sur was created as the 56th Philippine province on June 19, 1960 through Republic Act 2786, separated from its mother province, Surigao, on September 18, 1960. At the time of its inception, it was classified as 4th Class province with an annual income of over 300,000.00. Seven years later, because of rapid increase of revenue collection particularly from the logging ventures, it has been reclassified as Ist Class B and in 1980 as Ist Class A with an estimated annual income of around 13,000,000. It has been reclassified as 2nd Class with a revenue adding up to 315,888,300.63. Recaredo B. Castillo was the appointed first governor and subsequently elected governor while Vicente L. Pimentel was the first elected congressman. The province was formed with 13 municipalities. Six more were added, raising the number to 19 with Tandag as the capital. Two of its municipalities have been elevated to cities; the first was Bislig City. In 2007, Tandag was granted cityhood but it was nullified via a controversial decision by the Supreme Court a year later. In 2009, Tandag got back its city status after the court reversed its own ruling on December 22, 2009. ==Geography== Tandag Airport Surigao del Sur is located along the northeastern coast of Mindanao facing the Philippine Sea between 125\u00b040' to 126\u00b020' east longitudes and 7\u00b055' and 9\u00b020' north latitudes.
