    "text": "The 1936 United States presidential election in Florida was held on November 8, 1936. Florida voters chose seven electors, or representatives to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. ==Background== Ever since the disfranchisement of blacks at the beginning of the 1890s, Florida had been a one-party state ruled by the Democratic Party. The disfranchisement of blacks and poor whites by poll taxes in 1889Silbey, Joel H. and Bogue, Allan G.; The History of American Electoral Behavior, p. 210 had left the Republican Party \u2013 between 1872 and 1888 dependent upon black votes \u2013 virtually extinct. With the single exception of William Howard Taft's win in Calhoun County in 1908Robinson, Edgar Eugene; The Presidential Vote; 1896-1932 (second edition); pp. 156-157 Published 1947 by Stanford University Press the Democratic Party won every county in Florida in every presidential election from 1892 until 1916. Only twice \u2013 and never for more than one term \u2013 did any Republican serve in either house of the state legislature between 1896 and 1928. Despite this Democratic dominance and the restrictions on the franchise of the poorer classes due to the poll tax, significant socialist movements were to develop and persist in TampaFord, Edward J.; 'Life on the Campaign Trail: a Political Anthropology of Local Politics' (thesis), published 2008 by University of South Florida, pp. 114-118 and to a lesser extent over other parts of the state, especially against the powerful Ku Klux Klan.Gregory, Raymond F.; Norman Thomas: The Great Dissenter, pp. 150-151 There was also a powerful Prohibitionist movements in older North Florida, which saw the Prohibition Party even win the governorship for one term under the notorious anti-Catholic minister Sidney J. Catts. The 1920, aided by a growing \"Presidential Republican\" vote in southern Florida from migrants from northern states, saw the GOP increase its vote totals above those from traditional Unionists (which Florida entirely lacked) in Texas, Arkansas, Alabama or Georgia.Phillips, Kevin; The Emerging Republican Majority, pp. 210-211, 261 In 1928, Florida, especially the western Panhandle pineywoods, turned dramatically away from the Democratic Party due to the nomination of Catholic Al Smith, with the result that Herbert Hoover became the first Republican to win a statewide election since the end of Reconstruction. However, the Depression and elimination of anti-Catholicism saw a return to normal overwhelming Democratic dominance in 1932. ==Vote== A number of conservative Southern newspapers \u2013 in Florida, the Jacksonville Times-Union \u2013 were opposed to Roosevelt and despite the extreme historical hostility towards the GOP, supported Republican nominee Alf Landon in all but name.Shappard, Si; The Buying of the Presidency?: Franklin D. Roosevelt, the New Deal, and the Election of 1936 (Praeger Series on American Political Culture), p. 115 Nonetheless, a combination of powerful political funding of the Democratic Party from textile and other businesses,Webber, Michael J.; New Deal Fat Cats: Business, Labor, and Campaign Finance in the 1936 Presidential Election, pp. 100-103 and support for FDR's New Deal in the anti-Smith pineywoods,Phillips, The Emerging Republican Majority; p. 262 meant that Landon had no hope of making any gains on Herbert Hoover's performance in 1932. Incumbent President Roosevelt won by 170,869 votes or 52.18%, carrying as in 1932 every county in the state. ==Results== ===Results by county=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:60%; text-align:center;\" |- ! style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| County ! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Franklin Delano Roosevelt Democratic ! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Alfred Mossman Landon Republican ! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Various candidates Write-ins ! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Margin ! style=\"text- align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Total votes castScammon, Richard M.
