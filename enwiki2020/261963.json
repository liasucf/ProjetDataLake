    "text": "Basaseachic Falls (Spanish: Cascada de Basaseachi) on the Basaseachic River is the second-highest waterfall in Mexico, located in the Parque Nacional Basaseachic (Basaseachic Falls National Park) at Ca\u00f1\u00f3n Basaseachic in the Copper Canyon region of northwest Mexico, near Creel, Chihuahua. It is 246 meters (807 ft) tall, second in Mexico only to the Cascada de Piedra Volada (Flying Stone Falls). Basaseachic Falls is located in the high mountains of the Sierra Madre Occidental, in the Municipality of Ocampo, from Basaseachi community and about west of Chihuahua. It is reached via Federal Highway 16 and its surroundings make up the Basaseachic Falls National Park (Parque Nacional Cascada de Basaseachic). The waterfall is made by two streams, Arroyo del Durazno and Arroyo de Basaseachic, which merge in the high mountains and then fall down the canyon wall. Past the falls, the stream is called R\u00edo Candame\u00f1a (Candame\u00f1a River), which is the namesake of the canyon it flows through, Candame\u00f1a Canyon (Ca\u00f1\u00f3n Candame\u00f1a). The Candame\u00f1a River is a tributary of the R\u00edo Mayo (Mayo River). Basaseachic Falls was considered the tallest waterfall in M\u00e9xico until the measurement in September, 1994 of the Cascada de Piedra Volada. Both of these waterfalls are seasonal, drying up in the Spring and Autumn dry seasons. ==References== ==External links== *Cascada de Basaseachi *Cascada de Basaseachi en M\u00e9xico Desconocido Category:Waterfalls of Mexico Category:Plunge waterfalls Category:Landforms of Chihuahua (state) Category:Landforms of Sierra Madre Occidental Category:Tourist attractions in Chihuahua (state) ",
