He was one of the founders of the Icelandic journal Fj\u00f6lnir, which was first published in Copenhagen in 1835. The magazine was used by J\u00f3nas and his fellow Fj\u00f6lnismenn to promote Icelandic nationalism, in the hope of giving impetus to the Icelandic Independence Movement. J\u00f3nas remains one of Iceland's most beloved poets, penning some of the best-known Icelandic poems about Iceland and its people. Since 1996, J\u00f3nas's birthday has been officially recognised in Iceland as the Day of the Icelandic Language. On 16 November each year, the J\u00f3nas Hallgr\u00edmsson Award is awarded to an individual for their outstanding contribution to the Icelandic Language. ==Biography== J\u00f3nas was born in the north of Iceland, in \u00d6xnadalur in Eyjafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur. He was the son of Hallgr\u00edmur \u00deorsteinsson, a curate, and Rannveig J\u00f3nasd\u00f3ttir. He was the third of their four children; his siblings were \u00deorsteinn (born 1800), Rannveig (born 1802) and Anna Margr\u00e9t (born 1815). In 1816 J\u00f3nas' father drowned in a lake and J\u00f3nas was sent to live with his aunt. In 1821 he returned home to \u00d6xnadalur to be confirmed, before going away to a school in Skagafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, where he was taught by the Reverend Einar H. Thorlacius. He studied there for two years, and won a scholarship to attend the school at Bessasta\u00f0ir for a further six. After passing his final examinations in 1829, J\u00f3nas moved to Reykjav\u00edk and was employed by a sheriff as a clerk, living in his home. During this time, he also worked as a defence lawyer. It is said that sometime in the winter of 1831\u20131832, J\u00f3nas proposed to a woman called Christiane Knudsen, but he was rejected. He was heartbroken. In 1832 he sailed to Denmark, and passed the entrance exam for the University of Copenhagen. He began working for a law degree, but after four years switched to literature and natural sciences, excelling in both subjects. In 1835, along with fellow Icelandic students Brynj\u00f3lfur P\u00e9tursson, Konr\u00e1\u00f0 G\u00edslason and T\u00f3mas S\u00e6mundsson, he founded the patriotic journal Fj\u00f6lnir. After graduation he was awarded a grant from the state treasury to conduct scientific research in Iceland, a project which he worked on from 1839 to 1842. He continued to pursue his interest in the natural history of Iceland, and to work on Fj\u00f6lnir throughout his life, dividing his time between Denmark and research trips to Iceland. It was in Fj\u00f6lnir that many of his poems and essays first appeared. J\u00f3nas also worked as a translator of foreign material, including scientific works. In these can be found many of the Icelandic words coined by J\u00f3nas. One of these, for an example, is reikistjarna, meaning planet. This is a compound word from the verb a\u00f0 reika (to wander) and the noun stjarna (star). On 21 May 1845 in Copenhagen, J\u00f3nas slipped on the stairs up to his room and broke his leg. He went to the hospital the next day, but died of blood poisoning, aged only 37. ==Style== J\u00f3nas is considered one of the founding fathers, and best examples, of romanticism in Iceland. The imagery in his poetry was strongly influenced by the Icelandic landscape. He is also known for introducing foreign metres, such as pentameter, to Icelandic poetry. :Charming and fair is the land, ::and snow-white the peaks of the jokuls [glaciers], :Cloudless and blue is the sky, ::the ocean is shimmering bright, :But high on the lave fields, where ::still Osar river is flowing :Down into Almanna gorge, ::Althing no longer is held, :Now Snorri's booth serves as a sheepfold, ::the ling upon Logberg the sacred :Is blue with berries every year, ::for children's and ravens' delight. :Oh, ye juvenile host ::and full-grown manhood of Iceland! :Thus is our forefathers' fame ::forgotten and dormant withal.

While ostensibly a national triumph, the reburial has been argued to have been an enormously problematic exercise in hegemony by Iceland's post-independence elites and \u201cinstead of uniting the nation, the episode uncovered a great divide within the people of Iceland.\u201dJ\u00f3n Karl Helgason, 'A Poet\u2019s Great Return: J\u00f3nas Hallgr\u00edmsson\u2019s Reburial and Milan Kundera\u2019s Ignorance', Scandinavian-Canadian Studies/\u00c9tudes scandinaves au Canada, 20 (2011), 52-61 (p. 53), http://scancan.net/article.pdf?id=helgason_1_20 (PDF), http://scancan.net/article.htm?id=helgason_1_20 (XHTML). Cf. J\u00f3n Karl Helgason, Fer\u00f0alok: Sk\u00fdrsla handa akadem\u00edu (Reykjav\u00edk: Bjartur, 2003). The main campaigner behind this was Sigurj\u00f3n P\u00e9tursson, an admirer of J\u00f3nas who claimed to be in telepathic communication with the dead poet and wanted to re- bury his remains in \u00d6xnadalur, where J\u00f3nas grew up.J\u00f3n Karl Helgason, 'A Poet\u2019s Great Return: J\u00f3nas Hallgr\u00edmsson\u2019s Reburial and Milan Kundera\u2019s Ignorance', Scandinavian-Canadian Studies/\u00c9tudes scandinaves au Canada, 20 (2011), 52-61, http://scancan.net/article.pdf?id=helgason_1_20 (PDF), http://scancan.net/article.htm?id=helgason_1_20 (XHTML). Sigurj\u00f3n came up against serious opposition from a number of the political \u00e9lite, including \u00d3lafur Thors, who was then Prime Minister of Iceland. The government informed him that J\u00f3nas' bones were state property, and would be buried at the national burial ground at \u00deingvellir, alongside the poet Einar Benediktsson. However, the government proved unwilling to finance the excavation and transportation. Sigurj\u00f3n covered most of the cost, even paying for Matth\u00edas \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson, the director of the National Museum, to oversee the excavation. The process was a lengthy one, because a father and son had been buried on top of J\u00f3nas in 1875, and another couple in 1900, and they needed to be excavated first. Finally, Sigurj\u00f3n was able to transport the remains to Iceland. He drove north with them, intending to bury them in \u00d6xnadalur in defiance of the government, but the priests there refused to perform the rites. The coffin stood in a church for a week before being driven back south and buried in the government's chosen spot on 16 November, J\u00f3nas' birthday. Since 1996, the date has been celebrated in Iceland as Icelandic Language Day. The controversy, its motivations and outcomes were satirised by, amongst others, Halld\u00f3r Laxness's 1948 novel At\u00f3mst\u00f6\u00f0in and Milan Kundera's Ignorance.J\u00f3n Karl Helgason, 'A Poet\u2019s Great Return: J\u00f3nas Hallgr\u00edmsson\u2019s Reburial and Milan Kundera\u2019s Ignorance', Scandinavian-Canadian Studies/\u00c9tudes scandinaves au Canada, 20 (2011), 52-61 (p. 53), http://scancan.net/article.pdf?id=helgason_1_20 (PDF), http://scancan.net/article.htm?id=helgason_1_20 (XHTML).
