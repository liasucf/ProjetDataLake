    "text": "Saint Odran (fl. 430) was the charioteer of Saint Patrick and the first Christian martyr in Irish history. There are two different versions given about Odran\u2019s martyrdom. The first, in the Vita tripartita Sancti Patricii, states that on the borders of the future counties of Kildare and Offaly, the chieftain of that district, Failge Berraide, worshiped the pagan god Crom Cruach and vowed to avenge the god\u2019s destruction at Magh Sl\u00e9cht by killing Patrick. Odran overheard the plot, and as he and Patrick set out in the chariot to continue their journey, requested that he be allowed to hold the place of honour instead of Patrick, who granted his wish; scarcely had they set out when a lance pierced Odran's heart, who by changing places saved Patrick's life. The second version, contained in the pseudo-historical prologue (PHP) to the Senchas M\u00e1r, the High-King L\u00f3egaire mac N\u00e9ill (died 462) suggests dispatching an assassin to kill someone from Patrick's household in order to test his preaching of forgiveness., a critical text of the PHP, based on manuscripts A B C D. The assassin is identified as King L\u00f3egaire's brother Nuada (or nephew (?)) in the second paragraph quoted below, it being a paraphrase of the beginning sections of the PHP. (Appendix II). Heading: 'the reason for the composition of the poem', text and translation. From manuscript C (Harleian 432). > The cause of the Senchus [Mor] having been composed was this:\u2014Patrick came > to Erin to baptize and to disseminate religion among the Gaedhil, i.e. in > the ninth year of Theodosius and in the fourth year of Laeghaire, King of > Erin, son of Niall. But the cause of the Poem having been composed was as > follows:\u2014Laeghaire ordered his people to kill a man of Patrick's people; and > Laeghaire agreed to give his own award to the person who should kill the > man, that he might discover whether he (Patrick) would grant forgiveness for > it. And Nuada Derg, the son of Niall, the brother of Laeghaire, who was in > captivity in the hands of Laeghaire, heard this, and he said that if he were > released and got other rewards, he would kill one of Patrick's people. And > the command of Laeghaire's cavalry was given him, and he was released from > captivity, and he gave guarantee that he would fulfil his promise; and he > took his lance and went towards the clerics, and hurled the lance at them > and slew Odran, Patrick's charioteer. St. Patrick then asked the Chief Ollam of Ireland, Dubhthach moccu Lughair to try the case, and this places the poet in a quandary because if he didn't impose an eric-fine this would seem an affront to Patrick, while if he did impose an eric, it would be an affront to God. However, Patrick assured him he would be inspired by God to speak what is right, and Dubhthach, after reciting the Senchus Mor as poetry,, PHP\u00a7\u00a74\u20137. text pp. 11\u201312, trans. pp. 18\u201319. encompassing the Brehon law of Ireland, also referred to here as Patrick's law. pronounced judgment on the killer Nuada, who was condemned to death, though his soul went to Heaven. Thus was the earliest judgement on the conflicting values of Christian and pagan laws in Ireland. Saint Odran's feast-day is 19 February. Due to the similarity of the name some people have identified Odran with Odhran of Iona. There is a link in the tradition that both men voluntarily sacrificed themselves in assisting the work of a greater saint. ==Explanatory notes== ==References== === Citations === === Sources === * Binchy, D.
