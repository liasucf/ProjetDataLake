    "text": "The Mine Workers' Union of Canada was a trade union in the mining sector in Canada. MWUC was affiliated to the Workers' Unity League, and lasted for approximately a decade. ==Founding== MWUC was founded in 1925, as Alberta rank and file unionists broke away from the United Mine Workers of America District 18. Several of the founders of the union were cadres of the Communist Party of Canada.Worley, Matthew. In Search of Revolution: International Communist Parties in the Third Period. London: Tauris, 2004. p. 223 By September 1926 MWUC was the largest miners' union in Alberta, with around 4,000 members in fifteen camps.Caragata, Warren. Alberta Labour A Heritage Untold.

The Bienfait-Estevan miners lived in miserable conditions, but the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada had paid little attention to them. MWUC sent its organizers to Bienfait- Estevan. MWUC was able to mobilize a large majority of local miners, preparing for a strike. The mine owners rejected negotiations, and the mayor of Estevan prohibited manifestations by MWUC. When the MWUC took to the streets to protest, they were met with police fire. Three people were killed on September 29, 1931. Twelve miners were arrested in the aftermath. Following these events, MWUC lost its foothold in the area.Morton, Desmond. Working People: an Illustrated History of the Canadian Labour Movement. Montreal [u.a.]: McGill- Queen's Univ. Press, 1998. pp. 143-144 ==Registration== MWUC was registered with the Canadian authorities on March 19, 1926. The registration was cancelled by the Department of Secretary of State on August 22, 1935.Abella, Irving M. On Strike; Six Key Labour Struggles in Canada, 1919-1949.
