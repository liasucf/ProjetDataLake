He obtained a bachelor's degree in botany from Obafemi Awolowo University in the early 1960s before joining the Nigerian film industry. ==Career== He began his acting career playing the lead role of Odewale in The Gods Are Not To Blame, a 1968 play by the Nigerian playwright Chief Ola Rotimi. The play was an adaptation of the Greek classic Oedipus Rex. He also played the lead role in The Village Headmaster, Nigeria's longest- running television soap opera from 1968 to 1988, scripted by Olusegun Olusola. On October 11, 2012, Robinson called on the Federal Government of Nigeria to ban Chinua Achebe's novel Things Fall Apart in Nigerian schools, following the publication of Achebe's controversial memoir There Was a Country: A Personal History of Biafra. ==Death== Robinson died of a heart attack on May 20, 2015 at Ayodele Hospital in the Ifako Ijaiye local government area of Lagos.
