    "text": "Charlie George Wakefield (born 23 May 2000) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Chesterfield. ==Club career== Wakefield started his career in the academy of Chesterfield, and made his debut in the senior team on 17 April 2017, in a 3\u20131 loss to Scunthorpe United in EFL League One, a result that sealed the club's relegation to EFL League Two. He signed his first professional contract in the summer. On 20 August 2018, Wakefield was loaned to Sheffield, in order to obtain some first-team experience. He was recalled by the club in October, with manager Martin Allen citing Wakefield's dropping to the bench following scoring a goal in the previous match against Worksop Town as reason for his return. In May 2019 Wakefield was offered and accepted a new contract to play for Chesterfield F.C. during the 2019/2020 season. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !rowspan=\"2\"|Division !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|EFL Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=4|Chesterfield |2016\u201317 |League One |1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- |2017\u201318 |League Two |1||0||0||0||0||0||2||0||3||0 |- |2018\u201319 |National League |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |2019\u201320 |National League |1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||1||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !3!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!2!!0!!5!!0 |} ==References== Category:2000 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Derby Category:English footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Chesterfield F.C. players Category:English Football League players ",
