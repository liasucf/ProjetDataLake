He primarily releases his music through Hospital Records, the UK-based independent drum and bass music label. His DJ name was Spyder, but two months before the release of his first track he had to change it because another producer from America also released an EP under the same name. He left the last three letters out and changed his name to S.P.Y or SPY. ==Music career== S.P.Y moved to London from S\u00e3o Paulo initially to pursue a career as graphic designer in 2003. In that time he hosted a club night in Camden. It was really small, so nobody sent him music. He then decided to create music himself, using the Mac he bought for his graphic work. He got his first single released by Metalheadz in 2005 and with a release on Hospital\u2019s Medschool imprint following in 2006. He collaborated with various artist and delivering remixes before signing to Hospital Records in 2012. Hospital released his first album, What The Future Holds. This album won the award in the category \"best album\" at the Drum & Bass Awards 2012. In 2013 S.P.Y was selected to write the theme song for the 2014 Street Child World Cup in collaboration with London Elektricity and Diane Charlemagne. S.P.Y released his second album, Back To Basics in 2014, in two parts because he had a lot of tracks to choose from. In January 2015 S.P.Y was selected to create the Essential Mix for BBC Radio 1. ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Album title !
