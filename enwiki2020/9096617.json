    "text": "ICC World Cricket League Division Four forms part of the World Cricket League (WCL) system. Like all other divisions, WCL Division Four is contested as a standalone tournament rather than as an actual league. The inaugural Division Four tournament was held in 2008, hosted by Tanzania. Subsequent tournaments have been held in 2010 (in Italy), 2012 (in Malaysia), 2014 (in Singapore), and 2016 (in the United States). Both the number of teams (six) and tournament format (round-robin followed by playoffs) have remained unchanged between editions. Because the WCL operates on a system of promotion and relegation, teams generally only participate in one or two Division Four tournaments before being either promoted to Division Three or relegated to Division Five. In total, sixteen teams have played in at least one Division Four tournament. Afghanistan and Hong Kong, the inaugural Division Four finalists, have gone on to much greater success, both currently holding One Day International (ODI) status. ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\" |- ! rowspan=2 width=10%|Year ! rowspan=2 width=15%|Host(s) ! rowspan=2 width=15%|Venue(s) ! colspan=3|Final |- ! width=18%|Winner ! width=24%|Result ! width=18%|Runner-up |- style=\"background:#ddeeff\" | 2008 | | Dar es Salaam | 179 (49.4 overs) | Afghanistan won by 57 runs scorecard | 122 (45 overs) |- | 2010 | | Bologna | 188/2 (21.4 overs) | United States won by 8 wickets scorecard | 185/9 (50 overs) |- style=\"background:#ddeeff\" | 2012 | | Kuala Lumpur | 147/2 (28 overs) | Nepal won by 8 wickets scorecard | 145 (48.1 overs) |- | 2014 | | Singapore | 235/7 (50 overs) | Malaysia won by 57 runs scorecard | 178 (46.1 overs) |- style=\"background:#ddeeff\" | 2016 | | Los Angeles | 208 (49.4 overs) | United States won by 13 runs scorecard | 195/9 (50 overs) |- | 2018 | | Kuala Lumpur Bandar Kinrara | 8 points | Uganda won on points table | 6 points |} ==Performance by team== ;Legend * \u2013 Champions * \u2013 Runners-up * \u2013 Third place *Q \u2013 Qualified * -- Hosts {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center; font-size:90%\" ! width=150|Team ! 2008 ! 2010 ! 2012 ! 2014 ! 2016 ! 2018 ! next !
