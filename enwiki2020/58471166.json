    "text": "Duke Treadmill Score is one of the tools for predicting the risk of ischemia or infarction in the heart muscle. The calculation is done based on the information obtained from an exercise test by this formula: :[exercise duration by Bruce protocol] - [ 5 \u00d7 (maximal ST elevation or depression)] - [4 \u00d7 (treadmill angina index)] In which, the exercise duration is written in \"minutes\" and the ST changes in \"millimetres\". Angina index will be zero if no pain appears during the exercise, one if the pain is limited to the exercise period (typical angina), and two if non-limiting pain occurs which will be a reason to stop exercise test. in One year mortality for the results of the Duke treadmill score in one study has been reported as: :less or equal to -11: 5.25% :4 to -10: 1.25% :more or equal to 5: 0.25% ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * * * * * * Category:Cardiac anatomy Category:Cardiology Category:Heart diseases ",
