    "text": "The Central Junior League (Polish language: Centralna Liga Junior\u00f3w, CLJ) is the highest level in Polish Under-19 football. Created in mid-2013, it replaced Mloda Ekstraklasa. The winner of the CLJ advances to the UEFA Youth League. == History == First tournament of Polish U-19 championship took place in the summer of 1936, see Football Junior Championships of Poland. The formula of the U-19 games changed several times. In some years, there was a final match, taking place before an international game featuring the national team of Poland, while on other occasions, there was a final tournament, featuring four top U-19 teams, winners of local competitions. At regional level, the championships were organized by local branches of Polish Football Association (PZPN). In the summer of 2007, the so-called M\u0142oda Ekstraklasa (Young Ekstraklasa) was formed. It was contested by players 21 years of age and under, also each team was allowed three players over this age limit. Despite the creation of M\u0142oda Ekstraklasa, games of the U-19 national championships continued on regional levels: winners of local competitions played each other in the play-off series. == 2012-2013 == In the summer of 2012, the Macroregional League of Older Juniors (Liga Makroregionalna Junior\u00f3w Starszych, U-19) and the Macroregional League of Younger Juniors (Liga Makroregionalna Juniorow M\u0142odszych, U-17) were created. Both leagues had 48 teams, divided into four groups of 12 teams (each group covered four Polish provinces). In the U-19 leagues, winners of their respective groups were the teams of Legia Warszawa, Arka Gdynia, Ruch Chorz\u00f3w and Cracovia Krak\u00f3w. All four played in a final tournament, which took place in mid-June 2013 in Grudzi\u0105dz and \u015awiecie. The tournament was won by Legia, which became the 2013 U-19 Champion of Poland. In the U-17 leagues, winners of their groups were the teams of Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w, Zawisza Bydgoszcz, Polonia Warszawa and Gwarek Zabrze. The final tournament featuring these teams took place in June 2013 in the area of Rzesz\u00f3w, with Wis\u0142a Krakow becoming the 2013 U-17 Champion of Poland. == 2013-2014 == In the summer of 2013, the Central Junior League was officially formed by the PZPN.
