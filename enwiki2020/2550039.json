    "text": "\"Honky Tonk Women\" is a 1969 hit song by the Rolling Stones. It was a single- only release, available from 4 July 1969 in the United Kingdom, and a week later in the United States (although a country version called \"Country Honk\" was later included on the album Let It Bleed). It topped the charts in both nations. The song is on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. ==Inspiration and recording== The song was written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards while on holiday in Brazil from late December 1968 to early January 1969, inspired by Brazilian \"caipiras\" (inhabitants of rural, remote areas of parts of Brazil) at the ranch where Jagger and Richards were staying in Mat\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Paulo. Two versions of the song were recorded by the band: the familiar hit which appeared on the 45 single and their collection of late 1960s singles, Through the Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2); and a honky-tonk version entitled \"Country Honk\" with slightly different lyrics, which appeared on Let It Bleed (1969). Thematically, a \"honky tonk woman\" refers to a dancing girl in a western bar who may work as a prostitute; the setting for the narrative in the first verse of the rock-and-roll version is Memphis, Tennessee: \"I met a gin soaked bar- room queen in Memphis\", while \"Country Honk\" sets the first verse in Jackson, Mississippi: \"I'm sittin' in a bar, tipplin' a jar in Jackson\".The Rolling Stones \"Honky Tonk Women\". Time Is on Our Side. (accessed 19 May 2007). The band initially recorded the track called \"Country Honk,\" in London in early March 1969. Brian Jones was present during these sessions and may have played on the first handful of takes and demos. It was his last recording session with the band. The song was transformed into the familiar electric, riff-based hit single \"Honky Tonk Women\" sometime in the spring of 1969, prior to Mick Taylor's joining the group. In an interview in the magazine Crawdaddy!, Richards credits Taylor for influencing the track: \"... the song was originally written as a real Hank Williams/Jimmie Rodgers/1930s country song. And it got turned around to this other thing by Mick Taylor, who got into a completely different feel, throwing it off the wall another way.\" However, in 1979 Taylor recalled it this way: \"I definitely added something to Honky Tonk Women, but it was more or less complete by the time I arrived and did my overdubs.\" \"Honky Tonk Women\" is distinctive as it opens not with a guitar riff, but with a beat played on a cowbell. The Rolling Stones' producer Jimmy Miller played the cowbell for the recording. The concert rendition of \"Honky Tonk Women\" on Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! (1970) differs significantly from the studio hit, with a markedly dissimilar guitar introduction and the first appearance on vinyl of an entirely different second verse. During the North American leg of the 1989 Steel Wheels tour, a pair of 60-foot tall inflatable Honky Tonk women were cued to appear and bob to the music just before the first chorus. There was an animated live visual for this song when it was performed in concert around 2002 and 2003. It featured a topless woman riding on the Rolling Stones tongue who was seen in the beginning of the concert. ==Release== The single was released in the UK the day after the death of founding member Brian Jones, with \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" as the single's B-side. In the UK, it remained on the charts for seventeen weeks, peaking at number one for five weeks. It remains the band's last single to reach number one in their home country. The song also topped the US Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks from 23 August 1969. It was later released on the compilation album Through the Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2) in September. Billboard ranked it as the No. 4 song overall for 1969. At the time of its release, Rolling Stone magazine hailed \"Honky Tonk Women\" as \"likely the strongest three minutes of rock and roll yet released in 1969\". It was ranked number 116 on the list of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in April 2010. The song was later put into the track listing for the video game Band Hero. In 2014, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. ==Personnel== ;The Rolling Stones *Mick Jagger \u2013 lead vocals *Keith Richards \u2013 lead guitar, rhythm guitar, background vocals *Mick Taylor \u2013 lead guitar *Bill Wyman \u2013 bass *Charlie Watts \u2013 drums ;Additional personnel *Ian Stewart \u2013 piano *Jimmy Miller \u2013 cowbell *Steve Gregory and Bud Beadle \u2013 saxophones *Reparata and the Delrons \u2013 background vocals *Nanette Workman \u2013 background vocals (credited as \"Nanette Newman\") *Doris Troy \u2013 background vocals ==Charts and certifications== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! style=\"width:20em;\"|Chart (1969) !Peak position |- |Australia (Go-Set) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- | |- | |- | |- |Denmark (IFPI) |align=\"center\"|1 |- | |- | |- |Italy (FIMI) |align=\"center\"|18 |- | |- |New Zealand (Listener) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|1 |- | |- |align=\"left\"|Spain (AFYVE) |align=\"center\"|5 |- |Sweden (Kv\u00e4llstoppen) |align=\"center\"|2 |- | |- | |- | |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1969) ! style=\"text- align:center;\"|Rank |- |Canada | style=\"text-align:center;\"|16 |- |US Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|4 |} ===All-time charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !

As noted above, the country arrangement was the original concept of \"Honky Tonk Women\". \"Country Honk\" was recorded at Olympic Studios. Byron Berline played the fiddle on the track, and has said that Gram Parsons was responsible for him being chosen for the job (Berline had previously recorded with Parsons' band the Flying Burrito Brothers). Producer Glyn Johns suggested that Berline should record his part on the pavement outside the studio to add ambiance to the number. Sam Cutler, the Rolling Stones' tour manager, performed the car horn at the beginning of the track.Cutler, Sam. You Can't Always Get What You Want - My Life with the Rolling Stones, the Grateful Dead and Other Wonderful Reprobates Nanette Workman performs backing vocals on this version (although the album sleeve credits actress Nanette Newman). Berline's fiddle and all vocals were recorded at Elektra. There is bootleg recording in existence that contains neither the fiddle nor Mick Taylor's slide guitar. Richards has repeatedly stated that \"Country Honk\" is how \"Honky Tonk Women\" was originally written. ===Personnel=== The Rolling Stones * Mick Jagger \u2013 vocals * Keith Richards \u2013 acoustic guitar, backing vocals * Mick Taylor \u2013 slide guitar * Charlie Watts \u2013 drums Additional personnel * Byron Berline \u2013 fiddle * Nanette Workman \u2013 backing vocals (credited as \"Nanette Newman\") ==References== ==External links== * Category:The Rolling Stones songs Category:1969 singles Category:Decca Records singles Category:London Records singles Category:Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles Category:UK Singles Chart number-one singles Category:Number-one singles in Australia Category:Number- one singles in New Zealand Category:Number-one singles in Switzerland Category:Irish Singles Chart number-one singles Category:Songs written by Jagger/Richards Category:Song recordings produced by Jimmy Miller Category:Ike & Tina Turner songs Category:Country rock songs Category:The Pogues songs Category:Songs about sexuality Category:1969 songs ",
