It is run at Down Royal over a distance of about 3 miles (4,828 metres), and during its running there are fifteen fences to be jumped. The race is scheduled to take place each year in early November. The event was established in 1999, and it was initially contested over 3 miles and 1 furlong. It was cut to its present distance in 2000, and it was given Grade 1 status in 2002. The Ladbrokes Champion Chase is now the first Grade 1 event of the Irish National Hunt season. It was sponsored by JNwine.com (James Nicholson Wine Merchant) from its inception until the 2018 running. Ladbrokes took over the sponsorship in 2019. ==Records== Most successful horse (2 wins): * Beef or Salmon \u2013 2004, 2006 * Kauto Star - 2008, 2010 * Road to Respect - 2018, 2019 Leading jockey (4 wins): * Ruby Walsh \u2013 Taranis (2007), Kauto Star (2008, 2010), Valseur Lido (2016) Leading trainer (4 wins): * Paul Nicholls \u2013 Taranis (2007), Kauto Star (2008, 2010), Kauto Stone (2012) ==Winners== {| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\" |- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\" !
