    "text": "The long-nosed peccary (Mylohyus nasutus) is an extinct mammal species of the peccary family (Tayassuidae). It is one of two peccary-species that existed in the US-Midwest during the last ice age.Lundelius, E. 1961. Mylohyus nasutus: Long-nosed Peccary of the Texas Pleistocene. Bulletin of the Texas Memorial Museum, vol. 1. == Description == The long-nosed peccary was about 0,75 m (2,5 ft) in height and 67 kg (148 lb) in weight.Mendoza, M., Janis, C. M., Palmqvist, P. 2006. Estimating the body mass of extinct ungulates: a study on the use of multiple regression. Journal of Zoology 270(1):90-101 It had an elongated facial region and long slender legs.Nye, April Season, \"Pleistocene Peccaries from Guy Wilson Cave, Sullivan County, Tennessee.\" (2007). Electronic Theses and Dissertations. Paper 2115. http://dc.etsu.edu/etd/2115 == Habitat and distribution == During the last glacial, long-nosed peccaries were distributed throughout eastern North America with concentrations in Appalachia and Florida. Most fossil localities containing this species are found in the southern and south-eastern U.S., from west Texas to Florida, and north to Pennsylvania. == Ecology and behaviour == Unlike the flat-headed peccary, the long-nosed peccary was probably a solitary animal and did not frequent caves.Tankersley, Kenneth B. 2011. Evaluating the Co-occurrence of Platygonus compressus and Mylohyus nasutus at Sheriden Cave, Wyandot County, Ohio. Current Research in the Pleistocene 28:173-175. ==References== Category:Ungulates ",
