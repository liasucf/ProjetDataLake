    "text": "The Czechoslovak Athletics Championships () was an annual outdoor track and field competition organised by the Czechoslovakia Athletics Association, which served as the national championship for the sport in Czechoslovakia. Typically organised in July or August, the event was first held in 1919 (the first summer after the country's formation) until 1992. The competition was not held in the years from 1938 to 1944 due to World War II and ran for 66 editions in total. It was superseded by the Czech Athletics Championships and Slovak Athletics Championships following the country's dissolution in 1993. Czech and Slovak Republics had sometimes hosted sub-national championships before then.National 5000m Outdoor Champions for Czechoslovakia. Association of Road Racing Statisticians (2009-04-23).
