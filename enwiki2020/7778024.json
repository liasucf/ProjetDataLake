In 1968 he suffered from the high altitude conditions of Mexico and collapsed at the 44th kilometre, which was his only defeat in 86 races between 1967 and 1970. After that he focused on the 20 km distance, and won a European title in this event in 1969, followed by a bronze medal in 1971. In July 1972 he set a world record in the 20 km, but finished only sixth at the 1972 Olympics. He also competed in the 20 km walk in the 1976 Olympics, before retiring the following year. ==References== == External links == * Category:1939 births Category:Living people Category:British male racewalkers Category:English male racewalkers Category:Olympic athletes of Great Britain Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1964 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1968 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic silver medallists for Great Britain Category:World record setters in athletics (track and field) Category:Sportspeople from Colchester Category:European Athletics Championships medalists Category:Medalists at the 1964 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic silver medalists in athletics (track and field) ",
