Philibert-Emmanuel de Froulay was the younger brother of Ren\u00e9 de Froulay, count of Tess\u00e9. He fought in the Franco-Dutch War on several fronts. In 1684, during the War of the Reunions, he served in Flanders. At the outbreak of the Nine Years' War he was sent to fight with his brother in Germany, where he took part in the devastation of the Palatinate. At the end of 1689, he was moved to Flanders. Made a brigadier of the Dragoons on March 10, 1690, he was promoted to Lieutenant General on January 30, 1691, and sent to Ireland to support King James II in the Williamite War in Ireland. He was second in command of the Franco-Irish army at the Battle of Aughrim under the Marquis de St Ruth. When Saint-Ruth was killed during the battle, the chevalier de Tess\u00e9 could not prevent the collapse of his army. He became commander of the French troops during the Siege of Limerick (1691), and signed the Treaty of Limerick for France. After his return in France he fought many more battles, but died as Mar\u00e9chal de camp from dysentery near Cremona on August 20, 1701. == Sources == M\u00e9moires et lettres du mar\u00e9chal de Tess\u00e9 Category:1651 births Category:1701 deaths Category:People from Le Mans Category:Counts of Tess\u00e9 Category:French military personnel of the Nine Years' War Froulay ",
