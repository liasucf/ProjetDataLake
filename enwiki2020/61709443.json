    "text": "Early in the year 1931, the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd, ruled by the House of Saud, engaged in an ill-documented border skirmish against the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen. All known details are provided on page 322 of St John Philby's 1955 book Saudi Arabia, which gives the following account: == Commentary == In an enquiry in 2017, the Correlates of War project was unable to find any further information, and found that The Times did not contain any mention of such incident in all of 1931.
