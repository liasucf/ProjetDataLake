    "text": "Swedish Armoured Troops Cadet and Officer Candidate School (, PKAS) was a school of the Swedish Armoured Troops in the Swedish Army which operated in various forms the years 1942\u20131981. The school was located in Sk\u00f6vde Garrison in Sk\u00f6vde. ==History== The school was established on 28 September 1942 as the Swedish Armoured Troops Officer Candidate School (Pansartruppernas officersaspirantskola, POAS) and was located in Str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s. On 28 September 1945, the school was reorganized into the Swedish Armoured Troops Cadet School (Pansartruppernas kadettskola, PKS). In 1946, the school was co-located with the G\u00f6ta Life Guards (P 1) in Enk\u00f6ping. On 1 April 1961, the school was reorganized into the Swedish Armoured Troops Cadet and Officer Candidate School (Pansartruppernas kadett- och aspirantskola, PKAS). The Government Bill 1973:135 suggested that G\u00f6ta Life Guards should be disbanded. The proposal also suggested that the Swedish Armoured Troops Cadet and Officer Candidate School should be relocated to Ystad or Revinge, and be subordinated to the South Scanian Regiment (P 7). However, the issue of disbanding G\u00f6ta Life Guards was delayed until 1977, when the Riksdag, through the Defence Act of 1977 and the Government Bill 1977/78:65, established the Swedish Armed Forces new basic organization. The G\u00f6ta Life Guards was disbanded on 30 June 1980. With that, the school was relocated to Sk\u00f6vde. There, the Swedish Armoured Troops Cadet and Officer Candidate School was amalgamated with the Swedish Armoured Troops School into a new school, the Swedish Armoured Troops Combat School (Pansartruppernas stridsskola, PS) which was established on 1 June 1981. ==Operations== The school was directly subordinate to the Inspector of the Swedish Armoured Troops, but was in a barracks point of view subordinate to the executive officer (sekundchef) of the G\u00f6ta Life Guards. The school was tasked with training officer candidates from all units within the Swedish Armoured Troops. These underwent two-stage training, first candidate school and second candidate school, then complete their training at the Royal Military Academy. The school was provided with loans of different types of combat vehicles from the armoured units, which was characterized by the fact that Stridsvagn 103 was presence at the school, but not at the G\u00f6ta Life Guards. ==Barracks and training areas== When the school was established as the Swedish Armoured Troops Officer Candidate School (Pansartruppernas officersaspirantskola, POAS), it was placed to Str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s Garrison on 29 September 1942, where it was co-located with the S\u00f6dermanland Regiment (P 10). On 3 April 1946, the school was moved to Enk\u00f6ping Garrison, where it was co- located with G\u00f6ta Life Guards (P 1). The school was placed in the barracks of the Life company before it was moved into a newly built school building within the barracks area on 1 March 1967. On 1 June 1980, the school was transferred to Sk\u00f6vde Garrison. ==Commanding officers== *1942\u20131961: ? *1961\u20131965: Kurt Magnusson *1965\u20131968: Erik Gr\u00f6nberg *1968\u20131969: Stig Barke *1969\u20131972: Nils Gunnar Ahlgren *1972\u20131974: Rune Wrangdahl *1974\u20131979: Birger Ericsson *1979\u20131980: Ingemar Bj\u00f6rnsson ==Names, designations and locations== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Names ! style=\"font- weight:bold;\" | Translation ! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight:bold;\" | From ! ! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight:bold;\" | To |- | style=\"font- style:italic;\" | Pansartruppernas officersaspirantskola | Swedish Armoured Troops Officer Candidate School | 1942-09-28 | \u2013 | 1945-09-27 |- | style=\"font-style:italic;\" | Pansartruppernas kadettskola | Swedish Armoured Troops Cadet School | 1945-09-28 | \u2013 | 1961-03-31 |- | style=\"font- style:italic;\" | Pansartruppernas kadett- och aspirantskola | Swedish Armoured Troops Cadet and Officer Candidate School | 1961-04-01 | \u2013 | 1981-05-31 |- ! style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Designations ! style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | ! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight:bold;\" | From ! ! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight:bold;\" | To |- | POAS | | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1942-09-28 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | \u2013 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1945-09-27 |- | PKS | | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1945-09-28 | \u2013 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1961-03-31 |- | PKAS | | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1961-04-01 | \u2013 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1981-05-31 |- ! style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Locations ! style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | ! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight:bold;\" | From ! ! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight:bold;\" | To |- | Str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s Garrison | | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1942-09-28 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | \u2013 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1946-04-02 |- | Enk\u00f6ping Garrison | | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1946-04-03 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | \u2013 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1980-05-31 |- | Sk\u00f6vde Garrison | | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1980-06-01 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | \u2013 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1981-05-31 |} ==See also== *Swedish Armoured Troops School ==References== ===Notes=== ===Print=== * * * ==Further reading== * * Category:Defunct schools in Sweden Category:Military education and training in Sweden Category:Military units and formations established in 1942 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1981 Category:Educational institutions established in 1942 Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 1981 Category:1942 establishments in Sweden Category:1981 disestablishments in Sweden Category:Str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s Garrison Category:Enk\u00f6ping Garrison Category:Sk\u00f6vde Garrison ",
