Under Rodr\u00edguez, the Office of First Lady promoted Costa Rican history and national identity by focusing on three areas: culture, beautification and the arts, and the environment. The focus of her program, which was extended nationwide, varied depending on the local culture and history of the individual cantons. Her office also coordinated other programs, including an eye clinic and construction of a school for children with neurological disabilities, and supported four foundations: Mundo Solidario, Mundo de Opportunidades, Mundo de Luz, and Cadena Mayor. The Office of First Lady receives no national funding from the government of Costa Rica. In response, Rodr\u00edguez solicited private donations to fund her programs and hired some of the office's 60 person staff pro bono. ==References== Category:1942 births Category:Costa Rican beauty pageant winners Category:Costa Rican expatriates in the United States Category:Costa Rican painters Category:Costa Rican women artists Category:Costa Rican sculptors Category:First Ladies and Gentlemen of Costa Rica Category:Living people Category:Miss Universe 1960 contestants Category:People from Chicago Category:People from San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica ",
