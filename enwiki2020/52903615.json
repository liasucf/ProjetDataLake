The review noted an improvement in Nelson's voice, compared to his releases of 2016. Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine concluded, \"It's simply an uncommonly strong latter-day record from Willie Nelson: there isn't a hint of fussiness and the songs and the performances are so understated, they only seem richer with repeated spins\". Rolling Stone praised the album observing that age is a focus of Nelson's new songwriting giving him \"(a) renewed purpose as a lyricist and heightened vulnerability as a vocalist\". Uncut rated the album eight out of ten, and favored Nelson's songwriting, while it called the single \"Still Not Dead\" one of Nelson's \"modern masterpieces\". Popmatters delivered a favorable review, calling it an \"indisputable high point\" of Nelson's latest records.

Paste felt that the release was \"as vital\" as the rest of Nelson's repertoire. Pitchfork summed up the album by calling Nelson \"(a) cosmic joker contemplating mortality with endearing humor and touching honesty\". The Austin American-Statesman opined that it was \"Nelson\u2019s best album since the 1990s\" and attributed its success to \"(a) near-perfect balance between Willie as songwriter and as interpreter\". Sounds Like Nashville added that \"Nelson isn\u2019t going to go quietly in the night. The 'Red Headed Stranger' has never done anything in that fashion, and at age 84, the singer continues to come out swinging on all cylinders.\" ==Commercial performance== The album debuted at number one on Billboard's Top Country Albums chart, selling 34,000 in copies (36,000 equivalent albums in total) in its first week.
