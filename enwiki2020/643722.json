    "text": "Myron Holley Clark (October 23, 1806 - August 23, 1892) was an American politician from the U.S. state of New York. == Biography == ===Early life=== Myron Holley Clark was born in Naples, Ontario County, New York on October 23, 1806. ===Career=== He served in the state's militia as a lieutenant colonel and then entered politics, first serving as President of the then-village of Canandaigua, New York, and eventually becoming Sheriff of Ontario County, New York. Gubernatorial portrait of New York Governor Myron H. Clark. He was a member of the New York State Senate (29th D.) from 1852 to 1854, sitting in the 75th, 76th and 77th New York State Legislatures. At the New York state election, 1854, he was elected Governor of New York in the closest gubernatorial election in New York State history. He was in office from 1855 to 1856. As Governor, Clark was noted for his meddling with militia appointments, causing the resignation of the state Adjutant General John Watts de Peyster. Clark made several attempts to effect prohibition in the state and signed a prohibition law while governor, but the law was declared unconstitutional by the New York Court of Appeals. His steadfast advocating of temperance led to his nomination on the Prohibition ticket to run again for Governor at the New York state election, 1874. He finished in third place, behind Democrat Samuel J. Tilden and the incumbent Republican Governor John Adams Dix. ===Personal life=== Clark died in Canandaigua, New York on August 23, 1892. He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery (Canandaigua, New York). Mary Clark Thompson was his daughter; as a memorial to Clark, in 1915 she presented a scenic and geologically significant tract of land to New York State that is now part of Clark Reservation State Park. Comptroller Clark Williams was his grandson. ==References== * National Governors Association website Category:New York (state) Republicans Category:1806 births Category:1892 deaths Category:Sheriffs of Ontario County, New York Category:New York (state) Whigs Category:Governors of New York (state) Category:New York (state) state senators Category:People from Naples, New York Category:Politicians from Canandaigua, New York Category:New York (state) Prohibitionists Category:American temperance activists Category:Whig Party state governors of the United States Category:19th-century American politicians Category:Activists from New York (state) ",
