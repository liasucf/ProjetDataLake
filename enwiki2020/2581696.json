    "text": "Gottfried Michael Koenig Gottfried Michael Koenig (born 5 October 1926 in Magdeburg) is a contemporary German-Dutch composer. ==Biography== Koenig studied church music in Braunschweig at the , composition, piano, analysis and acoustics at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik Detmold, music representation techniques at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik K\u00f6ln and computer technique at the University of Bonn. He attended and later lectured at the Darmst\u00e4dter Ferienkurse (Darmstadt music summer schools). From 1954 to 1964 Koenig worked in the electronic studio of West German Radio (WDR) producing his electronic compositions Klangfiguren, Essay and Terminus 1 and wrote orchestral and chamber music. Furthermore, he assisted other composers, including Mauricio Kagel, Franco Evangelisti, Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti (Artikulation), Herbert Br\u00fcn and Karlheinz Stockhausen (with the realization of Gesang der J\u00fcnglinge and Kontakte). From 1961 to 1965 Koenig taught at the Gaudeamus Foundation in Bilthoven, and from 1962 to 1964 at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik K\u00f6ln. In 1964 Koenig moved to the Netherlands, where he taught at Utrecht University and was, until 1986, director and later chairman of the electronic music studio, which became the Institute of Sonology . Here he developed his computer composition programs Project 1 (1964) and Project 2 (1966), designed to formalise the composition of musical structure-variants. Both programs had a significant impact on the further development of algorithmic composition systems. Among his notable students are Mario Bertoncini, Konrad Boehmer, Karl Gottfried Brunotte, Johannes Fritsch, Annea Lockwood, Tom\u00e1s Marco, Pierre Mari\u00e9tan, Zolt\u00e1n Pongr\u00e1cz, Kees van Prooijen, Atli Heimir Sveinsson, Miguel \u00c1ngel Coria and Jan Vriend. His sound synthesis program SSP (started 1971) is based on the representation of sound as a sequence of amplitudes in time. It makes use of the methods of aleatoric and groupwise selection of elements employed in Project 1 and Project 2. He continued to produce electronic works (Terminus 2, the Funktionen series). These were followed by the application of his computer programs, resulting in chamber music (\u00dcbung for piano, the Segmente series, 3 ASKO Pieces, String Quartet 1987, String Trio) and works for orchestra (Beitrag, Concerti e Corali). Six volumes of his theoretical writings were published between 1991 and 2008 under the title \u00c4sthetische Praxis by Pfau Verlag; an Italian selection appeared under the title Genesi e forma (Rome: Semar, 1995), an English one under the title Process and Form (Hofheim: Wolke, 2018). Koenig taught Algorithmic Composition in 2002/03 at the Technical University of Berlin. His works Terminus 2 and Funktion Gr\u00fcn were selected by the British magazine The Wire in 1978 for its list of . ==References== * ==Further reading== * * * * * * * * * * * * == External links == * * Karlheinz Essl: Zufall und Notwendigkeit.
