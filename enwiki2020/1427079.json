He was the Ordynat of Nie\u015bwie\u017c, Stolnik of Lithuania since 1626, Krajczy of Lithuania since 1630, governor of Brze\u015b\u0107 Litewski Voivodeship since 1631 to 1635, Court Marshal of Lithuania since 1635, Grand Marshal of Lithuania in 1637-1654 and voivode of Po\u0142ock Voivodship since 1654. He also held the title Starost s\u0142onimski, upicki, bras\u0142awski, szadowski, nowowo\u0142y\u0144ski, jurborski, olicki. He married Tekla Anna Wo\u0142\u0142owicz in 1626, Katarzyna Eugenia Tyszkiewicz in 1639 and Lucricia Marie Strozzi in October, 1642 in Warsaw. His marriage to Katarzyna Eugenia Tyszkiewicz, widow of Konstanty Wi\u015bniowiecki's son, led to the conflict between Aleksander Ludwik Radziw\u0142\u0142 and Jeremi Wi\u015bniowiecki over the inheritance of Konstanty. Eventually, Katarzyna defected to Jeremi's side and divorced Aleksander, who was forced to give up his claims. He kept away from politics during the reign of Sigismund III Vasa, but supported W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa, in his election in 1632. However towards the end of his life he distanced himself from W\u0142adys\u0142aw, by opposing his plans of war with Ottomans. ==References== Category:Secular senators of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:Polish Princes of the Holy Roman Empire Category:1594 births Category:1654 deaths Aleksander Ludwik Category:Grand Marshals of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania Category:Court Marshals of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ",
