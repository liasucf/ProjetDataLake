He is the head of the House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107. Alexander is the only child of former King Peter II and his wife, Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark. He held the position of crown prince in the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia for the first four-and-a-half months of his life, from his birth until the declaration of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia later in 1945. Born and raised in the United Kingdom, he enjoys close relationships with his relatives in the British royal family. His godparents were King George VI of the United Kingdom and his daughter, the then-Princess Elizabeth (now Queen Elizabeth II). Through his father Alexander is a direct descendant of Queen Victoria, through his great-great-grandfather Prince Alfred, Duke of Saxe- Coburg and Gotha, Victoria's second eldest son. Maternally he is also a direct descendant of Queen Victoria, through his great-great-grandmother Victoria, Empress of Germany, Victoria's eldest daughter. Alexander is known for his support of monarchism and his humanitarian work. ==Status at birth== As with many other European monarchs during World War II, King Peter II left his country to establish a government-in-exile.Louda; Maclagan (1981), p. 296 He left Yugoslavia in April 1941 and arrived in London in June 1941. The Royal Yugoslav Armed Forces capitulated 18 April. After the Tehran Conference, the Allies shifted support from royalist Chetniks to communist-led Partisans.Fenyvesi (1981), p. 211 Commenting on the event and what happened to his father, Crown Prince Alexander said, \"He [Peter II] was too straight. He could not believe that his allies \u2013- the mighty American democracy and his relatives and friends in London \u2013- could do him in. But that's precisely what happened\".Fenyvesi (1981), p. 212 In June 1944 Ivan \u0160uba\u0161i\u0107, the Royalist prime minister, and Josip Broz Tito, the Communist Partisan leader, signed an agreement that was an attempt to merge the royal government and communist movement. On 29 November 1943, AVNOJ (formed by the Partisans) declared themselves the sovereign communist government of Yugoslavia and announced that they would take away all legal rights from the Royal government. On 10 August 1945, less than a month after Alexander's birth, AVNOJ named the country Democratic Federal Yugoslavia. On 29 November 1945, the country was declared a communist republic and changed its name to People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.Fenyvesi (1981), p. 215 In 1947, all members of Alexander's family except for his grand-uncle Prince George were deprived of their Yugoslavian citizenship and their property was confiscated. As of 8 July 2015 the High Court in Belgrade found that decree 392, issued by the Presidency of the Presidium of the National Assembly on 3 August 1947, which deprived King Peter II and other members of the House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 of their citizenship, was null and void from the moment of its adoption, in the parts pertaining to Crown Prince Alexander, and that all of its legal consequences are thus null and void.Rehabilitation of Crown Prince Alexander ==Birth and childhood== Alexander was born in Suite 212 of Claridge's Hotel in Brook Street, Mayfair, London. The British Government is said to have temporarily ceded sovereignty over the suite in which the birth occurred to Yugoslavia so that the crown prince would be born on Yugoslav territory, though the story may be apocryphal, as there exists no documentary record of this. Another part of the story says that a box of dirt from the homeland was placed under the bed, so the Prince could be born on Yugoslav soil. He was the only child of King Peter II and Queen Alexandra of Yugoslavia. He was christened at Westminster Abbey. His godparents were members of the British royal family, King George VI and Princess Elizabeth, now Queen Elizabeth II. His parents were relatively unable to take care of him, due to their various health and financial problems, so Alexander was raised by his maternal grandmother, Princess Aspasia of Greece and Denmark. He was educated at Trinity School, Institut Le Rosey, Culver Military Academy, Gordonstoun, Millfield and Mons Officer Cadet School, Aldershot, and pursued a career in the British military. ==Military service== Alexander graduated from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in 1966 and was commissioned as an officer into the British Army's 16th/5th The Queen's Royal Lancers regiment, rising to the rank of captain. His tours of duty included West Germany, Italy, the Middle East, and Northern Ireland. After leaving the army in 1972, Alexander, who speaks several languages, pursued a career in international business.The Royal Family of Serbia ==Marriages== Katherine. On 1 July 1972 at Villamanrique de la Condesa, near Seville, Spain, he married Princess Maria da Gloria of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza, from the Brazilian imperial family. They are 4th cousins once removed as both are descendants of Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1785\u20131851) and his wife Princess Maria Antonia von Koh\u00e1ry (1797\u20131862). They have three sons: Peter (born 5 February 1980), and fraternal twins: Philip and Alexander (both born 15 January 1982). By marrying a Roman Catholic, Alexander lost his place in line of succession to the British throne, which he had held as a descendant of Queen Victoria through her second son Alfred, although forfeiture of succession rights on the basis of marriage to a Roman Catholic was retroactively rescinded in 2015. Alexander is also descended from Queen Victoria's eldest daughter Victoria.Louda; Maclagan (1981), p. 286 Table 144 His sons remain in the line of succession to the British throne. Alexander and Maria da Gloria divorced in 1985. Crown Prince Alexander married for the second time, Katherine Clairy Batis, the daughter of Robert Batis and his wife, Anna Dosti, civilly on 20 September 1985, and religiously the following day, at St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church, Notting Hill, London. Since their marriage, she is known as Princess Katherine, as per the royal family's website. ==Return to Yugoslavia== World Heart Day in Belgrade, 2005. Front row, left to right: Tomica Milosavljevi\u0107, Serbia's Minister of Health; Crown Prince Alexander; United States Ambassador to Serbia Michael C. Polt; Mrs. Polt. Back row: Basketball player Vlade Divac. Alexander first came to Yugoslavia in 1991. He actively worked with the opposition to Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and moved to Yugoslavia after Milo\u0161evi\u0107 had been deposed in 2000. On 27 February 2001,News Report of B92 as reproduced on Royal Family website the parliament of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) passed legislation conferring citizenship on members of the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 family. The legislation may also have effectively annulled a decree stripping the family of its citizenship of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) in 1947. The annulment was the topic of some debate. Notably, the FRY was not the successor of the SFRY; rather the FRY was a new state (and was admitted to the United Nations as a new state on that basis). Therefore, the jurisdiction of a new state to annul an action of a different former state was questioned. In effect, the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 family had FRY citizenship conferred upon them, not \"restored\" as such. The FRY legislation also addresses restoration of property to the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 family. In March 2001, the property seized from his family, including royal palaces, was returned for residential purposes with property ownership to be decided by parliament at some later date. He currently lives in the Royal Palace (Kraljevski Dvor) in Dedinje which he has lived there since 17 July 2001 which is an exclusive area of Belgrade. The Palace, which was completed in 1929, is one of two royal residences in the Royal Compound; the other is the White Palace, which was completed in 1936. ===Belief in constitutional monarchy=== Alexander is a proponent of re-creating a constitutional monarchy in Serbia and sees himself as the rightful king. He believes that monarchy could give Serbia \"stability, continuity and unity\". A number of political parties and organizations support a constitutional parliamentary monarchy in Serbia. The Serbian Orthodox Church has openly supported the restoration of the monarchy.Letter from Patriarch Pavle to HRH Crown Prince Alexander II, 29 November 2003 The assassinated former Serbian Prime Minister Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107 was often seen in the company of the prince and his family, supporting their campaigns and projects, although his Democratic Party never publicly embraced monarchy. Crown Prince Alexander has vowed to stay out of politics. He and Princess Katherine spend considerable time engaging in humanitarian work. The Crown Prince has, however, increasingly participated in public functions alongside the leaders of Serbia, the former Yugoslav republics and members of the diplomatic corps. On 11 May 2006, he hosted a reception at the Royal Palace for delegates attending a summit on Serbia and Montenegro. The reception was attended by the Governor of the National Bank of Serbia, as well as ambassadors and diplomats from Slovenia, Poland, Brazil, Japan, United States, and Austria. He later delivered a keynote speech in front of prime ministers Vojislav Ko\u0161tunica and Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107. In the speech he spoke of prospective Serbian membership of the European Union. He told delegates: Following Montenegro's successful independence referendum on 21 May 2006, the re-creation of the Serbian monarchy found its way into daily political debate. A monarchist proposal for the new Serbian constitution has been published alongside other proposals. The document approved in October 2006 is a republican one. The Serbian people have not had a chance to vote on the system of government. The Crown Prince raised the issue of a royal restoration in the immediate aftermath of the vote. In a press release issued on 24 May 2006 he stated: In 2011 an online open access poll by Serbian middle-market tabloid newspaper Blic showed that 64% of Serbians support restoring the monarchy. Another poll in May 2013 had 39% of Serbians supporting the monarchy, with 32% against it. The public also had reservations with Alexander's apparent lack of knowledge of the Serbian language.39 percent of Serbians in favor of monarchy, poll shows . Retrieved 2013-05-12. On 27 July 2015, newspaper Blic published a poll \"Da li Srbija treba da bude monarhija?\" (\"Should Serbia be a monarchy?\"); 49.8% respondents expressed support in a reconstitution of monarchy, 44.6% were opposed and 5.5% were indifferent.ANKETA Da li Srbija treba da bude monarhija?. Blic. (in Serbian). July 2015. On 16 December 2017, Alexander attended with his wife the state funeral of his first cousin once removed, King Michael of Romania in Bucharest, along with other heads of European royal families and invited guests.http://www.romaniaregala.ro/jurnal/familiile-regale-participante-la- funeraliile-regelui-mihai-i/http://www.romaniaregala.ro/jurnal/ziua- funeraliilor-regelui-mihai-i-al-romaniei/ ==Titles, styles, honours and arms== ===Titles and styles=== *17 July 1945 \u2013 29 November 1945: His Royal Highness The Crown Prince of Yugoslavia *29 November 1945 \u2013 Present: His Royal Highness Crown Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia *officially in Serbia: 17 July 2001 \u2013 present: Aleksandar Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 *known in Serbia: 17 July 2001 \u2013 present: Crown Prince Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 *in pretence: 3 Nov 1970 \u2013 4 February 2003: His Majesty The King of Yugoslavia *in pretence: 4 February 2003 \u2013 present: His Majesty The King of Serbia ===Honours=== ====Dynastic==== * House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107: Sovereign of the Royal Order of Saint Prince Lazarus * House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107: Sovereign of the Royal Order of the Star of Kara\u0111or\u0111e * House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107: Sovereign of the Royal Order of the White Eagle * House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107: Sovereign of the Royal Order of the Crown * House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107: Sovereign of the Royal Order of Saint Sava * Brazilian Imperial Family: Knight Grand Cross of the Imperial Order of the Southern Cross * Italian Royal Family: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus * Two Sicilian Royal Family: Knight of the Illustrious Royal Order of Saint Januarius * Two Sicilian Royal Family: Bailiff Knight Grand Cross of Justice with Collar of the Two Sicilian Royal Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George ===Foreign=== * : Commander of the Order of the Legion of Honour * Sovereign Military Order of Malta: Collar of the Order of Merit * : Recipient of the 50th Birthday Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf * : Recipient of the 70th Birthday Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf * : Recipient of the General Service Medal ===\u0415cclesiastical=== *Order of Tsar Constantine (Serbian Orthodox Church) *Order of the Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel (Greek Orthodox Church) *Order of Saint Tsar Nicholas (Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia) *Order of Saint Sava (First Grade) (Serbian Orthodox Church) *Order of St. Prince Lazar (Eparchy of Ra\u0161ka and Prizren, Serbian Orthodox Church) ==References== ; Notes ; Footnotes ==Books, letters and articles== * * * * ==External links== *Official Royal Family website *Royal Mausoleum Oplenac *Crown Prince Alexander II Foundation for Education Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:Yugoslav princes Category:Heirs apparent who never acceded Category:Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty Category:Recipients of the Order of the Rose Category:Pretenders to the Serbian throne Category:People educated at Gordonstoun Category:People educated at Millfield Category:Alumni of Institut Le Rosey Category:Eastern Orthodox Christians from Serbia Category:Knights of the Order of Saint Januarius Category:Knights Grand Cross of Justice of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Vi\u00e7osa Category:Serbian people of Greek descent Category:Serbian people of Danish descent Category:Yugoslav anti-communists Category:Serbian anti- communists Category:Serbian monarchists Category:Recipients of the Order of the Yugoslav Crown Category:Culver Academies alumni ",
