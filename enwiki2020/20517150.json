In 1959, new construction was fronted onto the original brick library that more than doubled the size of the library.

The George Thacher Memorial Library opened in 1893. In 1907 the building was moved to a larger lot and expanded. In 1916 the Ojai Library became affiliated with the Ventura County Library. The library was moved again in 1928 to land donated by Edward Libbey and a new building designed by Carleton Winslow in a Spanish hacienda style. By 1979 the library needed more space. An addition was designed by architects Fisher and Wilde to double the size of the library to and blend with the original Winslow building. Now the library is again in need of an expansion. The Grow Your Library committee was formed in 2006 and is raising money to add a children\u2019s wing and meeting room. === Piru Library === The library in Piru first joined the county library system on February 4, 1916.

Prueter Library, Port Hueneme=== Port Hueneme\u2019s first library was founded by prominent resident, Senator Thomas Bard, in the 1880s but closed a few years later. In 1909, the Women\u2019s Improvement Club reestablished the Hueneme Library which operated as a branch of the Oxnard Library. Ventura County Library began operation of a branch library to serve the Hueneme School District and in 1936, Hueneme Library joined the Ventura County Library system. In 1960, the branch relocated to a new facility. The current facility was built in 1989, providing Port Hueneme residents with a library reflective of the community\u2019s ocean environment, with natural light and ocean wave-inspired Italian glass mosaics by Ventura artist, Helle Scharling-Todd, \u201cdesigned to express the conflicting energies found in the ever-changing sea.\u201d Mosaics representing the tide begin outside the library and continue into the lobby; wave forms are depicted on the far wall inside the library. The building was designed by Scott Ellinwood and incorporates an energy efficient lighting system that makes use of natural light as much as possible (clerestories and windows glazed with high- transmittance, heat absorbing glass allow daylight to be used for interior illumination during the day; sensors switch on electric light as daylight fades). The library has a computer lab and homework center, a copy machine, a microfilm reader printer and a microfiche reader printer. Prueter Library has books in Spanish for both children and adults. Because the library is in the home of the navy base, the library makes an effort to collect materials about Port Hueneme, the Seabees, and the U.S. Navy. The library has some collections of older papers that chronicle the city's history on microfilm, including the Port Hueneme Harbor Bulletin (Jun 1, 1938 \u2013 Aug 8, 1941); the Port Hueneme Herald (Aug 15, 1941 \u2013 May 1, 1942); the Port Hueneme Herald Express (1941\u20131945 with some missing issues and 1946 \u2013 Aug 31, 1951); and the Port Hueneme Pilot (Sep 1951 \u2013 Mar 27, 1963). Annual special events sponsored by the Friends of the Port Hueneme Library include the Spring Carnival, held in late April, with games, prizes, and crafts for children ages 4\u201310. This annual event is a service project of the Teen Advisory Board. Also held annually is the Horror in the Stacks held in late October. The Library and the Teen Advisory Board invite teens (13-17) for a scary stroll through the \u201chaunted\u201d library. There are many preschool storytime programs for ages 0\u20135 and Bilingual storytimes as well. The Friends of the Library have an ongoing book sale in the lobby of the library, with a large book sale held annually in April. === Saticoy Library === The library in the unincorporated community of Saticoy, east of Ventura, first joined the county library system on March 9, 1916. After the H.P. Wright Library in east Ventura closed in 2009, use of the Saticoy branch tripled. In 2015, the library moved into a new facility, a former hardware store that had served as Saticoy's \"unofficial town square.\" The new location provided three times the floor space and more than twice as many computers, better accommodating users of library services and events, such as its popular tutoring program. ==Other Library Systems== The libraries of six cities in Ventura County are not part of the county library system, but are operated by their respective city governments.
