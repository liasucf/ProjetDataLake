On the other hand, Bruce was chosen by the Slovenian staff because of his physique and his \"very Filipino\" characteristics that would stir up competition among the men there.Cruz, Marinel R. Slovenian beauty queen in PBB housemate swap. Philippine Daily Inquirer, April 18, 2007. p. D1 (no online version) To let Filipino viewers know about Bruce's situation in the Slovenian House, some footage from the Slovenian version related to Bruce was also shown, aside from the events inside the Philippine House. English conversations recorded on both Houses were subtitled into Filipino, while any Slovenian conversation and comment was dubbed over by Filipino voice actors to let the Filipino viewers understand better. Below is a list of activities each swapped housemate did in their respective host country's Houses, aside from introductions and trading of basic phrases: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Tina | * Taught the housemates the Slovenian polka. * Cooked a Slovenian desert called a potica. * Learned to properly eat a mango. * Learned from Saicy and Wendy how to sing Pinoy Ako and explain its meaning. * Told by Nel to eat some Filipino street foods, but she refused to eat balut after squirming at the sight of its contents. * Practiced baton twirling together with Beatriz and Saicy. * Acted as Reyna Elena in the House's celebration of the Santacruzan. * Took part in the PBB Fiesta, even finishing the game of palo sebo for her fellow housemates. |- ! Bruce | * Cooked adobo for his fellow housemates. The Slovenian housemates thought it was so delicious, even Sonja, the resident vegetarian, ate it, too. * Taught the housemates tinikling. But since the others had a hard time keeping the rhythm in the dance, they later turned one of the two bamboo poles used in the dance into a limbo pole. * Learned the Slovenian version's theme song. * Built a snowman out of artificial snow (together with his fellow housemates). Real snow could not be provided because winter had already passed in Slovenia. * Signed T-shirts for an upcoming auction. Slovenian viewers already knew about his mother's condition and sales from the auction will be used for her benefit. * Participated in a task which required the housemates to disguise themselves as animals using body paint. Bruce played a cow. |} While Tina left the Philippines without much incident, Bruce left Slovenia with controversy brewing up behind him. Slovenian housemates Miha and Pero made inappropriate remarks about Bruce \u2014 remarks that did not sit well with both Big Brother and the viewers there. Because of that and Pero's \"plan\" of \"stabbing Big Brother,\" Big Brother removed Pero from the Slovenian HousePero je izseljen!, Slovenian Big Brother website and then added Miha to the list of nominees for eviction, which already included Jasmina and Sonja. Tina was later evicted on Day 63 of the Slovenian version, about five weeks after the swap. On Day 125 of the Philippine version, Tina returned to the Pinoy Big Brother house to have a celebratory dinner with the Big 4, Bea, Gee-Ann, Mickey and Wendy. She left the house the same night and participated in the Finale, where she danced various Philippine dances and took part in the awarding ceremony for the Big 4. ==Nomination Table== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%; font-size:90%; line-height:15px;\" |- ! style=\"width:6%\"| ! style=\"width:6%\"|Week 2 ! style=\"width:6%\"|Week 3 ! style=\"width:6%\"|Week 4 ! style=\"width:6%\"|Week 5 ! style=\"width:6%\"|Week 6 ! style=\"width:6%\"|Week 7 ! style=\"width:6%\"|Week 8 ! style=\"width:6%\"|Week 9 ! style=\"width:6%\"|Week 10 ! style=\"width:6%\"|Week 11 ! style=\"width:6%\" colspan=\"2\"|Week 12 Final ! style=\"width:6%\"|Nominations received |- ! style=\"background:#000\" colspan=\"14\"| |- !
