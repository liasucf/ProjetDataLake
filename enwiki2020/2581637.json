    "text": "Melrose Park is a suburb of Sydney, Australia, located 17 kilometres north- west of the Sydney central business district, and is split between the local government areas of the City of Ryde and the City of Parramatta. It is part of the Northern Sydney region. Melrose Park sits on the northern bank of the Parramatta River. ==History== ===Aboriginal culture=== The Wallumedegal Aboriginal tribe lived in the area between the Lane Cove River and Parramatta River, which was known as Walumetta. ===European settlement=== Melrose Park was the name of the large housing estate established in 1937. Melrose Park is named in honour of aviator Charles James Melrose (1913\u20131936). He held a number of flying records, was the only solo flyer to finish the Melbourne Centenary Air Race in 1934 and helped in the unsuccessful search for Sir Charles Kingsford Smith. He died when his plane broke up in turbulence on a charter flight from Darwin to Melbourne. Streets in the suburb also recall other aviators such as Sir Alan Cobham, Jean Batten and Amy Johnson.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 169 == Population == In the 2016 Census, there were 1,574 people in Melrose Park. 68.1% of people were born in Australia and 66.9% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 35.0%, No Religion 22.9% and Anglican 11.4%. == Transport == Melrose Park is served by bus route 524, connecting the suburb to West Ryde and Parramatta. The nearest train station is Meadowbank Station, located in the centre of Meadowbank. Stage 2 of the Parramatta Light Rail is a proposed light rail link between Westmead and Sydney Olympic Park via Parramatta. The project would include the construction of a bridge across the Parramatta River, between Melrose Park and Wentworth Point. == Redevelopment == Redevelopment underway on 20 November 2016. The western part of the suburb located within the City of Parramatta has historically been industrial, including the Australian operations of large pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer and Reckitt Benckiser. In February 2016, Payce Consolidated Limited announced plans for a major urban renewal of the industrial part of Melrose Park. This would include the development of 5000 new apartments, new affordable housing, public parks and community facilities. An electric shuttle bus service to Meadowbank railway station and West Ryde railway station was proposed. Sustainability proposals include renewable energy generation for new homes, electric charge points for cars, as well as electric shuttle bus services & improved cycleways. The redevelopment is expected to cost $5 billion. ==References== ==External links== * [CC-By-SA] Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:City of Ryde ",
