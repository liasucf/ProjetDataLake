    "text": "Bartley Green is a residential suburban area and electoral ward to the south west of Birmingham city centre, England. The ward is part of the Birmingham Edgbaston constituency and is represented in parliament by Labour Co-operative MP Preet Gill. Located to the east is the Weoley ward, to the south is Frankley and to the west is the county of Worcestershire. To the north is Quinton and Woodgate Valley Country Park. == History == Bartley Green was first noted in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Berchelai. This means either the birch tree wood or the clearing in the birch trees (from the Old English \"beorc leah\"). Bartley Green was in the possession of the manor of Weoley. Bartley Green was again mentioned in 1657, however, this time it was under its current name. Most of the land occupied by Bartley Reservoir was in the parish of Northfield, Birmingham, originally in Worcestershire. It was transferred to Warwickshire when Northfield became part of Birmingham in November 1911. Bartley Green became more built up after the end of the Second World War in 1945, with a mix of private and council housing being built. The Athol Farm council estate was a notable development by the city council during the 1960s, and included five tower blocks; however all of these have now been demolished. However, the south-west end of the reservoir overlapped into the parish of Frankley, in Worcestershire (Hereford and Worcester, from 1974). In April 1995, part of Frankley (including the south-west part of Bartley Reservoir) was transferred to Birmingham and became part of the West Midlands county. The parish church is St. Michael and All Angels. == Politics == Bartley Green has been part of the Birmingham Edgbaston constituency since 1997, having previously been in the neighbouring Birmingham Northfield Constituency.
