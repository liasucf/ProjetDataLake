    "text": "The Balaiada was a social revolt between 1838 and 1841 in the interior of the Province of Maranh\u00e3o, Brazil. ==Background== During the imperial period, the Maranh\u00e3o region, which exported cotton, suffered a severe economic crisis because of competition with the increasingly productive United States. In addition, the cattle industry consumed a large part of the workforce in this region. These factors explain the involvement of the slave and poorly paid free workers in the movement. A political power dispute arose in the heart of the elite class, which was reflected in Maranh\u00e3o by the opposition of liberals (bem-te-vis) and conservatives (cabanos). When Pedro de Ara\u00fajo Lima, Marquis of Olinda became prime minister, provoking the so-called regresso conservador (\"conservative regression\"), the Maranh\u00e3o conservatives took advantage of the opportunity to remove the liberals in power, and at the same time, weaken them further by contracting the service of the cattle ranchers, traditionally supported by the liberals. ==Revolt== The event that began the revolt was the detention of the brother of rancher Raimundo Gomes from the ranch of his father, In\u00e1cio Mendes, a contingent of the National Guard, invaded the municipal jail and freed him, in December 1838. Afterward, Gomes, with the support of Cosme Bento, an ex-slave with a force of 3,000 escaped Africans, and Manuel Francisco dos Anjos Ferreira, called the balaio (\"basket\") because he was a basketmaker, spread the revolt across the interior of Maranh\u00e3o, conquering the province's second city in importance, Caxias, and going on to Piau\u00ed. ==Repression== Despite liberals' attempts to control it, the movement acted on its own and got out of control. In the face of a growing mass of people, local elites sought ways to stop the revolt. The imperial government sent troops under the command of Colonel Lu\u00eds Alves de Lima e Silva and made him the president of the province. By combining political pacification and a military offensive and by offering amnesty to the rebels who aided in the repression, a series of victories led to the successful pacification of the province in 1841. The leaders of the movement were killed in battle or captured. Many of the captured like Cosme Bento were sentenced and executed by hanging. ==Legacy== For his work in the Province of Maranh\u00e3o, Lima e Silva received the title of Baron de Caxias. ==References== * Claudete Maria Miranda Dias.
