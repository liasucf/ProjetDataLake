    "text": "John \"Sh\u00f4n\" Eirwyn Ffowcs Williams, (born 25 May 1935) is Emeritus Rank Professor of Engineering at the University of Cambridge and a former Master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge (1996\u20132002). He may be best known for his contributions to Aeroacoustics, in particular for his work on Concorde. Together with one of his students, David Hawkings, he introduced the far-field integration method in computational aeroacoustics based on Lighthill's acoustic analogy, known as the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings analogy. ==Education and early life== Born in Wales in 1935, Ffowcs-Williams was educated at the Great Ayton Friends' School and Derby Technical College (now part of the University of Derby). He served an engineering apprenticeship with Rolls-Royce before going to the University of Southampton, he always maintained a strong commitment to bring academic research to bear on industrial problems. He was awarded Bachelor of Science degree and a PhD from the University of Southampton in 1961. ==Career and research== He cofounded Topexpress Ltd, a consultancy company in Cambridge specialising in engineering science, was executive consultant to Rolls Royce and a director of VSEL plc. For 25 years he led the division in which The University Cambridge's Fluid Mechanics, Aeronautics, Thermodynamics, and Turbomachinery work is concentrated. He was admitted to his Professorial Fellowship at Emmanuel in 1973; he was the longest-serving professor in the University when he retired from his chair in 2002. He taught engineering for the College but, before becoming Master his main College contribution was serving on the Governing Body and its committees. He was the first holder of the Rank Chair of engineering established in 1972 in the field of Acoustics, coming to Cambridge from Imperial College London, where he held the Rolls-Royce Chair in theoretical Acoustics. His speciality was noise and vibration caused by unsteady flow. His main achievement was to persuade very good research students to tackle important but interesting problems which ranged from the aeroacoustics of supersonic flight, to the quietening of underwater platforms. His work helped make anti-sound useful for noise control and for stabilising unstable aeromechanical systems. His doctoral students include David Crighton, Steve Furber, and Ann Dowling. ===Awards and honours=== Ffowcs-Williams was award an Honorary Doctor of Science (DSc) from the University of Southampton and Master of Arts and Doctor of Science (ScD) degrees from the University of Cambridge. * He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (FREng) in 1988 * In 1984 he was awarded the Rayleigh Medal by the UK Institute of Acoustics. * In 1989 he was awarded the M\u00e9daille \u00c9trang\u00e8re by the French Acoustic Society (SFA). * For his contributions to the foundations and applications of Aeroacoustics, which have enabled dramatic reductions in the noise of aircraft and submarines he was awarded the Sir Frank Whittle Medal by the Royal Academy of Engineering in 2002. * He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society (FRAeS) * He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (FRSA) * He was elected a Fellow of the Institute of Physics (FinstP) ==References== Category:1935 births Category:Academics of Imperial College London Category:Living people Category:Masters of Emmanuel College, Cambridge Category:Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering Category:Fellows of the Institute of Physics Category:Fellows of the Royal Aeronautical Society Category:Welsh engineers Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:20th-century British engineers Category:21st-century British engineers Category:Fluid dynamicists ",
