    "text": "Leyton Athletic Football Club is a football club based in Walthamstow, London. ==History== Following the departure of Waltham Forest from the Wadham Lodge ground in 2008, the club was founded by former Waltham Forest assistant manager Martin Fitch. They started playing at the ground in place of the former tenants and joined the Essex Business Houses Football League. They finished third in their first season and then moved up to the Essex Olympian League, winning Division Three and then Division Two in consecutive seasons. In Division One, they finished 4th in 2011\u201312 and a second-place finish in 2012\u201313 saw them promoted again. After finishing 4th in the Premier Division in 2014\u201315, an application to join the Essex Senior League for 2015\u201316 was successful. In 2018 the club was renamed Leyton Athletic. In August 2018, under manager Jason Ngandu, the club secured their first-ever victory in the FA Cup; Ngandu was the competition's youngest manager at the age of 25. A 3\u20130 win against Barkingside in the extra preliminary round secured their progress into the next round where they were knocked out by Great Wakering Rovers. The club were relegated at the end of the 2018\u201319 season after finishing bottom of the Essex Senior League. On 4 September 2019, it was announced the club was withdrawing from the league after failing to secure a suitable home ground for the 2019\u201320 season. ==Honours== *Essex Olympian League **Division Two champions 2010\u201311 **Division Three champions 2009\u201310 ==Records== *Highest league position: 6th in Essex Senior League, 2015\u201316 *Best FA Cup performance: Preliminary round, 2018\u201319 *Best FA Vase performance: Second round, 2016\u201317 *Record attendance: 248 vs Clapton, Essex Senior League, 7 April 2018 ==References== ==External links== * Category:Football clubs in England Category:Football clubs in London Category:Sport in the London Borough of Waltham Forest Category:Association football clubs established in 2008 Category:Essex Business Houses Football League Category:Essex Senior Football League Category:Eastern Counties Football League Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 2019 Category:Sport in Leyton ",
