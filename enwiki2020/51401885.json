    "text": "You Were Never Really Here (released as A Beautiful Day in France and Germany) is a 2017 psychological thriller film written and directed by Lynne Ramsay. Based on the 2013 novella of the same name by Jonathan Ames, it stars Joaquin Phoenix, Ekaterina Samsonov, Alex Manette, John Doman, and Judith Roberts. In the film, a traumatized mercenary named Joe (Phoenix) is hired by a politician to find and rescue his daughter who has been kidnapped by a human trafficking network, which Joe is instructed to destroy by any violent means. An unfinished version of the film premiered at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival in competition, where Ramsay won the Best Screenplay award and Phoenix won the award for Best Actor. The film was released by Studio Canal in the UK, on 9 March 2018, and by Amazon Studios in the U.S., where it began a limited release in Los Angeles and New York on 6 April 2018, and a wide release on 20 April. It received critical acclaim. == Plot == Joe is a traumatized hired gun who rescues trafficked girls, using brutal methods against their captors. He cares for his elderly mother in his childhood home in New York City. Joe has flashbacks of the abuse he and his mother faced from his violent father, and his brutal past in the military and FBI, and is troubled by suicidal thoughts. As he comes home one night, Joe is seen by Moises, the son of Angel who acts as middleman between Joe and his handler John McCleary. Joe tells McCleary that Angel knows his address and may pose a security risk. McCleary assigns Joe a new job: a New York State Senator, Albert Votto, has offered a large sum of money to discreetly rescue his abducted daughter, Nina. He gives Joe the address of a brothel for wealthy patrons sent via an anonymous text. Joe stakes out the brothel, kills several security guards and patrons, and rescues Nina. While Joe and Nina await Votto's arrival in a hotel room, the news reports that Votto has committed suicide. Police officers gain access to the room with the help of the desk clerk, before killing the clerk and taking Nina. One of the officers attempts to kill Joe, but is instead killed by Joe who then escapes. Joe finds that government agents have killed McCleary, Angel and Moises, in search of Joe's address. Arriving back at his own home, Joe discovers that two agents have murdered his mother and have been waiting for him. He kills one agent and mortally wounds the other, who reveals that Governor Williams is directing the authorities to cover up the trafficking, and that Nina is Williams's favorite. Joe gives his mother a water burial. He fills his own pockets with stones and allows himself to sink into water with the intent of killing himself, but as he sinks, he has a vision of Nina; he removes the stones from his pockets and swims back to the surface. Joe follows Williams to his country home and fights his way in, only to discover Williams with his throat slit. He searches the house and discovers Nina seated at a dining room table, alongside a bloody straight razor. Although Joe is upset to see that Nina had killed Williams, Nina reassures him that she is alright. Later, while seated at a diner, Joe has a violent suicidal fantasy and passes out. Nina wakes him, saying, \"It's a beautiful day.\" He agrees, and they leave together. ==Cast== * Joaquin Phoenix as Joe * Dante Pereira-Olson as Young Joe * Ekaterina Samsonov as Nina Votto * Alex Manette as Senator Albert Votto * John Doman as John McCleary * Judith Roberts as Joe's Mother * Alessandro Nivola as Governor Williams * Frank Pando as Angel * Vinicius Damasceno as Moises ==Production== On 11 May 2016, it was reported that Lynne Ramsay would write and direct an adaptation of Jonathan Ames' novella You Were Never Really Here, starring Joaquin Phoenix.

The website's critical consensus reads, \"Bracingly elevated by a typically committed lead performance from Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here confirms writer-director Lynne Ramsay as one of modern cinema's most unique\u2014and uncompromising\u2014voices.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 84 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Sheila O'Malley of RogerEbert.com gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, saying that the film \"is a taut and almost unbearably intense 90-minutes, without an ounce of fat on it. Ramsay doesn't give you a second to breathe.\" Guy Lodge for Variety said Ramsay may be the world's \"greatest working filmmaker,\" and called the film \"astonishing... a stark, sinewy, slashed-to-the-bone hitman thriller far more concerned with the man than the hit.\" Some have noted similarities with You Were Never Really Here and the 1976 film Taxi Driver with both films involving friendships between an adult male and a child victim of prostitution and exploring the seedy underworld of New York City. ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Award ! scope=\"col\" | Date of ceremony ! scope=\"col\" | Category ! scope=\"col\" | Recipients ! scope=\"col\" | Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"|British Academy Film Awards | 10 February 2019 | Outstanding British Film | Lynne Ramsay, Rosa Attab, Pascal Caucheteux, and James Wilson | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"8\"| British Independent Film Awards | rowspan=\"8\"| 2 December 2018 | Best British Independent Film | Lynne Ramsay, Pascal Caucheteux, Rosa Attab, James Wilson and Rebecca O\u2019Brien | | rowspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:center;| |- | Best Director | Lynne Ramsay | |- | Best Actor | Joaquin Phoenix | |- | Best Screenplay | Lynne Ramsay | |- | Best Cinematography | Thomas Townend | |- | Best Editing | Joe Bini | |- | Best Music | Jonny Greenwood | |- | Best Sound | You Were Never Really Here | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\"| Cannes Film Festival | rowspan=\"3\"| 28 May 2017 | Palme d'Or | You Were Never Really Here | | rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;| |- | Best Actor | Joaquin Phoenix | |- | Best Screenplay | Lynne Ramsay | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4| Independent Spirit Awards | rowspan=4| 23 February 2019 | Best Feature | Rosa Attab, Pascal Caucheteux, Rebecca O\u2019Brien, Lynne Ramsay and James Wilson | | rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:center;| |- | Best Director | Lynne Ramsay | |- | Best Male Lead | Joaquin Phoenix | |- | Best Editing | Joe Bini | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Noir Film Festival | rowspan=\"2\"| 9 December 2017 | Special Jury Award | Lynne Ramsay | | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;| |- | Black Lion | You Were Never Really Here | |} ==References== ==External links== * * * * You Were Never Really Here at the BFI Category:2017 films Category:British films Category:French films Category:2017 thriller drama films Category:British mystery films Category:French mystery films Category:British thriller drama films Category:French thriller drama films Category:English-language films Category:American films Category:Film4 Productions films Category:Amazon Studios films Category:Films directed by Lynne Ramsay Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Films shot in New Jersey Category:Films about child prostitution Category:British vigilante films Category:Films scored by Jonny Greenwood Category:Films about prostitution in the United States Category:2017 drama films ",
