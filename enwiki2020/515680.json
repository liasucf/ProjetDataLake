    "text": "Good Morning, Miami is an American sitcom created by David Kohan and Max Mutchnick. The series ran on NBC from September 26, 2002 to December 18, 2003, and centered around the personal and professional life of Jake (Mark Feuerstein), the executive producer of an incredibly low-rated morning show in Miami. The series was one of the first on NBC to be fully originated in high definition. The series was launched as a part of the network's highly-rated \"Must See TV\" lineup, where it struggled in the ratings when compared to other sitcoms in the lineup, such as Kohan and Mutchnick's own Will & Grace. Midway through the second season, NBC pulled the series after Kohan and Mutchnick sued the network. The series never returned, and the final nine episodes were ultimately left unaired. These episodes were later shown on TG4 in Ireland and Channel 4 in the United Kingdom. ==Synopsis== Wunderkind producer Jake Silver decides to accept the job leading the lowest-rated morning show in Miami. He falls in love with the show's beautiful, down-to-earth hairdresser, Dylan. The carnival of clowns at the station includes pompous and insulting on-air host Gavin; Jake's sardonic assistant, Penny; and highly insecure station manager, Frank. Early in the first season, Gavin's morning co-host was Lucia, and Sister Brenda was the station's nun/weather-girl. Eventually, Jake's foul- mouthed grandmother, Claire, becomes the on-screen co-host. Both Lucia and Sister Brenda were written out early in the series as the producers were still searching for the \"center\" of their program. During the second season, Jake and Dylan begin a relationship, almost even deciding on a relocation to New York together. Victoria Hill, a new station boss, took over the show to get higher ratings, and Gavin struggled to warm up to her. A new weather girl, Joni, was also introduced. The series ended with Gavin and Penny deciding to start a relationship (as Penny is pregnant with his baby), Frank marrying Gavin's mother as a publicity stunt, and Jake and Dylan agreeing to go their separate ways (Jake leaves the station and goes to produce at NBC in Manhattan, while Dylan returns to her home state of Omaha, Nebraska). ==Cast and characters== ===Main=== * Mark Feuerstein - Jake Silver * Ashley Williams as Dylan Messinger * Matt Letscher - Gavin Stone * Constance Zimmer - Penelope \"Penny\" Barnes Barrington * Jere Burns as Frank Jennifer Alfano * Tessie Santiago as Lucia Rojas-Klein, Gavin's morning co-host (episodes 1-11) * Brooke Dillman as Sister Brenda Trogman, a nun who is also the station's weather girl (episodes 1-11) * Suzanne Pleshette as Claire Arnold, Jake's grandmother (season 1) ===Recurring=== * Stephon Fuller as Robby * Tiffani Thiessen as Victoria Hill, a new station boss in season two * Jillian Barberie as Joni, the station's new weather girl in season two * Bob Clendenin as Carl, a station camera man * Tracy Vilar as Stacey * Edward James Gage as Tiny, the station helicopter pilot ==Production== The sitcom was filmed at CBS Studio Center's Stage 16 The theme song, entitled \"Once in a Lifetime\", is played by John Rzeznik of the Goo Goo Dolls.
