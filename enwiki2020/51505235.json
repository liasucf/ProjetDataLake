When the National Agricultural Labourers' Union (NALU) was founded in 1872, he was immediately enthusiastic, joining up and becoming the delegate for his district.Nigel Scotland, Methodism and the Revolt of the Field, p.188 This brought him to national attention, and he travelled the country giving speeches in support of the union.\"Memorial notices: Mr G. M. Ball\", Manchester Guardian, 9 June 1903 In 1875, he moved to Witham in Essex to organise the union's important North Essex district. He was also elected as the union's vice-president, and served on the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress. By 1877, NALU was in decline, and focusing more of its resources on political campaigns. Ball proposed that a Land Law Reform League be formed, and this was agreed, several prominent politicians taking leading roles in it.David Tribe, President Charles Bradlaugh, M.P., p.188 Ball took employment with the Liberal Party, devoting himself to its cause for many years, from 1883 as the agent of the associated Allotment and Small Holdings Association. At the 1892 United Kingdom general election, he was its candidate for Rye, focusing his campaign on encouraging agricultural labourers to vote. He was not elected.Southern History, vol.15, p.195 ==References== Category:1832 births Category:1903 deaths Category:Trade unionists from Lincolnshire Category:Liberal-Labour (UK) politicians Category:Liberal Party (UK) parliamentary candidates Category:Members of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress Category:People from the Borough of North Lincolnshire ",
