In 1830\u20132 he was engaged with some eminent lawyers and civilians in framing rules for the guidance of the vice-admiralty courts in the colonies, the excesses of which had become notorious. In 1840 he was associated with Sir Henry Lytton Bulwer in settling, with two French commissioners, the amount of compensation to be paid to some British subjects for the forcible interruption of their trade by the French at Portendic on the coast of Africa; and in 1844, in conjunction with the judge of the court of admiralty, Admiral Joseph Denman, and James Bandinel of the Foreign Office, he prepared a code of instructions for the guidance of naval officers employed in the suppression of the slave trade. He married Frances, daughter of Dr. Cadogan of Cowbridge, Glamorganshire. Their son was Henry Cadogan Rothery (1817\u20131888), wreck commissioner. ==References== ;Attribution Category:1775 births Category:1864 deaths Category:British lawyers Category:Members of Doctors' Commons ",
