The race was the second round of the 2018 FIA Formula One World Championship and marked the 14th time that the Bahrain Grand Prix had been run as a round of the Formula One World Championship. Sebastian Vettel was the defending race winner. He entered the round with a seven-point lead over Lewis Hamilton in the World Drivers' Championship. In the World Constructors' Championship standings, Ferrari hold a ten-point lead over Mercedes. == Report == === Practice === Daniel Ricciardo was fastest in first practice with Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen fastest in second and third practice. === Qualifying === Sebastian Vettel qualified on pole position with a time of 1:27.958, a new outright track record, with teammate Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen second. Mercedes locked out the second row, although Lewis Hamilton subsequently took a five place grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change and started from ninth on the grid. Pierre Gasly made Q3 for the first time in his career, eventually qualifying in sixth. Max Verstappen started the race in fifteenth position, having been prevented from taking part in Q2 following a crash in Q1 after he lost control of his throttle as his car rode over a kerb. === Race === At the start, Vettel got away well, leading into turn 1. Bottas overtook Raikkonen to claim 2nd, and Gasly also overtook Ricciardo to claim 4th. However, Ricciardo got 4th place back at turn 4, on the first lap. Max Verstappen made up ground on the first lap so he was behind Lewis Hamilton, who'd fallen to 10th place. The pair fought at turn 1 on lap 2, with Verstappen puncturing his left rear tyre. His teammate, Daniel Ricciardo, experienced an electrical shutdown at the same time, forcing him to retire. Brendon Hartley received a 10-second time penalty for causing a collision with Sergio P\u00e9rez. Verstappen then lost drive, also forcing him to retire from the Grand Prix. This was the first time in 8 years that both Red Bull Racing drivers retired from a Grand Prix, and the first time since the 2016 Russian Grand Prix that neither Red Bull drivers had scored points, and the first time since the 2010 Korean Grand Prix that neither Red Bull was classified. Hamilton overtook Fernando Alonso, Esteban Ocon and Nico H\u00fclkenberg into one corner to move up into 6th place. He then passed Kevin Magnussen and Pierre Gasly in the next few laps to move up into 4th place. During his second pit stop on lap 35, Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen struck Ferrari tyre changer Francesco Cigarini with his left rear tyre as his car left the pit box, breaking Cigarini's tibia and fibula. The incident was caused by the Ferrari pit box's light incorrectly switching to green despite the fact that the left rear tyre had never actually been changed. After analysis, the faulty green was determined to have been caused by the pit system checking (only) if the wheel was securely fitted, and if the wheel gun had been \"sufficiently active\" beforehand. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen immediately stopped in the pit lane on advice over team radio and retired the car. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen's retirement promoted Lewis Hamilton to the podium, and Ferrari was subsequently fined \u20ac50,000 for an unsafe pit release. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen's pit lane incident meant that teammate Sebastian Vettel could not carry out his second pit stop on schedule, and had to extend the stint on his soft tyres for 30% longer than the expected lifespan of the tyres, as stated by Pirelli. Towards the end of the race, with Vettel struggling with his tyres, Bottas got within DRS range of Vettel, but could not pass for the lead of the race. Pierre Gasly finished the race in P4, equalling Toro Rosso's best result in 2017, scoring Honda's best result since returning to F1 and earning him his first points in F1. After the race, Brendon Hartley and Sergio P\u00e9rez both received 30 second time penalties for failing to maintain position on the formation lap. ==Classification== ===Qualifying=== {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:85%\" !rowspan=2| !rowspan=2| !rowspan=2|Driver !rowspan=2|Constructor !style=\"background:#eaecf0; text-align:center;\" colspan=\"3\"| !rowspan=2| |- !Q1 !Q2 !Q3 |- !1 |align=\"center\"|5 | Sebastian Vettel |Ferrari |1:29.060 |1:28.341 |1:27.958 |align=\"center\"|1 |- !2 |align=\"center\"|7 | Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen |Ferrari |1:28.951 |1:28.515 |1:28.101 |align=\"center\"|2 |- !3 |align=\"center\"|77 | Valtteri Bottas |Mercedes |1:29.275 |1:28.794 |1:28.124 |align=\"center\"|3 |- !4 |align=\"center\"|44 | Lewis Hamilton |Mercedes |1:29.396 |1:28.458 |1:28.220 |align=\"center\"|9 |- !5 |align=\"center\"|3 | Daniel Ricciardo | |1:29.552 |1:28.962 |1:28.398 |align=\"center\"|4 |- !6 |align=\"center\"|10 | Pierre Gasly | |1:30.121 |1:29.836 |1:29.329 |align=\"center\"|5 |- !7 |align=\"center\"|20 | Kevin Magnussen |Haas-Ferrari |1:29.594 |1:29.623 |1:29.358 |align=\"center\"|6 |- !8 |align=\"center\"|27 | Nico H\u00fclkenberg |Renault |1:30.260 |1:29.187 |1:29.570 |align=\"center\"|7 |- !9 |align=\"center\"|31 | Esteban Ocon |Force India-Mercedes |1:30.338 |1:30.009 |1:29.874 |align=\"center\"|8 |- !10 |align=\"center\"|55 | Carlos Sainz Jr. |Renault |1:29.893 |1:29.802 |1:29.986 |align=\"center\"|10 |- !11 |align=\"center\"|28 | Brendon Hartley |Scuderia Toro Rosso-Honda |1:30.412 |1:30.105 | |align=\"center\"|11 |- !12 |align=\"center\"|11 | Sergio P\u00e9rez |Force India-Mercedes |1:30.218 |1:30.156 | |align=\"center\"|12 |- !13 |align=\"center\"|14 | Fernando Alonso |McLaren-Renault |1:30.530 |1:30.212 | |align=\"center\"|13 |- !14 |align=\"center\"|2 | |McLaren-Renault |1:30.479 |1:30.525 | |align=\"center\"|14 |- !15 |align=\"center\"|33 | Max Verstappen |Red Bull Racing-TAG Heuer |1:29.374 |No time | |align=\"center\"|15 |- !16 |align=\"center\"|8 | Romain Grosjean |Haas-Ferrari |1:30.530 | | |align=\"center\"|16 |- !17 |align=\"center\"|9 | Marcus Ericsson |Sauber-Ferrari |1:31.063 | | |align=\"center\"|17 |- !18 |align=\"center\"|35 | Sergey Sirotkin |Williams-Mercedes |1:31.414 | | |align=\"center\"|18 |- !19 |align=\"center\"|16 | Charles Leclerc |Sauber-Ferrari |1:31.420 | | |align=\"center\"|19 |- !20 |align=\"center\"|18 | Lance Stroll |Williams-Mercedes |1:31.503 | | |align=\"center\"|20 |- |style=\"background:#eaecf0; text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"|107% time: 1:35.177 |- |style=\"background:#eaecf0; text- align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"|Source: |- |} ;Notes * \u2013 Lewis Hamilton received a five-place grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change. * \u2013 Fernando Alonso and Romain Grosjean set identical lap times in Q1.
