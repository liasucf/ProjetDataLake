Recorded by the medieval chronicler Gallus Anonymus it is one of the most well known battles in Polish history. The Polish forces were led by Duke Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth, while the Imperial forces were under command of King Henry V of Germany. Boles\u0142aw was victorious. ==Prelude== After a long-term rivalry within the ruling Piast dynasty, Boles\u0142aw III in 1107 had finally expelled his elder half-brother and co-ruler Duke Zbigniew from Poland. Zbigniew fled to the Holy Roman Empire where he sought help from King Henry V. The king however did not take action, as he was stuck in an inner-Hungarian rivalry, supporting the \u00c1rp\u00e1d prince \u00c1lmos against his brother King Coloman, and had started an armed expedition to Bratislava (Pozsony). Henry tangled with Boles\u0142aw, when the Polish duke, loyal to King Coloman, took the occasion to campaign in the Bohemian lands in 1108: as soon as the Bohemian duke Svatopluk heard of the invasion, he left the Imperial army to oust the Polish troops. Left alone, King Henry was forced to abandon his Hungarian campaign. Chafing under this defeat, Henry finally associated himself with Zbigniew and requested Boles\u0142aw to reinstate his half-brother as co-ruler, as well as to pay an annual tribute to the Empire. The Polish duke categorically rejected both demands. The next year the German forces gathered at Erfurt, crossed the Polish border near Krosno on the B\u00f3br River, and on St. Bartholomew's Day approached the fortified town of G\u0142og\u00f3w (Svatopluk's troops arrived in September). At first they defeated a Polish garrison which was stationed near the town, while Boles\u0142aw rushed from his battle against the Pomeranians at Nak\u0142o. ==Siege== According to Gallus' Gesta principum Polonorum, King Henry resorted to lay siege to G\u0142og\u00f3w but granted its citizens a five-day ceasefire to ask their king for permission to surrender. He allegedly even made the townsmen give up their children as hostages as a guarantee of the ceasefire and promised to give them back alive no matter what Boles\u0142aw's answer would be. The Polish duke however had no intention to hand over the city and ordered the defense of G\u0142og\u00f3w. After the five days were up, King Henry began to barrage the town. Breaking his promise, he chained the child hostages to his siege engines, hoping that the people of G\u0142og\u00f3w would not shoot their own offspring, which would allow him to conquer the Polish settlement. However, Gallus stated that his cruelty towards children only strengthened the resolve of G\u0142og\u00f3w's defenders. Several harsh attacks by the Imperial army were repulsed, while Henry suffered significant losses by Polish guerilla fighters. After many days of unsuccessful fighting, the king was forced to abandon the siege and march south. ==Aftermath== King Henry's campaign turned out to be a complete failure, when it ended in Boles\u0142aw's final victory at the Battle of Hundsfeld (Psie Pole). Duke Svatopluk was assassinated - probably by Bohemian Vr\u0161ovci liensmen - still at the G\u0142og\u00f3w camp on September 21. His successor Vladislaus reconciled with Boles\u0142aw, whereafter Zbigniew was able to return to Poland in 1111, only to be arrested and blinded by his half-brother shortly afterwards. Boles\u0142aw's position towards the Empire was strengthened, and in the following years he was able to consolidate his rule in Pomerania and Lubusz Land. It was not until 1157, when Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in aid of the Silesian duke W\u0142adys\u0142aw II the Exile launched a successful campaign to the Polish lands. After centuries-long ambivalent relations with Germany, the successful defense and the tradition of Henry's cruelty had evolved to a key element in the memory of the Polish nation. A first memorial stone was erected by the G\u0142og\u00f3w citizens on the occasion of the 850th anniversary of the battle in 1959. On 1 September 1979 a large Socialist Realistic memorial to the G\u0142og\u00f3w children was inaugurated to commemorate not only the 870th anniversary but also the 40th memorial day of the German Invasion of Poland. The Battle of G\u0142og\u00f3w is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription \"GLOGOW 1109\". ==External links== *Battle of G\u0142og\u00f3w Category:1109 in Europe Category:12th century in Poland Category:History of Silesia Glogow Glogow Glogow Category:1100s in the Holy Roman Empire ",
