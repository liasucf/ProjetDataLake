    "text": "Julia Gjika (born 1949) is an Albanian-born poet living in the United States. She is one of the few writers publishing in the Albanian language and writes poetry as well working as a journalist. Her poems have been praised by her peers and have been included in several publications of collected works. ==Biography== Julia Na\u00e7i was born 1 July 1949 in Gjirokastra, Albania during the Enver Hoxha dictatorship, which imposed strict sanctions and censorship on literature allowing no development of literary markets until the 1970s. In spite of the ban, Gjika studied finance at Ushrarake Academy and Albanian literature at university. She served as editor of the magazine 10 Korriku (July 10) and was chief financial officer in various military units in Korca and Tirana. She was one of a group of \"military poets,\" women who served together in the Albanian military and wrote poems, which included award- winning poet Iliriana Sulkuqi. Gjika published two works in Albania, her first book Dit\u00eblindje (Birthday) in 1971 and the second Ku Gjej Poezin\u00eb (Where I Find Poetry) in 1978. She immigrated to the United States in 1996 and took advantage of the absence of censorship. She is a regular contributor to the press of the Albanian-American diaspora in such works as Dielli and Iliria as well as in the Albanian publications Shqip and Kor\u00e7a, in which she writes about the lives of immigrants in America and other places the diaspora have settled, culture, and social issues. Gjika's work is well respected by her peers in eastern Europe and has been included in published collections of poetic works. Jan M. Stuchly, a Moravian lawyer and writer, has published three collections of poems from those he considers to be \"masterpieces.\" He included Gjika's work in his 1998 collection. A recent publication by Raimonda Moisiu, Letrat shqip k\u00ebndej e p\u00ebrtej Atlantikut (Letters Slip Here and Across the Atlantic) included works by Gijika, in his attempt to preserve those voices he deems \"masters of dialogue and conversation, who communicate artistic values\". She is married to the scientist Thanas Gjika and has a daughter. == Selected works == * Ku Gjej Poezin\u00eb (Where I Find Poetry) (1978) * Muzg : (v\u00ebllim poetik) (2008) * \u00cbndrra e Kthimit (The Dream of Return) (2010) * Oxhaku fam\u00ebmadh Zogu : album historik i p\u00ebrzgjedhur me esse, ligj\u00ebrata, kujtime..., etj.
