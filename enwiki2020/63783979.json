    "text": "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka is the Bar association in Sri Lanka. The Institute was established in 1974, amalgamating the Bar Council of Sri Lanka which represented the Advocates and Law Society of Sri Lanka represented the Proctors, after the amalgamation of both branches into a group of practitioners called the Attorneys-at-law under the Justice Law No. 44 of 1973 . Membership is optional for any Attorney-at-law. Traditionally the President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka is considered the head of the unofficial bar. ==Past President== * Hector Wilfred Jayewardene, QC (1975 - 1977) * Eardley Perera, PC (1977 - 1979) * A.
