    "text": "Miniopterus pallidus, the pale bent-wing bat, is a species of bat found in Middle-East. Until 2010, it was considered as a sub-species of M. schreibersii.Furman, A., Postawa, T., \u00d6ztun\u00e7, T., & \u00c7oraman, E. 2010 ==Range and habitat== Distribution of Miniopterus schreibersii species complex The species was clearly identified in Turkey,Bilgin et al. 2012 but Miniopterus schreibersii pallidus was also recorded in others countries in the Middle East, Caucasus, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. So far, the species was only recorded in caves,Postawa, T., & Furman, A. 2014 but it is possible that different type of underground roosts are used by this species during the year, as for Miniopterus schreibersii. ==Conservation== This species is listed in the Berne Convention and is specifically targeted by the UNEP-EUROBATS convention. ==References== ==Literature cited== * Bilgin, R., G\u00fcr\u00fcn, K., Maraci, \u00d6., Furman, A., Hulva, P., \u00c7oraman, E., Radekk, L., Bartonick, T., & Hor\u00e1\u010dek, I. 2012.
