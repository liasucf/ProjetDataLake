    "text": "Daisies of the Galaxy is the third studio album by American band Eels. It was released on February 28, 2000 in the United Kingdom and March 14 in the United States by record label DreamWorks. == Production == When the band's label requested that a clean version of \"It's a Motherfucker\" be recorded, the song was re-written as \"It's a Monster Trucker\", with modified lyrics and sound clips of lead singer E speaking \"trucker lingo\" on a CB radio. == Release == \"Mr. E's Beautiful Blues\" peaked at No. 11 in the UK Singles Chart. == Reception == Daisies of the Galaxy received a generally favorable response from critics. Fred Kovey of PopMatters called it \"a fine pop record in an era that seems uninterested in pop unless it\u2019s marketed with dance steps and a quicky bio. Though not the equal of the best work of Stephen Merritt or Elliot Smith , Daisies of the Galaxy is worthy of attention by alterna-pop fans and anyone else desperate for catchy music for grown-ups.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote: \"Unlike its predecessor, the album doesn't play like [E's] private diary; instead, it feels as if one is rummaging through his sketchbook. And, like many sketchbooks, some moments have blossomed, and others remain just intriguing, unformed ideas. For the dedicated, it's worth sifting through the album to find the keepers, since there are enough moments of quirky genius. But not all longtime fans will find this rewarding, since [E] has spent more time in creating mood than crafting songs. There are very few melodies that resonate like his best work, and the stripped-down, yet eccentric production \u2013 sounding much like a cross between Jon Brion and Beck \u2013 never feels realized.\" In a retrospective review for Stylus Magazine, Ben Woolhead described Daisies of the Galaxy as \"a very special collection of songs indeed\". == Track listing == Japanese bonus track == Personnel == ; Eels * Butch \u2013 drums, backing vocals * E \u2013 vocals, guitar, electric bass, Wurlitzer organ, production, sleeve art direction, mixing ; Additional musicians * David Alvarez \u2013 drums * Peter Buck \u2013 guitar * Wayne Bergeron \u2013 horn * Chris Bleth \u2013 horn * Andy Martin \u2013 horn * Grant-Lee Phillips \u2013 guitar * Paul Edge - turntables ; Technical * Wally Gagel \u2013 engineering, mixing * Jim Lang \u2013 engineering, horn and string arrangements, mixing * Bob Ludwig \u2013 mastering * Mickey Petralia \u2013 programming, engineering * Francesca Restrepo \u2013 sleeve design and art direction * Jeffrey Shannon \u2013 engineering * Michael Simpson \u2013 production, engineering, mixing * James Stone \u2013 engineering * Adrian Tomine \u2013 sleeve illustrations == Notes == ==Certifications== == References == == External links == * Category:2000 albums Category:DreamWorks Records albums Category:Eels (band) albums Category:Albums produced by Mark Oliver Everett ",
