    "text": "The Nike Apache, also known as Argo B-13, was a two-stage sounding rocket developed by Aerolab, later Atlantic Research, for use by the United States Air Force and NASA. It became the standard NASA sounding rocket and was launched over 600 times between 1961 and 1978. ==Development== The TE-307-2 Apache rocket motor was developed by Thiokol as an improvement of its Cajun series of rockets; the Apache was similar in appearance to Cajun, but had an improved propellant that allowed for better performance. Combined with a M5 Nike rocket booster for its first stage by Aerolab,Parsch 2004 the Nike-Apache sounding rocket was capable of lifting of instruments to an apogee of .Corliss 1971, p.82. ==Operational history== The first launch of Nike-Apache was conducted by the United States Air Force on 17 February 1961. Popular due to its low cost (US$6,000)Space Science Board 1966, p. 376. and ability to be fired from many locales, 636 launches were conducted between 1961 and 1978, with the final launch of a Nike-Apache taking place in September 1978. The Nike Apache was used to carry a variety of payloads to study a wide range of topics including radio astronomy, meteorology, aeronomy, atmospheric conditions, plasma physics, and solar physics. NASA flew them from Brazil, Canada, India, Norway, Pakistan, Spain, Suriname, Sweden, all across the US, and off of the converted escort carrier .Howard 1965, p.159. Nike Apache was the first rocket launched by India from the TERLS (Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station) of Kerala in November 1963.Pandey 2010, p.22. The Nike- Apache configuration was also used by one variation of the U.S. Army's MQR-13 BMTS target rocket.Parsch 2002 ==References== ;Citations ;Bibliography * * * * * * ==External links== * Nike-Apache rocket performance handbook at NASA Technical Reports Server * Nike Apache at Encyclopedia Astronautica Category:NASA space launch vehicles Category:Nike (rocket family) Category:Equipment of the United States Air Force ",
