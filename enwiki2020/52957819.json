    "text": "NGC 4861, also known as Arp 266, is a galaxy in the constellation Canes Venatici. It was discovered by William Herschel on May 1, 1785. Morphological classification of NGC 4861 has proved relatively difficult. Its mass, size, and rotational velocity are consistent with it being a spiral galaxy. However, due to its highly irregular shape, it may also be classified as a dwarf irregular galaxy. In fact, since dwarf galaxies are less massive and have lower gravitational potentials, gases and other material for star formation can move within them much faster, causing the galaxy to become a specific type of starburst galaxy, called a blue compact dwarf galaxy. ==See also== * Dwarf irregular galaxy ==References== == External links == * Category:Irregular galaxies Category:Spiral galaxies 4861 266 8098 44536 Category:Canes Venatici ",
