    "text": "EastEnders logo The following is a list of characters that first appeared in the BBC soap opera EastEnders in 2003, by order of first appearance. == Eleanor Trueman == Eleanor \"Ellie\" Trueman (real name Amber) is the result of a one-night stand between Paul Trueman (Gary Beadle) and a woman called Amy. Amy leaves the baby on Paul's doorstep and he struggles to cope as a single parent. He names the baby Eleanor, after the mother of his stepfather, Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker). As Paul starts to cope with looking after Eleanor, Amy decides she wants her back, and Social Services collect her, leaving Paul heartbroken. ==Dominic Price== Detective Inspector Dominic Price, played by Paul Brennen, is first seen in March 2003, while his colleague, PC Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny) is undercover as a honeytrap on Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), investigating the disappearance of Lisa Fowler (Lucy Benjamin), mother of Phil's daughter Louise Mitchell (Rachel Cox). He mainly helps Kate with initial searches of the Mitchell house, constantly reminding her that \"the boss\" wants to nail Phil. He later starts to suspect that Kate is developing feelings for Phil, and reminds her that Phil could be a murderer. Kate gives Phil an ultimatum: to tell the truth about Lisa's whereabouts or she will finish with him. After Phil calls her bluff and finishes with her, Price takes Kate off the case, however, after Phil phones her and says he will tell her everything, she is congratulated by \"the boss\" \u2013 DCI Jill Marsden (Sophie Stanton) \u2013 who has wanted to convict Phil since 2001. Kate goes to the Mitchell's house wearing a wire, and hears Phil's confession that he had mentally abused Lisa into handing over Louise, leaving her in Portugal. After this, Kate takes off her wire, telling Price and Marsden that she has fallen in love with Phil. They stick around outside, hoping that Kate has changed tactic and is still on their side, but they cannot hear what is happening as the wire has broken, so Marsden calls Kate's mobile phone, which leads to Phil discovering the wire. After a heated argument, Price and Marsden storm into the house to find Phil with his hand around Kate's throat. She refuses to press charges so they cannot arrest him, and they have to leave, deflated. Price appears again in May 2003 when Kate returns to work and is asked to choose between her job and Phil. She chooses to resign, and asks Price for one last favour as a leaving present: to get George Peters (Andy Beckwith) arrested for dealing cocaine. George is a heavy employed by Jack Dalton (Hywel Bennett), who had been sent to rape Kate. Price and Marsden later appear in November 2003, when Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) and his son Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) set Phil up for armed robbery; this time they are successful in convicting him, keeping him in custody until his case collapses in 2005. In late 2004, an off-duty Price visits Kate, now running a salon, and she tells him she is bored of her career. He finds her another job in the police, based in Brighton, which causes her to leave Walford the next day. ==Dennis Rickman== Dennis Rickman, played by Nigel Harman, is introduced as the hardman successor to the character of Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), who was killed off in the series in 2002. Dennis makes his first appearance on 14 April 2003. His storylines involve his difficult past and childhood, relationship with his infamous father, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), clashes with the rival Mitchell family, and a forbidden romance with his adopted sister, Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean). He is described as the show's \"bad boy pin-up character.\" In 2005, Harman quit the show alongside co-star Dean, and makes his last appearance on 30 December 2005. ==Mickey Miller== Mickey Miller, played by Joe Swash, makes his first appearance on 15 April 2003. Introduced as a guest character, Mickey proved popular and was turned into a regular by executive producer Louise Berridge. The character is portrayed as a wheeler-dealer, involved in various money-making scams. A family is built around the character in 2004 when the other Millers move to Albert Square. It was announced on 25 February 2008 that the characters of Mickey and his stepfather Keith (David Spinx) had been axed by EastEnders' executive producer Diederick Santer. Mickey leaves on 1 July 2008. In July 2011, it was announced Swash would reprise his role for the departure storyline of his screen brother Darren (Charlie G. Hawkins). He appears for two episodes on 19 and 20 September 2011. ==Shirley Benson== Shirley Benson is played by Robyn Moore. The character was axed in 2004.Another 'EastEnders' actor axed Shirley is initially seen in Albert Square in May 2003. A divorc\u00e9e, she has three sons, now grown up; two are in the army and the other lives in New Zealand. She works at the Walford Bookies and lives with her cat, Boots, at 89a George Street. Dan Ferreira (Dalip Tahil) needs a date for an upcoming wedding, so he asks Shirley and she agrees. Dan tells Shirley that his wife, Pushpa (Madhur Jaffrey), is dead, when they have only separated, following Pushpa's infidelity. At the wedding, everyone is enjoying the day until Pushpa introduces herself to Shirley. She is mortified to discover Dan's lies, telling him that her ex-husband was a liar and she is not prepared to put up with lying again. She also tells Dan that she wants nothing more to do with him. In August that year, Shirley has problems with her new neighbour, Gavin Sharp (Steve Nicolson). He lives in the flat above hers and plays extremely loud music at all hours, meaning Shirley cannot sleep. She tries reasoning with him several times but he laughs at her, only playing his music louder, so she complains to the council. Maddened, Gavin threatens to make her life a misery as payback. Days later, Shirley's cat disappears and Shirley fears that Gavin is responsible. Whilst Dan confronts Gavin about Boots, Little Mo (Kacey Ainsworth) walks into The Queen Victoria pub, cuddling Boots. Shirley rewards her with money but later that day, Shirley finds Boots on her doorstep \u2013 dead in a plastic bin bag. Shirley turns to the Ferreiras for help, and Dan confronts Gavin again. Gavin denies killing Boots and says that he found her lying dead in the road and left her on Shirley's doorstep so she could bury her. Shirley, however, is not convinced. Gavin's taunting continues when he puts her telephone number on a card, advertising her as a prostitute, and distributes it across Walford. Later, while she is at work, Gavin breaks into her flat and tips rotten rubbish all over the floor. Shirley is distraught, and seeing her angst, Ash Ferreira (Raji James), decides to help. He plays Gavin at his own game, borrowing his brother's amplifier and speakers and playing dance music extremely loudly. He then breaks into Gavin's flat and lets a rat loose. Gavin is petrified of rats and when he discovers it, he agrees to call a truce if they remove it. The saga brings Ash and Shirley closer together and it is not long before they start a relationship. Ash wants to keep it a secret because he knows his father will be furious if he finds out. Shirley begins to get irritated with Ash's inability to tell Dan, particularly when Dan tries to woo Shirley for a second time. Ash explains that he had been a compulsive gambler, and Dan had bailed him out of serious financial difficulties after he lost his house and his wife. He owes his father everything and is unwilling to hurt him. However, when Dan tries kissing Shirley she told him that she is with his son, Ash. This revelation causes huge rows at the Ferreiras' and although Ash loves Shirley, he feels he has no choice but to finish with her to keep the peace. In February 2004, Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs) takes over the bookies where Shirley works. Shirley does not like the way Andy runs things and after she complains repeatedly about his conduct, Andy fires her. Shirley demonstrates about her unfair dismissal with a placard outside the bookies. Eventually Andy offers her a large sum of money to leave. Shirley is thrilled with the pay-off and decides to go to New Zealand to visit her son. ==Jack Dalton== Jack Dalton, played by Hywel Bennett, is a gangland boss and the leader of the criminal organisation known as \"The Firm\". He first appears in EastEnders in May 2003, although the events surrounding the apparent death of the character Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), who was supposedly murdered in February 1989 were then retconned to include him. Dalton was a fearsome and legendary kingpin of the Walford criminal underworld. In addition to this and his status as head of The Firm, Dalton was responsible for ordering Den's death 14 years earlier. In the late 1980s, Den became involved with \"Walford Investments\", aka The Firm, and was forced to become the titular manager of Strokes wine bar (formerly Henry's), which was owned by The Firm and was really a front for illegal gambling. Strokes had a rival bar in the form of The Dagmar, fronted by James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde), who went on to rape his employee Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) - the wife of Den's best friend Pete (Peter Dean). In response to this, Den used his connections with The Firm to arrange for The Dagmar to be torched. The fire drew attention to the illegal goings-on at Strokes, and thus greatly angered The Firm. Den refused to take the blame and The Firm believed that he had informed the police about them. Consequently, Dalton decided to have Den murdered, and two of their members followed him to Manchester in September 1988 when he went there to seek refuge with a friend. However, he managed to outrun them in his friend's car and handed himself into the police; Den was then held under remand in custody on an arson charge until he appeared in court the following February. In one of the series' most famous exits, Den - who just hours earlier had escaped after members of The Firm had intercepted the taxi taking him to court - was shot as he walked by the canal by a member of The Firm, who was walking with a woman and had a gun hidden in a bunch of daffodils. Three weeks later, spots of blood were found on the canal towpath and the police identified this as Den's blood, and believed that he had been murdered. However, an initial search of the canal failed to uncover his body. In April 1990, Billy (Danny Brown), a local boy was fishing in the canal when he discovered Den's distinctive signet ring, prompting another search of the canal which this time uncovered a body which was identified as Den's. In 2003, it is revealed that Den had indeed been shot - but the shot had only wounded him. Aided by his mistress Jan Hammond (Jane How), he was able to escape to Spain where he forged a new life. Den finally returns to Walford on 29 September 2003. The body which had been found, wrongly-identified and buried had actually been the body of the unseen Mr. Vinnicombe, who was said to have been Dalton's predecessor as head of the Firm during the 1980s. Dalton had been displeased with Vinnicombe's failure to murder Den, and so ordered a member of The Firm to kill him and dump his body in the canal at the location where Den had been shot - his teeth were then bricked out to prevent dental identification; this implied a power struggle for control of \"The Firm\" at the time between Dalton and Vinnicombe. He also dumped Den's distinctive ring in the canal to further increase the likelihood of the body being identified as that of Den. Upon Vinnicombe's demise, Dalton was able to gain firm control of the organisation. During his brief spell on screen, Dalton shows a Machiavellian and ruthless streak. This is first evident when he first appears onscreen at his nightclub, the \"Imperial Room\", and receives a visit from Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) \u2013 the local hardman of Albert Square, a community from East London and it's fictionalized borough: Walford. Following Phil's visit, Dalton arranges for one of his neighbours Spencer Moon (Christopher Parker) to get beaten up for using forged currency in his club though Spencer's brother Alfie (Shane Richie) takes the beating by pretending to be Spencer. Later on, Dalton discovers that his personal secretary Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny) is actually a policewoman working undercover at his nightclub. In response, he summons his bouncer George Peters (Andy Beckwith) with the task of killing Kate by raping and murdering her in the latter's house. This is nearly successful until Phil, who previously had a one-night stand with Kate, comes to her rescue by knocking out Peters. The two men later return to Dalton, who blames Peters for failure and confronts Phil over his relationship with Kate. Though he is eventually persuaded by Phil to let Kate live scot-free, Dalton tells Phil that he now owes him a favor. At somepoint, Dalton receives a visit from Phil's love rival: Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman). It soon transpires that Dennis is Dalton's most dedicated employee, having been taken under Dalton's wing since he was 16-years-old. Moreover, Dennis had recently served 18 months in prison for covering up Dalton's criminal activities without exposing his involvement. Dennis soon begins to blackmail Dalton for \u00a320,000 in compensation for serving his prison sentence for him. After giving Dennis his \u00a320,000 compensation, Dalton plans to have him killed and summons Phil to carry out the task by reminding him of the favor he owes him. When Phil goes to kill Dennis, however, he ends up changing his mind when Dennis offers to kill Dalton himself - so the two of them will be free of him. Using the gun that Dalton originally gave Phil to kill him, Dennis confronts Dalton at his nightclub and forces him to drive Phil's car into the woods - where Dalton is ordered to park the edge of a railway track. Dalton is initially unfazed with Dennis' attempt to kill him and attempts to brainwash him in teaming up against Phil, with Dalton going as far as to recount all the things they've done together. When Dennis mentions Den and his family, pointing out that his future with Den's adopted daughter Sharon (Letitia Dean) is what matters to him now, Dalton begins to badmouth Sharon and her family before admitting to have arranged for Den to be killed. However, Dalton's mood changes from composure to fear when Dennis makes a confession: that Sharon's father is actually his father as well. Confirming that Den is his father, Dennis continues to point the gun at Dalton - who desperately attempts to reason with Dennis by revealing the truth about Den Watts; that he is in fact alive. Dalton begs Dennis that this \"has to make a difference\" in the hope that he will not shoot him, but Dennis tells him that it doesn't and - before Dalton can react - proceeds to shoot him, killing Dalton. Dalton appears to be somewhat nihilistic. When Dennis tells Dalton that he wants a new life away from a life of crime, Dalton responds \"There isn't any new life! Just the old humdrum life bobbing along, making a living, getting old, waiting to die.\" nonchalantly, echoing Dot Branning's (June Brown) words when she is depressed. Dalton's death would later be avenged at the end of 2005 when Dennis is murdered by Danny Moon (Jake Maskall) on the orders of his crime boss Johnny Allen (Billy Murray), who himself had killed Dalton's representative Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs) nearly a year before; ironically, Andy died on the same night Den was ultimately killed by his wife Chrissie (Tracy Ann Oberman). Alas, Dalton's legacy ultimately ends with Phil and his younger brother Grant (Ross Kemp) seeking to avenge Dennis' murder on Sharon's behalf - which culminates in Danny getting killed by his brother Jake (Joel Beckett), while Johnny later dies of a heart attack after being imprisoned for the murders of both Andy and Dennis respectively. ==Dan Ferreira== Dan Ferreira, played by Dalip Tahil, is the head of the Ferreira family, and father to Ash (Raji James), Adi (Ameet Chana), Ronny (Ray Panthaki) and Kareena (Pooja Shah).

He is stabbed by a gang while trying to protect his friend Tariq Larousi (Nabil Elouahabi), and needs to have a kidney transplant. When none of his family are a tissue match, Tariq reveals that he is Ronny's half-brother, and he donates a kidney to him. ==Kareena Ferreira== Kareena Ferreira, played by Pooja Shah, is the daughter of Dan Ferreira (Dalip Tahil) and sister of Ash (Raji James), Adi (Ameet Chana) and Ronny (Ray Panthaki). Kareena is in a secret relationship with Tariq Larousi (Nabil Elouahabi), though it is not a sexual one. This is not discovered by the Ferreira family until after they break up. It later transpires that Tariq is Kareena's half-brother. She has a relationship with Mickey Miller (Joe Swash), but problems arise when Juley Smith (Joseph Kpobie) gives Kareena cocaine and she is seduced by him. ==Tariq Larousi== Tariq Larousi, played by Nabil Elouahabi, is a friend of Ronny Ferreira (Ray Panthaki), and is disliked by Ronny's father, Dan Ferreira (Dalip Tahil). It transpires that Tariq is in a secret relationship with Ronny's sister Kareena Ferreira (Pooja Shah), but the Ferreira family discover this after they split up. Ronny is stabbed by a gang while trying to protect Tariq, and needs to have a kidney transplant. When none of his family are a tissue match, Tariq reveals that he is Dan's son, and therefore Ronny's half-brother. Tariq then donates a kidney to him. ==Pushpa Ferreira== Pushpa Ferreira, played by Madhur Jaffrey, is the mother of Ash (Ameet Chana), Adi (Ameet Chana), Ronny (Ray Panthaki) and Kareena (Pooja Shah). She is separated from her husband Dan Ferreira| (Dalip Tahil) after she had an affair with his best friend, with whom she moved in with.

A broke Tony visits Dennis in 2003 asking for money. He persuades Dennis to ask Dalton for a loan on his behalf.

He has a relationship with local resident Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace), but she leaves him at their wedding ceremony to be with his love rival - Alfie Moon (Shane Richie). He later goes on to marry Kat's best- friend Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf). She ends up signing her house and assets over to Andy and he then dumps her afterwards, leaving Sam with nothing. Andy also orders the murder of Alfie's neighbour Paul Trueman (Gary Beadle), after Paul - who had been working for Andy \u2013 reported him to the police for his criminal activities. Andy's luck finally runs out, however, when he tries to con fellow mob boss Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) \u2013 who consequently usurps Andy from his position as the crime kingpin of Walford.

Originally a guest character, executive producer Louise Berridge opted to bring her back the following year, offering actress Jemma Walker a 6-month contract. Walker commented in 2004, \"I think she's a bit of light relief around the place [...] Sasha called herself an 'escort', but I think she was actually on the game. But she doesn't have any issues with it. You do what you have to do to survive.\" Sasha was reportedly brought in to spice up the Asian Ferreira family, who were heavily criticised in the British media. Sasha begins a relationship with Adi and moves in with him, bringing her pet snake called Lionel. Walker has commented, \"Adi's shy and hasn't had much experience with the ladies. Sasha's had enough [bastards] mess her around and now she wants someone to settle down with.\" Sasha joins the Ferreira family mini-cab firm \u2013 they name the company Toucan Cars after her toucan slippers. She eventually realises that Adi is not right for her; she has an affair with Danny Moon (Jake Maskall) and then ends the relationship.

The character was one of many to be axed by executive producer Kathleen Hutchison following a media backlash and falling ratings surrounding the soap. ==Bobby Beale== Bobby Beale is played by Eliot Carrington.

As soon as he moves in, Gavin starts causing problems for Shirley, by playing his music extremely loudly at all hours of the day and night. After a while, Shirley pleads with him to stop being so inconsiderate, but this only makes him play his music louder. Eventually, Shirley reports him to the landlord, and then to council. After Gavin is visited from a council representative, he vows to make Shirley's life a misery. Days later, Shirley's cat, Boots, goes missing, and she fears that Gavin may be responsible. After several weeks, the cat is found dead in a plastic bin bag on Shirley's doorstep. A distraught Shirley turns to her friends, the Ferreira family, for help, but Gavin claims that he found the cat dead in the road and returned it to Shirley as an act of kindness. Shirley is not convinced. Gavin continues to make Shirley's life hell by putting her telephone number on a call-girl card and posting them around Walford. He later breaks into her flat and tips rubbish all over her floor. Ash Ferreira (Raji James) decides to step in and play him at his own game. He borrows his brother's speakers and plays dance music extremely loudly, which maddens Gavin and he reports them to the landlord. Shirley and Ash are ready for this, and upon the landlord's visit, they play classical music and pretended they are involved in a book club. This satisfies the landlord and leaves Gavin looking like a fool. He threatens both Shirley and Ash, and makes regular racist comments whenever any of the Ferreiras are around. A few days later, Ash overhears an altercation between Gavin and the road sweeper Gus Smith (Mohammed George). Gavin is unhappy about the uncleanliness of the Square, particularly as it could attract rats. Sensing Gavin's fear of rats, Ash and family convince Gus to trap a rat in the Square, and with the help of Tariq Larousi (Nabil Elouahabi), he breaks into Gavin's flat and sets the rat free. The plan works and Gavin is petrified. He promises to call a truce with Shirley if they remove the rat. However, Gavin decides to perform one last malicious act as payback. He sabotages the Ferreiras clothing stock with paint.

Graham eventually makes his intentions towards Little Mo clear by trying to kiss her. She tries to flee, but Graham chases her and rapes her on the pub floor. This results in her conceiving their son Freddie.

It is during this that Graham's mother Deirdre (Patricia Brake) approached Little Mo and Freddie and reveals that Graham has two daughters, Ella and Rebecca, from his failed marriage who he never sees. When Little Mo witnesses Graham verbally abusing Deirdre, she feels sorry for her while explaining that it reminds her of how her late husband Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns) spoke to her. Once back in the courtroom, Graham lies under oath claiming that he sees his other children often, only for Little Mo's barrister to reveal it has been over three years since he last had. With this Graham gets into a rage from the dock, shouting at his mother knowing that she has informed Little Mo of this. He is eventually sentenced to eight years in prison. Little Mo gives Deirdre her address and asks her to remain in contact. Graham last appears in January 2005 when Billy goes to visit him in prison after receiving a visiting order, which he requested.

On the day of the match, Jim is geared up to fight Edwin, but when Dot appears at the community centre, Jim is distracted and Edwin takes the advantage to get first the punch in, knocking Jim flat. Dot decides to let Jim think he won afterwards.
