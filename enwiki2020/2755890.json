Under the Local Government Act 1894 the local board's district was replaced by an urban district. Uxbridge Urban District Council held its meetings in the Second Court of the Uxbridge Courthouse. In 1955 the urban district council successfully petitioned for a charter of incorporation and became a municipal borough.Vision of Britain - Uxbridge unit history The district initially consisted of the parishes of Uxbridge and Hillingdon West. In 1929 it was enlarged by gaining from Uxbridge Rural District the parishes of Cowley, Harefield, Hillingdon East and Ickenham. The parishes were abolished in 1938 in order to create an enlarged Uxbridge parish covering the same area as the district. In 1955 it was incorporated as a borough. In 1965 the borough was abolished and its former area transferred to Greater London and used to form part of the London Borough of Hillingdon. == Coat of arms == Granted in 1948, the coat of arms of the borough was: Or on a pile gules between two fountains an eagle displayed of the field.
