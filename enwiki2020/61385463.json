    "text": "\"L.G. Fuad\" is a song by American rock band Motion City Soundtrack, released in 2006 as the third and final single from the group's second studio album, Commit This to Memory (2005). == Background== \"L.G. FUAD\"\u2014which stands for \"Let's Get Fucked Up and Die\"\u2014grew out of a night on Motion City Soundtrack's 2003 UK tour with The All-American Rejects, in which the latter band's merchandise manager was severely inebriated. He stood on the merchandise stand and shouted what became the song's refrain. All involved found great humor in the \"mantra\", which went on to be printed on business cards as a joke. The song takes from the Promise Ring's song \"Forget Me\" and its lyrical mention of forget-me-nots and marigolds. The song was recorded at Seedy Underbelly Studios, a suburban home converted into a studio in the city's Valley Village region. The song's title, and the non-capitalization of \"Fuad\", is a reference to L.L.Bean: \"The band might disagree with my recollection of things, but I swear I was trying to reference the L.L.Bean catalogues my sister subscribed to that were all over the apartment we shared,\" Pierre wrote on Twitter in 2019. The song's music video was directed by Josh Thacker. It was released with the deluxe edition of Commit This to Memory, first issued on June 19, 2006, and included on the accompanying Hooray for the Madness DVD. == Personnel == Adapted from Commit This to Memory liner notes. ;Motion City Soundtrack *Justin Pierre \u2013 lead vocals, guitar *Joshua Cain \u2013 guitar, vocals *Jesse Johnson \u2013 Moog, keyboard *Matt Taylor \u2013 bass guitar, percussion, piano, vocals *Tony Thaxton \u2013 drums, vocals Production * Mark Hoppus \u2013 production * Tom Lord-Alge \u2013 mixing * Ryan Hewitt \u2013 engineer, co-production * Eric Olsen \u2013 engineer * Jacques Wait \u2013 engineer * Chris Testa \u2013 assistant engineer * Femio Hernandez \u2013 assistant mixing ==References== ==External links== * Category:2006 singles Category:2005 songs Category:Motion City Soundtrack songs Category:Epitaph Records singles ",
