    "text": "Kristina Kockar (; born May 26, 1989), professionally known as Kija, is a Serbian singer and former flight attendant, who rose to prominence by winning the first season of Serbian reality TV show Zadruga aired on RTV Pink. ==Life and career== Kristina Kockar was born on May 26, 1989 in Zrenjanin, SR Serbia. She graduated from the Zrenjanin Grammar School, after which she finished Hotelier College in Belgrade, Serbia. Before becoming famous, she worked as an air hostess in Airpink, Air Serbia and Etihad Airways. In November 2017, Kockar entered the reality series Zadruga as an anonymous personality after her husband, Serbian singer Sloba Radanovi\u0107, had cheated on her with another contestant, Luna \u0110ogani. She immediately attracted sympathies and support from the audience and eventually won the show with 55% of the public vote in June the following year. After the show, she decided to pursue a career in music with her debut single \"Ne vra\u0107am se na staro\", released on July 20, 2018. The official music video for the song has collected close to thirty million views on YouTube. Additionally, in October 2019, Kija published her autobiography, titled Moj potpis (My Signature), in which she reflected on her relationship with Radanovi\u0107 and her time in Zadruga. Although becoming one of the biggest attractions at the Belgrade Book Fair, the book received polarizing reception in the public. Between 2018 and 2019, she also served as a judge on two talent shows broadcast on TV Pink, Pinkove Zvezde: All Talents and Pinkove Zvezdice: All Stars. In addition, Kockar was declared the gay icon in 2018 and was nominated for the Breakthrough Act at the 2019 Music Awards Ceremony. == Television appearances == *Zadruga 1 (2017/18); winner *Pinkove Zvezdice: All Stars (2018/19); judge *Pinkove Zvezde: All Talents (2019); judge == Discography == ;Singles * Ne vra\u0107am se na staro (2018) feat.
