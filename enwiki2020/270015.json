It is christened in honor of Stuttgart's former mayor, Manfred Rommel, and is the sixth busiest airport in Germany with 11,832,634 passengers having passed through its doors in 2018. The airport is an important hub for Eurowings and features flights to several European cities and leisure destinations, as well as a long-haul service to Atlanta. The airport is located approximately ( in a straight line) south of Stuttgart and lies on the boundary between the nearby town of Leinfelden-Echterdingen, Filderstadt and Stuttgart itself. In 2007, the Stuttgart Trade Fair \u2013 the ninth biggest exhibition centre in Germany \u2013 moved to grounds directly next to the airport. Additionally, the global headquarters for car parking company APCOA Parking are located here. ==History== ===First years and World War II=== The airport was built in 1939 to replace B\u00f6blingen Airport. In 1945, the United States Army took over the airport until returning it to German authorities in 1948. For the duration of the Cold War the runway and facilities were shared with the United States Army who operated helicopters, the Grumman OV-1 Mohawk and other fixed wing aircraft as Echterdingen Army Airfield on the southern portion of the airfield.http://www.mil- airfields.de/de/stuttgart-echterdingen.htm Some of the units operating at Echterdingen were headquartered at nearby Nellingen Kaserne- now closed and redeveloped.http://www.billybils.de/Seite%204_65.htm In 1984-5, the 223rd Aviation Battalion (Combat) of the 11th Aviation Group (Combat) was headquartered at Echterdingen, with three aviation companies assigned (one at Schw\u00e4bisch Hall).Isby and Kamps, Armies of NATO's Central Front, Jane's, 1985, 375. The U.S. Army still maintains a small helicopter base - Stuttgart Army Airfield - on the southern side of the airport, which it shares with the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Police helicopter wing. The police helicopter wing falls under the control of Stuttgart Police Department and has six modern helicopters based at Stuttgart and two in S\u00f6llingen. ===Later development=== The airport was expanded after World War II. The runway was extended to in 1948, then to in 1961 and finally to in 1996. Renovation was scheduled for 2020, full closure phase was preponed to be completed in April during the corona lockdown. The original 1938 terminal was finally replaced in 2004 and there are now four terminals with a maximum capacity of approximately 12 million passengers. Politicians, town planners and nearby residents have been arguing for years about the construction of a second runway. However, on 25 June 2008 Minister-President G\u00fcnther Oettinger announced that for the next 8\u201312 years no second runway will be built and that the restrictions for night operations stay in place.Flughafen bekommt keine zweite Startbahn .

After the death of former mayor Manfred Rommel in November 2013 local politicians proposed to rename the airport after him. This proposal caused public disputes as he was the son of Erwin Rommel but also highly respected for his work on intercultural affairs. In July 2014 it has been announced that the airport will be named Flughafen Stuttgart - Manfred Rommel Flughafen from now on. In September 2016, the airport unveiled new branding and corporate design, changing its official name from Flughafen Stuttgart to Stuttgart Airport.http://www.designtagebuch.de/aus-flughafen-stuttgart-wird-stuttgart- airport/ In September 2014, United Airlines cancelled their route to Stuttgart from Newark due to insufficient demand leaving Stuttgart Airport with only one remaining long-haul connection to Atlanta provided by Delta Air Lines.
