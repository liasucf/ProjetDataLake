Born in San Juan, Ferrer began piano lessons early in life with Rosa Sicard\u00f3 and Ana Otero, later working with Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Sanrom\u00e1. With Julio Carlos de Arteaga she studied composition; later, in New York, she took lessons in counterpoint with Ar\u00edstides Chavier Ar\u00e9valo and in composition with Gonzalo N\u00fa\u00f1ez Rivera. One of Puerto Rico's first women composers, in 1956 she was among he the musicians selected by the Puerto Rican government as advisors on the creation of a national conservator of music. Much of Ferrer's music remains unpublished. Her output consists largely of piano and chamber music, with some sacred and vocal pieces as well. Among her compositions are many danzas, a form which she sought to elevate out of popular culture; she also advocated for the standardization of musical notation within the genre. Her danza Ensue\u00f1o de Gloria of 1913 received a prze from the Sociedad de Escritores y Artistas de Ponce. ==References== Category:1885 births Category:1966 deaths Category:Puerto Rican pianists Category:Puerto Rican composers Category:20th- century Puerto Rican musicians Category:20th-century composers Category:20th- century pianists Category:Female composers Category:Women pianists Category:Musicians from San Juan, Puerto Rico Category:20th-century women composers ",
