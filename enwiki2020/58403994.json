    "text": "Santa Juana Formation a sedimentary rock formation near Santa Juana in the lower course of Biob\u00edo River in south-central Chile. Lithologies range from conglomerate sandstone, arkosic sandstone, siltstone and mudstone. == Description == Late Triassic (220 Ma) The sediments that consolidate into the rocks of the formation deposited in alluvial, fluvial, lacustrine and playa lake environment. Overall the formation is rich in plant fossils. The formation was deposited over the rocks of the Coastal Batholith of central Chile in a sedimentary basin that formed along the Gastre Fault. It has been posited that the basin developed as a rift during the early break-up of Gondwana in the Triassic. == See also == * Cha\u00f1ares Formation, fossiliferous formation of the Ischigualasto-Villa Uni\u00f3n Basin, Argentina * Candel\u00e1ria Formation, contemporaneous fossiliferous formation of the Paran\u00e1 Basin, Brazil * Molteno Formation, contemporaneous fossiliferous formation of Lesotho and South Africa * Pebbly Arkose Formation, contemporaneous fossiliferous formation of Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe * Denmark Hill Insect Bed, contemporaneous fossiliferous unit of Queensland, Australia * Madygen Formation, contemporaneous Lagerst\u00e4tte of Kyrgyzstan == References == Category:Geologic formations of Chile Category:Triassic System of South America Category:Late Triassic South America Category:Carnian Stage Category:Triassic Chile Category:Sandstone formations Category:Siltstone formations Category:Conglomerate formations Category:Alluvial deposits Category:Fluvial deposits Category:Lacustrine deposits Category:Paleontology in Chile Category:Geology of Biob\u00edo Region ",
