So far it's better for it. This new CBS All Access program has enough to stand on without it thanks to an array of characters who are interesting if not a little cliche.\" In a more mixed critique, Varietys offered the series qualified praise saying, \"For all its faults, the series is enthusiastically pulpy, moving with a propulsive energy that, to be frank, most streaming dramas lack. It's not nearly operating on the same prescient level as, say, The Good Fight, nor quite the radical re- imagining of fairy tales as advertised. But if nothing else, Tell Me a Story's got a wicked bite that might serve it well when trying to grab curious viewers on a streaming platform that doesn't quite have anything else like it.\" In an outright negative assessment, RogerEbert.coms Brian Tallerico criticized the series saying, \"There are talented TV veterans in Tell Me a Story, likely lured by Williamson's pedigree, but even they fail to give what could reasonably be called good performances. The pacing, the dialogue, the (complete lack of) visual language, the world building\u2014it's impossible to point to a single element that works.\" ==Home media== The first season was released on DVD in Region 1 on October 1, 2019. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2010s American anthology television series Category:2010s American drama television series Category:2018 American television series debuts Category:2020 American television series endings Category:2020s American anthology television series Category:2020s American drama television series Category:American television series based on Spanish television series Category:American thriller television series Category:Anthology web series Category:CBS All Access original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:Television shows based on fairy tales Category:Television series created by Kevin Williamson Category:Television shows set in New York City Category:Psychological thriller web series Category:Works based on Hansel and Gretel Category:Works based on Little Red Riding Hood Category:Works based on The Three Little Pigs ",
