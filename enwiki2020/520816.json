    "text": "The following is a list of major rapids and other notable features on the Colorado River through Marble Canyon and Grand Canyon below Glen Canyon Dam, in order of their position downstream of Lee's Ferry. Ratings are given for how difficult the rapid is to navigate by whitewater raft or other water craft. The Grand Canyon section of the Colorado River, like several other big- water Western rivers, uses a scale of 1-10 for rapids, 10 being the most difficult. The International Scale of River Difficulty, which classifies rapids from class I to VI, is more common elsewhere in the US and internationally. * Mile 0.0 - Lee's Ferry A large raft is launched at Lee's Ferry (Mile 0.0) * Mile 0.2 - Paria River Riffle * Mile 2.8 - Cathedral Wash (2) * Mile 4.2 - Navajo Bridges Navajo Bridges (Mile 4.2) * Mile 8.0 - Badger Creek Rapid (4-6)- First significant rapid in Marble Canyon with a large pour over in the center right. * Mile 11.4 - Soap Creek Rapid (5-6) * Mile 12.1 - Brown's Riffle (2) On July 9, 1889, the President of the Denver, Colorado Canyon and Pacific Railroad, Frank Mason Brown, drowned at this point when the boat he was in capsized.

Lake Mead was over 70 feet deep here in 2000. This rapid is formed by the Colorado River running full force into a hillside. It is a must- scout for any river runners continuing to the next take-out on Lake Mead at South Cove. It is currently considered to be unrunnable. * Mile 297 - South Cove Take-Out (in Lake Mead) ==References== == Sources == *Guide to the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, Fifth Edition, 2014, Tom Martin and Duwain Whitis, Vishnu Temple Press and RiverMaps. *\"Belknap's Waterproof Grand Canyon River Guide\"; New Edition 2009; Buzz Belnap\u2014Loie Belknap Evans; Library of Congress Control Number: 2006937059; *\"From Powell To Power; A Recounting of the First One Hundred River Runners Through the Grand Canyon. 2014, Otis \"Dock\" Marston, Vishnu Temple Press, Flagstaff, Arizona. ==External links== Category:Colorado River Category:Grand Canyon C ",
