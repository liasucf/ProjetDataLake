Most famous for his work on Easy Rider (1969) and Five Easy Pieces (1970), Kov\u00e1cs was the recipient of numerous awards, including three Lifetime Achievement Awards. He was an active member of the American Society of Cinematographers and was member of the organization's board of directors. ==Early life== Born in Cece, Hungary to Juliana and Imre Kov\u00e1cs, Kov\u00e1cs studied cinema at the Academy of Drama and Film in Budapest between 1952 and 1956. Together with Vilmos Zsigmond, a fellow student and lifelong friend, Kov\u00e1cs secretly filmed the day-to-day development of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 on black and white 35mm movie film, using an Arriflex camera borrowed from their school.Bob Fisher, \"Laszlo Kovacs, ASC... It\u2019s a Wonderful Life\" , ICG Magazine, International Cinemaographers Guils, December 1998 In November that year, they smuggled the of film into Austria to have it developed, and they arrived in the United States in March 1957 to sell the footage. By that time, however, the revolution was no longer considered newsworthy and it was not until some years later, in 1961, that it was screened on the CBS television network, in a documentary narrated by Walter Cronkite. Kov\u00e1cs decided to settle in the United States, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1963. He worked at several manual labor jobs, including making maple syrup and printing microfilm documents in an insurance office, before making several \"no-budget\" and \"low- budget\" films with Vilmos Zsigmond, including The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies.Ray Zone, New Wave King: The Cinematography of Laszlo Kovacs, ASC, ASC Holding Corp (2002), pp9-11, At the time Kov\u00e1cs would be credited as Leslie Kovacs and Zsigmond as William Zsigmond. ==Film career== Kov\u00e1cs' breakthrough came with the 1969 film Easy Rider, starring and directed by Dennis Hopper. Kov\u00e1cs was reluctant to work on this film at first, having already worked on a number of B movie biker films, such as Hells Angels on Wheels. Hopper ultimately convinced Kov\u00e1cs that this film would be different and Kov\u00e1cs signed on as the film's director of photography. He earned second place for the Best Cinematographer Golden Laurel at the 1970 Laurel Awards. In 1970, he again worked with Hopper on the film The Last Movie. That same year, Kov\u00e1cs filmed Five Easy Pieces, for which he received the third place Golden Laurel for Best Cinematographer. Kov\u00e1cs filmed more than 70 motion pictures. Among these were six films for director Peter Bogdanovich: Targets, What's Up, Doc?, Paper Moon, At Long Last Love, Nickelodeon, and Mask. Bogdanovich worked with Kov\u00e1cs more times than any other cinematographer. Other notable films Kov\u00e1cs photographed include For Pete's Sake, Shampoo, New York, New York, Ghostbusters, Ruby Cairo, Say Anything..., Radio Flyer, My Best Friend's Wedding, and Miss Congeniality. He also did additional photography on acclaimed, classic films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind and The Last Waltz. When working on The Last Waltz, camera operators were instructed to turn their cameras off on different intervals, in order to save battery life. One of these instances was during Muddy Waters' set, but Waters's outstanding performance led director Martin Scorsese to spontaneously change his mind, and ordered all cameras to be turned on. Because the cameras took several minutes to fully warm up, most caught only the last few bars of Waters' performance. Kov\u00e1cs, however, either did not hear or disregarded orders to shut down his camera, and was the only cameraperson on set who managed to film Waters' entire performance. Kov\u00e1cs' final work appears in Torn from the Flag, a 2006 feature documentary about the 1956 Hungarian Revolution which incorporates original footage he and Zsigmond shot as film students before fleeing to the United States. ==Personal life== In July 2007, Kov\u00e1cs died in his sleep at his home in Beverly Hills, California. At the time, Kov\u00e1cs had been married for 23 years to his wife, Audrey. He had two daughters, Julianna and Nadia, and a granddaughter, Mia. ==Awards and honors== In 1995 he was a member of the jury at the 19th Moscow International Film Festival. Kov\u00e1cs was honored with Lifetime Achievement Awards from Camerimage (1998), WorldFest (1999), and the American Society of Cinematographers (2002). The Lifetime Achievement Award from the ASC is the organization's highest honor. In addition, Kov\u00e1cs received an Excellence in Cinematography Award from the 1999 Hawaii International Film Festival and a Hollywood Film Award at the 2001 Hollywood Film Festival. The American Society of Cinematographers dedicated the 2008 Heritage Award for top student filmmakers in memory of Kov\u00e1cs.\"ASC Dedicates 2008 Heritage Award to Kovacs\" , The American Society of Cinematographers Magazine, September 20, 2007, retrieved 2009-02-27 The 2008 documentary film No Subtitles Necessary: Laszlo & Vilmos explores the 50-year friendship between Kov\u00e1cs and Zsigmond and their influence on filmmaking. Film critic Leonard Maltin said that, without Kov\u00e1cs and fellow cinematographer Zsigmond, \"the American New Wave of the late 1960s and early \u201870s wouldn\u2019t have flowered as it did.\"\"Documentary About Kovacs And Zsigmond To Premiere At Cannes\" , The American Society of Cinematographers Magazine, May 8, 2008, retrieved 2009-02-27 ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
