She studied at the College of Management, University of Tel Aviv, and Northwestern University. She is a partner in the law firm she founded, \"Gaby Lasky & Associates\", which specializes in freedom of speech and the right to protest. She has handled many high-profile cases, including those of conscientious objectors refusing to enlist for compulsory military service, whistleblowers, and Palestinian civilians arrested by Israeli security forces, and has argued some of their cases before Israel's Supreme Court. She represented Yonatan Polk from the anti-occupation organization Anarchists Against the Wall, the Gush Shalom faction in the legal fight against the Israeli anti-BDS law, political activists from the women's organization Machsom Watch (or Checkpoint Watch, an organization monitoring Israeli checkpoints controlling movement of Palestinian civilians), human rights organization B'Tselem, Dareen Tatour - an Arab poet prosecuted by Israel and imprisoned for publishing a poem on Facebook, as well as Ahed Tamimi - a teen- aged Palestinian activist imprisoned by Israel for slapping an armed soldier who entered her yard. Lasky is legal adviser to protest and social change organizations, including the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel and Breaking the Silence, and was formerly the chairperson of the Human Rights Legislation Committee of the Israeli Bar Association.

She is chairperson of the municipal commission for the advancement of the status of women and gender equality, and is an advisor to the mayor on sustainability and urbanism. In 2012, Lasky was awarded the Emil Greenzweig Human Rights Award by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel. In the award announcement, the reason stated included: \"\"Lasky is a central pillar for activists in Israel and the occupied territories, who works tirelessly to protect their rights, often without any compensation... In her public activity and impressive actions, Lasky sends a clear message to Israeli society: The struggle to ensure human and civil rights in Israel, and especially to guarantee the rights of the weakest and most vulnerable among us, is still underway.\" On August 6, 2019, the Israeli lawyer Gabi Lasky received a Human Rights Award in the memory of the Swedish lawyer Anna Dahlb\u00e4ck.
