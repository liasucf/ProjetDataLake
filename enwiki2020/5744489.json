    "text": "The World Skate Roller Hockey World Cup is the international championship for roller hockey organized by World Skate. The first event was held in 1936, in the city of Stuttgart. Since 1989, the World Championship tournament is held every two years on the odd years. Until 2017, it was organized by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Roller Sports. As of 2019, following the merge between the FIRS and the International Skateboarding Federation, the World Cup is now an event of the larger World Roller Games. Through the 2019 World Cup, only five countries have taken the Roller Hockey World Cup: England winning two times, Portugal winning sixteen times, Spain winning seventeen times, Italy winning four times and Argentina winning five times. Since the 2003 World Cup all events have been 16-team events, featuring a four group round- robin tournament with four teams in each group. The top two teams in each group advance to an eight team knockout final series. ==Results== ===Summaries=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;width:100%\" |- !width=5%|Year !width=15%|Host city !rowspan=\"46\" style=\"width:1%;background:#fff\"| !width=14%|Winner !width=10%|Score !width=14%|Runners-up !rowspan=\"46\" style=\"width:1%;background:#fff\"| !width=14%|Third place !width=10%|Score !width=14%|Fourth place !rowspan=\"46\" style=\"width:1%;background:#fff\"| !width=4%|Number of teams |- |1936 Details | Stuttgart |'''''' | rowspan=\"5\" |League | | | rowspan=\"28\" |League | |7 |- |1939 Details | Montreux |'''''' | | | |7 |- |1947 Details | Lisbon |'''''' | | | |7 |- |1948 Details | Montreux |'''''' | | | |9 |- |1949 Details | Lisbon |'''''' | | | |8 |- |1950 Details | Milan |'''''' |4\u20130 | | | |10 |- |1951 Details | Barcelona |'''''' |League | | | |11 |- |1952 Details | Porto |'''''' |4\u20130 | | | |10 |- |1953 Details | Geneva |'''''' | rowspan=\"20\" |League | | | |13 |- |1954 Details | Barcelona |'''''' | | | |15 |- |1955 Details | Milan |'''''' | | | |14 |- |1956 Details | Porto |'''''' | | | |11 |- |1958 Details | Porto |'''''' | | | |10 |- |1960 Details | Madrid |'''''' | | | |10 |- |1962 Details | Santiago |'''''' | | | |10 |- |1964 Details | Barcelona |'''''' | | | |10 |- |1966 Details | S\u00e3o Paulo |'''''' | | | |10 |- |1968 Details | Porto |'''''' | | | |10 |- |1970 Details | San Juan |'''''' | | | |11 |- |1972 Details | A Coru\u00f1a |'''''' | | | |12 |- |1974 Details | Lisbon |'''''' | | | |12 |- |1976 Details | Oviedo |'''''' | | | |12 |- |1978 Details | San Juan |'''''' | | | |12 |- |1980 Details | Talcahuano |'''''' | | | |16 |- |1982 Details | Barcelos |'''''' | | | |22 |- |1984 Details | Novara |'''''' | | | |10 |- |1986 Details | Sert\u00e3ozinho |'''''' | | | |10 |- |1988 Details | A Coru\u00f1a |'''''' | | | |10 |- |1989 Details | San Juan |'''''' |2\u20131 | | |11\u20132 | |12 |- |1991 Details | Porto |'''''' |7\u20130 | | |6\u20130 | |12 |- |1993 Details | Bassano d.G., Sesto S.G. |'''''' |3\u20133 (a.e.t.) 1\u20130 (p) | | |3\u20132 | |12 |- |1995 Details | Recife |'''''' |5\u20131 | | |2\u20130 | |12 |- |1997 Details | Wuppertal |'''''' |5\u20130 | | |3\u20131 | |12 |- |1999 Details | Reus |'''''' |1\u20130 | | |5\u20134 | |12 |- |2001 Details | San Juan |'''''' |2\u20132 (a.e.t.) 1\u20130 (p) | | |5\u20133 | |15 |- |2003 Details | Oliveira de Azem\u00e9is |'''''' |1\u20130 (a.e.t.) | | |3\u20131 | |16 |- |2005 Details | San Jose |'''''' |2\u20131 | | |4\u20133 | |16 |- |2007 Details | Montreux |'''''' |8\u20131 | | |2\u20132 (a.e.t.) 1\u20130 (p) | |16 |- |2009 Details | Vigo |'''''' |3\u20131 | | |8\u20133 | |16 |- |2011 Details | San Juan |'''''' |5\u20134 | | |9\u20132 | |16 |- |2013 Details | Luanda, Namibe |'''''' |4\u20133 | | |10\u20133 | |16 |- |2015 Details | La Roche-sur-Yon |'''''' |6\u20131 | | |7\u20133 | |16 |- |2017 Details | Nanjing |'''''' |3\u20133 (a.e.t.) 2\u20131 (p) | | |4\u20132 | |22 |- |2019 Details | Barcelona |'''''' |0\u20130 (a.e.t.) 2\u20131 (p) | | |5\u20130 | |27 |- |2021 Details | Buenos Aires |colspan=3|TBD |colspan=3|TBD |TBD |} ===Ranking=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !

The event was a 7 to 9-team event, featuring a two group round-robin tournament. The top four teams in each group advanced to an eight team knockout final series. This model was discontinued in favour of a B group in the \"A\" World Championship, starting with the 2017 FIRS Roller Hockey World Cup. The tournament was held every two years, on the even years. The first event was held in 1984, in the city of Paris. The first three-placed nations were granted an entry to next year's \"A\" World Championship and the last three-placed nations on the \"A\" tournament were relegated to the next year's \"B\" World Championship. ===Summaries=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center;width:100%\" |- !width=5%|Year !width=15%|Host city !rowspan=\"18\" style=\"width:1%;background:#fff\"| !width=14%|Winner !width=10%|Score !width=14%|Runners-up !rowspan=\"18\" style=\"width:1%;background:#fff\"| !width=14%|Third place !width=10%|Score !width=14%|Fourth place !rowspan=\"18\" style=\"width:1%;background:#fff\"| !width=4%|Number of teams |- |1984 Details | Paris |'''''' | rowspan=\"3\" |League | | | rowspan=\"3\" |League | |9 |- |1986 Details | Mexico City |'''''' | | | |9 |- |1988 Details | Colombia |'''''' | | | |12 |- |1990 Details | Macau |'''''' |1\u20130 | | |4\u20131 | |22 |- |1992 Details | Andorra |'''''' |5\u20133 | | |2\u20131 | |16 |- |1994 Details | Chile |'''''' |4\u20131 | | |5\u20131 | |15 |- |1996 Details | Mexico City |'''''' |4\u20131 | | |5\u20131 | |17 |- |1998 Details | Macau |'''''' |5\u20134 | | |7\u20134 | |19 |- |2000 Details | Chatham |'''''' |2\u20130 | | |8\u20133 | |15 |- |2002 Details | Montevideo |'''''' |5\u20134 | | |3\u20131 | |10 |- |2004 Details | Macau |'Despite winning the tournament, Catalonia did not contest the 2005 \"A\" World Championship due to the FIRS not endorsing its final acceptance.
