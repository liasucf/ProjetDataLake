    "text": "In the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology, D\u00e1ire mac Fiachna was an Ulster cattle-lord and owner of Donn Cuailnge, the Brown Bull of Cooley, over which the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge (Cattle Raid of Cooley) was fought. Queen Medb of Connacht had discovered that her husband, Ailill, was richer than her to the tune of one extremely fertile stud bull, and resolved to even the account by possessing D\u00e1ire's great bull. She sent messengers to D\u00e1ire with an extremely generous offer of land and treasure, and if necessary sexual favours, if he would loan the bull to her for a year. D\u00e1ire agreed. However the messengers got drunk, and one boasted that if he had not agreed Medb would have taken the bull by force. When D\u00e1ire heard that he backed out of the deal, and Medb did indeed take the bull by force. Following the medieval Irish genealogies, D\u00e1ire appears to have been a paternal relative of Conchobar mac Nessa. D\u00e1ire mac Fiachna appears in the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Regamon in a ghastly chariot alongside the Morr\u00edgan. He is described as a great man wrapped in a red cloak with a forked hazel staff at his back. The Morr\u00edgan first introduces him as h-Uar-gaeth- sceo-luachair-sceo before later revealing that he is D\u00e1ire mac Fiachna and the owner of the Donn Cuailnge. ==See also== * D\u00e1ire ==References== *Cecile O'Rahilly (ed & trans), T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faalnge from the Book of Leinster, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1967, pp. 138\u2013141 Category:Ulster Cycle Category:Characters in T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge ",
