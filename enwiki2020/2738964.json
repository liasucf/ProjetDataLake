He challenged for the world heavyweight title on an unprecedented four occasions, losing all four attempts to Wladimir Klitschko, Chris Byrd, Nikolai Valuev and Samuel Peter. Despite never winning a world title, McCline did defeat former champions and top contenders in Michael Grant, Lance Whitaker, Al Cole, and Shannon Briggs. McCline retired in 2012 at the age of 42. ==Championship titles held== * WBC Continental Americas Heavyweight Champion (2001) * WBO-NABO Heavyweight Champion (2006) ==Life before boxing== McCline grew up in Harlem, New York City, living in group homes, foster homes, and orphanages where he learned to live independently. Graduating from Comsewogue High School in Port Jefferson Station, New York, McCline spent five years in prison for gun running prior to becoming a professional fighter. Big Time Beckons ==Professional career== Starting at the late age of 25 years and having no amateur experience, McCline took straight to the pro ranks taken part in four world Heavyweight title clashes with Chris Byrd, Wladimir Klitschko, Nikolai Valuev and Samuel Peter, losing all four times. Uniquely, each of these title bouts was for a different version of the world title. He has captured several wins against notable fighters, including Alfred Cole, Michael Grant, Lance Whitaker, Shannon Briggs, Charles Shufford, Cedric Boswell, and Terry Smith but has been unable to replicate these performances in title fight situations, although the loss to Chris Byrd was by only one point in a very controversial split decision. Also losing a championship fight in which he had the champion (Sam Peter) down three times during the fight. In addition to the aforementioned title fight losses, he has lost to Greg Pickrom, Calvin Brock and was upset by the underdog Zuri Lawrence in 2005. After which, he went on a six fight win streak that led him back to a World Title fight yet another two times. On January 20, 2007 McCline challenged WBA heavyweight title holder Nikolai Valuev, in what was the first ever heavyweight title fight on Swiss soil. The fight was also reportedly the \"biggest\" championship fight in history, with the two fighters having a combined weight of approximately 600 pounds (270 kilograms) on fight night. Valuev was declared the winner by TKO when McCline suffered a patellar tendon rupture of his left knee at the end of the third round while throwing a punch and was unable to continue. At the time of the stoppage McCline was behind on only 1 of the judges scorecards. Jimmy Lennon, Jr. making the fighter introductions before the Samuel Peter fight at the Madison Square Garden in October 2007. McCline was most recently set to face Vitali Klitschko, in the latter's first fight back since retiring from the ring in 2005, but due to an injury Klitschko was forced to pull out, and instead McCline fought Samuel Peter on 6 October 2007 for Peter's WBC Interim title. Despite managing to put Peter on the canvas 3 times in the early rounds of the fight (the first knockdowns of Peter's career) McCline would go on to lose to a controversial unanimous decision on the judges scorecards. On March 8, 2008 McCline faced former two-time WBA heavyweight title holder John Ruiz in Mexico. McCline lost a unanimous decision in a 12-round scheduled bout. In McCline's most recent bout he defeated Mike Mollo by unanimous decision on November 7, 2008.
