In the same interview Fallon said only one song was finished so far, referring to Biloxi Parish which they performed on stage at Pinkpop 2011 as well as Rock Am Ring. Fallon stated that the band's next record would sound closer to their breakthrough record, The '59 Sound, rather than American Slang. During this time, Fallon was also working with good friend Ian Perkins on their side project, The Horrible Crowes. On October 6, 2011, the Gaslight Anthem announced via Facebook that they had signed with Mercury Records.

The band stated on April 14 that they had arrived at the \"last week in the studio\" of recording the album. In an interview with Rolling Stone published May 23, 2014, Fallon described the new record as \"completely different than anything we had ever done before.

It was released on August 12, 2014. On July 24, 2014, the music video for the title track debuted.

The band later via their Facebook page, announced that they were reuniting for a string of shows celebrating the 10th Anniversary of The 59' Sound. Regarding the decision, Brian Fallon noted, \"The big thing between us was let's just do what's fun. So if it's heavy-handed and not that cool, then let's not do it. But we all feel that this is an important record to not only us, but to the people that love it. I would not be on the phone talking about my Sleepwalkers record had it not been for The '59 Sound.\". Fallon stated, however, that the band would not be working on new material during the reunion: \"I think Green Day's American Idiot is probably the best comeback or mid-career record that any band has done. So if I was sitting on American Idiot level stuff, then I might push for the, 'Hey guys, maybe we should try these songs out.' But I'm not sitting on that. I don't have a Born to Run in me.\" Fallon elaborated, \"People will always say, \u2018Why are you doing a solo record?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018because I don\u2019t have anything to say with Gaslight\u2019. Those five records, that\u2019s what you got. That\u2019s the piece. I feel it\u2019s a lot like The Replacements. There\u2019s no new music because that\u2019s all Paul Westerberg and the band has to say. When the book is over, it\u2019s over. And I have like\u2026 four-and-a-half records I\u2019m really proud of.\" In June 2018, the band released The 59 Sound Sessions, a 10th anniversary album of 9 early versions and B sides from The '59 Sound. They then celebrated this milestone with a tour through North America and Europe. == Description and influences == The New York Times music critic Jon Caramanica described the band as \"part of a rich tradition of New Jersey punk, spanning the Misfits to the Bouncing Souls.\" The Gaslight Anthem's music also embraces many elements of the Jersey Shore sound. Brian Fallon's fondness for Springsteen, a significant influence on their music, is a fact celebrated by fans and critics alike. However, the band claims they never set out to sound like the New Jersey icon. Representative of such views, one critic wrote, \"The Gaslight Anthem are like something out of speculative fiction: this is what pop music would be if Springsteen hadn't listened to his producer, let The Ramones record Hungry Heart, and launched the C.B.G.B.'ers into megastardom.\"\"Review of 'Senor and the Queen.'\" Sobriquet Magazine Record Reviews, May 12, 2008 Drummer Benny Horowitz and guitarist Alex Rosamilia stated that \"We're more Bruce Springsteen appreciators. We didn't start listening to him until we joined the band. I always liked his songs when I heard them, but I wasn't a big fan until I met Brian [Fallon].\" Following the release of their third album, American Slang, Fallon himself said, \"There's so much else that we look at for our sound and influences that you don't want to be notched in with one guy... There's a lot of things [Springsteen] does that I admire. We come from a lot of the same places but a lot of different places, too. But at the same time, that's a good thing to be compared to. I think it's one of those things we're gonna have to wear until it wears out.\" Of the Springsteen comparisons, Rosamilia added, \"I think there's enough out there on the Internet about that already.\" The song \"I'da Called You Woody, Joe\" is a tribute to Joe Strummer, who has been spoken about and referenced by lead singer Brian Fallon often. Similarly, Tom Petty is referenced in several songs, either by name or through references to particular songs of his. The band has covered Petty's \"American Girl\" and \"Refugee\" live. As a bonus track for the deluxe version of Handwritten, the Gaslight Anthem covered the Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers song \"You Got Lucky\". == Band members == * Brian Fallon \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar (2006\u20132015, 2018) * Alex Rosamilia \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals (2006\u20132015, 2018) * Alex Levine \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals (2006\u20132015, 2018) * Benny Horowitz \u2013 drums, percussion (2006\u20132015, 2018) Touring member * Ian Perkins \u2013 keyboards, additional guitar, backing vocals (2010\u20132015, 2018) Former members * Mike Volpe \u2013 lead guitar (2006) == Discography == * Sink or Swim (2007) * The '59 Sound (2008) * American Slang (2010) * Handwritten (2012) * Get Hurt (2014) == See also == *Music of New Jersey *Jersey Shore sound ==References== == External links == * * SideOneDummy (record label) * Fan Site: The Gaslight Anthem Record * Gaslight Anthem at www.punknews.org * July 2010 Cover Story * Review of American Slang \u2013 the single *Gaslight Anthem Interview on TheWaster.com Category:Musicians from New Brunswick, New Jersey Category:Folk punk groups Category:Punk rock groups from New Jersey Category:Musical quartets Category:Kerrang!
