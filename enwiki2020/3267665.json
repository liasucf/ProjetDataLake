His big break came with his musical scores for the 2007 film Alvin and the Chipmunks, Hop, Think Like a Man, and Warner Bros. comedy Horrible Bosses as well as the video game series Medal of Honor created by Steven Spielberg. He composed the score for Supernatural and more recently Revolution, two television series created by Eric Kripke. He also scored Galavant and Sausage Party with Alan Menken and Marvel's Agent Carter including a first ever Marvel musical number co-written with Tony award winning lyricist David Zippel. He composed the songs for UglyDolls with Glenn Slater for Kelly Clarkson, Nick Jonas, Lizzo, Janelle Monae, and Blake Shelton. Currently he composes the score for the Netflix sci- fi series Lost in Space and the Amazon Prime Video series The Boys from Kripke, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. ==Life and career== Lennertz was born in Methuen, Massachusetts. He attended Easton Area High School in Easton, Pennsylvania and then the Thornton School of Music at the University of Southern California, where he studied with Academy Award-winner Elmer Bernstein. Lennertz has written music for a variety of comedies such as Horrible Bosses, Ride Along, as well as Identity Thief, and Think Like A Man. He has also worked on hit family films including Hop, and Alvin and the Chipmunks and critically acclaimed dramas Adam and Thanks For Sharing. He has worked with artists including Basil Poledouris, Michael Kamen, Ozomatli, Dave Grusin, Alan Menken, The RZA, Five For Fighting, and Alien Ant Farm. His collaboration with Ozomatli on their record Street Signs garnered a Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock Album. He was named best new composer in 2002 for his score to Clive Barker's Saint Sinner. He won several awards for his 2003 soundtrack to Medal of Honor: Rising Sun, the first of three Medal of Honor games composed by Lennertz.
