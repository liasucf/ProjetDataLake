    "text": "Sargans is a municipality in the Wahlkreis (constituency) of Sarganserland in the canton of St. Gallen in Switzerland. Sargans is known for its castle, which dates from before the founding of the Swiss Confederation in 1291. Sargans was also a County of the Holy Roman Empire; see County of Sargans. ==History== There are traces of Neolithic settlement in the area. A significant Roman-era estate was destroyed by an Alamannic incursion in c. 270. Sargans remained part of Lower Raetia in the early medieval period, with gradual displacement of Rumantsch by Alemannic speakers during the high medieval period. A church dedicated to Saint Cassian is mentioned in the 9th century. Sargans was part of the territory of the county of Werdenberg from the 12th century, with a separate line of Werdenberg-Sargans established in the later 13th century. The castle was presumably first built in the 12th century and is first mentioned in 1282. The town of Sargans grew around the castle in the 13th century. Sargans is mentioned as Senegaunis in the 11th century. An earlier mention as de Senegaune, ostensibly dated to 765, survives in a 16th-century copy. In 1248 it was mentioned as Sanegans, in 1264 as Sangans and in 1332 as Santgans. The modern spelling dates to the 16th century. The etymology of the name is unknown; San- seems to have changed to Sar- under the influence of the hydronym Saar. A popular etymology connecting the name Sargans to \"goose\" (German Gans) may date to as early as the 15th century.The most likely etymology is derivation from a personal name, possibly pre-Roman, perhaps *Senekanos or similar. Etymologies connecting the hydronym Saar are secondary, as the earliest records of the name are all in San-. Lexikon der Schweizerischen Gemeindenamen (2005). Matth\u00e4us Merian's Topographia Germaniae of 1654 is aware both of the derivation from Saar and of the \"goose\" popular etymology (\"Sarunegans / oder Sargans / hat vor Zeiten die Saruneter zu Innwohnern gehabt / von welchen diese Statt / und Landschaft / oder vielmehr vom Wasser Sarn / und Ganss / den Namen hat / wie Tschudi / so allhie Anno 1530 Und 33. Landvogt gewesen / darf\u00fcr helt / und nicht allein die Grafen / sondern auch die Statt in dem Schild eine Gans f\u00fchret / Guler . lib. 14. Raetia fol 211. Vadianus nennts sanam casam: Aus welchem der Missbrauch nach und nach Sarganss gemacht / und auss solchem verb\u00f6serten Namen folgends das Wappen gezogen sey.\") From 1406, a combined fortification of the town and the castle was built. In 1445, the town, but not the castle, was captured and burned by the Swiss Confederacy. The town was given limited rights of self- government in 1456 when the count agreed to select a Schultheiss out of a list of three candidates to be submitted by the burghers. In 1483, count J\u00fcrg of Werdenberg-Sargans was forced to sell the county to the Swiss Confederacy for 15,000 Rhenish guilder. From this time until 1798, the castle was the seat of the Swiss reeves. The town burned down again in 1490. In 1501, the Swiss Confederac confirmed the city rights of Sargans and granted the right for a weekly market. The municipal coat of arms goes back to the 15th century.Attested 1445 as a flag design.

It was incorporated into the Canton of St. Gallen in 1803. Most of the town was destroyed by fire in 1811. Sargans is at the juncture of the railway lines connecting Chur with Z\u00fcrich and with Lake Constance, built in 1859. The line to Vienna was added in 1884. The Saar was first canalised in 1858 for the construction of the railway station and again in 1978 for the construction of the A3-A13 motorway junction. Sargans remained mostly unaffected by industrialisation; the Gonzen iron ore mine was closed down in 1966. ==Geography== Aerial view from 200 m by Walter Mittelholzer (1919) View from Mt.
