    "text": "FC Djursland is an association football club based in the town of Grenaa, Denmark, that competes in the Denmark Series, the fourth tier of the Danish football league system. The club is a merger established in Djursland in 2009, originally between five parent clubs. Today, three clubs remain in the merger: Grenaa IF, AC Norddjurs and \u00d8stdjurs 91. FC Djursland is affiliated to DBU Jutland, and plays its home matches at Grenaa Idr\u00e6tscenter where it has been based since 2009. == History == === Foundation === FC Djursland was presented on 5 November 2009 as a cooperative superstructure between Grenaa IF, \u00d8stdjurs 91, AC Norddjurs, \u00c5strup/Hammelev IF and Kolind Pederstrup. Vice-mayor of Grenaa Municipality and an active member of Grenaa IF, Keld Overgaard Jensen, functioned as a driving force in the merger. Djursland Bank became attached to the new club as the main sponsor for the first three years of its existence. \u00c5strup/Hammelev IF, one of the parent clubs of the merger, had already been established in 1995 as a superstructure of the clubs \u00c5strup IF and Hammelev IF, and chairman of the club, S\u00f8ren Slemming, stated after the realisation of FC Djursland that a merger would not be damaging to the parent clubs, as they already had established an extensive cooperation agreement in the youth teams. FC Djursland would compete on the existing DBU licence Grenaa IF, who at that point competed in the Denmark Series, the fourth tier of Danish football. The goal of the new club was, as former chairman of FC Djursland, Benny S\u00f8rensen stated, to bring football in the Djursland area into the higher divisions. This could only be achieved by uniting a number of regional clubs in the collaboration, which, in time, could form a counterweight to the dominance of the larger clubs in Aarhus and Randers, AGF and Randers FC. === Between third and fourth tiers (2010\u20132015) === The team played their first match against AGF on 27 June at Grenaa Idr\u00e6tscenter. They would, during their debut season, reach promotion to the Danish 2nd Division, the third tier of the Danish football league system. However, they would only last one season at the third level, suffering relegation by only one point on the last day of the season after losing 2-1 at Tj\u00f8rring IF who had already been relegated. Following the relegation back to the Denmark Series, club captain Martin Andersen, who had scored five goals the season before, left the club to become player-assistant at N\u00f8rager Boldklub. Furthermore, FC Djursland lost their top goalscorer Christoffer Hansen, who signed with Blokhus FC on a two-year deal after having scored 16 goals. Heading into the new season, the goal was direct promotion back into the third tier but after struggling in the first half of the season, the club hauled in a key addition, Iddi Alkhag, who came with previous experience from the Danish Superliga and would take on the role as player- assistant. The season ended with a disappointing midtable finish; 8th place in Group 3. In the Danish Cup, FC Djursland were knocked out early on after a crushing 1-8 loss to Randers FC. Two months into the 2012\u201313 season, Emmanuel Ake, another player with multiple years of experience at the highest level, joined FC Djursland. With him as their star player, the club reached promotion to the Danish 2nd Division by finishing third in Group 3, which was achieved in the final round of regular season after drawing 2-2 against Aalborg Freja. ==Personnel== FC Djursland logo outside club facilities. ===Current technical staff=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Position!!Name |- |Chairman of the Board|| Henning Meisler |- |Vice-chairman|| Carl-Eric W\u00fcrtz Pallesen |- |Commercial Director|| Morten Torp |- |Director of football|| Nicolaj R.
