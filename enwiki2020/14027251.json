    "text": "Bullata is a genus of small to large sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Marginellidae, the margin snails. ==Distribution== This is a tropical western Atlantic genus. ==Habitat== Representatives from this genus have been recorded at depths from one to 60 metres. ==Shell description== The shells of species in this genus are moderately large to very large, range size from 14 mm (Bullata largillieri, smallest species of Bullata) to 97.9 mm (largest specimen known of Bullata bullata). (pl I) The shell color is a yellowish-orange to orange- or pinkish-brown, spirally banded (pl II) or with white spots (pl III). The lip is pink, yellow, or orange, darker than shell color (pl IV). The shell surface is smooth and glossy. The shape is elliptical to oblong or obovate, moderately to strongly shouldered (pl V bottom). The spire is immersed or near so (pl V top). The aperture is narrow to moderately broad, wider anteriorly. The lip is moderately strongly thickened, weakly to strongly denticulate in adults, with a distinct external varix. A siphonal notch is present but a posterior notch is absent. The parietal callusing is weakly to strongly developed, especially posteriorly, and is absent in type species. The columella has four continuous plications occupying less than half the aperture length. The internal whorls are unmodified. (pl VI/VII) ==Remarks== The large, patterned shells with an immersed spire and 4 moderately heavy columellar plications which are not crowded anteriorly, serve to distinguish this group of species. This genus is restricted to the Caribbean province, where it evolved in the Miocene as a direct offshoot of Prunum. Coan (1965:189) placed Cryptospyra as a subgenus of Bullata. Coovert & Coovert (1995:93) consider as distinct genus, as they have separate origins: Bullata is a direct descendant of Caribbean Prunum, whereas Cryptospira is restricted to the western Indo-Pacific where it evolved.
