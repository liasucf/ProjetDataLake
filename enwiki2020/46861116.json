It has the mission to promote an appreciation of all of the languages spoken in Canada, and of their role in the development of the country. Since its founding, the Canadian Language Museum has curated a bilingual, traveling exhibit each year. The exhibits that have been produced so far include: * Canadian English, Eh? (2012) * Speaking the Inuit Way (2013) * French in Canada (2014) * Cree': The People's Language (2015) Each exhibit is produced with the assistance of the Faculty of Information, and the University of Toronto Department of Linguistics; as well as relevant academic and community stakeholders. Its exhibits travel across Canada, from Victoria to St. Johns, touring schools, universities, community centres, libraries and other similar public institutions. The Museum has also been present at the annual meeting of the Canadian Linguistic Association each late May as part of the Congress for the Humanities and Social Sciences. The Museum also supports its mission online by operating a website, where interested parties can request exhibit loans. It also promotes language revitalization, the work of Canadian linguists, and language research more broadly through its Twitter account,https://twitter.com/CanLangMuseum and with its blog, which publishes original interviews with people from across Canada working to protect and promote the languages of Canada. The Canadian Language Museum opened its office in Toronto in the summer of 2015. ==See also== * List of museums in Toronto ==References== ==External links== * Category:Museums in Toronto Category:University of Toronto Category:University museums in Canada Category:Language museums ",
