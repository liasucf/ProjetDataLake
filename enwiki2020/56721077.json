    "text": "Marcello Costa (born 9 January 1940) is an Italian-born Australian medical researcher, academic, and public health advocate. He specializes in the structure and functions of the enteric nervous system. He taught in Turin, Melbourne, and Helsinki before moving to Adelaide in 1975 where he was a foundation lecturer at the Flinders Medical School, building the new discipline of neuroscience at the college. He has been at Flinders University since, where he is the Matthew Flinders Distinguished Professor of Neurophysiology in the Department of Physiology. He co-founded the Australian Neuroscience Society, the South Australian Neuroscience Institute (SANI) and the Friends of Science in Medicine (FSM). He was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal and the inaugural Lifetime Achievement Award by the Federation of Neurogastroenterology and Motility Societies, and in 2020 he was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia. == Early life and education == Costa was born in Turin, Italy, on 9 January 1940. In 1949 his family migrated to Argentina, where he attended San Martin high school and then in 1954 entered the public Italian High School Cristoforo Colombo of Buenos Aires, finishing the Scientific Lyceum in 1960. In his youth he was intrigued by science, even selling his bicycle so he could buy a microscope to study protozoa in ponds. He studied as an intern in the University of Turin's Department of Anatomy and Histology, working as a researcher under supervision of Giorgio Gabella. He was involved in a number of extracurricular activities including editor of the university newspaper l'Ateneo. Although he was enrolled in anatomy, he also incorporated physiology despite resistance from the university to this multidisciplinary approach. He earned his degree in medicine (Laurea in Medicina e Chirurgia, equivalent to MB BS) from the University of Turin in 1967; his M.D. thesis was \"The Adrenergic Innervation of the Alimentary Canal\" with Dignita di Stampa (worthy of publication). == Medical research career == Upon graduating in 1967, Costa completed compulsory military service as medical officer, then he began lecturing at the University of Turin. The following year, he became a Medical Registrar and general practitioner in Italy. In 1970 he and his newlywed wife Daniela migrated from Italy to Australia. Initially he worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow in zoology under Professor Geoffrey Burnstock at the University of Melbourne (1970\u20131973). In 1973 he also worked as a research fellow at the University of Helsinki in Finland, and then at the University of Turin. In 1975 he moved back to Australia, as a lecturer in Human Physiology at Flinders University. The discipline of neuroscience was new at the time, and he became a foundation lecturer in the field at the Flinders Medical School (now called the College of Medicine and Public Health). In 1986 Flinders University recognized his service by creating a personal chair in Neurophysiology, and in 2013 he was appointed the Matthew Flinders Distinguished Professor in the College of Medicine and Public Health, and Professor of Neurophysiology. His research focuses on the nervous system, specifically how it interacts with the gut to control it, and he has authored or co-authored more than 250 works on that subject, 72 review articles and chapters, and written two books. He also made what Flinders University describes as \"a range of landmark discoveries about the role of neurons in driving the activity of the gut, and in recognising that a person's neurological system shapes their thoughts, culture, intellectual capacity, emotions and our bodily functions\". Costa's application of a systematic approach to new methods has made the neuronal structure of the enteric nervous system one of the best understood parts of the nervous system in mammals. Observations in this system have also guided understanding the function of neurons in the central nervous system. The studies he conducted into neuronal reflexes that enable intestinal motility and the neurotransmitters that are involved led to the discovery of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. In 1983, Costa and John Furness organized the first meeting of the global leaders in the new field of enteric Neuroscience, which was held in Adelaide. In 2014 Costa collaborated with younger colleagues to organize a second such symposium in 2014 named \"The enteric nervous system: 30 years later\". He was a founder of the Australian Neuroscience Society, and he served as its president in 1994\u20131995. In 2003 he founded the South Australian Neuroscience Institute (SANI) in association with neuroscience colleagues and the SA Government, representing the three SA Universities; he served as its co-chair from 2003 to 2010. == Community engagement == In addition to his formal academic roles, Costa has promoted science-based medicine, philosophy of science and educating the general public, especially concerning neuroscience. He is often called on by media to give expert commentary on a number of topics, including the evidence against acupuncture, universities which give credibility to pseudo-scientific topics including chiropractic, whether the free trade agreement between Australia and China should include \"traditional Chinese medicine\", proposals to register traditional Chinese medicine, and the \"white light\" reportedly seen by some dying people. He also promotes awareness of the connections between science and humanities, especially in a project called \"Science Outside the Square\" where he teams with Ian Gibbins, Professor of Anatomy at Flinders, playing keyboard while Costa sings and plays the guitar. Their performances aim to combine science, music, and art. Costa jointly founded the \"Friends of Science in Medicine\" (FSM) in 2011, and until 2019 he served as its treasurer. The University of Adelaide described FSM as \"a public health watch dog group of distinguished lay members, scientists and health professionals who are concerned about honesty in medical claims and the need for evidence-based medicine particularly in the growing alternative therapy industry\". He presented at the 2017 World Science Festival. He is a member of the Scientific Advisory Panel of the Australian Science Media Centre. He was a solo speaker at the Adelaide Festival of Ideas in July 2018, speaking on \"A neuroscientist's view of homo sapiens and its world\". == Personal life == Costa married Daniela Tuffanelli in 1970. The couple has a son, Andrea. ==Awards and recognition== His awards and recognitions include: * 1988: Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science * 1992: \"Cavaliere della Repubblica Italiana\" from the Italian Government * 1994: Piedmontese of the Year * 1997: Honorary member of the Golden Key Honour Society * 2001: Centenary Medal Australia * 2004: Member of the Australian Academy of Brain Sciences * 2006: Flinders 40th anniversary medal for services to the university * 2008: \"Unsung Hero of South Australian Science Communication\" Award (jointly with Ian Gibbins) * 2008: Life member of the Centre of Neuroscience at Flinders University * 2010: Life membership of the ANS * 2012: Matthew Flinders Distinguished Professor at Flinders University * 2012: (jointly with the other three founding members of FSM) \u2013 \"Skeptics of the Year\" by the Australian Skeptics Inc. *2014: Australasian Neuroscience Society medallion for \"individuals who have provided outstanding service to the Society\" * 2015: Inducted as an Honorary Bragg Member of the Royal Institution of Australia (RIAus) * 2018: Federation of Neurogastroenterology and Motility (FNM) Societies Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of his research and mentorship, which have substantially influenced progress in the fields * 2020: Officer of the Order of Australia (General Division) \"for distinguished service to higher education, and to medical research, in the field of neurophysiology, and to professional scientific bodies.\" == Published books == * * * * ==References== ==External links== * from Flinders University * Friends of Science in Medicine * Australian Neuroscience Society * \"A neuroscientist's view of homo sapiens and its world\" \u2013 recording of presentation from 2018 Adelaide Festival of Ideas.
