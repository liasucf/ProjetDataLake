He was Official Referee of the Supreme Court of Judicature, and The Times noted that the number of times his judgements were reversed on appeal \"can be counted on one's fingers\".Obituary, The Times, 7 December 1920 ==Biography== Born on 29 December 1836, Henry Verey was educated at Bedford School, between 1847 and 1855, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was an Exhibitioner and graduated in Mathematics in 1859.
