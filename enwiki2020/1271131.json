Finally Galindo made his debut with the first team in the 2002 spring season, and was a solid starter by the 2003 Clausura season. Galindo was a member of the Mexico national team, and has played for numerous Mexico youth teams; a starter for the U-23 team at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Two games into the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, Galindo along with teammate (of both club and country) Salvador Carmona were separated from the rest of the national team staying in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany. Initially disciplinary problems was the explanation given by the Mexico federation for the separation, the federation later confirmed both players tested positive for performance enhancement drugs. Both men received a one-year ban from competition, which barred Galindo from playing in the 2005 Apertura, 2006 Clausura seasons, and the 2006 FIFA World Cup. ===H\u00e9rcules CF=== Galindo signed in the summer of 2006 with H\u00e9rcules CF of the Spanish second division. Despite being considered a major signing by the club he played very few games and was on the bench for most of the season. ===Grasshopper Club Z\u00fcrich=== Galindo signed a contract with Swiss team Grasshopper Club Z\u00fcrich in February 2007. Galindo capped his first goal with Grasshopper Club Z\u00fcrich and in the Swiss Super League on 17 February 2007 against FC Thun. He scored the first goal in the match for Grasshoppers in the 49th minute. The goal came after teammate Diego Le\u00f3n's pass to Sreto Risti\u0107, who in turn gave a through pass to Galindo. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Galindo's shot ended up in Thun's nets. His first goal contributed to Grasshoppers' 2\u20130 win over Thun. ===Eintracht Frankfurt=== On 28 July 2007, it was announced that Galindo had signed a two-year contract at the German club Eintracht Frankfurt. ===Guadalajara=== On 8 January 2009, Galindo left Frankfurt to return to his native Mexico to play for Club Deportivo Guadalajara to sign a four-year contract. On 28 February 2009, Galindo scored his first goal with Chivas de Guadalajara in a 5\u20130 win over C.F. Pachuca in the Jalisco Stadium. ===Santos Laguna=== On 7 June 2011, Galindo signed with Santos Laguna. ===Toluca=== After seeing less action on the pitch with Santos Laguna he was loaned to Deportivo Toluca on 8 July 2013, where he competes for the starting line up with Paulo Da Silva, Edgar Due\u00f1as and Francisco Gamboa. ===Toledo=== On 1 September 2017, Galindo returned to Spain after agreeing to a contract with CD Toledo. ==Career statistics== ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" |- !colspan=\"7\"|International appearances |- ! # !!
