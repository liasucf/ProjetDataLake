The Sleipner class was part of a Norwegian rearmament scheme started as war became ever more likely in the 1930s. When the Germans invaded Norway on 9 April 1940, \u00c6ger intercepted and sank the clandestine German supply ship . She was shortly afterwards attacked and sunk by German bombers, claiming two of the attacking aircraft with her anti-aircraft armament before being taken out of action by a heavy bomb. ==Construction== \u00c6ger was built at Karljohansvern naval shipyard with yard number 122. She was launched on 25 August 1936. ==Second World War== After the outbreak of the Second World War, \u00c6ger formed part of the Norwegian 2nd Naval District's 2nd Destroyer Division, covering an area roughly the same as the Vestlandet and Tr\u00f8ndelag regions. ===The German invasion=== \u00c6ger was amongst the first Royal Norwegian Navy units to encounter the German invasion forces of Operation Weser\u00fcbung when in the early morning of 9 April 1940 she intercepted the German cargo ship off the port city of Stavanger. ====Roda==== Roda sinking At around 01:00 on 9 April Norwegian customs officers came on board \u00c6ger while she was at anchor in Stavanger and reported their suspicion that the 6,780-ton cargo ship Roda anchored near Ullsnes was probably carrying a different cargo than the 7,000 tons of coke stated in her cargo documents. The German vessel was riding far too high in the water to carry such a cargo. Adding still more suspicion was the fact that the Germans claimed they were bringing the coke to the Norwegian company Sigval Bergesen, a company the customs officers knew had never before taken deliveries of coke.Bj\u00f8rnsen 1977: 27 Although the situation was unclear the Norwegian destroyer's commander, Captain Niels Larsen Bruun, decided to take Roda as a prize.Haarr 2009: 224 When the Norwegian destroyer found the German ship in the Byfjord near Stavanger and signalled that they were going to seize the German vessel the crew of Roda resisted, leading to Captain Larsen Bruun deciding to sink the cargo ship. After the German crew had abandoned their ship, \u00c6ger fired twenty-five 10 cm cold rounds (without explosives) into each side of the vessel, sinking her in deep waters. ====Air attacks==== Colt MG52 12.7 mm anti-aircraft machine gun on the destroyer A short while after the sinking of Roda Luftwaffe aircraft started appearing overhead. At 08:30 the first three of in total ten Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 88 bombers from III/Kampfgeschwader 4 began attacking \u00c6ger at low altitude. Junkers Ju 87s from StG 1 also attacked the ship and have been credited with its sinking. Responding with her single 40 mm Bofors gun and two 12.7 mm Colt anti-aircraft machine guns \u00c6ger claimed two of the attacking bombers shot down while zig- zagging to avoid the stacks of bombs being unleashed at her. However, while trying to avoid an attack by three aircraft all from different directions \u00c6ger was hit amidships by a 250 kg bomb, tearing up the deck of the destroyer and blowing out the sides of the ship. Seven crew members were killed outright, one mortally and three lightly wounded, with the ship being left dead in the water. Three of the dead were officers and five were enlisted men.Sivertsen 2000: 62 As seven more German aircraft continued to attack the crippled destroyer another bomb hit the mast, leaving it bent out of shape but bouncing off into the sea without exploding. Yet another bomb hit the side of the ship midship, but stuck without exploding. All the time the attacking aircraft were pelting the crippled vessel with their machine guns. As all of the ship's anti-aircraft weapons were by now knocked out, Captain Bruun ordered his crew to abandon ship. The entire surviving crew managed to get ashore without any further casualties. ====Aftermath==== The wreck of \u00c6ger near Stavanger in April 1940 Captain Bruun now had fifty-seven unwounded crew members under his command and originally intended to keep his crew together and bring them to unoccupied areas to continue the fight. However, as both Stavanger and the nearby Sola Air Station had been occupied by the invaders, he instead decided to dismiss the crew. He also encouraged them to form small groups and make their way to unoccupied areas to continue the fighting, something a majority of the crew did. The wreck of \u00c6ger later drifted ashore at nearby Hundv\u00e5g and attracted many civilian spectators until removed for scrapping. The three 10 cm main guns of \u00c6ger were removed by the Germans, the first two in May, the third in August 1940, for use as coastal artillery. The guns were deployed as a harbour defence battery at Gr\u00f8demhammeren just north of Stavanger.Fjeld 1999: 232, 264 Rodas cargo later turned out to have been the entire contingent of heavy anti-aircraft guns intended for the defence of Sola Air Station after its capture by German paratroops, the loss of the guns leaving the newly captured air strips vulnerable to RAF attack. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * Category:Ships built in Horten Category:Sleipner-class destroyers Category:World War II destroyers of Norway Category:World War II shipwrecks in the North Sea Category:1936 ships Category:Maritime incidents in April 1940 Category:Destroyers sunk by aircraft Category:Ships sunk by German aircraft ",
