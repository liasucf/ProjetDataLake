A unique case in French literature, he was for a long time considered to be as scandalous a writer as the Marquis de Sade or Nicolas-Edme R\u00e9tif. He was a military officer with no illusions about human relations, and an amateur writer; however, his initial plan was to \"write a work which departed from the ordinary, which made a noise, and which would remain on earth after his death\"; from this point of view he mostly attained his goals with the fame of his masterwork Les Liaisons dangereuses. It is one of the masterpieces of novelistic literature of the 18th century, which explores the amorous intrigues of the aristocracy. It has inspired many critical and analytic commentaries, plays and films. ==Biography== Born in Amiens into a bourgeois family, in 1760 Laclos began studies at the \u00c9cole royale d'artillerie de La F\u00e8re, ancestor of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. As a young lieutenant he briefly served in a garrison at La Rochelle until the end of the Seven Years' War (1763). Postings to Strasbourg (1765\u20131769), Grenoble (1769\u20131775) and Besan\u00e7on (1775\u20131776) followed. In 1763 Laclos became a freemason in \"L'Union\" military lodge in Toul.Dictionnaire Universelle de la Franc-Ma\u00e7onnerie (Marc de Jode, Monique Cara and Jean-Marc CARA \u2013 ed. Larousse 2011) Despite a promotion to the rank of captain (1771), Laclos grew increasingly bored with his artillery garrison duties and with the company of soldiers; he began to devote his free time to writing. His first works, several light poems, appeared in the Almanach des Muses. Later he wrote the libretto for an op\u00e9ra comique, Ernestine, inspired by a novel by Marie Jeanne Riccoboni. The music was composed by the Chevalier de Saint Georges. Its premiere on 19 July 1777, in the presence of Queen Marie Antoinette, proved a failure. In the same year he established a new artillery school in Valence, which would include Napoleon Bonaparte among its students in the mid 1780s. On his return to Besan\u00e7on in 1778 Laclos was promoted second captain of the Engineers. In this period he wrote several works which showed his great admiration of Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712\u20131778). In 1776 Laclos requested and received affiliation with the \"Henri IV\" lodge in Paris. There he helped Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans leading the Grand Orient of France.Ce que la France doit aux francs-ma\u00e7ons (Laurent Kupferman and Emmanuel Pierrat \u2013 Grund ed. 2012) In 1777, in front of the Grand Orient's dignitaries, he delivered a speech in which he urged for the initiation of women into Freemasonry.Dictionnaire Universelle de la Franc- Ma\u00e7onnerie, p. 181 (Marc de Jode, Monique Cara and Jean-Marc Cara \u2013 ed. Larousse 2011) In 1779 he was sent to \u00cele-d'Aix (in present-day Charente- Maritime) to assist Marc Ren\u00e9, marquis de Montalembert in the construction of fortifications there against the British. However, he spent most of his time writing his new epistolary novel, Les Liaisons dangereuses, as well as a Letter to Madame de Montalembert. When he asked for and received six months of vacation, he spent the time in Paris, writing. Durand Neveu published Les Liaisons Dangereuses in four volumes on 23 March 1782; it became a widespread success (1,000 copies sold in a month, an exceptional result for the time). Laclos was immediately ordered to return to his garrison in Brittany; in 1783 he was sent to La Rochelle to collaborate in the construction of the new arsenal. Here he met Marie-Soulange Duperr\u00e9, whom he would marry on 3 May 1786,\"Marie-Soulange Duperr\u00e9\" Pinterest retrieved March 1, 2017 and remain with for the rest of his life. The following year, he began a project of numbering the streets of Paris. In 1788, Laclos left the army, entering the service of Louis Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, for whom, after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, he carried forward with intense diplomatic activity. Captured by Republican ideals, he left the Duke to obtain a place as commissar in the Ministry of War. His reorganization has been credited as having a role in the French Revolutionary Army's victory in the Battle of Valmy (20 September 1792). Later, after the desertion (April 1793) of general Charles Fran\u00e7ois Dumouriez, he was however arrested as an Orleaniste, being freed after the Thermidorian Reaction of 27 July 1794. He thenceforth spent some time in ballistic studies, which led him to the invention of the modern artillery shell. In 1795 he requested of the Committee of Public Safety reintegration in the army, a request which the Committee ignored. His attempts to obtain a diplomatic position and to found a bank also proved unsuccessful. Eventually, Laclos met the young general and recently appointed (November 1799) First Consul, Napoleon Bonaparte, and joined his party. On 16 January 1800 he was reinstated in the Army as Brigadier General in the Army of the Rhine; he took part in the Battle of Biberach (9 May 1800). Made commander-in- chief of Reserve Artillery in Italy (1803), Laclos died shortly afterward in the former convent of St. Francis of Assisi at Taranto, probably of dysentery and malaria. He was buried in the fort still bearing his name (Forte de Laclos) in the Isola di San Paolo near the city, built under his direction. Following the restoration of the House of Bourbon in southern Italy in 1815, his burial tomb was destroyed; it is believed that his bones were tossed into the sea. ==Bibliography== === Novels === * Les Liaisons dangereuses (1782) === Poems === * Po\u00e9sies fugitives (1783) === Plays === * Ernestine (1777, op\u00e9ra comique)http://www.alalettre.com/laclos-biblio.htm === Non-fiction === * Des Femmes et de leur \u00e9ducation (1783) * Folies philosophiques par un homme retir\u00e9 du monde (1784) * Instructions aux assembl\u00e9es de bailliage (1789) * Journal des amis de la Constitution (1790\u20131791) * De la guerre et de la paix (1795) * Continuation des causes secr\u00e8tes de la r\u00e9volution du neuf thermidor (1795) ==References== == Sources == * ==Further reading== * The Dangerous Memoir of Citizen Sade (2000) by A.
