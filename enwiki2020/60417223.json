There, he was able to enroll at the \u00c9cole royale des \u00e9l\u00e8ves prot\u00e9g\u00e9s under the sponsorship of Nicolas Guy Brenet, and entered the studios of Francesco Casanova; completing his studies in 1777. He had several patrons, including , Jean-Georges Wille and Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne. In addition to Casanova, he studied with (1775) and Nicolas-Bernard L\u00e9pici\u00e9 (1776 and 1779).Emmanuel B\u00e9n\u00e9zit, Dictionnaire critique et documentaire des peintres, sculpteurs, dessinateurs et graveurs de tous les temps et de tous les pays, R. Roger et F. Chernoviz, 1919, Vol.3 In 1776, he produced his first major works, in the galant style of Fragonard and Debucourt. In 1778, they were produced as color engravings by . He rapidly became a favorite painter among the high society of his time. Many of his works are f\u00eates galantes featuring actors, dancers and powerful men with their mistresses, engaged in frivolous activities. He entered the service of Christian IV, Count Palatine of Zweibr\u00fccken, and created works for his \"Secret Museum\". Many were of a risqu\u00e9 or lascivious nature. Some were turned into engravings by Gabriel Marchand (c. 1755-18?). Among his later patrons from Strasbourg was the piano maker, S\u00e9bastien \u00c9rard. Despite the variety of his works, and their focus, he described himself as a \"history painter\". His works have also been compared to those of Watteau. In 1787, he married Marie-Catherine Naud\u00e9. During the Directory, due to his association with the Ancien R\u00e9gime he, his wife and children lived in the staircase of a chapel in the Louvre. Later they lived in the phalanstery at the ruins of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s. Once the Revolution had taken a more settled form, he emerged to continue painting, but had to devote himself to more austere, patriotic themes. These included children kissing the feet of Liberty and the heroic actions of William Tell.Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tudes et de publications \u00e9conomiques, Connaissance des arts, 1954, Vol.23-34. The Revolution did not, however, change people's tastes, so he returned to his previous themes as soon as possible. This time, he used mythology as a pretext for painting naked women in bucolic scenes.Petits Th\u00e9\u00e2tres de l\u2019intime : La Peinture de genre fran\u00e7aise entre R\u00e9volution et Restauration. Online, Toulouse, Mus\u00e9e des Augustins. He had major showings at the Salons of 1793, 1798 and 1806. As one might suppose, many of his works were unsigned and, during the 19th century, were variously attributed to Fragonard, Antoine-Fran\u00e7ois Callet and Jean-Baptiste Huet. Some of his early works were signed \"Challe\", possibly to take advantage of the popularity of Charles-Michel-Ange Challe. Eventually, these problems were sorted out and it is now believed that most of his works have been properly attributed. == Selected paintings == File:Heroism of Wilhelm Tell mg 0097.jpg|The Heroism of William Tell File:La Frayeur maternelle, premi\u00e8re partie.jpg|The Mother's Fright File:Schall-Mischievous.png|The Mischievous Ones File:Morgentoilet Rijksmuseum SK-A-3260.jpeg|Morning Toilette File:Schall, Frederic - Zephyr Crowning Flora -.jpg|Zephyrus Crowning Flora ==References== == Further reading == * Andr\u00e9 Girodie, Jean Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Schall (Strasbourg 1752 Paris 1825): Un peintre de f\u00eates galantes, A. & F.
