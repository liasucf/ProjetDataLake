    "text": "Tile Mountain is a company based in Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom that retails tiles commonly used in home decor. The company is notable for creating a multitude of jobs in Stoke-on-Trent following the sale of Longton-based Tile Giant for \u00a312 million in 2007. Tile Mountain's business model includes online sales and providing product samples before large orders. Its products are local as well as from various parts of the globe. Tile Mountain currently has stock including tools, trims, Mapei adhesives and underfloor heating, ceramic and natural stone tiles. Following its expansion, Tile Mountain moved in April 2017 to a new location in Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent, England. The new facilities of 120,000 sq. ft. include a warehouse, a showroom and an office complex. May 9, 2019, Tile Mountain acquired competitor Walls and Floors Ltd, making the Tile Mountain Group (comprising Tile Mountain, Capitol Tiles Distribution, and Tons of Tiles) the fastest growing independently owned tile retailer in Europe. Tile Mountain opened its third UK showroom in June 2020, situated close to Birmingham city centre. The showroom follows the same design concept as the company's Stoke on Trent and Stockport retail spaces and spans 12,000 sq ft across two levels. In September 2020, the company extended its sponsorship deal with Stoke City FC for a further two years, a move that will see the East Stand at the bet365 Stadium continue to be named The Tile Mountain Stand until the 2021/2022 season. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Companies based in Stoke-on-Trent Category:Home improvement companies of the United Kingdom Category:Online retailers of the United Kingdom ",
