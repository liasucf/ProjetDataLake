    "text": "Khawlah bint Hakim () was one of the female companions of Muhammad. She was married to Uthman bin Maz'oon, both being two of the earliest converts to Islam. She was the woman who asked the Prophet whether he would like to marry any woman after the death of Khadijaa, as he had loved Khadija dearly. After the consent of the Prophet, she conveyed the message to Sawda bint Zama (widow of Sakran bin Amr) and Abu Bakr for his daughter Aisha's hand in marriage. ==See also== *Khawlah (name) ==References== Category:Female Sahabah ",
