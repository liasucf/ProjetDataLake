    "text": "The South Carolina Gamecocks women's basketball team represents the University of South Carolina and competes in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The program enjoyed success under head coach Nancy Wilson during the 1980s in the Metro Conference, when it won five regular season conference championships and three conference tournament championships. Under current head coach Dawn Staley, the Gamecocks have been one of the top programs in the country, winning the NCAA Championship in 2017. When the 2019\u201320 season that was cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Gamecocks were ranked atop both major polls. ==History== The Gamecocks first competed at an intercollegiate level in women's basketball in 1923, when they were called the Pullets (a young domestic hen, a play off \"Gamecocks,\" which is a rooster). The modern era of South Carolina women's basketball began when the Carolina Chicks took to the court in January 1974 under the guidance of Pam Backhaus. The inaugural team compiled a record of 15\u20137 and were the South Carolina AIAW champions. In 1977, with Pam Parsons as the head coach the women's basketball team, they changed their nickname to the Lady Gamecocks and made post-season trips every year during her four-year tenure. During its eight seasons in the Metro Conference (now Conference USA after the 1995 reunification), the Lady Gamecocks won the regular season championship five times and the conference tournament three times. When South Carolina joined the SEC, success was hard to come by during their first decade in one of the strongest conferences in women's basketball. They initially struggled to compete under head coaches Nancy Wilson and Susan Walvius. Walvius' teams in 2001\u201302 and 2002\u201303 broke through to finish 25\u20137 and 23\u20138, respectively, earning trips to the NCAA tournament and reaching the Elite Eight in 2002. Walvius resigned after the 2007\u201308 season. On May 7, 2008, Dawn Staley was named the new head coach of the team now known as simply the \"Gamecocks\". Under coach Staley, the Gamecocks improved or equaled their win total every season during her first seven years leading the program, culminating in a 34\u20133 record in 2014\u201315. That year they won the SEC regular season championship, the SEC Tournament championship and the NCAA East Region Championship. The season ended in the NCAA Final Four with a last second one- point loss to Notre Dame in the national semifinals. The following year, the Gamecocks went undefeated in conference play, only to be stymied in the Sweet 16 by Syracuse. In 2016\u201317, the Gamecocks garnered their third straight sweep of the SEC regular season and tournament titles en route to their second Final Four. They defeated conference rival Mississippi State in the national championship game to win their first-ever national title. In the 2018 SEC tournament, the Gamecocks defeated Mississippi State to win the SEC tournament, South Carolina is the only team to win the SEC tournament for four straight years. Their season came to an end when they were defeated by Connecticut in the Elite Eight. In 2020, South Carolina finished 32\u20131 (16\u20130), led by the #1 ranked recruiting class and senior leadership of point guard Tyasha Harris. The Gamecocks defeated 14 ranked teams including their first- ever victory over UConn, and won both the SEC regular season and tournament titles. However, South Carolina's record was marred by a surprisingly lopsided loss to an Indiana team that finished the season ranked #20 (AP poll) and #22 (coaches' poll). South Carolina won their final 26 games of the season and spent the final nine weeks as the AP #1 ranked team. Dawn Staley was named national coach of the year, and Aliyah Boston was named national freshman of the year, and SEC defensive player of the year. When the COVID-19 pandemic ended the season prematurely on March 12, South Carolina was ranked at the top of the AP and coaches' polls. ==Head coaches== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ ! Name !
