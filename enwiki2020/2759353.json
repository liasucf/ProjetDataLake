    "text": "Funky Flashman is a fictional character, an entrepreneur in the DC Universe. Created by Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in the pages of Mister Miracle during the early 1970s. He is popularly considered a satiric caricature of Stan Lee, Kirby's former artistic collaborator at Marvel Comics with whom he had a falling-out. Flashman's attempts to rip off Mister Miracle reflect Kirby's view that Lee exploited his work at Marvel in the 1960s. ==Fictional character biography== Nothing is known about Funky's past except that he and his sidekick Houseroy (popularly considered to be a caricature of Roy Thomas)Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee, and the American Comic Book Revolution by Ronin Ro; published by Bloomsbury Publishing, 2008 (via Google Books) were business associates of a Colonel Mockingbird. After Mockingbird's death, Funky and Houseroy lived on monthly allowances (most likely their inheritance from Mockingbird) that were automatically doled out. Noticing that the monthly allowances were getting smaller, Funky decided that he needed a new source of income. In Funky Flashman's first appearance, he unsuccessfully attempts to cash in on the talents of Mister Miracle. Donning a wig and a beard, he meets with Mr. Miracle to interview for the position of his tour manager. Miracle accepts, despite the fact that Big Barda and Oberon object to Flashman's demeanor and tactics. The next day, Mr. Miracle performs several of his escape acts, much to Flashman's delight. Flashman asks for Miracle's secret, and Miracle reveals the mother box he keeps on his shoulder. From around the corner, the two men see Big Barda and the Female Fury Lashina engaged in a struggle. Miracle jumps in to help Barda but Lashina vanishes with the power of her phasing circuits. The two realize the Female Furies have been tracking their whereabouts through the mother box signal. During the skirmish, Flashman decides to leave with the mother box in hand. He takes it back to his residence but cannot make heads or tails of it. He discards the box and decides the gift of Mr. Miracle is too risky. Mother box begins to let out an \"eeeeee\" sound which summons all the Female Furies of Apokolips. Funky cowardly tosses his assistant at the attackers and jumps out the window. His inherited house explodes behind him, and Funky Flashman walks off to live another day.Jack Kirby's Fourth World Omnibus, Volume 3, DC Comics, November 2007.
