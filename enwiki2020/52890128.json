The objective of the game is to eat fish and battle other players in the quest for survival. In this multiplayer arena, bigger fish eat smaller fish with mechanics similar to Agar.io. Eatme.io is in the same genre of io games as Agar.io and Slither.io. It was initially released in Canada only for iOS devices and then launched in Europe and Africa followed by a world wide launch. The game is compatible on Android and iOS devices and also available on the web. ==Game mechanics== EatMe.io is an underwater battle where players fight to become the supreme leader of the water kingdom. The game is played in an ocean themed world. Players needs to eat as much food and fish as possible to grow in size. Each game lasts for 2 minutes and the top 10 players are rewarded with new fish with special skills. A maximum of 15 players can join the game at any given time. Players need to level up to unlock new fish and evolve into other forms of fish. With each quest, players can unlock other fishes with special skills throughout the game. All the different fish have a unique combat power that is useful while battling other players. For example, the turtle has the ability to shoot a bomb at the player attacking it, the octopus has the ability to eject oil to slow down players who are trailing it, and the shark can use its invisibility feature to eat players. As players advance in levels, new techniques and skills are unlocked to battle opponents. During evolution, a player can transform into a similar but stronger type of underwater species. In addition to its special combat powers, a player can split a fish into two or four fish for a quick split attack that can help the player dodge an enemy\u2019s attack or catch up and attack a smaller fish who is faster. There are underwater tournaments where players can battle against 20 other players around the world and unlock rewards. The game also supports in-app purchases, where players can purchase in-app items like gold, shells, fish bowls and tanks from the open shop section. Players can send invites to their friends on Facebook for more rewards. ==Skins== Players are offered fishes with default skins of different colors. To unlock new skins, players can purchase them using shells or unlock them by completing levels. New skins include sharks, turtles, etc. ==Reception== Eatme.io was released to a very positive reception. The game has been praised for its graphics and audio effects.
