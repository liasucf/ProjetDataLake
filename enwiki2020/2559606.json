It is an evolution of the 152mm SpGH DANA self- propelled howitzer. The system features long range, high accuracy and rate of fire, prompt preparation for firing and high level of mobility ensured by a modified TATRA 8x8 chassis. Design of the gun enables to use any NATO standard 155mm ammunition available on the market. The Fire Control System enables for a Multiple Round Simultaneous Impact (MRSI) mode. One of the unique features of ZUZANA is that the gun is mounted externally in between two totally separated compartments of the turret. This makes the crew inherently safe from any potentially dangerous mechanics of the gun and autoloader plus the crew is protected from the gases generated during firing. ==Variants== ===155 mm ShKH Zuzana=== The original wheeled version adopted by the Slovak Army in 1998. ===155 mm ShKH Zuzana 2=== Updated version with a new 52-calibre gun, full 360-degree turret traverse, a new armored cab and further reduced crew of 3 enabled by automation. It has passed Slovak Army trials in December 2009.Roman Kment, 2010, 155 mm ShKH Zuzana 2. Obrana, XVIII, 5, s. 28-29 (Slovak) Slovak army had ordered 25 vehicles (to be delivered in year 2021 and 2022). The new version is claimed to possess Multiple Rounds Simultaneous Impact (MRSI) capability. ===155 mm ShKH Himalaya=== 1990's adaptation of the original system to a tracked chassis required by export customers.
