It aims to be the first resource on polio and post polio syndrome.http://www.britishpolio.org.uk/about-us/our-vision- and-mission/ == Activities == It has around 8,000 members and over 40 branches and groups across the UK. It publishes a bi-monthly newsletter, the bulletin; and campaigns to raise awareness of PPS among healthcare professionals, members of parliament and the general public and supports the efforts of fellow Polio organisations in their attempts to eradicate the disease worldwide.http://www.britishpolio.org.uk/ ==History== The British Polio Fellowship, then called The Infantile Paralysis Fellowship, was founded on 29 January 1939 by Patricia Carey, who had contracted polio aged eight, and Frederic Morena, who had contracted the disease at the age of 42, as a self- help and mutual aid society for those affected by polio. They called a meeting in January 1938 at Bloomsbury, London which was attended by 30 people and which acted as the foundation of the organisation being formed the following year. The first issue of the charity\u2019s newsletter was published in April 1939. On 18 May 1939 a letter from Hugh Moulton, Liberal politician, was published informing the public of the formation of the Infantile Paralysis Fellowship which \"seeks to help the sufferers help themselves and to afford each other mutual aid and sympathy\". The letter went on to say the principal objective of the Fellowship was to help members find work and suggested that there were (at that time) somewhere between 5,000-7,000 people with the after-effects of infantile paralysis in Britain.North, Barry \"Something To Lean On\". The British Polio Fellowship, 1999, p.1-3 Over time the focus of the charity's work has shifted due to the eradication of polio in the UK during the 1980s and the discovery of post-polio syndrome, and the fellowship's work has become more about supporting those with PPS. ==Patrons== *Dr. Moira Anderson OBE *Michael Cassidy CBE *Hannah Gordon *Andy Love MP *Lionel Blair *Sir Bobby Charlton *Joe Fisher http://www.britishpolio.org.uk/about-us/patrons/ ==Ambassadors== *James Crisp *Julia Roberts (QVC presenter) *Anne Wafula Strike MBE *Professor Gareth Williams http://www.britishpolio.org.uk/about- us/ambassadors/ == External links == * British Polio Fellowship Website ==References== Category:Charities for disabled people based in the United Kingdom Category:Disability organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Polio ",
