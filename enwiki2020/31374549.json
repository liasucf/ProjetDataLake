At the March 2011 elections, Grant was elected and received a swing of 14.5% in the traditionally strong Nationals seat, winning 63.7% of the vote on a two-party preferred basis. Grant actually won 60 per cent of the primary vote, enough to take the seat without the need for preferences. Grant defeated the incumbent independent politician Dawn Fardell, ending a 12-year hold by independent candidates. In accordance with electoral procedures, he resigned his commission as a police officer. Due to the resignation of Barry O'Farrell as Premier, and the subsequent ministerial reshuffle by Mike Baird, the new Liberal Leader, in April 2014 Grant was appointed as Minister for Hospitality, Gaming and Racing, Minister for the Arts, and appointed as a member of Cabinet. On 15 October 2014, Andrew Stoner stood down as Nationals leader and Deputy Premier, citing family reasons. On 16 October Grant was elected party leader and the following day he was sworn in as Deputy Premier of New South Wales, assuming the majority of Stoner's former ministerial responsibilities. Following a period of leadership speculation which came to a head on 12 November 2016 after the Nationals' poor performance at the Orange state by-election, on 14 November, Grant, facing a leadership spill, announced his resignation as Nationals leader and Deputy Premier, effective the following day. Following the resignation of Mike Baird as Premier, Gladys Berejiklian was elected as Liberal leader and sworn in as Premier. The Berejiklian ministry was subsequently formed with Grant sworn in as the Minister for Police and the Minister for Emergency Services with effect from 30 January 2017. Grant did not seek re-endorsement for the 2019 state election. On 21 March 2017, ABC News reported with a headline Mr Grant NSW Police Minister fined for using phone in car, says he didn't know it was illegal. The Daily Telegraph reported that Grant was a \"...decorated former police officer...\" and also that \"Mr Grant, who has always tried to ram home road safety messages \u2014 including the dangers of using mobiles behind the wheel...\" ==See also== *First Baird ministry *Second Baird ministry *Berejiklian ministry ==References== ==External links== * National Party \u2013 Troy Grant, Candidate for Dubbo |- |- |- |- Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Deputy Premiers of New South Wales Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:National Party of Australia members of the Parliament of New South Wales Category:Australian police officers Category:People from Maitland, New South Wales Category:21st-century Australian politicians ",
