The airport is designated as a Class 2 principal (minor domestic) airport by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP). ==History== Siargao Airport was built in 1963 by President Diosdado Macapagal. In 2008, President Gloria Arroyo initiated the Super Regions Program to improve economic activity through infrastructure projects. The original airport could accommodate 19-seater planes from Cebu. The airport was renovated and upgraded with the current runway which accommodates larger aircraft carrying more than 70 passengers. ==Airlines and destinations== PAL Express operates daily flights to and from Davao, Cebu, Manila, and Clark utilizing the Bombardier Q400 NextGen aircraft. Cebgo also operates daily flights to and from Cebu and Manila deploying the ATR 72-600 aircraft. ==Incidents and accidents== On February 27, 2018, a SkyJet Airlines British Aerospace 146 overshot the runway. All 73 passengers and four crew members evacuated the aircraft unharmed. The cause of the incident is currently under investigation, but the CAAP is noting a possible bird strike after one of the passengers reported that the pilot attempted to dodge a passing eagle. ==See also== *List of airports in the Philippines ==References== ==External links== * Sayak Airport, Siargao Islands Category:Airports in the Philippines Category:Buildings and structures in Surigao del Norte Category:Transportation in Mindanao ",
