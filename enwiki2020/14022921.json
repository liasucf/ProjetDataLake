    "text": "Anton Reicha, 1815 This article lists compositions by Anton Reicha. At presentAs of 2007. there exists no definitive catalogue of the composer's works, and his music, for the most part, has yet to be studied by scholars. Two principal work lists exist: one by Olga \u0160otolov\u00e1 in her book Anton\u00edn Rejcha: A Biography and Thematic Catalogue and another by Peter Eliot Stone in his article for the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. The former list contains a number of errors;Peter A. Hoyt. \"Review of \"Antonin Rejcha\" by Olga \u0160otolov\u00e1, Deryck Viney (translator).\" Published in Notes, 2nd Ser., Vol. 49, No. 3 (Mar., 1993), pp. 996-998. these were corrected by Stone in his list. The present article contains two overlapping lists derived from Stone, several editions of Reicha's music and a number of library catalogues listed in the References and Notes section. The first list presents only works that were published and assigned opus numbers by Reicha's publishers. These numbers, as is usual, follow the order in which the works were published, rather than the order in which they were composed. The second list is organized by genre. Compositions are sorted chronologically; those with composition and publication dates unknown are listed last. Not included in either lists are works currently considered lost, fragments, and works for which details other than title are unknown. Dates of publication and/or composition are given in parentheses where known. == List of works with opus numbers == * Opus 1: Six Duos for violin and cello (c. 1796\u20138) (possibly by Josef Reicha) ** Number also used for a concertante for two violins, also a work possibly composed by Josef Reicha * Opus 3: Three Duos for violin and cello (c. 1795) * Opus 4: Three Duos for violin and cello (G major, D major, D major) (c. 1798) (possibly by Josef Reicha) * Opus 12: Sinfonica for four flutes in D major (published by Hoffmeister in Leipzig) * Opus 18: Harmonique imit\u00e9e or three Adagios for four flutes * Opus 19: Sonata for four flutes * Opus 20: Variations for two flutes * Opus 21: Three Romances for two flutes (E minor, G major, D major) * Opus 22: 12 Little Duos for two flutes * Opus 23: Diff\u00e9rentes pi\u00e8ces for piano (c. 1796\u20138) * Opus 24: Overture (Prehedra) for strings, wind instruments and timpani in C major (c. 1795) * Opus 25: Eight Duos for two flutes * Opus 26: Trio for three flutes * Opus 27: Quartet for four flutes * Opus 30: Etudes ou Exercices for piano, these include exercises 2, 9, 23 and 24 from Practische Beispiele * Opus 31: Etude de transitions and 2 fantasies for piano (Paris, 1802) * Opus 32: Fugue on a theme by Domenico Scarlatti, for piano (Paris, 1802) * Opus 34: Overture in E major/minor (after 1813) * Opus 36: 36 Fugues for piano (Vienna, 1803) = includes Op. 32 as Fugue No. 9, a Fantasia from Op. 31, Etude No. 9 from Op. 30, exercises 10 and 22 from Practische Beispiele and \"12 Fugues\" of 1799 (no opus number).
