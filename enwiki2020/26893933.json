Systematics and Biodiversity, , 4, . It is the first animal species described that does not require oxygen at any point during its life.Jackson P. (8 April 2010). http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8609246.stm \"First oxygen-free animals found\". BBC News. accessed 16 April 2010.New species 'live without oxygen', The Telegraph, April 9, 2010 The species, along with two other newly discovered species, Rugiloricus nov. sp. and Pliciloricus nov. sp., were found in the sediment of the anoxic L'Atalante basin of the Mediterranean Sea. Electron microscope images show that the species' cellular innards appear to be adapted for a zero-oxygen life. Their mitochondria appear to act as hydrogenosomes, organelles which provide energy in some anaerobic single-celled creatures.Multicelled Animals May Live Oxygen-Free, U.S. News & World Report, April 12, 2010 With a visual resemblance to tiny cups with tentacles sticking out, the species has been said to look like something out of a Dr. Seuss book. At adulthood, this species is characterized by a mouth cone with eight oral ridges, a neck with eight single trichoscalids alternating with seven double trichoscalids, as well as lorical plates with spikes located at the corners. More than 30 species in this group have been described. ==See also== * Anaerobic organism * Anaerobic respiration * Obligate anaerobe ==References== Category:Loricifera Category:Environment of the Mediterranean Category:Invertebrates of Europe Category:Animals described in 2014 ",
