    "text": "Hart House, on the University of Toronto campus. McCaul's Pond was located at the site of Hart House, on the University of Toronto campus. McCaul's Pond was created by damming Taddle Creek in the early 1860s. Increased settlement, and economic activity, had already begun changing the creek from being the clear, free running watercourse early settlers found, so clean it was a breeding ground for salmon, to a polluted watercourse. Damming the creek accelerated the dangers and the pond was drained prior to burying the University's portion of the creek in 1884. ==References== Category:Ponds of Toronto ",
