It was built in the 10th century and is one of the oldest gates in the city. Its name 'mardum' is Arabic for 'blocked up'. Perhaps because its function was taken over by the Puerta del Sol. The Spanish name Valmard\u00f3n is a rough, phonetic imitation of the Arabic. 'Mezquita Bab al-Mardum' is another name for the nearby Mosque of Cristo de la Luz. ==External links== * Castilla-La Mancha, Descubre u siente *Page at Archnet Bab al-Mardum Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 10th century ",
