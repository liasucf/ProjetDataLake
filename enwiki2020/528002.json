It has two campuses: historic lakeside campus in Oswego and Metro Center in Syracuse, New York. SUNY Oswego was founded in 1861 as the Oswego Primary Teachers Training School by Edward Austin Sheldon, who introduced a revolutionary teaching methodology Oswego Movement in American education. In 1942 the New York Legislature elevated it from a normal school to a degree-granting teachers' college, Oswego State Teachers College, which was a founding and charter member of the State University of New York system in 1948. In 1962 the college broadened its scope to become a liberal arts college. SUNY Oswego currently has over 80,000 living alumni. Oswego State offers more than 100 academic programs leading to bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and certificates of advanced study. It consists of four colleges and schools: College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, School of Business, School of Education, and School of Communications, Media and the Arts. ==Campus== Campus as viewed from Glimmerglass Lagoon Founded in the city of Oswego by Sheldon to train teachers to meet pressing educational needs, the college moved to its current location on the shore of Lake Ontario in 1913 after Sheldon Hall was constructed. The current campus is located on along Lake Ontario. Development of the campus was planned by the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, who designed the major buildings. The campus today consists of 46 buildings with classrooms, laboratories, residential and athletic facilities. Recent years have witnessed the launch of a $700 million campus-wide renovation and renewal program, with the new Campus Center acting as the social hub of campus. Shineman Center for Science, Engineering, and Innovation. ===Marano Campus Center Complex=== The college's new social hub, known as the Marano Campus Center Complex, which opened in the fall of 2007, includes new construction and renovation of the existing Swetman/Poucher complex. The $25.5 million Marano Campus Center portion, the new construction, includes a convocation hall and ice arena, food court, box office, fireplace lounge, breakfast nook and reservable spaces. The renovated portions of the building house The Compass (student services), The Point (student involvement), a student media center with WNYO, WTOP and The Oswegonian newspaper, Copy Center, and Fresh\u00ebns Cafe.

This image was taken outside of Waterbury Hall. Physically separate from the main campus, on the other side of New York State Route 104, is the south campus, consisting of Laker Hall (indoor sports, coaching classrooms, and athletic training rooms), Romney Fieldhouse (a Quonset hut that hosted the Laker hockey program until fall 2006) and several athletic fields. In addition, more than of Rice Creek Field Station (for biological research and public programs) are on the South Campus.

Due to a shortage in residential rooms in fall 2008 caused by greater enrollment and on-campus living requests than expected, several rooms were offered in renovated conference/hotel space in Sheldon Hall. The Village, a new townhouse village with apartment living was constructed south of Glimmerglass Lagoon, and opened in the fall 2010 semester. Students with 57 credits who are enrolled full-time, and have lived on campus for a complete semester (as a transfer student) or three semesters (entering Oswego as a freshman), are allowed to live there. All town homes in the Village come with their own washer and dryer as well as a full size refrigerator. In the fall of 2013 the outdated Science and Mathematics building, Snygg Hall, was closed, and the new Richard S. Shineman Center for Science, Engineering and Innovation was opened to all STEM students: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. The building, built onto the older Piez Hall, offers views of the college's Lakeside Community and Lake Ontario from the meteorology observation deck.

SUNY Oswego's athletic teams are known as the Lakers. Oswego is a member of NCAA Division III and teams compete in the State University of New York Athletic Conference for most sports. Women's ice hockey plays in the ECAC West, as that sport is not offered by the SUNYAC. Oswego is traditionally a rival of Plattsburgh State. The rivalry currently manifests mostly in ice hockey; in the 1990s and early 2000s, Oswego fans would regularly throw bagels onto the ice when the Lakers scored against Plattsburgh, responding to a tradition where Plattsburgh fans threw tennis balls on the rink after goals versus Oswego. The tradition ended in 2006, after Oswego was assessed a delay of game penalty for the bagel throw: Plattsburgh scored on the ensuing power-play to win the game, which cost the Lakers a national tournament berth. In addition, the Campus Center arena was opened that year which allowed the university to more closely monitor and shut down fans who brought in bagels. The \"Puck Flattsburgh\" spoonerism is a common rallying cry. Oswego and Plattsburgh also had a rivalry in football, but Oswego ceased sponsoring the sport in 1976, with Plattsburgh following in 1978. ===Men's=== * Baseball * Basketball * Cross country * Golf * Ice hockey * Indoor track and field * Lacrosse * Outdoor track and field * Soccer * Swimming and diving * Tennis * Wrestling ===Women's=== * Ice hockey * Basketball * Cross country * Field Hockey * Indoor track and field * Lacrosse * Outdoor track and field * Soccer * Softball * Swimming and diving * Tennis * Volleyball ===National Championships=== On March 18, 2007, the Oswego State men's ice hockey team won the 2006\u201307 NCAA Division III ice hockey National Championship, the first NCAA championship ever for the school. ==Clubs and student organizations== Oswego has over 180 clubs and organizations, many funded by the Student Association.

Students put on white T-shirts, start at the Front Door Tavern on East 10th and Utica Streets, and make their way down Bridge Street (New York State Route 104) in Oswego. They stop at all participating bars along the way on or within a block of Bridge Street to have their shirts signed. The event has been a tradition in various forms at SUNY Oswego for over 30 years. The college officially discourages the practice.Curtis, Aaron (2009-05-08). Police keep busy during annual Bridge Street Run. The Palladium-Times. Retrieved 2009-05-10. It was finally banned by the city in 2014 following a students death caused by a heroin overdose on campus;Oswego Common Council votes to ban Bridge Street Run, bill SUNY Oswego for city's costs Local Syr.com. Retrieved 2014-05-13. the following year, the college set up OzFest, a campus festival, to deter partiers from participating in the Bridge Street Run. However, students still continue the tradition each spring.Sturtz. Ken (May 10, 2015).SUNY Oswego offers new event to tamp Bridge Street Run; cops make fewer arrests. Syracuse.com. Retrieved May 11, 2015. * QUEST \u2013 Quest is a symposium dedicated to sharing the scholarly and creative pursuits of faculty, staff and student of the State University of New York at Oswego. Students usually work in collaboration with faculty mentors in preparation of their projects. The series also features a keynote speaker who discusses a topical issue in a field such as technology, science or politics. There are no classes before 5pm on Quest Day, which falls on a Wednesday in early to mid-April. * Torchlight Ceremony \u2013 Every year on the night before commencement day, the university holds the Torchlight Ceremony to honor each year's graduates and pass candlelights as \"passing the torch.\" A representative of each year's graduate of SUNY Oswego is invited to this event to pass the torch. In addition to this, the new freshman class partakes in a Torchlight Ceremony of their own on the night of \"Freshman Move-In Day\" in August. * OzFest \u2013 This new annual tradition is held on the last day of classes during the spring semester in May. Students enjoy carnival-like activities on campus to celebrate the conclusion of the academic year, and to relieve stress before finals week. The festival culminates with a concert that is held in the Marano Campus Center. The concert typically features known-artists. It has been theorized that OzFest was partially planned to give students another option to consider before partaking in Bridge Street Run, which has been officially banned by the City of Oswego, as stated above. * LakerFest \u2013 This is a festival that has typically been held on a weekend during the month of September. It can be described as a \"mini OzFest\" in the sense it is not as popular as OzFest, and there is no concert in addition to the festival being smaller in general. * White-Out Weekend \u2013 White-Out Weekend refers to the highly anticipated rivalry matchup between the Oswego State Men's Hockey team (Lakers) and the SUNY Plattsburgh Men's Hockey team. Students will line up in the Marano Campus Center as early as 3 to 4 hours in advance of the game, and tickets are often sold out. The Lakers will typically play the SUNY Potsdam Men's Hockey team as well either the night before, or the night after, and is also a White-Out game. The Women's team plays their own respective game as well. ==Notable faculty== * Doug Lea, current Interim Chair of Computer Science * Roy Lichtenstein, pop artist; taught in the Art Department 1958\u20131960 * Sir Kenneth O.
