    "text": "The Gardiner Building on the Long Wharf in Boston, now a Chart House restaurant The Gardiner Building, located on the Long Wharf in Boston, Massachusetts, is a brick Colonial style warehouse built in 1763 and rebuilt in 1812. At one time it was used as John Hancock's counting house. Long Wharf was once filled with this kind of building, but this is the only one remaining; it is the wharf's oldest surviving structure. The building was renovated in 1973 by Anderson, Notter, Feingold. It is currently a Chart House seafood restaurant. The Gardiner Building features a slate roof and \"six-over- six\" windows with shutters. The lintels and sills are granite. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1763 establishments in Massachusetts Category:Boston Harbor Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1763 Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1812 Category:Buildings and structures in Boston Category:History of Boston Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts Category:Landmarks in Financial District, Boston Category:National Historic Landmarks in Boston Category:National Register of Historic Places in Boston ",
