    "text": "Nicolau dos Reis Lobato (24 May 1946 \u2013 31 December 1978) was an East Timorese politician who is considered a national hero. He was born in Soibada, Portuguese Timor. Lobato was the 1st Prime Minister of East Timor from 28 November to 7 December 1975. Upon the invasion by the Indonesian military, Lobato, along with other key Fretilin leaders, fled into the Timorese hinterland to fight against the occupying forces. On the final day of 1978 Lobato was ambushed by Indonesian special forces led by Lieutenant Prabowo Subianto (later son-in-law of President Suharto) at Mount Mindelo. He was killed after being shot in the stomach, and his body was brought to Dili to be inspected by Indonesian press. What then happened to his body is unknown, but the East-Timorese government continues to pursue the issue with the Indonesian government, so that his remains can be given a proper burial.East Timor's latest attempt to find the body of its first prime minister Nicolau dos Reis Lobato ABC News, 21 February 2018.
