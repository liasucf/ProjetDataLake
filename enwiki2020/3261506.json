It was also entered into the 19th Moscow International Film Festival. ==Plot== Two old brothers, Moe and Pa, have lived together for their whole life and are content with their daily and weekly routine. This is disturbed later by the arrival of Pa's grown-up and disabled son Konrad, whose existence (due to a two-day trip of Pa to Sm\u00e5land, the only time Pa and Moe were separated) was unknown to Moe. The weirdness of Konrad and the jealousy of Moe and Konrad then disturb the routine, and Moe leaves home in the end. ==Cast== * Sverre Hansen as Moe * Kjell Stormoen as Pa * Leif Andr\u00e9e as Konrad * Juni Dahr as Cylindia Volund * Ulf Weng\u00e5rd as Vernon * Trond H\u00f8vik as Blomdal * Alf Conrad Olsen as Jim * Leif Malmberg as Priest ==References== ==External links== Category:1995 films Category:1995 comedy films Category:Films directed by Bent Hamer Category:Norwegian films Category:Norwegian-language films Category:Norwegian comedy films ",
