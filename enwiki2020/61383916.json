The species is native to southeastern Central America and northwestern South America. There are two recognized subspecies. ==Etymology== The specific name, southi, is in honor of John Glover South (1873\u20131940), who was an American physician and diplomat.Beolens B, Watkins M, Grayson M (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore, Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Leposoma southi, p. 248). ==Geographic range== L. southi is found in Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia. ==Reproduction== L. southi is oviparous. ==Subspecies== Two subspecies are recognized as being valid, including the nominotypical subspecies: *Loxopholis southi orientalis *Loxopholis southi southi Nota bene: A trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than Loxopholis. ==References== ==Further reading== *Goicoechea N, Frost DR, De la Riva I, Pelligrino KCM, Sites J Jr, Rodrigues MT, Padial JM (2016). \"Molecular systematics of teioid lizards (Teioidea/Gymnophthalmoidea: Squamata) based on the analysis of 48 loci under tree-alignment and similarity-alignment\".
