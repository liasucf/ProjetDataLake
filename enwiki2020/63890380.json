    "text": "The 1737 Valdivia earthquake struck south-central Chile on December 24. Together with earthquakes in 1575 and 1837 the earthquake is among the historical predecessors to the great 1960 earthquake. While the overlap in affected areas is significant relative to the 1837 earthquake the 1737 earthquake may have occurred slightly more to the north. The earthquake was felt in Concepci\u00f3n but most damage occurred in the towns of Valdivia and Castro, Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago. In both of these locations churches were destroyed by the earthquake. In addition the Valdivian Fort System and the Royal Storehouse of Valdivia took heavy damage. Landslides occurred next to Villarrica, Calafqu\u00e9n, and Ri\u00f1ihue lakes. Over all this indicates the rupture zone was about 640 km long, with most damage being concentrated in the middle section (Valdivia). There is no evidence the earthquake would have produced a tsunami. ==See also== *Huilliche uprising of 1712 *Mapuche uprising of 1723 *1730 Valpara\u00edso earthquake *1741 wreckage of HMS Wager *1751 Concepci\u00f3n earthquake *Mapuche uprising of 1766 ==References== Category:Megathrust earthquakes in Chile Valdivia earthquake Valdivia earthquake Category:History of Araucan\u00eda Region Category:History of Los R\u00edos Region Category:History of Los Lagos Region Category:Earthquake stubs Category:History of Chilo\u00e9 Category:December events ",
