Marais (bapt. 11 October 1665, Paris-21 June 1737, Paris) was a French jurist and lawyer at the Parlement of Paris. He is later known by the edition of his Journal and Memoirs by Mathurin de Lescures. ==Life== Mathieu Marais was born in Paris, in the rue du Bouloi. His baptismal certificate is dated of October 11, 1665 at the Church of St Eustache of Paris. Because of the high infant mortality, infants were baptized the same day or a few days after their birth, so his date of birth was conjectured to be October 10. His father is Renault Marais, prosecutor at the Grand Ch\u00e2telet, and his mother is Catherine-Fran\u00e7oise Billon. He have Mathieu Billon, Parisian bourgeois, and Claude Billon, daughter of Guillaume Billon, the King's cirier, for godparents.Mathieu Marais, Journal and Memoirs, vol.1, 1863. He spent twelve years with the Jesuits, then became a lawyer the November 22, 1688 before retiring in 1736. It was long thought that he had ended his career as b\u00e2tonnier, but it was actually Jean Marais (or Marays).Mathieu Marais, in a letter to president Bouhier dated of September 5, 1724, said that Jean Marais sometimes printed his name \"Marays\" or \"Marais\". J. Marais wrote Memoirs, and a Discours sur la d\u00e9tractation sur la l\u00e9gitime entre les enfants (Discourse on the Detraction on Legitimacy Between Children) in 1693. Mathieu didn't like this man, of whom he was \"neither his relative nor his ally\". (Cf. Correspondance litt\u00e9raire du pr\u00e9sident Bouhier n\u00b08 : Lettres de Mathieu Marais (1724-1737), vol.1, 1974.) His nickname was \"the lawyer of the women\" (l'avocat des dames), because he pleaded for a lot of them. He aspired to French Academy. He was very fond of Jean de La Fontaine, and the wrote an Histoire de la vie et des ouvrages de M. de La Fontaine (History of The Life and Works of Mr. de La Fontaine) published in 1811 by Simon Chardon de La Rochette. He was in contact with several personalities of his time, including Nicolas Boileau, the Chancellor d'Aguesseau, the Cardinal Polignac, the Viscount Charles-Henri-Gaspard de Saulx of Tavannes, and also the financier Samuel Bernard. His greatest friend remains to be the president Bouhier to whom he sends, sick and dying, a letter on February 1, 1737, where are written journals of his hand; he recommends keeping them in his library of manuscripts so that they do not fall into the wrong hands. He would have contributed to the Mercure galant for the criticism of Madame de Lambert about Mr. de Sacy's translation of Panegyric of Trajan by Pliny the Younger. As a friend of Pierre Bayle, he collaborated at the Historical and Critical Dictionary by writing the articles Henry III, Henry, Duke of Guise and Margaret, Queen of Navarre among others.Pierre and Firmin Didot, Nouvelle biographie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, vol.33, 1860. His funeral took place at the same St Eustache Church where he was baptized.Louis Gabriel Michaud, Biographie universelle ancienne et moderne, vol.26, 1860. ==Notes== Category:1665 births Category:1737 deaths Category:17th-century French writers Category:17th-century male writers Category:18th-century French writers Category:18th-century male writers Category:French letter writers Category:French diarists Category:French literary critics Category:French memoirists Category:French male non-fiction writers ",
