    "text": "{| |+Type C3 |} Type C3-class ships were the third type of cargo ship designed by the United States Maritime Commission (MARCOM) in the late 1930s. As it had done with the Type C1 ships and Type C2 ships, MARCOM circulated preliminary plans for comment. The design presented was not specific to any service or trade route, but was a general purpose ship that could be modified for specific uses. The C3 was larger and faster than the C1 and C2 contemporaries, measuring from stem to stern (vs. for the C2), and designed to make (vs. for the C2). Like the C2, it had five cargo holds. A total of 465 of these ships were built between 1940 and 1947. During World War II, many C3 ships were converted to naval uses, particularly as s, and as and s, Klondike- class destroyer tenders, submarine tenders, and seaplane tenders. ==Ships in type== *C3 DWT 12,595 as in *C3-A DWT 10,000 as in *C3-E DWT 9,514 as in *C3-P&C; DWT 10,000 some converted to *C3-S-A1 DWT 12,595 as in some converted to *C3-S-A2 DWT 12,595 as in *C3-S1-A3 DWT 12,595 as in *C3-S-A4 DWT 11,000 the six President ships *C3-S-A5 DWT 11,800 as in *C3-S1-BR1 DWT 9,900, three built: Del Norte, Del Sud & Del Mar *C3-S-BH1 DWT 12,600 five built: Tillie Lykes, Almeria Lykes, Lipscomb Lykes, Norman Lykes & Doctor Lykes *C3 Mod.
