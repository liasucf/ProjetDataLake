The summit is topped by a and deep crater that is breached on the southern rim believed to have been caused by the 1730 eruption. Prior to 1730, a lake occupied the summit crater of Mount Banahaw.

The mountain and its environs are considered sacred by local residents; the water from its sacred springs are deemed \"holy water\" for allegedly having beneficial qualities, issuing forth from locations called \"puestos\" or \"holy sites\". These sites are unique natural features composed not only of springs, but also caves, streams and boulders; with names with biblical allusions, and shrines erected in, on or around them. These locations were allegedly revealed to a man named Agripino Lontoc by the \"Santong Boses\" or the \"Holy Voices\", which also gave the names to these places way back during the Spanish colonial sra.
