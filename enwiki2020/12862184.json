It is native to the Philippines, the Maluku region of eastern Indonesia, New Guinea and the western Pacific (Melanesia and Micronesia). The genus was named by Caspar Reinwardt in 1825. Seven of the New Caledonian species previously included in Bikkia were transferred to a separate genus, Thiollierea, in 2011 based on molecular and morphological information.Barrab\u00e9 L., Mouly A., Lowry II P.
