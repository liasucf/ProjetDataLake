    "text": "The Mustangs are a British blues rock band that was formed in Hampshire in 2001. Signed to the Skyfire Records label, they have released 11 albums, including Split Decision, which reached number 5 on the iTunes blues chart. They are unusual on the blues rock circuit as their albums are made of entirely original material. The Mustangs were nominated for Best Band at the 2010 British Blues Awards. The band's drummer, Jonathan Bartley, is co-leader of The Green Party of England and Wales. They are regarded as one of the most long-running and established bands on the UK blues rock circuit. ==Details== The Mustangs were formed by Adam Norsworthy and Derek Kingaby after an impromptu jam session in the Fountain Pub in Rowland's Castle, Hampshire, in 2001. The Mustangs first came to national attention after winning the Eel Pie Club's Search for New Blues Talent competition in 2004. The Mustangs have played and headlined a wide variety of gigs and blues festivals across the UK and Europe including Glastonbury Festival, Colne, Maryport, Blues on The Farm, Newark, Swanage, Skegness, Hyde Park, Goodwood, Zinc Paris, Gosport and Southsea. Their concerts showcase singer Norsworthy's dynamic energy: he runs and jumps about the stage throughout each concert, whilst maintaining a visible camaraderie with the other band members. Musician magazine has called them \"compulsory for British blues rock fans\".Musician, September 2006 Record Collector magazine wrote of their \"musical depth, sheer balls and plenty of heart and soul\". As well as their own material, in concert the group often plays some blues standards, though radically reinterpreting the arrangement to suit the band's \"truly storming... ferocious\" sound. These include Lead Belly's \"Hands Off\", Troyce Keane's \"Annie Maybe\" and Cyril Davies \"Countryline Special\". Chiefly influenced by the British blues rock bands of the 1960s, such as Led Zeppelin and Fleetwood Mac, as well as Dr. Feelgood, the Mustangs also draw on more traditional blues influences such as Muddy Waters, Elmore James and Robert Johnson. The band's use of blues harp, played by Derek Kingaby, adds to an authentic, traditional blues sound. In recent years the band has expanded into folk, country and even progressive rock in its songwriting. The band's nine studio albums to date have been well received. Blues In Britain magazine selected Nothing Stays the Same as one of its 20 albums of the year. Blues Matters magazine said of the same record, \"This outfit has the potential to change how British blues is perceived and received.\"Dave Stone, Blues Matters May/June 2008, issue 43 Rock'n'Reel magazine called Split Decision \"the very definition of blues rock\". The majority of the songwriting is by Norsworthy, but all four members of the band have contributed songs to the albums. The band's fifth album, Cut Loose, received a 5 star review in the May 2010 issue of R2 magazine, with reviewer Brian Smith commenting, \"Cut Loose is a real treat...it drips with musicianship..it is infectiously funky...and downright beautiful.\" In the same year, as well as being nominated for best band at the British Blues Awards, Ben Mckeown and Jon Bartley were nominated for an award in their own instrument categories, Mckeown for Best Bass Guitarist and Bartley for Best Drummer. The band's sixth album, Shaman & the Monkey, was released in October 2011. Blues in Britain said \"the album continues the Mustangs\u2019 way with a catchy tune, first class musicianship and production values, and is worth adding to any serious blues/rock music collection.\"Blues In Britain, 1 December 2011 The band supported the release with a number of shows at high profile blues festivals across the UK including Maryport, Cambridge, Swanage, Newark and the Isle of Wight.
