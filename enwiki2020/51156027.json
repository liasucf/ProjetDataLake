The Ordinariate for the Faithful of Eastern Rite in Spain is an Ordinariate (pseudo-diocese) for all non-Latin Catholic faithful living in Spain who belong to the particular Churches sui iuris of any Eastern rite immediately subject to the Holy See. ==History== It was erected on 9 June 2016 by Pope Francis, who also named the current Archbishop of Madrid, Carlos Osoro Sierra, as its first Ordinary.Conferencia Episcopal Espa\u00f1ola, El Papa crea un Ordinariato para los fieles cat\u00f3licos orientales en Espa\u00f1a y nombra Ordinario a Mons. Osoro (June 9, 2016) Its creation was a response to the increase of Eastern Catholics in Spanish territory, until then spiritually assisted by the various local dioceses. The Spanish Episcopal Conference already had a pastoral care department for the faithful of oriental rites, who in 2003 drew up the document Orientations for the pastoral care of Eastern Catholics in Spain. The Ordinariate has jurisdiction over all the Catholic faithful of the Eastern rite who live in Spain and may appoint vicars general, having appointed the presbyter Andr\u00e9s Mart\u00ednez Esteban for that position. Like the Ordinariate for Eastern Catholics in France, the ordinary has a personal jurisdiction over the Eastern faithful that is cumulative with the diocesan bishops, from whom he must obtain consent for the decisions that pertain to their respective dioceses, and that retain secondary jurisdiction in minor matters (unlike other oriental ordinariates in what the ordinary has full jurisdiction). It must also require the consent of the primate and synods of the Eastern Churches in the decisions that involve them and obtain from them the clergy of the Ordinariate. Between May 2 and 4, 2017 the ordinary met with the priests of the 3 oriental rites present in Spain to advance in the constitution of the Ordinariate. ==Territory== The Ordinariate has jurisdiction over the Catholic faithful of all Eastern rites living in Spain. Its seat is the city of Madrid. ===Eastern Catholic communities in Spain=== Eastern Catholics in Spain are mainly from the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church and from the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, both of Byzantine rite. There are also communities of the Syro Malabar Catholic Church. A small Coptic Catholic community that existed in Spain no longer existed at the time of the erection of the Ordinariate, as its faithful migrated to other European countries. ==== Romanian Greek-Catholic Church ==== On March 16, 2009 the Cardinal and Archbishop of Madrid Antonio Maria Rouco Varela appointed the priest Bogdan Vasile Buda as chaplain responsible for the Romanian community of Byzantine rite residing in the archdiocese of Madrid. In April 2009 he assigned a chapel of the parish of Our Lady of Sorrows in Madrid for the pastoral care of the Romanian faithful of the Byzantine rite of his archdiocese. The community is called Capelania Greco-Catolic\u0103 din Madrid Botezul Domnului (Baptism of the Lord). On March 1, 2012 Bogdan Vasile Buda was named archpriest (protopopul) by the Cardinal Primate of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, Lucian Mure\u015fan, and by the archiepiscopal major synod, becoming the national leader of the Romanian Greek Catholic faithful and priests of Spain (Greco-Romanian Catholic Deanery (arciprestazgo) of Madrid). The archpriest has 8 priests serving two parishes and 6 chaplaincies: * Diocese of Orihuela-Alicante: the chaplaincy is in the church of San Roque in Alicante, with masses once a month in the church of San Pedro and San Pablo de Torrevieja * Diocese of Almer\u00eda: chaplaincy in the church of the Holy Family of Almer\u00eda (Sf\u00e2nta Familie) * Diocese of Ciudad Real: in the church of the Remedios of Ciudad Real * Archdiocese of Granada: existing since 2006, the priest serves in the communities of Castell de Ferro (parish church Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Carmen), Motril (in the church of Carmen) and Granada (in the Virgen del Carmen church, which has a pastoral with gypsies) * Diocese of Mallorca: a community in the Oratory of San Telm in Palma de Mallorca * Diocese of Calahorra and La Calzada-Logro\u00f1o: Romanian Greek Catholic parish of San Nicol\u00e1s in Calahorra (Parohia Greco-Catolic\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103 Sf\u00e2ntul Nicolae) * Diocese of Le\u00f3n: the Romanian Greek Catholic parish of Le\u00f3n (Pogor\u00e2rea Sf\u00e2ntului Spirit, in the church of the Railway Orphans of Le\u00f3n and in the chapel of Caritas Diocesana de Benavente).
