    "text": "The Taming of the Shrew () is a 1967 American-Italian romantic comedy film based on the play of the same name by William Shakespeare about a courtship between two strong-willed people. The film was directed by Franco Zeffirelli and stars Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton as Shakespeare's Kate and Petruchio. ==Plot== Baptista Minola is attempting to marry off his two daughters; however, he will marry off his youngest, Bianca only if someone will marry his eldest, Katharina. Katharina is an ill-tempered shrewish woman but a lusty young nobleman, Petruchio, takes on the challenge of taming and marrying her. A subplot involves the wooing of Bianca by several suitors including handsome Lucentio, foppish Hortensio, and elderly Gremio. ==Cast== *Elizabeth Taylor as Katharina *Richard Burton as Petruchio *Michael York as Lucentio *Michael Hordern as Baptista Minola *Natasha Pyne as Bianca *Alan Webb as Gremio *Victor Spinetti as Hortensio *Alfred Lynch as Tranio *Mark Dignam as Vincentio *Roy Holder as Biondello *Cyril Cusack as Grumio ==Production details== The film, made in English but shot in Italy, cuts much of the original dialogue, including much of the subplot of Lucentio and Bianca, and all of the Christopher Sly framing device. Taylor plays Kate\u2019s final, controversial speech without any obvious irony (such as Mary Pickford\u2019s wink in the 1929 film); however, her taming is apparently undercut by her quick exit from the banquet, which forces Burton\u2019s Petruchio to chase after her amid jeers from the other men. According to Harold Bloom's take on the play, Katherina is \u201cadvising women how to rule absolutely, while feigning obedience\u201d. The film was originally intended to be a vehicle for Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. Taylor and Burton put over a million dollars into the production and, instead of a salary, took a percentage of profits. The film made $12 million worldwide and was generally liked by the critics. ==Reception== ===Box office=== The Taming of the Shrew grossed $8 million in North America, earning $3,540,000 in theatrical rentals during 1967, Please note these figures refer to rentals accruing to the distributors. making it the 25th highest grossing picture of 1967.
