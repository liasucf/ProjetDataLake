    "text": "Michelle Vieth (; born Michelle Vieth Paetau November 19, 1979) is an American born Mexican actress and model, best known for starring in telenovelas. == Biography == Michelle's mother and father met in Marshalltown, Iowa. United States. Her mother's family lived in Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico at that time. Her father and his side of the family are from Marshalltown. For that reason from a young age Michelle was flying back and forth through both countries. At the age of 15 while in Acapulco she was invited as an extra in the telenovelas \"El Premio Mayor\" produced by Emilio Larrosa, \"Acapulco, Cuerpo y Alma\" produced by Jose Alberto Castro and its English version produced by Carlos Sotomayor. But It was VP of Televisa and Producer Valent\u00edn Pimstein's last discovery for the company after discovering figures like Veronica Castro and Thalia. Pimstein saw something unique in Michelle so he took her to Mexico City and his team of specialists, who then decided that Michelle was going to be enrolled at the Centro de Educaci\u00f3n Artistica (CEA) to study acting and modeling. Almost a year later, Pedro Dami\u00e1n, who was part of Valentin's team, called her and offered her to be Mi Peque\u00f1a Traviesa, marking her debut in television as an actress. In 2004, she was on Big Brother Celebrity VIP2 Mexico, and exited the fourth week of the show, finishing in 11th place. ==Personal life== Vieth was married to Hector Soberon from 2001 to 2004, and the marriage was later annulled. She was engaged but never married to Leandro Ampudia from 2004 to 2010, with whom she had a son, Leandro (born 2005), and a daughter, Michelle (born 2007). Since 2011, she's been in a long-term relationship with Christian Aparicio, and they have a son, Christian Aparicio, Jr. (born 2014), and a daughter, Selika (born 2016). More than a decade ago, a video appeared in the web in which the actress appeared naked, a situation that she still considers heartbreaking and difficult to overcome. Vieth supports a citizen initiative that seeks the approval of the Vengeance Pornography Law, to prevent harassment through the network and the circulation of unauthorized sexual content of which she herself was a victim. After living it in her own flesh, Vieth contacted women's rights defender Matan Uziel from Real Women Real Stories, who helped her to remove the content from the internet.Tras video porno, Michelle Vieth ahora lucha contra el contenido sexual no autorizado ==Filmography== {| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;\" |-bgcolor=\"#75B2DD\" align=\"center\" ! colspan=\"5\" | Telenovelas, Series, Theater, TV Show |-bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\" !
