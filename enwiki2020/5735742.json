It was directed by Scott Thomas and written by James Becket, Fabian Carrillo and Scott Thomas. ==Plot== In the grand tradition of the lone hero who mysteriously appears in a town desperate for help (think \"Shane, \"Billy Jack\", \"James Bond\" and \"Chinese Connection\"), having survived a war and now serving the government as an undercover agent, Danny Silva takes on his biggest foe yet: the street gangs that have taken over his neighborhood. Unwilling to play by the rules set down by the criminals, Silva forgoes the use of guns and decides to battle the thugs with the strength of his fists, spirit and willpower, turning himself into a real-life, modern-day superhero. Packed with pulse pounding, adrenaline-filled action; \"Latin Dragon\" gives us our first mainstream Hispanic martial arts action hero. ==External links== * * * * Category:2004 films Category:2000s action films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American martial arts films ",
