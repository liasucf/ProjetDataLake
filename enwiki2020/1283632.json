In the 1970s and 1980s Makro extended its business to the Americas and Asia. Makro had also expanded to the United States in the mid-1980s. In 1989, Kmart bought the US locations, and converted most of them to Pace Warehouse in 1990. The Asian stores were also eventually sold out to various firms with the latest ones sold to CP ALL of Thailand. In 1998, owner SHV Holdings sold the Makro stores in Europe to Metro AG. Makro stores are not open to the general public (except in Belgium, Brazil, Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand.

In 1968, the first Makro store opened in Amsterdam. In April 1971 the first Makro in the UK opened in Eccles, Manchester.
