    "text": "Constituencies of Madhya Pradesh The history of the Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha constituencies can be traced to 1935, when the Government of India Act 1935 provided for the first elected legislature of the Central Provinces, the Central Provinces Legislative Assembly. The first elections to the Central Provinces Legislative Assembly were held in 1937. After the Indian independence in 1947, the erstwhile province of the Central Provinces and Berar along with a number of princely states merged with the Indian Union, became a new state, Madhya Pradesh. The number of constituencies of the legislative assembly of this state was 184. 127 constituencies were single member and 48 constituencies were double member. 9 constituencies were reserved for the candidates belonging to the Scheduled tribes. The present-day Madhya Pradesh state came into existence on 1 November 1956 following the reorganization of states. It was created by merging the erstwhile Madhya Pradesh (without the Marathi speaking areas, which were merged with Bombay state), Madhya Bharat, Vindhya Pradesh and Bhopal states. The number of constituencies of the legislative assemblies of Madhya Bharat, Vindhya Pradesh and Bhopal were 79, 48 and 23 respectively. On 1 November 1956 the legislative assemblies of all four erstwhile states were also merged to form the reorganized Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha. The tenure of this first Vidhan Sabha was very short, it was dissolved on 5 March 1957. The first election to the re-organized Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha were held in 1957 and the second Vidhan Sabha was constituted on 1 April 1957. Initially, the number of constituencies of the Vidhan Sabha was 288 which was later enhanced to 320, out of which 43 were reserved for the candidates belonging to the Scheduled castes and 75 were reserved for the candidates belonging to the Scheduled tribes. On 1 November 2000, a new state, Chhattisgarh was carved out of Madhya Pradesh state. As a result, the number of constituencies of the Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha was reduced to 230, out of which 34 were reserved for the candidates belonging to the Scheduled castes and 41 were reserved for the candidates belonging to the Scheduled tribes. ==List of constituencies== Following is the list of the constituencies of the Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha since the delimitation of legislative assembly constituencies in 2008. At present, 35 constituencies are reserved for the candidates belonging to the Scheduled castes and 47 are reserved for the candidates belonging to the Scheduled tribes: {|class=\"wikitable sortable\"
