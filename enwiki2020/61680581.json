Thereafter, \"Burma\" Bala and Narmadha's maid Kausi (Madhupriya) fall in love with each other. After a new misunderstanding, Narmadha orders Bala to get out of her house. Her father Ramkumar (Rajesh) then explains to her why Bala worked for them all along despite her insulting remarks. A few years back, Bala was the son of the village chief and dreamt to become a playback singer. He then left his village and came to Chennai, nobody was ready to give him a chance to sing and all his attempts to become a singer failed. Meanwhile, Narmadha who was still studying in college got an opportunity to act as a heroine in a film. First reluctant, she accepts when she needed money for her mother's heart surgery. During the shooting of her first film, Narmadha and her father Ramkumar met Bala, they felt pity for him and decided to help him. Bala stayed in Narmadha's home and before the death of Narmadha's mother, Bala promised her to make her daughter Narmadha a successful actress. Bala and Narmadha eventually fell in love with each. Later, Narmadha's first film got negative reviews during the test screening, so the film's financier planned to kill Narmadha before its release to create publicity thus making it a blockbuster film. Bala who had listened to his conversation tried to save her from the goons. During the fight, Narmadha and Bala got injured in the head but they managed to escape and ended up in a mass marriage ceremony. Ramkumar who was with them agreed for the wedding and they got married. When Bala's father (Rajeev) came to know about the wedding, he gave Bala one of his properties and disowned his son.

To save his daughter's acting career and her mother's dream, Ramkumar begged Bala to not disclose about their wedding at any moment and Bala began to work as her car driver.

Kichas had cranked the camera whereas music was scored by music director Bharani. Speaking about the film, the director said, \"the film has a gripping story of an actress kidnapped by a few anti- socials with the hero stepping in to rescue her\". ==Soundtrack== The film score and the soundtrack were composed by film composer Bharani. The soundtrack features 8 tracks. ==Reception== Balaji Balasubramaniam of bbthots.com wrote, \"the film has an uncharismatic lead pair, weak cast, unreal characters, unbelievable situations, medical blunders, unfunny comedy, cheap item numbers and vulgar duets\". Indiaglitz said, \"Jai Akash looks dull and weak while Pranathy lacks any screen presence. The newcomer Suresh does nothing to impress the audience. Vadivelu's comedy too doesn't work\" and added, \"nothing can save the movie as the director seems to have shot himself in the foot\". P. V. Sathish Kumar of nowrunning.com wrote, \"Radha Bharathi's loosely coupled screenplay and hackneyed narration are responsible for not attracting the audience\". ==References== Category:2005 films Category:Indian films Category:Tamil-language films Category:2000s Tamil-language films Category:2005 romantic drama films Category:Indian romantic drama films Category:Films featuring an item number Category:Films directed by Radha Bharathi Category:2005 drama films ",
