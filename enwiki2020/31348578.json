    "text": "Doodle is a Swiss online calendar tool for time management, and coordinating meetings. It is based in Zurich, Switzerland and has been operational since 2007. It has offices in Berlin, Tel Aviv, and Belgrade. Users are asked to determine the best time and date to meet. The organizer then chooses the time that suits everyone and the meeting is booked in your calendar. Meeting coordinators (administrators) receive e-mail alerts for votes and comments. Registration is required to have this function. In 2014 Swiss media giant Tamedia increased its share in Doodle to 100 percent. Doodle released its Android and iOS apps in 2014. They also passed the 20 million monthly user benchmark. Doodle acquired Meekan in 2016. Meekan is a chatbot developed in Israel. Meekan uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to schedule meetings. Doodle has since begun to integrate this technology into their products. In 2016, Doodle was used by over 180 million unique users in 175 different countries. Alicia Coleman started as new CEO of Doodle in June of 2020, following Gabriele Ottino departure after 3 years as Doodle's CEO. Doodle interacts with various external calendar systems. Google Calendar, Yahoo Calendar, Microsoft Outlook and Apple iCal can be utilized with Doodle to track dates. Google Maps may also be used to share the location of the event. In November 2018, Doodle 1:1 was launched, allowing users to easily schedule one-on-one meetings. Similar popular competing products, which may collectively be designated as \"date matchers\", include Dudle (free software, maintained by the TU Dresden), ScheduleOnce, Tungle (which ceased 3 December 2012), TimeBridge (ceased), WhenIsGood, Framadate (free self-hostable software, with a web version), Xoyondo, and LetsMeetOn. == References == == External links == * Category:Internet properties established in 2007 Category:Meetings Category:Multilingual websites Category:Swiss websites Category:Date-matching software ",
