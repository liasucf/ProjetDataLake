Laevaptychus latus is common throughout the Upper Jurassic and is abundant in the Alpine- Mediterranean region. It is also recorded in southern Arabia, Tunisia, Somalia and the western North Atlantic. In Mexico, the first records of Aptychus latus (= Laevaptychus latus) are provided from the Upper Jurassic of the La Caja Formation at Sierra de Catorce, San Luis Potos\u00ed and from the upper Kimmeridgian \"Couche \u00e0 Haploceras d. gr.
