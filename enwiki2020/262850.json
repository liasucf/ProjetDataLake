He is Chairman of the Department of Transnational Studies at the University of Buffalo. ==Early life and education== Foster was born in Bridgetown, Barbados on 26 September 1954 to Fred and Doris Goddard. When Foster was two years old, his parents migrated to Britain, leaving their children with relatives. The family was extremely poor; Foster remembers a childhood where there was rarely enough to eat. He emigrated to Canada in 1978. Foster completed his PhD at York University in 2001. ==Career== Foster began working for the Caribbean News Agency in Bridgetown as the senior reporter and editor (1975\u201377), and the Barbados Advocate News as the reporter and columnist (1977\u201379), Foster emigrated to Canada in 1979. He went on to work for the Toronto Star as a reporter (1979\u201382). Foster then began working for The Contrast as an editor (1979\u201382), Transportation Business Management as an editor (1982\u201383), The Globe and Mail as a reporter (1983\u201389), The Financial Post as a senior editor (1989), and also served as special adviser to Ontario's Ministry of Culture, through the mid-1990s. His most recent book, Where Race Does Not Matter (2004), explores the potential of multiculturalism in Canada. It also expands on some of his earlier work that deals with issues of race in his own life as well as in the history of Canada. He is well known for exploring race through immigration, and empowers this culture and beliefs through \"Blacks in Action\". Foster continues to bring his own personal experiences, and real-life issues to the work that he continues to produce. Island Wings: A Memoir (1998) was written as an autobiography of his own life, and is often referred to as more informative, rather than entertainment. Foster completed his PhD, a phenomenological exploration of the concept of Blackness in Canada, at York University in 2003. His philosophical influences include Hegel, Marx, Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve, Will Kymlicka, Charles Taylor, and former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.
