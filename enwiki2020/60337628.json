The local authority must have a legal control over the site, by owning or leasing it or having an agreement with the owner. LNRs are sites which have a special local interest either biologically or geologically, and local authorities have a duty to care for them. They can apply local bye-laws to manage and protect LNRs. As of March 2019, there are twenty-seven LNRs in West Sussex. Nine are Sites of Special Scientific Interest, six are Nature Conservation Review sites, four are Ramsar sites, two are Special Areas of Conservation, four are Special Protection Areas, one includes a Scheduled Monument and two are managed by the Sussex Wildlife Trust. West Sussex is in south-east England and it has a population of approximately 780,000. The county town is Chichester. In the north of the county are the heavy clays and sands of the Weald. The chalk of the South Downs runs across the centre from east to west and in the south a coastal plain runs down to the English Channel. ==Key== ===Public access=== *No = no public access to site *PP = public access to part of site *Yes = public access to all or most of the site ===Other classifications=== *NCR = Nature Conservation Review site *Ramsar = Ramsar site, an internationally important wetland site *SAC = Special Area of Conservation *SM = Scheduled monument *SPA = Special Protection Area under the European Union Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds * SSSI = Site of Special Scientific Interest *SWT = Sussex Wildlife Trust ==Sites== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" !scope=\"col\" | Site !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Photograph !scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| Area !scope=\"col\" | Location !scope=\"col\" | Borough !scope=\"col\" | Other classifications !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Map !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Details !scope=\"col\" | Access !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description |- ! scope=\"row\"|Ardingly Reservoir |alt=Ardingly Reservoir | | Haywards Heath |Mid Sussex | | Map | Details |Yes |The reservoir has open water, hay meadow, deciduous woodland, hazel coppice, reedbeds and wetland.
