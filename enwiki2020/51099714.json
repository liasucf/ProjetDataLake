    "text": "The National Police of Honduras (founded 5 January 1888) is the uniformed police force of the Republic of Honduras. The force is organised into regional headquarters, municipal headquarters, headquarters of fixed or mobile stations, and police posts. There are at least 360 police centres throughout Honduras. The National Police of Honduras has its headquarters in Tegucigalpa, the capital city of Honduras. The National Police of Honduras is the fourth largest police body in Central America by number of employees (more than Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Belize). It is the sixth largest force in Central America by police officers per capita. The force's patroness is the Virgin of Carmen. On 16 July of each year the \"National Police Patroness Day\" is celebrated. == History == ===Origins=== In 1866, the ruling general in Honduras, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Medina made the \"Law of Rural Police\". A group of men were given powers similar to those of a Justice of the peace. This group of officers was later called the \"Body of the Gendarmerie\". In December 1881, the president of the republic, Marco Aurelio Soto, instituted the \"Police of the Line\" in Tegucigalpa and Comayag\u00fcela. There was a Commandant, a sub-commander, an assistant, four sergeants, and five policemen. On 15 January 1882, by order of President Marco Aurelio Soto, the National Police of Honduras was established. On 14 September 1888, the acting president, General Luis Bogr\u00e1n, issued a decree that a port police unit be formed. The new unit became operational on 1 January 1890.Los deliberantes, el poder militar en Honduras. In the 1930s, the first National Directorate of Criminal Investigation was formed and in 1933, a division of traffic policing was created. ===Military rule=== In 1957, government and military relations in Honduras began to deteriorate. In June 1959, the National Police of Honduras was replaced by the \"Civil Guard\", a paramilitary force with policing duties. The 1963 Honduran coup d'\u00e9tat led by Colonel Arming Vel\u00e1squez Cerrato and Oswaldo L\u00f3pez Arellano removed President Ram\u00f3n Villeda Morales from power. On 9 October 1963, the Special Security Corps (CES) was formed by Chief of State Arellano. The first director of the CES was General Alonzo Flores Guerra. Rural and highway patrol units were formed. In 1969, during the Football War (conflict between Honduras and El Salvador), the CES fought on the side of the Honduras army. In 1974, a unit for the policing of inland revenue was created. On 30 January 1975, the CES was disbanded and \"FUSEP\", a public security force, was formed as a branch of the military. The officers of FUSEP were outfitted in green uniforms and armed with regulation 9mm Browning Hi-Power pistols and FN FAL (Rifle Automatique L\u00e9ger) 7.62\u00d751mm calibre NATO rifles. ===Return to civil governance=== From 1982, Honduras returned to civil rule and the police force was to be separated from the military. However, at the time, the police force kept some military characteristics. It operated under the auspices of the Office of National Defense and Public Security (SDNSP) and under the authority of the director of the FFAA, who was a representative of the president. There was continuation of a National Directorate of Investigation (DNI). The commander-in-chief, a general, was a graduate of the General Jos\u00e9 Trinidad Caba\u00f1as National Police Academy of Honduras (ANAPO), and sometimes of the National Police University of Honduras (UNPH). On 4 January 1982, the Captain Jos\u00e9 Santos Guardiola Centre for Police Instruction (CIP-CJSG) (the Police Technical Institute (ITP- CJSG)) was established. In July 1984, the School for Qualification of Police Officials (ECOP) (\"Upper Institute of Police Education\" (ISEP)) was established. In 1993, a new division, the Directorate General of Criminal Investigation (DGIC) was created. On 17 December 1996, by Decree Number 229-96, Congress ordered the transfer of the police force to civil control. The governing body was a board chaired by Hern\u00e1n Corrales Padilla. The board members were lawyers Jorge Ponce Turcios, Francisco Cardona Arg\u00fcelles, Germ\u00e1n Leitzelar Vidaurreta, Felipe Elvir Sierra, Jos\u00e9 Zamora Bados, and the engineer, Alfredo Landaverde. On 28 May 1998, by Decree Number 156-98, the \"Organic Law of the National Police\" (LOPN) was created. The governing civil body was the Secretariat of State in the Dispatch of Security. The decree was administered by Hern\u00e1n Corrales Padilla (1924 - 1999). On 22 May 2012, the General Director of the Honduran National Police, Juan Carlos Bonilla Valladares, known as \"El Tigre\" was appointed. On 19 December 2013, Valladares left office, replaced by Ram\u00f3n Antonio Sabill\u00f3n Pineda.El Heraldo (Honduras) (Consultado 9/enero/2014)Martinez O. \"Honduras' Macho Cops\" New York Times 8 March 2014.
