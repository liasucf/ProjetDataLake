As a result, the Bayer Giants went down to Germany's Regional 1 (4th division) to restructure. The license for the Basketball Bundesliga was transferred to D\u00fcsseldorf, who chose to keep the name Giants. The tourism investment of Ozaltin Group, Gloria Hotels & Resorts became the main sponsor of Germany Beko Basketball League\u2019s entrenched team Duesseldorf Giants. The name of the team was changed to \"Gloria Giants\" for the 2010-11 season. They ended on the 17th place in the 2009\u201310 season and relegated from the Bundesliga, but Gloria Hotels & Resorts invested more money in the club to get an immediate return to the first tier with a wild-card. The following season the team relegated again. In 2012 the club name was changed to D\u00fcsseldorf Baskets. After the 2012/2013 season the license of the team for playing in the second tier league in 2013/2014 was revoked by the league. Due to that the team did not take part in any competition in the 2013/2014 season. In March 2014 the team filed for bankruptcy.https://www.derwesten.de/sport/lokalsport/duesseldorf/aus-fuer-die- duesseldorf-baskets-didin-meldet-insolvenz-an-id9138971.html ==Names== *2008\u20132010: D\u00fcsseldorf Giants *2010\u20132012: Gloria Giants D\u00fcsseldorf *2012\u20132014: D\u00fcsseldorf Baskets ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%\" !Season !Tier !League !Pos. !Postseason |- |style=\"background:#efefef;\"| 2008\u201309 | align=\"center\"|1 | BBL | align=\"center\" style=\"background: \" | 12 | style=\"background: \" | \u2013 |- |style=\"background:#efefef;\"| 2009\u201310 | align=\"center\"|1 | BBL | align=\"center\" style=\"background:\" | 17 | style=\"background:#ffcccc\" | RelegatedClub received a wild-card to avoid relegation. |- |style=\"background:#efefef;\"| 2010\u201311 | align=\"center\"|1 | BBL | align=\"center\" style=\"background: ;\" | 18 | style=\"background:#ffcccc\" | Relegated |- |style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2011\u201312 | align=\"center\"|2 | Pro A | align=\"center\" style=\"background: ;\" | 6 | style=\"background:#ACE1AF\" | Semifinalist |- |style=\"background:#efefef;\"|2012\u201313 | align=\"center\"|2 | Pro A | align=\"center\"| 3 | style=\"background:silver\" | Runner-up |- |} ==Logos== Giants_DUS.jpg |Gloria Giants D\u00fcsseldorf ==References== ==External links== *Team profile at eurobasket.com *Official website Category:Basketball clubs in North Rhine-Westphalia Category:Basketball teams established in 2008 Category:Basketball teams disestablished in 2014 Category:Basketball teams in Germany Category:2008 establishments in Germany Category:2014 disestablishments in Germany Category:Sport in D\u00fcsseldorf ",
