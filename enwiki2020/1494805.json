    "text": "The Odes () are a collection in four books of Latin lyric poems by Horace. The Horatian ode format and style has been emulated since by other poets. Books 1 to 3 were published in 23 BC. A fourth book, consisting of 15 poems, was published in 13 BC. The Odes were developed as a conscious imitation of the short lyric poetry of Greek originals \u2013 Pindar, Sappho and Alcaeus are some of Horace's models. His genius lay in applying these older forms to the social life of Rome in the age of Augustus. The Odes cover a range of subjects \u2013 Love, Friendship, Wine, Religion, Morality, Patriotism; poems of eulogy addressed to Augustus and his relations; and verses written on a miscellany of subjects and incidents, including the uncertainty of life, the cultivation of tranquility and contentment, and the observance of moderation or the \"golden mean.\"For a discussion of the classification of Horace's Odes, see The Works of Horace Rendered into English Prose by James Lonsdale, M.A. and Samuel Lee, M.A. London: Macmillan and Co., 1883, p. 22 and Horace: The Complete Works by Charles E. Bennett and John Carew Rolfe. Boston: Allyn & Bacon, 1901, pp. xvii-xxii. The Odes have been considered traditionally by English-speaking scholars as purely literary works. Recent evidence by a Horatian scholar suggests they may have been intended as performance art, a Latin re- interpretation of Greek lyric song. The Roman writer Petronius, writing less than a century after Horace's death, remarked on the curiosa felicitas (studied spontaneity) of the Odes (Satyricon 118). The English poet Alfred Lord Tennyson declared that the Odes provided \"jewels five-words long, that on the stretched forefinger of all Time / Sparkle for ever\" (The Princess, part II, l.355). ==Book 1== Book 1 consists of 38 poems.All Latin text courtesy of thelatinlibrary.comSummaries are taken from: * The Works of Horace Rendered into English Prose by James Lonsdale, M.A. and Samuel Lee, M.A. London: Macmillan and Co., 1883; * Horace: The Complete Works by Charles E.

I.1, Maecenas atavis edite regibus... \u2013 Dedication of the First Three Books of the Odes to Maecenas (Horace's Patron) \u2013 Every man is governed by his ruling passion: the Olympian charioteer, the politician, the trader, the husbandman, the merchant, the man of pleasure, the soldier, and the hunter. To win the title of a lyric poet is all that Horace desires. I.2, Iam satis terris nivis atque dirae... \u2013 To Augustus, The Deliverer and Hope of the State \u2013 The subject of this ode is the overflowing of the Tiber, which recalls to the poet the flood of Deucalion.

Augustus, as Mercury in human shape, is invoked to save the empire. I.3, Sic te diva potens Cypri.. \u2013 To Virgil, Setting Out for Greece \u2013 The ode begins with a prayer for the safe voyage of Virgil to Athens, which suggests the daring of the earliest mariners and the boldness of men in overcoming difficulties set by Nature.

I.10, Mercuri, facunde nepos Atlantis... \u2013 Hymn to Mercury \u2013 Mercury is addressed as the god of eloquence and the promoter of the civilization of man; as the messenger of the gods and the inventor of the lyre; skilled in craft and cunning; and the conductor of souls to the Underworld. I.11, Tu ne quaesieris... \u2013 Carpe Diem! \u2013 The poet seeks to dissuade Leuconoe from giving heed to the false arts of astrologers and diviners.

I.14, O navis, referent in mare te novi fluctus... \u2013 The Ship of State \u2013 Horace refers to a period during which the Roman state was tossed and nearly wrecked by perpetual storms. He exhorts it to beware of fresh perils and keep safely in harbor. I.15, Pastor cum traheret... \u2013 The Prophecy of Nereus \u2013 As Paris hurries from Sparta to Troy with Helen, Nereus stills the winds and prophesies \u2013 Ilium's doom is inevitable. I.16, O matre pulchra filia pulchrior... \u2013 An Apology \u2013 The poet has offended some lady by the intemperate utterances of his verse; he now seeks forgiveness for the fault.

I.17, Velox amoenum saepe Lucretilem... \u2013 An Invitation to Tyndaris to Enjoy the Delights of the Country \u2013 Horace invites Tyndaris to his Sabine farm, and describes the air of tranquility and security there, blessed as it is with favoring protection of Faunus and the rural deities.

I.34, Parcus deorum cultor et infrequens... \u2013 The Poet's Conversion from Error \u2013 After hearing thunder in a cloudless sky, Horace renounces his former error and declares his belief in Jupiter, Fortuna, and the superintending providence of the gods. I.35, O diva, gratum quae regis Antium... \u2013 Hymn to Fortuna \u2013 The poet invokes Fortune as an all-powerful goddess.

II.1, Motum ex Metello consule civicum... \u2013 To Asinius Pollio, the writer of tragedy, who is now composing a history of the civil wars. A lament for the carnage caused by the conflicts of the Romans with their fellow-citizens. II.2, Nullus argento color est avaris... \u2013 The Wise Use of Money \u2013 To Sallustius Crispus (nephew of the historian Sallust). The love of gain grows by self-indulgence. The moderate man is the genuine king. II.3, Aequam memento rebus in arduis... \u2013 The Wisdom of Moderation, The Certainty of Death \u2013 To Quintus Dellius. Let us enjoy our life while we may, for death will soon strip us all alike of our possessions. II.4, Ne sit ancillae tibi amor pudori... \u2013 To Xanthias Phoceus \u2013 Horace encourages his friend on his love for Phyllis, his slave. II.5, Nondum subacta ferre iugum valet... \u2013 Not Yet! \u2013 To a Friend on His Love for Lalage \u2013 The maid his friend loves is not yet marriageable and still too young to return his passion \u2013 Soon it will be otherwise. II.6, Septimi, Gadis aditure mecum et... \u2013 Fairest of All is Tibur \u2013 Yet Tarentum, Too, Is Fair \u2013 To Horace's friend, the Roman knight Septimius, who would go with him to the ends of the earth.

II.9, Non semper imbres nubibus hispidos... \u2013 A Truce to Sorrow, Valgius! \u2013 To C. Valgius Rufus on the death of his son Mystes. Since all troubles have their natural end, do not mourn overmuch. Rather let us celebrate the latest victories of Augustus. II.10, Rectius vives, Licini, neque altum... \u2013 The Golden Mean \u2013 To L. Licinius Murena. The moderate life is the perfect life. II.11, Quid bellicosus Cantaber et Scythes... \u2013 Enjoy Life Wisely! \u2013 Horace in a half-playful tone advises his friend Quinctius Hirpinus to enjoy life wisely, and not to fret. II.12, Nolis longa ferae bella Numantiae... \u2013 The Charms of Licymnia \u2013 Horace pleads the unfitness of his lyric poetry to record the wars of the Romans or the battles of mythology. He advises Maecenas to write in prose the history of Caesar's campaigns, while he himself will sing the praises of Licymnia (some commentators say that Licymnia was another name for Terentia, the wife of Maecenas). II.13, Ille et nefasto te posuit die... \u2013 A Narrow Escape \u2013 This ode owes its origin to Horace's narrow escape from sudden death by the falling of a tree on his Sabine estate. (This same event is also alluded to in Odes, II.17 line 28 and III.4 line 27.) After expressing his indignation against the person who planted the tree, he passes to a general reflection on the uncertainty of life and the realms of dark Proserpine. II.14, Eheu fugaces, Postume... \u2013 Death Inevitable \u2013 Addressed to Postumus, a rich but avaricious friend. Nothing can stay the advance of decay and death, the common doom of all on earth. Men pile up wealth, only for another to waste it. II.15, Iam pauca aratro iugera regiae... \u2013 Against Luxury \u2013 Horace describes the extravagant luxury prevalent among the rich, and praises the simplicity and frugality of the old Romans. II.16, Otium divos rogat in patenti... \u2013 Contentment With Our Lot the Only True Happiness \u2013 All men long for repose, which riches cannot buy. Contentment, not wealth, makes genuine happiness. II.17, Cur me querellis exanimas tuis?... \u2013 To Maecenas on His Recovery from Illness \u2013 Horace says that the same day must of necessity bring death to them both \u2013 Their horoscopes are wonderfully alike and they have both been saved from extreme peril. II.18, Non ebur neque aureum... \u2013 The Vanity of Riches \u2013 The poet, content with his own moderate fortune, inveighs against the blindness of avarice \u2013 for the same end awaits all men. II.19, Bacchum in remotis carmina rupibus... \u2013 Hymn to Bacchus \u2013 The poet celebrates Bacchus as all-powerful, all-conquering, and lord of creation; whom the earth, the sea and all nature obey; to whom men are subject, and the giants and the monsters of Orcus are all brought low. II.20, Non usitata nec tenui ferar... \u2013 The Poet Prophesies His Own Immortality \u2013 Transformed into a swan, the poet will soar away from the abodes of men, nor will he need the empty honors of a tomb. ==Book 3== \"Justum et tenacem propositi virum\" \u2013 \"a man just and steadfast in purpose\", from Horace's Odes, III.3, on the gravestone of Elliot Charles Bovill, Chief Justice of the Straits Settlements, in Fort Canning Green, Singapore The ancient editor Porphyrion read the first six odes of this book as a single sequence, one unified by a common moral purpose and addressed to all patriotic citizens of Rome. These six \"Roman odes\", as they have since been called (by HT Pl\u00fcss in 1882), share a common meter and take as a common theme the glorification of Roman virtues and the attendant glory of Rome under Augustus. Ode III.2 contains the famous line \"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori,\" (It is sweet and honorable to die for one's country). Ode III.5 Caelo tonantem credidimus Jovem makes explicit identification of Augustus as a new Jove destined to restore in modern Rome the valor of past Roman heroes like Marcus Atilius Regulus, whose story occupies the second half of the poem. Book 3 consists of 30 poems. III.1, Odi profanum vulgus et arceo... \u2013 On Happiness \u2013 Philosophy is a mystery which the uninitiated crowd cannot understand. The worthlessness of riches and rank. The praise of contentment. Care cannot be banished by change of scene. III.2, Angustam amice pauperiem pati... \u2013 On Virtue \u2013 Horace extols the virtue of endurance and valor in fighting for one's country, of integrity in politics, and of religious honor. III.3, Iustum et tenacem propositi virum... \u2013 On Integrity and Perseverance \u2013 The merit of integrity and resolution: the examples of Pollux, Hercules and Romulus. Juno's speech to the gods on the destiny of Rome. III.4, Descende caelo et dic age tibia... \u2013 On Wise Counsel and Clemency \u2013 The Muses have guarded and given counsel to Horace since his youth. They also do so to Augustus, and prompt him to clemency and kindness. The evils of violence and arrogance, on the other hand, are exemplified by the Titans and Giants, and others. III.5, Caelo tonantem credidimus Iovem... \u2013 To Augustus \u2013 On Virtue and Fortitude \u2013 Augustus will be recognized as a god on earth for his subjugation of the Britons and Parthians. The disgraceful actions of the troops of Crassus (who married Parthians after being taken prisoner) are contrasted by the noble example of Regulus (who was released from Carthage to negotiate a peace, but dissuaded the Senate, and then returned to Carthage to be tortured to death). III.6, Delicta maiorum inmeritus lues... \u2013 Piety & Chastity \u2013 Return to the Old Morals! \u2013 Horace condemns the prevailing domestic immorality and contempt of the institutions of religion, and earnestly urges a speedy return to the simpler and purer manners of ancient times. III.7, Quid fles, Asterie, quem tibi candidi... \u2013 Constancy, Asterie! \u2013 Horace consoles Asterie on the absence of her lover Gyges, and warns her not to be unfaithful to her own vows. III.8, Martis caelebs quid agam Kalendis... \u2013 A Happy Anniversary \u2013 Horace invites Maecenas to celebrate with him the festival of the Calends of March (the Feast of the Matrons), which was also the anniversary of his narrow escape from sudden death by a falling tree. III.9, Donec gratus eram tibi... \u2013 The Reconciliation of Two Lovers \u2013 Often referred to as an \"Amoebaean\" ode (from the Greek \u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03b2\u03c9 \u2013 to exchange), it describes, in graceful dialogue, a quarrel between two lovers and their reconciliation. III.10, Extremum Tanain si biberes, Lyce... \u2013 A Lover's Complaint \u2013 Horace warns Lyce that he cannot put up with her unkindness forever. III.11, Mercuri, \u2013 nam te docilis magistro... \u2013 Take Warning, Lyde, from the Danaids! \u2013 To Mercury \u2013 Horace begs the god to teach him such melody as will overcome the unkindness of Lyde. The ode concludes with the tale of the daughters of Danaus, and their doom in the underworld. III.12, Miserarum est neque amori dare ludum... \u2013 Unhappy Neobule \u2013 Joyless is the life of Neobule, ever under the watchful eye of a strict guardian. Only thoughts of handsome Hebrus take her mind off her troubles. III.13, O fons Bandusiae splendidior vitro... \u2013 O, Fountain of Bandusia! \u2013 Tomorrow a sacrifice will be offered to the fountain of Bandusia, whose refreshing coolness is offered to the flocks and herds, and which is now immortalized in verse. III.14, Herculis ritu modo dictus, o plebs... \u2013 The Return of Augustus \u2013 Horace proclaims a festal day on the return of Augustus from Spain (c. 24 BC), where he had reduced to subjection the fierce Cantabri. III.15, Uxor pauperis Ibyci... \u2013 Chloris, Act Your Age! \u2013 Horace taunts Chloris with her attempts to appear young, and with her frivolous life, while she is really an old woman. III.16, Inclusam Danaen turris aenea... \u2013 Contentment is Genuine Wealth \u2013 Gold is all-powerful, but its possession brings care and restlessness. True contentment is to be satisfied with little, as Horace is with his Sabine farm. III.17, Aeli vetusto nobilis ab Lamo... \u2013 Prepare for Storms Tomorrow \u2013 To Aelius Lamia \u2013 The crow foretells a stormy day tomorrow \u2013 Gather some firewood while you may, and spend the day in festivity. III.18, Faune, Nympharum fugientum amator... \u2013 Hymn to Faunus \u2013 Horace asks Faunus to bless his flocks and fields, for when Faunus is near, the whole countryside is glad. III.19, Quantum distet ab Inacho... \u2013 Invitation to a Banquet \u2013 Horace invites Telephus to give up for a time his historical researches, and join him at a banquet in honor of Murena. III.20, Non vides quanto moveas periclo... \u2013 The Rivals \u2013 Horace humorously describes a contest between Pyrrhus and some maiden for the exclusive regards of Nearchus. III.21, O nata mecum consule Manlio... \u2013 To a Wine-Jar \u2013 Horace, preparing to entertain his friend the orator M. Valerius Messala Corvinus, sings of the manifold virtues of wine. III.22, Montium custos nemorumque virgo \u2013 To Diana \u2013 Horace dedicates a pine tree to Diana, and vows to the goddess a yearly sacrifice. III.23, Caelo supinas si tuleris manus \u2013 Humble Sacrifices Devoutly Offered \u2013 Horace assures the rustic Phidyle that the favor of the gods is gained not by costly offerings, but simple sacrifices such as salted meal offered with true feeling. III.24, Intactis opulentior... \u2013 The Curse of Mammon \u2013 Boundless riches cannot banish fear or avert death. A simple life like that of the Scythians is the healthiest and best. Stringent laws are needed to curb the present luxury and licentiousness. III.25, Quo me, Bacche, rapis tui... \u2013 To Bacchus in Honor of Augustus \u2013 Horace fancies himself carried along by Bacchus amid woods and wilds to celebrate, in some distant cave, the praises of Augustus. III.26, Vixi puellis nuper idoneus... \u2013 Love's Triumphs Are Ended \u2013 Scorned by the haughty Chloe, the poet, like a discharged soldier, abandons the arms of love. But he begs of Venus, as a last request, that his slighted love may not go unavenged. III.27, Impios parrae recinentis omen... \u2013 Galatea, Beware! \u2013 Addressed to Galatea, whom the poet seeks to dissuade from the voyage she intended to make during the stormy season of the year. He bids her to beware, lest the mild aspect of the deceitful skies lead her astray \u2013 for it was through lack of caution that Europa was carried away across the sea. III.28, Festo quid potius die... \u2013 In Neptune's Honor \u2013 An invitation to Lyde to visit the poet on the festival of Neptune, and join him in wine and song. III.29, Tyrrhena regum progenies, tibi... \u2013 Invitation to Maecenas \u2013 Horace invites Maecenas to leave the smoke and wealth and bustle of Rome, and come to visit him on his Sabine farm. He bids him to remember that we must live wisely and well in the present, as the future is uncertain. III.30, Exegi monumentum aere perennius... \u2013 The Poet's Immortal Fame \u2013 In this closing poem, Horace confidently predicts his enduring fame as the first and greatest of the lyric poets of Rome. He asserts: Exegi monumentum aere perennius (I have raised a monument more permanent than bronze). ==Book 4== Horace published a fourth book of Odes in 13 BC consisting of 15 poems. Horace acknowledged the gap in time with the first words of the opening poem of the collection: Intermissa, Venus, diu / rursus bella moves (Venus, you return to battles long interrupted). IV.1, Intermissa, Venus, diu... \u2013 Venus, Forbear! \u2013 Horace complains that in advancing age he is vexed with new desires by the cruel goddess of love: he pines for Ligurinus. He bids her to turn to a more youthful and worthy subject, his friend Paulus Maximus. IV.2, Pindarum quisquis studet aemulari... \u2013 Not for Me to Sing of Augustus! \u2013 Horace was asked by Iulus Antonius (the son of Marc Antony and stepson of Augustus' sister Octavia) to sing of Augustus' victories in a Pindaric ode. Horace declines, alleging lack of talent, and requests Iulus to compose the poem himself. IV.3, Quem tu, Melpomene, semel... \u2013 To Melpomene, Muse of Lyric Poetry \u2013 To the Muse Melpomene Horace ascribes his poetic inspiration and the honors which he enjoys as the lyric poet of Rome. IV.4, Qualem ministrum fulminis alitem... \u2013 In Praise of Drusus, the Younger Stepson of Augustus \u2013 (A companion to Ode IV.14, which praises Tiberius). This ode praises Drusus, the younger son of the Empress Livia, on his victory over the Raeti and Vindelici. Drusus is compared to a young eagle and lion. His stepfather Augustus is also praised as having trained him to greatness. IV.5, Divis orte bonis, optume Romulae... \u2013 Augustus, Return! \u2013 Horace begs Augustus to return to Rome, and describes the peace and good order of the principate under his reign. IV.6, Dive, quem proles Niobea magnae... \u2013 Invocation to Apollo \u2013 In the year 17 BC, Augustus commissioned Horace to write the Carmen Saeculare, a hymn to be sung at the Saecular festival. This ode is an invocation to Apollo, begging help and inspiration for this important task. IV.7, Diffugere nives, redeunt iam... \u2013 The Lesson of Spring's Return \u2013 An ode on the same springtime theme as I.4 \u2013 Addressed to his friend Torquatus. Though the earth renews itself, and the waning moon waxes afresh, yet death is the ending of human life. Let us then make the best of our days while they last. IV.8, Donarem pateras grataque commodus... \u2013 In Praise of Poetry \u2013 This ode was written to C. Marcius Censorinus and probably sent as a Saturnalian gift. Horace would give bronze vases, or tripods, or gems of Grecian art, but he does not have these. What he has to give instead is the immortality of a poem. IV.9, Ne forte credas interitura quae... \u2013 In Praise of Lollius \u2013 As in IV.8, Horace promises immortality through his verses, this time to Lollius, a man of wisdom and integrity. IV.10, O crudelis adhuc et Veneris... \u2013 Beauty Is Fleeting \u2013 An ode to a beautiful boy, Ligurinus, and the inevitability of old age. IV.11, Est mihi nonum superantis annum... \u2013 A Joyous Birthday \u2013 An invitation to Phyllis to celebrate the birthday of Maecenas at Horace's Sabine farm. IV.12, Iam veris comites... \u2013 The Delights of Spring \u2013 Addressed to Virgil (although not necessarily the poet). The breezes and birds have returned \u2013 An invitation to a feast of Spring \u2013 The poet agrees to supply the wine, if Virgil will bring a box of perfumes. IV.13, Audivere, Lyce, di mea vota... \u2013 Retribution \u2013 Horace taunts Lyce, now growing old, on her desperate attempts to seem young and fascinating. IV.14, Quae cura patrum quaeve Quiritium... \u2013 In Praise of Tiberius, the Elder Stepson of Augustus \u2013 (A companion to Ode IV.4, which praises Drusus.)
