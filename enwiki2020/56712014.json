    "text": "Scott Westgarth (10 July 1986 \u2013 26 February 2018) was a British light heavyweight boxer. He died on 26 February 2018 at the age of 31 after sustaining injuries following a victory in a 10-round light heavyweight bout during a Saturday night clash. Westgarth's final fight was widely considered to be the biggest victory of his career. == Career == Westgarth boxed 10 matches in his professional career, ending with 7 victories, only 2 losses and a draw before his death. He fought in his final bout on 24 February 2018 against Dec Spelman. This was a 10-round light heavyweight eliminator in Doncaster. He defeated Spelman in the elimination match on points and was looking to try to win the English national championship. == Death == During the final round of the fight against Spelman, Westgarth was knocked down, but was able to recover to ultimately win on points. He went on to conduct a post- match interview before consulting doctors in the dressing room. They sent him to Royal Hallamshire Hospital in an ambulance after concerns for his well- being. During the interview Westgarth held his wrapped hand to his head above his left eye a number of times, suggesting he was in some discomfort. Westgarth died the next day, 25 February 2018. Westgarth was a registered organ donor, and as a result, his organs were used to save the lives of seven people. == See also == *List of deaths due to injuries sustained in boxing == References == Category:1986 births Category:2018 deaths Category:English male boxers Category:Light-heavyweight boxers Category:Deaths due to injuries sustained in boxing Category:Sport deaths in England Category:People from Hexham Category:People from Northumberland Category:Organ transplant donors ",
