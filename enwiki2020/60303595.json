    "text": "Jason Joseph Corso is a professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan and Co-Founder / CEO of the computer vision startup Voxel51. == Education== Corso received his PhD and MSE degrees in Computer Science at The Johns Hopkins University in 2005 and 2002, respectively, and the BS Degree with honors from Loyola College, Maryland, in 2000. He spent two years as a post-doctoral fellow at the University of California, Los Angeles. ==Career== From 2007 to 2014, Corso was a member of the Computer Science and Engineering faculty at SUNY-Buffalo. He is the recipient of a University of Michigan EECS Outstanding Achievement Award 2018, Google Faculty Research Award 2015, the Army Research Office Young Investigator Award 2010, NSF CAREER award 2009, SUNY Buffalo Young Investigator Award 2011, a member of the 2009 DARPA Computer Science Study Group, and a recipient of the Link Foundation Fellowship in Advanced Simulation and Training 2003. He is a member of the AAAI, ACM, MAA and a senior member of the IEEE. Corso is affiliated to Michigan Robotics and the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the University of Michigan. In 2016, Corso co-founded a computer vision startup in Ann Arbor called Voxel51. === Research=== Corso focuses on cognitive computer vision and its entanglement with language, physical constraints, robotics, autonomy, and the semantics of the natural world, both in corner-cases and at scale. He primarily focuses on problems in video understanding such as video segmentation, activity recognition, and video-to-text. == Awards == *EECS Outstanding Achievement Award 2018 from University of Michigan, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science *Best Associate Editor Award for ICRA 2016 *Google Faculty Research Award 2015 *SUNY at Buffalo Young Investigator Award 2011 *Army Research Office Young Investigator Award 2010 *National Science Foundation CAREER Award 2009 == Publications== *Action Bank: A high-level representation of activity in video.
