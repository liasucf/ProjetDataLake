    "text": "In algebra, a generalized Cohen\u2013Macaulay ring is a commutative Noetherian local ring (A, \\mathfrak{m}) of Krull dimension d > 0 that satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions: *For each integer i = 0, \\dots, d - 1, the length of the i-th local cohomology of A is finite: *:\\operatorname{length}_A(\\operatorname{H}^i_{\\mathfrak{m}}(A)) < \\infty. *\\sup_Q (\\operatorname{length}_A(A/Q) - e(Q)) < \\infty where the sup is over all parameter ideals Q and e(Q) is the multiplicity of Q. *There is an \\mathfrak{m}-primary ideal Q such that for each system of parameters x_1, \\dots, x_d in Q, (x_1, \\dots, x_{d-1}) : x_d = (x_1, \\dots, x_{d-1}) : Q. *For each prime ideal \\mathfrak{p} of \\widehat{A} that is not \\mathfrak{m} \\widehat{A}, \\dim \\widehat{A}_{\\mathfrak{p}} + \\dim \\widehat{A}/\\mathfrak{p} = d and \\widehat{A}_{\\mathfrak{p}} is Cohen\u2013Macaulay. The last condition implies that the localization A_\\mathfrak{p} is Cohen\u2013Macaulay for each prime ideal \\mathfrak{p} e \\mathfrak{m}. A standard example is the local ring at the vertex of an affine cone over a smooth projective variety. Historically, the notion grew up out of the study of a Buchsbaum ring, a Noetherian local ring A in which \\operatorname{length}_A(A/Q) - e(Q) is constant for \\mathfrak{m}-primary ideals Q; see the introduction of . == References == *Herrmann, M., S.
