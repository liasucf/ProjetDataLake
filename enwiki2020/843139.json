A ( inch) gold star indicates a second or subsequent decoration, while a ( inch) silver star is worn in lieu of five ( inch) gold stars. A ( inch) silver star is not to be confused with representing a Silver Star Medal (Silver Star). == inch star usage == inch stars are worn on a medal suspension and service ribbon with one point of the star pointing up. Up to five stars can be worn on a ribbon. There are no higher degrees of inch stars authorized after five silver inch stars. On miniature medals, a special inch star is worn on the medal's suspension ribbon in lieu of a inch star.Secretary of the Navy Instruction (SECNAVINST) 1650.1H, dated 22 August 2006, Subject: Navy and Marine Corps Awards Manual, paragraph 123. If the number of authorized inch stars exceeds five, a second service ribbon is worn after the first service ribbon. The second service ribbon counts as one additional personal award, after which more stars may be added to the second ribbon. If future awards reduce the number of stars worn on the first ribbon due to gold inch stars being replaced by a silver inch star, the second service ribbon is removed and the appropriate number of star devices are placed on the first service ribbon. When bronze or gold stars or bronze oak leaf cluster attachments are worn in addition to a silver star or silver oak leaf attachment, the bronze or gold stars (bronze oak leaf clusters) are arranged symmetrically on the ribbon in relation to the centered silver device. For example: The first star (cluster) to the wearer's right of the centered silver device; the second to the wearer's left, etc.United States Navy Uniform Regulations Manual, art. 5316.2.d. === Examples === The following are examples of the first through twenty-sixth awards of a Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal with the gold and silver inch stars: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | First award || border |- | Second award || border |- | Third award || border |- | Fourth award || border |- | Fifth award || border |- | Sixth award || border |- | Seventh award || border |- | Eighth award || border |- | Ninth award || border |- | Tenth award || |- | Eleventh award || border |- | Twelfth award || border |- | Thirteenth award || border |- | Fourteenth award || |- | Fifteenth award || |- | Sixteenth award || border |- | Seventeenth award || |- | Eighteenth award || |- | Nineteenth award || |- | Twentieth award || |- | Twenty-first award || border |- | Twenty-second award || |- | Twenty-third award || |- | Twenty-fourth award || |- | Twenty-fifth award || |- | Twenty- sixth award || |} == Authorized decorations == inch stars are authorized for wear on the following United States Navy, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration decorations ( inch stars are not authorized for wear on non-decorations) when a subsequent decoration is awarded to members of the seven uniformed services: the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
