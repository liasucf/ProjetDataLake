    "text": "John Martin (1882 \u2013 after 1911) was an English professional footballer who scored 57 goals from 120 appearances in the Football League playing as a centre forward for Lincoln City and Blackburn Rovers. Martin was born in South Shields, and played for his home-town club before moving into the Football League with Lincoln City. He made his debut on 3 September 1904 in a 2\u20130 win away to Doncaster Rovers in the Second Division. In the following season, Martin was the club's leading scorer, with 20 goals from League and FA Cup games. This earned him a transfer to the First Division with Blackburn Rovers. In his first season, he was Blackburn's leading scorer with 17 League goals from 36 games, but a poorer return the next season left the player \"unhappy with himself and the 'Rovers'\", and he moved to Brighton & Hove Albion, where he scored 18 goals from 37 Southern League appearances. He then played for Millwall Athletic, where he led the Lions in scoring in the 1909\u201310 and 1910\u201311 seasons, before returning to the north-east to spend the 1911\u201312 season with Hartlepools United in the North Eastern League. ==References== Category:1882 births Category:Year of death missing Category:Sportspeople from South Shields Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Kingston Villa F.C. players Category:South Shields F.C.
