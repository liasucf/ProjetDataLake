    "text": "\"The Irish Roar\" is a song released in May 2016 as the official anthem of the Republic of Ireland national soccer team for the 2016 European Championships, held in France. The song was performed by trad-pop group Seo Linn. They were commissioned to write the song after meeting FAI Chief Executive John Delaney on Easter Monday 2016. The song incorporates lyrics from the traditional song \"\u00d3r\u00f3 s\u00e9 do bheatha abhaile.\" ==Reception== RT\u00c9's John Byrne complimented \"The Irish Roar\", calling it \"a bit of a belter.\" However, Robert McNamara of The Irish Examiner called it \"a bit of a bland effort set to dance beat with a bit of ceil\u00ed and qualifying commentary lumped in for good measure. Uninspiring.\" ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart !Peak Position |- |} ==References == ==External links== *\"The Irish Roar\" on Soundcloud Category:2016 singles Category:Republic of Ireland national football team songs Category:Republic of Ireland at UEFA Euro 2016 Category:Football songs and chants Category:2016 songs ",
