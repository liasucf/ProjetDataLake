Allegations of racism were due to the requirement for the user to declare their ethnicity, and the ability to filter non-white users. However, Bradford said people wanted to know about a person's race, and the ethnicity data is meant to help the site be more inclusive by being diverse. According to founders of dating apps, including The League, this is because modern dating app algorithms downrank people when left-swiped (passed on), and uprank when right-swiped (approved). > \"We did a ton of testing on this screen and these preferences were the most > highly requested,\" she said ... while users can select a preference for the > race of partners they'd like to meet, it's not a hard filter. The League > shows each user five potential matches each day, and if a user has set his > preferences too narrowly, he may be shown matches that don't conform to > them, racially or otherwise. ... Bradford insists that the League's policies > are meant to make the service more egalitarian, not less -- at least when it > comes to race. \"The ethnicity data helps us maintain a diverse and balanced > community that reflects that of the city (in our case, the San Francisco Bay > Area),\" she says. ==See also== * Online dating service * Tinder (app) == References == Category:Computer-related introductions in 2015 Category:Mobile social software Category:Geosocial networking Category:Online dating services of the United States Category:IOS software Category:Android (operating system) software ",
