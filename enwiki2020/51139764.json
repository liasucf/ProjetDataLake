In 1966, he was elected to the 4th Essex district seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives on a platform of delivering efficient constituent services and lowering the cost of government. During his tenure in the House, Bussone fought to keep the Beverly Depot commuter rail station open and to open a Registry of Motor Vehicles division in Beverly. He was strongly pro-life and held moderate views on civil and women's rights. Bussone was defeated for reelection in 1974 by Democrat Kevin M. Burke.
