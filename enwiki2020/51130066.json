Most typical are his interior scenes but he also painted a number of scenes of vendors selling their wares. Characteristic of his works are the sharply delineated figures.Tavern Scene at the National Inventory of Continental European Paintings His genre scenes are regarded as promoting bourgeois virtues. Continuing in the steps of his father he recreated the atmosphere of his age in a multitude of small paintings that are pleasantly animated and have an old-fashioned charm. He also signed in the same way as his father, but his style was more distinguished and sensitive. His lighter palette earned him the nickname 'le clair'. ==References== == External links == * Category:1714 births Category:1792 deaths Category:Flemish genre painters Category:Flemish portrait painters Category:18th-century Flemish painters Category:18th-century painters from the Southern Netherlands Category:People from Antwerp Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke ",
