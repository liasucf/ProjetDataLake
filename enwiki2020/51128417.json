He then reached the final of the 2008 WDF Europe Cup, beating Stig Jorgensen in the quarter finals and then beat Fabian Roosenbrand 4\u20130 in the semi-finals before losing to defending champion Mark Webster 4\u20130 in the final. Gurney qualified for the 2009 BDO World Championships, beating former World Masters finalist Jarkko Komula before defeating Belgium's Kim Huybrechts to become the first Northern Irish player to qualify for Lakeside since Mitchell Crooks in 2001. He defeated 14th seed Garry Thompson in the first round to set up a second round encounter with 2007 champion and reigning Masters champion Martin Adams. Gurney put up a brave fight, levelling the match at one set all and then two sets all before Adams' experience paid off as he took the next two sets for a 4\u20132 win. The following year, Gurney qualified again, and once more played the 14th seed in the first round, this time the debuting Scott Mitchell. Gurney won the first two sets before Mitchell levelled the match and took a 2\u20130 lead in the decider, hitting nine out of twelve darts at double. But Gurney eventually prevailed 4\u20132 with consistent scoring. He once again played Adams in the second round, and once again was defeated. Adams went on to win the title. In June 2012, Gurney won the England Masters, Northern Ireland Open and the Tom Kirby Memorial Trophy. In winning the latter he earned a spot in the preliminary round of the 2013 PDC World Championship, where he edged out Robert Marijanovi\u0107 4\u20133 in legs. Gurney then beat Andy Smith 3\u20131 in sets in the first round. He lost each of the first three sets in a deciding leg in the second round against Dave Chisnall and outscored him in the 180 count, but was beaten 4\u20131. In January 2013, Gurney entered Q School in an attempt to win a two-year PDC tour card and was successful on the second day by winning six matches, concluding with a 6\u20132 victory over Paul Amos. His best result in his debut year on the tour came at the German Darts Championship, where Gurney defeated Colin Lloyd, Ronnie Baxter and Simon Whitlock in reaching the quarter-finals, but his run came to an end when he lost 6\u20132 against Peter Wright. ===2014=== Gurney's second quarter-final appearance in the PDC was at a UK Open Qualifier in February 2014 which he reached by eliminating world number one Michael van Gerwen 6\u20135 with a 146 checkout. He was beaten 6\u20134 by Andrew Gilding but the performance ensured he qualified for the UK Open itself for the first time and lost 5\u20134 to Ian White in the second round. Later in the year, Gurney made his debut in the World Grand Prix which he qualified for by being the second highest non-exempt Irish player on the Pro Tour Order of Merit. He came agonosingly close to recording an upset in the first round against Adrian Lewis as in the deciding leg of the final set he missed the bull for a 170 finish and two further darts at double eight to be beaten 3\u20132 in sets. However, he bounced back later in the week when he won the Tom Kirby Memorial Irish Matchplay title by defeating Radek Szaganski in the final. ===2015=== Gurney's Irish Matchplay title earned him a place in the preliminary round of the 2015 World Championship and Scott MacKenzie missed one dart to eliminate him 4\u20130. Instead, Gurney levelled at 3\u20133 before MacKenzie missed a dart at double 11 to complete a 142 finish which allowed him to step in and seal a 4\u20133 win. Gurney then lost 3\u20131 against Ronnie Baxter in the first round. From the last 32 stage of the fifth UK Open Qualifier, Gurney beat Alan Norris, Peter Wright and Dave Chisnall to reach his first PDC semi-final where he was defeated 6\u20132 by Michael Smith. The performance helped him to enter the UK Open at the third round stage and he thrashed Kevin McDine 9\u20131 to play John Henderson in the fourth round. Gurney won five legs in a row between 13 and 15 darts to surge 8\u20137 ahead, before Henderson sent the tie into a deciding leg which he won. His second semi-final came at the 10th Players Championship event and he was eliminated 6\u20133 by Joe Murnan. Gurney lost 2\u20130 in sets to Robert Thornton in the first round of the World Grand Prix, but two quarter-final exits saw him play in the Players Championship Finals for the first time. He averaged 101.38 in a 6\u20132 victory over Kim Huybrechts and then knocked out reigning world champion Gary Anderson 10\u20134, winning the last six legs in a row, to reach his first major quarter- final. Gurney then advanced to the semi-finals with a 10\u20135 victory over Benito van de Pas, but from level at 2\u20132 with Michael van Gerwen, Gurney lost nine successive legs to exit the tournament. ===2016=== Gurney won the first set of his second round match against Anderson at the 2016 World Championship. He went on to lose 4\u20131, but missed a dart to win the second set and four to win the third. He averaged 105.18 in getting past Peter Wright 6\u20134 in the third round of the Dutch Darts Masters and then averaged 106.84 during a 6\u20134 quarter-final win over Adrian Lewis. Gurney swept into his first PDC final with a 6\u20131 win over Mensur Suljovi\u0107, but lost 6\u20132 to world number one Van Gerwen. ==World Championship results== ===BDO=== * 2009: Second round (lost to Martin Adams 2\u20134) * 2010: Second round (lost to Martin Adams 1\u20134) ===PDC=== * 2013: Second round (lost to Dave Chisnall 1\u20134) * 2015: First round (lost to Ronnie Baxter 1\u20133) * 2016: Second round (lost to Gary Anderson 1\u20134) ==Career finals== ===WDF major finals: 1 (1 runner-up)=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- |width=\"80\"|Outcome |width=\"20\"|No. |width=\"50\"|Year | style=\"width:250px;\"|Championship | style=\"width:200px;\"|Opponent in the final |width=\"70\"|Score |- | style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Runner-up | 1. | 2008 | Europe Cup Singles | Mark Webster | 0\u20134 (s) |} ==References== ==External links== *Official Website *Profile and stats on Darts Database Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:Darts players from Northern Ireland Category:Professional Darts Corporation players Category:British Darts Organisation players Category:People from Derry (city) ",
