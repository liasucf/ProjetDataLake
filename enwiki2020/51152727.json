Fishing is mainly done by men and shellfish collection by women and children. Shrimps, fish, oysters and mussels are harvested, sorted, in some cases smoked, and sold to middlemen who take the product to Salvador. Other economic activities include agriculture, crafts, and more recently fish farming. Earnings are generally well above the minimum wage. As of 1998 only 4% of the population had high school education and 28% were illiterate. As of 2009 the state government had selected the extreme south of the reserve as the site for a naval centre, and was proceeding with implementation. The local communities had not been consulted.
