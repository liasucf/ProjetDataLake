For the six Horizontal field events (all four throwing events, the long and triple jumps), there were three initial attempts in each event. Following this, the top six athletes from these trials advanced to the final three rounds. At each subsequent round, the lowest placing athlete, based on all attempts thus far in the competition, was eliminated. In the vertical jumps (high jump and pole vault) each competitor was limited to three attempts at any specific height and eight attempts in total. ===Scoring=== Each team was allowed to field 4 athletes in each individual event, and two teams of four in each relay. The winner of each individual event and each relay scored 9 points, the second 7 points, the third score 6, and so on. The highest score either team could achieve in a single event was therefore 27 points, and the lowest (barring disqualification, failure to finish or record a mark) 10 (or in relays, 16 and 11 respectively). Across the competition, a theoretical high score of 966 points was available, and a theoretical low score, ignoring disqualifications, DNFs and no marks, of 373. However, the match would be won once either team achieves over half of all available points - the winning post for the Match before it commenced was therefore 670 points. Following withdrawals and 'no marks' on day one of the Match, the winning post was recalculated as 662 points.The Match USA v Europe Team Manual.
