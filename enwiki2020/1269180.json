It is the capital of Chalkidiki. ==Geography== Polygyros town (pop. 6,121 at the 2011 census) is built in the shape of an amphitheatre on a plateau on the south west side of the mountain Cholomontas. It is south of Greek National Road 16 (Thessaloniki - Arnaia). Polygyros is located SE of Thessaloniki, NE of Nea Moudania, NW of Sithonia and SW of Arnaia. The municipal unit (the municipality before 2011) has a population of 10,721 inhabitants and a land area of 470.933 km\u00b2. Other large villages in the municipal unit are Kal\u00fdves Polyg\u00fdrou (1,333), \u00d3lynthos (1,111), Taxi\u00e1rchis (903), and Vr\u00e1stama (700). ==Name== There are different speculations about the origin of Polygyros' name. Some claim that it comes from the combination of poly (much) and geros (strong), because of the healthy climate. Others believe that the words poly and ieros (sacred) have given the present name, because of an ancient temple in the area. Also an old landowner, named Polyaros, offers a possible etymology. According to another possible etymology, the name derives from poly and gyros (round), possible due to the town's amphitheatric position.Babiniotis, G. (1998). Lexiko tis Neas Ellinikis Glossas. Kentro Lexikologias. Athina. ==Municipality== The municipality Polygyros was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 4 former municipalities, that became municipal units:Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior *Anthemountas *Ormylia *Polygyros *Zervochoria The municipality has an area of 947.417 km2, the municipal unit 470.933 km2. ==History== Archaeological Museum of Polygyros Polygyros town hall View of a square Saint Nicholas church in Polygyros ===Antiquity=== Some situate in the broader area of modern Polygyros the ancient city of Apollonia.
