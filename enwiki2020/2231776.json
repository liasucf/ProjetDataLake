There are several cultivars available for the home gardener. The Korean herbal root, doraji (Korean: \ub3c4\ub77c\uc9c0), does not come from this plant, but rather from the Chinese bellflower (Platycodon grandiflorus), although do-ra-ji is usually translated from Korean as \"bellflower\". takesimana Category:Flora of Korea Category:Garden plants Category:Endemic flora of South Korea ",
