A supply-side economist, he was instrumental in the design of the 2003 Bush Tax cuts \u2014an issue which split the economics profession on ideological lines, with those leaning left opposed and those leaning right supportive. See Economists' statement opposing the Bush tax cuts.

After Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee, Hubbard was mentioned as a potential Treasury secretary (which eventually went to Steven Mnuchin), and also as a potential Fed chair, a role expected to become open in February 2018. Hubbard had been critical of both Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, including after Bush had suspended his campaign. In August 2016, Hubbard declined say which candidate he supported in the general election, but did say that Trump's taxation plans and their impact on economic growth were in a \"direction\" somewhat better than Clinton's plans.

Ferguson argues that deregulation led to the 2008 international banking crisis sparked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the sale of Merrill Lynch. In the interview, Ferguson asks Hubbard to enumerate the firms from whom he receives outside income as an advisory board member in the context of possible conflict of interest. Hubbard, hitherto cooperative, declines to answer and threatens to end the interview with the remark, \"You have three more minutes; give it your best shot.\"Transcript excerpt on \"A Searing Look At Wall Street In 'Inside Job', Charles Ferguson interviewed by Melissa Block\", which aired October 1, 2010 on NPR's All Things Considered. During the program, Ferguson explained to Melissa Block, \"Well, the entire interview was fairly contentious, as you can imagine. It surprised me somewhat to realize that these people were not used to being challenged, that they'd never been questioned about this issue before. They clearly expected to be deferred to by me and I think by everybody.\" After the release of the film, Columbia ramped up ongoing efforts to strengthen and clarify their conflict of interest disclosure requirements.\"\u2018Inside Job\u2019 prompts new look at con\ufb02ict of interest policy,\" published April 13, 2011, in the Columbia Spectator.

Center for Leadership and Ethics, has recommended that the film be shown to all business school students.) One of Hubbard's consulting contracts was examined in a deposition in 2012. His work for Countrywide Financial for $1200/hr, attesting that the lender's loans were no worse than a control group of mortgages and not fraudulent, was examined by an attorney for MBIA. MBIA was suing Countrywide over its mortgage practices. ==Books== Hubbard is the author of a number of economic and socioeconomic texts, with a focus on deregulation, conservative fiscal policy and taxation.
