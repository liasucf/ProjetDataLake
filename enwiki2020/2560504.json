    "text": "Blood and Fire is a British reggae record label specialising in reissues of 1970s dub. ==History== Steve Barrow, Bob Harding, Mick Hucknall, Elliot Rashman and Andy Dodd formed the record label in Manchester in 1993 with the objective of reissuing roots reggae, dub and DJ albums with the integrity of jazz reissues.Meschino, Patricia (2014) \"VP Records Relaunches Classic Reggae Label Blood and Fire\", Billboard, 19 February 2014. Retrieved 19 February 2014 In the process, Blood and Fire influenced the overall aesthetic of other labels issuing archival Jamaican recordings in the 1990s and beyond. Initial releases drew on mid-1970s Bunny Lee produced material but the label subsequently reissued material produced by Yabby You and Glen Brown along with the Lee \"Scratch\" Perry produced Congos set Heart of the Congos and a three-CD Big Youth set, Natty Universal Dread. Despite the reissue objective, the label released two one-riddim albums. The first was Tree of Satta (2003) which utilised the original \"Satta Massagana\" riddim featuring a mixture of new and vintage voicings over the riddim along with the original version of the song by The Abyssinians. The second, Fisherman Style (2006), utilised The Congos' \"Fisherman\" riddim and featured new material from a variety of singers including Horace Andy, U Roy, Big Youth, Luciano, Tony Tuff and Dillinger. The label also had a sound system which has featured original Jamaican artists such as Dilinger, Trinity, Ranking Joe, U Brown, Horace Andy, Dennis Alcapone, U Roy, Spikey Tee, Country Culture, Raggamonica along with Steve Barrow and Dom Sotgiu. In July 2006 the sound went to Japan with U Roy on a three date sell out tour. In 2007, news leaked out via the company's popular message board that Blood and Fire had stopped trading as an active company. The loss of their American and French distributors due to bankruptcy as well as some unfortunate management decisions, combined with an industry-wide decline in sales, were to blame. Although the company declined to make any official announcement, it was effectively out of business. In 2014 it was announced that the label would be relaunched in conjunction with VP Records, with Barrow overseeing future projects.Minsker, Evan (2014) \"Reggae Label Blood and Fire Records Relaunches\", Pitchfork Media, 18 February 2014.
