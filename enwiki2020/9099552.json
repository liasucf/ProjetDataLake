    "text": "Manuera Benjamin R\u012bwai Couch (27 June 1925 \u2013 3 June 1996) was a New Zealand politician and rugby union player. He was a team-member of the All Blacks and the New Zealand M\u0101ori rugby union team in the 1940s. ==Early life== Couch was born in 1925 in Lyttelton. He was raised by his maternal grandmother in Christchurch until the age of eight, when he was sent to live with his maternal uncle near Pirinoa in rural Wairarapa. He was educated at \u014ctaki M\u0101ori College, and then, from 1940 to 1942, Christchurch Technical College. After a carpentry apprenticeship in Christchurch, Couch joined the Royal New Zealand Air Force in August 1943, and later transferred to the army. In 1945, Couch returned to Pirinoa to work as a builder, and in 1947 he married Bessie Carter, his childhood sweetheart. Carter was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Couch converted to that faith in 1949. ==Rugby union== A first five-eighth, Couch represented Wairarapa at a provincial level, and was a member of the New Zealand national side, the All Blacks, from 1947 to 1949. He played seven matches for the All Blacks including three internationals. Of Ng\u0101i Tahu and Ng\u0101ti Mutunga descent, he also played 20 matches for New Zealand M\u0101ori between 1948 and 1950. ==Political career== In the 1975 general election, he was elected to Parliament as the National Party member of parliament for the Wairarapa electorate, thus becoming (with Rex Austin) only the second and third M\u0101ori (after Sir James Carroll) to win a general electorate (as opposed to a M\u0101ori electorate). He served as Minister of M\u0101ori Affairs and Minister of Police in the third National Government, but lost his seat in 1984 to Labour's Reg Boorman. While Minister of Police, he called for the birch to be introduced for violent offenders and allowed the police to use longer batons. He created some controversy by wearing a Springbok rugby team blazer at the time of their 1981 tour of New Zealand as well as attending a public meeting organised by the League of Rights. This was despite his having been denied entry to South Africa as part of the All Blacks rugby team in the 1940s because of his race. In 1977, Couch was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal, and in 1990 he received the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 1991 Queen's Birthday Honours, Couch was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services. ==Later life and death== In the 1990s, Couch was involved in various M\u0101ori organisations. He died in 1996 in Masterton. ==References== |- Category:1925 births Category:1996 deaths Category:New Zealand National Party MPs Category:Members of the New Zealand House of Representatives Category:New Zealand MPs for North Island electorates Category:Members of the Cabinet of New Zealand Category:New Zealand sportsperson-politicians Category:New Zealand Latter Day Saints Category:Converts to Mormonism from Methodism Category:New Zealand international rugby union players Category:M\u0101ori All Blacks players Category:Rugby union fly-halves Category:M\u0101ori MPs Category:Ng\u0101i Tahu Category:Ng\u0101ti Mutunga Category:Companions of the Queen's Service Order Category:New Zealand military personnel of World War II Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 1987 New Zealand general election Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 1984 New Zealand general election Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 1972 New Zealand general election Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 1963 New Zealand general election Category:Toastmasters members ",
