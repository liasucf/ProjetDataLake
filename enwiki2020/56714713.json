    "text": "In Brazilian football, the term Big Twelve () refers to a group of twelve clubs: Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro, Botafogo, Corinthians, Cruzeiro, Flamengo, Fluminense, Gr\u00eamio, Internacional, Palmeiras, Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo and Vasco da Gama. They are considered to be the most popular and successful sides in Brazilian football, having won all but six editions of the Brasileir\u00e3o between them since the inception of the tournament. == The clubs == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !

For a long time, there were no national tournaments in Brazil (with the first edition of the Brasileir\u00e3o being only held in 1959) and competition between teams from different states was sparse (with the Torneio Rio-S\u00e3o Paulo, held irregularly between 1933 and 1966 and then from 1993 to 2002, being the most notable tournament of this nature); thus, these clubs first earned their distinguished reputation for being dominant within state borders. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ Performances in the Campeonato Carioca |- !

Even away from state borders, it isn't hard to find supporters of Big Twelve clubs., often surpassing even local clubs. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ Supporters Numbers in Brazil |- ! Club !

It's at times portrayed as a rigid construct that excludes teams that merit a place in this group and at other times it's argued to be an outdated definition that includes clubs whose place is not merited nowadays. === The case for more teams === ==== Esporte Clube Bahia ==== Bahia hails from Salvador, Bahia and is one of the two major clubs from the Campeonato Baiano (the other being Vit\u00f3ria). It is the only non-Big Twelve club to have two Brasileir\u00e3o titles to its name (tied with Gr\u00eamio and Botafogo and surpassing Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro), notably beating Pel\u00e9 and Os Sant\u00e1sticos in the final of the 1959 edition. Numerable speaking, its supporters compete with those of Fluminense and Botafogo and are ahead of any non-Big Twelve ones. It is, in fact, one of the Clube dos 13's founding members alongside the Big Twelve. Prior its first relegation in 1997, Bahia was considered one of the biggests clubs in Brazil. However, its Brasileir\u00e3o campaigns have been generally unimpressive since the 1980s, and the club spent much of the 2000s outside the first division. Bahia was relegated in 1997 to the Campeonato Brasileiro Serie B and only come back to the top tier of Brazilian football in 2000 with a political maneuver, after cbf's withdrawal from organizing the championship of that year due to legal problems and handing it to Clube dos 13, because the club failed in achieve the promotion to Serie A in 1998 and 1999. Bahia was again relegated to Serie B in 2003 and relegated to Serie C in 2005, the low-point in the history of the club. The team disputed two seasons of Serie C until achieve its first promotion in history in 2007 to the Serie B, and in 2010 the team was promoted for the first time to the Brasileir\u00e3o. Bahia was relegated in 2014 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A, but this time they only became two seasons out of S\u00e9rie A and made the comeback in the 2017 edition The club also lags behind Big Twelve clubs in financial assets. ==== Paran\u00e1 State ==== From Curitiba one of the main clubs in the city are Coritiba Foot Ball Club and Club Athletico Paranaense and the league this state is the Campeonato Paranaense. Athletico Paranaense is often regarded as one of the best-run clubs in Brazil, with financial results that rival those of the Big Twelve. The club has won the Brasileir\u00e3o once, in 2001, and its best campaign at the Copa Libertadores was a runner-up showing in 2005. However, the club has a very poor pre-1990s record at the Brasileir\u00e3o and its fanbase is relatively small compared to Big Twelve clubs and very much contained within Paran\u00e1's borders. Coritiba won one title of Brasileir\u00e3o, conquered in 1985 and it was the first club of Paran\u00e1 to participate Copa Libertadores, in 1986, as well as the first club to carry an expression title in its state. The club is known for having the biggest fanbase in the state. Athletico Paranaense also won the titles of Copa do Brasil, which neither the G12 clubs Botafogo and S\u00e3o Paulo won, and also Copa Sudamericana (or another of its predecessors), which Fluminense didn't win. ==== Other clubs ==== Like the Big Twelve and Bahia, Coritiba and Athletico Paranaense, the teams Guarani, Portuguesa, Goi\u00e1s, Sport and Vit\u00f3ria were also members of the Clube dos 13, that were composed by the most important and traditional on that period. But each one of them had issues after that. Guarani, the 1978 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A champion and Sport Club do Recife and the 1987 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A champion, are the other Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A champions outside the Big Twelve. They both struggles with financial problems, and Sport has the worst financial situation between all clubs that plays in Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A this year. Goi\u00e1s and Vit\u00f3ria spent mostly of previous seasons on the second division, but achieved good things on the last years. Goi\u00e1s was the 2010 Copa Sudamericana runner-up, and Vitoria was the 1993 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A and 2010 Copa do Brasil runner-up.CBF Club Ranking - official site After the \"H\u00e9verton Case\", that made the team been relegated to the second division, the Portuguesa was relegated more two times straight, and now do not compete any national championship, been on Campeonato Paulista S\u00e9rie A2. During the early 2000's, S\u00e3o Caetano got noticed in both national and international media after being a finalist of 2002 Copa Libertadores, the most important tournament in South America. They lost to Olimpia of Paraguay on penalties. After the Red Bull took over the control of the 1991 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A runner- up, Clube Atl\u00e9tico Bragantino, and changed its name to Red Bull Bragantino. The club claims that it will be one of Brazil's best clubs in the future. === The case for less teams === It is often argued if there is too big a gap even between Big Twelve clubs in honours (outside of state leagues) and fanbase size. Flamengo and Corinthians could be argued to be in a tier of their own in terms of supporters, far above third place S\u00e3o Paulo, but this supposed superiority does not translate into the pitch, with many teams claiming more titles than them in the Brasileir\u00e3o, Copa do Brasil, Copa Libertadores, and Club World Cup. Similarly, it's sometimes argued if Santos, Fluminense and Botafogo are below their regional rivals (Corinthians, S\u00e3o Paulo and Palmeiras all boast significantly more supporters than Santos; Flamengo and Vasco da Gama lay claim to more international success than Fluminense and Botafogo). However, these three clubs' importance to Brazilian football cannot be understated: Santos's Os Sant\u00e1sticos was the most dominant Brazilian side ever, winning six Brasileir\u00e3o and eight Campeonato Paulista titles in the 1960s; Botafogo hold the record for most capped players for the Brazil national football team in World Cups; and Fluminense introduced the sport to Rio de Janeiro, being the oldest active club in Rio, with the birth of the Brazil national football team happening on its grounds in a friendly against Exeter City. == See also == * State football leagues in Brazil * Big Five (Argentine football) * Big Four (Mexico) * Big Three (Netherlands) * Big Three (Portugal) == References == Category:Football in Brazil Category:Santos FC Category:Cruzeiro Esporte Clube Category:CR Vasco da Gama Category:Clube de Regatas do Flamengo Category:Clube Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro Category:Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas Category:Sport Club Corinthians Paulista Category:Fluminense FC Category:Gr\u00eamio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense Category:Sport Club Internacional Category:Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras Category:S\u00e3o Paulo FC Category:Nicknames in sports Category:Association football terminology ",
