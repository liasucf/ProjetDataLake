    "text": "{| |} The Pratt & Whitney Canada PW300 series is a family of turbofan jet engines developed by Pratt & Whitney Canada specifically for business jet applications. ==Design and development== The basic configuration of the PW300 is as follows: single-stage fan, driven by a three-stage low pressure turbine, supercharging a four-stage axial/single-stage centrifugal high-pressure compressor, driven by a two-stage high-pressure turbine. An annular combustor is featured. Some versions have an unmixed exhaust, but the PW306 and PW308 include a forced mixer. A Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system is incorporated. The PW307A is a new centre-line engine developed specifically for a tri-jet application on the Dassault Falcon 7X. The PW307 was certified by Transport Canada in March 2005. The PW308A has been chosen to power the Scaled Composites White Knight Two, the launch aircraft for Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo.Press release preview Unscheduled interventions went from 85% in 2015 to 20% in 2017, driving up the PW307 availability thanks to Pratt's digital platform, and engine dispatch reliability is at 99.4% for the Falcon 7X/8X powered by the PW307. ==Variants== Two of the three PW307A installed on the Dassault Falcon 7X Falcon 2000S PW306 fan, Cessna Citation Latitude ;PW305A :20.81kN variant used on the Bombardier Learjet 60 ;PW305B :23.41kN variant used on the Hawker 1000 ;PW306A :25.36kN variant used on the IAI Galaxy & Gulfstream G200 ;PW306B : variant used on the Dornier 328JET ;PW306C :25.67kN variant used on the Cessna Citation Sovereign ;PW306D :26.28kN variant used on the Cessna Citation Sovereign + ;PW306D1 :25.6 kN variant used on the Cessna Citation Latitude ;PW307A :28.49kN variant used on the Dassault Falcon 7X Originally 6,100lb-thrust (27.1kN) growth version of the PW306, smaller than the PW308, featuring swept-blade fan, increased core airflow, low NOx emissions combustor, increased turbine capacity and a more efficient exhaust mixer; integrated propulsion system including Macchi/Hurel Dubois nacelle and thrust-reverser; certification scheduled for the end of 2004. ;PW307B :variant used on the Bombardier Learjet 85 ;PW307D :variant used on the Dassault Falcon 8X ;PW308A :30.69kN (6900 lb) variant used on the Hawker 4000 & Scaled Composites White Knight Two ;PW308C :31.14kN variant used on the Dassault Falcon 2000EX/DX/LX ==Applications== * Cessna Citation Latitude * Cessna Citation Sovereign * Dassault Falcon 2000EX/DX/LX * Dassault Falcon 7X * Fairchild Dornier 328JET * Fairchild Dornier 428JET * Gulfstream G200 * Hawker 1000 * Hawker 4000 * Learjet 60 * Learjet 85 * Scaled Composites White Knight Two ==Specifications (PW306B)== ==See also== ==References== ==External links== * Pratt & Whitney Canada PW300 page Category:High-bypass turbofan engines Category:Mixed-compressor gas turbines Category:Pratt & Whitney Canada aircraft engines ",
