She flies a helicopter and is usually at the front lines for fighting Boomers. ; Koji Takahashi Koji Takahashi is the Inspector in charge of Branch operations. ; Rod Kimball Sergeant Rod Kimball is a Boomer who serves alongside Buzz in Branch.

If one comes in without expectations of greatness and prepared for the violence, you'll likely enjoy it just fine.\" Browne recommended it for fans of cyberpunk, and also that it would be for mature teens and adults for its graphic violence and implicit sex. Chris Beveridge of the Fandom Post found the audio and video for the collection to have no major issues, but disliked the cover artwork. He liked that the series featured some of the \"dark underbelly\" of the Bubblegum Crisis universe and without the bubblegum or the pop of the previous series and OVAs. He wrote: \"This is a cop drama of a sort set in the future that tells three engaging tales and lets the third one really play with the world we\u2019ve come to know. This is the kind of show I want to see as a series, not that other AD Police TV series. This is the good stuff.\" ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * * Category:A.D.
