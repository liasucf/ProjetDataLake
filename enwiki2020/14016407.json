    "text": "synth is a skinnable Java look and feel, which is configured with an XML property file. According to Sun, goals for synth were: * Enable to create custom look without writing any code. * Allow appearance to be configured from images. * Provide the ability to customize the look of a component based on its named properties. * Provide a centralized point for overriding the look of all components. * Enable custom rendering based on images, or user-defined s. == History== synth is available beginning with version J2SE 5.0 of Java (see Java version history). Java SE 6 Update 10 release and newer contain Nimbus, a cross-platform Look and Feel implemented with Synth. However, for backwards compatibility, Metal is still the default Swing look and feel. ==Architecture== Synth is a skinnable look and feel in which all painting is delegated to the components, without having to write any code (see ). However synth does not provide a default look, and components that are not defined in the synth XML file will not be painted. It is however possible to assign a default style to all other widgets, and customize styles for some specific widgets only. ==Example== The following XML declaration defines a style named textfield and binds it to all text fields. The defaultStyle allows to set a default font, foreground and background colors to all other widgets. Supposing that the XML declaration is defined in a file named synthExample.xml, the following code loads the XML definition file and sets the current look and feel to synth (loading a synth Look and Feel is done using the load method of the class): SynthLookAndFeel laf = new SynthLookAndFeel(); laf.load(new File(\"synthExample.xml\").toURI().toURL()); UIManager.setLookAndFeel(laf); ==See also== * Swing, the standard cross- platform widget toolkit for Java * Pluggable look and feel ==References== ==External links== * API documentation * synth file format * synth tutorial * another synth tutorial * nimbus home page Category:Java (programming language) Category:Java (programming language) libraries Category:Java APIs Category:Widget toolkits ",
