    "text": "\"I'm Into You\" is a song recorded by American singer Jennifer Lopez, featuring American rapper Lil Wayne. It was released for Lopez seventh studio album Love? (2011). It was written by Taio Cruz and Lil Wayne, and produced by Mikkel S. Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen (known collectively as Stargate). In the mid-tempo pop and R&B; song, that features double entendre lyrics, Lopez sings about being lost in love and her lover's attraction, while Wayne teases with clever wordplay. The song was originally due for release as a promotional single in the US and Canada on April 5, 2011, but was unlocked and released in those markets four days earlier on April 1, 2011, through a campaign on Lopez's Facebook page. The song was later serviced to rhythmic and urban radio on April 26, 2011, as the second single from Love?. \"I'm Into You\" received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics, who complimented the song's catchy hook, island-flavored production and playful lyrics. The song reached number one in Greece and Lebanon, number 41 on the US Billboard Hot 100, topped the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart, and reached the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. The music video for \"I'm Into You\" began production in Chichen Itza, Mexico on April 2, 2011 and was released on May 2, 2011 at Today. The video depicts the singer on a Mayan pyramid, as well as on a beach with her love interest; she also dances with two back-up dancers. The video received critical acclaim, praising her dance ability and beauty. ==Background== Following the commercial and critical failure of her sixth studio album Brave (2007) and while pregnant with twins Max and Emme, Lopez began working on new music for a future project in 2008. The project was kept under wraps until February 2009 when a new song from the recording sessions titled \"Hooked on You\" leaked online. Lopez addressed the leak on her official website in May 2009, stating that \"I'm always excited about my music and this [\"Hooked on You\"] is one of a few tracks I'm currently working on. I'm flattered by everyone's interest in the track and really excited for you to hear the real thing...\" Following the leak of \"Hooked on You\", \"One Love\" and \"What Is Love?\" (later re-titled \"(What Is) Love?\") were subsequently leaked online in May. The leaked songs were, at the time, meant to appear on a greatest hits album; that later turned into a studio album. The following month, Lopez told MTV's Larry Carol that the songs hinted at the musical direction of her then-upcoming seventh studio album. She also stated that she was keen to finish the album and several singles, with a potential release date for the end of 2009. Lopez released \"Louboutins\", a song written and produced by The-Dream and Tricky Stewart, as the project's lead single in November 2009. However, upon release, the song failed to garner enough airplay to chart, despite topping the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. Lopez subsequently left Epic Records in February 2010, citing that she had fulfilled her contractual obligations and now wished to release Love? under a new label. Her departure from the label temporarily halted production on the album, however upon signing a new contract with Island Records, recording resumed on the album. The New York Daily News revealed that Lopez would be taking some of the records recorded under Sony Music Entertainment to her new label so that they could be included on the album. Lopez released her first single with the label \"On the Floor\" featuring American rapper Pitbull in February 2011. The song topped the charts across the globe; peaking at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100, her highest peaking song on that chart in over eight years. The song became one of the most successful singles of the year. The song was well received by critics, who compared it to Lopez's 1999 singles \"If You Had My Love\" and \"Waiting for Tonight\". During an online chat with fans in March 2011, Lopez revealed that she was considering releasing \"I'm Into You\", featuring her favorite male rapper Lil Wayne, as the album's second single. On March 30, 2011, Lopez appeared on Ryan Seacrest's morning radio show On Air with Ryan Seacrest. There, she spoke about the upcoming release of her seventh studio album Love?, and her American Idol experiences. She also introduced a thirty-second preview of her new single \"I'm Into You\". Later that same day, the full song was leaked online. The song was used in a promotional campaign in North America on Lopez's Facebook page. If enough fans \"liked\" the song, it would be \"unlocked\" for early purchase on the iTunes Store. On April 1, the song was released to the iTunes Store in North America, four days earlier than planned in those markets. The song was then sent to rhythmic and urban airplay in the United States on April 26, 2011, as the second single from Love?. \"I'm Into You\" was solicited to contemporary hit radio stations in the United States on June 12, 2011. ==Music and lyrics== \"I'm Into You\" is a midtempo pop and R&B; song, with a length of three minutes and twenty seconds (3:20). The song was written by Taio Cruz, Lil Wayne and Stargate (Mikkel S. Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen), who also produced the song. The song features a guest rap from Lil Wayne, who Lopez cited as being her favorite male rapper at the time. Lopez's vocals for the song were recorded and produced by Kuk Harrell, with additional recording from Jim Annunziato, Josh Gudwin and Chris \"TEK\" O'Ryan at Roc the Mic Studios in New York City and Westlake Recording in Los Angeles. Lil Wayne's rap was recorded by Mike \"Banger\" Cadahia, with assistance from Elizabeth Gallardo. Eriksen handled audio engineering of \"I'm Into You\", alongside Miles Walker with additional engineering from Damien Lewis. The song was later mixed by Phil Tan with the assistance of Lewis at Ninja Club Studios in Atlanta, Georgia. \"I'm Into You\" is built around a \"trippy\" and \"synth- heavy beat\" and \"beachy feel\" with a \"club-ready refrain,\" according to Mary Kinney from AOL Music. Kinney commented about Lil Wayne's verses, describing lines like \"I'm falling for you, baby / I need a parachute\" as clever wordplay. According to Rap-Up, on the song, Lopez \"finds herself lost in love\" and her lover's attraction. The song's \"lithesome beat\" is pitched \"somewhere between Puerto Rican reggaeton and Jamaican dancehall\". \"I'm Into You\" is built around a \"na-na-na\" hook, that has received similarities to Rihanna's \"What's My Name?\". \"I'm Into You\" is a \"Jamaica-meets-Latin late-night summer jam that is both bang-on-trend and worryingly infectious. The result is the Pina Colada of pop songs - smooth, fruity and beautifully presented...but with a surprising amount of kick.\" \"I'm Into You\" follows the \"pop blueprint\"; \"layering sparkling synths over sharply bouncing, island tinged percussion\" and a \"dance floor friendly bass line\". ==Critical reception== \"I'm Into You\" received positive reviews. * Mary Kinney of AOL Music praised the song's \"unstoppable production\", stating that: \"The hook of Lopez repeating 'I'm into you' will be ringing in listeners' ears long after the song is over, and Lil Wayne provides clever wordplay... The club-ready refrain challenges the listener to not sing along. This song is bound for greatness\". * Bradley Wete from Entertainment Weekly agreed, further commenting that Lopez is at \"her perfect pitch. Her notoriously thin voice never strains\u2013which is great for critical ears.\" * Robbie Daw of Idolator said that although the beat is sparse and the lyrics are borderline simplistic, \"the melodies (particularly the irresistible chorus) and Jennifer's warm vocals give this uplifting piece of pop an extra boost\". * Scott Shetler of PopCrush called the song one of the standout tracks on Love?, possessing \"one of the most memorable and infectious hooks on the record\". * Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone said that although the song \"should be a hot summer single\", the song's lyrics are \"painfully insipid, and the bland singsong tune fails to work its way into your mind's ear.\" He concluded by stating that: \"Even Weezy, sounding as irrepressible as ever, can't coax any pep out of the desultory J. Lo\". * Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised the song, calling it a \"summer-hit-in-the-making\" with a \"sexy island vibe and the kind of 'na-na-na' hook Rihanna has built an entire career around\". * Poppy Reid of The Music Network criticized the song for its reliance on autotune and lyrics \"you just don't expect (or want) from a 41-year-old\". ==Chart performance== Lopez performing \"I'm Into You\" on her 2012 Dance Again World Tour. \"I'm Into You\" debuted at number 72 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart for the issue dated May 21, 2011.

Throughout its production, Lopez shared multiple photos from the video shoot with her fans through social networking website Twitter. US Weekly reported that scenes were filmed at different locations around a Mayan archaeological site. During one of the scenes shot at night, the ancient columns were lit for Lopez to dance around. At its three-minute mark, the video switches to a dance-breakdown to the song \"Papi\" where Lopez is backed by two female dancers. Rap-Up released two images from the shoot, and wrote: \"A tatted Weezy leaned his back against People's Most Beautiful Woman in the World in the first images from the set.\" Telenovela star and model William Levy was cast as Lopez's love interest for the video. Lopez explained to Extra how she found the Cuban actor: \"I called my cousins and I said 'Who's the hottest guy right now?' and they're like William Levy! And I was like, 'Okay, let's get William Levy!\" The video aired on NBC's Today on May 2, 2011. Although Lil Wayne was pictured filming scenes with Lopez, on green-screen, in Los Angeles, he does not appear in the version of the video premiered on Today.
