Geils Band from 1967 to 1983 and as a successful solo artist. == Early life and education == Peter Wolf was born in The Bronx. He attended the High School of Music & Art, located in west Harlem near the Apollo Theater. He often attended the Apollo, seeing many of the famous soul, rhythm & blues, and gospel artists who influenced him. He moved to Boston, Massachusetts, to attend the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts on scholarship, where he studied painting. His first roommate was film director David Lynch. ==Career== In 1964, Wolf and fellow art students Paul Shapiro(guitar), Doug Slade(guitar), Joe Clark(bass), and Stephen Jo Bladd(drums) formed a group called The Hallucinations. They performed at nightclubs in the Combat Zone area of Boston and developed a large following as one of the first bands to play at the Boston Tea Party. During this period, they appeared on bills with The Velvet Underground, Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Van Morrison (who became close with Wolf while residing in nearby Cambridge, Massachusetts), John Lee Hooker, and Sun Ra. During his time performing with the Hallucinations, Wolf was asked to help establish Boston's radio station WBCN and became their first all-night deejay creating the moniker 'Woofa Goofa' as his on-air personality. His show became a popular late night staple where he interviewed many of the well-known rock, blues, and jazz artists that were touring through Boston in the late 1960s. In 1967 Wolf and Stephen Jo Bladd were asked to join the J. Geils Band which included members Magic Dick (harmonica), Danny Klein (bass) and Jay Geils (guitar). With the addition of Seth Justman (keyboards) the final line-up of the group was complete. Wolf and keyboardist Seth Justman were responsible for most of the band's songwriting. During the early days of MTV, the band enjoyed heavy airplay of their videos \"Centerfold\" and \"Love Stinks\". They toured stadiums with the Rolling Stones and others. Following the success of Freeze Frame, the other band members wanted to take the band in a new direction musically, but Wolf disagreed and they parted ways in 1983. The J.Geils Band released one record without Wolf, dissolving shortly thereafter. In 1999 the band reunited for a series of shows and has been nominated five times for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. == Solo work == Peter Wolf jumping (1982) Wolf's first solo record Lights Out (1984) was produced with Michael Jonzun, of the Jonzun Crew, and featured Adrian Belew, G.E.
