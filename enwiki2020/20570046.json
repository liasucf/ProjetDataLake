The native of Martinsville, Indiana, spent most of her childhood in Indiana, except for a period during her teens when she traveled to the Arizona desert to recover her health after being diagnosed with tuberculosis. Following her return to Indiana, she completed high school and began studying journalism college at Franklin College, in Franklin, Indiana, but left to enroll at Indiana University, and later attended the University of New Mexico. She began her career in journalism and publishing at Farm Life magazine in Spencer, Indiana, and moved to Lebanon, Indiana, during the Great Depression to work at the Lebanon Reporter for newspaper publisher Eugene C. Pulliam prior to their marriage in 1941.McFarland, Lois, \"Nina Mason Pulliam,\" in Afterwards, she worked with her husband as founding secretary-treasurer and a member of the board of Central Newspapers Inc., the media holding company he established in 1934. Upon his death in 1975, she became president of the company, a position she retained until 1979. Nina Pulliam also served from 1975 until 1978 as publisher of the Arizona Republic and the Phoenix Gazette, which began in 1946. Her stepson, Eugene S. Pulliam, became publisher of the company's two major newspapers in Indianapolis, the Indianapolis Star and the Indianapolis News. In 1970, she became the first woman admitted into DePauw University's Alpha chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, which was later named the Society of Professional Journalists.McFarland, p. 93. ==Mural== A new mural has been installed in the Indianapolis Special Collections Room on the Sixth Floor of Central Library.

The oldest title in the collection was published in 1542. Other locally published titles have been added over time. Another collector, Arthur H.
