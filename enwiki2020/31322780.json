    "text": "The Civil Guard Association for a Better Future () is a Hungarian militant organisation involved in anti-Roma activities in areas such as the town of Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6spata in early 2011, where they have been accused of intimidating the Roma population with weapons and dogs. The name originates from Szebb j\u00f6v\u0151t!, the regular greeting of the Levente (organization). The European Roma Rights Centre has claimed that the Civil Guard has ties to the Magyar Nemzeti G\u00e1rda, a new group sharing the same ideology as the banned Magyar G\u00e1rda. ==See also== *Hungarian National Defence Association ==References== Category:Antiziganism in Hungary Category:Paramilitary organisations based in Hungary Category:Far- right politics in Hungary Category:Racism in Hungary Category:Romani in Hungary ",
