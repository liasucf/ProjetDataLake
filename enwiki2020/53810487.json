It fires a bullet of diameter weighing , driven by of cordite, at a listed speed of . ==History== In Britain, from the inception of breech-loading rifles there were a large number of straight black powder paper and coiled brass cartridges developed of varying case lengths from 2 to 3 inches. Around 1905, Purdey loaded the 3 inch brass cartridge with a light cordite load to create this cartridge. Unusually for a proprietary cartridge, the .400 Purdey was introduced as a \"Nitro for Black\" loading, typically a mild loading of smokeless powder for a Black Powder Express cartridge, carefully balanced through trial to replicate the ballistics of the black powder version. In 1899 John Rigby & Company shortened the black powder predecessor of the .400 Purdey to and necked it down to to create the .400/350 Nitro Express which in turn later became the .350 Rigby No 2. ==Use== The .400 Purdey was reasonably popular in India for deer, boar and even tiger, and was available in both double rifles and more reasonably priced Martini action sporting rifles. Whilst obsolete, cartridges can still be purchased today from manufacturers such as Kynoch. ==See also== *List of rifle cartridges *10 mm rifle cartridges ==References== ==External links== * Ammo-One, \"400 Purdey\", ammo-one.com, retrieved 18 April 2017. * Cartridgecollector, \"400 Purdey Light Express 3 inch\", cartridgecollector.net, retrieved 18 April 2017. * The Spanish Association of Cartridge Collectors, \".400 Purdey\", municion.org, retrieved 18 April 2017.
