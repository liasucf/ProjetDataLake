Smith wrote, \"Dilg makes objects that are at once na\u00efve and sophisticated, familiar and enigmatic. The tension in the paintings between known and unknown, fine art and found art along with their small scale encourages a very intimate, personal viewing experience.\" Dilg has been awarded fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, Ragdale Foundation and Yaddo Foundation, and received a Fulbright Grant. He was a professor in the School of Art and Art History at the University of Iowa for over four decades, before retiring as Professor Emeritus in 2017.

His earliest work consisted of large, gestural, Abstract Expressionist canvasses. By the 1980s, his paintings featured more regular, dark lines separating abstract planes of color that engaged the picture edges; writers compared them to the work of Richard Diebenkorn and (despite their abstraction) to the quirkier Chicago Imagists. In the late 1980s, Dilg began a decade-long shift toward more restrained flat surfaces and simpler, centralized compositions. A solo exhibition at the Evanston Art Center (1996) marked his transition from purely formal concerns towards narrative and vaguely referential forms.Artner, Alan G. \"Season Preview,\" Chicago Tribune, September 10, 1995. This work gradually led to greater opportunities and attention, including representation (Luise Ross Gallery) and group shows (e.g., Andrea Rosen Gallery, Sikkema Jenkins & Co. and Jeff Bailey Gallery) in New York City and elsewhere.Suhre, Terry, Perfect Memories (catalogue), St. Louis, MO: University of Missouri-St. Louis, Gallery 210, 2001.Leffingwell, Edward. \"John Dilg at Luise Ross,\" Art in America, June 2002, p. 125.

Moving into the 2000s, Dilg was producing small, exactingly composed paintings of iconic, glyph-like forms that ranged from fully abstract shapes to barely recognizable animals and landscape elements, as in Hide (2001); New York Times critic Ken Johnson described them as exuding \"a modest archetypal mystery.\" This work increasingly referenced vernacular sources, reflecting Dilg's interests in the function of the souvenir as a carrier of recollected times, events and stories.Wright, Lesley. \"John Dilg,\" in Patient Process (Catalogue), Grinnell, IA: Grinnell College, Faulconer Gallery, 2001. == Mature work and reception == By 2006, Dilg committed fully to a spare landscape motif that engages its subject less in the historical sense than as a trope to metaphorically record and convey his relationship with the land. This work brings together diverse sources and precedents in a singular, personal vision: 19th-century chromolithography, Japanese woodcuts and Early Renaissance landscapes, folk or self-taught art, vintage postcards and game boards, thrift store paint-by-number waterfall paintings, handmade signs.Koeppel, Fredric. \"Subdued palette and spare images belie paintings' implications,\" GO Memphis, November 23, 2012. His interest in tourist, souvenir and folk-art sources stems from his desire to recover the immediacy, sense of wonder and discovery, and uncanniness of such imagery\u2014qualities that are often trained out of professional artists.McQuaid, Cate. \"The year in galleries: closed doors, open horizons,\" The Boston Globe, December 23, 2014.

Dilg's carefully chosen and composed pictorial elements often tap into the primal power of archetypal subjects: waterfalls and gorges (e.g., On Another Planet, 2012), towering sequoia forests and evergreens, and formations like Yosemite's Half Dome that evoke the American West of 19th-century artists like Albert Bierstadt and Thomas Moran, as well as the Gothic, moonlit landscapes of German Romantics, such as Caspar David Friedrich.Koeppel, Fredric. \"Memphis' top exhibitions rife with revelations,\" GO Memphis, Best of List, 10 best exhibitions of 2012, December 27, 2012.

Retrieved July 17, 2018. His technique often reveals a hint of underpainting, creating a halo-effect around his forms. Dilg works with a subtly shifting, limited palette of celadon greens, pale blues, and sandy or greyed browns that has been described as evoking Midwest prairies, the veiled light created by misty Pacific Northwest rains, and deep geologic time.Cooper, Ivy. \"John Dilg: Recent Paintings,\" Riverfront Times, May 5, 2004.

Boston Globe critic Cate McQuaid wrote that their \"almost pictographic simplicity\" and \"incantatory energy\" pulls viewers \"into an intimate, low-key exchange, quiet and deeply felt,\" yet also suggests monumental forms and vast pictorial space. Several reviewers note that in addition to a sense of deliberation and solitude (e.g., I Felt So Symbolic Yesterday (C.C.), 2016), humor often emerges in his work through a single, odd detail or element, as in Natural Wonder (2007) or Headdress (2011),Steven Zevitas Gallery Headdress, John Dilg Artists.

Writers John Yau and Steven Zevitas suggest that the late-career, national recognition Dilg has received was long overdue, with the delay a likely result of his (in Yau's words) residing in a \"fly-over state.\" In the 2000s, Dilg has had solo exhibitions at the Rhodes College (Memphis) and galleries including Regina Rex and Luise Ross (2000\u201311) in New York,Johnson, Stacey.
