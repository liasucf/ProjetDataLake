After three years of teaching botany at the college, she became one of the first faculty members at California Lutheran College in 1963. During her tenure at Cal Lutheran she brought her students along on scientific trips to Hawai'i, Fiji, New Zealand, Australia, and deserts and mountains of California. She also created an online directory for the university which included over 3,000 species. Collins also identified over a hundred plants for the university's arboretum, which is named in honor of Collins. In the mid-1980s, she helped with the preservation of Wildwood Mesa by discovering three endangered species in an area which was about to be developed: Conejo dudleya, Conejo buckwheat and Lyon's pentachaeta.Collins, Barbara J.
