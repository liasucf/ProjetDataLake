However, during one of the in-class previews of the show, he was falsely arrested for attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon. Minimum sentencing would have been 40 years behind bars. They released him in time for the closing night of the show, and after being forced to contemplate his life inside jail, he realized he wanted to pursue acting as a profession.

Within the dancing community on campus, he befriended the Kinjaz dance team cofounders Mike Song and Anthony Lee. == Career == === Acting === He pursued a full-time career as an actor.
