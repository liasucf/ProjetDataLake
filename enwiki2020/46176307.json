He wrote nine books and dozens of letters and op-ed essays for the New York Times, the Washington Post, and regional papers. He gave an invocation for a national audience at the 1924 Democratic National Convention. Prior to the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941, he strongly opposed going to war against Nazi Germany. ==Early life and education== Kinsolving was born in Halifax, Virginia, the son of the Rev. Ovid Americus Kinsolving (1822-1894)(who had worked in Middleburg, Virginia during the American Civil War and been imprisoned for his Confederate oratory) and his third wife. Three of his half brothers also became clergymen; his half-brother George Herbert Kinsolving became the Episcopal bishop of Texas.
