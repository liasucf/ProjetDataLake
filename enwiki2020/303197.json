    "text": "Star Wars logo This list of characters from the Star Wars franchise contains only those which are considered part of the official Star Wars canon. The list is divided between \"humans and humanoids\" and \"droids\". Some of these characters have additional and alternate plotlines in the non-canonical Star Wars Legends continuity, the characters found in that body of works are compiled in the list of Star Wars Legends characters and List of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic characters. ==Humans== Humans are a species in the fictional Star Wars universe. They are the most numerous and dominant species, with apparently millions of major and minor colonies galaxywide. Humans are native to many different worlds and are characterized by multidimensional complex personalities, that are both individual and unique. They are the only race accepted as pure by Emperor Palpatine. By the time the hyperdrive was invented, humans were already present on a few scattered worlds throughout the galaxy; according to the New Essential Chronology, the humans of Coruscant managed to send out a number of 'sleeper ships' between the fall of the Rakatan Infinite Empire and the invention of the hyperdrive. Star Wars humans are mostly biologically identical to real-life humans. The presence of ordinary humans in the story is important dramatically and the first movie establishes their vulnerability and weakness. Luke Skywalker's introduction early in the first movie was rewritten to establish this. In the Star Wars mythology, the human homeworld, according to the New Essential Chronology, is generally believed to be Coruscant. However, there is actually no real consensus on the issue; according to releases from the official Starwars.com site, the ancient human home world has simply been lost to history. Star Wars humans live on many different worlds throughout the galaxy, with many populations living together with several other species\u2014something which is most common either on the cosmopolitan worlds at the core, or on the frontier at the Outer Rim of the galaxy, such as on Tatooine. ===A-C=== ====Beckett==== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !width=\"10%\" | Name !width=\"25%\" | Portrayal !width=\"65%\" | Description |- | | Woody Harrelson (Solo: A Star Wars Story) | A criminal and Han Solo's mentor.
