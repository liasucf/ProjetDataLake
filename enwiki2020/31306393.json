    "text": "Steven Greenstreet (born March 14, 1979) is an American documentary filmmaker, known for the controversial film, 8: The Mormon Proposition, which was selected to premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. Currently residing in New York City, he has also worked as a video investigative journalist for The Huffington Post Investigative Fund and a video producer for the US State Department. == Career == Greenstreet's feature debut, This Divided State (2005), captures the agitated climate surrounding Michael Moore's invitation to speak at Utah Valley State College shortly before the 2004 presidential elections. The largely conservative community of Orem erupted with controversy, which Greenstreet approaches from all sides of the debate. The student council\u2019s decision to book Moore was met with protests, petitions, threats, lawsuits, a $25,000 bribe, and even a special appearance by Sean Hannity, who gives a talk on campus only a few days before Moore\u2019s arrival. Juxtaposing candidly personal interviews with shots of unruly demonstrations, the film becomes a microcosm of the national political divisions and the debates surrounding free speech. Greenstreet illustrates the escalating obesity epidemic in America with his documentary Killer at Large (2008). The film investigates disturbing trends in how not only food addiction, but stress and fear, under-regulation and misinformation all contribute to the nation\u2019s swelling weight problems. Examining the often unhealthy state of school lunches and negative influence of kid-oriented advertising, the documentary reveals connections between the government and the food industry, exposing how children are the real victims of this obesity crisis. Highlighting the example of twelve-year-old Brook Bates, whose 2006 liposuction surgery made national headlines, the film contemplates how the indoctrination of children to perpetuate unhealthy habits will supersede laying the blame on personal accountability. The premiere of 8: The Mormon Proposition (2010) at Sundance was met with a lengthy standing ovation despite the intense controversy surrounding it. The film was inspired by ballot measures like California\u2019s \"Prop 8,\" designed to legally prohibit same-sex marriage. Addressing the estimated $22 million Mormons had raised along with internal church documents, the film unravels an extensive campaign carried out by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) with intent to influence California\u2019s voters. Contrasting hard statistics with emotionally charged testimonials from gays and families, 8: The Mormon Proposition reveals the detrimental effect of the LDS church\u2019s persistent stance on homosexuality. The church has declined all of the filmmakers\u2019 requests for interviews; LDS spokesman Michael Purdy has commented on the matter, \u201cWe have not seen \u20188: The Mormon Proposition.\u2019 However, judging from the trailer and background material online, it appears that accuracy and truth are rare commodities in this film. Clearly, anyone looking for balance and thoughtful discussion of a serious topic will need to look elsewhere.\u201d In February 2013, it was announced that Greenstreet's next project was a documentary on pop singer Kesha. Greenstreet, along with Lagan Sebert, followed Kesha over two years as she performed in various countries and then returned to the U.S. to record her sophomore album, Warrior. The documentary was released by MTV and premiered in April 2013. == Filmography == * Kesha: My Crazy Beautiful Life (2013) (co-director/producer) * 8: The Mormon Proposition (2010) (co-director/producer) * Killer at Large (2008) (director/producer) * This Divided State (2005) (director/producer) == References == == External links == * Steven Greenstreet Homepage * 8: The Mormon Proposition Official Site * Category:American documentary filmmakers Category:1979 births Category:Living people ",
