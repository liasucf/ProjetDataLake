It is the deadliest air accident in Iceland. ==Accident and recovery== The aircraft was manufactured in 1944 as a Douglas C-47 Skytrain and later converted to DC-3 standard for civilian use. It was registered as TF-ISI to Flugf\u00e9lag \u00cdslands, now Air Iceland Connect, the domestic Icelandic airline. It left at 11.25AM on a scheduled one and a half hour flight from Reykjav\u00edk Airport to the former site of Akureyri Airport.\"Accident description\", Aviation Safety Network, Flight Safety Foundation, retrieved 27 February 2018.H\u00f6r\u00f0ur Geirsson, \"Flugslysi\u00f0 \u00ed H\u00e9\u00f0insfir\u00f0i\", Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0, 29 May 1997 . It was heard over Skagafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur and seen flying low over the water towards , the northernmost point between the Siglufj\u00f6r\u00f0ur and H\u00e9\u00f0insfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur fjords on the northern coast,\"Allir sem \u00ed henni voru f\u00f3rust: B\u00fai\u00f0 a\u00f0 flytja 24 l\u00edk til Akureyrar\", Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0, 31 May 1947, p. 1 .Vegager\u00f0in.is, \"Flugslys 1947\", via Magn\u00fas R\u00fanar Magn\u00fasson, H\u00e9\u00f0insfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur.is .

The last person to see the aircraft, who as a nine-year-old boy was on a farm 2 km from where the wreckage was found, recalled in 2014: \"v\u00e6ngurinn ... er ne\u00f0an vi\u00f0 grastorfuna sem \u00e9g stend \u00e1\" - \"the wing ... [was] lower than the grassy mound I was standing on\". but failed to arrive. The weather was very foggy and searchers were unable to locate the wreckage until next morning, when it was spotted from one of three search aeroplanes on the side of Hestfjall, the mountain to the west of H\u00e9\u00f0insfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur. The DC-3 had disintegrated, slid down the mountainside, and caught fire. There were no survivors of the four crew and 21 passengers. The pilot was presumed to have been flying visually over the water, as was normal at the time since there were few navigational aids on the route, and to have become aware of the mountain only at the last moment. The accident is estimated to have happened at 12.48PM.\"Crash of a Douglas DC-3 on Mt Hestfjall: 25 killed\", Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives, retrieved 27 February 2018. The bodies were taken by boat to \u00d3lafsfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur and from there, draped in the Icelandic flag, to Akureyri, where a dockside ceremony on their arrival on the evening of 30 May was attended by a crowd of about 4,000 people, and they were then transported to Akureyrarkirkja. ==Legacy== The accident is the deadliest air accident in Iceland and the second deadliest involving an Icelandic aircraft, after the crash of Icelandic Airlines Flight 001 in Sri Lanka in 1978.KMU, \"Sj\u00f6unda mesta slys \u00edslenskrar flugs\u00f6g\", Dagbla\u00f0i\u00f0 V\u00edsir, 8 April 1986, p. 2 .
