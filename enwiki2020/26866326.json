He was known for the swiftness of his attacks and his ability to evade capture by both volunteer regiments and U.S. Army detachments under General George Crook. He led a small band (including his brother Wahveveh) that raided and stole livestock and horses, causing fear within nearby communities. The band also attacked Indians living on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation. There has been some speculation that Paulina's hatred for the Warm Springs Indians and white settlers occurred in April 1859 when Dr. Thomas Fitch led Native Americans from the Warm Springs Indian Reservation to attack a band of Paiutes in the valley of the John Day River. The party killed 10 Paiute warriors, capturing the women and children and the rest of the band. Among those captured were Paulina and Wahveveh, both of whom were later sent to Fort Dalles only to be imprisoned for a short time.Braly, David. Crooked River Country: Wranglers, Rogues, and Barons. Pullman, WA: Washington State University Press. 2007, p. 31. Captain John M. Drake led one of the first military campaigns into the area. Paulina defeated an army attack on his camp near Juniper Butte, and the conflicts increased. The Paiute threat was broken up into two bands led by Paulina, of the Walpapi band, and Weahwewa, of the Kidutokado band.Michno, Gregory. The Deadliest Indian War in the West; The Snake Conflict, 1864-1868. Caldwell, Idaho: Caxton Press, 2007. 25 In one particular incident, Paulina arranged peace talks with the Chief of the Wascos, Queapama. However, under that guise, Paulina had one of his braves murder Queapama.Braly (2007). While predatory bands such as Paulina\u2019s certainly profited from these attacks, they ultimately contributed to the climate of hostility that increased the level of violence and the death toll in the region. All the resident groups\u2014settlers, native communities at Warm Springs and Umatilla, and the Northern Paiute\u2014engaged in retaliatory actions that resulted in the deaths of dozens of people, including women and children.

Clark near the junction of Bridge Creek and the John Day River. The raiders burned the house, stables, of hay, of oats and barley, and stole two horses and a cow, causing an estimated $6,494 of damage. Clark's wife was visiting her parents in the Willamette Valley at the time, but an unarmed Clark and his 18-year-old brother-in-law were collecting driftwood on the John Day when they saw the Paiutes. Paulina and his band spotted them and gave chase, but Clark managed to escape, and his brother-in- law hid in the river with only his nose out of the water for several hours undetected, although nearing hypothermia.Michno (2007), p. 169. Clark was able to gather a posse to try to salvage some of his stolen property.
