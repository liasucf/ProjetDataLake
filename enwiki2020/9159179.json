    "text": "The Rattlesnake Formation is a Miocene to late Pliocene geologic formation found along the John Day River Valley of Oregon, in the Western United States. ==Description== The formation is described in Geologic Formations of Eastern Oregon (1972) as follows: > The unit is composed of up to 700 feet of fanglomerate and finer terrestrial > sediments and a 40-foot thick ignimbrite unit which crops out in the middle > of the section. The gravel is well rounded and consists of pebbles of > basalt, chert, siltstone, diorite, rhyolite, and chert set in a medium- > grained matrix of poorly indurated volcanic sandstone. The ignimbrite > displays zonation typical of welded ashflow tuffs and is a prominent ridge > former.Geologic Formations of Eastern Oregon (East of longitude 121\u00b030'), > 1972. John D. Beaulieu. Bulletin 73. Oregon Department of Geology and > Mineral Industries. ==Age== The ignimbrite was radiometrically dated by the Potassium\u2013argon method at 6.4 million years by Evernden and James (1964).Evernden, J. F., and James, G. T., 1964. Potassium-argon dates of the Tertiary floras of North America: Am. Jour. Sci., v. 262, p. 945-974. ==Fossils== Middle and late Pliocene mammals have been recovered from beneath the ignimbrite.Fossils include ambeledon (four tusked elephants),Mylohyus(peccary),teleoceras(north american rhino),Indarctos (bear),pliohippus (a horse) and possibly Machairodus (a saber-tooth cat) ==References== Category:Geology of Oregon Category:Sandstone formations of the United States Category:Tuff formations Category:Miocene volcanism ",
