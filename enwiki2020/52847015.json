    "text": "Xing Qiyi () was a Chinese organic chemist who contributed to the total synthesis of bovine insulin, Xing is still well-known nowadays in China as the main editor of a highly-influential organic chemistry textbook. He was a member of China Democratic League since 1952. == Early life and education == Xing received Chinese traditional private education in his childhood. In 1933, he graduated from Fu Jen Catholic University with a diploma in Chemistry. Xing did his postgraduate work at University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign under Roger Adams's guidance and obtained a doctorate degree in 1936. Later he went to University of Munich, conducting research on bufotoxins at Wieland's laboratory. == Career == In 1937, Xing returned to China.

During 1964\u201365, Xing participated in the total synthesis of bovine insulin project, co-operating with Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences. In 1980, Xing was elected as an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. During 1981\u201387, Xing focused on the activation methods for the carboxyl group in the peptide synthesis, and developed related chemical reagents. == Personal life == Xing enjoyed collecting crafts relevant the tortoise.
