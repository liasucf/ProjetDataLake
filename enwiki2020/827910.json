    "text": "FK Liep\u0101jas Metalurgs () was a Latvian football club in the city of Liep\u0101ja and playing in the Virsl\u012bga. They played at the Daugava Stadium (capacity 5,083). In 2005 Liep\u0101jas Metalurgs became the first team other than Skonto Riga to win the Virsl\u012bga since the league restarted in 1991. After the 2013 league season the club was dissolved due to the bankruptcy of its sole sponsor metallurgical plant Liep\u0101jas Metalurgs. The club was replaced by FK Liep\u0101ja, founded in 2014. == History == Based in Liep\u0101ja, FK Liep\u0101jas Metalurgs, got their name from the city's metallurgical factory, founded in 1882, the only one of its kind in the Baltic States. The history of the club can be traced back to 1945 when two football clubs were founded in Liep\u0101ja \u2013 Daugava Liep\u0101ja and Dinamo Liep\u0101ja. === Daugava Liep\u0101ja and Dinamo Liep\u0101ja: 1945\u20131947 === In its debut season Daugava Liep\u0101ja were runners-up in the Latvian league behind the champions FK Dinamo R\u012bga. In 1946 Daugava were coached by former Olimpija Liep\u0101ja defender K\u0101rlis T\u012bls and with one of the best former Olimpija players Ernests Zi\u0146\u0123is in attack the team won its first Latvian title. Both Valdis Pultraks and Voldem\u0101rs Sudmalis were in the squad. Daugava again won the title again in 1947 and the squad included Miervaldis Dr\u0101znieks who went on to score 160 goals in the Latvian league. Daugava Liep\u0101ja also won the Latvian Cup in 1946 and 1947. Dinamo Liep\u0101ja did not play in the Latvian top league. However, in 1948 Dinamo won the Latvian Cup with future Liep\u0101ja player \u017danis Zviedris in the team. === Sarkanais Metalurgs: 1949\u20131961 === In 1949 Daugava Liep\u0101ja and Dinamo Liep\u0101ja merged to form Sarkanais Metalurgs which, for the next decade, was the strongest club in the Latvian league. In 1949, Sarkanais Metalurgs won both the league and the Latvian Cup. More titles followed in 1951, 1953, 1954, and from 1956 to 1958. They also won the Latvian Cup three times in a row from 1953 to 1955. In 1954 after beating Daugava R\u012bga in a match for the chance to play in the Soviet League a united Daugava-Metalurgs club was formed which included six Metalurgs players. In 1954, they competed in the \"USSR Class B 1954, 2nd zone\" of the Soviet First League the second tier in Soviet football. In the Latvian league the Metalurgs team was made up of mostly the reserve squad. In 1956 Daugava did not include the Metalurgs name in the Soviet League. In 1960 Sarkanais Metalurgs were given a place in the Soviet league and continued playing in the league under various names until 1990. In 1961, the club played as LMR Liep\u0101ja. === Zvejnieks Liep\u0101ja: 1962\u20131989 === In 1962, the club changed owners and was renamed Zvejnieks Liep\u0101ja. It was considered to be the second team for Daugava R\u012bga and the club's best players usually had to leave for Daugava. Also if Daugava players needed to have match practice they were sent to Liep\u0101ja. In the Soviet league Zvejnieks were usually a mid-table club. With the club playing in the Soviet and not the local league, players from other Republics of the Soviet Union came to play for Zvejnieks. In the 1960s, defender M\u0101rti\u0146\u0161 Lube was the club's captain. Jurijs Roma\u0146enkovs who went on to become the club's coach in 1989\u201390 played for Zvejnieks in the 1970s. In the 1980s Vladimirs \u017duks coached Zvejnieks and several bright players emerged with the club including J\u0101nis Intenbergs, Ilm\u0101rs Verpakovskis, Alekseja \u0160arando, Vladimirs Babi\u010devs and Ain\u0101rs Linards. A number of Daugava R\u012bga players also played for Zvejnieks including Raimonds Laiz\u0101ns and Dainis Deglis. === Olimpija Liep\u0101ja: 1990\u20131993 === In 1990, the club was renamed and given the name of a former Latvian club that played in the 1920s\u20131930s \u2013 Olimpija Liep\u0101ja. As Olimpija the club played in the Soviet league in 1990, but in 1991, after Latvia regaining its independence, they played only in the Latvian league and finished in the third place. The Olimpija period saw the emergence of Viktors Dobrecovs at the club. After the breakup of the Soviet Union the first seasons in the newly independent Latvia were difficult for Olimpija as they got financially weaker from year to year. === FK Liep\u0101ja: 1994 === In 1994, the club was renamed FK Liep\u0101ja but played only one season with that name. === DAG Liep\u0101ja: 1995\u20131996 === In 1995 FK Liep\u0101ja was merged with FC Dag R\u012bga to form DAG Liep\u0101ja. The club reached the 1995 Latvian Cup final where they lost 3\u20130 to Skonto FC. Ain\u0101rs Linards returned to the club in 1995. In the Latvian league the club finished 8th out of ten clubs in 1996. === Baltika Liep\u0101ja: 1996\u20131997 === In 1996, the club changed owners again and became Baltika Liep\u0101ja. In 1996 M\u0101ris Verpakovskis, the son of Ilm\u0101rs Verpakovskis and future Latvia national football team international made his debut for the club. For some time the club was on the brink of bankruptcy and struggled to stop the best players from leaving the club. However, the club got new funding from the local Metallurgy factory and for the 1997 season at last had a stable budget and ambitious plans again. === FK Liep\u0101jas Metalurgs: 1997\u20132013 === In 1998 Metalurgs with Jurijs Popkovs as their head coach finished second behind Skonto in the Latvian Virsl\u012bga and each season up to 2004 Metalurgs finished second in the championship. In the Latvian Cup they also lost three cup finals. In 2005 Metalurgs finally became Virsl\u012bga champions and won the first title for Liep\u0101ja in an independent Latvia since the 1930s. In 2006 Metalurgs also finally won the Latvian Cup. The next league title came in 2009. === 2013 === After the 2013 league season the club was dissolved due to the bankruptcy of its sole sponsor metallurgical plant Liep\u0101jas Metalurgs. There were talks held with potential investors about salvation of the club, but due to lack of suitable options a decision was made to end its existence. The club was replaced by FK Liep\u0101ja, founded in 2014. == Honours == *Virsl\u012bga winners ** 2005, 2009 *Virsl\u012bga runners-up ** 1998, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011 *Latvian Cup winners ** 1946, 1947, 1948, 1953, 1954, 1955, 1963, 1964, 2006 *Baltic League winners ** 2007 * Latvian Soviet league winners ** 1946, 1947, 1949, 1951, 1953, 1954, 1956, 1957, 1958 == League and Cup history == === Soviet Union === ;Liep\u0101jas Metalurgs {| class=\"wikitable\" !
