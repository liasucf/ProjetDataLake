Given a starting role with the Saints, \"Hollywood\", a nickname he picked up while with the Kansas City Chiefs for his particular style of dress and a name which carries to this day, quickly proved himself to be a premiere NFL receiver. He was selected to the Pro Bowl four out of his seven years with the Saints, and set single season franchise records for receiving yards (1,399), and receiving touchdowns (11-shared with Marques Colston) as well as the career franchise record for receiving touchdowns (50, a record surpassed by Colston in 2012..). Horn is also the Saints' all-time leader in 100-yard receiving games at 27. Horn had a career year in 2004 with his 1,399 receiving yards being second most in the league. His total was only six yards behind Carolina Panthers WR Muhsin Muhammad. The Saints signed Horn to a six-year contract extension in 2005. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Horn was noted for his support for the people of New Orleans and the Gulf region. As a leader of the Saints, he served as a public face of the team in many community events in recent months. He frequently visited evacuees in both San Antonio and the Houston Astrodome during the aftermath of Katrina. He criticized the NFL for not making a greater effort to care for the future of the Saints during this time of crisis.Beyond Katrina, to this day Joe donates time, energy and money to local charities in New Orleans and beyond. After the 2006 season the Saints asked the then 35-year-old receiver (who had suffered a groin injury during the 2006 season and had hamstring injuries in the past) to accept a pay cut. He refused and asked to be released. He was cut soon after his request. Horn set the Saints career mark in receiving touchdowns (50), making the Pro Bowl four times in five seasons, and compiled the second most receptions (523) and receiving yards (7,622) in Saints history. ===Atlanta Falcons=== In early March 2007, Horn started negotiations with the Atlanta Falcons. He signed a 4-year, $15 million contract with Atlanta. Later, in 2008, he requested to be traded from the team saying he didn't want to be a \"just-in-case guy\" for the Falcons. On August 19, 2008, the Falcons cut him. In his only season with the Falcons he made 27 receptions for 243 yards and one touchdown in 12 games. ===Retirement=== Horn worked out for the Lions, Titans, and Giants, but they ultimately passed and he did not play in the 2008 or 2009 seasons. In May 2010, Horn was selected for induction into the Saints Hall of Fame.. On June 23, 2010, it was announced that Horn had signed a contract with the Saints.

After scoring his second touchdown in a game in which he scored four, he pulled a cell phone out from underneath the goalpost padding with the help of teammate Michael Lewis and pretended to make a call. Horn's prank drew a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct and a $30,000 fine by the NFL. He later stated that he did not realize what he had done right away. This celebration was later used in the videogame Blitz: The League which allows excessive celebrations. 15 years later, New Orleans Saints wide receiver Michael Thomas recreated Horn's famous celebration in a game against the Los Angeles Rams after scoring a 72-yard touchdown. Horn \"teared up\" at the gesture, bought Thomas' jersey and called him the NFL's best wide receiver. ==Lawsuit against the NFL== In December 2011, Horn made headlines when he and a group of 11 other former professional players filed a lawsuit against the NFL.
