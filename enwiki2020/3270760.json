    "text": "The Smith & Wesson Model 686 is a six- or seven-shot double-action revolver manufactured by Smith & Wesson and chambered for the .357 Magnum cartridge; it will also chamber and fire .38 Special cartridges. Smith & Wesson introduced the Model 686 in 1981. It is the stainless steel version of the Model 586, which featured a blued steel finish. They are available ported and unported with a choice of 6- or 7-round cylinders. The Model 686 is based on S&W;'s L (medium) revolver frame. During the 1980s, Smith & Wesson developed its L-Frame line of .357 Magnums: the Model 581, Model 586, Model 681 and Model 686. The Models 581 and 681 have fixed sights, whereas the 586 and 686 use adjustable sights. ==Variants of the 686== The 686 has been available with barrel lengths as standard models and other barrel lengths either by special order from S&W;'s Performance Center custom shop, or acquired from or built by after-market gunsmiths. The Performance Center made a limited number of Model 686s chambered for .38 Super cartridges for competitive shooters. The 686 features a 6-round cylinder. The 686P variant, marketed as the Model 686 Plus, has a 7-round cylinder. The 686PP variant, with PP designating PowerPort, has an integral compensator (also known as a muzzle brake). The 686 has been made with pistol grips having a squared or rounded end (colloquially, \"square butt\" or \"round butt\"). The grips on the pistol can be changed, and multiple after- market options are available. The Model 686 has an adjustable rear sight, and until 1992, the versions had the option of an adjustable front sight. They had Goncalo alves hardwood grips until 1994, when the grip was replaced by a rubber Hogue grip. Through the years, there have been several variations on the Model 686. The Model 686 Classic Hunter was introduced in 1988 and has a barrel and a non-fluted cylinder; the Model 686 Black Stainless was introduced in 1989 and has either a barrel with a black finish, with production limited to 5000; the Model 686 National Security Special was introduced in 1992 and has a barrel; the Model 686 Target Champion was introduced in 1992 and has a match-grade barrel, adjustable trigger stop, and walnut grips; the Model 686 Power Port was introduced in 1994 and has a ported barrel; the Model 686 Plus was introduced in 1996 and has a barrel, adjustable sights, 7-shot cylinder, and Hogue rubber grips. As with all current Smith & Wesson revolvers, the 686 Plus now has a key lock integral to the frame of the gun. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Variant ! Caliber ! Weight ! Capacity ! Year !

S&W; put out a product warning and authorized a no-charge upgrade to make modifications to the revolver. All recalled and reworked guns were stamped with an M marking, signifying that they had been recalled and fixed; thus it is known as the M modification for all 686, 686-1, 586-1, and 586-2 revolvers.Product Warning, Popular Mechanics, January 1988, p. 11. ==References== ==External links== *Smith & Wesson Inc.
