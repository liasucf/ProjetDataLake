Michael was alleged to have caused the death of 28-year old Kanumba. The death was said to have occurred after Kanumba confronted Michael for talking to another man in front of him. Michael was arrested and stayed in remand for almost a year for investigation. Later, the charges were amended to involuntary manslaughter.
