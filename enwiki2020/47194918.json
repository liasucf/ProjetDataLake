    "text": "The 2015 season was Str\u00f8msgodset's 9th season in Tippeligaen following their promotion back to the top flight in 2006. David Nielsen started the season as the manager, but was sacked after league round 10, having only secured 12 points. He was replaced by assistant manager Bj\u00f8rn Petter Ingebretsen on 26 May 2015. Ingebretsen achieved immediate success, and took the team from 9th to 2nd after a 20-match run that secured 45 points. In the cup they were knocked out by 2. Divisjon side Kvik Halden on a penalty shootout in the third round. In the UEFA Europa League qualifications, they eliminated FK Partizani and FK Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav in the 1st and 2nd qualifying rounds, but lost 0\u20134 on aggregate versus Hajduk Split in the third qualifying round. ==Review and events== ===Pre-season transfers=== Three important players left in the winter transfer window, as well as several players who had been on loan spells. Former Ghana international Adam Larsen Kwarasey, who had been in the club since 2007, and was the first choice goalkeeper for the last five seasons, signed for Major League Soccer club Portland Timbers after his contract expired. He was replaced by the experienced former Norway international Espen Bugge Pettersen, who had become back-up goalkeeper at Molde in the two previous seasons. In defence, former Norway international Jarl Andr\u00e9 Storb\u00e6k, who had arrived mid-season in 2012 and been crucial to the title win in 2013, left the club after his contract expired, to become playing assistant manager for Nybergsund. He was replaced by French left back Florent Hanin, who had been released by Lierse. Most importantly, the hugely talented 16-year-old Norway international Martin \u00d8degaard was sold to Real Madrid for the record selling fee of 35 million NOK (which could rise to 70 million NOK). ===Pre- season=== Str\u00f8msgodset went on two training tours abroad. On 30 January, they played 0\u20130 in a Copa X match vs Dinamo Zagreb at La Manga, Murcia. On 6 February, they won 3\u20131 against Hammarby in the same cup and location. Next, the team moved to Belek, Turkey, where they played three friendlies. They won 2\u20131 against CSKA Sofia on 15 February, lost 0\u20131 to Spartak Moscow on 21 February and lost 1\u20133 to Torpedo Moscow on 25 February. In March, Str\u00f8msgodset played four friendlies on home soil against Norwegian teams. They lost 3\u20135 in an away match against Odd at Skagerak Arena on 6 March, having trailed 1\u20135 at half-time. On 14 March, they won 3\u20130 at home to newly promoted Sandefjord, and repeated the score against V\u00e5lerenga one week later, when Iver Fossum scored a hattrick. Their final pre-season friendly was a 2\u20131 away win at Lillestr\u00f8m. ===Season=== ====League==== Str\u00f8msgodset had a difficult start of the season, with away games at four of the best teams from the 2014 Tippeligaen in the first five away matches. They also hosted the long-awaited derby vs rivals Mj\u00f8ndalen IF in the first home game. After just one win in the first six rounds, Str\u00f8msgodset was at 13th place in the league. After two home wins and two away losses, manager David Nielsen was fired from his job, and assistant Bj\u00f8rn Petter Ingebretsen, also known as \u00abBP\u00bb, was hired as interim manager for the remainder of the season. Ingebretsen had more luck, and the team won five of their next six matches in the league, rising to 6th position in the table after half the season had been played. The team went undefeated for the eleven final games of the season, and secured the silver medals. ====Norwegian Cup==== In the cup, Str\u00f8msgodset easily won the First and Second Round matches against FK T\u00f8nsberg and Kjels\u00e5s Fotball, 5\u20130 and 4\u20130, respectively. After a goalless draw in the Third Round, Str\u00f8msgodset were surprisingly eliminated by Kvik Halden on a 2-4 penalty shootout. The latter club thus won its third match on penalties, and advanced to the Fourth Round, whereas Str\u00f8msgodset yet again failed to advance from the Third Round. ====Europe==== Through their 4th place in 2014 Tippeligaen, Str\u00f8msgodset had secured a spot in the first qualifying round of the 2015\u201316 UEFA Europa League. On 22 June 2015, Str\u00f8msgodset was drawn against Albanian club FK Partizani Tirana, who had qualified through their 3rd place in the 2014\u201315 Albanian Superliga. The original draw had the Albanians playing at home first, but this was reversed by UEFA due to security reasons. The first leg, played at home on 2 July, ended with a 3\u20131 win to Str\u00f8msgodset. The second leg ended with a 1\u20130 win for Str\u00f8msgodset, after a late goal by Petter Vaagan Moen. FK Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav awaited in the 2nd qualifying round. After a 2\u20131 win away, the 0\u20131 home defeat meant that Str\u00f8msgodset advanced to the third round on the away goals rule. They faced Hajduk Split, but were eliminated win 0\u20132 defeats both away and home. ==Match results== ===Legend=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |style=\"background- color: #CCFFCC;\"|Win |style=\"background-color: #FFFFCC;\"|Draw |style=\"background-color: #FFCCCC;\"|Loss |} ===Pre-Season=== ===Tippeligaen=== ==== League table ==== ===Norwegian Cup=== ===Europa League=== ==Player details== ==Transfers== ===Winter=== In: Out: ===Summer=== In: Out: ==Team kit== The official kit manufacturer for Str\u00f8msgodset is Diadora.
