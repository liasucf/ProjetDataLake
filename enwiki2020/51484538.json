    "text": "The Neales are a British, four part family harmony group made up of three brothers and their dad. The family band reached the Live Final of Britain's Got Talent 2015, famously moving Simon Cowell to shed a tear on live television with their emotional semi-final performance of Cat Stevens' Father & Son. In June 2016, The Neales released their self-penned debut single, 'I'll Be There', which entered the UK Official Music Charts at #22 in its first week, and knocked Adele off #1 in the Official UK Independent Singles Chart. During the following week, 'I'll Be There' peaked at #6 in the Official Music Charts' midweek update, before charting for a second week at #31. The Neales are made up of father Laurie Neale, and brothers James Neale, Dan Neale and Phil Neale. == References == Category:British musical groups Category:Britain's Got Talent contestants ",
