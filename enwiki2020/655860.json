    "text": "\"O Arise, All You Sons\" is the national anthem of Papua New Guinea. The 'National Identity Act' of Papua New Guinea was formed in 1971, motivating the country to create a national flag, a national emblem, a national pledge and a national anthem.National Identity Act 1971, http://www.paclii.org/pg/legis/consol_act/nia1971197. Retrieved 8 Oct 2018. The Papua New Guinean national flag and emblem were adopted in 1971. However, the National Anthem remained undecided until 1975, four years later. Although many songs were submitted to be the anthem, the National Executive Council decided a week before the country's Independence Day (10 September 1975), to adopt as the national anthem a composition that was composed by Chief Inspector Thomas Shacklady (1917\u20132006), a bandmaster of the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary Band.\"The national anthem of Papua New Guinea\", pngaa.net ==Lyrics== O arise all you sons of this land, Let us sing of our joy to be free, Praising God and rejoicing to be Papua New Guinea. Shout our name from the mountains to the seas Papua New Guinea; Let us raise our voices and proclaim Papua New Guinea. Now give thanks to the good Lord above For His kindness, His wisdom and love For this land of our fathers so free, Papua New Guinea. Shout again for the whole world to hear Papua New Guinea; We are independent and we're free Papua New Guinea. ==References== ==External links== *National anthem of Papua New Guinea, MIDI file *Link to MP3 file *Thomas Shacklady \u2013 Composer of Papua New Guinea's National Anthem Category:National anthems Category:Papua New Guinean music Category:National symbols of Papua New Guinea Category:Oceanian anthems Category:National anthem compositions in B-flat major ",
