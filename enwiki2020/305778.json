    "text": "M.A.S.K. (an acronym for Mobile Armored Strike Kommand) is a 1985-1986 animated television series produced by DIC Audiovisuel and ICC TV Productions, Ltd. The series was based on the M.A.S.K. action figures produced by Kenner Products. It was animated in Japan by studios; KK DiC Asia (later known as KK C&D; Asia), Studio Juno, Studio World, and Ashi Productions. ==Overview== M.A.S.K. is a special task force led by Matt Trakker, who operate transforming armored vehicles in their ongoing battle against the criminal organization V.E.N.O.M. (an acronym for Vicious Evil Network of Mayhem) with an emphasis on superpowered helmets (called \"masks\") worn by the characters of both factions. V.E.N.O.M.'s primary goal was obtaining money through either robbery, extortion, counterfeiting, kidnapping, or attempting to steal historical artifacts, but M.A.S.K. always found a way to foil their plans. ==Cast== * Doug Stone \u2013 Matt Trakker, Hondo MacLean, Dusty Hayes, Bruce Sato, Nash Gorey, Bruno Sheppard, Boris Bushkin, Maximus Mayhem * Brendan McKane \u2013 Miles Mayhem, Alex Sector, Floyd Malloy, Jacques LaFleur, Nevada Rushmore * Graeme McKenna \u2013 T-Bob, Brad Turner, Julio Lopez, Calhoun Burns * Mark Halloran \u2013 Sly Rax, Buddy Hawks, Cliff Dagger, Ace Riker, Duane Kennedy * Sharon Noble \u2013 M.A.S.K.

The first season consisted of 65 episodes, but the second season, whose theme centered around auto racing instead of crimefighting, lasted only ten episodes. ==Production== One of many cartoons produced during the 1980s as a vehicle for toy merchandising, M.A.S.K., was a hybrid of popular era cartoons G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero and The Transformers. When originally broadcast, M.A.S.K. was the first closed-captioned series to air in first-run syndication. ==Home video== Several episodes of the series were released under Karl-Lorimar's \"Kideo Video\" branding on VHS in the 1980s, with two episodes per tape. The \"racing\" second season was distributed by Tempest Video. In the United Kingdom, two releases titled M.A.S.K The Movie, and M.A.S.K The Movie II were released by Tempo Video, featuring episodes edited into a feature- length format. M.A.S.K. episodes have been released on DVD in three different regions. * USA: Shout! Factory acquired the Region 1 DVD rights and released a \"Complete Series\" set on August 9, 2011 containing only the episodes from the first season of the original series (65 episodes), as well as a separate 2-disc collection of the first 11 episodes, called \"Volume 1\" and released the same day. The second season, which consists of 10 episodes, are owned by Cookie Jar Entertainment and are not part of the acquisition. * UK: A single DVD set containing the first 5 episodes was released by Maximum Entertainment (under license from Jetix Europe) in August 2004. In November 2007, Maximum released Collection 1, containing the same number of episodes as the Australian set. Collection 1 was re-released on 31 August 2009, and Collection 2 was finally released on 28 September 2009. Both sets (the re-issue Collection 1 and Collection 2) are distributed through Lace DVD, replacing Maximum Entertainment, and both sets are in Region 2 PAL format. All 75 episodes were released across both sets. * Australia and New Zealand: Madman Entertainment released the complete series over two DVD collections for the first time in Australia and New Zealand. Collection 1 was released in November 2006 and contains episodes 1\u201338, Collection 2 was released in March 2007 and contains episodes 39\u201375 which includes the season 2 episodes. ==Reception== IGN voted M.A.S.K. the 99th-best animated series in 2009, calling it one of the most popular cartoon/toy marketing franchises of the 1980s, stating that it took many of the strengths of G.I. Joe and Transformers while taking few of their flaws. On the other hand, David Perlmutter in the 2018 The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows says, \"Given that it was tied into a toy line produced by co-producer Kenner-Parker, the intent was clearly to showcase the weaponry and vehicles at the expense of anything deeper in terms of plotting and characterization. That being said, the series did manage to do the little it was asked to provide in advertising the toys.\" ==In other media== On December 15, 2015, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Hasbro and Paramount were creating a movie universe combining Micronauts with G.I. Joe, Visionaries: Knights of the Magical Light, M.A.S.K. and Rom. The Hollywood Reporter reported on April 21, 2016 that Michael Chabon, Brian K. Vaughan, Nicole Perlman, Lindsey Beer, Cheo Coker, John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein, Joe Robert Cole, Jeff Pinkner, Nicole Riegel and Geneva Robertson- Dworet had joined the writers room. On April 18, 2018, it was announced that F. Gary Gray will direct the live-action movie. On February 28, 2020, Chris Bremner has been announced to pen the script. ==References== ==External links== * * * Albert Penello's MASK Page \u2013 M.A.S.K. toy information and database * Matt-Trakker.com \u2013 M.A.S.K. info website * Boulder-Hill.net \u2013 M.A.S.K. toy and merchandise information Category:1985 Canadian television series debuts Category:1986 Canadian television series endings Category:1980s Canadian animated television series Category:1980s Canadian science fiction television series Category:American children's animated action television series Category:American children's animated adventure television series Category:American children's animated science fiction television series Category:French children's animated action television series Category:French children's animated adventure television series Category:French children's animated science fiction television series Category:Television series by DIC Entertainment Category:Animated television series about robots Category:Fictional military organizations Category:Flying cars in fiction Category:Masks in fiction Category:Action figures Category:Television shows adapted into comics Category:Comics based on toys Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States Category:English-language television shows ",
