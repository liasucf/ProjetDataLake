He makes frequent appearances at conferences in gastronomy (some as Madrid Fusion), as well as presentations, demonstrations and master classes around the world. As a TV host he has a great success with the Spanish adaptation of the show Kitchen Nightmares titled Pesadilla en la cocina and Top Chef produced by Boomerang TV to Antena 3. ==Biography== At the age of 17, Chicote joined Escuela de hosteler\u00eda de Madrid in Casa de Campo Spain. During the nineties he worked in the kitchens of some famous restaurants of the time as Lucullus with Ange Garcia, Toni Sibaris Vicente and La Recoleta with Bethlehem Lagu\u00eda. After his apprenticeship in Switzerland he had the opportunity to meet Salvador Gallego who greatly influenced his cooking knowledge. For the next four years, he worked as the Chef of El Cenachero where he strengthened his career by making a new kind of Andalusian cuisine that earned him recognition and success. In 1987 he became the chef of the restaurant called NODE Benjamin Streets, with the aim of merging the Spanish cuisine with the Japanese cuisine. This project made him a pioneer of this type of cuisine in Spain. In 2006, he also began working as chef in the restaurant Pandelujo (same owner), a local with marked taste for aesthetics, where he mixed spaces and gastronomy, coordinating his position of executive chef of both restaurants. For a time he was responsible for the food section of the Sunday magazine of El Pa\u00eds. He also held for three years a section devoted to cuisine in the radio program of Toni Garrido in RNE known as Asuntos propios and multiple collaborations in the Media sector.
