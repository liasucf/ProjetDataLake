    "text": "Phenyl salicylate, or salol, is a chemical substance, which was synthesized first in 1883 by the Polish chemist and doctor Marceli Nencki (who didn't publish his findings) and then independently in 1885 by the German chemist Richard Seifert (de) (1861\u20131919) (who did publish his findings). It is synthesized by heating salicylic acid with phenol. Once used in sunscreens, phenyl salicylate is now used in the manufacture of some polymers, lacquers, adhesives, waxes, and polishes. Commonly it is used in school laboratory demonstrations on how cooling rates affect crystal size in igneous rocks. Can be used to demonstrate seed crystal selectiveness. Salol is also used as an internal antiseptic and as a mild analgesic.. ==Salol reaction== In the salol reaction, phenyl salicylate reacts with o-toluidine in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at elevated temperatures to the corresponding amide o-salicylotoluide. Salicylamides are one type of drug. ==Medical== It has been used as an antiseptic based on the antibacterial activity upon hydrolysis in the small intestine. It acts as a mild analgesic. == History == The Swiss physician Hermann Sahli (sometimes spelled \"Saly\") (1856\u20131933) sought a substitute for sodium salicylate, which was used as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis but which wasn't tolerated by some patients. So Dr. Sahli asked the Polish chemist and doctor Marceli Nencki of Bern, Switzerland if Nencki knew of a salicylate compound that lacked sodium salicylate's side effects.See: * From column 524: \"Das salicylsaure Natron ist zwar das verz\u00fcglichste Specificum \u2026 Dieser K\u00f6rper, welchen N. \"Salol\" nannte, \u2026 \" (Sodium salicylate is indeed the best remedy against acute rheumatoid arthritis; however, as is known, it's poorly tolerated by some patients who, after its use, suffer nausea, tinnitus, etc., occasionally even fainting spells. These inconveniences caused Dr. Sahli (La Semaine M\u00e9dicale [The Medical Week], no. 15, 14 April 1886 ; Allgemeine medizinische Central-Zeitung [General Medical Central Journal]) to inquire of Dr. Nencki whether he knew another salicylate compound that didn't have those drawbacks. Soon thereafter he received from Nencki a communication that he had succeeded in producing a compound in which an ether (phenol) had been substituted [for one of salicylic acid's hydrogen atoms], instead of a base [i.e., metal alkali]. This substance, which Nencki named \"Salol\", \u2026 ) * Reprinted in: * From pp.122\u2013123: \"Dans une communication faite \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de m\u00e9decine et de pharmacie de Berne, le docteur Sahli a fait ressortir les effets funestes produits sur l'estomac par un usage prolong\u00e9 du salicylate de soude. Pour parer \u00e0 cet inconv\u00e9nient, il s'est adress\u00e9 au professeur de Nencki, pour lui demander s'il n'y aurait pas possibilit\u00e9 de trouver une autre combinaison de l'acide salicylique. Le professeur de Nencki ayant \u00e9tudi\u00e9, il y a trois ans, les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s chimiques, physiologiques et surtout antiseptiques de salicylate de ph\u00e9nol ou salol, conseilla imm\u00e9diatement ce produit au docteur Sahli.\" (In a communication [that he] made to the Berne Society of Medicine and Pharmacy, Dr. Sahli highlighted the harmful effects [that are] produced on the stomach by the prolonged use of sodium salicylate. In order to deal with this drawback, he spoke to Prof. Nencki, in order to ask him if there wasn't a possibility of finding another compound of salicylic acid. Prof. Nencki, having studied, three years ago, the chemical, physiological, and above all antiseptic properties of phenyl salicylate or salol, immediately recommended this product to Dr. Sahli.) Nencki recommended phenyl salicylate, which he had synthesized circa 1883. This is the speech which Sahli made to the Berne Society of Medicine and Pharmacy, and in which he announced Salol and its use as a new pharmaceutical. From p. 321: \"Diese Verbindung war neben mehreren verwandten zusammengesetzten Aethern von Phenolen und org. S\u00e4uren von Nencki schon vor 3 Jahren dargestellt und auf seine antiseptischen und physiologisch-chemischen Eigenschaften untersucht worden, hat aber eine practische Anwendung bisher noch nicht gefunden.\" (In addition to several related esters composed of phenol and organic acids, this compound was prepared 3 years ago by Nencki and was investigated for its antiseptic and physiological-chemical properties; however, [he] hadn't yet found a practical application.) From p. 527: \"Salol was produced about three years ago by Professor Nencki, who also investigated its physiological properties.\" While Nencki had been investigating how phenyl salicylate behaved in the body, he hadn't published his findings.However, in 1885, Nencki did publish his findings about the hydrolysis, by the body, of esters. In particular, Nencki published his findings regarding the hydrolysis of phenyl benzoate (Phenolbenzoes\u00e4ureester), a compound that is chemically closely related to phenyl salicylate. See pp. 380-382 of: Meanwhile, the German chemist Richard Seifert (de) (1861\u20131919), a student of the German chemist Rudolf Wilhelm Schmitt (de) (1830\u20131898), From p. 241: \"Sein bekanntester Sch\u00fcler war Richard Seifert (1861-1919), der Chefchemiker der Fabrik v. Heydens, der u.a. 1892 die Rezeptur f\u00fcr das weltbekannte Mundwasser \"Odol\" entwickelte.\" (His [Schmitt's] best known pupil was Richard Seifert (1861-1919), the chief chemist of the Heyden factory, who, among others, developed in 1892 the formula for the world-famous mouthwash \"Odol\".) independently synthesized phenyl salicylate in 1885.See: * ; see: \"VII.

On p. 473, Seifert said that phenyl salicylate had not been synthesized previously: \"Das Phenylsalicylat ist noch nicht dargestellt worden.\" (Phenyl salicylate has not been prepared until now.) * English abstract: In 1885, Seifert accepted a position at the Heyden chemical corporation (de) of Radebeul, Germany, which manufactured salicylic acid.Arevipharma, Geschichter der chemischen Fabrik von Heyden: Vergr\u00f6sserung der Fabrik und Aufnahme wichtger neuer Pr\u00e4parate [History of the Heyden chemical factory: Expansion of the factory and addition of important new preparations] The United States granted to Nencki and Seifert a patent for the production of phenyl salicylate,Nencki, Marrel V. ; Seifert, Richard \"Production of salol\" U.S. Patent no. 350,012 (filed: 22 July 1886 ; issued: 28 September 1886). whereas Germany granted a patent for its production to Nencki and the Heyden corporation.
