    "text": "John F. Kennedy High School () is a public high school located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The school is operated by the English Montreal School Board. The current principal is Joseph Vitantonio, and the vice-principal is Sabrina Petrocco. Until 1998, it was operated by the Montreal Catholic School Commission.\"SECONDARY SCHOOLS\" (English). Montreal Catholic School Commission. January 20, 1998. Retrieved on August 4, 2016. == Academics == The academics are followed by the laws of the Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports. A student who fails math, English, or French must go to summer school. A students who fails all must repeat the school year. The mid-term exams take place in January, and the final exams take place in June. They are three types of courses enriched, regular, and special ed (the last only for secondary one and two). Enriched is for those who get above 75% the first half of the school year, and they learn academic in their level and the second half of the next level. Regular is for students who learn academics in their own level throughout their whole school year. Special ed is for those with learning disabilities and those who get lower than a 65% average. For students to graduate, they need 54 credits. Students can work hard and get credits in secondary three, four and five. ===Exams=== Exams are a part of academics. The mid-term and final exams each count for 30% of the grade and come from the English Montreal School Board except for secondary five exams, which comes from the Quebec government. In the new school year of 2011, a new report card got rid of term four in high school; the first and second terms each count for 20%, and the third counts as 60% at the end of the school year. The teacher calculates all the marks and see if children passed. The term exams are to see if the teacher taught well and everything necessary and if students know what they learned. ==Athletics== John F. Kennedy High School has soccer and basketball teams in the bantam (secondary 1-2), midget (secondary 2-3), and juvenile (secondary 4-5) divisions of the GMAA (Greater Montreal Area Athletics), for boys and girls except for bantam girl teams. Their teams regularly compete with other schools in the Greater Montreal Athletics Association(GMAA). The teams are the JFK Knights. The school also has a juvenile boys (secondary 4-5) badminton team and, since the beginning of the 2013\u20132014 academic school year, an ice hockey training camp. Every Tuesday, players in the training camp have an early dismissal at 2:30 to leave to go to the local public arena for practice ay Saint Michel Arena. Practice starts at 3:00 and ends at 4:30. The hockey camp is a division of the Ahunstic Braves. The training season ends in may. The camp is not part of the GMAA. The school also participates every year in April in the GMAA halo race on top of Mount Royal. For the whole month of April, participants need 16 kilometers of training. http://www.emsb.qc.ca/jfk/JFK/soccer.html == Asbestos== On May 9, 2012, principal Joseph Marra discovered suspected asbestos fibres in the two ventilation rooms in the school's basement. The next day, the fibres were tested, and the results were negative, but Marra closed the school for a week. Students were relocated to Rosemount High School until the cleanup had been completed. In July 2012, more fibres were found, and this time, test results were positive. Students and staff returned to the John F. Kennedy facility on May 25, 2013, after a year since the discovery of the asbestos fibres. They made the municipal news and media. The cost of the clean up is 2.8 million dollars, which sparked a lot of controversy at the school board. Originally, the cost was supposed to be 1.1 million dollars. ==See also== * List of memorials to John F. Kennedy ==References== ==External links== *John F.
