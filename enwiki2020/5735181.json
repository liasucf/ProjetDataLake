    "text": "Antonio das Mortes (, lit. \"The Dragon of Wickedness against the Holy Warrior\") is a 1969 Brazilian western film directed by Glauber Rocha. A sequel to Black God, White Devil, it features the return of the character Antonio das Mortes, now as the protagonist, again played by Maur\u00edcio do Valle. The original title is a reference to the tale of Saint George and the Dragon. ==Plot== After the World War II, in the Brazilian sert\u00e3o. A group of impoverished peasant mystics (beatos) gathered around Dona Santa (Rosa Maria Penna), a female spiritual figure, join in veneration of Saint George with an obscure figure named Coirana (Lorival Pariz). Coirana claims to have restarted the canga\u00e7o and seeks to take the revenge of Lampi\u00e3o and other cangaceiro martyrs, presenting the tale of Saint George and the Dragon in a contemporary class conflict context. They threaten the town of Jardim de Piranhas governed by Coronel Hor\u00e1cio (Joffre Soares) a blind and old cattle owner married to younger and attractive Laura (Odete Lara). Dr. Mattos (Hugo Carvana), the corrupt police chief of the town, hires Ant\u00f4nio das Mortes as a jagun\u00e7o against Coirana and Ant\u00f4nio fatally wounds Coirana in a duel. However, Ant\u00f4nio is changed by his experiences with the poor, and so he then demands that the coronel distribute the food stored in a warehouse to the remaining cangaceiros. The colonel raged and sent Mata Vaca (Vin\u00edcius Salvatori) to kill Ant\u00f4nio das Mortes. But Ant\u00f4nio das Mortes with the help of his friend \"Professor\" (Othon Bastos) kills Mata Vaca and his jagun\u00e7os. The coronel is killed by Ant\u00e3o (M\u00e1rio Gusm\u00e3o), the helper and possibly lover of Dona Santa in a scene reminiscent of Saint George slaying the Dragon iconography. The movie ends with Ant\u00f4nio das Mortes walking by the roadside, carrying on the struggle - in some ways hopeless or unending - which extends beyond the killing of the colonel and the expropriation of his land. ==Cast== * Maur\u00edcio do Valle - Ant\u00f4nio das Mortes * Odete Lara - Laura * Othon Bastos - Professor * Hugo Carvana - Dr. Mattos * Joffre Soares - Coronel Hor\u00e1cio * Lorival Pariz - Coirana * Rosa Maria Penna - Dona Santa * Vin\u00edcius Salvatori - Mata Vaca * M\u00e1rio Gusm\u00e3o - Ant\u00e3o * Emmanuel Cavalcanti - Priest * Santi Scaldaferri - Batista * Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Senna - Waitress * Paulo Lima ==Awards== Rocha won the award for Best Director at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival.
