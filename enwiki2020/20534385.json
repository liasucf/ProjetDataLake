    "text": "Norm Hitzges (born July 5, 1944) is an author and sports talk radio host at KTCK (1310 AM / 96.7 FM, \"SportsRadio 1310 The Ticket\") in Dallas, and a Texas Radio Hall of Fame member. Hitzges pioneered radio sports talk in the morning at KLIF radio at a time when sports talk was mainly on in the evening. Hitzges moved to (former rival) KTCK in early 2000 after 15 years at sister station KLIF when the latter removed sports talk programming from its lineup. Hitzges also serves as the television play-by-play voice of the Dallas Sidekicks. He has also provided major league baseball commentary for ESPN. Hitzges is known for his enthusiasm and knowledge of sports trivia and has been compared to Dick Vitale for his energy and love of sports. Hitzges has been honored by the Dallas All Sports Association and the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame. Hitzges also hosts \"Norm-A-Thon\", a yearly 18-hour marathon broadcast to raise money for the Austin Street Center, a Dallas area homeless shelter. Hitzges has also been a long-time supporter of Texans! Can Academy, an organization that provides at-risk youths with education and training. Weekly segments on his show include \u201cThe Birdhouse,\u201d \u201cShuttle Run,\u201d \u201cThe Meatheads of the Week,\u201d and \u201cThe Weekend-around.\u201d Since 2010, Hitzges and his wife have lived in the Dallas suburb of Little Elm, Texas. On August 7, 2020, Hitzges celebrated his 45th anniversary of sports talk radio. During a call-in, Mark Cuban related that Norm's KLIF show was the first radio program streamed on the internet on his original radio simulcast platform, AudioNet (later Broadcast.com). This required recording the show on an 8-hour VCR tape and then encoding the tapes onto a Packard-Bell PC to upload to the internet. On August 27, 2020, Hitzges announced on the air that he is being treated for bladder cancer. Notable DFW media members were quick to show their support, including Fox 4's Mike Doocy. ==Partial bibliography== * Horizons in the Mirror (1971, Naylor Co., ) * Norm Hitzges Historical Sports Almanac (May 1991, Taylor Publishing, ) * Essential Baseball: A Revolutionary New Method for Evaluating Major League Teams, Players, and Managers (with Dave Lawson, December 1994, Dutton, ) * Greatest Team Ever: The Dallas Cowboys Dynasty of The 1990s (August 2007, Thomas Nelson, ) ==References== ==External links== *Norm's Clubhouse *Norm Hitzges' entry on The Ticket website Category:Living people Category:1944 births Category:American sports announcers Category:Major League Baseball broadcasters Category:Radio personalities from Dallas Category:Sportswriters from New York (state) Category:Sportswriters from Texas Category:Texas Rangers (baseball) broadcasters Category:Dallas Cowboys broadcasters Category:People from Little Elm, Texas Category:Major Indoor Soccer League (1978\u20131992) commentators ",
