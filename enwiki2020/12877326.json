    "text": "Polyscias rodriguesiana (formerly Gastonia rodriguesiana, locally known as \"bois blanc\") is a rare species of plant in the family Araliaceae. ==Habitat== A small juvenile plant, growing in coastal coral sediments at Fran\u00e7ois Leguat Giant Tortoise and Cave Reserve. It is endemic to the island of Rodrigues, in Mauritius. It used to occur throughout Rodrigues island, but was especially common in coastal regions and on limestone or old coral sediments. It is now critically endangered. ==Description== \"Bois blanc\" can become tall and slender, when grown in deep shade, like this specimen in Grande Montagne Nature Reserve. It has a soft, swollen trunk and thick branches. It can reach a height of 6 meters, but is usually shorter and more compact. Its leaves are heterophyllous, like its close relative Polyscias maraisiana on Mauritius island to the west. Adult plants' leaves are shiny, rounded and bright green. ==References== rodriguesiana Category:Flora of Rodrigues Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
