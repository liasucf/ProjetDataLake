It is a large, evergreen tree, up to tall. At the time of the latest IUCN assessment in 1998, Myristica yunnanensis was only known from about 20 trees in two localities in Xishuangbanna in Yunnan; it was assessed as \"Critically Endangered\". However, later it has been found to have a somewhat broader distribution reaching Thailand and Vietnam too. The Vietnamese record is from the B\u1ebfn En National Park. ==References== yunnanensis Category:Critically endangered plants Category:Trees of China Category:Trees of Thailand Category:Trees of Vietnam Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Plants described in 1976 ",
