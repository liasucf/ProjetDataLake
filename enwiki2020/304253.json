It operates a spaceport at Alc\u00e2ntara, and a rocket launch site at Barreira do Inferno. The agency has given Brazil a role in space in South America and made Brazil a former partner for cooperation in the International Space Station.Brazilian Space Agency The Internet Encyclopedia of Science. Retrieved on 2009-07-29. The Brazilian Space Agency is the heir to Brazil's space program. Previously, the program had been under the control of the Brazilian military; the program was transferred into civilian control on 10 February 1994. It suffered a major setback in 2003, when a rocket explosion killed 21 technicians. Brazil successfully launched its first rocket into space on 23 October 2004 from the Alc\u00e2ntara Launch Center; it was a VSB-30 launched on a sub-orbital mission. Several other successful launches have followed.BBC World: Brazil Launches rocket into space BBC News. Retrieved on 2009-07-30.Space.com: Brazil completes successful rocket launch Space.com.

On March 30, 2006, AEB astronaut Marcos Pontes became the first Brazilian and the first native Portuguese-speaking person to go into space, where he stayed on the International Space Station for a week. During his trip, Pontes carried out eight experiments selected by the Brazilian Space Agency. These experiments included testing flight dynamics of saw blades in zero gravity environments, and attempting to \"tip over\" a table of space food\". He landed in Kazakhstan on April 8, 2006, with the crew of Expedition 12.BBC World: First Brazilian goes into space BBC News. Retrieved on 2009-07-30. The Brazilian Space Agency has pursued a policy of joint technological development with more advanced space programs. Initially, it relied heavily on the United States, but after meeting difficulties from them on technological transfers, Brazil has branched out, working with other nations, including China, India, Russia, and Ukraine. ==History== Technological Institute of Aeronautics (ITA). The Brazilian Space Agency's control room at the Alc\u00e2ntara Launch Center The then president J\u00e2nio Quadros in 1960 established a commission that elaborated a national program for the space exploration. As a result of this work, in August 1961, the Organization Group of the National Commission of Space Activities (Portuguese: Grupo de Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o da Comiss\u00e3o Nacional de Atividades Espaciais) was formed, operating in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. Its researchers participated in international projects in the areas of astronomy, geodesy, geomagnetism and meteorology. The GOCNAE was replaced in April 1971 by the Institute for Space Research, currently called the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). Since the creation of the then Technical Center of Aeronautics (CTA), the current Department of Aerospace Science and Technology (DCTA) of the Brazilian Air Force, in 1946, the country has been following the international progress in the aerospace sector. With the creation of the Technological Institute of Aeronautics (ITA), a fully qualified institution was formed to train highly qualified human resources in areas of state-of-the- art technology. The DCTA, through the ITA and the Institute of Aeronautics and Space (IAE), play a key role in the consolidation of the Brazilian space program. In the early 1970s, the Brazilian Space Activities Commission (COBAE) was created - a body linked to the then General Staff of the Armed Forces (EMFA) - to coordinate and monitor the implementation of the space program. This coordinating role, in February 1994, was transferred to the Brazilian Space Agency. The creation of the AEB represents a change in government orientation by establishing a central coordinating body for the space program, reporting directly to the Presidency of the Republic. In 2011 Argentina's defense minister, Arturo Puricelli, made a proposal to the Brazilian minister, Celso Amorim, for the creation of a unified South American space agency by the year 2025, according to the European Space Agency. In 2015, however, the Brazilian Space Agency and the Ministry of Defense rejected the Argentine proposal \"because it understood that it would be an organ that would yield a lot of bureaucracy and few results like the 'confederation' proposed by the United States and never came to anything\" and also because, according to the agency's adviser, \"A regional space agency would reverberate in the Brazilian pocket that, due to its territorial size, would end up getting most of the invoice to pay\". ==Launch sites== VLS1-V03 rocket on a launching pad from Alc\u00e2ntara Launch Center. ===Alc\u00e2ntara Launch Center=== The Alc\u00e2ntara Launch Center (; CLA) is the main launch site and operational center of the Brazilian Space Agency.Centros de Lan\u00e7amentos: CLA Brazilian Space Agency.

Retrieved on 2009-07-30. This region presents some excellent requirements, such as low population density, excellent security conditions and easiness of aerial and maritime access. The most important factor is its closeness to the Equator - Alc\u00e2ntara is the closest launching base to the Equator. This gives the launch site a significant advantage in launching geosynchronous satellites. ===Barreira do Inferno Launch Center=== The Barreira do Inferno Launch Center (; CLBI) is a rocket launch base of the Brazilian Space Agency.Barreira do Inferno Launch Center GlobalSecurity.org.

The first 3 prototypes for the vehicle failed to launch, with the 3rd exploding on the launch pad in 2003 resulting in the deaths of 21 AEB personnel.

The first stage of the VLS Gama, Delta and Epsilon rockets was to be powered by a unit based on the RD-191 engine. The second stage, which will be the same for all the Southern Cross rockets, will be driven by an engine based on the Molniya rocket. The third stage will be a solid-propellant booster based on an upgraded version of the VLS-1. The program was named \"Southern Cross\" in reference to the Crux constellation, present on the flag of Brazil and composed of five stars.Programa de Ve\u00edculos Lan\u00e7adoeres de Sat\u00e9lites Cruzeiro do Sul Brazilian General Command for Aerospace Technology.

As a direct modification of the VLS-1 of the original project, replacing the fourth and fifth stages by a single liquid fuel engine. It can place payloads in the range 200\u2013400 kg in orbits up to 750 km. *VLS Beta (light-weight rocket) Consisting of three stages without auxiliary thrusters. The first stage is a solid fuel propellant 40 tons, the second will have 30 tons of thrust engine and the latter will be 7.5 tons of thrust, with the same mixture \"Kerolox\". It can place payloads up to 800 kg in orbits up to 800 km. *VLS Gama (light-weight rocket) The VLS Gama launcher is part of the light-weight class, but using the near-equatorial position of the Alc\u00e2ntara Launch Center, it can place almost 1 ton of payload into orbit up to 800 km. *VLS Delta (medium-weight rocket) The VLS Delta launcher is a medium-weight rocket and differs from the Gamma by having four solid-propellant boosters attached to the first stage. Its payload deliverable to a geostationary orbit is 2 tons. *VLS Epsilon (heavy-weight rocket) The VLS Epsilon launcher is a heavy-weight rocket with three identical units attached to the first stage. It can place a 4 tons spacecraft in geostationary orbit, if it is launched from Alc\u00e2ntara. The Brazilian government was planning to allocate $1 billion dollars for the project over six years. It has already set aside $650 million for the construction of five launch pads able to handle up to 12 launches per year. The program was scheduled to be completed by 2022. However, it was cancelled by Brazilian President Dilma Rouseff. Instead, Brazil will focus on a series of smaller launch vehicles that appear to rely more on home-grown technology. ==Engines== Part of the satellite testing facility at the National Institute for Space Research.
