    "text": "The 1934 NFL season was the 15th regular season of the National Football League. Before the season, the Portsmouth Spartans moved from Ohio to Detroit, Michigan, and were renamed the Detroit Lions. The Cincinnati Reds lost their first eight games, then were suspended for not paying league dues. The St. Louis Gunners, an independent team, played the last 3 games of the season for the Reds. The Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy was established as the league's award for the NFL champion, and was awarded through 1967. The host team for the NFL Championship Game would now alternate between the two divisions, with the Eastern Division champion hosting in even-numbered years, and the Western champion hosting in odd-numbered years. The season ended with the NFL Championship Game when the New York Giants defeated the Chicago Bears at the Polo Grounds in what has become known as the \"Sneakers Game\". ==Major rule changes== *A hand-to-hand forward pass made behind the line of scrimmage that becomes incomplete (hits the ground before it is caught) is to be ruled as a fumble. *Incomplete passes no longer result in a five-yard penalty ==Final standings== P = Games Played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, PCT= Winning Percentage, PF= Points For, PA = Points Against {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" | colspan=\"8\" align=\"center\" | Eastern Division |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" !Team!!P!!W!!L!!T!!PCT!!PF!!PA |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| New York Giants |13||8||5||0||.615||147||107 |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| Boston Redskins |12||6||6||0||.500||107||94 |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| Brooklyn Dodgers |11||4||7||0||.364||61||153 |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| Philadelphia Eagles |11||4||7||0||.364||127||85 |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| Pittsburgh Pirates |12||2||10||0||.167||51||206 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\" | colspan=\"8\" align=\"center\" | Western Division |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" !Team!!P!!W!!L!!T!!PCT!!PF!!PA |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| Chicago Bears |13||13||0||0||1.000||286||86 |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| Detroit Lions |13||10||3||0||.769||238||59 |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| Green Bay Packers |13||7||6||0||.538||156||112 |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| Chicago Cardinals |11||5||6||0||.455||80||84 |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| St. Louis Gunners |3||1||2||0||.333||27||61 |- align=\"center\" |align=\"left\"| Cincinnati Reds |8||0||8||0||.000||10||243 |} ==NFL Championship Game== N.Y.
