    "text": "Cuanman () was originally an ethnic group in northern Yunnan, China. They came into power after assisting Zhuge Liang's Southern Campaign and dominated Yunnan during the Northern and Southern dynasties period. According to the tomb tablet of Cuan Longyan, they were descended from a famous official in Shanxi, however it was common at the time to create fictitious lineages linking indigenous elites back to China, and it's also highly likely that the Cuans were originally native to Yunnan. In 570, the Cuan ruler, Cuan Zan, divided his realm in half between the east, known as Wuman/Black Mywa (\u70cf\u883b), ruled by his son Cuan Zhen, and the west, known as Baiman/White Mywa (\u767d\u883b), ruled by his eldest son Cuan Wan. Cuan power was broken in 602 by the Sui dynasty. In 737, during the Tang dynasty, Piluoge of the Wuman tribe, Mengshe, united the Wuman tribes and founded Nanzhao (\u5357\u8a54).https://medium.com/@diantnam/the-great-diantnam-248e2d4b6658 ==Rulers== *Cuan Xi 231 *Cuan Gu 265 *Cuan Liang 327-330 *Cuan Chen 330-340 *Cuan Wei 345 *Cuan Baozi 405 *Cuan Longyan 445 *Cuan Yun 514 *Cuan Zan 548 ===Baiman (White Mywa)=== *Cuan Wan *Cuan Hongda *Cuan Guiwang *Acha (Guiwang's wife as regent) *Cuan Shouyu ===Wuman (Black Mywa)=== *Cuan Zhen *Cuan Qianfu *Cuan Sishao *Cuan Rijin *Cuan Chongdao *Cuan Fuchao ==References== ==Bibliography== * * Category:Tang dynasty people Category:History of China ",
