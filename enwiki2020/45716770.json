    "text": "Demolition Records was a British record label based in Jarrow, England, specialising in heavy metal and rock, with many international artists. It was founded in 2000 by brothers Ged and Eric Cook. There were also distribution offices in Frankfurt, Manhattan, and Tokyo. In 2007, the label was later rumoured to be signing ZZ Top and Whitesnake, which would greatly increase their sales, but the rumours were quickly dismissed. They also operated the sublabel DR2. ==Roster== * Hanoi Rocks * Lauren Harris * Glenn Hughes * McQueen * Painmuseum * Quiet Riot * The Quireboys * David Lee Roth * Sacred Sin * Skyclad * The Sound Ex * Spike * Temple of Brutality * Tigertailz (from 2006) * Therapy? * Twisted Sister * Vixen * W.A.S.P. * Y&T; ==See also== * List of record labels ==References== ==External links== * Demolition Records US Official MySpace Page * Demolition Records at discogs Category:British record labels Category:Rock record labels ",
