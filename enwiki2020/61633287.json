    "text": "Nat Puff (born June 18, 1996), better known by her stage name Left at London (sometimes stylized as /@/), is an American singer-songwriter, producer, comedian, and internet personality from Seattle, Washington. She has posted short comedy sketches on Vine, as well as parodies of musicians Frank Ocean, Tyler, the Creator, and Mitski on Twitter. ==Career== Puff first began writing songs in fifth grade. She began posting short videos on Vine in 2014. In 2018, she released The Purple Heart and Transgender Street Legend Vol. 1. In that year, she started gaining online attention thanks to the success of her viral Twitter video titled \"How to Make a Frank Ocean Song\". In 2019, additional parodies of Tyler, the Creator and Mitski further popularized Left at London, including recognition from both artists. The Left at London project originally started as a band, though after the project fell apart Puff kept the previous group's monicker as her stage name, as she was uncomfortable using her legal name. The name Left at London comes from an experience where Puff misread a sign saying \"loft at tandem\". In 2014 and 2015, Puff released three demo EPs, Youth Group Computer, 2 Rowdy 4 Dennys / Give Peace a Break, and Will Write Songs 4 Money, all receiving very limited releases. Puff released her first widely-released extended play, The Purple Heart on June 18, 2018. That same year Transgender Street Legend, Vol. 1 was released. The later EP featured her breakout single \"Revolution Lover\" which went on to receive a music video and featured in an episode of Welcome to Night Vale. In December 2019 puff released the Dylan Brady-produced \"6 Feet\", the first single from Transgender Street Legend, Vol. 2. \"Blacknwhite (Radio Edit)\" was released On January 14, 2020 as the lead single to her forthcoming debut studio album You Are Not Alone Enough, an album themed around her mental health. On March 17, 2020, Puff released You Wouldn't Download a Car, a mixtape of her own remixes of various popular songs. On July 20, 2020 she released the two song EP Jenny Durkan, Resign in Disgrace. The EP's title refers to Jenny Durkan, the current mayor of Seattle, who [Puff] holds responsible for condoning police violence and causing \"the citizens of a historically gay neighborhood to be gassed on the first day of Pride Month.\" The songs on the EP were also inspired by the establishment of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone and the murders of Cherleena Lyles and Summer Taylor. The first track \"Do You See Us?\" appears on Transgender Street Legend, Vol. 2. That same week on July 24 she released the four-track covers EP This One's For the Milfs, featuring covers of songs by Janelle Monae, Billie Eilish, Ginuwine, and Kanye West. A day later Tales From Transgender Street, an album of Left at London covers by other artists, was released and promoted through a virtual concert of the same name. Transgender Street Legend, Vol. 2 was released on September 25, 2020. She confirmed in an interview that a third volume of the series is forthcoming. On September 29, 2020, Puff announced that she was working on new music part of a new duo called WOW OK. ==Personal life== Puff is a lesbian and a non-binary trans woman who uses she/her pronouns. She has been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and OSDD-1b. She says that her autism is what allows her to be so good at impressions, saying \"I'm used to mimicking others in order to seem neurotypical and I\u2019ve gotten really adept at observing things like speech patterns\". ==Discography== ===Albums=== ====Studio album==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:11em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:25em;\" | Album details |- ! scope=\"row\" | You Are Not Alone Enough | *Released: TBA |} ====Mixtape==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:11em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:25em;\" | Album details |- ! scope=\"row\" | You Wouldn't Download A Car | *Released: March 17, 2020 *Label: Self-released *Format: Digital download |} ====Tribute album==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:11em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:25em;\" | Album details |- ! scope=\"row\" | Tales From Transgender Street | *Released: July 25, 2020 *Label: Self-released *Format: Digital download |} ===Extended plays=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:11em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:25em;\" | Album details |- ! scope=\"row\" | Youth Group Computer | *Released: January 3, 2014 *Label: Self- released *Format: CD, digital download |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2 Rowdy 4 Dennys / Give Peace a Break | *Released: October 1, 2014 *Label: Self-released *Format: Cassette, streaming |- ! scope=\"row\" | Will Write Songs 4 Money | *Released: April 12, 2015 *Label: Self-released *Format: CD, digital download |- ! scope=\"row\" | The Purple Heart | *Released: June 18, 2018 *Label: Self- released *Format: Vinyl, digital download |- ! scope=\"row\" | Transgender Street Legend, Vol. 1 | *Released: November 10, 2018 *Label: Self-released *Format: Vinyl, digital download |- ! scope=\"row\" | Jenny Durkan, Resign in Disgrace | *Released: July 20, 2020 *Label: Self-released *Format: Digital download |- ! scope=\"row\" | This One's For the Milfs | *Released: July 24, 2020 *Label: Self-released *Format: Digital download |- ! scope=\"row\" | Transgender Street Legend, Vol. 2 | *Released: September 25, 2020 *Label: Self-released *Format: Digital download |} ===Singles=== ====As lead artist==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3.5em;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\"| Album |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"I Don't Trust U Anymore\" | 2017 | rowspan=\"2\"| Transgender Street Legend, Vol. 1 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Revolution Lover\" | 2018 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Oh, Maker\" | rowspan=\"3\"| 2019 | This One's For the Milfs |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"6 Feet\" | Transgender Street Legend, Vol. 2 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Santa's Homophobic\" (featuring Dominique \"SonicFox\" McLean and SungWon Cho) | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Blacknwhite (Radio Edit)\" | rowspan=\"4\"| 2020 | You Are Not Alone Enough |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Do You See Us?\" (featuring Nobi) | Jenny Durkan, Resign in Disgrace and Transgender Street Legend, Vol. 2 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Safety First\" (featuring Vera Much) | rowspan=\"2\"| Transgender Street Legend, Vol. 2 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"T-Shirt\" |} ===Guest appearances=== * Gerard David Millman - \"How Long?\" (2019) * Yung Skrrt - \"Where Did I Go?\" (2020) * Vera Much - \"Mortifying Ideal of Being Known\" (2020) ===Songwriting credits=== *\"Dumb Bitch Juice\" - Alice Longyu Gao (2019) *\"Pushing Boulders\" - Yesterday's Analog Earth Band (2019) *\"Semiautomatic (demo)\" - William Crooks (2020) ==References== ==External links== * Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:American indie pop musicians Category:Musicians from Seattle Category:Non-binary musicians Category:Transgender and transsexual musicians Category:Transgender and transsexual women Category:LGBT musicians from the United States Category:LGBT people from Washington (state) Category:LGBT singers Category:Lesbian musicians Category:People on the autism spectrum Category:Transgender non-binary people Category:LGBT comedians Category:People with post-traumatic stress disorder Category:People with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Category:People with borderline personality disorder Category:People with dissociative disorder Category:Vine celebrities Category:Record producers from Washington (state) Category:Lo-fi musicians Cateogry:LGBT record producers Category:Chillwave musicians ",
