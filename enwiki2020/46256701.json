He later started several small businesses in the Johnson County area. ===Transparency=== In 2018, Ryckman instituted a new set of rules to end the century-old practice of the anonymous introduction of bills in the Kansas House. Any individuals including legislator, lobbyist, advocate, or organization that request the introduction of legislation is now posted publicly and visibly on the Legislature's website. This change was made in effort to improve transparency within the Legislative Branch. ===Welfare Reform=== In 2013, Ryckman sponsored legislation to require welfare recipients undergo drug testing. Specifically, only individuals who are suspected of using illegal drugs would be required to be tested. Any individual who is tested and fails to qualify can request a second test, and can be reimbursed for that test. This legislation was signed into law by Governor Sam Brownback in April of that year. ==Personal life== Ryckman was born and raised in Meade, Kansas, and later attended MidAmerica Nazarene University as a student athlete.
