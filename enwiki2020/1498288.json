    "text": "Breca (sometimes spelled Breoca or Brecca) was a Bronding who, according to the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, was Beowulf's childhood friend. Breca defeated Beowulf in what, by consensus,R.D. Fulk, \u201cAfloat in Semantic Space: Old English sund and the Nature of Beowulf\u2019s Exploit with Breca\u00cf, Journal of English & Germanic Philology, vol.104, nr.4 (Oct. 2005) p.458. is described as a swimming match. While dining, Unferth alludes to the story of their contest as a reproach to Beowulf's impulsiveness and foolhardiness, and Beowulf then relates it in detail, explaining how he needed to stop and defeat multiple sea monsters (nicors) during the match, so, although he arrived at the goal after Breca, his was the more worthy journey. In line 522 of Beowulf, Breca is identified as lond Brondinga (\u201cof the Brondings\u2019 land\"). Breca is also mentioned in Widsith, an Anglo-Saxon poem (also known, usually by the translations of Benjamin Thorpe, as The Sk\u00f4p, or The Gleema's Tale, or The Skald's Tale) known only from a 10th-century copy, as the ruler (in some unspecified previous century) of the Brondings (line 25 of Widsith): :: Cassere weold Creacum, ond Caelic Finnum, ... Caesar rules the Greeks, and Caelic the Finns, ... :: Meaca Myrgingum, Mearchealf Hundingum, Meaca the Myrinings, Marchalf the Hundings, :: \u00feeodric weold Froncum, \u00feyle Rondingum, Theodoric ruled the Franks, Thyle the Rondings, :: Breoca Brondingum, Billing Wernum, ..... Breca the Brondings, Billing the Wernas, ..... This is presumably the same Breca as mentioned in Beowulf. In Beowulf, Breca is further identified, in line 524, as sunu B\u0113anst\u0101nes (\u201cBeanstan\u2019s son\u201d), as if the name Breca and the mention of Beanstan would be familiar enough to Unferth's audience to adequately identify him (although Beanstan is not otherwise mentioned in any surviving documentTom Shippey, \u201cNames in Beowulf and Anglo-Saxon England\u201d, in Leonard Neidorf, ed., The Dating of Beowulf: A Reassment (2014, Suffolk, UK, D.S. Brewer) pp.63-64. ). It was long ago theorized that the Brondings and Breca lived on the island of Br\u00e4nn\u00f6 outside of modern Gothenburg (the second largest city in Sweden).Benjamine Thorpe, Codex Exoniensis: A Collection of Anglo-Saxon Poetry with an English Translation (1842, London, Society of Antiquaries of London) p.514; R.W. Chambers, Widsith: A Study in Old English Heroic Legend (1912, Cambridge Univ. Press) p.111. On the other hand, from the mention in Widsith, with the Brondings mentioned immediately before the Wernas (and the Wernas supposedly being the Varini on the Elbe), it has been suggested that the Brondings might have located near them, perhaps in Mecklenburg or Pomerania.Thomas Arnold, Notes on Beowulf (1898, London, Longmans, Green & Co.) p.61. It has even been suggested that the Brondings, whose name suggests the crashing of waves, are entirely mythical.R.W. Chambers, Widsith: A Study in Old English Heroic Legend (1912, Cambridge Univ. Press) p.111. ==The nature of the contest== Some scholars have debated whether Beowulf and Breca competed in a swimming match or a rowing match. Ambiguities in the translation of Beowulf have left scholars with multiple interpretations for the Beowulf-Breca \u201cswimming\u201d episode. Karl P. Wentersdorf of Xavier University writes, \u201cAn adventure in which two youths spend seven days and nights swimming at sea is more than extraordinary, particularly since they are carrying heavy iron swords and wearing cumbersome coats of chain mail.\u201dKarl P. Wentersdorf, \u201cBeowulf\u2019s Adventure with Breca\u201d, Studies in Philology 72, no. 2 (spring 1975) p.141; James W. Earl, \u201cBeowulf\u2019s Rowing-Match\u201d, Neophilogus, vol.63, nr.2 (April 1979) p.285. Such a remarkable feat would not, however, be very incongruous with the poem's other portrayals of Beowulf's heroic prowess. Unferth describes this as a foolhardy contest or race, but when Beowulf offers his own version of events, it becomes a youthful confidence-building or team- building shared challenge, much like a camping or mountaineering trip, in which the two participants endeavored to stay together rather than one leave the other far behind. According to Wentersdorf, the trouble with translation \u201cresults from the ambiguity of the word sund in the lines ymb sund flite (line 508) and he \u00feeaet sunde oferflat (lines 517-518).\u201dKarl P. Wentersdorf, \u201cBeowulf\u2019s Adventure with Breca\u201d, Studies in Philology 72, no.2 (spring 1975) p.155; it has been suggested, e.g. by Roberta Frank, that the ambiguity is deliberate. R.D. Funk, Robert E. Bjork, & John D. Niles, Klaeber's Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburg (4th ed. 2008, Univ. of Toronto) p.152. Sund, though often translated by scholars as \u201cswim\u201d could, through evolution of language, be interpreted as \u201crowing\u201d.Karl P. Wentersdorf, \u201cBeowulf\u2019s Adventure with Breca,\u201d Studies in Philology, 72, no.2 (spring 1975) p.159; James W. Earl, \"Beowulf's Rowing-Match\", Neophilogus, vol.63, nr.2 (April 1979) p.286. Beowulf and Breca could have been rowing together or competing to see who was the more prodigious rower. The Old English term r\u0113on, used twice in this portion of Beowulf (namely lines 513 and 540), is not translated as \u201cswim\u201d in any other Anglo-Saxon poetry.Karl P. Wentersdorf, \u201cBeowulf\u2019s Adventure with Breca\u201d, Studies in Philology, 72, no.2 (spring 1975) p.159; Scott Gwara, Heroic Identity in the World of Beowulf (2008, Leiden, Netherlands, Brill) p.124. The kennings earmum \u00feehton (line 514, \u00feeccean \u201cto cover, conceal\u201d) and mundum brugdon (line 515a, bregdan \u201cto pull, move quickly, swing, draw\u201d), used by Unferth to describe Beowulf's match against Breca, are applicable to both swimming and rowing.Karl P. Wentersdorf, \u201cBeowulf\u2019s Adventure with Breca\u201d, Studies in Philology, 72, no.2 (spring 1975) p.160; R.D. Fulk, \u201cAfloat in Semantic Space: Old English sund and the Nature of Beowulf\u2019s Exploit with Breca\u201d, Journal of English & Germanic Philology, vol.104, nr.4 (Oct. 2005) p.460. Twice in this portion (lines 514 and 540) that sund is used is in the same lines as r\u0113on, and both times forming the three-word phrase on sund r\u0113on, which would seem to mean \"rowing on the sea\"In Frederick M. Biggs, \u201cBeowulf\u2019s Fight with the Nine Nicors\u201d, Review of English Studies, vol.53 n.s., nr.211 (2002) p.312, these are considered to be an \u201cunambiguous reference to rowing\u201d; also James W. Earl, \u201cBeowulf\u2019s Rowing-Match\u201d, Neophilogus, vol.63, nr.2 (April 1979) p.286; William Nelles, \u201cBeowulf\u2019s Sorhfullne Si\u00f0 with Breca\u201d, Neophilologus, vol.83 nr.2 (April 1999) pages 299-303. - but there is an Anglo-Saxon word, onsund, which means \u201csound, physically strong, uninjured\u201d, in most transcriptions of the Beowulf text it does not occur, but in the original manuscript, at line 513 on and sund have apparently been rewritten after being scraped from the parchment and seem slightly closer together than two separate words ordinarily are (although Zupitza's transcription treats them as two separate words), and in line 540 the manuscript clearly uses onsund as a single word and Zupitza transcribes it as a single word - although he drew a thin line of separation after on, which may indicate that he did not know that onsund was a word with a meaning of its own.Stephen Marino, \u201cBeowulf\u201d, The Explicator, vol.54, nr.4 (Summer 1996) p.195, referring to Julius Zupitza, Beowulf, Autotypes of the Unique Cotton MS. Vitellius Axv in the British Museum, with a Transcription and Notes (1882, London, Early English Text Society) pages 25-26 and the photographs facing those pages. The line numbers assigned by Zapitza are used throughout this article. Onsund is found in a lot of other Anglo-Saxon artifacts.Joseph Bosworth, An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary, edited & enlarged by T. Northcote Toller (1882, Oxford, Clarendon Press) vol.1, p.759, s.v. on-sund. In Icelandic, at least, sund requires a preposition, not found here in Beowulf, to mean swimming rather than merely something aquatic.James W. Earl, \u201cBeowulf\u2019s Rowing-Match\u201d, Neophilogus, vol.63, nr.2 (April 1979) p.287. Unferth also uses the phrases wada cunnedon (line 509), \u201cmade trial of the waters\u201d, and glidon ofer garsecg (line 515), \u201cglided over the sea\u201d during his description of Beowulf's match against Breca.Karl P. Wentersdorf, \u201cBeowulf\u2019s Adventure with Breca,\u201d Studies in Philology, 72, no.2 (spring 1975) p.161. Both terms are equally applicable to swimming and rowing. Rowing was, as much as swimming or water-wrestling, an essential skill for warriors during the Anglo-Saxon era, so a rowing competition between Beowulf and Breca would not have been out of the question. Although there are Nordic tales of swimming competitions, no other has characteristics of such extreme duration and danger as this - which, strictly speaking, was not a race but merely a testing of their own strength.Martin Puhvel, \"The Aquatic Contest in Halfdanar Saga Bronufostra and Beowulf's Adventure with Breca\", Neuphilologische Mitteilungen, vol.99, nr. 2 (1998) p.131 et seq.; James W. Earl, \"Beowulf's Rowing-Match\", Neophilogus, vol. 63, nr. 2 (April 1979) pp.287-288; Peter A. Jorgensen, \"Beowulf's Swimming Contest with Breca: Old Norse Parallels\", Folklore, vol.89 nr.1 (1978) p.52 et seq.; Karl P. Wentersdorf, \u201cBeowulf\u2019s Adventure with Breca,\u201d Studies in Philology 72, no. 2 (spring 1975) p.140 et seq. Moreover, the duration of the challenge seems to make rowing more likely than swimming; seven days and nights immersed in Scandinavian waters, in winter no less (line 516), evidently without food nor an opportunity to go ashore for sleep or warmth, seems lethal (and certainly more arduous than Diana Nyad\u2019s five attempts - only the last one successful - to swim from Cuba to Miami, each effort lasting only 2\u00bd days). Additionally, the text refers to Beowulf as fleotan (line 543) - \u201cfloating\u201d,William Nelles, \u201cBeowulf\u2019s Sorhfullne Si\u00f0 with Breca\u201d, Neophilologus, vol.83 nr.2 (April 1999) page 300. and being on sidne s\u00e6 (line 508), and on de\u00f3p w\u00e6ter (line 510) - \u201cupon the wide sea\u201d and \u201cupon the deep water\u201d and similar expressions\u2014putting him consistently atop or above the water, rather than in or under the water. In line 515, he is described as having glidon ofer garsecg - \u201cglided over / above the surf\u201d; again, an image more in keeping with rowing than swimming. Further, in line 581, fatigued from his struggles with the sea monsters, Beowulf was carried by the currents to the land of the Finns (presumably a great distance) - and here the original manuscript's text clearlyVery clearly. Julius Zupitza, Beowulf, Autotypes of the Unique Cotton MS. Vitellius Axv in the British Museum, with a Transcription and Notes (1882, London, Early English Text Society), after providing both a photograph and printed transcript of the manuscript page, says for the reading wudu weallendu, \u201cwudu, not wadu, without the least doubt; an a open at the top does not occur so late in English MSS.\u201d (p.28); and quoted by Fred C. Robinson, \u201cElements of the Marvelous in the Characterization of Beowulf: A Reconsideration of the Evidence\u201d, in Peter S. Baker, ed., The Beowulf Reader (2000, NY, Routledge) page 94. reads wudu weallendu - wudu, a word related to \u201cwood\u201d and often meaning \u201cboat\u201d (or perhaps \u201craft\u201d), as it does in lines 216, 298 and elsewhere, so that Beowulf was carried to the Finns on a tossing, quaking boat;James W. Earl, \u201cBeowulf\u2019s Rowing-Match\u201d, Neophilogus, vol.63, nr.2 (April 1979) p.286; Frederick M. Biggs, \u201cBeowulf\u2019s Fight with the Nine Nicors\u201d, Review of English Studies, vol.53 n.s., nr.211 (2002) p.313, not necessarily the boat he started with, but perhaps a raft or boat found or hastily constructed after his struggle with the sea monsters. however, several editors and translators saw an obscure difficulty (between the masculine wudu and the neuter weallendu) and insisted on changing the wudu (\u201cboat\u201d) to wadu (\u201cwater\u201d), making it appear that Beowulf was carried to the Finns on \u201csurging water\u201d (and, naturally, translators relying on the printed Anglo-Saxon text worked up by such editors were innocently led to the same result).R.D. Fulk, \u201cAfloat in Semantic Space: Old English sund and the Nature of Beowulf\u2019s Exploit with Breca\u201d, Journal of English & Germanic Philology, vol.104, nr.4 (Oct. 2005) pp.463-464; James W. Earl, \u201cBeowulf\u2019s Rowing-Match\u201d, Neophilogus, vol.63, nr.2 (April 1979) p.286; Karl P. Wentersdorf, \u201cBeowulf\u2019s Adventure with Breca\u201d, Studies in Philology, 72, no.2 (spring 1975) p.162; Frederick M.

First, we are introduced to Unferth, evidently a significant member of Hrothgar's court, but we are immediately encouraged to dislike him, because we are told he is motivated by envy and wishes to embarrass Hrothgar's honored guest. Second, it enables the introduction of a separate story (coming before the confrontation with Grendel) attesting, after a fashion, to Beowulf's strength, courage, and resourcefulness. Third, it tells us that Beowulf has already overcome monsters other than Grendel - several of them - so that he is suited for the challenge he faces. When he tells his side of the story, Beowulf manages to include some rude rebuffs to Unferth (the mention of Unferth killing his kin may be nothing more than slanging, just as modern American patois uses an accusation of \u2018a particular form of incest\u2019). Further in the saga, when Heriot is being attacked by Grendel's Mother, we shall see Unferth approach Beowulf in humility, offering his own family's heirloom sword. ==In popular culture== * Breca appears as a main character, portrayed by G\u00edsli \u00d6rn Gar\u00f0arsson, in Beowulf: Return to the Shieldlands, which depicts him and Beowulf as having become companions as adults after Beowulf saved Breca from a lynch mob. == Notes == Category:English heroic legends Breca Category:Literary characters ",
