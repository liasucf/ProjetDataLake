    "text": "The Israeli football league system is a series of interconnected leagues for club football in Israel. The system has a hierarchical format with promotion and relegation between leagues at different levels, and allows even the smallest club to dream of rising to the very top of the system. There are five levels, containing a total of 16 divisions. It is run by the Israel Football Association (IFA). ==Structure== The top division of Israeli football is the Premier League. Liga Leumit is the second tier. These two divisions all operate at the national level. Below Liga Leumit the divisions are split into regionalised leagues. Liga Alef is the third tier, and is split into north and south divisions. Liga Bet, the fourth tier, is divided into four regionalised leagues. Liga Gimel, the bottom division of Israeli football, is split into eight regionalised leagues.League details Israel Football Association {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" width=\"4.6%\" align=\"center\"|Level ! colspan=\"16\" width=\"95.4%\" align=\"center\"|League/Division(s) |- | colspan=\"2\" width=\"4.6%\" align=\"center\" style=\"background:#efefef\" |1 | colspan=\"16\" width=\"95.4%\" align=\"center\" |Israeli Premier League 14 clubs |- | colspan=\"2\" width=\"4.6%\" align=\"center\" style=\"background:#efefef\" |2 | colspan=\"16\" width=\"95.4%\" align=\"center\" |Liga Leumit 16 clubs |- | colspan=\"2\" width=\"4.6%\" align=\"center\" style=\"background:#efefef\" |3 | colspan=\"8\" width=\"47.7%\" align=\"center\" |Liga Alef North 16 clubs | colspan=\"8\" width=\"47.7%\" align=\"center\" |Liga Alef South 16 clubs |- | colspan=\"2\" width=\"4.6%\" align=\"center\" style=\"background:#efefef\" |4 | colspan=\"4\" width=\"23.85%\" align=\"center\" |Liga Bet North A 16 clubs | colspan=\"4\" width=\"23.85%\" align=\"center\" |Liga Bet North B 16 clubs | colspan=\"4\" width=\"23.85%\" align=\"center\" |Liga Bet South A 16 clubs | colspan=\"4\" width=\"23.85%\" align=\"center\" |Liga Bet South B 16 clubs |- | colspan=\"2\" width=\"4.6%\" align=\"center\" style=\"background:#efefef\" |5 | colspan=\"2\" width=\"11.925%\" align=\"center\" |Liga Gimel North Upper Galilee 14 clubs | colspan=\"2\" width=\"11.925%\" align=\"center\" |Liga Gimel North Lower Galilee 14 clubs | colspan=\"2\" width=\"11.925%\" align=\"center\" |Liga Gimel North Jezreel 13 clubs | colspan=\"2\" width=\"11.925%\" align=\"center\" |Liga Gimel North Samaria 13 clubs | colspan=\"2\" width=\"11.925%\" align=\"center\" |Liga Gimel South Sharon 13 clubs | colspan=\"2\" width=\"11.925%\" align=\"center\" |Liga Gimel South Tel Aviv 14 clubs | colspan=\"2\" width=\"11.925%\" align=\"center\" |Liga Gimel South Central 12 clubs | colspan=\"2\" width=\"11.925%\" align=\"center\" |Liga Gimel South South 15 clubs |} ===League structure history=== League football in Mandatory Palestine began in 1931, and second and third tiers were added to the league as early as 1937. However, football was then disrupted by the Arab revolt and then World War II. In 1947, league football resumed with two tiers, the top Palestine League and the second tier Liga Bet. Following the Israeli Declaration of Independence and War of Independence, football league action resumed in 1949, with a two-tier league, the second served as a temporary second division, titled Liga Meuhedet (lit. 'Special League'). The following season, league football was cancelled due to disagreements between the Maccabi and Hapoel factions in the IFA. With the return of league football the following season, a third tier was added, and the leagues were assigned as Liga Alef (lit. 'League A'), Liga Bet ('League B') and Liga Gimel ('League C'). In 1955\u201356, Liga Leumit (lit. 'National League') was created as the new top division, demoting the Alef, Bet and Gimel leagues to the second, third and fourth tiers respectively, with a fifth tier, Liga Dalet (lit. 'Liga D') added for one season in 1958\u201359, before returning in 1969\u201370. In 1976\u201377, Liga Artzit (lit. 'State League') was created as the new second tier, demoting the Alef, Bet, Gimel and Dalet leagues to the third, fourth, fifth and sixth tiers. Liga Dalet was scrapped at the end of the 1984\u201385 season, bringing back the league system to five tiers. In 1999\u20132000 the Israeli Premier League was added at the top of the league system, demoting the other leagues to second to sixth tiers. At the end of the 2008\u201309 season, Liga Artzit was scrapped, bringing the league system back to five tiers, and its current structure ====League system changes==== {| class=wikitable !Years !1st tier !2nd tier !3rd tier !4th tier !5th tier !6th tier |- |1946\u20131948 |Palestine League |Liga Bet |align=center|\u2013 |align=center|\u2013 |align=center|\u2013 |align=center|\u2013 |- |1949\u20131950 |Israeli League |Liga Meuhedet |align=center|\u2013 |align=center|\u2013 |align=center|\u2013 |align=center|\u2013 |- |1951\u20131955 |Liga Alef |Liga Bet |Liga Gimel |align=center|\u2013 |align=center|\u2013 |align=center|\u2013 |- |1955\u20131958 |rowspan=6|Liga Leumit |rowspan=4|Liga Alef |rowspan=4|Liga Bet |rowspan=4|Liga Gimel |align=center|\u2013 |align=center|\u2013 |- |1958\u20131959 |Liga Dalet |align=center|\u2013 |- |1959\u20131969 |align=center|\u2013 |align=center|\u2013 |- |1969\u20131976 |Liga Dalet |align=center|\u2013 |- |1976\u20131985 |rowspan=2|Liga Artzit |rowspan=2|Liga Alef |rowspan=2|Liga Bet |rowspan=2|Liga Gimel |Liga Dalet |- |1985\u20131999 |align=center|\u2013 |- |1999\u20132009 |rowspan=2|Premier League |rowspan=2|Liga Leumit |Liga Artzit |Liga Alef |Liga Bet |Liga Gimel |- |2009\u2013 current |Liga Alef |Liga Bet |Liga Gimel |align=center|\u2013 |- |} ==Leagues== ===Premier League=== The Israeli Premier League (, Ligat HaAl, lit.
