She is well known for her research on the applications of wavelet analysis in the fields of hydrology and geophysics and her many contributions to academic journals and national committees. == Background and education == Foufoula- Georgiou was born in Livadeia, Greece in 1957, and received a diploma in Civil Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens. She received her M.S. in Environmental Engineering in 1982 from the University of Florida, and a Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering from the University of Florida in 1985. == Career and research == She began her career in academia as an Assistant Professor at Iowa State University (from 1986-1989). She then moved to the University of Minnesota, where she was an Associate Professor before earning a position as a full Professor. She later became the director of the Saint Anthony Falls Laboratory. She is now a Professor Emerita at the University of Minnesota. She accepted a position at the University of California, Irvine in 2016, where she currently resides. She is a distinguished professor at the University and holds the Henry Samueli Endowed Chair in Engineering. She is also the Associate Dean for Research and Innovation. Foufoula-Georgiou is best known for her research within the field of Environmental Engineering, including her work with wavelet analysis and its applications in Geophysics. She is also a member of multiple national committees, including the NASA Earth Sciences Subcommittee and the US Nuclear Waste and Technical Review Board. == Awards == * In 2002, she received the John Dalton Medal of the European Geophysical Society. * In 2007, she was awarded the Hydrologic Sciences Award of the American Geophysical Union. * In 2016 she was chosen as the Robert E. Horton Lecturer in Hydrology by the American Meteorological Society * In 2018 Foufoula-Georgiou was elected to the National Academy of Engineering for \"For contributions to hydrology and hydroclimatology with applications to engineered systems across scales.\" * In 2019, Dr. Foufoula-Georgiou was awarded the American Geophysical Union Hydrology Section Walter B. Langbein Lecture for lifetime contributions to the science of hydrology and/or for unselfish cooperation in hydrologic research. https://connect.agu.org/hydrology/awards/langbein-lecture == Publications == * \u201cWavelet Analysis in Geophysics\u201d, 1994, Academic Press Inc. * \u201cToward a unified science of the Earth's surface: Opportunities for synthesis among hydrology, geomorphology, geochemistry, and ecology,\u201d 2006, American Geophysical Union * \u201cA Markov Renewal Model for Rainfall Occurrences\u201d, 1987, American Geophysical Union * \u201cGradient Dynamic Programming for Stochastic Optimal Control of Multidimensional Water Resources Systems\u201d, 1988, American Geophysical Union * \u201cA nonlocal theory of sediment transport on hillslopes\u201d, 2010, Journal of Geophysical Research * \u201cRecent advances in rainfall modeling, estimation, and forecasting\u201d, 1995, American Geophysical Union == References == Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:People from Livadeia Category:Geophysicists Category:University of California, Irvine faculty Category:Environmental engineers Category:National Technical University of Athens alumni Category:University of Florida alumni Category:21st-century women engineers Category:20th-century women engineers Category:Greek women engineers Category:Greek emigrants to the United States ",
