    "text": "The Sydney Cricket and Sports Ground Trust (popularly known as the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust or SCG Trust) is an agency of the Government of New South Wales that operates several sporting facilities in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The SCG Trust operates the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) and Sydney Football Stadium (SFS) at Moore Park in Sydney. In mid-2008, its head office The Sheridan Building opened, making it the third building to erect in the Gold Members Car Park, alongside the headquarters of Sydney City Roosters and New South Wales Rugby Union. Soon after it opened, Sydney Swans and Sydney FC relocated their headquarters inside the Sheridan Building. There are four clubs from four sports codes with their headquarters at the ground. In 2007 the UTS-Balmain club formed a partnership with the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust and are now known as Sydney CC or Sydney Cricket Club or just simply Sydney Tigers. ==Statues== The Trust has commissioned ten bronze sculpture statues to be placed around the grounds of the SCG and SFS. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
