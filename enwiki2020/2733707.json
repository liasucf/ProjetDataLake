    "text": "Boole's expansion theorem, often referred to as the Shannon expansion or decomposition, is the identity: F = x \\cdot F_x + x' \\cdot F_{x'}, where F is any Boolean function, x is a variable, x' is the complement of x, and F_xand F_{x'} are F with the argument x set equal to 1 and to 0 respectively. The terms F_x and F_{x'} are sometimes called the positive and negative Shannon cofactors, respectively, of F with respect to x. These are functions, computed by restrict operator, \\operatorname{restrict}(F, x, 0) and \\operatorname{restrict}(F, x, 1) (see valuation (logic) and partial application). It has been called the \"fundamental theorem of Boolean algebra\".Paul C. Rosenbloom, The Elements of Mathematical Logic, 1950, p. 5 Besides its theoretical importance, it paved the way for binary decision diagrams, satisfiability solvers, and many other techniques relevant to computer engineering and formal verification of digital circuits. ==Statement of the theorem== A more explicit way of stating the theorem is: : f(X_1, X_2, \\dots , X_n) = X_1 \\cdot f(1, X_2, \\dots , X_n) + X_1' \\cdot f(0, X_2, \\dots , X_n) == Variations and implications == ; XOR-Form : The statement also holds when the disjunction \"+\" is replaced by the XOR operator: : f(X_1, X_2, \\dots , X_n) = X_1 \\cdot f(1, X_2, \\dots , X_n) \\oplus X_1' \\cdot f(0, X_2, \\dots , X_n) ; Dual form: There is a dual form of the Shannon expansion (which does not have a related XOR form): : f(X_1, X_2, \\dots , X_n) = (X_1 + f(0, X_2, \\dots , X_n)) \\cdot (X_1' + f(1, X_2, \\dots , X_n)) Repeated application for each argument leads to the Sum of Products (SoP) canonical form of the Boolean function f. For example for n=2 that would be :\\begin{align}f(X_1, X_2) & = X_1 \\cdot f(1, X_2) + X_1' \\cdot f(0, X_2)\\\\\\ & = X_1 X_2 \\cdot f(1, 1) + X_1 X_2' \\cdot f(1, 0) + X_1' X_2 \\cdot f(0, 1) + X_1' X_2' \\cdot f(0, 0) \\end{align} Likewise, application of the dual form leads to the Product of Sums (PoS) canonical form (using the distributivity law of + over \\cdot): :\\begin{align}f(X_1, X_2) & = (X_1 + f(0, X_2)) \\cdot (X_1' + f(1, X_2))\\\\\\ & = (X_1 + X_2 + f(0, 0)) \\cdot (X_1 + X_2' + f(0, 1)) \\cdot (X_1' + X_2 + f(1, 0)) \\cdot (X_1' + X_2' + f(1, 1)) \\end{align} == Properties of cofactors == ; Linear properties of cofactors: : For a boolean function F which is made up of two boolean functions G and H the following are true: : If F = H' then F_x = H'_x : If F = G \\cdot H then F_x = G_x \\cdot H_x : If F = G + H then F_x = G_x + H_x : If F = G \\oplus H then F_x = G_x \\oplus H_x ; Characteristics of unate functions: : If F is a unate function and... : If F is positive unate then F = x \\cdot F_x + F_{x'} : If F is negative unate then F = F_x + x' \\cdot F_{x'} == Operations with cofactors == ; Boolean difference: : The boolean difference or boolean derivative of the function F with respect to the literal x is defined as: : \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = F_x \\oplus F_{x'} ; Universal quantification: : The universal quantification of F is defined as: : \\forall x F = F_x \\cdot F_{x'} ; Existential quantification: : The existential quantification of F is defined as: : \\exists x F = F_x + F_{x'} ==History== George Boole presented this expansion as his Proposition II, \"To expand or develop a function involving any number of logical symbols\", in his Laws of Thought (1854),George Boole, An Investigation of the Laws of Thought: On which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities, 1854, p. 72 full text at Google Books and it was \"widely applied by Boole and other nineteenth-century logicians\".Frank Markham Brown, Boolean Reasoning: The Logic of Boolean Equations, 2nd edition, 2003, p. 42 Claude Shannon mentioned this expansion, among other Boolean identities, in a 1948 paper,Claude Shannon, \"The Synthesis of Two-Terminal Switching Circuits\", Bell System Technical Journal 28:59\u201398, full text, p. 62 and showed the switching network interpretations of the identity. In the literature of computer design and switching theory, the identity is often incorrectly attributed to Shannon. ==Application to switching circuits== # Binary decision diagrams follow from systematic use of this theorem # Any Boolean function can be implemented directly in a switching circuit using a hierarchy of basic multiplexer by repeated application of this theorem. ==Notes== ==See also== * Reed\u2013Muller expansion ==External links== * Shannon\u2019s Decomposition Example with multiplexers. * Optimizing Sequential Cycles Through Shannon Decomposition and Retiming (PDF) Paper on application.
