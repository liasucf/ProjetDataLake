    "text": "Dance of Time is a 2017 studio album by Brazilian jazz musician Eliane Elias. The album was recorded in Brazil and released on March 24, 2017 via Concord Records. This is her 25th album as a leader. Dance of Time received the Latin Grammy for Best Latin Jazz Album at the 18th Annual Latin Grammy Awards. ==Background== Guest musicians include pianist Amilton Godoy, Brazilian guitarists Jo\u00e3o Bosco and Toquinho, trumpeter Randy Brecker, vibraphonist Mike Mainieri, and singer Mark Kibble. The album celebrates the samba, a genre originating in Bahia via Africa as the last year marked the 100th anniversary of \"Pelo Telefone\", the first recorded samba track. Eliane's style of samba greatly borrows from choro, a tango influenced, slower type of samba that emerged in the 1930s. The album contains skillfully arranged classic tracks and contemporary samba compositions. ==Reception== Peter Jones of London Jazz News noted, \"As smooth as a smoothie made of liquid silk, singer and pianist Eliane Elias has spent the last three decades flying the flag for the kind of Brazilian music that first became internationally popular in the late 1950s. But far from being a mere nostalgist, she keeps it alive and kicking with her bold, contemporary arrangements... On this new album she focuses on the samba, with a side order of bossa nova. But what makes it the best collection of hers that I've ever heard (and I must admit, I haven't heard all 23 albums) is the inclusion of some astoundingly good sidemen.\" John Fordham of The Guardian wrote, \"As a vocalist, the Brazilian Eliane Elias radiates as much starry smooth-jazzy hipness as Diana Krall, but as an improvising pianist she's in a different league: a wellspring of polished bebop lines and skittish flourishes... Elias's trumpeter ex-husband Randy Brecker and Steps Ahead vibraphone partner Mike Mainieri are in the lineup, and the songs embrace jazz standards, Brazilian classics and poignant originals such as the dreamy Little Paradise.\" Dance of Time received the Latin Grammy for Best Latin Jazz Album and was nominated for Best Engineered Album at the 18th Annual Latin Grammy Awards. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Band * Eliane Elias \u2013 piano, vocals, producer * Randy Brecker \u2013 flugelhorn * Amilton Godoy \u2013 piano * Mike Mainieri \u2013 vibraphone * Jo\u00e3o Bosco \u2013 guitar, vocals * Conrado Goys \u2013 electric guitar * Marcus Teixeira \u2013 acoustic guitar * Toquinho \u2013 guitar, vocals * Marcelo Mariano \u2013 bass guitar * Celso de Almeida \u2013 drums * Ed\u00fa Ribeiro \u2013 drums * Gustavo Di Dalva \u2013 percussion * Marivaldo Dos Santos \u2013 percussion * Mark Kibble \u2013 background vocals Production *Paul Blakemore \u2013 mastering *Rodrigo de Castro Lopes \u2013 engineer *Chris Dunn \u2013 A&R; *Mary Hogan \u2013 A&R; *Marc Johnson \u2013 producer *Pete Karam \u2013 mixing *Bryan Pugh \u2013 vocal engineer *Steve Rodby \u2013 producer *Philppe Salomon \u2013 photography *Carrie Smith \u2013 package design *Bob Wolfenson \u2013 photography ==References== ==External links== * Official site Category:2017 albums Category:Eliane Elias albums Category:Latin Grammy Award for Best Latin Jazz Album ",
