    "text": "Valiyakunnu is a municipal town located in Malappuram district, Kerala, India. Devi Temple, Kadampuzha Valanchery Town ==Demographics== At the 2011 India census,'India Census details' Valanchery/ Kattipparuthi had a population of 35,795. Males constituted 48.86% (17,490) and females 51.13% (18,305). The number of households in Valanchery was listed as 5,926. ==History== This place was originally part of the Valluvanad Swaroopam dynasty.''' Valluvanad was an erstwhile late medieval feudal state in present state of Kerala in South India extending from the Bharathapuzha River in the south to the Pandalur Mala in the north during their zenith in the early Middle Ages. On the west, it was bounded by the Arabian Sea at the port Ponnani and on the east by Attappadi Hills. According to local legends, the last Later Chera ruler gave a vast extension of land in South Malabar to one of their governors, Valluvakkonithiri and left for a hajj. The Valluvakkonithiri was also given last Later Chera ruler's shield (presumably to defend himself from the sword received by the Samoothiri (Zamorin) of Kozhikode, another governor, from the departing ruler). Not surprisingly, the Vellatiri rajas were hereditary enemies of the Samoothiri. Valluvanad is famous for the Mamankam festivals, held once in 12 years and the endless wars against the Samoothiri of Kozhikode. By the late 18th century, Vellatiri or Walluwanad proper was the sole remaining territory of the Walluvanad raja (Valluva Konatiri), who once exercised suzerain rights over a large portion of Southern Malabar. Although management of the country was restored to the Vellatiri raja in 1792, it soon became evident that he was powerless to repress the trouble that quickly broke out between Mapillas (favored by the Mysorean occupiers) and nayars (who sought to restore the ancien r\u00e9gime), and already in 1793 management of the district had to be resumed as the chief and his family fled to Travancore. ==Notable persons== * K T Jaleel, politician and social worker * Unni Menon, playback singer * Shweta Menon, actress ==Culture== Valanchery village is a predominantly Muslim populated area. Hindus exist in comparatively smaller numbers. So the culture of the locality is based upon Muslim traditions. Duff Muttu, Kolkali and Aravanamuttu are common folk arts of this locality. There are many libraries attached to mosques giving a rich source of Islamic studies. Most of the books are written in Arabi-Malayalam which is a version of the Malayalam language written in Arabic script. People gather in mosques for the evening prayer and continue to sit there after the prayers discussing social and cultural issues. Business and family issues are also sorted out during these evening meetings. The Hindu minority of this area keeps their rich traditions by celebrating various festivals in their temples. Hindu rituals are done here with a regular devotion like other parts of Kerala. ==Transportation== Valanchery village connects to other parts of India through National highway No.66 passes through Kuttippuram, Edappal, Ponnani and the northern stretch connects to Goa and Mumbai. The southern stretch connects to Cochin and Trivandrum. The nearest airport is at Kozhikode. The nearest major railway stations are at Kuttippuram, Tirur. ==Establishments and Institutions== ===Government institutions=== *PHC Valanchery *PHC Vadakkumpuram *PHC Mattummal, Athavanad *PHC Kodumudi *Govt.
