The referendum was to decide whether enough had returned for the area to be considered Kurdish.Iraq: Kurds warn against delaying Kirkuk Referendum RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty Kurdish resentment over the government's failure to implement Article 140 was one of the reasons for the 2017 Kurdistan Region independence referendum, which posed the question, \"Do you want the Kurdistan Region and the Kurdistani areas outside the Region to become an independent state?\" The referendum led to episodes of Iraqi\u2013Kurdish conflict and the government takeover of Kirkuk. ==The Iraqi Constitution== thumb|Disputed areas in Iraq according to Article 140: Following the invasion of Iraq in 2003 by the United States-led coalition, the country was under the direct rule of the United States- appointed Coalition Provisional Authority, with advice from selected Iraqi leaders who sat on the Iraqi Governing Council. The IGC approved an interim constitution, the Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period (Transitional Administrative Law, TAL), which established the framework for the drafting and approval of a permanent constitution. The TAL included specific clauses providing for the return of and compensation for forced migrants and for the \"resolution of disputed territories including Kirkuk\" through arbitration: In 2005, a permanent Constitution was approved which referred back to the TAL and set a deadline of the end of 2007 for completion: In late 2007, the U.N. Special Representative for Iraq negotiated an extension of the deadline for six months. However, the federal parliament decided to refer the matter to the Constitutional Court to rule whether the article was now expired or how it should be implemented.Kirkuk's Article 140: Expired or Not?, Nazar Janabi, Washington Institute for Near East Policy, 31 January 2008 ==De-Arabization== The government of Nouri al-Maliki appointed a \"Commission on the Normalisation of the Status of Kirkuk\" to implement the de- Arabization program.
