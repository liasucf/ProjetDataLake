He was the son of Samuel and Rose Corwin and was born in Boston, Massachusetts. Corwin was a major figure during the Golden Age of Radio.

His earliest goal was to be a writer.R. Leroy Bannerman. Norman Corwin and Radio. University of Alabama Press, 2002, pp. 14-17. Because of his interest in writing, he sought a position in journalism, and was ultimately hired by the Greenfield (MA) Recorder as a cub reporter when he was only seventeen.William Grimes. \"Norman Corwin, Pioneer of Radio, Dies at 101.\" New York Times, October 19, 2011, p. B18. In Greenfield, he reported on the courts, and was also a film critic.\"For Radio Listeners.\" Washington (DC) Evening Star, June 10, 1945, p. C9. Several years later, Corwin was hired by the Springfield (MA) Republican. ==Radio career== While living and working in Springfield in the early 1930s, he became involved with radio broadcasting. He first worked as the radio editor of the Springfield Republican,\"Will Take Position with Station WLW.\" Springfield (MA) Republican, June 10, 1935, p. 4. and subsequently began broadcasting his own radio program. The date of his first broadcast has been reported as early as 1931 by R. Leroy Bannerman;R. Leroy Bannerman. Norman Corwin and Radio. University of Alabama Press, 2002, p. 17. but the Springfield (MA) Republican reported that his first program, Rhymes and Cadences, a show during which Corwin read poetry, and his friend Benjamin Kalman offered musical interludes on the piano, debuted in March 1934 on WBZ in Boston and WBZA in Springfield.\"Rhymes and Cadences Opens This Afternoon.\" Springfield (MA) Republican, March 27, 1934, p. 11.

He remained with CBS until 1949.William Grimes. \"Norman Corwin, Pioneer of Radio, Dies at 101.\" New York Times, October 19, 2011, p. B18. The first program he produced and hosted for CBS was \"Words Without Music,\" the goal of which, Corwin said, was to make poetry more entertaining. It went on the air over CBS affiliate WABC in New York in early December 1938.\"Radio Programs and Highlights of Nearby Stations.\" Lexington (KY) Herald, December 4, 1938, p. 2. Corwin continued to produce and host a wide range of programs for CBS.

Corwin said it was written at the \"invitation\" of the U.S. Office of Facts and Figures. He recalled being on a train on his way to California to produce the program when news of the attack on Pearl Harbor came to him. He sent a telegram to Washington at the next stop, asking if the OFF still wanted the program done. When he got to Albuquerque, a telegram was waiting for him: \"the President says, 'now more than ever.'\"Corwin's notes in More by Corwin Many radio and movie stars of the day featured, along with an epilogue by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. With an audience of 60 million listeners it became one of the most famous ever produced on radio.\"Norman Corwin's Radio Classic, 60 Years Later\" National Public Radio sponsored a new version of this program in 1991, for the bicentennial of the United States Bill of Rights.

Murrow combined to produce An American in England on CBS radio.

He made weekly reports from England via shortwave August 3 \u2013 September 7, then did four more episodes December 1\u201322 after he had returned to New York City. Corwin's most famous work is On a Note of Triumph, a celebration of the Allied victory in Europe, first broadcast on VE Day, May 8, 1945. Not knowing where he would be when the end came, broadcast historian Erik Barnouw wrote, Corwin had performers ready in both New York City and Los Angeles. The program went on (from the Los Angeles studios of CBS Radio Station KNX), with Martin Gabel as host/narrator and with William L. Shirer (via cable from New York) re- creating his role as reporter in the Compeigne forest covering the French surrender to Germany. Corwin wrote a similar program for CBS, Fourteen August, which was broadcast on V-J Day. This critically acclaimed broadcast earned him a Distinguished Achievement Award from Radio Life magazine.\"Sideshow of Radio Attractions.\" Richmond (VA) Times-Dispatch, June 30, 1946, p. D9. Corwin was also the first winner of the One World Award established by the Common Council for American Unity along with the (Wendell) Willkie Memorial of Freedom House.

Programs featured Great Britain, Western Europe, Sweden and Poland, Russia, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Egypt and India, Shanghai and Cities of the Far East, The Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand.Keith, M.C.

B18. other sources say he left radio after persistent accusations that he was a Communist sympathizer, a charge which he always vehemently denied.\"Informants' FBI Reports Read In Court.\" Canton (OH) Repository, June 9, 1949, pp. 1, 8.
