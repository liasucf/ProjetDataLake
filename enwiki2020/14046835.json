    "text": "The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question? is a 1993 popular science book by Nobel Prize-winning physicist Leon M. Lederman and science writer Dick Teresi. The book provides a brief history of particle physics, starting with the Pre-Socratic Greek philosopher Democritus, and continuing through Isaac Newton, Roger J. Boscovich, Michael Faraday, and Ernest Rutherford and quantum physics in the 20th century. Lederman explains in the book why he gave the Higgs boson the nickname \"The Goddamn Particle\": In 2013, subsequent to the discovery of the Higgs boson, Lederman co-authored, with theoretical physicist Christopher T. Hill, a sequel: Beyond the God Particle which delves into the future of particle physics in the post-Higgs boson era. The book is part of a trilogy, with companions, Symmetry and the Beautiful Universe and Quantum Physics for Poets (see bibliography below). == Historical context == Fermilab director and subsequent Nobel physics prize winner Leon M. Lederman was a very prominent early supporter \u2013 some sources say the architect or proposer \u2013 of the Superconducting Super Collider project, which was endorsed around 1983, and was a major proponent and advocate throughout its lifetime. Direct link to article. Lederman wrote his 1993 popular science book \u2013 which sought to promote awareness of the significance of such a project \u2013 in the context of the project's last years and the changing political climate of the 1990s. The increasingly moribund project was finally shelved that same year after some $2 billion of expenditure. The proximate causes of the closure were the rising US budget deficit, rising projected costs of the project, and the cessation of the Cold War which reduced the perceived political pressure within the United States to undertake and complete high-profile megaprojects of this kind. == List of chapters == A simulated event at the Large Hadron Collider. This simulation depicts the decay of a Higgs particle following a collision of two protons in the CMS experiment *Chapter 1: The Invisible Soccer Ball: This chapter uses a metaphor of a soccer game with an invisible ball to depict the process by which the existence of particles are deduced.L&T; pp. 9\u201312. Also, in this chapter Dr. Lederman gives a brief background story of what led him to particle physics.L&T; pp. 5\u20138, 21. *Chapter 2: The First Particle Physicist: In a fictional dream, Dr. Lederman meets Democritus, an ancient Greek philosopher who lived during the Classical Greek Civilization, and has a conversation (a Socratic dialogue) with him.L&T; pp. 32\u201358. *Chapter 3: Looking For The Atom: The Mechanics: This chapter covers Galileo, Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton.L&T; pp. 65\u2013103. *Chapter 4: Still Looking for the Atom: Chemists and Electricians: This chapter covers physicists from the 18th century onward including J.J. Thomson, John Dalton, and Dmitri Mendeleev (1834\u20131907).L&T; pp. 104\u2013140. *Chapter 5: The Naked Atom: This chapter paints a picture of the shift from classical physics to the birth and development of quantum mechanics.L&T; pp. 141\u2013188. *Chapter 6: Accelerators: They Smash Atoms, Don\u2019t They?: Covers the development of particle accelerators.L&T; pp. 199\u2013255. *Chapter 7: A-tom!: The book uses the word \"A-tom\" to refer to Democritus' fundamental, uncuttable particle. This chapter covers the discovery of the fundamental particles of the Standard Model.L&T; pp. 274\u2013341. *Chapter 8: The God Particle At Last: Covers spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs boson.L&T; pp. 342\u2013346. *Chapter 9: Inner Space, Outer Space, and the Time Before Time: Looks at astrophysics and describes the evidence for the Big Bang.L&T; pp. 382\u2013409. ==See also== * C.
