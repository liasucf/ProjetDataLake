As a result of his Catholic faith, Blessed John Talbot suffered severe persecution, including multiple arrests, fines and confiscation of his property. He had to endure these punishments on a daily basis -a severe test of his faith and loyalty.Book of Saints, by the Monks of Ramsgate. John Talbot was present at prayer with the priest, Blessed Thomas Palasor, Blessed John Norton and several companions at a house in Lamesley, Gateshead when he was arrested in 1600. It was Blessed John Talbot who tried to prevent the arrest of the priest. For this, he too was arrested as a traitor. John Talbot was imprisoned and confined in a dungeon and shortly thereafter, sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered for the crime of harbouring a Catholic priest. On Wednesday 9 August 1600, Blessed John Talbot was brought to the gallows site in Durham, on the crest of the hill at the north side of Durham City. He was given the chance to save his life if he would renounce the Catholic faith and attend Protestant services -he refused. Talbot was tortured on the rack, hanged until not quite dead, then disembowelled, before being beheaded.A Menology of England and Wales: Or, Brief Memorials of the Ancient British ...
