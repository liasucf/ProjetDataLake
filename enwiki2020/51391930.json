    "text": "Paul William Dunbar High School, originally Bessemer Colored High School, was a public school for African-American students which operated in Bessemer, Alabama from 1923 to 1980. It served grades 1 through 12 when it opened, and its first graduating class matriculated in 1927 under principal J. B. Bickerstaff. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. At the suggestion of English teacher Pearl Blivens, the school was renamed for Ohio-born poet Paul Laurence Dunbar (1872-1906) in 1928. In addition to academic subjects, the school offered a wide range of vocational training programs. Among the school's notable faculty members was Arthur Shores, a polymath who taught science, history, civics and literature. He served briefly as principal before becoming a notable civil rights attorney. Notable graduates include art collector Paul R. Jones and activist James Boggs. Long-time principal Jackson Solomon Abrams died in 1959 and a new high school then under construction was named in his memory. Dunbar was converted into an elementary and middle school until it closed in 1980. The building was subsequently acquired by the National Dunbar-Abrams Foundation and partially renovated as a community center. The former school was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. ==Athletics== Dunbar High School fielded a football team nicknamed the Blue Devils.
