    "text": "Les nuits d'\u00e9t\u00e9 (Summer Nights), Op. 7, is a song cycle by the French composer Hector Berlioz, setting six poems by Th\u00e9ophile Gautier. The cycle, completed in 1841, was originally for soloist and piano accompaniment. Berlioz orchestrated one of the songs in 1843, and did the same for the other five in 1856. The cycle was neglected for many years, but during the 20th century it became, and has remained, one of the composer's most popular works. Of the many recordings made in the 20th and 21st centuries, most are of the orchestrated version and are sung by a soprano or mezzo-soprano. ==Single female voice== Recordings include: * Victoria de los \u00c1ngeles, soprano.
