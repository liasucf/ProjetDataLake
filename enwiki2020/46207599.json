The train had run from 1982 to 1985 between cities of Concordia (Argentina) and Salto (Uruguay). After 26 years of being active only for freight trains, the service was officially re-opened on August 11, 2011, in a ceremony held by Presidents of both countries.Tren Binacional - institucional (Archive), 4 Feb 2012 On 23 September the train made its first journey carrying people from Pilar to Paso de los Toros. Some intermediate stops were Argentine stations Z\u00e1rate, Enrique Carb\u00f3, Urdinarrain, Basavilbaso, Villaguay, San Salvador and Concordia and Uruguayan Salto, Quebracho and Paysand\u00fa. From Pilar to Buenos Aires passengers were carried by bus.

On its first official journey, the train only reached Salto due to the Uruguayan Ministry of Transport still not having given authorisation for the service to operate in the country. Therefore, all passengers had to get out in Salto and the train continued without people to Paso de los Toros. The service was finally restarted on 30 September. Nevertheless, the service ran to Paso de los Toros only five times, with the terminus set up in Paysand\u00fa from November 2011.\"Llegamos hasta la tumba del tren de los pueblos libres\", La Prensa, 7 Mar 2014 From March 2012, the service was shortened again, setting Salto as terminus of the line.
