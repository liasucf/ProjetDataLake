At the beginning of 2001 a new Caf\u00e9 Josty was opened at the Sony Center, not far from its original location. == History == === Nineteenth Century === Paul Hoeniger: Im Caf\u00e9 Josty, 1890 The Josty brothers immigrated from Sils in Switzerland to Berlin and founded the pastry bakery Zuckerb\u00e4ckerei Johann Josty & Co. in 1796. From this company emerged the Caf\u00e9 Josty, starting at least from 1812. First located on \"An der Stechbahn\", then on the Schlossfreiheit (now the Schlossplatz square), and finally after 1880, on the Potsdamer Platz. The earlier addresses were frequented by artists like Heinrich Heine, Joseph von Eichendorff and the Grimm Brothers\u2014and during the imperial times Theodor Fontane and Adolph von Menzel. In 1900, the Josty family sold the cafe to the widow of the founder of the Caf\u00e9 Bauer. The Josty was modernized but retained its original name. === Twentieth Century === In the twentieth century, the cafe became an important meeting place for artists, especially of the Expressionism and New Objectivity movements. Paul Boldt described the appearance of the cafe in a well-known 1912 sonnet. Erich K\u00e4stner used the cafe as the setting for an important scene in the children's book Emil und die Detektive. The cafe closed in 1930, and the building was destroyed during World War II. In Wim Wenders' film Wings of Desire, Homer, an old poet and storyteller played by Curt Bois, attempts to find the location of the cafe but fails. == New Caf\u00e9 Josty == The new Caf\u00e9 Josty is located in the Sony-Center, only 200 meters away from its original location. It is popular with tourists and attracts some artists during the Berlinale. == See also == * Hotel Esplanade (Berlin) == External links == * Caf\u00e9 Josty, 1901, Painting by Paul H\u00f6niger * View of the Caf\u00e9 Josty (circa 1920) Category:Buildings and structures in Mitte Category:Culture in Berlin Category:Caf\u00e9s in Berlin ",
