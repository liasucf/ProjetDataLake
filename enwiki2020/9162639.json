    "text": "The cinereus ringtail possum (Pseudochirulus cinereus), also known as the Daintree River ringtail possum, is a species of possum found in northeastern Queensland, Australia. It was long believed to be the same as the Herbert River ringtail possum (P. herbertensis), but has recently been separated. The two species differ considerably in appearance. The cinereus ringtail possum is a cinnamon or brown colour, and has been said, like the lemur-like ringtail possum (Hemibelideus lemuroides), to resemble a lemur. It is found in montane tropical rainforest in three separate populations just north of Cairns: on Carbine Tableland, Mount Windsor Tableland and Thornton Peak massif. ==References== Category:Possums Category:Mammals of Queensland Category:Mammals described in 1945 ",
