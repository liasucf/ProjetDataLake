He was born in Philadelphia in February 1840. He enlisted at Philadelphia on February 1, 1858 just prior to his 18th birthday, with his father approving the enlistment and signing with an \"x.\" He was sent West, where he protected the Pony Express before being sent East to fight in the Rebellion. He was assigned to Battery \"B\" of the Fourth U. S. Artillery. During the Rebellion, he was wounded at the Battle of Sharpsburg, wounded at the Battle of Spottsylvania, and shot in the abdomen, leg, mouth and stomach. He married Margaret Graham on July 16, 1867 in Junction City, Kansas. They had one child, Annie M., born in 1872. He divorced Margaret Graham and then married Alice Grugan in Prescott, Arizona on February 13, 1887. So conspicuous was his record as a soldier during that war that he was accorded the distinction by the United States Congress of being permitted to enter either the Senate Chambers or the floor of the House and enjoy any privilege of either. He and his wife were permitted to live on post after he retired in 1888, an honor accorded few service members. Tea died in the arms of his wife on September 14, 1911, in Prescott, Arizona at Fort Whipple and was originally buried in the Fort Whipple Cemetery. Later he was disinterred and re-buried in Mountain View Cemetery. His grave can be found in Section P, Lot 13, Grave D, next to the grave of his wife Alice Tea. ==Medal of Honor citation== Rank and organization: Sergeant, Company H, 6th U.S. Cavalry.
