He was a Prussian officer, Professor of History and a publicist. His book about the history of the Seven Years' War (1756\u201363) was the basis for many reprints, as well as for school books. Archenholz commissioned a Berlin artist, , to produce a copper etching for Archenholz's History of Gustav Vasa of the famous Swedish Nobility. He died in \u00d6jendorf (part of Hamburg today) on 28 February 1812, where a street is named after him today. ==Relevance and Life== Archenholz' understanding of his role as a publicist was very modern for his times. He strove not to deliver opinions to his readers but instead unbiased facts. His main interest was current politics in Europe as well as their historical development. In 1791 Archenholz lived in France with his family, publishing German language reports about the French Revolution in his journal Minerva. While at first he agreed with the ideas of the revolution, his view was changed by the ongoing violence. In 1792 he had to flee the country as he was threatened to be beheaded following some of his political papers. ==Publications== Tableau de l'Italie (French edition of Italien), 1788 * Annalen der britischen Geschichte: d.
