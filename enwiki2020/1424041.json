It was held to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. The election was called on September 13, 1933, and held on November 2, 1933.*Electoral History of BC 1871-1986, Elections BC The new legislature met for the first time on February 20, 1934. The Liberal Party won a majority government. The Official Opposition was formed by the social democratic Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, which was contesting its first election. Because of internal discord, the provincial executive of the Conservative Party decided not to contest the election officially each local association was to act on its own. Some candidates ran as Independents, some as Independent Conservatives. Those supporting the premier, Simon Fraser Tolmie, ran as Unionist Party of British Columbia, and those grouped around William John Bowser, a former premier, ran as the Non-Partisan Independent Group. When Bowser died and the elections in Vancouver Centre and Victoria City were postponed, 4 Non-partisan and 2 Unionist candidates withdrew. Other notable races include the election of Bridge River-Lillooet News publisher George Matheson Murray in Lillooet over Conservative Ernest Crawford Carson. Carson's brother Robert Henry Carson ran as a Liberal, winning Kamloops. Carson and his brother both served as cabinet ministers in later regimes. They were the sons of Robert Carson, an American who was one of the very few survivors of an Indian attack on a wagon train on the Oregon Trail and who went on to found one of the early ranches at Pavilion and whose holdings became part of the Diamond S Ranch.BCGNIS listing \"Mount Carson\" ==Results== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\" |- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\" !rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party !rowspan=\"2\"|Party leader !rowspan=\"2\"|# of candidates !colspan=\"3\"|Seats !colspan=\"3\"|Popular vote |- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\" |align=\"center\"|1928 |align=\"center\"|Elected |align=\"center\"|% Change |align=\"center\"|# |align=\"center\"|% |align=\"center\"|% Change |Liberal |align=\"center\"|Thomas Dufferin Pattullo |align=\"right\"|47 |align=\"right\"|12 |align=\"right\"|34 |align=\"right\"|+183.3% |align=\"right\"|159,131 |align=\"right\"| 41.74% |align=\"right\"| +1.70% |Co-operative Commonwealth Fed. |align=\"center\"| |align=\"right\"|46 |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|7 |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|120,185 |align=\"right\"| 31.53% |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"center\"|William John Bowser |align=\"right\"|30 |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|2 |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|38,836 |align=\"right\"| 10.19% |align=\"right\"| * | colspan=\"2\"|Independent1 |align=\"right\"|29 |align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"|2 |align=\"right\"| - |align=\"right\"|29,506 |align=\"right\"| 7.74% |align=\"right\"| +6.73% |Unionist2 |align=\"center\"|Simon Fraser Tolmie |align=\"right\"|12 |align=\"right\"| 35 |align=\"right\"|1 |align=\"right\"| -97.1% |align=\"right\"|15,445 |align=\"right\"| 4.05% |align=\"right\"| -49.25% |Labour/Independent Labour |align=\"center\"| |align=\"right\"|4 |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|1 |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|2,357 |align=\"right\"|0.62% |align=\"right\"| * | colspan=\"2\"|Independent Conservative |align=\"right\"|6 |align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"| - |align=\"right\"|7,114 |align=\"right\"| 1.87% |align=\"right\"|+1.58% |United Front (Workers and Farmers) Party3 |align=\"center\"| |align=\"right\"|20 |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|4,584 |align=\"right\"| 1.20% |align=\"right\"| * | colspan=\"2\"|Independent Co-operative Commonwealth |align=\"right\"|8 |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|2,266 |align=\"right\"|0.59% |align=\"right\"| * | colspan=\"2\"|Independent Liberal |align=\"right\"|2 |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|1,076 |align=\"right\"| 0.28% |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"center\"| |align=\"right\"|5 |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|370 |align=\"right\"|0.10% |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"center\"| |align=\"right\"|1 |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"| * |align=\"right\"|353 |align=\"right\"|0.09% |align=\"right\"| * |- |colspan=\"3\"|Total !align=\"right\"|210 !align=\"right\"|48 !align=\"right\"|47 !align=\"right\"| -2.1% !align=\"right\"|381,223 !align=\"right\"|100% |align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\" colspan=\"10\"|Source: Elections BC |- |} Notes: * Party did not nominate candidates in the previous election. 1 Includes Conservatives who ran as Independents. 2 Results compared to those of Conservative Party in previous election. 3 One United Front candidate, C.J.
