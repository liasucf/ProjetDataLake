It was a landmark on caravan routes through the T\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 region of the Sahara Desert in northeast Niger, so well known that it and the Arbre Perdu (Lost Tree) to the north are the only trees to be shown on a map at a scale of 1:4,000,000. The Tree of T\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 was located near a deep well. It was knocked down in 1973 by a truck driver. ==Background== The Tree of T\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 was the last of a group of trees that grew when the desert was less parched than it is today. The tree had stood alone for decades. During the winter of 1938-1939 a well was dug near the tree and it was found that the roots of the tree reached the water table 33-36 meters (108 to 118 feet) below the surface. Commander of the Allied Military Mission, Michel Lesourd, of the [Central service of Saharan affairs], saw the tree on May 21, 1939: In his book , French ethnologist and explorer Henri Lhote described his two journeys to the Tree of T\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9. His first visit was in 1934 on the occasion of the first automobile crossing between Djanet and Agadez. He describes the tree as \"an Acacia with a degenerative trunk, sick or ill in aspect. Nevertheless, the tree has nice green leaves, and some yellow flowers\". He visited it again 25 years later, on 26 November 1959 with the Berliet-T\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 mission, but found that it had been badly damaged after a vehicle had collided with it: ==Death and monument== Metal sculpture of the tree (1985) The pavilion housing the tree's remains in Niamey The Tree of T\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 was knocked down by a drunk Libyan truck driver in 1973.L'arbre du T\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9, symbole de la survie dans le Sahara(in French) On November 8, 1973, the dead tree was moved to the Niger National Museum in the capital Niamey. A simple metal sculpture representing the tree stands where the tree once was. ==In popular culture== The sculpture representing the Tree of T\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 and the Tree's story feature prominently in the 2006 film La Gran final (The Great Match). In the film, a group of Tuareg nomads in the Sahara race to find a power supply and broadcast reception for their television in time to watch the 2002 FIFA World Cup Final between Germany and Brazil, eventually using the tree sculpture as a makeshift antenna. In 2017, Symmetry Labs created a massive, 4-story tall LED sculpture entitled \"Tree of Tenere\" that was showcased at Burning Man.https://symmetrylabs.com/portfolio/tenere/ The sculpture consisted of 25,000 molded leaves containing 175,000 LED's. In 2018, the tree's story has appeared as a main theme in the official music video of 'Transmission/Michaelion'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g70u2OrfVBE music video by Ibeyi by Ibeyi. ==See also== * Dry tree * List of famous trees ==References== ==External links== * Photo Album of the Tenere Tree Category:Individual trees in Niger Category:Geography of Niger Category:Tuareg Category:Acacia Category:1970s individual tree deaths ",
