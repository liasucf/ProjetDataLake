It was Dean's first collaborative album and West's second. The album spawned one single entitled \"Slowly\", which would be released in 1971. Country Boy & Country Girl would also reach peak positions on national music publication charts following its release. ==Background and content== Jimmy Dean had wanted to record an album of duets with Dottie West several years prior to the release of Country Boy & Girl. However, scheduling conflicts required them to postpone the project until they could make arrangements. The album was produced by Jerry Bradley at RCA Studio B in September 1970. The record consisted of ten tracks, all of which were duet recordings. All of the album's tracks were previously recorded by other artists. Most of the songs were covers of duet recordings made hits by country music duo's. Among these tracks was \"Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You\", which was originally a hit for Jack Greene and Jeannie Seely. A second featured track is \"Jackson\", which was first a hit for Johnny Cash and June Carter. A third example is \"Let It Be Me\", which had recently been a duet hit for Glen Campbell and Bobby Gentry. ==Release and reception== Country Boy & Country Girl was released in November 1970 on RCA Victor Records. The album was issued as a vinyl LP, containing five songs on each side of the record. The album peaked at number 42 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart following its release. The album only spawned one single, \"Slowly\". Released in January 1971, the single became a top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart, reaching number 29 that year. Following its release, Country Boy & Country Girl was reviewed by Billboard in their November 1970 issue. Writers praised duet partnership, calling it powerful. They also highlighted several tracks that they believed were standout songs, including the single. \"This is very powerful country merchandise, coupling two artists of name power in a series of great country duets,\" reviewers commented. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== All credits are adapted from the liner notes of Country Boy & Country Girl.
