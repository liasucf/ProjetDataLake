Eventually Lisbon hears of Jo\u00e3o's (and Xica's) excesses and sends an inspector. Jos\u00e9, a political radical, is another main character, who provides Xica refuge. ==Cast== * Zez\u00e9 Motta as Xica da Silva * Walmor Chagas as Jo\u00e3o Fernandes * Altair Lima as Intendent * Elke Maravilha as Hort\u00eancia * Stepan Nercessian as Jos\u00e9 * Rodolfo Arena as Sargeant * Jos\u00e9 Wilker as The Count of Valadares * Marcos Vinicius as Teodoro * Jo\u00e3o Felicio dos Santos as pastor == TV adaptation == In 1996, the now defunct TV station Rede Manchete successfully adapted the film plot to the telenovela format, directed by Walter Avancini, written by Walcyr Carrasco and starring Ta\u00eds Ara\u00fajo as the title character.
