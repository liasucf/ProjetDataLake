Her mother is Latonja Richardson. Richardson is an aspiring astronaut, and admires Mae Jemison. She cites Jemison's book Find Where the Wind Goes, which she read in the third grade, as the source of her interest in space exploration.

Richardson is determined to visit Mars. === Philanthropy === In 2015 she organised \"Take A Flight with a Book\", delivering books to elementary schools in Jacksonville, Florida. She won the Hands On Jax Youth in Action Award for community service. Richardson was invited to attend a screening of Hidden Figures at the White House, where she met NASA astronaut Yvonne Cagle. Here, \"Michelle Obama stated that we have to do the work and that we have to take a seat at the STEM table and bring others with us\". In 2016, Richardson raised $18,000 to send girls in her hometown of Jacksonville, Florida, to see Hidden Figures. With the remaining proceeds, Richardson created a scholarship for Kaitlyn Ludlam to attend Space Camp. In 2018 she raised over $50,000 to send 1,000 students to see the film A Wrinkle in Time. She told Good Morning America she came up with the campaigns because \"representation matters\". Oprah Winfrey agreed to match her funding, bringing the total to $100,000. === Honors and recognition === Later that year, Richardson met astronaut Mae Jemison at the Clark Atlanta University graduation.
