Kenny, a librarian in his twenties, reflects on old age and how the elderly all look the same to him. He tells of the night he takes his grandmother to dinner, hurriedly collecting Robyn from her nursing home and rushing her by taxi to an upmarket restaurant. Once seated, Robyn makes Kenny uncomfortable by interrogating him and lecturing him on his love life. She eventually reveals she is not his grandmother at all, but his grandmother's next door neighbour, and has been playing him all night. Shocked, Kenny rushes back to the nursing home for his real grandmother and can only offer her dinner at a fast food chain. ==Background== The style of the film is inspired by the work of Woody Allen, from the opening titles to the direct address to camera, the bespectacled protagonist to the offbeat humour.
