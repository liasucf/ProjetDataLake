The neighborhood is the location of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport and the NASA Glenn Research Center. ==History== Hopkins became part of Cleveland after the annexation of the former municipality of West Park in 1923. The first major milestone for the neighborhood was the completion of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport in 1925, during the tenure of city manager William R. Hopkins. In 1942, Glenn Research Center (then named Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory) opened. ==References== ==External links== * Glenn Research Center | NASA * Cleveland Hopkins International Airport Category:Neighborhoods in Cleveland ",
