    "text": "\"Love Is a Stranger\" is a song by the British pop duo Eurythmics. Originally released in late 1982, the single was commercially unsuccessful, but it was re-released in 1983, reaching the UK top 10. The single was re-released again in 1991, to promote Eurythmics' Greatest Hits album. ==Commercial performance== Originally released in November 1982 in the United KingdomLove Is a Stranger\" reached number 54 on the UK Singles Chart. Following the huge success of \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" the following year, the song was re-released and reached number six in April 1983. In the United States, the song was the second single from the Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) album. The single was released just as the album title track reached number one, entering the Billboard Hot 100 at number 81 in September 1983 and peaking at number 23 in November of that year. The song spent 13 weeks on the chart. ==Music video== The single release was accompanied by a music video directed by Mike Brady, in which Stewart acts as chauffeur for Lennox, who plays the role of a high-class prostitute. Lennox removes a curly blonde wig to reveal close- cropped, red hair, though in the music video her hair was slicked back rather than being a buzz cut as seen in the subsequent music video, \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\". This caused minor controversy in the USA, as some people mistakenly thought Lennox was a male transvestite. ==Track listings== *7-inch single :A. \"Love Is a Stranger\" (LP version) \u2013 3:43 :B. \"Monkey Monkey\" (Non- LP track) \u2013 5:20 *12-inch single :A1. \"Love Is a Stranger\" (LP version) \u2013 3:43 :B1. \"Monkey Monkey\" (Non-LP track) \u2013 5:20 :B2. \"Let's Just Close Our Eyes\" (Non-LP track) \u2013 4:19 \"Let's Just Close Our Eyes\" is a newly recorded version of \"The Walk\" with a more synth-oriented instrumentation. *7-inch single (1991 reissue) :A. \"Love Is A Stranger\" (LP version) \u2013 3:43 :B. \"Julia\" (Edit) \u2013 4:05 *12-inch single (1991 reissue) :A1. \"Love Is A Stranger\" (The Obsession Remix) 6:32 :A2. \"Love Is A Stranger\" (J.C.
