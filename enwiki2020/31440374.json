    "text": "Historic Kirtland Village, located in Kirtland, Lake County, Ohio, is the name given to a historic site (itself made up of historic buildings and sites important to the early Latter Day Saint movement). The village is owned and operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). ==History== The LDS Church purchased the first property in the village, the Newel K. Whitney Store, in the late 1970s, and restored it in 1984. In the years since then, the LDS Church acquired more historic buildings and property in the area. In April 2000, plans were announced to restore the remaining buildings, while reconstructing others, and building a new visitors center. Following the completion of the project, LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley dedicated the site on May 18, 2003. In 2018, Historic Kirtland Village exhibited nearly 600 nativity displays from around the world as part of an annual Christmas tradition in its 10th year.Ewinger, James. \"Nativity sets from around the world decorate historic Mormon village in Lake County, Ohio\", Cleveland Plain Dealer, 12 January 2019.
