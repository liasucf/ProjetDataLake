However, in December, it was reported that not all of the cast members had been paid yet, including lead actresses Song Ha-yoon and Lee Joo-yeon. Golden Thumb Pictures then promised to pay everyone by December 31. On January 2, 2019, actress Song Ha-yoon's agency JYP Entertainment shared their plans on taking all possible legal action including civil and criminal lawsuits against the parties affiliated with the unpaid wages for Devilish Charm, as they have yet to receive their full payments. Broadcasting company iHQ remarked that the issue has to be settled by Golden Thumb Pictures as the wages are contracted between them and the actors. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * (Dramax) * Official website (MBN) * * Category:Maeil Broadcasting Network television dramas Category:Korean-language television shows Category:2018 South Korean television series debuts Category:2018 South Korean television series endings Category:South Korean romance television series Category:South Korean romantic comedy television series Category:South Korean pre-produced television series ",
