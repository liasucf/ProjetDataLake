    "text": "Paul Johannes Schlesinger (July 9, 1874 \u2014 February 12, 1945) was an Austrian trade unionist and politician. He was a member of the Austrian Parliament from 1926 to 1934, then persecuted by the St\u00e4ndestaat and thereafter by the Nazi Reich. He was killed by the Nazis at KZ Gro\u00df-Rosen three months before the war ended. == Biographical details == Schlesinger was born in Vienna where he also grew up and attended school. He learned the craft of precision mechanics in Vienna, Lundenburg and in St. P\u00f6lten. He then spent his journeyman years all over Europe, working in Hungary, Germany, in the Netherlands, in Belgium and Switzerland. In 1905, he returned to his hometown; shortly thereafter he was elected secretary of the Austrian Association of Metal Workers. He joined the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SdA) and in 1907 became chairman of the Regional Health Insurance in Baden bei Wien. In 1911 and in 1912 he served as a trade union representative for three districts in Lower Austria, for M\u00f6dling, Baden and Wiener Neustadt. In 1921, Schlesinger became member of the regional parliament of Lower Austria where he served for five years. In 1926, he was elected to the Austrian Parliament where he served until 1934 (apart from two months in 1930). After the authoritarian rule of Austrofascism was installed in Austria, Schlesinger was arrested and incarcerated for several months at the Anhaltelager W\u00f6llersdorf. After the Anschluss, the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in March 1938, Schlesinger was arrested again, this time by the Gestapo, and held captive until 1939. On September 1, 1944 he was arrested again. The Nazis still feared the already seventy-year-old unionist and socialist. On September 19, 1944 he was deported to Concentration camp Auschwitz.Stefan Eminger: Nieder\u00f6sterreich im 20. Jahrhundert: Politik.

One of them was Paul Johannes Schlesinger. The plaque is placed on the right side of the main entrance of the building. Also, a residential building in Wiener Neu\u00adstadt was named after Schlesinger. A memorial plaque for Schlesinger can be seen on the building to this day. Since 2010, a Stolperstein in front of the building Herzog Leopold-Strasse 28 (also in Wiener Neustadt) commemorates his deportation and death. == External links == * * Stolpersteine Wiener Neustadt, Stolperstein for Paul Johannes Schlesinger == Sources == Category:1874 births Category:1945 deaths Category:Social Democratic Party of Austria politicians Category:Politicians who died in Nazi concentration camps Category:Resistance members killed by Nazi Germany Category:People who died in Gross-Rosen concentration camp Category:Austrian Resistance members Category:Austrian socialists ",
