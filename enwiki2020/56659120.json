    "text": "The big-scaled redfin (Tribolodon hakonensis), also known as the Japanese dace, is a medium-sized Asian fish. First described by Albert G\u00fcnther in 1877 as Leuciscus hakonensis, it is the type specimen of the genus Tribolodon, having been described again as Tribolodon punctatum by Henri \u00c9mile Sauvage when he established that genus in 1883. It is the most widely distributed of the Tribolodon species, found over much of the Sea of Japan. It is known to carry a number of parasites, including the trematode species Centrocestus armatus (for which it is a second intermediate host), and the copepod species Ergasilus fidiformis, which is carried in the fish's gills. ==References== Category:Tribolodon Category:Fish described in 1877 ",
