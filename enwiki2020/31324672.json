Besides his public career, he was an eminent epigraphist. He studied the Brahmi epigraphy in ancient India. He tried to decipher the Indus script. He suggested a theory of development of the Indian epigraphic system according to the Maheshwara Sutras. He also proposed that the Indus script is akin to the Assyrian cuneiform & both have developed from an ancient Indic script, which he called 'Pre-Ashokan Brahmi'.Decipherment of a pre-A\u015bokan Brahmi writing found engraved on a Babylonian Tablet, J.B.B.R.A.S., N.S.
