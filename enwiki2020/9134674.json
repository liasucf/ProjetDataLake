    "text": "Circus Contraption (founded in 1998) was the name of a one-ring circus, vaudeville and dark cabaret troupe based in Seattle, Washington. The troupe, which employs about a dozen performers, uses live, original music paired with old-style circus performances, heavily influenced by cabaret and vaudeville acts. The shows are conceived for adults and usually feature some mature content. The troupe first performed at the Seattle Fringe Theatre Festival, but soon branched out to other venues around the U.S., including a U.S. tour in 2005. Their local and touring shows, with names like \"Bracing Curative,\" \"Eat Circus,\" \"The Beer, Bread & Cheese Cabaret,\" \"A Raree Show,\" and \"Gallimaufry: An Evening of Jiggery-Pokery,\" played to sold-out audiences. The troupe disbanded in 2009. Joe Albanese (aka Dexter Mantooth) and Drew Keriakedes (aka Shmootzi the Clod) and three other victims were killed in the Cafe Racer shooting on May 30, 2012. == Members == Principal members * Joseph Vito \"Dexter Mantooth\" Albanese \u2013 bassist, leather craftsman * Evelyn \"Acrophelia\" Bittner \u2013 acrobat, costumer, stilt walker * Sari \"Pinky d'Ambrosia\" Breznau \u2013 costumer, vocalist, trumpeter, dancer * Erin Brindley \u2013 managing director * David \"Armitage Shanks\" Crellin \u2013 co-founder, ringmaster, vocalist, percussionist, songwriter, maskmaker, fire-eater * Max \"Fresco Rose\" Davis \u2013 acrobat, aerialist, dancer * Colin \"Ernesto Cellini\" Ernst \u2013 juggler, trombonist, welder, contraption engineer, composer * Kevin \"Chameleo\" Hinshaw \u2013 clarinetist, music director, pianist, composer, webmaster, director of small packages * Jenny \"Nova Jo Yaco\" Iacobucci \u2013 dancer, stilt walker, puppeteer, costumer * Drew \"Shmoozie the Clod\" Keriakedes \u2013 sousaphonist, ukulelist, accordionist, banjo player, vocalist, songwriter * Whitney \"Delphinia Spit\" Lawless \u2013 clown, acrobat, costumer * Matt \"Bunny LaMonte\" Manges \u2013 drummer, aerialist, acrobat, songwriter, stuntman * Kari \"Sally Pepper\" Podgorski \u2013 aerialist, dancer, acrobat, costumer, stilt walker * Terry \"The Carnie\" Podgorski \u2013 production manager, set designer * Orycteropus \"Ory\" Afer \u2013 mascot * Lara \"Darty Kangoo\" Paxton \u2013 co-founder, artistic director, aerialist, dancer, costumer, acrobat, stilt walker, fortune teller * Hugh \"Salamity Clam\" Sutton \u2013 accordionist, pianist * Jeff \"Buster Speck\" Walker \u2013 trombonist * Annastasia \"Esmeralda Diamond\" Workman \u2013 accordion player, piano player * Jason \"Dr. Loligo Calamari\" Williams \u2013 acrobat, rigger, contraption engineer, stilt walker Occasional guest stars * Greg \"Harold Smaude\" Adair \u2013 accordionist, painter and illustrator * Pavel Merzo \u2013 clown * James Jay \u2013 juggler * Melissa Kerber \u2013 aerialist * Spencer and Gary \"The Twins\" Luke \u2013 unknown ==Discography== *Our Latest Catalogue CD (2001) *Gallimaufry CD (2004) *Grand American Traveling Dime Museum CD (2005) *The Half Wit's Descent CD (2008) *The Show to End All Shows CD (2010) ==References== ==External links== *So Long Category:Circuses Category:Dark cabaret musicians Category:Vaudeville ",
