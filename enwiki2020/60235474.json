    "text": "Gold & Grey is the fifth studio album by American heavy metal band Baroness, released on June 14, 2019, on the band's own label, Abraxan Hymns. ==Background== As with previous releases by the band, the album's artwork was designed by front-man and lead singer John Dyer Baizley. The album is the band's first to feature new guitarist Gina Gleason and was mastered by frequent Flaming Lips collaborator Dave Fridmann who also produced Baroness' previous album. The first single from the album, \"Borderlines\", was released in March 2019. The band debuted the album's first single, \"Borderlines\" in Houston at the start of their co-headlining tour with Deafheaven in March 2019. ==Album artwork== As with all previous releases by the band, the cover art was done by front man Baizley and echoes themes seen on prior recordings that prominently feature scantily clad woman intertwined with scenes inspired by nature in a gold and grey color scheme, giving the album its name however, this may possibly be the last of such chromatically-themed album covers from the band. The art work was leaked by music identifying app Shazam which forced Baizley to release it early on the band's Twitter account. ==Critical reception== Gold & Grey was well received and on aggregate website Metacritic, the album received a score of 91/100 from 14 critics indicating universal acclaim. ==Commercial Performance== Gold & Grey debuted at number one on the UK Rock & Metal Albums Chart, the highest chart position achieved by Baroness to date. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * John Dyer Baizley \u2013 lead vocals, backing vocals, rhythm guitar, percussion, piano, artwork * Gina Gleason \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals, keyboards, lead vocals,synthetizer * Nick Jost \u2013 bass, synthesizer, keyboards * Sebastian Thomson \u2013 drums ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) | 52 |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| French Albums (SNEP) | 177 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Spanish Albums (PROMUSICAE) | 57 |- |- |- |} ==External links== * Music video for \"Borderlines\" ==References== Category:2019 albums Category:Baroness (band) albums Category:Albums produced by Dave Fridmann Category:Albums with cover art by John Dyer Baizley Category:Heavy metal albums by American artists Category:Albums recorded at Tarbox Road Studios ",
