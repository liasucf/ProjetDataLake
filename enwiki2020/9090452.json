    "text": "Portals Athletic were a works football team based between the north Hampshire towns of Overton and Whitchurch. The club ran for 60 years until the loss of the sudden loss of their financial backing in 1987. ==History== Portals Athletic FC were founded in 1927 as the works side of the Laverstoke Paper Mill, and initially played in the local Basingstoke League where they enjoyed plenty of success - most notably in 1936\u201337 when they won the Hampshire Junior 'A' Cup. In 1967 Portals were elected to Hampshire League Division 3 where they finished in a respectable mid-table final position. A year later the league was expanded and they were consequently placed in Division 3 West, where they finished 3rd before clinching promotion as runners-up in 1969\u201370. Portals quickly adapted well to life in what was then a highly competitive Division 2 and clinched a final position of 3rd which was enough to secure a second successive promotion. Life in the top flight was tough for Portals and they were relegated straight back again to Division 2 where they remained until the 1983\u201384 season when they bounced back as champions. Portals enjoyed numerous cup successes during this period and quickly consolidated themselves in Division 1 for two seasons until in 1986 they (along with the league's top clubs with the required facilities) broke away to form the new Wessex League.http://www.fchd.info/PORTALSA.HTM In the league's inaugural season Portals finished in a steady 12th position but in 1987 the parent company suddenly withdrew their support, forcing the club to sadly withdraw from the competition and disband just after celebrating their 60th anniversary. Another sad loss to non-league football. The Portals ground at Laverstoke Park, located alongside the B3400 between Whitchurch and Overton, remained in use after the clubs untimely demise. During the 1999\u20132000 season it was leased to the short-lived Hampshire League side AFC Basingstoke. ==Honours== *Hampshire League Division 2 **Champions 1983/84 *Hampshire League Division 3 West **Runners-up 1969/70 *Hampshire FA Intermediate Cup **Winners 1939/40 and 1980/81 *Hampshire FA Junior 'A' Cup **Winners 1936/37 *North Hants Senior Cup **Winners 1979/80, 1980/81 and 1982/83 *North Hants May Cup **Winners 1947/48 ==Records== === League === {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=text-align:center !Season !Division !Position !Significant events |- |1967/68||Hampshire League Division 3||10/16|| |- |1968/69||Hampshire League Division 3 West||3/14|| |- |1969/70||Hampshire League Division 3 West||2/14||Runners-up, Promoted |- |1970/71||Hampshire League Division 2||3/16||Promoted |- |1971/72||Hampshire League Division 1||15/16||Relegated |- |1972/73||Hampshire League Division 2||10/16|| |- |1973/74||Hampshire League Division 2||13/16|| |- |1974/75||Hampshire League Division 2||10/16|| |- |1975/76||Hampshire League Division 2||7/16|| |- |1976/77||Hampshire League Division 2||11/16|| |- |1977/78||Hampshire League Division 2||8/16|| |- |1978/79||Hampshire League Division 2||8/16|| |- |1979/80||Hampshire League Division 2||8/16|| |- |1980/81||Hampshire League Division 2||3/20|| |- |1981/82||Hampshire League Division 2||4/20|| |- |1982/83||Hampshire League Division 2||4/20|| |- |1983/84||Hampshire League Division 2||1/18||Champions, Promoted |- |1984/85||Hampshire League Division 1||17/20|| |- |1985/86||Hampshire League Division 1||8/20||Left competition |- |1986/87||Wessex League ||12/17||Left competition |} ==Famous Players== In the early fifties, locally born Brian Clifton played for Portals before enjoying a long professional career with Southampton and Grimsby Town. Latterly, the former Leicester City and Southampton defender Ian White played for the club from 1968 to 1972 and for a spell was their player-manager. ==References== Category:Defunct football clubs in England Category:Association football clubs established in 1927 Category:1927 establishments in England Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 1987 Category:1987 disestablishments in England Category:Basingstoke and District Football League Category:North Hants League Category:Hampshire League Category:Wessex Football League Category:Defunct football clubs in Hampshire ",
