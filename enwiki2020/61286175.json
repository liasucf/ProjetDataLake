    "text": "Al-Jinan (, meaning \"The Gardens\") was an Arabic-language political and literary bi-weekly magazine established in Beirut by Butrus al-Bustani and active between 1860 and 1886. Written largely by Butrus' son Salim, \"it finally ceased to appear because of the growing difficulties of writing freely under the rule of Abd\u00fclhamid.\" It was the first important example of the kind of literary and scientific periodicals which began to appear in the 1870s in Arabic alongside the independent political newspapers. ==References== Category:1860 establishments in the Ottoman Empire Category:1886 disestablishments in the Ottoman Empire Category:Arabic-language magazines Category:Biweekly magazines Category:Defunct literary magazines Category:Defunct magazines published in Lebanon Category:Defunct political magazines Category:Magazines established in 1860 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1886 Category:Magazines published in Beirut ",
