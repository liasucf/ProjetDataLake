Olid leads the conquest of Jal-ixco (Jalisco), 1522. From Lienzo de Tlaxcala Born in Baeza, Olid grew up in the household of the governor of Cuba, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar. In 1518 Vel\u00e1zquez sent Olid to relieve Juan de Grijalva, but en route a hurricane caused the loss of Olid's anchors, and he returned to Cuba. On January 10, 1519, Olid sailed with Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s's fleet, as his quartermaster, and took an active part in the conquest of Mexico.Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, He fought at the Battle of Otumba on 14 July 1520, and also took part in the campaign against the Pur\u00e9pechas. During the Siege of Tenochtitlan, Crist\u00f3bal was one of Cort\u00e9s' key captains, playing a critical role in the capture of Xochimilco. Cristobal was the Texcoco camp commander during the trial of Antonio de Villafana, for his plot to assassinate Cortes. Cristobal commanded one of four forces under Cortes, and acted as quartermaster. Olid helped save Cortes at one point, when he was seized by the Mexicans in one of the causeway battles. Cort\u00e9s sent Olid to Michoacan, after he had married a Portuguese lady. In 1522, Olid led Spanish soldiers with Tlaxcalan allies in the conquests of Jalisco and Colima in West Mexico .Crist\u00f3bal de Olid, 1522 In 1523, Cort\u00e9s made Olid the leader of an expedition to conquer Honduras, but while resupplying in Havana, Olid (at a suggestion by Vel\u00e1zquez) declared his independence from New Spain and set out to conquer Honduras for himself. Landing east of Puerto Caballos, he founded the settlement of Triunfo de la Cruz. Many of Olid's supporters moved to Naco, where there was good agricultural land and gold. When Cort\u00e9s learnt of Olid's rebellion, he sent Francisco de Las Casas against Olid with two warships. Despite the fact that both these ships were destroyed in a storm and many of his soldiers defected to Olid, Las Casas defeated Olid in battle and captured him. Accounts of how Olid died vary; Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo asserts in his Verdadera Historia de la Conquista de Nueva Espa\u00f1a that Las Casas had him beheaded at Naco, while Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas wrote that Olid's own soldiers rose up against and then murdered him. ==See also== * Gonzalo de Sandoval * Pedro de Alvarado ==References== Category:1487 births Category:1524 deaths Category:People from Zaragoza Category:Spanish conquistadors Category:Colonial Mexico Category:16th-century Spanish people Category:Aztec Category:History of the Aztecs ",
