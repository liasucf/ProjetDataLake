In Act Zero and the Special Act, she was credited as \"Rika\" (\u68a8\u83ef; note different kanji than her current stage name). She released a CD \"single\", containing two songs, for her character Sailor Mercury: Mi Amor (Spanish: my love) and Yakusoku (\u7d04\u675f, meaning promise).

She was on the cover of three consecutive issues of Pure Pure or Pure\u00b2, a magazine aimed at the under- fifteen crowd (Issues 17 to 19, her photos were along with those of many other like-aged idols). She had released a single in November 2003 for a song entitled \"Koisuru Soldier\" (Kanojo wa Ijiwaru [\"Nasty Girl\"] was the other song on that CD; it was released on her agency's label and distributed by Windsong). She was also in a magazine called Bomb! with Miyuu Sawai and Keiko Kitagawa in character as Sailor Mercury. After PGSM, Izumi's career went on hiatus for two years as she finished high school. No new photos of her surfaced, and when she attended PGSM cast reunions, her ex-castmates were careful not to post her full name in blogs nor post photos of her. When she was accepted at Meiji University as a literature major in 2007 (the same university ex-PGSM castmate Kitagawa attended), she resumed her career. In June 2008, Rika returned to the modeling world after years of inactivity.\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bb\u30b9PINKY\u30aa\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3/PINKY/s-woman.net/\u96c6\u82f1\u793e .
