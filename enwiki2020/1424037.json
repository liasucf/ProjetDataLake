Bactrian legend \u039f\u03b7\u03f8\u03bf Kushan worshipper with Oesho, Bactria, 3rd century CE.Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition Oesho () was a Kushan deity represented on Kushan coins. He was apparently one of the titular deities of the dynasty. He is generally identified with Shiva. By the time of the Kushan emperor Ooishki (Bactrian \u039f\u03bf\u03b7\u03f8\u03ba\u03b9; often Romanised as Huvishka), who reigned in 140\u2013180 CE, Oesho and the female deity Ardoksho (Ardoxsho; Ardochsho; Ardokhsho) were the only deities appearing on Kushan coins. Connections to several contemporaneous deities worshipped by neighbouring cultures have been suggested. * During the Kushan era, Oesho was often linked to the Hindu concept of Ishvara, which was embodied by the god Shiva;Sivaramamurti, p. 56-59. Oesho may share the same etymology as Ishvara and/or represent a variant of the word in the Bactrian language spoken by the Kushans. * Similarities have retrospectively been identified with the Avestan Vayu.H. Humbach, 1975, p.402-408. K.Tanabe, 1997, p.277, M.Carter, 1995, p.152. J.Cribb, 1997, p.40. References cited in \"De l'Indus \u00e0 l'Oxus\". * Some later representations, evidently influenced by Greco-Bactrian culture, depict Oesho with a trishula, the traditional implement of Shiva, similar to a trident that is part of Poseidon\u2019s iconography.Coins of Vima Kadphises File:Vasudeva I Circa CE 190-230 Oesho reverse.jpg|Oesho, with a second human face, and the head of a horned animal Image:Coin of KanishkaII.jpg|Coin of the Kushan king Kanishka II with, on the reverse, a depiction of Oesho and the word \"Oesho\" in modified Greek script. ==Notes== == References == * Category:South Asian deities Category:Kushan Empire ",
