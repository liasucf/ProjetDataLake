Edison, Inc. including Conquest Pictures programs. Its New York studio was at 2826 Decatur Avenue, Bronx, NY when Thomas Edison exited his struggling film production business. Originally built for silent films, the facility was upgraded for sound in 1930, and continued in operation until the 1960s. Edison's son Charles Edison was to serve on the acquiring firm's board of directors. Thomas Edison was to be a consulting editor. Violoncellist Harrison Gibbs Prentice worked for the company. The deal also included equipment from the Edison Positive plant in Orange, New Jersey and a million feet of negatives. ==Filmography== *Chicago Stock Yards (1917), a newsreel clipping *Cotton Manufacture (1917), a newsreel clipping *The Canadian Rockies (1917), a newsreel clipping ==References== Category:Defunct American film studios Category:Defunct companies based in New York City Category:Defunct companies based in Massachusetts Category:Companies based in Worcester, Massachusetts Category:Companies disestablished in the 1960s ",
