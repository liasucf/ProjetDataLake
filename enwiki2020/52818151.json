One ship, , is preserved as a museum ship in Stockholm, Sweden. ==History== The ships were ordered in 1961 as part of a re-armament programme for defending Sweden's coastline. Tenders were sought from various European boat builders in the United Kingdom, Norway and Germany including Lurssen who offered the new Jaguar-class design. The Swedes ended up designing a bespoke vessel which became the template for subsequent Swedish fast attack craft. ==Design== The hull was made of steel, unlike some other contemporary designs which used plywood. Although the boat had a relatively small hull and displacement, this provided a stable platform. The Bridge and Operations Room were located at the rolling and stamping centre of the ship which further improved stability for the crew especially in high seas. The boats were fitted with a NBC support system where the hull could be closed down in the event of having to operate in a nuclear fall-out area. ===Machinery=== The machinery consisted of three shafts powered by British built, Bristol Proteus gas turbines. Three MTU gas turbines were also installed as auxiliary generators ===Armament=== The torpedo armament consisted of six torpedo tubes which were positioned at an angle. Hydrogen-peroxide propelled, wire guided torpedoes were used. The gun armament consisted of a single Bofors 57 mm gun, which was capable of firing 200 rounds per minute over an effective range of . The gun could engage both surface and airborne targets. There were also six and four rocket launchers capable of firing chaff, infrared countermeasures and illuminating projectiles (starshell). The torpedo boats had a scanning and a fire control radar with a basic fire control computer. There were plans to replace the torpedo tubes with anti-ship missiles in the 1980s but these plans were cancelled. ==Ships== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Number !! Name !! Builder !! Launched !!
