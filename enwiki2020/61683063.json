    "text": "Urban Bruun J\u00fcrgensen (5 August 1776 - 14 May 1830) was a Danish watchmaker. His company is now called Jules J\u00fcrgensen after one of his two sons and is based in Switzerland. ==Early life and education== J\u00fcrgensen was born on 5 August 1776 in Copenhagen, the son of royal watchmaker J\u00f8rgen J\u00f8rgensen (1745\u20131811) and Anne Leth Bruun (1755\u20131828). He attended Eftersl\u00e6gtens skole where his teachers included Edvard Storm and Knud Lyhne Rahbek. J\u00fcrgensen was in the same time a watchmaker's apprentice in his father's workshop. Aged 20, he went on a five-year journey abroad with economic support from Fonden ad usus publicos and Det Reiersenske Fond. He spent one and a half year in Neuch\u00e2tel and half a year in Switzerland before continuing to Paris and then London. He then returned to Paris. ==Career== J\u00fcrgensen returned to Copenhagen in 1801. He was supposed to enter into a partnership with a French watchmaker, Etienne Magnin, who had been called to Denmark to construct the next chronometers for the shipping industry. These plans changed when watchmaker continued to Saint Petersburg and J\u00fcrgensen then joined his father's workshop. In 1804, he published Regler for Tidens n\u00f8jagtige Afmaaling ved Uhre. It was the following year published in an improved edition in French. It was followed by a German translation. In 1804, he was also awarded the Academy of Sciences' silver medal for a publication about mainsprings published in one of its journals. In 1705, he was awarded Landhusholdningsselskabet's large gold medal for a metal thermometer. In 1807, weakened by gard work and personal griefs (the death of several children), he left Copenhagen for Neuch\u00e2tel where he stayed for two and a half years. He brough an extensive collection of machines and instruments back to Denmark which was the largest of its kind in the country. He was accompanied by a team of Swiss watchmakers which replaced his poorly trained Danish employees. In Geneva, he had been able to study the art of perforating precious stones, a technique which had for many years been kept secret. J\u00fcrgensen was also the first in Denmark to make cylindrical wheels in steel instead of brass. J\u00fcrgensen continued the workshop alone after his father's death in 1811. Over a twenty-year period, he only manufactured around fifty chronometers. In 1815, he was elected for the Academy of Sciences. This was an unusual honour for a craftsman. ==Personal life and legacy== Louis Urban J\u00fcrgensen (1806-1867) He was engaged to Sophie Henriette (31 January 1780, Locle - 24 January 1852, Copenhagen) in Neuch\u00e2tel, and they were married on 12 May 1801 in Peseux. She was a daughter of watchmaker Jacques Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Henriette (1743\u20131830) and Henriette Courvoisier (1753\u201388). He died on 14 May 1830 and is buried at the French Reformed Chyurch in Copenhagen. The Urban J\u00fcrgensen shop in Gothersgade in Copenhagen 1863 J\u00fcrgensen's two sons, Jules- Frederik J\u00fcrgensen and Louis Urban J\u00fcrgensen, continued the family tradition. Jules studied in Switzerland, while his brother Louis remained in charge of the workshop in Copenhagen. The company is now called Jules Jurgensen. == References == ==External links== * Urban J\u00fcrgensen Collection Category:Danish watchmakers (people) Category:Danish clockmakers Category:19th-century Danish artisans Category:People from Copenhagen Category:1776 births Category:1830 Category:1830 deaths ",
