    "text": "Grayfolded is a two-CD album produced by John Oswald featuring the Grateful Dead song \"Dark Star\". Using over a hundred different performances of the song, recorded live between 1968 and 1993, Oswald, using a process he calls \"plunderphonics\", built, layered, and \"folded\" all of them to produce two large, recomposed versions, each about one hour long. The first disc of Grayfolded, titled Transitive Axis, was released in 1994, and the second disc, Mirror Ashes, was released in 1995, both on the Swell/Artifacts label. The two discs were released together in 1996.\"Grayfolded: Mirror Ashes, Grateful Dead Family Discography. Retrieved August 4, 2014.

Grayfolded is one of only three Grateful Dead albums that features the participation of every musician who was ever in the group, the others being the box sets So Many Roads (1965\u20131995) and 30 Trips Around the Sun (as well as the latter's 4-disc version). ==Production== In an interview in 1995 Oswald described how the project came about: > Phil Lesh called me up and talked me into doing it. At that point, I hadn't > listened to any Grateful Dead music in about twenty years. I did think I was > qualified, because I do think it's often a good idea to come into a project > without a lot of prior knowledge and get kind of an alien's overview of what > the music seems to be, and then put in your own two cents of what you think > it should be.

On another occasion Oswald said that he had been asked by musician and journalist David Gans to produce something very short, he explained his response to this suggestion: > What interested me most about the Grateful Dead was their extended playing > style. I wrote a counter-proposal to David saying, 'Well, I've been thinking > about it and all I can hear is the opposite - something very long.Grayfolded > CD booklet notes, page 1 ==Critical reception== On AllMusic, Lindsay Planer said, \"[John Oswald's] uncanny compositions\u2014which he terms \"plunderphonics\"\u2014are sculpted by morphing and layering multiple incarnations of a song to make a thoroughly unique version.... While it may not be everyone's blend of surreal sonic psychedelics, Grayfolded is well executed and worthy of inclusion in any Deadhead collection.\" ==Track listing== ;Disc 1 \u2013 Transitive Axis # \"Novature (Formless Nights Fall)\" \u2013 1:19 # \"Pouring Velvet\" \u2013 2:58 # \"In Revolving Ash Light\" \u2013 17:00 # \"Clouds Cast\" \u2013 7:13 # \"Through\" \u2013 8:52 # \"Fault Forces\" \u2013 6:19 # \"The Phil Zone\" \u2013 4:45 # \"La Estrella Oscura\" \u2013 9:33 # \"Recedes (While We Can)\" \u2013 1:56 ;Disc 2 \u2013 Mirror Ashes # * \"Fold\" \u2013 2:10 (hidden track) # \"Transilience\" \u2013 0:07 # \"73rd Star Bridge Sonata\" \u2013 13:41 # \"Cease Tone Beam\" \u2013 12:45 # \"The Speed of Space\" \u2013 8:49 # \"Dark Matter Problem/Every Leaf Is Turning\" \u2013 6:42 # \"Foldback Time\" \u2013 1:33 ==Personnel== *Jerry Garcia \u2013 lead guitar, vocals *Bob Weir \u2013 rhythm guitar, vocals *Phil Lesh \u2013 bass, vocals *Bill Kreutzmann \u2013 drums *Mickey Hart \u2013 drums *Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan \u2013 keyboards, vocals, harmonica, percussion *Tom Constanten \u2013 keyboards *Keith Godchaux \u2013 keyboards *Donna Jean Godchaux \u2013 vocals *Bruce Hornsby \u2013 piano, keyboards, vocals *Brent Mydland \u2013 keyboards, vocals *Vince Welnick \u2013 keyboards, vocals *John Oswald \u2013 arranger == References == ==External links== * Grayfolded flash promo * Grayfolded release sheet in pdf format: Grayfolded.pdf Lightshow.pdf Category:Grateful Dead live albums Category:Grateful Dead compilation albums Category:1994 live albums Category:1994 compilation albums Category:Experimental rock compilation albums Category:Live experimental rock albums Category:John Oswald (composer) albums ",
