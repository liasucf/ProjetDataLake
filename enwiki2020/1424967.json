    "text": "Two elections in Ireland took place in 1921, as a result of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 to establish the House of Commons of Northern Ireland and the House of Commons of Southern Ireland. The election was used by Irish Republicans as the basis of membership of the Second D\u00e1il. Where contested, the elections used single transferable vote. ==Southern Ireland result== No actual polling took place in Southern Ireland as all 128 candidates were returned unopposed. Of these, 124 were won by Sinn F\u00e9in and four by independent Unionists representing the University of Dublin (Trinity College). When the date of the elections was announced in the House of Commons, the Conservative MP Sir William Davison, who had been born in Broughshane, County Antrim, had asked \"What is the object of holding elections in Southern Ireland when any candidates who do not support Sinn Fein would be shot?\" Other members had replied \"How do you know?\" John Dillon and T. P. O'Connor both agreed that the Irish Party should not fight Sinn F\u00e9in for seats for the Southern parliament as things stood.Catholic Belfast and Nationalist Ireland in the Era of Joe Devlin, 1871-1934 p.226 Former Irish Parliamentary Party MP Stephen Gwynn, now a member of the Irish Dominion League, advocated putting up League candidates against Sinn F\u00e9in. In early March he met with southern Unionists Viscount Midleton and Lord Oranmore, requesting them to pool their resources to contest the election and contest the election on a platform opposing the IRA's violence, under Midleton's leadership. Midleton declined the invitation, just as he had declined a previous request for his Unionist Anti-Partition League to join the Dominion League.Stephen Gwynn and the failure of constitutional nationalism in Ireland, pp. 741\u2013742 A single Unionist candidate had been selected to contest the constituency of Donegal: Major Robert L Moore, who had contested East Donegal in 1918.The Evening Leader, Corning, NY, 22 April 1921, P2 Moore however later withdrew his candidacy just before the election.The Sunday Oregonian.

The total number of members who assembled in the Second D\u00e1il was 125: 119 elected solely in Southern Ireland, 1 solely in Northern Ireland (Se\u00e1n O'Mahony), and 5 in both. In Southern Ireland, there were fresh elections in 1922 as a result of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. ==Northern Ireland result== The general election to the Northern Ireland House of Commons occurred on 24 May. Of 52 seats, including Queen's University of Belfast, 40 were won by Unionists, 6 by moderate nationalists and 6 by Sinn F\u00e9in. {| class=\"wikitable font-size: 95%;\" |- ! colspan=\"7\" | 1921 Northern Ireland general election |- ! style=\"background-color:white;\" colspan=7| 360px |- ! colspan=\"2\"|Party !
