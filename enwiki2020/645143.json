    "text": "Monolithic is a synthpop music project started and maintained by Michael Babbitt. Its music includes subgenres such as breakbeat, trance, EBM, techno, industrial, and downtempo. Monolithic's music has been described as \"intense\", \"meaningful\", \"emotional\", and \"powerful.\" In January 2006, Babbitt announced that he was canceling his then-upcoming Monolithic album Evil Behind Smiling Eyes to focus on other projects. ==MIDIhead== Michael (MIDIhead) Babbitt is sole member of Monolithic. He started his music career at the age of 14 when he went to a Battle of the DJs with a box of cassette tapes. He did poorly at his first performance, coming in last place, but he learned from the experience and later trained under more experienced DJs. At eighteen he helped a friend start a nightclub called The Ivy Tower which was housed in a former church. In 2000, Babbitt released his first solo album under the moniker of Monolithic. This album won Best Album of 2001 at the American Synthpop awards in Hollywood. His award was presented by former Information Society frontman, Kurt Harland at the famed Hotel Rosevelt Hotel ballroom. Babbitt has worked on remixes, TV, and motion picture trailers, such as Access Hollywood, MTV, The Matrix Reloaded, Dark Angel, America's Next Top Model, Prison Break, Dexter to name a few, as well as multiple Dance, Dance, Revolution video games. In addition to writing and producing music, Babbitt also has experience in sound design and has created patch libraries for Spectrasonics Omnisphere, distributed by ILIO. His latest release called \"Anthology\" is a collection of 32 songs, spanning 20 years of songwriting under his Monolithic moniker and can be found at many online music streaming and digital download providers. == Discography == === as Monolithic === ==== Full-length albums ==== * Power Undiminished (2000) * Dividing Asunder (2002) * Fall Awake - EP (2010) * Evil Behind Smiling Eyes (2014) * Illumina Tenebris (2016) * Anthology (2018) ==== Singles ==== * Lulling Us to Sleep (2002) * House of Joy (2002) ==== Other ==== * Evil Behind Smiling Eyes - Collection 1 [Limited MP3-only pre-release of the full-length album] (2005) * In My Eyes (Midihead Remix) (2004) Original song by Akira Yamaoka. === as Midihead === * Midihead EP (2009 Fixt) == References == Online music providers for Monolithic/MIDIhead reference Dance, Dance, Revolution Ultramix 2 MIDIhead reference Dance, Dance, Revolution Ultramix 3 MIDIhead references Dance, Dance, Revolution Universe MIDIhead and Monolithic references Monolithic, BMI MIDIhead, BMI ==External links== *Official Web site Category:American synth-pop groups Category:Video game musicians ",
