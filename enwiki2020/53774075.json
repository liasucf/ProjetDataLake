It is endemic to alpine areas of Victoria and New South Wales, where it inhabits bogs and seepages. Griseargiolestes intermedius is a medium-sized damselfly, black- green metallic in colour with pale markings; adults are slightly pruinescent. Like other members of the family Megapodagrionidae it rests with its wings outspread. Griseargiolestes intermedius appears similar to Griseargiolestes griseus, which occurs further north into New South Wales. ==Gallery== Griseargiolestes intermedius female (11994354143).jpg | Tip of female tail Griseargiolestes intermedius male (11869921135).jpg | Tip of male tail Griseargiolestes intermedius female wings (34696062401).jpg | Female wings Griseargiolestes intermedius male wings (34696068431).jpg | Male wings ==See also== * List of Odonata species of Australia == References == Category:Megapodagrionidae Category:Odonata of Australia Category:Insects of Australia Category:Endemic fauna of Australia Category:Taxa named by Robert John Tillyard Category:Insects described in 1913 Category:Damselflies ",
