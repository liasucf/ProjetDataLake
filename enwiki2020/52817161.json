    "text": "P\u014dmare II (?\u20131850) was originally called Whiria. He was a M\u0101ori rangatira (chief) of the Ng\u0101puhi iwi (tribe) in New Zealand and the leader of the Ng\u0101ti Manu hapu (subtribe) of the Ng\u0101puhi. He was the nephew of P\u014dmare I. His mother, Haki, was the elder sister of P\u014dmare I. When he succeeded his uncle as leader of the Ng\u0101ti Manu he took his uncle's names, Whetoi and P\u014dmare. He is referred to as P\u014dmare II, so as to distinguish him from his uncle. ==Girls\u2019 War (1830)== In 1830, P\u014dmare II's position as the principal chief of the Ng\u0101ti Manu was consolidated during the Girls\u2019 War, which is the name given to fighting on the beach at Russell, New Zealand, then known as Koror\u0101reka, in March 1830 between northern and southern hap\u016b of the Ng\u0101puhi. P\u014dmare II supported Kiwikiwi, the chief of the Ng\u0101ti Manu hap\u016b of Koror\u0101reka, when northern hap\u016b led by Ururoa (also known as Rewharewha), a chief of Whangaroa and brother-in-law of the late Hongi Hika, raided the k\u016bmara gardens at Koror\u0101reka on 5 March 1830. Ururoa was supported by other chiefs from the various northern hap\u016b, including Hone Heke and Rewa of the Ng\u0101ti Tawake hap\u016b of Kerikeri. Henry Williams, William Williams and other members of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) came over the bay from Paihia to attempt to mediate an end to the fighting. The mediation efforts appeared promising, with the missionaries believing that the chiefs would accept that the plunder of the k\u016bmara gardens at Koror\u0101reka would suffice as satisfaction of the earlier insults to Pehi, the daughter of Hongi Hika, and Moewaka, the daughter of Rewa (the reason the battle is called the Girls\u2019 War). However, further fighting occurred, which resulted in the death of Hengi, a chief of Whangaroa. Eventually Henry Williams persuaded the warriors to stop the fighting. Reverend Samuel Marsden had arrived on a visit and over the following weeks he and Henry Williams attempted to negotiate a settlement in which Koror\u0101reka would be ceded by P\u014dmare II to T\u012btore as compensation for the death of Hengi, which was accepted by those engaged in the fighting. ==Events from the Girls' War to the Treaty of Waitangi== P\u014dmare II strengthened his p\u0101 at Otuihu to make it impregnable against any attack by the northern hapu of the Ng\u0101puhi who now controlled Koror\u0101reka and he also worked to promote trade with the Europeans, who were described by Samual Marsden as \"generally men of the most infamous character: runaway convicts, and sailors, and publicans, who have opened grogshops in the pas, where riot, drunkenness, and prostitution are carried out daily\". He quarreled with European settlors and seized their possessions as compensation. He seized Captain James Clendon's whaleboat in 1832. However, he was usually on friendly terms with Clendon.Te Ara, An Encyclopedia of New Zealand 1966: James Reddy Clendon He also seized Thomas King's boat in 1833. The latter event led to the mediation of the dispute by Henry Williams and the intervention of James Busby, the British Resident, which resulted in HMS Alligator anchoring off P\u014dmare's p\u0101 at Otuihu. He also fought a three-month war with T\u012btore in 1837, until a peace agreement was negotiated by Tareha. H\u014dne Heke fought with T\u012btore against P\u014dmare II. An underlying cause of the fighting was a dispute as to the boundary line of the Koror\u0101reka block that had been surrendered as a consequence of the death of Hengi some seven years previously in the Girls\u2019 War. P\u014dmare II signed the Treaty of Waitangi on 17 February 1840. ==Flagstaff War - attack on the p\u0101 of P\u014dmare II== HMS North Star destroying the P\u0101 of P\u014dmare II, 1845. Painting by John Williams. Customs duties were put in place in 1841, which H\u014dne Heke and P\u014dmare II viewed as damaging the maritime trade from which they benefited - each levied visiting ships a fee to anchor in the Bay of Islands and the imposition of the customs duties resulted in whaling and sealing ships choosing to avoid the Bay of Islands. While P\u014dmare II had grievances as to the actions of the colonial government following the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, he did not support H\u014dne Heke's actions in what is known as the Flagstaff War. After the Battle of Koror\u0101reka on 11 March 1845, when H\u014dne Heke and Te Ruki Kawiti and their warriors sacked Koror\u0101reka and Heke cut down the flagstaff, the colonial government attempted to re-establish its authority. On 28 March 1845, troops, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel William Hulme, arrived in the Bay of Islands. The following day the colonial forces attacked the p\u0101 of P\u014dmare II, notwithstanding his position of neutrality. The reason for the attack was what were claimed to be treasonous letters from P\u014dmare to P\u014dtatau Te Wherowhero that had been intercepted. As the p\u0101 at Otuihu was on the coast, cannon fire from HMS North Star was directed at the p\u0101. The colonial forces were able to occupy P\u014dmare's p\u0101 without a fight. When they arrived at P\u014dmare's P\u0101, the chief himself came down to see what all the fuss was about and was promptly made prisoner. He then ordered his warrior not to resist the British and the warriors escaped into the surrounding bush. This left the British a free hand to loot and burn the p\u0101. This action caused considerable puzzlement since up until that time P\u014dmare had been considered neutral, by himself and almost everyone else. When they burnt the p\u0101 the British also burnt two pubs or grog shops which P\u014dmare had established within his p\u0101 to encourage the P\u0101keh\u0101 settlers, sailors, whalers etc. to visit and trade with him. P\u014dmare was taken to Auckland on the North Star. He was released after the intervention of T\u0101mati W\u0101ka Nene and he was paid compensation. He remained neutral in the conflict between H\u014dne Heke and Te Ruki Kawiti against the colonial forces and their Ng\u0101puhi allies, who were led by T\u0101mati W\u0101ka Nene. ==Legacy== P\u014dmare II became a Christian. He died in July or August 1850. Hare Pomare (?-1864) was the son of P\u014dmare II. == Footnotes == Category:1850 deaths Category:People from the Northland Region Category:Musket Wars Category:M\u0101ori Category:Ng\u0101puhi ",
