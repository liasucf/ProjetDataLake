It was the Crimson Tide's 93rd overall and 52nd season as a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The team was led by head coach Ray Perkins, in his third year, and played their home games at both Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa and Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama. They finished the season with a record of nine wins, two losses and one tie (9\u20132\u20131 overall, 4\u20131\u20131 in the SEC) and with a victory in the Aloha Bowl over USC. Highlights of the 1985 season included a last-second, 20\u201316 comeback victory on Labor Day over Georgia to open the season. The 1985 edition of the Iron Bowl against Auburn is regarded as one of Alabama's most dramatic victories in the history of the series. In the game, Alabama led 16\u201310 after three quarters, but saw four lead changes in the fourth quarter, including two in the final minute.1985 Game Recaps, Game No. 11 It ended with Van Tiffin's 52-yard field goal as time expired to give Alabama a 25\u201323 victory. Tiffin's field goal is remembered simply as \"The Kick\" in Alabama lore. Due to NCAA sanctions that led to the forfeit of Alabama's 1993 17\u201317 tie with Tennessee, and college football's adoption of an overtime that does not allow ties, the 14\u201314 tie with LSU remains the last official tie in school history. ==Schedule== :Source: Rolltide.com All-time Football Results: 1985 Season ==Roster== ==Game summaries== ===at LSU=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 32\u201312\u20134 | 1984 | T, 14\u201314 |} ===Auburn=== Van Tiffin kicked his fourth field goal of the game, from 52 yards out, as time expired to give Alabama the Iron Bowl victory.
