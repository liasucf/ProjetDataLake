    "text": "Miss Mac Baren is a song written by G\u00f6ran Lagerberg, Anders T\u00f6pel, Tommy Tausis, Danne Larsson and Tommy Blom. It was first recorded by their band Tages, released as a single in November 1966. The single was recorded during the sessions for their third studio album, Extra Extra, but was ultimately excluded from it. The B-side, \"Get Up An' Get Going\" was however included as the fourth track of the album. \"Miss Mac Baren\" got its first album release on Tages Hits Vol. 3, a compilation album released in August 1967. == Background == The single originated by the band during their Scandinavian tour. After a show in Odense, Denmark, they were phoned by their record label, Platina Records that the Beatles had recently release a single (most likely \"Yellow Submarine\" / \"Eleanor Rigby\"). Since the band at the time were considered the west coast Beatles, Tages were considered the Beatles greatest rivals in Sweden. They were unsure of what to record, but when Danne Larsson was sitting at a bar with them, he spotted an ad for Mac Baren Tobacco, which stuck to him. The song was subsequently written on a tour bus in Southern Sweden during their way home from Denmark, and was apparently inspired by a currently unidentified Finnish rock group which Tages had heard in 1965 during a tour there. It was subsequently recorded once they'd gotten back to Stockholm and Europafilm Studio, in Solna. The odd sound of the introduction and ending were conceived by Blom, who had crawled in under a piano and played it with a pick. \"Miss Mac Baren\" was recorded and released as a single in November 1966, a release that coincided with their third studio album Extra Extra. It instantly became a chart hit, reaching number one on Kv\u00e4llstoppen in the early weeks of 1967 (becoming their second to do so, after \"In My Dreams\", and number four on Tio I Topp. The B-Side, \"Get Up An' Get Goin'\" was written by Anders Henriksson and Thorstein Bergman (under the pseudonyms F. Akon and F. Thokon) == Personnel == === Tages === * Tommy Blom \u2013 co-lead vocals, percussion * G\u00f6ran Lagerberg \u2013 co-lead vocals, bass guitar * Anders T\u00f6pel \u2013 lead guitar * Danne Larsson \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals * Tommy Tausis \u2013 drums === Other === * Anders Henriksson \u2013 piano, keyboards, backing vocals, producer ==Chart positions== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! align=\"center\" |Chart (1966-1967) ! align=\"center\" |Peak position |- | align=\"left\" |Sweden (Kv\u00e4llstoppen) | align=\"center\" |1 |- | align=\"left\" |Sverige (Tio I Topp) | align=\"center\" |4 |} == References == Category:1966 singles Category:English-language Swedish songs Category:1966 songs Category:Tages (band) songs ",
