Its main characters are Agnes Lukauskaite, a second-generation Jewish immigrant from Lithuania researching far-right populism for her MA thesis in history at the University of Iceland; her boyfriend \u00d3mar Arnarson, a graduate in Icelandic linguistics left unemployed by the 2008 Icelandic financial crisis; and Arn\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson, a PhD-student in history and a far-right activist, who becomes Agnes's love-interest later in the novel. The novel intercalates musings in the narratorial voice about racism and right-wing populism, along with an account of Agnes's grandparents' experience of the Holocaust from their home town of Jurbarkas.S\u00f3lveig \u00c1sta Sigur\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir, 'Landvistarleyfi \u00ed b\u00f3kmenntaheiminum: Birtingarmyndir innflytjenda \u00ed \u00edslenskum samt\u00edmask\u00e1lds\u00f6gum' (unpublished MA thesis, University of Iceland, 2015), p. 37; http://skemman.is/is/item/view/1946/21030. ==Translations== * Illska, la maldad, trans. by Enrique Bern\u00e1rdez (Xix\u00f3n, Asturies: Hoja de Lata, 2018) [Spanish] * Zlo, trans. by Daria Lazi\u0107 (Zagreb: Oceanmore, 2018) [Croatian] * Illska: To kako, trans. by Roula Georga Kopoulou (Athens: Polis, 2017) [Greek] * Illska: le mal, trans. by Eric Boury (Paris: M\u00e9taili\u00e9, 2015) [French] * B\u00f6se, trans. by Betty Wahl and Tina Flecken (Stuttgart: Tropen, 2014) [German] * Ondska, trans. by Anna Gunnarsd\u00f3ttir Gr\u00f6nberg (Malm\u00f6: R\u00e1mus, 2014) [Swedish] * Ondskab, trans. by Nanna Kalkar (K\u00f8benhavn: Ordenes By, 2013) [Danish] ==References== Category:2012 novels Category:Icelandic novels Category:Novels set in Iceland Category:Icelandic books Category:Icelandic-language novels ",
