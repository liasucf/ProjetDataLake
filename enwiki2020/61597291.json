    "text": "300px The Murder of the Bishop of Li\u00e8ge is an 1828 or 1829 oil on canvas painting by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, showing the murder of Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Li\u00e8ge by William I de La Marck's men during the 15th-century Wars of Li\u00e8ge, as told in chapter 22 of Walter Scott's historical novel Quentin Durward. First exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1831, it is now in the Louvre in Paris. Its violent subject is typical of French Romantic painting and places it alongside the same artist's The Death of Sardanapalus and The Execution of Doge Marino Faliero, also painted in the late 1820s. He produced it at the same time as Boissy d\u2019Anglas Leading a Riot (a chiaroscuro scene of revolutionary violence in a huge room) and The Battle of Nancy (similarly inspired by late medieval warfare). == History== Sketch by Delacroix, c.1827. Delacroix spent May to August 1825 in Great Britain, becoming devoted to its literature, especially Scott and William Shakespeare. Murder was just one of several works by the painter to be inspired by Quentin Durward \u2013 two sketches survive of The Ardennes Boar (ink on paper, showing William I de La Marck, 15 x 10.5 cm, c. 1827\u20131829, private collection, Paris) and Quentin Durward and La Balafr\u00e9 (sketch, c.1828\u20131829, mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Caen). Postcard of the Great Hall of the Palais de Justice in Rouen, c.1900 Murder was commissioned by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, the future king Louis-Philippe, who became its owner. Its chiaroscuro setting was inspired by Westminster Hall in London and the Palais de Justice in Rouen. Delacroix' correspondence shows him to have been worried about the work, only completing it once he was sure it would be his \"Austerlitz\" not his Waterloo.Ren\u00e9 Huyghe, Delacroix ou le combat solitaire, Hachette, 1964, . For some time it was exhibited at the gallery of Henri Gaugain, an art dealer and publisher before being put on show at the 1831 Paris Salon.Gustave Planche, Salon de 1831, on gallica.bnf.fr, Paris, Pinard, 1831, p. 114-116. For \u00c9tienne-Jean Del\u00e9cluze, \"this little canvas yells, shouts, blasphemes ... one hears the tipsy soldiers' obscene songs. Such figures of brigands! ... What jovial and bloodthirsty bestiality! It swarms and squeaks just as it blazes and stinks!.\u00c9tienne-Jean Del\u00e9cluze, cited in \u00ab L'Assassinat de l'\u00e9v\u00eaque de Li\u00e8ge \u00bb, on idixa.net (accessed 25 July 2016)\" Th\u00e9ophile Gautier was enthusiastic about the work, stating that \"for the movement and fury of its composition, it is an inimitable masterpiece, a painted whirlwind, everything moving frantically in this little space, emerging from which one seems to hear lamentations and thunder ; never have we seen thrown onto a canvas a crowd more hard, more swarming, more screaming or more enraged [...] This painting is truly tumultuous and loud ; we hear it as much as we see it.Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, \u00ab Exposition du Louvre \u00bb, sur theophilegautier.fr, La Presse, 22 mars 1838 (consult\u00e9 le 25 juillet 2016).}} However, classical art critics savaged the work as too innovative \u2013 \"[The same artist's] The Bridge at Taillebourg was a painting by a savage, and The Murder of the Bishop of Li\u00e8ge is furious debauchery by a barbarian. What is he in himself? A monkey adorned with Titian's meltwater.\"Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix \u00e0 l'Exposition du Boulevard des Italiens, Paris, 1864, p.7. ==References== Category:Paintings by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix Category:1829 paintings category:Paintings of the Louvre by French artists category:Works about murder category:History paintings Category:Cultural depictions of religious leaders Category:Cultural depictions of Belgian men ",
