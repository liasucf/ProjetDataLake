    "text": "Franz Lachner Franz Paul Lachner (2 April 1803 \u2013 20 January 1890) was a German composer and conductor. ==Biography== Lachner was born in Rain am Lech to a musical family (his brothers Ignaz, Theodor and Vinzenz also became musicians). He studied music with Simon Sechter and Maximilian, the Abb\u00e9 Stadler. He conducted at the Theater am K\u00e4rntnertor in Vienna. In 1834, he became Kapellmeister at Mannheim. As a result of composers' aesthetic comparisons of Beethoven's symphonic output with efforts afterwards, in 1835, there was a competition in Vienna for the best new symphony sponsored by Tobias Haslinger of the music publishing firm with no fewer than 57 entries. Lachner received first prize with his 5th Symphony Sinfonia passionata, or Preis-Symphonie and became royal Kapellmeister at Munich, becoming a major figure in its musical life, conducting at the opera and various concerts and festivals. His career there came to a sudden end in 1864 after Richard Wagner's disciple Hans von B\u00fclow took over Lachner's duties. Lachner remained officially in his post on extended leave for a few years until his contract expired. ==Work== See: List of compositions by Franz Lachner Bust of Lachner on his grave at the Alter S\u00fcdfriedhof in Munich Lachner was a well-known and prolific composer in his day, though he is not now considered a major composer. His work, influenced by Ludwig van Beethoven and his friend Franz Schubert, is regarded as competent and craftsman-like, but is now generally little known. Among his greatest successes were his opera Catharina Cornaro (1841, preceding Donizetti's opera by three years), his Requiem, and his seventh orchestral suite (1881). In the present day it may be his organ sonatas (Opp. 175, 176, 177) and chamber music, in particular his music for wind instruments, that receive the most attention, though his string quartets and some of his eight symphonies have been performed and recorded. His songs, some of which are set to the same texts that Schubert used, contributed to the development of the German Lied. For performances of Luigi Cherubini's M\u00e9d\u00e9e in Frankfurt in 1855, Lachner composed recitatives to replace the original spoken dialogue, and it was this version, translated into Italian, which was used in many twentieth-century revivals and recordings of that opera. ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Category:1803 births Category:1890 deaths Category:19th-century classical composers Category:19th-century conductors (music) Category:19th-century German composers Category:19th- century male musicians Category:Composers for harp Category:German classical composers Category:German conductors (music) Category:German male conductors (music) Category:German male classical composers Category:German opera composers Category:German Romantic composers Category:Male opera composers Category:Members of the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art Category:People from Rain, Swabia Category:People from the Kingdom of Bavaria ",
