    "text": "A hurdle model is a class of statistical models where a random variable is modelled using two parts, the first which is the probability of attaining value 0, and the second part models the probability of the non-zero values. The use of hurdle models are often motivated by an excess of zero's in the data, that is not sufficiently accounted for in more standard statistical models. In a hurdle model, a random variable x is modelled as : \\Pr (x = 0) = \\theta : \\Pr (x e 0) = p_{x e 0}(x) where p_{x e 0}(x) is a truncated probability distribution function, truncated at 0. Hurdle models were introduced by John G. Gragg in 1971.John G. Gragg (1971) Some Statistical Models for Limited Dependent Variables with Application to the Demand for Durable Goods Econometrica Vol. 39, No. 5 (Sep., 1971), pp. 829-844 , where the non-zero values of x were modelled using a normal model, and a probit model was used to model the zeros. The probit part of the model was said to model the presence of \"hurdles\" that must be overcome for the values of x to attain non-zero values, hence the designation hurdle model. Hurdle models were later developed for count data, with Poisson, geometricJohn Mullahy (1986) Specification and testing of some modified count data models Journal of Econometrics Vol 33, No. 3 (Dec 1986), pp. 341-365 , and Negative Binomial A.H.

With a mixture model, the probability of the variable being zero is determined by both the main distribution and the mixture weight. Specifically, a zero-inflated model for a random variable x is : \\Pr (x = 0) = \\pi + (1 - \\pi) \\times p(x = 0) : \\Pr (x = h_i) = (1 - \\pi) \\times p(x = h_i) where \\pi is the mixture weight that determines the amount of zero-inflation. A zero-inflated model can only increase the probability of \\Pr (x = 0), but this is not a restriction in hurdle models Yongyi Min & Alan Agresti (2005) Random effect models for repeated measures of zero-inflated count data Statistical Modelling Vol 5, Issue 1, 2005 == See also == * Zero- inflated model * Truncated normal hurdle model ==References== Category:Statistical models ",
