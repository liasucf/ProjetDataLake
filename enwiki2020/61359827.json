Both Milla and Moses meet at the train platform and become friends. Milla\u2019s parents, Henry is a therapist and Anna takes drugs to cope with her daughter\u2019s illness. Milla brings Moses home to meet her parents. Anna admits to being put off by Moses being 23 while Milla is still a teen. Milla takes violin lessons from her tutor Gidon. He helps her practice along with a neighbor boy named Tin Wah. Meanwhile, Henry goes to see the fuss over a barking dog and a pregnant neighbor, Toby. They share a laugh after learning that Toby\u2019s dog is also named Henry. One night, Moses breaks into Milla's house to look for food and other things. Anna catches him and calmly tries to talk him down, but Henry and Milla come in and witness the scene. Milla steps in to diffuse the situation and suggests that Moses stay for breakfast since it\u2019s almost morning. Henry and Anna agree and have breakfast with Moses before Milla gets ready for school by unveiling her new wig, which Moses really likes. Moses visits Milla later. Milla sits by the pool while Moses swims for a little. She asks him to the formal and he accepts, but the moment is ruined when Milla starts to feel like she\u2019s going to vomit. Milla asks Anna for the drugs, but Moses reveals he swiped them. Anna makes him leave, and Milla asks Moses if he only hangs out with her for the drugs and if he is making fun of her. He nods yes to the drugs but shakes his head for the second part. Henry goes to Toby\u2019s house again, and after a chat, he impulsively kisses her. He immediately regrets it even though she didn\u2019t mind it. Henry goes home and sits with regret over it, and although he doesn\u2019t outright say it, Anna seems to understand but forgives him. Henry then invites Moses to stay with them even though he doesn\u2019t like him, just because he wants Milla to be happy. Moses stays with the Finlays and helps with things like making dinner. Things go well with him and Milla, and they even prepare to go to formal together until Milla finds out Henry is signing Moses\u2019s drug prescriptions the same way he is with Anna. Milla rants to her parents and Moses, forcing him to leave because she thinks he doesn\u2019t really care about her. He goes to his old house to see Isaac again, but he is once again driven out by their mother. He returns to Milla\u2019s room and tells her he cares for her a lot and that he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do if she dies. They talk some more and spend the night together. Milla\u2019s parents host a birthday party for her, inviting all the neighbors. After the festivities, Milla and Moses prepare to have sex for the first time. She feels that now is a good time to die, and she asks him to smother her since she cannot take the pain from the sickness any longer. Moses tries but cannot go through with it, and the two have sex. Later that night, Milla wakes up and walks outside to look up at the sky one last time and listen to the birds. In the morning, Moses wakes up next to Milla. Moses doesn\u2019t outright say anything, but Henry appears to already know what happened. Anna walks into Milla\u2019s room to give her breakfast but finds that she is dead. As she comes out ready to yell at Moses, he insists that she was already dead when he woke up. Anna breaks down and Moses holds her, while Henry goes into the bedroom to kiss his daughter one last time. Flashback is shown with Moses and the family at the beach. While Milla is taking Henry\u2019s picture, she asks him to take care of Moses when she is gone, and Henry agrees. ==Cast== * Eliza Scanlen as Milla Finlay * Toby Wallace as Moses * Emily Barclay as Toby * Eugene Gilfedder as Gidon * Essie Davis as Anna Finlay * Ben Mendelsohn as Henry Finlay * Andrea Demetriades as Jenny * Edward Lau as Tin Wah * Zach Grech as Isaac * Georgina Symes as Polly * Michelle Lotters as Scarlett ==Release== Babyteeth had its world premiere at the Venice International Film Festival on 4 September 2019, where it competed for the Golden Lion.
