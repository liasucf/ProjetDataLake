For their audition, they sang I Want It That Way by the Backstreet Boys. While they received positive feedback from judges Piers Morgan and Amanda Holden, Simon Cowell criticized the band for looking 'out-dated' and claimed that they shouldn't have tried to impersonate the band. In retaliation to this, the band performed Ain't No Mountain High Enough to win him over. They received three yes votes from the judges. They then found out they went through to the semi finals. In the second semi final, the band performed No Boundaries by Kris Allen. They received positive feedback from all three judges, and after landing in the judges vote, they were chosen by Cowell and Morgan to go through to the final. In the final, the band performed What About Now by Westlife, originally by Daughtry. While they received positive comments from two of the judges, Cowell was yet again to criticize the song choice as he believed that the song didn't make them 'young enough'. They eventually finished outside the Top 3. After the show, the band performed on the Britain's Got Talent Live Tour, across arenas all over the UK, performing the songs Never Forget by Take That, Everybody in Love by JLS, and Don't Stop Me Now by Queen as part of the finale. ===2010\u201312: Post Talent & Hiatus=== ====Split from Connected==== Connected performed their last gig together in Tamworth in front of 20,000 people on 18 July 2010. On 30 July, Harry, Max and Matt announced on Facebook and their website that they had split with the twins and were forming a new band. The group were scheduled to perform a gig that night. The twins gave their story to the Manchester Evening News, following an article the Mondryks and Fitzgerald had given to the paper a week before. The twins vowed to continue performing as a duo. ====Record deal and debut single==== Myles (left) and Connor (right) performing at the Blackpool illuminations 2011 The twins were performing at a social club when a record label scout approached them and invited them to London to discuss their future.
