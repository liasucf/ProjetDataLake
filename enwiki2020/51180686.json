    "text": "Bartol Sfondrati (1541\u20141583) was 16th century Jesuit missionary who is considered as the first Ragusan Jesuit. Sfondrati became a jesuit in 1569 after graduating law at the University of Pavia. == Early life == Sfondrati's ancestors came from Cremona (modern-day Italy) to Ragusa several generations before Bartol was born.: \"...Bartol Sfondrati, rodom iz Cremone.\" It is assumed that his year of birth is 1541. == Education == Sfondrati became a law student in Pavia in 1566 supported by Ragusan Senate with yearly scholarship of 30 golden scudo.: \"Prvi dubrova\u010dki isusovac bio je Bartol Sfondrati (1541- 1583). S dvadeset i osam godina ulazi u Isusova\u010dki red kao pavijanski pravnik i s dubrova\u010dkom godi\u0161njom naknadom od trideset zlatnih \u0161kuda. Mladog Sfondratija biskupu su opisali kao ...\" \"Sfondrati je u\u010dio prava u Pavii u Italiji g. 1566 i dobijao za to kao pomo\u0107 od dubrova\u010dkog senata godi\u0161nje po 30 zlatnih \u0161kuda\" After completion of the canonic and civil law school at the University of Pavia Sfondrati became a Jesuit on 17 October 1569. After he was a student at college in Rome in period 1570\u201475 he became a priest confessor at Illyrian College of St. Jerome.: \"Le avventure di Bartolomeo Sfondrati Il primo gesuita ragusino fu Bartolomeo Sfondrati (1541-1583), entrato nella Compagnia all'et\u00e0 di ventotto anni a Pavia, dove esercitava la professione di avvocato. Inviato al Collegio Illirico di Loreto, divenne sacerdote confessore.\" == Missionary campaigns == In the period between February 1576 and 1578 Sfondrati was a missionary in Boka Kotorska bay. In period 1580\u201483 Sfondrati was missionary in Belgrade.: \"Oko 1580 \u2014 83. u Beogradu je kao misionar djelovao isusovac Bartol Sfondrati, rodom Dubrov\u010danin.\" In 1580 Sfondrati accompanied Bonifacio de Stefanis (Bonifacije Drakolica) who was appointed as apostolic visitor and delegate to Dalmatia, Herzegovina, Bosnia, Croatia, Vallachia, Slavonia, Serbia and other European territories governed by the Ottomans.: \"Godine 1580. apostolski je vizitator i delegat za Dalmaciju, Hercegovinu, Bosnu, Hrvatsku, Slavoniju, Srbiju, Ugarsku, Vla\u0161ku i druge europske krajeve pod turskom vla\u0161\u0107u, a pratilac mu je dubrova\u010dki isusovac Bartol Sfondrati.\" Together with Sfondrati, the Holy Seat sent another jesuit to accompany de Stefanis. It was Franciscan from Bosnia, Antun de Mattei. Two of them carried two big suitcases to de Stefanis, full of books they were instructed to deliver to priests of both Catholic and Orthodox religion. Sfondrati reported that during his voyage into Ottoman Balkans he met many Christians who converted to Islam to avoid payment of taxes, from which Muslims were exempt.: \"Sfondrati je zapisao kako je velik broj kr\u0161\u0107ana preuzeo tursku vjeru jer su tako izbjegli pla\u0107anje \"dukata po glavi\", \u010dega su kao muslimani bili oslobo\u0111eni.\" Sfondrati stated that there was about 5,000 Catholics at that time in Sarajevo, mostly slaves and traders. He also recorded that many Christians lived in Herzegovina, most of them being Orthodox Serbs.: U Hercegovini je bilo mnogo kr\u0161\u0107ana, \"no ti su ve\u0107inom srpski raskolnici\" (pravoslavni).\" De Stefanis died on this difficult visitation in Timi\u0219oara in 1582. Sfondrati died in poverty and dimwitted, also in Timi\u0219oara, on 17 November 1583. == Literary work == On 12 January 1576 Sfondrati wrote from Dubrovnik to Claudio Aquaviva emphasizing that Ragusan Republic have intention to publish a catechism on Slavic language for its younger population. It is assumed that Sfondrati translated the catechism written by Jacques Ledesma. The publishing of this catechism was ordered by brothers Angel and Ivan Zagurovi\u0107, of Zagurovi\u0107 noble family. They were sons of Jerolim Zagurovi\u0107,MISCELLANEA, vol.

The first edition of his translation was published in 1576 in Venice. The second edition was published in 1578 also in Venice, in the printing house of Zanetti, with the following title: \"Dottrina christiana. Composta per il P. D.
