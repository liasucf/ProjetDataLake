    "text": "NickMusic is an Australian TV channel jointly owned by Foxtel Networks and ViacomCBS. It launched on 1 July 2020 replacing Channel [V] on channel 802, taking the slot of [V]'s 2-hour timeshift. It is an Australian version of the U.S pay television channel of the same name, a kid-safe, family-friendly music video channel for 4-15 year olds mainly featuring current-day pop and teen pop hits on an automated schedule. It is the first NickMusic channel in Oceania and the second to launch outside of the United States (after the Dutch version). On 6 July 2020, NickMusic was made available in New Zealand via satellite TV broadcaster Sky. Unlike its sister MTV-branded music channels, NickMusic is not programmed locally and is instead a direct (non-timeshifted) simulcast of the Dutch version. As a result, many Dutch-language pop music videos are regularly broadcast on the Australian channel. ==References== Category:Foxtel Australia and New Zealand Category:Television channels and stations established in 2020 Category:English-language television stations in Australia Category:Children's television channels in Australia Category:Music video networks in Australia Category:New Zealand television channels Category:2020 establishments in Australia ",
