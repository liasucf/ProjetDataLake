It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Zemun. == Location == Ugrinovci is located in the eastern section of the Syrmia region, in the western part of the municipality of Zemun, near the administrative border of the municipality of Vojvodina. It is located on the Batajnica- Dobanovci road. In the northern direction to Batajnica, which is away, is the new sub-neighborhood of Busije, while in the northern direction to Dobanovci (, over the Belgrade-Zagreb highway) is the also new sub-neighbourhood of Grmovac, both being populated since the mid-1990s with the refugees from Croatia and Bosnia and Hercegovina, which almost doubled the population of Ugrinovci. ==Demographics== Population of Ugrinovci has been steadily growing for the last four decades. Population according to the official censuses of population: * 1948 - 1,769 * 1953 - 1,728 * 1961 - 1,895 * 1971 - 2,258 * 1981 - 3,278 * 1991 - 4,007 * 2002 - 7,199 * 2012 - 10,807 Ethnic structure (2002): Serbs 7,007 (97,33%), Romani 40 (0,55%). == Characteristics == Ugrinovci is statistically classified as a village, since majority of its population is employed in agriculture. Since detachment of the municipality of Sur\u010din from Zemun in 2003, Ugrinovci remained the only separate settlement in the municipality of Zemun, as all the other settlements (Batajnica, Zemun Polje, former city of Zemun, etc.) are part of the Belgrade city proper (u\u017ea teritorija grada). Name of the village comes from the medieval name for Hungarians (Ugri). == See also == * Busije * Grmovac == References == * Jovan \u0110.
