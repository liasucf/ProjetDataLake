    "text": "The Garand carbine was John Garand's entry during the Light Rifle program that produced the M1 Carbine. The weapon was chambered in the .30 Carbine round and was fed from a magazine inserted from the top right side., Garand Carbine at Forgotten Weapons. ==History== The first Springfield light rifle was designed by John Garand for the .30 Carbine competitions (tested 26\u201328 May 1941), which had the top feed magazine. It required offset sights to allow for the top mounted magazine and ejected rounds, which frequently strike the operator's left arm.Larry Ruth, M1 Carbine: Design, Development & Production, Gun Room Press, 1979, , pp. 9, 10. The second Springfield (Garand) Cal .30 Light Rifle (tested 15 Sep 1941), had a more conventional bottom feed magazine placement but was heavier than the first model.Larry Ruth, M1 Carbine: Design, Development & Production, Gun Room Press, 1979, , pp. 26, 27. Neither model went past prototype development. ==References== Category:.30 Carbine firearms Category:Carbines Category:Trial and research firearms of the United States Category:Semi-automatic rifles of the United States ",
