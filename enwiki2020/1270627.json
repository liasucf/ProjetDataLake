Eberg\u00f6tzen has 1,868 inhabitants (December 2005). Eberg\u00f6tzen has achieved some fame as being the place where Wilhelm Busch, author of the Max und Moritz stories that make many consider him the \"Father of the Comic Strip\", spent large parts of his childhood. Wilhelm Busch lived there from 1841 to 1846, staying with his uncle Georg Kleine, the pastor of Eberg\u00f6tzen. He had a friendship with the miller's son and neighbour, Erich Bachmann, and it is speculated that the tricks and experiences of the two boys are portrayed in \"Max and Moritz\". Eberg\u00f6tzen is home to two tourist attractions, the Wilhelm Busch Museum, and the European Bread Museum. ==References== Category:G\u00f6ttingen (district) ",
