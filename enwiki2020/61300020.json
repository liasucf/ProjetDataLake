Its architecture is described as \"derived from the innovative work of Henry Hobson Richardson. The stretching of the roof planes to form the porches, and the lifting of roof planes to form dormers are Richardsonian features as is the sculptured treatment of the shingled second story which has been modulated to create flared surfaces and bow windows.\" With It is also a contributing building in the East Anniston Residential Historic District. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Calhoun County, Alabama Category:Romanesque Revival architecture in Alabama Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1886 Category:1886 establishments in Alabama ",
