    "text": "Open Discourse is a technical term used in discourse analysis and Sociolinguistics and is commonly contrasted with Closed Discourse. The concept of open and closed discourse is associated with the overlay of open and closed discourse communities and open and closed communication events. Keys to determining whether a discourse is open or closed include access to information, equity of access, open access, quality of discourse and mechanisms and modalities of discourse control: overt, covert, implicit and incidental. As a conceptual filter and cultural construct, ideology is a function and mechanism of discourse control. Channel and signal of a communication event and register of communication together control discourse and therefore, determine the degree of social inclusion and social exclusion and, by extension, the relative efficiency of that communication event. Open and closed discourse operate along a continuum where absolute closure and complete openness are theoretically untenable due to noise in the channel. The nature of the channel, signal, code, replicability, recording, transmissibility, cataloguing, recall or other variable of a communication event and its information control and context of transmission-as-event, impact its relative position along the continuum between open and closed discourse. In all cases, open discourse is assumed to be sustained discourse. Van Dijk (c.2003: p. 357) holds that: > \"Although most discourse control is contextual or global, even local details > of meaning, form, or style may be controlled, e.g. the details of an answer > in class or court, or choice of lexical items or jargon in courtrooms, > classrooms or newsrooms (Martin Rojo 1994).Van Dijk, Teun A.

It > is not patented, no one is in charge, and we have no idea whatsoever as to > how much we have invested in it, or even how much it costs us to keep it > running.... The Web \u2013 and in particular the rise of the so-called > blogosphere \u2013 has led to a resurgence of open public discourse that is > unparalleled since the emergence of independent newspapers and pamphleteers > at the outset of the Industrial revolution.

Source: > (accessed: Monday April 12, 2010) ==Open discourse as open-endedness: text and context as living document== Open discourse as living document may also be understood as the open-endedness in both a communication event and the inability to collapse a communication event into definitives, the unequivocal import of a cultural artifact and the associated inability to resolve ambiguity due to noise and ever-changing context and audience, as Graham (2000: p. 5) further states: > ...I understand the play on multiplicity of interpretation and > open\u2010endedness that ambiguity signifies however, the term ambiguous is > itself ambiguous \u2013 it not only means \u201copen to various interpretations\u201d but > also \u201cof doubtful and uncertain nature; difficult to understand\u201d and > \u201clacking clearness or definiteness, obscure\u201d (Macquarie Essential > Dictionary, 1999: 23).Graham, Linda J.(2005). \"Discourse analysis and the > critical use of Foucault.\" Queensland University of Technology.

Journals are beginning to > support web posting of comments on their published articles and independent > organizations are providing centralized web sites for posting comments about > any published article. The trend promises to give one and all access to read > and contribute to cutting edge scientific criticism and debate.\" NB: proper > noun of 'Internet' repaired from the error 'internet'.Dayton, Andrew (2006). > \"Beyond open access: open discourse, the next great equalizer.\" > Retrovirology.

Discourse on Urban Development in Two Cities.\" Urban Studies, Vol. 32, No. 1, pp.49-67. ==Pedagogical discourse== Dawson & Taylor (1998) have documented experiential learnings of the logistics of open and critical discourse in the discourse community of the science classroom.Dawson, Vaille M. & Taylor, Peter C.
