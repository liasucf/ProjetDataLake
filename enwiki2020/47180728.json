The station's concession is held by La Voladora Comunicaci\u00f3n, A.C., and the station is known as La Voladora. XHECA is a member of AMARC M\u00e9xico. ==History== The 1999 UNAM strike sowed the seeds for a number of community radio stations across Mexico, including La Voladora, as well as XHCD-FM in Hermosillo. During the strike, students operated a radio station known as \"La Ke Huelga\". Several people involved with that station, and with other similar projects, banded together to form a new station project known as La Voladora (\"The Flyer\"). Initially conceived as being a moving, 20-watt FM radio station that would visit rural areas. As part of that project, La Voladora set up shop in Amecameca on October 27, 2000, on 102.1 MHz, without a permit to operate. In December 2000, Popocat\u00e9petl, the nearby volcano, recorded its largest eruption in 1,200 years. As a result of the natural emergency, La Voladora opted to remain in Amecameca permanently. Additionally, the station began to fight to obtain a permit, and in May 2005, La Voladora received a permit for XHECA-FM on 97.3 MHz. In August 2017, the Federal Telecommunications Institute approved a relocation of the station's transmitter. ==References== Category:Radio stations in the State of Mexico Category:Community radio stations in Mexico Category:Former pirate radio stations ",
