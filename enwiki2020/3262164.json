It appeared on the ARIA Singles Chart, but was not included on her debut album, Innocent Eyes (March 2003). The Sydney Morning Heralds Guy Blackman described the track as \"an anonymous slice of Britney-esque 'tween-pop'\". Goodrem had been \"discovered and nurtured\" by Glenn Wheatley, and signed with Sony Music Australia. The track was recorded with Vince Pizzinga (Danielle Spencer) producing. In August 2007 Goodrem explained to Andrew Denton on his show Enough Rope with Andrew Denton that the Britney image was foisted on her \"when you start with a record company you don't really know what the whole process is. You don't know how the whole military operation before a song even gets to the radio and for people to even get to hear it\". The single is very rare and has been spotted selling on eBay for $199.99. Despite seldom mentioned as Goodrem's debut single, it did feature during her 2005 Visualise Tour. It was also featured in the \"Edge of Seventeen\" medley, which was included as a B-side to her \"I Can't Break It to My Heart\" single. ===Music video=== Goodrem's video for this song followed a simple theme. It showed an angsty Goodrem escaping from her parents' house to be with her rebellious boyfriend. The boyfriend takes Goodrem on a motorcycle ride into the forest, where he blindfolds her. When Goodrem takes her blindfold off, she is surrounded by a tree full of ribbons, a special surprise that was created by the boyfriend. The video is also intercut with scenes of Goodrem dancing in a Christmas-light-filled backdrop, and a scene where Goodrem is dancing in a wheat field. ===Track listing=== ===Chart performance=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (2001) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Australian Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|64 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2001 singles Category:2000 debut singles Category:Delta Goodrem songs Category:Songs written by Steve Kipner Category:2000 songs Category:Songs written by Pam Sheyne Category:Atlantic Records singles Category:Epic Records singles Category:Songs written by David Frank (musician) ",
