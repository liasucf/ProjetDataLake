    "text": "The Tramp The Tramp is Charlie Chaplin's sixth film for Essanay Studios and was released in 1915. Directed by Chaplin, it was the fifth and last film made at Essanay's Niles, California studio. The Tramp marked the beginning of The Tramp character most known today, even though Chaplin played the character in earlier films. This film marked the first departure from his more slapstick character in the earlier films, with a sad ending and showing he cared for others, rather than just himself. The film co-stars Edna Purviance as the farmer's daughter and Ernest Van Pelt as Edna's father. The outdoor scenes were filmed on location near Niles. ==Plot== In the film, a hobo exchanges The Tramp (Charlie Chaplin)'s sandwich for a brick, so the Tramp must eat grass. The same hobo later bothers a farmer's daughter, and the Tramp comes to her aid with the help of the brick. When two more hobos show up, the Tramp throws all three into a lake. The grateful girl takes the Tramp home, where he fails as a farmhand. He helps defend the farm against criminals, and all seems well, until he discovers the girl of his dreams is already in a relationship. Unwilling to be a problem in their lives, he takes to the road, though he is seen skipping and swinging his cane as if happy to be back on the road where he knows he belongs. ==Cast== The Tramp on the road * Charlie Chaplin as The Tramp * Edna Purviance as Farmer's daughter * Lloyd Bacon as Edna's fianc\u00e9/Second thief * Leo White as First thief * Bud Jamison as Third thief * Ernest Van Pelt as Farmer, Edna's father * Paddy McGuire as Farmhand * Billy Armstrong as Minister ==Reception== Like many American films of the time, The Tramp was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards.
