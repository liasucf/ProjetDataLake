    "text": "The 1909\u201310 Williams Ephs men's ice hockey season was the 7th season of play for the program. ==Season== After the mostly unsuccessful challenge to the IHA the year before, Williams only played one team from the top conference and surprisingly won the match. The Ephs continued to perform well over the course of the season, winning six of their seven games while playing only once at home. At the end of the season William's victory over Princeton could have given them a claim to the intercollegiate championship, however, Princeton played most of their games against top competition while Williams did not. The win also came in the preliminary time of the schedule when most teams weren't fully ready for play and thus was not given the same weight that a game later in the season would receive. In any event, Williams was able to claim a win over the 1910 Intercollegiate hockey champion, something very few small schools could even hope to accomplish. ==Roster== ==Standings== ==Schedule and Results== |- !colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season ==References== Category:Williams Ephs men's ice hockey seasons Williams Ephs Williams Ephs Category:1909 in sports in Massachusetts Category:1910 in sports in Massachusetts ",
