It is believed that the name Deoli came from the Hindi word Devro (\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0930\u094b\u0902), meaning \"Place of Gods\", due to the existence of many temples to Hindu deities. It has a reservoir, \"Nayanabhiram\" or \"Nekchal\" Lake, literally meaning \"good motive lake\". This British-made lake was constructed to fight drought and scarcity of water. The cost of acquiring land, incurred for construction of Camp Deoli, by the British, was Rs. 368 at the time. Although most of the Princely units had accepted the sovereignty of the British, they always remained skeptical about the intentions of the annexed states. In order to overcome this, a regulation was passed, making it mandatory to keep a conservator from the annexed princely under the control of a British agent. This agent was referred to as Rokadia; although they had all the facilities they were, in a way, under the detention of the British Government. The present Senior Secondary School building was the bungalow of the then political agent, which had a swimming pool. Similarly, the famous Nevar Bagh (\u0928\u0947\u0935\u0930 \u092c\u093e\u0917) was also developed by the English agent. A swimming pool was also built here which has now been dumped. Today's CISF set-up was originally a prison. German and Italian civilians were interned here after the British declaration of war in 1939. Later prisoners of the Indian freedom struggle were kept here. The church was established here during the British period. It is said to be about a hundred years old. There is a medieval pilgrimage center around the Deoli, which includes Borda Ganesh, Kunchalvada- Mata, Chandali Mata, Gokarneshwar Mahadev, Ravata Hanuman ji, Gadoli Mahadev, Lakdeshwar Mahadev, Hindeshwar Mahadev etc. Amongst these, there is a story associated with Hindeshwar Mahadev of Hindoli that, during exile, the Pandavas built this Shiva Lingam with only five fistfuls of clay (\u092a\u093e\u0901\u091a \u092e\u0941\u091f\u0943\u0920\u0940 (\u0927\u094b\u092c\u0947)). There is also a folklore that ten-headed Ravana performed Shiva Worshipping in nearby Bisalpur at Gokarneshwar Mahadev Temple. ===Places=== It has a CISF training center.
