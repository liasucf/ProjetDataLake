He became interested in drawing from early childhood and at age of nine, an aunt showed him an interview with Mike Deodato in the local newspaper, what caused him great impact because Deodato also lived in Para\u00edba and drew for the great American publishers. Jack explains, \"And that's when I discovered that I could live with comics, work with comics. So it was from there that I came to believe.\". At age 10, his family moved to Jo\u00e3o Pessoa where he lives until now. In the 90's, he was first influenced by superheroes when he discovered Jim Lee's X-Men and the TV serie X-Men: Animated Series.

The series was an immediate hit, becoming Dynamite's best-selling title and firmly returning Red Sonja to mainstream popularity. The character now has a monthly series, together with a series of mini-series and one-shots, all published by Dynamite Entertainment. The main Red Sonja series features a number of cover artists as well as the regular team of writer Michael Avon Oeming and artist Mel Rubi.

Alex was looking for an artist to work with him on Kirby Genesis Project and had already done some testing, but he liked Jack's art so much that invited him for pencils and inks. Kirby Genesis is a series with 9 hardcover books based on the concepts and characters of the great Jack Kirby and was published during 2011 and 2012. The project had the script done by Kurt Busiek, arts by Alex Ross and Jack Herbert and colors by Vin\u00edcius Andrade.
