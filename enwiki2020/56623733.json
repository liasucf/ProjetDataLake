    "text": "Major John Aldridge (4 January 1832 \u2013 23 February 1888) was a British Conservative Party politician. ==Family== Aldridge was the son of Robert Aldridge and Caroline Anne, daughter of Charles George Beauclerk. He married in 1863 to Mary Alethea, daughter of Samuel Matthews, and together they had five children: * Emily Marian (1864\u20131897) * Robert Beauclerk (1865\u20131892) * Charles Powlett (1866\u20131941) * Herbert Henry (1869\u20131922) * John Barttelot (1871\u20131909) ==Political career== He was elected MP for Horsham in 1868 alongside Robert Henry Hurst. This was unusual as the seat was only eligible to send one member. Although both candidates were declared elected, petitions were lodged against them both, and on 3 May 1869 Aldridge withdrew his claim to entitlement to the seat, leaving Hurst as the sole MP. ==St Leonard's House== Aldridge inherited the St Leonard's Forest estate, near Horsham, from his father, Robert Aldridge, in 1871. After 1878, he selling land from the estate, perhaps due to the agricultural recession. Upon his death in 1888, the estate passed to his son, Robert Beauclerk Aldridge. ==Other activities== Aldridge was at some point a major in the Royal Scots Fusiliers, and then a Colonel commanding the 3rd and 4th battalions of Royal Sussex Regiment. He was also a Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant of Sussex. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Sussex Category:UK MPs 1868\u20131874 Category:1832 births Category:1888 deaths ",
