It is intended as an illustration of the various concepts of that exist in judo, and is used both as a training method and as a demonstration of understanding. ==History== The nage-no-kata was developed by Jigoro Kano as a method of illustrating principles of throwing to allow students to more effectively apply them in randori. Initially the kata consisted of ten techniques. These were subsequently appended with the addition of a further five throws, including kata guruma and uki otoshi. ==Description== The kata is composed of 3 techniques each from the five classifications of throw in judo: * * * * * Each of these 15 techniques is performed twice in the specified order, both right and left handed. The kata is generally performed in a strictly formalised manner with clearly defined . ====== and approach the mat from opposite sides, with Tori on the left hand of the and Uke on the right (i.e. as they would be if facing towards the Joseki). They bow as they step on the mat, then turn to face the Joseki and execute a , then turn to face each other and execute a . Tori and Uke step in, left foot first, to adopt . ====== *55px Tori approaches Uke using . Tori and Uke grip using a standard right-handed sleeve-lapel grip. Uke initiates by stepping forward using into . Tori responds by stepping backwards (tsugi ashi). Uke's balance is compromised and he attempts to regain the advantage by stepping forward again and Tori again responds by stepping backwards, further unbalancing Uke. On Uke's second attempt to regain his balance (i.e. his third step forward), Tori breaks rhythm, dropping to his left knee, and throws Uke to his rear, pulling with a steering motion. Tori and Uke return to their feet and repeat the technique in the opposite (i.e. left-handed) orientation. * 55pxSeoi nage - shoulder throw Uke approaches tori, steps forward with the right foot and raises the right hand as a hammer fist to strike directly on the top of tori's head. This works better if uke uses some power and momentum to strike. Tori allows the blow to begin to fall. Tori steps around 180 degrees, grabs (pulls) uke's right arm to continue to allow uke's momentum to follow forward (Tori does not deflect the blow!). The forward momentum of uke's blow makes uke fall onto tori's back (kuzushi). At the same time tori is ready to receive uke on his back and turns his shoulders and body while maintaining grip of the arm, redirecting the forward energy of the fall (and of uke) to the ground. Tori and Uke return to their feet and repeat the technique in the opposite left-handed orientation. * 55pxKata guruma - shoulder wheel ===Koshi-waza (hip techniques)=== *55pxUki goshi - floating half-hip throw *55pxHarai goshi - sweeping hip throw *55pxTsurikomi goshi - lifting/pulling hip throw ===Ashi-waza (foot techniques)=== *55pxOkuriashi harai - sliding foot sweep *55pxSasae tsurikomi ashi - Propping and drawing ankle throw *55pxUchi mata - inner thigh throw ===Ma-sutemi-waza (rear sacrifice techniques)=== *55pxTomoe nage - circle throw *55pxUra nage - rear throw *55pxSumi gaeshi - corner reversal ===Yoko-sutemi-waza (side sacrifice techniques)=== *55pxYoko gake - side hook *55pxYoko guruma - side wheel *55pxUki waza - floating technique ==References== == External links == * Judo Information Site.
