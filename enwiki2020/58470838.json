It is thought to believe the wakin gave rise to fancy twin-tailed goldfish, including the ryukin, ranchu, oranda, fantail pearlscale, and many more twin- tailed goldfish. It is also the second oldest variety, developed from the common goldfish. ==In Japan== The wakin has many popular cultures and beliefs in the history of Japanese goldfish.{{clarify|date=August 2019} The wakin goldfish, in Japanese terms, are any 'Huna' bodied goldfish with a single tail (in reference to the popular common goldfish), double tail, or triple tail, while in US, a wakin is simply a double tail goldfish with a long body. They are also seen in red and white, which are prized for competition. Other colors have been made from it, such as chocolate, blue, red, white, orange, and yellow. There is also a calico wakin, but for some reason, the regards to its color process, the calico wakin is not a full-blooded wakin line. ==Breeding== Despite the fish's double tail, breeding is easy as long as young fish are cared for properly. ==Other types== The watonai goldfish is a cross between the wakin and the ryukin. ==See also== * List of goldfish varieties ==References== Category:Goldfish breeds ",
