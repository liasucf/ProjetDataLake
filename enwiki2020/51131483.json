    "text": "The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is a state-owned bank that was established in 2015, and in the wake of the Irish banking crisis of the late 2000s, to provide finance for small and medium sized businesses. At the time it was set up, many of Ireland's main banks were unable or unwilling to provide to businesses. The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland does not provide loans directly to businesses themselves, but instead provides finance to the main banks at low cost, with the idea that the money is then loaned on to business. As of 2016, the bank had provided \u20ac347m small business. Its chief executive is Nick Ashmore. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Government agencies of the Republic of Ireland Category:Government- owned companies of the Republic of Ireland Category:Banks established in 2015 Category:2015 establishments in Ireland Category:Banks of Ireland Category:Financial services in the Republic of Ireland Category:Economic history of Ireland Category:Post-2008 Irish economic downturn ",
