    "text": "Tesla, Inc. has faced dealership disputes in several U.S. states as a result of local laws. In the United States, direct manufacturer auto sales are prohibited in many states by franchise laws requiring that new cars be sold only by independent dealers. The electric car manufacturer Tesla maintains that to properly explain to their customers the advantages their cars have over traditional vehicles with an internal combustion engine, they cannot rely on third-party dealerships to handle their sales. == Corporate strategy == Tesla has a 60% degree of vertical integration in 2016 according to Goldman Sachs. The integration includes its own sales channels and proprietary charging infrastructure, among others. The high degree is rare in the automotive industry, where companies typically focus on engine manufacturing and vehicle assembly, outsourcing 80% of components to suppliers while letting franchises serve as sales points. Some of Tesla's stated goals are to increase the number and variety of electric vehicles (EVs) available to mainstream consumers by selling its own vehicles in company-owned showrooms and online. Tesla states that owning stores \"creates an information loop from our customers straight into manufacturing and vehicle design\". Tesla attempts to not make a profit on servicing cars. ===Sales model=== , Tesla operates more than 130 stores and galleries in the United States, and has stores and galleries in 34 other countries. It owns the stores and sells directly to customers via the internet and in non-US stores.Number of Tesla StoresList Tesla has a low budget for marketing, and uses a referral program and word of mouth to attract buyers. ==US dealerships and automotive dealership disputes== Tesla gallery in Austin, Texas. , there are stores and galleries\u2014usually located in shopping malls\u2014in 29 US states and Washington DC. Customers can buy vehicles from stores, as well as from the Tesla website. The stores serve as showrooms that allow people to learn about the company and its vehicles. Some galleries are located in states with restrictive dealership protection laws which prevent discussing price, financing, and test drives, as well as other restrictions. Tesla has set up mobile-shipping-container \"stores\" and 6 Airstream travel trailers each pulled by a Model X, reaching areas not served by brick-and-mortar shops. Tesla's strategy of direct customer sales and owning stores and service centers is different from the standard dealership model in the US vehicle marketplace. Tesla is the only manufacturer that currently sells cars directly to customers; all other automakers use independently owned dealerships although some automakers provide online configuration and financing. 48 states have laws that limit or ban manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to consumers, and although Tesla has no independent dealerships, dealership associations in multiple states have filed numerous lawsuits against Tesla, to prevent the company from selling cars. North Carolina and New Hampshire sided with Tesla, while Virginia and Texas sided with dealers. Jurisdictions outside the United States do not have such laws protecting car dealerships. The laws against direct sales arose historically in the United States starting in the 1930s, as automobile manufacturers started using independently franchised dealerships to offload the tasks of retail selling and servicing vehicles. The laws have been actively defended into the 21st century and extended to online in-state sales. Such regulations protect dealerships against a manufacturer opening its own dealerships and competing against resellers, which could be seen as an abuse of the manufacturer-franchise relationship. Critics view the laws as thwarting legitimate competitive pressure that benefits consumers, and some have described them as \"protectionism\", and \"crony capitalism\".Crane, Daniel A. \"Tesla, Dealer Franchise Laws, and the Politics of Crony Capitalism\" page 577-579. Iowa L. Rev. 101, no. 2 (2016): 573-607 . Size: 35 pages in 1 MegaByte The Federal Trade Commission recommends allowing direct manufacturer sales, which a 2000 report by a Goldman Sachs analyst projected would save consumers an average of $2,225 on a $26,000 car.\"Economic Effects of State Bans on Direct Manufacturer Sales to Car Buyers\" Economic Analysis Group Competition Advocacy, May 2009. In May 2014, a report prepared by Maryann Keller and Kenneth Elias for the National Automobile Dealers Association claims that franchises (such as offered by its members) offer better value for customers than direct sales.http://www.phoenix-center.org/pcpp/PCPP48Final.pdf Independent dealerships typically earn more money from service than from sales, so the lower maintenance requirements of electric vehicles can provide a financial incentive for selling gas-powered vehicles, to Tesla's disadvantage. Investigations by Consumer Reports and the Sierra Club found that independent dealers often could not answer questions about electric cars, did not provide information about government rebates, did not showcase the cars prominently, or let the batteries run out. ==States with total direct sales bans== ===New Mexico (also bans service centers)=== 2006 New Mexico Statutes, Section 57-16-5-V prohibits manufacturers like Tesla to be licensed as a dealer, directly or indirectly performing warranty or other services. Despite Tesla owners' pleas to change the law, they still currently depend on out-of-state centers such as Arizona and Colorado for Tesla sales and services. In January 2019, the Public Affairs Committee approved the Tesla- friendly Senate Bill 243, but it died on the Senate Corporations and Transportation Committee calendar. House Bill 294 died in the House Commerce and Economic Development Committee.CVNM\u2019s 2019 Legislative Outcomes ===Alabama (also bans service centers)=== Alabama regards manufacturer-owned new motor vehicle stores and service centers as \"unfair and deceptive trade practices\". In August 2016 State Senator Tom Whatley introduced Senate Bill 22, assigned to the Senate Tourism and Marketing Committee, which would allow a manufacturer of alternative fuel vehicles to sell and lease its vehicles directly to the public. The bill died in committee.Alabama Senate Bill 22, 2016, 1st Special Session ===South Carolina (also bans service centers)=== South Carolina bans manufacturer ownership of new car dealerships and manufacturer service/repair of cars they do not own. A bill was introduced in 2019 to allow electric only manufacturers to sell in the state.A Bill To Amend Section 56-15-45(D) Of The 1976 Code, Relating To The Prohibition On Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Or Franchisors Selling Motor Vehicles To Consumers In This State, To Provide That An Electric Vehicle Manufacturer May Sell, Directly Or Indirectly, All-Electric Motor Vehicles That It Manufactures To Consumers In This State, And To Define Necessary Terms. However, Tesla does offer mobile service in the state. ===Louisiana === Louisiana enacted a law in June 2017 that bans direct to consumer sales of vehicles.Tesla says new law will prohibit direct sales in Louisiana, June 6, 2017, The Associated Press A service center is planned in New Orleans.https://developinglafayette.com/wp/louisianas-first-tesla-service- delivery-center-coming-soon-to-new-orleans/ ===Texas=== Texas law states \"Except as provided by this section, a manufacturer or distributor may not directly or indirectly:(1) own an interest in a franchised or nonfranchised dealer or dealership;(2) operate or control a franchised or nonfranchised dealer or dealership; or(3) act in the capacity of a franchised or nonfranchised dealer. (Tex. Occ. Code Ann. \u00a7 2301.476) and \"A motor vehicle shall not be advertised for sale in any manner that creates the impression that it is being offered for sale by the manufacturer or distributor of the vehicle. An advertisement shall not contain terms such as \u201cfactory sale,\u201d \u201cfleet prices,\u201d \u201cwholesale prices,\u201d \u201cfactory approved,\u201d \u201cfactory sponsored,\u201d \u201cmanufacturer sale,\u201d use a manufacturer's name or abbreviation in any manner calculated or likely to create an impression that the vehicle is being offered for sale by the manufacturer or distributor, or use any other similar terms which indicate sales other than retail sales from the dealer\" (43 Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7 215.261). These laws make it illegal to buy a car from Tesla in person, at a Tesla Gallery. Thus, all Texas orders are taken via the internet or over the phone. Texas residents can still easily buy a car from Tesla, but the purchase is handled as an out-of-state transaction and must be completed before the vehicle ships to Texas. Tesla recently added the ability to include tax, title, license, and registration in the sale price of the car so the purchaser doesn't have to pay that separately once they receive the vehicle. In 2015, Tesla lobbied the Texas Legislature to modify the law to allow Tesla to sell directly to consumers, and specifically allow Tesla employees to discuss \"financing, leasing, or purchasing options\" at the firm's existing galleries in Austin, Dallas, and Houston. Texas considered legislation in 2015 to allow Tesla to operate in the state but legislation was not passed. , most of the GOP delegates support direct sales while Governor Abbott prefers the current system. According to Texans for Public Justice, Tesla spent $1.3m on lobbyists while dealerships spent $1m. ===Connecticut=== Connecticut does not allow manufacturer direct sales, but does allow direct leasing. Tesla operated a gallery in Greenwich that the Connecticut Automotive Retailers Association successfully got shut down via a lawsuit. In March 2018, Tesla was appealing a ruling that they operate the Greenwich gallery as an unlicensed dealership,TESLA, INC. v. CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES Et Al but later dropped the appeal. The gallery was shut down in March 2019.Tesla shutters Greenwich showroom In December 2019, Tesla started offering leases at their showrooms which allowed them to provide test drives for customers discussing leases.https://www.engadget.com/2019/12/18/tesla-can-lease-cars-in- connecticut/ In 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 bills were introduced in the legislature to allow licensing electric vehicle manufacturers as dealers.After Four Years Of Trying, Tesla Hopes To Win Approval To Sell Cars In Connecticut, 10 Feb 2018https://www.cga.ct.gov/2018/TS/h/2018HB-05310-R00TRA-CV9-TS.htm ===West Virginia=== West Virginia does not allow Tesla-owned stores or showrooms.

Upon learning of Tesla's attempt to obtain a second dealership in the state, the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association filed a lawsuit in March 2016 against both Tesla and the DMV to prevent the licensing of the second dealership. In September 2016, the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (VDMV) recommended ending Tesla direct sales, as at least 11 dealerships were interested in selling Tesla vehicles. The VDMV later allowed Tesla to open another shop (Richmond), as Tesla has no dealerships to compete against; the 11 interested dealerships would not be able to compete on undiscounted prices, as Tesla has the same price online and in shops.Formal Evidentiary Hearing: Tesla Motors, Inc., File No. 2016-001 - Request for a Hearing Pursuant to Va. Code\u00a7\u00a7 46.2-1572(4) and 46.2-1573 to be a Dealer Archive Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, November 30, 2016.

This amendment was dropped a day later.Fight between Tesla, Ohio auto dealers to continue as legislators drop amendment, The Columbus Dispatch A group of auto dealers then sued the state to try to get Tesla's license rescinded. This suit was dismissed less than two months later.

The Ohio Senate approved the bill in April. ===New Jersey (4 store limit)=== On March 10, 2014, it was announced that New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission and Governor Chris Christie's administration would be holding a meeting to pass a new proposal into law. This new proposal, PRN 2013-138, was announced one day before it was to be put into law. Tesla responded by saying that the proposal \"seeks to impose stringent licensing rules that would, among other things, require all new motor vehicles to be sold through middlemen and block Tesla's direct sales model\", and that \"[Governor Christie's] Administration has decided to go outside the legislative process by expediting a rule proposal that would completely change the law in New Jersey.\" The law was passed, and \"Tesla will no longer [be able to] sell electric cars in New Jersey, effective April 1\". Diarmuid O'Connell, Tesla Vice President of Business Development, said, \"Worse, it has done so without any reasonable notice or even a public hearing.\" Forbes contributor Mark Rogosky said, \"The state's new rules protect its auto dealers from having to compete with Tesla's direct sales model\"; he points out that this is a direct contrast from what Christie said earlier, \"We are for a free-market society that allows your effort and ingenuity to determine your success, not the cold, hard hand of the government.\" Kevin Roberts, a spokesman for the Christie administration, responded by saying \"it was the [Tesla Motors] company, not the governor's office, that was attempting to bypass normal procedures.\". In March 2015, a new state law was signed allowing zero-emission vehicle manufacturers to sell at up to four locations and requiring a minimum of one service center. 2018 session Senate bill No. 3493 was introduced to increase the number of allowed sales locations to 14 by 2023, but increases the mandated retail service facilities to seven.https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2018/Bills/S3500/3493_I1.HTM It died in committee.

Most shoppers found it to be a positive experience, although 35 dealerships recommended petrol cars instead, and 13 discouraged EVs. The most knowledgeable dealerships were Chevrolet, and the least were Toyota. In 2016, two shopper surveys showed contrasting shopping experiences between Tesla and traditional dealerships. One performed by the environmental organization Sierra Club found that in 14% of traditional dealerships, their electric cars were not charged to test drive, and 33% did not discuss the $7,500 Federal tax credits. Another study by industry analyst Pied Piper using mystery shoppers found that Tesla sales stores (not galleries) differed among each other on sales techniques, and many stores were reluctant to engage in closing a sale. Customers generally view car shopping as a challenging experience. In May 2019, Sierra Club revisited dealerships, and found that 74% did not offer electric vehicles. Those that did, were mostly in states with requirements for zero-emission vehicles. A 2019 study indicates that only 10% of Americans have significant knowledge of EVs. == References == == External links == * Tesla Direct Sales Map (US) and collection of state laws at Tesla Motors Club forum dealership disputes Category:Auto dealerships of the United States Category:Business rivalries Category:Politics of the United States ",
