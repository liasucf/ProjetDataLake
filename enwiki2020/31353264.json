WMOV's studios are located on Norfolk Square, while its transmitter is located in Chesapeake. ==History== WMOV-FM signed on in May 1990 under the ownership of J.H. Communications as WXRI-FM; taking the call letters of the former station on the 105.3 frequency that had been owned by televangelist Pat Robertson until its sale in May 1989. The station continued with the Contemporary Christian music format of the previous station until its parent company entered an agreement in May 1992 to simulcast the music of WBSK; an urban dance-formatted station that was co-owned by the owners of WOWI. In May 1993, WBSK-FM changed call letters to WSVY, and shifted to an urban AC format.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC- YB/1994/B-Radio-NE-Ter-BC-YB-1994-B&W.pdf; In July 1997, WSVY began simulcasting with 92.1 FM as \"Vibe 107.7 and 92.1.\"HighBeam By March 1999, WSVY shifted to the then-popular Jammin' Oldies format, which would evolve back to Urban AC.
