Among its pupils were the statesman Bonar Law, the philosopher John Henry Muirhead and the sons of David Livingstone. ==Foundation and character== John Adams, founder of Gilbertfield House School.Gilbertfield was established in 1863 at the private initiative of John Adams \u201cto supply a want hitherto felt in Hamilton and its neighbourhood\u201dHamilton Advertiser, 25 June 1864. and occupied premises which he had recently bought and enlarged on High Patrick Street. He conducted this fee-paying establishment in tandem with his headmastership of St John\u2019s Grammar School, a Free Church foundation in Hamilton with over 400 pupils. Many of his private students had previously attended St John\u2019s and proceeded to Gilbertfield for higher education, but he also attracted (and offered boarding for) boys from families based further afield including continental Europe, India and the Caribbean.Hamilton Advertiser, 23 July and 27 August 1864, 27 October 1867. Pupils were generally between the ages of 12 and 15 years. Their number was never large: in the 1872-3 session the total was 54.Hamilton Advertiser, 7 June 1873. The school was advertised as an \u201cEnglish and Classical School\u201d and an \u201cEstablishment for the Board and Education of Young Gentlemen\u201d where \u201cpupils are prepared for the Universities, the Civil Service Examinations, and Commercial Pursuits\u201d.Hamilton Advertiser, 25 June 1864, 24 June 1865, 4 June 1870 and 1 June 1872. From the outset it had English, Classics, Modern Languages (\u201cFrench and German read and spoken daily\u201d), Mathematics, and Writing Departments, taught painting and drawing, and provided instruction in dancing, deportment, gymnastics and fencing.Hamilton Advertiser, 27 August 1864. Scripture, History, Geography and Elocution were taught within the English Department; Modern Languages included Italian and, later, Spanish; Mathematics included Arithmetic, Algebra and Euclid (Geometry); drawing included architectural and industrial drawing and mapping. Drill, under ex-army instructors, was an important element of the school regime.On prize-days, all school classes were drilled on the front-lawn of Gilbertfield House and reviewed by officers of the Lanarkshire Rifles. On the first such occasion, the prize for drill exercises was awarded to William H. H. Williamson who was later ordained and served as Rector of Montego Bay (1881-85) and Vicar of Holy Trinity, Ipswich (1886-1919), where his portrait is a feature of the church\u2019s stained glass (Hamilton Advertiser, 25 June 1864, 15 April 1871). Some of the school\u2019s masters were resident, and others visited regularly; most were graduates or held institutional qualifications. John Adams himself was an Edinburgh University prizeman who had been on the teaching staff at Moray House. He kept abreast of best practice in education, regularly visiting the leading teaching colleges and major public schools in England and Scotland.Hamilton Advertiser, 21 January 1905. He was a first cousin of the missionary-educationalist John Fordyce, whose two sonsThe elder son, Boston Elphinstone Fordyce, graduated in Medicine at Edinburgh and practised in Cambridge; a member of the British Medical Association\u2019s Council, 1912-14, he was a City Councillor and County Alderman. were pupils at Gilbertfield at the same time as Adams\u2019 elder boy.This was Esslemont Adams, aged only 7 when he began attending the school (Hamilton Advertiser, 31 May 1873). He was later Minister of the West Free Church, Aberdeen, and, while serving as a chaplain with the Gordon Highlanders, conducted the joint-service between the British and German trenches on Christmas Day 1914. https://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/ww1-biography/?id=515 ==History== A photograph of pupils at Gilbertfield House School, 1873. Bonar Law appears in the middle row, second from left.Early examination success for the school came when its pupils John Mackintosh and John Wallace Kidston were placed high in the Edinburgh University Local Examinations of 1865.The Scotsman, 15 August 1865; Inverness Courier, 24 August 1865. Mackintosh (otherwise McIntosh) distinguished himself at Glasgow University before dying from diphtheria, aged 20, while serving as a Red Cross volunteer during the Franco-Prussian War: Hamilton Advertiser, 26 November 1870. J. W. Kidston (1851-1926) graduated in law from Oxford, was called to the English Bar in 1878, and was subsequently ordained. Kidston and his brother William Hamilton Kidston were cousins of Bonar Law, and the quality of education they received at Gilbertfield resulted in Bonar Law being placed there in 1871.Robert Blake, The Unknown Prime Minister: The Life and Times of Andrew Bonar Law, 1858-1923 (Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1955). He won prizes for Greek and English in 1873,Hamilton Advertiser, 31 May 1873. and Adams recorded him as being \u201ca boy of great mental power\u201d.Pall Mall Gazette, 26 January 1922; Hamilton Herald and Lanarkshire Weekly News, 8 January 1904. Law\u2019s fellow prizeman in Greek in 1873 was William Lewis Robertson, who served as General Secretary of the Presbyterian Church in England, 1918\u201330, and was its Moderator in 1931. Among other siblings who attended Gilbertfield were John Henry Muirhead and his three gifted brothersviz: James Muirhead (http://www.glasgowwestaddress.co.uk/1909_Glasgow_Men/Muirhead_James.htm), Islay Burns Muirhead, MD, and Rev. Lewis Andrew Muirhead, DD. John Muirhead\u2019s recollection of their days at Gilbertfield appears in his Reflections by a Journeyman in Philosophy (ed. John W. Harvey, George Allen & Unwin, 1942). and David Livingstone\u2019s sons Thomas, who captained the school\u2019s cricket eleven, and Oswell, who won numerous academic prizes.Hamilton Advertiser, 24 June 1865. In the 1864-5 Session, within the Second Class (Highest Division), Oswell Livingstone was Dux in Bible Knowledge, Geography, History and Composition, 1st in Latin Exercises and 2nd in Map Drawing. Livingstone himself was present at the school\u2019s 1865 prize-giving when he addressed the pupils, telling them to \u201cFear God, and Work Hard\u201d. This was his last public speech in Scotland,W. G. Blaikie, Personal Life of David Livingstone (John Murray, 1880), p. 356. https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.51103/page/n377 credited by Frederick Stanley Arnot as the inspiration for his own missionary work in Africa.F. S. Arnot, Journal from Natal to ... the Zambesi in Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society and Monthly Record of Geography, Vol. 11, No. 2 (February 1889) at p. 69, and see Robert I. Rotberg\u2019s \"New Introduction to Arnot\u2019s Garenganze or Seven Years Pioneer Mission Work in Central Africa\" in Cass Library of African Studies, Missionary Researches and Travels, No. 10 (Frank Cass & Co. Ltd, 1969). In Ernest Baker\u2019s The Life and Explorations of Frederick Stanley Arnot (New York, E. P. Dutton & Co.), pp. 18-19, it is stated that Arnot was a pupil at Gilbertfield, but this seems unsupported. By the early 1870s, particular emphasis was given at Gilbertfield to the teaching of Classics and arrangements were in hand for awarding annual Classics scholarships at examinations to be overseen by Glasgow University professors. In 1872 it was reported that \u201cowing to the school\u2019s increasing prosperity, large additions have been made to the schoolrooms, which are now more than ever admirable in their internal arrangements, perfect in ventilation\u201d.Hamilton Advertiser, 1 June 1872. But in 1874, against the background of the Hamilton School Board proposing to make Hamilton Academy the \u201cHigher Class School\u201d of the Burgh under the 1872 Education Act, Adams elected to withdraw from his role at Gilbertfield and transferred the conduct of the school to William Wood, formerly of Dollar Academy.Hamilton Advertiser, 6 September 1873; Glasgow Herald, 5 July 1875. Adams continued as Rector of St.John\u2019s Grammar School until his retirement in 1899, aged 74. Wood ran the school from the Gilbertfield House premises for four years.Glasgow Herald, 7 July 1877; The Scotsman, 17 January 1879. ==Closure== In 1878 Wood removed the school to premises in Douglas Street, Hamilton, where he was joined by D. G. Kinmond, also formerly of Dollar Academy, and as joint-headmasters they styled this new establishment \u201cClydesdale College (formerly Gilbertfield House School)\u201d.Alloa Advertiser, 28 September 1878; Glasgow Herald, 27 September 1878. In the following year Wood left Hamilton to keep a School for Young Ladies in London, and by 1887 Clydesdale College had closed and Kinmond was teaching at Circus Place School in Edinburgh.Islington Gazette, 13 October 1879; The Scotsman, 29 September 1887. ==Notable alumni== *Rev.
