    "text": "Dream Island is an island lying south-east of Cape Monaco, off the south-west coast of Anvers Island in Wylie Bay, in the Palmer Archipelago of Antarctica. It was surveyed by the British Naval Hydrographic Survey Unit in 1956-1957 and named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee for its natural features including a cave and, in summer, a small waterfall, with mossy patches and grass. It lies about 10 km north-west of the United States' Palmer Station. ==Important Bird Area== The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a breeding colony of about 11,000 pairs of Ad\u00e9lie penguins, as well as smaller numbers of chinstrap penguins. The site is protected as a Restricted Area under ASMA 7 - Southwest Anvers Island and Palmer Basin. ==See also== * List of Antarctic islands south of 60\u00b0 S ==References== Category:Islands of the Palmer Archipelago Category:Antarctic Specially Managed Areas Category:Important Bird Areas of Antarctica Category:Seabird colonies ",
