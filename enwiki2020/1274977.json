At the end of the book, the women return to express that they hope the dog and baby weren't bored after having been left alone too long. ==Reception== Publishers Weekly states 'Move over, Mary Poppins, and make room for Carl, the ravishing rottweiler babysitter who makes his fourth and perhaps finest appearance yet in this gorgeously colored picture book.', while Kirkus finds that 'The dogs are as charmingly true to life as ever, while the fantasy will beguile fans and worry a few literal-minded caregivers.' == See also == *Good Dog, Carl ==References== Category:1991 children's books Category:American picture books Category:Fictional dogs ",
