Staff members Rolo, Stacy, and Kelly sneak into the jungle to have sex. They are ambushed by a masked figure, who stabs Rolo to death. The killer chases the girls through the jungle. The killer pushes Kelly off a cliff and decapitates Stacy before she can reach help. The resort staff remain unaware of the killings until Carlos' body is found behind the kitchen. Dave relates a story about a former employee named Phil Colletti who lost his mind and murdered his fellow staff members, before castrating himself and running away; though Pete insists it is a story made up to scare guests around the campfire, the mounting death toll suggests otherwise. Putman alerts the others when he finds Cliff murdered in a hedge maze. A message left by the killer suggests that he is targeting only the staff. All communication devices and transportation have been stolen or destroyed. Hank, a former FBI serial killing investigator, convinces the staff to continue with their jobs and allow him to catch the killer. Yu remains intent on warning the guests, despite warnings not to do so from the killer. When she lures the guests to the beach to make the announcement, she is attacked by the killer. Hank intervenes, but the killer slashes his throat and turns on Yu. Their bodies are found the next day. The staff begins to suspect one of the guests, Penelope. Juan, believing her innocent, tries to eliminate her as a suspect. Putman disappears into the jungle after having a nightmare. Sam and Dave find a shrine of photos of Lars and his friends, in which all of the faces except Lars' have been replaced with Pete's; suspicion turns on Lars and the staff lock Lars in the resort's Drunk Tank. The killer attempts to Kill Jenny by dropping a Television into the swimming pool, but Jenny escapes just in time, ultimately killing Dirk, one of the guests, who at the time, was attempting to make a lecherous pass at Jenny, while also completely oblivious to the situation, despite Jenny's futile attempts to warn him, and causing a power failure. Putman returns, and he and Jenny deduce that Lars is not the killer, and return to the drunk tank to release him, only to find that he has mysteriously escaped. When Pete is found dead as the result of Juan accidentally discovering it, whilst being goaded into revealing a secret, the staff members turn on each other, following an argument about Juan being incarcerated for raping a goat, as well as Dave's Parents being trampled to death years ago at a Coconut Pete concert. Partway through the argument, Lars returns and discovers Pete's body. Lars briefly grieves, before proceeding to lunge at Sam for locking him in the drunk tank in the first place. Just as everything escalates rapidly, Jenny calms everyone else down and tries to convince the group that they must work together to survive until the shuttle from the mainland returns for the guests. Juan leaves to seek out Penelope, Sam leaves out of mistrust for the group, with Dave following behind him. Putman leaves out of being haunted by dreams he had suffered whilst searching the jungle for clues, which culminated in his newfound reclusiveness. Dave manages to restore the electricity, seconds before the killer, having retrieved his machete, beheads Dave. Jenny and Lars are drawn by distorted music to the electricity hut where they find Dave's severed head. Thinking the killer is coming for them, Lars and Jenny hide under a bed. thinking quickly, Jenny places a nearby pair of handcuffs on what she believed to be the killer's feet, only to realize that she handcuffed Putman by mistake. just as Jenny and Lars come out of hiding, the killer appears and starts moving towards the trio. Putman attempts to fend off the killer by Launching Tennis balls at him with his racket, but the Killer craftily throws his Machete at Puttman, fatally stabbing him. With his terminal breath, he tells a guilty Jenny and Lars to hide. as Lars and Jenny follow his instructions, They hide in a shower and overhear Putman flippantly taunting the killer, before being repeatedly stabbed, thus ensuring his death. During a party in the nightclub, Jenny and Lars discover Dave's disembodied head. The Killer then reveals the corpses of his previous victims to the guests and a panic ensues. Juan, having discovered the deaths of Dave and Putman, whilst searching for Penelope, returns to join Lars and Jenny, with the killer's machete in his hand. Penelope, Juan, Lars and Jenny find Sam's apparently lifeless body in a mud bath. While they consider their next move, Sam leaps from the bath, forcefully snatches his stolen machete from Lars and grabs him. Sam reveals that although the castration rumor was false, he wanted to kill everyone on the island because Pete had intended to sell the island to the military, but decided to give the island to Dave, and also out of feeling betrayed that Rolo did not give him a bag of marijuana that he had previously loaned to him, instead lying about having none at all and simply sharing it with Stacy and Kelly, both respective events happening at the same time. Jealous and Enraged, Sam assumed that Dave would mismanage the resort and destroy it. Lars grabs the machete, allowing the others to escape. Penelope is lost among the party- crazed guests, and Jenny and Juan lock themselves in the nightclub. They see Sam drowning Penelope in a large tank. Juan smashes the tank and rescues Penelope. Sam prepares to kill them, but Lars appears and stabs Sam. Sam pursues Lars, Jenny, Penelope, and Juan as they escape through the jungle. Cornered on a cliff, they jump to the water below. They find the resort's damaged boats, and try to cobble together enough working parts to leave the island. Sam appears and kills Juan, then attacks Jenny and Penelope. noticing this, Lars breaks his vow of pacifism and overcomes Sam, and Sam is bisected by a rope attached to the power boat.
