    "text": "Bryan Richard Cullen is a James B. Duke professor of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina. Cullen was the Founding Director of the Duke University Center for Virology. == Early life and education == Cullen was born in December 1951 in Bradford, England, where he graduated head of his class from Thornton Grammar School in 1970. In 1973, he received a B.Sc. in biochemistry from Warwick University, England and in 1974, he received an M.Sc. in virology from Birmingham University, England. Dr. Cullen emigrated to the US in 1974, where he received a Ph.D. in microbiology from Rutgers University, New Jersey, in 1984. He became a US citizen in 1992. == Research == Cullen and his laboratory are currently studying the regulation of viral mRNA expression by epitranscriptomic modifications and the use of CRISPR/Cas as a potential approach to the treatment of chronic diseases caused by DNA viruses. Cullen discovered the phenomenon of \u201ctranscriptional interference\u201d in retroviruses and showed that this explained why proviral 5\u2019LTRs are active while 3\u2019 LTRs are silenced. After starting his own research group in 1984, he demonstrated that the HIV-1 Tat protein activates viral transcription and that the HIV-1 Rev protein induces viral RNA nuclear export. He demonstrated that HIV-1 readily infects non-dividing cells, an unexpected result that overturned then prevalent dogma, and showed that a single variable loop in the Envelope protein, the V3 loop, controls HIV-1 tissue tropism. His laboratory was the first to express and functionally characterize microRNAs in mammalian cells and the first to identify and functionally characterize the microRNAs encoded by the herpesviruses KHSV, EBV and HSV-1. Recently, his laboratory was the first to report that several distinct epitranscriptomic modifications added to viral mRNAs promote viral gene expression and replication. == Awards and honors == Cullen was the recipient of the 1989 Ely Lilly Molecular Biology Award. He was awarded a distinguished fellowship by Durham University, UK in 2007. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology since 2009 and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science since 2011. He was named one of the top peer reviewers by the Journal of Virology in 2009 and 2011 and has been identified as a highly cited scientist by both Clarivate Analytics at Web of Science and by Thomson Reuters annually since 2001. He was awarded an honorary doctorate of science (D.Sc.) degree by Warwick University in 2016. ==Key publications== * Cullen, Bryan R., Lomedico, Peter T. and Ju, Grace.
