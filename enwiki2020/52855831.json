But no one can imagine the danger they are facing from Onofre Villahermosa, a charming, handsome, friendly neighbour who is actually a criminal, a murderer and psychopath who has installed hidden cameras all over the building to monitor the lives of the occupants and manipulate them like puppets while trying to ensure no one discovers who he really is. Several years before, Ana de los \u00c1ngeles had a chance encounter with Guillermo who helped to heal her pet dog after it had an accident in the countryside, and it was love at first sight for the two of them. However, they meet years later in the worst of circumstances: she is engaged to his cousin Crist\u00f3bal, while he is married and has a young daughter. All of the characters will fall in love at different ages, falling in love for the first time, after a divorce, after already having grown up children or even grandchildren. But what all these couples have in common is that love will be very difficult, even impossible. == Cast == === Starring === * Michelle de Andrade as Ana de los \u00c1ngeles Barranco Mora * Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Barreto as Guillermo Luis * Luis Ger\u00f3nimo Abreu as Onofre Villahermosa / Pedro P\u00e9rez \"El Fantasma\" === Also starring === * Mar\u00eda Antonieta Duque as L\u00e1zara Mart\u00ednez * Rafael Romero as Venancio Ru\u00edz * Sonia Villamizar as Nancy Sosa de Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez * Sim\u00f3n Pestana as Carlos Enrique Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez * Patricia Schwarzgruber as Marilda Cienfuegos * Jos\u00e9 Manuel Su\u00e1rez as Luis \"Luisito\" Mart\u00ednez * Adri\u00e1n Delgado as Crist\u00f3bal Andr\u00e9s Blanco * Aroldo Betancourt as Pablo Barranco * Laureano Olivarez as Rafael \"Rafucho\" Tadeo * Jos\u00e9 Luis Zuleta as Beltr\u00e1n Parra * Dora Mazzone as Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Mora de Barranco * Eulalia Siso as Carlota Miguelina Mart\u00ednez * Juan Carlos Gardi\u00e9 as Jairo Jes\u00fas Bracho * F\u00e9lix Loreto as Conrado Sosa Berm\u00fadez * Liliana Mel\u00e9ndez as Pura de Bracho * Adriana Romero as Clara Cienfuegos de Parra * Edmary Fuentes as Micaela Mart\u00ednez * Melissa \u00c1lvarez as Mireya * Michael Reyes as Carlos \"Carlitos\" Iba\u00f1ez Sosa * Karlis Romero as Purita Bracho * Mandi Meza as Yenny Coromoto * \u00c1ngel Casallas as Pedro \"Pedrote\" Mart\u00ednez * Alejandra Machado as Patricia Patricia Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez Sosa *Sabrina Gomez as Cristina *Alessandro Bastidas as Mario *Jonathan Manrique as Jonathan === Guest Appearance === * Javier Vidal as Onofre Villahermosa * Daniela Alvarado as Danielita *Carmen Julia \u00c1lvarez as Alicia Leal de Blanco *Alejandro Mata as Fernando Blanco *Josu\u00e9 Villae as Claudio Gallardo N\u00fa\u00f1ez *Jord\u00e1n Mendoza as Su\u00e1rez *Yugui L\u00f3pez as Perro de agua *Marycarmen Sobrino as Olga Villahermosa == Production == === Casting === On May 13, 2016 Sheryl Rubio and Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Barreto were confirmed as the protagonists of the series, In July 2016, Rubio confirmed her departure from production due to the current problems and insecurity that occur in Venezuela and explained: After the incident Monica Monta\u00f1\u00e9s had to rewrite the character that would play Rubio, because she had been working with the character based on the actress for months.
