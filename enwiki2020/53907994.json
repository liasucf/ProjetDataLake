It was named for John Higgins. In 1922 Martha Robison, a worker for the Board of National Missions of the Presbyterian Church, arrived for a three-month stay to establish housing for a missionary and decided to live there permanently. In November 1929 she received a letter from her cousin, John Markle, a coal magnate, who offered her help. Markle and the John and Mary R. Markle Foundation provided funds for a building, completed in 1931, containing a community library, a meeting room, a clinic, and on the upper floor spaces for woodwork, weaving, and pottery. The local people sold crafts, honey, and molasses; Eleanor Roosevelt visited and made a purchase on July 3, 1934.Kanigel, pp. 55\u201357. The Markle Building also temporarily housed the local school. It formed part of a group of masonry buildings including the Holland Memorial Church and Kirksedge Cottage.\"History Association Meeting\", Estatoee, XIII.2, Yancey History Association, May 1998, p. 1.

The Markle Foundation was the major beneficiary of John Markle's will on his death in 1933, but later changed its focus and cut off funding to Higgins. ==Jane Jacobs== Jane Jacobs, the urban activist and writer, was Robison's niece and lived with her in Higgins for six months in 1934.Kanigel, pp. 55, 58. She later used Higgins, under the name \"Henry\", as an example in Cities and the Wealth of Nations,Jane Jacobs, Cities and the Wealth of Nations: Principles of Economic Life, New York: Random House, 1984, , pp. 124\u201329. analyzing its decline as the result of its being cut off by bad roads from cities, so that the people had been reduced to subsistence and over generations had forgotten the skills they once had, and even that such skills existed; for example, that a church could be built of stone.Vital Little Plans: The Short Works of Jane Jacobs, ed.
