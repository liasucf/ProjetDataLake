He was named Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2014 \"for contributions to micromachined gyroscopes\". He has been also elected President of the IEEE Sensors Council. ==Education and career== Shkel was educated at the Moscow State University where in 1991 he got his diploma in applied mechanics. In 1997, he got his Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison and from 1997 to 1999 served as a postdoc at the University of California, Berkeley. Since 2000, Shkel is a faculty member at the University of California, Irvine, and from 2009 to 2013, he was on leave from academia serving as a Program Manager in the Microsystems Technology Office of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Dr. Shkel has been on a number of editorial boards, most recently as Editor of IEEE/ASME Journal of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (JMEMS) and the founding chair of the IEEE Inertial Sensors (INERTIAL). Dr. Shkel has been also awarded in 2013 the Office of the Secretary of Defense Medal for Exceptional Public Service, the 2009 IEEE Sensors Council Technical Achievement Award, and the 2005 NSF CAREER award. His professional interests, reflected in over 250 publications, two books, and 40 U.S. Patents, include high performance inertial sensors, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and implantable vestibular prosthetics. ==References== ==External links== * Category:20th-century births Category:Living people Category:Russian engineers Category:Moscow State University alumni Category:University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison alumni Category:University of California, Irvine faculty Category:Fellow Members of the IEEE Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ",
