Subsequent enhanced ports to the Dreamcast and to the PlayStation 2 as After... ~Wasureemu Kizuna~ were released. Both ports feature their own exclusive characters and new scenarios not in the original PC release. ==Gameplay== The gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the duration of the game is spent on simply reading the text that will appear on the screen; this text represents either dialogue between the various characters, or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Every so often, the player will come to a \"decision point\" where he or she is given the chance to choose from options that are displayed on the screen, typically two to three at a time. During these times, gameplay pauses until a choice is made that furthers the plot in a specific direction, depending on which choice the player makes. ==Characters== * * * * * * * * * * * ==Release== After.. was first introduced in Japan on June 27, 2003, as a CD-ROM or a DVD-ROM playable on a Microsoft Windows PC.
