It can be found in the cliff dwelling city of Hruboskalsko, in the Bohemian Paradise (\u010cesk\u00fd r\u00e1j). The city was built on three sandstone cliffs in the second half of the thirteenth century by Counts of the Waldstein family. After 1420 the castle was occupied by the Hussites, then later by robber barons. In 1621 the abandoned castle was bought back by the Waldsteins, whose most illustrious member was Albrecht von Wallenstein. During the peak of the Baroque period, they built a pilgrimage church, dedicated to John of Nepomuk, in 1722 on the ruins of the castle. ==See also== *List of castles in the Czech Republic *Rot\u0161tejn Castle ==Gallery== Image:Castle valdstejn 002.jpg|Castle Waldstein Image:Castle valdstejn 003.jpg|Castle Waldstein Image:Castle valdstejn 004.jpg|Castle Waldstein Image:Castle valdstejn 005.jpg|Castle Waldstein ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Castles in the Czech Republic Category:Castles in the Liberec Region Category:Museums in the Liberec Region Category:Historic house museums in the Czech Republic ",
