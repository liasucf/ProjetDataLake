    "text": "LGBT adult percentage by state in 2015-2016 The demographics of sexual orientation and gender identity in the United States have been studied in the social sciences in recent decades. A 2017 Gallup poll concluded that 4.5% of adult Americans identified as LGBT with 5.1% of women identifying as LGBT, compared with 3.9% of men. A different survey in 2016, from the Williams Institute, estimated that 0.6% of U.S. adults identify as transgender. Studies from several nations, including the U.S., conducted at varying time periods, have produced a statistical range of 1.2 to 6.8 percent of the adult population identifying as LGBT. Online surveys tend to yield higher figures than other methods, a likely result of the higher degree of anonymity of Internet surveys, and demographic of those utilizing online platforms which elicit reduced levels of socially desirable responding. The U.S. Census Bureau does not ask about sexual orientation in the United States Census. ==State-by- state summary== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"; style=\"text- align:center; width:100%\" |- !

However, one is much more likely to encounter gay residents in San Francisco, Seattle, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Boston as a higher percentage of those cities' residents are gay or lesbian. The U.S. metropolitan areas with the most gay residents are the New York, New York\u2013Northern New Jersey\u2013Long Island, New York metro with 568,903; followed by Los Angeles\u2013Long Beach\u2013Santa Ana, California with 442,211; and the Chicago- Naperville-Joliet, Illinois-Indiana-Wisconsin metro with 288,748.Note: the study cited is unclear as to the exact metro NY area that is included; on table 5, page 8, \"New York\u2013Northern New Jersey\u2013Long Island\" is included, but in Appendix 2, page 15, Pennsylvania also seems to be included as it states \"New York\u2013Northern New Jersey\u2013Long Island, New York\u2013NJ\u2013PA\" The charts below show a list of the top U.S. cities (in alphabetical order), metropolitan areas, and states with the highest population of gay residents and the highest percentage of gay residents (GLB population as a percentage of total residents based on available census data).Gary J.

(1990). Homosexuality/Heterosexuality: Concepts of Sexual Orientation. The Kinsey Institute Series. New York: Oxford University Press. ====1990==== An extensive study on sexuality in general was conducted in the United States. A significant portion of the study was geared towards homosexuality. The results found that 8.6% of women and 10.1% of men had at one point in their life experienced some form of homosexuality. Of this group, 87% of women and 76% of men reported current same-sex attractions, 41% of women and 52% of men had sex with someone of the same gender, and 16% of women and 27% of men identified as LGBT. ====1990\u20131992==== The American National Health Interview Survey conducts household interviews of the civilian non-institutionalized population. The results of three of these surveys, done in 1990\u201391 and based on over 9,000 responses each time, found between 2% and 3% of the people responding said yes to a set of statements which included \"You are a man who has had sex with another man at some time since 1977, even one time.\"Dawson, D. & Hardy, A.M.

National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control, Advance Data, 204, 1990\u20131992. ====1992==== The National Health and Social Life Survey asked 3,432 respondents whether they had any homosexual experience. The findings were 1.3% for women within the past year, and 4.1% since 18 years; for men, 2.7% within the past year, and 4.9% since 18 years.Summary of The National Health and Social Life Survey (\"The Sex Survey\") ====1993==== The Alan Guttmacher Institute of sexually active men aged 20\u201339 found that 2.3% had experienced same-sex sexual activity in the last ten years, and 1.1% reported exclusive homosexual contact during that time. ====1993==== Researchers Samuel and Cynthia Janus surveyed American adults aged 18 and over by distributing 4,550 questionnaires; 3,260 were returned and 2,765 were usable. The results of the cross-sectional (not random) nationwide survey stated 9% of men and 5% of women reported having had homosexual experiences \"frequently\" or \"ongoing\". In another measure, 4% of men and 2% of women self-identified as homosexual.Janus, Samuel S. & Janus, Cynthia L. (1993). The Janus Report on Sexual Behavior.

Subjects were asked a number of questions, including questions relating to same-sex activity. This was done using two methods\u2014a pencil and paper method, and via computer, supplemented by a verbal rendition of the questionnaire heard through headphones\u2014which obtained vastly different results. There was a 400% increase in males reporting homosexual activity when the computer-audio system was used: from a 1.5% to 5.5% positive response rate; the homosexual behavior with the greatest reporting difference (800%, adjusted) was to the question \"Ever had receptive anal sex with another male\": 0.1% to 0.8%. ===2000s=== ====2000==== During the 2000 US presidential election campaign, market research firm Harris Interactive studied the prevalence of a gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender identity employing three distinct methods. In phone interviews, 2% of the population self-identified as LGBT. Using in-person surveys with a blind envelope, that grew to 4%, and using online polls 6%. The group concluded that the difference between methods was due to the greater level of anonymity and privacy to online surveys, which provides more comfort to respondents to share their experiences. ====2003==== Smith's 2003 analysis of National Opinion Research Center dataAmerican Sexual Behavior: Trends, Socio-Demographic Differences, and Risk Behavior states that 4.9% of sexually active American males have had a male sexual partner since age 18, but that \"since age 18 less than 1% are [exclusively] gay and 4+% bisexual\". In the top twelve urban areas however, the rates are double the national average. Smith adds, \"It is generally believed that including adolescent behavior would further increase these rates.\" The NORC data has been criticised because the original design sampling techniques were not followed, and depended upon direct self-report regarding masturbation and same sex behaviors. (For example, the original data in the early 1990s reported that approximately 40% of adult males had never masturbated\u2014a finding inconsistent with some other studies.) ====2003==== In a telephone survey of 4,193 male residents of New York City, 91.3% of men identified as straight, 3.7% as gay, and 1.2% as bisexual. 1.7% said they were in doubt or were not sure and 2.1% declined to answer. 12.4% of men who responded to the sexual orientation question, reported sex exclusively with men in the 12 months prior to the survey. Most of them (c. 70%) identified as heterosexual. ====2005==== The American Community Survey from the U.S. Census estimated 776,943 same-sex couples in the country as a whole, representing about 0.5% of the population. ====2006==== Fried's 2008 analysis of General Social Survey data shows the percentage of United States males reporting homosexual activity for three time periods: 1988\u20131992, 1993\u20131998, and 2000\u20132006. These results are broken out by political party self-identification, and indicate increasing percentages, particularly among Democrats (perhaps reflecting, in the authors' view, either a shift of political allegiance among gay Americans, or increasing likelihood of acknowledging a homosexual orientation).Fried, Joseph, Democrats and Republicans \u2013 Rhetoric and Reality (New York: Algora Publishing, 2008), 10. ====2007==== Cornell University, carrying out research into sexuality amongst a representative sample of more than 20,000 young Americans, published that 14.4% of young women were not strictly heterosexual in behavior, a group that included lesbian and bisexual women; 5.6% of young men self-identified as being gay or bisexual. ====2008==== National Election Pool's exit polling showed self-identified gay, lesbian, and bisexual voters at 4% of the voting population in the 2008 United States presidential election.

Retrieved on 2011-02-10. ===2010s=== ====2000\u20132010==== The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys interviewed a nationally representative sample of 11,744 adults aged 20 to 59 between 2003 and 2010. One hundred and eighty (1.5%) self-reported a homosexual orientation and 273 (2.3%) a bisexual one. ====2010==== The National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior surveyed nearly 6,000 people nationwide between the ages of 14 and 94 through an online methodology and found that 7% of women and 8% of men identify as gay, lesbian or bisexual.National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior. Nationalsexstudy.indiana.edu. Retrieved on 2010-10-26. ====2010==== Using a phone methodology, the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey found, in a sample of about 10,000 women and 8,000 men, that 1.3% of women and 2% of men identify as gay or lesbian, and 1.2% of men and 2.2% of women identify as bisexual.https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_sofindings.pdf ====2012==== A Gallup report published in October 2012 by the Williams Institute reported that 3.4% of US adults identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. Minorities were more likely to identify as non-heterosexual; 4.6% of blacks, 4.0% of Hispanics and 3.2% of whites. Younger people, aged 18\u201329, were three times more likely to identify as LGBT than seniors over the age of 65, the numbers being 6.4% and 1.9%, respectively. ====2012==== The National Election Pool found that, among voters on Election Day, 5% identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. ====2013==== In the first large-scale government survey measuring Americans' sexual orientation, the NHIS reported in July 2014 that 1.6% of Americans identify as gay or lesbian, and 0.7% identify as bisexual. 1.5% of women self-identify as lesbian and 0.9% consider themselves bisexual, while 1.8% of men consider themselves gay and 0.4% identify as bisexual. ====2002\u20132013 National Survey of Family Growth==== The National Survey of Family Growth is a nationally representative, multi-year survey of teenagers and adults aged 15\u201344. The sexual orientation items are presented only to interviewees over age 18. Results are presented separately for women and men. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"; style=\"text-align:center; width:10%\" |+ Women |- ! !Gay/lesbian !Bisexual !Something else !Heterosexual !Did not report |- |2002 |1.3% |2.8% |3.8% |90.3% |1.8% |- |2006\u20132010 |1.2% |3.9% |0.4% |93.6% |0.8% |- |2011\u20132013 |1.3% |5.5% |\u2014 |92.3% |0.9% |- |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"; style=\"text-align:center; width:10%\" |+ Men |- ! !Gay/lesbian !Bisexual !Something else !Heterosexual !Did not report |- |2002 |2.3% |1.8% |3.9% |90.2% |1.8% |- |2006\u20132010 |1.8% |1.2% |0.2% |95.6% |1.2% |- |2011\u20132013 |1.9% |2.0% |\u2014 |95.1% |1.0% |- |} ====2013==== In an experiment, the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded that the share of the population that is non-heterosexual has been significantly underestimated in surveys using traditional questioning methods, even if anonymous. In this study, it was found that, in all three facets of sexual orientation (identity, attraction, and behavior), the percentage of individuals who recognized themselves as non-heterosexual was larger when the survey method in use was the item randomized response, known to reduce socially desirable responding, in lieu of questions with direct responses. However, because the study was based on online volunteer samples and was therefore not nationally representative, researchers make no suggestion as to the real size of the LGBT population. ====2013==== Writing in the opinion section of The New York Times in 2013, Seth Stephens-Davidowitz estimated that roughly 5% of American men are \"primarily attracted to men\". First, using Facebook data and Gallup poll results, he correlated the percentage of men who are openly gay with their state of birth and residence. Second, he measured what percentage of Google pornographic searches were for gay porn. The first method gave between 1% and 3%. The second showed that roughly 5% of men search for gay porn in every state. The figure was slightly higher in states considered gay-tolerant than in others. ====2014 General Social Survey behavior study==== A study has also found that, based on the GSS, the proportion of men and women who self-report ever having had a same-sex sexual partner has steadily increased since the early 1990s. In the 1989-1994 period, 4.53% of men and 3.61% of women self-reported homosexual sex ever, which grew to 8.18% of men and 8.74% of women in the 2010-2014 period. The augmentation is mainly due to those who self-report sex with both genders; among those who have only had sex with the same gender, no clear pattern of increase emerged throughout the periods analyzed.http://psy2.fau.edu/~shermanr/Gay&LesbianSex5-3-16.pdf; ====2014==== In a nationally representative telephone survey of 35,071 Americans, Pew Research found that 1,604, or 4.6%, of the sample identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual, and 32,439 (or 92.4%) as heterosexual, with the remainder refusing or being unable to provide an answer, or identifying as something else. ====2015==== In a nationally representative survey of 2,021 Americans carried out by Indiana University, it was found that 89.8% of men and 92.2% of women identify as heterosexual, 1.9% of men and 3.6% of women as bisexual, 5.8% of men and 1.5% of women consider themselves gay or lesbian, 0.5% of men and 1.3% of women identify as asexual, and 0.7% of men and 0.9% of women as other. ====2015==== The Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) survey of 2,314 millennials found that 88% identified as heterosexual, 4% as bisexual, 2% as gay, and 1% as lesbian. In a separate question, 1% identified as transgender. In total, 7% of millennials identified as LGBT. Three percent refused to identify their sexual orientation. The unaffiliated were more likely to identify as LGBT than the religious, as were Democratic-leaning millennials compared to the Republican-leaning. No differences were found along racial lines. ====2015==== In a YouGov survey of 1,000 adults, 2% of the sample identified as gay male, 2% as gay female, 4% as bisexual (of either sex), and 89% as heterosexual. ====2008\u20132016 General Social Survey identity polling==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center; width:30%\" |- ! !Gay/lesbian !Bisexual !Total |- |2008 |1.6% |1.1% |2.7% |- |2010 |1.2% |1.4% |2.6% |- |2012 |1.5% |2.2% |3.7% |- |2014 |1.7% |2.6% |4.3% |- |2016 |2.4% |3.0% |5.4% |} ====2016==== In National Election Pool's exit poll of over 24,500 Election Day voters, 5% identified as LGBT. ====2016==== Gallup's daily tracking phone survey found that the proportion of Americans who identify as LGBT in 2016 was 4.1% \u2013 which represents growth over the 3.6% registered when the question started being asked in 2012. Growth was highest among women, millennials, the non-religious, Hispanics, and Asians, and happened across income and educational categories. Among the religious, and older generations than millennials, the share of those self-identifying as LGBT remained stable or varied negatively. ====2016==== A female-only survey found that 7% of American women identify as gay or bisexual. ====2016==== According to a national survey organized by the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation and Harris Poll, 12% of the US adult population is either a sexual minority (i.e., gay, lesbian, bisexual, asexual or pansexual) or identifies as something other than cisgender. This proportion was highest among millennials (20%) and decreased with age, reaching 5% among those who were aged 72 or more. ====2016\u20132017==== The Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) conducted a survey of over 100,000 U.S. residents from January 2016 to January 2017 asking, among a variety of attitude and demographic questions, whether or not they consider themselves LGBT. 4.4% of respondents answered affirmatively to that question, and 90.4% responded negatively. The remainder 5.3% did not know or refused to answer.http://ava.prri.org/#demographics/2016/States/lgbt_identity/m/national ====2017==== In a nationally representative survey organized by Kantar TNS, 87% of American men aged 18 to 30 years identified as heterosexual, 7% as homosexual, 4% as bisexual, and 1% as other. ==Footnotes== Category:Demographics of the United States Demographics of the United States ",
