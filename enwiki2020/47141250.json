The museum currently has branches in all of the municipalities in Nordm\u00f8re:Nordm\u00f8re Museum. two departments in Sm\u00f8la (the Sm\u00f8la museum and Norwegian Marsh Museum), in Aver\u00f8y and Eide (the Old Kvernes Rural Museum), Tingvoll, Surnadal (the \u00c5sen Village Museum, Kleiva Poet's Home, and Svinvik Arboretum), Rindal, Aure (the Kr\u00e5ksund Fishing Museum), Halsa (a museum dedicated to the traditional geitb\u00e5t 'goat boat' and the Husasnotra boat-building area), and Sunndal (the Sunndal Museum in the Leikvin Heritage Park). The museum has a cooperation agreement with the municipality of Gjemnes. The head of the museum is St\u00e5le Tangen. The museum was established as the Kristiansund Museum in 1894, and from the beginning the main building was an exhibition pavilion from the large-scale fishing exhibition held in 1892. Together with the museum's founder, Anders Sandvig, the committed young museologist Wilhelm Lund laid plans in Lillehammer for a major open-air cultural museum in Kristiansund. The Almsk\u00e5r farmhouse, one of the last authentic open-hearth farmhouses from Nordm\u00f8re, was moved to Kristiansund. The museum also acquired a raised granary before it was realized that the weather in Kristiansund was not suited to a regular open-air museum with transferred buildings. The Kristiansund Museum was badly damaged when the city with its old wooden houses was bombed by German aircraft in April 1940. The museum lost most of its collection when the pavilion burned down. In the 1960s, the small open-air museum was moved to Dalen Farm on the outskirts of the city, which was regarded as preservation-worthy. In 1965 the museum opened a new fireproof brick building at the Knudtzondal Farm on the city's outskirts. In 1980, the museum focused on heritage conservation at the harbor in Kristiansund, where the museum is represented by the Norwegian Dried Cod Museum and Mellem Shipyard, where historical sailing ships are also restored. ==References== ==External links== * Nordm\u00f8re Museum homepage Category:Culture in M\u00f8re og Romsdal Category:Museums in M\u00f8re og Romsdal Category:Nordm\u00f8re Category:Aver\u00f8y Category:Sm\u00f8la Category:Tingvoll Category:Surnadal Category:Rindal Category:Sunndal Category:Museums established in 1894 Category:1894 establishments in Norway ",
