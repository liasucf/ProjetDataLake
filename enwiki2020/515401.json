    "text": "Entre R\u00edos (, \"Between Rivers\") is a central province of Argentina, located in the Mesopotamia region. It borders the provinces of Buenos Aires (south), Corrientes (north) and Santa Fe (west), and Uruguay in the east. Its capital is Paran\u00e1 (250,000 inhabitants), which lies on the Paran\u00e1 River, opposite the city of Santa Fe. Together with C\u00f3rdoba and Santa Fe, since 1999, the province is part of the economic-political association known as the Center Region. ==History== San Jos\u00e9 Palace, home of the first President of modern Argentina, Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza The first inhabitants of the area that is now Entre R\u00edos were the Charr\u00faa and Chan\u00e1 who each occupied separate parts of the region. Spaniards entered in 1520, when Rodr\u00edguez Serrano ventured up the Uruguay River searching for the Pacific Ocean. The first permanent Spanish settlement was erected in the current La Paz Department at the end of the 16th century. As governor of Asunci\u00f3n first and then of Buenos Aires, Hernandarias conducted expeditions to Entre R\u00edos unexplored lands. Juan de Garay, after founding Santa Fe, explored this area, which he called la otra banda (\"the other bank\"). However, the region remained entirely indigenous and uninhabited by Europeans until a group of colonists from neighbouring Santa Fe Province settled on the Bajada del Paran\u00e1 in the late seventeenth century, now the site of the provincial capital. At the same time towns appear, which we now know as Nogoy\u00e1, Victoria, Gualeguay, Gualeguaych\u00fa, Concepci\u00f3n del Uruguay and Concordia. Tom\u00e1s de Rocamora further explored the area in 1783 under the threat of a Portuguese invasion from Brazil, and gave official status to many of the above-mentioned towns. He was also the first to refer to the region as Entre R\u00edos. At this stage, European settlement was minimal, though during the May Revolution, the few colonists in the cities along the Paran\u00e1 shore supported Manuel Belgrano and his army on his way to Paraguay. On September 29, 1820, the leader (caudillo) Francisco Ram\u00edrez declared the territory an autonomous entity, the Republic of Entre R\u00edos. This lasted until his assassination on July 10 of the next year. In 1853, in a meeting of all the provinces except Buenos Aires, Paran\u00e1 was elected as the capital of the Argentine Confederation, and the Governor of Entre R\u00edos and leader (caudillo) Urquiza as its first president. The provincial capital was moved to Concepci\u00f3n del Uruguay. Later Urquiza, who had first won against Buenos Aires at the Battle of Cepeda in 1859, let his troops move back in the even Battle of Pav\u00f3n in 1861, which allowed his rival Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre from Buenos Aires to become president. At the time he was fulfilling his third term as governor of the province from 1860 to 1864 and after a voluntary interruption was reelected in 1886, but he was assassinated in 1870 after altogether 16 years of governing before finishing his mandate, which had probably been ordered by his supportor Ricardo L\u00f3pez Jord\u00e1n, not trusting him anymore. Urquiza encouraged immigration through \"colonization contracts\", setting up many agricultural colonies with European (mainly Volga Germans, Russians (including Russian Jews and Poles), Italians, Swiss and French) settlers. According to data of the 1903 census, of the 425,373 inhabitants of the province, 153,067 were immigrants. ==Economy== Hotel Mayorazgo, Paran\u00e1.
