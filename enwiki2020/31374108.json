It is owned by the Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority. The airport is located on the site of the former Naval Air Station Brunswick. The 2005 Base Realignment and Closure committee recommended the closure of NAS Brunswick. The airport was opened for civilian aircraft use in June 2011. The airport is the central focus of Brunswick Landing: Maine's Center for Innovation, a business park. Although most U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, this airport is assigned BXM by the FAA but has no designation from the IATA (which assigned BXM to Batom Airport in Indonesia). The airport's ICAO identifier is KBXM. == Facilities == Brunswick Executive Airport covers an area of 720 acres (291 ha) at an elevation of 75 feet (23 m) above mean sea level.
