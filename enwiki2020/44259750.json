    "text": "1st of the Month Vol. 4 is the fourth EP by American rapper Cam'ron. The EP was released on October 1, 2014, by Killa. ==Background== In October 2013, Cam'ron announced that he would release an EP and an episode of his web series every month starting on January 1, 2014. In February 2014, he gave an update on the EP plans, saying: \"I got the First of the Month project coming out probably next month. Dame put together the A-Trak collaboration which is called Federal Reserve. me and Smoke DZA got a project going on. It\u2019s like five different projects, basically what we\u2019re doing now is just trying to figure out the timing for everything. It\u2019s probably 150 new songs done.\" In an April 2014, interview with Mass Appeal, he explained why he decided to release a series of EP's, saying: \"Just setting everything up. Music has changed and it\u2019s always fun, but I like to make money while I\u2019m making music, so I just had to figure out a new strategy. Things are changing and if you don\u2019t change with the times you gon get stuck in the past. I\u2019ve been working on this thing called The First of the Month. I\u2019m putting out an EP every month with a 30-minute episode so you\u2019re not waiting a year or more for the next album.\" In May 2014, in an interview with MTV News, he spoke about the features on the EP's saying: \"The people that\u2019s gonna be on this project is Nicki Minaj, 2 Chainz, Wiz Khalifa, Estelle and Gunplay, so far.\" He also announced the first EP would be released on July 1, 2014, saying: \"The first one is July 1 for the visual, July 3 for the music. And we\u2019ll put it out \u2014 the visual \u2014 every first of the month. So, August 1 will be another visual, September 1. And then, whatever the first Tuesday is of every month, we\u2019ll be doing the music, as well.\" On September 17, 2014, the EP's first single \"Snapped\" featuring 2 Chainz was released. On September 22, 2014, the music video was released for \"Snapped\" featuring 2 Chainz. ==Critical reception== Darryl Robertson of XXL gave the album an XL, saying \"While the first half of the EP holds up, the second doesn\u2019t deliver. \u201cBaby Ain\u2019t Mine\u201d and \u201cF*ckin\u2019 Hater\u201d find Cam making lackluster attempts at singing about his dislike for women. If \u201cDumb Bitch\u201d from Vol. 3 wasn\u2019t enough of him talking crazy, these should be added to the growing list of songs. The problem lies that these aren\u2019t on par to what fans have heard in the past. 1st Of The Month, Vol. 4 concludes with the bass knocking track \u201c3rd Floor Flow,\u201d which finds Cam getting down and dirty like the Harlem streets during Alpo and Rich Porter days. It\u2019s an excellent conclusion to Vol.4, despite the EP\u2019s minor mishaps. Just like the previous installments, the project leaves fans wanting more from the Dipset honcho. Until next month.\" ==Track listing== ==References== Category:2014 EPs Category:Cam'ron albums ",
