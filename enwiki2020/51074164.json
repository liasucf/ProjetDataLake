    "text": "Looking more like a small station rather than a major transportation hub, it was obvious that in order to accommodate the increased services commencing after the complete opening of the P.A.Th.E./P., the station should be expanded. Construction begun in 2005 and after facing a series of delays it is expected to be finished within 2016. ==Plan== The platform number is going to be increased from 4 to 10. The platforms are going to be covered with canopies for most of their length and there is provision for a second floor with shops as well as a large roof that will cover the station. A new, underground passageway is also going to be built. ==History== The Athens Railway Station is the main rail station in the Athens urban area. It has now become the largest railway centre in Athens. One of the 2 in the Municipality of Athens, it serves all intercity trains as well as regional traffic and is the one closest to the city center, thus being the most important. Until 2005, the station had 4 tracks, all of which were served by platforms, as well as storage areas and sidings for freight trains, which were situated in the western side. The old, now dismantled metre gauge line to the Peloponesse was further west and there were no platforms to serve it: the Peloponissou Station further south was the calling point for these trains. After works for the expansion of the station begun in 2016, the sidings and storage areas were demolished and the metre gauge line was closed and the tracks were lifted. Construction for 6 additional tracks and platforms had already begun. During construction, the station remains open, with only 3 operational tracks. Now there are 6 operational tracks and 2 are under construction as well as the renovation of the 2 old platforms. Freight Trains go to Pelpoponissou `Station as well as the Athens-Elefsina line. ==Station roof== According to the masterplan of the expansion, there is provision for a larger building situated above the station. It will be connected to the station include station facilities, shops and restaurants and serve as the station's roof. There have been two proposals for this building, one by KLMF architects and the other one by the School of Architecture of the Athens University.
