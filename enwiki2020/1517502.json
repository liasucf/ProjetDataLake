    "text": "Out of the Vein is the third studio album by American rock band Third Eye Blind. Released on May 13, 2003, Out of the Vein is the band's first album with guitarist Tony Fredianelli, who replaced longtime guitarist Kevin Cadogan in 2000. It would also be Third Eye Blind's final album with Elektra Records as well as their final album with bassist Arion Salazar. Out of the Vein was recorded at the group's own Mourning Wood Studios in downtown San Francisco and at Skywalker Sound. Frontman Stephan Jenkins wanted the album to be called Crystal Baller, but was changed as the other members hated the original name.Reyes, Kimberly. \"He's So 'Vein'?\". Entertainment Weekly. May 9, 2003. == Background == Out of the Vein was originally scheduled to be released in the Spring of 2002, but was delayed several times.Author unknown. \"Third Eye Blind Not 'Blinded' to Success\". Yahoo! News. May 9, 2003. According to Jenkins, some of the reasons for the delay stemmed from a self-imposed pressure to live up to Third Eye Blind's previous successes, leading him to rewrite lyrics. By the time the album was released, Elektra Records was in the midst of being absorbed into Atlantic Records, and Jenkins contends the group was not a priority: \"Our record company ceased to exist the month the record was released,\" \"Elektra Records imploded. It was just letterhead.\"Uhelszki, Jaan. \"Third Eye Blind\u2019s Second Coming\". San Francisco Chronicle. March 11, 2007. Jenkins felt that Out of the Vein would mark \"a new period for the band\",Guthrie, Julian. \"He Can See Clearly Now\". San Francisco Chronicle. April 20, 2003. and added that \"The first two albums were like two parts of the same piece. We've had a hiatus. This is a new beginning. We're developing a songbook that's getting richer.\"Hot Product. \"You're So 'Vein'\". billboard.com. May 12, 2003. The album cover is by photographer Mick Rock, and according to Jenkins screams \"rock joy\". The first 100,000 copies of the CD included a DVD documenting the making of the album. The DVD also contains footage of the band practicing songs off the album (such as \"Faster\") in the studio and plays clips of a song that has yet to be released titled Invisible. The vinyl version of the album, released in 2013 for the first time, includes different mixes of many songs from the original album. == Reception == The album had a strong debut at #12 on the Billboard 200 with 63,000 copies sold in its first week.Hasty, Katey. \"Marilyn Manson Posts 'Grotesque' At No. 1\". billboard.com.
