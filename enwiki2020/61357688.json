    "text": "Ernesto Deira (1928-1986) was an Argentine artist associated with the Nueva Figuraci\u00f3n (New Figuration) movement in Latin America. He studied with Leopoldo Torres Ag\u00fcero and Leopoldo Presas in the 1950s. Then, in 1961, he joined Jorge de la Vega, R\u00f3mulo Macci\u00f3 and Luis Felipe No\u00e9 in an exhibition entitled \"Otra Figuraci\u00f3n\". After the exhibition, they formed a group of the same name (Otra Figuraci\u00f3n), which shared studio space and exhibited together until 1966. Together they called for a return to figurative art, rejecting both abstraction and traditional forms of representation. Diera's own style was highly expressive, linear, and often grotesque. He later moved to Paris, where he died in 1986. ==References== Category:1928 births Category:1986 deaths Category:Argentine emigrants to France Category:Argentine artists ",
