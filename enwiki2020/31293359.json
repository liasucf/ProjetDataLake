    "text": "A classical approach to solve the Hypergraph bipartitioning problem is an iterative heuristic by Fiduccia and Mattheyses. This heuristic is commonly called the FM algorithm. == Introduction == FM algorithm is a linear time heuristic for improving network partitions. New features to K-L heuristic: * Aims at reducing net-cut costs; the concept of cutsize is extended to hypergraphs. * Only a single vertex is moved across the cut in a single move. * Vertices are weighted. * Can handle \"unbalanced\" partitions; a balance factor is introduced. * A special data structure is used to select vertices to be moved across the cut to improve running time. * Time complexity O(P), where P is the total # of terminals. Example of FM == F\u2013M heuristic: notation == Input: A hypergraph with a vertex (cell) set and a hyperedge (net) set * n(i): # of cells in Net i; e.g., n(1) = 4 * s(i): size of Cell i * p(i): # of pins of Cell i; e.g., p(1) = 4 * C: total # of cells; e.g., C = 13 * N: total # of nets; e.g., N = 4 * P: total # of pins; P = p(1) + \u2026 + p(C) = n(1) + \u2026 + n(N) * Area ratio r, 0< r<1 Output: 2 partitions * Cutsetsize is minimized * |A|/(|A|+|B|) \u2248 r ==See also== * Graph partition * Kernighan\u2013Lin algorithm ==References== Category:Electronic design automation ",
