    "text": "Risco Plateado is a stratovolcano in Argentina, with an elevation of above sea level. With a prominence of , it is one of the many ultra prominent peaks in the Andes. The equilibrium line altitude of the volcano lies at an altitude of . This stratovolcano has a wide caldera with eruptive centres on its northeastern and southwestern margins. These centres are aligned on a northeast-trending fracture that also includes a monogenetic centre northeast of the caldera (GVP). The volcano has produced long lava flows, although the more proximal parts of the flow were later degraded by glaciation. The volcano has been assigned a Holocene age given the young appearance of some of its eruption products. The volcanism was at first dacitic and later changed to basaltic andesite (GVP). ==See also== * List of volcanoes in Argentina * List of Ultras of South America ==References== * ==External links== * \"Cerro Risco Plateado, Argentina\" on Peakbagger Category:Stratovolcanoes of Argentina Category:Subduction volcanoes Category:Mountains of Argentina Category:Polygenetic volcanoes Category:Holocene volcanoes ",
