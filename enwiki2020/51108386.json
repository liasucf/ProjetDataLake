When Ob\u00e8 was 18, he made a friendship with PartyNextDoor on Twitter, who at the time went by \"Jahron B\". At that time, he was always songwriting and producing, so he'd always send him beats.

In the fall of 2014, Oliver El-Khatib (Drake's manager and co-founder of OVO Sound) spoke to Ob\u00e8 and told him Drake is a fan of Detrooklyn. Because of that, Ob\u00e8 sent him music and got positive feedback. In February 2015, Ob\u00e8 co-produced, \"Star67\" for Drake, which appeared on If You're Reading This It's Too Late.
