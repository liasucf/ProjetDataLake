    "text": "Eugen Prym (15 December 1843 in D\u00fcren - 6 May 1913 in Bonn) was a German orientalist, who specialized in Semitic languages, especially Arabic and Aramaic. He was the brother of mathematician Friedrich Prym (1841\u20131915). He studied comparative linguistics and Oriental languages at the universities of Berlin, Leipzig and Bonn, receiving his doctorate in 1868 with a thesis on the Islamic polymath Ibn Khallikan. As a student, his influences included Heinrich Leberecht Fleischer in Leipzig and Johann Gildemeister at the University of Bonn. From November 1868, with Albert Socin, he carried out linguistic research for one and a half years in the Middle East. Following his return to Bonn, he gave lectures in Semitic languages at the University, where in 1890 he attained a full professorship. In addition to Semitic languages, he also taught classes on Sanskrit and Persian.Eugen Prym - Orientalist aus D\u00fcren Eifel - ZeitungHermann Diels, Hermann Usener, Eduard Zeller Briefwechsel edited by Dietrich Ehlers == Selected works == * Der neu-aram\u00e4ische Dialekt des Tur Abdin, 1881 - Neo-Aramaic dialect of Tur Abdin. * Kurdische sammlungen (2 volumes 1887\u201390, with Albert Socin) - Kurdish collections. * Annales quos scripsit Abu Djafar Mohammed Ibn Djarir At-Tabari, (multi-volume, 1879\u20131901); edition of Al-Tabari; with Michael Jan de Goeje and others. * Neuaram\u00e4ische M\u00e4rchen und andere Texte aus Malula in deutscher \u00dcbersetzung, haupts\u00e4chlich aus der Sammlung E.
