    "text": "Aspide (the Italian name for the adder) is an Italian medium range air-to-air and surface-to-air missile produced by Selenia (now part of the Alenia consortium). It is provided with semi-active radar homing seeker. It is very similar to the American AIM-7 Sparrow, using the same airframe, but at the moment of its introduction, the Aspide was provided with monopulse guide instead of the conic scan, which made it more resistant to ECM and more precise. This innovation appeared on the Sparrows only with the late AIM-7M version. Closed-loop hydraulics were also substituted for Sparrow's open-loop type, which gave Aspide better downrange maneuverability. This resemblance, and the fact that Selenia was provided with the technology know-how of the AIM-7 (around 1,000 of which it had produced under license), has generally led non-Italian press to refer to the Aspide as a Sparrow variant. However, the Aspide had original electronics and warhead, and a new and more powerful engine. Even the control surfaces are different, replacing the original triangular wings, fixed in the air-to-air and instead foldable in the surface- to-air version, to a newly designed common cropped delta fixed version. ==Design== Aspide, in its various versions, was used both in the air-to-air role, carried by Aeritalia F-104s in the apposite versions F-104S and F-104ASA, and in the surface-to-air naval role. In the latter role it has been replaced by the MBDA Aster. Naval Aspide launchers can be adapted to fire the Sparrow by merely switching a single circuit board. In the mid 1980s, China imported a small batch of the Aspide Mk.1 from Italy, then signed an agreement with Alenia to produce the missile locally under license. In 1989, China produced its first batch of Aspide Mk.1 missiles using imported parts from Italy. However, due to the European Union arms embargo imposed after the Tiananmen Square incident, China was unable to purchase additional Aspide kits. China subsequently developed its own missile family based on the Aspide Mk.1, with surface to air versions designated as the LY-60, and an air-to-air version designated as PL-10. The rocket engine of the Aspide is produced by Turkish missile manufacturer ROKETSAN. ==Variants== * Aspide Mk.1 - Similar to AIM-7E, with Selenia monopulse semi-active seeker and SNIA-Viscosa solid- propellant rocket motor. This version was popular with export customers, and sold to 17 countries. * Aspide Mk.2 - Improved version with active radar- homing seeker. Development was shelved in favor of better missiles, such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM. * Aspide 2000 - Surface-to-air version of the Aspide Mk.1, used on Italian Army Skyguard and Spada air-defense systems. ==Operators== ;: - MEKO 360 ships, 150 Mk1 ordered in 1979 and delivered in 1983-1984 ;: - 100 Aspide 2000 ordered in 1996 and delivered in 2001-2004 - S\u00e3o Paulo aircraft carrier, Niter\u00f3i class frigates ;: - 90 Aspide Mk.1 ordered in 1986 and delivered in 1987-1991.
