He is known for Havelock's law (1907).Charney, E.

(Durham College of Physical Science was renamed Armstrong College in 1904.) He matriculated in 1897 at St John's College, Cambridge and graduated there B.A. in 1900 and M.A. in 1904. From 1903 to 1909 he was a Fellow of St John's College, Cambridge. He was a professor of applied mathematics at Armstrong College from 1914 until his retirement in 1945. (In the 1930s Armstrong College became part of King's College, Durham, which in the 1960s became part of Newcastle University.) ==Havelock's law== Relationship between the refractive index n and the wavelength \\lambda of a homogeneous material that transmits light: :k = B \\ \\lambda n/{(n-1)^2}, where ::k = constant for the material at a given temperature ::B = Kerr constant of the material (The Kerr constant is approximately proportional to the absolute temperature.) ::\\lambda = wavelength of the material ::n = refractive index of the material ==Awards and honours== *1914 \u2013 F.R.S. *1956 \u2013 William Froude Gold Medal of the Royal Institution of Naval Architects *1957 \u2013 Knighthood ==Selected publications== * * * * * * * * * * * ==References== ==External links== *Havelock (Thomas) Archive, Special Collections - University Library - Newcastle University *Havelock Hall, Special Collections \u2013 University Library \u2013 Newcastle University Category:1877 births Category:1968 deaths Category:20th-century English mathematicians Category:Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge Category:Fellows of St John's College, Cambridge Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Fluid dynamicists ",
