    "text": "Novolipetsk Steel plant Novolipetsk Steel, or NLMK, is one of the four largest steel companies in Russia. NLMK's share of domestic crude steel production is about 21%. It primarily produces flat steel products, semi-finished steel products and electrical steels. NLMK also produces specialty coated steels, plus high-ductility and micro-alloyed steels. ==History== Historically, the Lipetsk area in central Russia has had substantial iron ore deposits. In 1702, Peter the Great ordered the construction of an iron foundry there. In 1931, Novolipetsk Iron and Steel began construction of a plant on the site of the iron ore mine.History of NLMK since 1931 Prospering down through the decades, Novolipetsk became a joint-stock company in 1992 and then in 1993 began the process of privatization by distributing company shares to its employees. The company seems to be acquisitive; see list of related organizations. In 1998, Vladimir Lisin became the chairman. The manufacturing area in Lipetsk covers 27 square kilometers. Less than half of NLMK's output of steel is sold in Russia. The company's primary source of iron ore is now Stoilensky GOK, a company which is 350 km from the mills at Lipetsk. ==Business== Currently Novolipetsk Steel (NLMK) located in Lipetsk is one of the world's most profitable steel companies per tonne of production and by far the most profitable steel-making company in Russia, with an EBITDA margin of $2,28 bln (-3%). Company's revenue (US GAAP) in 2013 is $10,909 bln, net profit \u2014 $189 mln. NLMK's assets are technically advanced and on par with its global peers. NLMK is fully self-sufficient in iron-ore through its 97% stake in Stoilensky GOK, Russia's 3rd-largest iron ore producer. On December 15, 2005, the company listed 42 million (8.3% of the total number of shares) of its Global Depositary Shares (GDSs) on the London Stock Exchange (). Each GDS represents 10 ordinary shares. In June 2006 NLMK altered its dividend policy and increased its target payout ratio from 15% to 20% of its net income under US GAAP. The company pursues the goal of bringing its total dividends over a five-year period to 30%. ===Acquisitions=== NLMK's global M&A; activity has been focused on assets which the company could effectively leverage for processing its low-cost slabs into high-value-added products in its key export markets. The largest of NLMK's acquisitions was a 50% stake in a joint venture with the Duferco Group in December 2006. The venture includes one steel plant and five rolling mills in Western Europe and the United States. The joint venture also includes service and distribution facilities located in Europe. * OJSC Dolomite, miner and processor of metallurgical dolomite, acquired in 1997 * OJSC Stagdok, miner and processor of fluxing limestone, acquired in 1999 * OJSC Stoilensky GOK, iron ore supplier, acquired in 2004 (97%) * OJSC TMTP, operator of the Black Sea port of Tuapse, acquired in 2004 (controlling interest) * License for the large coking coal deposit Zhernovskoie 1 in the Kuzbass region of Russia, acquired at State auction in 2005 * DanSteel A/S, Danish steel rolling company, acquired in 2006 * OJSC Altai-koks, acquired in 2006 * VIZ-Stal, the second-largest Russian electrical steel producer, acquired in 2006 * Sharon Coatings ==Ecology== Since 2007 NLMK has implemented a number of investment projects on environmental protection. In 2009 it stopped discharges of industrial wastewater into the river Voronezh. As the result of all the activities, the water consumption of the NLMK Group decreased from 120.4 million cubic meters per year in 2008 to 77.2 million cubic meters per year in 2012, and emissions into the atmosphere decreased by 40%. ==See also== * List of steel producers ==References== ==External links== * Official site - English-language version Category:Steel companies of Russia Category:Companies listed on the London Stock Exchange Category:Steel companies of the Russian SFSR Category:Companies listed on the Moscow Exchange Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1931 Category:Russian brands Category:1931 establishments in Russia Category:Companies based in Lipetsk Oblast ",
