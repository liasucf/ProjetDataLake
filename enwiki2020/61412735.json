Climbing guidebooks note that its northerly rocky ridge (that rises up from the col of , or \"pass of the wind\" at 470 metres) requires scrambling to reach the summit. Bengower\u2019s prominence of qualifies it as a Marilyn, and it also ranks it as the 86th-highest mountain in Ireland in the MountainViews Online Database, 100 Highest Irish Mountains, where the prominence threshold is 100 metres. ==Hill walking== Because of its positioning, the more straightforward routes to climb Bengower usually follow a 7-kilometre 3-4 hour horseshoe loop-walk with the neighbouring peaks of Benlettery and Benglenisky. Bengower is often climbed as part of the popular 16\u2013kilometre 8\u20139 hour Glencoaghan Horseshoe, considered one of Ireland's best hill-walks. Bengower is also climbed as part of the longer Owenglin Horseshoe, a 20\u2013kilometre 10\u201312 hour route around the Owenglin River taking in over twelve summits. ==Gallery== File:Benlettery, Bengower & Benbreen from Derryclare.jpg|Benlettery (left), Bengower, and Benbreen (right), viewed from south ridge Derryclare File:Bengower, Benbreen, Benbaun & Bencollaghduff from Derryclare.jpg|Bengower (left), Benbreen (centre), and Bencollaghduff (right), viewed Derryclare File:Bengower & Benbreen from summit of Bencollaghduff.jpg|Bengower (back left) behind Benbreen, viewed from Bencollaghduff File:Benlettery (left) and Benglenisky (right) from Bengower.jpg|Benlettery (left) and Benglenisky (right) from the summit of Bengower ==Bibliography== * * * * * ==See also== *Twelve Bens *Mweelrea, major range in Killary Harbour *Maumturks, major range in Connemara *Lists of mountains in Ireland *Lists of mountains and hills in the British Isles *List of Marilyns in the British Isles *List of Hewitt mountains in England, Wales and Ireland ==References== ==External links== *MountainViews: The Irish Mountain Website, Bengower *MountainViews: Irish Online Mountain Database *The Database of British and Irish Hills , the largest database of British Isles mountains (\"DoBIH\") *Hill Bagging UK & Ireland, the searchable interface for the DoBIH Category:Marilyns of Ireland Category:Hewitts of Ireland Category:Mountains and hills of County Galway Category:Geography of County Galway Category:Mountains under 1000 metres ",
