The wheel arrangement is effectively two 4-6-0 ten-wheeler locomotives operating back to back, with the boiler and cab suspended between the two swivelling power units. Each power unit has two pairs of leading wheels in a leading bogie, followed by three coupled pairs of driving wheels and no trailing wheels. A similar wheel arrangement exists for Mallet type locomotives, but is referred to as . On a Mallet locomotive, only the front engine unit swivels while the rear unit is rigid in relation to the main frame. ==Overview== This was a rare wheel arrangement for Garratt locomotives, with only seven locomotives built for two South American customers. * The first was for the metre-gauge Mogyana Railway of Brazil, with five examples built by Beyer, Peacock and Company in 1912 and 1914. * The other was two locomotives built for the 3-foot gauge Ferrocarril Pacifico de Colombia by Armstrong Whitworth in 1924. {| class=\"wikitable collapsible sortable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:100%;text- align:center\" |+4-6-0+0-6-4 Garratt production list \u2013 All manufacturers |- !Gauge !Railway !Works no. !Units !Year !Builder |- | |Ferrocarril Pacifico de Colombia |565-566 |2 |1924 |Armstrong Whitworth |- | |Mogyana Railway, Brazil |5529-5530 |2 |1912 |Beyer, Peacock |- | |Mogyana Railway, Brazil |5787-5789 |3 |1914 |Beyer, Peacock |- |} ==References== 6,4-6-0 66,4-6-0+0-6-4 ",
