There were hidden cameras at the venue and candid conversations and confessions got recorded. When Anirudh Chawla and Yusuf Shaikh saw the raw uncensored footage they decided to turn it in to a reality film. ==Critical reception== Times of india gave 1 out of 5 and said dialogues are 'poor' would be an understatement. Each character displays passion for spouting ridiculous mindless statements that make you cringe. ==References== ==External links== * *Sabki Bajegi Band on Facebook *Sabki Bajegi Band on Twitter Category:Indian films Category:2015 films Category:2010s Hindi-language films ",
