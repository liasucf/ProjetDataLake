He was the 9th daimy\u014d from the T\u014dd\u014d clan to ruled Tsu Domain in Ise and Iga Provinces. ==Biography== Takasato was born in 1746 as the son T\u014dd\u014d Takahora, a 7000-koku hatamoto, who was adopted to become the 5th daimyo of Hisai Domain, a subsidiary domain of Tsu Domain, in 1728, and subsequently the 8th daimy\u014d of Tsu Domain from 1735. In 1762, Takasato was made daimyo of Hisai. However, on the death of his father in 1770, he turned Hisai over to a younger son of T\u014dd\u014d Takatoyo, and took on the reign of Tsu Domain itself. The domain suffered from severe financial problems during his rule, and he attempted a series of reforms, including encouragement of new industries. However, his efforts at land reform and debt moratorium met with tremendous opposition, leading to extensive rioting in 1796. He also attempted to tax shrines and temples in his domain, which also caused a public uproar. Takasato died prematurely in 1806, and was followed by his brother T\u014dd\u014d Takasawa. ==External links== * T\u014dd\u014d family information Category:Daimyo Category:1746 births Category:1806 deaths ",
