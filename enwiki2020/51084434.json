Phoebe is the practical sister, interested in helping the family and refusing a marriage proposal as she does not feel the necessary affection for her suitor.

The other is the quiet, uneventful existence of a family at Ballarat, and the attempt made by one of the girls to earn her own living by beekeeping and poultry farming.\" They concluded \"Kirkham's Find is a thoroughly readable and interesting novel.\"\"New Novels\", The Australasian, 16 October 1897, p49 In The West Australian a reviewer noted that \"Mary Gaunt has built up an interesting and brightly-written story, full of Australian colour and with an abundance of incident with which to sustain the reader's attention.\"\"Kirkham's Find\", The West Australian, 24 November 1897, p9 ==See also== * Full text of the novel from Project Gutenberg AustraliaKirkham's Find by Mary Gaunt - full text * 1897 in Australian literature ==References== Category:Novels set in Victoria (Australia) Category:1897 Australian novels ",
