One incident included a terrorist attack on a Police Academy at Lahore in 2009.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1821700/ IMDb == Plot== Major Mujtaba Rizvi (played by Shaan Shahid) is a former Pakistan Army officer, who took an early retirement. The plot involves a counter-terrorism operation being conducted in the northwestern tribal region of Pakistan, led by Ehtesham Khattak (played by Hamza Ali Abbasi) and coordinated by his sister, Javeria Khattak (played by Ayesha Khan), an intelligence officer. Ehtesham and Javeria learn of a major terrorist attack that can only be countered with the help of Major Mujtaba. Major Mujtaba's family was assassinated by Ramal (played by Shamoon Abbasi), an agent in India's spy agency Research and Analysis Wing's (RAW) operation. Major Mujtaba wants to take revenge on Ramal. Recognizing Ramal through his actions and tactics, Major Mujtaba is able to counter his attacks. Mulla Siraj, a Taliban working with Ramal, is operating from a fort in the tribal area. He gives Ramal two bombs which Ramal is going to plant somewhere in Pakistan. Planned by Laxmi, a RAW spy; terrorists conduct an attack on a police training center to divert the attention of the security agencies. They have been watching any suspicious activity as they have learned that a major terrorist action is imminent. One bomb is loaded in a vehicle, which Ehtesham drives away in order to dispose the bomb. He is killed when the bomb explodes. The second bomb is planted in Jinnah Convention Centre, Islamabad but Major Mujtaba counters this attack and saves the country from another deadly terror incident.

According to the producer, Hassan Waqas Rana, it was considered dubbing the movie in Urdu but the idea was dropped as it would have compromised the lead role played by Shaan Shahid. The story highlights the aspect of terrorism in Pakistan. It was written by Hassan Waqas Rana. === Casting and crew === Initially, it was reported that Tom Delmar who has worked as stunt director in Hollywood movies would direct; later Lashari was chosen as the director who was working with Rana on another project. It is Bilal Lashari's debut as a director, who has directed music videos and assisted Shoaib Mansoor in the film Khuda Kay Liye. Ali Azmat and Meesha Shafi, who are known for singing, made their acting debut in the film. Originally Ali Azmat's and Ayesha Khan's roles were limited to guest appearance that were later expanded to full roles.

It took three years to complete Waar. Locations included Karachi (Pakistan), Rome (Italy), Istanbul (Turkey), Lahore (Pakistan), Islamabad, Swat Valley. It was reported in the media that the film was shot in collaboration with the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the media wing of Pakistan Army; director Bilal Lashari denied any such collaboration saying that the confusion might have arisen as MindWorks Media worked on the documentary The Glorious Resolve with ISPR when Waar was being filmed. The budget was variously said to be PKR: 170 million and PKR: 200 million. == Release and promotion == The release date was changed repeatedly and finally it was released on 16 October 2013 coinciding with Eid al-Adha in Pakistan. It was initially scheduled to release on 6 September 2013. The first theatrical trailer of the movie was launched in January 2012 while the second in January 2013. One of the trailers was viewed more than 500,000 times the same month, making it one of the top five videos of YouTube. Waar was dubbed as the most anticipated film in the history of the Pakistani cinema. When the film did not make it to screens in a considerable time after the release of trailers, the critics dubbed it as another project that will get shelved.

The film premiered on 10 October at Karachi and on 14 October 2013 at Rawalpindi/Islamabad.

Rafay Mahmood for The Express Tribune gave the movie three out of five stars and commended the cinematography, editing and sound design but viewed critically the story and some performances. According to the review, Waar is a \"piece of pointless propaganda (and) is going to further confuse an already puzzled nation about Pakistan's outlook on counter-terrorism. In the long run, it will prove to be a great feature for Pakistani cinema but a damaging one for intellect.\" Mohammad Kamran Jawaid of Dawn gave Waar a negative review, calling the screenplay a \"codswallop of instances taped together to form narrative coherency\". He also criticized the use of English, stating that \"catering to the international market is one thing, but relying solely on it is either ignorance or arrogance\". His review labels Waar as a \"'showy' enterprise\" where the \"story, the plot, the resolve \u2014 in fact everything \u2014 hangs on a failing thread\". Salman Khalid for Daily Times talks about the message given by the movie that highlights the \"Pakistani perspective on the menace of terrorism\", while acclaiming the story, direction, action sequences and individual performances. Rubban Shakeel of Skotato gave Waar 3.5/5 stars, calling it one of the best action films on Pakistan.
