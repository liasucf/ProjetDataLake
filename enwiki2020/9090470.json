Sicklauddsbron (Swedish: \"The Bridge of Cape Sickla\") or Apat\u00eabron (\"Bridge Apat\u00ea\") is a bridge in central Stockholm, Sweden. It stretches over Sickla kanal in S\u00f6dra Hammarbyhamnen. The name Sickla is believed to be derived from a 15th-century provincial word, sik, meaning \"minor marsh\". The bridge is named Apat\u00ea, a Greek word meaning mirage or illusion. Designed by the architects Magnus St\u00e5hl, Erik Andersson (architect), and Jelena Mijanovic, it was awarded the European Steel Design Award in 2003. Sicklauddsbron is a stainless steel pedestrian bridge, 62 metres in length. The load-bearing sections are made of 80 tonnes hot-rolled duplex stainless steel gauge plates, 25 mm thick, which were water cut, flanged, and welded before being reassembled on the site. From the concrete abutments tension cables stretches the central part of the bridge, an arched box girder triangular in section. The lighting is built-in into the stainless steel handrails, while the pathway is covered with asphalt. == See also == * List of bridges in Stockholm * Danviksbron * Sickla kanalbro == References == == External links == * steelconstruct.com - Bridge Apat\u00ea Brief description. * ljusdesign.com - Pedestrian bridge \"Apat\u00ea\" - Night view of the bridge. * - Erik Andersson Architects\" Category:Bridges in Stockholm Category:Pedestrian bridges in Sweden ",
