It was used as the title of a book about Solomon Islands by D.C. Horton (1966). The station's name was suggested by VSA volunteer training officer Hugh Young on his departure in 1976, but not adopted until a year or two later, by Station Manager Welshman Teilo. As a result, the \"Happy Isles\" was then widely adopted as a nickname for the whole country.
