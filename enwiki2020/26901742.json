    "text": "James Edward Goonan (9 February 1897 - 24 June 1988) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Carlton in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the 1920s. Goonan spent three seasons with Carlton's seniors without establishing a place in the team when in 1925 he was picked to captain-coach the seconds. A wingman, he immediately had an influence by steering the club to three successive premierships from 1926 to 1928. In 1927 he also played some games with the seniors. Originally from Brunswick, Goonan returned to the VFA in 1929 and captain-coached Preston for two seasons. ==References== Category:1897 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Carlton Football Club players Category:Preston Football Club (VFA) players Category:Northern Blues coaches Category:Brunswick Football Club players Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) ",
