    "text": "Constant Camber 26 is a cruising sloop trimaran sailboat designed in the 1970s by John Marples featuring berths for two adults and two children. The constant camber hull is constructed using a single master template to produce each panel, resulting in a design with unchanging curvature, imparting extraordinary strength similar to an eggshell. The panels are laminated using a vacuum bagging technique, as described in Marples' article, \"Backyard Vacuum Bagging,\" written for WoodenBoat Magazine. A unique and appealing feature, aside from its modular construction, is that her cross arms fold up and in, reducing her beam to just under , making this trimaran fully trailerable. ==See also== * List of multihulls ==References== Category:Trimarans ",
