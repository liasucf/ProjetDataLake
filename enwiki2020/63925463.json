The album peaked at number five in Spain. ==Background== The idea behind the album was to start a new path with their fifth album. Leave the first four as a unit and separate both blocks with the conceptual EP El Gatopardo they released in 2018. The objective was to make a contemporary record, they comment that \"it is our first contemporary pop album, it is an album in which we try to transmit our emotions reflected in the now, transformed and distorted by the technology we use to transmit them.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !
