Unlike her older siblings who were interested in engineering and physics, Senait demonstrated a passion for medicine from a very young age. After completing high school, Fisseha briefly studied at Tikur Anbessa (Black Lion Medical School) in Addis Ababa. In 1989, she traveled to the United States, enrolled at Rosary College (now Dominican University), and earned a Bachelor of Science degree. Subsequently, she received Howard Hughes Medical Institute funding to pursue research at the University of Michigan. While at the University of Michigan, Senait developed new interests in the field of medical malpractice, specifically in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology. This, combined with an interest in international women's health and women's rights, led to pursuit of a joint Juris Doctor (J.D.)/Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) program. Senait earned a J.D./M.D. degree from Southern Illinois University in 1999 with honors, and was inducted into the Alpha Omega Alpha honor society. She completed a residency in obstetrics and gynaecology in 2003, and a fellowship in reproductive endocrinology and infertility in 2006, at the University of Michigan medical center. == Career == Fisseha's work has centered on improving global women's health.

Fisseha led the creation of the Center for International Reproductive Health Training (CIRHT) at the University of Michigan and held the title of founding executive director of the center until 2015. The CIRHT was founded to serve as a collaboration platform for University of Michigan faculty and faculty from medical institutions in sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia where the reported maternal mortality rates are high. The goal of the center is to alleviate the burden of maternal mortality and to promote reproductive health and reproductive justice in these regions. Senate played a key role in founding the center and as a facilitator of the collaboration between her colleges at the University of Michigan and faculty at medical institutions in her native Ethiopia. Fisseha secured a $25 million grant to pilot the CIRHT program with St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College (SPHMMC) in Addis Ababa. As part of the partnership, a pre-service training module was developed for the physicians, nurses, and midwives. After the successful first implementations of the module in SPHMMC, it was adopted by nine other institutions in the country. Fisseha was appointed as the director of International Programs at the Buffett Foundation in 2015, where she oversees international grant making and continues to advocate for global reproductive justice. Fisseha chaired the campaign and transition of the director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the first African elected director-general of WHO.
