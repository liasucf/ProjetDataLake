He also imitated Usha Uthup and Saju still remembers the experience with Usha Didi. During one of their stage shows in Germany, Saju dressed up like Usha Didi and she suddenly met him who dressed up like her. She told him that the makeup was not correct and she herself gave her bindi, ornaments to Saju and set him as a real Usha Uthup. ==Filmography== *Onnaman *Thillana Thillana (2003) *Campus (2004) (Tamil film) *Vamanapuram Bus Route (2004) *Kanaka Simhasanam (2006) *Novel (2008) *Parunthu (2008) *Shudharil Shudhan (2009) *Pramukhan (2009) *Dr. Patient (2009) *Bharya Onnu Makkal Moonnu (2009) *Swantham Bharya Zindabad (2010) *Chekavar (2010) *NotOut (2011) *Lucky Jokers (2011) *Venicile Vyapari (2011) *101 Weddings (2012) *Sringaravelan (2013) as Narayanan Nair *Mylanchi Monchulla Veedu (2014) *Two Countries (2015) as Chellappan *Pushkaran *Welcome to Central Jail (2016) *Swarna Kaduva (2016) as Mollykutty's brother *Sherlock Toms (2017) * Aakasha Ganga 2 (2019) ==Writer== * Lucky Jokers ==External links== * * Category:Living people Category:Male actors from Kochi Category:Indian male film actors Category:Indian male television actors Category:Male actors in Malayalam television Category:People from Aluva Category:21st-century Indian male actors Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
