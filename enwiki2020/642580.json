    "text": "Axis of Justice is a non-profit organization co-founded by Serj Tankian and Tom Morello. Its purpose is to bring together musicians, fans of music, and grassroots progressivism to fight for social justice together. ==Formation== In a 2007 interview, Tom Morello remarked that he formed Axis of Justice with Serj Tankian after witnessing some members of the audience at Ozzfest 2002 promoting racist symbols and imagery. In an effort to promote an adamant anti- racist and anti-fascist message, Axis of Justice allied with Anti-Racist Action shortly after its formation. Axis of Justice tents appeared at music festivals where either Audioslave (now defunct) or System of a Down were playing, as it did at Lollapalooza 2003. The Axis of Justice also puts out a monthly radio show that can be heard on Pacifica Radio station KPFK (90.7 FM) in Los Angeles, California, and on XM Satellite Radio. The shows are archived in MP3 format on the AOJ website and are available as free downloads. They also have a number of books on their website that they recommend to support their views. In 2004, they released a live album/DVD entitled Axis of Justice: Concert Series Volume 1. It contains performances by Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers, Brad Wilk from Rage Against the Machine and Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Audioslave, Serj Tankian from System of a Down, Corey Taylor of Slipknot and Stone Sour, Pete Yorn, Tim Walker, Maynard James Keenan of Tool, A Perfect Circle and Puscifer, and Wayne Kramer among others. It was recorded during a concert at the Avalon in Los Angeles. The concert was a benefit to raise money for the Axis of Justice and a variety of causes. ==Members== *Serj Tankian \u2013 lead vocals, piano *Tom Morello \u2013 guitars, vocals ===Performers=== *Tim McIlrath \u2013 lead vocals *Flea \u2013 bass *Brad Wilk \u2013 drums *Pete Yorn \u2013 guitars, vocals *Tim Walker \u2013 guitars, pedal steel *Maynard James Keenan \u2013 vocals *Buckethead \u2013 Multi-instrumentalist *Slash \u2013 lead guitar *Jonny Polonsky \u2013 keyboards, bass *Chris Cornell \u2013 lead vocal *Taylor Hawkins - drums *Dave Grohl - drums, vocals, guitar *Trent Reznor - lead vocals *Krist Novoselic - bass *Dave Catching - guitar *Mike McCready - guitar *Mike Mills - bass *Billy Corgan - vocals, guitar *James Iha - guitar *Jeff Ament - bass *Josh Freese - drums *Duff Mckagan - bass, guitar, vocals *Perry Farrell - vocals *John Frusciante - guitar *Jerry Cantrell - guitar *Mike Inez - bass *Daron Malakian - guitar *Daniel Rey - guitar *Chad Smith - drums *Mike Watt - bass *Pat Smear - guitar *Jimmy Page - guitar *John Paul Jones - bass *Jeff Beck - guitar *Josh Homme -rhythm guitar *Stephen Perkins - drums *Corey Taylor \u2013 lead vocals *Simon Petty \u2013 guitars *Zack De La Rocha - lead vocal *Keith Levene - lead guitar *Scott Weiland - lead vocals *Malcolm Cross \u2013 drums, percussion, piano *Travis Barker \u2013 drums *Dez Cadena - guitar *Matt Sorum - drums *Gilby Clarke - guitar *Sean Kinney - drums *Stone Gossard - guitar *Kim Gordon - vocals *Lemmy Kilmister - vocals, bass *Kim Thayil - guitar *Alan White - drums *Matt Cameron - drums *Jimmy Chamberlin - drums *Ben Shepherd - bass *J Mascis - guitar *John Fogerty - guitar, vocals *Eddie Vedder - vocals *Dave Kushner - guitar *Art Karamian - guitar, vocals *David Hakopyan - bass guitar *Sammy J.
