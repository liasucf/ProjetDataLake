Creating a court that allowed Indians swift, inexpensive, and effective justice came after the failure of crown efforts to provide legal redress through Spanish courts and legal procedures. A monograph by historian Woodrow Borah examines the precedents for establishing the court, the procedures it adopted, and the financing legal aid to Indians through a tax of a half real.Woodrow Borah, Justice by Insurance: The General Indian Court of Colonial Mexico and the Legal Aides of the Half-Real. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press 1983. . Previous to the court\u2019s formal establishment, viceroys handled a good number of complaints by indigenous, a practice initiated by New Spain\u2019s first viceroy, Don Antonio de Mendoza.Arthur Aiton, \u2018\u2019Antonio de Mendoza\u2019\u2019. Durham: Duke University Press 1927. The court was established after the almost complete destruction of the indigenous populations in the Caribbean and the precipitous fall in those populations in Central Mexico during the sixteenth century. Similar processes were at work in Peru and Viceroy Francisco de Toledo established the Juzgado General de Indios del Peru, which set the precedent for the Indian court in Mexico.Woodrow Borah, \"Juzgado General de indios del Per\u00fa o juzgado particular de indios de El Cercado de Lima.\" Revista Chilena de Historia del Derecho, no. 6 (1970): 129-142.Borah, The General Indian Court, p. 84. Spanish officials came to recognize that the access of indigenous individuals and communities to courts for summary judgments at low cost and without the possibility of extended litigation would benefit them. The legal theory underpinning the establishment of the court was that the crown had the duty to protect miserables, such as widows and orphans, and the classification was extended to the indigenous peoples. The crown had already established a legal division between the Indians and the non-Indian populations broadly conceived (Spaniards, Africans, and mixed-race castas) with the Rep\u00fablica de Indios and the Rep\u00fablica de Espa\u00f1oles. Although with the establishment of the Holy Office of the Inquisition in 1571, indigenous were deemed perpetual neophytes and excluded from its jurisdiction, but the establishment of the General Indian Court under Viceroy Luis Velasco II, indigenous, particularly in Central Mexico, had standing in the legal system. With the help of legal aides funded by a half- real tax, indigenous could pursue legal redress through the courts. Vested Spanish interests opposed the establishment of the court, since their practices could be blocked by complaints by indigenous about exploitation. ==References== ==Further reading== *Avalos, F., 1991. \"The Legal Personality of the Colonial Period of Mexico.\" Law.
