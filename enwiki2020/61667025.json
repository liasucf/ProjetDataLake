    "text": "The Linares Baeza\u2013Almer\u00eda railway is an Iberian-gauge railway line in Spain. It branches from the Alc\u00e1zar de San Juan\u2013C\u00e1diz railway at Linares and terminates in Almer\u00eda. It is currently the main line linking Madrid to Almer\u00eda. ==Route== The line runs through the provinces of Ja\u00e9n, Granada and Almer\u00eda. The route formerly contained the Hacho Bridge, which was the longest iron viaduct on the Spanish rail network.Ch\u00edas Navarro, Prop and Abbot Balboa, Tom\u00e1s: \" Bridges of Spain \", FCC, Madrid 1994, pag. 248, ==Services== The line is used by all trains from Almer\u00eda to Madrid, with the full journey taking around six hours. To continue to Madrid from Linares, the line uses the Alc\u00e1zar de San Juan\u2013C\u00e1diz railway as far as Alc\u00e1zar de San Juan, and the Madrid\u2013Valencia railway to Madrid Chamart\u00edn. ==Future== In 2023, Almer\u00eda railway station will be linked to the AVE high-speed rail network by the Murcia\u2013Almer\u00eda high-speed rail line, allowing a 3.5 hour journey to Madrid, compared to over six hours using the Linares Baeza\u2013Almer\u00eda railway, which will therefore decrease in importance. ==References== Category:Railway lines in Spain Category:Iberian gauge railways ",
