    "text": "The People's Liberation Army has not always used ranks or insignia. In common with the practice of the Red Army at the time of its founding in 1927, neither were used until 1955 when a system of ranks was established. As a result of the Cultural Revolution, ranks were abolished in May 1965. After the Sino- Vietnamese War of 1979, reforms in the PLA began to be made to professionalize the armed forces once more. The 1984 Military Service Law provided for the resumption of rank, but disagreements on what ranks were to be used and who would receive them caused the revival of rank to be delayed until 1988. The following ranks and their respective insignia shown are those used by the People's Liberation Army Ground Force. == Current ranking system == === PLAGF officers === The current system of officer ranks and insignia, a revision of the ranks and insignia established in 1955, began use in 1988. The 1955\u20131965 marshal officer ranks of Yu\u00e1nshu\u00e0i (5-star Marshal) and D\u00e0 Yu\u00e1nshu\u00e0i (6-star Grand Marshal) were not revived. The general officer ranks (Jiang) were revised by the addition of semi-circular wreath at the bottom of the insignia and by a change in the name of the highest general officer rank from Da Jiang (4-star General) to Yi Ji Shang Jiang (4-star First Class Colonel General). This highest rank in the new system was never held and was abolished in 1994. The field officer (Xiao) and company officer (Wei) ranks were the same in title and insignia except that highest company-level officer rank of Da Wei in the 1955\u20131965 system was not included in the revived ranks. The final difference between the two systems is that in 1955\u20131965 there existed a warrant officer rank, Zhun Wei, which was not incorporated in the revived rank system, while new system had a rank for officer cadets, Xue Yuan. Despite being the rank below Shao Wei in both systems, the insignia have no similarities. Officer rank names are usually not translated literally, but rather to a corresponding rank system. This can lead to different translations being used depending on the system chosen for the correspondences. The 1955\u20131965 system, with its greater number of officer ranks, is usually translated using the Soviet rank system of that era, while the modern officer ranks are usually given a NATO rank correspondence. For example, the non- literal translation used for the rank of Shang Jiang (literally: Senior General) depends on whether one is comparing it to Soviet or Russian ranks (colonel general) or to British or U.S. ranks (General). {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\" class=\"wikitable\" |-style=\"text- align:center;\" !Title !\u5b66\u5458 Xue yuan !\u5c11\u5c09 Shao wei !\u4e2d\u5c09 Zhong wei !\u4e0a\u5c09 Shang wei !\u5c11\u6821 Shao xiao !\u4e2d\u6821 Zhong xiao !\u4e0a\u6821 Shang xiao !\u5927\u6821 Da xiao !\u5c11\u5c06 Shao jiang !\u4e2d\u5c06 Zhong jiang !\u4e0a\u5c06 Shang jiang |-style=\"text-align:center;\" !Usual Translation !Officer cadet (OF-D) !2nd Lieutenant (OF-1) !1st Lieutenant (OF-1) !Captain (OF-2) !Major (OF-3) !Lieutenant colonel (OF-4) !Colonel (OF-5) !Senior Colonel (OF-6) !Major General (OF-7) !Lieutenant General (OF-8) !Colonel general or general (OF-9) |-style=\"text-align:center;\" !Shoulder Insignia | align=\"center\" width=\"5%\" | 60px | align=\"center\" width=\"9%\" | 60px | align=\"center\" width=\"9%\" | 60px | align=\"center\" width=\"9%\" | 60px | align=\"center\" width=\"9%\" | 60px | align=\"center\" width=\"9%\" | 60px | align=\"center\" width=\"9%\" | 60px | align=\"center\" width=\"9%\" | 60px | align=\"center\" width=\"9%\" | 60px | align=\"center\" width=\"9%\" | 60px | align=\"center\" width=\"9%\" | 60px |-style=\"text-align:center;\" !Collar Insignia | align=\"center\" width=\"5%\" | 70px | align=\"center\" width=\"9%\" | 70px | align=\"center\" width=\"9%\" | 70px | align=\"center\" width=\"9%\" | 70px | align=\"center\" width=\"9%\" | 70px | align=\"center\" width=\"9%\" | 70px | align=\"center\" width=\"9%\" | 70px | align=\"center\" width=\"9%\" | 70px | align=\"center\" width=\"9%\" | 70px | align=\"center\" width=\"9%\" | 70px | align=\"center\" width=\"9%\" | 70px |} === PLAGF other ranks personnel === The current system of other ranks and insignia dates from 2009.\u5168\u519b\u548c\u6b66\u8b66\u90e8\u961f\u5e74\u5e95\u524d\u5c06\u5168\u9762\u65bd\u884c\u65b0\u7684\u58eb\u5b98\u5236\u5ea6 {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\" class=\"wikitable\" |-style=\"text-align:center;\" !Title !\u5217\u5175 Lie bing !\u4e0a\u7b49\u5175 Shang deng bing !\u4e0b\u58eb Xia shi !\u4e2d\u58eb Zhong shi !\u4e0a\u58eb Shang shi !\u56db\u7ea7\u519b\u58eb\u957f Si ji jun shi zhang !\u4e09\u7ea7\u519b\u58eb\u957f San ji jun shi zhang !\u4e8c\u7ea7\u519b\u58eb\u957f Er ji jun shi zhang !\u4e00\u7ea7\u519b\u58eb\u957f Yi ji jun shi zhang |-style=\"text-align:center;\" !Usual Translation !Private 2nd Class (OR-1) !Private 1st Class (OR-2) !Corporal (OR-3) !Sergeant (OR-4) !Staff Sergeant (OR-5) !

Ranks of the People's Liberation Army Navy also have corresponding insignia with a black background, but are only worn with the dress white uniforms, as only sleeve insignia are used in the dress blue uniform for officers, with other ranks retaining the shoulder board insignia. == 1955\u201365 ranking system == The insignia used by officers in the period 1955\u20131965 by the PLA Ground Force were similar in style to those used by the Soviet Army at the time, with the primary differences being the existence of an additional field officer rank, and the insignia of the highest general officer rank being four stars unlike the one large star used starting 1963. The NCO insignia of that period showed Japanese influence with the use of stars on the collars with the specialty badge on the side. While general duties officers wore the shoulder board pattern shown below (gold and red), technical service officers sported white and red shoulder boards with their rank insignia. === Officers === {| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font- size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px; width: 100%\" |- style=\"text- align:center;\" !rowspan=3| China | colspan=1| \u5927\u5143\u5e05 | colspan=1| \u5143\u5e05 | colspan=1| \u5927\u5c06 | colspan=1| \u4e0a\u5c06 | colspan=2| \u4e2d\u6821 | colspan=2| \u5c11\u6821 | colspan=2| \u5927\u6821 | colspan=2| \u4e0a\u6821 | colspan=2| \u4e2d\u6821 | colspan=2| \u5c11\u6821 | colspan=2| \u5927\u5c09 | colspan=2| \u4e0a\u5c09 | colspan=2| \u4e2d\u5c09 | colspan=2| \u5c11\u5c09 | colspan=12| \u51c6\u5c09 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | colspan=1| 100px | colspan=1| 100px | colspan=1| 100px | colspan=1| 100px | colspan=2| 100px | colspan=2| 100px | colspan=2| 100px | colspan=2| 100px | colspan=2| 100px | colspan=2| 100px | colspan=2| 100px | colspan=2| 100px | colspan=2| 100px | colspan=2| 100px | colspan=12| 100px |- style=\"text- align:center;\" | colspan=1| Generalissimo of the PRC | colspan=1| Marshal of the PRC | colspan=1| General of the Army \u5927\u5c06 | colspan=1| Colonel General \u4e0a\u5c06 | colspan=2| Lieutenant General \u4e2d\u5c06 | colspan=2| Major General \u5c11\u5c06 | colspan=2| Colonel Commandant \u5927\u6821 | colspan=2| Colonel \u4e0a\u6821 | colspan=2| Lieutenant colonel \u4e2d\u6821 | colspan=2| Major \u5c11\u6821 | colspan=2| Captain \u5927\u5c09 | colspan=2| Senior Lieutenant \u4e0a\u5c09 | colspan=2| 1st Lieutenant \u4e2d\u5c09 | colspan=2| 2nd Lieutenant \u5c11\u5c09 | colspan=12| Warrant Officer \u51c6\u5c09 |} === Enlisted personnel === {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !|Rank category !|Rank !|Shoulder board insignia !|Collar insignia |- !rowspan=3|NCOs |Staff Sergeant !rowspan=5|No shoulder insignia |100px |- |Sergeant |100px |- |Corporal |100px |- !rowspan=2|Privates |Private First Class |100px |- |Private Second Class |100px |} == See also == * Republic of China Army rank insignia ==References== ==External links== *PLA Uniforms and Insignia *Military ranks of the People's Liberation Army, on pre-2007 uniforms Category:People's Liberation Army Category:Military ranks of the People's Republic of China People's Liberation Army ",
