Later it was mentioned in a document issued by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Opolski on June 24, 1257, which allowed Henryk of Miech\u00f3w to resettle Chorz\u00f3w on German law. This privilege was renewed by Casimir of Bytom in 1299. The local Catholic parish was established somewhere between 1300 and 1326, when it was first mentioned in Peter's Pence register among parishes of S\u0142awk\u00f3w deanery in Diocese of Krak\u00f3w. After World War I in the Upper Silesia plebiscite 3,242 out of 6,269 voters in Chorz\u00f3w (Stary) voted in favour of staying in Germany, against 2,980 opting for joining Poland. In 1922 it became a part of Silesian Voivodeship, Second Polish Republic. ==References== Category:Chorz\u00f3w Category:Neighbourhoods in Silesian Voivodeship ",
