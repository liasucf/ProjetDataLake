    "text": "Hangsaman is a 1951 gothic novel by American author Shirley Jackson. The second of Jackson's published novels, Hangsaman is a bildungsroman centering on lonely college freshman Natalie Waite, who descends into madness after enrolling in a liberal arts college. The novel takes its title from an old folk ballad. The official publisher's description of Hangsaman says the novel is \u201cloosely based on the real-life disappearance of a Bennington College sophomore in 1946,\" referencing the case of Paula Jean Welden. At the time, Jackson was living in Bennington, Vermont, as her husband, Stanley Edgar Hyman, was employed at Bennington College, where Welden had been a student. However, Ruth Franklin's research for her 2016 biography of Jackson found no evidence the novel was inspired by Welden's disappearance. Jackson's text mixes satire with psychological elements as her protagonist spends half her time in an imaginary world. == Plot summary == On the verge of leaving for college, Natalie Waite feels oppressed by the expectations of her pompous, overbearing father, who imposes his personality on her, and by her miserable, defeated mother, who Natalie sees as an example of the unhappy future that awaits her if she does not escape from home. Natalie withdraws into elaborate fantasies where she is a proud, unbreakable criminal being grilled by a detective for her crimes. On the eve of Natalie's departure for college, she is invited to her first adult party, where she witnesses her parents and their drunken colleagues at their most contemptible. Natalie experiments with different identities among the party-goers and seems to successfully intrigue an older man, only to be led by him into the woods behind the family's home where he sexually assaults her. The following morning, Natalie convinces herself that the assault did not happen. Natalie leaves for her all-female college, where she is determined to reinvent herself. Most of her fellow students are too superficial and self-absorbed to even notice Natalie, who finds an uncomfortable place at the fringe of a group of popular girls, while her self-important professors and their resentful wives are not much different from her own parents. She resumes her fantasy life, imagining herself as an implacable giant that destroys the college and devours its residents. Natalie hears rumors of an impish student named Tony who is both scorned and secretly admired for her lack of conventionality. Natalie is determined to find and befriend Tony, but Tony seeks her out first. Natalie becomes totally absorbed with Tony, and together they embark on a series of eccentric adventures where they revel in their difference from and superiority to those around them. Natalie's reputation suffers due to her strange new behavior, but for the first time in her life, she no longer cares how others perceive her, even as Tony begins to lure her into increasingly dangerous situations. Finally, on a stormy night, Tony persuades Natalie to take a bus to an unfamiliar location miles from the college. With only Tony to guide her, Natalie follows her onto a bridge. Natalie realizes that Tony intends to jump from the bridge and that she expects Natalie to join her. Natalie is on the verge of jumping when Tony abruptly vanishes, revealing herself to have been another of Natalie's fantasies all along. Shaken by how close she came to suicide, but with renewed courage, Natalie begins to make her way back toward the college. == References in other media == The 2020 film Shirley is a fictionalized account of the time in which Jackson was writing Hangsaman, depicting the novel's creation as being inspired both by the Welden disappearance and the life of a boarder in the home of Jackson and her husband Stanley Hyman. ==References== Category:1951 American novels Category:American bildungsromans Category:Novels by Shirley Jackson Category:Books by Shirley Jackson ",
