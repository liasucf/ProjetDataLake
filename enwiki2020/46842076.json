    "text": "Nicolae Ghica-Bude\u0219ti (December 22, 1869 \u2013 December 16, 1943) was an influential Romanian architect who helped define the Neo-Romanian style. He studied ancient monuments in Wallachia, writing four volumes documenting the architectural history of the region. The \"Muntenia and Oltenia evolution in architecture\" was based on his work. His masterpiece is the Museum of the Romanian Peasant which took more than two decades to complete. ==Biography== Ghica-Bude\u0219ti was born in Ia\u0219i to Eugen N. Ghika-Bude\u0219ti and his wife Elena Cantacuzino-M\u0103gureanu. He attended the Coll\u00e8ge Gaillard of Lausanne, Switzerland and the \u00c9cole Monge in Paris. Then, he returned and studied architecture at the School of Bridges and Roads in Bucharest from 1889 to 1893 under Anghel Saligny. He returned to Paris to study at the \u00c9cole des Beaux- Arts with Victor Alexandre Frederic Laloux and earned his degree in 1901. That same year, he married Madeleine Landrieu (1869\u20131951) in Paris. They would have two children: Ion Ghica-Bude\u015fti and geologist \u015etefan Ghica-Bude\u015fti. He returned to Romania in 1905 and until 1906, he was the lead architect for the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Public Education. In 1906, he became the chief architect and technical consultant for the Historical Monuments Commission, holding the position until his death in 1943. He headed the restoration work for many medieval monuments during his tenure. He also became a professor at the National School of Architecture starting in 1910 and continuing through 1938. In 1937, Membrii Academiei Rom\u00e2ne din 1866 p\u00e2n\u0103 \u00een prezent at the Romanian Academy site Ghica-Bude\u015fti was made an honorary member of the Romanian Academy and served as President of the Romanian Architects Society from 1932 to 1935. In the period between the wars, there was a push to preserve Romanian culture. Nicolae Iorga, historian and politician, was particularly concerned that modernity would sweep away the past. He began to document and research historic monuments and paved the way for a comprehensive study of the monasteries and churches of the country. This massive study was carried out by George Bal\u0219, who documented Moldavian sites and Ghica-Bude\u015fti, who wrote four volumes of historiography of architecture after an in-depth study of properties in Muntenia and Oltenia, Wallachia. The \"Muntenia and Oltenia evolution in architecture\" was based primarily on his studies and writing. He was considered one of the leading experts of his time, along with Ion Mincu and Petre Antonescu. His work was considered eclectic, but he developed a composite Neo-Romanian style, utilizing brick and stone carvings which incorporated medieval Moldovan architectural details and Wallachian elements. Ghika-Budesti's style is \"unmistakable\", utilizing horseshoe arches, Gothic windows and door frames, glazed ceramic tiles, in green shades offsetting the red brick and neutral stone. Often there are towers and geometrical motifs featuring sawtooth quoins. He designed and constructed the Muzeul Na\u021bional al \u021a\u0103ranului Rom\u00e2n (Romanian National Peasant Museum) between 1912 and 1939, added a new wing to the University of Bucharest in a collaboration with A. Baucher between 1928 and 1930, built Cu\u0163itul de Argint Church, Saint Basil the Great Cathedral at No. 50 Polon\u0103 Street, the Radu Rosetti House at No. 3-5 Mihail Moxa Street, and the Pasteur Institute of Serum and Vaccines, all located in Bucharest. He also designed and built the in Ia\u0219i, the high school at R\u00e2mnicu V\u00e2lcea (now Alexandru Lahovary National College), and Vasile Alecsandri's Mausoleum in Mirce\u015fti. In 1914, he built a mansion for George \u0218tirbey in D\u0103rm\u0103ne\u0219ti surrounded by the Mun\u021bii Ciucului (Ciuc Mountains). The building is distinguished by its architectural massiveness. Red brick and simple stone decorations in a silhouette reminiscent of bell towers lend the structure the appearance of a monastery. Partially plastered fa\u00e7ades and masonry hold decorative wooden fachwerk balconies. The main structure has two floors and a single-story L wing. The most stunning elements are the hardwood staircase, a massive stone fireplace, and the open terrace overlooking the Mun\u021bii Nemira (Nemira Mountains). The planning for the in Ia\u0219i was begun in February 1934 with the establishment of a building committee and selection of Ghica-Bude\u0219ti as architect. Various disputes over location delayed the onset of building until 1937 and the uncertainty leading up to World War II caused several work stoppages, but the building managed to secure financing in 1939 with the help of Nicolae Iorga. Ghica-Bude\u0219ti died in 1943 in Bucharest. ==Written works== *M\u00e2n\u0103stirea Probota (cu G.
