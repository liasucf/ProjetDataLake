    "text": "Legends of Wrestling II is a professional wrestling video game developed by Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City, published by Acclaim Entertainment, and released on November 26, 2002 for both the PlayStation 2 and GameCube. It was later released for the Xbox on December 5, 2002. It is the sequel to the 2001 professional wrestling video game Legends of Wrestling. Legends II contains 25 wrestlers that were not in the first game, though also excludes Rob Van Dam, presumably because he had recently been signed to a WWE contract. The game did contain Eddie Guerrero, however, who, although unemployed at the time, re- signed with WWE when the game was released. The game was also released on the Game Boy Advance on November 25, 2002. It was the last game developed by Acclaim's Salt Lake City studio before its closure in December 2002. A sequel, Showdown: Legends of Wrestling, was released in 2004. The PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions included video interviews with many of the legends featured in the game while the European version of the game included four exclusive additional legends from the United Kingdom: Kendo Nagasaki, Big Daddy, Mick McManus, and Giant Haystacks. ==Gameplay== Within Career Mode, a wrestler will be working for a specific promoter in each area. By winning the belt for that division and successfully defending it, said promoter will become available for purchase in Shop Mode. Note that the world region is only available after completion of all the American territories. Each territory has between 8-12 storylines chosen at random with a push of a button. Certain storylines may not be available based on the wrestler used by the player. For example, if the player uses Jerry Lawler, the only storyline he can play in the Southeast region is based on the famous feud Lawler had with comedian Andy Kaufman. The game also features a Create A Legend mode (CAL). Players can create their own custom made characters which can be used for storyline mode as well as exhibition play. ==Reception== The console versions of the game received mixed reviews, while the Game Boy Advance version was critically panned. Metacritic gave it a score of 62 out of 100 for the Xbox version; 59 out of 100 for both the PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions; and 24 out of 100 for the Game Boy Advance version. ==See also== * List of licensed wrestling video games * List of fighting games * Legends of Wrestling (series) * Legends of Wrestling * Showdown: Legends of Wrestling ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2002 video games Category:Acclaim Entertainment games Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:GameCube games Category:Legends of Wrestling (series) Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games with custom soundtrack support Category:Xbox games Category:Professional wrestling games Category:Video games based on real people Category:Cultural depictions of professional wrestlers ",
