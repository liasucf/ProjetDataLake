Contestants are students from secondary schools, junior colleges and institutes of technical education. The second season began airing on MediaCorp Channel U on 28 May 2007 and ended on 25 August 2007. This is the only season of Campus SuperStar where the grand finals were held on Saturday instead of a traditional Sunday. Li Feihui was the only judge from the previous season to return, and was joined by Jim Lim and Jimmy Ye, who all appeared as judges for the first time. Previous judges Foong Wai See and Cavin Soh did not return, though Soh would later appear as a guest judge in season 3. Dasmond Koh and Pornsak hosted the show. This is the last season of Campus SuperStar to use male and female categories and have 20 finalists, before reducing to 12 acts and the removal of categories on the following season, which aired in 2009. The male category winner, Shawn Tok, from Loyang Secondary School, was declared the winner of the season, beating the female category winner Keely Wee from Victoria Junior College. Tok received a two- year MediaCorp management contract and a cash prize of $2,000. ==Judges and hosts== Li Feihui was confirmed to be returning to the judging panel after judging season one of the show. Season one judges Foong Wai See and Cavin Soh did not return as a judge for the second season. It was announced that two new judges would be brought in to replace both Foong and Soh on the judging panel. Jim Lim and Jimmy Ye were instated as the second and third judge. Jimmy Ye was also brought in as the vocal coach for the contestants. Season one host Dasmond Koh returned to host the show. Former season one hosts Hong Junyang and Sugianto left the show and their position was taken over by Pornsak. ==Selection process== ===Applications and first auditions=== The audition was opened to students from all secondary schools, junior colleges or institutes of technical education in Singapore. The episode of the auditions was broadcast on 28 May 2007 and was hosted by Fiona Xie. Auditions in front of the judges for season 2 took place at Toa Payoh HDB Hub. Applicants are to report to the venue for the audition in their respective school uniforms. There were approximately 4,500 students applied to take part in the first auditions. The auditions were originally scheduled on 16 March 2007 for the auditionees from the male category and 17 March 2007 for the auditionees from the female category. However, due to overwhelming response, the first auditions were extended for another four days til 19 March 2007. At the end of the first auditions, 100 males and 200 females were put through to the next round of auditions. ===Second auditions=== The second auditions took place on 31 March 2007 at MediaCorp. The second auditions were held closed-door and there were five judges judging the contestants. At the end of the auditions, 65 contestants were put through to the third and final round of the auditions. ===Third auditions=== The third and final round of auditions were held on 14 April 2007, once again at Toa Payoh HDB Hub. 24 contestants from the male category and 41 contestants from the female category took part in the auditions. At the end of the third auditions, the judges would select 10 contestants each from both categories to form the final 20.
