He originally sought to stick to his religious life, and had no desires to become sh\u014dgun. However, by 1464, he was convinced to join his brother, the sh\u014dgun, and assist him, putting himself into a position to be the next in the line of succession. The birth of the Sh\u014dgun's son placed Yoshimi in an awkward situation, making his succession no longer definite, but he remained as Yoshimasa's Deputy. Despite Yoshimi's support by Hosokawa, it was Hosokawa's opponent, Yamana S\u014dzen, who stayed in Yoshimi's mansion for a time, and who attended a ceremony in March 1467 honoring the sh\u014dgun and his brother. Hosokawa did not attend, as he was preparing for the imminent war between himself and Yamana, who supported the succession of the sh\u014dgun's infant son Ashikaga Yoshihisa. Following the initial battles between Hosokawa and Yamana within the capital (Kyoto), the \u014cnin War turned into a war between Yoshimi and his brother the Sh\u014dgun. Through a set of complicated events, Yoshimi became one of Yamana's chief generals, and was declared a \"rebel\" by the Emperor, and stripped of his court rank. That same year, 1469, the sh\u014dgun officially named his son heir. Yamana and Hosokawa both died soon afterwards, in 1473, and the \u014cnin War came to an end in 1477, along with Yoshimi's political aspirations. ==References== Category:Samurai Category:Japanese Buddhist monks Yoshimi Category:1439 births Category:1491 deaths ",
