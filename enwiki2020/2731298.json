    "text": "Lecointe Island is an elongated island, long between Cape Kaiser and Hvarchil Point, wide and high, separated from the east coast of Brabant Island by Pampa Passage, in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. The island was first roughly surveyed by the Belgian Antarctic Expedition, 1897\u201399, which gave the name Cape Kaiser to its northern extremity. The island was surveyed and photographed by several British expeditions, 1955\u201358, and was named by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey for Georges Lecointe, second-in-command and surveyor of the Belgian expedition which was responsible for the first survey of Gerlache Strait. It is also known as Isla Kaiser and Isla Alice. Brabant Island from northeast, with Anvers Island (on the right) and Antarctic Peninsula in the background; Lecointe Island is the larger of the two islands just left of Brabant. ==Maps== * Antarctic Digital Database (ADD).
