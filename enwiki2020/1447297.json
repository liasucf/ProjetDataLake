    "text": "Rodney Maxwell Davis (April 7, 1942 - September 6, 1967) was a non- commissioned officer in the United States Marine Corps who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for heroism above and beyond the call of duty in 1967, during the Vietnam War. Davis joined the Marine Corps in 1961, and was ordered to the Republic of Vietnam in 1967. In September 1967, during a search and destroy exercise as part of Operation Swift, Davis's company was attacked by enemies. When Davis's platoon retreated into a trench, Davis ran up and down his company's line and encouraged the men to fight, returning fire at the same time. When an enemy grenade came close to several men, Davis jumped on the grenade, saving his men's lives. ==Biography== Davis was born on April 7, 1942, in Macon, Georgia, to Gordon N. Davis and Ruth A. Davis. He attended elementary school and high school there and graduated from Peter G. Appling High School, May 29, 1961. Shortly after graduation, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in his hometown, August 31, 1961; then reported for recruit training with the First Recruit Training Battalion Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina. Upon completion of recruit training in December 1961, he was transferred to the Marine Corps Base, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and underwent Individual Combat Training with the Second Battalion, First Infantry Training Regiment, graduating the following February. He then joined Company K, 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines, 2nd Marine Division, FMF, at Camp Lejeune and served as a rifleman until May 1964. While stationed at Camp Lejeune, he was promoted to private first class, April 1, 1962, and to lance corporal, January 1, 1964. As a lance corporal, Davis was ordered to London, England, for a three-year tour of duty as Guard with the United States Marine Detachment, Naval Activities. He was promoted to corporal on January 1, 1966, and to sergeant on December 1, 1966. Ordered to the Republic of Vietnam in August 1967, he was assigned duty as a Platoon Guide with Company B, First Battalion, Fifth Marines, First Marine Division. On September 6, 1967, he was operating with his unit in the Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province on a search and clear mission during Operation Swift, when they were attacked by a large North Vietnamese force. Elements of the platoon were pinned down in a trench line by mortars, heavy automatic and small arms fire. He went from man to man encouraging them on and also returning fire at the same time. An enemy hand grenade fell in the trenches his men were fighting from and without hesitation he threw himself upon the grenade. He saved his fellow Marines in this selfless act and thus earned the nation's highest military decoration: the Medal of Honor. Presentation of the medal was made posthumously to his widow, Mrs. Judy P. Davis, by Vice President Spiro T. Agnew in his office. The presentation is \"in the name of the Congress of the United States.\" Davis was survived by his wife, Judy P. Davis and two daughters Nichola Davis and Samantha J. Davis-Steen. ==After death== The City of Macon did not allow black decedents to be buried inside the city limits in 1967. He was buried in an all black cemetery outside the city. About 2010, several marines (who were white) were driving by Macon, including 1 who was saved by Rodney. They stopped to pay their respects at his grave site and were angered to find that the wooden monument to Rodney was rotting and the cemetery was covered in weeds and had many head stones falling over. They removed all the weeds around Rodney's grave and many graves around it and cleaned up a section of the cemetery before leaving. The 1st Battalion, 5th Marines Association was informed and donations arranged. Civilians (white as well as black alike) and other marines, families and surviving spouses accumulated over $60,000 and a large, granite monument was built at Rodney's grave site. Several times a year, a gathering is organized and the entire cemetery is weeded and taken care of. Donations continue to be accumulated and are now used mainly for scholarships of deserving children. ==Military awards== Davis' decorations and awards include: {| |- | | | |- |- | | || |- | | | |- | | | |} {| class=\"wikitable\" | |Medal of Honor | |- |Purple Heart Medal |Combat Action Ribbon |Navy Presidential Unit Citation |- |Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal w/ one \" bronze star |National Defense Service Medal |Vietnam Service Medal w/ one \" bronze star |- |Republic of Vietnam Military Merit Medal |Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross w/ palm |Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal w/ 1960- device |} == Medal of Honor citation== The President of the United States in the name of The Congress takes pride in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR posthumously to SERGEANT RODNEY M.
