The fruit is a drupe roughly 2 to 3 centimeters long with a black husk and a seed, which is an edible walnut meat, inside.USFWS. Determination of endangered status for Juglans jamaicensis. Federal Register 13 January 1997. In Puerto Rico there are only ten to fourteen trees of this species remaining. It is also rare in Cuba and Hispaniola. It is threatened by habitat loss.

The attractive wood is similar to that of the black walnut (Juglans nigra).Francis, J. K. and S. Alemany. (1994). Juglans jamaicensis C. DC.
