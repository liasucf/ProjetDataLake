Several proposals have suggested extending this line to the Jerusalem city center and from there possibly to the Western Wall in the Old City.https://www.yediot.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4912365,00.html Initial plans called for a central Jerusalem station at the intersection of King George and Jaffa streets, under the \"Pillars Building\" (which from 1932 until the 1960s served as Jerusalem's central bus station) and its parking lot. This location would provide transfers to the Red Line and future Blue Line of the Jerusalem Light Rail. The station would be location 50m underground. In July 2018 it was reported that a second location had been proposed, at the future \"Begin Compound\" to be built adjacent to the Davidka Square. Israel Railways submitted a legal objection asking that the compound's plan be modified to allow for an underground train station.http://mynetjerusalem.co.il/article/303798/5 Since this location is at a higher elevation than the Pillars Building, the station would be deeper, 75m below ground level. ==References== Category:Proposed railway stations in Israel Category:Railway stations in Jerusalem Category:Railway stations located underground ",
