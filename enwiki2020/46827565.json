    "text": "Nas\u012bb () is an Arabic literary form, 'usually defined as an erotic or amatory prelude to the type of long poem called a qa\u1e63\u012bdah.'T. M. Johnstone, 'Nas\u012bb and Mans\u00f6ngur', The Journal of Arabic Literature, 3 (1972), 90-95 (p. 90). However, although at the beginning of the form's development nas\u012bb meant 'love-song', it came to cover much wider kinds of content:T. M. Johnstone, 'Nas\u012bb and Mans\u00f6ngur', The Journal of Arabic Literature, 3 (1972), 90-95 (p. 93). 'The nas\u012bb usually is understood as the first part of the qa\u1e63\u012bdah where the poet remembers his beloved. In later ages the nas\u012bb stood alone, and in that sense the meaning came to be understood as erotic and love poetry.'Wahab Alansari, An Anthology of Arabic Poetry, rev. edn (Seattle: Academy of Languages, 2010), p. 16. Early and prominent examples of the nas\u012bb appear in the Mu'allaq\u0101t of the sixth-century poets Antarah ibn Shaddad and Imru' al- Qais. To quote from Imru' al-Qais's Mu'allaqah: > Stay! let us weep, while memory tries to trace > The long-lost fair one's sand-girt dwelling place; > Though the rude winds have swept the sandy plain, > Still some faint traces of that spot remain. > My comrades reined their coursers by my side, > And \"Yield not, yield not to despair\" they cried. > (Tears were my sole reply; yet what avail > Tears shed on sands, or sighs upon the gale?)T. M. Johnstone, 'Nas\u012bb and > Mans\u00f6ngur', The Journal of Arabic Literature, 3 (1972), 90-95 (p. 92), > quoting W. A. Clouston, Arabian Poetry for English Readers (Glasgow: [n. > pub.], 1881), p. 373. One prominent collection of self-standing nas\u012bbs (not included in a qa\u1e63\u012bdah) is Mu\u1e25y\u012b al-D\u012bn Ibn al-\u02bfArab\u012b's Tarjum\u0101n al-Ashw\u0101q, a collection of sixty-one nas\u012bbs.Michael Sells, Stations of Desire: Love Elegies from Ibn al-\u02bfArab\u012b and New Poems (Jerusalem: Ibis Editions, 2001). ==Further reading== * Jaroslav Stetkevych, The Zephyrs of Najd: The Poetics of Nostalgia in the Classical Arabic Nas\u012bb (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993) * Jaroslav Stetkevych, 'Toward an Arabic Elegiac Lexicon: The Seven Words of the Nas\u012bb', in Suzanne Pinckney Stetkevych, ed.
