    "text": "Redditch Central Mosque Redditch Central Mosque is a mosque in the town centre area of Redditch, England, run by the Redditch Mosque Committee, and is one of the largest Muslim centres in Redditch. The mosque is open to people of all religious affiliations, men and women, and its main prayer halls currently hold between 1,000 to 1,500 people during a Friday service. Many worshippers walk through the mosque's doors during the 5 daily prescribed prayers and during multiple services held on religious festivals such as Eid. == Since Establishment == Since the mosque's establishment, it has become a focal point for the Redditch Muslim community, providing education for children and adults, lectures and seminars. Over the years, Muslims have used the mosque for events, meetings, lectures, studies and community and educational purposes. Many of the original founders of the mosque committee still make up the mosque management or are trustees of the mosque but as time has passed, many innovations have been made as to how the mosque is democratically run using Islamic teachings as the basis for equal representation of all members of the community. Thus, regular meetings, annual selection and equal opportunities have meant that the running of Redditch Central Mosque has been as efficient as possible over the decades. == History == Redditch Central Mosque is one of the earliest mosques in Redditch. New mosque trustees bought an old disused, empty property on Easmore Road, Redditch in the early 1980s. They raised money by going to local communities for donations both Muslim and non-Muslim. The building was converted to house the mosque and a sign was added to the front with the following testament 'There is no god but Allah and Muhammad is his prophet peace be upon him'. == Management == The mosque is managed by a local committee which is voted in by community leaders == New Mosque Project == Since the 1980s the Muslim community has grown considerably in Redditch and a new mosque was needed to house the growing number of worshippers. Money was raised by the mosque trustees to purchase a new site on Jinnah Road, Redditch in 2003. == External links == * Redditch Central Mosque Website * Redditch New Mosque Project Category:Mosques in England Category:Religion in Worcestershire Category:Buildings and structures in Worcestershire Category:Redditch Category:Religious buildings and structures in Worcestershire ",
