The Petan Ranch owns the reservoir, water rights, and a cabin, but public land surrounding the reservoir is administered by the Bureau of Land Management. The reservoir impounds the Wilson Creek for irrigation storage. It is located 83 miles north-northwest of Elko. ==See also== *List of dams in the Columbia River watershed == References == Category:Dams in Nevada Category:Reservoirs in Nevada Category:Buildings and structures in Elko County, Nevada Category:Dams completed in 1954 Category:Lakes of Elko County, Nevada ",
