In 1262 the castle was captured and razed by Llewelyn ap Gruffydd, who snatched it from the control of the Mortimers. In 1304, Edward I began using material from the castle to erect church tower nearby, which was itself destroyed by the Welsh in 1403. ==Features== There is a moat of depth, which is mostly in a ruined state. The masonry remnant in the mound is believed to have been a square tower. It has an inscription dated 1195, recording a grant for its renovation. Also noted near the bailey are remnants of two towers, which were defended by an artificial lake on the western and southern sides. ==References== Category:Castles in Powys Category:Castle ruins in Wales ",
