Mr ElBaradei's visit to the United States will include meetings with Egyptians abroad to \"discuss his agenda for change and answer their questions on how to move forward\", said an official from Mr ElBaradei's National Association for Change. The trip could represent an opportunity for Mr ElBaradei to focus on one of the stated goals of his National Association for Change: the enfranchisement of Egyptians abroad, many of whom have felt for years that their views on governance are neglected by the regime. In the wake of the strong support for the National Association for Change in the United States, Egyptians living in the US formed the Egyptian Association For Change (EAC). The EAC priorities include a free and fair elections involving all Egyptians including the Egyptian Diaspora, and guarantees of freedom of expression and peaceful political participation. To meet these objectives, the EAC mobilizes communities and individuals to advocate for constitutional reforms and the implementation of specific measures to ensure fair and transparent elections in Egypt. While the EAC support the NAC's call for change and adopted the 7 points it has presented for reform, there is no formal relationship between the two organizations.

On May 1, 2010, Egyptians in America voted in a mock election organized by the EAC. For the first time ever, they participated in a free and fair Egyptian electoral process that included Hamdeen Sabahi, Mohamed ElBaradei, Ayman Nour, Amr Moussa and Gamal Mubarak as candidates. The EAC's main headquarters is in Washington, D.C., with chapters in NY/NJ, Massachusetts, North Carolina, California and Michigan.
