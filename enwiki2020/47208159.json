Puey, Sr., and Vice Mayor Amalio Cueva Sr. The school started with 218 first and second-year students, with third and fourth-year curricula added in the following two years. The campus originally consisted of temporary classrooms in the old municipal hall. A year later, temporary classrooms were set up on the site where the present city gymnasium is located, to educate the 343 first to third-year students. In 1950, an eight hectare school site was purchased from Januario Jison Sr., who donated the sites for the Catholic Church and City Hall. In 1954, with the opening of the Gabaldon Building, the school operation was transferred to that site. The first graduation was in 1951.
