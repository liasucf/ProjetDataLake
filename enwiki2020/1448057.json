Dearinger, Acquired Tastes: 200 Years of Collection for the Boston Athen\u00e6um. Boston:Boston Athen\u00e6um, 2006. The Boston Athen\u00e6um is also known for the many prominent writers, scholars, and politicians who have been members, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Louisa May Alcott, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., John Quincy Adams, Margaret Fuller, Francis Parkman, Amy Lowell, John F. Kennedy, and Edward M. Kennedy. ==History== ===19th century=== In 1803, a young Harvard graduate by the name of Phineas Adams established the magazine The Monthly Anthology, or Magazine of Polite Literature. Adams left the New England area in 1804, having insufficient funds to continue the periodical; however, the printers Munroe and Francis convinced other young men to contribute to and continue the magazine under the new title of The Monthly Anthology and Boston Review. By 1805, these young men founded the Anthology Society. William Smith Shaw, librarian (c. 1807\u20131823) The Boston Athen\u00e6um was founded in 1807 by members of the Anthology Society, literary individuals who began with a plan to have a reading room. The first librarian, William Smith Shaw, and the new trustees had ambitious plans for the Athen\u00e6um, basing their vision on the Athen\u00e6um and Lyceum in Liverpool, England. Their vision was expanded to include a library encompassing books in all subjects in English and foreign languages, a gallery of sculptures and paintings, collections of coins and natural curiosities, and even a laboratory. This ambitious design has developed over the past two hundred years with some changes in focus (e.g., there is no chemistry lab) but remaining true to the ideal expressed in the institution's seal, chosen in 1814: Literarum fructus dulces, meaning \"Sweet are the Fruits of Letters.\" The first yearly subscriptions were sold for ten dollars; only members were allowed to enter the Athen\u00e6um's rooms, although they could bring guests. The Athen\u00e6um's collections were initially non-circulating, meaning that even members could not check out books to take home.For context, see: List of libraries in 19th-century Boston, Massachusetts At first, the Boston Athen\u00e6um rented rooms, then in 1809 bought a small house adjacent to the King's Chapel Burying Ground, and in 1822 moved into a mansion on Pearl Street, where a lecture hall and gallery space were added within four years. In 1823, Shaw stepped down as librarian, and the King's Chapel Library and the Theological Library belonging to the Boston Association of Ministers were deposited in the Athen\u00e6um. Work was begun on a shelf catalog in 1827. That same year, the art gallery was established, and the first annual exhibition opened. Measures were undertaken in 1830 to turn the collections into a circulating library. Once the Athen\u00e6um became a circulating library, only four books were allowed to be checked out at a time. Interior of the Athen\u00e6um, 10\u00bd Beacon Street, c. 1855 (Southworth & Hawes) ====10\u00bd Beacon Street==== By the early 1840s, Boston was a fast-growing city, and Pearl Street was built up commercially, with warehouses crowding around the Athen\u00e6um building. The trustees moved to construct a new building in order to facilitate access to the Athen\u00e6um. Land was acquired on Beacon Street overlooking the Old Granary Burying Ground, and the cornerstone was laid in 1847. In 1849, the current location opened at 10\u00bd Beacon Street. It was the first space designed for the Boston Athen\u00e6um's specific needs. The first floor held the sculpture gallery; the second, the library; and the third, the paintings gallery. The architect was Edward Clarke Cabot, an artist and dilettante whose design was selected because his ingenious arch over graves in the Granary Burial Ground allowed more space on all floors above the basement level. The neo-Palladian fa\u00e7ade of \"Patterson sandstone\" was unique in Boston and remains so today. The Boston Athen\u00e6um included sculptures by John Frazee. ====Cutter Expansive Classification==== Charles Ammi Cutter, librarian (c. 1869) Charles Ammi Cutter became librarian in 1869, succeeding William Frederick Poole. Until this point, work had been uninspired on the comprehensive catalog of the library's holdings. The Athen\u00e6um's exhibition area opened up when the Museum of Fine Arts moved the collections into their own space overlooking Copley Square. Cutter took advantage of the space, using it to spread out the collections and to revise and complete the five-volume catalog. He created his own classification system, known as Expansive Classification, in order to revise and finish the five-volume catalog. Later, the Cutter system became the basis for the Library of Congress classification system; the sections of call number used to alphabetically designate authors\u2019 names are still known as \"Cutter numbers\" in the Library of Congress system. ====Establishment of Museum of Fine Arts==== Many of the Trustees at the Boston Athen\u00e6um participated in the movement to create a separate museum in Boston. In the years 1872\u20131876, Boston's Museum of Fine Arts exhibited in the Athen\u00e6um's gallery space while waiting for construction of its building to be complete. There would be no more annual exhibitions; shelves were installed and the library spread to the first and third floors. ===20th and 21st centuries=== In 1913\u20131914, the Boston Athen\u00e6um employed the architectural firm of Bigelow and Wadsworth to expand the building. The fourth and fifth floors were set back so as not to disrupt the symmetry of the fa\u00e7ade. This renovation fireproofed the building and expanded the space, including addition of the beautiful fifth floor reading room and the fourth floor Trustees\u2019 Room. At the same time, much-needed shelving was installed in the form of a drum stack\u2014that is, a ten-story Snead stack occupying a semi-circular space from the basement to the third floor. The Boston Athen\u00e6um was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1966. Between 1999 and 2002, the Boston Athen\u00e6um undertook a major renovation to update its climate control system, gain more space for books, and add new gallery space on the first floor. In May 2020, Leah Rosovsky was appointed as Stanford Calderwood Director of the Athen\u00e6um. ===Notable members=== * Hannah Adams * John Adams * John Quincy Adams * Louisa May Alcott * Cyrus Alger * Erastus Brigham Bigelow * Nathaniel Bowditch * Uriah Boyden * Josiah Cooke, Jr. * Charles Ammi Cutter * Ralph Waldo Emerson * Margaret Fuller * Samuel Griswold Goodrich * Augustus Addison Gould * Nathaniel Hawthorne * Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. * Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. * John Jay Chapman * John Fitzgerald Kennedy * Edward M.

The Boston Athen\u00e6um's rare and circulating books, maps and manuscripts reflect the collecting interests of the Library as it has narrowed its focus from encyclopedic in the 19th century to an emphasis on the humanities and its large, historic collection of art includes paintings, sculpture, prints, photographs, and decorative arts. Over 260 book funds, the oldest and largest of which was endowed by John Bromfield, Jr.. in 1845, support the addition of more than 3,000 volumes per year to the collection. ===Printed Catalogs=== In addition to catalogs of special collections such as the catalog of the Washington Collection,Appleton P.C.
