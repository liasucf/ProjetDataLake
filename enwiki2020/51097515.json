    "text": "Fort Vernon was a military structure designed to facilitate the slave trade. The Royal African Company built the fort in 1742 near Prampram, a town in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. It was built out of cheap materials \u2013 rough stones and swish. The Danes destroyed the fort before 1783. The British rebuilt it in 1806, but it soon started to collapse and was abandoned in about 1816. It was re-occupied by the British in 1831 but was again abandoned in 1844. It subsequently became ruins. Fort Vernon 8.jpg|Ruins of Fort Vernon Fort Vernon 7.jpg|Remains of Fort Vernon, Back view ==References== Category:History of Ghana Category:Castles in Ghana Vernon ",
