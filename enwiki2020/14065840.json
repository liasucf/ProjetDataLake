    "text": "Jim Adamson (1 August 1905 \u2013 22 August 1991) was an Australian rules footballer who played with North Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL) for over a decade. Adamson made his debut for North Melbourne in 1929 and became a regular in the side throughout the 1930s. He was club captain in both the 1937 and 1940 seasons, the latter as caretaker coach. In 1940 he also won North's Syd Barker Medal, and in doing so at the age of 35 became the second oldest best and fairest winner for any club in the league's history. The only player older was 36-year-old Cyril Gambetta of St Kilda. ==References== ==External links== * * *Listing at nmfc.com.au as deceased Category:1905 births Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:North Melbourne Football Club players Category:North Melbourne Football Club coaches Category:Syd Barker Medal winners Category:1991 deaths ",
