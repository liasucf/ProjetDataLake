    "text": "Chorizo de Bilbao, also known as Chorizo Bilbao, is a Filipino dry pork sausage. The name originates from a genericized trademark. It is native to the Philippines and does not originate from Spain, despite common misconception. The sausage was originally produced by Vicente Genato of the Genato Commercial Corporation in Manila. The name was coined by Genato from his family's original home city of Bilbao, Spain. Today, most of the production has shifted to the American company Marca El Rey, who copied the branding. The sausages are popular among Filipino American communities in the United States and the Philippines. The ingredients of Chorizo de Bilbao is mostly identical to other Filipino longganisas, except for the addition of paprika and its dry texture. ==See also== *Chorizo de Macao ==References== Category:Philippine sausages ",
