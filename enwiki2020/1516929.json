    "text": "Former Mississauga Transit logo Like most other city owned vehicles, transit buses are also identified by a version of the corporate logo MiWay bus stop 5304 located at the intersection of Hurontario and Courtneypark. MiWay's 57 Courtneypark services this stop along with Brampton Transit's 7 Kennedy. MiWay (pronounced \"my way\"; stylized miWAY) is the municipal public transport agency serving Mississauga, Ontario, Canada and responsible to the city's Transportation and Works Department. The current MiWay service consists of two types of bus routes: MiLocal, local buses that make frequent stops, and MiExpress, express buses between major destinations. MiWay is the primary operator along the Mississauga Transitway, a dedicated east to west bus-only roadway. MiWay's routes connect with GO Transit commuter rail and intercity buses. The system also connects with Brampton Transit to the north, Oakville Transit to the west, York Region Transit (YRT) to the northeast, and the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) to the east. MiWay is a member of the Canadian Urban Transit Association. In 2013, MiWay's annual ridership was 35.8 million passengers, with more than 50.9 million boardings. ==History== Public transit in Mississauga was first operated by Charterways Limited as Mississauga Transit Systems with four buses in 1969 and was acquired by the city's newly formed Mississauga Transit in 1974, incorporating the former towns of Mississauga, Port Credit and Streetsville. Services began on November 1, 1973. It later acquired routes formerly operated by others, such as; * TTC's 74 Port Credit bus, in February 1976, that had operated on Lakeshore Road from Long Branch since 1935. This succeeded a former interurban railway, dating back to 1892 as the Toronto and Mimico Electric Railway and Light Company. * Gray Coach Lines, and later GO Transit, also served intercity routes on Dundas Street, and Hurontario Street, both being provincial highways before the construction of present freeways such as Highways 401, 403, 410, and 427. *Malton is still served by TTC's 52 Lawrence West bus, which has replaced 58 Malton. Local services in Malton were provided since 1969, and expanded after 1973. Mississauga Transit was rebranded MiWay on October 4, 2010. New MiWay-branded hybrid buses entered service, with orange MiLocal buses on local routes and blue MiExpress buses on express routes. Advertisements were placed on buses and shelters in September 2010 to introduce users to the new branding. Older buses using the old logo would continue to be used until they are decommissioned. Service levels did not change with the rebranding. The reason for the company's new name is twofold: \"Mi\" could be interpreted as standing for Mississauga, and it is also a homophone for \"My\", suggesting possession. As of December 1, 2011, MiWay\u2019s bus fleet is fully low-floor and accessible. As of October 22, 2012, bus stop pads have been put at all MiWay bus stops. This allowed the entire system, to become fully accessible. On April 29, 2019, 24-hour service was introduced on four bus routes. ==Facilities== ===Major=== {|class=\"wikitable\" !Facility !Address & Coordinates !Opened !Notes |- !Administration |nowrap | 3484 Semenyk Court |2014 |headquarters |- !E.J.

===TTC-contracted routes=== Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) routes within Mississauga require an exact fare, a MiWay ticket or a transfer. A TTC youth, senior or student ticket or token with cash supplement, depending on the category that the passenger falls onto, can also be used for fares. As of July 29, 2019, riders can use a Presto card to pay their Miway fares on contracted TTC-bus routes that operate within the City of Mississauga. However, TTC Presto tickets cannot be used to pay a Miway fare on TTC buses within the City of Mississauga. Transfer privileges apply to and from MiWay routes. Only one route, 52B/52D Lawrence West, is operated by the TTC on behalf of the City of Mississauga. {| class=wikitable style=\"font-size: 100%;\" | !colspan=2|Route !colspan=4|Direction and Termini !Accessible !Operates !Extra Fare Required |- !style=\"background:#;color:white\" align=\"center\" valign=center| 52B |style=\"background:white;color:black\" rowspan=2|Lawrence West !rowspan=2|EB |rowspan=2|To Lawrence Subway Station via Lawrence West Subway Station !rowspan=2|WB |To Westwood Mall !rowspan=2| |Monday through Friday |rowspan=2|West of Pearson Airport |- !style=\"background:#;color:white\" align=\"center\" valign=center| 52D |To Victory Crescent / McNaughton Avenue |Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays |- |} ==Bus rapid transit== In 2007, Mississauga received federal funding for a bus rapid transit (BRT) line, the Mississauga Transitway. The line is built alongside Highway 403, which passes through the City Centre. The line also connects to Toronto Pearson International Airport at Renforth Drive. == Light rail transit == The cities of Mississauga and Brampton will be served by a light rail transit (LRT) route on Hurontario Street between Lakeshore Road and Steeles Avenue in Brampton. This route would link Port Credit, Mississauga City Centre, and Brampton in response to increasing congestion and anticipated high growth in the corridor. This light rail service will replace MiExpress route 103 Hurontario Express. The LRT will connect to two GO Transit rail lines (Milton line at Cooksville GO Station and Lakeshore West line at Port Credit GO Station), and other rapid transit lines including Z\u00fcm Steeles, Z\u00fcm Main, and the Mississauga Transitway). ==Accessibility== MiWay operates low floor, wheelchair accessible buses. The last high-floor bus was retired December 1, 2011. A separate transit service for the disabled, called Transhelp, is operated by the Peel Regional Municipality. ==Schedules== Mississauga Transit's paper \"Ride Schedules\" were discontinued in 2004. From 2005 onward all timetables were only available from the system's website. MiWay provides up-to-date bus schedules via their CityLink telephone service. In November 2005 MiWay inaugurated a schedule finder on their website, called Click 'n Ride, with information specific to each bus stop. ==Fares== the MiWay's cash fare is $3.75 (exact change) for all passengers. Presto cards are being used in the entire MiWay system since May 30, 2011. Traditional fare media: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%;border:1px;\" ! Age group !!

Since launching the Presto card in Mississauga, MiWay has issued more than 9,000 cards and they are currently being used for more 2.4 million trips within the system. MiWay offers two programs exclusively for Presto cardholders: * GO Transit co-fare: Presto cardholders only have to pay 80 cents when connecting to/from GO Transit buses and GO Transit trains at a discounted fare. On the other hand, non-cardholders have to pay the regular MiWay fare when connecting to/from GO buses and GO Trains. * Loyalty program: When Presto cardholders have paid for 12 regular MiWay fares in a calendar week, they would be able to ride for free for the rest of the week. GO Transit co-fares and fares paid on other systems will not be counted towards this program. The weekly ride count resets to zero on Mondays. ===Smart Commute Discount Transit Program=== MiWay is also offering discounted adult transit passes to employees of the members of Smart Commute Mississauga and Smart Commute Pearson Airport Area. Transit passes are automatically paid by deductions on payrolls. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:100%;border:1px;\" ! Employer Discount !! City Discount !! Total Discount !! Monthly Pass Cost |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\" | None || None || None || $132.00 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\" | 15% || 5% || 20% || $105.60 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\" | 25% or more || 15% || 40% or more || $79.20 or less |} ==Fleet== MiWay operates two types of vehicles: regular 40-foot buses and 60-foot articulated buses. Both are fully wheelchair-accessible buses (); however, some bus stops on an accessible route are not accessible due to the lack of bus stop pads for safe loading and unloading for the disabled passengers. {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\" !nowrap|Fleet Numbers||Built||Builder||Model||Status||Notes |- |1-3||1989||OBI||02.501||Retired|| Mississauga City Centre shuttle |- |2001\u20132002||1969||GMC||TDH-3502||Retired||2002 last TDH-3502 built |- |2003||1969||GMC||TDH-3502||Retired|| |- |2004||1968||GMDD||TDH-5303||Retired||ex-Skinner-Sun Parlor Charterways |- |2005\u20132009||1971||GMDD||T6H-5305||Retired|| Sent to Brampton Transit in 1989. |-Nova Scotia Sport Hall of Fame |2012||1970\u20131971||VanHool||Unibus||Retired||Secondhand minibus.
