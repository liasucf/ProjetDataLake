    "text": "Porte Maillot () is a station on Paris M\u00e9tro Line 1 and as Neuilly \u2013 Porte Maillot on the RER C. The station replaces another station of the same name, the original terminus of Line 1, which was demolished and moved in 1936. The name derives from the Porte Maillot, a former gate to the Bois de Boulogne, whose name derives perhaps from maille, or croquet. The present day Porte Maillot is in the centre of a roundabout close to the modern Palais des congr\u00e8s de Paris which the station serves. The centre of the roundabout is a small park, providing a midpoint on the long view between the arches of La Defense and the Arc de Triomphe. ==History== The first station called \"Porte Maillot\" opened in 1900 and was the terminus of Line 1, and was therefore a loop, allowing trains to turn around without reversing. Like Porte Dauphine and Porte de Vincennes, it was arranged with a central waiting area and tracks on either side, with two tunnels. The station was replaced with a new station a short distance to the west with the extension of Line 1 to Pont de Neuilly in 1937. The new line dives down and passes under the old loop. In 1992 this old station was turned into a reception area by the RATP, now the \"Espace Maillot\". The new platforms were built 105 metres long to accommodate 7-car trains in the future, a plan which has never been realised.Hardy, B. Paris Metro Handbook, 3rd edition, Capital Transport Publishing, 1999. Since 1988 and the opening of the northern branch of the C Branch of the RER, this station has served the Neuilly \u2013 Porte Maillot station of the RER C. The two stations are connected by a long corridor. The RER A passes beneath the station, but does not stop. An extension of RER E through Port Maillot from Gare d'Haussmann \u2013 Saint-Lazare to La D\u00e9fense and then towards Mantes-la-Jolie is under consideration. Work is currently underway, but nearing completion to convert \"Espace Maillot\" into a light maintenance facility for the new MP 05 rolling stock, which are fully automated. ==Station layout== {| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border- top:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 valign=top|Street Level |} {| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border- top:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 valign=top|B1 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100 valign=top|Mezzanine for platform connection |} {| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;border-top:solid 1px gray;\" rowspan=5 width=50 valign=top|B2 Platforms |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text- align:center;\" colspan=2| |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100|Westbound |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=390|\u2190 toward La D\u00e9fense \u2013 Grande Arche |- |Eastbound | toward Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes \u2192 |- |style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border- left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;text-align:center;\" colspan=2| |} ==Tourism== The Porte Maillot is an entrance to the Bois de Boulogne, and is located between the avenue Charles de Gaulle of Neuilly-sur- Seine and the avenue de la Grande Arm\u00e9e of Paris. The Palais des congr\u00e8s can be accessed directly via the corridor between the metro and RER stations. The roof over the tracks between the RER station and the Pereire station has been converted into a walkway for pedestrians. == Gallery == File:Portemaillot.JPG|Automatic platform gates at Porte Maillot File:Metro Paris - Ligne 1 - Porte Maillot - Installation facades de quai (7).jpg|Installation of gates in November 2008 File:Metro de Paris - Ligne 1 - Porte Maillot 15.jpg|Platform Signage, exit and interchange signs ==References== Category:Paris M\u00e9tro stations in the 16th arrondissement of Paris Category:Paris M\u00e9tro stations in the 17th arrondissement of Paris Category:Railway stations in France opened in 1936 Category:Railway stations located underground in France ",
