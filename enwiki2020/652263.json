Situated in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship (since 1999), it is the capital of \u0141a\u0144cut County. == History == Archeological investigations carried out in the region of \u0141a\u0144cut confirm the existence of human settlements from about 4000 years B.C. The first owner of the town was Otton (z Pilczy) Pilecki, who was given the \u0141a\u0144cut estate by the Polish king, Casimir III the Great, in 1349, as a reward for his service. At the same time, the king also granted \u0141a\u0144cut its city rights according to Magdeburg law. In 1381 \u0141a\u0144cut was officially named a \u2018town\u2019 for the first time, by Otton Pilecki, in the foundation charter of the town. \u0141a\u0144cut remained under the ownership of the Pilecki family up to 1586.

Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski, fearing attack from the Swedes, further strengthened the fortifications. To perform these works he employed Tylman van Gameren, a Dutchman and one of the most prominent foreign architects to ever work in Poland. The castle is situated in the centre of the town and constructed in the style of a grand aristocratic palace-residence. It was last owned until 1944 by the Potocki family, and made infamous in late 16th century during the times of Stanis\u0142aw Stadnicki,Jacek Komuda, Warcho\u0142y i pijanice, Fabryka S\u0142\u00f3w, 2004, who was known as 'the Devil of \u0141a\u0144cut' (Polish: diabe\u0142 \u0142a\u0144cucki) for his violent behaviour. After 1775 the palace was owned by Izabella Lubomirska, who extended it and had the interiors remodelled. The palace is currently a museum particularly well known for its large collection of historic carriages. Since 1961, a well-known classical music festival is held there annually. In 1772, after the First Partition of Poland, \u0141a\u0144cut became part of the Habsburg Monarchy where it remained until 1918 when it became part of reborn independent Poland. In the 1830s, Ignacy \u0141ukasiewicz, Polish pharmacist and inventor, known as the pioneer of the world's petroleum industry, was an apprentice in a pharmacy in \u0141a\u0144cut. At that time he joined the Polish secret resistance movement, and the Austrian police conducted the first investigation against him. Lubomirski Castle with the orangery in the foreground in the 1810s At the end of the 18th century, Duchess Izabela Lubomirska established a distillery on the vast estate of the Lubomirski family in \u0141a\u0144cut. Count Alfred Wojciech Potocki, a grandson and heir of the Duchess, started to run the \u0141a\u0144cut and Lw\u00f3w Lubomirski estates in 1823. He modernised the management of these properties. The distillery has changed ownership several times and now exists under the name of Polmos \u0141a\u0144cut. It is well known for producing flavoured and sweetened vodkas.Rogala, Jan. Gorza\u0142ka czyli historia i zasady wypalania mocnych trunk\u00f3w, Baobab: 2004. Jews began to settle in \u0141a\u0144cut in the 16th century: the earliest mention of a settler is 1554. The landowner Stanis\u0142aw Lubomirski employed a Jewish factor for his \u0141a\u0144cut estate in 1629. in 1707 the Council of Four Lands (the Polish Jewish parliament). met in \u0141a\u0144cut. A wooden synagogue burnt down in 1716 and new brick synagogue was commenced in 1726. The project was supported by the Lubomirski family and the synagogue, which still stands, was completed in 1761 (see below).Cicohny (2010), pp. 8-9. Local Jewish cemeteries are the resting place of the famous Rabbi Zvi Naftali Horowitz, the Grand Rabbi of Ropczyce and Rabbi Ahron Moshe Leifer, the Grand Rabbi of \u017bo\u0142ynia.Ma\u0144ko, S\u0142awomir. \"Ropczyce: The Chassidic Route\", page 11. \u00a9 Polish Jews Heritage 2008.

Prior to World War II, \u0141a\u0144cut had a thriving Jewish community constituting about one- third of the city population. In 1939 there were 2,750 Jews in \u0141a\u0144cut. The 10th Mounted Rifle Regiment of the Polish Army was stationed in \u0141a\u0144cut in the interbellum. During the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II, on September 9, 1939, \u0141a\u0144cut was a place of fierce defense by Poles under the command of Colonel Stanis\u0142aw Maczek, who would become one of the Polish heroes of World War II. During the subsequent German occupation, the Einsatzgruppe I entered the town between September 17 and October 5, 1939 to commit various atrocities against Poles.Maria Wardzy\u0144ska, By\u0142 rok 1939. Operacja niemieckiej policji bezpiecze\u0144stwa w Polsce. Intelligenzaktion, IPN, Warszawa, 2009, p. 58-59 (in Polish) In November 1939, the Germans deceitfully requested the presence of Polish intelligentsia from the town and county at a supposed conference on the county's economic matters, at which they then arrested over 200 people, including local officials, teachers and priests (see Intelligenzaktion).Wardzy\u0144ska, p. 257 Some of them were imprisoned in Rzesz\u00f3w along with Poles from other towns of the region. A temporary prisoner-of-war camp for Polish soldiers was operated in \u0141a\u0144cut in 1939, and around 25,000 people were held there in mid-November 1939. From 1942 onwards the German occupiers began transportation and murder of the Jewish community; very few of the community survived.Cichocki (2010), pp. 15-16. There is a well-known case where a Jewish family from \u0141a\u0144cut was hidden from the Germans by the Polish Ulma family in the nearby village of Markowa. In 1944 the Germans discovered the hideout and murdered the Polish family and two hidden Jewish families, 16 people in total, including children. The town's architecture avoided significant damage during the war. The last owner of \u0141a\u0144cut, Alfred Antoni Potocki, (14 June 1886 \u2013 30 March 1958), was one of the richest men in prewar Poland, accumulating a fantastic collection of art during his tenancy.\u0141ojek J.
