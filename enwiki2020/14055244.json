According to the company's website, it is the first African-owned and African- managed business to be listed in the Resources sector of the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market. Asa was founded in 1987. ==History== ===2003-2015: Beginning of the company=== ASA founded in 2003 by a consortium of businesspeople, including Kalaa Katema Mpinga, David Fish, Tim Wadeson, Oliver Mandishona Chidawu and Douglas Tawanda Munetsi. Then Mwana Africa, in 2003 ASA became the majority shareholder in Bindura Nickel Corporation after acquiring it from Anglo American Corporation. The following year, it acquired the majority share in Freda Rebecca Gold Mine. It is based in the United Kingdom. China International Mining Group Corporation (CIMGC) became an ASA shareholder in 2012 when it injected $21 million into restarting BNC. In 2012, ASA injected $23 million into BNC, allowing it to refurbish its Trojan Mine. Between 2003 and 2015, ASA loaned $11 million to Freda Rebecca Gold Mine, with ASA placed under administration in the United Kingdom. The firm had a poor financial performance in 2013, with losses totaling $42.5 million, more than $35 million more than the previous year. This was due to a $43.7 million impairment charge for its Bindura Nickel Corporation (BNC) operations in Zimbabwe. In October 2013, Asa appointed Yim Chiu Kwan as its finance director. In 2014, Mwana Africa fired chairperson Mark Wellesley-Wood \"amid suspicion he was an agent for a hostile takeover\" by Centar Mining.\"Mwana Africa sacks chairman\", Herald (February 26, 2014) Mwana Africa in September 2015, rebranded as Asa Resources, with Mwana Africa changing their name after the exit of Mwana founder Kalaa Mpinga.\"Mwana Africa rebrands to Asa Resources\", The Independent (September 30, 2015) Mawana acquired BNC in 2015. ===2016-2018=== In 2016, it owned 85% of the Freda Rebecca gold mine, based in Zimbabwe.\"Changes at Asa Resources\", Mining Journal (December 16, 2016) ASA between 2015 and April 2017 was accused of mismanagement due to the dominance of its shareholder China International Group Corporation.

In 2017, a manhunt was triggered by Zimbabwean authorities for two former ASA Resource Group executives, over allegations of fraud.
