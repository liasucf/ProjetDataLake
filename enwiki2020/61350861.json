    "text": "Endel is a company that specializes in creating technology with personalized sound environments to reduce stress, increase focus and improve sleep. The sounds are generated in real time based on various inputs such as one's location, time, weather, cadence, heart-rate, etc. The technology is backed by neuroscience as it incorporates circadian rhythms, the pentatonic scale, and sound masking. == Product Ecosystem == Endel's technology currently operates through various products such as iOS and Android apps, Alexa Skill, tvOS, and a standalone Apple Watch app is coming soon. It is also intended to be integrated into various forms of hardware and platforms in mobility, hospitality, retail and work-spaces. == History and team == === Team === Endel, launched in 2018 as the brainchild of a Berlin-based team of artists, developers, and entrepreneurs: Oleg Stavitsky, Protey Temen, Philipp Petrenko, Dmitry Evgrafov, Kirill Bulatsev, Dmitry Bezugly. Oleg Stavitsky is a serial entrepreneur and Endel's CEO, Protey Temen is a mixed media artist, whose works exhibited at galleries and biennales around the world and used by the likes of Commes des Gar\u00e7ones, and Dmitry Evgrafov is a neoclassical composer with releases on FatCat Records and Deutsche Grammofon. By then, that core team had already worked together on a multitude of digital projects, including the award-winning kids\u2019 app series, BUBL, eventually acquired by the Berlin- based apps studio Fox & Sheep. === 2019 Warner Music Group Deal and mass media exposure === In January 2019, Endel became the first technology company to sign a distribution deal with Warner Music Group, to produce and release 20 albums as an artist. This deal garnered mass coverage from media including Rolling Stone, Wired, The New Yorker, The Guardian, Wall Street Journal and many more. == Neuroscience == Endel procedurally generates algorithm-powered soundscapes, that adapt in real-time to a number of personal inputs \u2013 such as location, time zone, weather, and heart rate. The technology incorporates circadian rhythms, the pentatonic scale, and sound masking to produce custom sounds, along with an individual's unique aforementioned inputs. Endel focuses on the impact that sound has on one's physiological and psychological well- being. The technology is founded on the work of psychologist, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who is the author of the Experience Sampling Method. Csikszentmihalyi's Experience Sampling Method shows that certain sounds can reduce stress and anxiety and improve focus and thus, have a positive effect on heart rate and blood pressure. A common example is how white noise helps infants sleep. == Investors and Partners == Endel's investors and partners include the Amazon Alexa Fund, Warner Music Group, Sonos, Avex Group, Kima Ventures, Impulse Ventures, Plus Eight Equity Partners, Waverley Capital, Powerhouse Capital, Techstars Music, Major Lazor's Chris Leacock, and DJ La Fleur. In September 2020, Endel raised $5 million in Series A funding led by Kevin Rose of True Ventures, along with Sleepscore Ventures, Techstars Ventures, Impulse Ventures, Plus 8 Equity Partners, Waverly Capital, Amazon Alexa Fund, Target Global and other angel investors. == References == Category:Companies of Germany ",
