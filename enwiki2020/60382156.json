On September 20, 2019, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer announced the bill was scheduled for a floor vote for the week of September 23 under suspension of the rules. Under suspension of House rules, the bill may not be amended, and must be approved by two thirds of the House of Representatives. The bill was passed by the House on September 25, 2019. The bill was originally drafted exclusively with banking institutions within its scope. However, the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents and other lobbying organizations achieved the addition of language from the \"Clarifying Law Around Insurance of Marijuana\" (CLAIM) Act, which existed in similar versions in both the House and the Senate. The added language rules out criminal and civil prosecution for both the entities and their employees or officers for the business of insuring cannabis-related industry when such industry is located in states which have legalized such activity. The SAFE Banking Act provisions were included in the HEROES Act Covid-19 relief bill passed in the U.S. House in May 2020. They were again included in a bill approved by the house 214\u2013207 in October. ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== *H.R.1595 - SAFE Banking Act of 2019 U.S. House of Representatives official website Category:Proposed legislation of the 116th United States Congress Category:Banking in the United States Category:Cannabis industry Category:2019 cannabis law reform Category:Cannabis in the United States Category:Insurance in the United States ",
