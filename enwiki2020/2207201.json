La peinture fran\u00e7aise de 1815 \u00e0 1850, Catalog for the Exposition Itin\u00e9rante, Paris, 1995 Eventually, he was able to attend the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, where he worked with Pierre R\u00e9voil until 1818, then studied with Fleury Fran\u00e7ois Richard, after he took over as Director. His studies were, however, sporadic and much was learned on his own. He is, therefore, often referred to as \"self- taught\". He also travelled to Italy, Greece and the Middle East. His first exhibition at the Salon in 1824 was well received. That same year, the Archdiocese commissioned four paintings from R\u00e9voil's former students, including Biard. In 1827, he travelled again, visiting Malta, Cyprus and Egypt. He later obtained the support of the July Monarchy, which acquired several of his works. In 1838, he was decorated with the Legion of Honor.Listing @ the Base L\u00e9onore In 1839, he participated in a scientific expedition, led by Joseph Paul Gaimard, that went to Spitsbergen and LapplandCatalogue r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par Genevi\u00e8ve Lacambre, Le Palais du luxembourg en 1874.. He was joined by his fianc\u00e9e, the writer L\u00e9onie d\u2019Aunet, who published an account of the trip in 1854, entitled Voyage d\u2019une femme au SpitzbergDictionnaire des artistes de langue fran\u00e7aise en Am\u00e9rique du Nord, peintres, sculpteurs, dessinateurs, Karl David, Ed.

He married L\u00e9onie in 1840. Three years later, she became the mistress of Victor Hugo. In 1845, she was caught with him, in flagrante delicto, at a hotel. She was arrested for adultery, but Hugo was let go after invoking his inviolability as a member of the Chamber of Peers.Le cimeti\u00e8re de Samois - Personnes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres et bienfaiteurs enterr\u00e9s au cimeti\u00e8re du village.

He was offered a teaching position at the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, but declined in favor of continuing his travels. . Before returning to France, he detoured through North America and painted some scenes depicting slavery..
