    "text": "Jamil Baroody (1905 \u2013 March 4, 1979) was a Saudi diplomat who served as representative to the United Nations from the organization's first meeting in 1946 until his death. ==Personal life== Baroody married an American woman and had four children who were educated in the United States.\"Jamil the Irrepressible,\" TIME, 12/13/1971, Vol. 98, Issue 24. ==Early life, education, and early career== Baroody was born in Souk-el-Gharb, Lebanon in 1905.\"Jamil the Irrepressible,\" TIME, 12/13/1971, Vol. 98, Issue 24. A Maronite Christian, he studied at American University in Beirut and began his diplomatic career in 1929. He served as a delegate to the League of Nations. He taught at Princeton University during the Second World War and worked as a consultant for the Arabic version of Reader's Digest.\"Member States Pay Tribute to Late Mr. Baroody (Saudi Arabia),\" UN Monthly Chronicle 16, no. 3 (March 1979): i-viii ==Career at the United Nations== A friend of King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, Baroody was appointed Saudi representative to the United Nations at its founding and was given unusual power to shape Saudi positions there, a contrast to other representatives who mostly took orders from their Foreign Ministries.Roland Burke, Decolonization and the Evolution of International Human Rights (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011), 12 Baroody was known as a master of UN procedure and a colorful orator whose frankness, passion, and wit enlivened often dull debates. A profile in TIME Magazine humorously claimed that he might \"be responsible for preventing untold numbers of colleagues from dying of sheer boredom,\" thanks to his original and eccentric speeches.\"Jamil the Irrepressible,\" TIME, 12/13/1971, Vol. 98, Issue 24 In 1971 U.S. delegate Ed Derwinski said of Baroody: \"The oratorical skill of the distinguished delegate is almost overpowering. I am convinced that if Mr. Winston Churchill in his heyday had debated Mr. Baroody, he would have come across second best.\"\"Jamil the Irrepressible,\" TIME, 12/13/1971, Vol. 98, Issue 24. According to historian Roland Burke, one of Baroody's speeches on human rights was \"a rhetorical vortex of references to the dinosaurs and their apparent demise by predation from the sabre-toothed tiger, digressions on the Sumerians, and on the dangers of psychiatry.\"Roland Burke, \"'How Times Flies': Celebrating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the 1960s,\" International History Review 38, 3 (2016): 412. According to another account, Baroody's interventions were \"always wide- ranging, often entertaining; but he tended to speak at inconvenient times and at excessive length ... declaring awkward truths.\"Sydney Dawson Bailey and Larry Bailey, The Procedure of the UN Security Council (Clarendon Press, 1988), 130 Among the causes he defended throughout his career was Palestinian statehood. During a heated 1975 debate on Zionism, Baroody called Zionists \"an alien people in our midst\" and decried Jewish money and Jewish influence.Gil Troy, Moynihan's Moment: America's Fight Against Zionism as Racism (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), 141. When he died, he was the longest-serving member of any member states. The United Nations Secretary General Kurt Waldheim ordered the UN flag in New York flown at half-mast, an honor usually reserved for heads of state.\"Member States Pay Tribute to Late Mr. Baroody (Saudi Arabia),\" UN Monthly Chronicle 16, no. 3 (March 1979): i-viii. ==References== ==Further reading== * \"Member States Pay Tribute to Late Mr. Baroody (Saudi Arabia),\" UN Monthly Chronicle 16, no. 3 (March 1979): i-viii. * \"Jamil the Irrepressible,\" TIME, 12/13/1971, Vol. 98, Issue 24.
