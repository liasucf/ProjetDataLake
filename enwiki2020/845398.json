Founded in October 1950, the IPI has members in over 120 countries. IPI's membership is made up of editors and media executives working for some of the world's most respected media outlets. IPI has also established a new membership category: \"IPI Leading Journalists\" which is open to heads of media departments, bureau chiefs, correspondents and others. In several countries, including Nepal and Azerbaijan, IPI members have established National Committees that support IPI in its work to improve the situation for media. IPI enjoys consultative status with the UN, UNESCO and the Council of Europe. IPI is a member of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange, a global network of non-governmental organisations that monitors press freedom and free expression violations worldwide. It is also a member of the Tunisia Monitoring Group, a coalition of 16 free expression organisations that lobbies the Tunisian government to improve its human rights record. In October 2006, the U.S. National Television Academy (NTA) honoured IPI with an International Emmy Award for its press freedom work. ==Activities== ===Protest Letters=== IPI monitors press freedom around the world and responds to threats and attacks on journalists and media outlets by sending protest letters to governments and inter-governmental organisations.
