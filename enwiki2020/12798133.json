Symons served as Chairman of ten different insurance and financial institutions across Canada and the United States, including Goran Capital Inc., Symons International Group, Pafco General Insurance Company, IGF Insurance Company, and GGS Management Inc. ==Early life== Born in 1921 in Lachine, Quebec, Symons grew up in Dixie, a small residential town with two brothers, John and Arthur (Randy). Each of the three boys grew to become surviving pilots in the Second World War. Their father, Gerald Symons, was a surviving member of the Canadian Forces of World War I and World War II. ==War service== Gordon Symons began his military career with the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1941 and graduated as a Sergeant-Pilot. He was soon sent overseas on the Queen Mary and was sent for training in Bournemouth on the south coast of England.

A decade later, in 1964, he formed G. Gordon Symons Co. Ltd., a predecessor to Goran Capital Inc., a public holding company specializing in insurance. Over the course of three decades, Symons grew his family of companies, becoming one of the largest non-standard automobile insurers in the United States. ==The Boys of Spring== In 2006, Symons released a World War II autobiography entitled The Boys of Spring. The 713-page book contains actual flight mission records, obtained by Symons through R.A.F.
