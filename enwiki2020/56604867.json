    "text": "Hipster Antitrust refers to the movement to shift the focus of United States antitrust law from the maximization of consumer welfare to include other goals, such as income inequality, unemployment, and wage growth. ==Description== Senator Cory Booker has been described as an ally of the Hipster Antitrust movement, and has called on the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division and Federal Trade Commission to focus their enforcement efforts more on helping workers. The movement has also been called the \"New Brandeis Movement\", a reference to former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. The term \"appeals to nostalgia for old-fashioned antitrust enforcement\". The term originally began as a Twitter hashtag, and rose to prominence when Senator Orrin Hatch used the term during multiple speeches on the United States Senate floor. Some proponents of the movement believe the term is pejorative. ==Origin== The term was coined by Konstantin Medvedovsky, an attorney at Dechert, and popularized by former Federal Trade Commissioner Joshua D. Wright. ==Conferences== The term has since been the subject of both academic conferences, research papers, and academic journals. == References == Category:Politics of the United States Category:United States antitrust law ",
