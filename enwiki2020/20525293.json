    "text": "The 2008 Brut Sun Bowl, part of the 2008\u201309 NCAA Division I FBS bowl season, was played on December 31, 2008 at the stadium of the same name on the campus of the University of Texas at El Paso in El Paso, Texas. The 75th annual contest pitted the Pittsburgh Panthers against the Oregon State Beavers. Pittsburgh previously appeared in the Sun Bowl in 1975 and 1989. Oregon State previously appeared in the Sun Bowl only once, in 2006. Entering the contest, the teams had a combined 3\u20130 record in Sun Bowls. Oregon State won 3\u20130, the lowest scoring bowl game since a 0\u20130 tie between Air Force and TCU in the 1959 Cotton Bowl Classic and the lowest-scoring Sun Bowl since a 0\u20130 tie between Arizona State and Catholic University on January 1, 1940. It was the first shutout loss for the Panthers since 1996. This game, however, was special because the only points were scored on a field goal kicked off of a botched hold. Oregon State opted to wear orange uniforms, even though as the nominal visiting team they should have worn white. As a result, they were docked a time out in lieu of a penalty. This game marked the 41st consecutive telecast by CBS Sports. No other network and bowl game has been paired for a longer period of time. The halftime show included a performance by musical group The Village People as Sun Bowl officials broke the Guinness World Record for largest Y.M.C.A. dance. ==Scoring summary== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
