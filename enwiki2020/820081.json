None of my ancestors knew their age.\" was a Mazatec sabia, or curandera, who lived in Huautla de Jim\u00e9nez, a town in the Sierra Mazateca area of the Mexican state of Oaxaca in southern Mexico.Rothenberg, Jerome. 2003. \"Editor's Preface\" in Mar\u00eda Sabina: Selections. University of California Press. p. x Her healing sacred mushroom ceremonies, called veladas, were based on the use of psilocybin mushrooms, such as Psilocybe cyanescens. They are known for introducing the western world to entheogenic mushrooms. == Life == Mar\u00eda Sabina was born outside of Huautla de Jim\u00e9nez in the Sierra Mazateca toward the end of the 19th century. Though Sabina herself was not sure, she believed her birth year was 1894. Her parents were both campesinos; her mother was Mar\u00eda Concepcion, while her father, Crisanto Feliciano, died from an illness when she was three years old. She had a younger sister, Mar\u00eda Ana. Her grandfather and great-grandfather on her father's side were shamans as well, skilled in using the mushrooms to communicate with God, according to their beliefs. After the death of her father, her mother moved the family into town, and Sabina grew up in the house of her maternal grandparents.Rothenberg, Jerome, with Alvaro Estrada. 2003. \"The Life\" in Mar\u00eda Sabina: Selections. University of California Press. p. 3\u20138 Mar\u00eda Sabina was the first contemporary Mexican curandera, or sabia (one who knows\"), to allow Westerners to participate in the healing ritual known as the velada.In Spanish, the noun la velada refers to a vigil or watch, and is uniformly a nocturnal one. , as defined in the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola's Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola (RAE 2001)It was R. Gordon Wasson who used the term by which it has since become generally known when he first wrote about the ritual in Mar\u00eda Sabina and Her Mazatec Mushroom Velada (1974). See Karttunen 1994: 225. All participants in the ritual ingested psilocybin mushroom as a sacrament to open the gates of the mind. The velada is seen as a purification and a communion with the sacred. In 1955, the US ethnomycologist and banker R. Gordon Wasson visited Mar\u00eda Sabina's hometown and participated in a velada with her. He collected spores of the fungus, which he identified as Psilocybe mexicana, and took them to Paris. The fungus was cultivated in Europe and its primary psychoactive ingredient, psilocybin, was isolated in the laboratory by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann in 1958. Wasson wrote a book about his experience of the ritual in a 1957 Life magazine article, Seeking the Magic Mushroom; her name and location were not revealed. Wasson later published 512 copies of his two-volume book called Russia, Mushrooms and History, the second volume of which revealed her identity and location. The information was contained in an account of his and his wife's first velada with Aurelio Carreras, Mar\u00eda Sabina\u2019s son-in-law, on 15 August 1953, two years before they consumed the mushrooms themselves. Young people from the United States began seeking out Mar\u00eda Sabina and the \"magic\" mushrooms as early as 1962,Estrada 1996 passim; Monaghan & Cohen 2000: 165 with numerous hippies, scientists, and other people visiting the remote isolated village of Hualta de Jimenez. Mar\u00eda Sabina received several of them, including Wasson, who became a friend. Many 1960s celebrities, including Bob Dylan, John Lennon, and Keith Richards, were rumored to have visited Mar\u00eda Sabina, but these claims cannot be substantiated as no photographic evidence or written reports of the visits by the rock stars themselves have ever been reported. While she was initially hospitable to the first of the arrivals, their lack of respect for the sacred and traditional purposes caused Mar\u00eda Sabina to remark: > Before Wasson, nobody took the children simply to find God. They were always > taken to cure the sick. As the community was besieged by Westerners wanting to experience the mushroom-induced hallucinations, Sabina attracted attention from the Mexican police who believed her to be a drug dealer. The unwanted attention completely altered the social dynamics of the Mazatec community and threatened to terminate the Mazatec custom. The community blamed Sabina; consequently she was ostracized and her house was burned down. Sabina later regretted having introduced Wasson to the practice, but Wasson contended that his only intention was to contribute to the sum of human knowledge, despite being funded by the CIA\u2019s mind control project MK Ultra.Estrada, \u00c1lvaro, (1976) Vida de Mar\u00eda Sabina: la sabia de los hongos () Rothenberg, Jerome. 2003. \"Editor's Preface\" in Mar\u00eda Sabina: Selections. University of California Press. p. xvi From 1967 to 1977 life returned to normal conditions for Hualta de Jimenez and the Mazatec after the Mexican Army blocked American, European and Mexican hippies or other unwanted visitors from entering on the only roads into the town. A few Federales also patrolled the town to evict undesirable foreign visitors. \u00c1lvaro Estrada wrote a biography of Mar\u00eda Sabina that was translated into English by Henry Munn. Sabina spoke only Mazatec and many of her supposed quotes in English are not verified. Estrada's book was translated from English into Spanish by Henry Munn who had lived in Hualta de Jimenez and knew the Mazatec language. Munn wrote two reports on sacred mushroom veladas and curanderos: The Mushrooms of Language was about the traditional ceremonies of the typical curanderos in Hualta; the second was called The Uniqueness of Mar\u00eda Sabina. Another book on her song-poem chants was Mar\u00eda Sabina: Selections by Jerome Rothenberg. The Sacred Mushroom of Mexico, by Brian Akers, has excerpts from five Mexican authors translated from Spanish to English. Los Hongos Alucinantes (in Spanish) by Fernando Benitez dispels many rumors about her life. Plate 37 of the Codex Vindobonensis or Yuta Tnoho (Mixtec culture, Late Post-Classic Mesoamerican) The book Sacred Mushroom Rituals: The Search for the Blood of Quetzalcoatl, by Tom Lane, has several chapters by the author on the experiences he, his wife, and a friend had at her home in a velada with Mar\u00eda Sabina and her daughter Appolonia. The book reports on Mar\u00eda's musical tonal songs, poetic expressions, ventriloquy, incantations and chanting during the velada. The rituals before the ceremony and prayers for the participants are similar to those recorded by Wasson in his visits during the mid-1950s. After publishing his book on ethnomycology, Russia, Mushrooms and History, Wasson wrote Mar\u00eda Sabina and her Mazatec Mushroom Velada with George and Florence Cowan and Willard Rhodes, which included four cassette recordings and the musical score of Sabina's veladas, with lyrics translated from Mazatec to Spanish to English. Henry Munn later translated these songs into English in \u00c1lvaro Estrada's book. The entheogenic use of the sacred mushrooms (hongos sagrados) practiced by Mar\u00eda Sabina had roots in Pre-Columbian Mexico. By her meeting R. Gordon Wasson and her veladas being recorded in the mid-1950s, these ancient Mazatec ceremonies and rituals were preserved. Similar ceremonies were recorded in the late Post-Classic Mesoamerican Mixtec codex Yuta Tnoho or Vindobonensis Mexicanus I (Latin), written in the 16th century, and in the Three Stelae of Xochimilco, but until Wasson met Mar\u00eda Sabina in the early 1950s there was almost no proof that the sacred mushroom healing and divination ceremonies and rituals actually existed. == Use of synthetic entheogens == In 1958, the French mycologist Roger Heim brought psilocybin tablets to Mar\u00eda Sabina and the first velada using the active principal of the mushrooms rather than the raw mushrooms themselves took place. In 1962, R. Gordon Wasson and Albert Hofmann went to Mexico to visit her. They also brought a bottle of psilocybin pills.http://www.sagewisdom.org/ott2.html Sandoz was marketing them under the brand name Indocybin\u2014\"indo\" for both Indian and indole (the nucleus of their chemical structures) and \"cybin\" for the main molecular constituent, psilocybin. Hofmann gave his synthesized entheogen to the curandera. \"Of course, Wasson recalled, Albert Hofmann is so conservative he always gives too little a dose, and it didn't have any effect.\" Hofmann had a different interpretation: \"activation of the pills, which must dissolve in the stomach, takes place after 30 to 45 minutes. In contrast, the mushrooms when chewed, work faster as the drug is absorbed immediately\". To settle her doubts about the pills, more were distributed. Mar\u00eda, her daughter, and the shaman, Don Aurelio, ingested up to 30 mg each was ingested, a moderately high dose by current standards but not perhaps by the more experienced practitioners. At dawn, their Mazatec interpreter reported that Mar\u00eda Sabina felt there was little difference between the pills and the mushrooms. She thanked Hofmann for the bottle of pills, saying that she would now be able to serve people even when no mushrooms were available.Psychedelics Encyclopedia, p 237\u2013238 == Chants == \u00c1lvaro Estrada, a fellow Mazatec, recorded her life and work and translated her chants. Estrada's American brother-in-law, Henry Munn, translated many of the chants from Spanish to English, and wrote about the significance of her language. Munn wrote that Mar\u00eda Sabina brilliantly used themes common to Mazatec and Mesoamerican spiritual traditions, but at the same time was \"a unique talent, a masterful oral poet, and craftsperson with a profound literary and personal charisma\". It is sung in a shamanic trance in which, as she recounted, the \"saint children\" speak through her: == Cultural impact == Sabina is regarded as a sacred figure in Huautla. At the same time, her image is used to market various local commercial ventures, from restaurants to taxi companies. The Mexican counterculture has an affinity for Sabina. The Mexican rock group Santa Sabina is named after her, and El Tri, one of the first and most successful rock groups in Mexico, dedicated the song \"Mar\u00eda Sabina\" to her, proclaiming her \"un s\u00edmbolo de la sabidur\u00eda y el amor\" (\"a symbol of wisdom and love\"). Mexican musician, Jorge Reyes, included prerecorded chants of Mar\u00eda Sabina in the track \"The Goddess of the Eagles\", in his album Comala. Reyes also used more of the recording in his collaboration with Deep Forest on the track \"Tres Mar\u00edas\", from the Album Comparsa. Bolivian singer Luzmila Carpio has recorded a song in honor of Mar\u00eda Sabina. Mexican poet and novelist Homero Aridjis has written a novel, Carne de Dios, about Mar\u00eda Sabina, her life in Huautla and her experience with Westerners who flocked to her home to experience the hallucinogenic effects of the mushrooms. Aridjis brought Mar\u00eda Sabina to Mexico City for medical treatment towards the end of her life.https://brooklynrail.org/2019/02/fiction/Excerpt-of-Carne-de-Dios Hualta de Jimenez was without electricity and few signs of the 20th century until after Mar\u00eda Sabina died in 1985. The Mazatec sacred mushroom veladas have survived into the 21st century and are now accepted by the Catholic Church there. == Notes == == References == * * Allen, John W., and Jochen Gartz, 2002.
