    "text": "Oaxaca is a compilation album by American jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi released by D&D; Records (Guaraldi's briefly resurrected label) in 2004. The album is a mix of previously unreleased studio and live recordings taped in 1971. ==Background== In the mid-2000s, Vince Guaraldi's son, David Guaraldi, worked with audio archivist Michael Graves at his Atlanta, Georgia-based Osiris Studio, in an effort to restore a wealth of unreleased recorded material from his father's archives. The recordings on Oaxaca come from a variety of sources: some songs were performed live at In Your Ear, a jazz club based in Palo Alto, California; one is performed at The Matrix in San Francisco, with remaining tracks taped at Golden State Recorders in San Francisco. The release features covers of The Rolling Stones' \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" and The Beatles' \"Something\" and \"You Never Give Me Your Money\", both from Abbey Road. Oaxaca was released on CD only. It did not receive a vinyl release. ==Critical reception== All About Jazz critic David Rickert commented that Oaxaca \"could be called In A Silent Way, Charlie Brown,\" adding that Guaraldi is \"powered by a rhythm section well versed in providing a driving rock beat. Armed with an arsenal of electronic devices, they turn 'You Can't Always Get What You Want' into a ferocious squall, yet display a gentler touch on 'Something.' It's a testament to Guaraldi's abilities as a musician that all this works as well as it does, and his treatments of these relatively new songs show a skill at interpretation that was never quite apparent in his early days as a pianist dealing with standards.\" Rickert concluded by saying, \"it should come as no surprise that Guaraldi is still capable of crafting amazingly catchy melodies, and the title track is one of his finest.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from CD liner notes. ;The Vince Guaraldi Quartet: *Vince Guaraldi \u2013 piano, Fender Rhodes, Hammond B-3, clavinet *Vince Denham \u2013 saxophone, flute *Koji Kataoka \u2013 bass *Mike Clark \u2013 drums ;Additional: * Derrick Bang \u2013 liner notes * David Guaraldi \u2013 producer * Michael Graves \u2013 engineer (audio restoration), producer ==References== ==External links== * Category:2004 compilation albums Category:2004 live albums Category:Albums arranged by Vince Guaraldi Category:Vince Guaraldi compilation albums Category:Cool jazz compilation albums Category:Mainstream jazz compilation albums Category:Peanuts music Category:Vince Guaraldi live albums Category:Live cool jazz albums Category:Live mainstream jazz albums ",
