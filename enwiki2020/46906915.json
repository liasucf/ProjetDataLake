    "text": "Matthew James Taylor (born 30 March 1990) is an English professional footballer who plays as a striker for club Oxford United. ==Career== ===Early career=== Taylor was born in Oxford, Oxfordshire. His football career started at Oxford United where he made seven substitute appearances in two seasons. In 2008, he had a loan spell at Southern League Division One South & West club Abingdon United. In June 2009, he signed for newly promoted Southern League Premier Division club Didcot Town on a free transfer, following his release from Oxford days after helping the team lift the Oxfordshire Senior Cup. In 2009, he moved on to Southern League South & West Division club North Leigh. In two seasons at Eynsham Park, he scored 80 goals. In September 2011 he had a trial with Cheltenham Town but went on to sign for Forest Green Rovers, having rejected a move to Newport County. ===Forest Green Rovers=== His first goals for the Nailsworth club came in a 4\u20131 win over Alfreton Town as Taylor netted a hat-trick. He went on to score a further seven goals as Forest Green finished 10th in the Conference Premier. In his second season at the club he scored 11 times in league and cup competitions, earning himself a contract extension to summer 2014. He struggled for form in his third season and was loaned out to fellow Conference Premier club Chester in January 2014 until the end of the season. Having scored six times in seven matches, he was recalled by his parent club, but failed to score again in his remaining 12 appearances. ===Bristol Rovers=== In June 2014, Taylor signed for recently relegated Conference Premier club Bristol Rovers, reportedly rejecting offers from former club Oxford United and Chester as well as Mansfield Town and Kidderminster Harriers. His Bristol Rovers career got off to a difficult start as he scored just three times in his first 18 matches. He finished the season with 20 goals, including one in each of the play-off semi-final matches against Forest Green Rovers. He played the full 120 minutes of the play-off Final and scored Rovers' second penalty of the shoot-out as Rovers secured an immediate return to the Football League. Taylor scored his first Football League goal in a 3\u20131 win against Barnet. A successful start to his season resulted in Taylor scoring eight goals in all competitions before mid November, including two goals against Carlisle United. Taylor reached 14 goals in all competitions before Christmas, including hat-tricks in a 3\u20130 victory against Wycombe Wanderers and a 4\u20131 win against Hartlepool United. On the final day of the season, Bristol Rovers achieved promotion to League One by scoring a dramatic winner in the 92nd minute. Lee Brown scored the decisive goal after Taylor himself hit the post. Taylor finished the season with 27 goals and five assists, outscoring every player in the Football League. Taylor proceeded to score on his League One debut against Scunthorpe United in a 3\u20131 loss. On 18 October 2016, Taylor scored a second-half hat-trick to earn a point for the Rovers against Milton Keynes Dons in a 3\u20133 draw. ===Bristol City=== On 31 January 2017, Taylor left Bristol Rovers to join rivals Bristol City, activating the release clause reported to be \u00a3300,000. Taylor became the first player to move directly from Bristol Rovers to Bristol City since Trevor Morgan in 1987. In October 2017, as part of an interview for the BBC Points West programme, Bristol City manager Lee Johnson described how he received a death threat during the 2016\u201317 season after signing Taylor. During this episode Johnson moved house after his family's home address was put online. On 11 February 2017, Taylor made his first start for Bristol City, in a league match away to Derby County. He scored his first goal for the club in the 14th minute, firing home from close range after teammate Aden Flint saw his header cleared off the line. Taylor would go on to play a key role in City's next two goals, the match eventually ending 3\u20133. During the 2017\u201318 season Bristol City reached the semi finals of the EFL Cup and Taylor scored in the victories against Premier League opponents Stoke City and Crystal Palace, as well as setting up the 93rd-minute winner in the quarter-final victory over cup holders Manchester United. ====Oxford United (loan)==== On 19 August 2019, Taylor joined Oxford United on loan till the end of the season. He made his debut in a 4\u20132 League One defeat to Burton Albion on 20 August 2019, and scored his first goal in a 6\u20130 away victory over Lincoln City on 21 September. He finished the COVID-affected 2019\u201320 season as top scorer for the club, scoring 17 goals (13 in League games). ===Oxford United=== On 31 July 2020, he signed a three-year permanent deal with Oxford. ==Career statistics== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|FA Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=3|Oxford United |2007\u201308 |Conference Premier |3||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||1||0||4||0 |- |2008\u201309 |Conference Premier |4||0||2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||1||0||7||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !7||0||2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||2||0||11||0 |- |rowspan=4|Forest Green Rovers |2011\u201312 |Conference Premier |29||10||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||2||0||32||10 |- |2012\u201313 |Conference Premier |42||9||3||1||colspan=2|\u2014||2||1||47||11 |- |2013\u201314 |Conference Premier |25||3||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||2||0||27||3 |- !colspan=2|Total !96||22||4||1||colspan=2|\u2014||6||1||106||24 |- |Chester (loan) |2013\u201314 |Conference Premier |7||6||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||7||6 |- |rowspan=4|Bristol Rovers |2014\u201315 |Conference Premier |45||18||2||1||colspan=2|\u2014||4||2||51||21 |- |2015\u201316 |League Two |46||27||1||0||1||0||2||1||50||28 |- |2016\u201317 |League One |27||16||2||2||2||0||2||1||33||19 |- !colspan=2|Total !118||61||5||3||3||0||8||4||134||68 |- |rowspan=5|Bristol City |2016\u201317 |Championship |15||2||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||15||2 |- |2017\u201318 |Championship |18||1||1||0||4||2||colspan=2|\u2014||23||3 |- |2018\u201319 |Championship |33||4||2||0||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||36||4 |- |2019\u201320 |Championship |1||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||1||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !67||7||3||0||5||2||colspan=2|\u2014||75||9 |- |Oxford United (loan) |2019\u201320 |League One |26||13||4||1||3||2||4||1||37||17 |- !colspan=3|Career total !321||109||18||1||11||4||20||6||370||124 |} ==Honours== Bristol Rovers *Conference Premier play-offs: 2015 *Football League Two third-place promotion: 2015\u201316 Individual *PFA Team of the Year: 2015\u201316 League Two ==References== ==External links== *Profile at the Bristol City F.C. website * Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Oxford Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Oxford United F.C. players Category:Abingdon United F.C. players Category:Didcot Town F.C. players Category:North Leigh F.C. players Category:Forest Green Rovers F.C. players Category:Chester F.C. players Category:Bristol Rovers F.C. players Category:Bristol City F.C. players Category:National League (English football) players Category:Southern Football League players Category:English Football League players ",
