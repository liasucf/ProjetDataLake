The population at the 2001 census was 2,965 people. ==History== The first mention of Lipetsk Polyana dates back to 1653. In March- April 1919, Soviet power existed in the village. In 1932, the organization of the HR Committee began to operate, whose first secretary was I. Perez. After the liberation of the Lipetsk Polyany from the Nazi occupiers (October 24, 1944), 23 residents voluntarily entered the Red Army, and 9 were part of the 1st Czechoslovak Army Corps. 2 of them were awarded with orders and medals of the USSR, 18 gave their lives in battles for freedom and independence of the Motherland. In the village there is a monument to fellow villagers, who died in the struggle against the Nazis.https://uk.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u041b\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0446\u044c\u043a\u0430_\u041f\u043e\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0430 In 1930, the Jewish population was 239. With the Hungarian occupation of the region in March, 1939, Jews were forcefully removed from their occupations. From 1940 to 1941, Jews from the village were drafted into forced labor battalions and others were drafted for service on the Eastern front, where most died. By 1941, the Jewish population had increased to 280 and Jewish families without Hungarian citizenship were expelled to Nazi occupied Ukrainian territory, to Kamenets- Podolski, and murdered there. The remaining Jews of Lypetska Polyana were deported to Auschwitz late May, 1944.https://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/Lypetska_Polyana/ ==See also== *Zakarpattia Oblast ==References== Category:Villages in Zakarpattia Oblast Category:Carpatho-Ukraine Category:Villages in Khust Raion Category:Holocaust locations in Ukraine ",
