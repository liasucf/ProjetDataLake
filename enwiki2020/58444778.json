It derived its name from Thetis, the mother of Achilles, the national hero of the Achaean Phthiotae. Its site is at a location called Agios Athanasios or Kato Dasolofos, within the boundaries of the modern village of Thetidio, which echoes the ancient name. ==References== Category:Populated places in ancient Thessaly Category:Former populated places in Greece Category:Thessaliotis ",
