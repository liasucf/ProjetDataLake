Quinquela Mart\u00edn is considered the port painter-par-excellence and one of the most popular Argentine painters. His paintings of port scenes show the activity, vigor and roughness of the daily life in the port of La Boca. ==Early years== Quinquela posing with a figurehead, 1936 Quinquela at his studio, 1964 His birthday could not be determined precisely as he was abandoned on March 20, 1890 at an orphanage with a note that stated \"This kid has been baptized, and his name is Benito Juan Mart\u00edn\". From his physical appearance, the nuns who found him deduced that he should be around twenty days old; thus March 1 is regarded as his birthday. Adopted by Manuel and Justina Molina de Chinchella when he was seven years old, he adopted his stepfather's surname (which would later be hispanized as Quinquela). At the age of 14 he attended a modest night school of art in La Boca while working during day on the family's coal-yard. When he turned 17 years old he joined the Pezzini Stiattesi Conservatory, where he stayed until 1912. ==International Exhibitions== By 1910 he had started appearing in small art exhibitions, mainly in and around La Boca. He obtained the second prize on the Sal\u00f3n Nacional (Spanish, \"National Exhibition\") in 1920. After an exhibition at Mar del Plata in the same year, he was sent as the Argentine representative to an exhibition in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil attended by local personalities including Brazilian president Epitacio Pessoa. By the 1920s Marcelo T. de Alvear and his wife were very fond of Quinquela Mart\u00edn's works, and this admiration led to a lasting friendship. In 1922, Quinquela Mart\u00edn was assigned as chancellor of the Argentine Madrid Consulate in Spain. In April 1923 he exhibited at the C\u00edrculo de Bellas Artes of Madrid. Two of his works were acquired by the institution (Buque en reparaci\u00f3n and Efecto de Sol), while another two were acquired by the Museum of Modern Art of Madrid. In 1925 he set sail for France because--in his own words--\"My trip to France is owed to President Alvear, who liked my work and wanted them to be judged by Paris\". The Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg acquired Tormenta en el astillero. In 1927 he left for New York City, where he arrived Benito on board the SS American Legion on January 17, 1928.

The Museum of Modern Art of Rome acquired several paintings which were chosen by Benito Mussolini during the display.
