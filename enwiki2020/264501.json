    "text": "Vicia faba, also known in the culinary sense as the broad bean, fava bean, or faba bean, is a species of flowering plant in the pea and bean family Fabaceae. It is of uncertain origin and widely cultivated as a crop for human consumption. It is also used as a cover crop. Varieties with smaller, harder seeds that are fed to horses or other animals are called field bean, tic bean or tick bean. Horse bean, Vicia faba var. equina Pers., is a variety recognized as an accepted name. Some people suffer from favism, a hemolytic response to the consumption of broad beans, a condition linked to a metabolism disorder known as G6PDD. Otherwise the beans, with the outer seed coat removed, can be eaten raw or cooked. In young plants, the outer seed coat can be eaten, and in very young plants, the seed pod can be eaten. ==Description== Worldwide broad bean production Vicia faba is a stiffly erect, annual plant tall, with two to four stems that are square in cross-section. The leaves are long, pinnate with 2\u20137 leaflets, and colored a distinct glaucous () grey-green color. Unlike most other vetches, the leaves do not have tendrils for climbing over other vegetation. The flowers are long with five petals; the standard petals are white, the wing petals are white with a black spot (true black, not deep purple or blue as is the case in many \"black\" colorings) and the keel petals are white. Crimson-flowered broad beans also exist, which were recently saved from extinction. The flowers have a strong sweet scent which is attractive to bees and other pollinators.NSW Agriculture 2002 - Honeybees in faba bean pollination The fruit is a broad, leathery pod that is green, but matures to a dark blackish-brown, with a densely downy surface; the wild species has pods that are long and 1 cm diameter, but many modern cultivars developed for food use have pods long and 2\u20133 cm thick. Each bean pod contains 3\u20138 seeds that are round to oval and have a 5\u201310 mm diameter in the wild plant, but are usually flattened and up to 20\u201325 mm long, 15 mm broad and 5\u201310 mm thick in food cultivars. V. faba has a diploid (2n) chromosome number of 12 (six homologous pairs). Five pairs are acrocentric chromosomes and one pair is metacentric. ==Cultivation== Broad beans in the pod Broad beans have a long tradition of cultivation in Old World agriculture, being among the most ancient plants in cultivation and also among the easiest to grow. Along with lentils, peas, and chickpeas, they are believed to have become part of the eastern Mediterranean diet around 6000 BCE or earlier. They are still often grown as a cover crop to prevent erosion because they can overwinter and, as a legume, they fix nitrogen in the soil. The broad bean has high plant hardiness; it can withstand harsh and cold climates. Unlike most legumes, the broad bean can be grown in soils with high salinity, as well as in clay soil. However, it prefers rich loams. In much of the English-speaking world, the name \"broad bean\" is used for the large-seeded cultivars grown for human food, while \"horse bean\" and \"field bean\" refer to cultivars with smaller, harder seeds that are more like the wild species and used for animal feed, though their stronger flavour is preferred in some human food recipes, such as falafel. The term \"fava bean\" (from for the bean) is used in some English- speaking countries such as the US, but \"broad bean\" is the most common name in Commonwealth countries like the UK, Australia and New Zealand. ==Pests and diseases == Broad bean plants are highly susceptible to early summer infestations of the black bean aphid, which can cover large sections of growing plants with infestations, typically starting at the tip of the plant. Severe infestations can significantly reduce yields, and can also cause discolouration of pods and reduction in their saleable values. Faba bean rust is a fungal pathogen commonly affecting broad bean plants at maturity, causing small orange dots with yellow halos on the leaves, which may merge to form an orange lawn on both leaf surfaces. Beans are also attacked by chocolate spot fungus, which can have a severe impact on yield. In mainland Europe and North Africa, the plant parasite Orobanche crenata (carnation-scented broomrape) can cause severe impacts on fields of broad beans, devastating their yields. ==Nutrition== Raw mature fava beans are 11% water, 58% carbohydrates, 26% protein, and 2% fat. A 100 gram reference amount supplies 341 calories and numerous essential nutrients in high content (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV). Folate (106% DV) and dietary minerals, such as manganese, phosphorus, magnesium, and iron (range of DV 52 to 77%), have considerable content (table). B vitamins have moderate to rich content (19 to 48% DV; table). == Health concerns== ===Toxicity=== Beans generally contain phytohaemagglutinin, a substance that occurs naturally in plants, animals and humans. The relatively low toxin concentrations found in V. faba can be largely destroyed by boiling the beans for 10 minutes. ===Genetic predispositon=== Sufferers of favism must avoid broad beans, as they contain the alkaloid glycoside vicine and may initiate a hemolytic crisis. Broad beans are rich in tyramine, and thus should be avoided by those taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors. ==Culinary uses== Broad beans, shelled and steamed Vicia faba beans around a US quarter Fried broad beans as a snack Broad beans are generally eaten while still young and tender, enabling harvesting to begin as early as the middle of spring for plants started under glass or overwintered in a protected location, but even the main crop sown in early spring will be ready from mid to late summer. Horse beans, left to mature fully, are usually harvested in the late autumn, and are then eaten as a pulse. The immature pods are also cooked and eaten, and the young leaves of the plant can also be eaten, either raw or cooked as a pot herb (like spinach). Preparing broad beans involves first removing the beans from their pods, then steaming or boiling the beans, either whole or after parboiling them to loosen their exterior coating, which is then removed. The beans can be fried, causing the skin to split open, and then salted and/or spiced to produce a savory, crunchy snack. ===Algeria=== In south Algerian cuisine, broad beans are used to make Besarah and Doubara. Doubara is popular in the city of Biskra. ===China=== In the Sichuan cuisine of China, broad beans are combined with soybeans and chili peppers to produce a spicy fermented bean paste called doubanjiang. Perhaps due to the bean's popularity in Sichuan cuisine, in addition to the regular Chinese terms of \"silkworm bean\" (\u8695\u8c46 c\u00e1nd\u00f2u) or \"orchid bean\" (\u5170\u82b1\u8c46 l\u00e1nhu\u0101d\u00f2u), they are also known as \"Sichuan beans\" (\u5ddd\u8c46 chu\u0101nd\u00f2u) in Chinese. ===Colombia=== Fava beans (Colombia: Haba(s)) are a common food in most regions of Colombia, mostly in Bogota and Boyac\u00e1. === Ecuador === Steamed fava beans (known as habitas) with cheese are common in the cold-weather regions of Ecuador, especially around the Andes mountains and surroundings of Ambato. ===Egypt=== Fava beans ( ' ) are a common staple food in the Egyptian diet, eaten by rich and poor alike. Egyptians eat fava beans in various ways: they may be shelled and then dried, bought dried and then cooked by adding water in very low heat for several hours, etc. They are the primary ingredient in falafel. The most popular way of preparing them in Egypt is by taking the mashed, cooked beans and adding oil, salt and cumin to them. The dish, known as ful medames, is traditionally eaten with bread (generally at breakfast) and is considered the Egyptian national dish. ===Ethiopia=== Broad beans (Amharic: baqella) are one of the most popular legumes in Ethiopia. They are tightly coupled with every aspect of Ethiopian life. They are mainly used as an alternative to peas to prepare a flour called shiro, which is used to make shiro wot (a stew used widely in Ethiopian dishes). During the fasting period in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church tradition called Tsome Filliseta, Tsome arbe\u00e5, Tsome Tahsas, and Tsome Hawaria (which are in August, end of February\u2013April, mid-November\u2013beginning of January and June\u2013July), two uncooked spicy vegetable dishes are made using broad beans. The first is Hilibet, a thin, white paste of broad bean flour mixed with pieces of onion, green pepper, garlic, and other spices based on personal taste. The second is siljo, a fermented, sour, spicy thin yellow paste of broad bean flour. Both are served with other stews and injera (a pancake-like bread) during lunch and dinner. Baqella nifro (boiled broad beans) are eaten as a snack during some holidays and during a time of mourning. This tradition goes well into religious holidays, too. On the Thursday before Good Friday, in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church tradition tselote hamus (the Prayer of Thursday), people eat a different kind of nifro called gulban. Gulban is made of peeled, half beans collected and well cooked with other grains such as wheat, peas and chickpeas. This is done to mourn the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Boq'ullit (boiled salted broad beans embryo) is one of the favorite snacks in the evening, the common story-telling time in north and central Ethiopia. It is particularly a favorite for the story-teller (usually a society elder), as it is delicious, and easy to chew and swallow. Ripe broad beans are eaten by passers-by. Besides that, they are one of the gift items from a countryside relative in a period close to the Ethiopian Epiphany. ===Greece=== The Greek word f\u00e1va (\u03c6\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1) does not refer to broad beans, but to the yellow split pea and also to another legume, known as Lathyrus clymenum. Broad beans are known instead as kouki\u00e1 (), and are eaten in a stew combined with artichokes, while they are still fresh in their pods. Dried broad beans are eaten boiled, sometimes combined with garlic sauce (skordalia). In Crete, fresh broad beans are shelled and eaten as a companion to tsikoudia, the local alcoholic drink. Favism is quite common in Greece because of malaria endemicity in previous centuries, and people afflicted by it do not eat broad beans. ===India=== In India, fava beans are eaten in the Northeastern state of Manipur. They are locally known as hawai-amubi and are ingredients in the dish eromba. ===Iran=== Broad beans, or \"Baghalee\" (Persian: \u0628\u0627\u0642\u0627\u0644\u06cc) are primarily cultivated in the central and north parts of Iran. The city of Kashan has the highest production of broad beans with high quality in terms of the taste, cooking periods and color. However, broad beans have a very short season (roughly two weeks). The season is usually in the middle of spring. When people have access to fresh beans in season, they cook them in brine and then add vinegar and Heracleum persicum depending on taste. They also make an extra amount to dry to be used year-round. The dried beans can be cooked with rice, which forms one of the most famous dishes in north of Iran (Gilan) called baghalee polo (Persian: \u0628\u0627\u0642\u0627\u0644\u06cc \u067e\u0644\u0648) which means \"rice with broad beans\". In Iran broad beans are cooked, served with Golpar-origan and salt and sold on streets in the winter. This food is also available preserved in metal cans. ===Iraq=== Broad beans which are called Bagilla (\u0628\u0627\u06af\u0644\u0647/\u0628\u0627\u0642\u0644\u0647) in the Iraqi dialect of Arabic are a common ingredient in many Iraqi foods. One of the most popular Iraqi dishes that uses the broad bean is Bagilla Bil-Dihin (\u0628\u0627\u06af\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0647\u0646) also called Tishreeb Bagilla (\u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0628 \u0628\u0627\u06af\u0644\u0647). This dish is a common breakfast dish in Iraq and consists of bread soaked in boiled broad beans\u2019 water then topped with broad beans, melted Ghee, and often also a boiled or fried egg. Fool (\u0641\u0648\u0644) is another common breakfast dish in Iraq as well as many other Arab countries and consists of mashed fava beans. Another famous Iraqi dish is Timmen Bagilla (\u062a\u0645\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u06af\u0644\u0647), which is Arabic for 'broad bean rice'. This classic Iraqi dish consists of rice cooked with broad bean and dill. ===Italy=== In Rome, fava beans are popular either cooked with guanciale or with globe artichokes, as side dish together with lamb or kid, or raw with Pecorino romano.

Even today, the word koukia (\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03ba\u03b9\u03ac) is used unofficially, referring to the votes. Beans were used as a food for the dead, such as during the annual Lemuria festival. * The ancient Roman family name Fabia and the modern political term Fabian derive from this particular bean. * The Pythagoreans were forbidden from ever eating, mentioning, or looking at beans. * Both Porphyry and Iamblichus report that Pythagoras once persuaded a bull not to eat beans * In Ubykh culture, throwing beans on the ground and interpreting the pattern in which they fall was a common method of divination (favomancy), and the word for \"bean-thrower\" in that language has become a generic term for seers and soothsayers in general. * The colloquial expression 'not worth a hill of beans' alludes to their widespread economy and association with the peasant diet. * In Italy, broad beans are traditionally sown on November 2, All Souls Day. Small cakes made in the shape of broad beans (though not out of them) are known as fave dei morti or \"beans of the dead\". According to tradition, Sicily once experienced a failure of all crops other than the beans; the beans kept the population from starvation, and thanks were given to Saint Joseph. Broad beans subsequently became traditional on Saint Joseph's Day altars in many Italian communities. Some people carry a broad bean for good luck; some believe that if one carries a broad bean, one will never be without the essentials of life. In Rome, on the first of May, Roman families traditionally eat fresh fava beans with Pecorino Romano cheese during a daily excursion in the Campagna. In northern Italy, on the contrary, fava beans are traditionally fed to animals - and so some people, especially the elderly, might frown on human consumption. But in Liguria, a maritime region near northern Italy, fava beans are loved raw, and consumed fresh in early spring as the first product of the garden, alone or with fresh Pecorino Sardo or with local salami from Sant'Olcese. In some Central Italian regions, a once-popular and recently rediscovered fancy food is the bagiana, a soup of fresh or dried fava beans seasoned with onions and beet leaves stir-fried, before being added to the soup, in olive oil and lard (or bacon or cured ham fat). * In Portugal and Spain a Christmas cake called bolo Rei in Portuguese and rosc\u00f3n de reyes in Spanish (King's cake) is baked with a fava bean inside. Whoever eats the slice containing it, is supposed to buy next year's cake. * A similar tradition exists in France, where the f\u00e8ve (originally a dried bean, but often now a small china or metal trinket) is placed in the galette des rois; the person who finds it in their slice becomes the king or queen of the meal, and is often expected to serve the other guests to drink. * Pliny claimed they acted as a laxative. * European folklore also claims that planting beans on Good Friday or during the night brings good luck. *Frederick E Rose (London) Ltd v William H Pim Junior & Co Ltd [1953] 2 QB 450, is an English contract law case where the two litigants had both mistaken feveroles for ordinary horse beans. * Can be used as a green manure, due to nitrogen fixation it produces. * In the Netherlands, roasted or fried broad beans are regarded as a local delicacy of the city of Groningen, and is locally called molleboon. Until the 1800s, the city council used mollebonen for the voting process, sometimes real beans, sometimes made of stone or clay. The word Molleboon became a nickname for the inhabitants of the city. ==Gallery== File:Vicia faba.jpg|Broad bean flowers File:Crimson BB1.jpg|Crimson flowered broad beans File:Vicia faba, broad bean seed showing outer seed coating.jpg|Seed of raw broad bean removed and set next to intact seed File:Tuinboon voor zaad.jpg|Mature broad bean pods File:Aphis fabae, zwarte bonenluis.jpg|Aphis fabae (aphids) on broad bean == See also == * ** * == References == == External links == * Vicia faba at Purdue University * Alternative Field Crops Manual at Purdue University faba Category:Flora of North Africa Category:Edible legumes Category:Medicinal plants Category:Nitrogen-fixing crops Category:Phytoremediation plants Category:Flora of Nepal Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ",
