    "text": "The 2017 Scotties Tournament of Hearts was held from February 16 to 26 at the Meridian Centre in St. Catharines, Ontario. The Rachel Homan rink, representing Ontario, won their third national title; with Homan becoming the youngest skip, man or woman, to ever win three national championships. Her team represented Canada at the 2017 World Women's Curling Championship in Beijing from March 18 to 26. ==Teams== The 2017 Scotties was notable for the presence of many veteran skips from previous Canadian Women's Championship tournaments. Shannon Kleibrink made her 5th Scotties appearance after defeating the 2-time Scotties Silver Medalist Valerie Sweeting in the Alberta final; however, issues with back pain limited her performance. Marla Mallett of British Columbia and Stacie Curtis of Newfoundland and Labrador made their 4th Scotties appearances, as well as Mary Mattatall who was in her 5th as Team Nova Scotia after upsetting last year's Nova Scotia Champion Jill Brothers. PEI's Robyn MacPhee made her 8th Scotties appearance, \u00c8ve B\u00e9lisle of Quebec made her 3rd, and Kerry Galusha of the Northwest Territories made her 14th Scotties appearance. Geneva Chislett returned again for Team Nunavut, as did Sarah Koltun for the Yukon. The only two teams to make their Scotties debuts were Penny Barker of Saskatchewan and Melissa Adams of New Brunswick. Notably absent was the 5-time Scotties Champion and 12-time Manitoba Scotties champion, Jennifer Jones, who was defeated in the Manitoba Scotties Semifinal by Darcy Robertson, who lost to Michelle Englot (9-time Saskatchewan Scotties Champion) in the final. The headline teams for this year's Scotties were last year's Silver Medalist Krista McCarville who defeated Tracy Fleury in Northern Ontario for the second year in a row, the 2-time Scotties Champion Rachel Homan who won the southern Ontario final against Jacqueline Harrison, and the defending Champions Chelsea Carey of Team Canada.
