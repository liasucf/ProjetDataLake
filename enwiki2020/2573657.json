As the Prince He peerage was not awarded \"iron-cap\" status, this meant that each successive bearer of the title would normally start off with a title downgraded by one rank vis-\u00e0-vis that held by his predecessor. However, the title would generally not be downgraded to any lower than a feng'en fuguo gong except under special circumstances. The first bearer of the title was Hongzhou (1712\u20131770), the fifth son of the Yongzheng Emperor. In 1733, he was awarded the status of a qinwang (prince of the first rank) by his father under the title \"Prince He of the First Rank\". The title was passed down over seven generations and was held by eight persons. ==Members of the Prince He peerage== Hongzhou (1712\u20131770), the first Prince He * Hongzhou (1712\u20131770), the Yongzheng Emperor's fifth son, held the title Prince He of the First Rank from 1733 to 1770, posthumously honoured as Prince Hegong of the First Rank (\u548c\u606d\u89aa\u738b) ** Yongbi (\u6c38\u74a7;
