    "text": "Noah is the second studio album by American rock band The Bob Seger System, released in September 1969 (see 1969 in music). Seger was displeased with this album as it was the label's intention to showcase Tom Neme as the voice of the band. Seger contemplated quitting music altogether after this album. It has never been reissued on a legitimate U.S. CD by Capitol and probably never will be, as Seger disavows it. It does, however, contain the classic Seger title song, Noah, which was issued as a single in July 1969. The album features the song \"Death Row,\" which was a holdover from the Ramblin' Gamblin' Man sessions. It was originally issued as the b-side of the single 2 + 2 = ?. The song is significant for being considered one of many songs released in the late 1960s that set the foundation for heavier styles of rock, such as heavy metal. __NOTOC__ ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ;The Bob Seger System *Bob Seger - guitar, rhythm guitar, vocals *Dan Honaker - bass, guitar, vocals *Tom Neme - guitar, piano, rhythm guitar, keyboard, vocals *Pep Perrine - percussion, drums, vocals *Bob Schultz - organ, piano, keyboard, saxophone, vocals, background vocals ==Production== *Engineer: Jim Bruzzese ==References== Category:Bob Seger albums Category:1969 albums Category:Albums produced by Punch Andrews Category:Capitol Records albums ",
