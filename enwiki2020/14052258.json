Entertainment Weekly gave the series an \"A-\" rating, and critic Ken Tucker remarked favorably on its avoidance of clich\u00e9, self-consciousness, and agenda-driven storytelling, and praised its execution, nuance, and verisimilitude. Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote: \"the seven-part Generation Kill is what you'd hope for from the people behind The Wire: an honest, barely adorned, sometimes painfully vivid representation of life as we live it now. It's journalism converted to art, with both benefiting\". Austin Smith of the New York Post, however, was not as impressed; he described the series \"as dull and throbbing as a severe headache\". A red carpet screening of Generation Kill was held for U.S. Marines at Camp Pendleton in California, where the series was favorably received. On Rotten Tomatoes, the miniseries has an approval rating of 86% based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 9.1/10. The critical consensus reads, \"Generation Kill plunges the viewer into war with a visceral force that's still somehow reined in by masterful storytelling and a strong command of period details.\" ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2008 television films Category:Iraq War in television Category:War television series Category:2000s American television miniseries Category:Television shows about the United States Marine Corps Category:HBO original programming Category:Television shows written by David Simon Category:Television series by All3Media Category:Television shows set in Iraq Category:American military television series ",
