Some of Kharaosta's known coins write Ortas instead of Artas. Scholars state that Yuvaraja Kharaosta Kamuio of the Lion Capital Inscriptions is the same as Kshatrapa Kharaosta, whose coins have been studied by Dr Rapson and Dr Luders. It is now generally agreed that Kshatrapa Kharaosta was son Arta, and that Yuvaraja Kharaosta and Kshatrapa Kharaosta were one and same historical personage.Kshatrapasa pra Kharaostasa Artasa putrasa (i.e. Kshatrapa Kharaosta, son of Arta), Political History of ancient India, 1996, p 397/98, Dr Raychaudhury; See also: History and Culture of Indian People, The age of Imperial Unity, p 164, (Editors) Dr R.

See also: . An older view was that Arta, the father of Kharaosta, was the first husband of Rajuvula's chief queen who had married Rajuvula after Arta's death. However, Dr S Konow does not accept this view. The fact that last name Kamuia has been used both by Yuvaraja Kharaosta as well as by princess Aiyasi clearly proves that Aiyasi Kamuia was the daughter and not mother of Yuvaraja Kharaosta Kamuio, since it is the father's and not mother's lineage which is adopted by their off-springs.Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, Vol II, part I, p 36 & xxxvi, Dr Stein Konow; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, 1990, p 141, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland; Pr\u0101c\u012bna Kamboja, jana aura janapada =: Ancient Kamboja, people and country, 1981, p 227/228, Dr Jiy\u0101l\u0101la K\u0101mboja, Dr Satyavrat \u015a\u0101str\u012b. It appears that Arta (Artas, Ortas) had died before the date of writing of the Mathura Lion Capital inscriptions. Yuvaraja Kharaosta Kamuio, therefore, was the legitimate inheritor to the position as King of Kings for the kingdom of Gandhara after king Moga.See: Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, Vol II, part I, p 36 & xxxvi, Dr Stein Konow; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, 1990, p 141, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland; Pr\u0101c\u012bna Kamboja, jana aura janapada =: Ancient Kamboja, people and country, 1981, p 227/228, Dr Jiy\u0101l\u0101la K\u0101mboja, Dr Satyavrat \u015a\u0101str\u012b; Political History of Ancient India, 1996, p 397, Dr H. C. Raychaudhury. Saka governor Rajuvula had married princess Aiyasi Kamuia, daughter of Yuvaraja Kharaosta Kamuio, probably to strengthen his political position and also his claim to the throne (of Taxila).Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, Vol II, Part I, p 36 & xxxvi; Ancient India, 1956, p 220, Dr Radha Kumud Mookerji; Pr\u0101c\u012bna Kamboja, jana aura janapada =: Ancient Kamboja, people and country, 1981, p 227/228, Dr Jiy\u0101l\u0101la K\u0101mboja, Dr Satyavrat \u015a\u0101str\u012b; See quote in: Early Inscriptions of Mathur\u0101: A Study, 1980, p 27, K. Das. This prospect was obviously not liked by other Saka chiefs. This appears to be the reason as to why the title of Shahanshahi was discontinued and only the titles of Kshatrapa and Mahakshtarpa obtained among the Sakas from that time onwards.Pr\u0101c\u012bna Kamboja, jana aura janapada =: Ancient Kamboja, people and country, 1981, p 227/228, Dr Jiy\u0101l\u0101la K\u0101mboja, Dr Satyavrat \u015a\u0101str\u012b. These Sakas later organized a Samgha under Rajuvula and Patika when Rajuvula assumed the title of Maha- Ksatrapa for the first time. It appears, for some reasons, that Yuvaraja Kharaosta Kamuio did not avail the position of King of Kings after Moga's death. Many scholars including Sten Konow, H. W. Bailey, R. K. Mukerjee, K. P. Jaiswal, J. L. Kamboj, Buddha Prakash and others recognise that the names Kamuia and Kamuio (q.v) of the Mathura Lion Capital Inscriptions are the Kharoshthi/Prakritic forms of Sanskrit/Pali Kambojika or Kamboja.Khroshthi Inscriptions, No 15, A3; Notes on Indo-Scythian chronology, Journal of Indian History, xii, 21; Corpus Inscrioptionum Indicarum, Vol II, Part I, pp xxxvi, 36, Dr. S. Konow e.g: \"If we bear in mind that 'mb' becomes 'm', i.e mm in the dialect of the Kharoshthi Dhammapada and that common 'o' becomes 'u' as in Sudasa, then Kamuia may very well represent Sanskrit Kambojika\" (Dr Konow); cf: \"The Kamuiyas, who are associated with the family of the Saka Mahakshatrapa Rajuvula of the Mathura Lion Capital inscriptions, are in fact, the Kambojas, Kamuias being just the form we would expect in the dialect for an old Kambojika\" (Indian Culture, 1934, p 193, Indian Research Institute); Cf: \"Dr Stein Konow\u2019s recognition of Kamuia, occurring in the Lion Capital Inscription of Mathura, as = Kambojika is convincing\u201d\u2026See: Bihar and Orissa Research Society, Vol XVI, 1930, part III and IV, p 229, Dr K.

Hence according to one school of scholars, king Maues, his brother Arta, Kharaosta Kamuio and Kharaosta's daughter Aiyasi Kamuia --- all belonged to the Kambojika or Kamboja clan or lineage.Refs: Corpus Inscrioptionum Indicarum, Vol II, Part I, pp xxxvi, 36, S Konow: \"I shall only add that if Kharoshtha and his father Arta were Kambojas, the same may have been the case with Moga, and we understand why the Kambojas are sometimes mentioned with the Sakas and Yavanas\" ( Dr S Konow); Ancient India, pp 320-21, Dr R.

According to its editor Dr Richard Salomon (University of Washington), king Kharayosta of the \"Inscribed Silver Buddhist Reliquary\", in all probability, is the same Kharaosta who finds reference as Yuvaraja Kharosta in the Mathura Lion Capital inscriptions as well as, as Kharaostasa or Kharahostes in the coins.An Inscribed Silver Buddhist Reliquary of the Time of King Kharaosta and Prince Indravarman, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 116, No. 3 (Jul. - Sep., 1996), pp. 418-452, Richard Salomon == Notes == == External links == * Mathura Lion Capital Inscriptions * The Early Kushan Kings: New Evidence for Chronology: Para (63) == See also == *Kamuia *Aiyasi Kamuia *Kharaosta Kamuio *Maues *Kambojas *Kamboja *Parama-Kambojas *Rishikas == References == *Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, Vol II, part I, Dr Stein Konow *Journal of Bihar and Orissa Research society, Vol XVI, 1930, parts III, IV, Dr K.
