    "text": "Jimmy Zambrano (born November 2, 1966 in Guamal, Magdalena), is a Colombian accordion player. Born in Colombia, he left at an early age for Caracas, Venezuela, where he studied music and specialized in piano. There, he was called by Los Mel\u00f3dicos of Renato Capriles to record a vallenato song by Poncho Zuleta titled \"Luzmila,\" which became the first song and recording by this artist. In 1993, he recorded an album called \"Vallenato y m\u00e1s\" with the group \"Los Cl\u00e1sicos,\" alongside An\u00edbal Caicedo and Jair Casta\u00f1eda. In 1995, Omar Geles discovered his talent in a tour in Venezuela and invited him to belong to Los Diablitos as keyboard player, with whom he performed until 1999. During his time with Los Diablitos, he produced and arranged various music genres and formed a vallenato ensemble known as \"Los Emigrantes,\" with An\u00edbal Caidedo. In 1999, he started playing with Jorge Celed\u00f3n, who had just left the Binomio de Oro de Am\u00e9rica. Together, they recorded 9 albums, earning international acclaim. With Celed\u00f3n, he won a Latin Grammy in 2007 in the Cumbia Vallenato category. In 2012, the duo broke up as the result of disagreements. In 2013, Zambrano met Dub\u00e1n Bayona, another ex-Binomio de Oro performer, with whom he released a first album called M\u00e9tete en el viaje, which has received favorable reviews. == Discography == === An\u00edbal Caicedo (Los Emigrantes) === * Un Nuevo Sendero - FM Discos y Cintas - 1997 * Que Hable El Alma - FM Discos y Cintas - 1998 === Jorge Celed\u00f3n === * Rom\u00e1ntico como yo - Sony Music - 2000 * Ll\u00e9vame en tus sue\u00f1os - Sony Music - 2001 * Canto vallenato - Sony Music - 2002 * \u00a1Juepa je! - Sony Music - 2004 * Grande \u00e9xitos en vivo - Sony Music - 2005 * Son...
