    "text": "The Ban\u016b Khuza\u02bdah ( singular Khuz\u0101\u02bd\u012b) is the name of an Azdite, Qa\u1e25\u1e6d\u0101nite tribe, which is one of the main ancestral tribes of the Arabian Peninsula. They ruled Mecca for a long period, prior and after the Prophet Muhammad's rule, and many members of the tribe now live in and around that city, but are also present in significant numbers in other countries, mainly Iraq, Israel, Palestine, and Jordan but also numbers can be found in Lebanon, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and UAE. The tribe acted as the custodians of Mecca alongside the Prophet Muhammad and its members were his personal guardians throughout. Most notably, in Iraq, the tribe was the creator of the Abbasid Empire, one of the greatest in history, as well as the founders of the city of Baghdad. They were the ruling kings of the Emirate of what is now modern-day Iraq, until the invasion of the Ottoman Empire in the late 1800s and were the rulers of the kingdom of the Middle Euphrates until the early-mid 20th century. ==During Muhammad's era== They participated in the Battle of the Trench. The Banu Nadir began rousing the nomads of Najd. The Nadir enlisted the Banu Ghatafan by paying them half of their harvest.Nomani, Sirat al-Nabi, p. 368-370.Watt, Muhammad at Medina, p. 34-37. This contingent, the second largest, added a strength of about 2,000 men and 300 horsemen led by Unaina bin Hasan Fazari. The Bani Assad also agreed to join, led by Tuleha Asadi.al- Halabi, al-Sirat al-Halbiyyah, p. 19. From the Banu Sulaym, the Nadir secured 700 men, though this force would likely have been much larger had not some of its leaders been sympathetic towards Islam. The Bani Amir, who had a pact with Muhammad, refused to join.Lings, Muhammad: his life based on the earliest sources, pp. 215f. Other tribes included the Banu Murra, with 400 men led by Hars ibn Auf Murri, and the Banu Shuja, with 700 men led by Sufyan ibn Abd Shams. In total, the strength of the Confederate armies, though not agreed upon by scholars, is estimated to have included around 10,000 men and six hundred horsemen. At the end of March 627 the army, which was led by Abu Sufyan, marched on Medina.Rodinson, Muhammad: Prophet of Islam, p. 208. In accordance with the plan the armies began marching towards Medina, Meccans from the south (along the coast) and the others from the east. At the same time horsemen from the Banu Khuza'a left to warn Medina of the invading army. ==The Lineage of Ban\u016b Khuz\u0101'ah== Most traditionalists trace the origins of the tribe to Amr ibn Lu\u1e25ay al-Khuz\u0101'\u012b, and agree that, with the other branches of the Azd, they at some point, left Yemen and moved north. 'Amr ibn Lu\u1e25ay and his clan settled themselves around Mecca. A date of around the 5th century can be set for that settlement, although traditionalists place it at an earlier date by giving particularly long lives to some of its leaders. The opinions of genealogists vary concerning the ancestry and origins of the Banu Khuza'ah; some say that they were descended from Qahtan and others say they are from Adnan. We will present both opinions here: === The first group === Al-Mubarrid was of the opinion that Khuz\u0101\u2019ah are descendants of \u2018Amr bin Rab\u012b\u2019ah, and he was known as Lu\u1e25ay and belonged to the Azd; Ibn al-Ath\u012br al-Jazar\u012b agrees with him, saying: \u201cThey were called Khuz\u0101\u2019ah because they broke away from the Azd when they all left Yemen at the time of the flood of \u02c1Iram\u201d (the breach of the Ma\u2019rib dam).\u2019Izz al-D\u012bn Ibn al-Ath\u012br al-Jazar\u012b: Al-Lub\u0101b fi Tahdh\u012bb al-Ans\u0101b. Vol.1; pg. 439. D\u0101r S\u0101dir, Beirut 1983. Y\u0101q\u016bt al-\u1e24amaw\u012b says the same, but states that they are Qa\u1e25\u1e6d\u0101nites.Y\u0101q\u016bt bin \u2018Abdull\u0101h al-Hamaw\u012b: Al-Muqta\u1e11ab min Kit\u0101b Jamharat al-Nasab. 1st ed. Pg. 230. Ed. N\u0101j\u012b \u1e24asan, Iraq 1987. Al- Qalqashand\u012b states: \u201cKhuz\u0101\u2019ah are a tribe from the Azd, from the Qa\u1e25\u1e6d\u0101nites.\u201dAb\u016b al-\u2018Abb\u0101s A\u1e25mad al-Qalqashand\u012b: Nih\u0101yat al-Adab f\u012b Ma\u2019rifat Ans\u0101b al-\u2018Arab. Vol 2. Pg. 244. Ed. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm al-Aby\u0101r\u012b. Beirut 1980 Ibn \u2018Abd al-Birr states that ibn al-Kalb\u012b was of the opinion that:\u201d 'Amr bin Lu\u1e25ay, for Lu\u1e25ay was his name, is Rab\u012b\u2019ah ibn \u1e24\u0101rithah bin \u2018Amr; and he is M\u0101\u2019 al-Sam\u0101\u2019 ibn \u1e24\u0101rithah bin Imra\u2019 al-Qays bin Tha\u2019labah bin M\u0101zin bin al-Azd bin Ghawth bin al-N\u0101bit bin M\u0101lik bin Zayd bin Ka\u1e25l\u0101n bin Saba\u2019 bin Yashjab bin Ya\u2019rab bin Qa\u1e25\u1e6d\u0101n, so he is the ancestor of all of Khuz\u0101\u2019ah, and they broke away from him.\"Ibn \u2018Abd al-Birr: Al-Anb\u0101h \u2018ala Qab\u0101\u2019il al-Ruw\u0101h. Pg. 82. It is suggested that one of the strongest proofs for this is that the Khuz\u0101\u2019ah themselves used to say: \u201cWe are the sons of \u2018Amr ibn Rab\u012b\u2019ah from the Yemen.\u201dIbn Hish\u0101m, Al- S\u012brat al-Nabaw\u012byah, Pt.1, pg. 91. Arabs linguists tended towards the opinion that the name of Khuz\u0101\u2019ah came from the phrase: khaza\u2019a \u2018an a\u1e63\u1e25\u0101bihi (\u062e\u0632\u0639 \u0639\u0646 \u0623\u0635\u062d\u0627\u0628\u0647 ), which means \"he has lagged behind his companions (when they are walking)\"; so they were called this because they were behind their people when they came from Ma\u2019rib.Ism\u0101\u2019\u012bl ibn \u1e24amm\u0101d al-Jawhar\u012b: Al-Si\u1e25\u1e25\u0101\u1e25.

Vol.1, pg. 142. Ed. By Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24\u0101mid al-Faq\u012b. Beirut, 2nd ed. 1986. ===The second group=== Ibn I\u1e63\u1e25aq is of the opinion that Khuz\u0101\u2019ah are the descendants of \u2018Amr ibn Lu\u1e25ay bin Qum\u2019ah bin Ily\u0101s bin Mu\u1e11ar bin Naz\u0101r bin Ma\u2019d bin \u2018Adn\u0101n;Hish\u0101m bin Muhammad al-S\u0101\u2019ib al-Kalb\u012b: Jamharat al-Nasab. Pg. 17. Ed. Naji \u1e24asan 1st ed. Beirut 1407. they would therefore be Mu\u1e11arites rather than Qa\u1e25\u1e6danites. Al-Mu\u1e63\u2019ab al-Zubayri also agrees with Ibn I\u1e63\u1e25aq, saying that Qum\u2019ah is \u2018Umayr, father of Khuz\u0101\u2019ah.Al-Mu\u1e63\u2019ab bin \u2018Abdull\u0101h al- Zubayr\u012b: Nasab Quraysh, pg. 7. Ed. E. Levi-Proven\u00e7al. 3rd ed. D\u0101r al-Ma\u2019\u0101rif, Cairo, Egypt. This is supported by the opinion of Ibn \u1e24azm, who related four prophetic traditions (\u1e24ad\u012bth) substantiating that Khuz\u0101\u2019ah were from Mu\u1e11ar and not from Qa\u1e25\u1e6d\u0101n:Ibn \u1e24azm al-Andalus\u012b: Jamharat Ans\u0101b al-\u2018Arab. Vol.1, pg. 233. \u1e24ad\u012bth 1: From Ab\u016b Hurayrah that Muhammad said: \u201c\u2019Amr ibn Lu\u1e25ay bin Qum\u2019ah bin Khandaf is the father of Khuz\u0101\u2019ah.\u201dIbn \u1e24ajar: Fat\u1e25 al-Bar\u012b. \u1e24ad\u012bth No. 3520; vol. 6; pg. 632. \u1e24ad\u012bth 2: The statement of Muhammad: \u201cI saw \u2018Amr bin Lu\u1e25ay bin Qum\u2019ah bin Khandaf the father of those sons of Ka\u2019b, and he was dragging his intestines through hellfire.\u201dIbn \u1e24azm: Jamharat Ans\u0101b al-\u2018Arab. Vol. 1 Pg.234. And those sons of Ka\u2019b are the ones about whom Ibn 'Abb\u0101s said: \u201cThe Quran was sent down in the dialect of Ka\u2019bs: Ka\u2019b bin Ka\u2019b bin Lu\u2019ayy and Ka\u2019b bin 'Amr bin Lu\u1e25ay.\u201dMu\u1e25ammad bin Ab\u016b Bakr al-Tilims\u0101n\u012b: Al-Jawharah f\u012b Nasab al-Nab\u012b wa A\u1e63\u1e25\u0101bih.

I saw Rab\u012b\u2019ah ibn Lu\u1e25ay bin Qum\u2019ah bin Khandaf dragging his intestines in the fire, and I have never seen any man more like him than you; nor more like you than him.\u201d Aktham asked: \u201cAre you afraid that being like him will harm me, o Messenger of Allah?\u201d And he replied: \u201dNo, you are a believer and he was an unbeliever \u2026\u201dIbn Kath\u012br: Tafs\u012br Ibn Kath\u012br, vol. 3; pg. 107. And al-Mu\u1e63\u2019ab al-Zubayr\u012b stood by this \u1e25ad\u012bth saying that whatever Muhammad said was the truth.Al-Mu\u1e63\u2019ab al-Zubayr\u012b: Nasab Quraysh, pg. 8. This is also supported by Ibn Khald\u016bn, who reiterates the statement of Q\u0101di \u2018Ayy\u0101\u1e11: \u201dWhat is well known about this Khuz\u0101\u2019ah is that he is \u2018Amr bin Lu\u1e25ay bin Qum\u2019ah bin Ily\u0101s.Ibn Khald\u016bn: Al-'Ibar wa Dawr\u0101n al-Mubtada\u2019 wa al-Khabar f\u012b Ayy\u0101m al-\u2018Arab wa al-\u2018Ajm wa al-Barbar wa man \u2018\u0100\u1e63irahum. Vol. 2, Pg. 332; Beirut 1982. \u1e24ad\u012bth 4: The \u1e25ad\u012bth of Salamah ibn al-Akw\u0101', who said: \u201cThe Messenger of Allah (SAW) passed by a group of people from the tribe of Aslam who were practicing archery.\u201c And he said to them: \u201dThrow Ban\u012b Ism\u0101\u2019\u012bl, for your father was an archer, and I am with the sons of such-and-such a one \u2026\u201dIbn \u1e24ajar: Fat\u1e25 al-B\u0101r\u012b, vol.6, pg. 107. \u1e24adith No. 2899. Ibn \u1e24azm said: \u201cNow as for the first, the third and the fourth \u1e25ad\u012bths, they are all extremely authentic and reliable, and they cannot be rejected for the statements of the genealogists and others; and on the basis of these Khuz\u0101\u2019ah was one of the sons of Qum\u2019ah bin Ily\u0101s bin Mu\u1e11ar. Al-Suhayl\u012b said that the \u1e25ad\u012bth of Salamah was a strong proof for those who considered Khuz\u0101\u2019ah to be one of the sons of Qum\u2019ah ibn Ily\u0101s.Al-Suhayl\u012b: Al-Raw\u1e11 al-Anf. Vol. 1, pg. 19. And there is not the slightest doubt that the difference between the different genealogists stems from the fact that Salamah mentioned in the fourth \u1e24ad\u012bth are the brothers of Khuz\u0101\u2019ah. And among the some more modern scholars who prefer to regard Khuz\u0101\u2019ah as one of the descendants of \u2018Adn\u0101n is 'All\u0101mah \u2018Abd al-Ra\u1e25m\u0101n bin Ya\u1e25y\u0101 al-Mu\u2019allam\u012b al-Yam\u0101n\u012b.Al-Sam\u2019\u0101n\u012b: Al-Ans\u0101b, vol. 5; pg. 108. ==Phratries (bu\u1e6d\u016bn)== In ancient times the tribe of Khuz\u0101\u2019ah was subdivided into a number of phratries (bu\u1e6d\u016bn): *Ban\u016b Kalb bin 'Amr **Ban\u016b Sal\u016bl bin 'Amr ***Ban\u016b \u1e24abshah bin Sal\u016bl ****Ban\u016b Qumayr bin \u1e24abshah ****Ban\u016b \u1e10\u0101\u1e6dar bin \u1e24abshah ****Ban\u016b \u1e24al\u012bl bin \u1e24abshah ****Ban\u016b Kulayb bin \u1e24abshah ***Ban\u016b \u02c1Add\u012b bin Sal\u016bl ****Ban\u016b \u1e24abtar bin \u02c1Add\u012b ****Ban\u016b Haynah bin \u02c1Add\u012b **Ban\u016b \u1e24abshah bin Ka'b ***Ban\u016b \u1e24ar\u0101m bin \u1e24abshah ***Ban\u016b Gh\u0101\u1e11irah bin \u1e24abshah **Ban\u016b Sa'd bin Ka'b **Ban\u016b M\u0101zin bin Ka'b *Ban\u016b \u02c1Add\u012b bin 'Amr *Ban\u016b Mal\u012b\u1e25 bin 'Amr: It is said that among them was Quraysh, one of the sons of al-\u1e62alt bin M\u0101lik bin al-Na\u1e11ar bin Kin\u0101nah\"Ibn \u1e24azm: Jamharat Ans\u0101b al-'Arab.

A number of other Arab tribes used to share these places with them, such as the Quraysh in Makkah, and Kin\u0101nah in Jabal al-Abw\u0101\u2019 and Murr al-\u1e92ahr\u0101n and Qudayd. The Arab tribes in general often used to move from one area to another in search of water, something that sometimes led to tribes sharing certain spots.

They settled in Mecca and in the area around. Once Ism\u0101\u2019\u012bl had become a youth he married a woman of the tribe of Jurhum.Ab\u016b Ja'far Mu\u1e25ammad bin Jar\u012br al-\u1e6cabar\u012b: T\u0101rikh al-Rusul wa al-Mul\u016bk.

Ism\u0101\u2019\u012bl was the custodian of the Sacred House (Ka\u2019bah), and after he died he made his son N\u0101bit his successor. And then after N\u0101bit the job was given to his uncles from Jurhum, and with them were the descendants of Ism\u0101\u2019\u012bl. Then Mu\u1e11\u0101\u1e11ah ibn 'Amr al-Jurham\u012b assumed the burden of the affairs of the Sacred House.Ibn Hish\u0101m: Al-S\u012brat al-Nabaw\u012byah. Part 1, pg.111. Jurhum's custodianship of the Sanctuary lasted for a period of time, but they then started to become weaker in faith, putting the continuing sanctity of the Sacred House at peril. They considered all the funds collected at the Sanctuary to be their property, and started to perform sinful acts within its precincts. It came to the point where a man and a woman, called As\u0101f and N\u0101\u2019ilah, performed coitus in the Sacred House, and according to the Muslim sources Allah turned them into two stones to punish them for this sacrilegious act.Ibn Hish\u0101m: Al-S\u012brat al-Nabaw\u012byah. Part 1, pg. 82. Their aggression against the sanctity of the Sanctuary was the catalyst that made the Ban\u016b Bakr bin \u2018Abd al-Man\u0101f bin Kin\u0101nah, descendants of Ism\u0101\u2019\u012bl, join with Khuz\u0101\u2019ah in fighting Jurhum and they expelled them from Mecca.'Abd al-Malik bin al-Qurayb al-A\u1e63ma'\u012b: T\u0101r\u012bkh al-'Arab Qabl al-Isl\u0101m. Pg. 96. Edited by Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24asan \u0100l Y\u0101s\u012bn, 1st. ed. Baghdad 1379 AH. After the Jurhumites had fled, Khuz\u0101\u2019ah became custodians of the Sacred House, passing the duty on from father to son for a long time, five hundred years it is said. The first one of Khuz\u0101\u2019ah to govern the Sacred House was \u2018Amr bin Rab\u012b\u2019ah (Lu\u1e25ay) who travelled to Syria-Palestine (al-Sh\u0101m) to seek a cure for a disease he was suffering from; he found the people there worshiping idols, and he liked this religion, so he brought back an idol called Hubal back to Mecca and called on the people to worship it. Hubal had the figure of an old man with a long beard and was made of carnelian. Its right hand had been cut off but the Quraysh would later provide it with a hand made of gold. 'Amr ibn Rab\u012b'ah then was the first to change the religion of the Arabs. Muslims historians consider that the people of Mecca were following the monotheistic religion of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm and Ism\u0101'\u012bl up to this point (see Hanif), when polytheism was introduced. 'Amr ibn Lu\u1e25ay became very famous among the other Arab tribes, because he fed all the pilgrims to the Sacred House, and distributed Yemeni cloaks to them. Many of the tribes started to visit Mecca on pilgrimage, and took their own idols with them, placing them around the Ka'bah to worship.Al-Azraq\u012b: Akhb\u0101r Makkah. Vol.1, Pg. 100. It is narrated that Ban\u016b Qays \u2018Ayl\u0101n bin MuDar coveted the Sacred House and they came one day in a great mass, accompanied by some other tribes, with the intention of seizing it. At that time the leader of Ban\u016b Qays \u2018Ayl\u0101n was \u2018Amr ibn al-Zarb al-'Udw\u0101n\u012b. Khuz\u0101\u2019ah went out to fight them, and a battled ensued, and finally the Ban\u016b Qays \u2018Ayl\u0101n fled.Al-Agh\u0101ni: Vol. 1, pg. 146. Similarly a group of the Haw\u0101zin also launched a raid on the Ban\u016b \u1e10\u0101\u1e6dir bin \u1e24abshah, one of the Ban\u016b Khuz\u0101'ah, just after the Haw\u0101zin had attacked the Ban\u016b Mal\u016b\u1e25 (who belonged to Kin\u0101nah); then the Ban\u016b \u1e10\u0101\u1e6dir and a group of Khuz\u0101'ah raided the Haw\u0101zin and killed many men.Al-Agh\u0101n\u012b. Vol. 14, pg. 145. On another occasion the Hawazin raided Khuza'ah, and the fought at al-MaHSab near Mina; they succeeded in beating the Banu 'Unqa' and some of the Banu DaTir from Khuza'ah.Al-Agh\u0101ni. Vol. 14, Pg. 148. ===Passing control of Mecca to Quraysh=== Quraysh, the descendants of al-Na\u1e11r bin Kin\u0101nah, were dispersed at that time both in Mecca and the surrounding area. This changed when Qu\u1e63ay bin Kil\u0101b got betrothed to Hubay bint \u1e24al\u012bl bin \u1e24abshah bin Sal\u016bl bin Ka\u2019b bin \u2018Amr al-Khuz\u0101\u2019\u012b; he married her and at that time her father was in charge of the Ka\u2019bah, so Qu\u1e63ay was later able to take over the custody of the Sanctuary. There are three different versions of the story of how Qu\u1e63ay managed to seize this custody: 1\\. Ibn Is\u1e25aq states that Qu\u1e63ay became wealthy, his sons were dispersed all over Mecca, and he was held in great respect. After the death of \u1e24al\u012bl, Qusay thought he had more right to govern Mecca than Khuz\u0101\u2019ah, since the tribe of Quraysh were the cream of the sons of Ism\u0101\u2019\u012bl son of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm and he was their pure descendant. The sons of Kin\u0101nah and Quraysh joined together to help him to expel Khuz\u0101\u2019ah and Ban\u016b Bakr from Mecca. He sent a message to is stepbrother, Raz\u0101\u1e25 bin Rab\u012b\u2019ah, asking him to assist, and he did indeed come. Raz\u0101\u1e25 rushed to Mecca with his tribe from Qu\u1e11\u0101\u2019ah, to help his brother in the war against Khuz\u0101\u2019ah. 2\\. Al-Azraq\u012b mentions that \u1e24alil liked Qu\u1e63ay, and gave him his daughter's hand during his lifetime. Qu\u1e63ay became the father of \u2018Abd al-D\u0101r, \u2018Abd Man\u0101f and \u2018Abd al-\u2018Uzz\u0101 among others. Now when \u1e24al\u012bl became old he used to give the key of the Ka\u2019bah to his daughter, and she would pass it to her husband to open up the Sacred House. When \u1e24al\u012bl was dying he considered the fact that Qu\u1e63ay had so many offspring and that they were well established, and he bequeathed him control of the Sanctuary, giving him the key. Now when Khuza\u2019ah found out about this they refused to give the control of the Sacred House to Qu\u1e63ay, and they took the key from Hubay. Now Qu\u1e63ay quickly went to his people the Quraysh and Banu Kin\u0101nah and sought their help against Khuz\u0101\u2019ah, and he also sent for his brother to come from the territory of Qu\u1e11a\u2019ah to assist. 3\\. Abu Hil\u0101l al-\u2018Asker\u012b relates that when \u1e24al\u012bl became old, he passed control of the Sacred House to Ab\u016b Ghabsh\u0101n Sal\u012bm bin \u2018Amr al-Khuz\u0101\u2019\u012b, and one day he and Qu\u1e63ay were drinking together; now when he became drunk Qu\u1e63ay bought the control of the Sacred House from him for a skinful of wine and a young camel. As a result there was a saying: \u201cMore damaging than the transaction of Ab\u016b Ghabsh\u0101n.\u201d These individual accounts when collated show that Qusay was getting ready to seize the Sacred House from Khuza\u2019ah, and Khuza\u2019ah set out to fight Qu\u1e63ay, Quraysh, Kin\u0101nah and his allies from Qu\u1e11aa\u2019ah. There was a fierce battle which was known as \u201cThe Day of Ab\u1e6da\u1e25\u201d (Yawm Ab\u1e6da\u1e25); there were many casualties on both sides but the army of Qu\u1e63ay was victorious. Finally both sides decided that they should seek a ruling about what to do; they consulted the leader of Banu Kin\u0101nah, Ya\u2019mar bin \u2018Awf bin Ka\u2019b bin \u2018\u0100mir bin Layth bin Bakr bin \u2018Abd Man\u0101t bin Kin\u0101nah, and he decide that Qu\u1e63ay should forget all the injuries sustained by him and his men, and that in recompense for the blood of Khuz\u0101\u2019ah spilled by Qu\u1e63ay\u2019s army blood money was due; but however Khuza\u2019ah should pass on the rule of Mecca to Qu\u1e63ay.Ibn \u1e24azm: Jamharat Ans\u0101b al- \u2018Arab, vol. 1, P. 35-38. This event occurred in the 5th century CE. The Khuz\u0101'ah remained allies of the Quraysh and in 570, the Year of the Elephant, took part in the battle against Abrahah. In 630, the Khuz\u0101'ah were attacked by the Ban\u016b Bakr, allies of the Quraysh. Since the Khuz\u0101'ah had recently formed an alliance with Mu\u1e25ammad ( referred to in the Qur'an,Chapter Al-Tawba (Repentance): 14. this attack constituted a breach of the Treaty of \u1e24udayb\u012byah of 628, that had brought about a truce between the Muslims and the Quraish and forbade hostilities between the two groups and their respective allies. This led to the conquest of Mecca by the Muslim armies, which occurred without a battle. The Ban\u016b Mustaliq was a branch of Ban\u016b Khuz\u0101'ah. They occupied the territory of Qudayd on the Red Sea shore between Jeddah and R\u0101bigh. ==Connection with the genealogy of Mu\u1e25ammad== The genealogy of Muhammad is connected to that of Khuz\u0101\u2019ah in two ways: firstly by way of his third great grandfather \u2018Abd Man\u0101f bin Qusay;Ibn \u1e24azm: Jamharat Ans\u0101b al-\u2018Arab. Vol.1, pg. 43. and also through his marriage to the \u2018Mother of the Believers\u2019 Juwayr\u012byah, daughter of al-\u1e24\u0101rith al-Khuz\u0101\u2019\u012b.Mu\u1e25ammad bin al- \u1e24asan Zab\u0101lah: Azw\u0101j al-Nab\u012b (\u1e62alall\u0101hu \u2018alaih\u012b wa sallam). Edited by Akram \u1e10iy\u0101\u2019 al-'Umr\u012b. 1st ed. Al-Mad\u012bnah 1401 AH. ==Role in the conquest of Mecca== At the time of the Truce of \u1e24udaybiyah one of the conditions set down was: \u201dWhoever wishes to enter into an agreement with Muhammad and into his covenant then he should enter it; and whoever wishes to enter into an agreement with the Quraysh and into their covenant then he should enter it.\u201dNaz\u0101r \u2018Abd al- La\u1e6d\u012bf: \u1e62ul\u1e25 al-Hudayb\u012byah in Mujallat al-Adab. Baghdad University, 1979, pg. 395. And Khuz\u0101\u2019ah leaped up with enthusiasm, saying: \u201cWe are in agreement with Mu\u1e25amamd and in his covenant!\u201d While the Ban\u016b al-Di\u2019l bin Bakr jumped up saying: \u201cWe are in agreement with the Quraysh and in their covenant!\u201dIbn Hish\u0101m: al-S\u012brat al-Nabaw\u012byah. Part 2, pg. 318. ===Quraysh break the truce=== Now while the truce was still holding the Ban\u016b al-Di\u2019l bin Bakr took advantage of it, and wanted to take blood revenge from Khuz\u0101\u2019ah for something that had happened in the Pre-Islamic period; they surprised them at a watering hole belonging to Khuz\u0101\u2019ah at al-Wat\u012br to the south of Mecca, and they killed twenty of their men. They were helped in this attack by Quraysh who supplied men and weapons; and Khuz\u0101'ah were driven into the Sacred Territory (\u1e24aram), where they were unable to continue fighting.Al-W\u0101qid\u012b:Al-Magh\u0101z\u012b. Vol. 2, Pg. 742. === Khuz\u0101\u2019ah seeks the aid of Mu\u1e25ammad === \u2018Amr bin S\u0101lim al-Khuz\u0101\u2019\u012b set out with forty mounted men of Khuz\u0101\u2019ah to go to Mu\u1e25ammad in order to tell him what had happened to them. And when Muhammad was among the people in the mosque, \u2018Amr recited a poem to him about the agreements and affiliations between them and Khuz\u0101'ah.Ibn Hish\u0101m: Al-Sirat al-Nabaw\u012byah. Part 2, pg. 394. ===Mu\u1e25ammad assists Khuz\u0101\u2019ah and conquers Mecca=== Then Mu\u1e25ammad said: \u201cYou have our help, O \u2018Amr ibn S\u0101lim!\u201d And he looked towards a cloud in the sky, saying: \u201cThis will make the victory of the Ban\u016b Ka\u2019b easy!\u201dIbn Hish\u0101m: Al- S\u012brat al-Nabaw\u012byah, part 2, pg. 395. Nawfil ibn Mu\u2019\u0101wiyah al-Di\u2019l\u012b al-Kin\u0101n\u012b apologized for his people saying: \u201cThe riders are lying to you.\u201d But Mu\u1e25ammad said: \u201cNever mind about the riders. We have nobody, whether close relatives or not close, in Tih\u0101mah who has been better with us than Khuz\u0101\u2019ah!\u201d Then he continued: \u201cI would not receive succor if I failed to assist Ban\u016b Ka\u2019b from the very thing in which I need help.\u201dAl-W\u0101qid\u012b: Al-Magh\u0101z\u012b. Vol. 2, pg.791. Mu\u1e25ammad gathered the army of the Muslims and they went to Mecca and conquered it. This was towards the end of January 630 CE (8 AH).Philip K. Hitti: History of the Arabs.
