    "text": "Schmitten is a climatic spa and municipality in the Hochtaunuskreis in Hessen, Germany. ==Geography== Schmitten is the highest community in the Taunus some 24 km north of Frankfurt am Main within whose limits is the Gro\u00dfer Feldberg (881 m). ===Neighbouring communities=== Schmitten borders in the north on the community of Weilrod and the town of Usingen, in the east on the towns of Neu- Anspach and Bad Homburg, in the south on the towns of Oberursel and K\u00f6nigstein, and in the west on the communities of Glash\u00fctten and Waldems (Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis). ===Constituent communities=== The greater community has nine centres (until municipal reform in 1972, all independent communities) named Arnoldshain, Brombach, Dorfweil, Hunoldstal, Niederreifenberg, Oberreifenberg, Schmitten, Seelenberg and Treisberg. ==History== Hattstein Castle's ruins in 2004 with ditch in the foreground and a piece of wall on the knoll through the trees Schmitten had its first documentary mention in 1399 as Waldschmidt. The name comes from a nail-making smithy in the woods (Wald is German for \"forest\"; Schmidt has the same root as Schmiede \u2013 smithy) which were attached to Hattstein Castle (mentioned in 1215). The Hattstein Knights (\"Hazechenstein\") were akin to the Reifenbergers (\"Riffinberg\"), possibly even the same. These families' origins were either in the Westerwald area north of the Lahn or the Limburg area. In the Walsdorfer Gr\u00fcndungsurkunde (\"Walsdorf Founding Document\") of 1156, a \"Guntramus de Hazechenstein\" is named. The Hattstein Knights, whose castle was destroyed several times, had property in Bad Camberg, Usingen (\"Hattsteiner Weiher\"), Stockheim, Weilbach, Aschaffenburg, Mainaschaff, K\u00f6nigstein and Frankfurt am Main. The Hattsteiners also participated in the founding of M\u00fcnzenberg Castle in the Wetterau. The noble family von Hattstein was throughout the Middle Ages one of Hesse's most influential families. Baron Marquard von Hattstein was Bishop of Speyer (1560\u20131581). Together with the Knights of Kronberg, the Hattsteiners and Reiffenbergers declared the so-called \"Kronberg Feud\" in 1389. When on 13 May a great force from Frankfurt swept to Kronberg Castle, Hanau and Electorate of the Palatinate troops rushed to help those being beset, driving the Frankfurt forces off on 14 May in the Battle of Eschborn and taking 620 prisoners, among them the mayor, a few noble council members and all the town's bakers, butchers, locksmiths and shoemakers. Only a ransom payment of 73,000 golden guilders ended the fight with Frankfurt and laid the groundwork for the Frankfurter Landwehr fortifications and Frankfurt's four watchtowers. The noble family of the Hattstein Knights, which was inseparably bound with Schmitten's history, came to an end with Johann Constantin Philipp von Hattstein's death in 1767. ===Arnoldshain=== Saint Lawrence's Church (Laurentiuskirche) at Arnoldshain was first mentioned early in the 13th century in the Rotulus omnium iurium (Directory of all rights). A few expansions to the once eight-sided chapel notwithstanding, the old part is preserved to this day. The Laurentiuskirche is thereby one of the oldest buildings still in use in the Hochtaunus. In a glass window from 1480 one can still clearly see the Reifenberg family's coat of arms. Politically Arnoldshain belonged to the Lords of Hattstein, but later partly under Reifenberg (Bassenheim) rule. ===Dorfweil=== Dorfweil had its first documentary mention in 772. Lying 410 m above sea level in the Weil Valley, the community has many hiking trails. With an area of 367 ha and 684 inhabitants (as of the end of 2004), Dorfweil is one of Schmitten's smallest constituent communities. ==Sightseeing== ===Gro\u00dfer Feldberg=== The Taunus's highest mountain attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors every year, especially from the Frankfurt Rhein-Main Region. In Oberreifenberg lifts for skiing and sledding enjoyment are to be found. The main attraction, though, is of course the Taunus's nature and many kilometres of well groomed hiking trails. ===Treisberg=== Observation tower The lookout tower on the 663-m-high Pferdskopf (\"Horse's Head\") near Treisberg affords a fantastic view of the Taunus landscape and is the object of many outings. In the winter, skiers and tobogganers are drawn to the Taunus's most attractive skilifts. ===Weiltal=== Rising on the Feldberg, the little brook Weil snakes its way through the Hochtaunus Nature Park through to Weilburg. Alongside the Weil runs the Weiltalwanderweg (Weil Valley Hiking Trail). A Weil Valley visit is popular among families and nature lovers, but also for cyclists and motorcyclists. Besides the yearly Weiltal-Marathon, the traditional \"Rund um den Henninger- Turm\" bicycle race also runs through the Weil Valley. ===Limes=== The Roman Empire's old border runs above Niederreifenberg and Oberreifenberg across the crest of the Taunus. Within Schmitten's municipal limits lies the Limeskastell Kleiner Feldberg, a Roman fort. The preserved foundation walls offer a glimpse into Roman history. ===Reifenberg Castle ruins=== The castle's keep and tower are preserved and loom over Oberreifenberg and the Weil Valley. ==Politics== ===Municipal council=== The municipal elections on 26 March 2006 yielded the following results: * CDU 10 seats (2001: 9 seats) * SPD 3 seats (2001: 5 seats) * Greens 3 seats (2001: 3 seats) * FDP 4 seats (2001: 4 seats) * UBB 4 seats (2001: 5 seats) * FWG 7 seats (2001: 5 seats) Note: FWG is a citizens' coalition. ==Partnerships== Schmitten maintains partnerships with the following places, all in France: {| | |Courtomer (1981) |- | |Moulins-la- Marche (1981) |- | |Sainte-Gauburge (1981) |} ==Public institutions== ===Educational institutions=== The community of Schmitten has two primary schools at its disposal. * J\u00fcrgen-Schuhmann-Schule in Arnoldshain * Grundschule Reifenberg in Niederreifenberg Furthermore, there exists in Arnoldshain an Evangelical Academy called the \"Martin Niem\u00f6ller\" Haus. ===Sports and leisure=== * Schmitten (main town) offers Hesse's highest outdoor swimming pool. * In Niederreifenberg quad bikes may be hired. * In Oberreifenberg the Taunatours company offers rock climbing. ==Personalities== ===Sons and daughters of the town=== * In Seelenberg were born in 1868 the oil-drilling pioneer Anton Raky and in 1841 the theologian Anton Abt. * At the edge of the Hunoldstal (valley) lived the well known German singer Ivan Rebroff. * The writer Gerhard Zwerenz lived in Arnoldshain. ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Unofficial Seelenberg website * Category:Hochtaunuskreis ",
