The factory was manufacturing bicycles branded Tripol until 1934, when the company was split into two, and the manufacture of Tripol was moved to a newly build factory. The old factory remained to Hering, who founded his own brand, Tudor. In 1948, both factories have been nationalised and made part of the state- owned \u010cZ Strakonice. Following a reorganisation in 1950, factories were made part of the newly created state-owned company Eska Cheb. Since two previously factories were making bicycles of two distinct brands, in 1951 the head of the company Josef Bochn\u00ed\u010dek, suggested a new brand for the united company, Favorit. == References == Category:Cycle manufacturers of Czechoslovakia ",
