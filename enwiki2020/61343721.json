At the J Awards of 2016, the album was nominated for Australian Album of the Year. ==Reception== Dylan Marshall from The AU Review called Glorious Heights \"a momentous beginning\" and \"one of the albums that you can sit down, listen to and genuinely just really enjoy the moment; whether for its music, vocals, lyrics, themes, or a sweet combination of them all.\" Isadora Vadasz from The Music Insight stated that \"Over 13 tracks, Montaigne takes her listeners on an epic journey of wild highs and sullen lows... The resulting sound beckons you into a dark circus tent full of temptations and pleasant surprises.\" Jeff Jenkins from Stack Magazine said \"[Montaigne]'s debut album is aptly titled, with the singer delivering thrilling electro pop infused with genuine soul. She's just as effective when she straightens up and simplifies things \u2013 check out the ballad 'Consolation Prize' and the pure pop of 'What You Mean to Me'. A star is born.\" Banda Wilson from Music Feeds wrote: \"Glorious Heights is a record that is built around Montaigne's inimitable voice. Pretty much everything else created with the goal of featuring her vocals in a variety of contexts, in an effort to show off her vocal skillset.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Montaigne \u2013 vocals *Tony Buchen \u2013 production, recording, mixing *Next Episode \u2013 design *Wes Talbott \u2013 art *Leon Zervos \u2013 mastering ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !
