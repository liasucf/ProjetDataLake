    "text": "Smoky whiskey is whiskey that is flavored by burning peat moss to infuse the grain, while also drying the malted barley to stop full germination from taking place. The peat smoke contains phenolic compounds, whose presence in the barley is measured in phenol parts per million, which is not an entirely reliable measurement of how much peat actually ends up in the whisky, since smoky phenols can be lost in various stages of whiskymaking and maturation. The most common kind of smoky whiskey is single malt scotch, especially those whiskies originating in Islay. ==References== Category:Whisky ",
