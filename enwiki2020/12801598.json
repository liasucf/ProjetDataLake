Of those, seven players would eventually play in the Major Leagues. The Dodgers first round pick in the June draft was outfielder Michael White from Loudon High School in Loudon, Tennessee. In seven seasons of professional baseball (six of them in the Dodgers system), he hit .277 with 12 homers and 217 RBI. After his career he went on to get 2 master's degrees and start his own IT consulting company. The most notable pick in the draft was infielder Dave Hansen, selected in the 2nd round out of Rowland High School in California. Hansen is also a distant cousin of Dodger Mike White. Hansen played in the Majors from 1990\u20132007, and was one of the more accomplished pinch hitters in league history. He hit .260 with 35 homers and 222 RBI. After his playing career he became a Major League hitting coach. {| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; background:inherit\" |- ! 1986 Draft Picks |- | ===January draft=== 1986 Los Angeles Dodgers Picks in the MLB January Draft-Regular Phase {| class=\"wikitable\" !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Round !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Name !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Position !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|School !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Signed !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Career span !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Highest level |- |1 |Timothy Anderson |IF | Sacramento City College |Yes | 1986\u20131987 |A |- |2 |Brian Flanagan |OF | Citrus College |No | | |- |3 |Lee Langley |OF | Linn\u2013Benton Community College |Yes | 1986\u20131997 | A+ |- |4 |Adam Brown |C | Georgia Perimeter College |Yes | 1986\u20131995 | AAA |- |5 |Stephen Carmarda |RHP | San Jacinto College |No | | |- |6 |Darren Lewis |OF | Chabot College |No Athletics-1988 | 1988\u20132002 | MLB |- |7 |Mike Bundesen |LHP | Mott Community College |No | | |- |8 |Keith Hayes |C | University of Nebraska at Lincoln |No | | |- |9 |Brad Freking |LHP | William Rainey Harper College |No | | |- |10 |Ranfred Johnson |RHP | Los Angeles Harbor College |No Mariners-1987 | 1987\u20131989 | A |- |11 |Mike Bledsoe |LHP | College of the Sequoias |No | | |- |12 |Elliott Quinones |OF | Gulf Coast Community College |No Reds-1989 | 1989\u20131992 | A |- |13 |Mike Ripplinger |OF | Taft College |No | | |- |14 |Tim Anderson |OF | Georgia Perimeter College |No | | |- |15 |David Downey |OF | Muscatine Community College |No | | |- |16 |David Ray |C | Georgia Perimeter College |No | | |} ====January Secondary phase==== 1986 Los Angeles Dodgers Picks in the MLB January Draft-Secondary Phase {| class=\"wikitable\" !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Round !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Name !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Position !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|School !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Signed !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Career span !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Highest level |- |1 |James Kating |C | Triton College |Yes | 1986\u20131990 |AA |- |2 |Blake Butterfield |RHP | Mt.
