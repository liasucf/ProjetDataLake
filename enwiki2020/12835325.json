    "text": "Tyrone House in County Galway is a ruined manor house, built in the 1770s on a promontory by the estuary of the Kilcolgan river, about from the village of Kilcolgan, County Galway, Ireland. The house was destroyed by the local Irish Republican Army (IRA) unit during the Irish War of Independence. ==History== Tyrone House, County Galway, was built in 1779. (It should not be confused with Tyrone House, Marlborough Street, Dublin, a townhouse designed by Richard Cassels for The 1st Earl of Tyrone of the 3rd creation in 1740.) Its original owner was Christopher St. George, scion of an old Norman Galwegian family. The house was reputedly designed by John Roberts (1712\u20131796) of Waterford, who also designed Moore Hall in County Mayo and Waterford Cathedral. The St. George family at the time owned much of the area around Kilcolgan. Arthur French St. George was described as a resident proprietor in 1824. In 1912, Tyrone House was described as \"rather dilipated\" by visitor Violet Martin. It served as an inspiration for the novel \"The Big House at Inver\" by Edith Somerville, published in 1925. The house was destroyed by the local IRA unit during the Irish War of Independence in 1920 due to rumours that it was going to be used by the Black and Tans as an infirmary. The house was uninhabited at the time, except for a bed-bound caretaker who was taken from the house in his bed and left in another building on the premises before the main house was set alight. ==References== ==External links== * National University of Galway Estate Records * National Inventory of Architectural Heritage Category:Ruins in the Republic of Ireland Category:Buildings and structures in County Galway Category:Beresford family Category:1779 establishments in Ireland Category:1920 disestablishments in Ireland ",
