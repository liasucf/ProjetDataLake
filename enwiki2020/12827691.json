    "text": "Grateful dead (or grateful ghost) is a folktale present in many cultures throughout the world. ==Overview== The most common story involves a traveler who encounters a corpse of someone who never received a proper burial, typically stemming from an unpaid debt. The traveler then either pays off the dead person's debt or pays for burial. The traveler is later rewarded or has their life saved by a person or animal who is actually the soul of the dead person; the grateful dead is a form of the donor. The grateful dead spirit may take many different physical forms including that of a guardian angel, animal, or fellow traveler. The traveler's encounter with the deceased comes near the end of the traveler's journey. ==Classification== The \"grateful dead\" story is Aarne\u2013Thompson\u2013Uther type 505. Folkloristic scholarship classify ATU types 505-508 under the umbrella term The Grateful Dead, each subtype referring to a certain aspect of the legend:Bohler, Danielle. \"B\u00e9ances de la terre et du temps: la dette et le pacte dans le motif du Mort reconnaissant au Moyen Age\".

In French academia, the archetype of the Gratetul Dead is known as Jean de Calais. ==Variants== In many cultures there is the belief that when a person dies their soul is separated from their body thus giving someone a proper burial allows their spirit to carry on into the next life. An ancient Egyptian text explains the principle of reciprocity in which the deceased calls for a blessing on the person who remembers his name and helps him into a happy afterlife: > But if there be a man, any one whomsoever, who beholdeth this writing and > causeth my soul and my name to become established among those who are > blessed, let it be done for him likewise after his final arriving (at the > end of life's voyage) in recompense for what was done by him for me, > Osiris.\"The Burden of Isis, Being the Laments of Isis and Nephthys\", James > Teackle Dennis, Dutton & Co, 1910 One variant of the motif is the Book of Tobit.Laura A.

Due to his chivalry the deceased is resurrected and aids the hero in recovering the riches that was used to provide him with a proper burial. ===In folk and fairy tales=== The Grateful Dead motif also appears in various fairy tales,\"The Grateful Dead, or Bertuccio and Tarquinia: LEONORA.\" In The Pleasant Nights - Volume 2, edited by Beecher Donald, by Straparola Giovan Francesco and Waters W.G., 446-74.
