There he was a pupil of \u00c9mile Durand for harmony, C\u00e9sar Franck for organ and Victor Mass\u00e9 for musical composition. After an honorary mention in 1877 he won the First Grand Prix de Rome with the three-part scene La fille de Jepht\u00e9 based on a text by \u00c9douard Guinant. During his stay at the Villa Medici in Rome, which was associated with the prize, Broutin composed Sinai, a work for orchestra, choir and soloists, which was premiered in 1881 in the hall of the Conservatoire de Paris. The work was received coolly by the audience, but critics praised it for the excellent quality of the composition, its exquisite taste and great intelligence. In the following years he composed a number of songs and piano pieces, several orchestral pieces and an opera. Most of his works were published by \"Lemoine\". In his native town, a street was named after him. == Works == *Rebecca \u00e0 la fontaine, three-part scene, 1877 *La fille de Jephth\u00e9, three-part scene, 1878 *Sinai for choir, orchestra and soloists, 1881 *Mazurka lente for piano, 1883 *2 Pi\u00e8ces for violin and piano, 1886 *Suite pour orchestre *Ouverture triomphale for Orchestra *Danse isra\u00e9lite for Orchestra *Fantaisie militaire for Harmony Orchestra *10 Pi\u00e8ces famili\u00e8res for piano *Jenny, one-act Op\u00e9ra comique after Edmond Guiraud, 1889 == External links == * Cl\u00e9ment Broutin on Musimem Category:1851 births Category:1889 deaths Category:People from Nord (French department) Category:French Romantic composers Category:French opera composers Category:19th-century French composers Category:Prix de Rome for composition Category:French male composers Category:19th-century male musicians ",
