In addition Dumbarton competed in the Dumbartonshire Cup. ==Scottish League== In their ninth consecutive season in the Second Division, things were looking bright for Dumbarton's league challenge, as at the turn of the year they were lying only a point behind a promotion place. However a run of 5 straight defeats in January 1931 snuffed out these hopes and in the end Dumbarton finished a midtable 10th out of 20, with 38 points - 23 behind champions Third Lanark. ==Scottish Cup== Dumbarton were knocked out in the first round by Aberdeen. ==Dumbartonshire Cup== Dumbarton retained the Dumbartonshire Cup, again beating Clydebank in the final, with Willie Parlane scoring all five goals. ==Friendlies== Elsewhere 3 friendly matches were played, including a match against a Rangers XI and two trial matches for the Dumbartonshire Juniors. Of these matches, there was 1 win and 2 losses, scoring 4 goals for the loss of 4. ==Player statistics== |} Source: ===International Caps=== Stewart Lennie and Willie Parlane earned their first amateur caps playing for Scotland against Wales and England respectively in the Amateur Home Internationals. ===Transfers=== ==== Players in ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;width:98%; text- align:left\" |- !Player !From !Date |- | William Gilmour | Clydebank | 12 Aug 1930 |- | Thomas Cameron | Croy Celtic | 28 Aug 1930 |- | Alistair McLachlan | Amateur | 2 Sep 1930 |- | Alex Parlane | Amateur | 2 Sep 1930 |- | Andrew Young | Clyde | 20 Feb 1931 |- | James McNish | Maryhill Hibs | 26 Feb 1931 |- | Thomas Pye | Dunblane Rovers | 16 Apr 1931 |- | William Barrie | Arthurlie | |} ==== Players out ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font- size:95%;width:98%; text-align:left\" |- !Player !To !Date |- | James Miller | Swansea City | 13 Jun 1930 |- | James Brannan | Bo'ness | 21 Jun 1930 |- | James Warden | Third Lanark | 7 Aug 1930 |- | Archibald McNish | Freed | 30 Oct 1930 |- | James Stewart | Freed | 5 Dec 1930 |- | Alex Fraser | Bo'ness | 19 Dec 1930 |- | Benjamin Swanson | Freed | 25 Jan 1931 |- | Thomas Cameron | Freed | 5 Feb 1931 |- | Robert Speedie | King's Park | |} In addition William Hyslop, William Kirk, William Livingston and Archibald McLardie all played their last games in Dumbarton 'colours'.
