The lyrics of the album lean heavily on messages of hope, love, and inspiration. The album was released to positive reviews; Andy Garrigue commented that \"Both sultry and righteous, sassy and pouting, Carawan's got a hair raising set of pipes. She sets a mood impossible to ignore.\"CD Baby: \"\" ==Track listing== # \"The Journey\" - 4:13 # \"The People Who Love You\" - 4:09 # \"Love Came Home\" - 4:56 # \"Everything I Need\" - 5:00 # \"Guardian Angel\" - 4:16 # \"Leap of Faith\" - 3:54 # \"I Wish You Well\" - 4:49 # \"It's Gonna Come Back To You\" - 3:31 # \"Count Your Blessings (Instead of Sheep)\" (Irving Berlin) - 4:25 # \"Brighter Day\" - 6:14 # \"What a Wonderful World\" (Bob Thiele / George David Weiss) - 2:42 ==References== ==External links== *Lyrics for Out of the Blue Category:2003 albums ",
