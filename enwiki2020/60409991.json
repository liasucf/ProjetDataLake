She later departed for South Korea in 2014 to become a K-pop idol by becoming a trainee under JYP Entertainment.

In February 2020 it was reported that Mina's condition had improved and that she had returned to performing live with Twice. == Discography == ===Songwriting credits=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Year !Song !Album !Artist !With !Ref. |- |2018 |\"Shot Thru The Heart\" |Summer Nights |rowspan=\"2\"|Twice |Momo and Sana | |- |2019 |\"21:29\" |Feel Special |All Twice members | |} == References == ==External links== Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century Japanese women singers Category:21st-century Japanese singers Category:Japanese dance musicians Category:Japanese expatriates in South Korea Category:Japanese female singers Category:Japanese K-pop singers Category:Japanese-language singers Category:JYP Entertainment artists Category:Korean-language singers of Japan Category:K-pop singers Category:Musicians from Kobe Category:Musicians from San Antonio Category:People who lost United States citizenship Category:Reality show winners Category:Twice (group) members ",
