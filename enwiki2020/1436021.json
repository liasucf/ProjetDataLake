    "text": "Helpful Henry was the name of two comic strips -- one from the United States, the other from the United Kingdom. == American comic strip Helpful Henry (1922\u20131927) == Helpful Henry was an American gag-a-day comic strip, created by cartoonist J. P. Arnot (Paul Arnot \u2013 Born: 16 September 1887 \u2013 Died: 2 December 1951). https://www.lambiek.net/artists/a/arnot_jp.htm The series ran from July 17, 1922 until 1927 and was syndicated by International Feature Service. Despite its brief run actor Oliver Hardy, of Laurel and Hardy fame, said the character was an inspiration for his own screen character.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/a/arnot_jp.htm He described Helpful Henry as being big, fussy and self-important, but underneath it all, he was a very nice fellow. ==British comic strip Helpful Henry (1938\u20131939) == Helpful Henry was also a British gag-a-day comic strip from the magazine The Beano. It first appeared in Beano issue 1, dated 30 July 1938, drawn by Eric Roberts. A similarly named character had also appeared in the first issue of The Wizard under the name 'Elpful 'Enery. The central character is Henry, a young boy who attempts to be helpful but ends up doing more harm than good \u2013 usually as a result of a misunderstanding or misinterpretation. He was also in The Dandy Annual 1939, which came out two months after Beano No. 1 \u2013 it is unknown whether the character moved comic or if this was a preview. However some characters, such as Marmaduke Mean the Miser, only appeared in the annuals, so that could be the explanation. As well as this some early Dandy characters such as Podge appeared in the 1940 Beano annual so this could be the case of minor characters just appearing in any DC Thomson annual. Helpful Henry reappeared in Sparky in issue 211 (dated 1 February 1969) drawn by Hugh Morren this strip lasted in Sparky until issue 230.The Sparky File http://crikey.forumotion.com/t148-the-sparky-file ==References== Category:American comic strips Category:American comics characters Category:1925 comics debuts Category:Comics characters introduced in 1925 Category:1926 comics endings Category:Gag-a-day comics Category:Beano strips Category:British comic strips Category:British comics characters Category:1938 comics debuts Category:Comics characters introduced in 1938 Category:1939 comics endings Category:Child characters in comics ",
