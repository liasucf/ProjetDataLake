    "text": "The Jimmy Carter National Historic Site, located in Plains, Georgia, preserves sites associated with James Earl \"Jimmy\" Carter, Jr. (born 1924), 39th President of the United States. These include his residence, boyhood farm, school, and the town railroad depot, which served as his campaign headquarters during the 1976 election. The building which used to be Plains High School (opened in 1921 and closed in 1979) serves as the park's museum and visitor center. As President Carter lives in Plains, the area surrounding the residence is under the protection of the United States Secret Service and is not open to the public. The Carters returned to Plains in 1981. The former President and First Lady Rosalynn Carter pursue many of the goals of his administration through the Carter Center in Atlanta, which has programs to alleviate human suffering and to promote human rights and world peace. When they are in Plains, Carter teaches Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church, which is open to the public. ==Visitor center and museum== The former Plains High School, which both Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter attended, now serves as the park's visitor center and museum. It features a classroom, principal's office, and auditorium which have been restored to look as they would have when Jimmy Carter attended. An exact replica of the Resolute desk, which Jimmy Carter brought back to the Oval Office to use as his presidential desk, is exhibited, as is his 2002 Nobel Peace Prize. Other rooms feature exhibits that explain the lives of Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter, and a short video focuses on the life of Jimmy Carter according to his friends, neighbors, and family. ==Boyhood home== The farm in rural Archery where Jimmy lived from age four in 1928 until he left for college in 1941 has been restored to its appearance before electricity was installed in 1938. ==Campaign headquarters== The former Plains Train Depot, where Carter headquartered his presidential campaign, now serves as a museum focusing on the 1976 Presidential Campaign and Election. It features exhibits which highlight Jimmy Carter's campaign for President. The train depot operated from 1888 until 1951, when all public transportation to and from the area ceased. ==Carter compound== The current home of the Carters, while currently not open to the public, is technically a part of the National Historic Site. The Carters have lived in the home since 1961. During his presidency, it was used as his Summer White House. ==Photos== ===Plains Train Depot=== Image:CarterHQ.jpg|Plains train depot, which served as the 1976 Carter campaign headquarters Image:Jimmy Carter campaign headquarters, inside, Plains, GA, US.jpg|Inside the campaign headquarters ===Visitor Center and Museum=== Image:Jimmy Carter's High School, Plains, GA, US.jpg|Carter's High School, now a museum and visitor's center Image:16 02 001 carter.jpg|Detail of classroom Image:16 02 021 carter.jpg|Detail of classroom Image:16 02 036 carter.jpg|The principal's office Image:17 02 018 carter.jpg|Auditorium ===Carter Boyhood Farm=== Image:17 02 0166 carter.jpg|Map of farm Image:Windmill water pump on Jimmy Carter homesite, Plains, GA, US.jpg|A water pump powered by a windmill Image:16 02 167 carter.jpg|Barn and old farm equipment Image:17 25 003 carter.jpg|Blacksmith shop Image:17 02 181 carter.jpg|Earl and Lillian Carter home Image:16 02 046 carter.jpg|Detail of front porch Image:16 02 051 carter.jpg|Detail of dining room Image:17 02 060 carter.jpg|Detail of bedroom Image:16 02 056 carter.jpg|Detail of bedroom Image:17 02 111 carter.jpg|Carter family country store Image:16 02 094 carter.jpg|Detail of country store Image:17 02 129 carter.jpg|Rachel and Jack Clark's tenant house Image:16 02 155 carter.jpg|Tenant house, main room Image:17 25 027 carter.jpg|Tenant house, kitchen ==Sources== ==External links== *Official Park Service site *\"Life Portrait of Jimmy Carter\", from C-SPAN's American Presidents: Life Portraits, broadcast from the Jimmy Carter National Historic Site, December 3, 1999 *Jimmy Carter's Boyhood Home * Category:National Historic Sites in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Protected areas of Sumter County, Georgia Category:Presidential homes in the United States National Historic Site Category:Historic house museums in Georgia (U.S. state) Jimmy Carter National Historic Site Category:Presidential museums in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Protected areas established in 1987 Category:1987 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Houses in Sumter County, Georgia Category:National Register of Historic Places in Sumter County, Georgia ",
