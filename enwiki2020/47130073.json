    "text": "The Vara\u017edin literary circle or Croatian-Kajkavian literary circle () was a literary group which emerged at the end of the 16th century in Vara\u017edin. The framework of the Vara\u017edin literary circle had four members. One of them was Roman Catholic vicar Antun Vramec, while the other members were writers Ivanu\u0161 Pergo\u0161i\u0107, Bla\u017e \u0160krinjari\u0107 and Bla\u017e Antilovi\u0107. The arrival of Antun Vramec to Vara\u017edin marked the emergence of the Vara\u017edin literary circle. Some members of this literary circle were the first authors to write or publish texts in the Kajkavian dialect of Croatian language. The forerunner of this literary circle was Protestant preacher Mihajlo Bu\u010di\u0107. Some sources include Bu\u010di\u0107 as a member of this literary circle. The Vara\u017edin literary circle followed the line of contemporary European literary and theological societies. The Vara\u017edin literary circle was careful not to show any sympathies toward Protestant Reformation. In his works, Vramec deliberately used simple language spoken by the population of Slavonia to suppress the books published by Protestants. == References == == Sources == * * * * * * * * == Further reading == * Ivan Zvonar: Vara\u017edinski knji\u017eevni krug u drugoj polovini \u0161esnaestog stolje\u0107a : u povodu objavljivanja pretiska Decretuma Ivanu\u0161a Pergo\u0161i\u0107a u redakciji dr.
