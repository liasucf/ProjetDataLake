    "text": "The Treznea massacre occurred in the village of Treznea (\u00d6rd\u00f6gk\u00fat) in north- western Transylvania on 9 September 1940, during the handing over of Northern Transylvania from Romania to Hungary after the Second Vienna Award. ==The events== Hungarian troops marching in nearby Zal\u0103u (Zilah), the day before On that day, instigated by the former landlord Francisc (or Ferenc) Bay, the 22nd Hungarian Border Guards Battalion \"Debrecen\", led by Lieutenant-Colonel \u00c1kosy, made a 4 km detour from the Zal\u0103u-Cium\u0103rna-Hida (Zilah-Cs\u00f6m\u00f6rl\u0151-Hidalm\u00e1s) route to exterminate the locals from the \"M\u0103gura\" area of the commune, which formerly belonged to Francisc Bay. The Hungarian troops entered the village at noon, the first victims being the children who pastured the animals. The troops fired at will on the locals, killing many of them and partially destroying the Orthodox church. The sources recorded that 87 Romanians and 6 Jews were killed, including the local Orthodox priest, Traian Costea, who was burned alive in his church, and the Romanian local teacher with his wife, Laz\u0103r and Aurelia Cosma (the parents of the Romanian musicologist ). Some Hungarian historians claim that the killings came in retaliation after the Hungarian troops were fired upon by inhabitants, allegedly incited by the local Romanian Orthodox priest. These claims are not supported by the accounts of several witnesses. The motivation of the 4 km detour of the Hungarian troops from the rest of the Hungarian Army is still a point of contention, as it could not have been as a routine occupation maneuver. Most evidence points towards the local noble Ferenc Bay who lost a large part of his estates to peasants in the 1920s, as most of the violence was directed towards the peasants living on his former estate. By the accounts of some witnesses, not all soldiers were wearing full uniform and some of them were drunk. Also, some villagers claim to have recognised some of the young men as locals from Zal\u0103u (Zilah). This might suggest that not everyone in these Hungarian troops were operating under the jurisdiction of the Hungarian Army. According to some historians, several Hungarian inhabitants of the village tried to stop the massacre, but they were themselves chased and beaten. Other source mentioned that a local Hungarian woman (out of the 10\u201315 Hungarian families living in the village) encouraged the killings by shouting to the troops: \"Kill all the Romanians so that only us Hungarians will remain in the village\". Other source (Doctor Ioan Pu\u0219ca\u0219) recalled that his knowledge of Hungarian and two Hungarian women from the village saved him from certain death. About 200 locals were rounded up and pushed towards a cliff, where they were to be machine-gunned. However, they were let go after the retreating Romanian Army, stationed nearby at Poarta S\u0103lajului (Vaskapu), threatened to intervene. ==Aftermath== After the war, the Cluj People's Tribunal sentenced in this case and other war crimes 481 people, out of which 100 to death and 163 to life imprisonment. However, most of them were tried in absentia and never served their sentences. == See also == * List of massacres in Romania * Ip massacre * Nu\u0219fal\u0103u massacre * S\u0103rma\u0219u massacre == Notes == == References == * * * * * Category:Massacres in the 1940s Category:World War II massacres Category:20th century in Transylvania Category:Romania in World War II Category:Massacres in Romania Category:Massacres in Hungary Category:Military history of Hungary Category:1940 in Romania Category:Mass murder in 1940 Category:Anti-Romanian sentiment Category:September 1940 events Category:1940s murders in Hungary Category:1940 murders in Europe ",
