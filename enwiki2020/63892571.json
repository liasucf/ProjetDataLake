    "text": "The Re\u015fadiye Mar\u015f\u0131 () is an imperial anthem of the Ottoman Empire from 1909 to 1918. Upon the commencement of Sultan Mehmed V Resad\u2019s reign in 1909, a competition was declared to find a personal march for the new sultan. The contest was won by Italo Selvelli, who was of Italian heritage (as were nearly all the other creators of personal marches for previous sultans). Also, like the previous sultan\u2019s march, this anthem also appears to have lyrics as well. == Lyrics == NOT AVAILABLE == References == == External links == Category:Anthems ",
