The cover athlete is Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive tackle John Randle. ==Reception== The game received \"mixed\" reviews, albeit a bit more well-received than the first NFL Xtreme, according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. John Lee of Next Generation said, \"Football purists will not be amused. Blitz fans will not be amused. In fact, unless you're looking for a simple diversion and [you] don't mind an erratic playbook, neither will you.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:1999 video games Category:National Football League video games Category:North America-exclusive video games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:PlayStation (console)-only games Category:Video games developed in the United States ",
