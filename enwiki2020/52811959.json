His artistic talent manifested itself early and, at the age of fifteen, he was enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, where he studied with the landscape painter, Julius Ma\u0159\u00e1k. Originally, his works were influenced by the Realistic style of artists such as Anton\u00edn Chittussi and Camille Corot. Timeline, criticism and exhibition notes @ the National Gallery, Prague. In 1898, he was awarded a scholarship that enabled him to study in Paris, where he was exposed to the Barbizon school and the Impressionists. Upon returning, he came under the influence of his slightly older colleague, Anton\u00edn Slav\u00ed\u010dek, who was also a former student of Ma\u0159\u00e1k's. In the final phase of his career, he turned from pure landscapes and began concentrating on figures. His large canvas, \"Killed by Lightning\" (which was never completed) contains some elements of what would become known as Expressionism. For reasons that were never made clear, he committed suicide by shooting himself in the woods outside Mal\u00e1 Chuchle. His economic situation was secure and nothing in his correspondence suggested family problems. Eight months before his death, he made an extended visit to the spa at \u017dichovice, but the specific reason for it is unknown. Recent speculation centers on a depressive disorder that went undiagnosed due to his introverted personality.\"Mal\u00ed\u0159 Otakar Lebeda: tragick\u00fd osud \u010desk\u00e9ho Vincenta van Gogha\" by Dr.Peter Kov\u00e1\u010d @ Stavitel\u00e9 Katedr\u00e1l. == Selected paintings == File:Otokar Lebada - Z Krkono\u0161 - Cesta.jpg|Path in the Krkono\u0161e File:Otakar Lebeda - Z bechynsk\u00e9 obory - Srnky.jpg|Deer at the Bechy\u0148sk\u00fd Game Reserve File:Otakar Lebeda Maskenball.jpg|Masked Ball File:Otakar Lebeda - Zabit\u00fd bleskem.jpg|Killed by Lightning == References == == External links == *Exhibition at the National Gallery (2010) @ PragueOUT *Otakar Lebeda @ abART Category:1877 births Category:1901 deaths Category:19th-century Czech painters Category:19th-century male artists Category:Landscape painters Category:Artists from Prague Category:Artists who committed suicide Category:Czech male painters ",
