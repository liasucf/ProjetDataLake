The station is on the Edgware branch of the Northern line, between Hendon Central and Golders Green stations, and in Travelcard Zone 3. The Brent Cross shopping centre is some distance away. However, the bus route 210 stops outside the station on Highfield Avenue and the bus route 232 stops near the exit of station on Heathfield Gardens. ==History== The station was designed by architect Stanley Heaps and opened as Brent, the name of the nearby river, on 19 November 1923.London Transport Museum The station just before opening. Note the space for (later) by-pass tracksLondon Transport Museum Station building at opening It was the first station of the extension of what was then known as the Hampstead & Highgate Line, which was built through undeveloped rural areas to Edgware. The extension had first been planned prior to World War I when the station had been due to be called Woodstock. It was renamed from Brent to its current name on the 20 July 1976 opening of the shopping centre. Two passing loops were built at the station, not long after it opened, to allow fast trains to overtake slower ones here, but these extra tracks were removed in the 1930s. The bridges over Highfield Avenue reflect this extra width, although both north and south of the station the alignment narrows again. == Development == A planning application, registered in March 2008, for the nearby Brent Cross areaDevelopers' website London Borough of Barnet Regeneration proposals would improve bus services passing the station. A turning circle for buses outside the tube station is proposed, needing the demolition of nearby housing.
