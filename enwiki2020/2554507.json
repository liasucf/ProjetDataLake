    "text": "Scalding is a form of thermal burn resulting from heated fluids such as boiling water or steam. Most scalds are considered first or second degree burns, but third degree burns can result, especially with prolonged contact. The term is from the Latin word calidus, meaning hot.Mosby's Medical, Nursing & Allied Health Dictionary, Fourth Edition, Mosby-Year Book Inc., 1994, p. 1395. ==Causes== Most scalds result from exposure to high-temperature water, such as tap water in baths and showers or cooking water, or from spilled hot drinks, such as coffee. Scalds can be more severe when steam impinges on the naked skin, because steam can reach higher temperatures than water and transfers latent heat by condensation. On the other hand when clothes are soaked with hot water the heat transfer is often of a longer duration since the body part cannot be removed from the heat source as quickly. The temperature of tap water should not exceed 38\u201345 \u00b0C to prevent discomfort and scalding.German and European norm DIN EN 806-2 asks for a maximum of 45 \u00b0C in public buildings. The temperature in care homes and childcare is not to exceed 43 \u00b0C with a maximum of 38 \u00b0C in showers. The German guideline VDI 3818 generally recommends 40 \u00b0C for public bathrooms and toilets. However, it is necessary to keep warm water at a temperature of 55\u201360 \u00b0C to inhibit the growth of legionella bacteria. Water at 60 \u00b0C can induce scalding injuries in less than 3 seconds, while it takes 10 seconds to get an injury at 57 \u00b0C and 1.5 to 2 minutes in 52 \u00b0C hot water.FAQ Thermostatic mixing valves \u2013 Why is it important to have a thermostatic mixing valve?, ESBE AB, Sweden Scalds are generally more common in children, especially from the accidental spilling of hot liquids. == Treatment == Applying first aid for scalds is the same as for burns. First, the site of the injury should be removed from the source of heat, to prevent further scalding. If the burn is at least second degree, remove any jewelry or clothing from the site, unless it is already stuck to the skin. Cool the scald for about 20 minutes with cool or lukewarm (not cold) water, such as water from a tap.Burns and scalds - NHS Choices, Treating Burns and Scalds. With second-degree burns, blisters will form, but should never be popped, as it only increases chances of infection. With third-degree burns, it is best to wrap the injury very loosely to keep it clean, and seek expert medical attention. ===Treatments to avoid=== Ice should be avoided, as it can do further damage to area around the injury,The Dos and Don'ts of Burns, What's the best way to treat a burn? as should butter, toothpaste, and specialized creams. ==Food production == === Beef, poultry and pork === Blister from a second-degree burn, 2 days after the injury. The carcasses of beef, poultry and pork are commonly scalded after slaughter to facilitate the removal of feathers and hair. Methods including immersion in tanks of hot water or spraying with steam. The scalding may either be hard or soft in which the temperature or duration is varied. A hard scald of 58 \u00b0C (136.4 \u00b0F) for 2.5 minutes will remove the epidermis of poultry, and this is commonly used for carcasses that will be frozen so that their appearance is white and attractive.. === Scalding milk === Scalded milk is milk that has been heated to .Rombauer, Irma and Marion Rombauer Becker. The Joy of Cooking. New York: Signet, 1973. . At this temperature, bacteria are killed, enzymes in the milk are destroyed, and many of the proteins are denatured. In cooking, milk is typically scalded to increase its temperature, or to change the consistency or other cooking interactions due to the denaturing of proteins. Recipes that call for scalded milk include caf\u00e9 au lait, baked milk, and ryazhenka. Scalded milk is used in yogurt to make the proteins unfold, and to make sure that all organisms that could out-compete the yogurt culture's bacteria are killed. Milk is both scalded and also cooled in many recipes, such as for bread and other yeast doughs, as pasteurization does not kill all bacteria, and the wild yeasts that may also be present can alter the texture and flavor. In addition, scalding milk improves the rise due to inhibition of bread rise by certain undenatured milk proteins.Corriher, Shirley.
