    "text": "Martin Walser (; born 24 March 1927) is a German writer. ==Life== Detail of the by Peter Lenk (Martin Walser as Bodenseereiter). Walser was born in Wasserburg am Bodensee, on Lake Constance. His parents were coal merchants, and they also kept an inn next to the train station in Wasserburg. He described the environment in which he grew up in his novel Ein springender Brunnen (English: A Gushing Fountain). From 1938 to 1943 he was a pupil at the secondary school in Lindau and served in an anti-aircraft unit. According to documents released in June 2007, at the age of 17 he became a member of the Nazi Party on 20 April 1944,Die Welt: Dieter Hildebrandt soll in NSDAP gewesen sein 30 June 2007 though Walser denied that he knowingly entered the party, a claim disputed by historian Juliane Wetzel.Der Tagesspiegel: Gemeinsam in die NSDAP 22 July 2009Wolfgang Benz, ed.: Wie wurde man Parteigenosse? \u2013 Die NSDAP und ihre Mitglieder (Frankfurt: S. Fischer Verlag, 2009). By the end of the Second World War, he was a soldier in the Wehrmacht. After the war he returned to his studies and completed his Abitur in 1946. He then studied literature, history, and philosophy at the University of Regensburg and the University of T\u00fcbingen. He received his doctorate in literature in 1951 for a thesis on Franz Kafka, written under the supervision of Friedrich Bei\u00dfner. While studying, Walser worked as a reporter for the S\u00fcddeutscher Rundfunk radio station, and wrote his first radio plays. In 1950, he married Katharina \"K\u00e4the\" Neuner-Jehle. He has four daughters from this marriage: Franziska Walser is an actress; Alissa Walser is a writer-and-painter; Johanna Walser, and Theresia Walser are professional writers. Johanna has occasionally published in collaboration with her father. German journalist Jakob Augstein is Walser's illegitimate son from a relationship with translator Maria Carlsson.Gerrit Bartels: Augstein und Walser. Vater und Sohn: Eine gewisse \u00c4hnlichkeit. In: Der Tagesspiegel. 28 November 2009. Retrieved 25 March 2012. Beginning in 1953 Walser was regularly invited to conferences of the Gruppe 47 (Group 47), which awarded him a prize for his story Templones Ende (English: Templone's End) in 1955. His first novel Ehen in Philippsburg (English: Marriages in Philippsburg) was published in 1957 and was a huge success. Since then Walser has been working as a freelance author. His most important work is Ein fliehendes Pferd (English: A Runaway Horse), published 1978, which was both a commercial and critical success. Walser received the Georg B\u00fcchner Prize in 1981. In 2004 Walser left his long-time publisher Suhrkamp Verlag for Rowohlt Verlag after the death of Suhrkamp director Siegfried Unseld. An unusual clause in his contract with Suhrkamp Verlag made it possible for Walser take publishing rights over all of his works with him. According to Walser, a decisive factor in instigating the switch was the lack of active support by his publisher during the controversy over his novel \"Tod eines Kritikers\" (English: Death of a Critic). Walser is a member of Akademie der K\u00fcnste (Academy of Arts) in Berlin, S\u00e4chsische Akademie der K\u00fcnste (Saxon Academy of Arts), Deutsche Akademie f\u00fcr Sprache und Dichtung (German Academy for Language and Poetry) in Darmstadt, and member of the German P.E.N. In 2007 the German political magazine Cicero placed Walser second on its list of the 500 most important German intellectuals, just behind Pope Benedict XVI and ahead of Nobel Prize winner G\u00fcnter Grass. ==Political engagement== Martin Walser at a reading in Germany, 1992 ===From Left to Right=== Walser has also been known for his political activity. In 1964, he attended the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial, which was considered an important moment in the development of West German political consciousness regarding the recent German past. He was involved in protests against the Vietnam War. During the late 1960s, Walser, like many leftist German intellectuals including G\u00fcnter Grass, supported Willy Brandt for the election to the office of chancellor of West Germany. In the 1960s and 1970s Walser moved further to the left and was considered a sympathizer of the West German Communist Party. He was friends with leading German Marxists such as Robert Steigerwald and even visited Moscow during this time. By the 1980s, Walser began shifting back to the political right, though he denied any substantive change of attitude. In 1988 he gave a series of lectures entitled \"Speeches About One's Own Country,\" in which he made clear that he considered German division to be a painful gap which he could not accept. This topic was also the topic of his story \"Dorle und Wolf\". ===Peace Prize of the German Book Trade=== In 1998 Walser was awarded the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade. His acceptance speech, given in the former Church of St. Paul (Paulskirche) in Frankfurt, invoked issues of historical memory and political engagement in contemporary German politics and unleashed a controversy that roiled German intellectual circles. Walser's acceptance speech was titled: (\"Experiences when writing the regular soapbox- speech\"): (Full text in German ) At first the speech did not cause a great stir. Indeed, the audience present in Church of St. Paul received the speech with applause, though Walser's critic Ignatz Bubis did not applaud, as confirmed by television footage of the event.Eshel, Amir: \"Jewish Memories, German Futures: Recent Debates in Germany about the Past\" , page 12. 2000. (PDF-File, 6 MB) Some days after the event, and again on 9 November 1998, the 60th anniversary of the Kristallnacht pogrom against German Jews, Bubis, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, accused Walser of \"intellectual arson\" () and claimed that Walser's speech was both \"trying to block out history or, respectively, to eliminate the remembrance\" and pleading \"for a culture of looking away and thinking away\". Then the controversy started. As described by Karsten Luttmer: Walser replied by accusing Bubis to have stepped out of dialog between people. Walser and Bubis met on 14 December at the offices of the to discuss the heated controversy and to bring the discussion to a close. They were joined by Frank Schirrmacher of the and Salomon Korn of the Central Council of Jews in Germany. Afterward, Bubis withdrew his claim that Walser had been intentionally incendiary, but Walser maintained that there was no misinterpretation by his opponents. ===Death of a Critic=== In his 2002 roman-\u00e0-clef Death of a Critic, Martin Walser attacks violently the most powerful literary critic in Germany, Marcel Reich-Ranicki, a Jew who had escaped the Warsaw ghetto. Walser criticised his person as much as his role as a symbol of a corrupted cultural milieu. This started a scandal, a war between newspapers and a power contest between personalities all played a role. Does a writer, especially one who had been a member of the Nazi party, have the right to attack the most well-known critic in Germany, former head of the arts and culture section of the country's most prestigious newspaper and host of a popular literary television show, a German national for more than fifty years? As soon as the novel came out, this question became the hot topic of debate in Germany. Not a day went by without a newspaper article taking a stance for or against the book. And this with hardly anybody even having read it, because at the time, only a few advance copies were in circulation. His was the first volley in the public debate. On 29 May, months before the book was to be officially released in August, Frank Schirrmacher wrote an open letter to Martin Walser to inform him that contrary to tradition, an excerpt from his book would not be published in the feuilleton of the FAZ: \"This book is an execution, a settlement of accounts, a document of hate\", he wrote. The FAZ continued to publish expressions of support for Marcel Reich-Ranicki, who was Schirrmacher's predecessor at the FAZ. Its arch- rival daily paper, the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung from Munich, closed ranks behind Walser. Reich-Ranicki commented himself in May 2010 in an interview with Der Spiegel: \"I don't think that he is an anti-Semite. But it is important to him to demonstrate that the critic, who allegedly tortured him most, is a Jew, too. He expects his public to follow him in this. You see, there never was an anti-Semitic line or remark from Grass, not one. And I certainly haven't written only positively about his books.\" ==Works== ;In German \u2013 and in English, if translated: *Beschreibung einer Form: Versuch \u00fcber die epische Dichtung Franz Kafkas (1951) *Ein Flugzeug \u00fcber dem Haus und andere Geschichten (1955) *Ehen in Philippsburg (1957) \u2013 The Gadarene Club (1960) *Halbzeit (1960) \u2013 Halftime: A Novel (also 1960) *Eiche und Angora: Eine deutsche Chronik (1962) \u2013 The Rabbit Race (1963) *\u00dcberlebensgro\u00df Herr Krott: Requiem f\u00fcr einen Unsterblichen (1964) *L\u00fcgengeschichten (1964) *Erfahrungen und Leseerfahrungen (1965) *Das Einhorn (1966) \u2013 The Unicorn (1983) *Der Abstecher, Die Zimmerschlacht (1967) *Heimatkunde: Aufs\u00e4tze und Reden (1968) *Ein Kinderspiel: St\u00fcck in zwei Akten (1970) *Fiction: Erz\u00e4hlung (1970) *Aus dem Wortschatz unserer K\u00e4mpfe(1971) *Die Gallistl\u2019sche Krankheit (1972) *Der Sturz (1973) *Das Sauspiel: Szenen aus dem 16.
