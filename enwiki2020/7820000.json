    "text": "Town 102 was a radio station serving Ipswich that was owned by Tindle Radio, Anglian Radio Group and Bauer Radio. It broadcast from 2006 to 2020. Launched in 2006, in its later years, Town 102 carried identical content to Anglian Radio sister stations Dream 100, North Norfolk Radio, Radio Norwich 99.9 and The Beach, with the exception of jingles, adverts and local news and travel. All five radio stations were output from a single system at Radio Norwich 99.9's headquarters. On 12 June 2018 Town 102's licence was not renewed when, for the first time since its inception, Ofcom, did not award a re-advertised licence to the incumbent licensee; reasons cited as factors included Town's refusal to broadcast on DAB and the challenger's proposal to broadcast a more local service. Consequently, Ipswich 102 replaced Town 102 on FM on 19 October 2018. On 1 September 2020, Town 102 and its sister stations were rebranded to Greatest Hits Radio, airing a regional drivetime show. ==Programming== Programmes between 0600 and 1900 Monday to Friday and between 0800 and 1200 on Saturday and Sunday were produced in Norwich. Some programmes outside these times were shared with The Breeze network of radio stations. ==References== ==External links== * Town 102 FM website Category:Radio stations in Suffolk Category:Ipswich Category:Radio stations established in 2006 Category:2006 establishments in England ",
