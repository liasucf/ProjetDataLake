Little is known about Schellinks' life, training or artistic development. While his brother Willem trained as an artist and specialised in atmospheric Italianate pictures, Dani\u00ebl does not appear to have had a formal artistic training. HM Ship Tiger Taking the Schakerloo in the Harbour of Cadiz, 23 February 1674 Both Schellinks brothers visited Italy. Willem Schellinks was in Rome in 1664. When Dani\u00ebl married in 1662 he called himself the owner of a clothier's business.Dani\u00ebl Schellinks, The Ponte Lucano near Tivoli at Master Prints ==Work== Only a few works are securely attributed to Dani\u00ebl Schellinks. They are almost all based on works by his elder brother Willem. Dani\u00ebl's profession was a silk trader and he was only an amateur artist. It is believed that many of his works have been wrongly attributed to other artists. Dani\u00ebl and his brother Willem form part of the Dutch landscape and genre artists active in the 16th and 17th centuries who depicted Italian scenes, either real or imaginary. They are referred to as the 'Italianates'.Sheila D. Muller, Dutch Art: An Encyclopedia, Routledge, 4 July 2013, p. 401 They were influenced by Italian models and attempted to capture the Mediterranean light through a colourful style of painting with delicate atmospheric effects. While a number of the Italianates visited and even worked in Italy, some never did but relied for their Italianate scenes on the works of artists who had in fact been there and had brought the Italianate style to their native country upon their return. The Dutch architectural painter Jan van der Heyden, for instance, likely never visited Italy but is believed to have used some of Dani\u00ebl Schellinks' drawings for his Italianate paintings.Peter C. Sutton, et al., Jan van der Heyden (1637\u20131712) (exhibit catalogue), Yale University Press, 2006, p. 176 View of the Tiber at Trastevere with the Island on the Tiber Like his brother, Dani\u00ebl also painted a few marine scenes.Dani\u00ebl Schellinks at the National Maritime Museum ==References== ==External links== * Category:1627 births Category:1701 deaths Category:Artists from Amsterdam Category:Dutch Golden Age painters Category:Dutch landscape painters Category:Dutch male painters Category:Dutch marine artists ",
