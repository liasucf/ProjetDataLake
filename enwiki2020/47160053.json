    "text": "George Keymas (November 18, 1925 \u2013 January 17, 2008) was an American film and television actor.Martin p.68 Popular pockmarked, American film and television actor began his Hollywood career in 1950, mainly in popular western fare of the day. His first screen appearance was in an uncredited role in the 1950 B-feature film, \u201cI Shot Billy the Kid\u201d, with lead Don 'Red' Barry. Due to his rugged looks, Keymas was cast in ethnic, often Native-American characters, or cow-punching, at times ruthless, cowboys, in countless film/TV westerns. Oddly, likely his most recognizable role was the brief and unrecognizable character as \u2018The Leader\u2019 in the classic TV The Twilight Zone episode \"Eye of the Beholder\", which originally aired November 11, 1960. His freakish ambiguous character was seen throughout the episode on a futuristic big-screen monitor as background sub-plot to the story. In 1969, Keymas played the Ute chief Black Wing in the episode \"A Key for the Fort\" of the syndicated television series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Robert Taylor not long before Taylor's own death. In the episode Eliza Stewart Udall, as Miss Ella Stewart, sends the first telegraph message from Arizona and works with her Aunt Cora (Ivalou Redd) to nurse Black Wing back to health. The episode also stars Gregg Palmer as Jacob. It was filmed at Pipe Spring National Monument in Utah. Ella Stewart is an ancestor of the Udall family of southwestern politics. Keymas's \u2018Indian\u2019 roles came in many other popular TV westerns series of the day such as: Daniel Boone, \u201cDeath Valley Days\u201d, The High Chaparral, Gunsmoke, and Bonanza among many others. ==Selected filmography== * I Shot Billy the Kid (1950) - Murphy's Man (uncredited) * Border Rangers (1950) - Raker - Henchman * Mask of the Avenger (1951) - Austrian Soldier (uncredited) * Actors and Sin (1952) - Producer (segment \"Woman of Sin\") * The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima (1952) - Prisoner (uncredited) * Salome (1953) - Sailor (uncredited) * Siren of Bagdad (1953) - Soradin * Flame of Calcutta (1953) - Prince Jehan * The Robe (1953) - Slave (uncredited) * The Great Adventures of Captain Kidd (1953, Serial) - Sailor in the Argus brig (uncredited) * King of the Khyber Rifles (1953) - Afridi Horseman (uncredited) * Bait (1954) - Chuck * Drums of Tahiti (1954) - Angelo * The Raid (1954) - Captain Dupree (uncredited) * The Black Dakotas (1954) - Spotted Deer (uncredited) * They Rode West (1954) - Torquay (uncredited) * The Bamboo Prison (1954) - Spiros Metaxas (uncredited) * The Prodigal (1955) - Scribe (uncredited) * Stranger on Horseback (1955) - Bannerman's Henchman * Wyoming Renegades (1955) - George Curry * Kentucky Rifle (1955) - Interpreter * Santa Fe Passage (1955) - Chief Satank * Apache Ambush (1955) - Tweedy * The Vanishing American (1955) - Coshanta * Kismet (1955) - Young Policeman (uncredited) * Fury at Gunsight Pass (1956) - Daley * The Maverick Queen (1956) - Muncie * Walk the Proud Land (1956) - Ponce (uncredited) * Thunder Over Arizona (1956) - Harvard 'Shotgun' Kelly * The White Squaw (1956) - Yotah * Utah Blaine (1957) - Rink Witter * The Storm Rider (1957) - Apache Kid * Apache Warrior (1957) - Chato * Plunder Road (1957) - Officer No. 1 (uncredited) * Gunfire at Indian Gap (1957) - Scully * Cole Younger, Gunfighter (1958) - Sgt.
