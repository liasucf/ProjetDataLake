    "text": "Thuliadanta is an extinct genus of ceratomorph perissodactyl closely related to modern tapirs that is known from the early Eocene of Arctic Canada (Nunavut and Northwest Territories). ==Paleogeographic significance== Thuliadenta is known from the highest northern latitudinal region of any extinct tapiroid, indicating a possible North American origin for Tapiroidea. Judging from the use of the mountain tapir as an analogue, Thuliadanta may have been a year- round inhabitant in the mild temperate lowland forests of the Eocene High Arctic.J. J. Eberle. 2005.
