    "text": "In psychology and criminology, Differential K theory is a controversial theory, first proposed by Canadian psychologist J. Philippe Rushton in 1985, which attempts to apply r/K selection theory to human races. According to Rushton, this theory explains race differences in fertility, IQ, criminality, and sexual anatomy and behavior. The theory also hypothesizes that a single factor, the \"K factor\", affects multiple population statistics Rushton referred to as \"life-history traits\". Many researchers have criticised Rushton's theory. It has been argued that the predictions based on the theory \"are supported by selective citation and misrepresentation of the research literature and by the use of unreliable sources\" and that Rushton's methodology \"indicates a lack of familiarity with ecological thinking and scientific method in general.\" Additional criticism of the theory has come from Edward M. Miller, who has argued that contrary to the theory, unpredictable environments select for K, not r, characteristics. In contrast, Donald Templer reported finding evidence in support of the theory's prediction of a \"K factor\" that accounts for numerous life-history traits, such as \"birth rate, infant mortality, HIV/AIDS, general intelligence, and life expectancy.\" A 2012 study analyzing self-reported data found inconsistent evidence in support of the theory. A 2013 study found some support for the theory in regards to the correlation between IQ and two such traits: parental investment and fertility rates. A 2014 study found differences in the General Factor of Personality across races that were not compatible with differential K theory. Another 2014 study reported evidence against the theory with respect to the association between male sexual behavior, social capital, and the favorability of environments. The authors of this study concluded that its results \"corroborate previous findings regarding relationships between reproductive onset and reproductive behavior, but do not provide strong evidence to suggest that these relationships are part of a general 'K-dimension' as predicted by Differential K theory.\" Some researchers have also tried to combine differential k theory with Terrie Moffitt's developmental theory of crime to create what they call a \"unified crime theory\". ==References== Category:Psychological theories Category:Race and intelligence controversy ",
