Accountable Politicians! from January 2019 to September 2019, and had previously been known as Senator Online. == Policies and philosophy == Online Direct Democracy does not have any policies. Instead it has pledged to conduct an online poll for every bill that passes before Parliament. Anyone on the Australian electoral roll would be allowed to register to vote in these polls and will be allowed one vote per bill. The MPs would then be required to vote in accordance with the clear majority (55%-70% and more than 100,000 votes). If there is no clear majority they will abstain from voting. A beta version of the system is operating and available for public use. This system has been designed to highlight the possibilities on online democracy. ==History== The party contested the 2007 and 2013 federal elections as Senator Online. In the five states the party contested in 2007, it received on average 0.06% of the vote (or roughly 6 votes for every 10,000 cast) with the greatest success in Victoria where it received 0.18% of the vote (or roughly 18 votes for every 10,000 cast). Senator Online changed its name in 2015 to Online Direct Democracy. The party has been involved in Glenn Druery's Minor Party Alliance.Bitter dispute erupts over Senate preferences in Queensland: ABC 5 September 2013Alliance of micro parties boosts odds for likes of One Nation or Shooters and Fishers gaining Senate spot through preferences: Daily Telegraph 5 September 2013 In the 2016 federal election Online Direct Democracy fielded two senate candidates in each of New South Wales and Queensland, one senate candidate in the Northern Territory, and House of Representatives candidates in six seats in New South Wales, two in Queensland, one in Western Australia and one in the Northern Territory.
