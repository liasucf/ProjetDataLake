There have been informal meetings between the various state presidents where a national spokesperson for the five separate organisations is appointed.Centenera, Jeff, \"Colours lowered as ACT's flag group ordered to disband\", The Canberra Times, 4 November 2002https://www.australianflag.net.au/ In 2013 an Australian Flag Association was formed, with ANFA Queensland President Allan Pidgeon AM as chair.http://gg.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/honours/ad/ad2017/slkh83xzcb/AM%20Final%20Media%20Notes%20(M-Z).pdf ===New South Wales=== According to their official website ANFA NSW is a non- political, non-sectarian voluntary community service organisation.
