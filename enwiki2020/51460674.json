    "text": "Theme for Monterey is an album by the Gerald Wilson Orchestra recorded in 1997 and released on the MAMA label.Summit Records catalog, accessed August 26, 2016 ==Reception== AllMusic rated the album with 4\u00bd stars; in his review, Scott Yanow noted: \"In 1997, bandleader/arranger Gerald Wilson was commissioned by the Monterey Jazz Festival to write an original piece to be performed at that year's festival. Wilson's goal was to compose a melody that the audience would leave the venue singing to themselves. He succeeded by casting his \"Theme for Monterey\" in five different styles, with his big band interpreting the theme in a variety of moods\u2014as a ballad, a Latin romp, a medium-tempo piece and a shouting conclusion... Highly recommended\". In JazzTimes Bill Bennett wrote: \"Throughout, Wilson's dense orchestrations hinge on sharp accents and grand sweep and provide surging support for strong solos\".Bennett, B.
