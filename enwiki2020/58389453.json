    "text": "Somebody Else's Troubles is an album by singer/songwriter Steve Goodman, released in 1972. The record received favorable reviews but failed to sell. Goodman soon left Buddha Records and signed with Elektra Records.Paste Magazine, Steve Goodman - Unemployed Bob Dylan contributes piano on the title song under the pseudonym of Robert Milkwood Thomas. The album was reissued in 1999 with two additional tracks. ==Reception== Ian Dove of the New York Times wrote, \"Mr. Goodman has been allowed to bring all his influences into the album, and as a result we get a fully rounded portrait of the artist. It is a deceptively casual album\u2014'laid back' in the argot\u2014recorded in Nashville and New York, but which has much strength and realism in its simplicity... Mr. Goodman's accompaniment is also kept simple and direct.\" Robert Christgau assigned it a \"B\" rating, indicating \"...two consecutive songs about racing the sun, which is at least one too many. Tour de force: an a cappella ballad about a Vietnam widow. Arif Mardin found the proper setting for his young man's quaver.\" In reviewing the 1999 reissue, Allmusic critic Sharon Witmer wrote \"This recording presents a good overview of the prodigious talent and gifts that Steve Goodman gave the music world.\" ==Track listing== #\"The Dutchman\" (Michael Peter Smith) \u2013 4:18 #\"Six Hours Ahead of the Sun\" (Steve Goodman) \u2013 4:38 #\"Song for David\" (Goodman) \u2013 3:06 #\"Chicken Cordon Blues\" (Goodman, Paula Ballan, Tony Mandel) \u2013 3:03 #\"Somebody Else's Troubles\" (Goodman) \u2013 3:48 #\"The Loving of the Game\" (Victoria Garvey) \u2013 3:00 #\"I Ain't Heard You Play No Blues\" (Goodman) \u2013 0:56 #\"Don't Do Me Any Favors Anymore\" (Goodman) \u2013 3:33 #\"The Vegetable Song (The Barn Yard Dance)\" (Carl Martin) \u2013 2:38 #\"Lincoln Park Pirates\" (Goodman) \u2013 3:35 #\"The Ballad of Penny Evans\" (Goodman) \u2013 3:37 #:Reissue bonus tracks: #\"I'm My Own Grandpaw\" (Goodman, Moe Jaffe, Dwight Latham) \u2013 3:32 #\"The Auctioneer\" (Leroy Van Dyke, Buddy Black) \u2013 5:08 == Personnel == *Steve Goodman \u2013 vocals, guitar *David Bromberg \u2013 dobro, guitar, mandolin *Steve Burgh \u2013 bass, guitar, mandolin *Hugh McDonald \u2013 bass, guitar *Robert Milkwood Thomas \u2013 piano, backing vocals on \"Somebody Else's Troubles\" *Jeff Gutcheon \u2013 keyboards, piano *Arif Mardin \u2013 piano *Mark Horowitz \u2013 banjo, guitar *Bill Keith \u2013 banjo, pedal steel guitar *Hugh McCracken \u2013 guitar *Jack McGann \u2013 accordion, guitar *Steve Mosley \u2013 drums, body percussion *David Brigati \u2013 backing vocals *Eddie Brigati \u2013 backing vocals *Maria Muldaur \u2013 harmony vocals on \"Don't Do Me Any Favors Anymore\" and \"Somebody Else's Troubles\" *David \"Fathead\" Newman \u2013 saxophone *Jerry Barnham \u2013 flute *Willie Bridges \u2013 saxophone *Larry Packer \u2013 fiddle *Kenny Kosek \u2013 fiddle *Charles McCracken \u2013 cello ===Production=== *Arif Mardin \u2013 producer, remixing *Malcolm Addey \u2013 engineer *Joel Kerr \u2013 engineer *Eddie Youngblood \u2013 engineer *Harry Yarmark \u2013 engineer *Michael O'Sullivan \u2013 photography *Gib Foster \u2013 design ==References== ==External links== *\"Hidden Treasures: Steve Goodman\u2014Somebody Else's Troubles\", The Guardian Category:Steve Goodman albums Category:1972 albums Category:Albums produced by Arif Mardin ",
