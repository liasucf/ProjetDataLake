    "text": "Aquajogging is a cross training and rehabilitation method using low impact resistance training. It is a way to train without impacting joints. Participants wear a flotation device and move in a running motion in the deep end of a pool. Equipment, aside from a pool, can include a flotation belt and weights. It is useful in training for running because the muscles used are similar. == References == Category:Aquatic therapy Category:Hydrotherapy Category:Sports medicine ",
