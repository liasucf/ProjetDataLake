    "text": "The Mapirip\u00e1n massacre was a massacre of civilians that took place in Mapirip\u00e1n, Meta Department, Colombia. The massacre was carried out from July 15 to July 20, 1997, by the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), an outlawed right-wing paramilitary group. On July 12, 1997, two planeloads of paramilitaries arrived at the airport of San Jos\u00e9 del Guaviare, which also served as a base for anti-narcotics police. The paramilitaries then traveled through territories where the Colombian National Army manned checkpoints. On July 15, 1997, the paramilitaries arrived at Mapirip\u00e1n. They used chainsaws and machetes to murder, behead, dismember, and disembowel a number of civilians. Because the bodies were thrown into a river, it is unknown exactly how many people died but the U.S. State Department claimed in 2003 that at least 30 civilians were killed.National Security Archive, August 1, 2003, Robert P. Jackson, Director of Office for Promotion of Human Rights and Democracy, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, http://nsarchive.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/20030801.pdf In proceedings before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the government of Colombia admitted that members of its military forces also played a role in the massacre, through omission.http://www.corteidh.or.cr/docs/casos/articulos/seriec_122_ing.pdf General Jaime Usc\u00e1tegui allegedly ordered local troops under his command to stay away from the area in which the murders were taking place until the paramilitaries finished the massacre and left. Retired General Usc\u00e1tegui was later prosecuted, put on trial, and subsequently acquitted.Human Rights Atrocities Still go Unpunished in Colombia | Rights and Liberties | AlterNet On 25 November 2009, the Superior Tribunal of Bogot\u00e1 revoked the previous sentence, and condemned General Usc\u00e1tegui to 40 years in prison.a\u00f1os de c\u00e1rcel por masacre de Mapirip\u00e1n pagar\u00e1 el general retirado Jaime Usc\u00e1tegui ==Convictions== Jaime Humberto Uscategui, a former army general who had ignored calls for help during the massacre, was arrested in 1999. His trial took place in a military court and he was given forty months in prison for \"omission\" in 2001. On 25 November 2009, the Bogot\u00e1 superior tribunal announced in a ruling of ninety pages that it had passed a forty-year prison sentence on 61-year-old General Uscategui. It was the longest sentence that had ever been given to an army officer in Colombia's history. Uscategui was found guilty of kidnapping, murder, and falsifying public documents. He declared his innocence, saying \"I have the tranquillity of innocence and I also have the tranquillity of proof\". Colonel Hern\u00e1n Orozco, the batallian commander accused of failing to stop the massacre, was also given a forty-year sentence for murder in 2007. == Carecuchillo surrender == One of the paramilitary leaders allegedly responsible for the massacre, Dumas de Jes\u00fas Castillo Guerrero, a.k.a. \"Carecuchillo\", surrendered to authorities on May 20, 2008, after having been considered dead for half a year. ==See also== *List of massacres in Colombia *War on Drugs ==References== ==External links== *Case of the \"Mapirip\u00e1n Massacre\" v.
