    "text": "\"Hollywood\" is a song by American indie rock band Car Seat Headrest. It was released on April 16, 2020, through Matador Records, as the third single from their twelfth studio album, Making a Door Less Open (2020). The song was written and produced by bandleader Will Toledo and drummer Andrew Katz. ==Composition and lyrics== The song had been described by Spin as Car Seat Headrest's \"aim to make a big leap into alternative rock\". The staff further described the song to feature \"familiar heavy riffs\", \"a big hook\" and \"heavy grooves\". Toledo commented that the song was \"about Hollywood as a place where people go to make their fantasies come to life, and they end up exploiting other people and doing terrible things to maintain their fantasy\". In Pitchfork's review of the associated album, critic Ian Cohen described the lyrics as \"Eephus pitch\" and called it \"something that destabilizes through counter-intuitive simplicity\". ==Critical reception== Writing for Pitchfork, Ian Cohen compared the song as Toledo's \"version of Weezer's 'Beverly Hills'\" and described the concept as \"catchy\" and \"banal\". Upon reviewing the associated album, Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone called the track as one of the most \"divisive\". Writing for The Observer, Emily Mackay wrote that the song is \"pleasingly punchy, but brought down by facile lyrics\". In a less positive review, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described the track as Making a Door Less Open's \"dead thud\". Petridis stated: \"a conflation of guitar and raw- throated rapping in which the spirit of 1 Trait Danger seems rather too evident, self-consciously wacky shrieked vocals and all.\" ==Music video== The release of the track was accompanied by an animated music video. It was directed by Sabrina Nichols. In the animated music video, Toledo appears as his alter ego, Trait, wearing a gas mask, as he takes a journey through Hollywood. ==Personnel== Credits adapted from Bandcamp. ;Car Seat Headrest *Will Toledo \u2013 vocals, synths, keyboards, organ, guitar, piano, drum programming *Andrew Katz \u2013 vocals, drums, drum programming *Ethan Ives \u2013 guitars *Seth Dalby \u2013 bass guitar ;Additional musician *Gianni Aiello \u2013 guitar ;Technical *Will Toledo \u2013 production, engineering, mixing *Andrew Katz \u2013 production, mixing, mastering ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |} ==References== Category:2020 singles Category:2020 songs Category:Songs about Los Angeles Category:Matador Records singles ",
