Historically also \u00dctliberg, Utliberg, Uto. Pierer's Universal Lexikon (1864), p. 322. Stumpf Chronik (1548), s.a. 1268: \u00fctliberg am Albi\u00df. The name is derived from that of the castle formerly near the summit, recorded in 1210 as Uotelenburg (destroyed in 1268). The name of the castle is in turn from an Alemannic personal name in Uotal-; the possible connection to Odilo, count of Thurgau between 709 and 736, is a suggestion due to Josef Siegwart, Die Chorherren- und Chorfrauengemeinschaften in der Deutschprachigen Schweiz vom 6. Jahrhundert bis 1160 (1962), 62f.) is a mountain in the Swiss plateau, part of the Albis chain, rising to . The mountain offers a panoramic view of the entire city of Z\u00fcrich and the Lake of Zurich, and lies on the boundary between the city of Z\u00fcrich and the municipalities of Stallikon and Uitikon. The summit, known as Uto Kulm, is in Stallikon. At the summit, there is the Hotel Uto Kulm, together with two towers. One of these is a look-out tower (access costs , rebuilt 1990), whilst the other is the Uetliberg TV-tower (186 m, rebuilt 1990). The summit is easily accessible by train from Z\u00fcrich. Uetliberg railway station lies some from, and below, the summit of the Uetliberg. It is the terminus of the Uetliberg line, and is linked to Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof by S-Bahn Z\u00fcrich service S10. Trains usually run every half-hour, taking 20 minutes. There are numerous walking paths leading up to the top from Albisg\u00fcetli, Triemli or Albisrieden with frequent water fountains and camping spots. Uetliberg also has a downhill mountain bike track which starts in the camping area at the top of the mountain and finishes next to Triemli railway station, also served by the S10. A panoramic footpath leads along the crest of the Albis ridge to Felsenegg, from where the Adliswil-Felsenegg cable car connects to Adliswil and the S4 S-Bahn service in the valley below. The Uetliberg gives its name to the Z\u00fcrich-based Uto section of the Swiss Alpine Club, and hence to the Uto Peak in the Selkirk Mountains of Canada, which was first climbed by members of the Uto section. ==Gallery== File:Uetliberg Aussichtsturm.jpg|Uetliberg look-out tower.
