    "text": "Led Zeppelin's 1971 European Tour was a concert tour of Europe by the English rock band. The tour commenced on 3 May and concluded on 5 July 1971. It included one concert at Liverpool, England, which was a rescheduled date from their preceding tour of the United Kingdom.Led Zeppelin official website: concert summary It is possible that other unverified dates in Europe were also performed during this period.Dave Lewis and Simon Pallett, (1997) Led Zeppelin: The Concert File, London: Omnibus Press, p. 63. Though being very short in duration, this concert tour was well known, primarily because of the extremely violent crowd disturbance which took place at the band's concert at the Vigorelli Velodrome in Milan on 5 July.Led Zeppelin Interview 1971 Led Zeppelin official website: concert summaryChris Welch (1994) Led Zeppelin, London: Orion Books. , p. 63. This festival appearance in front of an audience of 15,000 people was abandoned when hundreds of tear-gas wielding riot police charged into the crowd. The group were forced to leave the stage and many fans were injured. Some of the group's equipment was also damaged in the chaos. The band's singer Robert Plant later recalled: The concert has been described as one of the low points of Led Zeppelin's career, and the band never again returned to Italy.Lewis, Dave and Pallett, Simon (1997) Led Zeppelin: The Concert File, London: Omnibus Press. , p. 63. ==Tour set list== All track written by Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, except where noted.
