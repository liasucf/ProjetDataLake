She founded the Alberta Ballet Company dance company and is considered a pioneer in the field of dance in western Canada. She was born in Edmonton, Alberta, and trained in Scottish dancing as a child. She went on to study ballet. She performed with Boris Volkoff's company, with the National Ballet of Canada and with the ballet corps of Radio City Music Hall in New York City. After suffering an injury, she was forced to retire from dancing in 1954 and trained as a teacher with Gweneth Lloyd. Carse returned to Edmonton, where she taught dance and developed choreography for operas and musical theatre there. With Muriel Taylor, she established a small amateur performing company called Dance Interlude, which was renamed the Edmonton Ballet in 1960 and the Alberta Ballet in 1971. Also in 1971, she established the Alberta Ballet School. She retired as artistic director for the company in 1975, but continued her association with the Alberta Ballet until 1983.

In 2016, Ballet Edmonton's dance facility was renamed the Ruth Carse Centre for Dance in her honour.
