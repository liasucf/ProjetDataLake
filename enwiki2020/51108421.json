    "text": "The 1969\u201370 Pittsburgh Pipers season was the 2nd season of the team in Pittsburgh (third overall) in the American Basketball Association. The Pipers, having moved back to Pittsburgh after one season in Minnesota, faltered without Connie Hawkins (who had went to the Phoenix Suns) alongside injuries and middling attendance. The Pipers lost the first 9 games of the 1970 calendar year, with their biggest win streak being 3 games (done twice). The team finished 8th in points per game (112.4 per game) and points allowed (117 per game). After the season, the team was bought by Haven Industries, Inc. - the owner of the \"Jack Frost\" brand of sugar products. Subsequently, they decided to rebrand the team as the Pittsburgh Condors for the 1970 season. ==Roster== * 15 Larry Bergh - Power forward * 23 / 45 John Brisker - Small forward * -- Steve Chubin - Shooting guard * 13 Warren Davis - Power forward * 12 Dennis Hamilton - Power forward * 12 Art Heyman - Forward / Guard * 13 Stew Johnson - Power forward * 14 Arvesta Kelly - Point guard * 35 Wilbur Kirkland - Forward * 24 Mike Lewis - Center * -- Lonnie Lynn - Small forward * -- Bill McGill - Center * 34 Maurice McHartley - Shooting guard * 22 Barry Orms - Point guard * 21 Craig Raymond - Center * -- John Smith - Center * 11 Justus Thigpen - Shooting guard * 25 George Thompson - Shooting guard * 22 Steve Vacendak - Point guard * 10 Chico Vaughn - Shooting guard * 32 Trooper Washington - Power forward * 44 Charlie Williams - Shooting guard ==Final standings== ===Eastern Division=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" width=\"470\" ! width=\"30%\"|Eastern Division ! width=\"5%\"|W ! width=\"5%\"|L ! width=\"5%\"|PCT ! width=\"7.5%\"|GB |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\"|Indiana Pacers *|| 59 || 25 || .702 | - |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\"|Kentucky Colonels *|| 45 || 39 || .536|| 14.0 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\"|Carolina Cougars *|| 42 || 42 || .500|| 17.0 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\"|New York Nets * || 39 || 45 || .464 || 20.0 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\"|Pittsburgh Pipers || 29 || 55 || .345 || 30.0 |- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\"|Miami Floridians || 23 || 61 || .274 || 36.0 |} ==Awards and honors== 1970 ABA All- Star Game selections (game played on January 24, 1970) * Charlie Williams ==References== * Pipers on Basketball Reference ==External links== * RememberTheABA.com 1969-70 regular season and playoff results * Pipers page Category:Pittsburgh Condors seasons Pittsburgh Pittsburg Pittsburg ",
