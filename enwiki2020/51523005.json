    "text": "The Rheinland-Pf\u00e4lzische Personendatenbank (People database of Rhineland- Palatinate, RPPD) is an internet database with short biographies of people who have lived or worked in Rhineland-Palatinate. It is being edited at four scientific libraries in Rhineland-Palatinate: Rheinische Landesbibliothek Koblenz, Pf\u00e4lzische Landesbibliothek Speyer, Stadtbibliothek Mainz, Stadtbibliothek Trier. The RPPD is hosted by Rheinische Landesbibliothek Koblenz, a facility of the Landesbibliothekszentrums Rheinland-Pfalz. == Content == Research for the Rheinland-Pf\u00e4lzische Bibliographie often results also in biographical data. In 2005 this developed into the idea for a separate database. == Criteria == The criterion for an entry is that a person was born on the territory of today's Rhineland-Palatinate (also before the establishment of the Bundesland in 1946) or has died there or has done some significant work there. Currently (April 2013) around 10,000 people from Roman times onwards are recorded. With authorization by the rights owners data from printed biographical reference works were added.Information on the Rheinland- Pf\u00e4lzische Personendatenbank As far as dead people are concerned, the name registers have been integrated into the biography portal in March 2012.News report by Landesbibliothekszentrum Rheinland-Pfalz A dataset includes the following information (if ascertainable): name forms, sex, life dates, places of life and work, occupations, fields of expertise, relations to other persons (inside and outside of the RPPD), own works, sources, biographical text. All this information can also be researched. == External links == * Rheinland- Pf\u00e4lzische Personendatenbank == References == Category:Online person databases Category:Culture of Rhineland-Palatinate Category:2005 establishments in Germany Category:Internet properties established in 2005 ",
