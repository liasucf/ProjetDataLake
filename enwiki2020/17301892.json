    "text": "This is a list with brief descriptions of Topps sports card products for 1975. ==Baseball== Topps issued two sets in 1975, the base set was the standard 2.5 by size and the \"Mini\" issue which was of an identical design and content, but 20% smaller in size. Topps never released production numbers, but collectors believe that fewer mini cards were produced, making them slightly rarer than the full-sized cards. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !Set !Description !Cards in Set !Size |- |Base set | |660 |2.5 x |- |Mini | |660 |2.125 x |- |} ===Parallel Sets=== Since 1965, the Canadian candy company O-Pee-Chee produced virtually identical, but smaller, sets identical to the Topps issue of the same year.
