    "text": "Hohner Musikinstrumente GmbH & Co. KG is a German manufacturer of musical instruments, founded in 1857 by Matthias Hohner (1833\u20131902). The roots of the Hohner firm are in Trossingen, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Since its foundation, and though known for its harmonicas, Hohner has manufactured a wide range of instruments, such as kazoos, accordions, recorder flutes, melodicas, banjos, electric, acoustic, resonator and classical guitars, basses, mandolins and ukuleles (under the brand name Lanikai) From the 1940s through 1990s, the company also manufactured various electric/electronic keyboards. Especially in the 1960s and 1990s, they manufactured a range of innovative and popular electromechanical keyboard instruments; the cembalet, pianet, basset, guitaret, and clavinet. In the 1980s, several Casio synths were sold under the Hohner brand - for example, the Casio HT-3000/Hohner KS61midi and the VZ-1/HS-2). Nowadays, Hohner produces harmonicas, melodicas, accordions and recorder flutes. ==History== Clock maker Matthias Hohner began crafting harmonicas in 1857, assisted by his wife and a single employee. 650 were made in the first year.How To Play The Hohner 10 Hole Diatonic Harmonica by David Harp Hohner harmonicas quickly became popular, and in his lifetime Matthias built the largest harmonica factory in the world. During the American Civil War, Matthias Hohner distributed harmonicas to family members in the United States who in turn gave them to the soldiers.The House of Blues Radio Hour episode Harmonica Documentary In the 1920s, Hohner began manufacturing chromatic harmonicas, which unlike the \"standard\" diatonic form can be played in any key. Famous harmonicist Borrah Minevitch claimed he sold his design for the chromatic harmonica to Hohner.Playing the Harmonica by Dave Oliver In the mid-1950s, Hohner began producing electric guitars. The company headquarters in Trossingen In 1964 Hohner released \"The Beatles Harmonica Kit\" which was sold in a blister package, much like most Hohner harmonicas nowadays, retailed for $2.95, and help what Hohner calls \"bring about a new popularity upsurge of the Hohner harmonica on both sides of the Atlantic.\". In the 1970s Hohner began manufacturing acoustic guitars, and re-producing electric guitars. Musician Prince almost always played a Hohner \"Mad Cat\" and it was said to have been his favourite guitar. This Electric Guitar was modelled on the \u2018HS Anderson Mad Cat\u2019 and was essentially a Telecaster. Matthias Karl Hohner, son of and a direct descendant in fourth generation and name bearer of the founder , was one of the last members of the Hohner dynasty involved in managing the family business, between 1968 and 1986. His son Matthias Francisco Hohner belonged to the first generation of direct descendants who did not enter into the family business. Many direct descendants of the founder are still active as members of the \"Deutsches Harmonika Museum\" and the \"Hohner'sche Familienverein\". ==Subdivisions== ===Marine Band=== \"The Marine Band\" is the base model of the line. Technically named the Marine Band 1896/20 for the year it was introduced and the twenty reeds it possesses, it has been the basis of a number of Hohner's harmonicas over the years. It also has some tuning variations like the 1896N (natural minor key) and the 1896H (harmonic minor key). The Marine Band has been Hohner's most popular model of harmonica for generations. Made in Germany on a wood comb, most blues and rock artists play a Marine Band. Several noted users are Bob Dylan, John Lennon, Bruce Springsteen, Little Walter and Neil Young. There are various subdivisions of the Marine Band. The Special 20 (#560) was introduced in the mid 1970s. It has the same reeds as a Marine Band, but it has a plastic comb instead of a wooden comb, and rounded edges. It was the first Hohner harmonica to have a plastic comb, which not only made the instrument more airtight, but also eliminated the swelling wood combs go through as they moisten from use. Made in Germany, this model quickly became the preferred choice of many rock and blues players. Now, most harmonicas being manufactured from all companies are based upon the Special 20. Its most noted user is John Popper, who appears on the blister. Like the 1896, the Special 20 also has tuning variations available, like the #560C in country styled tuning, and the #560N in natural minor. The Marine Band Deluxe has all the features of the original Marine Band with tighter construction and a new cover design which creates a greater volume. The Marine Band Crossover also features the same reeds, but is made on a bamboo comb that is water repellent. The Marine Band Thunderbird is a model of low and super- low pitched 10-hole diatonic harmonica that was introduced in 2011. It possesses a bamboo comb like the Crossover, and a conical shaped lower cover plate. Designed by noted harmonica player and customizer Joe Filisko, this plate helps reduce any rattle caused by the low frequency tone produced by the reeds. It is available in low major keys A through F, as well as low B-flat and E-flat, and double-low F. The Marine Band 364 has twelve holes and is available is the natural keys of C, G, and D only. The Marine Band 365 has fourteen holes and is available in keys C and G only. The Marine Band Soloist (364s) is the same as a twelve-hole chromatic harmonica without a button. Available in key of C. The Marine Band 365 Steve Baker Special (365/28 SBS) possesses the same construction as the original 365, but with low pitched tuning to their natural major keys, available in C, D, G, A, and F. It is named for, and was developed in part by noted harmonicist Steve Baker, who resides in Germany and has contributed to the design of several other Hohner harmonica models, including the Marine Bands Deluxe and Crossover. The Marine Band Octave has two rows of reeds tuned an octave apart. Available in the keys of C and G. == \"Modular\" harmonica system == In the mid-1990s, responding to the competing new Lee Oskar Harmonica System by Tombo, Hohner introduced an interchangeably parted series known as the Modular System, usually abbreviated MS. Over the years, several harps have been added to this system. The Blues Harp has been around since the early 1970s. Until the 1990s, it was functionally identical to the Marine Band, the only differences being the cover plates and the varnish on the front of the wood comb, and the Blues Harp's profile was thinner as well. At one point, Johnny Cash promoted the Blues Harp. In the 1990s, Hohner made the Blues Harp part of its Modular System (MS) line. This new Blues Harp lost its uniqueness, and is interchangeable with the other models in the MS line, but it currently remains the standby of many players who use MS harps. The Pro Harp features lacquer- coated cover plates with a glossy black finish and a plastic comb. Since its inception, it has become a very popular model among rock and roll players. The Pro Harp was another model that was in Hohner's handmade line of harmonicas, and was later adapted to the modular system. The Cross Harp was a nearly identical model to the Pro Harp with the exception of a wood comb and slightly thicker original reed plates. The black coverplate coating was greblon. It was discontinued in 2011. The Big River Harp was introduced as a less expensive alternative to the Blues Harp. It is favored among beginner harmonicists, although many experienced players also prefer the Big River for its higher natural volume. It features a plastic comb and bare metal cover plates. The Blue Midnight was released in 2011 with a limit to the key of C, also on the less expensive side of the market. It features stainless steel cover plates with a wider back gap for enhanced volume while playing. The unique feature of this harp is the comb, which is made out of translucent blue plastic. The comb allows for brighter tone than the black combed models. It also has a special just intonation (JI) \"Chicago tuning\". It is also now available in other keys.http://www.hohnerusa.com/index.php?1945 The 225 - Deuce and a Quarter was a limited edition harmonica on the modular system that was put out in 2007 and 2008. It was made on a black plastic comb, with chrome-plated reedplates, and black powder-coated coverplates with art resembling a vintage car's hood- emblem. It was available only in the key of A. The Meisterklasse is a high-end harmonica featuring chrome-plated cover plates, an anodized aluminium comb, and extra thick 1.05mm nickel-plated reeds. Originally issued as a more compact, unique model, the revised version (still carrying the same 580 model number) is now on the modular system, made in Germany. One other feature that sets the Meisterklasse apart from most other Hohner harmonicas are its full- length cover plates, which extend all the way to the ends of the harmonica's comb rather than sharply angling down before the ends to form an adjoining surface parallel to the reedplates and comb. The only other Hohner harmonica possessing this quality is the curve-framed Golden Melody. ==Other diatonic harmonica models== The Old Standby is another model beloved by generations of harmonica players. Up until the 1990s, this model was a quality instrument made in Germany on a wood comb. Where the Marine Band was the choice of blues players, many country music players such as Charlie McCoy preferred the Old Standby. In the 1990s, Hohner began manufacturing this model in China on a plastic comb with a significant decrease in quality. Among harmonica fans the downgrade remains unpopular. Golden Melody, designed by Frank and Cham-Ber Huang, has a curved shape. This German-made, plastic-comb model has a slightly different tuning (equal temperament) than other diatonic harmonicas, making the Golden Melody better suited for playing single-note melodies and solos. The XB-40, (short for Extreme bending-40 reeds), is unlike any other diatonic made. Released in 2003, it was specifically designed by harmonica specialist Rick Epping to simplify proficient bending of the notes. To make this possible, the XB-40 uses forty reeds as opposed to the usual twenty found in most ten-hole diatonics. With these bending capabilities, the XB-40 gives access to all the notes on the chromatic scale through bending the natural tones of each hole. This model was discontinued in 2013. Shortly before production officially ceased, Suzuki Music released a similar model the SUB-30. The American Ace has been a popular choice as a beginner's harmonica for decades. Originally made in Ireland on a wood comb, this model is currently being made in China on a plastic comb. The Pocket Pal is a recent addition to the Hohner standard line of harmonicas. It is somewhat unusual because it is slightly shorter in length than most harmonicas, leading to its namesake of being pocket handy. It is Chinese made, which is unfavorable to most harmonica players, but the Pocket Pal has caught on as an inexpensive, yet quality harp. Like the Old Standby, the Pocket Pal is designed for use in country music. 38C, also known as the Mini Harp, is Hohner's least expensive model. With four holes, the 38C plays a single octave in the key of C. Like other budget harmonicas, the 38C is manufactured in China with a plastic comb. The Little Lady is very similar to the 38C, but on a pearwood comb and with different cover plate art. It is technically a playable harmonica, but it is generally regarded as a knick-knack piece that can be used as personal jewelry. It is also available as a keychain. The Little Lady holds the distinction of being the first musical instrument to be played in outer space. ==Other harmonica types== In addition to diatonic harmonicas Hohner also produces other types such as chromatic and tremolo harmonicas. ===Chromatic=== Hohner \"Super Chromonica\"; case marked \"No.260 1/2\" (model); images top-to- bottom show the case top, harmonica top, case bottom, and harmonica bottom/obverse The Chromonica, no longer in production, contained forty reeds and played 2\u00bd full chromatic octaves. This was the original Hohner chromatic model, available until recently in C or G. The Discovery 48 an entry level chromatic harmonica, aimed at beginners. Contains forty-eight reeds featuring full length cover plates, the same 1.2mm reeds found in the deluxe and a reversible mouth piece. There is also a Super Chromonica 270 which contains forty-eight reeds and spans three octaves. The Super Chromonica 270 Deluxe is an updated improvement on the Super Chromonica, featuring tighter reedplate fixtures, thicker reedplates, round holes in its chrome-plated mouthpiece, a smoother slide mechanism which can be remounted for left-handed use, and a round-edged comb for more comfortable holding. The Deluxe is also available with a gold-plated mouthpiece and coverplates, known as the Super Chromonica Gold. The Educator 10 is a 10-hole, 40-reed chromatic harmonica built on a plastic comb. It is designed without the valve or windsaver technology found in many other chromatics, and because of its ten holes, it is smaller than most chromatics. This makes it a simple and inexpensive chromatic, ideal both for novices and for experienced diatonic players making the transition from the smaller 10-hole harmonicas. Like the Chromonica, it plays full octaves. The Koch Chromatic and Slide Harp are both designed in the same fashion as chromatic harmonicas, but possess the Richter tuning found in typical 10-hole diatonic harmonicas. Like the Educator 10, both are also 10-hole and built on a pearwood comb. The Slide Harp has been discontinued. The 64 Chromonica is a four-full-octave harmonica in the key of C. With 64 reeds on a plastic comb, it boasts an extra octave below the middle-C note, giving it an accentuated versatility. The CX-12 is a 12-hole, 48-reed chromatic, uniquely designed with a one-piece plastic housing and a more ergonomic slide button. It is available in several keys including a tenor-C. The standard model is charcoal black in color, but a gold colored one is available in the key of C only. A variant of the CX-12, the CX-12 Jazz, has slightly different outer body features for better ergonomics, a red and gold colored housing, and higher reed offsets which aid in better tone for jazz harmonica players. The Meisterklasse chromatic is a very high-end model (7565). It\u2019s Hohner\u2019s premium 14-hole chromatic (56 notes). Like its diatonic sibling, it features an anodized aluminum comb, and chrome-plated brass cover plates and mouthpiece. https://www.hohner.de/fileadmin/documents/instruments/harmonicas/hohner- harmonicas-catalog.pdf The cover plates extend the length of the comb. Essentially, it looks like a bigger version of the original diatonic Meisterklasse introduced in the 1980s (but which was later revised for the MS series reed plates). ===Tremolo=== On tremolo harmonicas each channel has two reeds for each note, i.e. one pair for blown notes and another pair for drawn ones, each pair tuned slightly apart from one another to produce a tremolo sound. The most popular models are either single-sided or double-sided Echo harps, but the single-sided ones can be combined into quadruple or sextuple 'corncob' setups, with a different key on each row. ===Chord=== The Chord Harmonica consists of two harmonicas hinged together. Together, they are capable of playing 48 chords. They are 23 inches long, and each chord takes up 4 holes. The chord harmonica is used to provide chordal and rhythmic backing in an ensemble, much as rhythm guitar might do. Jerry Murad's Harmonicat's 1947 \"Peg O' My Heart\" was played on a Chord, with a cleverly arranged sequence of chords that produced the impression of a melody. Hohner's main Chord is known as the Hohner 48, because it plays 48 chords. Hohner from the 1930s to the late 1960s also produced the Polyphonia No. 8, which played 36 blow-only chords, in three rows. The concept failed and is often frowned upon by professional 48 chord players. ===Polyphonia and Chromatica=== Another form of harmonica is the Chromatica and Polyphonia harmonica. Basically identical in design, the Polyphonia (often shortened to \"Poly\") and Chromatica harmonicas have all notes in a row in chromatic scale, side by side. ===150th anniversary and beyond=== 150 Anniversary Gold 42 of 150 For Hohner's 150th anniversary in 2007, the company began manufacturing Limited Edition Diatonic harmonicas all tuned to the key of C major only. * Gold limited to 150 pieces. * Chrome limited to 1,857 pieces. * Standard Edition The \"Gold Edition\" harmonica is based upon the MS reed plates. It features a crystal glass comb and engraved gold-plated cover plates. The bottom cover plate has the serial numbers from 1 to 150. It is packaged in a leather case with an anniversary booklet. The \"Chrome Edition\" harmonica is also based upon the MS reed plates. Featuring a crystal glass comb and specially engraved chrome-plated anniversary cover plates. The bottom cover plate has the serial numbers from 1 to 1857. It is also packaged with an anniversary booklet. The \"Standard Edition\" model features a clear acrylic comb and the top cover plate is specially engraved. The \"Standard Edition\" model is presented in 12 piece wooden anniversary boxes. ==Artist series harmonicas== Hohner has several harmonicas designed by several famous harmonica players. ===Larry Adler=== Classical harmonica player Larry Adler had his own harmonica series, still produced by the company, which were chromatic with either 12 or 16 holes. ===Toots Thielemans=== Jazz player Toots Thielemans also has a chromatic harmonica line with two types being Mellow Tone (for classical material) and Hard Bopper (for contemporary material). ===Stevie Wonder=== Stevie Wonder, plays both Hohner the 64 Chromonica and Super 64 with four-octave range on all his records since the 1960s. Besides Toots he's the most copied player worldwide. ===Steven Tyler=== Aerosmith's front man Steven Tyler has two types of diatonic harmonica(s). An Artist Series and a Signature Series with the latter being more expensive. ===Bob Dylan=== folk musician Bob Dylan also has a Signature Series diatonic harmonica as well as a Collection which features seven harmonicas. ==Accordions== The Hohner Electravox is an electronic accordion made in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which has one channel (combined left hand and right hand) or two channel (separate left hand and right hand channels, which enables independent volume changes), 92 bass/chord buttons, keyboard percussion effect for the bass buttons and keyboard, a vibrato effect (with slow/fast options), and a separate power supply unit, which sits on the floor. The Electravox had 16', 8', 5 1/3', and 4' registers. The tuning for the Electravox could be changed to match another instrument, such as a piano or organ, but this required changing all 12 master tone generators with a special tool. == Notable Hohner players == A number of early blues harmonica players throughout the 20th century have been known for using Hohner Marine Band harmonicas because they were the most available at the time. However, as other harmonica companies began to expand and Hohner produced different types of harmonicas, harmonica players started to develop preferences. *Carlos del Junco \u2013 The blues harmonica player is noted for playing a Golden Melody like his mentor Howard Levy. *Howard Levy \u2013 The multigenre harmonica player is noted for playing several different brands but says the Golden Melody is his favorite. *Jerry Portnoy \u2013 The blues harmonica player is primarily a Hohner Marine Band Crossover player since it came out and has given it much praise. He has played with artists such as Bonnie Raitt, Eric Clapton, Muddy Waters, as well as others. *John Popper \u2013 The lead singer of the jam band Blues Traveler is noted for playing a Special 20. *Brandon Santini - The blues, roots-rock harmonica player and vocalist is endorsed by Hohner and plays Hohner Special 20 and Hohner Rocket harmonicas. *John Sebastian, Sr. \u2013 The late classical harmonica virtuoso was noted for playing a 64 Chromonica. He also worked on improvements to its lower register as a consultant for Hohner.Field, Kim. Harmonicas, Harps and Heavy Breathers: The Evolution of the People's Instrument. Cooper Square Press, 2000 (updated edition), p. 291. . *John Sebastian \u2013 The folk, rock and blues harmonica player has primarily played both Hohner Meisterklasse and Marine Band harmonicas, sometimes with customizations. *Neil Young \u2013 The rock, country and folk harmonica player is known to play a Hohner Marine Band in the key of G. ==References== ==External links== * Official website * NAMM Oral History Interview with Past President, Horst Mucha (2004) * The Harmonica Company - Worldwide Hohner Harmonicas Retailer * Category:Musical instrument manufacturing companies of Germany Category:Harmonica manufacturers Category:Guitar manufacturing companies Category:Companies based in Baden- W\u00fcrttemberg Category:Mandolin makers ",
