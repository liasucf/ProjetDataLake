    "text": "The 2016\u201317 Rugby Pro D2 was the second-level French rugby union club competition, behind the Top 14, for the 2016\u201317 season. It ran alongside the 2016\u201317 Top 14 competition; both competitions are operated by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR). ==Teams== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"70%\" |- !width=\"20%\"|Club !! width=\"24%\"|City !! width=\"22%\"|Stadium !! width=\"9%\" | Capacity |- | SU Agen Lot-et-Garonne | Agen (Lot-et-Garonne) | Stade Armandie | align=center | 14,000 |- | SC Albi | Albi (Tarn) | Stadium Municipal d'Albi | align=center | 13,000 |- | Stade Aurillacois Cantal Auvergne | Aurillac (Cantal) | Stade Jean Alric | align=center | 9,000 |- | AS B\u00e9ziers H\u00e9rault | B\u00e9ziers (H\u00e9rault) | Stade de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e | align=center | 18,500 |- | Biarritz Olympique | Biarritz (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques) | Parc des Sports Aguil\u00e9ra | align=center | 15,000 |- | CS Bourgoin-Jallieu | Bourgoin- Jallieu (Is\u00e8re) | Stade Pierre Rajon | align=center | 10,000 |- | US Carcassonne | Carcassonne (Aude) | Stade Albert Domec | align=center | 10,000 |- | US Colomiers | Colomiers (Haute-Garonne) | Stade Michel Bendichou | align=center | 11,400 |- | US Dax | Dax (Landes) | Stade Maurice Boyau | align=center | 16,170 |- | US Montauban | Montauban (Tarn-et-Garonne) | Stade Sapiac | align=center | 12,600 |- | Stade Montois | Mont-de-Marsan (Landes) | Stade Guy Boniface | align=center | 22,000 |- | RC Narbonne | Narbonne (Aude) | Parc des Sports Et de l'Amiti\u00e9 | align=center | 12,000 |- | Oyonnax Rugby | Oyonnax (Ain) | Stade Charles-Mathon | align=center | 11,400 |- | USA Perpignan | Perpignan (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales) | Stade Aim\u00e9 Giral | align=center | 16,600 |- | Soyaux Angoul\u00eame XV Charente | Angoul\u00eame (Charente) | Stade Chanzy | align=center | 6,000 |- | Rugby Club Vannes | Vannes (Morbihan) | Stade de la Rabine | align=center | 9,500 |} Changes in the lineup from 2015\u201316 were: * Lyon won the 2015\u201316 Pro D2 title and were thereby automatically promoted to the Top 14. Bayonne won the promotion playoffs to secure the second promotion place. * The bottom finisher in 2015\u201316, Provence Rugby was relegated from Pro D2 to F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 1. Tarbes was also relegated for financial reasons. * The two bottom finishers in the 2015\u201316 Top 14 season, Oyonnax and Agen, were relegated to Pro D2. * Soyaux Angoul\u00eame and Vannes won the F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 1 promotion playoffs. The 2015\u201316 season was the first in which the promotion playoffs were separated from those for the traditional F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 1 championship prize, Troph\u00e9e Jean-Prat. ==Competition format== The top team at the end of the regular season (after all the teams played one another twice, once at home, once away), is declared champion and earns a spot in the next Top 14 season. Teams ranked second to fifth compete in promotion playoffs, with the semifinals being played at the home ground of the higher- ranked team. The final is then played on neutral ground, and the winner earns the second ticket to the next Top 14. The LNR uses a slightly different bonus points system from that used in most other rugby competitions. It trialled a new system in 2007\u201308 explicitly designed to prevent a losing team from earning more than one bonus point in a match, a system that also made it impossible for either team to earn a bonus point in a drawn match. LNR chose to continue with this system for subsequent seasons. France's bonus point system operates as follows: * 4 points for a win. * 2 points for a draw. * 1 bonus point for winning while scoring at least 3 more tries than the opponent. This replaces the standard bonus point for scoring 4 tries regardless of the match result. * 1 bonus point for losing by 5 points (or less). The required margin had been 7 points or less until being changed in advance of the 2014\u201315 season. The 2016\u201317 season was the last for the then-current Pro D2 promotion system. From 2017\u201318 forward, Pro D2 will institute a playoff system identical to the one currently used in Top 14, with the top six teams qualifying for the playoffs and the top two teams receiving byes into the semifinals. The league championship and automatic promotion place will go to the winner of the playoffs; the runner-up will enter a playoff with the second-from-bottom Top 14 team, with the winner of that playoff taking up the final place in Top 14 for the following season. ==Table== ==Relegation== Normally, the teams that finish in 15th and 16th places in the table are relegated to F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 1 at the end of the season. In certain circumstances, \"financial reasons\" may cause a higher-placed team to be demoted instead, or prevent one of the two finalists in F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 1 from promotion. ==Fixtures== ===Round 1=== ===Round 2=== ===Round 3=== ===Round 4=== ===Round 5=== ===Round 6=== ===Round 7=== ===Round 8=== ===Round 9=== ===Round 10=== ===Round 11=== ===Round 12=== ===Round 13=== ===Round 14=== ===Round 15=== ===Round 16=== ===Round 17=== ===Round 18=== ===Round 19=== ===Round 20=== ===Round 21=== ===Round 22=== ===Round 23=== ===Round 24=== ===Round 25=== ===Round 26=== ===Round 27=== ===Round 28=== ===Round 29=== ===Round 30=== ==Play\u2013offs== The highest ranked team at the end of the regular season, Oyonnax Rugby, earned automatic promotion to the Top 14 as champion de France de PRO D2 2017. ===Semi\u2013finals=== The semi\u2013finals followed a 2 v 5, 3 v 4 system, with the higher ranked team playing at home. \\---- ===Final=== The winners of the semi\u2013finals played off for the second promotion spot to the Top 14. ==Leading scorers== Note: Flags to the left of player names indicate national team as has been defined under World Rugby eligibility rules, or primary nationality for players who have not yet earned international senior caps.
