Aircraft manufacturer A.V. Roe and Company (Avro) designed the Vulcan in response to Specification B.35/46. Of the three V bombers produced, the Vulcan was considered the most technically advanced and hence the riskiest option. Several reduced-scale aircraft, designated Avro 707, were produced to test and refine the delta wing design principles. The Vulcan B.1 was first delivered to the RAF in 1956; deliveries of the improved Vulcan B.2 started in 1960. The B.2 featured more powerful engines, a larger wing, an improved electrical system and electronic countermeasures (ECM); many were modified to accept the Blue Steel missile. As a part of the V-force, the Vulcan was the backbone of the United Kingdom's airborne nuclear deterrent during much of the Cold War. Although the Vulcan was typically armed with nuclear weapons, it was capable of conventional bombing missions, a capability which was used in Operation Black Buck during the Falklands War between the United Kingdom and Argentina in 1982. The Vulcan had no defensive weaponry, initially relying upon high-speed high-altitude flight to evade interception. Electronic countermeasures were employed by the B.1 (designated B.1A) and B.2 from circa 1960. A change to low-level tactics was made in the mid-1960s. In the mid-1970s nine Vulcans were adapted for maritime radar reconnaissance operations, redesignated as B.2 (MRR). In the final years of service six Vulcans were converted to the K.2 tanker configuration for aerial refuelling. After retirement by the RAF, one example, B.2 XH558, named The Spirit of Great Britain, was restored for use in display flights and air shows, whilst two other B.2s, XL426 and XM655, have been kept in taxiable condition for ground runs and demonstrations at London Southend Airport and Wellesbourne Mountford Airfield respectively. B.2 XH558 flew for the last time in October 2015, before also being kept in taxiable condition at Doncaster Sheffield Airport. ==Development== ===Origins=== Avro 710 The origin of the Vulcan and the other V bombers is linked with early British atomic weapon programme and nuclear deterrent policies. Britain's atom bomb programme began with Air Staff Operational Requirement OR.1001 issued in August 1946. This anticipated a government decision in January 1947 to authorise research and development work on atomic weapons, the U.S. Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) having prohibited exporting atomic knowledge, even to countries that had collaborated on the Manhattan Project.Wynn 1997, pp. 7, 16. OR.1001 envisaged a weapon not to exceed in length, in diameter and in weight. The weapon had to be suitable for release from .Wynn 1997, p. 18. In January 1947, the Ministry of Supply distributed Specification B.35/46 to UK aviation companies to satisfy Air Staff Operational Requirement OR.229 for \"a medium range bomber landplane capable of carrying one bomb to a target from a base which may be anywhere in the world.\" A cruising speed of at heights between was specified. The maximum weight when fully loaded ought not to exceed . In addition to a \"special\" (i.e., atomic) bomb, the aircraft was to be capable of alternatively carrying a conventional bomb load of . The similar OR.230 required a \"long range bomber\" with a radius of action with a maximum weight of when fully loaded; this requirement was considered too exacting.Wynn 1997, pp. 44\u201346. A total of six companies submitted technical brochures to this specification, including Avro.Wynn 1997, p. 47. Required to tender by the end of April 1947, work began on receipt of Specification B.35/46 at Avro, led by technical director Roy Chadwick and chief designer Stuart Davies; the type designation was Avro 698. It was obvious to the design team that conventional aircraft could not satisfy the specification; knowing little about high-speed flight and unable to glean much from the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) or the US, they investigated German Second World War swept wing research. The team estimated that an otherwise conventional aircraft, with a swept wing of 45\u00b0, would have doubled the weight requirement. Realising that swept wings increase longitudinal stability, the team deleted the tail (empennage) and the supporting fuselage, it thus became a swept-back flying wing with only a rudimentary forward fuselage and a fin (vertical stabilizer) at each wingtip. The estimated weight was now only 50% over the requirement; a delta shape resulted from reducing the wingspan and maintaining the wing area by filling in the space between the wingtips, which enabled the specification to be met.Gunston, W.T. \"The Vulcan Story.\" Flight, 31 January 1958, p. 143. Though Alexander Lippisch is generally credited as the pioneer of the delta wing, Chadwick's team had followed its own logical design process.Laming 2002, pp. 23, 24. The initial design submission had four large turbojets stacked in pairs buried in the wing either side of the centreline. Outboard of the engines were two bomb-bays. In August 1947, Chadwick was killed in the crash of the Avro Tudor 2 prototype and was succeeded by Sir William Farren.Laming 2002, p. 26. Reductions in wing thickness made it impossible to incorporate the split bomb bays and stacked engines, thus the engines were placed side by side in pairs either side of a single bomb-bay, with the fuselage growing somewhat. The wingtip fins gave way to a single fin on the aircraft's centreline. Rival manufacturer Handley Page received a prototype contract for its crescent-winged HP.80 B.35/46 tender in November 1947. Though considered the best option, contract placement for Avro's design was delayed whilst its technical strength was established.Buttler 2003, p. 31. Instructions to proceed with the construction of two Avro 698 prototypes was received in January 1948. As an insurance measure against both radical designs failing, Short Brothers received a contract for the prototype SA.4 to the less-stringent Specification B.14/46; the SA.4, later named Sperrin, was not required. In April 1948, Vickers also received authority to proceed with their Type 660 which, although falling short of the B.35/46 Specification, being of a more conventional design would be available sooner; this plane entered service as the Valiant.Wynn 1997, pp. 52\u201354. ===Avro 707 and Avro 710=== The prototype Vulcans (VX777 front, VX770 rear) with four Avro 707s at the Farnborough Air Show in September 1953. The large delta wings of the Vulcan quickly gave it the affectionate nickname of 'Tin Triangle'. As Avro had no flight experience of the delta wing, the company planned two smaller experimental aircraft based on the 698, the one- third scale model 707 for low-speed handling and the one-half scale model 710 for high-speed handling. Two of each were ordered. However, the 710 was cancelled when it was considered too time-consuming to develop; a high-speed variant of the 707 was designed in its place, the 707A.Laming 2002, p. 27. The first 707, VX784, flew in September 1949 but crashed later that month killing Avro test pilot Flt Lt Eric Esler. The second low-speed 707, VX790, built with the still uncompleted 707A's nose section (containing an ejection seat)Laming 2002, p. 29. and redesignated 707B, flew in September 1950 piloted by Avro test pilot Wg Cdr Roland \"Roly\" Falk. The high speed 707A, WD480, followed in July 1951.Blackman 2007, p. 21. Due to the delay of the 707 programme, the contribution of the 707B and 707A towards the basic design of the 698 was not considered significant,Laming 2002, p. 32. though it did highlight a need to increase the length of the nosewheel to give a ground incidence of 3.5 degrees, the optimum take-off attitude.Blackman 2007, p. 33. The 707B and 707A proved the design's validity and gave confidence in the delta planform. A second 707A, WZ736 and a two-seat 707C, WZ744 were also constructed but they played no part in the 698's development. ===Vulcan B.1 and B.2=== ====Prototypes and type certification==== More influential than the 707 in the 698's design was wind-tunnel testing performed by the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, which indicated the need for a wing redesign to avoid the onset of compressibility drag which would have restricted the maximum speed.Laming 2002, p. 43. Painted gloss white, the 698 prototype VX770 flew for the first time on 30 August 1952 piloted by Roly Falk flying solo. The prototype 698, then fitted with only the first-pilot's ejection seat and a conventional control wheel, was powered by four Rolls-Royce RA.3 Avon engines of thrust; there were no wing fuel tanks, temporary tankage was carried in the bomb bay.Blackman 2007, pp. 38, 40. VX770 made an appearance at the 1952 Society of British Aircraft Constructors' (SBAC) Farnborough Air Show the next month when Falk demonstrated an almost vertical bank.Hamilton-Paterson 2010, pp. 18\u201319. After its Farnborough appearance, the future name of the Avro 698 was a subject of speculation; Avro had strongly recommended the name Ottawa, in honour of the company's connection with Avro Canada. Weekly magazine Flight suggested Albion after rejecting Avenger, Apollo and Assegai. The chief of the air staff preferred a V-class of bombers, and the Air Council announced the following month that the 698 would be called Vulcan after the Roman god of fire and destruction.Brookes and Davey 2009, p. 8. In January 1953, VX770 was grounded for the installation of wing fuel tanks, Armstrong Siddeley ASSa.6 Sapphire engines of thrust and other systems; it flew again in July 1953.Blackman 2007, p. 41. Comparison of Vulcan wing designs The second prototype, VX777, flew in September 1953. More representative of production aircraft, it was lengthened to accommodate a longer nose undercarriage leg, featured a visual bomb-aiming blister under the cabin and was fitted with Bristol Olympus 100 engines of thrust. At Falk's suggestion, a fighter-style control stick replaced the control wheel. Both prototypes had almost pure delta wings with straight leading edges. During trials in July 1954, VX777 was substantially damaged in a heavy landing at Farnborough. It was repaired and fitted with Olympus 101 engines of thrust before resuming trials in October 1955. While exploring the high speed and high altitude flight envelope, mild buffeting and other undesirable flight characteristics were experienced while approaching the speed of sound, including an alarming tendency to enter an uncontrollable dive, unacceptable to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE;) at Boscombe Down. The solution included the \"phase 2\" wing, featuring a kinked and drooped leading edge and vortex generators on the upper surface, first tested on 707A WD480. An auto-mach trimmer was introduced to give a nose-up pitching moment, but more than was necessary just to counteract the diving tendency, so that the control column had to be pushed rather than pulled to maintain level flight. This artificial pitch-up made the Vulcan appear more like other aircraft as the speed increased.Blackman 2007, pp. 82/83 Meanwhile, the first production B.1, XA889, had flown in February 1955 with the original wing.Blackman 2007, p. 48. In September 1955, Falk, flying the second production B.1 XA890, amazed crowds at the Farnborough Air Show by executing a barrel rollBlackman 2007, pp. 128\u2013129. on his second flypast in front of the SBAC president's tent. After two days flying, he was called in front of service and civil aviation authorities and ordered to refrain from carrying out this \"dangerous\" manoeuvre. Now fitted with a phase 2 wing, XA889 was delivered in March 1956 to the A&AEE; for trials for the type's initial Certificate of Airworthiness which it received the following month.Laming 2002, p. 48. ====Further developments==== The first 15 B.1s were powered by the Olympus 101 with thrust. Many of these early examples in a metallic finish remained the property of the Ministry of Supply being retained for trials and development purposes. Those entering RAF service were delivered to No 230 Operational Conversion Unit (OCU), the first in July 1956.Laming 2002, pp. 217\u2013219. Later aircraft, painted in anti-flash white and powered by the Olympus 102 with thrust, began to enter squadron service in July 1957.Wynn 1997, p. 145. The Olympus 102s were quickly modified to the Olympus 104 standard, ultimately rated at thrust.Baxter 1990, p. 46. As far back as 1952, Bristol Aero Engines had begun development of the BOl.6 (Olympus 6) rated at thrust16,000 lb Thrust Flight 15 February 1957 p 200 but if fitted to the B.1, this would have re-introduced the buffet requiring further redesign of the wing.Laming 2002, p. 62. The decision to proceed with the B.2 versions of the Vulcan was made in May 1956, being developed by Avro's chief designer Roy Ewans. It was anticipated that the first B.2 would be around the 45th aircraft of the 99 then on order.Wynn 1997, pp. 315, 316. As well as being able to achieve greater heights over targets, it was believed that operational flexibility could be extended by the provision of in-flight refuelling equipment and tanker aircraft.Wynn 1997, p. 154. The increasing sophistication of Soviet air defences required the fitting of electronic countermeasure (ECM) equipment and vulnerability could be reduced by the introduction of the Avro Blue Steel stand-off missile, then in development.Wynn 1997, p. 314. In order to develop these proposals, the second Vulcan prototype VX777 was rebuilt with the larger and thinner phase 2C wing, improved flying control surfaces and Olympus 102 engines, first flying in this configuration in August 1957.Laming 2002, p. 82. Plans were in hand to equip all Vulcans from the 16th aircraft onwards with in-flight refuelling receiving equipment.Wynn 1997, p. 155. A B.1, XA903, was allocated for Blue Steel development work. Other B.1s were used for the development of the BOl.6 (later Olympus 200), XA891; a new AC electrical system, XA893; and ECM including jammers within a bulged tail-cone and a tail warning radar, XA895.Laming 2002, pp. 218, 219. Avro Vulcan B.2 XH533, the first B.2 Vulcan, flying at Farnborough in 1958 The 46th production aircraft and first B.2, XH533, first flew in September 1958 fitted with Olympus 200 engines with thrust, six months before the last B.1 XH532 was delivered in March 1959.Laming 2002, p. 230. Rebuilding B.1s as B.2s was considered but rejected over cost. Nevertheless, to extend the B.1's service life, 28 were upgraded by Armstrong Whitworth between 1959 and 1963 to the B.1A standard, including features of the B.2 such as ECM equipment,Brookes and Davey, 2009, p. 12. in-flight refuelling receiving equipment,Pilot's Notes intro. Para. 1. and UHF radio.Pilot's Notes pt. 1, ch. 16, para. 5. The second B.2, XH534, flew in January 1959. Powered by production Olympus 201 with thrust, it was more representative of a production aircraft, being fitted with an in-flight refuelling probe and a bulged ECM tail cone. Some subsequent B.2s were initially lacking probes and ECM tail cones, but these were fitted retrospectively. The first 10 B.2s outwardly showed their B.1 ancestry, retaining narrow engine air intakes. Anticipating even more powerful engines, the air intakes were deepened on the 11th (XH557) and subsequent aircraft. Many of the early aircraft were retained for trials and it was the 12th B.2, XH558, that was the first to be delivered to the RAF in July 1960. Coincidentally, XH558 would also be the last Vulcan in service with the RAF, before being retired in 1992.Laming 2002, pp. 63, 64. The 26th B.2, XL317, the first of a production batch ordered in February 1956, was the first Vulcan, apart from development aircraft, capable of carrying the Blue Steel missile; 33 aircraft were delivered to the RAF with these modifications.Bulman 2001, p. 152. When the Mk.2 version of Blue Steel was cancelled in favour of the Douglas GAM-87 Skybolt air-launched ballistic missile in December 1959,Wynn 1997, p. 401. fittings were changed in anticipation of the new missile, one under each wing. Though Skybolt was cancelled in November 1962, many aircraft were delivered or retrofitted with \"Skybolt\" blisters.Bulman 2001, pp. 155\u2013161. Later aircraft (XL391 and XM574 onwards) were delivered with Olympus 301 engines with thrust. Two earlier aircraft were re-engined (XH557 and XJ784) for trials and development work; another seven aircraft (XL384\u2013XL390) were converted around 1963.Bulman 2001, pp. 149, 150. The last B.2 XM657 was delivered in 1965 and the type served till 1984. Whilst in service the B.2 was continuously updated with modifications including rapid engine starting, bomb- bay fuel tanks, wing strengthening to give the fatigue life to enable the aircraft to fly at low level (a tactic introduced in the mid-1960s), upgraded navigation equipment, terrain following radar (TFR), standardisation on a common nuclear weapon (WE.117) and improved ECM equipment.Brookes and Davey 2009, pp. 21\u201323. The B.1As were not strengthened, thus all were withdrawn by 1968.Laming 2002, pp. 217\u2013220. Nine B.2s were modified for a maritime radar reconnaissance (MRR) roleBrookes and Davey 2009, p. 83. and six for an airborne tanker role.Darling 2007, p. 122. An updated bomb rack assembly allowed the carriage of 30 1,000 lb bombs, up from 21https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOmPJOT-wUg and the updated wing profile increased range to 4,000 nm (7,400 km). ===Proposed developments and cancelled projects=== ;Avro Type 718: The Avro 718 was a 1951 proposal for a delta- winged military transport based on the Type 698 to carry 80 troops or 110 passengers. It would have been powered by four Bristol Olympus BOl.3 engines.\"Avro Type List.\" Avro Heritage. Retrieved: 4 August 2013. ;Avro Atlantic: The Avro Type 722 Atlantic was a 1952 proposal (announced in June 1953) for a 120-passenger delta-winged airliner based on the Type 698. ;Avro Type 732: The Avro 732 was a 1956 proposal for a supersonic development of the Vulcan and would have been powered by 8 de Havilland Gyron Junior engines. Unlike the proposed Avro 721 low-level bomber of 1952 or the Avro 730 supersonic stainless steel canard bomber dating from 1954 (cancelled in 1957 before completion of the prototype), the Type 732 showed its Vulcan heritage. ;Vulcan Phase 6 (Vulcan B.3) Silhouette of the original study for the Vulcan B.3 patrol missile carrier In 1960, the Air Staff approached Avro with a request into a study for a patrol missile carrier armed with up to six Skybolt missiles capable of a mission length of 12 hours. Avro's submission in May 1960 was the Phase 6 Vulcan, which if built would have been the Vulcan B.3. The aircraft was fitted with an enlarged wing of span with increased fuel capacity; additional fuel tanks in a dorsal spine; a new main undercarriage to carry an all-up-weight of ; and reheated Olympus 301s of thrust. An amended proposal of October 1960 inserted a plug into the forward fuselage with capacity for six crew members including a relief pilot, all facing forwards on ejection seats, and aft-fan versions of the Olympus 301.Gibson 2011, pp. 117\u2013118. ===Export proposals=== Other countries expressed interest in purchasing Vulcans but, as with the other V-bombers, no foreign sales materialised.\"Labour research, Volume 51.\" 1962, p. 20. ;Australia: As early as 1954, Australia recognised that the English Electric Canberra was becoming outdated and evaluated aircraft such as the Avro Vulcan and Handley-Page Victor as potential replacements.Stephens 1992, p. 142. Political pressure for a Canberra replacement rose to a head in 1962; at which point more modern types such as the BAC TSR-2, General Dynamics F-111C, and North American A-5 Vigilante had become available. The RAF would have transferred several V-bombers, including Vulcans, for interim use by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) if they had purchased the TSR-2, but the RAAF selected the F-111C.\"Correspondence between the Australian and British Governments concerning the selection of the F-111 over the TSR-2.\" National Archives of Australia. Retrieved: 11 November 2010.Wilson 1989, p. 146. ;Argentina: In the early 1980s, Argentina approached the UK with a proposal to buy a number of Vulcans. An application, made in September 1981, requested the 'early availability' of a 'suitable aircraft'. With some reluctance, British ministers approved the export of a single aircraft, but emphasised that clearance had not been given for the sale of a larger number. A letter from the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office to the Ministry of Defence in January 1982 stated that little prospect was seen of this happening without ascertaining the Argentine interest and whether such interest was genuine: 'On the face of it, a strike aircraft would be entirely suitable for an attack on the Falklands.'\"Falklands: FCO to MOD (sale of Vulcans to Argentina \u2013 no clearance given for sales \u2013 declassified 2012)\" Margaret Thatcher Foundation. Retrieved: 4 August 2013. Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands less than three months later, after which a British embargo on the sale of any military equipment was quickly imposed, ending the prospect of any sale. ==Design== Duxford Airshow 2012 Bomb bay ===Overview=== Despite its radical and unusual shape, the airframe was built along traditional lines. Except for the most highly stressed parts, the whole structure was manufactured from standard grades of light alloy. The airframe was broken down into a number of major assemblies: the centre section, a rectangular box containing the bomb-bay and engine bays bounded by the front and rear spars and the wing transport joints; the intakes and centre fuselage; the front fuselage, incorporating the pressure cabin; the nose; the outer wings; the leading edges; the wing trailing edge and tail end of the fuselage; the wings were not sealed and used directly as fuel tankage, but carried bladders for fuel in the void spaces of the wings; and there was a single swept tail fin with a single rudder on the trailing edge.Gunston, W. T. \"Building the Vulcan.\" Flight, 13 December 1957, p. 926. A five-man crew, the first pilot, co-pilot, navigator radar, navigator plotter and air electronics officer (AEO) was accommodated within the pressure cabin on two levels; the pilots sitting on Martin-Baker 3K (3KS on the B.2) ejection seats whilst on the lower level, the other crew sat facing rearwards and would abandon the aircraft via the entrance door.Pilot's Notes pt. 1, leading particulars.Aircrew Manual pt. 1, ch. 2, para. 2. The original B35/46 specification sought a jettisonable crew compartment, this requirement was removed in a subsequent amendment, the rear crew's escape system was often an issue of controversy, such as when a practical refit scheme was rejected.Wynn 1997, p. 50.Laming 2002, p. 64. A rudimentary sixth seat forward of the navigator radar was provided for an additional crew member;Pilot's Notes pt. 1, introduction, para 2. the B.2 had an additional seventh seat opposite the sixth seat and forward of the AEO. These seats were no more than cushions, a full harness and an oxygen and intercom facility. The visual bomb-aimer's compartment could be fitted with a T4 (Blue Devil) bombsight,Price, Blackman and Edmonson 2010, p. 102. in many B.2s this space housed a vertically mounted Vinten F95 Mk.10 camera for assessing simulated low-level bombing runs.Brookes and Davey 2009, p. 65. Fuel was carried in 14 bag tanks, four in the centre fuselage above and to the rear of the nosewheel bay and five in each outer wing. The tanks were split into four groups of almost equal capacity, each normally feeding its respective engine though cross-feeding was possible. The centre of gravity was automatically maintained by electric timers which sequenced the booster pumps on the tanks.Aircrew Manual pt. 1, ch. 8, paras. 1, 2, 48. B.2 aircraft could be fitted with one or two additional fuel tanks in the bomb-bay.Aircrew Manual pt. 1, ch. 8, paras. 3, 12. Despite being designed before a low radar cross-section (RCS) and other stealth factors were ever a consideration, a Royal Aircraft Establishment technical note of 1957 stated that of all the aircraft so far studied, the Vulcan appeared by far the simplest radar echoing object, due to its shape: only one or two components contributed significantly to the echo at any aspect, compared with three or more on most other types.Dawson 1957, p. 3. ===Colour schemes=== Aerial view of a Vulcan B.2 in late RAF markings on static display at RAF Mildenhall, 1984 The two prototype Vulcans were finished in gloss white. Early Vulcan B.1s left the factory in a natural metal finish; the front half of the nose radome was painted black, the rear half painted silver. Front-line Vulcan B.1s had a finish of anti-flash white and RAF \"type D\" roundels. Front-line Vulcan B.1As and B.2s were similar but with 'type D pale' roundels.Brookes and Davey 2009, pp. 33\u201335. With the adoption of low-level attack profiles in the mid-1960s, B.1As and B.2s were given a glossy sea grey medium and dark green disruptive pattern camouflage on the upper surfaces, white undersurfaces and \"type D\" roundels. (The last 13 Vulcan B.2s, XM645 onwards, were delivered thus from the factoryBulman 2001, p. 43.). In the mid-1970s: Vulcan B.2s received a similar scheme with matte camouflage, light aircraft grey undersides, and \"low-visibility\" roundels; B.2(MRR)s received a similar scheme in gloss; and the front half of the radomes were no longer painted black. Beginning in 1979, 10 Vulcans received a wrap-around camouflage of dark sea grey and dark greenBrookes and Davey 2009, pp. 36\u201341.Bulman 2001, p. 170. because, during Red Flag exercises in the US, defending SAM forces had found that the grey- painted undersides of the Vulcan became much more visible against the ground at high angles of bank. Avro Vulcan Flight Deck ===Avionics=== The original Vulcan B.1 radio fit was: two 10-channel VHF transmitter/receivers (TR-1985/TR-1986) and a 24-channel HF transmitter-receiver (STR-18).Wynn 1997, p. 137. The Vulcan B.1A also featured a UHF transmitter-receiver (ARC-52). The initial B.2 radio fit was similar to the B.1APrice, Blackman and Edmonson 2010, p. 112. though it was ultimately fitted with the ARC-52, a V/UHF transmitter/receiver (PTR-175), and a single-sideband modulation HF transmitter-receiver (Collins 618T).Aircrew Manual pt. 1, ch. 14, paras. 1\u201312. The navigation and bombing system (NBS) comprised an H2S Mk9 radar and a navigation bombing computer (NBC) Mk1. Other navigation aids included a Marconi radio compass (ADF), GEE Mk3, Green Satin Doppler radar to determine the groundspeed and drift angle, radio and radar altimeters, and an instrument landing system. TACAN replaced GEE in the B.1APilot's Notes pt. 1, ch. 16, para. 11. and B.2 in 1964 . Decca Doppler 72 replaced Green Satin in the B.2 around 1969Price, Blackman and Edmonson 2010, pp. 102, 103. A continuous display of the aircraft's position was maintained by a ground position indicator (GPI). Vulcan B.2s were eventually fitted with the twin-gyro free- running gyroscopic heading reference system (HRS) Mk.2, based upon the inertial platform of the Blue Steel missile, which had been integrated into the system when the missile had been carried. With the HRS a navigator's heading unit (NHU) was provided which enabled the navigator plotter to adjust the aircraft heading, through the autopilot, by as little as 0.1 degrees. The B.2 (MRR) was additionally fitted with the LORAN C navigation system. The original ECM fit as fitted to the B.1A and B.2 was: one Green Palm voice communications' jammer; two Blue Diver metric jammers; three Red Shrimp S-band jammers; a Blue Saga passive warning receiver with four aerials (PWR); a Red Steer tail warning radar; and window (chaff) dispensers.Wynn 1997, p. 321. The bulk of the equipment was carried in a large extended tail cone, and a flat ECM aerial counterpoise plate mounted between the starboard tailpipes.Wynn 1997, p. 151. Later equipment on the B.2 included: an L band jammer (replacing a Red Shrimp); the ARI 18146 X-band jammer;Price, Blackman and Edmonson 2010, p. 106. replacing the Green Palm; the improved Red Steer Mk.2; infra-red decoys (flares); and the ARI 18228 PWR with its aerials that gave a squared top to the fin.Brookes and Davey 2009, p. 57. ===Controls=== Vulcan B.1 XA890 in early silver scheme landing at Farnborough in September 1955 after Roly Falk's \"aerobatic\" display. Note the lower outer starboard airbrake, which was later deleted. The aircraft was controlled by a fighter-type control stick and rudder bar which operated the powered flying controls (PFCs). Each PFC had a single electro-hydraulic powered flying control unit (PFCU) except the rudder which had two, one running as a back-up. Artificial feel and autostabilisation in the form of pitch and yaw dampers were provided, as well as an auto mach trimmer.Aircrew Manual pt. 1, ch. 7, paras. 1, 7, 10, 24, 48. The flight instruments in the B.1 were traditional and included G4B compasses;Pilot's Notes pt.1, ch. 16, para. 1 Mk.4 artificial horizons;Pilot's Notes pt.1, ch. 20, para. 3b and zero reader flight display instruments.Pilot's Notes pt.1, ch. 16, para. 3b The B.1 had a Smiths Mk10 autopilot.Pilot's Notes pt. 1, ch. 10. In the B.2, these features were incorporated into the Smiths Military Flight System (MFS), the pilots' components being: two beam compasses; two director-horizons; and a Mk.10A or Mk.10B autopilot.Aircrew Manual pt.1, ch. 12, para. 1. From 1966, B.2s were fitted with the ARI 5959 Terrain-following radar (TFR), built by General Dynamics,\"National Archive file AVIA 2347.\" National Archives. Retrieved: 11 September 2012. its commands being fed into the director-horizons.Aircrew Manual pt. 1, ch. 15, p. 5. The B.1 had four elevators (inboard) and four ailerons (outboard).Pilot's Notes pt. 1, ch. 10, para. 1(a). In the B.2, these were replaced by eight elevons.Aircrew Manual pt. 1, ch. 7, para. 7. The Vulcan was also fitted with six electrically operated three-position (retracted, medium drag, high drag) airbrakes, four in the upper centre section and two in the lower.Aircrew Manual pt. 1, ch. 7, para 70. There were originally four lower airbrakes but the outboard two were deleted before the aircraft entered service.Darling 1999, p. 19. A brake parachute was installed inside the tail cone.Aircrew Manual pt. 1, ch. 7, para. 77. ===Electrical and hydraulic systems=== The main electrical system on the B.1/B.1A was 112 V DC supplied by four 22.5kW engine-driven starter- generators. Backup power was provided by four 24 V 40 Ah batteries connected in series providing 96 V. Secondary electrical systems were 28 V DC, single- phase 115 V AC at 1600 Hz, and three-phase 115 V AC at 400 Hz, driven by transformers and inverters from the main system. The 28 V DC system was backed up by a single 24 V battery.Pilot's Notes, ch. 7. For greater efficiency and higher reliability,Blackman 2007, pp. 100, 101. the main system on the B.2 was changed to three-phase 200 V AC at 400 Hz supplied by four 40 kVA engine- driven constant speed alternators. Engine starting was then by air-starters supplied from a Palouste compressor on the ground. Standby supplies in the event of a main AC failure were provided by a ram air turbine (RAT) driving a 17 kVA alternator that could operate from high altitudes down to , and an airborne auxiliary power plant (AAPP), a Rover gas turbine driving a 40kVA alternator, which could be started once the aircraft was below an altitude of . Secondary electrical supplies were by transformer-rectifier units (TRUs) for 28 V DC and rotary frequency converters for the 115 V 1600 Hz single phase supplies.Aircrew Manual, ch. 4. The change to an AC system was a significant improvement. The Vulcan's powered flying controls were hydraulically actuated but each powered flying control unit (PFCU) had a hydraulic pump which was driven by an electric motor.Aircrew Manual, ch. 7. Because there was no manual reversion, a total electrical failure would result in a loss of control. The standby batteries on the B.1 were designed to give enough power for 20 minutes of flying time but this proved to be optimistic and two aircraft, XA891 and XA908, crashed as a result. The main hydraulic system provided pressure for undercarriage raising and lowering and bogie trim; nosewheel centring and steering; wheelbrakes (fitted with Maxarets); bomb doors opening and closing; and (B.2 only) AAPP air scoop lowering. Hydraulic pressure was provided by three hydraulic pumps fitted to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines. An electrically operated hydraulic power pack (EHPP) could be used to operate the bomb doors and recharge the brake accumulators. A compressed air (later nitrogen) system was provided for emergency undercarriage lowering.Aircrew Manual pt. 1, ch. 10, paras. 1\u20133, 48. ===Engine=== The Rolls-Royce Olympus, originally known as the \"Bristol BE.10 Olympus\",Baxter 1990, p. 18. is a two-spool axial-flow turbojet that powered the Vulcan. Each Vulcan had four engines buried in the wings, positioned in pairs close to the fuselage. The engine's design began in 1947, intended to power the Bristol Aeroplane Company's own rival design to the Vulcan.Baxter 1990, p. 13. A serendipitous arrangement in air intakes could cause the Vulcan to emit a distinctive \"howl\" when the engines were at approximately 90% power,\"We all love the howl\" Vulcan To The Sky Trust, 13 December 2013. which can be heard as the aircraft performs a flypast, such as at public airshows.\"Will 'howl' of the Vulcan bomber be heard over Bournemouth again?\" The Daily Echo, 30 December 2009.\"Vulcan XH558 Awesome Howl Sounds\" YouTube, 28 October 2012. Gas-flow diagram of an Olympus Mk 101 engine As the prototype Vulcan VX770 was ready for flight prior to the Olympus being available, it first flew using Rolls-Royce Avon RA.3 engines of thrust. These were quickly replaced by Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire ASSa.6 engines of thrust.Laming 2002, pp. 45, 46. VX770 later became a flying test bed for the Rolls-Royce Conway.Laming 2002, p. 108. The second prototype VX777 first flew with Olympus hundreds of thrust. It was subsequently re-engined with Olympus 101 engines of thrust.Laming 2002, p. 47. When VX777 flew with a Phase 2C (B.2) wing in 1957, it was fitted with Olympus 102 engines of thrust.Laming 2002, p. 63. Early B.1s were engined with the Olympus 101. Later aircraft were delivered with Olympus 102s. All Olympus 102s became the Olympus 104 of thrust on overhaul and ultimately thrust on uprating.Baxter 1990, pp. 44\u201346. The first B.2 flew with the second-generation Olympus 200 of thrust,Baxter 1990, p. 50. design of which began in 1952.\"16,000 lb Thrust.\" Flight, 15 February 1957, p. 200. Subsequent B.2s were engined with either the uprated Olympus 201 of thrust or the Olympus 301 of thrust. The Olympus 201 was designated 202 on being fitted with a rapid air starter.Baxter 1990, pp. 50\u201364. The engine would later be developed into a reheated (afterburning) powerplant for the cancelled supersonic BAC TSR-2 strike bomber and the supersonic passenger transport Concorde.Buttler 2007, p. 72. ==Operational history== ===Introduction=== In September 1956, the RAF received its first Vulcan B.1, XA897, which immediately embarked upon a round-the-world tour. The tour was to be an important demonstration of the range and capabilities of the aircraft, but it also had other benefits in the form of conducting goodwill visits in various countries; in later life Vulcans routinely visited various nations and distant parts of the former British Empire as a show of support and military protection.Lambert, C. M. \"Bomex By Vulcan.\" Flight International, January 1958, p. 66. This first tour, however, was struck by misfortune; on 1 October 1956, while landing in bad weather at London Heathrow Airport at the completion of the world tour, XA897 was destroyed in a fatal accident. A Vulcan B1A of the Waddington Wing at Filton during a public air display in the 1960s The first two aircraft were delivered to 230 OCU in January 1957 and the training of crews started on 21 February 1957; in the following months more aircraft were delivered to the OCU.Laming 2002, p. 60. The first OCU course to qualify was No. 1 Course, on 21 May 1957, and they went on to form the first flight of No. 83 Squadron. No. 83 Squadron was the first operational squadron to use the bomber, at first using borrowed Vulcans from the OCU, and on 11 July 1956 it received the first aircraft of its own. By September 1957, several Vulcans had been handed over to No. 83 Squadron.\"Vulcans In Service: A visit to the V-force Delta of No.1 Group in Lincolnshire.\" Flight International, 27 September 1957, pp. 502\u2013503. The second OCU course also formed a Flight of 83 Squadron, but subsequent trained crews were also used to form the second bomber squadron, 101 Squadron. The last aircraft from the first batch of 25 aircraft had been delivered by the end of 1957 to 101 Squadron. In order to increase the mission range and flight time for Vulcan operations, in-flight refuelling capabilities were added in 1959 onwards; several Valiant bombers were refurbished as tankers to refuel the Vulcans.Brookes and Davey 2009, p. 49. Continuous airborne patrols proved untenable, however, and the refuelling mechanisms across the Vulcan fleet fell into disuse in the 1960s. Both Vulcans and the other V-force aircraft routinely visited the Far East, in particular Singapore, where a fully equipped nuclear weapons storage facility had been constructed in 1959.Darling 2007, p. 55. During the Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation Britain planned to deploy three squadrons of V-bomber aircraft and 48 Red Beard tactical nuclear weapons to the region; although this was ultimately decided against, Vulcans trained in the region for both conventional and nuclear missions. Britain regularly deployed Vulcans to the Far East as a part of their contribution to SEATO operations, often to test the defenses of friendly nations in joint exercises. In the early 1970s, the RAF decided to permanently deploy two squadrons of Vulcans overseas in the Near East Air Force Bomber Wing, based at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus; the Vulcans were withdrawn as Cypriot intercommunal violence intensified in the mid-1970s.Darling 2007, pp. 65, 108. Royal Air Force Vulcan B.2 being prepared for flight on 25 May 1985 Vulcans flew some very long range missions. In June 1961, one of them took off from RAF Scampton to Sydney, with an 18,507 km long journey, flown in only a bit more than 20 hours and three air refuellings. Vulcans frequently visited the United States during the 1960s and 1970s to participate in air shows and static displays, as well as to participate in the Strategic Air Command's Annual Bombing and Navigation Competition at such locations as Barksdale AFB, Louisiana and the former McCoy AFB, Florida, with the RAF crews representing Bomber Command and later Strike Command. Vulcans also took part in the 1960, 1961, and 1962 Operation Skyshield exercises, in which NORAD defences were tested against possible Soviet air attack, the Vulcans simulating Soviet fighter/bomber attacks against New York, Chicago and Washington. The results of the tests were classified until 1997.Mola, Roger A. \"The Day Nobody Flew.\" airspacemag.com, November 2006. Retrieved: 5 November 2009. The Vulcan proved quite successful during the 1974 \"Giant Voice\" exercise, in which it managed to avoid USAF interceptors.Sgarlato, Nico. \"Avro Vulcan.\" Aerei magazine, Delta Editions, Parma, November 1996, p. 56. ===Nuclear deterrent=== As part of Britain's independent nuclear deterrent, the Vulcan initially carried Britain's first nuclear weapon, the Blue Danube gravity bomb.Darling 2007, p. 6. Blue Danube was a low-kiloton yield fission bomb designed before the United States detonated the first hydrogen bomb. These were supplemented by U.S.-owned Mk 5 bombs (made available under the Project E programme) and later by the British Red Beard tactical nuclear weapon.Leitch Air Enthusiast September/October 2003, pp. 55, 58. The UK had previously embarked on its own hydrogen bomb programme, and to bridge the gap until these were ready the V-bombers were equipped with an Interim Megaton Weapon based on the Blue Danube casing containing Green Grass, a large pure-fission warhead of yield.Darling 2007, p. 32. This bomb was known as Violet Club. Only five were deployed before the Green Grass warhead was incorporated into a developed weapon as Yellow Sun Mk.1. The later Yellow Sun Mk 2, was fitted with Red Snow, a British-built variant of the U.S. W28 warhead. Yellow Sun Mk 2 was the first British thermonuclear weapon to be deployed, and was carried on both the Vulcan and Handley Page Victor. The Valiant retained U.S. nuclear weapons assigned to SACEUR under the dual-key arrangements. Red Beard was pre- positioned in Singapore for use by Vulcan and Victor bombers.Darling 2007, p. 19. From 1962, three squadrons of Vulcan B.2s and two squadrons of Victor B.2s were armed with the Blue Steel missile, a rocket-powered stand-off bomb, which was also fitted with the yield Red Snow warhead.Darling 2007, p. 76. Operationally, RAF Bomber Command and the U.S. Strategic Air Command cooperated in the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP) to ensure coverage of all major Soviet targets from 1958, 108 aircraft of the RAF's V-Bombers were assigned targets under SIOP by the end of 1959.Brookes and Davey 2009, p. 14. From 1962 onwards, two jets in every major RAF base were armed with nuclear weapons and on standby permanently under the principle of Quick Reaction Alert (QRA). Vulcans on QRA standby were to be airborne within four minutes of receiving an alert, as this was identified as the amount of time between warning of a USSR nuclear strike being launched and it arriving in Britain.Brookes and Davey 2009, p. 43. The closest the Vulcan came to taking part in potential nuclear conflict was during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, where Bomber Command was moved to Alert Condition 3, an increased state of preparedness from normal operations; however, it stood down in early November.Brookes and Davey 2009, pp. 14\u201315. XH558 taking off, 2008 Farnborough Airshow The Vulcans were intended to be equipped with the American Skybolt Air Launched Ballistic Missile to replace the Blue Steel, with Vulcan B.2s carrying two Skybolts under the wings; the last 28 B.2s were modified on the production line to fit pylons to carry the Skybolt.Laming 2002, p. 88.Darling 2007, p. 116. A B.3 variant with increased wingspan to carry up to six Skybolts was proposed in 1960.Laming 2002, p. 89. When the Skybolt missile system was cancelled by U.S. President John F. Kennedy on the recommendation of his Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara in 1962, precipitating the Skybolt Crisis, Blue Steel was retained. To supplement it until the Royal Navy took on the deterrent role with Polaris ICBM-equipped submarines, the Vulcan bombers adopted a new mission profile of flying high during clear transit, dropping down low to avoid enemy defences on approach, and deploying a parachute-retarded bomb, the WE.177B. However, since the aircraft had been designed for high-altitude flight, at low altitudes it could not exceed 350 knots. RAF Air Vice Marshal Ron Dick, a former Vulcan pilot, said \"it is [thus] questionable whether it could have been effective flying at low level in a war against ... the Soviet Union.\" After the British Polaris submarines became operational and Blue Steel was taken out of service in 1970, the Vulcan continued to carry WE.177B in a tactical nuclear strike role as part of the British contribution to Europe's standing NATO forces, although they no longer held aircraft at 15 minutes' readiness in peacetime.Darling 2007, p. 65. Two squadrons were also stationed in Cyprus as part of the Near East Air Force and assigned to Central Treaty Organization in a strategic strike role. With the eventual demise of the WE.177B and the Vulcan bombers, the Blackburn Buccaneer, SEPECAT Jaguar, and Panavia Tornado continued with the WE.177C until its retirement in 1998.\"Royal Air Force loses nuclear arsenal.\" AP Online, 31 March 1998. While not a like-for-like replacement, the multi-role Tornado interdictor/strike bomber is the successor for the roles previously filled by the Vulcan.Segell 1997, p. 124. ===Conventional role=== Vulcan XM597 at the National Museum of Flight, Scotland; note the Operation Black Buck markings and the small Brazilian flag indicating the aircraft's internment in Brazil. Engineers and flight crew with the Vulcan prior to deployment in the Falklands Although in operational use the Vulcan typically carried various nuclear armaments, the type also had a secondary conventional role. While performing conventional combat missions, the Vulcan could carry up to 21 bombs inside its bomb bay.Bull 2004, p. 84. From the 1960s, the various Vulcan squadrons would routinely conduct conventional training missions; the aircrews were expected to be able to perform conventional bombing missions, in addition to the critical nuclear strike mission.Darling 2007, p. 63. The Vulcan's only combat missions took place towards the end of the type's service in 1982. During the Falklands War, the Vulcan was deployed against Argentinian forces which had occupied the Falkland Islands. The missions performed by the Vulcan became known as the Black Buck raids, each aircraft had to fly from Ascension Island to reach Stanley on the Falklands. Victor tankers conducted the necessary air-to-air refuelling for the Vulcan to cover the distance involved; approximately of fuel was used in each mission.\"The Falkland Islands: A history of the 1982 conflict.\" Royal Air Force, 29 April 2010. Five Vulcans were selected to participate in the operation. In order to do so, each aircraft had to receive various last-minute adaptations; including modifications to the bomb bay, the reinstatement of the long out-of-use in- flight refuelling system, the installation of a new navigational system derived from the Vickers VC10, and the updating of several onboard electronics. Underneath the wings, new pylons were fitted to carry an ECM pod and Shrike anti-radar missiles at wing hardpoint locations; these hardpoints had originally been installed for the purpose of carrying the cancelled Skybolt nuclear missile. Engineering work to retrofit these Vulcans had begun on 9 April.Darling 2007, pp. 116\u2013117.Braybook 1982, p. 17. A Vulcan flying over Ascension Island on 18 May 1982 On 1 May, the first mission was conducted by a single Vulcan (XM607) that flew over Port Stanley and dropped its bombs on the airfield concentrating on the single runway, with one direct hit, making it unsuitable for fighter aircraft. The Vulcan's mission was quickly followed up by strikes against anti-air installations, flown by British Aerospace Sea Harriers from nearby Royal Navy carriers.Hearn 2007, p. 268. Three Vulcan missions were flown against the airfield, a further two missions in which missiles were launched against radar installations; an additional two missions were cancelled. At the time, these missions held the record for the world's longest-distance raids.White 2006 The ECM systems on board the Vulcans proved to be effective at jamming Argentine radars; while a Vulcan was within the theatre, other British aircraft in the vicinity had a greatly reduced chance of coming under effective fire.Darling 2007, p. 118. On 3 June 1982, Vulcan B.2 XM597 of No. 50 Squadron took part in the \"Black Buck 6\" mission against Argentinian radar sites at Stanley airfield on the Falkland Islands. While attempting to refuel for its return journey to Ascension Island, the probe broke, leaving the Vulcan with insufficient fuel, forcing a diversion to Gale\u00e3o Air Force Base, Rio de Janeiro in neutral Brazil. En route, secret papers were dumped along with the two remaining AGM-45 Shrike missiles, although one failed to launch. After a mayday call, the Vulcan, escorted by Brazilian Air Force Northrop F-5 fighters, was permitted an emergency landing at Rio with very little fuel left on board.Kev Darling, RAR Illustrated: Avro Vulcan Part 1, Big Bird Publications 2007, (p.119) The Vulcan and her crew were detained until the end of hostilities nine days later.Chris Chant, Air War in the Falklands 1982, Osprey Publishing Limited 2001, (p.92) ===Reconnaissance=== In November 1973, as a result of the planned closure of the Victor SR.2 equipped No. 543 Squadron, No. 27 Squadron reformed at RAF Scampton equipped with the Vulcan as a replacement in the maritime radar reconnaissance role.Jones V-Bombers 2007, pp. 158\u2013159. The squadron carried out patrols of the seas around the British Isles, including the strategically important GIUK gap between Iceland and the United Kingdom, flying at high level and using the Vulcan's H2S radar to monitor shipping. In peacetime, this could be followed up by visual identification and photography of targets of interest at low level. In the event of war, a Vulcan would leave visual identification of potential targets to Buccaneers or Canberras, and could coordinate attacks by Buccaneers against hostile shipping.Jackson Wings of Fame 1996, pp. 67, 78. Though initially equipped with a number of B.2 aircraft,Bulman 2001, p. 87. the Squadron eventually operated nine B.2 (MRR) aircraft (also known by the unofficial designation SR.2). The aircraft were modified for the role by removing the Terrain Following Radar (and its thimble radome) and adding the LORAN C radio navigation aid. The main external visual difference was the presence of a gloss paint finish, with a light grey undersurface, to protect against sea spray. The squadron also inherited its secondary role of air sampling from No. 543 Squadron. This involved flying through plumes of airborne contamination and using onboard equipment to collect fallout released from both above ground and underground nuclear tests for later analysis at the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston.Brookes 2011, p. 70. Five aircraft had small pylons fitted to the redundant Skybolt hardpoints, which could be used to carry sampling pods modified from drop tanks. These pods would collect the needed samples on a filter, while an additional smaller \"localiser\" pod was fitted to the port wing, inboard of the main pylons.Bulman 2001, p. 90. The squadron disbanded at Scampton in March 1982, passing on its radar reconnaissance duties to the RAF's Nimrods.Jones V-Bombers 2007, p. 159. ===Aerial refuelling role=== After the end of the Falklands War in 1982, the Vulcan B.2 was due to be withdrawn from RAF service that year.Polmar and Bell 2004, p. 261. However, the Falklands campaign had consumed much of the airframe fatigue life of the RAF's Victor tankers. While Vickers VC10 tanker conversions had been ordered in 1979\"Defence.\" Flight International, 14 April 1979, p. 1136. and Lockheed TriStar tankers would be ordered after the conflict,Frawley 2002, p. 44. as a stopgap measure six Vulcans were converted into single point tankers. The Vulcan tanker conversion was accomplished by removing the jammers from the ECM bay in the tail of the aircraft, and replacing them with a single Hose Drum Unit. An additional cylindrical bomb-bay tank was fitted, making a total of three, giving a fuel capacity of almost .Halpenny 2006, p. 244. The go-ahead for converting the six aircraft was given on 4 May 1982.Halpenny 2006, p. 243. Just 50 days after being ordered, the first Vulcan tanker, XH561, was delivered to RAF Waddington. The Vulcan K.2s were operated by No. 50 Squadron, along with three Vulcan B.2s, in support of UK air defence activities until it was disbanded in March 1984.Darling 2007, p. 124. ===Vulcan Display Flight=== Vulcan B.2 in formation with the Red Arrows, 2015 After the disbandment of No. 50 Squadron, two Vulcans continued flying with the RAF in air displays as part of the Vulcan Display Flight, based at Waddington but administered through No. 55 Squadron, based at RAF Marham. Initially displaying using XL426, in 1986 that aircraft was sold, having been replaced by XH558, which began displays in 1985. The VDF continued with XH558 until 1992, finishing operations after the Ministry of Defence determined it was too costly to run in light of budget cuts. Both aircraft subsequently entered preservation and survived, although a third, XH560, kept in reserve in the first years, was later scrapped. ===Engine test beds=== * The first prototype VX770 had its Sapphire engines replaced with four Rolls-Royce Conway RCo.7 turbofans in 1957. It was transferred to Rolls-Royce as the Conway test bed.Jackson 1990, pp. 409\u2013411. It flew with the Conways, the first turbofans in the world, until its fatal crash in September 1958.Jackson 1990, p. 411. * The first Vulcan B.1 XA889 was used for the flight clearances of the Olympus 102 and 104.Baxter 1989, p. 44. * Vulcan B.1 XA891 was fitted with four Olympus 200 engines in the spring of 1958 for intensive flying trials. The aircraft crashed in July 1958 during a routine test flight.Baxter 1989, p. 50. * Vulcan B.1 XA894 flew with five Olympus engines, the standard four Mk.101s, plus a reheated Olympus 320 destined for the BAC TSR-2 in an underslung nacelle. This aircraft was destroyed in a ground fire at Filton on 3 December 1962. * Vulcan B.1 XA896 was withdrawn from RAF service in June 1964 and transferred to be converted to the test bed for the Bristol Siddeley BS100 vectored thrust turbofan for the Hawker Siddeley P.1154. The P.1154 was cancelled in February 1965 and XA896 was scrapped before being converted.Brookes and Davey 2009, p. 15. * Vulcan B.1 XA902 was withdrawn from RAF service after a landing accident in 1958. After rebuilding, it replaced VX770 as the Conway test bed, fitted with four RCo.11s. The two inner Conways were replaced with Rolls-Royce Speys, flying for the first time in this configuration on 12 October 1961. * Vulcan B.1 XA903, surplus to Blue Steel trials, was converted to a similar layout to XA894 to flight test the Olympus 593 Concorde installation. The first flight was on 1 October 1966 and testing continued through to June 1971.Austin 2009, pp. 111\u2013113. In April 1973, XA903 started flying with an underslung Rolls- Royce RB.199 turbofan destined for the Panavia Tornado. XA903 was the last B.1 to fly, being retired in February 1979.Austin 2009, p. 113. * Vulcan B.2 XH557 was used by BSEL for developing the Olympus 301 and first flew with the larger engine in May 1961. It was returned to Woodford in 1964 to be refurbished for the RAF.Baxter 1989, pp. 60, 64. ==Variants== ;B.1 :The initial production aircraft. First few with straight leading edge, later retrofitted with Phase 2 (kinked) wing. Early examples finished in silver, later changed to \"anti- flash\" white.

In the early 1960s the RAF ordered 20 Beagle Basset communication aircraft to move the crews to dispersal airfields; the importance of these aircraft was only brief, diminishing when the primary nuclear deterrent switched to the Royal Navy's Polaris Missile.\"Treasury and the Basset\". Flight International, 14 November 1968, p. 805. ==Accidents and incidents== * On 1 October 1956, Vulcan B.1 XA897, the first to be delivered, crashed at London Heathrow Airport during Operation Tasman Flight, a flag-waving trip to Australia and New Zealand. After a ground-controlled approach in bad weather, it struck the ground short of the runway just as engine power was applied.Blackman 2007, p. 142. The impact probably broke the drag links on the main undercarriage, allowing the undercarriage to be forced backwards and damaged the wing's trailing edge. After the initial impact, XA897 rose back in the air. The pilot, Squadron Leader D. R. Howard, and co-pilot Air Marshal Sir Harry Broadhurst, AOC-in-C Bomber Command, both ejected and survived, the other four occupants (including a spare pilot and an Avro representative) were killed when the aircraft hit the ground again and broke up.Gallop 2005, pp. 114\u2013115.\"Catalogue Ref. AIR 20/12396.\" National Archives, 1956. * In 1957, a Vulcan B.1 XA892 attached to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE;) at Boscombe Down for acceptance testing was unintentionally flown to an Indicated Mach Number (IMN) above 1.04, alarming the crew that it had reached supersonic speed. XA892's commander, Flt Lt Milt Cottee (RAAF), and co-pilot, Flt Lt Ray Bray (RAF), were tasked to fly at and 0.98 IMN, taking the aircraft to a load factor of 3 g. It climbed to and then dived, intending to reach the target speed at . Approaching the target altitude, the throttles were closed and full up-elevator applied, but XA892 continued to pitch nose-down. Cottee contemplated pushing forward to go inverted and then rolling upright; instead, he opened the speed brakes. Although the airspeed was above their maximum operating speed, the speed brakes were undamaged and did slow the aircraft, which came back past the vertical at about and leveled off at . There were no reports of a sonic boom, it is unlikely a true Mach Number of 1.0 was reached. Afterwards, a rear bulkhead was found to be deformed.Blackman 2007, p. 90. The prototype Vulcan VX770 in 1954, retaining the original \"pure delta\" wing shape * On 20 September 1958, prototype Vulcan VX770 was flown by a Rolls-Royce test pilot on an engine performance sortie with a fly past at RAF Syerston Battle of Britain At Home display. It flew along the main runway then started a roll to starboard and climbed slightly, during which the starboard wing disintegrated and the main spar collapsed. VX770 went into a dive with the starboard wing on fire and struck the ground, killing three occupants of a controllers' caravan and all four crew on board. Proposed causes of the structural failure have included pilot error, metal fatigue due to air intake vibration, and inadequate maintenance.\"Extract from National Archives: Ref no. BT 233/403 report on crash.\" National Archives, Retrieved: 24 August 2010.\"Anniversary of Vulcan crash.\" BBC News, 19 September 2008. * On 24 October 1958, Vulcan B.1 XA908 of No. 83 Squadron crashed east of Detroit, Michigan, USA. A complete electrical failure occurred at around . The backup system should have provided 20 minutes of emergency power, allowing XA908 to reach one of several airports in the area, but backup power lasted only three minutes due to a short circuit in the service busbar, locking the controls. Bound for Lincoln AFB in Nebraska, XA908 went into a steep dive before crashing, leaving a crater in the ground, which was later excavated while retrieving wreckage. Despite extensive property damage, there were no ground fatalities, only one person on the ground was hospitalized. All six crew members were killed, including the co-pilot, who had ejected. The co-pilot's ejection seat was found in Lake St Clair, but his body was not recovered until the following spring.Blackman 2007, p. 161. They were buried at Oak Ridge Cemetery in Trenton, Michigan, alongside 11 RAF student pilots killed during the Second World War in accidents at nearby Naval Air Station Grosse Ile.Bak, Richard. \"Mayday! Fifty years ago, a British bomber crashed into an east-side Detroit neighbourhood.\" Hour Detroit, July 2008. * On 24 July 1959, Vulcan B.1 XA891 crashed due to an electrical failure during an engine test. Shortly after take-off, the crew observed generator warning lights and loss of busbar voltage. The aircraft commander, Avro Chief Test Pilot Jimmy Harrison,Blackman 2007, p. 112. climbed XA891 to , steering away from the airfield and populated areas while the AEO attempted to solve the problem. When it became clear that control would not be regained, Harrison instructed the rear compartment crew to exit the aircraft and the co-pilot to eject, before ejecting himself. All the crew survived, making them the first complete Vulcan crew to successfully escape. The aircraft crashed near Kingston upon Hull. * On 26 October 1959, Vulcan B.1 XH498 participated in an airshow marking the opening of Wellington International Airport, formerly Rongotai Airport. After a ' touch-and-go landing' on Runway 34, it came around for a full stop landing. Turbulence and wind shear caused XH498 to land short of the runway threshold. The port undercarriage leg clipped the embankment at the Moa Point or southern end, damaging wing attachments, engine fuel lines and the main landing gear drag link, which was ruptured and unable to support the aircraft. The port wing tip nearly scraped the runway surface before it was able to lift off again, spilling fuel over the crowd. Pilot actions prevented a possible disaster as spectators were present on the western apron. XH498 flew to RNZAF Ohakea for a safe emergency landing on just the nose and starboard landing gear with little further damage. A UK repair team returned it to airworthiness; on 4 January 1960, XH498 departed, remaining in service until 19 October 1967. * On 16 September 1960, Vulcan B.2 XH557 damaged the \"Runway Garage\" at Filton. XH557 had been allocated to Bristol Siddeley Engines to test the Olympus 301 engine and was being delivered to Filton. Approaching in poor weather conditions, the aircraft touched down halfway along the runway. The braking parachute was streamed but realising the aircraft would not stop in time, the captain opened the throttles to go round. The Runway Garage took the full force of the jet blast and property damage was sustained: four petrol pumps were blown flat, a street light on the A38 was knocked down, railings were blown over, and multiple cars had their windscreens shattered. The aircraft diverted to St. Mawgan, flying into Filton days later.Baxter 1992, p. 60. * On 12 June 1963, Vulcan B.1A XH477 of No. 50 Squadron crashed in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. During a low-level exercise, the Vulcan was flown into terrain. All five crewmembers were killed.Blackman 2007, p. 154.Laming 2002, p. 219. * On 11 May 1964, Vulcan B.2 XH535 crashed during a demonstration. The aircraft entered a spin while a very low speed and high rate of descent was being demonstrated. The landing parachute was deployed, stopping the spin briefly before it began to spin again. At around the aircraft commander instructed the crew to abandon the aircraft. The commander and co-pilot ejected successfully, but none of the rear compartment crew did so, presumably due to the g forces in the spin.Blackman 2007, p. 155. * On 16 July 1964, Vulcan B.1A XA909 crashed in Anglesey after a midair explosion caused both No. 3 and No. 4 engines to be shut down. The explosion was caused by failure of a bearing in No. 4 engine. The starboard wing was extensively damaged, the pilot had insufficient aileron power, and both airspeed indications were highly inaccurate. The whole crew successfully abandoned XA909 and were found within a few minutes and rescued.Blackman 2007, p. 157. * On 7 October 1964, Vulcan B.2 XM601 crashed during overshoot from an asymmetric power practice approach at Coningsby. The copilot had executed the asymmetric power approach with two engines producing thrust and two at idle. He was being checked by the Squadron Commander, who was unfamiliar with the aircraft. When he commenced the overshoot the copilot moved all the throttles to full power. The engines that had been producing power reached full power more quickly than the engines at idle and the resultant asymmetric thrust exceeded the available rudder authority, causing the aircraft to spin and crash. All the crew perished.Jackson 1990, p. 178. * On 25 May 1965, Vulcan B.2 XM576 crash-landed at Scampton, causing it to be written off within a year of delivery.Brookes and Davey 2009, p. 92. * On 11 February 1966, Vulcan B.2 XH536 of IX SQN Cottesmore Wing crashed in the Brecon Beacons during a low level exercise. The aircraft struck the ground at near the summit of Fan Bwlch Chwyth , northeast of Swansea. All crew members died. Hilltops at the time were snow-covered and cloud extended down to . * On 6 April 1967, Vulcan B.2 XL385 burnt out on the runway at RAF Scampton at the beginning of its take-off run. The aircraft was carrying a Blue Steel missile training round. All the crew, including an Air Training Corps cadet, escaped unhurt. The aircraft was engulfed in flames and totally destroyed. The accident was caused by failure of an Olympus 301 HP turbine disc as the engine reached full power.Baxter 1990, p. 66. * On 30 January 1968, Vulcan B.2 XM604 crashed following a loss of control during an overshoot at RAF Cottesmore. The rear crew members were killed though both pilots ejected. The captain ejected at a very late stage and only survived because his deploying parachute was snagged by some power cables. The accident was caused by failure of an Olympus 301 LP turbine disc after the aircraft had returned to the airfield following indications of a bomb-bay overheat. * On 7 January 1971, Vulcan B.2 XM610 of No.44 Squadron crashed due to a blade fatigue failure in the No. 1 engine, damaging the fuel system and causing a fire. The crew abandoned the aircraft safely, after which it crashed harmlessly in Wingate.Blackman 2007, p. 159. * On 14 October 1975, Vulcan B.2 XM645 of No.9 Squadron lost its left undercarriage and damaged the airframe when it undershot the runway at RAF Luqa in Malta. The aircraft broke up over the town of \u017babbar while turning inbound for an emergency landing. The pilot and co-pilot escaped using their ejection seats, the other five crew members were killed. Large aircraft pieces fell on the town; one woman, Vincenza Zammit, was killed by an electric cable, some 20 others were injured.\"Extract from National Archives: Ref no. BT 20/12628 report on crash.\" National Archives. Retrieved: 24 August 2010. * On 17 January 1977, Vulcan B.2 XM600 of No. 101 Squadron crashed near Spilsby, Lincolnshire. During a practice emergency descent, the bomb bay fire warning light flashed on followed by No.2 engine fire warning light. The captain shut the engine down and the AEO reported flames coming from the area of No.2 engine, just behind the deployed Ram air turbine (RAT). As the fire intensified, the captain ordered the aircraft to be abandoned. The three rear crew members escaped at around . After ordering the co-pilot to eject, the captain ejected at around , as control was lost. The cause was due to arcing on the RAT's electrical terminals, burning a hole in an adjacent fuel pipe and setting the fuel on fire.Blackman 2007, p. 162. * On 12 August 1978, Vulcan B.2 XL390 of No. 617 Squadron crashed during an air display at Naval Air Station Glenview, Illinois in the United States. The crew had been authorized to carry out a display at Chicago's Meigs Field airport; the captain had elected to carry out an unauthorized display at Glenview beforehand. After a low-level run, probably below , the aircraft pulled up for an improperly executed wingover, resulting in a low-level stall and crash, killing all on board.Blackman 2007, p. 153. * On 3 June 1982, Vulcan XM597 broke its probe while attempting to refuel in flight, while returning from a mission over the Falkland Islands. With insufficient fuel to reach its base on Ascension Island, the pilot discarded classified information over the Atlantic Ocean and diverted to Rio de Janeiro. Shortly after entering Brazilian airspace, the Brazilian Air Force sent two Northrop F-5s to escort the British plane until it landed on Gale\u00e3o Air Force Base. This led to high-level diplomatic talks between the UK and Brazil, which remained neutral during the Falklands War. After seven days of detainment, the Vulcan and its crew were allowed to return home on the condition that XM597 play no further part in the conflict. * On 28 May 2012, Vulcan B.2 XH558 suffered failure of the two port engines while starting a take-off roll from Robin Hood airport, Doncaster, UK. Bags of silica gel desiccant were inadvertently left in the air intake after maintenance. Less than a second after increasing power from 80% to 100% these were ingested by one of the port engines, immediately destroying it. The remaining port engine ingested debris from the first engine, destroying this one as well. The fire prevention systems proved effective, neither the airframe nor control systems suffered damage. The pilot had no difficulty bringing the aircraft to a safe stop, having remained on the ground throughout. On 3 July 2012, XH558 returned to flight. ==Surviving aircraft== Several Vulcans survive, housed in museums in both the United Kingdom and North America (USA and Canada). One Vulcan, XH558 (G-VLCN) Spirit of Great Britain, was used as a display aircraft by the RAF as part of the Vulcan Display Flight until 1993. After being grounded, it was later restored to flight by the Vulcan To The Sky Trust and displayed as a civilian aircraft from 2008 until 2015, before being retired a second time for engineering reasons. In retirement, XH558 is to be retained at its base at Doncaster Sheffield Airport as a taxiable aircraft, a role already performed by two other survivors, XL426 (G-VJET) based at Southend Airport, and XM655 (G-VULC), based at Wellesbourne Mountford Airfield. ==Specifications (B.1)== ===Comparison of variants=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |+ Variants comparedPilot's Notes AP 4505-C PNAircrew Manual AP 101B-1902-15 |- ! style=\"width:15%;\"| ! style=\"width:17%;\"|B.1 ! style=\"width:17%;\"|B.1A ! style=\"width:17%;\"|B.2 ! style=\"width:17%;\"|B.2 (MRR) ! style=\"width:17%;\"|K.2 |- !
