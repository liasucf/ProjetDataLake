    "text": "Cloghamon Mill is a song dating from around 1815 in Wexford, Ireland. It describes a mill built near Newtownbarry (now Bunclody), though there are no known surviving records of such a mill. Lyrics You gods of brilliant genius that's endowed with elocution And by versification have immortalized your name Revive my drooping intellect, I crave a contribution Of assistance while I harmonize with eloquence my theme Forgive me not for rashness to attempt impossibilities Though I am stimulated by a motive of goodwill Though an inexperienced tyro in the dawn of native literature I intend to state the praises of Cloghamon's brand new mill This magnificent structure of divine architecture We built in anno domini eighteen and sixteen When by final perseverance it was brought to an accomplishment Its like was seldom ever seen in Erin the green To give a good idea about its spaciousness and symmetry Is far beyond the limits of my feeble poet's pen But in every direction tis a bulwark of perfection Hibernia's boast and glory is Cloghamon's brand new mill No wonder I should deem it an object of astonishment When men of great discernment came from near and far To view this lofty building, of which it is related That it was prognosticated by a great fiery star These grand configurations, the beauty of creation, Was brought to calculation by astronomical skill Twas perspicuously expounded and foretold there would be founded Near the town of Newtonberry an admirable mill Now the gentry of this country, for rural recreation, The sweet meandering banks of the Slaney do serenade Where the beauties of nature are arranged in true reality And the white trout is abounding in each crystal cascade When on this lofty building you feast your curiosity And view each grand invention of artifice and skill The critical machinery and curious elevation Obtained great approbation for Cloghamon's brand new mill ==See also== *Traditional Irish Singers *Roud Folk Song Index Category:Irish songs Category:1810s songs Category:Year of song unknown Category:Songwriter unknown ",
