    "text": "Hamid Naderi Yeganeh (; born July 26, 1990 in Iran) is an Iranian mathematical artist and digital artist. He is known for using mathematical formulas to create drawings of real-life objects, intricate illustrations, animations, fractals and tessellations. Naderi Yeganeh uses mathematics as the main tool to create artworks. Therefore, his artworks can be totally described by mathematical concepts. Mahematical concepts he uses in his work include trigonometric functions, exponential function, Fibonacci sequence, sawtooth wave, etc. His artwork 9,000 Ellipses was used as the background cover image of The American Mathematical Monthly \u2013 November 2017. His artwork Heart was used as the image for the February page of the 2019 Calendar of Mathematical Imagery published by the American Mathematical Society. His artwork Bird was used as the postcard image of the Art \u2229 Math exhibit held at Center on Contemporary Art, Seattle in 2018. One of the Naderi Yeganeh's artworks was used as the cover image for Newsletter of Iranian Mathematical Society, Autumn 2015. His works including A Bird in Flight and Boat have been used on several pages of the International Mathematical Knowledge Trust (IMKT)'s website. ==Works== ===Drawings of real-life objects=== A Bird in Flight, by Hamid Naderi Yeganeh is an example of drawing real-life objects with math. Naderi Yeganeh has introduced two methods to draw real-life objects with mathematical formulas. In the first method, he creates tens of thousands of computer- generated mathematical figures to find a few interesting shapes accidentally. For example, by using this method, he found some shapes that resemble birds, fishes and sailing boats. In the second method, he draws a real life object with a step-by-step process. In each step, he tries to find out which mathematical formulas will produce the drawing. For example, by using this method, he drew birds in flight, butterflies, human faces and plants using trigonometric functions. Naderi Yeganeh says: \"In order to create such shapes, it is very useful to know the properties of the trigonometric functions\". ===Fractals and tessellations=== He has designed some fractals and tessellations inspired by the continents. For example, in 2015, he described the fractal Africa with an Africa-like octagon and its lateral inversion. And he has created tessellations with Northern America-like and South America-like polygons. ==Comments on his work== In 2015, CNN used the queastion \"Is this the next da Vinci?\" for the title of a video about Naderi Yeganeh's work and RT en Espa\u00f1ol used the question \"New da Vinci?\" at the beginning of the title of an article about him and Al Arabiya used this question for the article about Naderi Yeganeh: \"Is this Iranian student da Vinci's successor?\". And Iranian media such as IRNA and Isfahan Ziba titled him as \"The Iranian da Vinci\" and \"Iran's da Vinci\" in their articles about Hamid Naderi Yeganeh. In 2015, The National Museum of Mathematics stated in a post on Facebook that \"Hamid Naderi Yeganeh takes graphing art to the next level!\" In 2016, Institute for Mathematics and its Applications commented on the Naderi Yeganeh's blog post showing how to draw human faces with mathematical equations: \"Another reason that math wins\". In 2016, COSMOS raised this question in the introduction to its interview with Hamid Naderi Yeganeh: \"Why couldn't high school mathematics be more like this?\" in order to get its readers thinking about the potential of using Naderi Yeganeh's work in mathematics education. In 2016, Mathematics in Education and Industry stated in a tweet that: \"Hamid Naderi Yeganeh is a mathematical artist who's created plant images by trigonometric functions.\" In 2016, Barbour Design Inc. stated on its own blog that \"These often delicately intricate works are quite remarkable, and more astounding is that Yeganeh writes computer programs based on mathematical equations to produce them.\" In 2017, Mathematical Association of America commented about one of Naderi Yeganeh's animations in a tweet: \"Watch the beauty of trigonometric functions come alive\". In 2017, Fields Institute described Naderi Yeganeh's work as \"beautiful math\" in a tweet. In 2017, Berkeley Lab commented on one of Naderi Yeganeh's blog posts: \"Create stunning symmetrical images armed with a few equations and a computer\". In 2015, Asia Society Philippines stated in a post on Facebook that \"Hamid Naderi Yeganeh reveals the beauty of Math through Art\". == Views == Naderi Yeganeh believes that there are an infinite number of ways of using mathematical tools in art. In 2015, in an interview with CNN Style he said: \"The power of mathematics is unlimited. There's an infinite number of great artworks that we can create\". He says, \"I don\u2019t think computer-made art clashes with human creativity, but it can change the role of artists.\u201d In 2016, He said in an interview with Dong-A Science: \"For me, mathematics is the best tool to create works of art.\" Hamid Naderi Yeganeh believes that introducing mathematical objects that resemble real recognizable things may encourage young people to pursue mathematics. He believes mathematics is an international culture and mathematics can help to promote peace and love between nations. Naderi Yeganeh believes that Pi is an international number and it can be a symbol of peace between nations. ==Education== Naderi Yeganeh received his bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of Qom and a M.Sc. in Pure Mathematics from Sharif University of Technology. He won a gold medal at the 38th Iranian Mathematical Society\u2019s nationwide mathematics competition held at Graduate University of Advanced Technology in May 2014 and a silver medal at the 39th IMS\u2019s nationwide mathematics competition held at Yazd University in May 2015. == Exhibitions and conferences == * Art \u2229 Math, Center on Contemporary Art (Seattle, WA), March 1 - April 14, 2018. * The Intersection of Art + Math, Schack Art Center (Everett, WA), April 26 - June 2, 2018. *LASER Talks in Tehran, Leonardo, the International Society for the Arts, Sciences and Technology (Tehran, Iran), August 10, 2018. ==Gallery== Below are some examples of Yeganeh's mathematical figures: {|style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"|align=left | Heart by Hamid Naderi Yeganeh 2014 | A Bird in Flight by Hamid Naderi Yeganeh 2015 | Boat by Hamid Naderi Yeganeh 2015 | Flowers by Hamid Naderi Yeganeh |} ==References== ==External links== *Mathematical Concepts Illustrated by Hamid Naderi Yeganeh at American Mathematical Society *Hamid Naderi Yeganeh's blog posts in The Huffington Post *http://alum.sharif.edu/~naderiyeganeh Category:Mathematical artists Category:Digital artists Category:Living people Category:Iranian designers Category:Fractal artists Category:Iranian contemporary artists Category:1990 births Category:Sharif University of Technology alumni Category:Iranian Mathematics Competition Medalists Category:Iranian mathematicians Category:21st-century male artists Category:People from Qom Category:Digital art Category:HuffPost bloggers ",
