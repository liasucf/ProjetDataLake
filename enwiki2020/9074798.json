Some groups relying on hunting and > gathering partially retained their pre-civilizational lifestyle up to the > last century. The earliest known residents of the area are the Palaiyar (meaning \"old ones\", incorrectly translated as Paliyan), a Tamil-speaking tribal people, who have been seen in the past 35 years living in small caves in the valley. Historically close extended Palaiyar family groups foraged and hunted at least 128 forest species for subsistence. In the past century they increasingly depended on shifting cultivation and collection and trading of non timber forest products of over 60 species for: food (14), incense & toiletries (11) medicines (13), construction materials & precious woods (9) and miscellaneous (13) honey, tubers, fruits, herbs, flowers, bark, seeds, fibers, gum, leaves, logs and oils. Since establishment of the IGWS&NP; in 1976, Palaiyar trading was gradually but severely restricted. They are now allowed to collect only tamarind from one small area outside Manjampatti Valley. Their strong cultural ties to the area and traditional avoidance of outsiders keeps them attached to their forest habitat. They must now depend on intermittent plantation labor, primitive low yield cultivation in restricted areas, liaisons with forest product smugglers and poachers, government programs and charity.\"Tribal Development in India: A Case Study\", Soundarapandian M., Anmol Publications PVT. LTD., , 2001, pp. 135-147.partial text Tribal Development in India ==Communities== In 2002 there were 401 tribal persons living in three settlements within IGWS&NP; boundaries in the valley. This is an average population density of 3.65 persons/km2, 40% higher than the 2.6 persons/km2 living in all 36 tribal settlements in the entire 1769 km2 IGWS&NP.;Sajeev T.K. et al., Management of Forests in India for Biological Diversity and Forest Productivity- A New Perspective WII-USDA Forest Service Collaborative Project Grant No. FG-In-780 (In-FS-120), Volume III Anaimalai Conservation Area (ACA) pp 169 - 190.Anaimalai Conservation Area Their peaceful ancient culture in this area is increasingly fragmented as they assimilate modern Tamil customs and values.,.Gardner, Dr. Peter, Bicultural Versatility as a Frontier Adaptation among Paliyan Foragers of South India, 2000 Paliyan Foragers of South IndiaGardner, 2000, Excerpts Excerpts The villages have no link roads, no electricity (some solar lamps have been installed recently), no running water, no government school, no medical facilities and no shops.Aparna Narayanan & Bhaskar Venkateswaran, Trichirapalli Rural and Urban Welfare Development Educational Society (TRUWDES), Site visit to school for tribal children in Manjampatti village in Kodai Hills run by TRUWDES, 2007-6-26 In addition there are three villages within the valley watershed but outside the National Park boundaries: Mannavanur pop. 5,927,OurVillageIndia.org, Mannavanur Village 2007 Kumbur pop. 500,Medhaug and Kilanavayal 124 families.Directorate of Rural Development, Government of TamilNadu Group of the Household ===Thalinji=== Thalinji village at , near the bottom of the valley above the banks of the Ten Ar River, has about 150 houses (pop: m-168, f-155). Most of the people are Pulaiyar caste, early cultivators, but there are some Malaimarasar tribal people, who do agriculture and coolie work. Ancient Ganesha statue at site of ruined Kondaiamman Temple This place had some importance in medieval times, as there are mounds with 15th century ruins of a Vijayanagar Dynasty p. 267 Kondaiaman temple with a substantial temple tank, and numerous scattered stone carvings and broken statues of goddesses such as Kondaiamman and Mariamman and gods Ganesha, and Krishna, with some text inscriptions. The villagers say they know no history of the temple. The village is a ward under the Manupatti Panchayat near the Amaraavathi dam, but the people have decided to not elect a representative. They do rely on the Forest Department for many kinds of assistance and advice. When the British created the Amaravathi Reserved Forest they allocated to the village for cultivation. This was divided up among families by stone boundary markers, which still exist, but land titles were not given. Talinji houses with solar lighting Thalinji people cultivate rice (monsoon crop) and butter beans and no other vegetables or crops. They keep a few cows, buffaloes, goats, and chickens. They are allowed to collect minor forest products for their own use, but not to sell. There is a one-room Anti-Poaching Camp used intermittently by forestry staff on their rounds. There is a school with a teacher posted, and a doctor is supposed to come every week but actually comes less than once a month. Men sometimes go out to work in sugarcane fields on the plains, and women go to work in the Manjampatti fields. Thalinji has no store or tea shop. The people do not integrate well in the modern society and economy, though they have accepted Photovoltaic powered home lighting devices from the District collector. ===Manjampatti=== Fields and house at Manjampatti village Manjampatti village at , near the middle of the valley has 59 households with 191 persons (95 males and 96 females) dispersed among its many agricultural fields located inside a bend of the Ten Ar just below its junction with the Kumbar and Manalaar streams. It is ethnically more diverse than Talinji. Pulaiyar were the majority inhabitants of Manjampatti when the British gave land to the village for cultivation. About 15 families of Muthuvar, another \"tribal\" group, live in Manjampatti village where they do cultivation and labor work. Some Theivar people, a widespread plains agricultural jaathi (caste), came to live in Manjampatti long ago and engage in agriculture on the village lands. There are also a few houses of other plains jaathis such as Chakkliyar (originally leather-workers). Because of these jaathis, Manjampatti village has some features of plains Tamil villages such as eating of newer types of vegetables and having tea shops. Manjampatti comes under the Mannavanur Panchayat and sends its Ward Member up to the monthly meetings. The people receive no benefit from the Panchayat, and prefer to rely on the Forest Department. Manjampatti falls under Kodaikanal Taluk office, and the people must travel far to Kodaikanal for official services such as getting a ration card. The ration items (rice, sugar, kerosene) are sent to an agent on the Amaravaathi-Munnar Road (SH 17) where the people go to collect them. The village has a small part-time general store selling cooking items and two part-time tea shops. There is a basic primary school of a type designed for tribal people, which is able to provide Transfer Certificates (TC) to students. Forest Department Anti-Poaching Camp There is a Forest Department Anti-Poaching Camp with four full-time staff. There is a polling station at the Hydro Matric Survey Building in Manjampatti for all voters from Manjampatti, Muthuvankudi and Mungilpallam (Mannavanur (r.v) Ward-5).R.Vasuki, I.A.S., District Election Officer & District Collector, 16/07/2008, Dindigul, List of Polling Stations for 127 Palani Assembly Segment within the 22 DINDIGUL Parliamentary Constituency, Polling station No. 205 The village has a Moopan (headman), assisted by a group of elder men, who organizes activities such as maintaining irrigation channels and resolving disputes, but this position is not recognized in the Panchayat system. The Moopan can be of any caste, and serves as long as he has the confidence of the people. If someone commits a serious crime, the Moopan will turn the suspect over to the Forest Department, which will arrange for him to be detained by police on the plains. Manjampatti was given land for cultivation when the Reserved Forest was created and the families have kept their respective fields marked with the original stone boundaries. Villagers earlier practiced shifting cultivation, growing millets such as raagi, thinai and kambu. Later the Forest Department forbade shifting cultivation and restricted cultivation to the allotted lands. The crops now are rice in rainy season and butter beans otherwise, though with a more diverse population a few vegetables such as eggplant and tomatoes are grown. Farmers here have to protect their crops from wild elephants, gaur, wild boar, deer and sometimes peacocks. A complex and well maintained system of small canals distributes water from the Manalar to irrigate the fields. Muduvankudi is a neighboring village inhabited by Muduvar (Muthuvar), and is a 15-minute trek from Manjampatti. ===Mungilpallam=== Mungilpallam villageMungilpallam (Moongilpallam) village at , at the headwaters of the TenAr, the third village going up the valley, is a hamlet of just 20 houses of Pulaiyar people (pop: m-22, f-18), on the north side and above the Kumbaar stream. They practice some shifting cultivation on their south facing slope. There is a steep cliff trail from here which leads east to Kumboor village at the end of the road from Kodaikanal. There are 24 Muduvan and Paliyan families living there. They were said to have migrated from Manjampatti 200 years ago because of their fear of herds of wild elephants. They originally lived in caves. They eat wild roots, maize, fruits from wild plants, honey and bamboo rice. Their limited income comes from selling bamboo products and lemon grass oil, which they spend to buy rice from other villages. These people are nature worshippers. They do not worship regularly or have a particular place of worship but have a sacred area in their village. They visit this area to celebrate the harvest festival Pongal and the rain (Mari) festival, during which they sacrifice a goat. They believe that diseases are manifestations of punishment inflicted by God. Till recently they only took native medicines. A witch doctor from the community was summoned for assessment and further treatment of serious illness. If the witch doctor's said the patient would die, food and medicines were withdrawn and the patient kept in a small hut away other until he or she died. In 2005, more than 50% of the children here suffered from severe chronic malnutrition.Medhaug Endre, Faculty of Medicine, Trompso, Norway, Malnutrition in the Children around Kodaikanal, Tamil Nadu, India June 2005, p. 35 Inside the Mungilpallam school Since 1995, a registered Christian charity \"Tribal Education and Medicare Vision\" (Team Vision) has assisted the villagers to get identity cards and ration cards from the Revenue Department and Civil Supplies Department. Also, corrugated steel sheets were provided for home roofing. 18 new huts were erected in a new location in 1999. The Forest Department helped the villagers lay stones on the tortuous way to the village. They also erected two solar lamps. A kindergarten school was started and 20 children were enrolled in 1998. In 2005, 9 children from Mungilpallam were attending elementary and secondary school in Kodaikanal.Lawrence Dr. Bevin G., orphanage.org Team Vision Children's Home 2005-7-29 Maangapaarai is another remote settlement and highly inaccessible because of bison attacks. ==Geography== Manjampatti Valley Drainage Basin Topographical map Alanthoni Falls This Valley forms the southeast part of Anaimalai Reserve Forest, in Udumalaipettai Block, Coimbatore District,GIS DIVISION - National Informatics Centre-Tamil Nadu, Map: Coimbatore District, Udumalaipettai Block, Anaimalai Reserve Forest Map, Anaimalai Reserve Forest about 13 km south of Amaravathi Reservoir and Dam on SH 17 and 30 km West of Kodaikanal at the western border of Dindigul District in the Palni Hills of the Western Ghats mountain range. Central location is .

(4,577 ft) The valley is surrounded by a ridgeline connecting several prominent peaks listed in order clockwise from the northwest corner. Starting at the Amaravathy River the ridge climbs to *Tavatti Malai *Unnamed *Chinna Mudi Malai *Mudian Malai , *Unnamed *Pappalamman Malai *Vellari Malai *Unnamed at Kilanavayal *Paratumba *Kalabhaathur Malai *Kadavaari *Vellingiri Malai *Jambu Malai *Palappatti . From here the ridge drops to the Amaravathi River.Department of Science and Technology, Survey of India, Topographical map, Amaravathi Range, scale 1:50,000 The western ridge of Manjampatti Valley extends 2 km into the easternmost area of Idukki District, Kerala and adjoins the 90 km2 Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary. ==Rivers== The Manjampatti Valley catchment basin drains into the Chinnar River from the Athioda Stream and to the Amaravathi River from the Kajadaikatti Odai Ar and Ten Ar Rivers to the east. Athioda Stream NW of Talinji Athioda is the north to south political and physical boundary for between Tamil Nadu and Kerala between the end of the Pambar River and the top of Jambumalai peak at the trijunction of Coimbatore and Dindugul Districts and Kerala State. (This peak is locally known as Chinna Chambu Malai). The top of the ridge to the west above Athioda is the western limit of the catchment. Thus, the western edge of Manjampatti valley extends up to 2 km into Kerala. Athioda stream joins the Pambar River at the point they both join the Chinnar River at the north west corner of the Valley. West of this point, the Chinnar River forms the boundary between the Indira Gandhi National Park in Tamil Nadu and the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary in Kerala. East of this point, the Chinnar river becomes the Amaravati River in Tamil Nadu. Ten Ar River at Talinji The Ten Ar River is fed from most of the valley by the Kumbar stream, the Manalaar River (\"sand river\"), the Kalyanivalasu Odai and other smaller tributaries from the higher forests and sholas to the east. At the northwest end of the valley, the Ten Ar is joined by the Varavandi Odai stream flowing from a smaller adjacent valley to the east and soon joins the Amaravati River down stream to the west. The Amaravati River then flows north to the Amaravathi Reservoir and Dam and then to the Cauvery River. The Kudiraiyar River basin, including Kukkal village, is just over the northeast ridge of the valley behind Vellari Malai. ==Wildlife== Indian tiger Manjampatti Valley currently supports stable breeding populations of several large mammal species including apex predators critical to healthy populations of smaller animals. In colonial times Indian tigers (Tamil: puli or \u0baa\u0bc1\u0bb2\u0bbf ) were common in this area and as recently as the 1950s the Raja of Puthukkottai would go out from his house in Kodaikanal and hunt them. At least one tiger has been shot here within the past fifty five years.Sherman Marcus Manjampatti Valley Notes , (2007) Two tigers, a male and a female, were sighted and recorded in the 2007 wildlife census. Tiger populations in the adjoining areas of IGWS&NP; and the nearby Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve could expand back into this area if they and their prey species were better protected. The census estimated 10 to 20 panthers (Tamil: sirutthai) living in the Manjampatti Valley. Wild Indian elephants roam over the whole valley. Sloth bears (Tamil: karadi) are sighted every year in the upper forests of Manjampatti valley. Nilgiri tahr (Tamil: varaiaadu) live especially on the spectacular high rocky peaks around the valley, as Mudimalai, Jambumalai, and Attumalai, though they may also be seen in the valley forests. There are several herds of gaur (popularly called bison) (Tamil: kaattu erumai, \"forest buffalo\") in the valley. Earlier the area was well known for Manjampatti white bison. This possible sub-species has recently been seen and photographed here by Forest Department staff. Unidentified at 1,700 m Wild boar (Tamil: kaattu panri) live all over the Palani Hills (Tamil: \u0baa\u0bb4\u0ba9\u0bbf) and in Manjampatti Valley, where one can frequently see holes in the ground where they have dug for edible roots. The valley has the large mountain squirrel (Tamil: malai-anil) and the ash-colored squirrel (Tamil: saambalnira anil). There are wild peacocks, jungle fowl, and many other bird species enumerated in the Wildlife Census. There are no known studies of the many reptiles, amphibians, insects, invertebrates or plants living in the valley. ==Visitor information== Manjampatti valley is a core zone of the Indira Gandhi National Park. Tourism, hiking, camping and non- resident visitation of the villages is prohibited. A permit is required for serious researchers to work inside the valley.
