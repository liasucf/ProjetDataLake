The franchise expanded into comic books, music and television series (such as Adiboo Adventure (2009)). Titles in the series follow Adiboo, a young boy who teaches children about a variety of topics including nature, maths, and language. Most stories are set in the world of Celesta. The series is divided into different categories based on target market: Adi for 10-14 year-olds, Adibou for 4-7 year-olds, and Adiboud'chou for 18 months-3 year-olds, and characters have different names in different regions. The name Adibou is derived from the French acronym ADI meaning Accompagnement Didacticiel Intelligent (English: Intelligent Accompaniment Tutorial). Adibou games were initially developed in ScummVM's \"Gob\" engine. The series was created by Muriel Tramis, the first female French video game designer according to la Croix. The games were designed specifically to be applicable within a classroom context. In October 2005, Coktel Vision was sold to French publisher Mindscape which itself closed in 2011.Poischich (21 October 2005). \"VU Games c\u00e8de Coktel \u00e0 Mindscape\" [VU Games sells Coktel to Mindscape].
