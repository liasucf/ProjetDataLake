Hjalp buri es vi\u00f0r \u00fe\u00e6ima v\u00e6rki. Auk dverg unninn. B\u014durr. *Ulfr and Odin and High-tiur. Buri is help against this pain. And the dwarf (is) overcome. B\u00f3urr. Where \"Ulfr\" may refer to the wolf Fenrir, \"Odin\" to the god Odin, \"High-tiur\" to the god T\u00fdr and \"Buri\" to the god B\u00fari. It has been suggested that the existence of a hole in the fragment may indicate its use as an amulet. However, there is a general lack of wear of the type that would be expected if it had been used in this way. ==References== Category:Runic inscriptions Category:Archaeological discoveries in Denmark ",
