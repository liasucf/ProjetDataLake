    "text": "Propane refrigeration is a type of compression refrigeration. Propane (R290) has been used successfully in industrial refrigeration for many years, and is emerging as an increasingly viable alternative for homes and businesses. Propane's operating pressures and temperatures are well suited for use in air conditioning equipment, but because of propane\u2019s flammability, great care is required in the manufacture, installation and servicing of equipment that uses it as a refrigerant. Propane that is supplied for general use \u2013 such as in barbeques and patio heaters \u2013 is not suitable for use in refrigeration systems because it can contain high levels of contaminants, including moisture and unsaturated hydrocarbons. Only propane produced specifically for use in refrigeration systems \u2013 with a purity of at least 98.5% and moisture content below 10ppm (by weight) \u2013 should be used.ICIBSE Journal Propane as a refrigerant for use in chillers for air conditioning applications With a global warming potential (GWP) of 3 and an ozone depletion potential (ODP) of 0, R-290 is of very little threat to the environment. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has listed R-290 as an acceptable refrigerant substitute under its Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP), and recently exempted it from the venting prohibition in Section 608 of the Clean Air Act.United States Environmental Protection Agency, Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP), Substitutes in Household Refrigerators and Freezers ==References== Category:Thermodynamic cycles Category:Chemical processes Category:Cooling technology Category:Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning Category:Industrial processes Category:Gas technologies Refrigeration ",
