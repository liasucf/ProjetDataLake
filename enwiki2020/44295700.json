    "text": "The Alabama gubernatorial election of 1966 took place on November 8, 1966, and saw the election of Lurleen Wallace as Governor over U.S. Representative James D. Martin. Incumbent Democrat George Wallace was term limited and could not seek a second consecutive term. ==Democratic Primary== ===Candidates=== * Carl Elliott, former U.S. Representative * Richmond Flowers, Sr., Attorney General * Jim Folsom, former Governor * Bob Gilchrist, State Senator * Eunice Gore * John Malcolm Patterson, former Governor * Sherman Powell * A.W. Todd, Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries * Lurleen Wallace, First Lady * Charles Woods, businessman ===Results=== The Democratic primary was handily won by Lurleen Wallace, who was running as the proxy of her husband, governor George Wallace. Wallace captured a majority of the vote cast in the first round of the primary and there was therefore no runoff necessary. Purple denotes a county carried by Wallace, and Green by Flowers. ==General Election== Until 1966, the official election of the Democratic nominee had been a foregone conclusion. This election proved to be a significant departure from that trend, and the showing of James D. Martin proved to the best by a Republican candidate for governor in Alabama since reconstruction. *Lurleen Burns Wallace 537,505 (63.38%) *James D. Martin 262,943 (31.00%) *Carl Robinson 47,653 (5.62%) 1966 Gubernatorial Alabama Category:November 1966 events ",
