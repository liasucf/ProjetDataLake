    "text": "The 2019-20 RFU Championship Cup was the second season of the annual rugby union Championship Cup competition for second tier, professional English clubs playing in the RFU Championship. The competition ended without a winner after the quarter-final stage due to the premature end of the RFU Championship season due to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom. ==Competition format== The competition format is a pool stage followed by a knockout stage. The pool stage consists of three pool of four teams each playing home and away matches. Pool matches ran from September through to December, on weekends when there is no RFU Championship league fixtures. In the inaugural season, the RFU had set out the pools in a regional format to encourage derby games, but this year's competition format was more loosely structured. The top two sides in each pool, plus the two best third placed teams, progressed to the knockout stage, with the best ranked sides getting home advantage in the quarter-finals. The semi-finals and final were cancelled. ==Participating teams and locations== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Team !Ground !Capacity !City/Area |- | Ampthill || Dillingham Park || 3,000 || Ampthill, Bedfordshire |- | Bedford Blues || Goldington Road || 5,000 (1,700 seats) || Bedford, Bedfordshire |- | Cornish Pirates || Mennaye Field || 4,000 (2,200 seats) || Penzance, Cornwall |- | Coventry || Butts Park Arena || 4,000 (3,000 seats) || Coventry, West Midlands |- | Doncaster Knights || Castle Park || 5,000 (1,650 seats) || Doncaster, South Yorkshire |- | Ealing Trailfinders || Trailfinders Sports Ground || 4,000 (2,200 seats) || West Ealing, London |- | Hartpury || Gillman's Ground || 2,000 || Hartpury, Gloucestershire |- | Jersey Reds || Stade Santander International || 4,000 || Saint Peter, Jersey |- | London Scottish || Athletic Ground || 4,500 (1,000 seats) || Richmond, London, London |- | Newcastle Falcons || Kingston Park || 10,500 || Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Tyne and Wear |- | Nottingham || Lady Bay Sports Ground || 3,500 || Nottingham, Nottinghamshire |- | Yorkshire Carnegie || The Sycamores || N/A || Bramhope, West Yorkshire |- |} ==Pool stage== ===Pool 1 === {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- |colspan=\"15\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"| {|border=\"0\" width=\"80%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" |- |width=20% style=\"border:0px\"| |style=\"border:0px\"|Pool 1 |width=20% style=\"border:0px\" align=right| |} |- !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"| !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"195\"|Club !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Played !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Won !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Drawn !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Lost !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Points For !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Points Against !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Points Difference !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Tries For !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Tries Against !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Try Bonus !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Losing Bonus !bgcolor=\"#efefef\" width=\"20\"|Points |- bgcolor=#d8ffeb align=center | 1 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Ealing Trailfinders (Q) || 6 || 6 || 0 || 0 || 282 || 107 || 175 || 40 || 14 || 4 || 0 || 28 |- bgcolor=#ccccff align=center | 2 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Coventry (Q) || 6 || 4 || 0 || 2 || 210 || 150 || 60 || 30 || 21 || 3 || 1 || 20 |- | 3 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Ampthill || 6 || 2 || 0 || 4 || 112 || 204 || -92 || 16 || 31 || 2 || 1 || 11 |- | 4 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Bedford Blues || 6 || 0 || 0 || 6 || 98 || 242 || -144 || 12 || 32 || 1 || 1 || 2 |- |-| style=\"text-align:left;\" | |colspan=\"15\"| *If teams are level at any stage, tiebreakers are applied in the following order: # Number of matches won # Total number of tries scored # Total number of points for # Difference between points for and against # Fewest red cards # Coin toss |-| style=\"text-align:left;\" | |colspan=\"15\" style=\"border:0px\"| Green background means the club has qualified for the quarter-finals as either pool winner or best runner-up.
