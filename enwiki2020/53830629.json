He died of cancer on 19 April 2017. A section of the M3 expressway into Cape Town was renamed Philip Kgosana Drive in his honour, as this formed part of his 1960 march. It was formerly known as De Waal Drive, after Nicolaas Frederic de Waal, the former Administrator of the Cape Province who initiated its construction in the early 1900s. ==References== Category:Anti-apartheid activists Category:1936 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Pan Africanist Congress of Azania politicians ",
