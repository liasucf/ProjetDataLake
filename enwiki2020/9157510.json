    "text": "The New York Musical Festival (NYMF) was an annual three-week summer festival which presented more than thirty new musicals at venues in New York City's midtown theater district. More than half of these productions are chosen by leading theater artists and producers through an open-submission, double-blind evaluation process; the remaining shows are invited to participate by the Festival's artistic staff. There were sixteen iterations of NYMF in total, one every year from 2004 to 2019. The festival premiered over 447 musicals, which have featured the work of over 8,000 artists and have been attended by 300,000 theatergoers. Over 100 NYMF shows have gone on to further productions, with NYMF alumni productions having been produced in all fifty U.S. states and in 27 countries worldwide, having been seen by approximately four million people. , The Official Site of The New York Musical Theatre Festival. Over twenty NYMF shows have had cast albums recorded. ==History== In addition to full productions, NYMF presents a wide range of special events, readings and concerts of new music, educational seminars, explorations of musicals in TV and film, and unusual collaborations with other New York-based arts organizations. In 2011, The Festival introduced NYMF meets NYMIF, partnering with the New York Musical Improv Festival in a weekly series in which NYMF performers were paired with performers from the Magnet Theater to create completely improvised musicals. In 2005, the Festival featured a series of co- productions with the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater exploring the nexus of improvisation and musical theater. NYMF has also partnered with The Paley Center each season to present special screenings of Musicals on Television. , The Paley Center's Musicals on Television Series.

NYMF also featured a Dance Series, celebrating the fusion of musical theatre and dance. Each series included one new musical commissioned by the Festival: Common Grounds (2006), Platforms (2007), Wild About Harry (2008), and Andy Warhol Was Right (2009). During the off season, NYMF produced a number of concerts, from large star-studded evenings like \"The Unauthorized Musicology of Ben Folds\", to intimate events like a salon with composer Duncan Sheik. It also operated a year-round writer service program, The Next Link Project, which provided dramaturgical, professional, entrepreneurial and financial support to help writers bring their musicals to fruition as fully staged productions. The Next Link Project culminated with twelve writing teams each year receiving subsidized productions in NYMF's fall Festival. Playbill article on 2010 Next Link Project Selections.

However, it lost a major investor a month before its scheduled opening, when the cast was already in rehearsal, and the opening was cancelled. On January 2, 2020, NYMF abruptly announced that it was shutting down, ceasing operations immediately. ==NYMF Awards for Excellence== At the end of every festival starting in 2006, a jury of Broadway professionals gave out awards for excellence to the deserving productions in that year's festival. There is also a \"Best of Fest\" award that the public votes for. 2013 was the only year where the public and the jury agreed on a best musical (Volleygirls). The NYMF Awards do not serve as a good barometer for future success. Only one musical that won \"Most Promising New Musical\" has had an off-Broadway production: A Letter to Harvey Milk (NYMF '12). Two \"Best of Fest\" winners have been seen Off-Broadway: Unlock'd (NYMF '07) and Fat Camp (NYMF '09). {|class=\"wikitable\" | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Year | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|\"Best of Fest\" Audience Prize | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Most Promising New Musical | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Theater for the American Musical Prize | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Excellence in Writing (Music) | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Excellence in Writing (Lyrics) | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Excellence in Writing (Book) | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Excellence in Direction | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Excellence in Choreography | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Excellence in Overall Design | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Outstanding Orchestrations | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Outstanding Ensemble Performance |- |2019 |Show: Overture Concert: The Oldenburg Suite Reading: Mississippi |Leaving Eden | |Buried |Leaving Eden |Buried |Till |Flying Lessons |Leaving Eden | |Flying Lessons |- |2018 |Show: An American Hero Concert: Fatty Fatty No Friends Reading: Legacy |Between the Sea and Sky | |Between the Sea and Sky |Interstate |Peter, Who? |Between the Sea and Sky |Emojiland |Between the Sea and Sky |Sonata 1962 |Between the Sea and Sky AND Emojiland |- | 2017||Show: Errol and Fidel Concert: Dorian Gray ||Generation Me || ||Freedom Riders||Georama||Generation Me||Georama||Errol and Fidel||Georama ||Errol and Fidel||Generation Me |- | 2016||Show: Children of Salt Concert: Illa!
