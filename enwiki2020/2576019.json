    "text": "Actephila is a genus of plants in the family Phyllanthaceae, first described as a genus in 1826. It is one of 8 genera in the tribe Poranthereae, and is most closely related to Leptopus. The name of the genus is derived from two Greek words, akte, \"the seashore\", and philos, \"loving\". It refers to a coastal habitat.Umberto Quattrocchi. 2000. CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names volume I. CRC Press: Boca Raton; New York; Washington,DC;, USA. London, UK. (vol. I). (see External links below). Actephila consists of monoecious trees, shrubs, and subshrubs. The genus is not well understood and is in much need of revision. It is native to Southeast Asia, China, the Himalayas, Papuasia and northern Australia.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant FamiliesFlora of China Vol. 11 Page 168 \u559c\u5149\u82b1\u5c5e xi guang hua shu Actephila Blume, Bijdr. 581. 1826. ;Species ;Formerly included moved to other genera: Cleidion Excoecaria Pentabrachion Phyllanthus == References == == External links == * Actephila At:ING At: References At: NMNH Department of Botany At: Research and Collections At: Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History * CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names: A-C At: Botany & Plant Science At: Life Science At: CRC Press Category:Phyllanthaceae Category:Phyllanthaceae genera Category:Taxa named by Carl Ludwig Blume ",
