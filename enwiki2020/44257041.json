    "text": "Queerbaiting is a marketing technique for fiction and entertainment in which creators hint at, but then do not actually depict, same-sex romance or other LGBTQ representation. They do so to attract (\"bait\") a queer or straight ally audience with the suggestion of relationships or characters that appeal to them, while at the same time attempting to avoid alienating other consumers. Queerbaiting has been observed in popular fiction such as films and television series, as well as in celebrities who convey an ambiguous sexual identity through their works and statements. It arose in and has been popularized through discussions in Internet fandom since the early 2010s. == Assessments == ===Queer audience concerns=== Queer fans have reacted with concern and anger to an identity they consider defining being used as a mere marketing ploy, a plaything for creatives, a mark of \"edginess\", or a commodity. Fans have derided, for instance, queer characters being used as plot devices rather than as characters for their own sake. For instance, Glee, a series with many queer series regulars, was criticized by fans for presenting \"superficial stereotypes of queerness for dramatic effect\". Queer fans consider queerbaiting as \"a way to throw us a bone when we normally wouldn't have anything, to acknowledge that we're there in the audience when the powers that be would prefer to ignore us\". Emmet Scout wrote that \"queerbaiting works on its audience because it offers the suggestion that queer people do have a vital place in these stories, that they might even be the defining figures, the heroes. The suggestion\u2014but not the reality.\" Rose Bridges summarized the practice's effect on queer fans as receiving \"just enough [representation] to keep us interested, but not enough to satisfy us and make us truly represented.\" ===Societal shifts=== According to media scholars, the perceived increase in queerbaiting reflects a shift towards a more positive perception of queer relationships in modern societies\u2014and therefore, in a sense, societal progress. However, the same societal shift has also increased expectations by queer fans as to the quality and authenticity of queer representation\u2014they demand not just any representation at all, but rather \"respectful and meaningful depictions\" of their relationships. That is why, according to media researcher Eve Ng, the ambiguous sexuality projected by twentieth century entertainers such as David Bowie, Elton John and Madonna was not scrutinized to the same degree as that of their successors. == Examples == ===Fiction=== In fiction, the following characters, or relationships between characters of the same sex, have been interpreted as examples of queerbaiting by at least some reliable media sources. This interpretation is not necessarily shared by all critics or fans. ====Television==== * 9-1-1: Evan \"Buck\" Buckley and Edmundo \"Eddie\" Diaz.name=https://tvline.com/2019/01/01/911-buck-eddie-gay- storyline-season-2-interview/ * Glee: Rachel Berry and Quinn Fabray. * Killing Eve: Eve and Villanelle. The series was criticized for queerbaiting in seasons 1 and 2, but the characters eventually kissed in season 3, after which critics reassessed the series's approach to their relationship. * Merlin: Arthur Pendragon and Merlin. * Once Upon a Time: Regina Mills and Emma Swan. * Riverdale: Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge, and Archie Andrews and Joaquin DeSantos. * Rizzoli & Isles: Jane Rizzoli and Maura Isles. * Sherlock: Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. Cast and crew of Sherlock have consistently denied that the relationship is intended to be seen as romantic, to the dismay of many fans. * Supernatural: Castiel and Dean Winchester. * Supergirl: Kara Danvers and Lena Luthor. * Teen Wolf: Derek Hale and Stiles Stilinski. * Voltron: Legendary Defender: Shiro and Adam. ====Film==== * Black Panther: Okoye and Ayo. * Beauty and the Beast (2017): LeFou and Gaston. * Captain America: Civil War: Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes. * Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes Of Grindelwald: Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald. * Pitch Perfect: Beca and Chloe. * Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: Finn and Poe. * Thor: Ragnarok: Valkyrie. ===Other media=== In music, Katy Perry's 2008 song \"I Kissed a Girl\" raised concerns because, according to one reviewer, \"its appropriation of the gay lifestyle exists for the sole purpose of garnering attention\".Cinquemani, Sal (2008). \"Katy Perry - One of the Boys\" review, Slant Magazine. Posted: June 15, 2008. Retrieved June 22, 2008. Perry said in 2017 that she has done \"more than [kissing a girl]\" and is attracted to women, without specifying or labeling her sexuality. The singers Ariana Grande (in 2019) and Rita Ora (in 2018) were also criticized by fans for queerbaiting after their lyrics contained references to bisexual love. In response to these concerns, Ora came out as bisexual to her fans. In advertising, the clothing label Calvin Klein apologized in 2019 for queerbaiting the public with an advertisement in which the model Bella Hadid kissed the character Lil Miquela. In theater, the relationship between Albus Severus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was criticized as queerbaiting. == See also == * LGBT marketing * Liberal homophobia * Pink capitalism * Pinkwashing == References == == Further reading == * * * * * Category:LGBT terminology Category:LGBT portrayals in mass media Category:Discrimination against LGBT people ",
