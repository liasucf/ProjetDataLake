Initially , it was expanded to 600 acres (2.4 km\u00b2) in 1905, but reduced to 461 acres (1.9 km\u00b2) in 1912, when a portion was sold to the neighboring Gate of Heaven Cemetery. Several baseball players are buried in this cemetery. Many entertainment figures of the early twentieth century, including the Russian- born Sergei Rachmaninoff, were buried here. The cemetery has a special section for members of the Actors' Fund of America and the National Vaudeville Association, some of whom died in abject poverty. Sharon Gardens is a section of Kensico Cemetery, which was created in 1953 for Jewish burials. ==Notable interments in Kensico division== * Richard Abbott (1899\u20131986), actor * Virginia Admiral (1915\u20132000), painter and poet, mother of Robert De Niro * Hadji Ali (c. 1887-92\u20131937), vaudeville performance artist * Elizabeth Akers Allen (1832\u20131911), author and poet * Glenn Anders (1889\u20131981), American actor * Edward Franklin Albee II (1857\u20131930), Vaudeville impresario * John Emory Andrus (1841\u20131934), mayor of Yonkers, New York, and U.S. Congressman * Peter Arno (1904\u20131968), cartoonist * Anne Bancroft (1931\u20132005), American actress * Wendy Barrie (1912\u20131978), actress * Ed Barrow (1868\u20131953), baseball manager and executive * Marion Bauer (1882\u20131955), American composer * Malcolm Lee Beggs (1907\u20131956) actor * Henri Bendel (1868\u20131936), fashion designer, creator of the Bendel bonnet * Vivian Blaine (1921\u20131995), actress and singer * William Blaisdell (1865\u20131931) Actor.
