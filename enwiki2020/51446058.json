    "text": "The Trident Society is an undergraduate secret society at Duke University. The Trident Society is rumored to have inherited the mission of The Order of the Red Friars and The Order of the White Duchy (the female version of the Friars). The Society seeks to give back to Duke University. ==History== The origin of the group remains shrouded in mystery. Frederick Wilson Neu claims to have been a member in 1934, whereas others believe the group came about in the wake of the dissolution of the Order of the Red Friars and Order of the White Duchy. Only recently has it come to light that \"TS\" stands for \"Trident Society.\" The men and women of the society maintain strict silence about their membership and the group's mission. A November 2007 edition of the Rival Magazine explained the group's philosophy. According to a \"cryptic letter sealed with wax,\" the society is \"rooted in ideals that stretch back to the university's founding.\" The letter continued: \"Our founders recognized that similar institutions existed at other top universities (Skull and Bones at Yale, The Sevens at the University of Virginia, Quill and Dagger at Cornell) and saw a void to fill at Duke.\" As such, on-campus members are not typically public about their membership in the Society, and do not join for recognition. Members of the society are or were recipients of the Rhodes Scholarship, Marshall Scholarship, Truman Scholarship, Angier B. Duke Scholarship, Benjamin Newton Duke Scholarship, players for Coach Mike Krzyzewski, and leaders of influential campus organizations. The secrecy around this group drove Samantha Lachman to investigate the society in the Duke Chronicle. Her subsequent article, \"Trasked with Secrecy,\" revealed information including the names of several prominent members, that the group places red roses and white carnations at the base of the James Buchanan Duke statue as their calling card, and that the group maintains uninhibited access to the Duke Chapel for their Initiation Rites. ==Activities== The Trident Society annually writes and frames a letter of recognition to select faculty and staff at the University who exceptionally impact the lives of students, maintains support for undergraduate scholarships, and makes philanthropic gifts. The organization also writes an annual letter, which is usually found on the steps of Lilly or Marketplace during the first few weeks of every school year, welcoming freshmen to the campus. Signs of the Trident Society appear frequently on Duke's campus, and such notes are sometimes accompanied by a rose.Kulshrestha, Ashwin (October 14, 2019). \"Chronquiry: What\u2019s up with all the weird guys in robes?

Before a 2015 restoration of the Duke University Chapel, the TS mark was integrated into a University plaque. ==References== ==External links== * November 2007 The Rival Magazine, November 2007 * Order of the White Duchy Records, 1925-1968 University Archives, Duke University * . * Glenn, \"Trident Society,\".
