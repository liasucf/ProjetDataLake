The cliffs serve as a tourist attraction in the area and they are privately owned. There is a fee to park. == Formation == The cliffs are made up of layers of silt and gravel that were formed during glacial erosion around two million years ago, and are part of the Hawkdun Group of sediments. The cliffs were uplifted by the nearby Ostler Fault. == References == Category:Tourist attractions in New Zealand Category:Cliffs of Oceania Category:Waitaki District Category:Rock formations of Canterbury, New Zealand ",
