Pell owned an island known as Pell Island (today known as Esopus Island), over a mile in length, in the middle of the Hudson River situated across his estate, and Overlook Mountain (near Woodstock), where he had built the Overlook Mountain House, which became a fashionable resort for summer tourists.
