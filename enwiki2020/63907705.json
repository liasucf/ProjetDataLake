    "text": "380px Narcissus at the Fountain is a 1500\u20131510 oil-on-panel painting by Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio, now in the Uffizi in Florence. A copy is now in the National Gallery, London. Both works show a young man in profile, interpreted as Narcissus due to his downward gaze. Strongly influenced by Leonardo da Vinci, particularly in the background, reminiscent of the Virgin of the Rocks), the work has several elements in common with other colleagues of Boltraffio such as Bernardino Luini and Andrea Solario, which in the past has caused attribution difficulties. ==References== category:1510 paintings Category:Paintings of the Uffizi category:Paintings depicting Greek myths category:Paintings by Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio ",
