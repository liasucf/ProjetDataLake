It is the mother church of the Diocese of Nottingham and seat of the Bishop of Nottingham. ==Location== It is located on the corner of Derby Road and North Circus Street, on the opposite side of which are the Albert Hall and the Nottingham Playhouse (Wellington Circus). ==History== The nave looking east The nave looking west The Blessed Sacrament Chapel It was built between 1841 and 1844, costing \u00a315,000 (equivalent to \u00a3 in ), and was first consecrated in 1844, fifteen years after the Catholic Relief Act ended most restrictions on Catholicism in the United Kingdom. A substantial amount of the cost was paid by the important Catholic Lord Shrewsbury. The architect was Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin who also designed the interior of The Houses of Parliament. It was built in the Early English Plain Gothic style, although in contrast, the Blessed Sacrament Chapel was richly decorated and Pugin's later churches were built in that Decorated Gothic style throughout. Pugin was retained as architect by Rev Robert William Willson, then priest in charge of Nottingham. In 1842 he was named as Bishop- Elect of Hobart, Tasmania, and had to leave the work in Nottingham before completion. Following the establishment of a new Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales in 1850 by the decree of Pope Pius IX, it was raised to cathedral status in 1852, becoming one of the first four Catholic cathedrals in England and Wales since the English Reformation.Decree of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, 21 April 1852. The other churches raised to cathedrals by this decree were St George's, Southwark, St Chad's, Birmingham and St John's, Salford: Decreta Quatuor Conciliorum Provincialium Westmonasteriensium, (2nd Edn, London: Burns & Oates), p.56; translation in: Robert Guy OSB, The Synods in English (Stratford-on-Avon: St Gregory Press, 1886) p.101. It is the seat of the Bishop of Nottingham. The cathedral is a Grade II* listed building of the lancet style of architecture, and is considered to be one of the best specimens of Pugin's work. Most of Pugin's decorative scheme was destroyed in the upheaval that surrounded the Second Vatican Council, when the old high altar was discarded, and most of the painted decoration smothered and painted plain. Other fittings removed at this time include the old cathedra, as well as the figures of St Mary and St John from the rood screen (the figures were reinstated in 1993). Buildings of England wrote: \u2018The whole effect could hardly be further from the richness of decoration and atmosphere that Pugin intended\u2019. A fragment of the scheme is preserved in the Blessed Sacrament chapel, and is the highlight of the interior. The replacement high altar from the 1960s was replaced again in 1993 with one in a more sympathetic style. Fragments of Pugin's decoration, such as the roundels in the nave, were uncovered and restored, but most remains lost. The clergy of the Cathedral also serve the church of St. Augustine on Woodborough Road. == Cathedral music == The organ The Chapel of Our Lady The Cathedral's choral scholarships are available to students above or of eighteen years of age who are in full-time tertiary education in the Nottingham area. ===List of Directors of Music=== *Edmund Hart Turpin 1850 \u2013 1865 *James Turpin 1866 \u2013 1873Nottinghamshire Guardian \u2013 Friday 1 August 1873 (afterwards organist of Londonderry Cathedral) *William George Taylor 1874 \u2013 1885History, Gazetteer & Directory of Nottinghamshire, 1885, p.445 \u2013 1898Wright's Directory of Nottingham, 1898\u201399, p.466 \u2013 1905 *William Francis Taylor 1905 \u2013 1963 Nottingham Cathedral Yesterday and Today, Edward Cocking et al. 2007 p.36 *Peter Smedley 1964 \u2013 2003 *Neil Page 2003 \u2013 2014 *Alex Patterson 2014 \u2013 2020. ===Assistant Directors of Music / Organists === *Peter Smedley 1954 \u2013 1964 *Christopher Burton 2008 \u2013 2010 *Paul Hayward 2011 \u2013 2012 *Alex Patterson 2012 \u2013 2014 *Eden Lavelle 2016 \u2013 2017 *Eleanor Martin 2019 \u2013 present ==References== ==External links== *St. Barnabas' Cathedral Official Website *Nottingham Cathedral Music Website *Diocese of Nottingham Official Website * Audio slideshow tour of St. Barnabas' from the BBC Nottingham Nottingham Category:Tourist attractions in Nottinghamshire Category:Buildings and structures in Nottinghamshire Category:Grade II* listed churches in Nottinghamshire Category:Grade II* listed cathedrals Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1844 Category:19th-century Roman Catholic church buildings in the United Kingdom Category:Roman Catholic Diocese of Nottingham Category:Grade II* listed Roman Catholic churches in England Category:Roman Catholic churches in Nottinghamshire Category:Augustus Pugin buildings ",
