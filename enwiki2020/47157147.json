Located on 89.7 MHz, XEOYE-FM is a pop-formatted radio station owned by NRM Comunicaciones and branded as Oye 89.7. ==History== Older Oye logo used when the station first began using the format XEOYE-FM is Mexico City's oldest surviving FM radio station, on air since August 28, 1957. It started its life as XEBS-FM, later switching callsigns with 100.9 FM to become XEOY-FM. It started with a classical music format, known as \"Est\u00e9reomil\", that remained on air for 39 years. The station was among the first in Mexico to operate regularly in stereo. After nearly four decades, on July 29, 1994, XEOY-FM became Morena F.M., an early ranchera and ballad music format. In 2000, NRM briefly allied with MVS Radio, which resulted in 89.7 FM taking on the FM Globo format when MVS's 104.9 FM became Exa FM; on July 15, 2002, this was ditched to become pop-formatted Oye 89.7. The station's callsign was changed to XEOYE-FM as part of the rebrand. ==References== Category:Radio stations in Mexico City Category:Radio stations established in 1957 Category:1957 establishments in Mexico ",
