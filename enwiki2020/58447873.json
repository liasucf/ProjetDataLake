She is a professor of computer science at the University of Colorado Boulder, where she specializes in nonlinear systems and nonlinear time series analysis. ==Rowing== Bradley competed in the women's coxed four event at the 1988 Summer Olympics, with rowers Jennifer Corbet, Cynthia Eckert, and Sarah Gengler, and coxswain Kim Santiago. Their boat placed fifth out of the ten boats competing in the event. She also competed in the 1986 World Rowing Championships, placing fourth in women's eights, and in the 1987 World Rowing Championships, placing fourth in women's pairs. ==Education and academic career== Bradley was a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1983, a master's degree in computer science in 1986, and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer science in 1992. Her dissertation, Taming Chaotic Circuits, was jointly supervised by Hal Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman. She joined the University of Colorado computer science department as an assistant professor in 1993, chaired the department from 2003 to 2006, and was promoted to full professor in 2004. She has also visited Harvard University, and was a Radcliffe fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study for 2006\u20132007. She was named a CRA-W Distinguished Professor by the Committee on Widening Participation in Computing Research in 2008, and was named a President\u2019s Teaching Scholar by the University of Colorado in 2017. ==References== ==External links== *Home page * Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:American female rowers Category:Olympic rowers of the United States Category:Rowers at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Sportspeople from New York City Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:21st-century American mathematicians Category:American women mathematicians Category:Applied mathematicians Category:Dynamical systems theorists Category:American computer scientists Category:American women computer scientists Category:University of Colorado Boulder faculty Category:Radcliffe fellows Category:20th-century American women scientists Category:21st-century American women scientists Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni ",
