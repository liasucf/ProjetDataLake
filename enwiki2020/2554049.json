    "text": "The Spanish Alarm was a period from 1739\u20131748 in North America during the War of Jenkins' Ear which was fought between Britain and Spain. The Spanish Government sanctioned forces to raid and pillage English port towns of the provinces of North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. Without an adequate regular military garrison in these provinces, the Kingdom of Great Britain encouraged the provinces to raise local militias to combat the Spanish-related attacks. ==Causes== Following the War of Spanish Succession Britain and Spain found themselves in a struggle for the balance of power which spilled into their respective colonial empires. This added to existing tensions of their disagreement as to the territorial boundaries of Georgia and Florida. Additionally Spain opposed English slave trafficking in the West Indies and its illegal lumbering on the Mosquito Coast of Central America. Britain disliked the Spanish Guarda-costas, the Spanish coastal police force, because of their harsh methods used to manage and inspect shipping in Spain. \"Hostilities between the rival settlements in Georgia and Florida were inevitable\". =='Alarm'== The southern frontier (South Carolina and Georgia) received British military support because of petitions from South Carolina, Oglethorpe, a British general, and the Trustees for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia in America. The British Government's comparative neglect and long deliberation however distressed the Trustees. In February 1737, Sir Robert Walpole wrote to Oglethorpe: > that he could form about 300 men capable of bearing arms in Georgia, that > South Carolina had money but no men, that North Carolina had men but no > money; that Pennsylvania had both, and Virginia only money. That New England > had men but no money, and New York had money and few men. It was in that year that British support finally began. British ships were posted on the coast, and Vice-Admiral Edward Vernon was dispatched to destroy Spanish settlements in the West Indies. In October 1739, Oglethorpe was instructed to attack St. Augustine, and colonial naval commissioners were instructed to assist. At the outbreak of the War of Jenkins' Ear, the Province of North Carolina raised four companies of one hundred men each to join other colonial troops in the siege of Cartagena in South America during 1741. In addition the colonies had to raise militias to defend their coastal towns and ports. Spanish attacks along the eastern seaboard were intended to disrupt shipping and loot port towns. These raids were continuous from 1741 to 1748 - the Spanish attacked Beaufort Town and Brunswick Town in 1747. In 1739, word had gotten out that there was a war between the British and the Spanish, and Carolina colonists were met with satisfaction. The mercantile community looked forward to getting rid of Spanish influence. > The time had arrived, South Carolinians believed, to remove once and for all > a galling Spanish influence which had incited rebellion among slaves, to > establish firm provincial boundaries and secure the Indian trade by pushing > back the frontier with Spanish Florida, and to realize profits from afar > which had objectives as much commercial as political. When the war had finally ended, however, South Carolinians were relieved; the war had not brought in much of the way of benefits. \"No sooner had the war begun than did Charleston merchants begin to consider methods by which they could gain from it\". The English colonists hoped to gain from the Spanish Alarm, but as the raids continued, the merchants realized their ill effects. Many colonists started to lose their enthusiasm, especially during the 1740s. The court, \"during nine years of actual warfare, recorded only twenty-one enemy ships which were captured by Charleston privateers and condemned as prizes of war\". The book Georgia Journeys stated that \"the Spanish Alarm...was of great damage to the colony in regarding cultivation\". ==Aftermath== The two nations settled some of their differences in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. This effectively halted the Spanish excursions into the English Americas. ==Sources== *Archives, North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources *The Colonial and State Records of North Carolina, Volume XXII *Sara Gober and Kenneth L.
