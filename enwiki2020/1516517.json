P. 51-52 The plan advocated avoiding direct engagement with French emperor, Napoleon I, which had resulted from fear of the emperor's now legendary prowess in battle. Consequently, the Allies planned to engage and defeat Napoleon's marshals and generals separately, and thus weaken his army while they built up an overwhelming force even he could not defeat. It was decided upon after a series of defeats and near disasters at the hands of Napoleon at L\u00fctzen, Bautzen and Dresden. The plan was successful, and at the Battle of Leipzig, where the Allies had a considerable numerical advantage, Napoleon was soundly defeated and driven out of Germany, back to the Rhine. The plan was an amalgam of two prior works: the Trachenberg Protocol and the Reichenbach Plan,Leggiere, Michael (2015). P. 52-60 authored by the Austrian chief of staff of the Sixth Coalition, Joseph Radetzky von Radetz and Crown Prince of Sweden Charles John (formerly Napoleon's marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte) whose experience with the tactics and methods of the Grande Arm\u00e9e, as well as personal insight on Napoleon, proved invaluable.Barton, Dunbar Plunkett (1930) P. 283-284 The combined, modified version of the two prior plans became known as the Trachenberg Plan.Leggiere, Michael (2015).
