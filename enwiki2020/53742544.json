    "text": "Cyphellae (singular: cyphella) are holes or crater-like pits found on the lower cortex of lichens of the genus Sticta. They look like smooth, whitish craters that open into the medulla layer and are lined with round, thin walled cells. Cyphellae are distinguished from pseudocyphellae by their larger size and by the presence of these specialized cells that surround the opening, which are absent in pseudocyphellae. The interior of the pore is typically white in color. == References == ==Additional sources== * McCune, B. and L. Geiser. 2009.
