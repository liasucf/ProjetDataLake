Then known as Riverdale Technical School, the facility was designed by the architect for the Board of Education, C.E.C. Dyson. In the nineteen-nineties it was extensively renovated but the original facade was maintained. On May 17, 2006, the first annual United Games were hosted at Riverdale. This was a day-long event also including students from Eastern Commerce, Monarch Park and DCTI. Former NBA star Jerome Williams acted as principal for the day. His activities included a presentation speaking out against violence,Reveille 2006, Pages 70\u201371 (School Yearbook) barbecuing lunch with students, and overseeing games designed to build relationships between the schools by forming teams with students from all four schools, rather than having a team for each school. Riverdale provides numerous sports teams and clubs throughout the year. Some big sports include field hockey, swim team, cross country, track and field, volleyball, basketball, soccer, ice hockey, and badminton. There are also many clubs including The Riverdale Athletic Association (RAA), Riverdale Raiders Robotics (R3P2), Riverdale Environmental Action League (R.E.A.L), Free the Children, Students Against Sexual Stereotype Discrimination (SASSD), and the Chinese Culture Club. Riverdale Collegiate celebrated its centennial on May 12, 2007. On February 10, 2015, it was reported that the TDSB was launching a review of schools for possible closure. Riverdale Collegiate Institute was incorrectly listed out of a possible seventy schools which the TDSB considers under-used and under review. Riverdale Collegiate Institute was over capacity at 103% at the time of the erroneous news reporting and was included as part of the Pupil Accommodation Review mandated by the Ministry of Education to ensure that \"school boards make more efficient use of school space while continuing to ensure that communities have the opportunity to provide meaningful input.\" ==Notable alumni== * Lincoln Alexander \u2013 first black Member of Parliament and 24th Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario * Carl Brewer \u2013 NHL defenseman * Morley Callaghan \u2013 writer * Megan Crewe \u2013 young adult writer * Punch Imlach \u2013 Hall of Fame ice hockey coach and general manager * Michael Ironside \u2013 actor * Gordon Sinclair \u2013 writer and TV personality * Ron Stewart \u2013 Canadian football league player *William Stuart McMullen - Second World War Pilot ==See also== *List of high schools in Ontario ==References== ==External links== * Riverdale Collegiate Institute Category:High schools in Toronto Category:Schools in the TDSB Category:Educational institutions established in 1907 Category:1907 establishments in Ontario ",
