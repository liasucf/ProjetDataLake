    "text": "Alejandro Javier Garc\u00eda Padilla (; born August 3, 1971) is a Puerto Rican politician and attorney who served as governor of Puerto Rico from 2013 to 2017. Prior to this position, Garc\u00eda Padilla held various roles in the political landscape of Puerto Rico; first as Secretary of Consumer Affairs, and then as a member of the 24th Senate of Puerto Rico and as president of the Popular Democratic Party. Locally, he is a staunch advocate for maintaining the current political status of Puerto Rico as that of an unincorporated territory of the United States with self-government, while at the national level he is allied with the Democratic Party. As governor, Garc\u00eda Padilla shared his legislative powers with the 25th Senate and 29th House of Representatives, both controlled by his party. Regardless of this, he was not able to persuade several members of his own party to support his proposals. This failure, in addition to his low popularity, ultimately led him to not seek re-election thus becoming the second governor in Puerto Rican history to not do so after their first term. ==Early years== Garc\u00eda Padilla was born on August 3, 1971 in Coamo, Puerto Rico to Luis Gerardo Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez (1927-2005) and Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles Padilla Passalacqua and is the youngest of six brothers including Juan Carlos and Antonio.Hon.

During his tenure at the agency, he was known for his credibility, accessibility and aggressive fiscalization. In 2007, Garc\u00eda Padilla resigned his position as Secretary and announced that he would run for Senator. In the 2008 general elections, he received the highest number of votes among all senatorial candidates. After the election, he was selected by Jos\u00e9 Dalmau Santiago, Senate Minority Leader, to serve as the ranking member on several committees, including Governmental Affairs, Public Safety, and Judicial Affairs. ===Gubernatorial campaign=== On March 6, 2011, Garc\u00eda Padilla announced his plans to run for Governor of Puerto Rico in 2012. He also announced his candidacy for President of the Popular Democratic Party, running unopposed, and took office on April 4, 2011. On October 26, 2011 he named Rafael Cox Alomar as his running mate for Resident Commissioner (who went on to lose the election by a 1.28% margin),http://div1.ceepur.org/REYDI_Escrutinio/index.html#es/default/COMISIONADO_RESIDENTE_ISLA.xml replacing H\u00e9ctor Ferrer R\u00edos, who withdrew from the congressional race in order to run as the PPD's candidate for Mayor of San Juan. ===2012 elections=== After the 2012 gubernatorial elections of November 6, 2012, Garc\u00eda Padilla was elected as the next Governor of Puerto Rico, by a narrow (0.6%) margin, defeating incumbent Luis Fortu\u00f1o 47.73% to 47.13%.http://div1.ceepur.org/REYDI_Escrutinio/index.html#es/default/GOBERNADOR_ISLA.xml ===Transition=== Puerto Rican law requires that a formal process is followed when the government must transition from one Governor to another. As such, Garc\u00eda Padilla formed the 2012 Incoming Committee on Government Transition composed of aides and advisors who would eventually become part of his Cabinet. ==Governorship== ===Inauguration=== Inauguration of Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla as the 11th Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico on the Capitol steps. Garc\u00eda Padilla was officially inaugurated as the 11th Governor of Puerto Rico on January 2, 2013 by Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, at an event held in the Puerto Rico Capitol.Garc\u00eda Padilla is the 11th Governor of Puerto Rico by ordinality but the 10th person to hold such post. This is because Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Col\u00f3n served two non-consecutive terms as 4th and 6th Governor of Puerto Rico. He will serve as governor concurrently with the 16th Cabinet of Puerto Rico and in parallel with the 17th Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico, the 25th Senate of Puerto Rico, and the 29th House of Representatives of Puerto Rico. ===First days=== Garc\u00eda Padilla formed a cabinet composed of former aides and members of the private sector to form the 16th Cabinet of Puerto Rico. He holds office in parallel with the 17th Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico, the 25th Senate of Puerto Rico, and the 29th House of Representatives of Puerto Rico. His primary challenge will be taking a government with a large indebtness and high deficit. His first executive orders were proclaimed on January 3, 2013, one day after being sworn in. One of them activated the Puerto Rico National Guard to monitor Puerto Rico's coasts and ports in order to reduce illegal immigration and the flow of illegal goods into the island, while another established that the Puerto Rico Chief of Staff must be consulted before making any appointments to empty seats, issuing contracts or amending existing contracts. The third executive order was proclaimed to control spending in agencies with credit cards, phones, escorts, official cars, overseas travel, and cell phones and personal digital assistants. ===Domestic policies=== On June 30, 2013, Garc\u00eda Padilla signed the Redistribution and Tax Charge Adjustment Act of 2013 () reducing the portion of the Puerto Rico Sales and Use Tax that municipalities charge from a 1.5% to 1.0%\u2014effectively lowering the total sales tax from 7.0% to 6.5%. However, this change has not yet been reflected, and the sales tax rate of 7.0% remains. The Act also expanded the use tax to include more services, including business-to-business sales and services like consulting. Under his administration, a new tax of 4 cents per liter was imposed on gasoline. As part of his economic policies, Garc\u00eda Padilla launched an austerity program, raising taxes by 1.1% of the gross national product (GNP) and making public employees\u2019 pension schemes less generous. These measures are expected to trim the government deficit from $2.2 billion to $800 million. This, according to The Economist, made 62% of Puerto Ricans disapprove of Garc\u00eda Padilla. On June 28, 2014, Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla signed into law the Puerto Rico Public Corporation Debt Enforcement and Recovery Act, which sought to allow corporations owned by the Commonwealth, such as the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority, and the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority to declare bankruptcy.Recent Legislation: Puerto Rico Passes New Municipal Reorganization Act, 128 Harv. L. Rev. 1320 (2015). However, in February 2015, U.S. District Judge Francisco Besosa found the Act was void because it was preempted by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.Franklin California Tax- Free Trust v. Puerto Rico, 85 F. Supp. 3d 577 (D.P.R. 2015). In July 2015, that ruling was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, with Judge Juan R.

II: Territorial Federalism, 130 Harv. L. Rev. 1632 (2017). ===Foreign policies=== In June 2013, Garc\u00eda Padilla traveled to Spain where he met with representatives of the pharmaceutical and medical devices industry of Spain to showcase Puerto Rico as an attractive investment destination. In July 2013, Garc\u00eda Padilla's administration established a trade agreement between Colombia and Puerto Rico whereby Colombia will import medicine from Puerto Rico and provide knowledge transfer in several industries. Puerto Rico on the other hand will co-manufacture products together with Colombia, so that Colombia can benefit from Puerto Rico's lack of tariffs when exporting to the United States. ==Public image and perception== On August 4, 2013, protesters marched in Old San Juan to express their discontent with new taxes imposed by his administration and the way the government has been handling its finances. On November 6, 2013, El Nuevo D\u00eda released poll results published a year after his election that indicated that 57% of poll participants rated Garc\u00eda- Padilla's administration with a \"D\" or an \"F\" grade and 62% disapproved of his performance as governor. He has also been accused of nepotism, because of his having five relatives working in the government, three of them as political appointees. Most of the criticism was focused on the appointment of his cousin, Ricardo Colon Padilla, as director of the commonwealth's Medicaid program, as Colon been previously convicted of providing the FBI and IRS with false testimony during an investigation. During a press conference in an agricultural area of Guanica, Garcia Padilla stated \"Mi ingl\u00e9s no es de New England (Nueva Inglaterra). Yo hablo ingl\u00e9s con acento de Coamo\" (My English is not from New England; I speak English with a Coamo accent)\" and added he is proud of his rural origins, that his English reflects said origin, and said \"Hablo mejor ingl\u00e9s que lo que habla cualquier americano el espa\u00f1ol\u201d (I speak better English than any American speaks Spanish).\" On December 14, 2015 after weeks of speculation and due to opposition from his own party, Garc\u00eda Padilla announced he wouldn't seek re-election. ==Personal life== Garc\u00eda Padilla married Wilma Pastrana, a CPA, on April 7, 2001.
