He appeared for his senior debut in a Primera B Nacional defeat to Gimnasia y Esgrima in March 2011, on the way to a total of eight appearances in the 2010\u201311 campaign as they finished eighteenth. In his 2011\u201312 opener versus Ferro Carril Oeste on 11 September 2011, Alvacete scored his first goal in a 3\u20130 victory at the Estadio Bautista Gargantini. Goals against Gimnasia y Esgrima, Defensa y Justicia and Crucero del Norte came in two further seasons as he featured fifty-seven times for them.
