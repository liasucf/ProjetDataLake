    "text": "Insignia of the society The Society of SS. Peter and Paul was an English Anglo-Catholic publishing company in the Anglican Papalist tradition. It was established in 1911 as a reaction to the works of the Anglican priest and liturgist Percy Dearmer, particularly The Parson's Handbook, which advocated a liturgical style distinct to England and rooted in the Sarum rite. The society believed that the church should follow the liturgical development of the European continental church and remain faithful to the Roman Rite used by Rome, and that the best means to accomplish this was to produce missals and other prayer books for this liturgical tradition. The society worked closely with the illustrator Martin Travers to produce the desired aesthetic for this movement. The society was responsible for the creation of the Anglican Missal, a liturgical book still used by some Anglo-Catholics and other high-church Anglicans as a supplement to the Book of Common Prayer. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Anglo-Catholicism Category:Book publishing companies of the United Kingdom Category:Christian publishing companies ",
