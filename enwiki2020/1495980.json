    "text": "\"Connection\" is a song released by the Britpop group Elastica. It was originally released in 1994 as a single and the album version was not released until 1995 on their self-titled debut. The song debuted and peaked at number 17 on the UK Singles Chart and became one of the few Britpop songs to gain popularity in North America, reaching number 53 on the US Billboard Hot 100, number two on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, and number nine on the Canadian RPM Top Singles chart. The song was the subject of controversy, due to its overt similarity to another band's work. The intro synthesizer part (later repeated as a guitar figure) is lifted from the guitar riff in Wire's \"Three Girl Rhumba\" and transposed down a semitone. A judgment resulted in an out-of-court settlement and the credits were rewritten. Jonathan Perry writing for The Phoenix noted the similarities to Wire. He included the song in a list of the 90 best songs of the 90s, writing: Connection', Elastica's obsessively catchy stateside breakthrough, nicked its signature opening riff from Wire's 'Three Girl Rhumba' \u2013 an overzealous (and uncredited) 'homage' that proved that though imitation may indeed be the highest form of flattery, it can also cost in publishing royalties. Great song, though.\" The song is the theme to the UK television programme Trigger Happy TV. A live version of the song was featured on the MuchMusic live compilation album, Much at Edgefest '99. The song also appears in the 2019 Marvel Cinematic Universe film, Captain Marvel, which is set in June 1995. ==Track listing== UK CD & 12\" single # \"Connection\" # \"See That Animal\" # \"Blue\" (Donna's 4-Track Demo) # \"Spastica\" EU & AUS CD single # \"Connection\" # \"Rockunroll\" (Peel Session) # \"Annie\" (Peel Session) # \"See That Animal\" ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" !Chart (1994\u20131995) !Peak Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA) N.B.
