    "text": "Bow Valley was a provincial electoral district in Alberta, Canada, mandated to return a single member to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1913 to 1940, and again from 1971 to 1997. ==History== The Bow Valley electoral district was formed in 1913 from the Gleichen and Lethbridge District electoral districts. Bow Valley would be abolished prior to the 1940 Alberta general election, primarily forming Bow Valley-Empress electoral district, and a small portion added to Edson electoral district. Bow Valley was revived in the 1970 electoral district re-distribution from the Bow Valley-Empress electoral district. In the 1996 electoral district re-distribution, the Bow Valley electoral district was abolished and the territory was divided among Strathmore-Brooks, Drumheller-Chinook and Cypress-Medicine Hat electoral districts. The Electoral Boundaries Commission drafted the report with the intention of the Strathmore-Brooks electoral district retaining the name \"Bow Valley\". ===Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs)=== The 1926 Alberta general election would be the first held under single transferable vote in rural districts. Liberal leader Joseph Tweed Shaw would come second in the first count to United Farmers of Alberta candidate Ben S. Plumer. However, on the count of transferable votes Shaw would win the district by one vote. ==Election results== ===1913 general election=== ===1913 by-election=== ===1917 general election=== ===1921 general election=== ===1926 general election=== ===1930 general election=== ===1935 general election=== ===1971 general election=== ===1975 general election=== ===1979 general election=== ===1982 general election=== ===1986 general election=== ===1989 general election=== ===1993 general election=== ==See also== *Alberta provincial electoral districts ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== *Elections Alberta *The Legislative Assembly of Alberta Category:Former Alberta provincial electoral districts ",
