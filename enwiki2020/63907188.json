The battery was proposed in 1885 on the recommendations of the Stanhope Committee report and completed in 1887.The National Archives WO78/4259, Plymouth, Sub District. Maker Battery: plans, sections, etc. 1899 It was built with emplacements for a single 12.5-inch Rifled Muzzle Loading (RML) gun which was mounted. It was then supplemented in 1890 when two further 12.5-inch guns were moved from nearby Grenville Battery.The National Archives WO196/31, Ports and harbours Western District: Revision of Coast defence armaments prior to June 1894 The gun positions were served by underground magazines. The rear of the battery is enclosed by a small ditch and drawbridge. There was no barrack accommodation at the battery, but a small cookhouse was built to cater for the men expected to man the battery. The battery was upgraded with newer armament in 1899 when the battery was re-modelled for two 6-inch breech loading (BL) guns which were installed by 1903. These remained in place until 1911 when they were dismounted. The battery was abandoned by the War Office in 1948. The battery remains complete but derelict today. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * ==External links== * Victorian Forts data sheet Category:Forts of Plymouth Category:Military history of Cornwall ",
