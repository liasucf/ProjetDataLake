Bi incorporated the actors' real lives when developing their characters. The lead character Chen Sheng is portrayed by Bi's uncle Chen Yongzhong, who like the character is a former gangster. Bi primarily filmed Kaili Blues in his hometown of Kaili City. The scenes in Dangmai were shot in the nearby village of Ping Liang. The film's budget was exhausted after completing the 41-minute long take of Dangmai. To finish the film, Bi assembled a small team to shoot the rest of the film using a portable Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera. Bi originally proposed the title Huang ran lu, after Portuguese author Fernando Pessoa's novel The Book of Disquiet. However, it was rejected as being too downbeat. The film's Chinese title comes from the Strugatsky brothers' novel Roadside Picnic, which Tarkovsky adapted into the 1979 film Stalker. ==Release== Kaili Blues premiered on August 11, 2015 at the 68th Locarno Festival. During its opening weekend, it grossed 4.49 million yuan. It went on to gross 6.46 million yuan in China. The film won the Best Emerging Director prize at Locarno, the Best New Film Director award at the 52nd Golden Horse Awards. and the Golden Montgolfiere Prize at the 37th Three Continents Festival in Nantes. ==References== ==External links== * Kaili Blues at Grasshopper Film * * * * Category:Chinese films Category:Films directed by Bi Gan Category:Films shot in Guizhou ",
