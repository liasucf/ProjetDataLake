    "text": "In mathematics, the inflation-restriction exact sequence is an exact sequence occurring in group cohomology and is a special case of the five-term exact sequence arising from the study of spectral sequences. Specifically, let G be a group, N a normal subgroup, and A an abelian group which is equipped with an action of G, i.e., a homomorphism from G to the automorphism group of A. The quotient group G/N acts on ::AN = { a \u2208 A : na = a for all n \u2208 N}. : Then the inflation-restriction exact sequence is: ::0 -> H 1(G/N, AN) -> H 1(G, A) -> H 1(N, A)G/N -> H 2(G/N, AN) ->H 2(G, A) : In this sequence, there are maps * inflation H 1(G/N, AN) \u2192 H 1(G, A) * restriction H 1(G, A) \u2192 H 1(N, A)G/N * transgression H 1(N, A)G/N \u2192 H 2(G/N, AN) * inflation H 2(G/N, AN) \u2192H 2(G, A) The inflation and restriction are defined for general n: * inflation Hn(G/N, AN) \u2192 Hn(G, A) * restriction Hn(G, A) \u2192 Hn(N, A)G/N The transgression is defined for general n * transgression Hn(N, A)G/N \u2192 Hn+1(G/N, AN) only if Hi(N, A)G/N = 0 for i \u2264 n \u2212 1.Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.67 The sequence for general n may be deduced from the case n = 1 by dimension-shifting or from the Lyndon\u2013Hochschild\u2013Serre spectral sequence.Gille & Szamuely (2006) p. 68 ==References== * * * * * * Category:Homological algebra ",
