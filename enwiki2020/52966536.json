In 2014 they released the EP Charm City (after the nickname of Baltimore). In 2015 their eponymous song was selected for the closing credits of the movie Spy starring Melissa McCarthy. They also released an EP in May 2015 called A Place Called Home, working with Drew Fulk. In 2016 the band toured with the Warped Tour of 2016. A debut album called Awake in Color was released in late 2016.
