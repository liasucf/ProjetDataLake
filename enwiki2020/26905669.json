    "text": "The Swedish Winter Grand Prix was a race held on the ice of frozen lakes, similar to races held in Estonia, Finland and Norway. The 1930s also saw the Swedish Summer Grand Prix, which can be seen as a predecessor of the Swedish Grand Prix, which was a round of the Formula One World Championship from 1973 to 1978. ==History== ===Pre-war=== While racing in Sweden had a long history it was not until 1931 that a race was first titled Grand Prix. The first Swedish Winter Grand Prix was held on a mammoth 46 kilometre circuit near Lake R\u00e4men, with a lap time of approximately 35 minutes. In an entry that included Rudolf Caracciola, the race was claimed by Finnish Mercedes racer Karl Ebb in the first Grand Prix victory of his ice racing career. Sven Olaf Bennstr\u00f6m won the second race the following year with Per-Viktor Widengren winning the third race in an Alfa Romeo monoposto. Later the same year the first Swedish Summer Grand Prix was held on a 30 kilometre circuit at Norra Vram. The Winter Grand Prix was held again in 1936 with Eugen Bj\u00f8rnstad claiming another monoposto Alfa Romeo victory but the huge crowds of the earlier years did not return and the Winter Grand Prix was not held again until after the war in 1947. ===Post- war=== The 1947 race was held on a circuit surrounding a Swedish Air Force site at Rommehed. It is highly probable that this race was run to Formula 1 rules and was thus the first Formula 1 race. Only four cars started and three finished, all visiting British ERAs, after the ship carrying the bulk of the grid was not able to make its destination. == Winners of the Swedish Winter Grand Prix == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |- !
