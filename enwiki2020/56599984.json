As a result, this species has been referred to as Tinea (s.l.) aetherea. This species is endemic to New Zealand. The wingspan is 9\u201310 mm. The forewings are purplish fuscous with grey-ochreous markings. The hindwings are purplish grey with a dark-fuscous subbasal shade. ==References== ==External links== *Image of type specimen of Tinea s.l. aetherea.
