Ashgate Publishing Limited (2003) , S.122 ff. The 270 articles he wrote for the Encyclop\u00e9die by Denis Diderot and d\u2019Alembert are the only texts we know of him. There were more than 150 articles for Volume I and about 100 for Volume II ; his sudden death interrupted his cooperation for the relevant sections of Volume III for which he could contribute only one article. After the death of Vandenesse, Diderot needed a new author in the field of medicine and pharmacy. On the recommendation of Gabriel Fran\u00e7ois Venel, he chose Arnulphe d'Aumont. == References == == Bibliography == * Frank Arthur Kafker: The Encyclopedists as individuals: a biographical dictionary of the authors of the Encyclop\u00e9die, Oxford 1988, == External links == * Urbain de Vandenesse on Wikisource * Vandenesse, Urbain de on IdRef * P\u00e9diatrie des lumi\u00e8res: maladies et soins des enfants dans l'Encyclop\u00e9die Category:18th- century French physicians Category:Contributors to the Encyclop\u00e9die (1751\u20131772) Category:1753 deaths ",
