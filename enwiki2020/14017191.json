    "text": "The water source for the city of Troy, New York is the Tomhannock Reservoir, a man-made reservoir northeast of Troy in the town of Pittstown. The reservoir is long, and holds when full. Water quality is good to excellent.Troy NY Water Department reports Retrieved 2011-08-05. Licensed fishing (both warm-weather and ice fishing) is a popular recreational activity.Tomhannock Reservoir fishing information Retrieved 2011-08-05. ==History== Construction of the reservoir began in 1900 as a successor to the Oakwood, Brunswick and Lansingburgh Reservoirs, and it was placed into service in 1906. After eight years of repairs to the original main, a supplemental main was installed to stabilize the city's water supply. Facilities for chlorination, metering and the addition of lime to the water were added in 1952. In 1960, a study determined that the Tomhannock Reservoir could serve the city of Troy and the region immediately adjacent to the city (East Greenbush, North Greenbush, Brunswick, a portion of Schaghticoke, and West Sand Lake) in southern Rensselaer County. During the early 1960s a treatment plant was constructed, which provided filtration and additional supplementation with alum, carbon, potassium permanganate and fluoride.Chris Alonge, \"History of Troy NY Water Supplies\" (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) Retrieved 2011-08-05. ==References== Category:Reservoirs in New York (state) Category:Protected areas of Rensselaer County, New York Category:Reservoirs in Rensselaer County, New York ",
