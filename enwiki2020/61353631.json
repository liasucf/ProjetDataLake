Greenfield was largely distraught by the breakup; he neverless decided to write \"Our Last Song Together\" and \"Love Will Keep Us Together\" as their last songs. from Sedaka's official YouTube channel ==Cover versions== The first cover of \"Our Last Song Together\" was recorded by Euson in 1973. In 1975, two covers of \"Our Last Song Together\" charted in the U.S.: Bobby Sherman on the Easy Listening chart and Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods on the Pop chart. Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog (ABBA) recorded a Swedish cover version in 1973, \"Vi har hunnit fram till refr\u00e4ngen\" as the B-Side to her solo single, \"En s\u00e5ng om sorg och gl\u00e4dje\" which reached #1 on the Swedish charts in 1973. Both songs were included on her 1973 album, Agnetha F\u00e4ltskogs b\u00e4sta .
