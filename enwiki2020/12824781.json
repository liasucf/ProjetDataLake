Because it was developed for travelers going to Zenk\u014d-ji, it was also called Zenk\u014d-ji Kaid\u014d (\u5584\u5149\u5bfa\u8857\u9053). It stretched from the Nakasend\u014d's Oiwake-juku to the Hokurikud\u014d's Takada-shuku. Nowadays, the route is traced by Route 18, stretching between the town of Karuizawa and the city of J\u014detsu. Although it ranked below the five major routes, the Hokkoku Kaid\u014d was an important link between the Kant\u014d region and the Sea of Japan side of Honshu. It carried marine products and gold from the mines on Sado. Daimy\u014d from the Hokuriku region travelled it on their sankin k\u014dtai journeys between their domains and Edo. ==Stations of the Hokkoku Kaid\u014d== Though there were 25 post stations along the Hokkoku Kaid\u014d, some of the stations were .Aijuku: Two or more inns that operated alternately, in areas where there was not enough traffic to support a full-time station.
