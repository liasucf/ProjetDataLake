    "text": "Henry D. Phillips. The 1904 College Football All-Southern Team consists of American football players selected to the College Football All-Southern Teams selected by various organizations for the 1904 Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association football season. In Dan McGugin and Mike Donahue's first year as head coach, Vanderbilt and Auburn shared the SIAA championship, challenging John Heisman's eminence in the South. ==Composite eleven== Lob Brown. The composite eleven included: *Jones Beene, end for Tennessee. He once coached the Chattanooga Mocs and was also the first coach of the Tennessee Wesleyan Bulldogs. *Innis Brown, guard for Vanderbilt. He was also a Rhodes Scholar. Brown was later a referee who often commented on the sport, picking the Constitution's All-Southern team in 1912. *Lob Brown, tackle for Georgia Tech. Some publications claim he was Tech's first All-Southern player, while others claim Jesse Thrash. *Honus Craig, halfback for Vanderbilt. Dan McGugin once called him the South's greatest athlete and Vanderbilt's greatest halfback. *Puss Derrick, tackle for Clemson. He was captain-elect, \"and he has learned to run the ball\" wrote former coach Heisman. *Humphrey Foy, fullback for Auburn, the undefeated school's lone selection in Mike Donahue's first year. He was injured the year prior. *Ed Hamilton, end for Vanderbilt. He coached Vanderbilt basketball in 1903-1904 and 1908-1909\\. *Henry D. Phillips, guard for Sewanee, unanimous selection. Sportswriter Fuzzy Woodruff called him \"the greatest football player who ever sank cleated shoes into a chalk line south of the Mason-Dixon line.\" *John Scarbrough, quarterback for Sewanee, unanimous selection. On the dedication of Harris Stadium, one writer noted \"The University of the South has numbered among its athletes some of the greatest. Anyone who played against giant Henry Phillips in 1901-1903 felt that he was nothing less than the best as guard and fullback. Anyone who ever saw a punt from the foot of J. W. Scarbrough.\" *Willard Steele, halfback for Cumberland, made All-Southern in his first year on the varsity. He was a physician who specialized in diseases of the eye, ear, nose, and throat. *Stein Stone, center for Vanderbilt. He was selected for the Associated Press Southeast Area All-Time football team 1869-1919 era. ==Composite overview== Henry D.
