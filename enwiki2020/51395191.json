Most notably he became known as co-founder of the School of Vallecas, together with the sculptor Alberto S\u00e1nchez P\u00e9rez. The quintessence of the large body of his work is perhaps the poetry of the Castilian landscape as defined by the Generation of '98. ==References== ==External links== *Website of the artist *Artist's profile on artnet.com Category:Abstract painters Category:Spanish surrealist artists Category:Modern painters Category:1894 births Category:1980 deaths Category:20th-century Spanish painters Category:Spanish male painters Category:Spanish language ",
