    "text": "The 1890 Quebec general election was held on June 17, 1890 to elect members of the 7th Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent Quebec Liberal Party Parti national coalition led by Honor\u00e9 Mercier, was re- elected, defeating the Quebec Conservative Party, led by Louis-Olivier Taillon. A scandal and charges of corruption cut short Mercier's term of office. He was later cleared of all charges, but his political career was ended. ==Results== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\" |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" !rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party !rowspan=\"2\"|Party Leader !rowspan=\"2\"|# of candidates !colspan=\"3\"|Seats !colspan=\"3\"|Popular Vote |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" |align=\"center\"|1886 |align=\"center\"|Elected |align=\"center\"|% Change |align=\"center\"|# |align=\"center\"|% |align=\"center\"|% Change | Honor\u00e9 Mercier |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|33 !align=\"right\"|43 |align=\"right\"|+30.3% |align=\"right\"|70,345 |align=\"right\"| 44.54% |align=\"right\"|+5.0% | Louis- Olivier Taillon |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| 26 !align=\"right\"| 23 |align=\"right\"| -11.5% |align=\"right\"|71,695 |align=\"right\"| 45.39% |align=\"right\"| -0.8% |colspan=2|Independent Conservative |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|3 !align=\"right\"|1 |align=\"right\"|-66.7% |rowspan=4 align=\"right\"|15,888 |rowspan=4 align=\"right\"| 10.06% |rowspan=4 align=\"right\"|-3.6% |Parti national | |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|3 !align=\"right\"|5 |align=\"right\"|+66.7% |Parti ouvrier | |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|- !align=\"right\"|1 |align=\"right\"| |colspan=2|Other |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|- !align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"|- |- |colspan=\"3\"|Total !align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|65 !align=\"right\"|73 !align=\"right\"|- !align=\"right\"|157,928 !align=\"right\"|100% |align=\"right\"| |- |} ==See also== * List of Quebec premiers * Politics of Quebec * Timeline of Quebec history * List of Quebec political parties * 7th Legislative Assembly of Quebec ==References== Quebec general election Category:Elections in Quebec General election Quebec general election ",
