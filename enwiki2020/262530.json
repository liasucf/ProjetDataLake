    "text": "The Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies (; literally River of the Prairies, sometimes called the Back River in English) is a delta channel of the Ottawa River in southwestern Quebec, Canada. The indigenous inhabitants of what's now known as the Island of Montreal called it Skowanoti, meaning \"River behind the island\". ==Geography== Flowing west to east, the Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies bisects the Hochelaga Archipelago and originates in the Lake of Two Mountains. It flows on either side of \u00cele Bizard (part of Montreal), then divides the Island of Montreal (Montreal) to the south from \u00cele J\u00e9sus (Laval) to the north, after which it flows into the St. Lawrence River at the eastern tip of the Island of Montreal. The river contains a large number of islands, including \u00cele Bizard, the \u00celes Laval (\u00cele Bigras, \u00cele Pariseau, \u00cele Verte and \u00cele Ronde) belonging to Laval, and \u00cele de la Visitation, a nature park belonging to Montreal. There are also islands named \u00cele Mercier, \u00cele M\u00e9nard, \u00cele Jasmin, \u00cele Barwick, \u00cele de Roxboro, \u00cele aux Chats, \u00cele Paton, \u00cele Perry, \u00cele Lapierre, \u00cele Boutin, \u00cele Rochon and \u00cele Gagn\u00e9. The Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies has many rapids. Rapids are shown in several places on the 1879 map of Henry Whitmersome Hopkins, and on Gordon and Gotch's map of the Island of Montreal from 1924. Named rapids of the river, starting from the west, are the \"Rapides de Cap-Saint- Jacques\",Commission de toponymie Qu\u00e9bec Rapides de Cap-Saint-Jacques the Lalemant(Dutchman) RapidsDutchman rapids 45'32 73'51 that are located between \u00cele Bizard and Laval (with a ferry),Map of Rapides Lalemant, Quebec , Rapids - Canada Geographical Names with Maps the \"Rapides du Cheval Blanc\"(Whitehorse rapids) that are located in between the borough of Pierrefonds-Roxboro and Sainte-Doroth\u00e9e,Les rapides du Cheval Blanc 1968-12-05 the Laval rapids, the \"Sault-au-R\u00e9collet Rapids\"Map of Rapides du Sault au R\u00e9collet, Quebec , Rapids - Canada Geographical Names with Maps that are located north of Bordeaux Prison, and ending with the \"Rapides de la Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies\".Map of Rapides de la Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies, Quebec , Rapids - Canada Geographical Names with Maps The riverfront in the West Island area was famous for its beaches along the river.

Whenever there is significant rainfall on the island of Montreal, household sewage is mixed with the city street rainwater and discharged untreated into the river. This sewage turns the river into essentially an open sewer. The sewage problem was reported in the year 1911., and a need to purify Montreal sewage in 1935. Editorial Cartoon of Riviere des prairies water pollution. North Shore News. August 15th 1968. The Montreal Board of Trade (BOT) commissioned a report on the water pollution in the late 1950s, and the report was given to Premier Barrette.\"Montreal Worst Offender in Water Pollution\" The Montreal Gazette. February 26, 1960. Montreal has six drinking-water plants on the Island whose source of water is the Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies and Lac Saint Louis. Reportedly, Montreal and Quebec city drinking water is tested.\"Montreal, Quebec City drinking water tests satisfactory: experts\" CBC news June 17, 2015 It is claimed modern sewage treatment techniques have reversed much of the damage from the sewage.The Montreal Gazette \"2.95 billion litres dumped daily\" March 29, 1984 Some people consider the river clean again, starting in the year 1998, when most of the sewage was treated before being discharged.A History of Problems Under Montreal However, parts of the river are never suitable for swimming .

The Rive-Bois\u00e9e problem had been noticed and was reported to be repaired in 2014.Title \"Pierrefonds tackles 133 cases of cross-connected pipes\" Montreal Gazette, Cheryl Cornacchia, November 19, 2013 The reason for the sewage problem is that the storm sewer drain system and the sanitary sewer system were mistakenly connected in many places, and it takes money to correct and repair.Title \"Beaconsfield wins cross- connected pipes court case brought forward by homeowner\" Montreal Gazette, March 5, 2014 Reports from the R.S.M.A.(R\u00e9seau de suivi du milieu aquatique) dated 2015 on the water quality of RDP-140 indicate the problem has not been fixed. From Bing maps, many of the sewage output locations can be seen on the river shoreline. The solution to the visible pollution (plastic bags, toilet paper, condoms) that accumulates on the shoreline is to use a type of a screen at all the storm drains and outlets that expel the rainwater-garbage mixture into the river. ==See also== * Fecal-oral route Diseases that can be transmitted from feces in water. * Hochelaga Archipelago * List of bridges spanning the Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies * List of crossings of the Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies * List of hydroelectric stations * List of Quebec rivers * Saint Lawrence Seaway ==References== ==External links== * RSMA.
