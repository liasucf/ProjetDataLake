It was established in 1973 and is based in Bethesda, Maryland. ==History== The National Foundation for Infectious Diseases originated at the Medical College of Virginia's Infectious Disease Division. In early 1973, several individuals there had the idea of creating a non-governmental organization to raise awareness of, and help develop treatments for, infectious diseases. Later that year, the NFID was created, originally as a non-profit corporation based in Virginia. The original founders of the NFID included John P. Utz and Richard J. Duma, who served as the organization's first and second president, respectively. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Organizations established in 1973 Category:501(c)(3) organizations Category:Organizations based in Maryland Category:1973 establishments in Virginia Category:Infectious disease organizations Category:Medical and health foundations in the United States ",
