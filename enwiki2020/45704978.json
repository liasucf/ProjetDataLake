He became editor of the journal The Practical Engineer in 1891, which led to him starting the Scientific Publishing Company in 1898. That year, his journal The Mechanical Engineer published the design of a circular calculator operated by moving fixed pointers over a revolving dial. In 1908, Fowler's son, Harold, began commercial production of circular calculators in Sale, using the same design with the calculator's appearance and control resembling that of a pocket watch. After Harold Fowler's retirement, the company was run by Jim Cookson, and closed in 1988 following his retirement. ==References== ==External links== * Collection of Fowler Calculators Category:Defunct manufacturing companies of the United Kingdom Category:Manufacturing companies based in Manchester Category:Defunct companies based in Manchester ",
