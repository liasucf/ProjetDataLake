    "text": "The Great Unknown is the third solo studio album by the Matchbox Twenty lead singer Rob Thomas, released on August 21, 2015, through Atlantic Records. Its lead single, \"Trust You\", premiered on Entertainment Weekly's website on May 29, 2015. == Critical reception == The Great Unknown received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 69 based on 4 reviews. In a positive review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the record as, \"an album that deliberately side-steps many of Thomas' signature moves while still sounding unmistakably like him.\" The Boston Globe's Sarah Rodman wrote that on The Great Unknown, the singer continues his career of composing, \"catchy melodies, lyrics straightforward in their universality, and crisp production\". According to her, \"Thomas is either becoming a stronger, more nuanced singer or continuing to learn how to write in a way that more effectively displays the various facets of his voice.\" In a more mixed review, Chuck Arnold of Rolling Stone wrote, \"Rob Thomas remains a known quantity on his third solo album. While that means there aren't many surprises, the good news is he's still the same consummate pop-rock craftsman who has been making it all sound so smooth for years.\" Jim Farber of New York Daily News was more critical towards the album's composition and lyrics: \"The songs offer few individualized lyrical details, and no consistent themes, to pin on a particular person. The arrangements, likewise, have a slick adaptability that makes these songs serviceable cover material for any pop star of the hour.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Aidean Abounasseri \u2013 acoustic guitar, electric guitar * Alex Arias \u2013 beat box, drum programming, synthesizer * Yonatan Ayal \u2013 drum programming * Glenn Berger \u2013 tenor saxophone * Ruth Ann-Cunningham \u2013 background vocals * Ryan Dragon \u2013 trombone * Christian Dugas \u2013 background vocals * Sarah Dugas \u2013 background vocals * Laurence Fishburne \u2013 background vocals * Shep Goodman \u2013 drum programming, acoustic guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, background vocals * La Tanya Hall \u2013 background vocals * James Hovorka \u2013 trumpet * Victor Indrizzo \u2013 drums, percussion * Bunny Knutson \u2013 choir * Jason Lader \u2013 bass guitar, acoustic guitar, keyboards, modulator, piano, drum programming, synthesizer strings, synthesizer * Adam MacDougal \u2013 keyboards * Ray Parker Jr. \u2013 electric guitar * Brent Paschke \u2013 bass guitar, drum programming, synthesizer * Tim Pierce \u2013 electric guitar * Ricky Reed \u2013 drum programming * Elijah Samuels \u2013 baritone saxophone * Matt Serletic \u2013 bass guitar, bells, choir, Fender Rhodes, horn arrangements, keyboards, organ, percussion, piano, drum programming, string arrangements, synthesizer strings, synthesizer, background vocals * Ryan Tedder \u2013 drums, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, keyboards, drum programming, background vocals * Rob Thomas \u2013 piano, drum programming, shaker, lead vocals, background vocals * Lee Thornburg \u2013 trumpet * Patrick Woodward \u2013 choir * Lyle Workman \u2013 electric guitar * Noel Zancanella \u2013 bass guitar, drums, keyboards, drum programming ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !
