His playing style (usually getting away from the goal area) made Alumni's captain Jorge Brown told him off several times. He is considered a predecessor of other goalkeepers such as Ubaldo Fillol or Hugo Gatti. Buruca started his career playing for Central Athletic Club, then moving to Barracas A.C. where he stayed until 1904.
