    "text": "Grevillea rudis is a shrub of the genus Grevillea native to an area along the west coast in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia. The loose, spreading to erect shrub typically grows to a height of and has non-glaucous branchlets. It has simple flat, spathulate, irregularly lobed leaves with a blade that is long and wide. It blooms sporadically throughout the year and produces a terminal raceme regular inflorescence with cream or yellow flowers and white or cream styles. Later it forms obovoid or ellipsoidal glandular hairy fruit that is long. It will regenerate from seed only. It is similar to Grevillea althoferorum but with more deeply divided leaves and with fewer-flowered conflorescences. G. rudis is found amongst medium to low trees or on heathland. It grows in gravelly, sandy or loamy soils, in an area between Eneabba to Jurien Bay and inland to Watheroo. It was first described by Carl Meisner in 1855 in Hooker's Journal of Botany and Kew Garden Miscellany Volume 7. In 1995 it was recognised as 'Rare' in J.D.Briggs & J.H.Leighs Rare or Threatened Australian Plants. ==See also== * List of Grevillea species ==References== rudis Category:Endemic flora of Western Australia Category:Eudicots of Western Australia Category:Proteales of Australia Category:Taxa named by Carl Meissner ",
