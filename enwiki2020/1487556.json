    "text": "San Francisco from the Presidio, 1966 San Francisco, in the US state of California, has both major, well-known neighborhoods and districts as well as smaller, specific subsections and developments. While there is considerable fluidity among the sources, one guidebook identifies five major districts, corresponding to the four quadrants plus a south central district. These five broad districts, counterclockwise are: Central/downtown, Richmond, Sunset, Upper Market and beyond (south central) and Bernal Heights/Bayview and beyond (southeast). Within each of these five districts are located major neighborhoods, and again there is considerable fluidity seen in the sources. The San Francisco Planning Department officially identifies 36 neighborhoods. Within these 36 official neighborhoods are a large number of minor districts, some of which are historical, and some of which are overlapping. ==Alamo Square== Alamo Square is a subset of the Western Addition neighborhood. Its boundaries are not well-defined, but are generally considered to be Webster Street on the east, Golden Gate Avenue on the north, Divisadero Street on the west, and Oak Street on the south. It is characterized by Victorian architecture that was left largely untouched by the urban renewal projects in other parts of the Western Addition. On a clear day, the Transamerica Pyramid building and the tops of the Golden Gate Bridge and Bay Bridge can be seen from the park's center. San Francisco's City Hall can be seen directly down Fulton Street. A row of Victorian houses facing the park on Steiner Street, known as the painted ladies, are often shown in the foreground of panoramic pictures of the city's downtown area. ==Anza Vista== ==Ashbury Heights== Ashbury Heights is a neighborhood on the hill to the south of the Haight- Ashbury neighborhood. It is at the base of Tank Hill and neighboring Cole Valley. ==Balboa Park== ==Balboa Terrace== Balboa Terrace is a small residential neighborhood in southwestern San Francisco bounded by Junipero Serra Boulevard, Monterey Avenue, Aptos Avenue and Ocean Avenue along the southern edge of the exclusive St. Francis Wood development. ==Bayview== The Bayview stretches along Third Street south of Evans Avenue, west of the Hunters Point neighborhood. The neighborhood library was recently renamed the Linda Brooks-Burton Branch Library after a new and larger building was constructed at the same location on Third Street and Revere. Within a block or two of the library are three urban gardens and public art projects, developed entirely by residents, known as the Quesada Gardens Initiative (the Quesada Garden, Bridgeview Garden, and Latona Garden). The Bayview is known for its friendly and diverse residents, warm weather and inviting vistas, community gardens, independent businesses, artists' community, and rich history as an African American and working-class neighborhood. During the 1950s it was largely an Italian and Maltese neighborhood, centered on St. Paul of the Shipwreck Church and the Maltese American Social Club, both on Oakdale Avenue. The area is served by the T-Third light rail line, and is home to the Bayview Opera House and City College Evans and Southeast Campus. The area is undergoing rapid development as the City tries to meet the demands of population growth and corporate investors have revalued the relatively large amount of buildable land. Hunters Point Shipyard and Candlestick Park areas are primary centers of development in the neighborhood. Despite its diversity, residents have a long history of coming together to create change and protect neighborhood assets. The Bayview Footprints Network maintains the neighborhood's longest-running blog, and the San Francisco Bay View is the local newspaper. Hunters Point Shipyard, a former Superfund site, and a polluting power plant have been focal points for environmental activists. The neighborhood was highly organized during the Civil rights movement, led by social justice advocates such as Julia Commer, Osceola Washington, Ruth Williams, Rosie Williams, Elouise Westbrook, Essie Webb, Espanola Jackson, Shirley Jones, and Alex Pitcher. Sam Jordan, boxing champion and tavern owner, was the first African American to run for Mayor of San Francisco. ==Belden Place== A small neighborhood near the Financial District, being the historical location of the French Quarter in San Francisco. ==Bernal Heights== Bernal Heights is a neighborhood perched on a hill in between the Mission district, Bayview, and the Portola district. The neighborhood is known for its community feeling and progressive vibe. The majority of the neighborhood is white, but there are significant Southern Italian, Latino and African American populations in the area as well. The main shopping area in Bernal Heights is Cortland Avenue, with a variety of storefronts that include a health food store, a community center, a yoga studio, bars, bakeries, and restaurants. Many of the quaint, hilly streets in the neighborhood are so narrow that two cars cannot pass in opposite directions without one car pulling over to the side of the road. ==Buena Vista== The Buena Vista neighborhood surrounds Buena Vista Park, south of the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. Market Street is to the south, and Corona Heights Park and neighborhood is to the east. ==Butchertown (Old and New)== China Basin and Old Butchertown in 1937 Butchertown (New) (see Islais Creek) is an industrial neighborhood in San Francisco that historically housed the city's slaughterhouses. It is one of the few remaining industrial sectors of San Francisco. Originally, Butchertown extended into the neighborhood now known as Dogpatch. Today's street borders are Cesar Chavez to the north, Interstate 280 to the west, Industrial Street and Oakdale Avenue to the south, and 3rd Street to the east. There are still two meat rendering plants in the neighborhood, and until pollution control measures were taken in 1995 the stench was still quite apparent. Butchertown is also headquarters to San Francisco's only active freight railroad, the San Francisco Bay Railroad,List of California railroads San Francisco Railroads a Class 3 short- line carrier. Old Butchertown was along the shores of Mission Creek on Mission Bay. Mission Bay, was subsequently to become the land-filled Mission Bay neighborhood. ==Castro== ==Cathedral Hill== Cathedral Hill is a small area in the Western Addition neighborhood surrounding Saint Mary's Cathedral on Geary Boulevard near Gough Street. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco and Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory are located in Cathedral Hill.

It is bordered by the Excelsior, Outer Mission, and Ingleside. The Muni streetcar historic \"car barn\" is at one corner of this neighborhood. Cayuga Park is located in this neighborhood. The Cayuga Improvement Association (CIA) covers the area bounded by Interstate 280, Mission Street, Sickles and Onondaga. ==China Basin== Mission Creek, aka China Basin Channel, has a \"restored\" water edge along the Mission Bay North frontage beyond the usual riverwalk. The ballpark terminates the view, and houseboats are visible at right. China Basin is a neighborhood built on landfill along the San Francisco Bay. It lies north of Mission Creek and the Mission Bay neighborhood, and includes Oracle Park, home of the San Francisco Giants, numerous restaurants, and the Caltrain railroad station. It borders on the South-of-Market (SOMA) neighborhood to the northwest and the South Beach neighborhood to the north. The term China Basin also refers to the body of water from which the neighborhood takes its name. This inlet where Mission Creek flows into the bay, home to a number of houseboats, was once an active industrial waterfront, though in recent decades the shore has been developed with residential condominiums. The portion of the waterway adjacent to the ballpark is often referred to as McCovey Cove, its unofficial name, which has a small ballfield, open to the public, named after Barry Bonds. The China Basin Heliport (IATA code JCC), used by the SFPD Aero Division until the division was disbanded, was located near the waterfront in the neighborhood. ==Chinatown== ==Civic Center== ==Clarendon Heights== The Clarendon Heights neighborhood is in the central part of San Francisco, to the north of Twin Peaks and east of Mount Sutro. It stretches down to Corbett Avenue or Market Street, and Clarendon Avenue borders the north and west side. ==Cole Valley== Cole Valley is a small neighborhood tucked into a u-shaped valley. Frederick Street is the northern boundary, Stanyan Street on the west, Clayton Street on the east, and the foothill (Belgrave Street) of Twin Peaks on the south.

Corona Heights is officially designated as part of District 5 (Central), subdistrict G, also known as neighborhood 5g, by the San Francisco Association of Realtors. The community is in close proximity to The Castro neighborhood. ==Cow Hollow== Cow Hollow is a generally affluent neighborhood located between Russian Hill and the Presidio and bordering the Marina District on one side and Pacific Heights on the other. The land was used for cow grazing (as its name would imply) and a settlement for fishermen (the coastline was much closer to this area than it is now). The main shopping thoroughfare is Union Street, known for its restaurants, boutique shopping, health spas, and wellness centers. ==Crocker- Amazon== ==Design District== The Design District is located in the low-lying area between Townsend Street and 16th Street, west of Mission Bay. It is a mixed industrial-office-retail area, with a concentration of showrooms and upscale shops, as well as the San Francisco campus of the California College of the Arts. ==Diamond Heights== ==Dogpatch== ==Dolores Heights== Dolores Heights is a hilly neighborhood named after the eponymous hill within the neighborhood. It borders the Castro to the north, Dolores Park to the east, Noe Valley to the south, and Upper Market to the west. Parts of it are so steep that the Muni Metro J Church line has to be routed through Dolores Park and into the Liberty Hill area before rejoining Church Street in Noe Valley at 22nd street. Many streets within Dolores Heights are dead-end cul de sacs connected by steep staircases with beautiful views. As a result, the area has become a favorite for morning boot camps. It is an affluent and quiet neighborhood with a mixture of Victorians, apartment buildings, and detached houses. In part due to its elevation, Dolores Heights does not have a visible homeless population as much as the Castro and the Mission District. Benefiting from Twin Peaks blocking the strong winds and fog found almost year-round in San Francisco, Dolores Heights remains relatively warm, sunny, and fog-free. ==Duboce Triangle== ==Embarcadero== ==Eureka Valley== The neighborhood known as \"Eureka Heights\" refers to the hill streets above Eureka Valley to the west, bounded by Market Street to the north and west, Douglas Street to the east, and 22nd Street to the south.

The Inner Sunset is west of Stanyan Street, south of Golden Gate Park, and north of Kirkham Street (the northern border for Golden Gate Heights) but may encompass some parts south all the way to Ortega (at 8th and 9th Avenues). Today, most would place the Inner Sunset's western border at 19th Avenue. However, historically, the Inner Sunset's borders extend out to 20th Avenue where the former Market Street Railway Company's #17 line used to run. ==Irish Hill== == Islais Creek == Also called Islais Landing, see Butchertown (Old and New)) ==Jackson Square== A six-block neighborhood, adjacent to the North Beach and Chinatown located immediately north of the Transamerica Pyramid. ==Japantown== ==Jordan Park== Jordan Park is a small neighborhood in the northern portion of San Francisco, bordered by Arguello Boulevard to the west, Geary Boulevard to the south, California Street to the north and Parker Avenue to the east.

It is named after the Spanish Mission Dolores settlement of 1776, and is a sub-area of the much larger Mission District. The location of the Mission Dolores was chosen because of proximity to the Yelamu grouping of the Ramaytush band of Ohlone-speaking peoples living in the villages of Chutchui and Sitlintac on Mission Creek which date to approximately A.D. 500. The Ohlone people together with the Coast Miwok served as laborers to build the Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds as part of the Spanish colonization.

Outsidelands.org (2003-05-26). Retrieved on 2014-05-10. Particularly noteworthy is its African American community, who migrated there in the 1960s from the Western Addition and Bayview neighborhoods.I am OMI \u2013 Western Neighborhoods Project \u2013 San Francisco History. Outsidelands.org (2003-05-26). Retrieved on 2014-05-10. Until the mid-1990s African Americans accounted for over 50% of its residents, many of whom were forced out due to the rising cost of living in San Francisco. Approximately 45,000 people live in the OMI (Oceanview-Merced-Ingleside), and, as of the 2000 United States Census, 45% of the population identifies itself as Asian-American, 25% as African-American, 14% as Latino and 13% as white. The demographic character of the OMI neighborhoods began to change after World War II. Many African-Americans, who had migrated to the Bay Area for work during the war, secured good-paying jobs and settled permanently in new homes in Ingleside, Merced Heights and Oceanview when the war ended. In 1950, African-Americans made up 5% of the population in the Ingleside, Merced Heights and Oceanview census tracts, and by 1970 the percentage had increased to 62%. Fueled by vacant land in Merced Heights and Oceanview, the post-war housing boom, the desire to own their own homes, and the already significant presence of African-Americans in the neighborhoods, the black population exploded from 1950 to 1960. By 1960, African-Americans made up 40% of Merced Heights, 32% of Ingleside and 59% of Oceanview. While some whites moved out, generally to suburban tracts heavily marketed to them, the number of blacks living in OMI increased twelvefold (from 602 in 1950 to 7,273 in 1960), while the citywide black population less than doubled (43,000 in 1950 to 74,000 in 1960). There is anecdotal evidence that African-Americans moved to the OMI after being displaced by the first phase of urban renewal in the Western Addition (the A-1 Project) in the late 1950s. Relocation records, while incomplete, show that the vast majority of displaced residents of the Western Addition found nearby accommodations. Of the 3,700 households of all races (family and single households) living in the project area in 1957, about 2,010 moved without relocation assistance and to unknown whereabouts. Of the remaining 1,602, 67% moved to other parts of the Western Addition and only 2.6%, or 34 households, moved to the West of Twin Peaks area. By 1970, the OMI had matured into a middle-class district of single-family, owner-occupied homes. Seventy-six percent of the land area in the Ingleside, Oceanview, and Merced Heights neighborhoods was residential (100% was residential in Ingleside Terraces), compared with 39% citywide. The housing stock was overwhelming single family (95% vs. 68% citywide) and owner- occupied (72% vs. 31% citywide), while the population was mostly African American (63% compared with 13% citywide). In recent years, the OMI has witnessed an influx of Asian- American and other ethnic groups, making it one of San Francisco's most diverse neighborhoods. The OMI is more Hispanic, Black, and Asian than San Francisco as a whole. ==Outer Mission== ==Outer Sunset== ==Pacific Heights== ==Parkmerced== ==Parkside== Parkside is to the south of the Sunset District, mainly south of Quintara Street between 19th Avenue and Sunset Boulevard. Abraham Lincoln High School is located on 24th Avenue, and the Parkside Library is located on Taraval Street at 23rd Avenue. Stern Grove borders the neighborhood to the south. \"The Parkside as a neighborhood started in July 1905 when a syndicate led by William Crocker announced they had quietly bought land from the estate of Adolph Sutro and others to create a new million-dollar development.

The large University Mound Reservoir is located along University Street, between Felton and Woolsey streets. Portola (pronounced PORE-toe-luh, by denizens) was named after the old Portola School, which in turn was named after the Spanish explorer Gaspar de Portol\u00e1 (credited by some as the discoverer of San Francisco Bay). Originally settled after the 1906 earthquake by Jewish and Italian immigrants, the area evolved into a community populated by nurserymen and their families who grew much of the city's flower crop there and uphill to the west in the Portola Heights extension. \"The Road,\" as San Bruno Avenue was affectionately referred to by the locals, still hosts businesses that include bakeries, grocery stores, pharmacies, and in earlier times the Avenue Theater, now a church. The Portola was also once home to a significant population of Maltese immigrants and settlers and at one time the Maltese Consulate.

Due to its proximity to downtown, following the Gold Rush this was San Francisco's first affluent neighborhood, but later became mostly industrial. Most of the natural landscape was demolished in the 1930s to make way for the Bay Bridge.
