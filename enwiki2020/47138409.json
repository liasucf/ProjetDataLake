While his birth date has not been established, it is on record that he received his education in Istanbul, attending the Turkish Military Academy. In 1857, he received an appointment as court painter; serving under Sultans Abd\u00fclmecid I and Abd\u00fclaziz, who gave him paintings by European artists, to serve as examples for his work.Excerpt from Ottoman Painting by Wendy Shaw @ GoogleBooks. As a court painter he was eventually promoted to Brigadier General (Tu\u011fgeneral) and became an art teacher at Kuleli Military High School. Most of Turkey's best-known painters were among his students, including Ahmet Ziya Akbulut, Hodja Ali R\u0131za and H\u00fcseyin Zekai Pasha. In 1877, during the Russo-Turkish War, he served as a military commander. Although he painted landscapes, most of his paintings deal with military subjects; notably battles and warships. These include his depiction of the Battle of Preveza (which was one of the first Turkish paintings to use Western-style oil techniques) and the sinking of the frigate Ertu\u011frul, following a good-will mission to Japan. ==References== ==External links== Category:1830s births Category:1906 deaths Category:Court painters of the Ottoman Empire Category:People from Istanbul Category:Turkish Military Academy alumni Category:Kuleli Military High School Category:Military art Category:Landscape painters Category:19th-century painters of the Ottoman Empire ",
