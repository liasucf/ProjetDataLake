    "text": "Kalikkalam () is a 1990 Malayalam film, directed by Sathyan Anthikad, starring Mammootty, Shobana and Murali in the lead roles. ==Plot== Mammootty, who is an orphan, plays the role of a burglar who is known by different names (Shankar / Antony / Tony Louis / Gauthaman / Pappan / Vasudevan / Ramakrishnan) in different places. He is a kind person and uses the illegal money he has burgled to help poor and orphans. In the beginning, he fakes himself as an Income Tax officer Sankar and raids a jewellery with the help of a newly posted police officer Shekhar, and takes the illegal gold along with him. Later, on knowing that he has been cheated, Shekhar sets out to put the Sankar behind the bars. He use various methods to trap him, but all go in vain. In between, we could see the good deeds that the burglar does with the stolen money. In the process he (Pappan) befriends Jamal, who is a poor chap. Pappan helps Jamal financially too. After giving a hint to police about his next target, Gauthaman loots the finance institution (Gopuram) owned by Devassy, where minister Velayil Chandy had deposited his illegal money. Though there was police protection for the institution, Gauthaman cleverly executes his plan and escapes with the money. On the parallel, a romance story between Mammootty's character (Tony Louis) and a young Christian girl, Annie, also gets progressed in between. He fakes himself as a Customs officer to Annie. Faking as Ramakrishnan, he busts out a drug group and send over the drug to Shekhar's office. However, he takes the money involved in that deal himself. Tracing the location of the phone calls made, Shekhar traced the residence of Sankar. However Sankar escapes by a whisker. S. I. Shekhar's indifference with one of the Abkari contractor cum newspaper publisher Ambalakkadan(Ambalakkadu Krishnan) creates problems, as false news regarding the SI and also his family gets published in the newspaper. Shekhar slaps Ambalakkadan for this, which ultimately leads to his suspension. As Annie takes the romance seriously, Tony finally reveals his actual identity and moves away from her life. Situations make Shekhar falsely accused as the murderer of Ambalakkadan, and Shekhar is sent to jail. At this stage, only Sankar can help Shekharan to prove his innocence. For this, Sankar had to confess his crimes and surrender in front of the law. ==Reception== N.Krishnaswamy of The Indian Express, in a February 22, 1991 review, wrote that the film is \"assured of theatrical outlets, and can afford to be what it is, and all that\". ==Cast== * Mammootty as Shankar / Antony / Tony Louis / Gauthaman / Pappan / Vasudevan / Ramakrishnan * Murali as CI Shekharan * Shobana as Annie * Sreenivasan as Jamal * Lalu Alex as Commissioner Mathews * C.
