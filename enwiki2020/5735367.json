In addition to this project he was also occupied in developing the plans for the Palacio de la Moneda to house the royal mint, which later became Chile's presidential palace. Joaqu\u00edn Toesca died in 1799 and did not live to see his two major projects, the Cathedral and the Palacio, completed. However, he did finish a number of other smaller works, including: the Cabildo de Santiago (city hall) of the Santiago Cabildo; the Hospital San Juan de Dios; the tajamares (levees) which would prove crucial in protecting the city from the floods of the Mapocho River; also worked in the construction of the Santo Domingo Church, Santiago. His designs were generally in the neoclassical style of the period.
