    "text": "The six-petal rosette is a design with six-fold dihedral symmetry composed from six Vesica piscis lenses arranged radially around a central point, often shown enclosed in a circumference of another six lenses. The design is found as a rosette ornament in artwork dating back to at least the Late Bronze Age. ==Construction== {| class=wikitable align=right width=180 |- align=center |160px |- |The seven overlapping circles grid forms a triangular lattice, seen here with hexagonal rings of 1, 7, 19, 37, 61, 91 circles.Islamic Art and Geometric Design: Activities for Learning |} The pattern figure can be drawn by pen and compass, by creating seven interlinking circles of the same diameter touching the previous circle's center. The second circle is centered at any point on the first circle. All following circles are centered on the intersection of two other circles. The expansion of the design into a regular overlapping circles grid is also known as \"Flower of Life\". Bartfeld (2005) describes the construction: \"This design consists of circles having a 1-[inch] radius, with each point of intersection serving as a new center. The design can be expanded ad infinitum depending upon the number of times the odd- numbered points are marked off.\", citing Drunvalo Melchizedek, The Ancient Secret of the Flower of Life (1999). The attribution of the term \"Flower of Life\" to Melchizedek (1999) is also found in and in . ==History and folk art== The design is attested from at least the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, represented, for example, on ornamental golden disks found in Shaft Grave III at Mycenae (16th century BC).Excavated by Heinrich Schliemann in 1876. Schliemann, Mykenae (1878), pp. 165-172. It is also found in some Cantabrian stelae, dated to the Iron Age. In ancient art, the ornament occurs alongside other patterns, such as eight-petal rosettes as well as arrangements of swirls or spirals, and the attribution of any kind of significance to its occurrence is purely speculative. Peralta Labrador (1989) cites a proposal according to which the design in the La T\u00e8ne (Celtic) period was a solar symbol associated with the god Taranis.Eduardo Peralta Labrador, Las estelas discoideas de Cantabria in: Estelas discoideas de la Peninsula Iberica (1989), pp 425\u2013466, citing the opinion of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Bl\u00e1zquez Mart\u00ednez. The six-petal rosette is common in the early modern (17th to 18th century) folk art of the Alpine region, in the Pyrenees (Cantabria, Navarre, Aragon), and parts of Eastern Europe.Ariel Golan, Prehistoric Religion: Mythology, Symbolism, (2003), p. 54. In Portugal, it is common to find it in medieval churches and cathedrals, as the engraved signature of a mason; but also as decoration and symbol of protection on the chimneys of old houses in Alentejo (at times together with the lauburu, or with Solomon's pentagram). The design is also known as \"Sun of the Alps\" (Sole delle Alpi) in Italy from its widespread use in alpine folk art. It resembles a pattern often found in that area on buildings. It is used in the coat of arms of Lecco Province. It has also been used as the emblem of Padanian nationalism in northern Italy since the 1990s. In 2001, Editoriale Nord, the publishing company of La Padania, registered the green-on-white design as a trademark.Ufficio Italiano Brevetti e Marchi, registrazione del simbolo del Sole delle Alpi. According to Rosanna Sapori of Radio Padania Libera, the trademark as of August 2010 was owned by Silvio Berlusconi, who would have obtained it in exchange for the bailout of the bankrupt Credieuronord bank \u00abVi racconto perch\u00e9 Bossi \u00e8 prigioniero di Berlusconi\u00bb Il Riformista 28 August 2010. ===Gallery=== File:Golden rosettes from the women graves.jpg|Ornamented gold disks from Shaft Grave III at Mycenae (16th century BC), Archaeological Museum, Istanbul.
