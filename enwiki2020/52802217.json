It is co-produced with Path\u00e9 and France 3 Cin\u00e9ma in France and Indigo Films and Rai Cinema in Italy. It has a budget of eleven million euro. It received financial support from Canal+ and the CNC. It received 375,000 euro from the Ile-de-France region's Support Fund for Film and Audiovisual Technical Industries. The project also won the Gan Foundation's Special Prize for 2016. The visual style is inspired by Buzzati's illustrations but also independent from the original book. The landscapes are inspired by real Mediterranean landscapes with liberties taken in order to create a fairytale- like atmosphere. Mattotti's ambition was to create a timeless visual style so that people who view the film in the future will not be able to see when it was made. The film was in production in November 2016. In a November 2016 interview, Mattotti expected it to be released in two or three years. == Reception == === Critical response === On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on 12 reviews. Oneofus.net called the movie an \"charming experience\" and \"refreshingly different\" giving the adults a strong recommendation to take children see it.https://oneofus.net/2019/07/infestation-annecy-animation-festival-2019-the- bears-famous-invasion-of-sicily/ ==References== ==External links== * * * Official website Category:Animated films about bears Category:Animated films based on children's books Category:Films based on works by Dino Buzzati Category:Films set in Sicily Category:French animated films Category:French films Category:Italian animated films Category:Italian films Category:Films with screenplays by Thomas Bidegain Category:2019 films ",
