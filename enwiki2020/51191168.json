The crossover was initially introduced as a concept car under the same name and was premiered at the 2014 S\u00e3o Paulo International Motor Show. Nissan claimed the concept is inspired by the streets of Brazil. Currently, the Kicks nameplate is used for two similar vehicles sold mainly in Brazil and India, albeit being built on different platforms. The V platform-based Kicks debuted in Sao Paulo, Brazil in 2016 with the P15 chassis code. The car was designed collaboratively by Nissan's design headquarters in Atsugi, Japan, Nissan Design America (NDA) in San Diego, California, and Nissan Design America Rio de Janeiro. The Kicks was then gradually rolling out across Latin America, then it entered the United States and Canada in 2018 to replace the Juke as the subcompact crossover offering in both countries. The Dacia B0 platform-based Kicks was introduced in India on 22 January 2019 with the P16 chassis code. The company claims the car is built on the platform to reduce production costs. As the result, it is slightly larger than the V platform-based Kicks, and retained the same wheelbase as the Dacia Duster and the Dacia B0 platform-based Renault Captur. == Global market (P15; 2016) == 2018 Nissan Kicks SV (P15, US) Originally unveiled as a concept in 2014, the Nissan Kicks was showcased across Brazil during summer 2016 to promote the Summer Olympics, of which Nissan was a lead sponsor. The crossover went on sale in China in July 2017, replacing the Nissan Livina C-Gear and the Nissan Juke. The Kicks made the North American debut in 29 November 2017 at the 2017 at the Los Angeles Auto Show and was slated to be on sale in June 2018. Imported from Mexico, it replaced the Nissan Juke and also indirectly replaced the Nissan Versa Note as a subcompact hatchback offering in the region. The Kicks features a standard touchscreen audio system with Bluetooth for hands-free calling and wireless stereo audio streaming, as well as USB integration and a rearview backup camera display. Up-level models also offer an upgraded infotainment system Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, as well as a Bose premium amplified audio system that features small speakers mounted in the front headrests. North American-market Kicks models also offer SiriusXM Satellite Radio on most models. ===Kicks e-Power=== On 15 May 2020, the Kicks e-Power was released in Thailand. It features a new look with new bumpers, headlights and tail lights. The Kicks e-Power combines a HR12DE 1.2-litre 3-cylinder petrol engine and an EM57 electric motor that drives the front wheels. The Kicks e-Power was also revealed in Japan on 24 June 2020 and released on 30 June 2020 as well as in Indonesia on 2 September 2020.

This motor generates and of torque. Nissan rates this engine to receive an EPA fuel economy rating of city and highway.

Due to a lack of an electronic stability program (ESP) in this particular trim, the Kicks nearly rolled over while performing the test at 65 km/h. A higher-spec model with ESP was also tested, and it managed to keep all four tires on the ground at the same speed but the driver did not feel the car could manage to return to the road, hence failing the test.

It replaced the Nissan Terrano, a restyled Dacia Duster offered since 2013. The Indian market Kicks extensively shared platform and parts with Dacia Duster and the Dacia B0 platform-based Renault Captur to cut costs, as all of them were manufactured in the same Renault-Nissan plant in Chennai. As the result, the Indian-market Kicks shares very little parts or sheet metal with the global Kicks. The P16 Kicks initially was offered with the H4K/HR15DE naturally aspirated petrol engine and the K9K diesel engine, both mated to a 6-speed manual transmission. Both engines are shared with the Renault Captur. In May 2020, Nissan announced the discontinuation of the K9K diesel engine due to the implementation of Bharat Stage 6 emission standards while offering the Renault-Nissan-Daimler HR13DDT petrol turbo engine as a replacement. The turbo engine is rated at and , which Nissan claimed is the most powerful in its segment. The engine is also offered with the X-Tronic CVT transmission option for the first time. As a marketing effort, the Kicks was made an official car for the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup. == Sales == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Calendar Year !Brazil !Mexico !China !Taiwan !USA !India |- |2016 |10,712 | | | | | |- |2017 |33,464 |22,438 |44,142 | | | |- |2018 |46,812 |21,801 |35,864 |6,554 |23,312 | |- |2019 |56,062 |17,837 |47,785 |16,882 |58,193 |4,776 |} == References == == External links == * (Japan) * (United States) Kicks Category:Cars introduced in 2016 Category:2020s cars Category:Mini sport utility vehicles Category:Crossover sport utility vehicles Category:Front- wheel-drive vehicles Category:Hybrid sport utility vehicles Category:Partial zero-emissions vehicles Category:Vehicles with CVT transmission Category:Hybrid electric cars ",
