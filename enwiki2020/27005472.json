    "text": "The function y = e\u22121/x2 is flat at x = 0\\. In mathematics, especially real analysis, a flat function is a smooth function \u0192 : \u211d \u2192 \u211d all of whose derivatives vanish at a given point x0 \u2208 \u211d. The flat functions are, in some sense, the antitheses of the analytic functions. An analytic function \u0192 : \u211d \u2192 \u211d is given by a convergent power series close to some point x0 \u2208 \u211d: : f(x) \\sim \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{k=0}^n\\frac{f^{(k)}(x_0)}{k!}(x-x_0)^k . In the case of a flat function we see that all derivatives vanish at x0 \u2208 \u211d, i.e. \u0192(k)(x0) = 0 for all k \u2208 \u2115. This means that a meaningful Taylor series expansion in a neighbourhood of x0 is impossible. In the language of Taylor's theorem, the non-constant part of the function always lies in the remainder Rn(x) for all n \u2208 \u2115. The function need not be flat at just one point. Trivially, constant functions on \u211d are flat everywhere. But there are other, less trivial, examples. ==Example== The function defined by : f(x) = \\begin{cases} e^{-1/x^2} & \\text{if }x eq 0 \\\\\\ 0 & \\text{if }x = 0 \\end{cases} is flat at x = 0\\. Thus, this is an example of a non-analytic smooth function. ==References== * Category:Real analysis Category:Algebraic geometry Category:Differential calculus Category:Smooth functions Category:Differential structures ",
