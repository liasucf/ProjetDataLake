    "text": "{| |} Vanguard was launched in Liverpool in 1799. She made four voyages as a slave ship. After the outlawing of the British slave trade she became a West Indiaman. A French privateer captured her in March 1809. ==Career== ===1st slave voyage (1799\u20131800)=== Captain John Whittle acquired a letter of marque on 1 November 1799. He sailed from Liverpool on 7 December. Whittle purchased his slaves at Bonny Island. Vanguard arrived at Jamaica on 29 June 1800 and landed 273 slaves. She left Jamaica on 2 September in company with and some other vessels sailing to Liverpool, and arrived back at Liverpool on 7 November. She had left Liverpool with 45 crew members and suffered 12 crew deaths on her voyage.Trans Atlantic Slave Trade Database \u2013 Vanguard voyage #83924. Vanguard appeared in Lloyd's Register (LR) in 1801 with J.Whittle, master, changing to D. Findlay, Dickson, owner, and trade Liverpool\u2013Africa, changing to Liverpool\u2013Jamaica.LR (1801), Seq.\u2116A10. Captain David Findlay acquired a letter of marque on 8 December 1800. ===2nd slave voyage (1802\u20131804)=== Captain William Taylor sailed from Liverpool on 15 October 1802, during the Peace of Amiens. War with France broke out again in early 1803 and he was issued a letter of marque in absentia on 22 July, shortly before Vanguard arrived in Grenada on 29 August. He had purchased his slaves first at Anomabu and then at Cape Coast Castle, and he landed 304. Vanguard sailed 22 November 1803 and arrived back at Liverpool on 22 January 1804. She had left Liverpool with 40 crew members and she suffered eight crew deaths on the voyage.Trans Atlantic Slave Trade Database \u2013 Vanguard voyage #83925. Taylor was no longer master of Vanguard when she was off Barbados before having delivered her slaves, having been replaced by John Pince. However, by the time she arrived back at Liverpool Richard Burrows had replaced Pince. The reason Pince replaced Taylor is that the two had entered into an illegal contract. Pince, knowing that his reputation as a cruel master would hamper his getting a crew, agreed with Taylor that Taylor would be the nominal master for a bonus of \u00a350, and that Pince would become master once the voyage was under way, with Taylor reverting to chief mate. The illegality rested in that the regulations of the slave trade required the actual master to sign various documents and give various undertakings. Taylor left Vanguard on the African coast and made his own way back to England. He had brought the case against Vanguards owners for lost wages and some other income and the court ruled that under the circumstances nothing was due either to Taylor or to the owners.Howard et al. (1853), pp.207\u2013213. John Pince died aboard Vanguard after a short illness as she was sailing from Grenada to Tortola.Hinton (1804), p.204 The announcement in Lloyd's Lists ship arrival and departure (SAD) data of Vanguards return simply recorded \"Vanguard, late Pine\".Lloyd's List (LL), \u21164421, SAD data. ===3rd slave voyage (1804\u20131805)=== Captain Richard Wilding acquired a letter of marque on 8 October 1804. He sailed from Liverpool on 1 November 1804 and purchased his slaves in the Congo River. Vanguard arrived at Barbados where she landed a few slaves, and then sailed on to Tortola where she landed the rest. In all she landed 290 slaves. She sailed from Tortola on 16 October 1805 and arrived back at Liverpool on 13 December. She had sailed from Liverpool with 51 crew members and she suffered seven crew deaths on the voyage.Trans Atlantic Slave Trade Database \u2013 Vanguard voyage #83926. ===4th slave voyage (1806\u20131807)=== Captain James Barr acquired a letter of marque on 18 April 1806. He sailed from Liverpool on 15 May 1806. He purchased his slaves at Bonny Island and stopped at S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 before sailing on to the West Indies.Trans Atlantic Slave Trade Database \u2013 Vanguard voyage #83927. LL reported on 6 February 1807 that Vanguard, of Liverpool, Barr, master, which had been reported to have been taken off Old Calabar by two French frigates and a brig,LL \u21164119. arrived at Jamaica on 8 December 1806 from Bonny.LL \u21164129. Vanguard arrived at Kingston, Jamaica, on 8 December 1806. There she landed 372 slaves. She sailed from Kingston on 22 March 1807 and arrived back at Liverpool on 12 May. She had sailed from Liverpool with 47 crew members and she suffered three crew deaths on the voyage. ===Post-slave trade=== The Slave Trade Act 1807 forbade British participation in the slave trade, forcing owners to deploy their vessels in other trades. Vanguard became a West Indiaman. LR for 1808 showed her master as Kitchen & Co., and her trade as Liverpool\u2013Trinidad.LR )1808), Seq.\u2116V11. Robert Kitchen and Benjamin Cors had been Vanguards owner on her fourth slave voyage. ==Fate== On 17 March 1809 Lloyd's List reported that the French privateer had captured Vanguard after an action lasting an hour and a half. Vanguard had been sailing from Trinidad to London, and Embuscade took her into Dieppe. Earlier, Vanguard had been able to capture a French privateer and to repel attacks by two others.Lloyd's List \u21164336. Embuscades captain was Antoine-Joseph Preira, a noted privateer captain. LR for 1809 carried unchanged data for Vanguard from the 1808 volume, except that it had the annotation \"captured\".LR (1809), Seq.\u2116V14. ==Citations and references== Citations References * Hinton, J.
