The practice was initially founded by Charles Kirk (senior) (1791\u20131847). Thomas Parry, (1818-1879) was an articled clerk to Charles Kirk. Parry married Henrietta, daughter of Charles Kirk in 1841 and formed a partnership with Charles Kirk. Following the death of Charles Kirk in 1847, his son, Charles Kirk (junior) (1825-1902), then became a partner with Thomas Parry. Charles Kirk Junior was the architect in the practice and Parry probably acted as an administrator.
