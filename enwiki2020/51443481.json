He played as a right-arm fast bowler, but had his career cut short by knee and back injuries. After his retirement, Dube moved into sports administration, serving as chairman of the Matabeleland Cricket Association, as a selector for the Zimbabwean national team, and as a member of the government's Sports and Recreation Commission. ==Playing career== Dube was born in Filabusi, in present-day Matabeleland South Province. He was raised in Bulawayo and attended Falcon College, taking up cricket at the age of 10, at a time when there were few black players. When he began playing club cricket at the age of 16 he was the only black player in his team.\"Ethan Dube's life in cricket\", Daily News, 10 February 2013. Retrieved 28 August 2016. Having earlier toured New Zealand with a Zimbabwe Schools team, Dube was one of four Zimbabweans selected to play for an ICC Associates XI at the 1988 Youth World Cup in Australia (the others being Trevor Penney, Glen Bruk-Jackson, and Eboo Essop- Adam). He appeared in five out of his team's seven matches, and took four wickets, with a best of 2/43 against the West Indies.Records / McDonald's Bicentennial Youth World Cup, 1987/88 - ICC Associates Young Cricketers / Batting and bowling averages , ESPNcricinfo. Retrieved 28 August 2016. As a youth, Dube was also a talented field hockey player, at one point forgoing selection for a cricket tour of England in order to participate in a hockey tour of Germany and the Netherlands. In 1990, Dube was selected in the Zimbabwean national team's squad for the 1990 ICC Trophy in the Netherlands. He made his first-class and List A debuts on a warm-up tour of England (against Yorkshire and Sussex, respectively),First-class matches played by Ethan Dube, CricketArchive.

That injury permanently weakened his knee, which caused him to change his bowling action. The new bowling action led to chronic back pain, with Dube stating that he \"never played a game without pain\" after 1992. Henry Olonga, who became the first black player to play Test cricket for Zimbabwe, later said that Dube was unfortunate to miss out on selection for Zimbabwe's first Test match, which came when India toured during the 1992\u201393 season.\"Exiled cricketer Henry Olonga on BTH: Part 1\", Nehanda Radio, 28 July 2010. Retrieved 28 August 2016. In early 1994, Dube played for Matabeleland in the 1993\u201394 edition of the Logan Cup, which was the first edition to hold first-class status. He made several further appearances over the following two seasons, but had little success, never taking more than two wickets in an innings. Dube's final first- class appearance came against Mashonaland Country Districts in the final of the 1995\u201396 Logan Cup. By that time, he had quit bowling altogether, and was instead playing as an opening batsman. Dube and his opening partner, Graeme Ferreira, made eight runs between them for the match, but Matabeleland still won, claiming their first Logan Cup title.Matabeleland v Mashonaland Country Districts, Lonhro Logan Cup 1995/96 (Final), CricketArchive.
