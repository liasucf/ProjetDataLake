    "text": "Hungary The Zweigelt is a new Austrian hybrid grape created in 1922 by Friedrich Zweigelt (1888\u20131964), who later became Director of the Federal Institute and Experimental Station of Viticulture, Fruit Production and Horticulture (1938\u20131945). It comprises a crossing between St. Laurent and Blaufr\u00e4nkisch. ==Wine regions== Widely planted in Austria, Zweigelt vines have made inroads in the Canadian wine regions of Ontario's Niagara Peninsula and of British Columbia, with limited plantings in Hungary. In the Czech Republic it is known as Zweigeltrebe and is the third-most widely planted red-grape variety, comprising approximately 4.7% of total vineyards. Wine of Czech Republic ; see chart at It grows in most of the wine regions in Slovakia. , newly established Belgian and Polish vineyards have also started to plant Zweigelt. , Washington state U.S.A. has several small plantings (only a few acres) of Zweigelt, including Wilridge Winery and Perennial Vintners. ==Naming and Synonyms== Zweigelt is also known as Rotburger (not to be confused with Rotberger), Zweigeltrebe, and Blauer Zweigelt. Lenz Moser recognised the suitability of the \u201cBlaufr\u00e4nkisch x St. Laurent\u201d variety for high-trained vines as early as the 1950s. Moser considered the designation \u201cBlaufr\u00e4nkisch x St. Laurent\u201d to be too long, and from this point onwards argued that the crossing should be named after its original grower, Friedrich Zweigelt.Cf. Daniel Deckers: Friedrich Zweigelt as reflected by contemporary sources. In: Wine in Austria. The History. Brandst\u00e4tter Verlag, Vienna 2019, , p. 179. By 1958, the naming process had reached a stage at which it could no longer be stopped.Daniel Deckers: Friedrich Zweigelt as reflected by contemporary sources. In: Wine in Austria. The History. Brandst\u00e4tter Verlag, Vienna 2019, , p. 190. The official designation \u201cZweigeltrebe Blau\u201d appeared for the first time in 1972, when the new Grape Variety Index for Qualit\u00e4tsweine (Quality Wines) was launched.Cf. Daniel Deckers: Friedrich Zweigelt as reflected by contemporary sources. In: Wine in Austria. The History. Brandst\u00e4tter Verlag, Vienna 2019, , p. 191. The name of the variety was altered to \u201cBlauer Zweigelt\u201d in 1978, and the synonym \u201cRotburger\u201d was created at the same timeOrdinance of the Federal Minister of Agriculture and Forestry of 20 September 1978 (Federal Law Gazette No. 517/1978).. The aim here was to make it clear that the new cultivations of Blauburger, Goldburger and Rotburger/Blauer Zweigelt all shared a common origin.Verbal explanation provided by Josef Weiss, Director of the Federal Institute of Viticulture and Fruit Production in Klosterneuburg for many years. No evidence can be found to support the widespread assertion that Zweigelt himself had applied the designation \u201cRotburger\u201d to his new variety. \u201cRotburger\u201d remains a valid synonym and continues to be used as a label designation by Austrian vintners, although most producers prefer the name Zweigelt.Johann Werfring: Der Rote von der Burg. In: \u201cWeinherbst 2013\u201d, supplement to the \u201cWiener Zeitung\u201d of 2 November 2013, p. 8. The problem of naming the variety after a committed National Socialist was first addressed publicly in December 2018.Aktion \u201eAbgezweigelt\u201c \u2013 Zweigelt soll in \u201eBlauer Montag\u201c umbenannt werden.

The wine tends to be darker in color than Pinot Noir grown in the same area, and produces a larger crop than Pinot Noir.Zweigelt cluster at Perennial Vintners, Puget Sound AVA, USA ==See also== *Blauburger - red grape created by Zweigelt the following year ==References== Category:Red wine grape varieties Category:Austrian wine Category:Czech wine Category:Hungarian wine Category:Food and drink introduced in 1922 ",
