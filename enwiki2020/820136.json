It was established in the early 20th century as the commercial district for the adjacent Inman Park and Candler Park neighborhoods, and has since become famous for the alternative culture it brings to Atlanta. It has been described as Atlanta's version of Haight-Ashbury, a melting pot of sub- cultures, and the Bohemian center of the Southern United States.Little Five Points Creative Loafing. ==Name== The name is a reference to Five Points, which is the center of downtown Atlanta. \"Little\" Five Points refers to the intersection at the center of the neighborhood. Two points are provided by Moreland Avenue (U.S. 23 and Georgia 42), which runs perfectly north/south, and forms the county line dividing Fulton and DeKalb. Two points are provided by Euclid Avenue, which runs northeast/southwest. The fifth point was originally Seminole Avenue, which met the intersection from the northwest, but the Seminole point was converted to a plaza and there is no longer a five- point intersection, though some regard McLendon Avenue, extending east from Euclid's southern intersection at Moreland, as the new fifth point. ==History== The first Atlanta streetcars were constructed just south of the Little Five Points in the 1890s. According to the National Park Service, as the population grew on Atlanta's east side, the area where the trolley lines converged became one of the earliest major regional shopping centers. Little Five Points thrived until the 1960s, when a proposed freeway through the heart of the district drove residents out of the neighborhood.Little Five Points in Fulton County (30307) ajchomefinder. By the 1970s, Little Five Points had fallen into disrepair. A revitalization began as urban pioneers moved into the then-cheap neighborhood and restored the Victorian-style homes. By 1981, local merchants formed the Little Five Points Partnership to continue the restoration and expansion of the retail area, turning what was formerly a gas station into the \"484 retail area\" \u2014 several retail shops aligned in strip- mall style.Little Five Points: Atlanta's Alternative Neighborhood city- data.com. ==Geography== Little Five Points is surrounded by the Inman Park, Edgewood, Candler Park and Poncey-Highland neighborhoods of Atlanta.

Mural by Jerkface in Little Five Points Little Five Points is one of Atlanta's best neighborhoods for viewing street art. Unlike most of Atlanta's neighborhoods, the street art in Little Five Points is highly concentrated in a compact easily walked area. Works by internationally known street artists such as Jerkface can be found as well as works by local artist such as Chris Veal and R. Land. But finding the murals can be a bit of a treasure hunt. Many works of street art are tucked away on the back sides of buildings, in alleyways, and in back parking lots. Both the easily visible and hidden gems of street art in Little Five Points are mapped on the Atlanta Street Art Map. ==References== ==External links== *History of Inman Park - Little Five Points * L5P Alliance Category:1900s establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Neighborhoods in Atlanta ",
