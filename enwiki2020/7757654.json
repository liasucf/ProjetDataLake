The Great Western Railway had leased the Bristol and Exeter Railway from its opening and provided the locomotives up until 1849. The Bristol and Exeter Railway in turn provided the broad gauge locomotive power on most of the railways with which it had junctions: * Bristol and Portishead Port and Pier Railway * Somerset Central Railway * West Somerset Railway and Minehead Railway * Devon and Somerset Railway * Exeter and Crediton Railway ==Engineering== The railway established workshops at Bristol Temple Meads railway station in September 1854, the site later being known as Bath Road. Engine sheds were provided at major stations and on some branches including at Taunton railway station and Exeter St Davids railway station. The engineer was Charles Hutton Gregory until May 1850, when James Pearson was appointed as Locomotive Engineer. He designed several classes of tank engines, including large 4-2-4T locomotives. ==Locomotive types== ===Broad gauge=== * 1849 4-2-2 locomotives \u2013 20 passenger locomotives * 1849 0-6-0 locomotives \u2013 12 goods locomotives * 1849 Fairfield \u2013 a steam railmotor * 1851 2-2-2T locomotives \u2013 7 small tank locomotives * 1854 4-2-4T locomotives \u2013 8 locomotives with 9 feet wheels * 1855 4-4-0ST locomotives \u2013 26 saddle tank locomotives * 1856 0-6-0 locomotives \u2013 6 goods locomotives * 1859 4-2-4T replacements \u2013 2 locomotives with 7 feet 6-inch wheels * 1866 0-6-0ST locomotives \u2013 2 small tank locomotives * 1868 4-2-4T renewals \u2013 4 locomotives with 8 feet 10-inch wheels * 1870 2-4-0 locomotives \u2013 10 passenger locomotives * 1872 0-4-0T locomotives \u2013 2 small well tank locomotives * 1872 0-6-0 locomotives \u2013 14 Swindon Class goods locomotives purchased from the Great Western Railway * 1874 2-4-0 locomotives \u2013 3 convertible passenger locomotives * 1874 no. 110 \u2013 a small tank engine, originally built for the South Wales Mineral Railway * 1874 0-6-0T no. 111 ===Standard gauge=== The Bristol and Exeter Railway operated 28 standard gauge locomotives. Five of these spent a short while working as broad gauge locomotives. ===Narrow gauge=== The Bristol and Exeter Railway owned two locomotives \u2013 numbers 112 and 113 \u2013 for working the 3 feet gauge lines in its ballast quarry at Westerliegh, Devon. ==Locomotives in numerical order== * 1 : 1849 Broad gauge 4-2-2 : 1875 Standard gauge locomotive * 2 : 1849 Broad gauge 4-2-2 : 1872 Broad
