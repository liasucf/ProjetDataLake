In 1924, Tsai married Taiwan independence activist Peng Hua-ying. She founded her own hospital at Taichu in 1925. She created a seminar to train midwives in obstetrics, which was made part of her hospital. However, she had to end the seminar in 1938 as the Japanese, who had invaded northern China in 1937, came to her seminar and forced some of the students to work for them as nurses on the front lines. The serial drama \"Wave Washing Sands,\" about her life, won Best Serial Drama at the Golden Bell Awards in 2005. ==References== Category:1899 births Category:1990 deaths Category:Taiwanese people of Hoklo descent Category:Taiwanese women physicians ",
