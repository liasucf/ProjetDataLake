    "text": "Elections to Gedling Borough Council in Nottinghamshire were held on 2 May 2019, the same day as the other local government elections in England and Northern Ireland. The election used the nineteen wards created as a result of boundary commission recommendations formulated for the 2015 contest, with each division electing between one and three Councillors using the first-past-the- post electoral system. A total of 41 representatives were elected. After the 2015 election, a Labour majority administration of 25 was formed. In 2019, Labour gained four seats, increasing their numbers to 29, eight clear of the Council's majority threshold. ==Ward results== ===Bestwood St Albans=== ===Calverton=== ===Carlton=== ===Carlton Hill=== ===Cavendish=== ===Colwick=== ===Coppice=== ===Daybrook=== ===Dumbles=== ===Ernehale=== ===Gedling=== ===Netherfield=== ===Newstead Abbey=== ===Phoenix=== ===Plains=== ===Porchester=== ===Redhill=== ===Trent Valley=== ===Woodthorpe=== ==References== Category:2019 English local elections Category:2010s in Nottinghamshire Category:May 2019 events in the United Kingdom 2019 ",
