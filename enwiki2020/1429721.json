    "text": "is one of the major mountains in Gunma Prefecture, Japan. Its straddles the border between the municipalities of Annaka, Shimonita and Tomioka. Well known for its rocks weathered into fantastic forms, this famous peak is ranked among Japan's three most noted places of rugged beauty. There are many hiking courses, and when the foliage changes color there are splendid views to be seen. The highest point is the peak of the Mt. S\u014dmadake (\u76f8\u99ac\u5cb3) reaching .It is also a National Place of Scenic Beauty as determined by the Agency for Cultural Affairs in Japan in 1923. Mount My\u014dgi, along with Mount Akagi and Mount Haruna, is one of the \"Three Mountains of J\u014dm\u014d\". (J\u014dm\u014d is an old name for Gunma.) == Overview == Mount My\u014dgi is composed of many different peaks: Hakuun-zan (\u767d\u96f2\u5c71), Kond\u014d-san (\u91d1\u6d1e\u5c71), Kinkei-san (\u91d1\u9d8f\u5c71), S\u014dma-dake (\u76f8\u99ac\u5cb3), Mitake- san (\u5fa1\u5cb3\u5c71), Ch\u014dsunokashira (\u4e01\u9808\u30ce\u982d), Yakyu-san (\u8c37\u6025\u5c71) and others. Mount My\u014dgi is generally separated in its south side (known as the front side) and its north side (known as the back side). For instance, when looking at Kinkei-san from Shimonita, the mount is referred to as Nakano-take (\u4e2d\u4e4b\u5dbd). Among the many peaks of Mount My\u014dgi, which is already considered having a picturesque form, the landscape of Nakano-take is very particular. Along the slope of the mountain, there is a group of rocks with unique names (\u30ed\u30a6\u30bd\u30af\u5ca9 \"candle rock\" , \u5927\u7832\u5ca9 \"cannon rock\", \u7b46\u982d\u5ca9 \"head of the family rock\", \u30e6\u30eb\u30ae\u5ca9 \"shaky rock\", \u865a\u7121\u50e7\u5ca9 \"nihilist monk rock\") that make it praised as one of the most beautiful mountains over Japan. The starting point of the hiking course going through those rocks is Nakano- dake shrine (\u4e2d\u4e4b\u5dbd\u795e\u793e). The most famous temple of the divine mountain, My\u014dgi Shrine (\u5999\u7fa9\u795e\u793e), is located on Hakuun-zan, on the east slope of Mount My\u014dgi. During Edo period, people thought that the god of the mountain protected the population from fire and lightnings. Mount Fuji is located south of Mount My\u014dgi. Mount My\u014dgi is made out of volcanic rocks (dacite, tuff) and conglomerates. It was formed 3 million years ago, at the same time as Mount Arafune located south-west, after a volcanic caldera. Later, the soft sedimentary layer is thought to have been eroded which gave the mountain its current rugged appearance. Mount My\u014dgi is designated as one of Japan's Three Great Rare Scenic Beauties and was selected as one of the 100 Landscapes of Japan. == Hiking == The landscape being very rugged, many severe accidents and deaths have been reported. As a consequence, Tomioka city introduced courses for beginners, intermediates and experienced hikers. In January 2010, Gunma prefecture officials, local authorities, the police, firemen and the hiking club discussed the issue during the \"Meeting for the establishment of preventive measures to avoid accidents in Mount Myogi and surrounding mountains\". The proposition of the officials to forbid hiking was rejected by the locals who wished to continue hiking. Finally, all participants agreed to increase the number of chains and to improve the quality of the routes. == Use of the name \"My\u014dgi\" in the prefecture == * During sport festivals, many primary schools of the prefecture name their teams \"Team Myogi\", \"Team Haruna\" or \"Team Asama\" * The three dormitories of Tomioka Silk Mill, registered as a UNESCO World Heritage since 2014, are also named \"Myogi Dormitory\", \"Haruna Dormitory\" and \"Asama Dormitory\" == In popular culture == Mount My\u014dgi is mentioned in the street racing manga, video game, and anime series Initial D. It is the home course of the racing team called the Myogi Night Kids, and is the setting for three races in the anime and manga. ==1900 Massacre== On 7 February 1900 a Japanese man killed seven people at the My\u014dgi shrine. The man grabbed a sword from a policeman, killed the chief priest and three attendants, and then turned against the crowd who had rushed to the scene, murdering three other people, before he himself was killed.http:of shocking murders at Yokohama, Los Angeles Times (February 23, 1900)http:of News from Japan, The Chanute Daily Tribune (February 23, 1900) ==Gallery== file:\u5999\u7fa9\u5c71 - panoramio.jpg|Panorama view file:Mt.
