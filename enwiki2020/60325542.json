It experienced a continuous change of the form and the aesthetic expressiveness. From the satire, the caricature or the cartoon and fantastic realism, his work came to monochrome painting, which, according to Rusina, represents the calm, death and infinity of nature. The \"nothing\" or the \"emptiness\" - so called by Rusina himself - are to find expression in his last works.
