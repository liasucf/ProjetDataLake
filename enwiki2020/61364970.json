The church is inscribed on the list of the Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance of Georgia. == Location and architecture == The Samtsevrisi church is built on a low hill on the left bank of the Dzama river, at the eastern end of the watershed plateau between the Kura and Dzama valleys. Due to its commanding position, the church is visible from Georgia's main east\u2013west highway and railway to the north.

The general proportions are harmonious and complete. Its \"free-cross\" design, with a horseshoe apse in a cross plan, stylistically dates to the early 7th century, with a bit of the 16th-century stonework\u2014a single-nave funeral chapel\u2014to the southwest. The dome rests on an octagonal base, supported by four large and eight smaller squinches and containing two windows, to the east and to the west. Three more window are found in the lower part of the building. The entrance to the church is from the south. The only decorations are the pommels and cornices around windows. The building was significantly damaged in an earthquake on 8 May 1940 and was subsequently repaired by a team of Georgian specialists between 1950 and 1953.
