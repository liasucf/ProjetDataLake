    "text": "Caazap\u00e1 () is a city in Paraguay, founded in 1607, by Friar Luis de Bola\u00f1os. It is located in the Caazap\u00e1 District and is the capital of the Caazap\u00e1 Department. The name Caazap\u00e1 comes from the Guarani words \"Ka'aguy jehasapa\" which means \"after the forest\", because the natives believed that after the forest, God, with the attendance of Friar Luis de Bola\u00f1os, has made born water from the Earth. There are five neighbourhoods called \"Barrios\" in the city: Then main one is the Barrio San Pablo, the other 4 are: Barrio Santa Teresita, Barrio San Bl\u00e1s, Barrio San Antonio, and Barrio San Roque-within which is the original Chapel, built by franciscans during the famous Jesuit reductions of Paraguay. The Franciscan Reduction at Caazap\u00e1 was an important event in Paraguayan cultural heritage. In 1989, with the new government of President Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez, Caazap\u00e1 City became the new capital of the Department of Caazap\u00e1. This is because the Departments of Caazap\u00e1 and Guair\u00e1 were linked before and the only capital for both was Villarrica. ==References== *Geograf\u00eda Ilustrada del Paraguay, Distribuidora Arami SRL; 2007. *Geograf\u00eda del Paraguay, Primera Edici\u00f3n 1999, Editorial Hispana Paraguay SRL ==External links== * https://web.archive.org/web/20110708110526/http://www.caazapapotyfm.com/ Category:Populated places in the Caazap\u00e1 Department Category:1607 establishments in South America ",
