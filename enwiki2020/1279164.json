    "text": "PMMP was a Finnish band fronted by singers Paula Vesala and Mira Luoti and backed by musicians Mikko Virta, Juho Vehmanen and Heikki Kyt\u00f6l\u00e4. The name of the band is often said to be an abbreviation of the sentence \"Paulan ja Miran Molemmat Puolet\", which can be translated in English as \"Both Sides of Paula and Mira\". However, in an interview on the Finnish talk show Krisse Show, they stated that the name of the band comes, like ABBA, from the names of 4 of its members: so PMMP is Paula, Mira, Mira, Paula. PMMP's albums were produced by former Thergothon drummer Jori Sj\u00f6roos, who also wrote the music for all the songs. The lyrics are written by Paula and Mira. The band is an acclaimed live act. PMMP first became well known in Finland with the 2003 summer hit Rusketusraidat (\"Tan Lines\"). They then enjoyed great success with their second album Kovemmat k\u00e4det (\"Rougher Hands\"), which sold gold (double platinum year 2010). An extended version of the album was released in August 2005. Oo siell\u00e4 jossain mun, a single from the aforementioned album, is PMMP's biggest hit so far in Finland. In November 2006 PMMP released their third album Leski\u00e4idin tytt\u00e4ret (\"Daughters of a widow mother\"), which sold platinum on the day it was released. They released an album labeled Puuhevonen (\"Wooden Horse\") with traditional children's songs in 2007, around the time their first children were born. In 2009 they released their fourth rock/pop album Veden varaan (\"Overboard\") and their fifth album Rakkaudesta (\"Of Love\"), released in 2012, is considered as their comeback album. PMMP played their final concert on October 27, 2013 in the sold-out Helsinki Ice Hall. ==\"Matka jatkuu vaan\" \u2013 The Journey Continues== In an article titled \"Matka jatkuu vaan\" in the biggest Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (17.2.2007), journalist Leena Virtanen attempts to explain how it is that PMMP appeal to both children and adults, concluding that while indeed an energetic pop band PMMP \"live within the space between childhood and adulthood\", referring to the lifeworlds of both children and adults, carried through with eternal optimism. Virtanen concludes with the words from one of PMMP's best known songs \"Matkalaulu\" (travel song), which is in fact a song about the band being on the road: \"T\u00e4m\u00e4 voi olla koko el\u00e4m\u00e4mme ihanin p\u00e4iv\u00e4. Ajetaan hiljempaa. Toivon, ett\u00e4 matka jatkuu, jatkuu vaan\" [This could be the most wonderful day of our whole life. Let's drive slower. I hope the journey goes on, goes on and on...\"] ==Activism== PMMP has supported Amnesty International's work against the violence towards women. The song Joku raja from the album Leski\u00e4idin tytt\u00e4ret is named after Amnesty's campaign by the same name. On 25 May 2013 PMMP was supposed to perform together with two members of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot at the Maailma kyl\u00e4ss\u00e4 (World Village) festival in Helsinki. The members of Pussy Riot had disappeared and PMMP performed without them but supported their cause for human rights in Russia. Following that event, after 10 years of performing, the group disbanded. ==The members of PMMP== *Paula Vesala, December 10, 1981 - vocals *Mira Luoti, February 28, 1978 - vocals *Mikko Virta, March 22, 1982 - guitar, backing vocals *Juho Vehmanen, March 31, 1981 - bass guitar, backing vocals, keyboards *Heikki Kyt\u00f6l\u00e4, October 14, 1981(?) - drums, percussion, backing vocals PMMP in concert, 2006 ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=wikitable |- !Year !style=\"width:200px;\"|Album !Peak positionFinnishCharts.com PMMP page !CertificationIFPI - PMMP page |- |style=\"text-align:center;\"|2003 |Kuulkaas enot! *Released: 5 September 2003 *Record label: BMG |style=\"text-align:center;\"|6 |Platinum |- |style=\"text- align:center;\"|2005 |Kovemmat k\u00e4det *Released: 9 March 2005 *Record label: Sony BMG *Also special release Kovemmat k\u00e4det (Kumipainos) |style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |2x platinum |- |style=\"text-align:center;\"|2006 |Leski\u00e4idin tytt\u00e4ret *Released: 15 November 2006 *Record label: Sony BMG |style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |Platinum |- |style=\"text-align:center;\"|2007 |Puuhevonen *Released: 14 November 2007 *Record label: Sony BMG |style=\"text-align:center;\"|3 |Platinum |- |style=\"text-align:center;\"|2009 |Veden varaan *Released: 25 November 2009 *Record label: Sony Music |style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |Platinum |- |style=\"text-align:center;\"|2012 |Rakkaudesta *Released: 11 June 2012 *Record label: Sony Music |style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |Gold |- |style=\"text- align:center;\"|2013 |Hitit *Released: December 2013 *Record label: Sony Music |style=\"text-align:center;\"|16 | |} ===Singles=== *2003: \"Rusketusraidat\" (#1) Tan Lines *2003: \"Niina\" (promo only) *2003: \"Joutsenet\" (#8) *2005: \"P\u00e4iv\u00e4koti\" (#13) Kindergarten *2005: \"Oo siell\u00e4 jossain mun\" (promo only) *2005: \"Matkalaulu\" Journey Song (promo only) *2005: \"Pikkuveli\" Little Brother (promo only) *2006: \"Henkil\u00f6kohtaisesti\" Face to Face *2006: \"T\u00e4ss\u00e4 el\u00e4m\u00e4 on\" Life Is Here (radio only) *2006: \"Kiitos\" (promo / radio only) *2007: \"Joku raja\" (#1) *2009: \"Viimeinen valitusvirsi\" The Last Jeremiad *2009: \"Lautturi\" Ferryman (promo/radio only) *2009: \"Pariterapiaa\" Couple Therapy *2009: \"Lapsuus loppui\" Childhood Ended (promo/radio only) *2012: \"Heliumpallo\" Helium Balloon *2012: \"Rakkaalleni\" To My Love ==References== *Mira Luoti, Paula Vesala, Hanna Yl\u00f6nen, Pasi Kostiainen, PMMP.
