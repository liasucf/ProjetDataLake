    "text": "An Elixir for Existence is the second studio album by the Norwegian gothic metal band Sirenia, released in 2004. The album follows in the same vein as the previous At Sixes and Sevens, but includes a new female vocalist, Henriette Bordvik. A large number of the songs are concerned with mental conditions, be it depression (\"Voices Within\"), drug use (\"Euphoria\") or thoughts of suicide (\"The Fall Within\"); of course, the meanings of all of these songs are subject to further conjecture. ==Track listing== All songs written by Morten Veland. ==Credits== *Morten Veland \u2013 harsh vocals (on all tracks except #6 & #9), all other instruments *Henriette Bordvik \u2013 female vocals (on all tracks except #9) *Kristian Gundersen \u2013 clean male vocals (on tracks #3, #4 & #7) *Anne Verdot \u2013 violin (on tracks #2, #3, #4 & #6) *Damien Surian, Mathieu Landry, Emmanuelle Zoldan, Sandrine Gouttebel, Emilie Lesbros \u2013 choir (on all tracks except #6) ==References== ==External links== * Metallum Archives * An Elixir for Existence at discogs.com Category:2004 albums Category:Sirenia (band) albums Category:Napalm Records albums ",
