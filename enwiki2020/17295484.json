    "text": "The 1996 Stanley Cup playoffs, the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL), began on April 16, 1996. The 16 teams that qualified (8 from each conference) played best-of-seven series for conference quarterfinals, semifinals and championships, and then the conference champions played a best- of-seven series for the Stanley Cup. These playoffs are noted as being the first playoffs in which all Canadian teams were eliminated during the first round. The New Jersey Devils, who had won the Stanley Cup the year before, failed to qualify for these playoffs. This was the first time that both Florida teams\u2014the Florida Panthers and Tampa Bay Lightning\u2014made it to the playoffs. The playoffs ended on June 10 with the Colorado Avalanche sweeping the Florida Panthers in both teams' first-ever Finals appearance. It was Colorado's first-ever Stanley Cup championship in their inaugural season after relocating from Quebec City prior to the start of the regular season; in the previous years, they were known as the Quebec Nordiques. Joe Sakic was named playoff MVP and awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy. For the second time in three years and the last time until 2013, all of the Original Six teams reached the playoffs. This was also the last time all three California-based teams missed the playoffs in the same year until 2020.

Despite being outshot 33\u201325 in Game 1, the Panthers came out on top with an impressive 5\u20131 win. Florida goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck made 32 saves and Florida forward Tom Fitzgerald scored twice. The Penguins wanting to avoid going down two games to none against the Panthers came out with a better effort in game two and won the game 3\u20132 and evened the series at one game each. In Game 3, the Panthers fired an incredible 61 shots on Penguins goaltender Tom Barrasso and it paid off as the Panthers won 5\u20132 to take a 2\u20131 series lead, with Florida forward Stu Barnes scoring twice. Going into the third period of Game 4, the Penguins trailed 1\u20130.

In Game 7, Florida took a 1\u20130 lead on Mike Hough's goal at 13:13 of the first period.

Florida hung on to win the game 3\u20131 and the series four games to three, John Vanbiesbrouck making 39 saves in the victory. To date, this remains the last playoff series victory for the Panthers. ===Western Conference Final=== ====(1) Detroit Red Wings vs. (2) Colorado Avalanche==== This was the first playoff series between these two teams. This was the fourth conference final appearance for Detroit and second in consecutive years as the Red Wings defeated Chicago in five games the year before. Colorado made their third conference final appearance in franchise history and first since losing to Philadelphia in six games in 1985 when the team was known as the Quebec Nordiques. Game 1 was a hard-fought battle. The score was tied at two in the first overtime period when Mike Keane scored at 17:31 to give Colorado a 3\u20132 win. The Avalanche won Game 2, 3\u20130, with Colorado goaltender Patrick Roy stopping all 35 shots faced. Down two games to none, the Red Wings played solidly in Game 3. Detroit defencemen Nicklas Lidstrom and Vladimir Konstantinov combined to score three goals (including a shorthanded goal by Konstantinov) and Detroit won 6\u20134. In game four the Red Wings outshot the Avalanche 31\u201317 but lost the game 4\u20132 thanks to 29 saves made by Patrick Roy. Detroit played with desperation and determination in game five. Inspired by Vladimir Konstantinov's big body check on Avalanche forward Claude Lemieux, the Red Wings went on to win 5\u20132. The Red Wings victory forced a Game 6 back in Colorado. Game 6 became famous in the history of the Red Wings-Avalanche rivalry. At 14:07 of the first period, Detroit forward Kris Draper was down along the half-boards at centre ice when Colorado forward Claude Lemieux checked Draper's head from behind into the edge of the bench. The hit sent Draper to the hospital with a broken jaw and a shattered cheek and orbital bone, which required surgery and stitches. Draper did not return to play until the middle of the 1996\u201397 season. While Lemieux was assessed a five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct match penalty for the hit,1996: Rogue Claude clips Draper's Wings - CBC Archives the Avalanche went on to win the game 4\u20131 and completed the upset. The controversial hit on Draper by Lemieux was a catalyst (along with a rough hit by Kozlov on Foote in Game 3) for the Detroit\u2013Colorado rivalry that endured for a decade. ==Stanley Cup Finals== Since the formation of the NHL in 1917 this was the only time to date that both teams competing in the Stanley Cup Finals made their first appearance. This was the first and to date only playoff series between these two teams. Colorado made their first Finals appearance in their first season in Denver, this was the franchise's seventeenth season in the league, while Florida made their first Finals appearance in just their third season of existence. Colorado became the third NHL team to win the Stanley Cup following a relocation, and the first to do so in their inaugural season after relocation. ==Playoff statistics== ===Skaters=== These are the top ten skaters based on points.NHL.com - Skater Stats {| style=\"padding:3px; border-spacing:0; text-align:center;\" class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! style=\"width:12em\" | Player ! style=\"width:12em\" | Team ! style=\"width:4em\" | ! style=\"width:4em\" | ! style=\"width:4em\" | ! style=\"width:4em\" | ! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:4em\" | ! style=\"width:4em\" | |-align=center |align=left|Joe Sakic||align=left|Colorado Avalanche||22||18||16||34||+10||14 |-align=center |align=left|Mario Lemieux||align=left|Pittsburgh Penguins||18||11||16||27||+3||33 |-align=center |align=left|Jaromir Jagr||align=left|Pittsburgh Penguins||18||11||12||23||+7||18 |-align=center |align=left|Valeri Kamensky||align=left|Colorado Avalanche||22||10||12||22||+11||28 |-align=center |align=left|Peter Forsberg||align=left|Colorado Avalanche||22||10||11||21||+10||18 |-align=center |align=left|Petr Nedved||align=left|Pittsburgh Penguins||18||10||10||20||+3||16 |-align=center |align=left|Steve Yzerman||align=left|Detroit Red Wings||18||8||12||20||-1||4 |-align=center |align=left|Sergei Fedorov||align=left|Detroit Red Wings||19||2||18||20||+8||10 |-align=center |align=left|Sandis Ozolinsh||align=left|Colorado Avalanche||22||5||14||19||+5||16 |-align=center |align=left|Dave Lowry||align=left|Florida Panthers||22||10||7||17||+8||39 |} ===Goaltenders=== This is a combined table of the top five goaltenders based on goals against average and the top five goaltenders based on save percentage, with at least 420 minutes played.
