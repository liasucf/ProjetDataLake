    "text": "The Dissociatives were an Australian band consisting of Daniel Johns of Silverchair, Australian dance producer DJ Paul Mac, and touring members Julian Hamilton and Kim Moyes from Sydney electronic duo \"The Presets\", and James Haselwood. Their first single \"Somewhere Down the Barrel\" was released in March 2004 and peaked at number 25. The debut album The Dissociatives was released on 4 April 2004. ==I Can't Believe It's Not Rock== Daniel Johns and Paul Mac met in 1997 when Paul Mac remixed \"Freak\" from Silverchair's Freak Show album. The two became friends and Paul Mac worked on the subsequent Silverchair albums Neon Ballroom, Diorama, and Young Modern. The two worked on the experimental I Can't Believe It's Not Rock EP released in 2000. ==The making of The Dissociatives album== In mid-2003, Daniel Johns and Paul Mac got together to produce the album, recording the basic tracks in London, and finishing it off in Sydney and Newcastle. The pair produced all the instrumental tracks and vocals themselves with Johns writing the lyrics and recording them in Newcastle. The pair described the music and lyrics in the April 2004 Australian edition of Rolling Stone. \"The music is, for me, a combination of excitement, happiness, rambunctiousness and viciousness, done to whimsy,\" Johns said. \"I'd add with a hint of melancholy, but it's more outweighed by joy,\" added Mac. The pair, in an interview on Rove Live in 2004, said that the musical journey of The Dissociatives is \"definitely not a side project\" and that they plan to release more interesting and groundbreaking music in the future under this guise. However, the band have been on hiatus since 2005 due to work with other projects (Silverchair, The Presets, and more recently Johns' solo work), and have not publicly stated plans for future albums or performances. ==Discography and appearances== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" |+ List of studio albums, with selected chart positions and certifications ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Certifications |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| AUS |- ! scope=\"row\"| The Dissociatives | * Released: 5 April 2004 * Label: Eleven: A Music Company (ELEVENCD23) * Formats: CD | 12 | * ARIA: Gold |} ===Extended plays=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" border=\"1\" |+ List of Extended plays ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Album details |- ! scope=\"row\"| I Can't Believe It's Not Rock | *Released: December 2000 *Label: Eleven: A Music Company *Format: CD |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" |+ List of singles, with selected chart positions and certifications ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:19em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:1em;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\" | Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font- size:90%;\"| AUS |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Somewhere Down the Barrel\" |rowspan=\"3\"| 2004 | 25 |rowspan=\"3\"|The Dissociatives |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Young Man, Old Man (You Ain't Better Than the Rest)\" | 46 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Horror with Eyeballs\" | 59 |- |} ===Other Appearances=== * Spicks and Specks (2005); performed and produced the title music for this Australian TV show, which is a reworked cover of the Bee Gees' first hit single of the same name ==Awards and nominations== ===ARIA Awards=== The Australian Recording Industry Association Music Awards (commonly known as ARIA Music Awards or ARIA Awards) is an annual series of awards nights celebrating the Australian music industry, presented by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). |- | rowspan=\"6\"|2004 ||rowspan=\"5\"| The Dissociatives || Album of the Year || |- | Best Group || |- | Best Pop Release || |- | Best Cover Art || |- | Daniel Johns & Paul Mac for The Dissociatives | Producer of the Year || |- | James Hackett for \"Somewhere Down the Barrel\" || Best Video || |- |2005 || Sydney Circa 2004/08 || ARIA Award for Best Music DVD || |- ===APRA Awards=== The APRA Music Awards are several award ceremonies run in Australia by Australasian Performing Right Association to recognise songwriting skills, sales and airplay performance by its members annually.
