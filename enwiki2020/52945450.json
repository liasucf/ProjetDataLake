    "text": "The Last Tasmanian is a 1978 documentary about the decline of Tasmania's Aboriginal people in the nineteenth century including through genocide by British colonists. The film was highly controversial in Australia, in particular for criticism by contemporary Aboriginal Tasmanians that the film suggested Tasmanian Aboriginal culture had been eradicated. The Last Tasmanian screened widely internationally to acclaim, including receiving a nomination for the Gold Hugo at the Chicago International Film Festival, and was sold to television in twenty-two countries. == References == == External links == * Category:English-language films Category:1978 documentary films Category:1978 films Category:Documentary films about Aboriginal Australians Category:Australian documentary films Category:Australian films ",
