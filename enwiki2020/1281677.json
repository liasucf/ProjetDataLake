    "text": "Regional map showing location of Hornsby in Mare Serenitatis Hornsby is a tiny lunar impact crater in the western part of the Mare Serenitatis, a lunar mare in the northeast quadrant of the Moon's near side. It was named after British astronomer Thomas Hornsby. It is a solitary formation that is located at least 100 kilometers from any significant craters, although the curiously shaped depression Aratus CA lies about 50 km to the west-northwest. To the north- northwest is Linn\u00e9, a feature notable for its skirt of high-albedo material. To the west of Hornsby is the wrinkle ridge Dorsum Von Cotta. ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== * LTO-42D1 Hornsby -- L&PI; topographic map Category:Impact craters on the Moon ",
