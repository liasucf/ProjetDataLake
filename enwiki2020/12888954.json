    "text": "Live at the Albert Hall is a live album by The Dubliners. It was their last recording for the Major Minor label. Recorded in 1968 and released in 1969, it contained live versions of some of their recent hits as well as a version of \"Whiskey on a Sunday\", which had been a big hit for Danny Doyle. The rebel ballad \"Off to Dublin in the Green\" was issued on early pressings of the album, but was later dropped. The album features the original band members. In November 2006, an edited version was released by EMI as a third disc as part of The Dubliners Platinum Collection. ==Track listing== All tracks Traditional; except where indicated ===Side One=== # \"Black Velvet Band\" # \"McAlpine's Fusiliers\" # \"Peggy Gordon\" # \"Weila Waile\" # \"Monto\" # \"Cork Hornpipe\" # \"Leaving of Liverpool\" ===Side Two=== # \"Whiskey on a Sunday\" (Glyn Hughes) # \"I Wish I Were Back in Liverpool\" (Leon Rosselson, Stan Kelly) # \"Flop-eared Mule\" # \"Navvy Boots\" # \"Whiskey in the Jar\" # \"Maids When You're Young Never Wed an Old Man\" # \"Seven Drunken Nights\" # \"Off to Dublin in the Green\" ==References== Category:Live albums recorded at the Royal Albert Hall Category:The Dubliners live albums Category:1969 live albums Category:Major Minor Records live albums ",
