    "text": "Lily Argent (8 October 1886 \u2013 13 December 1916), Lily Bumster from November 1913, was a petty criminal from Swansea, Wales. She grew up in a home in which drunkenness and crime were commonplace, and received her first criminal conviction at the age of 19. She was arrested for theft, along with fellow prostitutes Kate Driscoll and Selina Rushbrook, in 1905. She was found not guilty, and the experience appears to have deterred her from a life of crime; she instead became a prostitute. Following the death of her mother in 1906 Argent descended into alcoholism. In 1913 she married Michael John Bumster, the son of the owners of the boarding house in which she was living. The relationship was to be brief, as less than a year later her husband enlisted in the army on the outbreak of the First World War. Lily Bumster, by this time suffering severe tuberculosis, died in late 1916. In her lifetime, Argent attracted little notice beyond official records and local newspaper accounts. Her life was examined by local historian Elizabeth Belcham in her book Swansea's 'Bad Girls': Crime and Prostitution 1870s\u20131914. ==Early life== Lily Argent was born on 8 October 1886 in Swansea. Her parents were William Argent, a local stonemason, and Margaret Argent n\u00e9e Webb, a servant in an eating house in Cross Street, Swansea; the family lived in Madoc Street, Swansea. Lily was the second of the Argents' six children. Throughout Lily's childhood, Margaret Argent and her sisters Annie Price, Harriet Griffiths and Elizabeth Winter made regular appearances in the courts for alcohol-related public order offences. The young Lily Argent grew up in an environment in which drunkenness, crime and violence was commonplace. She made the first of her many appearances in court in October 1898, when she testified on behalf of her mother in a case in which labourer James Davies was accused of breaking Margaret Argent's leg; Davies denied the charges, claiming that Margaret Argent had sustained the injuries falling over while trying to attack him. ==Adult life== In August 1905, having moved out of the family home in the intervening years, the 19-year-old Lily Argent received her first criminal conviction, a prosecution for drunkenness. As was customary at the time for a first offence, she was discharged on condition she enter the local workhouse. Within weeks she was arrested again and given a 10s fine (about \u00a3 in terms) for fighting in the High Street. By this time she had been discharged from the workhouse and was lodging in The Strand in Swansea. As a young woman with no means of support these arrests did not discourage her from crime, and on 17 November that year she was arrested, along with her friends Selina Rushbrook and Catherine Driscoll (both well-known local thieves and prostitutes), for the theft of a sea captain's purse containing \u00a35 10s (about \u00a3 in terms). On this occasion, all three were found not guilty of the theft on grounds of insufficient evidence. It appears that this narrow escape finally turned Lily Argent away from a life of crime, and she was never again to be arrested for theft, although she continued to work as a prostitute. In 1906 Margaret Argent died from cerebral softening and eclampsia. Her daughter gradually became an alcoholic, and in May 1909, after not coming to the notice of the authorities for over three years, Lily Argent was again arrested for riotous behaviour and imprisoned for a month. She was arrested yet again for drunkenness in February and December 1910; on the latter occasion, the arresting officer described her as \"using most abusive and indecent language\". ==Marriage and death== By this time Argent was living in Michael and Margaret Bumster's boarding-house at 68 Strand, and continuing to work as a prostitute. Along with fellow prostitute Annie Boatwright, she was one of only two unmarried female boarders in an otherwise entirely male establishment. In November 1913 Argent married the Bumsters' son, Michael John Bumster. Their relationship was to be brief; on the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Michael John Bumster\u2014who had previous military training\u2014enlisted in the army. On 26 October 1914 Lily Bumster was again prosecuted for assault, the last of her arrests. On 13 December 1916, by this time suffering from severe tuberculosis, Lily Bumster died of cardiac failure, aged 30. She was buried, along with her parents, in the family plot in Danygraig cemetery. == See also == *Contagious Diseases Acts *Inebriates Act 1898 ==Notes== ==References== ===Bibliography=== * Category:Welsh female prostitutes Category:People from Swansea Category:20th- century Welsh criminals Category:1886 births Category:1916 deaths ",
