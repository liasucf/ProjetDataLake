She was re-elected in 2002 and 2007. In 2005, she was reportedly considered for the position of Deputy Prime Minister, but stated that she would not be interested in it. In August 2011, the government of Acting Prime Minister Sam Abal (standing in for Somare while the latter was hospitalised for a serious heart condition) was brought down by a parliamentary motion, and Dame Carol lost office.\"O'Neill is PM\", The National, 3 August 2011Cabinet of Papua New Guinea , CIA Factbook, 18 August 2011; accessed 10 August 2014. In January 2012, Dame Carol, a long-serving minister in the Somare government, distanced herself from those involved in attempts to overthrow current Prime Minister Peter O'Neill\u2019s government but stated that Somare's removal from power in August 2011 was illegal. At the same time, she announced her intention to sit as the opposition leader in parliament, in order to hold the Peter O'Neill-led government to account. Dame Carol proposed forming a one-woman opposition and, in the absence of other contenders, to be recognised as opposition leader. Somare's party refused to take up opposition seats so as not to concede the legitimacy of the Peter O'Neill government. On 15 February, Speaker Jeffrey Nape recognised her as leader of the Opposition, of which she was the only sitting member. She is the first woman to occupy that position. She stated she would use her remaining time in Parliament to consolidate the role of the Opposition for the future, hoping to obtain parliamentary staff for the Opposition, and a change in parliamentary procedures to strengthen it.\"Qld-born woman new PNG opposition leader\", AAP, 15 February 2012; accessed 10 August 2014. Dame Carol has been outspoken in her criticism of the controversial Judicial Conduct Law, rushed through by the O'Neill Government and Speaker Jeffrey Nape, which empowers the government to suspend judges. Questioning the judgment of the Speaker, Dame Carol has also called for a legislative reform that would require that the speaker be non-partisan and cannot be a serving MP. The Speaker accused her of contempt and targeted her for investigation. Dame Carol chose not to re- contest her seat of Moresby-South in the 2012 National Elections and retired from politics at the end of her third term in July 2012.
