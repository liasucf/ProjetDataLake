    "text": "right Anomalies, published in 1997 by Imperium Games, is an anthology of nine adventures for the science fiction role-playing game Traveller. ==Description== Anomlaies is a 112-page softcover book, with design by Marc Miller, editing by Tony Lee and cover art by Chris Foss. ==Plot summary== Anomalies includes nine loosely linked adventures that use the Traveller universe and rules system, including: * \"Lock and Loot\": the players try to prevent a renegade diplomat from enslaving a primitive civilization. * \"The Sleepers\" is set in a cyrogenics facility, and features followers of a death cult and deadly robots. * \"Dead Space\": the players confront a genetic experiment on a deserted research station. ==Reception== In the January 1998 edition of Dragon (Issue #243), Rick Swan called the collection \"a triumph, one of the best sci-fi anthologies I\u2019ve ever come across. Brilliantly staged, featuring compelling characters and jaw-dropping plot twists, every episode is a winner, and I'd be hard-pressed to pick my favorite.\" Swan did criticize the maps, which he found \"bland\"; he called the artwork \"so-so\"; and he found the \"pages of dense text are hard on the eyes.\" But he concluded by giving the book a top rating of 6 out of 6, saying, \"Nitpicks aside, Anomalies is a first-rate effort, absorbing, intelligent roleplaying of the highest caliber.\" ==References== Category:Traveller (role-playing game) adventures ",
