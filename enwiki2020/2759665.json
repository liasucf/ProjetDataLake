    "text": "The Dublin County Board of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) () or Dublin GAA is one of the 32 county boards of the GAA in Ireland, and is responsible for Gaelic games in the Dublin Region and the Dublin county teams. The teams and their fans are known as \"The Dubs\" or \"Boys in Blue\". The fans have a special affiliation with the Hill 16 end of Croke Park. ==Governance== Dublin GAA has jurisdiction over the area that is associated with the traditional county of Dublin. There are 9 officers on the Board, including the Cathaoirleach (Chairperson), Se\u00e1n Shanley. The Board is subject to the Leinster GAA Provincial Council. ===Notable officers=== The following members have also held notable positions in the GAA: *Tom Loftus, former Chairman of the Dublin County Board was appointed Vice Chairman of the GAA Leinster Council (1969\u20131972) and later Chairman of the GAA Leinster Council (1972\u20131974) *Three men from the Dublin GAA organisation have served as President of the GAA: **Daniel McCarthy, 1921\u20131924 **Se\u00e1n Ryan, 1928\u20131932 **Dr Joseph Stuart, 1958\u20131961 ===Clubs=== For details on the Board's clubs, see this category and the list of Gaelic games clubs in Ireland#Dublin. ===Restructuring=== The GAA conducted a review of the structure of the Dublin GAA organisation in 2002 because of the huge population inequities, and investigated the feasibility of dividing the County into more population-appropriate structures. Plans to divide Dublin into two teams \u2013 North Dublin and South Dublin \u2013 were proposed in 2002 but rejected by the Dublin County Board. Currently the Board has only decided to divide its development teams. These teams are not considered to be a move towards dividing the county but are in fact a move designed to identify and develop young talent for the County as a whole. The restructured developments teams are North, South and West. ==Crest and symbols== In 2003/4, the Dublin County Board tried unsuccessfully to copyright the Dublin crest in use at the time. The crest at the time was declared to be in the public domain by the Irish High Court as it was too similar to other crests in use by Dublin City Council and other Dublin sports bodies. In line with other county boards and in order to prevent further loss of revenue, the county board designed a new crest drawing from the county's historical past which could be copyrighted and registered as a trade mark. The symbolism of the crest is: three castles in flame which signifies the city of Dublin; a raven which signifies the county of Fingal; a Viking longboat which signifies the county of D\u00fan Laoghaire-Rathdown; a book which signifies the county of South Dublin. The name \u00c1th Cliath in Irish replaces the previous name \"Dublin\". ==Sponsorship== In October 2013, Dublin signed a new sponsorship deal with insurance firm AIG in excess of \u20ac4m over a five-year period. The deal would also incorporate ladies' football and camogie for the first time. ==Football== ===Clubs=== The Dublin Senior Football Championship is an annual club competition between the top Dublin clubs. The winners of the Dublin Championship qualify to represent their county in the Leinster Championship and in turn, go on to the All- Ireland Senior Club Football Championship. The current (2015) Dublin County Champions are Ballyboden St Enda's who claimed their first Dublin Senior Championship title. The first winners of the Dublin football championship were Erins Hope in 1887, who were the student club attached to St Patrick's Teacher Training College, Drumcondra. St Vincent's have won the most titles with a total of 26. The Dublin Intermediate Football Championship is the second tier football championship. The Intermediate champions go on to play in the Senior football Championship. The 2012 Dublin Intermediate County Champions are Cuala who became champions with a win over Fingallians. St Brigid's are the most successful intermediate club, having won on five occasions. Parnell Park hosts all the major games in the Dublin club football championships. ===County team=== Dublin against Tyrone in the 2013 National Football League Final Dublin first won the All-Ireland in 1891 beating Cork by a 2\u20131 to 1\u20131 margin. They won the All-Ireland the following year with victory over Kerry. The Dublin team of the 1970s won 4 All-Irelands (1974, 1976, 1977 and 1983) and won 7 Leinster titles (6 consecutively). They were also the first team to play in 6 All-Ireland Football Finals consecutively from 1974 to 1979, a feat later matched by Kerry in 2009. In the 2010s, Dublin produced the greatest teams in modern times. The Dubs won 7 championships in the decade and also five in a row, being one of the greatest decade any team can make. On 25 March 2017, when beating Roscommon by 2\u201329 to 0\u201314 in a National League game at Croke Park, Dublin set a new record of playing 35 games in League and Championship without defeat. The previous record, held by Kerry, had stood for 84 years. Dublin and Meath were involved in one of the most famous of Leinster championship encounters in 1991, the Dublin and Meath 4 consecutive ties. The teams had to go to three replays in their Leinster Senior Football Championship first round match before a winner could be found. This series of games had the added factor of the Dublin and Meath being long standing fierce rivals, a rivalry that was increased due to Meath winning the 4 out of the last 5 Leinster Championships and 2 All-Irelands over the previous 5 years to replace Dublin as the strongest team in Leinster. Meath eventually won the series thanks to a last minute goal scored by Kevin Foley, and a point scored by David Beggy, in the third replay. Foley took seven steps for the winning goal. ==Hurling== ===Clubs=== The Dublin Senior Hurling Championship is an annual club competition between the top Dublin clubs. The winners of the Dublin Championship qualify to represent their county in the Leinster Senior Club Hurling Championship and in turn, go on to the All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship. The 2013 Dublin County Champions were Ballyboden St. Enda's. The first winners of the Dublin hurling championship were Metropolitans in 1888. Faughs have won the most titles with a total of 31. The (2013) champions of the Dublin Minor Hurling Championship are Ballyboden St Endas. 2014 Champions were Croke's 2015 Champions were Cuala who were runners up in the Leinster Final 2016 Champions are Cuala who won the Leinster Final for the first time since Crumlin 79/80 Parnell Park hosts all the major games in the Dublin club hurling championships. ===County team=== Liam Rushe in action for the Dublin hurlers against Galway in the Allianz Hurling League Dublin's hurlers have failed to replicate the success of the county's football side, having won the Senior All-Ireland Hurling final on 6 occasions, most recently in 1938. In terms of All-Ireland titles, they are significantly behind hurling's big three of Kilkenny, Cork and Tipperary. Their six titles do however place them fifth in the overall winners list, jointly tied with Wexford. Dublin have won the Leinster Championship on 24 occasions, the second most Leinster titles of any side, although they remain well behind Kilkenny, who have won the Leinster Championship 70 times. Dublin have won the National Hurling League three times: in 1929, 1939 and 2011. This places them joint seventh (with Clare) on the overall winners list, having won 16 fewer titles than top-ranked Tipperary.http://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/gaa/ In 2009, former Clare manager, Anthony Daly was appointed manager of Dublin. Under his management, Dublin contested the Leinster Final, but lost by 2 goals to Kilkenny. Dublin won the National Hurling League in May 2011 after a 12-point win over Kilkenny, their first national title since they won the All Ireland in 1938. On 7 July 2013, they won the Leinster Final against Galway on a 2\u201325 to 2\u201313 scoreline, scoring 2\u201321 from play. This was the first time they had won this important competition since 1961. In a nice touch, the Goalkeeper from the 1961 team, presented Dublin Captain, Johnny McCaffrey with the Bob O'Keefe trophy. ==Handball== ===Hardball Singles winners=== Dublin have won the Senior hardball singles All-Ireland title on 15 occasions, two more than their nearest rivals Kilkenny. The 2005 All-Ireland senior hardball singles title was won by Dubliner Eoin Kennedy who plays his club handball for St Brigids. Other former winners for Dublin are T. Soye and A. Clarke. ===Softball Singles winners=== Dublin have won the Senior softball singles on nine occasions, more than any county other than Kilkenny (who have twenty-five wins to date). The former winners for Dublin include M. Joyce 1925, W. McGuire 1927, L. Rowe 1947, 1949 and 1951, P. Ryan 1980 and E. Kennedy 2004, 2005 and 2006. ==Camogie== Dublin are the most successful county in the women's field sport of camogie, During the period from 1932 to 1966 they had nearly one- third of the affiliated clubs in the Association and won all but eight of the championships they contested, winning a ten consecutively and an eight consecutively in a period interrupted only by a controversial 1956 All-Ireland semi-final defeat to Antrim. In a period of revival they won three National Camogie League titles in 1979\u20131983 and the 1984 All-Ireland Senior Camogie Championship. The total could have been greater had not Dublin County Board disaffiliated during two periods of unrest in the 1940s. Three Dublin clubs have won the All-Ireland Senior Club Camogie Championship, Austin Stacks (1971 and 1972), Eoghan Ruadh (1967), and Crumlin (1985). ===Structure=== The camogie structure in Dublin was arguably the most successful in the country and differed from its provincial counterparts. The league and championship were organised in the winter months, and weekly programmes of Dublin Senior Club Camogie League, Dublin Senior Club Camogie Championship and Isle of Man Cup matches were contested by clubs such as Austin Stacks, Celtic, CIE, Cuchulainns, Eoghan Ruadh, Jacobs, Muiris O'Neills, Naomh Aoife, and Optimists on a dedicated camogie ground in the Phoenix Park (first used 1922, reopened 1933, new pitch opened 1987) although Celtic had a ground in Coolock and CIE had a ground in Inchicore. This left Dublin camogie to concentrate on a summer closed season which contributed to its successes in the but led to difficulties when Dublin clubs began to compete in the provincial and All Ireland club championship in the 1960s. Although Celtic were the first winners of the All Ireland, they did not compete the following year. ===Notable players=== Notable players include team of the century members Eileen Duffy, Sophie Brack, Kay Mills and \u00dana O'Connor, player of the year award winners Alice Hussey and Yvonne Redmond, All Star award winnersAll-stars on camogie.ie Eimear Brannigan, Ciara Lucey and Louise O'Hara, and stars from the \"golden age\" such as Sophie Brack, Emmy Delaney, Kathleen Cody, Peggy Griffin, Doreen Rogers and Mary Walsh. ===Administrators=== M\u00e1ire N\u00ed Chinn\u00e9ide, M\u00e1ire Gill, Eilish Redmond, Nell McCarthy, \u00dana U\u00ed Phuirs\u00e9il, Br\u00edd\u00edn U\u00ed Mhaolag\u00e1in and Phyllis Breslin have served as presidents of the Camogie Association). ===Expansion=== Under Camogie's National Development Plan 2010\u20132015, \"Our Game, Our Passion\",Irish Independent 29 March 2010: Final goal for camogie five new camogie clubs were to be established in the county by 2015.National Development Plan 2010\u20132015, Our Game, Our Passion information page on camogie.ie, pdf download (778k) from Camogie.ie download site ==Ladies' football== ==Rivalries== In Gaelic football, Dublin's biggest rivalry has been with nearby Meath. Both counties were the strongest sides from Leinster during the 1970s and 1980s. The 1991 four-game tie added to the intensity between the two counties. The Dublin football team also share a rivalry with neighbours Kildare. Lesser local rivalries exist with nearby Wicklow, Laois and Westmeath. On a national level Dublin's rivalry with Kerry is one of Ireland's most renowned. The rivalry between the two counties intensified in the 1970s and early 1980s. Other smaller footballing rivalries have developed over the decades between Dublin and teams such as Cork, Tyrone, Donegal and Galway, who Dublin played in the 1983 Final known as the Game of Shame. The Dublin hurling team share lesser rivalries with fellow provincial sides Kilkenny, Offaly and Wexford. ==See also== * The Dubs \u2013 Dublin GAA since the 1940s ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Gaelic games governing bodies in Leinster Category:Leinster GAA Category:Sport in County Dublin ",
