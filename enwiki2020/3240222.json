    "text": "\"Girl Talk\" is a song by American group TLC. It was written by band members Lisa Lopes and Tionne Watkins along with Anita McLoud, Edmund \"Eddie Hustle\" Clement, and Kandi Burruss for the group's fourth studio album, 3D (2002). Featuring production by Hustle, it was released as the album's lead single in September 2002, along with a previously unreleased song \"Get Away\". While the song contains vocals by Lopes, the music video for \"Girl Talk\" marked the band's first release without Lopes, following her death in April of the same year. Upon its release, \"Girl Talk\" reached number twenty-three on the US Billboards Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart and number twenty-eight on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the group's 12th top forty entry on the latter chart. In addition, the song reached the top twenty in Denmark and New Zealand, the top thirty in the UK and the top fifty in Australia. The song appears in the Nintendo Gamecube and Xbox game Freestyle Street Soccer. ==Release== The international maxi singles were released with a B-side track entitled \"Get Away\", written by band member Tionne Watkins and Ray Murray. The song was later featured on the Japanese imported version of \"3D\", and is often praised as a fan favorite. ==Music video== The music video was directed by Dave Meyers and filmed in late October 2002, six months after Lisa Lopes' death. The video depicts the two remaining members, T-Boz & Chilli, in three different locations; The Dirty South, Tokyo and Africa, dancing and talking with other girls, representing how girls all over the world \"talk\". An animated segment is used during Left Eye's rap verse, where all three girls appear as cartoon versions of themselves. The video ends with a tribute to Left Eye, reading: \"In Loving Memory of Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes.\" ==Track listing== ;European, Australian, South African, and Japanese CD maxi single # \"Girl Talk\" (radio mix) \u2013 3:37 # \"Girl Talk\" (Jacknife Lee Remix) \u2013 3:50 # \"Girl Talk\" (Kidstuff Vocal Mix) \u2013 7:53 # \"Get Away\" \u2013 4:14 ;UK CD single 1, UK 12\" single # \"Girl Talk\" (radio mix) \u2013 3:37 # \"Girl Talk\" (Jacknife Lee Remix) \u2013 3:50 # \"Girl Talk\" (Kidstuff Vocal Mix) \u2013 7:53 ;UK CD single 2 # \"Girl Talk\" (radio mix) \u2013 3:37 # \"Waterfalls\" \u2013 4:36 # \"No Scrubs\" \u2013 3:39 ;European CD single # \"Girl Talk\" (radio mix) \u2013 3:37 # \"Girl Talk\" (Jacknife Lee Remix) \u2013 3:50 ;US 12\" single :A1. \"Girl Talk\" (radio mix) \u2013 3:37 :A2. \"Girl Talk\" (instrumental) \u2013 3:34 :B1. \"Girl Talk\" (radio mix) \u2013 3:37 :B2. \"Girl Talk\" (a cappella) \u2013 3:17 ;US DVD single # \"Hands Up\" (music video) \u2013 4:01 # \"Girl Talk\" (music video) \u2013 3:43 # Photo gallery slideshow \u2013 0:32 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
