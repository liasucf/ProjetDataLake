There are several lovely empty beaches nearby. The Bettyhill Hotel contains the Eilean Neave restaurant. The Farr Bay Inn, built in 1819, was formerly the manse and is now a listed building. It has recently come under new management and was refurbished in 2009. Bettyhill holds an annual football competition called the Guy Cup. Teams from nearby northern areas come to compete for the trophy. This annual gathering is held in remembrance of Philip Mackay (nicknamed \"Guy\") who died in an oil rig accident. The medals and trophy are usually held by Guy's mother Phyllis Mackay. ==References== == External links == * * Category:Populated places in Sutherland Bettyhill ",
