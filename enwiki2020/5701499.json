    "text": "\"Goodbye\" was the Bosnian and Herzegovinian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1997, performed in Bosnian (despite the English of the title) by Alma \u010card\u017ei\u0107. Written and composed by Mili\u0107 Vuka\u0161inovi\u0107, the song was performed 14th on the night, following Estonia's Maarja with \"Keelatud maa\" and preceding Portugal's C\u00e9lia Lawson with \"Antes do adeus\". The uptempo song's lyrics are a plea from the singer to her lover not to end their relationship. She suggests a series of things which he could do, just as long as he doesn't \"say the two words, which mean it's over\" (the two words being \"Goodbye, darling\" - \"Zbogom ljubavi\" in Bosnian). Due to the expansion of the Contest, the 1998 Contest was only open to countries with high average placings - and Bosnia and Herzegovina's entry did not achieve such. Thus, the song was replaced as Bosnian and Herzegovinian representative in the 1999 Contest by Dino and B\u00e9atrice with \"Putnici\".
