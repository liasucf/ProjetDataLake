    "text": "G\u00e9rard Charasse (born 26 March 1944 in Le Vernet, Allier) was a member of the National Assembly of France. He represented Allier's 4th constituency (from 1997 to 2012). Then major boundary changes in 2011 reduced Allier's parliamentary entitlement from 4 constituencies down to 3 - the old 3rd constituency was in effect abolished, its name and substantially its place being taken over by the pre-2012 4th constituency. Charasse then successfully took the 3rd constituency (from 2012 to 2017). He was a member of the Radical Party of the Left; he lost his seat in the 2017 Parliamentary Elections. ==References== Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:People from Allier Category:Politicians from Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes Category:Radical Party of the Left politicians Category:Deputies of the 11th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:Deputies of the 12th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:Deputies of the 13th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:Deputies of the 14th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic ",
