Regarded as one of the greatest South Korean strikers of all time, Choi was proficient at controlling the ball with various skills, including shooting, dribbling, touch and passing, and also had rapid speed, wide vision and supple body. He normally played as a striker, but he could also play as an attacking midfielder who creates chances. == International career == Choi was named in the South Korea squad for the 1980 AFC Asian Cup. He scored seven goals including two goals against Kuwait, and a hat-trick against United Arab Emirates in the group stage. South Korea met Kuwait again at the final, but they lost this time. He became the youngest top scorer at age 18 in the history of the AFC Asian Cup. In March 1981, he won the 1980 AFC Youth Championship, in which he scored four goals, with the South Korea under-20 team. In the same year, he also played at the 1981 FIFA World Youth Championship, and defeated Italy 4\u20131 in the group stage by recording two goals and two assists. He was selected for the South Korea squad for the 1986 FIFA World Cup. He contributed more than half of team's 17 goals with one goal and eight assists in eight games of the qualification. He recorded two assists and a goal, scored outside the penalty area against Italy, in the group stage. After the World Youth Championship, a Serie A club Juventus was interested in Choi, but his team Pohang consistently rejected their offer, although their interest lasted until the end of the 1986 World Cup. == Career statistics == === Club === Source: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! rowspan=2 | Club ! rowspan=2 | Season ! colspan=3 | League ! colspan=2 | National Cup ! colspan=2 | League Cup ! colspan=2 | Total |- !
