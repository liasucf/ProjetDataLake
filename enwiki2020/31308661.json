The unit saw little action during the War, but still had notable moments. 1st Squadron was patrolling near a town named Scherpenseel in Holland where they were ambushed by a German artillery unit. They were pinned down until SSG Briles laid down heavy machine gun fire. This suppressive fire resulted in multiple German casualties and surrenders . SSG Briles was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions. The next time that the 1st Squadron, 89th Cavalry Regiment had a notable deployment was in 2006 to Iraq. During this fifteen-month deployment, soldiers of the 1st Squadron killed and captured over 200 High-Value Targets (HVT). 1st Squadron also seized 57 major weapons caches, which helped their fight against the Iraqi Insurgency. 1st Squadron, 89th Cavalry Regiment returned to Iraq in 2009. This deployment included training the Iraqi Police, incapacitating HVT's, and raiding known insurgence hideouts and weapon caches. 3rd Squadron History Shortly after D-DAY, the 3rd Squadron, 89th Cavalry Regiment (then known as the 899th Tank Destroyer Battalion) received a mission in the town of St. Vith. Allied troops discovered German soldiers patrolling near the town. 3rd Squadron's job was to secure the perimeter of the town. While setting up a secure perimeter, German soldiers were spotted. 3rd Squadron and its allies developed a plan to counterattack the Germans. The Germans took out many tanks and had an advantageous high ground position against the dismounted patrol of 3rd Squadron. The Cavalry machine gunners laid down heavy suppressive fire to allow all the allied forces to bound backwards. 3rd Squadron was assigned to a town named Beaufort in December 1944. American forces were under attack so 3rd Squadron was sent as reinforcement. German forces had a heavy presence in Beaufort, patrolling nearly every road. The Squadron suffered many casualties due to an attack from patrolling German unit. 3rd Squadron returned to France after receiving heavy casualties. While in France they performed Military Police duties. Many activation's and deactivation's restricted the unit from deploying again until 2006 in Iraq. The most recent deployment was in 2015 in Afghanistan. They are still active to this day and serve in our country's modern day combat zones. ==Lineage== Constituted 1 June 1940 in the Regular Army as the 10th Antitank Battalion. * Redesignated 99th Antitank Battalion, 11 June 1940. * Redesignated 99th Infantry Battalion (Antitank) and activated at Fort Lewis Wa. 1 July 1940. * Redesignated 99th Infantry Antitank Battalion, 24 July 1941. * Redesignated 899th Tank Destroyer Battalion 15 December 1941. * Inactivated 27 December 1945 at Camp Kilmer NJ. * Redesignated 899th Tank Battalion, 23 July 1953 * Activated 17 January 1955 in Germany. * Inactivated 1 May 1958 in Germany. * Designated to 89th Cavalry Regiment on 30 March 2004.
