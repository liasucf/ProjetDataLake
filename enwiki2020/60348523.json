He had a key role in the events of the Romanian Revolution of December 1989 and in exposing the human rights abuses of the Ceau\u0219escu regime. ==Professional career== Mazilu was born in Bac\u0103u. In 1952, he graduated from the Technical School of Engineers in Bac\u0103u. The same year, he became a security officer and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. In 1959, Mazilu graduated from the University of Bucharest with a law degree, obtaining a PhD in the same field in 1964. As Mazilu attempted to obtain a PhD, he worked as a professor of law at \u0218tefan Gheorghiu Academy in Bucharest. From 1965\u20131966, Mazilu served as Director of Securitate in B\u0103neasa.Actuala Academie de Poli\u021bie Alexandru Ioan Cuza, la care va continua s\u0103 predea \u0219i dup\u0103 1989, din 1999 \u00een 2011 According to the Report Armageddon VII of 2004, it is claimed that Dumitru Mazilu had been dismissed from the management of Securitate officers as a result of an attempt to falsify documents relating to a car accident. From 1965\u20131968, Mazilu was responsible for investigating abuses and irregularities committed during the regime of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej. In the 1970s, Mazilu's academic career further expanded. In 1970, he was established as a university professor by the Ministry of Education. In the years 1970\u20131974, he was the scientific director of the Institute of Political Sciences in Bucharest. In 1974, he gained admiration from American universities such as Harvard, Columbia and UCB. This attention from foreign institutes solidified Mazilu's position in Romanian diplomacy. This led to Mazilu's position as a legal adviser at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. ==Political dissidence in Ceau\u0219escu's Romania== In 1985, Mazilu became involved in discussions of human rights and of the youth of the world. At this point in time, expectations that Mazilu wrote a report critical of the situation of human rights in Romania. Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu was informed by secret services that Mazilu intended to publish the report. Ceau\u0219escu forbade Mazilu to leave the country in order to prevent him from presenting the report to the United Nations Organization. The report detailed Ceau\u0219escu's policy of exporting the majority of Romania's food, and lowering living standards in order to quickly pay off foreign debts. This was the case especially for those who lived near the construction site of Ceau\u0219escu's planned place who were forcefully placed into hastily constructed apartment blocks that lacked electricity and running water, when in contrast, Ceau\u0219escu lived in extravagant wealth. Mazilu furthered criticized Ceau\u0219escu's agricultural policy of destroying traditional farming centers in an effort to modernize Romania's farming industry with the introduction of more modern agricultural centers, claiming that this compromised peasant farmers as their farms were seen by Ceau\u0219escu's administration as \"breeding (grounds) of bourgeois liberalism that still (perpetuate) forms of private property\"https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/30/world/smuggled-rights-report- indicts-ceausescu.html. From the years 1986\u20131989, Mazilu was placed under house arrest as a result of his criticisms of Ceau\u0219escu's handling of human rights. As a result of Mazilu's critical report of Human Rights in Romania, he was formally fired from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1987 and his diplomatic passport was withdrawn, preventing him from attending UN meetings. In May of the same year, Ceau\u0219escu had a letter written to the UN which claimed that Mazilu had suffered a heart attack and was seriously ill.United Nations Chronicle nr. 4/1998 - Defending ... The Universal Declaration of Human Rights Dumitru Mazilu wrote a letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations stating that he had been hospitalized twice, being forced to withdraw from a summit on 1 December 1987, stating that he would not withdraw his report. The next year, the UN Subcommission to request Mazilu's release. In response, Ceau\u0219escu stated that Mazilu's detention was in accordance with Romanian law and that placing Mazilu on the diplomat list was redundant due to his illness, thus denying the requests of the UN. However, despite being under house arrest, Mazilu was able to publish a clandestine report to the Geneva in April 1989. The report was published by the United Nations in July of the same year. This report was similarly critical, stressing conditions of extreme hunger, cold and fear in Romania . Despite repeated attempts by the UN to free Mazilu, he remained under house arrest. In September 1989, four diplomats from the embassy of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, the United States of America and Canada were prevented by the Securitate to visit Mazilu. Several radio stations including the BBC, Deutsche Welle and Radio France Internationale brought attention to the situation. The United Nations eventually decided to take the situation to the International Court of Justice in the Hague.Secretarul General al Na\u021biunilor Unite c\u0103tre Pre\u0219edintele Cur\u021bii Interna\u021bionale de Justi\u021bie de la Haga : \u00cenaintare a unei cereri de Aviz consultativ \u00een cazul Dumitru Mazilu The subsequent hearing was held in October 1989 and in December 1989, Decision No 81/15 demanded that the Romanian authorities release Mazilu immediately and was voted upon unanimously, underling that Mazilu was to enjoy the diplomatic immunity of the United Nations as provided by Article 22 of the UN Convention on the privileges and immunities. ==During the Romanian Revolution== On the night of December 21, in the midst of the Romanian Revolution, Mazilu was moved to prison along with his wife and son by the Securitate. The following day, after the Ceau\u0219escu regime was overthrown and Mazilu and his family were released. The same day, Mazilu gave a speech at the government building now occupied by the National Salvation Front lead by Ion Iliescu detailing his opposition to CommunismAlex Mihai Stoenescu - Istoria loviturilor de stat \u00een Rom\u00e2nia, vol. IV, partea a II-a (Editura RAO, 2006) . ANTICOMMUNISM-Speech Mazilu (left) with Petre Roman (right) and Ion Iliescu (Centre). Mazilu proposed the following points of civic reform:Decembrie '89 - Grupul lui Mazilu, 12 decembrie 2005, Alex Mihai Stoenescu, Jurnalul Na\u021bional, accesat la 3 iulie 2012REVOLUTIA ROMANA - Proclamatia Revolutiei, Trilulilu *The abandonment of a single party state and the bringing about a democratic system with various present systems of government. *The organization of free elections in the shortest possible time. *Separation of legislative, executive and judicial powers in the state and the choice of all political leaders for one or not more than two mandates, respectively for five or ten years.

After his speech was broadcast on television, Dumitru Mazilu was appointed Vice President of the National Salvation Front, which took power after Ceau\u0219escu's removal. The FSN proclamation read by Ion Iliescu on the 22 of December 1989 was written by Dumitru Mazilu with some editing by Silviu Brucan. Despite this brief cooperation, tensions between Mazilu and Iliescu began as a result of the big tent ideology adopted by the FSN to present a united front against Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu. Brucan and Iliescu believed that Communism should be kept in place, but Ceau\u0219escu should be removed, whereas Mazilu believed that Communism was inherently flawed and was in need of replacement by Capitalism and Petre Roman believed that Socialism was Communism's natural replacement. These tensions culminated when during a march of remembrance for the fallen of the revolution on January 12, 1990, Mazilu attempted to use the dissatisfaction of the crowd to seize leadership of the FSN from Iliescu. His attempt, which included him jumping on top of a tank and shouting, \"death to the former Securitate officers!\" was largely unsuccessful apart from the removal of a few former Communist activists from the leadership of the FSN. After Dumitru Mazilu's failure to gain prominence as a leader in the National Salvation Front, the newspaper, Free Romania published a piece made up of information from Mazilu's political biography. The information in the piece was largely about his past under the regime of Gheorghe Gheorghiu- Dej. After being discredited from public opinion, Mazilu resigned from the leadership of the FSN on January 26, 1990, accusing the Communist practices within the political framework of the new political power of Stalinism. In March 1991, Dumitru Mazilu was attacked in Geneva during the devastation of political parties in Bucharest, the assaults of various journalists and leaders of the opposition, and the murder of Ioan Petru Culianu in Illinois. The murder was celebrated by the new union of the Romanian far-right and far- left;Antohi; Savin; Tism\u0103neanu, \"Cei pe care...\" according to Vladimir Tism\u0103neanu: \"[Culianu] he gave the most devastating indictment of the new union of far left and far right in Romania\". As speculation that former Securitate officers were behind the assaults of various journalists and opposition leaders and Ioan Petru Culianu's murder,Anton, Ted. \"The Killing of Professor Culianu\", in Lingua Franca, Volume 2, No. 6 - September/October 1992 Mazilu came to understand that the Romanian authorities were likely behind his assault and were attempting to keep him silent as a centre-left political dissident who was critical of both far-right and far-left world views. ==Post- Revolution activity== After the revolution, Mazilu left for a time to Switzerland. In 1990, he was chosen as the chairman of the Romanian Institute for Human Rights and youth, reprising the duties of a role that he held previously toward the early days of his career. In the years 1991\u20131993, Mazilu won a lawsuit filed by the Romanian authorities regarding his improper firing from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs during the Ceau\u0219escu regime. He obtained his previously held role which he had lost in 1986 at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Dumitru Mazilu was appointed as ambassador to the international organizations in Vienna, and later, Romania's representative to OSCE from 1994\u20131997. This saw another surge in Mazilu's diplomatic career. He held various positions of power including vice president of the United Nations Organization for the Development of Industry in 1995, vice president of the United Nations Commission for the peaceful uses of the cosmic space from 1995\u20131997, the chairman of the Working Group of the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency from 1996\u20131997, vice president and president of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law from 1998\u20132000, member of the International Diplomatic Academy in 2002.
