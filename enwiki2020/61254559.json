Shanghai ranked among the top 5 global science cities by scientific research outputs, measured by the Nature Index. A number of China's most prestigious universities entering global university rankings are based in Shanghai, including Fudan University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Tongji University, East China Normal University (these universities are selected as \"985 universities\" by the Chinese Government in order to build world-class universities). In 2002, Fudan University established a joint EMBA program with Washington University in St. Louis, which has since been consistently ranked as one of the best in the world. In 2012, NYU Shanghai was established in Pudong by New York University in partnership with East China Normal University as the first Sino-US joint venture university. In 2013 the Shanghai Municipality and the Chinese Academy of Sciences founded the ShanghaiTech University in the Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park in Pudong. This new research university is aiming to be a first-class institution on a national and international level.Rouhi, Maureen (19 January 2015). \"ShanghaiTech Aims To Raise The Bar For Higher Education In China\" . Chemical & Engineering News. Retrieved on 19 November 2015. The cadre school China Executive Leadership Academy in Pudong is also located in Shanghai, as well as the China Europe International Business School. Historically Shanghai was a center of higher education. In 1949 it, which at the time held 1.43% of the people in the country, had 41 institutions of higher education, 20% of the country's total number of such.Mak, Grace C. L. and Leslie N. K.

CITED: p. 378. ==Primary and secondary education== Shanghai Jiao Tong University Library The city government's education agency is the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission. Children with foreign passports are permitted to attend any public school in Shanghai. Prior to 2007 they were permitted to attend 150 select public schools. In 2006 about 2,000 non-Chinese nationals under 18 years of age attended Shanghai public schools.\"Neighborhood Schools Open to Foreign Kids \" (Archive). Shanghai Daily at China.org.cn. 9 December 2006. Retrieved 16 July 2015. Students with Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi (HSK) above 3 or 4 may attend public schools using Mandarin Chinese as the medium of instruction, while students below HSK 3\u20134 may attend international divisions of public schools or private international schools.Lau, Jessie. \"Shanghai international schools are priced beyond the reach of many expats \" (print title: \"International schools out of reach for many\"). South China Morning Post. Sunday 13 September 2015. Retrieved on 14 September 2015. Shanghai ranked first in the 2009 and 2012 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), a worldwide study of academic performance of 15-year-old students conducted by the OECD. Shanghai students, including migrant children, scored highest in every aspect (math, reading and science) in the world. The study concludes that public-funded schools in Shanghai have the highest educational quality in the world. Critics of PISA results counter that, in Shanghai and other Chinese cities, most children of migrant workers can only attend city schools up to the ninth grade, and must return to their parents' hometowns for high school due to hukou restrictions, thus skewing the composition of the city's high school students in favor of wealthier local families.Gao, Helen (23 January 2014), \"Shanghai Test Scores and the Mystery of the Missing Children\" , The New York Times. For Schleicher's response to these criticisms see his post, \"Are the Chinese Cheating in PISA Or Are We Cheating Ourselves?\" on the OECD's website blog, Education Today, 10 December 2013. The 2010 census shows that out of Shanghai's total population, 22.0% had a college education, double the level from 2000, while 21.0% had high school, 36.5% middle school, and 1.35% primary school education. 2.74% of residents age 15 and older were illiterate. Shanghai has more than 930 kindergartens, 1,200 primary and 850 middle schools. Over 760,000 middle schools students and 871,000 primary school students are taught by 76,000 and 64,000 teaching staff respectively. The city government has a financing scheme meant to spread resources to lower income areas by collecting taxes from all areas and then redistributing the money according to need.Liang, Xiaoyan, Huma Kidwai, Minxuan Zhang, and Yinan Zhang.

DOI: 10.1596/978-1-4648-0790-9. ===History=== In the late Qing Dynasty, school districts were introduced into Shanghai, allowing for communities to set local education policies and making education more common. By 1936, 59% of children total were enrolled in educational institutions; of those enrolled in school, about two-thirds were boys and the rest were girls. Grace C. L. Mak and Leslie N. K. Lo, authors of \"Education,\" wrote that education in the city was \"way ahead the rest of China\" in 1949 although those standards would have been \"weak\" in 1996. Virtually all children of primary school age in urban areas in the city were enrolled in school by 1958, and by 1983 the same went for children of those ages in rural areas of Shanghai Municipality. Shanghai was the first city in the country to implement 9-year mandatory education consisting of elementary school and junior high school.Zhang, Xu, and Sun, p. 143. The city previously designated \"key schools\" or favored schools which received more resources than others, but ended the system in 1994.Liang, Xiaoyan, Huma Kidwai, Minxuan Zhang, and Yinan Zhang.

A third party management system called \"entrusted management\", in which low performing schools received outside management, was given trials in 2005 and permanently established in 2007.Liang, Xiaoyan, Huma Kidwai, Minxuan Zhang, and Yinan Zhang.

DOI: 10.1596/978-1-4648-0790-9. ===International schools=== Shanghai had about 20 international schools. As of 2015 Shanghai has the largest number of international schools of any city in China. In November 2015 Christopher Cottrell of the state-run tabloid Global Times wrote that Shanghai \"prides itself on its international schools\".Cottrell, Christopher. \"Elitist international schools biased against local hires .\" Global Times. 8 November 2015.
