After the war and collapse of Austria-Hungary, in 1919 he became labour policy commissioner in local Zagreb government. As an avid Social Democrat, he was member of various left-wing and Marxist parties and wrote many articles about labour and social issues. His views gradually shifted towards Communism and in 1934 he joined Communist Party of Yugoslavia. Because of that he was often arrested, the last such occasion being in March 1941, only days before the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. When Yugoslavia collapsed and the Nazi puppet state of Independent State of Croatia was established few weeks later, Ad\u017eija was kept in the Kerestinec prison together with many other members of Croatian left-wing intelligentsia. The Usta\u0161a authorities had Ad\u017eija shot - together with Zvonimir Richtmann, Otokar Ker\u0161ovani and Ognjen Prica - as a retaliation for Partisan activity. Ad\u017eija posthumously received the title of People's Hero of Yugoslavia. ==Sources== * Bo\u017eidar Ad\u017eija Category:1890 births Category:1941 deaths Category:People from Drni\u0161 Category:People from the Kingdom of Dalmatia Category:Serbs of Croatia Category:League of Communists of Croatia politicians Category:Austro-Hungarian military personnel of World War I Category:Croatian people of World War II Category:Yugoslav civilians killed in World War II Category:People executed by the Independent State of Croatia Category:Recipients of the Order of the People's Hero ",
