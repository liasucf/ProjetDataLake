Castro is an outspoken advocate for the LGBT+ community and has publicly stated that she will fight for their rights even if it means going against her own family. Castro is widely known as one of the main drivers for the fight for acceptance of the LGBT+ community, especially in Latin American countries\u2014most notably, Cuba\u2014as well as dissolving some of the antiquated stigmas and stereotypes that surround the community. She is the daughter of Communist Party First Secretary Ra\u00fal Castro and feminist and revolutionary Vilma Esp\u00edn, and the niece of former First Secretary Fidel Castro. ==Early life== Mariela Castro at the 2010 Pride parade in Hamburg Mariela Castro is the daughter of Communist Party First Secretary Ra\u00fal Castro and feminist and revolutionary Vilma Esp\u00edn, and the niece of former First Secretary and prominent Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro. She has a brother, Alejandro Castro Esp\u00edn. Castro states that as a child, she grew up in a homophobic society where members of the LGBT+ community were targeted relentlessly in terms of both law and policy and societal standards and traditional expectations. Castro stated later in life that she and her peers would \u201claugh at gays, make fun of them\u201d. In the 1960s, members of the LGBT+ community were directly attacked and even placed in internment, or concentration camps . After speaking with some of her friends in the LGBT+ community, however, she gained a newfound awareness of the issues they face. Mariela Castro's father, Raul Castro ==Career== Castro modeled the Cuban National Center for Sex Education after the Federation of Cuban Women, which was established by her mother in 1960. The Federation of Cuban Women, along with other organizations at the time, was created as a result of women and other members of marginalized groups expressing their readiness to be involved in social change. One of their major efforts included a proposal for a change to the government family code that defined marriage as a union between two people, regardless of gender. Castro once stated in an interview that the federation \"spearheaded efforts to confront machismo in many arenas.\" After the Federation was established, the public, economic, and social position of women in Cuba at the time rose dramatically - employment and equal pay opportunities for women arose, as well as maternity leave and the concept of social security for women. In 1996, along with the Cuban Ministries of Education (MINED), the Cuban National Center for Sex Education created a National Sex Education Program for Cuban schools to teach children about sex in terms of procreation and as a means of pleasure and holistic well-being, gender equality, sexual violence, and sexually transmitted infections.
