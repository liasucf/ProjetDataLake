    "text": "Evacanthinae is a subfamily in the family Cicadellidae (leafhoppers). ==Description== This subfamily has very diverse members, some of which look very different from each other. They are somewhat moderate in shape and size when compared to other members of Cicadellidae and do not present many extremes in terms of slenderness or robustness. ==Distribution== Members of Evacanthinae are found worldwide and are on every continent except for Antarctica. ==Tribes and genera== There are four tribes in the subfamily, some of which were subfamilies of their own. ===Balbillini=== Erected by Baker in 1923.
