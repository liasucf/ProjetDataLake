Handbook of British Chronology p. 221 Wilfrid has occasionally been regarded as a previous bishop of the South Saxons, but this is an insertion of his name into the episcopal lists by later medieval writers, and Wilfrid was not considered the bishop during his lifetime or Bede's.Kelly Charters of Selsey pp. lxi\u2013lxiiBede, Ecclesiastical History of the English People Book IV.13. Referring to the land grant at Selsey, Bede wrote: \"Wilfrid..having built a monastery there established the regular life, most of the monks being his own companions..\" As abbot Eadberht received, around 700, a grant of land from Bryni, Ealdorman of Sussex, that was witnessed by Kings Nothelm of Sussex and Watt of Sussex.Anglo-Saxon Charters S1173 accessed on 25 August 2007 In a charter dated by Birch about 725, Eadberht was named as the beneficiary of land from King Nothelm, witnessed by King Watt.Birch Cartularium Saxonicum p. 211Kelly Charters of Selsey p. 26. Birch's emendation (of the date) to 725 is still unsatisfactory since it is too late for Bishop Eadberht.Anglo-Saxon Charters S43 accessed on 25 August 2007 But this charter is now believed to be a forgery from the late 10th century or early 11th century.Kelly Charters of Selsey p. 26. \"..is without doubt a forgery and not an innocent 10th century copy of a genuine eighth- century charter\"Diocese of Chichester Capitular Records for Cap.

Accessed 22 February 2010 Eadberht also appears as a witness to an undated charter of Nothelm, together with Osric and Eolla.
