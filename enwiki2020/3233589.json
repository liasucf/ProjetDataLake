Taking advantage of the Homestead Act of 1862, she acquired of land north of Phoenix and opened the Clouse Ranch, which quickly became a popular Christian retreat destination. Clouse died in 1959, leaving of the ranch to the Arizona Southern Baptist Convention, which it used to create a new Christian college. Founded in 1960 as Southwestern Conservative Baptist Bible College, Arizona Christian University's original campus was located at 2625 E. Cactus Road, on the northern edge of Phoenix. Since its founding, the university has undergone a number of name changes, including Southwestern College, until its name was finally changed to Arizona Christian University in January 2011 in recognition of its growth from a small Bible college to a Christian liberal arts university. Previously, the university was affiliated with the Conservative Baptist Convention until the university made the decision in 2009 to transition to a non-denominational Christian liberal arts university. ACU is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, a commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. During the HLC's 2012 accreditation visit, ACU received its best report in the institution's history, including re-accreditation for the maximum ten years as well as approval to offer three new majors. The university was founded to prepare students for careers in vocational ministry and missions, offering degrees in Biblical Studies and Christian Ministries. In 1975 the university received approval to offer degrees in Education, and subsequently added degrees in Business Administration, Behavioral Health and Music. Most recently, in 2012, under the leadership of new President Len Munsil, the university received approval from the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) to offer degrees in Biology, Communication and Political Science. Additional undergraduate degree programs are being planned, along with an expansion into graduate degrees and growth for its accelerated Degree Completion Program for working adults.
