    "text": "The Freedom Cup is a minor international rugby union trophy contested between South Africa and New Zealand, during The Rugby Championship and previously during The Rugby Championship's predecessor, the Tri Nations. It was first contested in 2004 (the 10 year anniversary of South African democracy), in a one-off test. The game, played at Ellis Park, Johannesburg was won 40\u201326 by South Africa. However, in the 2006 Tri Nations Series, it was contested in all three New Zealand\u2013South Africa matches. New Zealand won 2 of the matches (one home and one away) giving them the Freedom Cup for the first time, but during the post-match presentation after the third game, won by South Africa, Supersport presenter Joost van der Westhuizen incorrectly presented the trophy to Springbok captain John Smit who accepted it in front of millions of television viewers. The mistake was later corrected, off-air. ==Matches== {| class=\"wikitable center\" |- !align=center|Details !align=center|P !align=center| !align=center| !align=center|D !align=center|New Zealand points !align=center|South Africa points |- | align=left| New Zealand | 15 | 11 | 3 | 1 | 459 | 230 |- | align=left| South Africa | 16 | 10 | 6 | 0 | 444 | 366 |- | Overall | 31 | 21 | 9 | 1 | 903 | 596 |- |} Source:Pick and Go rugby archive \u2013 select All Blacks and Boks, Freedom Cup. ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
