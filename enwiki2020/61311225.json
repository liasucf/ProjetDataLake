The Eight Great Yak\u1e63a Generals (\u516b\u5927\u591c\u53c9\u5927\u5c06), or simply the Eight Yak\u1e63a Generals are guardian deities in Buddhism. They are retainers of Vai\u015brava\u1e47a, guardian of the north and king of the yak\u1e63as. In East Asia, they are also variously known as the Eight Great Yak\u1e63as (\u516b\u5927\u85e5\u53c9), the Eight Great Heavenly Kings (\u516b\u5927\u5929\u738b), and the Eight Brothers of Vai\u015brava\u1e47a (\u6bd8\u6c99\u9580\u516b\u5144\u5f1f). ==Relationship to Vai\u015brava\u1e47a== The term yak\u1e63ar\u0101k\u1e63asa has been used as a general term to denote the many classes of spirits in Indian mythology, combining the words yak\u1e63a and r\u0101k\u1e63asa. According to Buddhist mythology, Vai\u015brava\u1e47a is the chief of these beings, and long ago dwelt together with them in the realm of darkness. When Vai\u015brava\u1e47a converted to Buddhism, the many demonic spirits under his jurisdiction likewise assumed the role of devotees to the Buddha. Originally malevolent beings, their conversion led to their deification as benevolent guardian deities. Among the many yak\u1e63as under Vai\u015brava\u1e47a's rule, the Eight Great Yak\u1e63a Generals are ranked at the top of the hierarchy. Always at Vai\u015brava\u1e47a's command, these deities command 36,000 yak\u1e63as that serve their king and are said to protect those who venerate them. A similar list may be found among the Twenty-Eight Great Yak\u1e63a Generals. ==Yak\u1e63a Generals== Their names are given in the Commentary on the Mah\u0101vairocana Abhisa\u1e43bodhi Tantra (\u5927\u6bd8\u76e7\u906e\u90a3\u6210\u4f5b\u7d93\u758f) as follows: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
