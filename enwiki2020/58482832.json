Writing for Rolling Stone, Althea Legaspi said Parton and Sia's \"voices meld together, giving it a hymnal quality, buoyed by gospel-styled choir backing vocals.\" In a review for NPR Lars Gotrich noted the song's slower tempo compared to the original 1971 recording, calling the single \"a gospel-infused statement of purpose.\" ===Commercial performance=== The single sold 10,000 copies during its first week of release. It debuted and peaked at No. 37 on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. ===Music video=== The music video for the song was released on November 2, 2018. Neither Parton nor Sia appear in the video which follows a mourner visiting a grave, a homeless man begging for change, a child cowering in fear as her mother is abused, and an elderly woman sick in bed. It focuses on the evolution of the characters introduced at the beginning, and leaves viewers with an uplifting message of hope. ===Personnel=== Adapted from the album liner notes. *Chris Allgood \u2013 mastering assistant *David Angell \u2013 violin *Sean Badum \u2013 string recording assistant *Avery Bright \u2013 viola *Billy Bush \u2013 mixing *David Davidson \u2013 violin *Luke Edgemon \u2013 background vocals *Damon Fox \u2013 piano, B3 organ, electric guitar *Luis Flores \u2013 assistant engineer *David Goldstein \u2013 drums *Austin Hoke \u2013 cello, string arrangements *Emily Lazar \u2013 mastering *Briana Lee \u2013 background vocals *John McBride \u2013 string recording *Billy Mohler \u2013 bass *Emily Nelson \u2013 cello *Dolly Parton \u2013 lead vocals *Linda Perry \u2013 producer, engineer *Eli Pearl \u2013 electric guitar, acoustic guitar *Sia \u2013 lead vocals *Maiya Skykes \u2013 background vocals *Katelyn Westergard \u2013 violin *Kristin Weber \u2013 violin *Kristin Wilkinson \u2013 viola ===Charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |} ==References== Category:Dolly Parton songs Category:Songs written by Dolly Parton Category:1971 songs ",
