Connected by cable car to Tatransk\u00e1 Lomnica, its summit is 2634 metres above sea level, making it the second highest peak in the High Tatras after Gerlachovsk\u00fd \u0161t\u00edt (2654 m). Local shoemaker and amateur miner Jakab F\u00e1bry stated he made an ascent around 1760\u20131790, but the first recorded ascent was made by the English traveler Robert Townson and guide on 16 August 1793. He measured the elevation of the peak to be 2633 m, a meter below the actual elevation. The first winter ascent was made in 1891. In the past, Lomnick\u00fd \u0161t\u00edt was called as Vater (Father), Grossvater (Grandfather), K\u00f6nigsberg (King's Mountain), Kr\u00f3lowa Tatr and Kr\u00f3lowa Tatrza\u0144ska (Princess of the Tatra), Petra altissima kesmarkiensis and allerh\u00f6chster Kaiserm\u00e4rkerfels (Highest cliff of Ke\u017emarok), h\u00f6chste Kaiserm\u00e4rker Spitze (Highest peak of Ke\u017emarok), k\u00e9sm\u00e1rki hegyek (Hills of Ke\u017emarok), Kesmarker Spitze or Lumnitzer Spitze (Peak of Ke\u017emarok or Peak of Lomnica). Since 1940, tourists have reached the peak by cable car. They are allowed to stay on the peak for 50 minutes. The cable car system is normally closed in the month of May for annual maintenance. It is also possible to climb the peak from Lomnick\u00fd Saddle, but this is only permitted with a mountain guide. There is a solar observatory and weather station permanently manned year round at the terminus of the cable car. ==Gallery== Lomnick\u00fd_\u0161t\u00edt,_Vysok\u00e9_Tarty.jpg|Slavkovsk\u00fd \u0161t\u00edt (left) and Lomnick\u00fd \u0161t\u00edt (center right) as seen from Tatransk\u00e1 Lomnica, Slovakia Lomnicky and Kezmarsky stit from Skalnate pleso II.jpg|From left: Lomnick\u00fd \u0161t\u00edt, Vidlov\u00e9 ve\u017ee, Ke\u017emarsk\u00fd \u0161t\u00edt, and Mal\u00fd Ke\u017emarsk\u00fd \u0161t\u00edt, as viewed from Skalnat\u00e9 pleso Observat\u00f3rium Lomnick\u00fd \u0161t\u00edt 1.jpg|Solar observatory Lomnick\u00fd \u0161t\u00edt (Slovakia) built in 1962 Observat\u00f3rium na Lomnickom \u0161t\u00edte.jpg|The observatory as seen from Tatransk\u00e1 Lomnica ==References== == Sources == * http://www.vysoketatry.com/ciele/lstit/en.html ==External links== *UNESCO \u2014 Natural Reserves of Tatras Mountains * Tatry.org: Tatry Open Directory * High Tatra Mountains visualized in 3D * 3D scan of Lomnick\u00fd peak, one of the highest mountain peaks in the High Tatras mountains.
