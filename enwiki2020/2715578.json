Tulc\u00e1n sits within the northernmost outpost of the Inca Empire, which according to Spanish chroniclers, was the Rumichaca Bridge, located from Tulc\u00e0n and the present-day border with Colombia.Almeida Reyes, Dr. Eduardo (2015), \"El Camino del Inca en las Sierra Norte del Ecuador y su Valoracion Turistica\", Revista de Invetigacion Cientifica, No, 7, pp. 75-87 The Spanish, seeking gold, became interested in the Quillasinga (the name given to the land), meaning \"Gold Noses\". Quillasinga was named without distinction of the ethnic occupants including the Pastos. Upon assuming the sovereignty for the Spanish crown, the territory was divided into provinces: Quillasinga road to Quito, Quillasinga road to Popayan, Quillasinga road to Almaguer, and Quillasinga road of the mountains. Tulcan's foundation is said to have been on June 11, 1535. With the arrival of colonists and further Spanish conquistadors, its growth increased and immediately passed to serve the Township of Otavalo, until 1600 when it passed to the township of Ibarra. During the colonial age it remained under the authority of the Real Audiencia de Quito, in which it increased its economic importance, until it became the most significant locality in the region. ===Independence=== Independence movements and proclamations sparked through the region. The independence movement in Carchi was led by Alejandro Ruano, Antonio Baca, Cecilio Arciniegas, Esteban Baca, Leandro Campi\u00f1o, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pava, Antonio Rueda, and Ram\u00f3n Montenegro. On April 14, 1814 with charges of conspiracy of fighting for independence, these men were shot in Bolivar. The population continued its rebellion and in 1820, it ratified the Declaration of Independence of 9 de Octubre. Upon Ecuador becoming a republic, Tulc\u00e1n retained its importance because it became a border town. ==Proximity to Colombia== Tulc\u00e1n is just from the Colombian border; the international bridge at Rumichaca which bridges the Carchi River is shared by the two countries. Tulc\u00e1n is bounded on the north by the municipality of Ipiales (Colombia), on the south by the San Pedro de Huaca Canton, to the east by the Amazonian provinces of Sucumbios and to the west by the coastal province of Esmeraldas. This city is known for its civic culture and modern business, similar to that of Colombia because of its proximity to and significant trade with that country. ==Climate== Tulc\u00e1n features a Mediterranean climate (Csb) under K\u00f6ppen climate classification. ==Transportation== Tulc\u00e1n is very well connected in terms of land and air transport: the Panamerican Highway and Luis A. Mantilla airport are located nearby. ==See also== *Ecuador-Colombia relations ==References== ==External links== *The Best of Ecuador - Tulc\u00e1n *Ministry of Tourism, Ecuador - Carchi province (English) Category:Populated places in Carchi Province Category:Colombia\u2013Ecuador border crossings Category:Provincial capitals in Ecuador Category:1535 establishments in the Spanish Empire ",
