    "text": "350px The Seine at Port-Marly, Piles of Sand (French La Seine \u00e0 Port-Marly, tas de sable) is an 1875 painting by Alfred Sisley. It was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in 1900 whilst in the collection of Dr. Georges Viau, a Paris dentist and art collector. By 4 March 1907 it was owned by Durand-Ruel, who tried and failed to auction it on 4 March that year. It was bought by the galerie Bernheim-Jeune in April 1920 and later by Martin A. Ryerson. In 1933 Ryerson left it to its present owner, the Art Institute of Chicago, where it is now in section 201 (Impressionists) on the 1st floor of the Art Institute of Chicago. As in his Drying Nets and The Seine at Argenteuil of three years earlier, it shows the River Seine as a workplace near Port-Marly. This contrasts with most of the rest of his work which - like the other Impressionists - showed the Seine as a place of leisure.

The ochre colours of the sand contrast with the turquoise blue of the water. Sisley shows the town's paper factory, though (unlike in his 1875 The Sand Quay, Port-MarlyAnthony Lacoudre, Ici est n\u00e9 l'impressionnisme: guide de randonn\u00e9es en Yvelines, pr\u00e9face Claude Bonin-Pissarro, \u00c9d. du Valhermeil, 2003, , p. 327-329) he has removed its chimney, showing the smoke emerging from the opening in the gable. He was interested in the sand-extraction industry and painted this and several other works on the quayside at Port- Marly itself. == References== category:1875 paintings category:Paintings by Alfred Sisley Category:Paintings of the Art Institute of Chicago Category:Maritime paintings ",
