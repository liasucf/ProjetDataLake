The season began on 18 September 2016 and concluded on 21 May 2017; this was followed by the two-legged relegation play-off on 28 and 31 May 2017. The defending champions were FC Santa Coloma, who won their tenth championship in the previous season. ==Teams== ===Clubs and locations=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Team !

The league then split up in two groups of four teams with each of them playing teams within its group in a home-and-away cycle of matches. The top four teams competed for the championship and qualification spots for European competitions while the bottom four clubs played to avoid one direct relegation spot and one relegation play-off spot. Records earned in the regular season (first round) are carried over in full to the respective second round. ==Promotion and relegation from 2015\u201316== Penya Encarnada d'Andorra were relegated after the previous season due to finishing in eighth place. They were replaced by Segona Divisi\u00f3 champions Jenlai. Encamp, who finished last season in 7th place, were originally set to compete in a two- legged relegation play-off against Carroi, the runner-up of the 2015\u201316 Segona Divisi\u00f3 for one spot in the 2016\u201317 Primera Divisi\u00f3. However, on 20 May 2016, after the first leg, it was announced that Encamp were awarded the tie against Carroi, therefore Encamp remained in the top flight for the 2016\u201317 season. ==Regular season== ===League table=== ===Results=== ==Championship and relegation round== Records earned in the regular season were taken over to the Championship round and relegation round. ===Championship round=== ===Relegation round=== ==Primera Divisi\u00f3 play-offs== The seventh-placed team (third-placed in the relegation round) of the 2016\u201317 Primera Divisi\u00f3, Ordino, and the runners-up of the 2016\u201317 Segona Divisi\u00f3, Penya Encarnada, played in a two-legged relegation play-off for one spot in 2017\u201318 Primera Divisi\u00f3. \\---- Penya Encarnada won 5\u20133 on aggregate and were promoted to the 2017\u201318 Primera Divisi\u00f3; Ordino were relegated to the 2017\u201318 Segona Divisi\u00f3. ==Season statistics== ===Regular season top goalscorers=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !
