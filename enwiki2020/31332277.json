This species was described as Cynolebias bellottii by the Austrian ichthyologistFranz Steindachner in 1881 from types collected at La Plata, Argentina. The specific name honours the Italian biologist and paleontologist Cristoforo Bellotti (1823-1919), who supplied Steindachner with specimens from his collection at Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano. It is the type species of the genus Austrolebias. ==References== bellottii Category:Freshwater fish of Argentina Category:Fish of Uruguay Category:Fish described in 1881 Category:Taxa named by Franz Steindachner ",
