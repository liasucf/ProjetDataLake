    "text": "The Hasbro/Tiger Electronics VCamNow was a digital tapeless camcorder targeted to children. It was designed as a complement to the VideoNow series of personal video players, and came with editing software (the VideoNow Media Wizard) allowing users to create VideoNow videos on Microsoft Windows systems. It could also be used to take still photographs. It was available in two designs, the grey and orange original design and the grey/green/yellow VCamNow 2.0. Both designs were based on a standard compact camcorder design, with a flip-out LCD screen and a series of controls inside the screen space. Standard video resolution was 320x240 (considered roughly equivalent to VHS), while still pictures could be taken at resolutions from 320x240 up to 2048x1536. There were conflicting reports on how well it worked with Apple Macintosh editing software; while the manufacturer did not officially support the Mac, some writers stated that it used standard video formats that could be edited in standard non-linear editing packages such as iMovie. ==See also== *PXL-2000 *Mattel Vidster *ChatNow *VideoNow Category:Camcorders Category:Electronic toys Category:Hasbro products Category:2000s toys ",
