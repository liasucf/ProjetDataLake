    "text": "Seventy-Two Virgins: A Comedy of Errors is a 2004 novel by politician, journalist and current Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson. At the time, Johnson was MP for Henley, shadow arts minister, and editor of The Spectator. Since then, he has been Mayor of London (2008\u201316) and Foreign Secretary (2016\u201318), and is currently UK Prime Minister (2019). This book makes Johnson the third novelist to be Prime Minister, the first two being Benjamin Disraeli (17 novels) and Winston Churchill (Savrola). ==Plot== The President of the United States plans to visit the Palace of Westminster. A Lebanese-born terrorist aims to assassinate him; Roger Barlow, a hapless, bicycle-riding, tousled-haired MP aims to foil the attack in order to distract from a scandal involving his financial entanglement in a lingerie shop named Eulalie. ==Reception== Seventy-Two Virgins received mixed to positive reviews on original release. David Smith, writing for The Observer, said \"despite the pacy narration, there is a sense of going nowhere fast,\" but praised the humour, saying \"Yet while Johnson is a heroic failure as a novelist, he scores in his comic handling of those most sensitive issues: the ideological motives of Muslim suicide bombers (whence the title) and the mixed blessings of the American empire. The playing of these as pantomime risks causing offence, but, as in person, Johnson succeeds in being charming and sincere.\" The Spectator (which Johnson was editing at the time) gave it a positive review, Douglas Hurd comparing it to P. G. Wodehouse and praising the \"rollicking pace and continuous outpouring of comic invention\"; however, he also said that it read like it had been written in three days. (Hurd also accurately described Johnson as \"the next prime minister but three.\") In the Literary Review, Philip Oakes said that the \"Thrills [were] muffled by relentless jokiness and inordinate length of book.\" Attention was refocused on Seventy-Two Virgins in 2019, with Johnson poised to win the Conservative Party leadership election and become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. In The Guardian, Mark Lawson noted that \"it's striking that Barlow\u2019s view \u2013 that public value should make private conduct irrelevant \u2013 is one the writer has continued to embrace through domestic troubles.\" He noted the anti-French and anti-American tone, and pointed out the use of offensive language: \"references to 'Islamic headcases' and 'Islamic nutcases'. Arabs are casually noted to have 'hook noses' and 'slanty eyes'; a mixed-race Briton is called 'coffee-coloured'; and there are mentions of 'pikeys' and people who are 'half-caste'.\" Sexist content was also noted. More sinister was that \"the suggestion \u2013 from both an external observer, and the protagonist\u2019s inner voice \u2013 that Barlow [the author surrogate] may be a fraud. His assistant worries that, under the jaunty vaudeville act, there are no real core ideals, values or beliefs.\" The novel was also criticised for depicting Jews as \"controlling the media\" and being able to \"fiddle\" elections. During the 2019 general election campaign, Catherine Bennett similarly argued that the novel \"amounts to a compelling case for character reappraisal\" and that its perceived tendency to evaluate women's worth \"according to their fuckability on the \u2013 sometimes eccentric \u2013 Johnson scale\" indicates a lack of \"interest in addressing, for instance, sex discrimination, harassment, [or] the gender pay gap\". ==See also== *Terrorism in the United Kingdom *Islam in England ==References== Category:2004 British novels Category:Antisemitism in the United Kingdom Category:Books by Boris Johnson Category:Novels set in London Category:Novels about terrorism ",
