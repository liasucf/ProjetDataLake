    "text": "Clube Desportivo de Tondela is a Portuguese professional football club that plays in Primeira Liga, the top flight of Portuguese football. They are based in the town of Tondela, located in Viseu District, and play in the Est\u00e1dio Jo\u00e3o Cardoso. Founded in 1933, the club predominantly played within Portugal's regional leagues. ==History== ===Foundation and early years (1933\u20131986)=== On 6 June 1933, Clube Desportivo de Tondela was founded through a merger of two clubs in the village of Tondela: the Tondela Football Club, founded in 1925, and the Oper\u00e1rio Atl\u00e9tico Clube, founded in 1932. ===Third Division (1986\u20131988)=== On the 1985\u201386 season, Tondela won the Divis\u00e3o Honra title for the third time and achieved the promotion to the Terceira Divis\u00e3o Portuguesa for the first time. They came in 10th in their first season on a competition ruled by the Portuguese Football Federation. They were relegated in the next season as they finished in 15th. ===Lower divisions (1999\u20132005)=== After the relegation from Terceira Divis\u00e3o in 1999, Tondela went on to compete in the Viseu Regional Division. In the 2003\u201304 season, Tondela won the Ta\u00e7a AF Viseu, also known as Ta\u00e7a S\u00f3cios de M\u00e9rito, the club's first piece of silverware since 1986. In the next season, Tondela became champion of the AF Viseu Liga de Honra. They ended the season eight points ahead of runners-up Tarouquense, and ensured the return to Terceira Divis\u00e3o. Days later, Tondela retained the Ta\u00e7a AF Viseu title thus sealing the season with the double. ===Returning to Third Division (2005\u20132009)=== During the 2005\u201308 seasons, Tondela consolidated its position as an upper mid table club, ending those three seasons always in the seventh place. In the 2008\u201309 season, Tondela signed central defender Diego, midfielder Gomes and Argentine striker Piojo. On 6 June 2009, Tondela became Third Division champion, after a 4\u20132 win against Fi\u00e3es, thus being promoted to Segunda Divis\u00e3o. ===Second Division Era (2009\u20132012)=== After the promotion from the Third Division, and a fourth place in the 2009\u201310 season, Tondela aimed the promotion to Segunda Liga. During the 2010 Summer transfer window, Tondela signed Portuguese under-17 European champion, playmaker M\u00e1rcio Sousa, veteran goalkeeper Rui Marcos and midfielder Fernando Ferreira. The club finished third in the 2010\u201311 season with 55 points. Despite failing the objectives, Tondela supporters wanted the continuity of manager Filipe Moreira, but he eventually left to Oriental. On the following season, former Benfica and Portugal player, V\u00edtor Paneira was appointed as the new Tondela manager. Paneira further increased the efforts to build a solid Tondela team, with such signings as midfielders Magano and Tiago Barros, and Brazilian striker Rafael Batatinha. Tondela topped the table after a 4\u20132 win against Espinho on 7 April 2012 and never relinquished their lead. They were crowned champions of Segunda Divis\u00e3o \u2013 S\u00e9rie Centro in Est\u00e1dio do Bessa after a 1\u20130 win against Boavista. Their renovated defence, consisted by central defenders Daniel Materazzi, Pica, and the versatile Carlos Andr\u00e9, fullbacks H\u00e9lder Lopes and Pedrosa, defensive midfielder F\u00e1bio Pacheco and former Portuguese under 20 international goalkeeper Nuno Avelino, conceived just 22 goals all season and kept 13 clean sheets. Consequently, they took part in the promotion play-off against Varzim and Fatima, Serie Norte and Serie Sul champions respectively. On 3 June 2012, after a 1\u20131 draw against Fatima in Est\u00e1dio Jo\u00e3o Cardoso, Tondela achieved their third promotion in eight years, and their first ever promotion to Segunda Liga. They were runners-up in the play-off, finishing five points behind Varzim. ===Joining the Liga de Honra (2012\u20132015)=== The 2012\u201313 season, the club's first ever at the professional level, ended with a mid-table finish. It was also Tondela's first appearance in the Ta\u00e7a da Liga. On 8 November 2013, Paneira was sacked, being replaced three days later by his former teammate, \u00c1lvaro Magalh\u00e3es. After a 9th place in the championship, \u00c1lvaro Magalh\u00e3es left Tondela by \"mutual consent\" and Carlos Pinto (who had won the 2013\u201314 Campeonato Nacional with Freamunde) was appointed as the club's new manager. He took with him five players: goalkeeper Rui Nereu, defender V\u00edtor Alves, midfielder Edu Machado and forwards Lu\u00eds Machado and Joel Silva. On 6 October 2014, Pinto left Tondela due to poor results. One day later, Quim Machado was announced as Pinto's successor. The club spent most of the 2014\u201315 season near the top of the table, and by early April they were at first place. On 24 May 2015, on the final day of the season, a 1\u20131 draw away at Freamunde was enough to clinch the Championship title, and a first ever promotion to the top flight of Portuguese football. The goal was scored by Andr\u00e9 Carvalhas through a direct free kick in the very last minute of the game.Tondela e U. Madeira sobem \u00e0 Liga (Tondela e U. Madeira promoted to Liga); Record, 24 May 2015 (Portuguese) ===Into the Primeira Liga (2015\u2013)=== On 30 May 2015, Tondela announced the return of V\u00edtor Paneira as the club's manager on a one-year contract.V\u00edtor Paneira \u00e9 o treinador do Tondela (V\u00edtor Paneira is the new manager of Tondela); maisfutebol, 30 May 2015 (Portuguese) As part of the pre-season friendlies, Tondela played its first two matches abroad: the first one was a 1\u20131 draw against Hamm Benfica, in Luxembourg;Empate a um golo diante do Hamm Benfica (One goal draw against Hamm Benfica) ; Record, 12 July 2015 (Portuguese) the second was a 3\u20132 win against Millwall, at their ground, The Den.Tondelenses vencem Millwall (Tondelenses beat Millwall); Record, 1 August 2015 (Portuguese) Since Tondela's home was undergoing reconstruction, the club debuted in the top flight of Portuguese football playing at the Est\u00e1dio Municipal de Aveiro on 14 August 2015. The match ended in a controversial 1\u20132 defeat against Sporting CP. The club's first win in the competition came on the third-round, a 1\u20130 home win against Nacional da Madeira. On 6 October 2015 manager V\u00edtor Paneira left the club by mutual consent, with Rui Bento being appointed his successor on the same day. Bento was sacked two months later, following a succession of poor results, leaving the club on the last place with only 5 points. Petit was appointed the new manager on the next day. At the end of the first half of the season, Tondela had only 8 points from 17 games. By 14 March 2016 they were 11 points adrift from safety. Between the 27th and the 33rd matchdays, the club made 14 points. In the last round, Tondela won against the relegated Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra by 2\u20130 and Rio Ave won 2\u20131 against Uni\u00e3o da Madeira, meaning that the Auriverdes finished the season in 16th place with 30 points, ahead of Uni\u00e3o da Madeira. Petit successfully led Tondela to safety from relegation with the feat being dubbed a miracle. Highlights included a 2\u20132 away draw against Sporting, an historic first time win at Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o by 1\u20130, and a 4\u20131 win at Pa\u00e7os de Ferreira. On the first match of the 2016\u201317 season, Tondela lost 0\u20132 against Benfica in the first ever match that one of the Big Three played in Tondela's ground. On 9 January 2016, Petit left the club and was replaced by Pepa. ==Crest and colours== Clube Desportivo de Tondela adopt the colors green and yellow of the city.

The new Top Stand was built from scratch, upgrading the capacity from 700 standing places to 1.500 seating places, while the new North Stand increased the seating capacity from 100 spectators to 2,000. It also has bars, bathrooms and a commercial space below. The newly expanded stadium was inaugurated on 13 December 2015, in a 0\u20131 defeat against SC Braga. The stadium has also hosted some matches of Portugal's U-20, U-18, U-16 and Women squads. ==Supporters== Tondela has an organized group of supporters (claque, in Portugal) named Febre Amarela (Yellow Fever) founded in 2009. ==Players== ===Current squad=== ===Out on loan=== ===Player of the Year=== {| |- |valign=\"top\"| {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
