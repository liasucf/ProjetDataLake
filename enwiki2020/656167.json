    "text": "Forgiven, Not Forgotten is the debut studio album by Irish pop rock group The Corrs. It was released by Atlantic Records on 26 September 1995 across the world. The album was primarily produced by David Foster, with additional production by Jim Corr. In January 1997, a special tour edition of the album was released in Australia and New Zealand and featured a bonus disc containing live and rare tracks which were recorded from their Forgiven, Not Forgotten World Tour. The title track and the band were featured in an episode of Beverly Hills, 90210 called \"Turn Back the Clock\". The band performed the song at a New Year's Eve party at the Peach Pit After Dark. The album spawned five official single releases. ==Background== Before signing to Atlantic Records the band began recording in a makeshift-home-studio Jim rented out in the hometown of Dundalk. The band recorded on an eight-track and began making demo tapes, \"I remember it being very cold... We had fruit boxes on the wall for soundproofing\" Caroline remembered. After performing in Whelan's bar in Dublin, the band caught the eye of Jean Kennedy Smith who invited the band to perform at the 1994 FIFA World Cup in Boston. Once in America they met Jason Flom, Atlantic Records's head of A&R;: \"When they walked into my New York office, I was immediately taken by their beauty, their obvious grace and style. They played me a cassette with \"Love to Love You\" and \"Closer\" on it, then they told me they played all the instruments themselves and wrote the songs. Man, I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.\" However Flom knew the band needed someone to produce their album so suggested they meet David Foster, a Canadian musician, producer, composer and arranger. While in New York, two days before the band were scheduled to head home, they crashed a recording session at The Hit Factory, a recording studio in New York City. Foster invited the band upstairs to perform around a piano, where they sang \"Forgiven, Not Forgotten\" live. Sharon would go on to say \"I think he was taken back by how polished we sounded even then\". ==Tour== On 26 April 1996, The Corrs embarked on their Forgiven, Not Forgotten World Tour that started in Ennis, Ireland, before then travelling to Europe, Australia, Asia, America and Canada, ultimately lasting the better part of two years. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ===The Band=== * Andrea Corr \u2013 lead vocals, tin whistle * Caroline Corr \u2013 drums, bodhr\u00e1n, acoustic piano, vocals * Jim Corr \u2013 guitar, keyboards, acoustic piano, keyboard programming, vocals * Sharon Corr \u2013 violin, vocals ===Featuring=== * David Foster \u2013 additional keyboards, string arrangements * Simon Franglen \u2013 Synclavier programming * Michael Thompson \u2013 guitar * Tal Herzberg \u2013 bass guitar on \"Secret Life\" * Neil Stubenhaus \u2013 bass guitar on \"Toss the Feathers\" * Simon Phillips \u2013 drums on \"Toss the Feathers\" ===Production=== * Producers and Arrangements \u2013 Jim Corr and David Foster * Engineers \u2013 Andrew Boland, Felipe Elgueta and Dave Reitzas. * Mixing \u2013 Dave Reitzas and Bob Clearmountain * Mix Assistant \u2013 Ryan Freeland * Mastered by Bob Ludwig at Gateway Mastering (Portland, ME). * Assistant Mastering Engineer \u2013 Brian K.
