He studied first at Patna Medical College in Bihar, before going on to take his doctorate at the University of Minnesota. He worked in Iran before moving to the United States, joining Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan in 1963 as an assistant professor of medicine and director of haematology. He held the latter post until 1984, and later served as director of research for the Department of Internal Medicine. His main area of research has been the role of trace elements in the human body. It was largely through his work that we came to appreciate the importance of trace metals \u2013 particularly zinc \u2013 in human metabolism. He is regarded as the foremost researcher on zinc metabolism, and has received several honours, including a mastership from the American College of Physicians\u2013American Society of Internal Medicine. In 2007 he received the American College of Physicians Award for Outstanding Work in Science as Related to Medicine. In 1957, Prasad traveled to Iran and found the 'Iran Dwarfs.' Other doctors diagnosed them with hypopituitarism. Prasad decided to further investigate the matter, finding that they had zinc deficiency, a disease caused by low zinc. Discovering this, Prasad saved many lives. In late March of 2020 he was diagnosed with Covid-19. He has since recovered as well as his wife. Prasad lives with his wife Aryabala Ray Prasad. He has 4 children, 9 grandchildren, and 10 great-grand children. ==References== ==External links== *Wayne State University Press Release *January 24, 2007 WSU Prognosis Headlines Category:1928 births Category:Living people Category:Indian biochemists Category:University of Minnesota alumni Category:Wayne State University faculty Category:People from Buxar district Category:Medical doctors from Bihar Category:20th-century Indian medical doctors ",
