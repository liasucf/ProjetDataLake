It was the main settlement of the Palmares, an established group of fugitives and escaped slaves. ==History== The settlement may have been founded as early as 1602, by which time Portuguese settlers were reporting that their captives were running away and building mocambos, or small communities in the surrounding area. At this time, most enslaved Africans in the area were from Portuguese Angola, and a report from 1671 suggests that the founders of Macaco were Angolan. Quilombos were settlements mainly of survivors and free-born enslaved African people. No contemporary document called Palmares a quilombo; instead the term mocambo was used.Jane Landers. \"Leadership and Authority in Maroon Settlements in Spanish America and Brazil.\" in Africa and the Americas: Interconnections During the Slave Trade. Jos\u00e9 C. Curto and Ren\u00e9e Soulodre-LaFrance, eds. 2005. p. 178fn31 (p. 183\u2013184) . This suggests that Macaco in the 1600s was occupied by not only escaped enslaved Africans, but also to mulattos, caboclos, Indians and poor whites, especially Portuguese soldiers trying to escape forced military service. Dutch descriptions by Caspar Barlaeus (published 1647) and Johan Nieuhof (published 1682) spoke of two larger consolidated entities in the area, \"Great Palmares\" and \"Little Palmares\". In each of these units there was a large central town that was fortified and held 5,000-6,000 people. A description of the visit of Johan Blaer to one of the larger mocambos in 1645 (which had been abandoned) revealed that there were 220 buildings in the community, a church, four smithies, and a council house. This is probably similar to the layout of Macaco at that time. After 1654 the Portuguese began organizing expeditions against the mocambos of Palmares, including Macaco. During this time, Macaco was likely a town of up to 10,000 people. Macaco became the capital of the kingdom of \"Angola Janga\" which according to the Portuguese meant \"Little Angola,\" although this is not a direct translation. From 1680 to 1694, Zumbi ruled from Macaco as the king of Angola Janga. During this time, there was near constant war against the Portuguese. This concluded with a final assault against Macaco in January 1694, led by Domingos Jorge Velho.\"Palmares\", Britannica Online. Though Zumbi eluded capture, he was later captured and executed on 20 November 1695. After the war, Velho and his followers were given land grants in the former territory of Angola Janga, which they occupied as a means of keeping the kingdom from being reconstituted.Jo\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Reis & Fl\u00e1vio dos Santos Gomes, \"Quilombo: Brazilian Maroons during slavery\" , 31 January 2002, Cultural Survival Quarterly, Issue 25.4. The land surrounding Macaco has since mainly been used to cultivate sugar cane and for cattle- farming.http://wikimapia.org/4101240/pt/Uni%C3%A3o-dos-Palmares | Wikimapia: Uni\u00e3o dos Palmares The town of Uni\u00e3o dos Palmares is located 7km to the east of the site of Macaco. In 1944 it was renamed from its previous name (Uni\u00e3o) to reflect its historical significance.http://www.a-brasil.com/uniaodospalmares/index.htm | Uni\u00e3o dos Palmares - Gu\u00eda Tur\u00edstica In 1986 the site of the city was listed in the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN), and in 2003 it was officially opened by the President of Brazil.http://www.quilombodospalmares.org.br/index.php?sec=historia_serra_barriga | Serra de Barriga History The site is now protected by Parque Nacional Serra da Barriga and Parque Memorial Quilombo dos Palmares.http://www.quilombodospalmares.org.br/index.php?sec=projeto_parque_quilombo_palmares | Parque Memorial Quilombo dos Palmares ==See also== *List of topics related to Black and African people *Atlantic slave trade *Creole *Zumbi *Brazilians *History of Portugal ==Notes== Category:Colonial Brazil Category:Slave rebellions in Brazil Category:17th century in Brazil Category:Dutch Brazil Category:Slavery in Brazil ",
