Montero and Sim\u00f3 himself based on the graphic novel Bu\u00f1uel en el laberinto de las tortugas by Ferm\u00edn Sol\u00eds, about film director Luis Bu\u00f1uel making the 1933 film Land Without Bread. In August 2019, it was shortlisted as one of the three films in contention to be the Spanish entry for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film at the 92nd Academy Awards, but lost to Pain and Glory. ==Plot== The controversy surrounding his first feature length film, L'Age d'Or, leaves director Luis Bu\u00f1uel unable to find new work. An anthropologist named Maurice Legendre hands Bu\u00f1uel an ethnographic study of the Las Hurdes region of Spain and asks if he would consider making a documentary of the region. Bu\u00f1uel's friend, sculptor Ramon Acin, buys a lottery ticket and promises to use the winnings to fund the film. Indeed, Ramon wins and keeps his promise. So Bu\u00f1uel assembles a film crew in the town of La Alberca. From La Alberca, Bu\u00f1uel drives the crew to a monastery that doubles as a hostel. From the monastery, the crew explores the nearby villages. The villages consist of ramshackle box-shaped houses packed tightly. The winding streets between the houses make each village resemble a labyrinth, and Ramon notes that the jagged roofs resemble the scales on a turtle. The crew find themselves appalled by the poverty-stricken conditions of the homes. The plentifulness of their food supplies astonishes villagers. When they film a school, they find out that locals make most of their money getting government payments for taking in orphaned children, and the schoolchildren crowd around Bu\u00f1uel desperate for affection. Bu\u00f1uel later finds a little girl dying on the street, and feels helpless not having the medicine that would cure her. Although the film is a documentary, Bu\u00f1uel stages many scenes for dramatic effect, in opposition to his crew. In La Alberca, Bu\u00f1uel makes Ramon hire a farmer to reenact the local tradition of ripping the head off of a rooster. Later on, Bu\u00f1uel wants to film the image of a mountain goat slipping and falling down a cliffside, but shoots a goat dead rather than wait for an accident to happen. Bu\u00f1uel also arranges for a donkey to get stung to death by bees, to use as a symbol for the suffering of the local people. All through the shoot, Bu\u00f1uel is tormented by nightmares of his troubled childhood. One nightmare about his mother and the Virgin Mary compels him to dress in a nun's habit. When the sick girl finally dies, Bu\u00f1uel has a nightmare where he sees a friend from the region as Death. The nightmare inspires him to have the villagers reenact a funeral for an infant for the film. By 1933, Bu\u00f1uel is back in Paris editing his film, Las Hurdes: Tierra Sin Pan. Notes at the end of this movie explain that days after the Nationalist coup in Spain, Ramon Acin and then his wife were executed for their Anarchist activity. Bu\u00f1uel is able to release his movie in Spain, but without Ramon's name. Movie notes explain that he was able to restore Ramon's name to the credits many years later. ==Release== The world premiere was held at the 2018 Animation Is Film Festival in Los Angeles on October 20, 2018. It was released in cinemas in Spain on April 26, 2019. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2018 animated films Category:2010s biographical films Category:Spanish animated films Category:Spanish biographical films Category:Spanish films Category:Films about film directors and producers Category:Films about filmmaking Category:Films set in Paris Category:Films set in Spain Category:Films set in the 1930s Category:Films based on Spanish comics Category:Animated films based on comics ",
