    "text": "Espoo (; , ) is the second largest city and municipality in Finland. It is part of the Finnish Capital Region, along with the cities of Helsinki, Vantaa, and Kauniainen. Most of its population lives in the inner urban core of the Helsinki metropolitan area. Espoo shares its eastern border with Helsinki and Vantaa, while enclosing Kauniainen. Other bordering municipalities of Espoo are Nurmij\u00e4rvi and Vihti in the north, and Kirkkonummi in the west. The city is located on the shore of the Gulf of Finland, in the region of Uusimaa, and has a population of . Espoo encompasses , of which is land. The national park of Nuuksio is situated in northwestern Espoo. Espoo does not have a traditional city center, having instead several local regional centers. Espoo is thus divided into seven major areas (, ): Vanha-Espoo (with administrative center), Suur-Espoonlahti, Pohjois-Espoo, Suur-Kauklahti, Suur-Lepp\u00e4vaara, Suur-Matinkyl\u00e4, and Suur-Tapiola. Aalto University is based in Otaniemi, Espoo, along with a thriving science community that includes numerous startups and organizations such as VTT \u2013 the Technical Research Center of Finland. Several major companies are based in Espoo, including Nokia, HMD Global, Tieto, KONE, Neste, Fortum, Orion Corporation, Outokumpu, and Foreca, as well as video game developers Rovio and Remedy Entertainment. The city of Espoo is officially bilingual. The majority of the population, 75.1%, speaks Finnish as their mother tongue and 6.9% speaks Swedish. 18% of Espoo's population has a first language other than Finnish or Swedish. ==Etymology== The name Espoo probably comes from the Swedish name for the River Espoo, Esp\u00e5 (or Esp\u00e5\u00e5), which in turn comes from the old Swedish word \u00e4spe, meaning a border of aspen, and the Swedish word for \"river\", \u00e5, thus \"a river bordered by aspen\". The name was first mentioned in 1431. The banks of the River Espoo are even today heavily populated with aspen. ==History== VR Class Vk3 steam locomotive at Kauklahti railway station in the 1920s Anti-aircraft searchlight in Haukilahti in 1940 The first inhabitants in the area arrived about 9,000 years ago. Physical evidence (pollen grains) indicates agriculture from ca. 1000 AD, but there are no historical records. Up to the 13th century, the area was a borderland between the hunting grounds of Finnish Proper and Tavastian Finns, with a sparse population. Immigrants from Sweden established permanent agricultural settlements to the area from the late 13th century onwards after the so-called Second Crusade to Finland. Espoo was a subdivision of the Kirkkonummi congregation until 1486\u20131487. The oldest known document referring to Kirkkonummi is from 1330; Espoo as a subchapter has been dated to the 1380s, although the first document directly referring to Espoo is from as late as 1431. The construction of the Espoo Cathedral, the oldest preserved building in Espoo, marks the independence of Espoo. Administratively, Espoo was a part of Uusimaa. When the province was split to Eastern and Western provinces governed from the Porvoo and Raasepori castles, respectively, the eastern border of the Raasepori province was in Espoo. The 13th-century road connecting the most important cities in Finland at that time, the King's Road, passes through Espoo on its way from Stockholm via Turku and Porvoo to Viipuri. In 1557, King Gustav Vasa decided to stabilize and develop the region by founding a royal mansion in Espoo. The government bought the villages of Esp\u00e5by and Mankby (Finnish: Mankki) and transferred the population elsewhere, and built the royal mansion in Esp\u00e5by. (Mankby was eventually abandoned and was never repopulated.) The royal mansion housed the king's local plenipotentiary (vogt), and collected royal tax in kind paid by labor on the mansion's farm. The administrative center Espoon keskus has grown around the church and the Espoo railway station, but the municipality has retained a network-like structure to the modern day. In 1920, Espoo was only a rural municipality of about 9,000 inhabitants, of whom 70% were Swedish speaking. Agriculture was the primary source of income, with 75% of the population making their living from farming. Kauniainen was separated from Espoo in 1920, and it gained city rights the same year as Espoo, in 1972. Espoo started to grow rapidly in the 1940s and '50s. It quickly developed from a rural municipality into a fully-fledged industrial city, gaining city rights in 1972. Due to its proximity to Helsinki, Espoo soon became popular amongst people working in the capital. In the fifty years from 1950 to 2000, the population of Espoo grew from 22,000 to 210,000. Since 1945, the majority of people in Espoo have been Finnish-speaking. In 2006, the Swedish-speaking inhabitants represented barely 9% of the total population. The population growth is still continuing, but at a slower rate. ==Geography== The districts and major areas of Espoo ===Location=== Espoo is located in southern Finland, along the shore of the Gulf of Finland, and in the region of Uusimaa and the Helsinki sub-region.

Other neighbouring municipalities are Vantaa to the east and northeast, Nurmij\u00e4rvi to the north, Vihti to the northwest, and Kirkkonummi to the west and southwest. Espoo is a part of the Finnish Capital Region, which is the inner core of the Greater Helsinki metropolitan area. ===Subdivision=== Espoo is divided into seven major areas (, ): Vanha-Espoo (with administrative center), Suur-Espoonlahti, Pohjois- Espoo, Suur-Kauklahti, Suur-Lepp\u00e4vaara, Suur-Matinkyl\u00e4, and Suur-Tapiola. These major areas are then divided into a total of 56 districts. ===Features=== Although Espoo is relatively highly populated, it has large amounts of natural wilderness, particularly in the city's western and northern portions.

In April 2018, despite the dumping of its women's teams, Espoo United declared bankruptcy and its men's teams folded. In April 2019, the women's ice hockey team Espoo Blues merged with Kiekko Espoo Oy, a significant junior hockey club with the largest girls hockey program in the country, to become Kiekko-Espoo.
