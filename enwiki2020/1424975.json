    "text": "The University of Minnesota Rochester (UMR) is a public university in Rochester, Minnesota. It is part of the University of Minnesota system and focuses primarily on general health sciences. It was formally established by an act of the state legislature in December 2006. UMR currently offers two bachelor's degrees in health science and the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities campus offers several graduate programs at the education center in downtown Rochester. ==History== Rochester legislators and community advocates started the campaign to increase higher education in the local area as early as the 1950s. Courses were offered in engineering, education, and math starting in 1966 as a satellite site of the University of Minnesota in coordination with other institutions. In the early 1990s, an educational coalition was formed with Rochester Community and Technical College and Winona State University Rochester to form the University Center Rochester \u2013 three institutions, two systems, and one campus. In 1998, Rochester was identified by the legislature as a future branch of the University of Minnesota system. This designation allowed the Rochester site to develop its own leadership structure and to begin to develop its own academic program independent of other campuses. In 2000, the University heightened efforts to grow both the graduate satellite programs of the Rochester branch by adding a new provost to lead the campus and staff to accommodate this growth. The current University of Minnesota Rochester began to take form in January 2005 when then-Governor Tim Pawlenty announced in his State of the State address that southeastern Minnesota was underserved by public higher education, and announced a plan to initiate research into solving the problem. The governor formed the Rochester Higher Education Development Committee (RHEDC) and appointed local business owner Marilyn Stewart to lead the group. The committee consisted of representatives from other public and private education institutions, area business leaders, and leaders in health care. The group's charge was to formulate a plan to advance higher education in the Rochester area. The RHEDC eventually identified the need for a branch campus of the University of Minnesota system that could integrate with the health sciences programs and needs of the Mayo Clinic. The group promoted the University of Minnesota system as the only higher education provider in a position to carry out this ideal, in spite of the existing branch campus of Winona State University - Rochester and Rochester Community and Technical College. The RHEDC report was drafted and delivered to the legislature and the governor. The recommendations of the report were adopted by the governor, the legislature and the University of Minnesota Board of Regents. Controversially, this establishment represented a change in collegiate policy by establishing an additional University of Minnesota branch campus in spite of the prior policy that stated it was the role of the Minnesota State system to provide programming for Greater Minnesota. In 2006, the University of Minnesota Rochester was approved as a branch campus by the Board of Regents, and shortly after, selection of existing space in the former downtown mall allowed for the future siting of the campus. Staff were appointed to start the general health sciences undergraduate program. In the fall of 2007, UMR staff moved into the renovated facilities at the newly renamed University Square in downtown Rochester and welcomed its new Chancellor, Dr. Stephen Lehmkuhle. He was inaugurated in April 2008 with a community celebration and formal address.Stachura, Sea (April 4, 2008) \"U of M Rochester inaugurates new chancellor\" Minnesota Public Radio In September 2010, UMR chose the \"Raptor\" as the mascot, and took on the maroon and gold colors of the university system.Post Bulletin, (September 9, 2010)\" \" In fall of 2011, UMR added the Bachelor of Science in Health Professions (BSHP) degree program, which is delivered jointly with the Mayo School of Health Sciences. Students in the BSHP program graduate with a both degree from UMR and a certificate from the Mayo School of Health Sciences in one of five health-related fields: Respiratory Care, Echocardiography, Sonography, and Radiography. On May 18, 2013, UMR graduated its first class of undergraduate students in the Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences and Bachelor of Science in Health Professions programs at the Mayo Civic Center in downtown Rochester. ==Student enrollment and graduation== Total UMR enrollment trended upward from 2009 through 2013, as UMR added courses; however, enrollment plateaued under 500 students, then dropped sharply. In 2009 UMR admitted only first-year students. Beginning in the fall of 2012, courses were available for first-year, sophomore, junior, and senior undergraduate students. The number of first-year students hit a peak in the fall of 2013 and dropped off by 56.1% in the spring of 2015. 2016 and 2017 incoming freshman classes have shown increasing enrollment again. According to the UM official enrollment information the 2018 class had 179 new incoming students, plus another 40 new transfer students.University of Minnesota Rochester UMR has 519 degree-seeking students enrolled during the fall 2018 semester (137 freshmen, 147 sophomores, 124 juniors, and 111 seniors). 340 students had graduated from UMR as of 2016. On May 18, 2013, UMR graduated its first class of 49 undergraduate students in the B.S. in Health Sciences and B.S. in Health Professions programs at the Mayo Civic Center in downtown Rochester.Post Bulletin, (May 17, 2013)\"\" 73 students graduated the following year, an additional 109 graduating during the 2014-2015 academic year, and another 109 walked across the stage on May 15, 2016. ==Cost of attendance and student debt== UMR's costs of attendance has risen significantly since it first admitted students in 2009. In the 2010 aid year (covering fall 2009, spring 2010, and summer 2010) the cost of attendance (COA) was $21,762. In 2017 that cost was $26,136, a 20.1% increase. UMR's COA for the 2017-2018 academic year was $26,136. For reference the Twin Cities campus COA $27,348); followed by Duluth ($24,540), Morris ($23,922), and Crookston ($23,866).{https://onestop.crk.umn.edu/finances/cost-attendance The average loan debt for UMR students who graduate with debt was $38,876 in aid year 2017. 25% of graduating students did so with no debt in 2017. ==On-campus housing== UMR's on-campus housing option is 318 Commons. The facility has a number of high-end features, such as granite countertops, particularly when compared with student housing on other campuses. Because 318 Commons is designated as on-campus, UMR sets the rental rate, and the student pays the University along with tuition, fees, and other expenses. For the 2015-2016 academic year, rates at 318 Commons ranged from $3550 for a double (shared) bedroom to $4800 for a single room with private bathroom on the 9th floor. UMR is the only University of Minnesota campus that does not offer a meal plan. Each of the University of Minnesota campuses have apartment-style housing, and many have diverse or unique options, making comparisons of every option difficult. However, each campus has double (shared) bedroom apartments. The 2015-2016 rents for those apartments are compared in the chart below. The Crookston and Twin Cities campuses have multiple double occupancy apartments available at different rates. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Campus !! Fall semester !! Spring semester !!
