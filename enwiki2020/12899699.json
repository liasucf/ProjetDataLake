On April 15, 2003, the album was remastered and reissued in an expanded edition with new liner notes and four bonus tracks, two of which are taken from Leslie West's first solo album, 1969's Felix Pappalardi-produced Mountain, the project which eventually led to the formation of the band. == Track listing == === Side 1 === #\"Never in My Life\" (Leslie West, Felix Pappalardi, Gail Collins, Corky Laing) \u2013 3:53 #\"Taunta (Sammy's Tune)\" (Felix Pappalardi) \u2013 1:00 #\"Nantucket Sleighride (to Owen Coffin)\" (Felix Pappalardi, Gail Collins) \u2013 5:55 #\"Roll Over Beethoven\" (Chuck Berry) \u2013 2:58 #\"For Yasgur's Farm\" (George Gardos, Corky Laing, Felix Pappalardi, Gail Collins, Gary Ship, David Rae) \u2013 3:23 #\"The Animal Trainer and the Toad\" (Leslie West, Sue Palmer) \u2013 3:29 === Side 2 === #\"Mississippi Queen\" (Leslie West, Corky Laing, Felix Pappalardi, David Rea) \u2013 2:32 #\"King's Chorale\" (Felix Pappalardi) \u2013 1:04 #\"Boys in the Band\" (Felix Pappalardi, Gail Collins) \u2013 3:43 #\"Don't Look Around\" (Leslie West, Sue Palmer, Felix Pappalardi, Gail Collins) \u2013 3:47 #\"Theme for an Imaginary Western\" (Jack Bruce, Pete Brown) \u2013 5:07 #\"Crossroader\" (Felix Pappalardi, Gail Collins) \u2013 4:53 === 2003 Reissue Bonus Tracks === #\"Long Red\" (Leslie West, Felix Pappalardi, John Ventura, Norman Landsberg) \u2013 3:17 #\"Dreams of Milk and Honey\" (Leslie West, Felix Pappalardi, John Ventura, Norman Landsberg) \u2013 3:36 #\"Silver Paper\" (Leslie West, Felix Pappalardi, Gail Collins, George Gardos, Steve Knight, Corky Laing) \u2013 3:19 #\"Travelin' in the Dark (to E.M.P.)\" (Felix Pappalardi, Gail Collins) \u2013 4:25 Mountain - The Best of Mountain (1973, remastered & expanded edition 2003) album releases & credits at Discogs.com ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Chart (1974) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|62 |- |United States (Billboard 200) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|72 |} == Personnel == * Leslie West \u2013 guitar, vocals * Felix Pappalardi \u2013 bass, vocals * Steve Knight \u2013 organ * Corky Laing \u2013 drums, percussion ==References== == External links == * Mountain - The Best of Mountain (1973) album review by Eduardo Rivadavia, credits & releases at AllMusic.com * Mountain - The Best of Mountain (1973) album releases & credits at Discogs.com * Mountain - The Best of Mountain (1973) album to be listened as stream at Play.Spotify.com Category:Mountain (band) albums Category:1973 greatest hits albums Category:albums produced by Felix Pappalardi Category:Columbia Records compilation albums ",
