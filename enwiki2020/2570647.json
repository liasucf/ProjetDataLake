    "text": "The Duff reaction or hexamine aromatic formylation is a formylation reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of benzaldehydes with hexamine as the formyl carbon source. It is named after James Cooper Duff, who was a chemist at the College of Technology, Birmingham, around 1920\u20131950. The electrophilic species in this electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction is the iminium ion CH2+NR2. The initial reaction product is an iminium which is hydrolyzed to the aldehyde. See mechanism below. The reaction requires strongly electron donating substituents on the aromatic ring such as in a phenol. Formylation occurs ortho to the electron donating substituent preferentially, unless the ortho positions are blocked, in which case the formylation occurs para.Mundy, Bradford P.; Ellerd, Michael G.; Favaloro, Frank G. (2005). Name Reactions and Reagents in Organic Synthesis, 2nd Edition, John Wiley & Sons, pp. 222 \u2013 223. Examples are the synthesis of 3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde: Duff reaction 3,5-di-tert- butylsalicylaldehyde and the synthesis of syringaldehyde: Duff reaction syringaldehyde == Reaction mechanism == The reaction mechanism displayed below demonstrates step by step how hexamine donates a methine group to an aromatic substrate via a series of equilibria reactions, with iminium ion intermediates. Initially, addition to the aromatic ring results in an intermediate at the oxidation state of a benzylamine. An intramolecular redox reaction then ensues, raising the benzylic carbon to the oxidation state of an aldehyde. The oxygen atom is provided by water on acid hydrolysis in the final step.
