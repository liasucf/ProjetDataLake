Some are made of paperboard composite honeycomb. There are many different design configurations that exist within the paper pallet market that may use glue, staples and paper cores in their assembly, although designs have been engineered from just two flat corrugated boards. Lifdek Corporation designed a two-piece paper pallet system from corrugated fibreboard which allows multiple pallet sizes to be produced by a global network of box manufacturers. Pallet blanks are shipped flat-packed and assembled on site when needed. EXA Consult designed a paper pallet system from cardboard which allows custom pallet sizes at the best prices. ==See also== * Unit load ==References== * Fiedler, R.
