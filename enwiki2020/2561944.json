Most recently, John has been involved with Kurt Vile, Sonic Youth, Alvvays, Sweet Apple, Dinosaur Jr., Thurston Moore and Jemina Pearl. ==Career== ===Early work=== Agnello's life in the studio began in 1979 at the age of 19 while working as an intern at the legendary Record Plant Studios in Manhattan. He worked his way up the ladder and became the studio\u2019s go-to-assistant. He assisted on a number of albums including those by Aerosmith, Twisted Sister, Scandal, John Cougar Mellencamp, and John Waite. John also worked briefly on \u201cBorn In the USA\u201d with Bruce Springsteen. However, working on Cyndi Lauper\u2019s She\u2019s So Unusual! had the biggest recording and production impact on him at the time. He worked with some of the great engineers and producers of that time, including, Jack Douglas, Jimmy Iovine, Rick Chertoff, William Wittman, Mike Chapman, Dave Thoener, Jay Messina, Roy Cicala, and Shelly Yakus. He got his first true break engineering on the second album by The Hooters. He was involved with artists such as Patty Smyth, Sophie B. Hawkins and The Outfield. The Outfield's first record, Play Deep, had a #2 hit with \"Your Love\". Around that time, he also got to do one off session with Bob Dylan and Mick Jagger, two of his favorite artists. The Bob Dylan song was \u201cSeries Of Dreams\u201d which he co-mixed with Bill Wittman. That version was used by NARAS when presenting Bob Dylan with his lifetime achievement award. And the Mick Jagger song, \"Hard Woman\", was for a special made-for-MTV only video. ===1990s=== During the early nineties, Agnello began an association with Dinosaur Jr. and the Screaming Trees. This collaboration has extended through almost a dozen records. In fact, John recently mixed the heralded Dinosaur Jr. reunion record, Beyond, with the original lineup.
