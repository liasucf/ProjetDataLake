During Spanish colonization of the Americas, Barlovento was developed as estate owners founded cacao haciendas. The work on the estates was done by African slaves brought from what is now the Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola. These people were from the Kingdom of Kongo and Kingdom of Loango. There were also Yoruba slaves. The culture of African and Spanish inhabitants has merged into the \"drum dancing\", Barlovento's typical Afro-Venezuelan celebration. This occurs particularly at the time of the feast of San Juan. Other events include the Entierro de la Sardina (Burial of the Sardine) and Day of the Dead. A syncretism has occurred where Catholic saints represent traditional African deities. ==Toponymy== Dawn in Puerto Encantado, Higuerote \"Barlovento\" is a Spanish word meaning \"windward\".Guss D. The Festive State: Race, Ethnicity, and Nationalism as Cultural Performance University of California Press, 2001 p. 28 This is due to the wind coming from Barlovento to the south of the region, where it brings heavy rain, then returning to the coast to cross the Caribbean and the Atlantic Ocean, bringing rain to the Canary Islands. ==Location== Barlovento lies near the coast of Venezuela which forms the northern aspect of South America. It is located between the parallels 10 \u00b0 and 11 \u00b0, north latitude and the meridians 65 \u00b0 and 67 \u00b0, longitude west.Barlovento Google Maps accessed 26 August 2017.

To the east is the Caribbean Sea and Anzo\u00e1tegui State. To the south is Serran\u00eda del Interior, Anzo\u00e1tegui state and Gu\u00e1rico state.

Its terrain is ranges from the mountains of Caucagua to the beaches of Higuerote and R\u00edo Chico. The exploration of the Plain of Barlovento, which forms the base of the Barlovento depression, was documented by Jesus A. Silva I.Jesus Silva I Cronista Silva Irazabal website. It lies between the Valles del Tuy to the east and Anzo\u00e1tegui state to the west. To the south is the Gu\u00e1rico state. To the north and northeast is Mirandize state. This northern area is rich in limestone. It is formed by deposits from the rivers from the Serran\u00eda del Interior mountains in the central region of the Cordillera de la Costa. Among the slopes of the Serran\u00eda del Interior are grottoes, caves and caverns. An example is La Tapa de Cambrai near Birongo.Cueva la Tapa de Cambural natural monument Wikimap It was discovered by a poacher in 1934 and explored on 9 March 1952 by the Venezuelan Society of Natural Sciences. Venezuelan Society of Natural Sciences SVNC website. Many rivers cross the Plain of Barlovento. The deposition of sediment has allowed the formation of oilfields between Valles del Tuy and Cariaco. ==History== Between 1576 and 1810 about 100,000 African people were brought to Venezuela in the slave trade.

Celebrations with music and dancing were made. Despite the objections of Bishop Mariano Marti to these \"ridiculous and earthly diversions\" when he visited the region in 1784, the festival continued to gain in popularity. The date of the feast, June 25, aligned with the harvesting of the cocoa bean crop, the onset of the wet season and the summer solstice.Nichols E. and Morse K.
