Originally inhabitants of Auldgirth located to the scheme, situated next to the A76, but in recent years this has expanded to the outlying areas due to rejuvenation programmes. The name Auldgirth is from Middle English ald(e) girth, meaning 'old enclosure'. At one time it had a manned railway station, situated one mile south of the village, just before the hamlet of Dalswinton. Carse Loch and the Friar's Carse country house hotel are located nearby. ==See also== *Dalgarnock Village, Church and Parish *Barburgh Mill, Closeburn ==References== Category:Villages in Dumfries and Galloway ",
