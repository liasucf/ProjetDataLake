    "text": "Constantin G\u00e2lc\u0103 (born 8 March 1972) is a Romanian retired footballer, and is a manager currently in charge of Danish Superliga club Vejle Boldklub. He was equally at ease as a defensive or central midfielder and had an accurate long- range shot. He first made a name for himself at Steaua Bucure\u0219ti, then proceeded to spend one full decade in Spain, playing in 318 matches in both major levels combined and representing five clubs. Additionally, G\u00e2lc\u0103 appeared for Romania in two World Cups and as many European Championships, winning 68 caps. ==Playing career== ===Club=== Born in Bucharest, G\u00e2lc\u0103's senior career began at age 16 in the third division, with FC Progresul Bucure\u0219ti. Only one year after he switched to the Liga I with lowly FC Arge\u0219 Pite\u0219ti, for whom he played four times towards the end of the season, soon breaking into the Romanian national under-21 team. After one more season with solid displays (31 games, two goals), G\u00e2lc\u0103 signed with country giants CSA Steaua Bucure\u0219ti, immediately beginning to produce: in his debut campaign, he scored five times in 26 matches. G\u00e2lc\u0103 stayed at Steaua two more years, netting 13 goals combined. After winning the domestic cup and having appeared in nearly 200 official matches, he left for Spain where he would remain the next 11 years. First stop was RCD Mallorca in the Balearic Islands, for which he scored 13 times to help to a promotion to La Liga (that total was tied for squad best). He then experienced a steady period with Barcelona-based RCD Espanyol, scoring five goals in his third season, which also ended with conquest of the Copa del Rey. G\u00e2lc\u0103 signed with Villarreal CF in summer 2001, but was deemed surplus to requirements midway through his second year, which he finished in the second division on loan to Real Zaragoza, being instrumental as the latter club returned to the top flight after one year of absence by starting in all his appearances. G\u00e2lc\u0103 still had three more solid seasons in the country with second-tier club UD Almer\u00eda, playing 40 matches in his last season, one year before the Andalusians first reached the top division. He eventually returned to the national team with this team in 2005 \u2013 after a three-year absence \u2013 and retired in June 2006 at the age of 34. ===International=== Galca made his full debut for Romania on 22 September 1993, against Israel in a friendly. Called up for the 1994 FIFA World Cup he played three times during the tournament, against the United States in the group stage, in the famous 3\u20132 round-of-16 success against Argentina and in the penalty shootout defeat to Sweden in the last-eight. From 1996 to 2000, G\u00e2lc\u0103 featured in over forty more international games for Romania, often pairing with Dorinel Munteanu in central midfield. During the qualifying phase for the 1998 World Cup the national side were undefeated in their ten group fixtures, drawing only once and netting 37 goals, with him scoring two. In those finals and UEFA Euro 2000 the country was beaten, respectively, in the last-16 and last-eight, as he started in every match. ====International goals==== (Romania score listed first, score column indicates score after each G\u00e2lc\u0103 goal) {| class=\"wikitable\" !

He was sacked on 19 January 2010, after a string of poor results. On 20 August 2013, G\u00e2lc\u0103 was named head coach of Romania under-17s. He ended his contract in June 2014 and, also in that month, was appointed at league champions FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti on a two-year deal, replacing outgoing Lauren\u021biu Reghecampf and leading the team to the double in his first and only season. On 14 December 2015, G\u00e2lc\u0103 replaced former club teammate Sergio at the helm of Espanyol. His first game in charge took place the following day, a 2\u20131 home win against Levante UD for the Copa del Rey (3\u20132 on aggregate). The following 27 May, having led the Periquitos to 13th, his contract was not renewed. G\u00e2lc\u0103 was hired by Al-Taawoun FC of the Saudi Professional League on 19 October 2016. For the following season, he moved to Al-Fayha FC in the same league. Having won once in nine games and with the club in the relegation zone, he was dismissed on 7 November 2017. On 6 March 2019, G\u00e2lc\u0103 returned to European football with Vejle Boldklub, last-placed in the Danish Superliga. ==Honours== ===Player=== Steaua Bucure\u0219ti *Liga I: 1992\u201393, 1993\u201394, 1994\u201395, 1995\u201396 *Cupa Rom\u00e2niei: 1991\u201392, 1995\u201396 *Supercupa Rom\u00e2niei: 1994, 1995 Espanyol *Copa del Rey: 1999\u20132000 ===Manager=== Steaua Bucure\u0219ti *Liga I: 2014\u201315 *Cupa Rom\u00e2niei: 2014\u201315 *Cupa Ligii: 2014\u201315 *Supercupa Rom\u00e2niei: Runner-up 2014 Vejle Boldklub *Danish 1st Division: 2019\u201320 ==Managerial statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=2|Team !rowspan=2|From !rowspan=2|To !colspan=8|Record |- !G !!
