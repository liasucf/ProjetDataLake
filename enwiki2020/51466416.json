    "text": "Everybody on My Dick Like They Supposed to Be is a mixtape by American singer- songwriter and musician Paul Banks, best known as the frontman of the band Interpol. Self-released by Banks on January 25, 2013 through DatPiff, it was originally intended to be a pre-release bonus for Banks' second solo studio album, Banks (2012). In contrast to Interpol's rock music sound and Banks's solo work, the mixtape features hip hop tracks and lo-fi hip hop instrumentals, all produced by Banks. It also features guest appearances from rappers El-P, Talib Kweli, High Prizm, and Mike G. ==Critical reception== Pitchfork critic Jayson Greene panned the mixtape, writing that none of the tracks from the record \"is remotely salvageable\". Greene also compared the instrumentals to those \"on YouTube made by well-meaning college sophomores\", concluding that there is \"no effort, vision, or craft in this music\". ==Track listing== # \"Rise Like the Sea\" \u2013 1:38 # \"Best Kill Me\" \u2013 0:32 # \"Driver\" \u2013 0:50 # \"Beauty\" \u2013 1:30 # \"What's in the Box\" (featuring Talib Kweli) \u2013 2:14 # \"Iron Mike\" \u2013 3:18 # \"Just Don't Buy It\" (demo excerpt) \u2013 0:33 # \"Young Again\" (demo excerpt) \u2013 0:54 # \"It Was a Goal\" \u2013 2:01 # \"Only a Man (I Work for Dick Jones)\" \u2013 3:08 # \"Young Again\" (demo excerpt pt.
