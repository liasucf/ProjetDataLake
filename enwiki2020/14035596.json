    "text": "Boogie Woogie is a 2009 British black comedy film directed by Duncan Ward and produced by Eric Eisner and Leonid Rozhetskin. It is based on the novel of the same name by Danny Moynihan, who adapted his own book on the New York art world of the 1990s and titled it based on the Piet Mondrian painting Victory Boogie-Woogie. The film stars Gillian Anderson, Alan Cumming, Heather Graham, Danny Huston, Christopher Lee, Joanna Lumley, Charlotte Rampling, Amanda Seyfried, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd and Jaime Winstone. It premiered on 26 June 2009 at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. ==Plot== Boogie Woogie is a comedy of manners, its cast of characters devouring each other in a small world awash with big money. Set against the backdrop of contemporary London and the international art scene, it casts an eye over the appetites and morality of some of its major players. Dealers, collectors, artists, and wannabes vie with each other in a world in which success and downfall rest on a thin edge. Elaine is an art school graduate, and up-and-coming star. Working in the video medium, her works largely consist of recordings of her own sexual exploits, supplemented by conversations she has observed clandestinely or as a third party. Joany is Elaine's muse, and lover (hence a subject in her films) within a volatile, brittle relationship. Elaine is not faithful to her, but is preoccupied with her work, and is ambitious to succeed. The film opens with these two arguing at home. Joany leaves with Elaine in pursuit, and we hear a crash and see a spray of shattered glass behind Joany. Elaine mutters \"No. Oh no.\", but begins videoing what she sees. This will be revealed later. Art Spindle is the biggest art dealer in London. Outwardly charming, as a dealer must be, he is in fact greedy and manipulative. Bob and Jean Maclestone are a couple whose marriage is no longer happy. Bob is very wealthy, and collects art voraciously as an investment, with little enthusiasm for its cultural significance. Jean is an art enthusiast, who enjoys Bob's ability to acquire it. Through binoculars from his office, Spindle observes the couple entering the art gallery of his rival, Grossman, much to his disgust. Bob and Jean arrive next at Spindle's gallery. A spin painting that Bob would like to purchase is unavailable, but Spindle suggests another piece. While Bob is out of the room, Jean flirts with Spindle. Beth Freemantle works for Spindle as gallery director. She has ambitions to open her own gallery, and has secretly sought Bob's assistance. Bob has entered her office, where he offers her his recommendations regarding breast augmentation choices she is perusing on her computer. He mentions that he has found a location for her gallery. He also sees a slide of the Rhinegolds' Boogie Woogie painting and decides he must have it. Re-joining his wife and Spindle, he sees the suggested painting (two women measuring each other's large breasts), and wants that too. Alfred and Alfreda Rhinegold are \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Nazi Germany, who have been wealthy but, in retirement, have fallen on hard times. Alfred has amassed a collection of fine modern art, but his wife now tries to persuade him to accept the purchase offers they receive from Spindle to raise funds. Their butler, Robert, also encourages him to sell. Alfred is especially determined never to sell the Mondrian painting, which gives the film its title, because he bought it from the artist in person. Dewey Dalamanatousis is an art enthusiast and friend of Elaine's. Initially, he acts as her promoter. Together with Joany, the three of them attend an exhibition at the Spindle gallery. Paige Oppenheimer is another art enthusiast. At first meeting, we see Paige rollerblading through London, past the Rhinegolds' home in Lower Bond Street, over the River Thames, and to the Spindle gallery. Camera angles invite us to appreciate her obvious sex appeal. Jo Richards is a conceptual artist, whose reputation is beginning to fade. He enjoys the sound of his own voice, and the opportunities that being an artist give him to seduce women. He arrives at the gallery at the same time as Paige, opening the door for her and watching her walk inside. We discover that gallery director Beth is his girlfriend and he asks to borrow money from her. From across the room, Jean Maclestone catches Jo's eye, and he looks back at her with a wry smile. Jean asks Beth to introduce her to Jo. Dewey introduces himself and his companions to Jo (who has forgotten his previous meeting with Dewey and does not impress the women). Instead, Elaine warms to Beth, briefly videos her and invites her to visit Elaine's workplace. Dewey begs Beth for a meeting with Art Spindle. Spindle is in his office, completing the hiring of Paige to work for him. We discover that Spindle knows Paige's father, another collector. Reluctantly, Spindle agrees to spare five minutes to see Dewey. Dewey proposes to curate a show of his own devising at the Spindle gallery. Spindle feigns interest, but as Dewey leaves, he discards the explanatory portfolio. Dewey realises he did not leave a business card, and goes back into the office, where he sees his portfolio in the bin. Later, in a fashionable bar, Dewey laments his bad luck to Elaine (she's videoing as usual). He blames her presence for his failure to keep a boyfriend, but she is distracted by \"cute\" Charlotte Bailey, who works at another art museum. Elaine and Charlotte leave the bar together, and video their encounter at Elaine's flat. Leaving the gallery after her successful job interview, Paige reattaches her rollerblades, and Jo takes the opportunity to introduce himself. Later, we see Paige rollerblading through a park. She feels a pain in her midriff, causing her to fall. Bob and Beth visit the location of her prospective gallery, where they kiss. Later, Elaine is showing Beth her videos at the Spindle gallery. Beth is impressed. At the Maclestones' home, Bob is rearranging his collection, giving extra space to his Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i. Jean argues that it looked better before. She pronounces the artist's name in a commonplace way, but Bob insists that it have an authentic Romanian pronunciation. Spindle calls to offer Bob the Boogie Woogie for a higher price than he'd offered the Rhinegolds. He also mentions that he has hired Paige. She limps into his office, and while he dictates a letter to Alfreda, he observes the injury to her leg. He applies ointment, but his hands wander between her legs, causing her to exclaim that she would treat herself later. At that moment, Beth walks in with a message and sees them in the compromising situation. At Jo's workspace. He is dictating notes to himself while lifting a dumbell. At a knock, he abandons the writing, snorts a line of white powder and answers the door. Jean is there. Some of the pieces of work he shows her require the observer to adopt a particular stance giving his hands the opportunity to wander over her from behind and a sexual encounter ensues. Beth is visiting Bob at his office. He asks her if she has ever used an explicit sculpture by the Chapman brothers for sexual gratification, and offers to demonstrate. She suggests reverting their relationship to a strictly professional one, but they proceed to intimacy instead. Back at the Spindle gallery, Art has received Beth's resignation. He resents her betrayal and threatens to make life difficult for her, dismissing her angrily. With her back to the closed door, she smiles in delight. He instructs his accounts department to stop all commissions due to her, audit her expenses, block her password, and terminate her mobile phone. In a bar across town, Spindle is hosting a party to celebrate the success of the current show. Beth is among the group and he thanks her for her efforts while explaining to the others that she is leaving the gallery. Elaine arrives, videoing the party. Dewey finds himself ignored. Elaine and Beth visit the bathroom to do drugs together, and Beth proposes replacing Dewey as Elaine's promoter. Jo invites Paige to visit his workspace, and since his intentions are clear to Jean, she intervenes between them, suggesting that Jo accompany her on a planned trip to New York. They visit the men's room where she performs fellatio. They are almost caught by Bob, and one of Jean's shoes falls under the cubicle partition, where a smiling Bob returns it. At home later, Jean asks Bob for a divorce. Bob accepts without hesitation, and she is upset by that. They argue about how long they've been together, he remarks casually that she seems interested in \"the artist\", and he also notices that her shoes look familiar. She leaves for Spindle's home, where she hopes to find refuge and advice. At Elaine's, she is talking with Dewey. She gives him a generous gift, but follows it up with the termination of their business relationship. Dewey takes it badly. Paige is visiting Jo's workspace, where he uses his art installations to attempt a seduction. She declines it. Although a butler to the Rhinegolds, the shadowy Robert Freign is also an amateur artist. He advises Alfreda that Spindle's offer for the Mondrian is too low. Later on, Spindle visits the Rhinegold home, meeting Robert secretly. They agree an improved arrangement, whereby Spindle will increase his offer for the Boogie Woogie and pay to insure it for an even greater amount. Robert gifts Spindle one of his own paintings. Later, Robert phones Spindle and tells him that an even greater offer has been received. Emille is a friend of Jean's, who has experience of three marriages and lucrative divorces. They meet for lunch to discuss Jean's split from Bob. The Maclestones own several houses around the world, but Emille recommends taking possession of their art collection instead. She also recommends not leaving evidence of her relationship with Jo, such as a flight and hotel stay in New York. Bob has the mirror conversation with his lawyer, and when he discovers Jean wants the art he suggests selling it all to avoid giving her a moral victory. He engages Spindle to arrange the sale, demanding strict secrecy from Jean, to which Spindle agrees. Paige has been promoted to be Beth's replacement as director. Bob has bought her flowers by way of congratulation, and invites her to dinner later in the week. Dewey arrives at Elaine's flat (he is her upstairs neighbour). Elaine makes Joany get out of her bath to answer the door, then videos the conversation. Dewey threatens to commit suicide, Joany doesn't believe him. Later, Dewey accosts Elaine in the street and demands to know why she is avoiding him, but gets no satisfaction. To complete his deal for the Boogie Woogie, Spindle visits the Rhinegolds, bringing a box of Alfred's \"favourite\" cigars as a gift. The unhappy Alfred directs him to a table where many similar boxes lie. Spindle tells Alfreda that he is disappointed they had entertained the increased offer. He assumes it came from his rival, Grossman, and tells her that the other gallery owner has cashflow problems and so should not be trusted to bid. Alfreda tells him that the other offer had come from Bob Maclestone, and shows him the letter. Alfred insists that he will still not sell the painting at any price. Spindle increases the amount again, but is dismissed. In the taxi after their dinner date, Paige tells Bob that she is ill. They complete their journey, but Bob discovers her unconscious in the bathroom. He cannot resist pulling her dress aside to enjoy a glimpse of her \"spectacular\" breasts, but calls the ambulance anyway. Surgery reveals the remains of an unborn twin that had always been hidden within Paige. The doctor believes the waiting Bob to be Mr Oppenheimer, and calls him into an office to explain Paige's condition. Bob asks to see the remains of the twin, and evidently takes it home. Later, at the Spindle gallery, Bob reveals a gift box to the now-recovered Paige. Within is the twin, suspended in formaldehyde, which he proudly explains he has had Damien (Hirst) \"make a piece of\". Her perplexed reaction passes over his head. Jean flies home after her New York trip and is appalled to discover the house is empty of art. Jo and Beth are in bed at his flat. It seems that she had, indeed, undergone the breast augmentation she considered near the beginning of the film. Jo found himself unable to perform, blaming tiredness from the transatlantic flight, but Beth suspects the true reason is scarring due to the surgery. The telephone answering machine records Beth's voice complaining about her art loss and demanding his help. Beth realises his sexual betrayal and cancels her promise to arrange his art show. Jean confronts Spindle at home about his part in the art sale. Among her accusations is that he had been caught (by Beth in his office) in a sexual position with Paige. A naked man emerges from Art's bedroom demanding to know the truth (we have only seen ambiguous glimpses of his lover before this). At Elaine's flat, she and Beth are drinking and sharing a cigarette. Beth complains about Jo's behaviour, including the effect her scars had had on him. Elaine is fascinated to see Beth's breasts, and despite Beth's gentle protestations, Elaine then seduces her (which is captured by the nearby video camera). Back at the Rhinegolds', Alfred falls asleep holding the butt of a cigar, which falls onto the carpet. The resulting fire kills him and destroys the house and all its contents. Spindle tells Bob at the gallery how he had been swindled over a Mondrian, but that it had been burnt somehow. At the cemetery, Spindle joins Alfreda and Robert with the others attending Alfred's burial, offering her his condolences. She explains that the insurance payout is expected without a problem, and that she and Robert are planning to move to Tuscany. As a parting gift to Robert, Spindle gives him a slide of a painting he thinks might be of interest, but mutters hateful comments once the car door is closed. At the opening party for Beth's new gallery, the inaugural event is Elaine's show. Her videos are being projected onto the gallery's walls at great size. Various guests have widly differing opinions - some think it tasteless, others brave and powerful. Joany considers it \"tacky\" and regrets her own exposure in the films. Spindle arrives with his boyfriend, concealing any resentment he feels, he expresses delight at his own video appearance, and even seems to forgive Bob when he reveals his backing for Beth. Beth has invited her parents, but her father is outraged at having to see a \"goddamned porno movie starring my daughter\" and has sent her mother home in a taxi \"in hysterics\". Spindle takes Elaine to one side, and tells her that he's planning a new show (based on Dewey's idea that he had rejected), with her as the star. A woman representing Vanity Fair approaches Elaine to suggest writing an article about her, and their lingering eye contact suggests further meetings to come. The video dwells at this point on Joany's storming out of their flat, and especially on Dewey's angry visit and suicide threat. The final seconds of the video explain the opening scene: the crash, the spray of shattered glass behind Joany, and Elaine's commentary \"Oh no. Oh no, my god... Dewey\", for sure enough his body has crashed down onto the roof of a parked taxi. Finally, Spindle dictates a business letter to his newly-appointed assistant, Charlotte Bailey. ==Cast== ==Production== Danny Moynihan's novel for Boogie Woogie was published in 2000, based on his hedonistic New York years. Dennis Hopper originally held the option to adapt the novel into a screenplay for a film to be set in New York City; later, Moynihan's friend, Duncan Ward, a documentary film-maker, became involved, with Rachel Weisz agreeing to play the \"central, nubile gallerist\" role eventually portrayed by Graham. After Weisz dropped out, producers switched the film's location to London for cost reasons; Moynihan \"discovered then-unknown Amanda Seyfried living around the corner in Chelsea\" and got her cast as an \"art-world nymphet\"; Charlotte Rampling, a family friend of Moynihan's, got a cameo appearance. Principal photography took place in London in December 2006.Boogie Woogie, production notes from a fansite for Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd ==Reception== Richard Clayton--in a Sunday Times article about the film that focuses on \"who inspired its unsavoury characters\"--called it \"The Devil Wears Prada and Hangs Out at Private Views, but with a lot more sex and naughty bits.\" According to a National Public Radio review, \"just about all the acting in this otherwise pedestrian satire is fabulous, and for want of other diversions you might amuse yourself itemizing all the squandered talent\"; the film conflates \"black comedy with cynicism\" and \"ends, dispiritingly, pretty much where it began.\" The Daily Beast called it a \"dead- on satire of the contemporary art world that is loved by the very audience it savages.\" Rex Reed called it a \"tepid spoof that only occasionally evokes a reluctant smile\" and said it \"failed to capture the nuances or craft a more brutal, incisive expos\u00e9 of the art milieu.\" ==Miscellaneous== The Fat Boy Slim video for Star 69 features video clips from the movie. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2009 films Category:2009 black comedy films Category:2009 LGBT-related films Category:Adultery in films Category:British black comedy films Category:British films Category:British LGBT-related films Category:English-language films Category:Films about the arts Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films set in London Category:Films shot in London Category:Lesbian-related films Category:LGBT-related comedy films Category:2009 comedy films ",
