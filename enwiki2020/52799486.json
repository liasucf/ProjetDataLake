    "text": "The Penrose Inquiry was the public inquiry into hepatitis C and HIV infections from NHS Scotland treatment with blood and blood products such as factor VIII, often used by people with haemophilia. The event is often called the Tainted Blood Scandal or Contaminated Blood Scandal. It was not in the terms of reference of the inquiry to examine events in England, a statutory public inquiry has never been held in England. The Penrose Inquiry was set up by Scottish Government under the Inquiries Act 2005 and cost \u00a312,123,754.http://www.penroseinquiry.org.uk/downloads/1447242115-Penrose%20Inquiry%20-%20Publication%20of%20Costs.pdf It was announced by Nicola Sturgeon on 23 April 2008. The Rt Hon Lord Penrose was the chairman of the inquiry. ==Publication== Lord Penrose did not attend the launch of the final report which was held on 25 March 2015 in Edinburgh. He was reported to have been too ill to attend. ==Criticism== The final report of the Penrose Inquiry was widely branded a whitewash after it made only one recommendation, that steps should be taken to offer blood tests to anyone in Scotland who had a blood transfusion before 1991 and who has not already been tested for hepatitis C. The Inquiry did not apportion blame. Professor John Cash who was a former director of the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service said the executives responsible were able to avoid giving evidence. \"Did Lord Penrose get to speak to the people with the real answers? No, he didn\u2019t,\" \"He tried but through no fault of his own he couldn\u2019t get to the truth. He ran into serious problems because the Inquiries Act meant there was a whole area he could not address\". Five deaths were examined as outlined in the inquiry's terms of reference, these were, Reverend David Black, Mrs Eileen O'Hara, Alexander Black Laing, Neil Mullen and Victor Tamburrini. Out of these 5 cases, only 1 of the victims was a Haemophiliac. The 1 haemophilia case was a Hepatitis C infection that occurred in the 1960s, before Factor concentrates were in use, meaning that the case did not relate to the relevant period which is regarded at the mid-1970s\u20131980's. None of these examined cases involved HIV infection. ==Aftermath== Following the publication of the Penrose Inquiry, David Cameron became the first British Prime Minister to offer a formal apology for the scandal. Damages have never been paid before or after the inquiry to victims or their families in England or Scotland. Damages have been paid in Ireland. ==References== == See also == *Contaminated blood scandal in the United Kingdom *Contaminated haemophilia blood products Category:Public inquiries in Scotland Category:NHS Scotland Category:Hepatitis C Category:2008 establishments in Scotland Category:2015 disestablishments in Scotland Category:Medical scandals in the United Kingdom Category:HIV/AIDS in the United Kingdom Category:Health disasters in the United Kingdom Category:Contaminated haemophilia blood products ",
