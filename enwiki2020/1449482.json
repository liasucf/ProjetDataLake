As of 2012, its population was 301. ==Overview== Situated on a limestone outcrop of the Eocene age to the west of the canyon of the Rio Vero in the Sierra y Ca\u00f1ones de Guara Natural Park, the village grew up around a castle and the Collegiate church of Santa Maria, which was consecrated in 1099. The name of the village comes from the Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0635\u0631 al qa\u00e7r for \"fort\" or \"castle\" (renamed as Alcazar in Spanish). The castle became the main defense point of the nearby city of Barbastro. Since Alqu\u00e9zar is situated in the Sierra y Ca\u00f1ones de Guara Natural Park, there are various campsites in the local area to cater to outdoor enthusiasts. Popular activities include canyoning, walking, rock climbing and abseiling, as well as ornithology (since vultures nest on the steep faces of the Rio Vero canyon). The surrounding area to the south towards Barbastro, in the direction of the flatter Ebro basin, is part of the Somontano, an area known for its fine wines. There are more than 60 limestone caves with prehistoric cave paintings in the surrounding area, which has led to the region being declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1998. A good example is the cave at Arp\u00e1n on the A-2205 road heading north towards B\u00e1rcabo. ==Gallery== File:Alqu\u00e9zar - vista desde la Colegiata.jpg|View of Saint Michael's church from the Collegiate church File:VistadeAlquezar.JPG|View of the village from above ==References== ==External links== * *Alqu\u00e9zar Tourist Office's website (Spanish) *Somontano information website *Alqu\u00e9zar page on information website *Somontano prehistoric cave paintings Category:Municipalities in the Province of Huesca ",
