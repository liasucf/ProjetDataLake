Eve launched on CBBC on 5 January 2015 with its 13-episode first series occupying a Monday afternoon slot in the channel's schedule. This was later followed by special airing on Christmas Day 2015. A 12-episode second series followed in 2016. The third series was first confirmed by a post on Poppy Lee Friar's Instagram account and began airing on Wednesday 19 October 2016 and concluded on 8 January 2017. Written by children's writer Emma Reeves, Eve was co-created with David Chikwe, creative director of Blacklisted Films. Emma Reeves is best known for her writing in the shows of the Tracy Beaker series. ==Cast== ===Main=== *Poppy Lee Friar as Eve, the protagonist of the series. Eve is a newly-awakened gynoid whose appearance is based on Mary Douglas during the 1970s. In public she assumes the guise of Will's cousin from the United States. Eve is socially inept and often unaware of the many dangers she often finds herself in, but with help from her adopted family she learns to pass for a human and decide her own course. *Oliver Woollford as Will Clarke, a teenage boy who awakened Eve and Dr. Clarke's son. He develops a strong relationship with Eve and holds a fierce desire to protect her, even at the cost of his own safety though his stubbornness often brings him into conflict with his family and friends. *Eubha Akilade as Lily Watson, a genius teenage girl and socially awkward hacker who is Will's best friend. She also forms a close friendship with Eve and despite occasional jealousy, is both fascinated by and protective of the often ignorant gynoid. *Elijah Ayit\u00e9 as Abe Watson, Lily's acquisitive little brother who affectionately refers to Eve as \"Robo Girl\". Though a constant annoyance to Will and Lily and largely unaware or uninterested in ethics or empathy, he actually cares deeply for Eve and maintains a moral code. *Ben Cartwright as Dr. Nick Clarke *Rhona Croker as Dr. Katherine Calvin, the antagonist of the first season; a brilliant but highly contemptuous and ambitious scientist and manager of Calimov Systems. She usually holds Nick and his family in little regard. *Jane Asher as Mary Douglas, the transhumanist main antagonist of the series and Eve's creator. She believes humans are good only for death and destruction and thus seeks to replace them with a species of artificial intelligence that will eventually shape the future of the entire universe. ===Recurring=== * Shonagh Price as Maddy Watson *Richie Campbell as Viv Watson *Jenny Bede as Rebecca Clarke *Ellie Grainger as KT *Alex Sawyer as Michael Hoffman *Michael Wildman as Lord Hoffman *Peter Collins as Mr Gwenlan *Rory Barraclough as Chris *Paksie Vernon as Laurie *Chris Hegarty as Cain *Billy Ashworth as Zac and Adam ==Episodes== == Awards and nominations == {| class=\"wikitable\" !style=\"background:#CCCCFF\"|Ceremony !style=\"background:#CCCCFF\"|Award !style=\"background:#CCCCFF\"|Nominee !style=\"background:#CCCCFF\"|Result |- |2015 British Academy Children's Awards |Children's Performer in 2015 |Poppy Lee Friar | |- |2015 London Screenwriters\u2019 Festival: British Screenwriters Awards |Best British Children's Television |Emma Reeves, Andrew Yerlett, Joe Williams, Ann Marie Di Mambro, Vivien Adam and Kirstie Swain | |- |2016 Writers' Guild of Great Britain Awards |Best Children's TV Episode |Emma Reeves for \"Control, Alter, Delete\" | |- |2016 Broadcast Awards |Best Children's Programme |Eve | |- |2016 Televisual Bulldog Awards |Best Children's Programme |Eve | |- |2016 Royal Television Society Scotland Awards |Best Children's Programme |Eve | |- |2016 Royal Television Society Scotland Awards |Best Sound |John Cobban / 422.tv | |} ==References == ==External links== * * Category:Androids in television Category:2010s British children's television series Category:2015 British television series debuts Category:2017 British television series endings Category:BBC children's television shows Category:British drama television series Category:British science fiction television shows Category:Fictional androids Category:Transhumanism in television series ",
