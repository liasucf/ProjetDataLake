Retrieved March 5, 2012 is a gospel singer, bass guitar player, and record producer. He is regarded as one of the most popular figures in contemporary gospel music. He is known for using a variety of different styles in his music such as R&B;, hip-hop, and disco. ==Musical career== Hammond has been active both as a member of the gospel performing group Commissioned, and as a solo artist (currently for Verity Records). He is a multiple Grammy-, Dove-, Stellar-award winner and nominee as a performer, producer and writer. Hammond first gained recognition while playing bass guitar for the gospel group The Winans. By 1985, he was one of the six original members of the group Commissioned, participating in 10 of the group's 12 albums. After his time with Commissioned ended, he regained fame in the gospel community after selling millions of albums with his musical group Radical For Christ. In 2002, Hammond returned to the group Commissioned (now with members Keith Staten, Marvin Sapp, Mitchell Jones, Karl Reid, Michael Williams, and Marcus Cole) to produce the Commissioned Reunion Live album. Hammond produced \"\"Make Me Like the Moon\", a stirring gospel ballad co-written by Chant\u00e9 Moore and Kenny Lattimore for their 2006 double-CD of gospel and R&B; love songs entitled Uncovered/Covered (released October 10, 2006 by LaFace/Verity/Zomba Music Group).

Hammond divorced his wife of 18 years, Kim, in 2004, and he currently resides in Cedar Hill, Texas. Hammond revealed on the Donnie McClurkin Show that his mother confessed to him three months before she died that she had attempted to have him aborted. The procedure, done in 1960, before abortions were legal, failed. Hammond's mother returned for a second attempt but decided against the procedure; Hammond was later born in December 1960.My Mom Nearly Aborted Me One of Hammond's nephews is Utah Jazz guard Emmanuel Mudiay. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Living people Category:African-American musicians Category:American gospel singers Category:Urban contemporary gospel musicians Category:Singers from Detroit Category:1960 births Category:People from Cedar Hill, Texas Category:20th-century American bass guitarists ",
