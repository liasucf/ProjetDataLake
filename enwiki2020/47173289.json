Formerly one of Denmark's five richest and the 10th wealthiest woman in Europe, Spies today is chairwoman for Simon Spies Fonden (The Simon Spies Foundation). == Biography == Spies was born Janni Isager Brodersen on 19 September 1962 to Yvonne Brodersen (1929\u20132007) and Werner Heinrich Isager (1922\u20132011) in the Copenhagen suburb Herlev. Her mother was a seamstress and homemaker, and her father was a telephone technician. When in tenth grade, Janni at age 16 dropped out of school and started working as a messenger girl at the travelling agency . She caught the attention of the company owner, Simon Spies, and the then 20-year-old Janni married the 61-year-old Simon Spies on 11 May 1983 in Holmen Church in central Copenhagen. To their wedding 3.000 guests were invited. Simon Spies died less than a year later on 16 April 1984, and bequeathed the majority of his estate to his wife, making her one of Europe's richest women. Spies became chairwoman of the board upon her husband's death, and in 1989 acquired the travelling agency . Spies sold the entire company in 1996 to what is now Sunclass Airlines. She has later been accused of having destroyed her inheritance by bringing her brother, a former toolmaker, Leif Brodersen on the board together with a friend of his, the former trade union economist Steffen M\u00f8ller. Her board now counseled her to purchase three Airbus A300 in 1987 and in 1991 another six brand new and very expensive Airbus A320. As the Airbus A300 were very difficult to sell, the passengers became fewer due to the Gulf War the entire Spies company ended up in severe financial difficulties.

And as he took over as chairman of the board, (with Janni as vice chairwoman only) Leif Brodersen left the Spies company.http://www.tic.travel/node/10789 But the financial problems didn't end there, and in 1993 had several banks to add new capital to the bankruptcy threatened travelling agency.
