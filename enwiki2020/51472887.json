It is now part of Danske Bank's headquarters. ==History== ===Erich Erichsen's house=== Erich Erichsen The Erichsen Mansion was built for merchant and shipowner Erich Erichsen in 1799. It was designed by Caspar Frederik Harsdorff but when he died later that same year it was completed by his son-in-law Gottfried Schaper in 1801. ===J\u00f8rgensen and Hansen=== Advertisement for the furniture store Rasmus J\u00f8rgensen, known as Specie-J\u00f8rgensen, purchased the building in 1833. In 1846, he sold it to royal furniture maker Christopher Bagn\u00e6s Hansen. ===Bank headquarters=== Kj\u00f8benhavns Handelsbank acquired the building in 1888. The building was subsequently restored and adapted for its new use under supervision of the architect Frederik Levy. It was completed on 18 April 1891. ==Architecture== The building has a central projection with Ionic order columns supporting a triangular pediment. The relief depicting Mercury and Minerva shaking hands over an altar was designed by G. D. Gianelli. According to Schaper, Harsdorff had opposed this design since free-standing columns were deemed too dominant in private house design. The interior is richly decorated by the French architect Joseph-Jacques Ram\u00e9e and the French painter Pierre \u00c9tienne Lesueur with murals and frescos in Pompeian style. ==References== ==External links== * Rendering in the Danish National Art Library * Category:Houses in Copenhagen Category:Listed residential buildings in Copenhagen Category:Caspar Frederik Harsdorff buildings da:Erichsens Pal\u00e6 ",
