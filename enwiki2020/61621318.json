    "text": "The Picador is an 1832 watercolor painting by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, showing the 'tercio de pique' or third phase of a bullfight. It is held in the department of prints and drawings at the Louvre with other drawings of bullfights by the same artist, notably Picador and Chuletillo (lead pencil, 1832). The work's small dimensions allowed him to compete with the sinister The Bullfights of Bordeaux by Goya.
