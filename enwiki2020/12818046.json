Sivanath Sastri wrote (about Sen and his contemporaries), \"These young leaders are trying to keep up the Brahmo name and the work of the Brahmo Samaj of India; thereby strengthening the hope, expressed before, of their counteracting the narrowing influence of Keshub Chunder Sen\u2019s close adherents.Sastri, Sivanath, History of the Brahmo Samaj, 1911-12/1993, p. 510, Sadharan Brahmo Samaj. ==Formative years== The son of Madhusudan Sen, and nephew (sister's son) of Keshub Chunder Sen, he was born on 25 September 1868 at Kolkata. Sen received Western education, supported by his father, who had been initiated into the Brahmo Samaj by Debendranath Tagore. Sen topped his class throughout his academic career. He mastered the intricacies of Western philosophy. After his graduation with honours in English and philosophy from the General Assembly\u2019s Institution (now Scottish Church College) in 1888, he did his Master of Arts in history and philosophy from Calcutta University.Sengupta, Subodh Chandra and Bose, Anjali (editors), 1976/1998, Sansad Bangali Charitabhidhan (Biographical dictionary) Vol I, , pp. 345-346, ==Career== He started working in Baharampur College and worked in Tej Narayan Jubilee College at Bhagalpur for a short period before joining Presidency College in 1893. His lectures outside the college premises drew in large number of listeners.Niyogi, Niranjan, Smritir Gourab Smritir Sourav (The scent of glorious memories), 1969, , pp. 199-208. ==Brahmo Samaj== Inspired by Keshub Chunder Sen from a young age, he undertook all work for the Brahmo Samaj, along with Pramathalal Sen and Mohit Chandra Sen, under the guidance of Protap Chunder Mozoomdar and Krishnabihari Sen. In 1897, he and Mohit Chandra Sen opened a students\u2019 hostel named \u2018Fraternal Home\u2019 at 92 Harrison Road (renamed Mahatma Gandhi Road). In 1898, when plague struck Kolkata, the residents of \u2018Fraternal Home\u2019 participated in the relief activities. Many persons attended his classes on Bhagavad Gita held at Albert Hall. He took the lead to act parts of it and enlivened the entire environment. Many persons attended his prayer-meeings. Among them was Brajendra Nath Seal. He was elected president of \"Youngmen & Interpretation\" and \"Theistic Endeavour Society\". He represented Brahmo Samaj in the World Conference of Liberal Religions, organised by Unitarians at Geneva in 1905 and was felicitated by the Unitarians. At the conference his paper dealt with the problem of religion in modern India. While arguing the need for more theology, he warned against \u2018dry rationalism\u2019 that would stifle the spiritual impulse. He organised a school for the moral education of Brahmo children. It was looked after mostly by his wife, Shakuntala Devi. He was associated with numerous educational and welfare activities of the Brahmo Samaj. Sen was actively involved in the functioning of Victoria Institution. He presided over the Indian Theistic Conference held at Lahore in 1909. ==Other activities== Sen was a member of Calcutta University for many years, and was inspector of colleges. He was secretary of Calcutta University Institute. Upadhyay Gour Govinda Ray used to say, \"Benoyendranath is a rose in bloom.\" At the time of Titanic disaster in 1912, Sen presided over a memorial service. His prayer service evoked the tragic dimension of the disaster and touched all present. He died at a comparatively young age after being ill for some time. ==Works== The Pilgrim, Lectures and Essays, The Intellectual Ideal, Arati, Gita Adhayan. ==References== Category:Bengali people Category:Brahmos Category:Scholars from Kolkata Category:People from Bhagalpur Category:1868 births Category:1913 deaths Category:Scottish Church College alumni Category:University of Calcutta alumni ",
