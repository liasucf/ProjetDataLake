    "text": "Craig MacGillivray (born 12 January 1993) is a Scottish professional footballer who currently plays as a goalkeeper for League One club Portsmouth. ==Club career== ===Non League Career=== MacGillivray began his career as a reserve team goalkeeper for Harrogate Railway Athletic, eventually earning a move to Stalybridge Celtic in 2011. After making four appearances for Stalybridge in an injury\u2013hit season, MacGillivray joined Harrogate Town in August 2012. He rejoined Harrogate Railway Athletic on loan for a brief spell in 2012. Following his return from loan, MacGillivray emerged as Harrogate Town's first\u2013choice goalkeeper and made 90 appearances for the club over two seasons in the Conference North. He was linked with moves to a number of Football League clubs during this time. ===Walsall=== Despite agreeing a two\u2013year deal with Harrogate in November 2012, MacGillivray joined League One side Walsall on 13 June 2014 on an initial one-year deal after the two clubs agreed a compensation package. He acted as a deputy to Richard O'Donnell for much of the 2014\u201315 season but MacGillivray eventually made his debut for the Saddlers on 25 April 2015, keeping a clean sheet in a 2\u20130 victory over Oldham Athletic. On 20 May 2015, MacGillivray signed a new one-year contract with the club. He made eight appearances in total in 2015\u201316 as Walsall missed out on promotion via the play-offs and was offered a one-year deal at the end of the season. At the end of the 2016\u201317 season, Walsall and MacGillivray mutually agreed to end his contract after being unable to guarantee the stopper a regular starting place. ===Shrewsbury Town=== On 5 July 2017, MacGillivray joined fellow League One side Shrewsbury Town on a free transfer on a one-year deal. He was offered a new contract by Shrewsbury at the end of the 2017\u201318 season. ===Portsmouth=== On 4 June 2018, League One club Portsmouth announced that MacGillivray had signed on a two-year deal. MacGillivray made his Portsmouth debut at Fratton Park in their opening league match on 4 August 2018, earning a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 win over Luton Town. On 31 March 2019, MacGillivray started in goal for Portsmouth in the EFL Trophy final against Sunderland. MacGillivray made a save in the penalty shootout, saving a spot kick from Lee Cattermole. Portsmouth went on to win the shootout 5\u20134 (2\u20132 after extra-time). ==International career== On 27 August 2019, MacGillivray was called up to the senior Scotland squad for the first time by manager Steve Clarke. ==Career statistics== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|FA Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals |- |rowspan=3|Walsall |2014\u201315 |League One |2||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||2||0 |- |2015\u201316 |League One |5||0||2||0||0||0||1||0||8||0 |- |2016\u201317 |League One |5||0||0||0||0||0||4||0||9||0 |- !colspan=3|Total !12||0||2||0||0||0||5||0||19||0 |- |rowspan=1|Shrewsbury Town |2017\u201318 |League One |8||0||2||0||0||0||4||0||14||0 |- |rowspan=4|Portsmouth |2018\u201319 |rowspan=3|League One |46||0||5||0||0||0||5||0||56||0 |- |2019\u201320 |20||0||2||0||3||0||2||0||27||0 |- |2020\u201321 |6||0||0||0||2||0||1||0||9||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !72!!0!!7!!0!!5!!0!!8!!0!!92!!0 |- !colspan=3|Career total !92!!0!!11!!0!!5!!0!!17!!0!!125!!0 |} ==Honours== ===Club=== Walsall *EFL Trophy runner-up: 2014\u201315 Shrewsbury Town *EFL Trophy runner-up: 2017\u201318 Portsmouth *EFL Trophy: 2018\u201319 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Scottish footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Harrogate Railway Athletic F.C. players Category:Stalybridge Celtic F.C. players Category:Harrogate Town A.F.C. players Category:Walsall F.C. players Category:Shrewsbury Town F.C. players Category:Portsmouth F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:People from Perthshire Category:Footballers from North Yorkshire Category:Anglo-Scots ",
