    "text": "Joseph Charles Marin (1749, in Paris \u2013 18 September 1834, in Paris) was a French sculptor ==Life== He was a student of Claude Michel and made several attempts to win the Grand Prix de Sculpture before the French Revolution, only winning it in 1801 with the bas-relief Caius Gracchus leaving his wife Licinia. Michel was a strong influence on Marin's early style, which was light, elegant and gracious. He later adopted more austere subjects and style closer to the canons of neo-classicism then in force. In 1813 he became a professor at the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des beaux-arts de Lyon on the death of his former teacher Joseph Chinard, the post's previous holder. ==Bibliography== *Patrice Bellanger, Joseph-Charles Marin, Sculpteur, Paris, 1992, Galerie Patrice Bellanger \u00e9diteur, (), 88 pages.
