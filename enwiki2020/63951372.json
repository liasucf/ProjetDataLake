    "text": "In functional analysis, the strong dual of a topological vector space (TVS) X is the continuous dual space of X equipped with the strong topology or the topology of uniform convergence on bounded subsets of X, where this topology is denoted by b\\left( X^{\\prime}, X \\right) or \\beta\\left( X^{\\prime}, X \\right). The strong dual space plays such an important role in modern functional analysis, that the continuous dual space is usually assumed to have the strong dual topology unless indicated otherwise. To emphasize that the continuous dual space, X^{\\prime}, has the strong dual topology, X^{\\prime}_{b} or X^{\\prime}_{\\beta} may be written. == Strong dual topology == === Definition from a dual system === Let (X, Y, \\left\\langle \\cdot , \\cdot \\right\\rangle) be a dual system of vector spaces over the field {\\mathbb F} of real ({\\mathbb R}) or complex ({\\mathbb C}) numbers. Note that neither X nor Y has a topology so we define a subset B of X to be bounded if and only if \\sup_{x \\in B} \\left| \\left\\langle x, y \\right\\rangle \\right| < \\infty for all y \\in Y. This is equivalent to the usual notion of bounded subsets when X is given the weak topology induced by Y, which is a Hausdorff locally convex topology. The definition of the strong dual topology now proceeds as in the case of a TVS. Note that if X is a TVS whose continuous dual space separates point on X, then X is part of a canonical dual system \\left( X, X^{\\prime}, \\left\\langle \\cdot , \\cdot \\right\\rangle \\right) where \\left\\langle x, x^{\\prime} \\right\\rangle := x^{\\prime}(x). === Definition on a TVS === Suppose that X is a topological vector space (TVS) over the field {\\mathbb F} of real ({\\mathbb R}) or complex ({\\mathbb C}) numbers. Let \\mathcal{B} be any fundamental system of bounded sets of X (i.e. a set of bounded subsets of X such that every bounded subset of X is a subset of some B \\in \\mathcal{B}); the set of all bounded subsets of X trivially forms a fundamental system of bounded sets of X. A basis of closed neighborhoods of the origin in X^{\\prime} is given by the polars: :B^{\\circ} := \\left\\\\{ x^{\\prime} \\in X^{\\prime} : \\sup_{x \\in B} \\left| x^{\\prime}\\left( x \\right) \\right| \\leq 1 \\right\\\\} as B ranges over \\mathcal{B}). This is a locally convex topology that is given by the set of seminorms on X^{\\prime}: \\left| x^{\\prime} \\right|_{B} := \\sup_{x \\in B} \\left| x^{\\prime}\\left( x \\right) \\right| as B ranges over \\mathcal{B}. If X is normable then so is X^{\\prime}_{b} and X^{\\prime}_{b} will in fact be a Banach space. If X is a normed space with norm \\| \\cdot \\| then X^{\\prime} has a canonical norm (the operator norm) given by \\left\\| x^{\\prime} \\right\\| := \\sup_{\\| x \\| \\leq 1} \\left| x^{\\prime}(x) \\right|; the topology that this norm induces on X^{\\prime} is identical to the strong dual topology. == Properties == Let be a locally convex TVS. * A convex, balanced, weakly compact subset of is bounded in X^{\\prime}_b. * Every weakly bounded subset of is strongly bounded. * If is a barreled space then 's topology is identical to the strong dual topology and to the Mackey topology on . * If is a metrizable locally convex space, then the strong dual of is bornological if and only if it is infrabarreled, if and only if it is barreled. * If is Hausdorff locally convex TVS then is metrizable if and only if there exists a countable set of bounded subsets of such that every bounded subset of is contained in some element of . == See also == * * * * * * * == References == ==Bibliography== * * * * Category:Functional analysis ",
