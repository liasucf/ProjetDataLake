It focuses on college admissions in the United States. The authors define both the title of this book as well as their goals in writing it as: \"to create greater awareness of the small, distinctive cluster of colleges and universities of excellence that are available to gifted college-bound students.\" In the introduction, the authors further explain their aim by referring specifically to \"the group historically known as the 'Little Ivies' (including Amherst, Bowdoin, Middlebury, Swarthmore, Wesleyan, and Williams)\" which the authors say have \"scaled the heights of prestige and selectivity and also turn away thousands of our best and brightest young men and women.\"Greene, Howard and Matthew Greene (2000) Greenes' Guides to Educational Planning: The Hidden Ivies: Thirty Colleges of Excellence, HarperCollins, , book description at HarperCollins.com In this book, the authors (using the same criteria often used to evaluate Ivy League schools) discuss 63 American schools that are small in size and are either liberal arts colleges or universities that emulate them. ==Overview== Hidden Ivies discusses the college admissions process and attempts to evaluate 63 colleges in comparison to Ivy League colleges. The schools are examined based on academics, admissions process, financial aid, and student experiences. The book argues the importance of a liberal arts education and goes on to inquire about the qualities of Ivy League schools in general, and how such qualities apply to higher education. === Inclusions === ====Northeast==== *Amherst College *Barnard College *Bates College *Boston College *Bowdoin College *Brandeis University *Bryn Mawr College *Bucknell University *Colby College *Colgate University *College of the Holy Cross *Connecticut College *Dickinson College *Fordham University *Franklin & Marshall College *Hamilton College *Haverford College *Johns Hopkins University *Lafayette College *Lehigh University *Middlebury College *Mount Holyoke College *Skidmore College *Smith College *Swarthmore College *Trinity College *Tufts University *Union College *University of Rochester *Vassar College *Villanova University *Wellesley College *Wesleyan University *Williams College ====South==== *Davidson College *Duke University *Emory University *Georgetown University *Rice University *Sewanee: The University of the South *Southern Methodist University *Tulane University *University of Richmond *Vanderbilt University *Wake Forest University *Washington and Lee University ====Midwest==== *Carleton College *Case Western Reserve University *Denison University *Grinnell College *Kenyon College *Macalester College *Northwestern University *Oberlin College *University of Chicago *University of Notre Dame *Washington University in St. Louis ====West==== *Claremont McKenna College *Colorado College *Pomona College *Reed College *Stanford University *University of Southern California ==See also== * Black Ivy League \u2014 A list of historically black colleges or universities that provide Ivy quality education in a predominantly black environment * Colby-Bates-Bowdoin Consortium \u2014 Athletic grouping of three Maine liberal arts colleges, that are generally considered to give Ivy League caliber education * College admissions in the United States * Jesuit Ivy \u2014 Complimentary use of \"Ivy\" to characterize Boston College * Little Three \u2014 Three liberal arts colleges in New England (Amherst, Wesleyan, and Williams), in contrast to the Big Three of the Ivy League (Harvard, Yale, and Princeton) * Public Ivies \u2014 Group of public US universities thought to \"provide an Ivy League collegiate experience at a public school price\" * Seven Sisters (colleges) \u2014 Historically, these were women's colleges each of which had a close tie to an Ivy League school. * Southern Ivies \u2014 Complimentary use of \"Ivy\" to characterize excellent universities in the US South * Transfer admissions in the United States ==References== ===Footnotes=== ===Bibliography=== * * * ==External links== * Category:Universities and colleges in the United States Category:Books about education Category:University and college admissions .
