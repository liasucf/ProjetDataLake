    "text": "The Joliet Bridge, in Carbon County, Montana near Joliet, Montana, is a Pratt through truss bridge which was built in 1901. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. It is a multiple span road bridge. The main span is a pin-connected steel Pratt truss, about long, resting on concrete abutments and cylindrical piers. On the south end, there are approach spans made of wood stringers (horizontal timbers) supported by timber pile bents; these replaced an original pony truss approach span. The deck is made of wood bridge planks, covered with asphalt. It was designed and built by William S. Hewett, a bridge builder based in Minneapolis, who was low bidder on the contract for the main bridge, at $4,500, and also for an approach span, at $750, which had to be added, perhaps because the original measurements/specification were not adequate. The bridge carries Main Street road over Rock Creek, south of the town.
