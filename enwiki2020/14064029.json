    "text": "The tribunes Hippodrome of Tor di Valle () was an important horse racing venue in the city of Rome. The hippodrome took its name from the area in which it was located and included a racetrack, a training track and a right track. It was one of the biggest of its kind in Europe. Because of its size it often became a location for cultural, musical and social events in the city. The hippodrome was closed in 2013 after an agreement that the new stadium of AS Roma and a business park with skyscrapers by Daniel Liebeskind will be built on its place.http://www.asroma.it/en/news/tor_di_valle- stadio_della_roma_dossier_submitted_today/ == External links == * Julio Lafuente: Tribune dell\u2019Ippodromo di Tor di Valle.
