    "text": "Alden Garrison (1908\u20131938) was a prominent black female impersonator from Washington, DC. He performed at various nightclubs along the Atlantic Seaboard, and the national black press covered his life in detail. Garrison was the child of Rosa Keeling and Will Garrison. He was born on June 4, 1908, and grew up in Washington, DC. At twelve years old, he debuted in a popular local variety show, The Rosetime Revue. Although he danced in costume, he likely did not begin performing as a female impersonator until adulthood. Writing in the Baltimore Afro-American, Ralph Matthews noted that Garrison \u201chiked off to New York and almost became a Gene Malin or a Karyle Norman before he returned to Washington\u201d where he had \u201cunusual success as a night club entertainer.\u201d By 1934, Garrison had won more than twenty \u201cbest dressed\u201d prizes at drag balls in Baltimore and Washington, DC. He reportedly favored squirrel or mink wraps with accessories. Louis Lautier said that Garrison's \u201cfemale impersonation [was] almost perfect.\u201d Amid an increase in policing of gender nonconformity and waning popularity of female impersonators, Garrison had little employment in the last year of his life. Upon his death, the Baltimore Afro-American printed that he \u201chad been melancholy and subject to brooding since the death of his god-mother, who reared him from a child.\u201d Further, he avoided friends and \u201cdrifted around the city during the past few months ill and undernourished.\u201d He had been found lying \u201cprostrate in a vacant lot\u201d and later died in Gallinger Hospital. In 2018, Kim Gallon, a historian at Purdue University, published an extensive account of Garrison's life in the Journal of the History of Sexuality. Gallon's archival research is the most significant source for this Wikipedia entry. == References == Category:1908 births Category:1938 deaths Category:American drag queens Category:Ball culture Category:People from Washington, D.C.
