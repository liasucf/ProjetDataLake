The elevated station is operated by JR East and the underground station is operated by the Toei Subway. Although they are an interchange, passengers must pass through ticket barriers and pay separate fares to switch between services. ===JR East=== Ry\u014dgoku is a local stop on the Ch\u016b\u014d-S\u014dbu Line. \"Rapid\" trains bypass the station through a tunnel whose portal is to the north of the main station complex. The Ch\u016b\u014d-S\u014dbu Line services use an island platform serving two tracks, with platform 1 used for westbound trains to central Tokyo and beyond, and platform 2 for eastbound trains to Chiba. As a remnant of its former terminal days, there is also a third platform (platform 3) at a slightly lower level used for special services only and not used by regular services. ====Platforms==== File:JR Sobu-Main-Line Ryogoku Station West Gates.jpg|West ticket gates File:JR Sobu-Main-Line Ryogoku Station Platform 1\u30fb2 (20191130).jpg|JR platforms ===Toei=== The Toei subway station lies on a north\u2013south axis underneath and has five exits, labelled A1-A5. ====Platforms==== File:Toei-subway-E12-Ryogoku-station- platform-20191123-155950.jpg|Toei platforms ==History== Ry\u014dgoku Station opened on 5 April 1904 as Ry\u014dgokubashi, gaining its current name in 1931.
