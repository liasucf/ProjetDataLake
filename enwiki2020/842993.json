    "text": "Leonardo da Vinci's Lady with an Ermine (1489\u201390) and two portraits by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and Hans Holbein the Younger, inspired the Pullman d\u00e6mon A d\u00e6mon () is a type of fictional being in the Philip Pullman fantasy trilogy His Dark Materials. D\u00e6mons are the external physical manifestation of a person's \"inner-self\" that takes the form of an animal. D\u00e6mons have human intelligence, are capable of human speech - regardless of the form they take - and usually behave as though they are independent of their humans. Pre- pubescent children's d\u00e6mons can change form voluntarily, almost instantaneously, to become any creature, real or imaginary. During their adolescence a person's d\u00e6mon undergoes \"settling\", an event in which that person's d\u00e6mon permanently and involuntarily assumes the form of the animal which the person most resembles in character. D\u00e6mons are usually of the opposite sex to their human, though same-sex d\u00e6mons do exist. Although d\u00e6mons mimic the appearance and behaviour of the animals they resemble perfectly, d\u00e6mons are not true animals, and humans, other d\u00e6mons, and true animals are able to distinguish them on sight. The faculty or quality that makes this possible is not explained in the books, but it is demonstrated extensively, and is reliable enough to allow humans to distinguish a bird-shaped d\u00e6mon within a flock of birds in flight. D\u00e6mons frequently interact with each other in ways that mirror the behaviour of their humans, such as fighting one another when their humans are fighting, or nuzzling one another when their humans embrace, and such contact between d\u00e6mons is unremarkable. Human contact with another individual's d\u00e6mon is taboo. ==Form== In Lyra's world, every human or witch has a d\u00e6mon which manifests itself as an animal.early editions of Northern Lights mention that a deceased scholar's d\u00e6mon had the form of a \"young woman\". However, this was removed in later editions It is separate from and outside its human, despite being an integral part of that person (i.e. they are one entity in two bodies). Humans in every universe are said to have d\u00e6mons, although in some universes they are invisible. In our universe, the books suggest, d\u00e6mons are integrated within the person. They have a naturally occurring external physical manifestation in Lyra's universe and some others. D\u00e6mons that are already physical, such as Lyra's d\u00e6mon Pantalaimon, remain external even when they visit universes with normally-internal d\u00e6mons, such as our own. Typically d\u00e6mons and their humans are conscious or sleep at the same time. However, the d\u00e6mons of witches and shamans, as revealed in The Amber Spyglass, can remain awake while their humans sleep, and it is implied in Northern Lights that cedarwood can have a soporific effect on d\u00e6mons that allows them to sleep even if their humans are awake. \"The worst breach of etiquette imaginable\" is for a human to touch another person's d\u00e6mon; even in battle, most soldiers would never touch an enemy's d\u00e6mon, though there are exceptions (such as between lovers or in particularly violent fights). This was initially presented as a natural taboo that Lyra did not recall ever being told about, but in La Belle Sauvage, the infant Pantalaimon touches Malcolm Polstead's hand while in the form of a kitten, but in context this can be taken as the innocent action of a child seeking comfort from their 'guardian'. The physical handling of a d\u00e6mon causes vulnerability and weakness in the person whose d\u00e6mon is being touched; Lyra feels violated when doctors manhandle her d\u00e6mon into a machine intended to separate them, and later experiences a flush when Pantalaimon licks Will Parry's injuries while in an Irish wolfhound form to comfort him due to Will lacking a d\u00e6mon of his own. However, d\u00e6mons can touch other d\u00e6mons freely; interactions between d\u00e6mons usually accentuate and illuminate the relationships between the characters, and can also be used as a means of passing information between humans without being overheard. The sexual element of human/d\u00e6mon interaction is also reflected when Pantalaimon and Kirjava assume their final forms, as they officially settle after Will and Lyra stroke the other's d\u00e6mon. A child's d\u00e6mon has no fixed form, and may suddenly change into another animal shape according to whim and circumstance. This shape-shifting ability, and the fact that a d\u00e6mon disappears instantly upon its human's death, implies that d\u00e6mons are not completely corporeal. However, their bodies are solid, and they can interact fully with people and objects in the material world. In Northern Lights and The Amber Spyglass, it is noted that Pantalaimon has a heartbeat of his own. During puberty, children's d\u00e6mons \"settle\" into a form which reflects their mature personality. In Northern Lights it is noted that most servants have dog d\u00e6mons (although a maid was noted with a hen d\u00e6mon), and all witches' d\u00e6mons take the form of a bird of some kind. In La Belle Sauvage Malcolm and Alice meet a woman they think of as a fairy who has a flock of butterflies rather than a single d\u00e6mon. At the beginning of the trilogy, Lord Asriel claims that the act of settling triggers Dust to begin to be attracted to the person. A person's d\u00e6mon is usually of the opposite sex to its human; however, very occasionally, it may be the same sex as the person. Pullman has admitted that the reason for this is unknown even to himself, and has agreed that it may also indicate some other gift or quality, such as second sight, or that the person is homosexual, adding \"There are plenty of things about my worlds I don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s one of them\".Interview at Lexicon 2000 The single reference to such individuals is in Northern Lights, where their rarity is established. Mary Malone is taught that, with practice, it is possible to see manifestations of d\u00e6mons in her universe of people who do not even know that they have them. It is revealed in La Belle Sauvage that infant d\u00e6mons must learn to communicate with their humans. Pantalaimon initially 'talks' to Lyra in a style of pidgin English that the nuns caring for Lyra say both will grow out of. It is also established that d\u00e6mons can be injured, at least after settling; the hyena d\u00e6mon of Gerard Bonneville is struck in the leg with a stick, during a fight and is later shown with an amputated leg. ==Separation== Hans Holbein the Younger Lady with a Squirrel (1526-1528) Normally, a person and their d\u00e6mon must stay within a few yards of each other; Lyra Belacqua shows significant discomfort when her d\u00e6mon flies up to the second story window of a tower while she is standing outside the building. Another character expresses surprise when a shaman's d\u00e6mon is able to travel over forty feet from him without discomfort. Such separation from one's d\u00e6mon \u2013 sometimes called \"pulling\" \u2013 causes extreme pain and distress for both human and d\u00e6mon, and, given enough distance, results in death. The most detailed account in the books shows pulling to be torturous both physically \u2013 like \"an iron hand pulling one's heart out between one's ribs\" \u2013 and emotionally. To Will \u2013 who was also enduring the pain of his d\u00e6mon being separated from him for the first time \u2013 it felt as bad as if he had, within his mother's earshot, asked for someone who was about to kill him \"instead to kill his mother because he didn't love her\".The Amber Spyglass, Chap. 21 A permanent separation between human and d\u00e6mon kills both and releases a huge burst of energy, which, for instance, is harnessed by Lord Asriel to blast a hole between two overlapping universes at the end of Northern Lights. The General Oblation Board initially accomplished this separation through simply tearing child and d\u00e6mon apart, but this generally resulted in the subject dying of shock. It is revealed in The Amber Spyglass that certain trained people, particularly witches and human shamans, have achieved the ability to survive separation from their d\u00e6mons by undergoing an initial voluntary separation done at a special location. For the witches this is at a canyon underneath the earth in Lyra's world. Shamans endure gruelling ordeals that involve leaving their d\u00e6mon as they embark on a spiritual quest, crossing an area of death where nothing may grow or live. After rejoining their d\u00e6mon they gain the ability to separate from them to a far greater extent than previously. Both witches and shamans regain their intimate bond with their d\u00e6mon, the only change is in the distance they can travel from each other. Lyra and Will achieve the ability to be distant from their d\u00e6mons by going through the World of the Dead. It is implied that their allies, the Gallivespians, endured a similar experience, but the Gallivespians died before they could meet their d\u00e6mons. Some humans, for example, Mrs. Coulter, are shown to have the ability to go farther from their d\u00e6mons than most others. Mrs. Coulter's d\u00e6mon, a golden monkey, goes into Lyra's room when she is staying with Mrs. Coulter to find her alethiometer (truth reader) despite not having undergone intercision, with Mrs. Coulter talking to Lyra perfectly normally at the same time. The reasons Mrs. Coulter can do this are not stated. In La Belle Sauvage, Malcolm is able to leave his d\u00e6mon Asta hidden under a boat to guard the infant Lyra while he heads further inland to help Alice against Gerard Bonneville, but the effort leaves him gradually weakened the further away he is. Despite this, Malcolm is able to knock Bonneville down and save Alice before returning to Asta. The two are in pain after their reunion, but otherwise unharmed. The Secret Commonwealth establishes that others have undergone separation from their d\u00e6mons or have pushed the bond past its usual limits. On one occasion, Pantalaimon discovers a woman who has become separated from her d\u00e6mon after a boat sank with the d\u00e6mon on it, the two having been unable to find each other after this even as the girl's continued survival makes it clear that the d\u00e6mon is still alive. In Lyra's search for Pantalaimon, after he leaves her following a conflict, Lyra learns that there are groups of poor in distant countries who actually sell their children's d\u00e6mons through an organisation selling d\u00e6mons. ===Intercision=== In the trilogy, a special guillotine made of manganese-titanium alloy is used by the General Oblation Board to separate people from their d\u00e6mon without killing them (known as intercision). However, unlike the distant separation practiced by witches and shamans, the guillotine permanently breaks the bond between person and d\u00e6mon, and drastically reduces the person's creativity, intelligence, and willpower: The adults who have survived the process seem blank and lifeless, and their d\u00e6mons subdued and incurious. The General Oblation Board continually perfects the process through experimentation, but Lyra encounters a young boy who cannot bear the results of his intercision; he physically and mentally deteriorates until he eventually dies. When Lyra finds d\u00e6mons that have been separated from their humans, the creatures are insubstantial and needy: They cluster desperately, held back only by the contact taboo. ==Lifespan== It is uncertain when or how, or into what form, a d\u00e6mon is \"born\", but a baby's d\u00e6mon takes the form of a baby animal.Pullman, Phillip. La Belle Sauvage: The Book of Dust Book One \"[Six-month-old Lyra's] d\u00e6mon, the chick of a small bird like a swallow, was asleep\" When a person dies, their d\u00e6mon fades away like \"atoms of smoke.\" Likewise, when a d\u00e6mon is killed, its human dies as well.Pullman, Philip. The Golden Compass: His Dark Materials Book One. New York: Yearling, 2001. 291. Print. \"A wolf d\u00e6mon leaped at [Iorek Byrnison]: he slashed at her in midair, and bright fire spilled out of her as she fell to the snow, where she hissed and howled before vanishing. Her human died at once.\" How a d\u00e6mon acquires a name is not explained in the books, but clarified by Philip PullmanIRC interview of Philip Pullman by the BBC as being normally given by the parents' d\u00e6mons. As Will Parry came from our world, his d\u00e6mon was not given a name in this way and was named Kirjava (meaning mottled in Finnish) by Serafina Pekkala when she first met the d\u00e6mon. ==Television== While the TV series adheres to most of the established rules about d\u00e6mons from the novels, some extra quirks are added regarding the d\u00e6mons' cultural significance and their relationships with humans. The first episode depicts a gyptian ceremony held to commemorate Tony Costa becoming a man after his d\u00e6mon settles in the form of a hawk, which includes him receiving a silver ring. The second episode confirms that Mrs Coulter is able to separate herself from her d\u00e6mon by a considerably greater distance than others believe possible, with the monkey sneaking around a network of vents in her apartment to spy on others. In the third episode, when Mrs Coulter and her d\u00e6mon fight with a gyptian spy, Mrs Coulter's method of fighting strongly resembles her d\u00e6mon's actions in attacking the gyptian's bird d\u00e6mon, to the point of pinning the gyptian to the ground in a similar manner to the monkey- d\u00e6mon trapping her opponent's bird-d\u00e6mon. On a wider note, the series also affirms that many d\u00e6mons are uncomfortable when meeting new people for the first time, allowing the series to justify why they do not depict d\u00e6mons for every human character every time. ==In other languages== In the Norwegian, Danish, Serbian, Italian, Swedish and Finnish editions of His Dark Materials the word \"d\u00e6mon\" is changed to \"daimon\".See \u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd. In Polish it is \"dajmon\". In Icelandic, the name \"fylgja\" (lit. follower) is used, in reference to the familiar spirits of folk lores. In the Spanish edition, \"daimonion\" is used.Cf. demonio; see \u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd. The Catalan edition uses \"daimoni\". The Portuguese translation renders the word as \"g\u00eanio\" in reference to the familiar spirits in Greco-Roman mythology, although Brazilian new versions use \"dimon\" (older editions used \"d\u00e6mon\"). The Hungarian edition uses \"daim\u00f3n\". In the Hebrew edition, the term is translated phonetically, apart from the mock- bible excerpts quoted in chapter 21 of Northern Lights; there, the word used for d\u00e6mon is \"er'el\", meaning angel, resembling the biblical Hebrew word for foreign gods - \"elil\" (lit. small deity). This reminisces the Greek Septuagint translation of the Old Testament, in which the word \"elil\" was made \"daimon\". The use of the \u00e6 ligature (a and e rendered together as one letter) is old- fashioned English usage, sometimes still seen in words such as \"medi\u00e6val\" and \"arch\u00e6ology\"; in the case of the word d\u00e6mon, it reflects etymologically the original diphthong in Latin daemon and ultimately Greek \u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd daim\u014dn. This ligature is still used in Scandinavian languages; for example in Danish the word is generally spelled \"D\u00e6mon\". ==D\u00e6mons in other literature== D\u00e6mon as a manifestation of a person's soul was described by American sci-fi writer C. L. Moore in a short story \"D\u00e6mon\" (1946). Moore's d\u00e6mons were human-shaped creatures of various colours, following their master wherever he or she goes. They were invisible to ordinary people, but the protagonist, a boy with an intellectual disability, named Luis O'Bobo, was able to see other people's d\u00e6mons. Irish poet W. B. Yeats saw poetic inspiration as being the result of a conflict between the poet and his 'Daemon' (which he considered the disembodied spirits of the dead) in works of occult speculation such as his 1925 work A Vision. In the 1992 novel Aristoi by Walter Jon Williams, the Aristoi (and some others) can split their minds into daimones, or \"limited personalities\", all which can operate as independent mental entities guided by the will of the main 'self' of the Aristos. In the 2010 novel Zoo City by Lauren Beukes, certain characters are physically and metaphysically linked to animals. ==See also== Concepts similar to that of the d\u00e6mon can be found in the belief systems of several cultures, such as Fylgja from Norse mythology, Naguals and Tonals from Aztec mythology, aku-aku from Easter Island, and familiar spirits from early modern English witchcraft. Elsewhere, a parallel can be seen in the Jungian concept of the anima and animus. However, the most famous d\u00e6mon holder was Socrates, who claimed that he could see and talk to his. ;Book pages * Races and creatures in His Dark Materials * List of His Dark Materials characters * Locations in His Dark Materials * His Dark Materials *Northern Lights *The Subtle Knife *The Amber Spyglass *Lyra's Oxford ;Similar concepts *Aku-aku *Anima and animus *Daemon (classical mythology) *Digimon *Familiar spirit *Fylgja *Nagual *Tonal (mythology) ;General *Agathodaemon *Totem *Demon/Daemon (disambiguation) ==References== ==External links== *Philip Pullman Author's website *HisDarkMaterials.com Publisher Random House's His Dark Materials website *Scholastic: His Dark Materials UK publisher's website *Randomhouse: His Dark Materials U.S. publisher's website *BBC Radio 4's His Dark Materials site inc.
