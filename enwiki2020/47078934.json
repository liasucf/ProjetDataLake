The Thapsos civilization developed in the entire Sicily although the main centers, which were sometimes enclosed by a fortification wall, were along the coast. The Thapsos Culture was the subject of great interest of scholars like Paolo Orsi and Luigi Bernab\u00f2 Brea. The research of Voza have confirmed the existence of three evolutionary phases: * Thapsos I prior to Pantalica Culture, * Thapsos II coeval to the latter, * Thapsos III until the end of the Bronze Age. The type of burial found in the necropolis is characterized by large rock-cut chamber tombs and often of tholos-type that some scholars believe it to be of derivation Mycenaean, while others derive it from the shape of the hut. The housing, in small number, are made up of mostly circular huts bounded by stone walls. Some huts have also rectangular shape. The economy was based on farming, herding, hunting and fishing. There are numerous evidences of trading, in particular of bronze vessels and weapons of Mycenaean production. They have established close relationships with the Milazzo Culture of Aeolian Islands and with Apennine culture of the mainland Italy. The material culture includes dark surfaced ceramic, often decorated with incised motifs or with cords that form festoons. Characteristic are the large bowls with high horn-shaped feet, bowls, jugs and cups with bifurcated handles.. == See also == *Castelluccio Culture *Prehistoric Italy *Ancient peoples of Italy ==Notes== == Further reading == * D.
