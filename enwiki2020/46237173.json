    "text": "Backcountry is a 2014 Canadian nature\u2013survival horror film, written and directed by Adam MacDonald. It is loosely based on the true story of a hungry man-eating bear and 30-year-olds Mark Jordan and Jacqueline Perry, in the back country of Missinaibi Lake Provincial Park, North of Chapleau, Ontario in 2005, events for which Mark later received the Star of Courage award from Governor General Micha\u00eblle Jean. Theatrical release was scheduled for August 14, 2015. ==Plot== Alex (Jeff Roop) prepares to take his girlfriend Jen (Missy Peregrym) camping for the weekend. When they arrive, a park ranger tells them the trail Alex wanted to take is closed and suggests they hike elsewhere; Alex refuses a map, confident that he knows the park well. After a canoe trip down river, Alex injures his foot. Night falls and they set up camp. During dinner, they encounter a tour guide called Brad (Eric Balfour) who flirts with Jen, which irritates Alex. Brad implies he would be more suited to take Jen on a hike. Though Alex and Jen initially planned on not hiking far, the next morning Alex decides to go off-trail, deeper into the park where Alex remembers there is a lake with a waterfall. On the way, he spots a bear paw print but does not tell Jen. The pair also discover a mauled, half-devoured deer. When they finally arrive at where Alex believes the lake is, they discover it is not and he realises he is lost. Jen looks for her cell phone but Alex reveals he removed it from her backpack and put it in the car, concerned that it would distract her. He also admits his knowledge of the area is less impressive than he first claimed; he has not hiked the area since high school. Jen lashes out at him, revealing that she never wanted to come on the trip. Alex reveals he was bringing her to the lake to propose. They make camp and Jen apologises, then the two tend to Alex's injured bloody foot, which has unknowingly been attracting predators. During the night as the pair sleep, a bear approaches the camp and sniffs the tent. Later that morning, they find that all of their food has been eaten. As they continue hiking they come across a bear bed, realising they are in dangerous territory, and decide to walk as far as possible before it gets dark. The next morning, Alex awakens to see the bear a few metres from the tent and getting closer. The bear claws through the tent and claws Jen on the arm. Alex, trying to protect her, is attacked too. Jen briefly wards the bear off with bear spray but it returns and drags Alex out of the tent, and begins eating him alive. Jen flees. Now without any food or shelter, Jen sleeps in a tree and wakes up to the sound of a helicopter overhead, but fails to get its attention. Stalked again by the bear, Jen manages to escape it by climbing down the waterfall, but she slips and breaks her ankle. Using a makeshift splint, she limps through the park at night using her road flare as a guide. After collapsing against a tree, suffering from her wounds, she awakes to see a deer grazing in front of her, motivating her to continue. Miraculously, Jen makes it back to their canoe. Paddling back to the lodge, she collapses on the beach in sight of Brad, who is getting ready to lead a tour, and he races over to help her. ==Cast== * Missy Peregrym as Jen * Jeff Roop as Alex * Eric Balfour as Brad * Nicholas Campbell as the Ranger ==Production== Casting began in October 2013 with Missy Peregrym, Eric Balfour, Nicholas Campbell and Jeff Roop being named for the script.
