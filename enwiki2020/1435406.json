However, overseas the name has come to refer to a wider area of ski resorts encompassing Hokkaido's Mount Y\u014dtei, often referred to as the \"Mt. Fuji of Hokkaido\", and Annupuri ranges. The name Niseko derives from the Ainu language, and it means \"a cliff jutting over a riverbank deep in the mountains\". The Niseko town's main industries are agriculture and tourism. The resort itself, Niseko United, is part of the Mountain Collective. Moreover, the town is renowned for its quality powder snow and world-class facilities, including traditional onsen and restaurants. ==Town== The town had an estimated population of 4,938 as of 30 September 2017, and a density of .

Resort Grand Hirafu, refers to the combined areas of Hirafu and Hanazono. Both of these and Weiss are within the municipality of nearby Kutchan. The other three resorts are within the adjacent municipality of Niseko. Of these six ski areas, the main four (Annupuri, Higashiyama, Hirafu, and Hanazono) are sequentially interconnected and may be skied on one ski pass. The lift systems are owned respectively by the Chuo Bus company, YTL Resorts (which purchased Niseko Village from Citigroup in 2010), Tokyu Corporation and Pacific Century Premium Developments. Together they form skiable of what is known as the Niseko United. The lift system comprises 38 gondolas and lifts connecting 61 ski runs and 12 terrain parks. Kutchan's sister city is St. Moritz in a relationship established in 1964. Niseko Moiwa, adjacent to Annupuri, can be skied to from Annupuri but is not currently connected by the lift system. Niseko Weiss has not operated its lifts for decades, but people can still ski in this area, being taken uphill by snow cats. Niseko also has backcountry ski-courses that are unofficially on the maps. To the furthest right of Annupuri lies Sannozaka, an area prone to avalanche but with high quality snow. To the far right of Hirafu lies Higashi One, also prone to avalanche but with challenging backcountry terrain. Near the lower half of Hanazono is a forest route called Strawberry Fields, which is perhaps the most famous run in Niseko. Mount Y\u014dtei is also a popular mountain for backcountry skiing expeditions. For the first time, in March 2008, Niseko was voted into the world's top 10 ski resorts.

Simple public items such as street lighting and winter footpath clearing are left wanting in comparison to other international ski resorts (though this is common in rural Japan). Private infrastructure includes shopping and retail areas from which both are still in growth phase. These facilities are now available in Shiki building in central Hirafu where there is a supermarket, restaurants a cafe and tour desk. Significant infrastructure development \u2013 initially focused on the road heating and redevelopment of the main street \"Hirafu-zaka\" \u2013 has now been completed as well as removing the overhead power lines and relocating them underground. Counteracting this lack of infrastructure is the high demand for real estate. Foreign-owned companies are developing in the area along with Japanese companies. Purchase demand has expanded from Australian markets to include Hong Kong, Singapore and mainland China.
