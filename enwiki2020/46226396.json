    "text": "My Fairy Tales is the fifth album by singer Nneka released on March 2, 2015. It was her first independent release on her own label Bushqueen Music. According to Nneka herself it is \"a project as opposed to a whole album\". Musically there are \"reggae influences as well as Afrobeats and hi-life. Lyrically, it's conscious, it's empowering and it's motivating; discussing political issues, as well as issues that affect us on a day-to-day basis\". == Track listing == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"center\"|# !align=\"center\"|Title !align=\"center\"|Time |- |1 |\"Believe System\" |4:35 |- |2 |\"Babylon\" |4:33 |- |3 |\"My Love, My Love\" |3:32 |- |4 |\"My Love, My Love (Reprise)\" |1:44 |- |5 |\"Local Champion\" |3:30 |- |6 |\"Surprise\" |3:32 |- |7 |\"Pray for You\" |4:01 |- |8 |\"Book of Job\" |4:31 |- |9 |\"In Me\" |4:29 |- |} ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Charts (2015) !Peak position |- |French Albums Chart |align=\"center\"| 133 |- |Swiss Albums Chart |align=\"center\"| 52 |- |} == References == Category:2015 albums Category:Nneka (singer) albums ",
