The Axa Equitable Center (originally The Equitable Tower or Equitable Center West) is an American 752-foot (229.3 m)-tall skyscraper, located at 787 Seventh Avenue between 51st and 52nd Streets in Manhattan, New York City. Edward Larrabee Barnes (April 22, 1915 \u2013 September 22, 2004) was an American architect. Barnes was born in Chicago, Illinois into a family he described as \"incense-swinging High Episcopalians\", consisting of Cecil Barnes, a lawyer, and Margaret Helen Ayer, recipient of a Pulitzer Prize for the novel Year of Grace. He graduated from Harvard in 1938 after studying English and Art History before switching to architecture, then taught at Milton Academy, before returning to Harvard for further studies under Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. He graduated from the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 1942 and served in the Navy during World War II. After the war he worked for Henry Dreyfuss in Los Angeles designing prototypes for mass- produced homes. In 1949 Barnes founded Edward Larrabee Barnes Associates in Manhattan. During his long career, Barnes - with his wife Mary Barnes as interior designer - designed office buildings, museums, botanical gardens, private houses, churches, schools, camps, colleges, campus planning, and housing. Many of his buildings are widely recognized, including the Dallas Museum of Art, Walker Art Center, and the IBM Building at 590 Madison Avenue in Manhattan. Over the years, he also taught at Harvard University, the Pratt Institute, and the University of Virginia, and served as a member of the 'Urban Design Council of New York' and as vice-president of the American Academy in Rome. In 1969, Barnes was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full member in 1974. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978. In 2007 he was posthumously honored with the American Institute of Architects' highest award, the AIA Gold Medal. He also received the Thomas Jefferson Medal in Architecture, the Harvard University 350th Anniversary Medal, and some forty other awards. His Haystack Mountain School of Crafts won the AIA Twenty-five Year Award. In 1993 Barnes announced his retirement but he continued to work as a consultant for Lee / Timchula Architects, founded by Barnes' lead partner, John M.Y. Lee and associate, Michael Timchula. Lee / Timchula inherited various projects that the Barnes' office were awarded. He died in Cupertino, California. His archives are located at Harvard University. == Partners (Firm was renamed Edward Larrabee Barnes and John M.Y.
