The maximum depth of the river is . ==Etymology== The etymology of the word is unclear. However most probably, the origin of the name Vardar derives from Vard\u00e1rios from Thracian, from Proto- Indo-European (PIE) *(s)wordo-wori- (\"black water\").Orel, Vladimir. A Handbook of Germanic Etymology. Leiden, Netherlands: Brill, 2003: 392.Mallory, J.P. and D.Q. Adams. Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture. London: Fitzroy and Dearborn, 1997: 147 It can be considered a translation or similar meaning of Axios, which itself is Thracian for 'not-shining' from PIE *n.-sk(e)i (cf. Avestan ax\u0161a\u0113na (\"dark-coloured\")).Mallory, J.P. and D.Q. Adams. Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture. London: Fitzroy and Dearborn, 1997, p. 146 It is found in another name of the city at the mouth of the Danube, called Ax\u00edopa (\"dark water\") in Thracian, which was later translated into Slavic as Cernavod\u0103 (\u201cblack water\u201d).Kati\u010dic', Radoslav. Ancient Languages of the Balkans. Paris: Mouton, 1976: 149 The name Vard\u00e1rios (\u0392\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2) was sometimes used by the Ancient Greeks in the 3rd century BC. The same name was widely used in the Byzantine era. The word may ultimately be derived from the PIE root wer\u01f5-, which is also the source of the English work. Its Greek name, Axios (\u0391\u03be\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2), is mentioned by Homer (Il. 21.141, Il. 2.849)Axios, Georg Autenrieth, A Homeric Dictionary, at Perseus as the home of the Paeonians allies of Troy. ==Geography== Vardar in Skopje: the Stone Bridge The river rises at Vrutok, a few kilometers southwest of Gostivar in North Macedonia. It passes through Gostivar, Skopje and into Veles, crosses the Greek border near Gevgelija, Polykastro and Axioupoli (\"town on the Axi\u00f3s\"), before emptying into the Aegean Sea in Central Macedonia, west of Thessaloniki in northern Greece. The Vardar basin comprises two-thirds of the territory of North Macedonia. The valley features fertile lands in the Polog region, around Gevgelija and in the Thessaloniki regional unit. The river is surrounded by mountains elsewhere. The superhighways Greek National Road 1 in Greece and M1 and E75 run within the valley along the river's entire length to near Skopje. The river was very famous during the Ottoman Empire and remains so in modern- day Turkey as the inspiration for many folk songs, of which the most famous is Vardar Ovasi. It has also been depicted on the coat of arms of Skopje, which in turn is incorporated in the city's flag.Official portal of the city of Skopje: City symbols. \u2013 Retrieved on 13 May 2009. ==Project to construct the Danube-Vardar-Aegean Canal== The project to construct the Danube-Morava- Vardar-Aegean Canal has been a dream for a long time.The Project to Construct the Danube-Aegean Canal(2013) Le Figaro published a project of Athens and Belgrade on 28.08.2017.

A project worth 17 billion.The Greek-Serbian proposal made in Beijing ==Vardaris wind== The Vardaris or Vardarec is a powerful prevailing northerly ravine wind which blows across the river valley in Greece as well as in North Macedonia. At first it descends along the \"canal\" of the Vardar valley, usually as a breeze. When it encounters the high mountains that separate Greece from North Macedonia, it descends the other side, gathering a tremendous momentum and bringing cold conditions to the city of Thessaloniki and the Axios delta. Somewhat similar to the mistral wind of France, it occurs when atmospheric pressure over eastern Europe is higher than over the Aegean Sea, as is often the case in winter. ==Gallery== File:Northwestern Macedonia.png|Map of the northwestern part of North Macedonia including the source of the Vardar File:Axios-Vardar river map.jpg|Axios/Vardar river map File:Veles Gorge Vardar Macedonia.jpg|Veles Gorge File:River Vardar (2).JPG|River Vardar near Gradsko File:River Vardar (1).JPG|River Vardar near Gradsko (2) File:Axios river.jpg|Vardar (Axios) river in Greece File:\u041d\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0435\u043d \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0438\u043b \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0430\u0440.jpg|Longitudinal hidrographic profile of the flow of river Vardar ==See also== * Great Morava * P\u010dinja River ==References== ==External links== * Proceedings of the 1st Axios Catchment Consortium Meeting by the European Commission\u2014DG Research * PIM \"Ivan Milutinovi\u0107\", Belgrade, Serbia; Morava - Vardar (Axios) Navigation Route\u2014About 1,200 km shorter route (three days shorter time of navigation) from Belgrade to Port of Thessaloniki than across Danube, Black Sea and Aegean Sea.
