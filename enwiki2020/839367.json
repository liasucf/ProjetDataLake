Kikkawa was a retainer of a vassal of the Sh\u014dgun under the M\u014dri clan. However, this castle was dismantled as per the Ikkoku-ichijo (\u4e00\u56fd\u4e00\u57ce, literally, \"One Castle Per Province\") order established by the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1615. The famous Kintai Bridge was originally a bridge to the main gate of the castle. After the destruction of the castle, Kikkawa used a part of the old castle as his residential office. The Kikkawa clan held this castle and Iwakuni Han, which was assessed at 30,000 (later 60,000) koku. A replica of the castle tower stands high on a hill above the Nishiki River and the Kintai Bridge in the city of Iwakuni, Yamaguchi Prefecture. Iwakuni Castle was selected to be one of the 100 Great Castles of Japan by the Japan Castle Foundation in 2006. ==Access== *Iwakuni Station of Sanyo Main Line == See also == * Kintai Bridge * Nishiki River ==References== ==External links== * Iwakuni City Tourism * Iwakuni Kankou.com Category:Castles in Yamaguchi Prefecture Category:100 Fine Castles of Japan ",
