    "text": "Smokey and the Bandit is a 1977 American road action comedy film starring Burt Reynolds, Sally Field, Jackie Gleason, Jerry Reed, Pat McCormick, Paul Williams and Mike Henry. The directorial debut of stuntman Hal Needham, the film follows Bo \"Bandit\" Darville (Reynolds) and Cledus \"Snowman\" Snow (Reed), two bootleggers attempting to illegally transport 400 cases of Coors beer from Texarkana to Atlanta. While the Snowman drives the truck carrying the beer, the Bandit drives a Pontiac Trans Am to distract law enforcement (called blocking) and keep the attention off the Snowman. During their run, they are pursued by Texas county sheriff Buford T. Justice (Gleason). Smokey and the Bandit was the second highest-grossing domestic film of 1977 with $300 million against a budget of $4.3 million (only Star Wars made a higher gross that year, earning $775.5 million). ==Plot== Wealthy Texan Big Enos Burdette (McCormick) and his son, Little Enos (Williams), seek a trucker willing to bootleg Coors beer to the Southern Classic in Atlanta for their refreshment; Big Enos has sponsored a racer in Atlanta's Southern Classic and wants to celebrate in style when he wins. They find local legend Bo \"Bandit\" Darville at a roadeo at Lakewood Fairgrounds and offer him $80,000 to pick up 400 cases of Coors from Texarkana (the closest place it could be legally sold at that time) and bring it back to Atlanta in 28 hours. Despite the fact that the Burdettes have previously offered the same challenge to other truckers who have all failed, as they were all caught, Bandit takes the bet and recruits his partner Cledus \"Snowman\" Snow to drive the truck, while Bandit drives a black Pontiac Trans Am bought on an advance from the Burdettes as a \"blocker\" to divert attention away from the truck and its illegal cargo. They arrive in Texarkana an hour ahead of schedule, load the truck and head back toward Atlanta. Immediately upon starting the second leg of the run, Bandit is stopped by Carrie (\"Frog\") (Field), a runaway bride who hitches a ride, inadvertently making Bandit a target of Sheriff Buford T. Justice, a career Texas lawman whose witless son, Junior (Henry), was to have been Carrie's bridegroom. Buford, with Junior in tow, pursues Bandit all the way to Georgia to get Carrie back, ignoring his own jurisdiction. Various mishaps cause his cruiser to disintegrate on the way. Bandit's antics attract more attention from police throughout Dixie, while Snowman barrels on toward Atlanta with the contraband beer, but they are helped along the way by many colorful characters via CB radio who thwart the police's actions. Neither Buford nor any other lawmen know of Snowman's illegal manifest, while Bandit is likewise unaware that Buford is chasing him because of Carrie. Moments after crossing back into Georgia, Snowman is narrowly rescued by Bandit after being stopped by a Georgia State Patrol motorcycle trooper and state and local police escalate their pursuit with more cruisers, roadblocks and even a police helicopter to track Bandit's movements. Discouraged by the unexpected mounting attention and with just four miles to go until the finish line, Bandit is ready to give up, but Snowman, who was initially skeptical that they could get the job done, refuses to listen and takes the lead, smashing through the police roadblock at the fairgrounds' main entrance. They make it back during the race with only 10 minutes left, but instead of taking the payoff, Carrie and Bandit accept a 'double-or-nothing' offer from Little Enos: a challenge to run up to Boston and bring back clam chowder in 18 hours. They quickly escape in one of Big Enos' 13 Cadillacs as police flood the racetrack. When they pass Buford's badly damaged cruiser by the side of the road, Bandit gets on the CB and first directs him to Big and Little Enos, but then, out of respect, he reveals his true location: over Buford's left shoulder; Buford continues his chase, leaving Junior behind with his cruiser still falling apart as the end credits roll. ==Cast== * Burt Reynolds as Bo Darville (\"Bandit\") * Sally Field as Carrie (\"Frog\") * Jerry Reed as Cledus Snow (\"Snowman\") * Jackie Gleason as Sheriff Buford T.

It was not until Reynolds read the script-- and said he would star-- that the film was aimed at a more mainstream release; Reed would now portray the Bandit's friend the Snowman (Reed would eventually play the Bandit in Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 while Reynolds made a cameo near that film's end). At that time Reynolds was the top box office star in the world. In the original script, Carrie was called Kate while Big Enos and Little Enos were called Kyle and Dickey. The Bandit's car was a second generation Trans Am and the prize for completing the run was a new truck rather than $80,000. Reynolds revealed in his autobiography that Needham had written the first draft script on legal pads. Upon showing it to his friend, Reynolds told Needham that it was the worst script he had ever read, but that he would still make the movie. Most of the dialogue was improvised on set. Universal Studios bankrolled Smokey and the Bandit for $5.3 million, figuring it was a good risk. Just two days before production was to begin, Universal sent a \"hatchet man\" to Atlanta to inform Needham that the budget was being trimmed by $1 million. With Reynolds' salary at $1 million, Needham was left with only $3.3 million to make the film. Needham and assistant director David Hamburger spent 30 hours revising the shooting schedule. \"Buford T. Justice\" was the name of a real Florida Highway Patrolman known to Reynolds' father, who was once Police Chief of Riviera Beach, Florida. His father was also the inspiration for the word \"sumbitch\" used in the film, a variation of the phrase \"son-of-a-bitch\" that, according to Reynolds, he uttered quite often. Gleason was given free rein to ad-lib dialogue and make suggestions. It was his idea to have Junior alongside him throughout. In particular, the scene where Sheriff Justice unknowingly encounters the Bandit in the \"choke and puke\" (a roadside diner) was not in the original story, but was rather Gleason's idea. Reportedly, Needham had great difficulty getting any studios or producers to take his project seriously, as in the film industry, he was better known as a stuntman. He managed to obtain studio attention after his friend Reynolds agreed to portray the Bandit in the film. The film's theme song, \"East Bound and Down,\" was written virtually overnight by Reed. He gave Needham a preview of the song and when he initially got no reaction from the director, offered to rewrite the song. Needham, however, liked the song so much, he assured Reed not to change a word; it would became one of Reed's biggest hits and his signature song. The film features the custom clothing and costuming of Niver Western Wear of Fort Worth, Texas.Niver Western Wear Corporate Records Niver provided much of the western attire worn in the film, as well as the custom-made sheriff's uniforms (waist size 64\") that Gleason wore throughout the film. While made to take advantage of the ongoing 1970s CB radio fad, the film added to the craze. Though the film Moonrunners (1975) is the precursor to the television series The Dukes of Hazzard (1979-1985), from the same creator and with many identical settings and concepts, the popularity of Smokey and the Bandit and similar films helped get the Dukes series on the air. Three actors from the main cast of The Dukes of Hazzard appear in small uncredited roles in Smokey and the Bandit: Ben Jones, John Schneider and Sonny Shroyer (who played a police officer in both). In return, Reynolds portrayed the Dukes character Boss Hogg (originally portrayed by Sorrell Booke) in the film adaptation The Dukes of Hazzard (2005). Reynolds is also referenced by name in several early episodes of the series. ===Casting=== Before Gleason was cast in the film, Richard Boone was originally considered for the role of Buford T. Justice. Sally Field only accepted the part after her agent advised her that she needed a big movie role on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Reynolds actively pushed for her casting after Universal initially resisted, claiming Field was not attractive enough. Field enjoyed making the film, but remembers that virtually the entire project was improvised.https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/blog/8-sally-field\u2019s-most- memorable-characters ===Filming=== Principal photography of the film began in late August 30, 1976.http://www.atlantatimemachine.com/smokey/poster.htm The movie was primarily filmed in Georgia, in the cities of McDonough, Jonesboro and Lithonia. The scenes set in Texarkana were filmed in Jonesboro and the surrounding area and many of the chase scenes were filmed in the surrounding areas on Highway 54 between Fayetteville and Jonesboro for a majority of the driving scenes, Mundy's Mill Road, Main Street in Jonesboro, Georgia State Route 400, I-85 (Pleasant Hill exit) and in McDonough. However, the scene where they drive through the Shell gas station was filmed in Ojai, California on the corner of Ojai Avenue and El Paseo Road. Much of the surrounding scene comes from that immediate vicinity. The scene featuring the racetrack was filmed at Lakewood Speedway at the old Lakewood Fairgrounds on Atlanta's south side. The roller coaster seen in the movie was the Greyhound. It had not been used for some time and was repainted for the film. It was destroyed in Smokey and the Bandit II and a flashback scene in Part 3. The area around Helen, Georgia was also used for some locations. The scene where Sheriff Justice's car has the door knocked off by a passing semi truck was shot on Georgia State Route 75, north of Helen. The tow truck driver was a local garage owner, Berlin Wike. Reynolds and Field began dating during the filming.https://worldgarages.com/news/Burt-Reynolds-old-Pontiac-Trans-Am- replica-sold-for-317500 ===Vehicles=== Needham saw an advertisement for the soon-to-be-released 1977 Pontiac Trans Am and knew right away that would be the Bandit's car, or, as Needham referred to it, a character in the movie. He contacted Pontiac and an agreement was made that four 1977 Trans Ams and two Pontiac LeMans 4-door sedans would be provided for the movie. The Trans Ams were actually 1976-model cars with 1977 front ends. (From 1970-1976, both the Firebird/Trans Am and Chevrolet Camaro had two round headlights and in 1977, the Firebird/Trans Am was changed to four rectangular headlights, while the Camaro remained unchanged.) The decals were also changed to 1977-style units, as evidenced by the engine size callouts on the hood scoop being in liters rather than cubic inches, as had been the case in 1976. The hood scoop on these cars says \"6.6 LITRE,\" which, in 1977, would have denoted an Oldsmobile 403-equipped car or a non W-72, 180 hp version of the 400 Pontiac engine. The cars being 1976 models, the engines fitted to them were actually 455ci powerplants, the last year these engines were offered for sale before withdrawal.http://www.iconicpremier.world/smokey-and-the-bandit-trans-am- collectors/ All four of the cars were badly damaged during production, one of which was all but destroyed during the jump over the dismantled Mulberry bridge. The Trans Am used for said jump was equipped with a booster rocket, the same type that was used by Evel Knievel during his failed Snake River Canyon jump. Needham served as the driver for the stunt (standing in for Reynolds) while Lada St. Edmund was in the same car (standing in for Field during the jump). By the movie's ending, the final surviving Trans Am and LeMans were both barely running and the other cars had become parts donors to keep them running. Notably, this gives rise to various continuity errors with Justice's patrol car, which during some chase sequences is shown with a black rear fender, which then reverts to the car's bronze color again in later scenes. When it is finally torn off along with the car's roof in the impact with the girder, the missing fender still reappears later on in the film. The Burdettes' car is a 1974 Cadillac Eldorado convertible painted in \"Candy Red\" color scheme and is seen briefly at the beginning of the movie and in the final scene as the Bandit, the Snowman, Fred the dog and Frog use it to make their escape. The film also made use of three Kenworth W900A short-frame semi trucks, which Reed can be seen driving, each equipped with 38-inch sleepers. Two units were 1974 models as evidenced by standard silver Kenworth emblems on the truck grille and one unit was a 1973 model as evidenced by the gold- painted Kenworth emblem on the truck's grille signifying Kenworth's 50 years in business. The paint code for each truck was coffee brown with gold trims and the mural trailer used was manufactured by Hobbs Trailers in Texas with a non-operational Thermo King Refrigeration unit. This is obvious, because there is no fuel tank on the underside of the trailer to power the refrigeration unit, and the unit is never heard running. ===Legal status of Coors beer=== In 1977, Coors was unavailable for sale east of Oklahoma. A 1974 Time magazine article explains why Coors was so coveted that one would be willing to pay the Bandit such a high price to transport it. Coors Banquet Beer had a brief renaissance as certain people sought it out for its lack of stabilizers and preservatives. The article says that future Vice President Gerald Ford hid it in his luggage after a trip to Colorado in order to take it back to Washington, D.C. President Dwight D. Eisenhower had a steady supply airlifted to Washington by the Air Force. Carl Yastrzemski of the Boston Red Sox would bring several cases back with him on the team plane, after playing opposing teams on the West Coast, by stashing it in the team's equipment trunks. The article also mentions Frederick Amon, who smuggled it from Colorado to North Carolina and sold it for four times the retail price. The lack of additives and preservatives meant that Coors had the potential for spoiling in a week if it were not kept cold throughout its transportation and in storage at its destination. This explains the 28-hour deadline. ==Soundtrack== The theme music \"East Bound and Down\" was sung and co-written by Reed (credited under his birth name, Jerry Hubbard) and Dick Feller. It became Reed's signature song and is found on multiple albums, including Country Legends and his live album Jerry Reed \"Live!\" (Still). In 1991, it was arranged for orchestra by Crafton Beck and recorded by Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra for their album Down on the Farm. Several other groups, such as U.S. rock band Tonic and U.K. based country covers band We Be Ploughin' have also covered it. Reed also penned and performed the song for the opening credits, entitled \"The Legend,\" which tells of some of the Bandit's escapades prior to the events of the film and the ballad \"The Bandit,\" which features in several versions in the movie and on the soundtrack. Reed's hit notwithstanding, Bill Justis is the first name on the credits for the soundtrack, as he composed and arranged original music throughout the film. Musicians such as Beegie Adair and George Tidwell played on the soundtrack as part of long careers in music. Legendary five-string banjo player Bobby Thompson is also heard prominently towards the end of \"East Bound and Down.\" The soundtrack album was released in 1977 on vinyl, cassette and 8-track through MCA Records. ===Track listing=== ==Reception== ===Box office=== Smokey and the Bandit was a sleeper hit. The film premiered at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, where it performed badly. It then opened in just the South of the United States over the Memorial Day weekend and grossed $2,689,851 in 386 theaters. By the end of June, it had played in major Southern markets, including Charlotte, Atlanta, Jacksonville, New Orleans, Memphis, Dallas and Oklahoma City, grossing $11.9 million. It opened in other Northern states at the end of July. With an original budget of $5.3 million (cut to $4.3 million two days before initial production), the film eventually grossed $126,737,428 in North America, making it the second- highest-grossing movie of 1977 (only Star Wars earned more, with $775.5 million). The worldwide gross is estimated at over $300 million. Reynolds rated the film as the one he most enjoyed and had the most fun making in his career. ===Critical response=== Film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film a good rating (3 stars out of a possible 4) and characterized it as \"About as subtle as The Three Stooges, but a classic compared to the sequels and countless rip-offs which followed.\" In his own review in the Chicago Tribune, Gene Siskel gave the film two stars and complained that the film failed to tell the audience when the clock started on the beer run, thus removing suspense throughout the film concerning how long remained to them. He also claimed that the Bandit is never made aware of Frog's leaving Junior at the altar, which is why the Bandit continually asks why a Texas sheriff is chasing him.Siskel, Gene (August 4, 1977). \"The game is good news in 'Bears'\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 6. However, this is inaccurate: within seconds of Bandit picking her up, Frog tells him \"there is a wedding in search of a bride\" and goes on to explain her ill-advised romance with Junior, as the Bandit holds up the CB mic for the Snowman to hear. The film's editors, Walter Hannemann and Angelo Ross, were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, it has an 80% rating based on 30 reviews. The site's consensus states; \"Not much in the head but plenty beneath the hood, Smokey and the Bandit is infectious fun with plenty of car wrecks to keep your eyes glued.\" Alfred Hitchcock stated that the film was one of his favorites. Upon meeting Reynolds, Billy Bob Thornton told him that the picture was not considered a \"film\" in the South so much as a documentary. Smokey and the Bandit was released in the United Kingdom on August 28, 1977 and was a sizeable success there, garnering positive reviews.

Reynolds was given the 1977 vehicle used during promotion of the film as a gift, though the car itself never actually appeared in the film. Because of the popularity of the movie and the sales success of the Trans Am, then-President of Pontiac Alex Mair promised to supply Reynolds with a Trans Am each year. Owing to his financial difficulties, in 2014, Reynolds put his vast collection of artwork and memorabilia up for auction, including the Trans Am. High estimates for the car were up to $80,000, but that was dwarfed by the actual sale price of $450,000. Also up for auction was a go-kart replica of the car, which sold for nearly $14,000. In 2015, Trans Am Depot, a Florida-based automobile customization company, announced that it would build 77 Trans Ams that would be modeled after the car that Reynolds drove in the film. Pontiac was discontinued by GM in 2009 and Trans Am Depot has permission to use the Trans Am name. These new models were built off the Camaro platform (the very same one that the real Firebird and Trans Am used), came with Pontiac arrowhead, flaming bird and Bandit logos, as well as instrument panels, center consoles and hood scoops emulating their 1977 counterparts and were signed by Reynolds. Some differences included the use of a supercharged 454-cid (7.4-liter) Chevrolet- sourced engine that put out 840 HP, and four round headlights, which appeared on the 1967-69 Firebirds/Trans Ams only; the actual 1977-81 models had rectangular headlights. ===Diablo sandwich=== The \"diablo sandwich\" ordered by Sheriff Justice in the Arkansas barbecue restaurant scene has entered popular culture as a minor reference to the film. While no authoritative source identifies the composition of the sandwich, there are several possibilities. A segment of the CMT program Reel Eats used a sloppy joe-style recipe consisting of seasoned ground beef, corn and sour cream. Another proposal, based more closely on images from the film and the shooting location of the scene (at an Old Hickory House restaurant in Georgia), is pulled pork and hot sauce on a hamburger bun. Other sources in East Texas (whence Sheriff Justice hails) are familiar with the popular regional delicacy known as the Diablo Sandwich. It consists of any of the various Louisiana-style hot sauces on Texas Toast-style bread alongside the fourth most famous product of Pittsburg, Texas (behind Pilgrim's Pride, Cavender's and Carroll Shelby)-- Pittsburg Hot Links. ===The Bandit Run=== First run in 2007 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the movie, The Bandit Run was the brainchild of Dave Hall, owner of Restore A Muscle Car. A group of Trans Am owners and fans of the movie take part in an annual road trip from Texarkana to Jonesboro, recreating the route taken by the characters in the film. The Bandit Run quickly caught on and has become a fixture, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the movie with a special 2017 screening of the film attended by Reynolds and a recreation of the jump undertaken by the Bandit and Frog across a river. ===Mobil 1 commercial=== In 2014, petroleum company Mobil 1 produced television commercials, featuring then-NASCAR driver Tony Stewart, closely based on the film. Called Smoke is the Bandit and playing on Stewart's nickname, the commercials featured him as the Bandit opposite commentators Darrell Waltrip as the Snowman and Jeff Hammond as Buford T. Justice. The story replaced the Coors beer with Mobil 1 products. The adverts poked fun at the film and even featured a Pontiac Trans Am and a cover version of the song East Bound and Down. The commercials were produced after Stewart mentioned that the movie was one of his favorites. ==Television censorship and alternative versions== When Smokey and the Bandit first aired on American network television in the early 1980s, censors were faced with the challenge of toning down the raw language of the original film. For this purpose, they overdubbed dialogue deemed offensive, which was (and remains, to an extent) common practice. The most noted change made for network broadcast was the replacing of Buford's often-spoken phrase \"sumbitch\" (a contraction of \"son of a bitch\"; usually in reference to the Bandit) with the phrase \"scum bum.\" This phrase achieved a level of popularity with children and the 2007 Hot Wheels release of the 1970s Firebird Trans Am has \"scum bum\" emblazoned on its tail. The TV prints of the first two Bandit films are still shown regularly on television, although a few TV stations aired the unedited version in recent years as some of the phraseology (i.e. \"(son of a) bitch,\" \"ass,\" etc.) became more acceptable on TV. Except for Gleason, the original actors mostly redubbed their own lines for the television version. Actor Henry Corden, who voiced Fred Flintstone after original performer Alan Reed died the same year the film was released, was used to replace a considerable amount of Sheriff Justice's dialogue. In the U.K., the heavily dubbed version was shown for a number of years, particularly by the BBC. However, in more recent years, the original version has been shown (on ITV, a commercial channel), usually with the stronger language edited out, often quite awkwardly and noticeably. The theatrical release itself had a few lines deleted, including an edit in which Sheriff Justice tells a state trooper to \"fuck off\" after the sheriff called his vehicle \"a piece of crap.\" His expletive is obscured when a passing big rig sounds its horn. At the time, using the 'F' word would immediately require an R rating and this self-censorship allowed the film to avoid this rating and reach a much larger audience. However, the scene and the obscured expletive were played for comedy value and written as such, with the passing truck being the gag of the scene more than a way to avoid the censors. In 2006, a DVD re-release was issued of Smokey and the Bandit featuring a digitally remastered audio track with 5.1 Dolby-compatible surround sound. Many of the film's original sounds were replaced. For instance, the diesel engine start and run-up sequence in the opening sequence of the film was completely dubbed over with a totally new sound. A few other examples of \"sound effect replacement\" occur when the Bandit takes off after getting a reluctant Cledus involved in the bet, the Bandit coming to a screeching halt on a roadway moments before picking up Carrie and when Buford\u2019s car top comes off. Some of the original sound effects (such as Cledus' dog Fred barking) and music (such as the final chase to the Southern Classic) were removed and not replaced (Note: earlier DVD releases and the 40th Anniversary Blu-ray of the film have the original soundtrack intact). Major portions of the audio 'background' have been modified with different engine sounds or tire squeals from the original film. The updated version of the film features sounds inaccurate for what would be produced by the Trans Am or the numerous other Pontiac vehicles in the film. The original film had correct sounds that were usually recorded live as the action took place. ==Sequels== The film was followed by two sequels: Smokey and the Bandit II (1980) and Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 (1983). The second film was a box office success, earning $66.1 million against a $17 million budget while the third was a box office bomb, earning only $7 million against a $9 million budget.Box Office Information for Smokey and the Bandit Part 3. The Numbers. Retrieved April 1, 2013 ==Television spin-off films== A series of four made-for-TV spin-off films (Bandit Goes Country, Bandit Bandit, Beauty and the Bandit and Bandit's Silver Angel) were produced in 1994 for Universal Television's Action Pack with actor Brian Bloom playing a younger version of the Bandit. The three original films introduced two generations of the Pontiac Trans Am and the Dodge Stealth in the television movies. ==See also== * The Bandit Run * The Cannonball Run * Hooper ==References== ==External links== * * * * * * Category:1977 films Category:1970s action comedy films Category:1970s comedy road movies Category:1970s chase films Category:American films Category:American action comedy films Category:Country music films Category:American comedy road movies Category:American chase films Category:English-language films Category:Fictional smugglers Category:Films about automobiles Category:Films about beer Category:Films directed by Hal Needham Category:Films set in Alabama Category:Films set in Arkansas Category:Films set in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Films set in Mississippi Category:Films set in Texas Category:Films shot in Atlanta Category:Films shot in California Category:Films shot in Florida Category:Films shot in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Trucker films Category:Films with screenplays by Charles Shyer Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Citizens band radio in popular culture Category:1977 directorial debut films Category:Pontiac Category:1977 comedy films ",
