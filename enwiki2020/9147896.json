In 1972, Ole`s son Odd Reitan started his own shop. He had returned from his education at the Retailing institute (Kj\u00f8pmannsinstituttet, now BI Retail) in B\u00e6rum outside Oslo, and started the shop Sjokkpris (\"shock price\") in St. Olav's street in Trondheim. Father and son ran the business together as partners, and more shops were opened during the 70s. Based on an idea from abroad, Odd Reitan then established the retail chain REMA 1000 (REitan MAt, \"Reitan food\") in 1979. The chain concept consisted of a standardised range of goods (in principle 1,000), a simple shop design and low prices. REMA 1000 was a breakthrough for discount grocery chains in Norway. In 1994, the first REMA 1000 store opens in Denmark. In 1995, Reitan Eiendom (Reitangruppen\u2019s real estate business) is established. In 2000, Rema 1000 and Narvesen merges. In coming years Reitangruppen takes control over Reitan Narvesen AS and in 2004 Reitan Convenience is in charge of the brands Narvesen and 7-Eleven. In 2006, Reitangruppen buys Hydro Texaco in Norway and Denmark and establishes a focused corporate structure based on the Uno-X and YX station networks in each country. In 2007, Reitan Convenience cooperates with Shell and the convenience part of the gas stations becomes 7-Eleven. In 2012, Reitan Convenience buys R-Kioski with stores in Finland, Estonia and Latvia and Lietuvos Spauda in Lithuania. In 2016, the fifth business area, Reitan Kapital is established. In 2017, The first YX/7-Eleven opens in Norway. In 2019, Reitan Convenience buys Caffeine Roasters with stores in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. In 2019, after three years of refurbishing, Odd Reitan fulfill his childhood dream by opening Britannia Hotel, a five star hotel in Trondheim. ==References== Category:Wholesalers of Norway Category:Retail companies of Norway Category:Holding companies of Norway Category:Companies formerly listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange Category:Companies based in Trondheim ==External links== * Official English-language website ",
