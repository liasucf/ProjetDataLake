    "text": "This is page shows results of Canadian federal elections in the province of Manitoba outside the Winnipeg area. ==Regional profile== Rural Manitoba is, for the most part, a strongly conservative area (especially on social issues), though it becomes far less strident the further one gets from the U.S. border. The rural portions of southern Manitoba are similar to the rural portions of the Central United States, as well as rural portions of Saskatchewan and Alberta. Not only are they heavily agricultural, but they are some of the most religious areas in Canada. The Conservatives hold all five rural ridings in the south, with their largest margins of victory in the three ridings on the U.S. border. The Liberals swept the region in 1993, and managed to hold onto two ridings here in 1997. However, they have barely been on the radar screen since the turn of the millennium. Northern Manitoba is home to only one riding - Churchill, which has been in NDP hands for all but six years since 1979. Former NDP MP Bev Desjarlais lost the nomination in 2006 and ran unsuccessfully as an independent; the Liberals were able to pick up Churchill with star candidate Tina Keeper. The NDP won it back in the next election, however. ==2015 - 42nd General Election== ==2011 - 41st General Election== ==2008 - 40th General Election== ==2006 - 39th General Election== ==2004 - 38th General Election== Key map #Brandon-Souris #Churchill #Dauphin-Swan River-Marquette #Portage-Lisgar #Provencher #Selkirk-Interlake Image:rmcpc.PNG|Conservative Party of Canada Image:rmgpc.PNG|Green Party of Canada Image:rmlpc.PNG|Liberal Party of Canada Image:rmndp.PNG|New Democratic Party ==References== Category:Canadian federal election results in Manitoba ",
