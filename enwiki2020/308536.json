He used the title Duke of Braganza. ==Early life== Miguel with his first wife Princess Elisabeth of Thurn and Taxis, late 1870s Miguel was born in Castle Kleinheubach near Miltenberg, Kingdom of Bavaria, on 19 September 1853 during the exile in Germany of his father, former King Miguel I of Portugal and the Algarves. His mother was Princess Adelaide of L\u00f6wenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. He was a grandson of King John VI of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves and his wife, Queen Carlota Joaquina. By the Portuguese law of banishment of 1834 and the constitution of 1838, King Miguel was forbidden to enter Portugal. Therefore, he was educated in Germany and Austria. ==Career== He was a member of the staff of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria and took part in the Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878. It is said that the Emperor liked Miguel immensely and granted him the privilege of extraterritoriality that allowed him to remain Portuguese, despite the rejection of Portugal. His second son, Prince Francisco Jos\u00e9 of Braganza, was named after the Austrian Emperor, who was his godfather. Miguel held the rank of a colonel in the 7th Austrian Regiment of Hussars. During World War I, he held the rank of Lieutenant General (Feldmarschalleutnant) in the Austro-Hungarian Army. He resigned in 1917 when Portugal entered the conflict on the opposite side, and spent the rest of the war as a civilian in the Order of Malta. After the end of Austria-Hungary, Miguel and his family were thrown into relative poverty. On 31 July 1920, after quarrels with his eldest son (who contracted a controversial marriage to an American heiress), Miguel renounced his claims as King of Portugal in favour of his third son, Duarte Nuno, who was 13 years old at the time. ==Marriages and children== Miguel was first married to Princess Elisabeth of Thurn and Taxis (May 28, 1860 \u2013 February 7, 1881), the niece of Empress Elisabeth of Austria, on 17 October, 1877 in Regensburg.
