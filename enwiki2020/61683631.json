    "text": "\"Enemies\" is a song by American rapper Post Malone featuring American rapper DaBaby. It was sent to rhythmic contemporary radio as the fourth single from Post Malone's third studio album, Hollywood's Bleeding on September 17, 2019. The song was written by Austin Post, Jonathan Kirk, Louis Bell, and Billy Walsh while production was handled by Louis Bell. The track became Malone's seventh number one (and his fourth from Hollywood's Bleeding) and DaBaby's first on Billboards Rhythmic Songs Chart in November 2019.\"Post Malone's 'Enemies' Conquers Rhythmic as His Radio Reach Expands\" from Billboard (November 26, 2019) The song peaked at number 16 on the US Billboard Hot 100. ==Critical reception== The song received acclaim mostly for DaBaby's guest appearance. Jayson Greene at Pitchfork praised DaBaby's guest verse on the song, noting that he \"crushes his turn\". Writing for Vulture, Craig Jenkins thought that DaBaby even \"stole the show\" on the song and described his verse as a \"passive-aggressive jab at backstabbing friends\". However, in a review of the song's parent album, Chris DeVille from Stereogum opined that DaBaby along with Meek Mill merely delivered \"the requisite rap verse on a Top 40 single\". Rolling Stones Nick Catucci pointed out how DaBaby's flow \"highlights Post Malone's technical laxity as a rapper, but also his unerring instinct for what will cut through the ambient noise in the car, at the supermarket or during hour four of the frat party\". ==Personnel== Credits adapted from Tidal. * Post Malone \u2013 vocals, songwriting * DaBaby \u2013 featured vocals, songwriting * Louis Bell \u2013 production, recording, vocal production, programming, songwriting * Billy Walsh \u2013 songwriting * Manny Marroquin \u2013 mixing * Chris Galland \u2013 mixing assistant * Robin Florent \u2013 mixing assistant * Scott Desmarais \u2013 mixing assistant * Jeremie Inhaber \u2013 mixing assistant ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Denmark (Tracklisten) | 25 |- ! scope=\"row\"| France (SNEP) | 159 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Greece (IFPI) | 62 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Italy (FIMI) | 59 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania (AGATA) | 28 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) | 37 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Norway (VG-lista) | 17 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) | 32 |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Rolling Stone Top 100 | 4 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal (AFP) | 814 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard) | 84 |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" ! scope=\"col\"| Country ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| Various | September 6, 2019 | | rowspan=\"2\"| Republic | align=\"center\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| United States | September 17, 2019 | Rhythmic contemporary radio | align=\"center\"| |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 songs Category:2019 singles Category:Post Malone songs Category:DaBaby songs Category:Songs written by Louis Bell Category:Songs written by Post Malone Category:Songs written by DaBaby Category:Song recordings produced by Louis Bell ",
