    "text": "The 2020 United States Senate election in Iowa will be held on November 3, 2020, to elect a member of the United States Senate to represent the State of Iowa, concurrently with the 2020 U.S. presidential election, as well as other elections to the United States Senate in other states and elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Primaries were held on June 2. ==Republican primary== ===Candidates=== ====Nominee==== *Joni Ernst, incumbent U.S. Senator ====Withdrawn==== *Paul Rieck ===Endorsements=== ===Results=== ==Democratic primary== On June 2, 2020, Theresa Greenfield won the Democratic primary with 47.71% of the vote, defeating three other major candidates, including Michael T. Franken, a retired U.S. Navy admiral and former aide to U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy. Greenfield grew up on a small farm where her family raised raised crops and hogs. She took courses at Iowa Lakes Community College and Iowa State University before graduating from Minnesota State University, Mankato in 1987 with a bachelor's degree in design and human environment. At 24 years old, Greenfield's husband, an electrician, was killed in a work accident. She has credited Social Security, workers' compensation, and family support with helping her through that period, during which she was caring for a one-year- old son and pregnant with a child born five months later. In 2005, Greenfield took a position at the homebuilding company Rottlund Homes, where she was named president of the Iowa division in 2007. In 2012, Greenfield became president of the Des Moines commercial real estate firm Colby Interests, based in Windsor Heights, Iowa. ===Candidates=== ====Nominee==== *Theresa Greenfield, businesswoman, candidate for Iowa's 3rd congressional district in 2018 ====Eliminated in primary==== *Michael T.

Polls conducted after the primary have shown a close contest between Greenfield and Ernst, with neither candidate leading by more than 4 points. As of September 5, 2020, political handicappers The Cook Political Report and Sabato's Crystal Ball rate the race as a toss-up. Through June 2020, Greenfield had raised $11.5 million, compared to $14.6 million for Ernst but by September, Greenfield had pulled ahead, raising $40.0 million compared to $21.6 million for Ernst.https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/18/2020-election- iowa-senate-greenfield-ernst-campaign-political-ads- records/3638224001/https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2020&id;=IAS2 The race is expected to be the most expensive in the state's history, and the second most expensive Senate race in the United States, after the 2020 United States Senate election in North Carolina, where Cal Cunningham is challenging Thom Tillis. On October 17, the Des Moines Register endorsed Greenfield, saying she \"should be given an opportunity to refocus the junior senator\u2019s office on working Iowans\", criticising Ernst for increasing the deficit with tax cuts for wealthy corporations. === Debate === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! rowspan=\"2\" |Host ! rowspan=\"2\" |Date & Time ! rowspan=\"2\" |Link(s) ! colspan=\"2\" |Participants |- !Joni Ernst (R) !Theresa Greenfield (D) |- | align=\"center\" |Iowa Press Debates | align=\"center\" |September 28, 2020 | align=\"center\" | | | |} === Predictions === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Source !Ranking !As of |- | align=left | The Cook Political Report | |October 13, 2020 |- | align=left | Inside Elections | |October 16, 2020 |- | align=left | Sabato's Crystal Ball | | October 20, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |Daily Kos | | October 19, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |Politico | |October 12, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |RCP | |October 7, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |Niskanen | |October 13, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |DDHQ | |October 14, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |538 | |October 18, 2020 |} ===Endorsements=== ===Polling=== ====Graphical summary==== ====Aggregate polling==== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ !colspan=\"7\"|Theresa Greenfield vs. Joni Ernst |- !Source of poll aggregation !Dates administered !Dates updated !Theresa Greenfield !Joni Ernst !Other/Undecided !Margin |- |Real Clear Politics |September 14 - October 9, 2020 |October 16, 2020 ||47.3% |42.5% |10.2% ||Greenfield +4.8 |- |270 to Win |September 24 - October 11, 2020 |October 16, 2020 ||47.8% |44.2% |8.8% ||Greenfield +3.6 |- |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;\" |- valign=bottom !
