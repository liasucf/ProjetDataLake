    "text": "Buena Park is a train station in Buena Park, California, United States, served by Metrolink commuter rail. It is at the center of a transit-oriented development including townhomes and a housing complex owned by the California State University, Fullerton, near the corner of Dale Street and Malvern Avenue. The station is served by Metrolink's Orange County Line and 91 Line. The station has a clock tower nearly 70 feet high which echoes a clock tower at nearby Knott's Berry Farm, itself a copy of Independence Hall in Philadelphia. The station includes a 300-car parking lot and a covered pedestrian overpass to allow passengers to cross the tracks. Construction started in January 2006, and after many delays, the station opened on September 4, 2007. Construction cost $14 million. The proposed alignment for the California High-Speed Rail project would require the loss of the station or the demolition of about 25 condominiums. The City of Buena Park joined other area municipalities to demand greater consultation from the High-Speed Rail Commission. In response, the California High-Speed Rail Authority agreed to study the possibility of a \"shared-track alignment\" between Los Angeles and Anaheim that would not require the demolition of the present station or condominiums. Amtrak(s) Pacific Surfliner and Southwest Chief passes through the station and does not stop in Buena Park. ==Services== === Rail === Buena Park is served by Metrolink's Orange County and 91/Perris Valley Lines.
