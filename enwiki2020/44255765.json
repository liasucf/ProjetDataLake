    "text": "Nicholas Jamaal Chubb (born December 27, 1995) is an American football running back for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Georgia and was drafted by the Browns in the second round of the 2018 NFL Draft. ==Early years== Chubb attended Cedartown High School in Cedartown, Georgia, where he was a two-sport star for the Bulldogs; football and track teams. In football, he led the state of Georgia in rushing yards with 2,721 with 38 touchdowns as a junior. As a senior, he had 2,690 yards and 41 touchdowns. He finished his high school career with 6,983 rushing yards and 102 rushing touchdowns. As a standout track & field athlete, Chubb competed from 2011 to 2015 in events ranging from the 100-meters to the shot put. At the 2013 4A Sectionals, he took fifth place in the long jump event with a leap of 6.85 meters (22 ft, 4 in). At the 2014 4A Sectionals, he won the shot put event, recording a top-throw of 17.05 meters (55 ft, 8in), and earned second- place finishes in both the 100-meter dash, with a time of 10.69 seconds (setting a school record), and the 200-meter dash, with a time of 21.83 seconds. He captured the state title in the shot put at the 2014 Class AAAA with a throw of 16.77 meters (55 ft). Chubb was ranked by both Rivals.com and Scout.com as a four-star recruit. In June 2013, he committed to the University of Georgia to play college football under head coach Mark Richt. ==College career== Chubb in 2018. Chubb entered his true freshman season as a backup to starter and future NFL running back Todd Gurley. After Gurley was suspended, Chubb took over as the starter. In his first start, he rushed for 143 yards on 38 carries at Missouri. The next game, he rushed for 202 yards and two touchdowns on 30 carries against Arkansas. In the 2014 Belk Bowl against Louisville, Chubb broke the bowl game record with 266 rushing yards and was named the Belk Bowl MVP. Chubb finished his freshman season with 1,547 rushing yards, good for second in the SEC, despite starting just eight games. After the Alabama game on October 3, 2015, he tied with Herschel Walker with 13 consecutive 100 yard games. However, on October 10, 2015, Nick Chubb suffered a \"grotesque knee injury\" against Tennessee, preventing him from beating the record. Due to this injury, he missed the rest of the 2015 season but returned for the 2016 season under new head coach Kirby Smart. Chubb returned in the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game, rushing for 222 yards and two touchdowns in a victory over #22 North Carolina. After two modest performances in narrow victories, Chubb sprained his ankle against Ole Miss and was used sparingly over the next five games. Georgia went 1\u20134 in that period, the sole victory coming over South Carolina behind Chubb's 121 yards and two touchdowns (along with Sony Michel's 133 yards). Chubb split carries with Michel for the remaining four games of the regular season, but had 100+ yards in two anyway, and ended 2016 with 142 yards and a game-sealing touchdown over TCU in the Liberty Bowl. He also passed former backfield partner Todd Gurley for second all-time in school rush yards. Chubb also passed Kevin Faulk and Darren McFadden to become second in all-time SEC rushing yards, trailing only fellow bulldog Herschel Walker\u2014who has been voted the greatest college football player of all-time by FBS coaches\u2014in this category. It was thought that Chubb would enter the 2017 NFL Draft, but he decided to return in 2017 for his senior season with the Bulldogs. During his senior campaign, Chubb split carries with Sony Michel, but still managed to amass 1,345 yards on 223 carries (6.0 average) with 15 touchdowns. The two led Georgia to a 12\u20131 record and an SEC title. In a double-overtime victory over Oklahoma in the Rose Bowl in the College Football Playoff semifinal, Chubb had 145 yards on 14 carries, including a 50-yard touchdown just after halftime and a game-tying 2-yard run in the last minute of regulation. (Previously that season, Chubb eclipsed 125 yards and two touchdowns three other times: against Samford, Vanderbilt, and Kentucky.) In the national championship game, Alabama's suffocating defense held Chubb to just 25 yards on 18 carries in the 26\u201323 overtime loss. ===Statistics=== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! rowspan=\"2\"| Team ! rowspan=\"2\"| Games ! colspan=\"5\"| Rushing ! colspan=\"5\"| Receiving |- !
