    "text": "The Barwon Highway is one of the shorter state highways of Queensland, Australia. It starts at the Carnarvon Highway in Nindigully, 44 kilometres south of St George, and travels east for about 155 kilometres until it reaches Goondiwindi, where it terminates at the Leichhardt Highway. The highway travels north of and roughly parallel to the Barwon River, after which it is named. The river forms part of the border between Queensland and New South Wales. This highway is part of State Route 85, which extends for over from Bribie Island to Nindigully, duplexing with the Brisbane Valley Highway (National Route 17) from the D'Aguilar Highway to Esk, the New England Highway (State Route A3) from Hampton to Toowoomba, the Gore Highway (National Route A39 - formerly 85) from Toowoomba to the Leichhardt Highway, and the southern section of the Leichhardt Highway (also National Route A39) to Goondiwindi. ==Stock route== Like many Australian roads, the Barwon Highway follows a declared stock route. The road reserve for most stock routes is wider than for other roads (up to 1600 metres). When seen from the air (or in the Satellite view of Google maps) the substantial width of the western end (from Nindigully to Talwood) can be clearly seen due to the difference in colour between roadside brigalow scrub and adjacent cropland. ==Major intersections== ==See also== * Highways in Australia * List of highways in Queensland * Brigalow Belt * List of highways numbered 85 ==References== Category:Highways in Queensland ",
