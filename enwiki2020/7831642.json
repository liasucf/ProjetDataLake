    "text": "The New Zealand king shag (Leucocarbo carunculatus), also known as the rough- faced shag, king shag or kawau, is a rare bird endemic to New Zealand. Some taxonomic authorities, including the International Ornithologists' Union, place this species in the genus Leucocarbo. Others place it in the genus Phalacrocorax. == Description == Auckland Museum It is a large (76 cm long, 2.5 kg in weight) black and white cormorant with pink feet. White patches on the wings appear as bars when the wings are folded. Yellow-orange swellings (caruncles) are found above the base of the bill. The grey gular pouch is reddish in the breeding season. A blue eye-ring indicates its kinship with the other blue-eyed shags. == Habitat == New Zealand king shags can be seen from the Cook Strait ferries in Queen Charlotte Sound opposite the beginning of the Tory Channel. They live in the coastal waters of the Marlborough Sounds where they are known to breed only on rocky islets at four small sites. == References == == External links == * Image and Classification at Animal Diversity Web New Zealand king shag Category:Endemic birds of New Zealand Category:Vulnerable fauna of Oceania Category:Marlborough Sounds New Zealand king shag New Zealand king shag ",
