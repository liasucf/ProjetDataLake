After the snatch portion of the competition, Ruslan Nurudinov was out of the running for a total (as he did not complete a lift), and Yang Zhe was leading Martirosyan by 1 kg. In the clean & jerk portion of the competition, Martirosyan was the last lifter to begin lifting, and with his first lift of 230 kg he was in first place. After Nurudinov was unable to complete his next lift of 238 kg, Martirosyan attempted and made a 240 kg clean & jerk, setting new world records in the clean & jerk and total, and winning the gold medal. He competed at the 2019 World Weightlifting Championships in the 109 kg category after a convincing win at the 2019 European Weightlifting Championships. He competed against silver medalist in the previous championships (Yang Zhe) and 2008 Olympic Champion (Andrei Aramnau). During the snatch competition Zhe, Aramnau and Martirosyan had their third snatch attempts in succession completed a world record lift each time. Zhe completed a 197 kg snatch, Aramnau with a 198 kg snatch and finally Martirosyan with a 199 kg lift. During the clean & jerk portion Martirosyan was the last lifter to make an attempt and with his lift of 230 kg he secured the gold medal in the clean & jerk and total. ===European Championships=== In 2016 he competed at the 2016 European Weightlifting Championships and won a bronze medal in 105 kg category.
