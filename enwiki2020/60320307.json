The game features a day/night cycle which changes the way factions play. ===Single player=== The game has a campaign or two for every nation. The Anglo-Saxon campaign has the likes of Edward the Confessor, William the Conqueror and Earl of Huntingdon. For the Vikings campaign the game is set in 793 and is divided in two parts. The first part is set during the raid of Lindisfarne's monastery which was the fundamental beginning of Viking Age and serves as a tutorial. Once the tutorial is completed the other campaigns become available. The second part is set in 892 and is dedicated to Rurik, a Varangian chieftain during the Ladoga campaign. The Slavs and Teutons have a campaign each. During the campaigns, the AI is a better player as it is able to replace losses and send large armies to your base. ===Multi player=== The multiplayer aspect of the game provides Domination and Annihilation choices during which a player can have as many as 10 squads. Multiplayer battles can take place on 15 maps prepared for 2, 4 or 6 players (1v1, 2v2 or 3v3). ==Updates== In September 2018, Destructive Creations had added a second Slav campaign where the player can lead Boles\u0142aw I the Brave of Poland and his son Mieszko II.

The second part of the campaign is dedicated to the Commander of the Teutonic Order Konrad von Thierberg and the siege of rebel bastion, the Lidzbark (Lautenburg) Castle. All of the new content is set in the 13th century. In May 2019, Destructive Creations have released a paid DLC titled Ancestors Legacy: Saladin's Conquest. The DLC contains a new nation of Saracens and mainly a brand new campaign, but this time Ancestors Legacy leaves the European soil and tells a completely different story from the perspective of Saladin, the first sultan of Egypt and Syria.

Lennart Bachmann of Big Boss Battle criticized its troop and terrain variety as well as mundane base construction, but recommended the game its expansion overall. ==References== Category:2018 video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Xbox One games Category:Windows games Category:Video games developed in Poland Category:Real- time strategy video games Category:Video games set in the 13th century Category:Video games set in the Viking Age ",
