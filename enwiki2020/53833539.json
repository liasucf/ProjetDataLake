The IVMF annually serves thousands of U.S. veterans, service members, and their families around the world. It was launched in June 2011 to bring together several pre-existing veterans related institutes at the University. J. Michael Haynie is the founder and Executive Director of the IVMF. The institute traces its beginning to The Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans with Disabilities which started within the Martin J. Whitman School of Management in 2006-2007. Under the leadership of Steven Barnes, IVMF grew from four employees in 2006 to more than 70 team members across eight states in 2018. ==Programs== The IVMF has designed a free, comprehensive career training, certification and employment program called Onward to Opportunity in conjunction Veterans Career Transition Program (O2O-VCTP). This program is designed to launch veterans into their next career with more than 30 industry- recognized career tracks and courses. The IVMF provides programs in career, vocational and entrepreneurship education and training, providing service members, veterans and their families with the skills needed to be successful in education, work and life. The IVMF also coordinates comprehensive collective impact strategies; and works with communities and nonprofits to enhance service delivery for veterans and their families. The IVMF joined forces with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Center for Innovation (VACI) in early April 2017 for a national pilot project aimed at demonstrating the merits of a community-based health care and services coordinated referral system within the Institute\u2019s AmericaServes initiative. ==Leadership== J.
