This ranch house next door had a large chapel, fifteen houses for settlers on the farm, the mill and Rural School (for children of settlers on the farm).

Since 1947, Julio Pedroso Lima Junior, son of the owner of Finance sold a few plots of land to Bishop John Matta, in the town now called Santa Luzia that donated a portion of land for construction of a chapel and elsewhere to increase the area of the school grounds. The houses built on the farm were donated to the residents (settlers and squatters). In 1932, the farm is now run by his nephew Americo Lima.
