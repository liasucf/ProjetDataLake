Representing Mexico, she won a gold medal in the javelin at the inaugural 1951 Pan American Games. In 1978, she became the first female player to be elected to the El Paso Softball Hall of Fame, and later served as the organization's president. Garc\u00eda was one of only three women sent by Mexico to compete in the 1951 Pan American Games in Buenos Aires, compared with 64 Mexican men sent that year. In the javelin throw, she finished fifth in the preliminary round and advanced to the finals, where she threw 39.45 metres to take the gold medal, 1.37m ahead of second-place Amelia Bert of the USA. However, her performance was challenged by the Panama athletics delegation, who claimed that only four athletes should have been allowed to advance to the finals. It was the first protest in Pan American Games history. Garc\u00eda was initially disqualified, moving Panamanian athlete Judith Caballero up to the bronze medal position. But on the following day, it was announced that the protest was unsuccessful and overturned. Some records stil do not indicate Garc\u00eda's win, or indicate her preliminary round mark of 32.68m as her final result.I Pan American Game, Buenos Aires 1951 Women, Field.

After the Games, it was revealed that a Chilean runner stole Garc\u00eda's glasses to keep as a souvenir. ==References== Category:1930 births Category:Mexican female javelin throwers Category:Pan American Games medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for Mexico Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1951 Pan American Games Category:American sportspeople of Mexican descent Category:Softball players from Texas Category:Sportspeople from El Paso, Texas Category:2016 deaths ",
