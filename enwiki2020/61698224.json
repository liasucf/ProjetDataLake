    "text": "Trevor Milton (born April 6, 1982) is an American billionaire, and founder and former executive chairman of Nikola Corporation. In September 2020, Milton abruptly resigned from his position after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice began investigating claims that Milton and the Nikola Corporation committed securities fraud. ==Early life and education== Milton was born in Utah to Bill Milton, a Union Pacific Railroad manager, and Sally Milton, a realtor. He has a brother and three sisters. The family moved to Las Vegas when Milton was a toddler, but returned to Utah when he was eight. When he was 15 years old, his mother passed away from cancer. Milton is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and, after high school, went on an 18-month church mission to Brazil, where he became fluent in Portuguese. He dropped out of college after one semester at Utah Valley State College to pursue a career in sales and marketing. ==Career== Milton started an alarm sales company immediately after quitting college called St. George Security and Alarm and eventually exited the business for a stated $300,000, though his former business partner claims he was led to believe the exit payment was \"much smaller.\" Milton then launched an online classified ads website selling used cars, which eventually failed and was then followed by Milton\u2019s first alternative energy vehicles company called dHybrid. Inc that retrofitted commercial trucks with engines that could run on natural gas instead of diesel. dHybrid landed a truck-conversion deal with Swift Transportation, leading to a mid-2012 lawsuit predicated on dHybrid's failure to deliver on its agreement. dHybrid would eventually be purchased by Worthington Industries in 2014 and, in 2015, Milton founded Nikola Motor Company with his brother, Travis, as the director of operations with a background in construction and remodeling. == Fraud allegations == ===Hindenburg Research Report=== In September 2020, two days after Nikola established ties with General Motors, short seller Hindenburg Research released a report accusing Milton of making false statements over the course of many years and characterizing Nikola Motor Company as \"an intricate fraud\". Nikola stock fell by eight percent that day and fell an additional 15 percent the following day, after Milton failed to deliver his rebuttal as he previously promised on Twitter. Further verification by Bloomberg and the Financial Times confirmed some of the details presented in the report. As of September 12, 2020, Nikola Motor Company is facing a shareholder lawsuit by at least one law firm for possible fraud, as detailed in the report from Hindenberg (most of Hindenberg's allegations referred to statements and actions from Milton). === Federal investigations === On September 14, 2020, Bloomberg, the Financial Times, and the Wall Street Journal all reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice had started an investigation related to potential securities fraud committed by Milton and his company. === Resignation === On September 20, Milton abruptly resigned from his position as Executive Chairman of Nikola Corporation, just weeks after tweeting that \"cowards run, leaders stay and fight\". As part of his exit package, Milton remains an unpaid consultant to Nikola until December 2020. He cannot comment about Nikola on social media, online blogs, or any other internet platforms without permission from the company. Milton retains 91.6 million shares of Nikola that are worth roughly about $3.1 billion. Following the Hindenberg Research Report, sexual assault allegations, and stepping down from his position with Nikola, on September 22, 2020, a rumor appeared from a satire account on Twitter claiming \"Trevor Milton, Nikola Corp. founder and former executive chairman, was arrested by the DOJ and FBI at Sky Harbor Airport, in Phoenix, Arizona.\" The tweet was then picked up by Techcrunch, sparking major outlets to report the news. Hours later, it was revealed as a hoax, and Techcrunch publicly apologized. Following the public attention, Milton deactivated his Twitter and Instagram accounts. == Sexual misconduct allegations == In September 2020, Aubrey Ferrin Smith, Milton's cousin, accused him of sexually assaulting her at their grandfather\u2019s funeral in 1999, when she was 15 and he was 18. The Wall Street Journal later confirmed several details of the accusation, including that Smith was, indeed, Milton's cousin and that Smith had told family members about the incident months after it had occurred. Family members also told the Wall Street Journal that religious authorities were notified, but no charges were filed. CNBC later confirmed that Smith had filled a formal complaint with the local police in Holladay, Utah where the alleged assault took place. A Sgt. with the Unified Police Department confirmed that the complaint had been filled. CNBC additionally confirmed that in 2017 when the #MeToo movement was taking place. Ferrin Smith published an account of the assault on Facebook without identifying Milton by name. On September 28th CNBC reported that a second women had come forward claiming that she had been assaulted by Milton when she was 15 and he was 22. The alleged assault which constitutes rape and forced sexual assault under Utah law is being investigated by the local police. Milton reportedly bragged to his friend that he had: \"took her virginity in the theater room.\" Several others confirmed the allegations. ==Personal life== Milton lives in Phoenix, Arizona with his wife, Chelsey Bergmann, who he married in 2018. In November 2019, the Los Angeles Times reported that Milton had bought a 2,000-acre Utah ranch with a 16,800 square foot riverside mansion for $32.5 million. The purchase set a new record for the price paid for a home in the state. In September 2020, Forbes assessed Milton's net worth to be at least $3.2 billion, as he owned about 25% of the company, which was valued at about $12.4 billion. ==References== == External sites == * CNBC Interview: Nikola executive chairman Trevor Milton on the company's public debut * Q&A; podcast with Trevor Milton, focusing on Nikola's financials and technology Category:1980s births Category:Living people Category:American billionaires Category:American company founders Category:American chief executives in the automobile industry Category:People from Phoenix, Arizona ",
