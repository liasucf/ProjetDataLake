    "text": "The 2015 Major League Soccer season featured 20 total clubs (17 based in the United States, 3 based in Canada). The regular season was held from March 6 through to October 25, whereas the MLS Cup Playoffs began on October 28 and ended with MLS Cup 2015 on December 6. The defending MLS Cup champions were the LA Galaxy, while Seattle Sounders FC were the defending Supporters' Shield winners. It was the first season for expansion teams Orlando City SC and New York City FC, who both joined the Eastern Conference, while both the Houston Dynamo and Sporting Kansas City moved from the Eastern Conference to the Western Conference. Chivas USA folded at the end of the 2014 season. At the end of the regular season, the New York Red Bulls of the Eastern Conference won the Supporters' Shield, while the team on top of the Western Conference was FC Dallas. The Portland Timbers won their first MLS Cup, winning 2\u20131 at Columbus Crew SC. ==Overview== The 2015 season began on Friday, March 6. The opening weekend saw an average attendance of 25,838 \u2014 buoyed by strong attendances in Orlando (62,510), and Seattle (39,782) \u2014 with seven of the weekend's ten matches selling out.\"MLS draws a crowd on opening weekend\", Washington Post, Steven Goff, March 9, 2015. Additionally, MLS saw strong TV ratings on ESPN2 (539,000 viewers), Unimas (341,000 viewers), and Fox Sports 1 (289,000 and 278,500 viewers).\"MLS experiences TV ratings boost for 2015 opening weekend\", SI.com, Richard Deitsch, March 11, 2015. ===Franchise changes=== The 2015 MLS season featured the addition of two expansion teams, New York City FC and Orlando City SC. New York City FC became the second MLS team in the New York metropolitan area (joining the New Jersey-based New York Red Bulls), as well as the first based within New York City itself, as the team played its inaugural season at Yankee Stadium). Orlando was a new market for MLS, which returned to Florida for the first time since folding their Miami and Tampa Bay franchises before the 2002 season. The Lions' ownership previously owned Orlando's team that played in the league then known as USL Pro from 2010\u20132014; that team that relocated to Louisville for the 2015 season of the rebranded United Soccer League. While MLS added two teams, one team closed down. Chivas USA, which had called the Los Angeles area home since 2005 and shared the StubHub Center with the LA Galaxy. Chivas had been owned by Mexican club, C.D. Guadalajara, who sold the club back to MLS in 2014. The league folded Chivas in October 2014, after the conclusion of the regular season, though it announced plans to add a second LA-area club, Los Angeles FC, in 2018.\"MLS announces new strategy for Los Angeles market, 2015 conference realignment,\" from MLSSoccer.com, October 27, 2014 ===Realignment and playoffs=== With the addition and subtraction of the above-mentioned teams, the 2015 season saw a realignment of MLS's Eastern and Western conferences: NYCFC and Orlando City joined the East, while Houston Dynamo and Sporting Kansas City moved from the East to the West. Each team played 34 regular season matches: two or three against conference rivals and once against teams from the opposite conference. The regular season concluded with all teams playing at the same scheduled time, a league first. 12 teams advanced to the MLS Cup Playoffs, up from 10 the previous 3 seasons. The top six teams per conference qualified. The first round per conference had the third-seed hosting the sixth-seed, and the fourth hosting the fifth. In the Conference Semifinals, the top seed played the lowest remaining seed and the second played the next-lowest. ===Television=== The 2015 season saw the launch of a new United States television and media rights deal with English-language ESPN and Fox Sports and Spanish-language Univision Deportes. The deal continues MLS's relationship with ESPN and Univision, while it reestablishes one with Fox Sports, whose Fox Soccer channel carried MLS games until 2011 (NBC Sports carried MLS broadcasts from 2012\u20132014). The deal, formally announced in May 2014, sees regular weekly game broadcasts on ESPN2 (Sunday afternoons) and Fox Sports 1 (Sunday evenings), as well as a regular Friday night match on UniM\u00e1s and/or Univision Deportes Network. The networks will share coverage of the MLS Cup Playoffs, while ESPN and Fox will alternate English language carriage of the MLS All-Star Game and MLS Cup championship match each year. The 2015 MLS all star game will be on Fox Sports, and MLS Cup 2015 will air on ESPN. As part of the deal, the networks also share coverage of the U.S. Soccer men's and women's national teams.\"MLS, U.S. Soccer sign landmark TV and media rights partnerships with ESPN, FOX & Univision Deportes,\" from MLSSoccer.com, December 5, 2014 The league reached a four-year agreement with Sky Sports to televise league matches live in the United Kingdom and Ireland. At least two regular season matches each week, the MLS All-Star Game, and every MLS Cup Playoff match was aired on the Sky family of networks. MLS also reached a four-year agreement with Eurosport to air live matches in many other European countries. == Teams == === Stadiums and locations === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !

MLS streamlined the allocation mechanism in the middle of 2015 season. Effective on May 1, 2015, the allocation ranking is the mechanism used to determine which MLS club has first priority to acquire a player who is in MLS allocation list. MLS allocation list contains select U.S. National Team players and players transferred outside of MLS garnering a transfer fee of at least $500,000. The allocations will be ranked in reverse order of finish for the 2014 season, taking playoff performance into account. Once the club uses its allocation ranking to acquire a player, it drops to the bottom of the list. A ranking can be traded provided that part of the compensation received in return is another club's ranking. At all times each club is assigned one ranking. The rankings reset at the end of each MLS season. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:100%;\" |- ! style=\"background:#c2ddff;\"|Original Ranking ! style=\"background:#c2ddff;\"|Final Ranking ! style=\"background:#c2ddff;\"|Club ! style=\"background:#c2ddff;\"|Date Allocation Used (Rank on that date) ! style=\"background:#c2ddff;\"|Player Signed ! style=\"background:#c2ddff;\"|Previous Club ! style=\"background:#c2ddff;\"|Ref |- ! 20 || 1 | LA Galaxy || || || || |- ! 6 || 2 | Chicago Fire || || || || |- ! 7 || 3 | Houston Dynamo || || || || |- ! 9 || 4 | Philadelphia Union || || || || |- ! 10 || 5 | Portland Timbers || || || || |- ! 11 || 6 | Sporting Kansas City || || || || |- ! 12 || 7 | Vancouver Whitecaps FC || || || || |- ! 13 || 8 | Columbus Crew SC || || || || |- ! 14 || 9 | FC Dallas || || || || |- ! 15 || 10 | Real Salt Lake || || || || |- ! 3 || 11 | Montreal Impact || || || || |- ! 18 || 12 | Seattle Sounders FC || || || || |- ! 19 || 13 | New England Revolution || || || || |- ! 5 || 14 | Colorado Rapids || || || || |- ! 1 || 15 | New York City FC || || Mix Diskerud || Rosenborg || |- ! 8 || 16 | Toronto FC || || Jozy Altidore || Sunderland || |- ! 17 || 17 | New York Red Bulls || (1) || Sacha Kljestan || Anderlecht || |- ! rowspan=2 | 2 ! rowspan=2 | 18 | rowspan=2 | Orlando City SC\u266f | || Brek Shea || Stoke City || |- | || Eric Avila || Santos Laguna || |- ! 16 || 19 | D.C.
