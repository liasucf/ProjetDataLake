Brusco worked with her husband, Eben Brusco, and Bob Spangler, in the production of this album. ==Background== This album was funded through a crowdfunding campaign project on Kickstarter. The album's title came from a tapestry she inherited from her grandmother-in-law that was made by her sister, Marie Kelly, and it's now hung in the couples living room. ==Critical reception== Awarding the album three stars from CCM Magazine, Grace Aspinwall states, \"it is inspiring.\" Tony Cummings, giving the album an eight out of ten review for Cross Rhythms, writes, \"Atmospheric is a word often used by hard-pressed reviewers but no other word better fits this soothing balm of an album.\" Rating the album four stars by Indie Vision Music, Shawn Harvey says, \"we can\u2019t help but be reminded of how soothing and powerful that type of worship can be.\" Christian St. John, writing a four star review at Christian Review Magazine, describes, it is \"an alternative worship album\". ==Track listing== ==References== Category:2014 debut albums Category:Sarah Brusco albums ",
