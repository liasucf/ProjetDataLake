Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=433681 on 2017-04-28 ==Description== The length of the shell attains 5.5 mm. (Original description) The shell of this very rare species is small, abbreviate, sub-rhomboidal, solid and, white. The spire is short, pyramidal, the outline flattened, the apex subacute. It contains 7 flat whorls, the body whorl very large, ventricose, depressed beneath the suture, subangulated on the shoulder and rapidly tapering to the base. The surface is cancellated by small close longitudinal ribs and five transverse raised lines. The aperture is narrow and sub-elliptical, a little more than half the length of the shell. The sinus is semicircular. The peristome is trenchant, stoutly ribbed externally, and the inner margin callous. The columella is slightly concave, smooth, thinly callous. Its most obvious character is its short subrhomboid contour, short body, and its cancellated surface.Garrett, Andrew. \"Descriptions of new species of marine shells inhabiting the South Sea Islands.\" Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (1873): 209-231 ==Distribution== This marine species occurs off Paumotus, Polynesia, and off the Philippines ==References== * Tucker, J.K. 2004 Catalog of recent and fossil turrids (Mollusca: Gastropoda).
