Until it was banned in 1992, one of several themed annual \"spirit days\" was Slave Day. According to a 1999 Salon article written on the school's history, \"students dressed in tattered clothes and chains were \"auctioned\" to other students, whom they were then required to serve for the day.\" Images of this day from the 1987-1988 year book circulated in 2020, drawing shock from students and community members. Reports of racial and ethnic intolerance began as early as 1995, when an American-born Asian-American senior at the school was beaten by a group of teenagers shouting racial slurs and telling him to go back to China. The one assailant who took responsibility was sentenced to 20 hours of community service. In early 1998, a student yelled racial epithets at members of the visiting Tamalpais High School basketball team. In reaction to the slurs and actions committed by the San Marin High student, parents of four of the black students from Tamalpais filed suit against the Novato Unified School District, charging that a \"climate of intolerance\" was allowed at San Marin. The Marin County Athletic League put San Marin on probation for more than a year, citing its \"hostile environment\". }Fiona Morgan, salon.com, \"Pride and prejudice: Is Novato, Calif., a breeding ground for hatred \u2013 or jus t like every other American suburb?,\" 1999-04-29 , accessed March 7, 2007The Economist, \"Hate Crimes Continue to Increase Nationally \u2013 Even in Wealthy Suburbs,\" 1999-02-27, accessed March 7, 2007Dave Allen, Marin Independent Journal, February 7, 2008, \"Parents' behavior prompts code of conduct at San Marin High\", accessed February 11, 2007 In the 1998\u201399 school year, San Marin received widespread media coverage after repeated incidents of hate crimes committed against one of their openly gay students. He was beaten by three youths off campus on September 15, 1998, soon after forming the Gay-Straight Alliance at San Marin. The Novato Police offered a reward, but the attackers were never identified. Some students at the school, which had been stressing tolerance at a series of \"respect days\" that year, spoke out in support of the victim and 1000 students and faculty walked out of San Marin to show support for him and pride in their school. The next day, San Marin's principal was reassigned to a District office. Novato's city manager, Rod Wood, referred to \"a small group of individuals who are fairly socially maladjusted\", who identified themselves as white supremacists and called themselves \"the hicks\". The school's behavior code was modified, outlining a range of punishments for racial/ethnic/sexual slurs including reprimand, parental notification, detention on Saturday afternoon, expulsion and police referral. Misbehavior by the parents of a San Marin basketball player on February 2, 2008, in two games with Tam High teams led to drafting of the first code-of-conduct contracts for parents of athletes at a Marin County school. Following a girls junior varsity game at Tam, the mother of a San Marin player followed two referees, shouting obscene insults; later, at San Marin, two parents of San Marin players confronted Tam's coach after he made a gesture indicating that the home team had choked. Novato police were called and the parents were later asked not to attend the remaining games of the season. The code of conduct put into place by Principal Robert Vieth models the importance of sportsmanship and respect. ==Notable alumni == *Mike Wise (1982) \u2013 NFL and UC Davis defensive end *Richard Day (writer) (1980) - Hollywood writer and producer, best known for Mad About You and Arrested Development *Brad Muster (1983) \u2013 NFL and Stanford University running back *Bud Norris (2003) \u2013 MLB pitcher (Houston Astros, Baltimore Orioles, San Diego Padres, Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers, Los Angeles Angels, St. Louis Cardinals) *Brett Carolan (1989) \u2013 NFL tight end; Marin Athletic Foundation Outstanding Student Athlete *Michael Kearney (1990) \u2013 graduated at age 6 after one year at San Marin; world's youngest college graduate *Mike McCoy (1990) \u2013 NFL Head Coach (San Diego Chargers) and University of Utah quarterback *Bret Bergmark (1992) \u2013 mixed martial artist (\"The Angry Hick\") *Meagan McCray (2005) \u2013 Women's Professional Soccer goalkeeper *Manny Wilkins (2013) - Arizona State Sun Devils football quarterback 2014-2018 *Brent Moore (1981) - linebacker for the Green Bay Packers *Juan Alderete (1981) - Grammy-award winning bassist for The Mars Volta and Marilyn Manson ==References== == External links == * San Marin High School website * Novato Unified School District * Archive of Pony Express 2003\u20132006 Category:High schools in Marin County, California Category:Public high schools in California Category:Novato, California ",
