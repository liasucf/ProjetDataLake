The fortress was famously used by the Nizari Ismailis of the Alamut period, and was the biggest Nizari stronghold in the Quhistan region, according to the Tarikh-i Jahangushay. It was connected to the nearby Ghal'eh Kuh of Hasanabad (also known as Ghal'eh Dokhtar) and to the city of Tun itself via secret tunnels discovered after the 1968 Dasht-e Bayaz and Ferdows earthquakes. The fortress was destroyed and burned in May 1256 after its capture by the invading Mongols under Kitbuqa and K\u00f6ke Ilgei. ==References== Category:Ismaili castles Category:Buildings and structures in South Khorasan Province Category:Ferdows Category:Tourist attractions in Ferdows County Category:Mountains of Iran Category:Ruined castles in Iran ",
