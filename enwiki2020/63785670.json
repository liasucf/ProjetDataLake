In the Europe/Africa Zone there were four different tiers, called groups, in which teams competed against each other to advance to the upper tier. Winners in Group I advanced to the World Group Qualifying Round, along with losing teams from the World Group first round. Teams who lost in the first round competed in the relegation play-offs, with winning teams remaining in Group I, whereas teams who lost their play-offs were relegated to the Europe/Africa Zone Group II in 2000. ==Participating nations== * * * * * * * * * ===Draw=== ==First round== ===Ukraine vs. Belarus=== ==Second round== ===Romania vs. Croatia=== ===Austria vs. Portugal=== ===Finland vs. Israel=== ===South Africa vs. Belarus=== ==Second round relegation play-offs== ===Croatia vs. Portugal=== ===Ukraine vs. Israel=== ==References== ==External links== *Davis Cup official website Category:Davis Cup Europe/Africa Zone Europe/Africa Zone Group I ",
