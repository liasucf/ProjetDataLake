This was the first edition of the sir Vivian Richards trophy.This had restricted official contact with South Africa as a response to the policy of apartheid and South Africa's refusal to select non-white players for their international sporting teams. It formed part of the wider sporting boycott of South Africa during the apartheid era. The South African national team made a short tour of India in 1991. It then played in the 1992 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. The decade saw a number of tours of South Africa by major international teams as well as the continued playing of domestic competitions. ==Domestic cricket== The former Currie Cup was renamed the Castle Cup in 1990 and then the SuperSport Series in 1996. ===Castle Cup 1990-91 to 1995-96=== * 1990-91 Western Province * 1991-92 Eastern Province * 1992-93 Orange Free State * 1993-94 Orange Free State * 1994-95 Natal * 1995-96 Western Province ===SuperSport Series 1996-97 to 1999-2000=== * 1996-97 Natal * 1997-98 Free State * 1998-99 Western Province * 1999-00 Gauteng ===Standard Bank Cup / B&H; Series winners=== * 1990-91 Western Province * 1991-92 Eastern Province * 1992-93 Transvaal * 1993-94 Orange Free State * 1994-95 Orange Free State * 1995-96 Orange Free State * 1996-97 Natal * 1997-98 Gauteng * 1998-99 Griqualand West * 1999-00 Boland == International tours == === 1992\u201393 India === The first major tour of South Africa after the lifting of apartheid was by India. The series was the first official tour of the country for 23 years and the first ever by \"a recognised non-white side\".The Indians in Zimbabwe and South Africa, 1992-93, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1993. Retrieved 2018-04-16. A four\u2013match Test match series was won 1\u20130 by South Africa who also won a seven\u2013match One Day International (ODI) series 5\u20132. Despite cricket that Wisden described as \"humdrum\", the tour was considered a wider social and political success and was dubbed the \"Friendship Tour\". It was the first Test series in which an independent umpire stood in matches, and introduction by the International Cricket Conference to try to reduce the possibility for umpires to be biased in their decisions. Television replays to deal with run out and stumping line decisions were also used for the first time on the tour, an innovation introduced by the United Cricket Board of South Africa. Both innovations have become standard in the years since the tour. === 1993\u201394 Australia === The second major tour of post- apartheid South Africa was by Australia in early 1994.
