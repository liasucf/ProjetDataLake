    "text": "Gravelly Hill station Gravelly Hill is an area of Birmingham, United Kingdom. == Location == Gravelly Hill is approximately 4 miles north-east of Birmingham city centre. To the north-west is Perry Barr and to the north-east are Stockland Green, Erdington and Sutton Coldfield. Aston is to the west and Washwood Heath lies to the south. The housing in the area is mostly Victorian and pre-war with some recent developments of modern apartments. Housing in the area is popular with students (particularly those attending Aston University) given its good transport links to the main campus. ==Spaghetti Junction == The Gravelly Hill Interchange, also known as Spaghetti Junction, provides the intersection between the A38(M) Aston Expressway from the centre of Birmingham to the M6 motorway. The complex junction also supports local roads joining the two motorways. The design of the intersection was also made complex by the presence of two railway lines including a high speed electrified railway and the existence of three canals including a turning basin, and a river. == Industry == There are also a number of industrial units in variable condition. One of them, Gravelly Industrial Park, is one of the city's largest industrial estates. Companies with units in the park include Carlsberg, which distributes to regional accounts and national depots. Gravelly Hill railway station is part of the Cross-City Line. ==Local government== Gravelly Hill is part of the Stockland Green ward of Birmingham City Council. However it was previously a ward in its own right and also formed part of the Erdington Constituency. The previous ward was occasionally won by the Conservatives, with the mother of current Conservative Councillor for Erdington Robert Alden, narrowly losing the seat in 1976 elections. His father was parliamentary candidate in 1975-79 for the area, gaining one of the largest swings in the country in 1979. ==External links== *Information on Stockland Green Ward from Birmingham City Council Category:Areas of Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Erdington ",
