Pe\u2019 ll\u2019aria fresca pare gi\u00e0 na festa... Che bella cosa na jurnata \u2019e sole. Refrain Ma n\u2019atu sole cchi\u00f9 bello, oi ne\u2019,Literally, \"Oh baby (girl)\", but commonly used, as here, by a suitor as a term of endearment when addressing his sweetheart, the term \"ne\u2019\" being a contraction of \"nenna\", and meaning \"baby girl\", or \"young girl\" . The widely circulated rendering of this as \"non c'\u00e8\" in Italian (i.e. \"there is not\" in English) is an error . \u2019o sole mio sta nfronte a te! \u2019o sole, \u2019o sole mio sta nfronte a te, sta nfronte a te! L\u00f9ceno \u2019e llastre d\u2019\u2019a fenesta toia; \u2019na lavannara canta e se ne vanta e pe\u2019 tramente torce, spanne e canta, l\u00f9ceno \u2019e llastre d\u2019\u2019a fenesta toia. Refrain Quanno fa notte e \u2019o sole se ne scenne, me vene quasi \u2019na malincunia; sotto \u2019a fenesta toia restarria quanno fa notte e \u2019o sole se ne scenne. Refrain |style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|What a beautiful thing is a sunny day! The air is serene after a storm, The air is so fresh that it already feels like a celebration. What a beautiful thing is a sunny day! But another sun, even more beauteous, oh my sweetheart, My own sun, shines from your face! This sun, my own sun, Shines from your face; It shines from your face! Your window panes shine; A laundress is singing and boasting about it; And while she's wringing the clothes, hanging them up to dry, and singing, Your window panes shine. When night comes and the sun has gone down, I almost start feeling melancholy; I'd stay below your window When night comes and the sun has gone down. |} == Recordings == \"\u2019O sole mio\" has been performed and covered by many artists, including Enrico Caruso, Rosa Ponselle and her Sister Carmella, Andrea Bocelli, Beniamino Gigli, and Mario Lanza. Sergio Franchi recorded this song on his 1962 RCA Victor Red Seal debut album Romantic Italian Songs. Luciano Pavarotti won the 1980 Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Performance for his rendition of \"\u2019O sole mio\". == Authorship and copyright == For nearly 75 years after its publication, the music of \u2019O sole mio had generally been attributed to Eduardo di Capua alone. According to the traditional account, di Capua had composed it in April 1898 in Odessa, while touring with his father's band.. It has turned out, however, that the melody was an elaboration of one of 23 which di Capua had bought from another musician, Alfredo Mazzucchi, in the preceding year. In November 1972, shortly after her father's death, Mazzucchi's daughter lodged a declaration with Italy\u2019s Office of Literary, Artistic and Scientific Property, which sought to have her father recognised as a co-composer of 18 of di Capua's songs, including \u2019O sole mio. In October 2002, Maria Alvau, a judge in Turin, upheld the declaration, ruling that Mazzucchi had indeed been a legitimate co- composer of the 18 songs, because they included melodies he had composed and then sold to di Capua in June of 1897, with a written authorisation for the latter to make free use of them.A declaration to that effect, signed by Mazzucchi, and dated June 6, 1897, was tendered as evidence in the case . At the time of the decision, therefore, the melody of \u2019O sole mio had not yet\u2014as had been widely supposed\u2014entered into the public domain in any country that was a party to the Berne Convention during the relevant period. In most countries where copyright in a work lasts for 70 years after any of its authors' deaths, the melody will remain under copyright until 2042. == English versions == In 1915, Charles W. Harrison recorded the first English translation of \"\u2019O sole mio\". In 1921, William E. Booth-Clibborn wrote lyrics for a hymn using the music, entitled \"Down from His Glory.\" In 1949 U.S. singer Tony Martin recorded \"There's No Tomorrow\" with lyrics by Al Hoffman, Leo Corday, and Leon Carr, which used the melody of \"\u2019O sole mio\". About ten years later, while stationed in West Germany with the U.S. Army, Elvis Presley heard the recording and put to tape a private version of the song. Upon his discharge, he requested that new lyrics be written especially for him, a job that was undertaken by the songwriting duo of Aaron Schroeder and Wally Gold, with a demo by David Hill. The rewritten version was entitled \"It's Now or Never\" and was a worldwide hit for Presley. When performing it in concert in the mid-1970s, Elvis would explain the origin of \"It's Now Or Never\" and have singer Sherrill Nielsen perform a few lines of the original Neapolitan version before commencing with his version. Vic Damone included the song in his album Angela mia (1958). Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album 101 Gang Songs (1961). == In popular culture == * At the opening ceremony of the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, \"\u2019O sole mio\" was played in place of the Italian national anthem, whose score had not been delivered to the band.. * A series of television commercials for Cornetto ice cream, broadcast regularly in Britain during the 1980s, used a jingle (\"Just One Cornetto ...\") set to the melody of \"\u2019O sole mio\". The jingle was widely reported as having been performed by Renato Pagliari, but after Pagliari's death in 2009, his son denied this. * O-Solar-Meow is a 1967 Tom and Jerry space-themed short produced by Chuck Jones and directed by Abe Levitow.
