He lives and works in Wellington, New Zealand. == Biography == Bob Kerr was born in 1951 in Wellington, New Zealand. He grew up in Tokoroa and graduated with a Diploma of Fine Arts (Hons) in 1974 from the University of Auckland. In 1973 he was an editor of Craccum (the Auckland University Students' Association weekly magazine) along with collaborator Stephen Ballantyne, with whom he went on to create Terry and the Gunrunners, which has been adapted for television twice. The first series was released in 1985 and is hosted in full on NZ On Screen. The 2016 series was \"a darker, edgier, more mature reboot of the show\". The comic was re-issued in 2015. He was a judge of the New Zealand Post Children's Book Awards in 2005 and 2012; in 2005 he was the convener of the panel. Many of his stories have appeared in the New Zealand School Journal. He was included in the book A Nest of Singing Birds:100 Years of the New Zealand School Journal. ==Painting== Kerr's paintings are often based on historical events. His work has featured the stories of conscientious objectors, scientists, the New Zealand Wars, the 1916 police invasion of Maungapohatu, a New Zealand soldier's experiences during the Gallipoli campaign, and the Waihi miners' strike of 1912. His best-known work appears on the cover of Michael King's book The Penguin History of New Zealand (2003). ==Select bibliography== * Lucy\u2019s Big Plan, text by Christine Harris (Collins 1977). * Lucy Loops the Loop, text by Oz Kraus (Collins 1979) * Terry and the Gunrunners, text by Stephen Ballantyne (Collins 1982) * Terry and the Yodelling Bull, text by Stephen Ballantyne (Finlayson Hill 1986) * Terry and the Last Moa, text by Stephen Ballantyne (Hodder & Stoughton 1990) * For a Living, co-edited with Linda Mitchell (Working Life Publications 1991) * The Optimist (Mallinson Rendel 1992) * The Day of the Rain, text by Joy Cowley (Mallinson Rendel 1993) * The Day of the Snow, text by Joy Cowley (Mallinson Rendel 1994) * The Paper War (Mallinson Rendel 1994) * Mechanical Harry (Mallinson Rendel 1996) * Strange Tales from the Mall (Mallinson Rendel 1998) * Mechanical Harry and the Flying Bicycle (Mallinson Rendel 1999) * After the War (Mallinson Rendel 2000) * Field punishment No.1., text by David Grant with paintings by Bob Kerr (Steele Roberts, 2008) * Waiheathens.
