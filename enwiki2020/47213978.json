    "text": "Midway briefs (or long-leg boxer briefs) are a hybrid type of men's undergarment which are longer in the leg than boxer briefs and tight-fitting, like all kinds of briefs. == Underwear preference == While some may find boxer briefs uncomfortable, others may find long underwear too lengthy. A pouch or \"oversized\" pouch may be built in to add space and position the testicles forward and give the penis more room. Like boxer briefs, midway briefs are also commonly used in athletics, but are also common for everyday usage. The midway brief design provides form-fitting coverage for the midsection from the waist to the knees and are worn on the waist. They are usually made of a combination of cotton and spandex or a soft, woven flannel material. Midway brief designs can have either a keyhole fly, button (snap) front, pouch, or no fly at all. The waistband is usually a separate band of elastic material, often in a contrasting color to the cotton or flannel material that comprises the rest of the underpants. The elastic band often has the name of the manufacturer printed on it. There may also be additional elastic sewn around the bottom end of the thigh portion of the garment. Like the boxer briefs, some midway briefs have stitching on the rear to outline the buttocks and avoid a central seam. ==References== Category:Undergarments ",
