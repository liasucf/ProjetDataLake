    "text": "Going My Way is a 1944 American musical comedy-drama film directed by Leo McCarey and starring Bing Crosby and Barry Fitzgerald. Based on a story by Leo McCarey, the film is about a new young priest taking over a parish from an established old veteran. Crosby sings five songs in the film,Going My Way with other songs performed onscreen by Metropolitan Opera's star mezzo-soprano, Ris\u00eb Stevens (in the role of a famous Metropolitan Opera performer) as well as the Robert Mitchell Boys Choir (in the role of juvenile delinquents turned into a choir). Going My Way was followed the next year by a sequel, The Bells of St. Mary's. Going My Way was the highest-grossing picture of 1944, and was nominated for ten Academy Awards, winning seven, including Best Picture. Its success helped to make movie exhibitors choose Crosby as the biggest box- office draw of the year, a record he would hold for the remainder of the 1940s. After World War II, Bing Crosby and Leo McCarey presented a copy of the motion picture to Pope Pius XII at the Vatican. ==Plot== Father Charles \u201cChuck\u201d O\u2019Malley, an incoming priest from East St. Louis, is transferred to St. Dominic's Church in New York City. On his first day, his unconventional style gets him into a series of mishaps; his informal appearance and attitude make a poor impression with the elder pastor, Father Fitzgibbon. The very traditional Fitzgibbon is further put off by O\u2019Malley's recreational habits \u2013 particularly his golf-playing \u2013 and his friendship with the even more casual Father Timmy O\u2019Dowd. O'Malley privately informs O'Dowd that he was sent by the bishop to take charge of the affairs of the parish, but that Fitzgibbon is to remain as pastor. To spare Fitzgibbon's feelings, O\u2019Malley acts as if he is simply an assistant. The difference between O\u2019Malley and Fitzgibbon's styles is openly apparent as they deal with events like a parishioner being evicted and a young woman named Carol James having run away from home. The most consequential difference arises in their handling of the youth of the church, many of whom are consistently getting into trouble with the law in a gang led by Tony Scaponi. Fitzgibbon is inclined to look the other way, siding with the boys because of their frequent church attendance. O\u2019Malley seeks to make inroads into the boys\u2019 lives, befriending Scaponi and eventually convincing the boys to become a church choir. The noise of the practicing choir annoys Fitzgibbon, who goes to the bishop and asks for O\u2019Malley to be transferred away. In the course of the conversation, Fitzgibbon infers the bishop's intention to put O\u2019Malley in charge of the parish. To avoid an uncomfortable situation, Fitzgibbon asks the bishop to put O\u2019Malley in charge, and then, resigned to his fate, he informs O\u2019Malley of his new role. A distressed Fitzgibbon runs away, returning late that night. O\u2019Malley puts the older priest to bed, and the two begin to bond. They discuss Fitzgibbon's long-put- off desire to go to Ireland and see his mother, now over 90 years old. O\u2019Malley puts Fitzgibbon to sleep with an Irish lullaby, \u201cToo Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral\u201d. O'Malley runs into Jenny Tuffel, an old girlfriend whom he left to join the priesthood. Jenny now has a successful career with the Metropolitan Opera, performing under the stage name Genevieve Linden. As she prepares to go onstage as the lead in a performance of Carmen, the two discuss their past, and she learns that her world travels with a previous opera company caused her to miss his letter explaining he had entered the priesthood. O'Malley next pays a visit to Carol, who is now suspected of living in sin with Ted Haines Jr., the son of the church's mortgage-holder. O\u2019Malley describes to the young couple his calling in life to \u201cgo his way,\u201d which to him means to follow the joyous side of religion and lead others to do the same. He sings them the song \u201cGoing My Way,\u201d which he wrote on this theme. Jenny visits O\u2019Malley at the church, sees the boys\u2019 choir, and reads the sheet music of \u201cGoing My Way.\u201d She, O'Malley, and O\u2019Dowd devise a plan to rent out the Metropolitan, have the choir perform it with a full orchestra, then sell the rights to the song, saving the church from its financial woes. When the music executive brought on to hear the song does not believe it will sell, the choir decides to make the most of its opportunity on the grand stage, and sings \"Swinging on a Star\". The executive overhears and decides to buy it, providing enough money to pay off the church mortgage. With everything settled, O'Malley is transferred to a new assignment; O\u2019Dowd will be Fitzgibbon's new assistant, with Tony Scaponi in charge of the choir. However, the church is damaged in a massive fire. On Christmas Eve, parishioners gather in a temporary church for a mass that also serves as O'Malley's farewell. As a going-away present, O\u2019Malley has sent for Fitzgibbon's mother from Ireland. As mother and son embrace for the first time in 45 years, the choir sings \u201cToo-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral\u201d, as Father O\u2019Malley quietly slips away into the night. ==Cast== * Bing Crosby as Father Chuck O'Malley * Barry Fitzgerald as Father Fitzgibbon * Frank McHugh as Father Timothy O'Dowd * James Brown as Ted Haines, Jr. * Gene Lockhart as Ted Haines, Sr. * Jean Heather as Carol James/Haines * Porter Hall as Mr. Belknap * Fortunio Bonanova as Tomaso Bozanni * Eily Malyon as Mrs. Carmody * Robert Mitchell Boychoir as St. Dominic's Church Choir * Ris\u00eb Stevens as Genevieve Linden (Jenny Tuffel) * Stanley Clements as Tony Scaponi * William Frawley as Max Dolan * Carl \"Alfalfa\" Switzer as Herman Langer * Adeline De Walt Reynolds as Father Fitzgibbon's mother, Mrs. Molly Fitzgibbon (uncredited) * Anita Sharp-Bolster as Mrs. Quimp * Jack Norton as Music Publisher (Mr. Lilley) * William \"Bill\" Henry as Doctor * Martin Garralaga as Zuniga * Julie Gibson as Taxi driver * Gibson Gowland as Churchgoer Ris\u00eb Stevens, whose character is seen onscreen performing the lead role in a Metropolitan Opera (the Met) production of Carmen, was an actual performer with the Met when the film was made.

But, in this Leo McCarey film,\u2026 he has definitely found his sturdiest role to date.\" Crowther, however, criticized the film's length while lauding Crosby, and wrote that \"he has been stunningly supported by Barry Fitzgerald, who plays one of the warmest characters the screen has ever known. As a matter of fact, it is a cruel slight to suggest that this is Mr. Crosby's show. It is his and Mr. Fitzgerald's together. And they make it one of the rare delights of the year.\" Variety liked the film, saying: \"Bing Crosby gets a tailor-made role in Going My Way, and with major assistance from Barry Fitzgerald and Rise Stevens, clicks solidly to provide top-notch entertainment for wide audience appeal. Picture will hit hefty biz on all booking\u2026 Intimate scenes between Crosby and Fitzgerald dominate throughout, with both providing slick characterizations\u2026 Crosby\u2019s song numbers include three new tunes by Johnny Burke and James Van Heusen \u2014 \u2018Going My Way,\u2019 \u2018Would You Like to Swing on a Star\u2019 and \u2018Day After Forever.\u2019 Trio are topgrade and due for wide pop appeal due to cinch recording and airings by Bing.
