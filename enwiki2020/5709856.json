    "text": "Statehood Day () is a holiday that occurs on every 25 June in Slovenia to commemorate the country's declaration of independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. Although the formal declaration of independence did not come until 26 June 1991, Statehood Day is considered to be 25 June since that was the date on which the initial acts regarding independence were passed and Slovenia became independent. Slovenia's declaration jumpstarted the Ten-Day War with Yugoslavia, which it eventually won. Statehood Day is not to be confused with Slovenia's Independence and Unity Day, which is celebrated each year on 26 December in honour of 26 December 1990 official proclamation of the results of the plebiscite held three days earlier in which 88.5% of all Slovenian voters were in favor of Slovenia becoming a sovereign nation. Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia at the same time, and also celebrates its Statehood Day on 25 June. However, Croatia celebrates Independence Day on a different day, 8 October.http://narodne- novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2002_11_136_2194.html ==See also== * Statehood Day (disambiguation) in other countries * Holidays in Slovenia * History of Slovenia * Breakup of Yugoslavia ==Notes and references== ==External links== *BBC ON THIS DAY | 27 June|1991 \u2013 The BBC marks the date Yugoslavia entered Slovenia following Slovenia's declaration of independence Category:June observances Category:National days Category:Public holidays in Slovenia ",
