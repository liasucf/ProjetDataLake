He also composed music for the film Vaadal which was produced under the banner \"Surel Chitra\" by Lata Mangeshkar. Mangeshkar also sang a thumri for this film. The thumri became very popular and a film talkies in Nagpur reported \"once-more\" requests. The part of the reel with the song was then copied into another reel to enable repeat broadcasts.
