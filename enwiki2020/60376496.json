    "text": "In the sport of cricket, Mankading (named after Indian international Vinoo Mankad) is the informal name given to running out the non-striking batsman whilst he is backing up. The practice is perfectly legal within the Laws of Cricket, but is often seen to be against the spirit of the game. The following are lists of Mankading incidents in major cricket matches. The batsman's team is listed first. ==Instances of Mankading in Test cricket== # Bill Brown by Vinoo Mankad, Australia v India, Sydney, 1947\u20131948India in Australia Test Series \u2013 2nd Test, match scorecard, Cricinfo, Retrieved on 28 February 2009 # Ian Redpath by Charlie Griffith, Australia v West Indies, Adelaide, 1968\u20131969The Frank Worrell Trophy \u2013 4th Test, match scorecard, Cricinfo, Retrieved on 28 February 2009 # Derek Randall by Ewen Chatfield, England v New Zealand, Christchurch, 1977\u20131978England in New Zealand Test Series \u2013 2nd Test, match scorecard, Cricinfo, Retrieved on 28 February 2009 # Sikander Bakht by Alan Hurst, Pakistan v Australia, Perth, 1978\u20131979Pakistan in Australia Test Series \u2013 2nd Test, match scorecard, Cricinfo, Retrieved on 28 February 2009 ==Instances of Mankading in One Day Internationals== #Brian Luckhurst by Greg Chappell, England v Australia, Melbourne, 1974\u20131975England in Australia ODI Match, match scorecard, Cricinfo, Retrieved on 28 February 2009 #Grant Flower by Dipak Patel, Zimbabwe v New Zealand, Harare, 1992\u20131993New Zealand in Zimbabwe ODI Series \u2013 2nd ODI, match scorecard, Cricinfo, Retrieved on 28 February 2009 #Peter Kirsten by Kapil Dev, South Africa v India, Port Elizabeth, 1992\u20131993India in South Africa ODI Series \u2013 2nd ODI, match scorecard, Cricinfo, Retrieved on 28 February 2009 #Jos Buttler by Sachithra Senanayake, England v Sri Lanka, Edgbaston, 2014 ==Instances of Mankading in Twenty20 Internationals== #Mark Chapman by Aamir Kaleem, Hong Kong v Oman, 2016 Asia Cup Qualifier, February 2016 ==Instances of Mankading in first-class cricket== #John Huddleston by John Kinloch, Victoria v New South Wales, Melbourne, 1861-62 #Stoddart Campbell by Nat Thomson, Victoria v New South Wales, Sydney, 1866-67The Oxford Companion to Australian Cricket, Oxford, Melbourne, 1996, pp. 328\u201329. #Tom Reese by Alexander Downes, Canterbury v Otago, Christchurch, 1894-95 #Joe Hardstaff by Khadim Hussain, Lord Tennyson's XI v Sind, Karachi, 1937-38Sind v Lord Tennyson's XI, Lord Tennyson's XI in India 1937/38 \u2013 CricketArchive.
