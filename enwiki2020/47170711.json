The quartet was initially fashioned in one continuous piece. On revising it, probably in 1874, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k began to split the music into the conventional four movements, and set the Andante Appassionato portion aside as a separate item. The last bar of the piece would originally have led into the next section of the complete quartet, and as such, according to Jarmil Burghauser, it would have modulated in key. Instead of this, for the single movement piece, Burghauser provided a suggested F major conclusion with a lengthened tonic note. This is the version recorded by the Prager Streichquartett for the Deutsche Grammophon complete set of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's string quartet works. See CD notes. The piece has been described as \"somewhat reminiscent of Schubertian Romanticism\".English- language version of page about Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's Andante Appassionato for String Quartet B.40a at a Czech site ==Position in the original string quartet== The piece starts in A minor and ends on a chord of F major.Parts for the Quartet No.6 and the Andante Appassionato published together by Barenreiter/Supraphon Urtext edition/ Kriticke Vydani (H6549) in 1983 The start and end keys thus give it a potential place in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's String Quartet number 6 between movements 1 (which ends in A major) & 2 (which starts in F major). Some of the writing of the Andante Appassionato is reminiscent of the start of the second movement of the quartet number 6, which makes the sequence 'Movement 1-Andante Appassionato- Movement 2' credible in the current completed forms of the pieces.Prager SQ DG CD recording of SQ No. 6 (429-198-2) and Andante Appassionato (429-194-2) Note, however, that Burghauser describes it as originally 'leading to the [fourth movement] finale'. == Notes == == References == ==Sources == * * * == External links == * English language version of page about Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's Andante Appassionato for String Quartet B.40a at a Czech site Category:String quartets by Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k Category:1873 compositions Category:Compositions in F major ",
