    "text": "The Illyrian Academy (Academia Illyrika iliti vam Slovinska) was an academy established in Split, Venetian Republic probably in 1703 or 1704. Its mission was to further the causes of the Counter-Reformation movement of the Catholic Church and to advance Slavic letters hoping to spread the use of Slavic (Slovinski) language. The intention of members of this academy was to make their language more attractive and to deal with questions of the writing style. They established the academy in Split because they considered language spoken in Split as the most accomplished Slavic language. They were also concerned about liberation of the Slavic brothers from the Ottoman rule. == Background == The establishment of this academy corresponds with decline of the Ottoman Empire and introduction of the Slavic language into literature published for the Slavic speakers of the Balkans. The Illyrian Academy was one of many similar academies established in Dalmatia in the beginning of the 18th century to further the causes of the Counter-Reformation movement of the Catholic church and to advance Slavic letters hoping to spread the use of Slavic (Slovinski) language. == Establishment == The establishment of the academy was probably initiated by Ivan Pa\u0161tri\u0107. The Illyrian Academy was founded at the very beginning of the 18th century, probably in 1703 or in 1704. John Peter Marchi, a member of the Split nobility, was founder, president and member of the Illyrian Academy. The archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Split-Makarska, Stephanus Cosimi, supported the establishment of the Illyrian Academy. In his 1703 letter he informs Pa\u0161tri\u0107 about the establishment of the academy. Pa\u0161tri\u0107 probably became a member of the Illyrian Academy. The purpose of the Illyrian Academy was to develop science and literature having academies in Italy as role model. The Illyirian Academy published literature works using a language spoken by the people. In 1703 it had 19 members, including Catholic priest Franjo Kriton, Jerolim Kavanjin, Ivan Dra\u017ei\u0107 and Petar Macukat. The Saint protector of the academy was Saint Jerome. == References == == Sources == * * * * * * * * * * * * * == Further reading == * Category:Educational institutions established in the 1700s Category:Venetian Dalmatia Category:1700s establishments in the Republic of Venice Category:Illyrian Academy Category:History of Split, Croatia ",
