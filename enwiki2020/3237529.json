Mason wrote that it \"isn't always an easy listen\" but recommended it to fans of \"sensitive-guy pop\". Brent Hagerman of Exclaim! wrote that Gamble's \"emotional quagmire [makes] for good listening\" without being self-indulgent. Writing in CMJ New Music Monthly, Rob O'Connor called it a \"stunning solo acoustic album\" that shows that he is a \"top-shelf sing-songwriter\" despite his history of supporting roles in the industry. == References == Category:2002 albums ",
