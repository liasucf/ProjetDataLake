North Wagga \"We Shall Not Be Moved\" sign Due to its flood prone nature, Wagga Wagga City Council long sought to deter development in North Wagga and aimed for its residents to relocate. For many years the level of services provided in North Wagga were inferior to the rest of Wagga, and most alterations and additions to dwellings were prohibited.
