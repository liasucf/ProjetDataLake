    "text": "Wu Faxiang (; c. 1578-after 1657) was a printer and publisher in late Ming dynasty China. Wu hailed from Nanjing, and lived near Tianque Mountain. He was a scholar of Confucianism. Wu is known for a single publication, the Luoxuan biangu jianpu, or Wisteria Pavilion Catalogue of Letter Papers, published in 1626. This book contained samples of his studio's decorative writing papers. It was the first publication to make use of the gonghua stamping technique which he invented for embossing images. His better-known contemporary, Hu Zhengyan, made use of this technique in his own Shizhuzhai jianpu (Ten Bamboo Catalogue of Letter Papers). ==References== Category:Ming dynasty people Category:Chinese publishers (people) Category:Businesspeople from Nanjing Category:17th-century Chinese businesspeople Category:Year of birth uncertain ",
