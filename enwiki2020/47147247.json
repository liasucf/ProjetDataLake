Diebold Professor of Linguistics at Yale University, and formerly of Rutgers University, where she served as Department chair from 2005-2008 and Acting Dean of Humanities in the School of Arts and Sciences from 2008-2009. Dayal's research focuses on the interface of semantics and syntax, especially the areas of question forms and relative clauses, bare nominals and genericity, and quantifier words signalling free choice, such as \"any.\" She has examined these forms in data from Hindi as well as English. ==Early life and education== Dayal was born in India. She received a BA, MA, and M. Phil in English Literature from Delhi University. She earned a PhD in Linguistics from Cornell University in 1991, under the supervision of Gennaro Chierchia. == Awards and distinctions == Since 2012 she has been an Associate Editor for the journal Linguistics and Philosophy. She was awarded a Fulbright Senior Research Award for 2004- 2005: \u201cSouth Asian Languages and Semantic Variation: A Cross-Linguistic Study\u201d for research on classifiers in South Asian languages. In 2002-2003, she was awarded a National Science Foundation grant, \u201cQuantification without Quantifiers,\u201d to study the meaning conveyed by nouns without articles in English, Korean, Hebrew, and Hindi. == Selected publications == *2013. \u201cBangla Plural Classifiers,\u201d Language and Linguistics 15.1. *2013. \u201cOn the Existential Force of Bare Plurals Across Languages,\u201d I.
