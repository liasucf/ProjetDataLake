    "text": "Distinctive motif for traffic lights in Hacienda Business Park Hacienda Business Park is a 900-acre (364 hectare) mixed-use job center and housing development in Pleasanton, California. ==History== Approved in 1982 and ratified by Pleasanton voters in 1983, the business park covers approximately 20 square blocks and features many multi-story office buildings and headquarters for mid-sized companies. It was envisioned by local and county planners as a location for office space that would be less expensive than that of Silicon Valley or San Francisco, close to housing in Pleasanton and nearby Dublin as well as the homes of existing employees in the San Francisco Bay Area. In 2010, the city settled a lawsuit to allow for more affordable housing development in the area. ==Location== It is located adjacent to the Dublin/Pleasanton BART station. San Joaquin Regional Transit District (SJRTD) provides commuter subscription service from the Central Valley on several lines in addition to local service provided by WHEELS and County Connection. ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Buildings and structures in Alameda County, California Category:Business parks of the United States Category:Pleasanton, California Category:Amador Valley ",
