The college was founded in 1982 following a separation from the pre-university section of Raffles Institution. Raffles Junior College was merged as the college section of Raffles Institution on 1 January 2009.\"Raffles JC, RI looking into merger\", Sandra Davie, The Straits Times, 4 January 2008 To date, the former junior college and the current Raffles Institution (Year 5-6) has produced 94 President's Scholars and the bulk of Public Service Commission scholars. RJC was recognised as one of the top feeder schools for the Ivy League universities. Alt URL ==History== Raffles Junior college chemistry lab students in the early 1990s. === Founding years === In 1982, Raffles Institution's pre-university section was transferred from Grange Road to a temporary campus at Paterson Road. There, Raffles Junior College was established to offer the GCE A Level curriculum. It was the first junior college to be established with both JC1 and JC2 students, with the JC2 students having just completed their first in pre-university year in the pre-university section of RI. Raffles Junior College moved into a purpose built campus on 53 Mount Sinai Road in 1984 which provided better facilities and a larger site to cater to junior college education. === Introduction of the Raffles Programme === In 2004, the integrated programme between Raffles Institution, Raffles Girls' School, and Raffles Junior College, branded the Raffles Programme was rolled out. On the same year, RJC was relocated to its new Bishan campus at 1 Raffles Institution Lane, adjacent to Raffles Institution. The two schools ran an open campus, allowing students to share facilities between the two institutions. This laid the foundation for the development of the Raffles Programme. A moving ceremony was held on 29 December 2004. On 1 January 2005, the college became an independent institution. In the same year, RJC became the first junior college to be awarded the School Excellence Award, the highest award in the MOE Masterplan of Awards. The new campus was officially declared open by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 8 April 2006, in conjunction with the college's 25th anniversary celebrations. === Reintegration with Raffles Institution === On 1 January 2009, Raffles Junior College re-merged into Raffles Institution to facilitate running of the Integrated Programme. The college section (Year 5\u20136) kept the name as Raffles Institution (Junior College) until 2010, after which it was officially renamed as Raffles Institution. This administrative merger allowed the new institution to function as a single educational organisation on the foundation of a shared campus. ==Principals== * Rudy Mosbergen (1982\u20131987) * Lee Fong Seng (1988\u20132000) * Winston James Hodge (2001\u20132007) * Lim Lai Cheng (2008\u20132009) * Frederick Yeo () ==Culture and identity== ===College anthem=== Raffles Junior College shared the same anthem, Auspicium Melioris Aevi, with Raffles Institution. The anthem was written by E W Jesudason in 1961, who served as headmaster of Raffles Institution from 1963 to 1966. ===Coat of arms=== Raffles Junior College shared its crest with Raffles Institution, a modified version of the Raffles coat of arms, permission for use of which was granted by his family. This replaces the original erminois portion of the field with gold and the purpure of the gryphon crest with gules. The gryphon on the crest is a stately creature, majestic and strong, symbolising stability and success for the school. The double-headed eagle on the shield signifies the looking back onto the past and onto the future, symbolising the institution's tradition of drawing strength and experience from the past to excel in the future. The motto \"Auspicium Melioris Aevi\", displayed at the base of the shield, is officially translated as \"Hope of a Better Age\". While a mistranslation, this has become the standard version.Refer, for example, to One Man's Vision: Raffles Institution in Focus (1992): \"Hope of a Better Age, the school motto, is the vision perceived by Raffles Institution, a perception every Rafflesian hopes to achieve for the future.\" It is also the motto of the Order of St Michael and St George. ===House system=== RJC had a faculty system in place before May 2005. Under the faculty system, students belonged to one of the five faculties, namely: Arts (red), Commerce (black), Computing and Pure Science (green), Engineering (blue) and Medicine (yellow). To facilitate the Raffles Programme from 2005, students of Raffles Junior College were divided into five Houses, the name of which is an amalgamation of its counterparts in RI and RGS: Bayley-Waddle (yellow); Buckle-Buckley (green) ; Hadley-Hullett (purple/black); Morrison-Richardson (blue); Moor-Tarbet (red). Students from the Raffles Programme remained in the same House for the entire six years, while students enrolled into RJC via the Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE) were assigned to a House upon admission. Houses compete in Inter-House Competitions (IHC) annually. Organised by the Students' Council, the events span across disciplines and challenge participants both physically and mentally. The IHC Remix is generally held earlier in the year and comprises the non-Sports events whilst IHC Sports is held later in the year. This arrangement is retained with the merger of RJC into RI in January 2009. == Affiliation == 200x200px Between 2005 and 2009, Raffles Junior College co-ran the Raffles Programme (Integrated Programme) with Raffles Institution and Raffles Girls' School (RGS). In the programme, boys receive their first four years of secondary education in RI and girls in RGS, before completing their pre- university studies in the co-educational Raffles Junior College. == Campus == The bridge connecting Blocks A and B and the courtyard between the two blocks The most recent campus of the former RJC, currently RI's Year 5\u20136 campus consists of 11 blocks and three fields. Facilities include six lecture theatres, a Performing Arts Centre, the Singapore Pools Indoor Sports Hall and the Shaw Foundation Library. == Curriculum == === Raffles Academy === Started in 2007 in Raffles Institution, prior to the 2009 RI-RJC merger, the Raffles Academy was a talent development programme designed to meet the learning needs of students exceptionally gifted in a particular subject. The programme originally spanned Years 3 and 4 but in 2009 was expanded to Years 5 and 6. The Year 5\u20136 Raffles Academy offers four subjects, Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics, of which students can offer up to two, although Mathematics may be offered only with Physics and Biology with Chemistry. Students in the Raffles Academy attend pull-out lectures and tutorials as well as a weekly enrichment session, although they follow the H2 curriculum. At the end of Year 4, students may apply for the Year 5\u20136 Raffles Academy by submitting a personal statement and portfolio, and sitting for a selection test. Approximately 100 students per batch offer the Raffles Academy. === Raffles Humanities Programme === The Humanities Scholarship Programme is the Arts equivalent of the Raffles Academy for sciences, accepting exceptionally gifted humanities students who take the Arts subjects (including but not limited to Literature, Economics, History, Geography, English Language and Linguistics). Admission into the programme is highly competitive, with a 5% acceptance rate. Students can enter this elite programme either through internal interviews or via the Ministry of Education (MOE) Scholarship route. Students accepted into the programme are placed in separate classes from the mainstream Arts classes and occupy a distinct Humanities building within the school, complete with their own lecture hall and classrooms. Lessons conducted under the programme aim to be more interactive, involving students in discussions to a greater extent so as to promote critical thinking skills. Over the course of the programme, Humanities Programme (HP) students benefit from various enrichment activities including weekly guest speakers and humanities workshops. Apart from that, students also have to opportunity to embark on overseas trips to Asia countries such as Japan and South Korea. ==Achievements== Raffles Institution has produced 94 President's Scholars since Singapore's independence in 1965, a notable record among Singapore schools. ==Notable alumni== ===Politicians=== * Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Trade and Industry, Minister-In-Charge of the Public Service * Darryl David, former television personality and Member of Parliament, Ang Mo Kio GRC * Desmond Lee Ti-Seng, Minister for Social and Family Development * Vikram Nair, Member of Parliament, Sembawang GRC * Ong Ye Kung, Minister for Ministry of Education * Rahayu Mahzam, Member of Parliament, Jurong GRC * Christopher de Souza, Member of Parliament, Holland-Bukit Timah GRC * Tan Chuan-Jin, Speaker of Parliament * Josephine Teo, Minister for Prime Minister's Office * Edwin Tong, Member of Parliament, Marine Parade GRC * Zaqy Mohamad, Member of Parliament, Chua Chu Kang GRC * Dennis Tan, Member of Parliament, Hougang SMC * He Ting Ru, Member of Parliament, Sengkang GRC * Jamus Lim, Member of Parliament, Sengkang GRC * Leong Mun Wai, Non-constituency Member of Parliament * Carrie Tan, Member of Parliament, Nee Soon GRC * Mariam Jaafar, Member of Parliament, Sembawang GRC ===Entertainment and media personalities=== * Kai Wong, Hollywood actor, producer from Humanities Programme, transferred to Victoria Junior College. * Kit Chan, singer * Kaira Gong, singer * Corrinne May, singer-songwriter * Rui En, actress and singer ===Writers=== * Alfian Sa'at, writer, poet and playwright * Alvin Pang, poet, editor and writer ===Academics=== * Boon Thau Loo, Professor of Computer Science and Associate Dean at University of Pennsylvania * Andrew Ng, former chief scientist of Baidu, co-founder of Coursera ===Religious leaders=== * Kong Hee, former City Harvest Church pastor ===Entrepreneurs=== * Anuj Khanna Sohum, Founder, Chairman & CEO of Affle == Gallery == File:Library block.jpg|Former Library Block of RJC, current Block H of RI. == Notes == ==External links== * Old Raffles Junior College website * Raffles Institution alumni website * Raffles Parents' Association website * Old Rafflesians' Association website ==References== Category:Schools in Bishan, Singapore Category:Independent schools in Singapore Category:Junior colleges in Singapore Category:Educational institutions established in 1982 Category:1982 establishments in Singapore ",
