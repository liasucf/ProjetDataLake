There were fourteen founding sisters: Betty Chu, Karin Co, Susan Kim, Nancy Lee, Sherri Leung, Annie Loo, Belinda Ma, Anita Ng, Serene Ngin, Fannie Pon, Josie Sun, Daisy Wu, Jill Yoshimura and Reina Yuan, and they dedicated themselves \"to establishing a sorority which would offer Asian American women the opportunity to participate in the Greek system while also establishing an organization which would last as a strong tradition. \". During the fall of 2002, the National Alumnae Board was established under the guidance of the National Board Alumnae Chair, Sophia Yen, to oversee the expansion and growth of the sorority\u2019s alumnae. The 2002-2003 National Alumnae Board strongly desired a working organization that would provide programs and services to all alumnae. This idea later blossomed into the formation of the National Alumnae Association. With a true grassroots beginning, the National Alumnae Board\u2019s initial activity focused on creating a mentoring program that would drive rich learning and development for both mentees and mentors. The success of the mentorship initiative led to the addition of a scholarship program that would award financial aid to sisters looking to further their education. Over the years, the National Alumnae Board has proudly sponsored many programs to edify our alumnae in helping them pursue their dreams, passions, and legacies. To date, the National Alumnae Association is still holding fast to its purpose: to continue the sisterhood after graduation. As such, it remains the leading avenue for our alumnae to connect with one another and express their timeless affection and everlasting devotion to alpha Kappa Delta Phi. ==Asian Awareness== alpha Kappa Delta Phi promotes Asian Awareness, one of its founding principles, by encouraging its members to be constantly aware of and involved in Asian American issues in their communities.
