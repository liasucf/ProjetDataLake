Initially he was the chancellor of Casimir the Just (1189), but during the rebellion of the magnates against Kazimierz in 1191 he went to the side of Mieszko the Old.Document of Casimir the Just of April 12, 1189. A bishop's nomination was probably a reward from Mieszko for this support. The date of this nomination is unknown (between 1193 and 1196). The only reliable source message about him as the Pozna\u0144 bishop is the entry in the Cracow chapter of the capital, registering his death in 1196. ==See also== * List of saints canonized by Pope Pius XI (Bogumi\u0142 z Dobrowa) ==References== Category:1296 deaths Category:12th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Bishops of Pozna\u0144 ",
