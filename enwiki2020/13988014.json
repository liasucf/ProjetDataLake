    "text": "John Burley Waring (1823 \u2013 1875) was an English architect. ==Life== Waring was born at Lyme Regis, Dorset, on 29 June 1823, and owed his early love for literature to the perusal of the \u2018Penny Magazine.\u2019 From 1836 he was educated at a branch of University College, London, then existing at Bristol, where he was also taught watercolour-drawing by Samuel Jackson. In 1840 he was apprenticed to Henry E. Kendall, architect, London. In 1842, he became a student in the Royal Academy, and in 1843 was awarded a medal at the Society of Arts for designs in architectural adornments. His health being delicate and his income ample, he spent the winter of 1843\u20134 in Italy \u2018to improve himself in art and to become a painter.\u2019 On returning to England he was a draughtsman successively in the offices of Ambrose Poynter, Laing of Birkenhead, Sir Robert Smirke (1846), and David Alfred Mocatta (1847). With Thomas R. Macquoid he went to Italy and Spain in 1847 and studied architecture, measuring and drawing the public buildings. The result was a work entitled \u2018Architectural Art in Italy and Spain,\u2019 published in 1850. For this the only remuneration received by the authors was a moderate payment for lithographing the sixty fine folio plates. Singly he produced \u2018Designs for Civic Architecture,\u2019 formed on a style of his own, possessing merit and a considerable share of beauty. In 1850\u20131 and 1851\u20132 he studied in the atelier of Thomas Couture in Paris, and drew assiduously from the life. He afterwards resided at Burgos, and studied the Miraflores monuments. In conjunction with Sir Matthew Digby Wyatt, he in 1854 wrote four architectural guide-books to the courts of the Crystal Palace at Sydenham. While again in Italy in 1855 he made a further series of drawings, which were purchased for the South Kensington Museum, and published in 1858 as \u2018The Arts connected with Architecture in Central Italy.\u2019 He was appointed superintendent of the works of ornamental art and sculpture in the Manchester Exhibition in 1857, and edited the \u2018Art Treasures of the United Kingdom,\u2019 1858. In the International Exhibition at Kensington in 1862 he was the superintendent of the architectural gallery and of the classes for furniture, earthenware, and glass, goldsmiths' work and jewellery, and objects used in architecture. In connection with this exhibition he published in three volumes \u2018Masterpieces of Industrial Art and Sculpture,\u2019 1862, consisting of three hundred coloured plates, the description of which in English and French he himself wrote. He was chief commissioner of the exhibition of works of art held at Leeds in 1868. During a succeeding tour in Italy he sent a series of notes to the \u2018Architect.\u2019 In February 1871 the American Institute of Architects elected him an honorary member, but he obtained little practice. At the age of twenty Waring was an enthusiastic admirer of Swedenborg's doctrines; later he somewhat changed his opinions, and in his \u2018Record of Thoughts on Religious, Political, Social, and Personal Subjects\u2019 (2 vols. 1873), he advanced an eccentric claim to write under \u2018special divine inspiration\u2019 and the power of making prophecies concerning political events. He died at Hastings on 23 March 1875. ==Works== In addition to the works already mentioned he published: 1. \u2018Poems. By an Architect,\u2019 1858. 2. \u2018Architectural, Sculptural, and Picturesque Studies in Burgos,\u2019 1852. 3. \u2018Masterpieces of Industrial Art and Sculpture at the International Exhibition,\u2019 1863. 4. \u2018Illustrations of Architecture and Ornament,\u2019 1865. 5. \u2018The Universal Church,\u2019 1866. 6. \u2018Broadcast,\u2019 short essays, 1870. 7. \u2018The English Alphabet considered Philosophically,\u2019 1870. 8. \u2018Stone Monuments, Tumuli, and Ornaments of Remote Ages, with Remarks on the Early Architecture of Ireland and Scotland,\u2019 1870. 9. \u2018A Record of my Artistic Life,\u2019 1873. 10. \u2018The State,\u2019 a sequel to \u2018The Universal Church,\u2019 1874. 11. \u2018Ceramic Art in Remote Ages, with Essays on the Symbols of the Circle, the Cross and Circle, showing their Relation to the Primitive Forms of Solar and Nature Worship,\u2019 1874. 12. \u2018Thoughts and Notes for 1874 and 1874\u20135,\u2019 two series, 1874\u20135.

Wyatt's \u2018Observations on Metallic Art,\u2019 1857, and \u2018Art Treasures of the United Kingdom, with Essays,\u2019 1858. ==References== ;Attribution Category:1823 births Category:1875 deaths Category:People from Lyme Regis Category:19th-century English architects Category:People from Dorset ",
