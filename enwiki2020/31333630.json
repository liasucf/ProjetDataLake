It was the eighth NCAA gymnastics national championship and the defending NCAA Team Champion for 1988 was Alabama. The competition took place in Athens, Georgia hosted by the University of Georgia in the Georgia Coliseum. The 1989 Championship was won by host Georgia, their second title, with a record score of 192.650. While Suzanne Yoculan and the Georgia Gym Dogs hosted, the favorite heading into nationals was Tanya Service and the UCLA Bruins with the #1 seed. Juggernaut #2 seed, Utah came in with the addition of 1988 American Olympian, Missy Marlowe. The Defending Champion, Alabama lost their top gymnast, Marie Robbins to an ankle injury before the finals. The end of the competition, UCLA head coach Jerry Tomlinson filed an inquiry over several scores with the judges. After the judges review, UCLA still fell short five one-hundredth of a point. == Team Results == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\" ! scope=col | Position !! scope=col | Team !! scope=col | !! scope=col | !! scope=col | !! scope=col | !! scope=col | Total |- bgcolor=fffcaf ! scope=row | 1 | align=left | Georgia Gym Dogs || 47.950 || 48.300 || 47.900 || 48.500 || 192.650 |- ! scope=row | 2 | align=left | UCLA Bruins || 48.550 || 48.100 || 47.300 || 48.650 || 192.600 |- ! scope=row | 3 | align=left | Alabama Crimson Tide || 48.400 || 48.350 || 47.150 || 48.200 || 192.100 |- ! scope=row | 4 | align=left | Nebraska Cornhuskers || 48.000 || 47.650 || 47.450 || 47.700 || 190.800 |- ! scope=row | 5 | align=left | Utah Red Rocks || 47.500 || 48.100 || 47.200 || 47.400 || 190.200 |- ! scope=row | 6 | align=left | Cal State Fullerton Titans || 47.400 || 47.450 || 47.050 || 47.550 || 189.450 |- ! scope=row | 7 | align=left | Arizona State Sun Devils || 47.350 || 46.750 || 46.800 || 47.000 || 187.900 |- ! scope=row | 7 | align=left | Oregon State Beavers || 47.050 || 46.450 || 47.200 || 47.200 || 187.900 |- ! scope=row | 9 | align=left | Oklahoma Sooners || 46.950 || 48.000 || 45.450 || 46.650 || 187.050 |- ! scope=row | 10 | align=left | Florida Gators || 47.200 || 47.750 || 44.750 || 47.300 || 187.000 |- ! scope=row | 11 | align=left | Arizona Wildcats || 46.800 || 47.000 || 45.850 || 46.850 || 186.500 |- ! scope=row | 12 | align=left | Ohio State Buckeyes || 46.600 || 47.300 || 46.150 || 46.350 || 186.400 |- |} ==External links== * Gym Results Category:NCAA Women's Gymnastics championship NCAA Women's Gymnastics Championship ",
