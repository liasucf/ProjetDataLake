    "text": "Niagara and Destroy All Monsters, Spring 1982 Destroy All Monsters were an American, influential Detroit band existing from 1973 to 1985, with sporadic performances since. Their music touched on elements of punk rock, psychedelic rock, heavy metal and noise rock with a heavy dose of performance art. Their music was described by Lester Bangs as \"anti-rock\". They earned a measure of notoriety due to members of The Stooges and MC5 joining the band, and Sonic Youth singer/guitarist Thurston Moore compiled a three compact disc set of the group's music in 1994. == History == === Early years === Formed in 1973, the first edition of Destroy All Monsters was formed by University of Michigan art students Mike Kelley, Jim Shaw, Niagara (artist), and filmmaker Cary Loren (artist). They performed in the Ann Arbor area from 1973\u20131976, and their only release was a one-hour cassette of their recordings available only through Lightworks magazine. Their early music was influenced by Sun Ra, Velvet Underground, ESP-Disk, monster movies, beat culture and futurism. Their sound was experimental, psychedelic, darkly humorous and droning. On New Year's Eve of 1973, the first Destroy All Monsters concert was held at a comic book convention in Ann Arbor, Michigan. At the time the instruments were a violin, a sax, a vacuum cleaner and a coffee can. They performed a demented version of Black Sabbath's \"Iron Man\" and were asked to leave after ten minutes. The group performed \"guerilla style\", setting up free at parties and playing for food along Ann Arbor's frat row. They used modified instruments, a drum machine, tape loops, toys, cheap keyboards and broken electronic devices. Aside from the comic convention, the group's only formal gig in this era was at the Halloween Ball at the University of Michigan art school in 1976. Kelley and Shaw left the band during the summer of 1976 to attend graduate school at CalArts in Los Angeles, California. Both have gone on to lead successful solo careers in the art world. Their work is held in major collections around the world. === New personnel === Niagara, Ron Asheton and Platehead drummer, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA, Spring of 1982 In 1977, Niagara and Loren recruited guitarist Larry Miller and saxophonist Benjamin (Ben) Miller; both had been in the short-lived Sproton Layer (as drummer and guitarist respectively) with their brother Roger Miller (who later went on to co-found Mission of Burma). They invited Mike (Jett) Powers on bass but he soon left for Harvard University. Not long after, members of two important Detroit-based groups signed on: guitarist Ron Asheton, earlier of The Stooges, and bass guitarist Michael Davis of the MC5. Their presence garnered the group more attention than ever before. Shortly thereafter, Ron asked drummer Rob King to join the band (replacing Roger Miller, who had filled the spot on a temp basis). In 1978, Destroy All Monsters were preparing to release \"Bored\", their first official recording, when the group began to really accelerate. Niagara by then ended her relationship with Loren in favor of a new relationship with Asheton; Loren quickly was fired from the group. Soon after the Miller brothers also left after the DAM's Halloween show at EMU, in 1978. The \"Bored\"/\"You\u2019re Gonna Die\" single earned major attention in the UK music press, and a major 35 gig tour of the U.K. followed[ Destroy All Monsters] by Jason Ackney, from Allmusic; URL accessed March 09, 2007 and the band was able to capitalize on the notoriety. === Later developments and reunion === Niagara and Ron Asheton continued touring and recording with Michael Davis releasing a total of four 7\" singles on the IDBI label. Between 1982 and 1984, Destroy All Monsters toured nationally. Personnel: Rob King on drums, Mike Davis on bass, Ron Asheton on guitar, and Niagara on vocals. DAM made friends with the Ramones and Dead Boys during this period. The three bands would take turns opening for each other in New York, Detroit and Philadelphia shows. DAM became the house band for Second Chance (Ann Arbor) and Bookies (Detroit) during these early Punk times. In May 1983, the band recorded and videotaped a song called \"Make Mine Japanese.\" Released in December 1983, this video can now be seen on-line. The Monsters broke up in 1985. The DAM singles were released by Cherry Red Records on CD. In 1994, Mike Kelley, Cary Loren, Byron Coley and Thurston Moore compiled a three-CD boxed set of DAM music, artwork and extensive liner notes as Destroy All Monsters: 1974\u20131976 on Moore's Ecstatic Peace! label. The original lineup (Kelley, Loren, Niagara and Shaw) reformed for reunion shows in 1995.

A display of DAM artwork was held at the Deep Gallery in Tokyo. DAM began work on the installation and film known as Strange Fr\u00fct: Rock Apochrypha, an investigation of Detroit culture. This exhibition was shown and completed in 2000 at COCA (Center on Contemporary Art) in Seattle, WA., and in 2001 at the DAM Collective: Artists Take On Detroit at the Detroit Institute of Arts.
