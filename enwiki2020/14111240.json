Ford Meter Box cover with star and moon emblems Ford Meter Box oblong cover == History == Ford Meter Box was founded by Edwin Ford in Hartford City, Indiana in 1898. The meter box was invented as a place to install water meters outside of homes that did not have basements. Ford's early experimentation found that meters could be installed in pits to protect them from freezing. They also began manufacturing meter-setting products to put in the meter boxes. They later expanded to other equipment for the water-distribution industry. Ford is still a privately held company, partly owned by the founder's descendants. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Manufacturing companies of the United States Category:Companies based in Indiana Category:Water industry Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1898 Category:1898 establishments in Indiana ",
