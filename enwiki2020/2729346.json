    "text": "Dame Catherine Anne Tizard, (n\u00e9e Maclean; born 4 April 1931) is a New Zealand politician who served as Mayor of Auckland City from 1983 to 1990, and the 16th Governor-General of New Zealand from 1990 to 1996. She was the first woman to hold either office. ==Early life== Catherine Anne Maclean was born in Auckland on 4 April 1933 to Scottish immigrants, Neil and Helen Maclean, and grew up in Waharoa, near Matamata, Waikato. Neil was a factory worker at the local Waharoa dairy factory. She attended Matamata College, and she gained a University Bursary in her final year, 1948. In 1949 Catherine enrolled at Auckland University College in Zoology. ==Family== While at university, Catherine met Bob Tizard, then president of the Auckland University Students Association. On their second date, Bob told Catherine he was \"going into politics. And I'm going to marry you.\" They married in 1951, and Bob unsuccessfully ran for the seat of Remuera later that year at the general election and again at the 1954 general election. He was finally successful at the 1957 election, winning in Tamaki, but was defeated three years later by Rob Muldoon. The couple moved to Avondale and started a family, with Catherine having four children in six years starting at the age of 21 with Anne, followed by Linda, Judith and Nigel. They moved in 1957 to Glendowie, in the Tamaki electorate. Bob ran for and won the Pakuranga seat at the general election in 1963. == Academe == In 1961 Catherine returned to university to complete her degree in zoology. She then taught and worked at Auckland University from 1962 to 1983, during which time she co-authored at least two papers with Patricia Bergquist on sponges, and provided technical assistance as preparator for a third. ==Auckland City Council== Tizard was elected to the Auckland City Council in 1971 and was re-elected in 1974, 1977 and 1980. She was also elected to the Auckland Regional Authority in 1980, at the same time as running for Mayor of Auckland against incumbent Sir Dove-Myer Robinson and councillor Colin Kay. This three-way split gave the election to Kay by a margin of 2,000 votes. She opposed the 1981 Springbok tour, and an attempt to ban Hare Krishna from performing chants on Queen Street. In the short-lived government of Prime Minister Norman Kirk, Bob Tizard was appointed first Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health and later under Prime Minister Bill Rowling, Minister of Finance and Minister of Defence. This put considerable strain on the family as Bob was often away overseas. Tizard and her family moved to Wellington, and she commuted to Auckland for council business. From 1976 to 1985, Tizard starred on the popular TVNZ chat show Beauty and the Beast, along with Selwyn Toogood and Shona McFarlane. She later attributed her success in politics to this show. ==Mayor of Auckland City== Tizard decided to run for Mayor of Auckland City again at the 1983 local elections. She defeated incumbent Colin Kay. She was the first female to serve as Mayor of Auckland. In 1984 there was a major riot in Queen Street. In the 1985 New Year Honours, she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for public and community service. During Tizard's term as mayor, the Aotea Centre next to Aotea Square was developed. She was also the patron of the 99th Police recruit wing in 1985 in which all 75 recruits after graduation were sent to Auckland to serve. She was re-elected in 1986, and once again in 1989 following a major amalgamation of local authorities. In 1990 Auckland hosted the Commonwealth Games, an event Tizard had worked to secure for Auckland. ==Governor-General== Tizard delivering a speech at an official function, 1992 In 1989, Tizard was appointed by Elizabeth II, Queen of New Zealand, as the nation's first female governor-general on the advice of Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer. She took office on 13 December 1990, causing a by-election for the Mayoralty of Auckland. She accepted on the proviso that the Queen be informed before her Royal tour in February 1990, and that the leader of the opposition be informed. Then Deputy Prime Minister Helen Clark and Labour Party President Margaret Wilson pushed for a female governor- general, as the 100th anniversary of Women's suffrage in New Zealand would occur during the governor-general's term in 1993. Tizard had been informed of her impending appointment by her former husband Bob Tizard, who was a member of Cabinet at the time. She later commented that this was the only time Bob breached cabinet confidentiality. Tizard was the third female governor-general in the Commonwealth (after Dame Minita Gordon of Belize in 1981, and Jeanne Sauv\u00e9 in Canada in 1984). In 1993, on the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage, Tizard received the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal. During her tenure in office, Tizard ended the practice of bowing to the governor- general, declaring, \"No New Zealander should have to bow to another\". She also ended the practice of members of staff ceasing to clean whenever she entered the room. While governor-general, a particular piece of legislation did not appeal to Tizard at all. She asked the question of her responsible official and asked the question of herself and finally said (apparently): \"All right, I will sign my assent, but I will do it in black ink!\" A special bottle was obtained and used for the purpose!\" ===Controversies=== Prior to the second referendum on electoral reform in New Zealand in June 1993, Tizard caused some outrage by making an unscripted suggestion in a lecture on the role of the governor-general that under mixed-member proportional representation the governor-general would have to use their reserve powers more often, which would create instability. The 1993 New Zealand general election \u2013 the last under First Past the Post \u2013 nearly resulted in a hung parliament, with the election night result having the two major parties tied. She asked Sir David Beattie to form a committee, along with three retired appeal court judges, to decide whom to appoint as prime minister. However, National won one more seat and was returned to power when Labour's Sir Peter Tapsell agreed to become Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives. In an interview with North & South in 1996, Tizard stated that she could not believe \"...some of the idiocies of the health system\", causing great consternation from the Minister of Health. ==Retirement== On her retirement from office, Sir Geoffrey Palmer, who had nominated Tizard for the office, stated: \"She has been a powerful, yes a presidential public presence. She has been a part of New Zealand's growing up.\" In the 2002 Queen's Birthday and Golden Jubilee Honours, Tizard was appointed as an Additional Member of the Order of New Zealand. In 2004, Tizard stated that she supported a New Zealand republic \"in principle\" and when she was governor-general, had discussed the issue of republicanism with the Queen: \"She is quite sanguine about these things. She has always said it is a decision for New Zealand to make, and 'whatever decision New Zealand makes, of course we would accept it'.\" In December 2004, Tizard became a member of the NZ Flag.com Trust, supporting a referendum on whether the New Zealand flag should be changed. She said, \"Our present flag served a young post-colonial country well, but the time has come to consider a change which more appropriately recognises our changed identity and confidence in ourselves. Let's find out what the country thinks of the idea of a change.\" In 2007, Tizard supported former Mayor of Auckland, Dick Hubbard's campaign for re-election as mayor at the local body elections. On 9 October 2007 Tizard was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 3rd Auckland (Countess of Ranfurly's Own) and Northland Regiment, a largely ceremonial role. Changes to the rules in 2006 granted Tizard the use of the style The Honourable for life, as a consequence of having been governor-general. In 2010 Tizard published her memoirs, entitled Cat Amongst the Pigeons, a reference to her personal arms. In December 2012, Tizard starred in an online video campaign supporting gay marriage, alongside New Zealand singers Anika Moa, Boh Runga and Hollie Smith, as well as Olympian Danyon Loader. ==Arms== ==See also== *List of elected and appointed female heads of state and government ==References== ==Further reading== * * ==External links== *Government House: Official biography |- Category:1931 births Category:Governors-General of New Zealand Category:Living people Category:Mayors of Auckland Category:Members of the Order of New Zealand Category:Companions of the Queen's Service Order Category:Dames Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:Dames Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order Category:Dames of Justice of the Order of St John Category:Double dames Category:LGBT rights activists from New Zealand Category:New Zealand Dames Commander of the Order of the British Empire Category:Women mayors of places in New Zealand Category:Auckland City Councillors Category:Auckland regional councillors Category:People from Matamata Category:New Zealand appointees to the Royal Victorian Order Category:New Zealand appointees to the Order of St Michael and St George Category:New Zealand republicans Category:Female heads of state Category:Recipients of the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal 1993 Catherine ",
