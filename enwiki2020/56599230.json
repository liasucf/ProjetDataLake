    "text": "In 1939 Dodge presented a completely new designed line of pickups and trucks. Formally the T series for 1939, V series for 1940, and the W series from 1941 through 1947, the trucks became mostly known as the Dodge Job-Rated trucks. With streamlined, Art Deco styled front sheetmetal, and introducing the concept of \"Job-Rated\" truck configurations, Dodge tried to offer customers the truck that fit the job they were buying it for. As a result, the 1939 to 1947 Dodge pickup / truck range was offered in a bewilderingly large number of available variants and model codes. Six different payload classes, a wide range of bodies, and more than twenty different wheelbase-lengths were manufactured, and fitted with different sized versions of the Chrysler-sourced inline six-cylinder side-valve engines \u2014 from the half-ton TC pickup on a 116-inch wheelbase to three-ton tractor cabs. Nevertheless, mechanically, the trucks were all very similar, with solid axles front and rear and leaf springs at all four corners. With World War II taking up most of production capacity from 1942 to 1945, the 1939 styling continued largely unchanged through 1947, as engineering and production became the main focus. The Dodge trucks enjoyed some popularity before the war, and the last of them built in 1942, before Dodge turned to mostly military production, had progressed to the W-series model name. When they resumed sales post-war, they continued as the 1946 Dodge W-series.1946 Dodge WC Pickup \u2013 howstuffworks Historic author on Dodge trucks, Don Bunn, noted that the 1939 to 1947 Job-Rated trucks represent a very significant segment in Dodge history. They were the first to be mass-produced in the new, huge (Mound Road) Warren truck plant. The Job-Rated trucks also formed the basis for Dodge's first light-duty military four-wheel drives, the 1940 half-ton Dodge VC series, which in turn further developed into the world's first factory 4WD commercial pickups: the Dodge Power Wagon. And lastly, Dodge was the first of the Big Three U.S. auto manufacturers to offer a diesel powered truck \u2014 all the more exceptional, given that Chrysler engineered and built their heavy-duty diesel engines all in-house. Today, this series is the most popular pickups with Dodge truck collectors. ==General== File:1939 Dodge Pickup with wooden bed. Ram hood ornaments adorned every Dodge car and truck from 1932 to 1954.Avard T. Fairbanks, designer of the Dodge Ram symbol and the Plymouth Flying Lady hood ornaments \u2013 Allpar After Dodge joined forces with Graham Brothers trucks from 1925 onwards, Dodge and Graham trucks, marketed through Dodge's vast dealer network, were offered in various capacities, ranging from a half ton to three tons. In May of 1928 Power Wagon magazine already computed a \"truly impressive\" 1,842 possible configuration combinations, of available models, styles, payload ratings and other options.\"The Graham Legacy: Graham-Paige To 1932\" by M Keller. \u2013 Antique Automobile Club of America (archived) For 1939, Dodge rolled out a striking, modern design, new from the ground up, except for the updated drivetrains \u2013 and, as before, offering an exceptionally large number of available variants. In the later 1930s, streamlined styling had become a virtual requirement for anything from appliances, cars, boats, planes \u2014 even trucks, trains, and architecture. The new, 'Job-Rated' Dodge trucks followed suit, and were completely representative of the Streamline Moderne, Art Deco based style, inspired by aerodynamic design, and characterized by elongated horizontal lines and curving forms, to give the impression of sleekness and modernity. The all new, all-steel cabs featured a front-end design with a barrel-shaped base, and a sharp V-shaped grille; long, sleek, crowned front and rear fenders, with embossed \"speed lines\" on the lower rears of each fender \u2013 and a new sloped, two-piece windshield, that could be opened for increased airflow. The headlamps were still free-standing, but were mounted in bullet-shaped pods. From the half-tons to the three-ton models, the new trucks all featured the same distinctive design \u2013 the heavy-duty models only stood out taller, on larger wheels and tires. The unique styling of the trucks, was only really changed in 1940, when Dodge trucks began using sealed-beam headlamps and were equipped with marker lights mounted on the headlamp housing. For the most part, after 1940, year-to-year appearance changes were very minimal. The grille design was lightly changed again in 1941, and this style continued through 1947, except for the lower chrome strips, which were omitted post war. The Job-Rated trucks had stronger frames than previous Dodge trucks, using steel with a higher tensile strength, and the frame-rails extended further forward past the engine than before, such that the truck's beefy, channel-type bumpers tied the rails together, reinforcing the frame. After World War II, several changes were made to production truck chassis parts, based on reliability experience gained during military service \u2013 for instance stronger differentials and larger axle shafts were used in post-war trucks, and steering boxes were beefed up as well. All in all, Dodge advertised as many as 175 basic chassis models, and seven engine variants, as well as different \"job-rated\" choices of clutches, transmissions, axles, gear ratios, springs, tires and brakes.period Dodge advertisement (archived) In 1941, General Motors introduced new trucks for Chevrolet and GMC, that literally became known as their Art Deco trucks, and advertised them as \"The Right Trucks for all Trades\".Shining Design: 1941-'47 Chevrolet \u2013 Hemmings Both Dodge's job-rated trucks, and GM's Art-Decos are recognized as prime truck examples of the 1930s Streamline Moderne architecture and design style. ===Model name codes=== Introduced as the T-Series for the 1939 model year, the line evolved into the V-series for 1940, and W-series for 1941, but the 'W' was retained until the end of sales in 1947. The bottom of the range TC, and its successors VC and WC, were -ton rated, on a wheelbase. As the second letter in the model code progressed in the alphabet, the payload rating typically also went up, however this was not implemented consistently. Although the TD-15, VD-15 and WD-15 were -ton rated, the TD-20 and -21 and its later VD and WD versions were one- tonners. The -15s and the -20s had a wheelbase, but the 1-ton could also be had with (the TD-/VD-/WD-21). Second letter 'E' models only existed in the form of the 1939 TE versions. TF-, VF-, and WF-models were either 1-ton or -ton,Except for the 1940 -ton rated VF-27 through VF-29 ranging in wheelbase from . Second letter G- and H-models were consistently -ton and 2-ton rated, respectively, ranging in wheelbase from . The -ton rated J-models weren't introduced until the 1946 WJ-55 through WJ-59, ranging from in wheelbase. The K-lettered models were consistently 3-ton rated, but the L-lettered models went against the naming pattern \u2013 they were only 2-ton rated. Both were offered in wheelbases ranging through 1942. From 1946 instead there were 3-ton WK- and WR-models ranging in wheelbase from . ==Drivetrain== Dodge's Job-Rated trucks used flathead sixes, originally developed by Plymouth, throughout the 1939\u20131947 range. In the light half-ton trucks initially a 201.3 cu.in. engine was standard; with 70 Hp in 1939, but uprated to 79 Hp in 1940, and 82.5 Hp by 1941. The three-quarter and one-ton trucks used a 217.8 cu.in. engine from 1939 to 1941, rated at 77 Hp initially, then at 82 Hp, and at 85 Hp in 1941. Starting in 1942 (just before civilian production ended), the 201.3 cu.in. engines were dropped from the range, and the -ton light-duty models received the larger 218 cu.in. six, like the 3/4-ton pickups, going up to (gross) after the war, while the one-ton trucks got a larger 230.2 cu.in. (instead of the 218), with 102 horsepower, until the line-up was replaced in 1947. A three- speed manual was standard issue, while a four-speed with a compound first gear was an option. The 1939\u20131947 TK- and TL- through WK- and WL-models were also available with a diesel engine \u2013 Dodge's own diesel engine \u2013 Dodge and Mack Trucks were the only two American automakers of the period before World War II, to have their own diesel engines. An additional 6-volt auxiliary generator debuted in 1941 on the diesel engines. The unit furnished power for lighting, instruments, and horns. Diesel sales were extremely limited however, counting as many as 75 units sold in 1939, 134 units in 1940, and 195 rigs in 1941. ==Bodies and options== Besides with the \"Express\" pick-up bodywork, the Job- Rated trucks were available in cab/chassis, cowl/chassis, or bare chassis (for third party custom body) versions. At the bottom of the range, Dodge offered the three now common pick-up classes (-ton, -ton and one-ton), as well as a 1-ton pick-up. Dodge's half-ton pickups, on a wheelbase with a 7-foot box, were changed to the 70 HP 201 cu.in. L-head straight-six. The 3/4- and 1-ton models kept the 75 HP 218 cubic inch L-head six, either on a wheelbase with a 7-foot box, or a wheelbase with a 9-foot bed. Dodge's 1-ton pick-up, offered from the Job-Rated trucks launch in 1939 until the 1942 switch to all-wartime production, consisted of the long-wheelbase one-ton model with 9-foot bed, but on bigger wheels and tires. Aside from as pickups, the lightest models in the range, the wheelbase TC/VC/WC half-tons, were also offered as a delivery truck, either with solid steel \"panel\" van body, or open canvas-covered canopy or screenside configuration.1939 Dodge TC half ton Owner Manual Pickup Truck Panel Screenside Canopy Guide \u2013 eBay (archived) After the war, both the 1-ton pickup, and the long one-ton pickup with the nine-foot bed were dropped. Post- war available equipment options included a larger clutch, four-speed transmission, oversize tires, electric driver's wiper, heater, chrome windshield frame, adjustable visor, driver's armrest, dome light, turn signals, \"airfoam\" seat with leather upholstery, and an AM radio. ==Models used by the military== ===Purpose-built four-wheel drive=== 1940 Fargo-badged truck at the Australian Army History Unit museum. After Dodge supplied the U.S. Army with its first four-wheel drive truck in 1934, more modern -tonners were developed, and 1,700 RF-40-X-4(USA) trucks were supplied in 1938, and 292 TF-40-X-4(USA) in 1939.1943 Dodge WC-51 Weapons Carrier, Power & Glory \u2013 FourWheeler.com In 1940, Dodge gained an Army contract to design and build -ton 4\u00d74 military trucks in several styles using many commercial truck parts. Based on the VC-Series, and internally called the T-202 series, the VC-1 through VC-6 came with essentially stock front-end sheetmetal. Similarly, their 116-inch wheelbase and 201-cubic-inch 79-horsepower six-cylinder engine shared much with Dodge's civilian -ton VC. The following year, the T202 was replaced by the T-207 series trucks. Again rated as -tonners, they featured a military-specific hood, grille, and fenders. These trucks were powered by the 218-cubic-inch six of 85 horsepower taken from Dodge's - and one-ton commercial models.1946-1948 Dodge Power Wagon \u2013 HowStuffWorks Eventually, the military trucks were substantially redesigned, and uprated to -tons with a 230-cubic-inch engine with 92 Hp. Together with the 1941 -tons, these were built from 1942 until the end of the war as the Dodge WC series military trucks. Some 30 were modified as armored trucks by the French in Syria prior to WWII and known as the Automitrailleuse Dodge 'Tanake.'Surviving French Armoured Vehicles \"These trucks served with Foreign Legion units before the war, and both Vichy and Free French units during WW2. After the war, the trucks remaining in the country passed on to the Syrian government, and some were used during the 1948 war.\"Ibid. The Tanake was fitted with a 37mm cannon M1916 and 2 or 3 FM 24/29 light machine guns and a crew of 5.Automitrailleuse Dodge, Wheeled Fighting Vehicle Data Sheets \u00a9 David R. Haugh, 2002 [http://www.warwheels.net/images/AMDodgeTanakeDATASHEET.pdf ===Stock models and specifications=== Dodge T-234 Lend-Lease truck The U.S. military also used some of Dodge's light truck models in mostly stock, two-wheel drive form. Technical manuals of U.S. Army military vehicles offer some more detailed specifications on three such models: the 1947 model year WC and WD-15 models, and the 160 inch wheelbase version of the SNL G-number 618 aka the WF-32. Additionally there were 4x2, civilian based variants built either as Canadian \"Modified Conventional Pattern\" or \"Canadian Military Pattern trucks\", called the D15 (15cwt, or \u00be-ton \u2013 engineering code T-222), and the D60S and D60L (60cwt, or 3-ton, engineering code T-110, with a short 136\" or long 160\" wheelbase). The Canadian models were built with a engine with a 25\" block, that was unique to them, and they had beefed up rear axles. Chrysler Corporation of Canada produced a total of 180,816 military Dodge trucks during 1939-1945. ====Dodge T-234 \"China / Burma\" truck==== A special case in between stock commercial and dedicated military trucks, was the T-234 \"China / Burma Road\" truck, which was built as part of the Allied cooperation with China against Japan, in the war and just thereafter. From October 1944 through March 1946, Dodge built 15,000 trucks, that used a special order combination of their most heavy-duty off-the-shelf components, to overland supplies from India to China over the very rough Stilwell / Ledo Road, to an extent to specifications personally drawn up by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, then commander of the Nationalist Chinese forces. Chiang Kai-shek asked Roosevelt himself for 15,000 two-and-a-half-ton trucks capable of handling the Burma Road, requiring them to have an engine of at least 300 cubic inches and a 5-speed transmission. The trucks were built with a near standard civilian closed cab \u2013 right-hand drive because the British were in command of Burma \u2013 but fitted with a flat, military-style grille & brush guard, and wide open, almost flat fenders, to avoid mud build-up clogging the wheels rotating, and otherwise stood out by having a 60-gallon fuel tank. In order for the trucks to function on the gruelling 4,700 mile journey over the Himalayas, Dodge fitted not only heavy- duty springs and steering gear, but went sofar as to fit tri-metal aircraft grade bearings and aeroplane-type shock absorbers. Radiators were fitted with an overflow tank, to return the cooled water to the sealed cooling system. Ground clearance was , with a 50\u00b0 approach angle, and 28.5\u00b0 departure.Specification sheet (archived) Front axles were widened to give wider tread. Nevertheless, the average life of the trucks was only about five trips. It has been commented that the front sheet metal design of the T-234 Burma Dodge shows remarkable resemblance to that of the post-war Dodge Power Wagons, and may well have influenced it.
