The film was produced in 1995 by Skyline Productions in association with the BBC Film Fund and subsequently released in 1996 and distributed by Path\u00e9 \u2013 a division of 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. The film received a BBFC Certificate of 15 (intended for audiences aged 15 and over) within the United Kingdom. Some argued that because of the high levels of violence and adult themes portrayed in this film, an 18 certificate would have been more suitable. The film was shot on location at various districts in Glasgow, including Darnley, Sighthill, Partick, Merrylee, Mount Florida and Bishopbriggs and in Edinburgh.(2014) \"Edinburgh the film set\", Film Edinburgh, p. 9 Scenes were also shot at the Glasgow School of Art. The piece won the title of 'Best British Film' at the Edinburgh Film Festival. The song \"In The Year 2525\" by Zager and Evans is used as music over the closing credits. ==Plot== Three teenage brothers \u2013 gang member Bobby, artistically-minded Alan and 13-year-old Lex \u2013 are growing up with their mother on Glasgow's South Side in 1968.
