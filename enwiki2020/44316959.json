It started in April and ended in November 2003. ==Team changes from 2002 season== Three top teams of last season (Darida Minsk Raion, Naftan Novopolotsk and Lokomotiv Minsk) were promoted to Belarusian Premier League. Due to the expansion of Premier League from 14 to 16 clubs, the promoted teams were replaced by only one team that finished at the bottom of 2002 Belarusian Premier League table (Lokomotiv-96 Vitebsk). One team that finished at the bottom of 2002 season table (Osipovichi) relegated to the Second League. They were replaced by three best teams of 2002 Second League (MTZ-RIPO Minsk, Pinsk-900 and Vertikal Kalinkovichi). Lokomotiv-96 Vitebsk shortened their name to Lokomotiv Vitebsk before the start of the season. ==Teams and locations== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left\" !width=120|Team !width=110|Location !data-sort-type=\"number\"|Position in 2002 |- |Lokomotiv |Vitebsk |Premier League, 14 |- |Vedrich-97 |Rechitsa |4 |- |Granit |Mikashevichi |5 |- |Lida |Lida |6 |- |ZLiN |Gomel |7 |- |Kommunalnik |Slonim |8 |- |Dinamo-Juni |Minsk |9 |- |Torpedo-Kadino |Mogilev |10 |- |Neman |Mosty |11 |- |Dnepr-DUSSh-1 |Rogachev |12 |- |Khimik |Svetlogorsk |13 |- |Smorgon |Smorgon |14 |- |Bereza |Bereza |15 |- |MTZ-RIPO |Minsk |Second League, 1 |- |Pinsk-900 |Pinsk |Second League, 2 |- |Vertikal |Kalinkovichi |Second League, 3 |} ==League table== ==Top goalscorers== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\" !Rank !width=170|Goalscorer !width=170|Team !Goals |- !align=\"center\"|1 | Oleg Kuzmenok |MTZ-RIPO Minsk |align=\"center\"|25 |- !align=\"center\"|2 | Aleksandr Savelyev |ZLiN Gomel |align=\"center\"|20 |- !align=\"center\"|3 | Dmytro Kolodin |Lokomotiv Vitebsk |align=\"center\"|17 |- !align=\"center\"|4 | Sergey Ulezlo |Khimik Svetlogorsk |align=\"center\"|15 |- !align=\"center\"|5 | Mihail Eramchuk |Vedrich-97 Rechitsa |align=\"center\"|13 |} ==See also== *2003 Belarusian Premier League *2002\u201303 Belarusian Cup *2003\u201304 Belarusian Cup ==External links== *RSSSF Category:Belarusian First League seasons 2 Belarus Belarus ",
