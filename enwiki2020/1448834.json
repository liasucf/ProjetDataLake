    "text": "Johann Klaj (Latinized Clajus) (161616 February 1656) is a German poet. He was born at Meissen in Saxony. After studying theology at Wittenberg he went to Nuremberg as a \"candidate for holy orders,\" and there, in conjunction with Georg Philipp Harsd\u00f6rffer, founded in 1644 the literary society known as the Pegnitz order. This references Julius Tittmann, Die N\u00fcrnberger Dichterschule (G\u00f6ttingen, 1847). In 1647 he received an appointment as master in the Sebaldus school in Nuremberg, and in 1650 became preacher at Kitzingen, where he died in 1656. Klaj's poems consist of dramas, written in stilted language and redundant with adventures, among which are H\u00f6llen- und Himmelfahrt Christi (Nuremberg, 1644), and Herodes, der Kinderm\u00f6rder (Nuremberg, 1645), and a poem, written jointly with Harsd\u00f6rffer, Pegnesische Sch\u00e4fergedicht (1644), which gives in allegorical form the story of his settlement in Nuremberg. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1616 births Category:1656 deaths Category:People from Meissen Category:17th-century German poets Category:People from the Electorate of Saxony Category:German male poets Category:German-language poets Category:17th-century male writers Category:17th-century German writers ",
