WLEZ originally went on the air at 103.7 FM in 2008 but later that year moved to 100.1 FM. In 2013 the station moved to its final position at 98.1. In August 2019 station ownership shut down the station, citing \"programming, financial, staffing and other operational issues\" in a filing with the Federal Communications Commission. They subsequently relinquished the station's license in December 2019. ==Programming== The station's music format included adult standards, jazz, beautiful music instrumentals, and easy listening during the day and oldies/classic hits overnight. The station also produced and broadcast diverse local programming ranging from talk shows to performances by regional artists. In 2009, WLEZ began carrying New York Giants football in a commercial-free agreement with the Giants' main network. The Giants broadcasts included every pre-season and regular season game during the 2009\u201310 season, though only for terrestrial listeners. In addition, the station broadcast football games of the Brandon High School \"Bulldogs\" over the air and on its internet feed from 2010 - 2019. ==External links== * WLEZ Website * Category:Adult standards radio stations in the United States Category:Oldies radio stations in the United States Category:Community radio stations in the United States LEZ-LP LEZ-LP ",
