    "text": "The Big Picture is the twenty-fifth studio album by British singer-songwriter Elton John, released in 1997. It includes four worldwide singles: \"Live Like Horses\" (a duet with Luciano Pavarotti only for the single version). Profits for this single were donated to Bosnia Warchild Charity. The accompanying video was shot in Austria and was directed by Frederico Brugia with Nick Verden producing for Stark Naked Films. \"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\" (released as a double A-side with \"Candle in the Wind 1997\"), \"Recover Your Soul\" and \"If the River Can Bend\". ==Background== The album has a strong orchestral emphasis with string arrangements written by Anne Dudley and John's then backup keyboardist Guy Babylon. In 2006, John revealed in an interview that Bernie Taupin, his longtime friend and lyricist, considers this his least favourite album they have created, while John believes that to be Leather Jackets from 1986. Taupin dislikes this album because of the overall quality of his lyrical contribution and because \"the production is abysmally cold and technical\". The album was dedicated to John's friend, popular fashion designer Gianni Versace, who was murdered a few months before the album's release. This was John's last album to date to be produced by Chris Thomas, who had worked with John almost nonstop since 1981's The Fox. This is the only album in which neither Davey Johnstone nor bassist Bob Birch (during his tenure as John's bassist from 1992-2012) provide backing vocals. Drummer Charlie Morgan was let go from the band shortly after the album's release and soon replaced by Curt Bisquera and John's old drummer Nigel Olsson, who remains in the lineup to this day. ==Track listing== All songs written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin. ==B-sides== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !

The single version of the song, released in 1996, was a duet with Luciano Pavarotti, but the song is performed solo for this album. The version with Pavarotti was later included on the bonus disc edition of John's compilation Greatest Hits 1970\u20132002. \"Past Imperfect\" and an alternate version of \"Recover Your Soul\" were completed by John for inclusion on The Big Picture. Both songs have yet to see official release.Rocket Man: Elton John From A-Z, 1996 () ==Personnel== *Elton John \u2013 piano, organ, vocals *Guy Babylon \u2013 keyboards *Bob Birch \u2013 bass guitar *Paul Carrack \u2013 organ on \"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\" *Davey Johnstone \u2013 guitars *John Jorgenson \u2013 guitars *Charlie Morgan \u2013 drums, percussion *Matthew Vaughan \u2013 keyboards and percussion on \"I Can't Steer My Heart Clear of You\" *Paul Clarvis \u2013 tabla on \"Recover Your Soul\" *Carol Kenyon \u2013 backing vocals on \"Long Way from Happiness\", \"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\" and \"Recover Your Soul\" *Jackie Rowe \u2013 backing vocals on \"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\" and \"Recover Your Soul\" *Angel Voices Choir \u2013 choir on \"Live Like Horses\" *East London Gospel Choir \u2013 choir on \"If the River Can Bend\" ===Production=== *Produced by Chris Thomas *Orchestral arrangements by Guy Babylon and Anne Dudley *Recorded at The Townhouse, London, UK; Air Lyndhurst, London, UK *Engineered by Pete Lewis *Assistant Engineers \u2013 Andy Green and Jay Reynolds *Management \u2013 John Reid *Painting and Photography \u2013 Julian Schnabel *Portrait \u2013 Mario Testino ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1997) !Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |European Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|1 |- |- |- |- |Hungarian Albums (Mahasz) |align=\"center\"|13 |- |- |Japanese Albums (Oricon) |align=\"center\"|19 |- |Malaysian Albums (Billboard) |align=\"center\"|10 |- |- |- |- |- |- |UK Albums (OCC) |align=\"center\"|3 |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Chart (1997) !Position |- |align=\"left\"|Australian Albums Chart |61 |- |align=\"left\"|Austrian Albums Chart |30 |- |align=\"left\"|Danish Albums ChartTOP20.dk \u00a9 1997 |12 |- |align=\"left\"|Swiss Albums Chart |45 |- |align=\"left\"|UK Albums Chart |37 |} ==Certifications== ==References== Category:Elton John albums Category:1997 albums Category:Albums produced by Chris Thomas (record producer) Category:The Rocket Record Company albums ",
