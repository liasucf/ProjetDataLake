The Republic of U\u017eice ( / ) was a short-lived liberated Yugoslav territory and the first liberated territory in World War II Europe, organized as a military mini-state that existed in the autumn of 1941 in occupied Yugoslavia, more specifically the western part of the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia. The Republic was established by the Partisan resistance movement and its administrative center was in the town of U\u017eice. == Borders == The Republic of U\u017eice comprised a large portion of western part of the occupied territory and had a population of more than 300,000 (according to another source, nearly one million). It was located between the Valjevo\u2013Bajina Ba\u0161ta line in the north, the river Drina on the west, the river Zapadna Morava in the east, and the Ra\u0161ka region to the south. Different sources provide differing information about the size of the republic: according to some sources, it included 15,000 or 20,000 square kilometres. == History == The government was made of \"people's councils\" (odbori), and the Communists opened schools and published a newspaper, Borba (meaning \"Struggle\"). They even managed to run a postal system and around 145 km of railway and operated an ammunition factory from the vaults beneath the bank in U\u017eice.Misha Glenny, The Balkans, 1999, p. 487 In November 1941, in the First anti-Partisan offensive, the German troops occupied this territory again, while the majority of Partisan forces escaped towards Bosnia, Sand\u017eak and Montenegro, re-grouping at Fo\u010da in Bosnia. == End == The leftist policy then pursued by Josip Broz Tito (known later as the leftist errors) substantially contributed to the defeat of the partisans in the Republic of U\u017eice. Because of the pro-fascist Serbian propaganda which described the partisans as being led by foreigners, the population of Serbia turned against the uprising and against the communist insurgents. At the beginning of December 1941 the communists moved from Serbia to Bosnia (nominally part of the NDH) and joined their comrades who had already left Montenegro. == In popular culture == The 1974 Yugoslav partisan feature film The Republic of U\u017eice covers the events surrounding the existence of the Republic of U\u017eice. == See also == *Republic of Biha\u0107 *Former countries in Europe after 1815 == References == ;Notes ;Footnotes ;Bibliography * * * == Further reading == *Venceslav Gli\u0161i\u0107, U\u017ei\u010dka republika, Belgrade, 1986. *Jovan Radovanovi\u0107, 67 dana U\u017ei\u010dke republike (67 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0423\u0436\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0435), Belgrade, 1972.
