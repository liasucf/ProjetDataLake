Custer was the director of intelligence at U.S. Central Command, he grew angry at how little helpful information came out of the NCTC. In 2007, he visited its director at the time, retired Vice Adm. John Scott Redd, to tell him so. \"I told him that after 4\u00bd years, this organization had never produced one shred of information that helped me prosecute three wars!\" he said loudly, leaning over the table during an interview. :Two years later, Custer ... still gets red-faced recalling that day, which reminds him of his frustration with Washington's bureaucracy. \"Who has the mission of reducing redundancy and ensuring everybody doesn't gravitate to the lowest-hanging fruit?\" he said. \"Who orchestrates what is produced so that everybody doesn't produce the same thing?\"\"A hidden world, growing beyond control\", p. 10, by Dana Priest and William Arkin, Washington Post, 7/19/2010 1:22 PM ET.
