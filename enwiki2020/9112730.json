The main enforcer in building the hall, was a woman called Mrs Jessie Hughes, who was the wife of the Rector of Tarporley. At the time she was the president of the Women's Institute and played a pivotal role in raising money for the town hall to be built. She opened the hall by laying a corner stone and declared the stone well and truly laid. In 1928 Mrs Hughes died, but today her hard work is still remembered through an inscribed stone which reads \"This stone was laid by Jessie L Hughes 1926\" The original village hall fell into disrepair and was rebuilt in 2008. The replacement building retained the name Jessie Hughes Village Hall following a local ballot, and was joint winner of the Cheshire Pride Community Project Award in 2008 \u2013 see http://www.silvatimber.co.uk/case-study-jessie-hughes-village-hall ==See also== *Listed buildings in Rushton, Cheshire ==References== ==External links== Category:Villages in Cheshire Category:Civil parishes in Cheshire ",
