It is traversed by both Highway 401 and the former Highway 2. The west end of the Murray Canal that leads east to the Bay of Quinte is at the east end of the town. The land upon which the present day town of Brighton is situated originally belonged to the Mississauga (Anishinaabe-speaking) peoples.Copy of the treaty made October 31, 1923 between his Majesty the King and the Chippewa Indians of Christian Island, Georgina Island and Rama Reprinted 1967. \u00a9Roger Duhamel, F.R.S.C..

However, in recent years, many of the original orchards in the area have been partially removed, to make way for the steadily growing population, and more profitable agricultural produce, such as wheat, corn and soybeans. In late September, Brighton is host to Applefest, its largest yearly festival. The Municipality of Brighton (formed on January 1, 2001, through an amalgamation of the former Town of Brighton and Brighton Township) is home to over 11,000 inhabitants, with a higher than average percentage of those retired. This is common, as the quiet, clean and friendly atmosphere of many smaller towns near Lake Ontario tend to draw the elderly as popular places for retirement living. Presqu'ile Provincial Park, just south of the town centre, is one of Brighton's most popular attractions. The park is noted for bird-watching and other nature-oriented activities. Memory Junction Railway Museum, located in a former Grand Trunk station, has a collection of rail equipment and memorabilia. ==Communities== Besides the town proper of Brighton, the municipality of Brighton comprises a number of villages and hamlets, including the following communities such as Carman, Codrington, Hilton, Spring Valley, Smithfield (partially); Butler Creek, Cankerville, Cedar Creek, Gosport, Orland, Presqui'le Point, Wade Corners. ==History== The village of Brighton was incorporated on January 1, 1859. On December 1, 1980, it became a town. The original Simpson house, at 61 Simpson Street, was built in 1850. ==The artificial island area of Brighton== Part of the current Municipality of Brighton is on a separate artificial island. This is a consequence of the borders chosen when the Township of Brighton was created in 1851, and the excavation of the Murray Canal across the historic Isthmus of Murray. The Murray Canal opened in 1889. ==Demographics== Prior to amalgamation (2001): * Population in 1996: 9,022 ** Brighton (town): 4,584 ** Brighton (township): 4,438 * Population in 1991: ** Brighton (town): 4,366 ** Brighton (township): 4,115 Mother tongue: * English as first language: 92.2% * French as first language: 2.0% * English and French as first language: 0% * Other as first language: 5.8% == Notable residents == * Eddie Hayward, racehorse trainer who won the Kentucky Derby *Mark Kellogg, Associated Press correspondent killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn *Gail Vaz-Oxlade, financial writer and television personality.
