Cheney, Catholic-Hierarchy.org, Grasse (Diocese), retrieved: 2017-06-12. It was originally suffragan to the Archbishop of Aix, and then to the Archbishop of Embrun.Gallia christiana III, p. 1145. The bishopric moved from Antibes to Grasse in 1244. It remained at Grasse Cathedral until the French Revolution. It was suppressed by the Concordat of 1801, its territory passing to the diocese of Nice. ==History== The city of Antibes was a colony of the Greek city of Massilia (Marseille). The Romans included it in the Alpes Maritimae. In church organization, Antibes belonged to the Province of Alpes Maritimae, whose Metropolitan was the Archbishop of Aix.Gallia christiana I (Paris 1716), Notitia provinciarum (unpaginated prefatory matter). Its Metropolitan later, before 1056, became the Archbishop of Embrun.Gallia christiana III, Instrumenta p. 179. The first known Bishop of Antibes is Armentarius who attended the Council of Vaison in 442. Louis DuchesneDuchesne (1907), Fastes \u00e9piscopaux I, p. 101 n. 2. Duchesne is certain he was not bishop of Aix. considered it possible that the Remigius, who signed at the Council of N\u00eemes in 396C. Munier, Concilia Galliae, A. 314 \u2013 A. 506 (Turnholt: Brepols 1963), p. 51. and in 417 received a letter from Pope Zosimus,Nothing in the letter indicates Remigius' diocese. Zosimus was pope only in 417 and 418. may have been Bishop of Antibes before Armentarius.In 1890, is clear that the first known bishop of Antibes was Armentarius. Ralph Matheson, however, believes that this Remigius was Remigius of Aix. On 19 July 1244, Pope Innocent IV transferred the seat of the diocese from the port city of Antibes to the interior city of Grasse, due to a depopulation of Antibes and the repeated attacks of pirates, propter insalubritatem aeris et incursus piratorum.Gallia christiana III, p. 1145. gives a date of 19 July 1243, but the Pope was not at Genoa in 1243; he was at Anagni awaiting his coronation. In 1181, King Idelfonso of Aragon granted Bishop Fulco of Antibes the seigneural rights over the city of Antibes.Tisserant, p. 114. The cathedral of Grasse was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and was supervised by a Chapter composed of (originally) five dignities (Provost, Sacristan, Archdeacon, 'capiscolo' [Scholasticus] and Archpriest) and four Canons (one of whom was designated the Theologus). The office of Provost, however, was abolished on 30 July 1692.Gallia christiana III, p. 1160-1161. Cf. Ritzler-Sefrin, V, p. 211 note 1. In 1752 there were 5 dignities and 10 canons, according to Ritzler- Sefrin, VI, p. 228 note 1. The office of Archdeacon of Grasse was established by Bishop Bernardo de Castronovo on 16 May 1421.Gallia christiana III, p. 1169. The terms of the decree were revised on 4 March 1422. The diocese of Grasse was suppressed by decree of the Legislative Assembly of France on 22 November 1790.S\u00e9n\u00e9quier, p. 46. The arrondissement of Grasse was separated from the diocese of Fr\u00e9jus in 1886, and given to the bishopric of Nice which since unites the three former Dioceses of Nice, Grasse and Vence. ==Bishops of Antibes== *c. 442: ArmentariusArmentarius was present at the Council of Vaison in 442.
