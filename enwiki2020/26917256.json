It approves policy and funding; sets committees and district priorities; and approves employment (including the Superintendent) within the district, among other things. The BOE is made up of seven members. The elected Board of Education members for the 2020-2021 school year are John Foley (President), Cathy Lewis (Vice President), Andrew Chestnut, Nohelani Etienne, Princella Learry, Ann Reilly, and Bernice Rivera. The Clerk of the Board is Martha Morris. The Board of Education typically meets the first and third Wednesdays of each month. Members are elected by district residents that are registered to vote. The election takes place on the third Tuesday in May annually. This is the same day as the budget vote; legally, it is known as the Annual Meeting. Any resident may run for a board seat once they deliver to the Board Clerk a petition containing a minimum number of signatures from district residents and meet specific requirements set forth by the state (namely, residence within the district, the ability to read and write, and a willingness to serve). Board members are not paid for their services to the district. ===Superintendent=== The interim Superintendent of Schools is Dr. Aaron Bochniak, District Director for Planning and Accountability, who was named Interim Superintendent on March 25, 2020, following the resignation of former Superintendent Laurence T.
