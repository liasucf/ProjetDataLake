The 2008 reapportionment transferred one seat from Sirajganj District to Rajshahi District. The new seat took the name Rajshahi-3, bumping up by one the suffix of the former constituency of that name and higher numbered constituencies in the district. == Members of Parliament == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member!!Party |- |style=\"background-color:\" | | 2008 | Shahriar Alam | Awami League |- |} == Elections == === Elections in the 2010s === === Elections in the 2000s === == References == ==External links== * Category:Parliamentary constituencies in Bangladesh Category:Rajshahi District ",
