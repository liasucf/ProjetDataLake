The current version of the program, which is operated by Weill Cornell Medicine, The Rockefeller University, and the Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center's Sloan Kettering Institute, was created in 1991.Paul Smaglik.

In 2019, the program processed over 500 applications for 18 spots. These positions are funded by the National Institutes of Health Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) for the full length of training, which is typically 7\u20138 years.. In recent years, the program has pioneered a summer program known as \"Gateways to the Laboratory\" in order to increase the number of students who are from underrepresented backgrounds in science and medicine. Alumni from this program often matriculate in the Tri-Institutional MD-PhD Program, and make up a significant portion of its class. ==See also== *Weill Medical College of Cornell University *Weill Graduate School of Medical Sciences of Cornell University *Rockefeller University *Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center *Tri-Institutional Training Program in Computational Biology and Medicine ==References== ==External links== *Tri-Institutional MD- PhD Program website *Weill Medical College of Cornell University website *The Rockefeller University *Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Category:Cornell University Category:1991 establishments in New York (state) ",
