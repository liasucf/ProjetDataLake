Readers of all tastes will find something memorable in this collection.\" Kirkus Reviews said, \"Several of Smith's stories are on their ways to becoming classics.\" David L. Ulin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"Smith is at her finest\" in Grand Union and praised the collection's \"balance between humor and self-laceration.\" Writing for Literary Hub, author John Freeman called Smith \"one of our finest short story writers\" and said, \"The compression and swiftness of these tales are opposite skills to the ones Smith has plied in her five, wondrously different novels. Yet to watch these tales unfold is to feel a gladness that only virtuosity\u2014and emotional depth\u2014can ignite.\" Alice O'Keeffe, writing for The Bookseller, said, \"The first ever collection of short stories from the wonderful Zadie Smith is surely a must-read for her many fans.\" Writing for The New York Times Book Review, author Rebecca Makkai wrote, \"While the collection might not coalesce as a unit, it contains some of Smith's most vibrant, original fiction, the kind of writing she'll surely be known for.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 short story collections Category:Short story collections by Zadie Smith Category:Hamish Hamilton books Category:British short story collections ",
