It primarily publishes domestic and international works of literary fiction. ==History== G\u00e9za K\u00e9pes, 1963. Magvet\u0151 was established in 1955 as a publisher of the Magyar \u00cdr\u00f3k Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ge (now the Hungarian Writers' Association). Its main task was to publish contemporary Hungarian fiction and classical Hungarian literature. However, it also published world literature works since it was founded. Upon its founding, a special competitive situation was created within the framework of the state socialist system between Magvet\u0151 and the similar publisher Sz\u00e9pirodalmi K\u00f6nyvkiad\u00f3. It soon became apparent that works which differed from the mainstream of literary policy, which provoked political or aesthetic debates, were more likely to be published by Magvet\u0151. Such works included Endre Fejes's Rozsdatemet\u0151, G\u00e9za Ottlik's Hajnali h\u00e1ztet\u0151k and Ferenc S\u00e1nta's H\u00fasz \u00f3ra. Magvet\u0151 published works by Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1ndy, Mikl\u00f3s M\u00e9sz\u00f6ly, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nagy, \u00c1gnes Nemes Nagy, G\u00e9za Ottlik, Ott\u00f3 Orb\u00e1n, Istv\u00e1n \u00d6rk\u00e9ny, Magda Szab\u00f3 \u00e9s S\u00e1ndor We\u00f6res is. After 1956, the publisher was \"confiscated\" from the association. Previously, the publisher's own shop, the Magvet\u0151 bookstore on Szent Istv\u00e1n Boulevard, also distributed the publisher's works. However, after the 1956 change of regime in Socialist Hungary, it merged into the network of the Libri book distribution company. ===Management=== The founder of Magvet\u0151 was the secretary of the Writers' Association, G\u00e9za K\u00e9pes, a poet and translator. K\u00e9pes served as co-director of Magvet\u0151 with G\u00e9za Heged\u00fcs. J\u00e1nos Pilinszky also worked as a proofreader on the publisher's first volumes. The founding director had to leave Magvet\u0151 in 1957 due to his activities during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, and was replaced by Ferenc Vad\u00e1sz. In 1961, Gy\u00f6rgy Kardos became the head of the Magvet\u0151. Kardos previously served as a Lieutenant Colonel working in military intelligence for the State Protection Authority (\u00c1VH). Kardos is the longest-serving director Magvet\u0151, having served for approximately 25 years. During his tenure as its director, Magvet\u0151 became one of the most successful Hungarian publishing companies of the time. It published the works of many important writers including Berkesi Andr\u00e1s, Istv\u00e1n Csurka, , Gy\u00f6rgy Moldova and Magda Szab\u00f3. However, it also launched the careers of many young writers who did not have the opportunity to publish elsewhere. Kardos was followed by critic Mikl\u00f3s Jov\u00e1novics and editor M\u00e1ria Heged\u0151s, respectively, as director of Magvet\u0151. In 1993, it transformed into a publishing company (kft.-v\u00e9). It was then purchased by L\u00edra \u00e9s Lant Kereskedelmi Rt. (now L\u00edra K\u00f6nyv Zrt.) and has been operating independently within the L\u00edra publishing group ever since. From 1995 to 2015, G\u00e9za Morcs\u00e1nyi was the head of the publisher. Under Morcs\u00e1nyi's leadership, Magvet\u0151 became one of the most prestigious Hungarian fiction publishers, where the works of the most prestigious Hungarian authors of the turn of the millennium were published, including Imre Kert\u00e9sz, the only Hungarian recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.
