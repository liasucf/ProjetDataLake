    "text": "Block Club Chicago is an online newspaper that reports local and neighborhood news in Chicago. The website operates as a non-profit, subscription-based service. After DNAinfo was shut down in November 2017, there was a need for a local news website to fill the void. Block Club Chicago was founded by three former DNAinfo Chicago editors \u2013 Shamus Toomey, Stephanie Lulay, and Jen Sabella. The new online publication was initially funded with a Kickstarter campaign and with capital from the Civil publishing platform. Block Club Chicago went live on June 12, 2018. == References == == External links== * Category:American news websites Category:Newspapers published in Chicago Category:2018 establishments in Illinois ",
