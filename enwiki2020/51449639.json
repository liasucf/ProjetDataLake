    "text": "Albert \"Max\" Abramson (born April 29, 1976) is an American politician currently serving as a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Rockingham District 20 (Hampton Falls, Seabrook) since 2018. He previously represented the same district from 2014 to 2016. He ran for the nomination of the Libertarian Party for the 2020 election, but dropped out on March 3, 2020. He is best known for being the Libertarian nominee for Governor of New Hampshire in 2016. He sought the Veterans Party nomination for President but lost. == Career == In 2010, Abramson was a candidate in the Republican primaries for the New Hampshire House of Representatives, Rockingham District 14, but lost. Following his resignation from the Seabrook Planning Board and Budget Committee, Abramson announced a run for the position of the Rockingham County attorney's office as a Libertarian, remarking that the office was \"overstaffed\" and was not investigating \"violence, sexual misconduct, and theft by police officers\". Abramson was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives, as a Republican, representing Rockingham district 20 in late 2014. In May 2016, Abramson announced that he had changed his party registration from Republican to Libertarian. In September, he was nominated as the Libertarian Party of New Hampshire's candidate for Governor of New Hampshire in the 2016 gubernatorial election, garnering 4.3% of the popular vote. Abramson's campaign, buoyed by Gary Johnson's campaign, won major party status and automatic ballot access for the Libertarian Party of New Hampshire for the first time in 20 years. Following the 2016 election, Abramson switched back to the Republican Party and was re-elected in 2018 to the seat he previously held in the Legislature. === 2020 presidential campaign === Following the 2018 election, Abramson announced his return to the Libertarian Party to campaign for the 2020 Libertarian presidential nomination. Abramson officially announced his campaign for president under the Libertarian banner on June 30, 2019, two days after again leaving the Republican Party, and becoming an independent. During his campaign, Abramson was the only incumbent elected official running for the Libertarian nomination, however, he never actually joined the Libertarian Party. He stated that his primary campaign platform was to bring troops home and cut the national debt. Moreover, the goal of Abramson's campaign was not \"necessarily\" to win the presidency, but to elect as many Libertarians to legislature seats as possible. Abramson quit the Libertarian Primary on March 3, 2020, subsequently ending his bid for the Libertarian presidential nomination. Abramson returned to the Republican Party, but later changed parties again, this time joining the Democratic Party. On June 8, Abramson joined the Veterans Party of America to run for their presidential nomination. He also later announced a run for the nomination of the Reform Party. Abramson attempted to organize a merger between the two parties, which was negatively reacted to by Reform Party leadership. Abramson finished a distant second to Rocky De La Fuente at the Reform Party Convention on June 20.http://ballot- access.org/2020/06/20/reform-party-nominates-rocky-de-la-fuente-for-president- again/ On August 22, Abramson announced on Twitter that The Veteran's Party of America decided not to hold a convention or run a candidate for the 2020 presidential election, effectively ending his 2020 presidential run. He decided to run as a Republican for the New Hampshire House of Representatives from District 37 of Rockingham County. == Legal issues == On December 19, 2010, Abramson was arrested after firing a gun outside his crowded home. Abramson claimed he did this to break up a fight happening inside his home. At the time, Abramson was a member of the Seabrook Planning Board and Budget Committee. In March 2012, he was convicted of felony reckless conduct for the incident. He resigned from the Planning Board on July 17, 2012. == Electoral history == == Notes == == References == == External links == * * Campaign site Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:American government officials convicted of crimes Category:Candidates in the 2020 United States presidential election Category:People from Kent, Washington Category:People from Seabrook, New Hampshire Category:Members of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Category:New Hampshire Libertarians Category:New Hampshire politicians convicted of crimes Category:New Hampshire Republicans Category:New Hampshire Democrats Category:Candidates in the 2016 United States elections Category:21st-century American politicians ",
