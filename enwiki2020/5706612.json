Blithe was portrayed in the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers by Marc Warren. Blithe's life story was featured in the 2010 book A Company of Heroes: Personal Memories about the Real Band of Brothers and the Legacy They Left Us. ==Youth== Blithe was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After completing 3 years of high school, he enlisted for the paratroopers on August 18, 1942, in his hometown. ==Military service== ===World War II=== Blithe trained at Camp Toccoa, Georgia, in August 1942 under Captain Herbert M. Sobel. Blithe jumped with the rest of Easy Company into occupied France as part of the massive Airborne invasion; however, when he landed, he found himself lost. Blithe was joined by a number of other paratroopers who were also part of the mis-drops. They teamed up together and found the rest of Easy Company. As portrayed in Band of Brothers by Marc Warren, Blithe was struck with a temporary case of hysterical blindness following the fierce fight to capture Carentan.Ambrose, p. 98 He recovered and was part of a patrol investigating a farmhouse a few days later, where he was shot in the collar bone by a sniper. He recovered from the woundAmbrose, p. 103 and received a Purple Heart on June 25, 1944. Due to his wound, on October 1, 1944, he was sent home and never returned to the European Theater of Operations. Blithe was released from the Army Hospital October 8, 1945, which has been verified by his discharge paperwork at the end of World War II. He attended the 1st annual reunion of the 101st Airborne Division Association. He returned to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and started a career with Westinghouse Electric. ===Korean War and afterward=== Blithe also served in Korea with the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team after the end of hostilities and later was assigned to the Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan. He never retired from military service. ==Death== On December 10, 1967, while on active duty in Germany, Blithe felt nauseated when he returned from a weekend at Bastogne, Belgium, where he had taken part in the ceremonies commemorating the Battle of the Bulge. On December 11, 1967, Blithe was taken to the emergency room at Wiesbaden Hospital, Germany, where he was admitted with a diagnosis of a perforated ulcer. He died in the intensive care unit on December 17 after surgery, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery with full honors. In the miniseries Band of Brothers, the closing text of the third episode incorrectly states that Blithe died in 1948 due to never fully recovering from his wound (a bullet to the neck). This was an error made by the producers. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * ==External links== * *Blithe in Taiwan from Currahee website *The Battle of Normandy Category:1923 births Category:1967 deaths Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:American army personnel of the Korean War Category:Band of Brothers characters Category:Burials at Arlington National Cemetery Category:Deaths from peritonitis Category:Deaths from kidney failure Category:Operation Overlord people Category:Military personnel from Philadelphia Category:Recipients of the Silver Star Category:United States Army soldiers ",
