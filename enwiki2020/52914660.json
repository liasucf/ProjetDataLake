    "text": "Gaunt Brothers Racing is a Canadian professional stock car racing team that currently competes in the NASCAR Cup Series. Gaunt Brothers Racing formerly competed in the Pinty's Series and the K&N; Pro Series. The team is owned by Marty Gaunt, president of the now-defunct Triad Racing Technologies; GBR originally used engines from Triad before moving to Toyota Racing Development motors in alliance with Joe Gibbs Racing. ==NASCAR Cup Series== ===Car No. 96 history=== The team's No. 96 car at Daytona in 2017 On January 18, 2017, Gaunt Brothers Racing declared their plans to attempt the 2017 Daytona 500 with Canadian driver D. J. Kennington behind the wheel of the No. 96 Toyota Camry. The team was fielded in a partnership with RAB Racing. They plan to attempt all four superspeedway events in 2017. Kennington made the 59th annual Daytona 500, by passing Elliott Sadler at Cam-Am Duel 2. The team failed to finish the race after being involved in a crash just past halfway. The team returned to Talladega where they used ThorSport Racing's No. 98 hauler. The team failed to qualify. They didn't return to Daytona in July because Kennington joined Premium Motorsports, leaving the team without a driver. However, the team, with Kennington, returned to Daytona in an attempt to qualify for a second straight 500 in 2018, guaranteed after only 40 showed up to try to get in the race. The team entered the spring ISM Raceway race, which would be their first appearance on a non-restrictor track, qualifying 34th. Parker Kligerman joined GBR for the Coca-Cola 600, his first Cup race since 2014. Jeffrey Earnhardt joined the team in August 2018 for 14 of the final 16 races. Jesse Little was announced to drive at the August Bristol night race. Earnhardt and GBR parted ways before the Martinsville race. He was replaced by Kennington at Martinsville and Kligerman at Texas. Kligerman returned to the team in an attempt to qualify the Daytona 500 and drove the majority of the races during the 2019 NASCAR season that featured Gaunt Bros. Racing. Drew Herring came on board to drive the season finale at Homestead for the team. On January 17, 2020, Kligerman announced that he has no plans to return to the No. 96 or in any of NASCAR's three national series. On January 28, Daniel Su\u00e1rez officially signed with Gaunt Brothers Racing to race the No. 96 full-time in 2020. Despite Su\u00e1rez's eligibility, the team did not participate in the 2020 Busch Clash to focus on the 2020 Daytona 500. The move came as GBR had a total of three chassis in the shop, some dating back to 2012 as Michael Waltrip Racing originals. Su\u00e1rez failed to make the Daytona 500 after finishing 22nd in Duel 1 of the 2020 Bluegreen Vacations Duels when he collided with Ryan Blaney in turn 4. On September 15, 2020, Gaunt Brothers Racing and Su\u00e1rez announced that they would be parting ways in 2021. ====Car No. 96 results==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:75%\" !
