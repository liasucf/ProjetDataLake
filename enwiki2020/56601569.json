    "text": "ReBecca Hunt-Foster is an American paleontologist. She has worked with dinosaur remains from the Late Jurassic to Late Cretaceous of the Colorado Plateau, Rocky Mountains, Southcentral, and the Southwestern United States of America. She described the dinosaur Arkansaurus fridayi and identified the first juvenile Torosaurus occurrences from Big Bend National Park in North America in 2008. == Career == * Mulberry High School, Mulberry, Arkansas. 1998 * B.S. Earth Sciences, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, Arkansas. 2003 * M.S. Geology, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas. 2005 Hunt-Foster is the park paleontologist for the National Park Service at Dinosaur National Monument, where she has worked since August 2018. Previously she was the district paleontologist for the Bureau of Land Management\u2013Utah, where she has worked from 2013 to 2018. She was employed for five years as paleontology collections manager at the Museums of Western Colorado from 2007 to 2012 and a research assistant at Augustana College from 2005 to 2008. === Professional work === Hunt-Foster's current research includes Early Cretaceous ornithomimosaurs from North America, the Upper Cretaceous Williams Fork Formation paleofauna of western Colorado, the ichnofauna of the lower Jurassic to lower Cretaceous rocks of southeastern Utah. ReBecca has worked as a paleontologist in western Colorado and eastern Utah since 2007. Prior to moving to the area, ReBecca was a research assistant at Augustana College where she worked on latest Cretaceous ceratopsian dinosaurs from southern Laramidia and preparing Cryolophosaurus, the first known dinosaur from Antarctica. She has also worked on Precambrian stromatolites and the geology of Glacier National Park. == Popular books == Hunt-Foster is the coauthor of \"Behavioral interpretations from chasmosaurine ceratopsid bonebeds: a review.\" with Andrew Farke, in the 2010 book New Perspectives on Horned Dinosaurs. == References == == Bibliography== *Hunt-Foster, ReBecca K. 2016.
