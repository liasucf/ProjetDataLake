Born in Paris, he was the son of a famous tragedian, Prosper Jolyot de Cr\u00e9billon. He received a Jesuit education at the elite Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand. Early on he composed various light works, including plays for the Italian Theatre in Paris, and published a short tale called Le Sylphe in 1730. From 1729 to 1739 he participated in a series of dinners called \"Le Caveau\" (named after the cabaret where they were held) with other artists, including Alexis Piron, Charles Coll\u00e9, and Charles Duclos. The publication of Tanza\u00ef et Neadarne, histoire japonaise (1734), which contained thinly veiled attacks on the Papal bull Unigenitus, the cardinal de Rohan and others, landed him briefly in the prison at Vincennes.Carole Dornier, \"Orient romanesque et satire de la religion: Claude Cr\u00e9billon, Tanza\u00ef et N\u00e9adarn\u00e9 et Le Sopha,\" Eighteenth-Century Fiction Vol. 11: Iss. 4, Article 1 (1999) His novel Les \u00c9garements du c\u0153ur et de l'esprit was published between 1736 and 1738 and was, although he continued to edit it in 1738, never finished. Publication of Le Sopha, conte moral, an erotic political satire, in 1742 forced him into exile from Paris for several months. Around 1744 he entered into a romantic liaison with Lady Henrietta Maria Stafford, daughter of a Jacobite chamberlain, and they were married in 1748.Robert L. S. Cowley, Marriage a-la-mode: a re-view of Hogarth's narrative art, Manchester University Press, 1983, , p.105 A son was born in 1746 and died in 1750. Despite financial hardship, they lived together until her death in 1755. Meanwhile, he published La Nuit et le moment (1745), Ah! quel conte! and Les Heureux Orphelins (1754). Inheriting nothing from Henriette, he was forced to sell his large library in 1757 and eventually found steady income as a royal censor (like his father) in 1759. In 1768 and 1772 he published his last two novels, Lettres de la duchesse de *** au duc de *** and Lettres ath\u00e9niennes. ==Works== * Le Sylphe ou Songe de Madame de R***. \u00c9crit par elle- m\u00eame \u00e0 Madame de S*** (1730) (full text in French on Gallica) * Lettres de la marquise de M*** au comte de R*** (1732) * Tanza\u00ef et N\u00e9adarn\u00e9 (incorrectly known as L'\u00c9cumoire, histoire japonaise) (1734) (full text in French on Gallica) * Les \u00c9garements du c\u0153ur et de l'esprit ou M\u00e9moires de M. de Meilcour (1736\u20131738) * Le Sopha, conte moral (1742) (full text in French on Gallica) * Le dialogue des morts (1745) * Les amours de Z\u00e9okinisul, roi des Kofirans (1746) (authorship disputed) * Ah quel conte !
