From positivenation.co.uk \"Diagnosed with HIV in 1993, Mr Pasquarelli disclosed his HIV status to his employers after becoming severely ill with multiple Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, a cancer which affected his lungs and liver. When the store closed for refurbishment last April, he claimed was not offered suitable alternative work, was discriminated against and made redundant. His case was reported in the media in the same week as stars flocked to a celebrity party held by Giorgio Armani to endorse the Bono Red campaign to promote HIV awareness and support the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria. Mr Armani\u2019s partner Sergio Galeotti died from AIDS in 1993. In its ruling against the Armani franchise company Orthet, the tribunal said: \u201cWe would expect Mr Pasquarelli\u2019s many years of loyalty to be rewarded by the offer of at least a temporary position for the duration of the caf\u00e9's closure. \u201cOrthet discriminated against Mr Pasquarelli by not offering him alternative employment and did so for a reason relating to his disability, treating him less favourably than they treated a person to whom that reason did not apply.\u201d Since 5 December 2005, the Disability Discrimination Act has protected all HIV positive employees in work from the point of diagnosis.http://www.positivenation.co.uk/issue127/regulars/news/news127.htm http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Armani+cafe+boss+sacked+for+having+HIV+wins+[pounds+sterling]18,000-a0151671241 ==References== ==External links== *Timeout Singapore Shopping Club 21 Ladies *40 Richest in Singapore 2009 *Singapore Retailers Association eDirectory *DKNY Jeans official site for Asia/Europe/Middle East region *Reference for Business: Mulberry Group PLC *Dolls Club 21 Category:Retail companies of Singapore Category:Singaporean brands ",
