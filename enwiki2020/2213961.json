    "text": "{| |} BRP Gregorio Velasquez (formerly known as R/V Melville and originally built as the USNS Melville (T-AGOR-14)) is a research vessel formerly operated by Scripps Institution of Oceanography for oceanographic research. As the R/V Melville, it was the oldest active vessel in the academic research fleet, collectively known as the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System | University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System: What is UNOLS? (UNOLS).http://scrippsnews.ucsd.edu/Releases/?releaseID=927 | Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Scripps News: Scripps Research Vessel Melville Returns after Two-and-a-Half Year Voyage The US Government confirmed on 17 November 2015 that the Melville will be transferred to the Philippine Navy as Excess Defense Articles (EDA)s. The vessel was officially transferred to the Philippines on 28 April 2016 and was commissioned into active service at the same time with the Philippine Navy.http://www.cpf.navy.mil/news.aspx/110031 ==Construction== The second ship to be so named by the Navy, Melville (AGOR 14) was laid down on 12 July 1967 by the Defoe Shipbuilding Company in Bay City, Michigan, launched on 10 July 1968; sponsored by Marguerite \"Peg\" Kletchka Cederberg, wife of Congressman Elford Cederberg; and was completed and delivered to the Navy on 1 August 1969, when she was placed in service with the Military Sea Transportation Service as USNS Melville (T-AGOR 14) chartered to the Scripps Institute of Oceanography for operation. Though often listed as a Robert D. Conrad-class oceanographic research ship the ship is of an entirely different appearance, design and size as evidenced by Melville'shttp://shipsked.ucsd.edu/Ships/Melville/specs.php | Scripps Ship Operations, R/V Melville: Specifications 2,944 vs. Conrad'shttp://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/r7/robert_d_conrad.htm | Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Vessels, Robert D. Conrad 1,370 loaded displacement, dimensions of 279' X 46' X 16.6' as opposed to Conrad's 208'10\" X 37'5\" X 15'2\", general appearance and layout and, most distinctly, completely different propulsion systems and capabilities. Melville's original system was a cycloidal system with propulsion later modified to an advanced system of twin 1,385 hp diesel electric engines driving 1,385 hp Z-Drive Lips | Azimuth thruster for ships : Z-drive (illustration) with a 900 hp Retractable Azimuthing Thruster allowing the ship to move 360\u00b0 under main engines while Conrad's was single screw 2,500shp diesel-electric with a retractable azmuthing bow thruster.http://www.navsource.org/archives/09/57/5703.htm | NavSource: USNS Robert D. Conrad (T-AGOR-3) ===Sister ship=== Melville's sister ship is the R/V Knorr, best known as the ship which located the wreck of the RMS Titanic in 1985, which was also launched in 1968. ==Designation== Melville was named for George Melville, a pioneer arctic explorer and Rear Admiral in the United States Navy, who was Chief of the Bureau of Steam Engineering from 1887 to 1903. ==Operating personnel== A crew of 23 keeps the ship operational, and up to 38 scientists can be accommodated for the purposes of the scientific expedition. ==Operational history== USNS Melville (T-AGOR-14) underway off Bay City, Michigan, 9 July 1969 During a career now in its fourth decade, Melville has cruised over almost all the World's oceans in the pursuit of scientific knowledge. Modernized in the early 1990s, Melville's hull was lengthened, increasing her displacement to 2670 tons (full-load), and a new propulsion system was installed. ===Role in the 1976 movie King Kong=== The Melville was used in the 1976 movie King Kong, starring Jessica Lange and Jeff Bridges. It was used specifically because of its Hypoid propulsion drive (at that time), which allowed it to move sideways. This type of drive is used, on research vessels, for station keeping in the ocean over drill and coring sites. ===Transfer to the Philippine Navy=== The White House confirmed on 17 November 2015 that the Melville and USCGC Boutwell (WHEC-719) would be transferred to the Philippine Navy as Excess Defense Articles (EDA)s. On 29 April 2016, the ship was formally turned over and commissioned to the Philippine Navy at a ceremony held in San Diego, California. The ship was renamed BRP Gregorio Velasquez, after a Filipino National Scientist, and assigned the pennant number AGR-702. The ship is expected to provide the Philippine Navy with hydrographic survey and maritime research capabilities. ==References== * == External links == * Scripps Institution of Oceanography: R/V Melville Specifications * NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive - T-AGOR-14 Melville * NHHC Online Library of Selected Images: USNS Melville (T-AGOR-14)* http://shipsked.ucsd.edu/Ships/Melville/ * HiSeasNet: Research Vessel Melville Realtime Data * AGOR Numeric List Category:University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research vessels Category:Robert D.
