He studied at the yeshiva of Wilkomir, and received musical training at Vilna. After briefly working as a teacher and peddler, Golomb was hired as a corrector at the Widow and Brothers Romm publishing house in Vilna. While there he translated into Yiddish the Hilkhot De'ot of Maimonides's Mishneh Torah (1876). He also published several pamphlets in Yiddish, among them Mishle \u1e24akhamim. He then published a series of works on music: Kol Yehudah, a musical chrestomathy (1877); Menatzea\u1e25 bi- Neginot, a manual of singing and the violin, partly in Hebrew and partly in Yiddish (1884); and Zimrat Yah, a manual of harmony, in Hebrew and Yiddish, followed by a musical glossary (1885). He also wrote a series of school-books, including \u1e24eder la-Tino\u1e33ot, a Hebrew reader (1883); Lahakat Nevi'im, a graded Hebrew chrestomathy (1888); and \u1e32iryat Sefer, a description of Vilna, Grodno, Byalistok, and Warsaw, and of their Jewish communities. Throughout his life he contributed to the Hebrew periodicals Kol la-Am, Ha-Israeli, Ha-Kol, Ha- Levanon, Ha-Melitz, Ha-Tzefira, and Ha-Yom. Golomb earned his livelihood by teaching violin and writing captions for tombstones. He suffered poverty all his life and died in a Vilna home for the aged in 1934. ==References== Category:1853 births Category:1934 deaths Category:People from Ukmerg\u0117 District Municipality Category:People from Vilkomirsky Uyezd Category:Lithuanian Jews Category:Imperial Russian Jews Category:Hebrew- language writers Category:Russian folk-song collectors Category:Russian musicologists Category:Textbook writers Category:Translators from Hebrew Category:Translators to Yiddish Category:Yiddish-language writers ",
