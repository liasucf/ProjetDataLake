Croatia finished third in the group behind Brazil and Mexico and therefore failed to qualify for the next stage. ===Euro 2016=== At Euro 2016 in France, Srna, once again as team captain, played in Croatia's first group stage match against Turkey. Shortly after the match, however, he returned to Croatia upon the news of his father's death during the match. He returned to France to finish the tournament afterwards, to abide by his father's dying wish. Croatia reached the knock-out phase of the tournament, but lost 1\u20130 to Portugal through an extra-time Ricardo Quaresma goal. He amassed 134 caps and 22 goals, which makes him his country's most capped player. ==Personal life== Srna was born in Metkovi\u0107 to Bosniak father Uzeir (d. 2016) and Croatian mother Milka. His father, a World War II orphan and a former footballer for FK Sarajevo, supported his fledgling football career despite discrimination during the Yugoslav wars and widespread corruption among football coaches. Before leaving Croatia to join for Shakhtar Donetsk, he gave his parents a brand new Mercedes. He has a tattoo of a deer playing football on his leg, as \"Srna\" in Croatian means \"deer\". Srna has also helped Bosnian club Borac \u0160amac, where his father played as goalkeeper and was also a coach.Hrvatski reprezentativac poma\u017ee srpski klub, Borac mu nudi mesto koje po\u017eeli at Sportski \u017eurnal, 7 September 2015 Srna has a half-brother, Renato, a coach at Neretva, from their father's first marriage. His other brother Igor has Down syndrome.

He also has a tattoo reading \"Igor\" along his heart. While at Shakhtar, Srna frequently bought match tickets for orphans and often financed their travel to the stadium at his own expense. In late 2014, he purchased 20 tonnes of tangerines from farms near Metkovi\u0107 and had them donated to over 23,000 primary school children in the Donbass region during the ongoing war there. Srna married long-time girlfriend Mirela Fori\u0107, whom he met through mutual friend and footballer Bo\u0161ko Balaban. Their daughter Kasja was born in July 2010 and their son Karlo was born in June 2015. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club
