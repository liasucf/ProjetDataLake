In the early 1600s there were barely any trees in the area, so timber was imported from Norway. The locals had to store this timber somewhere, so they constructed some houses out of the timber. These houses became known as 'block houses' (Danish: blokhuse), which gave name to the village.Visitjammerbugten.dk \"Bes\u00f8g det historiske Blokhus\" Retrieved 17 October 2020 Axel P.
