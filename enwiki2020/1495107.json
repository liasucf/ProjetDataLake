    "text": "Baba Ramdev ()(or Ramdevji, or Ramdeo Pir, Ramsha Pir) (1352\u20131385 AD; V.S. 1409\u20131442) is a Hindu folk deity of Rajasthan, India. He was a fourteenth- century ruler, said to have miraculous powers, who devoted his life to the upliftment of the downtrodden and poor people of society. He is worshiped by many social groups of India as Ishta-deva.History goes that five Pirs from Mecca came to test his miraculous powers and after being convinced, paid their homage to him. Since then, he has been venerated by Muslims as Ramshahpir or Ramapir. Parcha of Ramdevpir Why do Muslims call Ramdevji \"Ramshahpir\" or \"Ramapir\"? The Pirs and Fakirs intentions were to bring disgrace upon Ramdevji, instead they blessed him and Musapir announced that Ramdevji from now on will be known as Ramshahpir, Ramapir or Hindawapir in the whole world and all the Pirs and Fakirs present hailed to Ramdevji \"Jai Ramapir, Jai Ramapir\". He is regarded as an incarnation of Vishnu.https://m.timesofindia.com/india/Hindus-converge-at-Ramapir-Mela-near- Karachi-seeking-divine-help-for-their-security/articleshow/16557691.cms ==Background== Ramdev is considered to be an incarnation of Vishnu. Ramdev was born on Bhadra Shukla Dooj in c.1405 in a Meghwansi family at Ramderiya. In Rajasthan, Ramdev is the chief deity of the Meghwal community, worshiped during Vedwa Punam (August \u2013 September). The community's religious leader, Gokuldas, claims that Ramdev was himself a Meghwal(jaipal) in his 1982 book Meghwal Itihas, which constructs a history of the Meghwal community. However, this is a claim accepted only by the Meghwal community themselves. Muslims venerate Ramdev as Ramshah Pir or Rama Shah Peer. He was said to have had miraculous powers and his fame reached far and wide. Legend has it that five Pirs from Mecca came to test Ramdev's powers. Ramdev welcomed them, and requested them to have lunch with him. The Pirs declined, saying that they ate only with their personal utensils, which were in Mecca. At this, Ramdev smiled and said look your utensils are coming and they saw that their eating bowls were coming flying in air from Mecca. After being convinced of his abilities and powers, they paid their homage to him and named him Rama Shah Peer. The five Pirs, who came to test his powers, were so impressed by him that they decided to stay with him. Their graves are located near Ramdev's samadhi. Ramdev believed in the equality of all human beings, be they high or low, rich or poor. He helped the down-trodden by granting them their wishes. He is often depicted on horseback. His followers are spread across in Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, Mumbai, Delhi and also in Sindh in Pakistan. Several fairs in Rajasthan are held to commemorate him. Temples in his name are found in many states of India.===Story of Ramdev Pir== Devotees during the two-month carnival at Ramdevra, Rajasthan, India ==Samadhi and Main Temple in Ramdevra== Ramdevji Samadhi Darshan, Ramdevra, Rajasthan Ramdevji Samadhi Darshan, Ramdevra, Rajasthan Ramdev took Samadhi at Ramdevra (10 km from Pokhran) in Rajasthan, on Bhadrapada Shukla Ekadashi in V.S. 1442 at the age of 37 years.

Gopal Bajaj is a singer and musician from Hyderabad, best known for his performances for many Ramdevji bhajans. 24 Banis are considered as famous literature composed by Ramdev. Many poets and followers like Harji Bhati, Raja Mansinh, Likhmauji Mali, Vijoji Sani, Hiranand Mali, Devshi Mali and Rani Rupande composed folk-tales about him which are still sung by his followers. ==Folklore== One day, young Ramdev wanted to play with a toy horse. His father gave a toymaker sandalwood and new cloth to make a wooden horse. The toymaker, however, stole most of the new cloth for his wife, and made the wooden horse from a piece of old cloth, with only a cover from new cloth. When Ramdev sat on the horse it began to fly and disappeared into the sky along with the child. Ramdev's parents got angry with the toymaker and imprisoned him. Shortly afterward, Ramdev came back along with the horse and accused the toymaker of cheating. The toymaker confessed his crime and begged for forgiveness. Ramdev forgave him and accepted the horse. Wooden toy horses covered with cloth are among the most popular offerings at the temples dedicated to him. == See also == * Ramdevra * Khatushyamji == References == == External links == * Ramapeer Dham * Amrut Akshay Dham * Baba Ramdev Parcha * Conversions and Shifting Identities: Ramdev Pir and the Ismailis in Rajasthan/Dominique-Sila Khan, 1997 * Journal Article, THE COMING OF NIKALANK AVATAR: A MESSIANIC THEME IN SOME SECTARIAN TRADITIONS OF NORTH-WESTERN INDIA, DOMINIQUE-SILA KHAN, Journal of Indian Philosophy, Vol. 25, No. 4 (August 1997), pp. 401-426 * ISMAILISM IN THE SUBCONTINENT: \"AN INNOVATIVE SYNTHESIS\" * Muslim Saints and Hindu Rulers: The Development of Sufi and Ismaili Mysticism in the Non-Muslim States of India * Rama Pir Sufi Saint of Sindh and Hind Category:14th-century people Category:14th-century rulers Category:Dargahs in India Category:Folk deities of Rajasthan Category:Hinduism and Islam Category:Regional Hindu gods Category:Sufi shrines in India ",
