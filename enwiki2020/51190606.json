The band was formed by Thom Rylance (vocals/guitar), Robert Lally (guitar/vocals), Katie Lloyd (bass/vocals), and Joe Singleton (drums). ==History== Formed in 2008, original drummer Alex Langford-Taylor was subsequently replaced by long-time friend Joe Singleton, otherwise the line-up has stayed constant since then. Their 2016 song \"Young Love\" was called a \"solid slice of catchy, jingly-jangly, indie-pop\" by CDNX. Lottery Winners signed to Modern Sky UK in 2019. They released their first single, \"Hawaii\", with the label in September 2019. Their debut self-titled studio album reached number 23 on the UK Albums Chart in March 2020. ==Discography== ===Albums=== * The Lottery Winners (March 2020) No. 23 UK ===Singles=== *\"Elizabeth\" (April 2013) *\"I Know\" (October 2015) *\"Young Love\" (April 2016) *\"That's Not Entertainment\" (November 2018) *\"Hawaii\" (September 2019) *\"Little Things\" (November 2019) *\"21\" (January 2020) *\"Headlock\" (February 2020) ==References== ==External links== * Lottery Winners official website Category:Musical groups established in 2008 Category:Musical groups from Manchester Category:British indie pop groups Category:Sire Records artists Category:Warner Records artists ",
