    "text": "The DB Baureihe 120 is a class of electric locomotives operated by DB Fernverkehr in Germany. ==Background and design== The locomotives' prototypes, delivered in 1979 (Mark 120.0), were one of the first electric locomotives with three-phase motors. They were based on experiences made in the 1970s with diesel-electric test platforms (Mark DE 2500/ DB Mark 202). In Norway, a new four-axle Locomotive, Mark El-17, was launched during 1983 with top speeds up to . The design was intended to be the first truly universal locomotive, capable of pulling fast passenger trains as well as heavy freight trains. While the electric equipment exceeded expectations, the mechanical part suffered from its lightweight construction necessitated by the heavy electronics of the time. After extensive tests, a series of 60 locomotives (Mark 120.1) were ordered in 1984 and delivered in 1986\u20131988. Original plans to build up to 2,000 machines were ultimately ended by DB's privatisation. The 120s went to DB Fernverkehr, the other divisions of Deutsche Bahn ordered locomotives that featured technologies from the 120, but were not direct successors. ==Technical data 120== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" |+ Sortable table |- ! scope=\"col\"| ! scope=\"col\" | 120.0 ! scope=\"col\" | 120.1 |- | General |- | Operator || DB || => |- | Manufacturing year || 1979-19xx || 1986\u20131988 |- | Number of manuf.|| 5 || 60 |- | Supplier mechanical part || Henschel, Krauss Maffei, Krupp || => |- | Supplier electrical part || BBC, Siemens, AEG || => |- | Axle arr || Bo-Bo || => |- | Weight || || => |- | Axle load || || => |- | Max tractive eff || || |- | Max speed || || |- | Body |- | Length || || => |- | Bogie distance || || => |- | Height over pantograph || || => |- | Body width || || => |- | Coupling || buffers and chain || => |- | Surface || smooth steel sheet || => |- | Colour || wine-red beige || red, white |- | Bogies |- | Track width || || => |- | Wheel base || || => |- | Wheel diameter, new || || => |- | Primary suspension || coil || => |- | Secondary suspension || coil || => |- | Brake || shoe, rheostatic, regenerative || shoe, regenerative |- | Bogie Weight || || => |- | Min hor radius || || => |- | Electrical equipment |- | Catenary voltage || 15 kV || => |- | Catenary frequency || 16 Hz || => |- | Max cont power || || => |- | Traction motor || QD646 || BQg 4843 |- | Max power trainheating || || => |} ==Gallery== Image:Dresden_Hbf_120_143.JPG|120 143 in Dresden Image:120-002.jpg|120 002 in W\u00fcrzburg 1984 Image:120 502-0 DB Systemtechnik, Dresden Hbf.jpg|DB-AG BR 120 (DB Systemtechnik), Summer 2006 in Dresden Main Station Image:DB 120 134.JPG|120 134 arrives at K\u00f6ln Hbf Image:DB 120 502.JPG|120 502 leaves K\u00f6ln Hbf on a Bahntechnik train. ==External links== * Spec Sheet; French Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1979 Category:Electric locomotives of Germany Category:15 kV AC locomotives Category:Bo\u2032Bo\u2032 locomotives 120 Category:Brown, Boveri & Cie locomotives Category:Henschel locomotives Category:Krauss-Maffei locomotives Category:Krupp locomotives Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Germany ",
