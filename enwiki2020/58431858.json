    "text": "Negative Capability is the twenty-first studio album by British singer and songwriter Marianne Faithfull. It was released on 2 November 2018, and produced by Rob Ellis, Warren Ellis and Head. Described as her \"most honest album\", songs on Negative Capability deal with themes of love, death, as well as terrorism and loneliness. She revisits three old recordings: \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\" from Rich Kid Blues, recorded in 1971 under the title Masques, which is her 'lost' album and was not released until 1985; \"Witches Song\", from 1979's comeback album Broken English; and \"As Tears Go By\", which started her career as a 17-year-old. Faithfull recorded it for the second time aged 40 on 1987's Strange Weather. The rest of the songs are, with one exception, all new and co-written by Faithfull with help from some of her long time collaborators like Nick Cave and Ed Harcourt. The \"Loneliest Person\" is a cover of a Pretty Things composition from their 1968 album S.F. Sorrow. The lead single, \"The Gypsy Faerie Queen\", was released on 14 September 2018. ==Background and development== The album was first announced in December 2017 in Faithfull's interview with Uncut. The album's title is a reference to the famous phrase \"negative capability\" used by Romantic poet John Keats in 1817 in a letter to his brothers. ==Music and lyrics== Described by Faithfull as \"the most honest record she's ever made\", Negative Capability has a \"folky\" feel. \"They Come at Night\" was written with Mark Lanegan following the November 2015 Paris attacks. Faithfull said she got the idea from producer Hal Willner, and his theory that every seventy years the Nazis return in some form or another. She debuted the song during her concert at the Bataclan theatre in November 2016, a year after the terrorist attack took its place there. ==Artwork and packaging== Shot by Yann Orhan, the cover art for the album was released on 5 September 2018. ==Singles== On 13 September 2018, \"The Gypsy Faerie Queen\" was serviced to several radio stations in Europe as the album's lead single. It was released to online music stores on 14 September 2018 along with the album becoming available for pre-order. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Marianne Faithfull \u2013 vocals * Nick Cave \u2013 backing & additional vocals, piano *Rob McVey - guitar, piano, synthesiser, backing vocals *Ed Harcourt - piano, bass guitar, baritone guitar, keyboards, wurlitzer, rhodes, organ, harmonium, backing vocals *Warren Ellis - viola, synthesiser, violin, keyboards, piano, alto flute, backing vocals, producer *Rob Ellis - drums, percussion, synthesiser, piano, thumbjam, glockenspiel, backing vocals, producer *Head - producer ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Spanish Albums (PROMUSICAE) | 85 |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Belgian Albums (Ultratop Flanders) | 143 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2018 albums Category:Marianne Faithfull albums ",
