In 1851, management of the post office was transferred from Britain (Royal Mail) to the provincial governments of the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. The position of Postmaster General was established in each province. With Canadian Confederation in 1867, a single position was created replacing this post in all of the above provinces except Newfoundland; this position was abolished in 1981 when the post office was transformed from a government department into a crown corporation. Since 1981 Canada Post is lead by a President and CEO. From 1900 until 1909 the Postmaster General was also responsible for the Department of Labour. It now reports to the Minister of Public Services and Procurement. ==Postmasters General== ;Alexander Campbell : under MacDonald (July 1, 1867 \u2013 June 30, 1873) ;John O'Connor : under Macdonald (July 1, 1873 \u2013 November 5, 1873) ;Donald Alexander Macdonald : under MacKenzie (November 7, 1873 \u2013 May 17, 1875) ;T\u00e9lesphore Fournier : under Mackenzie (May 19, 1875 \u2013 October 7, 1875) ;Lucius Seth Huntington : under Mackenzie (October 9, 1875 \u2013 October 8, 1878) ;Hector Louis Langevin : under Macdonald (October 19, 1878 \u2013 May 19, 1879) ;Sir Alexander Campbell : under Macdonald (May 20, 1879 \u2013 January 15, 1880) (second time) ;John O'Connor : under Macdonald (January 16, 1880 \u2013 November 7, 1880) (second time) ;Sir Alexander Campbell : under Macdonald (November 8, 1880 \u2013 May 18, 1881) (third time) ;John O'Connor : under Macdonald (May 20, 1881 \u2013 May 22, 1882) (third time) ;John Carling : under Macdonald (May 23, 1882 \u2013 September 24, 1885) ;Sir Alexander Campbell : under Macdonald (September 25, 1885 \u2013 January 26, 1887) (fourth time) ;Archibald McLelan : under Macdonald (January 27, 1887 \u2013 July 9, 1888) ;John Carling : under Macdonald (July 11, 1888 \u2013 August 5, 1888) (second time) ;John Graham Haggart : under Macdonald (August 6, 1888 \u2013 June 6, 1891) : under Abbott (June 16, 1891 \u2013 January 24, 1892) ;Sir Joseph Philippe Ren\u00e9 Adolphe Caron : under Abbott (January 25, 1892 \u2013 November 24, 1892) : under Thompson (December 5, 1892 \u2013 December 12, 1894) ;Louis-Olivier Taillon : under Mackenzie Bowell (December 21, 1894 \u2013 July 8, 1896) ;Sir William Mulock : under Laurier (July 13, 1896 \u2013 October 15, 1905) ;Allen Bristol Aylesworth : under Laurier (October 16, 1905 \u2013 June 3, 1906) ;Rodolphe Lemieux : under Laurier (June 4, 1906 \u2013 August 10, 1911) ;Henri S\u00e9v\u00e9rin B\u00e9land : under Laurier (August 19, 1911 \u2013 October 6, 1911) ;Louis-Philippe Pelletier : under Borden (October 10, 1911 \u2013 October 19, 1914) ;Thomas Chase-Casgrain : under Borden (October 20, 1914 \u2013 December 29, 1916) ;Pierre \u00c9douard Blondin : under Borden (January 8, 1917 \u2013 July 10, 1920) : under Meighen (July 10, 1920 \u2013 September 20, 1921) ;Louis-de- Gonzague Belley : under Meighen (September 21, 1921 \u2013 December 29, 1921) ;Charles Murphy : under King (December 29, 1921 \u2013 June 28, 1926) ;Robert James Manion : under Meighen (August 23, 1926 \u2013 September 25, 1926) ;Peter John Veniot : under King (September 25, 1926 \u2013 August 7, 1930) ;Arthur Sauv\u00e9 : under Bennett (August 7, 1930 \u2013 August 13, 1935) ;Samuel Gobeil : under Bennett (August 16, 1935 \u2013 October 23, 1935) ;John Campbell Elliott : under King (October 23, 1935 \u2013 January 22, 1939) ;Norman Alexander McLarty : under King (January 23, 1939 \u2013 September 18, 1939) ;Charles Gavan Power : under King (September 19, 1939 \u2013 May 22, 1940) ;James Lorimer Ilsley : (acting) : under King (May 23, 1940 \u2013 July 7, 1940) ;William Pate Mulock : under King (July 8, 1940 \u2013 June 8, 1945) ;Ernest Bertrand : under King (August 29, 1945 \u2013 November 15, 1948) : under St. Laurent (November 15, 1948 \u2013 August 23, 1949) ;Gabriel \u00c9douard Rinfret : under St. Laurent (August 25, 1949 \u2013 February 12, 1952) ;Alcide C\u00f4t\u00e9 : under St. Laurent (February 13, 1952 \u2013 August 7, 1955) ;Roch Pinard : (acting) : under St. Laurent (August 16, 1955 \u2013 November 2, 1955) ;Hugues Lapointe : under St. Laurent (November 3, 1955 \u2013 June 21, 1957) ;William McLean Hamilton : under Diefenbaker (June 21, 1957 \u2013 July 12, 1962) ;John Angus MacLean : (acting) : under Diefenbaker (July 18, 1962 \u2013 August 8, 1962) ;Ellen Louks Fairclough : under Diefenbaker (August 9, 1962 \u2013 April 22, 1963) ;Azellus Denis : under Pearson (April 22, 1963 \u2013 February 2, 1964) ;John Robert Nicholson : under Pearson (February 2, 1964 \u2013 February 14, 1965) ;Ren\u00e9 Tremblay : under Pearson (February 15, 1965 \u2013 December 17, 1965) ;Joseph Julien Jean-Pierre C\u00f4t\u00e9 : under Pearson (December 18, 1965 \u2013 April 20, 1968) : under Trudeau (April 20, 1968 \u2013 July 5, 1968) ;Eric William Kierans : under Trudeau (July 5, 1968 \u2013 April 28, 1971) ;Joseph Julien Jean-Pierre C\u00f4t\u00e9 : under Trudeau (April 29, 1971 \u2013 November 26, 1972) (second time) ;Andr\u00e9 Ouellet : under Trudeau (November 27, 1972 \u2013 August 7, 1974) ;Bryce Stuart Mackasey : under Trudeau (August 8, 1974 \u2013 September 13, 1976) ;Jean-Jacques Blais : under Trudeau (September 14, 1976 \u2013 February 1, 1978) ;Gilles Lamontagne : under Trudeau (February 2, 1978 \u2013 June 3, 1979) ;John Allen Fraser : under Clark (June 4, 1979 \u2013 March 2, 1980) ;
