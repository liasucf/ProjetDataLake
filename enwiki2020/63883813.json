Music director Devi Sri Prasad, whom he worked with in S/O Satyamurthy (2015) recommended him to Sukumar and thus enabled him to become the editor for Nannaku Prematho (2016). In 2019, he worked on Jersey. In a review of the film by The Teims of India, the reviewer wrote that \"Naveen Nooli too does a good job with the editing, with the film, despite its long runtime and laggy bits, not ending up seeming like a cricket documentary\". == Filmography == Source *Login (2012; Hindi) *Devaraya (2012) *Maaya (2014) *Govindudu Andarivadele (2014) *Romeo (2014) *Ladies & Gentlemen (2015) *Nannaku Prematho (2016) *Dhruva (2016) *Darsakudu (2017) *Tholi Prema (2018) *Rangasthalam (2018) *Aatagadharaa Siva (2018) *Ee Maaya Peremito (2018) *Aravinda Sametha Veera Raghava (2018) *Bluff Master (2018) *Mr. Majnu (2019) *Jersey (2019) *ABCD \u2013 American Born Confused Desi (2019) *Dorasaani (2019) *Ranarangam (2019) *Gang Leader (2019) *Arjun Suravaram (2019) *Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo (2020) *Bheeshma (2020) *Krack (TBA) *Solo Brathuke So Better (TBA) *Uppena (TBA) *Rang De (TBA) *Acharya (TBA) *2 States (TBA) == Awards == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
