    "text": "tej leo(?), Rx / pharmacists is the debut album by the Washington, D.C. rock band Ted Leo and the Pharmacists, released in 1999 by Gern Blandsten Records. Though considered the band's first album, it is actually a solo effort by Ted Leo with some contributions by Jodi V.B. of The Secret Stars. The following year Leo would assemble a backing band including V.B., which he named The Pharmacists. The album is largely experimental and blends rock music with elements of dub reggae, with many instrumental tracks, samples, and audio experimentation. This is exemplified in the various tracks entitled \"(version:),\" which are versions and remixes of \"Release Form,\" a song originally written by V.B. for The Secret Stars. The track \"(version: to decline to take a shower),\" for example, consists of Leo singing the song while showering. In other instances Leo samples himself, such as \"Walking Through,\" which contains a sample of \"Congressional Dubcision,\" and \"Out of Step '88!,\" which samples a radio interview that Leo did for campus radio station WFVI at the University of Notre Dame. ==Track listing== #\"Call Off the Invasion/Flydocious Invasion\" #*Contains samples of \"On Warmer Music\" and \"All My Kin\" by Chisel and \"Nightingale\" by The Secret Stars #\"The Pharmacist v.
