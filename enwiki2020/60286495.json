Members of the Big Sky Conference, the Wildcats were led by second-year head coach Neil McCarthy and played their home games on campus at Wildcat Gym in Ogden, Utah. They were overall in the regular season and in conference play. Weber State was second in the regular season standings and qualified for the four-team conference tournament, hosted by Idaho State in Pocatello. The Wildcats won their semifinal by a point over underdog but advanced to the final again, this time to host Idaho State; the teams had split the season series with home wins. The trend continued as Idaho State won the tournament final at home by six points. They advanced to the NCAA Tournament's Elite Eight, upsetting #2 UCLA in the Sweet Sixteen. It remains the best-ever showing in the NCAA Tournament by a Big Sky team. Weber State appeared in the first five finals of the conference tournament, winning the next three. This was the last season in Wildcat Gym (now Swenson Gym); the new Dee Events Center opened in November 1977. ==Postseason results== |- !colspan=5 style=| Big Sky Tournament ==References== ==External links== *Sports Reference \u2013 Weber State Wildcats: 1976\u201377 basketball season Category:Weber State Wildcats men's basketball seasons Weber State ",
