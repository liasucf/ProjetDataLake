Visitors may take a 30-minute self-guided audio tour of the Nautilus. ==History== The Electric Boat Company (EB) established the museum in 1955 as the Submarine Library. EB donated it to the Navy in 1964, and the Navy moved it to its current location next to Naval Submarine Base New London. It received its official title in 1969. The \"Connecticut Nautilus Committee\" was formed in 1984 to raise funds for an improved museum, hoping to convince the Navy to donate the Nautilus. A new facility was built with funding from the state, individuals, and businesses, opening in 1986. In late 1997, the Committee started planning and raising funds for a addition to the museum building. Fund raising started the next year, and the construction project ran from 1998 to early 2000. The new addition was officially opened to the public on April 28, 2000 \"in conjunction with the Centennial Celebration of the United States Submarine Force\", according to the museum.Web page titled \"The Submarine Force Library & Museum Association\" at the Submarine Force Library & Museum website, retrieved December 3, 2009 ==Collection and permanent exhibits== The museum has 33,000 artifactsWeb page titled \"The Submarine Force Library & Museum / Home of the USS Nautilus\" at the Submarine Force Library & Museum website, retrieved December 3, 2009 including the , the first nuclear-powered submarine in the world.
