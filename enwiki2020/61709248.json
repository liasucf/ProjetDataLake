    "text": "Super Happy Fun America (SHFA) is a Massachusetts political organization known for organizing the 2019 Boston Straight Pride Parade, a parade which attracted several hundred participants and thousands of counter-protesters. Super Happy Fun America and its leaders are known for their ties to white nationalism and the far-right,and the organization has been described by The Daily Beast as a front for the far-right organization Resist Marxism. == History == Super Happy Fun America is a non-profit organization that was founded in 2019 by John Hugo, Mark Sahady, and Samson Racioppi. The president of the organization is John Hugo, a former congressional candidate who in 2018 unsuccessfully ran for election to represent Massachusetts' 5th Congressional District. Hugo has said that Super Happy Fun America was established around the belief that straight people are an \"oppressed majority\". == Far-right and white nationalist ties == Super Happy Fun America has links to white nationalist individuals and organizations. The organization has been said to dog whistle white nationalists and alt-rightists, utilizing terms such as \"western culture\" and relating them not only to heterosexuality but to Caucasians and traditional values. Super Happy Fun America overlaps considerably with the Boston chapter of Resist Marxism, a far-right organization known for organizing the controversial 2017 Boston Free Speech Rally. Two of SHFA's founders, Mark Sahady and Samson Racioppi, are organizers for Resist Marxism; the third founder, John Hugo, was endorsed by Resist Marxism during his 2018 Congressional campaign. The Daily Beast has described Super Happy Fun America as a front for Resist Marxism. == Activities == === 2019 Boston Straight Pride Parade === two hands making the 'OK' gesture. Super Happy Fun America organized the August 31, 2019 Straight Pride Parade in Boston, Massachusetts, an event they described as \"a response to the 'identity politics' of the left.\" The event attracted several hundred participants and thousands of counter-protesters, who vastly outnumbered participants of the parade. Thirty- four counter-protesters were arrested at the event. Boston city councilor Michelle Wu suggested that police tactics and choice of equipment raised tensions between police and counter-protesters. On February 22, 2020, Super Happy Fun America held a rally outside of the Boston Police headquarters. Organizers said the rally was intended to thank police for arresting counter- protesters at the August 2019 parade, and to show support for a recent deployment of U.S. Customs and Border Protection immigration officers to Boston. The rally was again outnumbered by counter-protesters, who said they wished to expose SHFA's ties with white nationalism. The rally ended two hours before schedule, and no arrests were made. ===2020 Liberty Rally=== Super Happy Fun America named themselves as one of the hosts of the \"Liberty Rally\", an anti-lockdown protest held at the Massachusetts State House on May 4, 2020. The several hundred protesters who participated gathered to call for an end to the stay-at-home advisory and business closures that had been implemented to try to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Massachusetts. Protesters largely ignored physical distancing guidelines to stand six feet apart and to cover their noses and mouths. ==References== == External links == * Category:2019 establishments in Massachusetts Category:2019 in Massachusetts Category:2019 in American politics Category:Far-right politics in the United States Category:Organizations established in 2019 Category:Political organizations based in the United States Category:White nationalism in the United States ",
