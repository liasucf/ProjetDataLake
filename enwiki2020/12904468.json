The name malaanonan is derived from Tagalog (mala = false and anonang = custard apple) and is a putative vernacular name for this species. It is a large emergent tree, up to 60 m, found in mixed dipterocarp forests on deep friable clay soils. It can still be found in forest reserves in the east coast of Sabah although elsewhere it is threatened by habitat loss. The timber is a light hardwood sold under the trade name of white lauan or white seraya. ==References== malaanonan Category:Critically endangered plants Category:Trees of Borneo Category:Flora of Sabah Category:Trees of the Philippines Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Taxa named by Elmer Drew Merrill Category:Taxa named by Francisco Manuel Blanco ",
