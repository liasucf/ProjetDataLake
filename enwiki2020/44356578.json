Jovan Gligorijevi\u0107 (, ca. 1785\u20131813), known as Zeka Buljuba\u0161a (\u0417\u0435\u043a\u0430 \u0411\u0443\u0459\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0448\u0430), was a Serbian revolutionary captain (buljuba\u0161a) and nobleman active during the First Serbian Uprising. ==Early life== Gligorijevi\u0107 was born in ca. 1785, in Sjenica. His family hailed from Nevesinje. He was brought up working for Serb and Turkish merchants, from where he learnt to ride horses, use weapons, and the Turkish language. He went to school in a monastery. His parents called him zeka (rabbit) due to his green eyes. Zeka came to the Sanjak of Smederevo due to the outbreak of the First Serbian Uprising. Prior to the uprising, he lived in Vi\u0161egrad. A story goes that he left his home village after falling out with his close friend, a Turk from Nevesinje, after telling him about murdering a Turk man who was about to rape a Serb widow, his neighbour; the friend told Zeka that his Islamic faith could not look over this, and suggested a gun duel; Zeka shot him in the shoulder and immediately left his home for Vi\u0161egrad. He was not yet 20 years old at that time. ==Career== At first, Zeka served in the band (\u010deta) of vojvoda Stojan \u010cupi\u0107 in Ma\u010dva, then served as border protection by the Drina (towards the Bosnia Eyalet). He was usually posted in Para\u0161nica near Crna Bara. Zeka formed a \u010deta of 50\u2013200 men, called the Goli Sinovi (\"Naked Sons\", a term for homeless and familyless people), or Gola\u0107i. Although implying poverty, the soldiers were later richly dressed and armed. Zeka and his band also participated in great battles, such as Le\u0161nica and Loznica, but especially successfully watched Turkish movements and intercepted troops. After receiving the rank of buljuba\u0161a, he became known by the people as \"Zeka Buljuba\u0161a\". He commanded a band (\u010deta) of vagabonds, who were sometimes dressed in broadcloth, though armed with the most beautiful weapons. In 1813 his band fought on the Drina river. When the band's ammunition ran out, they rushed the Ottomans with knives and were all killed, near Zasavica. ==Legacy== Du\u0161an Baranin wrote two novels on his life, Zeko Buljuba\u0161a (1954) and Gola\u0107i (1966). A football club in Ravnje bears his name. Also, his descedants are Savkic family, named after his brother Savko . ==See also== * List of Serbian Revolutionaries ==References== ==Sources== * * * Category:19th-century Serbian people Category:People of the First Serbian Uprising Category:Serbian military leaders Category:Serbian rebels Category:People from Sjenica Category:Serbian military personnel killed in action Category:1785 births Category:1813 deaths ",
