    "text": "Petasites frigidus, the Arctic sweet coltsfoot or Arctic butterbur, is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family Asteraceae. It is native to Arctic to cool temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in northern Europe, northern Asia and northern North America. It is a herbaceous perennial plant producing flowering stems in early spring, and large leaves through the summer. The upright flowering stems are 10\u201320 cm tall, and bear only 5-12 inflorescences, yellowish-white to pink in colour. The leaves are rounded, 15\u201320 cm broad, with a deeply cleft base and shallowly lobed margin, and rise directly from the underground rootstock. The underside of the leaves is covered with matted, woolly fuzz. It grows in moist shaded ground, preferring stream banks and seeping ground of cut-banks. P. f. var. palmatus fruit and leaves While there is some disagreement, some sources identify five varieties of P. frigidus: *Petasites frigidus var. frigidus *Petasites frigidus var. nivalis, sometimes referred to as P. nivalis or P. hyperboreus. This variety is common at subalpine and alpine elevations.Mathews, Daniel. Cascade-Olympic Natural History. Raven Editions, 1999, p. 186, *Petasites frigidus var. palmatus, sometimes referred to as P. palmatus, palmate coltsfoot, or western coltsfoot; m\u00e2l-\u0113-m\u0113\u2019 (Konkow language); or t\u00e4-t\u00e4-t\u0113\u2019;Chesnut, p. 408 p\u0113\u2019-w\u0113 is the root.Chesnut, p. 407 *Petasites frigidus var. sagittatus, arrowleaf sweet coltsfoot. *Petasites frigidus var. vitifolius ==Uses== The leaf stalks and flower stems (with flowers) are edible, and can be used as a vegetable dish. A salt-substitute can also be made by drying and then burning the leaves. This black, powdery substance will provide a salty taste. However, given the high likelihood of the presence of toxic unsaturated, diester pyrrolizidine alkaloids in this species, consumption should be very limited. ==References== *Germplasm Resources Information Network: Petasites frigidus ==External links== * * Category:Senecioneae Category:Flora of the Arctic Category:Flora of Norway Category:Flora of Finland Category:Flora of Sweden Category:Flora of Russia Category:Flora of Siberia Category:Flora of Alaska Category:Flora of Canada ",
