    "text": "Kurunegala Railway Station (, ) is a major station, situated in the Kurunegala District, North Western Province, Sri Lanka. It is the 5th railway station on the Northern Line and 39th overall from the Colombo Fort Railway Station, at an elevation of above sea level. The station is located away from Kurunegala's town centre. The station serves as a terminus for several trains, with all trains running on the Northern Line, Trincomalee Line, and Batticaloa Line, stopping at the station, however a number of Intercity express trains do not stop at the station. The station has a one platform with several passing loops or sidings and a crossing loop to facilitate the switching of terminating trains. == History == The Jaffna Railway Commission report published in 1891 recommended the construction of a new railway line (now known as the northern line) from Polgahawela to Kurunegala and a survey of a line to Jaffna. The line would join the Main Line at Polgahawela Junction, allowing trains to run to the capital, Colombo. Approval to construct the line was granted in 1892 and the new line to Kurunegala opened on 14 February 1894. Construction of the rest of Northern Line continued, and on 1 August 1905, the first train from Colombo arrived at Jaffna Railway Station. ==Continuity== ==Timetable== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |+ Kurunegala Railway Station Timetable !
