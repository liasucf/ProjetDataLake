    "text": "Greg Smith (born 25 March 1957) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with the South Melbourne/Sydney and Collingwood Football Clubs in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the 1980s. Rarely troubled by injury, Smith played at least 18 games in each of his five seasons at South Melbourne, earning him the nickname 'The Bionic Man'. He had come to the club from East Wagga and played his football mostly as a centreman or ruck-rover. Smith kicked 22 goals in 1982, five of them in a win over St Kilda at the SCG. He also polled well in the Brownlow Medal count that year with 11 votes, the second most for his club that season behind Barry Round. Smith finished his career in the SANFL where he played 100 games and kicked 90 goals for Central District. He debuted for them in 1987 and the following season won their 'Best & Fairest' award. In 1991 and 1992, his final two years with the club, he was captain. ==References== Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Australian rules footballers from New South Wales Category:Sydney Swans players Category:Collingwood Football Club players Category:Central District Football Club players Category:Victorian State of Origin players ",
