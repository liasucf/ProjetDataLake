(His example was later followed by the francophile Maharaja Jagatjit Singh, who constructed the famous French inspired Jagatjit Palace at Kapurthala). When he relocated to Jullunder, he built for himself another residence, Bikram Hall; it has since been demolished, though the grounds, now referred to as Bikrampura, still bear his name. ==Dispute with the Raja of Kapurthala== His father Raja Nihal Singh wanted him to succeed to the throne but this was opposed by the British. His father's will, which entitled him to inherit large estates, was challenged by his brother, Raja Randhir Singh. After long litigation, a settlement was arrived at by which Bikrama Singh was given a pension by the state; under the terms of this settlement, Bikrama Singh left Kapurthala to settle in Jullunder.Chief and Families of Note in The Punjab, Volume-II, Lahore-1910, Page-421Raja of The Punjab by Sir, Lepel Henry Griffin, Lahore-1870, Pages: 552-575 ==Settlement of estates through the Bikrama Singh Estates Act== He was the joint owner of the Kapurthala Estate in Awadh, Uttar Pradesh.

A settled amount was deposited into a Trust which was used to procure a fresh Estate for Bikrama Singh. The lands finally vested in Bikrama Singh in the districts of Sitapur and Rae Bareli in the United Provinces (present day Uttar Pradesh) were formalized by the central government through the Bikrama Singh Estates Act 1883 (an unrepealed Act of the Government of India). He died at Jullunder on 8 May 1887. ==See also== * Bikrama Singh's Estates Act * The Kapurthala Royal Collateral Families ==References== * A History of the Sikhs by Khushwant Singh, Volume-II : 1939-1974, Delhi, Oxford University Press, 1962, Page-141 * The Singh Sabha and Other Socio-Religious Movements in The Punjab (1850\u20131925), Punjabi University, Patiala, 1997, Page-29,46 * http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-10-08/chandigarh/27326746_1_classical- music-heritage-and-tourism-sikh * http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20031115/windows/main1.htm * Chief and Families of Note in The Punjab, Volume-II, Lahore-1910, Page-421 * The Raja of The Punjab by Sir, Lepel Henry Griffin, Lahore-1870, Pages: 552-575 * Chief and Families of Note in The Punjab, Volume-II, Lahore-1910, Page-421 * http://punjabrevenue.nic.in/gaz_kpt2.htm ==External links== * Kapurthala, princely state, genealogy Category:Indian Sikhs Category:People from Kapurthala Category:History of Sikhism Category:1835 births Category:1887 deaths Category:Punjabi people ",
