The second single officially released was \"Crying Out for Me\", with the music video premiering on September 17, 2007 on BET, again. Although not an official single, Mario did shoot a video for the song \"Do Right\" using clips from the MTV documentary surrounding his mother's substance abuse. It was released as a promotional single for the album. The official third (fourth in total) single was \"Music for Love\" which was released in April 2008. ==Recording and production== Mario worked with many producers on the album, most notably Scott Storch and Pharrell with whom he recorded a song called, \"Faith\".

Retrieved April 3, 2007 It was to be the first album in which Mario would use his full name. The album then had several release dates in 2007 including: April 4,MTVAsia.com \"Mario Changes LP Title, Reaches Out To Disadvantaged Kids\", December 2006. Retrieved January 20, 2007 May 8, July 31, August 21, October 9, and finally November 27 - coincidentally, exactly a year after the first date announced. The album was eventually released on December 10, 2007 in the United Kingdom and December 11, 2007 in the United States. In an interview Mario was asked on the delays of the album, \"Your second album, \"Turning Point\", was released back in December [2004], so who or what do you think is most responsible for the delay in-between the albums?\" Mario answered, that he had \"a few legal situations to work through, which set his album back 6 to 8 months\", adding that, he now has \"more control over his projects and albums he gets done.\" In 2007 Mario toured with Dijon Thomas, the tour was called Do Right Tour. In 2008, Mario was scheduled as the tour's opening act for all dates of Ms. Kelly Tour with Kelly Rowland, to promote his album Go. On July 2, 2008, Courtney Galliano & Joshua Allen from the U.S. television reality program and dance competition So You Think You Can Dance, danced to \"Skippin\" as the part of the competition. ==Critical response== Go received favorable reviews from critics. Andy Kellman of Allmusic gave the album four out of five stars, characterized the album as \"the singer's strongest release yet, easily apparent after one listen, a credit that can be distributed equally between an ever-improving artist and his collaborators\". He also said \"Go is indeed Mario's most aggressive and assertive album, but no other song comes close to out-vulgarizing \"Go\" itself.\" Mark Edward Nero from About.com said that \"Go is the first Mario album that carries a parental advisory sticker, and for very good reason. He stated too \"Mario has bitten a big chunk out of Usher's vocal style, plus added some R. Kelly-style raunch to his lyrics, seemingly to shake things up and throw some dirt on his previously squeaky clean image. But Mario's occasional bawdiness here is crude, distasteful and completely unnecessary,\" and gave the album three out of five stars. Nathan S. from DjBooth.net writes that \"it feels like \"How Do I Breathe\" dropped so long ago it must have been off his last album, but the fact that the Stargate-produced ballad still works is proof of its longevity. How Do I Breathe doesn\u2019t break new ground for Mario, it\u2019s probably the most immature song on the album, but I\u2019m secure enough in my manhood to admit I\u2019ve sung along in the car\". he ends saying \"That\u2019s why it\u2019s such a shame the lyrics are so shaky; the track opens with the declaration \u201cYou may be young but you\u2019re ready.\u201d I\u2019m sorry, what? Call me crazy, but the last thing I want to think about when I\u2019m listening to a slow jam is possible statutory rape charges. Then again, I\u2019m sure R. Kelly loved it. \"Right And A Wrong Way\" isn\u2019t the album\u2019s only slip-up; \"No Definition\", \"Let Me Watch\" and \"Music For Love\" all fall short of perfect, but if they sound lacking it\u2019s only because Mario\u2019s has raised the bar so high on the rest of the album\". He rates the album has four Spins Solid out of five Spins Solid. Shopie Bruce of BBC Music characterizes the album as \"A good mix of romantic ballads and up-tempo floorfillers.\" ==Chart performance== The album debut at #21 on the Billboard 200 with around 78,000 copies sold. As of January 15, 2009, has sold 331,540 copies in the U.S. ==Singles== * \"How Do I Breathe\" was released as the album's first single on May 15, 2007.
