Voltamp was an early American manufacturer of toy trains based in Baltimore, Maryland. Founded by Manes Fuld (1863\u20131929), the son of a Baltimore stove dealer, Voltamp's trains utilized the same 2-inch gauge metal track as Carlisle & Finch, the inventor of the electric toy train. It is significant for its 1907 release of the first electric toy train that operated on household alternating current; earlier electric trains had used battery power. Voltamp released its first toy train product in 1903. Although Voltamp outlasted Carlisle & Finch, its primary competitor, both companies were eclipsed in the marketplace by the Ives Manufacturing Company and Lionel Corporation, and Voltamp exited the market in 1922, selling its line to Boucher. ==References== *Voltamp Trains: The Train Collectors Association *Voltamp at Historytoy.com Category:Toy train manufacturers Category:Defunct manufacturing companies of the United States Category:Manufacturing companies disestablished in 1922 Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1903 Category:1903 establishments in Maryland Category:1922 disestablishments in Maryland ",
