He is noted as a leading militarist in the struggle for the independence of Ecuador and other South American countries. Admiral Thomas Charles Wright ==Childhood== Thomas Wright was born in Queensboro, Drogheda, Ireland, on 26 January 1799, the son of Joseph Wright and Mary Montgomery. At the age of 11 he was sent to the Royal Navy college at Portsmouth, at that time regarded as the finest in the world, where he studied to become an officer. ==Career in the Royal Navy== Following his junior office training, he embarked to sea at the age of 14 on board under the captaincy of George Stuart. On this vessel he sailed to the east coast of the United States where he was engaged in blockading activities in the squadron of Admiral Borlaise Warren. In 1817 he returned to England having attained the junior officer's rank of midshipman. ==South American campaigns for independence== Navy Ship commanded by Thomas Charles Wright With promotional opportunities diminishing in the Royal Navy, Wright having passed the Lieutenant's examination, but still without a commission, in union with many young junior officers in Britain he decided to enlist in Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar's revolutionary army and sail for South America in support of the uprisings against Spanish colonial rule. In November 1817 Wright enlisted as an officer in the British Legion of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, under the patronage of Luis Lopez Mendez, Bolivar\u2019s agent in London, he was one of the first to volunteers to enlist. Originally setting off from the River Thames in November 1817, several snags delayed the departure until 2 January 1818 then departing from Fowey harbour he sailed on a brigantine named Dowson, under naval commander Captain Dormer, with 200 other volunteers armed with valuable weapons and ammunition, and after several weeks they landed at the West Indies. In this army corps of 200 men he was under the command of Colonel Campbell, and they were known as the Rifles Corps. These troops were then placed under the command of Colonel Pigott \u2013 His Majesty 54th Foot. Admiral Brion arrived with his squadron on the Island of St Thomas and Pigott and his followers were shipped on Patriot vessels to Margarita Island off the coast of Venezuela arriving on 21 April 1818. They were sent to Guayana and then to Angostura, thus beginning the campaign in the Apure. At Angostura (present-day Ciudad Bol\u00edvar Wright first met Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, for whom he developed a deep admiration. Bol\u00edvar opened the liberating campaign in Apure. During 1818\u20131819, one of his earliest battles with Wright partaking as an officer was at Trapiche de Gamarra on 27 March 1819. These encounters inspired Bol\u00edvar to begin his New Granada campaign and the march over the Andes. Wright accompanied Bol\u00edvar on the legendary crossing on which 25% of the British/Irish troops died. He took part in the entire land campaign to liberate the northern countries of South America, and fought with in numerous land battles with Bol\u00edvar's army, including, Pantano De Varges on 25 July, the Battle of Boyac\u00e1 on 7 August 1819, Cienega de Santa Martha on 10 November 1820, and the Battle of Carabobo on 24 June 1821. Further battles included Bombona on 7 April 1822 and Pasto in September 1822. Wright was to play leading roles in the Vargas Swamp Battle, and later in the victory at Boyac\u00e1 in August 1819, after which he was promoted to captain. In 1820 he returned with his Rifles regiment to the coastal plains to campaign in the jungles east of the Magdalena against the Spanish based on Santa Marta. He fought at the Battle of Ci\u00e9naga on 10 November 1820, the outcome resulted in the capture of the town. The Rifles Corp were then transported by sea to Maracaibo, and on 21 June 1821 partook in Simon Bol\u00edvar's decisive victory at Carabobo. Cartagena was also seized and the Rifles were brought in boats up the Magdalena en route to Popay\u00e1n. They formed part of the forces led by Bol\u00edvar in the second of his famed Andean campaigns. After the successful battle at Bombon\u00e1 on 7 April 1822, Wright was twice mentioned in Bol\u00edvar's order of the day for his exceptional skill and courage. Again he was promoted and from February 1822 Wright was acting lieutenant-Colonel, a rank to which was later confirmed in 1823, when he was serving under General Sucre, who joined up forces with Bol\u00edvar in Ecuador. In 1823 the Rifles were shipped to Peru. ==Independence struggle and naval battles== Thomas Charles Wright in action against a superior ship In early 1824, Bol\u00edvar knew that despite the Patriot Army success on land unless the South American revolutionary armies could control the seas off their coasts they would forever be under sea blockade from imperial Spain. General Bolivar appointed Wright to the newly fledged united pacific naval squadron. After Guayaquil seized independence, a young British naval officer John Illingworth Hunt, was appointed as Commanding General of the Maritime Department. Immediately he took care of organizing everything concerning the Navy, The new government was acquiring some ships indispensable for the maintenance of the Grancolombiana sovereignty in the Pacific. Thus, in 1823, the first Ecuadorian naval force was formed with the following warships; the schooner Guayaquile\u00f1a, the brig Chimborazo and the corvette Pichincha. Wright, who in February 1824 was promoted to captain, became Commodore of the South Squadron, and embarked on the brig Chimborazo, where he had his flag pennant hoisted, and conducted patrols along the Peruvian coast with seven transports properly equipped and ready to assist in the transfer of troops, when Bol\u00edvar, who was with his army in Peru, would require it. Bol\u00edvar with his army defeated the royalist forces at the Battle of Jun\u00edn on 6 August 1824. After this, Wright was instructed to proceed to Callao with a squadron of five ships and was placed under the orders of Admiral Martin Guise, head of the United Squadron. The Grancolombian units, forming this squadron, participated in some naval actions against the royalists and also in the blockade of Callao, the last Spanish stronghold in South America. Bol\u00edvar installed him as a Commodore of the Pacific Southern Squadron, He was appointed to command this small fleet of ships including Chimborazo, Guayaquile\u00f1a, Pichincha, and other minor vessels in support of Admiral Martin Guise and joined the Patriotic naval force blockading off Callao. Wright, Admiral Martin Guise, and a handful of other former Royal Navy officers spearheaded the blockade of Callao that successfully fought the Spanish naval squadron sent to lift the blockade of the besieged city. The first ship under his command was Guayaquile\u00f1a, formerly Lady Collier. During the blockade the Spanish royalist ships based in Callao tried to run the blockade and escape, and became engaged in combat with the blockading fleet. He was highly praised for his action. During the exchanges Wright's brigantine Chimborazo sustained three water-line hits and collided with the ship 'Asia', but he prised himself free and escaped. The blockade held and Callao capitulated in early 1826 and Spanish rule in South America was at a close. During this period Wright on Chimborazo had become personally close to Bol\u00edvar and he ferried him from port to port over the entire Pacific coast. Bol\u00edvar while at sea was at most risk of capture and at his most vulnerable and his aides strongly advised against these sea voyage risks. Despite this Bol\u00edvar continued to sail with Wright one of his original officers on voyages from port to port. ==Founding father of the Ecuadorian Navy== Admiral Thomas Charles Wright Memorial Guayaquil The revolutionary independence struggles ended with the unfolding liberation of South America countries, and Wright settled in Ecuador where he helped establish the Ecuadorian Navy and helped create the Ecuadorian naval school that was named in his honour. ==Post independence war with Peru== The downfall and expulsion of the Spanish colonial power later led to land disputes and new wars among the South American home nations that once were united against Spain. In 1827, Peruvian President Jos\u00e9 Lamar invaded Bolivia, then invaded Ecuador. Wright had settled in Ecuador after the ousting of the Spanish, and now he took up the cause of defending his new adopted homeland. Wright's navy fought two battles with the Peruvians in the Gulf of Guayaquil. ==Battle of Punta Malpelo== President Bol\u00edvar resolved to declare war against Peru on 3 June 1828. Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre, who had been the President of Bolivia since 1826, resigned his office (under duress) and was appointed Commander of the Gran Colombian Army. The Peruvian declaration of war against Gran Colombia occurred on 3 July 1828 when the Peruvian Government, under President Jose de La Mar, ordered a mobilization of its ground and naval forces. The first engagement of the conflict took place on 31 August of that year when the Peruvian corvette Libertad, under the command of Carlos Garc\u00eda del Postigo, on patrol in international waters to the west of the Gulf of Guayaquil with the purpose of blockading that port, was attacked by the Gran Colombian ships Pichincha and Guayaquile\u00f1a under the command of Thomas Charles Wright, off Punta Malpelo. During the battle both sides were forced to disengage with heavy loss of life on board their vessels. Wright was injured in the fighting as was Postigo who was severely wounded and fled, and the blockade on the city was lifted. ==Assault on Guayaquil== The Peruvian squadron, commanded by Admiral Jorge Martin Guise, made a number of raids in the area of Guayaquil before directly attacking the defenses of that city from 22 November to 24 November 1828. In this campaign, he managed to eliminate the Ecuadorian/Colombian defenses afloat and to silence much of the enemy artillery, but, on the night of 23 November, the Peruvian frigate Presidente ran aground, and the Colombians took advantage of the situation to counterattack. At dawn, with the arrival of high tide, the frigate was refloated under fire. One of the last enemy sniper shots hit Guise, mortally wounding him. Control of the squadron was assumed by his first lieutenant, Jos\u00e9 Boter\u00edn, who continued the siege. The city finally surrendered on 19 January 1829. After this victory, the corvette Arequipe\u00f1a and the brig Congreso repaired to Panama to rescue a Peruvian merchant ship that had been captured by the Gran Colombians. Guayaquil would remain under Peruvian occupation until 21 July 1829. ==Return to the army== Memorial on city street of Guayaquil, Ecuador In 1829 he went back in the army he was as a Colonel, appointed General Sucre's Aid de Camp at Portete de Tarqui. ==Independence of Ecuador== Equador declared itself a republic in 1830, though the region was completely unsettled with Peru and Colombia both claiming parts of Ecuador as part of their territory. At this time he went back in the Navy (with his own flag officer's pendant). He was also appointed to the army with the rank of General of Brigade in 1830. ==Civil war== Two unconstitutional presidents had declared themselves in office \u2013 Rocafuerte and Valdivieso. Wright and Flores led Rocafuerte's army into a decisive battle that took place at Minarica in 1835. This action was decisive and they defeated General Barriga, who was Valdivieso's appointed General. The victory guaranteed the stability and future of Ecuador, with Rocafuerte becoming Ecuador's president. ==Admiral of the Fleet and Army General== Ecuadorian naval admiral Thomas Charles Wright In 1835, he was Comandante del Apostadero, later changed to Comandancia General de la Marina for many years. Translated to English, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. He did not found the Ecuadorian Naval School as often incorrectly cited. The college was named after him. He was the commanding officer of the Ecuadorian Naval Squadron before Ecuador became a Republic, as such he is considered a founding father of the Ecuadorian Navy. In this year he was also promoted to Army General of Division. ==Military coup and exile== In 1845, a military coup plot overthrew the liberal government supported by Wright and he went into exile in Chile and Peru He went into exile for fifteen years, ten years in Chile and five in Peru. In Chorrillos, Peru he befriended the Ecuadorian exile Eloy Alfaro and exerted a massive influence on him as a mentor. He would later become President from 1897\u20131913. he returned from exile in 1860 and opposed Garcia Moreno until his death. ==Governor of Guayaquil== In 1843 he became the Governor of Guayaquil.
