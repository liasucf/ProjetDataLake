    "text": "Furnaceland (English derived place name, meaning \"field where the iron was smelted in the furnace\") is a townland in the civil parish of Kinawley, barony of Tullyhaw, County Cavan, Ireland. The original Irish place name was Maghernavinagh, which in Gaelic was either Machaire Eanach, meaning \"The Plain of the Marsh\" or Machaire Mhianach, meaning \"The Plain of the Mine\"). The town of Swanlinbar is partially situated in Furnaceland. N87 Bawn Road, Swanlinbar (geograph 3595601) ==Geography== Furnaceland is bounded on the north by Hawkswood townland, on the south by Gorteen (Kinawley) and Killaghaduff townlands, on the west by Cornalon and Gorteennaglogh townlands and on the east by Drumconra (or Lowforge), Gortacashel and Uragh (Kinawley) townlands. Its chief geographical features are Furnaceland Hill, which reaches a height of 328 feet, the River Cladagh (Swanlinbar), the Blackwater river which later joins the Cladagh, a forestry plantation and dug wells, including the \"Steel Well\". Furnaceland is traversed by the national secondary N87 road (Ireland), the local L1031 road, minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 365 statute acres. ==History== In medieval times Furnaceland was owned by the McGovern Clan and formed part of a ballybetagh spelled (variously) Aghycloony, Aghcloone, Nacloone, Naclone and Noclone (Irish derived place name \u00c1th Chluain, meaning the \"Ford of the Meadow\"). The 1609 Baronial Map depicts the ballybetagh as Naclone. In the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 26 June 1615, King James VI and I granted, inter alia, The precinct or parcel of Nacloone otherwise Aghcloone to Sir George Graeme and Sir Richard Graeme to form part of the Manor of Greame. A history of Richard and George Graham is viewable online. The Grahams took part in the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and after the war their lands were confiscated under the Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652. The 1658 Down Survey map depicts the townland as Enean. In 1766 Furnaceland was one of the first Methodist communities founded in County Cavan. A Methodist Pioneer: or the Life and Labours of John Smith by Charles Henry Crookshank (1885) states on page 196, \"In 1766, however, in connection with the zealous and faithful labours of John Smith, a large number of Societies were formed, including those at Mullalougher, Killashandra, Bawnboy, Belturbet, Cavanagh, Ballyconnell, Swanlinbar, Furnaceland and Gortnaleg.\" The 1821 Census of Ireland spells the name as \"Mearaveny or Furnish Land and Macraveny and Macreveny and Macreeveny\" and states, \"contains 148 acres of arable & pasture land & 15 acres of bog- there is also a church & burial ground on same\". The 1825 Tithe Applotment Books spell the name as Furnaceland and Maugheraveey. The 1836 Ordnance Survey Namebooks state, \"In this land, the iron-works were carried on. There is the ruins of an iron foundary which has not been used these many years\". The Furnaceland Valuation Office Field books are available for 1838-1840. Griffith's Valuation lists fifty-five landholders in the townland. Folklore from Furnaceland is found in the 1938 D\u00fachas collection. ==Census== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year ! Population !

In the 1911 census of Ireland, there were ten families listed in the townland. ==Antiquities== # A medieval earthen ringfort. The 'Archaeological Inventory of County Cavan' (Dublin: Stationery Office, 1995), Site no. 703, describes it as \"Raised circular area (int. diam. c. 26m) enclosed by a slight external earthen bank with a deep internal waterlogged fosse.

Appraisal- A handsome church designed by Joseph Welland (1798-1860) who in his capacity as architect to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners designed over one hundred churches across the country for the Church of Ireland. This building is well designed and executed and retains its historic form and character and much of its original fabric and interior fittings, including wall monuments of social and historical interest. The church is a key part of the social heritage of the area, and forms a striking landmark on the southern outskirts of the town.

Square-headed window to west, door opening to gable, now boarded up. Interior composed of two-bay nave to south having remnants of original furnishings. Set along street building line, raised above pavement level on sloping site. Appraisal- A building of understated simplicity, typical of churches built in rural areas in the early nineteenth century by the Methodist congregation. The church retains an elegant row of Georgian style pointed windows which are a key feature defining the architectural character of the main street of Swanlinbar. The church was closed in the 1960s due to the declining Methodist population and together with the former Manse serves as a reminder of the former religious diversity in this part of the county. # Ben View Primitive Methodist Church, now a private residence. # Trivia House, Swanlinbar.
