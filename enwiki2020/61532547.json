Stephen Saito wrote \u201cJules of Light and Dark is the rare film where you not only witness a meaningful change for the characters, but suspect they\u2019ll continue to evolve long after the cameras stop rolling, if for no other reason than you feel as if you\u2019ve experienced a change yourself from seeing it.\" == References == Category:American films Category:American drama films ",
