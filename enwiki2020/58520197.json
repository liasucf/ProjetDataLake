    "text": "The Vo\u0107in massacre was the killing of 350 Serb civilians in Vo\u0107in, Independent State of Croatia, by the Usta\u0161e Croatian fascist organization on 14 January 1942, during World War Two. The massacre was carried out as retaliation for partisans' action in Papuk. == Background == On 12 January 1942, in a direct fight between the Partisans and the Usta\u0161e, five Usta\u0161e were killed, and two wounded, one of whom died later. The Partisans withdrew to Papuk, and Usta\u0161e returned to Vo\u0107in and waited for reinforcements from Osijek, Beli\u0161\u0107e and Virovitica. == Massacre == On 13 January, some 300 Usta\u0161e and Domobran soldiers began with plundering and burning Serbian houses. Civilians who tried to escape or provided resistance were killed and all others were arrested and taken to Vo\u0107in. On Serbian New Year, January 14, the biggest slaughter of the innocent population in Slavonia at that time started. Almost all the male inhabitants of the villages Jorgi\u0107i, Zubovi\u0107i, Dobri\u0107i, Kometnik and Sekulinci were killed. During the massacre, a total of 350 civilians were killed. === Acts of individual heroism === In addition to the victims, some managed to save many Serbs from Vo\u0107in and its surroundings. The Croat gendarme sergeant Luke Mustafi\u0107 managed to save the lives of 10 Serbs during the massacre. == Aftermath == On the following day, Usta\u0161e transported Serb corpses to a mass grave that was excavated east of Vo\u0107in, along the Vo\u0107inka river. The most significant consequence of this crime was strengthening of the partisan movement in the area of Vo\u0107in and Podravska Slatina, exactly the opposite effect of what NDH's authorities tried to achieve. Although during 1941 and early 1942 there were not many local residents in favor of active resistance, due to increasing existential threat, a large number of Serbs from the surrounding villages joined the partisan units. A memorial to the victims of this massacre was erected in 2007. == References == Category:Mass murder in 1942 Category:Massacres in the 1940s Category:Massacres in the Independent State of Croatia Category:Independent State of Croatia Category:Massacres in Yugoslavia Category:Massacres of Serbs Category:January 1942 events Category:1942 in Croatia Category:Yugoslavia in World War II ",
