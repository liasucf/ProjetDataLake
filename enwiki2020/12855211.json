While Hurricane Dean was affecting the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and the Gulf of Mexico, and Tropical Storm Erin was affecting Oklahoma and Texas, a persistent storm system hung over the Midwest for several days, causing repeated flash flooding in the US states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. Cool Canadian air clashed with large quantities of warm moist air from the Gulf, producing torrential rains along a stationary front. Eighteen deaths across the central United States were attributed to the resulting flooding. Seven Minnesota counties, eight Ohio counties, fourteen counties in Wisconsin, and seven counties in Illinois were declared Federal Disaster Areas. ==Meteorological synopsis== Radar estimated rainfall totals from August 18\u201325, 2007.Weather map from National Weather Service On Saturday, August 18, a warm front pushed northward into Iowa and Illinois, where it became stationary. Warm, moist air pushing over the frontal boundary fueled showers and thunderstorms that moved in a west-to-east fashion, training over the same areas for hours at a time. Some parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa saw moderate to heavy rain for nearly a full day before the activity finally cleared out. Additional thunderstorms formed over these areas on Sunday, August 19, exacerbating the flooding problems. Tropical Storm Erin had pushed into the coast of Texas on August 15, and by August 18 had stalled over Oklahoma. Though the remnants of Erin did not directly impact the flooding in these areas, moisture from Erin streamed northward, enhancing the thunderstorm activity for two to three days.Title The stationary front and associated energy then extended eastward through Illinois, Indiana and Ohio on August 19 and August 20. Similarly, the front was the focus for thunderstorm development, and the precipitation continued moving over the same areas, leading to extended periods of heavy rainfall. Approximately 1,000,000 homes lost electricity due to the storms. Runoff from the heavy rain also caused river flooding to the south of the affected areas. The Rock River near Joslin, Illinois peaked at 17.11 feet, above flood stage. Moderate flooding was also reported on the Mississippi River from the Quad Cities to St. Louis, Missouri. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=\"4\"|Summary of Casualties and Damage |- |State||Counties affected||Fatalities||Estimated Damage |- |Illinois ||7 ||2 ||$22.8 million |- |Indiana ||1 ||0 ||$5 million |- |Iowa || ||1 ||$8 million |- |Minnesota ||7 ||7 ||$179 million |- |Ohio ||6 ||1 ||$241 million |- |Wisconsin ||5 ||3 ||$93 million |} ==Illinois== The Rock River cascading over the Oregon Dam on August 25, between Dixon and Byron, Illinois. See comparison photo. The city of Rockford, Illinois was deluged in the weeks preceding the major flooding during the third week of August. On August 7, Rockford was hit by five to seven inches (127\u2013178 mm) of rain. Many streets, including main thoroughfares, were flooded. There was also fear that the Alpine Dam might break.Kelokhe, Smita. \"Rockford's flooding same story again for dozens of victims,\" 13 WREX-TV (NBC), August 8, 2007.

With this declaration, he dispatched both the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources to assist the city. Debris removal, law enforcement, damage assessment, and other physical assistance were offered by the governor. The Rock River poured into this riverside park in Byron, Illinois on August 24\u201325. Two weeks later on August 23, violent storms rolled through most of the Chicago metropolitan area. Tornado warnings were issued during the first round of storms, which produced wind gusts as high as 80 miles per hour (130 km/h); the highest being reported in Manhattan. A small tornado was reported in Bolingbrook in a DuPage County Forest Preserve. The storms shut down airports (including O'Hare International Airport and Midway International Airport), uprooted trees and left over 600,000 residents in northern Illinois without power, some for several days. NBC 5 News The storms also caused flooding on streets and major expressways such as the Bishop Ford Freeway. Rainfall totals in Boone and LaSalle Counties topped 1987 records. Governor Rod Blagojevich declared McHenry, Lake, Cook (including Chicago), DuPage, and Kane counties to be disaster areas after the storm. Flooding across northern Illinois was widespread in the aftermath of the storms.

Twenty-four- hour rainfall totals of 15.10 inches (384 mm) were recorded in Hokah, which easily broke the old state record of 10.84 inches (275 mm). An unofficial twenty-four-hour total of over 17 inches (432 mm) was recorded near Caledonia.

The highest total for the entire event was 18.17 inches (462 mm) near La Crescent. Washed out road in Witoka, Minnesota Southeast Minnesota and southwestern Wisconsin are in the Driftless Area, which was not covered by the last glaciation, and therefore is not covered by deep layers of glacial till. The soils therefore are thin and less able to retain water; they lie atop porous rock into and through which surface waters can rapidly drain into the water table. The highly dissected topography, characterized by steep hills and bluffs and deep coulees, gives steep gradients to the drainage and makes streams highly erosive. As the rains far exceeded the absorption rate of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in six hours, flash floods rapidly overflowed the water courses and spread across the valley floors. The towns of Stockton, Houston, Elba, Minnesota City, and portions of Winona, on the Mississippi River, were evacuated. Citizens were moved to Saint Mary's University in Winona, Lewiston, and Caledonia, Minnesota. Massive bluffs gave way in Brownsville and several homes were completely washed away. Governor Tim Pawlenty ordered 240 National Guard soldiers to help and declared a state of emergency in six counties. The Minnesota Army National Guard soldiers guarded communities that were cleared out after the flooding early August 19. The Army Corps of Engineers opened up the floodgates on the rising Root River to release some of the water creating pressure on the dike in Houston.Floods In Minnesota, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, Kill 13 CBS 3 Philadelphia.

The Blanchard River was 7.5 feet (2 m) above flood level in Findlay, the highest level since 1913. A 92-year-old man drowned trying to get to safety after his car became trapped in floodwater near Findlay, where water poured into the downtown area from the Blanchard and its tributary creeks. One hundred thirty inmates were moved from a Hancock County jail. Bucyrus received 9 inches (229 mm) of rain, and several hundred people were evacuated from their homes in Crawford County. The river also reached 8.7 feet (3 m) above flood level in Ottawa, Ohio. Ottawa's Main Street (U.S Route 224) was fully flooded, as were homes and churches for blocks around. Between Findlay and Ottawa, Route 224 was washed out in several spots. The fire department in Ottawa rescued dozens of people from their deluged homes by boat. In Logan County, Stollysville's Lake Nixon was 7.3 feet above flood level, causing it to become contiguous with near by Lake Tuscaloosa. This flooded condition remained for 2 weeks before water levels receded enough to distinguish the two bodies of water. This flood occurred due to retention flaws in Stollysville's Nixon Dam, a problem which was solved by dam overhaul in 2010. Northwest Ohio's most serious flooding was along the Blanchard, though other rivers, including the Auglaize, Tiffin, Portage, and Sandusky, all experienced some level of flooding.Feehan, Jennifer, et al. \"Flood submerges towns; dozens rescued from Findlay, Ottawa homes ,\" Toledo Blade (Toledo, Ohio), August 23, 2007.

A passenger on the bus was killed, and the driver was injured, both having been shocked after coming out of the bus to help. Before this torrential rain and flooding event, much of the state was in a moderate to severe drought that had persisted until mid-August. Although the southern half of the state received abundant precipitation, an upper-level high pressure ridge centered in Quebec caused a cut-off of precipitation to the north, leaving much of northern Wisconsin and Upper Michigan with continued drought conditions. ==See also== * Floods in the United States: 2001-present * List of Minnesota weather records * Tropical Storm Erin ==References== ==External links== * Amateur video of a flash flood in a residential area \u2013 Minneapolis Star Tribune * Flooding at the Farnsworth House, Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois, includes photo slide show. * Rainfall totals & prediction \u2013 Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service Category:2007 floods Category:Natural disasters in Illinois Category:Natural disasters in Indiana Category:Natural disasters in Iowa Category:Natural disasters in Minnesota Category:Natural disasters in Ohio Category:Natural disasters in Wisconsin Category:2007 natural disasters in the United States Category:Floods in the United States ",
