Her infectious music and singing style have a universal appeal and her lyrics carry powerful and poignant messages. Her care-free way of performance included performing bare- foot. In the 1960s, she adopted the artistic name Vickie; only later did she become known by Busi Mhlongo. She was an initiated sangoma, which heavily influenced her music. In the 1970s, Mhlongo relocated to London, later recording with other South African artists who were living in exile, such as Dudu Pukwana, and Julian Bahula. By the 1980s, she performed internationally, performing with other well-renowned artists such as Salif Keita. By the early 1990s, she began releasing her own individual works, with her first album, Barbentu, being released in 1993. A year later, she joined Hugh Masekela's homecoming tour. In 1995, Busi joined Hugh in the Africa 95' in London. In 1998, she released her second album, Urban Zulu, which became a hit in various markets around the world and reportedly spent months in the Billboard World Music charts. She went on to release several more albums, Freedom (2003), and Amakholwa before her death from breast cancer in June 2010.Although physical- self isn't around, her energetic style of performance remains and can be seen through choreographer Somizi Mhlongo. Her music is a symbolism of the struggle for justice in South Africa. Her vocal range is incredible for she was able to go from a soft note to a booming roar. Due to her powerful activism against apartheid through music, Mhlongo was exiled therefore working and living in Netherlands, North America and the U.K. Busi sold half-a-dozen solo albums. Later during her career she became known s \"Mam'Busi\". During her youth, she joined the musical King Kong in Durban and was encouraged to play the drums. Her creativity launched her decision to create her band, Twasa. Her style of performance was inspired by Dorothy Masuka, Miriam Makeba but mostly Princess Magogo. _FAMILY_ Busi Mhlongo married drummer Early Mabuza. They later had a daughter. Due to Busi's exile she was unable to raise her daughter and attend her husbands funeral whose cause of death was murder. Busi was raised in a musically inclined family in the mountain village of Ohlange. _NOMINATIONS_ Busi was nominated for a grammy and won 3 South African Music Awards. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1947 births Category:2010 deaths Category:People from Inanda, KwaZulu-Natal category:Zulu people Category:South African musicians Category:South African female dancers Category:Deaths from cancer in South Africa ",
