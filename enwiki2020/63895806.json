    "text": "MONOWHALES is a three-piece, alt-rock band from Toronto, Ontario, Canada] The band made their debut as a four-piece band in 2017 with their first single \"Take It Back\", produced by Al-P of Mstrkrft, which went on to peak at #25 on the Mediabase Canada Alternative Rock Chart. This was followed by the six-song EP Control Freak on June 1, 2018. After spending the latter half of 2018 touring, the band flew BC-based producer Ryan Worsley to Toronto to record new material. The resulting single \"RWLYD (Really Wanna Let You Down)\" was released on September 13, 2019. Overwhelming support from Canadian alternative rock radio propelled the single to #2 on the Mediabase Canada Alternative Rock Chart, making MONOWHALES the only independent band in Canadian radio history to reach that high on the chart. Between dates on their cross-Canada tour, the band spent two weeks at Echoplant Studios in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia working on a new record with Worsley. Three MONOWHALES songs off 2018's Control Freak were featured in Season 1, Episode 5 of 2020 Netflix series Spinning Out, which also included a cameo appearance by the band. == Members == * Sally Shaar \u2013 lead vocals * Zach Zanardo \u2013 guitar, bass, synthesizer, vocals * Jordan Circosta \u2013 drums, synthesizer, vocals The band parted ways with synth player Holly Jamieson after a 2019 cross-country tour. == Discography == === Studio albums === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! style=\"width:14em;\" |Title ! style=\"width:18em;\" |Details |- ! scope=\"row\" |Control Freak | * Released: June 1, 2018 * Label: TRUE Records * Formats: CD, digital download |} === Singles === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Song |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" |2017 |Take It Back |- | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |2018 |Real Love |- |Let It Go |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" |2019 |RWLYD (Really Wanna Let You Down) |} == Awards and nominations == {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" !Year !Organization !Award !Work or author awarded !Result |- | rowspan=\"1\" |2019 |Canadian Music Week |Jim Beam INDIES Award (Best Alternative Artists or Group of the Year) |MONOWHALES | style=\"background:#90FF90\" |Winner |- |2019 |Forest City London Music Awards |Ontario Indie Recording Artist of the Year |MONOWHALES | style=\"background:#90FF90\" |Winner |} == Charting History == {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |} {| class=\"wikitable\" ! rowspan=\"2\" |Year ! rowspan=\"2\" |Song !Chart Peak ! rowspan=\"2\" |Albums |- ! style=\"width:40px;\" |CAN Alt |- |2017 |\"Take It Back\" | style=\"text-align:center;\" |25 | rowspan=\"3\" |Control Freak |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2018 |\"Real Love\" | style=\"text- align:center;\" |31 |- |\"Let It Go\" | style=\"text-align:center;\" |32 |- |2019 |\"RWLYD (Really Wanna Let You Down)\" | style=\"text-align:center;\" |2 |RWLYD (Really Wanna Let You Down) |} == References == == External links == * Category:Musical groups established in 2017 Category:Musical groups from Toronto Category:2017 establishments in Ontario Category:Canadian alternative rock groups ",
