He attended Ohio University on scholarship and received a BFA and an MFA in Art History with minors in English Literature and Studio Art. For several semesters he studied in Rome, Florence and London. A seminar on Donatello opened his interest in three dimensional forms. His mentor was Marilyn Bradshaw PhD, a Renaissance scholar, but he wrote his thesis on the Modern painter and printmaker, Georges Rouault. After initial teaching assignments and museum work, he enrolled at Indiana University, Bloomington. He completed his PhD under the direction of Bruce Cole, Distinguished Professor and later Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities. His dissertation focused on Pietro Perugino and the foundations of American collecting. == Career == Following a period of teaching at Ohio University as a sabbatical replacement, Becherer moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan.
