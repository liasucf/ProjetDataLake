In 1982, the club joined the London Spartan League, reaching the Premier Division in 1984. In 1988, the club changed name to Southwark Borough, a year after the club entered the FA Vase for the first time. After a ninth-placed finish in the 1988\u201389 Spartan League, Southwark Borough were ejected from the league following breaking misconduct rules. The club folded on 3 April 1990, after a failed attempt to gain admission to the Essex Senior League. ==Ground== The club initially played at Southwark Sports Ground in Dulwich. In 1988, Southwark Borough entered a groundsharing agreement with Fisher Athletic at their Surrey Docks Stadium. The groundshare was terminated at the end of the season, following Southwark's expulsion from the Spartan League. Southwark later secured a pitch in Kidbrooke, before folding due to not having a league to compete in. ==Records== *Best FA Vase performance: First round, 1988\u201389 *Record attendance: 325 vs Fisher Athletic, Spartan League, 3 April 1989 ==References== ==External links== * Category:Defunct football clubs in England Category:Spartan League Category:Association football clubs established in 1975 Category:1975 establishments in England Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 1990 Category:Defunct football clubs in London Category:1990 disestablishments in England Category:Sport in the London Borough of Southwark ",
