They constructed synagogues together,Bava Batra 3b would both give sermons following the shacharit prayer on Shabbat,Brachot 30a and would both rely on someone supporting them to ensure they recited kiddush levana while standing.Sanhedrin 42a He was also friends with Ravina I, and they are mentioned together in many halachic contexts.Nedarim 60b, 90a; etc. Once a man left Maremar's house having received a halachic ruling. Rav Aha b. Raba was outside at the time and asked which ruling he had received. Aha considered the answer to be wrong, so he sent the man back inside to hear the ruling again. When asked again, Maremar gave the same answer, and added an explanation for the benefit of whoever had questioned the original ruling.Chullin 47a Other sages deduced a number of laws from their observations of Maremar's behavior.Pesachim 107a His son, Judah b. Meremar, also became a renowned scholar. ==References== Category:Talmud rabbis of Babylonia ",
