Established in 2019, the company was established following the merger of two of Kakao M's labels, Plan A Entertainment (established in 2011) and FAVE Entertainment (established in 2012). ==History== In 2011, A Cube Entertainment was established as an independent label of Cube Entertainment. In November 2015, LOEN Entertainment (now Kakao M) acquired 70% of the entire label and subsequently absorbed it as an independent subsidiary. The label later changed their name to Plan A Entertainment. In early 2018, Plan A Entertainment acquired Kakao M's actor agency E&T; Story Entertainment, owning 60% of the agency's shares. In the following months, Choi Jin-ho (founder and co-CEO) resigned and 30% of the remaining shares were sold for 3.51 billion won. As a result, it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Kakao M. On February 13, 2019, Kakao M released a statement that Plan A Entertainment and Fave Entertainment would be merging on April 1. Fave Entertainment was originally established as an label of Kakao M in 2012 under name LOEN Tree before the company name was changed to Fave Entertainment in 2016. It was later confirmed the company would be known as Play M Entertainment. ==Artists== Groups * Apink * Victon * Bandage * Weeekly Soloists * Huh Gak * Jung Eun-ji * Lim Ji-min * Oh Ha-young * Han Seung-woo * Kim Nam-joo ==Actors== E&T; Story Entertainment * Kim So- hyun * Park Han-deul * Kim Ye-eun * Go Na-hee * Ahn Soo-min * Shin Hyeon-Seung ==Former artists== * Run * Park Ji-yoon (1997\u20131999) * Gain (2011\u20132013) * Apink ** Hong Yoo-kyung (2011-2013) * Mario (2011\u20132013) * Sunny Hill (2011\u20132017) * Fiestar (2012\u20132018) **Cheska (2012\u20132014) **Jei (2012\u20132018) **Linzy (2012\u20132018) **Hyemi (2012\u20132018) **Yezi (2012\u20132018) **Cao Lu (2012\u20132018) * History (2013\u20132017) ** Song Kyung-il (2013\u20132019) ** Na Do-Kyun (2013\u20132019) ** Kim Shi- hyoung (2013\u20132019) ** Kim Jae-ho (2013\u20132019) ** Jang Yi-jeong (2013\u20132019) * Shin Zisu (2015\u20132016) * I.B.I (2016) * JBJ (2017\u20132018) E&T; Story Entertainment * Jung Soo-hyun ==Discography== ===Projects=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=\"200\" | Title ! width=\"50\" |Year ! width=\"260\" | Artists ! width=\"60\" | Peak Chart Positions ! width=\"200\" | Sales (Download) ! width=\"200\" |Albums |- ! style=\"text-align:left;\" | Love Day | align=\"center\" |2012 | Jung Eun-ji, Yang Yo-seob | align=\"center\" | 8 | * KOR: 1,604,167+Digital sales for Love Day: * |A Cube For Season #Green |- ! style=\"text-align:left;\" | A Year Ago | align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\" |2013 | Jung Eun-ji, Kim Nam-joo, Jang Hyun-seung | align=\"center\" | 13 | * KOR: 300,616+Digital sales for A Year Ago: * |A Cube For Season #White |- ! style=\"text-align:left;\" | Short Hair | Jung Eun-ji, Huh Gak | align=\"center\" | 1 | * KOR: 1,207,766+Digital sales for Short Hair: * |A Cube For Season #Blue |- ! style=\"text-align:left;\" | Break Up To Make Up | align=\"center\" |2014 | Jung Eun-ji, Huh Gak | align=\"center\" | 1 | * KOR: 803,627+Digital sales for Break Up to Make Up: * |A Cube For Season #Sky Blue |- ! style=\"text-align:left;\" | Photograph | align=\"center\" |2015 | Kim Nam-joo, Yook Sung-jae | align=\"center\" | 29 | * KOR: 115,083+Digital sales for Photograph: * |A Cube For Season #Blue Season 2 |- ! style=\"text-align:left;\" | Bada 'Ocean.wav' | align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\" |2016 | Jung Eun-ji, Huh Gak | align=\"center\" | 5 | * KOR: 407,547+Digital sales for Ocean: * * * |Plan A First Episode |- ! style=\"text-align:left;\" | #Begin Again | Huh Gak, Plan A Boys | align=\"center\" | \u2014 | * KOR: 17,447+Digital sales for #Begin Again: * |Plan A Second Episode |- ! style=\"text-align:left;\" |Oasis | align=\"center\" |2017 |Apink, Huh Gak, VICTON | align=\"center\" | 100 | *KOR: 22,488+Digital sales for Oasis: * |Plan A Third Episode |} ==References== ==External links== * *E&T; Website *Play M Entertainment on Naver Post Category:Record labels established in 2011 Category:South Korean record labels Category:Labels distributed by Kakao M Category:Talent agencies of South Korea ",
