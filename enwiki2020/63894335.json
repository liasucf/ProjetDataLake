In the late 1950s he attracted media attention with his denunciation of Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg's A Survivor from Warsaw. == living and work == === Career === Born in Neum\u00fcnster, Schnoor was the son of a student council. After studying musicology in Leipzig with Hugo Riemann and Karl Straube and completing his doctorate in musicology with Arnold Schering,Hans Schnoor: Harmony and Chaos, . Schnoor was initially music editor at the Leipzig Freie Presse. Since January 1922 he was director of the feuilleton and music editor of the Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten, before he changed as an editor to the '. Hans Schnoor: Harmony and Chaos, . In 1926 Schnoor returned to Dresden and was music editor of the Dresdner Anzeiger until 1945 and also lecturer at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik Carl Maria von Weber Dresden. During this time he personally met Richard Strauss and Hans Pfitzner. In addition to his work as a music editor, Schnoor was also active as an author of musicological books from 1919. In 1926 for example he published Musik der germanischen V\u00f6lker im XIX. und XX. Jahrhundert.Musik der germanischen V\u00f6lker im XIX. und XX. Jahrhundert on WorldCat === Nazi era === Schnoor had been a member of the NSDAP since 1 May 1932 (member number 1.131.053).Ernst Klee: Kulturlexikon, and Fred K. Prieberg: Handbuch, After the Seizure of control by the Nazis he also belonged to the German Labour Front and the National Socialist People's Welfare Organization and wrote music criticism in the sense of the Nazi ideology. In April 1933, as chairman of the Dresden chapter of the Militant League for German Culture, he invited various music critics to a conference with papers on opera in the Third Reich.Fred K. Prieberg: Musik im NS-Staat. Fischer Taschenbuch-Verlag 1982, . In the new edition of his concert guide Oratorios and secular choral works he wrote in 1939: \"The new spiritual Germany with its moving thoughts: people and leader, homeland, blood and soil, race, myth, heroic history, ethos of work, community of all creative folk comrades carries within it the old metaphysical longing for artistic idealization of its highest visual goods\".Quoted after Joseph Wulf: Music in the Third Reich. A documentation. Ullstein, Frankfurt/ Berlin / VIenna 1983, , ; as an abbreviated quotation also in Ernst Klee: Kulturlexikon, . That Schnoor was not only a staunch Nazi, but also a fervent anti-Semit, is shown exemplarily by a review of the new edition of the Riemann Musiklexikon by Joseph M\u00fcller-Blattau, who deemed that Schnoor did not go far enough: : \"How strong Riemann's beliefs since 1919, the year of his death, have been bent over with Jewish fixity, of which Alfred Einstein new editions in countless articles displays overwhelming evidence; in many cases the encyclopedia resembled a Jewish temple of fame. Now that the last possible separation between non-Jewish and Jewish in the realm of Adolf Hitler's empire was carried out in the areas of cultural, intellectual and scientific life, one might have expected a correspondingly radical departure from Einstein's editing practice in the new Riemann. But what happened? The whole of Judaism, which had settled into our culture over the past decades, has been given extensive tributes. [...] Thus stands a Herr Adolf Aber as \"DJ\" lies German Jew (!) in the new Riemann. This \"German\" Jew, a former Leipzig critic, now a London music wholesale dealer, is listed with all his \"merits\", even though even the Jewish musicological guild of the System Age had already noticed the lamentability of his publications, for example his Handbuch der Musikliteratur.Handbuch der Musikliteratur on WorldCatOne would have now, after he is listed in the Reich with all his \"merits\", even though this evil scientific impostor was morally destroyed by Alfred Heu\u00df long before 1933 and was only held by a stubborn newspaper publisher for reasons of \"prestige\".Hans Schnoor: Peinliche Ehrenrettung des Riemann \u2013 Deutsche Juden im neuen Musiklexikon, in the Dresdener Anzeiger, 14 March 1939, reprinted in Melos, 23rd year, 1956, September issue, Schnoor wrote for the NS magazine '. === Post-war period === After the Second World War, Schnoor remained in the Soviet occupation zone until 1948 and was able to publish a book there to mark the 400th anniversary of the S\u00e4chsische Staatskapelle Dresden. In 1949 he moved to Bielefeld, where he became a music critic with the '. According to Fred K. Prieberg, Schnoor continued to write reviews \"with anti-Semitic undertones and the vocabulary of Nazi journalism of yesteryear\"Quote by Fred K. Prieberg: Music in the Nazi State. Fischer Taschenbuch, 1982, . The same could be said about several musicological books aimed at a broad audience, most of which Schnoor published at Bertelsmann. In his reference work Oper Operetta Concert, first published in 1955, Schnoor wrote about the Jewish composer Giacomo Meyerbeer that the classical ideals of music and art were foreign to him and that he understood music above all as a business. In doing so, he took up anti-Semitic resentments, which Richard Wagner, Meyerbeer and other Jewish composers had met.Hans Schnoor: Oper, Operette, Konzert. G\u00fctersloh 1964, === 1956 Sch\u00f6nberg scandal === As a critic, Schnoor ignited a media scandal in June 1956, after he had torn Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg's Holocaust melodrama A Survivor from Warsaw in the Westfalen-blatt at a program announcement with the following words: \"that disgusting play, which must be seem like a mockery to every decent German. To complete the measure of the challenging indecency, the conductor of this program, Hermann Scherchen (who else?) is placed next to the hate song of Sch\u00f6nberg Beethoven's music to Goethe's Egmont. How long is this going to go on?\"Monika Boll: Nachtprogramm,[https://www.worldcat.org/title/nachtprogramm-intellektuelle- grundungsdebatten-in-der-fruhen- bundesrepublik/oclc/238182863&referer;=brief_results Nachtprogramm : intellektuelle Gr\u00fcndungsdebatten in der fr\u00fchen Bundesrepublik on WorlddCat , quoted from the Westfalen-blatt dated 16 June 1956. A few days later, Schnoor attended a conference of the Evangelische Akademie f\u00fcr Rundfunk und Fernsehen in in the Taunus region as co-examiner of Winfried Zillig, where the establishment of a cultural programme on radio (\"Third Programme\") was on the agenda. In his lecture on the \"Platz der Neuen Musik\" (New Music Square), Zillig presented the work of his teacher Sch\u00f6nberg and at the end quoted the article by his co-examiner. Zillig refused a discussion with Schnoor and left the hall. When confronted, Schnoor made a half-hearted statement. Only two days later, a four-column article by Walter Dirks about the conference appeared in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, \"Bericht \u00fcber ein Scherbengericht\",The report was also reprinted in the July/August issue of the music magazine Melos, 23rd year, 1956 Bericht \u00fcber ein Scherbengericht , to which Schnoor wrote a counterstatement in the September issue (p. 263), which was replicated by Dirks with the text Scherbengericht Nr. 2 () which dealt exclusively with the Schnoor case. Dirks brought in the article another quote from Schnoor's column \"Wir und der Funk\" (We and the radio) of 29 October 1955, where Schnoor had denounced the alleged tyranny of re-emigrants in German radio stations and concluded: \"Soon we will be able to talk more openly and precisely about all these things. There will be an uprising - not of the masses, but of the best.\"Quote by Monika Boll: Nachtprogramm, . In his rejection of New Music, Dirks accused Schnoor of \"anti-Semitic nationalism\" and National Socialist ideas, coupled with the question of whether this would violate existing laws.Monika Boll: Nachtprogramm, . After Theodor W. Adorno had also joined the debate, further details became known. Schnoor, for example, had described Adorno in several critiques as the cause of the \"Frankfurt poisoning\" of the Westdeutscher Rundfunk and had called him \"Wiesengrund\" with his discarded name.Monika Boll: Nachtprogramm, : \"apostrophized exclusively with his Jewish name\". After the musicologist Fred K. Prieberg among other things accused him in a polemical broadcast on S\u00fcdwestfunk Baden-Baden of \"National Socialist music criticism\",Fred K. Prieberg: Music in the NS State, . Prieberg does not call himself by name, but describes himself as \"an employee of the S\u00fcdwestfunk\". Schnoor, supported by his publisher Hermann Stumpf, filed a private lawsuit. This lawsuit was dismissed in the first instance on the grounds that Schnoor had to put up with \"that his crude attacks are answered in the same way\".Fred K. Prieberg: Music in the NS State, as well as notes . An appeal by Schnoor in the next instance was again rejected. At the court ruling, Prieberg was granted the right to freedom of expression according to \u00a7 193 StGB and the assertion in Prieberg's S\u00fcdwestfunk broadcast that Schnoor's style was reminiscent of the expressions of \"Das Schwarze Korps\" was confirmed as a statement of fact.Monika Boll: Nachtprogramm, In 1958 Schnoor retired as editor,Fred K. Prieberg: Handbuch, . but continued to write music-historical works. In early 1962 he published the partly autobiographical book Harmony and Chaos. Musik der Gegenwart, in which he made no secret of his aversion to New Music and, among others, tore Stravinsky to pieces, but instead identified Richard Strauss and Hans Pfitzner as the most important composers of the 20th century.Josef M\u00fcller-Marein: Music has nothing to do with politics. in Die Zeit, Nr. 4/1962. Recension. He described the Sch\u00f6nberg scandal of 1956 as a \"wave of reputation-killing actions\" against his person.Hans Schnoor: Harmonie und Chaos, , quote .
