    "text": "Aaron Cameron (born 27 January 2000) is an Australian racing driver, competing in the TCR Australia Series in the No. 18 Peugeot 308 TCR for Team Valvoline GRM. == Early career == Aaron Cameron driving in the 2019 Hi-Tec Oils Bathurst 6 Hour. He finished first in his class. Cameron's racing career began in karting in his home state of Victoria, with his breakthrough season coming aged 14 in 2014, as he won various state-level junior titles. In 2015, as well as moving up to the national level, he competed in selected races in Europe, including the Rotax Max Challenge Grand Finals and the KF-Junior category of the Karting World Championship. Cameron made his first step out of karts in 2016, competing in the Victorian Formula Ford Championship, where he finished third, and two rounds of the 2016 Australian Formula Ford Championship. 2017 saw Cameron race in several grassroots and amateur categories in addition to Formula Ford and karts, including the Toyota 86 Racing Series, the V8 Ute Racing Series, the Keema Cars Excel Cup (a one-make competition for the Hyundai Excel X3), and a one-make endurance race for the Holden HQ Kingswood. In 2018, Cameron won the KZ2 title in the Australian Kart Championship, driving for James Courtney's team, JC Kart. He also competed in the 2018 SuperUtes Series, finishing fifth overall. == Touring car career == Cameron made his TCR debut in the 2018 24 Hours of Barcelona, one of five drivers for MARC Cars Australia in the No. 138 Audi RS 3 LMS TCR. However, the team was forced to retire nine hours into the race, and as they had not completed 60% of the total distance, they were not classified in the final results. On 16 May 2019, Cameron was announced as the driver of the No. 2 Volkswagen Golf GTI TCR for Melbourne Performance Centre in the inaugural season of the TCR Australia Series. He won his first race in the series in the final round, achieving victory in the penultimate race at The Bend Motorsport Park. He finished the season in third place, behind Will Brown in first and Tony D'Alberto in second. For the 2020 season, Cameron was signed by Garry Rogers Motorsport to drive a Peugeot 308 TCR under the banner of Team Valvoline GRM. == Career results == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" !Season !Series !Position !Car !Team |- ! rowspan=\"4\" |2016 | Australian Kart Championship - KZ2 | align=\"center\" |5th | | |- | Victorian Formula Ford Championship | align=\"center\" |3rd | Spectrum 014 | Borland Racing Developments |- | Australian Formula Ford Series | align=\"center\" |18th | Spectrum 014 | |- | Heritage Touring Cars - Group C | align=\"center\" |24th | Isuzu Gemini PF50 | |- ! rowspan=\"7\" |2017 | Australian Kart Championship - KZ2 | align=\"center\" |4th | JC Kart | JC Kart |- | Victorian Formula Ford Championship | align=\"center\" |23rd | Spectrum 014 | |- | Australian Formula Ford Series | align=\"center\" |15th | Spectrum 014 | |- | Australian V8 Ute Racing Series | align=\"center\" |17th | Ford FG Falcon XR8 Ute | Peters Motorsport |- | Australian GT Trophy Series - MARC class | align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffffbf\" |1st | Ford LZ Focus V8 | MARC Cars Australia |- | Keema Cars Excel Cup | align=\"center\" |22nd | Hyundai Excel X3 | |- | Toyota 86 Racing Series | align=\"center\" |21st | Toyota 86 | |- ! rowspan=\"5\" |2018 | Australian Kart Championship - KZ2 | align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffffbf\" |1st | JC Kart | JC Kart |- | ECB SuperUtes Series | align=\"center\" |5th | Mazda BT-50 | Peters Motorsport |- | Heritage Touring Cars - Group C | align=\"center\" |20th | Holden LX Torana SS5000 A9X | |- | Toyota 86 Racing Series | align=\"center\" |43rd | Toyota 86 | |- | Australian Production Car Series | align=\"center\" |60th | Toyota 86 | |- ! rowspan=\"3\" |2019 | carsales TCR Australia Series | align=\"center\" style=\"background: #FFDF9F;\"| 3rd | Volkswagen Golf GTI TCR | Melbourne Performance Centre |- | Heritage Touring Cars - Group C | align=\"center\" |5th | Holden LX Torana SS5000 A9X | |- | MRF Tyres Australian Production Car Series | align=\"center\" |19th | Toyota 86 | Aaron Cameron Racing |- !colspan=\"5\"| |} == References == == External links == * Category:2000 births Category:Living people Category:Racing drivers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Formula Ford drivers ",
