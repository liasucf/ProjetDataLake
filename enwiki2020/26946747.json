A segment on the show featured Maurice and his toast work. In a conversation with Cain, Maurice talked about what initially inspired him to take up toast as an artistic medium, his method of work, and how he has been stimulated by Pacific motifs.

He used 2989 slices of Wonder white bread, toasted, to create an image of the international female impersonator Dame Edna Everage.

The work was on display for five weeks, at the end of which the sponsor spoke of donating it to the Melbourne Museum.
