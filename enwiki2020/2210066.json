    "text": "Khark Island () is a continental island in the Persian Gulf belonging to Iran. The island is located off the coast of Iran and northwest of the Strait of Hormuz. Administered by the adjacent coastal Bushehr Province, Khark Island provides a sea port for the export of oil and extends Iranian territorial sea claims into the Persian Gulf oil fields. Located on Khark Island is Khark, the only city in the Khark District. ==History== , the Khark oil terminal handles about 98% of Iran's crude exports. Mentioned in the Hudud al-'Alam as a good source for pearls around 982 AD, Khark was visited by Jean de Th\u00e9venot in 1665, who recorded trade at the time with Isfahan and Basra. In 1753 the Dutch Empire established both a trading post and a fort on the island after securing perpetual ownership of the island from Mir Nas\u00e1ir, the Arab ruler of Bandar Rig, in return for a present of 2000 rupees.J. R. Perry, \"The Banu Ka'b: An amphibious brigand state in Khuzistan,\" Le monde iranien et l'Islam 1, 1971, pp. 131-52. Idem, \"Mir Muhanna and the Dutch: Patterns of piracy in the Persian Gulf,\" Stud. Ir. 2, 1973, p85. In 1766 the Dutch fort was captured by Mir Mahanna, the governor of Bandar Rig. The island was briefly occupied in 1838 by the British to block the Siege of Herat (1838) but was soon returned. Amoco built and operated the oil terminal on the island. Its property was expropriated after the revolution. Kharg beach in 1970 Once the world's largest offshore crude oil terminal and the principal sea terminal for Iranian oil, the Khark Island facilities were put out of commission in the fall of 1986. Heavy bombing of the Khark Island facilities from 1980 through 1988 by the Iraqi Air Force during the Iran\u2013Iraq War all but destroyed most of the terminal facilities. Khark Island was situated in the middle of the Darius Oilfield, also destroyed by the intensive bombing. Repair to all facilities has been very slow, even after the war ended in 1988. The events experienced by this island gave rise to the dispute in the English contract law case The Kanchenjunga [1990] 1 Lloyd's Rep 391, regarding the conditions for repudiatory breach of contract and a claimant's right to elect to accept repudiation. In 2009, Iran exported and swapped 950 million barrels of crude oil via southern Khark oil terminal. ==Archaeology== The first archaeological evidence of human occupation on Khark island was reported by Captain A. W. Stiffe in 1898, with studies published about his discoveries by F. Sarre and E. Herzfeld in 1910. They discovered two rock-cut chambered tombs featuring arched entranceways to a main chamber with vestibule from which spawned around twenty smaller chambers. The southern tomb is deep and features a relief of a reclining man drinking in the Seleucid and Parthian styles of Palmyra along with a damaged relief suggested to feature Nike on the face of a sphere-topped column. Mary-Joseph Steve has argued that the architecture of the tombs is more reminiscent of Nabataean architecture at Petra than anything Palmyrene.Stiffe, Captain A. W., \"Persian Gulf notes. Kharag island,\" Geographical Journal 12, 1898, pp. 179-82. Sykes, P.M., A History of Persia, vol. 2, London, 1915.F. Sarre and E. Herzfeld, Iranische Felsreliefs, Berlin, 1910.Steve, M.-J., \"Sur l'\u00eele de Kh\u00e2rg dans le golfe Persique,\" Dossiers d'Arche\u201aologie 243, pp. 74-80, 1999.Steve, M.-J., et al.

Handbuch des Persischen Golfs, 5th ed., Hamburg, Deutsches Hydrographisches Institut, 1976. Another eighty three rock cut tombs and sixty two megalithic tombs have been studied on Kharg. The rock-cut tombs fall into four categories; single chambered, shallow tombs of varying shape, pit burials and excavated multi-chambered complexes. Steve also noticed the presence of several Nestorian style crosses at some of the tombs. There are also ruins of a coarse stone temple on the island measuring around square with a plastered altar for fire in the centre. A Christian church complex or ancient monastery of some by is also located on the island featuring a chapel, nineteen monks cells, library and courtyard. === Achaemenid inscription === On November 14, 2007, a cuneiform inscription dating back to Achaemenid era was discovered on Kharg Island in Old Persian. The inscription is carved on a coral rock in Old Persian semi-syllabic cuneiform signs. Despite the usually well-ordered regular system of Achaemenid inscriptions, this one is in an unusual order written in five lines. On May 31, 2008, the inscription was seriously damaged by unknown vandal(s). They destroyed it with a sharp object, such that about 70 percent of the inscription was seriously damaged. The nature of the damage indicates that it was done deliberately. Jean de Th\u00e9venot noted the presences of qanats on the island that would have provided ancient irrigation. == In popular culture == The island appears with a SAM radar installation on it in the Sega Genesis flight simulator F-15 Strike Eagle II in the Persian Gulf mission map. The island is featured as a playable map in DICE's Battlefield 3 video game, having some resemblance to the real island. It also appears in Delta Force: Black Hawk Down \u2013 Team Sabre. == See also == * List of lighthouses in Iran ==References== Category:Megalithic monuments in the Middle East Category:Islands of Iran Category:Bushehr County Category:Islands of the Persian Gulf Category:Archaeological sites in Iran Category:Landforms of Bushehr Province ",
