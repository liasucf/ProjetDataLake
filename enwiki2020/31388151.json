Their northern extension approached Sandy Creek, while they were also present south- east at the head of Cooper's Creek and part of the King River. In Norman Tindale's scheme, the Kunwinjku were allotted a tribal territory of around in the area south of Jungle Creek and on the headwaters of the East Alligator River. The Gumader swamps near Junction Bay and the creeks east of Oenpelli/Awunbelenja (now Gunbalanya) also formed part of their land. ==Alternative names== * Kunwinjku (now considered the standard spelling) * Gunwingu * Gunwingo * Wengi, Wengei, Wengej * Gundeidjeme * Gundjeipmi * Kulunglutji, Kulunglutchi * Gundjeibmi, Gundjajeimi, Gundeijeme, Gundeidjeme * Margulitban * Unigangk, Urnigangg. * Koorungo * Neinggu/Nei\u014bgu.
