    "text": "The Snack Wrap is a menu item available at McDonald's in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. It consists of 100% white meat chicken breast (crispy or grilled), lettuce, shredded cheddar jack cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, and sauce (ranch, honey mustard or salsa roja), wrapped in a soft flour tortilla. It was created to serve as a snack to satisfy hunger between meals. It was officially launched in the United States in 2006, and was initially only available with crispy chicken and ranch sauce. In early 2007, the option to substitute for grilled chicken and/or honey mustard sauce were made available. In some markets, salsa roja or Chipolte BBQ is also available. The Snack Wrap was developed as an attempt to create a new chicken item appealing to drive-through customers. The original wrap used the same meat as the Chicken Selects, allowing restaurants to cook batches of the chicken more frequently and provide a fresher product to customers. The menu item was also introduced in order to take advantage of the growing demand for \"snack-size\", or smaller portion options. ==Nutrition information== A Snack Wrap with crispy chicken and ranch sauce contains 330 calories (1,380 kJ), 16 grams of fat, 2 grams of trans fat, 35 milligrams of cholesterol, 780 milligrams of sodium, 33 grams of carbohydrates, and 14 grams of protein.
