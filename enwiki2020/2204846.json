    "text": "Francesco Moser ( or ; ; Dizionario d'ortografia e di pronunzia born 19 June 1951 in Pal\u00f9 di Giovo, Trentino), nicknamed \"Lo sceriffo\" (The sheriff), is an Italian former professional road bicycle racer. Moser was dominant from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s and won the 1984 Giro d'Italia, the 1977 world road racing championship and six times in three of the five monuments. He turned professional in 1973, showing a cultured pedaling style. But his powerful build meant he was not a gifted climber. His 273 road victories puts him behind Eddy Merckx (525) and Rik Van Looy (379), but ahead of Rik Van Steenbergen (270) and Roger De Vlaeminck (255). He was also an accomplished track rider, riding up to six Six-Day races almost each winter throughout his career. He rode 35, 14 of which with Ren\u00e9 Pijnen, winning 15. A nephew, Moreno Moser, (born 25 December 1990) is an Italian professional racer, and Francesco's son Ignazio Moser enjoyed success at the junior and amateur levels before retiring at the age of 22. ==Palmar\u00e8s== ===Classic races=== After finishing second in 1974 behind Roger De Vlaeminck and in 1976 behind Marc Demeyer of Belgium, Moser finally won Paris\u2013Roubaix, his favorite race, three consecutive times. Moser had seven podium finishes in Paris\u2013Roubaix; only De Vlaeminck, with nine, has more. In 1978, he beat De Vlaeminck and Jan Raas of the Netherlands; in 1979, he beat De Vlaeminck and Hennie Kuiper of the Netherlands; and in 1980, he beat Gilbert Duclos-Lassalle of France and the German, Dietrich Thurau. Moser came in third in 1981 behind Bernard Hinault and Roger De Vlaeminck, and was also third in 1983 behind Hennie Kuiper and Gilbert Duclos-Lassalle. He rode Paris\u2013Roubaix in his final season as a cyclist in 1987. Other victories include the 1975 and 1978 Giro di Lombardia and the 1984 Milan\u2013San Remo. ===Other classics=== Moser won the 1974 Paris\u2013Tours, the 1977 Z\u00fcri-Metzgete, the 1979 Gent\u2013Wevelgem, and the 1977 Fl\u00e8che Wallonne. ===Grand Tours=== Moser had some success in the three-week grand tours. He rode the Tour de France in 1975, and although he won two stages, led the race for seven days and won the young rider competition, he never rode the Tour again; the mountains did not suit him. However, he won the 1984 Giro d'Italia, in front of Laurent Fignon of France and Moreno Argentin of Italy. Taking advantage of an unusually flat course, Moser used time- trialing ability to overcome what others had gained in the mountains. He also won the points classification in the Giro d'Italia in 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1982. ==Other accomplishments== He competed in the individual road race and team time trial events at the 1972 Summer Olympics. Moser won the 1977 world road racing championship in San Cristobal, Venezuela, in front of Thurau and Franco Bitossi. Moser was also silver medallist in 1976, behind Freddy Maertens of Belgium and second in 1978 to Gerrie Knetemann of the Netherlands. On 19 January 1984, in Mexico City, Moser broke the 1972 hour record of Eddy Merckx. He rode 50.808 kilometers, on an aerodynamic bike with full disc wheels more advanced than the conventional bike Merckx used in 1972. As a result, in 1997 the Union Cycliste Internationale banned hour records set on bikes featuring technological advantages. Under the new rules, Merckx's record wasn't broken until 2000. Moser auctioned his bicycle to benefit UNICEF. He was a member of the Regional Council of Trentino-Alto Adige from 1993 until 1998.https://www.consiglio.provincia.tn.it/istituzione/storia-del- consiglio/le-legislature/Pages/undicesima-1993-1998.aspx ==Rivalries== Moser's biggest rival was Giuseppe Saronni. ==After retirement== Moser started a bike company, Moser Cicli, constructing race bikes in a workshop in Trento. Production is 2,000-3,000 frames annually. He was the first chairman of the CPA (Cyclistes Professionels Associ\u00e9s), a union for professional riders of TT/I and TT/II league of teams (now UCI WorldTeams and UCI Professional Continental Teams, respectively). He held the position from 1999 until 2007. Moser also became a viticulturist, cultivating different varieties of grapes. He continued his father's winery with his children Francesca, Carlo and Ignazio on the family estate Maso Villa Warth in Val di Cembra, on the hills just north of Trento. He is also a passionate hunter and was the host of the television series \"A Caccia con Moser\" (Hunting with Moser) on Sky Italia's channel Caccia TV. ==Major results== ;1971 : 1st 20px Overall Giro Ciclistico d'Italia ::1st Stages 1a & 6 ;1972 : 3rd Gran Premio della Liberazione ;1973 : 1st Stage 14 Giro d'Italia : 3rd Giro della Provincia di Reggio Calabria : 7th Trofeo Laigueglia : 9th Overall Tirreno\u2013Adriatico : 9th La Fl\u00e8che Wallonne ;1974 : 1st 20px Overall Cronostaffetta ::1st Stage 1c (ITT) : 1st Paris\u2013Tours : 1st Coppa Bernocchi : 1st Giro del Piemonte : 1st Giro dell'Emilia : 1st Giro della Provincia di Reggio Calabria : 1st Giro Di Toscana : 1st Giro dell'Umbria : 1st GP Forli : 1st Trofeo Baracchi (with Roy Schuiten) : 2nd Paris\u2013Roubaix : 2nd Coppa Placci : 2nd Gran Premio di Lugano : 2nd Trofeo Matteotti : 2nd Grand Prix de Valence : 3rd GP Montelupo : 5th Overall Tirreno\u2013Adriatico : 7th Overall Giro d'Italia : 7th Road race, UCI Road World Championships : 8th Overall Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana : 10th Paris\u2013Brussels ;1975 : 1st 20px Road race, National Road Championships : 1st 20px Overall Grand Prix du Midi Libre ::1st Stages 3 & 4a : 1st Giro di Lombardia : 1st Trofeo Matteotti : 1st Gran Premio Citt\u00e0 di Camaiore : 1st Coppa Placci : 1st Giro dell'Umbria : 1st GP Monaco : 1st Trofeo Baracchi (with Gianbattista Baronchelli) : 2nd Overall Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 : 2nd Milan\u2013San Remo : 2nd Trofeo Pantalica : 2nd Gran Premio di Lugano : 2nd Giro della Provincia di Reggio Calabria : 3rd Z\u00fcri\u2013Metzgete : 4th Overall Tirreno\u2013Adriatico : 5th Paris\u2013Roubaix : 7th Overall Tour de France ::1st Prologue & Stage 7 ::Held 20px after Prologue\u2013Stage 5 : 8th Gent\u2013Wevelgem ;1976 : 1st 20px Individual pursuit, UCI Track World Championships : 1st 20px Overall Giro di Puglia ::1st Stage 2 : 1st Giro dell'Appennino : 1st Giro Di Toscana : 1st Trofeo Pantalica : 1st Trofeo Matteotti : 1st Tre Valli Varesine : 2nd 15px Road race, UCI Road World Championships : 2nd Road race, National Road Championships : 2nd Paris\u2013Roubaix : 2nd Tour of Flanders : 2nd Coppa Bernocchi : 2nd Coppa Placci : 2nd Trofeo Baracchi (with Roy Schuiten) : 3rd Coppa Ugo Agostoni : 3rd Giro del Friuli : 4th Overall Giro d'Italia ::1st 20px Points classification ::1st Stages 4, 7 (ITT) & 14 : 4th Overall Tirreno\u2013Adriatico : 4th Z\u00fcri\u2013Metzgete : 7th Gent\u2013Wevelgem ;1977 : 1st 20px Road race, UCI Road World Championships : 1st La Fl\u00e8che Wallonne : 1st Z\u00fcri\u2013Metzgete : 1st Ch\u00e2teauroux Classic : 1st Grand Prix Le T\u00e9l\u00e9gramme : 1st Crit\u00e9rium des As : 1st Coppa Agostoni : 1st Giro del Lazio : 1st Giro Di Toscana : 1st Giro dell'Umbria : 1st Stage 4 Tour de l'Aude : 2nd Overall Giro d'Italia ::1st 20px Points classification ::Held 20px after Stages 5\u201314 : 3rd Road race, National Road Championships : 3rd Giro di Campania : 4th Tour of Flanders : 5th Milano\u2013Torino : 6th Gran Premio Citt\u00e0 di Camaiore : 7th Amstel Gold Race : 8th Tre Valli Varesine ;1978 : 1st 20px Overall Volta a Catalunya ::1st Prologue, Stages 1, 3b and 7b (ITT) : 1st 20px Overall Tour de l'Aude ::1st Prologue & Stage 1 : 1st Paris\u2013Roubaix : 1st Giro di Lombardia : 1st Tre Valli Varesine : 1st GP Industria & Artigianato di Larciano : 1st Giro del Lazio : 1st Coppa Sabatini : 1st Trofeo Matteotti : 1st Stage 2 Giro di Sardegna : 2nd Overall Giro di Puglia : 2nd 15px Road race, UCI Road World Championships : 2nd Road race, National Road Championships : 2nd Amstel Gold Race : 2nd Z\u00fcri\u2013Metzgete : 2nd Gran Premio di Lugano : 2nd Grand Prix des Nations : 3rd Overall Giro d'Italia ::1st 20px Points classification ::1st Stages 11b, 13, 14 (ITT) & 16 (ITT) : 3rd Overall Tirreno\u2013Adriatico : 3rd Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge : 3rd Gent\u2013Wevelgem : 3rd Trofeo Laigueglia : 3rd Grand Prix of Aargau Canton : 4th Rund um den Henninger Turm : 6th Milan\u2013San Remo : 7th Tour of Flanders : 9th Overall Grand Prix du Midi Libre ::1st Prologue & Stage 3 ;1979 : 1st 20px Road race, National Road Championships : 1st 20px Overall Ruota d'Oro ::1st Stages 2 & 3 : 1st 20px Overall Tour de l'Aude ::1st Prologue : 1st Paris\u2013Roubaix : 1st Gent\u2013Wevelgem : 1st Giro dell'Emilia : 1st Giro del Friuli : 1st Giro del Veneto : 1st Giro Gatteo a Mare : 1st Trofeo Baracchi (with Giuseppe Saronni) : 2nd Overall Giro d'Italia ::1st Prologue, Stages 3 (ITT) & 17 ::Held 20px after Prologue\u2013Stage 7 ::Held 20px after Prologue, Stages 2\u20135, 15 & 17\u201318 : 2nd Overall Giro del Trentino : 2nd Grand Prix des Nations : 2nd Z\u00fcri\u2013Metzgete : 2nd GP Industria & Artigianato di Larciano : 2nd Coppa Ugo Agostoni : 2nd T.I.
