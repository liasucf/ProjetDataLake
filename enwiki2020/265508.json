Lewis and the American writer Joy Gresham. ==Synopsis== The story follows Lewis as he meets an American fan, Joy Gresham, whom he befriends and eventually marries. The story also deals with his struggle with personal pain and grief: Lewis preaches that one should endure suffering with patience, but finds that the simple answers he had preached no longer apply when Joy becomes afflicted with cancer and eventually dies. ==Historical casting== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"80%\" !
