Bevan Hannah from The Canberra Times described it as \"high energy\" and \"very catchy\". Swedish newspaper Expressen stated that the song is \"great\".Expressen. 16 March 1990.

Retrieved 28 March 2020. Music Week stated in their review of the 1992 version, that it is \"sounding fashionably retro\". Johnny Dee from Smash Hits gave the song 5 out of 5, commenting, \"A Technicolor disco wonderland of a record that'll make the charts a sunnier place if it's a hit. Above all, Sweden's most excellent pop tarts are totally top because they look like cartoon characters, realise pop music's a funny old thing and want the whole world to join their \"love train.\" Tom Maurstad from Spartanburg Herald-Journal wrote that \"there is a giddy extravangance to the way the group parades its sources and influences\" and noted \"the Donna Summer's-Last Dance-meets-the-O'Jays-Love Train pulsations\" of \"Ride the Bullet\". ==Chart performance== \"Ride the Bullet\" was a major hit on the charts in Europe.
