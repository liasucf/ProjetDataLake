The most common size is 20\" followed by 18\", but larger examples exist. A flat ride cymbal produces the tightest, driest, most controlled stick sound of all ride cymbals, but with an airy wash. The lack of bell makes this cymbal quieterhttp://www.paiste.com/e/cymbals.php?category=1&family;=26&action;=category&menuid;=342 retrieved 3 March 2012: A very sensitive cymbal perfectly suited for soft playing at lower volume level and studio application.http://zildjian.com/Products/Drumset-Cymbals/Cast-Bronze- Cymbals/K-Zildjian-Series/20-K-Light-Flat-Ride retrieved 3 March 2012: ...a cymbal that you can go to when the music gets softer. and most suitable for jazz. Roy Haynes was one of the first drummers to use a flat ride which can be heard on Chick Corea's album Now He Sings, Now He Sobs made in 1968. ==Examples== * Meinl Byzance 20\" Jazz Flat Ride http://meinlcymbals.com/products/?tx_twmeinlcymbals_products%5Bmode%5D=SERIES&tx;_twmeinlcymbals_products%5BnavId%5D=2&tx;_twmeinlcymbals_products%5Bproduct%5D=181&cHash;=2a92681c85ea1dddcbfcf0731ed12b83 retrieved 4 March 2012: A clear, sweet ping with a subtle hum, little build-up and a long sustain.
