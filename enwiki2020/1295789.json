    "text": "Activists from Christian Aid lobbying for trade justice Christian Aid is the official relief and development agency of 41 Christian (Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox) churches in the UK and Ireland, and works to support sustainable development, eradicate poverty, support civil society and provide disaster relief in South America, the Caribbean, Africa and Asia. It works with hundreds of local partner organisations in some of the world's most vulnerable communities in 37 countries. It is a founder member of the Disasters Emergency Committee, and a major member of the Stop Climate Chaos, The Fairtrade Foundation and Trade Justice Movement campaigns. Christian Aid's headquarters are in London and it has regional teams across the UK and Ireland, plus country offices elsewhere around the world. Christian Aid also organises the UK's largest door-to-door collection, Christian Aid Week, which takes place in May each year. Its director was Loretta Minghella who was appointed in 2010 but resigned in 2017 to work for the Church Commissioners. She was succeeded by the current Chief Executive Officer Amanda Khozi Mukwashi The 2012\u20132013 income of Christian Aid was \u00a395.4 million. Development projects Reconstruction after various wars in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were major projects, alongside the aid given after the overthrow of dictators Idi Amin in Uganda, Somoza family in Nicaragua, and Pol Pot in Cambodia. Yanomami Indians in Brazil were also supported, in a commitment to marginalized peoples. ==Fundraising== Christian Aid raises income from a wide number of sources, such as institutional grants, regular gifts, Christian Aid Week campaign, general donations, legacies, and emergency appeals. In 2013, the institutional income, part of which comes from the Department for International Development and the European Commission, constituted 41% of the total income. A significant percentage of the remaining income comes from thousands of individuals in churches and communities. The main fundraising moments include Christmas, Lent, Easter, Harvest, and Christian Aid Week. In 2013, \u00a312.6 million (or 13% of the total income) were raised during this week. Throughout the year supporters give regularly using direct debit, cash donations, and Will Aid. Churches and community groups also take part in the annual calendar of events (e.g., walks, soup lunches, and quizzes). ==Criticism== Canadian professor Peter Hallward, in his book Damming the Flood, accused Christian Aid of supporting US led violent regime change in Haiti in 2004.Peter Hallward, Damming the Flood (Verso, London, 2008). The development economist Paul Collier in his book The Bottom Billion suggests that Christian Aid \"deeply misinformed\" the UK electorate in 2004 and 2005 with a campaign against reducing trade barriers in Africa based on a \"deeply misleading\" study conducted by an economist without the requisite expertise and whose purported review \"by a panel of academic experts\" who were two people chosen by said economist who were also \"not noted for their expertise on international trade\". He quotes an unnamed official at the British Department of Trade and Industry as saying \"they know it's crap, but it sells the T-shirts\".Paul Collier, The Bottom Billion, pp. 157\u2013159 The organization faced criticism from Israeli academic Gerald M. Steinberg in 2005. He wrote for The Jewish News that several of Christian Aid's campaigns, such as a Christmas appeal called 'Child of Bethlehem' focusing on an injured seven-year-old Palestinian child, unfairly presented the complex Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict through a religiously-charged, exclusionary Christian lens. He argued, \"Victims of the bitter Arab\u2013Israeli conflict are found on both sides... [y]et Christian Aid... chooses consistently to emphasize only one side\". Several of the Britain\u2019s leading foreign aid charities, including Christian Aid, British Red Cross, Save the Children, and Oxfam, have been criticized for paying excessive salaries to some of their managers. In 2013, Christian Aid's CEO was paid \u00a3126,206 and four other staff members were paid between \u00a380,000 and \u00a390,000. Christian Aid's response to this was: \"We want to reassure you that we make every effort to avoid paying higher salaries than are necessary. We pay our staff salaries the same as, or below, the median of other church-based and/or international development agencies.\" ==See also== *Stop Climate Chaos *'Trade Justice' campaigns ==References== ==External links== * Christian Aid official web site * Surefish, Christian community and ethical living * Present Aid, Ethical gifts * The papers of Christian Aid are held at SOAS Archives Category:Christian charities based in the United Kingdom Category:International charities Category:Organisations based in the London Borough of Lambeth Category:Religious action on climate change Category:Religion in the London Borough of Lambeth Category:1945 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Organizations established in 1945 ",
