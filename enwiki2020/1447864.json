Or, the reception method (B-CAS method) that this company offers. All ISDB receiving apparatus such as DTT TV, tuner, and DVD recorder except 1seg-only devices require a B-CAS card under regulation and B-CAS cards are supplied with most units at purchase. B-CAS cards cannot be purchased separately. Implementations of ISDB-T and ISDB-T International (SBTVD) outside Japan do not use the B-CAS system at all as they do not employ the Copy-Once encryption method used on ISDB broadcasts in Japan. For these countries, some operators may choose to implement their own copy protection system. == Gallery == File:B-CAS CARD 1.JPG|BS Digital use B-CAS card File:B-CAS CARD 2.JPG|BS Digital CCI and Terrestrial Digital support mark B-CAS card File:B-CAS CARD 3.JPG|BS/110\u00b0 CS/Terrestrial digital shared use B-CAS card File:B-CAS ORANGE.JPG|CATV exclusive use B-CAS card File:B-CAS BLUE.JPG|Terrestrial Digital exclusive use B-CAS card File:B-CAS CARD WHITE & BLUE.JPG|Terrestrial Digital exclusive use (Special internal use) B-CAS card File:B-CAS\u5e97\u982d\u7528.jpg|Shop use B-CAS card File:B-CAS YELLOW.JPG|Pay broadcast demo use B-CAS card File:B-CAS CARD BLACK.JPG|Business use B-CAS card File:B-CAS CARD mini BLUE.JPG|Terrestrial Digital mini B-CAS card File:B-CAS_CARD_Mini_YELLOW.JPG|Limited use mini B-CAS card ==See also== *Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting ==External links== * Company website Category:ISDB Category:Technology companies of Japan ",
