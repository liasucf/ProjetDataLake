Since Reaume Brothers Racing didn't have a backup truck, Iwuji withdrew from the race and let Johnson drive his (previously No. 08) truck in the race. . \u2013 Playoffs driver ==Race== ===Summary=== Christian Eckes started on pole. Grant Enfinger's truck began smoking due to an oil leak near the beginning of the race, ultimately ending his race and championship hopes. Stewart Friesen also had a problem as it appeared he lost a cylinder during Stage 1. Repairs to the truck put him two laps down. Ross Chastain took the lead from Eckes early on and won Stage 1. In Stage 2, a bizarre occurrence saw Johnny Sauter and Matt Crafton's trucks begin emitting fire simultaneously while they were on the same straightaway, sending them both to the garage. Crafton retired from the race, but Sauter later returned to the track. His truck started smoking shortly afterwards, ending his day for good. Afterwards, Ben Rhodes was the only ThorSport Racing driver whose truck's engine hadn't failed. Chastain continued his lead and won Stage 2. In the closing laps, Austin Hill stayed out while rest of the field pitted, but he pitted during the final caution for tires. Hill made up lost track position, hunting down Chastain and taking the lead with 12 laps remaining. He remained ahead of Chastain and won the race. With Enfinger's playoff hopes already gone, Tyler Ankrum (who entered the race below the cutoff line) barely topped Sauter for the sixth and final spot due to his 11th-place finish, eliminating Sauter from the playoffs. ===Stage Results=== Stage One Laps: 30 {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:98% |- !
