    "text": "Eritrean nationalism is centered on the notion that the Eritreans share a common history, and as such constitute a nation unto themselves. A notional basis for Eritrean nationalism initially seems lacking, due to the divergence in its demographics. Eritrea has nine major ethnic groups, each with their own language and culture and is evenly split between two major religions. However the Eritrean government seeks to foster Eritrean nationalism through programs such as national service programs, the promotion of liberal nationalism and curbing foreign influences.Sorenson, John. \"Discourses on Eritrean nationalism and identity.\" The Journal of Modern African Studies 29.2 (1991): 301-317. ==Symbols== Symbols that have been associated with Eritrean nationalism include the emblem of Eritrea, the anthem Ertra, Ertra, Ertra, and the Flag of Eritrea. Movements that have been associated with Eritrean nationalism include the Eritrean Liberation Front, Eritrean People's Liberation Front and People's Front for Democracy and Justice. People that are often associated with Eritrean nationalism include Woldeab Woldemariam and Ibrahim Sultan. ==See also== *Pan-nationalism *Ethnic nationalism ==References== Category:Ethnic conflict Category:Ethnicity in politics Category:Ethnocentrism Category:Political theories Category:Politics and race ",
