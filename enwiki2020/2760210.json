    "text": "Vladimir Alexandrovich Antonov-Ovseyenko (; ; 9 March 1883 \u2013 10 February 1938), real surname Ovseyenko, party aliases the 'Bayonet' (\u0428\u0442\u044b\u043a) and 'Nikita' (\u041d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0301\u0442\u0430), a literary pseudonym A. Gal (\u0410. \u0413\u0430\u0301\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439), was a prominent Ukrainian Bolshevik leader and diplomat. ==Early career== He was born in Chernigov the son of an infantry officer. He was of Ukrainian ethnicity. He studied at the secondary military school of Voronezh, but left the army in 1901, and joined a student Marxist circle in Warsaw. He graduated from military college in St Petersburg in 1904. In 1902 he secretly joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), and set about organising a military section of the party among graduate officers in five cities. Early in the Russian Revolution of 1905, he led an uprising in Novo-Alexandria in Poland and was arrested for the first time, but escaped to Vienna in spring 1905. There he joined the Menshevik faction of the RSDLP. He returned to St Petersburg in May, and was made chairman of the military organisation of the RSDLP St Petersburg committee. Rearrested in April 1906, he broke jail five days later, and moved to Sevastopol, on Crimea, where he organised a military revolt. Arrested and sentenced to death, his sentence was later commuted to 20 years hard labour in Siberia. He escaped in June 1907, and hid out in Moscow, in the home of a sympathetic lawyer, Pavel Malyantovich. For three years, he worked among co-operatives and with the printers' union in Moscow, until his next arrest, after which he emigrated to Prussia, in July 1910, but was deported, and settled in Paris, where he acted as secretary of the Menshevik bureau. Soon after the outbreak of World War I, Antonov-Ovseyenko broke with the Mensheviks, and founded the anti-war paper Golos (\u0413\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441 - 'Voice'), later renamed Nashe Slovo (\u041d\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e - Our Word), which he co-edited with Leon Trotsky and Yuli Martov. He returned to Russia in June 1917, joined the Bolsheviks and was briefly head of the party organisation in Helsingfors, and Chairman of the Northern Congress of Soviets. He was arrested after the pro- Bolshevik riots in July, and detained, with Trotsky, in Krestny prison. He was freed on the day that the right wing military revolt led by General Kornilov collapsed, and returned to Helsingfors. == Storming the Winter Palace == Antonov-Ovseyenko returned to Petrograd in October 1917, and was appointed secretary of the Military revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet. This meant that he played a pivotal role in military preparations for the October Revolution. Trotsky, who witnessed him in action, described him as \"politically shaky, but personally courageous - impulsive and disorderly, but capable of initiative...\" He personally led the famous storming of the Winter Palace, on 7 November (25 October according to Julian Calendar still used in Russia at the time), when Red Guards broke into the building where ministers of the Russian Provisional Government (excluding Prime Minister Alexander Kerensky), had taken refuge, and arrested them. They included Kerensky's Minister for Justice, Pavel Malyantovich, who had given Antonov-Ovseyenko sanctuary ten years earlier. There were no lives lost in this incident, which took on something like mythical status in Soviet history. It formed the climax of the classic 1928 silent movie, October, directed by Sergei Eisenstein, in which Antonov-Ovseyenko took a starring role, playing himself. == Political career == In the initial government formed by Vladimir Lenin after the Bolsheviks had seized power, Antonov-Ovseyenko was appointed to the Military Committee of Sovnarkom. He was sent to lead the Bolsheviks side in the first, relatively bloodless engagement of the civil war, at Gatchina, against Kerensky and a detachment of Cossacks, but had to replaced after he virtually collapsed from nervous exhaustion. On 21 December 1917, Antonov-Ovseyenko was put in charge of the Revolutionary forces in Ukraine and southern Russia. The army subsequently captured Kharkiv, where Soviet power in Ukraine was proclaimed. He opposed Lenin's decision to end the war with Germany, at the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, and was dismissed from the Red Army in May 1918 for fermenting guerilla warfare against the advancing German army. He was reinstated as People's Commissar for War in Ukraine in September 1918, and oversaw the defeat of Ukrainian People's Republic and White Army forces in Ukraine, ensuring the creation of the Ukrainian SSR. By the end of the Russian Civil War, Antonov-Ovseyenko was in charge of the Tambov Governorate, brutally suppressing 1920\u201321 Tambov Rebellion alongside Mikhail Tukhachevsky, with the use of chemical weapons.Nicolas Werth, Karel Barto\u0161ek, Jean-Louis Pann\u00e9, Jean- Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, St\u00e9phane Courtois, The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression, Harvard University Press, 1999, hardcover, 858 pages, In 1921, he was in charge of famine relief in the Samara region. In 1922, Antonov-Ovseyenko was given the highly sensitive post of head of the Political Directorate of the Red Army, despite his public opposition to Lenin's New Economic Policy, which he denounced in a speech to the April 1922 Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) as a sell-out to the peasants. During Lenin's terminal illness, he backed Trotsky in the struggle for succession. He was a signatory of The Declaration of 46 in October 1923, which called for greater party democracy. In December, after one of his subordinates had been sacked for criticising the leadership, he wrote an angry letter to the Central Committee exclaiming that \"we are not courtiers to the throne of party hierarchs!\" In January 1924, he was summoned before the Orgburo, which was controlled by Josif Stalin, and sacked. Later in 1923, Antonov-Ovseyenko was sent on a mission to China - the start of an 11-year career as a diplomat. In 1925, he was recalled and appointed Soviet representative in Czechoslovakia. He was one of a large group of Trotsky's supporters expelled from the CPSU in December 1927, but was one of the first to recant and seek readmission to the party during 1928. Later he was envoy in Poland, but in May 1934 was recalled to Moscow to serve as a Public Prosecutor. In this capacity, he observed the first of the great Moscow show trials, in which Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev were the main defendants, and signed an article in Izvestia calling for them to be shot. He was then posted to Barcelona, as Soviet Consul General, during the Spanish Civil War, where he directed the supply of Soviet aid to the Second Spanish Republic and where he organized the repression against the POUM party. He was recalled to Moscow in August 1937 where he talked with Joseph Stalin about the events in Spain. After a month without a job he was appointed People's Commissar for Justice of the Russian SFSR in September 1937, but after just one month in post, he was arrested during the night of 11\u201312 October 1937, and interrogated. He was shot on 10 February 1938. Antonov-Ovseyenko was the first former Trotskyist to be posthumously rehabilitated, and in 1956 was named in a speech by Anastas Mikoyan to the 20th party congress. Later, his son Anton, a historian, feared that he was to be 'un-rehabilitated', and fought a long rearguard battle to protect his reputation. ==See also== *Albert Rhys Williams, American journalist that wrote numerous books about the revolutionary activities in Petrograd of 1917\u201318 as being the primary eyewitness of the events. He mentioned Ovseyenko as the military leader of the October Revolution. On several occasions he visited the Soviet Union before World War II. *Anton Antonov-Ovseyenko (1920\u20132013), historian and writer, his son ==References== ==External links== *Historical biography dictionary at hrono.ru *Antonov-Ovseyenko at the protivpytok.org Category:1883 births Category:1939 deaths Category:People from Chernihiv Category:People from Chernigovsky Uyezd Category:Russian people of Ukrainian descent Category:Ukrainian emigrants to Russia Category:Mensheviks Category:Old Bolsheviks Category:Left Opposition Category:Justice ministers of Russia Category:Soviet Ministers of Defence Category:Russian Constituent Assembly members Category:Soviet diplomats Category:Soviet military personnel of the Russian Civil War Category:Recipients of the Order of the Red Banner Category:People of the Russian Revolution Category:Ukrainian people executed by the Soviet Union Category:Great Purge victims from Ukraine Category:Soviet rehabilitations Category:Soviet people of the Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War Category:Soviet defence ministers of Ukraine Category:People of the Hungarian\u2013Romanian War Category:Ambassadors of the Soviet Union to Czechoslovakia Category:Ambassadors of the Soviet Union to Poland ",
