The first public performance was given by the pianist Tatiana de Sanz\u00e9vitch, with Robert Krettly and Jacques Patt\u00e9, in May 1923 for the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Musique in honour of the composer's 78th birthday.\"Musique de Chambre\", Comoedia, 21 May 1923, p. 2 The following month it was performed by the celebrated trio of Alfred Cortot, Jacques Thibaud and Pablo Casals. The work is dedicated to Mme Maurice Rouvier, widow of the former prime minister.Anderson, Keith. Notes to Naxos CD 8.573042, 2013 ==History== Faur\u00e9 had retired as director of the Paris Conservatoire in 1920. Although he had been reluctant to do so, it brought him more free time to devote to composition, and his final years were marked by the production of many substantial new works.Nectoux, Jean-Michel. \"Faur\u00e9, Gabriel (Urbain)\", Grove Online, Oxford Music Online, retrieved 4 March 2018 Jacques Durand, his publisher, suggested in January 1920 that Faur\u00e9 should compose a trio for piano, violin, and cello, and in April he began work, at first in Paris, and later when staying with friends in Argel\u00e8s-sur-Mer in the south of France. Work was temporarily halted by an attack of pneumonia, after which Faur\u00e9 went to his favourite resort, Annecy-le-Vieux, in August, resuming work on the piece.Nichols, Roger. Notes to Hyperion CD CDA30029, 1999 His original plan had been a trio for piano, cello and either a clarinet or violin, but he quickly abandoned the clarinet option and wrote for the classical piano trio. Faur\u00e9 wrote to his wife, who remained in Paris, \"The trouble is that I cannot work for long at a time. My worst tribulation is a perpetual fatigue.\" The musical scholar Roger Nichols comments that the composer's fatigue is not detectable in the completed work, except to the extent that \"there are no more notes than necessary, according to the well-known Mozartian formula\". After returning to Paris Faur\u00e9 completed the trio in mid-February 1923. The premiere was given at a concert of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Musique on 12 May by given by three young graduates of the Conservatoire: Robert Krettly, violin, Jacques Patt\u00e9, cello, and Tatiana Sanz\u00e9vitch, piano. Faur\u00e9 was ill, and could not attend. Durand published the work the same year.Corleonis, Adrian. \"Gabriel Faur\u00e9: Piano Trio in D minor, Op. 120\", AllMusic, retrieved 4 March 2018 The Parisian newspaper Comoedia commented enthusiastically after the first performance, greeting \"a beautiful work that enriches the chamber music repertory\". The reviewer praised \"the elegant clarity, the equilibrium of thought and the serenity\" of Faur\u00e9's recent compositions, and commented on the composer's success in playing the most disparate musical ideas off against each other. Faur\u00e9 was present at the performance the following year, given by the Cortot-Thibaud-Casals Trio.Southon, Nicholas. Notes to Alpha CD ALPHA600, 2011 ==Structure== There are three movements *Allegro ma non troppo *Andantino *Allegro vivo The playing time of the trio is about 18 minutes. ==References== Category:Compositions by Gabriel Faur\u00e9 Category:Compositions for piano trio Category:Compositions in D minor ",
