    "text": "\"House of Love\" is British boy band East 17's debut single, taken from their debut studio album Walthamstow, released in August 1992. It became a number- one hit in Finland for two weeks and in Sweden for six weeks and was a top- forty hit in many other countries between 1992 and 1994. The song was later covered by British pop duo Shampoo and released on their 1994 album We Are Shampoo. ==Background== Initially conceived by former Pet Shop Boys manager Tom Watkins as a tougher version of Take That, East 17 decided that their first single - like Take That's debut - should be an upbeat dance number that would sell to both teenagers and to clubs. Inspired by current dance groups like The KLF and Snap!, Tony Mortimer wrote \"House of Love\" as a mock 'rave' anthem, complete with a 'harmony' rap performed by Brian Harvey. Mortimer sang the main verses with the entire band singing the chorus. The Pedigree Mix of the song, complete with an explosion and then a dog barking at the beginning and the end, was released as the single, complete with a low-budget video. \"House of Love\" shot to No. 10 on the UK Singles Chart, establishing East 17 as a premier pop act. It was included on their first album, Walthamstow, and their 1996 greatest hits compilation. On 15 April 2011, T-Mobile uploaded a video parody of the JK Wedding Entrance DanceJK Wedding Entrance Dance - YouTube.com portraying the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton weeks before the actual Royal Wedding using choreography with the group's song.The T-Mobile Royal Wedding - YouTube.com ==Critical reception== Tom Doyle from Smash Hits gave the song 4 out of 5, commenting, \"Looking a bit like a cross between Take That and Flowered Up in their trendy Essex techno gear, E17 come up with this well catchy tune with background barking supplied by their dog\". ==Music video== There were made two different music videos for the song. A European and an US version. The latter was directed by Scott Kennedy. The European version was uploaded to YouTube in September 2017. In August 2020, the video has got more than 2,300,000 views. ==Track listing== * UK Cassette (1992) # \"House of Love\" (Pedigree mix) \u2014 4:41 # \"House of Love\" (Son of a Bitch mix) \u2014 9:05 # \"House of Love\" (Glossy Coat mix) \u2014 8:08 # \"House of Love\" (Wet Nose mix) \u2014 6:10 * UK 7\" single (1992) # \"House of Love\" (Pedigree mix) \u2014 4:41 # \"House of Love\" (The Expedient demo) \u2014 7:43 * UK 12\" single (1992) # \"House of Love\" (Son of a Bitch mix) \u2014 9:05 # \"House of Love\" (Glossy Coat mix) \u2014 8:08 # \"House of Love\" (Wet Nose mix) \u2014 6:10 * UK CD single (1992) # \"House of Love\" (Pedigree mix) \u2014 4:41 # \"House of Love\" (Son of a Bitch mix) \u2014 9:05 # \"House of Love\" (Glossy Coat mix) \u2014 8:08 # \"House of Love\" (Wet Nose mix) \u2014 6:10 * American CD single (1993) # \"House of Love\" (Pedigree mix) \u2014 4:41 # \"House of Love\" (Son of a Bitch mix) \u2014 9:05 # \"House of Love\" (Glossy Coat mix) \u2014 8:08 # \"House of Love\" (Wet Nose mix) \u2014 6:10 * American 12\" single (1993) # \"House of Love\" (Son of a Bitch mix) \u2014 9:05 # \"House of Love\" (Wet Nose mix) \u2014 6:10 # \"House of Love\" (Murk's Main mix) \u2014 6:41 # \"House of Love\" (Oscar G's Dope dub) \u2014 6:45 * French CD single (1992) # \"House of Love\" (Pedigree mix) \u2014 4:41 # \"House of Love\" (The Expedient demo) \u2014 7:43 * Australian CD single (1992) # \"House of Love\" (Pedigree mix) \u2014 4:41 # \"House of Love\" (Wet Nose mix) \u2014 6:10 ==Charts and sales== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1992\u20131994) !Peak position |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |9 |- !scope=\"row\"|Finland (Suomen virallinen lista) |1 |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Israel (Israel Top-30)Israel Top-30: 3 weeks at No. 1 (15.9.92, 22.9.92 & 30.9.92) |1 |- !scope=\"row\"|Japan (Oricon)Oricon Singles Chart Oricon Singles Chart (Retrieved 2 November 2012) |3 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Music Week Dance Singles |15 |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1993) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA) |31 |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |55 |- !scope=\"row\"|Germany (Official German Charts) |38 |} {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1994) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) |229 |- |} ===Certifications=== ==References== ==External links== * House of Love music video on YouTube * Alternate House of Love music video on YouTube * Category:1992 debut singles Category:1992 songs Category:East 17 songs Category:Hip house songs Category:London Records singles Category:Number-one singles in Finland Category:Number-one singles in Israel Category:Number-one singles in Sweden Category:Songs written by Tony Mortimer ",
