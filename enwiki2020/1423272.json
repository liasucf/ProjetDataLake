He was the son of Sergio Osme\u00f1a, the fourth President of the Philippines. His son in turn was Sergio \"Serge\" Osme\u00f1a III, who also became a Senator of the Philippines. ==Early life== Osme\u00f1a was born in Cebu City on December 4, 1916, to former Philippine President Sergio Osme\u00f1a Sr. and Estefania Chiong Veloso.

Elected as representative for the second district of Cebu in 1958, his notable work as fiscalizer brought him recognition from the Congressional Press Club which voted him as one of the Ten Most Outstanding Congressmen of 1959.

In the November 1965 elections, he won a seat in the Philippine Senate. ===1969 Philippine Presidential election=== Osme\u00f1a publicly opposed the Marcos administration. On April 5th 1969, at the St. Francis Hotel, San Francisco, Marcos accused Osme\u00f1a of collaborating with the Japanese in World War II. Later on June 15, Osme\u00f1a won the Liberal Party nomination for President of the Philippines, and would run against incumbent President Ferdinand Marcos for the 1969 Philippine presidential election. It was an election regarded as the \"dirtiest, most violent and most corrupt\" in Philippine history. Marcos spent $50 million USD in infrastructure projects in an effort to curry favor with the electorate. This rapid campaign spending was so massive that it would be responsible for the Balance of Payments Crisis of 1970, whose inflationary effect would cause social unrest leading all the way up to the proclamation of Martial Law in 1972. Marcos was reported to have spent PhP 100 for every PhP 1 that Osmena spent, using up PhP 24 Million in Cebu alone. The Marcos administration conducted vote-buying, terrorism and ballot snatching. Marcos also used the Armed Forces of the Philippines to disseminate his campaign propaganda. ===Subsequent activities=== Following his presidential loss, Osme\u00f1a continued as a leader in the Liberal Party. On August 21, 1971 Osme\u00f1a along with prominent members of the Liberal Party held a proclamation rally at the Plaza Miranda in Quiapo.

Afterwards, Osme\u00f1a left for the United States and lived in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles. Marcos proclaimed martial law in September 1972 and submitted documents to the U.S. Congress. The documents were regarded as bizarre, in addition to a \"communist threat\" of the Communist Party of the Philippines and the \"rebellion\" of the Muslim Independence Movement, the documents charged that declaration of martial law was also due to a plot to kill Marcos. Osme\u00f1a was accused of being a key figure in the plot, though no formal charges were filed against him. ==Personal life== He was married to Lourdes de la Rama of Negros Occidental with whom he had five children: Sergio Osme\u00f1a III; Mar\u00eda Victoria Osme\u00f1a; Esteban Osme\u00f1a; Tomas Osme\u00f1a; and Georgia Osme\u00f1a. ==Death== Osme\u00f1a died of respiratory failure at the age of 67 on March 26, 1984 at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. ==References== Category:1916 births Category:1984 deaths Category:Ateneo de Manila University alumni Category:Candidates in the 1969 Philippine presidential election Category:Cebuano people Category:Children of Presidents of the Philippines Category:Deaths from respiratory failure Category:Filipino Roman Catholics Category:Governors of Cebu Category:Independent politicians in the Philippines Category:Liberal Party (Philippines) politicians Category:Mayors of Cebu City Category:Members of the House of Representatives of the Philippines from Cebu Category:New York University Stern School of Business alumni Sergio Category:People from Cebu City Category:Philippine vice-presidential candidates, 1961 Category:Senators of the 6th Congress of the Philippines Category:Senators of the 7th Congress of the Philippines ",
