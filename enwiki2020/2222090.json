It is the second and final album to feature the four-piece lineup of Lemmy, Phil Campbell, W\u00fcrzel, and Mikkey Dee, as W\u00fcrzel left the band after the album's recording. ==Recording== Mot\u00f6rhead reunited with producer Howard Benson for Sacrifice. \"This is a very good album\", vocalist and bassist Lemmy wrote in the sleeve notes, \"Put it in your system and your girlfriend's clothes fall off..\" CD liner notes. Lemmy views Sacrifice as one of his favourite records the band has made, despite the difficulties involved, which he explained as: In the documentary The Guts and the Glory, all three band members express regret over W\u00fcrzel's departure, but insist it was inevitable, with drummer Mikkey Dee commenting: Campbell, who joined Mot\u00f6rhead with W\u00fcrzel in 1984, recalls: In the same film, Lemmy reveals that W\u00fcrzel began to suspect that he was being ripped off financially: The band went into the studio with some great songs, Lemmy recalls, although \"Sex & Death\" was written in ten minutes on the last day of recording, \"In Another Time\" was altered beyond all recognition and there were three sets of lyrics for \"Make 'Em Blind.\" Dee and Campbell didn't realise that \"Out of the Sun\" was only two and half verses and had rehearsed it as such but Lemmy added another section when nobody else was around, with him playing bass and Jamie, his guitar roadie, playing guitar. He then gave the others a tape of it. According to Lemmy, when W\u00fcrzel played it in the rental car he nearly drove off the road. \"Make 'Em Blind\" came from improvisation, with Campbell recording the solo in one take, falling over the couch and onto his back laughing uproariously. Lemmy states that the album contains more nonsense than most of the previous album \u2013 the lyrics don't mean anything you can really get a hold of \u2013 but that they convey the mood, especially the title track and \"Out of the Sun.\" \"Dog Face Boy\" is about Campbell, but Lemmy decided that only after having written it, likening the line \"Poor boy out your mind again/Jet plane outside looking for another friend\" to Campbell's habit of quickly hitting town and looking for fun after getting off the plane. ==Release== It was not a success nor did it make much impact on the album charts, as with the previous album, it was largely ignored by the general public. With a new label it was released correctly, compared to Bastards, and the title track has stayed in the live set for some time, but there hasn't been much written about this album that is noteworthy. The title track was used in the movie Tromeo and Juliet, a film in which Lemmy appears. The American version of the album cover had W\u00fcrzel airbrushed out but, according to Joel McIver's book Overkill: The Untold Story of Mot\u00f6rhead, Lemmy insists that this was the record label's idea, not theirs: Rather than hiring a new guitar player, the band decided to revert to a three-piece. ==Sleeve artwork== Joe Petagno, the sleeve artist, was well known for inserting references to genitalia in his drawings, and this one was no exception. He commented: ==Critical reception== AllMusic states that: In 2011 Mot\u00f6rhead biographer Joel McIver wrote that Sacrifice: ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Per the Sacrifice liner notes. * Lemmy \u2013 lead vocals, bass * Phil \"Z\u00f6\u00f6m\" Campbell \u2013 lead & rhythm guitar; guitar solo on all tracks except \"Dog Face Boy\" * Michael \"W\u00fcrzel\" Burston \u2013 rhythm & lead guitar; guitar solo on \"Dog Face Boy\" and \"Out Of The Sun\" * Mikkey Dee \u2013 drums * Bill Bergman \u2013 saxophone on \"Don't Waste Your Time\" * John Paroulo \u2013 piano on \"Don't Waste Your Time\" ::W\u00fcrzel is uncredited on the North American CD release album liner notes, that was also sold in other territories, other than to state he played guitar solo on two tracks. He is not listed as a member of the band, or for writing credits either, even though he plays rhythm guitar on the entire album.Sacrifice, Mot\u00f6rhead, CMC International, CMC 7803, 1995 Liner Notes, page 3 & 15 The SPV German/European release of the album has the correct liner notes; W\u00fcrzels thank-you's, writing credits, etc === Production === *Howard Benson \u2013 producer, mixing *Ryan Dorn \u2013 producer, engineer, mixing *Devin Foutz \u2013 assistant engineer *Matthew Ellard \u2013 assistant engineer *Eddy Schreyer \u2013 mastering *Mot\u00f6rhead \u2013 executive producers *Gene Kirkland \u2013 photography *Robert John \u2013 photography *DemoNet, Inc \u2013 art design and layout *David Patterson \u2013 typeface and pagemaster *Joe Petagno \u2013 Snaggletooth, album cover == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart !Peak position |- |German Albums (Offizielle Top 100) | align=\"center\" |31 |- |Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) | align=\"center\" |36 |- |} ==References== ==External links== *Sample tracks at Rolling Stone *Mot\u00f6rhead official website Category:Mot\u00f6rhead albums Category:1995 albums Category:Albums with cover art by Joe Petagno Category:Albums produced by Howard Benson Category:SPV/Steamhammer albums Category:CMC International albums ",
