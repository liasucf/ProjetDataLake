    "text": "Coast Modern is an American indie pop duo based in Los Angeles, California, known for their 2015 single \u201cHollow Life.\u201d The duo consists of Luke Atlas and Coleman Trapp. ==History== ===Early beginnings-2015=== Luke Atlas is a Seattle, Washington native and Coleman Trapp is from Los Angeles. Trapp played the drums and piano growing up and sang for the first time at age 23, and Atlas played the guitar in the band Brite Futures, previously known as Natalie Portman's Shaved Head. The two met in Los Angeles shortly after Atlas moved there, and they began writing songs together. After two years of little success between the two, Trapp decided to return to his hometown of Denver. He then began recording some notes on a borrowed acoustic guitar, mailing the recordings to Atlas to listen to. Atlas then recorded a demo around one and mailed it back to Trapp, encouraging him to return to Los Angeles. One of the first songs written and released by Coast Modern is \u201cHollow Life\u201d, released in 2015. ===February 2016-present=== In February 2016, the band released their second single \u201cAnimals.\u201d Coast Modern first performed live at South by Southwest in 2016. In May 2016, the band released their third single \u201cGuru.\u201d They began performing on various tour dates with B\u00d8RNS, The Temper Trap, and The Wombats in that same month, with tour dates that run through October 2016. Coast Modern is currently signed to 300 Entertainment and +1 Records. Their self-titled debut album was released on July 28, 2017. ==Influences== Atlas has cited The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Led Zeppelin, and Weezer as some of his influences. In his own words, \u201cpart of the Coast Modern sound comes from embracing the music we loved when we were young, even if it\u2019s not \u2018cool\u2019 now.\u201d ==Discography== *Hollow Life (single) 2015 *Animals (single) 2016 *Guru (single) 2016 *The Way It Was (single) 2016 *Comb My Hair (single) 2017 *Pockets Full of No (single) 2017 *Dreamland 2020 (mixtape) 2017 *Dive (single) 2017 *Coast Modern (album) 2017 *Electric Feel (single) 2018 *Puppy Llama (single) 2019 ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles Category:Indie pop groups from California Category:Musical groups established in 2015 Category:American pop music groups Category:American pop rock music groups Category:Indie pop groups from Los Angeles Category:American musical duos ",
