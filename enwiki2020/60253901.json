    "text": "Manuel Zamarre\u00f1o Villoria (San Sebasti\u00e1n, January 6, 1955 - Renter\u00eda, June 25, 1998) was a Spanish politician assassinated by Basque separatist group ETA, an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the Spanish government. == Biography == Manuel Zamarre\u00f1o Villoria was killed by ETA in Renter\u00eda on June 25, 1998. He had been a councillor for 34 days in Renter\u00eda, replacing the also assassinated Jos\u00e9 Luis Caso, coppersmith as a profession, although he was unemployed. He was married and had two children. === Murder === Before being assassinated, Manuel Zamarre\u00f1o had suffered attacks and threats. ETA set his vehicle on fire. On the morning of June 25, 1998, at about 11:10 a.m. Manuel Zamarre\u00f1o left his home in the neighbourhood of Capuchinos de Renter\u00eda, to buy bread. Upon returning, ETA activated the three kilos of amonal that had been placed on a motorcycle that was parked on the sidewalk and whose pump was activated from distance. When the bomb exploded, Manuel Zamarre\u00f1o was fully hit by it. He lay without life between two cars parked in battery, surrounded by a pool of blood and with clothes torn off. The member of the Ertzaintza escorting him, Juan Mar\u00eda Quintana, was also hit by the explosion and suffered injuries. He suffered from shrapnel and wounds in one eye. He was taken by ambulance to the hospital, where he was admitted with a shock wave syndrome, multiple injuries from shrapnel in a large part of the body and ocular trauma, so he was surgically operated. The blast wave of the explosion also caused major damages to several cars and homes. The Ertzaintza moved to the area and carried out the first steps. Two and a half hours later the judge ordered the lifting of the corpse. The summary of this murder was initiated by the Central Court of Instruction No. 2 of the National Court. This court decreed by auto in December 1999 the provisional dismissal. After this attack, there was no claim by ETA in the following days, though ETA were blamed. Since no judgment has been handed down for this attack, nor any investigation that attributes to the authors, the identity of the murderers is unknown. == Bibliography == * MERINO, A., CHAPA, A., Ra\u00edces de Libertad. pp. 159\u2013169.
