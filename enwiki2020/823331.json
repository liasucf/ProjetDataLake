He never excelled in this event nationally and was the Finnish champion in the 800 m in 1928\u20131930 and 1934. Larva finished 10th in the 1500 m at the 1932 Summer Olympics. Larva was requested to change his last name in 1928 by Urho Kekkonen, then president of Finnish Athletics Union and later president of Finland, who thought that his birth name Lagerstr\u00f6m did not sound Finnish enough. ==References== * Category:1906 births Category:1980 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Turku Category:Finnish male middle-distance runners Category:Olympic athletes of Finland Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1928 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1932 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1928 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists for Finland Category:Olympic gold medalists in athletics (track and field) ",
