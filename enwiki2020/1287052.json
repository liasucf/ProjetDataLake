It is also a major attraction during the Tamworth Country Music Festival. ==History== The Golden Guitar was erected in front of the famous Longyard Hotel on the Sydney Road in 1988. It was unveiled by Australia's most popular country music artist, Slim Dusty. Its location in Tamworth is symbolic of the city's recognition and celebration of Australian country music, and its artists. An award ceremony takes place every year where miniature Golden Guitars are given as awards to artists and musicians in recognition of their achievements and contributions in the genre of country music. An estimated 3.6 million photographs have been taken of the site since its opening. In 2018, the Tamworth Visitor Information Centre at the Big Golden Guitar Tourist Centre welcomed 117,000 visitors. The iconic structure will take on a new lease of life as Council plans for the future of the Tourist Centre with the aim to build the visitor numbers.
