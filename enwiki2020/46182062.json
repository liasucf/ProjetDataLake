    "text": "Major General Rupert Timothy Herbert Jones, (born 29 April 1969) is a senior British Army officer, currently serving as the Standing Joint Force Commander since November 2018. ==Early life== Jones was born in Germany, the youngest son of H. Jones, who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions as commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment during the Battle of Goose Green in the Falklands War of 1982. Rupert Jones attended St. Peter's Preparatory School in Seaford, Sussex and Sherborne School. He later read History at Reading University. ==Military career== Jones joined the British Army as an undergraduate cadet in 1987 and was commissioned into the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment, his father's former regiment. He served his early career in Germany, Northern Ireland and Bosnia, and was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 2001 Birthday Honours. Following company command, he served as Chief of Staff 12th Mechanized Brigade, deploying to Iraq in 2005. He served as commanding officer of 4th Battalion, The Rifles from 2008 to 2010, during which the battalion deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation Herrick. In February 2010, he launched the Care for Casualties appeal on behalf of the Rifles. During his career Jones has served in the Ministry of Defence (MOD) on numerous occasions, including as an SO3 in the Directorate of Military Operations with responsibility for Military Aid to the Civil Authorities and Counter Terrorism, as Military Assistant to the MOD's Director of Operations, as the Armed Forces representative advising Lord Levene's Steering Group during Defence Reform, and for a short period as the Chief of the General Staff's Colonel Army Strategy. Jones was promoted to colonel, with seniority, from July 2011. He completed the Higher Command and Staff Course the following year and then took command of 1st Armoured Infantry Brigade, where he commanded Task Force Helmand from April to October 2013. While in Afghanistan, he was promoted to brigadier. In March 2014, he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire, following service to the War in Afghanistan. From 2014 to 2016, he served as the Assistant Chief of Staff Operations and the Chief of Staff to the Standing Joint Commander (UK) in the Army HQ. ===Operation Inherent Resolve=== Jones speaks with a British explosive ordnance disposal trainer during a visit near left In April 2016 Jones was promoted to major general, becoming, at age 47, the youngest general in the British Army at the time, and was appointed the deputy commander of Combined Joint Task Force \u2013 Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR) later that year. In November 2016, he hailed the \"extraordinary amount of progress\" made by the international coalition, as result of their daily strikes against Da'esh. In the same month, he commented \"go and ask your Da'esh commander if they've been hit hard enough\" in response to Donald Trump's comment that \"I know more Isis than the generals do, believe me. I would bomb the shit out of them\" in 2015. In February 2017, during a briefing in London, Jones stated: \"We as an international coalition have always been very clear: if you are going to take up arms on behalf of Da'esh, and you are going to kill innocent civilians, we will find you and we will kill you. That does not matter whether they are from London, or Paris, or from Baghdad. We will target you under the laws of armed conflict\". He added that Da'esh fighters were being killed \"at a rate they simply can't sustain\". Commenting on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, he said: \"If we in the international coalition knew where he was, for certain then he wouldn't stay alive for very long. I think if he was dead then there probably would have been an announcement to say he's dead. Most of Baghdadi's lieutenants are dead. He is now frankly in hiding. His narrative of some kind of caliphate, well that's exposed as a lie when you're in hiding yourself.\" In August 2017, Jones echoed comments made by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in a Pentagon press conference, by giving Da'esh fighters the choice to \"surrender or die\". He went on to say that Da'esh \"are losing on all fronts. They are losing on the battlefield, they are losing financially, the flow of foreign fighters has slowed to a trickle. Their narrative has been significantly discredited\". Jones handed over to Major General Felix Gedney in late August 2017. ===Senior staff and command=== In January 2018, Jones was appointed Assistant Chief of the General Staff in succession to Major General Nick Welch. The role represents the Chief of the General Staff in Whitehall. Jones was appointed an Officer of the Legion of Merit by the United States in May 2018. On 3 September 2018, his title was renamed as Director Engagement and Communications (D E&C;), assisting in communicating army statements across defence internally and externally. He handed over D E&C; to Major General Neil Sexton on 13 November 2018. Jones was appointed Standing Joint Force Commander in November 2018. ==References== ==External links== *UK troops prepare for Helmand tour Category:1969 births Category:British Army personnel of the Iraq War Category:British Army personnel of the War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present) Category:British military personnel of the Troubles Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Devonshire and Dorset Regiment officers Category:Graduates of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst Category:Living people Category:People educated at Sherborne School Category:The Rifles officers Category:British Army generals ",
