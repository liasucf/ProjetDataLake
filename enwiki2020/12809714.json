With few baserris, its population began rising after the railway station was built in the 19th century, when flats started being built. It has 3,696 inhabitants as of 2005. Due to its distance from the town center, there have been some initiatives to make it independent. Usansolo is home to a Bridgestone tire cord plant. ==Famous people== * Idoia Zenarrutzabeitia Beldarrain ==External links == *Page about Lekue Tower at the web of Galdakao Town Council Category:Populated places in Biscay ",
