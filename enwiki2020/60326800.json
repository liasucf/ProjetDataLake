    "text": "N,N-Dimethyl-2-chloro-2-phenylethylamine is chemical compound that irreversibly inhibits the acetylcholinesterase. This compound, when dissolved water, decomposes into a highly reactive aziridinium ion, N,N-dimethyl-2-phenylaziridinium (DPA). DPA binds to the anionic site of acetylcholinesterase, where it alkylates and irreversibly inhibits the enzyme. ==See also== *Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor ==References== Category:Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors Category:Nitrogen mustards Category:Phenethylamines Category:Organochlorides ",
