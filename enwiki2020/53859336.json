    "text": "The gens Pescennia was a plebeian family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens are first mentioned in the time of Cicero, but it was not until imperial times that they came to prominence. The Pescennii were of equestrian rank. The most illustrious of the family was Gaius Pescennius Niger, an able general, who was proclaimed emperor in AD 193, only to be defeated and put to death by Septimius Severus the following year.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, pp. 1201, 1202 (\"Gaius Pescennius Niger\"). ==Origin== The nomen Pescennius is one of several similar gentilicia formed with the suffix -ennius, which was more typical of Oscan names than of Latin. It is derived from an Oscan praenomen, Pescennus or Perscennus, cognate with the Latin adjective praecandus, referring to someone whose hair was greying or prematurely grey.Chase, pp. 127, 128.. ==Praenomina== The Pescennii used a variety of praenomina, of which the most important were Lucius, Quintus, and Marcus, Gaius, and Publius, all of which were very common throughout Roman history. Some of the Pescennii bore other names, including Sextus, Titus, or Gnaeus, which were also common praenomina. A less common name borne by one of the family was Statius, an Oscan praenomen that was little used at Rome, but more frequent in rural Italy. ==Members== * Gnaeus Pescennius L. l., a freedman, named in an inscription from Capua, dating to 105 BC.. * Titus Pescennius T. f., named in an inscription from Capua, dating to 105 BC. * Pescennius, a friend of Cicero during his exile at Thessalonica.Cicero, Epistulae ad Familiares, xiv. 4. * Marcus Pescennius M. l.
