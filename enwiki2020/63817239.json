In the Europe/Africa Zone there were four different tiers, called groups, in which teams competed against each other to advance to the upper tier. Winners in Group II advanced to the Europe/Africa Zone Group I. Teams who lost their respective ties competed in the relegation play-offs, with winning teams remaining in Group II, whereas teams who lost their play- offs were relegated to the Europe/Africa Zone Group III in 2000. ==Participating nations== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ===Draw=== ==First round== ===Denmark vs. Senegal=== ===Ireland vs. Slovenia=== ===Hungary vs. Greece=== ===Bulgaria vs. Togo=== ===Latvia vs. Poland=== ===Ivory Coast vs. Macedonia=== ===Morocco vs. Yugoslavia=== ===Norway vs. Turkey=== ==Second round== ===Denmark vs. Ireland=== ===Hungary vs. Bulgaria=== ===Ivory Coast vs. Poland=== ===Norway vs. Morocco=== ==Relegation play-offs== ===Slovenia vs. Senegal=== ===Togo vs. Greece=== ===Latvia vs. Macedonia=== ===Turkey vs. Yugoslavia=== ==Third round== ===Hungary vs. Denmark=== ===Morocco vs. Poland=== ==References== ==External links== *Davis Cup official website Category:Davis Cup Europe/Africa Zone Europe/Africa Zone Group II ",
