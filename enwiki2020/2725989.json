    "text": "La Source, Paris, 1866 Louis Alexandre M\u00e9rante (23 July 1828\u2013Courbevoie, 17 July 1887) was a dancer and choreographer, the Ma\u00eetre de Ballet (First Balletmaster/Chief Choreographer) of the Paris Opera Ballet at the Salle Le Peletier until its destruction by fire in 1873, and subsequently the first Ballet Master at the company's new Palais Garnier, which opened in 1875. He is best remembered as the choreographer of L\u00e9o Delibes' Sylvia, ou la nymphe de Diane (1876). With Arthur Saint-L\u00e9on and Jules Perrot, he is one of the three choreographers who defined the French ballet tradition during the Second French Empire and the Third Republic according to choreographer Pierre Lacotte. ==Biography== Born in Paris, M\u00e9rante was a pupil of Lucien Petipa, with whom he figured on the six-member select jury of the first annual competition for the Corps de ballet, held on 13 April 1860. The jury included the director of the new Conservatoire de danse, as well as the former ballerina Marie Taglioni, its guiding spirit. Following Sylvia M\u00e9rante choreographed Le Fandango, a ballet-pantomime that premiered November 26, 1877 and had as librettists for the mimed action the team of Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy, who provided librettos to Offenbach and had recently delivered a libretto on a similarly Spanish theme to Georges Bizet\u2014Carmen. His ballet, Les Deux Pigeons, after the fable by La Fontaine, to music by Andr\u00e9 Messager has been revived with new choreography, as a showpiece for the youngest dancers of the Paris Opera Ballet. But other ballets, with a mime libretto whose authors normally shared credit with M\u00e9rante, are perhaps an irretrievably lost part of ballet history: La Korrigane, \"ballet fantastique\" by Fran\u00e7ois Copp\u00e9e, choreographed by M\u00e9rante; Les Jumeaux de Bergame, \"ballet- arlequinade\" by Charles Nuitter and M\u00e9rante, to music by Th. de Lajarte, and others, produced season after season for the Op\u00e9ra Garnier. Edgar Degas included the figure of M\u00e9rante, in an immaculate white suit, with the traditional baton for beating time on the floorboards, in his 1872 painting Le foyer de danse. The painting marked the beginning of D\u00e9gas' long infatuation with the ballet, but though he had sketched the individual dancers, and the practice room in the company's old premises in the Salle Le Peletier, with its great arched mirror, he was not permitted to attend a rehearsal in person. Edgar Degas included M\u00e9rante in his Foyer de Danse \u00e0 l'Op\u00e9ra de la rue Le Peletier, which shows the Balletmaster rehearsing in the Foyer de la Danse of the Salle Le Peletier, 1872 Wife (in 1861): the Russian ballerina (Mlle Zina, \u00e9toile in 1857-1863), which father Joseph Richard was the French ballet dancer and arrived to Russia in 1823 with his niece (or sister) and her husband Fernando Sor. ==See also== * Leap! ==References== ==External links== *Le Fandango *Concours Annuel du Corps de ballet de l'Op\u00e9ra (pdf file; in French) *Interview with Pierre Lacotte from Ballet Magazine August 2000 Category:French male ballet dancers Category:French ballet masters Category:Ballet choreographers Category:French choreographers Category:French ballet librettists Category:People from Paris Category:1828 births Category:1887 deaths Louis Merante Category:19th-century French ballet dancers Category:Paris Opera Ballet \u00e9toiles Category:Paris Opera Ballet artistic directors ",
