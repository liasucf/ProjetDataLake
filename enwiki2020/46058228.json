Last year's cup holder, Navy SC, even though they won twelve matches narrowly lost the league by percentage to Kandy SC, who won eleven games. As Colombo Hockey and Football Club and the Hambantota Sharks both withdrew from the league competition midway through the season the second-round games were played only between seven teams. Kandy SC having the top seeding were awarded a first round bye in the Cup competition. # Kandy SC # Navy SC # Havelock SC # Ceylonese R & FC # Army SC # Police SC # Air Force SC ==Quarter finals== ==Semi finals== ==Final== ==References== 2015 Category:2015 rugby union tournaments for clubs Category:2015 in Asian rugby union Category:2015 in Sri Lankan sport ",
