    "text": "\"Love Hurts\" is a song written and composed by the American songwriter Boudleaux Bryant. First recorded by the Everly Brothers in July 1960, the song is also well known from a 1975 international hit version by the Scottish hard rock band Nazareth and in the UK a top five hit in 1975 by the English singer Jim Capaldi. ==Appearances== The song was introduced in December 1960 as an album track on A Date with The Everly Brothers, but was never released as a single (A-side or B-side) by the Everlys. The first hit version of the song was by Roy Orbison, who earned Australian radio play, hitting the Top Five of that country's singles charts in 1961. A recording by Emmylou Harris and Gram Parsons was included on Parsons' posthumously released Grievous Angel album. After Parsons' 1973 death, Harris made the song a staple of her repertoire, and has included it in her concert set lists from the 1970s to the present. Harris has since re-recorded the song twice. Jennifer Warnes released a version on her self-titled album in 1976. The most successful recording of the song was by hard rock band Nazareth, who took the song to the U.S. Top 10 in 1975 and hit number one in Norway and the Netherlands. In the UK the most successful version of the song was by former Traffic member Jim Capaldi, who took it to number four in the charts in November 1975 during an 11-week run. The song was also covered by Cher in 1975 for her album Stars. Cher re- recorded the song in 1991 for her album of the same name. Joan Jett included a version of the song on her 1990 album, The Hit List, a covers compilation. Rod Stewart recorded the song in 2006 for his album Still the Same... Great Rock Classics of Our Time which was No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. The bluegrass version appearing in both the Deadpool 2 \"Super Duper Cut\" and the \"Once Upon A Deadpool\" DVD, during the montages featuring the titular character's failed suicide attempts following Vanessa's death, was first recorded by The Osborne Brothers for their 1977 Release \"From Rocky Top To Muddy Bottom: The Songs Of Boudleaux & Felice Bryant\".https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5463162/soundtrack?ref_=tt_trv_snd Jazz guitarist Julian Lage performs the song on his 2019 album of the same name. == Roy Orbison version == Roy Orbison covered \"Love Hurts\" in 1961 and issued it as the B-side to \"Running Scared.\" While \"Running Scared\" was an international hit, the B-side only picked up significant airplay in Australia. Consequently, chart figures for Australia show \"Running Scared\"/\"Love Hurts\" as a double A-Side, both sides peaking at No. 5. This makes Orbison's recording of \"Love Hurts\" the first version to be a hit. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1961) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Australia | style=\"text-align:center;\"|5 |} == Jim Capaldi version == Jim Capaldi reached number 4 in the UK charts with his interpretation of \"Love Hurts\" in November 1975, which was to prove his highest charting UK single.Jim Capaldi in the UK charts , The Official Charts.
