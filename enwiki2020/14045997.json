Although sometimes termed Destroyer escorts, they were larger and more capable than contemporary United States Navy destroyer escorts or the Imperial Japanese Navy kaib\u014dkan vessels. ==Background== Even by 1942, the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff realized that attrition of its destroyer force was not sustainable. There was a growing need for a simplified design which could be quickly mass-produced which could serve primarily as convoy escorts and as destroyer-transports in front-line locations, but would still be capable of working with the fleet if necessary. Emphasis was placed on anti-aircraft guns and anti-submarine weapons, and radar, as operations against surface targets was deemed unlikely. Forty-two vessels were ordered and work began in August 1943. In the middle of 1944, the orders for twenty-four of these vessels were replaced with a further-simplified design, designated the or . The Tachibana- class had straight lines and a modular construction to facilitate mass- production.The Imperial Japanese Navy had plans to build another hundred and twelve Tachibana-class vessels, but only fourteen were completed before construction was cancelled, with resources diverted to \"special-attack units\". ==Design== The Matsu-class destroyers displaced standard with a length of overall. In order to simplify construction and reduce construction time, the Matsu-class destroyers used the same turbine engine as the , with two Kampon boilers The engine could develop only , which gave the vessels a top speed of just under . The boiler and the machinery rooms were separated to improve on survivability to combat damage. The class was well armed for a ship of its size. The main battery was the 12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval gun used as a primary anti-aircraft gun on many Japanese capital ships. A single gun was located forward with an anti-spray shield rather than a gun turret, and a dual mount was located aft with no protection at all. However, the lack of a high-angle fire-control director limited the anti-aircraft effectiveness of these weapons. Each vessel also had a quadruple torpedo launcher with Type 93 torpedoes, but no reloads. Further anti-aircraft protection was provided by four Type 96 AA gun triple-mounts and eight single-mounts and both a Type 22 and Type 13 radar. The number of single-mounts was increased on certain individual vessels to thirteen. For anti-submarine warfare, each vessel also had two Type 94 depth charge projectors with 48 depth charges. The Tachibana- class, entering service in 1945, had the same armament as the Matsu-class, but initially with 13 single-mount Type 96s instead of eight. This was later increased to as many as 19. Only one vessel, , was modified to launch a single kaiten manned torpedo from her stern, although there were plans to covert another 11 to this configuration just before the war came to an end. ==Operational history== Matsu-class destroyers were assigned to Destroyer Divisions 43, 52, and 53. Few Matsu-class units saw extensive service beyond Japanese home waters, and none of the Tachibana-class. ==Matsu and Tachibana classes comparison== Matsu-class destroyer Take with Kaiten.

Eighteen of these were completed to the original Matsu design, but the other twenty-four were altered to a modified (simplified) design which became known as the Tachibana class. Eight of this batch were completed to that design, while orders for sixteen were subsequently cancelled (of which eleven had not been laid down). Another thirty-two vessels were authorised in Fiscal Year 1944 under the Wartime Naval Armaments Supplement Programme as #4801-#4832, all to the Tachibana design. Six of this batch were completed to that design, while another four were ordered and laid down but were subsequently cancelled on 17 April 1945; the remaining twenty-two were never ordered. A further eighty vessels were projected in Fiscal Year 1945 to a further modification of the design, known as the Kai-Tachibana class, but no orders were placed before the end of the war brought an end to the programme. {|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" |width=\"4%\"|Ship # |width=\"10%\"|Japanese name & translation |width=\"5%\"|Class |width=\"4%\"|Builder |width=\"6%\" bgcolor=|Laid down |width=\"6%\" bgcolor=|Launched |width=\"6%\" bgcolor=|Completed |width=\"20%\" bgcolor=|Fate |- |5481 | Pine tree | Matsu | Maizuru Naval Arsenal | 8 August 1943 | 3 February 1944 | 28 April 1944 | Sunk on 4 August 1944 by US Navy ships 50 miles northwest of Chichijima (Ogasawara Islands) |- |5482 | Bamboo | Matsu | Yokosuka Naval Arsenal | 15 October 1943 | 28 March 1944 | 16 June 1944 | Surrendered to United Kingdom on 16 July 1947 at Singapore, scrapped |- |5483 | Japanese apricot | Matsu | Fujinagata Shipyards | 25 January 1944 | 24 April 1944 | 28 June 1944 | Sunk 31 January 1945 by US Army Air Force aircraft 20 miles south of Taiwan |- |5484 | Peach | Matsu | Maizuru Naval Arsenal | 5 November 1943 | 25 March 1944 | 10 June 1944 | Sunk 15 December 1944 by US Navy submarine USS Hawkbill 140 miles south-west of m.Bolinao (o-in Luzon) |- |5485 | Mulberry | Matsu | Fujinagata Shipyards | 20 December 1943 | 25 May 1944 | 15 July 1944 | Sunk 3 December 1944 by US Navy destroyers during the Battle of Ormoc Bay (o-in Luzon) |- |5486 | Paulownia | Matsu | Yokosuka Naval Arsenal | 1 February 1944 | 27 May 1944 | 14 August 1944 | Delivered to Soviet Union on 29 July 1947 at Nakhodka, renamed Vozrozhdionny (\u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0451\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439), converted to target ship TsL-25 (1949) and depot ship PM-65 (1957), scrapped in 1969. |- |5487 | Cedar | Matsu | Fujinagata Shipyards | 25 February 1944 | 3 July 1944 | 25 August 1944 | Surrendered at Kure.
