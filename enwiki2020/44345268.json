    "text": "Nikac Tomanovi\u0107 (; 1755\u201356), known in epic poetry as Nikac of Rovine (\u041d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0446 \u043e\u0434 \u0420\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430/Nikac od Rovina), was Montenegrin haramba\u0161a in Nik\u0161i\u0107 and contemporary of Sava Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161 (1735\u20131782). ==Life== ===Primary sources=== The history of Nikac is known by poems collected by Sima Milutinovi\u0107 Sarajlija and Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161, the Prince-Bishop of Montenegro (1830\u20131851), and subsequently collected epic poems. ===Early life=== Nikac was born in Rovine, of the Sanjak of Herzegovina of the Bosnia Eyalet, Ottoman Empire (now western Montenegro). He was the son of Vuk Tomanovi\u0107, of the Cuce tribe, a contemporary of Danilo I, Metropolitan of Cetinje (1696\u20131735). Vuk was not a glavar (head) in the Montenegrin tribal assembly. The Tomanovi\u0107 hailed from Old Ku\u010di (eastern Montenegro). ===Stories=== In ca. 1750 Nikac and his 40 companions penetrated through an Ottoman army base of 30,000 men, killed the Osman-Kaiha Pasha, and Nikac succeeded, though wounded, to \"cutting his way back\" with a few surviving men. It is said that he and his 40 men came to surrender themselves to the pasha, then killed him in his own tent, like Milo\u0161 Obili\u0107 had done to the sultan. According to another story a general with 45,000 men invaded Montenegro but was defeated by vladika Vasilije Petrovi\u0107 and killed by Nikac, who gave the general's sabre to Vladika Sava. He was then sent to Dobrota, near Kotor, to heal his wounds. According to an epic poem, he murdered Odo Beg Mu\u0161ovi\u0107. Nikac took a charge of the collected hara\u00e7 (tax) to Hamza Pasha. As Nikac was feared by the Turks, Hamza accepted this. Ja\u0161ar Babi\u0107 however, disapproved, and went with his armed band to steal Nikac's livestock. Early at dawn, Nikac and Ja\u0161ar met and fired their guns at the same time, killing each other. According to another story, Nikac stops the stealing, recovers the sheep, kills thirty Turks, and takes seven or eight prisoners. ==Legacy== During his rule, vladika Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 of Montenegro wanted to establish a medal for heroism, named after Nikac. However, senators Filip \u0110ura\u0161kovi\u0107 and Stevan Vukoti\u0107 suggested that the medal be named after Milo\u0161 Obili\u0107 instead, as he had killed the sultan and Nikac killed a pasha. Therefore, the medal established in 1847 as the highest military decoration in Montenegro became known as the Obili\u0107 medal. Milutin Tomi\u0107 used the pseudonym \"Nikac od Rovina\". ==Epic poetry== *Hara\u010dlija Crnogoraca (1833) by Sima Milutinovi\u0107 *Nikac od Rovina, in The Serbian Mirror (1835) by Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 *Ovce Nikca od Rovina *Smrt Nikca od Rovina *Babi\u0107 Ja\u0161ar i Nikac od Rovaca ==References== ===Secondary sources=== * * * Category:18th-century deaths Category:Ottoman period in the history of Montenegro Category:People from Nik\u0161i\u0107 Category:Characters in Serbian epic poetry Category:Hajduks Category:Montenegrin soldiers ",
