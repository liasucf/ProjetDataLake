    "text": "James Henthorne Argue (2 June 1848 - 4 March 1927) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1899 to 1914, as a member of the Conservative Party. Argue was born in Ireland, and received a grammar school education. He worked as a farmer after moving in Manitoba, and served for fifteen years as a local reeve and councillor. In religion, he was a member of the Church of England. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1899 provincial election, defeating Liberal incumbent Thomas Dickey by seventy-seven votes in the Avondale constituency. The Conservatives won this election, and Argue served in the legislature as a government backbencher. He was re-elected in the campaigns of 1903, 1907 and 1910, and did not seek re-election in 1914. He later moved to Vancouver, where he died in 1927. His son, James O. Argue, was a Progressive Conservative member of the legislature from 1945 to 1955. ==References== Category:1848 births Category:1927 deaths Category:Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba MLAs ",
