Its scope covers basic, translational, clinical and experimental studies. The journal is published by Bioscientifica on behalf of the Society for Endocrinology. It is also an official journal of the European Society of Endocrinology and the Japanese Hormone and Cancer Society. The editor-in-chief is Charis Eng (Cleveland Clinic) and, according to the ISI Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2019 impact factor of 4.800. == History == Endocrine-Related Cancer was founded as Reviews on Endocrine- Related Cancer, the in-house journal of Zeneca (now AstraZeneca) published by its parent company ICI Pharmaceuticals. It was taken over by the Society for Endocrinology in 1994 when it was renamed, and the remit was extended to include a limited number of original research articles to complement the existing reviews. The numbers of research articles gradually increased over time. The editor-in-chief of the journal at the time of the name change and remit extension was Vivian H.T. James, who took the journal\u2019s precursor and set Endocrine-Related Cancer on a firm footing for development and expansion. Marc Lippman took over leadership in 2000 and managed the fourfold increase in published pages. He also oversaw an impact factor increase from 0.933 in 1999 to 4.597 in 2004.https://www.endocrinology.org/endocrinologist/095/095.pdf In 2006, Endocrine-Related Cancer was adopted as an official journal by the European Society of Endocrinology, in 2014 by the Endocrine Society of Australia and in 2015 by the Japan Hormone and Cancer Society. James Fagin held the role of editor-in-chief from 2006 to 2010. During this time the impact factor rose to 5.236.https://www.endocrinesociety.org.au/downloads/esa_news_april2014v5Final.pdf There were four annual issues of the journal from 1994 to 2010. From 2011 to 2015 Endocrine-Related Cancer was published bimonthly and, as of 2017, is published monthly. == Online access == Endocrine-Related Cancer was first published online in March 1998 in PDF format.
