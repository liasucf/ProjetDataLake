The tournament was held at the University of New Mexico Golf Course in Albuquerque, New Mexico. San Jose State won the team championship, the Spartans' first. Caroline Keggi, from New Mexico, won the individual title. ==Individual results== ===Individual champion=== * Caroline Keggi, New Mexico (289, \u22123) ==Team results== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! dat-sort- type=number|Rank !!
