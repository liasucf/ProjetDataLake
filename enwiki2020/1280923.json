The villages made use of varied water-catchment strategies and served the needs of Israelite Jerusalem, including as a major producer of wine and oil for use in the Temple in Jerusalem.Pisgat Ze'ev Jerusalem Municipality Three ritual baths from the Second Temple period have been excavated in Pisgat Ze'ev.Second Temple Period Ritual Baths Adjacent to Agricultural Installations The Byzantine period saw the villages' primary use shift from agriculture to service religious functions, such as churches and monasteries. A large monastery from the period was located at the site's highest point, Ras at-Tawill. The monastery was likely active from the end of the 5th century to the close of the 8th century, and included a mosaic-floored chapel above a burial cave, as well as an oil press and a cloth bag of 200 coins. An oven and pots from the Iron Age were also found nearby. An archaeological site known as Deir Ghazali (the Deer Monastery) was also excavated in eastern Pisgat Ze\u2019ev.Heritage conservation in Israel:Maintaining Antiquities Sites in the Western Part of the City Overlooking the neighborhood is Tell el-Ful, believed to be the capital of the Tribe of Judah and site of the Israelite King Saul's palace.

Most of the landowners died in the Holocaust. The land was later expropriated along with Palestinian land to build Pisgat Ze'ev.Much of Pisgat Ze'ev built on land bought by Jews who died in the Holocaust, Haaretz Pisgat Ze'ev was established in 1982 on land annexed to Israel after the 1967 Six-Day War as one of the city's five Ring Neighborhoods, meant to create a contiguous Jewish link with Neve Yaakov in the city's north, which had been isolated from other Jewish areas. The original name proposal was \"Pisgat Tal,\" based on the Arabic name of the hilltop where construction was to begin, Ras at-Tawill, but the final choice was Pisgat Ze'ev, after the Revisionist Zionist leader, Ze'ev Jabotinsky. According to ARIJ, Israel confiscated land from several surrounding Palestinian communities in order to construct Pisgat Ze'ev: *1,458 dunams from Beit Hanina,Beit Hanina Town Profile, 2013, pp. 13-14 *686 dunams from Beit Hanina for the Pisgat Amir neighbourhood in Pisgat Ze'ev, *239 dunams from Shuafat,Shu\u2019fat Town Profile, 2013 p. 14 *89 dunams from Hizma.Hizma Village Profile, 2012, p. 17 In May 2003, a public bus leaving the Pisgat Ze'ev terminus was blown up by a Palestinian suicide bomber.
