    "text": "Russell Miller Faulkinberry (November 3, 1928 \u2013 November 16, 2005) was an American football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at the University of Southwestern Louisiana\u2014now known as the University of Louisiana at Lafayette\u2014from 1961 to 1973, compiling a record of 66\u201363\u20132. Faulkinberry played college football as a tackle at Vanderbilt University from 1947 to 1950. As a senior, he was captain of the 1950 Vanderbilt Commodores football team and was named to the 1950 All-SEC football team. Faulkinberry was an assistant coach at Southeastern Louisiana University, Iowa State University, Texas A&M; University, and the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln before he was hired at Southwestern Louisiana. He died on November 16, 2005 after a long illness. Faulkinberry's tenure brought about the change of Southwestern Louisiana's fight name from the \"Bulldogs\" to the \"Raging Cajuns\". One of his assistant coaches once remarked, \"Go out there and rage like a bunch of Cajuns!\" The phrase stuck both because a majority of the players were from south Louisiana and because fans, students, and alumni loved the phrase. Later on, the University of Southwestern Louisiana trademarked the phrase and, to this day, the sports teams are known as the \"Ragin' Cajuns.\" ==Military service== Faulkinberry served in the United States Navy during the Korean War. ==Death== Faulkinberry died on November 16, 2005, in Lafayette, Louisiana, at the age of 77. He was buried in Lafayette Memorial Park. ==Head coaching record== ==References== ==External links== * Category:1928 births Category:2005 deaths Category:American football tackles Category:Iowa State Cyclones football coaches Category:Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns football coaches Category:Nebraska Cornhuskers football coaches Category:Southeastern Louisiana Lions football coaches Category:Texas A&M; Aggies football coaches Category:Vanderbilt Commodores football players Category:People from Murfreesboro, Tennessee ",
