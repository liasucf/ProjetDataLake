A clasp to the Award was subsequently instituted.New Zealand Defence Force - The Air Efficiency Award Royal Warrant - Amendment dated 12 April 1951 (Accessed 2 August 2015) Since, at the time, the Air Efficiency Award was unique, being a decoration which could be conferred on officers and other ranks alike in recognition of the unique relationship between the officers and men of an aircraft crew, recipients were initially not granted the right to use post-nominal letters. The use of the post-nominal letters \"AE\" was only approved at some date between 27 October 1964 and 28 October 1982, and only in respect of officer recipients.TheyWorkForYou - \"Air Efficiency Award - Oral Answers to Questions - Royal Air Force - In the House of Commons at 12:00 am on 14th October 1942\" (Accessed 3 August 2015)The London Gazette: no. 43474. p. 9123. 27 October 1964 (Accessed on 3 August 2015)The London Gazette: no. 49522. pp. 14201-14202. 28 October 1983 (Accessed on 3 August 2015) Several Dominions adopted the Air Efficiency Award. * In Australia, approximately 400 Air Efficiency Awards were made between 1942 and 1975. * In Canada, the Air Efficiency Award was adopted in 1942 and, in respect of part-time officers, airmen and airwomen of the Royal Canadian Air Force Auxiliary and the Auxiliary Active Air Force Reserve, replaced the Efficiency Decoration and Efficiency Medal. It was originally planned that the Canadian version of the medal would have a bar inscribed \"CANADA\" on the suspension, but this never materialised and the regular British version was awarded to Canadians.National Defence and the Canadian Forces - Obsolete Long Service Awards - Royal Canadian Air Force Auxiliary and Auxiliary Active Air Force (Accessed on 3 August 2015)Veterans Affairs Canada - Air Efficiency Award (Accessed 3 August 2015) * New Zealand adopted the Air Efficiency Award in 1942 and still awards it. * South Africa adopted it and, in 1950, intended to introduce a bilingual version, with a scroll bar similar to that of the Efficiency Medal (South Africa) above the suspender and the inscriptions \"AIR EFFICIENCY AWARD\" and \"TOEKENNING VIR BEKWAAMHEID (LUGMAG)\" on the reverse. This version also never materialised since, on 6 April 1952, a set of South African decorations and medals were instituted to replace all the British awards hitherto used.Profile of a Research Project: The Medal Publications of the South African National Museum of Military History. Dr Stanley Monick, curator of medals and numismatics of the South African National Museum of Military History (c. 1991). pp. 36-37 (Accessed 2 August 2015)South African Medal Website - Union Defence Forces (1939-52) (Accessed 2 August 2015) The first conferments of the Air Efficiency Award were announced in the press on 25 December 1942.Trove - Air Efficiency Award - The First Recipients (Accessed 3 August 2015) ==Award criteria== The period of reckoned service required to qualify for the award was ten years, of which at least five years of actual service had to have been in an Auxiliary or Volunteer Air Force of the United Kingdom or the Dominions, Colonies, Protectorates, India or Burma. The award could also be made to any Princes or Princesses of the Blood Royal. The period of reckoned service required to qualify for the award of the clasp was a further ten years, subject to the same conditions as for the award of the medal. Further clasps could be awarded upon completion of each additional ten years of qualifying service.New Zealand Defence Force - The Air Efficiency Award Regulations 1954 For those airmen and airwomen whose service commenced before 3 September 1939, the time served was reckoned as time-and-a-half. Service on flying duties with the Royal Air Force or any other Commonwealth Air Force during the Second World War between 3 September 1939 and 2 September 1945 was reckoned as treble time. Service on other than flying duties was normally reckoned as single time, but while embodied within the Royal Air Force or any Commonwealth Air Force during the Second World War, such service was reckoned as double time. For service which commenced after 1 December 1948, service in a flying category was reckoned as time-and-a-half, while service in other than a flying category was reckoned as single time. ==Order of wear== In the order of wear prescribed by the British Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, the Air Efficiency Award takes precedence after the Royal Naval Auxiliary Service Medal and before the Volunteer Reserves Service Medal. ===South Africa=== With effect from 6 April 1952, when a new South African set of decorations and medals was instituted to replace the British awards used to date, the older British decorations and medals which were applicable to South Africa continued to be worn in the same order of precedence but, with the exception of the Victoria Cross, took precedence after all South African decorations and medals awarded to South Africans on or after that date. Of the official British medals which were applicable to South Africans, the Air Efficiency Award takes precedence as shown.Republic of South Africa Government Gazette Vol. 477, no. 27376, Pretoria, 11 March 2005, Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve Long Service and Good Conduct Medal Air Efficiency Award Union of South Africa Commemoration Medal * Preceded by the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. * Succeeded by the Union of South Africa Commemoration Medal. ==Description== The medal was struck in silver and is oval, high and wide, with a raised rim on each side.
