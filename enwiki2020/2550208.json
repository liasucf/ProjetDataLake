    "text": "Fluacizine, sold under the brand name Phtorazisin, is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) of the phenothiazine group which is or was marketed in Russia. Unlike other phenothiazines, fluacizine is not an antipsychotic, and can actually reverse catalepsy and extrapyramidal symptoms induced by antidopaminergic agents like antipsychotics, reserpine, and tetrabenazine as well as potentiate amphetamine-induced stereotypy. It is known to act as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, antihistamine, and anticholinergic. The drug was developed in the 1960s and was marketed in the 1970s. It is the trifluoromethyl analogue of chloracizine. ==See also== * Pipofezine ==References== Category:Abandoned drugs Category:Diethylamino compounds Category:Antidepressants Category:Carboxamides Category:Drugs in the Soviet Union Category:H1 receptor antagonists Category:Muscarinic antagonists Category:Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors Category:Phenothiazines Category:Russian drugs Category:Trifluoromethyl compounds ",
