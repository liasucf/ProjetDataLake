In perceptual illusions: *Beta movement, an illusion of movement where two or more still images are combined by the brain into surmised motion. *Illusory motion, the appearance of movement in a static image. *Phi phenomenon, an illusion of movement created when two or more adjacent lights blink on and off in succession. *Stroboscopic effect, a phenomenon that occurs when continuous motion is represented by a series of short or instantaneous samples. **Wagon-wheel effect, temporal aliasing effect in which a spoked wheel appears to rotate differently from its true rotation. Other uses: *Optical flow, a term used in computer science for the apparent motion of objects in a scene caused by the relative motion between an observer and the scene *The motion of objects observed from a non-inertial reference frame ",
