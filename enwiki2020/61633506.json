He was part of the FC Porto squad that won the 2018\u201319 UEFA Youth League, defeating Chelsea 3\u20131 in the final in Nyon, Switzerland. With a contract lasting until 2021, he attracted interest from Manchester City who offered \u20ac10 million for his signature, and rejected a transfer to FC Barcelona in August 2019. Ahead of the 2019\u201320 season, Esteves was given the number 2 shirt for the first team, inherited from the released Maxi Pereira. He made his senior debut on 18 August 2019 for FC Porto B, starting and playing 80 minutes in a 1\u20131 home draw against Varzim S.C. on the second week of the season. Esteves had his initial call-up to a first-team matchday squad for the Ta\u00e7a da Liga opening group match against C.D. Santa Clara on 25 September 2019, remaining unused in the 1\u20130 home win. On 5 December he made his debut in the same competition, playing the last 15 minutes of a 3\u20130 win at Casa Pia A.C. in place of Wilson Manaf\u00e1. He made his Primeira Liga bow on 16 June 2020, playing the first hour of a goalless draw at bottom club C.D. Aves before being substituted for Moussa Marega. On 5 October 2020, Esteves was loaned to EFL Championship club Reading for the season. ==International career== Esteves first represented Portugal at under-15 level in April 2017. On 5 September 2019, he made his debut for the under-21 team, replacing Thierry Correia at half time in a 5\u20130 home win over Gibraltar in Alverca in a Euro 2021 qualifier. At 17 years, 5 months and 3 days he became the youngest player for the team in the 21st century, beating fellow Porto graduate R\u00faben Neves by 25 days. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals !Apps!!Goals !Apps!!Goals !Apps!!Goals !Apps!!Goals !Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Porto B |2019\u201320 |rowspan=\"1\"|LigaPro |10||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||10||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Porto |2019\u201320 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primeira Liga |2||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||3||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !12!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!13!!0 |} ==Honours== Porto *Primeira Liga: 2019\u201320 ;Porto Youth *UEFA Youth League: 2018\u201319 ==References== ==External links== * * *National team data at FPF Category:2002 births Category:Living people Category:People from Arcos de Valdevez Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Portugal under-21 international footballers Category:Portugal youth international footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Primeira Liga players Category:LigaPro players Category:FC Porto players Category:FC Porto B players Category:Reading F.C. players Category:Portuguese expatriate footballers Category:Portuguese expatriate sportspeople in England Category:Expatriate footballers in England ",
