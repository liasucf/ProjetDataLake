The team is headquartered at the Sher-e-Bangla Cricket Stadium in Mirpur, and so is one of three teams playing in the city, alongside the Dhaka Division cricket team and Dhaka Metropolis cricket team which are active in first-class cricket. The team was originally established in 2012 for the inaugural BPL season as the Dhaka Gladiators and they won both the 2012 and 2013 editions of the tournament. The Gladiators were one of the teams dissolved in 2013 after the second edition.

During their third victory against Barisal Burners, they made the highest total of the tournament by scoring 208 runs for five wickets.

In the Eliminator they defeated Chittagong Vikings and defeated Rangpur Riders in the Qualifier 2 to seal their place in the Final. In the final Comilla Victorians set a target of 200 for Dhaka, but they fell short by 17 runs in their chase and Comilla won the tournament for the second time.
