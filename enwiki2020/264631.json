    "text": "Wikiquote is one of a family of wiki-based projects run by the Wikimedia Foundation, running on MediaWiki software. Based on an idea by Daniel Alston and implemented by Brion Vibber, the goal of the project, which began as an outgrowth to Wikipedia Famous Quotations, is to produce collaboratively a vast reference of quotations from prominent people, books, films, proverbs, etc. and to be as proper as possible in regard to the details of the quotations and also providing the appropriate human reference of the quotation. Initially, the project was created solely in English in July 2003; a later expansion to include additional languages was started in July 2004. As of , there are active Wikiquote sites for languagesWikimedia's MediaWiki API:Sitematrix.

The University of Wroclaw team entering Conversational Intelligence Challenge of the 2017 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017) used Wikiquote to produce a conversational talker module for extraction of rare words. ==Reception== Wikiquote has been suggested as \"a great starting point for a quotation search\" with only quotes with sourced citations being available. It is also noted as a source from frequent misquotes and their possible origins. It can be used for analysis to produce claims such as \"Albert Einstein is probably the most quoted figure of our time\". == See also == *meta:List of Wikiquotes *Wikimedia Foundation *Wiktionary == References == ==External links== * Category:Internet properties established in 2003 Category:Multilingual websites Category:Quotations Category:Wikimedia projects Category:Advertising-free websites ",
