He published numerous articles and books, mainly in the areas of history and literature. ==Life== Browne was born in Stouts Hill, Uley, Gloucestershire, England, the son of civil engineer Benjamin Chapman Browne and his wife, Annie. He was educated at Trinity College, Glenalmond, Burnside's School in Berkshire, Eton College, and the Newcastle College of Physical Science. He then read natural sciences at Pembroke College, Cambridge. He also studied Arabic with Edward Henry Palmer and William Wright, Persian with Edward Byles Cowell, and Turkish with Sir James Redhouse, motivated by an interest in the Turkish people. After graduating in 1882 he travelled to Constantinople. Browne then spent a further two years at University of Cambridge studying the languages of India (defined then as Hindustani, Sanskrit, Persian, and Arabic) and also gained an M.B. in London.Buck, Christopher. \u201cEdward Granville Browne.\u201d British Writers, Supplement XXI. Ed. Jay Parini. Farmington Hills, MI: Charles Scribner\u2019s Sons/The Gale Group, 2014. Pp. 17\u201333. In 1887 he was made a Fellow of Pembroke, and then paid an extended visit to Iran. He returned to become university lecturer in Persian. In April 1902 he was elected Sir Thomas Adams's Professor of Arabic at the University of Cambridge. Browne was mainly responsible for the creation at Cambridge of a school of living languages of Asia, in connection with the training of candidates for the Egyptian and Sudanese civil services, and the Lebanese consular service. He was on his sixtieth birthday the recipient of a large Festschrift.A Volume of Oriental Studies Presented to Edward G. Browne, M.A., M.B., F.B.A., F.R.C.P., Sir Thomas Adam's Professor of Arabic in the University of Cambridge on the 60th Birthday (7 February 1922), ed. by T. W. Arnold and Reynold A. Nicholson (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1922). ==Family== Browne married Alice Caroline, daughter of Francis Henry Blackburne Daniell in 1906, and had two sons. He died in 1926 in Cambridge. ==Works== Browne published in areas which few other Western scholars had explored. Many of his publications are related to Iran, either in the fields of history or Persian literature. He is perhaps best known for his documentation and historical narratives of B\u00e1bism as relayed by Arthur de Gobineau. He published two translations of B\u00e1b\u00ed histories, and wrote several of the few Western accounts of early B\u00e1b\u00ed and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed history. Browne was not a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed, but rather an Orientalist. His interest in the B\u00e1b\u00ed movement was piqued by a book by de Gobineau found while he was looking for materials on tasawwuf. The history A Traveller's Narrative was written by `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 and translated by Browne, who added a large introduction and appendices. Browne was fascinated by the development of the written historical perspectives of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds regarding successorship after the B\u00e1b including their idea of an independent dispensation of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h. These Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed-authored works emphasized Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h to a greater extent than the B\u00e1b and took a critical view against Subh-i-Azal, whom Arthur de Gobineau listed as the B\u00e1b's successor. Browne expressed sympathy for Subh-i-Azal and surprise at the route the religion had taken. About the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed teachings he says: In A Year Among the Persians (1893) he wrote a sympathetic portrayal of Persian society. After his death in 1926 it was reprinted and became a classic in English travel literature. He also published the first volume of A Literary History of Persia in 1902 with subsequent volumes in 1906, 1920, and 1924. It remains a standard authority. Among Iranians, Browne is well remembered today. A street named after him in Tehran, as well as his statue, remained even after the Iranian Revolution in 1979. ==Bibliography== Works by Browne *Religious Systems of the World: A Contribution to the Study of Comparative Religion (1889) *A Traveller's Narrative: Written to illustrate the episode of the Bab (1891) *A Year Among the Persians (1893) *A chapter from the history of Cannabis Indica (1897) *A Literary History of Persia (1908) *The Persian Revolution of 1905\u20131909 (1910) *Materials for the Study of the Babi Religion (1918) *Arabian Medicine(1921) ==Notes== ==References== * *Ross, Christopher N.
