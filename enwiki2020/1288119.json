    "text": "Peel station is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Ville-Marie in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.Peel Metro Station It is operated by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de transport de Montr\u00e9al (STM) and serves the Green Line. The station opened on October 14, 1966, as part of the original network of the Metro. ==Architecture and art== Ceramic Circle by Jean-Paul Mousseau. The interior of Peel station and its floating mezzanine. Designed by Papineau, G\u00e9rin-Lajoie, and Leblanc, it is a normal side platform station, built in open-cut under boul. De Maisonneuve. Its mezzanine floats within the open-cut volume, supported by pillars and beams, and contains ticket barriers at either end with the fare- paid zone in the centre. There are two entrances at the west end of the station, one with shops and services, and three at the east end, including underground city access to Les Cours Mont-Royal and points east. All of the street entrances are integrated into other buildings. A circular theme is present throughout the station's decor: there are bright single color circles on light panels surrounding the advertising posters, circles in the marble of one entrance, circular tiles on the floor and walls, but the best-known works of art in the station, and the main artwork, are a series of 54 large circles (of which 37 remain) by Jean-Paul Mousseau, one of the few artworks to be integrated into the architecture of the original network rather than commissioned later. Created in collaboration with ceramist Claude Vermette, these circles, set in floors and walls throughout the station, are mainly in tones of orange or blue streaked with other colors. A sculpture by Maurice Lemieux entitled Enterspace stands outside the Peel Nord entrance. ==Origin of the name== Tunnels at Peel. The station is named for Peel Street, which in turn was named for Sir Robert Peel, British Prime Minister from 1834 to 1835 and again from 1841 to 1846. He is best known for creating London's police department while Home Secretary, thus giving them their nickname of \"Bobbies.\" ==Connecting bus routes== {| align=center class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"background: #; font-size:100%; color:#FFFFFF;\"| |- !
