    "text": "Robert Vischer (22 February 1847, T\u00fcbingen \u2013 25 March 1933, Vienna) was a German philosopher who invented the term Einf\u00fchlung (esthetic sympathy, later translated in English as empathy), which was to be promoted by Theodor Lipps, Freud's admired philosopher. ==Vischer\u2019s use of Einf\u00fchlung== Vischer postulated the as yet undescribed distinction between verstehen and Einf\u00fchlung (\u201cin-feeling\u201d or \u201cfeeling-into\u201d) in his 1873 doctoral thesis On the Optical Sense of Form: A Contribution to Aesthetics. In It was the first mention of the word Einf\u00fchlung in this form in print. His more-famous father, Friedrich Theodor Vischer, had used the term Einf\u00fchlen in explorations of Idealism relative to architectural form, and related concepts were certainly already in the air. Indeed, the phrase \"sich einf\u00fchlen\" was used by Herder in the 18th century. Nonetheless, Robert Vischer's exploration was the first significant discussion of the concept of Einf\u00fchlung under that precise name.Mallgrave and Ikonomou, (1994). \"Introduction\", pp. 1-85. ==Notes== Category:1933 deaths Category:1847 births Category:German philosophers Category:German male writers ",
