Cardozo School of Law, Yeshiva University. \"Class of 2016 Celebrates Commencement, May 31, 2016.\" He taught contracts, legal ethics and Land Use and Zoning at the Cardozo School of Law. He is the author of a book, Lawyer Barons: What Their Contingency Fees Really Cost America (Cambridge University Press, 2011), a detailed critique of perceived abuses and excessive costs of the American tort system, with proposals for reform. Brickman is a graduate of Carnegie Mellon University. He holds a juris doctor degree from the University of Florida and an LLM degree from Yale Law School. Professor Brickman has written on asbestos litigation and tort reform. Brickman, with co-authors Jeffrey O'Connell and Michael Horowitz,Brickman, L. and H. D.

Another area in which his reform efforts have been successful is that of nonrefundable retainers. After Brickman and his former student Lawrence Cunningham wrote several law review articles and an amicus curiae brief arguing that they are ethically and legally impermissible, the New York Court of Appeals struck down their use by lawyers in New York State. This holding has been adopted in other states.Brickman, L. and Lawrence Cunningham (1988). \"Nonrefundable retainers: impermissible under fiduciary, statutory and contract law.\" Fordham Law Review 57(2): 149-190.Brickman, L. and Lawrence A.

Brickman played a significant role as an expert witness in a controversial 2013 case in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, In Re Garlock Sealing Technologies, LLC., et al., debtor. Counsel for Garlock, Garland Cassada of the Charlotte NC law firm Robinson, Bradshaw & Hinson, was successful in persuading Judge George Hodges to permit full discovery of 15 high-value asbestos claims settled by Garlock when it was a solvent entity. Using data obtained from these cases by Cassada, Professor Brickman's expert report set forth evidence of fraud, misrepresentation and \"double-dipping\" (contradictory accounts of exposure between tort and bankruptcy-trust claims) in all 15 cases, the net effect of which was to inflate the value of future claims that may be made against the bankrupt entity.Gvillo, Heather Isringhausen. \"A Look at Two Rulings $1B Apart in Bankruptcy Proceedings of Garlock, Bondex.\" Legal Newsline (August 12, 2014).Fisher, Daniel. \"A Stubborn Manufacturer Exposes the Asbestos Blame Game.\" Forbes (March 25, 2015).Tomsic, Michael. \"In Charlotte, Judge Describes Asbestos Litigation 'Infected with the Impropriety of Some Law Firms'.\" WFAE 90.7 (January 23, 2014). The claimants, represented by the Garlock Asbestos Claims Committee, had estimated that future liability as high as $1.3 billion. Judge Hodges, in his January 10, 2014 \"Order Estimating Aggregate Liability,\" reduced the amount required for the bankruptcy trust by more than $1 billion, to $125 million, asserting that: > The purpose of this Order is to determine Garlock's responsibility for > causing mesothelioma and the aggregate amount of money that is required to > satisfy its liability to present claimants and future victims. The estimates > of Garlock's aggregate liability that are based on its historic settlement > values are not reliable because those values are infected with the > impropriety of some law firms and inflated by the cost of defense.

Charlotte NC, 2014. In his teaching, Brickman employed a very rigorous Socratic method during class meetings, combining a fast-paced banter with students leavened along the way by his idiosyncratic phrases and original anecdotes, frequently using his catchphrases \"make a legal noise\" or \"difference in degree or difference in kind\". The overall effect was intended to scare students into closer reading of case texts (a la the character Professor Kingsfield in The Paper Chase).On this point, see \"Review & Comment\" [editorial] Cardozo Law Forum 6, no. 1 (February 21, 1984): 2. See also \"Give It a Rest\" [letter to the editor], Cardozo Law Forum 7, no. 1 (May 1, 1984): 2. He has referred to the school's namesake jurist Benjamin N.

Available from Carnegie Institute of Technology and Carnegie-Mellon University digital collections.. In his freshman year at Carnegie Tech, in April 1958, Brickman published an article sharply criticizing his own public-school secondary education in Carnegie Technical, an undergraduate opinion magazine, thinly disguising the name of the high school as \"Marlin Boom.\"Brickman, Lester. \"Education at Marlin Boom.\" Carnegie Technical Magazine 22, no. 5 (April, 1958): 39-42.

All references in this paragraph available from Carnegie Institute of Technology and Carnegie-Mellon University digital collections.. In an early harbinger of his later logomachies in print, Brickman launched a campaign in 1960 to convince the Carnegie Tech Men's Dormitory Council of the manifest injustice of permitting Carnegie Tech's women students only two dorm-room visits per year to the Council's \"protectorate,\" the men's dormitories in which Brickman was a resident and counselor. Predictably, this effort drew the published ire of the target organization.Brickman, Lester. \"Maturity.\" Carnegie Tartan 52, no. 22 (April 27, 1960): 4 and 7. James R. Powers, then President of the Council, reviled Brickman's progressive position on opposite-sex visitation to male residence halls in a student-newspaper op-ed, saying of him that \"This notorious gentleman of recent Thistle reorganization fame has taken it upon himself to be the conscience of Carnegie Tech\" and to be the \"self-chosen liberator of the masses of Tech students.\"Powers, \"Open House,\" 4. At this period, women comprised about 10 per cent of Carnegie Tech's student body. Their visits to the quarters of the opposite sex remained restricted for the rest of the decade.\"CMU--About--History,\" , accessed 18 August 2016.

The following summer at the Miami Beach law firm of Sibley, Giblin, King & Levenson was to be Brickman's only experience in the practice of law in his long career. He returned to academe at the end of the summer, on a Sterling Fellowship to Yale University, where he earned a Master of Laws (LL.M.) degree in 1965. By the fall term of 1965, Brickman was an assistant professor at the University of Toledo College of Law. ==Academic career== ===University of Toledo College of Law=== Brickman's eleven years at the University of Toledo College of Law, as an assistant professor (1965-1968), associate professor (1968-1971) and full professor (1971-1976), were the central component of what he was later to call his \"liberal days,\" when much of his work focused on social justice, poverty law,\"Social Concerns: Legal Needs of Poor New TU Course; Ford Foundation Funding Program.\" Toledo Blade, 1967, 23. urban housing and zoning,\"Code Violators; Housing School for Tenants Urged; Safe, Sanitary Homes Is Goal.\" Toledo Blade, December 21, 1967, 27; and \"Substandard Housing: Advice Asked on Tenant Problems; Council Undecided on Proper Action.\" Toledo Blade, March 21, 1968, 33. campaign finance reform,Reed, Judith. \"Panel Disagrees on Financing of Political Campaigns.\" Toledo Blade, October 3, 1973, 15. living conditions for migrant workers,\"No Action Is Taken on Migrant Showers; Legislative Steps by State Urged; Plumbers Strike, Funds Lack Cited.\" Toledo Blade, July 25, 1968, 21. youth employment, and racial and gender equality.

He published five more articles in 1975, his last year in Toledo, including two advocating a reduction of restrictions on lawyer advertising (see list of publications below). Brickman wrote of his time in Toledo soon after taking up his position on the faculty at Cardozo in New York City, in the recently-established University of Toledo Law Review, on the occasion of Karl Krastin's (1910-1998) retirement from the institution.Obituary: Karl Krastin.\" Toledo Blade, August 18, 1998, 14. He recalled the \"'go-go' reputation about the law school at Toledo. It was looked upon as a place where much was happening; where there was much intellectual ferment and movement toward excellence.\"Winkler, Jim. \"UT Law Review Celebrates 40th Birthday.\" University of Toledo College of Law Transcript (Fall 2009): 12. ===Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University=== There was plenty of ferment, intellectual and otherwise, at the newly founded Cardozo when Brickman returned to his native city in 1976.Carnegie Institute of Technology.

Paulsen, 1918-1981.\" Cardozo Law Review 2 (1980-81): xi. The first dozen or so full-time Cardozo faculty members, a third of whom were women, were building a law school at Yeshiva University from scratch, establishing a law review by 1979 and designing an innovative curriculum that reflected the school's urban location in the nation's largest city. The Class of 1979 consisted of 300 students, of whom nearly half were women, reflecting the progressive agenda that had recruited women to the founding faculty. Competition for students, however, was keen, and ethnic and racial diversity difficult to achieve. Cardozo alumni from these early years reported chronically malfunctioning elevators, construction noises during bar examinations, and constant efforts to stretch resources to meet urgent needs.Goldenberg, Gary. \"In the Spirit of Cardozo: The Founding of the Law School.\" Cardozo Life (2002): 10-22.\"Menopausal Brookdale Center,\" Cardozo Law Forum v.4 no.3 (11 March 1981): 13.

Lester Brickman, who was 40 in the fall of 1980, and in the process of becoming a father for the second time, reluctantly accepted the acting deanship of the struggling school, admitting later that he had been carrying much of the administrative burden since his arrival. \"It was very hard on the students,\" he reported in 2002. \"We didn't have a registrar. We didn't have a business manager. The associate dean was a part-time position. We had no budget. We did not have the infrastructure of a law school.\"Goldenberg, \"In the Spirit of Cardozo: The Founding of the Law School,\" 26.Brickman, Lester. \"Brickman on Cardozo.\" Cardozo Law Forum 4, no. 5 (April 29, 1981): 12.

Brickman learned, three days before the accreditation team's site visit, that the paperwork for the crucial procedure was incomplete. He said of this later that \"If we had not gotten our accreditation, or if it had been postponed, half our student body would have transferred, faculty would have left, and we would have been permanently barred from the upper echelon of law schools.\"Contemporaneous views of these concerns from the Cardozo Law Forum student newspaper include Yatvin, Alan L. \"Fall Inspection by ABA; Still No Request by Brickman to Upgrade Status.\" Cardozo Law Forum 4, no. 3 (March 11, 1981): 1 and 9. \"ABA Gives Ok; Accreditation Confirmation Likely.\" Cardozo Law Forum 5, no. 2 (December 1, 1981): 1;Yatvin, Alan L. \"ABA Grants Cardozo Final Accreditation.\" Cardozo Law Forum 5, no. 3 (January 27, 1982): 1, and \"Final Accreditation Means ...\" on pp.6-7 of the same issue; Cardozo Law Forum 5, no. 3 (January 27, 1982): 6-7.

His emergency-management challenges were not over, however. The Cardozo's liberal origins and left-leaning faculty had attracted a significant contingent of what Brickman later called \"Berkeley '60s-type students.\" He recounted to Gary Goldenberg in 2002 that the editors of the student newspaper \"and others had decided that the law school was not sufficiently diverse.\"\"We're All White.\" Cardozo Law Forum 4, no. 2 (December 10, 1980): 4.

The Cardozo offered him the deanship on a permanent basis, but Brickman declined, remarking later both that he felt the school would be more successful with leadership brought in from outside, and that the acting deanship had been \"an enormous strain on me personally.\" Monroe E. Price, a former law school faculty member of the University of California at Los Angeles, succeeded him as dean in July 1982, concluding what Gary Goldenberg dubbed \"the Brickman interregnum.\"Yeshiva U.

The overwhelming demands of the Cardozo's early struggles on Brickman's intellectual resources and personal energies are reflected in his curriculum vitae, which lists no publications at all in the years 1977 through 1987, the longest such gap in his career since his first publication as a college freshman in 1958.\"Lester Brickman\" [curriculum vitae], April 2016. In 1976, Brickman's first year at the Cardozo, four publications by him had appeared, including a co-authored and edited issue of conference proceedings with Richard O.

Cunningham, George Washington University Brickman wrote a critique of what was then a relatively common, although controversial, practice by attorneys, the use of nonrefundable retainers. \"A nonrefundable retainer,\" he and his co-author wrote, \"is an agreement between lawyer and client providing for the payment of part or all of the fee in advance of the lawyer's performance. The payment is designated in the retainer agreement as nonrefundable. The dispute regarding the validity of these agreements usually arises when the client terminates the lawyer's employment without just cause before completions of the tasks and demands return of the unearned part of the advance fee.\"Brickman, Lester, and Lawrence A. Cunningham. \"Nonrefundable Retainers: Impermissible under Fiduciary, Statutory and Contract Law.\" Fordham Law Review 57, no. 2 (November 1988): 150 n.1. Brickman and Cunningham argued that such agreements violate the fundamental right of the client freely to discharge the attorney.McShea, Sarah Diane. \"Non-Refundable Fees: Pitfalls & Safe Harbors.\" New York Legal Ethics Reporter (December 1, 2002). In 1993, the authors made this argument in an amici curiae brief in the Matter of Cooperman (83 NY2d 465), in which a New York lawyer named Edward M. Cooperman had been warned twice by the Grievance Committee for the Tenth Judicial District against agreements in which the lawyer demanded thousands of dollars in retainers, did little significant work, and declined to return any part of the retainers.Brickman and Cunningham. Amicus Brief in the Matter of Cooperman, 83 N.Y.2d 465 (N.Y. Court of Appeals 1993, (1993). The Appellate Division, which heard the grievance proceedings, suspended Cooperman from practice for two years. The New York State Court of Appeals, citing, among other legal authorities, Brickman and Cunningham's work on the highly questionable ethics of nonrefundable retainers, upheld the lower court's decision.Matter of Cooperman, 83 N.Y.2d 465 (N.Y. Ct. App. 1994). (Decided March 17, 1994) The court cited Brickman and Cunningham's \"Nonrefundable Retainers Revisited.\" North Carolina Law Review 72, no. 1 (1993): 6. Other state courts soon followed their example, despite opposition from some legal scholars and practicing attorneys.See, for example, Lubet, Steven. \"The Rush to Remedies: Some Conceptual Questions about Nonrefundable Retainers.\" North Carolina Law Review 73 (1994). Brickman and Cunningham responded to Lubet and other critics in their \"Nonrefundable Retainers: A Response to Critics of the Absolute Ban.\" University of Cincinnati Law Review 64, no. 1 (1995): 11; and their \"Living with the Ban on Nonrefundable Retainers: Cooperman's Scope, Meaning and Consequences\" New York State Bar Journal 66, no. 6 (1994): 50. One of the latter, criminal defense attorney Scott H. Greenfield, who criticized the Cooperman decision in a 2008 blog, drew attention to Brickman's academic status, opining that the professor \"never met a practicing lawyer he didn't hate.\"Greenfield, Scott H. \"Nonrefundable No More.\" In Simple Justice: a Criminal Defense Blog, December 2008. ===Contingent fees and effective hourly rates=== In the late 1980s and early 1990s, much of Professor Brickman's scholarship, like his critique of nonrefundable retainers, focused on ethical and economic issues associated with lawyers' fees, topics to which he was to return many times in the following decades, including in his 2011 book, Lawyer Barons. Brickman argues that plaintiff attorney fees have increased significantly over the last half- century, especially the contingent fees in class actions and mass torts, imposing substantial transaction costs on the economy, as well as incentives for fraud by attorneys and their clients.Examples include his \"Contingent Fees without Contingencies: Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark?\". UCLA Law Review 37, no. 1 (October 1989): 29-138; \"Contingency Fee Abuses, Ethical Mandates, and the Disciplinary System: The Case against Case-by-Case Enforcement.\" Washington and Lee Law Review 53, no. 4 (1996): 1339-80; \"Contingency Fees: A Peril to Nation's Health.\" Corpus Christi Caller Times, August 22, 1997; \"Limiting Lawyers' Unearned Windfall Fees.\" New York Law Journal (August 4, 1994): 5; Rethinking Contingency Fees: A Proposal to Align the Contingency Fee System with Its Policy Roots and Ethical Mandates (with Michael J. Horowitz, and Jeffrey O'Connell). Washington, D.C.: Manhattan Institute, 1994; \"The James Gang Robbed Banks. Today's Lawyers Have a Better Idea.\" St. Louis Post- Dispatch, April 27, 2001, C17; \"Market for Contingent Fee-Financed Tort Litigation: Is It Price Competitive?\" Cardozo Law Review 25, no. 1 (November 2003): 65-128; and \"Will Legal Ethics Go up in Smoke?\" Wall Street Journal, June 16, 1998, A18. Terry Carter wrote of Professor Brickman in a 1997 article in the ABA Journal that \"he is known as something of a conservative pit bull chewing on contingency fee abuse.\"Carter, Terry. \"Keepin 'Em Honest: A Professor Who Crusaded against Contingency Abuses Puts a Tax Form Proposal before Congress.\" ABA Journal (August 1997): 8. The traditional arguments in favor of the contingent fee system in American law are that 1) they permit access to the legal system for those who cannot afford to pay a lawyer, and 2) they provide incentives for attorneys to work diligently for plaintiffs, as they will be paid only if they win the case.Kritzer, Herbert M. Risks, Reputations, and Rewards: Contingency Fee Legal Practice in the United States. Stanford, Calif.: Stanford Law and Politics, 2004; Karsten, Peter. \"Enabling the Poor to Have Their Day in Court: The Sanctioning of Contingency Fee Contracts, a History to 1940.\" DePaul Law Review 47 (1998): 231-60; and MacKinnon, Frederick B. Contingent Fees for Legal Services; a Study of Professional Economics and Responsibilities. Chicago: Aldine Pub. Co. for American Bar Association, 1964. Advocates of the contingent fee argue that the lawyers' fee of 25 to 40 per cent of the recovery is necessarily high because of the risk of losing cases. Professor Brickman has asserted, in more than a dozen articles since 1989, that plaintiff attorneys generally do not accept cases that involve any meaningful risk, and that their effective hourly rates are as high as $25,000 in some cases.Brickman, Lawyer Barons, 35-36. In a frequently-cited article published in the Washington University Law Quarterly in 2003, Brickman asserted that \"Since 1960, the effective hourly rates of tort lawyers have increased 1000% to 1400% (in inflation-adjusted dollars) while the overall risk of nonrecovery has remained essentially constant\u2014though it has decreased materially for such high-end tort categories as product liability and medical malpractice.\"Brickman, Lester. \"Effective Hourly Rates of Contingency-Fee Lawyers: Competing Data and Non-Competitive Fees.\" Washington University Law Quarterly 81, no. 3 (2003): 655. He argues that the American Bar Association has abdicated its ethical responsibility to curb what Brickman considers to be fee-gouging and greed on the part of the plaintiff bar,Brickman, Lester. \"ABA Regulation of Contingency Fees: Money Talks, Ethics Walks.\" Fordham Law Review 65, no. 1 (1996): 247, especially in mass torts like asbestos litigation, and class actions of all kinds, but especially the tobacco litigation of the 1990s.Brickman, Lester. \"Want to Be a Billionaire? Sue a Tobacco Company.\" Wall Street Journal, December 30, 1998, A10. ===Asbestos litigation=== Lester Brickman began speaking and writing about asbestos litigation in 1991, testifying on the asbestos litigation crisis before the House Committee on the Judiciary's Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration.Brickman, Lester. \"Statement of Lester Brickman.\" In Asbestos Litigation Crisis in Federal and State Courts: Hearings before the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration of the Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, One Hundred Second Congress, First and Second Sessions, October 24, 1991, February 26 and 27, 1992. Washington: U.S. G.P.O., 1993. His first articles on the subject appeared in the Cardozo Law Review in 1992.Brickman, Lester. \"Asbestos Claims Management Act of 1991: A Proposal to the United States Congress.\" Cardozo Law Review 13, no. 6 (April 1992): 1891-918, and \"Asbestos Litigation Crisis: Is There a Need for an Administrative Alternative?\" in the same issue, at 1819-90. Since then, he has become one of legal academe's most outspoken critics of asbestos litigation and its economic and ethical context, stating in a 2003 article in the Pepperdine Law Review that \"When the complete and unexpurgated history of asbestos litigation is finally written, that litigation will surely come to be considered for entry into the pantheon of such great American scandals as the Yazoo land scandals, Credit Mobilier, Teapot Dome, Billy Sol Estis [sic], the salad oil scandals, the Savings & Loan scandals, WorldCom, and Enron.\"Brickman, Lester. \"On the Theory Class's Theories of Asbestos Litigation: The Disconnect between Scholarship and Reality.\" Pepperdine Law Review 31, no. 1 (2003): 35. Brickman has published (as of summer 2016) fifteen articles on asbestos litigation, and testified on the subject three times before Congressional committees (see publications list and External Links below). The subject is also addressed in his 2011 book, Lawyer Barons. In January 2005, Professor Brickman was an invited contributor to a Presidential colloquy on tort reform in asbestos litigation, with then- President George W. Bush, held at Macomb Community College, in Warren, Michigan (see External Links, below). ==Critics== Brickman's numerous critics and adversaries in academe and legal practice have vigorously disputed his claims regarding systemic ethical misconduct, fraud, abuse, and fee-gouging by the plaintiff bar.His most recent article on this subject is Brickman, Lester. \"Fraud and Abuse in Mesothelioma Litigation.\" Tulane Law Review 88 (2014): 1072-152. Abstract Prominent among these are University of Texas at Austin law professor Charles M. Silver,Brickman, Lester, and Charles Silver. \"Contingency Fees -- Should Plaintiffs' Lawyers in the Tobacco Settlement Receive Billions of Dollars?\" Cardozo Law Review 83, no. 9 (September 1997): 74-75, Herbert M. Kritzer of the University of Minnesota School of Law, the late Ronald Motley (1944-2013) of the law firm Motley Rice,Motley, Ronald L., and Susan Nial. \"A Critical Analysis of the Brickman Administrative Proposal: Who Declared War on Asbestos Victims' Rights?\" Cardozo Law Review 13 (1992): 1919 Paid access at HeinOnline Elihu Inselbuch of Caplin & Drysdale , American Bar Foundation researchers Stephen Daniels and Joanne Martin , and journalist Stephanie Mencimer.Mencimer, Stephanie. Blocking the Courthouse Door: How the Republican Party and its Corporate Allies are Taking Away Your Right to Sue. New York: Free Press, 2006: 86-93 and 152-154. Many of Brickman's published arguments with other scholars are enlivened by colorful rhetorical fireworks. In 2005, for example, Brickman described his three-year altercation with Charles Silver on the subject of asbestos litigation, in characteristically earthy sesquipedalian style, as a \"micturating match.\"Brickman, Lester. Abstract of \"Rejoinder to the Rejoinder to On the Theory Class's Theories of Asbestos Litigation.\" Pepperdine Law Review 32, no. 4 (2005). Abstract As Boston University law professor Susan Koniak observed in her critique of Brickman's 1994 challenge to the American Bar Association's Ethics Committee, when \"Professor Brickman is not pleased,\" it is not unusual for \"sound and fury\" to be conspicuous features of his prose.Koniak, Susan P. \"Principled Opinions: Response to Brickman.\" Fordham Law Review 65 (1996): 337. Brickman's publications have provoked considerable interest and debate among his fellow legal scholars. One of his articles on the ABA ethics controversy, for example, with the provocative title \"ABA Regulation of Contingency Fees: Money Talks, Ethics Walks.\"Fordham Law Review 65, no. 1 (1996): 247. has been downloaded from Law Commons more than 3700 times since it was uploaded to the site in 2011. Brickman announces his purpose on p. 249: \"In this Article, I critique that Opinion [of the ABA], finding it wrong as a matter of ethics law, malevolent as a matter of public policy, disingenuous in its presentation, unfounded in the critical assumptions upon which the Opinion is based, illegitimate in its rejection of ethical considerations in favor of political partisanship, and blatantly self-interested in elevating lawyers' financial interests above their traditional fiduciary obligations to clients.\" This characteristically vehement and pugnacious personal style often attracts media attention to Brickman's scholarship. He is a frequent speaker at Federalist Society, Lawsuit Reform Association of New York, and other tort reform organization meetings (see External Links, below). Brickman himself acknowledges that he is a controversial figure among legal scholars by choice, concluding an unapologetically argumentative 2005 essay in the Pepperdine Law Review with the assertion that: \"This view underpins my scholarship: that identifying what is actually occurring in our legal system is, or at least ought to be, a prime purpose of scholarship; that by identifying these truths and bringing them to the attention of both the academy and the profession, I am providing an opportunity to curb abuses in the legal system; and that focusing on these abuses will ultimately be in the self-interest of the legal profession.\"Brickman, Lester. \"Rejoinder to the Rejoinder to On the Theory Class's Theories of Asbestos Litigation.\" Pepperdine Law Review 32, no. 4 (2005): 791. ==Family and personal life== Lester Brickman married for the first time in the mid-1960s. His firstborn, and only son, Theodore K. Brickman, was born October 20, 1966. This marriage ended in divorce in March 1969. In July 1977, Brickman married Miriam Bellman, n\u00e9e Dorf (b. 1939), the daughter of a Toledo-born photographer, restaurateur, and realtor of Russian- Jewish ancestry, Eli Dorf (1911-1983), and Ruth Shore Dorf (1914-1986).\"B'Nai Israel Sisterhood.\" Toledo Blade, November 21, 1954, 11; \"Librarians' Assistants,\" Jesup W.
