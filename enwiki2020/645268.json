Returning to the US, Fussell wrote extensively and held several faculty positions, most prominently at Rutgers University (1955-1983) and at the University of Pennsylvania (1983-1994). He is best known for his writings about World War I and II, which explore what he felt was the gap between the romantic myth and reality of war; he made a \"career out of refusing to disguise it or elevate it\". ==Biography== Born and raised in Pasadena, California, Fussell was the second of three children.
