    "text": "Blind Worms, Pious Swine is the twenty-ninth studio album by Omar Rodr\u00edguez- L\u00f3pez as a solo artist, released on 12 August 2016. It is his third release in the 12 album series initiated by Ipecac Recordings. According to Rodriguez- Lopez, Blind Worms was one of his last solo records before forming Bosnian Rainbows, and the first to be recorded in El Paso after moving back from Mexico. The fourth track, \"Lights\", is a cover of the 2010 song by Ellie Goulding, and the first ever cover to appear on a Rodriguez-Lopez album. The album closes with the final four tracks forming one 11-minute instrumental piece all together. \"Vanishing Tide\" was uploaded in advance as the album's single and was later re-recorded by Omar in 2018 and released on July 24, 2020 as part of The Clouds Hill Tapes Parts I, II & III. An official video of the song was uploaded by Clouds Hill soon after the release of Part II on July 17. ==Track listing== All songs written by Omar Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez, except where noted. # \"Vanishing Tide\" \u2013 3:19 # \"Atlantis Is Rising\" \u2013 3:40 # \"Black Mass\" \u2013 3:43 # \"Lights\" (Ellie Goulding/Richard Stannard/Ash Howes) \u2013 3:49 # \"Tunnel Riot\" \u2013 3:18 # \"Savage Letters\" \u2013 3:45 # \"Mariposa\" \u2013 4:20 # \"Swollen Neck\" \u2013 2:43 # \"Hieroglyphs From Hell\" \u2013 1:45 # \"Acacia\" \u2013 2:24 # \"Only Nothing Is\" \u2013 3:55 ==Personnel== * Omar Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez \u2013 vocals, guitars, synthesizers, mellotron, bass * Teri Gender Bender \u2013 vocals * Deantoni Parks \u2013 drums * Jon Debaun \u2013 recording * Chris Common \u2013 mixing, mastering, recording * Mackie \u2013 cover art & layout ==Release history== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !
