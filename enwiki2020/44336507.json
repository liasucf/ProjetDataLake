It derived its name from the Quyon River, a tributary of the Ottawa River that was used by Egan for log driving, and was originally spelled \"Quio\", from the Native Algonquin word kweia (pronounced \"quia\"), meaning \"Smaller River\"Lemoine, Dictionnaire Fran\u00e7aise=Algonquin, 1909 or \"sandy bottom river\". Some of the earliest English settlers were Scottish United Empire Loyalists, who were given free land in 1783 by the British Crown to thank them for their loyalty during the American Revolution.What Men They Were, S. Wyman MacKechnie, 1975, Dickson Press The area was heavily settled by Irish immigrants during the mid-19th century after the Great Famine forced many to emigrate for their survival. The town was incorporated on January 1, 1875, and its spelling was changed to \"Quyon\" to provide a compromise pronunciation equally acceptable to both French- and English-speaking residents.James Robinson, How Quyon Came to Be, 2006 It experienced a period of prosperity because of the railway built by the Union Forwarding Company. The village municipality of Quyon, along with the neighbouring townships of North Onslow, South Onslow, and Eardley, was amalgamated into the municipality of Pontiac in 1975. ==See also== *Pontiac Pacific Junction Railway - former railway running through Quyon ==References== Category:Communities in Outaouais ",
