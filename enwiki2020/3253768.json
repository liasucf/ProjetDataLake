Despite this, Sch\u00fctte-Lanz introduced many design innovations that were soon adopted by competitor Zeppelin. This is a late war example - probably 1918's S.L.22. Silhouettes demonstrate the relative sizes of six SL airships. SMS Seydlitz with an airship by Zeppelin or Sch\u00fctte-Lanz. Sch\u00fctte-Lanz (SL) is the name of a series of rigid airships designed and built by the Luftschiffbau Sch\u00fctte-Lanz company from 1909 until 1917. One research and four passenger airships were planned for post-war use, but were never built. The Sch\u00fctte-Lanz company was an early competitor of the more famous airships built by Ferdinand von Zeppelin. Although it is common for all rigid airships to be informally called zeppelins regardless of their manufacturer, this name technically only applies to those manufactured by the Zeppelin company. ==History== When the Zeppelin LZ 4 met with disaster at Echterdingen in 1908, Professor Johann Sch\u00fctte (1873-1940) started to consider the problems of airship design. He decided, with the co-operation of his students, to develop his own scientifically designed, high performance airship. In partnership with Dr Karl Lanz, an industrialist and wood products manufacturer, he started constructing the Sch\u00fctte-Lanz Luftschiffbau on 22 April 1909. The airships were successful at first, and introduced a number of highly successful innovations. Wood composites had a theoretical superiority as the structural material for airships up to a certain size, after which the superior strength of aluminum (and later duralumin) in tension was more important than the superior strength of wood in compression. Sch\u00fctte-Lanz airships until 1918 were made of wood and plywood glued together. Moisture tended to degrade the integrity of the glued joints. Sch\u00fctte-Lanz airships became structurally unsound when water entered the airship's imperfectly waterproofed envelope. This tended to happen during wet weather, but also, more insidiously, in defective or damaged hangars. In the words of F\u00fchrer der Luftschiffe Peter Strasser: The decision was made to compensate the company for the unusable wooden ships, and in response the company started work on a tubular aluminum-framed ship which was probably not completed. The German Navy had bases closer to the sea, and thus more humid. They were reluctant to accept wooden composite craft. As a result, the primary customer for Sch\u00fctte-Lanz airships was the German Army. The German Army decided well before the German Navy that airship operations were futile in the face of land-based heavier-than-air opposition. Twenty-four Sch\u00fctte-Lanz airships were designed before the end of the World War I, most of which the company was not paid for due to the collapse of the German Monarchy. By the time the last eight ships were ready, most of them could not be operated due to the loss of trained crews. In the postwar period, Lanz designed a series of very large airships for trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific passenger operations, as well as submitting a proposal for the US Navy\u2019s rigid airships ZRS-4 and ZRS-5. However none of these were ever realized. Data from: Zeppelin:rigid airships 1893-1940 ==S.L.1 (Type 'a')== The Sch\u00fctte-Lanz airship S.L.1 was the first of 20 airships built by the company. Construction was carried out in a large hangar at Rheinau near Mannheim. The ship was powered by four Daimler- Benz engines installed in two ventral gondolas. A distinctive feature of the Sch\u00fctte-Lanz ships was that the frame was constructed from special plywood which was (supposedly) waterproofed and protected from frost. The S.L.1 was constructed with a diamond lattice frame and had a highly streamlined shape, allowing it to achieve a record speed of . The structure of the S.L.1 resembles the later \"geodesic\" structures of Barnes Wallis at Vickers or Buckminster Fuller's domes. It was only matched at the time by the structure of the MacMeecham airship, designed and partially built in England in the first years of World War I. Fifty-three experimental flights were made between October 1911 and December 1912, the longest of over 16 hours. The ship was handed over to the German Army on 12 December 1912 but destroyed soon afterwards when it broke loose from its temporary mooring during a storm. *First Flight: 1 October 1911 *Length: *Diameter: *Gas Capacity: *Performance: *Payload: *Engines: 2x Daimler J8L 8-cyl in-line engines: total == S.L.2 (Type 'b')== The four engine gondolas hang under the hull in this image from the 1920 Lexikon der gesamten Technik. bombing Warsaw in 1914. The Sch\u00fctte-Lanz airship S.L.2 surpassed the contemporary Zeppelin airships in performance. It adopted the Zeppelin ring-girder construction method, but retained the streamlined shape and plywood construction of the S.L.1. The S.L.2 was also the most significant airship to date in that it laid down two vital design innovations that were copied in almost all subsequent rigid airships. The first was the cruciform tail plane, with a single pair of rudders and elevators. The second was the location of the engines in separate streamlined gondolas or cars. A third innovation, for war service, was the mounting of heavy machine guns for defense against attacking aircraft in each of the engine cars. S.L.2 was built between January and May 1914 and transferred to Austrian military control as the S.L.II. It carried out six missions in the first year of the war over Poland and France. After being enlarged in summer 1915, several more missions were carried out before S.L.2 was stranded at Luckenwalde on 10 January 1916 after running out of fuel and decommissioned. The S.L.2 demonstrated the Sch\u00fctte-Lanz wood girder's advantage in compression as opposed to tension allowed the Sch\u00fctte-Lanz type of airship to be technically superior until a certain size had been reached. *First Flight: 28 February 1914 *Length: ( after rebuild) *Diameter: ( after rebuild) *Gas Capacity: ( after rebuild) *Performance: ( after rebuild) *Payload: 8 tonnes *Engines: 4x Maybach C-X 6-cyl in-line engines: total ( total after rebuild) ==S.L.3 (Type 'c')== Naval airship based at Seddin which flew 30 reconnaissance missions and one bombing mission over England.
