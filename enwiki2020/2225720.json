The airline delivers air freight with its fleet of B767-300/200 aircraft from its primary hub at the Miami International Airport to 38 destinations throughout the Caribbean, Mexico, Central and South America. Their network spans 476 destinations throughout the world, including Europe, Asia, the Americas, Africa, and the Middle East.\"About Amerijet\". Amerijet. Retrieved on December 26, 2018. == History == The airline was established and started operations in 1974. It was founded by David Bassett (Chairman and Chief Executive) and a partner with one leased aircraft, a Cessna 401, operating passenger and cargo services between the US and the Bahamas. In 1976, Amerijet became a freight only carrier. In late 1978, courier contracts were taken from Purolator, FedEx, UPS, DHL and from Airborne Express in the early 1980s. In 1982, Bassett bought out his partner and created Amerijet International. The main services that Amerijet offers are general cargo shipping, pharmaceutical shipping, perishable shipping, oversized load shipping, live animal transport, and charter services. Among their airfreight operation, Amerijet also provides trucking services, including expedited delivery. Throughout the Caribbean, Central and South America, Amerijet offers last mile delivery for commercial customers. Amerijet has been a target internationally of animal rights activists for their transportation of animals for experimentation purposes in later years, particularly in conjunction with the Miami-based company Primate Products. Amerijet has been coming under increasing pressure in South Florida, with monthly demonstrations in front of its Fort Lauderdale office, and some of Amerijets upper management have even been protested at their homes. To date, two activists have been arrested in front of Amerijet's office. On Valentine's Day 2011, Amerijet ended their involvement in the primate trade with these words, \"Amerijet has ceased transporting primates for any and all purposes.\" Amerijet operated under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from 22 August 2001 until 31 December 2001, from which it emerged after financial restructuring. Amerijet International was majority-owned by H.I.G. from 2001 to 2016. On July 26, 2016, H.I.G. Capital completed the sale of Amerijet, the Miami-based all- cargo carrier to private equity firm ZS Fund L.P.\"Amerijet gets new owner and new CEO as founder bows out.\u201d The Load Star.
