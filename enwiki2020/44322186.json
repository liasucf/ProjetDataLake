    "text": "Former House of Assembly in Spanish Town The House of Assembly was the legislature of the British colony of Jamaica. It held its first meeting on 20 January 1664 at Spanish Town.Cundall, Frank. (1915) Historic Jamaica. London: Institute of Jamaica. p. 15. Originally there were twelve districts represented. For many years, a high property qualification ensured that the House of Assembly was dominated by the White Jamaican planter class. However, to elect these representatives, the bar was lower for \"freeholders\", who just had to be white men with a house, pen or plantation, and owned black slaves.Christer Petley, White Fury (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018), p. 42. A law passed in 1840 allowed some blacks and mixed-race men to vote in elections to the Assembly, though they had to own property, so the white planters continued to dominate it. As a result of the Morant Bay Rebellion, the Assembly voted to abolish self-governance in 1865. Jamaica then became a direct-ruled crown colony. ==See also== * Jamaican general elections, 1677\u20131863 * List of speakers of the House of Assembly of Jamaica * Parliament of Jamaica ==References== Category:Colony of Jamaica Category:Historical legislatures Category:Politics of Jamaica Category:Political organisations based in Jamaica Category:1664 establishments in Jamaica Category:1865 disestablishments in Jamaica Category:Members of the House of Assembly of Jamaica Category:Speakers of the House of Assembly of Jamaica ",
