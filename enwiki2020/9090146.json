Yaron Golan, originally a literature columnist in Haaretz, established a publishing company in 1990. While refusing to submit to conventional rules of publishing only popular or profitable books, he used to take on himself to publish every book submitted to him, publishing over 1000 books, often at a personal loss. However he still was the publisher of many important works, including anthologies by Nathan Zach and Avot Yeshurun. Golan died unexpectedly of cardiac arrest on January 23, 2007, and was buried the following day in Tel-Aviv. ==External links== * * * Category:1949 births Category:2007 deaths Category:Israeli businesspeople Category:Israeli columnists Category:Israeli publishers (people) Category:Burials at Yarkon Cemetery Category:20th-century businesspeople ",
