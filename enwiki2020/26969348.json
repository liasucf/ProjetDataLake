His older sister is Mercy Latinwo ==Controversy over Aganga's Ministerial Appointment== In 2010, Aganga's ministerial nomination was resisted by the Lagos State chapter of the PDP on the basis that he was filling the Lagos State ministerial slot but had not been born in the state. In June 2011, again Aganga's ministerial nomination was resisted by the Lagos State chapter of the PDP, but Aganga was approved by senate on 6 July 2011 as Minister. On both occasions Aganga was nominated as minister by General Obasanjo, the former President of Nigeria. ==Fitch Ratings October 2010== In October 2010, Fitch the rating agency cut the outlook on Nigeria's BB- rating to \u201cnegative\u201d from \u201cstable\u201d because of withdrawals from the Excess Crude Account and a drop in foreign currency reserves. Aganga who was at the time, Nigeria's Finance Minister, stated that Fitch Ratings\u2019 action to reduce the outlook on the country's sovereign credit rating was \u201cunduly punitive\u201d. ==Rice Importation Ends in 2014== In October 2011, Aganga, the Nigerian minister for Trade and Investment announced that rice importation in Nigeria will soon by the end of 2014. Nigeria has used various trade policy instruments such as import restrictions, and outright ban on rice import at various times from 1978 to 1995. All have failed. From October 1978 to April 1979, Nigeria's military government under Gen. Obasanjo, banned imports in containers under 50 kg. In April 1979, the Nigerian government introduced rice imports under restricted license only for Government Agencies. In September 1979, Obasanjo's government introduced a six months ban on all rice imports. In January 1980 the policy was changed again, by the civilian government of Shehu Shagari, this time the government issued Import license for 200,000 tonnes of rice. In October 1980, the same government changed the policy to no quantitative restrictions on rice under general import license. In December 1980, Shagari created a Presidential Task Force (PTF) on rice, and it was named the Nigerian National Supply Company to issue allocations to customers and traders. In January 1984, the Military regime of Muhammadu Buhari disbanded PTF on rice and importation was placed under general license restrictions. In October 1985, a few months after Major General Ibrahim Babaginda appointed himself as President of Nigeria, he imposed a ban on the importation of rice (and maize). During this period, rice was illegally imported into Nigeria through the country's borders. In 1995 the import ban on rice was removed by the then military President of Nigeria, General Sani Abacha, because local suppliers failed to meet demand. Since 1995, Nigeria has adopted a more liberal trade policy towards rice, until October 2011, when the civilian government of President Jonathan announced that it was going to ban rice importation in 2014. Nigerians are opposed to the banning of rice. ==MITI Workers Protest== On 30 July 2013, workers (civil servants) of the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment (MITI), Nigeria staged a protest in front of the ministry's head office, demanding the removal or sack of the minister Aganga for poor performance, gross incompetence and alleged financial misappropriation. The workers had accused the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Dauda Kigbu and his wife, Salma Kigbu, of treating the ministry so badly, stating that such liberties will not be tolerated. The workers were also protesting poor office structures and poor welfare packages. Aganga responded by saying President Jonathan had set aside N1 billion (Naira) to start new office, for workers of the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, in collaboration with the Saudi Arabian Government. ==Awards== In November 2011, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, conferred on Olusegun Aganga, the National Honour, Commander of the Order of Niger (CON).
