    "text": "The Alberta-British Columbia Senior League is a defunct senior men's ice hockey league that operated for the 1941-42 season. ==History== The West Kootenay League was a senior level hockey league that operated from 1922-23 through 1940-41; and the Alberta Senior Hockey League was a senior level league that operated between 1936 and 1941. Both leagues suspended their operations after the 1940-41 season due to World War II. For the 1941-42 season, four teams from the two leagues (along with the upstart Red Deer Buffalos), merged to form the Alberta-British Columbia Senior League. Due to the pressures of the war, the league lasted just one season. The West Kootenay League was resurrected for the 1945-46 season, and in 1946-47 the league expanded into the United States to become the Western International Hockey League. ==1941-42 season== ===Standings=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"40%\" | 1941-42 season ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | GP ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | W ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | L ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | T ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"7.5%\" | Pts ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"7.5%\" | GF ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"7.5%\" | GA ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"7.5%\" | PIM |- | Calgary Stampeders||32 ||22 ||6|| 4 || 48|| 154 ||97 ||n/a |- | Lethbridge Maple Leafs || 32 || 16 ||13 ||3 || 35 ||122 ||103 ||n/a |- | Kimberley Dynamiters ||32 ||16 ||16|| 0 || 31 ||105 ||122||n/a |- | Trail Smoke Eaters || 32|| 14 ||15 ||3 || 31 ||140|| 122 ||n/a |- | Red Deer Buffalos || 32 || 7 ||25|| 0 || 14 ||89|| 166 ||n/a |} ===Coaches=== * Marty Burke (Calgary Stampeders) * Riley \"Moon\" Mullen (Lethbridge Maple Leafs) * Ken Campbell (Kimberley Dynamiters) * Roy Bentley (Trail Smoke Eaters) * Frank Coulson (Red Deer Buffalos) ==Playoffs== ===Semi finals=== In the \"Best of 5\" semi-final series the Calgary Stampeders beat Trail Smoke Eaters 3 wins to none. *Game 1: Calgary 8 Trail 3 *Game 2: Calgary 3 Trail 2 *Game 3: Calgary 5 Trail 1 In the \"Best of 5\" semi-final series Lethbridge Maple Leafs beat Kimberley Dynamiters 3 wins to none, 1 tie. *Game 1: Lethbridge 2 Kimberley 2 *Game 2: Lethbridge 4 Kimberley 2 *Game 3: Lethbridge 4 Kimberley 1 *Game 4: Kimberley defaulted.
