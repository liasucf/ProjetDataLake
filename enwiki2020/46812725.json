    "text": "The western corsair, scientific name Rasahus thoracicus, is a variety of assassin bug and is one of the two species of \"two spotted corsairs\", the other being Rasahus biguttatus. The adults have an orange and black body and an orange spot on each wing. They feed primarily on other insects and after dark are attracted to bright lights (where prey are ample). Unlike most of the other assassin bugs, the bite of the western corsair can be extremely painful. ==Description and range== The adults have a body length of 18\u201323 mm. The black and amber thorax and unusually long legs are smooth and shiny, and the front pair of legs is noticeably larger than the others. The fully functional wings bear their most distinctive feature, each of which has a single large tan, orange, or red spot in its center. When at rest, these wings are folded on top of each other along the insect's back like the wings of a bee. Their range includes the American Pacific Northwest and most of the warmer areas of the state of California, including the Sierra foothills, coastal valleys, Central Valley, and the state's desert areas. They are voracious nocturnal ground insect-hunters, but only bite humans if handled roughly. The bites, however, can be severe enough to induce headaches that last for a week or more. The greatest risk of encountering one is on evenings between July and October. They like biteing humans and animals. they mostly like wam places and hide under beds and drawers. ==References== Category:Reduviidae Category:Endemic fauna of North America ",
