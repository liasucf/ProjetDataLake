The band laid the song in the studio the same day, which came out quite \"fully formed\". The initial version of the song has the same structure as the version that appears on the album. The lyric 'crack the shutters open wide' was the first that came to Lightbody, who further commented that it's \"the most natural song on the album, it's about the most natural thing in the world\".

The song is the one of many positive songs that Lightbody wrote for the album. In an interview with The Sunday Times, he said, \"The problem I've always had with writing about love is that you don't really stop and think about it when it's occurring. This time, I made myself think about it \u2013 how to fit it into words. The new lyrics took a lot longer than usual, but I'm proud of them.\" Lightbody credited producer Jacknife Lee with helping him with lyric writing. He praised him further, adding that it was Lee who taught him the importance of the lyrics sounding as good as they're well written. ==Promotion and release== The song became a fan favorite on the Take Back the Cities Tour.

Yahoo! Music's Jairne Gill reviewed the single positively, giving it seven stars out of ten.

He praised the guitar and glockenspiel in the song, and called the chorus \"a warm hug\". He also felt that vocalist Gary Lightbody's feelings sound genuine in the song.

She awarded the single four stars out of five. The Daily Record's John Dingwall also gave the single four stars out of five. He called the album \"brilliant\" and the song \"written\". He felt the delivery of the vocals was \"perfect\" and Gary Lightbody's \"emotive vocals\" provided \"the icing on the cake.\" Nick Levine of Digital Spy, however reviewed the single negatively, giving it two stars out of five. He wrote that the single sounded similar to their earlier work, and that it \"chugs along from intimate, piano-driven verses to choruses that are supposed to coax the mobile phones out of punters' pockets at their arena gigs.\" He criticized the chorus for not being \"as rousing as it thinks it is\". He ended saying fans should rather buy Take That's album The Circus instead. The song was named the \"Record of the Week\" in the Netherlands for week two of 2009.
