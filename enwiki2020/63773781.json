    "text": "Ferry Lina (F\u00e4rjan Lina) is the world's shortest regular ferry that cross the Swedish canal G\u00f6ta Canal. The ferry takes around 25\u201330 seconds. The ferry is powered by pulling a rope that must be lowered when a boat is passing. The ferry can be seen in the Swedish comedy movie \"G\u00f6ta kanal 3\" . == History == The ferry line was opened in 1919 by the retired driver Oskar Lindhult because of a new district in T\u00f6reboda on the other side of the canal. Before the ferry line opened the residents needed to use their own boat. In the beginning, the ferry that was used was a wooden boat. At the end of the 1930s, the skipper F\u00e4rje-Karl (Ferry-Karl) got permission to set up a rope over the canal and then a special ferry was built. In 2019 the ferry line celebrated 100 years of service. == References == Category:Ferries of Sweden ",
