    "text": "Giovanni Ventimiglia is Swiss\u2013Italian philosopher. He is full Professor of Philosophy at the University of Lucerne (Switzerland). Vice Dean of its Faculty of Theology. He is Visiting Professor of Medieval Philosophy in philosophy at the University of Italian Switzerland and Honorary President of Aristotle College, Lugano. From 2004 to 2016 he was ordinary professor of Theoretical Philosophy at the Faculty of Theology, Lugano, where he founded the Institute for Philosophical Studies (ISFI) (formerly the Istituto di Filosofia applicata) in 2003 (Director 2003-2017). Giovanni Ventimiglia works primarily on Thomas Aquinas, Thomism, often at the intersections of the continental and analytical traditions of philosophy (analytical Thomism). His main interests lie in classical ontology (analogy and senses of being, God as Being, God\u2019s names, transcendentals and medieval logic, transcendental multiplicity), and its relation to contemporary debates in analytic metaphysics. He also works on the reception of Plato\u2019s \u201cunwritten\u201d doctrines in medieval commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, the reception of Aristotle\u2019s philosophy in medieval theology and philosophy, and the reception of Aquinas in contemporary philosophy. He has also worked on the ontology of material, digital objects and of cyberspace and the relation between philosophy and psychoanalysis. ==Bibliography (selection)== * Tommaso d\u2019Aquino, La Scuola, Brescia 2014; transl. into Portuguese: S\u00e3o Paulo (forthcoming), transl. into Spanish: Bogot\u00e0 (forthcoming); * L\u2019ente, l\u2019essenza e l\u2019esistenza.
