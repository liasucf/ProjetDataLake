Later, when he had reached his limits as an amateur, he decided to learn painting professionally. At the age of 19, he applied for a place at the State Academy of Fine Arts in Stuttgart and studied for eight years with Carlos Grethe, Jakob Gr\u00fcnenwald, Robert von Haug, and Franz Herterich, and also with in Frankfurt. Due to his good performance, he received a scholarship for both a studio and lodging as well as a grant to study for six months in Italy. At that time the Art Academy aimed to empower aspiring artists to paint pictures for exhibitions. Hafner, however, was not compliant. It took years before he succeeded. He made amends with a return to his early passion. While his colleagues concentrated on the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries and mainly modern styles, Hafner found his artistic fulfilment in painting flowers and landscapes.Thieme-Becker K\u00fcnstlerlexikon, E. A. Seemann. His love of Far Eastern painting also served as an inspiration.

Together with the reform of educators and principals Martin Luserke and other fellow teachers, such as and , he moved, in 1925, to the North Sea island of Juist, near the \"Schule am Meer\", a reform school that was run as a boarding school. Just as previously in Wickersdorf, he worked in Loog Juist as an art and science teacher. By that point, he had become fascinated with the hilly landscapes of W\u00fcrttemberg, Thuringia, and Italy, and their flora and the process of painting a shoal at the Wadden Sea. He painted there, with his paintings being characterized for their finely nuanced watercolors.Historisches auf der Nordseeinsel Juist \u2013 Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten: Fritz Hafner , auf: juist.de, abgerufen am 7. After the school closed in 1934 due to economic and political reasons, Hafner remained in Loog with his wife Christel and their three children. He was forced by the loss of his income to enter his works in well-known exhibitions in major cities in Germany and to sell them if possible. This proved to be a difficult struggle, as he had to carry them with him, and also because he painted really only for himself and not with commercial interest. He therefore found it hard to be separated from his works. The Natural History Teaching Aids, a collection made at Schule am Meer, was presented by Hafner around 1934/1935 and was a small museum on the island of Juist with his exhibits on display. He agreed with the idea and was given the management of the museum, which he directed from 1934 to 1953, while his collection of paintings continued to expand.1934 \u2013 Fritz Hafner, Heimatmuseum Juist, auf: juist.de, abgerufen am 7. His love for the various types of mussels and snails was shown in a book which he devoted to the subject. Hafners' approximately 1,000 images (watercolors, drawings, oil paintings and sketches) are partly privately owned; the vast majority, however, are at the K\u00fcstenmuseum in Juist.Fritz Hafner, auf: ostfriesischelandschaft.de, abgerufen am 6.
