    "text": "A privy council is a body that advises the head of state of a nation, typically, but not always, in the context of a monarchic government. The word \"privy\" means \"private\" or \"secret\"; thus, a privy council was originally a committee of the monarch's closest advisors to give confidential advice on state affairs. == Privy councils == === Functioning privy councils === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
