She is most known as former mayor of the Felgueiras municipality, in northern Portugal. ==Personal life== F\u00e1tima Felgueiras was born in Rio de Janeiro, then capital city of Brazil, from Portuguese parents. When she was 4 years old, the family returned to Portugal and settled in Felgueiras, northern Portugal. She studied in a secondary school of Guimar\u00e3es and earned a degree in Germanic Philology from the University of Coimbra. Involved in local politics, F\u00e1tima Felgueiras took over as mayor of Felgueiras in 1995. F\u00e1tima Felgueiras has a daughter, Sandra Felgueiras, who is a well-known television reporter and journalist of RTP public service television network. ==Corruption allegations== She was placed under investigation after a series of anonymous letters addressed to Cunha Rodrigues at the public prosecutor's office. The police inquiry produced more than 120 volumes. The mayor of Felgueiras, F\u00e1tima Felgueiras, hurried through the streets of the small northwestern Portuguese city in the early afternoon of May 5, 2003. She was late for a funeral. But before she arrived at the cemetery, she took a phone call, returned home\u2014and disappeared. The then 49-year-old fugitive has been charged with 30 counts of corruption, embezzlement, prevarication and abuse of power and was suspected of managing a US$1 million \"saco azul\" (blue bag) to pay for her own electoral propaganda, Socialist Party office rent and phone bills, her new Audi, among others. Felgueiras faced a possible 25-year sentence, according to the Guimar\u00e3es Appeals Court (Tribunal da Rela\u00e7\u00e3o de Guimar\u00e3es). Seventeen other Town Hall employees and private entrepreneurs were involved in the scandal. Police sources said the mayor escaped to Rio de Janeiro (through Madrid and S\u00e3o Paulo) just before authorities received the warrant issued by the court. After several months in Brazil, and being the owner of a Brazilian passport, F\u00e1tima Felgueiras returned home to be arrested and released in less than 24 hours. She was re-elected for the Felgueiras Town Hall in October 2005, as an independent.
