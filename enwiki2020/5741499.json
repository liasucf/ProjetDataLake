    "text": "\"Soldier Boy\" is a song written by Luther Dixon and Florence Greenberg and made famous by the girl group the Shirelles. ==Background== Record executive Florence Greenberg, founder of Scepter Records (the Shirelles' record label), wrote the song and was originally titled \"I'll Be True To You\". The main frame of the song's lyrics make no mention of a soldier. It was only in the studio that the Shirelles gave the song a much better title to reflect its narrative, the profession of someone's love for the titular soldier boy in which she promises to remain true to him while he's away.The History of Rock and Roll Radio series, Bill Drake, 1978, Westwood One.
