    "text": "Paulownia fortunei commonly called the dragontree, dragon tree or Fortune's empress tree, is a deciduous tree in the family Paulowniaceae, native to southeastern China (including Taiwan), Laos and Vietnam. It is an extremely fast-growing tree, due to its use of C4 carbon fixation, and is planted for timber harvesting. It appears to be nowhere near as dangerously invasive as Paulownia tomentosa. ==Uses== Aside from its use as a cheap timber tree, it is being studied for use in phytoremediation and carbon sequestration. P. fortunei is cultivated as an ornamental tree in parks and gardens. Its cultivar 'Minfast' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. ==References== Category:Paulowniaceae Category:Trees of China Category:Trees of Laos Category:Trees of Taiwan Category:Trees of Vietnam Category:Plants described in 1890 ",
