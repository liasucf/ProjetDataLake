That station was evacuated in January 1956 because of a volcanic eruption on the neighboring Cook Island. The Corbeta Uruguay base was established, in 1976, by the military dictatorship governing Argentina to reinforce its territorial claims on British-held territory in the South Atlantic. The British government became aware of the base in December 1976 but sought a diplomatic solution to the issue until 1982. Early in the Falklands War, 32 special forces troops from Corbeta Uruguay were brought by the Argentine Navy ship Bah\u00eda Para\u00edso to South Georgia and landed at Leith Harbour on March 25, 1982. Corbeta Uruguay remained manned by Argentine personnel until June 20, 1982, when British forces, after victory over Argentina in the Falklands War, sent a task force to Thule Island to end the Argentine presence. After the Argentine garrison at Corbeta Uruguay surrendered, Thule Island was emptied and the facility left unmanned. In December 1982, it was mostly demolished by the Royal Navy after a patrolling warship (HMS Hecate) discovered that someone had taken down the Union Flag from the base flagpole and run up the flag of Argentina.Jeff Rubin. Antarctica. Lonely Planet, 2008. p. 258. The name honoured the Argentine corvette ARA Uruguay that rescued Otto Nordenskj\u00f6ld and his crew in 1903 in the Antarctic Peninsula, near the present-day Esperanza Base. This ship is now a floating museum, permanently berthed in Puerto Madero, Buenos Aires. ==See also== *History of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands ==References== ==External links== *La Corbeta Uruguay at Ciber-N@utica Category:Geography of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands Category:History of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands Category:Argentine Navy bases Category:Falklands War in South Georgia Category:1976 establishments in the British Empire Category:1976 establishments in Antarctica Category:1976 in the Falkland Islands Dependencies Category:1982 disestablishments in the British Empire Category:1982 disestablishments in Antarctica Category:1982 in the Falkland Islands Dependencies ",
