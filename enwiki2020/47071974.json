Unfortunately, he tore his hamstring during his senior year in college, thus ending his dance career. He then went on to train as a visual artist and completed a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at York University in Toronto, and then pursued a Master of Fine Arts at the University of Western Ontario, in London, Ontario. In 2006, he was a participant in the Independent Study Program of the Whitney Museum of American Art in Manhattan, New York. == Exhibitions and performances == Fernandes exhibited an installation and series of events at The Graham Foundation titled The Master and Form, in 2018.
