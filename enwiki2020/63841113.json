In Serie A the team finished in a decent third place, 6 points behind champions Inter. Meanwhile in the Coppa Italia the club was defeated in the round of 16. However, the club made history in the European Cup. The first round against Union Luxembourg was cleared by the squad with a famous 14\u20130 aggregate scoreline, with Altafini scoring five goals in the second match of the series. In the round of 16, the next rivals were English champions Ipswich Town, defeated thanks to a 3\u20130 home score, followed by a 2-1 defeat in England.
