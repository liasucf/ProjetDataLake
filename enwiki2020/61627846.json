He started his career in Los Angeles, hired by DreamWorks Animation in 1998 to work as an animator on their first 2D animated feature The Prince of Egypt, and honed his skills in traditional and cg animation on their next five movies \u201c\"\u2026 one of the producers asked me if I would accept to be trained in CG to see if a traditional animator could easily transfer his skills to this new medium. It might sound senseless today, but at the time producers were not convinced that it could work.\u201c Vgl. In 2007, he settled in Paris to write and direct his first short animated film French Roast.
