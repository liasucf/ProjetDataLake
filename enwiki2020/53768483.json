According to Holcroft, the idea of the play struck her while drinking coffee in the window of the National Theater's espresso bar following a meeting with her literary agent. > It was... born out of learning about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. I'd had > lots of it, and I'd wanted to write about it for a long time. And.. and also > a sort of love of... em... family comedies and... dinner-party farces. I'd > seen lots of them, and I'd seen them in films, and I'd seen them on TV, and > I'd seen them at the theater before, and I... wondered whether or not there > could be a marriage between what- the- the- the sort of well-told of the > families in a party farce that we're all quite familiar with, and whether or > not I could deconstruct that in any way, or... or explain that in any way > through Cognitive Behavioral techniques... And I wondered whether there was- > I- as an ambition for a play, could I bring together a family and assign > each one of them a personality trait or rule, and an underlying core belief > that they might be struggling with, and if they lived by that rule > throughout the course of the drama very strictly, would they rub up against > each other, would they set each other off, would we end up in the > inevitable... em... climax of the family dinner party as we've come to > expect it, and would I be able to marry the two? The debut performance occurred at the National Theatre in London from March 24 to July 8, 2015. Red Stitch Actors Theater in Melbourne, Australia performed the play from March to mid April 2017. ==Cast== === London Premiere === *Miles Jupp *Claudie Blakley *Deborah Findlay *Maggie Service *Daisy Waterstone *Stephen Mangan ==Critical reviews== Many of the reviewers noticed that Holcraft's play dealt with comedy in a way to reveal a larger theme about family dysfunction and how people cope with living as well as the \"Ayckbourn- esque\" feeling as viewers. Similar to the connection to Ayckbourn's work, many reviewers also picked up on the Cognitive Behavioral Theory implemented in the play. Matt Truman's Variety's review of the March 2015 production at the National Theatre in London believes that the music in the production is executed well with the play. At times, however, some of the play's interactions are too deliberate on set. Trueman interpreted the play as a \"seriously canny satire.\" Truman states, \"Holcroft not only ridicules our perfectionist culture, but shows the neurosis beneath and lets us feel the stress of its feedback loop ourselves.\" Michael Billington's review of the National Theatre production notes, \"Like Ayckbourn\u2019s Season\u2019s Greetings, the play confirms that Christmas is often a cue for self-revelatory crisis.... this is an intelligent comedy that leaves us questioning at what point the rules for living we all adopt become a form of entrapment.\" Bridget Galton thinks that the play could use a \"rethinking.\" Galton saw that Holcraft seemed \"ambivalent\" towards Cognitive Behavioral Theory, but the execution could have been different. Galton states, \"And while there are sharp jolts of comic recognition, there is also rampant overkill.\" Cameron Woodword in The Age (Melbourne, Vic.) stated that the play is \"wildly funny...domestic comedy in the mould of Alan Ayckbourn's Seasons Greetings.\" Dominic Cavendish, reviewer from The Telegraph reviewed the Dorfman Theatre production. Cavendish pulls out the \"Ayckbourn-esque drama\" of the performance. Cavendish states, \"Rules for Living at times borders on being the funniest and truest comedy I\u2019ve seen in ages, but it\u2019s also the strangest and most strained. It shouldn\u2019t really work at all. That it does, just about, is a testament to the talented array of actors.\" Cavendish picks up on themes of Cognitive Behavioral Theory. Cavendish states, \"A serious theme about Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, and the way we get stuck in and must break free from negative patterns of thought. The contrivance, observed by us, not commented on by the players, embodies a painful, dysfunctional reality. Kate Herbert of Herald Sun reviews thought it had an Aychbourn-like feel and explored the Cognitive Behavioral Theory in Holcroft's play. While the complex characters were apparent on stage, Herbert states, \"if the performances were reined in, the more complex issues of the dynamics of human behaviour might be clearer in Rules for Living, but the more reflective moments of the final scenes in this three-hour production come too late.\" Cameron Woodhead from The Sydney Morning Herald wrote a positive review. Woodhead states, \"Kim Farrant directs a strong ensemble with verve, allowing mayhem to develop from naturalism that's attractive and sharply grounded in familiar typologies. And the way she can puncture the hilarity with moments of poignancy... \u2013 really raises the theatrical stakes. Natasha Tripney of The Stage notices the Cognitive Behavioral Theory as well. Tripney states, \"But despite that late, delicious eruption of anarchy, there\u2019s something rather laboured about the production as a whole \u2013 its tread is heavy.\" == References == Category:2015 plays Category:British plays ",
