Besides, Polish Theatre in Moscow is a regular participant of theater festival in the framework of the program \"Moscow - the City of the World\". Theatre performances have been shown on stages not only in Moscow and other large Russian cities, but also in Vilnius, big cities of Poland - Warsaw, Szczecin, Krak\u00f3w, Rzeszow, Wroclaw, Sopot, etc. The theater not only makes plays, but also conducts a variety of educational programs and training for actors of Moscow theaters and students of theater schools. School of acting and directing - \"Open Theater School of Eugene Lavrenchuk\" - was opened within the theater. Regular training for personal growth, Polish language courses and theatrical studio for children are also held. == School of acting and directing == E. Lavrenchuk carries out active pedagogical activities in Russia and Europe. He is the founder and head of the School of acting and directing - \"Open Theater School of Lavrenechuka Eugene.\" The school education and training program is based on his own method of teaching using the new interpretation of the ideas of Michael Chekhov, Jerzy Grotowski, Antonin Artaud and Konstantin Stanislavsky. The essence of the new method underlying the teaching of acting and directing is antipsychologism as the basis of acting and directorial thinking. This radically changes the basic criteria of acting and elocution. The possibility of an effective alternative to traditional methods of teaching in theater education is proved by regular screenings, master classes and participated in international festivals. Every year, the School of Eugene Lavrenchuk conducts seasonal outreach workshops in the largest Polish cities (Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w, Zakopane, Gdansk, Sopot, Wroclaw, Swinoujscie, etc.), Where, along with students from Russia and CIS countries interested students from Poland and other European countries are gathered. == The performances in other theaters == \u2022 \u201cThe Chairs\u201d Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, M.
