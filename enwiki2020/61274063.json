    "text": "The 2020 CONCACAF Women's U-20 Championship was the 10th edition of the CONCACAF Women's U-20 Championship, the biennial international youth football championship organized by CONCACAF for the women's under-20 national teams of the North, Central American and Caribbean region. The tournament was held in the Dominican Republic between 22 February and 8 March 2020. The final tournament is expanded from eight to 20 teams, using the same format as the 2019 CONCACAF U-17 Championship. The top two teams of the tournament qualified for the 2021 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup (originally 2020 but postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic) in Costa Rica as the CONCACAF representatives, along with Costa Rica who automatically qualified as hosts. The U-20 Women's World Cup was initially to be co-hosted with Panama, but they backed out from co-hosting due to COVID-19 concerns, due to having the highest cases and deaths in the region. The fourth CONCACAF team to play in the U-20 Women's World Cup, which would initially be Panama, has yet to be confirmed. Mexico were the defending champions but was defeated by United States in the final. ==Qualified teams== The qualifying format has changed since the 2018 edition, and the teams are no longer divided into regional zones. The 41 CONCACAF teams were ranked based on the CONCACAF Women\u2019s Under-20 Ranking as of 2018. A total of 26 teams entered the tournament. The highest-ranked 16 entrants were exempt from qualifying and advanced directly to the group stage of the final tournament, while the lowest-ranked 10 entrants had to participate in the qualifying stage, where the four group winners and runners-up advanced to the round of 16 of the knockout stage of the final tournament. On 13 January 2020, CONCACAF announced that Costa Rica and Panama, who had automatically qualified for the 2021 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup as hosts, would no longer participate in the 2020 CONCACAF Women's U-20 Championship. As a result, the following changes to the tournament were made: *Guyana (Qualifying Group A winner) and Saint Kitts and Nevis (Qualifying Group B winner), enter the group stage instead of the round of 16. *Bermuda (Qualifying Group A third place) and Barbados (Qualifying Group B third place) enter the round of 16. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
