    "text": "John Musser (November 14, 1889 \u2013 March 21, 1949) was an American historian and educator who was dean of the graduate school at New York University and an instructor of American History. Musser attended Franklin and Marshall College before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania, from which he received his bachelor's degree. He went on to also earn his Ph.D. from Pennsylvania under the direction of Herman Vandenburg Ames. An authority on Benjamin Franklin, in 1937 Musser debunked a claim made by the Nazi Party that Charles Pinkney had once recorded in his diary that Franklin had made an anti-Semitic prophecy about a future threat of Jews in the United States by noting that Pinckney had never kept a diary and that Franklin himself had once donated money for the construction of a synagogue in Philadelphia. He was the grandfather of Charles Musser. ==References== Category:1889 births Category:1949 deaths Category:New York University faculty Category:University of Pennsylvania alumni Category:20th-century American historians ",
