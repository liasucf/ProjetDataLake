After meeting a strange man, he is given the chance to save his wife and the entire human race. ==Cast== * Ivan Sandomire as Chris Towne * Jamie Jackson as Leader * Andrew Sensenig as Jim Eldon * Erin Cunningham Anna Towne * Chris Henry Coffey as Whitmore * Adam David Thompson as Brad * Amber Davila as Susan ==Reception== On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 100% based on 5 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. Anton Bitel writing on Sight & Sound magazine included the film among the best shown on 2017 Sci-Fi-London. John Higgins from Starburst magazine gave the film 7 out of 10 stars and stated: \"Sandomire is very good in the lead role and holds the film together. Overall though, the smartly-written script will have the potential for repeat viewings to try and concoct where and how things unfold at the conclusion. Like last year\u2019s excellent \"Imitation Girl\", Diverge has much more to offer than CGI-action and pyrotechnics. Christopher Llewellyn Reed from \"Hammer To Nail\" wrote: \"At 85 minutes, Diverge never overstays its welcome, and proves, time and again (remember: time travel), that low-budget science fiction can more than deliver.\" Diverge gathered awards and nominations at several festivals, including Lund International Fantastic Film Festival, Boston Science Fiction Film Festival and Julien Dubuque International Film Festival. ==References== ==External Links== * * ",
