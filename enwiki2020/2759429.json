His career came to an abrupt end when he retired from pro cycling after a positive doping test in July 2004 for erythropoietin, leading into the Athens Olympics. After confessing to the use, in 2005 he was sued in Swiss court in order to name his supplier, which he refused to do fearing retribution. ==Major Results== ;1997 : 1st 20px Road race, National Road Championships : 2nd Overall Tour de Suisse ::1st Stages 1 & 9 ;1998 : 1st 20px Road race, UCI Road World Championships : 1st Giro di Lombardia : 2nd Milano\u2013Torino : 4th Overall Giro d'Italia ;1999 : 1st Stage 7 Tour de Suisse : 1st Stage 3 Giro del Trentino : 4th Giro di Lombardia : 6th Road race, UCI Road World Championships : 8th Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge ;2000 : 1st 20px Overall Tour de Suisse ;2001 : 1st Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge : 1st Stage 10 Tour de Suisse ;2002 : 1st 20px Overall Sachsen Tour International ::1st Stage 2 : 2nd Milano\u2013Torino : 3rd Giro di Lombardia ;2003 : 1st Stage 3 Sachsen Tour International ==See also== * List of doping cases in cycling *List of sportspeople sanctioned for doping offences ==References== ==External links== * Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Doping cases in cycling Category:Swiss male cyclists Category:Swiss sportspeople in doping cases Category:Olympic cyclists of Switzerland Category:Cyclists at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:UCI Road World Champions (elite men) Category:People from the canton of Schwyz Category:Tour de Suisse stage winners Category:Tour de France cyclists ",
