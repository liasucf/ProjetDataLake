The song received a nomination for Remix of the Year at the 31st edition of the Lo Nuestro Awards. ===Background and composition=== For the remix, Mau y Ricky invited three more female voices. On the Spotify's exclusive behind the scenes, Ricky said \"I think it's very important to support female talent, [so] it gets more powerful with the other ladies.\" Karol G admitted that she was \"excited\" about the song because it \"is loyal to what [she]'s ever wanted with [her] project: give women reasons to feel inspired and great.\" Leslie Grace stated that \"in the music industry, women are getting hold of their territory\" and Lali added that \"it's time for women to join\". Finally, Becky G also expressed her excitement by saying: \"we are this younger generation in music, and to be able to share the light is just incredible.\" Becky G and Grace had previously worked together on their joint single \"D\u00edganle\". The song peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Latin Digital Song Sales chart and was certified Latin platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America certification (RIAA). In 2011, Mau y Ricky (\"MR\" back then) had opened a show for Teen Angels, Lali's former group, at the Gran Rex Theatre in Buenos Aires. ===Critical reception=== Billboard described the song as a \"sizzling remix of the slow reggaeton jam.\" Additionally, Diana Marti from E! Online said that the track \"is infectious and you'll find yourself leaving it on repeat.\" Fuse's Jeff Benjamin added that \"[the remix] is more than just a hot rework, it's a larger spotlight on the great female talent coming from the Latin music community and highlights the necessity to shed more light on it\". ===Music video=== The official music video was shot by director David Boh\u00f3rquez in Miami, Florida on 18 January 2018. It premiered on Spotify's mobile app on 9 February 2018, on the newly relaunched \u00a1Viva Latino! playlist. Three days after, on 12 February, it made its premiere on Vevo. Boh\u00f3rquez had previously directed the music video for the original version. In the music video, Karol, Becky, Leslie and Lali all get to pose and smize for a camera recording them, but they're not doing it for Mau y Ricky's affection. Instead, the guys get to coolly hang out with their co-stars' faces projecting on screens. Furthermore, the diversity of Latin music's female superstars are on display here with all different kinds of body types, singing styles, fashion looks and hair colors are displayed by all four women who personify the exciting range of types of people around the world rocking the industry. ===Charts=== ====Weekly charts==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
