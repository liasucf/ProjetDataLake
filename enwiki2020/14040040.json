    "text": "Philip Louis Knell (March 12, 1865 \u2013 June 5, 1944) was a Major League Baseball pitcher between 1888 and 1895. He broke into the big leagues in June 1888, with the Pittsburgh Alleghenys, at the age of 23. Knell finished his career with a 79\u201390 record and 4.05 ERA. Despite having a relatively short MLB career, Knell still remains #28 on the list of \"most batters hit by a pitch\" by any major league pitcher. In a 1910 interview, slugger Ping Bodie acknowledged Knell as his first baseball mentor. ==References== ==External links== *Baseball-Reference Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Pittsburgh Alleghenys players Category:Philadelphia Athletics (PL) players Category:Columbus Solons players Category:Washington Senators (1891\u20131899) players Category:Philadelphia Phillies players Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:Louisville Colonels players Category:Cleveland Spiders players Category:Baseball players from California Category:1865 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Oakland Greenhood & Morans players Category:Omaha Omahogs players Category:Omaha Lambs players Category:St. Joseph Clay Eaters players Category:Sacramento Altas players Category:Los Angeles Seraphs players Category:Oakland Colonels players Category:Los Angeles Angels (minor league) players Category:San Francisco Friscos players Category:Fort Wayne Farmers players Category:Kansas City Blues (baseball) players Category:Stockton (minor league baseball) players Category:Hartford Indians players Category:San Francisco Brewers players Category:Sacramento Senators players Category:San Francisco (minor league baseball) players Category:San Francisco Seals (baseball) players Category:Sacramento Cordovas players Category:San Francisco Orphans players Category:19th-century baseball players ",
