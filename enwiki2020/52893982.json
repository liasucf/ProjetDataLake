    "text": "Iran route numbering system is a network of highways and roads in Iran that is managed by Iran Road Maintenance & Transportation Organization . The network comprises main highways and several major and minor country roads. ==History== Probably in the late 1990s, all road numbers were changed. The old system was also a grid, but with only 5 east-west routes (even numbers 2-10) and only 7 north-south routes (odd numbers 1-13). Therefore, the new system is a lot more dense, though there are a few sections that used to have a number which are not numbered anymore. ==Route signs== blue on motorways, green on other roads. 3-digit numbers appear in black on a white rectangle File:Freeway in Iran.svg|Freeway marker File:Expressway in Iran.svg|Expressway marker File:Road in Iran.svg|Road marker == Routes == ===Asian Highways=== * * * * * * * * * ===Motorway (Freeway)=== Numbers roughly increase from west to east . * * * * , under construction * * , under construction * * , under construction * , Partly built * , under construction ===National highway=== Odd numbers (11-99) generally denote north-south routes, while even numbers (12-98) denote east-west routes.
