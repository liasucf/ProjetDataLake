    "text": "J\u00f6nssonligan \u2013 Den perfekta st\u00f6ten (Johnson Gang \u2013 The Master Plan, called Mastermind outside of Scandinavia) is a 2015 Swedish film, directed by Alain Darborg. The film is a reboot of the Swedish film series J\u00f6nssonligan, and stars Simon J. Berger, Alexander Karim, Torkel Petersson, Susanne Thorson, Andrea Edwards, and Jens Hult\u00e9n. The creators have tried to make a thriller, unlike the previous films which have been comedies. J\u00f6nssonligan \u2013 Den perfekta st\u00f6ten was released on January 16, 2015 to middling reviews and poor box office. Critics and audiences felt the film lacked the comedic style they felt the franchise should have. == Plot == Charles Ingvar J\u00f6nsson (Simon J. Berger), are together with his uncle Ralf, Stockholm's most skilled car thieves. But one day a robbery goes wrong and Ralf is murdered, while Charles is framed for the murder. To take revenge on Ralf's killer, the corrupt business woman Wallentin (Andrea Edwards), the banking director of Wallentin Exchange, Charles makes a plan to implement the most complicated coup in the history of Sweden. He recruits the fraudster Ragnar Vanheden (Alexander Karim), explosives expert Harry (Torkel Petersson), and lock specialist Rocky (Susanne Thorson), who is also Charles's ex-girlfriend, to help him in his revenge mission. == Cast == * Simon J. Berger as Charles Ingvar J\u00f6nsson ** Edvin Ryding portrays a younger Charles. * Alexander Karim as Ragnar Vanheden * Torkel Petersson as Dynamit-Harry * Susanne Thorson as Rocky * Andrea Edwards as Wallentin * Jens Hult\u00e9n as Krantz * Niklas Falk as Ralf * Irma Hjort Erixson as Anja * Juan Rodr\u00edguez as Alejandro * Anki Larsson as School counselor * Alexandra Alegren as Wallentin's secretary * Ramtin Parvaneh as Keeper == Production == === Development === Over the years there had been plans to continue the film series, but these never became a reality. In 2011, Ulf Brunnberg, who played Vanheden in the eight original films, stated that he and Bj\u00f6rn Gustafson would like to do some more films, if G\u00f6sta Ekman was coming back as Charles Ingvar J\u00f6nsson. He said that he had tried to persuade Ekman without success. Since Ekman at that time already decided not to work anymore, Brunnberg did not think that there would be no more films. There were also plans to make more films about Lilla J\u00f6nssonligan. There has also been an idea to make a film in which the members are a little older (perhaps around 16\u201320 years of age) about how it all began, a little in the style of the film Kenny Begins (2009). On September 9, 2011, news media reported on the Internet that the production company Tre V\u00e4nner recently had secured the rights to three new films about J\u00f6nssonligan. These films would become reboots, i.e. films that unfold before the classic films, and would show how the gang met for the first time, with a new and younger cast. On September 26, 2013, the films title, along with the director and cast, was announced. The film was titled J\u00f6nssonligan \u2013 Den perfekta st\u00f6ten, and were to be directed by Alain Darborg, as his directorial debut, and produced by Fredrik Wikstr\u00f6m Nicastro, who also produced the 2010 film Easy Money, and its two sequels. === Casting === The gang members was portrayed by Simon J. Berger as Charles-Ingvar J\u00f6nsson, Torkel Petersson as Harry, Alexander Karim as Vanheden, and Susanne Thorson as Rocky. On October 21, 2013, Andrea Edwards and Jens Hult\u00e9n were cast as the film's villains, who according to the film's producer Fredrik Wikstrom Nicastro will be more reliable than previous villains in the series. === Filming === The filming started in late October, 2013, and was released on January 16, 2015. == Reception == In Sweden, the film received mixed to negative reviews. In Expressen, the reviewer gave it 3 out of 5, calling it \"sympathetically light-hearted, exciting, well-played and appealing\", and a \"somewhat clumsier version of Soderbergh's 'Ocean'-movies\". In Dagens Nyheter, the reviewer gave it the same rating, praising the chemistry of the ensemble and calling the movie generally entertaining. A more negative review is found in G\u00f6teborgs-Posten, where the film got 2 out of 5 and was described as \"not funny enough to work as a comedy and not thrilling enough to work as a gangster action movie\". The film was not commercially successful. == Cancelled sequel == In conjunction with the premiere of the film, the film's producer Fredrik Wikstr\u00f6m Nicastro, revealed that two sequels are planned to be released in the near future. He stated that they have two scripts ready for production, but that it is ultimately up to the moviegoers to decide if they should go ahead with the sequels. A reboot is set for 2020. == References == == External links == * * Category:Swedish action films Category:Swedish adventure comedy films Category:2010s adventure comedy films Category:J\u00f6nssonligan films Category:Films directed by Alain Darborg Category:Films set in Stockholm Category:Films shot in Stockholm Category:Reboot films Category:Tre V\u00e4nner films Category:2010s heist films Category:2015 films Category:Swedish films Category:2015 in Sweden Category:2015 directorial debut films ",
