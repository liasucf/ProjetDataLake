    "text": "Dasopant (1551-1615) belonged to the Datta sect. He was born in a Deshastha Brahmin family in the village of Narayan Peth. He wrote a commentary on the Gita called 'Gitarnava'. He also wrote the 'Gitarthabodhachandika' which is a smaller commentary as compared to his previous book. Another book authored by him was the 'Grantharaj', which is considered a precursor of Dasbodh. However, since most of his works lack significant literary qualities, only a small part of them have been published. ==References== Category:1551 births Category:1615 deaths Category:Marathi-language writers Category:Hindu writers ",
