He scored 29 goals in 157 appearances at Bradford City. In 1993\u201394, Leonard was part of the Chester City side that were promoted as runners-up in Football League Division Three, in his only season with the club. It was the first of three successive clubs he played for under manager Graham Barrow. A knee injury at the last of these, Rochdale, ended his career. After 19 years as a professional footballer, Leonard took up crown green bowls. He won the Merseyside Merit tournament in 2001. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from St Helens, Merseyside Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Witton Albion F.C. players Category:Everton F.C. players Category:Tranmere Rovers F.C. players Category:Crewe Alexandra F.C. players Category:Stockport County F.C. players Category:Bradford City A.F.C. players Category:Rochdale A.F.C. players Category:Preston North End F.C. players Category:Chester City F.C. players Category:Wigan Athletic F.C. players Category:English Football League players ",
