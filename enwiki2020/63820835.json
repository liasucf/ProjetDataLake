    "text": "The Lot (stylised as the lot) is a compilation album by Queen drummer Roger Taylor. The album contains nearly all of his solo work, both with the Cross and by himself. The album's release was originally scheduled for 11 October 2013, but was pushed back a month; both The Lot and Fun on Earth were released on 11 November 2013. Many fans soon complained about technical issues with The Lot. Taylor and his manufacturing team attempted to address these by asking buyers to return copies of the problematic first issue in exchange for corrected copies. The album was re-released on 10 November 2014. == Background == Apart from his work with Queen, Taylor recorded five solo albums, and three with the Cross. He released his first single, \"(I Wanna) Testify\", in 1977. He went on to record two solo albums, Fun in Space (1981) and Strange Frontier (1984). They were modestly successful when released. In 1986, two years after the release of Strange Frontier, Taylor formed the Cross, recruiting Spike Edney, Clayton Moss, Peter Noone, and Josh Macrae. The Cross went on to record three albums: Shove It; Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know; and Blue Rock. The band split up in 1993. After the breakup of the Cross, Taylor released his third solo album, Happiness?. It engendered some controversy, due to the inclusion of the track \"Nazis 1994\". The furore likely increased sales, however. In 1998, Taylor released his fourth album, Electric Fire. He would not record another album until Fun on Earth, which was released on 11 November 2013. All of Taylor's solo albums and all of the Cross albums, as well as several standalone singles and alternate mixes of some songs, are included on The Lot, a 13-disc box set released on the same day as Fun on Earth. Discs One through Eight are the Taylor and Cross albums, in chronological order. Discs Nine through Twelve include singles, such as the Cross's \"Manipulator\", which is not on any of the band's albums. Disc Thirteen is a DVD containing music videos. There were several technical problems with the first issue of the album. These included errors in the printed lyrics, the inclusion of the wrong mixes of some songs, and several other audio issues. Consumers who had bought the initial release were asked to return their copies to Universal Records, which would replace them with corrected copies. Taylor assessed The Lot as a good retrospective of his career: \"It's very satisfying to get it all in one place. I didn't realise how much there was: eight CDs, videos, lots of singles. I\u2019d forgotten a lot. But it's very satisfying\". == Track listing == All tracks written by Roger Taylor, except where noted. == Personnel == The following personnel worked on the album: * Roger Taylor: art conception, cover design, design, drums, executive producer, guitar, guitar feedback, instrumentation, keyboards, mixing, percussion, piano, primary artist, producer, soloist, stylophone, lead and backing vocals * Spike Edney: composer, keyboards, mandolin, piano, backing vocals * Clayton Moss: composer, guitar, lead and backing vocals * Peter Noone: bass, composer, backing vocals * Josh Macrae: drums, percussion, backing vocals, engineer, mixing, producer, programming === Additional musicians === * Keith Airey: guitar * Gary Barnacle: saxophone (on \"Cowboys and Indians\", \"Contact\", and \"Stand Up For Love\") * Steve Barnacle: bass * Jeff Beck: guitar (on \"Say It's Not True\") * Phil Chen: bass * Jim Cregan: guitar * Mike Crossley: keyboards, piano * John Deacon: bass (on some tracks) * Matthew Exelby: guitar * Jason Falloon: bass, guitar * Steve Hamilton: saxophone * Kevin Jefferies: bass * Helen Liebmann: cello * Dick Marx: arranger, strings * Brian May: rhythm guitar and lead guitar (on some tracks) * Freddie Mercury: lead vocals (on \"Heaven for Everyone\"), backing vocals (on \"Killing Time\" and \"Feel the Force\") * Treana Morris: lead vocals (on \"Surrender\") * Jonathan Perkins: keyboards, organ, lead and backing vocals * Catherine Porter: backing vocals * Keith Prior: drums * David Richards: keyboards * Geoffrey Richardson: viola, violin * Nicola Robins: violin * Phil Spalding: bass * Steve Stroud: bass * Rufus Taylor: drums, piano * Candy Yates: backing vocals * Claire Yates: backing vocals * Yoshiki: arranger, drums, piano, synthesizer (on \"Foreign Sand\") === Technical personnel === * Rich Breen: engineer, mixing * John Brough: engineer * Brad Buxer: programming * Dean S.
