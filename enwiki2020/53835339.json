    "text": "John Geggus was a footballer who played as goalkeeper for Custom House, West Ham United and Gravesend United. ==Club career== Geggus played 31 times for West Ham United in the Southern League, keeping nine clean sheets in total. Geggus' departure from West Ham was marred by his refusal to continue the game against Leyton on 9 April 1912 after being on the receiving end of disparaging comments from the West Ham support. Geggus' place was taken by Joseph Hughes and Geggus played only once more for West Ham. ==Personal life== Geggus is the paternal grandfather of Cockney Rejects vocalist Jeff Turner. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:English footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:West Ham United F.C. players Category:Gravesend United F.C. players Category:Southern Football League players ",
