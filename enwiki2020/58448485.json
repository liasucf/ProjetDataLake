    "text": "The Col. J. Hinckley House is a single-family home located at 210 High Street in Fenton, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. ==History== This house was built in 1868 by Colonel J. Hinckley. Little else is known about Col. Hinckley, but the house was later occupied by a string of Fentonville's most prominent businessmen. These included nineteenth century industrialist, A. J. Phillips, dry goods merchant Brent Birdsall, First National Bank of Fentonville founder David Latourette (who endowed the prestigious Fenton Seminary), and, in the 1920s, Aetna Cement Company president Earl Bunce. ==Description== The Col. J. Hinckley House has an Italianate massing, with two square sections with wide overhanging hip roofs, fitted together in an L-shaped configuration. However, the house lacks the typical Italianate ornamentation; indeed, other than a frieze with dentils located below the roofline, no particular detailing exist on the exterior. The lack of ornamentation highlights the home's interesting exterior finish in stucco, applied by Bunce to the facades of his brick home. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Genesee County, Michigan Category:Italianate architecture in Michigan Category:Houses completed in 1868 ",
