Completed in 1938 and assigned to the Black Sea Fleet, she participated in the Raid on Constan\u021ba on 26 June 1941, a few days after the beginning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. After the ship had finished bombarding targets in the port, she was sunk by a mine. ==Design and description== Impressed by the French large destroyer (contre-torpilleur) designs such as the of the early 1930s, the Soviets designed their own version. The Leningrads had an overall length of and were long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of , and a draft of at deep load. Built in two batches, the first batch (Project 1) displaced at standard load and at deep load. Their crew numbered 250 officers and sailors in peacetime and 311 in wartime.Breyer, pp. 218, 220 The ships had three geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller, designed to produce using steam from three three-drum boilersBudzbon, p. 329 which was intended to give them a maximum speed of . The Leningrads carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at .Breyer, p. 220 As built, the Leningrad-class ships mounted five B-13 guns in two pairs of superfiring single mounts fore and aft of the superstructure and another mount between the bridge and the forward funnel. The guns were protected by gun shields. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by a pair of 34-K AA guns in single mounts on the aft superstructure and a pair of 21-K AA guns mounted on either side of the bridge as well as a dozen M2 Browning machine guns in six twin mounts. They carried eight torpedo tubes in two rotating quadruple mounts; each tube was provided with a reload. The ships could also carry a maximum of either 68 or 115 mines and 52 depth charges. They were fitted with a set of Arktur hydrophones for anti-submarine detection. ==Construction and career== Moskva, named after the capital of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic,Hill, p. 26 was laid down on 29 October 1932 at Shipyard No. 198 (Marti South) in Nikolayev as yard number 224,Rohwer & Monakov, p. 232 and launched on 30 October 1934. She was towed to Shipyard No. 201 in Sevastopol for completion, and reached in sea trials during April 1938. Commissioned on 10 August of that year,Kachur, pp. 23, 30 she was assigned to the 3rd Division of the Light Forces Detachment of the Black Sea Fleet three days earlier.Breyer, p. 216 On 16 November she left for Istanbul to participate in the funeral of Turkish President Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, arriving there a day later. While in Turkey, 40 officers and sailors traveled to Ankara to lay a wreath before the destroyer leader departed Istanbul on 25 November, returning to Sevastopol three days later after exercises in the Black Sea. Moskva transported Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Saraco\u011flu back to Istanbul between 19 and 20 October 1939, visiting the port with the destroyer until 23 October.Kachur, pp. 73\u201374 She was included with the Light Forces Detachment in a squadron of ships intended to participate in engagements with enemy fleets formed by the Black Sea Fleet in May 1940, leading one of the two destroyer divisions of the Light Forces Detachment, which was capable of independent operations.Komoedov, p. 206 Late that year, she participated in joint maneuvers with the Transcaucasian Military District in the eastern Black Sea. Kapitan-leytenant (Captain lieutenant) Alexander Tukhov took command of the ship in February 1941. In event of a Romanian attack on the Soviet Union, Moskva, as part of the Black Sea Fleet squadron, was to destroy or capture the Romanian fleet and cut communications, blockade the Romanian coast, support a potential amphibious landing and Soviet troops advancing along the Black Sea coast. To practice this plan, she participated in exercises with the Red Army's 9th Special Rifle Corps between 4 and 19 June, supporting a mock amphibious landing on the west coast of Crimea, near Tendra. ===Raid on Constan\u021ba=== Following the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the squadron of the Black Sea Fleet was tasked with disrupting Axis supply lines by bombarding the Romanian port of Constan\u021ba and its oil tanks. The time of the bombardment was set for 05:00 on 26 June, to be preceded by a 30-minute airstrike by aircraft of the fleet beginning an hour earlier. For the raid, the heavy cruiser and Moskva were to cover the bombardment of the port by the latter's sister ship and the destroyers and . To prevent Axis air attack, the ships began to depart Sevastopol at night, at 18:00 on 25 June. However, before exiting the bay, the ships were ordered back to port because the plan was changed by the People's Commissar for the Navy, Vitse-admiral (Vice Admiral) Nikolay Kuznetsov, who ordered that the two destroyer leaders conduct the bombardment, with the other ships in support. Moskva and Kharkov departed Sevastopol Bay at 20:10, initially heading towards Odessa as a deception measure and then turning towards their destination slightly more than an hour later, followed by the support group.Kachur, p. 75 On the morning of 26 June, Moskva and Kharkov bombarded the port as scheduled, although the airstrike was not carried out. The former contributed 196 out of the 350 rounds fired between them at oil tanks and railway stations from a range of about , blowing up an ammunition train and inflicting considerable damage. As they were preparing to depart after having fired for 10 minutes, they were engaged by German coastal artillery and the Romanian destroyers and at ranges between . Silhouetted against the dawn, the Axis fire soon bracketed Moskva and hit her mainmast. Shortly afterwards, she struck a mine, probably laid by the Romanians on 16\u201319 June, which broke the ship in half; prior to the raid, the ships conducting it were not given precise charts of minefield locations. Moskva sank quickly, but German Heinkel He 50 floatplanes and Romanian motor torpedo boats were able to rescue 69 survivors, including seven officers.Hervieux, pp. 70\u201371 Among those captured was Tukhov, who was reported by Soviet accounts to have later escaped and been killed while fighting as a partisan.Kachur, pp. 76\u201378 In 2011, the wreck of Moskva was discovered by Romanian divers at a depth of from Constan\u021ba. ==Notes== ==Citations== == Bibliography == * * * * * * * * ==Further reading== * * == External links == * Interview with diver who discovered Moskva shipwreck Category:Leningrad-class destroyer leaders Category:Ships built at the Black Sea Shipyard Category:1934 ships Category:World War II destroyers of the Soviet Union Category:Ships sunk by mines Category:World War II shipwrecks in the Black Sea Category:Soviet Union ",
