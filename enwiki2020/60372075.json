Borgnis (December 24, 1906 \u2013 August 27, 1982) was a German applied physicist and electrical engineer, known for his contributions to microwave physics, guided waves and ultrasonic measurements for medical diagnostics. == Background == Fritz E. Borgnis was born on December 24, 1906, in Mannheim, Germany. After completing high school in Hamburg, he matriculated at the Technische Hochschule of Munich where he received a diploma in electrical engineering in 1929. Retrieved March 30, 2019. He continued at the University of Munich and obtained a Dr. Ing. degree in the field of current flow by convection and diffusion.Fritz Borgnis 1906-1982. ETHZ Digital Library. Retrieved March 30, 2019. He continued his academic career at the University of Graz followed by two years at the ETH Zurich from 1948 until 1950. During the next seven years, he worked and taught at various universities in the USA. From 1957 until 1960 he acted as director of research at the Allgemeine Deutsche Philips Industrie in Hamburg. 1960 Borgnis accepted a faculty position at the ETH in Zurich. He became full professor for high-frequency electronics. From the early 1960s, projects at his institute at the ETH dealt with measurements of flow in liquids using ultrasound. Several publications describe the progress achieved as pioneers in this field.Peter J. Wild: LCD Evolution - Swiss Contributions. Engineering and Technology History Wiki.

IEEE Trans. on Bio-Medical Engineering, Vol. BME-11, nr. 4, October 1964, pp. 154-156. Later, experiments to measure the flow in human blood vessels were conducted.P. Frutiger, F.
