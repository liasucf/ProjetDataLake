    "text": "The Lotto Park is a football stadium in the municipality of Anderlecht, Brussels. It is home to R.S.C. Anderlecht. It also hosted the UEFA Euro 1972 semifinal Hungary against Soviet Union, as well as several games of the Belgium national football team. ==Overview== It was in 1917 that R.S.C. Anderlecht installed, on the border of the Meir Park (later renamed Astrid Park), a new stadium with only one wooden stand. They called it \u00c9mile Vers\u00e9 Stadium, in the name of a generous patron. Later, concrete stands were set up. Though, in 1983, the stadium was completely rebuilt and took the name of the club's then chairman Constant Vanden Stock. Its capacity was decreased to 21,500 Een nationaal stadion stamt uit de koloniale tijd erasmix.be, 15 may 2013. During European competitions, the stadium is all-seated, which decreases its capacity. In 2010 the son of Constant Vanden Stock, Roger, announced together with RSC Anderlecht's manager Herman Van Holsbeeck that the club was going to build a third ring above the two existing in order to increase the stadium's capacity to 30,000 places. To date, these works have not started, and it is doubtful they will, as in 2014 Anderlecht agreed to become anchor tenant of the planned 60,000+ new national stadium, thus sealing the fate of their spiritual home. In summer 2012, rail seats for safe standing were fitted on the terracing behind each goal.http://stadiumdb.com/news/2012/07/belgium_anderlecht_gives_cvds_a_makeover In 2019, the stadium was renamed from Constant Vanden Stock Stadium to Lotto Park, after the sponsor. The stadium address is Avenue Th\u00e9o Verbeecklaan 2, B-1070 Anderlecht. It is located near Saint-Guidon/Sint-Guido metro station. Rival supporters must stop at Aumale metro station for UEFA Champions League matches due to security measures. The stadium hosts a former one-star restaurant (Le Saint-Guidon) and a cafeteria, as well as the official club fanshop and the ticketing. ==References== ==External links== * Stadium Guide Article * Stadium Database Article * Images of the expansion of the stadium at Jaspers-Eyers Architects Category:Sports venues completed in 1917 Category:UEFA Euro 1972 stadiums Category:Football venues in Brussels Category:Anderlecht Category:R.S.C.
