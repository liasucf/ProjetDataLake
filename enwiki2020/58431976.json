The movie scores for Ammy\u2019s honest performance. Sarbjit Cheema and Drishti Grewal too have done a good job of their roles. It\u2019s a good attempt to depict an age- old tradition and love in all its innocence.\u201d Punjabi website Daah Films gave three stars out of five. She praised the chemistry between Virk and Bajwa, performances of all characters; in last added, \u201cNegative aspects are that the Twists and Turns shown in the film are not very factful which came out to give an unimpactful ending. Technical aspects are good as Direction has binded the story and others aspects like Cinematography, Editing, Art Direction all are also done well. Music of Muklawa is good as all the songs are very entertaining but Kala Suit song is not the film. Now may be this could be because of any technical issue or story demand.\u201d == References == ==External links== * * Category:Indian films Category:2019 films Category:2010s Punjabi- language films Category:Indian romantic comedy films Category:Films directed by Simerjit Singh Category:2019 romantic comedy films ",
