The main-belt asteroid 17855 Geffert, discovered at Stakenburg in 1998, was named in his honor. The official naming citation was published on 9 March 2001 (). He died on 4 October 2015, at the age of 93. Martin Geffert should not be confused with German astronomer Michael Geffert (born 1953), who has discovered several minor planets, and after whom the asteroid 12747 Michageffert has been named. == References == == External links == * Hobby-Astronom aus Leidenschaft, obituary * Minor Planets discoverer Erwin Schwab \u2013 Asteroid Geffert, biography Category:1922 births Category:2015 deaths Category:20th-century astronomers Category:German astronomers ",
