The company was founded by L\u00e9on Barthe in 1920. It survived the German occupation during World War II, and after several changes in ownership wound up being a subsidiary of Fabrique Nationale of Herstal sometime in the 1970s. MAB made parts for FN under their ownership, but eventually was forced to close in September 1982.
