In high school he set up his first national and international rock cover band, playing at school festivals and neighborhood parties. Over the years, Alexander became increasingly interested in the arts, so much so that he eventually studied Art Education at Alc\u00e2ntara Machado College of Arts. At this college he got to know the arts as a whole but became more interested in theater and music. Acting in various works, Alexandre has always sought to unite his two great artistic passions, music and theater. He went through several groups and bands where he experimented with different styles and rhythms and thus began his professional career in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo. In 1991, he voluntarily joined the Catholic entity CCEV (Community House Hope and Life) where recovering drug and alcohol addicts where began a work involving the arts in the treatment of recovering. That same year he set up a work with a rock band where he was one of the protagonists. With the task of doing the drug prevention work, this rock band called Eterna recorded and released their first CD in 1994. After great success Eterna's work became known in Brazil. Being invited to show the success of her work with drug addicts through the arts, in 1998, Eterna participated in the David International Multifestival of Arts in Barcelona, Spain. In 1999, Alexandre became the host of a television musical program called \"Canto da Hora\" by producer ASJ (now 21st Century TV). In this program that aired throughout Brazil by Rede Vida de Televis\u00e3o and later, also by TV S\u00e9culo XXI itself, there were singers, bands, theater and dance groups that Alexandre helped to discover and launch throughout Brazil. In the year 2000, Alexandre Soul chose to pursue a solo musical career and to dedicate himself to his studies, when he joined FASCS (S\u00e3o Caetano do Sul Arts Foundation) where he began to study composition and conducting.

Making an increasingly mature and refined sound, in a well-elaborated mix of MPB with Soul Music, Alexandre Soul produced and released in 2011 his second album, the CD \"Joelhos no Ch\u00e3o\". In this album, Alexandre continued the work of drug and alcohol prevention talking about everyday life, addressing themes related to family, relationships, work and so on.
