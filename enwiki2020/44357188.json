    "text": "Under the Red and White Sky is the first solo album by singer, songwriter and guitarist John Wesley. It was released in 1994 on Racket Records, a label operated by the British progressive rock band Marillion and used mainly for their own and related releases. Wesley had previously worked as a guitar technician on one of the band's North American tour in the early 1990s and was eventually promoted to their opening act. Marillion's keyboarder Mark Kelly appears on all tracks and also produced the album with sound engineer Jim Morris. Additionally, Marillion guitarist Steve Rothery and drummer Ian Mosley contributed. Other musicians include Mark and Paul Prator, who Wesley (as Wes Dearth) had previously played with in the band Autodrive. Additionally, the album features Sean Malone of Gordian Knot (credited as \"Shawn Malone\") on fretless bass guitar. In 1995, the album was released in France by the Dutch label CNR Music. This version included a bonus CD with acoustic material titled The Closing of the Pale Blue Eyes. Both recordings are available as free digital downloads from Wesley's official website. == Track listing == # \"Into the night\" \u2013 04:46 # \"None so beautiful\" \u2013 04:26 # \"Thirteen days\" \u2013 04:50 # \"Waiting for the sun\" \u2013 05:01 # \"She said no\" \u2013 03:41 # \"The last light\" \u2013 04:48 # \"To reach out\" \u2013 05:27 # \"Rome is burning\" \u2013 03:04 # \"Our hero\" \u2013 04:39 # \"What you really want\" \u2013 04:11 # \"Cuttin the tree\" \u2013 04:09 # \"Silver\" \u2013 03:42 Total time 52:57 All songs written by John Wesley, except \"Into the Night\" and \"Waiting for the sun\", written by John Wesley and Paul Prator. ===The Closing of the Pale Blue Eyes (bonus disc of 1995 CNR Music release) === # \"Right Here Inside Me\" \u2013 03:57 # \"To Share A Dream\" \u2013 01:35 # \"Alone - Together\" \u2013 02:46 # \"In Ohio\" \u2013 02:33 # \"Say Goodbye To The Pale Blue Eyes\" \u2013 03:09 # \"A Long Way Down\" \u2013 03:50 # \"Death Of A Friend\" \u2013 02:27 # \"Right Here Beside Me\" \u2013 02:41 == Personnel == * John Wesley - guitars and vocals * Mark Kelly - keyboards and piano * Mark Prator - drums and percussion * Dave Wehner - bass guitar * Ian Mosley - drums on \"None so beautiful\", \"Thirteen days\", * Steve Rothery - guitar solo on \"Thirteen days\", * Sean Malone - fretless bass guitar, * Paul Prator - keyboards on \"Into the Night\", \"What you really want\", \"To reach out\". * Russell Farrow - crash chords on \"The Last Light\" * Leroy Myers - backing Vocals on \"The Last Light\", \"Waiting for the sun\". * Brian Benscoter - percussion on \"None so beautiful\" == External links == * * == References == Category:1994 albums ",
