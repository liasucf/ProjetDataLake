He became a monk later in his life and founded a Benedictine abbey at Renty. Bertulf migrated to the County of Artois, where he converted to Christianity. For years he was steward to Count Lambert, whom he served so faithfully that the Count entrusted the administration of his entire estate to Bertulf and gave him the land of Renty, where Bertoul later built a monastery. Upon his benefactor's death, Bertoul became a monk and retired there as abbot. He died a monk in Artois.Attwater2, Benedictines, Coulson, Encyclopedia In art, Saint Bertulf is shown sheltered from the rain by an eagle.
