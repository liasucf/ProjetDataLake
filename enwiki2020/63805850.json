The union was established in April 1948 as the Trade Union Federation of PTT Workers, and affiliated to Workers' Force (FO). It brought together two groups which had in 1947 split from the General Confederation of Labour-affiliated National Federation of PTT Workers: The Autonomous PTT Trade Union Federation, led by Camille Mourgu\u00e8s, and the Independent Federation of PTTs, led by Dominique Grimaldi. Membership of the union grew from 26,500 in 1950, to a claimed 60,000 in 1977. By 1995, it was 30,000. In 2000, the union renamed itself as \"FO Communication\". ==General Secretaries== :1948: Camille Mourgu\u00e8s :1956: :1969: Andr\u00e9 Fossat :1978: Claude Pitous :1982: Jacques Mar\u00e7ot :1993: Jacques Lemercier :2000s: :2010s: Nicolas Galepides ==External links== * ==References== Category:Communications trade unions Category:Trade unions established in 1948 Category:Trade unions in France ",
