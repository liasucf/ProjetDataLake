    "text": "Marcus Welby, M.D. is an American medical drama television program that aired Tuesdays at 10:00\u201311:00 pm (EST) on ABC from September 23, 1969, to July 29, 1976. It starred Robert Young as the title character, a family practitioner with a kind bedside manner, who was on a first-name basis with many of his patients (and who also made house calls), James Brolin, as Steve Kiley, M.D, a younger doctor who was Welby's partner, and Elena Verdugo, who played Welby and Kiley's dedicated and loving nurse and office manager, Consuelo Lopez. Marcus Welby, M.D., was produced by David Victor and David J. O'Connell. The pilot, \"A Matter of Humanities\", had aired as an ABC Movie of the Week on March 26, 1969. ==Overview== As with most medical dramas of the day, the plots often concerned a professional conflict between well-meaning physicians. Here, Welby's unorthodox way of treating patients was pitted against the more straight-laced methods of Kiley (Brolin). The catch with this particular program was that the roles were reversed in that Kiley was much younger than Welby. The opening credits of each episode reminded viewers of the generation gap between the two doctors, Welby driving his sedan and Kiley riding a motorcycle. Welby had served in the US Navy as a doctor during the war, and was a widower. He owned a sailboat and enjoyed the ocean. In an early example of product placement on television, Welby consumed many bottles of high- gravity malt liquor below deck and would, at times, gather inspiration for his novel treatments after one of these nautical benders. The doctors worked alongside each other in their private practice in Santa Monica, California, regularly working in conjunction with the nearby Lang Memorial Hospital (this was later revealed in exterior shots to be the real-life Saint John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica). At the office, their loyal secretary-nurse and friend was Consuelo Lopez (Verdugo). Other characters that appeared throughout the series included Dr. Welby's frequent girlfriend Myra Sherwood (Anne Baxter), his daughter Sandy (first Christine Belford then Anne Schedeen) and her son Phil (Gavin Brendan), and Kathleen Faverty (Sharon Gless), an assistant program director at the hospital, who worked closely with Welby and Kiley. Kiley met and married public relations director Janet Blake (played by Pamela Hensley) in 1975, at the beginning of the show's final season on the air. Young and Wyatt on Marcus Welby, M.D. In the episode \"Designs\" (which aired on March 12, 1974), Young was reunited with his Father Knows Best co- star, Jane Wyatt; she played a fashion designer whose marriage to an embittered paraplegic led her to fall in love with the doctor while keeping her marriage a secret most of the episode. ==Medical features== Its handling of many varied medical cases \u2013 some common, some uncommon \u2013 made it an instant hit for ABC. Story lines included impotence, depression, brain damage, breast cancer, mononucleosis, teenaged obesity, juvenile diabetes, sexually transmitted diseases, epilepsy, learning disabilities, leukemia, haemophilia, paraplegia, dysautonomia, rape, Alzheimer's disease, and addiction to painkillers, among others. At its second season (1970\u20131971), it ranked number one in the Nielsen ratings, becoming the first ABC show to top the list. The same year, both Young and Brolin won Emmy Awards for their work, as did the show for Outstanding Dramatic Series. Young won a Golden Globe in 1972 for his performance. Members of the American Academy of Family Physicians served as technical advisers for the series and reviewed every script for medical accuracy. ==Politics== The show was not afraid to tackle social issues. The 1973 episode \"The Other Martin Loring\", was about a middle-aged man whom Welby advised to resist his homosexual impulses. The Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) zapped ABC, occupied its New York headquarters and picketed.Capsuto, p. 92 The next year, \"The Outrage\" was a story of a teenaged student who was sexually assaulted by his male teacher, showing homosexuality with pedophilia. Seven sponsors refused to buy television advertising time, and 17 television network affiliates refused to air the episode.Capsuto, pp. 106\u2013109Tropiano, pp. 18\u201321 This was the first known instance of network affiliates refusing a network episode in response to protests.Alwood, p. 150 In addition, an episode dealing with abortion was refused by San Diego area ABC affiliate XETV, a station licensed to Tijuana across the border in Mexico, due to that country's views on the practice at the time. ==Episodes== Robert Young, James Brolin, Elena Verdugo (1971) ===Crossovers with Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law=== During its run, Marcus Welby, M.D. had two crossover stories with its legal spin-off series Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law. In \"Men Who Care\", Marshall defends the father of Welby's patient when the man is accused of murdering his daughter's boyfriend. In \"I've Promised You a Father\", Marshall defends Kiley in a paternity suit filed by a nurse claiming that Kiley is the father of her child. ==Nielsen ratings== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Season !!
