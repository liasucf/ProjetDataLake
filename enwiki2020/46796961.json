    "text": "In Ancient Egyptian religion, Medjed is a god who is mentioned in the Book of the Dead. ==Book of the Dead== Spell 17 of the Book of the Dead mentions, amongst many other obscure gods, one Medjed (meaning \"The Smiter\"), in the following line: :I know the name of that Smiter among them, who belongs to the House of Osiris, who shoots with his eye, yet is unseen. According to John Taylor of the British Museum, nothing else is known about Medjed. ==New Kingdom \"Papyri\"== Medjed is also mentioned in the New Kingdom Papyri, known as the \"Theban Recenscion of the Book of the Dead\". It states, \"I know the being M\u0101tchet [Medjed] who is among them in the House of Osiris, shooting rays of light from [his] eye, but who himself is unseen. He goeth round about heaven robed in the flame of his mouth, commanding H\u0101pi (god of the annual flooding of the Nile), but remaining himself unseen.\u201d ==In popular culture== In the illustration to the spell on sheet 76 of the Greenfield papyrus, a figure thought to be Medjed is depicted as a figure in a conical covering, except for the eyes and feet. After this papyrus illustration was exhibited in 2012 at the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo and the Fukuoka Museum of Art, Medjed became a sensation on Japanese social media. The god was embraced by Japanese popular culture, including as an internet meme and as a character in video games.
