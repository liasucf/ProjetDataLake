    "text": "Sarcolobus globosus is a twining shrub native to tropical regions of Asia including India, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar-Burma, the Philippines and Indonesia. In India the plant is found in the mangrove forests of West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Sundarbans and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Traditional practices in these regions use the leaves and rhizomes as medicine; and the seeds are poisonous and used as bait to kill dogs and wild animals. ==Description== The plant is a twining shrub with stout glabrous branches, root-stock thick, and fleshy; roots thick. Leaves are simple, opposite, 3-6x2-4.5 cm, ovate or oblong, thick and fleshy, acute or obtuse at apex, rounded at base. Inflorescence cymose. Flowers small, starry, crowded, in axillary corymbose cymes, 2\u20133 mm across; corolla purplish, lobes pubescent inside. Follicles brown, 4\u20135 cm across, sub-globose; seeds are many and flattened. Cotyledons often large, radicle terete. In the mangroves of India it is often found in association with and climbing on Phoenix paludosa. Flowering and fruiting occur during June\u2013September, October\u2013January, respectively. In Andhra Pradesh fruiting is recorded as early as during August\u2013October. ==Chemical constituents== S. globosus is a rich source of flavonoids, rotenoids and phenolyc glycosides.Wangensteen H, Alamgir M, Duong GM, Gr\u00f8nhaug TE, Samuelsen AB, Malterud KE (2009). Chemical and biological studies of medicinal plants from the Sundarbans mangrove forest. In:Advances in Phytotherapy Research (M Eddouks, ed). Research Signpost,Kerala, India, pp. 59-78. Rotenoids such as tephrosin, 12aalpha-hydroxydeguelin, 11-hydroxytephrosin, 12a-hydroxyrotenone, 12aalpha-hydroxyrotenone, 6aalpha,12aalpha-12a-hydroxyelliptone, 6a,12a-dehydrodeguelin, and 13-homo-13-oxa-6a,12a-dehydrodeguelin, villosinol and 6-oxo-6a,12a-dehydrodeguelin are identified. Isoflavones like barbigerone, genistin and a chromone 6,7-dimethoxy-2,3-dihydrochromone were identified. The isoflavone sarcolobone and the rotenoid sarcolobin were isolated from the stem and are unique to the species. Four phenolic glycosides including vanillic acid 4-O-beta-d-glucoside, glucosyringic acid, tachioside and isotachioside are reported. ==Uses== ===Poison=== S. globosus is listed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as poisonous plant. The seeds are known to be highly toxic to mammals. Native people of Asia widely use it to kill dogs and wild animals. It was demonstrated that it effectively killed cats. The plant extract causes inhibition of the neuro-muscular system. The symptoms of poisoning in animals include blood urine and nephrosis.Radostits OM, Arundel JH, Gay CC (2000). Veterinary Medicine: A textbook of the diseases of cattle, horses, sheep, pigs and goats (10th edn). Saunders Ltd., p. 1684. ===Medicine=== The plant has been used as an herbal medicine for treatment of rheumatism, dengue and fever. The plant is known to contain barbigerone which is validated to have significant antioxidant property, highly effective against the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and with anti-cancer potential as it causes apoptosis of murine lung-cancer cells. ==See also== *Barbigerone == References == == External links == * Wikispecies *bioSearch, Bioinformatics Centre, National Institute of Oceanography * *ZipcodeZoo *FDA Poisonous Plant Database Category:Asclepiadoideae Category:Flora of China Category:Flora of tropical Asia ",
