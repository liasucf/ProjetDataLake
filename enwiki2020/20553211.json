    "text": "Werner Reinhart (19 March 1884 \u2013 29 August 1951) was a Swiss merchant, philanthropist, amateur clarinetist, and patron of composers and writers, particularly Igor Stravinsky and Rainer Maria Rilke. Reinhart knew and corresponded with many of the great names of the early-mid 20th century in the European artistic and musical world, and his Villa Rychenberg in Winterthur became an international meeting point for musicians and writers. He was sometimes referred to as \"the Winterthur Maecenas\". Alice Bailly named Werner Reinhart \"L'homme aux mains d'or\" \u2013 the man with the golden hands,Biblioth\u00e8que du Gymnase de Beaulieu and her 1920 portrait of him is called \"The Man with the Golden Heart\".DeBartha Galerie Senarclens Oskar Kokoschka also painted his portrait in 1947. Oskar Kokoschka: Exile and new home 1938\u20131980 Werner Reinhart inherited his wealth from the Volkart family business, based in Winterthur, which he ran together with his elder brother Georg. Reinhart and Hermann Scherchen played a leading role in shaping the musical life of Winterthur between 1922 and 1950, the emphasis being on contemporary music, and they were instrumental in numerous premieres being performed there. Scherchen was one of many people whom Reinhart patronised, not least in Scherchen's case because he had to pay alimony to no less than five ex- wives.Michael Kater, The Twisted Muse ==People Reinhart supported and assisted== ===Othmar Schoeck=== Othmar Schoeck was left destitute when World War I broke out. His appointment as conductor of the St. Gallen Symphony Orchestra (with special permission to remain resident in Z\u00fcrich), combined with the annuity Werner Reinhart gave him from 1916 onwards, allowed Schoeck to give up his jobs as chorus director and to compose more or less undisturbed.The Schoeck Home Page Schoeck was not given to overt signs of gratitude, but he dedicated to Werner Reinhart the following works: * Gaselen, 10 poems by Gottfried Keller, Op. 38 (1923), for baritone, flute, oboe, bass clarinet, trumpet, percussion and piano * the Sonata for Bass Clarinet and Piano, Op. 41 (1927\u201328) * the Suite in A flat for Strings, Op. 59 (1945).Theodore Front Musical Literature ===Igor Stravinsky=== Igor Stravinsky approached Reinhart for financial assistance when he was writing Histoire du soldat (The Soldier's Tale). The first performance was conducted by Ernest Ansermet on 28 September 1918, at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal de Lausanne. Werner Reinhart sponsored this performance, and to a large degree underwrote it. In gratitude, Stravinsky dedicated the work to Reinhart,Ragtime Ensemble presents The Soldier's Tale and even gave him the original manuscript.Concert Artists Guild The composer, the antiquarian and the go-between Reinhart continued his support of Stravinsky's work in 1919 by funding a series of concerts of his recent chamber music.Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center These included a suite of five numbers from The Soldier's Tale, arranged for clarinet, violin, and piano, which was a nod to Reinhart, who was an excellent amateur clarinetist. The suite was first performed on 8 November 1919, in Lausanne, long before the better-known suite for the seven original instruments became widely known.A Musical Feast Stravinsky dedicated his Three Pieces for Clarinet to Reinhart, in gratitude for his ongoing support.naxos Philharmonic Society Presents Reinhart founded a music library of Stravinskiana at his home in Winterthur.Kuko.com ===Rainer Maria Rilke=== In 1919, Rainer Maria Rilke travelled to Switzerland from Munich. The outward motive was an invitation to lecture in Z\u00fcrich, but the real reason was the wish to escape the post-war chaos and take up once again his work on the Duino Elegies. The search for a suitable and affordable residence proved to be very difficult and Rilke lived in various places. Only in the summer of 1921 was he able to find a permanent abode in the Chateau de Muzot in the commune of Veyras, close to Sierre in Valais. It was at Muzot, in February 1922, that Rilke, in a storm of inspiration, wrote most of the fifty-five Sonnets to Orpheus and several smaller collections of poems.Bookrags In May 1922, after deciding he could afford the cost of considerable necessary renovation, Werner Reinhart bought Muzot so that Rilke could live there rent-free, and became Rilke's patron.Ralph Freedman, Life of a Poet Here Rilke completed his greatest work, the Duino Elegies. During this time, Reinhart introduced Rilke to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, the Australian violinist Alma Moodie.R. M. Rilke: Music as Metaphor Rilke was so impressed with her playing that he wrote in a letter: What a sound, what richness, what determination. That and the \"Sonnets to Orpheus\", those were two strings of the same voice. And she plays mostly Bach! Muzot has received its musical christening....Photo and descriptionRainer Maria Rilke: a brief biographical overview ===Paul Hindemith=== Paul Hindemith's Clarinet Quintet, first performed at the ISCM Festival in Salzburg on 7 August 1923, was dedicated to Werner Reinhart, as was his Canon in Three Voices Sine musica nulla disciplina (1944). Reinhart told Gertrud Hindemith \"there was something Mozartian\" about her husband's writing Trauermusik in less than a day in London after the death of King George V, and premiering it the same evening. \"I know no one else today who could do that\", he said.Michael Steinberg, The Concerto ===Ernst Krenek=== Ernst Krenek and his then wife Anna Mahler (daughter of Gustav Mahler) lived in Zurich 1924-25, at Reinhart's invitation.Universal EditionOf mountains and modernism: Othmar Schoeck Their marriage collapsed, however, and Krenek had a brief affair with Alma Moodie. While this relationship did not last, Krenek was so grateful for Moodie's introduction to Reinhart's assistance that he dedicated his Violin Concerto No. 1, Op. 29, to her. His Kleine Suite, Op. 28 (1924) was written for Reinhart himself. ===Arthur Honegger=== Werner Reinhart was the primary financial supporter of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Jorat, where Arthur Honegger's oratorio Le Roi David premiered, and corresponded with its owner Ren\u00e9 Morax.Contemporary Music in a well-established Genre Honegger's Sonatine for Clarinet and Piano (1921\u201322) was written for Reinhart.Colin James Lawson, The Cambridge Companion to the Clarinet Honegger's Pastorale d\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 was played in Berlin on 9 November 1922, conducted by Bernhard Seidmann. This was financially supported by Werner Reinhart, who also urged Honegger to program Horace victorieux, a work he believed to be far more important.questia ===Anton Webern=== It was thanks to Werner Reinhart that Anton Webern, who was living in political isolation in Austria, was able to attend the premiere of his Variations for Orchestra, Op. 30 in Winterthur in 1943. Reinhart invested all the financial and diplomatic means at his disposal to enable Webern to travel to Switzerland. In return for this support, Webern dedicated the work to him. ==Other dedications== * In 1944, Frank Martin wrote a \"Canon for Werner Reinhart\" for eight voices (SSAATTBB), to a text by Pierre de Ronsard. * Adolf Busch's Sonata for solo bass clarinet was written for Reinhart. * Hermann Burte dedicated Gedichte Voltaires to Reinhart. * Richard Strauss dedicated his Sonatina no. 2 \"Fr\u00f6hliche Werkstatt\" f\u00fcr 16 Blasinstrumente (a.k.a.
