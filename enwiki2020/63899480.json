It included construction of a large complex to house the upper and middle malls along with the blue and red car parks. In addition to this, an existing open shopping precinct on Kirgate originally opened in 1972 was roofed and extensively updated to become the lower mall, and the existing Almhouse Lane multi-storey was adapted to become the green car park. It was the first of its kind in the UK, containing features such as a food court inspired by malls in the United States and its major popularity upon opening meant there were queues even to enter the centre. The centre was extensively refurbished in 2008 at a cost of \u00a32.5 million. The improvements included a redesign of the centre's entrances as well as new lifts (replacing the original glass wall-climber lift that was the first in the UK). The Ridings Centre was purchased in 2015 by NewRiver. This was followed by a \u00a35 million renovation in 2017 which included a new food court and space for 'pop-up' shops. ==Awards== *The Ridings Centre won the award for 'European Shopping Centre Of The Year' on numerous occasions. *In 2018 the centre won the Revo Purple Apple Marketing Awards, obtaining a Golden Apple Award. ==Transport connections== Ridings Centre Blue Car Park The Ridings Centre is located near Wakefield Westgate and Wakefield Kirkgate railway stations as well as Wakefield Bus Station.
