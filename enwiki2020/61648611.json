The office may or may not have existed. == Third period (217\u201358 BC) == During this period, the governors of Cyprus bore the title of strategos kai archiereus (general and high priest). After 142 BC, they also bore the title of nauarchos (admiral). Governors usually held the rank of syngenes (royal kinsman) in the aulic titulature.
