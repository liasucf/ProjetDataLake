It is sometimes referred to as Lord Howe Atoll, not to be confused with Lord Howe Island. Geographically it belongs to a scattered group of three atolls which includes nearby Nukumanu Atoll and the wholly submerged Roncador Reef located to the south.Remote Atolls and Offshore Islands of PNG and the Solomons ==Description== Administratively Ontong Java belongs to the Solomon Islands. As an outlying part of Malaita Province, it forms the northernmost tract of land of this state, over north of Santa Isabel Island. The closest land, however, is Nukumanu Atoll, which lies only due north of Ontong Java's northern tip and, though historically closely related to Ontong Java, is now under the administration of Papua New Guinea. Ontong Java is roughly boot-shaped. The entire size of the atoll is , but there are only of land, spread out over 122 small islands. The islands are mostly low- lying coral formations, the highest elevation being . Approximately 2000 people live on the atoll. There are two main villages where the population is concentrated with 1,386 on the island of Luaniua in the eastern end and 689 on Pelau in the northeast. ==History== Nautical Chart of Ontong Java Atoll, 1934 The islands were first inhabited by Polynesians approximately 2000 years ago. The main cultural and commercial exchanges took place with the inhabitants of neighboring Nukumanu Atoll, with whom Ontong Java people share many cultural affinities.Sarfert, Ernst, and Hans Damm. \"Luangiua und Nukumanu.\" Ergebnisse der S\u00fcdsee Expedition, 1908-1910. Hamburg 1931. Vol I It is likely that first European sighting was by the Spanish expedition of \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a on 1 February 1568. It was charted by them as Bajos de la Candelaria (shoals of Our Lady of Candlemas in Spanish).Sharp, Andrew The discovery of the Pacific Islands Oxford, 1960, pp.43,44.Brand, Donald D. The Pacific Basin: A History of its Geographical Explorations The American Geographical Society, New York, 1967, p.133. The following verifiable sighting by Europeans was by Abel Tasman in 1643 who named it Ontong Java; however, it wasn't until 1791 that Europeans set foot on the islands, when Capt. John Hunter (later Governor of New South Wales) named it Lord Howe Atoll. In 1893 the islands were annexed by Germany and ceded to Great Britain in 1899. Today the atoll's inhabitants make a subsistence living by means of coconut and taro (root) cultivation, as well as fishing. Until a ban in 2005, the primary source of income was beche de mer and trochus shells, which were shipped to Hong Kong. The inhabitants are also involved in copra production. It also has a prolific number of sea birds, including the black-naped tern, which uses Ontong Java Atoll as a breeding site. ==Anthropology and linguistics== Large general cemetery, Luaniua, Ontong Java. Picture by George Brown (missionary) (1835 \u2013 1917). Ontong Java is a Polynesian outlier. The inhabitants retain a Polynesian character despite their location in the Melanesian Archipelago of the Solomon Islands. In former times both men and women wore elaborate tattoos all over their bodies.Tattoo history of Western Oceania Two dialects of one language are spoken in this atoll, Luangiua and Pelau. This language belongs to the Polynesian stock.Ethnologue - Ontong Java Language Ontong Java was visited by English missionary George Brown in mid 19th century. Brown described the population as PolynesianGeorge Brown, Melanesians and Polynesians, p. 414, and referred to the place as Lua Niua. He recorded the existence of a two-class system in Ontong Java and, based on it, inferred that it was probable that exogamous classes formerly existed in Samoa as well.Introduction to the History of Religions - Handbooks on the History of Religions, Volume IV, Crawford Howell Toy The first detailed research on Ontong Java's inhabitants, however, was conducted by German ethnographers Ernst Sarfert and Hans Damm, during a German scientific expedition of the Southern Seas that took place in 1908-1910. This expedition visited both Ontong Java and neighboring Nukumanu Atoll, where they also carried out their research. Their work, \"Luangiua und Nukumanu\" was published in 1931. Sarfert and Damm claimed that both names of the atoll, Lord Howe and Ontong Java, were incorrect and called this atoll Luangiua in their works. Jack London first called this atoll \"Oolong\".Gary Riedl & Thomas R. Tietze (editors), Jack London's Tales of Cannibals and Headhunters: Nine South Seas Stories by America's Master of Adventure Later he would write in one of his novels: Ontong Java was later visited by Sydney University anthropologist Herbert Ian Hogbin in 1927.Hogbin, H.
