After marrying M. Bigot, she moved to Vienna in 1804, where she lived for five years. She was highly accomplished at the keyboard and played for Haydn, who exclaimed, \"Oh, my dear child, I did not write this music - it is you who have composed it!\" He wrote on the sheet from which she played, \"On 20 February 1805, Joseph Haydn was happy.\" She became a friend of Salieri. Her husband being the librarian of Count Razumovsky, she became friendly with Beethoven, who admired her playing. She was the first to play for him, from the autograph, his newly written Appassionata Sonata,Mitchell, Mark Lindsey, Virtuosi: a defense and a (sometimes erotic) celebration of great pianists, Indiana University Press, 2001, p. 159. impressing him so much that he told her, \"That is not exactly the character I wanted to give this piece; but go right on. If it is not wholly mine it is something better.\"Forbes, Elliot, Thayer's Life of Beethoven, Part 1, Princeton University Press, 1992, p. 412-413.

I should never want to fill my heart with distrust towards those who may chance some day to share my fate with me, and thus destroy the loveliest and purest life for myself.\"Kalischer, Alfred Christlieb, Beethoven's Letters V1: A Critical Edition, with Explanatory Notes, Kessinger Publishing, LLC (2008)p. 137.
