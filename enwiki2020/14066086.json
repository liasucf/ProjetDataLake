Ebisu Circuit was designed and built by drift driver Nobushige Kumakubo, and is one of the premier drifting-based race tracks in the world. However, Nobushige also holds other non-drifting motorsport events at Ebisu including motorcycle races, karting, endurance races, FJ1600 open-wheel car races, and in previous years events like \"Big-X\". The complex also has a Safari park. ==References== ==See also== ==External links== *Official web site (Japanese) Category:Motorsport venues in Japan Category:Sports venues in Fukushima Prefecture Category:Nihonmatsu, Fukushima ",
