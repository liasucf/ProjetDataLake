Around Christmastime 1609, Sir Edward Herbert fought with a Scottish gentleman who had snatched a ribbon from her hair in a back room of the queen's lodgings at Greenwich Palace.

John Chamberlain recorded that the Scottish man was an usher to the queen named \"Boghvan\", also recorded as \"Jacques Bochan\".Norman Egbert McClure, Letters of John Chamberlain, vol. 1 (Philadelphia, 1939), p. 296: HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 24 (London, 1976), p. 67. The queen's secretary William Fowler dedicated poems to her, the Meditation upon Virgin Maryes Hatt, and Aetna which includes her name; \"My harte as Aetna burnes, and suffers MORE / Paines in my MIDDLE than ever MARY proved\", and devised an Italian anagram \"Madre di mill'amori\", the mother of a thousand loves.Sara M. Dunnigan, Eros and Poetry at the Courts of Mary Queen of Scots and James VI (Basingstoke, 2002), p. 208 fn. 6: Alastair Fowler, Literary names: Personal names (Oxford, 2012), p. 84: R. D. S.

After Vincent Skinner's death , her mother Elizabeth Foukes seems also to have joined the queen's household. On 29 April 1617 Middlemore was granted a licence by the king to have workmen seek treasure in Glastonbury Abbey, St Albans Abbey, Bury St Edmunds Abbey, and Romsey Abbey.Thomas Rymer, Foedera, vol. 7 part 3 (Hague, 1741), pp. 9-11.

The gift has sometimes been assumed to be intended for the queen, but it may be connected with the financial ruin and death of her step-father Sir Vincent Skinner, who had been building a country house at Thornton Abbey.'Thornton Abbey, history' English Heritage; Mark Girouard, Elizabethan Architecture (Yale, 2009), pp. 412-3. Around this time, her mother joined the queen's household.See H. M.
