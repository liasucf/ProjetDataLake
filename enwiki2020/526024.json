    "text": "Riksgr\u00e4nsen, The National Border in Swedish, is a ski-resort in Kiruna Municipality, Lappland, Sweden, 200 km north of the Arctic Circle. The skiing season is from February to June. From end of May the lifts operate under the midnight sun. Riksgr\u00e4nsen is a popular location for the winter testing of pre- production cars by various European manufacturers. Photo-snipers are prevalent, attempting to get the first spy-shots of new models, though their activities are frowned upon by local hoteliers who value the custom of the manufacturers. The same manufacturers frequently use the location for winter launches, bringing journalists from across the world to drive the new cars on snow-covered roads and on courses specially prepared on frozen lakes.

Summers do remain cool in spite of the midnight sun due to similar marine effects. With prevailing low-pressure systems taking precedence, the climate is snowy and cloudy. The deep snow cover and the time it takes for thawing prolongs the skiing season to the midnight sun window. ==References== ==External links== *Riksgr\u00e4nsen Category:Lapland (Sweden) Category:Ski areas and resorts in Sweden Category:Buildings and structures in Norrbotten County Category:Tourist attractions in Norrbotten County ",
