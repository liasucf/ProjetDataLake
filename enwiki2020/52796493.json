    "text": "Urania is the debut studio album by the Mexican progressive rock band Tangerine Circus. The album, named after the former name of the band, and featuring a cover image consisting on blue and yellow fractals by Marco del Moral Argumedo, was recorded from June 2013 to December 2014 and released on 21 May 2015. It was produced, mixed and mastered by the band's keyboardist Eduardo Marin\u00e9 and released in 2015 on digital stores. == Background == Keyboardist Eduardo Marin\u00e9, drummer Daniel Hern\u00e1ndez and bassist Luis Mauricio S\u00e1nchez met in middle school in 2005, starting a friendship in a short period of time. They shared a common love for bands like Dream Theater and Iron Maiden, which lead to the formation of their first band when they were at age 17, mainly playing covers of some artists they used to listen like M\u00e4go de Oz and Iron Maiden. Guitar player Daniel Moreno, S\u00e1nchez long-time friend, joined the band, which would be later named Metalurgia, which served as an early musical output for the musicians. In 2008, Hern\u00e1ndez and Marin\u00e9 decided they wanted to bring it up a notch and create a progressive metal project in the vein of bands like Symphony X and Dream Theater, parallel to Metalurgia. Guitarist Francesc Messeguer, Hern\u00e1ndez long-time friend, became part of this band, anda a couple of months later S\u00e1nchez would also join the new progressive metal path, naming the project Urania, which would later become the title of their debut album. == Recording == In 2009, the band changed their name to Tangerine Circus and began to work on their first songs. Those songs would later on become Urania, excluding \"Into Her Traveling Mind\", which was written almost 4 years later. In early 2013, Marin\u00e9 proposed that Urania got re-recorded in his newly founded studio. With the band self-producing its own work and Marin\u00e9 being in charge of engineering and mixing, Tangerine Circus reached a new level of control and detail with their work. It took them almost a year and a half to re-record and re-arrange their existing material into their final forms. \"Into Her Traveling Mind\", the opening song from Urania, was composed during that time due to a lack of a heavy and exciting opening for the record. \"The Wings\", the longest song on the album and composed of four parts, is slightly based on the Greek myth of Icarus. == Release == Urania was first released digitally on streaming services and digital stores on 21 May 2015. === Packaging === In 2016, the album, along with The Conspiracy Chronicles, was released as a two-disc set as a less expensive presentation to introduce their debut works to the public. The cover art of this set consists on Tangerine Circus's logo over a black background. == Live performances == Although there was never an official tour of the album, the band gigged in Mexico City to promote the album. They played dates in State of Mexico and Quer\u00e9taro, promoting also their next release The Conspiracy Chronicles. == Track listing == All music composed by Eduardo Marin\u00e9, Francesc Messeguer, and Daniel Hern\u00e1ndez, except where noted. All lyrics written by Marin\u00e9, except \"A Passage Through My Past Life\" written by Marin\u00e9 and Hern\u00e1ndez. == Personnel == Tangerine Circus * Francesc Messeguer \u2013 lead guitar, vocals * Luis Mauricio S\u00e1nchez \u2013 bass guitar, vocals * Eduardo Marin\u00e9 \u2013 Keyboards, vocals * Daniel Hern\u00e1ndez \u2013 drums, vocals Production * Eduardo Marin\u00e9 - Production, engineering, mixing, mastering * Marco del Moral Argumedo - cover == References == Category:2015 debut albums Category:Tangerine Circus albums ",
