The name of the runemaster is unknown, and the stone is classified as being in runestone style Pr2,Project Samnordisk Runtextdatabas Svensk - Rundata entry for U 35. which is also known as the Ringerike style. The name Adils or A\u00f0\u00edsl from the runic text appears to have been a rather rare name, during both the Viking Age and the Middle Ages. It does not appear in any other Swedish runic inscription. The name does appear in Ynglingatal, Norse sagas, and Beowulf as belonging to a Swedish king during the sixth century named Eadgils. It also appears on one of the Manx Runestones, Kirk Michael MM 130. The runic text states that the stone is a memorial by three sons to their father Vigisl, who is described as being the husband of \u00c4rnfrids. By referring to her in this manner, the text is probably indicating that she was also deceased when the stone was raised. ==Inscription== A transliteration of the runic text into Latin letters is: :a\u00feisl : auk : ays- : auk : ---fr : \u00feai\u0280 : litu : raisa : stain : \u00feinsa : at : uikisl : fa\u00feur : sin : boanta : irfri\u00fea\u0280 ==Photographs== File:Runsten Uppland 35 closeuo.jpg|Runestone detail.
