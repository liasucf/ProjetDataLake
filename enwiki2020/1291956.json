He is a professor and the Vice Chair of the Design Media Arts department at UCLA, director of the Institute for Technology and Aesthetics (ITA), and founder of mediawork: The Southern California New Media Group. Lunenfeld is a leading figure in digital aesthetic theory, set on establishing philosophical quandaries regarding digital technology and its role in art, design and culture. Works like Snap to Grid and The Secret War Between Downloading and Uploading incorporate traditional and continental theories of art to account for digital media. His work revolves around the discources of technology, aesthetics, and cultural theory, establishing the complexity of digital aesthetics while simultaneously categorizing it. His books include City at the Edge of Forever, Digital_Humanities, USER, Snap to Grid, and The Digital Dialectic. Lunenfeld is the editorial director of the highly designed Mediawork pamphlet series for the MIT Press. The series features commissioned writings that weave life stories into \"theoretical and critical praxis.\" These award-winning \"theoretical fetish objects\" cover the intersections of art, design, technology, and market culture.

Katherine Hayles, designed by Anne Burdick; Rhythm Science (2004) by Paul D. Miller aka DJ Spooky that Subliminal Kid, designed by COMA; and, Shaping Things (2005) by Bruce Sterling, designed by Lorraine Wild. Lev Manovich, the author of The Language of New Media, lauded these 100 page \"mind bombs\" in the tradition of McLuhan and Fiore\u00b9s The Medium is the Massage as a new operating system for the book.
