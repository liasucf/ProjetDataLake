The ride takes guests through the Kasvapan River of Pandora from the 2009 film Avatar, showcasing native animals and bioluminescent flora, with inclusion of Audio-animatronics. ==The Shaman's Song== The Na'vi Shaman of Songs featured in the attraction is Disney's most advanced Audio-Animatronic to date. There is a song the Shaman of Songs sings during the ride in the Na'vi language. Dr. Paul Frommer, the creator of the Na'vi language, posted the lyrics the shaman sings on his blog. The Na'vi lyrics and their English translation are as follows: {| class=\"wikitable\" !Na'vi - \"Way Tiretu\u00e4\" !English - \"The Shaman's Song\" |- |1 Ma Na\u2019r\u00ecng alor, M\u00ec Na\u2019r\u00ecng lu tsngawpay.
