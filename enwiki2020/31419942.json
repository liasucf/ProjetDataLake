It is situated between the Karaburun Peninsula, Turkey in the west, and the district of Fo\u00e7a in the east. Stretching over a length of c. in north-south direction, it is Turkey's fourth largest island, and its third largest in the Aegean Sea. The island has been called by many names. Its ancient Greek name was Drymoussa (\u0394\u03c1\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1), and it is also known under its later Greek names of Makronisi (\"long island\") or Englezonisi (\"Englishmen's island\"),(16 Nov 2012).

To its south are several smaller islets, including Yass\u0131ca. It has also been called \"Chustan Island\" (or Keustan).Mediterranean Pilot, Volume 4, pp. 191-92 (4th ed. 1908) \"Uzunada\" is also the name of several other, smaller islets along the Turkish Aegean coast. Uzunada is currently closed to settlements due to military activities. ==History== Thucydides briefly mentions Drymoussa as a location where some ships of Astyochus put in for eight days during a period of high winds in the 20th year of the Peloponnesian War.Thucydides, 8.31 (\" He was himself carried to Phocaea and Cym\u00e8, and the remainder of the fleet put into the islands, Marathussa, Pel\u00e8, and Drymussa, which lie off Clazomenae. There, being detained eight days by the weather, they spoiled and destroyed part of the property of the Clazomenians which had been deposited in the islands\") After the Treaty of Apamea was concluded in 188 B.C., the city of Clazomenae was awarded the island.A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, Volume 1, p. 632 (1872)Pinkerton, John.
