It was Motonari's first battle.Arita Castle - Kitahiroshima-cho Tourist Information Website (Kitahiroshima-cho Tourism Association) ==Background== In the early 16th century Takeda Motoshige (also known as Motoshigeru), a local lord of Aki Province, accompanied the daimy\u014d \u014cuchi Yoshioki, his liege lord, to restore Ashikaga Yoshitane to the shogunate in Kyoto. At some point around 1515 Motoshige returned to Aki and broke off from the \u014cuchi, changing his allegiance to the Amago.Aki-Takeda family historical background (Hiroshima City Culture Foundation At this time the M\u014dri clan (a vassal of the \u014cuchi), were neighbors of the Takeda in Aki. When M\u014dri Okimoto died in 1516, and was succeeded by his young son Komatsumaru, Takeda Motoshige took advantage of this and, in the following year, gathered an army of 5,000 and in October advanced into the territory of the M\u014dri's Yoshikawa allies and surrounded . A few weeks later, Motoshige dispatched a raid into the M\u014dri clan's territory and set fire to houses in . The M\u014dri clan's response was led by M\u014dri Motonari, younger brother to Okimoto and guardian of Komatsumaru.Gion west community center Web information station (Hiroshima future city creation Foundation people, town network part) ==Battle== With most of the \u014cuchi forces preoccupied in Kyoto with \u014cuchi Yoshioki, the M\u014dri were unable to call on them for assistance, and Motonari instead mobilized his clan and called on their supporters. Motonari was also supported in this by his younger brother, Mototsuna. In total the M\u014dri strength comprised around 850 men, reinforced by 300 from the Yoshikawa, for a total of around 1,000. This force marched towards Arita Castle and on the way encountered the Takeda vanguard of about 500 men, commanded by Kumagai Motonao. The M\u014dri and their allies stood off and engaged the Takeda with archery fire. Kumagai Motonao was in the front ranks and was encouraging his men when he was struck and killed by an arrow. Takeda Motoshige was meanwhile with the main army at Arita Castle. Learning of Motojika's demise, he drew up his forces and marched to engage the smaller M\u014dri resistance. The Takeda encountered the M\u00f4ri and Yoshikawa occupying the opposite bank of the Uchikawa River and a bitter struggle ensued. Heavily outnumbered, the M\u014dri-led forces began to falter and fall back, but they held in place only by Motonari's pleas to stand their ground. Takeda Motoshige himself advanced forward across the river on horseback but was struck by an arrow and killed. The Takeda broke and retreated, leaving Mori Motonari the victor. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Rekishi Gunz\u014d Shirizu No. 49, M\u014dri Senki, Gakken, Japan, 1997 * Arita Castle (\u6709\u7530\u57ce\u5740) \u2013 Kitahiroshima-ch\u014d Tourist Information Website (Kitahiroshima-ch\u014d Tourism Association) ==External links== * Samurai Archives entry for Battle of Arita-Nakaide Arita-Nakaide Arita- Nakaide 1517 Category:1517 in Asia Category:M\u014dri clan ",
