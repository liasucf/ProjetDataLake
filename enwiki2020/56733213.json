    "text": "Rochester Electronics, LLC is a semiconductor distributor and manufacturer headquartered in Newburyport, Massachusetts, United States. The company works with original semiconductor manufacturers as a licensed stocking distributor and manufacturer. They supply semiconductors nearing or at the end of their life cycle. In many cases, these products are no longer available through the original manufacturer and are considered to be obsolete components. == History == Rochester Electronics, LLC was founded in 1981 by Curt Gerrish. Gerrish started his career at Motorola where he remained for two decades. It was at Motorola that he learned of the challenge major corporations and government agencies face when a semiconductor nears the end of its product lifecycle. He found that as quickly as new parts are released to the market they become obsolete and the original manufacturer no longer offers support. Gerrish realized there was a demand for end-of-life semiconductor products, left his position at Motorola and started Rochester Electronics. == Present == Rochester Electronics maintains an inventory of more than 12 billion silicon die in nitrogen-purged dry boxes and warehouses over 15 billion finished devices in temperature and humidity controlled storage facilities at their corporate headquarters campus in Newburyport, Massachusetts. In addition to distributing discontinued semiconductors, they assemble and test products as an authorized manufacturer. They also perform re-creations for parts that no longer have available silicon or design documents. == Locations == Rochester Electronics is headquartered in Newburyport, Massachusetts, United States with regional headquarters located in Singapore and Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom. They have regional sales office locations in Munich, Germany; Shanghai, China; Tokyo, Japan; and Chandler, Arizona and design and technology centers located in Rockville, Maryland and Burnsville, Minnesota. == Semiconductor anti- counterfeit awareness == Since semiconductors are embedded within an incalculable number of critical systems and products such as airplanes, trains, lifesaving health equipment, etc. a failure of one has the potential to pose considerable risk to the health and safety of people around the globe. There have been several documented incidents of counterfeit semiconductors causing and/or potentially causing serious health and safety issues. In 2006, Rochester Electronics initiated the formation of the Semiconductor Industry Association's [SIA] Anti-Counterfeiting Task Force (ACTF). They remain an active participant promoting best procurement practices and the importance of avoiding counterfeit and substandard semiconductors.\u201cWinning the Battle Against Counterfeit Semiconductor Products.
