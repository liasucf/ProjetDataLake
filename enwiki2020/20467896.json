All of the theatre seats were removed and attempts were even made to convert it into a steakhouse. After nearly thirty years of ownership, owner Elias Kalogeras was finally able to sell it in March 2010 to Le Groupe Merveilles Inc. and its owners Ezio Carosielli and Luisa Sassano. Since then, they have acted on their intention to protect the theatre and restore its unique architecture. ==References== ==External links== * *Images Montreal Web page Category:Beaux-Arts architecture in Canada Category:Former cinemas in Montreal Category:Heritage immovables of Quebec Category:Landmarks in Montreal Category:Le Plateau-Mont-Royal Category:Movie palaces Category:National Historic Sites in Quebec Category:Theatres completed in 1924 Category:Theatres in Montreal Category:Theatres on the National Historic Sites of Canada register Category:1924 establishments in Quebec ",
