The name of the Cowanesque River is of Native American origin, derived either from Go-wan-is-que (\"briary or thorn bushy\"), or from Ka-hwe-nes-ka (\"on the long island\"). In Tioga County, the Cowanesque Dam was constructed by the US Army Corps of Engineers in 1980. The dam created Cowanesque Lake, which helps prevent flooding within the valley. The lake also facilitates various forms of recreation; the Tompkins Recreation Area and Campground is located along the lake's north shore, and the south shore hosts two day-use areas. ==See also== *List of rivers of New York *List of rivers of Pennsylvania ==References== ==External links== *US Army Corps of Engineers: Cowanesque Lake Trails *U.S. Geological Survey: PA stream gaging stations Category:Rivers of New York (state) Category:Rivers of Pennsylvania Category:Tributaries of the Chemung River Category:Rivers of Steuben County, New York Category:Rivers of Potter County, Pennsylvania Category:Rivers of Tioga County, Pennsylvania ",
