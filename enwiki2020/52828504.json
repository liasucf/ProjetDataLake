He was the first Italian gallery owner to turn his gallery, dirartecontemporanea, into a virtual exhibition space (dirartecontemporanea 2.0). == Biography == Angelo Marino was born in Frattaminore. In 1991 he founded the gallery dirartecontemporanea in Caserta. In 2001 he organized a group of seminars at the Belvedere San Leucio Caserta, Scavare il futuro: nuovi spazi antichi, in collaboration with Elmar Zorn and City of Caserta. In the same year he collaborated to the installation of the exhibition Plus Ultra at the Royal Palace of Caserta. In 2003 he curated Un anfiteatro per la Pace: stendardi d'artista, an exhibition featuring the work of Carla Accardi, Arcangelo, Angelo Bellobono, Elisabetta Benassi, Dafni & Papadatos, Gianni Dessi, Francesco Impellizzeri, Jannis Kounellis, H.H. Lim, Mafonso, Luigi Mainolfi, Fabio Mauri, Sukran Moral, Hidetoshi Nagasawa, Luigi Ontani and Giacomo Zaza in Piazza Dante in Caserta. In 2005 he organised Il senso del male, an exhibition conceived as a reflection on the tense political climate following 9/11 questioning the meaning of evil at Chiostro di S. Agostino in Caserta. In 2012 Marino converted dirartecontemporanea into a virtual gallery where artists were invited to create works specifically in a web-related context. His idea was to propose a new way to experience contemporary art, without geographical and temporal boundaries. The first exhibition was Max Coppeta: visioni transitorie. Works 2001.2012. In 2013 the project was expanded to the Independent Web-Pavilion of the Indigenous Tribes of the Amazon Basin, a tribute to the tribes of native tribes from the Amazon forest still unaffected by Globalisation. This was followed by the 2nd Independent Web Pavilion: Humanity, Betrayed & Traitors. In 2016 he created the D2.0-box, an exhibition space where a large screen would enable the audience to meet and discuss online exhibitions. Marino was also a friend and mentor of many artists from the Campania region, including Antonio Biasiucci, Nino Longobardi, Mafonso, Piero Chiariello, Arturo Casanova, Luigi Auriemma, Bruno Fermariello, Gloria Pastore and Mariano Filippetta. In 2016 he celebrated this connection in the exhibition Friends Marino died on October 10, 2018. == Exhibitions == * Max Coppeta: visioni transitorie.
