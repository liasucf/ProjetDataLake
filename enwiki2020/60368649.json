    "text": "The Undersea Environment is a 1983 role-playing game supplement for Traveller published by Gamelords. ==Contents== The Undersea Environment is a book that details alien oceans, including factors such as pressure, gravity, temperature, decompression after dives, and undersea communication and combat. ==Reception== Tony Watson reviewed The Mountain Environment and The Undersea Environment together in The Space Gamer No. 72. Watson commented that \"The tight focus and elaborate detail of these supplements is both their strength and weakness. Just about all aspects of mountain and undersea environments are covered, but I wonder just how much of this material is really going to make its way into the average adventure.\" ==Reviews== * Different Worlds #36 (Sept./Oct., 1984) *Dragon #133 ==References== Category:Traveller (role- playing game) supplements ",
