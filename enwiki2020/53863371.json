Pharmacists who join their prefectural and local municipality professional organisations automatically gain membership in the JPA. The association was founded on June 11, 1893 by Ogimachi Sanemasa. ==History== An Edo period pharmacy in Seki-juku (T\u014dkaid\u014d) along the 53 Stations of the T\u014dkaid\u014d In 1874 government announced the development of a modern medical system and grants medication dispensing to pharmacists. The government then announced statutory regulations and guidelines for the handling of chemicals in the pharmaceutical industry, and the professional title Pharmacist was designated. There had been an increasing introduction of Western medicine in Japan since the Meiji restoration in 1868, and a failed attempt by medical practitioners of traditional Kampo (Chinese medicine) in 1890, led to the rise of Western style pharmacy practice. The first Western compounding pharmacy was opened in Japan in 1872 by Arinobu Fukuhara operating under the name Shiseid\u014d. 1893 Japan Pharmaceutical Association was established as the sole national professional association for pharmacists. In 1909, The Japan Pharmaceutical Association was legally incorporated as a public interest corporation. IN 1926, statutory obligations were set in place requiring pharmacists to join the association through membership at the prefectural and local municipality level, which began the process of establishing local pharmaceutical associations. The legal process undertaken by the Imperial government was similar to the establishment of the Japan Medical Association. The New Pharmaceutical Act of 1943 brought the Japan Pharmaceutical Association under the direct control of the Imperial government. The JPA national president and the controlling members of local pharmaceutical associations were appointed by the Minister for Health. Following the end of World War II, the JPA was amalgamated with the in 1948 and membership became voluntary. In 1949 the American Pharmaceutical Association visited Japan and recommendations for the reform of the medical pharmaceutical industry were implemented including changes to law and education of pharmacists. In 1962 the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan broke away from the JPA and was incorporated as a separate organisation. In 2011, an emergency team of 2062 pharmacists were deployed in response to the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, to ensure that essential medications were supplied to those displaced by the event, and maintain continuity of care. ==Membership types and employment== There are four membership types: *The supporting member class is open to individuals who are not practicing pharmacists, but who endorse and support the operations of the association. *The regular member class is open to pharmacists who endorse and support the operations of the association. *The special member class is open to individuals who are studying pharmacy, or have knowledge and experience related to pharmacy, and who endorse and support the operations of the association. *The honorary member class is open to individuals who have been elected by the board of directors, and who have made significant contributions to achieving the purposes of the association. Most JPA members are employed in community pharmacies or pharmacies attached to clinics and hospitals. The involvement of pharmacists in promoting safe self-medicating practices in an aging population, is anticipated as being an important change in pharmacy practice. This has led to the introduction of pharmacist professional development programs, to equip pharmacists by 2025, with the capacity to engage in a team based allied community health approach to pharmacist practice. ==Notable members== Satoshi \u014cmura 2015 Nobel laureate known for his contribution to the development of the drug Ivermectin a WHO listed essential medicine for the treatment of parasites.
