    "text": "BEM, cover, Avon Fantasy Reader, 1951 The bug-eyed monster is an early convention of the science fiction genre. Extraterrestrials in science fiction of the 1930s were often described (or pictured on covers of pulp magazines) as grotesque creatures with huge, oversized or compound eyes and a lust for women, blood or general destruction. In the contactee/abductee mythology, which grew up quickly beginning in 1952, the blond, blue-eyed, and friendly Nordic aliens of the 1950s were quickly replaced by small, unfriendly bug-eyed creatures, closely matching in many respects the pulp cover clich\u00e9s of the 1930s which have remained the abductor norm since the 1960s. ==Popular culture== * The Daleks from Doctor Who.
