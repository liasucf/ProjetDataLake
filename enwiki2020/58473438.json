    "text": "\"Slow Dancing in the Dark\" (stylized in all caps) is a song by Japanese singer-songwriter Joji. It is the second single from his debut album, Ballads 1. The song was written and produced by Joji and Patrick Wimberly. The song was chosen as BBC Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac's Hottest Record in the World for 18 September 2018. ==Music video== A music video for the song was released the same day. Directed by Jared Hogan, the video features Miller in a white tuxedo smoking a cigarette and stumbling through city streets at night in emotional anguish. Later in the video, he is revealed to be a satyr with an arrow in his back. He coughs up blood while splayed on an illuminated dance floor. He eventually collapses in a pool of blood. The final frame is used in the song's cover artwork. The video's visual style has been compared to that of director David Fincher. ==Remixes== An acoustic remix of \"Slow Dancing in the Dark\" was released as a single on 18 October 2018. It features Miller singing over a solo piano backing played by co-producer Carol Kuswanto. Remixes of the song by Mr. Mitch and Loud Luxury were released on 9 November 2018. ==Usage in media== The song's microwave-like 'ding' sound effect featured in its pre- chorus has spawned a TikTok challenge known as the \"Microwave Challenge\". ==Personnel== ;Original version Credits adapted from Tidal. * George Miller \u2013 songwriting, vocals, arrangement * Patrick Wimberly \u2013 production, recording, mixing, arrangement * Francisco \"Frankie\" Ramirez \u2013 recording * Chris Athens \u2013 mastering ;Acoustic Remix Credits adapted from Tidal. * George Miller \u2013 production, songwriting, arrangement * Patrick Wimberly \u2013 production, arrangement * Carol Kuswanto \u2013 production * Francisco \"Frankie\" Ramirez \u2013 mastering, mixing, recording ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (2018\u20132019) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Canada (Canadian Hot 100) | 52 |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ) | 4 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard Hot 100 | 69 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard) | 39 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) !scope=\"col\"| Position |- !scope=\"row\"| US Hot R&B; Songs (Billboard) | 5 |} ==Certifications== ==References== Category:2018 songs Category:2018 singles Category:Joji (musician) songs Category:Rhythm and blues ballads Category:Song recordings produced by Patrick Wimberly ",
