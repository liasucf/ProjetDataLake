    "text": "Redemptus of the Cross (also Redemptorus), (15 March 1598 \u2013 27 November 1638) was a Portuguese lay brother in the Order of Discalced Carmelites. He was put to death along with other members of a group sent to Aceh by Portuguese authorities. ==Life== He was born Tom\u00e1s Rodrigues da Cunha in Paredes de Coura, Portugal on 15 March 1598. He first served as a soldier in the Portuguese army in India, where he joined the Carmelites in Goa as a lay brother in 1615, taking the name Redemptus of the Cross. Redemptus was sent by the superiors of the Order to accompany Father Denis of the Nativity as part of an ambassadorial mission from the Portuguese Empire to the Sultan of Aceh. The mission was led by Dom Francisco Sousa de Castro as ambassador. Once in Aceh, all the members of the mission were seized and arrested, at the instigation of the Dutch authorities based in Jakarta. They were then subjected to torture, and those members of the mission who refused to deny their faith were executed one by one. The two friars were led to a desolate spot on the seashore, where Redemptus was shot with arrows, after which his throat was slit. Father Denis, a crucifix in his hands, was the last to die, his skull shattered by a blow of a scimitar. Castro, the ambassador, was the only survivor. He was held in captivity for three years, until his family paid a large ransom for his release.Route ==Veneration== Redemptus of the Cross was beatified on 10 June 1900 by Pope Leo XIII, together with Denis of the Nativity. Their feast day in the Calendar of Saints of the Order is the 29 November. ===Prayer=== ==References== ==External links== *Blessed Redemptorus of the Cross at SQPN Category:1598 births Category:1638 deaths Category:People from Viana do Castelo District Category:16th-century Portuguese people Category:17th-century Portuguese people Category:Portuguese soldiers Category:Discalced Carmelites Category:Portuguese Roman Catholic missionaries Category:Murdered missionaries Category:Carmelite beatified people Category:16th-century venerated Christians Category:17th-century venerated Christians Category:17th-century Roman Catholic martyrs Category:Portuguese beatified people Category:Portuguese Roman Catholic saints Category:Beatified Roman Catholic religious brothers Category:People murdered in Indonesia Category:Portuguese people murdered abroad Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in Indonesia Category:Portuguese torture victims Category:Christians executed for refusing to convert to Islam ",
