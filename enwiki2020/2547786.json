Used as a commercial and civil maritime ensign from the 1690s (allegedly from 1668) on. Since 1700, tricolor has been used as the flag of the Tsar of Moscow by Peter the Great. Also this flag was a national trade and it was raised on Russian merchant ships. It existed before the introduction in 1858 of a black-yellow-white tricolor. Since 1896, it again became the national flag of the Russian Empire. It was also used by the Russian state during the Civil War in Russia. |} ==Flags of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation== A majority of the flags of the Russian Armed Forces mimic the flag designs of the Imperial Russian Army and Navy, while some flags are directly based on Soviet era flags. Most notably, the flag of the Russian Airborne troops is based on the flag of the Soviet Airborne troops, and the flag of the Russian Aerospace forces is based on the Soviet Air Force flag. Many Russian military flags and regiment banners employ the Saint George's Cross within their design, which was heavily in use by the Imperial Russia Army up to the early 20th century. These military banners shared many similarities to the regiment banners of the Prussian Army, which in some cases looked almost identical to each other. Around 2006, many traditional Russian banners replaced Soviet era regiment banners in favor of moving away from Communist oriented iconography. ===Flags of service branches=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" ! width=\"100\"|Flag!!width=\"100\"|Date!!width=\"400\"|Use!!width=\"725\"|Description |- | || 2003\u2013present || Flag of the Ministry of Defence || |- | || 2004\u2013present || Flag of the Russian Ground Forces || |- | rowspan=\"2\" | || 1712\u20131917 || Ensign of the imperial Russian Navy || A dark blue saltire on a white field.

It signified the victory over Nazi Germany, and served as the main symbol of victory of the Soviet people. It was amended in Russian law in 1996, but with a new design to distance the new Russian state from any usage of Communist iconography. In 2007, following pressure from Red Army veterans, the original Victory Banner design replaced the 1996 variant, and has since then served its usage in virtually every single Victory Day parade held across Russia. | || 1996\u20132007 || 23x15px Symbol of Victory Banner || The Symbol of Victory Banner was an alternative to using the historic Victory Banner, which contained the hammer and sickle. |- | ||2007\u2013present || 23x15px 23x15px Banner of Victory || The Banner of Victory raised on the Reichstag in 1945.

The current flag of the Russian Federation revived the historical tri-color flag of the Tsardom of Russia after 288 years since its inception as the first civil flag of Russia. Its usage was discarded and even illegal after the Bolsheviks took control of Russia in 1917. However, during the Russian Civil War, the tri-color continued its usage by the Russian White Movement and White army until their defeat in 1923. The tri-color became a symbol of opposition, and a relic of tsarist rule, and thus it was punishable to wield the tri-color in public. During perestroika, the tri-color was no longer a punishable offense, and its usage was used by opposition parties and democratic movements prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union. |} ==Historical standards of Russia== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" ! width=\"100\"|Flag!!width=\"100\"|Date!!width=\"400\"|Use!!width=\"725\"|Description |- | || 1703-1917 || Imperial Standard at sea || The Standard of the Tsar of Russia at sea, adopted under the rule of Peter the Great. |- | || || Imperial Standard on land || In the album of flags of 1835, an Imperial Standard used at palaces was reported. |- | || 1858-1917|| Imperial Standard on land || Standard of the Tsar of Russia on land, adopted in 1858. |- | || 1991 || Presidential Standard (unofficial) || De facto unofficial Standard of the President of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, used during the inauguration of Boris Yeltsin on July 10, 1991. |- | || 1994\u2013present || Presidential Standard|| Current Presidential Standard of the Russian Federation. |} ==Flags of Russian cities== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" ! width=\"100\"|Flag!!width=\"100\"|Date!!width=\"400\"|Use!!width=\"725\"|Description |- | || 1997\u2013present || Flag of Astrakhan || |- | || 1995\u2013present || Flag of Barnaul || The arms of the city of Barnaul on a blue background. |- | || 2002\u2013present || Flag of Chelyabinsk || |- | || 2002\u2013present || Flag of Cherepovets || A blue pall on a golden background. |- | || 1996\u2013present || Flag of Irkutsk || |- | || 2003\u2013present || Flag of Ivanovo || |- | || 2000\u2013present || Flag of Izhevsk || |- | || 1996\u2013present || Flag of Kaliningrad || |- | || 2000\u2013present || Flag of Kaluga || |- | || 2004\u2013present || Flag of Kazan || |- | || 2010\u2013present || Flag of Kirov || |- | || 2006\u2013present || Flag of Krasnodar || |- | || 1995\u2013present || Flag of Krasnoyarsk || |- | || 2000\u2013present || Flag of Kursk || |-| || 1997\u2013present || Flag of Lipetsk || |-| || 1997\u2013present || Flag of Kurgan || | || 2004\u2013present || Flag of Magnitogorsk || A black triangle on a silver\u2010colored background. |- | || 1995\u2013present || Flag of Moscow || |- | || 2006\u2013present || Flag of Nizhny Novgorod || |- | || 2006\u2013present || Flag of Nizhny Tagil || |- | || || Flag of Norilsk || |- | || || Flag of Novokuznetsk || |- | || || Flag of Novosibirsk || |- | || || Flag of Omsk || |- | || || Flag of Orenburg || |- | || || Flag of Oryol || |- | || || Flag of Perm || |- | || || Flag of Petropavlovsk- Kamchatsky || |- | || || Flag of Petrozavodsk || |- | || || Flag of Pskov || |- | || || Flag of Rostov-on-Don || |- | || || Flag of Ryazan || |- | || 1992\u2013present || Flag of St Petersburg || |- | || || Flag of Samara || |- | || || Flag of Saratov || |- | || || Flag of Sergiyev Posad || |- | || || Flag of Stavropol || |- | || || Flag of Sochi || |- | || || Flag of Suzdal || |- | || || Flag of Tolyatti || |- | || || Flag of Tomsk || |- | || || Flag of Tula || |- | || || Flag of Tver || |- | || || Flag of Ufa || |- | || || Flag of Ulan- Ude || |- | || || Flag of Ulyanovsk || A vertical triband of blue, white, and blue, with a golden crown in the middle of the white stripe. |- | || || Flag of Veliky Novgorod || |- | || || Flag of Vladimir || |- | || || Flag of Vladivostok || |- | || 1999\u2013present || Flag of Volgograd || The arms of the city of Volgograd on a red background. |- | || || Flag of Vologda || |- | || || Flag of Voronezh || |- | || || Flag of Yakutsk || |- | || 1996\u2013present || Flag of Yaroslavl || The arms of the city of Yaroslavl on a blue background. |- | || || Flag of Yekaterinburg || |} ==Flag of the Far Eastern Republic== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" ! width=\"100\"|Flag!!width=\"100\"|Date!!width=\"400\"|Use!!width=\"725\"|Description |- | || 1920\u20131922 || Flag of the Far Eastern Republic || Flag of the short lived Far Eastern Republic, a puppet state of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic.
