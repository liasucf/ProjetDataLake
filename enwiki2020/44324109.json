In 2008 the station was allowed by the Swiss government to establish a correspondent at the Bundeshaus \u2013 the Bundeshaus Radio is airing for in all 13 private radio stations from the sessions of the Swiss parliament assembly in the capital city. Radio Z\u00fcrisee moved in 1994 from St\u00e4fa to Rapperswil at the location opposite of the Rapperswil railway station, from where it's still airing. In 2011 the Bernese radio Capital FM was bought from Tamedia. Theodor Gut junior, editor in chief of the Z\u00fcrichsee- Zeitung from 1953 to 1987, initiated the transition of his newspaper to a non- partisan forum newspaper, and the company expanded in 1983 to get involved in Radio Z\u00fcrisee. Radio Z\u00fcrisee is owned by the Z\u00fcrichsee Medien AG in St\u00e4fa, i.e. it is organized as an Aktiengesellschaft having a share capital of 1,500,000 Swiss Francs, of which 77% are held by the owner. In 2013 a turnover of 5,29 million Swiss Francs was resulted. == Broadcast and program == Broadcast in the Swiss cantons of Glarus, Schaffhausen, Schwyz, St. Gallen and Z\u00fcrich, the radio station has an audience of about 220,000 people aged between about 20 and 40 years.
