Since league rugby began they were long standing members of Yorkshire 2, managing to avoid either promotion or relegation for the first dozen or so years of the leagues. The arrival of former England and Halifax RLFC scrum half David Holmes spearheaded a new era and the club reached the final of the Tetley Bitter Vase at Twickenham in 2000, securing a 20\u201311 win over favourites Bank of England RUFC. Despite finishing second, a restructure of the leagues meant that they remained in Yorkshire 2; as all ten clubs below them were relegated! Promotion the following year was accompanied by the club's first Yorkshire Shield win over Scarborough and the 'Tigers' stayed in Yorkshire 1 for two seasons before a disastrous campaign in 2002\u201303 saw them relegated back to Yorkshire 2. The arrival of Coach Richard Selkirk and a host of new players saw Tigers promoted at the second time of asking in 2004\u201305 a year that also saw a second Vase win at Twickenham, this time over Solihull after a tumultuous semi-final win at Sidmouth. Further success followed in 2005\u201306 with the Yorkshire 1 title captured, and at their first attempt Tigers made it three promotions in a row in 2006\u201307 with a play-off win over North 2 West rivals Lymm to book their place in North 1 for 2007\u201308. Three seasons later the club gained promotion from this league, now known as National 3 North, via a play-off victory over Chester.Club website history page ==Honours== * Tetley/Powergen Junior Vase winners (2): 1999\u201300, 2004\u201305 * Yorkshire Shield winners: 2000\u201301 * South Yorkshire Trophy winners (3): 2003\u201304, 2004\u201305, 2005\u201306 * Yorkshire League 2 champions: 2004\u201305 * Yorkshire League 1 champions: 2005\u201306 * North 2 (east v west) promotion playoff winners: 2006\u201307 * National League 3 (north v midlands) promotion play-off winner: 2010\u201311 * National League 3 North champions: 2015\u201316 ==Current standings== ==References== ==External links== * Official site Category:English rugby union teams Category:Rugby clubs established in 1932 Tigers Category:Rugby union in Yorkshire ",
