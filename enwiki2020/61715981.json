He is the co-founder of the YouTube channel Temple Monkeys, one of the oldest Tamil-language YouTube channels, along with Vijay Varadharaj. ==Career== In 2017, Sha Ra made his feature film debut with Maanagaram before appearing in Meesaya Murukku later that same year. He later auditioned for a small supporting role in Iruttu Araiyil Murattu Kuththu, but was later given the role of Gautham Karthik's friend after the actor who was originally chosen for the role left the film due to date issues. Thinkal Menon of The Times of India wrote that \"Shah Ra\u2019s comic timing works to a good extent\". He played one of the leads in the comedy film Super Duper and portrayed two roles in the film. In a review of the film, Oh My Kadavule, a critic noted that Sha Ra is \"rather endearing\". ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \"width:100%;\" |+Key | style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"| | Denotes films that have not yet been released |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
