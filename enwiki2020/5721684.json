In 1949, he attempted to defect and was caught. He was charged with espionage and treason by the secret service and placed under house arrest. The charges were eventually dropped due to lack of evidence, but Grosics was banned from the national team for two years. However, after a year he returned to the national team. He also joined the Budapest Honv\u00e9d FC in 1950. In 1952, Grosics led the team to Olympic gold. In 1953, Hungary beat England in a game dubbed \"The Match of the Century\".
