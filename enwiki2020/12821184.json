At the time of her retirement, Kristin Bengtsson was the only other player in Swedish football history to have amassed 150 caps. She competed in the 1995, 1999, and 2003 Women's World Cups, netting three goals for Sweden overall. She also competed for Sweden in the 1996, 2000 and 2004 Olympics. Domestically, she played for Malm\u00f6 FF in the Damallsvenskan, and won the Diamantbollen as Sweden's top female footballer in 1995. ===Matches and goals scored at World Cup & Olympic tournaments=== Malin Andersson competed in three FIFA Women's World Cups: Sweden 1995, USA 1999, USA 2003; and three Olympic tournaments: the 1996 Atlanta Games, the 2000 Sydney Games, and the 2004 Athens Games. She appeared in all but two of her team's matches across those tournaments, and played every minute of the 1995 & 1999 World Cups, and the 2000 Olympics. In the 1995 World Cup, she scored both the first and the final goals for Sweden as they came back from an 0-2 deficit vs Germany to win 3-2 on the second day of match play. Her 53' goal against Brazil in the Quarter- Finals of the 2003 World Cup proved to be the winning goal in that match, a crucial victory in Sweden's march to a second place finish.https://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/news/brazil-sweden-17088 FIFA Women's World Cup 2003 BRAZIL 1 : 2 SWEDEN {| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"fontsize:90%;\" |- !
