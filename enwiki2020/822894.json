    "text": "Michael Clark Rockefeller (May 18, 1938 - presumed to have died November 19, 1961) was the fifth child of New York Governor and future U.S. Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, and a fourth-generation member of the Rockefeller family. He disappeared during an expedition in the Asmat region of southwestern Netherlands New Guinea, which is now a part of the Indonesian province of Papua. In 2014, Carl Hoffman published a book that went into detail about the inquest into his killing, in which villagers and tribal elders admit to Rockefeller being killed after he swam to shore in 1961. Despite these claims, no remains or other proof of his death have ever been discovered. ==Early life== Rockefeller was the fifth and last child of Mary Todhunter Rockefeller and Nelson Rockefeller. He was the third son of seven children fathered by Nelson Rockefeller, and he had a twin sister, Mary. After attending The Buckley School in New York, and graduating from the Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, where he was a student senator and exceptional varsity wrestler, Rockefeller graduated cum laude from Harvard University with a B.A. in history and economics. In 1960, he served for six months as a private in the U.S. Army and then went on an expedition for Harvard's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology to study the Dani tribe of western Netherlands New Guinea. The expedition filmed Dead Birds, an ethnographic documentary movie produced by Robert Gardner, and for which Rockefeller was the sound recordist. Rockefeller and a friend briefly left the expedition to study the Asmat tribe of southern Netherlands New Guinea. After returning home from the Peabody expedition, Rockefeller returned to New Guinea to study the Asmat and collect Asmat art. > \"It's the desire to do something adventurous,\" he explained, \"at a time when > frontiers, in the real sense of the word, are disappearing.\" He spent his time in Netherlands New Guinea actively engaged with the culture and the art while recording ethnographic data. In one of his letters home he wrote: > I am having a thoroughly exhausting but most exciting time here ... The > Asmat is like a huge puzzle with the variations in ceremony and art style > forming the pieces. My trips are enabling me to comprehend (if only in a > superficial, rudimentary manner) the nature of this puzzle ...Excerpt from a > letter from Michael Rockefeller, November 13, 1961 Gerbrands, A. A., Ed. > (1967). The Asmat of New Guinea: The Michael C. Rockefeller Expeditions > 1961. New York, NY: The New York Graphic Society ==Disappearance== On November 17, 1961, Rockefeller and Dutch anthropologist Ren\u00e9 Wassing were in a dugout canoe about from shore when their double pontoon boat was swamped and overturned.The Search for Michael Rockefeller Their two local guides swam for help, but it was slow in coming. After drifting for some time, early on November 19 Rockefeller said to Wassing \"I think I can make it\" and swam for shore. The boat was an estimated from the shore when he made the attempt to swim to safety, supporting the theory that he died from exposure, exhaustion, and/or drowning.The Michael C. Rockefeller Memorial Fellowship Wassing was rescued the next day, while Rockefeller was never seen again, despite an intensive and lengthy search effort. At the time, Rockefeller's disappearance was a major world news item. His body was never found. He was declared legally dead in 1964.1961 Life Magazine online retrieved March 26, 2010 ==Speculation== It is believed that Rockefeller either drowned or was attacked by a shark or saltwater crocodile. As headhunting and cannibalism were still present in some areas of Asmat in 1961, it has also been speculated that Rockefeller may have been killed and eaten by Asmat tribespeople.About the search for Michael Rockefeller, son of New York mayor Nelson Rockefeller, history of his mysterious disappearance. In 1969, the journalist Milt Machlin traveled to the island to investigate Rockefeller's disappearance. He dismissed reports of Rockefeller living as a captive or as a Kurtz-like figure in the jungle, but concluded that circumstantial evidence supported the idea that he had been killed.Lost Scion - Was Michael Rockefeller eaten by cannibals? Several leaders of Otsjanep village, where Rockefeller likely would have arrived had he made it to shore, had supposedly been killed by a Dutch patrol in 1958, thus providing some rationale for revenge by the tribe against someone from the \"white tribe\". Neither cannibalism nor headhunting in Asmat were indiscriminate, but rather were part of a tit-for-tat revenge cycle, so it is possible that Rockefeller found himself the inadvertent victim of such a cycle. The incident is described in \"Dance of the Warriors\", the second volume of the documentary series Ring of Fire by the Blair brothers. A book titled Rocky Goes West by author Paul Toohey claims that, in 1979, Rockefeller's mother hired a private investigator to go to New Guinea and try to resolve the mystery of his disappearance. The reliability of the story has been questioned, but Toohey claims that the private investigator swapped a boat engine for the skulls of the three men that a tribe claimed were the only white men they had ever killed. The investigator returned to New York and handed these skulls to the family, convinced that one of them was the skull of Rockefeller. If this event did actually occur, the family has never commented on it. However, the History Channel program Vanishings reported that Rockefeller's mother did pay a $250,000 reward to the investigator which was offered for final proof whether or not Michael Rockefeller was alive or dead.In 1961, 23-year-old Michael Rockefeller In the documentary film Keep the River on Your Right, Tobias Schneebaum states that he spoke with Asmat cannibals who described finding Rockefeller on the riverside and eating him.Keep the River on Your Right: A Modern Cannibal Tale (2000) ===2014 book on disappearance=== In 2014, Carl Hoffman published the book Savage Harvest: A Tale of Cannibals, Colonialism, and Michael Rockefeller's Tragic Quest for Primitive Art where he discusses researching Rockefeller's mysterious disappearance and presumed death. During multiple visits to the villages in the area, he heard several stories about men from Otsjanep killing Rockefeller after he swam to shore. The stories, which were similar to testimonials collected in the 1960s, center around a handful of men arguing and eventually deciding to kill Michael after he swam to shore, in revenge for a 1958 incident in which men from the village were killed in a confrontation with Dutch colonial officials. Soon after the murders, the villages were swept by a cholera epidemic and the villagers believed that it was retribution for killing Rockefeller. As Hoffman left one of the villages for the final time, he witnessed a man acting out a scene wherein someone was killed, and stopped to videotape it. When translated, the man was quoted as saying: > Don't you tell this story to any other man or any other village, because > this story is only for us. Don't speak. Don't speak and tell the story. I > hope you remember it and you must keep this for us. I hope. I hope. This is > for you and you only. Don't talk to anyone, forever; to other people or > another village. If people question you, don't answer. Don't talk to them, > because this story is only for you. If you tell it to them, you'll die. I am > afraid you will die. You'll be dead; your people will be dead, if you tell > this story. You keep this story in your house; to yourself, I hope, forever. > Forever. ... ==Asmat artifacts and photographs== Many of the Asmat artifacts Rockefeller collected are part of the Michael C. Rockefeller Wing collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The Peabody Museum has published the catalogue of an exhibition of pictures taken by Rockefeller during the New Guinea expedition. ==In popular culture== The 1973, National Lampoon Comics contained a story (titled \"New Guinea Pig\") that focused on Rockefeller's disappearance as being a ruse so he could kill all the black people in New Guinea and his family could steal their resources.National Lampoon Comics TPB (1973) Rockefeller's disappearance was the subject of episode #30 of In Search of ... which originally aired January 21, 1978. The band Guadalcanal Diary wrote a song about Rockefeller's disappearance called \"Michael Rockefeller\" which appeared on their 1986 album Jamboree. In the travel adventure book Ring of Fire: An Indonesian Odyssey the Blair brothers claim to have discussed Rockefeller's death with a tribesman who killed him. Christopher Stokes's short story \"The Man Who Ate Michael Rockefeller\", published in the 23rd issue of McSweeney's Quarterly Concern (Spring 2007), presents a fictional account of young Michael's demise.
