The album was released on March 21, 2007. The album features the band's previous four singles \"Aruiteru\" (which also appeared on the EP 7.5 Fuyu Fuyu Morning Musume Mini! in December 2006), \"Egao Yes Nude\", \"Sexy Boy: Soyokaze ni Yorisotte\" and \"Ambitious! Yashinteki de Ii Jan\". Also, as with Rainbow 7 and 7.5 Fuyu Fuyu..., tracks by four different sub-factions of the group are featured, including a solo track by Yoshizawa and the third pairing of Sayumi Michishige and Koharu Kusumi as their alter-egos \"Shige-pinku\" and \"Koha-pinku\" (first established on Rainbow 7's \"Rainbow Pink\"). The limited edition of the album includes a DVD; a bonus CD was also rumored for this edition but never materialized.
