Pedro Rold\u00e1n (1624\u20131699) was a Baroque sculptor from Seville, Andalusia, Spain. His daughter Luisa Rold\u00e1n, known as La Roldana, was also a major figure of Spanish Baroque sculpture. == Life == Christ of the Pardon, Church of Santa Mar\u00eda la Coronada, Medina Sidonia. Pedro Rold\u00e1n was born in Seville in 1624, where he was baptized in the Church of the Sanctuary () 14 January 1624, according to his certificate of baptism. It was believed for a time in the 20th century that he might have been born in Antequera (province of M\u00e1laga), because his family was from there and his older brother Marcos was born there, or alternatively that he could have been born in Orce (province of Granada), where his family lived for a time when Pedro was a childIn 1925, Gallego y Bur\u00edn published the certificate of Rold\u00e1n's marriage to Teresa de Jes\u00fas Ortega y Villavicencio, who were married in the Church of Saint Nicholas (Iglesia de San Nicol\u00e1s) in Granada 1 October 1642, receiving the sacrament the following 16 February. According to Gallego y Bur\u00edn, Rold\u00e1n was born in Antequera. In 1950, Heliodoro Sancho Corbacho published a marriage record initiated by descendants of Rold\u00e1n, in which the artist himself asserts that he was born in Orce (his final place of residence), where he lived with his parents. At the age of fourteen, he moved to Granada where he apprenticed to Alonso de Mena. In 1642 he contracted marriage to Teresa de Jes\u00fas Ortega y Villavicencio,Juan Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez, La escultura barroca en Espa\u00f1a, p. 169 who was probably the niece of his master Alonso de Mena. There, in 1644, they had their first daughter, named Mar\u00eda. In 1646, Alonso de Mena died, leaving Bernardo de Mora as the head of the studio; Rold\u00e1n left for Seville. at this time, Juan Mart\u00ednez Monta\u00f1\u00e9s was at the end of his career, presenting an opeining for Rold\u00e1n's work. In 1660 he began to teach classes in sculptural representation as a teacher at the Academy of Art founded by Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo. In his last years, he established a large studio where he collaborated with members of his family (his children and sons-in-law) and his students. The studio designed and constructed altarpieces, sculpted and polychromed, undertaking projects in places as far-flung as C\u00e1diz, Jerez de la Frontera, C\u00f3rdoba and Ja\u00e9n. He died in 1699, and was buried in the crypt of Saint Mark's Church (Iglesia de San Marcos) in Seville. Besides Murillo, he was also closely connected to Juan de Vald\u00e9s Leal. == Descendants == With his wife Teresa de Jes\u00fas Ortega y Villavicencio, Rold\u00e1n had eight children, all of whom worked closely with him in his studio. * Mar\u00eda Rold\u00e1n (born 1644), his oldest daughter, died young. * Teodora Manuela (1646) died young * Pedro Mauricio (1647) died young * Francisca Rold\u00e1n, (born 1650), was in charge of painting the faces and hands of the sculptures (giving them the natural colors of flesh),Rold\u00e1n, Luisa (La Roldana), www.artesacro.org.
