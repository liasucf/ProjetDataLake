    "text": "Von Hippel\u2013Lindau binding protein 1 (VBP1), also known as \"prefoldin 3\", is a chaperone protein that binds to von Hippel\u2013Lindau protein and transports it from perinuclear granules to the nucleus or cytoplasm inside the cell. It is also involved in transporting nascent polypeptides to cytosolic chaperonins for post-translational folding. VBP1 is a 197\u2013amino acid heterohexamer comprising two prefoldin-\u03b1 and four prefoldin-\u03b2 subunits, and is a member of the prefoldin-\u03b1 subunit family. It is ubiquitously expressed in tissues, and is located in the cell in the nucleus and cytoplasm. The VBP1 gene is located at Xq28. Homologues are known to exist between human VBP1 and proteins in mice, Drosophila and C. elegans. ==See also== *Von Hippel\u2013Lindau tumor suppressor *Von Hippel\u2013Lindau disease *Eugen von Hippel *Arvid Lindau ==References== ==External links== * Category:Proteins ",
