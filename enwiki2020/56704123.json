This Souk in particular kept getting bigger gradually until it extended to the path of the Great Mosque of Sfax. Some of the fishermen used to sleep over in the Souk in cabins and tents; that is why it stayed in the same primitive form until 1952 and 1953, when the current souk was built instead of Souk El Tebn. == Architecture == It has one main door that contains three openings and multiple side doors. == References == El Hout ",
