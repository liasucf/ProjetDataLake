Owner and operator of the plant is the state enterprise Rosenergoatom. Kalinin Nuclear Power Station supplies the majority of electricity in the Tver region and additionally serves Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Vladimir. In 2005 the nuclear power station fed into the grid. The station's four tall cooling towers are local landmarks. They were manufactured in 96 concrete sections each. By March 2009 the containment structure of the new Kalinin Unit 4 reactor was nearly complete.Second layer of the reactor containment of the 4th unit of Kalinin NPP mounted, 13 March 2009, access date: 3 May 2009 The reactor achieved its first criticality on 8 November 2011. == Reactor data == No.2 generating unit's turbine room The Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant has four units: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
