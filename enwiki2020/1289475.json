    "text": "Shaun Patrick Micallef (born 18 July 1962) is an Australian comedian, actor, writer and television presenter living in Melbourne, Australia. He is currently the host of the satirical news comedy series Shaun Micallef's Mad as Hell on the ABC and the game show Talkin' 'Bout Your Generation on Channel Nine. Micallef first gained recognition as a cast member of the sketch comedy show Full Frontal, which led to his own sketch show, The Micallef P(r)ogram(me), the sitcom Welcher & Welcher and the variety show Micallef Tonight. He then hosted the satirical news comedy series Newstopia on SBS, the game show Talkin' 'Bout Your Generation on Network Ten, and Shaun Micallef's Mad as Hell on ABC TV. He also co-created and starred in Mr & Mrs Murder on Network Ten. In addition to his television work Micallef has appeared on stage, most notably in the Australian production of Boeing Boeing and on radio as the co-host of Melbourne station Vega 91.5's morning program. He is also the author of the books: Smithereens (2004), Preincarnate (2010), The President's Desk (2014), Tales from a Tall Forest (2017) and The Uncollected Plays of Shaun Micallef (2018). ==Early life and education== Micallef was born in Adelaide, South Australia, and is of Maltese and Irish descent. His father worked for a company that sold parts for Volvos and his mother was employed at the Adelaide Bank. As a child, Micallef lived in Clovelly Park and attended St Bernadette's School in St Marys then St Joseph's Catholic School in Mitchell Park (now Sacred Heart College Middle School) before moving on to Sacred Heart Senior College where he was the College Captain. Micallef studied law at the University of Adelaide, where he was frequently involved in comedy revues, often involving Francis Greenslade and Gary McCaffrie, with whom he continues to work. ==Influences== Micallef was influenced by the Goons, Peter Sellers, Marx Brothers, S. J. Perelman, James Thurber, Spike Milligan, Barry Humphries, Frank Muir, Monty Python and Woody Allen. ==Career== ===Early theatre=== In 1972, having three younger sisters taking ballet classes, ten-year-old Micallef was often asked to help out when a dance routine required a boy. The following year he auditioned for the Bunyip Children's Theatre and over the next four years participated in plays that they performed in the Scott Theatre during school holidays. In 1976 he doubled for Humphrey B. Bear for personal appearances. ===Legal career=== Micallef was a practising solicitor for ten years in the field of insurance law before making the decision to move to Melbourne and pursue a full-time career in comedy in 1993. He relates the story that, while working as a solicitor, he talked so much about making a career change and becoming a comedian that his wife Leandra gave him an ultimatum: she marked a date on a calendar and told him to quit his job and become a comedian by that date or never talk about it again. ===Television and film=== Following early TV appearances on Theatre Sports (1987) and The Big Gig (1989), in early 1993 Micallef was offered a job writing for the Jimeoin show which was soon followed by an offer to also write for the sketch comedy show Full Frontal where six months later he took on the role as co-producer with Gary McCaffrie. In 1994, Micallef became a full-time cast member of Full Frontal, where he became well known for characters such as Milo Kerrigan, Nobby Doldrums and a send-up of Italian male model Fabio. Micallef recalls that the show was a good introduction to television comedy because, with an ensemble cast, its success did not hinge on his performance and he had more freedom to make and learn from mistakes. However, he was frustrated with the lack of control he had over his work in the series as well as the repetition of characters and gags. Micallef's role on Full Frontal led to a 1996 special Shaun Micallef's World Around Him and three seasons of the two-time Logie Award-winning ABC series The Micallef Program (1998\u20132001), which he co-wrote and produced with long-time writing partner Gary McCaffrie. Since the series' end he has created and starred in two short-lived television series, the sitcom Welcher & (2003) and the variety show Micallef Tonight (2003), and devised a series of telemovies, BlackJack (2003\u2013present). Micallef has also had acting roles in the television series SeaChange (2000), Through My Eyes (2004) and Offspring (2010) as well as supporting roles in the films Bad Eggs (2003), The Honourable Wally Norman (2003), The Extra (2005), Aquamarine (2006) and The King (2007). In 2006, he was a recurring guest on the Network Ten Improvisational theatre show Thank God You're Here. In 2007, along with partners McCaffrie and Michael Ward, Micallef developed the satirical comedy program Newstopia, which he hosted. In 2009, Micallef joined the Ten Network and hosted Talkin' 'Bout Your Generation, which aired for four seasons. He co- created Mr & Mrs Murder, a crime comedy television series for Channel Ten which aired in 2013, and starred in the lead role of Charlie Buchanan alongside Kat Stewart. Also that year, Micallef signed on to voice the artificially intelligent robot REEF in the Australian feature length science fiction film Arrowhead (2014). Micallef currently hosts Shaun Micallef's Mad as Hell (2012\u2013present)Shaun Micallef's Mad As Hell \u2013 Australian Broadcasting Corporation \u2013 Retrieved 1 June 2012. and Talkin' Bout Your Generation which was renewed in 2017 for Channel Nine. ===Other work=== In September 2005, Micallef began hosting the breakfast show \"Shaun, Beverley and Denise\" on Melbourne radio station Vega 91.5 FM with comedian Denise Scott and television presenter Beverley O'Connor. In July 2006, comedian Dave O'Neil took over as host and the show was renamed \"Dave and Denise with Shaun Micallef\". Micallef left the network on 23 November 2007. Micallef released a book, Smithereens, which was published in 2004 and contains a collection of prose, poetry and plays. He describes it as a collection of \"all sorts of bits and pieces I have written\". His second book, a novella titled Preincarnate, was released in 2010. In October 2014, Micallef released his third book, The President's Desk: An Alt-History of the United States; a semi-fictitious history, told from the perspective of the Resolute desk. ==Personal life== Micallef currently lives in Williamstown, Victoria, with his wife Leandra, whom he married in 1988, and their three sons. ==List of works== ===Films=== * Bad Eggs (2003) \u2013 Premier Cray * The Honourable Wally Norman (2003) \u2013 Ken Oats * The 13th House (2003) \u2013 Sir * The Extra (2005) \u2013 Paul Ridley * Aquamarine (2006) \u2013 Storm Banks * The King (2007) \u2013 Colin Bednall * The Cup (2011) \u2013 Lee Freedman * Arrowhead (2014) \u2013 RE3F (voice) ===Television=== *The Big Gig (1989) (writer) *Jimeoin (1994) \u2013 various (also writer) *Full Frontal (1994\u20131997) \u2013 various (also writer and producer) *The Glynn Nicholas Show (1996) (writer) *Shaun Micallef's World Around Him (1996) \u2013 various (also writer and producer) *The Micallef Program (1998\u20132001) \u2013 various (also writer and producer) *SeaChange (2000) \u2013 Warwick Munro *Welcher & Welcher (2003) \u2013 Quentin Welcher (also writer and producer) *Micallef Tonight (2003) \u2013 himself (also writer) *BlackJack (2003\u20132007) (writer) *Through My Eyes (2005) \u2013 Jack Winneke *Thank God You're Here (2006\u20132007) \u2013 various (semi-regular guest) *Dogstar (2007) \u2013 narrator *Newstopia (2007\u20132008) \u2013 himself *Talkin' 'Bout Your Generation (2009\u20132012, 2018\u20132019) \u2013 host *Melbourne International Comedy Festival (2009) \u2013 host *Offspring (2010) \u2013 Lachlan *Laid (2011\u20132012) \u2013 G-Bomb *The Bazura Project's Guide To Sinema (2011) \u2013 MK-Ultra (voice) *Mollusks (2011) \u2013 Easty (voice) *Shaun Micallef's Mad as Hell (2012\u2013present) \u2013 host *Mr & Mrs Murder (2013) \u2013 Charlie Buchanan *Danger 5 (2012, 2014) - Principal *Shaun Micallef's Stairway to Heaven (2014) - himself *The Ex-PM (2015) - Andrew Dugdale ===Theatre=== *Boeing Boeing (2008) \u2013 Bernard *Good Evening - Sketches from Dudley Moore and Peter Cook (2010) *The Odd Couple (2016) ===Radio shows=== *Dave and Denise with Shaun Micallef on Vega 91.5 FM (2005\u20132007) *The Comedy Crystal Set \u2013 Adelaide University Radio, Co-host ===Books=== *Smithereens (2004) *Preincarnate (2010) *The President's Desk (2014) *Tales from a Tall Forest (2017) *The Uncollected Plays of Shaun Micallef (2018) *Mad as Hell and Back: Silver Jubilee of Sketches, co-written with Gary McCaffrie (2019) ===Audio=== * The Expurgated Micallef Tonight: The Very Best of Shaun Micallef's Short- Lived but Brilliant Tonight Show (2008) * His Generation (2009) ==Awards== *2012: GQ Men of the Year Awards (Comedian of the Year) *2008: Aria Award (Best Comedy Release) \u2013 The Expurgated Micallef Tonight: The Very Best of Shaun Micallef's Short-Lived but Brilliant Tonight Show *2010: Logie Awards: Most Popular Presenter (Won); Gold Logie (nominated) for Talkin' 'Bout Your Generation ==References== ==External links== *Unofficial Shaun Micallef fansite *Original unofficial Shaun Micallef fansite (archived) * Category:1962 births Category:ARIA Award winners Category:Australian male comedians Category:Australian male film actors Category:Australian people of Irish descent Category:Australian people of Maltese descent Category:Australian solicitors Category:Australian television presenters Category:Comedians from Melbourne Category:Lawyers from Adelaide Category:Living people Category:Logie Award winners Category:People from Williamstown, Victoria Category:Talkin' 'Bout Your Generation Category:Adelaide Law School alumni ",
