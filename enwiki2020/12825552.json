    "text": "Intercity Football League () was the top-ranked division in the Taiwanese football (soccer) league run by Chinese Taipei Football Association (CTFA), run from 2007 until 2016.http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/sport/archives/2013/03/21/2003557602 From 2017, it was replaced by the Taiwan Football Premier League. ==History== The Intercity Football League was founded in 2007 after the transformation of then highest-ranked National First Division Football League (later Enterprise Football League). Different from the later, registered players were initially grouped by their places of residence, such as Tainan City, rather than specialized football teams, such as Taiwan Power Company (Taipower). The only exception was Tatung FC, who represented Taipei City to compete in the league. By Intercity Football League's establishment, CTFA hoped to root football into each area in Taiwan and also seed supports from local governments, councilors, and enterprises. In the first league season, several magistrates served as team leaders, including Chou Hsi-wei (Taipei County), Chen Ming-wen (Chiayi County), and Lu Kuo-hua (Yilan County). Nevertheless, in 2008, CTFA opened the league participation to non-administrative division teams. Taipower and several college teams, such as National Taiwan College of Physical Education (as Taichung County Chia Cheng Hsin) and Taipei Physical Education College (as Tainan County Hun Shin), joined the competition. CTFA announced new league regulations again in 2009. Each participating team should have name relating to one administrative region and more than 2/3 players having their households registered to that place for more than one month. Promotion and relegation were also introduced. However, the new regulations did not continue to the next league season. The 2010 league season adopted similar regulations as the 2008 season. In August 2010, MediaTek were announced as the title sponsor of the Intercity Football League until 2013. ==Intercity Football League 2015\u201316== * Air Source Development * Kaohsiung County Taipower * Ming Chuan University * National Sports Training Center * NTUPES * Royal Blues * Taichung City Dragon * Taipei City Tatung ===Relegated in 2010=== * Ming Chuan University * I-Shou University * Yilan County ==Champions== The list of champions: {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%; text-align: center;\" !width=10%|Season !width=20%|Champion !width=20%|Runner-up !width=20%|Third place !width=20%|Fourth place |- |2007 |Taipei City Tatung |Taipei PE College (as Tainan County) |Yilan County |Chiayi County |- |2008 |Kaohsiung County Taipower |Taiwan PE College (as Chia Cheng Hsin) |Taipei PE College (as Tainan County Hun Sing) |Taipei City Tatung |- |2009 |Taiwan PE College (as Kaohsiung City Yoedy) |Kaohsiung County Taipower |Taipei Physical Education College (as Tainan County) |Taipei City Tatung |- |2010 |Kaohsiung County Taipower |Taipei Physical Education College (as Asics) |Taipei City Tatung |National Sports Training Center |- |2011 |Kaohsiung County Taipower |Taipei City Tatung |Taiwan PE College |Taipei PE College |- |2012 |Kaohsiung County Taipower |Taipei City Tatung |National Sports Training Center |Taiwan PE College |- |2013 |Taipei City Tatung |Kaohsiung County Taipower |Taichung City Dragon |Ming Chuan University |- |2014 |Kaohsiung County Taipower |National Sports Training Center |Taichung City Dragon |Taipei City Tatung |- |2015\u201316 |Kaohsiung County Taipower |Taipei City Tatung |Taiwan PE College |National Sports Training Center |} ==See also== *Enterprise Football League *Chinese Taipei Football Association ==References== ==External links== *CTFA news *League at fifa.com *League at soccerway.com 1 Category:Sports leagues established in 2007 Category:2007 establishments in Taiwan Taiwan ",
