Pozo's primary position was third base, and he occasionally played second base. ==Career== Pozo was signed as an undrafted amateur free agent by the Seattle Mariners in August 1990. He spent three years in the Mariners' minor league system, advancing from the Class A Short- Season Bellingham Mariners to the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers. Pozo made his major league debut on September 12, 1995, with Seattle, hitting a pop out in one at bat; it was his only MLB appearance with the Mariners. After starting the 1996 season with the Tacoma Rainiers, Pozo was traded to the Boston Red Sox for Jeff Manto in July. Pozo spent the next two seasons splitting time between Boston and the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox. In his third game with the Red Sox, on July 28, 1996, he hit a grand slam off of Minnesota Twins relief pitcher Eddie Guardado. In 26 MLB career games, Pozo batted 14-for-74 (.189) with one home run and 14 RBIs.
