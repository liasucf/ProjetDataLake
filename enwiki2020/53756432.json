    "text": "The Field Newspaper Syndicate was a syndication service based in Chicago that operated independently from 1941 to 1984, for a good time under the name the Chicago Sun-Times Syndicate. The service was founded by Marshall Field III and was part of Field Enterprises. The syndicate was most well known for Steve Canyon, but also launched such popular, long-running strips as The Berrys, From 9 To 5, Rivets, and Rick O'Shay. Other features included the editorial cartoons of Bill Mauldin and Jacob Burck, and the \"Ask Ann Landers\" advice column. == History == The Chicago Sun Syndicate was founded in December 1941, concurrent with the founding of Marshall Field III's Chicago Sun newspaper. Long-time syndication veteran Henry Baker was installed as manager.\"Who's Who Among Leading U.S. Syndicate Executives,\" Editor & Publisher (September 7, 1946). Archived at \"News of Yore 1946: Syndicate Executives Profiled,\" Stripper's Guide (July 21, 2010). Comic-strip historian Allan Holtz has written regarding the origins of the Field Syndicate and its relationship to the rest of the company: Field formed Field Enterprises in August 1944,\"Owns The Chicago Sun: Field Enterprises, Inc., Organized By Marshall Field\", 'The New York Times, 1 September 1944, page 22. and the syndicate became known as Field Enterprises Syndicate'. One of the first major strips syndicated by Field was the hugely popular Mutt and Jeff (first launched in 1907), which moved over from the Bell Syndicate-North American Newspaper Alliance. With the Chicago Sun and Chicago Daily Times merger in January 1948, the syndicate absorbed the Chicago Times Syndicate,\"Who\u2019s Who Among Leading U.S. Syndicate Executives,\" Editor & Publisher (September 7, 1946), archived at \"News of Yore 1946: Syndicate Executives Profiled,\" Stripper's Guide (July 21, 2010). and installed its general manager, Russ Stewart, as head of Field Enterprises.Harvey, R.C. \"Milton Caniff, Steve Canyon and the Fair Sex,\" The Comics Journal (JUL 19, 2012). At some point circa 1950, the Field Syndicate changed its name to the Chicago Sun-Times Syndicate. In 1963 Field Enterprises and New York Herald Tribune publisher John Hay Whitney acquired the Chicago- based Publishers Newspaper Syndicate,Stetson, Damon. \"Herald Tribune Is Closing Its News Service: But Meyer Says Columns That Appeared in Paper Will Be in Merged Publication,\" New York Times (June 24, 1966). merging syndication operations with the Chicago Sun-Times Syndicate, the New York Herald Tribune Syndicate, and the syndicate of the Chicago Daily NewsToni Mendez Collection (a newspaper that had been acquired by Field Enterprises in 1959). In 1967, Field Enterprises acquired Robert M. Hall's Hall Syndicate, merging it with Publishers to form the Publishers-Hall Syndicate, and thus taking on distribution of such popular, long-running strips as Mary Worth, Steve Roper, Penny, Kerry Drake, Rex Morgan, M.D., Judge Parker, Miss Peach, B.C., and The Wizard of Id. In 1975, syndication operations absorbed Publishers-Hall, and were renamed the Field Newspaper Syndicate,Riley, Sam G.Biographical Dictionary of American Newspaper Columnists (Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995), p. 191. taking on such strips as Dennis the Menace, Funky Winkerbean, Mark Trail, and Momma. The operation was renamed News America Syndicate (NAS) in 1984, after the company was purchased by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.Friendly, Jonathan. \"Murdoch Buys Chicago Sun-Times,\" The New York Times, 2 November 1983, page D1. Richard S. Newcombe (coming over from the Los Angeles Times Syndicate) was named President of NAS, which at that point was considered the third-most powerful syndicate, after King Features and United Media.Storch, Charles. \"Hearst To Buy Murdoch Syndicate,\" Chicago Tribune (December 25, 1986). Hearst bought the syndicate in 1987 and renamed it North America Syndicate. The pending sale of NAS (which was first reported in October 1986), prompted Newcombe to leave the company in January 1987 and, using financial backing from London-based publisher Robert Maxwell, form Creators Syndicate before the close of the NAS sale. Creators Syndicate originated on February 13, 1987. Within a month, Creators acquired the syndication rights to B.C. and Ask Ann Landers.
