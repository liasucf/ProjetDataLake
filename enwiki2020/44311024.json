She is co-founder of the international movement Faith and Light; with Jean Vanier, she has dedicated her life\u2019s work to people with disabilities and to their families and friends. Through her testimonies, Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Mathieu continues to be involved in the lives of these support structures that she has created, in order to ensure that the person with a disability, irrespective of the severity, finds their unique, rightful place in society. == Biography == Mathieu was born in Tournus, Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire. In the 1950s, Mathieu began studying to become an (special needs teacher) under Father Henri Bissonnier. He was one of the few priests to consider the question of religious education for young people suffering from a mental disability, and went so far as to develop a new catechism for them. At the end of her course, Father Henri asked her to work with him, a collaboration that would last for around twenty years. In 1956, Mathieu was elected President of the French Christian Association of special needs teachers, for whom she founded the magazine (\"Special Needs Teachers\"). In 1957, during a retreat at Chateauneuf de Galaure (in the Dr\u00f4me region of France), where Father Finet was preaching, she met Marthe Robin, founder of the Foyers de Charit\u00e9. Robin, who was paralysed and practically blind, was very close to children with disabilities and their families. She would become an advisor and friend to Mathieu, and her support was invaluable in the birth of the (OCH, \"Christian Foundation for Disabled People\"). In 1963 Mathieu founded the OCH. The association aims to support families, encourage a response to their distress and offer them new hope, particularly through the introduction of a permanent place of welcome and financial support for Christian associations and establishments. In 1968, alongside the lectures and meetings, Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Mathieu created Ombres et Lumi\u00e8re (Shadows and Light), the OCH magazine aimed at people with disabilities, their families and friends. That same year, faced with the suffering of the parents of two children with serious disabilities who had felt marginalised at Lourdes, she launched a remarkable pilgrimage to Lourdes with Jean Vanier for people with mental disabilities and their families and friends. At Easter 1971, this pilgrimage gathered together 12,000 people from 15 countries, including 400 people with a mental disability. From this extraordinary gathering the international movement of Faith and Light was born, a movement which today numbers more than 1,508 communities in 80 countries. In addition to OCH and Faith and Light, Mathieu was involved in creating the Simon de Cyr\u00e8ne Foundation for people who have suffered a severe head injury. She is also one of the founders of Relais Lumi\u00e8re Esp\u00e9rance, which is aimed at close friends and relatives of people suffering from mental illness, as well as the Groupe de liaison Saint Joseph, which twice a year brings together around twenty organisations working to found and support Christian homes for adults with mental disabilities. In the same spirit, the Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Jamet working and communion group, which she launched with Xavier Le Pichon , enables around thirty small communities to meet, and supports them in their care for people suffering from psychological distress. Mathieu was appointed by Pope John-Paul II to the Pontifical Council for the Laity (1984 - 1989) and as expert for the Holy See at the Council of Europe. She is the first woman to have given a Lent address at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris (in 1988). Pope Benedict XVI appointed her auditor to the synod on the Eucharist (2005). ==Quote== == Positions == === Founder === *1963: Founded the Christian foundation for disabled people, of which she was Director until 1996. *1968: Founded the magazine Ombres et Lumi\u00e8re in 1968, a Christian magazine for people with disabilities, their families and friends.
