Broadcasting on 92.7 FM, XHXE carries the La Mejor national grupera music format from MVS Radio. ==History== XEXE-AM 1490 came to air in 1966, known as \"Radio Hits\" and affiliated to the then-new Grupo ACIR. Two years earlier, in November 1964, the concession had been awarded to Mar\u00eda Gloria Leticia \u00c1vila y Vizcarra. The station, operated by Carlos Caballero, was the fourth in the city and carried a wide-ranging music format, plus one of Quer\u00e9taro's earliest radio newscasts. After a brief stint as Radio Capital from 1978\u201380, ACIR returned to XEXE in 1980. The station took on the name of \"XEXE Radio ACIR 1490\" and began broadcasting 24 hours a day. XEXE broke from Grupo ACIR in 1989, moved its studio and transmitter to new facilities, and became known as \"Radio Hit 1490 AM\". The station pioneered live broadcasts of lucha libre from the Arena Quer\u00e9taro. In 1994, the station increased its power to 2.5 kW, and on February 25, 1995, the station moved down the dial to 1090 AM and picked up a grupera format. In 1997, the station was leased again and became Radio F\u00f3rmula's outlet in Quer\u00e9taro. In May 2011, the FM station launched. On October 1, 2012, the station broke from Radio F\u00f3rmula and became known as Integra 92siete. On October 1, 2016, it became Kiss FM as part of a marketing agreement with Multimundo, which took over operations from Integra, the group run by the Caballero \u00c1vila family. Kiss FM flipped to grupera as La Mejor on September 1, 2020. ==References== ==External links== *Multimundo Website Category:Spanish- language radio stations Category:Radio stations in Quer\u00e9taro ",
