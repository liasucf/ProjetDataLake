(Longden was part of that parish until it became an ecclesiastical parish in its own right in 1935; in 1955 Longden benefice amalgamated with neighbouring Annscroft.) The nave, of mixed red and yellow sandstone rubble, has a moulded plinth believed to be of mediaeval origin, and a blocked south doorway probably early 17th century. A polygonal apse chancel was added in the 18th century, which was restored 1877 and given north and south windows in 1938, while the west porch and vestry were added in 1852-53. It contains a late 17th-century plain wooden pulpit and a marble baluster shaped font, originally made for Pontesbury parish church in 1829, brought here in 1864. The oak lych-gate of the churchyard is the village's war memorial, erected after World War I. The churchyard contains the war graves of two British Army soldiers of World War II.
