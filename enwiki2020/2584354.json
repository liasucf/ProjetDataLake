It lies approximately south-west of K\u0142odzko, and south-west of the regional capital Wroc\u0142aw. As at 2019, the town has a population of 6,324. ==History== Historic town center of Polanica-Zdr\u00f3j Polanica-Zdr\u00f3j was first documented in 1347 under the name Heyde, when it was part of the Kingdom of Bohemia. At the time it belonged to the House of Glaubitz, and in the following centuries it often changed owners. From the end of the 16th century the village was co-owned by the Jesuits, who contributed to its development. In 1645 it was destroyed by Swedish troops during the Thirty Years' War. In 1742 the settlement \u2013 like all the area \u2013 was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia. The settlement grew quickly during the 19th century, becoming a popular health resort in the 1870s, after Prussia had become a component state of Germany in 1871. In 1890 a rail connection to Glatz (K\u0142odzko) was completed. Until 1933, that is the year the Nazis came to power in Germany, a Polish guesthouse existed in the town. During both world wars the sanatoria were turned into military hospitals. The town became part of Poland after World War II under the terms of the Potsdam Agreement. It was granted town rights in 1945 and its first mayor was Kazimierz D\u0105browski. On 28 June 1972 the Catholic parishes of Polanica-Zdr\u00f3j were redeployed from the traditional Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 diocese (est. 1664; Ecclesiastical Province of Bohemia) into the Archdiocese of Wroc\u0142aw.Paulus VI, Constitutio Apostolica father/paul vi/apost constitutions/documents/hf p-vi apc 19720628 vratislaviensis lt.html \"Vratislaviensis \u2013 Berolinensis et aliarum\", in: Acta Apostolicae Sedis, 64 (1972), n. 10, pp. 657seq.
