    "text": "Theydon Bois is a London Underground station in the village of Theydon Bois in Essex, England. It is served by the Central line and is between Debden and Epping. For the purposes of fare charging it is in Zone 6. ==History== The station was opened as \"Theydon\" by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) on 24 April 1865 but in December that year it was renamed to its present name. It opened as an intermediate station on their Loughton\u2013Ongar extension; the GER became part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923. 'Milk trains' to Liverpool Street were a regular feature in the timetable until the underpass from Leyton to Stratford was built. As part of the New Works Programme, 1935\u20131940, the LNER branch was transferred to London Underground, to form the part of the eastern extension of the Central line. In 2015, advocacy by a local group forced a proposed 80-space commuter car park to seek planning permission before being constructed on land adjacent to the station. Blow to TfL in row over commuter car park, Joseph Flaig, 6 August 2015. ==The station today== The station was one of the first on the Underground network to operate without a staffed ticket office. ==Gallery== Image:Theydon Bois stn north.JPG|Westbound platform looking north (eastbound) towards Epping Image:Theydon Bois stn south.JPG|Eastbound platform looking south (westbound) towards central London Image:Theydon Bois stn high northbound public footbridge.JPG|Looking north from public footbridge Image:Theydon Bois stn roundel.JPG|Station platform roundel ==References== ==External links== * Home-Transport for London Category:Central line stations Category:Proposed Chelsea-Hackney Line stations Category:Tube stations in Essex Category:Transport in Epping Forest District Category:Former Great Eastern Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1865 ",
