    "text": "Chabrier in 1882 The French composer Emmanuel Chabrier (1841\u20131894) wrote music in many genres, including opera and operetta, piano, orchestral music, and songs with piano accompaniment.Chabrier (Emmanuel). In: Larousse Dictionnaire de la Musique. \u00c9dition 2005, p. 193. The songs cover most of his creative years, from the early 1860s to 1890, when the illness which would kill him prevented much composition. He came late to music as a profession, but \u2013 although being an exceptional pianist \u2013 he had no trappings of a formal training: no conservatoire studies, no Prix de Rome, \"none of the conventional badges of French academic musicians, by whom he was regarded as an amateur\" (in the best sense).Crichton, Ronald. Chabrier \u2013 high spirits and a soft heart. Opera, September 1991, p. 1028-1033. There are forty-three published songs by Chabrier. He began composing these m\u00e9lodies when he was about twenty- one; the first nine were written between 1862 and 1866. Chabrier never set any verse by his friend Verlaine (although they did collaborate on two op\u00e9ras- bouffes Fisch-Ton-Kan and Vaucochard et fils Ier), but among the better-known poets whose verse Chabrier did set in these early songs were Th\u00e9odore de Banville (\"Lied\") and Alfred de Musset (\"Adieux \u00e0 Suzon\").Johnson, Graham. Musique adorable! The songs of Emmanuel Chabrier. (The Hyperion French Song Edition). Booklet accompanying Hyperion CDs CDA67133/4, 2001. Chabrier gave up his job at the Ministry of the Interior in 1880; as a full-time composer he set texts by Victor Hugo, Charles Baudelaire, Catulle Mend\u00e8s, Edmond Rostand and his wife Rosemonde G\u00e9rard, as well as lesser-known poets, and these songs were often intended for notable singers, such as Lucien Fug\u00e8re, \u00c9mile Engel, Jeanne Granier, Ernest Van Dyck and Paul Lh\u00e9rie.Delage, Roger. Emmanuel Chabrier. Fayard, Paris, 1999. Catalogue des oeuvres, pp. 685\u2013715. In a 1891 letter to Madame Colonne, wife of the famous conductor, Chabrier wrote \"I'm not a natural writer of romances, which is unfortunate, because the song, agreeably warbled in salons is, at the present time, the only way for a French composer to more or less pay the rent.\" None of his songs were a commercial success. ==Introduction== While not on the level of his contemporaries Faur\u00e9 and Duparc, some of Chabrier's songs are \"unique in the nineteenth century for their wit and satirical humour\". Examples such as the \"Villanelle des petits canards\", the \"Ballade des gros dindons\", and the \"Pastorale des cochons roses\" (from the Six m\u00e9lodies of 1890) \"anticipated by some years the twentieth-century reaction against Romantic song\".David Tunley: The New Oxford History of Music. Romanticism 1830-1890, vol IX, IX Solo song (b) France, p. 703. Ravel claimed that \"it is impossible to hear two of his chords without attributing them at once to him, and to him alone\". French composer Henri Barraud asserted that he was \"the most gifted inventor of unimagined harmonies, of rare combinations of timbres, the most vigorous colourist and the most straightforward melodist\".Bernac, 1970, p. 81. Enoch, his publisher, tried to get Chabrier to simplify what they judged to be complex piano parts which would discourage amateurs (and thus reduce sales); despite objections from the composer an edition with easy accompaniments was issued by them.Delage, Roger: \"Chabrier M\u00e9lodiste\", in: Emmanuel Chabrier: Ostinato rigore \u2013 Revue internationale d'\u00e9tudes musicales, No. 3, 1994 (Paris: Jean-Michel Place/Centre national du livre), p. 68. All are strophic songs, but the rhythm is usually cleverly modified in each stanza to suit the prosody of the literary text. They require, together with perfect precision, a supple, elegant style of interpretation, slightly whimsical; as remarked by Poulenc, a \"laisser-aller contr\u00f4l\u00e9\".Bernac, 1970, p. 81. The singer Claire Croiza (1882-1946) argued that in Chabrier's m\u00e9lodies there is \"a male quality that a woman singer can never give entirely. It must be a man who drinks well and eats well\". She continued, \"There is a basic roundness, and frankness. Fug\u00e8re knew how to sing Chabrier. He brought to it his own roundness, his joviality.\"Claire Croiza: The Singer as Interpreter (Paris: Gollancz, 1989), p. 78\u201379. The pianist and scholar Graham Johnson comments in relation to several of the songs that the demands on the singer, particularly in range of expression, can be extreme, for example \"Ivresses!\". In his book on the composer, his spiritual descendant, Francis Poulenc, contends that the difficulty for many singers \u2013 amateur and professional \u2013 is that Chabrier's songs fall half-way between the concert platform and the stage. He cites Jane Bathori, Roger Bourdin and Pierre Bernac as singers of his time who sought to keep their spirit alive in performance.Francis Poulenc: Emmanuel Chabrier (Paris/Geneva: La Palatine, 1961), p. 108\u2013109. A complete edition of the 25 original songs (excluding the regional folk song arrangements), edited and with an introduction by Roger Delage, was published in 1995 (Heugel, Paris), including two which had never before been published, Le Pas d'armes du roi Jean and Ivresses.Jacques Girard: Emmanuel Chabrier: d'Ambert \u00e0 Paris (Champeti\u00e8res: \u00c9d. de la Montmarie, 2009), p. 194\u2013195. ==Early songs== Victor de Laprade Th\u00e9odore de Banville Couplets de Mariette \u2013 \u00ab Son absence me d\u00e9sesp\u00e8re \u00bb (Mariette's song : \"His absence makes me despair\") (1862) \u2013 anon. Mariette laments the loss of her partner of 15 years. Johnson sees a precursor of the \"Chanson de l'alouette\" from Act 1 of Le Roi malgr\u00e9 lui. Darius Milhaud inserted the song, with new words by Ren\u00e9 Chalupt, into a production of Une \u00e9ducation manqu\u00e9e for Diaghilev in Monte Carlo in 1924.Buckle, Richard. Diaghilev. Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1979, p. 414. L'Enfant \u2013 \u00ab L'enfant est roi parmi nous \u00bb (\"The child rules us as a king\") (1862) \u2013 words by Victor de Laprade (from Idylles h\u00e9ro\u00efques, 1855). Parents welcome the arrival of a baby, and an impending exacting presence in the home. Ronde gauloise \u2013 \u00ab J'ai vu la fille du meunier \u00bb (\"I saw the miller's daughter\") (1862) \u2013 anon. The song evokes a bourr\u00e9e folk song as a young man gives voice to his love. Le Sentier sombre \u2013 \u00ab Il est un sentier sombre au fond de nos vall\u00e9es \u00bb (\"There's a shady path down in the valley\") (1862) \u2013 anon. A country lad recalls his first love. Lied \u2013 \u00ab Avec ces traits harmonieux \u00bb (\"with these harmonious features\") (1862) \u2013 words by Th\u00e9odore de Banville ('Inviolata' from Am\u00e9thystes, 1862). Another love song, where the performers are instructed to sing \"con passione\". Chants d'oiseaux \u2013 \u00ab Quand nous chantons nos amours \u00bb (Bird songs :\"When we sing about our love\") (1862) \u2013 words by Victor de Laprade (in the Livre troisi\u00e8me of Rose Mystica from Idylles h\u00e9ro\u00efques, 1855). Johnson regards it as \"one of Chabrier's earliest masterpieces \u2013 a perfect example of his musical conjuring\". Predating the barnyard songs, in this second Laprade setting, a bird in a tree comments on the vicissitudes of human love. S\u00e9r\u00e9nade \u2013 \u00ab La plus charmante femme \u00bb (\"The most charming woman\") (1862) \u2013 words by the painter, sculptor and poet Auguste de Ch\u00e2tillon (from \u00c0 la Grand'Pinte, 1860). A man sings of his obsessive love. Adieux \u00e0 Suzon (1862) \u2013 words by Alfred de Musset (1852; later set by Bizet in 1866). A man's vigorous farewell to his love which ends in \"renunciation and gentle melancholy\" (Johnson). Musicologist Winton Dean describes Bizet's version as a \"delightful setting of a half-tender, half-mocking love poem\",Dean, Winton. Bizet. J M Dent & Sons Ltd, London, 3rd edition, 1978 reprint, p153. but Delage considers that Chabrier's setting, with its triple rhythm, sly chromaticism in the bass line, all part of an \"allegro risoluto ed appassionato\" captures better the mood of the poet.Delage, 1999, p. 79 Ah! petit d\u00e9mon (\u00ab Ha, little devil \u00bb) (1862) \u2013 words by Auguste de Ch\u00e2tillon (from \u00c0 la Grand'Pinte, 1860). The second Ch\u00e2tillon setting concerns the 'little devil' who comes to steal the singer's grapes at midnight. ==The developing songwriter== Victor Hugo Le pas d'armes du roi Jean \u2013 \u00ab \u00c7a! qu'on selle \u00bb (\"Right, saddle-up\") (1866) \u2013 words by Victor Hugo (Ballade XII from Odes et Ballades, 1826). The song is about a page who falls in a tournament. The young Saint-Sa\u00ebns set fourteen of Hugo's 32 verses in 1852; Chabrier set eight. \"One must admire Saint-Sa\u00ebns's skill in making a long and effective piece out of unpromising material [...] how much better Chabrier captures, right from the start, the spirit of the festive joust with music which rattles jovially between the hands\", Johnson comments. Chabrier regularly sang this song at the Marquise de Ricard's Parnassian salon. It evokes the galop of a horse and plays on ambivalence between modal and tonal harmony, creating new and strange effects.Delage, Roger. Chabrier M\u00e9lodiste. In: Emmanuel Chabrier. Ostinato rigore \u2013 revue internationale d'\u00e9tudes musicales. No.3, 1994, Jean-Michel Place/Centre national du livre, Paris, p. 59. Ivresses! Grande Valse \u2013 \u00ab Viens! je veux les caresses \u00bb (\"Come, I want your caresses\") (1869) \u2013 words by L\u00e9on Labarre. The song is about uncontrollable physical love with wild and impassioned pleas for wine and kisses; Delage describes the words of this song as \"improbable\" (\u00ab invraisemblables \u00bb) but Chabrier manages through two gay and rhythmic waltzes to evoke the world of the caf\u00e9-concert. The music reappears subsequently in his Suite de valses of 1872.Delage, Roger. Chabrier M\u00e9lodiste. In: Emmanuel Chabrier. Ostinato rigore \u2013 revue internationale d'\u00e9tudes musicales. No.3, 1994, Jean-Michel Place/Centre national du livre, Paris, p59. After a vivace introduction, interrupted by a mysterious andante, the first waltz mimes musically an ardent, unbuttoned love. The second waltz 'espress. Ed appassionato' starts after a short recitative like passage ; the first waltz returns with new harmonies. Notes on the score (cymbal, timpani, violins) indicate that Chabrier had an orchestration in mind.Delage Fayard 1999 p126. Steven Huebner notes that Chabrier's melodies (instrumental and vocal) are frequently combined with chromatic decoration, citing as an example 'Ivresses'.Huebner, Steven: 'Chabrier, Emmanuel', The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed. S. Sadie and J. Tyrrell (London: Macmillan, 2001), v, 403-408. L'invitation au voyage (1870) \u2013 \u00ab Mon enfant, ma s\u0153ur, songe \u00e0 la douceur d'aller l\u00e0-bas \u00bb (Call to expedition : \"My child, sister, think how sweet to go over there\") words by Charles Baudelaire (from Les Fleurs du mal, 1855, 1857), set at the same time by Duparc (two verses only). This is about lovers escaping to a place of luxury, calm and sensuality. Chabrier's longest song contains an obbligato part for bassoon. Chabrier savoured the richness of full 9th harmonics; the phrase \"d'aller l\u00e0-bas vivre ensemble\" in this song is \"set to a succession of 9th chords with root movement by a 5th. The whole song is a study in such harmonies where Chabrier pays particular attention to the colour of the 9th in different registers of the keyboard and even the voice\". S\u00e9r\u00e9nade de Ruy Blas \u2013 \u00ab \u00c0 quoi bon entendre les oiseaux des bois ? \u00bb (\"Why listen to the birds from the woods\" \u2013 the most tender bird sings in your voice...) (1873, published in 1913) words by Victor Hugo (from Act II of Ruy Blas, 1838; off-stage voices of laundrywomen). Set in 17th century Spain; the music follows the text closely. It features a lively ritournelle between the verses and a close of softness and mystery, briefly and unexpectedly turning to the sub-dominant, very typical of the composer. A rich and lavish accompaniment sets out it apart from the typical French romance, ranging \u2013 with embellishments, shades of modal hue and chromaticism \u2013 across the whole keyboard.Delage, Roger. Chabrier M\u00e9lodiste. In: Emmanuel Chabrier. Ostinato rigore \u2013 revue internationale d'\u00e9tudes musicales. No.3, 1994, Jean-Michel Place/Centre national du livre, Paris, p60. Composed in the same year as Chabrier's ground-breaking Impromptu for piano, Roy Howat writes that it could easily pass for Wolf.Roy Howat. The Art of French Piano Music \u2013 Debussy, Ravel, Faur\u00e9, Chabrier. Yale University Press, 2014, p363, n32. ==Full-time composer== Sommation irrespectueuse \u2013 \u00ab Rire, \u00e9tant si jolie, c'est mal \u00bb (Disrespectful address : \"Laughter, being so pretty, is wrong\") (1880) \u2013 words by Victor Hugo (Sommation irrespectueuse, VIII. of L'\u00e9ternel petit roman, VI. from Les Chansons des Rues et des Bois, 1865). This dark song was composed in August 1880 when the Chabriers were on holiday at Saint-Pair-sur-Mer; another poem from the same Hugo collection at the same time inspired Idylle, the sixth Pi\u00e8ces pittoresques. The song was premiered at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Musique on 9 April 1881 by L\u00e9on Melchiss\u00e9dec, like Chabrier from Auvergne. Modal colouration is present again, though Delage contends that Chabrier's use of modes differs from his younger friend Faur\u00e9, in coming from \"popular music imbibed in childhood, rather than through formal study of 16th century music\".Delage, Roger. Chabrier M\u00e9lodiste. In: Emmanuel Chabrier. Ostinato rigore \u2013 revue internationale d'\u00e9tudes musicales. No.3 , 1994, Jean-Michel Place/Centre national du livre, Paris, p. 61. Howat remarks that this song, with echoes of Mussorgsky (specifically \"In the corner\", no.2 from The Nursery), is probably the earliest example of the assimilation of contemporary Russian musical syntax into French music, and which Chabrier would have been exposed to only via scores, as Mussorgsky's songs were not heard in Paris until the mid 1890s.Roy Howat. The Art of French Piano Music \u2013 Debussy, Ravel, Faur\u00e9, Chabrier. Yale University Press, 2014, p. 127. Johnson adds that the verses 16 to 18 are \"set to some of the most frantic music in all Chabrier\". Credo d'amour \u2013 \u00ab Je crois aux choses \u00e9ternelles \u00bb (Love creed : \"I believe in things eternal\") (1883) \u2013 words by Armand Silvestre ('Credo' from La chanson des heures, 1878). A few years previously Chabrier had begun work with Silvestre on Le Sabbat, a two-act op\u00e9ra comique, which was not completed. The words reflect the composer's regular praise of the female sex. It is dedicated to Mme Enoch, wife of one of his publishers.Desaymard, Joseph. Un Artiste Auvergnat \u2013 Emmanuel Chabrier. Imprimeries G Mont-Louis (Clermont-Ferrand), Librairie Fischbacher (Paris), 1908, p. 63 Index Bibliographique \u2013 Oeuvres d'Emmanuel Chabrier. \"Espa\u00f1a\" \u2013 \u00ab \u00c0 S\u00e9ville, s\u00e9jour o\u00f9 les roses \u00bb (\"In Seville, where the roses bloom\") (1883) \u2013 the words by Eug\u00e8ne Adenis were written to fit the most famous work by Chabrier, his orchestral rhapsody of 1883, one of several arrangements of the work. Tes yeux bleus (1883) \u2013 words by Maurice Rollinat (from Les n\u00e9vroses, 1883). The song is about the pleasures of sensual enjoyment. With words by a close colleague, Chabrier seems here to have absorbed the musical language of the love duets from Tristan und Isolde, which he had seen and heard in Munich in 1880. The song was first heard in public in 1887 at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale. Although Wagnerian techniques abound \u2013 unorthodox scales and cadences, rhythmic ambiguities between and \u2013 Chabrier retains his own voice. The manuscript carries a sub-title romance, implying the old French form, which is highlighted by use of the title words as a refrain.Delage, Roger. Chabrier M\u00e9lodiste. In: Emmanuel Chabrier. Ostinato rigore \u2013 revue internationale d'\u00e9tudes musicales. No.3, 1994, Jean-Michel Place/Centre national du livre, Paris, p. 62. Howat sees a precedent here for the Adagio assai second movement of Ravel's G major concerto \u00ab with its undercurrent of across its slow metre \u00bb.Roy Howat. The Art of French Piano Music \u2013 Debussy, Ravel, Faur\u00e9, Chabrier. Yale University Press, 2014, p. 195. Maurice Rollinat One writer has noted that it is an example of Chabrier's gift \"one which eluded so many of his contemporaries \u2013 of allowing his music to be suffused by the influence of Wagner whilst still retaining his own distinctive voice\". Although the music includes clear allusions to the German composer \u2013 a pulsating quaver accompaniment, extended, arching vocal lines, and the echoes of the Liebestod in the final bars \u2013 Chabrier adds \"with the lightest of touches, other dimensions which are entirely his own such as the delicate cross-rhythms in the accompaniment.Christopher Glynn. Programme note for 'Une rare \u00e9motion \u2013 The songs of Maurice Ravel and his circle'. Wigmore Hall, 15 January 2012. This is the only song to have been orchestrated by Chabrier \u2013 for strings.Delage 1999 p. 706-707. Lied \u2013 \u00ab Nez au vent, c\u0153ur plein d'aise \u00bb (\"Into the breeze, happy at heart\") (1886) \u2013 words by Catulle Mend\u00e8s (from Philom\u00e9la, 1863) This the second Chabrier song with this title, but on a very different subject matter; marked \"gaiement\", it concerns an encounter between Berthe and an elf in the woods who tempts her to go and pick strawberries off the beaten path. In his book on Chabrier, Poulenc wrote \"I know of nothing so insolent in French song\".Poulenc, Francis. Emmanuel Chabrier. La Palatine, Paris/Geneva, 1961, p. 109 (\"Je ne sais rien d'aussi impertinent dans la m\u00e9lodie fran\u00e7aise\". He also describes the poem as \"fripon\", or \"roguish\" and the whole song as \"d'une fantaisie extraordinaire\". Bernac describes this as a \"gay, naughty, (and very 1890s) little poem, so wonderfully expressed musically\", and recommends a strict tempo with no rubato.Bernac, 1970, p. 85. Delage points out that Berthe has lost her way in the uncertain tonality of the opening ritournelle; only rediscovering it in bar nine. Although in couplets, each one is varied according to the words enlivened by the melody straying into different registers while the accompaniment frees itself into roguish dissonances.Delage 1999, p. 353. Chanson pour Jeanne \u2013 \u00ab Puisque les roses sont jolies \u00bb (\"Since the roses are pretty\") (1886) \u2013 words by Catulle Mend\u00e8s (from Interm\u00e8de, 1885) It was in connection with this song (entitled 'Romance') that Chabrier wrote a notable letter to his publishers Enoch in which he vouched that its music \"is certainly music of today or tomorrow, but not of yesterday\", adding \"This romance, you doubtlessly won't understand any of it, at first glance; I will play it to you in three weeks... do not make a judgement until you have studied it\". It was dedicated to \u00c9mile Engel, who had created the r\u00f4le of Armel in Chabrier's Gwendoline in April 1886 and remained a friend.Delage, Roger. Chabrier M\u00e9lodiste. In: Emmanuel Chabrier. Ostinato rigore \u2013 revue internationale d'\u00e9tudes musicales. No.3, 1994, Jean-Michel Place/Centre national du livre, Paris, p. 63. Although the song is basically strophic, the composer creates modulations by juxtaposition of a differing melodic vision and adding foreign notes to ordinary chords of the scale.Delage, Roger. Chabrier M\u00e9lodiste. In: Emmanuel Chabrier. Ostinato rigore \u2013 revue internationale d'\u00e9tudes musicales. No.3, 1994, Jean-Michel Place/Centre national du livre, Paris, p. 64. Chabrier's subtly equivocal harmonies here are so original in their application that they had a profound effect of the musical development of Ravel.Gerald Larner. Programme notes, Wigmore Hall Song Recital Series, 10 February 2011, Wigmore Hall, London. In his 'Esquisse autobiographique' of 1928, Ravel wrote \"the Habanera [Ravel, 1895] embodies many of the elements which were to dominate my later compositions, and which through Chabrier's influence (as for instance in the \"Chanson pour Jeanne\") I have been able to crystallize\". Ravel brought this song to his harmony classes under Pessard.Roland-Manuel. Maurice Ravel. Dennis Dobson Ltd, London, 1947, p. 22 and 20 (translated from the French 1938 edition by Cynthia Jolly). Markings \"dolce\" and \"espressivo\" predominate. Bernac considers this as \"another m\u00e9lodie extremely rubato. The numerous changes in tempo, the dynamics and nuances are carefully indicated and should be observed\".Bernac, 1970, p. 83. == Les plus jolies chansons du pays de France == In 1888 Chabrier arranged sixteen French folk songs for an anthology called Le plus jolies chansons du pays de France. He was among the first important composers at this time to work in this way with folk songs, a pioneer for Ravel, Bart\u00f3k, Britten and others. Johnson comments that Chabrier's touch in these pieces is \"deceptively light and restrained\", but that the piano writing adds enormously to the charm of the music. *Les M\u00e9tamorphoses \u2013 'Chanson canadienne' (No.7) \u2013 Canada a circular song in where the lovers 'transform' themselves until they eventually catch each other. *Sur le bord de l'\u00eele \u2013 'Chanson champenoise' (No.13) \u2013 from Champagne. A girl drops her gold ring in the river and a young man drowns trying to rescue it. *Les Filles de trente ans \u2013 'Chanson angoumoisine' (No.16) \u2013 from Angoumois \u2026are too old and have missed out on love. *Marion s'en va-t-a l'ou \u2013 'Chanson auvergnate' (No.19) \u2013 from Auvergne ; a song also found in Poitou and Angoul\u00eame. *La Mie du voleur \u2013 'Chanson agenoise' (No.20), where a girl refuses the hand of a swordsman in favour of a thief. *Que les amants ont de la peine! \u2013 'Chanson poitevine' (No.21) \u2013 from Poitou \u2013 the tribulations of lovers. *Le Flambeau \u00e9teint \u2013 'Chanson nivernaise' (No.24) \u2013 from Nivernais (a song also found in Nordic countries), where the torch in the title lures the handsome youth to death by his lover's father. *Joli dragon \u2013 'Chanson languedocienne' (No.25) \u2013 from Languedoc where a handsome soldier, courted by a lady, returns to his own land where the girls are prettier. *Nique nac no muse! \u2013 'Chanson normande' (No.26) \u2013 from Normandy. The title words are nonsense, but a man is overcome by the beauty of his sweetheart. *La Bien-aim\u00e9e \u2013 'Chanson angoumoisine' (No.29) where a girl wanders by the river with three young men. *La Mort de la brune \u2013 'Chanson franc-comtoise' (No.31) \u2013 from Franche-Comt\u00e9. An elegy on a dying girl. *Les Gar\u00e7ons de Bordeaux \u2013 'Chanson bordelaise' (No.32) is a sailor's song. *Berg\u00e8re et Chasseur \u2013 'Chanson poitevine' (No.33). A huntsman fails to seduce a shepherdess, whose lover is in the king's service in Paris. *La Fleur dor\u00e9e \u2013 'Chanson agenoise' (No.34) compares the yellow flowers of the field with a gold flower in the heart. *Entrez, la Belle en vigne \u2013 'Chanson saintongeoise' (No.35) \u2013 from Saintonge. A young woman hesitates to enter the vineyard because of the thorns, but is persuaded by the offer of gloves. *Le D\u00e9serteur \u2013 'Chanson poitevine' (No.36) ==Late songs== 6 m\u00e9lodies (1890) come just before the onset of the degeneration of Chabrier's health as he completed his last piano work, the Bourr\u00e9e fantasque, and struggled to get his opera Bris\u00e9\u00efs committed to manuscript. Of these six, a group of four songs with a linking theme is what Chabrier called his \"volailleries\" [fowl songs], to lyrics by Edmond Rostand and Rosemonde G\u00e9rard, with subjects including fat turkeys, little ducklings, pink pigs and chirping cicadas. Rollo Myers comments that these songs \"could have been written by no one else\", and that in the four \"farmyard songs\", as they are more usually referred to, Chabrier \"made musical history\" where \"the salient features of each of the creatures portrayed are underlined with a most disarming mixture of irony, humour and realism\". Although Offenbach (1842) and Lecocq (among others) had set some of La Fontaine's animal fables to music, Chabrier \"introduced a new note into contemporary French music\", prefiguring Ravel's Histoires naturelles.Myers, Rollo. Emmanuel Chabrier and his circle. Associated University Presses, Cranbury, 1970, p. 90-91. Although he did not complete others in a similar vein, Coquelin Cadet wrote to Chabrier asking him to write a Ballade des Veaux (also referrred to by Chabrier as Valse des Veaux).Delage p. 528 Portrait of Edmond Rostand.jpg|Rostand Rosemonde G\u00e9rard.jpg|and G\u00e9rard Ballade des gros dindons \u2013 \u00ab Les gros dindons, \u00e0 travers champs \u00bb (1889) \u2013 words by Edmond Rostand (according to Delage the verse may have been written expressly for Chabrier). It is marked \"b\u00eatement\" (stupidly). Compared with other Chabrier songs, the Ballade lacks harmonic complexity; but it is full of humour \u2013 the turkeys \"seem to essay the steps of a habanera, while the serenade from Don Giovanni sounds out where one would least expect \u2013 like a punch on the nose\". Delage muses that Chabrier's friend Manet, whose Les Dindons was first seen in 1877, causing mad laughter from its first viewers, may have planted a seed in the composer's mind.Delage, Roger. Chabrier M\u00e9lodiste. In: Emmanuel Chabrier. Ostinato rigore \u2013 revue internationale d'\u00e9tudes musicales. No.3 , 1994, Jean-Michel Place/Centre national du livre, Paris, p. 67. Bernac comments \"The ritornello imitating comically the mandolin accompaniment of the serenade of Mozart's Don Giovanni should be played with no rubato at all, no hurry, flatly and fatuously\".Bernac, 1970, p. 86. It is dedicated to Jeanne Granier. In Chabrier's Cocodette et Cocorico (1878) the singers were a rooster and a hen. Villanelle des petits canards \u2013 \u00ab Ils vont, les petits canards \u00bb (1889) \u2013 words by Rosemonde G\u00e9rard (from Les Pipeaux); marked \"tr\u00e8s simplement et tr\u00e8s rythm\u00e9\", Johnson asks \"has there ever been a more witty use of syncopation and silence in musical characterization?\". Bernac again argues for \"precise and immutable\" rhythm and tempo in this song.Bernac, 1970, p. 88. It is dedicated to Mily-Meyer, although Chabrier was not satisfied with her interpretation.Chabrier E. Correspondance. Ed Delage R, Durif F. Klincksieck, 1994. 90-46. Pastorale des cochons roses \u2013 \u00ab Le jour s'annonce \u00e0 l'Orient \u00bb (1889) \u2013 words by Edmond Rostand from Les Musardises. It is dedicated to Lucien Fug\u00e8re. As dawn breaks, a farmboy takes a drift of pigs along a path, who proceed to play all day until they are led back to their bed where they all fall asleep. Huebner notes the \"naive pastoral 5ths\" which underpin \"long dissonant chords in the right hand\". Les Cigales \u2013 \u00ab Le soleil est droit sur la sente \u00bb (1889) \u2013 words by Rosemonde G\u00e9rard (from Les Pipeaux). The monotonous chirping in the piano dissonances. The cicadas have \"more soul than viols and sing better than violins\". The piano part suggests the grating of the cicadas in the warm atmosphere of the south of France at noon.Bernac, 1970, p. 89. Johnson draws a comparison with the song Les Grillons by Bizet, where the younger composer anticipates Chabrier with an \u00ab astonishing tour de force in the manner of the lively cicadas of Chabrier \u00bb.p24 Myers sees Ravel's harmonic formula for the grillon winding up her watch in his Histoires naturelles is \"an actual crib of Chabrier's ingenious way of suggesting the shrill chirping of the cicadas\".Myers, Rollo. Emmanuel Chabrier and his circle. Associated University Presses, Cranbury, 1970, p. 92. Delage goes further, saying that the \"extension of what one finds in the astonishing accompaniment of the song Les Cigales, with its minor seconds under direct attack, bursts forth in Jeux d'eau and Ondine\".Delage, Roger. Ravel and Chabrier. Musical Quarterly, 1975, p. 550. It is dedicated to his niece Isabelle Jacmart. Manuel Rosenthal made orchestrations of the piano part of the volailleries, which were then performed by Madeleine Grey with Rosenthal conducting at the Concerts Colonne in 1935.'Concerts Colonne' (M.P.) Le M\u00e9nestrel 22 novembre 1935, p. 353. Toutes les fleurs \u2013 \u00ab Toutes les fleurs, certes, je les adore ! \u00bb (1889) \u2013 words by Edmond Rostand. The markings are \"appassionato, con fuoco\" and \"tr\u00e8s joyeux\". The poet adores all the flowers but above all he is in love with lilacs and roses. In 1909 Reynaldo Hahn made a recording of this song, accompanying himself at the piano.Worldcat entry for vocal recordings by Hahn accessed 20 April 2019. It is dedicated to Chabrier's friend Ernest Van Dyck. In a letter of January 1890, Chabrier wrote to the dedicatee ('N\u00e9nerst') that the song is an \"irresistible salon outpouring\", and included a sketch of the first four bars of the vocal part.Chabrier E. Correspondance. Ed Delage R, Durif F. Klincksieck, 1994. 90-8. L'\u00cele heureuse \u2013 \u00ab Dans le golfe aux jardins ombreux \u00bb (1889) (The Joyous Isle : \"In the gulf with shady gardens\") \u2013 words by Ephra\u00efm Mikha\u00ebl, marked \"Animato, molto rubato ed appassionato\" (animated with much rubato and passion), and when the voice enters \"con slancio\" (with abandon). One writer called it \"one of the most beautiful of all evocations of a voyage to mythic Cythera\", through its \"yearning chromatic harmonies and swelling and rocking rhythms\". Bernac describes the poem as \"mediocre and rather unimportant\", but the singer requires a lyricism \"approaching caricature\".Bernac, 1970, p. 82. Howat sees echoes of this song in Debussy's \"Le balcon\" of the same year.Roy Howat. The Art of French Piano Music \u2013 Debussy, Ravel, Faur\u00e9, Chabrier. Yale University Press, 2014, p. 84. Ninon Vallin, accompanied by Alberto de Pierlas, recorded \"L'\u00cele heureuse\" in 1933, and Hahn accompanied himself in 1909 and 1927.Discographical data from search for Chabrier songs in The CHARM Discography, Centre for the History and Analysis of Recorded Music, , accessed 2 July 2019. ===Other vocal works=== Duo de l'ouvreuse de l'Op\u00e9ra-Comique et de l'employ\u00e9 du Bon March\u00e9 (Duet of the usherette from the Op\u00e9ra-Comique and the employee of the Bon-March\u00e9 department store) is a comic vocal work for soprano and tenor, with piano accompaniment. The lyrics are by Paul Fuchs and Henry Lyon. \u2013 \u00ab Le sort jadis ne me faisait pas f\u00eate comme aujourd'hui \u00bb (1888) \u00c0 la musique is for solo soprano, women's chorus and orchestra (or piano). The words are by Edmond Rostand. ==Recordings== The creators did not leave recordings of their songs, although Fug\u00e8re did record two airs from Le Roi malgr\u00e9 lui in 1930. Hahn accompanied himself in three Chabrier songs: \"Les Cigales\" in 1919, \"L'\u00cele heureuse\" in 1909 and 1927, and \"Toutes les fleurs\" in 1919 and 1927.
