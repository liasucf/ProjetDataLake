It was created in 1979, and has about 6,879 students distributed across a multiplicity of graduation courses, awarding all academic degrees in fields ranging from medicine and biomedical sciences to aeronautical engineering to mathematics. The university is named after the historical Beira region, meaning Beira Interior the most interior area of Beira, mainly composed by the district of Guarda and the district of Castelo Branco, in today's Centro region. == History == In August 1973, following a major change in the national higher education system, the government established a polytechnical institution in Covilh\u00e3, the Polytechnic Institute of Covilh\u00e3 (IPC - Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico da Covilh\u00e3), which was the first higher education institution in the city. Over the years, the IPC facilities, as well as the enrolment and staff, never ceased to grow. This growth and the region's needs, led the IPC to a remarkable level of achievements that granted it, in 1979, to be promoted, by the Portuguese Ministry of Education, to a higher institutional level, university institute. Seven years later, in 1986, the University Institute of Beira Interior was granted full university status and renamed University of Beira Interior (Universidade da Beira Interior). == Organisation == For teaching and research purposes, UBI is organised into five Faculties. The Faculties are organised in Departments: *The Faculty of Sciences includes the Department of Mathematics, Informatics; Physics; and Chemistry. *The Faculty of Engineering Sciences includes the Departments of Textile Science and Technology; Paper Science and Technology; Electromechanical Engineering; Civil Engineering; and Aerospace Sciences. *The Faculty of Human and Social Sciences is made up of the Department of Management and Economics; Department of Sociology; Department of Education Sciences and the Department of Sports Sciences. *The Faculty of Arts and Letters includes the Department of Communication and Arts; and the Department of Letters *The Faculty of Health Sciences includes the Department of Medical Sciences.

The university academic campus is well integrated in the city urban network and it has unique characteristics based on Covilh\u00e3 industrial roots. The city was an important textile centre, once known as the \"Portuguese Manchester\". Over the last decades the city witnessed a restructuring of this industry. However, many factories were not able to meet the requirements of the global market and had to close down. Some of their former buildings, after being renovated by the University of Beira Interior, are started the 21st century serving the noble purpose of educating the Portuguese society. Over 250,000 m2 of buildings are dedicated to academic activities and social services. The university campus is divided into several spaces, called P\u00f3los, which are spread through the city establishing a real symbiosis between the city and the university as a public institution. The synopsis below provides information about the P\u00f3los of UBI and its libraries: *P\u00f3lo I - The main building is a 17th-century textile factory that was renovated to house part of the university services, classrooms and offices.

It has a total area of 16,000 m2 situated nearby the Central Hospital in a distance of 1 km far from P\u00f3lo I. *P\u00f3lo IV - This area is located in northern part of the city and was created to facilitate the expansion of the university. It houses the Faculty of Human and Social Sciences, the Cyber Centre and a residence hall with Snack Bar. *Libraries - UBI has three libraries.

All the rooms are equipped with closets, desks, chairs, beds and central heating. One or two students are assigned to each room. The Students' Social Affairs Centre manages all the university housing offers. == Students' union == The students' union, AAUBI - Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Acad\u00e9mica da Universidade da Beira Interior , is headquartered within the old part of the town, near Santa Maria church. The union also has its office in P\u00f3lo I, two floors upstairs from the bank. The students' union (AAUBI) offers a wide range of activities concerning sports, culture and leisure. During the whole year there are many indoor events such like chess meetings or activities in sports halls as climbing, volleyball, basketball, football, badminton and table tennis. A freshmen reception week, organised by the students' union of the University of Beira Interior, takes place in November and includes a parade through town (the Latada) and several concerts. == Online radio, television and journal == The university has an online radio - R\u00e1dio Universit\u00e1ria da Beira Interior , an online television - Televis\u00e3o Universit\u00e1ria da Beira Interior , and an online journal - Urbi et Orbi . == Athletics == The University of Beira Interior has two indoor sports pavilions, among other sports facilities. Competitive varsity sports teams of UBI include badminton, basketball, futsal, handball, rugby union and volleyball. == Wool museum == Wool museum entrance, to the right, which is delimited by two pedestrian bridges that connect two of the UBI's buildings The UBI adapted the buildings of the former Real F\u00e1brica de Panos (Royal Textile Factory), an important national woollens manufacturer established by Marqu\u00eas de Pombal in 1764. This building served as a spinning, dyeing and weaving mill until 1885, when it was handed over to lodge the Regimento de Infantaria 21 (21st Infantry Regiment), and later the Batalh\u00e3o de Ca\u00e7adores 2 (2nd Sharpshooters Battalion). In 1975, during the recovery and adaptation works of the building, archaeological remains of the old textile mill were discovered. The vats of the former dye- house were found. The discovery was classified as a part of the national cultural heritage and it was carefully recovered and restored. According to the museum's educational role, the discovered structures are helping to portray the dyeing processes used in Portugal in the second half of the 18th century. Guided tours are available (free for UBI students). The museum is open on weekdays except Monday from 9:30h to midday and from 14:30h to 18h. == See also == *List of universities in Portugal *Higher education in Portugal * Air Cargo Challenge ==References== == External links == *University of Beira Interior *UBI (P\u00f3lo I) viewed from satellite *UBI on Facebook *UBI on Twitter *UBI on Instagram *UBI on Buzz * *ic mimarlik Category:Educational institutions established in 1979 Beira Category:1979 establishments in Portugal Category:Buildings and structures in Castelo Branco District Category:Covilh\u00e3 ",
