    "text": "Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, 2016 (PMGKY) (English, Prime Minister's Poor welfare scheme) is a scheme launched by the Narendra Modi led Government of India in December 2016 on the lines of the Income declaration scheme, 2016 (IDS) launched earlier in the year. A part of the Taxation Laws (Second Amendment) Act, 2016, the scheme provides an opportunity to declare unaccounted wealth and black money in a confidential manner and avoid prosecution after paying a fine of 50% on the undisclosed income. An additional 25% of the undisclosed income is invested in the scheme which can be refunded after four years, without any interest. Valid from December 16, 2016 to March 31, 2017, the scheme can only be availed to declare income in the form of cash or bank deposits in Indian bank accounts and not in the form of jewellery, stock, immovable property, or deposits in overseas accounts. Not declaring undisclosed income under the PMGKY will attract a fine of 77.25% if the income is shown in tax returns. In case the income is not shown in tax returns, it will attract a further 10% penalty followed by prosecution. ==2020 coronavirus pandemic== During the COVID-19 pandemic in India, Finance Minister announced a \u20b91.70 Lakh Crore($24 billion) relief package under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana for the poor. * \u20b9500 each to 19.86 crore women Jan Dhan account holders * LPG cylinders to be provided to 8 crore poor families for the next three months free of cost. * \u20b91,000 for senior citizens to tide over difficulties during next three months. * As of 11 April, \u20b928,256 crores($4 billion) were disbursed through PMGKY to nearly 32 crore beneficiaries. * Rs 50,000-Crore in Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan For returnee migrant workers == See also == * 2016 Indian banknote demonetisation * Income declaration scheme, 2016 == References == Category:Poverty in India Category:Modi administration initiatives Category:Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment Category:Income tax in India Category:2016 in Indian economy ",
