    "text": "1799 was the 13th season of cricket in England since the foundation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Surrey again defeated All-England three times. As in the previous year, the number of matches may have declined due to the impact of the Napoleonic War. Fewer were reported but there was loose censorship in place. A cricket club was formed at Seringapatam in south India after the successful British siege. == Matches == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" ! width=\"125\" | Date ! width=\"250\" | Match Title ! width=\"125\" | Venue ! width=\"50\" | Source ! width=\"200\" | Result |- | 10\u201311 June (M-Tu) | MCC v Thursday Club ^ | Lord's (Dorset Square) | SB252 | Thursday Club won by 54 runs |- | colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:85%;border- color:#aaa #fff;background-color:#fff;\"| |- | 17\u201318 June (M-Tu) | Montpelier v Richmond & Brentford # | Montpelier Gardens | SB253 | Montpelier won by 91 runs |- | colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:85%;border-color:#aaa #fff;background- color:#fff;\"| |- | 24\u201326 June (M-W) | MCC v Thursday Club ^ | Lord's (Dorset Square) | SB254 | MCC won by 41 runs |- | colspan=\"5\" style=\"font- size:85%;border-color:#aaa #fff;background-color:#fff;\"| ^ The two MCC games against its own Thursday Club are important matches as the majority of players on each side are recognised. The Thursday Club was effectively Middlesex. |- | 27\u201328 June (Th-F) | Richmond & Brentford v Montpelier | Richmond Green | SB254 | Montpelier won by 148 runs |- | colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:85%;border- color:#aaa #fff;background-color:#fff;\"| The Montpelier v Richmond and Brentford games in S&B; (p. 253-255) were important matches despite some \"unknowns\" in the Richmond & Brentford sides and the results went convincingly in favour of Montpelier. The match status dilemma is almost solved by MCC games against similar sides since 1797. Thus, if a good quality town club with given men or at any rate a full team of recognised players competes against a good quality MCC side (or against All-England or a recognised county team), that is an important match. If it is a case of two such town clubs playing each other without a good number of noted given men, the game is probably not important. |- | 30 July - 1 Aug (Tu-Th) | All-England v Surrey | Lord's (Dorset Square) | SB259 | Surrey won by 8 wkts |- | colspan=\"5\" style=\"font- size:85%;border-color:#aaa #fff;background-color:#fff;\"| |- | 1-3 Aug (Th-S) | R Whitehead v Lord Yarmouth | Lord's (Dorset Square) | SB259 | Yarmouth's XI won by 4 wkts |- | colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:85%;border-color:#aaa #fff;background-color:#fff;\"| Evidently the Whitehead v Yarmouth game was arranged ad hoc on 1 Aug as the All-England v Surrey game finished on the same day (most of the players took part in both games) |- | 13-16 Aug (Tu-F) | All- England v Surrey | Lord's (Dorset Square) | SB262 | Surrey won by 143 runs |- | colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:85%;border-color:#aaa #fff;background- color:#fff;\"| |- | 16-17 Aug (F-S) | All-England v Surrey | Lord's (Dorset Square) | SB263 | Surrey won by innings & 117 runs |- | colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:85%;border-color:#aaa #fff;background-color:#fff;\"| Another case of an extra game starting immediately that the first one finished. There is some doubt about the exact date of the second game which ACS have on the 15th as S&B; states that the first game carried over to the 16th. |- | 16-17 Sept (M-Tu) | Waltham & Herts v Middlesex | Waltham Abbey | WDC | drawn |- | colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:85%;border-color:#aaa #fff;background- color:#fff;\"| |- | 23-24 Sept (M-Tu) | Middlesex v Waltham & Herts | Lord's (Dorset Square) | FL18 | Middlesex won by 3 runs |- | colspan=\"5\" style=\"font- size:85%;border-color:#aaa #fff;background-color:#fff;\"| In both these two games, Waltham & Herts was a minor team. Herts played several games in late C18 but needed given men. |- |} ==First mentions== ===Counties=== * Devon ===Clubs and teams=== * ===Players=== * Hockley (Surrey cricketer) (Surrey/Hampshire) - played 8 matches from 1799 to 1805 * Woodroffe (Surrey cricketer) (MCC and Surrey; amateur) - played 4 matches in 1799 & 1800 * Stephen Lushington (cricketer) (Surrey; amateur) - played 3 matches in 1799 ===Venues=== * ==Leading batsmen== Note that many scorecards in the 18th century are unknown or have missing details and so it is impossible to provide a complete analysis of batting performances: e.g., the missing not outs prevent computation of batting averages. The \"runs scored\" are in fact the runs known. With few matches being played, only six batsmen exceeded 150 runs: :Tom Walker - 239 :Jack Small - 235 :John Wells - 231 :Robert Robinson - 227 :John Hammond - 192 :William Beldham - 179 ==Leading bowlers== Note that the wickets credited to an 18th-century bowler were only those where he bowled the batsman out. The bowler was not credited with the wickets of batsmen who were caught out, even if it was \"caught and bowled\". In addition, the runs conceded by each bowler were not recorded so no analyses or averages can be computed. The leading wicket-taker was Thomas Lord with 16 Other top bowlers were John Wells 15; Thomas Boxall 13; Charles Cumberland 11; John Hammond 9 ==Leading fielders== Note that many scorecards in the 18th century are unknown or have missing details and so the totals are of the known catches and stumpings only. Stumpings were not always recorded as such and sometimes the name of the wicket-keeper was not given. Generally, a catch was given the same status as \"bowled\" with credit being awarded to the fielder only and not the bowler. There is never a record of \"caught and bowled\": the bowler would be credited with the catch, not with the wicket. John Wells with 10 ct, 5 st was the leading performer in the field Thomas Ray took 10 ct and other good fielders were Charles Warren 2 ct, 6 st; John Hammond 4 ct, 3 st; Thomas Burgoyne 7 ct; William Barton 7 ct ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * ==Further reading== * * * * * Britcher, Samuel, A list of all the principal Matches of Cricket that have been played (1790 to 1805), annual series * * * ==External links== * * Category:1799 in English cricket Category:English cricket seasons from 1787 to 1815 ",
