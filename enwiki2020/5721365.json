Tottenham Hotspur continued their brilliant start to the 1960s, finishing runners-up in the First Division and going on to lift the European Cup Winners' Cup to become English football's first winners of a European trophy. Burnley, the 1960 league champions, finished third. Leicester City, still yet to win a major trophy, emerge as surprise double challengers but eventually had to settle for a fourth-place finish in the league, and lost to Manchester United in the FA Cup final - with Matt Busby's rebuilding scheme paying off with the success being United's first trophy since the Munich air disaster five years earlier. Liverpool's return to the First Division saw them secure a decent eighth-place finish and their players adapt well to what for many of them was their first season playing in the First Division. Birmingham City's consolation for narrowly avoiding relegation came in the shape of glory in the Football League Cup, the first major trophy of their 88-year history. Leyton Orient's first season in the top flight was a dismal one, and they ended it with relegation and being 12 points adrift of safety. They were joined in relegation by Manchester City, who finally went down after several seasons of gradually falling out of contention for honours. ===Second Division=== Tony Waddington's impressive Stoke City side, which included 48-year-old FWA Footballer of the Year Stanley Matthews, former Manchester United forward Dennis Viollet and former Burnley star Jimmy McIlroy clinched the Second Division title and with it a place in the First Division. Chelsea were promoted as runners-up, while Sunderland missed out on goal average. Luton Town and Walsall went down to the Third Division. ===Third Division=== Northampton Town won the Third Division title and with it a place in the Second Division, while Swindon Town finally climbed out of the league's third tier, having been there since its creation 43 years previously. Halifax Town, Carlisle United, Brighton and Bradford Park Avenue went down to the Fourth Division. ===Fourth Division=== Brentford won the Fourth Division title, their first significant postwar success. Oldham Athletic, Crewe Alexandra and Mansfield Town also went up, while league newcomers Oxford United finished 18th. Bradford City, FA Cup winners in 1911 and First Division members for a number of seasons leading up to 1922, had to apply for re-election. ===Top goalscorers=== First Division *Jimmy Greaves (Tottenham Hotspur) \u2013 37 goals Second Division *Bobby Tambling (Chelsea) \u2013 35 goals Third Division *George Hudson (Coventry City) \u2013 30 goals Fourth Division *Ken Wagstaff (Mansfield Town) \u2013 34 goals ==References== ",
