She was raised at Dangan House outside of Galway City before moving to the small fishing village of Barna. She attended the local primary school where she became proficient in Irish and gained an intimate knowledge of tradition in the Connemara. Dillon's family was involved in Irish revolutionary politics; her uncle Joseph Mary Plunkett was a signatory of the 1916 Proclamation and was executed after the Easter Rising. Educated by the Ursuline nuns in Sligo, she worked briefly in the hotel and catering trade. In 1940 she married Cormac \u00d3 Cuillean\u00e1in, an academic from University College Cork and 17 years her senior. They had at least 3 children, including the Irish poet and Trinity College Dublin professor Eil\u00e9an N\u00ed Chuillean\u00e1in and her brother, Cormac \u00d3 Cuillean\u00e1in, also a Trinity professor, who writes novels as Cormac Millar.Cormac Millar biography, retrieved 7 May 2011. ==Early writing career== Dillon's first books were in Irish including An Choill Bheo, published in 1948, Oscar agus an C\u00f3iste s\u00e9 nEas\u00f3g in 1952 and Ceol na coille in 1955.

While there she acted as adviser to International Commission on English in the Liturgy. She returned to Cork with her husband in 1969 where he died the following year. She continued to visit Italy over the next several years, setting some of her stories there including Living in Imperial Rome (1974) and The Five Hundred (1972), though these were not as popular as her Irish books. In 1974 she married the American-based critic and professor Vivian Mercier, dividing her time between California, Italy and Dublin. ==Later writing career== Dillon's adult fiction career began in 1953 with the publication of the detective novel Death at Crane's Court. This was followed by Sent to His Account in 1954 and Death in the Quadrangle in 1956. These novels are known for their depiction of contemporary Ireland. Over the following decade Dillon published many novels including The Bitter Glass (1959), Across the Bitter Sea (1973) and The Wild Geese (1981). ==Final years== In her later years Dillon played a prominent role in Irish culture.
