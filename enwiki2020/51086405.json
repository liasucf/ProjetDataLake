Resistance to the building of the range also led to the construction of the religious monument Our Lady of the Isles. ==Structure== It is situated in the Outer Hebrides on South Uist. The missiles are tracked from St Kilda, Scotland, a now uninhabited island, which is now leased by the Ministry of Defence. The site is run by QinetiQ, a privatised former division of the MoD.
