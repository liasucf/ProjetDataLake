    "text": "Ana Blandiana, 2019 Ana Blandiana (; pen name of Otilia Valeria Coman; born 25 March 1942, in Timi\u0219oara) is a Romanian poet, essayist, and political figure. She is considered one of the leading contemporary Romanian authors. She took her name after Blandiana, near Vin\u021bu de Jos, Alba County, her mother's home village. In October 2017, she was announced as The Griffin Trust For Excellence In Poetry's twelfth recipient of their Lifetime Recognition Award. ==Literary career== Coman's parents were Gheorghe (1915-1964), an orthodox priest and former member of the fascist Iron Guard who spent years in Communist prisons and died in an accident weeks after his release in a general amnesty, and Otilia (Diacu), an accountant. Her sister Geta was born in 1947. In 1960 she married the writer Romulus Rusan. After her debut in 1959, in Tribuna, Cluj, where she signed for the first time as Ana Blandiana, she was published in the anthology 30 de poe\u021bi tineri (\"30 Young Poets\"). In 1963, after a four-year interdiction due to her father's status, she again published in Contemporanul (edited by George Iva\u0219cu). Her editorial debut took place in 1964 with the booklet of poems Persoana \u00eent\u00e2ia plural (\"First Person Plural\"), with a Foreword written by Nicolae Manolescu. She became known for her Calc\u00e2iul vulnerabil (\"Achilles' Heel\", 1966) and A treia tain\u0103 (\"The Third Secret\", 1969). In 1966, Blandiana appeared for the first time at the International Poem Contest (in Lahti, Finland). In 1967, she settled in Bucharest; until the following year, she was one of the editors for Via\u021ba studen\u021beasc\u0103, and then (until 1975) worked as editor for Amfiteatru. She gave two televised readings in 1969, in the company of Andrei \u0218erban and the actors Irina Petrescu, Mariana Mihu\u021b, and Florian Pitti\u0219. Between 1975 and 1977, she was a librarian at the Institute of Fine Arts in Bucharest. In 1976, her works were first printed in a French translation, in Croisi\u00e8re du Club des Po\u00e8tes by :fr:Jean-Pierre Rosnay (Paris); in 1978, she took part in the First International Festival of Poetry in Paris organized by the famed Club des Po\u00e8tes. In the late 1980s, assuming risks of reprisals by the communist regime, Blandiana started writing protest poems, in answer to the increasingly harsh demands of the system in general. In 1984 Blandiana's poem 'Totul' ('Everything') was briefly published in the literary magazine Amfiteatru. 'Totul' was a list of elements of everyday life in Bucharest at the time, composed as a comment on the contrast between the official view of life in Romania and the alternative perception of its monotonous shabbiness. The critical nature of the poem led to the edition of Amfiteatru being withdrawn within hours of publication with the editors being dismissed. Nevertheless, the poem appeared in translation in Western media and also had limited underground circulation in Romania. In 1987 she published at the Sport-Turism Publishing House the book \"Ora\u0219e de silabe\" (\"City of syllables\") where she writes about all the countries and cities of the world where she traveled in spite of the communist dictatorship: over 100. The same year, 1987, she is published in USSR, at Raduga Publishing House from Moscow, with the Russian title Stihotvorenia, rasskaz\u00ee, asse. Even though the secret services of Ceau\u0219escu ('Securitate') attribute her a dissident status, in 1989 the Minerva Publishing House is publishing in the most popular mass collection \"Biblioteca Pentru To\u021bi\" (\"Library for all people\") an anthology of her poems. Her friends sustain that the book never seen the bookshelves of the libraries. However, \"Poezii\" (\"Poems\") has a 'Foreword' written by Eugen Simion. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, she entered political life, campaigning for the removal of the communist legacy from administrative office, as well as for an open society. She left literary work in the background, although she did publish Arhitectura valurilor (\"Waves' Architecture\", 1990), 100 de poeme (\"100 Poems\", 1991), and Sertarul cu aplauze (\"The Drawer of Applause\", prose, 1992). In 1992 she advocates for the released from prison of old time Party member Gheorghe 'Gogu' Radulescu, a former member of the Executive Political Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and protector of herself during the communist period. Ana Blandiana has also published: 50 de poeme, (\"50 Poems\"), 1970: Octombrie, Noiembrie, Decembrie (\"October, November, December\"), 1972; \u00cent\u00e2mpl\u0103ri din gr\u0103dina mea (Occurrences in My Garden), 1980; Ora de nisip (\"The Hour of Sand\"), 1984; \u00cent\u00e2mpl\u0103ri de pe strada mea (Occurrences on My Street), 1988; \u00cen diminea\u021ba de dup\u0103 moarte (\"On the Morning After Dying\"), 1996; La cules \u00eengeri (\"Angel Gathering\"), 1997; Cartea alb\u0103 a lui Arpagic (\"Arpagic's White Book\"), 1998.
