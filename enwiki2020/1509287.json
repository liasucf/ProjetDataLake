She was built in 1988 by Brodosplit in Croatia, then Yugoslavia. Amorella has sister ships Gabriella in the Viking Line fleet, Isabelle operated by Tallink and a third one, Crown Seaways, operated by DFDS Seaways. ==History== In Turku Harbor before a voyage to Stockholm Amorella was ordered in 1986 by SF Line, one of the partners in Viking Line consortium. Although Brodosplit outbid other shipyards, the Finnish State offered to subsidise construction of the ship if she was built at a Finnish shipyard. This was a common practice in the 1980s to bring more jobs to Finland, but this time SF Line declined and had the ship built in Croatia. The original planned delivery date for Amorella was in March 1988, but due to delays in construction she was not completed until September, which meant SF Line was forced to operate the lucrative summer season with old tonnage. Except for short periods of time in 1997, 1998 and 2002, Amorella has always served on the Turku\u2013Mariehamn/L\u00e5ngn\u00e4s\u2013Stockholm route, making her the longest-lasting ship on that route. Originally she only called in Mariehamn during day crossing, but in July 1999 she had to start calling at the \u00c5land Islands in both directions to maintain tax free sales on board, and as a result a call at L\u00e5ngn\u00e4s was added to the night crossing. Like all ships, Amorella has suffered occasional misfortune. In 1993 the ship ran aground near Stockholm. She was able to come off by her own power, but her bottom was damaged in the process; she started taking in water and diesel oil leaked from a damaged fuel tank. The ship continued to Stockholm, and after unloading passengers and cargo she sailed to Turku Repair Yard, Naantali for repairs. Arriving at Mariehamn from Turku, 2019 In 1995, and again in 2001, there was a fire in one of the cabins but the ship's own firefighters managed to put it out. In May 2005 there was a fire in a car parked on the cardeck on Deck 5, but that too was put out by the ship's crew. In March 2010, the ship had to be rescued by ice breakers after becoming stranded in thick ice along with several other vessels. During this stranding, Amorella collided with the Finnlines ship Finnfellow which resulted in a large dent on the port side hull. Nobody was injured in the collision. On 14 December 2013, MS Amorella lost her steering due to a blackout and ran aground with about 2,000 passengers on board.Viking Amorella karilla \u2013 \"Jotkut ovat itkeneet\". Ilta- Sanomat, 14 December 2013. The only hull damage that occurred was a breach into a bow ballast tank. Therefore, no environmental damage occurred and there was no leak into the vessel. After being stuck for about twelve hours she was able continue her journey to Mariehamn under her own power. Ilta-Sanomat, 14 December 2013. On 20 September 2020, MS Amorella contacted the bottom with 207 and 74 crew aboard. The ship was intentionally run aground to stabilize the vessel. ==Future== Isabella, the sister ship which sailed in pair with Amorella, was replaced by Viking Line's newbuilding Viking Grace in January 2013. Viking Line had an option for a sister ship for the same route but announced in May 2012 that they have decided not to build it. Amorella will therefore continue her traffic as normal as Viking Line has not made any announcements regarding future plans for the ship. This wouldn\u00b4t be until January 2017 when Viking Line announced that they would sell Amorella in 2020 as there will be new ship at late Q1/early Q2 2020. ==References== ==External links== * * Amorella at Fakta om Fartyg * Viking Line official website Category:Ferries of Finland Category:Cruiseferries Category:Ships built in Yugoslavia Category:Ships built in Croatia Category:1987 ships ",
