    "text": "{| |} The Piaggio Stella P.VII was the first P series aircraft engine produced by Rinaldo Piaggio S.p.A.. Based on its experience license-producing the Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne 7K, Piaggio sold the engine to be used on a wide range of Italian aircraft before and during World War II, including the record-breaking Caproni Ca.133. ==Development== Having built engines under licence from Gnome et Rh\u00f4ne, Piaggio designed a seven-cylinder radial using the same principles. The engine, named P.VII for its seven cylinders, was one in a series of radial engines produced by Piaggio initially named Stella, meaning star. The engine was first run in 1933 and was produced in many models. One notable version was the P.VII Z which was fitted with a floatless Piaggio AS80 carburettor for aerobatic flight. It powered the Caproni Ca.133 flown by Renato Donati that, in 1933, broke the record for the longest duration in inverted flight. ==Variants== ;P.VII C.15: Supercharged, rated at at ; first flew 1933 ;P.VII C.16: Supercharged, rated at at ; first flew 1934 ;P.VII C.16/35: ;P.VII C.35: Supercharged, rated at at ; first flew 1935 ;P.VII C.40: Supercharged, rated at at ; first flew 1935 ;P.VII C.45 / 2v: Two speed supercharged, rated at at ; first flew 1935 ;P.VII R.C.10: Supercharged and geared, rated at . ;P.VII R.C.35: Supercharged and geared, rated at at ; first flew 1938 ;P.VII R.C.45: Supercharged and geared, rated at at first flew 1935 ;P.VII Z: Normally aspirated, designed for acrobatic aircraft, rated at , first flew 1933 ==Applications== * Breda Ba.28 * Caproni Ca.101 * Caproni Ca.113 * Caproni Ca.133 * Caproni Ca.148 * Caproni Ca.310 * Caproni Ca.311 * Caproni Ca.316 * Hispano HS-42 * IMAM Ro.41 * North American Sk.14A * Savoia-Marchetti S.71 * Savoia-Marchetti SM.85 ==Specifications (C.35)== ==See also== ==References== Category:1930s aircraft piston engines Category:Aircraft air-cooled radial piston engines P.VII ",
