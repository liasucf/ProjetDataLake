    "text": "Bank of China (; often abbreviated as \u4e2d\u884c or BOC) is one of the four biggest state-owned commercial banks in China. Bank of China is legally separate from its subsidiary Bank of China (Hong Kong), although they maintain close relations in management and administration and co-operate in several areas including reselling BOC's insurance and securities services. It was founded in 1912 by the Republican government to replace the Daqing Bank. It is the second oldest bank in mainland China still in existence (after the Bank of Communications, founded in 1908). From its establishment until 1942, it issued banknotes on behalf of the Government along with the \"Big Four\" banks of the period: the Farmers Bank of China, Bank of Communications and Central Bank of the Republic of China. Its headquarters are in Xicheng District, Beijing. As of 31 December 2009, it was the second-largest lender in China overall, and the fifth-largest bank in the world by market capitalization value. As of end 2017, it was the fourth-largest bank in the world in terms of assets, ranked after the other three Chinese banks. ==History== The Bank of China's history began in 1905, when the Qing government established Daqing Hubu BankThe term Hubu () referred to a central government ministry under the Qing imperial regime responsible for finances. () in Beijing, which was in 1908 renamed to Daqing Bank (). When the Republic of China was established in 1912, Chen Jintao was named head of financial reform in President Sun Yat-sen's government. Chen Jintao transformed the bank into the Bank of China, becoming its founder.\u4e2d\u56fd\u94f6\u884c\u7b80\u4ecb \uff0e\u4e2d\u56fd\u94f6\u884c\u5b98\u7f51\u5a92\u4f53\u89e3\u6790\u592e\u4f01\u201c\u4e00\u628a\u624b\u201d\u4efb\u547d\u4e0e\u9009\u62d4\u6a21\u5f0f \uff0e\u7f51\u6613\u65b0\u95fb1912\u5e742\u67085\u65e5 \u6c11\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u7b2c\u4e00\u94f6\u884c\uff1a\u4e2d\u56fd\u94f6\u884c\u5f00\u4e1a \uff0e\u641c\u72d0\u7f51\u4e2d\u56fd\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u540d\u5f55\uff1a\u4e2d\u56fd\u94f6\u884c \uff0e\u817e\u8baf\u8d22\u7ecf After the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949, the Bank of China effectively split into two operations. Part of the bank relocated to Taiwan with the Kuomintang (KMT) government, and was privatized in 1971 to become the International Commercial Bank of China (). In 2002, it merged with Jiaotong Bank () to become the Mega International Commercial Bank. The Mainland operation is the current entity known as the Bank of China. It is the second largest lender in China overall, and the fifth largest bank in the world by market capitalization value. Once 100% owned by the central government, via China Central Huijin and National Council for Social Security Fund (SSF), an Initial public offering (IPO) of its shares took place in June 2006, the free float is at present over 26%. In the Forbes Global 2000 it ranked as the 4th-largest company in the world. It is the most globally-active of China's banks, with branches on every inhabited continent. Outside of mainland China, BOC also operates in 27 countries and areas including Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Russia, Hungary, United States, Panama, Brazil, Japan, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Bahrain, Zambia, South Africa, and a branch office in the Cayman Islands. In December 2010, the Bank of China New York branch began offering renminbi products for Americans. It was the first major Chinese bank to offer such a product. Although it is present in the above countries/territories, its operations outside China accounted for less than 4% of the activity of the bank by both profits and assets. Mainland China accounts for 60% of the bank by profits and 76% by assets as at December 2005. ==Timeline of overseas activities== Tokyo branch 410 Madison Ave New York City Bank of China building in Singapore Bank of China (Canada) in Markham, Ontario Bank of China in Shenyang * 1917: BOC opened a branch in Hong Kong. * 1929: BOC opened its first overseas branch in London.
