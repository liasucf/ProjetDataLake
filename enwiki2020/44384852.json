His tone bending, for example, is done very subtly and with a knowingness that never announces the arrival of the next bended note. He plays it with a liquidity and fluid sense of phrasing that makes every piece a study in elegance\".Jenkins, W., JazzTimes Review, January/February 1998 ==Track listing== All compositions by C. I.
