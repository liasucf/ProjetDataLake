    "text": "Paul Steiner (born 23 January 1957) is a retired German footballer who played mainly as a central defender. ==Club career== Born in Waldbrunn, Baden- W\u00fcrttemberg, Steiner began playing football in his hometown with TSV Str\u00fcmpfelbrunn. He started his professional career in 1975, going on to spend four seasons in the second division with SV Waldhof Mannheim. Steiner appeared in 349 games in the Bundesliga, scoring 27 times from 1979 until 1991 with MSV Duisburg and 1. FC K\u00f6ln. With the latter side, he was instrumental in five league finishes in the top three, also winning the German Cup in 1983 and losing the 1985\u201386 UEFA Cup to Real Madrid. After retiring at 34, Steiner later worked as a scout for K\u00f6ln's Rhine rival, Bayer 04 Leverkusen, before taking up the same role back at the former club. ==International career== Steiner was one of the oldest debutants in the German national team, when he appeared as a 33-year-old substitute in the final friendly match ahead of the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy, against Denmark at Gelsenkirchen's Parkstadion on 30 May. He was surprisingly selected for the World Cup squad in favour of Bayer Uerdingen's Holger Fach, who had been the expected pick of coach Franz Beckenbauer as Klaus Augenthaler's understudy. Steiner was not recalled again after the tournament, where Germany defeated Argentina in the final and he didn't play a single minute. ==Personal life== Steiner was commonly quoted in Germany as stating in a talk show that homosexuals were \"too soft\" for playing football. ==References== ==External links== * * * * Germany stats at Eu- Football Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:German footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Bundesliga players Category:2.
