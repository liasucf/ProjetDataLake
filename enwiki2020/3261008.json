Brunsdale, Encyclopedia of Nordic Crime Fiction: Works and Authors of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden since 1967 (Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2016), 212. He has been called 'Iceland's foremost contemporary author, in the estimation of many'.'a\u00f0 margra mati einn helsti samt\u00edmah\u00f6fundur \u00cdslands': \u00dalfhildur Dagsd\u00f3ttir, 'Hryllilegar hremmingar \u00e1 h\u00e1lendinu', T\u00edmarit M\u00e1ls og menningar, 2012 issue 4, 112-17 (at p. 112). ==Career== At the age of 23 he published his first book of poetry, Svarthol, and his first novel, Turninn ('the tower'), was published in 2000. He studied comparative literature and philosophy at the University of Iceland. In 2008, his book Konur ('Women') received great critical and commercial success and was nominated for the Nordic Council literature prize. Current affairs, particularly the 2008\u201311 Icelandic financial crisis, are prominent in his work from 2008 onwards, such as Konur and H\u00e1lendi\u00f0: Sk\u00e1ldsaga.\u00dalfhildur Dagsd\u00f3ttir, 'Hryllilegar hremmingar \u00e1 h\u00e1lendinu', T\u00edmarit M\u00e1ls og menningar, 2012 issue 4, 112-17 (at p. 112). Steinar Bragi is sometimes considered to be in the \"new wave\" of younger Icelandic authors influenced by popular culture and in his case the grotesque, with influences from horror writers such as H. P. Lovecraft.\u00dalfhildur Dagsd\u00f3ttir, 'Hryllilegar hremmingar \u00e1 h\u00e1lendinu', T\u00edmarit M\u00e1ls og menningar, 2012 issue 4, 112-17. He is also notable as a poet. Most of Steinar Bragi's early writing was published by the Icelandic publishing house Bjartur. In 2008, however, he changed to M\u00e1l og menning.'[www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/1252473/ Steinar Bragi farinn fr\u00e1 Bjarti]', Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0 (31 October 2008).
