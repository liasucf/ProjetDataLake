    "text": "\u00c4ggakaka served at a restaurant. \u00c4ggakaka (English: Egg cake) is a traditional Scanian dish that is similar to kolbullen or oven pancake (ugnspankaka), that is served with fried slices of pork belly and lingon berries. It used to be made for farmworkers as it was easy to wrap up and eat out on the fields. == Preparation == When making \u00e4ggakaka a batter similar to pancakes is prepared, but with more eggs and flour to make a creamier consistency. It is also common that grounded black pepper is added to the batter. For frying; either the fat left over from the pork mixed with butter is used, or just plain butter. When frying with just plain butter, the melted butter is later poured over the finished \u00e4ggakaka as it contains a rich pork flavor. During cooking enough batter needs to be poured into the pan to create a thickness of at least 5 centimeters. To prevent burning of the \u00e4ggakaka's underside the batter needs to be lifted continuously until it get a firm but creamy consistency. When the batter have almost solidified it is time to turn the cake around. A big lid is put on the pan, which is then turned upside-down, after which a new knob of butter is put in the pan. When the new butter have melted, you let the \u00e4ggakaka carefully slide down from the lid onto the pan again with the uncooked side downwards. When the surface have become golden brown the \u00e4ggakaka is finished. Unlike kolbullen, \u00e4ggakaka is made with rich amounts of eggs, thereof the name, and is fried in rich amounts of butter. \u00c4ggakaka is also not coupled with poor access to ingredients or kitchen equipment. According to some recipes the \u00e4ggakaka need to be baked in an oven, but then it becomes more similar to an oven pancake and lose its characteristic butter fried surface. == Serving == \u00c4ggakaka is always served with fried smoked pork. The fried pork is sometimes sliced or diced into the batter before cooking the \u00e4ggakaka. However, this causes the pork flavor to become weak. It is therefore more common to fry the pork separately, and then add it on top the finished \u00e4ggakaka together with its melted fat. Lingonberry jam is a common condiment to \u00e4ggakaka. This is however a newer tradition as there is only a limited amount of lingonberries in the Scanian nature. A more common condiment in the older days used to be apple sauce or butter fried apple slices. == References == Category:Swedish cuisine ",
