He was chosen by ESPN to direct the documentary because of his father's co-founding of the league, and he used the longtime friendship between Dick and WWE chairman Vince McMahon as the centerpiece for the film. == Alliance of American Football == In March 2018, Ebersol announced the creation of a new professional football league called the Alliance of American Football. The announcement was made at a press event at the Park Hyatt in Manhattan, and was streamed live on Facebook. Ebersol co- founded the league, which started playing in 2019, with former NFL executive and Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Bill Polian. Ebersol's father, who co- founded rival league XFL and who led NBC Sports and created Sunday Night Football, sat on the league's board. The league was backed by investors such as Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, The Chernin Group and former NFL player Jared Allen, and employed coaches Mike Singletary, Brad Childress and Steve Spurrier as well as former NFL players including Justin Tuck, Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu who held executive roles. Games were played during the \"off-season,\" from February to April, and aired on CBS, CBS Sports Network, NFL Network, TNT, B/R Live and the league's mobile app. After giving unilateral control of the league to Thomas Dundon, (owner of the Carolina Hurricanes NHL franchise) the league was suspended against the wishes of Ebersol and Polian. Ebersol consistently showed signs of dishonesty and evasiveness whenever pressed on the league's financial matters. In 2019, he was listed among the 40 Under 40 List put out by Connecticut Magazine. \"40 Under 40: The Class of 2019.\" (Connecticut Magazine) (January 23, 2019) Retrieved March 5, 2019. ==Philanthropy== For his 30th birthday, Ebersol held a party entitled \"Charlieland\" benefiting Charity: Water, raising nearly $60,000 for the charity.\u201cCharlieLAND\u201d, \"Charity: Water\u201d, December 31, 2012 In 2014, Ebersol and The Company became entertainment partners of the veteran campaign Got Your 6 together with First Lady Michelle Obama and actor Bradley Cooper.Andrea Seikaly \u201cBizzers Meet to Discuss Media\u2019s Portrayal of Veterans\u201d, \"Variety\", May 29, 2014Jeff Nelson \u201cMeet Britney Spears's New Beau: 5 Things to Know About Charlie Ebersol\u201d, \"People\", November 6, 2014 ==Personal life== On March 17, 2017, Ebersol announced via Twitter his engagement to Melody McCloskey, Founder and CEO of StyleSeat.
