In November, the Regional Government of Northwest Russia was formed. The force was later renamed the Northern Corps. After December 1918, following an agreement with Estonia, the army was put under Estonian control. In May 1919, the Northwestern Army was formed by general Nikolai Yudenich, one of the most successful Russian commanders of World War I. In October, under the command of Yudenich, he commanded the assault on Petrograd, capturing Tsarskoye Selo, but was defeated and driven back to Estonia. The government was dissolved and the army interned by the Estonians on 5 December 1919.\"Russian Civil War Polities\", World Statesmen.org ==References== Category:White movement Category:Counter-revolutionaries Category:1918 establishments in Russia Category:1919 disestablishments in Russia Category:Provisional governments of the Russian Civil War ",
