Eventually, Alden proposes to \"Jerry\", still not knowing her true identity, and the two become engaged.

Stedmn recognizes him, after which Johnson tries to rile the occupants of the house to attack Brophy.

They called it one of the \"more and worse\" films of the year. They found fault with the production, stating that \"It was tiresome, slow, confusing, unreal, uninteresting -- and about everything else uncomplimentary that could be said.\" They did, however, give one exemption, finding the work of Emmy Wehlen of note. ==Notes== This was the final film of S. Rankin Drew, who left to join the Franco-American Air Corps after production on the film wrapped. Its release was posthumous, as Rankin was killed in action in the spring of 1918. ==References== == External links == * * * Category:Films directed by S.
