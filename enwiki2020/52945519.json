Colin William Scott-Moncrieff and Constance Elizabeth Hannah Lunn. He was a nephew of the famous translator C. K. Scott Moncrieff. His elder brother, Colin Herbert (8 November 1908 \u2013 November 1941), was killed in action in Libya. He was educated at Edinburgh Academy and Aldenham School in Hertfordshire, England. ==Career== Scott-Moncrieff's first novel Caf\u00e9 Bar was published in 1932. He married his first wife Ann Shearer in 1936, having met her in London where they both worked as journalists. Under her influence he converted from Episcopalianism to Catholicism. He lived with his first wife in Breakacky near Kingussie, then Dalwhinnie, and finally Edinburgh. After her death at the age of 29, he moved to the Isle of Eigg in 1945 and lived there a hermit-like existence in a simple cottage for about five years. His novel Death's Bright Shadow (1948) is a fictional account of his grief. He moved back to Edinburgh in 1951 and eventually married Eileen n\u00e9e Ward, only daughter of the American illustrator Keith Ward. Upon his death he was survived by Eileen and seven children from the two marriages. The defence of tradition runs through all of Scott- Moncrieff's writings \u2013 his books about Scottish architecture and Scottish religions, his plays, his novels, his poems, his short history of the Catholic faith in Scotland, his many book reviews, his moving little volume of religious meditations. He coined the term \"Balmorality\" to describe the cultural manifestations of Scotland's accommodation with the British Empire.Scott-Moncrieff, George (1932), Balmorality, in Thomson, David Cleghorn (Ed.) (1932), Scotland in Quest of Her Youth, Oliver & Boyd, pp. 69 \u2013 86 In 1951, he wrote Living Traditions of Scotland, a booklet published on behalf of the Council of Industrial Design Scottish Committee to accompany the Living Traditions exhibition of architecture and crafts held in Edinburgh as part of the Festival of Britain.Scott-Moncrieff, George (1951), Living Traditions of Scotland, His Majesty's Stationery Office, Edinburgh He died in Peeblesshire and is buried in Traquair Churchyard. ==Selected publications== * * * 15 editions published between 1939 and 1983 * * 42 editions published between 1947 and 1967 * * * * * * 13 editions published between 1960 and 1961 * * * * s.d., 25th ed. *as editor: ** ** 11 editions published between 1938 and 1983 ** ==References== Category:1910 births Category:1974 deaths Category:People educated at Aldenham School Category:People educated at Edinburgh Academy Category:Scottish journalists Category:Scottish novelists Category:Scottish Renaissance ",
