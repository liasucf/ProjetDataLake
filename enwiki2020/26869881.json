    "text": "{| |} MS Polaris is a Russian-owned, Danish-built passenger ship currently in service with the Murmansk Shipping Company and based in Murmansk. It was built in 1968, and until 2000, it served as a ferry between cities in Greenland, mainly passenger transfers along the Greenland coastline before transferring to the Bahamas, then Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, presumably as a tourist ship. Finally, it moved to Russia where it is based today. It holds 80 passengers and is equipped with a lounge with bar, as well as a library, covered deck, outside deck and a gift shop. It was renovated at Tallinn, Estonia in 2005 and now offers cruises in the Barents Sea and transfers from Murmansk to St. Petersburg, Archangelsk, the Solovets Islands and is also the only ship that stops at Vaygach Island. It was surveyed in Murmansk on 27 February 2010 and found to be in good condition. ==References== ==External links== *Det Norske Veritas *Russian Maritime Register *Great Canadian Travel Company *MS Polaris Category:1968 ships Category:Passenger ships of Russia ",
