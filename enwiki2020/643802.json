He was killed in Marseille, France, on February 21, 1995. He was walking with a group of ten other young men in Marseilles' XVth arrondissement when they encountered three supporters of Jean-Marie Le Pen's Front National party, armed with guns, who had been posting campaign signs nearby. The latter group opened fire on them, and Ibrahim Ali was shot in the back. == Reactions == Jean-Marie Le Pen initially responded to the murder, saying \"at least this unfortunate incident has brought to everyone's attention the presence in Marseille of 50,000 Comorians. What are they doing here?\" However, following another murder of immigrants by members of the National Front, Le Pen stated, \"The people who did this are criminals and should be arrested by the police.\" Bruno M\u00e9gret declared, \"the blame is on massive and uncontrolled immigration... if our billstickers hadn't been armed, they would have probably been dead.\"Le M\u00e9ridional, February 23, 1995 == References == Category:Anti-Muslim violence in Europe Category:1995 crimes in France Category:1995 deaths Category:Comorian people murdered abroad Category:Crime in Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur Category:Deaths by firearm in France Category:French murder victims Category:Comorian murder victims Category:Marseille Category:Murder in France Category:Murdered French children Category:National Front (France) Category:People murdered in France Ali Ibrahim Category:1990s murders in France Category:1995 murders in Europe ",
