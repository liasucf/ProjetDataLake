    "text": "The United States Intercollegiate Boxing Association (USIBA) is a nonprofit amateur collegiate boxing league founded in 2012 and formed, in part, to address perceived safety and fairness issues present in the National Collegiate Boxing Association (such as matching up boxers with significant skill or experience disparities), and to generally organize the sport at a collegiate level more adequately. The USIBA was also the first organization to hold national collegiate-level women's boxing championships in the United States (the subject of which had been another point of contention with the NCBA), beginning with their inaugural national tournament in 2013. The association is an affiliate of USA Boxing. ==Participating schools == Current schools: * Alverno College * Cornell University * Georgetown University * Georgia State University * Georgia Tech * Kansas University * Olivet College * Syracuse University * Texas A&M; University * Towson University * UC Davis * University of Illinois * University of Maryland * University of Miami * University of Michigan * University of San Francisco * University of Wisconsin * Virginia Military Institute * Wake Forest University * Western State Colorado University Former schools: * UCLA (joined the NCBA after the 2015 season) * United States Military Academy (women's team only; joined the NCBA after the 2015 season) ==Weight Classes == The USIBA closely follows the weight classes prescribed by USA Boxing, though does not name the classes, instead referring to them only by the weight itself. Not all weight classes are necessarily contested at each national tournament. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !! colspan=\"2\" |Weight class limit (lbs/kg) |- !style=\"width:30%\"| Men !!style=\"width:30%\"| Women |- || \u2014 || |- || || - |- || || |- || || - |- || || |- || || |- || || |- || || |- || || |- || || |- || || |- || \u2014 || 178+ lbs |- | || \u2014 |- | || \u2014 |- | || \u2014 |- | 225+ lbs || \u2014 |- |} ==National Tournament== In the national tournament, boxers are divided into three classes: Beginner (0-2 sanctioned bouts), Novice (0-9 bouts), and Elite (5+ bouts), as per USA Boxing rules. The experience division plays into the final team scoring system, in which more experienced boxers earn more points for their team. This structure also allows for the possibility of, for example, a boxer winning a Beginner championship and then competing for a Novice title later in the tournament, usually on the final day. ===Team scoring=== Quarterfinal wins: * Beginners earn 1 point for their team * Novices earn 2 points for their team * Elites earn 3 points for their team Semifinal wins: * Beginners earn 2 point for their team * Novices earn 3 points for their team * Elites earn 4 points for their team Championship wins: * Beginners earn 3 point for their team * Novices earn 4 points for their team * Elites earn 5 points for their team ==National Team Champions== Champions are as follows: {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\" align=\"left\" |Year |Host |Men |Women |Notes |- |2013 |University of San Francisco |UC Davis |U.S. Military Academy |Army also won the very first individual national collegiate women's boxing title. |- |2014 |University of Miami |Michigan |U.S. Military Academy |- |2015 |University of Michigan |Virginia Military Institute |Michigan |Final USIBA appearances of the UCLA and USMA women's teams before joining the NCBA |- |2016 |California State University, Northridge |Olivet College |Michigan |- |2017 |Virginia Military Institute |Michigan |Michigan |First tournament sweep by a single school |- |2018 |University of Illinois |Illinois |Michigan |- |2019 |Syracuse University |Illinois |Georgetown |- |2020 |colspan=3 align=center|No tournament held |Cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
