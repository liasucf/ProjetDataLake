The station is elevated over Sepulveda Boulevard with a single center platform. A new two story parking structure was also built to the south of the station. The Final Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for Expo Phase 2 designated this station as at-grade. However, the report also included a design option for an elevated station should the additional funds become available. The $5.3 million cost difference was ultimately allocated by the Los Angeles City Council on 18 March 2011 and the elevated option was approved by the Expo Board on the same day.http://www.buildexpo.org/pdf_uploads/boar_r7n9a740d.pdf A concrete processing plant located just north of the station site, on the west side of Sepulveda between Exposition and Pico Boulevards, was purchased by Casden Properties, who plans to build a large mixed-use transit development on the site, including 538 apartments and a Target store ==History== Streetcar Depot at end of the former branch line from this station, located on the Sawtelle Veterans Home grounds. Originally \"Vervain\" station, it was renamed \"Home Junction\" when it became the junction point with the Soldier's Home Branch, a route heading north along the west side of Sepulveda Boulevard to the Streetcar Depot building on the Sawtelle Veterans Home grounds.
