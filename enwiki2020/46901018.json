It originally aired in 1992 on Canal 13 and was a commercial success. ==Background== Antonella was written by Enrique Torres and based on an idea by Torres and F. L. Lucas. It combined melodrama typical of traditional telenovelas with elements of comedy. In this series, Andrea del Boca, who at that time was at the height of her career, portrayed a charismatic heroine, very different from the ones she had played in previous telenovelas. She also contributed the theme song \"Para este amor\". The series was very successful and became one of the most watched programs of 1992 in Argentina. It was nominated to the Mart\u00edn Fierro Award for the Best Telenovela and won the Best Supporting Actor and the Best Supporting Actress for Osvaldo Guidi and Hilda Bernard, respectively. Antonella eventually won the Best Telenovela award at the 1993 Mart\u00edn Fierro Awards. The series was also distributed abroad and found popularity in Italy and Eastern Europe in the mid-1990s. ==Plot== Antonella is a cheerful young woman working as a clown at children's parties. She lives with her friend Carlo whom she treats as father. During one of her outdoor performances for children she is approached by Nicol\u00e1s and his son Federico. Nicol\u00e1s is attracted to Antonella and invites her on a dinner date. It soon turns out that he is the boss of her sister Natalia who works as his secretary, and that they are having an affair. When Antonella walks in on them, in anger slaps the man in the face. Nicol\u00e1s is the head of a family company and entrusts Natalia some very confidential documents. His cousin Gast\u00f3n is envious of his success and fiercely hates him. He orders two men to follow Natalia and seize the documents which he wants to use against Nicol\u00e1s and to potentially take over his position. They do not realize that the woman, sensing danger, has just handed the documents to Antonella. Having entered her flat, but not able to get hold of the documents, they decide to kill Natalia by throwing her through the window, fabricating a suicide. Antonella does not believe that her sister killed herself and suspects that Nicol\u00e1s was involved in this. Using blackmail, she ends up in his family residence working as a secretary, in the meantime conducting her own investigation and trying to unravel the mystery behind Natalia's death. There, she meets Gast\u00f3n and other members of the Cornejo Mej\u00eda family: Lucrecia, their grandmother and the main owner of the company, Facundo, Nicol\u00e1s' father, Raquel, Gast\u00f3n's wife, and Paula, Lucrecia's illegitimate daughter. Antonella and Nicol\u00e1s end up falling in love, which infuriates Miranda who also loves him and starts plotting intrigues against Antonella. ==Cast== * Andrea del Boca \u2013 Antonella * Gustavo Berm\u00fadez \u2013 Nicol\u00e1s Cornejo Mej\u00eda * Luis Luque \u2013 Gast\u00f3n Cornejo Mej\u00eda * Hilda Bernard \u2013 Lucrecia Cornejo Mej\u00eda * Jorge D'El\u00eda \u2013 Carlo Moricone * Virginia Innocenti \u2013 Miranda * Humberto Serrano \u2013 Facundo Cornejo Mej\u00eda * Mim\u00ed Ard\u00fa \u2013 Raquel * Osvaldo Tesser \u2013 Abelardo * M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n \u2013 Paula * Osvaldo Guidi \u2013 Arturo * Gast\u00f3n Martelli \u2013 Lorenzo * Diego Bozzolo \u2013 Federico * Vita Escard\u00f3 \u2013 Natalia ==References== ==External links== * Category:1992 Argentine television series debuts Category:1992 Argentine television series endings Category:1992 telenovelas Category:Argentine telenovelas Category:El Trece telenovelas Category:Spanish- language telenovelas ",
