She is currently the third on the German National Women's Curling Team skipped by Daniela Jentsch. ==Career== Abbes was a member of the German team at the 2017 Winter Universiade, playing second on a team skipped by Maike Beer. The team finished in eighth. Abbes became the alternate on the German national women's team (skipped by Daniela Jentsch) in 2017. As the team's alternate, she played in the 2017 World Women's Curling Championship. The team was sitting at 5\u20134 with two games left. The Germans had a chance to qualify for the playoffs. Unfortunately, they would lose their last two games to Scotland and Czech Republic, ending their chance to reach the playoffs. That season, the German team was met with disappointment. They tried to qualify for the Olympic Games, at the 2018 Winter Olympic qualification event, but they finished with a record of 2\u20134, missing the playoffs. The next season, the team qualified for the Worlds after going 3\u20136 at the Euros. But the team struggled at the World Championship, finishing in twelfth with a 3\u20139 record. The following season, the German team would have success at the Europeans. The team reached the playoffs at Abbes first European Curling Championships with a 5\u20134 record. In the semifinal, they lost to the Swiss team Silvana Tirinzoni 6\u20134. In the bronze medal game though, the Germans turned things around. The team would win the game 7\u20134, winning them the bronze medal. It was her first medal at an international competition. Abbes also won her second tour event this season. Two months after the Europeans, the team won the Qinghai Curling Elite. At the Worlds, her team of Daniela Jentsch, Klara-Hermine Fomm and Analena Jentsch were sitting at 4\u20136 after their tenth game with two still to go. The team had another chance to clinch a playoff spot. But once again they lost their next game eliminating them from contention. The team did have a good final game though, beating eventual winners Switzerland 10\u20138 after scoring four in the last end. Team Jentsch's first event of the 2019\u201320 season was at the 2019 Cargill Curling Training Centre Icebreaker where they lost in the quarterfinals. They also had playoff appearances at the 2019 Cameron's Brewing Oakville Fall Classic and the Prestige Hotels & Resorts Curling Classic making the semifinals in both events. The German team also qualified for their first Grand Slam of Curling event, the 2019 Tour Challenge Tier 2 where they went 1\u20133, missing the playoffs. At the 2019 European Curling Championships, the team did not qualify for the playoffs like in 2018, finishing the round-robin in fifth place with a 5\u20134 record. The team was set to represent Germany at the 2020 World Women's Curling Championship before the event got cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Personal life== As of 2020, Abbes is employed as a sports soldier. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:1996 births Category:German female curlers Category:People from F\u00fcssen ",
