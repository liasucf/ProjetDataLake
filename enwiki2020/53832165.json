The Five Minute Festival had three rules: submissions must be less than five minutes in length, they must have a narrative thread, and at least either the writer, director or cast must be under 27 years old. The pieces could cover a wide range of areas including: dance, theatre, spoken word, poetry, physical theatre, ensemble work, and devised work. The winners received a cash prize. The theatre also supported new writers from the festival with space and supported bursaries to create a new full length piece of work. Throughout the year, several acting and dance teachers conducted classes in the rehearsal studios each week. == References == ==External links== http://www.stockwellph.com/ Category:Theatres in the London Borough of Lambeth ",
