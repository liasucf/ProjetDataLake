The term may also refer to a network of tunnels that connects buildings beneath street level that may house office blocks, shopping malls, metro stations, theatres, and other attractions. These passages can usually be accessed through the public space of any of the buildings connecting to them, and sometimes have separate entries as well. This latter definition encompasses many modern structures, whereas the former more generally covers tunnel systems from ancient times to the present day. Underground cities are especially functional in cities with very cold or hot climates, because they permit activities to be comfortably accessible year round without regard to the weather. Underground cities are similar in nature to skyway systems and may include some buildings linked by skyways or above-ground corridors rather than underground. Some cities also have tunnels that have been abandoned. ==Argentina== Buenos Aires, capital of Argentina, has an extensive amount of underground cities in its Subte. Most stations have small shops, bars and kiosks, while main hubs interconnect through underground pedestrian walkways with railroad stations, governmental buildings, or shopping centres. Some have additional mall-like mezzanine levels, with the Centro Obelisk of Buenos Aires area (3 lines, 4 underground levels), Estaci\u00f3n Retiro, Estaci\u00f3n Constituci\u00f3n, Estaci\u00f3n Once, and Federico Lacroze railway station being the most important ones. ==Australia== Sydney has a series of underground shopping malls around the Town Hall underground station.

The linked centres run for over .

Perth has a small network of underground shopping malls running from the St Georges Terrace entrance to Trinity Arcade to Murray Street Mall.

The city also has an underground concourse at the Place de Ville office complex in the downtown business district, connecting 4 office buildings containing over of leasable space, and 2 hotels with 900 rooms combined. There are plans to expand the underground network after the Confederation Line, a rapid transit line featuring three downtown subway stations, is completed.

Also the University of Manitoba has tunnels for the students to travel from building to building. *Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island has a tiny system. A pedestrian tunnel connects the Confederation Center of the Arts with the Confederation Court Mall. The mall also connects to The Holman Grand Hotel.

A series of tunnels also connect the Hennepin County Government Center, Minneapolis City Hall, and the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. *New York City, New York: Several New York City Subway stations have direct access to one or more buildings. Additionally, most of the lower floor of the Rockefeller Center qualifies as an underground city, as it features connections to subways, an extensive underground concourse, building connections, and several restaurants, all below ground. The area around Times Square and the Port Authority Bus Terminal forms an underground network several blocks in size; much of it is within the Subway's fare control. *Oklahoma City, Oklahoma: The Oklahoma City Underground (formerly the Oklahoma City Conncourse) is a tunnel system connecting nearly all of the downtown buildings in a 20-square-block area. It is one of the most extensive all-enclosed pedestrian systems in the U.S., extending three-quarters of a mile and connecting over 30 downtown buildings via tunnels or skyways. The original tunnel link was built in 1931 and the system was extended in the 1970s. It underwent a $2 million renovation in 2006\u20132007, after which the Conncourse was renamed the Underground. *Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Center City has several miles of interconnected underground concourses under Market, Broad, and Locust Streets, and JFK Boulevard. The system includes nine rapid transit and regional rail stations served by 23 SEPTA and PATCO lines, and the lower levels of several shopping centers. It is also connected to the lower levels of many office buildings and several department stores and hotels, as well as the customer service counters of the Municipal Services Building. A branch of the US Post Office is located in the Suburban Station section of the concourse. *Richmond, Virginia: There are a series of connected tunnels between state government buildings in the city of Richmond. Certain passageways are locked off but a good portion of the tunnels are accessible from buildings. The purpose of the tunnels is not generally known; the two most common explanations are that they were built to allow people to move between buildings in inclement weather or that they were built as part of an emergency evacuation plan. *Rochester, Minnesota: The Mayo Clinic's buildings in the downtown area are interconnected with tunnels and skyways. Other businesses are along the corridors, including a number of hotels that often house clinic patients. It is often called a subway, although there are no underground rails in the city. *Rochester, New York: Nazareth College in the southeast portion of Rochester has an extensive underground network of tunnels leading from the dormitories to the major buildings on campus. Rochester Institute of Technology has several underground networks connecting dormitories and academic buildings together. The University of Rochester has an underground network connecting many of its academic buildings. *Seattle, Washington: Several modern undergrounds and a historical tour exist. The Westlake Center shopping mall and its surrounding department stores have underground entrances to the mezzanine level of the Westlake light rail station in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel. Another substantial corridor extends from Two Union Square to Rainier Square, with connections to hotels, the 5th Avenue Theatre, and many retail shops along the way. The Seattle Underground Tour in Pioneer Square takes visitors on a humorous guided walk showing the original ground level of many buildings in that area. *Shirley's White House Vicksburg in 1863Vicksburg, Mississippi: During the Siege of Vicksburg in 1863, Union gunboats lobbed over 22,000 shells into the town, destroying nearly all of the town's housing. As a result, over 500 caves were dug into the clay hills surrounding Vicksburg. The Union soldiers later gave the town the nickname of \"Prairie Dog Village\" due to these caves. *Walt Disney World, Florida (southwest of Orlando, Florida) has a network of utility tunnels used by its employees for transportation between venues, rest areas, staff preparation, and first aid. The main system is under the Magic Kingdom theme park. Other tunnels lie underneath Future World at Epcot. *Washington D.C.: All of the buildings in the United States Capitol Complex are connected by tunnels and underground walkways, which provide easy passage between legislative office buildings, the Capitol, the Capitol Visitor Center, and the Library of Congress in inclement weather. The tunnels connecting office buildings are open to the public, but those connecting to the Capitol require security clearance to use. Small electric tramways run from the Capitol building to the Russell, Dirksen, and Hart Senate Office Buildings and to the Rayburn House Office Building. The tunnel between the Capitol and the Cannon House Office Building displays winning pieces of artwork from the annual Congressional Art Competition for high school students. *Wellesley, Massachusetts: There is an underground network connecting several buildings at Wellesley College. ==See also== Other parent categories from the same field: *Rock-cut architecture *Subterranea (geography): underground structures *Underground living *Underground construction Types of underground spaces and people, and related topics: *Ant tribe \u2013 Chinese sociology term *Arcology \u2013 ecological architecture term *Catacombs *Cities of the Underworld documentary television series *Mole people \u2013 homeless tunnel dwellers *Pedway \u2013 elevated or underground walkways *Rapid transit (subway) *Secret passage **Tunnels in popular culture *Skyway *Utility tunnel ==References== Category:Pedestrian infrastructure Category:Urban exploration ",
