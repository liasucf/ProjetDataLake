Prior to its closure, the airline flew from Tallinn to 11 destinations in Europe. From 1991 to 1996 and since 2010 Estonian Air was owned by the Estonian government. In 2010 the Estonian government had purchased the company back from SAS Group to ensure it did not go bankrupt. On 7 November 2015 the European Commission ruled that the government funding given to the company had been in breach of the European Union regulations and must be paid back. Estonian Air, not having such funds, ceased all its operations the next day and immediately entered the process of liquidation. A new state-owned airline, Nordica, entered operations the same day. == History == A former Estonian Air Yakovlev Yak-40 in 1994 A former Estonian Air Fokker 50 in 2002 ===Early years=== The airline was established by the Estonian government with aircraft acquired from the defunct local Aeroflot Division. In 1992, the airline became a member of IATA and the first Boeing 737-500 was delivered in 1995. The company was partially privatised in 1996 with 66% of shares to Maersk Air (49%) and Cresco investment bank (17%).Flight International 3 April 2007 The company leased two Boeing 737-500s to replace its old Soviet planes, and in 1996, after obtaining two more Fokker 50s, it was able to retire the Soviet fleet entirely. In 2003, Maersk Air sold its shares to SAS and the Fokker 50s were retired. By 2004 the airline had carried its 500,000th passenger. Estonian Air pilots in 2007 In March 2007, Estonian Air announced that they will lease another Boeing 737-500 and serve a new destination, Vienna. Estonian Air has leased two Saab 340s and in June 2008 Estonian Air established a new company, Estonian Air Regional. Under that name, it added new destinations from Tallinn to Kuressaare, Stockholm, Helsinki and Vilnius. Later on to Saint Petersburg and to Minsk. In 2008, three new destinations (Minsk, Munich and Rome) were served and the company announced that it was ordering three Bombardier CRJ900 NG and further 3 options. On 27 November 2008, Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip announced that SAS had approached the Estonian government, urgently requesting a cash injection to save the airline and offering to buy out the government's stake in the airline. The Estonian government is reportedly in negotiations with ferry company Tallink to come up with a counter-proposal. In 2009, Estonian Air gave up its Vienna, Frankfurt and Simferopol routes. The company closed its ground handling division. New destinations from Tallinn were Amsterdam, Berlin and St Peterburg, new route was Tartu\u2013Stockholm. ===Development since 2010=== In 2010, Estonian Air started cooperation with KLM, announcing the new Tallinn\u2013Vilnius\u2013Amsterdam route (starting from 12 February 2010).

As of 10 May 2010, the government of Estonia and SAS Scandinavian Airlines have agreed to a transaction where the Estonian government provides an additional 21 million EUR in capital to Estonian Air resulting in the stake of SAS in the carrier to decrease from 49% to 10%. At the same time, the two parties have agreed that the Estonian government gets an option to buy the remaining 10% stake from SAS at a later time between then and 2014. Estonian Air and SAS Scandinavian Airlines will continue to cooperate in the same fashion for the time being. The short-term aim of the government is to become a leading shareholder and to invest in the company to ensure its future, as Estonian Air is strategically important to the state. In September 2010, Estonian Air announced that they have finally signed an agreement with Bombardier, in which two CRJ-900 NextGen aircraft are going to be delivered in the beginning of 2011 (both planes were delivered in January 2011) and a third one in 2012.Estonian CRJ900s to arrive in 2011 under new dea.

In November 2011, Minister of Economic Affairs Juhan Parts proposed that SAS should follow the state's lead in making substantial investments in Estonian Air. SAS Vice- President Sture Stolen however said that this is unlikely: \"We have a good and important partnership with them, but it is not our strategy to be part owners in Baltic airlines\". Estonian Air's new CEO and former AirBaltic chief commercial officer Tero Taskila expected the company to be profitable by 2012 after losing money since 2005. According to Taskila, the company already took a big step late in 2011 by clearing up its messy leadership issues. After further poor financial results in 2012, the government of Estonia decided to fire CEO Tero Taskila. From 1 November 2012, the new CEO was Jan Palm\u00e9r, who has had over 20 years of experience with different airlines in Scandinavia. ===Cessation of operations=== On 8 November 2015, Estonian Air ceased all operations after the European Commission declared the government funding received by the airline illegal which would have forced them to pay back over \u20ac85 million.http://www.aero.de/news-22842/Estonian-Air-stellt-Betrieb-nach-EU- Beihilfeentscheid-ein.html Replacement services on key Estonian Air routes have been established on short notice by the government-supported joint venture Nordic Aviation Group (NAG) under leadership of Adria Airways in joint operations with several European regional carriers.nagroup.ee - About Nordic Aviation Group retrieved 9 November 2015 == Destinations == Estonian Air offered direct flights from Tallinn to Amsterdam, Berlin (summer only), Brussels, Copenhagen, Kiev, London, Moscow, Nice (summer only), Oslo, Paris (summer only), St. Petersburg, Stockholm, Trondheim, Vienna and Vilnius.
