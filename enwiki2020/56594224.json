He went on to achieve a second number-one hit with \"Travellin' Light\". English instrumental pianist Russ Conway (pictured in 1962) had six top 10 entries this year, including the number-one hits \"Side Saddle\" and \"Roulette\". American singer Bobby Darin achieved two UK number-ones with his two top 10 entries of 1959: \"Dream Lover\" and \"Mack the Knife\". The UK Singles Chart is one of many music charts compiled by the Official Charts Company that calculates the best-selling singles of the week in the United Kingdom. Before 2004, the chart was only based on the sales of physical singles. This list shows singles that peaked in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart during 1959, as well as singles which peaked in 1958 and 1960 but were in the top 10 in 1959. The entry date is when the single appeared in the top 10 for the first time (week ending, as published by the Official Charts Company, which is six days after the chart is announced). Eighty singles were in the top ten in 1959. Eight singles from 1958 remained in the top 10 for several weeks at the beginning of the year, while \"Little White Bull\" by Tommy Steele, \"Rawhide\" by Frankie Laine, \"Seven Little Girls Sitting in the Backseat\" by The Avons and \"Staccato's Theme\" by Elmer Bernstein were all released in 1959 but did not reach their peak until 1960. \"Love Makes the World Go 'Round\" by Perry Como, \"Tea for Two Cha Cha\" by The Tommy Dorsey Orchestra starring Warren Covington and \"Tom Dooley\" by The Kingston Trio were the singles from 1958 to reach their peak in 1959. Nineteen artists scored multiple entries in the top 10 in 1959. Adam Faith, Anthony Newley, Johnny and the Hurricanes, Neil Sedaka and Russ Conway were among the many artists who achieved their first UK charting top 10 single in 1959. The 1958 Christmas number-one, \"It's Only Make Believe\" by Conway Twitty, remained at number-one for the first four weeks of 1959. The first new number-one single of the year was \"The Day the Rains Came\" by Jane Morgan. Overall, sixteen different singles peaked at number-one in 1959, with Elvis Presley, Russ Conway, Bobby Darin and Cliff Richard (2) having the joint most singles hit that position. ==Background== ===Multiple entries=== Eighty singles charted in the top 10 in 1959, with seventy-one singles reaching their peak this year. Three songs were recorded by several artists with each version reaching the top 10: *\"Come Softly to Me\" - Frankie Vaughan & The Kaye Sisters, The Fleetwoods *\"Personality\" - Anthony Newley, Lloyd Price *\"Tom Dooley\" - The Kingston Trio (charted 1958, peaked this year), Lonnie Donegan (peaked 1958) Nineteen artists scored multiple entries in the top 10 in 1959. Russ Conway secured the record for most top 10 hits in 1959 with six hit singles. Shirley Bassey was one of a number of artists with two top-ten entries, including the number-one single \"As I Love You\". Anthony Newley, Frankie Vaughan, Neil Sedaka and Shirley Bassey were among the other artists who had multiple top 10 entries in 1959. ===Chart debuts=== Twenty-six artists achieved their first top 10 single in 1959, either as a lead or featured artist. Of these, four went on to record another hit single that year: Anthony Newley, Bobby Darin, Lloyd Price and Neil Sedaka. Russ Conway had five other entries in his breakthrough year. The following table (collapsed on desktop site) does not include acts who had previously charted as part of a group and secured their first top 10 solo single. {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw- collapsible mw-collapsed\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" background: #f6e39c; |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:55px;\"| Artist ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:55px;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| Number of top 10s ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| First entry ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:55px;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| Chart position ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text- align:center;\"| Other entries |- |Jane Morgan |1 |\"The Day the Rains Came (Le jour o\u00f9 la pluie viendra)\" |1 |-- |- |Russ Conway |6 |\"More Party Pops\" |10 |\"Side Saddle\" (1), \"Roulette\" (1), \"China Tea\" (5), \"Snow Coach\" (7), \"More and More Party Pops\" (5) |- | |1 |\"To Know Him is to Love Him\" |2 |-- |- |Slim Dusty |1 |\"A Pub with No Beer\" |3 |-- |- |Chris Barber's Jazz Band |1 |\"Petite Fleur\" |3 |-- |- |Lloyd Price |2 |\"Stagger Lee\" |7 |\"Personality\" (9) |- |Eddie Cochran |1 |\"C'mon Everybody\" |6 |-- |- | |1 |\"Charlie Brown\" |6 |-- |- | |1 |\"Come Softly to Me\" |6 |-- |- |Anthony Newley |2 |\"I've Waited So Long\" |3 |\"Personality\" (6) |- |Neil Sedaka |2 |\"I Go Ape\" |9 |\"Oh!

A second single, \"Little White Bull\", made number 6 later in the year. Cliff Richard's backing group previously charted under the name The Drifters, including three entries in 1959, but they changed their name to The Shadows towards the end of this year. \"Travellin' Light\" was the first song to reach the top 10 under their new identity, topping the chart for five weeks from 5 November. ===Songs from films=== Original songs from various films entered the top 10 throughout the year. These included \"Living Doll\" (from Serious Charge), \"Lonely Boy\" (Girls Town), \"The Heart of a Man\" (The Heart of a Man) and \"High Hopes\" (A Hole in the Head). ===Best-selling singles=== Until 1970 there was no universally recognised year-end best-sellers list. However in 2011 the Official Charts Company released a list of the best-selling single of each year in chart history from 1952 to date. According to the list, \"Living Doll\" by Cliff Richard and The Drifters is officially recorded as the biggest-selling single of 1959. \"What Do You Want to Make Those Eyes at Me For?\" (4), \"What Do You Want?\" (6), \"Living Doll\" (7) and \"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\" (10) all ranked in the top 10 best-selling singles of the decade. ==Top-ten singles== ;Key {| Class=\"wikitable\" !Symbol !Meaning |- |bgcolor=lightblue|\u2021 |Single peaked in 1958 but still in chart in 1959. |- |bgcolor=#DDFFDD|\u2666 |Single released in 1959 but peaked in 1960. |- |(#) |Year-end best-selling single. |- !Entered |The date that the single first appeared in the chart. |- !Peak |Highest position that the single reached in the UK Singles Chart. |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !
