The then Admiral of Patrols, Rear-Admiral J. M. de Robeck, assumed command on 26 July, 1914, (for Test Mobilisation), however the squadron was never officially constituted.Watson. 2015. De Robeck was then given command of the 9th Cruiser Squadron also known as Cruiser Force I on 4 August 1914. ===Second Formation=== In 1924/25 the 8th Light Cruiser Squadron was re-designated 8th Cruiser Squadron and was attached to the North America and West Indies Station under direct command of the Commander-in-Chief North America and West Indies until 1942. ===Cruiser deployments=== The Royal Navy's cruiser squadrons were usually distributed to both fleets and stations. They contained a maximum of five to six ships but down as low as two to three ships. From 1914 until 1924/25 they were usually designated as Light Cruiser Squadrons after 1925 they were re-designated Cruiser Squadrons.Watson. 2015. ==Rear/Vice-Admiral commanding== ===First Formation=== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! !!
