    "text": "The African Leopards are an African rugby union representative team, organised by the Confederation of African Rugby (CAR). The side will play an important role in promoting rugby in Africa. The Leopards are the first ever Pan-African representative rugby union team. ==History== The concept came about in 2005, and the team played their first ever match against the South African Students on July 23 at Ellis Park as a curtain raiser to the second Mandela Challenge Plate match between the Springboks and Australia. The team for the inaugural match was represented by Botswana, Cameroon, Kenya, Madagascar, Morocco, Namibia, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Tunisia, Uganda and Zambia. Zimbabwe and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire were not included as they were playing a 2007 World Cup qualifying match. The students ran out to a 12 to nil lead after five minutes, the Leopards lost the match but clawed their way back to reach a 15 to 30 final score. In their first overseas tour they beat the British Army Senior XV 20 to 10 at Aldershot on 23 November 2006. The match was part of the Army Rugby Union's (1906\u20132006) centenary celebrations. ==Results== Scorers: For South African Students: Tries: Spies, Matsaung, Olivier, Booysen Cons: Gallinetti 2 Pens: Gallinetti 2 For the African Leopards: Tries: Lloyd, Duvenhage Con: Sargos Pen: Sargos SA Students: 15 Michael Gallinetti (Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University), 14 Pierre Spies (Tukkies), 13 Lafras Uys (Tukkies), 12 Thabang Molefe (TUT), 11 Mpho Matsaung (TUT), 10 Naas Olivier (Pukke), 9 Mthunzi Mashalaba (University of the Western Cape), 8 Nelis Nel (Pukke), 7 Craig Kleu (UCT), 6 Frikkie Maartens (Johannesburg), 5 Gerhard Mostert (Pukke), 4 Bosman Grobler (Tukkies), 3 Nico de Villiers (Maties), 2 Louwtjie Louw (Shimlas), 1 Kalafo Tlaitane (Tukkies).
