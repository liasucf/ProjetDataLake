    "text": "right Joseph Elmer Ritter (July 20, 1892 \u2013 June 10, 1967) was an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of St. Louis from 1946 until his death in 1967, and was created a cardinal in 1961. He previously served as auxiliary bishop (1933\u201334) and bishop (later archbishop) (1934\u201346) of Indianapolis. Ritter was one of the cardinals elector who participated at the Papal Conclave,1963. ==Early life and education== Born July 20, 1892, in New Albany, Indiana, Elmer Joseph Ritter was the fourth of Nicholas (1859\u20131944) and Bertha (n\u00e9e Luette) (1865\u20131941) Ritter's six children. His father owned and operated the Ritter Bakery (where the family also lived). Both of Ritter's parents were of German descent. As a 1946 newspaper article said \"It was one of those shops, now rare, in which the whole family, the mother, father and the whole family had to help, either in the store part, which was in the front, or in the bakery which was in the rear.\" Ritter said his father had a great reverence of education, saying, \"Dad gave us all a chance to go to college, but only if we applied ourselves.\" Ritter received his early education at the parochial school of St. Mary of the Annunciation Church in New Albany where he was called \"Apple-Pie Ritter\". ===Religious calling=== During the seventh grade, Ritter decided to enter the priesthood. Ritter said \"There was no vision, no voice from heaven. I simply wanted to be a priest.\" In 1907, he enrolled at St. Meinrad's Seminary in southern Indiana, where he completed his studies in 1917. ==Priesthood== Ritter was ordained to the priesthood at the St. Meinrad Seminary's Abbey Church on May 30, 1917 by Bishop Joseph Chartrand. His first assignment was as a curate at St. Patrick's Church in Indianapolis. Shortly afterwards, he was transferred to Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral, also in Indianapolis where he served as assistant to the bishop in 1920 and rector of the cathedral in 1925 to 1933. In 1922, he received an honorary doctorate of theology from Pope Pius XI. ==Indianapolis years== On February 3, 1933, Ritter was appointed auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Indianapolis and titular bishop of Hippos by Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following March 28 from Bishop Chartrand, with Bishops Alphonse John Smith and Emmanuel Boleslaus Ledvina serving as co-consecrators. As an auxiliary bishop, he also served as vicar general of the diocese from 1933 to 1934. At age 40, he was one of the youngest Catholic bishops in the United States. Following the death of Bishop Chartrand, Ritter was appointed the seventh Bishop of Indianapolis on March 24, 1934. In 1938, he directed an end to racial segregation in all Catholic schools in the diocese. His decision, made 16 years before Brown v. Board of Education, was met with opposition by the Ku Klux Klan, whose members protested outside of SS. Peter and Paul Cathedral, and even by his fellow members of the clergy. Also during his tenure, Ritter reorganized the diocesan Catholic Charities, introduced the Catholic Youth Organization, and completed the construction of SS. Peter and Paul Cathedral. He reduced the diocese's debt by $3 million (). Ritter also reorganized the Catholic Charities in the diocese. The Diocese of Indianapolis was elevated to the status of an archdiocese by Pope Pius XII on October 21, 1944, and Ritter was installed as its first Archbishop on December 19, 1944. ==St. Louis years== Ritter was appointed the fourth Archbishop of St. Louis, Missouri, by Pius XII on July 20, 1946, succeeding the late Cardinal John J. Glennon. St. Louis grew quickly during the post-World War II economic boom. Ritter opened an average of three parishes per year in St. Louis city and county. An able administrator, without the authority to tax or compel, Ritter nevertheless raised more than $125,000,000 () to build sixty new parishes, sixteen high schools, and Cardinal Glennon Memorial Hospital during his tenure in the St. Louis diocese. ===Desegregation efforts=== As one of his first acts as archbishop, Ritter announced that Webster College would accept black students, endorsing the Sisters of Loretto\u2019s wish to enroll black women in their Webster College (which Ritter's predecessor Archbishop Glennon had ruled impossible). He also allowed the senior class of St. Joseph's High School, then the only black Catholic high school, to graduate for the first time at the Cathedral alongside white Catholic high school students. ===Desegregated diocesan schools and hospitals=== On August 9, 1947, Ritter announced an end to racial segregation in all five St. Louis diocesan high schools before the fall term. He declared, \"The cross on top of our schools must mean something,\" and expressed his belief in \"the equality of every soul before Almighty God\". Ritter sent a memo to all parish school superintendents, saying they must begin to \"accept all children into parish schools without regard to race\". In one stroke, Ritter had desegregated the Catholic St. Louis area schools, seven years before the US Supreme Court\u2019s \"Brown\" decision. The parochial schools represented one-quarter of all St. Louis area students. In response, a group of over 700 white Catholics from 49 St. Louis area parishes calling themselves the \"Catholic Parents Association of Saint Louis and Saint Louis County\" threatened to sue Ritter on the basis that his directive was contrary to Missouri state law. Association co-chairman William T. Rone said \"We do not want Negro children alongside our children in the schools.\" Ritter refused to meet their leaders, having his spokesman respond, saying, \"He is the father of the whole flock and must care for all, regardless of race.\" Ritter then issued a pastoral letter in which he warned of possible excommunication from the church for \"interfering with ecclesiastical office authority by having recourse to authority outside of the church\". While civil action was vetoed by the group, they did send a letter of protest to the Vatican, addressing their complaint to the Apostolic Delegate to the United States, Amleto Giovanni Cicognani. Cicognani responded (and sent Ritter a copy of his response in advance), saying \"I am confident that everyone will readily comply with what has been so clearly proposed by the ecclesiastical authority of the Archdiocese\". Ritter also desegregated all Catholic hospitals in the St. Louis archdiocese. ===Fundraising=== Ritter also developed what is now known as the Annual Catholic Appeal, which remains a primary source of financial support for many archdiocesan educational and charitable activities. ===Ecumenism=== On August 24, 1964, at Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis, Ritter celebrated the world\u2019s first authorized Mass in English. Ritter also forbade Catholics to see The French Line under danger of serious sin,TIME Magazine. The Censors January 11, 1954 and declared that Catholics must have written permission from the archdiocese to attend secular or non-Catholic colleges.TIME Magazine. The Letter June 20, 1960 He was one of the first bishops to create a diocesan mission, specifically in La Paz, Bolivia. Until that time, most missions had been conducted by Roman Catholic religious institutes or societies of apostolic life. The people of Saint Louis regularly contributed more money to these foreign missions than any archdiocese of its size. He served as president of the National Catholic Educational Association from 1955 to 1956, and was named an Assistant at the Pontifical Throne on October 5, 1956. ===Cardinal=== Ritter was created Cardinal Priest of SS. Redentore e S. Alfonso in Via Merulana by Pope John XXIII in the consistory of January 16, 1961. Between 1962 and 1965, he participated in all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council in Rome. Ritter was viewed as a liberal.TIME Magazine. Cum Magno Dolore October 23, 1964TIME Magazine.

At his request, it was a \"Low Funeral Mass\". Cardinal-designate John Patrick Cody, archbishop of Chicago, formerly an auxiliary bishop under the late cardinal in St. Louis, was the main celebrant. Cardinals Richard Cushing, James Francis McIntyre, Lawrence Shehan, and Francis Spellman attended, together with cardinals-designate John Krol and Patrick O'Boyle. Ten archbishops, forty- eight bishops, and four abbots were also in attendance. Some fifty Protestant, Jewish, and Orthodox leaders were present, representing the Episcopal Church, Missouri-Synod Lutheran, United Church of Christ, Greek Orthodox, Baptist, Disciples of Christ, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Salvation Army. In his sermon, Kansas City Bishop Charles Helmsing, another auxiliary bishop who had served under Ritter, spoke of Ritter's liturgical leadership, particularly \"his concern for a liturgy of the Word that would truly inform and enlighten the people of God.\" ===Burial and re-interrment=== Ritter was buried in the priest's lot at Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis. He had said he did not want to be buried in the cathedral. On November 2, 1994, Archbishop Justin Rigali of St. Louis had Ritter's remains removed from Calvary Cemetery and re-interred in the crypt of the new cathedral, now the cathedral basilica of St. Louis. ==Legacy== Mosaic depicting Joseph Cardinal Ritter. *Ritter is commemorated by a mosaic tile depiction in the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis showing him reaching out toward a group of people from other faiths on one side, and also an integrated group of school children on the other. *Ritter was a friend of Lionel HamptonTIME Magazine.
