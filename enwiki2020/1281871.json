He led league second basemen in fielding percentage in 1975. Alomar's offense was below-average with a .245 career batting average, 13 home runs and 282 RBI in 1,481 games played. He was, however, a great bunter and gathered a significant number of bunt singles in his career. Alomar enjoyed his best season in with career highs in batting average (.260), home runs (4), runs (82), hits (179) and games played (162), and received an All-Star berth. Alomar was a smart and aggressive base-runner compiling 227 stolen bases including a career high 39 in 1971. A durable player, Alomar was the Angels' everyday second baseman for five years. He twice played a full 162-game season and played in 648 consecutive games between 1969 and 1973. The only postseason at bat of Alomar's career came with the Yankees, during the 1976 American League Championship Series; he was standing on-deck when Chris Chambliss hit the series-winning home run in Game 5. After retiring, Alomar became a manager both in his homeland and minor leagues, and coached in the majors for the Chicago Cubs, Colorado Rockies and San Diego Padres. While in San Diego, Alomar coached his two sons, Sandy Jr. and Roberto. . After the season, Alomar was hired by the Mets as a bench coach and was moved to first base coach after the season. In 2007, he was moved to third base coach. On June 17, 2008 he was once again made bench coach of the Mets by former bench coach and recently promoted manager Jerry Manuel. Following the season, Alomar was let go by the Mets, and replaced by Dave Jauss. ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders * List of players from Puerto Rico in Major League Baseball * List of second-generation Major League Baseball players ==External links== Category:Major League Baseball second basemen Category:Major League Baseball players from Puerto Rico Category:Major League Baseball bench coaches Category:Major League Baseball first base coaches Category:Major League Baseball third base coaches Category:Milwaukee Braves players Category:Atlanta Braves players Category:New York Mets players Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:California Angels players Category:New York Yankees players Category:Texas Rangers players Category:American League All-Stars Category:New York Mets coaches Category:Chicago Cubs coaches Category:Colorado Rockies (baseball) coaches Category:San Diego Padres coaches Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Wellsville Braves players Category:Davenport Braves players Category:Boise Braves players Category:Austin Senators players Category:Denver Bears players Category:Atlanta Crackers players Category:Richmond Braves players Category:Jacksonville Suns players Category:Caribbean Series players Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:People from Salinas, Puerto Rico ",
