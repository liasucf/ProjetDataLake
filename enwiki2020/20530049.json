    "text": "Woody the Giant Killer is the 27th animated cartoon short subject in the Woody Woodpecker series. Released theatrically on December 15, 1947, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal Pictures. The film is a parody of the tale \"Jack and the Beanstalk\". == Plot == Out of work, Woody is weary from looking for a place to rent, and he complains about his not having any living quarters. He is then approached by city slicker Buck Beaver, who convinces him to buy some magic beans. Woody plants them, and a beanstalk shoots up to the clouds. An elevator takes Woody to a giant's castle, where he finds the dopey giant asleep and initially fails to wake him up. Woody puts mustard, red pepper and horseradish on his tongue, which does the trick. Woody hides from the giant in a stuffed olive and is almost swallowed until he uses a car jack to get out before smacking the giant with a fire shovel, throwing a banana peel, eventually turning the giant's castle into a series of apartments with the giant as a bellboy and Woody as his manager. == Notes == *This short was the last Woody Woodpecker entry to be distributed by Universal Pictures until 1951's Puny Express. == References == *Cooke, Jon, Komorowski, Thad, Shakarian, Pietro, and Tatay, Jack. \"1947\".
