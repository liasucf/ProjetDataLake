This beautiful little community is home to Live Oak Park and a lovely fishing pier. The Pinellas Trail runs through Crystal Beach, connecting north and south Pinellas County for bikers and those who enjoy long walks in our tropical paradise. This little community is convenient to all you could possibly need, yet far enough removed from the action that you feel you are living in the Florida of the 1950s! A wonderful place to live and play in the Florida sun! Category:Unincorporated communities in Pinellas County, Florida Category:Unincorporated communities in Florida ",
