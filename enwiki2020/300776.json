    "text": "Downsize This! Random Threats from an Unarmed American is a book by American author and producer Michael Moore. The book is a look at the state of business and industry in the United States and the power they hold over the U.S. government. In particular the book criticizes corporations who care more for shareholders than the safety and wellbeing of the communities who work for them. The book is part of Moore's ongoing campaign for increased corporate accountability. The book was first published in hardback in 1996 and later published in paperback in 1997. Moore refers to corporations receiving government tax breaks as \"corporate welfare mothers\". There is also a chapter about Hillary Clinton as well as two on OJ Simpson - one where Moore claims OJ was innocent of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, another where Moore claims OJ was guilty. And yet another chapter where Moore details his unsuccessful endeavors to have State Representative from the 46th District of California, Bob Dornan, involuntarily committed for psychiatric evaluation. == References == * Downsize This!, Michael Moore, Perennial, == External links == * Reviews and Chapter Selections on the author's website Category:1996 non-fiction books Category:Business books Category:Books by Michael Moore Category:Books about the United States Category:Books about politics of the United States de:Michael Moore#Quersch\u00fcsse ",
