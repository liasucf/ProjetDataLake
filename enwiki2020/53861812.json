    "text": "Ungaliophiinae is a subfamily of booid snakes containing two genera, Ungaliophis (2 species) and Exiliboa (1 species). They are small constrictors that are found in Central and South America, from southern Mexico to Colombia. They eat mostly lizards and frogs and are poorly studied. These snakes were formerly thought to be closely related to two other genera, Tropidophis and Trachyboa; all four genera were united in the family (Tropidophiidae) based on the presence of a tracheal lung and the absence of a left lung. However, Ungaliophis and Exiliboa are now known to be more closely related to booid snakes, whereas Tropidophis and Trachyboa are known to be more closely related to the South American red pipesnake Anilius. Within Booidea, Ungaliophis and Exiliboa are thought to be most closely related to North American Charina and Lichanura boas. ==References== Category:Boidae ",
