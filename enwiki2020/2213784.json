His 6\u20134, 1\u20136, 7\u20135, 6\u20130 win over Joshua Pim in 1891 at the age of 19 years and five months made him, until Boris Becker in 1985, the youngest men's singles champion at Wimbledon. He was also runner-up in 1893, 1894 and 1896. With Herbert, he won four doubles championships at Wimbledon in 1891, 1894 \u2013 1896. The twins retired from competitive lawn tennis after the 1897 Wimbledon Championships to pursue their law careers but made a reappearance in the doubles event at Wimbledon in 1904 and 1905. In total he participated in eight Wimbledon singles tournaments and eleven doubles tournaments between 1889 and 1905. Baddeley was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2013. == Professional life == In February 1895 the brothers qualified in London as solicitors. They joined their uncle and father Thomas and E. P. Baddeley in Leadenhall Street at the family firm, founded by their great grandfather in 1790. The brothers remained partners in the firm until 1919, when they retired leaving their cousin, Cyril Baddeley, to carry on in the family name. == Grand Slam finals == ===Singles: 6 (3 titles, 3 runners-up)=== {| class='sortable wikitable' !style=\"width:40px\"|Result !style=\"width:40px\"|Year !style=\"width:130px\"|Championship !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:160px\"|Opponent !style=\"width:170px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |-style=\"background:#cfc;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win ||1891 || Wimbledon || Grass || Joshua Pim || 6\u20134, 1\u20136, 7\u20135, 6\u20130 |-style=\"background:#cfc;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win ||1892 || Wimbledon || Grass || Joshua Pim || 4\u20136, 6\u20133, 6\u20133, 6\u20132 |-style=\"background:#cfc;\" | style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss ||1893 || Wimbledon || Grass || Joshua Pim || 6\u20133, 1\u20136, 3\u20136, 2\u20136 |-style=\"background:#cfc;\" | style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss ||1894 || Wimbledon || Grass || Joshua Pim || 8\u201310, 2\u20136, 6\u20138 |-style=\"background:#cfc;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win ||1895 || Wimbledon || Grass || W.
