Public education in Spanish, following the Spanish public education system is offered in Andorra. In 2008, 30,8% of students were enrolled in the Spanish education system.https://web.archive.org/web/20101113160513/http://www.estadistica.ad/serveiestudis/web/banc_dades4.asp?lang=1&codi;_tema=15&codi;_divisio=546&codi;_subtemes=88 === Belize === Spanish has no official recognition in the Central American nation of Belize, a Commonwealth realm where English is the official national language. However, the country shares land borders with Spanish-speaking Mexico and Guatemala and, per the 2010 Belizean census, Spanish is spoken by a sizable portion of the population; 30% claim Spanish as a mother tongue and about 50% of the population has working knowledge of the language.Statistical Institute of Belize: Belize Population and Housing Census 2010.

Public services, education, and information are widely available in Spanish, as are various forms of printed and broadcast media. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\" ! Territory !

However, today only a tiny minority of Spanish speakers in the US trace their language back to those times; the overwhelming majority of speakers come from recent immigration. Only in northern New Mexico and southern Colorado has Spanish maintained speaking communities uninterruptedly since colonial times. Spanish is the most studied foreign language in United States schools and is spoken as a native tongue by 41 million people, plus an additional 11 million fluent second-language speakers. Though not official, Spanish has a special status for education in the U.S. state of New Mexico.Language Rights and New Mexico Statehood By the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights With almost 60 million native speakers and second language speakers, the United States now has the second largest Spanish-speaking population in the world after Mexico. (Spanish) Spanish is increasingly used alongside English nationwide in business and politics. In the United States, the language is regulated by the North American Academy of the Spanish Language. == Historical language == === Philippines === Spanish was an official language of the Philippines from the beginning of the Hispanic period in 1565 and through independence until a constitutional change in 1973. However, President Ferdinand Marcos had Spanish redesignated as an official language under Presidential Decree No. 156, dated 15 March 1973 and Spanish remained official until 1987, when it was re-designated as a voluntary and optional auxiliary language.Article XIV, Sec 7: For purposes of communication and instruction, the official languages of the Philippines are Filipino and, until otherwise provided by law, English. The regional languages are the auxiliary official languages in the regions and shall serve as auxiliary media of instruction therein. Spanish and Arabic shall be promoted on a voluntary and optional basis. On 8 August 2007, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo announced that the Philippine government asked help from the Spanish Government in her plan to reintroduce Spanish as a required subject in the Philippine school system. By 2012, the language was a compulsory subject at only a very select number of secondary schools. In spite of government promotion of Spanish, less than 0.5% of the population are able to speak Spanish at least proficiently. While Spanish is designated as an optional government language in the Philippines, its usage is very limited and not present in everyday life.Constitution of the Philippines, Art. 14 Despite this, Tagalog and other native Philippine languages incorporate a large number of Spanish loanwords, as a result of 300 years of Spanish influence. In the country, Spanish is regulated by the Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language. === Western Sahara === Spanish is a secondary official language, alongside Arabic, in the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, a former Spanish colony and now a partially recognized state, most of whose territory is occupied by Morocco. Spanish is not a native language in that country. ===Morocco=== Spanish was an official language of the Spanish protectorate in Morocco until 1956. In a survey from 2005 by the CIDOB (Barcelona Centre for International Affairs), 21'9% of respondents from Morocco claimed to speak Spanish, with higher percentages in the former Spanish protectorate northern regions of Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima and Oriental, as well as in the areas around the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla. The use of Spanish in northern Morocco and Western Sahara derives largely from the fact that Spain had previously occupied those areas and incorporated Spanish Sahara as a province until 1976. == Creole languages == There are a number of Spanish-based creole languages. Chavacano is spoken in Zamboanga City in the Philippines and is a regional language.DepEd adds 7 languages to mother tongue-based education for Kinder to Grade 3. GMA News. 13 July 2013. Papiamento is the official language in Aruba, Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao; it has been classified as either a Spanish- based or a Portuguese-based creole. Chamorro is an Austronesian language with many Spanish loanwords; some scholars have considered it a creole, but the most authoritative sources deny this. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\" !
