    "text": "The 2011 Women's Hockey Champions Trophy was the 19th edition of the Hockey Champions Trophy for women. It was held from 25 June to 3 July 2011 in Amstelveen, Netherlands. The Netherlands won the tournament for the sixth time after defeating Argentina 3\u20132 in the final on a penalty shoot-out after a 3\u20133 draw, tying the record previously set by Australia in 2003 of six titles won. New Zealand won the third place match by defeating Korea 3\u20132 to claim their first ever Champions Trophy medal. After the preliminaries were over, the final originally was scheduled to be played between the Netherlands and Korea, but the Argentine side protested against the second round standing in which they were ranked third behind Korea based on goals scored in that round. After a second appeal by the Argentine team, the final day schedule was changed, since the regulations stated that in case of a draw in points in the second round, the total points in the tournament should be the next tie-breaker. ==Format== A new format was used for the 2011 tournament, with eight teams participating instead of the traditional six. All temas are split in two groups (pools A and B) and play a round robin. The top two teams advance to Pool C and play for the medals, the bottom two teams play in Pool D for fifth to eighth place. For this second round, points for the game with the advancing team from the same preliminary group are carried over and two games are played against teams from the other group. In the final classification games, the two top teams from Group C play for gold, the third and fourth team for bronze. The two top teams from Group D play for fifth and sixth place, while the third and fourth team of Group D play for seventh and eighth Place. ==Teams== The participating teams were determined by International Hockey Federation (FIH): * (Defending champions and champions of 2010 World Cup) * (Host nation and champions of 2008 Summer Olympics) * (Third in 2010 World Cup) * (Fourth in 2010 World Cup) * (Fifth in 2010 World Cup) * (Sixth in 2010 World Cup) * (Invitational) * (Invitational) ==Squads== Head coach: Carlos Retegui Head coach: Adam Commens Head coach: Kim Sang-Ryul Head coach: Danny Kerry Head coach: Michael Behrmann Head coach: Maximiliano Caldas Head coach: Mark Hager Head coach: Lim Jung-Woo ==Umpires== Below are the 11 umpires appointed by the International Hockey Federation: *Stella Bartlema (NED) *Frances Block (ENG) *Elena Eskina (RUS) *Amy Hassick (USA) *Christiane Hippler (GER) *Kelly Hudson (NZL) *Michelle Joubert (RSA) *Miao Lin (CHN) *Irene Presenqui (ARG) *Lisa Roach (AUS) *Chieko Soma (JPN) ==Results== All times are Central European Summer Time (UTC+02:00) ===First round=== ====Pool A==== \\---- \\---- ====Pool B==== \\---- \\---- ===Medal round=== ====Pool C==== Argentina was moved to second place after a second appeal. \\---- ===Non-medal round=== ====Pool D==== \\---- ===Classification=== ====Seventh and eighth place==== ====Fifth and sixth place==== ====Third and fourth place==== ====Final==== ==Awards== {| class=wikitable style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center\" !style=\"width: 220px;\"|Player of the Tournament !style=\"width: 220px;\"|Top Goalscorer !style=\"width: 220px;\"|Goalkeeper of the Tournament |- | Maartje Paumen | Maartje Paumen | Bel\u00e9n Succi |- !style=\"width: 220px;\"|Young Player of the Tournament !style=\"width: 220px;\"|Fair Play Trophy !style=\"width: 220px;\"|Best Goal |- | Willemijn Bos | | Zhao Yudiao |} ==Statistics== ===Final standings=== ===Goalscorers=== ==References== ==External links== *Official FIH website *Results book Category:Women's Hockey Champions Trophy Champions Trophy Hockey Champions Trophy Category:International women's field hockey competitions hosted by the Netherlands Category:Sports competitions in Amstelveen Hockey Champions Trophy Women Hockey Champions Trophy Women ",
