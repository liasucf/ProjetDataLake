He is considered one of the masters of Neoclassical and late Baroque paintings, and was very influenced by Jakov Orfelin and Teodor Kra\u010dun. Georgije Bakalovi\u0107 was one of his pupils. Gavrilovi\u0107, whose work anticipated the arrival of the new artistic tendency -- the Neoclassicism -- had his studio workshop in Sremski Karlovci.He made many flags for the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire. He authored Mojsije Putnik's portrait, among many other paintings, icons and frescoes.
