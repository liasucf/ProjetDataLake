    "text": "This article deals with historic administrative divisions of Czechoslovakia up to 1992, when the country was split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia and the divisions were changed. For the current divisions of those two countries, see their main articles and the articles Regions of Slovakia and Regions of the Czech Republic. ==Latest division (1960\u20131992)== The country consisted of 10 Regions ('kraje'), Prague, and (since 1970) Bratislava; further divided in 109-114 districts ('okresy'). The kraje were abolished temporarily in Slovakia in 1969-1970 and since late 1990 in whole Czechoslovakia. In addition, the two republics Czech Socialist Republic and Slovak Socialist Republic were established in 1969 during the federalization process. The word Socialist was removed from the republics' names in 1990 after the Velvet Revolution. Since many regions changed significantly after the Velvet Divorce of 1993, here is list of their original names and current regions they approximately correspond to: ===Czech (Socialist) Republic=== (the names are in Czech) * Praha * St\u0159edo\u010desk\u00fd kraj: today Central Bohemian Region * Jiho\u010desk\u00fd kraj: today South Bohemian Region * Z\u00e1pado\u010desk\u00fd kraj (West Bohemian Region): today Plze\u0148 Region and Karlovy Vary Region * Severo\u010desk\u00fd kraj (North Bohemian Region): today \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem Region, and most of Liberec Region * V\u00fdchodo\u010desk\u00fd kraj (East Bohemian Region): today Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Region, Pardubice Region, and small parts of Liberec Region and Vyso\u010dina Region * Jihomoravsk\u00fd kraj (South Moravian Region): today South Moravian Region, and most of Vyso\u010dina Region and Zl\u00edn Region * Severomoravsk\u00fd kraj (North Moravian Region): today Moravian- Silesian Region, Olomouc Region, and part of Zl\u00edn Region ===Slovak (Socialist) Republic=== (the names are in Slovak) * Bratislava: today a part of the Bratislava Region * Z\u00e1padoslovensk\u00fd kraj (West Slovak Region): Trnava Region, Nitra Region, most of Bratislava Region, and a small part of Tren\u010d\u00edn Region * Stredoslovensk\u00fd kraj (Central Slovak Region): today \u017dilina Region, Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica Region, and a large part of Tren\u010d\u00edn Region * V\u00fdchodoslovensk\u00fd kraj (East Slovak Region): today Pre\u0161ov Region and Ko\u0161ice Region ==History== Czechoslovakia between 1918\u201328 (with five provinces/lands \u2013 Slovakia and Subcarpathian Rus newly created) Czechoslovakia since December 1, 1928; state administration was unified in both \u2013 former Austrian or Hungarian \u2013 parts of the state, while number of provinces reduced to four (Moravia and Czech Silesia merged) \"Small, but ours\": Czecho-Slovakia in 1938\u201339, with Slovakia and Subcarpathian Ruthenia as autonomous regions while the Sudetenland and southern Slovakia and Subcarpathian Ruthenia are ceded to Nazi Germany and Hungary *1918-1923: different systems based on former Austrian territories (Kingdom of Bohemia, Margraviate of Moravia, and Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia) and former Hungarian counties in the north (later forming Slovakia (21 counties) and Subcarpathian Ruthenia (4 counties)) were reorganized into three provinces (, \u2013 literally \"lands\") of Bohemia-Moravia-Silesia, 21 counties (\u017eupy) of Slovakia, and 4 counties of Subcarpathian Ruthenia (today's Zakarpattia Oblast in Ukraine); all provinces and counties were further divided into districts (okresy) *1923-1927: like above, except that the above counties were replaced by 6 (grand) counties ((ve\u013e)\u017eupy) in Slovakia and 1 (grand) county in Subcarpathian Ruthenia, and the number and frontiers of districts were changed on these two territories *1928-1938: 4 provinces: Bohemia, Moravia-Silesia, Slovakia and Subcarpathian Ruthenia; divided into districts *late 1938-March 1939: like above, but Slovakia and Subcarpathian Ruthenia were promoted to \"autonomous lands\", while the border regions were ceded to Germany (so-called Sudetenland) and Hungary (southern parts of Slovakia and Subcarpathian Ruthenia) *1939-1945: Bohemia and Moravia became the protectorate Germany, the remainder of Subcarpathian Ruthenia annexed by Hungary, while Slovakia was nominally independent *1945-1948: like 1928-1938, except that Subcarpathian Ruthenia became part of the Soviet Union in 1945 *1949-1960: 19 regions divided in 270 districts; Czech historical provinces/lands abolished *1960-1992: see above Category:Government of Czechoslovakia Czechoslovakia ",
