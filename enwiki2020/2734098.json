Unfortunately for Ullrich, when the war ended players returned to their teams. Like many others, Ullrich found himself out of the Major Leagues. ==References== ==External links== * *Mexican League statistics *Venezuelan Professional Baseball League statistics Category:1921 births Category:2001 deaths Category:Alijadores de Tampico players Category:Angeles de Puebla players Category:Azules de Veracruz players Category:Caribbean Series players Category:Cienfuegos players Category:Diablos Rojos del M\u00e9xico players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Major League Baseball players from Cuba Category:Mexican League baseball pitchers Category:M\u00e9xico Azul players Category:Patriotas de Venezuela players Category:Rojos del \u00c1guila de Veracruz players Category:Washington Senators (1901\u20131960) players ",
