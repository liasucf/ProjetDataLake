    "text": "Todd Decker is an American musicologist. He is the Paul Tietjens Professor of Music at Washington University in St. Louis. Decker graduated from Fresno Pacific College in 1989, then earned a Master of Music degree in harpsichord from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music in 1991. He completed the Ph.D. at the University of Michigan in 2007 and joined the faculty of Washington University in St Louis that same year. Decker's research, teaching, and publications generally focus on American popular music from 1920 to the present, with particular emphasis on the Broadway and Hollywood musical, Hollywood film music (and sound), the recorded popular music industry, and jazz (before 1970). ==Expert witness== In 2019, Decker testified as an expert witness in a lawsuit against Katy Perry, stating that Christian rapper Flame produced a \"unique\" eight-note \"ostinato\" - a repeating sequence of musical figures within a song - which Flame's legal team claims Perry plagiarized. Decker further testified that the ostinatos used in Perry's 2013 song \"Dark Horse\" and Flame's 2008 song \"Joyful Noise\" share \u201cfive or six points of similarity.\u201d A blog post by copyright law expert Stephen Carlisle supported the verdict. A jury verdict that found the Katy Perry song did infringe the copyright of Flames's song was overturned on appeal on the 16th March 2020. ==Publications== ;Books * * * * ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Washington University in St. Louis faculty Category:American musicologists Category:Fresno Pacific University alumni Category:San Francisco Conservatory of Music alumni Category:University of Michigan alumni ",
