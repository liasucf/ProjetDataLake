An owner, whose name was Murdoch, purchased a building at the corner of Bredgade and Dronningens Tv\u00e6rgade it in 1837 and converted into another hotel under the name Hotel Stadt Hamburg. The name of the hotel in Store Strandstr\u00e6de was changed to Hotel Victoria in circa 1900. It closed in 1960. ==Architecture== The three- storey building has eight bays towards Store Strandstr\u00e6de and four bays towards Lille Strandstr\u00e6de. The avscence of a canted corner bay is atypical for buildings constructed immediately after the Copenhagen Fire of 1805 since this was normally a requirement under the new Copenhagen Building Act. The facade on Lille Strandstr\u00e6de is crowned by a two-bay gabled dormer. ==Today== An antique toys and dolls store is based in the ground floor. The upper floors are offices. Companies based the building include Casa Nord. ==References== ==External links== * Casa Nord Category:Listed residential buildings in Copenhagen Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1799 ",
