He then attended Cheltenham College before winning a choral scholarship to sing in the Choir of King's College, Cambridge under Boris Ord. A former member of the Purcell Singers, Burgess formed the Purcell Consort of Voices in 1963.Christopher Grogan Imogen Holst: A Life in Music: Revised Edition p382 He also sang with the Studio der fr\u00fchen Musik and the Musica Reservata Ensemble of Michael Morrow and John Beckett. Burgess premiered compositions including Michael Tippett's \"Songs for Ariel\". After moving to rural Herefordshire in the 1980s, he taught singing at Ellerslie School, Malvern, and, on its closure, at Malvern College. His pupils included ex-Swingle Singer Wendy Nieper. In 2000 he accepted an invitation to help form, and to direct, a local community choir to celebrate the Millennium. After its performance - of Haydn's Creation - this choir continued as a permanent feature in the form of Choir 2000, which became his inspiration and to which he himself has been an inspiration. In 2017 he was referred to by the Daily Telegraph as a 'veteran conductor and choir director' https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/08/let- trebles-sing-cathedral-choirs-should-all-male/ when he was interviewed for an article published on International Women's Day about the presence of women in British cathedral choirs. The article made no mention of his connection with the Campaign for the Traditional Cathedral Choir, a group which actively discriminates against the inclusion of women and girls in Cathedral and church choirs. ==Selected discography== Countertenor - Soloist * Dowland LP Conductor - Purcell Consort of Voices * Music of Albert: Prince of Saxe, Coburg und Gotha Decca/Australian Eloquence. ==References== ==External links== * Official Website and biography * Purcell Consort of Voices discography * Category:1932 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Countertenors Category:People from Folkestone Category:Choral Scholars of the Choir of King's College, Cambridge ",
