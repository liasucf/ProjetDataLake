    "text": "The Warsaw Military District () was one of three military districts in Poland, the other two being the Pomeranian Military District and the Silesian Military District. It was the regional executive body of the Ministry of National Defense of Poland in the capital of Warsaw in operational and defense matters and military administration existing from 1945-1998. ==District history== After the end of World War II, six military districts were formed, and operating as of 1 August 1945, including the WOW. Months before in April, the Olsztyn was included in the district. In November 1945 the commander of the district was given the designation DOW I. In the autumn of 1945, the Faculty of the 2nd Division of Border Protection Forces (WOP) was formed at the Warsaw Military Command. The district, apart from administrative functions, also fulfilled the role of operational level command, subject to tactical relations and units stationed in its area.Pawe\u0142 Piotrowski, \u015al\u0105ski Okr\u0119g Wojskowy ... s. 44.Jan \u0141awski, Czes\u0142aw \u017bmuda, Wojska Ochrony Pogranicza ... s. 27, 28, 40. In 1949, the district was renamed the Warsaw Military District (WOW). In 1954, after the liquidation of the Krakow Military District, the WOW extended its reach to many regions such as Lublin, Kielce, Krakow and Rzesz\u00f3w. After the establishment of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact in 1955, the corps and part of the infantry division were disbanded. The remaining infantry divisions were transformed into mechanized divisions and were absorbed into the WOW. From the mid-1960s, in the event of a war on the basis of command and WOW units, the 4th Army was formed as part of the WOW. From April 1990, instead of the 4th General Army, based on the WOW, the 3 Mechanized Corps of the \"W\" time was created. At the end of 1998, as part of the reorganization of the military from military districts, the military district was disassembled and was primarily replaced through the Warsaw Garrison Command which was established three years prior.Warszawski Okr\u0119g Wojskowy.
