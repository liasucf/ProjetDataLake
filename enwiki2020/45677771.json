The village of Llangrove has had many names and spellings, Langrove, Longrove, Longgrove, Longuegroue, Long-grove, Long Grove.Llangrove Village Website - Retrieved 23 May 2019 In the 14th and 15th centuries the village was referred to as 'Longegrove', but the early parish registers of Llangarron mention 'Long Grove'. By the 1850s the spelling had changed to Llangrove. In 1862 a local directory referred to 'Llangrove Common'. The parish records from Llangarron (before there was a church at Llangrove) refer to the burial of 'Elizabeth Evans of the Grove'. In fact, the older residents of the village, now departed, always spoke of 'living on the Grove'. The village is not a 'traditional village' built around a village green but the centre is marked by the church, the war memorial and the school. The village is sited on high ground. From the north there are perfect views extending to the Malverns and round to May Hill. From the south one can see Symonds Yat and the Doward, round to Welsh Newton Common, then westwards to Garway and the Brecon hills. == History == The parish of Llangrove is of relatively recent formation, having been carved out of Llangarron in 1856-7. The land for the building of the church and the school was given by Mrs Marriott, the lady of the manor of Goodrich. The fact that she owned land in the centre of the village reflects the fact that the populated centre of Llangrove has been largely formed upon land which was originally a common belonging to the lord of the manor of Goodrich. Extensive encroachment settlement took place on this common, and the adjacent one of Old Grove from the 17th C onwards, though mostly in the later 18th C & 19tth C. By the time of the formation of the new parish, there were many souls in need of a nearer church than the parish church at Llangarron, though there was already a non-conformist element. Long Grove and Old Grove commons were enclosed with the consent of the manor\u2019s \u2018meese\u2019 tenants after proposals were initiated in 1815. The original name of the common was Long Grove, and in 1372 it is mentioned as \u2018Longegroue\u2019 with \u2018Douwarth\u2019 as underwood \u2018containing 100acres; it is made into charcoal every ninth year, and is then worth 10l.\u2019 Old Grove is not mentioned separately at this early date. Old Grove is typical of the wooded commons within the manor of Goodrich, being steeply sloping uncultivatable land. Long Grove is different, mostly being relatively flat land although somewhat exposed at around 140m above sea level. It bears a resemblance in situation to Garway common, which has remained largely undeveloped. Perhaps this is a reflection of the easier attitude to encroachment of Goodrich manor, provided (of course) that the encroachers paid their fines in lieu of rent. Together, Old Grove and Long Grove covered about 124 acres in 1718. === Wellington Bomber Crash === On 7 July 1942, a Wellington bomber (T2962) on a training flight from Edgehill, near Banbury, crash-landed in Llangrove after two of its engines failed. It ended up in a field opposite Christ Church in the village, only narrowly avoiding the church and school. Two of the six crewmen were killed: Pilot Sgt F. H. S. Bush from London, and Observer Sgt R. J. McKean from Glasgow. Other crew members Sgt LC Baker, Sgt TG Baycroft, Sgt A Hill and Sgt HA Hill were all injured in the crash. The Revd Frank Easton, who had been the Vicar since 1936, rushed to assist the crew, but had a heart attack and died as he cycled home afterwards. He was 59. Sarah Watkins, the church organist, also collapsed and died of heart failure on the way to the crash scene. A memorial plaque was unveiled 3 October 2010 in Christ Church Llangrove. == Churches and Chapels of Llangrove == === Christ Church === Christ Church is currently the only active church within Llangrove. It is located in the village centre on the main route through the village. Built between 1854 and 1856, it is the first complete church building to be designed by George Frederick Bodley (1827-1907) who went on to become one of the major architects of the Victorian Gothic revival. Coursed and square sand-stone rubble, ashlar dressings, C20 tiled roof. Nave, south porch and south aisle, chancel. In the style of c1300. Four-bay nave: three windows with 2-trefoiled lights to south aisle; lean-to roof east of gabled porch. Gabled bell cote to west end. Two-bay chancel with one window of 2-trefoil headed lights and cinquefoil in roundel with hood- mould to west and 3-light window to east with trefoils and cusping to outer lights flanking central trefoil headed light with trefoil roundel above, hoodmould, central stepped buttress and diagonal buttressing to east end. Interior: nave: trussed rafter roof. Open wagon roof to chancel; south arcade: three bays, simple chamfered piers without capitals. The land was given by Mrs Catherine Marriott, Lady of the Manor of Goodrich, so that the new church could be built. She paid for the whole cost of building and furnishing - about one thousand five hundred pounds. Christ Church is also a Grade II listed building. === Glynston Chapel === Glynston Chapel was a church situated in Chapel Meadow, adjacent to the road to Welsh Newton Common on the edge of Llangrove and was a Chapel of worship. It is believed that there was never any wedding or funerals carried out in the chapel. There are no remains today but mention was made of it in the 17th century as Glynstons Chapill. In 1816 ruins of a chapel called Gluistons Chapel were recorded. In September 1989 a parched area 29 paces into the meadow. This was apparently visible on a level area a few yards north of a line of an old watercourse, c12' wide, 20' long, area then widened c18-26' & about 22' long giving an overall length of c42'. The chapel is thought to have stood until the Black Death after which it fell into decline. === Congregational Chapel === Former non-conformist chapel adjoining former rectory (Llangrove Cottage qv). c1840. Built of coursed and squared sandstone rubble with ashlar dressings and a hipped slate roof. Rectangular shaped building adjoining Llangrove Cottage to west, north entrance, moulded cornice and string course, cast iron canopy supported on four pillars to entrance, semi-circular headed doorway with fanlight and panelled doors. Two windows to west side with flat arches, stone heads with keystones and glazing bar sash windows. Interior consists of panelled shutters to windows and panelled dado and central cupola. Llangrove Cottage was bought by the Reverend John Jones who added a large room which was used for public worship and it became known as the Langrove Congregational Church. In the garden, it is said lie several gravestones and somewhere under the front doorway is the Jones family vault where some of the family, and the children who died young, are buried. This ceased to be a place of worship 20 October 1968. It remains on its old site in a farmyard. It obtained Grade II Listed Building status on 3 July 1985 === Wesleyan Chapel === Closed 23 June 1968. Has since been converted into a domestic dwelling. === Methodist Chapel === This has ceased to be a place of worship and has been converted into a dwelling. == Dwellings == The village consists of a number of old cottages, small farm houses, bungalows and modern housing with much of the building has taken place in the last few years. The housing is mainly along the minor road that leads through the village. The tiny hamlet of Trewen lies just outside the village. It consists of Great Trewen, Symond's Trewen, Little Trewen, Trewen Cottage and Trewen farm. There was an old house at Great Trewen, pre -Elizabathan era, which has sadly burned down, but it is thought that it was whitewashed and so the hamlet was named Trewen ; gwyn, from which wen comes, meaning white. There still remains an old barn whose beams and crucks are said to have come from oaks in the Forest of Dean, some of the beams are reputed to be old ships' timbers. Many of the old cottages in Llangrove are built end-on to the lane, this was so that residents did not have to step out of their front doors onto the muddy lane. Cobblers Cottage is an example of the typical small dwellings that originally existed in the village, built probably around the middle of the 18th century, is the last surviving intact building of its kind in the village (the only other surviving cottage is derelict, fronting the grounds of Llangrove House). It is named after the occupation of a former inhabitant who is reputed to have lived there with his wife and six children. The cobbler worked under a tarpaulin at the front of the house and his children slept in the loft. The surrounding grounds would have originally been a smallholding providing fresh meat and vegetables for the family. The cottage is now an outbuilding in the grounds of a house called Breamore. == Listed Buildings == Listed Buildings in Llangrove are the former Congregational Chapel, the adjoining Llangrove Cottage, Christ Church and Llangrove War Memorial. On the outskirts of the village two other listed buildings are the Cow Shed at The Grove and the Barn at The Grove, both of which have now been converted into accommodation.

Llangrove War Memorial is listed at Grade II for the following two principal reasons, firstly historic interest as an eloquent witness to the tragic impact on the local community of the events of the First World War, secondly for architectural interest since the memorial is a dignified and sombre Celtic- style cross, neatly made and well-proportioned. ==== History ==== The aftermath of the First World War saw the biggest single wave of public commemoration ever with tens of thousands of memorials erected across England. This was the result of both the huge impact on communities of the loss of three quarters of a million British lives, and also the official policy of not repatriating the dead: therefore the memorials provided the main focus of the grief felt at this great loss. One such memorial was raised at Llangrove as a permanent testament to the sacrifice made by the members of the local community who lost their lives in the First World War. ==== Details ==== A First World War memorial, dating from around 1920. The memorial is constructed of stone. The memorial stands in a prominent roadside location in front of the primary school and a short distance from Christ Church (Grade II). The memorial comprises a tall Celtic wheel-cross with tapering shaft on a tapering rectangular pedestal and single-stepped base. The face and shaft of the cross are decorated with carved interlace. The main inscription in leaded lettering on the south face of the plinth reads: > IN GRATEFUL MEMORY OF THESE WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR KING AND COUNTRY IN THE > GREAT WAR. A.D. 1914 \u2013 1918 (14 NAMES) GREATER LOVE HATH NO MAN THAN THIS, > THAT A MAN LAY DOWN HIS LIFE FOR HIS FRIENDS == Notable People == === Authors === The village has several published authors: Simon Jones - The transit of Mercury Julia Sutherland - The Tug of War Karen Wren - The Forest of Dean \\- The Wye Valley \\- The Best of Herefordshire's Golden Valley & Welsh Borderland \\- The Elan Valley - a Photographic Tour Caroline Davis Hayward - My Garland of Verses, A Selection of Poems === Singers === Catherine King, mezzo-soprano, studied at Trinity College Cambridge and the Guildhall School of Music. === Awards === ==== Order of the British Empire ==== Air Commodore (Retired) Vivian (Viv) Warrington OBE - learnt to fly during National Service with the RAF from 1952 to 1954.

There was another 'beer house' called the Plough and Harrow during the 1850s run by a Richard Meredith, but the site is unknown. The Royal Arms, a wayside pub is in a building that dates back to the 17th century. It was a blacksmith's shop and 'beer house' in the early 19th century owned by the Watkins family of blacksmiths and by 1851 became known as the Smith's Arms run by James Weal. From around 1858 until 1870 the landlady was Mrs. Elizabeth Burford, and although Charles Mapp had purchased the Smiths Arms in 1862 for \u00a3300, he did not take over the running of the pub until 1870. During his occupancy of nearly 30 years he changed the pub's name to The Royal Arms in 1881 to commemorate Queen Vitoria's long reign. In 1890, The Royal Arms was sold to Alton Court Brewery, and has since then, despite various changes, it has remained open. It is now an independent pub. == Sport and Leisure == Llangrove currently has a Table Tennis club.
