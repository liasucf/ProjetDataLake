The club has previously also competed in ice hockey (see separate article), bandy, and bowling. \u00d6ster was formed on 20 April 1930 as \u00d6sters Fotbollf\u00f6rening, before adopting the name \"\u00d6sters IF\" in 1932. The club is affiliated to the Sm\u00e5lands Fotbollf\u00f6rbund. In 1968, their first season in Allsvenskan, \u00d6ster became the first team ever to win the national title at their first attempt (newly-promoted IF Elfsborg won the league in 1961 but had played in, and been winners of, the championship in the past).:sv:IF Elfsborg This win ignited the team's 'golden age' which lasted until the early 1980s and saw them win a total of four Swedish championships. On 31 March 2011, \u00d6ster broke ground on their new arena, Myresj\u00f6hus Arena, which was inaugurated in August 2012. The arena hosted four games of the UEFA Women's Euro 2013 tournament. ==History== A chart showing the progress of \u00d6sters IF through the swedish football league system. The different shades of gray represent league divisions. \u00d6ster (English: \"East\") was named after a district in the city of V\u00e4xj\u00f6. They were not part of the upper divisions in the early days of swedish football and only made their first appearance in the third tier in 1947. During the 1950s and early-1960s the club made a push to raise the level of football by inviting and playing against foreign teams such as Flamengo, Juventus and Fluminense. This coupled with an increase in the amount of training helped the team establish themselves in the second tier. In 1961 \u00d6ster had their first chance ever to qualify for Allsvenskan but ended up in last place in the four team promotion playoffs. Success in the promotion playoffs would instead come six years later in 1967 when they beat IK Brage in the deciding game in front of a home crowd of 26,404 people. \u00d6ster defied the odds during their first season in the top division and won the league on goal difference after a total of four teams had ended the season on exactly the same number of points. Following their championship title the club had ten years of solid Allsvenskan finishes before becoming dominant in the late-1970s and early-1980s where they won the league three times in four years. After that successful era followed a slow decline over the next couple of decades which culminated in their relegation to the second tier in 1998. After that the club has found it hard to reestablish itself in Allsvenskan and has only made short one year appearances. ==Current squad== ==Personnel== The team during a pregame warmup in 2012 wearing their traditional red and blue kits. ===Current technical staff=== {| |- | Head Coach: | Denis Veli\u0107 |- | Assistant Coach: | - |- | Goalkeeper Coach: | Rasmus Ryden |- | Physical Coach: | Rikard Engstr\u00f6m |- | Head of youth department: | Peter Wibr\u00e5n |} ==Managers== * Bertil B\u00e4ckvall (1958\u201363) * Vilmos Varszegi (1967\u201373) * Bengt \"Julle\" Gustavsson (1973\u201374) * Gunnar Nordahl (1975\u201376) * Lars \"Laban\" Arnesson (1977\u201380) * Bo Johansson (1980\u201382) * Leif Wid\u00e9n (1982\u201385) * Bo Johansson (1986\u201388) * Peo Bild (1988\u201389) * Hans Backe (1989\u201394) * Nanne Bergstrand (1994\u201396) * Andreas Ravelli (1997\u201398) * Bo Axberg (1998) * Jan Mattsson (1998\u201301) * Yevgeni Kuznetsov (2002\u201303) * Leif Wid\u00e9n (2003\u201304) * Lars Jacobsson (2005\u201306) * Giles Stille (1 January 2007 \u2013 31 December 2008) * Yevgeni Kuznetsov (2008\u201309) * Andreas Ottosson (2009\u201310) * Ludwig Ernstsson (9 July 2010 \u2013 9 September 2010) * Hans Gren (10 September 2010 \u2013 31 December 2010) * Roar Hansen (1 January 2011 \u2013 31 December 2012) * Andreas Thomsson (1 January 2013 \u2013 29 December 2013) * Roberth Bj\u00f6rknesj\u00f6 (30 December 2013 \u2013 31 December 2014) * Thomas Askebrand (1 January 2015 \u2013 4 November 2017) * Christian J\u00e4rdler (1 January 2018 \u2013 Present) http://www.osterfotboll.com/uploads/publiktrycket_april_2007.pdf ==Achievements== Striker Harry Bild was part of the team that won the club's first title in the 1968 Allsvenskan. * Swedish Champions ** Winners (4): 1968, 1978, 1980, 1981 ===League=== * Allsvenskan: ** Winners (4): 1968, 1978, 1980, 1981 ** Runners-up (3): 1973, 1975, 1992 * Superettan: ** Winners (2): 2002, 2012 ** Runners-up (1): 2005 * Division 1 S\u00f6dra: ** Winners (3): 1989, 2009, 2016 ** Runners-up (1): 2008 ===Cups=== * Svenska Cupen: ** Winners (1): 1977 ** Runners-up (4): 1974, 1982, 1985, 1991 * Allsvenskan play-offs: ** Runners- up (1): 1983 ==Attendances== V\u00e4rendsvallen: \u00d6ster stadium 1966\u20132012 Visma Arena: \u00d6ster stadium 2012\u2013 In recent seasons \u00d6sters IF have had the following average attendances: {| |valign=\"top\" width=0%| {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#f0f6fa;\" !Season !Average Attendance !Division / Section !Level |- |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|2004 |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|2,670 |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|Superettan |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"| Tier 2 |- |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|2005 |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|3,517 |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|Superettan |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"| Tier 2 |- |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|2006 |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|5,364 |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"| Allsvenskan |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"| Tier 1 |- |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|2007 |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|2,791 |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|Superettan |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"| Tier 2 |- |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|2008 |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|1,817 |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"| Div 1 S\u00f6dra |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"| Tier 3 |- |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|2009 |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|1,919 |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"| Div 1 S\u00f6dra |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"| Tier 3 |- |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|2010 |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|2,145 |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|Superettan |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"| Tier 2 |- |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|2011 |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|2,637 |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|Superettan |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"| Tier 2 |- |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|2012 |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|4,733 |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|Superettan |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"| Tier 2 |- |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|2013 |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|5,751 |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"| Allsvenskan |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"| Tier 1 |- |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|2014 |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"|3,289 |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"| Superettan |style=\"background:#E6E6FA;\"| Tier 2 |} * Attendances are provided in the Publikliga sections of the Svenska Fotbollf\u00f6rbundet website. |} ==Footnotes== :A Current youth players who at least have sat on the bench in a competitive match. :B. The title of \"Swedish Champions\" has been awarded to the winner of four different competitions over the years. Between 1896 and 1925 the title was awarded to the winner of Svenska M\u00e4sterskapet, a stand-alone cup tournament. No clubs were given the title between 1926 and 1930 even though the first-tier league Allsvenskan was played. In 1931 the title was reinstated and awarded to the winner of Allsvenskan. Between 1982 and 1990 a play-off in cup format was held at the end of the league season to decide the champions. After the play-off format in 1991 and 1992 the title was decided by the winner of M\u00e4sterskapsserien, an additional league after the end of Allsvenskan. Since the 1993 season the title has once again been awarded to the winner of Allsvenskan. ==References== ==External links== * \u00d6sters IF \u2013 official site * \u2013 supporter site Category:Football clubs in Sweden Category:Allsvenskan clubs Category:Sport in V\u00e4xj\u00f6 Category:Defunct bandy clubs in Sweden Category:Bandy clubs established in 1930 Category:Association football clubs established in 1930 Category:1930 establishments in Sweden ",
