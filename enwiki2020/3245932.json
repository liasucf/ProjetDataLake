    "text": "Bento Teixeira (1561? \u2013 1618?) was a Portuguese poet. He is considered to be the introducer of Baroque in the Portuguese colony of Brazil and the first Brazilian poet \u2014 however, this last affirmation is contested by many historians. ==Life== Details about Teixeira's life are very sparse. His birthplace is most commonly accepted to be Porto, Portugal, to Manuel \u00c1lvares de Barros and Lianor Rodrigues. Teixeira moved to the colony of Brazil in 1567(?), first living in Bahia, but he had to flee to Pernambuco when he was accused of being a Jew. In Pernambuco, Bento Teixeira became a teacher of Arithmetics, Grammar and Latin. Returning to Bahia, he married Filipa Raposa in the city of Ilh\u00e9us, in 1584(?). Allegedly, Teixeira murdered his wife under suspects of adultery, what made him flee to Pernambuco once more. Refugiated at the Monastery of S\u00e3o Bento, he wrote his masterpiece Prosopopeia. Another version tells that Teixeira's wife accused him of being Jewish. After being interrogated and absolved in 1589, he was intimated by the caller of the Portuguese Inquisition, and Teixeira then confessed that he was a follower of the Judaism. Enraged by his wife's delation, he murdered her and fled to the aforementioned monastery. However, he was found, arrested and sent to Lisbon in 1595(?), staying there until his death. ==Works== Many works were attributed to Teixeira, such as: * Rela\u00e7\u00f5es do Naufr\u00e1gio: According to studies made by Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen, it was written by Afonso Lu\u00eds, pilot of a carrack named Santo Ant\u00f3nio, mentioned in the poem Prosopopeia. * Di\u00e1logos das Grandezas do Brasil: According to Capistrano de Abreu, it was written by Ambr\u00f3sio Fernandes Brand\u00e3o. The only one whose authorship is confirmed was the epic poem Prosopopeia, written in 1601. The poem, inspired by Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es' Os Lus\u00edadas, tells about the life and works of the then-governor of Pernambuco Jorge de Albuquerque Coelho and his brother Duarte. ==External links== * A sparse poem by Teixeira * * Category:1560s births Category:1610s deaths Category:17th-century Portuguese poets Category:Portuguese male poets Category:Portuguese Jews Category:Portuguese-language writers Category:People from Porto Category:16th-century Portuguese people Category:17th-century Portuguese people Category:16th-century Portuguese writers Category:16th- century male writers Category:17th-century Portuguese writers Category:16th- century Portuguese poets Category:17th-century male writers ",
