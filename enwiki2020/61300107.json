It is a large two-and-a-half-story Georgian Revival-style house with a hipped roof. It \"is distinguished by its symmetrical massing and elaborate moldings. The five- bay central block, flanked by recessed three-bay wings, is centered by a segmentally curved pedimented portico with two fluted Doric columns and a fluted pilaster on each side.\" It was designed by architects Warren-Knight and Davis, Inc., of Birmingham. It was deemed significant for its association with Thomas E. Kilby, who served as Lieutenant Governor of Alabama from 1914 to 1918 and as Governor from 1919 through 1923, and architecturally \"as retaining perhaps the finest Georgian Revival facade remaining in Anniston.\" With It is also a contributing building in the East Anniston Residential Historic District. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Calhoun County, Alabama Category:Georgian Revival architecture in Alabama Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1914 ",
