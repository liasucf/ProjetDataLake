The commission was formed by the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR dated November 2, 1942. The decree stipulated that the task of the ChGK was to \u201ctake full account of the villainous crimes of the Nazis and the damage they caused to Soviet citizens and the socialist state, to establish the identity of the German fascist criminals with the aim of bringing them to trial and severe punishment; unification and coordination of the work already carried out by the Soviet state bodies in this area. \" ==History== The Commission's full ceremonial name was: \"Extraordinary State Commission for Ascertaining and Investigating Crimes Perpetrated by the German-Fascist Invaders and their Accomplices\" (, ChGK). The official aim of this agency included \"punishing for the crimes of the German\u2013fascist aggressors.\" According to its own data, 32,000 regular organization staff took part in the work of ChGK. On top of that, around 7,000,000 Soviet citizens had participated in the collection of materials and evidence. The first 27 reports published by ChGK constituted the majority of Soviet evidentiary material in the Nuremberg process and the trials of Japanese war criminals. The reports appeared in English in the daily publication Soviet War News issued by the Press Department of the Soviet Embassy in London. The first report, Protocol on the plunder by the German\u2013Fascist invaders of Rostov Museum at Pyatigorsk, was published on June 28, 1943Soviet War News, June 28, 1943. No. 597 and the last report, Statement on \"Material Damage caused by the German-Fascist invaders to state enterprises and institutions, collective farms, public bodies and citizens of the U.S.S.R\" was published on September 18, 1945.Soviet War News, September 18, 1945. No. 1257. A complete collection of the original 27 communiqu\u00e9s issued by the commission appears in the Soviet Government publication, Soviet Government Statement on Nazi Atrocities.Soviet Government Statements on Nazi Atrocities, Hutchinson & Co. (Publishers), Ltd, 1946, pp 77-317 === Work of the Commission === The facts of atrocities were to be established by acts on the basis of statements by Soviet citizens, interviews of victims, witnesses, medical examinations and inspection of the crime scene. At the same time, it was necessary to establish the perpetrators of the atrocities - the organizers, instigators, perpetrators, accomplices, their names, the names of military units, institutions, organizations. The acts were to contain as accurate a description of the crimes committed as possible. It was necessary to indicate the surname, name, patronymic and place of residence of citizens certifying the fact of atrocity. All relevant documents were to be attached to the acts - protocols of interviews, statements of citizens, opinions of medical experts, photographs, letters from Soviet people deported to Germany, German documents, etc. Members of the commission and secretariat staff traveled to different republics to help organize the work of local commissions and to monitor their work. They inspected graves and corpses, collected numerous testimonies from witnesses and released prisoners of German prisons and concentration camps, interrogated captured soldiers and officers, studied enemy documents, photographs and other evidence of heinous crimes. In addition, according to most historians, some of the crimes for which the Extraordinary State Commission blamed the German side were in fact committed by Soviet state security agencies. In particular, this concerns the execution of prisoners of war near Katyn (in this case, the members of the Commission simply signed a report prepared in advance by the NKVD ) and the execution of prisoners in Vinnitsa (the investigation report of which, however, was never published. http://web.archive.org/web/20150616025918/http://www.holocaust.kiev.ua/news/jurnal_nodostup/Poulsen.pdf ==Members of the Commission== The decree issued by the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R on 2 November 1942 confirmed the appointment of the following members of the commission: *Nikolay Mikhailovich Shvernik (1888\u20131970) Chairman *Academician Nikolay Nilovitsch Burdenko (1876\u20131946) *Academician Boris Yevgenyevich Vedenyev (1884\u20131946) *Valentina Stepanovna Grizodubova (1910\u20131993) *Andrei Alexandrovich Zhdanov (1896\u20131948) *Nicholas (Yarushevich) - Metropolitan of Kiev and Galicia (1892\u20131961) *Academician Trofim Denisovitch Lysenko (1898\u20131976) *Academician Yevgeni Viktorovich Tarle (1875\u20131955) *Alexei Nikolayevich Tolstoi (1882\u20131945) *Academician Ilya Pavlovich Trainin (1886\u20131949) ==List of Reports submitted at Nuremberg== The Soviet prosecution introduced 31 reports from the Extraordinary State Commission as Exhibits for the prosecution at the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg.Trial of the Major War Criminals before the International Military Tribunal, 1949, Volume XXIV \"Exhibits of the Soviet Prosecution\", pp. 170-186 #USSR-1 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on atrocities in the Stavropol region #USSR-2 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on the destruction of industry, etc. in the Stalino region #USSR-2(a) Report of a special commission on crimes in Stalino #USSR-4 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on causing death by spreading epidemic of typhus #USSR-5 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on the \"Gross-lazarett\" in the town of Slavuta #USSR-6 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on crimes in the Lvov region #USSR-8 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on crimes in Auschwitz Nazi death camps #USSR-7 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on atrocities in Lithuania #USSR-9 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on atrocities in Kiev #USSR-29 Joint Polish and Soviet report of the Extraordinary State Commission #USSR-35 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on losses sustained by State enterprises and establishments #USSR-37 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on crimes in the city of Kupiansk #USSR-38 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on German crimes in the city of Minsk #USSR-39 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on atrocities in Estonia #USSR-40 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission concerning destruction and atrocities in the Pushkin Reservation of the U.S.S.R.
