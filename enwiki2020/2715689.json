It is not actually based on any existing Japanese folklore, but rather incorporates elements of Chinese and Japanese folklore and mythology into a new myth. == Unreleased works == *The Sandman Presents: Marquee Moon (One- shot, 1997), a one-shot comic-book written by Peter Hogan, author of The Sandman Presents: Love Street. The first intended story arc in the Sandman Presents series, Marquee Moon would have taken place in 1977, featuring the mother of a werewolf character from The Sandman, as well as John Constantine from Hellblazer. It would also have featured the comic-book debut of The Clash. For reasons never made public, Vertigo opted not to publish the story after it had already been written, fully illustrated and solicited. Therefore, in 2007, Hogan allowed Rich Handley, owner of the Web site Roots of the Swamp Thing, to post the script and complete artwork online, though as of 2014 this website is offline. == See also == *Characters of The Sandman ==References== *Unofficial Vertigo Comics Index.
