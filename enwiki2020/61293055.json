    "text": "Enscape is a commercial real-time rendering and virtual reality plugin. It is mainly used in the architecture, engineering, and construction fields and is developed and maintained by Enscape GmbH, founded in 2013 and based in Karlsruhe, Germany. == Overview == The main focus of Enscape lies in the calculation of realistic visualizations of architecture with low operating complexity. A real-time method is applied to achieve higher iteration speeds at the planning project by reducing waiting times. The respective CAD model is used, for example, to derive a virtual reality simulation. Enscape uses OpenGL 4.3 and Vulkan and provides photorealistic representations of the underlying CAD models. With the help of a path-tracing procedure and physically based material models, the global illumination can be visualized realistically. The following design solutions are currently supported: * Revit * SketchUp * Rhinoceros 3D * ArchiCAD * Vectorworks == Special Features of the Renderer == * Enscape is based on the self-developed renderer optimized for architectural visualization * GPU controlled rendering technologies are used to display all architectural project sizes without loss of detail (e.g. by LOD [level of detail]) * Hybrid ray tracing to simulate physically correct indirect lighting and reflection, combining image-based screen space techniques with BVH based global data structures * Global lighting calculations can thus be performed very quickly and largely independently of the complexity of the project == References == == Further reading == * Eric Haines, Tomas Akenine-M\u00f6ller: Ray Tracing Gems, Apress, Berkeley, CA (2019), Website * John G.
