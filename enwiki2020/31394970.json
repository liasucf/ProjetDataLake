    "text": "Mikl\u00f3s Simonovits (4 September 1943 in Budapest) is a Hungarian mathematician who currently works at the R\u00e9nyi Institute of Mathematics in Budapest and is a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He is on the advisory board of the journal Combinatorica. He is best known for his work in extremal graph theory and was awarded Sz\u00e9chenyi Prize in 2014. Among other things, he discovered the method of progressive induction which he used to describe graphs which do not contain a predetermined graph and the number of edges is close to maximal. With Lov\u00e1sz, he gave a randomized algorithm using O(n7 log2 n) separation calls to approximate the volume of a convex body within a fixed relative error. Simonovits was also one of the most frequent collaborators with Paul Erd\u0151s, co-authoring 21 papers with him. == Career == He began his university studies at the Mathematics department of E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in 1962, after winning a silver and bronze medal at the International Mathematics Olympiad in 1961 and 1962 respectively. He got his diploma in mathematics from the university in 1967 and defended his PhD under Vera T. S\u00f3s in 1971. He taught as an assistant professor and then associate professor at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd, from 1971 to 1979, mainly combinatorics and analysis. He joined Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi Institute of Mathematics in 1979. In the coming years, he was appointed as the professor in Discrete mathematics. He was also a visiting professor at a number of foreign institutions in US and Canada. He was also a visiting researcher at Moscow State University, Charles University, Prague, Warsaw University, Denmark and various institutions in India. He was elected as a corresponding member at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 2001 and full membership was awarded in 2008. == Academic work == His main research interests are Combinatorics, Extremal Graph Theory, Theoretical Computer Science and Random Graphs. He discovered the method of progressive induction which he used to describe graphs which do not contain a predetermined graph and the number of edges is close to maximal. With Laszlo Lov\u00e1sz, he gave a randomized algorithm using O(n7 log2 n) separation calls to approximate the volume of a convex body within a fixed relative error. He is a long-time collaborator of Endre Szemeredi and worked with him closely. Simonovits was also one of the most frequent collaborators with Paul Erd\u0151s, co-authoring 21 papers with him. == Family == His father Simonovits Istv\u00e1n (1907\u20131985) was a doctor and a hematologist. He was a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Beke Anna, his mother, was a mathematics and physics teacher, who also worked in a book publishing company. == Awards == * Tibor Szele-Medal (1989) * Academy Award (1993) * Sz\u00e9chenyi-Prize (2014) == Key publications == * A limit theorem in graph theory (with Erd\u0151s P\u00e1l, 1966) * Anti-Ramsey theorems (coauthor, 1973) * On the Structure of Edge Graphs-2 (coauthor, 1976) * Spanning Retracts of a Partially Ordered Set (coauthor, 1980) * Compactness Results in Extremal Graph-Theory (with Erd\u0151s P\u00e1l, 1982) * Supersaturated Graphs and Hypergraphs (with Erd\u0151s P\u00e1l, 1983) * On Restricted Colorings of K_n (with T.
