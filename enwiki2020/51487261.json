Stanley was acquitted on February 9, 2018. The verdict by the all-white jury gained national media attention, and resulted in rallies and vigils in locations such as Saskatoon, Battleford Winnipeg, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Toronto, and Ottawa. Clint Wuttunee, Chief of the Red Pheasant First Nation, challenged the jury selection process. Scott Spencer, the defence attorney, explained that said there was a lack of evidence proving Stanley's intent to kill Boushie. Saskatoon mayor Charlie Clark said the case was a \"defining moment for this community and this country\". ==References== Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Judges in Saskatchewan Category:People from Saskatchewan ",
