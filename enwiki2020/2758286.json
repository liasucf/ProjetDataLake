    "text": "The N28 road is a national primary road in Ireland. It connects the port and village of Ringaskiddy to Cork city. The road leaves Cork from an interchange on the N40 Cork South Ring Road near Douglas. It runs southwards towards Carrigaline, joining the Carrigaline Road. North of Carrigaline the route leaves the Shannonpark Roundabout and proceeds east through the village of Shanbally to Ringaskiddy. Prior to the completion of the South Ring the N28 formed the route from the Bandon Road interchange through the Kinsale Road interchange to where it presently leaves the N40 ring road. As of 2019, 11 km of motorway is being planned on the N28 between Cork and Ringaskiddy, with a final 1.5 km of single carriageway. It is uncertain when this will commence. ==See also== *Roads in Ireland *Motorways in Ireland *National secondary road *Regional road ==References== *Roads Act 1993 (Classification of National Roads) Order 2006 \u2013 Department of Transport 28 Category:Roads in County Cork ",
