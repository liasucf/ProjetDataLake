The airport hosts Allegiant Air flights to three airports - Phoenix/Mesa Gateway Airport, Los Angeles International Airport and Tucson International Airport. ==Overview== Terminal in July, 2017 The airport has rarely had scheduled airline flights. In June 2011 Frontier Airlines began daily flights to Denver. Salt Lake City International Airport (about north) is the closest airport with numerous flights. (SkyWest Airlines flew to Provo in 1974-1975.) Frontier's flights to Denver ended in January 2013. Allegiant Air began flights to Phoenix/Mesa in February 2013, and in March 2013 announced twice- weekly flights to Oakland International Airport beginning June 7, 2013. On July 4, 2013, it was announced that Allegiant Air would begin flying to Los Angeles International Airport beginning September 26, 2013. In June 2016, Allegiant Air announced it would begin flying to San Diego International Airport beginning September 28, 2016. Service to Oakland and San Diego was suspended in 2018. Service to Tucson International Airport began on Nov 16, 2018. In August 2020, Allegiant Air announced it would begin flying to Denver International Airport beginning November 19, 2020. The airport has one fixed- base operator and is frequently used for flight training and is home to flight schools, including one operated by Utah Valley University. In the last 6 months of 2011, the airport had 14,858 enplanements. ==History== The airport's Air Traffic Control Tower opened in 2005; previously, the airport was uncontrolled. When the control tower opened, the nearby airspace became Class D airspace over a radius of around the airport and up to MSL (2500 feet AGL), with a circular cutout in the southern portion surrounding nearby Spanish Fork-Springville Airport, which is not Class D. In anticipation of airline service, a new terminal area was built in early 2011 to house Transportation Security Administration equipment for passenger screening. As of August 2012, a millimeter wave full body scanner is in use. In November 2019, the airport broke ground on a new $40 million terminal. The new terminal will have 4 gates initially with future expansion to 10 gates in total. The terminal is expected to be completed in December 2021, with a full shift to the new terminal and gates inearly 2022.https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2019/11/06/provo- airport-launches/ ==Facilities== Provo Municipal Airport covers and has two runways: * 13/31: Asphalt * 18/36: Asphalt ==Airline and destinations== {| class=\"collapsible collapsed\" style=\"border:1px #aaa solid; width:50em; margin:0.2em auto\" |- !
