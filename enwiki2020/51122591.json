    "text": "Krabat Rabe in Schwarzkollm. Krabat is a character in Sorbian folklore, also dubbed the \"Wendish Faust\". First recorded in 1837, Joachim Leopold Haupt, Von einem b\u00f6sen Herrn in Gro\u00df-S\u00e4rchen (1837) the character developed from an evil sorcerer into a folk hero and beneficial trickster in the course of the 19th century. ==Origins== The historical nucleus of the folk tale is Johannes Schadowitz (1624-1704), a Croat (Crabat) cavalry commander, who was granted an estate in Gro\u00df S\u00e4rchen (now part of Lohsa) near Hoyerswerda in 1691 by John George III, Elector of Saxony. ==Analysis== The tale of Krabat's apprenticeship to an evil sorcerer with malefic powers can be classified, in folkloristic studies, as Aarne-Thompson-Uther ATU 325, \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\". ==Distribution== The folk tale is centered around the area of Lusatia, most notably the settlement of \u010corny Cho\u0142mc, which today is a district of the city of Hoyerswerda, where Krabat is said to have learned his sorcerous powers.* pp. 323-348. ==Adaptations== The Krabat story has been adapted into several novels, notably: * Mi\u0161ter Krabat (Master Krabat) (1954) by M\u011br\u0107in Nowak-Njechor\u0144ski. * \u010corny m\u0142yn (The Black Mill) (1968) by Jurij Br\u011bzan, on which the film Die Schwarze M\u00fchle was based. * Krabat (1971) by Otfried Preu\u00dfler, which inspired The East German TV Movie Die schwarze M\u00fchle (1975), the Czech film \u010carod\u011bj\u016fv u\u010de\u0148 (1977) and the German film Krabat (2008). The Krabat album by German Goth band ASP is also inspired by this version of the legend. ==References== ==Bibliography== *Jurij Pilk, Adolf Anders, \"Der wendische Faust\", S\u00e4chsischer Erz\u00e4hler.
