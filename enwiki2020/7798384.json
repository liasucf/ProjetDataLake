    "text": "The Yellow Thing is a double-hulled floating vessel (like a catamaran), used by Greenpeace to sample marine debris. As of 2006, its primary mission is to be used as a trawl for plastic samples in areas such as the Mediterranean Sea and the North Pacific Gyre. It is not self-powered, rather it is towed via a ship-attached boom (as of 3-2006, it was being used on the MV Esperanza). It is also considered to be relatively stable as a marine vehicle. ==References== *\"What is the Yellow Thing?\" *Reuters report on Greenpeace trawling study Category:Individual catamarans Category:Ships of Greenpeace ",
