It also awards grants to German students, doctoral students, and scholars for studies and research abroad.

The declared aim of the program was to create \"a select elite among Syria's future leadership\" for \"active participation in organizing\" post-war Syria. In the initial stage of the program, 271 Syrians seen as suitable for university scholarships were chosen from potential candidates who were \"either still living in Syria or in one of the bordering countries (Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey), or who had fled to Germany\". The former were then brought to Germany to join those participants who were already there. The scholarships were to various universities throughout Germany. The German Foreign Office funded the bulk of the scholarships (200) with the balance being sponsored by Baden Wurttemberg (50) and North Rhine Westphalia (21). The scholarship curriculum included an introductory language course for those students who were not already fluent in, or otherwise had no prior knowledge of, German. Alongside this was a concomitant obligatory element intended to imbue the planned future Syrian elite with the \"fundamental and practical knowledge and skills in political sciences, economics, social sciences, as well as operational competence.\" ==See also== * Franco-German University * List of Nobel laureates ==External links== *DAAD Homepage ==References== Category:Academic transfer Category:Government scholarships Category:Organizations established in 1925 Category:Higher education in Germany Category:Educational foundations Category:Foundations based in Germany Category:Organisations based in Bonn Category:Study abroad programs Category:Social engineering (political science) Category:German involvement in the Syrian Civil War ",
