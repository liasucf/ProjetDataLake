He served as spokesman on energy for the Alliance 90/The Greens parliamentary group, a member of the Environmental Protection Committee, substitute member of the Committee on Economics and Technology and substitute member of the Defence Committee. Together with Hermann Scheer, he authored the 2000 draft of the Renewable Energy Sources Act, establishing the foundation for the technology developments in photovoltaic, biogas, wind power and geothermal energy in Germany. Fell is founder and president of the Energy Watch Group and an internationally renowned energy and climate change advisor, author and speaker. ==Personal life== Hans-Josef Fell was born on 7 January 1952 in Hammelburg, Germany.

After passing the state teacher's exam in 1980, Fell began teaching physics and physical education at Alexander-von-Humboldt Gymnasium in Schweinfurt. Fell and his wife live in Hammelburg and have three children. The family house is built according to ecological criteria and runs completely on renewable energy. Fell has won awards for his home, including the international \"Solar-Oskar\", the Energy Globe Award 2000. In 2015, he received The Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for his continuous support of the German Energiewende. ==Political career== Hans-Josef Fell joined the Green Party in 1992 following years of interest in renewable energy and environmental protection.

Hans-Josef Fell wrote the draft of the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG), which was adopted in 2000 in the face of strong political opposition. The law, enacted 25 February 2000, guarantees cost-covering feed-in tariffs for electricity from biomass, wind power, and solar power, and aimed to increase the percentage of renewable energy used in Germany to 12.5% by the year 2010 and 20% by 2020. In 2011, Germany was already generating 20% of its energy from renewable resources. He was also involved in drafting the law amending the EEG in 2004.
