She then became editor in chief of Red, owned by Hachette, and a sister magazine to Elle. She resigned from Red in 2013, shortly after Hachette's magazines in the UK were acquired by Hearst. She took a year out researching the future of women's media and launched the website The Pool in 2015, with co-founder Lauren Laverne. The Pool was described by J. Walter Thompson intelligence at Cannes Lions 2015 as \"A new vision of women's media that goes beyond the glossy.\" The website entered administration in January 2019. Baker was born in Hampshire, and studied politics at Birmingham University. She went on to work as a writer and editor for numerous British women's magazines, including Red, New Woman, Chat, and Take a Break. After re- launching teenage magazine Just Seventeen as J-17, she spent five years as editor of UK women's magazine Company, before resigning to write her first novel, Fashion Victim (described by Time as one of the five break-through first novels of the summer of 2005). Her second novel, This Year's Model, was published by Random House in the US, and Orion in the UK. Her third novel The Stepmothers Support Group was published by HarperCollins in 2009 (The Other Mothers Club / Avon / 2010 in the US). Her fourth novel, To My Best Friends, was published by Harper in May 2011. In Spring 2016 she published The Woman Who Ran, HarperCollins, a critically acclaimed reworking of Anne Bront\u00eb's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, described by Marian Keyes as, \u2018Wildly gripping and unputdownable. This is a brilliant book.' Baker also broadcasts on young women's issues. She lives in Winchester, Hampshire, and Paris with her partner, the novelist Jon Courtenay Grimwood. Baker has stated her life philosophy as follows: \"If someone says you can't, prove them wrong. Fight your own battles and admit your mistakes.\" ==Works== * * * * * ==References== ==External links== * Category:British magazine editors Category:Living people Category:1966 births Category:Alumni of the University of Birmingham ",
