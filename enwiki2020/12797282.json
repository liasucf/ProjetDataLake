It was his first with the E Street Band since The Rising in 2002. The album ranked number two on Rolling Stone's list of the Top 50 Albums of 2007.ROBERT CHRISTGAU, DAVID FRICKE, CHRISTIAN HOARD, ROB SHEFFIELD (December 17, 2007). \"The Top 50 Albums of 2007\" Rolling Stone. Retrieved 2007-12-20 ==Background== Magic was announced on August 16, 2007, following months of fevered recording speculation and weeks of equally fevered release speculation among the Springsteen faithful.\"Bruce Springsteen's 'Magic' Set for October 2 Release on Columbia Records\", Shore Fire Media press release, August 16, 2007. Accessed August 16, 2007. Of the album's tracks, \"Long Walk Home\" had been previously heard once, late on the 2006 Sessions Band Tour; the rest were new. Most of those were written by the end of 2006;Larry McShane, \"Springsteen, E Street Band to reunite for a bit of 'Magic\u2019\", Associated Press, August 16, 2007. Accessed August 16, 2007.

Accessed August 18, 2007. Recording began at Southern Tracks Recording Studio in Atlanta over a period of two months beginning March 2007. It was complicated by the band members' schedules, and especially drummer Max Weinberg's weekday commitments to taping Late Night with Conan O'Brien. The band did not record as a unit:\"Dates are set; Bruce revs up E Street Machine for Fall\", Backstreets.com, August 28, 2007. Accessed August 28, 2007. rather, during the week Springsteen worked on vocal tracks and production; on weekends the core band of Weinberg, bassist Garry Tallent, and pianist Roy Bittan flew down to record the basic tracks with Springsteen. Then periodically the other band members were called in as needed to overdub their parts under producer O'Brien's watch. Only saxophonist and longtime foil Clarence Clemons was given different treatment, with O'Brien handing the studio over to Springsteen for recording of sax parts due to \"a whole dynamic [between the two of them] that spans decades.\" Upon its announcement, Magic was characterized by Springsteen's manager Jon Landau as a \"high energy rock\" album, with a \"heavy E Street Band\" sound. The initial track, \"Radio Nowhere\", was slated as the album's first single,Andy Greene, \"Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u2018Magic\u2019: Exclusive Details on New E Street Band Album\", Rolling Stone, August 16, 2007. Accessed August 16, 2007. for release to radio on September 4, 2007; however, it leaked to the Internet on August 22, 2007. The release of the CD form of the album on October 2, 2007 was preceded by a September 25, 2007 release on vinyl record, in order to qualify the album for the Grammy Awards of 2008 before the end-of- September cutoff.Jonathan Cohen, \"Billboard Bits: Bruce Springsteen\", Billboard, August 23, 2007.

O. Scott of The New York Times notes that not even this track is \"untouched by melancholy. Its narrator, after all, stands and watches as the girls of the title 'pass me by.'\"Scott, A. O.

Several sources have postulated that the track \"Last to Die\", with its chorus of \"Who'll be the last to die for a mistake/Whose blood will spill, whose heart will break\", was inspired by Vietnam Veterans Against the War representative (and future senator and presidential candidate) John Kerry's 1971 testimony to the U.S. Senate, in which he asked \"How do you ask a man to be the last man to die in Vietnam? How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?\".Quillen, Shay. Springsteen's 'Magic' ends with a political wallop, The San Jose Mercury News, October 6, 2007. Accessed November 5, 2007. \"Gypsy Biker\" concerns the homecoming of a US soldier killed in action in Iraq, and Springsteen has said that \"Livin' in the Future\" references extraordinary rendition and illegal wiretapping. \"Long Walk Home\" is a metaphorical account of the narrator's sense that, in the artist's words, those people living at home \"he thought he knew, whose ideals he had something in common with, are like strangers.\" ==Release and reception== Magic received highly positive reviews and was Springsteen's seventh number one in the UK, with first week sales of 77,692, making it his fastest-starting release of the 21st century. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, becoming Springsteen's eighth #1 album in the US and selling about 335,000 copies in its first week.Katie Hasty, \"Springsteen Is Boss Of Album Chart With 'Magic'\", Billboard.com, October 10, 2007.

The sales Magic gained in the US were achieved despite its receiving very little radio airplay. Fox News reported that media conglomerate Clear Channel had instructed its classic rock format stations not to play any tracks from Magic, even though they continued to play Springsteen songs from the 1970s and '80s. Clear Channel responded by saying that \"in the first days after the CD's release,\" its stations played the record more than other stations did. By January 2009, Magic had sold one million copies in the US. ==Track listing== Two weeks after the album's initial announcement, which included an eleven-song track listing, \"Terry's Song\" was added. It is a memorial song for Springsteen's long-time assistant Terry Magovern, who died on July 30, 2007.Levine, Stuart.
