    "text": "Ultimate Sinatra is a 2015 compilation album by American singer Frank Sinatra released specifically to commemorate the 100-year anniversary of his birth. The collection consists of songs recorded from 1939 to 1979 during his sessions for Columbia Records, Capitol Records, and Reprise Records. The 4-CD set consists of 100 songs, plus a never before released bonus track of a rehearsal recording of \"The Surrey With the Fringe On Top\" from the musical Oklahoma! This edition also features an 80-page booklet with a new essay by Sinatra historian and author Charles Pignone, as well as rare photos and quotes from Sinatra, his family members and key collaborators. A single-disc version also was released, consisting of 24 tracks from the box set plus an exclusive alternate studio take of \"Just In Time.\" The Australian 2-CD edition adds a complete, previously unreleased recording of Sinatra's December 1961 concert at Sydney Stadium. The American release truncates the Sydney show. ==Track listing== Box set edition (Note: all composers' and arrangers' names listed below are in the order they appear in the box set booklet. \"Arranged by\" is abbreviated as \"arr. by\" below.) ===Disc one=== #\"All or Nothing at All\" (Jack Lawrence, Arthur Altman)\u2015arr. by Andy Gibson - 2:58 #\"I'll Never Smile Again\" (Ruth Lowe)\u2015arr. by Fred Stulce - 3:10 #\"Street of Dreams\" (from \"The Essential Frank Sinatra and Tommy Dorsey\") (Victor Young, Sam M.
