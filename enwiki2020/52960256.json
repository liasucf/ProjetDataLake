Rabinowitz joined the faculty of Hamilton College in 1974, where she is Margaret Bundy Scott Professor of Comparative Literature. She is an expert on ancient Greek tragedy, feminist theory, and modern literature. Sorkin Rabinowitz is a member of the Society for Classical Studies, the Women's Classical Caucus, and of Lambda (formerly the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Caucus of APA). She contributed to the establishment of the SCS Affiliated Group Classics and Social Justice, in which she is responsible for the Prisons action committee. From 1995 to 2005, she was Director of the Kirkland Project for the Study of Gender, Society, and Culture, at Hamilton College. In 1993, she co-edited together with Amy Richlin one of the first volumes that discussed the importance of opening the field of Classics to the use of Feminist Theory. Having previously collaborated with the Medea Project: Theatre for Incarcerated Women/HIV Circle, which uses arts and education as a form of social activism, she currently contributes to the Hamilton Oneida Prison Education (HOPE) project at Hamilton College, aimed at bringing classical texts and theatre beyond classroom teaching or elitist culture. Her edited collection, From Abortion to Pederasty: Addressing Difficult Topics in the Classics Classroom, coedited with Fiona McHardy, won the inaugural Teaching Literature Book Award in 2015. == Selected bibliography == * Anxiety Veiled: Euripides and the Traffic in Women.
