    "text": "\"Kiss and Make Up\" is a song by English singer Dua Lipa and South Korean girl group Blackpink from the super deluxe edition of the former's eponymous debut studio album, Dua Lipa: Complete Edition (2018). The song was written by Lipa, Chelcee Grimes, Yannick Rastogi, Zacharie Raymond, Mathieu Jomphe-Lepine, Marc Vincent, and Teddy Park, while production was handled by Banx & Ranx. It is a dance, electropop, and reggaeton track, with tropical and EDM tones. Lyrically, the song is about using physical affection instead of words to solve an argument between two lovers. \"Kiss and Make Up\" received generally favourable reviews from music critics, with many praising the compatibility of the two artists' vocals in both Korean and English. Commercially, \"Kiss and Make Up\" became a successful album track, reaching number 36 and 93 respectively on the UK Singles Chart and US Billboard Hot 100. Internationally, the song charted in the top 40 in 19 countries and topped the charts in Malaysia and Singapore. It was later certified platinum and silver respectively in Australia and the United Kingdom. \"Kiss and Make Up\" was included on the set list of Blackpink's In Your Area tour (2018\u20132020). A pop- funk remix of the song appears on Lipa and The Blessed Madonna's remix album Club Future Nostalgia (2020), that samples Herb Alpert's \"Rise\" (1979). ==Writing and production== \"Kiss and Make Up\" was written by Dua Lipa, Chelcee Grimes, Mathieu Jomphe-Lepine, Marc Vincent, Teddy Park, Yannick Rastogi and Zacharie Raymond, with production from the latter two as Banx & Ranx. It was originally written about a year and a half before it was released, as a solo song for Lipa; the song didn't fit her album at the time, and she wanted it be a collaboration so she ultimately left it off the track list for her eponymous debut studio album (2017). After the album's release, Grimes pitched the song to other singers including Demi Lovato, Britney Spears, and Miley Cyrus, but all turned it down thinking the lyrics were too immature. On 6 May 2018, Lipa performed a concert in Seoul as part of her Self-Titled Tour, where Blackpink's Jennie and Lisa were in attendance. Lipa recalled having an \"absolute blast\" with them. Lipa thought \"Kiss and Make Up\" would sound great as a collaboration with Blackpink. Lipa then sent Blackpink the song asking to feature on it, which they accepted. Blackpink went into the studio and translated the lyrics into Korean. The song was recorded at Rollover Studio in the United Kingdom. Mixing was handled by Jamie Snell at The Hamilton in Cheam, while mastering was done by Chris Gehringer at Sterling Sound in New York City. Following the release of her second studio album, Future Nostalgia in March 2020, Lipa intended to create a mixtape with remixes of songs from the record. She enlisted the help of The Blessed Madonna to create what would eventually become the remix album, Club Future Nostalgia (2020). Lipa wanted to somehow include some of her past collaborations and The Blessed Madonna wanted to introduce a younger crowd to the music of American trumpeter Herb Alpert, by creating an extended version of one of his songs. She took the vocals of \"Kiss and Make Up\" and parts of Alpert's \"Rise\" (1979) to create a remix. The Blessed Madonna thought that the two songs were \"totally in key\" and \"a perfect fit.\" Due to the \"Rise\" sample, Andy Armer and Randy Alpert are credited as composers. ==Music and lyrics== \"Kiss and Make Up\" is a rhythmic dance, electropop, and reggaeton song, with tropical and EDM tones. It is composed in the time signature of time in the key of E major, with a tempo of 100 beats per minute and a chord progression of Cm\u2013A\u2013E\u2013B/Gm. The song has a length of three minutes and nine seconds, and features a clubby and incandescent production, consisting of bass synths, a clattering percussion, and a bouncing backbeat. The structure includes a vocodered intro, an early-2010s hook, and a rhythmic chorus. Lipa begins the song, before Jennie raps in the second verse, while Ros\u00e9 handles the pre-chorus. Lipa and Blackpink's vocals range from G3 to C5, singing flirty and assertive lyrics in both English and Korean. Lyrically, the track creates a storyline about using physical affection instead of words to solve issues between two lovers. The Club Future Nostalgia remix of \"Kiss and Make Up\" is a \"rubbery\" pop-funk track that pays homage to the urban roots of remix culture, with a sample of the bass from \"Rise\" by Herb Alpert. Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times compared the remix to Madonna's 1989 song \"Express Yourself\". ==Release and promotion== \"Kiss and Make Up\" was first teased in the music video for Lipa's 2016 single \"Blow Your Mind (Mwah)\", where its title appeared on a sign one of Lipa's friends holds in a pride parade. Lipa announced the song's release on 4 September 2018. It was released for digital download and streaming on 19 October 2018 as the third track on the second disc of the super deluxe edition of Lipa's debut album Dua Lipa: Complete Edition. The song was included on the setlist of Blackpink's In Your Area tour as the eleventh song performed. In Lipa's absence, Ros\u00e9 and Jisoo sang her parts. At the Prudential Center show on 1 May 2019 in Newark, New Jersey, Lipa joined Blackpink to perform the song. A remix of the song is included on Lipa and The Blessed Madonna's Club Future Nostalgia remix album as the fifteenth track, released on 28 August 2020. It was accompanied by an animated visualizer that features a livestream of a mushroom man dancing on a chair. ==Critical reception== \"Kiss and Make Up\" received generally favourable reviews from music critics. Mike Nied of Idolator praised Blackpink's \"commendable performance\" and the song's \"fierce lines.\" For Billboard, Jeff Benjamin labelled it an \"excellently crafted electro-pop throbber,\" while Uproxx's Chloe Gilke called it \"anthemic pop perfection.\" In NME Rhian Daly named it Blackpink's eighth best song, complimenting the mix of \"East meets West,\" that \"elevates the song beyond the typical.\" He concluded by praising Lipa and Blackpink's chemistry, stating the latter's voices \"[bounce] smoothly\" off the former's. Writing for Paper, Emlyn Travis complimented how the English and Korean languages \"weave together\" and declared it \"fits seamlessly\" within both artist's discographies. She concluded by calling it \"undeniably addictive.\" In O, The Oprah Magazine, Monica Chon praised how the two artist's English and Korean vocals work together \"seamlessly,\" while also opining that it makes a \"strong case that language barriers should not be an impediment to enjoying pop music.\" \"Kiss and Make Up\" won Collaboration of the Year at the 2019 BreakTudo Awards. ==Commercial performance== \"Kiss and Make Up\" debuted and peaked at number 36 on the UK Singles Chart issue dated 26 October 2018, and spent a total of 12 weeks on the chart. This made Blackpink the first K-pop girl group to reach the top 40 on the chart. In September 2019, the song was awarded a silver certification in the country by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for track-equivalent sales of 200,000 units. It spent two weeks on the ARIA Singles Chart, where it peaked at number 33 in its first week. The song currently holds a platinum certification in Australia by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for selling 70,000 track-equivalent units. In Asia, the song reached number 90 on the Japan Hot 100, and entered South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart, peaking at number 75. \"Kiss and Make Up\" spent one week on the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 93, becoming Blackpink's second and Lipa's seventh entry on the chart, with first-week sales of 11,000 downloads and seven million on-demand streams. The song additionally entered the top 40 of charts in Austria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Scotland, Slovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland, as well as Malaysia and Singapore, where it reached the summit. It was also awarded respective gold certifications in Italy and Portugal by the Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana (FIMI) and Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Fonogr\u00e1fica Portuguesa (AFP), for respective track-equivalent sales of 25,000 and 5,000 units. ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of Dua Lipa: Complete Edition. ===Recording=== * Recorded at Rollover Studio (United Kingdom) * Mixed at The Hamilton (Cheam, United Kingdom) * Mastered at Sterling Sound (New York City) ===Publishing=== * Published by TaP Music Publishing Limited, Silver Fox Music Ltd / Kobalt Music Copyrights SARL, Lateral MGMT (ASCAP) and YG Entertainment Inc (KOMCA), adm. by Universal Music Publishing * Blackpink appears courtesy of YG Entertainment ===Personnel=== * Dua Lipa vocals * Blackpink (Jennie Kim, Jisoo Kim, Lalisa Manoban, Roseanne Park) vocals * Chelcee Grimes backing vocals * Banx & Ranx (Yannick Rastogi and Zacharie Raymond) production, drums, bass, synths, keys, programming * Yong In Choi engineering * Jamie Snell mixing * Chris Gehringer mastering ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+Weekly chart positions for \"Kiss and Make Up\" |- !
