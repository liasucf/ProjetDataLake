    "text": "Haunt are an American heavy metal band from Fresno, California. The band was originally created as a solo project by Trevor William Church. As such, he is technically the only original member in the lineup. Church is also the sole songwriter and lyricist in the group. == History == Haunt was originally formed by Trevor William Church as a musical project to be worked on alongside his existing band Beastmaker; the project was to take on a traditional metal sound as opposed to Beastmaker's doom metal style. In 2017 Church wrote and recorded Haunt's debut release, the extended play Luminous Eyes, with Daniel Wilson playing drums for the recording. It was first released digitally, as an independent release, but it later received physical releases from the Shadow Kingdom Records label. In 2018, Church wrote and recorded one single for Haunt, Ghosts. Later that same year, Haunt released their first full-length studio album, Burst into Flame. Daniel Wilson returned to play drums for the album, this time as an official band member. Joining Church and Wilson for the album were Matthew Wilhoit on bass and John Tucker on guitar. Both Wilson and Tucker would stay as permanent members, but Wilhoit would be replaced by Taylor Hollman on following releases. In 2019, Haunt released their second EP, (Mosaic Vision) their second studio album, (If Icarus Could Fly) and two split albums. (A Fool's Paradise / On the Streets Again and Sea of Dreams / The Crystal Temple). The following year they released a third album, Mind Freeze, and a compilation, Burst into Demos. Their fourth studio album, Flashback, is set to release in July 2020. == Members == === Current members === * Trevor William Church \u2013 vocals, guitar, bass (2017\u2013present) * Daniel Wilson \u2013 drums (2017\u2013present) * Taylor Hollman \u2013 bass (2018\u2013present) * John Tucker \u2013 guitar (2018\u2013present) === Past members === * Matthew Wilhoit \u2013 bass (2018) == Discography == === Studio Albums === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Title !Released !Record Label |- |Burst into Flame |2018 |Shadow Kingdom Records |- |If Icarus Could Fly |2019 |Independent |- |Mind Freeze |2020 |Shadow Kingdom Records |- |Flashback |2020 |Metal Church Records |} === Extended Plays === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Title !Released !Record Label |- |Luminous Eyes |2017 |Independent |- |Mosaic Vision |2019 |Independent |} === Singles === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Title !Released !Record Label |- |Ghosts |2018 |Decibel |} === Split Albums === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Title !Released !Split With !Record Label |- |A Fool's Paradise / On the Streets Again |2019 |Seven Sisters |Church Recordings |- |Sea of Dreams / The Crystal Temple |2019 |Fortress |Independent |} === Compilations === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Title !Released !Record Label |- |Burst into Demos |2020 |Church Recordings |} ==References== Category:Musical groups established in 2017 Category:American heavy metal musical groups Category:Heavy metal musical groups from California ",
