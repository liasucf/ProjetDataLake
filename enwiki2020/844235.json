Retrieved July 2, 2016. ==Music== ===1979\u20131987: The Gun Club and The Cramps=== After traveling to London and New York City he returned to L.A. and in 1979 met Jeffrey Lee Pierce. Pierce taught him to play guitar using open tuning, and they formed The Creeping Ritual, which became The Gun Club. Powers left that group before their recording debut, instead joining New York-based band The Cramps in December 1980. Powers rejoined the Gun Club briefly in 1983, touring with Pierce's band in Australia the following year, and then again between 1985 and 1988. ===1986\u20131996: Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds, and The Gun Club=== Powers joined Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds in Berlin, Germany, September 1986 for several albums and corresponding tours. Powers recorded the Tender Prey and The Good Son albums with Cave and his band, and he said in early 2015 that he \"loved\" the \"primaeval element of rock'n'roll\" that they had a firm grasp of. During April 1990, it was amicably decided with Nick Cave that he leave The Bad Seeds and concentrate on The Gun Club band that he had reconvened with Jeffery Lee Pierce during downtime in 1989. ===1997\u20132009: JLP tribute albums, The Pink Monkey Birds and Dracula Boots=== For his next project, The Pink Monkey Birds, Powers initially collaborated with New York City guitarist Jack Martin, who he has also collaborated with for the Congo Norvell and Knoxville Girls projects. Then, in 2009, Powers recruited Kiki Solis on bass, Ron Miller on drums, and Jesse Roberts on guitar and keyboards. The band moved to In The Red Records and released the much acclaimed debut studio album, Dracula Boots, which was called a \"return to form.\" Dracula Boots was coproduced by Jason Ward and recorded in a former high school gymnasium in Harveyville, Kansas, which is now an artists' retreat called \"The Harveyville Project.\" Dracula Boots consists of numerous genres, including southern soul, 60s Chicano rock, and psychedelic imagery. British magazine N.M.E. wrote: \"In short, on Dracula Boots Kid Congo Powers has once again found the juicy jugular of soul-fired, funked-up rock'n'roll. You'd be foolish not to take a bite.\" ===2010\u2013present: Gorilla Rose=== In 2011, Kid Congo and The Pink Monkey Birds released their second album, Gorilla Rose, which was also on the In The Red Records label. Eamon Carr of The Dublin Evening Herald said of Gorilla Rose, \"Having a working band is paying off. Gorilla Rose elevates seedy go-go weirdness to the level of high art.\" Powers returned to Australia for the first time in 25 years\u2014when he toured with Cave's Bad Seeds project\u2014at the end of January 2015. The band played at Melbourne's \"Summersalt Festival\" and the Sydney Festival. In a promotional interview for the Australian shows, Powers spoke in regard to his new band: > I think the Pink Monkey Birds conjures up all the best aspects of primal > rock'n'roll ... Lyrically, I'm speaking in images, and from a very skewed > viewpoint, whatever the subject may be. I still have the passion and the > incentive to make music that's different, but still within the confines of a > punk rock language people will know and understand. The Pink Monkey Birds, whose name Kid credits to inspiration from David Bowie, has been an evolving unit since their earliest albums, and as of 2016 the touring members are bassist Kiki Solis, drummer Ron Miller, and guitarist Mark Cisneros. Kid Congo Powers was profiled by Vogue in late April 2016 while promoting their fourth album, where he was noted for his iconic sense of punk style. In his Vogue interview he mentions the aesthetic importance of tying the look of the band to match the music. > For me, the whole art of being a band\u2014and I do think it's an art\u2014is to > create a whole world, a whole language, that is every aspect. The Gun Club, > we kind of made it up as we went along, but what I learned from The Cramps > and Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds is that they created a whole uncompromising > world, and it's all kind of sprung out of that. You want to communicate with > people, and I think through all aesthetics\u2014artwork, the look, and music\u2014you > get to keep your world, and you get to let people enter your world and live > in your world with you. ==Personal life== Kid Congo Powers is openly gay and is married. During the 1980s, he was involved with the ACT UP advocacy group. ==Selected discography== *1981 The Cramps \u2013 Psychedelic Jungle *1984 The Cramps \u2013 Smell of Female *1984 The Gun Club \u2013 The Las Vegas Story *1987 The Gun Club \u2013 Mother Juno *1990 The Gun Club \u2013 Pastoral Hide and Seek *1991 The Gun Club \u2013 Divinity EP *1985 The Fur Bible EP *1988 Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds \u2013 Tender Prey *1990 Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds \u2013 The Good Son *1988 Barry Adamson \u2013 Moss Side Story *1998 Mark Eitzel \u2013 Caught in a Trap and I Can't Back Out 'Cause I Love You Too Much, Baby *2005 Kid Congo Powers \u2013 Solo Cholo *2006 Kid Congo and the Pink Monkey Birds \u2013 Philosophy and Underwear *2006 Madrugada \u2013 Live at Oslo Spektrum [DVD] *2009 Kid Congo and The Pink Monkey Birds \u2013 Dracula Boots *2011 Kid Congo and The Pink Monkey Birds \u2013 Gorilla Rose *2013 Kid Congo and The Pink Monkey Birds \u2013 Haunted Head *2016 Kid Congo and The Pink Monkey Birds \u2013 La Ara\u00f1a Es La Vida ==References== ==External links== *Official website *New York Night Train profile page *2013 Rocker Magazine interview \u2013 video and print Category:American indie rock musicians Category:American blues guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:American rock guitarists Category:Punk blues musicians Category:The Cramps members Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:American musicians of Mexican descent Category:LGBT musicians from the United States Category:LGBT people from California Category:LGBT Hispanic and Latino American people Category:Musicians from Los Angeles County, California Category:People from La Puente, California Category:20th-century American musicians Category:21st- century American musicians Category:Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds members Category:Guitarists from California Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:21st-century American guitarists Category:Hispanic and Latino American musicians Category:In the Red artists Category:Mute Records artists ",
