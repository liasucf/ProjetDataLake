    "text": "Free energy suppression (or new energy suppression) is a conspiracy theory that technologically viable, pollution-free, no-cost energy sources are being suppressed by government, corporations, or advocacy groups. Devices allegedly suppressed include perpetual motion machines, cold fusion generators, torus- based generators, reverse-engineered extraterrestrial technology, anti-gravity propulsion systems, and other generally unproven, low-cost energy sources. The alleged suppression (or weakening) is claimed to have occurred since the mid-19th century and allegedly perpetrated by various government agencies, corporate powers, special interest groups, and fraudulent inventors. The special interest groups are usually claimed to be associated with the fossil fuel or nuclear industry, whose business model would be threatened. Claims of suppression include: * The claim that the scientific community has controlled and suppressed research into alternative avenues of energy generation via the institutions of peer review and academic pressure.Phenomenon Archives: Heavy Watergate, The War Against Cold Fusion. Channel One. (video) * The claim that devices exist which are capable of extracting significant and usable power from pre-existing unconventional energy reservoirs, such as the quantum vacuum zero point energy, for little or no cost, but are being suppressed.David Alison (1994), Another free-energy cover-up?: The Dennis Lee Story, Nexus Magazine, (June\u2013July 1994) * The claim that related patents have been bought up, such as those for 100 mpg carburetors. Some notable people who have been claimed to be suppressed, harassed or killed for their research are Stanley Meyer, Eugene Mallove, Nikola Tesla, and John Kanzius. Notable proponents of the conspiracy theory include Gary McKinnon. ==See also== *Disclosure (ufology) *Gravitational energy *Nordtvedt effect *Zero point energy *Potential cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact *List of topics characterized as pseudoscience ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Alternative energy economy Category:Energy development ",
