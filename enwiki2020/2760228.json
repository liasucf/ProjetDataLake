Opened in 1977, it is the central transit hub for the \u00cele-de-France metropolitan area, connecting three of five RER commuter-rail lines and five of sixteen M\u00e9tro lines. The hub hosts travellers per weekday ( for the RER alone) and platforms separated by up to 800 metres (0.49-mile). It is named after the nearby Place du Ch\u00e2telet public square and the Forum des Halles, a shopping mall. ==Terminology== Station layout showing both RER and M\u00e9tro lines Formally, the name Ch\u00e2telet\u2013Les Halles designates the RER station alone. Informally, it refers to the hub comprising the eponymous RER station (served by lines A, B and D) plus the contiguous Paris M\u00e9tro stations Ch\u00e2telet (served by lines 1, 4, 7, 11 and 14) and Les Halles (served by line 4). For purposes of wayfinding, the massive three station complex is broken up into three sectors: Forum, Rivoli, and Seine. The Forum sector is named after the adjoining Forum des Halles shopping mall, which is accessible from this part of the station. The sector includes the RER platforms and the Les Halles station on Paris M\u00e9tro Line 4. Exits numbered 1 through 9 are located in the sector. The Rivoli sector is below and named after the Rue de Rivoli, a major road known for its shopping and includes the Ch\u00e2telet station of lines 1, 4, and 14 of the Paris M\u00e9tro. Exits numbered 10 through 14 are located in the sector. The Seine sector is named after the nearby Seine river and includes the Ch\u00e2telet station of lines 7 and 11 of the Paris M\u00e9tro. Exits numbered 15 through 19 are located in the sector. ==RER station layout== The tracks of the three RER lines are all oriented parallel in an east\u2013west direction. The seven tracks are grouped on four platforms, with the outer platforms reserved for Lines A and B and the central ones for Line D. This enables easy cross-platform connections between RER A and RER B trains traveling in the same direction, and a solution for those RER D trains which use the station as a terminus. {| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 valign=top|G |style=\"border- top:solid 1px gray;\" width=80 valign=top|Street Level |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=525 valign=top|Exit/Entrance |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray; border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 valign=top|B1 |style=\"border- top:solid 1px gray; border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=80 valign=top|Mezzanine |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray; border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=525 valign=top|to Exits/Entrances, connections to |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 rowspan=11 valign=top|Platforms (B2) |Track 1A | toward Boissy-Saint-L\u00e9ger or Marne-la- Vall\u00e9e\u2013Chessy \u2192 |- |style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text- align:center;\" colspan=2| |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Track 1B |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"| toward Robinson or Saint-R\u00e9my-l\u00e8s- Chevreuse \u2192 |- |Track 3 | toward Melun or Malesherbes \u2192 |- |style=\"border- top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2| |- |Track Z | Terminating trains |- |style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text- align:center;\" colspan=2| |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Track 4 |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|\u2190 toward Creil |- |Track 2B |\u2190 toward A\u00e9roport Charles de Gaulle 2 TGV or Mitry\u2013Claye |- |style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border- bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2| |- |style=\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Track 2A |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|\u2190 toward Saint Germain-en-Laye, Cergy-le-Haut or Poissy |- |} ==Renovation== A major renovation of the station complex and adjoining Forum des Halles shopping mall was completed in 2018, with the main aim of improving safety in the event of an emergency evacuation at peak traffic time. The renovation included the construction of a major new entrance at Place Marguerite de Navarre, with direct access to the RER station hall; the complete renovation and enlargement of the RER station hall; and extension of key escalators to lower levels of the station. ==See also== *List of stations of the Paris M\u00e9tro *List of stations of the Paris RER ==References== Category:R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional stations Category:Railway stations in France opened in 1977 Category:Buildings and structures in the 1st arrondissement of Paris ",
