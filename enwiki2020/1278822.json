Soucy has written four novels. His first two, L'Immacul\u00e9e conception (translated as The Immaculate Conception by Lazer Lederhendler) and L'Acquittement (translated as Atonement by Sheila Fischman) are extraordinary, dark and baroque works. His third novel, La petite fille qui aimait trop les allumettes (translated as The Little Girl Who Was Too Fond of Matches by Fischman) caused a sensation in Quebec and was immediately translated into more than ten languages. His fourth novel, Music-Hall!, was published in 2002, and translated as Vaudeville! by Fischman. La petite fille qui aimait trop les allumettes was chosen for inclusion in the French version of Canada Reads, broadcast on Radio-Canada in 2004, where it was defended by actor, film director, screenwriter, and musician Micheline Lanct\u00f4t.
