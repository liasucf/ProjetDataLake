Based on 2010 United States Census Map of Massachusetts House of Representatives districts for Suffolk County, apportioned in 2011 Massachusetts House of Representatives' 12th Suffolk district in the United States is one of 160 legislative districts included in the lower house of the Massachusetts General Court. It covers part of Milton in Norfolk County and part of Boston in Suffolk County. Democrat Dan Cullinane of Dorchester has represented the district since 2013. In 2020 Cullinane opted not to run for re-election. There are three candidates running in the 2020 Democratic primary: Stephanie Everett, Brandy Fluker-Oakley, and Jovan Lacet. The field formerly included Cam Charbonnier, who will appear on the primary ballot but dropped out of the race in July, endorsing Everett for the seat. The current district geographic boundary overlaps with those of the Massachusetts Senate's Norfolk, Bristol and Plymouth district and 1st Suffolk district. ==Representatives== * Thomas Leavitt, circa 1858 * Benjamin Lewis, circa 1858-1859 * Edward Young, circa 1858 * Daniel Hall, circa 1859 * Judah Sears, circa 1859 * Denis J.
