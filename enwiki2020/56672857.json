    "text": "Yamba is a locality in the eastern Riverland of South Australia. It is the last place in South Australia on the Sturt Highway before crossing into Victoria. It is the site of a permanent fruit fly inspection checkpoint, and a large advertisement in the shape of an arc of a vehicle tyre spanning the road. Yamba was previously served by a station on the Barmera railway line. ==Fruit fly checkpoint== On the westward journey, Yamba is the first place in South Australia on the Sturt Highway, and is usually a mandatory stop at the fruit fly biosecurity checkpoint as fruit is not permitted to be carried into South Australia to preserve the state's fruit-fly-free status. The checkpoint has operated since 1957, when it was quickly established in response to a fruit fly outbreak at Mildura. The primary threat on this route is Queensland fruit fly. ==References== Category:Towns in South Australia ",
