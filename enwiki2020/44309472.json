Like the G-5 and the unflown G-4, it was a single seat monoplane, though its , five cylinder Walter NZ-60 radial engine gave it considerably more power. Its structural design was repeated in several of Gribovsky's later aircraft. The plywood covered centre section of the low wing was part of the monocoque fuselage and the two spar outer panels were ply covered back to the rear spar. The fuselage was a rounded monocoque with the engine in a streamlined nose, its cylinders exposed for cooling. Its single seat cockpit was set back towards the wing trailing edge. The G-8 had a fixed tail wheel undercarriage with its main wheels on cranked V-strut axles hinged to the centre of the fuselage underside. Each wheel had a faired vertical shock absorber leg to the outer part of the centre section. Like other Gribovsky aircraft, the G-8 was built at the Moscow Aviation School. It was first flown in 1932. In October 1932 it flew a circular, from Moscow via Ryazan, Kazan, Samara. Saratov, Stalingrad, Rostov, Zaporozhye, Feodosiya, Poltava, Kharkiv and back to Moscow, piloted by D. A. Koshnits. ==Specifications== Gribovsky G-8 ==References== Category:1930s Soviet sport aircraft G-08 Category:Low-wing aircraft Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1932 ",
