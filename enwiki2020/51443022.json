    "text": "The Battle at Br\u016fdek (Czech bitva u Br\u016fdku; German Schlacht bei Stokau, Schlacht bei BiwankaStokau, also Stockau, Stokow is the German name of the village called Pivo\u0148 in Czech. Biwanka or Piwonka are German spellings of Czech Pivo\u0148ka, now the name of a minor river rising near Pivo\u0148, a tributary of \u010cern\u00fd potok, in turn a tributary of Radbuza. Ign\u00e1c Cornova, Briefe an einen kleinen Liebhaber der Vaterl\u00e4ndischen Geschichte: Geschichte B\u00f6hmens unter dem Pr\u017eemislischen Herrscherstamm (1796), p. 68.) was a battle fought between Henry III, King of the Romans, and B\u0159etislav I, Duke of Bohemia, on 22/23 August 1040. The battle took place in the Upper Palatine Forest in what is now the Doma\u017elice District of Plze\u0148 Region, Czech Republic.the site associated with the battle in Czech tradition, Br\u016fdek in V\u0161eruby (Doma\u017elice District) municipality, at V\u0161erubsk\u00fd pr\u016fsmyk (Neumarker Pass), is some 20 km to the east-southeast of Stockau (Pivo\u0148, Mnichov municipality) given as the site in 18th-century German tradition. As this was not a single field battle but a series of clashes between separate contingents of the two armies taking place over the span of two days, the two locations are not mutually exclusive. B\u0159etislav was leading a campaign against Poland in 1039, and after he conquered Gniezno, he removed the relics of Adalbert of Prague to Prague, intended as a move to establish a separate archbishopric there, in order to secede from the jurisdiction of the archbishop of Mainz. Archbishop Bardo complained about this to Henry, who was already unhappy with B\u0159etislav's war against Poland, as both Bohemia and Poland were nominally vassals of the empire. B\u0159etislav agreed to send his son Spytihn\u011bv as a hostage to the court of the king, however because he refused the payment of a tribute requested by Henry, the king moved against Bohemia with two armies. B\u0159etislav had won a respite by offering his son as hostage, which he used to gain the support of Peter, King of Hungary, who sent 3,000 support troops. B\u0159etislav also fortified the passes of the Bohemian Forest and intended to ambush Henry, who was anticipating the attack and moved in several detachments. When Henry located the intended ambush, he sent a vanguard of 1,000 men into a side valley of the Chamb in order to enclose the enemy. This vanguard, led by Werner I of Maden, count of Winterthur, the bearer of the imperial banner, was caught up in the prepared sconces and almost completely destroyed. Henry's second wing, led by margrave Otto of Schweinfurt, was forced to retreat with heavy losses the following day. Henry was forced to retreat, and sent Gunther of Bohemia with orders to Eckard II, Margrave of Meissen, who was leading a Saxon force invading Bohemia from the north, to do likewise. Eckard negotiated a retreat some two weeks after. Henry requested a truce, but was answered with the demand for unconditional surrender, so the king planned a second campaign for the following year. This turned out to be more successful, Henry succeeded in meeting with the Saxon forces before Prague on 8 September and B\u0159etislav was forced to surrender on 29 September 1041. An inscription found in the church at Valt\u00ed\u0159ov, Nov\u00fd Kramol\u00edn mentions Henry III as founder of Stockau Abbey in 1041. A legend of the 18th century connects the name of Stockau to a tree stump (Stock) on which the king supposedly rested during the battle. The altar of the abbey's church was supposed to correspond to the location of this tree stump. The chapel of St. Wenceslas in Br\u016fdek, V\u0161eruby municipality is said to have been built by B\u0159etislav in 1047 to commemorate the battle.Josef Franti\u0161ek, Jaroslav Schaller, Topographie des K\u00f6nigreichs B\u00f6hmen vol. 12 (1789), p. 80.
