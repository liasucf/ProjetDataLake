    "text": "Carolina Durante is a Spanish indie rock band formed in 2017 in Madrid composed of Diego Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, Mart\u00edn Vallhonrat, Juan Pedrayes and Mario del Valle. The group signed a joint record deal with Sonido Muchacho and released their debut extended play Necrom\u00e1ntico in December 2017. Their debut studio album was released in April 2019 and debuted at the second spot of the PROMUSICAE chart. In 2019, Carolina Durante was the Spanish act that more concerts had offered in that year. == Background == The band was formed in 2017 in Madrid. The four members chose to name the band like this due to a romantic summer interest Mario del Valle had as a teenager. Carolina Durante is a real woman who also studied alongside Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez at the religious school Santa Mar\u00eda de Yelmo in Chamber\u00ed and is now a journalist at the Agencia EFE. == Career == Carolina Durante signed a joined contract in 2017 with Sonido Muchacho and released their first EP titled Necrom\u00e1tico on December 23 which was well received by the critics. In March 2018 the band released their first hit single 'Cayetano' which caused major controversy due to its explicitly and naming of the main politic parties in Spain. The song earned the band a Premio MIN for 'Song of the Year' and another one for 'Best New Artist. In November 2018 the band released a more pop track titled 'Perdona (Ahora S\u00ed Que S\u00ed)\" alongside Amaia, who won the ninth edition of the very well-known Spanish musical talent competition Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo. This one is the one who opened them the doors to a major national popularity. However, \"Perdona\" is not an original song but a cover of Marcelo Criminal's. Thus, the band released their debut studio album, which they called Carolina Durante, on April 26, 2019 and premiered with four secret shows in Madrid, Valencia, Barcelona and Seville. The album debuted at the second position of the PROMUSICAE chart, lasted on it for 25 consecutive weeks and was named the best Spanish album of 2019 by specialized portals like El Cultural. In May they started a festival tour that visited many festivals like the Benic\u00e0ssim International Festival, Dcode, Low Festival or Donostia Festibala. In November they started their first solo tour that visited Spain, London and Berlin. They performed at the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Madrid. In March 2020 the tour stopped due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. == Discography == === Studio albums === * Carolina Durante (2019) === EPs === * Necrom\u00e1tico (2017) * Examiga (2018) * Del Horno a la Boca (2020) === Singles === * \"La noche de los muertos vivientes\" (2017) * \"En verano\" (2017) * \"Necrom\u00e1ntico\" (2017) * \"Cayetano\" (2018) * \"Ni\u00f1a de hielo\" (2018) * \"300 golpes\" (2018) * \"El himno titular\" (2018) * \"Perdona (ahora s\u00ed que s\u00ed)\" with Amaia (2018) * \"Joder, no s\u00e9\" (2019) * \"Las canciones de Juanita\" (2019) * \"El a\u00f1o\" (2019) * \"No tan j\u00f3venes\" (2019) * \"La canci\u00f3n que no creo que te mereces\" (2020) == Awards and nominations == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year!!Awards!!Category!!Nominee/work!!Result |- | rowspan=\"3\" |2019 | rowspan=\"2\" |Premios MIN |Best New Artist |Carolina Durante | |- |Song of the Year |Cayetano | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |MTV Europe Music Awards | rowspan=\"2\" |Best Spanish Act | rowspan=\"2\" |Themselfes | |- |2020 | |} == References == Category:Musical groups established in 2017 Category:Spanish indie rock groups ",
