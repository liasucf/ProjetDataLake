He was best known of being instrumental in the Treaty of Singapore with the British East India Company in 1819. ==History== He was born in the Johor Sultanate in 1755 to Tun Abdul Hamid. In 1802, his father was installed as the Temenggong by Sultan Mahmud Ri\u2019ayat Shah after the death of his grandfather Temenggong Abdul Jamal. However only a year later in 1803, his father died and the Sultan installed his uncle Engku Muda Muhammad as the Temenggong. Engku Muda Muhammad himself rejected the position and wanted the position of Yang Dipertuan Muda instead, but the Sultan would not approve. In 1806, Abdul Rahman was installed as Temenggong of Johor after his uncle's death by the Sultan at Lingga. Temenggong Abdul Rahman and his family and followers later moved to Singapura in 1811 to establish a governance there. By the time Sir Stamford Raffles arrived in Singapura on 29 January 1819, there were an estimated 1,000 people there. There Raffles befriended Temenggong Abdul Rahman who lived near the river (present day Singapore River). Due to him being the staunch supporter of Tengku Hussein Shah, the Temenggong helped Raffles to smuggle Hussein from Riau to Singapura. Raffles offered to recognize Hussein Shah as the rightful Sultan of Johor, and provide him with a yearly payment, but in return, Hussein would grant the British East India Company the right to establish the island as a trading post. On 6 February 1819, Temenggong Abdul Rahman, with Hussein Shah signed the Treaty with Raffles and Major William Farquhar, marking Singapore as a British settlement. In the agreement, Sultan Hussein Shah received a yearly sum of 5,000 Spanish dollars, while the Temenggong himself received a yearly sum of 3,000 Spanish dollars and was therefore granted the hereditary style of His Highness by the British on 30 February 1819. In 1823, Temenggong Abdul Rahman, his family and followers moved to the 200 acres of land (part of Teluk Belanga area) as allocated by Raffles. Temenggong Abdul Rahman and Sultan Hussein were called upon to sign the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with the British Government at the Government Hill on 2 August 1824. In the agreement, the Sultan received 33,200 Spanish dollars and a monthly allowance of 1,300 Spanish dollars for life, while the Temenggong received a monthly stipend of 700 Spanish dollars in addition to a lump sum of 26,800 Spanish dollars, and agreed to maintain free trade in their possessions but were forbid to have any correspondence with foreigners without the EIC\u2019s permission. ==Death== Temenggong Abdul Rahman died in his house Istana Lama at Teluk Belanga in 8 December 1825 and was buried at the nearby Makam Diraja Teluk Blangah. He was informally succeed by his son Tun Haji Abdullah. ==References== Category:1755 births Category:1825 deaths Category:People of British Singapore Category:House of Temenggong of Johor ",
