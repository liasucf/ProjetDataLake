The Jamshidi are primarily sedentary people living in Herat, and are believed to be of mixed Arab and Persian descent. Some Jamshidis have settled in Turkmenistan. A 1926 publication notes that the Iranian city of Nishapur (in northeast Iran, near Badghis Province) has a population of \"Jamshidis\", originating from \"north of Herat\" who moved to the area following the Perso-Afghan War. These Jamshidis self-described as Baluch, spoke Persian, and were Ismaili. ==See also== *Aimaq people ==References== Category:Aymaq Category:Ethnic groups in Herat Province Category:Modern nomads ",
