    "text": "We All Want the Same Things is the third studio album by Craig Finn. It was released on Partisan Records on March 24, 2017. The title comes from a line in the song \"God in Chicago\". Craig Finn said, \"It seems like a bit of dark humor in these turbulent political times, but it also rings true: No matter our differences, we all have some very basic wants and needs that line up with each other.\" ==Critical reception== At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73% based on 15 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Sarah Murphy of Exclaim! gave the album a 6 out of 10, saying, \"We All Want the Same Things won't quench the casual fan's thirst for new drunken bar rock anthems, but for those willing to listen a bit more closely (and quietly), Finn's solo work still provides some stories worth hearing. Sam Sodomsky of Pitchfork gave the album a 7.8 out of 10 and called it \"a remarkable record not for sounding like a return-to-form, but for feeling like entirely new territory without sacrificing its thrill or familiarity.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" !scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) !scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"| US Independent Albums (Billboard) | 12 |- !scope=\"row\"| US Tastemaker Albums (Billboard) | 18 |- !scope=\"row\"| US Americana/Folk Albums (Billboard) | 11 |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2017 albums Category:Craig Finn albums Category:Partisan Records albums ",
