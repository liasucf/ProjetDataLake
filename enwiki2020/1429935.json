    "text": "George Speck (also known as George Crum;Hugh Bradley, Such Was Saratoga, New York: 1940 (July 15, 1824 \u2013 July 22, 1914) was an American chef. He worked as a hunter, guide, and cook in the Adirondack mountains, and became noted for his culinary skills after being hired at Moon\u2019s Lake House on Saratoga Lake, near Saratoga Springs, New York. Speck's specialities included wild meat, especially venison and duck, and he often experimented in the kitchen. During the 1850s, while working at Moon's Lake House in the midst of a dinner rush, Speck tried slicing the potatoes extra thin and dropping the slices into the deep hot fat of the frying pan. Although recipes for potato chips were published in several cookbooks decades prior to the 1850s, a local legend associates Speck with the creation of potato chip.Hugh Bradley. Such Was Saratoga 1940:121-122 ==Early life== Speck was born on July 15, 1824 in Saratoga County in upstate New York. Though information about their actual heritage is unclear, and has been assumed to be African-American and mixed- race, Speck and his sister Catherine Wicks \"both identified as members of the St. Regis Mohawk tribe.\" ==Early career== Speck developed his culinary skills at Cary Moon's Lake House on Saratoga Lake, noted as an expensive restaurant at a time when wealthy families from Manhattan and other areas were building summer \"camps\" in the area. Speck and his sister, Wicks, also cooked at the Sans Souci in Ballston Spa, alongside another St. Regis Mohawk Indian known for his skills as a guide and cook, Pete Francis. One of the regular customers at Moon's was Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, who, although he savored the food, could never seem to remember Speck's name. On one occasion, he called a waiter over to ask \"Crum,\" \"How long before we shall eat?\" Rather than take offense, Speck decided to embrace the nickname, figuring that, \"A crumb is bigger than a speck.\"Elizabeth Barrett Britten [Jean McGregor]. Chronicles of Saratoga, Saratoga Springs, NY: Bradshaw 1947:176 By 1860, Speck had opened his own restaurant, called Crum's, on Storey Hill in nearby Malta, New York. His cuisine was in high demand among Saratoga Springs' tourists and elites: \"His prices were\u2026those of the fashionable New York restaurants, but his food and service were worth it\u2026Everything possible was raised on his own small farm, and that, too, got his personal attention whenever he could arrange it.\"Hugh Bradley, Such Was Saratoga, New York: 1940, 121-122. According to popular accounts, he was said to include a basket of chips on every table. One contemporaneous source recalls that in his restaurant, Speck was unquestionably the man in charge: \"His rules of procedure were his own. They were very strict, and being an Indian, he never departed from them. In the slang of the racecourse, he \"played no favorites.\" Guests were obliged to wait their turn, the millionaire as well as the wage-earner. Mr. Vanderbilt once was obliged to wait an hour and a half for a meal...With none but rich pleasure-seekers as his guests, Speck kept his tables laden with the best of everything, and for it all charged Delmonico prices.\"New York Tribune December 27, 1891 ==Potato chip== Recipes for frying potato slices were published in several cookbooks in the 19th century. In 1832, a recipe for fried potato \"shavings\" was included in a United States cookbook derived from an earlier English collection.\"Civil War Recipes and Food History \u2013 The Potato During the Civil War\" , Civil War Interactive website William Kitchener's The Cook's Oracle (1822), also included techniques for such a dish.Kitchener, Dr. William, 1822.

Francis and David Felt. The New York Tribune ran a feature article on \"Crum's: The Famous Eating House on Saratoga Lake\" in December 1891, but mentioned nothing about potato chips. Neither did Crum's commissioned biography, published in 1893, nor did one 1914 obituary in a local paper.\"George Crum Dies at Saratoga Lake\", The (Saratoga Springs) Saratogian, July 27, 1914 Another obituary states \"Crum is said to have been the actual inventor of \"Saratoga chips.\"\" When Wicks died in 1924, however, her obituary authoritatively identified her as follows: \"A sister of George Crum, Mrs. Catherine Wicks, died at the age of 102, and was the cook at Moon\u2019s Lake House. She first invented and fried the famous Saratoga Chips.\"The Saratogian Saratoga Springs, New York, October 8, 1924 Wicks recalled the invention of Saratoga Chips as an accident: she had \"chipped off a piece of the potato which, by the merest accident, fell into the pan of fat. She fished it out with a fork and set it down upon a plate beside her on the table.\" Her brother tasted it, declared it good, and said, \"We\u2019ll have plenty of these.\"Elizabeth Barrett Britten [Jean McGregor]. Chronicles of Saratoga, Saratoga Springs, NY: Bradshaw 1947:44-45 In a 1932 interview with the Saratogian newspaper, her grandson, John Gilbert Freeman, asserted Wicks's role as the true inventor of the potato chip.\"Another Claims Potato Chip Idea\" Glens Falls Post Star August 4, 1932 Hugh Bradley's 1940 history of Saratoga contains some information about Speck, based on local folklore as much as on any specific historical primary sources. In their 1983 article in Western Folklore, Fox and Banner say that Bradley had cited an 1885 article in the Hotel Gazette about Speck and the potato chips. Bradley repeated some material from that article, including that \"Crum was born in 1828, the son of Abe Speck, a mulatto jockey who had come from Kentucky to Saratoga Springs and married a Stockbridge Indian woman,\" and that, \"Crum also claimed to have considerable German and Spanish blood.\" In any event, Speck helped popularize the potato chip, first as a cook at Moon's and then in his own place. Cary Moon, owner of Moon\u2019s Lake House, later rushed to claim credit for the invention, and began mass-producing the chips, first served in paper cones, then packaged in boxes. They became wildly popular: \"It was at Moon\u2019s that Clio first tasted the famous Saratoga chips, said to have originated there, and it was she who first scandalized spa society by strolling along Broadway and about the paddock at the race track crunching the crisp circlets out of a paper sack as though they were candy or peanuts. She made it the fashion, and soon you saw all Saratoga dipping into cornucopias filled with golden-brown paper-thin potatoes; a gathered crowd was likely to create a sound like a scuffling through dried autumn leaves.\" Visitors to Saratoga Springs were advised to take the 10-mile journey around the lake to Moon's if only for the chips: \"the hobby of the Lake House is Fried Potatoes, and these they serve in good style. They are sold in papers like confectionary.\"R.F. Dearborn, Saratoga and How to See It. Albany, NY: Weed, Parsons, and Company 1871:51 A 1973 advertising campaign by the St. Regis Paper Company, which manufactured packaging for chips, featured an ad for Speck and his story, published in the national magazines, Fortune and Time. During the late 1970s, the variant of the story featuring Vanderbilt became popular because of the interest in his wealth and name, and evidence suggests the source was an advertising agency for the Potato Chip/Snack Food Association.Burhans, Dirk (2008). Crunch! A History of the Great American Potato Chip, Madison, WI: Terrace Books (Univ. of Wisconsin Press), pp. 15\u201321. A 1983 article in Western Folklore identifies potato chips as having originated in Saratoga Springs, New York, while critiquing the variants of popular stories. In all versions, the chips became popular and subsequently known as \"Saratoga chips\" or \"potato crunches\".William S. Fox and Mae G. Banner, Topics and Comments: \"Social and Economic Contexts of Folklore Variants: The Case of Potato Chip Legends\", Western Folklore (Western States Folklore Society), Vol. 42, No. 2 (Apr. 1983), pp. 114\u2013126, accessed June 20, 2013 The 21st-century Snopes website writes that Crum's customer, if he existed, was more likely an obscure one. Vanderbilt was indeed a regular customer at both Crum's Malta restaurant and Moon's Lake House, but there is no evidence that he played a role by requesting or promoting potato chips.\"Early Lake Houses Saratoga, New York\", from Reminiscences of Saratoga, compiled by Cornelius E.
