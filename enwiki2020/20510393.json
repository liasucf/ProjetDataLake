    "text": "Raden Dr. Ali Sastroamidjojo, (EYD: Ali Sastroamijoyo; 21 May 1903 \u2013 13 March 1975) was the eighth and tenth Prime Minister of Indonesia and also the Indonesian Permanent Representative to the United Nations (UN) (1957\u20131960) and the first Indonesian Ambassador to the United States, Ambassador to Canada and the Ambassador to Mexico (1950\u20131955). In addition, he was also appointed chairman of the Asian-African Conference in Bandung in 1955 and also was chairman of the Indonesian National Party (PNI) (1960\u20131966). ==Early life== Raden Ali Sastroamidjojo was born in Grabag, Central Java, Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), to an aristocratic family of the Magelang Regency belonging to the Indonesian elite, and died in Jakarta, 13 March 1975. Ali Sastroamidjojo is greeted by Zhou Enlai upon his arrival in Beijing, 26 May 1955. He spent his childhood years in the local town, playing with his friends from peasant families. In hoping to find a proper environment for the development of their children, the Sastroamidjojo family moved to the city where Sastroamidjojo was sent to receive a European education, although he also regularly studied the Javanese language. The Sastroamidjojo family was devoted to advocating the importance of Western education. ==Pre-independence career== Like most other young men of nobility in Indonesia, Sastroamidjojo attended a Dutch school, the Queen Wilhelmina School, and went on to study law at Leiden University in the Netherlands where he received a doctorate in law in 1927. He then went into private practice. He was a member of a number of pre-independence political parties, including the original Indonesian National Party (PNI) and Partindo. During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, he worked for the occupation government. ==Political career in the Sukarno era== Sastroamidjojo, by now a member of the post-independence PNI, served as deputy minister of education in the first Indonesian cabinet, which lasted from September to November 1945. He was minister of education in three successive cabinets between July 1947 and August 1949. From 1950 to 1953, Sastroamidjojo was Indonesian ambassador to the United States. On 1 August 1953 he became Prime Minister of Indonesia, leading the First Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet until it fell in July 1955. He became prime minister for a second time on 26 March 1956, although the cabinet he headed lasted less than a year. He was a key figure in the negotiations of the Sino-Indonesian Dual Nationality Treaty. In July 1960, at the ninth annual congress of the PNI, Sastroamidjojo was elected party chairman. Ali Sastroamidjojo has been called 'the greatest statesman' of Indonesia and it was said of him that 'the current statesmen of Indonesia will never be as great as Sastroamidjojo in his role as prime minister who also had great literary talent'. In 1967, following the fall of Sukarno, Sastroamidjojo was arrested, but later released without having been tried. ==Legacy== The current Embassy of Indonesia in Washington, D.C., was purchased by Ali Sastroamidjojo on 19 December 1951 for $335,000. In addition to being a political figure, he was also a noted author having published several books and publications in the field of international relations and foreign policy, including Introduction to International Law (1971), Indonesian Foreign Policy (1972), an autobiographical book of his journey and milestones (1974), and Four Indonesian students in the Netherlands (1975). ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * * * * ==External links== * Category:1903 births Category:1976 deaths Category:People from Magelang Regency Category:Prime Ministers of Indonesia Category:National Heroes of Indonesia Category:Indonesian National Party politicians Category:Bandung Conference attendees Category:Leiden University alumni Category:Defense ministers of Indonesia Category:Members of the People's Representative Council, 1955 ",
