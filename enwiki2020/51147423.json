    "text": "Chuvash literature () \u2014 consists of literature written in the Chuvash language, regardless of the ethnic origin of the authors or the place of publication. This term applies to fictional works, but does not include folklore. ==History== The Chuvash language is the only surviving member of the Oghur or Bulgar branch of the Turkic group of languages. Therefore, Chuvash literature begins with ancient Turkic literature. The history of Chuvash literature begins when texts in the Chuvash language first appear in historical sources. The oldest known Chuvash texts appear on the gravestones left by the Volga Bulgars in the 13th and 14th centuries in the Middle Volga region, during the reign of the Golden Horde. Most of the epitaphs on the tombstones were written in Oghur languages, of which Chuvash is the only extant member. While these epitaphs cannot be considered full-fledged literary work they do ensure that the Chuvash language of the Golden Horde is forever cemented in time. Even in their plain texts, you can find a certain artistry and in some instances there is even plot development. ===The ancient Turkic literature=== Modern people have learned about ancient Turkic literature mainly by studying the monuments of ancient Turkic runic writing, Manichean writing and ancient Uyghur writing. ===The role of Volga Bulgars culture in the Chuvash literature=== Literature created in the Chuvash language dates back to medieval Oghur language. This is the principal value of the culture of the Chuvash Volga Bulgars in the literature. Aside from the aforementioned epitaphs, there are no surviving texts in the Oghur language. Medieval translations of Oghur literature were completed, however, often based directly on the Oghur sources. Yaqub ibn Numan, who lived in the 11th century, authored the pseudo-historical work \"History of Bulgar\", but this work has not survived. Abu H\u00e1mid al-Garn\u00e1ti met with the ibn Numan and wrote a work based on \"History of Bulgar\". This work alludes to the animosity between the Bulgars and the Khazars, another ethnic group in Central Asia and features a narrative about how the Bulgars converted to Islam. Much of these historical events are presented by al-Garn\u00e1ti in a mythologized form. He includes characters that are similar to characters in modern Chuvash folklore such as Ulyp, a giant and a legendary hero. ===8th century - Early 19th century=== Aside from the epitaphs of gravestones during the Golden Horde period (13th-14th centuries), more artistic texts in the Chuvash languages began to appear in the 18th century, with the emergence of the Chuvash alphabet. For example, one poem by an anonymous writer in 1767 praised Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia: \u041f\u0435\u043b\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0440 \u0430\u0431\u0438\u0440\u044c \u0442\u044f \u043c\u0438\u043d\u044c \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0441 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044f, \u0421\u0430\u043d\u0430, \u0447\u0438\u0431\u0435\u0440\u044c \u043f\u0430\u0442\u0448\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430-\u043c\u044b\u0440\u044b\u043d\u044c \u0410\u043d\u043d\u044f, J\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0448\u0430\u043d \u043f\u0438\u0440\u0435. \u041f\u0435\u043b\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0440 \u0445\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0435\u043d \u0422\u043e\u0440\u0430, \u0445\u0443\u0436\u0443 \u0441\u044e\u043b\u044c\u0434\u0430. \u041f\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0430\u043d \u0438 \u0434\u0430\u0445 \u0447\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c. \u041f\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u044f\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0436\u0435\u043d, \u043d\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0441j\u043e\u043a \u0447\u043e\u043d \u0430\u043d\u0447\u0430\u0445, \u2014 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044f \u0432\u044b\u0440\u043d\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0440 \u0432\u0443\u043b\u0434\u0430 \u0430\u043f\u043f\u0438\u043d\u044c \u0441\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0445!\u041d. \u0418. \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432. \u0427\u0103\u0432\u0430\u0448 \u0441\u0103\u0432\u0432\u0438. \u0428., 1977, 48 \u0441. \u20148 \u0421(\u0427\u0423\u0412) \u0418 20 Translation: We do not know what to give / You, beautiful queen, universal mother, for the love of us.

More than 10 similar Chuvash poems, mostly with unknown authors, have been identified.

During these years, there were works in the Chuvash language using this new alphabet. The highest achievement of the Chuvash literature of this period may be a poem by Mikhail Fedorov \"Arzuri\" (1848-1904). It was written in 1884, spread among the population in the lists. It was published much later, in 1908. During these years, Ignatius Ivanov (1848-1885) also wrote works of literature. He is best known as the author of a cycle of short stories entitled \"How to Live Chuvash\"\u042d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f | \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0418\u0433\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0439 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 Some of his creations have been published in the primer by I.

He became a large figure in the Chuvash culture and, in particular, in the realm of literature. Yurkin's major works of literature include \"Wealth\" and \"The Man is Full, But His Eyes Were Hungry\". He was also known as a journalist and an active defender of the traditional religion of the Chuvash. === Chuvash literature of the 20th century === See also :Category:Chuvash writers == References == == Literature == * \u00ab\u0427\u0103\u0432\u0430\u0448 \u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0438\u043d \u0430\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0439\u0115\u00bb, \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438: \u0414. \u0412. \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0432, \u042e. \u0410. \u0421\u0438\u043b\u044d\u043c. \u0428\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0430\u0440, 2003. . * \u0412\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0439 \u0420\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432, \u00ab\u0427\u0103\u0432\u0430\u0448 \u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0438.
