    "text": "The second season of the Malayalam-language version of Indian reality television series Bigg Boss premiered on 5 January 2020. It was produced by Endemol Shine India and boardcast on Asianet. Mohanlal returned as the host. The show follows a total of 22 contestants, who are isolated from the outside world for 105 days (or 15 weeks) in a custom built house. The housemates are dictated by an omnipresent entity named Bigg Boss. Each week, one or more of the housemates are evicted by a public vote. The house is situated at EVP Film City in Chennai, where 17 contestants entered on Day 1 and six joined later as wildcard entries. All housemates are public figures, such as film, television, music, radio, stage and internet personalities, and models. The winner of the season will receive a flat worth \u20b95 million (\u20b950 lakh) along with a trophy. The show aired daily at 9:00pm IST. The second season introduced an aftershow titled BB Cafe. On 17 March 2020, Endemol Shine India announced that they are voluntarily suspending all their administrative and production departments until further notice due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, for minimizing the spread and to comply with the safety and precautionary measures suggested by the government. It is also in the wake of decision by Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) and Indian Film & Television Directors' Association (IFTDA) to hold shootings of film, TV shows and web series from 19 March to 31 March 2020. As of 2020, this was the fourth season overall in the Big Brother franchise to have a season discontinued without a winner, following Arab world's Big Brother: The Boss, Serbia's second season of Veliki Brat, and Canada's eighth Big Brother; while the latter also ceasing production for the same reason due to the pandemic, the first two were not caused by the pandemic (Arab world was due to a religious controversy, and Serbia was due to the deaths of the HouseGuests). ==Housemates== The following are the list of housemates in the Bigg Boss house.https://www.keralatv.in/bigg-boss-season-2-malayalam-contestants/ {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; line-height:20px; width:auto; margin:auto;\" !scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Housemate !scope=\"col\" | Occupation !scope=\"col\" | Day entered !scope=\"col\" | Day exited !Status |- | style=\"background:#C46210; text-align:center;\" | | Abhirami Suresh | Singer, Composer | Day 49 | Day 75 | |- | style=\"background:#C46210; text- align:center;\" | | Amrutha Suresh | Singer, Composer | Day 49 | Day 75 | |- | rowspan=2 style=\"background:#0048BA; text-align:center;\" | | rowspan=2| Alina Padikkal | rowspan=2| Actress, television presenter | Day 1 | Day 39 | |- | Day 55 | Day 75 | |- | rowspan=2 style=\"background:#0048BA; text- align:center;\" | | rowspan=2| Alasandra Johnson | rowspan=2| Model, Air Hostess | Day 1 | Day 32 | |- | Day 49 | Day 75 | rowspan=\"2\" |- | style=\"background:#0048BA; text-align:center;\" | | Arya | Actress, television presenter | Day 1 | Day 75 |- | rowspan=2 style=\"background:#C46210; text- align:center;\" | | rowspan=2| Daya Ashwathy | rowspan=2| Internet celebrity | Day 21 | Day 39 | |- | Day 55 | Day 75 | rowspan=\"2\" |- | style=\"background:#0048BA; text-align:center;\" | | Fukru (Krishnajeev) | Internet celebrity | Day 1 | Day 75 |- | rowspan=2 style=\"background:#0048BA; text-align:center;\" | | rowspan=2| Raghu Subhash | rowspan=2| Radio Jockey | Day 1 | Day 32 | |- | Day 49 | Day 75 | |- | style=\"background:#0048BA; text- align:center;\" | | Saju Navodaya | Actor, comedian | Day 1 | Day 75 | |- | rowspan=2 style=\"background:#0048BA; text-align:center;\" | | rowspan=2| Sujo Mathew | rowspan=2| Model | Day 1 | Day 32 | |- | Day 49 | Day 75 | |- | rowspan=2 style=\"background:#0048BA; text-align:center;\" | | rowspan=2| Reshma Rajan | rowspan=2| Model | Day 1 | Day 32 | |- | Day 55 | Day 70 | |- | style=\"background:#0048BA; text-align:center;\" | | Rajith Kumar | Public speaker, educator | Day 1 | Day 69 | |- | style=\"background:#0048BA; text- align:center;\" | | Veena Nair | Actress, television presenter | Day 1 | Day 63 | |- | style=\"background:#C46210; text-align:center;\" | | Jazla Madasseri | Activist | Day 21 | Day 56 | |- | style=\"background:#C46210; text- align:center;\" | | Sooraj | Radio Jockey | Day 28 | Day 56 | |- | style=\"background:#0048BA; text-align:center;\" | | Manju Pathrose | Actress;[tv presenter] | Day 1 | Day 48 | |- | style=\"background:#0048BA; text-align:center;\" | | Pradeep Chandran | Actor | Day 1 | Day 42 | |- | rowspan=2 style=\"background:#C46210; text-align:center;\" | | rowspan=2|Pavan Gino Thomas | rowspan=2|Model | Day 28 | Day 32 | |- | Day 37 | Day 40 | |- | style=\"background:#0048BA; text-align:center;\" | | Thesni Khan | Actress, comedian | Day 1 | Day 27 | |- | style=\"background:#0048BA; text- align:center;\" | | Pareekutty Perumbavoor | Actor, singer | Day 1 | Day 21 | |- | style=\"background:#0048BA; text-align:center;\" | | Suresh Krishnan | Film director | Day 1 | Day 21 | |- | style=\"background:#0048BA; text- align:center;\" | | Somadas | Singer | Day 1 | Day 15 | |- | style=\"background:#0048BA; text-align:center;\" | | Rajini Chandy | Actress | Day 1 | Day 14 | |- |} : Original entrant : Re-entrant : Wildcard entrant ==Production== The season two of the Malayalam-language version of Bigg Boss is produced by Endemol Shine India and telecast on Asianet.
