    "text": "The 1971\u201372 Carolina Cougars season was the 3rd season of the Cougars in the ABA. The team was 14\u201328 after one half of the season, with a six-game losing streak (the longest of the season) contributing to the start. They went 21\u201321 (with two instances of three game winning streaks) in the second half, but they lost the final spot in the playoffs by one game to The Floridians. The two teams had met up for their final match-up of the season on March 24 in Greensboro, with the Cougars having two games to play afterwards and the Floridians four, respectively. The Floridians won the game 116\u2013115 in overtime, making their record 35\u201345 and the Cougars record at 33\u201349, which meant that it was all but assured the Cougars were eliminated, due to the Floridians clinching the playoff spot four days later with their 36th win (if they had lost all of their four games, the two teams would have been tied at 35\u201349, which would've necessitated a playoff). The Cougars had missed the playoffs for the 2nd straight year in a row. The team was 5th in points scored at 114.8 per game, but 10th in points allowed at 118.1 per game.https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CAR/1972_games.html ==Roster== * 27 Joe Caldwell \u2013 Small forward * 34 Frank Card \u2013 Forward * -- George Carter \u2013 Small forward * 32 Warren Davis \u2013 Power forward * 54 Randy Denton \u2013 Center * 4 Ron Dorsey \u2013 Forward * 35 Wayne Hightower \u2013 Power forward * 13 Stew Johnson \u2013 Power forward * 33 Wendell Ladner \u2013 Small forward * 21 George Lehmann \u2013 Point guard * 23 Gene Littles \u2013 Point guard * 22 Ed Manning \u2013 Small forward * 24 Ted McClain \u2013 Shooting guard * 1 Jim McDaniels \u2013 Center * 44 Larry Miller \u2013 Shooting guard * 52 Tom Owens \u2013 Center * 33 George Stone \u2013 Small forward * 11 Bob Verga \u2013 Shooting guard * 21 Bob Warren \u2013 Shooting guard ==Final standings== ===Eastern Division=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |+ !
