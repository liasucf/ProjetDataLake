    "text": "Grow Heathrow is a land squat and community garden in Sipson, west London. It was occupied in 2010 by local people concerned about the possibility of the expansion of Heathrow Airport. It is part of the Transition Network. Half of the site was evicted in 2019. ==Community== Around twenty people live at Grow Heathrow. The squat is offgrid and low carbon. Electricity comes from solar panels and wind turbines. There is a meadow with allotments which are used by both residents and local people. There are also three large greenhouses. The project states that it has four main aims: *To further the Heathrow villages as an iconic symbol of community resistance to the economic, ecological and democratic crises. *To develop and promote community and resource autonomy to support long-term community resilience *To establish replicable structures of organisation, which could provide a model for future non-hierarchical, consensus-based communities. *To root the grassroots radical values of the 3rd runway resistance in the Heathrow villages for the long term Alongside four other squats, the project was raided by the Metropolitan Police 24 hours before the 2011 Royal Wedding. There were no arrests. ==Legal struggles== Grow Heathrow has had a long legal battle. In this it is supported by the local MP for Hayes and Harlington and Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer John McDonnell who said in 2017 \u201cWe need lawful spaces of protest with the values of education and community embedded in them; Grow Heathrow would be a great loss for my constituency in this crucial campaign year against Heathrow airport\u2019s expansion.\u201d John McDonnell supporting Grow Heathrow at court Over four years after the occupation the owners, Lewdown Holdings Limited, took legal action on 23 September 2014 at Uxbridge County Court. The owner was granted possession and the project successfully resisted bailiffs in 2015. Grow Heathrow launched an appeal against eviction which lasted into 2016. ==Eviction threat 2019== In February 2019, the project made an urgent callout for support after losing a courtcase. An eviction attempt began on 26 February, which resulted in half the project being evicted and half remaining. == References == ==Further reading== * Eloise Harding (2019) 'Grow Heathrow: a Lockean analysis' Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy, DOI: 10.1080/13698230.2019.1565565 Category:2010 establishments in England Category:DIY culture Category:Squats in the United Kingdom Category:Ecovillages ",
