    "text": "Tom Schwarz (born May 29, 1994) is a German professional boxer. He has held the IBF International heavyweight title since 2019 and previously held the WBO Inter-Continental heavyweight title from 2017 to 2019. ==Professional boxing career== Schwarz first professional fight was on the 29 August 2013 when he won a very fast 20 second KO victory over German 34 year old Mario Schmidt. After getting to a record of 12-0-0 (8 KO's), he accepted the challenge of fellow German contender Konstantin Airich and won via Unanimous Decision over an eight-round fight. In his 15th professional fight on the 15 November 2015, Schwarz was allowed to fight against the powerful 20-year-old German Ilja Mezencev for the vacant WBO Youth World Champion title. Already in the first round, Schwarz went down against Mezencev, who was able to win every one of his ten professional bouts by knockout, and was counted. In the further course of the fight Schwarz could dominate and finally win in the seventh round by knockout to win the WBO World Youth Title. On the 4 June 2016, Schwarz fought against the unbeaten in nine bouts German Dennis Lewandowski for the vacant World Boxing Council (WBC) World Youth Title. This fight also represented the second title defense of the WBO World Youth Title. Schwarz clearly dominated the ten-round fight and won by a Unanimous Decision. On the 22 April 2017, Schwarz won versus the 40-year-old Bosnian Adnan Redzovic (18-1-0) for the vacant WBO Intercontinental Heavyweight Title by knockout victory in the second round. On the 21 April 2018 Schwarz competed against the up to that time also unbeaten German Senad Gashi. In a highly controversial fight, Gashi had several head-butts that resulted in his disqualification in Round 6 of the fight. Until then, the fight was well balanced, with Schwarz being severely beaten several times by the 13-inch smaller Gashi. In the same year two knockout victories followed against the Mexican Julian Fernandez and fellow German Christian Lewandowski from Griefswald. In March 2019, he defended his WBO Intercontinental Heavyweight Title against Kristijan Krstacic of Croatia to record his 24th professional victory. It was announced on March 2019 that Schwarz would take on former World Heavyweight Lineal Ring Magazine Champion Tyson Fury in a 12-round bout on the June 15, 2019 in Las Vegas United States. He lost the fight in round two. ==Professional boxing record== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\" |- ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes |- |27 |Win |26\u20131 |align=left| Ilja Mezencev |RTD |6 (12), |28 Sep 2019 |align=left| |align=left| |- |26 |Win |25\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Radek Varak |TKO |1 (6), |17 Aug 2019 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |25 |Loss |24\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Tyson Fury |TKO |2 (12), |15 Jun 2019 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |24 |Win |24\u20130 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Kristijan Krstacic |KO |2 (10), |2 Mar 2019 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |23 |Win |23\u20130 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Christian Lewandowski |TKO |6 (10), |17 Nov 2018 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |- |22 |Win |22\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Julian Fernandez |KO |2 (12), |15 Sep 2018 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |- |21 |Win |21\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Senad Gashi |DQ |6 (12), |21 Apr 2018 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |20 |Win |20\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Samir Nibo |TKO |4 (12) |3 Feb 2018 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |19 |Win |19\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Adnan Redzovic |KO |2 (10) |22 Apr 2017 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |18 |Win |18\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ivica Bacurin |UD |8 |11 Mar 2017 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |- |17 |Win |17\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Dennis Lewandowski |UD |10 |4 Jun 2016 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |- |16 |Win |16\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Gogita Gorgiladze |TKO |1 (10), |5 Mar 2016 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |- |15 |Win |15\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ilja Mezencev |KO |7 (10), |14 Nov 2015 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |14 |Win |14\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Gezim Tahiri |RTD |3 (6), |19 Sep 2015 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |13 |Win |13\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Konstantin Airich |UD |8 |11 Jul 2015 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |- |12 |Win |12\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Vaclav Pejsar |UD |6 |2 May 2015 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |11 |Win |11\u20130 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Jakov Gospic |TKO |3 (6), |7 Mar 2015 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |10 |Win |10\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Adnan Buharalija |KO |1 (6), |20 Dec 2014 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |9 |Win |9\u20130 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Tomas Mrazek |PTS |6 |2 Oct 2014 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |8 |Win |8\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Olegs Lopajevs |TKO |1 (6), |26 Jul 2014 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |7 |Win |7\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ante Verunica |TKO |1 (3), |30 May 2014 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |6 |Win |6\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Lukas Filka |TKO |1 (3), |30 May 2014 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |5 |Win |5\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Frantisek Kynkal |KO |1 (4), |28 Mar 2014 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |4 |Win |4\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Janis Ginters |UD |4 |1 Mar 2014 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |3 |Win |3\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Edgars Kalnars |UD |4 |6 Dec 2013 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |2 |Win |2\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Pavlo Nechyporenko |TKO |1 (4), |19 Oct 2013 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |1 |Win |1\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Mario Schmidt |KO |1 (4), |28 Jun 2013 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |} == References == == External links == * Category:German male boxers Category:World heavyweight boxing champions Category:World Boxing Organization champions Category:Heavyweight boxers Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Halle (Saale) ",
