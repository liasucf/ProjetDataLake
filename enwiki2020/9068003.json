    "text": "Ondal (\uc628\ub2ec, \u6eab\u9054, ?-590), commonly referred to by Koreans as \"On Dal the Fool\" (babo ondal), was a general of Goguryeo, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. A legend tells that his waist was bent and his face was ugly, but he had a good heart. His family was very poor, so he always begged for his mother. Though simple-minded, he rose from common origins to become a remarkable and brave general. He later married to Princess Pyeonggang, daughter of King Pyeongwon of Goguryeo, which was considered a phenomenal tale for a low-class man to marry a royal woman. Afterwards, he went on becoming a general, serving his country. He died in 590 at Achasanseong Fortress during a battle against the Silla army. ==Popular culture== * Portrayed by Lee Jong-hyun in the 2017 Netflix TV series My Only Love Song. ==See also== *Pyeongwon of Goguryeo ==References== Category:590 deaths Category:Goguryeo people Category:Year of birth unknown ",
