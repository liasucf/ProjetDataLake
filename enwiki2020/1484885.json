    "text": "canted bay window in Lengerich, Germany A bay window is a window space projecting outward from the main walls of a building and forming a bay in a room. ==Types== Bay window is a generic term for all protruding window constructions, regardless of whether they run over one or multiple storeys. In plan, the most frequently used shapes are isosceles trapezoid (which may be referred to as a canted bay windowGlossary of Architectural Terms s.v. Bay Window.) and rectangle. But other polygonal shapes with more than two corners are also common as are curved shapes. If a bay window is curved it may alternatively be called bow window.John Fleming, Hugh Honour, Nikolaus Pevsner, The Penguin Dictionary of Architecture, Fourth edition, Harmondsworth 1991, p. 36. Bay windows in a triangular shape with just one corner exist but are relatively rare. A bay window supported by a corbel, bracket or similar is called an oriel window. ==Uses== Most medieval bay windows and up to the Baroque era are oriel windows. They frequently appear as a highly ornamented addition to the building rather than an organic part of it. Particularly during the Gothic period they often serve as small house chapels, with the oriel window containing an altar and resembling an apse of a church. Especially in Nuremberg these are even called (), with the most famous example being the one from the parsonage of St. Sebaldus Church. In Islamic architecture, oriel windows such as the Arabic mashrabiya are frequently made of wood and allow viewing out while restricting visibility from the outside. Especially in warmer climates, a bay window may be identical to a balcony, with a privacy shield or screen. Bay windows can make a room appear larger, and provide views of the outside which would be unavailable with an ordinary flat window. They are found in terraced houses, semis and detached houses as well as in blocks of flats. Based on British models, their use spread to other English-speaking countries like Ireland, the US, Canada and Australia. Following the pioneering model of pre-modern commercial architecture at the Oriel Chambers in Liverpool, they feature on early Chicago School skyscrapers, where they often run the whole height of the building's upper storeys. Bay windows were identified as a defining characteristic of San Francisco architecture in a 2012 study that had a machine learning algorithm examine a random sample of 25,000 photos of cities from Google Street View. == Gallery == File:Bay Window (PSF).jpg|Typical residential canted bay window, rising from the ground File:Bay window (PSF).png|Typical interior of a residential bay window File:MultiStoryBayWindow.jpg|Interior of a multi-story bay window in Chicago, Illinois File:N\u00fcrnberg Sebalder Pfarrhof Sebalder Ch\u00f6rlein.jpg| at the parsonage of St. Sebaldus Church, Nuremberg, before 1361Inventary of Germanisches Nationalmuseum where the original is kept while the image shows a 1902 replica File:FR Colmar 20080828 026.jpg|Two superposed Renaissance oriel windows in Colmar, France File:Exeter College Bay Window in Turl Street.jpg|An oriel window in Turl Street belonging to Exeter College, Oxford File:Back is best - geograph.org.uk - 1225942.jpg|Rear of the grade II* listedBritish Listed Buildings luxurious 19th-century Regency apartment block Clarence Mansions in Leamington Spa File:585 and 587 Broadway, Chadderton - geograph.org.uk - 1083455.jpg|Typical 1930s bay-fronted semis in Chadderton, Greater Manchester File:Dudley Drive - geograph.org.uk - 580164.jpg|Flats in Hyndland, Glasgow, late 19th or early 20th century File:Oriel chambers.jpg|Oriel Chambers, Liverpool, by Peter Ellis, 1864 File:20110805Hellwigstr7-13 Saarbruecken5.jpg|Triangular oriel windows in Hellwigstrasse, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany, 1927 File:Carved balcony, Mehrangarh Fort.jpg|Mehrangarh Fort, India File:GD-EG-Caire-Suhaymi044.JPG|Mashrabiya, Bayt Al-Suhaymi, Cairo File:Kairo Gayer Anderson Museum BW 9.jpg|Gayer- Anderson Museum, Cairo File:2014 K\u0142odzko, pl.
