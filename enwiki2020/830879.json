The album stands as Queensr\u00ffche's most commercially successful release, reaching triple-platinum status. The primary single, the power ballad \"Silent Lucidity\", reached number 1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks and number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Silent Lucidity\" was also nominated for the Grammy Awards of 1992 in the categories Best Rock Song and Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group. The album won a 1991 Northwest Area Music Award for Best Metal Recording.https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19910304&slug;=1269658 In a June 2019 interview, former vocalist Geoff Tate announced his intentions to perform the entire album live in 2020 to celebrate the 30th anniversary. He also said that there will be a new 30th anniversary edition box set. ==Reception== Empire has received generally positive reviews from critics since its release. AllMusic praised the album, selecting the songs \"Jet City Woman\", \"Empire\", and \"Silent Lucidity\" as the album's best tracks. The review stated that the band went for \"a song-oriented approach that is more art rock and less metal\" with lyrics that talk about social and physical handicaps in \"Best I Can\" and issues such as poverty and regret in \"Della Brown\" and romance with \"Another Rainy Night (Without You)\" and \"Hand On Heart\". The reviewer concluded by praising the band's mature sound and the production done by Peter Collins. Record Collector gave the 20th anniversary edition of the album a generally positive review. The reviewer called the album a \"very pleasant, but only intermittently gripping\" listen, calling the songs \"Best I Can\", \"Silent Lucidity\", and \"Jet City Woman\" as being some of the band's best material. Comparing Empire to the band's earlier albums, The Warning and Rage for Order, the reviewer wrote that it is \"a little boring\". The reviewer concluded by calling the live CD accompanying the re-issue \"flawless\", making it a \"worthwhile reissue\". PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand also reviewed the album's 20th anniversary release. Begrand called the album an \"enigma\" that's \"beautifully produced and features some of the band's quintessential songs, but at the same time it's a rather bloated, conceptually scattershot piece of work containing filler that honestly has not aged very well\". Begrand praised the songs \"Empire\", \"Another Rainy Night\", and \"Silent Lucidity\", calling them the album's best tracks, favorably comparing \"Silent Lucidity\" to Pink Floyd's \"Comfortably Numb\". Begrand had a mixed reaction to the live CD and referred to the cover of \"Scarborough Fair\" as being \"abysmal\". Jim Farber of Entertainment Weekly was highly critical of the album. Farber criticized the album's progressive metal riffs, calling them \"tuneless bombast\" as well as the dire nature of the lyrics. Farber concluded his review by calling the band members \"relentless killjoys\". ==Track listing== == Personnel == ;Queensr\u00ffche * Geoff Tate \u2013 vocals, keyboards * Chris DeGarmo \u2013 6 and 12 strings electric and acoustic guitars, keyboards on \"Best I Can\" and backing vocals, lead guitar on \"Best I Can\", \"Jet City Woman\", \"Silent Lucidity\", and \"Anybody Listening\" * Michael Wilton \u2013 6 and 12 strings electric and acoustic guitars, lead guitar on \"Empire\", \"Resistance\", and \"Another Rainy Night\" * Eddie Jackson \u2013 bass guitars, backing vocals * Scott Rockenfield \u2013 drums, percussion ;Additional musicians * Michael Kamen \u2013 orchestral arrangements on \"Silent Lucidity\", conductor * Randy Gane \u2013 message left on answering machine on \"Empire\" * Robert Bailey \u2013 keyboards, programming ;Production * Peter Collins \u2013 producer * James Barton \u2014 engineer, mixing at Royal Recorders Studios, Lake Geneva, Wisconsin * Marcus Ramaer \u2013 assistant engineer * Dan Harjung \u2013 mixing assistant * Paul Northfield \u2014 engineer on tracks 6, 12, 14 * Neil Kernon \u2014 producer and engineer on track 13 * Tom Hall \u2014 engineer on track 13, assistant engineer on tracks 6, 12, 14 * Bob Ludwig \u2013 mastering at Masterdisk, New York == Charts == ;Album {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Chart !Position |- |rowspan=\"8\"|1990 |align=\"center\"|Billboard 200 (USA) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|7 |- |align=\"center\"|UK Albums Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|13 |- |align=\"center\"|Norwegian Albums Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|14 |- |align=\"center\"|Oricon Japanese Albums Charts |align=\"center\"|18 |- |align=\"center\"|German Albums Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|22 |- |align=\"center\"|Swiss Albums Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|22 |- |align=\"center\"|Swedish Albums Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|26 |- |align=\"center\"|Dutch Albums Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|56 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|1991 |align=\"center\"|RPM100 Albums (Canada) |align=\"center\"|18 |- |align=\"center\"|New Zealand Albums Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|50 |} ;Singles {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Single !Chart !Position |- |rowspan=\"3\"|1990 |align=\"center\"|\"Best I Can\" |align=\"center\"|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks (USA) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|28 |- |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"|\"Empire\" |align=\"center\"|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks | style=\"text-align:center;\"|22 |- |align=\"center\"|UK Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|61 |- |rowspan=\"14\"|1991 |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"8\"|\"Silent Lucidity\" |align=\"center\"|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |align=\"center\"|Billboard Hot 100 (USA) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|9 |- |align=\"center\"|RPM100 Hit Tracks (Canada) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|7 |- |align=\"center\"|UK Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|18 |- |align=\"center\"|German Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|46 |- |align=\"center\"|Swiss Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|24 |- |align=\"center\"|GfK Dutch Charts | style=\"text-align:center;\"|21 |- |align=\"center\"|New Zealand Singles Charts | style=\"text-align:center;\"|11 |- |align=\"center\"|\"Best I Can\" |align=\"center\"|UK Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|36 |- |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\"|\"Jet City Woman\" |align=\"center\"|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks | style=\"text-align:center;\"|6 |- |align=\"center\"|RPM100 Hit Tracks (Canada) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|92 |- |align=\"center\"|UK Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|39 |- |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"|\"Another Rainy Night (Without You)\" |align=\"center\"|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks | style=\"text-align:center;\"|7 |- |align=\"center\"|RPM 100 Hit Tracks (Canada) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|76 |- |1992 |align=\"center\"|\"Anybody Listening?\" |align=\"center\"|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks | style=\"text-align:center;\"|16 |} ==Certifications== {| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" |- |Country |Organization |Year |Sales |- |USA |RIAA |1994 |3\u00d7 Platinum (+ 3,000,000) |- |Canada |CRIA |1991 |Platinum (+ 100,000) |- |UK |BPI |1993 |Silver (+ 60,000) |- |} ==References== Category:1990 albums Category:Queensr\u00ffche albums Category:EMI Records albums Category:Albums produced by Peter Collins (record producer) Category:Albums recorded at Greenhouse Studios ",
