    "text": "Redbridge Football Club is an English association football club based in Barkingside in the London Borough of Redbridge. Prior to July 2004 the club was known as Ford United F.C. The change of name was chosen to help associate the club within the local area and attract a larger support. They should not be confused with the former Redbridge Forest, a predecessor of the current Dagenham & Redbridge, though both come from the borough of Redbridge in Greater London. ==History== The club's roots lie in the car industry, which has long been a staple of the local economy in the surrounding part of East London and Essex.BBC London: Your Team A-Z: Redbridge F.C. The club was previously known as Ford United, which dated from a 1959 merger between two older clubs, Ford Sports (Dagenham) , the football team of the workers at the huge local Ford Motors factory at Dagenham, and Briggs Sports, both of which were founded in 1934. Up until World War II, the latter actually began life as Briggs Motor Bodies and entered a team in the London League under that name between 1935 and 1951. As Ford United, they performed well in the Aetolian League winning the title twice,Sheppey United: Aetolian League \u2013 1959/60 1950\u20131980 League Table Archive Search: Aetolian League \u2013 Division 1 \u2013 1961\u20131962 and finishing runners up once.1950\u20131980 League Table Archive Search: Aetolian League \u2013 Division 1 \u2013 1960\u20131961 The club found itself in serious trouble at the start of 1995\u201396 season, however, as sponsorship from the Ford Motor Company was ended and the disbanding of the club seemed highly likely, until club Vice-Chairman, George Adams enlisted Sky Sports as sponsors, rescuing the club financially. During the 2001\u201302 season Barkingside's lease at their Oakside ground was sold on to Ford United who needed to find a permanent home to allow their progression up the football pyramid. Considerable investment by Jimmy Chapman, the then Chairman saw Oakside developed to a grade 1 ground. From the start of the 2004\u201305 season, Ford United were renamed Redbridge F.C., as the club sought to establish a local identity and improve its support base. Redbridge F.C. played the 2005\u201306 season in the Isthmian League Premier Division, as they were relegated after finishing bottom of Conference South,Football Club History Database: Football Conference National, North and South 2004\u201305 and played in the Isthmian League Division One North in the 2006\u201307 season after being relegated once again.Tony's English Football Site: 2005/06 Fixtures, Results, Tables, Attendances, Maps & Mileages: Isthmian Premier New manager, ex-Wimbledon and Bolton Wanderers striker Dean Holdsworth was appointed on 30 June 2007. In the 2007\u201308 season, they missed the opportunity to be promoted back to the Isthmian League Premier Division, losing 5\u20134 on penalties to Canvey Island in the playoff final,Penalty Shoot Out Heartache for Motormen after finishing third in the Isthmian League Division One North.Tony's English Football Site: 2007/08: Isthmian Division One North On 18 May 2008, Holdsworth left his post as manager of Redbridge to take up the manager's position at Newport County. At the start of June 2008, former Dagenham & Redbridge reserve team coach, Jay Devereux was appointed the club's new manager. Devereux's first season was blighted by floodlight problems at Oakside, but the team still finished a respectable eighth in the division. The side had a disappointing start to the 2009\u201310 season and towards the end of September, it was announced that Devereux and his coaching staff had resigned from their jobs. First team coach Dave Ross took charge for Redbridge's game at Harlow Town, where they drew 3\u20133 after being 2\u20130 down and stayed as manager for the remainder of the season. Poor winter weather affected the side at the start of 2010, the team initially struggled with a fixture pile up but Ross managed to keep the side in the league avoiding relegation. The 2010\u201311 season proved to be one of the most turbulent in the club's history. Manager Dave Ross brought in Kris Taylor to form a management team. After a bad start to the season, which saw the club sitting bottom of the league and Ross was eventually asked to step down. Kris Taylor was confirmed as first team manager on 1 October 2010,Redbridge FC Official Website after talks broke down with Kevin Durrant who looked all set to join the club. Taylor's tenure ended in December 2010 when his work commitments affected the amount of time demanded to run a club of this stature meant he was unable to give 100% to the management of the team. First team coach Jody Brown was appointed manager on a short-term basis just before Christmas 2010 and he was able to bring some stability and stave of relegation with three games of the season still remaining.Redbridge FC Official Website Chairman Dan Holloway moved quickly at the end of the season to make the changes that will bring the structure and stability needed at a football club at this level. Terry Spillane was appointed first team manager after a highly successful spell with Stansted with Jody Brown reverting to a coaching role. On 29 October 2011, Redbridge reached the First Round Proper of the FA Cup for the first time since 2003 after beating Conference National side Ebbsfleet United 2\u20130. In the First Round they drew 0\u20130 with Oxford City and won the replay 2\u20131 after extra time, thanks to goals by Nathan Gordon and Ben Bradbury. They played League Two leaders Crawley Town in the Second Round, where they were beaten 5\u20130, against a side four divisions and 106 places above Redbridge in the league pyramid. The team ended the season well finishing 6th place just 4 points off the play off positions. However, soon after the season finished, Chairman Dan Holloway resigned from the club due to personal reasons and, with the playing budget due to be cut, manager Terry Spillane felt it was not possible to move the team any further and he and his footballing staff left to join fellow Division One North side Maldon & Tiptree. A new joint management team made up of Del Robinson and ex Gravesend and Northfleet legend Steve Portway took charge for the 2012\u201313 season. After a poor start to the season, the team improved in the second half of the season and fought off survival on the last-day to finish 20th and secure another season in the Isthmian League. Former London Bari Chairman Imran Merchant took control of the club ahead of the 2013\u201314 season appointing Ricky Eaton alongside ex- Redbridge manager Dave Ross as joint managers of the club. After a steady season, Merchant stepped down with former Chairman Jimmy Chapman taking over again and although finished within the relegation positions were given a reprieve when Southern League side Clevedon Town lost a ground grading appeal. The following season saw no improvement on the pitch and although they performed well in the local cup competitions they finished bottom of Division One North resulting in relegation back to the Essex Senior League for the first time in 19 years. Ricky Eaton took over from Jim Chapman in the boardroom combining the role of 1st team manager and chairman and an inconsistent debut season back in the Essex Senior League saw a 14th place finish. The following season Dave Ross left the club to be replaced by ex Hornchurch and Canvey Island player Joey May and as a joint management team along with Ricky they assembled a strong side looking for promotion into the Isthmian League and although were in the top two promotion places for most of the season they eventually fell short finishing in 4th place. As of Jan 2019 Ricky Eaton stepped down as manager to solely concentrate on his role as club chairman bringing in May & Baker manager Micky Wetherall who led the team to a 12th placed finish. The side were sitting in 8th position when the 2019/20 season was declared null and void due to the COVID-19 pandemic before Micky decided to step down from his position in Sep 2020 due to personal reasons. Chairman Ricky Eaton acted quickly in bringing former Aveley Reserves manager George Christou to the club. ==Ground== Redbridge play their home games at the Oakside Stadium, Barkingside, Ilford, Essex, IG6 1NB. ==Current squad== As of Sep 20201st Team \u00bb The Team Redbridge FC ==Honours== *Aetolian Division One ** winners (2): 1959\u201360, 1961\u201362 *Essex Elizabethan League ** winners (2): 1959\u201360, 1960\u201361 *Essex Senior League ** winners (2): 1991\u201392, 1996\u201397 *Greater London League ** winners (1): 1970\u201371 *Isthmian League **Division One Champions 2001\u201302 **Division Three Champions 1998\u201399 **Division Two North Champions 1988\u201389 ===Cups=== *Essex Elizabethan Cup ** winners (1): 1970\u201371 *Essex Senior League Cup ** winners (1) 1985\u201386 *Essex Thameside Trophy Winners ** winners (2): 1998\u201399, 2003\u201304 *Essex Senior Trophy ** winners (2): 1990\u201391, 1991\u201392 *London Senior Cup ** winners (2): 1993\u201394, 1997\u201398, 2000\u201301 *Essex Saturday Junior Trophy ** winners (1): 1978\u201379 ==Club records== *Record Home Attendance: 1374 v Port Vale, FA Cup 1st Round Replay 19.11.03 *Record Victory: 10\u20130 v St Margaretsbury(a), Essex Senior League 27.04.19 *Record Defeat: 0\u201311 v Heybridge Swifts(a), Isthmian League Division One North 29.12.12 *Best league performance: 22nd in Conference South, 2004\u201305Redbridge F.C. at the Football Club History Database *Best FA Cup performance: 2nd Round Proper, 2011\u201312 *Best FA Trophy performance: 3rd Round, 2003\u201304Ford United at the Football Club History Database and 2004\u201305 *Best FA Vase performance: 5th Round, 1998\u201399 ==League history== As Redbridge F.C. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !Season !Division !Position !Top League Goalscorer !Manager(s) !Extra Information |- style=\"background: #ffcccc;\" |2004\u201305 |Conference South |22nd |Julian Edwards 9 |Craig Edwards, |Jim Stannard |Relegated |- |2005\u201306 |Isthmian League Premier |22nd |Ian Luck 9 |Jim Stannard, Alan Fenn |Relegated |- |2006\u201307 |Isthmian Division One North |16th |Mitch Hahn 10 |Alan Fenn | |- |2007\u201308 |Isthmian Division One North |3rd |Stephen Butterworth & Jeff Hammond 10 |Dean Holdsworth |Lost in Playoff Final |- |2008\u201309 |Isthmian Division One North |8th |Hakeem Araba 17 |Jay Devereux | |- |2009\u201310 |Isthmian Division One North |18th |Leon Diaczuk 13 |Jay Devereux, Dave Ross | |- |- |2010\u201311 |Isthmian Division One North |16th |Kevin McLeod 12 |Dave Ross, Kris Taylor, Jody Brown | |- |2011\u201312 |Isthmian Division One North |6th |Joe Gardner 13 |Terry Spillane | |- |2012\u201313 |Isthmian Division One North |20th | Jacob Cleaver 16 |Del Robinson & Steve Portway | |- |2013\u201314 |Isthmian Division One North |14th |Daniel Charge 20 |Dave Ross & Ricky Eaton | |- |2014\u201315 |Isthmian Division One North |23rd |Chinedu McKenzie 13 |Dave Ross & Ricky Eaton |Reprieved |- |2015\u201316 |Isthmian Division One North |24th |Jay Knight 11 |Dave Ross & Ricky Eaton |Relegated |- |2016\u201317 |Essex Senior Football League |14th |Jacob Dingli 30 |Dave Ross & Ricky Eaton |- |2017\u201318 |Essex Senior Football League |4th |Brian Moses 33 |Joey May & Ricky Eaton |- |2018\u201319 |Essex Senior Football League |12th |Daniel Gilchrist 18 |Joey May & Ricky Eaton/Micky Wetherall |- |2019\u201320 |Essex Senior Football League |season expunged due to Covid-18 | |Micky Wetherall |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:Football clubs in England Category:Isthmian League Category:Sport in the London Borough of Redbridge Category:Association football clubs established in 2005 Category:Essex Senior Football League Category:Metropolitan\u2013London League Category:Greater London League Category:Aetolian League (football) Category:2005 establishments in England Category:Football clubs in London Category:Works association football teams in England ",
