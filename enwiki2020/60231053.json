    "text": "Adri\u00e1n Emmanuel Mart\u00ednez (born 2 July 1992) is an Argentine footballer who plays as a forward for Paraguayan club Libertad. ==Club career== Born in Campana, Buenos Aires Province, Mart\u00ednez never represented any clubs during his youth setup (except from a year at Villa D\u00e1lmine at the age of 17). He played for hometown amateurs Club Las Acacias (which was presided by his mother) while working as a waste collector and bricklayer; at the former job, he was dismissed from his company after suffering a motorcycle accident. In 2014, after his brother was shot, Mart\u00ednez was arrested after being accused of burning and robbing the aggressor's home. He spent six months in jail until he could prove his innocence. After leaving prison, he returned to his first club Las Acacias before trialling at Primera C Metropolitana side Defensores Unidos in January 2015, subsequently joining the club but initially playing without receiving wages. In 2017, after scoring 21 goals for Defensores, Mart\u00ednez joined Primera B Metropolitana side Atlanta. He scored 15 goals during his only season at the club, netting against Primera Divisi\u00f3n side Belgrano and River Plate in the Copa Argentina. On 18 June 2018, Mart\u00ednez moved abroad and joined Paraguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n club Sol de Am\u00e9rica. He was the club's top goalscorer with 12 goals, notably scoring braces against Olimpia (twice) and 3 de Febrero. On 18 December 2018, Mart\u00ednez signed for Libertad. The following 13 February, he scored a hat-trick in a 5\u20131 Copa Libertadores home rout of The Strongest. ==References== == External links == * * Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:People from Campana, Buenos Aires Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Defensores Unidos footballers Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Atlanta footballers Category:Paraguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Sol de Am\u00e9rica footballers Category:Club Libertad footballers Category:Argentine expatriate footballers Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Paraguay Category:Expatriate footballers in Paraguay ",
