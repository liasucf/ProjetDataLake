Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability. ==Athletics== ;Men's Field {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\" |-align=center !Athlete !Events !Result !Rank |-align=center |align=left rowspan=2|Mohammed Al Mashaykhi |align=left|Shot Put F32 |colspan=2|No Mark |-align=center |align=left|Club Throw F32 |colspan=2|Did not start |} ;Women's Field {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\" |-align=center !Athlete !Events !Result !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Raya Al\u2019Abri |align=left|Javelin F53-54 |9.57 |7 |} == See also == *Oman at the 2016 Summer Olympics == References == Category:Nations at the 2016 Summer Paralympics 2016 Category:2016 in Oman ",
