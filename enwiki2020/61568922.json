    "text": "The Real Bros of Simi Valley is an American scripted television series based in Simi Valley, California. The satirical comedy both pays homage to and lampoons several stereotypes and tropes of unscripted reality shows, with hyperbolic emphasis on exaggerated dramatic elements, and canned infighting among the show's cast. Jimmy Tatro and Christian A. Pierce co-created and executive produce the series and have written every episode. After directing season one with Michael J. Gallagher, Tatro directed every episode of seasons two and three. Tatro also stars alongside Nick Colletti, Tanner Petulla, and Cody Ko as the titular \"Bros\", with supporting cast members including Colleen Donovan, Peter Gilroy, Monette Moio, Monica Joy Shere, and Maddy Whitby. The series follows the lives of four friends ten years after their high school graduation. The first season was released on YouTube and included four episodes. The second season was released November 30, 2018 on Facebook Watch. The third season was released on February 14, 2020. Other executive producers include Mike Rosenstein and Studio 71\u2019s Dan Weinstein, Michael Schreiber, Adam Boorstin and Anjuli Hinds. The show is a parody of Jersey Shore and The Real Housewives. The series received a nomination at the 10th Shorty Awards for best web series. ==Episodes== ===Series overview=== ===Season 1 (2017)=== ===Season 2 (2018\u201319)=== ===Season 3 (2020)=== ==Cast and characters== ===Main=== * Jimmy Tatro as Xander Sanders * Nick Colletti as Duncan Surf * Cody Ko as Wade Sanders * Tanner Petulla as Bryce Meyer * Colleen Donovan as Molly McShay * Peter Gilroy as Johnny Mendez * Monette Moio as Tessa * Monica Joy Sherer as Lexy * Maddy Whitby as Dani (season 2\u2013present) ===Recurring=== * Paul Thomas Arnold as Jeff Sanders * Eric Walbridge as Brayson (seasons 1\u20132) * Tennile Marie Goosic as Sam (season 1) * Cara Santana as Andrea (season 2) * Christine Cattell as Sandy Sanders (season 2\u2013present) * Christian A.
