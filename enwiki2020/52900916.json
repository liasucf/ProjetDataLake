The church hall is also used to celebrate events in the calendar of saints and the liturgical year such as Easter, Christmas and other traditions of the Eastern Orthodox Church. ==Architecture, building and artworks== The church building is located on the Bury New Road (A56) in Broughton, Salford, and was designed by the architects Clegg & Knowles who also designed many of the commercial warehouses in Manchester. The foundation stone for the Church of the Annunciation was laid in 1860 and the building was finally completed a year later in with a classical basilica. The icons on the iconostasis were painted by Theodoros Vryzakis, a key figure in Greek academic art of the 19th century whose work is also exhibited in the National Art Gallery \u2013 Alexandros Soutzos Museum in Athens, Greece. The Pevsner Architectural Guide for Lancashire describes the carving in the church as \u201cuncommonly well done\u201d and the main building as: The church was initially built with a domed ceiling and a mural depicting Christ Pantocrator painted by C. D. Duval in but this was replaced by a pitched roof in after dry rot destroyed the original. The front of the church is made of channelled ashlar with a three bay Corinthian order portico with a modillion cornice. The sides of the church have Corinthian pilasters, windows with pediments and the original polygonal apse can be found at the back of the building. Renovations to the stainless steel roof, slating, lintels, leadwork and masonry were funded by English Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund with work undertaken from 2009 onwards.

Many of the first immigrants were traders of mastic who fled Turkish oppression during the Greek War of Independence. In April the community passed a vote for the creation of a Greek centre of worship in Manchester. From 1843 to 1860 improvised churches were used for worship, including sites on Waterloo Road in the Strangeways area, a venue on Cheetham Hill Road and a chapel on Wellington Street. The growing Greek and Cypriot community in Manchester meant that a more permanent residence was required and a site in Broughton was acquired where building work started in 1860. From the 1950s to 1970s the community grew further as more Greek-Cypriots emigrated to Manchester from Cyprus, some in response to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus and ongoing Cyprus dispute. there were an estimated 2,500 Greeks in Manchester, part of a total of 340,000 Greek nationals and people of Greek ancestry living in the UK recorded by the United Kingdom Census 2011 and the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Around 150 to 200 people attend Sunday services at the church in Broughton. The church celebrated its 150th anniversary on Sunday Archdiocese, Thyateira (2010) with a sermon by the Archbishop of Thyateira Gregorios (Theocharous). ==References== Category:Greek Orthodox churches in the United Kingdom Category:Grade II listed churches in the City of Salford Category:Churches completed in 1861 Category:19th-century churches in the United Kingdom Category:19th-century Eastern Orthodox church buildings Category:Religion in Greater Manchester ",
