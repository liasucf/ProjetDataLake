He was a son of Miko\u0142aj from B\u0119dlewo, nephew of the bishop of Pozna\u0144, Jan of the \u0141odzia coat of arms. He studied law in Italy, finishing his doctorate with decrees, which he obtained before 1365. After returning to Poland (between July 9, 1365, and January 27, 1368) he became a cantor in Pozna\u0144. He also related to the court of Bodzanta, Bodzanty, who appointed him the court judge, in 1359 a canon of Cracow, and in 1364 as the vicar of Bishop. In 1366, the Pope appointed him a canon of Gniezno, and in 1368 he received the provost of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Krak\u00f3w. He was also a papal sub-collector, and from 1365 or 1366 to 1372 he was the office of the Chancellor of Greater Poland. Thanks to this last office, he established close relations with the court of King Ludwik W\u0119gierski, which allowed him to remove political opponents, the most powerful of which was the Crown Deputy Chancellor Jan of Czarnk\u00f3w. Probably Nicholas contributed to accusing him of profaning the tomb of Casimir the Great and stealing the coronation insignia, which meant that Jan was deprived of office. After the death of Jan of Lutogniew, the Pozna\u0144 bishop's office slowed down. On May 7, 1375, he received the sacrament and sat on the throne of the Pozna\u0144 bishop.Hierarchia Catholica, Volume 1, Page 408 As a bishop he began reconstruction in the Gothic style of the Pozna\u0144 Cathedral and surrounded S\u0142upca with walls. In politics, he was asking for favors and further assignments for the bishopric of the Mazovian Piasts, but otherwise he did not show any particular political line. In the consciousness of successive generations, his negative picture was fixed by Janek of Czarnk\u00f3w, who described him as a dishonest and corrupt man. He died on March 18, 1382, in Ci\u0105\u017ce\u0144, he was buried in the Pozna\u0144 cathedral. ==References== Category:Bishops of Pozna\u0144 Category:Year of birth unknown Category:14th-century births Category:1346 deaths Category:14th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Medieval Polish nobility Category:14th-century Polish people ",
