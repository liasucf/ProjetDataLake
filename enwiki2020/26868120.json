In 1799 he was appointed to a foreign corps, originally known as \"Stuart's\", or the Minorca Regiment, raised in that island by Sir John Stuart afterwards Count of Maida, with Lyon and Nicholas Trant as majors. The corps was successively known as the queen's German regiment and the 97th (queen's), and was disbanded as the 96th (queen's) in 1818. Lyon was with it in 1801 in Egypt, where it was engaged with Bonaparte's \"invincibles\" at the Battle of Alexandria on 21 March 1801, and was highly distinguished. Lyon subsequently commanded the regiment in the Peninsula from 1808 to 1811 at the battles of Vimeiro, Talavera, Busaco, and the first siege of Badajoz. In June 1813 he was sent to Germany to assist in organising the new Hanoverian levies (distinct from the King's German Legion), and was present at the operations in the north of Germany in 1813\u201314, under the prince royal of Sweden.
