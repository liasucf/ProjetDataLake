Gil S\u00e1nchez Mu\u00f1oz y Carb\u00f3n, was one of the antipopes of the Avignon Papacy, reigning from 10 June 1423 to 26 July 1429 as Clement VIII. He was born in Teruel between 1369\u20131370George L. Williams, Papal Genealogy: The Families And Descendants Of The Popes, (McFarland & Co. Inc., 1998), 234. and a member of the Avignon curia. When Alfonso V of Aragon reached an agreement with Pope Martin V, Sanchez Mu\u00f1oz abdicated, made his submission and was appointed bishop of Mallorca. He died on 28 December 1446. ==Biography== He was a friend and advisor of the future Avignon Pope Benedict XIII, and member of the Avignon curia. In 1396 he was an envoy to the Bishop of Valencia to get Spanish support. Benedict had appointed four cardinals, and on his death, three of them, on 10 June 1423, elected Sanchez Mu\u00f1oz as Pope.Miranda, Salvador. \"Antipope Clement VIII (1423-1429)\", Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, Florida International University] The fourth, Jean Carrier, absent at the time, declared the election invalid, and elected his own antipope in turn, who took the name Benedict XIV. Consequently, Jean Carrier was excommunicated by Clement VIII.Michael J. Walsh, Lives of the popes: Illustrated biographies of every Pope from St Peter to the present, (Barnes & Noble Books, 1998), 183. Clement VIII's fate was bound up with the ambitions of Alfonso V of Aragon. Alfonso wished to negotiate for Naples, and so gave Clement support; his queen Maria of Castile, and the Aragonese bishops supported Martin V. In the summer of 1423 Alfonso persuaded the Republic of Siena to acknowledge Clement VIII, thus securing recognition for the pope of the Avignon line in the very city, Pavia, which was part of the Republic of Siena, where the Roman pope Martin V had convened an ecumenical council of the Church. However, through the exertions of Cardinal Pierre de Foix, an able diplomat and relation of the king\u2019s, an agreement was reached between Alfonso and the Pope. Alfonso then sent a delegation in 1428 (headed by Alfonso de Borgia, the future Callixtus III), to persuade Clement to recognise Martin. Clement declared his abdication on 26 July 1429 and had his cardinals elect Oddo di Colonna (Martin V) his successor, a formal act precluding future doubts concerning apostolic succession. His abdication was confirmed in mid-August. Clement had to make a penitential submission in forma to Martin V, and when this was done Martin granted Sanchez Mu\u00f1oz the Bishopric of Mallorca.John-Peter Pham, Heirs of the Fisherman: Behind the Scenes of Papal Death and Succession, (Oxford University Press, 2004), 331. Sanchez Mu\u00f1oz died on 28 December 1446. ==See also== * Papal selection before 1059 * Papal conclave (since 1274) ==References== Clement VIII Clement 08 Category:1369 births Category:15th-century antipopes ",
