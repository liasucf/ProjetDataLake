    "text": "Peluza Ro\u015f-Albastr\u0103 was a group of Romanian football supporters which was dissolved in 2020. == Formation == The legendary ultras groups of Peluza Nord and Peluza Sud chose to remain neutral or support CSA Steaua Bucharest in the Fourth Romanian league after the dispute between owner of Fotbal Club FCSB (former FC Steaua Bucharest) and the major multi-sports club run by the Ministry of National Defence. This action led to a new ultras group wanting to fill the void. During the infamous FC FCSB - Manchester City 2016 match, Dinamo Bucharest ultras successfully tricked home fans of FC FCSB to wear their colors and a message saying Doar Dinamo Bucuresti (Only Dinamo Bucharest).Former members of Peluza Nord and other fans wanted to take revenge and founded a new ultras group. == Peluza Ro\u015f-Albastr\u0103's stance over the identity dispute == Unlike most Peluza Nord and Peluza Sud members who are either neutral or take the side of CSA Steaua Bucharest, Peluza Ros-Albastra support FCSB in this dispute, claiming it is the historical team that was founded on 7 June 2003 and has all the history and trophies. Because of this divergence in opinion, the ultras and fans alike are on two opposite sides. One side is claiming that CSA Steaua Bucharest is the true successor of the legendary team, the other claim it is FCSB. Even with this on-going dispute over identity, FCSB still enjoys huge popularity, remaining among the biggest football clubs in the country. == Controversies == Peluza Ro\u015f-Albastr\u0103 had its fair share of controversies from being accused of getting paid by owner Gigi Becali,tricking their supporters to pay an extra fee for tickets to fund a choreography that was never shown and disputes between smaller ultras groups over the control of the stand. During a November 2018 derby between FCSB and Dinamo Bucharest, Peluza Ro\u015f-Albastr\u0103 asked fans to pay an extra 5 lei for a supposed choreography ahead of the big derby. During the game, the ultras only showed a few banners. Many fans felt robbed and wondered where the money went. Ultras group Old Fans was one of the few organized groups within Peluza Ro\u015f- Albastr\u0103 alongside Renegades. Because of a dispute over the leadership of the stand, the Old Fans group chose to leave the stand and participate in home games by staying in the tribune or Peluza I of the stadium instead of Peluza II. During a 2017 clash between FCSB and FC Viktoria Plzen, the two groups stood on opposite sides of the stadium. This didn't last long since Old Fans didn't enjoy huge popularity and slowly faded. After owner Gigi Becali praised rival fans of Dinamo Bucharest and made public statements about missing the old Ultras groups of Peluza Nord and Peluza Sud, Peluza Ro\u015f-Albastr\u0103 chose to organize a protest against the owner and club by not attending either home or away games. The conflict was settled once the owner apologized for his comments. == Fanbase and groups == Peluza Ro\u015f-Albastr\u0103 consists of a handful of organized groups, Oltenita mereu prezenti and Tinerii tin viu fenomenul. Various groups such as Smokers,Old Fans,Renegades and Elite 47 either dissolved or stopped attending matches. Most fans buying tickets in Peluza Ro\u015f-Albastr\u0103's stand are casual fans. Because of the confusion during this dispute of identity,some ultras from various old-school brigades chose to attend FCSB games and show support.During away games, the team enjoys huge support from fans across the country, usually filling the stadium since the majority consider this team to be the real Steaua Bucharest. == Dissolution in 2020 == After Gheorge Mustata,one of the leadears from Peluza Nord was released from jail in 2020,he returned to FCSB and declared that Peluza Nord is back.Peluza Ros Albastra was dissolved and a new group arose by the name of \"Tornado 47\" __INDEX__ ==References== Category:Association football supporters' associations ",
