    "text": "Donald Donoher (born January 21, 1932) is an American retired college basketball coach and athletics administrator. He served as the head men's basketball coach at the University of Dayton from 1964 to 1989, compiling a record of 437\u2013275. His Dayton Flyers were champions of the 1968 National Invitation Tournament and runners-up at the 1967 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament. Donoher was also the athletic director at Dayton from 1976 to 1980. ==Early years== Donoher began his career as a basketball player at Central Catholic High School in Toledo, Ohio from 1947 to 1950. He played three years of varsity basketball for coach Tom Blackburn at the University of Dayton, scoring 578 career points in 72 games. Following graduation from Dayton in 1954, Donoher served a two-year enlistment in the United States Army. Returning to Dayton after the end of his service, Donoher accepted a part-time basketball scout position offered by Blackburn. In February 1963, Blackburn made Donoher the University's first full-time assistant coach. Blackburn had been suffering from cancer for most of the 1963\u201364 season. When the disease's effects became too debilitating for him to continue, Donoher took over as interim coach for the last three games of the season. In March 1964, Blackburn died from cancer, and Donoher was formally named his successor. However, Dayton credits the entire 1963\u201364 season to Blackburn. ==Head coaching experience== Donoher enjoyed immediate success as a head coach, going 22\u20137 in his inaugural season and guiding the Flyers to a berth in the NCAA tournament, reaching the Sweet Sixteen. Two years later, Donoher's Flyers defeated Western Kentucky University, the University of Tennessee, Virginia Tech, and the University of North Carolina en route to a national runner-up finish in the NCAA tournament. During his tenure at Dayton, Donoher guided the Flyers to the NCAA tournament eight times, reaching the Sweet Sixteen five times, the Elite Eight twice, and the national final once. Additionally, Dayton played in seven NIT post-season competitions under Donoher, winning the championship in 1968.http://www.collegesports.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/dayt/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/postseason Donoher is Dayton's all-time winningest coach with a 437\u2013275 record (.614), including a 20\u201316 post season record (.556).https://web.archive.org/web/20051025020647/http://www.ncaa.org/stats/m_basketball/coaching/all_d1_coaching_records.pdf Donoher-coached teams were noted for their discipline, tenacity, and sound fundamentals, frequently besting teams with greater athleticism.
