    "text": "The 2015 South Norfolk District Council election was held on Thursday 7 May 2015 to elect the whole council as part of 2015 United Kingdom local elections coinciding with the general election. The council continued to consist of 46 councillors and as immediately after the previous election, the council was controlled by local Conservatives, with local Liberal Democrats being the only opposition. The governing group's numbers were augmented by two councillors at the expense of that opposition group. Three defecting-from-majority independent councillors lost their council seats. ==Composition of council seats before election== After the 2011 election, 38 councillors were Conservatives and 8 were Liberal Democrats. Since then, three Conservative councillors have left the party's grouping. Two of them (Keith Weeks, Bressingham and Burston ward, and Jon Herbert, Mulbarton ward) now form the South Norfolk Independent Group, while the third (Terry Blowfield, Stratton ward) sits as an independent. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=2| Party !
