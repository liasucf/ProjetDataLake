The campaign saw the team attempt to improve upon its 12\u20132 record from 1968. The season is notable for being the last for the AFL, which merged into the NFL in . The Raiders stormed to a 12\u20131\u20131 record in 1969. They led the league in wins for a third consecutive season; in doing so, they posted a staggering 37\u20134\u20131 record over their final three years of AFL play. The season would end with an upset loss to the eventual Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs in the AFL Championship Game. Additionally, the season marked the debut of Hall-of-Fame head coach John Madden, previously the linebacker coach, promoted after the January departure of John Rauch for Buffalo. Madden led the Raiders to seven division titles, seven AFL/AFC Championship Games, and a Super Bowl championship before leaving after 1978, his tenth as head coach, with a regular season record. ==Regular season== ===Schedule=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
