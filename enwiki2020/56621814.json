They were ordered as part of a naval construction program directed at France's rivals, Italy and Germany, particularly after Italy made progress in modernizing its own fleet. The plan was also intended to remedy a deficiency in cruisers that had been revealed during training exercises in the 1880s. As such, the Friant-class cruisers were intended to operate as fleet scouts and in the French colonial empire. The ships were armed with a main battery of six guns supported by four guns and they had a top speed of . Friant and Chasseloup-Laubaut initially served with the Northern Squadron, while Bugeaud operated in the cruiser force of the Mediterranean Squadron, France's main battle fleet. Bugeaud became the flagship of the Levant Division in 1898, which operated as part of the International Squadron that intervened in the Cretan Revolt of 1897\u20131898. All three members of the class were sent to East Asia in response to the Boxer Uprising in Qing China by 1901, and they remained in the region through the mid-1900s. Bugeaud was badly worn out by her time in the Far East, and she was sold for scrap in 1907. That year, Chasseloup-Laubat visited the United States during the Jamestown Exposition. Chasseloup-Laubat was reduced to a storage hulk in 1911, but Friant remained in active service through the start of World War I in August 1914. She operated with cruiser squadrons patrolling for German commerce raiders early in the war and was later sent to patrol the formerly-German colony of Kamerun. Chasseloup-Laubat was converted into a distilling ship to support the main French fleet at Corfu while Friant ended the war having been rebuilt into a repair ship. The latter vessel was sold for scrap in 1920, while Chasseloup-Laubat ultimately foundered in 1926 after having been abandoned in the bay of Nouadhibou, French Mauritania. ==Design== ironclad , the threat of which prompted the French naval program of 1890 In the late 1880s, the Italian (Royal Navy) accelerated construction of ships for its fleet and reorganized the most modern ironclad battleships\u2014the and es\u2014into a fast squadron suitable for offensive operations. These developments provoked a strong response in the French press. The Budget Committee in the French Chamber of Deputies began to press for a \"two-power standard\" in 1888, which would see the French fleet enlarged to equal the combined Italian and German fleets, then France's two main rivals on the continent. This initially came to nothing, as the supporters of the doctrine called for a fleet largely based on squadrons of torpedo boats to defend the French coasts rather than an expensive fleet of ironclads. This view had significant support in the Chamber of Deputies. The next year, a war scare with Italy led to further demands to strengthen the fleet. The visit of a German squadron of four ironclads to Italy compounded French concerns about a combined Italo-German fleet that would dramatically outnumber their own. Training exercises held in France that year demonstrated that the slower French fleet would be unable to prevent the faster Italian squadron from bombarding the French coast at will, in part because it lacked enough cruisers (and doctrine to use them) to scout for the enemy ships. To correct the weaknesses of the French fleet, on 22 November 1890, the Superior Naval Council authorized a new construction program directed not at simple parity with the Italian and German fleets, but numerical superiority. In addition to twenty-four new battleships, a total of seventy cruisers were to be built for use in home waters and overseas in the French colonial empire. The Friant class were the first group of protected cruisers to be authorized under the program. ===General characteristics and machinery=== alt=Simple sketch of a ship with a bulbous bow, two large masts, three smoke stacks, and four elliptical sponsons projecting from the sides of the vessel to carry the guns. The ships of the Friant class were long between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draft of . They displaced . The ships' hulls featured a pronounced ram bow and a tumblehome shape, which were common characteristics of major French warships of the period. They had a forecastle deck that extended for almost the entire length of the ship, terminating with a short quarterdeck aft and a sloped stern. Their superstructure consisted of a main conning tower with a bridge forward and a smaller, secondary conning tower aft. Each ship was originally to be fitted with a pair of heavy military masts with fighting tops, but stability problems with forced them to be replaced with lighter pole masts carrying only observation positions. Steering was controlled by a single rudder. was fitted with bilge keels to improve her stability. Their crew consisted of 339 officers and enlisted men. The ships' propulsion system consisted of a pair of triple-expansion steam engines driving two screw propellers. Steam was provided by twenty coal-burning water- tube boilers of the Niclausse type for Friant and the Lagrafel d'Allest type for Chasseloup-Laubat, while Bugeaud received twenty-four Belleville boilers. All of the ships' boiler rooms were ducted into three funnels. Their machinery was rated to produce for a top speed of . During sea trials, reached . Coal storage amounted to , which provided a cruising range of at a speed of . ===Armament and armor=== A Model 1891 gun in a pivot mount The ships were armed with a main battery of six 45-caliber guns. They were placed in individual pivot mounts; one was on the forecastle, two were in sponsons abreast the conning tower, another pair were in sponsons just forward of the aft conning tower, and the last was on the stern. They were supplied with a variety of shells, including solid, cast iron projectiles, and explosive armor-piercing (AP) and semi-armor-piercing (SAP) shells that weighed and , respectively. The guns fired with a muzzle velocity of . The ships' offensive armament was augmented by a secondary battery of four Mod\u00e8le 1891 guns, which were carried in pivot mounts in the conning towers, one on each side per tower. The guns fired cast iron and AP shells with a muzzle velocity of . All of the primary and secondary guns were fitted with gun shields to protect their crews. The offensive weaponry was rounded out by two torpedo tubes that were carried in their hulls above the waterline, one on either side. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, they carried a battery of numerous small-caliber, quick-firing guns. This comprised four 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and eleven 1-pounder guns, all in individual mounts. The former were carried in pairs in the forward and aft conning towers on the upper deck; the latter were distributed around the ships, including atop the sponsons for the main guns and higher in the superstructure. Armor protection consisted of a curved armor deck that was thick on the flat, which increased to on the sloped sides, where it provided a measure of vertical protection. Above the deck at the sides, a cofferdam filled with cellulose was intended to contain flooding from damage below the waterline. Below the main deck, a thin splinter deck covered the propulsion machinery spaces to protect them from shell fragments. Their forward conning towers had thick plating on the sides. The gun shields were thick. ==Construction== Bugeaud early in her career {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=\"120\" | Name ! width=\"90\" | Laid down ! width=\"90\" | Launched ! width=\"90\" | Completed ! width=\"90\" | Shipyard |- | | 1891 | 17 April 1893 | April 1895 | , Brest |- | | June 1891 | 29 August 1893 | May 1896 | , Cherbourg |- | | June 1891 | 17 April 1893 | 1895 | , Cherbourg |} ==Service history== Bugeaud leading ships of the International Squadron to Crete in 1898 Friant and Chasseloup-Laubat spent their first years in service assigned to the Northern Squadron, based in the English Channel. Bugeaud was instead assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron, France's primary battle fleet. In both units, the ships were primarily occupied with training exercises. In 1898, Bugeaud transferred to serve as the flagship of the Levant Division in the eastern Mediterranean. During that time, she participated in the International Squadron, composed of ships from several of the Great Powers, that intervened in the Cretan Revolt of 1897\u20131898. Bugeaud was deployed to East Asia by early 1900 in response to the Boxer Uprising, and the other two members of the class had followed her there by 1901, and they remained in the region after the conflict ended. After returning to France in the mid-1900s, Friant received new boilers and thereafter returned to fleet operations. Meanwhile, the poor shipyard facilities in the Far East prevented sufficient maintenance being done for Bugeaud, and she was in a poor state by 1907. Unable to economically repair her, the French Navy struck the ship from the naval register and sold her for scrap. That year, Chasseloup-Laubat took part in a visit to the United States for the Jamestown Exposition. She was later hulked in 1911 and disarmed in 1913. At the start of World War I in August 1914, Friant was on station in France's colonies in the Americas. She was initially assigned to a cruiser squadron to patrol the western end of the English Channel. In September, she was moved to French Morocco to join a group of cruisers patrolling for German commerce raiders. At some point after the start of the conflict, Chasseloup- Laubat was converted into a distilling ship to support the main French fleet at Corfu. Friant was later moved to the Gulf of Guinea to patrol Germany's colony of Kamerun in western Africa. She ended the war having been converted into a repair ship based in Morocco and later at Mudros to support a flotilla of submarines. She was struck from the naval register in 1920 and sold to ship breakers. Chasseloup-Laubat was sent to Port Etienne, French Mauritania, to supply the colony with water and eventually sank in 1926 in the bay of Nouadhibou after having been abandoned. ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Cruiser classes Category:Ships built in France Category:World War I cruisers of France Category:1890s ships ",
