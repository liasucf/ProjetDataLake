    "text": "Ronald Baxter Henry (August 7, 1936 \u2013 May 14, 2016) was an American professional baseball player. He was a catcher who spent one full season (1961) and part of another (1964) in Major League Baseball as a member of the Minnesota Twins. He threw and batted right-handed, stood tall, and weighed . Henry's career lasted for 15 seasons (1954\u201368). The first seven were spent in the farm system of the Milwaukee Braves. He was chosen in the 1960 Rule 5 draft after batting .310 for the Austin Senators of the Double-A Texas League, and spent the entire 1961 campaign with the Twins in their first season in the Twin Cities. He was the club's third-string catcher (behind Earl Battey and Hal Naragon) and played in only 20 games, 14 as a pinch hitter. Henry batted only .143 with four hits, then spent the next 2 seasons in the minor leagues until his recall to Minnesota in June 1964. With Battey, a five-time American League All-Star, still entrenched as the Twins' regular receiver, Henry's opportunities again were limited. He appeared in 22 games, 13 as a catcher, and logged 41 at bats. He hit his only two Major League home runs, off Don Lee and Dave Vineyard, but made only three other hits. Altogether, Henry appeared in 42 MLB games, with nine hits in 69 at bats. He resumed his minor league playing career in 1965. Henry died on May 14, 2016, aged 79, in Denver, Colorado, of cardiovascular disease and end stage renal disease. ==References== ==External links== Category:1936 births Category:2016 deaths Category:African-American baseball players Category:Austin Senators players Category:Baseball players from Pennsylvania Category:Boise Pilots players Category:Charlotte Hornets (baseball) players Category:Chester High School alumni Category:Corpus Christi Clippers players Category:Dallas-Fort Worth Rangers players Category:Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs players Category:Denver Bears players Category:Louisville Colonels (minor league) players Category:Major League Baseball catchers Category:Minnesota Twins players Category:Oklahoma City 89ers players Category:People from Delaware County, Pennsylvania Category:Sportspeople from Chester, Pennsylvania Category:Topeka Hawks players Category:Toronto Maple Leafs (International League) players Category:Vancouver Mounties players Category:Wellsville Braves players Category:Wichita Braves players ",
