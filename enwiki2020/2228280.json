    "text": "Houston Harris (July 10, 1924 \u2013 January 20, 1998) was an American professional wrestler, better known by his ring name Bobo Brazil. Credited with breaking down barriers of racial segregation in professional wrestling, Harris is considered one of the first successful African-American professional wrestlers.Google Books Jackie Robinson reference == Early life == Houston Harris was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, but later lived in East St. Louis, Illinois, and Benton Harbor, Michigan. He played baseball in the Negro Leagues for The House of David, where he was discovered to become a wrestler at a steel mill. == Professional wrestling career == Harris was trained by Joe Savoldi after meeting him at matches at the Naval Armory. Savoldi originally named Harris, BuBu Brasil, \"The South American Giant,\" but a promoter misprinted his first name as \"Bobo\" in an advertisement and it stuck. Brazil would have many matches with competitors such as Killer Kowalski, Dick the Bruiser, Johnny Valentine, and The Sheik, who feuded with Brazil over the course of several decades. These and other rivals would all fall victim to Brazil's finishing maneuver, the Coco Butt. Brazil also once wrestled Bill Miller to a draw, and challenged Bruno Sammartino for the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship in a battle of two top babyface competitors. On October 18, 1962, Brazil defeated \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers by hitting him in the groin causing Rogers to be unable to continue. Brazil refused the championship and they met a couple of weeks later and Rogers won. At the time the promoters were working a gimmick where the champ would be hit in the groin and the challenger wouldn't accept the title. The same scenario occurred in Toronto two weeks earlier with Bruno Sammartino and Rogers. Neither Brazil, nor Sammartino were officially recognized by the NWA as having won the World Heavyweight Championship. (This distinction is usually given to Ron Simmons, the first recognized African American world champion after winning the WCW World Heavyweight Championship). On October 9, 1970, Brazil and El Mongol defeated Mr. Ito and The Great Ota in the first racially mixed match in Atlanta history. Brazil served as a mentor to wrestler \"Soulman\" Rocky Johnson. Brazil's manager was James Dudley, the first African American to be in charge of a major arena in the United States. Dudley would run to the ring waving a towel, as Brazil followed behind. Brazil retired in 1993 after a four-decade career. His last official match was in Chicago, Illinois against Kelly Kiniski, son of rival Gene Kiniski. Brazil was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame class of 1994 by Ernie Ladd. The following year, Brazil inducted Ladd into the WWF Hall of Fame. == Personal life and death == Harris had a wife and six children. After retiring from wrestling, he ran a restaurant called Bobo's Grill. His son Karl wrestles as Bobo Brazil Jr. in the independent circuit. As of 2019 he still wrestles at 67 years old. Harris died on January 20, 1998, at the Lakeland Medical Center in St. Joseph, Michigan. He had been admitted to the hospital on January 14, after suffering a series of strokes. == Championships and accomplishments == * Big Time Wrestling (Detroit) ** NWA United States Heavyweight Championship (Detroit version) (9 times) ** NWA World Tag Team Championship (Detroit version) (8 times) \u2013 with Art Thomas (1), Bill Miller (1), Athol Layton (1), The Stomper (1), Tony Marino (3) and Fred Curry (1) *Big Time Wrestling (San Francisco) ** NWA United States Heavyweight Championship (San Francisco version) (1 time) * Championship Wrestling from Florida ** NWA Florida Tag Team Championship (2 times) \u2013 with Sweet Brown Sugar (1) and Dusty Rhodes (1) * Eastern Sports Association ** ESA North American Heavyweight Championship (1 time) * Japan Wrestling Association ** NWA International Heavyweight Championship (1 time, 1st reign is unofficially Recognised) * Maple Leaf Wrestling ** NWA Canadian Open Tag Team Championship (1 time) \u2013 with Whipper Billy Watson ** NWA United States Heavyweight Championship (Toronto version) (1 time) * Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling ** NWA United States Heavyweight Championship (Mid- Atlantic version) (1 time) * Midwest Wrestling Association (Ohio) ** MWA Ohio Heavyweight Championship (1 time) ** MWA Ohio Tag Team Championship (3 times) \u2013 with Frankie Talaber * National Wrestling Alliance ** NWA Hall of Fame (Class of 2013) * NWA Hollywood Wrestling/Worldwide Wrestling Associates ** NWA Americas Heavyweight Championship (3 times) ** NWA \"Beat the Champ\" Television Championship (1 time) ** NWA International Television Tag Team Championship (4 times) \u2013 with Wilbur Snyder (2), Sandor Szabo (1), and Primo Carnera (1) ** NWA Pacific Coast Heavyweight Championship (Los Angeles version) (1 time) ** WWA World Heavyweight Championship (2 times) * Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum ** Television Era (Class of 2008) * Pro Wrestling Illustrated ** PWI Editor's Award (1998) * Superstars of Wrestling ** SoW United States Heavyweight Championship (1 time) * World Wrestling Association (Indianapolis) ** WWA World Heavyweight Championship (2 times) ** WWA World Tag Team Championship (1 time) \u2013 with Chris Carter * World Wide Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Federation ** WWWF United States Heavyweight Championship (7 times) ** WWF Hall of Fame (Class of 1994) * Wrestling Observer Newsletter ** Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame (Class of 1996) * Other championships ** World Negro Heavyweight Championship (2 times) == References == == External links == * * Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame profile (archived) * Category:1924 births Category:1998 deaths Category:20th-century American male actors Category:African-American male professional wrestlers Category:American male professional wrestlers Category:NWA/WCW/WWE United States Heavyweight Champions Category:Professional wrestlers from Arkansas Category:Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum Category:Sportspeople from Little Rock, Arkansas Category:WWE Hall of Fame inductees ",
