Max attended public schools on Monroe and Henry Streets. After school, Max had to work as an errand boy and a newsboy to help support his family financially. After leaving school and while still in his teens, he went to Denver, where he engaged in cattle dealing. After remaining there for six years, he returned to New York City and married. He then began his entrepreneurship on a grand scale, beginning \"his business career as a poor boy and [making] a fortune in the manufacture and sale of bottles, cider, vinegar, and sacramental wines, among various other business ventures and real estate dealings.\" == Business ventures == Grifenhagen Bros. & Co., Inc. business card #2 Grifenhagen Bros & Co.

This is the building that the Duffey's (Duffey-Mott) lived in for many years. == Political life == === Alderman === In 1904, representing the Washington Heights district, Max became a Republican Alderman, serving for five years. In 1907, he became chairman of the Committee on Buildings of the Board of Alderman. ==== Building Code revisions ==== Sheriff's Badge of Max Samuel Grifenhagen Max's efforts to have the Building Code revised were highly praised. Max believed that \"a small auxiliary committee of experts can be more effective than the larger one which it is possible to employ under the terms of the resolution of the Board.\" In revising the code, Max believed that it \"should be based upon thoroughly scientific grounds, taking advantage of the latest developments in municipal architecture, in sanitation and in civil engineering\". In addition to taking advantage of the latest innovation and technology, Max's revisions to the Code also encouraged and ensured the creation of a more beautiful New York City; \"It should not be forgotten that, at the same time, the artistic considerations should be always kept in view. Changes can be made in the Building Code which if properly considered would go far to improve the artistic character of New York City. We have many restrictions in our Code for the purely material side of affairs, but few which are based upon the principles of beauty. In every great foreign metropolis such restrictions are re\u00e7ognized and made part of the Code\u2014in some instances even being given first consideration.\" === New York County Register === In 1909, running on the Republican-Fusion Ticket, Max was elected New York County Register. He made many changes in the property registration methods of the office.Old business card of Sheriff Max Grifenhagen === New York County Sheriff === In 1913, again running as a Republican-Fusion candidate, he was elected Sheriff. During his term, Harry Thaw and police lieutenant Charles Becker were among his prisoners. Harry Thaw was the murderer of the renowned architect Stanford White. Charles Becker was the first American police officer to ever receive the death penalty. The scandal that surrounded his arrest, conviction, and execution was one of the most important in Progressive Era New York City. ==== Changes in Fee System under Sheriff Max S. Grifenhagen ==== Collection of hundreds of congratulation letters sent to Max when he was elected Sheriff While serving as Sheriff, Max urged that a law be passed providing for payment of Sheriff's fees into the public treasury instead of to the Sheriff. He held that the Sheriff's remuneration was excessive. He was the first Sheriff of New York County to reveal what the fees and salary amounted to, saying that he received $113k for his first two years in office ($113k in 1915 = $2.72 mil in 2017). In May 1916, a few months after Max retired from office, Governor Whitman signed a bill abolishing payment of fees to Sheriffs, to take effect after the term of Alfred E. Smith, Max's successor. Max was key in bringing an end to the corruptible practice of paying fees directly to the Sheriff. === Political agenda and charity === Because of his poverty-stricken childhood, Max was always passionate about helping the poor. This was apparent throughout his political life; he pushed to establish medical clinics, parks, and playgrounds on the East Side of New York City. He was also a liberal contributor to charity. Max was very active in the affairs of the Hebrew Orphan Asylum and gave considerable sums toward its upkeep. Max was a trustee for the last twenty five years of his life and was the third oldest member of the board at his death. He was also the second oldest member of the congregation of Temple Israel of the City of New York. In 1918, Max was urged to run for Congress, but declined. He took an active interest in Republican affairs until his death, however, often making campaign speeches. He belonged to the National Republican Club and the Riverside Republican Club, and was a founder of the New York County Republican Club. == Retirement and late life == thumb === Stonehurst === Stonehurst, Max's summer home, Freeport, Long Island Stonehurst, Max's summer home, Freeport, Long Island In 1913, Max Grifenhagen purchased \"Stonehurst\", a house in Freeport, as a summer residence.

The headline states \"The Apple Doesn't Fall Far From the Tree\", implying that Max was continuing the righteous, selfless, outgoing and involved life that his grandfather Rabbi Mendel Menachem Grifenhagen maintained in the German town of Wollstein in the Posen Province, Prussia, Germany, now Wolsztyn, Poland. Max's grandfather, Rabbi Mendel Menachem, was the administrator of the local and renowned Talmud Academy. He was described in this article as being \"famous...one of the great Rabbis of Germany from Pozna\u0144.\" He was a Rabbi for over 60 years and lived well past 90 years of age. The paper stated that \"Max possesses all the traits of being a relative of such a great man.\" The article also describes Max's father, Benjamin, as being \"a great student in the works of God and in Judaic studies.\" It described his mother as a \"fine woman from one of the Heildesheimer and/or Mischpocha families (we are unsure if this was the name of her community or a family name). == References == Category:Politicians from Chicago Category:New York (state) Republicans Category:Sheriffs of New York County, New York Category:1861 births Category:1932 deaths Category:American people of German-Jewish descent ",
