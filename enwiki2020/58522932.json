    "text": "Philippe Myers (born January 25, 1997) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman who currently plays for the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL). ==Playing career== He was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Flyers on September 21, 2015. After his stellar play during the 2015\u201316 QMJHL season, NHL scouts believed he would have been a first-round pick in the 2016 NHL Entry Draft if the Flyers had not signed him. He made his NHL debut on February 17, 2019. ==International play== Myers first represented Canada on the international stage at the 2017 World Junior Championships, held in Montreal-Toronto, Canada. He registered 3 assists in just 4 games as Canada claimed the Silver Medal as the host nation, losing the final to the United States. Myers was a late inclusion to join Team Canada at the 2019 World Championships underway in Slovakia on May 15, 2019. Recalled to the squad as an injury replacement for Brandon Montour, Myers made his full international debut in a 5\u20132 round-robin victory over France on May 16, 2019. Myers helped Canada progress through to the playoff rounds before losing the final to Finland to finish with the Silver Medal on May 26, 2019. He finished the tournament posting 1 assist from the blueline in 7 games. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"96\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"96\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
