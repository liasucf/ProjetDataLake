    "text": "William Robert Flood (born 10 April 1985) is an Irish former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He earned 15 caps for his country at under-20 and under-21 levels. He represented eight clubs in England and Scotland including Manchester City, Cardiff City, Dundee United, Celtic, Middlesbrough and Aberdeen. ==Early life== Flood was born in Dublin and grew up on a housing estate in the Ballyfermot area of the city. Flood started off his early career with Cherry Orchard before joining Manchester City. At the age of 14, Flood dislocated his patella playing in the All-Ireland Final. He described it as \"very sore\". Cherry Orchard won the final and Flood received a winners' medal, which was his only one until winning the Scottish League Cup in 2014 with Aberdeen. While at Cherry Orchard, Flood was mentored by Barry Pointon, who had known Flood since he was 15. Flood's Performances for Cherry Orchard attracted interest from Celtic, Manchester United and Arsenal, but he joined Manchester City. ==Club career== ===Manchester City=== When he joined Manchester City and signed a professional contract, Flood had injuries sorted by the club's medical team and quote: \"If it wasn't for them I wouldn't be playing football\"'. After breaking through into the first team in 2002, he was sent out on loan spells to Rochdale and then Coventry City. Flood made his debut in the qualifying round of the 2003\u201304 UEFA Cup, in a 7\u20130 aggregate win over Total Network Solutions. His first career goal came in September 2004 when he scored Manchester City's third goal in a 7\u20131 win against Barnsley in the Football League Cup. Later in the 2003\u201304 season, Flood joined Rochdale on a month's loan. He scored his first career league goal for Manchester City in November 2004 in a 1\u20131 draw at home to Norwich City. Manager Kevin Keegan was impressed with Flood's display following his performance. Following this performance, Flood signed a contract with Manchester City, up until 2007. In the 2005\u201306 season, Flood joined Championship side Coventry City on a month's loan which was later Extended into a second month. Flood scored his second career league goal in September 2005, in a 3\u20131 win at home to Watford. ===Cardiff City=== Flood joined Cardiff City for a fee of \u00a3200,000, paid in separate instalments, in 2006 and made 25 appearances for the Bluebirds. He scored just once for Cardiff, a memorable winning goal at Elland Road in August 2006. However, after struggling to settle at Ninian Park, he joined Dundee United on a season-long loan for the 2007/08 season as Cardiff manager Dave Jones wished to see how Flood would perform over a long season of first- team football. ====Dundee United (loans)==== Flood's debut resulted in a red card before half time on the opening day of the season, after collecting two cautions, and his second match, for the reserves, resulted in the same outcome. On this occasion, Flood was \"bizarrely sent off...for taking a quick free kick when the referee was apparently not ready.\" On 15 December 2007, he scored his first goal for Dundee United against St Mirren in a 3\u20130 win, a goal which later earned him the SPL Goal of the Season award. In follow-up interviews the next day, Flood said he would be disappointed to leave United at the end of the season, admitting he would be \"gutted because I have loved it here.\" Despite returning to Cardiff at the end of the season, a second season-long loan was agreed in July 2008. In the semi finals of the Scottish League Cup against Celtic, which finished 0\u20130 and went to a penalty shoot-out, Flood missed the eleventh penalty knocking Dundee United out of the competition. Four years on, Flood admitted that the penalty left him with bitter memories when he compared the penalty miss to Manchester United's match in the League Cup against Sunderland. When his move to Celtic came to light, Manager Craig Levein urged Flood to stay at Dundee United, rather than joining Celtic. ===Celtic=== Flood joined Celtic on 30 January 2009, signing a two- and-a-half-year contract for an undisclosed fee, for the team he supported as a boy.\"Celtic complete signing of Flood\" BBC Sport (30 January 2009) Upon joining the club, Flood's move to Celtic was not well received by Celtic's supporters, with some of them believing he was \"not good enough for Parkhead\". He made his debut for Celtic against Rangers on 15 February 2009 at Celtic Park, playing for just over an hour before being substituted. Flood commented that making his debut was a \"big shock\" for him. By the 2009\u201310 season, with Celtic under the management of Tony Mowbray, Flood found himself out of the first team and expressed unhappiness over this. At one point, Dundee United considered signing him, but the move did not materialise. Despite not being a first choice player, Flood made his Champions League debut when the club played against Arsenal in the Champions League Qualifying Round, coming on as substitute for Shaun Maloney in the 61st minute. The match ended with Arsenal winning 5\u20131 on aggregate. In December 2009, Flood admitted he \"regretted\" joining Celtic, describing it as \"a mistake\". After leaving Celtic, Flood stated he didn't consider himself as a Celtic player, citing his frustrating spells there. Despite this, he stated that Neil Lennon helped him keep his focus when he faced difficulties and for keeping him sane. ===Middlesbrough=== On 13 January 2010, it was announced that Flood had officially left Celtic for Middlesbrough, along with his teammates Barry Robson and Chris Killen.

Ahead of the 2010\u201311 season, Flood recovered from the knee injury and joined the club's pre-season. While in pre-season, Flood aimed to force his way back into the first team at Middlesbrough. However, he was ruled out early in the 2010\u201311 season after suffering a serious injury in Middlesbrough's opening league game against Ipswich Town. Flood was taken off before half time after a collision with teammate Matthew Bates with manager Strachan expressing sympathy for Flood. After six months out, Flood made his return to the first team training. Flood made his first appearance from injury when he played 60 minutes for the club's reserve Team against Leeds United reserves. Following the match, Flood was praised by Tony Mowbray on his return.

After the match, Flood had to make an apology to Manager Peter Houston via text. In a 3\u20131 loss against Rangers on 5 November 2011, Gregg Wylde received a red card after kicking Flood.
