    "text": "Lassina Diabat\u00e9 (born 16 September 1974) is a Ivorian former professional footballer. He played for Ivory Coast and a few clubs in Europe. He played primarily as a defensive midfielder but could also play as a centre back. Born in Bouak\u00e9, Ivory Coast, Diabat\u00e9 played for several clubs in France, including Perpignan FC, Bordeaux and Auxerre. In his time at Bordeaux he won Ligue 1 in the 1998\u201399 season. He was a participant at the 1998, 2000 and 2002 African Cup of Nations. He is best known for wearing fluorescent orange soccer boots, before such designs became fashionable. Diabat\u00e9 was signed by Portsmouth in October 2002. During his time in England with Portsmouth his manager Harry Redknapp described him as being \"as hard as iron\" and said: \"I wouldn't want to be a striker playing against him, he is a wonderfully aggressive player who controls the midfield for us\". He made 25 league appearances during Portsmouth's 2002\u201303 season after which they were promoted to the Premier League. He often struggled with injuries at various points in his career, which limited the amount of time he spent at each club. He failed to score a single goal in the last 7 years of his career. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:People from Bouak\u00e9 Category:Association football midfielders Category:Ivorian footballers Category:Ivory Coast international footballers Category:1998 African Cup of Nations players Category:2000 African Cup of Nations players Category:2002 African Cup of Nations players Category:Ligue 1 players Category:English Football League players Category:Belgian First Division A players Category:Olympique Al\u00e8s players Category:FC Girondins de Bordeaux players Category:AJ Auxerre players Category:Portsmouth F.C. players Category:AC Ajaccio players Category:Sint-Truidense V.V. players Category:FC Lausanne- Sport players Category:AS Cannes players Category:Bourges 18 players Category:Canet Roussillon FC players Category:Louhans-Cuiseaux FC players Category:Ivorian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in France Category:Expatriate footballers in Switzerland Category:Expatriate footballers in Belgium Category:Expatriate footballers in England ",
