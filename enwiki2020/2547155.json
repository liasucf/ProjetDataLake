    "text": "The P.M.R.C. Can Suck on This is an EP by the American punk rock band NOFX. It was originally released in 1987 through Wassail Records with hand-written labels (limited to 500 copies) and was re-released on January 1, 1990, through Fat Wreck Chords. The original version of the EP featured a black-and-white photo montage of Tammy Faye Bakker pegging then-husband (and televangelist) Jim Bakker as its cover, but was eventually changed to a picture of guitarist Eric Melvin playing on stage. The track \"Shut Up Already\" borrows a riff from the Led Zeppelin song \"Living Loving Maid\", while the Liberal Animation version ended with a riff from \"Black Dog\". All the tracks were compiled on the Longest EP compilation as tracks 26-30 respectively, where Johnny B. Goode appears at the end of \"The Punk Song\". ==Track listing== ===Side A=== #\"Dueling Retards\" (previously unreleased) #\"On the Rag\" (slightly different from the Liberal Animation version, lower quality recording) #\"A200 Club\" (slightly different from the Liberal Animation version, with extra lyrics) ===Side B=== #\"Shut Up Already\" (slightly different from the Liberal Animation version) #\"The Punk Song\" (previously unreleased) #\"Johnny B.
