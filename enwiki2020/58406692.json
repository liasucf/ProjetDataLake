He was called Se-li-ma-la-pi in the Chinese chronicle. == Biography == Maravijayottunggavarman started his reign around 1008 CE, when he was recorded to have sent three envoys to the emperor of China. Srivijaya was also in a good relationship with the Chola Empire, which at that time was under King Rajaraja I. The Leiden Inscription (1044 CE) mentions that Maravijayottunggavarman even built a Buddhist vihara known as Chudamani Vihara at Nagapattinam, dedicated to his late father's name. Chinese sources also speak of a major warfare between his kingdom and the Kingdom of Medang of East Java. In 1016 CE, Srivijaya may be assisting a rebellious vassal state of Medang, causing the death of King Dharmavangsa Teguh Anantavikrama and the destruction of Medang Kingdom. ==See also== * Srivijaya * Chudamani Vihara ==References== Category:Srivijaya Category:Shailendra dynasty Category:Indonesian Buddhist monarchs Category:11th-century monarchs in Asia ",
