    "text": "Betty May Nuthall Shoemaker (n\u00e9e Nuthall; 23 May 1911 \u2013 8 November 1983) was an English tennis player. Known for her powerful forehand, according to Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail, Nuthall was ranked in the world top ten in 1927, 1929 through 1931, and 1933, reaching a career high in those rankings of World No. 4 in 1929. She won the mixed doubles championships at the French Open in 1931 with Pat Spence. ==Career== Betty Nuthall in 1932 Nuthall's father taught her tennis. She won the junior championships of Great Britain in 1924 (aged 13), 1925 and 1926. In 1927 at the age of 16, Nuthall tied Elisabeth Moore as the then-youngest women's singles finalist ever at the U. S. National Championships. Nuthall lost the final to Helen Wills in straight sets while serving under-handed. Also in 1927, Nuthall played on the British Wightman Cup team and defeated Helen Jacobs in her debut. In her mixed doubles matches, the final of the Nottingham Championships, she won with her partner Pat Spence. She also represented Great Britain in the 1929 and 1931\u201334 Wightman Cup competitions. In 1930, Nuthall became the first non-American since 1892 to win a women's singles title at the U. S. National Championships, defeating Anna McCune Harper in straight sets. She was the last British female player to win the title until Virginia Wade won in 1968. In 1931, she reached the singles final of the French International Championships but lost in two sets to first-seeded Cilly Aussem. Also in 1930, she won the mixed doubles with her recurring partner Spence. Nuthall and he went for the British Hard Court Championships in April and were only eliminated in the final, while in May they won the mixed title at the French International Championships. At the U.S. Championships in 1933, Nuthall won a quarterfinal versus Alice Marble 6\u20138, 6\u20130, 7\u20135 after being down two breaks of serve at 1\u20135 in the final set. In the semifinal versus Moody, Nuthall won the first set 6\u20132 in just 12 minutes, which was the first set Wills had lost at this tournament since 1926. Moody, however, turned around the match and won the last two sets 6\u20133, 6\u20132 despite losing her serve twice in the second set. Nuthall never again reached the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam singles tournament. Nuthall won women's doubles titles at the 1930, 1931, and 1933 U.S. Championships and at the 1931 French Championships. She won mixed doubles championships at the 1929 and 1931 U.S. Championships and at the 1931 and 1932 French Championships. Nuthall was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1977. ==Personal life== She formed a real-life couple with her doubles partner Pat Spence, with whom she went on to win the French Open mixed doubles tournament in 1931. In 1954 she married Franklin Shoemaker, who died in 1982. On 8 November 1983 Nuthall died in New York of a coronary arrest. ==Grand Slam finals== ===Singles: 3 (1 title, 2 runners-up)=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- !style=\"width:40px\"|Result !style=\"width:40px\"|Year !style=\"width:200px\"|Championship !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:180px\"|Opponent !style=\"width:130px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |-bgcolor=\"#CCCCFF\" | style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss || 1927 || U.S. Championships || Grass || Helen Wills || 1\u20136, 4\u20136 |-bgcolor=\"#CCCCFF\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 1930 || U.S. Championships || Grass || Anna McCune Harper || 6\u20131, 6\u20134 |-bgcolor=\"#EBC2AF\" | style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss || 1931 || French Championships || Clay || Cilly Aussem || 6\u20138, 1\u20136 |} ===Doubles (4 titles, 2 runners-up)=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" !style=\"width:40px\"|Result !style=\"width:40px\"|Year !style=\"width:200px\"|Championship !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:180px\"|Partner !style=\"width:180px\"|Opponents !style=\"width:130px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |-style=\"background:#ccf;\" | style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss || 1927 || U.S. National Championships || Grass || Joan Fry || Kitty McKane Ermyntrude Harvey || 1\u20136, 6\u20134, 4\u20136 |-style=\"background:#ccf;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 1930 || U.S. National Championships || Grass || Sarah Palfrey || Edith Cross Anna McCune Harper || 3\u20136, 6\u20133, 7\u20135 |-style=\"background:#ebc2af;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 1931 || French Championships || Clay || Eileen Bennett Whittingstall || Cilly Aussem Elizabeth Ryan || 9\u20137, 6\u20132 |-style=\"background:#ccf;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 1931 || U.S. National Championships || Grass || Eileen Bennett Whittingstall || Helen Jacobs Dorothy Round || 6\u20132, 6\u20134 |-style=\"background:#ebc2af;\" | style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss || 1932 || French Championships || Clay || Eileen Bennett Whittingstall || Elizabeth Ryan Helen Wills || 1\u20136, 3\u20136 |-style=\"background:#ccf;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 1933 || U.S. National Championships || Grass || Freda James || Elizabeth Ryan Helen Wills || default |} ===Mixed doubles (4 titles, 1 runner-up)=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" !style=\"width:40px\"|Result !style=\"width:40px\"|Year !style=\"width:200px\"|Championship !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:180px\"|Partner !style=\"width:180px\"|Opponents !style=\"width:130px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |-style=\"background:#ccf;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 1929 || U.S. National Championships || Grass || George Lott || Phyllis Covell Bunny Austin || 6\u20133, 6\u20133 |-style=\"background:#ebc2af;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 1931 || French Championships || Clay || Patrick Spence || Dorothy Shepherd Bunny Austin || 6\u20133, 5\u20137, 6\u20133 |-style=\"background:#ccf;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 1931 || U.S. National Championships || Grass || George Lott || Anna McCune Harper Wilmer Allison || 6\u20133, 6\u20133 |-style=\"background:#ebc2af;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 1932 || French Championships || Clay || Fred Perry || Helen Wills Sidney Wood || 6\u20134, 6\u20132 |-style=\"background:#ccf;\" | style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss || 1933 || French Championships || Grass || Fred Perry || Margaret Scriven Jack Crawford || 2\u20136, 3\u20136 |} ==Grand Slam singles tournament timeline== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" !
