The venue has three cricket grounds called Platinum Oval, Golden Oval and Silver Oval. The 30 acres land for the facility was acquired in early-2000s by KM Ramprasad, who was the president of the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) during that time. The facility hosted its first official match in 2011, with the Royal Challengers-KSCA Academy moving to the venue soon after. In 2013, KSCA inaugurated the facility's Platinum Jubilee Pavilion which serves as a common pavilion for Golden and Silver Ovals. The facility has 22 practice pitches, and an indoor practice provision. ==Gallery== Three Ovals KSCA Stadium - entrance (cropped).jpg|Entrance of the Three Ovals KSCA Stadium Three Ovals KSCA Stadium - Platinum Oval 2.jpg|Platinum Oval Three Ovals KSCA Stadium - Golden Oval.jpg|Golden Oval during a 2019\u201320 Duleep Trophy match between India Green and India Red ==References== ==External links== * Ground profile \u2013 CricketArchive * Ground profile \u2013 ESPNcricinfo Category:Cricket grounds in Karnataka Category:Sports venues in Bangalore Category:Cricket in Bangalore ",
