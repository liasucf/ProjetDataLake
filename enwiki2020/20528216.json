He grew up in Vienna and exhibited not only at Paris's Salon of Young Artists (1781) but also at London's Royal Academy (1784). He was particularly active in portraiture, producing images of Stanislaus of Poland (1784), the secretary of the Kingdom of Naples (1784) and Marie Antoinette, and was also taken on as the official artist of the La Perouse expedition, on which he disappeared. His skull was thought to have been found off Vanikoro in April 2008, but DNA tests proved inconclusive. ==External links== *Exploration & Discovery: 1770\u20131840 - Lieutenant Blondela and Gaspard Duch\u00e9 de Vancy *Gaspard Duch\u00e9 de Vancy in the RKD Category:18th-century French painters Category:French male painters Category:18th-century French people Category:1756 births Category:1788 deaths Category:Artists from Vienna Category:People lost at sea ",
