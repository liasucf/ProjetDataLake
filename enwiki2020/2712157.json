In September, analysis of the campaign was changed from \"Republican safe\" to \"Republican favored\" due to the emergence of McNerney's campaign. The report noted \"a [GOP] party spokesman says it's because they want to win decisively but others speculate that internal polling has delivered bad news for the incumbent.\" On October 3, 2006, a poll commissioned by Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund was released with McNerney leading Pombo 48 percent to 46 percent.

McNerney said that \"it is important for us to look for ways to save taxpayer money and ensure the federal government is doing its part to preserve our natural resources.\" McNerney argued it would be a good way to collect data so that \"we can use the findings from this study and make sure we are doing everything we can in both federal and private buildings to maximize energy and water efficiency.\" ;Drug legislation In 2007, McNerney voted against legislation that would have prevented the DEA from enforcing prohibition in the twelve states (including California) which allow the use of marijuana for medical purposes. In 2013, McNerney introduced the Methamphetamine Education, Treatment and Hope (METH) Act to modernize and expand programs that combat methamphetamine abuse by expanding treatment for addicts, particularly mothers or pregnant women, and provide grants to provide substance abuse and mental health services in rural areas. ;Other issues McNerney voted in favor of legislation allowing employees to form unions by signing cards authorizing union representation.
