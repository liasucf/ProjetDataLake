    "text": "In petroleum engineering, the Leverett J-function is a dimensionless function of water saturation describing the capillary pressure, :J(S_w) = \\frac{p_c(S_w) \\sqrt{k/\\phi}}{\\gamma \\cos \\theta} where S_w is the water saturation measured as a fraction, p_c is the capillary pressure (in pascal), k is the permeability (measured in m\u00b2), \\phi is the porosity (0-1), \\gamma is the surface tension (in N/m) and \\theta is the contact angle. The function is important in that it is constant for a given saturation within a reservoir, thus relating reservoir properties for neighboring beds. The Leverett J-function is an attempt at extrapolating capillary pressure data for a given rock to rocks that are similar but with differing permeability, porosity and wetting properties. It assumes that the porous rock can be modelled as a bundle of non-connecting capillary tubes, where the factor \\sqrt{k/\\phi} is a characteristic length of the capillaries' radii. This function is also widely used in modeling two-phase flow of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells.J. M. LaManna, J. V. Bothe Jr., F. Y. Zhang, and M. M. Mench, J. Power Sources 271, 180 (2014). A large degree of hydration is needed for good proton conductivity while large liquid water saturation in pores of catalyst layer or diffusion media will impede gas transport in the cathode. J-function in analyzing capillary pressure data is analogous with TEM-function in analyzing relative permeability data. ==See also== * Amott test ==References== ==External links== * http://www.ux.uis.no/~s-skj/ResTek1-v03/Notater/Tamu.Lecture.Notes/Capillary.Pressure/Lecture_16.ppt * http://perminc.com/resources/fundamentals-of-fluid-flow-in-porous- media/chapter-2-the-porous-medium/multi-phase-saturated-rock- properties/averaging-capillary-pressure-data-leverett-j-function/ * Leverett J-Function in Multiphase Saturated Rocks Category:Petroleum engineering ",
