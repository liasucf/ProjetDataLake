In Greece, he founded a private clinic and served in both the First Balkan War (1912\u20131913) and the Second Balkan War (1913) as a doctor. He was discharged in 1916, resuming private medical practice until 1922 when he was again conscripted during the Greco-Turkish War to serve in the Army Hospital of Athens. After the end of the war in 1922, Logothetopoulos became professor of gynaecology at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. Eventually he became Dean of the University. During his tenure at the university, he taught and assisted many young doctors in their studies including future politician Grigoris Lambrakis. When Greece capitulated to Nazi Germany after the \"Battle of Greece\" during World War II, Logothetopoulos, who spoke the German language fluently and was -supposedly- married to the niece of Field Marshal Wilhelm List,Mazower, Mark (1994) [1993]: Inside Hitler's Greece: The Experience of Occupation, 1941-44 (2nd Edition).

When the Wehrmacht left Greece in 1944, Logothetopoulos went with them to Nazi Germany. Eventually he was captured by the United States Army which surrendered him to Greek authorities in 1946. He was tried and convicted of collaborating with the enemy and initially sentenced to life imprisonment, but was released in 1951. ==Death== Logothetopoulos died in Athens on 6 July 1961. ==References== Category:Prime Ministers of Greece Category:Greek collaborators with Nazi Germany Category:Greek fascists Category:Fascist rulers Category:1878 births Category:1961 deaths Category:Greek people of World War II Category:World War II political leaders Category:People convicted of treason against Greece Category:Greek prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:Greek people who died in prison custody Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Greece Category:Prisoners who died in Greek detention Category:National and Kapodistrian University of Athens faculty Category:People from Nafplion Category:1942 in Greece Category:1943 in Greece Category:Greek anti-communists Category:Fascism in Greece Category:20th-century Greek politicians ",
