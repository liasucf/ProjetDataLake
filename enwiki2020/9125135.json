He signed for Stenhousemuir on loan on 24 November 2001, and his league d\u00e9but came the same day, when he played in a 1\u20131 draw at home to Queen of the South. He finally made his United d\u00e9but on the final day of the 2001\u201302 season, as a half-time substitute for regular keeper Paul Gallacher. He joined Forfar Athletic on loan in September 2004. He was supposed to stay until the end of December, but stayed only three days before being recalled by United after regular keeper Tony Bullock suffered a broken collar bone. He finally made his first start for United on 3 October 2004, playing in the 3\u20130 defeat at home to Celtic and remained in the team for the next nine games. Jarvie's most notable appearance for United come in the local derby match against neighbours Dundee, where Jarvie allowed a weak header to slip through his legs in the closing minutes of the match to hand Dundee victory. Jarvie was released by Dundee United in January 2005 and joined Bristol City on non-contract terms. He joined Torquay United the following month, one of seven goalkeepers used by the Gulls that season. He played just once for Torquay, in a 4\u20131 defeat away to Barnsley on 26 February 2005, conceding three goals in the first thirty minutes. Jarvie was released at the end of the season and returned to Scotland, joining Clyde in July 2005, one of eleven players signed within 24 hours by Clyde manager, Graham Roberts. He played eighteen times for Clyde, but in the summer of 2006, he dropped out of the professional game to sign for Inverurie Loco Works. He returned to the senior game after a two-year absence signing for Peterhead in July 2008. ==References== ==External links== *Official website profile * (until Clyde) * (Peterhead) Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Aberdeen Category:Scottish footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Dundee United F.C. players Category:Stenhousemuir F.C. players Category:Forfar Athletic F.C. players Category:Bristol City F.C. players Category:Torquay United F.C. players Category:Clyde F.C. players Category:Inverurie Loco Works F.C. players Category:Peterhead F.C. players Category:Scottish Premier League players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:English Football League players ",
