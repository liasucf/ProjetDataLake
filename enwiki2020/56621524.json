They were ordered as part of a naval construction program directed at France's rivals, Italy and Germany, particularly after Italy made progress in modernizing its own fleet. The plan was also intended to remedy a deficiency in cruisers that had been revealed during training exercises in the 1880s. As such, the Descartes-class cruisers were intended to operate as fleet scouts and in the French colonial empire. The ships were armed with a main battery of four guns supported by ten guns and they had a top speed of . Descartes and Pascal were initially sent to French Indochina in the late 1890s, where they participated in the campaign to suppress the Boxer Uprising in Qing China. Descartes was recalled to France in 1902 to serve in the Atlantic Division while Pascal remained in East Asia, serving until 1904 when she was deactivated due to poor condition. Descartes was sent back to East Asia in 1905 and later to French Madagascar before returning to France in 1907, thereafter serving with the main French fleets in the Mediterranean Sea and English Channel. Pascal was sold to ship breakers in 1911, while Descartes served another stint in the Atlantic Division. She remained there during the first three years of World War I before returning to France in 1917, where she was disarmed and decommissioned. She was struck from the naval register in 1920, but what ultimately became of the ship is unknown. ==Design== ironclad , the threat of which prompted the French naval program of 1890 In the late 1880s, the Italian (Royal Navy) accelerated construction of ships for its fleet and reorganized the most modern ironclad battleships\u2014the and es\u2014into a fast squadron suitable for offensive operations. These developments provoked a strong response in the French press. The Budget Committee in the French Chamber of Deputies began to press for a \"two-power standard\" in 1888, which would see the French fleet enlarged to equal the combined Italian and German fleets, then France's two main rivals on the continent. This initially came to nothing, as the supporters of the doctrine called for a fleet largely based on squadrons of torpedo boats to defend the French coasts rather than an expensive fleet of ironclads. This view had significant support in the Chamber of Deputies. The next year, a war scare with Italy led to further outcry to strengthen the fleet. To compound matters, the visit of a German squadron of four ironclads to Italy confirmed French concerns of a combined Italo-German fleet that would dramatically outnumber their own. Training exercises held in France that year demonstrated that the slower French fleet would be unable to prevent the faster Italian squadron from bombarding the French coast at will, in part because it lacked enough cruisers (and doctrine to use them) to scout for the enemy ships. To correct the weaknesses of the French fleet, on 22 November 1890, the Superior Council authorized a new construction program directed not at simple parity with the Italian and German fleets, but numerical superiority. In addition to twenty- four new battleships, a total of seventy cruisers were to be built for use in home waters and overseas in the French colonial empire. The Descartes class were ordered to as part of the program. ===General characteristics and machinery=== The two Descartes-class cruisers were long between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draft of . They displaced . Like most French warships of the period, the Descartes-class cruisers' hulls had a pronounced ram bow, tumblehome shape, and a short forecastle deck . Below the waterline, the hulls were covered in a layer of wood and copper sheathing to protect them from biofouling on long voyages overseas. The ships had a minimal superstructure, consisting primarily of a small conning tower and a bridge. They were fitted with pole masts with spotting tops for observation and signaling purposes. The ships suffered from stability problems and had to have ballast added after completion. Their crew varied over the course of her career, and consisted of 383\u2013401 officers and enlisted men. The ships' propulsion system consisted of a pair of vertical triple-expansion steam engines driving two screw propellers. Steam was provided by sixteen coal- burning Belleville-type water-tube boilers that were ducted into two funnels. Their machinery was rated to produce for a top speed of . Coal storage amounted to , which gave the ships a cruising radius of at and at 19.5 knots. ===Armament and armor=== A Model 1891 gun in a pivot mount The ships were armed with a main battery of four Mod\u00e8le 1893 45-caliber guns. They were placed in individual sponsons clustered amidships, two guns per broadside. They were supplied with a variety of shells, including solid, cast iron projectiles, and explosive armor-piercing (AP) and semi-armor-piercing (SAP) shells that weighed and , respectively. The guns fired with a muzzle velocity of . The main battery was supported by a secondary battery of ten Mod\u00e8le 1891 guns, which were carried in a variety of mounts. Two guns fitted with gun shields were placed side-by-side on the upper deck, four more were in the upper deck forward in casemates. Another pair of guns were in sponsons further aft, and the remaining pair were in pivot mounts on the upper deck aft. The sides of the ships were recessed to allow the primary and secondary guns to fire directly ahead or astern. The guns fired cast iron and AP shells with a muzzle velocity of . For close-range defense against torpedo boats, they carried eight 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and four 1-pounder guns. These were all in single pivot mounts, distributed along the length of the ships. They were also armed with two torpedo tubes in her hull above the waterline. The torpedoes were the M1892 variant, which carried a warhead and had a range of at a speed of . Armor protection consisted of a curved armor deck that was thick on the flat portion, curving down at the sides, where it increased in thickness to . Above the deck, a cellular layer of watertight compartments was intended to contain flooding below the waterline. A light splinter deck covered the propulsion machinery spaces to protect them from shell fragments that penetrated the main armor deck. The gun shields for the deck-mounted 100 mm guns were thick. The ships had plating on the conning tower. ==Construction== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=\"120\" | Name ! width=\"90\" | Laid down ! width=\"90\" | Launched ! width=\"90\" | Completed ! width=\"90\" | Shipyard |- | | August 1892 | 27 September 1894 | July 1896 | , Saint-Nazaire |- | | December 1893 | 26 September 1895 | 1897 | , Toulon |} ==Service history== Plan and profile drawing of the Descartes class Descartes and Pascal were deployed to French Indochina after entering service in 1897, though Pascal did not leave France until after completing her sea trials by January 1898. Both ships were present during the Boxer Uprising in Qing China; they were among the vessels France contributed to the Eight-Nation Alliance that defeated the Boxers in the early 1900s. Descartes returned to France in 1902, when she joined the Atlantic Division, though Pascal remained in East Asia. Pascals condition deteriorated after several years abroad, where the French lacked sufficient shipyard facilities, and by 1904, her engines could no longer reach her design speed. She saw little further use thereafter, in part because the French Navy had settled on building a fleet of armored cruisers to fulfill the roles that the Descartes class had been intended to fill. She was struck from the naval register in 1911 and later broken up. In the meantime, Descartes was sent on a second deployment to East Asia in 1905. She had been transferred to French Madagascar by 1907, and later that year, she returned France to join the Mediterranean Squadron. Descartes was then transferred to the Northern Squadron. By 1914, the ship was operating with the Atlantic Division; she was patrolling in Central American waters and was slated to return to France when World War I started in July. She instead remained in the region and joined the French and British vessels searching for the German light cruiser that was attacking merchant shipping in the area, though they failed to locate her. Descartes spent the next three years patrolling the West Indies, seeing no action. After returning home in 1917, she was decommissioned and disarmed, her guns being used as field artillery and to arm patrol vessels. She was struck from the naval register in 1920, but her ultimate fate is unknown. ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Cruiser classes Category:Ships built in France Category:World War I cruisers of France Category:1890s ships ",
