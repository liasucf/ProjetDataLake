    "text": "How Can We Hang On to a Dream? is a song composed and recorded by Tim Hardin. Many covers of the song have been recorded by prominent artists of the age, including a 1969 psychedelic rock recording by the short-lived band Gandalf. A cover version with a choral arrangement by Duncan Browne was recorded by The Nice, as \"Hang On to a Dream\", on their third album, Nice, and Nazareth on Snakes 'N' Ladders (1989). A closer cover version was performed by Fleetwood Mac on a 1969 BBC recording, released on Live at the BBC in 2001. Emerson, Lake & Palmer covered it on The Return of the Manticore. Johnny Hallyday released a French version in 1969, as \"Je m'accroche \u00e0 mon r\u00eave\", with French lyrics by Georges Aber. It was once again covered in 2019 by prominent Irish rap star Rodney Paz for a special edition of The Late Late Toy Show. The Lemonheads released a much better cover of the track as a bonus addition to online editions of their 2009 covers album Varshons. Life of Riley: The Lightning Seeds Collection includes a cover version of the song. Fran\u00e7oise Hardy recorded the song for her album En Anglais under the title \"Hang On to a Dream\". The Moody Blues with Denny Laine recorded two complete versions of the song (on April 5, 1969, and July 5, 1969). Both versions remained unissued until the late 2014 UK Esoteric 2-CD boxset of The Magnificent Moodies. Kathryn Williams recorded a cover version on her album Relations. Hardin's version appeared on the soundtrack to the 1997 film Fever Pitch; the English Romo band Orlando contributed a cover version to the Fever Pitch E.P. which was released to accompany the soundtrack.
