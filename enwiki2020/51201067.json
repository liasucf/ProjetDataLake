When construction of the building was rushed for a film festival, the ceiling scaffolding collapsed, killing several workmen. Rather than halt construction to rescue survivors and retrieve the bodies of the dead workmen, First Lady Imelda Marcos, the main financier of the project, was believed to have ordered cement to be poured into the orchestra, entombing the fallen workmen, some of whom were even buried alive. Various ghostly activities have been reported, including mysterious sounds, voices and poltergeist activity. In the late 1990s, a group called the Spirit Questors began to make visits to the film center, in an attempt to contact and appease the souls of the workmen who were killed in the building.
