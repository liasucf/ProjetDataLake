    "text": "Statue of Charles Fran\u00e7ois Lhomond in Chaulnes Charles Fran\u00e7ois Lhomond (; 1727 \u2013 December 31, 1794) was a French priest, grammarian, and educator who was a native of Chaulnes, Somme. He attended classes at the Coll\u00e8ge d'Inville in Paris, where he subsequently became dean of the school. Later on, he spent twenty years as an educator at the Coll\u00e8ge du Cardinal-Lemoine in the Latin Quarter of Paris, and afterwards was professor emeritus at the University of Paris. Lhomond made contributions in the field of education, being the author of several works on grammar, Roman history and religious history. His textbook from 1779, De viris illustribus urbis Romae a Romulo ad Augustum, was still used in the 20th century by French students learning Roman history and Latin. Other works by Lhomond include: * \u00c9l\u00e9mens de la grammaire fran\u00e7oise (Basics of French Grammar, 1771) * \u00c9l\u00e9mens de la grammaire latine (Basics of Latin Grammar, 1779) * Epitome histori\u00e6 sacr\u00e6 (Summary of Sacred History, 1784) * Histoire abr\u00e9g\u00e9e de l'\u00c9glise (Abridged History of the Church) * Histoire abr\u00e9g\u00e9e de la religion avant la venue de J\u00e9sus-Christ (Abridged History of Religion Prior to the Arrival of Jesus Christ) In 1792 he was jailed for refusing to swear allegiance to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, but was released shortly afterwards through intervention by Jean-Lambert Tallien (1767\u20131820), a former student of his at Coll\u00e8ge du Cardinal-Lemoine. A statue of Lhomond by French sculptor Eug\u00e8ne-Louis Lequesne stands in his home town of Chaulnes. == References == * Epitome Historiae Sacr\u00e6 (translated biography) Category:1727 births Category:1794 deaths Category:18th-century Latin-language writers Category:18th-century male writers Category:French educators Category:Grammarians from France Category:People from Somme (department) ",
