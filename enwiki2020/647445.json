KTCA (channel 2) began broadcasting as the first non-commercial Public television station in the state on September 16, 1957, from a shabby, WWII wooden barracks-type structure on the University of Minnesota Agricultural Campus. The studios and offices were moved in the 1960s to what was known as the Minnesota Statehood Centennial Memorial Building for Education Television, at 1640 Como Avenue in Saint Paul. (Incidentally, that building housed another Twin Cities commercial television station, WUCW, channel 23, from 1989 to 2018.) KTCA's first program was Exploring Science. A second station, KTCI (channel 17), was launched on May 4, 1965. Channel 17 was originally assigned to the Tedesco Brothers in the early 1950s to be a commercial station, WCOW-TV, affiliated with the DuMont Television Network, but that station never made it to air. In 1967, KTCA became the first educational television station in the United States to broadcast in color. In 1977 it changed its corporate name to Twin Cities Public Television. On September 15, 2000, the stations began their first digital television broadcasts, 10 years after moving to 172 4th Street East in downtown Saint Paul. In 2000, KTCA and KTCI were rebranded tpt2 and tpt17, paving the way for the larger family of digital broadcast services to come. In 2003, TPT became the first broadcaster in Minnesota to launch a channel, tptHD, fully devoted to high-definition programming, and in 2005 the organization launched a full-time digital channel, tptMN, devoted entirely to local and regional programs. In December 2005, the organization began distributing many of its productions online, making programs available through iTunes, Google Video, and Yahoo! Podcasts among others. Its website features streaming video as well as video podcasts. In 2007, TPT began offering Video- On-Demand (VOD) thorough local cable providers. KTCA's Nielsen ratings are among the highest of any PBS station in the country. Logo used from 2000 until September 30, 2015. During the summer of 2015, a new name and logo, \"Twin Cities PBS\", was introduced, before debuting on air on September 30, 2015. The rebrand included an updated version of the tpt logo that had been used since 2000, by Minnesota design agency Capsule. ==Productions== TPT is one of the few public television organizations that regularly produces programs for the national PBS schedule.

It features programming related to Minnesota and Wisconsin, including ethnic and public-affairs programming. In 2003, TPT began setting aside time on KTCI for the \"Minnesota Channel\", an evening dedicated to local and regional related programming, which expanded to a full-time digital subchannel on September 16, 2005. The Minnesota Channel was expanded region-wide in Minnesota and North Dakota in February 2008. ==Digital television== ===Digital channels=== The stations' digital signals are multiplexed: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

TPT's stations shut down their analog signals at 9 a.m. on June 12, 2009, the date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts by federal mandate. The station's digital channel allocations post-transition are as follows: * KTCA- TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 2; the station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 34. Through PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 2.1. * KTCI-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 17; the station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 16. Through PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as 2.3 The then-new channel lineup was originally meant to coincide with the DTV transition. When the transition's mandatory cutoff was delayed, TPT announced the new lineup would still go forward and it would continue its analog service until the new cutoff. Until then, KTCA-TV simulcasted tpt 2 and KTCI-TV simulcasted tptLife on their analog signals. ==Transmission technical data== KTCA and KTCI are broadcast from the KMSP Tower in Shoreview, Minnesota. In addition, four digital translators in southern Minnesota relay KTCA and one relays KTCI. *K16MA-D 16 Frost *K35DK-D 35 Granite Falls *K22MY-D 22 Jackson *K26CS-D 26 St. James *K29IE-D 29 St. James (Relays KTCI) ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== *Twin Cities Public Television *Minnesota Channel *RabbitEars.info website \u2013 KTCA *RabbitEars.info website \u2013 KTCI * ** ** ** * ** * * Category:PBS member networks Category:Television stations in Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul Category:Television channels and stations established in 1957 Category:1957 establishments in Minnesota ",
