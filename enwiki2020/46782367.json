Eleanor Josephine Macdonald (4 March 1906 \u2013 26 July 2007) was a pioneer American cancer epidemiologist and cancer researcher influenced and mentored by Edwin Bidwell Wilson and Shields Warren. One of the earliest proponents of the idea that cancer was a preventable disease. She established the first cancer registry in the United States in Connecticut. ==Life and times== Eleanor Josephine Macdonald the daughter of Angus Alexander and Catherine Macdonald was born in the Boston suburb of West Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1906. She died in Houston, Texas, in 2007. Angus Alexander, whose family had come from Scotland, was an engineer at A.T. & T. and Catharine Boland Macdonald, whose family were of Anglo-Irish descent was a concert pianist. She attended Radcliffe College and graduated in 1928 with A.B. degrees in music, history of literature, and English. For 4 years following graduation, she performed as a professional cellist.Annual Reports of the President and Treasurer. (1929). Radcliffe College. Cambridge, MA.Ruiz, Rosanna. (28 July 2007). Eleanor J. Macdonald. Houston Chronicle. ==Epidemiology career== Robert B. Greenough, M.D., chairman of the Cancer Committee in Massachusetts, and friend of the family asked Macdonald for assistance in writing a research paper on cystic mastitis.Greenough, Robert B. (1905). On the Nature of the Cell Inclusions of Cancer. The Journal of medical research. 13(2): 137.Greenough, Robert B. (1925). \"Varying Degrees of Malignancy in Cancer of the Breast.\" The Journal of Cancer Research 9(4): 453-463. This led her to become an epidemiologist. Macdonald studied the fundamentals of epidemiology and statistics at Harvard University School of Public Health. At Harvard she worked with Edwin Bidwell Wilson who tutored her in statistical approaches and the Ronald Fisher methods. Macdonald was then appointed as the Epidemiologist in Boston's State Cancer Program at the Division of Adult Hygiene for director Dr. Herbert L.

Johns Hopkins University Press. Baltimore, MD. She was an early adopter of the new computer technology that became available to researchers. Since about 1930 Macdonald worked with Remington Rand punch cards.Macdonald, Eleanor J. (February 1936). \"Fundamentals of Epidemiology.\" The Radcliffe Quarterly.

From 1940-1948 she worked for the Connecticut State Department of Health as statistician. Then to Memorial Hospital in New York. Macdonald was asked by Dr. Thomas Parran, Jr., U.S. Surgeon General to set up a national cancer registry as she had done in Connecticut. In 1948 her work in Connecticut led to publishing the seminal work \"The Incidence and Survival in Cancer\".Macdonald, E. J. (1948). The present incidence and survival picture in cancer and the promise of improved prognosis. Bulletin of American College of Surgeons. After this she went on to M.D. Anderson Hospital in Houston, Texas.Ruiz, Rosanna. (28 July 2007). Eleanor J. Macdonald. Houston Chronicle. Her work in New England caught the attention of Dr. R. Lee Clark who recruited her to be the head of the newly created Department of Epidemiology at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute.Hill, C. Stratton.

Historical Resources Center, Research Medical Library, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Houston, TX. In 1948 she went to Houston to become Professor of Epidemiology at MD Anderson. During her tenure she developed a 200-code (referred to as the anticipatory code) method for transcribing patient charts that provided statistical information to M. D. Anderson's physicians and researchers.Clark Jr, R., & Macdonald, E. J. (1949). The University of Texas, MD Anderson Hospital for Cancer Research. Medical woman's journal, 56(8): 34-37.Guide to the R.
