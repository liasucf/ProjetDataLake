The European Political Strategy Centre is a department of the European Commission, reporting directly to the President of the European Commission and under his authority. The Centre is composed of a professional staff of advisers, policy analysts and support staff with appropriate experience and attainments, in order to provide professional and well-informed advice to the President and the European Commissioners and to formulate recommendations on issues regarding the policy of the European Union. The Centre is headed by a Director General (Ann Mettler, as of June 2016) designated by the President. The Director General is responsible for establishing the positions taken by the European Political Strategy Centre. ==History== ===Forward Studies Unit of the European Commission=== The origins of what is today known as EPSC go back to 1989, when the Forward Studies Unit was established by the European Commission as a small 'think tank' staffed with EU officials reporting directly to President Jacques Delors. The Unit's primary task was to monitor and evaluate European integration by studying long-term prospects and structural tendencies, basing itself particularly on a network of external contacts with research institutes specialised in long-term forecasting and planning. ====Members of the Forward Studies Unit of the European Commission==== *Marc Luyckx Ghisi *Guy Spier *Maria Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues ===Group of Policy Advisers (GOPA)=== In May 2000, Romano Prodi changed the Forward Studies Unit into the Group of Policy Advisers (GOPA) and entrusted it with four specific domains: economics, social affairs, foreign affairs, and dialogue with religions. ===Bureau of European Policy Advisers (BEPA)=== With the arrival of Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso as President of the European Commission in 2004, GOPA was restructured and rebranded as the Bureau of European Policy Advisers (BEPA). ===European Political Strategy Centre (EPSC)=== With the arrival of Jean-Claude Juncker as President of the European Commission in 2014, BEPA was restructured and rebranded as European Political Strategy Centre (EPSC). ==See also== *Codecision procedure *Committee of Permanent Representatives (Coreper) *European Research Advisory Board (EURAB) ==External links== *European Political Strategy Centre Category:European Commission ",
