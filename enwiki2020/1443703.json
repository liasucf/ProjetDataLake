Founded by Ermenegildo Zegna in 1910, in Trivero, Biella Province of the Piedmont Region of Northern Italy, Ermenegildo Zegna remains one of the most renowned businesses in Italy. ==History== === Foundation and early years === Prior to the founding of the company, founder Ermenegildo Zegna's father Angelo \u2013 a former watchmaker \u2013 owned a wool mill and looms in the Alps of Piedmont, Italy. Ermenegildo, together with his brothers Edoardo and Mario, founded the company in 1910 in Trivero in the Biellese Alps when he was only 18, utilizing his father's looms and assets. In 1915 the company was renamed Fratelli Zegna di Angelo.Ermenegildo Zegna (1892\u20131966) === Growth === Zegna's vision was to create high-quality fabrics, so he began to source wool directly from several countries around the world, such as Mongolia, Australia, South Africa; he also bought modern machinery from England. During the Interwar period, Zegna's business started to flourish. In the late 1920s, the Lanificio (wool mill) employed more than 700 workers, growing to more than 1,000 in the late 1930s. In 1938 the company began to export fabrics in the US. through its subsidiary Zegna Woollens Corporation established in New York City. In 1942, Ermenegildo's sons Aldo (born in 1920) and Angelo (born in 1924) entered the company, which was renamed Ermenegildo Zegna and Sons. In the mid-1950s, the company employed 1,400 workers. === Second generation === Ermenegildo Zegna's sons, Aldo and Angelo, took over the company in the mid-1960s. Under their guide, the label both expanded its business to ready-made suits and established new plants and distribution network abroad. In 1968, the first factory producing sleeve-units and trousers was opened in Novara, followed by openings in Spain, Greece, and Switzerland. Sales and marketing departments were also established in France, Germany, the U.K., and the U.S. alt= In 1972, Zegna launched its made-to- measure service called Su Misura. Zegna's attention to wool quality continued through 1960s and 1970s, as the company established the Wool Awards in Australia (1963) and the Mohair Trophy in South Africa (1970). The international development strategy run by the Zegna brothers brought to the openings of the first owned boutique in Paris in 1980, followed by Milan in 1985. In 1991 Zegna became the first luxury label to open a store in China. === Third generation === During the 1990s, the third generation of the Zegna family entered the business.
