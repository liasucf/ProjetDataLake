The Conservatives continued to hold most of the seats in 2004 (with one exception in the northwestern corner of the province). While the NDP managed to take another seat in 2006, staunch divisions on social issues made it difficult for the NDP to make further gains.

For decades, the only close races in this region have been between the Conservatives and NDP. In the 2015 election, regional NDP strength allowed them to pick up a third seat, and in one of the biggest surprises of the election, the Liberals picked up their first seat in the BC Interior since 1974 in the region's most urban riding, Kelowna\u2014Lake Country.Kevin Parnell, Lake Country expected to meet with new MP Stephen Fuhr, The Kelowna Capital News, October 26, 2015. ==2015 - 42nd General Election== ==2011 - 41st General Election== ==2008 - 40th General Election== ==2006 - 39th General Election== ==2004 - 38th General Election== {| |- |Key map | #Cariboo-Prince George #Kamloops-Thompson-Cariboo #Kelowna- Lake Country #Kootenay-Columbia #Okanagan-Coquihalla #Okanagan-Shuswap #Prince George-Peace River #Skeena-Bulkley Valley #British Columbia Southern Interior |- |Conservative Party of Canada |Green Party of Canada |- |Liberal Party of Canada |New Democratic Party |} ==2000 - 37th General Election== ==Notes== ==References== Category:Canadian federal election results in British Columbia ",
