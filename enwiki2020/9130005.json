Liverpool matches were generally close affairs, two of their five ties went to a replay. Apart from a 5\u20131 victory in their third round replay against West Ham United, their biggest margin of victory was by two goals. Watched by a crowd of 72,778, including King George V, who became the first reigning monarch to attend a FA Cup Final and to present the trophy to the winners, the first half was goalless.
