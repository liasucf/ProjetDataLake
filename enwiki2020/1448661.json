    "text": "Gargoyle Games was a British software company founded in 1983 by Roy Carter and Greg Follis in order to publish their first game, Ad Astra. They generally specialized in games for the ZX Spectrum even though the company was originally named with the intention of publishing games for Dragon computers. They also released games on their own label Faster Than Light, as well as on the Elite label. Two of Gargoyle's releases, Marsport and Heavy on the Magick were intended to be the first in a series of games but the planned sequels were never released. Marsport is often considered an unofficial companion to Tir Na Nog and Dun Darach due to its similar gameplay. Tir Na N\u00f3g and Dun Darach are part of the same series, with Dun Darach being a prequel released the following year. == Notable Games == *Ad Astra (1984) *Tir Na Nog (1984) *Dun Darach (1985) *Marsport (1985) *Heavy on the Magick (1986) *Sweevo's World (1986) *Scooby Doo in the Castle Mystery (1986) *Light Force (FTL/Gargoyle 1986) *Shockway Rider (FTL/Gargoyle 1987) *Hydrofool (FTL/Gargoyle 1987) == External links == * Article about Gargoyle Games from the January 1986 issue of CRASH magazine. * Interview with Gargoyle Games from the November 1985 issue of Sinclair User. *Information about Gargoyle Games at Planet Sinclair. * Further info on Gargoyle Games Category:Video game companies of the United Kingdom Category:ZX Spectrum Category:Companies established in 1983 ",
