    "text": "Austin Stories is an American sitcom that aired on MTV from September 10, 1997, until January 7 1998. It first aired on MTV on September 10, 1997, and aired Wednesday nights at 10:30 pm. The show aired twelve episodes filmed on location in Austin, Texas. An MTV search brought executives James Jones and Lisa Berger to Austin in 1994. Jones had previous produced The Ben Stiller Show and Berger was vice-president and director of development at the network. MTV scouts were drawn to the city's emerging comedy scene and noticed Laura House, Howard Kremer and Brad \"Chip\" Pope. They were all discovered at a showcase for MTV at the Laff Stop for professional comics. All three had to pull strings to get on the showcase as none of them had been paid for their comedy. House was a junior high journalism teacher when she was cast on the show. Both she and Brad \"Chip\" Pope were University of Texas graduates. Originally, the show was only guaranteed 13 episodes on the channel. In March 1997, MTV flew House, Kremer and Pope to Los Angeles to write two scripts in three days. Austin Stories was green-lighted on March 20, 1997 and they often spent 16-hour days working on the show with taping wrapping in November. Their contract expired on May 8, 1998 and MTV extended it for three more weeks before permanently canceling the show on June 1, 1998. ==Cast== *Laura House *Howard Kremer *Brad \"Chip\" Pope *Heather Kafka ==Episodes== ==Response== USA Today gave the show three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it, \"one of the season's coolest, funniest and most genuinely offbeat treats.\" In her review for The New York Times, Caryn James wrote, \"With its meandering style, and its sense of wry comic absurdities rather than yuck-it-up one-liners, the series owes almost everything to Richard Linklater's Slacker (including their shared Austin setting). What it hasn't got from that film it owes to Jim Jarmusch's work, especially Stranger Than Paradise. But instead of seeming derivative, Austin Stories comes across as a first-rate sequel, proof that this laid-back sensibility can thrive on television as well as in films.\" ==See also== *Portlandia, a similar series set in Portland, Oregon ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1990s American sitcoms Category:1997 American television series debuts Category:1998 American television series endings Category:English-language television shows Category:Mass media in Austin, Texas Category:MTV original programming Category:Television shows filmed in Texas Category:Television shows set in Austin, Texas ",
