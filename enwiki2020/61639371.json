    "text": "__NOTOC__ In basketball, a triple-double is defined as a performance in which one player accumulates a double-digit total in three of five positive statistical categories\u2014points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocked shots\u2014in a game. The most common way for a player to achieve a triple-double is with points, rebounds, and assists, though on occasion players may record 10 or more steals or blocked shots in a game. Each player on this list has accomplished this feat at least five times in a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's or women's game. Individual scoring and rebounding totals have been recognized as official NCAA statistics throughout what it calls the \"modern era\" of men's basketball, which it considers to have started with the 1937\u201338 season, the first without the center jump after each made basket. Similarly, the NCAA has recognized the same statistics in women's basketball since it began sponsoring competition in that sport in the 1981\u201382 season. However, official recognition of the other possible components of the triple-double did not come until later. In men's basketball, the NCAA first kept individual assist totals in the 1950\u201351 season, but discontinued the practice after the 1951\u201352 season, not resuming until 1983\u201384. Blocked shots and steals became official men's statistics in 1985\u201386. In women's basketball, assists became an official Division I statistic in 1985\u201386, with blocks and steals following in 1987\u201388. Both the men's and women's lists include only triple-doubles that are officially recognized by the NCAA. Through the 2019\u201320 season, the career record for triple-doubles in Division I men's basketball is held by BYU's Kyle Collinsworth with 12. On the women's Division I side, Sabrina Ionescu of Oregon holds the record with 26. No school has had more than one player record five or more triple-doubles in either the men's or women's game. However, Saint Mary's has featured one men's and one women's player who accomplished this feat: Brian Shaw (who split his college career between Saint Mary's and UC Santa Barbara), and Louella Tomlinson (who played her entire college career at Saint Mary's). ==Key== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |Pos.||G||F||C |- |Position||Guard||Forward||Center |- |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |style=\"background-color:#ffff99; width:6em\"|* |Elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame |- |Player (X) |Denotes the number of times a player from that school appears on a specific list |- |} ==Men== Shaquille O'Neal is the only member of the Naismith Hall of Fame to have recorded as many as 5 triple-doubles in his college career. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
