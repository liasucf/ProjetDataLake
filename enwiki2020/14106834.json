Forensic analyst Michael Dickson also argued that because the majority of files were kept in the c:\\windows\\options folder, it showed a clear intent to \"hide\" his interest.https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/23/siddique_trial_sentencing/ The trial concluded with nine hours of deliberation by the jury of nine women and six men, resulting in a Guilty verdict on September 27, 2007.Man convicted of terror offences After the conviction, Kohlmann said that Siddique \"apparently lacked in the skills, sophistication, lengthy credentials, and cold-blooded professionalism\" associated with actual terrorists and described him as \"undoubtedly naive\".CounterTerrorism Blog After the trial ended, the prosecution alleged that it had been his intention to disappear once in Pakistan to join a Toronto-based group arrested on allegations of wanting to bomb Canadian targets, though his counsel pointed out that no evidence was ever produced to support the allegation, and referred to it as a \"smear\". Following the trial, Lord Carloway announced he intended to seek contempt of court charges against Siddique's solicitor Aamer Anwar for making \"disparaging remarks\" about the outcome of the trial, referring to an \"atmosphere of hostility\".Contempt issue after terror case, 23 October 2007 Siddique's leading counsel was Donald Findlay.Terror trial told procedures were not followed, August 28, 2007. ==Appeal== On the 29th of January, 2010, one of the charges against Siddique was overturned on appeal.Siddique terror conviction quashed on appeal, 29 January 2010 The appeal judge, Lord Osborne, stated that some directions given to the jury by the trial judge, Lord Carloway, were a \"material misdirection\" and amounted to a \"miscarriage of justice\". The Crown Office issued a statement on 9 February 2010 indicating that it had decided not to seek a retrial of Mohammed Atif Siddique on terrorism charges following the Criminal Appeal Court's decision two weeks ago to quash a conviction under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000, on the basis that the trial judge misdirected the jury as to the relevant law. The statement continues as follows: \u201cThe law in relation to section 57 of Terrorism Act 2000 has, since the trial judge charged the jury, further developed through a number of decisions in the English courts. \u201cAfter careful consideration of the Appeal Court\u2019s judgment, the Crown has decided not to seek authority for a retrial. The fact that Mr Siddique has already served the majority of his sentence for charge 1, and has de facto served his sentence in full for the other terrorist offences, of which he remains convicted, means that a retrial would have little practical effect. Accordingly, the Crown has concluded that a retrial would not be in the public interest. \"Mohammed Atif Siddique remains convicted of the other charges on the indictment which were: * section 54 of the Terrorism Act 2000: setting up websites providing links to documents providing instructions on how to operate weaponry and make explosives * section 2 of the Terrorism Act 2006: circulating terrorist publications by means of websites to encourage, induce or assist the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism) * breach of the peace: showing images of suicide bombers, murders and beheadings to fellow students, threatening to be a suicide bomber and to carry out terrorism in Glasgow or elsewhere.\" ==References== Category:Scottish people of Pakistani descent Category:People convicted on terrorism charges Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:People from Clackmannanshire Category:Overturned convictions in Scotland ",
