Born in West Bromwich, he was elected at the 1918 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Rochdale constituency in Lancashire, but was defeated at the 1922 general election. He was returned to the House of Commons at the 1929 general election for the High Peak constituency in Derbyshire, and held the seat until his death in Littleborough 1939, aged 79. In 1921 Law donated the trophy for a rugby league match between Oldham and Rochdale. It was originally known as the Infirmaries Cup and later renamed as the Law Cup. Sir Alfred was the owner of the poet Robert Burns's First Commonplace Book 1783-1785 manuscript volume that he had inherited from William Law of Honresfield, Lancashire, his uncle. The poet's second commonplace book, the Edinburgh Journal is held by the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum in Alloway, South Ayrshire. == References == * * == External links == * Category:1860 births Category:1939 deaths Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for constituencies in Derbyshire Category:UK MPs 1918\u20131922 Category:UK MPs 1929\u20131931 Category:UK MPs 1931\u20131935 Category:UK MPs 1935\u20131945 Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Rochdale Category:High Peak, Derbyshire ",
