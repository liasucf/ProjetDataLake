Ahead of 2014 European Parliament election, Salvini started to cooperate with Marine Le Pen, leader of the French National Front, and Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom. All this was criticised by LN founder Umberto Bossi, who re-called his left-wing roots, and Mayor of Verona Flavio Tosi, who represented the party's centrist wing and defended the Euro. In March 2015, after a long struggle with Luca Zaia and Salvini, Tosi was ejected from the party.

Giovanni Fava, who is anti-prohibition of drugs, pro-civil unions for same-sex couples, pro-United States, pro-NATO, and anti-National Front (\"[it] is one of the most centralist and conservative blocs in Europe, what has it to do with us?\"), recalled an old LN activist saying \"let's hurry up in making Padania, that I want to return voting the left\" and added \"this was the League and it has to be like this anew\".Fava: \u201cSfido Salvini perch\u00e9 la Lega non perda le sue radici.
