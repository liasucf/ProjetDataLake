Dictionary of Paul and His Letters. InterVarsity Press. p. 838. with the help of an amanuensis (secretary), Tertius, who added his own greeting in Romans 16:22. In this chapter, Paul asks a series of rhetorical questions in order to develop his theological message,There are 15 rhetorical questions according to the New International Version translation and quotes extensively from the Hebrew Bible.There are 9 biblical references: see Cross references Theologian Albert Barnes suggests that \"the design of the first part of this chapter is to answer some of the objections which might be offered by a Jew to the statements in the previous chapter\".Barnes' Notes on Romans 3, accessed 7 September 2016 ==Text== The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 31 verses. ===Textual witnesses=== Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Papyrus 40 (~AD 250; extant verses 21\u201331) *Codex Vaticanus (325\u2013350) *Codex Sinaiticus (330\u2013360) *Codex Alexandrinus (400\u2013440) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; extant verses 22\u201331) ===Old Testament references=== * = Psalm * = Psalm ; Psalm ; * = Psalm ; Psalm * = Psalm * = Isaiah * = Psalm * = Psalm b ==The Oracles of God== The chief advantage, or benefit, or responsibility, or superiority Interlinear Bible of the Jewish people is their possession of the Hebrew Bible (, ta logia tou theou, \"the very words of God\" in verse 2 New International Version). Traditional translations (the Geneva Bible, King James Version, American Standard Version and Revised Standard Version) refer to the \"oracles of God\". The Jewish \"advantage\" (, to perissov) is really an act of entrustment (Romans 3:2). === Verse 2 === :Much in every way! First of all, the Jews have been entrusted with the very words of God. NIV Nonconformist theologian Matthew Poole stated that \"to the Jews were credited, or given in custody, the Holy Scriptures\". Stephen, whose martyrdom Paul had witnessed before his conversion, called the scriptures the \"living oracles\" (, logia zonta). ==Slanderous criticisms== In verse 8, Paul refers to slanderous accusations made by \"some people\" Romans 3:8 in International Standard Version that believers say \u201cLet\u2019s do evil that good may result\u201d. Bishop Charles Ellicott suggests that these accusers might have been the Jews or \"the Judaizing party\";Ellicott's Commentary for Modern Readers on Romans 3, accessed 17 September 2016 Barnes says it is \"doubtless\" that they were Jews;Barnes' Notes on Romans 3, accessed 7 September 2016 the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges argues that they were Paul's \"inveterate adversaries in the Church\".Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Romans 3, accessed 17 September 2016 ==The Revelation of God's Righteousness (3:21\u201326)== This section (extending to verse 31) revisits 'the grand theme', \"the righteousness of God\", which is introduced in the Thanksgiving part of chapter 1.

Hafemann. Louisville, Ky: Westminster/John Knox. p. 57; apud Hill 2007, p. 1092 stating that 'the divine character\u2014faithful, gracious, forgiving, and merciful\u2014has been revealed in Jesus Christ, specifically in his death as \"a sacrifice for sin effective through faith\". With that actions, 'altogether apart from human initiative', God has fulfilled 'what God always intended to do' ('attested by the law and the prophets') 'and so is proved righteous'. ===Verse 23=== :For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; KJV *\"Come short\" (RSV, NKJV: \"fall short): translated from , 'Greek Text Analysis: Romans 3:23.
