She is upset to see that her toddler daughter, Rae, is afraid of her due to her severe facial scarring. Jade is supported by her mother and her friends but feels awkward returning to her regular clubbing activities. Disappointed to learn that her healing is as good as it will ever be Jade contacts a surgeon in Morocco to try to undergo facial reconstruction surgery. As her mother will not loan her the money for the surgery she enlists in a dead-end job at a call centre where she befriends Flavia, another single mother. She reveals to Flavia that she was burned by Rae's father who poured acid on her when they broke up. Jade undergoes a series of setbacks when she learns her mother has been allowing Rae to interact with her paternal grandmother. Jade's mother temporarily kicks Jade out of the house and a video of Jade masturbating is leaked at work. Desperate for the facial reconstruction surgery she steals the necessary money from her mother and leaves for Morocco with her best friend Shami, only to be disappointed when Shami brings along her boyfriend, Naz, with whom Jade had previously had a flirtation. While there Naz and Jade nearly have sex but are stopped by the arrival of Shami. Jade learns that the plastic surgery she paid for is a scam. Later Naz confesses he has real feelings for her but Jade rebuffs him out of respect for Shami. Returning home Jade wins an employee of the month award at work and reconciles with her mother. == Cast == * Vicky Knight as Jade * Eliza Brady-Girard as Rae * Rebecca Stone as Shami * Dana Marineci as Flavia == Reception == === Critical response === On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 29 reviews, and an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"As powerfully acted as it is sensitively told, Dirty God offers a timely story delivered with empathy and deeply affecting grace.\" Cath Clarke of The Guardian wrote, \"Dirty God is Dutch director Polak\u2019s English-language debut, and it\u2019s an authentic portrait of London. Polak shoots with in-the- moment energy: in hospital wards, at a grime club, in a drab call centre where Jade gets a job to pay for surgery.\"Nikki Baughan of Sight & Sound wrote, \"Positively vibrating with barely suppressed pain, rage and injustice, Sacha Polak\u2019s Dirty God is both a sharply observed character study and a damning indictment of our skin-deep Instagram culture.\"Hanna Flint of the Time Out wrote, \"Polak follows in the footsteps of directors Andrea Arnold (\u2018Fish Tank\u2019) and Benh Zeitlin (\u2018Beasts of the Southern Wild\u2019) by drawing out a brilliantly nuanced performance from first-time-actor Knight, a burn victim herself.\"Jay Weissberg of the Variety wrote, \"Much attention will deservedly be paid to Knight\u2019s impressively nuanced performance \u2013 it\u2019s one thing to cast an amateur who\u2019s been through similar experiences, and quite another to get that person to inhabit a fictional character. Vulnerable, flinty, and unashamedly sexual, Knight\u2019s Jade may not be an especially likable person, but she\u2019s vibrantly real, and the newcomer brings a forceful physicality and, in her scenes with Robinson, a palpable sensuality.\"Sophie Monks Kaufman of the Empire wrote, \"An intimate portrait of a restless young woman seeking mind, body and soul comfort. Newcomer Vicky Knight is magnetic and there are flashes of kinetic brilliance despite sketchy stretches.\" Eric D. Snider of the CrookedMarquee criticised the film for having a thin plot and being hard to watch. And he further added \"It\u2019s not quite gratuitous misery porn \u2014 it\u2019s ultimately more hopeful than that \u2014 but it\u2019s adjacent to it. Director Sacha Polak, co-writing with Susie Farrell, focuses on Jade\u2019s valiant and not-so- valiant efforts to rebuild her life and not let her injuries destroy her, but it\u2019s hard not to get bogged down in the sadness of every damn detail.\", and \"Knight\u2019s naturalistic performance notwithstanding, it\u2019s a hard movie to watch, and the rewards aren\u2019t sufficient. The plot is thin, and these aren\u2019t the sort of characters you want to just hang out with.\" == Awards == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Award !Year !Category !Result !Ref |- | rowspan=\"4\" |British Independent Film Awards | rowspan=\"4\" |2019 |Best Actress | | rowspan=\"4\" | |- |Best Supporting Actor | |- |Most Promising Newcomer | |- |Best Make Up & Hair Design | |} == References == == External links == * Category:2019 films Category:2019 drama films Category:British films Category:British drama films Category:Burn survivors in fiction Category:Films directed by Sacha Polak ",
