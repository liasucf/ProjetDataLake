    "text": "Carver Heights High School was a segregated public school for black students in Leesburg, Florida. It briefly served as the site of segregated Johnson Junior College as well. It was closed when the schools were integrated. ==History== In 1876, a school for black children began meeting in what is now St. Stephen AME church in Leesburg. After several moves, the school became known as Lake County Training School. The first high school class graduated in 1933. Along with Lake County Training School, Carver Heights served as the high school for African-American children in segregated Lake County, Florida. Lake County Training School was founded in 1922 with fewer than 100 students, and five faculty members. In 1954 Carver Heights was opened, and both schools continued to serve the community until 1968, when actions by the Federal courts forced white community leaders to allow black students to enter the same schools as white students. In 1962, Johnson Junior College was created simultaneously with what is now Lake-Sumter Community College, which was created for white students and initially located at Leesburg High School. Johnson was designated for black students, who met in the buildings of Carver Heights.title=History of Lake-Sumter College |url=https://www.lssc.edu/about- us/history-of-lake-sumter-state-college/ All the black high school students were sent to Leesburg High School, and Carver Heights was repurposed as a middle school. When the black schools were merged, much of the black faculty was retained, often with reduced responsibilities. ==Athletics== The school participated as a member of the Florida Interscholastic Athletic Association. The team nickname was the Trojans. ==Notable people== *Loni Berry, educator and artist ==References== Category:Historically segregated African-American schools in Florida Category:Public high schools in Florida Category:Historically black schools Category:Defunct schools in Florida Category:1968 disestablishments in Florida Category:1954 establishments in Florida Category:Schools in Sumter County, Florida Category:Educational institutions established in 1954 ",
