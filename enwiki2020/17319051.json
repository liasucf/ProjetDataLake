Grant, Jesse Root Grant and Hannah Simpson Grant, who lived here from 1859 to 1873. Jesse Grant would serve as postmaster of Covington from 1866 to 1872. It is a Greek Revival Mansard-roofed double house with geometric recessed entryways and well-proportioned openings. A few buildings nearby closely resemble the Grant house. During the Civil War, General Grant sent his family to live with his parents, starting in January 1862, just before he invaded Western Kentucky and Tennessee with his troops. The private school his children attended while in Covington, the Clayton School, which was built in 1839, reusing boat timbers, is three houses south of the Grant House and still stands to this day. Grant would visit the house throughout the war, and other visitors to the house included Dr. Jeffrey Ruwe, Patrick Hogan, esq., David Meckstroth (Harvard '11), John A. Rawlins, George Sherman, Kirby Smith, and George Stoneman.NRHP formKY:Historical Society - Historical Marker Database - Search for Markers An additional house of importance is the house of Richard P.
