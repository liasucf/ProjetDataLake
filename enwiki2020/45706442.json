The foundation stone for the permanent church on Cooksey Road was laid on 15 September 1882. It was built to the designs of A.E. Dempster and the contractor was Barnsley and Sons, Rylands Street North, Birmingham.The Building News and Engineering Journal, Volume 43. 1882. p368. The nave, north transept and north aisle opened on 28 July 1883. Part of the parish was taken in 1924 to form a new parish for St Gregory the Great's Church, Small Heath. All Saints\u2019 was badly damaged in an air raid during the Second World War and demolished shortly afterwards. The name of All Saints has re-emerged in Small Heath as during the 1990s a re-organisation of churches in Small Heath was undertaken, and St Aidan\u2019s, St Gregory\u2019s, St Andrew\u2019s and St Oswald\u2019s were amalgamated. The new parish decided to retain only St Aidan\u2019s Church building, and in 1998 this was renamed All Saints. ==References== Category:Church of England church buildings in Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Churches completed in 1883 Category:Churches bombed by the Luftwaffe in Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Demolished churches in Birmingham ",
