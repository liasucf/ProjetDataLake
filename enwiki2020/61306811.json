    "text": "Gentleman Meditating Upon a Skull A Meeting of Musicians Fran\u00e7ois Puget (17 December 1651, Toulon - 6 October 1707, Marseille) was a French painter in the Baroque style; known primarily for his portraits. == Biography == His father was the architect, sculptor and painter, Pierre Puget. After a scandal involving the Finance Minister Nicolas Fouquet, in 1661, his father decided to stay in Genoa, where he had been working. Two years later, he and his mother Paule followed, and that is where he grew up. The author, Joseph Bougerel (1680-1753), believed that he was briefly a student of Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, but this has been recently questioned by Marie-Christine Gloton of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise.Marie-Christine Gloton, Pierre & Fran\u00e7ois Puget: Peintres baroques, \u00c9disud, 1985 In 1668, the family returned to Toulon and his father became the manager of the sculpture workshop at the Arsenal. He married Jeanne Jourdanis in 1677 and they had three children together. In 1679, it appears that he followed his father to Marseille, as in 1680 he is known to have created a painting for the convent of the Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary, depicting that event. At the same time, he painted his \"Portrait of a Seated Man\". Both works are now at the Mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Marseille. He then decided to stay there to assist his aging father. Between 1683 and 1688, he visited Paris three times to present his father's works to King Louis XIV at Versailles. He became a widower in 1691, but soon remarried; to Genevi\u00e8ve Mazerat, the daughter of a former (a type of Magistrate) and a relative of his father's second wife. That same year he became \"Peintre Ordinaire du Roi\". He seems also to have become the official artist for the city of Marseille, as he created portraits of numerous city office holders from 1697 to 1706. He also had some talents as an architect. After his father's death in 1694, he assumed responsibility for completing the chapel of La Vieille Charit\u00e9; especially the cupola of the dome.Jean-Jacques Gloton, \"Le probl\u00e8me de la chapelle\", in:La vieille charit\u00e9 de Marseille, Arts et livres de Provence, bulletin N\u00b0 75, 1970 p.55 Other notable works include the \"Meeting of Musicians\", which was a gift to Louis XIV. It was long believed to be a portrayal of Jean-Baptiste Lully and Philippe Quinault, but the musicians pictured were actually friends of the Puget family. He also did at least one, and possibly two portraits of his father, c.1692. All of these are in the Louvre. Several works that were originally attributed to his father have since been identified as his. ==References== == Further reading == * Marie-Christine Gloton, Jean-Jacques Gloton and Genevi\u00e8ve Bresc-Bautier, Pierre Puget: peintre, sculpteur, architecte (1620-1694), R\u00e9union des Mus\u00e9es Nationaux, 1994 * Andr\u00e9 Alauzen and Laurent Noet, Dictionnaire des peintres et sculpteurs de Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur, Jeanne Laffitte, 2006 == External links == Category:1651 births Category:1707 deaths Category:French painters Category:French portrait painters Category:French Baroque painters Category:People from Toulon ",
