The V\u00e2lsan originates in the F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 Mountains, where its source is a trough-shaped glacial hollow located between the Picuiata and Sc\u0103ri\u0219oara Mare mountains. The river flows for a mere 84.6 kilometers. Its course runs parallel to the Arge\u0219 River. The V\u00e2lsan River's mouth is located at Meri\u0219ani. In 1967 the V\u00e2lsan's course was altered significantly by the construction of a reservoir and a hydroelectric plant. ==Tributaries== The following rivers are tributaries to the river V\u00e2lsan (from source to mouth): *Left tributaries: Z\u0103nogu\u021ba, Dobroneagu, R\u00e2ul Cheii *Right tributaries: Izvorul Dimei, Izvorul Popii, Robaia, Valea P\u0103rului, \u0218optana, Topli\u021ba, Bune\u0219ti ==Haven for a Fish Species== The V\u00e2lsan, although a minor river in comparison to other European rivers, is of vital importance. This is because it is one of the few rivers that supports the fish species Romanichthys valsanicola. This species is endemic to Romania and the Danube basin. The species is regarded the most endangered species of European ichthyofauna given its small habitat range and low surviving numbers. ==References== * Trasee turistice - jude\u021bul Arge\u0219 Category:Rivers of Romania Category:Rivers of Arge\u0219 County ",
