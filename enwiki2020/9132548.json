The school is split into year groups, (year 7 through to year 13), and houses. The houses are named Oak, Ash and Elm, in recognition of the traditional royal hunting woodlands in the Macclesfield area. The school also has a sixth form, Tytherington Sixth Form College. Completely rebuilt in 1957, the school has been extended over the years including a \u00a31 million Sports Hall sponsored by the National Lottery and multi-discipline technology block. The Learning Resource Centre (comprising library and ICT suite) and sixth form block have also benefited from renovations. These improvements were part of a \u00a33.1 million capital building programme that included a new 10 classroom block, called the Jubilee Block, that was completed in summer 2012, the project was paid for by Cheshire East Council. Before this, a new art was block built in 2006. Other renovations were also carried to existing blocks in the 2011\u20132012 academic year. Classroom renovations in the Learning Resource Centre were completed in April 2012, building a cafe for sixth form students, the new block opened at the start of the 2012\u201313 academic year. During the 2014\u201315 academic year the school changed its name from Tytherington High School to Tytherington School to indicate the school's new status as an academy under the headship of Steven Jowett. == Culture and values == The school has a house system and is known for its extensive extra-curricula provision. On Thursdays the school offers a range of \"electives\" for students in the lower school. The school has a strong reputation for public speaking and in May 2019 the school won the National Rotary Club Public Speaking Championships. The school has also made it through to the 2020 Finals which were postponed as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. The uniform consists of a maroon blazer with the school crest, white shirts, a school tie, black trousers/skirt and black leather shoes. Jumpers may be worn under the blazer, along with tights for girls.
