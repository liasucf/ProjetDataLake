    "text": "Bilal U. Haq is a Pakistani-American geoscientist and poet who is currently affiliated with and divides his time between the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, and Sorbonne University\u2019s Institute of Earth Sciences in Paris, France. He is a laureate of the Prestwich Prize for geosciences from France. == Education == Bilal Haq was born in the foothills of Himalayas and moved with his parents to Pakistan at a very young age. He received his early education at St. Paul\u2019s and Central Model Schools in Karachi and Lahore. In Lahore he also earned his Bachelor and Master of Science degrees from the Government College and the Punjab University. He started his graduate research at the University of Vienna and then moved to Sweden to earn his PhD and DSc degrees in marine geoscience from the University of Stockholm. == Career == Bilal Haq has taught and/or carried out research in marine geosciences at the University of Stockholm, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, Exxon Production Research Company in Houston, the National Science Foundation in Washington, DC, the Universities of Copenhagen, Cambridge, Oxford, Paris (UPMC and Sorbonne) and Utrecht. He has consulted with, provided advice to, and/or delivered specialized courses to numerous multinational hydrocarbon and resource industries and geological surveys around the world through his consulting partnership. He was seconded to the World Bank in Washington DC in their environment department where he produced a special report on the effects of climate change and sea-level rise on the economies of developing maritime nations. In 1994 Haq was seconded by NSF to the White House's Executive Office of the President for the Federal Budget where he worked on the science budget for independent science agencies. Haq was appointed an honorary professor at both Tongji University in Shanghai and the Academia Sinica Institute of Ocean Sciences in Qingdao, China, and was a visiting professor at both Oxford and Cambridge Universities in UK. Bilal Haq is also a poet who has published four volumes of poetry, with insights into Nature and the nature of Man. His poetic license, enabled by his scientific background, has been fondly dubbed by his peers as \u201cgeopoetry\u201d. Among Haq's many services to the scientific community was his rescue of a prolific fossil site in the Shandong province of China through an international appeal, (now a National Geopark). He also conceived and helped create a paleontological geopark (together with a Chinese marine biologist academician, Zheng Shouyi) consisting of giant sculptures based on fossil micro-organisms (Foraminifera) in Zhongshan City in Guangdong Province. Since its opening in December 2009, the sculpture park has been visited by ~200,000 visitors every year, which the Smithsonian Magazine declared the second most important \"Evo-tourism\" site in the world. == Research == Bilal Haq's research covers a broad spectrum of marine geosciences, ranging from marine geology to marine sedimentology, paleoceanography, paleoclimatology, paleobiogeography, biostratigraphy, seismic, sequence and global stratigraphy, and natural gas hydrates. In the past his focus was on documenting sea-level changes along the world's continental margins and interior basins for the last 550 million years of Earth history (the complete Phanerozoic Eon). More recently he has directed his attention to influence of tectonics on the sedimentary record. Currently his focus is on quantifying the amount of total Messinian salt in the deep Mediterranean evaporite giant and its implications for tectonics in various deep basins and continental margins and the paleoceanography of the enclosed Mediterranean Sea. Haq has published over 150 research papers, book chapters and encyclopedia articles, several of them among the most highly cited in Earth sciences, and one chosen as one of the top 100 papers in geosciences of all time == Awards and honours == Bilal Haq's honors include the Shepard Medal for excellence in marine geology, the Ocean Sciences Award from the American Geophysical Union, the Antarctic Medal of the US National Science Foundation, and most recently the Prestwich Prize from the Geological Society of France. He has been recognized for his research by the award of an honorary doctorate by the Sorbonne University, election to the membership of the European Academy of Science and Letters (Academia Europaea), and to fellowships of American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Geological Society of America. Haq has also been honored by his peers with the naming of a fossil plankton species (Reticulofenetra haqii Backman) and a fossil genus (Haqius circumradiatus Roth) after him. His international appeal saved a prolific fossil site from destruction (that was late declared a National Geopark) in Shandong Province in China and he helped create two foraminiferal sculpture parks in Guangzhou Qingdao. == Haq's poetry == Bilal Haq has published four volumes of poetry: Reflections (2016), Musings (2017), Ruminations (2017) and Glimpses of Nature and Man (2018). == References == Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Paris-Sorbonne University faculty Category:Smithsonian Institution people Category:American scientists of Pakistani descent Category:Pakistani emigrants to the United States Category:Government College University, Lahore alumni Category:University of the Punjab alumni Category:Stockholm University alumni Category:University of Vienna alumni Category:American earth scientists Category:Pakistani earth scientists Category:Marine geologists ",
