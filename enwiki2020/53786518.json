    "text": "Florian Neukart is an Austrian computer scientist, mathematician, and scientific author. He is known for his work in the fields of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, particularly on how to reverse-engineer the mind by gradually replacing the biological brain with artificial components, such as quantum nano-bots, electrodes, or a neural lace. In his work, he describes methods for interpreting signals in the human brain in combination with paradigms from artificial intelligence, allowing for the creation of artificial conscious entities (ACE). ==Biography and work== Florian Neukart holds a Ph.D. in quantum computing and artificial intelligence from the Transilvania University of Brasov, as well as a master's degree in information technology from the CAMPUS02 University of Applied Sciences in Graz, and a master's degree in computer science from the Joanneum University of Applied Sciences in Kapfenberg. He works as Director, Advanced Technologies and IT Innovation at Volkswagen Group of America, where he is concerned with research in the fields of quantum computing, quantum machine learning, artificial intelligence, and materials science. Neukart, born in Bruck/Mur, is also a member of the World Economic Forum's global future council on quantum computing, and an assistant professor for quantum computing at Leiden University. He is the author of the books \"Reverse Engineering the Mind Consciously Acting Machines and Accelerated Evolution\", where he elaborates on establishing a symbiotic relationship between a biological brain, sensors, AI and quantum hard- and software, resulting in solutions for the continuous consciousness-problem as well as other state of the art problems, and \"Humankind's Hunger for Energy: The journey of a million years, from using flints to harvesting galaxies\", where he describes the evolution of humankind in terms of its energy consumption. His research continues to attract considerable public international attention. He was one of the first researchers to propose and implement quantum neural networks. He is a pioneer in applied quantum computing and among the first ones to solve real-world problems of society and environment by means of quantum computing. He was the first one to have introduced practical quantum computing in academic education worldwide. Neukart was awarded by the Science Park Austria for his work in biologically-inspired artificial intelligence software. ==References== Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century mathematicians Category:21st-century philosophers Category:21st-century physicists Category:Theoretical computer scientists Category:Austrian mathematicians Category:Austrian physicists Category:Austrian computer scientists Category:Australian science writers Category:Quantum mind Category:Quantum physicists ",
