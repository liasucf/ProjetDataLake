The Ottoman period was unfavourable to wine because of religious prohibition, but that was offset by the cult of table grapes. Although winemakers Muslims and punish sticks for the production of the drink, but Muslims are not subject to exorbitant taxes, which stimulated some move to another faith. The period of the Russian Empire and the later Soviet period led to significant development for the industry and the emergence of a true scientific approach to wine production. The adoption on April 24, 1914 of the \"Law on grape wine\" increased the vulnerability of the industry at the legislative level. The adoption on 25 May 1985 of the resolution entitled \"Measures to Overcome Drunkenness and Alcoholism\" led to substantial damage to Crimean and Soviet winemaking. It was during this period that many vineyards were destroyed and wineries were converted into extract plants. The greatest reduction in the area of vineyards and consequent reduction in the volume of wine production in Crimea occurred after the collapse of the USSR. ==Current situation== The current stage of development of viticulture and winemaking in Crimea is associated with the reorientation of producers from the Ukrainian to the Russian market, a process made more difficult by the requirement to adhere to the new regulatory framework of Russia. In general, using protectionist mechanisms, the industry has chances for development and access to foreign markets (especially the Asia-Pacific region). Notable Crimean winemakers include \"Massandra\", \"Inkerman\", \"Sun Valley\", \"Gold beam\", \"Koktebel\", \"Magarach\", \"Suter\", \"Novyi Svit\", \"Legend of Crimea\". ==See also== * Russian wine * Ukrainian wine ==References== Category:Wine regions Category:Economy of Crimea Category:Crimean culture Category:Ukrainian wine ",
