According to 9th-century Arabian historian Al- Baladhuri, Barda was established in the period of Kavadh I, who was a Sassanid ruler, while according to 14th-century Iranian historian Hamdallah Mustawfi it was from the period of Alexander the Great (336\u2013323 BC). Barda became the center of the region ruled by the governor during the Sassanid period. During the reign of Kavadh I, Barda was surrounded by fortress walls. It was a capital of Albania in the 10th century. The center of the Albanian church was moved to Barda in 552 and was occupied by Iranian feudalists in 639. Thereafter, Barda received autonomy with the help of Javanshir, who was the ruler of Alban. It became a central part of Arran Province in 752. Barda was part of the Sassanid state until the 890s. The remains of cultural items from the 2nd millennium BC to the late Middle Ages have been found and preserved in Barda. The cultural items include a Barda tomb built in 1322, remains of old city walls from the 6th century, the Ibrahim Mosque (18th century cemtery), two bridges from the 7th\u20139th centuries on the Tartar river, the Axsadan Baba tomb of the 14th century, and an eight-point tomb in the village of Guloghlular from the 18th century. All of these findings are well-preserved by the government. In addition, the Juma mosque (built in Barda city in 1905), a 19th-century bathhouse, the 19th-century Ugurbeyli Mosque, the Bahman Mirza Mausoleum, and other historical and architectural monuments were found in Shirvanli village.
