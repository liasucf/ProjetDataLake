    "text": "Dorothy L. Freeman was Missouri\u2019s first African American female lawyer. Freeman was born in St. Louis, Missouri. She attended Sumner High School and Stowe Teachers College before earning a scholarship to Lincoln University School of Law. She entered the institution in 1939 and worked as a student assistant for the library. In 1942, Freeman became the first African American female to graduate from Lincoln University School of Law and to be admitted to practice law in Missouri. Due to an instructor shortage, Freeman was approached to serve as an educator at the law school. However, the school closed briefly in 1943, and Freeman instead became the first African American female lawyer in St. Louis, Missouri. == See also == * List of first women lawyers and judges in Missouri == References == Category:20th-century American lawyers Category:Lincoln University (Missouri) alumni Category:Lawyers from St. Louis Category:Harris\u2013Stowe State University alumni Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:20th-century American women lawyers ",
