    "text": "The Knudsen paradox has been observed in experiments of channel flow with varying channel width or equivalently different pressures.Martin Knudsen, \"Die Gesetze der Molekularstr\u00f6mung und der inneren Reibungsstr\u00f6mung der Gase durch R\u00f6hren\", Annalen der Physik 333 (1909) 75\u2013130. If the normalized mass flux through the channel is plotted over the Knudsen number based on the channel width a distinct minimum is observed around Kn= 0.8. This is a paradoxical behaviour because, based on the Navier\u2013Stokes equations, one would expect the mass flux to decrease with increasing the Knudsen number. The minimum can be understood intuitively by considering the two extreme cases of very small and very large Knudsen number. For very large Kn the viscosity vanishes and a fully developed steady state channel flow shows infinite flux. On the other hand, the particles stop interacting for small Knudsen numbers. Because of the constant acceleration due to the external force, the steady state again will show infinite flux., A solution algorithm for the fluid dynamic equations based on a stochastic model for molecular motion. ==See also== *Vlasov equation *Fokker-Planck equation *Navier-Stokes equations *Vlasov-Poisson equation *Lattice Boltzmann methods *List of paradoxes ==References== Category:Partial differential equations Category:Statistical mechanics Category:Transport phenomena Category:Fluid dynamics Category:Physical paradoxes ",
