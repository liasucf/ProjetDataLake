    "text": "Ferrero SpA (), more commonly known as Ferrero Group, is an Italian manufacturer of branded chocolate and confectionery products, and the second biggest chocolate producer and confectionery company in the world. It was founded in 1946 in Alba, Piedmont, Italy, by Pietro Ferrero, a confectioner and small-time pastry maker who laid the groundwork for Nutella and famously added hazelnut to save money on chocolate. The company saw a period of tremendous growth and success under Pietro's son Michele Ferrero, who in turn handed over the daily operations to his sons, Pietro Jr. and Giovanni Ferrero (the founder's grandsons). Pietro Jr., who oversaw global business, died on April 18, 2011, in a cycling accident in South Africa at the age of 47. The Ferrero Group worldwide \u2013 now headed by CEO Giovanni Ferrero \u2013 includes 38 trading companies, 18 factories, and approximately 40,000 employees, and produces around 365,000 tonnes of Nutella each year. Ferrero International SA's headquarters is in Luxembourg. Ferrero SpA is a private company owned by the Ferrero family and has been described as \"one of the world's most secretive firms\". Reputation Institute's 2009 survey ranks Ferrero as the most reputable company in the world. The company's financial results for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2016, showed consolidated sales growth of 8.2% from the previous fiscal year. ==History== In 1946, Pietro Ferrero invented a cream of hazelnuts and cocoa, derived from gianduja and called it Pasta Gianduja. The initial product came in solid loaves wrapped in aluminium foil, which had to be sliced with a knife, and was succeeded by a spreadable version Supercrema. With assistance from his brother Giovanni Ferrero Sr., Pietro Ferrero created his new company to produce and market the initial product. Following his work, Pietro was succeeded by his son Michele Ferrero as chief executive. Michele and his wife Maria Franca relaunched his father's recipe as Nutella, which was first sold in 1964. After World War II, they opened production sites and offices abroad, and Nutella eventually became the world's leading chocolate- nut spread brand. Ferrero is the world's largest consumer of hazelnuts, buying up 25% of global production in 2014. The company is currently run by Giovanni Ferrero, grandson of Pietro and son of Michele Ferrero. The company places great emphasis on secrecy, reportedly to guard against industrial espionage. It has never held a press conference and does not allow media visits to its plants. Ferrero's products are made with machines designed by an in-house engineering department. In 2014, Ferrero acquired Oltan Group, the largest hazelnut supplier in the world. Ferrero acquired the British chocolate retailer Thorntons in June 2015 for \u00a3112 million. In 2016, Ferrero SpA acquired Belgian biscuit brands Delacre and DeliChoc from United Biscuits. In March 2017, Ferrero SpA bought the chocolate maker Fannie May from 1-800-Flowers.com. The deal closed on May 30, 2017, and Ferrero paid $115 million. Ferrero mentioned that they hope to expand Fannie May, with locations across the nation, not just in Chicago. On 30 March 2017, it was announced that Lapo Civiletti would be the first non-family CEO in the history of the company, taking up the role from 1 September, while Giovanni Ferrero would become the executive chairman, focusing on long-term strategy. In October 2017, Ferrero announced that they would acquire the Ferrara Candy Company. The acquisition was completed that December. On 16 January 2018, it was reported that Ferrero was purchasing Nestl\u00e9's American confectionery business for $2.8 billion. The deal included such brands as Baby Ruth, Crunch Bar and Butterfinger, but did not affect Nestl\u00e9's confectionery business elsewhere, and did not include Kit Kat or the Toll House baking line.Zlati Meyer,\u201cNestle is selling its U.S. candy business to Ferrero for about $2.8 billion\u201d, USA TODAY 16 January 2018 The acquisition was completed in March 2018.
