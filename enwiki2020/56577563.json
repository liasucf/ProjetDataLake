She married the future earl on 25 January 1872, a year before he succeeded to his father's titles. As Lord Garlies, he was Conservative MP for Wigtownshire, thus representing the same party as his brother-in-law. There were no children from their marriage. The earl died in 1901, aged 65, and was succeeded in the earldom by his brother Randolph Henry Stewart, 11th Earl of Galloway. A portrait photograph of the countess, taken during the 1870s by John Watkins, is held by London's National Gallery.
