    "text": "\"Sky\" is a song co-written and recorded by British singer and DJ Sonique. It was released in September 2000 as the third single from the album, Hear My Cry, peaking at number two on the UK Singles Chart and number one in Romania. ==Reviewers== On the website ukmix.org there are two reviews for Sky. Ben Cook gave the song 4 of 5 stars with the opinion: Sonique returns to follow up the massive single \"It Feels So Good\" with a much better song. \"Sky\" is a sort of eurodance/trance track, similar in style to her previous one. It's been getting plenty of radio airplay, so this will almost certainly be a Top 10 hit. Robert Black gave 5 of 5 stars: After the absolutely massive success of \"It Feels So Good\", it's time for Sonique's all important second single. The former was No. 1 for three weeks, and she could top the chart again with this fantastic grower. It's similar in style to \"It Feels So Good\" in some ways, though perhaps better. With powerful vocals, stomping beats and a great atmosphere, it's obvious Sonique will be around for quite some time.https://www.ukmix.org/reviews/release.php?release_id=248 ==Track listing== #\"Sky\" (Radio Edit) #\"Sky\" (Sharam Jey Remix) #\"Sky\" (The Conductor & The Cowboy Remix) ==Official versions== * \"Sky\" (Radio Edit) * \"Sky\" (Sharam Jey Remix) * \"Sky\" (The Conductor & The Cowboy Remix) * \"Sky\" (Sonique Mix) ==Charts and certifications== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (2000) !Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |15 |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Greece (IFPI) |3 |- !scope=\"row\"|Hungary (Mahasz) |2 |- !scope=\"row\"|Iceland (\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40) |23 |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Ireland Dance (IRMA) |6 |- |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Poland (Polish Singles Chart) |1 |- !scope=\"row\"|Portugal (AFP) |5 |- !scope=\"row\"|Romania (Romanian Top 100) |1 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|US Hot Dance Singles Sales (Billboard) |40 |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (2000) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |81 |- !scope=\"row\"|Romania (Romanian Top 100) |7 |- !scope=\"row\"|Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) |90 |} {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (2001) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA) |86 |} ===Certifications=== ==References== Category:2000 singles Category:1999 songs Category:Sonique (musician) songs Category:Songs written by Rick Nowels Category:Number-one singles in Poland Category:Number-one singles in Romania ",
