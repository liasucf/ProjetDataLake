    "text": "Purvis Jennings \"Jim\" Ferree (born June 10, 1931) is an American professional golfer who played on the PGA Tour and the Senior PGA Tour. Born in Pinebluff, North Carolina, Ferree grew up in Winston-Salem and graduated from Reynolds High School. He learned the game of golf from his father, Purvis, long-time pro at Winston-Salem's Old Town Golf Club. Ferree played college golf at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. Following service in the U.S. Army, he turned professional in late 1955. Ferree had one PGA Tour win during his regular career years. He was regarded as one of the very best in the game in the tee-to-green ball-striking phase of the game, but putting was always his weakness. He spent most of his thirties and forties as the director of golf at Long Cove Club in Hilton Head, South Carolina. Ferree was later a club pro and joined the Senior PGA Tour at age fifty in 1981. He was chosen by PGA Commissioner Deane Beman to be the model for the knickers-wearing player on the Senior Tour's logo. He shares the Georgia-Pacific Grand Champions record for most victories (9) with two other golfers. He was the Senior PGA Tour's Comeback Player of the Year in 1993. In 1991, he became the first golfer inducted into the University of North Carolina's Hall of Fame. He lives in Hilton Head, South Carolina with his wife, Karen, also a former champion golfer. ==Professional wins (19)== ===PGA Tour wins (1)=== *1958 Vancouver Open Invitational ===Other wins (12)=== this list is probably incomplete *1954 Forsyth County tournament *1955 Forsyth County tournament *1958 British Columbia Centennial Open *1961 Jamaica Open *1962 Panama Open *1963 Maracaibo Open Invitational *1966 Carolinas PGA Championship *1967 Georgia PGA Championship *1977 Tri-State Open *1978 Tri-State PGA Championship *1981 Tri- State PGA Championship *1983 Tri-State Open ===Senior PGA Tour wins (2)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No.!!Date!!Tournament!!Winning score!!To par!!Margin of victory!!Runners-up |- |align=center|1 |align=right|Jul 20, 1986 |Greater Grand Rapids Open |align=right|68-66-70=204 |align=center|\u20139 |Playoff | Gene Littler, Chi-Chi Rodr\u00edguez |- |align=center|2 |align=right|May 26, 1991 |Bell Atlantic Classic |align=right|67-69-72=208 |align=center|\u20138 |2 strokes | Jim Colbert, Lee Trevino |} Senior PGA Tour playoff record (1\u20133) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No.!!Year!!Tournament!!Opponent(s)!!Result |-style=\"background:#F08080;\" |align=center|1 |1986 |The Greenbrier American Express Championship | Don January |Lost to par on first extra hole |-style=\"background:#D0F0C0;\" |align=center|2 |1986 |Greater Grand Rapids Open | Gene Littler, Chi-Chi Rodr\u00edguez |Won with birdie on first extra hole |-style=\"background:#F08080;\" |align=center|3 |1987 |Seniors International Golf Championship | Al Geiberger |Lost to birdie on second extra hole |-style=\"background:#F08080;\" |align=center|4 |1989 |GTE Suncoast Classic | Bob Charles, Harold Henning, Dave Hill |Charles won with birdie on third extra hole Ferree and Hill eliminated with birdie on first hole |} ===Other senior wins (4)=== this list is probably incomplete *1997 Liberty Mutual Legends of Golf - Demaret Division (with George Bayer) *2002 Liberty Mutual Legends of Golf - Demaret Division (with Miller Barber) *2003 Liberty Mutual Legends of Golf - Demaret Division (with Miller Barber) *2006 Grand Champions team better-ball (with Jack Fleck) ==U.S. national team appearances== *PGA Cup: 1979 ==Video== *YouTube \u2013 Jim Ferree interview (2014) ==References== ==External links== * *Carolinas Golf Hall of Fame \u2013 Jim Ferree Category:American male golfers Category:North Carolina Tar Heels men's golfers Category:PGA Tour golfers Category:PGA Tour Champions golfers Category:Golfers from North Carolina Category:Sportspeople from Winston-Salem, North Carolina Category:People from Hilton Head, South Carolina Category:1931 births Category:Living people ",
