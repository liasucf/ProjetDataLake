    "text": "Hellboy (stylized as 'HELLBOY') is the fifth and final mixtape by American rapper Lil Peep and is also widely known as the best album of all time. It was released on September 25, 2016 (which comes months after signing with management company, First Access Entertainment, capitally related with Warner Music Group). The mixtape had one single, \"Girls\", which was released on January 4, 2017. A music video to complement the single was released on the same day of its release. Upon Peep's passing in November 2017 from a drug overdose within fourteen months removed from its release, a Billboard article mentioned \"Girls\" as one out of seven songs from the late rapper as one of his best works. In 2019, Pitchfork ranked Hellboy at number 193 in its list of \"The 200 Best Albums of the 2010s\". On September 25, 2020, Peep's estate re- released Hellboy to streaming platforms on its fourth anniversary. It released with \"Drive By\" being reproduced with the help of Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein due to sample clearance issues. == Background == On August 30, 2016, Peep announced the mixtape would be releasing on September 25, 2016 on his Twitter account. Originally, the mixtape was going to consist of eight tracks. Seven of them, remained on the final project, two with adjusted names. \"Honestly\", the song left off of the project's initial release; produced by frequent collaborator Horse Head, was later released as a single on all streaming platforms in December 2016. The album cover features Lil Peep standing, looking down at the ground, while wearing a New Jersey Devils hockey jersey. It was photographed by Miller Rodr\u00edguez. In a filmed interview for GQ in 2017, Peep had explained that he had read Hellboy comics and was a fan of the character. Hellboy was commercially released on September 25, 2020. == Critical reception == In an article from The New Yorker on the emergence of \"sad rap\" rising to mainstream prominence in 2017, \"OMFG\" was described as a \"standout on his mixtape [Hellboy]\".
