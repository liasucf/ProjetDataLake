    "text": "and are 2010 role-playing video games developed by Game Freak, published by The Pok\u00e9mon Company and Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. They are the first installments in the fifth generation of the Pok\u00e9mon video game series. First released in Japan on 18 September 2010, they were later released in Europe on 4 March 2011, in North America on 6 March 2011, and Australia on 10 March 2011. Similar to previous installments of the series, the two games follow the journey of a young Pok\u00e9mon trainer through the region of Unova, as they train Pok\u00e9mon used to compete against other trainers, while thwarting the schemes of the criminal organization Team Plasma. Black and White introduced 156 new Pok\u00e9mon to the franchise, 5 more than the previous record holder Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue, as well as many new features, including a seasonal cycle, rotation battles, fully animated Pok\u00e9mon sprites and triple battles. Both titles are independent of each other, but feature largely the same plot, and while both can be played separately, trading Pok\u00e9mon between both of the games is necessary in order to complete the games' Pok\u00e9dex. Upon their release, Black and White received positive reviews; critics praised the advancements in gameplay. Reviewers, however, were divided on some of the character designs and Pok\u00e9mon designs, and some critics felt that the games did not innovate as much as expected. Nevertheless, the games were commercial successes; prior to the games' Japanese release, Black and White sold one million consumer pre- orders and became the fastest Nintendo DS titles to sell five million copies. As of September 2017, the games' combined sales have reached 15.64 million, putting them amongst the best-selling games for the Nintendo DS, but still being outsold by their predecessors, Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl. Sequels to Pok\u00e9mon Black and White, Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and Pok\u00e9mon White 2, were released in Japan for the Nintendo DS in June 2012, with October releases in North America, Europe, and Australia. ==Gameplay== Pok\u00e9mon Black and White are role- playing video games with adventure elements, presented in a third-person, overhead perspective. There are three basic screens: an overworld, in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures their party, items, or gameplay settings. The player controls a Pok\u00e9mon Trainer who begins the game with a single Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon Black instruction manual, p. 7. and is able to capture more using Pok\u00e9 Balls.Pok\u00e9mon Black instruction manual, p. 19. Like all other Trainers, the player can carry up to six Pok\u00e9mon at one time. However, the game also includes a network of PCs to store hundreds of Pok\u00e9mon. PCs are found in certain buildings\u2014named, \"Pok\u00e9mon Centers\", where the player can heal their Pok\u00e9mon when they have low health or has fainted.Pok\u00e9mon Black instruction manual, p. 21. Pok\u00e9mon can learn up to four moves, including attacking moves, healing moves, and moves that inflict status conditions on the opponent.Pok\u00e9mon Black instruction manual, p. 18. They have six stats that affect battle performance: maximum hit points (HP), Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. Attack and Special Attack are distinguished from Defense and Special Defense by the types of moves being considered: generally, moves involving physical exertion are physical, while moves involving supernatural or elemental powers are special. Moves are classed as one of seventeen types: Normal, Water, Grass, Fire, Electric, Ghost, Bug, Fighting, Ice, Steel, Rock, Poison, Psychic, Dark, Dragon, Ground, and Flying; Pok\u00e9mon can have one or two types. Generally, most of a Pok\u00e9mon's moves correspond to its typing. A Pok\u00e9mon's type makes it vulnerable or resistant to others; for example, Fire-type Pok\u00e9mon are weak to Water-type moves, while Grass-type moves do little damage to them and Electric-type moves do normal damage. When the player encounters a wild Pok\u00e9mon or is challenged by another Trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen where the Pok\u00e9mon fight. During battle, the player may use a move, use an item, switch the active Pok\u00e9mon, or flee. However, the player cannot flee a battle against another Trainer or against certain wild Pok\u00e9mon that are stronger than the player's. When a Pok\u00e9mon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints until it is revived.Pok\u00e9mon Black instruction manual, pp. 17\u201318. If an opposing Pok\u00e9mon faints, all of the player's Pok\u00e9mon who participated in defeating it receive experience points. After accumulating enough experience points, a Pok\u00e9mon may level up, increasing its stats.Pok\u00e9mon Black instruction manual, p. 20. Many Pok\u00e9mon evolve into other forms after certain conditions are met, usually after reaching a certain level threshold or by having a certain item used on them. At the \"Day Care\" location, the player can breed two of their Pok\u00e9mon\u2014usually, a male and a female\u2014to create Eggs that hatch into baby Pok\u00e9mon at level 1. Pok\u00e9mon Black and White takes place in the Unova region, based on New York City. As with all regions, Unova consists of a number of cities and towns connected by \"Routes\". Random encounters may take place in tall grass along routes or in bodies of water. The player occasionally battles Trainers in cities and towns, as well as along routes. In addition, eight of the game's cities and towns are homes to \"Gym Leaders\", powerful Trainers specializing in certain types of Pok\u00e9mon; beating a Gym Leader gives the player a \"Badge\". All eight Badges are needed to unlock the Pok\u00e9mon League,Pok\u00e9mon Black instruction manual, p. 10. where the player faces off against the \"Elite Four\" and, finally, the Champion. Across Unova, items can be found on the ground or purchased from \"Pok\u00e9 Marts\". For example, Hyper Potions restore HP, Antidotes cure poisoning, and Revives revitalize fainted Pok\u00e9mon. TMs (Technical Machines) teach moves to Pok\u00e9mon, and HMs (Hidden Machines) are a special class of TMs for important moves that allow the player to traverse the environment. The \"Surf\" HM move, for example, is used to cross bodies of water.Pok\u00e9mon Black instruction manual, p. 23. ===New features=== The graphics have been improved from Diamond and Pearl. The dialog boxes of previous games have been changed to speech balloons that appear over other characters' heads, allowing more than one character to speak at once. Japanese players can have kanji appear on screen, rather than only hiragana and katakana. During battles, the sprites of the Pok\u00e9mon are fully animated and the camera changes position to highlight specific parts of the battle. In addition to continuing the day and night cycle introduced in Gold and Silver, Black and White introduces a seasonal cycle, with the seasons advancing every month rather than being linked to the calendar. Outside areas appear differently depending on the season, such as changing of leaves in autumn or snow on the ground in winter. Certain areas are only accessible during certain seasons, and different Pok\u00e9mon can be found in the wild in winter where others are encountered in the other seasons. The Pok\u00e9mon Deerling and Sawsbuck change their physical appearance to match the seasons. There are two new battle mechanics: Triple Battles and Rotation Battles. In Triple Battles, both teams must send out three Pok\u00e9mon in a row at once; Some moves only allow Pok\u00e9mon on the left or right side to attack the opponent's Pok\u00e9mon on the same side or in the center. Changing position takes up one turn. In Rotation Battles, each side sends out three Pok\u00e9mon at once, but they are arranged in a circle that can be rotated at will. Black has more Rotation Battles than Triple Battles, and the opposite is true in White. Another introduction is Combination Moves: a starter Pok\u00e9mon can be taught one of three moves, and using them together in Double or Triple battles produces more powerful attacks. In the wild, walking through darker-colored tall grass can trigger Double Battles against wild Pok\u00e9mon rather than only Single Battles with lighter-colored grass. Occasionally, the player can find rustling patches of grass and rippling water, where they can encounter either a rare Pok\u00e9mon, a Pok\u00e9mon more common in the opposite game version, or the highest evolutionary form of a Pok\u00e9mon whose lower forms can normally be found in the area. This is the only way to capture Pok\u00e9mon such as Audino, Emolga, and Alomomola. Also, dust clouds in caves and the shadows of flying Pok\u00e9mon on certain bridges can be entered to either find a rare item or encounter Drilbur, Excadrill, Ducklett, or Swanna, none of which can be found in the wild otherwise. Occasionally, when throwing a Pok\u00e9 Ball, the capture rate is highly increased, triggered by a random event. There are also new side-games and sidequests: the player can compete in Pok\u00e9mon Musicals, a side-game similar to the Pok\u00e9mon Contests of previous games; the Battle Subway, similar to the Battle Towers and Battle Frontiers of previous games; and on the Royal Unova, a cruise ship that the player can ride and fight Trainers aboard to win otherwise rare items. ===Connectivity to other devices=== IR or Wi-Fi The C-Gear replaces the Pok\u00e9tech from Diamond and Pearl on the Nintendo DS's bottom screen. It controls the game's wireless capabilities, including infrared (IR) communication for battling and trading, wireless communications in the Xtranceiver video chat access to the Entralink to transfer content from the Pok\u00e9mon Dream World, using the Wi-Fi to sync with the Pok\u00e9mon Global Link servers, and the new \"Pass By mode\" which allows the game to communicate with other copies through infrared while the DS is asleep. The Feeling Check function tests the compatibility between two players and awards them items accordingly. In the \"Pass By\" feature, the player answers various survey questions and receives one of several items depending on how many other players they have connected with. In the \"Random Matchup\" feature, the player can battle others randomly. When playing against others online or in IR battles, a new mechanic called the Wonder Launcher allows healing items to be used in battle. Two features were added to transfer Pok\u00e9mon from older DS Pok\u00e9mon games to Black and White. For normal transfer, the Pok\u00e9 Transfer feature is available after completion of the main storyline. Unlike the \"Pal Park\" feature from previous games, the Pok\u00e9 Transfer is a mini-game in which after six Pok\u00e9mon are transferred, the player uses the touch screen to launch Pok\u00e9 Balls at the transferred Pok\u00e9mon to catch them within a time limit. Another feature called the Relocator is used to transfer the Pok\u00e9mon given away in promotions for the film Pok\u00e9mon: Zoroark: Master of Illusions so the player can obtain the rare Pok\u00e9mon Zorua and Zoroark. Unlike the Pok\u00e9 Transfer, this is available before the main game is completed. Unique to Black and White is the Pok\u00e9mon Dream World, which is dependent on the official Pok\u00e9mon Global Link website. Here, the player can befriend Pok\u00e9mon that are not normally obtainable in-game and that have unique abilities. This occurs after syncing the game back with the Dream World, similarly to the Pok\u00e9walker from HeartGold and SoulSilver. The player can maintain a house in the Dream World that other players can visit as well as grow berries. In addition to allowing access to Pok\u00e9mon acquired in the Dream World, the Entralink also enables players to interact with each other and play side-games. These side- games award points that can be traded for temporary powers such as increasing experience, improving capture rate, or lowering prices of items in Pok\u00e9 Marts. ==Plot== ===Setting=== New York City was used as the basis for Unova. Specifically, Castelia City features tall buildings and an urban setting and is the region's \"central metropolis\". The Brooklyn Bridge was used as inspiration for the Skyarrow Bridge in Unova Black and White are set in the Unova region, a continental mass located far away from the previous regions, Kanto, Johto, Hoenn and Sinnoh. Unlike the previous regions which were based on real locations in Japan, Unova is modeled after New York City, an idea developed by game director Junichi Masuda when he visited the city for the launch of Diamond and Pearl. One particular example of this is Castelia City, which serves as the region's central metropolis and had such inspirations as its \"Brooklyn Bridge-style suspension bridge\" and its \"huge skyscrapers\". Masuda also wanted to convey a \"feeling of communities\" in Castelia's streets. Unova is host to large urban areas, a harbor, an airport, an amusement park, several bridges, and several mountain ranges. In addition to a diversity of new landscapes, the Unova region is also home to a diversity of people who vary in skin tone and occupation. The region's Japanese name is derived from the Japanese words and ; the many kinds of people and Pok\u00e9mon seen up close look like only one kind of life from afar. ===Story=== Like previous Pok\u00e9mon games, Black and White both follow a linear storyline; the main events occur in a fixed order. The protagonist of Pok\u00e9mon Black and White is a teenager who sets out on a journey through Unova to become the Pok\u00e9mon master. At the beginning of the games, the player chooses either Snivy, Tepig or Oshawott as their starter Pok\u00e9mon as a gift from Professor Juniper. The protagonist's friends, Cheren and Bianca, are also rival Pok\u00e9mon Trainers who occasionally battle the player; Cheren will choose the Pok\u00e9mon with a type advantage against the player's, while Bianca will choose the Pok\u00e9mon with a type disadvantage. The player's primary goal is to obtain the eight Gym Badges of Unova and ultimately challenge the Elite Four of the Pok\u00e9mon League, and its Champion, to complete the main story. In addition to the standard gameplay, the player will also have to defeat the games' main antagonist force, Team Plasma, a Knights Templar-esque group who claim that Pok\u00e9mon are oppressed by humanity and seek to liberate them from their trainers. Team Plasma is led by N, a young man who was brought up alongside Pok\u00e9mon and sees them as friends rather than tools for sport. Throughout the game, the player has some encounters with N, who claims that by capturing one of the legendary Pok\u00e9mon (Reshiram and Zekrom) of Unova and defeating the Pok\u00e9mon Champion Alder, he will be recognized as Unova's hero and will be able to convince the humans to part with their Pok\u00e9mon. Depending on the game version, N will capture Zekrom in Black or Reshiram in White. After the player defeats the Elite Four and enters the Champion's chamber, he or she finds that N has defeated Alder and become the newest Pok\u00e9mon Champion. Soon after, he summons a large castle that surrounds the Pok\u00e9mon League, challenging the player to find him to take part in one final battle. When the player finally reaches him, Reshiram in Black or Zekrom in White appears before the player, and the player must capture the legendary Pok\u00e9mon before challenging N. After his defeat, N laments the possibility that his ideals are mistaken, Ghetsis intrudes and angrily reveals that his true intentions were to use N to ensure that he would be the only human left with control over Pok\u00e9mon and use them to rule the world. In his rage, Ghetsis challenges the player to battle. After Ghetsis's defeat, he is arrested, allowing Alder to resume his position as the Pok\u00e9mon Champion of the Unova region. N then thanks the player for helping realize his mistake about the nature of the relationship between people and their Pok\u00e9mon before leaving the castle on his captured Pok\u00e9mon to a far-off land. After Team Plasma's defeat, Looker arrives in Unova and tasks the player with finding the remaining Sages of Team Plasma, so they can be brought to justice. The player can also challenge the Elite Four once again, and challenge Alder, ultimately becoming the Unova region's new Pok\u00e9mon Champion. The player also gains access to the eastern portion of Unova, which contains Pok\u00e9mon from the previous games in the series, as well as access to an area unique to each game version: the ultra-metropolitan Black City, home to powerful Pok\u00e9mon trainers; and the White Forest, home to humans and Pok\u00e9mon living in harmony. Cynthia, a former Champion of the Sinnoh region, is also found in this area of the game and can be challenged. A non-player character named after Shigeki Morimoto, a Game Freak programmer, creature designer, and the director of the Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver games, can also be found and battled in the game. ==Development== Junichi Masuda was responsible for the direction and the music of the games. On 29 January 2010, The Pok\u00e9mon Company announced that a new game was in development for the Nintendo DS to be released later that year. Director Junichi Masuda stated that several aspects of the series were being revamped for the new generation. On 9 April 2010, the Japanese website updated with the titles of the versions as Pok\u00e9mon Black and White and announced a Q3 2010 release date. The games feature an improved visual style from other Pok\u00e9mon games, with an increased use of 3D computer graphics than any other of the handheld series. It also has a special feature that allows the user to upload their saved game to the Internet, allowing them to do certain things on an official website. On 3 August 2010, Masuda announced on his blog that the Black and White game versions will initially only contain brand-new Pok\u00e9mon to evoke a feeling of it being a brand-new game, like when the original Pok\u00e9mon games were first released. In all of the games following the first generation, there were a series of new Pok\u00e9mon introduced interspersed with Pok\u00e9mon from the previous generations. For example, Pikachu was introduced in Red and Green and was obtainable in Blue, Yellow and all subsequent main series games; however, Pikachu will not be obtainable in Black and White from the start of the game. It was later confirmed that Black and White are region locked on the Nintendo DSi and 3DS. Game director and composer Junichi Masuda stated that to keep the games fresh, he looks at every previous element to decide what to adapt to the new game, stating \"people may not like what they like in the past, trend wise\". He explained the new battle styles, stating that while triple battles take more strategy, rotation battles take more luck to win. Masuda stated that their goal when making the games was to make it fun for new players, but they also wanted to get players who have not played the series in a while to come back. He said that it was hard to find that balance to satisfy both kinds of players. For the new players, there is good explanation in how to play, while for old players, they incorporated the C-Gear, which makes the ability to trade and battle easier. When asked about the decision to introduce over 150 new species of Pok\u00e9mon, Masuda stated that they did this so old players would not be able to know what is a good Pok\u00e9mon to use, and it would level the playing ground for new players. ===Music=== is a four-disc soundtrack featuring the games' music scored by Masuda, Go Ichinose, Shota Kageyama, Hitomi Sato, Morikazu Aoki, Minako Adachi, and Satoshi Nohara. The soundtrack was released on 20 October 2010, in Japan. Ichinose was in charge of directing all Pok\u00e9mon voices for the game while Adachi produced all sound effects. ==Promotion and release== Pok\u00e9mon Black and White were released in Japan on 18 September 2010. They were later released in Europe on 4 March 2011, in North America on 6 March 2011, and in Australia on 10 March 2011. ===Japanese release=== A silhouette of a new Pok\u00e9mon was shown by Junichi Masuda on the 7 February 2010 episode of Pok\u00e9mon Sunday, stated to be in the film for the summer and to be identified in a future episode on 21 February. This new Pok\u00e9mon was also featured in the March 2010 issue of CoroCoro Comic available on 15 February. Since then, the Pok\u00e9mon has been named \"Zoroark\", and it evolves from a Pok\u00e9mon named \"Zorua\". Both were featured in the film Pocket Monsters Diamond & Pearl The Movie: Phantom Ruler: Zoroark. For pre- order ticket holders, an alternate-colored Raikou, Entei, or Suicune was available for transfer to their Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, or SoulSilver games. At the theater, players would be able to download a Celebi to the same games. These Pok\u00e9mon would activate special events in Black and White involving Zoroark and Zorua, respectively. On 18 April 2010, the episode of Pok\u00e9mon Sunday showed game footage of a player character walking around in a 3D environment and a single screenshot depicting a battle between the player's Zoroark and an enemy Zorua. Host Shoko Nakagawa made note of how the player's Zoroark's sprite was a full body sprite as viewed from behind, when in the past all such sprites only showed a smaller portion of the player's Pok\u00e9mon's body.Pok\u00e9mon Sunday, 2010-04-18 On 9 May 2010, the episode of Pok\u00e9mon Sunday revealed silhouettes of the three Pok\u00e9mon available to choose from at the beginning of the games,Pok\u00e9mon Sunday, 2010-05-09 which were later revealed to be the Grass Snake Pok\u00e9mon Tsutarja, the Fire Pig Pok\u00e9mon Pokabu, and the Sea Otter Pok\u00e9mon Mijumaru. Other information revealed is that the game takes place in the Isshu Region which includes the Hiun City metropolis. On 16 May 2010, the episode of Pok\u00e9mon Sunday showed game battle footage, illustrating the new in-battle animations and dynamic camera positioning; also described were Zoroark's Illusion ability and the special Zoroark acquired by the movie ticket pre-order gift Pok\u00e9mon.Pok\u00e9mon Sunday, 2010-05-16 On 28 May 2010, both the official Japanese and English Pok\u00e9mon websites revealed names and designs of the two major legendary Pok\u00e9mon of these games, who also serve as the game version mascots: the White Yang Pok\u00e9mon Reshiram for Pok\u00e9mon Black and the Black Yin Pok\u00e9mon Zekrom for Pok\u00e9mon White. The July 2010 issue of CoroCoro Comic revealed the C-Gear wireless interactivity features, the ability to upload game data to the internet and the player's computer, several brand-new Pok\u00e9mon, new Pok\u00e9mon moves, Reshiram and Zekrom's Pok\u00e9mon types, details on the Celebi / Zorua event, and a new character: Professor Araragi, the first female Pok\u00e9mon professor to appear in the video games.CoroCoro Comic, July 2010 The 27 June 2010, episode of Pok\u00e9mon Sunday, made the announcement of the release date as 18 September 2010, and a yet-to-be named character.Pok\u00e9mon Sunday, 2010-06-27 The 28 June episode of Oha Suta, showed a trailer, which included its release date, new gameplay footage, several new characters, more new Pok\u00e9mon, and a three-on-three battle system.Oha Suta, 2010-06-28 The August 2010 issue of CoroCoro Comic elaborated upon many new game mechanics: the three-on-three system, the online Global Link system, an online Dream World that can allow for access to other Pok\u00e9mon, access to an area that uses the Wi-Fi called the Hilink (similar to the Underground), a special feature called the Live Caster for video chat on the Nintendo DSi and Nintendo 3DS, kanji support, aesthetic differences between the two versions of the game, areas exclusive to the game versions, new characters, new moves, new abilities, and new Pok\u00e9mon.CoroCoro Comic, August 2010 The 25 July 2010, episode of Pok\u00e9mon Sunday introduced the new phantom Pok\u00e9mon Victini,Pok\u00e9mon Sunday, 2010-07-25 which initially appeared in a trailer for the 2011 Pok\u00e9mon film that was shown with screenings of Phantom Ruler: Zoroark. It is noted to be Pok\u00e9mon No. 000 in Isshu's regional Pok\u00e9dex, and is only accessible by downloading a special item from Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, DS Stations, and Nintendo Zones (such as those found in Japanese McDonald's restaurants) to a game save. This was initially available for a month following the games' release date. Another promotional Pok\u00e9mon given out after the games' release is a Kumasyun, a Pok\u00e9mon that is difficult to find in the games unless it is during the games' winter season. On the day of the Japanese release, Nintendo of America sent cease and desist letters to two English language Pok\u00e9mon fansites, Pok\u00e9Beach and Serebii, after they published screenshots and various other media from the newly released games. Nintendo claimed the posting of the media was infringing copyright and noted their intention to shut down the websites under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act unless the media was removed. The screenshots were subsequently taken down from both websites. Luke Plunkett of video game blog Kotaku initially speculated that Nintendo of America issued the cease and desist letters over the belief that the images were illegally obtained via a ROM image; however, Jon Sahagian of Pok\u00e9Beach stated the images in question had been obtained from the Japanese forum 2channel. Charlie Scibetta, Nintendo of America's senior director of corporate communications, later stated that it was the choice of images that were of concern to the company. In a statement to Kotaku, he said, \"Nintendo supports and appreciates the efforts that Pok\u00e9mon fans go through to create fan sites. In most cases there is no issue with the content that is posted, but on this occasion we had to contact a select few websites to ask them to take down confidential images\". ===International release=== The foreign promotion for the games began on 22 November 2010, when the official website for the North American, European, and Australian markets was updated, which included the localized names of the starter Pok\u00e9mon (Snivy, Tepig and Oshawott) in English, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, and Spanish markets and the games' setting in the Unova region. Floats of version mascots Reshiram and Zekrom accompanied the Pikachu balloon during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on 25 November 2010, the following Thursday. On 27 December 2010, the official websites for the international releases updated once more, revealing the English names for many of the first Pok\u00e9mon revealed during the promotion for the Japanese release. In addition, the English names for the game location Hiun City and the character Professor Araragi were revealed to be Castelia City and Professor Juniper, respectively. Starting on 3 January and lasting until 9 January 2011, in the United States, players of Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, and SoulSilver were able to visit GameStop stores to download the special shiny Raikou that was previously given out for Phantom Ruler: Zoroark pre-order ticket holders in Japan. Similar downloads would be available for the shiny Entei from 17 to 23 January, and shiny Suicune from 31 January to 6 February. All three of these Pok\u00e9mon still enabled the event for Zoroark in the North American Black and White versions. These three Pok\u00e9mon were later distributed via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection for European, Australian, and North American markets (for a second time) starting 7 to 13 February with Raikou, again, with subsequent staggered releases for Entei and Suicune throughout February. The Celebi event was run in North America and distributed through GameStop stores from 21 February to 6 March 2011, or it could be acquired from the tour promoting the Black and White games that began on 5 February 2011. In France and Spain, this same Celebi was available through various retailers from 1 February through 3 March 2011. Italian players could get this Celebi from specific video game retailers from 21 January through 3 March. The event to distribute the item to allow players to capture Victini was also run following the games' release internationally. North American players were able to download the item from Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection from 6 March to 10 April 2011. European players were able to get the item from 4 March to 22 April. Australian players were able to download it from 10 March to 28 April 2011. ===Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2=== ==Reception== ===Critical response=== Pok\u00e9mon Black and White have received largely positive reviews by critics, having an aggregate score of 87% on Metacritic, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Japanese magazine Famitsu Weekly awarded the game a perfect 40/40 score, becoming the 15th game to receive such a distinction, as well as obtaining the highest score ever given to a Pok\u00e9mon video game by the publication. Game Informers Annette Gonzalez remarked that \"Pok\u00e9mon Black and White do a great job building upon already solid features and taking them to the next level.\" VideoGamer.coms Jamin Smith criticized the games for not innovating as much as some people would have liked, but stated that \"rest assured in the knowledge that Black and White are damn fine games; the best the series has to offer.\" Official Nintendo Magazine referred to them as \"A beautiful refinement of a great series [...] the best Pok\u00e9mon ever.\" Nintendo Power expressed that \"the Pok\u00e9mon series's latest pair of adventures is as addictive as ever.\" Edge acknowledged that \"where next for Pok\u00e9mon, Black and White don't suggest any answers, but they do remind us why we'd care in the first place.\" IGN gave the games a 9/10, a higher rating than any of the other Nintendo DS Pok\u00e9mon games. The review praised the games for renewing interest in the series, though criticized some of the new Pok\u00e9mon designs, explaining that \"aside from a weaker lineup of monsters (largely an aesthetic complaint), this is the best Pok\u00e9mon has to offer on every level, renewing my waning interest in monster battling\". Jeremy Parish of Retronauts criticized Black and White, commenting that he grew tired of it shortly after starting and feeling like it was too similar to all previous Pok\u00e9mon games. He further went on to say that EVs and IVs, invisible mechanics in the game, are not necessarily beneficial. By contrast, he noted that it would be great to new players. He also compared it to the Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon games and Final Fantasy XIII, arguing that they all share the common element of being bad before they get good. Fellow Retronauts contributor Justin Haywald criticized the games' release on the DS, which had received two main Pok\u00e9mon series games published before them. GamesRadar editor Carolyn Gudmundson stated \"It may not break the Pokemon mold, but Black and White offers enough new content coupled with the series' classic, deep battle mechanics to make it endlessly playable. If you could only play one game for the rest of your life, this would be a wise choice.\" Some people criticized the designs of the Generation V Pok\u00e9mon, saying that some of them were good, but many were uninspired. ===Commercial performance=== In August 2010, one month before the games' release in Japan, Pok\u00e9mon Black and White gained a total of 1.08 million pre-orders, becoming the fastest game on the Nintendo DS to break the one million mark. In the first two days on sale, it sold more than 2.6 million copies, becoming the biggest launch in the series history in Japan. By 3 November, the games had sold over 4.3 million copies in Japan. As of 9 January 2011, the games became the fastest DS titles to sell five million copies. Upon its release in the UK, White and Black took the #1 and #2 spots respectively in the UK overall sales charts, with White becoming the second fastest-selling DS game ever in the UK after Professor Layton and Pandora's Box, selling 13,000 more copies than Black. Combined, their sales became Nintendo's third biggest ever launch in the UK, behind Wii Fit and Mario Kart Wii, and the biggest opening weekend ever for a pair of Pok\u00e9mon titles. In the US, Black and White sold more than 1.08 million copies on day one, breaking the previous day-one record held by predecessors Diamond and Pearl of 780,000 copies. According to the NPD Group, Nintendo sold 1.3 million units of White and 1.1 million units of Black in March 2011, making them the #1 and #2 top selling games in the US for the month. In April 2011, Nintendo's financial earnings report confirmed that Pok\u00e9mon Black and White had sold 11.5 million copies worldwide, making them the highest selling DS games for Nintendo in the 2010\u201311 financial year, and third overall, behind only the Wii games, Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort. As of September 2017, the games' combined sales have reached 15.64 million. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Category:2010 video games Category:Game Freak games Category:Japanese role-playing video games Category:Multiplayer and single- player video games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Nintendo DS-only games Category:Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection games Black and White Category:Role-playing video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games featuring protagonists of selectable gender Category:Video games with alternate versions Category:Video games with downloadable content Category:Video games scored by Junichi Masuda ",
