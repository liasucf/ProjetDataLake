    "text": "Jordan Jones (born 24 October 1994) is a Northern Irish professional footballer who plays for Scottish Premiership club Rangers as a winger. Jones has previously played for Middlesbrough, Hartlepool United, Cambridge United and Kilmarnock. He has played for the Northern Ireland national under-19 football team, and made his debut for the Northern Ireland senior squad in 2017. ==Club career== Jones started as a youth player with his home-town club Middlesbrough. He made one appearance for the Middlesbrough first team, in a 2012\u201313 FA Cup tie against Hastings United. Jones was loaned to Hartlepool United in February 2015 and Cambridge United in November 2015. He was released by Middlesbrough at the end of the 2015\u201316 season. Jones signed for Scottish Premiership club Kilmarnock in June 2016. In January 2018, Kilmarnock turned down an offer from Rangers to buy Jones for a reported \u00a3350,000 transfer fee. However, in January 2019 he signed a pre-contract agreement to join Rangers at the end of the 2018\u201319 season, and immediately tweeted a message expressing his delight at the \"dream move\" to the Glasgow club, which annoyed many Kilmarnock supporters as he would still be representing their team for several months, and only a point separated his current and future employers at the top of the league table. Jones later admitted he had been \"over-excited\" in sending the message, while Killie manager Steve Clarke defended the player and confirmed he would have no hesitation in playing him while he remained with the Ayrshire club. That backing was rewarded when Jones scored the winning goal in the next league fixture at Rugby Park, against Rangers; the 2\u20131 result boosted Kilmarnock's title hopes while denting those of the Gers. ===Rangers=== In June 2019 he said he wanted to be a first-team player at Rangers. He made his competitive debut for the club on 9 July 2019 in a 4\u20130 win over St Joseph's of Gibraltar in the 2019\u201320 UEFA Europa League.St Joseph's 0-4 Rangers: Steven Gerrard's team win Europa League qualifier, BBC Sport, 9 July 2019 Jones scored his first Rangers goal on 27 September 2020 against Motherwell, the second in a 5-1 win for Rangers at Fir Park. ==International career== Though born in England, Jones is able to represent Northern Ireland through his Northern Irish father. Aged 17, he represented their U19 team but turned down an opportunity to be part of the U21 squad. In September 2017, he was called up to the senior Northern Ireland squad for 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Germany and Norway,but did not play in either game. He won his first senior cap for Northern Ireland in the 2018 World Cup Qualifying play-off second leg on 12 November 2017, coming on as a substitute, replacing Jamie Ward. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center;\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|National Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Middlesbrough |2012\u201313 |Championship |0||0||1||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||1||0 |- |2013\u201314 |Championship |0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||0||0 |- |2014\u201315 |Championship |0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014|||0||0 |- |2015\u201316 |Championship |0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||0||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !0!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!colspan=2|\u2014!!1!!0 |- |Hartlepool United (loan) |2014\u201315 |League Two |11||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||11||0 |- |Cambridge United (loan) |2015\u201316 |League Two |1||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||1||0 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Kilmarnock |2016\u201317 |Scottish Premiership |37||3||1||0||4||0||colspan=2|\u2014||42||3 |- |2017\u201318 |Scottish Premiership |32||4||4||0||5||0||colspan=2|\u2014||41||4 |- |2018\u201319 |Scottish Premiership |28||4||2||0||5||0||colspan=2|\u2014||35||4 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !97!!11!!7!!0!!14!!0!!colspan=2|\u2014!!118!!11 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Rangers |2019\u201320 |Scottish Premiership |7||0||1||0||1||0||6||0||15||0 |- |2020\u201321 |Scottish Premiership |2||1||0||0||0||0||1||0||3||1 |- !colspan=2|Total !9!!1!!1!!0!!1!!0!!7!!0!!18!!1 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !118!!12!!9!!0!!15!!0!!7!!0!!149!!12 |} ===International=== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center;\" |+ Appearances and goals by national team and year |- !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals |- | rowspan=\"4\"|Northern Ireland |2017||1||0 |- |2018||4||0 |- |2019||4||0 |- |2020||2||0 |- !colspan=2|Total!!11!!0 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:1994 births Category:Footballers from Middlesbrough Category:Association footballers from Northern Ireland Category:Northern Ireland international footballers Category:Northern Ireland youth international footballers Category:English footballers Category:English people of Northern Ireland descent Category:Middlesbrough F.C. players Category:Hartlepool United F.C. players Category:Cambridge United F.C. players Category:Kilmarnock F.C. players Category:Rangers F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Scottish Professional Football League players Category:Association football wingers ",
