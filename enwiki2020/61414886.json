    "text": "Argo Wilis is an executive class train operated by PT Kereta Api Indonesia between Surabaya and Jakarta in Java, Indonesia. The train covers 865 kilometers in 17 hours with stoppage at Bandung, Cipeundeuy, Tasikmalaya, Banjar, Kroya, Kutoarjo, Yogyakarta, Solo Balapan, Madiun, and Jombang. This train runs in the morning from Gambir to Surabaya Gubeng or vice versa, and arrives at the destination at night. In the journey Gambir to Surabaya, passengers can enjoy the beautiful panorama of the eastern part of Parahyangan mountainous region. ==Etymology== The word Argo is used as a brand name of superior executive train services, while the word Wilis is taken from the name of Mount Wilis which has an altitude of 2,169 meters above sea level and is a long mountainous level with its highest peak in the Bajulan, Nganjuk, East Java. The train service was inaugurated on November 8, 1998. Since December 1, 2019 Argo Willis extended to Jakarta (Gambir station) via Cikampek-Padalarang line, and Argo Wilis added stops station at Jatinegara (only from Surabaya), & Cimahi. ==Facilities== The train consists of 7-9 executive passenger coach, 1 dining car, and 1 power carriage. The train has capacity for 350-400 passengers. The train has received the latest series from INKA since its launch in 1998. However, because some of the 1998 executive freight trains were also allocated to the Argo Dwipangga, some 1995 executive trains owned by KA Argo Gede were often used especially if the train needs a long series. As of June 2018, Argo Wilis used trains that varied between Argo executive trains made in 1995, 1996, 1998 and 2002, and other trains, and often exchanged trains with Argo Parahyangan. Since June 8, 2018, KA Argo Wilis has officially used the latest executive train which has a 2018 stainless steel body made by PT INKA Madiun, complete with a new train and generator train. The train uses CC206 locomotive. Previously used locomotive were CC203, CC201, and CC204. == See also == * Kereta Api Indonesia * Rail transport in Indonesia * List of named passenger trains of Indonesia ==References== == External links == * Category:Passenger rail transport in Indonesia Category:Rail transport in Indonesia Category:Surabaya Category:Bandung ",
