    "text": "The University of Sydney Design Lab, formerly the Key Centre of Design Computing and Cognition, is a teaching and research centre of the University's School of Architecture, Design and Planning, established in 1968. The aim of the centre is to apply human-centred design to products, services and systems. which was founded in 1968 by John Gero https://trove.nla.gov.au/people/617488?q=john+gero&c;=people (its Foundation Director) to research computers in design as a way of modeling and understanding designing. In 2007, after the departure of its co-directors John Gero and Mary Lou Maher https://trove.nla.gov.au/people/1156232?q=mary+lou+maher&c;=people, it changed its name to the Design Lab. During the intervening years its ambit grew to embrace teaching. The KCDC\u2019s research is founded on the use of a scientific approach to the development of models, theories and methods to understand designs and designing. Gero, J. S. (1970).
