    "text": "The South Region of Brazil (; ) is one of the five regions of Brazil. It includes the states of Paran\u00e1, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul and covers , being the smallest portion of the country, occupying only about 6.76% of the territory of Brazil. Its whole area is smaller than that of the state of Minas Gerais, in Southeast Brazil, for example. It is a great tourist, economic and cultural pole. It borders Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay, as well as the Centre-West and Southeast regions, and the Atlantic Ocean. The region is considered the safest in Brazil to visit, having a lower crime rate than other regions in the country. ==History== ===Pre-Columbian history=== S\u00e3o Miguel das Miss\u00f5es, where Jesuits lived with local Indians. By the time the first European explorers arrived, all parts of the territory were inhabited by semi- nomadic hunter-gatherer Indian tribes. They subsisted on a combination of hunting, fishing, and gathering. ===Portuguese colonization=== European colonization in Southern Brazil started with the arrival of Portuguese and Spanish Jesuit missionaries. They lived among the Indians and converted them to Catholicism. Colonists from S\u00e3o Paulo (Bandeirantes) arrived in the same period.RS VIRTUAL - O Rio Grande do Sul na Internet - Hist\u00f3ria - Miss\u00f5es - Como foi o surgimento dos Sete Povos das Miss\u00f5es For decades, the Portuguese and Spanish crowns disputed over this region. Due to this conflict, the King of Portugal encouraged the immigration of settlers from the Azores Islands to Southern Brazil, in an attempt to build up a Portuguese population. Between 1748 and 1756, six thousand Azoreans arrived. They composed over half of the population of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina by the late 18th century.\"Imigrantes: A\u00e7orianos\" ===German settlement=== German settlement in Southern Brazil (pink), in 1905 Pomerode, A Pomeranian-German colony in Santa Catarina The first German immigrants came to Brazil soon after it gained independence in 1822 from Portugal. They were recruited to work as small farmers because there were many land holdings without sufficient workers. To attract the immigrants, the Brazilian government had promised them large tracts where they could settle with their families and colonize the region. The first immigrants arrived in 1824, settling in the city of Sao Leopoldo. Over the next four decades, another 27,256 Germans were brought to Rio Grande do Sul to work as smallholders in the country.Germans By 1904, it is estimated that 50,000 Germans had settled in this state. In Santa Catarina, most German immigrants were not brought by the Brazilian government but by private groups that promoted the immigration of Europeans to the Americas, such as the Hamburg Colonization Society. These groups created rural communities or colonies for immigrants, many of which developed into large cities, such as Blumenau and Joinville, the largest city in Santa Catarina. Considerable numbers of immigrants from Germany arrived at Paran\u00e1 during the civil war, most of them coming from Santa Catarina; others were Volga Germans from Russia. ===Ragamuffin War=== The Ragamuffin War was a Republican uprising that began in Southern Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina) in 1835. The rebels, led by generals Bento Gon\u00e7alves da Silva and Ant\u00f4nio de Souza Netto with the support of the Italian warrior Giuseppe Garibaldi, surrendered to imperial forces in 1845. This conflict occurred because in Rio Grande do Sul, the state's main product, the charque (dried and salted beef), suffered stiff competition from charque from Uruguay and Argentina. The imports had free access to the Brazilian market while ga\u00fachos had to pay high taxes to sell their product inside Brazil. The Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi joined the rebels in 1839. With his help the revolution spread through Santa Catarina, in the northern border of Rio Grande do Sul. After many conflicts, in 1845 peace negotiations ended the war. ===Italian settlement=== Italian immigrants started arriving in Brazil in 1875. They were mostly peasants from the Veneto in Northern Italy (but also from Trentino and Lombardia) attracted to Southern Brazil for economic opportunities and the chance to acquire their own lands. Most of the immigrants worked as small farmers, mainly cultivating grapes in the Serra Ga\u00facha. Italian immigration to the region lasted until 1914, with a total of 100,000 Italians settling in Rio Grande do Sul in this period, and many others in Santa Catarina and Paran\u00e1.Italians In 1898, there were a total of 300,000 people of Italian origin in Rio Grande do Sul; 50,000 in Santa Catarina; and 30,000 in Paran\u00e1. Today their Southern Brazilian descendants number 9.7 million and comprise 35.9% of Southern Brazil's population.:pt:Imigra\u00e7\u00e3o italiana no Brasil#Rio Grande do Sul ==Demographics== As noted, the region received numerous European immigrants during the 19th century, who have had a large influence on its demography and culture.

It snows in the mountain ranges. ==Characteristics== The region is highly urbanized (82%) and many cities are famous for their urban planning, like Curitiba and Maring\u00e1, both in Paran\u00e1 State. It has a relatively high standard of living, with the highest Human Development Index of Brazil, 0.859 (2007), and the second highest per capita income of the country, $13.396, behind only the Southeast Region. The region also has a 98.3% literacy rate. ==Languages== Portuguese, the official language of Brazil, is spoken by the entire population. In the south countryside, dialects of German or Italian origins are also spoken. The predominant dialects are Hunsr\u00fcckisch and Venetian (or Talian).

In the region around Ponta Grossa there are also some Dutch speakers. There are Polish language and Ukrainian language speakers in Paran\u00e1 as well. Indigenous languages still spoken in some villages include Guarani and Kaingang. ==Palaeontological tourism== Rio Grande do Sul has a great potential for palaeontological tourism, with many paleontological sites and museums in Paleorrota. There is a large area in the center of the state that belongs to the Triassic. Here lived Rhynchosaur, thecodonts, exaeretodons, Staurikosaurus, Guaibasaurus, Saturnalia tupiniquim, Sacisaurus, Unaysaurus and many others. ==See also== *Immigration to Brazil *German Brazilian *Italian Brazilian *Polish Brazilian *Spanish immigration to Brazil *Ukrainian Brazilian *Ga\u00facho *Centro-Sul ==References== ==External links== * P\u00e1tria Sulista, official website Category:Regions of Brazil Category:Proposed countries ",
