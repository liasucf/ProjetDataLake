    "text": "was one of Japan's first filmmakers. He worked for the photographer Shir\u014d Asano and the Konishi Camera shop, the first in Japan to import a motion picture camera. Along with Kanzo Shirai, he made the earliest films in Japan, mostly of geisha, Ginza, and selections of scenes from popular plays. His first exhibition was at the Tokyo Kabuki-za in 1899. After that he focused mainly on Kabuki plays. In 1898, before starting his work with Shirai, he shot five documentary films of street scenes in Tokyo for the Lumi\u00e8re Company, numbers 981\u2013985 in the Lumi\u00e8re catalogue. It appears negatives for these films still exist and one print of #985. If this is true, it would make the documentary work the oldest extant films by a Japanese filmmaker, though not the first films shot in Japan. ==Early works== * Armed Robber: Shimizu Sakakichi (not surviving) * Momijigari starring Ichikawa Danj\u016br\u014d IX * Ninjin Dojo (not surviving) ==External links== Category:1850 births Category:1929 deaths Category:Japanese film directors ",
