The Security Council reaffirmed its commitment of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Macedonia and reiterated concern about any developments that could threaten its stability. In this regard, the mandate of UNPREDEP was extended until 30 May 1996 and urged it to continue co-operation with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Requests from the Secretary-General to provide assistance to UNPREDEP were asked to be considered favourably. By 31 January 1996, the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was requested to report to the Council concerning any developments affecting the mandate of UNPREDEP. ==See also== * Bosnian War * Breakup of Yugoslavia * Croatian War of Independence * List of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1001 to 1100 (1995\u20131997) * Yugoslav Wars ==References== ==External links== * *Text of the Resolution at undocs.org 1027 1027 Category:1995 in Yugoslavia Category:1995 in the Republic of Macedonia 1027 Category:November 1995 events ",
