He also knows how to play the cello. ==Career== === Drag === Thorgy Thor moved to Brooklyn in 2006 and considers herself a Brooklyn queen. She has said Brooklyn's drag style has contributed to her aesthetic. Galligan's first drag performance was as Frank N. Furter from The Rocky Horror Show. He was also Marvel Ann in the theater version of Psycho Beach Party. His original drag name was Shananigans; as Thorgy Thor she won the LEGEND award at the 2014 Brooklyn Nightlife Awards. Having auditioned for Drag Race since season one, Galligan, as Thorgy Thor, was announced to be competing on the eighth season of RuPaul's Drag Race on February 1, 2016. He placed sixth out of twelve overall, losing to Chi Chi Devayne in the seventh episode. Thorgy was brought back for the third season of RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars, revealed on October 20, 2017. Thorgy got eliminated in ninth place by season 2 and 3 queen Shangela. Thorgy's response to being eliminated, \"Oh Jesus, gross\", was turned into a three-second video clip and became a viral meme. During the show's finale, Thorgy Thor was the only queen to vote for Shangela, despite a previously rocky relationship. Thorgy Thor appears with BeBe Zahara Benet, Jujubee and Alexis Michelle in the TLC special Drag Me Down the Aisle, which aired on March 9, 2019. The special was expanded into a full series titled Dragnificent! which premiered on April 19, 2020. === Music === Thorgy Thor contributed to the albums Christmas Queens 2 (2016) and Christmas Queens 3 (2017).
