The band have received critical acclaim such as a nomination for Best British Newcomer at the 2015 Relentless Kerrang! Awards, voted as a 2015 Best British Newcomer by Rock Sound, and named one of 12 bands you need to know for January 2016 by Alternative Press. ==Significant tours and festival appearances== === 2019 === * From The Grave To The Stage tour - co-headline tour with Griever - 10\u201327 October === 2018 === * Ashestoangels w/Fail The Enemy & Kill The Silence tour - 18\u201325 August ===2016=== *Fort Hope \u2013 22\u201329 October *Butserfest \u2013 10 September *Hawthorne Heights - 9\u201319 August *Download Festival \u2013 12 June *Camden Rocks Festival \u2013 4 June *Aiden (The Last Sunrise Tour UK) - 16\u201329 January ===2015=== *Aiden (The Last Sunrise Tour US Leg) \u2013 26 October \u2013 5 November *First US Tour dates with Black Veil Brides \u2013 22\u201323 October \u2013 California *British Horror Story tour \u2013 17\u201328 July *Whitby Goth Weekend \u2013 23\u201326 April *Takedown Festival \u2013 7 March === 2014 === The Punishment Tour w/William Control - 21\u201328 April == Band members == * Adam Crilly (aka Crilly Ashes) - Lead vocals, synthesizers, piano * Adam Falkor - Lead & rhythm guitars, backing vocals * Josh Jones - Lead, Rhythm Guitars and harmony guitars, backing vocals - Front man of solo side project Misery Merchant (formerly Coast To Ghost) * Chris Kiddier - Bass, gang vocals, synthesizers and creator of the Ashestoangels Filterpress remixes available on Spotify * Nikki Kontinen - Synthesizers, keyboards, programmed drums, piano, backing vocals - Bass player for the band Bad Pollyanna * Jarlath McCaughery - Drums, gang vocals - formerly of As Sirens Fall ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !scope=\"col\" style=\"width:14em\"|Title !scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20em\"|Album details !scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em\"|Ref. |- !scope=\"row\"|A Trauma Shared | *Released: 13 April 2018 *Sound Recording Copyright: Horror Cult Inc. | |- !scope=\"row\"|How To Bleed | *Released: 18 April 2016 *Sound Recording Copyright: Horror Cult Inc. | |- !scope=\"row\"|Horror Cult | *Released: 31 October 2014 *Sound Recording Copyright: Ashestoangels | |- !scope=\"row\"|With Tape And Needles | *Released: 26 August 2013 *Sound Recording Copyright: Dust Devil Sounds | |- !scope=\"row\"|Most Beautiful Things Are Dead | *Released: 12 February 2010 *Sound Recording Copyright: Ashestoangels | |} ===Extended Plays=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !scope=\"col\" style=\"width:14em\"|Title !scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20em\"|Album details !scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em\"|Ref. |- !scope=\"row\"|The Unreliable Narrator | *Released: 13 December 2016 *Sound Recording Copyright: Ashestoangels | |- !scope=\"row\"|The Winter Split (with As Sirens Fall) | *Released: 9 December 2016 *Sound Recording Copyright: As Sirens Fall & Ashestoangels | |- !scope=\"row\"|The Wake | *Released: 20 April 2015 *Sound Recording Copyright: Horror Cult Inc. | |} ==Influences and work with William Control== The band cite William Control and Aiden as shared influences among all members. They recorded albums Horror Cult (2014) and How To Bleed (2016) with Control, the former at Southampton studio The Ranch, for which they flew the producer to the UK with money raised via a fan-supported Indiegogo campaign; and the latter at Control's own Hell's Half Acre studios in Seattle. They would also go on to support Aiden's farewell tours in the US (2015) and UK (2016). The name \"Ashestoangels\" is derived from Ashes to Ashes.. Vocalist Adam Crilly says that David Bowie was among his earliest musical influences. == References == == External links == * Category:Musical groups established in 2009 Category:English rock music groups Category:Horror punk groups ",
