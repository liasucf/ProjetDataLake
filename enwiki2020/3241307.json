    "text": "The Constitutional Law PAC is a political action committee formed in the state of Washington to help elect candidates to the Washington State Supreme Court and Washington State Court of Appeals. The Constitutional Law PAC has a center-right orientation. Conservatives have expressed concerns that the group's leadership is too liberal, while liberals have criticized the committee as a conservative attempt to influence judicial elections. ==Candidate Evaluation Committee== The Candidate Evaluation Committee was chaired by Former King County Prosecutor Christopher T. Bayley a moderate Republican. Members of the committee were Seattle labor attorney Jerry Rubin of the law firm Stoel Rives (Democrat), Chehalis attorney Renee\u2019 Remund of the firm Vander Stoep, Remund and Blinks (Republican) and Senior Pierce County Deputy Prosecutor Phil Sorenson (Democrat). In 2006 the committee formed a bi- partisan Candidate Evaluation Committee to issue rating for appellate level judicial candidates in Washington State. The committee issued two ratings for each candidate: \"Judicial Qualifications\" and \"Judicial Philosophy\". ===Judicial Qualifications=== The Judicial Qualifications rating relied on similar criteria to those used by the King County Bar Association and other bar associations. The possible ratings were \u201cVery Well Qualified\u201d, \u201cWell Qualified\u201d, \u201cQualified\u201d and \u201cUnqualified\u201d. ===Judicial Philosophy=== The committee based its \"Judicial Philosophy\" rating reflects on their understanding of a candidate\u2019s \u201cdeference to the law, constitution and established legal precedent.\u201d An \u201cA\u201d was used to indicate that the candidate showed complete deference to the law, constitution and established legal precedent. A \u201cB\u201d was awarded for significant deference, a \u201cC\u201d for partial deference, a \u201cD\u201d for insufficient deference and an \u201cF\u201d for little or no deference. ===Ratings=== The committee rated four incumbent judges as \u201cVery Well Qualified\u201d, Chief Justice Gerry L. Alexander, Judge Ronald E. Cox of the Court of Appeals, Judge Marlin Appelwick of the Court of Appeals, and Judge David Armstrong of the Court of Appeals. State Senator Stephen Johnson was the only non-incumbent rated Very Well Qualified. Two candidates were rated \u201cUnqualified\u201d, conservative Supreme Court challenger Jeanette Burrage and Joel M. Penoyar who was appointed to the Court of Appeals in 2005. == Important names == *Chairman of the Board: Former Republican Senator Slade Gorton *Board Members: Christopher T. Bayley, Anthony Sternola, Marianne Jones and Alex Hays *Executive Director: Alex Hays *Chairman, Candidate Evaluation Committee: Christopher T.
