    "text": "UFC 191: Johnson vs. Dodson 2 was a mixed martial arts event held on September 5, 2015, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. ==Background== Initially, a UFC Light Heavyweight Championship bout between current champion Daniel Cormier and top contender Alexander Gustafsson was linked as a possible event headliner. Although never officially announced by the UFC, the bout between Cormier and Gustafsson would not take place at this event and would instead be postponed and moved to UFC 192. During the live Fox Sports 1 broadcast of UFC Fight Night: Mir vs. Duffee, it was confirmed that a UFC Flyweight Championship bout between current champion Demetrious Johnson and top contender John Dodson would headline the event. Their first fight at UFC on Fox: Johnson vs. Dodson ended in a unanimous decision victory for Johnson. The co-main event featured a heavyweight bout between former UFC Heavyweight champions Andrei Arlovski and Frank Mir. Anthony Johnson was originally expected to face Jan B\u0142achowicz on the card. However, Johnson was pulled from the bout on July 30 in favor of a fight with Jimi Manuwa at the event. In turn, B\u0142achowicz faced The Ultimate Fighter 19 light heavyweight winner Corey Anderson. Raquel Pennington was initially expected to face Leslie Smith at UFC 192. However, Smith was forced to pull out of the event due to injury. Subsequently, Pennington was pulled from the card entirely in favor of a bout with former title challenger Liz Carmouche at this event. In turn, Carmouche pulled out of the fight just days after being added, citing injury and was replaced by J\u00e9ssica Andrade. This fight was a rematch, as Andrade beat Pennington via split decision at UFC 171. Andre Fili was expected to face Clay Collard at the event. However, less than one week after the bout was announced, Fili was forced out of the bout with an injury and was replaced by Tiago Trator. ==Results== ==Reported payout== The following is the reported payout to the fighters as reported to the Nevada State Athletic Commission.
