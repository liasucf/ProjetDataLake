    "text": "Craig Barr (born 29 March 1987) is a Scottish footballer who plays as a defender for Cowdenbeath. Barr has previously played for Gretna, Queen of the South, Livingston, Airdrieonians, Raith Rovers and Dumbarton, as well as Swedish club \u00d6stersunds FK. ==Career== ===Early years=== Born in Edinburgh, Barr moved south as a 16-year-old to join Blackburn Rovers and spent three years with the Lancashire club winning the FA Premier Academy League in 2004\u201305. ===Gretna=== Barr played in the early part of his career with Gretna signing for the club when they were bankrolled by Brooks Mileson. He was part of the squad who won the Scottish Football League First Division in the 2006\u201307 season which earned them promotion into the SPL. In 47 league appearances for Gretna, Barr scored five goals. Mileson pulled the plug on the club's cashflow when his health deteriorated. The club thus became financially stricken and went into administration. Administrators for Gretna laid off their last 40 staff including Barr on 19 May 2008. ===Queen of the South=== Barr signed a two-year contract with Dumfries-based First Division side Queen of the South on 26 June 2008. Just after signing, Barr said \"I'm really looking forward to the move. Queens are coming off the back of a fantastic season and I'm excited at the prospect of playing for the Scottish Cup finalists. I know big Neilly MacFarlane, Jamie McQuilken and 'Tosher' from my time at Gretna and also have a lot of respect for ex-Queens player, big Derek Townsley, who I also know well\". After playing over thirty games in his first season with the club, Barr suffered a season-ending injury on his knee during the pre-season of 2009\u201310. He had two operations on this injury, with the major one being a complete cruciate reconstruction. As Queens refused to pay for the operation, Barr took it upon himself to fund it. Due to this matter, he then spent the last six months of his contract doing his own rehab away from the club. Barr was among the players announced as released by the club at the end of the 2009\u201310 season.\"Retained List\", www.qosfc.com ===Livingston=== Barr signed for Livingston in August 2010.
