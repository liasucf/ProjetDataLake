Millions throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia have seen his blogart, environmental sculptures, multi-media installations, telecommunications art events, and exhibitions of paintings and prints that explore digital technologies and global systems. The leading American art magazine, ARTnews, praised his \"LightsOROT: Spiritual Dimensions of the Electronic Age\" exhibition created in collaboration with Otto Piene at MIT Center for Advanced Visual Studies for Yeshiva University Museum in New York by writing: \"Rarely is an exhibition as visually engaging and intellectually challenging.\" Alexenberg's papers, exhibition catalogs, and art project documents are in the collection of the Archives of American Art of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC.
