His notable contributions included discovering a periodic minimal surface in the space \\mathbb{R}^3; stating the famous Catalan's conjecture, which was eventually proved in 2002; and, introducing the Catalan numbers to solve a combinatorial problem. == Biography == Catalan was born in Bruges (now in Belgium, then under Dutch rule even though the Kingdom of the Netherlands had not yet been formally instituted), the only child of a French jeweller by the name of Joseph Catalan, in 1814. In 1825, he traveled to Paris and learned mathematics at \u00c9cole Polytechnique, where he met Joseph Liouville (1833). In December 1834 he was expelled along with most of the students in his year for political reasons;November 1834 he resumed his studies in January 1835, graduated that summer, and went on to teach at Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne. Catalan came back to the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, and, with the help of Liouville, obtained his degree in mathematics in 1841. He went on to Charlemagne College to teach descriptive geometry. Though he was politically active and strongly left-wing, leading him to participate in the 1848 Revolution, he had an animated career and also sat in the France's Chamber of Deputies. Later, in 1849, Catalan was visited at his home by the French Police, searching for illicit teaching material; however, none was found. The University of Li\u00e8ge appointed him chair of analysis in 1865. In 1879, still in Belgium, he became journal editor where he published as a foot note Paul-Jean Busschop's theory after refusing it in 1873 - letting Busschop know that it was too empirical. In 1883, he worked for the Belgian Academy of Science in the field of number theory. He died in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium where he had received a chair. == Work == He worked on continued fractions, descriptive geometry, number theory and combinatorics. He gave his name to a unique surface (periodic minimal surface in the space \\mathbb{R}^3) that he discovered in 1855. Before that, he had stated the famous Catalan's conjecture, which was published in 1844 and was eventually proved in 2002, by the Romanian mathematician Preda Mih\u0103ilescu. He introduced the Catalan numbers to solve a combinatorial problem. ==Selected publications== *Th\u00e9or\u00e8mes et Probl\u00e8mes G\u00e9om\u00e9trie \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire, Brussels, 2nd edition 1852, 6th edition 1879 *\u00c9l\u00e9ments de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie, 1843, 2nd printing 1847 *Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie descriptive, 2 volumes 1850, 1852, 3rd edition 1867/1868, 5th edition 1881 *Nouveau manuel des aspirants au baccalaur\u00e9at \u00e8s sciences, 1852 (12 editions published) *Solutions des probl\u00e8mes de math\u00e9matique et de physique donn\u00e9s \u00e0 la Sorbonne dans les compositions du baccalaur\u00e9at \u00e8s sciences, 1855/56 *Manuel des candidats \u00e0 l'\u00c9cole Polytechnique, 2 volumes, 1857-58 *Notions d'astronomie, 1860 (6 editions published) *Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire des s\u00e9ries, 1860 *Histoire d'un concours, 1865, 2nd edition 1867 *Cours d'analyse de l'universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge, 1870, 2nd edition 1880 *Int\u00e9grales eul\u00e9riennes ou elliptiques, 1892 == See also == *Catalan solid *Cassini and Catalan identities for Fibonacci numbers *Catalan's constant *Catalan number *Catalan\u2013Mersenne number/Catalan's Mersenne conjecture *Catalan surface *Catalan's conjecture *Catalan's minimal surface ==References== == External links == * * * Catalan Category:1814 births Category:1894 deaths Category:People from Bruges Category:Belgian scientists Category:Belgian academics Category:Belgian mathematicians Category:Corresponding Members of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences Category:19th-century mathematicians Category:Combinatorialists Category:Number theorists Category:19th-century French mathematicians ",
