    "text": "Michael Lionel \"Mike\" Howell (born July 5, 1943 in West Monroe, Louisiana) is a former American football defensive back who played with the National Football League's Cleveland Browns and the Miami Dolphins. Howell was drafted by the Browns in the eighth round of the 1965 NFL Draft out of Grambling State.Palmer, Pete; Pullis, Ken; Lahman, Sean; Silverman, Matthew; Gillette, Gary (Eds.). The ESPN Pro Football Encyclopedia: First Edition, p. 1402. Sterling Publishing, 2006. . A college quarterback,Peticca, Mike. \"Cleveland Browns' 100 best all-time players: No. 89 -- Mike Howell (video)\". Cleveland Plain Dealer, August 16, 2012. Retrieved on May 11, 2013. Howell converted to defensive back in the NFL. Howell felt he had no chance playing quarterback in the NFL due to his race. At the time African-Americans were stereotyped as not being able to successfully play the position. \"I know I'm not going into the NFL as a black quarterback,\" is what Howell told his coach, the legendary Eddie Robinson. So, he changed to cornerback, winning a starting job in 1966, and moved to free safety in 1968. Howell did not miss a league game during his career in Cleveland, and intercepted 27 passes during his NFL career.Neft, David S. & Cohen, Richard M. The Football Encyclopedia: The Complete History of Professional NFL Football from 1892 to the Present, p. 478. St. Martin's Press, 1991. . In 2012, the Cleveland Plain Dealer selected Howell as one of the 100 best players in Browns history. ==References== Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:People from West Monroe, Louisiana Category:American football cornerbacks Category:American football safeties Category:Cleveland Browns players Category:Miami Dolphins players Category:Grambling State Tigers football players ",
