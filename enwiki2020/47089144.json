    "text": "In algebraic geometry, a closed immersion i: X \\hookrightarrow Y of schemes is a regular embedding of codimension r if each point x in X has an open affine neighborhood U in Y such that the ideal of X \\cap U is generated by a regular sequence of length r. A regular embedding of codimension one is precisely an effective Cartier divisor. == Examples and usage == For example, if X and Y are smooth over a scheme S and if i is an S-morphism, then i is a regular embedding. In particular, every section of a smooth morphism is a regular embedding. If \\operatorname{Spec}B is regularly embedded into a regular scheme, then B is a complete intersection ring. The notion is used, for instance, in an essential way in Fulton's approach to intersection theory. The important fact is that when i is a regular embedding, if I is the ideal sheaf of X in Y, then the normal sheaf, the dual of I/I^2, is locally free (thus a vector bundle) and the natural map \\operatorname{Sym}(I/I^2) \\to \\oplus_0^\\infty I^n/I^{n+1} is an isomorphism: the normal cone \\operatorname{Spec}(\\oplus_0^\\infty I^n/I^{n+1}) coincides with the normal bundle. A morphism of finite type f:X \\to Y is called a (local) complete intersection morphism if each point x in X has an open affine neighborhood U so that f |U factors as U \\overset{j}\\to V \\overset{g}\\to Y where j is a regular embedding and g is smooth. For example, if f is a morphism between smooth varieties, then f factors as X \\to X \\times Y \\to Y where the first map is the graph morphism and so is a complete intersection morphism. === Non Examples === One non-example is a scheme which isn't equidimensional. For example, the scheme : X = \\text{Spec}\\left( \\frac{\\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]}{(xz,yz)}\\right) is the union of \\mathbb{A}^2 and \\mathbb{A}^1. Then, the embedding X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{A}^3 isn't regular since taking any non-origin point on the z-axis is of dimension 1 while any non-origin point on the xy-plane is of dimension 2. == Virtual tangent bundle == Let f: X \\to Y be a local-complete-intersection morphism that admits a global factorization: it is a composition X \\overset{i}\\hookrightarrow P \\overset{p}\\to Y where i is a regular embedding and p a smooth morphism. Then the virtual tangent bundle is an element of the Grothendieck group of vector bundles on X given as: :T_f = [i^* T_{P/Y}] - [N_{X/P}]. The notion is used for instance in the Riemann\u2013Roch-type theorem. == Non-noetherian case == SGA 6 Expo VII uses the following weakened form of the notion of a regular embedding, that agrees with the usual one for Noetherian schemes. First, given a projective module E over a commutative ring A, an A-linear map u: E \\to A is called Koszul-regular if the Koszul complex determined by it is acyclic in dimension > 0 (consequently, it is a resolution of the cokernel of u). NB: We follow the terminology of the Stacks project. Then a closed immersion X \\hookrightarrow Y is called Koszul-regular if the ideal sheaf determined by it is such that, locally, there are a finite free A-module E and a Koszul-regular surjection from E to the ideal sheaf. (This complication is because the discussion of a zero-divisor is tricky for Non-noetherian rings in that one cannot use the theory of associated primes.) == See also == *regular submanifold == Notes == == References == * *, section B.7 *E.
