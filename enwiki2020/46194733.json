    "text": "The 1965 British West Indies Championships was the sixth and final edition of the track and field competition between British colony nations in the Caribbean. It was held in Bridgetown, Barbados. The dissolution of the West Indies Federation, and the broader sports co-operation it had engendered, left the competition without the support to continue. A total of 28 events were contested, eighteen by men and ten by women. The men's half marathon, pole vault and relay races were all revived for this final edition, although the 3000 metres steeplechase was dropped. Jamaica was the most successful nation, taking seventeen of the titles on offer \u2013 it was Jamaica's fourth win at the competition and the only time a host nation did not top the medal table.British West Indies Championships.

On the women's side Carmen Smith retained her 100 metres title and Una Morris finished undefeated in the 400 metres. Joan Gordon won both the shot put and discus throw for a second time running, while Beverley Welsh was again victorious in the long jump.
