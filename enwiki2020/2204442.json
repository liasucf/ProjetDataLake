It is a vitreous monoclinic mineral, colored bright blue to green, often associated with malachite, azurite, olivenite, and clinoclase. It is quite soft, with a Mohs hardness of 2 - 2.5, and has a specific gravity of 2.9 - 3.0. Vugs in gossan lined with lustrous, blue-green liroconite blades and sparkly, dark blue clinoclase microcrystals from Wheal Gorland (size: 3.4 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm) It was first identified in 1825 in the tin and copper mines of Devon and Cornwall, England. Although it remains quite rare it has subsequently been identified in a variety of locations including France, Germany, Australia, New Jersey and California. The type locality for Liroconite is Wheal Gorland in St Day, Cornwall in the United Kingdom. It occurs as a secondary mineral in copper deposits in association with olivenite, chalcophyllite, clinoclase, cornwallite, strashimirite, malachite, cuprite and limonite. ==References== Category:Copper(II) minerals Category:Arsenate minerals Category:Monoclinic minerals ",
