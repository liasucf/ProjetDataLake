    "text": "Horae Canonicae is a series of poems by W. H. Auden written between 1949 and 1955. The title is a reference to the canonical hours of the Christian Church, as are the titles of the seven poems constituting the series: \"Prime\", \"Terce\", \"Sext\", \"Nones\", \"Vespers\", \"Compline\", and \"Lauds\". Each refers to a fixed time of the day for prayer. The canonical hours create a framework for the dramatization of Auden's religious position, which he described in a letter as \"very much the same as Reinhold [Neibuhr]'s, i.e. Augustinian, not Thomist (I would allow a little more place, perhaps, for the Via Negativa.) Liturgically, I am Anglo-Catholic...\". \"Prime\" and \"Nones\" were first published in Auden's collection Nones (1951). Horae Canonicae was published as a unity in Auden's The Shield of Achilles (1955). == See also == *Diurnal offices == Notes == Category:Poetry by W. H. Auden Category:1955 poems ",
