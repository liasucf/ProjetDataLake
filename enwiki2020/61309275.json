The Earl Carroll Vanities was a Broadway revue that Earl Carroll presented in the 1920s and early 1930s. Carroll and his show were sometimes controversial. ==Distinguishing qualities== In 1923, the Vanities joined the ranks of New York\u2019s other popular revues: The Greenwich Village Follies, George White's Scandals, and The Ziegfeld Follies. At a time when Florenz Ziegfeld was hailed as \u201cThe Great Glorifier of the American Girl,\u201d Carroll bragged that \u201cthe most beautiful girls in the world\u201d passed through the stage door of his theatre. As many as 108 women were onstage in Carroll's show at one time.\u201cCarroll\u2019s \u2018Vanities\u2019 Full of Vaudeville,\u201d New York Times, September 11, 1924, p. 23. Critics often insinuated that Carroll's performers were provocatively dressed.Atkinson, J. Brooks. \u201cThe Play,\u201d New York Times, August 25, 1926, p. 19. Carroll frequently sublimated public scrutiny into free publicity.Everett, William A., & Paul R. Laird. Historical Dictionary of the Broadway Musical, Second Edition. Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield, 2016. p. 239. Though Carroll boasted of presenting larger casts than his peers, his fare was frequently regarded as somewhat unsophisticated.Stempel, Larry. Showtime: A History of the Broadway Musical Theatre. New York: W. W. Norton & Co., 2010, p. 214. One critic in the New York Times described the show's comedy bits, which featured burlesque-styled dancers and minstrel-styled blackface comics,Atkinson, J. Brooks. \u201cThe Play,\u201d New York Times, August 25, 1926, p. 19. as \u201cThe same old stuff\u201d.\u201cCarroll\u2019s \u2018Vanities\u2019 Full of Vaudeville,\u201d New York Times, September 11, 1924, p. 23. One of Carroll\u2019s innovations was his \u201cliving curtain,\u201d which featured scantily-clad models in striking stage pictures.Green, Stanley. Broadway Musicals Show by Show. Milwaukee: Hal Leonard Books, 1985, p. 76. This wordless mise-en-sc\u00e8ne was similar to the \u201cballad ballet\u201d of The Greenwich Village Follies and the tableau vivant of The Ziegfeld Follies. ==Editions== The following chart shows the various editions of the revue:Internet Broadway Database {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ EARL CARROLL'S VANITIES |- !

In 1924, Sophie Tucker was Carroll's featured \u201cchirper.\u201d\u201cCarroll\u2019s \u2018Vanities\u2019 Full of Vaudeville,\u201d New York Times, September 11, 1924, p. 23. W. C. Fields was credited as both a comic and an author in the 1928 show. Jack Benny made his Broadway debut in the 1930 edition. Burton Lane, who would later compose several other Broadway scores, contributed music to the 1931 edition. In 1932, long before he wrote \u201cOver the Rainbow,\u201d Harold Arlen composed \u201cI Gotta Right to Sing the Blues\u201d for Carroll.Bordman, Gerald. American Musical Theatre: A Chronicle. New York: Oxford University Press, 1978, p. 479. The scenery and costumes that appeared in that number (and throughout the evening) brought a young Vincente Minnelli recognition.Bordman, Gerald. American Musical Theatre: A Chronicle. New York: Oxford University Press, 1978, p. 479. Also in that year, the comic Milton BerleSmith, Bill. The Vaudevillians. New York: Macmillan, 1976, p. 73. played a number of eccentric characters, as he would frequently do in his television show three decades later. Of course, not all of the revue's contributors went on to become household names; lesser-known alumni included Joe Cook, Lillian Roth, Ted Healy, David Chasen,\u201cHarbor Police Hunt for Missing Actors,\u201d New York Times, August 11, 1925, p. 23. George Moran, Charles Mack, Peggy Hopkins Joyce, Kathryn Reed Altman, Faith Bacon, Will Mahoney, Frank MitchellSmith, Bill. The Vaudevillians. New York: Macmillan, 1976, p. 110 Yvette Rugel, and Beryl Wallace. ==Actors\u2019 equity== Propriety wasn\u2019t the only scandal that plagued the production. Before the first edition ever opened, actors were under the impression that they had auditioned for a vaudeville-type show\u2014free from the purview of Actors\u2019 Equity. When they realized that they were rehearsing a revue, they demanded that Carroll either hire an all-Equity cast or join the Producing Managers' Association. Carroll fired the Equity members. In retaliation, around 150 Equity members refused employment with Carroll.\u201cEquity Retaliates on Earl Carroll,\u201d New York Times, June 11, 1923, p. 16. ==Variations and legacy== By the mid-1920s, audiences were starting to crave storylines; Carroll took notice. With Murder at the Vanities (1933), he successfully inserted a revue into a book musical. The first edition of The Earl Carroll\u2019s Sketch Book opened in 1929, but patrons surmised that it was merely the Vanities under a different guise. Carroll\u2019s last attempt to re- stage his signature revue on Broadway closed after twenty-five performances.Bordman, Gerald. American Musical Theatre: A Chronicle. New York: Oxford University Press, 1978, p. 519. Bankruptcy prompted Carroll to take his operation to Los Angeles, where his spacious theatre drew appreciative crowds, especially among soldiers on leave during World War II. The new venue, with its table-and-chair seating arrangement, had the cabaret atmosphere he had once hoped to achieve in New York, notably with the fourth edition of the Vanities.\u201c\u2018Vanities,\u2019 Fourth Edition, Run Like a Night Club,\u201d New York Times, December 29, 1925, p. 20. In 1945, the Vanities inspired a musical film of the same title. Two other films inspired by Carroll's productions were Murder at the Vanities and The Earl Carroll Sketchbook. ==References== Category:Broadway musicals Category:Revues ",
