    "text": "Mihrdat IV (, Latinized as Mithridates), of the Chosroid Dynasty, was the king of Iberia (Kartli, eastern Georgia) from c. 409 to 411. He was the son of Varaz-Bakur II and the grandson (on his mother\u2019s side) of Trdat. The Georgian chronicles criticizes him for impiety and neglect of religious building, and informs us that he opposed both major regional powers, the Roman and Sassanid empires.Rapp, Stephen H.
