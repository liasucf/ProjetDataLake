Maiden wrote the original manuscript in the early 1980s, and it was published in an abridged form by Allen & Unwin in 1990. It was translated into German by dtv Verlagsgesellschaft as Ein Messer im Haus in 1994. Quemar Press published the novel digitally in an updated edition in 2016, and published it in a paperback edition in 2018, combining it with its unpublished sequel, Play With Knives: Two: Complicity. Play With Knives is the first book in Maiden's Play With Knives Quintet of novels. ==Plot== Play With Knives takes place in Sydney's Western Suburbs and focuses on Clare Collins, a young woman released from prison, after murdering her siblings at the age of nine. The narrator is George Jeffreys, her probation officer. As a serial killer begins targeting women, a complex relationship of survival develops between Clare and George.Maiden, Jennifer. Play With Knives. Allen & Unwin, 1990 ==Critical and Cultural Response== Play With Knives and its sequels have been a subject of Academic and cultural study and review. Play With Knives has been described as an \"impressive psycho-thriller\" by The Oxford Companion to Australian Literature.Andrews, B., Hooton, J., Wilde, W. The Oxford Companion to Australia Literature. Oxford University Press, 2002, p.504. Recently, it was depicted in the Sydney Morning Herald as 'One of the most chilling but underrated Australian novels of the early 1990s' by critic Peter Pierce.Pierce, Peter, \"Friendly Fire\", The Sydney Morning Herald (December 14, 2005). John Hanrahan, the Australian critic and author, wrote in Australian Book Review that its sequel, Play With Knives: Two: Complicity, 'explored power, manipulation, control, violence as sexual foreplay, and yet... [is] a novel that has the strength of insight, acceptance, optimism and gentleness. This is a novel about darkness, it walks in darkness, trembles in darkness. But the images of light and of sunshine are also appropriate because they come not from Dracula special effects but from a confident awareness of the aspirations, at once grubby and soaring, of that workhorse muscle, the human heart'.Hanrahan, John. \"Where You Go, I'll Follow\". Australian Book Review. June, 1993. No. 151. p.21-22. Compulsive Reader analysed the series' structure, stating 'the novels explore guilt and innocence, good and evil, and the individual versus the state or government, using changing tense and viewpoints... the characters swap positions, power matrices, emotional landscapes, and unravel the structures in which they work\u2019.Ball, Magdalena, \"A review of the Play with Knives trilogy by Jennifer Maiden\", Compulsive Reader (February 11, 2017).
