Mobberley railway station is on the Manchester to Chester line. Manchester Airport lies to the north of the village. == History == Mobberley is mentioned, as \"Motburlege\", in the Domesday Book of 1086. A priory was located here. Antrobus Hall was built in 1709. The church was mainly constructed around 1245. It was originally dedicated to both St Wilfrid & St Mary although in recent years St Mary has been \"dropped\". Hill House, is a 17th century black and white timbered framed house, that was originally in Woodlane Mobberley. It was the home of the Bacon family. The house was deconstructed and rebuilt on Nursery Lane in Nether Alderley to avoid destruction by the building of the second runway at Manchester Airport. The Grade II listed Hanson House, formerly the home of the Riddick family, was similarly relocated due to the runway construction, and is now located on Moss Lane, Siddington. Mobberley was the home of the Mallory family: George Mallory (1886\u20131924), a mountaineer who died attempting Mount Everest, and Air Chief Marshal Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory (1892\u20131944), who was air commander for the Allied Invasion of Normandy during World War II were both born in Mobberley. Their father, The Rev. Herbert Leigh Mallory, was rector of Mobberley. The Victory Hall was built in 1921 as a World War I memorial at a cost of \u00a34,500 on a plot of three quarters of an acre given by Mr R O Leycester. It was officially opened on 30 December 1921 and was refurbished in 1992. It is also home to many village organisations including the Women's Institute, Village Society and playgroup and is a regular place for locals \u2013 and wider \u2013 to hold a variety of celebrations and meetings. Mobberley has seen much change in recent years: first the opening of the nearby M56 from Manchester to Chester and then the Second Runway at Manchester Airport. These developments have led to Mobberley becoming largely a dormitory village of Manchester. Mobberley is well served by pubs. Mobberley appears in the opening chapter of the children's fantasy novel The Weirdstone of Brisingamen by Alan Garner. ==Sports== Mobberley has a cricket club which plays at Church Lane, in Division two of the Cheshire County Cricket League.Mobberley County Cricket Club.
