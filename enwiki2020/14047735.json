    "text": "US Army 101 is a 2-8-0 steam locomotive that was originally operated by the United States Army. It is one of two survivors of the 1,500 General Pershing locomotives built in 1916\u20131918 for the War Department in World War I. The 101 went on to see action in three wars \u2014 World War I, World War II, and the Korean War. After the Korean War, it was operated by the Korean National Railroad, which designated it \uc18c\ub9ac1-101 (Sori1). == History == US Army 101 was built for the US Army for use in World War I by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1918 and was under their ownership until it was donated to Korea in 1947. In 1953, the 101 was recovered from damaged areas and reconstructed by the Army Transportation Corps, under the direction of Col. George Simpson. It was soon discovered that 101 was still property of the Korean Republic. Col. George Simpson, Harold T.I. Shannon, and Harold E. Fuller started talks with the Korean Republic about donating the engine to the National Railroad Museum. In 1958 Korean Republic President Syngman Rhee donated the locomotive as a gift from the Korean people. On May 30, 1959, General Pershing was presented with a Certificate of Service from the Secretary of the Army. It is one of only three surviving Pershing Class locomotives, the others being the Texas State Railroad No. 300 and the CFR locomotive n\u00b0140 117 in Romania == References == ==External links== *National Railroad Museum * William M.
