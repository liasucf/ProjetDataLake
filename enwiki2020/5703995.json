    "text": "A Couch in New York (French title Un divan \u00e0 New York) is a 1996 film about an anonymous exchange of apartments between a successful New York psychoanalyst and a young woman from Paris. It was written and directed by Chantal Akerman. ==Plot== Henry Harriston is a psychoanalyst whose patients are driving him crazy by constantly leaving him messages during his off hours. On a whim he places an ad offering up his apartment for a housing swap. B\u00e9atrice Saulnier (Juliette Binoche) a Parisian dancer responds to his ad and without meeting the two switch apartments. B\u00e9atrice is impressed with Henry's high-tech apartment which is both beautiful and spacious. Henry meanwhile is horrified when he arrives in B\u00e9atrice's apartment and finds it filthy and messy. Meanwhile, Henry's patients, who Henry sees at home, begin coming to his apartment seeking therapy. B\u00e9atrice begins listening to their stories, and the patients accept her as Henry's temporary replacement. At B\u00e9atrice's apartment Henry discovers a cache of love-letters written to B\u00e9atrice by various men. B\u00e9atrice's lovers also begin showing up in her apartment and talking to Henry about their love for her. When they begin calling the apartment telling Henry how helpful he was and how they want to talk to him again he turns tail and returns to New York. Originally intending to simply pick up his mail, Henry notices that his patients keep coming in and out of his apartment and, when he tries to enter his apartment, is pushed out by B\u00e9atrice's friend who is posing as her receptionist. Believing that B\u00e9atrice is intentionally running a scam, he goes to confront her, posing as a fake patient, John. Instead of confronting her however, he keeps up the ruse of being a patient, but is unable to talk and the session consists of B\u00e9atrice and Henry saying \"Yes\" back and forth at one another. Despite this, the two find themselves attracted to one another and the session ends with B\u00e9atrice suggesting that Henry, as John, come back. Henry meanwhile is convinced that B\u00e9atrice really does mean well and decides to keep up the ruse and continue seeing her. After a particular session in which Henry talks about his distant relationship with his mother, both Henry and B\u00e9atrice begin to think they've fallen in love with one another. Henry refuses to say anything, feeling too cowardly, while B\u00e9atrice's friend tells her she cannot be involved in a relationship with a patient. B\u00e9atrice and Henry become close and continue to feel strongly towards one another. During one of their sessions the light turns off and both secretly whisper love confessions in the dark, but neither hears what the other is saying. Henry's friend urges him to run to B\u00e9atrice or write her a letter but as these are all things that B\u00e9atrice's previous lovers have done that have failed, Henry refuses. He decides that the only way the situation will be resolved is if B\u00e9atrice confesses her love to him. Instead she calls him late at night to tell him their sessions must come to an end as she is returning to Paris. Henry tells B\u00e9atrice he loves her, but she hangs up before she hears what he has said. Henry rushes to the airport hoping to get a last minute flight to Paris. Unfortunately, the plane is overbooked. Henry decides to wait on standby. He is able to get the last ticket as one passenger has not shown up, however that ticket belonged to B\u00e9atrice, so while Henry flies to Paris, searching the plane, looking for B\u00e9atrice, B\u00e9atrice stays behind. Eventually arriving home, B\u00e9atrice realizes she cannot go to her apart as Henry is still in her apartment and goes to stay with her neighbour. On her neighbour's terrace she sees her plants which have flourished in her absence. She strikes up a conversation with Henry, who she cannot see through the plants. He disguises his voice so she will not recognize him. Talking to Henry through the plants B\u00e9atrice confesses that she came early because she had fallen in love with one of Henry's patients, John. Realizing that Henry and John are one and the same person, B\u00e9atrice climbs over the terrace back into her apartment and kisses Henry, telling him she loves him. ==Cast== * Juliette Binoche - B\u00e9atrice Saulnier * William Hurt - Henry Harriston * Stephanie Buttle - Anne * Barbara Garrick - Lizbeth Honeywell * Paul Guilfoyle - Dennis * Richard Jenkins - Campton * Kent Broadhurst - Tim * Matthew Burton - Wood * Henry Bean - Stein * Bernard Breuse - J\u00e9r\u00f4me * Adam LeFevre - Restaurant Patron * Boris Leskin - Cab Driver #1 * Tiffany Frazer - Julie * Wendy Way - Employee at Airport * Jerry Dean - Cab Driver #2 ==Reception== The film received poor reviews upon release.
