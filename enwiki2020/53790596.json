    "text": "Allegory of Painting is an artwork painted by the Italian baroque artist Artemisia Gentileschi. It hangs in the Musee de Tesse, Le Mans, France. It is one of many paintings done by Gentileschi with this theme, but the depiction in this particular painting is unusual, and scholars have suggested it may have another meaning. Its attribution to Gentileschi is relatively recent, being associated with her in 1988. == References == Category:Paintings by Artemisia Gentileschi Category:1620s paintings ",
