    "text": "The London and North Western Railway (LNWR) Webb Coal Tank is a class of 0-6-2T steam locomotive. They were called \"Coal Tanks\" because they were a side tank version of Webb's standard 17 in Coal Engine, an 0-6-0 tender engine for slow freight trains. ==Design== The design was introduced in 1881 by F.W. Webb and had the same cheaply produced cast iron wheels and H-section spokes as the tender engines. A trailing radial axle supporting the bunker was added also with two similarly cast iron wheels. Three hundred were built between 1881 and 1897. ==Operational history== Four (LNWR nos. 178, 484, 1257, 69) were withdrawn in January\u2013February 1920 and a further four (LNWR nos. 142, 994, 782, 1012) in July and November 1922, so at the 1923 grouping, 292 passed to the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). They were renumbered from the LNWR's random allocation based on vacant numbers, to a solid block sequence 7550\u20137841, and given the power classification 1F. Many locomotives still in service in 1934 were renumbered by the addition of 20,000 to their number. Sixty-four locomotives passed into British Railways ownership in January 1948 and they were numbered 58880\u201358937, but not all examples survived long enough to carry their BR numbers. == Preservation == Dinting in 1982 The surviving Coal Tank wearing LMS unlined 1920s livery as No. 7799 when visiting the Severn Valley Railway in September 2012 One Coal Tank number BR 58926, ex-LMS 7799, originally LNWR 1054, the 250th one built, has survived in preservation on the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway, normally carrying its LNWR livery and number. The locomotive is owned by the National Trust and is maintained and run by the Bahamas Locomotive Society. ==Models== Bachmann Branchline released a model of the coal tanks in 2017. The three variants released were: -LNWR Black 1054 (As preserved) -LMS Black 7841 -BR Black early emblem 58900 So far, these are the only variants in production with no other liveries announced. http://www.hornbymagazine.com/2016/12/02/blog-warley- highlights/dsc_7731_lr/ https://www.hattons.co.uk/stocklist/SiteResults.aspx?searchfield=LNWR%20coal%20tank ==Notes== ==References== * * == External links == * Goods Engines of LNWR Category:0-6-2T locomotives Webb Coal Tank Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1881 Category:Standard gauge steam locomotives of Great Britain Category:C1\u2032 n2t locomotives ",
