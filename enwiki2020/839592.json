    "text": "Lake Uluabat ( and ) is the name of a freshwater lake in the vicinity of Bursa, Turkey. It is a large lake, covering an area of between 135 and 160 km2 depending on the water level, but very shallow, being only 3 m deep at its deepest point. The lake contains eight islands and one other that is sometimes an island and sometimes a peninsula. The largest island is known as Halilbey Island. In the southwest the lake is fed by the Mustafakemalpa\u015fa River, which has formed a silty delta. Water leaves the lake by way of the Ulubat stream, flowing to the west, and reaches the Sea of Marmara via the Susurluk River. Most shores of the lake are covered in submerged plants, and it has the most extensive white water lily beds in Turkey. Uluabat Lake is one of the breeding areas for the endangered pygmy cormorant (Phalacrocorax pygmeus). The latest DHKD (Society for the Protection of Nature Turkey) survey in June 1998 found 823 pygmy cormorant pairs, 105 night heron pairs, 109 squacco heron pairs, and 48 spoonbill pairs breeding on Uluabat. The alternative name Lake Apolyont comes from the lake's greek classical name Apolloniatis (\u0391\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2), from Apollonia-on-the-Rhyndacum (modern G\u00f6lyaz\u0131), an ancient Greek city situated on its banks which had considerable importance since it was on major trade routes. Modern residential areas by its shores are Mustafakemalpa\u015fa (formerly Kirmasti) and Karacabey (formerly Mikalick). The area was famous for centuries for its silkworm cultivation, but this industry has died out due to synthetic fabrics. The main industry today is fishing. ==Saint Constantine== St. Constantine is a small island inside the lake. During the Byzantine era, there was a monastery of St. Constantine on the island. Today the island is uninhabited, but the monastery has survived Ottoman conquest of Asia Minor. The orthodox monastery has received attention from scholars because of its inscribed cross type with apses east and west.Mango, Cyril. \"The Monastery of St. Constantine on Lake Apolyont.\" Dumbarton Oaks Papers, Vol. 33 (1979), pp. 329-333. ==Important Bird Area== The lake, which is in unprotected status, was declared by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area in 1989 for its waterfowl species of international character and species, which are globally threatened. ==See also== * Uluabat ==References== Uluabat Category:Ramsar sites in Turkey Category:Landforms of Bursa Province Category:Important Bird Areas of Turkey ",
