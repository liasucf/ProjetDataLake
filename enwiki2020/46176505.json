In 1929 Lane returned to the United States, living in Falls Church, Virginia and Washington, D.C. It was during this period that Lane's work came to the attention of Duncan Phillips. In April 1931 Lane was part of an exhibition at the Phillips Memorial Gallery with John Marin and Harold Weston. Between 1930 and 1939 Lane lived in Cambridge, England and Paris, France. From 1939 to 1946 Lane was living in Ontario, Canada. In 1946 Lane moved to the United States, teaching at Miss Porter's School from 1952 until 1965.
