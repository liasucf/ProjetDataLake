On 27 June 2015, it was severely damaged by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant after it had captured Palmyra. The statue was removed to the National Museum of Damascus and underwent reconstruction work, and now stands again. == Description == The statue, of a lion holding a crouching gazelle, was made from limestone ashlars in the early first century A.D. and measured in height, weighing 15 tonnes. The lion was regarded as the consort of Al-l\u0101t. The gazelle symbolized Al-l\u0101t's tender and loving traits, as bloodshed was not permitted under penalty of Al-l\u0101t's retaliation. The lion's left paw had a partially damaged Palmyrene inscription (PAT 1122) which reads: tbrk \u02be[lt] (Al-l\u0101t will bless) mn dy l\u02bey\u0161d (whoever will not shed) dm \u02bfl \u1e25gb\u02be (blood in the sanctuary).Van Baaren (1982), p. 65 and Reinhard G. Lehmann: \u201cKein Blutvergie\u00dfen!\u201d Die L\u00f6weninschrift der \u02beAll\u0101t von Palmyra, in: \u1e24BL Tadmor. Studies in Palmyrene Script and Language. KUSATU 23 (2018), pp. 3-8. == History == The statue before 2005 restoration. The statue was discovered in 1977 by a group of Polish archeologists from the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology of the University of Warsaw (PCMA UW) working under Prof. Micha\u0142 Gawlikowski. The lion of Al-l\u0101t was the basis for the PCMA UW logo design. The statue was found in pieces, having been reused in antiquity for the temple's foundation. Subsequently, it was decided to reassemble the pieces in front of the entrance to the Palmyra Museum. The task was undertaken by restorer J\u00f3zef Gazy. In 2005, it underwent restoration to eliminate problems from assemblage. Ultimately, the piece was restored in imitation of its original intended appearance \u2013 a relief jumping out from a wall. During the Syrian Civil War the statue was shielded with a metal plate and sandbags to protect it from fighting. On 27 June 2015, it was severely damaged by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant after it had captured Palmyra. After the liberation of Palmyra by the Syrian army, Syria's director- general of antiquities and museums Maamoun Abdulkarim declared that the pieces were still in place and it should be possible to put them back together, giving hopes for reconstruction. The statue was moved to Damascus in 2016, where it underwent complete restoration. On 1 October 2017, it was fully restored, and is currently on display in the National Museum of Damascus, until safety is assured in Palmyra to move it there again. ==See also== *Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL ==References== Category:1st-century Roman sculptures Category:Sculptures of lions Category:1st-century artifacts Category:1977 archaeological discoveries Category:Buildings and structures in Palmyra Category:Buildings and structures destroyed by ISIL Category:Limestone statues Category:Religious sculptures ",
