    "text": "Kenshin-ry\u016b is a style of Okinawan kobud\u014d that focuses on the use of the b\u014d staff that is taught as a complementary style to Shito-ry\u016b karate. As a supplementary style, it is known across the Japan, the US and Europe. One of its primary teachers is Akio Minakami. In theory, Kenshin-ry\u016b was the \"peasants' art\", and consists of several blocks, strikes, thrusts, and evasions. It is, however, an effective and powerful style that provides good basics and kihon that are easily absorbed into further kobud\u014d training with other styles. ==Basic Techniques== ===Uncategorized=== * Kiti-kai k'osh (sweep from left to right, upward snap to jaw, overhead downward strike) * 270 degree spin to the left * Upward push ===Sweeps=== * Back leg sweep * Hooking leg sweep - stepping forward * Hooking leg sweep - stepping backward ===Thrusts=== * Forward thrust * Sidestep thrust forward * Crouched side thrust * Downward back thrust ===Blocks=== * Push block - forward * Push block - downward * Spinning downward block ===Strikes=== * Spinning strike to the head * Overhead sword strike - forward * Overhead pulling strike - any direction may be used. In kata, 90 degrees right or 45 degrees left * Collarbone strike/crush, stepping forward * Collarbone strike/crush, stepping backward * Snap strike, right to left ==Fundamentals== Basic posture is a high front stance, right leg forward, with the hips rotated to face forward. The bo is held in three equal portions, with the left hand at the hip and the bo pointing at the opponent's throat. Forward strikes are either executed from the shoulder or above the head (kendo style), with the bo either being stopped with the left hand at the hip or with the staff tucked into the left armpit. This is substantially different from most other bo styles as normally the body is turned to the side, presenting a narrow target to the opponent. Direction changes are typically done by dropping the center of gravity while also opening the hips while stepping. Also, in some instances a 270 degree spin is employed that also includes a retreating step, or a simple step/step technique where the feet come together briefly and the body rotates to the desired direction before resuming the desired stance. Power is developed in most techniques by utilizing the rear leg and minimal hip rotation in combination with upper body torsion. Beginning students typically either use extremity strength only or exaggerate the leg push/hip rotation. This is rectified easily by repetition training and attacking a weighted target to train for timing. There are some thrusts and strikes that generate power from the rotation of the shoulders from a leading to a trailing position - these are most pronounced in Kubo no koan, and typically only performed properly by advanced students. Most of the strikes are pushed out by the upper body and generally don't generate much obvious speed due to the short distances traveled. The exception to this is found toward the end of Kubo no koan, which utilizes a long pulling motion to execute a blow to the head - this is similar to Yammani-ry\u016b. ==Kata== There are five (5), kata in the syllabus, though only the first three are generally taught outside Japan. There are minor variations in kata between schools that commonly teach it. * Shodan no koan * Nidan no koan * Kubo no koan * Sanbon no koan * 5th kata Category:Shit\u014d-ry\u016b Category:Okinawan kobudo ",
