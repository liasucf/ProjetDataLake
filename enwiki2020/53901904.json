It was written by band members Ryan Tedder, Brent Kutzle, Drew Brown, and Zach Filkins, as well as Tor Erik Hermansen and Mikkel Storleer Eriksen from the Norwegian production and songwriting duo Stargate. The song was co-produced by Stargate and Tedder. ==Background== After the release of OneRepublic's fourth full-length studio album, Oh My My, the band halted all plans for touring and promoting the album following its release. Ryan Tedder described in a lengthy post on the band's official Facebook page that they suffered from \"crippling anxiety\" due to the band's constant touring, recording, and promoting methods. Tedder revealed that the band was to begin releasing a new song \"monthly, weekly sometimes\", departing from their typical album cycle process. He went on to describe the band's future releases by stating \"[the songs] will be varied and with collaborations and may feel bonkers at first. Some will be remixes, others will be just me on piano or guitar. Some will sound super trendy and new, some will sound classic and old school or very OneRepublic.\" In the same post, Tedder confirmed that the band were to release \"new music scheduled 2 weeks\" after \"No Vacancy\". The song is the first of a string of singles to be released by OneRepublic. ==Lyric video== As of October 5, 2018, the lyric video has reached over 26.9 million views. ==Language versions== Bilingual versions of the song were announced and released. A bilingual English / Spanish version with Colombian singer Sebastian Yatra was released on 19 May 2017. A bilingual English / French version of the song was teased on OneRepublic's Vevo and YouTube accounts on 27 May 2017 with French singer Amir. On 7 July 2017, a new bilingual English / Italian version of the song was released with Italian singer Tiziano Ferro. ==Composition== \"No Vacancy\" is a dancehall/reggae-inspired tropical pop song.
