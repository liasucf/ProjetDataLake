    "text": "United Airlines Trip 4 was a Boeing 247D operating on a scheduled flight from Salt Lake City, Utah, to Cheyenne, Wyoming, on October 7, 1935. The aircraft last contacted Cheyenne at 2:16 or 2:17 a.m. reporting its position as Silver Crown. Cheyenne called the flight at 2:17, receiving no reply. The weather was virtually clear with ceiling unlimited. The wreckage was located three miles (4.8 km) east of Silver Crown. The aircraft struck the ground in a shallow descent just below a small knoll. Marks on the ground made by the propellers, fuselage, and engine showed the aircraft was in a normal flight attitude. Propeller marks and engine damage established the engines were developing normal power and the aircraft was at cruising speed. An untouched knoll 60 feet (18 m) further back on the flight path and three feet (0.9 m) higher established that the aircraft was descending. The pilot was believed to be flying on instruments. The probable cause was determined to be pilot error in failing to monitor altitude or location. ==External links== *Bureau of Air Commerce Accident Board Report Category:Airliner accidents and incidents in Wyoming Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the United States in 1935 4 Category:Disasters in Wyoming Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Boeing 247 Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by pilot error Category:Laramie County, Wyoming Category:1935 in Wyoming ",
