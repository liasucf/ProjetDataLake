In 2010, Viceral starred in a remake of the comedy film, Petrang Kabayo, which was an instant hit at its release. The following year, he starred in Praybeyt Benjamin with Derek Ramsay, directed by Wenn V. Deramas.

Also, the story behind his makeup line is that as a young boy, he would accidentally break his mother's lipsticks and realized how expensive they were. Therefore, he made his dream come true by creating Vice Cosmetics and making them affordable for anyone and everyone. == Inspirations == One of Vice Ganda's biggest inspirations is his teacher who told him to always follow his dreams no matter how big or wild they are. ==Public reception== Viceral's brand of humor has been viewed as polarizing. Much of his comedy style is sarcasm, making fun of current events, and picking on the physical appearance or social status of other people. The latter has been met with criticism from some Filipino audiences, viewing it as a denigrating form of insult comedy or off- color humor at the expense of those mocked by the comedian. === Controversies === ==== Gang rape jokes against Jessica Soho ==== In May 2013, Viceral was widely criticized for making several jokes about gang rape during his I-Vice Ganda Mo Ko! comedy concert show. One of them was directed towards respected news anchor Jessica Soho, whom he mentioned in a joke regarding several personalities starring in a hypothetical adult movie. Philippine women's rights group GABRIELA condemned the joke as being distasteful in light of rape victims. GMA reporter Arnold Clavio, a colleague of Soho, defended the news anchor and expressed his disapproval of Viceral's body-shaming remark in one of the former's radio programs. Although Viceral, initially defended his stance, saying that the brand of humor he uses is based on his roots doing stand-up in comedy bars and karaoke lounges, the comedian eventually issued an apology over the issue during an episode of It's Showtime. ====Nora Aunor==== Noted actress Nora Aunor also took umbrage at Viceral's style of humor when she pulled out of her appearance as a special guest judge for the Tawag ng Tanghalan grand finals at the last minute. Aunor believed Viceral's brand of insult comedy was against her moral beliefs, and was perturbed with the idea of being on the show alongside Viceral. ====Apollo Quiboloy==== Following the performance by Gian Magdangal on Tawag ng Tanghalan: Celebrity Champions, Viceral launched a joke about the earthquakes in Mindanao, Viceral made a challenge against Apollo Quiboloy, the founder of Kingdom of Jesus Christ to stop Ang Probinsyano and its traffic in EDSA. Despite being a joke, the members of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ expressed their dismay to Viceral. Radio broadcaster and SMNI anchor, Mike Abe, a friend of Quiboloy, defended the founder and launched his foul-mouthed tirade on Viceral about the controversial \"stop\" joke on Quiboloy. Two days after the joke, Quiboloy accepts Viceral's challenge and he threatened to shut down ABS-CBN within 4 months, which originally expires on March 30, 2020, but it was changed to May 4, 2020 based on Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra's speech during the Senate hearing on alleged violations made by ABS-CBN. Two weeks after the shutdown of ABS-CBN, Quiboloy delievered the message to Viceral on his show, Powerline, that he prophesized the network, Ang Probinsyano to be stopped. ====Rodante Marcoleta==== On May 26, during the 1st hearing of ABS-CBN's new 25-year franchise, Sagip Partylist Representative and Deputy Speaker Rodante Marcoleta presented its videos, showing Viceral starting a joke to Quiboloy to stop Ang Probinsyano, it's traffic in EDSA and Quiboloy's response to shut the network. Marcoleta warned ABS-CBN, that has posed it's challenge and the challenge was accepted, after the hearing, Viceral fires back on Marcoleta on his Twitter post, claiming that was a joke. === Cultural impact === As cited by Bautista (2012), researchers from University of San Jose - Recoletos studied the role of sarcasm and criticism on Filipino humor. Half of 100 participants stated that they gain more confidence from mimicking Viceral's style of humor, while 64% of the respondents said that they usually imitate Viceral's sarcasm during conversations. ==Filmography== ==Discography== ===Studio album=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
