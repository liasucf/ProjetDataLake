This is an annual or biennial herb producing a spindly, branching, erect stem variable in height from 20 centimeters to well over one meter. The stems are reddish and generally glandular. The small leaves are mostly located toward the base of the stem and are finely divided into linear lobes. The spreading inflorescence produces several flower heads, each lined with hairy, glandular phyllaries. Each head has a fringe of rounded yellow ray florets about half a centimeter long and a center of yellow disc florets. The fruit is a dark-colored achene 3 or 4 millimeters long. If there is any pappus it is small and scale-like.Flora of North America Vol. 21 Page 393 Amauriopsis dissecta (A. Gray) Rydberg Rydberg, Per Axel in Britton, Nathaniel Lord. 1914.
