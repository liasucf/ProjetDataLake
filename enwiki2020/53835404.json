Its first exhibit opened in 1999, and features exhibits on cannabis (drug), coca, and poppy. The museum has appeared on a list of ten best 420 sites published in USA Today. Fodor's calls its exhibits \"hard hitting\"; Lonely Planet's guide to Washington D.C. sarcastically recommended the museum \"If...you think all drug users and pushers should go to jail for a very long time and drugs and terrorism go hand in hand -- or if you just have a thing for heavy-handed propaganda\". ==References== ==External links== * Category:1999 establishments in Virginia Category:Cannabis museums Category:Law enforcement museums in the United States Category:Museums established in 1999 Category:Museums in Arlington County, Virginia Category:Medical museums in the United States ",
