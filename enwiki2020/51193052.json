Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network gave the first volume an overall rating of a C+ citing the theme of bondage as a possible issue for readers. Silverman points out that there are many similar themes to the manga series Inu x Boku SS, while also calling it a \"sister\" series or extension. While she praises the good interaction between the characters and the cute artwork, Silverman states that nothing sets the story apart from \"the standard\". Brandon Varnell from \"The Fandom Post\" also reviewed the first volume, and concurred with Silverman on the story not being very original. Varnell went on to say that he can already tell how the story will end, but has been surprised \"on occasion\". He gave the overall content, packaging, and translation a \"B\" grade and gave an \"A\" for the artwork. Varnell later did a review on the fifth volume calling the series overall \"the funnest, underrated series of our time\". Although Varnell highly praised the character development up to this point, his overall grading remained about the same. Sean Gaffney from Manga Bookshelf also pointed out the similarity to \"Inu x Boku SS\" saying that he can get the same good things in Spirits & Cat Ears from other better series. Gaffney didn't call the series \"completely terrible\", but recommends it for people who like nekomimis and/or a \"teasing sort-of boyfriend\" that is into dressing his girlfriend in \"sexy\" outfits. == See also == *Blend S \u2013 Another manga by the same author ==References== ==External links== * Official website at Kadokawa * Spirits & Cat Ears at Yen Press * Category:Comedy anime and manga Category:Seinen manga Category:Media Factory manga Category:Yen Press titles ",
