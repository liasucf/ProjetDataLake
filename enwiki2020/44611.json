It comes in wheels and approximately 4 cm thick, and is matured for one to two weeks in dry cellar. It is also available as a fresh cheese (non affin\u00e9) that resembles rich cream cheese.

The extra aging time concentrates the proteins and salt in the cheese, resulting in deeper earthy flavors and more intense salty taste. Wheels of Pierre Robert are physically smaller due to loss of moisture, yet creamier than the regular- aged Brillat Savarin. ==See also== * List of French cheeses * List of cheeses ==References== Category:French cheeses Category:Cow's-milk cheeses ",
