    "text": "The Anglican Orthodox Southern Episcopal Church (AOSEC) denomination formed in August 2009, out of The Southern Episcopal Church and separated officially becoming the Anglican Orthodox Southern Episcopal Church in the United States of America. All Saints AOSEC Church, in Nashville, Tennessee, is the national headquarters for the AOSEC with The Right Reverend Huron C. Manning Jr as Presiding Bishop. The building, located in the Sylvan Park neighborhood of the western end of the city, once housed St. Andrew's Episcopal Church. The AOSEC has churches in Tennessee, Mississippi, Ohio, Kentucky and Oklahoma. The distinctives of the AOSEC are use of the 1928 Book of Common Prayer for its liturgy, adherence to the 39 Articles of Religion and use of the 1611 Authorized Version of the King James Bible for all public readings of Scripture. The AOSEC would also fall under the directives of the Continuing Anglican movement, also known as the Anglican Continuum, or Traditionalist Anglicanism, which encompasses a number of Christian churches in various countries that are Anglican in faith, history, and practice while remaining outside the official Anglican Communion. These churches generally believe that traditional forms of Anglican faith and worship have been unacceptably revised or abandoned within some Anglican Communion churches in recent decades. They claim, therefore, that they are \"continuing\" or preserving Anglicanism's line of Apostolic Succession as well as historic Anglican belief and practice. ==References== Category:Episcopacy in Anglicanism ",
