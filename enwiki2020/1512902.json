    "text": "{| |} Jean de Vienne was a F70 type anti-submarine frigate of the French Marine Nationale. The French navy does not use the term \"destroyer\" for its ships; hence some large ships, referred to as \"frigates\", are registered as destroyers. She is the third French vessel named after the 14th century admiral Jean de Vienne. Her complement is 20% female. Jean de Vienne was laid down on 26 October 1979 and launched 17 November 1981. She was accepted into the French navy on 25 May 1984. ==Service history== In 2001 Jean de Vienne was part of the task force deployed to the Indian Ocean as part of Op\u00e9ration H\u00e9rakl\u00e8s, the initial French contribution to the War in Afghanistan. While deployed there, she was part of the escort for the aircraft carrier . On 4 January 2009 Jean de Vienne helped to defend the Croatian tanker Donat, owned by the Tankerska plovidba from Zadar, and the Panamanian-flagged cargo ship Vulturnus, off Somalia. In 2011, the ship deployed as part of Op\u00e9ration Harmattan, the French contribution to NATO's involvement in the military intervention in Libya. ==References== ==External links== * Jean de Vienne at the French navy website Category:Active frigates of France Category:Georges Leygues-class frigates Category:1981 ships Category:Ships built in France ",
