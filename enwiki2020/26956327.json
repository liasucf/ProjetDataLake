The primary focuses are plants and animals that are native to California, specifically Kern County. The California Living Museum is accredited by the Zoological Association of America (ZAA). ==History== CALM was founded in 1983. Its purpose was to provide a place to both educate the public about native wildlife, as well as to help injured and orphaned wild animals. Those that could be released into the wild would be, while others would be cared for in the facility. A campaign went out to many service organizations to sponsor buildings within the facility. After three years, the zoo was opened to the public. In 1998, the day-to-day operations of The California Living Museum were transferred to the Kern Superintendent of Schools offices (KCSOS). The zoo and botanical gardens became an official school site. CALM provides education to more than 13,000 Kern County school children annually through on-site programs. Many programs are also presented off-site to classrooms, organizations and at community events. CALM received accreditation from the Zoological Association of America (ZAA) in 2010.CALM Receives National Accreditation. Critter Capers. Spring 2010.

The California Living Museum exists to display and interpret native California animals, plants, fossils and artifacts to teach a respect for all living things through education, recreation, conservation and research. Located on 14 park-like acres, CALM's zoo features over 80 species of medically unreleasable animals. Only animals injured or who cannot survive in their native environment are housed at CALM. Several endangered species may be seen on exhibit. Natural exhibits include: \u2022 An open black bear exhibit, \u2022 Cats of California exhibit featuring mountain lions and bobcats, \u2022 Bird of Prey Exhibit with hawks, owls and eagles, \u2022 A mammal round that houses several species of foxes, \u2022 A waterfowl pond that attracts spring and fall migrants and hosts resident mallards, \u2022 A deer yard, \u2022 An underground reptile house, and \u2022 A contact area with domestic animals. The DiGiorgio Education Center, which is the visitor's first stop, houses the gift store, a reading library, Miocene and Pleistocene fossils, and children's discovery rooms with rotating interactive activities. CALM also provides services which include birthday parties, weddings and other group events. The California Living Museum is a permitted rehabilitation facility and has a staff trained to care for injured wildlife. The primary goal of rehabilitation is to release the wildlife back into their natural habitat. CALM rehabilitates approximately 300-500 injured and orphaned animals annually. In addition to animals, CALM also contains several plant communities. These replicate a variety of environments from around Kern County, from the mountains, to the Mojave Desert. Such walks include the \u201cTrees of California,\u201d which showcases the trees found of the western and eastern mountain ranges.
