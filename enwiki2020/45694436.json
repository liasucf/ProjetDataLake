    "text": "Getting Somewhere is the fifth studio album by singer/songwriter Allison Moorer. The album was produced by Moorer's new husband and fellow singer/songwriter Steve Earle and recorded in Nashville. Written on the road while touring with Earle, it saw her embrace a more pop sound and became her first album where the majority of songs were written solely by Moorer. She told PopMatters in 2004: \"Some of the records I\u2019ve made have had a lot of cooks, for lack of a better word. This one basically was just me and Steve, and I had written all the songs while he was around. We were on the road together, and so he had a ringside seat for the whole writing of it. So when we went in to make the record in December, it was kind of just a given what we were going to do.\"http://www.popmatters.com/feature/moorer-allison-060609/ ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Rev.
