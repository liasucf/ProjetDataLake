    "text": "The Devil's Advocate is a 1959 novel by Australian author Morris West. It forms part of West's \"Vatican\" sequence of novels, along with The Shoes of the Fisherman (1963), The Clowns of God (1981), and Lazarus (1990).Answers.com ==Plot== Father Blaise Meredith, a dying English priest, is sent from the Vatican to a small village in Calabria to investigate the life of Giacomo Nerone, a local being touted for sainthood. Meredith was chosen for the task because Cardinal Marotta wanted someone learned and meticulous; someone who might be lacking in charity, but not in precision. The residents of the nearby village of Gemello Maggiore are promoting Nerone's cult because it will bring prestige to the area. Meredith discovers that Nerone was in fact a deserter from the British army, who had an illegitimate son by a local woman, and was executed by Communist partisans towards the end of World War II, yet is a man revered in his small village. ==Development== Fluent in both French and Italian, West visited southern Italy in the 1950s, where he wrote the 1957 non-fiction Children of the Sun, which described the lives of street urchins in Naples. As a result, he was offered a job as Vatican correspondent for the London Daily Mail.Thurber, Jon. \"Morris L.
