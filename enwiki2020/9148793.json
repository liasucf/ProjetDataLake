Forman was originally an athletic director, but his funny remarks led the management to place him on the stage as a comedian, though Forman wished to become a serious actor. Forman broke into show business after winning an Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts program.Gaver, Jack Joe Forman Has Good Season With Sid Caesar The Schenectady Gazette 8 January 1964 He first attracted attention in Las Vegas as the opening act for Mickey Rooney and also Rooney's straight man. He also co-starred in Mickey Rooney's 1954\u20131955 NBC sitcom The Mickey Rooney Show: Hey, Mulligan, as Mickey's best friend, Freddy, and appeared with him in the films Andy Hardy Comes Home (1958) and The Big Operator (1959). Forman was considered a standard Borscht Belt comic, and he performed standup comedy both live and on television (including shows like The Hollywood Palace). He also took on comedic roles in films and on television. Forman appeared in two episodes of The Monkees, first as jealous kids show host \"Captain Crocodile\" in an eponymous episode, then as Asian criminal \"Dragonman\" in \"Monkees Chow Mein\". He also appeared in three Get Smart episodes, including two episodes as \"Harry Hoo\", a parody of Charlie Chan.

Forman distinguished himself from the field by inventing a character called \"The Mashuganishi Yogi\", a parody of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. In 1968, working with Bill Dana, he produced a comedy album consisting of a faux press conference, in which he responded to mostly-straight questions with funny answers, speaking in a stereotyped Indian accent. He was accompanied with a sitarist, \"Harvey Shankar\", a parody of Ravi Shankar (played by Dana). ==Later years/death== In later television appearances, he would sometimes reprise his Yogi character.
