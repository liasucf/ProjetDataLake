His photograph of the flooding of the Jordan River in 1963 was used on the front cover of \"Yediot Aharonot\", along with another two of his pictures. He moved to Jerusalem to be a freelance photojournalist, taking photographs of celebrities such as Marc Chagall, Teddy Kolek, Moshe Dayan, and Golda Meir. His pictures of poor Moroccan Jews in Haifa gained exposure for their living conditions and plans were made to improve the housing situation. Elbaz has taken photographs of the terrorist attack of the bus on the children of Avivim, the Yom Kippur War, negotiations of the cease-fire with the Egyptians at Km 101, the Litani Operation, the Jewish/Arab tension and the friction between the Hasidic and African American communities in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Elbaz first moved to Toronto to work as a freelance photographer for the paper Canadian Jewish News. Elbaz won first prize in a photography competition with the subject \"Israel\" in the Jewish Chronicle with a photograph called \"Torah and Peace\". He became an art dealer and eventually opened two art galleries in Toronto and two in the Soho district of Manhattan, New York. In his galleries Elbaz has sold the works of Fernando Botero, Yaacov Agam, Michael Eisemann, and the original silk screens of Andy Warhol's \"10 Jewish Geniuses\". His own work focuses on tension between communities.Jewish Journal, March 9th, 1993 http://www.jacobelbaz.com/#!press/zoom/clud/image_1kbvThe Jewish Week, 1993 http://www.jacobelbaz.com/#!press/zoom/clud/image_1tz3Where the gun is the staff of life http://www.jacobelbaz.com/#!press/zoom/clud/image_1hrkThe Jewish Voice, 1993 http://www.jacobelbaz.com/#!press/zoom/clud/i1114qp His work has been featured in Canadian Jewish News,The Canadian Jewish News, December 20th, 1974 http://www.jacobelbaz.com/#!press/zoom/clud/i0navThe Canadian Jewish News, March 14th, 1975 http://www.jacobelbaz.com/#!press/zoom/clud/i1llhThe Canadian Jewish News, June 21st, 1974 http://www.jacobelbaz.com/#!press/zoom/clud/i21k03ARTnews,ARTnews, 1992 http://www.jacobelbaz.com/#!press/zoom/clud/image_7qs The Jewish Press, San Diego Jewish Times,The San Diego Jewish Times, December 17th, 1992 http://www.jacobelbaz.com/#!press/zoom/clud/i51gio The Toronto Chronicle,The Toronto Chronicle, September, 1976 http://www.jacobelbaz.com/#!press/zoom/clud/i8bdz and Time.Time Magazine (Europe and Mideast), March 17th, 1975 Thirty six years after leaving, Elbaz returned to Israel.
