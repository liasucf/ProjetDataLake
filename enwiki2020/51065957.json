His uncle was the influential royal treasurer and judge Nicholas Z\u00e1mb\u00f3. Lawrence and his elder brother John also took the Z\u00e1mb\u00f3 surname after their uncle. Lawrence was first mentioned by contemporary records in 1374.Engel: Geneal\u00f3gia (Genus P\u00e1pa, Z\u00e1mb\u00f3 de Mez\u0151lak branch) He attended the University of Prague in 1383, then the University of Vienna in 1384, when he already held the position of provost. In Prague, he studied at the Faculty of Law, where he copied numerous legal texts, adapting them to Hungarian conditions. These works now are preserved by the Rare Books and Early Manuscripts at the Harvard Law School. During his term as Provost of Pressburg, he had several jurisdictional conflicts and disputes with the vicar of the nominal supervisional Archdiocese of Esztergom, the local Cathedral Chapter of Pressburg, and with the canons from the surrounding areas. He was the last provost in Pressburg who was appointed as a candidate of a Pope. ==References== ==Sources== * * * Category:1402 deaths Category:14th-century Hungarian people Category:Charles University alumni Category:University of Vienna alumni Category:Hungarian Roman Catholic priests Lawrence ",
