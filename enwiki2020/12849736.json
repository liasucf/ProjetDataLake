    "text": "The RPG-40 was an anti-tank hand grenade developed by the Soviet Union in 1940. ==Description== Upon contact, 760 grams of explosives contained within it were detonated and produced a blast effect. This enabled about 20-25 mm of armour to be penetrated and caused secondary damage, such as spalling, on contact with thicker armour. This made the grenade very effective against earlier German tanks, but ineffective against later models, such as the Panzer IV and the Panzer V, leading to the RPG-43 replacing it in 1943. ==Users== * ==See also== * List of Russian weaponry * No. 73 Grenade ==References== ==External links== * Soviet Grenades at LoneSentry.com Category:Hand grenades of the Soviet Union Category:Anti-tank grenades Category:World War II infantry weapons of the Soviet Union ",
