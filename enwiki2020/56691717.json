Carrying a crew of five, it was of aerodynamically clean appearance and its wing had an unusually high aspect ratio. ==Design== Developed in 1943, the P 184 was a large, long-range reconnaissance and patrol landplane capable of superseding the Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor. It was of conventional layout but, like many B&V; designs, of innovative structure using a high proportion of steel.Cowin (1963)Luft46 The fuselage nose was fully glazed to provide excellent vision to the crew, all accommodated in the nose cabin. Behind the cabin, the entire centre section of the fuselage formed one giant integral fuel tank. The tail housed a defensive gun turret and a single retractable tailwheel. Further defensive armament was provided by a remote-controlled barbette under the fuselage. The mid-mounted wing was of very high aspect ratio, having a large span combined with a relatively short chord to make it highly efficient. Four identical nacelles, distributed along the constant-chord centre section of the wing, each housed a BMW 801E radial engine providing almost takeoff power, with a retractable main undercarriage leg behind. The outer wing sections had a slight taper. As with most B&V; designs, the main wing structure was an integral steel box which served as additional integral fuel tankage. ==Specifications Blohm und Voss P.184.01== ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== * * Hugh Cowin; \"Blohm und Voss Projects of World War II\" Part III, Air Pictorial, December 1963, pp. 404\u2013406. * P 184 Category:Abandoned military aircraft projects of Germany ",
