    "text": "This is a list of notable quarterbacks who are of races besides African or European descent who have played American or Canadian football professionally or in college. In professional and college football, the quarterback position, often considered the most important position in the sport, has historically been mostly white, with black quarterbacks growing in number since the latter half of the 20th century despite race-related struggles.
