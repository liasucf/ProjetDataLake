It aims to purify, mature, and perfect certain objects. Latin words for Chemistry are derived from the ancient word kimia. The meaning of Kimia, in the Persian literature refers to what is behind the \u2018materialistic\u2019 conception of alchemy, and instead to the secret of the spirit\u2019s action in nature and the Universe, the macro-cosmos. By acquiring this divine wisdom of action, alchemists aspired to discover their inner (microcosmic) reality, and transmute themselves. Corbin, 1986, pp. 71-87, 196-208; Nasr, chapter 9 The word appears ubiquitously in Persian literature. Some early usages can be seen in Vis and Ramin and Ferdowsi\u2019s Shahnameh. Other samples in verse and prose are: _\u201cThe alchemy of happiness is what counts in life, Told Kasra his minister Bozorgmehr\u201d_ \u2014-Naser Khosrow _\u201cA hundred thousand alchemies created by The Truth Yet no alchemy like patience is known to Man\u201d_ \u2014\u2014Rumi The word Kimia has been frequently been used in other Persian poetry, including those of Hafez Shirazi: \u0627\u0632 \u06a9\u06cc\u0645\u06cc\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u0647\u0631 \u062a\u0648 \u0632\u0631 \u06af\u0634\u062a \u0631\u0648\u06cc \u0645\u0646 \u0622\u0631\u06cc \u0628\u0647 \u06cc\u0645\u0646 \u0644\u0637\u0641 \u0634\u0645\u0627 \u062e\u0627\u06a9 \u0632\u0631 \u0634\u0648\u062f \"By your love\u2019s alchemy, my face became bright gold Thanks to your grace, the dust can become gold.\" or \u0622\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0647 \u062e\u0627\u06a9 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u0646\u0638\u0631 \u06a9\u06cc\u0645\u06cc\u0627 \u06a9\u0646\u0646\u062f \u0622\u06cc\u0627 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u06af\u0648\u0634\u0647 \u0686\u0634\u0645\u06cc \u0628\u0647 \u0645\u0627 \u06a9\u0646\u0646\u062f \"Those whose glance turns lead into gold, Will they ever our sight behold?\" ==Notable persons== * Kimia Alizadeh (born 1998), Iranian Olympian athlete and taekwondo player *Kimia Hosseini (born 2003), Iranian actress ==References== ",
