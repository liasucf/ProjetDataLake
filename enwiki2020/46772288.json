He received his training at the Minerva Academy in Groningen from 1934 to 1937. During his training he was primarily engaged in sculpture and painting, and later experimented with pottery. Holman lived and worked in Grootegast, and sold most of his products himself traveling on his ship through the Netherlands. Holman made a number of sculptures and wall sculptures of resin stone, that were placed in the public space. Holman often made use of earthy tones and knew his work to provide smooth surfaces with crystal glaze. From the fifties he decorated his work with abstracted motifs and geometric patterns.Doele, S. en R. Hodel (1985) \"Derk Holman in het Princessehof.
