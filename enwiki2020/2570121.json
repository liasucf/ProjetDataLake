(; ; ) are a mountain range of the Western Sudetes on the southeastern border of Germany with the Czech Republic. They are a continuation of the Ore Mountains range west of the Elbe valley. The mountains of the northern, German, part are called the Zittau Mountains. == Geography == The Lausche, viewed from the north The range is among the westernmost extensions of the Sudetes, which stretch along the border between the historic region of Silesia in the north, and Bohemia and Moravia in the south up to the Moravian Gate in the east, where they join the Carpathian Mountains. The northwestern foothills of the Lusatian Mountains are called the Lusatian Highlands; in the southwest the range borders on the \u010cesk\u00e9 St\u0159edoho\u0159\u00ed mountains. The range is largely made up of sandstone sedimentary rocks leaning on a Precambrian crystalline basement. The northern ridge is marked by the Lusatian Fault, a geological disturbance zone separating the Bohemian sandstones from the Lusatian granodiorite. During the Tertiary volcanic magma streams broke through the sandstone layer and solidified into basalt and phonolite. Several sandstone contact areas were also hardened to columns and distinct rock formations. == Mountains and hills == P\u011bnkav\u010d\u00ed vrch View of Kl\u00ed\u010d in winter The highest peak is the Lausche (793 m).

Administratively it is known as the Lusatian Mountains Protected Landscape Area (CHKO Lu\u017eick\u00e9 hory) and has the status of CHKO, a so-called Landscape park. The smaller German part of the mountains also became a nature protection in 2008, when the Zittau Mountain Nature Park was established, with the effect that the entire Lusatian Mountains is now under some form of nature protection. == See also == * List of regions of Saxony * Lusatian Highlands * Bohemian track == References == == External links == * Czech site * Photos of the Lusatian Mountains Category:Sudetes Category:Mountain ranges of the Czech Republic Category:Regions of Saxony Category:Mountain ranges of Saxony ",
