The building is part of the Paradise redevelopment scheme in the city centre and is to be designed by Glenn Howells Architects. Due to its unique design, Octagon is envisaged by its developers as becoming a landmark building for the city. The building will house 364 homes, being 1 bed, 2 bed and 3 bed apartments. Subject to planning approval, work on Octagon is set to begin in 2021 with an aim for completion by 2024. On completion, the building will become the tallest octagonal shaped residential skyscraper in the world. Additionally, if other proposed buildings in Birmingham come to fruition, it will become the joint second tallest building in Birmingham - second to 100 Broad Street (193 metres) and joint with One Eastside. It is three metres taller than the city's current tallest structure as of 2020, the BT Tower (152 metres). The planning application for Octagon was submitted to Birmingham City Council in October 2020.https://www.paradisebirmingham.co.uk/2020/10/19/planning-octagon-tower- submitted/ == References == Category:Unfinished buildings and structures ",
