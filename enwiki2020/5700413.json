It is owned by the non-profit development agency BRAC, and employs thousands of rural artisans across the country. It currently operates fourteen outlets in six Bangladeshi metropolitan cities. The organisation was established in 1978. Aarong operates production units in rural and semi-urban areas as a part of its social enterprise model and provides the market linkage through its own retail outlets. ==Allegations== Directorate of National Consumers' Right Protection (DNCRP) fined Tk4.5 lakh to Uttara outlet of Aarong and closed it for a day for selling same products in double price within a gap of five days. Following on a client's complaint that Aarong was selling a panjabi after nearly doubling its price, DNCRP officials visited the chain's flagship store on Jashimuddin Avenue at Uttara on 31 May 2019 and fined them after finding the allegation to be true. Monjur Mohammad Shahriar, deputy director of Directorate of National Consumers' Right Protection (DNCRP) led the drive but he was transferred later. ==References== Category:Retail companies of Bangladesh Category:Companies based in Dhaka Category:Organisations based in Motijheel Category:Retail companies established in 1978 Category:1978 establishments in Bangladesh Category:Bangladeshi brands Category:Clothing brands of Bangladesh ",
