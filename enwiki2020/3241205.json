Tuhay Bey became the bey of Or Qap\u0131 sometime between 1642 and 1644, an important position of the Crimean Khanate who was in charge of Or Qap\u0131 fortress - the gateway to the peninsula. By 1644 he had enough authority for the Khan of Crimea to entrust to him leadership of the major Tatar expedition against Poland. However, Tuhay Bey's army was intercepted by the Polish army under hetman Koniecpolski before reaching the densely populated regions of Ukraine and defeated in the First Battle of Okhmativ. In 1648 he brought an army (estimated 6,000-20,000) to help Bohdan Khmelnytsky during the Cossack uprising against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. There he took part in several important battles and was eventually killed during the Battle of Berestechko.Podhorodecki, page 193Serczyk, page 339 He was portrayed in the Polish novel and film With Fire and Sword. In the film he was played by Daniel Olbrychski. File:Matejko_Khmelnytsky_with_Tugay_Bey.jpg|An imagined painting of \" Bohdan Khmelnytsky with Tuhay Bey at Lviv\", oil on canvas by Jan Matejko, 1885.
