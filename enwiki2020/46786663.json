It was designed to wear and not shatter in the event of a crash. This initial protector used a thin metal sleeve inside, meaning strength was increased while also allowing the fitter to torque the protector. The bung also used a particular grade of steel bolt that helped absorb an impact by bending, rather than snapping or twisting its mounting point on the bike. Currently, R&G; has hundreds of separate products, comprising largely protective items. The current product range includes \u201cAdventure Bars\u201d, \u201cAero Crash Protectors\u201d, Bar End Sliders, Boot Guards, Brake Lines, Chain Guards, \u201cCotton Reels\u201d, Dashboard Screen Protectors, \u201cDownpipe Grilles\u201d, Dust Covers, Ear Protectors, \u201cElevation\u201d Paddock Stand Bobbins, Engine Case Covers, Engine Case Sliders, Exhaust Hangers, Exhaust Protectors, Exhaust Sliders, Fender Extenders, Fork Protectors, Frame Plugs, Gloves, Headlight Shields, Heated Grips, Helmet Holdalls, Indicator Adaptors, \u201cKickstand Shoes\u201d, \u201cLockstop Savers\u201d, Mirror Blanking Plates, Nano Coating Spray, \u201cOffset Cotton Reels\u201d, Oil Cooler Guards, Outdoor Covers, Paddock Stands, Paddock Stand Bobbins, Radiator Guards, Radiator Sliders, Rearsets, Rear Footrest Plates, Rear Huggers, Reservoir Protectors, Rim Tape, Second Skin, Shocktube \u00ae, \u201cSpindle Sliders\u201d, Swingarm Protectors, Tail Tidies, Tail Sliders, Tank Grips, Tank Sliders, Tie-Down Hooks, Toe Chain Guards and \u201cUnderbody Frame Sliders\u201d. ==Partnerships== R&G; has a long history with the California Superbike School, both in the US and UK, and previously in the Middle East.
