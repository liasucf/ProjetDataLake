Hollywood was incorporated as a municipality in November 1903. The Hollywood High Organ Opus 481 was a gift from the class of 1924. After suffering severe water damage from the Northridge earthquake in 1994, it was restored in 2002. The campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 4, 2012. The school's mascot was derived from the 1921 Rudolph Valentino film of the same name, The Sheik. In the 2015\u201316 football season, the boys' varsity football team played in the school's third championship game led by head coach Frank Galvan. They finished the season with a 12\u20132 record.
