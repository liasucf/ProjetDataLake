    "text": "The 2020\u201321 First Professional Football League, also known as Efbet League for sponsorship reasons, is the 97th season of the top division of the Bulgarian football league system, the 72nd since a league format was adopted for the national competition of A Group as a top tier of the pyramid, and also the 5th season of the First Professional Football League, which decides the Bulgarian champion. Ludogorets Razgrad are the defending champions for the ninth consecutive time. The season was initially set to start on 24 July 2020, but began on 7 August 2020 due to the COVID-19 situation in Bulgaria. ==Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic== All matches were at first envisioned to be held without spectators, at least until 31 August, but this was reversed in early August (allowing for matches to be held at 50% stadium capacity and up to 1000 people per stand), reportedly under pressure from fan groups, with the government's inconsistency on the matter in turn criticized in certain circles. Two Ludogorets Razgrad players tested positive for coronavirus just prior to the beginning of the championship. In September 2020, the whole Etar team was initially quarantined by the regional health authorities in Veliko Tarnovo after 5 footballers' and 2 staff members' PCR tests indicated that they were infected, but the match against Lokomotiv eventually went ahead without the date being changed. The fixture between Arda and Ludogorets Razgrad that was to be held on 4 October 2020 was postponed after more than 10 footballers' tests from the Kardzhali team (as well as a trainer) returned positive results. ==Teams== Fourteen teams are competing in the league \u2013 the top eleven teams from the previous season, the team that finished in first place in the Second League, and the two winners of the promotion/relegation playoffs. CSKA 1948 were promoted as champions of the 2019\u201320 Second League and will make their debut in the top tier of Bulgarian football. The second team to be promoted was Montana, who earned promotion after winning their play-off match against Dunav Ruse. The club returns after three seasons in the second tier, following their relegation in the 2016\u201317 season, while Dunav ended their four-year stay in the First League. ===Stadiums and locations=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:0.5em auto;\" |- !
