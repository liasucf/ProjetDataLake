The station is located on the Stadtbahn line, served by the , , , and lines of the Berlin S-Bahn, as well as by Regional-Express and Regionalbahn trains operated by Deutsche Bahn. The U-Bahn station Wilmersdorfer Stra\u00dfe (U7) can be reached via short footpath. ==History== Charlottenburg Station on Stuttgarter Platz, 1907 postcard The station was opened on 7 February 1882 as the western endpoint of the Stadtbahn line in the then independent town of Charlottenburg. From here the Berlin-Blankenheim railway ran southwestwards, a section of the Kanonenbahn rail route to Metz in Alsace-Lorraine. The old station hall was damaged in World War II and only provisionally repaired afterwards. During the Cold War era parts of the track installations were reserved for the deployment of British Forces in Berlin. The station was the Berlin terminus for the British Military Train (\"The Berliner\") which carried allied military and diplomatic passengers across the GDR to Braunschweig in West Germany. Platforms When nearby Wilmersdorfer Stra\u00dfe was converted into a pedestrian zone, a new railway underpass was built at the site of the old station hall, which was then completely demolished and rebuilt, with the replacement opening on 6 July 1971. After the East German Deutsche Reichsbahn state railway passed the West Berlin S-Bahn network to the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) public transport company, Charlottenburg Station in the early morning of 9 January 1984 was the starting point of the first BVG operated train. In 2003 the distance to the U-Bahn station Wilmersdorfer Stra\u00dfe was shortened by shifting the two S-Bahn platforms about further to the east and the opening of a new eastern entrance near the corner of the shopping street. In recent years the tracks have been equipped with noise barriers and the 1970s entrance building has been thermally refurbished. ==Train services== The station is served by the following services:Timetables for Berlin- Charlottenburg station *Regional services Magdeburg \u2013 Brandenburg \u2013 Potsdam \u2013 Berlin \u2013 F\u00fcrstenwalde \u2013 Frankfurt (Oder) (\u2013 Cottbus) *Regional services Dessau \u2013 Bad Belzig \u2013 Michendorf \u2013 Berlin \u2013 Berlin-Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport \u2013 W\u00fcnsdorf- Waldstadt *Local services Nauen \u2013 Falkensee \u2013 Berlin \u2013 Berlin-Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport *Local services Wustermark \u2013 Golm \u2013 Potsdam \u2013 Berlin *Local services K\u00f6nigs Wusterhausen \u2013 Berlin-Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport \u2013 Saarmund \u2013 Golm \u2013 Potsdam \u2013 Berlin *Berlin S-Bahn services Spandau - Westkreuz \u2013 Hauptbahnhof \u2013 Alexanderplatz \u2013 Ostbahnhof \u2013 Karlshorst \u2013 K\u00f6penick \u2013 Erkner *Berlin S-Bahn services Westkreuz - Hauptbahnhof - Alexanderplatz - Ostbahnhof - Lichtenberg - Strausberg Nord *Berlin S-Bahn services Potsdam - Wannsee - Westkreuz - Hauptbahnhof - Alexanderplatz - Ostbahnhof - Lichtenberg - Ahrensfelde *Berlin S-Bahn services Spandau - Westkreuz - Hauptbahnhof - Alexanderplatz - Ostbahnhof - Sch\u00f6neweide - Flughafen Sch\u00f6nefeld ==References== ==External links== Category:Railway stations in Berlin Category:Berlin S-Bahn stations Category:Buildings and structures in Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf Category:Railway stations in Germany opened in 1882 ",
