    "text": "Graffiti Bridge is a 1990 American rock musical drama film written, directed by, and starring Prince in his fourth and final film role. It is a standalone sequel to his 1984 film Purple Rain. Like its predecessor, it was accompanied by a soundtrack album of the same name.The Washington Post ==Plot== The plot continues with The Kid, living future life as an upbeat performer and co-owner of a club, Glam Slam, which was willed to him from Billy, who was the owner of First Avenue Club in the first film. Solitary and lovelorn, he spends his personal time composing songs, and writing letters to his deceased father. The other co-owner who was included in the will is Morris (Morris Day), his rival who now also owns his own club, Pandemonium, while desiring control of the other two clubs in the Seven Corners area, which are Melody Cool and the Clinton Club. Needing to pay the mayor of Seven Corners $10,000, Morris attempts to extort The Kid \u2013 by threatening to take full ownership of Glam Slam. Making matters more interesting is the arrival of Aura, an angel sent from Heaven to sway both Morris and The Kid into leading more righteous lives \u2013 while dealing with their attraction to her. As The Kid continues to show resistance, Morris begins to embarrass him by way of performances with his band, to steal The Kid's customers. Losing clientele and having his club defamed by Morris's henchmen, The Kid decides to challenge Morris to a music battle for ownership of Glam Slam. ==Cast== * Prince as The Kid, owner of the Glam Slam Club * Morris Day as Morris, co-owner of Glam Slam, and the Pandemonium Club * Jerome Benton as Jerome, Morris's assistant * The Time as themselves * Jill Jones as Jill, Kid's girlfriend * Mavis Staples as Melody Cool, the owner of Melody Cool Club * George Clinton as George, owner of the Clinton Club * Ingrid Chavez as Aura, an angel * Tevin Campbell as Tevin, the son of Melody Cool * Robin Power as Robin, co-owner of Glam Slam and the Pandemonium Club, who is the daughter of Billy, the owner of First Avenue Club in the first film * Rosie Gaines as a member of The Kid's band, NPG * Elisa Fiorillo as Aura's singing voice (uncredited) ==Production== According to Terry Lewis, the film was originally a vehicle for The Time, but \"in the end the story got lost and it became a Prince picture. But that was cool. I think our rapport with Prince is better now than it's ever been, because there's a mutual respect in the air ... Plus we got to hang out for six months on somebody else's budget.\" Morris Day explained: \"A sequel to Purple Rain is what it ended up being. And the role that The Time plays is, well, crooks. In Purple Rain we were small time crooks and now we've graduated to the big time. We own and control this area called Seven Corners \u2013 which is really four corners and four clubs \u2013 and everyone answers to us. It's really about the rivalry between us and The Kid (Prince), who is the picked-on, felt-sorry-for hero. But in the end he gets the girl and he beats us with a ballad. He changes our hearts and minds and makes us into good, church-going individuals with a song [laughs].\"Select, December 1990 ==Soundtrack== The film is tied into the album of the same name, which spawned the chart-making singles, \"Round and Round\" and \"New Power Generation\", as well as \"Thieves in the Temple\".
