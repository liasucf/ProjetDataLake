The first European to see the Johnston River was the surveyor, Harry Johnston, who surveyed the river in 1884. The river was named after him by another surveyor Charles William Nyulasy, in 1887. The two tributaries of the Johnston River are Fox River and Duerdin Creek. == References == Category:Rivers of Western Australia Category:Kimberley (Western Australia) ",
