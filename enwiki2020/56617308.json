It is in Khwaeng (sub-district) Wat Kanlaya of the Thon Buri District on the west bank of Chao Phraya River, in the neighbourhood known as Kudi Chin. A church was first built on the site, which had been granted to a community of Portuguese Catholics, around 1770. It was then the main Catholic church in Bangkok, and served as the seat of the Apostolic Vicariate of Siam until 1821, when Assumption Cathedral was completed. The current building, in Renaissance Revival style, was built in 1913\u20131916 to replace a second structure from 1845. ==References== * * * Category:Roman Catholic churches in Bangkok Category:Renaissance Revival architecture in Thailand Category:Portuguese diaspora in Thailand Category:ASA Architectural Conservation Award recipients Category:Unregistered ancient monuments in Bangkok Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1916 Category:Buildings and structures on the Chao Phraya River ",
