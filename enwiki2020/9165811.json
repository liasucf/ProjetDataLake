    "text": "The 1932 FA Cup Final was contested by Newcastle United and Arsenal at Wembley Stadium in what became known as the \"Over The Line\" final. Newcastle won 2\u20131, both of their goals scored by Jack Allen. Arsenal had led 1\u20130 with a Bob John goal, but Newcastle's equaliser came after a long ball that had appeared to foul over the goal line, and was put back into action for a goal kick. Newcastle winger Jimmy Richardson crossed the ball back into the field and Jack Allen levelled the match for the Magpies. The referee ruled that the ball had not gone out of play, but photographic evidence later showed that the ball had crossed the line; the goal stood. Allen scored again in the second half to win the match 2\u20131. ==Match details== {| width=92% | |- | | |} {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |colspan=\"4\"| |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- | ||1 || Albert McInroy |- | ||2 ||Jimmy Nelson (c) |- | ||3 || David Fairhurst |- | ||4 || Roddie MacKenzie |- | ||5 || Dave Davidson |- | ||6 || Sam Weaver |- | ||7 || Jimmy Boyd |- | ||8 || Jimmy Richardson |- | ||9 ||Jack Allen |- | ||10|| Harry McMenemy |- | ||11|| Tommy Lang |- |colspan=4|Manager: Andy Cunningham |- |colspan=\"4\"| |} |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=center |colspan=\"4\"| |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- | ||1||Frank Moss |- | ||2||Tom Parker (c) |- | ||3|| Eddie Hapgood |- | ||4||Charlie Jones |- | ||5|| Herbie Roberts |- | ||6|| George Male |- | ||7|| Joe Hulme |- | ||8|| David Jack |- | ||9|| Jack Lambert |- | ||10|| Cliff Bastin |- | ||11|| Bob John |- |colspan=4|Manager: Herbert Chapman |- |colspan=\"4\"| |} |} {| width=100% style=\"font-size: 90%\" | width=50% valign=top| Match rules *90 minutes. *30 minutes of extra-time if necessary. *Replay if scores still level. |} ==References== ==External links== *Match report at www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk *FA Cup Final lineups Category:FA Cup Finals FA Cup Final FA Cup Final 1932 FA Cup Final 1932 FA Cup Final FA Cup Final ",
