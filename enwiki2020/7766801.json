    "text": "is a Japanese television series that premiered on Fuji TV on New Year's Day, 1963 (a Tuesday), and is the first popular animated Japanese television series that embodied the aesthetic that later became familiar worldwide as anime. It originated as a manga of the same name in 1952 by Osamu Tezuka, revered in Japan as the \"God of Manga.\" It lasted for four seasons, with a total of 193 episodes, the final episode presented on a Saturday, New Year's Eve 1966. At its height it was watched by 40% of the Japanese population who had access to a TV. In 1964, there was a feature-length animated movie called released in Japan. It consisted of three of the cartoon episodes; The Robot Spaceship, Last Day on Earth and Earth Defense Squadron. The latter two were filmed in color. After enjoying success both in Japan and abroad as the first anime to be broadcast overseas, Astro Boy was remade in the 1980s under the name New Mighty Atom and again in 2003 as Astro Boy: Mighty Atom. == Plot == Astro Boy is set in the year 2000, forty years in the future from its original production in the 1960s. Dr Tenma, a scientist working in the Ministry of Science's Department of Precision Machinery, loses his only son, Tobio, in a car-crash. Out of grief, he orders the production of a \"super-robotic\" in Tobio's likeness. Though the robotic is the most advanced anyone has ever seen, he is not pleased with it because of the fact that it does not grow, and in a fit of rage he sells it to the circus. After this, he loses his job at the Ministry of Science and rarely appears again. He harnesses a complicated relationship towards robotics, mainly believing that they should not be treated as humans but as slaves. In the circus, where robotics exist but are a lot more primitively made than Tobio (now named Atom), they are forced to participate in fighting tournaments similar to gladiator battles. However, Atom wishes to be peaceful. Eventually, he runs into Professor Ochanomizu, the man who succeeded Dr Tenma at the head of the Ministry of Science; Ochanomizu is treated much differently than Tenma, being regarded as a savior figure by the robots for his affection and kindness towards them that Tenma did not possess. After realising how advanced Atom is compared to the rest of the other robotics, he sets him free from the circus, becoming a surrogate father figure to him. ==Characters== *Atom / Astro Boy, A robotic created and modeled upon Dr. Boynton's late son, Astor Boynton. :At first, Dr. Boynton enjoyed his company and having his son back, however he rejected the robotic after realizing he could not grow up physically like a real human child. With this, the robotic Astor was sold to the cruel circus owner, The Great Cacciatore, in order to perform in a circus and renamed as Astro. After a fire broke out during a circus show, Astro saved Cacciatore and was granted his freedom, due in part by intervention from Dr. Elefun and following the Law of Robotic Rights being passed to grant robots the ability to lead the same lives as humans. : Astro has several special powers, such as flying with rockets, super hearing, 100,000 horsepower, superhuman endurance and a machine gun which lies in his backside. :In the final episode, which aired only in Japan, Astro sacrifices himself to save the Earth while carrying a shutter which would normalize the sun, which was threatening all life on the planet.

Once he activated Astro, he was seemingly mentally better, but grew frustrated with the fact that, as a robot, Astro did not grow physically like a human child. He sold Astro off to a circus owner, the Great Cacciatore, and resigned from the Ministry and was said to have disappeared.

However, Astro manages to beat Atlas and save Dr. Ram, who realizes his mistake. == Production == According to Osamu Tezuka, the main themes of much of the manga he had created, specifically Astro Boy, were that of anti-war, the preservation of nature, and discrimination, which had emanated from his childhood experiencing the devastation of World War II. Since Mighty Atom ended up being re-written more than ten times, either due to limits on size or duration in the magazines Astro Boy was published in, instead of just simply cutting or scaling down certain parts of the manga, Tezuka would completely redraw certain panels and sections of the manga to fit and flow better with the rest of the story. This means that it is hard to define what the most original, authentic version of the story is. Also, when the manga was to be made into the anime, further revisions had to be made, including a simplifying of the story to suit the less sophisticated, wider target audience the show was aiming to appeal to. After a while, since the television company that made the series needed an output of fifty-two episodes a year, the anime quickly outpaced the manga, meaning Tezuka also had to create many original stories for the anime series that would not appear in the manga, for the purpose of filling in the gaps. ==English-language version== For the English version, the producers, NBC Enterprises settled on \"Astro Boy\" after discussions between producer Fred Ladd and representatives from NBC. Of the first 124 episodes created (there would be 193 altogether), 104 were adapted into an English-language version by Fred Ladd, and initially syndicated on U.S. TV from June 22, 1963 through June 4, 1965, with repeats continuing until the series was withdrawn from syndication in the early 1970s. The names were adjusted for American audiences. Frederik L. Schodt, who created the English version of the original comic, said that the names were \u201ccleverly\u201d changed for American tastes.Schodt, Frederik L. \"Introduction.\" Astro Boy Volume 1 (Comic by Osamu Tezuka). Dark Horse Comics and Studio Proteus. Page 3 of 3 (The introduction section has 3 pages). . In one Astro Boy manga story Tezuka expressed frustration towards the restrictions passed by American television networks on the adaptation of the newly titled Astro Boy television series.Schodt, Frederik L. \"Introduction.\" Astro Boy Volume 1 (Comic by Osamu Tezuka). Dark Horse Comics and Studio Proteus. Page 2 of 3 (The introduction section has 3 pages). . The U.S. version did not air an episode showing a dog being operated on, as the producers believed it was too cruel and grotesque to show. Tezuka criticized this as hypocrisy, as non- Japanese eat and kill animals in manners he described as \u201cgrotesque.\u201d Tezuka added that many white people in Africa shot animals for sport, yet people in England spread false rumors about Japanese people eating dogs.Tezuka, Osamu. Astro Boy Volume 1 (Comic by Osamu Tezuka). Dark Horse Comics and Studio Proteus. 34-35. . In 2007, 2008, and 2009, Cartoon Network broadcast and webcast NBC's syndicated edition of the original 1960s episodes as a part of its late night Adult Swim line-up. Only the first 52 episodes were aired. The Right Stuf International and Madman Entertainment have recently released the entire dubbed series on DVD in two box sets. The Right Stuf sets also include episodes 1, 20, 34, 56, and 193 in Japanese with English subtitles, a behind- the-scenes film, and an interview with Fred Ladd. For Right Stuf Inc. Home Entertainment's region 1 Ultra Collector's Edition DVD releases of dubbed episodes of the original 1963 series, the original English masters were destroyed in 1975, due to Tezuka's Mushi Productions filing for bankruptcy. Fortunately, Right Stuf found the best surviving voice track elements and combining them with picture quality from the original Japanese negatives. ==Reception== Astro Boy was initially very popular, being the first Japanese animated television series to make it to U.S. televisions, with the highest ratings of any show at the time. However, its popularity eventually declined to the point where only 104 of the 193 original episodes were released in the U.S., the reasons being mainly that it was still in black and white when most television sets were switching to color and many of the storylines were considered too violent and depressing for the mainstream audience. It was named the 86th best animated series by IGN, calling it the first popular anime television series. In February 2004, Cinefantastique listed the anime as one of the \"10 Essential Animations\", citing the show's \"dark themes and Tezuka's use of sci-fi as a conduit to address such issues as war and intolerance.\" ==References== Notes ==External links== * Category:Astro Boy Category:1963 Japanese television series debuts Category:1963 American television series debuts Category:1966 Japanese television series endings Category:1976 American television series endings Category:Japanese children's animated action television series Category:Japanese children's animated adventure television series Category:Japanese children's animated science fantasy television series Category:Japanese children's animated superhero television series Category:Fuji TV original programming Category:Animated television series about robots Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States Category:Television series set in the future Category:Mushi Production Category:Osamu Tezuka anime Category:Androids in television Category:Television series set in 2000 ",
