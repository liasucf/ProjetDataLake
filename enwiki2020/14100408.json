    "text": "The Burnt River is a U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed May 3, 2011 tributary of the Snake River in eastern Oregon, United States. It enters the Snake near Huntington, Oregon, at a point upstream of the Powder River and downstream of the Malheur River, slightly more than from the Snake's confluence with the Columbia River. Draining , it flows predominantly west to east. The river begins at Unity Reservoir at the confluence of the North, West, Middle, and South forks of the river. The reservoir is slightly east of the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest in the Blue Mountains and slightly north of Unity. Unity Lake State Recreation Site adjoins the reservoir. As it leaves the lake, the river flows under Oregon Route 245, then runs east through the upper Burnt River Valley past Hereford and Bridgeport and, through the Burnt River Canyon, to Durkee. Turning generally south at Durkee, the river runs along Interstate 84 past Weatherby, Dixie, and Lime before flowing under the Interstate and turning east again. Shortly thereafter, it passes Huntington and reaches the Snake. ==See also== * List of rivers of Oregon * List of longest streams of Oregon ==References== Category:Rivers of Oregon Category:Rivers of Baker County, Oregon Category:Tributaries of the Snake River ",
