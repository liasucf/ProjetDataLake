    "text": "Mexican Air Force Beechcraft T-34A Mentor (201) during TICO Airshow 2010 Space Coast Regional Airport is in Titusville, Florida on Columbia Boulevard (State Road 405) and Washington Avenue (U.S. 1) in Brevard County. Formerly known as Ti-Co (Titusville-Cocoa) Airport, it is the nearest commercial airport to the Kennedy Space Center. == History == In 1943 the U.S. Government built the airport on land jointly owned by both cities, Titusville and Cocoa. The airfield had two x runways with a taxiway system. The U.S. Government developed the airport to serve as an outlying field (OLF) to Naval Air Station Sanford during World War II. The airport was built by the Civil Aeronautics Administration under the \"Development of Landing Areas for National Defense\" Program to help relieve other area military bases of training exercises during World War II. The government retained control of the airport for the duration of the war. After the war the U.S. Navy transferred the airport and associated improvements to the War Assets Administration, which deeded the airport back to the Cities of Titusville and Cocoa by a Surrender of Lease and Quit Claim Deed dated April 18, 1947. An airport authority was established by the Cities of Titusville and Cocoa to own, operate, improve, and maintain the airport. The property was transferred to the authority by Quit Claim Deeds from the City of Titusville on March 14, 1961 and from the City of Cocoa on April 11, 1961. Having previously used military facilities on nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) began development of its own civilian manned launch facilities, in what became the John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC), on Merritt Island in the early 1960s. The location of this regional airport made it important to the transportation of NASA personnel and equipment. Eastern Airlines 727s and DC-9s stopped at Titusville from 1970 to 1974. ==Creation of Airport District== The \"Titusville-Cocoa Airport District Act of 1963\" created the Titusville-Cocoa Airport District and the Titusville-Cocoa Airport Authority (\"Authority\") to govern the operations of the airport facilities. The Authority was created to service the local, commercial, and corporate aviation needs as well as to stimulate economic growth in the local communities. The Authority replaced the original airport authority established in 1959. This legislation commissioned the Authority to govern the affairs of the Airport District. This currently includes Space Coast Regional Airport, Arthur Dunn Airpark, and Merritt Island Airport. The 1963 Act established policies for the funding of Authority activities, including an ad valorem tax not to exceed one mil on all taxable properties within the geographical bounds of the District. Also included was the authorization of the District to issue general obligation bonds and revenue bonds to finance the acquisition, construction, or development of airport property or facilities. ==Current Airport Authority== The Titusville- Cocoa Airport Authority now has seven members. Two are appointed from Brevard County election Districts I, II, and IV, and one is appointed at-large by the Board of County Commissioners of Brevard County. The Authority exercises hiring and oversight responsibility for the Authority's Executive Director, a full-time civil servant airport executive who has day-to-day responsibility for the operation, maintenance and supervision of Space Coast Regional Airport, Merritt Island Airport, Arthur Dunn Airpark and associated airport staff personnel. == Facilities == Space Coast Regional Airport covers and has two runways: * Runway 18/36 Asphalt * Runway 9/27 Asphalt ==Warbird Museum== The Valiant Air Command is a frequently flyable collection of planes used in World Wars I & II.Valiant Air Command It is based here, along with a permanent collection of additional aircraft from the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Cold War and the first Gulf War/Operation Desert Storm at the Valiant Air Command Warbird Museum.VALIANT AIR COMMAND WARBIRD MUSEUM - Titusville Florida The museum provides an exhibit of air history, offering a static display of vintage Warbird aircraft, including a Douglas C-47A.
