    "text": "{| |} RFA Black Ranger (A163) was a British diesel-powered fleet support tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, built by Harland & Wolff at their yard in Govan. On 27 February 1941, shortly after her commissioning, she was involved in a collision with the French destroyer Mistral. Mistral sustained minor damage and Black Ranger spent a short period under repair on the Clyde. Black Ranger later served with the Arctic Convoys, and was involved in a collision with the submarine in November 1960. Her role was to refuel RAF flying boats, and carried 2,600 tons of fuel oil, 550 tons of diesel, and 90 tons of petroleum. She was retired from service in 1973 and put up for sale. Bought by Greek owners, she was renamed Petrola XIV in 1973, and then Petrola 14 in 1976. ==References== ==External links== *https://web.archive.org/web/20070929133927/http://www.btinternet.com/~warship/Postwar/RFA/ranger.htm Category:Ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Category:Ships built in Govan Category:1940 ships Category:Ships built by Harland and Wolff ",
