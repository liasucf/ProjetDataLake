It is called paracompact because it has infinite vertex figures, with all vertices as ideal points at infinity. With Schl\u00e4fli symbol {3,3,3,4,3}, it has three 5-orthoplexes around each cell. It is dual to the 24-cell honeycomb honeycomb. == Related honeycombs== It is related to the regular Euclidean 4-space 16-cell honeycomb, {3,3,4,3}, with 16-cell (4-orthoplex) facets, and the regular 4-polytope 24-cell, {3,4,3} with octahedral (3-orthoplex) cell, and cube {4,3}, with (2-orthoplex) square faces. == See also == * List of regular polytopes == References == *Coxeter, Regular Polytopes, 3rd. ed., Dover Publications, 1973. .
