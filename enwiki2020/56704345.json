    "text": "The statue of Saint Volodymyr in Holland Park, London, is a work of 1988 by the Canadian-Ukrainian sculptor Leo Mol. The bronze statue stands on the corner of Holland Park and Holland Park Avenue. It was unveiled on 29 May 1988, to commemorate the 1,000th anniversary of the Christianisation of Kievan Rus'. Later that year, another statue of Volodymyr by the same sculptor was erected in Rome. Vladimir is anachronistically represented \"Ruler of Ukraine\", according to the inscription on the pedestal. In fact, the term Ukraine is encountered in the historical sources only since the end of XII century (namely, first time in the Hypatian Codex, 1187). ==See also== * Saint Vladimir Monument in Kyiv * Monument to Vladimir the Great in Moscow ==References== ==Bibliography== * Category:Statues in London Category:Buildings and structures in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Category:Cultural depictions of Vladimir the Great Category:1988 sculptures Category:1988 establishments in England Category:1988 in London Category:Holland Park ",
