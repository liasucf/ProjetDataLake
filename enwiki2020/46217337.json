    "text": "Henry Thomas Oxnard (June 23, 1860 \u2013 June 8, 1922) was a French-born, American entrepreneur and namesake of the City of Oxnard and its Henry T. Oxnard Historic District. Oxnard was president of both the American Beet Sugar Company (which later changed its name to American Crystal Sugar Company) and the American Beet Sugar Association, which represents all the beet sugar factories in the United States. He and his brothers controlled five sugar factories in the United States. ==Background== In 1860 Oxnard's French-born father sold his sugar cane plantations and refinery in Louisiana, and by doing so was able to escape the business risks of the American Civil War by returning to his native France where Henry was born in Marseilles the year before the Civil War started.http://snaccooperative.org/ark:/99166/w62j6x1v The family returned to the United States where Henry Oxnard would grow up in Massachusetts and attend Harvard College. In 1889, Oxnard and his associates established a sugar refinery in Grand Island, Nebraska. In 1891, two more plants were built in Chino, California and Norfolk, Nebraska. In 1900, Henry Oxnard married Marie Pichon with whom he had two daughters, Adeline (1901) who was named for her paternal grandmother, and Nadine (1903). ==Thoroughbred horse racing== Henry Oxnard raced Thoroughbred horses under the nom de course Albemarle Stable. In 1902 he hired future Hall of Fame inductee R. Wyndham Walden to train his stable of horses. In 1903 Henry Oxnard purchased the 517 acre Blue Ridge Farm in Upperville, Virginia where he established a Thoroughbred breeding operation. In 2006, the farm was designated for its historical significance by the Virginia Landmarks Register and the National Register of Historic Places. Many involved in the horse racing industry were greatly harmed by the 1908 Hart\u2013Agnew Law which led to the closing of all racing in New York state in 1911 and 1912. A February 21, 1913 ruling by the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division saw horse racing return in 1913. Prior to the restart, in April Henry Oxnard and other wealthy industry leaders created the \"Owners Fund\" to cover losses for 1913 and 1914 incurred by those less fortunate who might need financial assistance while attempting to get back on their feet again. ==Death== Henry Oxnard died on June 8, 1922 in New York City. ==References== ===Sources=== * * * * Category:1860 births Category:1922 deaths Category:19th-century American businesspeople Category:Businesspeople in the sugar industry Category:Sugar barons Category:American racehorse owners and breeders Category:Oxnard, California Category:People from Marseille Category:People from Massachusetts Category:Harvard College alumni ",
