Avusa means \"to rouse feelings, to revive and evoke action\". The name was changed in 2007 in order to avoid confusion between Johnnic Communications and Johnnic Holdings. The name was changed again (to Tiso Blackstar) in 2017. In 2012, Avusa was acquired by a unit of Mvelaphanda Group and renamed Times Media Group, which was then relisted on the JSE.Avusa Investors Flout PIC to Approve Mvelaphanda Takeover In 2013, Times Media Group acquired the remaining 50% of BDFM from Pearson. == Avusa publications and services== === Magazines === * avocado (closedhttp://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/39/64559.html) * Computing SA * Elle * Financial Mail * Home Owner * Longevity (soldhttp://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/39/51198.html) * SA Mining * Soccerlife * Top Huis === Newspapers === * Business Day * Daily Dispatch * The Herald * Saturday Dispatch * The Sowetan * The Sunday Times * Sunday World * The Times * Weekend Post * Times Media community newspapers ** Algoa Sun ** Go! & Express ** Our Times ** The Rep ** Talk of the Town === Retailers === * Exclusive Books (sold) * Nu Metro Cinemas (sold) ===Publishers=== * New Holland Publishers * Mediaguide * Picasso Headline (pty) Ltd. ===Digital=== Avusa created a network of its own websites, named Times Media Live, in 2010.

As a result of the article, Gareth Cliff was the victim of many insults on social media, before releasing a statement on Facebook confronting the false allegations printed in the Sunday Times. Susan Smuts, Managing Editor of the Times, responded to Cliff's lawyer, admitting that there had been \"misinterpretations\". Cliff, via his lawyer, demanded an unreserved apology from the Times. == See also== * List of South African media * Naspers * Independent News and Media * Caxton/CTP == References == ==External links== * Official home page Category:Companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange Category:South African companies established in 2007 Category:Companies based in Johannesburg Category:Mass media companies established in 2007 ",
