    "text": "The Lima LRS-1200 was a 1,200 hp (895 kW) diesel-electric road-switcher configured with an AAR type B-B wheel arrangement mounted atop a pair of two- axle AAR Type-B road trucks, built by Lima-Hamilton in 1950. All sixteen units were built for one railroad, the New York Central. A second order was outstanding at the time of Lima-Hamilton's merger with the Baldwin Locomotive Works, but owing to insufficient time to build the locomotives before the locomotive production ceased at Lima, they were built at Eddystone, PA, as Baldwin RS-12s. Lima-Hamilton never assigned a model number to their models but referred to them by specification numbers. Model designations such as LRS-1200 were a railfan invention. Lima-Hamilton assigned A-3174 as the specification number for this particular unit. == References == * * Category:B-B locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1950 LRS-1200 Category:New York Central Railroad locomotives ",
