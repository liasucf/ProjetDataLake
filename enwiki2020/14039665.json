    "text": "Decene is an alkene with the formula . Decene contains a chain of ten carbon atoms with one double bond. There are many isomers of decene depending on the position and geometry of the double bond. Dec-1-ene is the only isomer of industrial importance. As an alpha olefin, it is used as a comonomer in copolymers and is an intermediate in the production of epoxides, amines, oxo alcohols, synthetic lubricants, synthetic fatty acids and alkylated aromatics.http://www.ineosoligomers.com/media/files/lao/LAO%20C10%20Data%20Sheet.pdf 1-Decene (Alpha Olefin C10)], ineosoligomers.com The industrial processes used in the production of dec-1-ene are oligomerization of ethylene by the Ziegler process or by the cracking of petrochemical waxes.Alfa Olefins , SIDS Initial Assessment Report In ethenolysis, methyl oleate, the methyl ester of oleic acid, converts to 1-decene and methyl 9-decenoate: : CH2=CH2 \u2192 CH3(CH2)7CH=CH2 \\+ MeO2C(CH2)7CH=CH2 Dec-1-ene has been isolated from the leaves and rhizome of the plant Farfugium japonicum and has been detected as the initial product in the microbial degradation of n-decane. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Alkenes ",
