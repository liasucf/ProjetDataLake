    "text": "Richard Daniel Tremelling (12 November 1897 \u2013 15 August 1970) was an English professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He made nearly 450 appearances in the Football League for Birmingham and Bury, including more than 300 in the First Division, and was capped for England. ==Family== His brothers Sol and Billy were also footballers, as was a fourth brother, Jack. His nephew Arthur (son of Sol) was also a footballer. ==Playing career== Tremelling was born in Newhall, Derbyshire. He first played for his local team, Langwith Colliery Junction Wagon Works, as a full back, but went in goal when they were hit by injuries. He played for Mansfield Town, and appeared for Lincoln City in wartime competition, but moved to Birmingham before league football resumed after the First World War. He went straight in as first choice goalkeeper, and remained so for eleven seasons, until Harry Hibbs took over in the 1929\u201330 season. He played a key role in the destination of the First Division title on the final day of the 1923\u201324 season. His Birmingham City side faced Cardiff City who needed a win to take the title. Cardiff were awarded a penalty but Tremelling saved Len Davies' penalty kick as the match finished 0\u20130, ensuring that Herbert Chapman's Huddersfield Town won the title by 0.024 of a goal. He won his only full cap for England on 28 November 1927, in a 2\u20131 defeat to Wales played at Turf Moor, Burnley. He moved to Bury in May 1932, but returned to Birmingham in June 1936 as assistant trainer, a position which he held for five years. After retiring from football he went into the licensed trade, at the Old Lodge Hotel in Birmingham. ==Honours== Birmingham * Football League Second Division champions: 1920\u201321 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1897 births Category:1970 deaths Category:People from Newhall, Derbyshire Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:English footballers Category:England international footballers Category:Mansfield Town F.C. players Category:Lincoln City F.C. players Category:Birmingham City F.C. players Category:Bury F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:English Football League representative players ",
