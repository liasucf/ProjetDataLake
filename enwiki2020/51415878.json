The eight group winners advance to the round of 16, while the eight runners-up advance to the play-offs, where they are joined by the eight second round winners from the Domestic Champions Path. ===Tiebreakers=== The teams are ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss). If two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria are applied in the order given to determine the rankings (regulations Article 14.03): #higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question; #superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question; #higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question; #higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question; #if, after having applied criteria 1 to 4, teams still have an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 4 are reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams in question to determine their final rankings. If this procedure does not lead to a decision, criteria 6 to 12 apply; #superior goal difference in all group matches; #higher number of goals scored in all group matches; #higher number of away goals scored in all group matches; #higher number of wins in all group matches; #higher number of away wins in all group matches; #lower disciplinary points total based only on yellow and red cards received in all group matches (red card = 3 points, yellow card = 1 point, expulsion for two yellow cards in one match = 3 points); #drawing of lots. ==Groups== The matchdays were 13\u201314 September, 27\u201328 September, 18\u201319 October, 1\u20132 November, 22\u201323 November, and 6\u20137 December 2016. Times up to 29 October 2016 (matchdays 1\u20133) were CEST (UTC+2), thereafter (matchdays 4\u20136) times were CET (UTC+1). ===Group A=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Group B=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Group C=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Group D=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Group E=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Group F=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Group G=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Group H=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ==References== ==External links== *2016\u201317 UEFA Youth League *1 ",
