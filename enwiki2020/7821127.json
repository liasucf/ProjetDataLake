    "text": "The entrance to Annabel's The entrance to Annabel's (left, with doorman) in 2014 44 Berkeley Square, first home of the Clermont Club, a gambling club. Today the basement is the location of Annabel's Annabel's was a London nightclub, located at 44 Berkeley Square, London. It was founded by entrepreneur Mark Birley and named after Lady Annabel Vane-Tempest-Stewart, then his wife. It closed in 2018. Annabel's was founded in 1963, after Birley's friend John Aspinall decided that they needed somewhere to party after an evening's gambling. As a result, Birley turned the basement of Aspinall's casino, the Clermont Club, into a nightclub, and named it after his then wife, Annabel, who went on to marry Birley's friend, Sir James Goldsmith. Birley later blocked off the private staircase linking the Clermont above. Annabel's was a members-only nightclub and catered to an exclusive clientele, including the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, Princess Anne, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, US President Richard Nixon, Aristotle Onassis and Frank Sinatra. In 2003, the Queen visited the club, and it is thought to be the only nightclub the Queen has ever attended. Entertainers who have played there include Tina Turner, Ray Charles, Ella Fitzgerald, Diana Ross, Bryan Ferry and Lady Gaga. The sumptuous interior which was originally designed by Birley and designer Nina Campbell, was later updated by Birley's daughter, India Jane, but the paintings from Birley's collection remained. ==New ownership== On 5 June 2007, after more than a year of negotiations, Annabel's was acquired by Richard Caring, a clothing tycoon and owner of The Ivy restaurant, in a deal thought to be worth \u00a390 million. The deal also included the purchase of three other nightclubs including Mark's Club. The original Annabel's closed its doors in 2018. A successor day and night club was opened in a building nearby with a different membership. ==See also== * Superclub ==References== ==External links== *Annabel's official website Category:Nightclubs in London Category:Tourist attractions in the City of Westminster Category:1963 establishments in England Category:Grade I listed buildings in the City of Westminster Category:Grade I listed houses ",
