    "text": "There were 30 tropical cyclones in the western Pacific Ocean in 1931, including 19 typhoons, as well as one that developed in December of the previous year. The most significant typhoon was one that struck eastern China near Shanghai in the midst of the country's worst floods on record; heavy rainfall caused levees to collapse along the Grand Canal, killing an estimated 300,000 people, including about 2,000 people overnight in the city of Gaoyou. ==Storms== ===January-July=== On December 30, a tropical cyclone formed south of Guam and proceeded westward. A day later, the system passed near Yap. On January 2, the typhoon moved through the southern Philippines, crossing Leyte, the Camotes Islands, northern Cebu, northern Negros Island, and central Panay. While the storm was nearby, Dumalag, Capiz recorded a minimum pressure of . Winds in Cebu reached . The typhoon weakened in the South China Sea on January 5-6\\. Across the archipelago, the typhoon sank two ships, left thousands homeless, and killed at least 31 people. Damage in the Philippines totaled about 6 million pesos, spurring the Governor-general to ask residents for money for a special typhoon fund. The American Red Cross donated about 20,000 pesos to assist in recovery.https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAY550.pdfhttps://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi- bin/cdnc?a=d&d;=MT19310106.2.8&e;=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1 A depression formed northwest of Guam on May 6\\. It moved generally northward, passing west of the Bonin Islands before curving to the northeast. It was last observed on May 8. A typhoon formed in the South China Sea on June 4\\. It moved to the north-northeast and passed near the east coast of Taiwan. The storm crossed the northern Ryukyu Islands and was last observed on June 9. Another typhoon formed in the East China Sea on June 11\\. The storm moved in a general northeast direction, passing over the northern Ryukyu Islands. It was last observed on June 14. A tropical cyclone originated in the South China Sea on July 10\\. A day later, the storm moved over southeastern China. Another tropical cyclone was first observed over the open Pacific on July 16\\. It moved to the northwest and struck eastern China near Shanghai; it was last noted on July 18. A depression existed east of the Philippines on July 29\\. Steered by a ridge to the north over Japan, the system moved northwestward, brushing the northern tip of Luzon before entering the South China Sea. Early on August 1, a station in the Pratas Islands recorded a minimum pressure of 988 mbar (29.17 inHg) while the typhoon passed nearby. As the storm approached southeastern China, the Hong Kong Observatory issued a Number 10 warning signal, which is the highest level of warning; this marked the first occasion that the agency issued a Number 10 warning since adopting a new system in the previous year. Late on August 1, the typhoon made landfall between Hong Kong and Macau, and weakened over land by the next day. High waves damaged the end of the first Queen's Pier, and sank four ships. Wind gusts in the colony reached 218 km/h (136 mph). The high winds destroyed the roofs of several buildings, completely wrecking four homes. There were six deaths in Hong Kong, as well as four injuries.http://www.atms.unca.edu/ibtracs/ibtracs_v04r00/index.php?name=v04r00-1931210N12133https://www.hko.gov.hk/publica/gen_pub/WeatheringTheStorm-2.pdf ===August=== From August 3-5, a short-lived tropical cyclone existed south of Japan; the storm moved northwestward toward the Ryukyu Islands before recurving to the northeast.http://www.atms.unca.edu/ibtracs/ibtracs_v04r00/index.php?name=v04r00-1931215N17132 A typhoon was first observed on August 5 south of Guam. The storm moved to the west and later northwest, recurved to the northeast, and then turned back to the northwest, steered by a ridge to its north. The track brought the typhoon over the southern Ryukyu Islands, where the typhoon wrecked about 10,000 houses, decimated crops, and killed 15 people. Ishigaki Island recorded a minimum pressure of 986 mbar (29.11 inHg). The typhoon then passed north of Taiwan, producing estimated winds of 160 km/h (100 mph). The storm struck mainland China between Fuzhou and Wenzhou on August 11, eventually weakening over Guizhou province in central China. The schooner 'Kwongsang, bound from Shanghai to Shantou, foundered in the typhoon with 57 people onboard, and only four survivors. Several other ships were damaged.http://www.atms.unca.edu/ibtracs/ibtracs_v04r00/index.php?name=v04r00-1931219N17131https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/48719610https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/83891063https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/181276067 From August 7-12, a low pressure area persisted in the South China Sea, bringing heavy rainfall to the Philippines. Over a nine day period, the system dropped of rainfall in Manila, which caused the worst flooding in the city in 26 years, in conjunction with above normal tides. This left around 4,000 people homeless. The system moved northward through the South China Sea and began intensifying on August 12\\. Three days later, the system strengthened into a typhoon and passed near Pratas, which recorded a minimum pressure of 986 mbar (29.13 inHg). On August 17, the typhoon moved ashore southern China between Hong Kong and Shantou, and gradually weakened over land, dissipating by August 20. On August 9, a tropical cyclone began developing between the Caroline Islands and the Marianas Islands. For several days, the track was uncertain, until a more steady northwest trajectory began on August 15\\. The storm crossed the Ryukyu Islands on August 17, and later turned to the northeast in the Yellow Sea. The storm moved across the Korean Peninsula, and dissipated on August 19. ====Shanghai typhoon==== A tropical cyclone began developing between Yap and Guam on August 14\\. It drifted northward initially, and later began a west-northwest track on August 19\\. The typhoon curved back to the northwest, striking Okinawa on August 24\\. A station in Naha recorded a minimum pressure of 963 mbar (28.50 inHg). After crossing the East China Sea, the typhoon curved to the north and struck China's east coast near Ningbo on August 25\\. The storm passed east of Shanghai, bringing estimated winds of 160 km/h (100 mph) to the city. The SS President Cleveland rode out the typhoon along the Huangpu River, and recorded a pressure of 966 mbar (28.53 inHg). After affecting China, the typhoon recurved to the northeast, moving across the Yellow Sea, the northern Korean peninsula, the Sea of Japan, and eventually the La P\u00e9rouse Strait. The typhoon was last observed on August 28. In Shanghai, high winds knocked down hundreds of trees. Ahead of the typhoon, heavy rainfall across China led to the deadliest floods worldwide in the 20th century, with large areas flooded along the country's major rivers. On August 26, wind-generated waves from the typhoon broke the walls of the levees along Lake Gaoyou. There were 15 breaks in levees along the Grand Canal, inundating a portion of northern Jiangsu, including 80 towns, killing 300,000 people, according to contemporaneous news reports. In the city of Gaoyou, the levee break killed 2,000 people in the middle of the night.
