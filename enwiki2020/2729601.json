It is part of the Krifast system, the town of Kristiansund's road connection to the mainland. The bridge cost . ==Construction== Floating bridge/pontoon bridge construction has a long history in military and civilian applications on every continent except Antarctica. According to the engineers who designed this bridge, it was designed using recent American technology for floating bridges, combined with Norwegian technology for offshore platforms. The bridge designers researched other bridges in the world and traveled to the state of Washington in the United States to visit the Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge and the Hood Canal Bridge--two floating bridges. The continuous floating concrete structure used in the Washington bridges was ultimately ruled out in favor of the discrete floating concrete pier design. This design afforded: 1) an elevated roadway that reduced traffic hazards in storms, 2) a reduction in corrosion of the bridge deck, and 3) improved passage of water beneath the bridge thereby supporting native species. ==See also== *List of bridges in Norway *List of bridges in Norway by length *List of bridges *List of bridges by length *Gjemnessund Bridge *Straumsund Bridge ==References== Category:Bridges in M\u00f8re og Romsdal Category:Bridges completed in 1992 Category:Pontoon bridges Category:Gjemnes Category:Tingvoll Category:1992 establishments in Norway Category:European Route E39 in Norway Category:Norwegian National Road 70 ",
