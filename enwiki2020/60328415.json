    "text": "Dangerous Hero: Corbyn's Ruthless Plot for Power is a 2019 biography of British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn written by British conservative writer, investigative journalist and biographer Tom Bower. It is an unfriendly portrait of Corbyn. ==Reception== Peter Oborne of Middle East Eye writes the \"new book on Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, contains numerous falsehoods. It systematically omits relevant facts\" and that \"Again and again he [the author] withholds relevant information\". Stephen Bush of The Guardian criticised the book as a \"hatchet job, it is a dismal failure\" and said it committed \"rudimentary errors\". A Labour Party spokesman stated it was \u201cpoorly researched and tawdry hatchet job . . . packed with obvious falsehoods and laughable claims.\u201d The Times called it \"a bit of a bore\". The Canary called it an \"utter sham\". Matthew Norman of The Independent states, \"The only \u2018dirt\u2019 investigative journalist Tom Bower managed to dig up was the Labour leader\u2019s domestic amnesia and proneness to debt through helping those in need\" and that the book \"appears to contain a fatal paradox: on the one hand, as hinted by the subtitle Corbyn\u2019s Ruthless Plot for Power, [Corbyn] has plotted ruthlessly for power; on the other, the author reports that Corbyn was on the brink of retiring to Wiltshire to keep bees\". VICE News stated that the book is \"garbage\" and full of factual errors. According to journalist Gaby Hinsliff, who describes the book as flawed, there is little that is new in the book because \"We all know by now about the meetings with Holocaust deniers and perpetrators of blood libel, the somersaults turned to avoid blaming the Kremlin for the Salisbury poisonings, the long history of antipathy to the EU.\" The most \"telling criticism,\" in Hinsliff's view, is that \"Corbyn is simply not very bright... His backbench career was long on expressing passionate solidarity with causes but short on concrete achievements, and he comes across as prone to ducking arguments that he lacks the skill to win.\" She argues that the book's greatest flaw is Bower's eagerness to condemn its subject, but concludes that Dangerous Hero, \"is the most compelling in-depth study so far of a man whose head is unusually difficult to get inside, given his suspicion of anyone who isn\u2019t a fellow traveller.\" Ex Labour MP Tom Harris writes that the book is a \"meticulous and highly readable account\", that \"stands as an indictment of both the Labour Party and a political system that allows an individual such as Jeremy Corbyn to come within shouting distance of the levers of power in the UK\". A reviewer for The Times wrote that according to the book, the October 1968 Rodney riots in Kingston, Jamaica convinced Corbyn to become a Trotskyist with the goal of turning Britain into a communist state. ==Libel case== In June 2020, it was announced that Associated Newspapers, the publishers of The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, paid substantial damages and costs over a \u201cgrotesque\u201d libel made against a non- profit Palestinian refugee group in its serialisation of the book. Lawyers for the plaintiff, the Palestinian Return Centre, said: \u201cNeither Mr Bower, the Mail nor Harper Collins (the publisher of the book) saw fit to properly verify the true position, nor to put the allegation to the PRC prior to publication.\u201d The news outlets have also published a correction and apology. Harper Collins and Bower had already withdrawn the allegation, explaining that the author had relied on a contemporaneous newspaper report of the incident that had not been amended or corrected. ==References== Category:2019 non-fiction books Category:Biographies about politicians Category:Books by Tom Bower Category:Jeremy Corbyn Category:William Collins, Sons books ",
