    "text": "Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber was a county constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1983 to 1997. It elected one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first-past-the-post system of election. ==History== Throughout the 1983 to 1997 period, this marginal constituency was represented by a Liberal, and then Liberal Democrat, MP: Sir David Russell Johnston (later Baron Russell-Johnston), who had been, previously, MP for the Inverness constituency. == Boundaries == The constituency was created to cover four of the eight districts of Highland local government region: the Inverness district, the Nairn district, the Lochaber district and the Badenoch and Strathspey district. The region and districts had been created in 1975, under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, when the county and burgh system of local government was abolished. The other districts of the region were covered by the Ross, Cromarty and Skye constituency and the Caithness and Sutherland constituency. In 1996, under the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994, the districts were abolished and the region became a unitary council area. In 1997, constituency boundaries were redrawn to divide the Highland area between three new constituencies: Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber, Ross, Skye and Inverness West and Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross. New constituency boundaries divided the areas of some of the former districts. == Members of Parliament == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Event!!Member!!Party |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1983 | rowspan=\"2\"| Russell Johnston | Liberal |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1988 | Liberal Democrat |- | |1997 |colspan=\"2\"| constituency abolished: see Inverness East, Nairn & Lochaber and Ross, Skye & Inverness West '' |} == Election results == Inverness election history ===Elections in the 1980s=== ===Elections in the 1990s=== In the 1992 election, the four major parties were separated by only 3.41%, the closest four-way result in an election to the UK Parliament since 1918. == References == Category:Historic parliamentary constituencies in Scotland (Westminster) Category:United Kingdom Parliamentary constituencies established in 1983 Category:United Kingdom Parliamentary constituencies disestablished in 1997 Category:Highland constituencies, UK Parliament (historic) ",
