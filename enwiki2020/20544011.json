The parapodia are also edged in white, sometimes with a continuous white line but often with a broken line. There is usually a broad white band across the front of the head-shield, and there is a yellow or orange edge to the antero-lateral lobes. The eyes are situated on the inside edge of the lateral lobes, in a translucent area devoid of black pigment. The patch often appears blue.Mariaglaja inornata ==Classification== Originally described in the genus Chelidonura, this species is now placed in the genus Mariaglaja based on molecular phylogenetic results.Zamora-Silva, A. & M.
