    "text": "Bethany College is a private, liberal arts college in Bethany, West Virginia. Founded in 1840 by Alexander Campbell of the Restoration Movement, who gained support by the Virginia legislature, Bethany College was the first institution of higher education in what is now West Virginia. ==History== A liberal arts college, Bethany was chartered on March 2, 1840, by the Virginia legislature and given \"all degree-granting powers\" of the University of Virginia. West Virginia's secession from Virginia on June 20, 1863, recognized existing Virginia charters; Bethany College continues to operate under the Virginia charter. It was founded by Alexander Campbell, a minister in the Restoration Movement who provided the land and funds for the first building and served as the first president. Bethany has been a four-year private liberal arts college affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), since its inception. This religious body, of which Campbell was one of the principal founders, continues to support and encourage the college but exercises no sectarian control. An early center of coeducation, Bethany has admitted women since the 1880s. The college's roots stem from the Buffalo Seminary, founded in 1818, by Campbell; sessions were first held in his mansion in Bethany, home of Alexander Campbell and his father Thomas Campbell. The new Buffalo Seminary, \" a continuing education arm of the College\" is less than a mile away from the College. Images of Bethany College, 1904 The college is the birthplace of Delta Tau Delta, an international social fraternity founded in 1858. During World War II, Bethany was one of 131 colleges nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to a Navy commission. A number of campus buildings are contributing resources to the Bethany Historic District. The Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Pendleton Heights was listed in 1975 and the Delta Tau Delta Founders House in 1979. The campus is also home to the Parkinson Forest, which in 2019 was added to the national Old-Growth Forest Network. The designation identifies the Parkinson Forest as the oldest Old-Growth Forest in Brooke County. ==Academics== Bethany College offers a wide selection of studies, awarding Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts degrees in more than 25 fields. If a major does not appeal to a student, Bethany offers students the opportunity to design their own major through the Interdisciplinary program. Bethany also offers Dual Majors, which is a combination of two majors. According to recent research, 95% of Bethany College graduates carry student loan debt, averaging $25,704. The endowment fund in 2016 was worth $46.7 million.https://www.usnews.com/best- colleges/bethany-college-west-virginia-3808 According to U. S. News tuition and fees are $28,444 and room and board costs $10,270 (2017\u201318). About 29% of Bethany students graduate in four years. ==Student life== ===Athletics=== Bethany completes in intercollegiate athletics at the NCAA Division III level and is a member of the Presidents' Athletic Conference (PAC) and the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC).

Additionally,men can play baseball,football, and lacrosse and women can play softball and volleyball. The men's soccer team won the NCAA Division III Men's Soccer Championship in 1994. The Bison defeated Johns Hopkins, 1\u20130, in double overtime for their first and only NCAA title. In doing so, Bethany became the smallest college in the United States to win an NCAA championship. The winning goal was scored by Pat Ricci and was assisted by Steve Lindquist. Malleh Sallah was named the NCAA Goalkeeper of the Year and a First Team All- American. The team was coached by John Cunningham, who led the team from 1968 to 2001 and never had a losing record. ===Greek life=== Fraternities and sororities constitute important social groups for upperclass-men and -women on campus. Members of the four social fraternities and three sororities constitute approximately forty percent of the student body. Representatives from each serve on agencies which coordinate fraternal affairs and activities. Social fraternities represented are Delta Tau Delta (which was founded at Bethany in 1858), Alpha Sigma Phi, Beta Theta Pi, and Phi Kappa Tau. Sororities are Alpha Xi Delta, Phi Mu, and Zeta Tau Alpha. The co-ed national service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega was granted a charter at Bethany in 2004. Members of Alpha Phi Omega are permitted to join social fraternities or sororities. ==Campus== Bethany's 1,300-acre campus is in the northern panhandle of West Virginia, on the hilly Allegheny Plateau.
