    "text": "Aamiq or Aammiq II is an archaeological site southwest of Zahle in the Aammiq Wetland, Beqaa Valley, Lebanon. It was first excavated by Jacques Cauvin in 1963, then again by M. Cavalier in 1964, 1965 by Lorraine Copeland and Peter Wescombe and Jacques Besan\u00e7on & Francis Hours in 1971.Hours, F., Copeland, L., Aurenche, O., Les industries pal\u00e9olithiques du Proche Orient, essai de correlation. IV. \u00c9pipal\u00e9olithique, L'Anthropologie, 77, 437-496, 1973. Two periods of inhabitation were found, the first period between 12000-10200 cal. BC was Natufian or perhaps preceramic neolithic where a skeleton was found covered with red ochre. Tools with agricultural purpose included mortars, grinders and stoneware basalt pestles. Other brown flint lithics recovered include a triangle, blades, scrapers and picks, tools suggested pre-natufian occupation. A late neolithic period was also detected at around 5000-4500 cal BC (Ubaid period) similar to late neolithic Byblos.Copeland, L. Wescombe, P.J., Inventory of Stone-Age-Sites in Lebanon I & II, M\u00e9langes de l'Universit\u00e9 Saint Joseph, 41/2 & 42/1, Beirut, 1965/66. Ceramics found included some Chalcolithic sherds and lithics included Canaanite blades, axes and adzes, a long, polished plano-convex flint hatchet; many large flakes and blades and sickle elements. A fragment of a stalked arrow is the only trace of occupation between the periods, Chalcolithic occupation followed the older occupation at the edge of the marsh at Mallaha.Copeland, L., Natufian Sites in Lebanon in Bar-Yosef and Valla (eds.), The Natufian Culture in the Levant, 27-42, 1991. The results of a pollen core from Aamiq was published in 2008 suggesting the area was used for grazing in the neolithic while the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountains were being deforested. This is supported by Heavy Neolithic tools manufactured in specialized workshops such as Kamed el Loz I, Souwan and Wadi Ms\u0131'l el Hadd and a special design of flint called an Orange slice found at sites like Majdel Anjar I, Dakwe I and IIHabarjer III, Qaraoun I and II, Kefraya, and Be\u0131'dar Chamou't.L.
