He studied at Moscow State University, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1975 under the joint supervision of Sergei Novikov and Vladimir Arnold. Before entering the university, he had earned a gold medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad. Gusein-Zade co-authored with V. I. Arnold and A. N. Varchenko the textbook Singularities of Differentiable Maps (published in English by Birkh\u00e4user). A professor in both the Moscow State University and the Independent University of Moscow, Gusein-Zade also serves as co-editor-in- chief for the Moscow Mathematical Journal.. He shares credit with Norbert A'Campo for results on the singularities of plane curves...
