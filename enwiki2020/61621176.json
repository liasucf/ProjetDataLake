    "text": "Emilian (also Emil) Czyrnia\u0144ski (Lemko \u0415\u043c\u0456\u043b\u0438\u044f\u043d \u0427\u044b\u0440\u043d\u044f\u043d\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0456\u0439) (1824\u20131888) was a Polish chemist of Lemko descent, science writer, rector of the Jagiellonian University and co-founder of the Polish Academy of Learning. He is responsible for developing chemical nomenclature in Polish. One of his grandsons was the highly influential political activist and writer, Jozef Retinger. == Early life == Czyrnia\u0144ski was born on in Florynka, Nowy S\u0105cz County, Poland into a Lemko family. His father was the Greek Catholic parish priest and local schools inspector. After leaving school he evinced a vocation for the priesthood. He completed a preparatory theological course in Przemy\u015bl and from 1844 studied in the Theological Department of Lviv University. Within two months of starting, his studies were interrupted by a protracted illness and when he returned to Lw\u00f3w, in 1846, he was attracted by natural science and chose a new career path by moving to the German-language Technische Akademie. He proved to be a brilliant student and after only one year, in 1847 he became assistant to professor Friedrich Rochleder. == Scientific career == In 1849 Rochleder invited him to be his assistant at Charles University in Prague. There in 1850 he developed an original theory of the causes of chemical bonding which he wrote up in a paper, Wiruj\u0105ce niedzia\u0142ki (\"Swirling particles\"). In 1851 at the young age of 27 he began an independent teaching and research career when he was appointed assistant professor in chemistry in Krak\u00f3w. Soon Czyrnia\u0144ski undertook a systematisation of Polish chemical terminology which he published as S\u0142ownictwo polskie chemiczne (1853). His proposal was widely accepted by Polish research chemists. Evidence of his success was that his terminology was adopted for school textbooks in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria for close on fifty years. A volume about Lemko influence on Polish culture and science This was closely followed by his publication of Wyk\u0142ad chemii nieorganicznej zastosowanej do przemys\u0142u, rolnictwa i medycyny, (An applied inorganic chemistry manual for industry, agriculture and medicine) produced in an accessible language to explain practical applications of chemical science. In 1859 he became professor of general chemistry and pharmacy at the Jagiellonian University, and was awarded an honorary doctorate. He served there as rector from 1874 to 1875. (See Rectors of the Jagiellonian University 1817-1899) === Research === Iwonicz- Zdr\u00f3j, old sanatorium Part of his research focused on the chemical analysis of naturally occurring mineral water from the spa towns of Krynica-Zdr\u00f3j and Iwonicz-Zdr\u00f3j. As a result of his work, the medicinal trend to \"take the waters\" in those resorts grew exponentially. His other research included such areas as: * Teoryja tworzenia si\u0119 po\u0142\u0105cze\u0144 chemicznych na podstawie ruchu wirowego atom\u00f3w, (A theory of chemical bonding based on the swirling movement of atoms). 1862 * Rozwini\u0119cie krytyczne teoryi chemicznej opartej na ruchach wirowych niedzia\u0142ek, (The development of a critical theory of chemistry based on the swirling of particles). 1876 * Teoryja mechaniczno-chemiczna oparta na ruchach wirowych niedzia\u0142ek, (A mechanical-chemical theory based on the movemnt of particles). 1876 * Teoryja chemiczno-fizyczna na podstawie przyci\u0105gania si\u0119 i ruchu wirowego niedzia\u0142ek, (A physical and chemical theory based on the attraction and swirling of particles). 1884 alt=He completed a synthesis of chemical science as it stood in his day, devoting three separate textbooks to the fields of organic and inorganic chemistry: * Chemija nieorganiczna i organiczna zastosowana do przemys\u0142u, rolnictwa i l\u00e9karstwa (t. 1-2, 1866-1867) on (inorganic and organic chemistry and its applications in industry, agriculture and in pharmacies), in two volumes. 1866-67 * Chemija nieorganiczna u\u0142o\u017cona dla uniwersytet\u00f3w i akademij technicznych on (inorganic chemistry for use in universities and technical academies). 1874 * Chemija nieorganiczna mniejsza u\u0142o\u017cona dla szk\u00f3\u0142 realnych on (elements of inorganic chemistry presented for secondary schools). 1874 === Political opposition === His early years at the University were difficult as he waged a single-handed battle with the occupying Austrian authorities by insisting on taking courses in Polish and not in the prescribed German. His political stance brought him close to dismissal from his academic post. == Death == Czyrnia\u0144ski died suddenly of a heart attack on 14 April 1888 in Krak\u00f3w, three days before his daughter gave birth to his grandson, J\u00f3zef Retinger. He was buried at the Rakowicki Cemetery. == Bibliography == * * ==See also== * List of Poles ==References== Category:1824 births Category:1888 deaths Category:People from Nowy S\u0105cz County Category:People from the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria Category:Lemkos Category:Eastern Orthodox Christians from Poland Category:Polish people of Rusyn descent Category:Polish Austro-Hungarians Category:19th-century men Category:19th-century Polish people Category:Polish chemists Category:Polish organic chemists Category:Particle physicists Category:Polish scientists Category:Lviv Polytechnic alumni Category:Jagiellonian University faculty Category:Rectors of the Jagiellonian University Category:Members of the Polish Academy of Sciences ",
