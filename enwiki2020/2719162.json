Following Milongo's death in July 2007, the UDR-Mwinda held a national congress in Brazzaville on April 12-13 2008, pledging to uphold Milongo's political thought. At the congress, Guy Kinfoussia Romain, a retired military officer, was elected as President of the UDR-Mwinda; in addition, a political bureau and a 150-member national council were elected. Romain spoke on this occasion of the party's continuing opposition to the Congolese Party of Labour-led government and said that the UDR-Mwinda wanted \"to play a major role within the Alliance for the New Republic\", an opposition coalition. Along with UPADS and the Rally for Democracy and Development (RDD), the UDR-Mwinda formed the Alliance for the New Republic on May 11, 2007.\"Trois partis politiques de l'opposition cr\u00e9ent l'Alliance pour une nouvelle R\u00e9publique\", Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, May 11, 2007 .

It wanted a new and independent electoral commission, in addition to an \"all-inclusive national dialogue\" prior to the 2009 presidential election.\"Three Congolese opposition parties withdraw from electoral commission\", African Press Agency, August 14, 2008. ==References== Category:Political parties in the Republic of the Congo Category:Political parties established in 1992 Category:1992 establishments in the Republic of the Congo ",
