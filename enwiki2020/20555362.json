MacDougall (1994) to allow for the dissemination of his collection to his nephews and nieces. He added an entail though, stating that no part of the furniture or furnishings considered to be a part of the Villa Mattei should be removed so as to ensure the villa would remain as it had been while he was alive. However, future generations had the entail broken (by Pope Benedict XIV) and the villa's contents were eventually divided and sold. ==References== Category:Date of birth unknown Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Date of death unknown Category:1614 deaths C Category:Italian nobility Category:Italian art collectors ",
