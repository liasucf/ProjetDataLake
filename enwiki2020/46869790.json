During the time of Sharq al-Andalus a real (from the Arabic Riyad) was a kind of orchard or garden, with some kind of building as summer residence that used to belong to a member of Andalusian urban oligarchy, located around the cities or large farmhouses.CSIC Escuela de Estudios \u00c1rabes, La arquitectura residencial de al- Andalus: an\u00e1lisis tipol\u00f3gico, contexto urbano y sociol\u00f3gico. Bases para la intervenci\u00f3n patrimonial.Unos apuntes sobre la Granada andalus\u00ed (J. Navarro). In this sense, in other areas of Al-Andalus it is also used the word Almunia. An example would be Real Palace of Valencia, although the term Real continues within the Catalan to Arabism, present in many place names like Secar de la Real in Palma de Mallorca, the Montroy and Real de Gandia, or the same Pla del Real in Valencia. It is very common to confuse etymology with a derivative of royal or relating to the king, which is more explicit in the case of the Real Palace as it was royal residence.Etimolog\u00eda Real en catal\u00e1n. == References == Category:Culture of Al-Andalus Category:Palaces in Spain ",
