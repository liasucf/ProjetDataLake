Rahman with lyrics provided by Gulzar. ==Overview== Like many of Rahman's soundtracks, Guru comes with a variety of songs. The songs vary in their musical style, from the Turkish inspired \"Mayya Mayya\" to the folk-ish \"Ek Lo Ek Muft\", the love ballad Tere Bina and rain-themed song, \"Barso Re\". The song Tere Bina is dedicated to the memory of Pakistani qawwali singer Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan since it was the 10th anniversary of his death. Gulzar also adapted the lyrics of \"Ay Hairathe\" from the lyrics of Amir Khushroo's \"Ay Sarbathe Aashiqui\". Rahman personally trained Egyptian singer Maryem Tollar to sing \"M Mayya\", a song which Rahman wrote while on Hajj in Makkah. After he heard a man near a river who was continually repeating \"maya maya maya\" (water in Arabic), he told Gulzar to incorporate the word into the tune he had created while touring in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The soundtrack has proved a success, staying at the number one spot thirteen weeks after its release, despite receiving stiff competition from other albums released. The song \"Shauk Hai\" has been used in the movie, but was not released on the audio CD. The soundtrack release of Guru also incorporated bonus tracks from Rahman's other albums Rang De Basanti, Lagaan, Kisna, Zubeidaa and Meenaxi. ==Usage in media== The song \"Tere Bina\" was used in the 2013 American 3D computer- animated adventure sports comedy film Planes, produced by DisneyToon Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. ==Track listing== ===Hindi (Original)=== Lyrics:Gulzar === Tamil (Dubbed)=== Lyrics : Vairamuthu === Telugu (Dubbed)=== Lyrics : Veturi Sundararama Murthy ==Awards== Filmfare Awards *Won, Best Music Direction \u2013 A.
