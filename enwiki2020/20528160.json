    "text": "The Story of a Real Man () is an opera in four acts by the Russian composer Sergei Prokofiev, his opus 117.. It was written from 1947 to 1948,Nestyev, Israel V.; transl. Jonas, Florence (1961). . Stanford University Press. pp. 402\u2013404, 411, 512. . and was his last opera. The libretto, by the composer and Mira Mendelson, is based on the novel of the same name by Boris Polevoy; this in turn was based on the story of pilot Aleksey Maresyev. The opera received its premiere on 3 December 1948 at the Kirov Theatre, Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg). The audience was made up of Soviet cultural officials who gave the work a poor reception. This was a great disappointment to the composer who had intended the opera to rehabilitate his reputation with the Communist authorities after he had been accused of \"formalism\" earlier in the year. As a result, performances of The Story of a Real Man were forbidden to the general public until after Prokofiev's death. It received its public premiere on 7 October 1960 at the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow. ==Roles== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Role !Voice type !Premiere cast, closed rehearsal 3 December 1948 Conductor: Boris Khaykin Leningrad, Kirov !Bolshoi cast, public premiere 8 October 1960 Conductor: Mark Ermler Studio recording, 1961 |- | Aleksey Maresyev, pilot |baritone | | Yevgeny Kibkalo |- | Andrei Dzhegtyarenko, pilot |bass | | Georgi Pankov |- | Klaudiya Michailovna, nurse |contralto | | Kira Leonova |- | Konstantin Kukushkin, pilot |tenor | | Aleksei Maslennikov |- | Grandfather Mihailov |tenor | | Georgi Shulpin |- | Olga, Aleksey's fianc\u00e9e |soprano | | Glafira Deomidova |- | Commissar Semyon Vorobyev |baritone / bass | | Arthur Eisen |- | Sinocka |soprano | | Maria Zvenzdina |- | Varya |mezzo-soprano | | Margarita Miglau |- | Surgeon Vasilyevich |bass | | Mark Reshetin |- | Grandmother Vasilissa |contralto | | Vera Smirnova |- |} ==Synopsis== The story is set during the Second World War. Aleksey, a Soviet fighter pilot, is shot down in combat against the Germans and badly wounded. He is rescued and cared for by villagers from a collective farm before being transferred to a hospital, where both his legs are amputated. He is inspired by the thought of his girlfriend and the support of his fellow patients, one of whom tells him the story of a First World War ace who continued to fly after losing one of his legs. The opera ends with Aleksey taking to the air again in his new plane. ==Recordings== * Yevgeny Kibkalo (as Aleksey), Glafira Deomidova (as Olga). Chorus and orchestra of the Bolshoi Theatre, dir.
