He refuses, so her sister Grace (Reed) shoots and kills him. Jim O'Neil (Hughes), who has come gunning for the man for a similar reason involving his fianc\u00e9 Helen (Cheshire), is accused of the crime when he is discovered standing over the body. The police use a particularly disgusting third degree interrogation to drag a confession from the innocent man. He is brought to trial and Grace is drawn on the jury. At trial the six shooter is brandished per custom before the accused and jury with the usual effect. The circumstantial evidence convinces the eleven men on the jury that the defendant is guilty, but Grace holds out for acquittal. The judge directs that the jury be locked in for the night on Christmas Eve, and the men on the jury try to convince her of the man's guilt, but she is obdurate. Then a telegram arrives which informs her of her sister's death. Grace tells her story, and the men change their votes to \"not guilty\". ==Cast== *Florence Reed as Grace Norton *Hugh Thompson as John Schuyler *Gareth Hughes as Jim O'Neil *David Powell as Edward Knox *Florida Kingsley as Mrs. O'Neil *Mildred Cheshire as Helen *May McAvoy as Edith Norton *Harold Entwistle as The Judge *Tom McGuire as District Attorney (credited as Thomas McGuire) *Walter McEwen as Defense Attorney *Edward Brennan as Clerk of the Court *Frank De Camp as Jury Foreman *Edward Elkas as A Juror (credited as Edward Elkus) *Jane Jennings ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1919 films Category:American silent feature films Category:American films Category:Films directed by John M.
