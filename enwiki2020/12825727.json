The tournament was sanctioned by the International Baseball Federation, which titled it the Amateur World Series from the 1938 tournament through the 1986 AWS. The tournament was held, for the second time, in Taiwan (which played as Chinese Taipei), from November 6 to 18. The United States defeated Cuba in the final, winning its third title. There were 18 participating countries, split into two groups, with the first four of each group qualifying for the finals. Games were played in three cities: Taichung City (at Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium and Taichung Baseball Field); Taipei City; and Sinjhuang City. At one time, Venezuela\u2019s participation was in question due to possible sanctions to be considered by the International Baseball Federation in the wake of their refusal to grant visas to a youth team from Taichung to participate in the Youth World Baseball championships in August, 2007,IBAF strips Venezuela of baseball youth worlds over visas - Summary but they were allowed to participate. China was originally scheduled to participate in Pool B, but dropped out and was replaced by the Thai national team, who placed fifth behind China at the 2006 Asian Games. The next two competitions were also held as the BWC tournament, which was replaced in 2015 by the quadrennial WBSC Premier12. ==Group A== ===Table=== right {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Pool A |- ! Rank !
