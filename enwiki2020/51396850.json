    "text": "La Esperanza Frente a Mi is the fourth studio album recorded by American singer Danny Gokey. It is a Spanish reissue of Gokey's second studio album, Hope in Front of Me (2014). The album was released July 29, 2016 through BMG Rights Management. It was supported by the single \"Que Tu Coraz\u00f3n Vuelva a Latir\", which was released in promotion of both versions of the album. ==Content== La Esperanza Frente a Mi is a track-by-track re-recording of Hope in Front of Me, performed in the Spanish language. Gokey describes the collection as songs that \"defined his life\" and became the \"soundtrack to his mission.\" The album additionally contains a tropical remix of \"Que Tu Coraz\u00f3n Vuelva a Latir\" and a salsa remix of \"La Esperanza Frente a Mi\". Gokey was inspired to learn Spanish by his late first wife, Sophia, who was latina. He struggled with the language in high school. ==Promotion== On May 6, 2016, Gokey released an extended play containing five language-variant versions of the third single from Hope in Front of Me, titled \"Tell Your Heart to Beat Again\". The collection included the original, a Spanglish version, and a purely Spanish version titled \"Que Tu Coraz\u00f3n Vuelva a Latir\", in addition to two remixes of the original. While not promoted to the Latin American market, the original English version was a success in the Christian market. Gokey also premiered the salsa remix of the title track, \"La Esperanza Frente a Mi\", exclusively on Billboard the day before the album's release, on July 28, 2016. ==Track listing== ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !
