    "text": "This is a list of the bird species recorded in South Sudan. The avifauna of South Sudan include a total of 884 species. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for South Sudan. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in South Sudan * (E) Endemic - a species endemic to South Sudan * (I) Introduced - a species introduced to South Sudan as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions ==Ostriches== Order: StruthioniformesFamily: Struthionidae *Common ostrich, Struthio camelus ==Grebes== Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. There are 2 species which occur in South Sudan. *Little grebe, Tachybaptus ruficollis *Great crested grebe, Podiceps cristatus ==Cormorants== Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage colouration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white and a few being colourful. *Great cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo *Long-tailed cormorant, Microcarbo africanus ==Darters== Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Darters are often called \"snake-birds\" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. *African darter, Anhinga melanogaster ==Pelicans== Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Pelecanidae Pelicans are large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak. As with other members of the order Pelecaniformes, they have webbed feet with four toes. *Great white pelican, Pelecanus onocrotalus *Pink-backed pelican, Pelecanus rufescens ==Herons, egrets, and bitterns== Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Ardeidae The family Ardeidae contains the bitterns, herons and egrets. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills. *Gray heron, Ardea cinerea *Black-headed heron, Ardea melanocephala *Goliath heron, Ardea goliath *Purple heron, Ardea purpurea *Great egret, Ardea alba *Intermediate egret, Ardea intermedia *Black heron, Egretta ardesiaca *Little egret, Egretta garzetta *Squacco heron, Ardeola ralloides *Cattle egret, Bubulcus ibis *Striated heron, Butorides striata *Black-crowned night-heron, Nycticorax nycticorax *White-backed night-heron, Gorsachius leuconotus *Little bittern, Ixobrychus minutus *Dwarf bittern, Ixobrychus sturmii *Great bittern, Botaurus stellaris ==Hammerkop== Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Scopidae The hammerkop is a medium-sized bird with a long shaggy crest. The shape of its head with a curved bill and crest at the back is reminiscent of a hammer, hence its name. Its plumage is drab-brown all over. *Hamerkop, Scopus umbretta ==Shoebill== Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Balaenicipididae The shoebill is a large bird related to the storks.
