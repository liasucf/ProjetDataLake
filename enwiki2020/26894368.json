    "text": "J\u00falio Prates de Castilhos (Cruz Alta, 29 June 1860 \u2014 Porto Alegre, 24 October 1903) was a Brazilian journalist and politician, having been elected Patriarch of Rio Grande do Sul. He was elected twice as the governor of Rio Grande do Sul and was the principal author of the State Constitution of 1891 and a model for many future politicians of the region.Margaret Bakos, J\u00falio de Castilhos: Positivismo, aboli\u00e7\u00e3o e rep\u00fablica (EDIPUCRS, 2006: ), p. 9. He disseminated positivist ideas in Brazil. On July 15, 1891, Julio de Castilhos was elected president of the state of Rio Grande do Sul. However, with the November 3rd coup of Deodoro da Fonseca, he was deposed on November 3 that year. He re-ran for the same office one year later, without adversaries, and regained his old post. Less than a year later, the unsuccessful Federalist Riograndense Revolution began, with one of the rebel force's demands being his removal from power. His opposers claimed that the State Constitution granted the state governor with near-dictatorial powers. The town of J\u00falio de Castilhos, where he was born, is named after him. ==References== ==External links== Category:1860 births Category:1903 deaths Category:Governors of Rio Grande do Sul Category:Republican Party of Rio Grande do Sul politicians ",
