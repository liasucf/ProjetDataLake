It was her first Wimbledon title and her second and last Grand Slam title, having won the Australian Open earlier in the year. Mauresmo also became the first French woman to win Wimbledon since Suzanne Lenglen in 1925. With her loss, Henin-Hardenne missed the chance of completing a career Grand Slam. Venus Williams was the defending champion, but lost in the third round to Jelena Jankovi\u0107. With Serena Williams not competing due to a knee injury, it marked the first Wimbledon women's final since 1999 not to feature either of the Williams sisters. This was also the last time two women contested two major finals against one another in a single season until Serena Williams and Angelique Kerber met in the 2016 Australian Open and Wimbledon finals. Li Na became the first Chinese player (male or female) to reach a Grand Slam singles quarterfinal. This also marked the Grand Slam debut of future World No. 2 and 2012 Wimbledon finalist Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska, who reached the fourth round as a wildcard before losing to Kim Clijsters. ==Seeds== Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo (Champion) Kim Clijsters (Semifinals) Justine Henin-Hardenne (Final) Maria Sharapova (Semifinals) Svetlana Kuznetsova (Third round) Venus Williams (Third round) Elena Dementieva (Quarterfinals) Patty Schnyder (Second round) Anastasia Myskina (Quarterfinals) Nicole Vaidi\u0161ov\u00e1 (Fourth round) Francesca Schiavone (First round) Martina Hingis (Third round) Anna-Lena Gr\u00f6nefeld (First round) Dinara Safina (Third round) Daniela Hantuchov\u00e1 (Fourth round) Flavia Pennetta (Fourth round) Maria Kirilenko (First round) Ai Sugiyama (Fourth round) Ana Ivanovic (Fourth round) Shahar Pe'er (Second round) Katarina Srebotnik (Third round) Nathalie Dechy (First round) Anabel Medina Garrigues (Third round) Marion Bartoli (Second round) Elena Likhovtseva (Third round) Jelena Jankovi\u0107 (Fourth round) Li Na (Quarterfinals) Sofia Arvidsson (First round) Tatiana Golovin (Second round) Anna Chakvetadze (Third round) Gisela Dulko (Third round) Mara Santangelo (First round) ==Qualifying== ==Draw== ===Finals=== ===Top half=== ====Section 1==== ====Section 2==== ====Section 3==== ====Section 4==== ===Bottom half=== ====Section 5==== ====Section 6==== ====Section 7==== ====Section 8==== ==References== ==External links== * *2006 Wimbledon Championships on WTAtennis.com *2006 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's draws and results at the International Tennis Federation Women's Singles Category:Wimbledon Championship by year \u2013 Women's Singles Wimbledon Championships Wimbledon Championships ",
