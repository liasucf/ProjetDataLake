Finally, Lodge served two more terms in the Senate, including one year as president pro tempore in 1974, and was defeated for re-election that year. Lodge was best known for shepherding the state's no-fault auto insurance law through the Legislature, and was an opponent of both income tax and open housing. He was known to give out gold-colored cufflinks and coins with his likeness. After leaving the Legislature, workers found an oil painting of him on a wall in the State Capitol ordinarily reserved for those of past governors. Lodge served as a delegate to the 1944 Republican National Convention which nominated Michigan native Thomas Dewey for President of the United States. He was also a member of numerous civic and professional associations.The Political Graveyard: Lodge, L.
