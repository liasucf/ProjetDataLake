    "text": "Hatfield and Stainforth railway station serves the Doncaster suburbs of Hatfield and Stainforth in South Yorkshire, England. It is located north east of the main station. The original station, known until the 1990s as \"Stainforth and Hatfield\" and was built in 1866 as a replacement for the South Yorkshire Railway's Stainforth when their line was brought to its present alignment. The station was renamed Hatfield and Stainforth in the 1990s when it was considered that Hatfield was the larger of the two and had the larger population. The Doncaster Core Strategy includes support for \"refurbishment of the railway station and the creation of a rail/bus/park and ride interchange\".Doncaster Core Strategy (PDF) ==Facilities== The station is unstaffed but has a ticket machine. There are no substantial buildings remaining on the platforms other than standard waiting shelters and the fully accessible footbridge linking them to the station entrance and car park. The former station building adjacent to the entrance is still standing - the single customer help point is located on one of its outer walls. Train running information is provided by digital information screens and timetable posters.Hatfield and Stainforth station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 20 January 2017 ==Service== Monday to Saturdays there is generally a train every 30 minutes to Doncaster westbound and hourly to Hull and Scunthorpe eastbound.
