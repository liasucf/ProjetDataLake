    "text": "' (; meaning 'philosophy of life') was a dominant philosophical movement of German-speaking countries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which had developed out of German Romanticism. emphasised the meaning, value and purpose of life as the foremost focus of philosophy. Its central theme was that an understanding of life can only be apprehended by life itself, and from within itself. Drawing on the critiques of epistemology offered by Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, notable ideas of the movement have been seen as precursors to both Husserlian phenomenology and Heideggerian existential phenomenology. criticised both mechanistic and materialist approaches to science and philosophy, and as such has also been referred to as the German vitalist movement, though its relationship to biological vitalism is uncertain. Vitality in this sense is instead understood as part of a distinction between one's being () and intellect ().Note that this Klagesian use of the terms and does not translate in the same manner as typical German philosophical usage: == Overview == Inspired by the critique of rationalism in the works of Arthur Schopenhauer, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, and Friedrich Nietzsche, emerged in 19th- century Germany as a reaction to the rise of positivism and the theoretical focus prominent in much of post-Kantian philosophy.Michael Friedman, A Parting of the Ways: Carnap, Cassirer, and Heidegger, Open Court, 2013. While often rejected by academic philosophers, it had strong repercussions in the arts.Cf. Manos Perrakis (ed.), Life as an Aesthetic Idea of Music. Universal Edition, Vienna/London/New York, NY 2019 (Studien zur Wertungsforschung 61), . The movement bore indirect relation to the subjectivist philosophy of vitalism developed by Henri Bergson, which lent importance to immediacy of experience. Twentieth-century forms of can be identified with a critical stress on norms and conventions. The Israeli-American historian Nitzan Lebovic identified with the tight relation between a \"corpus of life-concepts\" and what the German education system came to see, during the 1920s, as the proper Lebenskunde, the \u2018teaching of life\u2019 or \u2018science of life\u2019\u2014a name that seemed to support the broader philosophical outlook long held by most biologists of the time. In his book Lebovic traces the transformation of the post-Nietzschean from the radical aesthetics of the Stefan George Circle to Nazi or \"biopolitical\" rhetoric and politics.Nitzan Lebovic, The Philosophy of Life and Death: Ludwig Klages and the Rise of a Nazi Biopolitics, Palgrave Macmillan, 2013. This philosophy pays special attention to life as a whole, which can only be understood from within. The movement can be regarded as a rejection of Kantian abstract philosophy or scientific reductionism of positivism. == List of notable theorists == == See also == * German Idealism, an antecedent philosophical movement to * German Romanticism, an antecedent intellectual movement to ;People indirectly associated with the Lebensphilosophie movement * Henri Bergson, notable for his studies of immediate experience * Hannah Arendt, notable for her distinction between vita activa and vita contemplativa * Pierre Hadot, notable for his conception of ancient Greek philosophy as a bios or way of life * Giorgio Agamben, notable for his zoe\u2013bios distinction == References == Category:Philosophical movements Category:German philosophy Category:Philosophy of life ",
