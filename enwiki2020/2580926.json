Pendle Hill is located 30 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government areas of Cumberland Council and City of Parramatta and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region.http://www.holroyd.nsw.gov.au/html/lcs/library/holroyd/suburbmap.htm ==History== George Bond (1876\u20131950), an American who came to Australia in 1909,Karskens, Grace. Holroyd: A Social History of Western Sydney. Kensington, New South Wales: New South Wales University Press, 1991. established a cotton spinning mill in the area in 1923. It was Australia's first attempt to spin and weave cotton from cotton farms that the company owned in Queensland. Lancashire was the centre of England's cotton industry, and Pendle Hill is a hill in the heart of the Lancashire cotton industry. It seems likely this is where the town gained its name. George Bond was originally in the business of importing hosiery and underwear but during World War I began manufacturing hosiery in Redfern and by 1925 was producing a quarter of Australia's output of hosiery and knitted garments. Bond Industries Limited became a public company in 1927. The railway station at Pendle Hill opened here on 12 April 1924. The first government school opened in 1955 and the first post office was opened in 1956 by Postmaster Sqn. Ldr.[Rtd] Richard R. Purdie M.B.E. and his wife Elsie. Nearby \"Purdie Lane\" is named after these long time pioneers of Pendle Hill.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia ==Commercial area== Pendle Hill has a large shopping centre with just over 50 specialty shops beside the railway station.

Civic Park now contains two tennis courts and a half court basketball facility. Binalong Park (also known as Binalong Oval) is a large oval in the north of Pendle Hill bordering Toongabbie. The park contains two tennis courts, four netball courts and four ovals. These both are particularly popular for sporting lessons, and weekend sporting events. The grounds are home to the Pendle Hill Tigers football club who compete in the Granville district Football Association and Pendle Hill Colts Cricket Club, who compete in the Parramatta District Cricket association, competitions at both junior and senior level. The netball courts are the training venue for Pendle Hill Netball Club Inc., who compete in the Blacktown City Netball Association competitions at junior and senior level. ==Housing== Pendle Hill has fairly steadily real-estate values that can be seen reflected in most suburbs in the Parramatta region. Recently many older houses have been bought by developers to make way for apartment blocks and flats. This is particularly the case near the train-station. The area nearby the station contains a minimal number of homes. ==References== Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:Cumberland Council, New South Wales Category:City of Parramatta Category:Hindu enclaves Category:Little Indias ",
