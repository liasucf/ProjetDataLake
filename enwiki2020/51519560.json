    "text": "Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h formally abolished the practice of slave trading among Baha\u02bcis in the Kitab-i-Aqdas (ca. 1873). The English translation of the relevant section is as follows: ::It is forbidden you to trade in slaves, be they men or women. It is not for him who is himself a servant to buy another of God's servants, and this hath been prohibited in His Holy Tablet. Thus, by His mercy, hath the commandment been recorded by the Pen of justice. Let no man exalt himself above another; all are but bondslaves before the Lord, and all exemplify the truth that there is none other God but Him. He, verily, is the All-Wise, Whose wisdom encompasseth all things. :::Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h, The Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 45) In his letter to Queen Victoria, written to her between 1868 and 1872, Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h had singled out the action of the British government in using its power to stamp out the world trade in slaves for particular commendation. ::We have been informed that thou hast forbidden the trading in slaves, both men and women. This, verily, is what God hath enjoined in this wondrous Revelation. God hath, truly, destined a reward for thee, because of this. :::(Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h, The Proclamation of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h, p. 30) In 1844, when the B\u00e1b declared his mission, slavery was still very widespread. When the B\u00e1b went on the Hajj pilgrimage in 1844, he was accompanied by Qudd\u00fas and an Ethiopian slave. The family the B\u00e1b was born into possessed several slaves: one was his first tutor, and the subject of a eulogy penned by his young pupil/master in later years, crediting him as having raised him and praises him. The B\u00e1b was martyred in 1850, at which time he had not abrogated or changed the laws of Islam that permitted and regulated the practice. Slavery was not finally abolished in Iran until 1929.On February 7, 1929 the Iranian National Parliament ratified an anti-slavery bill that outlawed slave trade or any other claim of ownership over human beings. The bill also empowered the government to take immediate action for emancipation of all slaves. For comparison though slavery had been abolished in the British Empire as late as 1833,The Slavery Abolition Act passed in 1833 abolished slavery in the British Empire on 1 August 1834 (with the exception of St. Helena, Ceylon and the territories administered by the East India Company, though these exclusions were later repealed). Under the Act, slaves were granted full emancipation after a period of 4 to 6 years of \"apprenticeship\". it remained legal in the United States until 1863.On September 22, 1862, Lincoln issued a preliminary proclamation warning that he would order the emancipation of all slaves in any state in rebellion against the Union this took effect on January 1, 1863. Nor was slavery immediately abolished among followers of the B\u00e1b and Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. The household in which Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h was raised also included a number of slaves. He became the owner of these on the death of his father, whereupon he gave each of them the choice of remaining in his service as free servants, or leaving. saying \"How, then, can this thrall claim for himself ownership of any other human being? Nay,\u2026.\" All of them chose to take up their freedom in full and leave his household, except one called Isfand\u00edy\u00e1r, who remained a loyal servant, and later a well known follower, of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. ==Partial list of slaves== *H\u00e1j\u00ed Mub\u00e1rak - purchased at the age of 5 years old by H\u00e1j\u00ed M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ab\u00fa'l-Q\u00e1s\u00edm, the great-grandfather of Shoghi Effendi and brother-in-law of the B\u00e1b, H\u00e1j\u00ed Mub\u00e1rak was sold to the B\u00e1b in 1842 at the age of 19 for fourteen tomans.
