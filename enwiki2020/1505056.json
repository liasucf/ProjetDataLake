The university is known for leading faculties and research emphasis on liberal arts and applied sciences. ==History== Jawaharlal Nehru University was established in 1969 by an act of parliament. It was named after Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister. G. Parthsarthi was the first vice-chancellor. Prof. Moonis Raza was the Founder Chairman and Rector. The bill for the establishment of Jawaharlal Nehru University was placed in the Rajya Sabha on 1 September 1965 by the then minister of education, M. C. Chagla. During the discussion that followed, Bhushan Gupta, member of parliament, voiced the opinion that this should not be yet another university. New faculties should be created, including scientific socialism, and one thing that this university should ensure was to keep noble ideas in mind and provide accessibility to students from weaker sections of society. The JNU Bill was passed in Lok Sabha on 16 November 1966 and the JNU Act came into force on 22 April 1969. The Indian School of International Studies was merged with the Jawaharlal Nehru University in June 1970. Following the merger, the prefix \"Indian\" was dropped from the name of the School and it became the School of International Studies of the Jawaharlal Nehru University. ==Recognised institutes== JNU has granted recognition and accreditation to the following institutions across the country. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+List of Defence Institutions Granted Recognition under JNU !Institution !Location |- |Army Cadet College |Dehradun |- |College of Military Engineering |Pune |- |Military College of Electronics and Mechanical Engineering |Secunderabad |- |Military College of Telecommunication Engineering |Mhow |- |National Defence Academy |Pune |- |Indian Naval Academy |Ezhimala |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+List of Business School under JNU !Institution !Established !Location |- |Atal Bihari Vajpayee School of Management and Entrepreneurship |23 August 2018 |New Delhi |} Research and Development Institutions *Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI), Lucknow *Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad *Inter-University Accelerator Centre (IUAC), New Delhi *Institute of Microbial Technology (IMT), Chandigarh *Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP), Lucknow *Raman Research Institute (RRI), Bangalore *National Institute of Immunology (NII), New Delhi *National Institute of Plant Genome Research (NIPGR), New Delhi *International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), New Delhi *Centre for Development Studies (CDS), Thiruvananthapuram *Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune *Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), Gurgaon *V. V. Giri National Labour Institute, New Delhi. In addition, the university has exchange programmes and academic collaboration through the signing of MoUs with 71 universities around the world. The University has also sent a proposal to set up a Center in Bihar. The Indian Administrative Service (IAS) trainee officers will be awarded an MA degree in Public Management from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), Delhi. ==Activism and controversy== The JNU is infused with an intense political life on campus. Students that leave campus are said to acquire a \"permanently changed outlook on life\" as a result of the student politics. The politicisation of campus life has led to a refusal to brush under the carpet social issues such as feminism, minority rights, social and economic justice. All such issues are debated fiercely in formal and informal gatherings. A sign near the JNU administrative building after the Delhi High Court ruled that students cannot hold protests within a 100-meter periphery of the university's administrative block. The JNU student politics is left-of-centre even though, in recent years, right-wing student groups have also entered the field. Political involvement is \"celebratory in spirit.\" The student union elections are preceded by days of debates and meetings, keeping all students involved. The JNU has the reputation of an \"unruly bastion of Marxist revolution.\" However, the student activists deny the charge, stating that the politics at JNU is issue-based and intellectual. Iconic statue of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru at administrative block of JNU The university is known for its alumni who now occupy important political and bureaucratic positions (see Notable alumni below). In part, this is because of the prevalence of Left-Centric student politics and the existence of a written constitution for the university to which noted Communist Party of India leader Prakash Karat contributed exhaustively during his education at JNU.The Indian Express, \u2018Difficult to adapt to life outside JNU\u2019 ===1981 46 days lockdown=== JNU was shutdown for 46 days by Indian government in 1981 after violence by student unions linked to communist parties. === 2000 Army Officers Scuffle === In April 2000, two army officers who disturbed an Indo-Pak mushaira at the JNU campus were beaten up by agitated students. The officers were angered by anti- war poems recited by two Pakistani poets and disrupted the . They were enraged at the recited lines of a poem by progressive Urdu poetess, Fahmida Riaz (\"It turned out you were just like us\") and interpreted the lines as a criticism of India. One of them started to shout anti-Pakistan slogans. When the audience asked for silence. They were overpowered by security and then beaten by students, though not seriously injured. The Indian Army denied the charges and it was reported that the two army officers were admitted in hospitals. A retired judge was appointed to probe the accusation. === 2008-12 Ban on Student Elections === On 24 October 2008 the Supreme Court of India stayed the JNU elections and banned the JNUSU for not complying with the recommendations of the Lyngdoh committee. After a prolonged struggle and multi-party negotiations, the ban was lifted on 8 December 2011. After a gap of more than four years, interim elections were scheduled again on 1 March 2012. Following the election results declared on 3 March 2012, All India Students Association (AISA) candidates won all four central panel seats and Sucheta De, the president of AISA became the president of JNUSU. === 2010 Operation Green Hunt Controversy === In 2010 a \"JNU Forum Against War on People\" was organised \"to oppose Operation Green Hunt launched by the government.\" According to the NSUI national general secretary, Shaikh Shahnawaz, the meeting was organised by the Democratic Students' Union (DSU) and All India Students Association (AISA) to \"celebrate the killing of 76 CRPF personnel in Chhattisgarh.\" Shaikh Shahnawaz also stated that \"they were even shouting slogans like 'India murdabad, Maovad zindabad'.\" NSUI and ABVP activists undertook a march against this meeting, \"which was seen as an attempt to support the Naxalites and celebrate the massacre,\" whereafter the various parties clashed. The organisers of the forum said that \"the event had nothing to do with the killings in Dantewada\" === 2015 Opposition to Saffronisation === In 2015, the JNU Students' Union and the All India Students Association objected to efforts to create instruction on Indian culture. Opposition to such courses was on the basis that such instruction was an attempt to saffronise education. Saffronisation refers to right-wing efforts to glorify ancient Hindu culture. The proposed courses were successfully opposed and were, thus, \"rolled back.\" A former student of JNU and a former student union member, Albeena Shakil, claimed that BJP officials in government were responsible for proposing the controversial courses. === 2015 Rainbow Walk === On 28 December 2014, the symbolic \"Rainbow Tree\" which stood for LGBTQ pride was vandalised. To counter the \"growing homophobia\" on the campus, JNU Students' Union along with other queer groups like Anjuman and Dhanak, led a march on 9 January, called Rainbow Walk. The march started from JNU's Ganga Dhaba and ended at the Rainbow Tree spot. The protestors criticised the 2013 verdict of the Supreme Court nullifying the Delhi High Court order reading down Section 377 of the IPC. The campaign aimed at celebrating individual right to sexual freedom and identity. The march was filled with songs and slogans; the students also painted a zebra crossing in rainbow colours and wrapped trees with rainbow coloured threads. ===2016 sedition controversy=== On 9 February, a cultural evening was organised by 10 students, formerly of the Democratic Students' Union (DSU), at the Sabarmati Dhaba, against the execution of Afzal Guru and separatist leader Maqbool Bhat, and for Kashmir's right to self-determination. \"Anti-India\" slogans like \"Pakistan Zindabad\", \"Kashmir ki azadi tak jung chalegi, Bharat ki barbadi tak jung chalegi\" (\"War will continue till Kashmir's freedom, war will continue till India's demolition\") were reportedly raised at the protest meet.\" Protests by members of ABVP were held at the University demanding expulsion of the student organisers. JNU administration ordered a \"disciplinary\" enquiry into the holding of the event despite denial of permission, saying any talk about country's disintegration cannot be \"national\". The Delhi Police arrested the JNU Students' Union President Kanhaiya Kumar and Umar Khalid on charges of sedition and criminal conspiracy, under section 124 of the Indian Penal Code dating back to 1860. The arrest soon snowballed into a major political controversy, with several leaders of opposition parties visiting the JNU campus in solidarity with the students protesting against the police crackdown. More than 500 academics from around the world, including JNU alumni, released a statement in support of the students. In a separate statement, over 130 world-leading scholars including Noam Chomsky, Orhan Pamuk and Akeel Bilgrami called it a \"shameful act of the Indian government\" to invoke sedition laws formulated during colonial times to silence criticism.Chomsky to JNU V-C: why did you allow police on campus?, The Hindu, 21 February 2016.

As a part of this protest, students boycotted the final semester examinations. After protests, the University partially rolled back by reducing fee only for students from families with extreme poverty (BPL category) who do not avail any scholarship. The move did not convince the students as there was no rollback in the fee hike for non-BPL category students neither for BPL students availing a scholarship. To press the administration for a complete rollback of the increase in fees, JNUSU had continued the protests.Fee Hike Protests: JNU Inches Towards Institution-Wide Final Semester Exam Boycott , The Wire, 3 December 2019.
