    "text": "Municipalities in Brunei are settlements which have been incorporated by the government to run as municipalities. They are independent from the hierarchy of the country's subdivisions but nevertheless overlap with mukims and villages, the second- and third-level administrative divisions of Brunei. The governing body of a municipality is municipal department () which is a government department under the Ministry of Home Affairs; the head is a chairman (, officially ) which is equivalent to mayor. ==List== There are four settlements in Brunei which have municipal status, namely Bandar Seri Begawan, the capital of Brunei; Kuala Belait, a town and capital of Belait District; Seria, a town also in Belait District; and Tutong, the town of Tutong District. Although Muara in Brunei-Muara District and Bangar, the capital of Temburong District, are officially known in Malay as and (literally 'Muara Town' and 'Bangar Town'), they do not have municipal status but instead administered as village-level subdivisions. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+List of municipalities in Brunei ! rowspan=\"2\" |Name ! rowspan=\"2\" |Type of settlement ! rowspan=\"2\" |Governing body ! colspan=\"2\" |Subdivisions under municipal jurisdiction |- !Mukim !Village |- | rowspan=\"10\" |Bandar Seri Begawan | rowspan=\"10\" |city, capital of Brunei | rowspan=\"10\" |Bandar Seri Begawan Municipal Department |Berakas 'A' | * Anggerek Desa * Burong Pingai Berakas * Jaya Bakti * Jaya Setia * Orang Kaya Besar Imas * Pancha Delima * Pengiran Siraja Muda Delima Satu * Pulaie * Serusop |- |Berakas 'B' | * Madang * Manggis * Sungai Akar |- |Burong Pingai Ayer | * Burong Pingai Ayer * Lurong Dalam * Pandai Besi 'A' * Pandai Besi 'B' * Pekan Lama * Pengiran Setia Negara * Sungai Pandan 'A' * Sungai Pandan 'B' |- |Gadong 'B' | * Beribi * Kiarong * Kiulap * Mata-Mata * Menglait * Pengkalan Gadong |- |Kianggeh | * Berangan * City Centre * Diplomatic Enclave * Kianggeh * Kumbang Pasang * Parit * Pusar Ulak * Tasek Lama * Tumasek * Tungkadeh |- |Kota Batu | * Belimbing * Kota Batu * Pelambayan * Pintu Malim * Sungai Lampai |- |Peramu | * Bakut Berumput * Bakut Siraja Muda 'A' * Bakut Siraja Muda 'B' * Lurong Sikuna * Pekilong Muara * Peramu * Setia Pahlawan Lama |- |Saba | * Saba Darat 'A' * Saba Darat 'B' * Saba Laut * Saba Tengah * Saba Ujong |- |Sungai Kebun | * Bolkiah 'A' * Bolkiah 'B' * Setia 'A' * Setia 'B' * Sungai Kebun * Sungai Siamas * Ujong Kelinik |- |Tamoi | * Pengiran Bendahara Lama * Pengiran Kerma Indera Lama * Pengiran Tajuddin Hitam * Tamoi Tengah * Tamoi Ujong |- |Kuala Belait |town, capital of Belait District | rowspan=\"2\" |Kuala Belait and Seria Municipal Department |Kuala Belait | * Kuala Belait * Pandan 'A' * Pandan 'B' * Pandan 'C' * Mumong 'A' * parts of Mumong 'B' |- |Seria |town |Seria | * parts of Seria Area 1 * parts of Seria Area 2 |- |Tutong |town, capital of Tutong District |Tutong Municipal Department |Pekan Tutong | * parts of Petani * parts of Bukit Bendera |} == See also == * Administrative divisions of Brunei == References == ",
