A marine painter, he made numerous illustrations for encyclopedias and books published by Sea of Larousse editions. An accomplished yachtsman, he accompanied Prince Albert 1st of Monaco on some of his oceanographic expeditions. The prince invited him to collaborate in the creation of the frescoes of the Grand Amphitheater of the Oceanographic Institute of Paris, for which he financed the construction. Alexandre Brun also executed commissions for Baroness Nathaniel de Rothschild, barons Arthur and Edmond de Rothschild, and relatives, such as Louis Libreck, for whom he produced his most famous work: a series of watercolors immortalizing his friend's collection of orchids.

A member of the Salon des artistes fran\u00e7ais from 1877, he submitted works almost every year until 1934. He exhibited in London at the Royal Academy in 1881 and 1882, and at the Universal Exhibition in 1889, during which he was awarded the Bronze Medal, Marine Section, before deciding to devote himself to travelling various regions of France and Algeria.
