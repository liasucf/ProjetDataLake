Abs-Cbn Interactive, Kristine: No time for boys; 'A Love Story' is top-grosser ==Plot== What would you do if you met the woman of your dreams and wanted to make her your wife after you've married someone else? Ian Montes (Aga Muhlach) was the embodiment of success and despite being the son of a shipping tycoon, Ian refused to just ride on the success of his father's empire. Instead, he built his own real estate company, where he earned his first million at a very young age and has never looked back since. Driven by the ambition to become as good, if not better than his father, Ian managed to claw his way to the top and make it on his own. But behind the glorious facade was a broken man yearning for love and recognition, still scarred from when his mother abandoned them at the impressionable age of 17, compounded by his desire for his father's approval, Ian longed for someone who can and will love him unconditionally. Lightning struck twice when he met the two women who would change his life forever - Joanna Villanueva (Maricel Soriano) and Karyn Torres (Angelica Panganiban). Joanna was the picture of quiet confidence and eminence. Although heartbroken herself from a failed marriage to an errant ex-husband, Joanna found love again when she rescued Ian from a water-skiing accident in La Union. Being a doctor by trade, she nurtured Ian and showered him with the love and attention he craved. With Joanna, Ian found the home he sorely missed in his youth and a life of bliss he never thought possible. But then came Karyn Torres, a vivacious flight attendant he met on a business trip to Macau. At twenty-four, she was the epitome of youthful sensuality and worldliness- with her, every moment Ian spent was filled with excitement and spontaneity, along with the realization that this was the life he's always wanted. So now, Ian is left with a choice... as painful as it may be, Ian, Joanna and Karyn must learn the true meaning of unconditional love and forgiveness.Plot Summary for A Love Story ==Cast and characters== ===Main cast=== *Maricel Soriano as Joanna Villanueva *Aga Muhlach as Ian Montes *Angelica Panganiban as Karyn Torres- Montes ===Supporting cast=== *Dante Rivero as Sergio Montes *Chin Chin Gutierrez as Concha *Bobby Andrews as Roy *TJ Trinidad as Rick Montes *Baron Geisler as Macky *John Arcilla as Steve *Gerald Madrid as Jake Villanueva *Mark Acueza as Jason *Bart Guingona as Hector Villanueva *R.S.
