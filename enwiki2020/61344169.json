    "text": "Pentecostal and Full Gospel Churches are a family of churches that are generally considered to have similar beliefs. Many of the larger denominations are members of the Pentecostal World Fellowship. In North America, there is also an interdenominational organization called The Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America (PCCNA). There is also a separate Nontrinitarian group of Pentecostal Churches commonly called Oneness Pentecostal Churches, but because of their differing views on the Trinity, they are generally categorized separately from Trinitarian Pentecostal and Full Gospel churches. Many of the membership numbers below are reported by the denominations themselves, and as such they should be considered approximate. Also, the list itself should not be considered comprehensive because there are many small, denominations which are below 100,000 in membership, and individual churches which chose not to affiliate with other denominations. == List of Trinitarian Pentecostal and Full Gospel Churches == *Assemblies of God \u2013 69 million *Apostolic Church \u2013 15 million *Fangcheng Fellowship \u2013 10 million (estimated) *China Gospel Fellowship - 10 million (estimated) *International Church of the Foursquare Gospel - 8.8 million *Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee) - 7 million *Church of God in Christ - 6.5 million *Church of Pentecost \u2013 3 million *Christian Congregation of Brazil \u2013 2.8 million *The Pentecostal Mission \u2013 2.5 million *International Pentecostal Holiness Church \u2013 2 million *Universal Church of the Kingdom of God \u2013 2 million *Church of God of Prophecy \u2013 1.5 million *Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa \u2013 1.4 million *Association of Pentecostal Churches of Rwanda \u2013 1 million *Jesus Is Lord Church Worldwide \u2013 1 million *Indian Pentecostal Church of God \u2013 0.9 million *God is Love Pentecostal Church \u2013 0.8 million *Pentecostal Church of God \u2013 .6 million *New Life Fellowship Association \u2013 .5 million *The Fellowship Network \u2013 .4 million *Association of Vineyard Churches \u2013 .4 million/2,500 affiliated churches worldwidechordify.net *Manna Full Gospel Churches \u2013 .3 million *Open Bible Churches - .15 million *Full Gospel Church of God in South Africa - unknown *Calvary Chapel \u2013 unknown membership *Elim Pentecostal Church *Swiss Pentecostal Missionhttps://www.pfingstmission.ch/gemeinden/gemeindefinderhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schweizerische_Pfingstmission 10'000 Members in 2013 *BewegungPlushttps://www.bewegungplus.chhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/BewegungPlus about 5'000 Members *Freie Charismatische Gemeindenhttps://fcgs- ecls.ch/gemeindenhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freie_Charismatische_Gemeinden_der_Schweiz == List of Oneness Pentecostal Churches == *United Pentecostal Church International - 4.9m *Pentecostal Assemblies of the World - 1.5m == References == Pentecostal Category:Pentecostalism-related lists ",
