    "text": "The Duchess of Benameji (Spanish: La duquesa de Benamej\u00ed) is a 1949 Spanish historical drama film directed by Luis Lucia and starring Amparo Rivelles. The film is set in the nineteenth century, with Rivelles playing dual roles as a countess and a gypsy. The film was an expensive costume production by Spain's largest studio CIFESA. It is an adaptation of the 1932 play of the same name by Antonio and Manuel Machado. Before its release, the censor demanded that it be rewritten to more overtly punish bandits.Bentley p.106 ==Cast== * Amparo Rivelles * Jorge Mistral And in alphabetical order * Manuel Aguilera * Fernando Aguirre * Valeriano Andr\u00e9s as Teniente * Mariano Asquerino * Francisco Bernal * Irene Caba Alba * Julia Caba Alba * Benito Cobe\u00f1a * Alfonso de C\u00f3rdoba * Carlos D\u00edaz de Mendoza * Eduardo Fajardo * F\u00e9lix Fernandez * Manuel Guiti\u00e1n * Casimiro Hurtado * Jos\u00e9 Jaspe * Manuel Luna * Juana Mans\u00f3 * \u00c1ngel Martinez * Arturo Mar\u00edn * Miguel Pastor * Manuel Requena * Antonio Riquelme * Domingo Rivas == References == ==Bibliography== * Bentley, Bernard.
