Katok is also a designated postcode area with the postcode BE2319. == Geography == Katok is primarily a residential area on the outskirts of Bandar Seri Begawan, the capital of Brunei. It is the original settlement area for which Katok 'A' and Katok 'B', two housing areas under the government's Landless Indigenous Citizens' Housing Scheme ( or simply STKRJ), are named after. However, the two areas are not contiguous to Katok; Katok 'A' is regarded part of Tungku and hence its other full name Tungku Landless Indigenous Citizens' Housing Scheme Area 3, where as Katok 'B' is part of the Mata-Mata settlement and hence its alternative full name Mata-Mata Landless Indigenous Citizens' Housing Scheme. Nevertheless, Katok is contiguous to both Tungku and Mata-Mata to its north and south respectively. As a village subdivision, Katok technically borders Tungku and Katok 'A' Landless Indigenous Citizens' Housing Scheme (also Tungku Landless Indigenous Citizens' Housing Scheme Area 3) to the north, Tungku Landless Indigenous Citizens' Housing Scheme Area 1 to the north-east, Mata-Mata to the east and south, Mata-Mata Landless Indigenous Citizens' Housing Scheme Area 2 to the south, Tanjong Bunut to the south-west, Selayun to the west, and Peninjau to the north-west. == References == Category:Villages of Brunei Category:Populated places in Brunei ",
