    "text": "' is a small asteroid, classified a near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo group. ==Orbit== The orbit of makes it a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid (PHA) whose orbit has been determined with about 1 year of observations. The orbit of is somewhat uncertain, but could pass a distance of 0.001635 AU (244,600 km) from the Earth in the year 2087. Only the nominal (best-fit) orbit shows a passage this close. The uncertainty region is still somewhat large due to a short observation arc. For comparison, the distance to the Moon is about 0.0026 AU (384,400 km). appears on the list of PHA close approaches issued by the Minor Planet Center (MPC), with the next close approach in the year 2038. The Jupiter Tisserand invariant, used to distinguish different kinds of orbits, is 5.7. ==References== == External links == * * * # Category:Minor planet object articles (unnumbered) # 20111116 ",
