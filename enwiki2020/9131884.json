The band had several hits with songs like Supernatural and Rock U. Supernatural was expected to take part in the Swedish precursor selections for the Eurovision Song Contest in 2003 but its record label did not publicize the band sufficiently and the members subsequently split up in 2004 after arguments with their record label. ==Members== *Mathilda Carmbrant *Linda Eriksson (aka Linda Varg) *Sandra Leto *Robert Skowronski *Sebastian Zelle ==After split-up== The members of Supernatural started a new band, this time with the name Caught Up, but it did not experience the same success. ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"10\"|Year !align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"120\"|Album !align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\" width=\"20\"|Peak positions !align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"120\"|Certification |- !width=\"20\"|SWE |- |2002 |Dreamcatcher | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 | |- |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"10\"|Year !align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"120\"|Single !align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\" width=\"20\"|Peak positions !align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"120\"|Certification !align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"120\"|Album |- !width=\"20\"|SWE |- |rowspan=3|2002 |\"Supernatural\" | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 | style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=3|Dreamcatcher |- |\"Rock U\" | style=\"text-align:center;\"|3 | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- |\"Kryptonite\" | style=\"text-align:center;\"|56 | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |} ==References== Category:Popstars winners Category:Swedish pop music groups ",
