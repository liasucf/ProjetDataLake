Young co-wrote ten of the album's thirteen tracks. The album was produced by Dann Huff, with engineer Justin Niebank and executive producer Jimmy Harnen. Collaborators on the album include Gavin DeGraw, Ashley Gorley, Shane McAnally, Hillary Lindsey, Charles Kelley and Ross Copperman. The first song written for the album is \"Used to Missin' You\" he co-wrote with Jimmy Robbins and Jon Nite, which was intended for his previous album Brett Young. He wrote \"Chapters\" with Gavin Degraw, who wanted the song to be about Young's story. This album has a lighter feel than the previous album, although it ended with a sombre ballad \"Don't Wanna Write This Song\", which is intended to mirror \"Mercy\" of that album. ==Commercial performance== Ticket to L.A. debuted at number one on Billboard Top Country Albums and number 15 on the US Billboard 200, selling 27,000 copies (37,000 in equivalent album units) in the first week.
