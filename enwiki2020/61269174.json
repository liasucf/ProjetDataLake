    "text": "Kalobo is a village on the north-eastern coast of the island of Salawati in the Raja Ampat Archipelago of the Indonesia province of West Papua. It is the administrative headquarters of the district of Salawati Tengah. The kampung of Kalobo has a population of 315 people, while the adjacent kampungs of Sakabu and Wailen have populations of 327 and 162 respectively (according to a 2016 estimate). Kalobo has been described as a melting pot. Originally established as a transmigration village for settlers from the overpopulated parts of western Indonesia, it has since expanded with people from nearby parts of Salawati. These include settlers from the village of Samate (who speak the Ma'ya language), as well as interior-oriented groups, some of whom are speakers of a language/dialect known variously as Banlol, Butleh; . or Metli, while others speak the closely related Kawit. At least some of the latter have come from the former village of Pakon, which was once situated nearby. This situation of diversity has enabled the shift to the local variety of Malay (the lingua franca of the Raja Ampat Islands) as a first language. == References == == Bibliography == * * * * Category:Populated places in Raja Ampat ",
