    "text": "Rappin' is a 1985 film directed by Joel Silberg, written by Adam Friedman and Robert J. Litz, produced by Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus and starring Mario Van Peebles. The film is a sequel to Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo, and is also known as Breakdance 3: Electric Boogalee. Although it features Ice-T (who featured in Breakin' and Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo), Rappin' has a plot unconnected to the previous two films and features different lead characters and locations. The film has developed a small cult following, despite Van Peebles' lack of rapping ability and the film's overall poor production values. ==Overview== Rappin' John Hood (Van Peebles), an ex-convict, attempts to save his neighborhood from developers and hoodlums. Around the same time, one of the hoodlums' girlfriend, Cecilia, persuades him to audition for a rap recording contract which will develop into a relationship. Mario Van Peebles' raps were overdubbed by Master Gee of the Sugarhill Gang, who also wrote one part. The movie was filmed in and around Pittsburgh. Ice-T's small role is uncredited and he reportedly provided the rhymes, including the hero's climactic lines, \"Can't stop / Won't stop / Climbing that mountain 'till we reach the top!\" ==Cast and crew== *Mario Van Peebles: John Hood *Rutanya Alda: Cecilia *Eyde Byrde: Grandma *Rony Clanton: Cedric *Melvin Plowden: Fats *Jessie Daniels, Antoine Lundy, Charles Nelson, Trisco Pearson: The Force M.D.s *Richie Abanes: Richie *Harry Goz: Thorndike *Kadeem Hardison: Moon *Eriq La Salle: Ice *Leo O'Brien: Allan *Thomas Ross: Thomas *Joe Schad: Burton *Tasia Valenza: Dixie *Eugene Wilde: Himself *Richy Givens: Gangster ==Featured songs== * Rappin' \u2013 Lovebug Starski * Snack Attack \u2013 Melvin Plowden, Mario Van Peebles, Eriq La Salle, Kadeem Hardison, Richie Abanes * The Fight Rap \u2013 Lovebug Starski * Neighborhood Walk \u2013 Mario Van Peebles * Itchin' For A Scratch \u2013 The Force M.D.'s * Flame In The Fire \u2013 Warren Mills * Call Me \u2013 D.
