It's believed the aircraft encountered a violent electrical storm south of Rolleston which caused it disintegrate and crash on Rewan Station. The wreckage was discovered on 18 November 1943. The bodies recovered from the wreckage were initially taken to Springsure before being transported to Rockhampton. The bodies of the Americans were then taken to Ipswich where they were buried, before being returned to the United States. The bodies of the Australians were buried in the North Rockhampton Cemetery on 25 November 1943.(31 July 2019) North Rockhampton Burial Index (PDF), Rockhampton Regional Council.

It was dedicated at a special ceremony on 26 April 2004.(23 April 2004) Memorial to honour war crash victims, ABC News. Retrieved 28 August 2019. Due to wartime censorship, there was no press coverage of the Rewan disaster at the time, which was similar to what occurred following the Canal Creek air crash north of Rockhampton and the Bakers Creek air crash near Mackay. There was only a fleeting mention of both the Rewan and Canal Creek disasters in Rockhampton's local newspaper The Morning Bulletin in September 1945 at the conclusion of World War II, almost two years after the disasters.(21 September 1945) Recreation and social side of US Army's stay, The Morning Bulletin.
