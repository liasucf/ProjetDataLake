After selling his rights to the Captaincy of S\u00e3o Miguel to Rui Gon\u00e7alves da C\u00e2mara, he continued as Donatary-Captain of Santa Maria. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Jo\u00e3o Soares de Albergaria was the son of Fern\u00e3o Soares de Albergaria and Teresa Velho Cabral, the latter a sister of Gon\u00e7alo Velho Cabral. He married Brites Godins, who quickly became sick. Their marriage would not produce heirs. In 1474, due to his wife's illness, Albergaria moved to the island of Madeira in order to \"find remedies and medics\", as well as a milder climate for her to convalesce in. They lodged with the family of the Captain of Funchal Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves Zarco and that of his brother, Rui Gon\u00e7alves da C\u00e2mara. As Azorean chronicler Gaspar Frutuoso would later relate, due to S\u00e3o Miguel's perceived unproductivity and the many costs Soares de Albergaria incurred during his move to Funchal and treatments for his wife, Albergaria decided to sell the Captaincy of S\u00e3o Miguel to Rui Gon\u00e7alves for his hospitality in return for 2,000 cruzados and of sugar.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.22-23 Beatriz, Duchess of Viseu and Diogo, Duke of Viseu approved this contract, and King Afonso V of Portugal ratified it on 10 March 1474. ===Captaincy=== During his captaincy, Albergaria promoted settlement of Santa Maria\u2014attracting settlers from both Portugal (mainly Algarve) and continental Europe\u2014and founded the principal village of Vila do Porto. It became the base for future Captains-Generals in the Azores. Before this, his maternal uncle Gon\u00e7alo Velho Cabral had been \"Commander of Santa Maria and Captain of the Azores\" within a structural framework that was not properly defined. In contrast, King Afonso V explicitly approved Jo\u00e3o Soares de Albergaria's captaincy in a 1474 edict: As captain-general Albergaria was also responsible for the island's defense. However, in 1480 a Castilian corsair attacked Vila do Porto during the War of the Castilian Succession, sacking the town. Albergaria was captured and taken prisoner to Castile, where he was ransomed.Figueiredo (1990), p.67/74Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.20 He paid his own ransom eight days before peace were declared by Afonso V and Ferdinand of Castile at the end of 1480. ===Later life=== Albergaria later married Branca de Sousa Falc\u00e3o, daughter of Jo\u00e3o de Sousa Falc\u00e3o, 1st Lord de Figueiredo and 1st Lord of the Manor de Fata\u00fan\u00e7os, and D. Maria de Almada. They married on 20 June 1492 on the orders of King Jo\u00e3o II. They had at least four children together: * Jo\u00e3o Soares de Sousa, who would inherit his father's title as 3rd Donatary-Captain of Santa Maria; * Pedro Soares, who died overseas in Portuguese India; * D. Maria, who married in Portugal; and * D. Violante, who married a Castilian in Santa Maria. Albergaria returned to Santa Maria from Madeira late in life. He died there in 1499 at 80 years of age. The captaincy of Santa Maria passed on to his descendants until its extinction in 1667, following the death Br\u00e1s Soares de Sousa in 1664.A royal decree dated 23 May 1667 integrated the Captaincy of Santa Maria into the House of Castelo Melhor, while the captaincy system would be completely abolished in 1766 in the context of reforms instituted by the Marquis of Pombal (Arquivo dos A\u00e7ores, 1981, IV: 205). ==References== ;Notes ;Sources * * * * Soares Joao Category:1415 births Category:1499 deaths Category:15th-century Portuguese people ",
