The networks involved in the switch of allegiances are predominantly both free-to-air networks or both subscription television networks. Programs that have their free-to-air/subscription television premiere, after previously premiering on the opposite platform (free-to air to subscription/subscription to free-to air) are not included. In some cases, programs may still air on the original television network. This occurs predominantly with programs shared between subscription television networks. ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; font- size:87%;\" |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! style=\"width:40%;\"| Program ! style=\"width:20%;\"| New network(s) ! style=\"width:20%;\"| Previous network(s) ! style=\"width:20%;\"| Date |- | It Ain't Half Hot Mum | Seven Network | ABC TV | |- | / Zoom the White Dolphin | SBS TV | ABC TV | |- | Who Will Comfort Toffle? | ABC TV | SBS TV | |- | Murder She Wrote | Network Ten | Nine Network | |} ==Television shows== ===1950s=== * Mr. Squiggle and Friends (1959\u20131999) ===1960s=== * Four Corners (1961 \u2013 present) ===1970s=== * Hey Hey It's Saturday (1971\u20131999, 2009\u20132010) * Young Talent Time (1971\u20131988) * 60 Minutes (1979 \u2013 present) ===1980s=== * Sale of the Century (1980\u20132001) * Wheel of Fortune (1981\u20131996, 1996\u20132003, 2004 \u2013 present) * Sunday (1981\u20132008) * Today (1982 \u2013 present) * Neighbours (1985 \u2013 present) * The Flying Doctors (1986\u20131993) * Rage (1987 \u2013 present) * Home and Away (1988 \u2013 present) * The Comedy Company (1988\u20131990) * Seven's Super Saturday (1988\u20131990) ==Ending this year== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- \" !
