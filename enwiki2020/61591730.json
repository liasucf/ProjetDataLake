    "text": "Eve is the third studio album by American rapper Rapsody, released on August 23, 2019. Each song is named for an influential black woman, including Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey, Myrlie Evers, and Aaliyah. Eve also samples artists like Phil Collins (his hit single \"In the Air Tonight\" was sampled on the second track \"Cleo\"), Nina Simone and Herbie Hancock. ==Production== Rapsody decided to write the album in 2018 when a writer asked her if she felt that she was a successor to Nina Simone and Roberta Flack. She crafted an album with each song dedicated to one of her heroes. ==Critical reception== Eve was critically acclaimed by contemporary music critics at the time of its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 90, based on 8 reviews. Andy Kellman reviewed the album for AllMusic, concluding that \"[Rapsody's] lyrical marksmanship, top-tier mike command, and service to her people and culture are indisputable.\" Reviewing the album for HipHopDX, Kyle Eustice claimed that \"The 16-track potent lyrical adventure is peppered with countless poetic musings masquerading as seamless Hip Hop tracks, easily solidifying Rapsody\u2019s musical legacy.\" In the review for Pitchfork, Sheldon Pearce described Rapsody as \"A self-professed rapper\u2019s rapper, [she] has been taut and inflexible in the past, almost as if having to force her immense talent to overcome a deck stacked against her. It sounds like she\u2019s in a home-run trot on Eve.\" Roisin O'Conner also praised the album in the review for The Independent; \"Women\u2019s power, as a source of strength, intellect, emotion and, most importantly, life, has been a recurring theme in the North Carolina artist\u2019s work for years. On her new album, Eve, she explores a lineage of black female icons in a way that is both tender and compelling.\" Writing about the album's content, Stephen Kearse stated in a review for Rolling Stone that \"Throughout Eve, Rapsody speaks frankly of the burdens black women bear, citing infighting that perpetuates sexism (\"Cleo\") as well as the psychic costs of the violence that black men endure (\"Myrlie\") and commit (\"Afeni\"). These are not new themes for her, but here they resonate more fully. As she taps into the specific struggles and tribulations borne by her idols, she sees her own battles with visibility and self-assurance more clearly. Black girls are magic, but they are also people.\" In the review for The Guardian, Aimee Cliff declared, \"With a delivery cut from the same cloth as Jay-Z or Lauryn Hill, she\u2019s a storyteller, and counterbalances her wisdom with a dry, playful wit. Plus, she\u2019s the queen of the dismissive one-liner.\" In a year-end essay for Slate, Ann Powers cited Eve as one of her favorite albums from 2019 and proof that the format is not dead but rather undergoing a \"metamorphosis\". She added that concept albums had reemerged through the culturally-relevant autobiographical narratives of artists such as Rapsody, who created a tribute to her ancestors \"that spoke volumes about black life today\". ==Track listing== Credits adapted from Tidal.
