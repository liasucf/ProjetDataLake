The hairstyle indicated social status, and men who did not wear Amasunzu were looked on with suspicion until the 20th century. The style was also worn by unmarried women after the age of 18\u201320 years, indicating that they are of marriageable age. ==References== Category:Rwandan culture Category:Hairstyles ",
