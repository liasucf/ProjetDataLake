It stars famous telenovela actresses Patr\u00edcia Pillar and Gl\u00f3ria Pires and Bruno Campos, which later became known for his role as Quentin Costa on Nip/Tuck. The original soundtrack was composed by classical musician Jaques Morelenbaum and the theme song by pop singer-songwriter Caetano Veloso. It was the first Brazilian film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in more than 30 years, after 1962's O Pagador de Promessas. ==Plot== The film follows the story of two Italian immigrant couples living in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in the early 20th century; Teresa (Patr\u00edcia Pillar) and Angelo (Alexandre Paternost) and Pierina (Gl\u00f3ria Pires) and Massimo (Bruno Campos). While the couples struggle for survival in their new country, an unexpected love between Massimo and Teresa emerges. They fight against family and cultural traditions and head to a new destiny, leaving their partners behind. Quatrilho is the name of a card game in which the player has to betray his partner in order to win. It is also a reference to the Portuguese language word quatro, which means four. The film was also advertised as O Qu4trilho. ==Cast== *Patr\u00edcia Pillar as Teresa *Gl\u00f3ria Pires as Pierina *Bruno Campos as Massimo *Alexandre Paternost as Angelo *Cecil Thir\u00e9 as Father Gentile *Jos\u00e9 Lewgoy as Rocco *F\u00e1bio Barreto as Gaud\u00e9rio *Jos\u00e9 Clemente Pozenato as the photographer ==Awards and nominations== Beside its Academy Award nomination, the film won three awards at the Havana Film Festival: Best Actress for Gl\u00f3ria Pires, Best Art Direction and Best Music.
