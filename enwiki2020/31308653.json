In the present, while Steve is proposing an idea to his friends of tasting 31 ice cream flavors at Baskin-Robbins, Snot professes his love for Hayley, despite her marriage to Jeff Fischer. Hayley rejects Snot, leaving him depressed, so Steve and Roger devise a plan to cheer him up. Roger dresses up as Steve's teenage cousin from New Jersey, Jenny Fromdabloc, and Snot falls in love with her at a video arcade, where Steve, Toshi, and Barry all leave the two alone to connect. The next day, at Pearl Bailey High School, Snot announces to Steve and his friends that he and his date went to the beach and had sex there, much to Steve's horror. Back home, Steve becomes outraged at Roger and the two start fighting until Steve finds Roger washing a stress ball he used for another persona. When Steve questions Roger on why he is cleaning it, Roger reveals he is using it in order to have sex with Snot. At the Wild West Land amusement park, Steve spills the news to Snot, showing the stress ball as proof. Devastated, Snot ends his relationship with Roger, which upsets Roger as well. Steve once again announces his original 31 flavors idea, but Snot remains depressed from his broken relationship. Steve devises another idea to get him and Roger back together. In his Jenny disguise, Roger meets Snot again and apologizes for his past actions, and Snot accepts him back into their relationship again, moments before Roger gets hit and killed by a bus. Snot is once again dismayed until Steve mentions that Snot has gotten closer to having sex with someone than anyone in the group. Roger shows up momentarily in another disguise and tells Steve he faked his death, explaining his ability to move very fast as he sets up a decoy of his Jenny persona right before the bus hits it. Meanwhile, Stan decides to live life like a man from the 1960s after watching an episode of Bewitched. When he wants to start drinking martinis, Francine objects since he cannot handle his alcohol. However, she gives him a chance, only to subsequently chase him running down the street in only his underwear. Francine then disbars the arrangement, but Stan decides to get drunk again, causing him to pass out repeatedly and believe that Francine is a witch. ==Production== Edward Asner made a guest appearance on the show. \"Jenny Fromdabloc\" was directed by series regular Bob Bowen, in his fourth episode of the season.

In a flashback Steve and his friends visit Dennis Quaid and his brother Randy Quaid. Hayley's favorite song is revealed to be \"Gangsta's Paradise\" by Coolio. Stan and Francine agree to act like characters out of the 1960s television series Bewitched and I Dream of Jeannie. The scene in which Stan hallucinates and imagines Francine as a witch flying on a broom is shown in a similar fashion to the opening sequence of Bewitched. The witch then flies into a building, a reference to the September 11 attacks. Roger excitedly mentions that he wants a pair of cigarette jeans, a looked first popularized and endorsed by Forever 21. Roger, as Jenny, compares Snot to a \"young Paul Reiser\" whereas Steve says on his best day he is Rob Morrow. While setting up the Jenny dummy, Roger receives a text from Bob Saget. Principal Lewis attempts to sell two belts, one containing a bird that closely resembles Tweety Bird and the other containing a lyric from the Janet Jackson song \"Nasty\". Snot's basement is designed in a similar fashion as the basement of Eric Foreman from That '70s Show. The final scene during the ending credits of the episode is a reference to the 2010 science fiction action heist film, Inception. ==Reception== \"Jenny Fromdabloc\" was first broadcast on April 17, 2011 as part of the animation television night on Fox.

Steve's friend Snot is obsessed with Hayley, who [...] isn't interested. In order to break him out of his rut, Steve convinces Roger to play a teenaged girl who's interested in Snot. Naturally, Roger goes too far, and it's fantastic.\" He went on to give the episode an \"A\" grade, the highest rating of the night, scoring higher than the Family Guy episode \"Brothers & Sisters\" and The Cleveland Show episode \"Back to Cool\".
