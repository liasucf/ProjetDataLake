    "text": "The 12th Street station is a future DART Light Rail and commuter rail station along the Red Line and the Silver Line in Plano, Texas. The station has two levels, with the ground-level at 12th Street & K Avenue (1199 12th Street) serving the Silver Line and the elevated level (two blocks west at 1000 12th St) serving the Red Line. The City of Plano approved the purchase of a piece of land in February 2015 in anticipation of its construction. The two platforms will be connected by a sidewalk about 500 feet long. The station's bus bays and parking lots will be next to the Silver Line platform: the bus bays and a small parking lot on its north side and a larger parking lot on its south side. ==References== Category:Dallas Area Rapid Transit light rail stations Category:Plano, Texas Category:Proposed public transportation in Texas Category:Proposed railway stations in the United States Category:Railway stations scheduled to open in 2023 Category:Dallas Area Rapid Transit commuter rail stations ",
