    "text": "Safe in the Hands of Love is the third studio album by American experimental electronic music artist Yves Tumor. It was released on September 5, 2018 by Warp Records. ==Release== Tumor released \"Noid\" as the first single from the album on July 24, 2018, and followed it with \"Licking an Orchid\" featuring James K on August 29, and \"Lifetime\" on September 3. It shared the track \"Economy of Freedom\" the following day, and surprise released the album digitally the next day with no prior announcement. It is its first album released on Warp Records. Physical editions were released on October 12. ==Critical reception== At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, Safe in the Hands of Love received an average score of 89, based on 9 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Eoin Murray of The Quietus stated that \"Yves Tumor has let assertiveness, assuredness and vulnerability run wild within him for Safe in the Hands of Love and the result is magisterial and deeply engaging.\" Sypros Statis of PopMatters wrote, \"What pushes Safe in the Hands of Love beyond the producer's previous works is the emotion that the record transmits. No matter if the synths are harsh, or the rhythm section arrives with the perfect groove, this is a work filled with an emotive purpose, and it is that core that makes it such a wonderful listen.\" Tiny Mix Tapes writer Sam Goldner said, \"Bowie's only consistent trajectory has been one of tearing down his mythos even as his builds it, and his latest manages to knock down yet another wall as he steps more fully into the light than he's ever dared tread before. On Safe in the Hands of Love, Yves Tumor isn't concerned with being \"experimental;\" he's simply concerned with being.\" Resident Advisors Matthew McDermott wrote, \"Yves Tumor joins the ranks of Arca and SOPHIE at the millennial generation's pop vanguard, a group whose fluid approach to music and imagery is eradicating the gap between underground and mainstream.\" The Wire said, \"Sometimes the sensuousness of Serpent Music is missed, but Tumor's drive to take this radically new music to audiences as big as Blake's, Ocean's or even Radiohead's is exhilarating.\" MusicOMH critic Ben Devlin called the album \"a fascinating synthesis of rock, plunderphonics, bass music and noise from an artist that remains stubbornly undefinable.\" In his rave review for Pitchfork, Jayson Greene wrote, \"You get the sense, maybe, that Tumor is carrying around other people's secrets, and that Safe in the Hands of Love is so cavernous-sounding, in part, to accommodate them. Holding all of this together is a stew of feelings\u2014dread, sensuousness, ecstasy, terror\u2014that melt into a mood so pungent and pervasive that people who grew up inside all kinds of different music will be beckoned towards it. Ambient electronic, dream-pop, experimental noise, '90s R&B;, even late-'90s alt-rock\u2014Tumor's music is fluid and generous enough to contain it all.\" Safe in the Hands of Love was ranked the 50th best release of the year in The Wire magazine's annual critics' poll. ==Track listing== Sample credits * \"Noid\" contains samples of \"Grace\", written by Ronnie Laws and Roxanne J. Seeman and recorded by Sylvia St. James * \"Let the Lioness in You Flow Freely\" contains a sample of \"Angel Fire\", written and recorded by Jan Haflin ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of Safe in the Hands of Love. ===Musicians=== * Yves Tumor \u2013 vocals; arrangement * Croatian Amor \u2013 arrangement * Will Artope \u2013 trumpet * Luke Niccoli \u2013 bass guitar * Evan Johns \u2013 drums * Andreas Emanuel \u2013 electric guitar ; additional electric guitar * James K \u2013 vocals ; additional violin * Derek Stein \u2013 cello * James Ferraro \u2013 additional grand piano * Oxhy \u2013 vocals * Jon Peven \u2013 additional percussion ===Technical personnel=== * Yves Tumor \u2013 production * Justin Raisen \u2013 co-production ; engineering * Mahssa Taghinia \u2013 executive production, management * Luke Niccoli \u2013 additional production, additional engineering, additional editing * Puce Mary \u2013 additional production * Paul Corley \u2013 mixing * Dave Cooley \u2013 mastering ===Artwork=== * Yves Tumor \u2013 creative direction, models casting * Isamaya Ffrench \u2013 creative direction, art direction, makeup * Mahssa Taghinia \u2013 creative direction * Collin Fletcher \u2013 design * Bliss Serenity Resting \u2013 logo, additional design * Evanie Frausto \u2013 hair * Midland Agency \u2013 models casting * Nick Royal \u2013 wardrobe, style * Jordan Hemingway \u2013 photography, video, production ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Various | September 5, 2018 | rowspan=\"2\"| Warp | Digital download | |- | October 12, 2018 | | |} ==References== Category:2018 albums Category:Warp (record label) albums Category:Albums produced by Justin Raisen Category:Yves Tumor albums ",
