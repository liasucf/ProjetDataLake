The county was established in 1968, after the administrative reorganization that re- introduced the historical jude\u0163 (county) system, still used today. This reform eliminated the previous Mure\u0219-Magyar Autonomous Region, which had been created in 1952 within the People's Republic of Romania. Mure\u0219 county has a vibrant multicultural fabric that includes Hungarian-speaking Sz\u00e9kelys and Transylvanian Saxons, with a rich heritage of fortified churches and towns. ==Name== In Hungarian, it is known as Maros megye (), and in German as Kreis Mieresch.

The capital was T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219. After the administrative unification law in 1925, it was renamed to Mure\u015f County, and the territory was reorganized. It was bordered on the south by T\u00e2rnava-Mic\u0103 County, on the southwest by Turda County, on the west by Cluj County, on the north by N\u0103s\u0103ud County, on the northeast with the counties of C\u00e2mpulung and Neam\u021b, and on the southeast with the counties of Ciuc and Odorhei. Most of the territory of the historical county is found in the present Mure\u015f County, except for the northeastern area, which is located in Harghita County, and the northwestern area in Bistri\u021ba-N\u0103s\u0103ud County today. ===History=== Prior to World War I, the territory of the county belonged to Austria-Hungary and identical with the Maros-Torda County of the Kingdom of Hungary. The territory of Mure\u0219 County was transferred to Romania from Hungary as successor state to Austria-Hungary in 1920 under the Treaty of Trianon. In 1938, King Carol II promulgated a new Constitution, and subsequently he had the administrative division of the Romanian territory changed. 10 \u021binuturi (approximate translation: \"lands\") were created (by merging the counties) to be ruled by reziden\u021bi regali (approximate translation: \"Royal Residents\") - appointed directly by the King - instead of the prefects. Mure\u0219 County became part of \u021ainutul Mure\u0219. In 1940, the county was transferred back to Hungary with the rest of Northern Transylvania under the Second Vienna Award. Beginning in 1944, Romanian forces with Soviet assistance recaptured the ceded territory and reintegrated it into Romania, re-establishing the county. Romanian jurisdiction over the entire county per the Treaty of Trianon was reaffirmed in the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947. The county was disestablished by the communist government of Romania in 1950, and re-established in 1968 when Romania restored the county administrative system. ===Administration=== Map of Mure\u0219 County as constituted in 1938. The county originally consisted of seven districts (pl\u0103\u1e63i):Portretul Rom\u00e2niei Interbelice - Jude\u021bul Mure\u0219 #Plasa Band, headquartered at Band #Plasa Miercurea Nirajului, headquartered at Miercurea Nirajului #Plasa R\u00e2ciu, headquartered at R\u00e2ciu #Plasa Reghin, headquartered at Reghin #Plasa T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 (also called Plasa Mure\u0219), headquartered at T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 #Plasa Teaca, headquartered at Teaca #Plasa Topli\u021ba, headquartered at Topli\u021ba A subsequent administrative adjustment added one district, divided Plasa Mure\u0219 into two, and divided Plasa Reghin into two, leaving ten districts: #Plasa Band, headquartered at Band #Plasa Gurhiu, headquartered at Gurghiu #Plasa Miercurea Nirajului, headquartered at Miercurea Nirajului #Plasa Mure\u0219 de Jos, headquartered at Mure\u0219eni #Plasa Mure\u0219 de Sus, headquartered at T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 #Plasa R\u00e2ciu, headquartered at R\u00e2ciu #Plasa Reghin de Jos, headquartered at Reghin #Plasa Reghin de Sus, headquartered at Suseni #Plasa Teaca, headquartered at Teaca #Plasa Topli\u021ba, headquartered at Topli\u021ba The county had two urban localities: T\u00e2rgu Mure\u015f (a city) and Reghin (urban commune). === Population === According to the census data of 1930, the county's population was 289,546, of which 45.8% were Romanians, 42.6% Hungarians, 3.9% Germans, 3.9% Romanies, 3.4% Jews, as well as other minorities.
