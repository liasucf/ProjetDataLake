Pollock was born in Quebec City, Quebec, but grew up in Victoria, British Columbia. ==Playing career== Pollock was drafted in the fourth round, 106th overall, in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft by the St. Louis Blues. After playing four seasons in the Western Hockey League for the Seattle Thunderbirds, Pollock joined the Blues' American Hockey League affiliate, the Worcester IceCats. He spent five seasons with the IceCats, and debuted in the National Hockey League with the Blues during the 2003\u201304 season. Pollock appeared in nine games with the Blues, recording no points. Pollock was an All Star defenceman on Canada's winning Spengler Cup team in 2003. During the 2004\u201305 NHL lockout, Pollock went to Switzerland's Nationalliga A and played for the Kloten Flyers and HC Lugano. He remained in Europe for the 2005\u201306 season, joining the DEL's N\u00fcrnberg Ice Tigers where he played for two seasons leading Nurnberg to the DEL Finals in 2007. During that season, he set a record for the most goals in a season by a defenceman and played for Canada as they won the World Cup. On July 5, 2007, Pollock was signed by the Washington Capitals to a two-way deal but left the Capitals minor league team, the Hershey Bears, in December 2007 to play with CSKA Moscow in the Russian Superleague. In the inaugural season of the Kontinental Hockey League, Pollock returned to Russia and played with HC MVD in the 2008\u201309 season. On April 6, 2009, he transferred from MVD to the Deutsche Eishockey Liga with top club Adler Mannheim.
