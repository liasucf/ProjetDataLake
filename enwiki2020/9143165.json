His father, who was cricket administrator at that time was having financial difficulties and hence the decision. Nepalese coach Jagat Tamata regarded him as the best batsmen ever produced in non-test country. Fans felt betrayed and many say that his decision to move to the US single-handedly pushed Nepali cricket back by 5 years.
