Among its members are two Catholic saints, three bishops, and five generals. Because his marriage with Victorine-Antoinette de Pontev\u00e8s was childless, he named as his heirs the two nephews of his wife: Edouard and L\u00e9onide de Pontev\u00e8s- Barg\u00e8me, in whose favor a royal ordinance of 1828, and 1829 letters-patent, autorised the transmission of the title of Duke of Sabran. The name de Sabran has since been carried by the de Pontev\u00e8s family, through the adoption in 1832 == Origin == The name stemmed from the barony of Sabran near Bagnols sur C\u00e8ze in the north of the d\u00e9partement of Gard. The barony also possessed in Provence significant assets in the town of Beaucaire, as well as a portion of the city of Uz\u00e8s, which fell to it as a result of the marriage around 1156 of Rostaing II to Roscie du Caylar, granddaughter of Elz\u00e9art d'Uz\u00e8s. The ancient old, former lords of Sabran styled themselves by the grace of God, constables of the counts ofToulouse. The family was very proud to count two Catholic saints among its members : Elz\u00e9ar de Sabran, canonized in 1369, and his wife Dauphine or Delphine, proclaimed bienheureuse, for their mystic love and their love for the humble. Procession is still made for them every September in Ansouis, whose lordly domain has belonged to their family since the 10th century, then belonged to it again from 1836 to 2008. Several of its members were knights of the order of Malta, marshalls of the kingdom of Naples or officers of high rank in the royal navy (Marine royale) in France. They were also counts of Ariano, sovereign counts of Forcalquier, counts of Sabran, then of Sabran- Pontev\u00e8s, baron of Ansouis, peers of France et dukes. La family was re\u00e7eived to the Honneurs de la Cour.<\\---literal translation, will require research. == Arms and device == The arms of William Ist of Sabran * Arms : De gueules, au silver lion ** The arms of William Ist of Sabran: de gueules, au lion of gold, different than those of his descendants, are in the Salle des croisades (Crusaders' Hall) of the ch\u00e2teau de Versailles.
