    "text": "Fulgham v. State, 46 Ala. 143 (1871), was a case in which the Supreme Court of Alabama found that a husband has no right to inflict personal chastisement on his wife. According to some commentators, decisions like Fulgham v. State and Harris v. State14 So. 266 (Miss. 1894) (another case involving a black man) were not the result of feminist agency or borne out of a desire to protect women, but were intended to disempower black men:https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0zs890k1 \"Though the text of the Fulgham opinion addresses gender relations, the case seems to resonate with racial preoccupations.\" ==Background== According to the court, ==Ruling== The court ruled, \"The wife is not to be considered as the husband's slave. And the privilege, ancient though it be, to beat her with a stick, to pull her hair, choke her, spit in her face or kick her about the floor, or to inflict upon her like indignities, is not now acknowledged by our law.\" It also noted that \"the rule of love has superseded the rule of force.\"https://flaglerlive.com/wp-content/uploads/Fulghamv.State_.pdf ==References== Category:1871 in United States case law Category:United States family case law ",
