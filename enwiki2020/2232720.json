Construction began on 12 December that year, and the contract was awarded to Nishimatsu-Lum Chang Joint Venture.Nishimatsu awarded joint venture for the construction of Bugis and Lavender stations The contract for the construction and completion of Bugis station and its associated tunnels was awarded to Soletanche Bachy \u2013 Koh Brothers Joint Venture for approximately S$582 million in November 2008. To facilitate the construction of the station, the Rochor Road was realigned, and the former DHL Balloon and the New 7th Storey Hotel was demolished.New DTL Station at Bugis On 18 July 2012, two Chinese workers died after a temporary scaffolding, about high, used for the construction of the new Downtown line Bugis station subway link roof slab gave way. The incident happened at about 6.50 am. The eight other injured workers who were working on top of the structure, were sent to the nearby Raffles Hospital before rescuers arrived. Seven of the injured were from Bangladesh while the eighth was from China. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) ordered all construction work to stop, while the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) revoked the construction permit for the site while investigations were underway. MOM said that based on preliminary information gathered, workers were pouring concrete, also known as the casting process, into the formwork when the structure supporting the formwork collapsed. The formwork, located between the new and old sections of the station, was part of the structure being built to form the underground linkway, which is about three to four metres deep. The area affected is localised, measuring about five metres by 10 metres and the entire station is about 7,500 square metres. The Land Transport Authority said the station structure is substantially complete and structurally sound, and that the incident posed no risk to surrounding developments and the public. ==QR code shopping wall== Similar to the shopping wall at Seolleung station in the Seoul Metropolitan Subway in Seoul, South Korea, this is an interactive media launched on 7 December 2011 by SMRT in partnership with Cold Storage to enhance the commuters' travelling experience.
