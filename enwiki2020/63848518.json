    "text": "Eug\u00e8ne Goyet (7 February 1798\u20147 May 1857), was a French artist. Beginning in 1827 his work was regularly selected for exhibition in the annual Paris Salon. He achieved his greatest success as a painter of religious subjects, with his paintings of Christ and various saints installed in churches and public buildings across France. A successful portrait painter, his most prestigious commission was his 1847 portrait of Pope Pius IX. He was the son of self- taught artist Jean-Baptiste Goyet, and husband of the pastel portrait artist Zo\u00e9 Goyet. ==Career== Foulques de Villaret, grand ma\u00eetre des hospitaliers de Saint-Jean de J\u00e9rusalem de 1307 \u00e0 1327, c. 1841, Salles des Croisades, Palace of Versailles.Having shown an aptitude for drawing, Goyet was sent at the age of eighteen to Paris to receive formal training. Eug\u00e8ne ranked at the top of his class of sixty students at the atelier of Antoine-Jean Gros.Audiffred, Hyacinthe. \"N\u00e9crologie: Eug\u00e8ne Goyet\", Revue des Beaux-Arts, tome 8, 1857, pp. 237-8. At some point Goyet's parents also moved to Paris, with the family taking up residence at 3 Rue de l'Abbaye. Father and son were to have a close lifelong relationship, residing at the same address and working in the same studio. They made their debuts at the Paris Salon in the same year, 1827, when Jean-Baptiste was 48 and Eug\u00e8ne was 29. From that point, both Goyets regularly had works selected for exhibition in the Salons, as did Eug\u00e8ne's wife, Zo\u00e9, a portrait artist who specialized in pastels. In 1837, after the Goyets moved to 25 Rue de la Chaus\u00e9e-D'Antin, they set up their studios next door at number 27, where Eug\u00e8ne and Zo\u00e9 also taught drawing and painting to female students.Le Charivari, 24 December 1837 p. 7. At least one graduate of Zo\u00e9's atelier exhibited at the Paris Salon, in 1864.Veuve Victoire-Ad\u00e8le Keuler, \"\u00e9l\u00e8ve de Mme. Goyet,\" Explication des Ouvrages de Peinture et Dessins, Sculpture, Architecture et Gravure des Artistes Vivans, aux Palais des \u00c9lys\u00e9es, 1864, p. 599. A high point of Goyet's career was his trip to Rome in 1847, where he was commissioned to paint Pope Pius IX. The painting was purchased by the state under Napoleon III and installed at the Palais des Tuileries. Goyet's final, unfinished work was Le massacre des Innocents, which was posthumously exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1857 and reviewed by Jules Verne: > M. Goyet, que la mort a si fatalement surpris au milieu de ses travaux, se > rappellerait au souvenir, s\u2019il \u00e9tait de ceux qu\u2019on p\u00fbt oublier, par un grand > tableau malheureusement inachev\u00e9 ; il repr\u00e9sente le Massacre des Innocents. > Jamais ce sujet, un peu vulgaire, n\u2019a peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 plus > dramatiquement ; la sc\u00e8ne est vaste, les \u00e9pisodes y sont nombreux et vari\u00e9s, > et rendent bien toutes les situations possibles de cette \u00e9pouvantable > boucherie. M. Goyet avait bien peu de choses \u00e0 faire pour terminer cette > belle \u0153uvre, il n\u2019aura malheureusement pu jouir de son succ\u00e8s; c\u2019est > l\u2019\u00e9ternelle loi du Sic vos non vobis! M. Goyet, whom death has so fatally > surprised in the midst of his work, would be remembered, if he were one of > those we could forget, by a large, regrettably unfinished painting; it > represents The Massacre of the Innocents. Never has this somewhat vulgar > subject been treated more dramatically; the scene is vast, the episodes are > numerous and varied, and render all the possible situations of this > appalling butchery. Mr. Goyet had very little to do to finish this beautiful > work, but unfortunately could not enjoy its success; it is the eternal law > of Sic vos non vobis! ==Legacy== In an obituary, the critic Hyacinthe Audiffred wrote: \"It was in the insatiable contemplation of immortal interpreters of art, in the poetry of solitude, that he loved to meditate and create his beautiful images of the Virgin, Christ and martyrs, drawing inspiration from the graceful or dramatic memories of Guide, Poussin and Murillo.\" Eug\u00e8ne Goyet died less than three years after his father; their Salon careers were essentially parallel, beginning and ending together. In 1859, Zo\u00e9 Goyet completed her husband's final commission\u2014of a painting of Christ at Calvary, for La chapelle Notre- Dame du Calvaire, Garbriac, Averyon, France\u2014marking the end of over three decades in which the three Goyets played a prominent role in the world of French art. Zo\u00e9 died in 1869. Goyet's imaginary portrait of Foulques de Villaret, displayed since the 1840s in the Salles des Croisades at the Palace of Versailles, is perhaps his best-known work today. Goyet exhibited a portrait of his father at the Salon of 1833, for which he received a medal, and exhibited a self-portrait in 1838. The location of these paintings is unknown. ==Gallery== File:Eugene Goyet--portrait--Louise Bechet--c-1840-- Maison de Balzac.jpg|Louise B\u00e9chet, c.1840, Maison de Balzac, Paris.
