    "text": "Bottle It In is the eighth studio album by American musician Kurt Vile, released on October 12, 2018 through Matador Records. It features contributions from Kim Gordon, Cass McCombs, Stella Mozgawa of Warpaint, and Mary Lattimore. The album was preceded by the singles \"Loading Zones\" and \"Bassackwards\". ==Songs== \"Hysteria\" was written en route to a recording session. Both \"Hysteria\" and \"Cold Was the Wind\" reference Vile's fear of flying. Vile started writing \"Mutinies\" as a teenager, expanding it and rewriting sections numerous times over the ensuing decades. ==Recording== The album was recorded with various producers in numerous studios and cities across the United States in between Vile's touring schedule. Vile recounted: \"I'd go into the studio straight from tour for a day or so, sometimes by myself, sometimes with a band. Go on trips in between or combine different things, like tour into the studio, into meeting my family, into travelling across the country and back into the studio. Combining all things, not compartmentalising as much, keeping it all like everyday life.\" ==Critical reception== According to review aggregator Metacritic, Bottle It In has received an average score of 78 based on reviews from 24 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Sam Sodomsky of Pitchfork deemed the highlight of the album to be second single \"Bassackwards\", which he called \"10 minutes of warped, psychedelic folk-rock, like a long sigh in the face of existential dread\". Sodomsky noted that the album has a loose structure with \"more accessible tracks up front and a meditative, somewhat indulgent back-half\", and summarized that the album feels like Vile is lost in an \"in-between moment\". ==Track listing== All songs written by Kurt Vile with the exception of \"Rollin' with the Flow\" which was written by Jerry Hayes.
