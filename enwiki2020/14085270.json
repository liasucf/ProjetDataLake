    "text": "James Albert Hard (July 15, 1843 - March 12, 1953) was the last verified living Union combat veteran of the American Civil War and the third-to-last verified veteran overall; only drummer-boys Frank H. Mayer and Albert Woolson post-deceased him. Though he claimed to have been born in 1841,The Last Surviving Veterans of America's Wars - Obituaries, Biographies, Pictures and other Data research in 2006 found that the 1850 Census indicated a birthdate of 1843. He died in Rochester, New York, at the claimed age of 111.James A. Hard Obituary Census research indicates, however, that he was probably a year or two younger and may have inflated his age to gain service. He is recorded as having joined the Union Army on May 14, 1861, aged '19.' The 1850, 1910 and 1920 censuses, however, indicate that he was born in 1843 and 1842. Hard served with the 32nd New York Volunteer Infantry as \"Albert,\" participating in the battles of First Bull Run, Antietam, Chancellorsville, and Fredericksburg. The regiment's term of service expired before the Gettysburg Campaign.https://dmna.ny.gov/historic/reghist/civil/rosters/Infantry/32nd_Infantry_CW_Roster.pdf He claimed to have met Abraham Lincoln at a White House reception.The Chicago Tribune, March 12, 1953, transcribed by K.
