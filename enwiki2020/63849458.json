He was a prolific illustrator of both books and magazines and illustrated about 200 books during his career. He also kept painting and exhibited his work frequently. Rainey also wrote and illustrated six books himself, one was a colourful book for young children, the other five were juvenile fiction. ==Early life== Rainey was born in Kennington, London, on 21 July 1852. He was the third of eight children of the distinguished anatomist and teacher George Rainey (180116 November 1884) and Martha Dee, a farmer's daughter (c. 1827 27 May 1905). Rainey's parents were married at the parish church in Twyning, Gloucestershire, England on 31 December 1846. Rainey was originally intended for a career at sea, but his father, who had himself run away from an early apprenticeship, allowed him instead to study at the South Kensington School of Art. The 1871 census shows that, by the time Rainey was 18, he was a student at the Royal Academy. ==Marriage and family== Rainey married Harriet Matilda Bennett, (12 February 1860c. March 1919), the daughter of Thomas Bennett, a civil engineer, at the Parish Church of St George the Martyr, Holborn, London on 11 June 1877. The couple had four children: *Florence Harriet Bennett (18781959), who was his executor at his death in 1936 *Edith Elsie Rainey(18821896), who died as a teenager *George William Bennett Rainey (Q2 18861956), Shown as assisting his father in the 1911 census. *Victor Thomas James Rainey (Q3 188930 September 1917), a Second Lieutenant in the Devonshire Regiment, killed at Ypres in the First World War. ==Later life== Rainey's wife died in Eastbourne in the second quarter of 1919. The local newspaper recalled that Rainey had moved to Eastbourne about this time, and it was the Eastbourne address that the War Office used in the correspondence about the Medals awarded to his son Victor. Raines was walking on Grand Parade on the sea-front promenade at Eastborne on 24 January 1935 when he collapsed and died before a doctor could be called. He was only a short distance from his home at Avonmore, 24 Granville Road. His daughter Florence Harriet was the executor of his will. His estate was valued at just under \u00a3400. ==Works== The Market Boat (1901).

Rainey won medals for watercolours both the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago and the 1900 Paris Exhibition.

Peppin stated that His delicate brush strokes reproduced well in both colour and halftone. She also noted that Thorpe considered him a great but unrecognised illustrator who was \u2018never conventional in his designs, had a fine sense of character, and maintained the interest throughout the whole of the drawing. Newbolt noted that Rainey He had a long and successful career as a book illustrator, which continued right up to the end of his life. His obituary in stated that many a small boy who has gazed with speechless admiration at some new gift book has been unconsciously grateful to Mr Rainey, for a great deal of his early work was the illustrating of boys' books.
