    "text": "Alabama's at-large congressional district was a congressional district for the United States House of Representatives in Alabama active at various times from 1819 to 1965. Alabama became a state in 1819, and its single representative to the 16th and 17th Congresses was elected at-large. For the 27th Congress, all five of Alabama's representatives were elected at-large, before the state gained a representative from the 1840 census. In the 43rd to 44th Congresses, the seventh and eighth representatives gained in the 1870 census were elected at-large. For the 63rd and 64th Congresses, Alabama elected the tenth of its apportioned representatives, gained in the 1910 census, at-large from the entire state. For the 88th Congress, after the state lost one representative in the 1960 census, Alabama once again elected all of their representatives at-large. == List of members representing the district == {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\" ! rowspan=2 colspan=2 | Congress & Years ! rowspan=2 | ! colspan=2 | 1st Seat ! rowspan=2 | ! colspan=2 | 2nd Seat ! rowspan=2 | ! colspan=2 | 3rd Seat ! rowspan=2 | ! colspan=2 | 4th Seat ! rowspan=2 | ! colspan=2 | 5th Seat ! rowspan=2 | ! colspan=2 | 6th Seat ! rowspan=2 | ! colspan=2 | 7th Seat ! rowspan=2 | ! colspan=2 | 8th Seat |- style=\"height:3em\" !
