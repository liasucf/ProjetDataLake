Oneco is in the Orangeville Community Unit School district. ==History== This small town was settled in its present place because it was at the bottom of a basin, which helped protect them from the harsh winter winds. Native Americans came and helped settle the village, in an attempt to make peace with the settlers and have shelter for the winter as well. ==References== ==External links== *NACo Category:Unincorporated communities in Stephenson County, Illinois Category:Unincorporated communities in Illinois ",
