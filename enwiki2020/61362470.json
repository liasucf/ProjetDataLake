It depicts the high priest Coresus plunging a knife into his body, sacrificing himself to save his lover Callirhoe, who has fainted. The painting was exhibited at the Salon of 1765 and earned Fragonard entry into the Acad\u00e9mie Royale. It is now in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris. Later, Fragonard created a loose chalk sketch of the same scene but at a smaller scale. This drawing is currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City. == References == Category:Paintings by Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard Category:1765 paintings Category:Paintings of the Louvre by French artists ",
