    "text": "The Government of the Australian Capital Territory, also referred to as the Australian Capital Territory Government or ACT Government, is the executive authority of the Australian Capital Territory, one of the territories of Australia. The leader of the party or coalition with the confidence of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly forms Government. Unlike the Australian States and the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly directly elects one of their number to be the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory as the head of the Government, rather than being appointed by a Governor or Administrator. Since December 2014, the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory has been Andrew Barr, leader of the Labor Party. Following the 2016 ACT election the Government has been formed by a coalition of twelve Labor members and two Greens members. The terms of the coalition are outlined in the Parliamentary Agreement for the 9th Legislative Assembly for the Australian Capital Territory. Ministers are appointed by the Chief Minister. The current ministry of the Australian Capital Territory (Second Barr Ministry) comprises eight of the twenty five Members of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly. ==Constitutional framework== The ACT has internal self-government, but Australia's Constitution does not afford the territory government the full legislative independence provided to Australian states. Government for the Australian Capital Territory is outlined in Commonwealth legislation; the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988. Nonetheless, the ACT is governed according to the principles of the Westminster System, a form of parliamentary government based on the model of the United Kingdom. Legislative power rests with the unicameral Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly. Executive power rests formally with the Executive, which consists of the Chief Minister and Ministers, and is informally called the Cabinet. Judicial power is exercised by the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory and a system of subordinate courts, but the High Court of Australia and other federal courts have overriding jurisdiction on matters which fall under the ambit of the Australian Constitution. The ACT does not have a separate system of local government such as that seen in the Australian States and the Northern Territory. In the ACT, government functions that would usually be handled by local government are instead directly handled by the Territory government. ==Current Ministry== The current arrangement of the incumbent ministry (Second Barr Ministry) of the ACT was appointed on 26 August 2019, comprising seven Labor Party members and one Greens member. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
