In 2005, Sky Publishing Corporation was acquired by New Track Media, a portfolio company of the private equity firm Boston Ventures. In 2014, New Track was sold to F+W Media. . Following the mid 2019 bankruptcy of F+W media, the magazine was sold to the American Astronomical Society. The magazine played an important role in the dissemination of knowledge about telescope making, through the column \"Gleanings for ATMs\" that ran from 1933 to 1990.
