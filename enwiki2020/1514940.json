He attended Provine High School in Jackson, and played for the Provine rams high school football team. He was selected to play in the Mississippi-Alabama high school all-star game as a senior. ==College career== Smoot attended Mississippi State University, where he played for the Mississippi State Bulldogs football team from 1997 to 2000.

Many believed he was a first-round caliber player but because of questionable off-the-field problems many teams shied away from him. Afterwards, he proclaimed himself to be the steal of the draft. In Smoot's four years with the Redskins, he collected 16 interceptions, and formed an impressive duo with Champ Bailey. ===Minnesota Vikings=== Following a strong season as part of the impressive Redskins defense in 2004, Smoot left the club as a free agent to sign with the Minnesota Vikings. However, he was not able to duplicate his success in Minnesota. Smoot reportedly bulked up in the 2006 offseason. His playing weight was listed at 178 lb for the 2005 season and in May 2006 the press reported he weighed about 200 lb. He faced very stiff competition for the starting spot since the Vikings drafted cornerback Cedric Griffin in the second round and cornerback Ronyell Whitaker was named All NFL Europa. In the third game of the season against Chicago, Smoot sat out the opening drive reportedly for discipline reasons. Coach Brad Childress said that was between him and Smoot. In the 11th game of the season, Smoot was benched in favor of starting Griffin instead. Childress said the switch was merited in performance and Griffin had been doing an excellent job. ====Love Boat scandal==== Smoot was at the center of the 2005 Minnesota Vikings boat cruise scandal involving several of his Minnesota Vikings' teammates. Some Vikings players had rented a boat on Lake Minnetonka and reportedly hired prostitutes to have a \"sex party\" on the boat. Smoot allegedly held a purple double-headed dildo and inserted it into the vaginas of two women who were lying on the floor in the lounge area. After one woman left, he continued to \"manipulate the dildo\" inside the other woman in front of the young crew. Formal charges for the Boat Scandal were filed on December 15. Smoot was also alleged to have organized the whole party, an accusation he denied. On May 2, 2006, Smoot pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and being a public nuisance on a watercraft in connection with the Love Boat scandal. He agreed to pay a $1,007 fine and perform 48 hours of community service. Vikings owner Zygi Wilf said, in addition to community service, he would participate in numerous service events this season. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said fines were likely, but Smoot would not be suspended. On September 9, 2006, the NFL imposed a fine equivalent to one game's salary against Smoot and former Vikings teammate Bryant McKinnie for their role in the Love Boat scandal, Smoot's fine was $82,352.
