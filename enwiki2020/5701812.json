Henri d'Ursel was known for his surrealist style, directing the film La Perle early in his career. == Family== Henri d'Ursel was born in Brussels, son of the 7th duke of Ursel. During the 1920s, he lived in Paris at the height of the surrealist and avant-garde movements. He married to princess Antoinette, the daughter of Louis Charles Marie de La Tr\u00e9moille, the 10th Duke of Thouars. He became the brother-in-law of Charlotte de La Tr\u00e9moille and Louis Jean Marie de La Tr\u00e9moille. They both separated and the marriage was annulled in Rome on 5 June 1936.\u00c9tat pr\u00e9sent de la noblesse belge, Annuaire 2013, Brussel, 2013 p.5 After he inherited D'Ursel Castle he decided in 1970 to sell the large family estate, since generations in the family.https://www.kasteeldursel.be/over/het-interieur-van-kasteel-dursel.html In 1973 the local government of Hingene acquired the ducal estate for \u20ac372,000. He left the castle completely empty after he took all the valuable furniture out and deposed the complete family archive in the National Archives of Brussels. He was succeeded by his son Antonin, 9th Duke d'Ursel. The current Duke of Ursel, St\u00e9phane, is his grandson. == Film career == In 1929 he wrote La Perle, under the pseudonym \"Henri d'Arches\" (the duke of Ursel is Prince of Arches and Charleville), based on a story by Georges Hugnet. Of the filmmaking experience, D'Ursel later said it was made \"in the flush of inexperience.\" Returning to Belgium, in 1937 d'Ursel and Louis Camu founded Le Prix de l\u2019Image, a precursor to film festivals of experimental cinema. At the outbreak of World War II, he and Luc Haesaerts founded Le S\u00e9minaire des Arts, a prestigious Belgian film club, and precursor of the Mus\u00e9e du cin\u00e9ma de Bruxelles. D'Ursel was a friend of both Charles Dekeukeleire and Henri Storck.
