The defendant used Moberg's photos as stock photos in some of their website designs. When the cease-and- desist was ignored H\u00e5kan Moberg sued 33T over copyright infringement and violation of the DMCA.Exclusive Rights: Court finds that putting photos on the internet doesn\u2019t make them U.S. works The defendant claimed that by making the images available online they would be published in the United States and that would make it a United States work, and that they needed to be registered with the United States Copyright Office. The court rejected that and said that it would \"overextend and pervert\" U.S. copyright law and be contrary to the goals of the Berne Convention. The court also stated that if anything published online was a US work it would make US citizens able to infringe foreign works without fear of retribution and that it would be contrary to US copyright law: \"the United States copyright laws, in accord with the Berne Convention, provide for protection of foreign works in the United States without requiring the artists to undertake any formalities in the United States\".Moberg v. 33T LLC et al, No. 1:2008cv00625 - Document 24 (D.
