It is employed by U.S. Military Joint Services, NATO and some law enforcement agencies. It is designed to operate over bandwidth-restricted circuits such as UHF and VHF satellite access and wideband switched telephone systems. It uses the 16 kbit/s continuously variable slope delta modulation (CVSD). The system was initially fielded as a replacement for the KG-36 and KG-34. The unit fits in a five-inch cube and weighs about 5 pounds. Production ended in 1993. ==See also== * KY-57 * KY-68 ==References== ==External links== * KY-58 (Vinson) by Jerry Proc * Interactive KY-58 graphics explaining the controls Category:National Security Agency encryption devices ",
