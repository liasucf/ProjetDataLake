He has taught all over the U.S. in places like the University of Florida, Florida State, University of Colorado, Indiana University, Eastern Michigan University and Wisconsin University. Radelet has lectured and taught: Mental Health Administration, Sociology of Mental Health and Illnesses, Criminology, Special Topics on Capital Punishment, and Human Development. == Research and findings == Radelet throughout his career has studied the impact that the death penalty has on the mind, and on society. In the midst of the ongoing debate on whether or not the death penalty is more deterrent than long-term imprisonment, Radelet's studies revealed findings that could alter the system. His works surveyed many, coming up with multiple conclusions regarding the issue, these results are displayed in his article 'Do Executions Lower Homicide Rates: The Views of Leading Criminologists.' One of the main statistics projected in this article states that 88% of criminologists do not believe that capital punishment is an effective deterrent to homicide. Radelet's knowledge in Psychology and Criminology helped him produce his book \"Facing the Death Penalty.\" This book portrays what Michael experienced while working with those who are facing the death penalty. It talks a lot about the benefits and inhumanities of the death penalty and how Radelet's experience may change people\u2019s views. === Racial disparities === Radelet has uncovered many facts and statistics relating to the problem of racial disparities in the federal death penalty. He has statistics dating back to 1991 during the first federal death penalty prosecution. In the history of those who were prosecuted and sentenced to the death penalty, most were of color. These injustices continue today, more and more whites are able to evade the death penalty better than blacks. These injustices revealed by Radelet made the notion that racism is apparent in the justice system. These studies triggered an uprising of debate on whether the death penalty is a fair punishment. ==Notes== ==External links== * Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:University of Colorado Boulder faculty Category:American sociologists Category:Sociology educators Category:University of Florida faculty Category:Michigan State University alumni Category:Eastern Michigan University alumni Category:Purdue University alumni ",
