    "text": "Pinus nelsonii, Nelson's pinyon, is a species of pine native to the mountains of northeastern Mexico, in Nuevo Le\u00f3n, San Luis Potos\u00ed and Tamaulipas at 1,800\u20133,200 m altitude. It has very singular characteristics and is not closely related to any other pines in either morphologyShaw, G. R. (1904). Pinus nelsonii. Gard. Chron. ser.3, 36: 122, f.49.Grimshaw, J., & Bayton, R.

It is placed in subgenus Strobus either in its own section Nelsonia or subsection Nelsoniae. : > \"Pinus nelsonii is exceptional.

Quinquefoliae when midpoint > rooting is employed.\" It is a small tree growing to 10 m tall with a trunk up to 20\u201330 cm diameter. The crown is rounded and dense, and resembles that of the unrelated Pinus pinea from the western Mediterranean. The needles are produced in fascicles of three (occasionally four), but 'zipped' together by their finely serrated margins so that they look like a single needle; they can only be separated by force.Bailey, D.K. and F.G. Hawksworth. 1988. Phytogeography and taxonomy of the pinyon pines. Pp. 41-64 in M.-F. Passini et al. (eds.), Il Simposio Nacional sobre pinos pi\u00f1oneros. CEMCA, Chapingo, Mexico D.F. They are 4\u20138 (rarely 10) cm long and 0.7\u20131 mm thick, sub-shiny dark green in colour, with a persistent grey basal sheath 7\u20139 mm long. The cones are cylindrical, 6\u201312 cm long and 4\u20135 cm broad, orange-brown to red-brown colour, with 60\u2013100 scales with large but indistinct umbos, and carried on a stout downcurved peduncle 3\u20136 cm long. Unlike all other pines, their growth while immature does not pause during the first winter. The seeds are large, 12\u201315 mm, red-brown. The cones mature in November after rain season. It grows in a semi-arid temperate climate with summer rainfall and is very drought-tolerant.Farjon, A. & Styles, B. T. (1997). Pinus (Pinaceae). Flora Neotropica Monograph 75. The seeds are edible and delicious, and are very appreciated by people in the region. They are so valuable that they are transported to the markets of Mexico City. Because of its seeds, it has been very devastated by people. Only recently it has been cultivated outside its native range, grown more for its botanical curiosity than for ornamental values. The scientific name is occasionally cited incorrectly as Pinus nelsoni; the correct ending is -ii. ==References== nelsonii Category:Edible nuts and seeds Category:Trees of Nuevo Le\u00f3n Category:Trees of San Luis Potos\u00ed Category:Trees of Tamaulipas Category:Drought-tolerant trees ",
