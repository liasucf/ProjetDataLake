    "text": "The First Annual Report is a bootleg album of music recorded by industrial music pioneers Throbbing Gristle in 1975. The recording originally went unreleased, and the band instead decided to release The Second Annual Report in 1977. This recording was first released unofficially in 1987 as Very Friendly through Spurt Records, before being issued prominently as The First Annual Report in 2001. == Background == Throbbing Gristle's first album was recorded in 1975 but went unreleased. Instead, the band opted to release The Second Annual Report. According to AllMusic, \"this legendary recording [...] reached an almost mythical status in the industrial music scene until its belated issue in 2001\" as The First Annual Report. == Release history == The recording has been bootlegged several times, released under titles such as Very Friendly and Final Muzak. Its most notable release came in 2001 as The First Annual Report, released in the UK through Yeaah! Records and in the US through Thirsty Ear. == Critical reception == AllMusic called the album \"a milestone in subversive music matched only by Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music\". Pitchfork praised the album's originality, but gave it a low grade in terms of listenability. == Legacy == AllMusic called the album \"undeniably the most important advent in the roots of industrial music. [...] Practically every act within industrial music and its offshoots \u2013 be it Merzbow, Whitehouse, Ministry, Big Black or Godflesh \u2013 owes an incredible debt to the groundbreaking music of Throbbing Gristle.\" Pitchfork, too, opined, \"This record is essentially the birth of industrial music, packed with samples, abrasive, irregular beats, manipulated loops and Cosey Fanni Tutti's often unrecognizable guitar. Nurse with Wound, Cabaret Voltaire, Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten, Skinny Puppy, Controlled Bleeding and Acid Bath are just a few of the outfits that owe a huge debt to Throbbing Gristle's unrelenting assault.\" == Track listing == == References == == External links == * Category:Throbbing Gristle albums Category:2001 albums ",
