Completed in 1937, it stands next to the same architect's Sloane Avenue Mansions, built a few years earlier. ==History== In the 1840s, there was a house on the site of Nell Gwynn House in which the member of parliament George Thompson lived. A blue plaque added to the side of the present building in 2013 commemorates Thompson being visited there in 1846 by the notable American Frederick Douglass. At the beginning of the 20th century, this area of Chelsea contained run-down or derelict housing, and by the 1930s the area was being redeveloped.Brian Girling, Chelsea Through Time (Amberley Publishing, Stroud, 2015, ), p. 137 The Victoria County History notes that by the end of the decade the district was \"filled with housing for the better off, a curious mixture of select, consciously picturesque low houses and enormous and forbidding blocks of flats, either cautiously Art Deco or approximately neoGeorgian in style.\" It continues: With a footprint forming a giant capital W, the building's geometric design is Cubist, making use of Egyptian, Aztec, and Mayan patterns and materials. From the outset, each apartment had built-in central heating, there was a restaurant in the basement, a hairdressing salon, and a bar in the lobby.Nell Gwynn Chelsea homepage, accessed 25 July 2016 In 1937, Country Life carried an advertisement - In 1948, a music club was established, with Sir Adrian Boult as President, and was patronised by Vaughan Williams, Arnold Bax, and John Ireland. In 1966, A. G. Ogden described Nell Gwynn House as a \"pied a terre for many Chelsea bachelors who honor the spirit of Charles II.Archibald G.

The landlord had wanted to increase the rent to \u00a35 5s a week, but the Tribunal imposed rents of \u00a34-1s-6d and \u00a34-2s-6d in the two cases.The Estates Gazette Digest of Land and Property Cases 1946 (Estates Gazette, 1947), pp. 36-39: \"Chelsea, Holborn and Westminster Rent Tribunal \u2014 Mr. C.

M. Stationery Office, 1966), p. 198 Since 2006, the Trustees of the building have undertaken a major refurbishment, inside and out, including the renovation of more than half of the apartments and the restoration of the Art-Deco features in the reception and public areas, by interior designer Tim Gosling. In 2010, NGH Freehold Ltd, a management company representing about three-quarters of the lessees, bought the freehold (see collective enfranchisement) which lowered the cost for the lessees of licences to make any major alterations or other works. At the time of the sale to NGH Freehold Ltd, this was the largest UK collective enfranchisement. In 2020, a fifth-floor one-bedroom flat was for sale with a 999-year lease expiring in 3009. With a size of 316 square feet, it had an annual service charge of \u00a33854 and council tax of \u00a31237. The front door entered a living room (with a small kitchen in one corner) fifteen by thirteen and a half feet. Opening off that was a bedroom ten feet by eight and a half, and a small bathroom.

This stands at the foot of an alcove six storeys high, topped by an art deco set of reliefs, and is hard to see from Sloane Avenue, so is mostly unnoticed by the traffic, but it is believed to be the only statue of a royal mistress anywhere in the capital city.Rooftop statues at knowledgeoflondon.com/rooftops, accessed 13 January 2018 ==Notable residents== *Frank Foley (1884\u20131958), Secret Intelligence Service officer who helped many Jewish families to escape from Germany in the 1930sMichael Smith, Foley: the Spy who Saved 10,000 Jews (2016), p. 177 *Daisy Burrell (1892\u20131982), actress of the silent film era, lived in flat 203 as Daisy YoungProbate index for 1982 at probatesearch.gov.uk, accessed 22 July 2016: \"Young, Daisy Isobel Eaglesfield Ratton otherwise Daisy Isobel Eaglesfield of 203 Nell Gwynn House Sloane Av London SW3 died 10 June 1982.\" *Vera Atkins (1908\u20132000), Romanian-born Intelligence Officer of the Second World War occupied Flat 725 between 1940 and 1950 *Theyre Lee-Elliott (1903\u20131988), artist, designer of the BOAC Speedbird *Samuel Hughes (1913\u20132002), Canadian field historian, during Second World WarSam Hughes, Steering the Course: A Memoir (McGill-Queen's Press, 2000), Chapter 10 *Diana Dors (1931\u20131984) English film actress and singer. *Roy James (1935\u20131997), one of the Great Train robbers, was living in flat 907 at the time of the robbery in 1963 *Bruce Forsyth (1928\u20132017), entertainer occupied Flat 832 until 2000 * Tina Moore, first wife of footballer Bobby Moore In February 2013, a blue plaque was unveiled by Barbara J.
