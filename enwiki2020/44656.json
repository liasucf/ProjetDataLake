    "text": "Domenico Scarlatti in a portrait by Domingo Antonio Velasco (1738) Giuseppe Domenico Scarlatti, also known as Domingo or Dom\u00e9nico Scarlatti; (Naples 26 October 1685 Madrid, 23 July 1757) was an Italian composer. He is classified primarily as a Baroque composer chronologically, although his music was influential in the development of the Classical style. Like his renowned father Alessandro Scarlatti, he composed in a variety of musical forms, although today he is known mainly for his 555 keyboard sonatas. He spent much of his life in the service of the Portuguese and Spanish royal families. ==Life and career == Domenico Scarlatti was born in Naples, Kingdom of Naples, belonging to the Spanish Crown. He was born in 1685, the same year as Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel. Scarlatti was the sixth of ten children of the composer and teacher Alessandro Scarlatti. His older brother Pietro Filippo was also a musician. Scarlatti first studied music under his father. Other composers who may have been his early teachers include Gaetano Greco, Francesco Gasparini, and Bernardo Pasquini, all of whom may have influenced his musical style. Muzio Clementi brought Scarlatti's sonatas into the classical style by editing what is known to be its first publication. He was appointed as composer and organist at the royal chapel in Naples in 1701. In 1703, he revised Carlo Francesco Pollarolo's opera Irene for performance at Naples. Soon afterward, his father sent him to Venice. After this, nothing is known of Scarlatti's life until 1709, when he went to Rome and entered the service of the exiled Polish queen Marie Casimire. It was in Rome that he met Thomas Roseingrave. Scarlatti was already an accomplished harpsichordist: there is a story of a trial of skill with George Frideric Handel at the palace of Cardinal Ottoboni in Rome where he was judged possibly superior to Handel on the harpsichord, although inferior on the organ. Scarlatti has been heralded as the \"greatest Italian harpsichord composer of all time\". Later in life, Scarlatti was known to cross himself in veneration when speaking of Handel's skill. While in Rome, Scarlatti composed several operas for Queen Casimire's private theatre. He was Maestro di Cappella at St. Peter's from 1715 to 1719. In 1719 he traveled to London to direct his opera Narciso at the King's Theatre. Detail of a painting by Gaspare Traversi, showing Scarlatti tutoring Princess Barbara of Portugal According to Vicente Bicchi, Papal Nuncio in Portugal at the time, Domenico Scarlatti arrived in Lisbon on 29 November 1719. There he taught music to the Portuguese princess Maria Magdalena Barbara. He left Lisbon on 28 January 1727 for Rome, where he married Maria Caterina Gentili on 6 May 1728. In 1729 he moved to Seville, staying for four years. In 1733 he went to Madrid as a music master to Princess Maria Barbara, who had married into the Spanish royal house. The Princess later became Queen of Spain. Scarlatti remained in the country for the remaining twenty-five years of his life and had five children there. After the death of his first wife in 1739, he married a Spaniard, Anastasia Maxarti Ximenes. Among his compositions during his time in Madrid were most of the 555 keyboard sonatas for which he is best known. Scarlatti befriended the castrato singer Farinelli, a fellow Neapolitan also enjoying royal patronage in Madrid. The musicologist and harpsichordist Ralph Kirkpatrick commented that Farinelli's correspondence provides \"most of the direct information about Scarlatti that has transmitted itself to our day\". Domenico Scarlatti died in Madrid, at the age of 71. His residence on Calle Leganitos is designated with a historical plaque, and his descendants still live in Madrid. He was buried at a convent there, in Madrid, but his grave no longer exists.

These were well received throughout Europe, and were championed by the foremost English writer on music of the eighteenth century, Charles Burney. The many sonatas that were unpublished during Scarlatti's lifetime have appeared in print irregularly in the two and a half centuries since. Scarlatti has attracted notable admirers, including B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, Pieter-Jan Belder, Johann Sebastian Bach, Muzio Clementi, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Carl Czerny, Franz Liszt, Johannes Brahms, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, Claude Debussy, Emil Gilels, Francis Poulenc, Olivier Messiaen, Enrique Granados, Marc-Andr\u00e9 Hamelin, Vladimir Horowitz, Ivo Pogoreli\u0107, Scott Ross (the first performer to record all 555 sonatas), Heinrich Schenker, Andr\u00e1s Schiff and Dmitri Shostakovich. Scarlatti's 555 keyboard sonatas are single movements, mostly in binary form, and some in early sonata form, and mostly written for the harpsichord or the earliest pianofortes. (There are four for organ, and a few for small instrumental group). Some of them display harmonic audacity in their use of discords, and also unconventional modulations to remote keys. Other distinctive attributes of Scarlatti's style are the following: *The influence of Iberian (Portuguese and Spanish) folk music. An example is Scarlatti's use of the Phrygian mode and other tonal inflections more or less alien to European art music. Many of Scarlatti's figurations and dissonances are suggestive of the guitar. *Scarlatti's compositions were influenced by the Spanish guitar as can be seen in notes being played repetitively in a rapid manner. *A formal device in which each half of a sonata leads to a pivotal point, which Kirkpatrick termed \"the crux\", and which is sometimes underlined by a pause or fermata. Before the crux, Scarlatti sonatas often contain their main thematic variety, and after the crux the music makes more use of repetitive figurations as it modulates away from the home key (in the first half) or back to the home key (in the second half). *Scarlatti played in the galant style. Kirkpatrick produced an edition of the sonatas in 1953, and the numbering from this edition is now nearly always used \u2013 the Kk. or K. number. Previously, the numbering commonly used was from the 1906 edition compiled by the Neapolitan pianist Alessandro Longo (L. numbers). Kirkpatrick's numbering is chronological, while Longo's ordering is a result of his arbitrarily grouping the sonatas into \"suites\". In 1967 the Italian musicologist Giorgio Pestelli published a revised catalog (using P. numbers), which corrected what he considered to be some anachronisms.See List of solo keyboard sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti for a list converting Longo, Kirkpatrick, Pestelli and Czerny numbers of Scarlatti's sonatas. Although the exact dates of composition for these surviving sonatas are not known, Kirkpatrick concludes that they may all have been composed late in Scarlatti's career (after 1735), with the majority perhaps dating from after the composer's sixty-seventh birthday. Aside from his many sonatas, Scarlatti composed a number of operas and cantatas, symphonias, and liturgical pieces. Well-known works include the Stabat Mater of 1715 and the Salve Regina of 1757, which is thought to be his last composition. == Selected discography == === Complete works === * L\u2019\u0152uvre pour clavier, Scott Ross (1988, 34 CDs Erato/Radio France) * Domenico Scarlatti: The Complete Sonatas, Richard Lester, harpsichord & fortepiano (2001\u20132005, 39 CDs in 7 volumes Nimbus Records NI 1725/NI 1741) . * Keyboard Sonatas, Emilia Fadini, Ottavio Dantone, Sergio Vartolo, Marco Farolfi, Enrico Baiano..., harpsichord, fortepiano, organ (1999\u20132012, 12 CDs Stradivarius) \u2013 in progress * Keyboard Sonatas, Pieter-Jan Belder, harpischord & fortepiano (2012, 36 CDs Brilliant Classics) * Keyboard Sonatas, Carlo Grante, B\u00f6sendorfer Imperial piano (2009\u20132020, 35 CDs in 6 volumes Music & Arts) * Keyboard Sonatas, various pianists (1994\u20132019, 22 CDs Naxos) \u2013 in progress === Piano recitals === * 2 Sonatas : Sonata K. 9 and Sonata K. 380 \u2013 Dinu Lipatti, piano (20 February et 27 September 1947, EMI / 12 CDs H\u00e4nssler PH17011) * 4 Sonatas : Sonata K. 1, Sonata K. 87, Sonata K. 193, and Sonata K. 386 \u2013 Clara Haskil, piano (? 1947, BBC / \u00ab In\u00e9dits Haskil \u00bb Tahra TAH 389 / TAH 4025) * 11 Sonatas : Sonata K. 1, Sonate K. 35, Sonata K. 87, Sonata K. 132, Sonata K. 193, Sonata K. 247, Sonata K. 322, Sonata K. 386, Sonata K. 437, Sonata K. 515, Sonata K. 519 \u2013 Clara Haskil, piano (October 1951, Westminster/DG 471 214-2) * 3 Sonatas : Sonata K. 87, Sonata K. 193 and Sonata K. 386 \u2013 Clara Haskil, piano (October 1951, Philips) * The Siena Pianoforte : 6 Scarlatti sonatas (and 3 sonatas of Mozart) \u2013 Charles Rosen, Siena piano (1955, Counterpoint/Esoteric / Everest Records CPT 53000) * 37 Piano Sonatas : Vladimir Horowitz (1946\u20131981, \u00ab Complete Recordings \u00bb RCA and CBS/Sony Classical) * 33 Sonatas : Christian Zacharias, piano (1979, 1981, 1984, EMI) * 18 sonatas : Maria Tipo, piano (27\u201328 November 1987, EMI CDC 7 49078 2) * 15 sonatas : Ivo Pogorelich, piano (September 1991, DG) * Scarlatti: Keyboard Sonatas : Mikhail Pletnev, piano (October 1994, Virgin Classics 5181862) * 16 Sonatas : Christian Zacharias, piano (1995, EMI) * 20 Sonatas : Valerie Tryon, piano (18 and 28 September 1999, Appian Publications & Recordings [APR]) * 14 Sonatas : Christian Zacharias, piano (June 2002, MDG 34011622) * 18 Sonatas : Racha Arodaky, piano (17\u201321 July 2005, Zig-Zag Territoires) * Scarlatti: Piano Sonatas : Yevgeny Sudbin, piano (2005, BIS) * Naples, 1685 : 17 sonatas : Olivier Cav\u00e9, piano (2008, Outhere Music/\u00c6on) * Sonatas : Alice Ader, piano (2010, Fuga Libera) * 42 Sonatas : Michelangelo Carbonara, piano (12\u201314 May 2009, 2CD Brilliant Classics) * Alexandre Tharaud joue Scarlatti : 18 sonatas (30 August/3 September 2010, Virgin Classics) * Scarlatti: 18 Sonatas: Yevgeny Sudbin, piano (2016, BIS) * Scarlatti: 52 Sonatas: Lucas Debargue, piano (2019, Sony Music) === Fortepiano recitals === * Sonate per cembalo, 1742, Francesco Cera, harpsichord & fortepiano (7\u20139 March 2000, March 2001, October 2002, 3 CD Tactus) * Sonatas'\u2019, Sergio Ciomei, harpsichord & fortepiano (28 February 2000, 2\u20133 February 2001, Challenge Classics) * Sonates \u2013 Una nuova inventione per Maria Barbara, Aline Zylberajch, fortepiano after Cristofori (2005, Ambronay) === Harpsichord recitals === * \u2018'Sonatas for Harpsichord, Wanda Landowska (1934, 1939, 1940, EMI) * Keyboard Sonatas'\u2019, Fernando Valenti (1950s, Westminster / 3 CDs Millenium MCA Universal, rereleased. 1998) * Keyboard Sonatas'\u2019, Fernando Valenti (1951\u20131955, 11 CDs Pristine Audio, rereleased. 2006) * 60 Harpsichord Sonatas'\u2019, Ralph Kirkpatrick (1954, CBS SL 221 / 2 CD Urania, rerelease of 54 sonatas in 2004) * \u2018'Harpsichord Sonatas'\u2019, Luciano Sgrizzi, harpsichord (1964, Accord) * 21 Harpsichord Sonatas'\u2019, Ralph Kirkpatrick (1966, 1971, Archiv Produktion, rereleased 2004) * 10 Sonatas, Gustav Leonhardt (1970, Deutsche Harmonia Mundi) * 16 Harpsichord Sonatas, Joseph Payne (1971, Turnabout) * Sonates pour clavecin, Blandine Verlet (1975, Philips) * Sonates pour clavecin, Blandine Verlet (1976, Philips) * 14 Harpsichord Sonatas, Gustav Leonhardt (1979, Seon/Sony) * Harpsichord Sonatas \u2013 Colin Tilney, Vincenzio harpsichord 1782 (August 1979, L'Oiseau-Lyre/Decca) * Harpsichord Sonatas'\u2019, Trevor Pinnock (1981, CRD Records;
