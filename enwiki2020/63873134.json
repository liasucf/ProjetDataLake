    "text": "Tuia 250 was a government-sponsored commemoration for the 250th anniversary of the arrival of Captain Cook on the HMS Endeavour in Aotearoa (now New Zealand) in 1769\u20131770. Highlights of the event were a fleet of Polynesian double-hulled waka and tallships retracing Cook's route and the British High Commissioner delivering an 'expression of regret' to local iwi over the killings of the indigenous M\u0101ori people by Cook and his crew. Some iwi and individuals actively participated in Tuia 250, significant numbers boycotted or otherwise criticised it. ==See also== Sesqui 1990 ==References== Category:2019 in New Zealand Category:Race relations in New Zealand Category:2020 in New Zealand Category:Regional centennial anniversaries ",
