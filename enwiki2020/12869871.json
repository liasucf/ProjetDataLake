His sister is the visual artist Tanoa Sasraku-Ansah, and his brother is musician Ryan Ansah. His uncle is film director Kwaw Ansah. Ansah lived in London for the first 10 years of his life before emigrating with his family to Ghana. There he studied the martial art of Taekwondo for four years and took up hip-hop dance and motorbike racing. At 15 he returned to England, settling with his mother and young sister in Plymouth. While studying for his GCSEs and A-levels at Devonport High School for Boys, he began training in the martial art of Ninpo Taijutsu and eventually earned a black belt in the art. This would include a period of training with Bujinkan Grandmaster Masaaki Hatsumi. Later, while studying for his degree in human biology at Oxford Brookes University, he began training in the Brazilian martial art of Capoeira. He also worked as a model and extra. ==Career== His first important role as an actor was in the UK indie film Love Struck (2005). Notable appearances on British TV followed in episodes of BBC productions Spooks (2005) and Timewatch (2006). Ansah went on to play a minor role as one of the Shadow Warriors in Batman Begins (2005). However, his most noteworthy role to date came in 2007, when he appeared in The Bourne Ultimatum as Desh Bouksani, an assassin tracking down Jason Bourne. Ansah's performance was notable for an extended set-piece fight scene between himself and Matt Damon, regarded by one reviewer as one of the best ever filmed,Bourne Ultimatum: Review, Rolling Stone.

Ansah has also acted in British independent martial arts films, such as Left for Dead and Underground. He choreographed, co-wrote and directed the short film Street Fighter: Legacy.

He and collaborator Christian Howard, with whom he worked on SFL, worked on the live-action Street Fighter series Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist, and they are developing a second season titled Street Fighter: World Warrior and Street Fighter: Resurrection. ==Filmography== * Left for Dead (2004) \u2013 Kickboxer 1 * Batman Begins (2005) as League of Shadows member * Love Struck (2005) \u2013 Mango * Voyage: Killing Brigitte Nielsen (2007) (TV) * The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) \u2013 Desh Bouksani * Underground (2007) \u2013 Joey, The Model * Ghost Town (2009) (TV) \u2013 Bonesera * Hit Girls (2009) \u2013 James * Street Fighter: Legacy (2010) \u2013 Akuma, also co-writer and co-director\"This Could Be The Best Street Fighter Film Ever Created\".
