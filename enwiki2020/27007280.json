Paul Finsler (born 11 April 1894, in Heilbronn, Germany, died 29 April 1970 in Zurich, Switzerland) was a German and Swiss mathematician. Finsler did his undergraduate studies at the Technische Hochschule Stuttgart, and his graduate studies at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where he received his Ph.D. in 1919 under the supervision of Constantin Carath\u00e9odory.. He studied for his habilitation at the University of Cologne, receiving it in 1922. He joined the faculty of the University of Zurich in 1927, and was promoted to ordinary professor there in 1944. Finsler's thesis work concerned differential geometry, and Finsler spaces were named after him by \u00c9lie Cartan in 1934. The Hadwiger\u2013Finsler inequality, a relation between the side lengths and area of a triangle in the Euclidean plane, is named after Finsler and his co-author Hugo Hadwiger, as is the Finsler\u2013Hadwiger theorem on a square derived from two other squares that share a vertex.. Finsler is also known for his work on the foundations of mathematics, developing a non-well-founded set theory with which he hoped to resolve the contradictions implied by Russell's paradox.. ==Publications== * (Reprinted by Birkh\u00e4user (1951)) * * * * *Finsler: Aufs\u00e4tze zur Mengenlehre.
