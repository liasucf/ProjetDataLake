    "text": "D\u00farnir was a dwarf who appears in three Old Norse skaldic poems, which suggests that he once was a well-known dwarf in Norse mythology. The most notable poem is Ynglingatal: {| | :En dagskjarr :D\u00farnis ni\u00f0ja :salv\u00f6r\u00f0u\u00f0r :Sveig\u00f0i v\u00e9tti, :\u00fe\u00e1 er \u00ed stein :enn st\u00f3rge\u00f0i :Dusla konr :ept dvergi hlj\u00f3p, :ok salr bjartr :\u00feeira S\u00f6km\u00edmis :j\u00f6tunbygg\u00f0r :vi\u00f0 j\u00f6fri gein.Ynglinga saga at Norr\u00f8ne Tekster og KvadA second online presentation of Ynglingatal | :By Diurnir's elfin race, :Who haunt the cliffs and shun day's face, :The valiant Swegde was deceived, :The elf's false words the king believed. :The dauntless hero rushing on, :Passed through the yawning mouth of stone: :It yawnedit shutthe hero fell, :In Saekmime's hall, where giants dwell.Laing's translation at the Internet Sacred Text ArchiveLaing's translation at Northvegr | A more literal translation: :The day-fearing :spawn of Durnir :warden of the hall :betrayed Sveigdir :who into stone :the rash hero :ran after the dwarf. :The bright hall :of Soekmimir :built of giants :was enriched :by the chieftain`s presence. |} He also appears in a list of Dwarves in the anonymous Dverga heiti: :Al\u00fej\u00f3fr, austri, :aurvangr ok d\u00fafr, :\u00e1i, andvari, :\u00f3nn ok draupnir, :dori ok dagfinnr, :dulinn ok \u00f3narr, :alfr ok dellingr, :\u00f3inn ok durnir.Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages The third poem is found in Lauf\u00e1s-Edda: :Kve\u00f0a skal hr\u00f3\u00f0r fyr hr\u00ed\u00f0ar :hr\u00e6-blakks vi\u00f0um s\u00e6var, :drykkr var Durnis rekkum :d\u00f8kkr, lj\u00f3sara n\u00f8kkvi.At Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages Snorri also includes D\u00farnir in a list of giants in the Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l section of his Prose Edda (Faulkes translation, p. 157). It is possible that the name Durnir is an emendation of Durinn, mentioned as the father of dvarfs in Dvergatal. Both names mean door, or door-warden. The names Durinn and Durnir do not appear in the same texts. The Norwegian translation of Ynglinga Saga from 1900 uses the name of Durinn instead of Durnir. ==Notes== Category:Norse dwarves Category:J\u00f6tnar ",
