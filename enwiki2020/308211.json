    "text": "This is a list of the best-selling albums in the United States based on RIAA certification and Nielsen SoundScan sales tracking. The criteria are that the album must have been published (including self-publishing by the artist), and the album must have achieved at least a diamond certification from the RIAA. The albums released prior to March 1991 should be included with their certified units only, as their Nielsen SoundScan sales are not complete. Since February 2016, album certifications include \"on-demand audio and video streams and a track sale equivalent\" units. Groupings are based on different benchmarks; the highest being for at least 20 million units, and the lowest being for multi-disc albums certified at least 10 times platinum and single- disc albums that have been certified at least 10 times platinum but with sales figures lower than 10,000,000. Albums are listed in order of units certified, or sales figures when available, by greatest to least. As a result of the RIAA's methodology of counting each disc in a multi-disc set as one unit toward certification, most double albums on the list\u2014such as Pink Floyd's The Wall and Outkast's Speakerboxxx/The Love Below\u2014have been certified with a number double the number of copies sold. Such albums have the shipments of copies, not discs, indicated. Conversely, the certification level for double albums that fit onto one compact disc such as the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack reflect the actual number of copies sold. The albums in this list are ordered first by number of units, then by platinum awards received, and finally by artist name and album title. Albums with two references for their estimated actual sales include sales through BMG Music Club. Albums with three references for their estimated actual sales include sales through BMG Music Club and Columbia House. == More than or equal to 20 million copies == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Year !Artist !Album !Label !Shipments (Sales) !Certification |- |- |1976 |Eagles |Their Greatest Hits (1971\u20131975) |Asylum |38,000,000 |38\u00d7 Platinum |- |1982 | |Thriller |Epic |33,000,000 |33\u00d7 Platinum |- |1976 |Eagles |Hotel California |Asylum |26,000,000 |26\u00d7 Platinum |- |1980 |AC/DC |Back in Black |Atlantic |25,000,000 |25\u00d7 Platinum |- |1971 |Led Zeppelin |Led Zeppelin IV |Atlantic |23,000,000 |23\u00d7 Platinum |- |1977 |Fleetwood Mac |Rumours |Warner Bros. |20,000,000 |20\u00d7 Platinum |- |} == 15\u201319 million copies == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Year !Artist !Album !Label !Shipments (Sales) !Certification |- |1987 |Guns N' Roses |Appetite for Destruction |Geffen |18,000,000 |18\u00d7 Platinum |- |1990 |Garth Brooks |No Fences |Capitol Nashville |18,000,000 |18\u00d7 Platinum |- |1997 | |Come On Over |Mercury Nashville |(17,690,000) |20\u00d7 Platinum |- |1974 | |Greatest Hits |Polydor |17,000,000 |17\u00d7 Platinum |- |1976 |Boston |Boston |Epic Records |17,000,000 |17\u00d7 Platinum |- |1991 |Metallica |Metallica |Elektra |(16,830,000) |16\u00d7 Platinum |- |1977 |Soundtrack / Bee Gees |Saturday Night Fever |RSO |16,000,000 |16\u00d7 Platinum |- |1995 | |Jagged Little Pill |Maverick |(15,550,000) |16\u00d7 Platinum |- |1973 |Pink Floyd |The Dark Side of the Moon |Harvest/Capitol |15,000,000 |15\u00d7 Platinum |- |1984 | |Legend |Island |15,000,000 |15\u00d7 Platinum |- |1984 | |Born in the U.S.A. |Columbia |15,000,000 |15\u00d7 Platinum |- |1988 |Journey |Greatest Hits |Columbia |15,000,000 |15\u00d7 Platinum |- |} == 10\u201314 million copies == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Year !Artist !Album !Label !Shipments (Sales) !Certification |- |1994 |Hootie & the Blowfish |Cracked Rear View |Atlantic |(14,580,000) |21\u00d7 Platinum |- |1972 |Simon & Garfunkel |Simon and Garfunkel's Greatest Hits |Columbia |14,000,000 |14\u00d7 Platinum |- |1977 |Meat Loaf |Bat Out of Hell |Epic Records |14,000,000 |14\u00d7 Platinum |- |1978 |Steve Miller Band |Greatest Hits 1974\u201378 |Capitol |14,000,000 |14\u00d7 Platinum |- |1999 |Backstreet Boys |Millennium |Jive |(13,890,000) |13\u00d7 Platinum |- |1992 |Soundtrack / Whitney Houston |The Bodyguard |Arista |(13,450,000) |18\u00d7 Platinum |- |1999 |Santana |Supernatural |Arista |(13,110,000) |15\u00d7 Platinum |- |1984 |Prince and the Revolution |Purple Rain |Warner Bros. |13,000,000 |13\u00d7 Platinum |- |1985 | |Whitney Houston |Arista |13,000,000 |13\u00d7 Platinum |- |2000 |Eminem |The Marshall Mathers LP |Aftermath |(12,940,000) |10\u00d7 Platinum (as of 2011) |- |2000 | |1 |Apple/EMI/Capitol |(12,800,000) |11\u00d7 Platinum (as of 2010) |- |2000 |NSYNC |No Strings Attached |Jive |(12,680,000) |11\u00d7 Platinum (as of 2001) |- |1999 |Britney Spears |...Baby One More Time |Jive |(12,200,000) |14\u00d7 Platinum |- |1968 | |The Beatles |Capitol |12,000,000 |24\u00d7 Platinum (2-disc album) |- |1969 | |Abbey Road |Apple |12,000,000 |12\u00d7 Platinum |- |1969 |Led Zeppelin |Led Zeppelin II |Atlantic |12,000,000 |12\u00d7 Platinum |- |1980 | |Greatest Hits |Liberty |12,000,000 |12\u00d7 Platinum |- |1985 | |No Jacket Required |Atlantic |12,000,000 |12\u00d7 Platinum |- |1986 |Bon Jovi |Slippery When Wet |Mercury Records |12,000,000 |12\u00d7 Platinum |- |1987 |Def Leppard |Hysteria |Mercury Records |12,000,000 |12\u00d7 Platinum |- |1992 |Kenny G |Breathless |Arista |12,000,000 |12\u00d7 Platinum |- |1997 |Backstreet Boys |Backstreet Boys |Jive |(11,920,000) |14\u00d7 Platinum |- |2011 |Adele |21 |Columbia/XL |(11,870,000) |14\u00d7 Platinum |- |1996 | |Falling into You |Epic Records |(11,799,000) |11\u00d7 Platinum |- |1999 |Creed |Human Clay |Wind-up Records |(11,700,000) |11\u00d7 Platinum |- |1979 |Pink Floyd |The Wall |Columbia/Harvest/EMI |11,500,000 |23\u00d7 Platinum (2-disc album) |- |1985 |Billy Joel |Greatest Hits \u2013 Volume I & Volume II |Columbia |11,500,000 |23\u00d7 Platinum (2-disc album) |- |1997 |Soundtrack |Titanic |Epic Records |(11,146,000) |11\u00d7 Platinum |- |2000 |Linkin Park |Hybrid Theory |Warner Bros. |(11,126,000) |12\u00d7 Platinum |- |2002 | |Come Away with Me |Blue Note |(11,100,000) |10\u00d7 Platinum (as of 2005) |- |1967 | |Sgt.
