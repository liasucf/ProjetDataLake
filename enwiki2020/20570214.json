A fortified house, Langes\u00f8hus (later referred to as Borre), owned by the family, was in the Middle Ages located south of present- day Uggel\u00f8se Skov. The Hvide family seems to have left the area in about 1300. The first known reference to Uggel\u00f8se is from 15 October 1252. Administratively, the villages of Lynge and Uggel\u00f8se were already merged into Lynge-Uggel\u00f8se Sognekommune in 1842.
