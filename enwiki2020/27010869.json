Guiyang is named after master Guishan Lingyou (771\u2013854) and his disciple, Yangshan Huiji (813\u2013890). Guishan was a disciple of Baizhang Huaihai, the Chan master whose disciples included Huangbo Xiyun, who in turn taught Linji Yixuan, founder of the Linji school.Ven. Jian Hu. \"Buddhism in the Modern World\" Stanford University, May 25, 2006, p. 1 After founding the Guiyang School, Yangshan moved his school to what is now modern Jiangxi. The Guiyang school is distinct from the other schools in many ways, notably in its use of esoteric metaphors and imagery in the school's k\u014dans and other teachings. ==lineage== ==Absorption into the Linji school== Over the course of Song Dynasty (960\u20131279), the Guiyang school, along with the Fayan and Yunmen schools were absorbed into the Linji school. Hsu Yun attempted to revive these absorbed lineages and succeeded in the case of the Guiyang school. ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Chan schools ",
