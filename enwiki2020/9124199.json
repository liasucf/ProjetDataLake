    "text": "Fort Halifax was located along the Susquehanna River near the present day borough of Halifax, Pennsylvania, United States. It was a temporary stronghold in northern Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, from 1756 to 1757, during the time of the French and Indian War. The fort was erected by Col. William Clapham, with the order of Governor Morris, and guarded by a garrison of the Third Battalion of the Pennsylvania Provincial Regiment. Fort Halifax was constructed as a subpost along the Susquehanna with three other forts, Fort Harris, Fort Hunter, and Fort Augusta. The fort was originally named \"Camp at Armstrong\" until General Morris changed it in 1756. It was a square log stockade with four bastions. It was dismantled in 1763 having become superfluous at war's end. A stone monument, erected in 1926, is located along Pennsylvania Route 147 north of Halifax along Armstrong Creek. The area of the former fort is now part of the Halifax Township Park and Conservation Area, which consists of bordered on one side by the Susquehanna River and contains a long stretch of Armstrong Creek. Halifax Township was named in commemoration of the fort. ==See also== *List of Forts in the United States ==References== ==External links== * Category:French and Indian War forts Category:Forts in Pennsylvania Category:Colonial forts in Pennsylvania Category:Buildings and structures in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania Category:Protected areas of Dauphin County, Pennsylvania Category:1756 establishments in Pennsylvania ",
