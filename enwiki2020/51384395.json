In addition to social media accounts, the group has hacked the website TechCrunch. In October, BuzzFeed published an article linking the OurMine group to a Saudi Arabian teenager using the name Ahmad Makki on social media. OurMine denied the allegations, claiming that Makki was only a \"fan\" of the group.
