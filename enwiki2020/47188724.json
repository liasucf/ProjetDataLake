He is a professor of computer science at Rutgers University,Faculty listing, Computer Science, Rutgers, retrieved 2015-07-08. and a co-founder of storage technology startup company Tokutek.. Farach-Colton is of Argentine descent, and grew up in South Carolina. While attending medical school, he met his future husband, with whom he now has twin children..

He was program chair of the 14th ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA 2003).14th ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, SIAM, retrieved 2015-07-08. The cache-oblivious B-tree data structures studied by Bender, Demaine, and Farach-Colton beginning in 2000 became the basis for the fractal tree index used by Tokutek's products TokuDB and TokuMX.
