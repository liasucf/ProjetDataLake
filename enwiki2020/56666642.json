    "text": "The Darkside Detective is a 2017 video game developed and published by Spooky Doorway. It was released on 27 July 2017. A limited run of 5,000 physical copies for the Nintendo Switch was released on 26 September 2019. ==Plot== Detective Francis McQueen, who leads the underfunded Darkside Division must investigate evil occurrences in Twin Lakes City. ==Development== Creators Paul Conway and Christopher Colston originally created a short demo at a gaming convention in Galway. The demo was made in under eight hours, but received significant attention after it was posted online, promoting them to turn it into a full game. After decided to enter production on the game, they hired writer Dave McCabe and lead developer Tracey McCabe to assist in the production. During the development process, the team of five would do group read throughs to discuss issues and ideas, with McCabe then creating an interactive version of any ideas that they had using clipart to allow them to further map out how it would work within the game. Once an idea was decided on, the team would then start creating visuals, animations, interactions, sound and music based around the idea. ==Reception== The Darkside Detective received mostly positive reviews and has a score of 81% on Metacritic. Hardcore Gamer awarded it a score of 3.5 out of 5, saying \"The Darkside Detective is a charming point and click adventure with a taste for the sillier aspects of horror.\" Video Gamer awarded it 7 out of 10, saying \"The Darkside Detective has a very distinct sense of humour that you'll either love or hate.\" Ted Hentschke of Dread Central praised the gameplay and atmosphere but criticising its short length, saying \"If the game were 50% longer, I would be in serious danger of genuinely loving it. As it is, it\u2019s just a fun diversion for a few hours.\" Jimmy Donnellan of Cultured Vultures awarded it a score of 8 out of 10, saying \"Funny and offbeat, The Darkside Detective is a joyful but basic point and click game that is simply over too soon.\" However, CJ Andriessen of Destructoid awarded it a more negative score of 5.5 out of 10, and said \"Its lightweight, cornball comedy opts for cheap and easy jokes I never really find funny\", although he did praise both the soundtrack and the art style. ==References== Category:2017 video games Category:Detective video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Windows games Category:Mac OS games Category:Point-and-click adventure games Category:Indie video games Category:Video games developed in Ireland Category:Christmas video games ",
