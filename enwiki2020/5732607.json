It was commonly used by the government of Saddam Hussein (who was himself ultimately executed), was temporarily halted after the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq that deposed Hussein, and has since been reinstated. Iraqi law states that no person over the age of 70 can be executed; however there have been instances in which this provision was violated, such as Tariq Aziz, who was sentenced to death at the age of 74. There is a guaranteed right to appeal on all such sentences. Iraqi Law requires execution take place within 30 days of all legal avenues being exhausted.

Paul Bremer suspended capital punishment on June 10, declaring that \"the former regime used certain provisions of the penal code as a means of oppression, in violation of internationally acknowledged human rights.\" However, on August 8, 2004, capital punishment was reinstated in Iraq.
