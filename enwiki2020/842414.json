He practiced as a lawyer, and then, from 1905 as the city mayor of Split. Trumbi\u0107 was in favor of moderate reforms in Austro-Hungarian Slavic provinces, which included the unification of Dalmatia with Croatia-Slavonia. After the assassination in Sarajevo of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the invasion of Serbia by Austria-Hungary, Trumbi\u0107 became the prominent Yugoslav nationalist leader during World War I, and led the Yugoslav Committee that lobbied the Allies to support the creation of an independent Yugoslavia.Spencer Tucker. Encyclopedia of World War I: A Political, Social, and Military History. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC- CLIO, 2005. pp. 1189. Trumbi\u0107 negotiated with Serbian Prime Minister Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107 to have the Kingdom of Serbia support the creation of a Yugoslav state, which was delivered at the Corfu Declaration on 20 July 1917 that advocated the creation of a united state of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes that would be led by the Serbian House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107. In 1918 he became foreign minister in the first government of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. At the Versailles conference after World War I, Trumbi\u0107 had to represent Yugoslav concerns in the face of Italian territorial ambitions in Dalmatia (temporarily settled in 1920, but raised again with Benito Mussolini). In spite of his support for a united Yugoslavia, Trumbi\u0107 opposed the 1921 constitution over his belief that it was too centralized and allowed Serb hegemony over Yugoslavia. Trumbi\u0107 was one of 35 representatives to vote against the constitution amid a wide boycott of the National Assembly by opposition parties.Sabrina P. Ramet, The three Yugoslavias: state-building and legitimation, 1918\u20132005. Indiana University Press, 2006. (p. 57) Trumbi\u0107 grew steadily disillusioned with the Yugoslav government over time which he saw as Serb-dominated. He was elected for the last time in the 1927 elections on the list of the Croatian Bloc representing Zagreb together with Ante Paveli\u0107. In 1929, claiming to bring an end to the ongoing bickering between the Serbian and the Croatian representatives within the kingdom, King Alexander of Yugoslavia staged a coup d'\u00e9tat and banned all political parties, and removed the individual nationalities Serb and Croat from the bigger picture. He renamed the land Yugoslavia, and abrogated the constitution to establish a royal dictatorship. Trumbi\u0107 was by now in retirement in Zagreb. King Alexander's division of Croatia-Slavonia and Dalmatia into oblasts and then into banovinas, countered all previous reforms Trumbi\u0107 had sought. In a September 1932 interview with The Manchester Guardian Trumbi\u0107 wondered whether Croatia should separate from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and pursue a union with Austria.Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer, Balkan strongmen: dictators and authoritarian rulers of South Eastern Europe. Purdue University Press, 2007. (p. 79) In November 1932 Trumbi\u0107 edited the Zagreb Points, a series of demands put forth by the Peasant-Democratic coalition to counter Serbian hegemony. With the arrest of Croatian Peasant Party leader Vladko Ma\u010dek in April 1933 Trumbi\u0107 and Josip Predavec became the caretaker heads of the party.Alex N. Dragnich, The first Yugoslavia: search for a viable political system. Hoover Press, 1983. (p. 95) With Predavec's assassination on 14 July, Trumbi\u0107 was essentially the head of the party in Ma\u010dek's absence. According to Henri Pozzi, Trumbi\u0107 later regretted the end of Austria-Hungary,Henri Pozzi, Black Hand over Europe (La Guerre Revient...). F. Mott and Co, 1935. as the South Slav state he had helped to create proved incapable of his intended reforms. ==References== ==External links== * FirstWorldWar.com biography of Ante Trumbi\u0107 * Leadership in Austria-Hungary during WWI Category:1864 births Category:1938 deaths Category:People from Split, Croatia Category:People from the Kingdom of Dalmatia Category:Party of Rights politicians Category:Croatian Peasant Party politicians Category:Foreign ministers of Yugoslavia Category:Representatives in the Yugoslav National Assembly (1921\u20131941) Category:Mayors of Split, Croatia Category:Yugoslavism ",
