The experiment goes well, but accidentally Dolf is stranded in the 13th century. He saves the life of Leonardo Fibonacci da Pisa, without realizing who he is, and teaches him Arabic numerals. Together they join the German Children's Crusade, and through his modern-day knowledge, Rudolf manages to save a lot of children from horrible fates. However, his knowledge also leads to accusations of witchcraft. In the book, two slavers delude a group of children into coming with them with stories of how the innocent shall liberate Jerusalem. Their actual intent is to sell them as slaves for profit. With the aid of his twentieth-century knowledge and skepticism, and the aid of a \"magical\" device or two (such as a box of matches), the boy manages to keep most of the children alive and eventually gets them to safety. ==Characters== ;Dolf: Born in Amstelveen, his full name is Rudolf Hefting, and at the age of 15 becomes the active leader of the crusade. ;Leonardo: Born in Pisa, his full name is Leonardo Fibonacci.
