When the Legislature passed a law allowing people with carry permits to take their handguns into bars, Dread, and a team of lawyers, sued the State of Tennessee. They alleged that the law was passed due to fraudulent facts provided by lobbyists. In addition to the public safety and economic arguments, the team argued that the law was unconstitutional on its face, and created an unsafe work environment, thus violating OSHA standards. Dread debated this issue multiple times on Fox & Friends. The case is still pending in Chancery Court. In September 2009, Dread joined Brady Campaign President, Paul Helmke, in a debate with NRA lobbyists at the University of Tennessee at Martin campus. == References == Category:1963 births Category:Metropolitan Council members (Nashville, Tennessee) Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Pittsburgh ",
