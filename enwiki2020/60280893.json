    "text": "Jack Sullivan (born \u20132000) is the managing director of West Ham United Women. He is the son of West Ham United owner, David Sullivan. ==Social media and journalism== Sullivan first came to public attention following his controversial use of Twitter to discuss West Ham United's club affairs and transfers. In 2013, commenting on the signing of Marouane Chamakh, Sullivan wrote \"I am very sorry about this news Chamakh has sign a 6 month loan deal! not my pick :(\". In 2015, Sullivan posted a picture of West Ham manager, Sam Allardyce laughing in a tweet mocking West Ham rivals, Millwall following their relegation to League One. Sullivan was criticised by Graeme Souness for his use of Twitter. Souness wrote in The Times that the use of Twitter to criticise the manager\u2019s selections, substitutions and signings was unacceptable. Former West Ham manager, Sam Allardyce, blamed owner David Sullivan for giving the information to his son and for allowing him to tweet it. Sullivan also wrote a column called The Insider on West Ham's website. This discussed transfer targets and fees and was pulled from the club's official website on the orders of West Ham's managing director, Karren Brady after she had been inundated with complaints from supporters. Following this Sullivan was engaged by The Sun tabloid newspaper to write a twice monthly column. ==West Ham United Women== Sullivan was appointed as managing director of West Ham Women, by his father, in 2017. He had been involved with the women's team since leaving school aged 16. In Sullivan's first year, he led an application to advance the club from the part-time third division to the Women's Super League; it was West Ham's first appearance in the top competition. In 2018 he was the subject of a BBC Three programme, Britain's Youngest Football Boss, focusing on his running of the club and on the lives of female footballers. The programme was later shown on BBC One after Match of the Day, achieving viewing figures of 1.3 million. ==Personal life== Sullivan attended Chigwell School. He has dyslexia. In the Sunday Times Rich List produced in May 2020, Sullivan was listed as the third richest person aged under 30 in the UK. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Association football supporters Category:West Ham United F.C.
