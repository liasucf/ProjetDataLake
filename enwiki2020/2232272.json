The pilot, Hern\u00e1n Gallego, mistook it for San Bartolome (Bokak Atoll), which Toribio Alonso de Salazar had seen in 1526, although Bokak was a long way to the north. Menda\u00f1a says they named them San Mateo Shoals. The islands were inhabited, with many houses. A landing party found a chisel made of a nail and pieces of rope which were presumably gifts left there on 3 July 1566 by the galleon San Jer\u00f3nimo, then commanded by the rebel pilot Lope Mart\u00edn.Sharp, Andrew The discovery of the Pacific Islands Oxford, 1960, p.40,47. The Empire of Germany claimed Namu Atoll along with the rest of the Marshall Islands in 1884, and the Germans established a trading post. After World War I, the island came under the South Pacific Mandate of the Empire of Japan. Following the end of World War II, it came under the control of the United States as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands until 1986 when the Marshall Islands achieved their independence. ==Education== Marshall Islands Public School System operates public schools:\"Public Schools .\" Marshall Islands Public School System.
