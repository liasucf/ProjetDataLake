    "text": "' (also written (119070) 2001 KP77') is a 4:7 resonant trans-Neptunian object (TNO) located in the Kuiper belt. It was discovered on May 23, 2001, by Marc W. Buie at Cerro Tololo. ==Color== has the highest, and thus reddest measured B\u2212V color index of any TNO. On April 19, 2002, set a TNO record B\u2212V of 1.544. In the visible spectrum would appear an orange-brown depending on its albedo. ==Size== Based on an absolute magnitude (H) of 6.93, is estimated to be between 110 \u2013 240 km in diameter.Conversion of Absolute Magnitude to Diameter ==References== == External links == * 4:7 Resonance, Johnston's Archive * TNO Colors * KBO Surface Colors * 119070 Category:Discoveries by Marc W.
