    "text": "The Bird/Boyd Farm House is a single-family home located at 14215 Bird Road in Byron, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. ==History== Brothers Elijah and Edward Bird were early settlers in this area, and owned the land this house sits on. It is reasonably certain that one of them constructed this house in about 1846. It was owned by the Bird family until at least the early 1980s. ==Description== The Bird/Boyd Farm House is a L-shaped frame Greek Revival structure. The facade has a classically ornamented entrance, pilasters on the corners of the building, and a wide frieze with a boxed cornice running across the top. The ell portion of the house is fronted by a recessed porch. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Genesee County, Michigan Category:Greek Revival architecture in Michigan Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1846 ",
