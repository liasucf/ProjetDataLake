    "text": "Alexandre Rodolphe Vinet (June 17, 1797May 4, 1847), was a Swiss critic and theologian. ==Literary critic== He was born near Lausanne in Switzerland. Educated for the Protestant ministry, he was ordained in 1819, when already teacher of the French language and literature in the gymnasium at Basel; and throughout his life he was as much a critic as a theologian. His literary criticism brought him into contact with Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, for whom he obtained an invitation to lecture at Lausanne, which led to his famous work on Port-Royal. This work in turn cites: *L. M. Lane, Life and Writings of A. Vinet (1890) *L. Molines, \u00c9tude sur Alexandre Vinet (Paris, 1890) *Eug\u00e8ne Rambert biography (1875; he re-edited the Chrestomathie in 1876) *V. Rivet, \u00c9tudes sur les origines de la pens\u00e9e religieuse de Vinet (Paris, 1896) *V. Rossel, Histoire de la litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise hors de France (Lausanne, 1895) *A. Schumann, Alex. Vinet (1907) Vinet's Chrestomathie fran\u00e7aise (1829), his \u00c9tudes sur la litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise au XIXme si\u00e8cle (1840\u201351), and his Histoire de la litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise au XVIIIme si\u00e8cle, together with his \u00c9tudes sur Pascal, \u00c9tudes sur les moralistes aux XVIme et XVIIme si\u00e8cles, Histoire de la pr\u00e9dication parmi les R\u00e9form\u00e9s de France and other related works, gave evidence of a wide knowledge of literature, acute literary judgment and a distinguished faculty of appreciation. He adjusted his theories to the work under review, and condemned nothing as long as it met his literary standards. ==Theologian== As a theologian Vinet gave a fresh impulse to Protestant theology, especially in French-speaking lands, but also in England and elsewhere. Lord Acton classed him with Richard Rothe. His philosophy relied strongly on conscience, defined as that by which man stands in direct personal relation with God as moral sovereign, and the seat of a moral individuality which nothing can rightly infringe. He advocated complete freedom of religious belief, and to this end the formal separation of church and state in M\u00e9moire en faveur de la libert\u00e9 des cultes (1826), Essai sur la conscience (1829), Essai sur la manifestation des convictions religieuses (1842). Accordingly, when in 1845 the civil power in the canton of Vaud interfered with the church's autonomy, he led a secession which took the name of L'\u00c9glise libre. But already from 1831, when he published his Discours sur quelques sujets religieux (Nouveaux discours, 1841), he had begun to exert a liberalizing and deepening influence on religious thought far beyond his own canton, by bringing traditional doctrine to the test of a living personal experience (see also the philosophy of Gaston Frommel). In this he resembled Frederick William Robertson, as also in the change which he introduced into pulpit style and in the permanence of his influence. Vinet died at Clarens (Vaud). A considerable part of his work was not printed till after his death. ==References== ==Further reading== * *W.P. Keijzer, Vinet en Hollande (Groningen, 1941) *W.P.
