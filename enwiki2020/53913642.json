On October 13, 2018, Godfrey Farrugia was appointed as the new leader of the Democratic Party. Timothy Alden welcomed the news proclaiming Godfrey Farrugia to be Malta's very own Cincinnatus.

In late October 2018, Farrugia said that the Democratic Party is proposing to set up a new anti-organised crime commission.
