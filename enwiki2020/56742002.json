    "text": "The D.H. and Leah Curran House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. It is a one-and-a-half-story frame house on a concrete foundation. It was deemed > architecturally significant as a well-preserved local example of late > Craftsman residential design. In South Dakota as well as elsewhere in the > United States, residential architecture during the early twentieth century > was heavily influenced by the Craftsman building form, an indigenous > American style popularized through numerous pattern books and popular > publications. In many areas of the country, simple variants of the Craftsman > form saw near-universal use in working-class home construction during the > 1910s and 1920s. Larger, high-style examples were less common, but still saw > frequent use in many areas. Gettysburg generally followed this national > design trend, and a number of small and mid-sized Craftsman homes remain in > the community. The Curran house is a fine local example of the form, larger > than most and with a high level of design detail. It remains today strongly > reflective of the period in which it was built. It has also been known as the Herbert G. Beath House and the Carl and Dorothy Cronin House.
