    "text": "Green Bay Glory is an American women's professional soccer club based in Green Bay, Wisconsin, which plays in the Women's Premier Soccer League. The team was formed in January 2019 and played its first WPSL season in 2019. ==History== On January 11, 2019, Kerry Geocaris and Melissa Cruz-Cuene announced a new Women's Premier Soccer League team in Green Bay, called the Glory. Geocaris, a Green Bay native, had previously played for another WPSL team, the Milwaukee Torrent, and cited a lack of competitive women's soccer opportunities in the Green Bay area as a major factor in forming the Glory. The team was announced to play in the newly-formed Midwest Division as one of 29 expansion teams for the league. Chad Johnson was named coach, and the team was announced to play at Capital Credit Union Park, though they later moved to Aldo Santaga Stadium at University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. ==Stadium== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! style=\"background:#ECCEF2; color:#001E62; text- align:center;\"|Name ! style=\"background:#ECCEF2; color:#001E62; text- align:center;\"|Location ! style=\"background:#ECCEF2; color:#001E62; text- align:center;\"|Years in use |- | Aldo Santaga Stadium | Green Bay, Wisconsin | 2019\u2013present |} After originally being announced to play at Capital Credit Union Park, the Glory played their inaugural season at Aldo Santaga Stadium on the campus of University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. ==Current squad== ==Year-by- year== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !League !Reg.
