    "text": "In geometry, a pentadecagon or pentakaidecagon or 15-gon is a fifteen-sided polygon. ==Regular pentadecagon== A regular pentadecagon is represented by Schl\u00e4fli symbol {15}. A regular pentadecagon has interior angles of 156\u00b0, and with a side length a, has an area given by : \\begin{align} A = \\frac{15}{4}a^2 \\cot \\frac{\\pi}{15} & = \\frac{15}{4}\\sqrt{7+2\\sqrt{5}+2\\sqrt{15+6\\sqrt{5}}}a^2 \\\\\\ & = \\frac{15a^2}{8} \\left( \\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{15}+ \\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{5+\\sqrt{5}} \\right) \\\\\\ & \\simeq 17.6424\\,a^2. \\end{align} == Uses == 160px A regular triangle, decagon, and pentadecagon can not completely fill a plane vertex. ===Construction=== As 15 = 3 \u00d7 5, a product of distinct Fermat primes, a regular pentadecagon is constructible using compass and straightedge: The following constructions of regular pentadecagons with given circumcircle are similar to the illustration of the proposition XVI in Book IV of Euclid's Elements.

Retrieved on June 5, 2017 The point H divides the radius \\overline{AM} in golden ratio: \\frac{\\overline{AH}}{\\overline{HM}} = \\frac{\\overline{AM}}{\\overline{AH}} = \\frac{1+ \\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\Phi \\approx 1.618 \\text{.} Compared with the first animation (with green lines) are in the following two images the two circular arcs (for angles 36\u00b0 and 24\u00b0) rotated 90\u00b0 counterclockwise shown. They do not use the segment \\overline{CG}, but rather they use segment \\overline{MG} as radius \\overline{AH} for the second circular arc (angle 36\u00b0). 01-F\u00fcnfzehneck01-F\u00fcnfzehneckAnimation A compass and straightedge construction for a given side length. The construction is nearly equal to that of the pentagon at a given side, then also the presentation is succeed by extension one side and it generates a segment, here \\overline{FE_2}\\text{,} which is divided according to the golden ratio: \\frac{\\overline{E_1 E_2}}{\\overline{E_1 F}} = \\frac{\\overline{E_2 F}}{\\overline{E_1 E_2}} = \\frac{1+ \\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\Phi \\approx 1.618 \\text{.} Circumradius \\overline{E_2 M} = R\\;;\\;\\; Side length \\overline{E_1 E_2} = a\\;;\\;\\; Angle D E_1M = ME_2D = 78^\\circ \\begin{align} R &= a \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(\\sqrt{5 + 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{5}} + \\sqrt{3} \\right)= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{8+ 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{5}+2\\sqrt{15 + 6 \\cdot \\sqrt{5}}}\\cdot a\\\\\\ &= \\frac {\\sin (78^\\circ)}{ \\sin (24^\\circ)} \\cdot a \\approx 2.40486\\cdot a \\end{align} == Symmetry== The symmetries of a regular pentadecagon as shown with colors on edges and vertices. Lines of reflections are blue. Gyrations are given as numbers in the center. Vertices are colored by their symmetry positions. The regular pentadecagon has Dih15 dihedral symmetry, order 30, represented by 15 lines of reflection. Dih15 has 3 dihedral subgroups: Dih5, Dih3, and Dih1. And four more cyclic symmetries: Z15, Z5, Z3, and Z1, with Zn representing \u03c0/n radian rotational symmetry. On the pentadecagon, there are 8 distinct symmetries. John Conway labels these symmetries with a letter and order of the symmetry follows the letter.John H. Conway, Heidi Burgiel, Chaim Goodman-Strauss, (2008) The Symmetries of Things, (Chapter 20, Generalized Schaefli symbols, Types of symmetry of a polygon pp. 275-278) He gives r30 for the full reflective symmetry, Dih15. He gives d (diagonal) with reflection lines through vertices, p with reflection lines through edges (perpendicular), and for the odd-sided pentadecagon i with mirror lines through both vertices and edges, and g for cyclic symmetry. a1 labels no symmetry. These lower symmetries allows degrees of freedoms in defining irregular pentadecagons. Only the g15 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can seen as directed edges. ===Pentadecagrams=== There are three regular star polygons: {15/2}, {15/4}, {15/7}, constructed from the same 15 vertices of a regular pentadecagon, but connected by skipping every second, fourth, or seventh vertex respectively. There are also three regular star figures: {15/3}, {15/5}, {15/6}, the first being a compound of three pentagons, the second a compound of five equilateral triangles, and the third a compound of three pentagrams. The compound figure {15/3} can be loosely seen as the two-dimensional equivalent of the 3D compound of five tetrahedra. {| class=wikitable width=360 |- align=center valign=top !
