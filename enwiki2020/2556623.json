She was appointed as chancellor of the University of Salford in 2015. ==Biography== Jackie Kay was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1961, to a Scottish mother and a Nigerian father. She was adopted as a baby by a white Scottish couple, Helen and John Kay, and grew up in Bishopbriggs, a suburb of Glasgow. They adopted Jackie in 1961, having already adopted her brother, Maxwell, about two years earlier. Jackie and Maxwell also have siblings who were brought up by their biological parents. Her adoptive father worked for the Communist Party full-time and stood for Member of Parliament,Jackie Kay, \"My old man: a voyage around our fathers\", The Observer, 15 June 2008. and her adoptive mother was the Scottish secretary of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. As a child Kay suffered racism from children and teachers at school. As a teenager she worked as a cleaner, working for David Cornwell\u2014who wrote under the pen-name John le Carr\u00e9\u2014for four months. She recommended cleaning work to aspiring writers, saying: \"It\u2019s great ... You\u2019re listening to everything. You can be a spy, but nobody thinks you're taking anything in.\" Cornwell and Kay met again in 2019; he remembered her, and had been following her. In August 2007, Jackie Kay was the subject of the fourth episode of the BBC Radio 4 series The House I Grew Up In, in which she talked about her childhood. John Kay died in 2019 at the age of 93.

She studied English at the University of Stirling and her first book of poetry, the partially autobiographical The Adoption Papers, was published in 1991 and won the Saltire Society Scottish First Book Award. It is a multiply voiced collection of poetry that deals with identity, race, nationality, gender, and sexuality from the perspectives of three women: an adopted biracial child, her adoptive mother, and her biological mother. Her other awards include the 1994 Somerset Maugham Award for Other Lovers, and the Guardian Fiction Prize for Trumpet, inspired by the life of American jazz musician Billy Tipton, born Dorothy Tipton, who lived as a man for the last fifty years of his life. Kay writes extensively for stage (in 1988 her play Twice Over was the first by a Black writer to be produced by Gay Sweatshop Theatre Group),\"Gay Sweatshop Theatre Company\", Unfinished Histories \u2013 Recording the History of Alternative Theatre. screen and for children.
