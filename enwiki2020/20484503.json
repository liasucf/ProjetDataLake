    "text": "International Interactive Communications Society (IICS) is a professional trade association for companies and individuals involved in interactive media. The organization traces its roots to the days of interactive laser disc production in the San Francisco Bay Area during the 1980s. Originally the society was proposed as a special interest group of the International Television Association (ITVA), now known as Media Communications Association \u2013 International (MCA-I), but the charter members decided to establish the society as an independent entity with different membership requirements for the new interactive and computer based communications. The charter members were composed of equipment vendors, independent producers, training professionals and members of Apple's IIe computer group, Sony's SMC-70 computer & interactive LaserDisc groups and Pioneer's interactive Laserdisc groups. In its heyday the organization had hundreds of members in the San Francisco Bay Area and thousands of members worldwide with chapters in Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta, San Diego, Detroit (Great Lakes). ==Charter members== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | Tom Wohlmut|| Original IICS President || currently President WMS Media Inc., San Francisco |- | Debra Wohlmut (Anderson)|| Founding IICS Vice-President || Exec.
