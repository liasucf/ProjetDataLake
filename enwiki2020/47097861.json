    "text": "Caleb Sylvester Swanigan (born April 18, 1997) is an American professional basketball player for the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Purdue Boilermakers. He was ranked among the top prep players in the national class of 2015 by Rivals.com, Scout.com and ESPN. He completed his senior season in the 2014\u201315 academic year for Homestead High School, who went on to win the first state championship in the school's history. Swanigan was named Indiana's Mr. Basketball and a McDonald's All-American. Swanigan originally committed to Michigan State University, but later decommitted and committed to Purdue University. He was named Big Ten Freshman of the Week three times, a record at Purdue. He was also named to the Big Ten All-Freshman Team and also received a National Freshman of the Week award. Swanigan finished the season with 10.2 points per game and 8.3 rebounds per game. During his sophomore year, Swanigan was named the Big Ten Player of the Year and first-team All-Big Ten, and was a unanimous first-team All-American. He was a finalist for the 2017 Karl Malone Award, given to the nation's top power forward. On June 22, 2017, he was selected 26th overall in the first round of the 2017 NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers. ==Early life== Caleb Swanigan, born April 18, 1997, grew up in an unstable home due to his father, Carl Swanigan Sr., who had a crack cocaine addiction. Swanigan's mother, Tanya, had six children. Swanigan moved between Utah and Indianapolis, Indiana during his youth, spending time in homeless shelters. Swanigan inherited two key features from his biological father\u2014height and a tendency to obesity. The elder Swanigan, who died in 2014 from complications from diabetes, was and weighed nearly at his death. By the time Swanigan was entering eighth grade, he was and . Swanigan has described his bad eating habits as primarily eating desserts and being surrounded by unhealthy food due to his family's financial situation. Swanigan's large size was the reason his aunt nicknamed him \"Biggie,\" often saying \"Biggie Biggie Biggie, can't you see.\" His weight issues, according to ESPN writer Myron Medcalf, were also a symptom of his unstable home situation. His father had many brushes with the law, battled drug addiction for most of his adult life, and physically assaulted his wife. According to a story in Bleacher Report, he was accidentally dropped by his mother as an infant, leaving a bruise on his face; this incident led her to move with her children to Salt Lake City. For the next decade, the family bounced between Indianapolis and Utah; he recalled that he lived in five different homeless shelters and attended 13 different schools by the time he was 13. When his mother decided to move the family to Houston, his older brother Carl Jr., concerned that Caleb would keep gaining weight if he moved with his mother, called his former AAU basketball coach, Roosevelt Barnes, a former three-sport star at Purdue who played on the school's 1980 Final Four team and now a successful sports agent. Barnes, living in Fort Wayne, Indiana, agreed to take Caleb in if he could adopt him and raise him as his own son. Barnes adopted Swanigan prior to his 8th grade year. Barnes addressed Swanigan's eating habits and, after receiving clearance from a cardiologist, began putting him through workouts similar to those Barnes himself went through in college. By the time Swanigan finished high school, he had slimmed down to . ==High school career== Swanigan in the 2015 McDonald's All-America game In the fall of 2011, Swanigan attended a basketball camp led by NBA former coach John Lucas after Barnes convinced Lucas to let him into the invite-only camp in Louisville. When it came to selecting his high school, Swanigan's guardian Barnes said, \"When he chose his high school, his high school had never really done much in the tournament, and his goal was to win a state championship at a school where that had never been done before.\" Swanigan attended Homestead High School and wore the same number as Barnes, number 44. As a senior, he was named Indiana Mr. Basketball and led Homestead to a first-ever state title. He was ranked as a top-20 national prospect in his class. He was named a McDonald's All-American. Swanigan averaged 22.6 points and 13.7 rebounds as a senior. Academically, Swanigan maintained a 3.1 GPA and graduated in three years instead of the usual four. ==College career== ===Recruiting=== Swanigan had several teams recruit him and offer scholarships; Arizona, Kentucky, Cal, and Duke were among the schools that gave Swanigan an offer. Caleb Swanigan verbally committed to Michigan State on April 10, 2015, but decommitted on May 7. He said, \"I just felt like it was better basketball-wise for me.\" Similar to his high school decision, Barnes said, \"He wants to win a national championship and said he wants to do it in the state of Indiana and wanted to do it at a place he's never done it before.\" Some people believe Barnes had ulterior motives in adopting Swanigan, to which Barnes said, \"Maybe if I wanted to develop the next hot-dog-eating champion, the next Joey Chestnut, people would have a legitimate gripe.\" Swanigan had not consulted Barnes before he committed to Michigan State, and some believe that since Barnes played sports at Purdue he was a major influence in Swanigan decommitting from Michigan State. Barnes said that was not the reason Swanigan switched, and the primary reason for Swanigan choosing Purdue was the presence of two centers that were taller than 7', Isaac Haas and A.J. Hammons, which allowed Swanigan to play the 4 spot. He decided to stay in-state and chose Purdue on May 19. Swanigan announced his decision by tweeting \"#BoilerUp\". Swanigan was Purdue's first Indiana's Mr. Basketball recruit since Glenn Robinson in 1991, and was the first McDonald's All- American for Purdue since 1996.

After his freshman season, Swanigan was one out of 162 underclassmen to enter their names for the 2016 NBA Draft. However, despite being one of 63 invitees for the NBA Draft Combine that year, he ultimately decided to return to college on May 25, which was also the new date set for players to withdraw their names from the draft and try again for another year. An NBA scout said, \"I think he has a chance if he can improve his jump shot and help defense. Big-time rebounder, works hard on his own. He's still more undersized center than power forward, though.\" ===2016\u201317 season=== Similar to his freshman year, Swanigan started every game as a sophomore.
