Rowbury gave birth to her daughter on June 30, 2018.https://www.instagram.com/p/BkqwVtaF0kb/ ==Running career== ===Collegiate=== Rowbury set a school record for the mile in the indoor track season as a freshman at Duke. In her sophomore year she earned indoor All-American status, finishing in 8th place at the NCAA championships in the mile. In her junior year season she anchored Duke's first victorious distance medley relay team. As a senior, she helped Duke place third at the NCAA cross country championships. She redshirted her indoor and outdoor seasons of her senior year, but set Duke school records in the 800m, 1500m, 3000m, 5000m and steeplechase, the latter at 9.59.4.; ===2007=== Rowbury signed with Nike in June 2007. Her first six months of training under John Cook involved rehabilitation from her stress fracture. In November 2007, Rowbury competed at the Seagate Elite 5K Road Race in San Jose, California to assess her current fitness level coming back from her injury. She managed a second-place finish, with a time of 15:54. ===2008=== In January 2008, Rowbury enjoyed her first extended stint at altitude in central Mexico where she trained for six weeks with her coach and teammates. She returned to the United States in February to compete in the USA Indoor Track and Field Championships, her first track race since her injury 11 months earlier. Rowbury went on to win the 3000 m in a personal best time of 8:55.19. In April 2008, Rowbury opened up her outdoor track campaign at the Duke Invitational, winning the 800 m by 12 seconds with a two-second personal best time of 2:02.76. Her next race was in early May at the Payton Jordon Invitational at Stanford University where she hoped to achieve the Olympic A standard at 1500 m (4:07.00). Although Rowbury came up short of her goal while racing at Stanford, she did manage a five-second personal best at this distance with a time of 4:07.59. Still seeking the Olympic A standard, Rowbury raced at the Adidas Track Classic in Carson, California on May 18, 2008. In the 1500 m, she won with a time of 4:01.61, improving another six seconds over her previous personal best. This performance placed Rowbury her 5th all-time at 1500 m for United States females. In addition, her effort would have placed her 9th in the world rankings based on the 2007 IAAF world performance list. This performance gave her the Olympic A standard that she needed heading into the USATF Olympic Trials. On July 6, 2008 at the USATF Olympic Trials in Eugene, Oregon, Rowbury placed first in the 1500 m final with a time of 4:05.48, followed by Erin Donohue and Christin Wurth-Thomas. The three qualified to compete at the 2008 Beijing Olympics based on their performance at the trials. Rowbury had the fourth-fastest time in the first-round heats of the women's 1500 m run in Beijing, qualifying for the finals. She was the only American athlete to advance to the finals, where she placed seventh with a time of 4:03.58. Her seventh-place finish was (as of then) the best finish ever by an American woman in the 1500 meters at the modern Olympics. ===2009=== Rowbury retained her 1500 m title at the 2009 US Championships, beating Christin Wurth-Thomas and qualifying for the 2009 World Championships in Athletics.Morse, Parker (2009-06-28).

IAAF. Retrieved on 2009-09-27. ===2010=== In 2010, Rowbury finished second in the 1500 meters at the US Indoor Championships, and third at the US Championships outdoors.

She later finished third in the 5000 meters at the USATF Championships, qualifying her for her third consecutive World Championship team. Because Treniere Moser, who was on the world championships team for the 1500 meters, pulled out of the 1500 meters at the Moscow world championships due to a hamstring injury, Rowbury could have run the 1500 meters at the world championships, but was forced to run the 5000 meters due to a technicality. Rowbury finished 7th in the 5000 meters in Moscow at the 2013 IAAF World Championship, just behind her compatriot Molly Huddle.

Just two weeks later at the Monaco Diamond League meeting she recorded a new lifetime best in the 5000m finishing behind American Record holder Molly Huddle in the race. Her time of 14:48.68 saw her go under the 15 minute barrier for the first time and slice 12 seconds off her previous personal best, the time also ranks her as the fourth best American ever to run the distance. ===2015=== Rowbury, still training under Alberto Salazar, raced in five indoor races with her capstone performances earning gold medals in 4:34.40 mile and 9:43.94 two-mile at USA Indoor Track and Field Championships. {| class=wikitable |+ UW Indoor Preview, Seattle, WA !Date||Distance||Place||Time |- align=center |January 17, 2015|| Mile ||bgcolor=gold| 1st || 4:27.86 |- align=center |January 17, 2015 || 1000m ||bgcolor=gold| 1st || 2:40.25 |} Rowbury won the Millrose Games women's Wanamaker mile in 4:24.32.
