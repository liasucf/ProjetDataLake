It was dismantled and rebuilt within the same prefecture, in the town of Hobara Town in Date City. The house is designated an Important Cultural Property of Japan. == History == The house was originally constructed in about Meiji 37 (1904) by the Kameoka family, who profited from silk manufacturing in Koori Town. The building was not donated to the former Hobara Town (present day Date City) until Showa 61 (1986). It was later deconstructed and relocated to Hobara Total Park (Hobara Sougou Kouen) in Heisei 7 (1995). Although the outside of the structure exhibits a Western style, the inside includes a mix of Japanese architectural features. The house is managed by Date City's Hobara Museum of History and Culture. == Architecture == The design of the building is attributed to Egawa Sabur\u014dhachi (\u6c5f\u5ddd\u4e09\u90ce\u516b), whose plan was executed by carpenter Ogasawara Kunitar\u014d (\u5927\u5de5\u5c0f\u7b20\u539f\u56fd\u592a\u90ce) of Iizaka. The house is made of wood and includes two floors of tatami mat rooms, as well as an attic floor with an East Asian hip-and-gable roof covered in tile. The exterior of the house is pale yellow in color and takes on a Western appearance. In the center of the facade of the house is a tower with an eight sided room protruding from the third floor. The interior of the house is Japanese is style. Wide washitsu rooms are arranged in the center of each floor. Detailed woodwork using valuable wood, including Japanese zelkova and imports from Southeast Asia are spread throughout the house.
