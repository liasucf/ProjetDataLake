    "text": "William High Keim (June 13, 1813 - May 18, 1862) was a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania, as well as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. ==Early life and career== William High Keim (a nephew of George May Keim) was born near Reading, Pennsylvania. He attended Mount Airy Military School and attained the rank of major general in the state militia. Keim served as Mayor of Reading in 1848. Keim was elected as a Republican to the Thirty-fifth Congress to fill a short term vacancy caused by the resignation of J. Glancy Jones after Jones's defeat in the election of 1858. He was surveyor general of Pennsylvania from 1860 to 1862. ==Civil War== During the Civil War, Keim enlisted in the Union Army for a term of 3 months and, due primarily to his political ties to Governor Andrew Curtin, he was commissioned as a major general of Pennsylvania Volunteers on April 20, 1861. His original term of enlistment having expired, he was honorably mustered out on July 21, 1861, and returned to Reading. As the war lengthened and it became evident that a quick victory was not in sight, Keim decided to re-enlist, this time for a term of 3 years. Governor Curtin commissioned him as a brigadier general of volunteers on December 20, 1861. However, Keim died of typhus while in the military service at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in 1862. Interment was in the Charles Evans Cemetery in Reading. ==See also== *Ex parte Merryman *List of American Civil War generals (Union) ==References== Retrieved on 2008-02-12 *The Political Graveyard Category:1813 births Category:1862 deaths Category:Burials at Charles Evans Cemetery Category:Politicians from Reading, Pennsylvania Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania Category:Union Army generals Category:People of Pennsylvania in the American Civil War Category:Pennsylvania Republicans Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:Deaths from typhus Category:19th-century American politicians Category:United States politicians killed during the Civil War ",
